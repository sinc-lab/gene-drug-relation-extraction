3proteolix,

the  xxxg1859xxx   xxxg1860xxx   xxxg1861xxx   xxxg1863xxx   xxxg1864xxx  has emerged as an important target for cancer therapy with the
approval of bortezomib, a first-in-class,
reversible  xxxg1859xxx   xxxg1860xxx   xxxg1861xxx   xxxg1863xxx   xxxg1864xxx  inhibitor, for
relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma
(mm). however, many patients have disease
that does not respond to bortezomib,
whereas others develop resistance, suggesting the need for other inhibitors with enhanced activity. we therefore evaluated a
novel, irreversible, epoxomicin-related  xxxg1859xxx   xxxg1860xxx   xxxg1861xxx   xxxg1863xxx   xxxg1864xxx  inhibitor,  xxxd441xxx . in models of
mm, this agent potently bound and specifically inhibited the chymotrypsin-like protea-

some and immunoproteasome activities, resulting in accumulation of ubiquitinated
substrates.  xxxd441xxx  induced a dose- and
time-dependent inhibition of proliferation,
ultimately leading to apoptosis. programmed
cell death was associated with activation of
c-jun-n-terminal kinase, mitochondrial
membrane depolarization, release of  xxxg569xxx , and activation of both intrinsic
and extrinsic caspase pathways. this agent
also inhibited proliferation and activated
apoptosis in patient-derived mm cells and
neoplastic cells from patients with other
hematologic malignancies. importantly, carf-

ilzomib showed increased efficacy compared with bortezomib and was active
against bortezomib-resistant mm cell lines
and samples from patients with clinical bortezomib resistance.  xxxd441xxx  also overcame resistance to other conventional
agents and acted synergistically with dexamethasone to enhance cell death. taken
together, these data provide a rationale for
the clinical evaluation of  xxxd441xxx  in mm.

introduction
the 26s  xxxg1859xxx   xxxg1860xxx   xxxg1861xxx   xxxg1863xxx   xxxg1864xxx  plays a critical role in cellular homeostasis
through its function in ubiquitin-dependent protein turnover, including targets involved in cell-cycle progression, apoptosis, dna
repair, stress response, and misfolded and obsolete proteins.1 major
catalytic activities of the 20s core of the  xxxg1859xxx   xxxg1860xxx   xxxg1861xxx   xxxg1863xxx   xxxg1864xxx  include
a chymotrypsin-like (cht-l) activity found in the ␤5 subunit,
a trypsin-like (t-l) activity in subunit ␤2, and a postglutamyl
peptide hydrolyzing (pgph) or caspase-like activity in the ␤1
subunit.2 of these, the cht-l activity has been shown to be the
rate-limiting step of proteolysis in vitro and in vivo.3 two major
isoforms of the  xxxg1859xxx   xxxg1860xxx   xxxg1861xxx   xxxg1863xxx   xxxg1864xxx  have been described, including the
constitutive  xxxg1859xxx   xxxg1860xxx   xxxg1861xxx   xxxg1863xxx   xxxg1864xxx , which is present in most cells, and the
immunoproteasome, which in place of the above subunits incorporates 3 related proteins, ␤1i, ␤2i, and ␤5i. the immunoproteasome
is predominantly expressed in cells of lymphoid origin and plays a
role in major histocompatibility complex class i antigen presentation and other constitutive proteolytic activities.3-5
bortezomib (velcade)6 is the first  xxxg1859xxx   xxxg1860xxx   xxxg1861xxx   xxxg1863xxx   xxxg1864xxx  inhibitor to
enter clinical practice for the treatment of relapsed/refractory
multiple myeloma (mm), based in part on pioneering preclinical
studies.7 phase i-iii trials showed bortezomib had impressive
antimyeloma activity,8-10 and additional studies are ongoing to
define its role in that disease and other hematologic malignancies
such as non-hodgkin lymphoma (nhl).11,12 however, the overall
response rate from the phase iii experience was 43%,10 and

bortezomib resistance is emerging as well, underscoring the need
for a next generation of  xxxg1859xxx   xxxg1860xxx   xxxg1861xxx   xxxg1863xxx   xxxg1864xxx  inhibitors with greater efficacy.
one such inhibitor is npi-0052, or salinosporamide a, a compound
related to lactacystin that showed antitumor activity predominantly
through  xxxg342xxx  activation.13 because lactacystin binds to several
 xxxg1859xxx   xxxg1860xxx   xxxg1861xxx   xxxg1863xxx   xxxg1864xxx  subunits, however, and may inhibit other cellular
proteases,14 this class of agents may be less specific. in contrast,
epoxomicin is a natural product isolated from an actinomycetes15
that forms an irreversible, selective, and highly specific morpholino
adduct only with the n-terminal threonine of the ␤5 subunit.16
because the activity of this class of inhibitors against mm has not
been well studied, it was of interest to evaluate the effects of
 xxxd441xxx  (formerly  xxxd441xxx ; proteolix), an epoxyketone related
to epoxomicin (figure 1a).
in the current work, we demonstrate that  xxxd441xxx  inhibited the cht-l activity of the  xxxg1859xxx   xxxg1860xxx   xxxg1861xxx   xxxg1863xxx   xxxg1864xxx  both in vitro and in
cellulo in models of mm. experiments modeling the anticipated
in vivo pharmacokinetics of drug exposure showed that  xxxd441xxx  inhibited proliferation in a variety of cell lines and
patient-derived neoplastic cells, including mm, and induced
intrinsic and extrinsic apoptotic signaling pathways and activation of c-jun-n-terminal kinase (jnk). furthermore,  xxxd441xxx  showed enhanced anti-mm activity compared with
bortezomib, overcame resistance to bortezomib and other agents,
and acted synergistically with dexamethasone (dex). taken

together, these data indicate that  xxxd441xxx  is a promising
 xxxg1859xxx   xxxg1860xxx   xxxg1861xxx   xxxg1863xxx   xxxg1864xxx  inhibitor with activity against mm, providing a
rational basis for its translation into the clinic.

materials and methods
the  xxxg1859xxx   xxxg1860xxx   xxxg1861xxx   xxxg1863xxx   xxxg1864xxx  inhibitor bortezomib was obtained from the university of
north carolina at chapel hill pharmacy, and  xxxd441xxx  was provided by
proteolix, inc. stock solutions were prepared in  xxxd1896xxx 
(dmso) and used as indicated, with a final vehicle concentration that did
not exceed 0.5% (vol/vol). all chemicals, unless otherwise indicated, were
from fisher scientific (pittsburgh, pa).
cell models, cell culture, and experimental conditions
rpmi 8226, u266, anbl-6, kas-6/1, h-929, 8226.dox40, 8226.lr5,
mm1.s, mm1.r, bortezomib-resistant (br) cells, and patient-derived
cells were cultured in rpmi 1640 (invitrogen, carlsbad, ca) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (sigma; st louis, mo), 100 u/ml
penicillin, and 100 ␮g/ml streptomycin (tissue culture facility,
university of north carolina), and maintained in 5% co2 at 37°c.
interleukin (il)-6-dependent cells and purified plasma cells from

patients were supplemented with an additional 1 ng/ml of il-6 (r&d
systems, minneapolis, mn).
patient samples were collected under a protocol approved by the
institutional review board of the university of north carolina. informed
consent was obtained in accordance with the declaration of helsinki.
mononuclear cells from bone marrow aspirates or peripheral blood samples
were isolated by density gradient centrifugation over  xxxd3253xxx -paque plus
(amersham biosciences, piscataway, nj). malignant cells were then
isolated by immunomagnetic bead positive selection in a midi macs ls
column following the manufacturer’s protocol (miltenyi biotec, auburn,
ca). the purity of mm cells was confirmed by flow cytometric analysis
using phycoerythrin-conjugated anti- xxxg2036xxx  antibody (miltenyi biotec).
cells in culture were exposed to  xxxg1859xxx   xxxg1860xxx   xxxg1861xxx   xxxg1863xxx   xxxg1864xxx  inhibitors in either a
continuous fashion or a discontinuous one designed to mimic the known
pharmacokinetics of bortezomib in vivo, which is rapidly cleared from the
circulation with a t1/2␣ of 0.22 to 0.46 hour.17 in the latter,  xxxg1859xxx   xxxg1860xxx   xxxg1861xxx   xxxg1863xxx   xxxg1864xxx 
inhibitors were added for 1 hour, after which cultures were washed once
with phosphate-buffered saline (pbs) and resuspended in drug-free media.

enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for subunit profiling of
 xxxd441xxx 
anbl-6 cells (2 ⫻ 106/well) were plated in 96-well plates and treated with
 xxxd441xxx  doses from 0.001 to 10 ␮m for 1 hour. cells were then lysed
(20 mm tris-hcl, 0.5 mm edta), and cleared lysates were transferred to
polymerase chain reaction (pcr) plates. a standard curve was generated
using untreated anbl-6 cell lysates starting at a concentration of 6 ␮g
protein/␮l. the active site probe [biotin-(ch2)4-leu-leu-leu-epoxyketone; 20 ␮m] was added and incubated at room temperature for 1 hour.
cell lysates were then denatured by adding 1% sodium  xxxd3215xxx 
(sds) and heating to 100°c, followed by mixing with 20 ␮l per well
streptavidin-sepharose high-performance beads (ge healthcare, chalfont
st. giles, united kingdom) in a 96-well multiscreen dv plate (millipore,
billerica, ma) and incubated for 1 hour. these beads were then washed
with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (elisa) buffer (pbs, 1%
bovine  xxxg124xxx , and 0.1% tween-20), and incubated overnight at
4°c on a plate shaker with antibodies to  xxxg1859xxx   xxxg1860xxx   xxxg1861xxx   xxxg1863xxx   xxxg1864xxx  subunits. antibodies
used included mouse monoclonal anti-␤1, anti-␤2, anti-␤1i, and anti-␤5i
(biomol, plymouth meeting, pa), goat polyclonal anti-␤2i (santa cruz
biotechnology, santa cruz, ca), and rabbit polyclonal anti-␤5 (affinitypurified antiserum against klh-cwirvssdnvadlhdkys peptide).
the beads were washed and incubated for 2 hours with horseradish
peroxidase-conjugated secondary goat antirabbit, goat antimouse (biosource, camarillo, ca), or rabbit antigoat (invitrogen) antibodies. after
washing, the beads were developed using the supersignal elisa picochemiluminescence substrate (pierce, rockford, il). luminescent detection was
performed on the tecan genius pro (mannedorf, zurich, switzerland). raw
luminescence was converted to ␮g/ml by comparison with the standard
curve and expressed as the % inhibition relative to vehicle control. curve
fits were generated using the following nonsigmoidal dose-response
equation: y ⫽ bottom ⫹ (top-bottom)/(1 ⫹ 10ˆ((logec50 ⫺ x) ⫻ hillslope)), where x is the logarithm of concentration, y is the % inhibition,
and ec50 is the dose showing 50% effect.
competitive binding for subunit profiling of  xxxd441xxx 
the protocol used to determine  xxxd441xxx  subunit specificity via competitive binding was adapted from berkers et al.19 briefly, anbl-6 cells were
preincubated with increasing  xxxd441xxx  doses at 37°c, followed by
addition of the hapten-labeled cell-permeant vinyl sulfone (vs)  xxxg1859xxx   xxxg1860xxx   xxxg1861xxx   xxxg1863xxx   xxxg1864xxx 
inhibitor vs-l3-ahx3-danysl. western blots were then prepared as detailed
in the next section and probed with polyclonal antidansyl antibodies
(invitrogen).
cell extract preparation and western blotting
whole-cell extracts (wces) were prepared and separated by denaturing gel
electrophoresis as described.20 the antibodies used for immunoblotting
included anti–actin, anti-jnk, anti-ubiquitin, and rat secondary antibodies
(santa cruz biotechnology), anti-bax, anti-p-jnk (thr138/tyr185), and
anti–poly( xxxd80xxx  [adp]-ribose) polymerase (parp) (emd
biosciences, san diego, ca), anti-hsc-70 and anti–second mitochondrial
activator of caspases (smac) antibodies (stressgen, san diego, ca),
anti–mouse secondary (amersham biosciences), anti-rabbit secondary
(bio-rad, hercules, ca), anti– xxxg569xxx  (biovision, mountain view,
ca), and anti-cox ii (invitrogen).
cell proliferation assay
wst-1 (roche diagnostics, indianapolis, in) was used to determine the
effects of  xxxg1859xxx   xxxg1860xxx   xxxg1861xxx   xxxg1863xxx   xxxg1864xxx  inhibitors on cell proliferation according to the
manufacturer’s protocol. the inhibition of proliferation was calculated in
relation to parallel control cells that received vehicle alone and tabulated in
kaleidagraph 3.0.1 (synergy software, reading, pa) or excel 2000
(microsoft, redmond, wa). a linear spline function was used to interpolate
the median inhibitory concentration (ic50) using xlfit 4 software (id
business solutions, guildford, united kingdom). the degree of resistance
(dor) was calculated using the formula: dor ⫽ ic50(resistant cells)/
ic50(sensitive cells).

apoptotic dna fragmentation assay
for apoptosis experiments, cells were seeded onto 96-well plates, treated
with a 1-hour pulse of 300 nm (rpmi 8226, anbl-6) or 100 nm
 xxxd441xxx  (kas-6/1, u266), and allowed to recover for 24 hours before
analysis with the cell death detection elisaplus kit (roche diagnostics)
according to the manufacturer’s specifications. the fold increase in dna
fragmentation is presented as the mean relative to vehicle-treated control
cells.
mitochondrial membrane potential (⌬⌿m)
anbl-6 cells pulsed with 100 nm  xxxd441xxx  were washed and suspended
in pbs containing 5 ␮g/ml of jc-1 (invitrogen), which exhibits potentialdependent accumulation in mitochondria. analysis of the mitochondrial
membrane potential-dependent color shift from 525 to 590 nm was carried
out on a facscan (becton dickinson, franklin lakes, nj), and the data
were analyzed with cellquest software (becton dickinson).
caspase activation assay
cellular lysates were incubated in tris-hcl with 40-␮m fluorogenic
substrates (biomol) specific for caspase-3,  xxxg342xxx , or caspase-9. measurement of free 7-amido-4-methylcoumarin (amc) groups was performed at
380/460 nm on a multilabel fluostar optima (bmg labtech, durham,
nc). results were expressed as fold activation over the vehicle control
from experiments performed in triplicate.
infection with recombinant adenovirus
recombinant adenoviruses carrying the dominant-negative (dn) c-jun
(tam67 mutant) were from vector biolabs (philadelphia, pa). anbl-6
cells were incubated in medium containing the adenovirus carrying
dn-c-jun or an empty cytomegalovirus (cmv) promoter at a multiplicity
of infection of 1000 for 24 hours at 37°c.
apoptosis detection with  xxxg166xxx  and to-pro-3
staining of cells by  xxxg166xxx  was performed according to the manufacturer’s specifications (biovision), and to-pro-3 was used to identify
necrotic or late-stage apoptosis. data were collected using cellquest
software on a facscalibur (becton dickinson), and 10,000 events were
analyzed with flowjo version 6.3.3 (tree star, ashland, or). results are
expressed as percentage specific apoptosis and were calculated using the
following formula: [(% apoptotic cells in experimental ⫺ % apoptotic cells
in control)/(100 ⫺ % apoptotic cells in control) ⫻ 100].

results
impact of  xxxd441xxx  on the constitutive and
immunoproteasome

 xxxd441xxx  is a tetrapeptide epoxyketone related to epoxomicin
(figure 1a), the latter of which shows high specificity in vitro
for the cht-l  xxxg1859xxx   xxxg1860xxx   xxxg1861xxx   xxxg1863xxx   xxxg1864xxx  activity. to evaluate the proteasomal
inhibitory potential of  xxxd441xxx  in mm, extracts from anbl-6
cells were exposed to increasing concentrations of  xxxd441xxx 
(figure 1b) and assayed for 20s catalytic activities.  xxxd441xxx 
displayed preferential in vitro inhibitory potency against the
cht-l activity in the ␤5 subunit, with over 80% inhibition at
doses of 10 nm and above (figure 1b) and little or no effect on
the pgph and t-l activities at doses up to 100 nm. it has been
reported that binding of  xxxg1859xxx   xxxg1860xxx   xxxg1861xxx   xxxg1863xxx   xxxg1864xxx  inhibitors can differ in vitro
and in live cells (in cellulo),19 so it was of interest to determine
whether  xxxd441xxx  interacted with other catalytic subunits in
cellulo using an elisa designed to identify subunit binding.
this assay demonstrated that short exposure to low-dose

figure 2. inhibition of proliferation and induction of apoptosis by  xxxd441xxx . (a,c) il-6–independent rpmi 8226 and il-6–dependent anbl-6 mm cells (2 ⫻ 104) were
treated continuously (a) or pulsed for 1 hour (c) with increasing concentrations of  xxxd441xxx . cellular viability was determined at 24 hours using the water-soluble tetrazolium
salt wst-1. (b,d) il-6–dependent (anbl-6, kas-6/1) and il-6–independent (rpmi 8226, u266) myeloma cells were continuously exposed (b) or pulsed (d) with  xxxd441xxx 
for 1 hour and allowed to recover for 24 hours. programmed cell death was then evaluated using a dna fragmentation elisa. results are expressed as a fold-increase of dna
fragmentation over dmso control, and error bars are sd.

 xxxd441xxx  led to preferential binding specificity for the ␤5
constitutive 20s  xxxg1859xxx   xxxg1860xxx   xxxg1861xxx   xxxg1863xxx   xxxg1864xxx  and the ␤5i immunoproteasome
subunits (figure 1c). however, at very high concentrations over
1 ␮m,  xxxd441xxx  did interact with the ␤1 and ␤2 subunits as
well as ␤1i and ␤2i. to confirm the subunit specificity of
 xxxd441xxx  in another assay, a competitive binding technique
was performed with a dansyl-linked peptide vs inhibitor
(vs-l3-ahx3-dansyl), which binds to free catalytic subunits
and can be detected by western blotting.19 extended exposure to
 xxxd441xxx  for 5 hours saturated the ␤5 and ␤5i active sites in a
dose-dependent manner and also led to increased binding to the
␤1, ␤1i, ␤2, and ␤2i subunits, with maximal binding observed at
50 nm (figure 1d). to mimic the in vivo pharmacokinetics of
 xxxg1859xxx   xxxg1860xxx   xxxg1861xxx   xxxg1863xxx   xxxg1864xxx  inhibitor treatment, rpmi 8226 cells were pulsed
with  xxxd441xxx  for 1 hour, and then allowed to recover in
drug-free media. accumulation of ubiquitin-conjugated proteins
was observed up to 48 hours after recovery from the pulse
(figure 1e). in addition, the accumulation of proapoptotic bax,
a  xxxg1859xxx   xxxg1860xxx   xxxg1861xxx   xxxg1863xxx   xxxg1864xxx  target,21 was also observed at 24 and 48 hours after
treatment, signifying a potent and durable  xxxg1859xxx   xxxg1860xxx   xxxg1861xxx   xxxg1863xxx   xxxg1864xxx  inhibition
by  xxxd441xxx  (figure 1f).
antiproliferative and proapoptotic impact of  xxxd441xxx 

to determine whether  xxxd441xxx -mediated  xxxg1859xxx   xxxg1860xxx   xxxg1861xxx   xxxg1863xxx   xxxg1864xxx  inhibition
impacted proliferation, its effect in il-6–independent (rpmi 8226,
u266) and il-6–dependent (anbl-6, kas-6/1) myeloma cell
lines was tested. a dose-dependent decrease in cell viability was
found in anbl-6 and rpmi 8226 cells (figure 2a), and u266 and
kas-6/1 cells (data not shown), treated continuously with  xxxd441xxx  for 24 hours, with an ic50 less than 5 nm in both after
24 hours. this effect was further enhanced at 48 and 72 hours (data
not shown). to determine whether the observed viability changes
were caused by induction of apoptosis, mm cell lines were treated
continuously with  xxxd441xxx  at 5 nm (u266, kas-6/1) or 10 nm
(rpmi 8226, anbl-6). an apoptosis-specific dna fragmentation
elisa revealed that low-dose  xxxd441xxx  induced apoptosis in all
cell lines to varying degrees (figure 2b).

pulse treatment for 1 hour with  xxxd441xxx  followed by
exposure to drug-free medium also induced a dose-dependent
inhibition of proliferation, though higher drug concentrations were
necessary (figure 2c). this activity was associated with dna
fragmentation (figure 2d), and enhanced levels of programmed
cell death were also detected by staining with  xxxg166xxx , which
showed a 2.5-fold increase after a 1-hour pulse with 100 nm
 xxxd441xxx  in anbl-6 cells (data not shown).
mechanisms of  xxxd441xxx -induced apoptosis

initiation of apoptosis can occur through an intrinsic pathway
involving  xxxg569xxx  release and caspase-9 activation or an
extrinsic pathway mediated by activation of fas/caspase-8dependent signaling, which then converge on a common effector, caspase-3.22 bortezomib-induced apoptosis activates both
pathways,23 and we therefore examined whether  xxxd441xxx  had
similar proapoptotic effects. measurement of caspase activity in
anbl-6 cells pulsed with  xxxd441xxx  revealed substantial
increases in  xxxg342xxx , caspase-9, and caspase-3 activity after 8
hours, giving a 3.2-, 3.9- and 6.9-fold increase, respectively,
over control cells after 8 hours (figure 3a). caspase-9 and
caspase-3 activities continued to increase up to 24 hours later,
though no discernible increase in  xxxg342xxx  activity was found
beyond 8 hours. to confirm that caspase activation was necessary
for  xxxd441xxx -induced cell death, anbl-6 cells were treated with
caspase inhibitors, followed by a brief pulse of  xxxd441xxx  (figure
3b). inhibition of caspase-3,  xxxg342xxx , and caspase-9 rescued
95%, 76%, and 94% of anbl-6 cells, respectively (figure 3b)
from  xxxd441xxx -mediated growth inhibition. these data indicated
that  xxxd441xxx -induced apoptosis occurred through both intrinsic
and extrinsic caspase pathways.
a major characteristic of intrinsic caspase-stimulated apoptosis is the loss of mitochondrial transmembrane potential (⌬⌿m)
and release of proapoptotic proteins, including  xxxg569xxx 
and smac/diablo.24,25 to examine whether carfilzomibmediated apoptosis led to mitochondrial membrane depolarization, anbl-6 cells were pulsed with 100 nm  xxxd441xxx  and

and allowed to recover for 8 or 24 hours. cellular lysates (30 ␮g per reaction) were incubated with 40-␮m fluorogenic substrates specific for caspase-3,  xxxg342xxx , and
caspase-9. results are expressed as fold relative fluorescence units over dmso control. (b) anbl-6 (2 ⫻ 104 cells per reaction) were pretreated for 20 hours with caspase-3
(c-3)-,  xxxg342xxx  (c-8)-, and caspase-9 (c-9)-specific inhibitors, a negative control (neg), a pan-caspase inhibitor (pan), or no inhibitor (⫺), followed by a 1-hour pulse with
100 nm  xxxd441xxx . fresh media containing caspase inhibitors were then added, and cellular proliferation was determined after a 24-hour recovery period. data were
expressed as percent inhibition compared with vehicle (dmso) controls. (c)  xxxd441xxx  induces depolarization of mitochondria. the fluorescent shift of the jc-1 cationic dye
from cytosol (green fluorescence) to mitochondria (red fluorescence) in live cells was analyzed by flow cytometry in anbl-6 cells pulsed with 100 nm  xxxd441xxx  (q1:
red fluorescence; q2: red and green fluorescence; q3: green fluorescence). (d) anbl-6 cells treated for 1 hour with 100 nm  xxxd441xxx  were subjected to centrifugal
cellular fractionation into the cytosolic fraction and hmf that included mitochondria. release of  xxxg569xxx  and smac from the mitochondria was assessed by
western blot. cox ii, an intramitochondrial protein, was used as a control. wces were monitored as a control for protein expression. (e) western blot analysis for the
phosphorylation of jnk (ie, activated jnk) and cleavage of parp in rpmi 8226 cells, which were pulsed with 100 nm  xxxd441xxx  and allowed to recover for the
indicated time periods. hsc-70 was used as a loading control. to determine whether abrogation of jnk signaling through c-jun affects  xxxd441xxx ’s antiproliferative and
proapoptotic action, anbl-6 cells (2 ⫻ 104 per well) were infected with dn-c-jun adenovirus for 24 hours, followed by addition of 100 nm pulse with  xxxd441xxx .
(f) cellular growth was assessed using the wst-1 reagent. (g) apoptosis was measured by dna fragment production. error bars for panels a, b, f, and g are sd.

stained with the cationic dye, jc-1, and the polarity of the
mitochondrial membrane was assessed by flow cytometry. jc-1
undergoes a shift from green to red fluorescence in nonapoptotic
cells. in  xxxd441xxx  pulse-treated cells, the mitochondrial
membrane integrity was decreased to 41% (q1 ⫹ q2), compared with 75% in vehicle-treated control cells (figure 3c).
similar results were obtained in rpmi 8226 cells analyzed by
fluorescent microscopy for ⌬⌿m (data not shown). formation of
the apoptosome, a large multisubunit molecule, requires the
release of  xxxg569xxx  from mitochondria and the inclusion of
both  xxxg569xxx  and caspase-9 to signal to the effector
caspase-3.26 cellular fractionation for the cytosolic component
and heavy membrane fraction (hmf), including intact and
disrupted mitochondria, revealed that a brief pulse with  xxxd441xxx  led to cytosolic accumulation of  xxxg569xxx  and
smac and a concomitant decrease of these proteins in the hmf
(figure 3d).

proapoptotic signaling through jnk and its downstream targets,
including c-jun, plays an important role in cell death due to other
 xxxg1859xxx   xxxg1860xxx   xxxg1861xxx   xxxg1863xxx   xxxg1864xxx  inhibitors.27-29 to determine whether jnk activation is
important in mediating  xxxd441xxx -induced apoptosis, rpmi 8226 cells
were exposed to a pulse of  xxxd441xxx , and jnk activation status was
determined. indeed, brief pulses with  xxxd441xxx  led to a significant
increase in activated jnk, lasting up to 48 hours (figure 3e). in
addition, cleavage of parp, a late-stage apoptotic event, correlated well
with jnk activity levels. to study whether c-jun phosphorylation by
activated jnk is important in the apoptotic signaling cascade induced by
 xxxd441xxx , anbl-6 cells were infected with a dn-c-jun adenovirus,
after which the antiproliferative function of  xxxd441xxx  was assessed.
disruption of c-jun activation led to nearly complete inhibition of the
antiproliferative activity of  xxxd441xxx  (figure 3f). similarly, dn-c-jun
suppressed  xxxd441xxx -induced apoptosis in pulse-treated anbl-6
cells, as measured by a 2-fold decrease in caspase-3 activity (figure 3g).

indicated time points is shown. protein expression levels of activated jnk were
examined after treatment with  xxxd441xxx  or bortezomib. (c) anbl-6 cells were
exposed to a 1-hour pulse of 100 nm  xxxd441xxx  or bortezomib and allowed to
recover for 8 hours. cellular lysates (30 ␮g per reaction) were then incubated with
40-␮m fluorogenic substrates specific for caspase-3,  xxxg342xxx , and caspase-9
activity. results are expressed as fold relative fluorescence units over dmso control
and determined as described in figure 1. error bars for panels a and c are sd.

effects of  xxxd441xxx  and bortezomib in mm cell lines

bortezomib is approved for the treatment of relapsed/refractory
mm patients, where it has been shown to improve survival, even
in patients with poor-risk disease, such as those with chromosome 13 deletion.10,30 the efficacy of pulse  xxxd441xxx  and
bortezomib treatment was therefore compared in cell line
models of mm (figure 4). first, we evaluated the viability of
both il-6–dependent and –independent cell lines pulse-treated
with increasing doses of  xxxg1859xxx   xxxg1860xxx   xxxg1861xxx   xxxg1863xxx   xxxg1864xxx  inhibitor and allowed to
recover for 24 hours. statistically significant (p ⬍ .05) decreases in the viable cell population treated with  xxxd441xxx 
were observed in anbl-6, kas-6/1,  xxxd2629xxx , and rpmi 8226
cells compared with their bortezomib-treated counterparts,
indicating an overall trend toward increased sensitivity in
myeloma cell lines to  xxxd441xxx  (figure 4a). furthermore,
jnk phosphorylation was enhanced with  xxxd441xxx  treatment
compared with bortezomib (figure 4b). comparisons of caspase
activity levels also indicated that  xxxd441xxx  was more potent
than bortezomib in increasing caspase-3,  xxxg342xxx , and caspase-9
activity and did so by 1.5-, 1.8-, and 2.0-fold more, respectively,
compared with bortezomib (figure 4c).
 xxxd441xxx  effects in patient-derived samples

based on the results obtained from mm cell culture models, it was
of interest to evaluate the activity of  xxxd441xxx  in purified
 xxxg2036xxx ⫹ plasma cells derived from patients. exposure of such cells
to escalating doses of  xxxd441xxx  for 24 hours continuously,
followed by measurement of the cht-l activity, revealed that

blood, 1 november 2007 䡠 volume 110, number 9

 xxxd441xxx  induced a dose-dependent  xxxg1859xxx   xxxg1860xxx   xxxg1861xxx   xxxg1863xxx   xxxg1864xxx  inhibition (figure 5a). similarly, cellular viability decreased significantly in such
plasma cells treated continuously with  xxxd441xxx  (figure 5b). we
then examined whether a brief pulse of  xxxd441xxx  had greater
antiproliferative effects compared with a similar pulse of bortezomib. plasma cells from either bone marrow aspirates or
peripheral blood of patients, some with chromosome 13 deletions,
were pulsed with 100 nm  xxxd441xxx  or bortezomib.  xxxd441xxx 
inhibited proliferation to a greater extent than bortezomib by 11%
to 70% in 8 of 9 samples from patients who were clinically
bortezomib-naive (figure 5c). however, bortezomib did display
increased antiproliferative efficacy in one sample compared with
 xxxd441xxx  (figure 5c). it is important to note that all experiments
were performed in purified  xxxg2036xxx ⫹ plasma cells, and the effect of
 xxxd441xxx  on other clonal subsets of cells is currently unknown.
in addition to activity against mm, bortezomib is clinically
active against other hematologic malignancies, so we also sought to
examine the impact of  xxxd441xxx  in other models.  xxxd441xxx 
inhibited proliferation and induced apoptosis in purified samples
from patients with diffuse large b-cell nhl (figure 5d), chronic
lymphocytic leukemia (cll; figure 5e), and acute myeloid
leukemia (aml; figure 5f). inhibition of the cht-l activity was
confirmed in purified  xxxg375xxx ⫹ cells from a patient with b-cell cll
(data not shown), and this cht-l inhibition correlated well with
induction of apoptosis in  xxxd441xxx  pulse-treated cells (figure
5e). relative to bortezomib,  xxxd441xxx  appeared to show enhanced activity against all of these samples (figure 5d-f).
 xxxd441xxx  and drug resistance

the potent activity of  xxxd441xxx  led us to evaluate the possibility
that it could overcome bortezomib resistance. resistant (br) cell
lines were prepared by exposing wild-type (wt) cells to increasing
dosages of bortezomib over several months until discernible
changes in bortezomib sensitivity were observed. resistant cell
lines displayed significant decreases in their sensitivity to the
antiproliferative effects of bortezomib treatment. for example,
anbl-6.wt cells exposed continuously to 5 nm bortezomib for 24
hours experienced a 78% decrease in the viable cell population,
compared with anbl-6.br cells, where only a 7% loss of viability
was seen, indicating a 4-fold loss of bortezomib sensitivity
(additional results are shown in figure  xxxd3227xxx , available on the blood
website; see the supplemental materials link at the top of the online
article). similar results were found in comparisons of rpmi
8226.br and opm-2.br cells with their wt parentals. anbl-6.wt
and br cells were then pulse-treated with comparable concentrations of  xxxd441xxx  or bortezomib, and the antiproliferative effects
were assessed after 24 hours. resistance to bortezomib did result in
some cross-resistance with  xxxd441xxx , because br cells were less
sensitive than wt cells to this irreversible inhibitor (figure 6a).
however,  xxxd441xxx  was more potent at inhibiting proliferation in
br cell lines than bortezomib, with anbl-6.br (figure 6a),
rpmi 8226.br (figure s1b), and opm-2.br (figure s1c) cells
exhibiting a 2.0-, 1.5-, and 2.1-fold increased sensitivity to
 xxxd441xxx , respectively. similarly, in  xxxg2036xxx ⫹ plasma cells from a
patient who had no clinical benefit after bortezomib therapy,
 xxxd441xxx  retained the ability to inhibit proliferation (figure 6b).
exposure of plasma cells from 2 patients who both clinically
progressed while on bortezomib to  xxxd441xxx  showed enhanced
cytotoxic effects compared with treatment with bortezomib (figure
6c,d).
the ability of  xxxd441xxx  to overcome resistance to other
antimyeloma agents was examined in  xxxd2562xxx -, dex-, and

positive result indicating the amount of enhanced antiproliferative activity of  xxxd441xxx  over that of bortezomib. (d) pulse  xxxd441xxx  and bortezomib exposure in an nhl

was assessed in cells stained with  xxxg166xxx /to-pro-3/anti- xxxg375xxx . specific apoptosis is shown in the  xxxg375xxx ⫹ gated population relative to vehicle controls. (f) aml cells from a
patient with progressive disease after multiple chemotherapeutic treatments were pulsed for 1 hour with 100 nm  xxxd441xxx  or bortezomib or continuously treated with 1 ␮m
dox. apoptosis was measured by dna fragmentation elisa and expressed as fold induction over dmso control in  xxxg382xxx ⫹cells purified from peripheral blood mononuclear
cells (pbmcs). error bars in panels a,b,c,d, and f are sd.

doxorubicin (dox)-resistant cell lines (table 1).  xxxd441xxx  overcame dex resistance, in that mm1.r cells revealed an ic50 of
15.2 nm, which, interestingly, was less than the value of 29.3 nm
for parental mm1.s cells. resistance to  xxxd2562xxx  also did not
impact  xxxd441xxx , because the ic50 in rpmi 8226.wt cells was
comparable with that in  xxxd2562xxx -resistant 8226.lr5 cells. in
contrast, dox-resistant 8226.dox40 cells did not respond to
 xxxd441xxx , as there was minimal proliferation inhibition at
concentrations up to 1000 nm (figure s1d). however, pretreatment with the p-glycoprotein inhibitor verapamil partially overcame this resistance (table 1), supporting the possibility that
 xxxd441xxx  may be subject to p-glycoprotein–mediated drug
resistance.
antimyeloma agents are often used in combinations to enhance
their antitumor activity, and addition of dex to bortezomib is one
strategy that has shown improved efficacy.31 to determine whether
 xxxd441xxx  works in concert with dex, kas-6/1 and rpmi 8226
cells were treated simultaneously with both drugs for 24 or
48 hours, respectively. compared with dex or  xxxd441xxx  alone,
the combination demonstrated a greater antiproliferative effect
(figure 6f). moreover, statistical analysis indicated that a high
degree of synergy was present between the 2 drugs at all
concentrations tested in both cell lines (tables 2,3).

discussion
the reversible  xxxg1859xxx   xxxg1860xxx   xxxg1861xxx   xxxg1863xxx   xxxg1864xxx  inhibitor bortezomib represents an
important advance in the treatment of mm, where it has become
one standard of care for relapsed/refractory disease and is under
active investigation as a front-line agent. combination regimens

based on bortezomib may have further enhanced activity,
including regimens such as bortezomib with dox.32-35 such
findings have validated the ubiquitin- xxxg1859xxx   xxxg1860xxx   xxxg1861xxx   xxxg1863xxx   xxxg1864xxx  pathway as
both a target by itself for cancer therapy and a rational target to
induce chemosensitization and overcome chemoresistance to
conventional agents. despite these encouraging data, some
patients have disease that shows primary resistance and does not
respond to bortezomib therapy. others develop secondary
resistance, progress after an initial response, or do not respond
when they are rechallenged after relapsing from an earlier
response to bortezomib. another  xxxg1859xxx   xxxg1860xxx   xxxg1861xxx   xxxg1863xxx   xxxg1864xxx  inhibitor, npi0052, has already been described that can overcome previous
bortezomib resistance,13 and its irreversible mechanism of
inhibition suggested that other inhibitors that block  xxxg1859xxx   xxxg1860xxx   xxxg1861xxx   xxxg1863xxx   xxxg1864xxx 
function irreversibly merited study as well. this led us to
evaluate the properties of the epoxomicin-related tetrapeptide
 xxxd441xxx  and to determine its potential as an antimyeloma
agent.
 xxxd441xxx  shares structural similarity with epoxomicin. cocrystal
studies revealed that epoxomicin formed a unique 6-atom ring structure
with the ␤5 subunit, arising from a 2-step process that ultimately led to
intramolecular cyclization and morpholino adduction.36 it is a likely
assumption that  xxxd441xxx ’s interaction with the  xxxg1859xxx   xxxg1860xxx   xxxg1861xxx   xxxg1863xxx   xxxg1864xxx  is similar
in nature, given the identical keto-epoxide pharmacophore.  xxxd441xxx 
was found to specifically target the cht-l  xxxg1859xxx   xxxg1860xxx   xxxg1861xxx   xxxg1863xxx   xxxg1864xxx  activity (figure
1b) by binding potently and specifically to the ␤5 constitutive  xxxg1859xxx   xxxg1860xxx   xxxg1861xxx   xxxg1863xxx   xxxg1864xxx  and ␤5i immunoproteasome subunits (figure 1c). this resulted in
accumulation of ubiquitin-protein conjugates (figure 1d) and  xxxg1859xxx   xxxg1860xxx   xxxg1861xxx   xxxg1863xxx   xxxg1864xxx  substrates (figure 1e), as well as inhibition of myeloma cell
proliferation (figure 2a-c) through induction of programmed cell death
(figure 2b-d). the molecular sequelae of  xxxd441xxx  are similar to

those of bortezomib, in that activation of both the intrinsic and
extrinsic apoptotic pathways was seen, and these converged on
the common effector caspase-3 (figure 3a). caspase inhibitors
dramatically blocked  xxxd441xxx -stimulated apoptosis, similar
to bortezomib-induced apoptosis (figure 3b).23 jnk activation
is well characterized in bortezomib-induced apoptosis,37 and we
found a similarly marked increase in jnk activity with  xxxd441xxx  exposure (figure 3e). abrogation of jnk apoptotic
signaling cascades with a dn-c-jun construct correlated with a
decrease in  xxxd441xxx -induced apoptosis (figure 3g). lauricella et al had identical findings with bortezomib treatment in
hepatoma cells.27
interestingly, npi-0052 activated apoptosis predominantly
through a  xxxg342xxx -mediated pathway, with little dependence
on caspase-9.13 bortezomib preferentially inhibits cht-l activity, as does  xxxd441xxx , whereas npi-0052 inhibits the cht-l
and the pgph and t-l proteases. these findings suggest that
 xxxg1859xxx   xxxg1860xxx   xxxg1861xxx   xxxg1863xxx   xxxg1864xxx  inhibitors targeting predominantly the ␤5 and/or ␤5i

subunits may trigger dual extrinsic and intrinsic apoptosis
pathway activation irrespective of their chemical composition or
their ability to form either reversible or irreversible bonds with
the active-site threonine. the predominant reliance of npi-0052
on  xxxg342xxx  would therefore seem to be partly related to the
interaction of the  xxxg1859xxx   xxxg1860xxx   xxxg1861xxx   xxxg1863xxx   xxxg1864xxx  active sites with the unique
substituents on its bicyclic ring system, which do not induce bax
activation, oligomerization, and mitochondrial insertion. in
further dissecting the activity and mechanism of action of
 xxxg1859xxx   xxxg1860xxx   xxxg1861xxx   xxxg1863xxx   xxxg1864xxx  inhibitors, it would therefore be of interest in the
future to test agents that specifically target only the pgph or the
t-l proteases. in addition, the role of the immunoproteasome in
contributing to the activation of distinct apoptotic pathways has
not been defined as of yet, but all 3 classes of  xxxg1859xxx   xxxg1860xxx   xxxg1861xxx   xxxg1863xxx   xxxg1864xxx 
inhibitors, including bortezomib,  xxxd441xxx , and npi-0052,
have been shown to bind and inhibit immunoproteasomespecific subunits. the use of specific immunoproteasome inhibitors that have been recently identified38 may be of help in

determining the extent of immunoproteasome dependency to
cellular survival.
 xxxg1859xxx   xxxg1860xxx   xxxg1861xxx   xxxg1863xxx   xxxg1864xxx  inhibition with  xxxd441xxx  resulted in potent antiproliferative and proapoptotic effects in myeloma cell lines (figure
2) and in patient-derived models of myeloma (figure 5). the
presence of the deletion of chromosome 13 identifies a poorprognosis subgroup of patients with myeloma who have good
benefits with bortezomib-based therapy.39 several of the cell
lines and patient samples tested herein also harbored this
cytogenetic abnormality and responded well to  xxxd441xxx 
preclinically. this suggests the possibility that  xxxg1859xxx   xxxg1860xxx   xxxg1861xxx   xxxg1863xxx   xxxg1864xxx 
inhibitors as a class may be especially effective in this
population, though larger prospective studies are needed to
verify these findings for bortezomib, and  xxxd441xxx  is just
entering clinical trials.  xxxd441xxx  also showed evidence of
activity against malignant cells from patients with nhl, and
both aml and cll, suggesting other possible areas for future
clinical development. stapnes et al also found that  xxxd441xxx 
potently inhibited proliferation and induced apoptosis in cd34⫹
cells from patients with aml.40
one notable finding is that  xxxd441xxx  was more potent than
bortezomib in  xxxg1859xxx   xxxg1860xxx   xxxg1861xxx   xxxg1863xxx   xxxg1864xxx  inhibitor-naive models (figure 3).
also of importance,  xxxd441xxx  overcame both primary and
secondary resistance to bortezomib in both cell line models and
clinical samples (figure 6). the mechanism by which this
occurs has not yet been elucidated, but previous studies with
npi-0052 suggested that it was this agent’s ability to block
several  xxxg1859xxx   xxxg1860xxx   xxxg1861xxx   xxxg1863xxx   xxxg1864xxx  proteases that allowed it to overcome
bortezomib resistance. because  xxxd441xxx  has a similar property in overcoming resistance, but predominantly binds only the
cht-l subunit, our studies suggest that it may be the irreversibility of agents such as npi-0052 and  xxxd441xxx  that confers this
attractive property. if true, this suggests a possible mechanism,
because one characteristic of cells that express primary resistance to bortezomib is the overexpression of  xxxg1859xxx   xxxg1860xxx   xxxg1861xxx   xxxg1863xxx   xxxg1864xxx 
subunits and other ubiquitin- xxxg1859xxx   xxxg1860xxx   xxxg1861xxx   xxxg1863xxx   xxxg1864xxx  pathway proteins.41-43
it may be that irreversible drugs would require the cell to
synthesize and reassemble new proteasomes to recover their
proteolytic capacity. because this would take longer than
recovery from reversible inhibitors, that in part would occur by
dissociation of bortezomib without the need for new protein
synthesis, irreversible inhibitors would provide a longer-lasting
inhibition. such prolonged inhibition could result in enhanced
efficacy or the ability to overcome the cell’s attempt at
resistance by overproduction of proteasomes. in addition, the
ability of  xxxd441xxx  to overcome bortezomib resistance does
not seem to be linked to cellular transport mechanisms as the
rate of onset of  xxxg1859xxx   xxxg1860xxx   xxxg1861xxx   xxxg1863xxx   xxxg1864xxx  inhibition does not differ greatly in a
variety of cell types exposed to  xxxd441xxx  and bortezomib
(data not shown). however, it is important to note that these

3289

studies were conducted in  xxxg1859xxx   xxxg1860xxx   xxxg1861xxx   xxxg1863xxx   xxxg1864xxx  inhibitor-naive cells.
further studies will be needed to elucidate the contribution of
these possibilities or to determine whether some different
pathway is responsible for the ability to partially overcome
bortezomib resistance. these should be helped by the development of bortezomib-resistant myeloma cell models such as those
described herein, which have not previously been reported.
taken together, the above data provide a strong rationale for
clinical evaluation of the  xxxg1859xxx   xxxg1860xxx   xxxg1861xxx   xxxg1863xxx   xxxg1864xxx  inhibitor  xxxd441xxx  in
patients with relapsed and refractory myeloma. one concern would
be that the irreversible mechanism of action of  xxxd441xxx  could
result in enhanced toxicities of the kind described for bortezomib,
such as cytopenias, gastrointestinal events, constitutional symptoms, and peripheral neuropathy. it certainly is also possible that
this agent’s mechanism of action, and probably different clinical
pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, could result in new,
heretofore uncharacterized dose-limiting toxicities. phase i studies
of  xxxd441xxx  are currently underway using 2 different schedules,
however, and to date no untoward toxicities have been reported,
and antitumor activity is beginning to be seen.44 this agent’s ability
to overcome bortezomib resistance preclinically suggests that it
may provide another therapeutic option for patients whose disease
has progressed through bortezomib or for those who have had
responses of very brief duration. in addition,  xxxd441xxx  in
combination with dex leads to a synergistic antiproliferative effect,
indicating that rationally designed combination regimens may
further improve the therapeutic efficacy of  xxxd441xxx  in the
relapsed/refractory and possibly front-line myeloma settings.
