pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia in a patient with rheumatoid arthritis as
a complication of treatment with infliximab, anti- xxxg2296xxx  a
neutralizing antibody

received: october 19, 2005 / accepted: december 21, 2005

abstract we report that a-63-year-old woman developed
pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia (pcp) as a complication
from treatment with infliximab for rheumatoid arthritis.
although there was neither symptoms of dyspnea nor typical observations on a chest x-ray examination, low levels of
oxygen saturation and findings of high-resolution chest
computed tomographic scanning suggested a possibility of
interstitial pneumonia. a polymerase chain reaction-based
detection of pneumocystis jiroveci in induced sputum allowed an early diagnosis of pcp and subsequent effective
treatment.

blocking agents is reported to dramatically improve the
outcome of ra.1–4 infliximab is a chimeric mouse/human
monoclonal antibody against human  xxxg2296xxx  and etanercept
is a recombinant human tnf receptor p75 dimer attached
to the fc domain of human igg1. both are most commonly
used worldwide as the tnf-blocking agent, and their uses
are approved in japan for ra therapy. a combination of
methotrexate (mtx) and infliximab or etanercept is more
effective compared with each treatment alone in ra
patients.2–4
 xxxg2296xxx  alpha is known to induce expressions
of adhesion molecules and cytokines, both important
mediators of inflammation. further,  xxxg2296xxx  plays a pivotal
role in cellular immunity, suggesting that the inhibition
of  xxxg2296xxx  activities may increase a risk of intracellular
microorganism-induced infectious diseases.5–8 first, an increased risk of tuberculosis, especially extrapulmonary and/
or disseminated types, has been reported in infliximabtreated patients.9 further, serious infections caused by listeria monocytogenes, coccidioides immitis, mycobacterium
avium, and pneumocystis jiroveci (formerly called pneumocystis carinii) have been noticed in patients under tnf
blockade therapy.5–8 thus  xxxg2296xxx  is very likely to be essential
for an elimination of these microorganisms, and the use of
tnf-blocking agents is associated with the increased risk of
opportunistic infection. a rapid detection of these microorganisms is therefore needed to minimize serious infections
in the course of tnf blockade therapy.
more recently, the detection of p. jiroveci using a
polymerase chain reaction (pcr) technique has been established with specimens from induced sputum. this method
may improve the clinical diagnosis of p. jiroveci pneumonia
(pcp).10 since a delay in the diagnosis of pcp increases
the risk of death, sensitive and specific detection of p.
jiroveci is essential (u.s. public health service: consensus
statement on the use of corticosteroids as adjunctive
therapy for pneumocystis pneumonia in the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, http://www.cdc.gov). here we
report the early diagnosis of pcp in an ra patient receiving
infliximab therapy, using the pcr-based detection of
p. jiroveci dna.

case report
a 63-year-old woman who had seropositive, anti-cyclic
citrullinated peptide antibody-positive and hla-dr4positive ra for 8 years was referred to our hospital for a
routine medical check in the course of infliximab treatment.
she had an ongoing active disease in spite of 8 mg/week of
mtx treatment. four weeks prior to referral, she received
a first infusion of infliximab (3 mg/kg) and she had a further
infusion of the same dosage 2 weeks before admission. before the second infusion of infliximab, the therapy for ra
was successful, namely, the disease activity score for 28
joints was decreased from 6.8 to 4.6. the values of serum creactive protein (crp) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate
(esr) were below 0.3 mg/dl and 30 mm/h, respectively.
when she visited our clinic for a routine medical check of
infliximab therapy, the crp value in serum was 2.01 mg/dl,
regardless of a decrease in the number of swollen and tender joints. she revealed no clinical symptoms such as dyspnea, fever, or  xxxd1861xxx , except for slight general fatigue.
a chest x-ray film showed an obscure margin of cardiac
shadow at the left lower lobe, and there was no greater
change compared with that taken before the infliximab
therapy (fig. 1). despite lacking obvious clinical symptoms
and chest x-ray findings, the patient had a low level of
oxygen saturation (91%), and her arterial blood gas measurement on room air yielded ph 7.466, pao2 56.8 mmhg,
and paco2 37.7 mmhg. moreover high-resolution chest
computed tomographic scans (hrcts) demonstrated distant mosaic patterns (fig. 2a,b). serum level of lactate
dehydrogenase (ldh) was elevated (336 iu/l). other hematological and biochemical data were normal.
since in japan p. jiroveci is supposed to be one of the
major causal agents of interstitial pneumonia during
infliximab therapy (postmarketing surveillance [pms] report in japanese by japan college of rheumatology [jcr],
http://www.ryumachi-jp.com), we discontinued mtx treatment and started the oral administration of trimethoprim–
sulfamethoxazole (tmp-smx, 3200 mg of tmp and 640 mg
of smx). to make an early diagnosis of pcp, we performed
pcr for p. jiroveci. template dnas were extracted from
induced sputum and bronchoalveolar lavage (bal)
samples, using an amplicor respiration specimen preparation kit (roche molecular systems, bellville, nj, usa),
and 25 µl of samples were subjected to pcr as templates.
oligonucleotide primers (5′-gat ggc tgt ttc caa
a

gcc ca-3′ and 5′- xxxg889xxx  tac gtt gca aag tag tc3′) were used at 100 pmol in 50 µl of amplification reaction
mixtures, with denaturation at 94°c for 1 min, annealing at
58°c for 1 min, and extension at 72°c for 90 s, for 40 cycles.
amplified products were subjected to electrophoresis on
2% agarose gels. on the day following admission, considerable amounts of dna products with lengths of 376 bp were
amplified from dna isolated from both induced sputum
and bal samples (fig. 3). these data are indicative of the
existence of p. jiroveci in this patient. concerning interstitial pneumonia markers, the serum levels of surfactant
protein-a ( xxxg2060xxx ) and surfactant protein-d ( xxxg2062xxx ), but not
 xxxg1482xxx , were elevated. high-resolution computed tomography findings were consistent with those seen in pcp.11 in
consideration of all these data, we reached the final diagnosis of pcp, and tmp-smx treatments were continued for
this patient. a large amount of beta-d-glucane (123.6 pg/ml), a
composition of fungus cell walls, was detected in patient
serum. this result also supported our diagnosis.
the clinical course is shown in fig. 4. the treatment with
tmp-smx was successful without the use of steroid pulse
therapy and the distant mosaic pattern shown in hrct on
admission was improved (fig. 2c,d). on day 13, the levels
of  xxxg2060xxx ,  xxxg2062xxx , and ldh decreased to within the normal
range, and improvement of oxygenation and normalization
of serum crp levels were seen. serum beta-d-glucane levels
on days 13 and 27 were 240.4 and 109.4 pg/ml, respectively.
on day 3 of the tmp-smx treatment, the oral administration of these agents was changed to drip infusion because of
their adverse effects, such as severe nausea and vomiting.

discussion
pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia has been recognized as a
rare disease occurring in immunocompromised hosts, such
as malignancy and collagen disease patients. in this report,
pcp was present in an ra patient as a complication of the
infliximab therapy. initially, an increased risk of tuberculosis was predicted, since japan is an epidemic area of tuberculosis. on the other hand, data from recent pms for
infliximab in japan indicated a high incidence of pcp. of
4000 ra patients treated with infliximab, 15 cases were
complicated with pcp (pms report in japanese by jcr,
http://www.ryumachi-jp.com). in western countries, pcp is

a relatively uncommon infectious disease associated with
infliximab therapy,12,13 and several cases of pcp during this
therapy have been reported.14–17
pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia is well known to be the
most frequent complication seen in acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (aids) patients.18,19 a decrease in numbers of cd4+ t cells is strongly associated with the risk of
developing pcp in full-blown hiv patients. ninety percent
of episodes occurred at total counts of less than 200/µl cd4+
t cells, suggesting that t cells play critical roles in suppressing pcp development. however, infliximab-treated patients do not exhibit a low number of circulating cd4+ t
cells.20 in our case, no severe decrease in lymphocyte count
was observed. the decreased number of cd4+ t cells might
not be involved in the development of pcp in infliximabtreated patients.
a blocking of the  xxxg2296xxx  function may provoke pcp. it
has been proposed that  xxxg2296xxx  and interferon-gamma (ifngamma) play
essential roles in the elimination of p. jiroveci through
reactive nitrogen intermediates.21 pneumocystis jiroveci
stimulates alveolar macrophages to produce  xxxg2296xxx , which
mediates the ifngamma-dependent generation of reactive nitrogen intermediates. further, an involvement of the tnfalphadependent expression of adhesion molecules, icam-1 and
 xxxg2406xxx , are shown in the elimination of p. jiroveci in the
neonatal mouse model.22 neutralization of  xxxg2296xxx  through
tnf blockade by infliximab may therefore possibly cause
the occurrence of pcp.
furthermore, it is possible that a loss of activated monocytes/macrophages may be the main cause of the development of pcp associated with infliximab therapy. tumor
necrosis factor alpha is expressed as a membrane-bound form
and subsequently it is released into extracellular spaces by a
 xxxg2296xxx -converting enzyme on cellular membranes.23 since
immune cells produce both membrane and soluble forms of
 xxxg2296xxx , infliximab may induce apoptosis in membrane
 xxxg2296xxx -expressing cells, in a caspase-dependent manner. in
fact, synovial specimens isolated from infliximab-treated
patients revealed that macrophages, but not lymphocytes,
fall into apoptosis.24 the loss of membrane tnfalphaexpressing macrophages may contribute to the development of pcp.
it has been long discussed whether the development of
pcp is due to a reactivation of latent infection or acquisition by person-to-person spread.18,19 in our case, pcp occurred 4 weeks after the second infliximab infusion. data
from pms in japan for infliximab showed that a median
interval from the start of treatment to the occurrence of
pcp was 74.4 days and that all episodes occurred within 22
weeks (http://www.ryumachi-jp.com), suggesting that pcp
may develop through a reactivation of latent infection
rather than through a new exposure to environmental
microorganisms. similarly, tuberculosis in infliximabtreated individuals is thought to be the result of a reactivation of latent infection because most cases of tuberculosis
occur within 12 weeks after an introduction of infliximab
therapy.9 cush mentioned in a review that the risk of infectious death is greatest in the first 16 weeks after drug initiation.7 these reports support the idea that rheumatologists

61

should be on the lookout for occurrence of opportunistic
infections, particularly during the first 6 months after initial
infliximab infusion. in contrast, several studies showed the
possibility that a person-to-person infection may be involved in the occurrence of pcp.25,26 a genotype analysis of
p. jiroveci isolates will provide a good tool for further investigation.
infliximab therapy always carries the risk of opportunistic infections.5–9  xxxd2396xxx  is effective as a prophylactic for
tuberculosis associated with tnf-blocking therapy.27 the
use of tmp-smx as a prophylactic is recommended for
collagen disease patients receiving high-dose steroid
therapy in japan.28 however, the preventive use of tmpsmx against p. jiroveci is impossible during the mtx and
infliximab treatment, since a combination of tmp-smx
and mtx is a contraindication. furthermore, with the decrease of oxygenation and/or the alveolar–arterial oxygen
difference, the risk of death is increased (u.s. public health
service: consensus statement on the use of corticosteroids
as adjunctive therapy for pneumocystis pneumonia in
the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, http://
www.cdc.gov). therefore, a rapid and sensitive detection of
p. jiroveci is important for a good prognosis. saito et al.
stressed the usefulness of pcr for the early diagnosis of
pcp, since this method consists of simple and easy techniques and is superior to cytology in sensitivity.10 durandjoly et al. mentioned in a review that the sensitivity of pcr
to diagnose pcp, using specimens from induced sputum,
oropharyngeal washings, and nasopharyngeal aspirates was
more than 90%, and that pcr targeting the mitochondrial
ribosomal rna (mt rrna) was superior in its sensitivity,
since mt rrna is present in many copies in each microorganism.29 in this study, we used the oligonucleotide primers
specific for mt rrna. nested pcr assays and a southern
blot analysis for pcr products can also increase the sensitivity of detection. regarding the specificity of pcr, several
studies showed that respiratory samples reveal a higher
number of positive pcr results, but a lower predictive
value of pcp occurrence.30–33 most of these individuals had
no development of pcp during a follow-up period of many
months. they might be colonized by p. jiroveci. these problems will be resolved by careful assessments of patient conditions, based on clinical, radiological, and laboratory data.
pms data for infliximab in japan also show frequent
development of noninfectious interstitial pneumonia during
this therapy (pms report in japanese by jcr, http://
www.ryumachi-jp.com). kramer et al. reported an occurrence of mtx pneumonia after initiation of infliximab
therapy for ra.34 we need to differentiate pcp from mtx
pneumonia during infliximab therapy. a typical clinical
symptom of mtx pneumonia is dyspnea with fever. high
levels of serum ldh and crp are noticed in laboratory
findings.35 further, radiological findings show ground-glass
opacity.35 these findings are similar to these observed in
pcp. in this report, we confirmed the presence of p. jiroveci
by using pcr assays. moreover, the measurement of serum
beta-d-glucane value is helpful for a diagnosis of pcp because
beta-d-glucane is a part of the fungus cell wall. in our case, high
levels of serum beta-d-glucane were detected.

in conclusion, we succeeded in the early diagnosis of
pcp in an infliximab-treated patient by using the pcrbased detection of p. jiroveci, which led to the proper and
prompt management of pcp. this patient made satisfactory
progress. we would like to emphasize that the use of pcr
for p. jiroveci using a specimen from induced sputum is a
great help for the diagnosis of pcp and the management of
ra patients treated with tnf-blocking agents.
