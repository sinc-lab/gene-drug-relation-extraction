introduction

morphine is a prototypical opioid agonist most frequently
used clinically to produce analgesia. morphine is weakly
selective to the  xxxg1635xxx  and also possesses affinity
to the delta and kappa opioid receptors. thus, morphine was
long thought to act on all three receptor types to produce
analgesia. this has been supported by in vivo pharmacological
studies (heyman et al., 1987; takemori and portoghese, 1987;
omote et al., 1991). pharmacological studies also suggested
possible interactions among opioid receptors, in particular,
those between the mu and delta receptors in producing
analgesia (larson et al., 1980; vaught et al., 1982; malmberg
and yaksh, 1992). the generation of  xxxg1635xxx 
knockout mice approximately a decade ago and those of the
other opioid receptors that followed led to better understanding of the mechanism of opioid analgesia. surprisingly, the
analgesic effects of morphine were abolished or strongly
reduced in  xxxg1635xxx  knockout mice, indicating that the mu
receptor was mandatory for the analgesic effects of morphine
and that the delta or  xxxg1633xxx  alone could not mediate
morphine's analgesic actions (matthes et al., 1996; sora et al.,
1997b, 2001; loh et al., 1998; schuller et al., 1999; hosohata et
al., 2000; hall et al., 2003). in the initial studies, morphine was
administered systemically most probably with the assumption that systemic morphine acts both in the brain and the
spinal cord. studies utilizing the intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.)
route also showed the ineffectiveness of morphine in mu
receptor knockout mice reflecting the results of studies with
systemic administration (loh et al., 1998; schuller et al., 1999;
hosohata et al., 2000). on the other hand, there have been
indications by studies that when morphine is administered
systemically in animals, its direct action is predominantly in
the brain (manning and franklin, 1998; heinricher et al., 2001).
in these studies, the analgesic effects of systemic morphine
were completely reversed by blocking pathways within the
brain. furthermore, honda et al. (2004) showed that the
analgesic effects of systemic and i.c.v. morphine were
attenuated by muscarinic antagonists, while the antagonist
had no effect on the actions of intrathecal morphine. thus
systemic administration may not reflect the actions of
morphine in the spinal cord, and morphine needs to be
administered intrathecally (i.t.) to specifically observe its
spinal actions. although some studies have suggested the
ineffectiveness of intrathecal morphine in  xxxg1635xxx 
knockout mice (schuller et al., 1999; hosohata et al., 2000),
there have been no studies that fully looked at the effect of
intrathecal morphine on acute thermal pain in these mice.
the present study was designed to examine the analgesic
effects of spinally administered morphine in  xxxg1635xxx 
knockout mice and to determine the possible molecular target
of morphine in the absence of the  xxxg1635xxx .

results

baseline tail flick latencies of wild type and  xxxg1635xxx 
knockout mice were 2.93 ± 0.26 s (n = 58) and 3.00 ± 0.26 s
(n = 70), respectively, and were not significantly different.

2.1.
the antinociceptive effect of spinal morphine in mu
receptor knockout mice and its blockade with naloxone
morphine given i.t. produced a dose-dependent antinociceptive effect in both wild type mice (fig. 1a) and  xxxg1635xxx 
knockout mice (fig. 1b). the dose required to produce a
significant effect was higher in knockout mice than in wild
type mice. the median effective doses (ed50) of morphine
were 0.17 mug (0.07–0.35 mug, 95% confidence limits) and 5.00 mug
(3.01–9.00 mug, 95% confidence limits) in wild type and
knockout mice, respectively (fig. 2), and were significantly
different. doses of morphine  xxxd1891xxx  mug and above could not be
examined in knockout mice because they yielded a paradoxical pain behavior (intermittent bouts of biting and
scratching of affected dermatomes), which has previously
been described in rats (yaksh et al., 1986; yaksh and harty,
1988). this pain behavior has been shown to be nonreversible by naloxone (a non-selective opioid antagonist),
thus is not mediated by opioid receptors. the concomitant
spinal administration of naloxone (10 mug) completely
blocked the antinociceptive effect of morphine in knockout

mice (fig. 3). this indicated that the effect was mediated by
opioid receptors.

2.2.

the involvement of kappa opioid receptors

in order to determine whether kappa opioid receptors are
involved in the antinociceptive effects of morphine in mu
receptor knockout mice, we first examined the antinociceptive
effects produced by spinal  xxxg1633xxx  activation in the
knockout mice. the selective  xxxg1633xxx  agonist,
u50,488h, given i.t. produced a dose-dependent antinociceptive effect in the knockout mice, but required a 2-fold increase
in dose to produce effects similar to those in wild type mice
(fig. 4). the ed50 values of u50,488h were 18.0 mug (14.8–22.9 mug,

95% confidence limits) and 29.3 mug (23.8–47.1 mug, 95% confidence limits) in wild type and knockout mice, respectively (fig.
5), and were significantly different. nonetheless, the results
demonstrated that  xxxg1633xxx  activation produced potent
analgesic effects in  xxxg1635xxx  knockout mice. this indicated
that the  xxxg1633xxx  is functional in these mice and
suggested that the  xxxg1633xxx  may mediate morphine's
analgesic effects in  xxxg1635xxx  knockout mice. next, we
examined whether the analgesic effects of morphine in the
knockout mice could be reversed by a selective  xxxg1633xxx 
antagonist, nor-binaltorphimine (nor-bni, 7.5 mug i.t.). the
analgesic effects of morphine were completely blocked by
nor-bni, indicating that the effects were mediated by the
 xxxg1633xxx  (fig. 6).

the involvement of delta opioid receptors

we next examined the effects of spinal  xxxg1632xxx 
activation in  xxxg1635xxx  knockout mice. a selective peptidic
delta agonist, [d-pen2,d-pen5]enkephalin (dpdpe), given i.t.,

in wild type and  xxxg1635xxx  knockout mice. mice
were tested by the tail flick test. the ed50 values of u50,488h
were 18.0 mug (14.8–22.9 mug, 95% confidence limits) and
29.3 mug (23.8–47.1 mug, 95% confidence limits) in wild type and
knockout mice, respectively.

produced dose-dependent analgesic effects (1–3 mug) in wild
type mice (fig. 7a) while no analgesic effects were observed
in  xxxg1635xxx  knockout mice  xxxd1891xxx  times higher doses (10–
30 mug) (fig. 7b). in contrast to the effects of dpdpe, a selective
non-peptidic delta agonist snc80 given i.t. at a high dose of
45 mug (100 nmol) produced no antinociceptive effects in wild
type mice (fig. 8). a three-fold increase in dose to 135 mug
produced overt paralysis of the hind limbs and the tail,
which became apparent within a few minutes after administration and resembled effects of local anesthetics. due to
the paralysis, antinociceptive effects could not be tested at
this dose. the paralysis was not reversed by naloxone
(10 mg/kg s.c., 15 min prior to administration of snc80) and
therefore was likely a non-specific effect due to the very high

dose. thus, snc80 did not produce observable antinociceptive effects in wild type mice, and was not tested in knockout
mice. although these results revealed differences in actions
between delta agonists in wild type mice, they indicated that,
at least in  xxxg1635xxx  knockout mice, spinal  xxxg1632xxx 
activation does not produce analgesia. thus, the analgesic
effects of morphine in the knockout mice were not likely
mediated by delta receptors. to confirm this, we examined
the effect of naltrindole, a selective  xxxg1632xxx  antagonist,
on the analgesic effects of morphine in  xxxg1635xxx 
knockout mice. naltrindole had no effect on morphine's
analgesic effects (fig. 9).

discussion

the present study demonstrated that morphine can produce
thermal antinociception via the  xxxg1633xxx  in the spinal
cord in the absence of the  xxxg1635xxx . this is the first study
that demonstrated analgesic effects of morphine in mu
receptor knockout mice after spinal administration. the dose

that produced a potent effect in wild type mice (1 mug) was
without effect in knockout mice, but a higher dose (6 mug)
produced a mild nonetheless significant analgesic effect.
further increase in dosage could not be investigated because
of the manifestation of paradoxical pain behavior (see results).
although a few previous reports showed the lack of morphine's analgesic effects in the tail flick test after spinal
administration, these studies only examined doses that
produced submaximal analgesic response in wild type mice
and higher doses were not investigated (schuller et al., 1999;
hosohata et al., 2000). in contrast to the analgesic effects of
intrathecal morphine observed in the present study, i.c.v.
morphine at an extremely high dose of 120 mug has been
reported to be without effect in  xxxg1635xxx  knockout mice
(loh et al., 1998). thus, it appears that there is some difference
between the brain and the spinal cord in the types of opioid
receptors that morphine recruits to produce analgesia. the
lack of recruitment of kappa receptors in the brain might be
explained, at least in part, by the difference in  xxxg1633xxx 
agonists' analgesic potency in the brain and the spinal cord
(porreca et al., 1987; millan et al., 1989; miaskowski et al., 1991;
nakazawa et al., 1991). while systemic morphine has been
demonstrated to be without effect at normal analgesic doses
(∼6 mg/kg), sora et al. (1997b) observed a modest trend of
reduced thermal nociception at a cumulated dose of 56 mg/kg
and loh et al. (1998) reported an ed50 value of approximately
400 mg/kg in the tail flick test. thus extremely high doses of
morphine can produce analgesia in  xxxg1635xxx  knockout
mice even after systemic administration and this may be
reflecting the analgesic effects produced by the spinal action of
morphine. the requirement of such extremely high systemic
doses may be attributable to the difference between the brain
and the spinal cord in the relative magnitude of morphine's
action after systemic administration. previous reports have
suggested that the direct action of systemic morphine to
produce analgesia is predominantly in the brain (manning and
franklin, 1998; heinricher et al., 2001; honda et al., 2004).

the analgesic effects of morphine in  xxxg1635xxx  knockout
mice were mediated by the  xxxg1633xxx  and not by the
 xxxg1632xxx . this was demonstrated by the complete
reversal of morphine's effect by nor-bni and the lack of
antagonism by naltrindole. it should be noted that there is
always the issue of selectivity even with the use of selective
antagonists such as nor-bni and naltrindole. however, in the
present study, we used these antagonists in mu-receptor
knockout mice, thus the possible actions of the antagonists at
the  xxxg1635xxx  can be excluded. furthermore, although the
possibilities of nor-bni having some actions at the delta
receptor and naltrindole likewise at the  xxxg1633xxx  cannot
be excluded, since nor-bni completely blocked the effect of
morphine while naltrindole had no effect, it is plausible to
conclude that the effect of morphine was mediated only by the
 xxxg1633xxx . this indicated that spinal kappa receptors are
functional in the absence of mu receptors, which was also
confirmed by the analgesic effects of the selective kappa
agonist u50,488h in  xxxg1635xxx  knockout mice. however,
while u50,488h produced potent analgesic effects in the
knockout mice, morphine only exerted a limited effect in
these mice at the doses investigated. although this limited
effectiveness may have been merely due to insufficient
dosing, alternatively, it may have been due to a ceiling effect
of morphine at the  xxxg1633xxx . as mentioned above,
higher doses of morphine could not be studied because of the
manifestation of “paradoxical pain behavior” at these doses.
thus, the possibility that morphine has limited efficacy at the
 xxxg1633xxx  could not be investigated in this study.
on the other hand, in the present study we observed that
u50,488h, was less potent in  xxxg1635xxx  knockout mice than
in wild type mice, indicating that the  xxxg1635xxx  plays some
role in the analgesic effects of u50,488h. although u50,488h is
highly selective to the  xxxg1633xxx  in vitro, spinally
administered u50,488h in vivo might have directly activated
mu receptors as well as kappa receptors, and this may have
caused the difference between its effects in wild type and mu

receptor knockout mice. however, it has been shown that
analgesic effects of u50,488h are abolished in  xxxg1633xxx 
knockout mice, indicating that u50,488h is selective in vivo as
well as in vitro (simonin et al., 1998). furthermore, the
analgesic effects of u50,488h were maintained in  xxxg1635xxx 
knockout mice after systemic and i.c.v. administration (loh et
al., 1998; matthes et al., 1998; fuchs et al., 1999; sora et al.,
1999). thus, it is unlikely that the difference in response
between knockout and wild type mice was due to in vivo
kappa selectivity, but was likely due to a mechanism more
specific to the spinal cord. a possible mechanism is the
interactions between the spinal kappa and mu receptors.
interactions may exist at the cellular and/or at the circuit level
in the spinal dorsal horn. co-expression of mu and kappa
receptors have been shown in some neurons of the dorsal root
ganglion (ji et al., 1995) and such co-expression may also exit
in neurons of the dorsal horn. such neurons may be a site of
cellular interaction. however, kappa agonist induced gprotein activation and adenylcyclase inhibition in spinal
cord and/or brain preparations of  xxxg1635xxx  knockout
mice were not different from wild type mice, indicating that
signal transduction induced by  xxxg1633xxx  activation was
not affected by the absence of mu receptors (matthes et al.,
1998). thus cellular interaction between the mu and kappa
receptors does not seem very likely. another possible mode of
interaction between opioid receptor types that has been
proposed is the involvement of endogenous opioid peptide
release (scherrer et al., 2004). in the spinal dorsal horn,
multiple endogenous opioid peptides are expressed within
complex neural circuits and this raises the possibility of
interactions among opioid receptors and endogenous opioid
peptides. the release of an endogenous opioid peptide,
dynorphin, has been demonstrated after the spinal administration of opioid peptides such as endomorphin and [dmt1]
dalda (ohsawa et al., 2001; szeto et al., 2003). thus, a
speculation may be that  xxxg1633xxx  activation causes
downstream release of endogenous opioid peptides such as
endomorphin or enkaphalin that activate the  xxxg1635xxx .
although the lack of mu receptors themselves is most
certainly the predominant cause of the high dose requirement
to produce morphine analgesia in  xxxg1635xxx  knockout mice,
the lack of such possible interaction between the kappa and
mu receptors may also have contributed to some extent.
prototypical peptidic delta agonists (dpdpe and deltorphin
ii) have been utilized to demonstrate analgesic effects
produced by  xxxg1632xxx  activation. in the present study,
the analgesic effects of dpdpe observed in wild type mice were
abolished in  xxxg1635xxx  knockout mice. this indicated that
mu receptors are essential for dpdpe analgesia, which is in
accordance with previous reports (sora et al., 1997a; scherrer
et al., 2004). the results may appear to support the existence of
functional mu/delta interaction suggested by previous pharmacological studies (larson et al., 1980; vaught et al., 1982;
malmberg and yaksh, 1992). however, a recent study by
scherrer et al. (2004) showed that dpdpe and deltorphin ii
given i.c.v. were fully analgesic against acute thermal pain in
mice lacking delta receptors, while being without effect in mu
receptor knockout mice. furthermore, pure  xxxg1632xxx 
activation in the brain by these agonists utilizing mu and
 xxxg1633xxx  combinatorial knockout mice caused very

small antinociceptive effects in the hot plate test and no effect
in the tail flick test (scherrer et al., 2004). these findings
indicated that, in spite of high  xxxg1632xxx  selectivity in
vitro, these peptidic agonists possess very low in vivo delta
selectivity and that their analgesic effects were predominantly
produced by direct activation of mu receptors. since the lack of
effect of dpdpe in  xxxg1635xxx  knockout mice in the present
study may also have been due to its very low in vivo
selectivity, we also examined the effects of snc80, a selective
non-peptidic  xxxg1632xxx  agonist. snc80 is a potent and full
agonist in the gtp gammas binding assay at the  xxxg1632xxx 
(hosohata et al., 2000). because of its non-polar nature, snc80
is expected to have better diffusion properties in nervous
tissues as compared to polar peptidic delta agonists. contrary
to our expectations, snc80 produced no analgesia in wild type
mice even at a high dose of 45 mug. a dose three times higher
produced non-opioid mediated regional paralysis. our findings are in contrast to the report by bilsky et al. (1995) who
showed that snc80 produced dose-dependent antinociceptive
effects in acute thermal pain models after systemic, intrathecal and intracerebroventricular administration in mice. on the
other hand, gallantine and meert (2005) showed that snc80
administered systemically in rats produced no antinociceptive
effects in the tail flick test even at a high dose of 80 mg/kg,
while producing analgesic effects in inflammatory pain and
chemically-induced visceral pain at lower doses. snc80 given
s.c. also produced potent anxiolytic effect mediated by the
 xxxg1632xxx , suggesting that snc80 was systemically active
(saitoh et al., 2004). furthermore, other selective non-peptidic
delta agonists have been shown to lack antinociceptive effects
in acute thermal pain models while significantly reducing
inflammatory pain and chemically-induced visceral pain
(kamei et al., 1995; petrillo et al., 2003). the lack of analgesic
effects of non-peptidic delta agonists in acute thermal pain
together with the lack of  xxxg1632xxx  mediation in the
analgesic effects of dpdpe and deltorphin ii as shown in the
above studies may put forward a possibility that, although the
 xxxg1632xxx  has been thought to mediate thermal antinociception in a degree similar to the  xxxg1635xxx , in reality,
we were merely observing the effect of  xxxg1635xxx  activation
by the peptidic “delta agonists”. on the other hand, zhu et al.
(1999) reported that the thermal antinociceptive effects of
dpdpe and deltorphin ii given spinally were markedly reduced
in  xxxg1632xxx  knockout mice, indicating that the spinal
 xxxg1632xxx  is the major target of these agonists. thus,
further studies are needed to demonstrate whether delta
receptor activation in the spinal cord does or does not produce
potent thermal antinociception. at any rate, the results of the
present study indicated that  xxxg1632xxx  activation at least
in  xxxg1635xxx  knockout mice does not produce thermal
antinociception whether the cause is minimal thermal antinociception in wild type mice to begin with or the existence of
mu/delta interactions. this is in accordance with our finding
that, despite morphine's affinity to both kappa and delta
receptors, its analgesic effects in  xxxg1635xxx  knockout mice
were mediated only by the  xxxg1633xxx  and not by the delta
receptor.
in summary, we demonstrated that, in the spinal cord, the
thermal antinociception produced by morphine is mediated
by the  xxxg1635xxx  at normal analgesic doses, but is also

br a in re s e a rch 1 0 83 ( 20 0 6 ) 6 1 –6 9

mediated by the  xxxg1633xxx  at higher doses. lower
potency of u50,488h in  xxxg1635xxx  knockout mice as
compared to wild type mice may suggest interaction between
kappa and mu receptors at the spinal level. the finding that
the  xxxg1633xxx  is a molecular target of morphine at higher
doses suggests that the  xxxg1633xxx  may play a role in the
analgesia of high-dose morphine regimens used in cancer
pain treatment.

morphine hydrochloride was purchased from takeda chemical industries, osaka, japan. u50,488h, dpdpe, naloxone
hydrochloride, nor-bni dihydrochloride and naltrindole hydrochloride were purchased from sigma chemicals, st. louis,
mo, u.s.a. snc 80 was purchased from tocris, ellisville, mo,
u.s.a. dpdpe and u50,488h were dissolved in distilled water
and snc80 was dissolved in 50% dmso in distilled water
with ph adjusted to 4.5 by hydrochloric acid. other drugs
were dissolved in saline. vehicle was used as control for each
drug.

4.3.

drug administration

intrathecal administrations were performed in unanesthetized mice at the l5–l6 intervertebral space as follows. a
mouse was placed in a handmade mouse holder and was held
gently by its pelvic bone. drug solution was administered into
the intrathecal space by a 30-gauge needle connected to a 10mul hamilton syringe by polyethylene tubing. a flick of the tail
was used as an indication that the needle had penetrated the
dura mater (hylden and wilcox, 1980). all drugs were
administered intrathecally in a volume of 3–5 mul. in preliminary studies, we found that repeating direct intrathecal
injections to the same mouse resulted in unreliable effectiveness of drugs. thus, opioid receptor antagonists were administered concomitantly with morphine in the same drug

67

solution to avoid repeated intrathecal injections. the effect
of intrathecal naloxone has been reported to be present as
early as at 5 min post-administration and still present at
30 min post-administration (yaksh and rudy, 1977; shimoyama et al., 1997). the peak effect of intrathecal nor-bni
has been reported to be 15 min post-administration and
pretreatment times used were 15 to 25 min in previous studies
(takemori et al., 1988; nakazawa et al., 1991; dawson-basoa
and gintzler, 1996). intrathecal naltrindole has been reported
to be effective between 15 and 45 min post-administration
(drower et al., 1991). thus concomitant administration of the
antagonists with morphine can be justified since the peak
effect of intrathecal morphine was observed at 20 to 30 min
post-administration.

4.4.

behavioral testing

testings were performed during the day portion of the
circadian cycle (07:00–19:00 h). the tail-flick test was used
to evaluate antinociceptive responses to thermal pain.
during testing, a mouse was loosely wrapped in a soft
towel and was held gently by the experimenter's hand. the
tail flick response was elicited by applying radiant heat to the
dorsal surface of the tail. the intensity of the heat stimulus
was adjusted so that naive wild type mice flicked their tails
with latencies in a range of 3.0 ± 0.5 s. cut off latency was set
 xxxd1891xxx  s to avoid tissue damage. tail flick latencies were
measured twice with an interval of 30 s, and the mean of the
two latencies was used as the datum for each time point. tail
flick latencies were measured prior to (baseline latency) and
every 10–15 min during a period up to 60 min after
intrathecal administration of each drug (response latency).
the experimenter was blinded to drug treatment throughout
the study. to construct a dose response curve, the percentage of analgesic responders in the group was calculated. an
analgesic responder was defined as one whose mean
response tail-flick latency was 1.5 or more times the baseline
latency value.

4.5.

statistical analysis

comparisons between groups were performed using twoway anovas for repeated measures or student's t test
when appropriate. data were expressed as means ± se. a p
values less than 0.05 was considered significant. the
quantal dose-response data were analyzed using the
bliss-21 computer program. this program maximizes the
log-likelihood function to fit a parallel set of gaussian
normal sigmoid curves to the dose-response data and
provides ed50 values and 95% confidence limits (umans
and inturrisi, 1981).
