density functional theory (dft)-based normal mode calculations have been carried out on models for b12-cofactors
to assign reported isotope-edited resonance raman spectra, which isolate vibrations of the organo−co group.
interpretation is straightforward for alkyl−co derivatives, which display prominent co−c stretching vibrational bands.
dft correctly reproduces co−c distances and frequencies for the methyl and ethyl derivatives. however, spectra
are complex for adenosyl derivatives, due to mixing of co−c stretching with a ribose deformation coordinate and
to activation of modes involving co−c−c bending and co−adenosyl torsion. despite this complexity, the computed
spectra provide a satisfactory re-assignment of the experimental data. reported trends in adenosyl−cobalamin
spectra upon binding to the methylmalonyl coa mutase enzyme, as well as on subsequent binding of substrates
and inhibitors, provide support for an activation mechanism involving substrate-induced deformation of the adenosyl
ligand.

the co-c bond is activated toward heterolytic or homolytic
cleavage in the b12-dependent enzymes.
these processes can in principle be probed via vibrational
spectroscopy.12 co-alkyl stretching vibrations have been
detected by infrared and raman spectroscopy,13-16 and give
an indirect indication of the co-c bond strength.17,18
resonance raman (rr) spectroscopy can provide access to
b12-containing proteins,19-21 since laser tuning can be used
to selectively excite cobalamin vibrations. facile photolysis
of co-alkyl bonds is a significant hurdle, which can,
however, be overcome cryogenically, since geminate recombination is efficient in frozen samples. co-adenosyl vibrations have been detected in various functional states of the
enzyme methylmalonylcoenzyme a mutase (mcm),19,20
using 13/12c and ch/d isotope editing, and also in glutamate
mutase (glm).21 the co-methyl stretching vibration has
been detected in a corrinoid/iron-sulfur protein.22
to interpret these spectroscopic signatures, one needs
reliable assignments of the vibrational modes. the situation
is straightforward in mecbl, which gives a single strong
co-c stretching band at 506 cm-1,12,14,18 but is not straightforward in adocbl, for which a number of features are seen
in isotope difference rr spectra.17-20 an assignment scheme
was suggested,18,20 based on physical arguments, and was
used to infer a mechanism for activation by mcm20 from
changes in the spectral pattern when substrates and inhibitors
were bound to the enzyme.
a primary motivation of the present work was to assess
these assignments and interpretations using density functional
theory (dft) computation. dft has been successful in
modeling the geometries and spectroscopic properties including optical absorption, xes, or xps and vibrational spectra
of metal-containing compounds of considerable complexity,
including metalloporphyrins23,24 and cobalamins.25-29 a
(8) the heterolytic cleavage of the co-c bond to form the methyl
carbocation in cobalamin-dependent methyltransferases should not be
taken literally: these heterolytic reactions are most likely nucleophilic
displacement of sn2-type, and the presence of free carbocations is
not involved. alternative mechanisms have been postulated for methyl
transfer including oxidative addition and single electron transfer but
are less probable (see ref 7 for details).

previous vibrational study of a six-coordinate im-[coiiicorrin]-me+ model30,31 permitted analysis of the most
important interligand modes for mecbl. the dft-based
force field accurately reproduced isotope shifts for interligand
vibrations and provided a semiquantitative description of the
corrin modes. rovira et al.32 have recently reported a
computation of the full mecbl structure, which produced
an accurate co-c stretching frequency (509 cm-1). we now
extend dft to adocbl and find that the results require reassignment of the experimental spectra,17-20 although the
proposed activation mechanism in mcm is not substantially
altered.

n atoms] and ahlrichs vtz (for co) basis sets, successfully used
in previous calculations on cobalamins, was employed in the present
study. frequency calculation and nonresonance raman intensities
based upon polarizability derivatives have been carried for all the
b-[coiiicorrin]-r+ structural models (figure 1). cartesian force
constants calculated at the optimized geometry were transformed
to natural internal coordinates.34 these coordinates were generated
by the fct (force constant transformation) program, which is
included in tx90 program package35 and manually augmented. to
refine the calculated dft force constants, we employed the sqm
procedure, which scales the original dft force constants according
to the formula fij′ ) (lambdailambdaj)1/2fij. the sqm procedure allows
application of single or multiscale factors to refine the originally
computed force constants and to obtain scaled frequencies and their
refined vibrational modes. our vibrational analysis was performed
with the following strategy. first, the sqm refinement of force
constants was utilized with a single scaling factor (lambda ) 0.86)31 for
all computed models of im-[coiiicorrin]-r+ (r ) me, et,  xxxd2401xxx , and ado). resulting nonresoonance raman spectra are shown
in figure 2. for a final comparison of computed isotope difference

experimental spectra, we have decided to refine the originally
computed force constants using the sqm set of seven scaling
factors. this sqm set of scaling factors has been shown previously

results and discussion
alkyl corrins. as in previous studies,25-27 dft gives
satisfactory geometries for alkyl corrins (table 1). for the
methyl adduct, the co-c distance is short, 1.96 å, as it is
in mecbl (1.98 å)37 while the bond to the axial imidazole
is long, 2.22 å, as is the co-dimethylbenzimidazole bond
in mecbl (2.16 å).37 changing the alkyl group to ethyl
lengthens the co-c bond, to 1.99 å, due to a combination
of electronic and nonbonded ethyl-corrin interactions, while
increasing the steric bulk further, to propyl, lengthens the
co-c bond to 2.03 å. interestingly, the co-imidazole bond
lengthens in the same order, to 2.26 and 2.32 å, illustrating
what has become known as the ‘inverse trans influence’.38-43

the computed frequencies fall in the same order, as
expected. the co-c stretching frequencies are in excellent
agreement with reported values for mecbl and etcbl; no
data are available for isopropyl derivatives. stretching
frequencies for the axial base have not been reported;
searches of the me-cobinamide rr spectrum using isotopically labeled imidazole as axial base have been unsuccessful, presumably due to inadequate resonance enhancement.44 the computed co-imidizole stretches are at very low
frequencies (∼100 cm-1)30,31 reflecting the very weak bonds.
interestingly, rovira et al.32 computed a much higher
frequency for the co-dimethylbenzimidazole stretch in
mecbl, 437 cm-1, consistent with a somewhat shorter co-n
bond, 2.15 å; possibly the covalent attachment of the
dimethylbenzimidazole ligand to the corrin ring produces this
shortening, via the chelate effect.

figure 2 shows computed raman spectra for the alkylcorrin-imidazole complexes in the low-frequency region.
most of the bands arise from corrin vibrations, but the co-c
stretches stand out strongly. the computed intensities are
based on classical polarizability derivatives and do no capture
selective resonance effects. nevertheless the co-c stretches
show up prominently in rr spectra of mecbl and etcbl.
figure 3 shows an excellent match of the observed 13/12c
and ch/d difference spectra with computed ones for the
corrin-imidazole analogues. on the other hand, the computed co-imidazole bands are very weak and it is not
surprising that the analogous cobalamin bands have not been
detected.
adenosyl corrins. computed co-c and co-imidazole
bond distances for im-[coiiicorrin]-ado+, 1.99 and 2.22 å,
are similar to those of the ethyl adduct (table 1) and are in
satisfactory agreement with the corresponding distances,
2.033 and 2.237 å, in adocbl.29 the dft calculations
employing the b3lyp functional do not capture the trend
which is experimentally observed for axial bond distances
in adocbl29 and mecbl37 cofactors. this most likely reflects
structural simplifications introduced by truncating the adocbl
side chains and replacing the dimethylbenzimidazole ligand
with imidazole. furthermore, the hybrid b3lyp functional
does not perform as well as nonhybrid bp86, as has been
recently demonstrated.45,46 for both functionals, the frequencies for the co-c bond stretch are overestimated and the
force constants have to be scaled in order to obtain reasonable
agreement with experiment. while the bp86 value is closer
to experiment, the overall performance from a statistical point
of view is better for b3lyp. consequently, the latter was
used in recent dft analyses of co-alkyl and co-adenosyl
vibrational modes in b12-cofactors, consistent with previous
studies.30,31
the computed raman spectrum (figure 2) is very complex; no dominant co-c stretching band can be seen. figure
4 shows the experimental 13/12c and ch/d difference spectra
for adocbl, reported by dong et al.,20 and compares them
with the dft-computed difference spectra. (the intensities
of the bands marked delta and tau were enhanced for visualization.
although their computed polarizability derivatives are low,
they may be enhanced resonantly if the excited state is
displaced along their normal coordinates. they are both
polarized and are subject to the dominant franck-condon
enhancement mechanism.) difference spectroscopy was used
in order to cancel out the numerous rr contributions from
corrin modes and to isolate those vibrations associated with
the co-ado unit. it was recognized that the complex spectral
pattern required at least four isotope-sensitive vibrations, and
these were proposed to be co-c stretching (430 cm-1),
ribose ring deformation (569 cm-1), co-c-c bending (363
cm-1), and a torsion of the adenosyl ligand about the co-c
bond (420 cm-1). indeed, the computed difference spectra
reveal four bands with the requisite isotope sensitivity.
band shapes in the difference spectra are functions of the
intensities, widths, and isotope shifts of the parent bands,
and since the computed intensities do not take resonance
enhancement into account, the computed difference spectrum

modes identified in figure 4.

cannot be expected to reproduce the experimental one
faithfully. nevertheless, there is a reasonable correspondence
between the experimental difference bands and the main
features of the computed spectra. the broad sigmoidal feature
at 567/546 cm-1 in the 13/12c difference spectrum and at 567/
534 cm-1 in the ch/d difference spectrum coincides with
two computed modes having differing isotope sensitivities;
the apparently greater ch/d isotope shift can be accounted
for by the stronger negative peak computed at 540 cm-1 in
the ch/d difference spectrum. experimental 13/12c and ch/d
difference spectra each show a 425 cm-1 band, which finds
a prominent corresponding band in the computed spectra,
while computed and experimental spectra both show a
neighboring 446 cm-1 band only in the ch/d difference
spectra. finally, there is a weak computed couplet corresponding to the 392/382 cm-1 couplet seen in the ch/d
experimental spectrum. as might be expected, there are
additional minor bands in the computed difference spectra
which are not observed in the experimental spectra, presumably because of weak resonance enhancement.
the eigenvectors of the four most prominent modes are
illustrated in figure 5. they involve the same vibrational
coordinates, as had been inferred from the experimental
spectra, namely co-c stretching and torsion, co-c-c
bending, and ribose deformation. however, the computations
show the co-c stretching coordinate to be heavily mixed
with ribose deformation, giving rise to the two modes near
560 cm-1. the coordinates combine in phase for the higherfrequency mode, labeled deltar + nucoc, and out of phase for
the-lower frequency mode, deltar - nucoc. as a result, there is
no ‘co-c stretch’ in the expected 400-500 cm-1 region as
there is for the simpler alkyl corrins. the previous attribution
of the 425 cm-1 band to co-c stretching was based on a
reduced-mass model for the ado ligand. this model is
adequate for the alkyl cobalamins but fails for adocbl
because of the kinematic effect of the ribose ring, whose

deformation coordinate interacts strongly with the co-c
displacement.
instead, the 425 cm-1 mode is seen (figure 5) to be coc-c bending in character (deltacocc); its relatively high
frequency reflects the steric crowding of the ado ligand with
the corrin ring. the 440 and 380 cm-1 modes both involve
torsional motions about the co-c bonds. the h atoms of
the co-ch2 group undergo significant motion, while the c
atom does not; this is why the bands are seen in the ch/d
difference spectrum but not in the 13/12c difference spectrum.
the higher-frequency torsion mode has significant contribution from co-n(corrin) bond stretching (taucoc + nucon), while
the lower-frequency mode (tau′coc) does not (table 2). even
the lower of these modes, 380 cm-1, is much higher than
would be expected for simple torsion about a single bond
and again reflects the nonbonded interactions of the ado
ligand with the corrin ring.
implications for protein activation of b12 coenzymes.
despite the reassignments required by the dft-based normal
mode analysis, the inferences about enzyme activation of
adocbl which were drawn from the rr study of mcm are
still supported. in that study, isotope difference spectra were
monitored as the coenzyme was bound to the apoenzyme,
and then substrates or inhibitors were added. for all these
samples, the 567 cm-1 band appeared at the same frequency,
though with somewhat variable relative intensity. the
identification of this broad band as deltar + nucoc plus deltar nucoc implies that the co-c bond strength is unaffected by
interaction of the cofactor with the enzyme or the subsequent
binding of substrates or inhibitors. this finding is also
supported by recent qm/mm calculations which show that
in the case of mcm the co-c bond remains intact upon
coenzyme binding to apoenzyme.47 there is no indication
that the activation mechanism involves co-c bond weakening.
however, there are rr spectral changes in the 350-450
cm-1 region, which, in light of the current assignments, imply
that the co-c-c bending and co-c torsion coordinates
are affected. specifically, the intensity is diminished for
deltacocc, but augmented for tau′coc, as coenzyme binds to the
enzyme, and these trends are accentuated when substrate is
bound to the active site. these changes in resonance
enhancement imply diminished and augmented displacements
along the deltacocc and tau′coc coordinates between the ground
and the resonant excited state of the chromophore. the

altered displacements in turn imply bending and twisting of
the ado ligand in either the ground or the excited states, or
both.
these kinds of ligand distortions have become the favored
explanation for enzymatic activation of adocbl10,11 since
alternative effects, including modulation of the trans ligand
bond, or distortions of the corrin ring have been largely ruled
out. recent crystallographic studies for two b12-containg
enzymes, glutamate mutase (glm)48 and diol dehydratase
(ddh),49 suggest that the main contribution to co-c bond
cleavage is substrate-induced deformation of the coenzyme,
although the evidence is complicated by the likelihood that

the co(iii) is reduced to co(ii) in the crystals. recent qm/
mm calculations reported by jensen and ryde50 likewise
support adenosyl deformation as the most feasible mechanism
of co-c activation.
one can speculate that nature has chosen the complex ado
ligand because it offers a ready handle for substrate-induced
deformation. the misalignment of the bonding orbitals
resulting from such deformations weaken the co-c bond
along the homolytic dissociation coordinate. in contrast, the
small methyl ligand does not facilitate substrate-induced
deformation and mecbl enzymes do not promote co-c
homolysis. instead, they facilitate heterolytic cleavage by
promoting electrophilic diplacement of the methyl cation.
