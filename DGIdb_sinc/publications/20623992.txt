abstract

 xxxd2838xxx  ( xxxd2838xxx ) is a recombinant, fully human, igg2 anti- xxxg681xxx  receptor
(egfr) monoclonal antibody. this spotlight reviews the clinical efficacy of intravenous  xxxd2838xxx  in
combination with chemotherapy in the first- and second-line treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer and
as monotherapy in chemotherapy-refractory metastatic colorectal cancer, as well as summarizing its
pharmacologic properties and tolerability.  xxxd2838xxx  is indicated for use in patients with wild-type
rather than mutant kras tumors.
the efficacy of intravenous  xxxd2838xxx  6 mg/kg administered every 2 weeks was examined in
randomized, open-label, multicenter, phase iii trials in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer. when
administered as first- or second-line treatment in combination with chemotherapy,  xxxd2838xxx  plus
chemotherapy prolonged progression-free survival to a significantly greater extent than chemotherapy alone
in patients with wild-type kras tumors; no significant between-group difference in overall survival was seen
in the second-line treatment trial. in patients with mutant kras tumors, progression-free survival was
significantly shorter with  xxxd2838xxx  plus oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy (folfox4) than with
folfox4 alone in the first-line treatment trial, with no significant difference between patients receiving
 xxxd2838xxx  plus irinotecan-based chemotherapy ( xxxd467xxx ) and those receiving  xxxd467xxx  alone in the
second-line treatment trial. in chemotherapy-refractory patients with metastatic colorectal cancer,  xxxd2838xxx  monotherapy plus best supportive care prolonged progression-free survival to a significantly
greater extent than best supportive care alone in both the overall population and in patients with wild-type
kras tumors, but not in those with mutant kras tumors. intravenous  xxxd2838xxx  has an acceptable
tolerability profile when administered as monotherapy or in combination with chemotherapy. it is associated with the skin-related toxicities characteristic of egfr inhibitors and appears to have a low risk of

immunogenicity. in conclusion, in patients with wild-type kras tumors,  xxxd2838xxx  is a useful option in
combination with chemotherapy for the first- and second-line treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer or as
monotherapy for the treatment of chemotherapy-refractory metastatic colorectal cancer.

1. pharmacologic properties
 xxxd2838xxx  ( xxxd2838xxx ) is a recombinant, fully human,
igg2 anti- xxxg681xxx  receptor (egfr) monoclonal antibody produced in genetically engineered chinese
hamster ovary cells.[2,3] proposed mechanisms explaining the
antitumor activity of  xxxd2838xxx  include downregulation of
egfr expression resulting from receptor internalization, induction of apoptosis via inhibition of egfr signaling pathways and induction of cell cycle arrest, induction of autophagy,
and inhibition of angiogenesis.[2,4,5]  xxxd2838xxx  demonstrated
antitumor activity in various mouse models of cancer.[2,6-8]
steady state is reached by the third intravenous infusion of
 xxxd2838xxx  6 mg/kg, when administered every 2 weeks.[3]
 xxxd2838xxx  pharmacokinetics are best described by a twocompartment model, with both nonlinear and linear clearance.[9]
2. therapeutic efficacy
results of the randomized, open-label, multicenter, phase iii
prime ( xxxd2838xxx  randomized trial in combination
with chemotherapy for metastatic colorectal cancer to determine efficacy) trial (available as an abstract) indicate that
 xxxd2838xxx  in combination with chemotherapy has efficacy
in the first-line treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer in
patients with wild-type kras tumors.[10] in this trial, patients
with wild-type kras tumors who received  xxxd2838xxx  in
combination with folfox4 had a significantly longer median
progression-free survival (primary endpoint) than those receiving folfox4 alone (9.6 vs 8.0 months; hazard ratio [hr]
0.80 [95% ci 0.66, 0.97]) [folfox chemotherapy comprises
oxaliplatin,  xxxd2147xxx , and fluorouracil].[10]  xxxd2838xxx  in
combination with oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy appeared
detrimental in patients with mutant kras tumors, with a significantly shorter median progression-free survival in patients
receiving  xxxd2838xxx  plus folfox4 than in those receiving
folfox4 alone (7.3 vs 8.8 months; hr 1.29 [95% ci 1.04,
1.62]).[10]
first-line treatment comprising  xxxd2838xxx  plus the  xxxg2413xxx  inhibitor bevacizumab and
chemotherapy did not confer a survival benefit in patients with
metastatic colorectal cancer, according to the results of the
randomized, open-label, multicenter, phase iii pacce (panª 2010 adis data information bv. all rights reserved.

itumumab advanced colorectal cancer evaluation) trial.[11]
rather, in the overall population and in those with wild-type
kras tumors, patients receiving  xxxd2838xxx  plus bevacizumab and oxaliplatin had significantly shorter progressionfree survival (primary endpoint) and overall survival than those
receiving bevacizumab and oxaliplatin, with no significant between-group difference in those with mutant kras tumors.[11]
among patients receiving irinotecan-based chemotherapy, the
median durations of progression-free and overall survival did
not significantly differ between those receiving  xxxd2838xxx 
plus bevacizumab and those receiving bevacizumab alone,
regardless of tumor kras status.[11]
 xxxd2838xxx  plus chemotherapy had efficacy in the secondline treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer in patients with
wild-type kras tumors, according to the results of a randomized, open-label, multicenter phase iii trial (trial 20050181)
[available as abstracts;  xxxd467xxx  chemotherapy comprises
irinotecan,  xxxd2147xxx , and infusional fluorouracil].[12,13] in
this trial, median progression-free survival (co-primary endpoint)
was significantly longer in patients with wild-type kras
tumors receiving  xxxd2838xxx  plus  xxxd467xxx  than in those
receiving  xxxd467xxx  alone (5.9 vs 3.9 months; hr 0.73 [95%
ci 0.59, 0.90]), although median overall survival (co-primary
endpoint) was not prolonged to a significant extent (14.5 vs 12.5
months; hr 0.85 [95% ci 0.70, 1.04]); a significantly higher
objective response rate was seen with  xxxd2838xxx  plus
 xxxd467xxx  than with  xxxd467xxx  alone (35% vs 10%; p < 0.001).[12]
among patients with mutant kras tumors, progression-free
survival, overall survival, and the response rate did not significantly differ between  xxxd2838xxx  plus  xxxd467xxx  recipients
and recipients of  xxxd467xxx  alone.[12]
monotherapy with  xxxd2838xxx  prolonged progression-free
survival in patients with chemotherapy-refractory metastatic
colorectal cancer, according to the results of a randomized,
open-label, multicenter, phase iii trial.[14] median progressionfree survival (primary endpoint) was significantly longer in
patients receiving  xxxd2838xxx  plus best supportive care than
in those receiving best supportive care alone (8 vs 7.3 months;
hr 0.54 [95% ci 0.44, 0.66]).[14] analysis by tumor kras
status revealed that progression-free survival was significantly
prolonged by  xxxd2838xxx  in patients with wild-type kras
tumors (12.3 vs 7.3 months; hr 0.45 [95% ci 0.34, 0.59]), but
not in those with mutant kras tumors (7.4 vs 7.3 months; hr

0.99 [95% ci 0.73, 1.36]).[15] after a median follow-up duration
of 72 weeks, mortality did not significantly differ between
patients receiving  xxxd2838xxx  plus best supportive care and
those receiving best supportive care alone; the lack of a significant overall survival advantage with  xxxd2838xxx  may reflect
the fact that the majority of patients (76%) receiving best supportive care alone crossed over to  xxxd2838xxx  upon disease
progression.[14]
in terms of predictors of response to  xxxd2838xxx  therapy,
trial data demonstrated that the level of egfr expression does
not reliably predict outcome to  xxxd2838xxx  therapy.[16-18] by
contrast, tumor kras status has been shown to predict clinical
response to  xxxd2838xxx  in patients with metastatic colorectal
cancer, with the best outcome seen in patients with wild-type
kras tumors.[10,12,15,19] another possible predictor of response to  xxxd2838xxx  therapy is the egfr gene copy number.[20,21] it has also been suggested that mutant braf[22] or
 xxxg1745xxx [23] or single nucleotide polymorphisms in codon 497 of
egfr[24] may be associated with resistance to  xxxd2838xxx 
therapy, and that low levels of egfr downstream signaling
phosphoproteins (e.g. pmek1, pp70s6k) may be associated
with better treatment outcomes.[25]

pain, anorexia, nausea, diarrhoea, constipation, and vomiting.[14] intravenous  xxxd2838xxx  was associated with a low
risk of infusion reactions,[3] and the development of antipanitumumab antibodies was rare.[28]

3. tolerability
monotherapy with intravenous  xxxd2838xxx  had an acceptable tolerability profile in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer, with the majority of adverse events being of grade
1 or 2 severity.[14] no unexpected adverse events occurred when
 xxxd2838xxx  was administered in combination with folfox4[10] or  xxxd467xxx [13] in the prime[10] and 20050181[13]
trials.
skin-related toxicities were the most commonly reported
adverse event in  xxxd2838xxx  recipients,[10,13,14] and the us
prescribing information carries a black-box warning regarding
this adverse event.[3] the characteristic acneiform skin rash
seen in patients receiving egfr inhibitors (i.e. monoclonal
antibodies or  xxxg2198xxx  inhibitors) usually occurs about
1 week after the start of therapy, reaching maximum severity
after 2–3 weeks.[26] in the randomized, open-label, multicenter,
phase ii stepp (skin toxicity evaluation protocol with
 xxxd2838xxx ) trial, pre-emptive versus reactive skin treatment
approximately halved the incidence of skin-related toxicities in
patients receiving  xxxd2838xxx  in combination with chemotherapy.[27]
other common adverse events (all grades) in patients receiving  xxxd2838xxx  monotherapy included fatigue, abdominal
