abstract
methylmalonyl-coa epimerase (mce) catalyzes the interconversion of d- and l-methylmalonyl-coa in the pathway responsible for the
degradation of branched chain amino acids, odd chain-length  xxxd2154xxx , and other metabolites. despite the occurrence of metabolic disorders in the enzymatic step occurring immediately upstream of mce (propionyl-coa carboxylase) and downstream of mce (adenosylcobalamin-dependent  xxxg1485xxx ), no disease-causing mutations have been described avecting mce itself. a patient, formerly
identiwed as belonging to the  xxxg1414xxx  complementation group of  xxxd1771xxx  disorders but lacking mutations in the avected gene,  xxxg1414xxx , was
tested for mutations in the mcee gene. the patient’s wbroblasts had normal levels of adenosylcobalamin compared to controls, whereas
other  xxxg1414xxx  cell lines typically had reduced levels of the cofactor. as well, this patient had a milder form of methylmalonic aciduria than usually observed in  xxxg1414xxx  patients. the patient was found to be homozygous for a c.139c > t (p.r47x) mutation in mcee by sequence analysis
that was conwrmed by restriction digestion of pcr products. one sibling, also with mild methylmalonic aciduria, was homozygous for the
mutation. both parents and one other sibling were heterozygous. a nearby insertion polymorphism, c.41–160_161inst, heterozygous in both
parents, showed the wild-type conwguration on the mutant alleles. to assess the impact of isolated mce dewciency in cultured cells, hela
cells were transfected with a selectable vector containing mcee-speciwc small interfering rna (sirna) to suppress gene expression. the
reduced level of mcee mrna resulted in the reduction of [14c]-propionate incorporation into cellular macromolecules. however, sirna
only led to a small reduction in pathway activity, suggesting that previously postulated non-enzymatic conversion of d- to l-methylmalonylcoa may contribute to some xux through the pathway. we conclude that the patient’s mcee defect was responsible for the mild methylmalonic aciduria, conwrming a partial requirement for the enzymatic activity in humans.

catalyzes the interconversion of the d- and l-epimers of
methylmalonyl-coa, in the pathway that converts propionyl-coa to succinyl-coa (fig. 1). this pathway is
important in eukaryotes for the breakdown of branched
chain amino acids, odd chain-length  xxxd2154xxx , methionine, threonine, thymine, and cholesterol [1]. in bacteria,
mce is involved in the reverse pathway for propionate

fermentation, glyoxylate regeneration, and the biosynthesis of polyketide antibiotics [2–6].
in humans, a block in the conversion of methylmalonylcoa to succinyl-coa causes methylmalonic aciduria. this
has been most commonly ascribed to a primary defect of
 xxxg1485xxx  (mcm)1 or a block in the conversion of  xxxd1771xxx  to adenosylcobalamin (adocbl), the
essential cofactor of mcm. dietary dewciency of vitamin
b12 and impaired intestinal uptake, resulting from acquired
intrinsic factor dewciency, are the most common causes of
elevated methylmalonic acid in humans. although much
rarer, genetic disorders avecting the cellular uptake of  xxxd1771xxx  and its metabolism also cause methylmalonic aciduria or homocystinuria or both.
in addition to the many known causes of mcm dewciency, another potential source of methylmalonic aciduria
is a block in mce. the inability to convert d- to l-methylmalonyl-coa would be expected to result in excretion of
methylmalonic acid. however, the absence of conwrmed
cases of mce dewciency among the now hundreds of cases
of methylmalonic aciduria shown to be caused by defects in
cobalamin utilization or mutation in mcm led scriver and
colleagues to determine if the interconversion of d- and lmethylmalonyl-coa could occur spontaneously [7]. their
studies in a rat model demonstrated that deacylation of
methylmalonyl-coa to the free acid followed by reacylation to the coa derivative could provide an alternate
mechanism for the generation of the l-methylmalonyl-coa
substrate (fig. 1).
the identiwcation of a human mcee gene has conwrmed the occurrence of the mce protein in human cells
and has allowed the direct examination of the potential for
mutation in this gene as a cause of methylmalonic aciduria.
the human gene was identiwed based on its prediction from
prokaryotic gene arrangements and sequence similarity,
and conwrmed by direct assay of the recombinant enzyme

[8]. mce has also been puriwed from rat [9], sheep [10],
caenorhabditis elegans [11], pyrococcus horikoshii [12], and
propionibacterium shermanii [13,14], and has been crystallized from propionibacterium shermanii [6].
this study examines the sequence of the mcee gene in
a patient that most closely resembled a member of the  xxxg1414xxx 
complementation group, one of the complementation
groups of patients with defects in the cellular metabolism of
cobalamin. we recently showed that the  xxxg1414xxx  group corresponds to mutations in the  xxxg1414xxx  gene which encodes a
protein involved in the synthesis of adocbl [15]. most
patients assigned to the  xxxg1414xxx  group have reduced levels of
adocbl in cells, and they fail to complement each other in
cell fusion experiments [16]. the patient investigated in this
study had been assigned to the  xxxg1414xxx  group because of weak
recovery of [14c]-propionate incorporation in complementation studies with members of the  xxxg1414xxx  group. however,
unlike other  xxxg1414xxx  patients this patient had normal adocbl
levels and no identiwed mutation in the  xxxg1414xxx  gene. one
candidate for a defect in the pathway that had not been
examined is that of mce. the [14c]-propionate incorporation assay requires functional pcc and mcm and is also
expected to require mce (fig. 1). however, the expected
bypass of the mce step through the free acid implied that
defects in mce function should not be detected by this
assay. nevertheless, we examined the mcee gene as a candidate for mutation and show that the patient’s cells are
homoallelic for c.139c > t resulting in a p.r47x stop
codon mutation. one sibling was also homozygous for the
mutation and the parents and another sibling were heterozygous. the proband and homozygous sibling had mild
methylmalonic aciduria. using sirna technology to knock
down the expression of the mcee gene, we conwrm a partial requirement for mce expression in [14c]-propionate
metabolism which, in this proband and her sister, was suyciently impaired for the enzyme dewciency to lead to the
observed increase in methylmalonic acid excretion.
materials and methods
patients and cell lines
fibroblast lines wg2278, wg3080, mch23, and hela cells were
from cell repository, montreal children’s hospital. wg2278 was derived
from the proband, iii-3 (fig. 2). wg3080 is a  xxxg1414xxx  line with frameshift
mutations on each allele [15]. mch23 is a control wbroblast line. dna
from 84 unrelated ceph controls and 67 people of utah origin (clinical
genetics research program, university of utah) were used as controls for
dna sequencing and the restriction digest experiments, respectively.
the proband iii-3, a 12-year-old caucasian female had a normal birth
history and was initially breast-fed for about 4 months. she failed to gain
weight and was treated for severe gastroesophageal rexux. at 13.5 months,
she presented with severe metabolic acidosis, dehydration, and tachypnea,
requiring admission in intensive care following a two day history of intermittent vomiting and diarrhea. urine organic acids indicated severe ketonuria and elevated methylmalonic and methylcitric acid, diagnostic of
methylmalonic aciduria. serum methylmalonic acid was 1314 ng/ml
(normal < 32).  xxxd1771xxx  levels were normal (927 pg/ml, normal 200–
1100). she was given iv glucose and started on a low-protein diet (2.7 g/kg/
day) supplemented with formula lacking propiogenic amino acids, that

contributed about 50% of total protein. she also received  xxxd1771xxx 
every other day by mouth, but she continued to vomit and failed to gain
weight. she was then given  xxxd1771xxx  injections (1 mg im every other
day of ohcbl then changed to twice a week) and started doing much better in terms of weight. for this reason, she was eventually placed on an
unrestricted diet that averaged 4.4 g/kg/day of protein and was judged to
be  xxxd1771xxx -responsive. she continued on an unrestricted diet and on
1 mg daily of oral ohcbl. currently (age 12.5 years), she is on ohcbl and
normal protein intake for her age (100% of rda). her latest carnitine levels are normal (free 30–35 mol/l, not on supplements) and plasma amino
acids are normal with glycine 316–357 mol/l. urine methylmalonic acid
remains high at 180–1456 mmol/mol creatinine. blood counts and basic
metabolic panels are also normal. she has normal growth parameters and
is mentally normal, with average grades in school, although she has
required help in math and spelling up to 5th grade.
the parents of the proband are wrst cousins (fig. 2). a previous son of the
couple is healthy and an older sister had hydrocephalus. urine organic acids
from both parents and the siblings indicated that the older sister with hydrocephalus also has methylmalonic aciduria (95–166 mmol/mol creatinine at 14
years of age, normal < 5). this avected the sister’s motor development which
fell behind at 6 months of age, and she was diagnosed with hydrocephalus at
one year of age. she received a ventriculo-peritoneal shunt at that time and
her development normalized. currently, she only takes  xxxd1771xxx  sporadically in a multivitamin supplement. diet analysis indicates that her protein
intake is self-restricted at 0.47 g/kg per day (55% of rda). she has normal
growth parameters (50–75th percentile for height and weight), except for macrocephaly (head circumference 58 cm, >98th percentile) due to the hydrocephalus, with the shunt still functioning well from the initial surgery. she attends
normal school, with good grades. in addition to the methylmalonic aciduria,
laboratory investigations revealed normal plasma amino acids, normal creatine and blood urea nitrogen, and a free carnitine of 24 in the low normal
range (22–60 mol/l). she has always been asymptomatic from a metabolic
standpoint, despite the surgery for the hydrocephalus.

dna extraction, pcr ampliwcation, and sequencing
genomic dna was isolated using genomic-tip (qiagen, mississauga, on) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. pcr reactions
were performed on genomic dna with primers designed to amplify
exons of the coding sequence and portions of the xanking introns
(table 1). puriwed pcr products were sequenced using the [ 33p]-thermosequenase kit (amersham, piscataway, nj) or using bigdye terminator cycle sequencing version 3.1 on an abi3700 automated dna
sequencer (applied biosystems, foster city, ca) as described previously [17]. an initial diagnostic test using primers e2f and e2r

(table 1) appeared to identify the mutant allele in homozygous fashion
in the patient but also in both parents. further analysis showed that a
sequence variation at the site of the 5⬘-primer e2f suppressed ampliwcation of the wild-type allele in each parent so that only the mutant
allele could be detected in the ensuing pcr test. identiwcation of the
sequence variation and conwrmation of the coding sequence change
were made with primers e2fc and e2rc. diagnostic tests for the
dna changes were made by pcr of genomic dna samples followed
by restriction enzyme digestion and polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis
to test for the presence or absence of existing or introduced restriction
sites in the pcr products. primers e2fc and e2rc were used for the
pcr and taqi for the digestion (16 h at 65 °c in bsa-neb buver 3) for
the detection of c.139c > t. the wild-type sequence was cut with taqi,
giving fragment lengths of 236, 313, and 333 bp, while mutant sequence
remained uncut at the mutation site, giving fragments of 313 and
569 bp. to detect the c.41–160_161inst insertion polymorphism
upstream of mcee exon 2, a snabi cut site was artiwcially introduced
by modiwcation of the sequence of the ins2f primer (underlined nucleotides, table 1). dna was ampliwed using primers ins2f and ins2r
and digested with snabi (18 h at 37 °c in bsa-neb buver 4). the
insertion sequence remained uncut at 223 bp, while the wild-type
sequence gave fragments of 24 and 199 bp.

psilencer experiments
the expression of the mcee and  xxxg1414xxx  genes were disrupted in
hela cells by transfection with plasmids based on psilencer 1.0 (ambion,
austin, tx) using a bio-rad genepulser ii (bio-rad, hercules, ca). the
vector was modiwed by the introduction of a selectable marker for mammalian cell culture into the vector sequence. the u6 promoter and the
stem–loop sirna of psilencer were excised using kpni and asei and
ligated with pegfp-n1 (bd bioscience inc., san jose, ca) that had also
been cut with the same enzymes. this combined vector was called pxuchu.
the vector retains the u6 promoter and insert site from psilencer and the
kanamycin/neomycin resistance marker from pegfp-n1. this combination allowed for the batch selection of transfected cells using  xxxd2191xxx 
( xxxg418xxx -sulfate) (stratagene, la jolla, ca).
the mcee antisense sirna oligonucleotide template was 5⬘-tcga

3⬘-aattaaaaaagctcccattccaacagtaatctcttgaatta
ctgttggaatgggagc-5⬘ (19 nucleotide coding sequence in both
orientations underlined with spacer sequence in between). for knockdown
of  xxxg1414xxx  expression, the sirna oligonucleotides were: 5⬘-tc
gagtactcatctcggatcaggttcaagagacctgatccgag
atgagtactttttt-3⬘, and 3⬘-catgagtagagcctagtccaa
gttctctggactaggctctactcatgaaaaattaa-5⬘. the oligonucleotides, each at 100 m, were annealed by incubation in a 1£ dilution of annealing buver (7£ concentration: 1 m tris–hcl, ph 7.6,
100 mm mgcl2, and 160 mm dithiothreitol). the mixture was held at
95 °c for 5 min in a heating block to assure complete denaturation, following which the block was removed from the holder to allow slow cooling to
room temperature. the restriction sites create overhangs that were
digested with xhoi and ecori for ligation of the annealed oligonucleotides into pxuchu. these vectors, px-mcee and px- xxxg1414xxx , were transformed into escherichia coli, selected by kanamycin resistance and veriwed
by sequencing. the correct plasmids were ampliwed and puriwed using
qiaprep miniprep kit (qiagen, valencia, ca).
hela cells were grown to 80% conxuence in 35 cm2 plates in dmem
(invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 0.01% sodium
pyruvate, 0.01% l-glutamine, and 0.01% penicillin/streptomycin in a 37 °c
incubator with 5% co2. the cells were washed with 10 ml pbs, trypsinized and pelleted by centrifugation for 10 min at 3000 rpm. the pbs wash
was repeated and the cells were resuspended in 500 l pbs. the cell suspension was transferred to electroporation cells and placed on ice 10 min.
ten microliters of 20 mg/ml plasmid was added along with 300 l pbs.
the mixture was electroporated at 250 volts for 40 ms. the cells were left
on ice for 20 min and transferred to a 35 mm dish with 10 ml prewarmed

growth medium and incubated at 37 °c, 5% co2 overnight. the medium
was replaced with growth medium containing antibiotic (50 g/ml  xxxd2191xxx ) to select for transfected colonies. the cells were grown a minimum of
10 days with complete antibiotic-medium replacement performed daily.
cells were split when they reached 80% conxuence. for every experiment,
a plate of untransfected hela cells and hela cells transfected with the
pegfp-n1 vector were used as positive controls for the [14c]-propionate
assay. fibroblast line wg3080 ( xxxg1414xxx  group) was used as a negative control
since it is null for a functional  xxxg1414xxx  protein [15]. all experiments were
performed in triplicate, unless otherwise stated. northern blotting was
used to conwrm mrna knock-down. fragments of cdna, ampliwed by
pcr, were labeled using random priming (rediprime ii, amersham) with
[32p]-dctp incorporation. blots were probed with labelled cdnas for
 xxxg1414xxx , mcee, and -actin cdna (loading control). for  xxxg1414xxx , a
probe was generated from a 508-bp cdna segment amplifying regions
380–887 bp of the full-length cdna [15]. for mcee, a probe was generated from a 365-bp cdna segment amplifying 145–509 bp of the cdna.
human -actin cdna was used as a control (clontech laboratories,
mountain view, ca).

[14c]-propionate assay
the protocol was from watkins et al. [16]. cell cultures were incubated
for 18 h at 37 °c in 5% co2 in puck’s f medium supplemented with 15%
dialyzed fetal bovine serum and 0.1 mm [1¡14c]-propionate (moravek
radiochemicals, brea, ca), diluted with unlabelled sodium propionate to
give a speciwc activity of 10 ci/mol. following incubation, the cells were
harvested and washed three times in pbs and 3£ in 1 ml ice-cold 5% trichloroacetic acid for 15 min at 4 °c. the precipitated material was dissolved in 1 ml of 0.2 m naoh for 3 h at 37 °c. the amount of label
incorporated into protein was determined by scintillation counting 700 l
of the dissolved material. the total amount of protein was determined in
duplicate using the bio-rad protein assay on 100 l of the dissolved
material for each reaction.

results
in previous studies, wg2278, the wbroblast line from the
proband (iii-3, fig. 2), was thought to demonstrate interallelic complementation with the  xxxg1414xxx  complementation
group, showing complementation with wve but failing to
complement three other  xxxg1414xxx  lines [16]. however, following
the cloning of the  xxxg1414xxx  gene responsible for the  xxxg1414xxx 
complementation group, no mutations were identiwed in
wg2278. the cell line also showed normal adocbl synthesis from [57co]cncbl (21.2% of total cbl), in contrast with
other  xxxg1414xxx  or cblb cell lines with conwrmed mutations in
the  xxxg1414xxx  or  xxxg1415xxx  genes, respectively, which typically
give adocbl levels of <7.5% (table 2). nevertheless,
wg2278 had reduced [14c]-propionate incorporation into
cellular macromolecules (1.8 compared to 10.8 § 3.7 nmol/
mg protein/18 h for control cell lines), conwrming a defect in
propionate metabolism.
an alternate possibility was mutation in another gene
that would lead to a block in [14c]-propionate incorporation. candidate genes such as mut or  xxxg1415xxx  were ruled
out since wg2278 complemented cells with mutations in
these genes and no mutations were identiwed by sequencing
of all exons and xanking sequences. an additional candidate was mcee, although mutations in this gene had yet to
be identiwed and it was uncertain if a defect in mce would
result in a reduction in [14c]-propionate incorporation.

dna sequence analysis of the exons and xanking
sequences of the mcee gene revealed a homozygous mutation, c.139c > t (p.r47x), in wg2278. diagnostic tests on
pcr products using the taqi restriction enzyme to distinguish control (fragment sizes 236, 313, and 333 bp) and
mutant dna (313, 569 bp) were performed to conwrm the
mutation in wg2278 and determine genotypes in family
members (fig. 2). this experiment conwrmed that the parents (ii-1, ii-2) and one sibling (iii-1) were heterozygous,
while a second sibling (iii-2) was homozygous for the
mutation. restriction digests of pcr products showed that
the mutation was not present in 67 control dna samples
from individuals of utah origin, and it was not present in
any of the 99 ests corresponding to mcee cdna
sequence available at dbsnp www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/snp.
during the course of these experiments, an insertion
polymorphism was identiwed in both parents 160 bp
upstream of exon 2 (c.41–160_161inst) and 259 bp
upstream of the mutation site. the insertion was conwrmed
by a pcr reaction in which the 5⬘ primer sequence (ins2f,
table 1) was modiwed to include a snabi site which was
cleaved in dna without the insertion (fragment sizes 199
and 24 bp) but not in its presence (223 bp; fig. 2). the insertion was observed in heterozygous fashion in both parents
and the unavected sibling (iii-1). both avected siblings
lacked the insertion upstream of the disease mutation, demonstrating that the insertion polymorphism was present on
the parents’ wild-type allele and absent on the mutant
allele. sequence analysis of dna from the 84 ceph control samples showed the insertion to be present with a frequency of 0.65, making it the common allele.
given the reports of a minimal requirement for mce in
cells, it became important to determine if a block in mce
alone could be pathogenic in contrast to the possibility that
the disease in the proband might have been caused by an
additional defect at a diverent step in the pathway. the
requirement for mce function was evaluated by the use of
sirna to suppress the expression of the mcee gene in
hela cells. a modiwed vector, pxuchu, combining the u6
promoter and hairpin structure of psilencer and the neomycin resistance marker of pegfp-n1 was used to silence
the expression of mcee. the modiwed vector permitted
batch selection of transfected cells by treatment with  xxxd2191xxx  beginning two days after the transfection procedure.
hela cells were independently transfected with px-mcee
and px- xxxg1414xxx , the latter as a test of the eycacy of the

sirna technique. inhibition of  xxxg1414xxx  gene expression
was used as a control because it could be evaluated by the
same [14c]-propionate incorporation technique and could
be compared with the results for a wbroblast line from a
patient with  xxxg1414xxx  mutations. hela cells transfected with
either plasmid showed absence of the corresponding
mrna by northern blot (figs. 3a and b). hela cells
alone or transfected with pegfp-n1 incorporated [14c]propionate to a similar extent, indicating that the plasmid

did not adversely avect metabolism or macromolecular
synthesis (fig. 3c). in contrast, cells transfected with
px- xxxg1414xxx  showed a reduction in [14c]-propionate uptake
to 54 § 17% of control activity, while cells transfected with
px-mcee had activity of 70 § 19% compared to control.
these results were compared with [14c]-propionate uptake
in patient cell line wg3080 which has two null-type mutations in the  xxxg1414xxx  gene (c.260–267dup; c.592–595del) [15].
it was used as a negative control and gave 11 § 3% of control values.
discussion
in this study, a patient with mild methylmalonic aciduria, formerly identiwed as belonging to the  xxxg1414xxx  complementation group, was found to be homoallelic for a stop
codon mutation c.139c > t (p.r47x) in the mcee gene.
the mutation was heterozygous in both parents and one
sibling and homozygous in an asymptomatic sibling who
also had methylmalonic aciduria. in addition to the coding
sequence mutation, an insertion polymorphism, c.41–
160_161inst, was found that segregated in the family, with
the c.139c > t mutation coupled with the absence of the
insertion. the insertion allele was present at 0.65 frequency
in 84 ceph control samples. given its frequency and its
proximity to exon 2, its presence needs to be considered in
the examination of the gene for exon 2 mutations, including
the one found here. both patients had mild methylmalonic
aciduria and associated mild metabolic disturbances that
were documented in the proband but were largely absent in
the avected older sister. the proband also had a history of
gastroesophageal rexux early in life that resolved, a complication occasionally noted in propionic acidemia and methylmalonic acidemia [18]. in contrast, while the avected
sister was diagnosed with hydrocephalus, corrected surgically at one year of age, she had no clinical manifestations
of methylmalonic acidemia. it is unclear whether these disparate wndings imply other genetic changes in the avected
boy that were not identiwed in this study. while we ruled
out mutations in  xxxg1414xxx ,  xxxg1415xxx , or mut, there are
undoubtedly other genes yet to be identiwed in the mitochondrial pathway. however, highly divergent presentations of avected siblings do occur in metabolic diseases,
including an example in propionic acidemia, blocked in the
step before mcee. hsia and colleagues reported a family
in which a 13-year-old sibling of a child diagnosed with
propionyl-coa carboxylase dewciency was also found to be
avected [19]. while the younger brother had a severe metabolic ketoacidosis, his sister had never been symptomatic or
excreted urinary metabolites associated with propionate
although she did have elevated propionate in her blood.
the marginal expression of the defect in the two siblings in
the mcee study, above a threshold in one and below in the
other, is the more likely explanation for the diverent impact
of their diseases. resolution of the speciwcs of the clinical
and biochemical phenotype will require the description of
additional cases of mce dewciency.

despite this link between the disrupted mcee gene and
methylmalonic aciduria, the previous evidence for the lack
of a requirement for mce in cells left open the possibility
that additional mutations in another aspect of  xxxd1771xxx 
or propionate metabolism might be contributing to the
metabolic block in the patient’s wbroblasts. sequence analysis ruled out  xxxg1414xxx ,  xxxg1415xxx , and mut as candidate
genes. in addition, to address whether metabolism via free
methylmalonate was also contributing to the mce step, we
examined an artiwcially introduced block in mcee mrna
expression in hela cells as a way to generate isolated mce
dewciency. following sirna treatment that reduced
mrna to undetectable levels by northern blot, we
observed impairment of [14c]-propionate incorporation,
but only marginally to about 70% of control values. a similar experiment comparing a wbroblast line with a genetically complete block in  xxxg1414xxx  produced »10% of normal
propionate incorporation while the corresponding sirna
experiment reduced pathway activity to only just over 50%.
this placed the baseline for a seemingly complete block in
mcee expression by sirna at about 50%. the 70% level
observed is only marginally reduced and therefore compatible with some bypass activity through the free acid. the signiwcant level of propionate incorporation in the  xxxg1414xxx 
sirna experiment is not unexpected despite the obviously
low level of mrna. any residual mrna would generate
wild-type protein. this would produce xux through the
pathway and any xow beyond the metabolic block would
be enhanced by cross feeding to more evectively blocked
cells, a phenomenon routinely observed in complementation experiments [20]. thus, the small but detectable reduction in propionate incorporation due to the mcee block in
the hela cells suggests that a genetic block at this step
would be suycient to produce a detectable methylmalonic
acid excretion in patients.
interesting support for a potential physiological consequence of mce dysfunction comes from studies of mce in
c. elegans. under normal growth conditions, a deletion
mutant of mce, mce-1(ok243), shows no obvious phenotypic alterations [11]. however, when grown in media for
the artiwcial generation of reactive oxygen species, the
mutant worms demonstrated increased survival compared
to wild-type. although the mechanism was not evident,
mechanisms as diverse as protective or sparing evects of
mce metabolites or evects on the mitochondrial respiratory chain were discussed. whether or not such evects
might apply to humans, the authors note the widespread
occurrence of mce and the signiwcant conservation of
sequence across species as attesting to the importance of
this enzyme, possibly beyond its role in facilitating the
metabolism of propionyl-coa.
our results underscore the importance of functional
mce in human cells. it is evident that the alternate conversion of d- to l-methylmalonyl-coa is insuycient in the
absence of mce to support the required metabolic xux
through the propionate pathway. it is encouraging that the
asymptomatic, avected sister appears to successfully

self-regulate her protein intake, suggesting that such
patients may be easily managed. while the proband was
considered to be  xxxd1771xxx -responsive, her wbroblasts
were not and a defect in mce would not be expected to
lend itself to an evect of  xxxd1771xxx  administration. this
aspect requires further study.
it is possible that mild, isolated methylmalonic aciduria is more common in children than implied by the seeming rarity of this wnding. if most infants with mce
dewciency are clinically asymptomatic, then the disorder
might be easily missed. while elevated serum or urine
methylmalonic acid might most often be seen as an indicator of  xxxd1771xxx  dewciency, especially with concurrent
increased homocysteine, our results add to the growing
list of genes associated with disorders of isolated methylmalonic aciduria that should be considered in infants
identiwed with elevated methylmalonic acid in newborn
screening programs [21,22].
