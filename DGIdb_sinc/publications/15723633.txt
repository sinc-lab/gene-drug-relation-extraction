thalidomide as an immunotherapeutic agent: the effects on neutrophilmediated inflammation
kozo yasui*, norimoto kobayashi, takashi yamazaki, kazunaga agematsu
department of pediatrics, shinshu university school of medicine
abstract: thalidomide was developed in the 1950s as a sedative drug and withdrawn in 1961 because of its teratogenic
effects, but has been rediscovered as an immuno-modifying drug. it has been administered successfully for the treatment
of erythema nodosum leprosum, aphthous ulceration in hiv disease, inflammatory bowel diseases, and multiple
myeloma. so far, investigations into the mode of action of thalidomide have focused on lymphocytes and vascular
endothelial cells and have shown that this agent inhibits the production of  xxxg2296xxx  (tnf)-alpha and is an
inhibitor of tumor angiogenesis.
recently, other immunological effects of this drug have been gaining attention, including attenuation of neutrophil
activation and inhibition of myelo-proliferative responses. in autoimmune diseases, inflammation is characterized by an
influx of granulocytes, and the association of granulocytes with gastrointestinal ulcer formation or rheumatic arthritis has
been well documented.
the suppressive effect of thalidomide on the activation of the nuclear transcription factor  xxxg1559xxx  may explain these
effects of thalidomide. nf- kappab is retained in the cytoplasm with  xxxg1561xxx , and is activated by a wide variety of inflammatory
stimuli including tnf, il-1 and endotoxin followed by its translocation to the nucleus. constitutive activation of  xxxg1559xxx 
has been detected in various inflammatory diseases, while angiogenesis and organogenesis also require  xxxg1559xxx  activation.
thalidomide, on the other hand, has been shown to selectively suppress  xxxg1559xxx  activation induced by inflammatory
mediators.  xxxg1559xxx  is known to be located downstream of proliferative and/or survival signaling induced by growth factors,
which regulate anti-apoptotic genes. myeloid cells in vitro, however, have been found to proceed to apoptosis as the result
of the treatment with thalidomide and subsequent inactivation of  xxxg1559xxx . these findings are consistent with clinical
symptoms that showed the recovery from leukocytosis and/or neutrophilia after the administration of thalidomide. these
findings shed new light on the anti-inflammatory properties of thalidomide and suggested that they may inhibit
granulocyte-mediated tissue injury.

introduction
thalidomide is a synthetic derivative of  xxxd2431xxx 
and was first introduced in 1957 as a sedative agent in the
german pharmaceutical market (table 1), where it was
promoted as the best sedative agent for pregnant and nursing
mothers because of its rapid onset of effect and apparent
safety. in the us, however, thalidomide had not yet been
approved by the food and drug administration (fda)
because of its peripheral neuropathic adverse effect [1, 2].
early in 1960, the first drug-associated birth defects were
reported [3 - 5]. thalidomide was subsequently withdrawn
from sale, but not before 12, 000 babies with thalidomideassociated birth defects had been born worldwide, of which
about two-thirds survived [2, 6].
four decades later, the fda newly approved thalidomide
for the treatment of erythema nodosum leprosum (enl), a
complication of leprosy (hansen’s disease). interest in
thalidomide has intensified in recent years as research has
identified and clarified its anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory properties. many recent publications have

reported the possible use of thalidomide for a wide range of
conditions, such as rheumatological diseases [7 - 9], aidsrelated kaposi’s sarcoma [10, 11], cutaneous lupus erythematosus [12], tuberculosis [13] and inflammatory bowel
diseases [14 - 17]. in addition, thalidomide has been used for
the treatment of complications arising in bone marrow allograft recipients, while its efficacy for chronic graft-versushost disease (gvhd) has been convincingly documented
[18].
immunomodulatory actions
a major landmark in the clinical development of thalidomide came in 1991 when an in vitro study demonstrated
that it could inhibit the synthesis of the proinflammatory
cytokine  xxxg2296xxx  (tnf)-alpha by activated
monocytes stimulated with lipopolysaccharide (lps) in vitro
[19, 20]. since tnf-alpha is a key regulator of other proinflammatory cytokines and of leukocyte adhesion molecules,
and is a priming activator of inflammatory cells, it represents
a therapeutic target for a number of conditions as demonstrated by the success obtained with specific anti-tnf-alpha
drugs such as infliximab and eternercept. the validation of
tnf-alpha blockade as a therapeutic treatment has led to
thalidomide being used to treat patients with various
inflammatory diseases including rheumatoid arthritis [7],

crohn’s disease [21] and behςet’s disease [22]. its efficacy
is thought to be due to an increase in the rate of tnf-alpha
mrna degradation in these diseases [23], and, in fact, when
given to some patients with enl, thalidomide was found to
reduce circulation levels of tnf-alpha [24].

be the result of reducing tnf-alpha production or modulating tcell responses without inhibiting normal immunity, which is
different from the effect of other anti-tnf-alpha drugs.

thalidomide has also demonstrated its efficacy in several
diseases where tnf-alpha does not seem to play a central
pathogenetic role by inhibiting the dna-binding factor  xxxg1559xxx  through a mechanism that involves the suppression of
 xxxg463xxx  [25].  xxxg1559xxx  is retained in the cytoplasm together
with  xxxg1561xxx , and is activated by a wide variety of inflammatory stimuli including tnf, il-1 and endotoxin [26].
the blockade of  xxxg1559xxx  may thus interfere with the positive
regulation of the expression of genes involved in numerous
immune and inflammatory responses. this suggests that
thalidomide may represent a therapeutic alternative for some
rheumatological diseases, especially when patients show
resistance to treatment with infliximab and eternercept. as a
result of these findings, interest in the mechanism of
thalidomide has been growing apace.

identification of the mode of action of thalidomide has
mostly focused on mononuclear leukocytes and vascular
endothelial cells. however, other immunological effects
have been gaining attention recently, including attenuation of
phagocyte (neutrophil and macrophage) activation and inhibition of myelo-proliferative responses. phagocytes constitute a first line of defense against an invading microorganism, and in several autoimmune diseases, inflammation is
characterized by the influx of phagocytes including neutrophils. it is known that phagocyte activation is typified by
degranulation and the primed release of elastase and superoxide anion production [32 - 35], while excessive production
of various interleukins and other substances by mononuclear
cells and neutrophils results in systemic tissue injury [32,
34]. however, detailed knowledge of the effects of thalidomide on neutrophil functions is still limited.

recently, thalidomide has become associated with a
range of immunomodulatory actions, for example the inhibition of lymphocyte proliferation induced by alloantigen,
mitogen and superantigen molecules, while its action does
not seem to be related to the direct inhibition of il-2
production [27, 28]. most striking is recent in vitro evidence
that thalidomide is a potent costimulator of human t cells in
vitro, resulting in the promotion of th2-type immunity [29].
the drug’s effects have been shown to be synergistic with
stimulation by the t-cell receptor complex, with co-stimulation more pronounced in cd8 than in cd4 lymphocytes. in
healthy volunteers,
reduced the ratio of the
+ thalidomide
+
circulating cd4 cd8 t-cell population [30], an effect that
may be mediated at the level of cytokine regulation. in
addition, its potent and specific effect on cytokine production
relating to lymphocyte differentiation has been demonstrated
[29, 31]. finally, thalidomide was found to enhance the
production of il-2, il-4 and interferon-gamma in peripheral blood
mononuclear cell cultures [8]. in addition, thalidomide is not
associated with infectious complications, such as easy
susceptibility to tuberculosis, because the drug’s action may

inhibition of neutrophil responses

thalidomide was first reported to reduce phagocytosis by
neutrophils and monocytes [36]. dunzendorfer et al. [35]
and downey et al. [37] then reported that treatment of
human umbilical vein endothelial cells with thalidomide
resulted in a modulation of transmigration of neutrophils,
and that these effects depended on the stimulus used [35].
thalidomide was shown to antagonize lps-activated transmigration of neutrophils but not the effects of tnf-alpha and  xxxg1169xxx . tnf-alpha and lps inhibit neutrophil chemotaxis induced by
the stimulation of chemotactic peptides but not random
migration. thalidomide was found to augment the inhibition
of chemotaxis caused by tnf-alpha but not that caused by lps,
whereas it did not effect neutrophil respiratory burst activity
triggered with chemotactic peptide in vivo. ex vivo experiments by juffermans et al. [38] showed that activation of
granulocytes is usually associated with an upregulation of
 xxxg1206xxx  and a concurrent downregulation of l-selectin [39].
ingestion of thalidomide is associated with a reduction in the
upregulation of the neutrophil activation marker  xxxg1206xxx  and
a reduced capacity to release elastase and lactoferrin after

thalidomide as an immunotherapeutic agent

stimulation with lps or lipoteichoic acid. in addition,
preincubation with thalidomide enhances random migration
of lymphocytes but shows no effect on chemotaxis towards
 xxxg363xxx  [40]. these findings may represent immunomodulative actions exerted by thalidomide on phagocyte-mediated tissue injury and/or lymphocyte homing phenomena.
effects on anti-myelo-proliferative actions and granulocyte apoptosis
the anti-angiogenic action of thalidomide has been used
to treat refractory multiple myeloma [41, 42]. in addition, it
has become evident that more potent thalidomide derivatives
are capable of direct antitumor and anti-proliferative action
in the absence of accessory cells [43, 44]. significant myelosuppression frequently develops during the administration of
thalidomide [41, 45]. myeloid cells in vitro proceed to
program cell death (apoptosis) as the result of treatment with
thalidomide, and a recent study achieved growth arrest via
the early induction of g2/m cell cycle arrest, which led to
 xxxg341xxx -mediated apoptosis [46]. there is also clear
evidence that thalidomide analogs are capable of antiangiogenic action [43], while a thalidomide analog was
found to inhibit human endothelial cell proliferation [45, 47],
thus possibly effecting bone marrow vessels and/or stromal
cells, which also results in myelosuppression. a recent study
demonstrated that thalidomide induces monocyte apoptosis
via caspase and the  xxxg569xxx -dependent pathway [48].
thalidomide reduces peripheral macrophage and neutrophil
counts, indicating that the drug may contribute to the immunomudulatory properties required for this action. phagocytes
play important roles at inflammatory sites resulting from
bacterial infections and immunologicalal disorders, and the
removal of phagocytes from these inhibits tissue damage by
activated phagocytes under normal non-pathogenic conditions. the unnecessary prolongation of phagocyte life and
augmentation of bactericidal capability may produce toxic
substances such as leukotriene and superoxide [49]. finally,
it has been proposed that the regulation of neutrophil and
macrophage apoptosis is a key mechanism for the inhibition
of inflammatory disease and tissue damage.
mechanism of effect of thalidomide on neutrophils
recently, we used thalidomide treatment for two cases of
juvenile onset of severe entero-behςet’s disease accompanied by corticosteroid dependence and severe side effects
[50]. growth disturbance induced by steroid treatment was
marked, and one of the patients developed significant steroid
toxicity accompanied by drug-induced osteoporosis and
eventually depressed vertebral bone fracture, while the other
developed diabetes mellitus. neither responded to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, but both showed dramatic
improvement with thalidomide therapy. peripheral neutrophilia was observed and histological studies identified that
neutrophil-mediated vasculitis was characterized in the
intestinal area and skin lesions. the association of neutrophils with oral and gastrointestinal ulcer formation or
vasculitis has also been convincingly demonstrated in several
diseases including behςet’s disease [51], and enhanced
neutrophil functions have been observed in patients with
behςet’s disease who were positive for hla-b51 [52]. after
the administration of thalidomide to our patients, who were

current pharmaceutical design, 2005, vol. 11, no. 3 397

negative for hla-b51, we did not observe any further
changes in the neutrophil functions triggered by chemotactic
peptide. at the same time, white blood cell counts had
decreased in association with improvements in inflammatory
signs and skin lesions. it is thus possible that thalidomide
can suppress cytokine-mediated neutrophil activation in vivo
and alleviate neutrophil-mediated vasculitis without inhibiting normal phagocytic immunity. there is abundant evidence that human neutrophils possess more than one
pathway by which they exert their different functions [53].
we previously demonstrated that both neutrophil respiratory
burst and neutrophil migration require tyrosine phosphorylation in the signaling pathway, but that only the former needs
partial phospholipase d and map kinase activation [54].
again, thalidomide treatment did not effect the neutrophil
respiratory burst activity, suggesting that the molecular
target of thalidomide among the neutrophil functions may be
distinct from the pathway required for stimulation of the
respiratory burst.
proinflammatory mediators such as tnf-alpha and lps
(endotoxin) can modulate neutrophil survival [55, 56].
recent studies have shown that constitutive and tnfinduced apoptosis in human neutrophils is regulated by the
transcription factor  xxxg1559xxx  [57 - 59] (fig. 1). castro-alcaraz
et al. [60] used pharmacological inhibitors to demonstrate
that tnf-alpha- and lps-induced activation of  xxxg1559xxx  in
neutrophils is specifically regulated by  xxxg1561xxx  and associated
with caspase-3 activation. in addition,  xxxg1559xxx  activation was
shown to be regulated by novel protein kinase c-delta (pkcdelta)
but not by other pkcs [61] in tnf-alpha-stimulated neutrophils.
the evidence provided by wiedermann and colleagues [40]
that thalidomide can reverse the inhibitory effect of
 xxxd2195xxx  on the pkc activation indicates that
thalidomide interacts directly with pkc. thalidomide may in
fact be the sole modulator of these pkc and  xxxg1559xxx  activations in association with neutrophil functions and cellular
survival.
the effect of thalidomide on apoptotic pathways has been
studied in myeloma cells [46], and the results showed
multiple effects, including inhibition of  xxxg1559xxx  and enhanced
sensitivity to fas-induced apoptosis. a range of myeloma
cell lines derived from patient bone marrow was shown to be
susceptible to thalidomide-induced g1 growth arrest. this
antimyeloma effect could be overcome with the addition of
growth factor il-6, suggesting that inhibition of the growth
signal may be the mechanism responsible for this effect.  xxxg1559xxx  is retained and inactivated with  xxxg1561xxx  in the cytoplasm,
which inhibits prolongation and/or differentiation of cells.
since both angiogenesis and myelopoiesis require  xxxg1559xxx 
activation [62, 63], we hypothesize that thalidomide may
mediate these activities through suppression of  xxxg1559xxx  and
that inhibition of pkc may also be involved in these events.
phosphoinositide 3-kinases (pi3ks) could be potential
pharmacological targets of thalidomide. pi3ks constitute a
family of lipid kinases that is thought to regulate an array of
fundamental neutrophil responses, including cellular migration, superoxide production, priming effect, and protection
from apoptosis [64, 65]. neutrophils express all four types of
pi3k isoforms ( xxxg1745xxx , beta, gamma, and delta).  xxxg1748xxx  appears to be
composed of a p110 catalytic subunit and a p101 regulatory

subunit (type ib pi3k) [66] and in knockout mouse studies
has been proven to be linked to heterotrimeric gtp-binding
protein-coupled receptor signaling for neutrophil chemotaxis
and superoxide production [67, 68]. while thalidomide has
no effect on superoxide production, but pi3k activation is
known to be deeply involved in this event. so far, there is no
direct evidence that thalidomide has any effects on pi3ks
activation in neutrophils.
conclusion/perspective
striking results following the discovery of its antitumor
and anti-inflammatory properties indicate that thalidomide
may be an effective drug for many disorders. in particular,
its anti-lps and/or tnf-alpha action and immunoregulatory
effects on lymphocyte and neutrophil responses may prove
useful for a variety of conditions. teratogenesis and neurotoxicity can be largely avoided by careful monitoring and
accurate choice of patients. nevertheless, its administration
has been restricted to patients resistant to other, traditionally
safer drugs, or when the side effects of such drugs have
precluded their use.

several studies have shown that thalidomide suppresses
 xxxg1559xxx  activation induced by inflammatory mediators and
prevents  xxxg1559xxx  from binding to the dna and reporter gene
expression [1] (fig. 2). consequently, the suppression of
 xxxg1559xxx  may explain the effects of thalidomide on hivrelated diseases, various cancers [69, 70] and inflammatory
diseases. although the mechanism of teratogenesis remains
unclear, thalidomide can cause oxidative damage to dna
and embryonic teratogenicity in rabbits, which can be proved
by the use of a free radical trapping agent [71]. these results
indicate that great care should be taken when using thalidomide because it may cause dna damage and/or transcriptional error in protein synthesis and organogenesis.
considerable interest has been expressed in the design of
novel compounds that are based on the thalidomide structure
but have improved anti-tnf-alpha and immunoregulatory
action, as well as an improved side effect profile [1, 72]. it is
hoped that the development of chemical and functional
analogs of thalidomide will make it possible to produce safer
and even more effective compounds to treat a wide range of
diseases. results of laboratory studies and initial clinical
