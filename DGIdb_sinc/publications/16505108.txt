abstract
we investigated the significance of  xxxg718xxx 
(epor) expression following treatment with recombinant
human erythropoietin (rhuepo; epoetin a) and the effect
of recombinant epoetins (epoetin a, epoetin b, and
darbepoetin a) alone or in combination with anticancer
therapy on tumor growth in two well-established preclinical models of breast carcinoma (mda-mb-231 and
mcf-7 cell lines). expression and localization of epor
under hypoxic and normoxic conditions in mda-mb-231
and mcf-7 cells were evaluated by immunoblotting, flow
cytometry, and immunohistochemistry. epor binding was
evaluated using [125i]rhuepo. proliferation, migration, and
signaling in mda-mb-231 and mcf-7 cells following
treatment with rhuepo were evaluated. tumor growth
was assessed following administration of recombinant
epoetins alone and in combination with paclitaxel (anticancer therapy) in orthotopically implanted mda-mb-231
and mcf-7 breast carcinoma xenograft models in athymic
mice. epor expression was detected in both tumor cell
lines. epor localization was found to be exclusively
cytosolic and no specific [125i]rhuepo binding was
observed. there was no stimulated migration, proliferation, or activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase and
akt following rhuepo treatment. in mice, treatment with
recombinant epoetins alone and in combination with
paclitaxel resulted in equivalent tumor burdens compared

with vehicle-treated controls. results from our study
suggest that although epor expression was observed in
two well-established breast carcinoma cell lines, it was
localized to a cytosolic distribution and did not transduce a
signaling cascade in tumors that leads to tumor growth.
the addition of recombinant epoetins to paclitaxel did
not affect the outcome of paclitaxel therapy in breast
carcinoma xenograft models. these results show that
recombinant epoetins do not evoke a physiologic response
on epor-bearing tumor cells as assessed by numerous
variables, including growth, migration, and cytotoxic
challenge in preclinical in vivo tumor models. [mol cancer

introduction
erythropoietin (epo) is an essential glycoprotein hormone
that regulates erythrocyte production in hematopoietic
tissues by stimulating growth, preventing apoptosis, and
inducing the differentiation of rbc precursors (1 – 3).
clinically, recombinant human epo (rhuepo; epoetin a)
has been shown to increase hemoglobin levels and reduce
use of transfusion in patients with anemia due to chronic
kidney disease, cancer chemotherapy, and hiv therapy
(4 – 6). treatment with epoetin a (7, 8) and other
recombinant epoetins, such as epoetin h (9, 10) and
darbepoetin a (11, 12), is beneficial in correcting chemotherapy-associated anemia in cancer patients, and guidelines issued by the national comprehensive cancer
network and jointly by the american society of clinical
oncology and the american society of hematology
recommend recombinant epoetins as treatment options
for patients with cancer and chemotherapy-related anemia
(13, 14). however, data from two recent phase iii clinical
trials indicated lower survival rates relative to placebo in
patients with head and neck cancer receiving epoetin h
and radiotherapy (15) or with metastatic breast cancer
receiving epoetin a and chemotherapy (16) for patients
receiving treatment beyond the correction of anemia (i.e.,
to hemoglobin levels >12 g/dl).
recent studies suggest that the function of epo and its
cognate receptor, the epo receptor (epor), are not strictly
limited to erythroid lineages (17, 18). epor expression has
been identified in nonhematopoietic cells and tissues,
including endothelial, neuronal, and ovarian (19 – 21). in
addition, several reports have shown epor expression on
tumor cells (22 – 26). expression of epor has also been
reported in breast cancer cell lines (27 – 29). these observations, coupled with the function of epo as a mediator of
cell growth and survival, have raised concern that
treatment of anemic cancer patients with recombinant
epoetins may enhance the proliferation and/or survival of

348 effect of rhuepo on epor+ breast cancer cells

the cancer cells, thus promoting tumor growth. several
researchers have examined the question of epo/epor
involvement in tumorigenesis with conflicting reports (30).
for example, several studies have shown that administration of epoetin a does not affect cancer cell proliferation
(23, 31, 32). in contrast, other investigators have reported
that epoetin a treatment can stimulate proliferation of
epor-positive cancer cell lines as well as patient samples
(33, 34).
although the potential role of epoetin a and other
recombinant epoetins in tumor proliferation has been
suggested following two recent clinical trials (15, 16), it
has yet to be mechanistically evaluated following systemic
administration along with anticancer therapy in wellestablished preclinical tumor models. our objectives were
to determine the preclinical activity of epoetin a and to seek
evidence of increased tumor proliferation following treatment with epoetin a, epoetin h, and darbepoetin a, each
alone or in combination with paclitaxel.

materials and methods
cells
mda-mb-231 and mcf-7 human breast carcinoma cell
lines were obtained from american type culture collection (manassas, va). both strains of cells were cultured in
rpmi 1640 supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated
fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml  xxxd2871xxx , 100 ag/ml
streptomycin sulfate, 0.25 ag/ml  xxxd164xxx , 2 mmol/l
glutamine, and 25 ag/ml gentamicin. mcf-7 cell culture
medium was additionally supplemented with 10 mmol/l
hepes and 0.075% sodium bicarbonate. all above listed
reagents were obtained from life technologies (grand
island, nj). for assay purposes, the cells were used from
passage 4 to 10 and were never >90% confluent before
harvesting. hypoxic treatment of cells was done in an
enclosed chamber (sanyo scientific, bensenville, il) flushed
with premixed gas mixture (1% o2, 5% co2, and 94% n2)
for the times indicated. normoxic conditions occur at 21%
o2, 5% co2.
flow cytometry
flow cytometry analysis was done on cells harvested and
stained with the epor antibody or an isotype igg2b
control antibody (r&d systems, minneapolis, mn) and a
rat anti-mouse-phycoerythrin secondary antibody. intracellular staining was done using the cytofix/cytoperm plus
kit (bd biosciences, san jose, ca). analysis was done using
a facscan with cell quest software (becton dickinson,
san jose, ca).
immunohistochemistry
cells were grown on two-chamber slides (nunc) washed
in tbs (sigma, st. louis, mo) containing 0.2% tween 20
(ttbs; sigma), fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (electron
microscopy services, fort washington, pa) in pbs for 20
minutes, and permeabilized with 0.25% triton x-100
(sigma) in pbs for 10 minutes. cells were washed with
ttbs, blocked with 10% bovine  xxxg124xxx  (bsa;
sigma) in tbs for 30 minutes, and incubated with primary

epor antibody or isotype (igg2b) antibody 1:50 in tbs
10% bsa for 60 minutes. cells were washed with ttbs,
incubated for 60 minutes with alexa 488/goat anti-mouse
antibody (molecular probes, inc., eugene, or) 1:200 in tbs
containing 10% bsa, and washed with ttbs. cells were
fixed again as above, then mounted and analyzed using a
confocal laser microscope.
western blotting
for epor, mitogen-activated protein kinase (mapk),
and akt analysis, samples were prepared from equal cell
number of plated mda-mb-231 and mcf-7 cells subjected
to either normoxic (21% o2) or hypoxic (1% o2) conditions
for 24 hours. lysates from ut7 (erythroleukemia cell line)
cells were loaded as a positive control for epor expression.
briefly, cells were grown under either hypoxic or normoxic
conditions in normal growth medium for 24 hours,
followed by a 5-hour serum starvation, then treated with
study drug for 15 minutes. cells were washed twice
with pbs and lysed directly in sample buffer, boiled for
5 minutes, and placed on ice before loading. treatment
using 10 ng/ml of  xxxg681xxx  (r&d systems)
was used as a positive control for mapk and akt
phosphorylation. samples were run on a 10% polyacrylamide gel and transferred to nitrocellulose. nonspecific
binding on membranes was blocked with 5% nonfat dry
milk in tbs containing 0.5% tween 20 (tbst) at room
temperature for 60 minutes. the membranes were incubated overnight with specific antibodies (at a 1:1,000
dilution) at 4jc made in tbst containing 0.5% nonfat dry
milk. the next day, membranes were washed with tbst
and incubated with horseradish peroxidase – conjugated
appropriate secondary antibodies (cell signaling technologies, beverly, ma) diluted in tbst/0.5% nonfat dry milk
for 60 minutes. the membranes were then subjected to
an enhanced chemiluminescence reaction using the
amersham ecl kit (amersham biosciences, piscataway,
nj). the following antibodies were used in this study: (a)
a monoclonal anti-phospho-mapk ( xxxd1355xxx /42); (b) a pan polyclonal  xxxg1369xxx /2 ( xxxd1355xxx /42)
antibody and anti-phospho-akt/pkb antibodies (cell
signaling technologies); and (c) a monoclonal antihuman
epor antibody (r&d systems), which recognizes the
nh2-terminal (extracellular) region. as a control for equal
loading, a  xxxg861xxx 
monoclonal antibody (chemicon, temecula, ca) was used
to probe the same gel.
epor binding studies
the epor binding studies were done essentially as
described (35). briefly, human recombinant (3-[125i]iodotyrosyl) epo ([125i]rhuepo, perkin-elmer, shelton, ct)
was used. cells were plated on six-well plates and allowed
to incubate for 3 to 5 days (subconfluency). cells were then
washed with binding buffer (pbs with calcium and
magnesium with 1 mg/ml human  xxxg124xxx  and
0.02% sodium azide). each well then received 1 ml binding
buffer with varying amounts of [125i]rhuepo (0.1, 0.25, 0.5,
1, 2.5, 5, and 10 nmol/l). samples were incubated at room
temperature for 3 hours. binding was terminated by the

addition of 2 ml washes (done four times) of ice-cold
wash buffer (pbs with calcium and magnesium with 1%
fetal bovine serum). cells were then lysed with 1 ml lysis
buffer [20 mmol/l hepes (ph 7.4) with 1% triton x-100,
10% (v/v) glycerol, and 0.1 mg/ml bsa] and incubated at
room temperature for 20 minutes. lysates were then
counted on a g counter. nonspecific binding of [125i]rhuepo was determined by adding  xxxd3426xxx -fold excess of
unlabeled rhuepo (epoetin a) to the binding assay. the
resultant radioactivity was subtracted from the total
binding to give the specific binding. assays were done
in duplicate with at least five different concentrations
of [125i]rhuepo. analysis was done using graph pad
prism 4.0.
migration assays
the migration assays were carried out using the bd
fluoroblok system (bd biosciences, bedford, ma). this
system consists of a 24-multiwell insert plate with an
8.0 am pore size, bd fluoroblok membrane designed to
facilitate fluorescent reading of only the cells that migrate
to the underside of the membrane. before beginning the
assay, mda-mb-231 cells were ‘‘starved’’ in rpmi 1640
basal medium (life technologies-invitrogen, carlsbad,
ca), containing 0.1% bsa, delipidized (sigma), for >5
hours. mcf-7 cells were not ‘‘starved,’’ as it seemed to
inhibit their migratory response. each cell line was
harvested and resuspended at a concentration of 2 
105/ml in basal medium. for each assay plate, 500 al
cells were added to the inserts (100,000 cells per insert)
followed by adding 750 al  xxxg681xxx  or
epoetin a in basal medium to the bottom of the wells.
subsequently, the plate was incubated for 24 hours at 37jc,
5% co2. a 50 ag vial of calcein am (molecular probes)

was solubilized in dmso, then added to hbss (life
technologies), for a final concentration of 4 ag/ml.
following the 4-hour incubation, the inserts were placed
into a new 24-well plate (becton dickinson, bedford, ma),
with each well containing 500 al calcein am solution, and
the plate was incubated for 90 minutes at 37jc, 5% co2.
plates were read using a safire (tecan, research triangle
park, nc) at excitation/emission wavelengths of 485/530
nm and a gain of 55. only those labeled cells that migrated
through the pores of the fluoroblok membrane were
detected.
determination of statistical significance was done using
the student’s t test. test values were considered significantly different from control values at p v 0.05, and highly
significant at p v 0.01.
proliferation assays
the proliferation assays were carried out using the cell
titer blue cell viability assay (promega, madison, wi)
according to the instructions of the manufacturer.
humantumor xenograft studies
the effects of recombinant epoetins (epoetin a, darbepoetin a, and epoetin h) on paclitaxel therapy in xenograft
models were assessed using methods described elsewhere
(36). briefly, female nu/nu mice were implanted orthotopically in the mammary fat pad with mcf-7 or mda-mb-231
cells (107 or 5  106, respectively) from culture. for the
mcf-7 model, mice also received estrogen supplementation. after tumors reached 75 to 144 mm3, groups (n = 10)
were pair matched (day 1). mice were given saline
(control), paclitaxel, or recombinant epoetins starting on
day 1. doses of epoetins were chosen to increase
hemoglobin by 1 to 2 g/dl/wk. group 1 mice received
saline administered s.c. on an every-other-day schedule

figure 2. [125i]rhuepo binding to mda-mb-231 and mcf-7 cells. mcf-7
(a) and mda-mb-231 (b) tumor cells were exposed to varying amounts
of [125i]rhuepo. concentration dependence of [125i]rhuepo binding to
the tumor cells was recorded after 3 h. ut-7 cells (c) were used as a
positive control. results are a representative graph of the median binding.
experiments were done at least two independent times with at least five
different concentration points.

until end point. group 2 mice received 10 mg/kg paclitaxel
administered i.v. every other day for 5 days. group 3 mice
received 0.0025 mg/kg epoetin a in vehicle administered
s.c. every other day to end point. group 4 mice received
0.0075 mg/kg darbepoetin a in vehicle administered
s.c. once weekly until end point. group 5 mice received
0.0025 mg/kg epoetin h in vehicle administered s.c. every
other day to end point. groups 6 to 8 received erythropoietic agents in combination with paclitaxel at the same
doses described above.

individual tumors were measured twice weekly by
caliper. response to treatment was assessed on the basis
of tumor growth delay with end points of 1,000 and
1,500 mm3 for mcf-7 and mda-mb-231 cells, respectively.
complete and partial (z50%) tumor regressions (cr and
pr) and survival (kaplan-meier plots were constructed to
show the percentage of animals remaining in the study as
a function of time) were also assessed. a cr was defined as
a tumor volume <13.5 mm3 for three consecutive measurements. a pr was defined as a tumor volume v50% of its
day 1 volume for three consecutive measurements and
z13.5 mm3 for at least one of these three measurements.
long-term tumor-free survivors were mice classified as
crs at the end of the study. at end point, blood samples
were collected from all mice for hematology measurements.
the log-rank test was used to analyze the significance of the
difference in tumor growth delay between two treatment
groups.
therapeutic agents
johnson & johnson pharmaceutical research & development provided the test compound epoetin a (eprex);
darbepoetin a (aranesp; amgen, thousand oaks, ca)
and epoetin h (neorecormon; f. hoffman-la roche, basel,
switzerland) were purchased commercially.
these agents were stored at 4jc. epoetin a was provided
as a 0.333 mg/ml solution (40,000 units/ml, equivalent to
333 ag/ml) and was diluted 1:10 with vehicle to make a
0.0333 mg/ml working stock. dosing solutions of epoetin
a (0.0005 mg/ml) were prepared fresh each day of dosing
in vehicle. darbepoetin a was provided as a 0.2 mg/ml
stock solution (100 ag per 0.5 ml syringe). dosing solutions
of darbepoetin a (0.0015 mg/ml) were prepared fresh each
day of dosing in vehicle. epoetin h was provided as a
0.0277 mg/ml stock solution (1,000 units equivalent to
8.3 ag per 0.3 ml syringe). dosing solutions of epoetin h
(0.0005 mg/ml) were prepared fresh each day of dosing in
vehicle.
paclitaxel (mayne group ltd., melbourne, australia)
dosing solutions were prepared fresh on each day of
dosing by diluting a 10 stock solution (prepared in 50%
ethanol and 50% cremophor el) with 5% dextrose in
water.

results
expression patterns of epor in mda-mb-231 and
mcf-7 cells under normoxic or hypoxic conditions
we observed minimal epor on the surface of both
the mda-mb-231 and mcf-7 breast cancer cell lines
(fig. 1). however, appreciable levels of intracellular epor
were observed in both cell types (fig. 1). these levels
were comparable under normoxic and hypoxic conditions
for 24 hours (fig. 1) and 72 hours (data not shown).
immunohistochemical analysis of these cells revealed
intracellular localization of epor in most cells (fig. 1).
after 24 hours of hypoxia, there was no difference in
the number of positively stained cells, localization of
epor expression, or in the amount of staining per cell

molecular cancer therapeutics

compared with cells stained under normoxic conditions
(fig. 1). thus, in these two breast cancer cell lines derived
from solid human tumors, hypoxia did not affect the
expression of epor protein. using the same specific
epor monoclonal antibody in the flow cytometry and
immunohistochemistry analysis, we detected epor expression in the two tumor cell lines by western analysis
(fig. 1f). epor expression levels remain unchanged upon
exposure to hypoxic conditions for 24 hours (fig. 1),
corroborating the flow cytometry and immunohistochemical observations.
to further show that the single f58 kda band is the
epor, we immunoprecipitated epor from ut-7 (eporpositive) cells using the r&d systems monoclonal antibody
followed by immunoblotting with the polyclonal c-20
antibody (santa cruz biotechnology, santa cruz, ca).
using this immunoprecipitation/immunoblotting procedure, we detected a single f58 kda reactive band (data not
shown).
binding of rhuepo (epoetin a) to mda-mb-231 and
mcf-7 tumor cells
to confirm the data obtained by flow cytometry and
immunohistochemistry and determine whether epor
expression was functional at the cell surface, the two
tumor cell lines were exposed to varying amounts of
[125i]rhuepo with or without  xxxd3426xxx -fold excess of
unlabeled rhuepo (epoetin a). the concentration dependence of binding of [125i]rhuepo to mcf-7 and mdamb-231 cells is shown in fig. 2a and b, respectively. the
receptor binding experiments using [125i]rhuepo revealed
no significant measurable epo-specific binding activity
present on the surface of either of the tumor cell lines.
this is consistent with our observations that epor was
predominately cytosolic and not present as an active
surface receptor (fig. 1). in contrast to the breast tumor
cells, receptor binding using ut-7 cells, a transformed
erythroleukemic cell line, showed low pmol/l specific
binding activity using [125i]rhuepo (fig. 2c).

expression patterns of phospho-mapk and phosphoakt under hypoxic or normoxic conditions following
rhuepo treatment of mda-mb-231 and mcf-7 cells
despite the presence of epor expression in the tumor
cell lines, epoetin a treatment failed to induce the phosphorylation state of akt and extracellular signal-regulated
kinase 1/2 under normoxic or hypoxic conditions at physiologic (0.01 units/ml) and pharmacologic (10 units/ml)
doses (fig. 3). thus, epor expression was present, but
administering epoetin a failed to elicit the signaling
cascades that are normally activated in hematopoietic
cells (37).
effects of rhuepo administration on the migration
of mda-mb-231 and mcf-7 cells
to further confirm our observations that epor lacks
activity on tumor cells, we tested the migratory effects of
these breast carcinoma cell lines in the presence of epoetin
a. figure 4a and b shows the results of migration assays
using mcf-7 cells and mda-mb-231 cells, respectively.
cells that migrated in response to the factors on the
underside of the well were labeled with fluorescent dye,
and the fluoroblok coating on the membrane allowed
only cells that migrated to be counted using a fluorescent
plate reader. mda-mb-231 cells (fig. 4b) migrated readily
in this system to both growth medium and to epidermal
growth factor as a single factor. however, no significant
migration was observed when epoetin a was used as the
stimulus in these assays. mcf-7 cells (fig. 4a) did not
migrate as easily in this system, most likely due to their
size and tendency to aggregate. however, we still
observed significant migration to growth medium and
 xxxg681xxx  and little to no migration in wells
where epoetin a was present.
proliferation of mda-mb-231 and mcf-7 cells
followingtreatment using rhuepo
consistent with the inability of epoetin a to stimulate
tumor cell migration, the proliferation results for mcf-7
cells and mda-mb-231 cells showed no increase in cell

treatment for 15 min. treatment was
as follows: 1, vehicle; 2, 0.01 units/

control. total mapk (pan  xxxg1369xxx /2)
and  xxxg861xxx  ( xxxg861xxx  ) antibodies
were used to normalize for protein
loading.

distinct cellular assays, neither mda-mb-231 nor mcf-7
cells exhibited epoetin a responsiveness.
effects on paclitaxel therapy following administration of recombinant epoetins in orthotopically
implanted breast carcinoma xenograft models in
athymic mice
treatment effects of paclitaxel and epoetins either as
monotherapy or in combination on the growth of

mda-mb-231 and mcf-7 tumors on day 18 (an arbitrary
day that captures both monotherapy and combination
therapy) are summarized in table 1. the response of
mda-mb-231 xenografts to the combination of paclitaxel
with epoetins is shown in fig. 5 as a growth curve of the
mean tumor volume in mm3 (fsd). the mean tumor
volumes of the groups receiving combination treatment
were compared with those of the groups receiving
paclitaxel alone. no significant differences in mean tumor
volumes were detected by log-rank analysis, consistent
with the conclusion that these epoetins do not decrease
the efficacy of paclitaxel. the numbers of crs and prs
were similar among group 2 (paclitaxel alone) and
groups 7 (paclitaxel + darbepoetin a) and 8 (paclitaxel
+ epoetin h). group 6 (paclitaxel + epoetin a) had
slightly more crs and long-term tumor-free survivors
(mice classified as crs at study end) than the other
groups (table 1). consistent with the mda-mb-231
tumor regression and regrowth curves (fig. 5), the effects
of recombinant epoetin treatment either alone or in
combination with paclitaxel had no affect on tumor
growth in the mcf-7 xenografts (data not shown).
in the mda-mb-231 study, the mean hemoglobin value
for group 1 control mice was 12.08 g/dl. all groups that
received erythropoietic treatment, whether alone or
combination with paclitaxel, had a mean hemoglobin
value >1.0 g/dl higher than the mean hemoglobin value
of group 1 controls. similar results were obtained in the
mcf-7 xenograft studies (data not shown). these results
indicate that the three erythropoietic agents were
administered at biologically effective doses. all treatments were acceptably tolerated in the studies. mean
body weight losses were within acceptable limits for all
groups and no treatment related deaths were recorded.

numbers of cr and pr (table 1), and overall survival (data
not shown) all show that recombinant epoetins do not
measurably affect the outcome of paclitaxel therapy in
mda-mb-231 or mcf-7 xenografts.

discussion
in the present study, in vitro and in vivo experimental
models were used to characterize the direct effects of
epoetin a in tumor cells that express epor. reports
describing epo and epor expression in tumors or cancer
cell lines have led to suggestions of a potential role for
epo/epor signaling in tumors (38 – 41). in addition,
unfavorable effects of epoetin a and epoetin h on mortality
have been reported in two recent phase iii studies in
patients with cancer receiving chemotherapy (15, 16).
however, our investigations of the biology of epo/epor
in two well-established breast carcinoma models (42)
revealed that epor was predominately cytosolic and not
present as an active surface receptor on these cell lines. this
was supported by our findings that there was no significant
measurable epo-specific binding activity on the surface of

molecular cancer therapeutics

either cell line, that epoetin a administration to these cell
lines at both physiologic and pharmacologic doses and
under normoxic and hypoxic conditions failed to elicit
the signaling cascades indicative of activation of the
epor, and that there was no significant migration or
proliferation of these cells in the presence of epoetin a.
finally, no tumor proliferation effects were detected
with any of the recombinant epoetin monotherapies.
paclitaxel treatment was efficacious in these studies,
yielding the maximum tumor growth delay achievable,
and all mice had either a cr or pr. the addition of
recombinant epoetins to treatment with paclitaxel also
resulted in the maximum achievable tumor growth delay
and regression responses. these results are in direct
contrast with those observed with recombinant epoetins
on hematopoietic cells. epo elicits a signaling cascade
within seconds leading to tyrosine phosphorylation of
cytosolic proteins, including janus-activated kinase 2,
signal transducers and activators of transcription 5, and
the epor (43). in ut-7 cells in a radiolabeled binding
assay, epo binds to epor with an ic50 of 138 pmol/l
and stimulates cellular proliferation with an ec50 of
11.5 pmol/l (44). these results show that epo is a
potent cytokine with a well-defined mechanism of action.
delineation of the signaling pathway in hematopoietic
cells allows investigation of the epo/epor on nonhematopoietic cells with high resolution.
recent data have shown that the epor is present on
nonhematopoietic cells, such as endothelial (35) and
neuronal cells (45), but also in tumor cells and tumor cell
lines. acs et al. (27) reported high levels of expression of
both epo and epor in the same human breast cancer
cells (mda-mb-231 and mcf-7) used in our study.
additionally, the investigators reported that epoetin a
treatment led to stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation and
proliferation of mcf-7 cells. these findings led the
investigators to propose that administration of epoetin a
may be detrimental to breast cancer patients who harbor
epor-positive tumor cells. however, the data that

support their hypothesis are not convincing. it is not
unexpected to find epor expression (via western blot) in
human breast cancer cells, as epor has been found in
several nonhematopoietic cells (35, 38 – 41, 45). furthermore, the western analysis used in their study would not
discriminate between epor expression localized to the
cell surface or to cytosol. additionally, the group has not
reported any epo-specific, cell-surface binding studies.
the immunohistochemical analysis in the study revealed
extensive cytosolic localization and very little surface
staining, similar to our findings. moreover, the use of the
polyclonal (c-20) antibody in the several studies recognizes multiple bands in lysates, so it is inappropriate
for use in immunohistochemistry (27, 46). in our study,
we used a specific monoclonal antibody that recognizes a
single band (f58 kda) that corresponds to epor
expression in the erythroleukemia cell line (ut-7). this
antibody was also used to determine localization through
immunohistochemistry and flow cytometry analysis. acs
et al. (27) also indicated that epoetin a elicited a strong
enhancement of  xxxd1075xxx  levels, a hallmark of
epor activation in mcf-7 cells. however, the data
presented did not show that the epor was phosphorylated following epoetin a treatment, and a suprapharmacologic dose of epoetin a (250 units/ml) was used.
moreover, the amount of epoetin a – stimulated proliferation was only 125%, which is nominal compared with
what is observed in other cell types, such as ut-7 cells, in
which a 500% increase in cell number occurs compared
with vehicle control (47). in contrast, there are reports of
epor-positive hematopoietic and nonhematopoietic malignant cell lines that do not proliferate in response to
epoetin a (22, 31).
the recent findings of epo/epor expression in human
breast cancer as well as in several human breast tumor
cell lines (28, 38, 39) have raised important questions
about a possible tumor growth-promoting activity associated with administration of epoetin a or other recombinant epoetins in epor-positive tumors. arcasoy et al. (29)

354 effect of rhuepo on epor+ breast cancer cells

figure 5. the effects of erythropoietic treatment on the outcome of
paclitaxel therapy in a mda-mb-231
xenograft. after mda-mb-231 tumor
development, nude mice (n = 10)
were treated with vehicle (saline),
paclitaxel, erythropoietic agents
(epoetin a, darbepoetin, and epoetin
h), or combinations until an end point
as described in the materials and
methods section. points, mean tumor
volumes (mm3) as a function of time;

examined the functional significance of epo/epor
expression in breast cancer tissues by implanting rat
adenocarcinoma cells into rats and testing the effects of
epo/epor antagonist on tumor progression. the results
of tumor depth 7 days after implantation showed that
treatment with soluble epor and an anti-epo (neutralizing) antibody decreased tumor depth in a dose-dependent
manner. these results suggest that epo/epor signaling
may be involved in the progression of breast cancer.
however, the test compounds were administered only
once and the study was of short duration (7 days),
suggesting that further investigation is warranted before
such a conclusion can be drawn.
blackwell et al. (48) recently showed that epoetin atreated r3230 mammary adenocarcinomas in rats had
significantly lower hypoxic measurements compared with
vehicle control or rats receiving epoetin a before tumor
implantation. although there were no differences in tumor
volume between epoetin a – treated tumors and controls in
this model, epoetin a – related improvement in tumor
oxygenation was independent of its effects on hemoglobin.
in another study, treatment of lewis lung carcinoma cells
in a syngeneic mouse tumor model with either epoetin a or
saline resulted in no statistically significant differences in
tumor volume between groups (49). similarly, using two
well-established, preclinical models of breast cancer
(orthotopically implanted mda-mb-231 and mcf-7 cells),
no tumor proliferative effects were detected with any of
the recombinant epoetin monotherapies. additionally, the
combinations of recombinant epoetins with paclitaxel
treatment in these studies did not decrease paclitaxel
efficacy against mda-mb-231 and mcf-7 tumors. however, the administration of these recombinant epoetins
in our study led to a statistically significant increase in
hemoglobin levels compared with vehicle, confirming
biological activity.
based on our findings presented here, we conclude that
expression of the epor in these breast carcinoma models
does not seem essential for their growth, and that
administration of recombinant epoetins does not affect
paclitaxel efficacy in our preclinical models of breast

carcinoma. however, until appropriate clinical studies are
conducted in anemic and nonanemic patients with cancer,
the safety of using recombinant epoetins in the oncology
setting cannot be fully appreciated.
