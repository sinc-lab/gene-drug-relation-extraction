summary

the ras–raf–mek–erk signalling pathway is frequently dysregulated in human
malignancies, as is angiogenesis and the  xxxg2413xxx  receptor
(vegf ⁄  xxxg1274xxx ) pathway. these kinases are therefore important anticancer targets.
the novel, oral treatment sorafenib (bay 43–9006), has been shown to be an inhibitor
of  xxxg1274xxx , raf and platelet-derived growth factor in clinical trials against a variety of
cancers, with the greatest activity to date observed in metastatic renal cancer.
although side-effects with this targeted therapy are usually not dose-limiting, they
frequently involve the skin, and consist of a maculopapular rash, palmar–plantar
dysaesthesia, alopecia and xerosis. in this report, we present two patients in whom
treatment with sorafenib resulted in inflammation of actinic keratosis, which in some
cases progressed to invasive squamous cell carcinoma. this side-effect is of clinical
importance, as early recognition is critical for early treatment and may represent a
source of additional morbidity to these patients.

protein-kinase inhibitors act against specific pathways
or proteins critical to malignant behaviour. advantages
of this approach include minimization of side-effects and
more precise targeting of critical genetic lesions. sorafenib (nexavar; bayer ⁄ onyx pharmaceuticals) was
approved by the us food and drugs administration in
2005 for the treatment of advanced renal cell carcinoma. it is an orally available, potent inhibitor of
various kinases including raf, vascular endothelial
growth factor receptor ( xxxg1274xxx )-2,-3, c-kit and platelet-derived growth factor ( xxxg1709xxx   xxxg1710xxx )-b.1 preclinical data
confirm that sorafenib has potent antiangiogenic effects,
and the current hypothesis is that this is the major
mechanism of action in human cancers.

dermatological toxicities occur in over 40% of
patients, and consist of a nonspecific maculopapular
eruption (36%), palmar plantar dysaesthesia (hand–foot
syndrome) (36%), alopecia (26%), and xerosis.2 these
effects are usually manageable, but dose reduction is
has been necessary in 5–8%, and dose interruption in
3–18% of individuals. we present a particular reaction
that has not been reported and has significant monitoring and therapeutic implications: the development of
inflammation of previously undetected actinic keratoses
(ak) which in some cases progressed to invasive
squamous cell carcinomas (scc).

report
patient 1 was a 60-year-old white man with chemotherapy-resistant metastatic renal-cell carcinoma, treated with sorafenib. after several months, the patient
developed multiple lesions, and of the seven skin
biopsies performed on his head, four showed invasive
scc, and one was an ak.

figure 1 well-defined scaly erythematous
plaques on photoexposed areas of the face
and upper extremities of patient 2,
1 month after sorafenib administration.

figure 2 biopsy of one of the lesions in the dorsal forearm of

patient 2 revealed hyperkeratosis, acanthosis and marked loss of
polarity with heterogeneity in keratinocyte size, along with a
mixed upper dermal infiltrate, consistent with a hypertrophic
actinic keratosis (haematoxylin and eosin, original magnification
· 200).

patient 2 was a 63-year-old white man who was
receiving sorafenib for advanced renal cell carcinoma.
within weeks, multiple erythematous scaly plaques
developed on photoexposed areas of the face and arms
(fig. 1). biopsy of one lesion was consistent with a
hypertrophic ak (fig. 2). the patient was treated with
topical  xxxd2339xxx  three times weekly, resulting in
resolution at 3 months.
the mechanism by which sorafenib causes inflammation of actinic keratoses and scc has not been
defined. one possibility is that it targets the dysregulated

ras pathway found in scc.3 sorafenib also inhibits
 xxxg1274xxx  and pdgf-b, both critical for scc angiogenesis
and invasiveness, and their inhibition may result in
altered tumour physiology. in addition, sorafenib causes
redistribution of cells into s and m phases of the cell
cycle, which may make the cells more susceptible to
apoptosis. a further permissive mechanism for the
development of scc may be immunological, because
in peripheral blood lymphocytes sorafenib inhibits erk
phosphorylation stimulated by  xxxd2925xxx ,4 which may allow cancer progression via decreased
immune surveillance or decreased resistance to the
oncogenic effects of human papillomavirus, commonly
implicated in scc genesis.
other conventional chemotherapeutic agents that
have been associated with the inflammation of actinic
keratosis include docetaxel, doxorubicin, 5-fluorouracil,
 xxxd2879xxx , and the combination of  xxxd1800xxx ,
vincristine,  xxxd1796xxx  and doxorubicin,  xxxd1790xxx 
and  xxxd3352xxx .5 the mechanism by which these
agents lead to this effect is unknown, although abnormal dna synthesis and a form of radiation recall have
been postulated. our cases represent an undescribed
effect of sorafenib therapy, which is of clinical importance and may also contribute to the understanding of
the pathobiology of squamous cell carcinoma.
