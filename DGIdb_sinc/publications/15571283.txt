intracellular  xxxg2366xxx  inhibition by  xxxd3434xxx  in fm3a cells.   xxxd3434xxx  (tft) can be phosphorylated by thymidine kinase (tk) to tftmp which can inhibit  xxxg2366xxx  (ts), resulting in depletion of thymidine nucleotides. tft can be degraded by  xxxg2365xxx  (tp) which can be inhibited by  xxxg2365xxx  inhibitor (tpi). using the ts in situ inhibition assay (tsia) fm3a breast cancer cells were exposed 4 h or 24 h to tft and 5-fluorouracil ( xxxd2134xxx ). ts activity reduced to 9% (0.1 microm tft) and 58% (1 microm  xxxd2134xxx ) after 4 h exposure and to 6% (tft) and 21% ( xxxd2134xxx ) after 24 h exposure. tpi did not affect ts inhibition by tft. fm3a cells lacking tk or ts activity (fm3a/tk-) were far less sensitive to tft compared to fm3a cells.
