abstract: the anticancer drug cisplatin is nephrotoxic and neurotoxic. previous data support the hypothesis
that cisplatin is bioactivated to a nephrotoxicant. the final step in the proposed bioactivation is the formation
of a platinum-cysteine s-conjugate followed by a pyridoxal 5′-phosphate ( xxxd3047xxx )-dependent cysteine s-conjugate
beta-lyase reaction. this reaction would generate pyruvate, ammonium, and a highly reactive platinum (pt)-thiol
compound in vivo that would bind to proteins. in this work, the cellular location and identity of the plpdependent cysteine s-conjugate beta-lyase were investigated. pt was shown to bind to proteins in kidneys of
cisplatin-treated mice. the concentration of pt-bound proteins was higher in the mitochondrial fraction than in
the cytosolic fraction. treatment of the mice with  xxxd439xxx  ( xxxd439xxx , a  xxxd3047xxx  enzyme inhibitor),
which had previously been shown to block the nephrotoxicity of cisplatin, decreased the binding of pt to
mitochondrial proteins but had no effect on the amount of pt bound to proteins in the cytosolic fraction. these
data indicate that a mitochondrial enzyme catalyzes the  xxxd3047xxx -dependent cysteine s-conjugate beta-lyase reaction.
 xxxd3047xxx -dependent mitochondrial aspartate aminotransferase (mitaspat) is a mitochondrial enzyme that catalyzes
beta-elimination reactions with cysteine s-conjugates of halogenated alkenes. we reasoned that the enzyme might
also catalyze a beta-lyase reaction with the cisplatin-cysteine s-conjugate. in this study, mitaspat was stably
overexpressed in llc- xxxg1757xxx  cells. cisplatin was significantly more toxic in confluent monolayers of llc- xxxg1757xxx 
cells that overexpressed mitaspat than in control cells containing vector alone.  xxxd439xxx  completely blocked
the cisplatin toxicity in confluent mitaspat-transfected cells. the pt-thiol compound could rapidly bind proteins
and inactivate enzymes in close proximity of the  xxxd3047xxx -dependent cysteine s-conjugate beta-lyase. treatment with
50 or 100 µm cisplatin for 3 h, followed by removal of cisplatin from the medium for 24 h, resulted in a
pronounced loss of r-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase complex (kgdhc) activity in both mitaspat-transfected
cells and control cells. exposure to 100 µm cisplatin resulted in a significantly greater loss of kgdhc activity
in the cells overexpressing mitaspat than in control cells. aconitase activity was diminished in both cell
types, but only at the higher level of exposure to cisplatin. aspat activity was also significantly decreased by
cisplatin treatment. by contrast, several other enzymes (both cytosolic and mitochondrial) involved in energy/
amino acid metabolism were not significantly affected by cisplatin treatment in the llc- xxxg1757xxx  cells, whether or
not mitaspat was overexpressed. the susceptibility of kgdhc and aconitase to inactivation in kidney cells
exposed to cisplatin metabolites may be due to the proximity of mitaspat to kgdhc and aconitase in
mitochondria. these findings support the hypothesis that a mitochondrial cysteine s-conjugate beta-lyase converts
the cisplatin-cysteine s-conjugate to a toxicant, and the data are consistent with the hypothesis that mitaspat
plays a role in the bioactivation of cisplatin.

mechanism by which cisplatin kills tumor cells and other
dividing cells (4, 5). however, the renal proximal tubule cells
are well-differentiated, nondividing cells that are not killed
by other dna-damaging agents (6). early work suggested
that a metabolite of cisplatin is responsible for the nephrotoxicity (7). several steps in the metabolic pathway through
which cisplatin is bioactivated to a nephrotoxicant have
recently been identified (8-13). in this study, we have
focused on the identification of the enzyme(s) that catalyzes the final step in the metabolism of cisplatin to a
nephrotoxicant.
inhibition of either gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase (ggt) or
pyridoxal 5′-phosphate ( xxxd3047xxx )-dependent enzymes blocks the
nephrotoxicity of cisplatin both in vivo and in vitro (8-13).
 xxxd396xxx , which depletes endogenous glutathione by inhibiting glutathione synthesis, also protects
against cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity (14). these findings
indicate that cisplatin is metabolized to a nephrotoxicant
through conversion of the drug to a glutathione s-conjugate,
followed by steps that involve a ggt- and cysteine sconjugate beta-lyase-dependent pathway (8-13). the enzymatic
steps involved in this proposed pathway for the bioactivation
of cisplatin are similar to those previously established for
the bioactivation of several halogenated alkenes to nephrotoxicants (15, 16). bioactivation of halogenated alkenes
involves the sequential formation of the glutathione, cysteinylglycine, and cysteine s-conjugates. the final step in
the bioactivation pathway of halogenated alkenes is a
beta-elimination reaction on the corresponding cysteine sconjugate, catalyzed by cysteine s-conjugate beta-lyase(s),
yielding pyruvate, ammonium, and a highly reactive halogenated thiol-containing fragment. halogenated thiolcontaining fragments are rapidly converted nonenzymatically
to products that thioacylate macromolecules in target cells
(17-19).
cytosolic, mitochondrial, and microsomal fractions of
kidney homogenates have been shown to catalyze cysteine
s-conjugate beta-lyase reactions in vitro with halogenated
cysteine s-conjugates (20-23). to date, at least 11 enzymes
have been reported to catalyze cysteine s-conjugate beta-lyase
reactions with the nephrotoxicants s-(1,2-dichlorovinyl)-lcysteine (dcvc) and s-(1,1,2,2-tetrafluoroethyl)-l-cysteine
(tfec), which are the cysteine s-conjugates of the halogenated alkenes trichloroethylene and tetrafluoroethylene,
respectively (24, 25). cysteine s-conjugate beta-lyases are plpdependent enzymes that are normally involved in amino acid
metabolism. however, when the halogenated cysteine sconjugates serve as substrates, the strong electron-withdrawing property of the halogenated moiety bound to the sulfur
causes these enzymes to catalyze a nonphysiological betaelimination reaction (15, 19, 24-26). the sulfur-containing
fragment produced in the beta-lyase reaction with the halogenated cysteine s-conjugates, such as dcvc and tfec, is
toxic because it acts as a thioacylating agent particularly of
the -amino group of lysyl residues in proteins (17, 18, 24,
25). several cysteine s-conjugate beta-lyases are present in the
mitochondria, including mitochondrial aspartate aminotransferase (mitaspat), mitochondrial branched-chain aminotransferase, and  xxxg102xxx  isozyme
ii (see the discussion). others are largely cytosolic, including
 xxxg1296xxx ,  xxxg1294xxx  (gtk), and cytosolic branched-chain aminotransferase (25).

zhang et al.
in a fashion similar to the bioactivation pathway for
halogenated alkenes, the initial step in the proposed bioactivation of cisplatin involves the formation of a cisplatinglutathione s-conjugate (13). the sulfur moiety of glutathione
replaces one of the chloride ions of cisplatin (11, 12). the
glutathione s-conjugate is cleaved to a cisplatin-cysteinylglycine s-conjugate by ggt, which is highly expressed on
the surface of proximal tubule cells (27). the cysteinylglycine s-conjugate is further metabolized to a cisplatincysteine s-conjugate by aminopeptidases, which are also
present on the surface of proximal tubule cells (28). both
the ggt- and aminopeptidase-catalyzed reactions take place
extracellularly.
we hypothesize that the cisplatin-cysteine s-conjugate
is transported into the cells, where, because of the strong
electron-withdrawing property of the pt-s moiety, it is
converted by cysteine s-conjugate beta-lyase(s) to pyruvate,
ammonium, and a reactive pt-thiol compound [(nh2)2pt(cl)sh] (eq 1).

(h2n)2pt(cl)sch2ch(nh3+)co2- + h2o f
ch3c(o)co2- + nh4+ + (nh2)2pt(cl)sh (1)
we further hypothesize that this highly reactive pt-thiol
compound rapidly binds to the sulfhydryl moieties of
adjacent proteins, thereby suggesting the cellular location
of the  xxxd3047xxx -dependent cysteine s-conjugate beta-lyase that
metabolizes the cysteine s-conjugate of cisplatin.
to test our hypothesis, mice were treated with cisplatin
with or without  xxxd439xxx , a  xxxd3047xxx  enzyme inhibitor that blocks
cysteine s-conjugate beta-lyase activity and which was previously shown to protect renal proximal tubule cells against
cisplatin toxicity both in vivo and in vitro (10, 11). we asked
whether  xxxd439xxx  reduced the level of pt bound to proteins in
the mitochondria and/or cytosol of the kidney. after finding
that  xxxd439xxx  reduced the level of pt bound to the mitochondrial protein, we investigated whether mitaspat [an enzyme
previously shown to possess cysteine s-conjugate beta-lyase
activity (29)] could catalyze the bioactivation of cisplatin.
mitaspat was transfected into llc- xxxg1757xxx  cells, and its effect
on cisplatin toxicity was evaluated in both dividing and
confluent cells. finally, we assayed specific cytosolic and
mitochondrial enzymes of energy/amino acid metabolism to
determine which, if any, are disrupted in llc- xxxg1757xxx  cells
exposed to cisplatin. the results of these studies are reported
here.

method of hayden and stevens (30) was a generous gift from
s. bruschi (university of washington, seattle, wa). dcvc
was synthesized by the method of mckinney et al. (31).
animals. male c57bl/6 mice (6-8 weeks old) were
purchased from harlan (indianapolis, in). animals were
housed in cages in the animal resource facilities at the
university of oklahoma health sciences center (ouhsc).
food and water were provided ad libitum. all treatment
protocols were approved by the ouhsc iacuc committee.
treatment of mice with cisplatin and  xxxd439xxx . mice were
treated with cisplatin and  xxxd439xxx  according to the same
treatment protocol used in previous studies in which  xxxd439xxx 
protected against cisplatin-induced renal toxicity (10).  xxxd439xxx 
has been shown to inhibit kidney cysteine s-conjugate
beta-lyase activity in vivo (32). the  xxxd439xxx  treatment protocol
used in this study has been used in mice by other investigators to block the nephrotoxicity of hexachloro-1,3-butadiene,
a halogenated alkene that is metabolized to a nephrotoxicant
by cysteine s-conjugate beta-lyase (33). cisplatin was prepared
as a 1 mg/ml (3.3 mm) stock solution in 0.9% (w/v) nacl,
sterilized by filtration through a 0.22 µm filter. within 30
min of treatment,  xxxd439xxx  was dissolved in saline at a
concentration of 10 mg/ml (110 mm) and sterilized by being
filtered through a 0.22 µm filter. the mice were divided into
two treatment groups. animals in group 1, the cisplatin
treatment group, were each administered three doses of saline
(10 µl/g of body weight) via oral gavage 1 h before, 10
min before, and 5 h after 15 mg of cisplatin/kg of body
weight was injected intraperitoneally. animals in group 2,
the  xxxd439xxx -cisplatin treatment group, were each treated with
three doses of  xxxd439xxx  (100 mg of  xxxd439xxx /kg of body weight)
via oral gavage 1 h before, 10 min before, and 5 h after 15
mg of cisplatin/kg of body weight was injected intraperitoneally. twenty-four hours after cisplatin treatment, the mice
were weighed and sacrificed by co2 asphyxiation. the
kidneys were removed, weighed, and used immediately for
isolation of subcellular fractions.
isolation of subcellular fractions from mouse kidney.
fractionation of mouse kidneys was carried out according
to published methods (34, 35). briefly, the tissue was
homogenized in ice-cold isolation medium [0.3 m sucrose
and 25 mm tris-hcl (ph 7.3)] with a dounce homogenizer.
the homogenate was centrifuged at 500g for 15 min. the
supernatant was collected and centrifuged at 9000g for 15
min. the 9000g pellet was rinsed by being resuspended in
isolation medium followed by centrifugation at 10000g for
15 min. the washed pellet was resuspended in isolation
medium and designated m1. the 9000g supernatant was
centrifuged at 100000g for 1 h. the 100000g supernatant
was the cytosolic fraction. the 100000g pellet was resuspended in isolation medium and designated m2. the fractions
were stored at -80 °c.
assays of marker enzymes in subcellular fractions
prepared from mouse kidney. lactate dehydrogenase (ldh),
glutamate dehydrogenase (gdh), and nadph-linked  xxxg569xxx  reductase served as markers for cytosol, mitochondria, and microsomes, respectively. ldh and gdh were
assayed by continuously monitoring the disappearance of
nadh at 340 nm (nadh 340 ) 6230 m-1 cm-1) (36).

biochemistry, vol. 45, no. 29, 2006 8961
nadph-linked  xxxg569xxx  reductase was assayed by a
modification of the method of srinivas et al. (37). the
reaction mixture (0.2 ml) contained 100 mm tris-hcl buffer
(ph 8.0), 6 µl of  xxxg569xxx  (20 mg/ml in distilled
water), 0.1 mm nadph, and enzyme. in preliminary
experiments in which nadph was omitted, there was no
change in the residual absorbance at 340 nm. therefore, the
blank used routinely to measure the activity of nadphlinked  xxxg569xxx  reductase lacked  xxxg569xxx . the
disappearance of nadph was continuously monitored at 340
nm (nadph 340 ) 6230 m-1 cm-1). all three assays were
carried out at 37 °c in a spectramax 96-well plate spectrophotometer (molecular devices, sunnyvale, ca).
quantitation of protein-bound pt in mouse kidney fractions. proteins in the m1, m2, and cytosolic kidney fractions
were precipitated with 10% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid for 15
min at 4 °c and pelleted by centrifugation at 13000g for 3
min. the pellets were washed once with ice-cold acetone
and digested overnight at room temperature in 7.5 m nitric
acid. the digested samples were diluted with water to 3.25
m nitric acid, and the amount of pt bound to proteins was
quantified by graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrometry (gfaas) with a varian spectraa-220z graphite
furnace double-beam atomic absorption spectrophotometer
with zeeman background correction. the lamp current was
10 ma; the wavelength was 265.9 nm, and the slit width
was 0.5 nm. pt standards in 10% hcl (spex certiprep,
metuchen, nj) were diluted with 3.25 m nitric acid. each
sample was measured in triplicate and calibrated relative to
pt standards that were measured with each set of samples.
hot injection was performed at 85 °c, and the injection
volume was 15 µl. the furnace program consisted of four
phases: drying (85 °c for 5 s, 95 °c for 32 s, and 120 °c
for 10 s), ashing (1200 °c for 17 s), atomization (2700 °c
for 3.5 s), and cleaning (2800 °c for 3 s).
transfection of llc- xxxg1757xxx  cells with rat liver mitaspat
cdna. the cdna for the rat liver precursor of mitaspat
(pmitaspat) was a generous gift from a. iriarte (38, 39).
the precursor contains the n-terminal 29-amino acid peptide
that targets the protein for translocation into mitochondria
(38). the targeting sequence is removed during import to
form the mature mitaspat. the cdna of pmitaspat was
subcloned into the mammalian pcdna3.1(+) expression
vector (invitrogen, carlsbad, ca) through hindiii and
bamhi sites. cell line llc- xxxg1757xxx  (atcc crl 1392), a pig
kidney proximal tubule cell line, was obtained from american type culture collection (manassas, va). the cells were
maintained in dulbecco’s modified eagle’s medium (dmem,
invitrogen), with 5% fetal bovine serum (fbs, hyclone
laboratories, logan, ut), 50 units/ml penicillin, and 50
µg/ml streptomycin (invitrogen) at 37 °c in a 5% co2
atmosphere. the pmitaspat cdna was transfected into
llc- xxxg1757xxx  cells with the calcium phosphate eukaryotic
transfection kit (stratagene, la jolla, ca) as previously
described (40). more than 1000 colonies grew in the presence
of 2 mg/ml  xxxg418xxx . six colonies were picked and grown into
individual cell lines. the aspat activity of each cell line
was measured, and the cell line that exhibited the highest
aspat activity was chosen for the studies presented herein
and named llc- xxxg1757xxx /mitaspat. the llc- xxxg1757xxx /mitaspat
cell line maintained the same growth rate as the untransfected
llc- xxxg1757xxx  cells. the pcdna3.1(+) vector-transfected cell

8962 biochemistry, vol. 45, no. 29, 2006
line (llc- xxxg1757xxx /c1) from previous studies was used as the
control (40). the two cell lines were maintained in dmem
containing 5% fbs and 400 µg/ml  xxxg418xxx .
western blot analysis. cell lysates of llc- xxxg1757xxx /mitaspat
and llc- xxxg1757xxx /c1 cells were used for sds-polyacrylamide
gel electrophoresis and western blot analysis as previously
described (40). rabbit anti-rat liver mitaspat whole serum,
generously provided by a. iriarte, was used as the primary
antibody at a 1:100000 dilution (38, 39, 41, 42).
cisplatin toxicity in confluent llc- xxxg1757xxx /mitaspat cells
and llc- xxxg1757xxx /c1 cells. the toxicity of cisplatin toward llcpk1 cells was determined as described previously (40).
briefly, llc- xxxg1757xxx /mitaspat and llc- xxxg1757xxx /c1 cells were
seeded in 96-well plates at a density of 104 cells/well in
dmem containing 5% fbs and 400 µg/ml  xxxg418xxx . the cells
became confluent on day 3, and the medium was replaced
with fresh medium. on day 7, the medium was removed
and replaced with cisplatin diluted in dmem. as in our
previous studies, serum and antibiotics were not included in
the medium during the treatment (40). the cisplatin stock
solution was diluted in dmem within 30 min of addition to
the cells. the cells were incubated in the cisplatin-containing
medium for 3 h at 37 °c in 5% co2. cells incubated in
dmem alone served as controls. after 3 h, the medium was
removed and replaced with dmem containing 5% fbs and
400 µg/ml  xxxg418xxx . the cells were incubated at 37 °c in 5%
co2 for an additional 69 h. the number of viable cells was
determined by the mtt assay which utilizes dehydrogenase
activity in intact cells to assess the number of living cells
(43). for all experiments, the cells were observed immediately before the mtt assay was started to ensure that
mtt data correlated with our observation of cell toxicity.
treatment of confluent llc- xxxg1757xxx /mitaspat cells and
llc- xxxg1757xxx /c1 cells with  xxxd439xxx  and cisplatin. treatment of
the cells with  xxxd439xxx  was carried out by a modification of
a previously published method (11). after 7 days in culture,
a stock of 10 mm  xxxd439xxx  in dmem was added at various
concentrations to the cell medium. the cells were then
incubated at 37 °c in 5% co2 for 30 min. the medium was
removed and replaced with dmem containing no cisplatin
or 120 µm cisplatin and the concentration of  xxxd439xxx  used
in the preincubation. the cells were incubated at 37 °c for
an additional 3 h. at the end of the 3 h incubation, the
medium was replaced with dmem containing 5% fbs and
400 µg/ml  xxxg418xxx . the cells were incubated at 37 °c in 5%
co2 for an additional 69 h. the number of viable cells was
determined by the mtt assay (43).
cisplatin toxicity toward dividing cells. llc- xxxg1757xxx /
mitaspat and llc- xxxg1757xxx /c1 cells were seeded in 96-well
plates at a density of 5 × 103 cells/well in dmem containing
5% fbs and 400 µg/ml  xxxg418xxx . the next day, the medium
was removed and replaced with cisplatin diluted in dmem.
the stock solution of cisplatin was diluted in dmem within
30 min of addition to the cells. the cells were incubated in
the cisplatin-containing medium for 3 h at 37 °c in 5% co2.
cells incubated in dmem alone served as controls. at the
end of the incubation, the medium was removed and replaced
with dmem containing 5% fbs and 400 µg/ml  xxxg418xxx . the
cells were then incubated at 37 °c in 5% co2 for an
additional 69 h. the number of viable cells was determined
by the mtt assay (43).

preparation of llc- xxxg1757xxx  cell lysates for enzyme measurements. llc- xxxg1757xxx /c1 and llc- xxxg1757xxx /mitaspat cells were
seeded in p100 tissue culture plates at a density of 106 cells/
plate. on day 4, the cells reached confluence and the medium
was changed. on day 7, the medium was removed and
replaced with 10 ml of incubation buffer [hbss with 5 mm
hepes (ph 7.2)] containing 50 µm cisplatin, 100 µm
cisplatin, or no cisplatin (control), and the mixtures were
incubated for 3 h at 37 °c in an air incubator. at the end of
the 3 h incubation, all hbss solutions were replaced with
dmem containing 5% fbs and 400 µg/ml  xxxg418xxx . the cells
were then incubated at 37 °c in 5% co2 for 24 h. after the
24 h incubation, the cells were detached from the plates by
trypsinization and resuspended in 600 µl of lysis buffer [50
mm tris-hcl, 5 mm sodium citrate, 0.6 mm magnesium
chloride, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2 mm egta, 0.08% (v/v)
triton x-100, and 50 µm leupeptin (ph 7.4) (44)]. for
measurement of aconitase activity, the enzyme was activated
by incubating the lysate for 30 min at 37 °c in a mixture
containing 20 mm sodium thiomalate and 4 mm ferrous
ammonium sulfate (44). freezing the lysate resulted in
variable recoveries of kgdhc, aconitase,  xxxg1294xxx  (gtk), and  xxxg861xxx  ( xxxg861xxx ) activities. therefore, the activities of
these enzymes (and tfec beta-lyase activity) were determined
immediately after suspension of the cells in the lysis buffer.
aspat, gdh, ldh, and mdh activities are stable to
freezing and thawing and were assayed in lysates that had
previously been stored at -80 °c.
enzyme measurements in llc- xxxg1757xxx  cell lysates. the total
aspat activity [cytosolic (cytaspat) activity plus mitochondrial aspat (mitaspat) activity] was assayed as
described by cooper et al. (29). the reaction mixture (final
volume of 0.2 ml) contained 100 mm hepes (ph 7.0), 10
mm  xxxd233xxx , 6 mm r-ketoglutarate, 0.1 mm nadh, and
0.6 µg of mdh. the reaction was initiated by addition of a
solution containing aspat (1-10 µl). the disappearance
of absorbance of nadh at 340 nm was continuously
monitored. blanks lacked aspartate. to distinguish between
cytosolic and mitochondrial isozymes, mitaspat was inactivated by heating for 10 min at 70 °c in the presence of
4 mm r-ketoglutarate (45). under these conditions, cytaspat
is stable. in cells overexpressing mitaspat, the cell lysate
was diluted 25-fold in distilled water before the assay of
aspat activity.
gtk activity was measured by the procedure of cooper
(46) modified for 96-well plate analysis. the assay procedure
makes use of gtk as a freely reversible glutamine (methionine) aromatic aminotransferase (46, 47). the reaction
mixture (50 µl) contained 5 mm r-keto-gamma-methiolbutyrate,

cooper and pinto (48). r-ketoglutarate and r-keto-gammamethiolbutyrate were included in the reaction mixture to
prevent accumulation of the pyridoxamine 5′-phosphate
(pmp) form of the enzyme which cannot support a beta-lyase
reaction (48). cysteine s-conjugate beta-lyase activity with
dcvc as the beta-lyase substrate was determined in the
presence of  xxxd3047xxx  as previously described (40).
levels of gdh and ldh were measured in the isolated
cells as described above for analysis of these enzymes in
subcellular fractions.  xxxg861xxx  was assayed by the method
of cooper et al. (49) except that the volume of the assay
mixtures was reduced from 1.0 to 0.2 ml. the activity of
mdh was assayed according to the method of park et al.
(36). the disappearance of nadh (for measurement of
mdh activity) or the appearance of nadh (for the
measurement of  xxxg861xxx  activity) was continuously recorded
at 340 nm. aconitase and kgdhc activities were determined
by continuous fluorometric procedures coupled to nad+/
nadp+ reduction (44).
all enzyme assays, except those of kgdhc and aconitase,
were carried out at 37 °c in a spectramax 96-well plate
spectrophotometer (molecular devices). aconitase and
kgdhc assays were carried out at 30 °c in a spectramax
96-well plate fluorometer (molecular devices). each enzyme
was assayed in triplicate for each cell harvest (44).
protein and specific activity measurements. protein
concentrations were determined using a micro- xxxd2444xxx  assay
kit from sigma or by the bca protein assay (pierce,
rockford, il). in both cases, bovine  xxxg124xxx  was used
as a standard. for all enzyme activities reported here, 1 unit
of enzyme activity is defined as the amount that catalyzes
the formation of 1 µmol of product/min. enzyme specific
activity is defined as milliunits (mu) per milligram of protein.
data analyses. significant differences in the levels of
protein-bound pt between  xxxd439xxx -treated mice and controls
were detected with two-tailed t-tests (prism, graphpad
software, inc., san diego, ca). in each cell culture toxicity
experiment, all determinations were made in triplicate. each
experiment was repeated at least three times. the mean and
standard deviation (sd) were computed for each treatment.
ld50 and its 95% confidence intervals were calculated with
a prism sigmoidal dose-response (variable slope) curve fit.
the two-tailed t-test was used to detect significant differences
in cisplatin toxicity among the cell lines and to detect changes
in enzyme activities in llc- xxxg1757xxx  cells overexpressing mitaspat. the effects of cisplatin treatment on specific
activities of selected enzymes in the cell lysates were
analyzed by a one-way anova test using spss version

11.5 for windows. differences were considered significant
if p e 0.05.
results
effect of  xxxd439xxx  on levels of protein-bound pt in kidney
subcellular fractions. mice were treated with cisplatin, and
the distribution of protein-bound pt in subcellular fractions
of the kidney was analyzed. to identify the subcellular
location of the cysteine s-conjugate beta-lyase(s) that activates
cisplatin to a reactive thiol, half of the mice were treated
with cisplatin and the other half were treated with cisplatin
and  xxxd439xxx . treatment with  xxxd439xxx  blocks the action of
cysteine s-conjugate beta-lyases and reduces the binding of pt
in the subcellular fractions that contain these enzymes. the
kidneys from the cisplatin-treated mice were homogenized
and fractionated into three subcellular fractions. the purity
of these subcellular fractions was determined by assaying
each fraction for ldh-, gdh-, and nadph-linked  xxxg569xxx  reductase, which are predominantly localized in
the cytosol, mitochondria, and microsomes, respectively.
these markers have high specific activities and are not
subject to inactivation by  xxxd439xxx  or by freezing and thawing
(data not shown). table 1 shows that the cytosolic fractions
were highly enriched with the cytosolic marker ldh and
contained low levels of gdh (mitochondrial marker enzyme)
or  xxxg569xxx  reductase (microsomal marker enzyme). the
low specific activity of gdh in the cytosolic fraction
indicates that minimal rupture of mitochondria occurred
during isolation. the m1 fraction was enriched with mitochondria as evidenced by the high specific activity of gdh
and low relative specific activities of ldh and cytochrome
c reductase. the m2 fraction was enriched with microsomes
as shown by the high specific activity of nadph-linked
 xxxg569xxx  reductase in the m2 fraction compared to those
in the m1 and cytosolic fractions. the m2 fractions also
contained mitochondria, more in the  xxxd439xxx -treated mice
than the saline-treated controls, as evidenced by the relatively
high specific activity of gdh in that fraction.
the amount of pt bound to protein in each of the fractions
is shown in figure 1. in mice treated with cisplatin alone,
the concentration of pt bound to protein was significantly
higher in the mitochondrial fraction (m1) than in the
cytosolic fraction [67.3 ( 4.0 (sd) ng of pt/mg of protein
vs 32.1 ( 7.6 ng of pt/mg of protein, n ) 3, p ) 0.0058].
the level of pt bound to protein in the mitochondrial fraction
was also higher than that in the m2 fraction, although the
difference was not statistically significant, which may be due
to the contamination of the microsomal fraction with

figure 1: effect of  xxxd439xxx  on binding of pt to protein in kidneys
from mice treated with cisplatin. mice were pretreated with saline
(o) or  xxxd439xxx  (b) followed by an injection of 15 mg of cisplatin/
kg. twenty-four hours after cisplatin treatment, kidney fractions
were isolated and the protein in each fraction was precipitated with
acid. the amount of pt bound to protein was measured with
gfaas. there was significantly more pt bound to protein in the
m1 fraction than in the cytosol.  xxxd439xxx  had no effect on the amount
of pt bound to proteins in the cytosol but significantly inhibited
the binding to proteins in the m1 fraction. treatment with  xxxd439xxx 
did not significantly reduce the amount of pt bound to protein in
the m2 fraction.

mitochondria (67.3 ( 4.0 and 39.7 ( 10.7, respectively;
p ) 0.053). in mice pretreated with  xxxd439xxx , there was no
significant change in the concentration of pt bound to protein
in the cytosolic fraction (32.1 ( 7.6 and 32.6 ( 8.3,
respectively; n ) 4, p ) 0.93). however, inhibition of the
cysteine s-conjugate beta-lyase reaction with  xxxd439xxx  significantly decreased the amount of pt bound to protein in the
m1 fraction (67.3 ( 4.0 vs 47.7 ( 5.5; p ) 0.0055). there
was a small, but not significant, reduction in the concentration of pt bound to protein in the m2 fraction in mice treated
with  xxxd439xxx  (39.7 ( 10.7 vs 30.5 ( 7.9; p ) 0.03). this
reduction may be due to the mitochondrial proteins present
in the m2 fraction.
in summary, the data show that in the kidney of cisplatintreated mice, the highest concentration of pt bound to protein
was in the mitochondrial fraction. inhibition of the nephrotoxicity of cisplatin with  xxxd439xxx  was associated with a
significantly decreased concentration of pt bound to protein
in the mitochondria but not in the cytosol or m2 fraction.
these data suggest that the cysteine s-conjugate beta-lyase that
metabolizes the cisplatin-cysteine s-conjugate to a nephrotoxicant is located in the mitochondria.
expression of mitaspat in llc- xxxg1757xxx /mitaspat cells.
llc- xxxg1757xxx  cells were transfected with the cdna for rat liver
mitaspat, a mitochondrial enzyme with cysteine s-conjugate beta-lyase activity (29). individual colonies were grown
in the presence of  xxxg418xxx . a subline that overexpressed
mitaspat was named llc- xxxg1757xxx /mitaspat and used for all
subsequent studies. a subline of llc- xxxg1757xxx  cells stably
transfected with an empty transfection vector served as a
control and was named llc- xxxg1757xxx /c1. rat liver mitaspat
is a homodimer with  xxxg220xxx  molecular mass of 45 kda
(38, 39). expression of rat liver mitaspat was detected by
western blot analysis in the llc- xxxg1757xxx /mitaspat cells
(figure 2, lane 2). the band detected by the anti-rat liver
mitaspat antibody was 45 kda, which demonstrated that
rat liver mitaspat was correctly processed to mature protein

cell lysate was loaded in each lane (15 µg of protein per lane).
rabbit anti-rat liver mitaspat whole serum was used as the
primary antibody. a prominent protein band with a molecular mass
of ∼45 kda (arrow) was detected in the llc- xxxg1757xxx /mitaspat cell
line, but not in the llc- xxxg1757xxx /c1 cell line. the molecular mass of
this band is consistent with that of the mitaspat monomer. the
positions of molecular mass markers are indicated.

did not bind to any proteins in the llc- xxxg1757xxx /c1 cell line,
which indicated that the antibody did not recognize porcine
kidney aspat (figure 2, lane 1).
quantitation of total aspat activity (i.e., mitaspat plus
cytaspat) shows a 21-fold increase in specific activity in
the llc- xxxg1757xxx /mitaspat cells compared with the control cell
line (table 2, p < 0.001). as shown in table 2, ∼50% of
the total aspat activity in the control cells is due to
mitaspat. therefore, the increase in mitaspat specific
activity in llc- xxxg1757xxx /mitaspat cells relative to control cells
is more than 40-fold.
the increase in the specific activity of mitaspat in the
llc- xxxg1757xxx /mitaspat cells was accompanied by a large
increase in cysteine s-conjugate beta-lyase specific activity
when either dcvc or tfec was used as a beta-lyase substrate
(tables 2 and 3). this result is consistent with our previous
findings that rat liver mitaspat catalyzes a beta-lyase reaction
with tfec or dcvc as the substrate (29). in the control
cells, cysteine s-conjugate beta-lyase activity toward dcvc
was too low to be detected (table 2). however, a low level

of endogenous activity could be detected with tfec as a
substrate (table 3). overexpression of mitaspat resulted
in a 12-fold increase in the beta-lyase specific activity with
tfec as a substrate.
purified rat kidney gtk exhibits strong beta-lyase activity
toward tfec in vitro (see the discussion). the specific
activity of gtk in the control llc- xxxg1757xxx  cells, however, is
low and was not increased in the cells overexpressing
mitaspat (table 3). this finding rules out the possibilities
that (a) mitaspat overexpression leads to the concomitant
overexpression of gtk and (b) part of the increase in
cysteine s-conjugate beta-lyase activity in the cells overexpressing mitaspat is due to an increased level of gtk. as
noted for tfec beta-lyase activity, cisplatin treatment did not
affect gtk activity.
toxicity of cisplatin in confluent mitaspat-transfected
cells. confluent monolayers of llc- xxxg1757xxx /mitaspat and
llc- xxxg1757xxx /c1 cells were treated with cisplatin. the cells
transfected with mitaspat were more sensitive to cisplatininduced toxicity than the vector-transfected controls (figure
3). the ld50 of cisplatin in llc- xxxg1757xxx /mitaspat cells was
126 µm with 95% confidence intervals ranging from 116 to
136 µm. the ld50 of cisplatin in llc- xxxg1757xxx /c1 cells was
182 µm with 95% confidence intervals ranging from 177 to
187 µm. there was a significant difference between the ld50
of cisplatin toward llc- xxxg1757xxx /mitaspat and llc- xxxg1757xxx /c1
cells (p < 0.0001), and the slopes of the two dose curves
were also significantly different (p ) 0.0033). these data
demonstrate that overexpression of mitaspat increases
cisplatin-induced toxicity in confluent monolayers of llcpk1 cells.
protection by  xxxd439xxx  against cisplatin-induced toxicity
in llc- xxxg1757xxx /mitaspat cells. the effect of  xxxd439xxx  on
cisplatin toxicity was assessed in confluent monolayers of

 xxxd439xxx , 120 µm cisplatin killed 33% of the llc- xxxg1757xxx /
mitaspat cells (p < 0.05).  xxxd439xxx  protected confluent llcpk1/mitaspat cells against cisplatin-induced toxicity (p <
0.0001). the protective effect was significant with 1 or 2
mm  xxxd439xxx  (p < 0.0005). addition of 0.1-2 mm  xxxd439xxx 
to llc- xxxg1757xxx /mitaspat cells had no effect on cell viability

transfected with mitaspat. the effect of cisplatin on
survival of dividing llc- xxxg1757xxx /c1 and llc- xxxg1757xxx /mitaspat
cells is shown in figure 5. the ld50 of cisplatin in dividing
llc- xxxg1757xxx /mitaspat cells was 25.7 µm with 95% confidence

alteration of the specific activities of some enzymes of
energy metabolism when mitaspat is overexpressed in
llc- xxxg1757xxx  cells. the specific activities of kgdhc and
aconitase in the llc- xxxg1757xxx  cells were not significantly affected
by overexpression of mitaspat (table 4). however, the
specific activity of  xxxg861xxx  in cells overexpressing mitaspat was significantly increased compared to that of
control cells (24.4 ( 6.6 and 12.4 ( 1.8, respectively; p <
0.05). the specific activity of total mdh (mitochondrial and
cytosolic mdh) was significantly decreased in cells overexpressing mitaspat compared to controls (314 ( 44 and
486 ( 126, respectively; p < 0.05). the specific activity of
gdh was increased (62.1 ( 19.5 vs 139 ( 65), but the p
value did not quite reach significance (p ) 0.07). similar
trends were observed for enzyme specific activities between
llc- xxxg1757xxx /mitaspat and llc- xxxg1757xxx /c1 cells treated with
cisplatin (table 4). thus, overexpression of mitaspat
apparently leads to compensatory changes in the specific
activities of some other enzymes of energy metabolism.
these changes have to be taken into account when assessing
the effects of cisplatin on the specific activities of enzymes
of energy metabolism in the cells overexpressing mitaspat.
selective inhibition of kgdhc in llc- xxxg1757xxx  cells treated
with cisplatin. the specific activities of selected enzymes
of energy metabolism were measured in llc- xxxg1757xxx  cells
exposed to 50 or 100 µm cisplatin for 3 h followed by a 24h incubation in the absence of cisplatin (table 4). the
specific activities varied considerably among different experiments carried out on different days, accounting for the
large sem. nevertheless, by comparing relative specific
activities of enzymes prepared simultaneously from untreated
cells and cisplatin-treated cells lysed on the same day and
by using one-way anova, the data in this study showed
that kgdhc (a mitochondrial enzyme) is especially sensitive
to inactivation by cisplatin (figure 6). the specific activity
of aconitase (another mitochondrial enzyme of energy
metabolism) was not significantly affected in the cells treated

zhang et al.
with 50 µm cisplatin but was strongly inhibited in cells
treated with 100 µm cisplatin (figure 6). there was a
significant decline in the specific activity of total aspat in
both the control cells and cells overexpressing mitaspat
treated with either 50 or 100 µm cisplatin. in the presence
of 100 µm cisplatin, the relative decline in specific activity,
however, was much smaller for total aspat than for
kgdhc and aconitase in both the control and llc- xxxg1757xxx /
mitaspat cells (figure 6). cisplatin had no significant effect
on the specific activities of gdh (a largely mitochondrial
enzyme), ldh (a cytosolic enzyme),  xxxg861xxx  (a cytosolic
enzyme), and total mdh in either llc- xxxg1757xxx /mitaspat or
control cells (figure 6). interestingly, the percent relative
kgdhc value in the llc- xxxg1757xxx /mitaspat cells treated with
100 µm cisplatin (15.4 ( 4.1) is significantly lower than
that in the llc- xxxg1757xxx /c1 cells treated with 100 µm cisplatin
(26.6 ( 5.9), as determined by the two-tailed paired t-test
(p ) 0.008).
discussion
mechanism of cisplatin-induced toxicity toward mitochondria in confluent renal cells. our finding that the
amount of pt bound to proteins is greater in renal mitochondria of mice injected with cisplatin than in the cytosolic
fraction or the microsomal fraction (figure 1) is consistent
with the previous observation that cisplatin is a mitochondrial
toxicant in confluent renal proximal tubule cells (50). our
finding leads to the question of how pt is incorporated into
renal mitochondrial proteins. the binding of cisplatin to
proteins in the cytosol may be nonenzymatic. when cisplatin
enters the cell, the low intracellular chloride concentration
can lead to the dissociation of one or more of the chlorides,
resulting in the formation of monoaquo and diaquo complexes, cis-[pt(nh3)2(h2o)cl]+ and cis-[pt(nh3)2(h2o)2]2+,
respectively. platinum forms a coordinate covalent bond with
negatively charged molecules such as the sulfur on cysteine.
direct interaction of cisplatin with protein cysteine residues
would explain the platination of proteins in the cytosolic
fraction in the kidneys of mice treated with cisplatin and
the lack of an effect of  xxxd439xxx  on protein platination in this
fraction (figure 1). it is of interest that in vivo cisplatin
accumulates in both the liver and the kidney (51). however,
the accumulation in the liver is transient. in the liver, the
cisplatin may be bound to glutathione and excreted from the
cell. in the kidney, cisplatin or its s-conjugates must traverse
the cytosolic compartment before entering the mitochondria.
our data show a decreased level of platination of proteins
in the renal mitochondria of  xxxd439xxx -treated mice but no
decrease in the level of protein platination in the renal cytosol
of  xxxd439xxx -treated mice. our previous studies showed that
 xxxd439xxx  protects mice and llc- xxxg1757xxx  cells against cisplatin
(10).  xxxd439xxx  forms an oxime with r-keto acids and with
the coenzyme at the active site of many  xxxd3047xxx -containing
enzymes, inactivating them (52). the work presented here
provides strong evidence that mitaspat, acting at least in
part as a beta-lyase, contributes to the bioactivation of cisplatin
to a renal toxicant.
evidence that mitaspat is a major cysteine s-conjugate
beta-lyase involved in the bioactivation of halogenated
cysteine s-conjugates and the cisplatin-cysteine s-conjugate in kidney mitochondria. there has been some debate

about which  xxxd3047xxx -dependent enzymes are responsible for the
bioactivation of halogenated cysteine s-conjugates in the
kidney in vivo. purified rat kidney gtk is very active in
vitro as a beta-lyase with several toxic halogenated cysteine
s-conjugates (24, 26, 53), and some authors have given this
enzyme the alternative name “cysteine s-conjugate beta-lyase”
as if it were the only such lyase (54). however, work from
our laboratory and from other groups has shown that
mammalian tissues possess at least ten other  xxxd3047xxx -containing
enzymes capable of catalyzing beta-lyase reactions with toxic,
halogenated cysteine s-conjugates (24, 25).
both tfec and dcvc are mitochondrial toxicants, and
renal mitochondrial proteins (but not cytosolic proteins) are
thioacylated after rats are treated with pharmacological doses
of tfec (55-59). moreover, the specific activity of cysteine
s-conjugate beta-lyase(s) capable of converting s-(6-guaninyl)l-cysteine (a cysteine s-conjugate) to  xxxd3352xxx  is
45 times higher in a rat kidney mitochondrial fraction than
in a rat kidney cytosolic fraction (60). these findings suggest
the major involvement of mitochondrial cysteine s-conjugate
beta-lyase(s) in the bioactivation of nephrotoxic, halogenated
(or prodrug) cysteine s-conjugates. in the rat, gtk exists
in the cytosolic and mitochondrial compartments. the same
gene encodes cytosolic and mitochondrial forms of gtk
(61). alternative splicing generates a 34-amino acid mitochondrial targeting sequence in mitgtk, but not in cytgtk
(61). as a result, ∼10% of the total gtk activity in rat
kidney homogenates is in the mitochondrial fraction (62).
thus, this enzyme may contribute under certain conditions
to bioactivation of halogenated cysteine s-conjugates and the
cisplatin-cysteine s-conjugate in rat kidney mitochondria
(see below).
in a recent study, we showed that cisplatin was significantly more toxic to llc- xxxg1757xxx  cells overexpressing human
cytosolic gtk than to control llc- xxxg1757xxx /c1 cells (40). in
that study, gtk specific activity was increased ∼60-fold
compared to that in control cells. rooseboom et al. (63) have
shown that both tfec and cisplatin are much more toxic to
llc- xxxg1757xxx  cells overexpressing rat kidney gtk than to
control llc- xxxg1757xxx  cells. therefore, highly overexpressed gtk
can contribute significantly to the bioactivation of cysteine

s-conjugates in llc- xxxg1757xxx  cells in culture. however, the
results do not reveal the most likely cysteine s-conjugate
beta-lyase contributing to the in vivo mitochondrial toxicity of
cisplatin in rat kidneys with normal levels of gtk. we
previously showed that gtk does not contribute significantly
to total cysteine s-conjugate beta-lyase activity (with dcvc
and tfec) in isolated rat kidney mitochondria (64). mitochondrial enzymes positively identified as cysteine sconjugate beta-lyases to date include a high-mr beta-lyase (65),
 xxxg102xxx  isozyme ii (66), mitochondrial branched-chain aminotransferase (67), and mitaspat (29). inasmuch as  xxxg102xxx  ii is restricted to kidney and to a lesser extent liver
(66), this enzyme might contribute to the heightened
sensitivity of kidney (and to a lesser extent liver) mitochondria to toxic halogenated cysteine s-conjugates. particularly
important, however, are the high-mr lyase and mitaspat.
the high-mr lyase was shown to be copurified with hsp70
(68) and contain mitaspat (manuscript in preparation).
hsp70 is known to be important in the transport of
pmitaspat into the mitochondria (69).
in support of the hypothesis that mitaspat is an important
mitochondrial enzyme involved in the bioactivation of
halogenated cysteine s-conjugates, at least 15-20% of the
cysteine s-conjugate beta-lyase activity with tfec as the
substrate in crude rat kidney mitochondria is due to mitaspat (29). moreover, the thioacylated proteins found in
kidney mitochondria after rats are treated with tfec include
mitaspat, hsp70, hsp60, the e2k and e3 subunits of
kgdhc, and aconitase. this labeling pattern is entirely
consistent with mitaspat acting as a mitochondrial tfec
beta-lyase. thioacylation of mitaspat is presumably due to
release of a reactive sulfur-containing fragment at the active
site of this enzyme. as noted above, the high-mr lyase
contains both hsp70 and mitaspat, accounting for the
thioacylation of hsp70. mitaspat is thought to be part of
a metabolon that also includes kgdhc and aconitase (24).
kgdhc activity is decreased in the kidneys of tfec-treated
rats (58, 59) and in tfec-treated pc12 cells (36). it was
proposed that the susceptibility of kgdhc to inactivation
by tfec and to its thioacylation in rats treated with tfec

overexpressing mitaspat (llc- xxxg1757xxx /mitaspat cells). the cells
were treated with 50 or 100 µm cisplatin for 3 h. the cisplatin
solution was removed, and the cells were incubated in dmem

cisplatin-treated cells were compared to those of control cells. the
n and absolute values are as shown in table 4. aspat represents
mitaspat plus cytaspat. the specific activities of the enzymes
measured in the cisplatin-treated cells are reported as a percentage
of the specific activity of the enzyme in the control cells for each
individual cell preparation. significance values were determined

sem. the asterisk indicates p < 0.05. in addition, the two-tailed
paired t-test indicates that the relative specific activity of kgdhc
is significantly lower in the llc- xxxg1757xxx /mitaspat cells treated with
100 µm cisplatin than in the llc- xxxg1757xxx /c1 cells treated with 100
µm cisplatin (p ) 0.008).

is due to the close juxtapositioning of mitaspat and
kgdhc and to toxicant targeting of a reactive sulfur-containing fragment from mitaspat to kgdhc (24, 25, 59).
by analogy with the bioactivation of halogenated cysteine
s-conjugates, we suggest that mitaspat contributes to the
toxicity of cisplatin in kidney mitochondria in vivo. if
mitaspat is able to catalyze a beta-elimination reaction with
the cisplatin-cysteine s-conjugate and beta-elimination leads
to toxicity, then overexpression of this enzyme in a suitable
cell line should lead to increased cisplatin toxicity, which
can be attenuated by  xxxd439xxx . in our experiments, overexpression of mitaspat in confluent llc- xxxg1757xxx  cells leads to
increased cisplatin toxicity, which can be overcome by
 xxxd439xxx  treatment (figures 3 and 4). overexpression of
mitaspat, however, had no effect on cisplatin toxicity in
dividing llc- xxxg1757xxx  cells (figure 5). this finding is consistent
with the hypothesis that the metabolism of cisplatin to a

zhang et al.
reactive thiol does not contribute to cisplatin toxicity in
dividing cells, but it does so in confluent, nondividing cells.
comparison of cisplatin and halogenated alkene-induced
toxicity to kidney. halogenated alkenes are metabolized to
their corresponding cysteine s-conjugates, which are nephrotoxicants. the reactive rsh fragments generated from
toxic halogenated cysteine s-conjugates induce lipid peroxidation and deplete energy stores (70, 71). the s3 regions of
the kidney proximal tubules are especially susceptible to the
effects of toxic cysteine s-conjugates (72). mitochondria are
the prime targets of toxic halogenated cysteine s-conjugates
leading to cell death in kidney cells (24, 25).
toxicity induced by cisplatin is similar to that induced
by halogenated alkenes. in the kidney, the proximal tubules
are targeted by cisplatin and mitochondria are especially
vulnerable (73). cisplatin-induced renal damage results in
inhibition of complexes i-iv of the respiratory chain (73),
dose-dependent inhibition of oxygen consumption and
inhibition of na+/k+-atpase activity (50), decreased respiration and oxidative phosphorylation, altered mitochondrial
transmembrane potential in renal proximal tubule cells (74),
and an increased level of ros production (74). these
findings are consistent with our hypothesis that the toxicity
of cisplatin in confluent cells is the result of the metabolism
of a pt-cysteine s-conjugate to a highly reactive thiol by
mitochondrial cysteine s-conjugate beta-lyases. in contrast,
tacka et al. (75) showed that exposure of dividing jurkat
cells to low concentrations of cisplatin that are toxic to cells
in logarithmic growth had no immediate effect on cellular
mitochondrial oxygen consumption. cellular respiration and
viability did not decrease until 24 h as the cells underwent
apoptosis (75). these data are consistent with the hypothesis
that cisplatin-induced dna damage triggers cell death in
dividing cells.
toxicant targeting may contribute to cisplatin-induced
damage to kidney mitochondria. this work is consistent
with the hypothesis that a metabolite of cisplatin generated
in the kidney interferes with energy metabolism in the
mitochondria. these findings show that kgdhc activity
and, to a lesser extent, aconitase activity are selectively
decreased in llc- xxxg1757xxx  cells exposed to cisplatin. this finding
suggests that bioactivation of cisplatin, in a fashion similar
to that proposed for tfec (24, 58), may involve targeting
of a reactive fragment from the active site of mitaspat to
a metabolon composed in part of mitaspat, kgdhc, and
aconitase. we suggest that cisplatin is converted to the
corresponding cysteine s-conjugate, which is a beta-lyase
substrate of mitaspat. the pt-s compound resulting from
the lyase reaction then binds to nearby proteins such as
kgdhc and aconitase, thereby inactivating them. the pt-s
compound also apparently slowly inactivates mitaspat. we
found a significant decline in total aspat activity 24 h after
llc- xxxg1757xxx  cells had been exposed to cisplatin for 3 h.
inhibition of aspat would lead to disruption of the malateaspartate shuttle and impede passage of reducing equivalents
across the mitochondrial membrane (52). in summary,
inhibition of mitaspat, kgdhc, and aconitase may
contribute to the cisplatin-induced mitochondrial dysfunction
of energy metabolism in kidney cells.
what accounts for the selective toxicity of the halogenated alkenes and cisplatin to the renal proximal tubules?
a major question that remains to be answered is why the

targeting of cisplatin to mitochondria
renal proximal tubule cells are killed by cisplatin and by
nephrotoxic halogenated alkenes while other cells in the
kidney and most other nondividing cells throughout the body
are not affected to the same extent by these toxicants.
mitaspat is widely distributed among various organs (45).
liver, heart, brain, kidney, and skeletal muscles exhibit high
levels of mitaspat activity (45). therefore, the nephrotoxicity of halogenated alkenes and cisplatin cannot be explained
on the basis of the tissue expression of this enzyme.
important factors may include uptake of cisplatin into the
kidney, activities of glutathione s-transferases and export
pumps for the cisplatin-glutathione conjugates, activities of
the ecto-enzymes gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase (27) and  xxxg163xxx  (76) on the surface of the renal proximal tubules,
and an uptake system for cysteine s-conjugates in the kidney
(77).
summary. previous studies have provided evidence that
bioactivation of cisplatin involves the action of cisplatincysteine s-conjugate and  xxxd3047xxx -containing cysteine s-conjugate beta-lyases (8-11, 13, 40). analogy with the bioactivation
of nephrotoxic, halogenated alkenes suggested that the
cysteine s-conjugate beta-lyases generated a reactive sulfurcontaining fragment from the cisplatin-cysteine s-conjugate
and that this fragment bound to proteins (8-11, 13, 40). the
work presented here shows that in the kidney, adduction of
pt to proteins in vivo preferentially occurs in the mitochondrial fraction. we also showed that cisplatin-induced toxicity
toward kidney mitochondria is associated with targeting of
enzymes of energy metabolism, namely kgdhc, and to a
lesser extent aconitase. the ggt-dependent,  xxxd3047xxx  beta-lyasedependent pathway does not play a role in the toxicity of
cisplatin to dividing cells (40). it might be possible to
administer reversible inhibitors to temporarily diminish the
binding of the cisplatin-cysteine s-conjugate to the active
site of mitaspat. this strategy may allow larger doses of
cisplatin to be administered to cancer patients while at the
same time minimizing toxicity to the kidneys.
