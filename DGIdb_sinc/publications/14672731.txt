abstract
the specific pharmacological profile of the 19-norprogestin nomegestrol acetate (nomac) is, at least in part, defined by its pattern
of binding affinities to the different steroid hormone receptors. in the present study, its affinity to the  xxxg1737xxx  (pgr), the
 xxxg183xxx  (ar) and the  xxxg730xxx  (er) was re-evaluated and compared to those obtained for progesterone (p) and several
progestins. the characteristics of binding to the pgr in rat uterus were determined and ki were found to be roughly similar with 22.8
and 34.3 nm for nomac and p, respectively. the binding characteristics of 3 h-nomac were also determined and compared to that of
3 h-org2058 with k of 5 and 0.6 nm, respectively for rat uterus and 4 and 3 nm, respectively for human t47-d cells. structure–affinity
d
and –activity relationships were studied on a variety of compounds related to nomac in order to assess its specificity as a progestin.
the effects of nomac on the binding of androgen to the ar were investigated, using rat ventral prostate as target model. contrary
to what was observed for mpa, the rba of nomac was found to decline with time, showing anti-androgenic rather than androgenic
potential, a result that was confirmed in vivo. regarding the er, since none of the progestins were able to compete with estrogen for
binding in rat uterus as well as in ishikawa cells, the induction of alkaline phosphatase activity (apase) was used as an estrogen-specific
response. it confirmed the intrinsic estrogenicity of progestins derived from 19-nor-testosterone (19nt),  xxxd2751xxx  acetate (neta),
levonorgestrel (lng) or  xxxd2753xxx  (ngm) and others. in contrast, all p and 19-norp derivatives remained inactive. finally, to complete
this overview of nomac at the sex steroid receptor levels, the lack of estrogenic or estrogenic-like activity was checked out in different
in vitro models. data from this study have demonstrated that nomac is a progestin that has greater steroid receptor selectivity compared
to mpa or some other synthetic progestins. it may provide a better pharmacological profile than those progestins currently in use in hrt
and oc.

1. introduction
progesterone (4- xxxd3023xxx , p) is involved in
the regulation of uterine cell proliferation and differentiation, implantation, ovulation, and mammary gland growth
and differentiation [1]. thus, progestins have many therapeutic uses among which oral contraception (oc) and
hormone replacement therapy (hrt), alone or in combination with estrogen [2–4]. several synthetic progestins are
currently being used in hrt and oc, and the newer generations of progestins have improved receptor selectivity,
higher potency, and fewer side effects. the overall action
of a progestin is a function of its chemical structure, its
affinity for the p receptor (pgr) as well as for the other

steroid receptors. it also depends on many other factors
including availability of the receptors, the target organ,
tissue or cell considered, the biological response, the presence of different subsets of available steroid-responsive
promoters and cofactors, and, finally its dose and metabolic
fate.
that the action of a progestin is primarily governed by
its interaction with the pgr is beyond any doubt. however,
listing the relative binding affinities (rba) of a compound
as a proof of its potency is of questionable value if given
alone, since this parameter is inherently doubtful due to the
methodological shortcomings and differences. as a matter
of fact, measured binding affinities depend for each given
receptor, on its source (species, organs, tissues or cultured
cells), its preparation (cytosol extract, homogenate or whole
cells), the duration of incubation, the tritiated ligand used
and its concentration. table 1 sums up the rba obtained for
a few progestins among the newest, together with some of the

parameters that can influence the rba determination. these
progestins are of different chemical types and each of them
has some particular potential that may be of value in clinical
practice.  xxxd1946xxx  ( xxxd1946xxx , 6␤,7␤,15␤,16␤-dimethylene-3-oxo-17␣-pregn-4-ene-21,17-carbolactone) is the first
and only progestin so far that derives from spironolactone and besides its progestational activity, it displays very
strong anti-mineralocorticoid properties together with some
anti-androgenic potential [5,11]. nestorone (nestorone, 16methylene-17␣-acetoxy-19-nor-4- xxxd3023xxx ) derives from 19–norprogesterone (19-norp), possesses a weak
anti-androgenic activity, and is not active orally, since it
undergoes extensive first-pass metabolism [12]. gestodene
(gsd, delta-15-13␤-ethyl-17␣-ethynyl-17␤-hydroxy-4-gonen-3-one) also possesses weak anti-mineralocorticoid
properties but has similar androgenic side effects than levonorgestrel (lng, 17␣-ethynyl-13␤-ethyl-17␤-hydroxy-4gonen-3-one) [13,14]. natural p and some of its derivatives,
such as the 19-norp ones, do not exert any androgenic
effect and, hence, have no negative effect on the lipids.
on the other hand, partial androgenic effect of the 19nortestosterone (19-nort) derivatives and even of some
17-hydroxyprogesterones may explain some of the negative
effects observed on surrogate markers of cardiovascular risk
[15–17].
among the alleged risks of progestins in hrt, breast
cancer risk is one of the other most controversial issues
[18–21]. it has been admitted that, according to the type
of progestin used and the dose and duration of its application, a predominant anti-growth-promoting effect was
observed in the human breast cells. that when some estrane derivatives were able to stimulate breast cell multiplication in vitro through an  xxxg730xxx -mediated
pathway, most p derivatives did not exert such an effect, or stimulated apoptosis, leading to cell death. it

has been found that a-ring reduction of  xxxd2751xxx 
(net, 17␤-hydroxy-17␣-ethynyl-4-estren-3-one), gsd,
and lng to their corresponding 3␤,5-tetrahydro metabolites significantly reduces their progestational activity: the
tetrahydro-reduced metabolites lose their progestational activity and demonstrated significant binding affinity for the
er with in vivo estrogenic effects [22–24].
those risks, coronary heart disease and invasive breast
cancer, were the primary adverse outcomes that resulted
in the pre-mature stop of the women’s health initiative
(whi) study. the purpose of the whi hormone program
was to study the health benefits and risks of hormones
for postmenopausal women. in july 2002, women in the
estrogen plus progestin part of the program were asked
to stop taking their treatment. for women taking estrogen plus progestin, the overall risks (breast cancer, heart
attacks, stroke, and blood clots) outweighed the benefits (fewer fractures and colorectal cancers). these results
were published in the journal of the american medical association [18] and have prompted new guidelines
for the use of these hormones, a combination of  xxxd2044xxx  plus  xxxd2554xxx 
(17␣-acetoxy-6␣-methyl-4- xxxd3023xxx , mpa), in
the case of the whi study.
as a 19-norp derivative, nomegestrol acetate (nomac,
17␣-acetoxy-6-methyl-19-nor-4,6-pregnadiene-3,20-dione)
is a potent and clinically useful progestin devoid of androgenic, mineralocorticoid and estrogenic effects [25–30] that
is used alone in france and some countries (lutenyl® ), or in
combination with 17␤-estradiol (e2 ) for hrt (naemis® );
it is under current development for oc. the main objective
of the present review is to gather data already available
and to concentrate on interaction with sex steroid receptors
and the lack of estrogenic effects on breast cancer cells in
vitro.

table 2
relative binding affinities of steroids related to p and nomac for binding to pgr and progestagenic effect on e2 -induced er levels in ovariectomized rat uterus

2.1. progesterone receptors
2.1.1. from p to nomac (table 2)
in a study performed by competition against 3 h-p, the
affinities of nomac and of its parent-compounds were
compared to their in vivo effect on e2 -induced estrogen
receptor (er) levels, both assays using rat uterus [8]. it
was found that 19-norp was as potent as p in reducing e2 induced er levels while its affinity for pgr was 5-times
greater. the addition of the 17␣-oh group on p and 19norp led to a total disappearance of both in vivo activity
and in vitro binding. the further addition of a methyl group
combined with the 6–7 double bound on 17oh-19norp resulted in nomegestrol (nom), a compound with low affinity
and negligible activity. strikingly, the simple esterification
of the free 17␣-oh group of nom by the acetate led to
nomac, a progestin with a high affinity for pgr and a
strong in vivo activity. it was also found that despite a low
rba for rat pgr (14% versus 74% for nomac against
org2058 (16␣-ethyl-21-hydroxy-19-nor-4-pregnen-3,20dione),  xxxd2557xxx  acetate (meg, 17␣-acetoxy-6-methyl-19nor-4,6-pregnadiene-3,20-dione) displayed the same activity as nomac regarding its ability to inhibit e2 -induced
er levels in rat uterus, with ed50 of 0.098 and 0.088 mg
per animal respectively [31,32]. it is worthy to note that
structurally, nomac is 19-normeg. therefore, as far as
rba for pgr of rat uterus is concerned, the removal of the
angular methyl 19 is favourable. the effect is less clear-cut
when the progestomimetic potency is considered (table 2).

most interesting findings was the quasi absence of effect on

displayed 76 and 85% rba, respectively as compared with
nomac. in contrast, this saturation had an impressive

effect on pseudogestagenic activity since the 6␤-methyl
compound displayed a very low po activity, while the
6␣-methyl derivative appeared to be at least four times more
active than nomac. however, this great enhancement of
pseudogestagenic activity was impaired by androgenic activity, a major drawback for progestins. it is worth noting
that the 6␣-methyl derivative of nomac is 19-normpa,
mpa which also possesses androgenic side effects
[9].
it was shown that the substitution of the 17␣-acetoxy by a
17␣-methyl or a 17␣-methoxy on the “6␣-methyl-nomac”
led to a moderate increase in rba, paralleled by a 70%
drop of in vivo potencies. the same result prevailed for the
17␣-methoxy derivative of nomac (compound 5). two
other substitutions were tried out on the molecule of nomac, 17␣-ethoxy and 17␣-formyloxy (compounds 6 and
7). despite of a rba in an “adequate” range, compound 7
had a weak po activity while compound 6 was more active
than nomac. here again, the pitfall came from the androgenic side effects showed by compound 6. finally, it was
found with compound 8 that when the 17-acetoxy and the
17-acetyl of nomac were inverted, the rba was decreasing to 11% and the activity was abolished.
2.1.3. nomac versus reference ligands
nomac affinity was compared with that of org2058
that binds exclusively with pgr and the natural ligand
p (table 4). it was found that in rat uterus, the binding of org2058 was extremely high and far better than
that of nomac. these results obtained with competition
experiments in the rat were consistent with the data obtained when scatchard analysis was performed in order
to determine kd . the affinity of org2058 proved to be
10 times higher than that of nomac with 0.6 nm for
3 h-org2058 and 5 nm for 3 h-nomac [35,36]. nomac
affinity was found to be close to that of p in both this
study and in an other where ki , the inhibition constants
were measured against 3 h-org2058: 23 nm for nomac
and 34 nm for p [36]. with pgr from t47-d human breast
cancer cell line (table 5), nomac was again found to
be relatively close to p, while results were quite different
when considering org2058 that displayed similar rba
than nomac. however, this result was also confirmed
by scatchard analysis where similar kd were obtained,
with 3.6 nm for 3 h-nomac and 2.6 nm for 3 h-org2058
[27].

2.1.4. nomac versus progestins
in our experimental conditions (4 ◦ c, 3 h of incubation
against tritiated org2058, cytosolic pgr from t47-d
cells), it was shown that almost all commercially available
progestins, displayed rba within the range of 100–200%
as compared with p (table 5).  xxxd2753xxx  (ngm, d13-ethyl-17-acetoxy-18, 19-dinor-17-pregn-4-en-20-yn-3oxime), another 19-nort derivative, did not compete at all
with org2058 for the binding to rat pgr, and was shown
to be a very poor competitor in rabbit uterus as well as
in human cells. ngm is a prodrug rapidly transformed
after intake to several metabolites among which lng is
the major one. in table 5, promegestone (r5020, 17␣,21dimethyl-19-norpregna-4,6-diene-3,20-dione) is another example of 19-nor-p derivative, while chlormadinone acetate
(cma, 17␣-acetoxy-6-chloro-pregna-4,6-diene-3,20-dione)
is meg with a chlorine instead of a methyl in position 6.
the overall finding is again the lack of correlation between
the degree of affinity for the pgr and the pseudogestagenic potency of a given compound. however, this is well
described elsewhere and related to the other parameters
which make a compound active besides its affinity for the
receptor among which bioavailability, metabolism and kinetic of receptor interaction (association and dissociation
rate). this finding is exemplified in table 6 that shows
that the rba values are to be taken with cautions since
they are rarely related to their in vivo potencies, even when
both parameters are measured in the same species and
organs.

2.1.5. pgr-a versus pgr-b (for a review see [39,40])
the human pgr has at least two isoforms, subtypes a
(pgr-a) and b (pgr-b) that have been identified in human
breast tumors and endometrium. they originate from the
same pgr gene by transcription regulation by two distinct
promoters in human target cells, and both isoforms are coexpressed, generally at the same level. the two pgr isoforms
are identical in their dna binding domains and c-terminal
ligand binding domains, differing only in the n-terminal domain that is truncated in pgr-a. in the human endometrium,
both stromal and glandular cells express pgr-a and pgr-b
at high levels during the growth-promoting phase, while in
the secretory phase only pgr-a is found in stromal cells.
the ligand-binding domain sequences of pgr-a and pgr-b
are identical.
it has been shown that mpa, p and org2058 did not
change the relative capacity of transactivation of pgr-a and
pgr-b [41]. although the degree of activation varied among
different progestins (five- to eight-fold), pgr-a was always
more potent than pgr-b. these results showed that the high
capacity of transactivation from pgr-a is not caused by a
specific ligand. the anti-progestin, ru486, caused a moderate increase in cells co-transfected with pgr-a or pgr-b
(1.8- or 1.6-fold increase) and cortisol had no effect on the
promoter activity [41].
nomac has not been tested for receptor affinity for
pgr-a and pgr-b separately, and the relevance of such a
measurement is not yet clearly established.
2.2. androgen receptors
the residual androgenic effect of some progestins, due
to their chemical origin, is one of the major drawbacks for
their use in women’s health [15,16]. schematically, these
effects can be divided in two categories: the cosmetic androgenic effects, and the metabolic/cardiovascular effects.
whether their are life threatening or not, androgenic effects
of progestins significantly contribute to discontinuation of
treatment within patients.
nomac, like almost all synthetic progestins, is able to
modify the physiological actions of androgens. however
for nomac, the interaction with the  xxxg183xxx 
(ar) results in anti-androgenic activity [9]. rat ventral
prostate was the target tissue. rba for ar was estimated
against 3 h-t or 3 h dimethylnortestosterone (mibolerone,
dmnt); two different incubation times were used to investigate possible relationships between binding affinity
and androgenic/anti-androgenic properties (table 7). in
the first attempt to extrapolate the nature of activity triggered by progestins, declining rba were obtained for
nomac and meg while that of mpa was increasing
[9]. in spite of its well-known anti-androgenic activity,
no difference was observed for  xxxd1786xxx  (cpa,
17␣-acetoxy-1␣,2␣-methylene-6-chloro-4,6-pregnadiene-3,
20-dione) between rba at 3 and 24 h of incubation. the
activity of progestins administered to rats alone or together

with 5␣-dht, on the location (nuclear-bound or cytosolic
free receptors) of prostate ar was also analysed [9]. while
mpa and neta were shown to produce maximal nuclear
location of ar, nomac, meg and cpa were found ineffective in doing so. on the other hand, nomac, meg
and cpa but not neta were able to inhibit to a large degree the 5␣-dht-elicited effect. then, since the results of
the first study were not convincing for rba as a function
of time, another study was performed. rba measured by
competition against tritiated testosterone were compared
after 30 min and 3 h of incubation (table 7).
in the same study, rba assays against 3 h-t for ar of
rat prostate showed ic50 of 23 and 21 nm for nomac and
cpa, respectively, while dixon analysis disclosed ki of 7.6
and 4.3 nm. then, scatchard plot analysis of 3 h-nomac
binding revealed a kd of 21 nm.
since then, in different set of binding assay performed in
order to check the binding of other compounds to rat prostate
ar against 3 h-t, nomac rba has been consistently found
to be around 10% of that of t (table 8) and to be associated
with anti-androgenic properties.

it is well known that progestins do not bind to er. such
an absence of binding for nomac was demonstrated in the
rat uterus as well as in ishikawa cells [8,10]. however, it
is obvious that t-derived steroids express their estrogenic
activity in vivo after metabolic reductions. data suggest

that the estrogenic potential of t-derived compounds is in
general mediated by the involvement of a free 3-hydroxy
group preferably in the ␤-configuration [22–24]. however,
adding steric bulk in the vicinity of the c-17 position may
be followed by an increase in er selectivity. finally, several studies provided structural and molecular clues for the
well-documented in vitro and in vivo intrinsic estrogenic
activities of 19-nort-derived progestins and ligand requirements for er␣ recognition. [22–24,43,44].
2.3.2. no stimulation of phosphatase alkaline activity in
endometrial ishikawa cells
alkaline phosphatase (apase) activity in the estrogen
responsive human endometrial adenocarcinoma cell line
ishikawa is markedly stimulated by estrogens [45]. in addition and in contrast to yeast assays, which do not mimic
human metabolism, the ishikawa cells, like normal uterine cells, possess the important capacity to specifically
metabolise female sex steroids and by conversion modulate
their activity in uterine tissue [46,47]. intrinsic estrogenicity
was confirmed for compounds derived from t and 19-nort
(table 9); ec50 of 0.5, 3.6 and 64 nm were found for
e2 , norethynodrel (nel, 17␣-ethynyl,17␤-hydroxy-5(10)estren-3-one) and net, respectively. the effect of net
was partially blocked by the anti-estrogen 4ohtam, which
was also partially agonistic in this model, but neither by the
anti-progestin mifepristone (ru486) nor by the aromatase
inhibitor aminogluthetimide or by an antiandrogen like hydroxyflutamide ([26] and théramex unpublished results).
in contrast, all p and 19-norp derivatives remained totally
inactive. structure-activity relationships deduced from these

studies suggested that it is not the absence of the 19-methyl
group, which can account for the estrogenic potential but
rather the t-derived structure in a broad sense (including
the 19-nort derivatives).

3. effects on breast cancer cells
the requirement for p in normal mammary gland
lobular-alveolar development is well established [48]. however, its role in the mature, pre-cancerous, and cancerous
breast tissues remains poorly defined. during the cyclical
hormonal changes that characterise the normal menstrual
cycle, breast epithelium undergoes increased dna synthesis associated with mitosis. this peaks in the late luteal
phase, at a time when circulating levels of p are the highest,
providing evidence that p is a growth-promoting hormone
in the breast. consistent with this observation, the high
p levels during pregnancy induce further lobular-alveolar
development in preparation for lactation, indicating both a
growth-promoting and pro-differentiating function for this
hormone. other studies of the effects of p on normal breast
epithelial cell growth have, however, produced equivocal
results (reviewed in [49]). p increases dna synthesis in
organ culture, decreases or has no effect on the growth of
explants in nude mice, and decreases proliferation in primary cell cultures of normal breast epithelium and cultured
breast cancer cells (reviewed in [1]). in vivo studies involving treatment of patients with high doses of p before breast
surgery show fewer mitotic figures when compared with
estrogen alone, or estrogen plus p, and high-dose progestins
are effective second-line therapies for patients whose tumours are hormone responsive. in france, where the rate of
progestin use per head is higher than in the usa, the rate
of breast cancer has not increased as sharply as observed in
north america. although cancer genesis is multifactorial,
it may be concluded that progestins do protect endometrial
tissue against the growth-promoting action of estrogen and
if they do not protect breast tissue nor decrease the risk of
cancer, at least they do not increase it [50].
cell culture studies are a means of observing trends and
mechanistic effects that are not easily obtained otherwise.
however, cell culture studies have to be interpreted very
carefully since culture conditions play an important role in
determining the results. still, they can reflect many characteristics of the original tissue such as enzyme and receptors
types so that one can focus on individual factors possibly
involved in the in vivo situation. nomac effects on breast
cancer cells in culture have been studied in order to check
the lack of estrogenic-like effects.
3.1. nomac has no growth-promoting effect on mcf-7
and t47-d cells
in growth assays using the mcf-7 human breast cancer cell lines obtained from the michigan cancer institute

and deprived of steroids 3–5 days before the addition
of tested compounds for 6 days, e2 ,  xxxd2754xxx  (racemic
of dextro- xxxd2754xxx , an inactive form, and lng, the active form) and ru486 were found to be able to stimulate
proliferation. that effect was not triggered by nomac,
mpa, meg or r5020 [25]. furthermore, the stimulation
by e2 ,  xxxd2754xxx  and ru486 could be blocked by the pure
anti-estrogen  xxxd2165xxx ,780 [25].
in a first study with mcf-7 cells obtained from the
european collection of animal cell culture, we compared
the effect of nomac alone or in association with e2 on
3 h thymidine incorporation by cells deprived of steroids
3 days before the addition of tested compounds for 48 h
(théramex unpublished results). as showed in fig. 1, nomac alone or with e2 had no effect on mcf-7 cell growth.
in a second study with the same cells but in the presence of
phenol red (weak estrogenic conditions), we compared the
effect of nomac and mpa on 3 h thymidine incorporation
by cells deprived of steroids 3 days before the addition of
tested compounds for 6 days, (fig. 2) (théramex unpublished results). two plating density were compared (result
not shown), and we showed that nomac and mpa were
equi-potent in inhibiting cellular proliferation (fig. 2); in
another set of experiments and in the same conditions of
culture, the ic50 for tamoxifen and 4oh-tamoxifen were of
300–400 and 1.4 nm, respectively.

after 24 h of attachment, cells were washed and cultured for 3 days in
the same medium but without phenol red. then, cells were treated for 2
days with increasing concentrations of nomac + e2 1 nm (left panel)
or nomac alone (right panel). at the end of the treatments, cells were
processed for 3 h thymidine incorporation as described before [27]. data
are means ± s.e.m. of quadruplicates; similar results were obtained in

of steroids 3–5 days before the addition of tested compounds for 6 days were also used [25]. it was found that e2
from 0.01 nm and  xxxd2754xxx   xxxd1891xxx  nm stimulated proliferation, while nomac, mpa, r5020 and meg had a meagre
growth stimulatory capability at 1 ␮m only [25]. however,
ici-182,780 which was able to inhibit the e2 -induced proliferation, had no effect on the induction elicited by either
progestins. since ru486 was also able to stimulate proliferation at 100 nm, the authors were thus unable to use the
anti-progestin to block the stimulus seen by progestins [25].
using t47-d cells in weak estrogenic conditions, (presence of phenol red, natural estrogens of foetal calf serum and
insulin), we showed that nomac, org2058, r5020, mpa
and neta induced a dose-dependent inhibition of 3 h thymidine incorporation by cell proliferation [27]. this effect of
progestins was obtained at very low concentrations (1 nm),
but remained relatively weak (50% inhibition). dex, which
did not bind to pgr, did not reproduce this inhibitory effect. in the same conditions of culture, e2 did not modify
the growth.
we also made use of t47-d cells deprived of all steroids 3
days before the addition of tested compounds, an extremely
sensitive model with an ic50 for e2 of 0.006 nm for the induction of proliferation (three-fold increase in 3 h thymidine
incorporation) (fig. 3). at 1 ␮m, neta, nel, ngm, and
lng were able to induce a modest but significant increase

in cell proliferation above control levels. on the other hand
nomac, org2058, r5020, meg and cpa were completely devoid of such a growth-promoting potential (fig. 3).
however, all progestins, whether they were inducing proliferation alone or not, were able to inhibit the e2 -induced
growth (fig. 4). the same result was reported for the combination of e2 and net on mcf-7 cells [51]. besides, as
shown in fig. 5 the anti-progestin ru486 was able to totally
prevent the inhibition of e2 -induced proliferation elicited by
nomac, cpa and r5020. this suggests that inhibition of
cell growth by the above-mentioned progestins occurred via
an interaction with the pgr.
a large study was also performed in the middle nineties
which compared a large number of progestins on the growth
of different subline of mcf-7 and t47-d: mcf-7 from,
van der burg (mcf-7-b, lab to lab cell line), litton bionetics (mcf-7-l, atcc, low passage of mcgrath) and
mcgrath (mcf-7-m, michigan cancer foundation) and
t47-d from atcc (t47-d-a) and sutherland (t47-ds, darlinghurst, australia) [52,53]. all experiments were
performed with cells cultured in estrogen free conditions.
at 1 ␮m org2058, mpa, r5020 and p did not stimulate
mcf-7-b and stimulate mcf-7-l cell growth except for
org2058 mcf-7-b cells and at 1 ␮m, whereas in mcf7-m cells a very slight but significant growth induction was
observed at 1 ␮m for all except p. all 19-nort derivatives,
 xxxd2067xxx  (kdg, 17␣-ethynyl-17␤-hydroxy-18methyl-11-methylene-4-estren-3-one), lng, ges and net

in t47-d-s cells, e2 -induced cell growth was completely

in t47-d-s cells was equipotent to 4ohtam. all these results with t47-d and mcf-7 cells showed that sub-clones
of cell lines may respond differently to various types of
progestins in the presence and absence of estrogen.

of attachment, cells were washed and cultured for 3 days in the same
medium containing different combinations of 10 pm of e2 , 10 nm progestins and ru486 as indicated. media were replaced after 3 days for an
additional 3-day period of treatment in the same conditions. at the end
of the treatments, cells were processed for 3 h thymidine incorporation as
described before [27]. data are means ± s.e.m. of quadruplicates; similar results were obtained in three independent experiments at least. all

to guarantee that the above observed effects on mcf7 or t47-d proliferation were indeed an estrogen receptormediated mechanism, transient transfection studies were
performed using a luciferase reporter construct containing
three tandem copies of the xenopus vitellogenin a2 estrogen response element. since the pgr is unable to interact
with and stimulate transcription from an estrogen response
element, stimulation of luciferase by compounds represents
an  xxxg730xxx -mediated mechanism [25].
in mcf-7 cells, e2 ,  xxxd2754xxx  and ru486 were able to
stimulate transcription, while none of the other compounds,
nomac, meg, mpa and r5020 acted as estrogen. moreover, transcriptional stimulation induced by the estrogenic
compounds was blocked by  xxxd2165xxx ,780. same results were
obtained with t47-d: a18 cells [25].
these results demonstrated that nomac was unable to
act as an estrogen in mcf-7 or t47-d: a18 cells, while
 xxxd2754xxx  and ru486 acted as such compounds in both cell
lines.
3.3. nomac inhibits estrogen-induced pgr

stimulators than kdg and lng at 0.1 ␮m. the induced
stimulation was similar to that induced by e2 that already
showed maximal stimulation at 0.1 nm. ru486 could not
block the stimulatory effects while 4ohtam could. this
suggests that cell growth occurred via an interaction with
the  xxxg730xxx . the effect was also investigated in
combination with e2 (0.1 nm) in the mcf-7-b cell line.
it resulted in a significant inhibition of cell growth with
r5020, mpa and most of the 19-nortestosterone derivatives
 xxxd1891xxx  nm. org2058 and net did not have any influence
on e2 -induced growth. finally, the inhibitory effects induced by progestins could be blocked by ru486. with
t47-d cells, compared with e2 -induced growth at 0.1 nm
all progestins at 1 ␮m alone did enhance cell growth in
t47-d-a cells up to 25–100%, whereas in t47-d-s cells
they did not influence growth. all progestins at 1 ␮m did
not affect e2 -induced growth in t47-d-a cells, whereas in
t47-d-s cells they completely reduced cell proliferation
at doses between 0.1 and 10 nm. again, the involvement
of pgr and er receptors with respect to growth stimulation was studied. in t47-d-a cells, ru486 could not
block progestin-induced growth. 4ohtam inhibited the
19-nortestosterone derivative-induced cell growth by approximately 50%. remarkably, ru486 alone could also
inhibit e2 -induced growth in t47-d-a cells by about 50%.

the expression of pgr, and therefore sensitivity to progestins, is under the control of estrogen, which increases,
and progesterone, which decreases pgr expression in most
target tissues. pgr protein is increased during proestrus or by
exogenous estrogen administration in the mammalian uterus.
during the second half of the cycle, as serum progesterone
levels increase, total pgr levels in the uterus decrease, and
this decrease can be brought on prematurely by treatment
with progesterone.
with established cultured normal human mammary gland
tissue, e2 was shown to markedly increase the expression
of pgr while mpa down-regulated that expression within
24–48 h. it was demonstrated that the expression and regulation of pgr were similar, although different in extent,
whether the tissue was cultured in medium containing normal or dextran-coated charcoal-stripped foetal calf serum as
well as normal human serum [54].
if it has long been known that estrogen up-regulates pgr
in breast cancer cells, little is known as to whether relative
pgr-a and b expression is modulated by estrogen. in t- xxxd751xxx 
cells, which express both isoforms at the same level, estrogen has been reported to preferentially up-regulate pgr-b
[55]. in a different study, it was reported that e2 preferentially up-regulated pgr-a in mcf-7 cells and pgr-b in

120

j. shields-botella et al. / journal of steroid biochemistry & molecular biology 87 (2003) 111–122

zr-75-1 cells, while preferential induction of pgr-b was
not detected in t- xxxd751xxx  cells [56]. again, these divergent results might be due to different subclone of t47-d cells used,
since graham et al. [55] performed the experiment with cells
cultured in steroid depleted conditions for several months
after which these cells displayed increased sensitivity to
estrogen.
with our t47-d cells cultured with phenol red, we
showed that nomac, r5020 and net were able to induce
a dose-dependent inhibition of pgr contents with ic50
between 0.01 and 0.1 nm [27].
3.4. effects on cell apoptosis
apoptosis, or programmed cell death is an essential
counterbalance to cellular proliferation and it is a normal
component of the development and health of multicellular
organisms. apoptosis that depends on both pre-existing
proteins and de novo protein synthesis pertains to all tissue
including normal mammary gland and to many diseases,
including breast cancer. the mammary gland is one of the
few organ systems in mammals that have a postnatal morphologic development, especially through puberty and pregnancy. as a consequence, the susceptibility of the mammary
gland to tumorigenesis is particularly influenced by its normal development during these stages (for review, see [57]).
gompel and co-workers carried out studies on apoptosis
in different breast materials [58,59]. they developed a
model of normal breast cells in cultures that remained
hormone-dependent. with these cells and breast cancer cells (t-47-d, zr75-1, mcf-7) they observed an
anti-apoptotic effect of e2 and a potent pro-apoptotic effect of anti-estrogen like 4ohtam or  xxxd2165xxx ,780. as
a progestin, org2058 was also pro-apoptotic in normal
as well as in hormone-dependent breast cancer cells. in
order to understand the mechanisms of these hormones
on apoptosis, they studied the bcl-2 family proteins and
demonstrated that e2 increased the anti-apoptotic proteins,
bcl-2 and bclxl , whereas, org2058 drastically decreased
bcl-2 expression and weakly bclxl levels. with quantitative
rt-pcr they showed that e2 increased bcl-2 mrna levels
at 48 h of treatment via a transcriptional mechanism. none
of the hormone treatments altered the pro-apoptotic protein
levels, bax and bak [58,59].
with normal human mammary epithelial cells obtained
from reduction mammoplasties it was showed that the cells
unexposed to any steroids and cells exposed continuously
to nomac displayed a low and constant level of apoptosis. on the contrary, cells which underwent withdrawal of
nomac showed a peak of apoptosis after 24–30 h of withdrawal. these data were confirmed by measurement of the
caspase-3 (the main enzyme implicated in apoptosis) activity in the culture lysates. the peak of apoptosis after nomac withdrawal was absent in t47-d cells, suggesting that
these tumour cells have lost their endocrine regulation of
apoptosis [60].

4. discussion
the newer progestins including nomac share the common property of having weak or no androgenic effects.
this is not the case, for example, of ngm, acting as a
prodrug mainly through lng. while nomac is derived
from 19-norprogesterone, ngm, lng and the older neta
are 19-nortestosterone derivatives, and belong to the subgroup of 13-ethyl-gonanes with an ethinyl group at c17
alpha. besides their androgenic side effects related to their
structural origin, these compounds are also metabolised
to compounds that bind er and hence display estrogenic
activity [23,25,61]. however, if most progesterone and
19-norprogesterone derivatives have no androgenic property, some p derivatives like mpa do have some. actually,
with regard to the cardiovascular protective effects of estrogen, the absence of nomac deleterious effects on vascular
responses were evaluated in two models of coronary vascular reactivity in primates: (1) clarkson’s model [62] of
the paradoxical vasoconstriction to acethylcholine coronary
infusion after 5 months of mildly atherogenic diet in ovx
cynomolgus monkeys and (2) hermsmeyer’s model [63]
of the pharmacologically evoked coronary vasospasm in the
ovx rhesus monkey [64,65]. again, opposite to progestins
with androgenic properties nomac has been shown to not
diminish the beneficial effects of estrogen on plasma lipid
and lipoprotein concentrations [66–68] and did not affect
glucose tolerance in women [69,70].
altogether our results demonstrate that (1) with regards to
breast cancer risk the production of estrogenic metabolites
and not the lack of a 19-methyl is the major determinant for
estrogenic activity in 19-norprogestins (2) with regard to the
cardiovascular risk, due to the absence of androgenicity nomac appears neutral on metabolic factors and on the vessels and may reduce incidences in which women experience
symptoms of androgenization, such as acne and seborrhoea.
to sum up, a progestin free of androgenic and estrogenic
side effects present an outstanding advantage for hormonal
treatment of menopause as well as for oral contraception as
compared with progestins that present one or the other, or
worse, both side effects. data from this study have demonstrated that nomac is a progestin that has greater steroid
receptor selectivity compared to mpa or some other synthetic progestins. it may provide a better pharmacological
profile than those progestins currently in use in hrt and oc.
complying with the classic contra indications of hormonal
treatment and selecting molecules devoid of estrogenic,
androgenic, but also glucocorticoid effects should allow a
larger use of the progestins without any major shortcoming.
