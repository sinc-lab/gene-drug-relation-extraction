abstract
objective: new  xxxg1645xxx  inhibitors, classified as oral (prasugrel and
 xxxd3373xxx ) and intravenous ( xxxd423xxx  and elinogrel) drugs, have shown
improved antithrombotic effects compared with clopidogrel in patients with
acute coronary syndrome (acs) or patients undergoing percutaneous
coronary intervention (pci) in landmark trials. the purpose of this study
was to perform a meta-analysis of randomized trials that compared new
 xxxg1645xxx  inhibitors with clopidogrel to determine their efficacy and safety in
patients undergoing pci.
methods: randomized controlled trials of at least 4 weeks, comparing new
 xxxg1645xxx  inhibitors with clopidogrel in pci, were identified using the electronic databases such as cochrane
central register of controlled trials, medline, pubmed, web of science, and google scholar from january 1,
1980, to july 31, 2014.
main outcome measures: primary efficacy endpoint was all-cause death and major adverse cardiovascular
events (maces). primary safety endpoint was thrombolysis in myocardial infarction (timi) major bleeding.
results: twelve studies including 71,097 patients met the inclusion criteria. new  xxxg1645xxx  inhibitors significantly
reduced all-cause death (odds ratio [or]: 0.81; 95% confidence interval [ci] 0.73–0.90, p<0.0001), mace (or
0.81; 95% ci 0.73–0.90, p<0.0001), stent thrombosis (or 0.58; 95% ci 0.49–0.69, p<0.00001), myocardial
infarction (or 0.87; 95% ci 0.76–0.99, p = 0.03) and cardiovascular death (or 0.82; 95% ci 0.73–0.92, p =
0.001) as compared with clopidogrel. there were no significant differences between stroke (or 0.87; 95% ci
0.72–1.05, p = 0.14) and major bleeding events (or 1.22; 95% ci 0.99–1.52, p = 0.06) between the new
 xxxg1645xxx  inhibitors and clopidogrel groups.
conclusion: new  xxxg1645xxx  inhibitors decreased death in patients undergoing pci compared with clopidogrel with
a considerable safety and tolerability profile; however, the risk/benefit ratio of ischemic and bleeding events
should be further investigated.

introduction
dual antiplatelet therapy with aspirin and a  xxxg1645xxx  receptor antagonist is the mainstay in the
treatment of patients with acute coronary syndrome (acs) or patients undergoing
percutaneous coronary intervention (pci). clopidogrel, as the key  xxxg1645xxx  antagonist
advocated, can effectively reduce the composite risk for death, myocardial infarction (mi),
and stent thrombosis. despite its proven efficacy, clinical benefits, and superior tolerability,

downloaded by [university of arizona] at 00:17 29 september 2015

safety, and side-effect profile, there are certain limitations associated with it1,2. antiplatelet
effects of clopidogrel are deferred due to metabolism of the prodrug; moreover, interindividual differences in the level of metabolism of the prodrug result in substantial interindividual variability in platelet inhibition, which is a clinically relevant concern. other
limitations include irreversible effect and delayed onset of action2. in addition, clopidogrel is
not suitable in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass graft (cabg) surgery as it
irreversibly inhibits  xxxg1645xxx  and causes bleeding complications and associated problems3.
however, statistics have shown that approximately 20% to 30% of patients did not achieve
effective levels of platelet inhibition while taking clopidogrel, a condition known as
clopidogrel resistance3-5. nonetheless, tailoring of dosing in routine care is not
recommended5. all these attributes of clopidogrel corresponds to the increased risk of stent
thrombosis and ischemic events in poorly responsive patients5.
the aforementioned limitations have fostered the development of new  xxxg1645xxx  antagonists.
these recently developed receptor antagonists have more powerful, rapid onset of action and
potent effects on platelet aggregation as compared with clopidogrel. these characteristics of
 xxxg1645xxx  receptor antagonists are drawing interest of physicians for their use in optimizing the
treatment strategy of pci. each new  xxxg1645xxx  receptor antagonist has its own unique
characteristics and differs from the other. for instance, prasugrel is an oral irreversible  xxxg1645xxx 
receptor antagonist with more consistent inhibitory effects compared with clopidogrel3,6.

some of the advantages of prasugrel are maximal plasma concentration in lesser time, faster
and greater mean inhibition of platelet function, no involvement of cytochrome p (cyp)
genotype, and lower inter-individual variability in the inhibition of  xxxg1645xxx .  xxxd3373xxx  can
competitively combine with  xxxg1645xxx  receptors, but is less potent than  xxxd423xxx  and exerts a
reversible antiplatelet effect3,7. it is more advantageous in patients undergoing cabg than
those on treatment with clopidogrel; however, it is associated with higher incidences of
dyspnea.  xxxd423xxx , an atp analogue is an intravenous reversible competitive antagonist of

downloaded by [university of arizona] at 00:17 29 september 2015

 xxxg1645xxx  receptor and is a potent inhibitor of  xxxd80xxx  -induced aggregation of
platelets. it does not require hepatic transformation and has a short half-life of 3 to 6 minutes
with rapid onset of action, thereby causing platelet inhibition to highest extent. moreover, on
discontinuation of treatment, it has rapid offset effect, thereby normalizing the platelet
function. it is important in emergency pci cases where rapid antiplatelet effect with minimal
increase in bleeding is needed3, 8. elinogrel is a direct-acting, reversible  xxxg1645xxx  inhibitor that
can be administered both orally and intravenously3,9 (table 1). studies have suggested that
elinogrel is well absorbed and causes no serious or clinically significant adverse events3. in
line with the recommendations of the european guidelines, large-scale randomized trials
demonstrated that the clinical benefit of these agents is better than clopidogrel. henceforth,
prasugrel and  xxxd3373xxx  are now the recommended first-line agents in patients with non-st
segment elevation acs and st-segment elevation acs. however, role of platelet function
assays to prevent bleeding complications in case of novel  xxxg1645xxx  is yet to be established10.
this meta-analysis reviewed the relevant clinical trials comparing the effects of new  xxxg1645xxx 
inhibitors with that of clopidogrel to investigate the impact of new  xxxg1645xxx  receptor inhibitors
on improving clinical outcomes among pci-treated patients compared with clopidogreltreated patients.

methods
study selection
this review included data from all the relevant clinical trials comparing the effects of new
 xxxg1645xxx  inhibitors with that of clopidogrel. the analysis included only the trials that met all the
following inclusion criteria: randomized controlled trials of at least 4 weeks of duration that
compared new  xxxg1645xxx  inhibitors with clopidogrel in patients undergoing pci; trials with a

downloaded by [university of arizona] at 00:17 29 september 2015

study population comprising patients with coronary disease, with pci performed at least in a
majority of the population (60%); trails with the reference treatment being clopidogrel and
the endpoints being ischemic events, including all-cause death, major adverse cardiovascular
events (maces), mi, cardiovascular (cv) death, stent thrombosis, and/or stroke; and trails
that used the thrombolysis in myocardial infarction (timi) criteria to classify the bleeding
events.
search criteria
published studies were identified using the electronic databases such as cochrane central
register of controlled trials, medline, pubmed, web of science, and google scholar
independently from january 1, 1980, to july 31, 2014, with no language restriction. in
addition, reference lists of pertinent studies and reviews, editorials, and letters on this topic
were also searched. full-text articles, substudies, and meeting abstracts were all included.
the search strategy included the terms “new  xxxg1645xxx  inhibitors” or “prasugrel” or
“ xxxd3373xxx ” or “ xxxd423xxx ” or “elinogrel” and “acute coronary syndrome” or
“percutaneous coronary intervention” and “clopidogrel” and “randomized controlled
trial.” screening, quality evaluation, and data mining of studies, which are included in this
review, were independently performed by two reviewers.

data extraction
data extraction included: (1) study name, year of publication, design, study population (e.g.,
number, age, sex); (2) intervention inclusive of the style, dose of antiplatelet agents; and (3)
completeness of follow-up and the results of clinical outcomes.
outcome measures
the primary efficacy endpoints included all-cause death (death), mace, mi, cv death, and

downloaded by [university of arizona] at 00:17 29 september 2015

stroke. the primary safety endpoints included stent thrombosis (diagnosis is based on the
association's guide11, including the confirmed and possible stent thrombosis-related events),
and timi after bleeding, which was defined according to the timi criteria. all endpoints
were considered at the longest follow-up available in each study (table 1). only data from
intention-to-treat cohorts were used for this meta-analysis.
assessment of risk of bias in the included studies
two reviewers independently, but without being blinded to the authors or journals, assessed
the risk of bias in the studies fulfilling the inclusion criteria. the cochrane collaboration’s
tool was used to estimate the risk of bias, which includes the following criteria:
appropriateness of sequence generation; allocation concealment; blinding of participants,
personnel, and outcome assessors; incomplete outcome results addressed; free of selective
outcome reporting; and free of other sources of bias. in all cases, an answer “yes” indicates a
low risk of bias, and an answer of “no” indicates a high risk of bias.
assessment of heterogeneity
heterogeneity was measured by q-statistics, where p<0.05 was considered as significant for
showing heterogeneity. heterogeneity is interpreted as the percentage of the total variation
among studies that contributes to heterogeneity rather than to chance. a value of 0% is

indicative of no observed heterogeneity, and larger values show increasing heterogeneity. if
there was a noticeable heterogeneity (over 50%), both fixed- and random-effects models were
used for confirming the pooled results. in the forest plot, only the fixed-effects model is
shown. i2 values were used to measure the heterogeneity. to test for publication bias, funnel
plot analyses were used.
statistical analysis

the statistical analysis was performed using revman, version 5.2 (the nordic cochrane
centre, the cochrane collaboration, copenhagen, denmark), a software used for performing
meta-analyses12-14. quantitative data were pooled together in the form of standardized mean
difference with 95% confidence interval (ci), and, in the case of qualitative data, it was odds
ratio (or) with 95% ci.
results
characteristics of the studies
altogether, 10 double-blind rcts 9,15-23 involving 71,097 patients, out of whom 94.7%
underwent pci, were included in the analysis. five studies compared new oral  xxxg1645xxx 
inhibitors (prasugrel and  xxxd3373xxx ) with clopidogrel 17,19,20,22,23, and the other five compared
new intravenous  xxxg1645xxx  inhibitors ( xxxd423xxx  and elinogrel) with clopidogrel 9,15,16,18,21. three
studies tested  xxxd423xxx  15,16,18, two studies tested elinogrel 9,21, four studies tested prasugrel
17,19,22,23

, and one study tested  xxxd3373xxx  20. a flowchart of the meta-analysis is shown in

figure 1. details of the design of the included studies are presented in table 2. the
methodological quality of the evaluation results are listed in table 3.
new  xxxg1645xxx  inhibitors versus clopidogrel in pci-treated patients
primary efficacy endpoints:

all-cause death:
ten studies 9, 15-23 reported the incidence of all-cause death in pci-treated patients taking new
 xxxg1645xxx  inhibitors. no heterogeneity was observed (p = 0.10, i2 = 41%). fixed-effects model
was used for the analysis. the incidence of all-cause mortality was 2.74% for the clopidogrel
group, while it was 2.18% for the new  xxxg1645xxx  receptor antagonist group, indicating a
significant decrease by 19% (or 0.81; 95% ci 0.73–0.90, p<0.0001) (figure 2).

maces
ten studies 9, 15-23 reported incidences of maces in pci patients with test for heterogeneity
(p = 0.008, i2 = 60%). according to the random-effects model, a significant decrease of 15%
(from 8.04% to 9.39%) was observed in the incidence of mace (or 0.85; 95% ci 0.76–
0.96, p = 0.009; figure 3). by subgroup analysis, eight experiments 9, 15, 16, 18, 20-23 analyzed
the effects of the new antiplatelet drugs on mi risk. heterogeneity observed was p = 0.01,
incidences of mi significantly decreased by 13% from 6.91% with clopidogrel to 5.92% with
the new  xxxg1645xxx  inhibitors (or 0.87; 95% ci 0.76–0.99, p = 0.03) (figure 4). five studies16, 19,
20, 22, 23

discussed cv death, wherein heterogeneity was not observed (p = 0.64, i2 = 0%). the

fixed-effects model analysis showed that the new  xxxg1645xxx  receptor antagonists can significantly
decrease the incidence of cv death by 18% (or 0.82; 95% ci 0.73–0.92, p = 0.001; figure
5). seven studies 9, 15, 18, 20-23 compared the risk of stroke associated with different antiplatelet
drugs, and no heterogeneity was observed (p = 0.68, i2 = 0%). according to the fixed-effects
model, there was no difference in the risk of stroke between the new  xxxg1645xxx  inhibitors
(0.86%) and clopidogrel (1.00%) (or 0.87; 95% ci 0.72–1.05, p = 0.14; figure 6).
primary safety endpoints
stent thrombosis

nine trials 15-23 were included in the analysis of stent thrombosis, which compared the new
 xxxg1645xxx  receptor antagonist with placebo. there was no heterogeneity (p = 0.10, i2 = 42%). the
fixed-effects model analysis showed a significant decrease of 42% in the incidence of stent
thrombosis, from 1.47% with placebo to 0.86% with the new  xxxg1645xxx  receptor antagonist (or
0.58; 95% ci 0.49–0.69, p<0.00001; figure 7). these results demonstrated the superiority of
the new  xxxg1645xxx  receptor antagonist over clopidogrel in the prevention of stent thrombosis after

pci.
timi major bleeding
nine studies9,15-19,21-23 were included in the analysis of timi major bleeding events; there was
no heterogeneity (p = 0.53, i2 = 0%). the fixed-effects model analysis indicated no
significant difference in major bleeding events between the groups, with an incidence of
0.91% with the new  xxxg1645xxx  inhibitors compared with 0.78% with clopidogrel (or 1.22; 95%
ci 0.99–1.52, p = 0.06; figure 8).
publication bias
funnel plot demonstrated that one study (infuse) exceeded 95% ci. significant funnel plot
asymmetry suggested a possibility of some selection bias or publication bias (figure 9).
discussion
this meta-analysis suggests that new  xxxg1645xxx  receptor inhibitors could significantly reduce the
incidence of major ischemic events (all-cause death, maces, mi, cv death, and stent
thrombosis) compared with clopidogrel in patients undergoing pci. there were no
differences in the risks of stroke and timi major bleeding events between the new  xxxg1645xxx 
receptor inhibitors and clopidogrel.

dual antiplatelet therapy included clopidogrel with aspirin, which is the mainstay in the
treatment of patients with acs or patients undergoing pci. in a study conducted by the
commit collaborative group, clopidogrel group demonstrated decreased incidence of death,
mi, and stroke of approximately 9% than the placebo group; however, there was no
difference in the bleeding events (p = 0.59)24. in a subgroup of the pci-cure study,
clopidogrel therapy after pci could significantly reduce the incidence of death, mi, and
revascularization (25.3% vs 28.9%, p = 0.03); there was no difference in the bleeding events

downloaded by [university of arizona] at 00:17 29 september 2015

(1.1% vs 1.1%, p = 0.98)25. however, delayed onset of action, irreversible platelet inhibition,
and inter-individual variability are some of the key limitations associated with clopidogrel.
some studies suggested that loading doses of clopidogrel are inversely proportional to
platelet inhibition and inter-individual variability, thereby decreasing incidences of major
ischemic events with no detectable effect on survival26.
the new  xxxg1645xxx  inhibitors have a more predictable response, greater potency and faster onset
of characteristics, thus making them the treatment of choice in patients undergoing pci. new
oral  xxxg1645xxx  inhibitors (prasugrel and  xxxd3373xxx ) have evidentially been recommended for the
treatment of nste-acs and st-segment elevation myocardial infarction (stemi)6, as they
showed a reduction in cv events compared with clopidogrel. however, new  xxxg1645xxx 
intravenous inhibitors ( xxxd423xxx  and elinogrel) have even more rapid onset and offset of
action compared with oral agents. bellemain-appaix a et al., demonstrated that new  xxxg1645xxx 
receptor inhibitors can decrease the incidences of all-cause death, mace, and stent
thrombosis by 15%, 13%, and 40%, respectively, in patients undergoing pci as compared
with clopidogrel, with no difference in the risk of stroke (0.72% vs 1.0%, p = 0.62); however,
there was a relative increase in the incidence of bleeding events (1.56% vs 1.28%, p = 0.01).
similarly, in patients with stemi undergoing pci, the new  xxxg1645xxx  receptor inhibitors
significantly decreased the incidences of all-cause mortality, mace, and stent thrombosis by

22%, 16%, and 33%, respectively. there was an increase in the incidence of stroke (1.54% vs
1.13%, p = 0.02), with no difference in bleeding events (4.89% vs 4.78%, p = 1.0)27.
prasugrel is a third-generation thienopyridine drug that exerts more rapid and consistent
inhibitory effects on platelet aggregation compared with clopidogrel. in the triton-timi38
study 23, which conducted a comprehensive comparison of prasugrel with clopidogrel, the
incidences of the primary endpoints such as cv death, nonfatal mi, and nonfatal stroke were

downloaded by [university of arizona] at 00:17 29 september 2015

12.1% and 9.9% in the prasugrel and clopidogrel groups, respectively (hazard ratio for
prasugrel versus clopidogrel, 0.81; 95% ci 0.73–0.90; p<0.001), with a relative reduction of
19%. the study concluded that prasugrel therapy results in a significant reduction of ischemic
events, including stent thrombosis, but leads to an increased risk of major bleeding, including
fatal bleeding. the study also suggested that prasugrel may cause more significant reduction
in the risk of cv events in patients with diabetes.
 xxxd3373xxx  ( xxxd3373xxx ) is the first of a new class of antiplatelet family called cyclopentyltriazolo-pyrimidines (cptps) and is also the first oral reversible selective  xxxg1645xxx  receptor
antagonist. in the multicenter, double-blind, randomized plato trial20, 18,624 cases were
randomized to  xxxd3373xxx  and clopidogrel. results showed that in patients who have acs with
or without st-segment elevation, incidences of the primary endpoint events (cv death, mi,
or stroke) were significantly lower in the  xxxd3373xxx  group compared with the clopidogrel
group (9.8% vs 11.7%, p = 0.0001), with no significant difference in major bleeding events
between the two groups (11.6% vs 11.2%, p = 0.43).
 xxxd423xxx , an intravenous agent, could achieve the maximum antiplatelet effect in only < 5
minutes; after an interruption of 60 minutes, the platelet function can be restored. some
scholars believe that  xxxd423xxx  may be used in short term for the treatment of acs or in
emergency pci2,3. elinogrel was the first orally or intravenously used  xxxg1645xxx  receptor

antagonist, which does not require hepatic transformation to active metabolites by enzymes,
thus minimizing inter-individual reactions. it directly inhibits the  xxxg1645xxx  with a fast onset and
offset and is well tolerated with no adverse events. it is, therefore, a promising candidate for
cv protection28.
the results of this meta-analysis are in line with the other meta-analyses conducted so far.
aradi et al., conducted a systematic review in 2013 and a meta-analysis for the period of

downloaded by [university of arizona] at 00:17 29 september 2015

1975 to 2012 to assess the influence of p2y receptor inhibition of different potency on major
cv outcomes in patients with acs or in those undergoing pci. the review concluded that
the higher-potency inhibition of  xxxg1645xxx  receptor led to a decreased risk of cv death and mi,
but not stroke, compared with clopidogrel29. another meta-analysis by bellemain-appaix et
al., which compared the improvement in clinical outcomes after pci between clopidogrel and
new  xxxg1645xxx  inhibitor groups, revealed that new  xxxg1645xxx  inhibitors decreased mortality rate (or:
0.83, 95% ci 0.75–0.92, p<0.001 for the whole cohort), maces by 18% (p<0.001), and stent
thrombosis by 40% (p<0.001) after pci compared with clopidogrel. in addition, the
risk/benefit ratio particularly favored pci for patients with stemi27.
as per our current analysis, the new  xxxg1645xxx  receptor antagonist significantly decreased allcause mortality by 19% (or 0.81; 95% ci 0.73–0.90, p<0.0001), mace by 15% (or 0.85;
95% ci 0.76–0.96, p = 0.009), and mi by 13% (or 0.87; 95% ci 0.76–0.99, p = 0.03) when
compared with clopidogrel. overall, the new  xxxg1645xxx  receptor antagonists were found to cause
a significant reduction in the incidence of cv death by 18% (or 0.82; 95% ci 0.73–0.92, p
= 0.001). moreover, our analysis demonstrated a significant decrease (42%) in the incidence
of stent thrombosis with  xxxg1645xxx  receptor antagonist, indicating the superiority of the new
 xxxg1645xxx  receptor antagonist over clopidogrel in the prevention of stent thrombosis after pci. it
is noteworthy that the incidences of stroke and major bleeding events between the two groups
demonstrated no significant difference rather a trend in significance was observed. moreover,

considering individual studies and pooled analysis, no significant differences in major
bleeding events were noted except triton study wherein prasugrel demonstrated increased
risk of major bleeding. we, therefore, suggest further investigations to be carried out for
analyzing risk/benefit ratio of ischemic and bleeding events.
this meta-analysis may have some potential limitations. there might be important
confounders, which inevitably influence the final effects such as study design, length of

follow-up, inclusion and exclusion criteria, and the clinical outcomes. for instance, various
definitions of ischemic outcome measures, such as maces, might hide the possible
differences in its components, especially when one event is more common than the others.
most of the included studies had positive test results, which might lead to publication bias30.
given the concerns mentioned, the authors' conclusions should be treated with caution.
conclusion
in patients undergoing pci, new  xxxg1645xxx  receptor inhibitors reported reduced risk for major
ischemic events when compared with clopidogrel, except for the occurrence of stroke.
however, there was no significant increase in major bleeding events. further investigations
are warranted to analyze the risk/benefit ratio of ischemic and bleeding events.
