tumors are angiogenesis dependent and  xxxg2413xxx -a ( xxxg2413xxx ), a heparinbinding protein, is a key angiogenic factor. as chemotherapy and co-treatment with anticoagulant
 xxxd1997xxx  (lmwh) are common in cancer patients, we investigated whether
angiogenesis in vivo mediated by  xxxg2413xxx  is modulated by metronomic-type treatment with: (i) the
lmwh  xxxd1805xxx ; (ii) low-dosage cytostatic  xxxd2008xxx ; or (iii) a combination of these two drugs.
using the quantitative rat mesentery angiogenesis assay, in which angiogenesis was induced by
intraperitoneal injection of very low doses of vegf,  xxxd1805xxx  sodium ( xxxd1805xxx ) and  xxxd2008xxx 
( xxxd2008xxx ) were administered separately or in combination by continuous subcutaneous infusion at a constant rate for 14 consecutive days.  xxxd1805xxx  was administered at 27, 80, or
240 iu ⁄ kg ⁄ day, i.e., doses that reﬂect the clinical usage of this drug, while  xxxd2008xxx  was given at
the well-tolerated dosage of 0.4 mg ⁄ kg ⁄ day. while  xxxd1805xxx  signiﬁcantly stimulated angiogenesis in
an inversely dose-dependent manner,  xxxd2008xxx  did not signiﬁcantly aﬀect angiogenesis. however,
concurrent treatment with  xxxd1805xxx  and  xxxd2008xxx  signiﬁcantly inhibited angiogenesis. the eﬀect of
 xxxd1805xxx  is the ﬁrst demonstration of a proangiogenic eﬀect of any lmwh in vivo. the fact that
co-treatment with  xxxd1805xxx  and  xxxd2008xxx  signiﬁcantly inhibited angiogenesis suggests a complex
drug eﬀect.

tumor growth is angiogenesis dependent.
heparin-binding vascular endothelial growth
factor-a ( xxxg2413xxx ; vegf) is a key angiogenic
factor in hypoxia, wound healing, inﬂammation, and tumor development (1). vegf also
appears to be a mediator of angiogenic pathways involving other proangiogenic factors. the
most potent endogenous pro- and antireceived 18 december 2009. accepted 19 april 2010

angiogenic proteins bind heparin and are dependent upon heparan sulfate for their biologic
activities, while several enzymes and extracellular proteins bind heparin (2). systemic heparin
treatment may aﬀect these proteins and
enzymes, blood cells and other circulating cells,
as well as vascular endothelial cells (ecs).

disseminated intravascular coagulation and
thromboembolism, which requires anticoagulant therapy. in clinical trials, cancer patients
undergoing surgery or suﬀering from acute
thrombosis and receiving conventional chemotherapy in combination with s.c. administration of various low-molecular-weight heparins
(lmwhs) display signiﬁcantly improved survival times, as compared with patients who are
treated either subcutaneously with unfractionated heparin (ufh) or orally with the anticoagulant warfarin, or those who do not receive any
anticoagulant treatment (3–9). extended survival is the most rigorous clinical benchmark for
cancer drugs. the fact that lmwhs exert probably multiple anti-cancer activities that are basically unrelated to their anticoagulant activity
attracts increasing interest as the basis for
improved survival times in patients with cancer
(2–6, 10). however, deﬁnitive conclusions
regarding the true anti-neoplastic eﬀects of
lmwhs cannot be drawn from the data of clinical trials given the current methodologic limitations.
the marketed anticoagulant lmwhs represent a diverse group of depolymerized heparin
preparations, with mean molecular weight
(mw) ranging from 2 to 9 kda, although they
are usually in the approximately 6 kda range
(11).  xxxd1805xxx  has a mw of 6 kda. most
lmwhs are isolated from ufh (mw
15 kda). depending on the manufacturing
processes used, the lmwhs show structural,
biochemical, and pharmacologic diﬀerences,
and their behaviors show dependencies on dosage and route of administration (12, 13). regulatory agencies, such as the european medicines
agency and the u.s. food and drug administration, consider the lmwhs to be distinct
pharmacologic agents and recommend that they
should not be regarded as being interchangeable
(14, 15). however, the pharmacologic diﬀerences between these agents do not produce clinically important diﬀerences in the outcomes of
anti-coagulation therapy in patients with venous
thromboembolism (14).
metronomic chemotherapy, which is characterized by continuous or frequent treatment
with cytotoxic agents at low and well-tolerated
dosages, has for many drugs been shown in preclinical studies to exert potent anti-angiogenic
eﬀects and improved anti-tumor eﬀects without
950

important toxic side eﬀects, as compared with
conventional chemotherapy given at high doses
at intervals of typically 2–4 weeks (16, 17).
somewhat similar beneﬁcial results are reported
concerning metronomic chemotherapy in
patients with common types of cancer (18–21).
continuous infusion, as used in the present
study, can be viewed as an extended form of
metronomic treatment (22). the primary target
of metronomic chemotherapy is the angiogenically activated, proliferating normal ec in the
tumor vasculature. the activated ec is genomically stable, and therefore, is endowed with a
considerably lower risk of mutation and subsequent development of drug resistance than genomically unstable neoplastic cells. in addition
to exerting a direct anti-proliferative eﬀect on
angiogenically activated ecs, some chemotherapeutics induce the expression of the potent
endogenous anti-angiogenic factor thrombospondin in ecs cells in vitro (23) and tumors
in vivo (24).
the aim of the present study was to elucidate
whether metronomic-like treatment, i.e., continuous s.c. infusion, with the  xxxd1805xxx  alone; the
chemotherapeutic agent  xxxd2008xxx  alone at a
low, virtually non-toxic dose; or these two drugs
in combination modulates vegf-mediated
angiogenesis in vivo.

materials and methods
animals
adult male sprague–dawley rats (b & k universal,
sollentuna, sweden) were acclimatized to a standardized environment for at least 7 days, fed ad libitum
and randomly allocated to weight-matched groups
with two animals housed per cage (25). at the start of
the experiments, when the animals were 6–7 weeks
old, the mean body weights in diﬀerent experiments
ranged from 218 to 223 g. body weight was monitored daily. the controls increased in weight by
approximately 55 g per week. given the prompt physiologic growth, drug-related weight-gain retardation
is a sensitive surrogate evaluation of toxicity, which
also includes systemic well-being, anorexia and failure
to thrive. gauging body weight gain during chemotherapy is important, as low toxicity, which allows
long-term continuous or frequent treatment, is inherent to metronomic scheduling. moreover, toxic eﬀects
diminish analysis sensitivity. the local animal ethics
committee approved this study. the ethical

angiogenesis induction and a note on the mesentery
assay
rat rvegf164 (564-rv ⁄ cf; r&d systems europe,
ltd., oxon, uk), which is the predominant  xxxg2413xxx 
isoform in rats, was diluted to 96 pmol ⁄ ml in endotoxin-free saline used for infusion into patients, frozen and thawed, and a volume of 5 ml was injected
i.p. into the rats (27). this treatment, given twice daily
for 4.5 days, i.e., from monday morning (day 0) to
friday morning (day 4), induces a vigorous angiogenic response in the mesenteric test tissues, peaking
around day 21 (27). the vegf does not aﬀect body
weight gain. it was within this time frame of microvessel network proliferation that the s.c. treatments
with  xxxd1805xxx  and  xxxd2008xxx  were given.
similar to most normal adult tissues, the test tissue
used, i.e., the membranous, small-gut mesentery in
rats is natively vascularized (albeit sparsely) and lacks
signiﬁcant physiologic angiogenesis due to equilibrium between pro- and anti-angiogenic inﬂuences (28,
29). the test tissue is untouched mechanically until
the experiment is concluded. the inﬂammatory stimulus of the test tissue is minimal, if any, ensuring a
high level of sensitivity, because inﬂammation induces
angiogenesis (28). this model compares well with
other in vivo angiogenesis models, as discussed elsewhere, and allows true quantiﬁcation of unbiased
variables (28, 29). importantly, the rat mesenteric
assay replicates the clinical situation, as the test drugs
are administered systemically and the responses
observed reﬂect the net eﬀect of all the metabolic,
cellular, and molecular alterations induced by the
treatment.

been anesthetized with inhaled isoﬂurane (forene,

made for pump implantation, was immediately
sutured post-implantation. as only minute volumes
were infused at a low rate, it is highly improbable
that ph in the mesentery microvessels was aﬀected to
any measurable degree by the diﬀerence in vehicle ph
for  xxxd1805xxx  and  xxxd2008xxx . as the animals substantially gained weight physiologically during the
experimental period (table 1), the actual dose per kg
body weight was somewhat above the average dosage
at the beginning of the infusion period and somewhat
below the average dosage at the end of the infusion
period.

 xxxd2008xxx  monotherapy – in an initial dose-ﬁnding
experiment,  xxxd2008xxx , which is of the anthracycline
class of intercalating topoisomerase-targeting agents
(30), was infused at doses of 1.5, 3.0, and
6.0 mg ⁄ kg ⁄ week. the drug was diluted in 0.9% (w ⁄ v)
nacl (ph 4.5), used for infusion into patients. vehicle controls were infused in a similar fashion. the
intention was to ﬁnd a well-tolerated dose that would
only marginally diminish the weight gain, as compared with the rapidly growing vehicle controls
(table 1). in the subsequent angiogenesis experiments,  xxxd2008xxx  at 3.0 mg ⁄ kg ⁄ week was used. it has
been claimed that the dosage per body surface area
(mg ⁄ m2) may be useful in comparing drug toxicities

between species (i.e., between laboratory animals and
humans). for a rat that weighs 250 g, the dosage in
mg ⁄ kg multiplied by 7 yields the approximate dosage
in mg ⁄ m2. thus, the dose used in the angiogenesis
experiment corresponds to 21 mg ⁄ m2 per week in a
human.

proximal to the ileocecal valve, were examined microscopically after being spread intact on objective slides
and stained immunohistochemically (27). normally,
this tissue is only 5- to 10-lm thick in its avascular
parts, making the whole microvessel network virtually two-dimensional, which is the basis for the
unique ability to quantify microvessel variables in the
intact tissue. the surrounding fatty tissue distinctly
delineated each window. the entire vasculature of
each of the four mesenteric windows per animal was
visualized using a primary monoclonal antibody
against rat endothelium, mrc ox-43 (31), which
labels the vascular endothelium in all tissues of the
rat, except that of the brain capillaries. this procedure allows the straightforward identiﬁcation of even
the smallest microvessels.
for the analysis of unbiased microvessel variables,
microscopic morphometry and computerized image
analysis were employed in a blinded fashion. objective variables are a prerequisite for strict dose–
response analysis. first, the total area of each
mesenteric window was measured. the following
variables were then measured in each window (27):
the percentage vascularized area (va), which is
a measurement of the spatial extension of the network; and microvascular length (mvl), which is a
composite measurement of microvessel density. the
total microvascular length (tmvl) was calculated
as tmvl = va multiplied by the mean mvl ⁄
treatment group.
statistical analysis
the non-parametric mann–whitney u-test for unpaired (two-tailed) observations was used. a mean of
four windows per animal was used as independent
data for each variable in the mesenteric window. the
criterion for statistical signiﬁcance was p £ 0.05.

results
eﬀect on physiologic body weight gain of  xxxd1805xxx 
and  xxxd2008xxx  treatment

continuous infusion of  xxxd1805xxx  at 27, 80, and
240 iu ⁄ kg ⁄ day for 14 days did not aﬀect body
weight gain compared with vehicle controls
(data not shown). the eﬀects of the continuous
infusion of  xxxd2008xxx  at 1.5, 3.0, and
6.0 mg ⁄ kg ⁄ week are shown in table 1. based
on previous experience (27, 28), we concluded
that  xxxd2008xxx  at 3.0 mg ⁄ kg ⁄ week, which
reduced body weight by only 6% at sacriﬁce
compared with the rapidly growing vehicle-treated controls, was the appropriate dosage.

this diﬀerence was statistically non-signiﬁcant.

with the vehicle + vehicle control (group c i),
although this diﬀerence was also non-signiﬁcant. co-treatment with  xxxd1805xxx  +  xxxd2008xxx  (group t ii) reduced the mvl by 24%

as the infusion of  xxxd1805xxx  (80 iu ⁄ kg ⁄ day)
+ vehicle for 14 days increased the tmvl by
31%, compared with the vehicle + vehicle controls (table 2), we performed a dose–eﬀect
study, in which we infused  xxxd1805xxx  continuously for 14 days at 27, 80, and 240 iu ⁄ kg ⁄ day
(table 3). the lowest dose, 27 iu ⁄ kg ⁄ day,
increased the va by 37%, mvl by 25%, and
tmvl by 71% (p £ 0.05), compared with the
corresponding values for the vehicle control.
the highest dosage, 240 iu ⁄ kg ⁄ day, had only
a marginal eﬀect on angiogenesis, while
80 iu ⁄ kg ⁄ day exerted intermediate eﬀects on
the va (+44%), mvl (+18%), and tmvl
(+63%). it is noteworthy that the eﬀect of  xxxd1805xxx  on mvl was signiﬁcantly dose dependent (table 3).

discussion
the present study demonstrating that  xxxd1805xxx  (mw, 6 kda) stimulates vegf-mediated
angiogenesis is to the best of our knowledge the
ﬁrst report of a proangiogenic eﬀect of any
lmwh in vivo (2). by contrast, a 5-kda
953

norrby & nordenhem

fraction of the lmwh  xxxd3379xxx  ( xxxd3379xxx ,
leo pharma, copenhagen, denmark) has been
shown to inhibit vegf-induced angiogenesis
in vivo using the same experimental system (2,
25). as  xxxd1805xxx  and  xxxd3379xxx  display similar
degrees of sulfation and the diﬀerence in mw
(6 kda vs 5 kda) is small, it appears that the
particular type of lmwh rather than the mean
molecular weight is decisive for the outcome in
the angiogenesis model used. this is important
because the anti-angiogenic eﬀect of  xxxd3379xxx 
is dependent on molecular size (25). while  xxxd1805xxx  is produced by nitrous acid depolymerization of porcine gut mucosal ufh, which
results in the formation of anhydromannose (a
ﬁve-member ring) in the molecule,  xxxd3379xxx  is
produced by controlled enzymatic depolymerization by heparinase digestion of porcine gut
mucosal ufh, which adds a double bond to the
end group of the molecule (12, 15, 32). interestingly, heparin fragments in the 4.8–5.4 kda
range, produced from porcine gut mucosa ufh
after being dissolved in buﬀer and exposed to
chromatography on a sephadex column, inhibit
the binding of 125i-vegf to the vegf receptors on cultured ecs (33).
as tumor growth is angiogenesis dependent, it
is of interest to assess the anti-angiogenic eﬀects
of candidate anti-tumor drugs. however, there
are no ways to accurately assess the anti-angiogenic eﬀect per se of drugs on tumors because
inhibition of angiogenesis limits tumor growth
and vice versa (28, 34, 35). the true anti-angiogenic eﬀect of any treatment must therefore be
assessed in a surrogate non-tumor tissue. as
vegf is a key proangiogenic factor in most
human and experimental tumors (1), vegfmediated angiogenesis would be an appropriate
surrogate model for tumor angiogenesis, especially because the ecs in tumor angiogenesis
use the same signaling pathways as the ecs
involved in non-tumor angiogenesis (36).
however, the present assay does not take into
account all the aspects of tumor-induced angiogenesis, such as the presence of multiple proangiogenic factors that usually operate in advanced
cancers (37) or the chaotic microvessel patterns
and perfusion of tumor vasculature observed
predominantly in the central parts of tumors.
nevertheless, the present assay for vegf-mediated angiogenesis has demonstrated a close correlation between the anti-angiogenic eﬀects in
954

the tumor-free mesentery on one hand and the
anti-tumor and indirectly assessed anti-angiogenic eﬀects in the tumors on the other hand
after continuous paclitaxel infusion in a rat
model of syngeneic prostate cancer (38). additional corroboration that inhibition of vegfinduced angiogenesis in the tumor-free mesentery may reﬂect signiﬁcant events leading to inhibition of tumor growth comes from the fact that
systemic treatment with bovine iron-unsaturated
lactoferrin suppresses vegf-induced angiogenesis in the rat mesentery model (39), as well as
cancer cell-induced angiogenesis in a mouse dorsal air sac assay (40). compared with other nontumor angiogenesis assays, the present assay
stands out as apparently superior in terms of biologic relevance and ability to objectively quantify pertinent angiogenesis variables (28, 29).
the fact that the continuous treatment
with ( xxxd1805xxx  +  xxxd2008xxx ) inhibited angiogenesis signiﬁcantly as compared with ( xxxd1805xxx  + vehicle) or ( xxxd2008xxx  + vehicle)
treatment is indeed interesting in view of the
improved survival time of cancer patients who
receive co-treatment of  xxxd1805xxx  and other
lmwhs with conventional chemotherapy (3–8,
10). as is true for heparins in general,  xxxd1805xxx 
is able to bind, release, and inﬂuence the actions
of heparin-binding proteins, such as proangiogenic growth factors (e.g., vegf and basic
ﬁbroblast growth factor), anti-angiogenic
factors (e.g., thrombospondin), enzymes (e.g.,
 xxxg1076xxx ), and extracellular matrix proteins
that may signiﬁcantly inﬂuence angiogenesis (2,
12, 41, 42). moreover, heparins inﬂuence a
number of additional angiogenesis-modulating
factors, such as p- and l-selectins, integrins,
platelets and all other circulating cells, circulating microparticles (derived from ecs and leukocytes), antioxidant function, and release tissue
factor pathway inhibitor ( xxxg2266xxx -1).  xxxg2266xxx -1,
which is mainly synthesized in and localized to
ecs, is the natural inhibitor of  xxxg748xxx ,
which is a critical promoter of angiogenesis. it
is noteworthy that diﬀerent lmwhs exhibit
major diﬀerences in their abilities to release
 xxxg2266xxx  from the vascular lining (43), the highest
release occurring following treatment with
 xxxd3379xxx  (10, 43). not surprisingly,  xxxg2266xxx -1
released by 6–8 kda  xxxd3379xxx  fractions suppresses angiogenesis in the embryonic chick
chorioallantoic membrane assay (44).

 xxxd1805xxx  stimulates angiogenesis

as recently demonstrated using the present
experimental system, low concentrations of
exogenous antioxidants play a decisive role in
the angiogenesis-modulating eﬀects of certain
cytotoxic agents that are infused continuously at low doses (31, 45). thus, ﬂuorouracil,
cisplatin, and paclitaxel signiﬁcantly inhibit
vegf-mediated angiogenesis when the vehicle
displays antioxidant activity or in the case
of co-treatment with a potent antioxidant,
whereas these cytotoxics show no anti-angiogenic eﬀects when the vehicle lacks an antioxidant. by contrast, continuous low-dosage
infusion of doxorubicin, which is an epimer
(one of two molecules that diﬀer only in the
spatial arrangement around a single carbon
atom) of  xxxd2008xxx , does not aﬀect vegfmediated angiogenesis even when combined
with an antioxidant (31). therefore, the antiangiogenic eﬀects by the concurrent treatment
with  xxxd1805xxx  and  xxxd2008xxx  (table 2) are
probably not dependent on antioxidant activity
of  xxxd1805xxx . some additional, as yet
unknown, feature of  xxxd1805xxx  appears to play
an important role in the anti-angiogenic action.
the fact that ( xxxd1805xxx  +  xxxd2008xxx ) signiﬁcantly inhibited angiogenesis, while the individual drugs at the doses given did not inﬂuence
angiogenesis, is in line with results obtained for
mice bearing the human u87 glioblastoma
xenograft: in these mice, tumor growth was
unaﬀected by daily s.c. injections of  xxxd1805xxx 
alone or only moderately aﬀected by  xxxd3191xxx 
alone, whereas the co-treatment of  xxxd1805xxx 
and  xxxd3191xxx  signiﬁcantly decreased the level of
vegf in the tumors and strongly inhibited
tumor growth (46).  xxxd3191xxx  is a small molecule
inhibitor of  xxxg2198xxx  receptors, including
the vegf receptors.
as it is not known which of the marketed
lmwhs exerts the most potent anti-neoplastic
eﬀect in cancer patients receiving chemotherapy,
be it conventional or metronomic, bona ﬁde
prospective clinical trials comparing directly the
eﬀects of two or more lmwhs on survival time
and disease progression are warranted.
the proangiogenic eﬀect of  xxxd1805xxx  in the
present report should be beneﬁcial for the treatment of non-cancer patients with poor peripheral circulation or thromboembolism causing
tissue hypoxia, which induces compensatory
vegf-mediated angiogenesis. the present
 2010 the authors journal compilation  2010 apmis

ﬁndings actually appear to ﬁt the available clinical data in this respect. it is of note that daily
s.c. injections of  xxxd1805xxx  for up to 6 months
(5,000 iu, corresponding to 60–70 iu ⁄ kg ⁄
day) signiﬁcantly improve the outcomes for
chronic foot ulcers in diabetic patients with
peripheral arterial occlusive disease (47). furthermore, it has been hypothesized that  xxxd1805xxx , which appears to improve the capillary
circulation in the foot ulcer margin, could have
a proangiogenic eﬀect in these patients (48).
moreover, in patients with stable coronary artery
disease, exercise in combination with  xxxd1805xxx 
reduces myocardial ischemia, possibly as a
result of enhanced collateral function (49).
the swedish medical research council (5249) and
pﬁzer sweden ab provided ﬁnancial support for this
study. during this study, dr. nordenhem was
employed by pﬁzer sweden ab.
