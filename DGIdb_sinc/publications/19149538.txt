abstract:  xxxg651xxx  ( xxxg651xxx ) is a key regulator of insulin-stimulating hormones, glucagon-like peptide
(glp-1) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (gip), thus it is a promising target for the treatment of type 2
diabetes mellitus (t2dm). inhibition of plasma  xxxg651xxx  enzyme leads to enhanced endogenous glp-1 and gip activity,
which ultimately results in the potentiation of insulin secretion by pancreatic -cells and subsequent lowering of blood
glucose levels, hba[1c], glucagon secretion and liver glucose production. various classes of structurally different  xxxg651xxx 
inhibitors are currently being explored and few of them such as sitagliptin and  xxxd3510xxx  were successfully launched.
these drugs have been approved as a once-daily oral monotherapy or as a combination therapy with current anti-diabetic
agents like pioglitazone,  xxxd2215xxx , metformin etc. for the treatment of t2dm. several other novel  xxxg651xxx  inhibitors
are in pipeline. the present review summarizes the latest preclinical and clinical trial data of different  xxxg651xxx  inhibitors
with a special emphasis on their dpp8/9 fold selectivity and therapeutic advantages over glp-1 based approach.

key words:  xxxg651xxx , glp-1, t2dm, developmental progress, sitagliptin,  xxxd3510xxx , alogliptin, selectivity.
1. introduction
t2dm is a metabolic disorder characterized by impaired
control of blood glucose level. t2dm is prevalent worldwide affecting almost 6% of the population. it is predicted
that 366 million people will be affected by t2dm in the next
30 years if preventive measures are not taken [1]. med ad
news projects that an aging and increasingly obese population will spur the market for t2dm drugs to $20.5 billion by
2012. the current oral pharmacological treatments against
t2dm include metformin, sulfonylurea (su), thiazolidinedione (tzd) and glycosidase inhibitors. these anti-diabetic
agents are associated with adverse events like gastrointestinal toxicities, weight gain, edema, hypoglycemia etc and
thus, there is a need to develop novel therapeutic agents.
over recent years, therapies that increase the circulating insulin levels proved to be beneficial for the treatment of
t2dm. low molecular weight reversible inhibitors of dpp
iv were studied for several years [2] and were found to
lower glucose level, increase glucose tolerance and improve
insulin response to oral glucose challenge in patients with
t2dm [3].
 xxxg651xxx  is a serine aminopeptidase that inactivates incretins, especially glp-1 and gip, which are gut hormones
released in response to food intake. glp-1 has several glucoregulatory activities as outlined in fig. (1). this spectrum
of glucoregulatory actions of glp-1 underscores its importance in t2dm therapy. as soon as released from the gut
during meals, the incretin hormones (glp-1 and gip) serve

as enhancers of glucose-dependent insulin release from pancreatic -cells [3]. as glp-1 is rapidly eliminated (within 1
min) because of its cleavage by  xxxg651xxx  into an inactive metabolite, several strategies were explored including the use of
exogenous glp-1, glp-1 fusion proteins and  xxxg651xxx  resistant glp-1 analogs for the treatment of t2dm. chronic infusion of glp-1 to t2dm patients resulted in a significant
decrease in both blood glucose and plasma hba[1c] levels
[4-5]. however, the requirement of parenteral route of administration and potential for development of autoantibodies are the major drawbacks associated with this
therapeutic approach. in addition, sustained glp-1 infusion
induced nausea and vomiting in clinical studies [6]. thus,
 xxxg651xxx  has emerged as a potential therapeutic target for the
treatment of t2dm. the proof of concept for the efficacy of
 xxxg651xxx  inhibitors was provided by  xxxg651xxx  deficient mice
that were healthy, fertile and displayed improved glucose
homeostasis [7-8]. further evidence for efficacy in humans
was provided by clinical studies carried out with sitagliptin
and  xxxd3510xxx  as monotherapy or in combination with
other existing anti-diabetic agents. the mechanism of action
by which  xxxg651xxx  inhibitors lower blood glucose is distinct
from existing class of oral glucose-lowering agents. they
control elevated blood glucose by potentiating pancreatic
insulin secretion, increasing circulating glp-1, reducing
glucagon secretion, and signaling the liver to reduce glucose
production [9]. this review summarizes the developmental
status of different  xxxg651xxx  inhibitors with an emphasis on
their preclinical and clinical findings. it covers the potential
advantages of current  xxxg651xxx  inhibitors over glp-1 mimetic based therapy. finally, as two clinical candidates of
this category have been successfully launched, the review
also provides an overview of preclinical and clinical efficacy
data of selected  xxxg651xxx  inhibitors.

oral  xxxg651xxx  inhibitors on glp-1 and gip is shown. half life of glp-1 and gip is increased upon inhibition of plasma  xxxg651xxx  by oral dpp
iv inhibitors.

2.  xxxg651xxx  enzyme ( xxxg651xxx ): structure, catalysis requirements and substrate
specificity
 xxxg651xxx  is a 766 amino acid long aminopeptidase. the
crystal structure of  xxxg651xxx  revealed that it is a tetramer with
each sub-unit comprising of two structural domains, nterminal  propeller domain and c-terminal catalytic domain
[10]. the -propeller domain consists of eight blades with 4
anti-parallel strands and harbors an ellipsoidal and continuously open tunnel. the catalytic domain adopts a typical /
hydrolase fold with a central eight-stranded  sheet sandwiched by several  helices. the active site of the enzyme is
covered by the -propeller domain thus restricting access to
the substrate. therefore, there are two possible routes for
substrate access: tunnel through the  propeller domain [10]
or a side opening formed at the interface of -propeller domain and catalytic domain [11].
 xxxg651xxx  is a glycosylated protease belonging to the subset
of proteins that are capable of cleaving post-proline bond
two amino acids downstream of the n-terminal of protein. it
has preference for x-pro over x-ala, where x is any amino
acid other than proline [12]. it is generally believed that glycosylation of an integral protein is required for its enzymatic
activity. however, in the case of  xxxg651xxx  it appe-ars to be
controversial [11, 13].
based on in vitro studies, a wide range of potential substrates including  xxxg891xxx , bradykinin, certain chemokines,  xxxg1590xxx ,  xxxg354xxx , etc (table 1) have been identified but only few of them such as
glp-1 and gip are reported to be the endogenous substrates
[14-15]. although  xxxg651xxx  has a preference for proline in the
second position but glp-1, the endogenous substrate of dpp
iv, has alanine in this position. a high expression of this

enzyme is observed in kidneys, where it is localized in the
glomerular basement membrane and proximal convoluted
tubules. however, there are reports demonstrating that dpp
iv is expressed in other tissues as well and widely distributed in the body [16].
3. physiological actions of incretin
hormones, their use and limitations
in the recent years, approaches targeting elevation of
glp-1 have emerged as a promising area for t2dm therapy.
physiological actions of glp-1 and gip are described in fig.
(1). briefly, they stimulate glucose dependent insulin secretion, inhibit glucagon secretion, delay gastric emptying, suppress appetite, stimulate differentiation and proliferation and
inhibit apoptosis of -cells thus they increase the -cell mass
and improve peripheral glucose uptake and disposal. extrapancreatic actions include the reduction of hepatic insulin
clearance [17] and an apparent “insulin mimetic” effect on
skeletal muscle [18], liver and adipose tissues. but the half
life of these hormones is very short (t1/2= ~1 min) as they are
rapidly cleaved by circulating  xxxg651xxx  enzyme to produce an
inactive product, glp-1 (9-36 aa) amide [19]. inhibition of
circulating  xxxg651xxx  enzyme by  xxxg651xxx  inhibitors prolongs
the half life of glp-1 leading to increased levels of active
endogenous glp-1 and gip. the two forms of glp-1 secreted after the meal ingestion, glp-1 (7-37) and glp-1 (736) amide, differ from each other by single amino acid. both
peptide forms are equipotent and exhibit identical plasma
activities [18, 20-21]. glp-1 contributes more towards
maintenance of glucose homeostasis than gip [21]. another
approach to increase the circulating levels of active glp-1 is
the use of glp-1 analogs which are resistant to cleavage by
 xxxg651xxx . glp-1 mimetics such as  xxxd2495xxx ,  xxxd2495xxx , exenatide (byettatm), ac2993lar ( xxxd2076xxx  long acting)

and ave-10 had showed substantial increase in insulin secretion in preclinical animal models. exenatide is the first
incretin mimetic drug approved for clinical use by the us
food and drug administration (fda). in phase 3 clinical
trials, exenatide reduced hba[1c] by ~1% and body weight
by ~2 kg in t2dm patients who were unable to achieve glycemic control with metformin and/or a sulfonylurea. exenatide is a 39 amino-acid peptide that exhibits gluco-regulatory
activities similar to glp-1 [22-23]. unlike su and meglitinides, exenatide increases insulin synthesis and secretion in
the presence of glucose only. since the actions of exenatide
on insulin secretion and glucagon suppression are glucose
dependent, the risk of hypoglycemia can be minimized to
some extent except when used in combination therapy with
agents that induce hypoglycemia, such as su. the major
drawback with glp-1 peptide analogs is the lack of orally
bio-available dosage forms. it was observed in clinical trials

that administration of glp-1 analogs caused nausea and
vomiting. in rodents, it was reported that glp-1 led to adverse effects such as increased heart rate and blood pressure;
however the same were not observed in humans [24]. in addition, it was recently observed during post marketing surveillance that two out of six patients receiving byettatm succumbed to death because of hemorrhagic pancreatitis [25].

co./ xxxd1881xxx ) were discontinued in phase 3 trials in 2003 because of the occurrence of malignant tumors in long-term
mice studies. muraglitazar (bristol-myers squibb) exhibited
major adverse cardiovascular events and increased incidence
of death in phase 3 trials compared with placebo or pioglitazone (takeda).  xxxd2495xxx , a  xxxg651xxx  resistant glp-1 analog, reduced fasting and postprandial glucose, was weight
neutral but caused nausea and diarrhea upon administration.
5.  xxxg651xxx  inhibitors: proof of concept
studies
extensive evidence suggests that therapeutic benefits in
treatment of t2dm can be realized by selective  xxxg651xxx  inhibition.  xxxg651xxx  null mice which are healthy and viable
showed no significant n-terminal degradation of glp-1.
consistent with this, these mice displayed increased levels of
insulin and improved glucose tolerance even on a high fat
diet, which could be due to the persistent activity of the insulin-stimulating hormone glp-1 and perhaps due to active
gip as well [7-8]. in agreement with the  xxxg651xxx -deficient
mice data, a strain of rat with a natural point mutation in
 xxxg651xxx  displayed similar glucose lowering effects [9].
increasing number of studies involving different animal
models such as zucker fatty rats, db/db mice and  xxxd3249xxx  induced diabetic rats, revealed that administration of
small molecule inhibitors of  xxxg651xxx  led to decreased plasma
 xxxg651xxx  activity, enhanced insulin levels and reduced glucose levels along with the restoration of -cell function and
islet neogenesis [26-28].
available data indicate that the oral administration of
 xxxg651xxx  inhibitors led to a sustained reduction in hba[1c] to
a clinically meaningful level with weight neutrality and
minimal hypoglycemic events [15,29]. these agents can
compete with the existing oral anti-diabetic agents like pioglitazone, su etc, particularly because of their weight neutrality and lower hypoglycemic risk. however due to higher
cost of medicine and lack of familiarity, it is likely that they
may be used mainly as a combination therapy with other
agents for a few years. thus,  xxxg651xxx  inhibition is a therapeutically proven and effective strategy to treat a multifactorial and complex disease like t2dm.

6. structure of  xxxg651xxx  inhibitors in clinical trial and discovery phases
while development of inhibitors possessing selectivity
towards  xxxg651xxx  over dpp-8 and dpp-9 is a major challenge, extensive structure activity relationship (sar) work
however, has indicated that desired selectivity for  xxxg651xxx 
inhibition can be achieved via introducing appropriate substituent or group. moreover, in addition to focusing on potency and selectivity, development of long acting inhibitors
is also desirable because they could potentially provide
maximal efficacy, particularly in severe diabetic patients
(e.g., hba[1c] > 9%). until recently, a diverse class of dpp
iv inhibitors has been reported in the literature and the lead
molecules in various stages of clinical development are listed
in tables 3 and 4. based on their structural features these
inhibitors can be divided into two classes e.g. peptidomimetic and non-peptidomimetic series. the peptidomimetic series can be subdivided into (a) glycine-based inhibitors or series and (b) -alanine-based inhibitors or -series.
in the case of -series, the pyrrolidine derivatives have
been widely explored as  xxxg651xxx  inhibitors due to  xxxg651xxx ’s
specificity for substrate having an amino-terminal proline at
c-2. depending on the presence of a substituent (z) at the c2 of the pyrrolidine ring, the -series can be further divided
into two classes e.g. (a) irreversible {when z = diphenylphosphonate ester [-p(o)(oph)2] or o-acylhydroxamic acid
(conhocor’)} and (b) reversible {when z = boronic acid
[b(oh)2], nitrile (cn) or hydrogen} inhibitors. 2-cyano
pyrrolidine based inhibitors that belong to the reversible
class of -series have been studied most extensively because
apart from behaving as a proline mimic, the presence of nitrile on the five-membered ring provided (i) nanomolar inhibition of  xxxg651xxx  and (ii) chemical stability adequate for oral
administration.  xxxd3510xxx  (table 4), a potent, selective,
and orally active inhibitor of  xxxg651xxx , is the most advanced
compound in this series [30]. despite the advancement of
 xxxd3510xxx  in clinical trials, one of the key issues encountered with the use of 2-cyano pyrrolidine derivatives was its
stability in solution due to the participation of cyano group in
an intramolecular cyclization process thereby generating inactive products. this problem was addressed by introducing
a cyclopropyl ring fused on the pyrrolidine moiety leading to

the identification of cis-4,5-methanoprolinenitrile-containing
inhibitors.  xxxd3176xxx  [31] (table 4), a highly efficacious,
stable, and long-acting  xxxg651xxx  inhibitor showed robust glucose-lowering effects in a dose-dependent manner in the
zuckerfa/fa rat ogtt model and efficacy in reducing postprandial glucose auc in ob/ob mice. this compound was
effective in elevating insulin levels after an ogtt in ob/ob
mice and is currently undergoing phase 3 clinical trials. incorporation of a fluoro substituent at c-4 position of the 2cyanopyrrolidine ring in a cis-fashion provided a new and
stable series of inhibitors. this is exemplified by the identification of denagliptin [32] (table 4), though the phase 3
clinical study on this molecule has been suspended.

in contrast to the -series that was mainly developed by
using information and data available in the literature, the series was generally developed from a lead obtained via
high-throughput screening (hts). a number of inhibitors
based on -amino amide backbone have been reported. a
triazolopiperazine-based inhibitor sitagliptin [33] (table 4)
that belongs to this -aminoamide series was found to be
highly selective inhibitor of  xxxg651xxx  and was launched in
2007.

from the traditional - or -series in terms of their structures
and an impressive number of compounds that belong to this

class have been reported. in most of the cases x-ray crystallography studies showed that in spite of their distinct structural features these inhibitors interacted well with the dpp
iv active site. the most advanced compound in this series is
alogliptin [34] (table 4) that is presently undergoing phase
3 clinical trial.
it is important to mention here that depending on their nature
of interactions with  xxxg651xxx  active site all the inhibitors can
be classified as covalent and non-covalent inhibitors. for
example, as indicated by the x-ray studies on  xxxg651xxx  bound
inhibitors,  xxxd3510xxx  and  xxxd3176xxx  belong to the class of
covalent inhibitors whereas sitagliptin and ly 2463665 [35]
belong to the non-covalent class.

7. developmental progress of  xxxg651xxx  inhibitors
the launch of sitagliptin and  xxxd3510xxx  for the treatment of t2dm validated the therapeutic potential of this
category of anti-diabetic agents. in this section, we present
the developmental status, preclinical and clinical findings of
different  xxxg651xxx  inhibitors that are listed in table 3. pk data
of selected  xxxg651xxx  inhibitors are described in table 5.

rats after acute and subchronic treatment. in an ogtt study
in vdf rats, p32/98 improved glucose and insulin kinetics
after 12 weeks of administration [43]. studies in wistar rats
with p32/98 showed a dramatic increase of active glp-1
(13.4%-90%). further studies in lean and obese zucker rats
demonstrated inhibition of  xxxg651xxx  activity (65%) and a
150% increase in insulin levels compared to controls. longterm treatment with this compound improved the glucose
tolerance, insulinemia, peripheral insulin sensitivity and cell glucose responsiveness. in clinical studies, p32/98
showed a significant postprandial improvement in glucose
tolerance in diabetic patients [60]. although p32/98 was the
first molecule that showed efficacy in animal studies, but it
was not considered for further development due to the observed toxicities. another compound p93/01 demonstrated a
dose-dependent reduction of prandial glucose in patients
with t2dm and was evaluated further in phase 2 trials. no
further development has been reported so far.
nvp dpp728
nvp dpp728 is an orally active selective and extensively studied  xxxg651xxx  inhibitor discovered by novartis ag.
this compound reduced  xxxg651xxx  activity in plasma and improved glucose tolerance in diabetic zucker rats [27]. in a
randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, multicentre
4 week study, nvp dpp728 (100 mg t.i.d or 150 mg b.i.d)
showed a marked improvement in glycemic control (0.6%
reduction in hba[1c]) to a similar extent in both the dosing

regimens. this compound was safe, tolerable and weight
neutral with low incidence of hypoglycemia (4 treatment vs
1 placebo) [42]. however, it did not enhance insulin levels.
in fact mean 24 h insulin levels were decreased in both the
treatment groups.
 xxxd3510xxx  (galvus)
 xxxd3510xxx  is a potent, selective, reversible and orally
bioavailable  xxxg651xxx  inhibitor with better anti-hyperglycemic
properties, being developed by novartis ag for the treatment of t2dm [30]. in healthy human volunteers,  xxxd3510xxx  was rapidly absorbed with 85% bioavailability [61]
and a half-life of about 90 minutes. however, sustained dpp
iv inhibition was observed for more than 10 h [62-66]. in a
preclinical study it was observed that this agent expands cell mass [20-21]. pk data in cyanomolgous monkey is provided in table 5.
in different clinical trials  xxxd3510xxx  was tested both as
monotherapy and in combination with other anti-diabetic
agents like metformin, tzd, su or insulin, and was found to
improve glycemic control (0.7% reduction in hba [1c]) [29].
it improved glp-1 and gip levels, reduced plasma glucose
and glucagon concentration without the risk of adverse effects that are commonly associated with pioglitazone or metformin therapy [67]. in meal tolerance tests, single dose of
 xxxd3510xxx  augmented insulin secretion in t2dm patients
and inhibited hepatic glucose release, leading to increased
suppression of endogenous glucose production [21, 67]. vil-

emerging drug candidates of  xxxg651xxx  inhibitor class

dagliptin may be used as a prophylactic therapy in subjects
that are prone to t2dm as it was found to improve postprandial glycemia through increased insulin sensitivity and
-cell function in subjects with impaired fasting glucose [68].
 xxxd3510xxx , at 50 and 100 mg, is safe and tolerable with
incidence of adverse events similar to placebo group [29].
the most common adverse events associated with  xxxd3510xxx  are headache, nasopharyngitis, cough, constipation,
dizziness, and increased sweating [62]. hyperinsulinemic
hypoglycemia and nesidioblastosis due to increased circulating concentrations of glp-1 observed after gastric bypass
surgery are other possible adverse effects that were reported
[21, 69].
 xxxd3510xxx  did not show any significant effect on the
pharmacokinetic profile of commonly used anti-hypertensive
drugs [70-73]. even a high fat meal did not interfere with
 xxxd3510xxx  pharmacokinetics and thus, it could be recommended for taking along with meals [74-75].  xxxd3510xxx 
bioavailability in patients with mild, moderate or severe hepatic impairment was unaltered as compared to healthy subjects [76].
 xxxd3510xxx , a once-daily oral treatment for patients with
t2dm, was approved by european union in sep’ 2007 [77].
further studies are being carried out on  xxxd3510xxx  to
evaluate its long term efficacy, safety and tolerability in
comparison with other anti-diabetic agents and results are
awaited [39, 21, 78]. extensive studies are required to assess
advantages of this agent over current anti-diabetic therapies
in t2dm patients, particularly in terms of effects on pancreatic -cell restoration and potential weight loss [21, 79].
sitagliptin (januvia

tm

)

sitagliptin, an oral once daily and highly selective dpp
iv inhibitor, was evaluated in clinical trials as a monotherapy, or as an add-on therapy with existing anti-diabetic
agents like metformin [80]. sitagliptin provided effective
fasting and postprandial glycemic control in a wide range of
patients with t2dm. markers of -cell function also improved with sitagliptin treatment [81]. sitagliptin may also
have several advantages over currently available insulin secretagogues such as su agents. it was generally well tolerated with an overall incidence of adverse experiences comparable to placebo, a low risk of hypoglycemia or gi disturbances, and a neutral effect on body weight [80, 82, 83].
good bioavailability following the oral administration of
sitagliptin (2 mg/kg) in a number of animal models was reported (61% in mice, 76% in rats, 100% in dogs and 68% in
monkeys). details of auc, t1/2, clearance, cmax etc are provided in table 5. a recent report disclosed that adverse effects such as nausea and vomiting were associated with sitagliptin following a single oral dose in an ogtt study [84].
in lean mice, an oral dose of 1 mg/kg resulted in a plasma
drug concentration of 190 nm at 80 min post-dose with a
69% plasma  xxxg651xxx  inhibition. the corresponding values
following a 3 mg/kg dose were 600 nm and 84%. it was
noted that the extent of  xxxg651xxx  inhibition determined in the
in vitro assay underestimated that obtained in vivo. this discrepancy was due to the competitive, rapid and reversible
inhibiting properties of sitagliptin and the fact that the activity assay requires plasma (and hence inhibitor) dilution, and

the presence of a substrate, which competes with the inhibitor for enzyme binding. preclinical data suggests that sitagliptin may have a longer duration of action than  xxxd3510xxx , as its t1/2 in monkeys is 2-fold higher than that of
 xxxd3510xxx  [80]. sitagliptin is superior to  xxxd3510xxx  in
terms of  xxxg651xxx  selectivity, and if any resulting off-target
effects with the inhibition of other dpp subtypes prove to be
associated with adverse events, then sitagliptin may have a
competitive edge over  xxxd3510xxx . however, the absence of
serious side effects in clinical studies of  xxxd3510xxx  indicates that the difference in selectivity between various inhibitors may likely be more of academic than clinical importance. other reported side effects associated with the use of
sitagliptin include stuffy or runny nose, sore throat, upper
respiratory tract infection, stomach pain, diarrhea and headache [85]. sitagliptin was generally well tolerated and provided effective glycemic control in patients with t2dm and
moderate to severe renal insufficiency, including patients
with end stage renal disease (esrd) on dialysis [86].
k- 579
treatment with k579 at a dose of 1 mg/kg inhibited the
plasma  xxxg651xxx  activity even 8 h after the administration and
significantly suppressed the blood glucose elevation in
 xxxd2215xxx -pretreated wistar rats without marked hypoglycemia, and it was observed that the combination treatment of k-579 and su was more effective than  xxxd2215xxx  alone [49, 50].
 xxxd2487xxx  ( xxxd2487xxx )
 xxxd2487xxx  is a long acting  xxxg651xxx  inhibitor that showed
approximately 90% inhibition of  xxxg651xxx  at doses of 3 and
10 mg/kg and 70% inhibition at a dose of 1.0 mg/kg
throughout a 7 h study period. even 24 h after dosing, it
showed  50% inhibition of  xxxg651xxx  [57]. long lasting effect
of  xxxd2487xxx  was also observed during ogtt. glucose excursion was significantly reduced by ~50% and 20-30% when
challenged with glucose at 45 min or 16 h respectively after
dosing with  xxxd2487xxx  (1 mg/kg). this long lasting effect on
glucose tolerance, distinguished  xxxd2487xxx  from the other dpp
iv inhibitors under investigation and/or in clinical trials. in
comparison with other inhibitors of this class,  xxxd2487xxx  exhibited a persistent  xxxg651xxx  activity over a period of 24 h [57].
ogtt studies in zucker fatty rats with  xxxd2487xxx  (3 mg/kg),
showed an elevation of glp-1 levels. furthermore, active
glp-1 levels were found to remain same at elevated basal
levels after glucose-induced peak. this observation was not
consistent with insulin levels, where administration of  xxxd2487xxx  did not increase basal insulin levels before glucose
challenge. this effect was due to the tight binding and long
lasting inhibition of  xxxg651xxx  by  xxxd2487xxx , which leads to accumulation of minor amounts of glp-1 soon after dosing
and before glucose stimuli. overnight fasted animals,
showed that the concentration of active glp-1 in the plasma
remained elevated in animals pretreated with  xxxd2487xxx  as
compared to control animals in all prandial and postprandial
phases throughout the day. it was postulated that increasing
basal glp-1 levels may provide the conditions for -cell
regeneration [87]. thus a drug of this class which causes
increased basal levels of glp-1 even 24 h after dosing could
be more beneficial to t2dm patients.

syr-322 (alogliptin)
alogliptin, (2-[[6-[(3r)-3-amino-1-piperidinyl]-3,4-dihydro-3-methyl-2,4-dioxo-1(2h)-pyrimidinyl] methyl] benzonitrile monobenzoate) is a potent and highly selective (>10,
000 fold selective for  xxxg651xxx  over other closely related proteins) and is currently being evaluated in phase 3 trials [34,
88]. in studies with monkeys it was shown to reduce plasma
 xxxg651xxx  activity with a half-life of 5.7 h and a bioavailability
of 72-88% (dosed at 2, 10 and 30 mg/kg). assessment of
mean peak inhibition of plasma  xxxg651xxx  administered orally
with a dose of 10 mg/kg (in rats), 3 mg/kg (in dogs) and 2-30
mg/kg (in monkeys) showed that the inhibition was greater
than 85, 95 and 80% in rats, dogs and monkeys, respectively.
a sustained  xxxg651xxx  inhibition (80%) at 24 h post dose was
observed in monkeys. it was also found to reduce glucose
excursion following an ogtt in c57bl/6 mice [89]. pk
profile of alogliptin in rats, dogs and monkeys is described
in table 5.
in a clinical study, the drug displayed good efficacy in
reducing glucose levels throughout the day. in a 4 week
ob/ob mice study, alogliptin at 2.8, 14.1 or 42.2 mg/kg/day,
showed a dose dependent (24%, 62% and 80%, respectively)
reduction of plasma  xxxg651xxx  activity and an increase in  xxxg873xxx  levels [92]. in another 4 week study carried out in n-stz
(neonatal-  xxxd3249xxx ) rats with alogliptin, pancreatic
insulin content was elevated by 1.5 fold and hba[1c] was
reduced by 0.2% with a minimum effective dose of 3 mg/kg
[90]. safety results for this multi-dose study showed that
alogliptin was well tolerated in patients with t2dm, with an
incidence of hypoglycemia similar to placebo. no serious
adverse events were reported, and no dose-limiting toxicity
was observed over the entire dose range of 25 to 400 mg
[90]. takeda pharmaceuticals, began the phase 3 trial for this
drug in jan’2006. the results of a single-dose (50 mg) pharmacokinetic study in patients with renal impairment demonstrated an increase in alogliptin exposure compared to
healthy volunteers [91]. the increase in exposure to alogliptin was approximately 1.7, 2.1, 3.2, 3.8 fold in patients
with mild, moderate, severe renal impairment and esrd
patients respectively. the safety and efficacy profiles of
alogliptin as monotherapy and in combination with metformin, pioglitazone,  xxxd2215xxx , and insulin in patients with
t2dm were evaluated in phase 3 clinical trials and results
were presented at the 68th annual scientific sessions of the
american diabetes association (ada) in 2008. coadministration of alogliptin with pioglitazone,  xxxd2215xxx , or
metformin in healthy volunteers resulted in no significant
drug-drug interactions [92-94]. in clinical trials, alogliptin
was well tolerated across a variety of doses and no doselimiting toxicities were observed in 2 published trials. no
patients were withdrawn from these studies because of adverse events [95, 96]. it is claimed that alogliptin may provide some specific advantages due to distinct chemotype
over other  xxxg651xxx  inhibitors currently under advanced developmental stages. in february 2008, a new drug application (nda) was submitted and a response from fda is expected by the year end.
 xxxd3176xxx  ( xxxd3176xxx )
bristol-myers squibb (bms) developed a pyrrolidinebased, oral  xxxg651xxx  inhibitor,  xxxd3176xxx  ( xxxd3176xxx ), for

gupta et al.

a potential once-daily treatment of t2dm. earlier bms investigated a series of  xxxg651xxx  inhibitors with methanoprolinenitrile dipeptide mimetics and observed that these compounds had the highest degree of -branching and greater
stability [31]. in august 2004, preclinical data on  xxxd3176xxx 
were presented at the 228th acs meeting in usa.  xxxd3176xxx  does not inhibit t-cell activity in vivo. the ed50 values after 0.5 and 6 h post-dose were 0.1 and 0.5 m/kg, respectively. in an oral glucose challenge in normal rats treated
with 3 m/kg,  xxxd3176xxx  administration resulted in much
higher glp-1 levels than in the control group. it showed
several beneficial effects in some of the clinical studies. in
another clinical study,  xxxd3176xxx  was found to be safe and
tolerable in a single (100 mg oral dose) or in combination
with metformin (100 mg  xxxd3176xxx  + 1000 mg metformin)
with side effects similar to placebo group [97]. it significantly improved glycemic control (0.7-0.9% reduction in
hba[1c]) and was weight neutral [98]. in another 24-week
phase 3 trial,  xxxd3176xxx , showed significant reduction in all
key measures of glucose control studied like hba[1c], fasting plasma glucose and postprandial glucose when added to
a su or a tzd in patients with inadequately controlled
t2dm [99]. the combination of  xxxd3176xxx  with su or
tzd was well tolerated over the course of the studies, and
significantly more number of patients were able to achieve
the ada recommended target (hba[1c] < 7 %). a nda
was submitted to the u.s. fda and a marketing authorization application to the european medicines agency
(emea) in 2008. phase 3 trials assessing the safety and efficacy of  xxxd3176xxx  involving more than 4,000 patients revealed minor adverse effects like urinary tract infection, nasopharyngitis, upper respiratory tract infection, influenza,
diarrhea, back pain, headache, cough and hypertension. bms
and astrazeneca have proposed the name onglyzatm and
await the approval from fda and emea [99].
amg-222
amg-222 is a  xxxg651xxx  inhibitor and is being evaluated
for the treatment of t2dm. the molecule is currently in a
phase 2a study in collaboration with servier pharmaceuticals, which owns the rights outside the united states [www.
amgen.com]. amgen acquired the rights of this compound in
2007 through acquisition of alantos and is developing this
molecule along with servier. although, information on in
vitro and preclinical data of amg-222 publicly available is
less but, latest studies revealed the drug to be highly selective and to be suitable for once-daily administration [100].
ari-2243
it is a potent  xxxg651xxx  inhibitor that possesses an additional  xxxg651xxx  independent beneficial mechanism which contributes to improved glucose control [101]. ari-2243 produced a 29% reduction in glucose excursion during ogtt
studies in  xxxg651xxx  knock-out mice. in multiple animal models for diabetes, ari-2243 consistently produced dramatic
efficacy results, including a 2.5% reduction of hba[1c] in
zucker diabetic rats [101].
ari-2243 showed improved insulin sensitivity following
14 days of dosing in zucker fa/fa animals whereas sitagliptin
had no effect on insulin sensitivity in this diabetic animal

emerging drug candidates of  xxxg651xxx  inhibitor class

experiment [101]. in mice, ari-2243 showed maximal glucose lowering of approximately 85% with a dose of 0.1
mg/kg compared with about 55% reduction of glucose excursion with sitagliptin  xxxd1891xxx -100 times higher doses. moreover, at 18 h post dose, ari-2243 lowered plasma auc
25%, whereas with no effect was observed with sitagliptin,
demonstrating its long duration of action and the feasibility
of once-daily dosing with ari-2243.
grc 8200 (melogliptin)
melogliptin was originally developed by glenmark
pharmaceuticals ltd. preclinical data suggest that this compound is very potent with an ic50 of 1.61 nm against human
recombinant  xxxg651xxx  enzyme and with a selectivity of
10,000 fold over dpp2, ppce and other proteases tested
[44-45]. melogliptin has an excellent pharmacokinetic profile with a reported oral bioavailability of 50-95% [102]. pk
data of melogliptin is described in table 5. structure
(www.thomson-pharma.com; cas rn, 868771-57-7) is described in table 4. oral administration of melogliptin at a
dose of 3 mg/kg/day in db/db mice resulted in 30% reduction
of auc in ogtt. also, insulin levels were doubled [45]. in
overnight fasted beagle dogs (5 mg/kg po) melogliptin produced a peak concentration of 2.15 g/ml, plasma clearance
of 1.17 l/h/kg. further, plasma  xxxg651xxx  was inhibited by
more than 90 % until 6 hours post administration of the drug
[103]. the results of phase 1 trial suggest that both single
ascending and multiple ascending doses of the drug were
well tolerated with a linear pharmacokinetic profile, supporting once-daily dosing [104-105]. the inhibition of plasma
 xxxg651xxx  was more than 90% within an hour of dosing. currently, melogliptin is in phase 2 trials.
r-1579 (carmegliptin)
both roche and chugai are co-developing r-1579, a
small molecule based  xxxg651xxx  inhibitor as a back up for another  xxxg651xxx  inhibitor r-1438 which was discontinued by
roche [106]. the results of a single center, double-blinded
phase 1 trial suggest that both single ascending and multiple
ascending doses of r-1579 were tolerated with more than 50
% reduction in  xxxg651xxx  activity observed even after 10 hours
of dosing [107]. further, this compound has successfully
completed phase 2 trials in july 2008 and data obtained in
this study suggest that the drug is safe and efficacious and
there was no evidence of weight loss [107].
phx-1149
phx-1149 of phenomix inc. was the lead from a series
of orally active  xxxg651xxx  inhibitors for the potential treatment
of t2dm. in preclinical studies, this compound showed excellent safety and efficacy profile [108]. pharmacokinetic
and pharmacodynamic profile of phx-1149 in a doubleblinded, placebo controlled studies in healthy subjects revealed comparable results [109]. in august 2007, preclinical
data on phx-1149 were presented at the 12th annual drug
discovery and development of innovative therapeutics
meeting in boston, usa. phx-1149 exhibited a half-life of
6 to 7 h in monkeys, 4.1 h in rats, and 3.8 h in dogs with a
tmax of approximately 2.5 h. the compound demonstrated
good microsomal stability, no substantial cyp inhibition,

current drug targets, 2009, vol. 10, no. 1

83

low-protein binding and good metabolic stability. in monkeys (45 mg/kg) phx-1149, inhibited  xxxg651xxx  upto 24 h. pk
and pd studies carried out in dogs and monkeys supported
once-daily dosing regimes in humans. a dose of 9 mg/kg in
dogs and monkeys showed a 50% and 80%  xxxg651xxx  inhibition respectively even after 24 h. phx-1149 exhibited a halflife of 6.3 h, time to cmax was 0.8 h and cmax was 555 ng/ml
and an auc concentration of 2030 h.ng/ml [110]. a 28-day
phase 2a clinical trial of phx-1149 in 174 t2dm patients,
demonstrated that drug was well tolerated and met its primary endpoint of reduction in postprandial glucose levels.
in april 2007, a 12-week phase 2b clinical trial study was
initiated and in may 2008, positive results were reported. in
this combination therapy study with phx-1149 + metformin
or tzd or placebo, 422 patients received 200 or 400 mg of
phx-1149 or placebo once daily plus an optional constant
dose of metformin or a tzd or both [111]. phx-1149 significantly reduced hba[1c] levels in both dose groups with
significant effects on fasting and post-meal blood glucose
levels and also achieved hba[1c] levels of <7% [112]. the
drug was also safe and well tolerated.
8. selectivity issues of  xxxg651xxx  inhibitors
 xxxg651xxx  is a member of a family of serine peptidases that
includes other related members like quiescent cell proline
dipeptidase ( xxxd1180xxx /dpp2), dpp6, dpp8, dpp9, and dpp10.
the catalytic regions of these enzymes show similarity to
each other and therefore a  xxxg651xxx  inhibitor may also inhibit
the related enzymes in body to a certain extent. for example,
the  xxxg651xxx  inhibitor val-boro-pro appears to be relatively
nonselective for  xxxg651xxx  as it may also inhibit fap, dpp8,
dpp9 and dpp2 [113]. functions of other family members
and their clinical importance are unclear at present. lankas
et al. [113] found that administration of dpp8/9 inhibitor
produced alopecia, thrombocytopenia, reticulocytopenia,
enlarged spleen, multiorgan histopathological changes, and
mortality in rats and gi toxicities in dogs. the  xxxd1180xxx  inhibitor
was found to produce reticulocytopenia in rats, but selective
 xxxg651xxx  inhibitor exhibited no toxicities in these species.
moreover dpp8/9 inhibitor attenuated t-cell activation in
human in vitro models. based on the above preclinical study
data, it was perceived that selective inhibitors of  xxxg651xxx 
may be a safe clinical candidate for t2dm [113].
while selective inhibition of  xxxg651xxx  over dpp8/9 is desirable it is however not clear what should be the degree of
selectivity towards  xxxg651xxx  inhibition for a compound to
become a pharmacologically safe drug? the fold selectivity
data of few  xxxg651xxx  inhibitors is summarized in table 6. a
recent study carried out in rodents with  xxxd3510xxx  (a less
selective  xxxg651xxx  inhibitor over dpp 8/9) revealed no toxicities that were reported earlier with selective dpp 8/9 inhibition [114]. it maybe concluded that the observed toxicities
maybe due to a mechanism other than dpp 8/9 inhibition.
thus, very high selectivity for  xxxg651xxx  over dpp 8/9 may
not be an absolute prerequisite for developing efficacious
 xxxg651xxx  inhibitors with acceptable safety profiles and further
extensive studies should be performed to understand the importance of dpp 8/9. comparison of in vivo efficacy of selected  xxxg651xxx  inhibitors is summarized in table 7.

9. short-acting versus long-acting  xxxg651xxx 
inhibitors

10. current opinion on  xxxg651xxx  inhibitors vs
glp-1 analogs

a number of  xxxg651xxx  inhibitors are now in the late stages
of clinical development. they have different properties, in
terms of their duration of action and hence anticipated dosing frequency. considering that active glp-1 is short lived
(t1/2<1min) and  xxxg651xxx  enzyme that inactivates glp-1 is
involved in regulating other physiological functions, short
acting  xxxg651xxx  inhibitors maybe preferred over long acting
 xxxg651xxx  inhibitors to minimize any potential side effects.
however, the duration of  xxxg651xxx  inhibition should be long
enough to reduce the post prandial glucose excursion, yet
sufficient enough to allow time for the activities of other
endogenous  xxxg651xxx  substrates to restore to their normal
levels [115]. to overcome this limitation short acting dpp
iv inhibitors maybe administered along with meals (b.i.d/
t.i.d). however, issues such as cost and dosing convenience
may outweigh the benefits of short acting over long acting
 xxxg651xxx  inhibitors, provided that long term inhibition of dpp
iv does not lead to toxicities. further studies should be conducted to better understand which type of drug would be
beneficial to treat t2dm with minimal side effects.

both  xxxg651xxx  and glp-1 based therapeutic approaches
have been approved by fda for t2dm. so the emerging
question is that which one of these two approaches is more
beneficial? current evidence suggests that both  xxxg651xxx  inhibitors and glp-1 analogs may exhibit beneficial actions on
the pancreatic islets, acting to preserve -cell mass via opposing effects on proliferation and apoptosis. however, dpp
iv inhibitors are small, orally bioavailable low-molecularweight compounds but they are without any inherent antidiabetic activity of their own and hence their therapeutic
effect is reliant on enhancing the activity of glp-1 and gip
whereas all glp-1 analogs are based on a naturally occurring, relatively large peptide with inherent anti-diabetic activity. currently there are no small-molecule glp-1 mimetic
drugs available for oral administration and thus they must be
given parenterally. researchers in many industries and academic labs are working on development of oral small molecule agonists of  xxxg899xxx  to overcome the existing
limitation (injectable and less stable) of glp-1 based therapy. although glp-1 based therapy offers physiological

emerging drug candidates of  xxxg651xxx  inhibitor class

benefits, but it is also associated with adverse events like
hypoglycemia, nausea etc as observed in human clinical trials. further, modified glp-1 peptide based analogs are potentially immunogenic. however, none of the compounds
under investigation were reported to elicit any antibody response and thus the potential side effects of glp-1 mimetics
need to be evaluated further in long term studies. the antihyperglycemic effects of  xxxg651xxx  inhibitors is glucosedependent meaning that the stimulation of insulin release by
these compounds depends upon elevated ambient blood glucose levels and hence there may not be a potential risk of
hypoglycemia. however, long-acting  xxxg651xxx  resistant  xxxg873xxx  analogs may cause hypoglycemia and thus dose regimen to
be administered should be monitored carefully. moreover, in
rodents it was reported that, sustained glp-1 elevation leads
to undesirable effects like increased heart rate and blood
pressure, however the same was not observed in human trials
in studies with  xxxg651xxx  resistant glp-1 analogs [24]. although both glp-1 and  xxxg651xxx  inhibitor based therapies
have been approved to be clinically efficacious as monotherapy but  xxxg651xxx  inhibitor combination therapy (with tzd’s,
su or biguanides) may be a safer therapeutic approach.
glp-1 analog based therapy causes reduction in body
weight, which has not been observed in  xxxg651xxx  inhibition
based therapy. considering all the above facts,  xxxg651xxx  inhibitors possess more advantages (orally bioavailable, small
molecular weight, low hypoglycemic risk, weight neutral
etc) over glp-1 analogs, but the long-term effects of dpp
iv inhibitors in t2dm patients need to be explored because
of its role in regulation of other physiological hormones,
neuropeptides, chemokines and many other substrates listed
in table 1.
an important thing to mention here is that metformin (a
drug with multiple anti-diabetic mechanisms) was reported
to inhibit  xxxg651xxx , this strengthens the long-term safety of
 xxxg651xxx  inhibitors as metformin is available as a therapy for
treatment of t2dm since 1950s [116]. currently, sitagliptin
is the only fda-approved  xxxg651xxx  inhibitor. however, the
market may get crowded with other  xxxg651xxx  inhibitors that
are near approval, including  xxxd3176xxx  and alogliptin suggesting that  xxxg651xxx  inhibition is a safe and effective therapy
for t2dm.

current drug targets, 2009, vol. 10, no. 1

been demonstrated in humans [120]. moreover,  xxxg651xxx  inhibitors are weight neutral and have a negligible risk of hypoglycemia. thus  xxxg651xxx  inhibitors have an advantage over
other anti-diabetic agents like long-acting glp-1 analogs,
tzds, sus, biguanides etc.

11. concluding remarks
in general, the safety profile of most of the  xxxg651xxx  inhibitors under evaluation and those for which studies have
been completed are encouraging. while they do not lower
glucose to a greater extent (as monotherapy) than existing
therapies, they are more effective in combination with other
drugs like tzd, su or biguanides and thus in a combination
therapy adverse effects associated with existing therapies can
be avoided to a certain extent.  xxxg651xxx  inhibitors like  xxxd3510xxx  [78] and sitagliptin [80] are well tolerated and have
demonstrated the ability to cause sustained reductions in
hba[1c] with negligible risk of hypoglycemia. older therapies for t2dm do not prevent -cell apoptosis and thus
newer agents with complementary modes of action and the
potential to prevent -cell damage could be of great interest.
there is enough evidence based on animal studies that dpp
iv inhibitors can preserve and even reverse the progressive
loss of insulin secretion capacity, although this has not yet
