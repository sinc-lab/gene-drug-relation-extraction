introduction

strict glycaemic control in patients with type 1 or type 2 diabetes
mellitus (t1dm and t2dm) reduces the occurrence and
progression of microvascular and macrovascular disease [1].
the intensive approaches required to achieve adequate
glycaemic control can be associated with a 2–3-fold increased
risk of severe hypoglycaemia [2]. treatment options for patients
with t2dm have improved with the introduction of the longacting insulin analogues,  xxxd2362xxx  and insulin  xxxd2361xxx 
[3,4]. both analogues were designed to provide a constant basal

insulin supply that mimics the physiological post-absorptive
basal insulin secretion better than isophane insulin. indeed,
data from randomised, controlled studies have indicated that
once-daily  xxxd2362xxx  (for t1dm and t2dm) and twice-daily
 xxxd2361xxx  (for t1dm only) provided glycaemic control that was at
least comparable to isophane insulin, with the advantage of
lower rates of nocturnal hypoglycaemia [5–13].
on subcutaneous injection, there are clear differences in
the pharmacokinetic profiles of  xxxd2362xxx  and  xxxd2361xxx  due to
their unique primary structures.  xxxd2362xxx  is completely
soluble at the ph of its injection solution (ph 4) and forms

microprecipitates at physiological ph after injection, before
gradually diffusing into the bloodstream. as a result,  xxxd2362xxx 
has 24 h duration of action, which facilitates once-daily dosing
[3]. the prolonged duration of action of  xxxd2361xxx  (up to 24 h) is
accounted for by two mechanisms (namely, reversible binding
to plasma albumin and, to a lesser extent, self-association at
the injection site) [4].
pharmacodynamically,  xxxd2362xxx  is equipotent to human
insulin in binding to the  xxxg1194xxx  (ir) [14–16], and it
promotes comparable glucose uptake to  xxxd2364xxx 
[17,18]. in contrast,  xxxd2361xxx  is approximately 50% less potent
than  xxxd2364xxx  at binding the ir in vitro [16,19], which
may partly explain its reduced effectiveness on a molar basis
in humans [20]. while the receptor pharmacology of  xxxd2362xxx 
and  xxxd2361xxx  has been well characterised, the downstream
signalling processes activated after binding in metabolic and
proliferative target cells remain totally enigmatic. although
 xxxd2361xxx  appears to be less active compared to  xxxd2364xxx 
based on the prescribing information, direct comparisons
have not yet been reported in cultured cells. furthermore,
clarification of mitogenic properties of these long-acting
insulin analogues would be of particular importance for
long-term safe clinical use. toward this end, we directly
compared the metabolic and mitogenic effects of  xxxd2362xxx  and
 xxxd2361xxx  to  xxxd2364xxx  in a range of cultured cells.

cell culture

all procedures involving animals were conducted according to
the national institutes of health guide for the care and use of
laboratory animals [21] and were approved by the animal

research committee at the university of toyama. we
employed four types of representative cultured cells frequently used as the model of adipocytes, skeletal muscle cells,
hepatocytes, and vascular smooth muscle cells (vsmcs) in
target tissues of insulin. all cultured cells were serum-starved
for 16 h and subsequently treated with various concentrations
of  xxxd2364xxx ,  xxxd2362xxx  and  xxxd2361xxx  at 37 8c for 10 min.
3t3-l1 adipocytes were grown and passaged in dmem
supplemented with 10% donor calf serum. cells at 2–3 days
post-confluence were used for differentiation. the differentiation medium contained 10% fcs, 250 nm dexamethasone,
0.5 mm isobutyl methylxanthine and 500 nm insulin. after 3
days, this medium was replaced with a post-differentiation
medium containing 10% fcs and 500 nm insulin. after 3
further days of incubation, the post-differentiation medium
was replaced with dmem supplemented with 10% fcs. 3t3-l1
adipocytes 10–12 days after initial differentiation were used
for the experiments [22].
l6 myocytes, kindly provided by dr. a. klip (hospital for
sick children, toronto, on, canada), were grown and
passaged in a-mem supplemented with 10% fcs. the
confluent cells were used for differentiation in culture
medium containing 2% fcs [23].
hepatocytes were isolated from the livers of male sprague–
dawley rats (8 weeks old) with the use of collagenase. the
isolated hepatocytes were seeded at a density of 2.6  106 cells
per 60 mm dish (coated with rat collagen-i) in medium a
(medium 199 containing earle’s salt, penicillin (100 u/ml) and
streptomycin (100 mg/ml)) supplemented with 10% fcs, 100 nm
dexamethasone, 1 nm insulin and 100 nm triiodothyronine [24].
vsmcs were prepared from the thoracic aortas of male
sprague–dawley rats (8 weeks old) as described previously
[21]. rat aortic vsmcs were cultured in dmem supplemented
with 10% fcs, and the growth medium was changed every 2
days. cultured cells were confirmed as being vsmcs by
immunostaining with smooth muscle a-actin. vsmcs at 2–5
passages were used for experiments.

2.3.

immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting

cells were lysed in a buffer containing 20 mm tris, 150 mm
nacl, 1 mm edta, 1 mm egta, 2.5 mm sodium  xxxd1835xxx ,
1 mm b-glycerophosphate, 1% nonidet p40 (np40), 1 mm
phenylmethylsulfonylfluoride (pmsf), 1 mm na3vo4, 50 mm
sodium fluoride, 10 mg/ml aprotinin and 10 mm leupeptin at ph
7.4, for 30 min at 4 8c. the lysates were centrifuged to remove
insoluble materials. the supernatants (100 mg of protein) were
immunoprecipitated with antibodies for 2 h at 4 8c. the
precipitates and the lysates were then separated by sdspage (7.5%) and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride
membranes using a bio-rad apparatus (hercules, ca, usa).
the membranes were blocked for 2 h at 20 8c in 2.5% bsa or 5%
non-fat milk, in tris-buffered saline (tbs; 50 mm tris, 150 mm
nacl, ph 7.5) plus 0.1% tween 20. the membranes were then
probed with antibodies for 2 h at 20 8c or for 16 h at 4 8c. after
the membranes were washed in tbs plus 0.1% tween 20, they
were incubated with a horseradish peroxidase-linked secondary antibody and detected by enhanced chemiluminescence according to the manufacturer’s instructions (ge health
science bio-science corp., tokyo, japan) [22].

glucose uptake

l6 myocytes and 3t3-l1 adipocytes were grown to confluence
in six-well multiplates and were incubated in krb-hepes
buffer (10 mm hepes, 131.2 mm nacl, 4.7 mm kcl, 1.2 mm
 xxxd2534xxx , 2.5 mm cacl2 and 2.5 mm nah2po4) with indicated
concentrations of bsa (ph 7.4) for 2 h. the cells were
stimulated with various concentrations of  xxxd2364xxx ,
 xxxd2362xxx  and  xxxd2361xxx  (0–170 nm) for 15 min, and then 2[3h]dog (0.1 mm; 0.4 kbq/well) was added for 4 min. the
reaction was stopped by the addition of 10 mm cytochalasin b.
the cells were washed three times with ice-cold pbs and
solubilised with 0.2% sds–0.2 m naoh. the radioactivity
incorporated into the cells was measured by liquid scintillation counting [22,23]. the results were corrected for nonspecific uptake determined by 2-[3h]dog uptake in the
presence of 10 mm cytochalasin b. non-specific uptake was
less than 10% of the total uptake.

2.5.

dna synthesis assay

serum-starved aortic smooth muscle cells grown in 96-well
plates were incubated with  xxxd2364xxx ,  xxxd2362xxx  and
 xxxd2361xxx  (0–170 nm). the cells were then treated with 10 mm 5bromo-2’-deoxyuridine (brdu) for 3 h. brdu incorporation into
dna was measured by a colorimetric reaction with peroxidase-linked anti-brdu antibody using a cell proliferation
elisa kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions (roche,
mannheim, germany) [25].

2.6.

statistical analysis

the significance of differences was assessed by anova
followed by dunnett’s test. values of p less than 0.05 were
considered to be significant.

however, at 17 nm, insulin and  xxxd2362xxx  both generally
saturated signalling. in adipocytes (at a concentration of
1.7 nm, a concentration where enzyme kinetics appeared
linear),  xxxd2361xxx -induced phosphorylation of the ir,  xxxg1198xxx , akt
and gsk3 were 86%, 28%, 57% and 16% lower than those induced
by  xxxd2364xxx , respectively fig. 2. in l6 myocytes, insulin
and  xxxd2362xxx  showed maximal activity at 17 nm, whereas the
maximal response for  xxxd2361xxx  was observed at 170 nm. the
dose–response curve of  xxxd2361xxx -induced phosphorylation was
shifted to the right, with decreased maximal response relative
to  xxxd2364xxx  and  xxxd2362xxx .  xxxd2361xxx  (170 nm) induced
phosphorylation of the ir,  xxxg1198xxx , akt and gsk3 that was 26%,
41%, 36% and 15% lower than that induced by  xxxd2364xxx ,
respectively. at concentrations of 1.7 nm, the corresponding
phosphorylation of ir,  xxxg1198xxx , akt and gsk3 induced by  xxxd2361xxx 
was 74%, 74%, 60% and 33% lower, respectively (fig. 3 and suppl.
fig. 1). in hepatocytes, the phosphorylation of ir,  xxxg1198xxx , akt and
gsk3 by  xxxd2361xxx  (1.7 nm) relative to  xxxd2364xxx  (1.7 nm) was
43%, 49%, 24% and 13% lower, respectively (fig. 3 and suppl. fig.
2). similarly in vsmcs, the rightward shift in the dose–response
curve of  xxxd2361xxx -induced phosphorylation was accompanied
by a decreased maximal response relative to  xxxd2364xxx  and
 xxxd2362xxx .  xxxd2361xxx  (170 nm) induced phosphorylation of the ir,
 xxxg1198xxx , akt and gsk3 that was decreased by 31%, 40%, 41% and
14%, respectively, compared with  xxxd2364xxx  (fig. 3 and
suppl. fig. 3).

3.3.

glucose uptake in l6 myocytes

 xxxd2364xxx  and  xxxd2362xxx  were similar in their dosedependent stimulation of glucose uptake (effective dose 50
[ed50]:  xxxd2364xxx  at 0.07  0.02 nm and  xxxd2362xxx  at
0.06  0.02 nm), with maximal response obtained at a concentration of 1.7 nm for both proteins. in contrast, the ed50 for
 xxxd2361xxx  was higher at 0.40  0.11 nm and the maximal
response was obtained at a 10-fold higher concentration
(17 nm) than that observed for  xxxd2364xxx  and  xxxd2362xxx 
(fig. 3d).

the time course of  xxxd2364xxx -,  xxxd2362xxx - and detemirinduced intracellular signalling in l6 myocytes is shown in
fig. 1, which is representative for the other cell types tested.
the phosphorylation kinetics of  xxxg1198xxx , akt, and gsk3 and
mapk after induction by 17 nm  xxxd2364xxx ,  xxxd2362xxx  and
 xxxd2361xxx  occurred in a similar timeframe, although at a
reduced level for  xxxd2361xxx  (fig. 1). maximal phosphorylation
occurred at 5 min for  xxxg1198xxx  and  xxxd1891xxx  min for akt, gsk3 and
mapk.

3.2.

intracellular signalling kinetics

a common trend was observed across all cell types. human
insulin- and  xxxd2362xxx -induced comparable dose-dependent
phosphorylations of the ir,  xxxg1198xxx , akt and gsk3 are shown in
figs. 2–3. in contrast, the dose–response curves of detemirinduced phosphorylations were all shifted to the right.
in adipocytes and hepatocytes at a concentration of 170 nm,
maximal responses were similar among the insulin analogues;

map kinase phosphorylation

 xxxd2364xxx  induced phosphorylation of mapk in a dosedependent manner in 3t3-l1 adipocytes, l6 myocytes, rat
primary cultured hepatocytes and vsmcs (fig. 4 and suppl.
fig. 2).  xxxd2362xxx  induced phosphorylation of mapk in a
comparable dose-dependent manner to  xxxd2364xxx , and
demonstrated a comparable maximal response in all of the
cultured cells.  xxxd2361xxx  stimulated phosphorylation of mapk
in a comparable dose-dependent manner (with maximal
responsiveness) to  xxxd2364xxx  in hepatocytes only. in
3t3-l1 adipocytes, the dose–response curve was shifted to the
right but with a similar maximum response as that of insulin.
in l6 myocytes and vsmcs,  xxxd2361xxx -induced phosphorylation
of mapk was both markedly shifted to the right and had an
apparently decreased maximum response compared with
insulin.

3.5.

brdu incorporation into vsmcs

 xxxd2364xxx - and  xxxd2362xxx -induced incorporation of brdu
into vsmcs was dose-dependent and quantitatively comparable. the maximum incorporation of brdu stimulated by
 xxxd2361xxx  was slightly lower than  xxxd2364xxx , although the
difference was not significant (fig. 4d).

3.6.
effect of bsa on  xxxg1194xxx  phosphorylation and
glucose uptake in 3t3-l1 adipocytes
the prolonged duration of action of  xxxd2361xxx  occurs through
the reversible binding of the active drug to albumin [4].
however, the effect of albumin concentration in target tissues
on the biological activity of  xxxd2361xxx  is not known. we
therefore examined the effect of bsa concentration on insulin
receptor phosphorylation and glucose uptake induced by
 xxxd2361xxx ,  xxxd2362xxx  and  xxxd2364xxx . the presence of bsa in
the culture medium had no detectable effect on human
insulin- and  xxxd2362xxx -induced phosphorylation of the insulin
receptor in 3t3-l1 adipocytes. however, despite using 10-fold
higher concentrations of  xxxd2361xxx , phosphorylation of the
 xxxg1194xxx  by  xxxd2361xxx  was significantly reduced by
increasing concentrations of bsa; this effect was significant at
bsa concentrations 0.5%. at 2.5% bsa, the activity of  xxxd2361xxx 
was 25% of its activity in 0% bsa (fig. 5a).
 xxxd2364xxx - and  xxxd2362xxx -induced glucose uptake in
3t3-l1 adipocytes was not significantly affected by the
presence of 0.1% and 2.5% bsa. in contrast, the dose–response
curve of  xxxd2361xxx -stimulated glucose uptake was shifted to the
right at both bsa concentrations. although maximal responsiveness was attained by  xxxd2361xxx  in the presence of 0.1% bsa,
this was not the case in the presence of 2.5% bsa. in 2.5% bsa,

discussion

we examined activation by  xxxd2364xxx  and the long-acting
insulin analogues,  xxxd2362xxx  and  xxxd2361xxx , of key signalling
molecules involved in the control of blood glucose levels, cell
growth and cell differentiation. against all measures in each
cell type, the pharmacodynamics of  xxxd2362xxx  approximated
those of  xxxd2364xxx , whereas the effects of  xxxd2361xxx  were
more variable and generally less pronounced. specifically,
 xxxd2362xxx  and  xxxd2364xxx  stimulated the autophosphorylation of the  xxxg1194xxx  to a similar extent, which evoked
comparable downstream phosphorylations of  xxxg1198xxx , akt and
gsk3. on a per molar basis,  xxxd2361xxx -induced phosphorylation
of the  xxxg1194xxx  was markedly lower than that of
 xxxd2364xxx  and  xxxd2362xxx , resulting in less intense signal
transduction ( xxxd2361xxx -induced phosphorylations of  xxxg1198xxx , akt
and gsk3 were 12–86% lower than those induced by human
insulin and  xxxd2362xxx ). consistent with these findings,  xxxd2362xxx -

stimulated glucose uptake was similar to that seen with
 xxxd2364xxx  at equivalent concentrations, while detemirstimulated glucose uptake was substantially lower. a similar
trend was observed for the phosphorylation of mapk in 3t3-l1
adipocytes, l6 myocytes and vsmcs. however, the reduced
phosphorylation of mapk induced by  xxxd2361xxx  compared with
phosphorylation induced by  xxxd2362xxx  was more marked in l6
myocytes and vsmcs than in 3t3-l1 adipocytes. these
differences in the effect of  xxxd2362xxx  and  xxxd2361xxx  on mapk
phosphorylation in different cell types may be related to
differences in the expression of the insulin-like growth factor1 receptor between the cell lines. this question will need to be
explored in future studies.
the data generated in this study are internally consistent;
the extent of  xxxg1194xxx  phosphorylation in all four types
of cell was directly related to signal transduction strength, as
assessed by measuring  xxxg1198xxx , akt, gsk3 phosphorylation and,
ultimately, glucose uptake. the extent to which  xxxd2362xxx  and
 xxxd2361xxx  induced phosphorylation of the  xxxg1194xxx  is
corroborated by receptor binding data showing that  xxxd2362xxx 
and  xxxd2364xxx  have a similar affinity for the insulin
receptor, while the affinity of  xxxd2361xxx  is approximately 50%
lower [14–19]. as the extent of glucose uptake stimulated by
 xxxd2362xxx  and  xxxd2364xxx  was similar in this study, as well

*p < 0.05 vs. amounts of phosphorylated  xxxg1369xxx  or brdu incorporation by insulin at respective concentrations.

as in others [17,18], it appears that the activation of downstream targets is similar for  xxxd2362xxx  and  xxxd2364xxx .
the difference in the amount of phosphorylated  xxxg1198xxx , akt,
gsk3 and mapk produced by  xxxd2364xxx  and  xxxd2362xxx 
relative to  xxxd2361xxx  cannot be explained by differential kinetic
processes, as phosphorylation rates were comparable across
all times tested in l6 myocytes. it is likely that the c14 fatty
acid attached to the b29lys side chain of  xxxd2361xxx  sterically
hinders its binding to the  xxxg1194xxx  recognition site,
resulting in weaker signal transduction [16]. interestingly,
despite the rightward shift in dose–response curves for
 xxxd2361xxx , maximal phosphorylations of the  xxxg1198xxx , akt and
gsk3 were attained by this analogue at a concentration of
170 nm in adipocytes and hepatocytes cells. although maximal glucose uptake was also observed for  xxxd2361xxx  in l6
myocytes, this was achieved  xxxd1891xxx -fold higher concentrations
than that of  xxxd2364xxx  and  xxxd2362xxx . these results clearly
indicate that the low potency of  xxxd2361xxx  at same molar basis is
due to decreased biological action in target cells and not due to
a process of altered subcutaneous absorption. these data also
imply that, in specific tissues, the relatively low potency of
 xxxd2361xxx  for the ir can be overcome clinically by substantially
increasing the dose. in commercial preparations, much higher
concentrations of  xxxd2361xxx  are used compared with most other
insulin formulations (2400 nmol/ml for  xxxd2361xxx  compared
with 600 nmol/ml for neutral protamine hagedorn [nph]).

therefore, one unit of insulin  xxxd2361xxx  contains four times the
insulin dose of one international unit of nph insulin on a
molar basis. in this clinical setting,  xxxd2361xxx  and  xxxd2364xxx 
appeared to possess similar potency for the metabolic
signalling in the skeletal muscle and liver, whereas brain
action of  xxxd2361xxx  was enhanced [26].
the long-term clinical implications of exposing patients to
higher concentrations of insulin  xxxd2361xxx  should be considered. for example, a promotion of atherosclerosis or a
formation of anti-insulin antibody may be a possible concern
with  xxxd2361xxx , whereas short-term studies comparing with
nph have not suggested an increased risk. in this regard,
 xxxd2362xxx  possesses the same mitogenic signalling properties as
 xxxd2364xxx , since both  xxxd2362xxx  and  xxxd2364xxx 
induced phosphorylation of map kinase to a similar extent
in all cells and stimulated brdu incorporation into vsmcs
similarly. consistently, previously published data indicate
that  xxxd2362xxx  has the same mitogenic potency as human
insulin in cultured muscle cells and rat-1 fibroblasts [17,18].
it should also be noted that observations in the current
report were mostly performed with serum-starved cells.
when bsa was added to the medium at a concentration of

0.1% bsa concentration.

ylation of ir or glucose uptake,  xxxd2362xxx  may have greater
clinical value than  xxxd2361xxx  in patients with unstable albumin
concentrations such as those with infectious diseases or
undergoing surgery.
the complex signal transduction cascade that becomes
activated after stimulation of the ir has become an intense area
of research [27]. phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase [pi(3)k] is known
to play a central role in exerting the metabolic and mitogenic
actions of insulin [28]. after interaction of its src homology-2
(sh2) domains with tyrosine-phosphorylated irs proteins,
pi(3)k phosphorylates the catalytic domain of akt, which in
turn transmits multiple signals that culminate in glucose
transporter-4 (glut4) translocation to the cell surface [29]. one of
the key metabolic signals involves akt-induced inhibition
of gsk3, which leads to the activation of glycogen synthase
[30–33]. therefore, both  xxxd2364xxx  and  xxxd2362xxx  and, to a
lesser extent,  xxxd2361xxx  lower blood glucose by stimulating
glyconeogenesis as well as promoting glucose uptake.

it is notable that our study specifically evaluated the
effects of  xxxd2362xxx  and  xxxd2361xxx  on pivotal adaptor molecules
within the pi(3)k pathway in target cells. future research
will focus on the effects of these analogues on the parallel
cap/cbl/tc10 pathway, which is known to induce full
glucose uptake after activation by phosphorylated insulin
receptors [34]. similarly, elucidation of the extracellular
signal-regulated kinase pathway and its modulation by
long-acting insulin analogues warrants further study.
although this cascade does not seem to be implicated in
the immediate response of the cell to insulin exposure, it is
strongly associated with the development of insulin
resistance [35].
in conclusion, we have demonstrated that metabolic and
mitogenic effects of  xxxd2362xxx  were quantitatively similar to
that of  xxxd2364xxx  in target cultured cells, inferring that
this analogue shares a common mechanism of action to the
natural hormone.  xxxd2361xxx  was less potent than  xxxd2362xxx  with

respect to ir phosphorylation, which resulted in weaker signal
transduction via pi(3)k and reduced glucose uptake. the
presence of bsa had no effect on  xxxd2362xxx -mediated changes,
but impaired  xxxd2361xxx -mediated changes even at subphysiological concentrations. the effects of these analogues on other
intracellular signalling pathways in a range of clinically
relevant cells require study to allow better understanding of
their mode of action in the treatment of diabetes.
