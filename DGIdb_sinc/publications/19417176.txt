topiramate reduces excitability in the basolateral amygdala by selectively inhibiting  xxxg958xxx  ( xxxg958xxx ) kainate receptors on interneurons and positivel...  topiramate [ xxxd3400xxx ] is a structurally novel antiepileptic drug that has broad efficacy in epilepsy, but the mechanisms underlying its therapeutic activity are not fully understood. we have found that topiramate selectively inhibits  xxxg958xxx  ( xxxg958xxx ) kainate receptor-mediated excitatory postsynaptic responses in rat basolateral amygdala (bla) principal neurons and protects against seizures induced by the  xxxg958xxx  kainate receptor agonist (r,s)-2-amino-3-(3-hydroxy-5-tert-butylisoxazol-4-yl) xxxd3029xxx  (atpa). here, we demonstrate that topiramate also modulates inhibitory function in the bla. using whole-cell recordings in rat amygdala slices, we found that 0.3 to 10 microm topiramate 1) inhibited atpa-evoked postsynaptic currents recorded from bla interneurons; 2) suppressed atpa-induced enhancement of spontaneous inhibitory postsynaptic currents (ipscs) recorded from bla pyramidal cells; and 3) blocked atpa-induced suppression of evoked ipscs, which is mediated by presynaptic  xxxg958xxx  kainate receptors present on bla interneurons. topiramate (10 microm) had no effect on the ampa [(r,s)-alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid]-induced enhancement of spontaneous activity of bla neurons. thus, although topiramate inhibits  xxxg958xxx  kainate receptor-mediated enhancement of interneuron firing, it promotes evoked gaba release, leading to a net inhibition of circuit excitability. in addition, we found that topiramate (0.3-10 microm) increased the amplitude of evoked, spontaneous, and miniature ipscs in bla pyramidal neurons, indicating an enhancement of postsynaptic gaba(a) receptor responses. taken together with our previous findings, we conclude that topiramate protects against hyperexcitability in the bla by suppressing the  xxxg958xxx  kainate receptor-mediated excitation of principal neurons by glutamatergic afferents, blocking the suppression of gaba release from interneurons mediated by presynaptic  xxxg958xxx  kainate receptors and directly enhancing gaba(a) receptor-mediated inhibitory currents.
