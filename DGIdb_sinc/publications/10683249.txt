quinone oxidoreductases are flavoproteins that catalyze two-electron reduction and detoxification of quinones. this leads to the protection of cells against
toxicity, mutagenicity, and cancer due to exposure to
environmental and synthetic quinones and its precursors. two cytosolic forms of quinone oxidoreductases
[ xxxg1592xxx  ( xxxg1592xxx ) and
 xxxg1593xxx  ( xxxg1593xxx )] were previously identified, purified, and cloned. a role of cytosolic  xxxg1592xxx  in protection of cells from oxidative stress,
cytotoxicity, and mutagenicity of quinones was established. currently, we have characterized and partially
purified the nqo activity from rat liver microsomes.
this activity was designated as microsomal nqo
(mnqo). the mnqo activity showed significantly
higher affinity for nadh than nadph as electron donors and catalyzed reduction of 2,6-dichlorophenolindophenol and  xxxd2563xxx . the mnqo activity was insensitive to  xxxd1875xxx , a potent inhibitor of cytosolic
 xxxg1592xxx . western analysis of microsomal proteins revealed 29- and 18-kda bands that cross-reacted with
polyclonal antibodies raised against cytosolic  xxxg1592xxx .
the mnqo activity was partially purified by solubilization of microsomes with detergent chaps, ammonium sulfate fractionation, and deae-sephacel column chromatography. the microsomal mnqo proteins are expected to provide additional protection
after cytosolic nqos against quinone toxicity and mutagenicity. © 2000 academic press

organic materials, including automobile exhaust, cigarette smoke, and urban air particulates (1). they are
also found naturally in many foods we eat and compounds containing the quinoid nucleus are widely employed as antitumor agents. quinones are highly reactive molecules and readily undergo either one- or twoelectron reduction. one-electron reduction of quinones
and its derivatives by enzymes such as cytochromes
p450 and cytochrome p450 reductase generates unstable semiquinones which undergo redox cycling in the
presence of molecular oxygen, leading to the formation
of highly reactive oxygen species (ros) 2 (1, 2). the
ros cause oxidative stress, dna damage, lipid peroxidation, membrane damage, cytotoxicity, mutagenicity,
and carcinogenicity (1– 8). in contrast, quinone oxidoreductases catalyze two-electron reduction of quinones (9 –11). the two-electron reduction of quinones
does not result in the formation of free radicals
(semiquinones) and ros, thus protecting the cells
against adverse effects of quinones and their derivatives. however, a few hydroquinones undergo autoxidation to generate ros that leads to cellular toxicity
(12).
the two cytosolic forms of quinone oxidoreductases
[ xxxg1592xxx  ( xxxg1592xxx ) and
 xxxg1593xxx  ( xxxg1593xxx )] have been
identified, characterized, and cloned from mouse and
human tissues (11). as a protective agent,  xxxg1592xxx  activity has been shown to prevent the formation of
highly reactive quinone metabolites (13), detoxify
benzo[a]pyrene quinone (14), and reduce chromi2

quinones are widely distributed in nature and human exposure to them is extensive. quinones of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons are abundant in all burnt

um(vi) toxicity (15). in addition, it is known that many
compounds that block the toxic, mutagenic, and neoplastic effects of carcinogens share in common the ability to elevate levels of detoxifying enzymes, including
 xxxg1592xxx ,  xxxg1073xxx , and udp-glucuronosyltransferases (10, 16 –18). the induction of  xxxg1592xxx  is
an important factor in prevention of quinone and its
precursor-related cytotoxicity (10, 11). zhang et al. (19)
followed induction of the  xxxg1592xxx  activity in mouse hepatoma (hepa-1) cells and isolated a compound “sulforaphane” from saga broccoli. the sulforaphane has been
shown to block the formation of mammary tumors in
sprague–dawley rats treated with a single dose of
9,10-dimethyl-1,2-benzanthracene (20). this activity of
sulforaphane has been attributed to its ability to induce detoxifying enzymes. therefore, it has been
clearly established that  xxxg1592xxx  plays an important role
in chemoprevention by protecting the cells from quinones and related compounds. recent studies have
revealed that  xxxg1593xxx  is different from  xxxg1592xxx  in cofactor
requirement (21, 22).  xxxg1593xxx  uses dihydronicotinamide
riboside (nrh) rather than nad(p)h as an electron
donor. the role of  xxxg1593xxx  in detoxification of quinones
remains unknown.
the nqo activities have also been reported in microsomal, mitochondrial, and golgi fractions (23, 24).
however, these activities have not been characterized,
purified, or cloned. there is no information available
on the number of isoenzymes present, their substrate
specificities, expression, regulation, and role in metabolic detoxification of quinones.
in this report, we have characterized and partially
purified the rat liver microsomal nqo (mnqo) activity. the mnqo activity showed significantly higher
affinity for nadh than nadph as electron donors and
catalyzed reduction of 2,6-dichlorophenolindophenol
and  xxxd2563xxx . the mnqo activity was insensitive to
 xxxd1875xxx , a potent inhibitor of cytosolic  xxxg1592xxx . western analysis of microsomal proteins with antibodies
against rat liver cytosolic  xxxg1592xxx  revealed the presence
of 29- and 18-kda bands that cross-reacted with antibodies. the mnqo activity was partially purified by
solubilization of microsomes with detergent chaps,
ammonium sulfate fractionation, and deae-sephacel
column chromatography. the microsomal mnqo proteins are expected to provide additional protection after cytosolic nqos against quinone toxicity and mutagenicity.
materials and methods
homogenization, subcellular fractionation, and preparation of microsomes. fisher rat livers were homogenized in 50 mm tris, ph
7.4, containing 0.25 m sucrose and protease inhibitors (100 ␮m
pmsf, 125 ␮g of antipain and 125 ␮g of leupeptin per 100 ml of
homogenization buffer) and fractionated into nuclear, mitochondrial,
microsomal, and cytosolic fractions by standard procedures (25).

63

pmsf, antipain, and leupeptin were purchased from sigma chemical co., st. louis, mo. microsomal fractions were washed three
times with homogenization buffer. cross contamination of one subcellular fraction to the other was checked by marker enzyme assays
in all the fractions. the marker enzymes were succinate dehydrogenase for mitochondrial, acid phosphatase for lysosomal, nadph:
cytochrome p450 reductase for microsomal, and lactate dehydrogenase for cytosolic fractions. the microsomal fraction which was
washed three times with isotonic sucrose solution containing similar
protease inhibitors as described above did not contain any succinate
dehydrogenase, acid phosphatase, and lactate dehydrogenase activities and was free of mitochondrial, lysosomal, and cytosolic contamination (data not shown).
solubilization of microsomes. the rat liver microsomes were solubilized in solubilization buffer (100 mm tris–hcl, ph 7.5, 0.25 m
sucrose, 20% glycerol and 1.95% chaps) by incubation with stirring
at 4°c for 1 h. after the incubation, the mixture was centrifuged at
105,000g for 1 h to remove insolubilized microsomes.
 xxxg1592xxx  assay. the nqo activity was determined by previously
described procedures (26). the final reaction mixture contained 25
mm tris/hcl, ph 7.4, 0.18 mg/ml bovine  xxxg124xxx , 5 ␮m fad,
0.01% tween 20, 200 ␮m nadh, 50 ␮m 2,6-dichlorophenolindophenol (dcpip), and 2.0 –5.0 ␮g of protein. the reaction rate was monitored by measuring the decrease in absorbance due to reduction of
dcpip at 600 nm. the solubilized microsomes were pretreated with
several inhibitors [ xxxd1875xxx  (9 –11), lapacol (27), and  xxxd2843xxx  (28)] of cytosolic  xxxg1592xxx  activity for 5 min at room
temperature prior to the measurement of nqo activity to identify
the inhibitors of microsomal nqos.
two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and western
analysis. the chaps-solubilized microsomes were separated on
two-dimensional gel electrophoresis using ampholine (ph 3–10) in
the first dimension and regular sds-page in the second dimension
by procedures as described (29). the proteins after separation were
transferred to the membrane and probed with antibody against rat
liver cytosolic  xxxg1592xxx  by previously described procedures (26). polyclonal  xxxg1592xxx  antibody used in the present study was raised in
rabbits against purified rat cytosolic  xxxg1592xxx  protein (ref. (26)). this
antibody has been demonstrated to cross-react with rat, mice, and
human  xxxg1592xxx  proteins (26, 30).
partial purification of microsomal nqos. the chaps-solubilized
rat liver microsomes were fractionated with 0 3 30, 30 3 65, and
65 3 90% ammonium sulfate. the solid ammonium sulfate was
slowly added to the solubilized microsomes with stirring under cold
conditions to achieve 30% concentration. the mixture was centrifuged under cold conditions at 25,000 rpm for 30 min. the pellet and
supernatant were separated, and the pellet was homogenized in 5 ml
of homogenization buffer (50 mm tris, ph 7.4). the supernatant was
used for 30 3 65% ammonium sulfate fractionation. the 30 3 65%
ammonium sulfate precipitate was separated by centrifugation at
25,000 rpm for 30 min. the 30 3 65% ammonium sulfate pellet was
homogenized in 5 ml of homogenization buffer. the 30 3 65% supernatant was used to precipitate proteins between 65 3 90% ammonium sulfate. the pellet obtained with 65 3 90% ammonium
sulfate was also homogenized in 5 ml of homogenization buffer. all
fractions (0 3 30% pellet, 30 3 65% pellet, 65 3 90% pellet, and
supernatant of 65 3 90% ammonium sulfate) were dialyzed against
homogenization buffer with three changes and analyzed for nqo
activity and protein content. sixty percent of the microsomal nqo
activity was precipitated between 30 3 65% ammonium sulfate. a
deae-sephacel column (1.5 cm wide and 10 cm high) was equilibrated with 50 mm tris–hcl, ph 7.4, and loaded with the 30 3 65%
fraction containing mnqo activity. the deae-sephacel column was
run under gravity. the proteins bound to the deae-sephacel column were eluted with (i) 25 ml of 50 mm tris–hcl, ph 7.4; (ii) 25 ml
of 50 mm tris–hcl, ph 7.4, containing 100 mm kcl; (iii) 25 ml of 50

characterization of microsomal nad(p)h:quinone
oxidoreductases (mnqos)
the rat liver microsomal and cytosolic nqo activities are shown in table i. microsomal nqo activity,
like cytosolic activity, catalyzed reduction of 2,6-dichlorophenolindophenol and  xxxd2563xxx . the specific activity of microsomal nqo was 4- to 5-fold higher than
that of the cytosolic nqo (table i). however, the total
nqo activity was 15- to 20-fold higher in the cytosolic
than microsomal fraction (data not shown). a major
difference between cytosolic and microsomal mnqo
activities was observed in their affinity toward nadh
and nadph. the cytosolic nqo utilized both nadh
and nadph with equal affinity, whereas the microsomal activity was three to four times more active with
nadh compared to nadph (table i).
the cytosolic nqo activity was strongly inhibited by

low concentrations of  xxxd1875xxx  (table ii). in contrast, the microsomal mnqo activity was not inhibited
with lower or higher concentrations of  xxxd1875xxx  (table ii). in addition, a second inhibitor of cytosolic nqo
activity, lapacol, also did not inhibit the microsomal
mnqo activity (table ii).  xxxd2843xxx ,
an inhibitor of nadh: xxxg1456xxx  5 reductase, did not
inhibit cytosolic and microsomal nqo activities.
the microsomal activity was inhibited by antibodies
(antiserum) against cytosolic  xxxg1592xxx  protein (table iii).
interestingly, the inhibition kinetics of cytosolic and
microsomal mnqo activities by antiserum against cytosolic  xxxg1592xxx  protein were different. twenty-five microliters of  xxxg1592xxx  antiserum could inhibit only 32% of
the microsomal nqo activity compared to 68% of the
cytosolic nqo activity. increasing the concentration of
 xxxg1592xxx  antiserum in the assay mixture to 100 ␮l did not
cause any significant increase in the inhibition of microsomal nqo activity. the maximum amount of inhibition in microsomal nqo activity with  xxxg1592xxx  antiserum did not exceed more than 35% compared to 85%
inhibition observed in cytosolic nqo activity. sds–

the mnqo activity was partially purified by subcellular fractionation, ammonium sulfate fractionation,
and deae-sephacel chromatography. the results are
shown in table iv. the ammonium sulfate fractionation of chaps-solubilized microsomes produced sixfold purification and 60% yield in the 40 – 65% fraction.
the mnqos were eluted in three peaks from the
deae-sephacel column by kcl gradient. peak 1,
eluted with 0 mm kcl, demonstrated maximum purification (39-fold) of mnqo. peak 2, eluted with 100
mm kcl, showed 17-fold purification and peak 3,
eluted with 250 mm kcl, showed 22-fold purification.
western analysis of proteins from the three peaks with
antibody against cytosolic  xxxg1592xxx  indicated the presence of the 29-kda band in all the peaks (fig. 2).
however, the 18-kda band was only visible in peak 1.
discussion

chemical carcinogenesis is a complex and multistage
process. until recently, reduction or avoidance of exposure to chemical carcinogens and early diagnosis were
the only hopes of reducing the incidence of cancer or
achieving better therapeutic results. it is now known
that many opportunities exist to block or even reverse
the neoplastic process between the exposure to carcinogens and ultimate development of malignancy (1,
9 –11). one opportunity is to increase the detoxification
mechanisms within the cells (10, 11). the role of detoxification enzymes in the etiology and prevention of

cancer continues to be supported by results from clinical investigations and animal models (11). nad(p)h:
quinone oxidoreductases (nqos) are a group of detoxifying enzymes that prevent the generation of semiquinones and ros and protect cells against oxidative
stress, toxicity, mutagenicity, and, most likely, carcinogenicity. among various nqos, cytosolic  xxxg1592xxx  is
the best studied enzyme followed by cytosolic  xxxg1593xxx 
(9 –11, 21, 22).
we have characterized the nqo activity from rat
liver microsomal fraction. this activity could not have
been due to contamination of the microsomes with
cytosolic nqo ( xxxg1592xxx  and  xxxg1593xxx ) because the microsomes were free of cytosolic contamination as no lactate dehydrogenase activity (a marker for cytosolic
fraction) was detected in the microsomes. furthermore, cytosolic nqo activity has equal affinity for
nadh and nadph and is strongly inhibited by  xxxd1875xxx  compared to the microsomal activity, which prefers nadh over nadph and is not inhibited by  xxxd1875xxx . in addition, the microsomal activity is different
from nadh: xxxg1456xxx  5 reductase activity of microsomes as the activity was not inhibited by  xxxd2843xxx , an inhibitor of  xxxg1456xxx  5 reductase
activity (28). the microsomal nqo activity is also different from nadph:cytochrome p450 reductase because it utilizes nadh as cofactor. the nadph:cytochrome p450 reductase does not utilize nadh as cofactor (31). all these data suggest that the microsomal
fraction contains unique nqo activity. this activity
has been designated as microsomal nqo (mnqo). the
mnqo activity in the microsomes is immunologically
related to the cytosolic  xxxg1592xxx  for two reasons. first,
the microsomal activity is inhibited by antibodies (antiserum) against cytosolic  xxxg1592xxx  protein. second, two
microsomal proteins with molecular masses 29 and 18
kda cross-reacted with the antibodies against cytosolic
 xxxg1592xxx  as revealed by western analysis.
we partially purified the mnqo enzymes from the
microsomes first by treating the microsomes with the
detergent chaps followed by ammonium sulfate fractionation and deae-sephacel chromatography. the 29-kda
band was found distributed in three peaks eluted with 0,
100, and 250 mm kcl from the deae-sephacel column.
the 29-kda microsomal mnqo protein also separated in
three forms on an isoelectric focusing gel between ph 7
and 8. therefore, it is possible that the three bands seen

in the isoelectric focusing gel correspond to the three
deae-sephacel peaks. the three 29-kda bands may
have arisen because of posttranslational modifications
such as phosphorylation or may represent different
isoenzymatic proteins. the 18-kda band was detected as
a single band with pi 4.5–5.5. the absence of the 18-kda
band in deae-sephacel peaks 2 and 3 indicated that
nqo activity in these peaks is associated with the 29kda protein, the only other band that cross-reacted with
antibodies against cytosolic  xxxg1592xxx . these results also
indicated that the 29- and 18-kda bands may not be
related and that their nqo activities are independent of
one other. it is also possible that the 18-kda band is a
degraded product of the 29-kda mnqo protein. however, a conclusive result will be known only after complete purification of these proteins.
the role of mnqos in quinone detoxification is expected but remains unknown. the mnqos are expected to provide additional protection to microsomal
membranes and dna after cytosolic enzymes. they
may serve as backup enzymes in case of loss of cytosolic
enzymes and/or they may detoxify chemicals that are
poorly detoxified by cytosolic nqos. another reasonable hypothesis is that microsomal mnqos may provide local protection to the microsomal membranes
from damage due to semiquinones and ros generated
by p450 reductase, b 5 reductase, and other one-electron-reducing enzymes that have microsomal membrane localization. this protection will, of course, be in
addition to the cytosolic enzymes. the major constituents of biological membranes are lipid and protein, the
ratios of which change depending on the function of the
membranes. the membranes are vital for cell survival
and damage to membrane lipids or proteins by lipid
peroxidation could lead to cytotoxicity and cell death.
therefore, the presence of microsomal mnqos in
membranes is highly significant. the purification and
cloning of microsomal nqos should lead to a better
understanding of the role of these enzymes in quinone
detoxification and protection against electrophilic and
oxidative stress.
