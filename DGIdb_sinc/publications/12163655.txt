abstract the cystathionine ␤-synthase knockout
mouse provides a unique opportunity to study biochemical
consequences of a defective cystathionine ␤-synthase enzyme. the present study was undertaken to assess the
effect of elevated plasma total homocysteine caused by
cystathionine ␤-synthase deficiency on one-carbon metabolism in 10 homozygous mutant mice and 10 age- and
sex-matched wild-type mice. plasma total homocysteine
levels,  xxxd3156xxx  and s- xxxd3157xxx  concentrations in liver, kidney and brain were measured by hplc. tissue dna methylation status was measured by in vitro dna methyl acceptance. plasma total
homocysteine concentration in food-deprived homozygous
mutant mice (271.1 ⴞ 61.5 ␮mol/l) was markedly higher
than in wild-type mice (7.4 ⴞ 2.9 ␮mol/l) (p < 0.001). in liver
only,  xxxd3156xxx  concentrations were higher in
the homozygous mutant mice (35.6 ⴞ 5.9 nmol/g) than in
wild type mice (19.1 ⴞ 6.1 nmol/g) (p < 0.001) and tended to
be lower in kidney (p ⴝ 0.07). in contrast, s- xxxd3157xxx  concentrations were significantly higher in homozygous mutant mice compared with wild-type mice in all
tissues studied. genomic dna methylation status in homozygous mutant compared with wild-type mice was lower
in liver (p ⴝ 0.037) and tended to be lower in kidney (p
ⴝ 0.077) but did not differ in brain (p ⴝ 0.46). the results of
this study are consistent with the predicted role of cystathionine ␤-synthase in the regulation of plasma total homocysteine levels and tissue s- xxxd3157xxx  levels.
however, the fact that the absence of the enzyme had
differential effects on  xxxd3156xxx  concentra-

homocysteine is a nonprotein-forming, sulfur-containing
amino acid, which occupies a branch point between two
metabolic pathways, remethylation and transsulfuration (1).
in remethylation, homocysteine acquires a methyl group from
n-5-methyltetrahydrofolate or from betaine to form methionine. the reaction with n-5-methyltetrahydrofolate occurs in
all tissues and is  xxxd2716xxx -12 dependent, whereas the reaction
with betaine is confined mainly to the liver and is vitamin
b-12 independent. in the transsulfuration pathway, homocysteine condenses with serine to form cystathionine in an irreversible reaction catalyzed by the pyridoxal-5⬘-phosphate
(plp)5-containing enzyme, cystathionine-␤-synthase (cbs).
cystathionine is then hydrolyzed by a second plp-containing
enzyme, ␥-cystathionase, to form cysteine and ␣-ketobutyrate
(2). a decreased rate of metabolism through either of these
pathways can lead to homocysteinemia and homocystinuria.
carson and neill (3) first described homocysteinuria in
mentally retarded individuals and mudd et al. (4) subsequently
reported that the primary defect in homocysteinuria was a
defect in the cbs enzyme. cbs deficiency is the most common inborn error of sulfur amino acid metabolism. patients
with this enzyme deficiency are characterized biochemically by
severe hyperhomocysteinemia and homocysteinuria, and clinically by premature arteriosclerosis and thromboembolism (5).
in 1995, watanabe et al. (6) reported the generation of a
knockout mouse that was deficient in cbs. the rationale
behind the creation of this mutant was the growing evidence
that elevated concentrations of total homocysteine (thcy), in
blood are associated with an increased risk of vascular disease.
the homozygous mutant mice did not exhibit histological
signs of atherosclerosis, in spite of the fact that their homocysteine levels were significantly greater than those of the
wild-type and heterozygous strains (6). however, it was shown

materials and methods
animals. this study was approved by the institutional animal
care and use committee of the jean mayer usda human nutrition research center on aging at tufts university. cbs-deficient
mice were obtained from the university of north carolina at chapel
hill, where these mice were developed. all mice were maintained in
commercially available caging and bedding and consumed an ad
libitum standard (or autoclaved) food (teklad 7012, madison, wi)
and water. the tip end of the tail was clipped from each mouse and
dna was extracted to determine the genotype. for mice ⬍ 14 d old,
the tail was clipped without anesthesia and an ear punch was performed for animal identification purposes. no tail clips were done on
14- to 21-d-old mice. for mice that were ⬎ 21 d old, the tail clip was
done under anesthesia; at the same time, the ear was punched for
identification purposes. to maintain the colony, there were four
breeding generations per year with 2 males and 4 females bred per
generation (24 mice/y).
ten homozygous mutant and 10 age- and sex-matched wild-type
mice were used in this study. the mice were between 3 and 9 mo old
and the male to female gender ratio was 4 to 6. after the mice were
anesthetized with carbon dioxide, blood was drawn by cardiac puncture, they were killed by exsanguination, and liver, kidney and brain
were harvested.
cbs genotype determination. dna was extracted from the tail
clip using a commercially available dna extraction kit (invitrogeneasy dna kit, san diego, ca). polymerase chain reaction (pcr)
was carried out using the primers 5⬘-gaagtggagctatcagagca-3⬘; 5⬘-tggctcttggttctgaaacc-3⬘ and 5⬘gaggtcgacggtatcgata-3⬘ to generate a 450-bp fragment
in the homozygous mutant and an 800-bp fragment in the wild-type
mice (6). the pcr products were electrophoresed on a 1.5% agarose
gel and visualized by ethidium bromide staining.
measurement of homocysteine. total plasma homocysteine was
determined by hplc using fluorometric detection as described by
araki and sako (12).
measurement of sam and sah. sam and sah concentrations were measured by hplc with uv detection using the method
described by fell et al. (13) with modification (14).
dna methylation assay. the methylation status of cpg sites in
genomic dna was determined by the in vitro methyl acceptance
capacity of dna using [3h-methyl]sam as a methyl donor and a
prokaryotic cpg dna methyltransferase, as previously described
(15). briefly, 2 ␮g of dna was incubated for 2 h at 37°c with 185
kbq of [3h-methyl]sam (new england nuclear, boston, ma), 4 u
of  xxxg2028xxx  methylase (new england biolabs, beverly, ma), 1x  xxxg2028xxx 
buffer (50 mmol/l nacl, 10 mmol/l tris-hcl, 10 mmol/l edta, 1
mmol/l dithiothreitol, ph 8.0) in a total volume of 50 ␮l methylation mixture.  xxxg2028xxx  methylase was denatured by heating at 65°c for
20 min. the incubation mixture was applied onto the discs of
whatman de-81 ion exchange filters (fisher scientific, springfield,
nj) using a vacuum filtration apparatus; the discs were then washed
with 0.35 mol/l na2hpo4 for 45 min. the discs were dried at 95°c
for 30 min, and the resulting radioactivity of the dna retained in the
discs was measured by scintillation counting using a nonaqueous
scintillation fluid. all analyses were done in triplicate and the three
values were averaged.

statistical analysis. to determine the effect of cbs deficiency
on different aspects of one-carbon metabolism, we compared plasma
thcy, sam, sah, the sam/sah ratio and the methylation status of
homozygous mutant mice with those of wild-type mice using paired t
tests. for some of the variables, a log transformation was applied
before analysis when it improved the normality of the differences
between the two groups. these variables are identified with an
asterisk in tables 1 and 2. values in the text are means ⫾ sd.

results
plasma thcy concentrations. the plasma thcy level of
food-deprived homozygous mutant mice (271.1 ⫾ 61.5
␮mol/l) was greater than that of wild-type mice (7.4 ⫾ 2.9
␮mol/l) (p ⬍ 0.001).
sam and sah concentrations and the sam/sah ratio in
different tissues. sam levels in homozygous mutant mice
were greater in liver (p ⬍ 0.001) and tended to be greater in
kidney (p ⫽ 0.07), but did not differ from wild-type mice in
brain (p ⫽ 0.30) (table 1). in contrast, sah levels in homozygous mutant mice were higher in all three tissues compared with those of wild-type mice: 8 times higher in liver (p
⬍ 0.001), 8 times higher in kidney (p ⬍ 0.001) and 190 times
higher in brain (p ⬍ 0.001). the sam/sah ratio in homozygous mutant mice was significantly lower in all three tissues
compared with that of wild-type mice: 80% lower in liver (p
⬍ 0.001), 87% lower in kidney (p ⬍ 0.001) and essentially
100% lower in brain (p ⬍ 0.001).
dna methylation status in different tissues. the dna
methyl acceptance capacity in homozygous mutant mice was
higher in liver dna (p ⫽ 0.037), tended to be higher in
kidney dna (p ⫽ 0.077) and did not differ in brain (p
⫽ 0.46) compared with mean dna methyl acceptance capacity in wild-type mice (table 2).
discussion
it has been known that cbs deficiency increases the levels
of plasma thcy since the first observation that the primary
defect in homocysteinuria in humans was an enzymatic defect
of cbs (4). to investigate the effect of severe hyperhomocysteinemia, we chose homozygous mutant mice instead of heterozygous mice, which have a mild elevation of plasma thcy

recently that heterozygous mice, which have slightly increased
concentrations of plasma thcy, have impaired endothelial
function (7,8). although this animal model does not show the
expected arteriosclerosis, it provides a unique opportunity to
study the effect of elevated thcy on one-carbon metabolism.

(sah), and the sam/sah ratio have been used to evaluate
the “integrity” or “capacity” of biological methylation (9 –11),
including dna methylation. in the present study, we evaluated the effect of elevated plasma thcy induced by cbs
deficiency on one-carbon metabolism by comparing sam and
sah concentrations as well as dna methylation status in
different tissues of homozygous mutant and wild-type mice.

concentration (6,16). in the present study, homozygous mutant mice lacking the cbs enzyme had a 35-fold higher plasma
thcy concentration than wild-type mice. these results agree
with previous studies (6), and suggest that this mouse model is
a good model for severe hyperhomocysteinemia resulting from
cbs deficiency.
in vertebrate genomes, ⬃4% of cytosine residues are modified postsynthetically to 5-methylcytosine. the cell strictly
maintains its particular patterns of methylated residues, and
dna methylation is thought to play a role in the regulation of
gene expression and gene integrity (17). there is considerable
evidence suggesting that aberrant dna methylation plays an
integral role in oncogenesis. sam, a universal methyl donor,
reflects dna methylation status because low levels of sam
impair many methylation reactions (18,19). homocysteine,
sah and the sam/sah ratio have also been considered to be
indicators of dna methylation status (9,10). however, results
have been inconsistent in many animal studies. in rodent
models of hepatocarcinogenesis, diets deficient in sources of
methyl group donors (choline, folate, methionine and vitamin
b-12) decreased hepatic sam levels and subsequently induced
hepatic dna hypomethylation (19,20). however, in the
sprague-dawley rat model of moderate folate deficiency, decreased sam and increased sah levels were observed in the
liver, but dna methylation status in this organ was not
different from controls (21). in that animal model, sam and
sah levels, as well as dna methylation status in colon, did
not differ between folate-deficient rats and controls. most
recently, a homozygote mutant mouse model for the enzyme
 xxxg1475xxx  had significantly higher
plasma homocysteine and liver sah levels, but did not differ
from wild-type mice in liver genomic dna methylation (22).
in the present study, the livers of homozygous mutant mice,
which had higher sam levels compared with wild-type mice
had paradoxically lower dna methylation status. the kidneys
of homozygous mutant mice tended to have higher sam levels
and lower dna methylation status compared with wild-type
mice. in brain, there were no differences in sam levels or
dna methylation status between homozygous mutant and
wild-type mice. these data suggest that the response in sam
levels and dna methylation status to elevated plasma thcy is
specific to each tissue and that high sam levels do not
necessarily increase dna methylation.
homozygous mutant mice had higher sah concentrations
than wild-type mice in all tissues studied, suggesting that
increased plasma homocysteine does increase tissue sah levels. however, homozygous mutant mice had significantly lower
dna methylation status than wild-type mice only in the liver.

dna methylation status in homozygous mutant mice tended
to be lower in kidney and did not differ in brain compared with
wild-type mice. this observation, which is similar to previous
report (16), suggests that the inhibitory effect of sah on
dna methylation also has tissue specificity.
the sam/sah ratio has also been considered to be a
sensitive indicator of dna methylation (11). in this study,
homozygous mutant liver, which had lower sam/sah ratio
than wild-type liver, had significantly lower dna methylation
status. however, homozygous mutant kidney, which had lower
sam/sah ratio than wild-type kidney, tended to have lower
methylation status. homozygous mutant brain, which had
essentially 100% lower sam/sah ratio than wild-type brain,
did not show any significant differences in dna methylation
status. this observation suggests that the effect of sam/sah
ratio on dna methylation status was also tissue specific.
marked tissue-specific differences in genomic dna methylation have been reported in vivo (23), and some studies
suggest that hypomethylation may, in fact, be a feature of
proliferating cells (24,25). during dna replication, the newly
synthesized strand is not methylated. after cell replication, the
normal pattern of dna methylation is catalyzed by a samrequiring maintenance methylase that is specific for hemimethylated sites. the maintenance methylase recognizes the
5-methylcytosine at the cpg site on the parental strand as a
signal to methylate the corresponding cpg site on the daughter strand (25). rapidly proliferating cells, which have a relatively high proportion of hemimethylated sites in their dna,
have relatively low total genomic dna methylation, whereas
differentiated cells have relatively stable methylation patterns
(26). the liver of homozygous mutant mice had decreased
dna methylation status with increased sam and decreased
sah concentrations, suggesting that sah affects dna methylation more effectively than sam in the liver, a relatively
more proliferative organ than the brain. however, the dna
methylation status of brain, a relatively less proliferating organ
than liver, was not altered by the increased sah concentration and normal sam concentration because the cpg sites
were already methylated. the methyl acceptance capacity of
brain dna was quite low compared with liver (table 2).
kidney, which is also a relatively more proliferating organ
than brain, tended to have lower than normal dna methylation status, suggesting that the increased sah concentration
had more effects on dna methylation than did the sam
concentration, which tended to be higher than controls. our
results suggest that normal or elevated sam concentrations do
not affect dna methylation status, whereas the effect of
elevated sah concentrations on dna methylation is tissue
specific and may depend on the proliferation status of each
tissue.
in conclusion, hyperhomocysteinemia induced by severe
cbs deficiency increases sah levels in liver, kidney and
brain, but responses of sam levels and dna methylation
status differed among tissues. plasma thcy and tissue sam,
sah and the sam/sah ratio are not the sole determinants
of tissue dna methylation.
