corticosteroid design for the treatment of asthma: structural insights
and the therapeutic potential of soft corticosteroids
nicholas bodor* and peter buchwald
ivax research, inc., miami, florida, usa
abstract: inhaled and intranasal corticosteroids (icss) still are the most effective treatment available for allergic airway
diseases and are likely to remain the cornerstone of managing persistent asthma/allergic rhinitis in the foreseeable future.
even if the therapeutic index of this class increased significantly with the introduction of newer corticosteroids, and even
if new therapeutic potentials are beginning to emerge with our increasing understanding of the mechanisms of asthma,
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and rhinitis, corticosteroid development still remains a very important field for
drug designers. after a brief review of issues related to the structure-activity relationships of glucocorticoids and the main
determinants of their receptor-binding affinity at the  xxxg1601xxx , the main focus of the present article will be
on the development of soft corticosteroids, as they are particularly well suited to separate local activity from systemic side
effects, which still is an important issue for icss. design consideration required in the search for safe and effective soft
drugs on one hand, and safe and effective icss on the other hand, will be briefly discussed and illustrated with a number
of cases, in particular, with that of  xxxd2509xxx  etabonate and etiprednol dicloacetate, soft corticosteroids that are being developed for a full spectrum of therapeutic applications including asthma and allergic rhinitis.

introduction
asthma is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the airways
associated with airway hyperresponsiveness, airflow limitation, and respiratory symptoms [1, 2]. asthma and rhinitis,
together with a number of other allergic diseases, are reaching epidemic proportions, especially within industrialized
countries [3]. in many of these countries, almost half of the
population demonstrates sensitization to one or more environmental allergens, and in some of them, already 25% of
children under 14-year-olds have asthma and 20% have eczema [2, 3]. despite a lack of definitive proof, it is becoming
increasingly clear that these rising trends are due both to
increased exposure to sensitizing allergens and to reduced
stimulation of the immune system during critical periods of
development (the so-called hygiene hypothesis) [3-5]. even
if most of these allergic diseases are not life threatening
(which nevertheless they can be), they cause considerable
discomfort for those who are affected and a considerable
total cost of treatment for the society.
glucocorticoids
corticosteroids exert profound biologic effects in almost
every organ, and they are one of the most widely used drug
classes [6, 7]. ever since the addition of cortisone (1948) and
hydrocortisone (1951) to the therapeutic arsenal, an event
usually considered as one of the ten definitive moments of
modern medicine [8], glucocorticoids have been in use as
potent anti-inflammatory agents. today, not only are they
commonly utilized in a bewildering range of clinical diseases
– mainly for their anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive

effects (table 1), but they also are the mainstay of therapy
and the drug of choice in many of these diseases.
currently, inhaled/intranasal corticosteroids (icss) still
are the most effective treatment available for allergic airway
diseases [9]. of all single medications, inhaled corticosteroids are the most effective controllers for persistent asthma,
i.e., maintenance medications taken daily on a long-term
basis that are useful in getting and keeping persistent asthma
under control [2, 9, 10]. similarly, intranasal corticosteroids
are the most effective treatment for allergic rhinitis [11].
with the introduction of newer corticosteroids, the therapeutic index of this class increased significantly: whereas local
activity and clinical efficacy were preserved or enhanced,
most of the serious and immediately apparent side effects of
early steroid therapies, such as fluid retention, hyperglycemias, weight gain, and osteoporosis were virtually eliminated [12]. as a result, after their introduction in the 1970s,
the use of icss increased dramatically (e.g., it increased
about 14-fold in sweden between 1978 and 1991), and this
was correlated with a decrease in the number of hospital beddays in acute somatic care due to asthma [13]. however,
significant portions of the topically applied drugs (e.g., lung,
nasal mucosa, gastrointestinal tract, or skin) reach the general circulatory system (fig. 1). for inhaled corticosteroids,
about 60–90% of the administered dose is swallowed, absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract, and can reach the systemic circulation (depending on the oral bioavailability of
the corresponding ics) [9, 14]. the actual fraction of the
dose that reaches the lung depends on the inhalation device
used. the particle size of the inhaled powder or droplet or
aerosol is a key factor influencing dosing efficiency and distribution to various regions. for corticosteroids, the alveoli
are the preferred site for activity as they seem to have the
highest concentration of glucocorticoid receptors, and only
particles having a mass median aerodynamic diameter

(mmad) of 1–5 µm reach the alveolar space [15]. the
10–40% fraction deposited to the lung sooner or later will
also be absorbed in its entirety into the systemic circulation
as there seems to be no evidence for metabolic inactivation
of currently available icss along this pathway [9]. consequently, resulting systemic side effects (table 2) [16-18]
together with local side effects, such as oral candidiasis or
dysphonia, still limit the application of icss. it is also important to remember that whereas the dose-response curves
are relatively flat for icss as they tend to be highly efficacious even at low doses, the dose-response curves for their
side effects tend to be steep (an observation that was especially evident for  xxxd2145xxx , fp) [19]. icss still
are often underused because of concerns about side effects
[20], and in a few cases, even severe systemic side-effects
have been seen especially when co-administered with
cyp3a4 inhibitors [18, 21-24]. therefore, even if with an
increasing understanding of the mechanisms of asthma [25],
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [26], and rhinitis [5],
new therapeutic potentials are beginning to emerge, corticosteroid development still remains a very important field
for drug designers since icss are likely to remain the corner-

stone of managing persistent asthma/allergic rhinitis in the
foreseeable future.
structure–activity relationships
naturally occurring corticosteroids are synthesized by the
adrenal cortex together with androgens. historically, their
actions were described as glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid being related to the regulation of carbohydrate metabolism and electrolyte balance, respectively. a number of
structural requirements for glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid activities are now commonly accepted on the basis of
activity data accumulated for a variety of natural and synthetic corticosteroids (see fig. 2), which also includes the
numbering and notation system of these structures) [6]. in
ring a, the 3-keto group and the 4,5-double bond (∆4,5) seem
essential for both gluco- and mineralocorticoid activities,
whereas an additional 1,2-double bond (∆1,2) seems to selectively increase glucocorticoid activity. in ring b, halogenation (most commonly fluorination and sometimes chlorination) at the 6alpha and 9alpha position enhances both glucocorticoid
and mineralocorticoid activity. in ring c, an 11beta hydroxyl
substitution seems required for glucocorticoid, but not for

is subsequently swallowed and absorbed from the gastrointestinal (gi) tract. this (orally bioavailable) fraction together with the drug absorbed from the lung can cause undesired systemic side effects.

mineralocorticoid activity. in ring d, there seems to be some
freedom in choosing substitutions at c16 and c17. substitutions at c16 tend to eliminate mineralocorticoid activity. by
all indications, a hydroxyl group at c21 seems required for
mineralocorticoid activity, but it is not an absolute requirement for glucocorticoid activity. many of these structural
requirements have been recently reinforced by solving the
structure of a  xxxg1601xxx  with a bound ligand as
it will be briefly discussed in the next subchapter. a detailed
review of the literature data on the effects of structural alterations in the steroid structures at all possible sites (c1 to
c21) has been published recently [7].
the  xxxg1601xxx 
despite the more than 50 years of glucocorticoid use, the
molecular mechanism of glucocorticoid action started to
emerge only recently [27, 28]. these steroids exert their action by binding to glucocorticoid receptors (grs). grs are
predominantly localized to the cytoplasm of target cells and
move into the nuclear compartment only on binding of the
glucocorticoid. the binding affinity of cortisol (hydrocorti-

sone) to the gr seems to be around 30 nm, which is within
the normal plasma concentration range of free cortisol [9].
glucocorticoid receptors are soluble, intracellular proteins that act as ligand-regulated transcription factors controlling specific gene expression in most mammalian cells
[29]. structural studies have been hampered by problems
related to the expression and purification of an active protein. mostly due to solubility problems, gr was more difficult to express than other members of the nuclear receptor
super-family. besides the glucocorticoid receptors, this steroid-thyroid-retinoid receptor super-family includes receptors
for steroids, such as receptors for mineralocorticoids, estrogens, progestins, and androgens, as well as receptors for thyroid hormone, vitamins a- an d-derived hormones, and certain  xxxd2154xxx  [30]. nevertheless, the crystal structure of the
human gr ligand binding domain (lbd) bound to dexamethasone (dex) has been recently determined by using a
receptor with a single point mutation (f602s) [31]. the  xxxg1601xxx  gr seems to have an additional branch
compared to the steroid-shaped pocket of androgen-, estrogen-, or progestin-receptors. hence, it can accommodate the

larger 17alpha substituents of glucocorticoids that are not present
in testosterone, estrogen, or progesterone. in the crystal
structure (fig. 3), dex seems to occupy only about 65% of
the volume of the gr steroid pocket, whose total volume
was estimated to be around 580 å3. nevertheless, nearly
every atom of the steroid core of dex is in contact with one
or more hydrophobic residue of gr, and there also are specific protein-ligand hydrogen bonds at all hydrophilic moieties (e.g., at the c3 ketone, at the 11beta-, 17alpha-, and 21hydroxyl) (fig. 3). these interactions are likely to provide
the binding specificity at gr and probably also are responsible for many of the sars indicated in fig. (2). for example,
steroids active at the  xxxg1602xxx , such as aldosterone or corticosterone, lack the 17alpha-hydroxyl group,
which is hydrogen-bonded to gln642 in the gr. at this position, the  xxxg1602xxx  has a hydrophobic residue (leu848) that cannot form hydrogen bonds [31].
receptor-binding affinity
in general, receptor-binding affinity (rba) is a major
determinant of therapeutic potential. it is particularly so for
corticosteroids because glucocorticoid receptors from different tissues and even from different species seem to be essentially the same. hence, relative rbas (rrbas, usually
expressed using dex as reference) and various in vitro and

corticosteroid design for the treatment of asthma

in vivo pharmacological properties tend to correlate closely
[32]. for example, rba has been shown to be related to the
clinical efficacy of inhaled glucocorticoids [33], to side effects such as cortisol suppression [34, 35], or to immunosuppressive potency [36]. for the same reason, a simple noninvasive model (skin blanching from vasoconstriction) can be
a good predictor of the in vivo potency for glucocorticoids; a
great advantage when designing new compounds as, in general, in vivo activity is notoriously difficult to predict from
models. indeed, even for icss, average recommended daily
doses from the dosage guidelines of the national asthma
education and prevention program expert panel report 2 [1]
are closely correlated with rrba; the only exception being
 xxxd294xxx  (bdp), which, however, is a
prodrug and has to be transformed into the active 17alphamonopropionate (bmp) form. if the logarithm of the inverse
of the dose (log 1/d) is represented as a function of the log
rrba values, as customary in quantitative structure-activity
relationship (qsar) studies, excellent correlations are obtained: r2 values are 0.981 and 0.921 for the low and medium
doses, respectively (fig. 4).
from a therapeutic perspective it is also promising that
long-term treatment with glucocorticoids seems to cause no
significant alterations in gr binding characteristics even, for
example, in subjects with severe asthma [37]. typically,
experimental gr binding affinities are obtained with rat cytosol preparations by determining the concentration necessary to inhibit by 50% the binding of a given concentration
of 3h-dex (ic50). depending on the assay, the binding affinity of dex itself is usually somewhere in the range of
2–12 nm [38-42].

current pharmaceutical design, 2006, vol. 12, no. 25 3245

we have recently shown that for (soft) corticosteroids
that satisfy the main binding criteria at the gr, 6alpha- or 9alphahalogenation (characterized by an indicator variable) and
lipophilicity (as characterized by log po/w) account for a large
portion of the variability in log rrba [43]. a qsar model
that accounted for close to 80% of the variability in the log
rrba data could be built using only these two descriptors.
log rrba was used in all correlations as required by free
energy (g) considerations since it corresponds to ∆∆g values as compared to dex, the standard reference used in calculating rrbas. according to the data, rba at the gr is
increased dramatically by 6alpha- or 9alpha-halogenation (and
probably also by introduction of cyclic 16,17-acetal moieties) and it tends to increase with increasing lipophilicity
(fig. 5). structures halogenated (mostly fluorinated) at the
6alpha- and/or 9alpha-position had, on average, an almost tenfold
increased rba compared to their unsubstituted parent. there
was no major difference between substitutions at the 6alpha- or
9alpha-position, and the second fluorination seemed to cause
some improvement, but far less than that caused by the first.
the activity-enhancing effect of halogenation has been long
known (see fig. 2). one of the earliest detailed thermodynamic analysis of gr-binding [38] mainly based on limited
data from hydrocortisone and prednisolone derivatives suggested an approximate three-fold increase for 9alpha-fluorination
(∆∆g = –rt ln (ksubs/kunsubs) = 2.4 kj/mol), two-fold increase for 6alpha-fluorination, and four-fold increase for 9alphachlorination. there also is a size-limitation as bromination
already decreases activity [38]. it still remains to be clarified
why does 6alpha- or 9alpha-halogenation increases glucocorticoidreceptor binding so significantly. the crystal structure of the
dex–gr complex does not seem to indicate the presence of

fig. (5). the logarithm of glucocorticoid rrba as a function of calculated log octanol-water partition coefficient (log po/w) for the structures,
mostly soft corticosteroids, included in the study of reference [43]. if 6alpha- or 9alpha-halogenated (and probably cyclic 16,17-acetal containing)
compounds are considered separately, lipophilicity alone accounts for a large portion of the variance in the log rrba data. the corresponding two separate trendlines are shown together with the corresponding regressions. data for compounds that do not satisfy known requirements for gr-binding were not used in the regression and are shown separately (open symbols). to allow graphical representation on a logarithmic scale, all rrba < 1 values were arbitrarily set to 0.3 for the inactive compounds not used in the correlations.

any special interaction. interestingly, 6alpha-halogenation (f,
cl) has no effect on binding of progesterone to its receptor
[44].
one has to remember that all compounds used in this
regression already satisfy the main structural requirements of
binding to the gr, and they already contain the essentials
pharmacophores required for adequate binding. because gr
seems to have a relatively large side pocket that can accommodate relatively large 17alpha-side chains, unspecific (van der
waals-type) interactions here could be responsible for a
good portion of the rrba variation seen, and they could
indeed be mainly size- and/or lipophilicity-dependent. therefore, as long as the substituents are not prohibitively large,
increasing size (and consequently increasing lipophilicity)
will result in increasing receptor binding (fig. 5). some of
the largest structures are probably already approaching the
size limitations of the steroid-binding pocket of gr, and
binding affinity seems to start declining for them. this is
especially evident in the halo-substituted group (see the
curved trendline for this group in fig. 5). it also has to be
noted that size limitations are much more stringent at the 17beta
side chain: larger substitutions here result in inactive compounds. most substituted 17beta esters such as bdp are inactive, but can be activated by hydrolytic cleavage of the ester
moiety.
corticosteroids exert their main action via binding to
these hormone receptors that regulate the expression of corticosteroid-responsive genes, but there is also increasing evidence that corticosteroids can exert non-genomic effects as
well [45]. unfortunately, because of their intrinsic multiple
activity and because of the ubiquitous distribution of the
corticosteroid receptors, unwanted side effects (table 2) tend

to closely parallel therapeutic effectiveness, which still represents a serious impediment. furthermore, corticosteroids
are also subject to different oxidative and/or reductive metabolic conversions. formation of various steroidal metabolites
can lead to undesirably complex situations. an illustrative
example is provided by hydrocortisone (cortisol) (1, fig. 6)
[46]. hence, there has been a continuous search for corticosteroids that undergo non-oxidative, extrahepatic metabolism to minimize the risk of systemic side effects. soft drug
approaches, to be reviewed in the next chapter, are particularly well suited for this purpose.
soft corticosteroids
soft drugs
soft drugs are new, active therapeutic agents, often isosteric-isoelectronic analogues of a lead compound, with a
chemical structure specifically designed to allow predictable
metabolism into inactive metabolites after exerting the desired therapeutic effect [47-49]. soft drugs are new therapeutic agents obtained by building into the molecule, in addition to the activity, an optimized deactivation and detoxification route. the concept was introduced in 1976 [50] and
reiterated on a number of occasions in 1980–1981 [51-54].
the desired activity is generally local, and the soft drug is
applied or administered at or near the site of action. therefore, in most cases, they produce pharmacological activity
locally, but their distribution away from the site results in a
prompt metabolic deactivation that prevents any kind of undesired pharmacological activity or toxicity (fig. 7).
the difference between soft drugs and prodrugs should
also be clarified because confusion related to these two terms

local effects are accompanied by no or just minimal systemic side effects.

is still frequent. prodrugs are pharmacologically inactive
compounds that result from transient chemical modifications
of biologically active species to improve some deficient
physicochemical property, such as membrane permeability
or water solubility, or to overcome some other problem, such
as rapid elimination, bad taste, or a formulation difficulty.
after administration, the prodrug, because of its improved
characteristics, will be more systemically and/or locally
available than the parent drug. however, before exerting its
biological effect, the prodrug must undergo chemical or biochemical conversion to the active form. therefore, in theoretical terms, the prodrug and the soft drug concepts are opposite to each other: whereas prodrugs are, ideally, inactive
by design and are converted by a predictable mechanism to
the active drug, soft drugs are active per se and are designed
to undergo a predictable and controllable metabolic deactivation.
with soft drugs, the goal is not to avoid metabolism, but
rather to control and direct it. inclusion of a metabolically
sensitive moiety into the drug molecule makes possible the
design and prediction of the major metabolic pathway and
avoids the formation of undesired toxic, active, or
high-energy intermediates. if possible, inactivation should
take place as the result of a single, low-energy and high capacity step that yields inactive species subject to rapid elimination. not surprisingly, most critical metabolic pathways
are mediated by oxygenases. as a. albert noticed: “an organism’s normal reaction to a foreign substance is to burn it
up as food” [55]. because oxygenases exhibit not only interspecies, but also interindividual variability and are subject to
inhibition and induction [56], and because the rates of hepatic monooxygenase reactions are at least two orders of
magnitude lower than the slowest of the other enzymatic
reactions [57], it is usually desirable to avoid oxidative
pathways as well as theses slow, easily saturable oxidases.
therefore, the design of soft drugs should be based on scaffolds inactivated by hydrolytic enzymes. rapid metabolism
can be more reliably carried out by these ubiquitously distributed esterases. not relying exclusively on metabolism or
clearance by organs such as liver or kidney is an additional
advantage because blood flow and enzyme activity in these
organs can be seriously impaired in critically ill patients.
enzymatic hydrolysis
carboxylic ester-containing chemicals are very efficiently hydrolyzed into the respective free acids by a class of
enzyme designated as carboxylic ester hydrolases (ec 3.1.1).
unfortunately, because these widely occurring enzymes exhibit broad and overlapping substrate specificity toward esters and amides, and because, in many cases, their exact
physiological role remains unclear, their classification is
difficult [58-64]. according to an older but still used classification system [65], the more important subclasses include
carboxylesterase,  xxxg430xxx  (carboxylic-ester hydrolase, aliesterase, b-esterase, monobutyrase, cocaine esterase, …);
arylesterase, ec 3.1.1.2 (a-esterase, paraoxonase); acetylcholinesterase,  xxxg38xxx  (choline esterase i); and cholinesterase,  xxxg248xxx  ( xxxg248xxx ,  xxxg248xxx ,
butyryl-choline esterase, benzoylcholinesterase, ...). a possible solution to the existing confusion might come from accumulation of adequate sequence information and emergence

bodor and buchwald

of a novel classification system based on this information
[64].
esterases belong to a superfamily of alpha/beta-fold proteins,
which contain a similar core of beta-sheets connected by alphahelices. esterases have widely varying sequence identities,
but share similarities in secondary and tertiary structure and
are related by divergent evolution [66, 67]. they also seem
to rely on a similar mechanism centered on a catalytic triad
of which the most common set is ser–his–glu (or asp) and
that seems to lie at the base of a deep catalytic gorge. experimental and modeling data seem to indicate that the active
site serine residue lies at the bottom of an approximately 25
å deep gorge that is negatively charged and relatively narrow (3–4 å diameter) [68, 69]. this can explain why negatively charged, e.g., carboxylic acid–substituted, compounds
are poor substrates, which is expected because carboxylic
acids are products of hydrolysis and should be repelled from
the active site. it might also explain why, in certain cases,
relatively small increases in size can completely limit access
to the active site and, hence, hydrolysis.
esterase activity not only depends on the substrate, but
also shows strong interspecies, interindividual, and interorgan variability [58, 64, 70, 71]. for example, the stability of
aliphatic esters frequently employed in soft drug (and prodrug) designs usually increases in the mouse < rat < rabbit <
dog < human order [72, 73], but there might be considerable
variability. therefore, compared to the usual problems related to the extrapolation of animal test results to man [74,
75], preclinical evaluation of ester-based soft drugs might be
even more challenging and animal data less predictive of
human clinical trial results. nevertheless, ester structures are
of sufficient chemical stability to provide the shelf life required for drugs. furthermore, we have recently succeeded
in developing a quantitative structure-metabolism relationship (qsmr) model that accounted for 80% of the variability in the log half-lives of 67 noncongener carboxylic esters
for in vitro human blood data and that should be useful in
estimating approximate rates of hydrolysis even ahead of
synthesis [76, 77].
soft corticosteroid designs
the design of soft anti-inflammatory corticosteroids has
been one of the most active and most successful fields of soft
drug design. there is a frequent misconception regarding
soft steroids that has to be clarified. often, the soft nature is
associated with fast hydrolytic degradation, but this is not
necessarily so. if hydrolysis is too rapid, then only weak activity may be obtained. the desired increase of the therapeutic index can be achieved only if the drug is sufficiently stable to reach the receptor sites at the target organ and to produce its desired effect, but the free, non-protein-bound drug
undergoes facile hydrolysis to avoid unwanted, systemic side
effects. in order to successfully separate the desired local
activity from systemic toxicity, an adequate balance between
intrinsic activity, solubility/lipophilicity, tissue distribution,
protein binding, and rate of metabolic deactivation has to be
achieved. in the case of slow, sustained release to the general
circulatory system from the delivery site, even a relatively
slow hydrolysis could result in a very low, almost steady
state systemic concentration.

corticosteroid design for the treatment of asthma

current pharmaceutical design, 2006, vol. 12, no. 25 3249

first generation cortienic acid-based soft steroids:
 xxxd2509xxx  etabonate and analogs

compounds approach and even exceed the rrba of the most
potent corticosteroids known.

 xxxd2509xxx  etabonate (le, 7, fig. 8) is an active corticosteroid that lacks serious side effects and that received
final fda approval in 1998 as the active ingredient of two
ophthalmic preparations ( xxxd2509xxx ,  xxxd2509xxx ) [78-80]. currently, it is the only corticosteroid approved by the fda for
use in all inflammatory and allergy-related ophthalmic disorders, including inflammation after cataract surgery, uveitis,
allergic conjunctivitis, and giant papillary conjunctivitis
(gpc).

le was selected for development based on various considerations including the therapeutic index, availability,
synthesis, and “softness” (the rate and easiness of metabolic
deactivation). development, even if technically relatively
easy, involved various companies, mainly due to financial
problems. first, as mentioned, it involved otsuka pharmaceutical company (1980-1985) in performing synthesis, preclinical studies, animal toxicology, and limited phase i/ii
human studies directed toward dermatological use. xenon
vision inc., which was specifically established to explore the
potential ophthalmic use (1986-1991), performed regulatory
animal toxicology, phase i and phase ii human studies, and
the establishment of proof of concept in giant papillary conjunctivitis and allergic conjunctivitis. finally, the involvement of pharmos corporation and bausch and lomb inc.
(1992-1996: phase iii studies in gpc, allergic conjunctivitis,
uveitis, and post cataract surgery), led to submission of the
new drug applications (ndas) in 1995 and 1996, respectively.

le resulted from a classic inactive metabolite-based soft
drug approach that used cortienic acid (4) as starting point
(fig. 8) [80-87]. as mentioned, hydrocortisone (1) undergoes a variety of oxidative and reductive metabolic conversions (fig. 6) [46]. oxidation of its dihydroxyacetone side
chain leads to formation of cortienic acid (4) through a 21aldehyde (21-dehydrocortisol) and a 21-acid (cortisolic acid,
3). cortienic acid is an ideal lead for the inactive metabolite
approach because it lacks corticosteroid activity and is a
major metabolite excreted in human urine. to obtain new
active soft compounds, the pharmacophore moieties of the
17alpha and beta side chains have to be restored by suitable isosteric/isoelectronic substitution containing esters or other
types of functions that restore the original corticosteroid activity and also incorporate hydrolytic features to ensure adequate metabolic properties. modifications of the 17beta ester
function and the 17alpha hydroxy function, together with other
changes (introduction of ∆1,2, fluorination at 6alpha and/or 9alpha,
methylation at 16alpha or 16beta), led to a host of analogues representing the first generation of cortienic acid-based soft steroids (5, fig. 8). over 120 of these soft steroids have been
synthesized. the first soft analogues of this kind were synthesized soon after the introduction of the soft drug concept
[50] during the late 1970s, followed by a systematic synthetic study performed in collaboration with otsuka pharmaceutical company (japan) in 1980-1981 [54, 81, 88]. critical
functions for activity are a haloester in the 17beta position and a
novel carbonate [81, 83] or ether [89] substitution in the
17alpha-position.
incorporation of 17alpha carbonates or ethers was preferred
over 17alpha esters to enhance stability and to prevent formation
of mixed anhydrides that might be produced by reaction of a
17alpha ester with a 17beta acid functionality. such mixed anhydrides were assumed toxic and probably cataractogenic. a
variety of 17beta esters were synthesized. because this position
is an important pharmacophore that is sensitive to small
modifications, the freedom of choice was relatively limited.
for example, although chloromethyl or fluoromethyl esters
showed very good activity, the chloroethyl or alphachloroethylidene derivatives demonstrated very weak activity. simple alkyl esters also proved virtually inactive. consequently, the 17beta chloromethyl ester was held constant and
17alpha-carbonates with different substituents on the steroid
skeleton were varied for further investigation. le, and some
of the other soft steroids, provided a significant improvement
of the therapeutic index determined as the ratio between the
anti-inflammatory activity and the thymus involution activity
[80, 90, 91]. furthermore, binding studies using rat lung cytosolic corticosteroid receptors showed that some of the

early studies in rabbits [92, 93] and rats [84] demonstrated that, consistent with its design, le is indeed active, is
metabolized into its predicted metabolites, and these metabolites are inactive [83]. the pharmacokinetic profile of
le indicated that, when absorbed systemically, it is rapidly
transformed to the inactive 17beta-carboxylic acid metabolite
and eliminated from the body mainly through the bile and
urine [84, 85, 87]. it did not effect the intraocular pressure in
rabbits [93] an observation confirmed later in various human
studies [94]. consistent with the soft nature of this steroid,
systemic levels or effects cannot be detected even after
chronic ocular administration [95].
clinical studies proved that it is a safe and effective
treatment for contact lens-associated gpc, seasonal allergic
conjunctivitis, post-operative inflammation, or uveitis [78,
79]. based on promising results from animal studies [80, 86,
87], le is also being developed for treatment of asthma,
rhinitis, colitis, and dermatological problems. its airway activity will be reviewed separately.
second generation cortienic acid-based soft steroids:
etiprednol dicloacetate and analogs
more recently, a new class of soft steroids with 17alphadichloroester substituent has been identified (6, fig. 8) [96].
this is a unique design: no known corticosteroid contains
halogen substituents at the 17alpha position. nevertheless, the
pharmacophore portions of these second generation cortienic
acid-based soft steroids, including the halogen atoms at 17alpha,
can be positioned so as to provide excellent overlap with
those of the traditional corticosteroids [43]. dichlorinated
substituents seem required for activity and sufficiently soft
nature, and two justifications seem likely. first, with dichlorinated substituents, one of the cl atoms will necessarily
point in the direction needed for pharmacophore overlap, but
with monochlorinated substituents, steric hindrance will
force the lone cl atom to point away from this desired direction. second, whereas compared to the unsubstituted ester,
dichloro substituents cause an about twenty-fold increase in
the second order rate constant kcat/km of enzymatic hydroly-

etiprednol dicloacetate

fig. (8). design of first (5) and second (6) generation cortienic acid-based soft steroids, and they selected representative compounds  xxxd2509xxx  etabonate (le, 7) and etiprednol dicloacetate (ed, 8), respectively.

sis in acetate esters, monochloro substituents do not cause
any change [97].

any portion absorbed systemically following topical application is hydrolyzed into inactive species.

contrary to the first generation of soft steroids (5), in this
second generation of soft steroids (6), hydrolysis primarily
cleaves not the 17beta-positioned, but the 17alpha-positioned ester.
nevertheless, the corresponding metabolites are also inactive. from this series, etiprednol dicloacetate (ed, 8, fig. 8)
was selected for development. ed has shown better rba
than le, and was proven as, or even more effective, than
budesonide (bud) in various asthma models. in agreement
with its soft nature, ed was found as having low toxicity in
animal models and in human clinical trials [96, 98-100]. the
no observable adverse effect level (noael) of ed after 28day oral administration was found to be 2 mg/kg in rats and
dogs, approximately 40 times higher than that of bud [98].
the airway activity of ed will also be summarized separately.

however, the low intrinsic activity of this steroid hindered its widespread use. the  xxxg1601xxx  affinity and the topical anti-inflammatory potency of fluocortin
butyl (9) are several-fold lower than those of dex [103].
fluocortin butyl ameliorated allergic rhinitis at daily doses of
2-8 mg divided into 2-4 daily inhalations [106, 107], but it
did not protect against bronchial obstruction in bronchial
provocation tests even at 8 mg doses divided into 4 daily
inhalations, in contrast to a tenfold lower dose of bdp [108].

fluocortin butyl
fluocortin butyl (9, fig. 9) is an anti-inflammatory steroid obtained in one of the early approaches aimed at integrating ester moieties into steroid structures. metabolism
studies on fluocortolone revealed a number of oxidative and
reductive metabolites in human urine [101] including fluocortolone-21-acid, an inactive metabolite. synthesis and
pharmacological evaluation of its different ester derivatives
yielded fluocortin butyl (9, vaspit ®, novoderm ®, varlane ®),
the butyl ester of a c-21 carboxy steroid [102-105]. the ester is an anti-inflammatory agent of rather weak activity, and

itrocinonide
a soft steroid series containing 17beta methyl-carbonate
ester moieties susceptible toward hydrolysis was also developed during the 1980s [109]. receptor affinities varied significantly with the substituents and with the stereochemistry
of the chiral center at the 17beta ester. the selected doublefluorinated compound, itrocinonide (itr, 10, fig. 9), had an
rba similar to bud and a sufficiently rapid rate of in vitro
hydrolysis (t1/2 = 30 min in human blood at 37 °c) [109].
the in vivo potency of itr was less than that of bud, but,
in agreement with soft drug design principles, the ratio between its anti-inflammatory efficacy in airways/lung and its
systemic steroid activity (i.e., thymus involution or plasma
cortisol suppression) was much better than the corresponding
ratio for budesonide. it also had very good systemic tolerance in human volunteers and asthmatics. owing to its short
plasma half-live (approx. 30 min, which is about 1/5th that of

corticosteroid design for the treatment of asthma

bud and fluocortin butyl), itr lacked measurable systemic
glucocorticoid activity. in patients with asthma or seasonal
rhinitis, itr administered as a dry powder formulation did
exert some anti-asthmatic and anti-rhinitic efficacy, but these
effects were not sufficient enough to compete with the efficacy of current inhaled steroids [109].
so-called “antedrug” steroids
various, mostly prednisolone-based ester derivatives,
were synthesized and investigated in a series of attempts
designated as “antedrug” designs by h. j. lee’s and coworkers [40, 110-119]. unfortunately, the “antedrug” terminology only creates additional confusion. first, because the
definition of an “antedrug” [40, 110, 120] is essentially
identical to that of a soft drug, but was introduced considerably later [50-53]. second, because the “ante” prefix, which is
very similar in meaning to the “pro” prefix (e.g., prior to),
implies the conceptual opposite of a soft drug, i.e., an inactive agent that has to be activated by metabolism. therefore,
the “antedrug” terminology is conceptually confusing and
should be avoided.
these “antedrug” attempts were aimed to improve the
local-to-systemic activity ratio of anti-inflammatory steroids
and may be considered as based on hypothetical inactive
metabolites. studied compounds include ester derivatives of
steroid 21-oic acids [110], a number of 16alpha-carboxylate
analogues (e.g., 11) [40, 111-113, 116], 6-carboxylate analogues [114], and (16alpha,17alpha-d) isoxazolines derivatives [115,
117, 118]. some of these compounds were found to have
relatively low activity, similar to that of hydrocortisone or
prednisolone, and they also achieved some, but not very significant, improvement in the local-to-systemic activity ratio.
rrba of two such 9alpha-fluorinated steroids for the cytosolic
 xxxg1601xxx  are 8 and 4 for fp16cm (11) and its
21-acetate derivative fp16cmac, respectively [40]. for
comparison, le, a non-fluorinated soft steroid, has an rrba
of around 150 [83]. as a possible attempt to increase topical
potency by a different approach, the 17alpha-dehydro steroid
fdp16cm was conjugated through an ester bond to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs such as ibuprofen (12)
[120]. topical potency was not increased compared to the
nonconjugated steroid (because of decreased receptor binding); however, the local-to-systemic activity ratio was still
improved compared to prednisone.
glucocorticoid gamma-lactones
recently various gamma-lactone derivatives including 21-thio
derivatives of  xxxd2128xxx  with gamma-lactones and
cyclic carbonates (e.g., 13) [121] and sulfur-linked gamma-lactones
incorporated at the 17beta-position (e.g., 14) [122] were also
explored. for these compounds, human serum paraoxonase
(e.c. 3.1.8.1) was claimed to be the metabolizing enzyme
[121], which is of interest because this enzyme has a much
lower activity in lung tissue than in plasma, and thus it can
provide improved site-specific activity for inhaled compounds. contrary to the corresponding esters, 21-thio-linked
lactones were stable in human lung s9 preparation (t1/2 >480
min for 13), but rapidly hydrolyzed in human plasma (t1/2 < 1
min) [121]. a higher metabolic stability in lung tissues than
in corresponding plasma has been independently confirmed
[109]. the rate of hydrolysis was also rapid in plasma for the

current pharmaceutical design, 2006, vol. 12, no. 25 3251

17-linked lactones possessing a sulfur in the alpha-position of
the butyrolactone group (t1/2 < 5 min), whereas c-linked
lactones were stable [122]. among the compounds of this
series, 14 showed promising topical anti-inflammatory activity in the rat ear edema model and much lower systemic
effects than bud in the thymus involution test. nevertheless, development of these series for asthma has been discontinued, most likely because too rapid enzymatic inactivation at the desired site of action resulted in reduced antiinflammatory efficacy [123].
other corticosteroid designs
other groups also made attempts to separate local and
systemic effects by integrating moieties susceptible to rapid,
non-hepatic metabolism within the corticosteroid structure.
one of the more successful attempts explored 17alpha(alkoxycarbonyl)alkanoates analogues (15) of  xxxd1719xxx 
propionate [124]. again, this can be considered as a hypothetical inactive metabolite-based approach, and a corresponding metabolite (15, n = 2, r = h) has indeed been
shown to be inactive. esters that were susceptible to rapid
hydrolysis exhibited good separation of topical antiinflammatory to systemic activity. the study also indicated
the existence of an optimal volume for the 17alpha side chain.
for example, the methyl succinate derivative (15, n = 2, r =
methyl) showed as potent topical anti-inflammatory activity
as  xxxd1719xxx , but a dramatically reduced thymolytic activity. therefore, the corresponding therapeutic index
was increased more than 130-fold compared to  xxxd1719xxx 
propionate. it has to be mentioned, however, that for this
compound (15) as well as for the glucocorticoid gamma-lactones
(13, 14) active compounds may be formed from the inactive
metabolite (for example, in the case of 15 by chemical cleavage of the succinate ester to the active  xxxd1719xxx ) resulting
in a possible active → inactive → active sequence.
another effort involved the design, synthesis, and testing
of a colon-targeted pro-soft drug (16) for possible oral treatment of ulcerative colitis [125]. these c-20 oxyprednisolonate 21-esters contain glucopyranosyl ethers to render the
pro-soft drugs hydrophilic and thus poorly absorbable in the
small intestine. removal of the glucopyranosyl ethers releases the corresponding active soft drug. this process is
mediated by colonic bacteria within the colonic lumen as
demonstrated in vivo after administration in the jejunum of
guinea pigs. in the systemic circulation, degradation of the
c-21 esters rapidly releases the inactive acid metabolites.
interestingly, the half-lives in guinea pig plasma for the two
different ester stereoisomers were quite different, being 2.6
and 166.8 min for the 20r-dihydroprednisolonate and 20sdihydroprednisolonate, respectively. somewhat later, steroid-17-yl methyl glycolates with succinyl group at c20 derived from prednisolone and dex (17) were also investigated by the same group [126]. in fact, this is again a prosoft drug-type approach, as first an active compound, the 21ester, is released, and then this is further metabolized into an
inactive metabolite.
in another separate study, three series of compounds
were synthesized in which sulfur-containing amino acids
were incorporated into the steroidal structure at the 21 position [127]. the rationale for this, which the authors considered as being more-or-less along the principles of soft drug

design, was that sulfur-containing compounds have shown,
generally, a good cutaneous distribution as well as relative
rapid bio-transformation and fast elimination with the oxidized metabolites being inactive in most cases. however,
drugs relying on such oxidative metabolism cannot be considered true soft drugs (see also the next paragraph). the
selected most promising compound of this series was 18, for
which in vivo results showed a local activity about 10 times
less and a systemic activity about 970 times less than that of
dex.
finally, before closing this section, it should be mentioned that some other steroid drugs such as butixocort 21propionate [128, 129], tipredane [130, 131], and fluticasone
propionate (fp, 23, fig. 10) are often and erroneously called
soft drugs (see, for example, [10, 123, 132]). these drugs are
indeed metabolized rapidly, but by oxidative mechanisms in
the liver [129, 131, 133]. thiol ester corticosteroid such as
fp have been shown to be metabolized in the liver by oxidative cleavage of the thiol ester bond and not by hydrolysis in
the plasma [133]. consequently, even if fp itself lacks oral
activity because high hepatic first-pass metabolism to the
corresponding (inactive) 17-carboxylic acid, it has systemic
effects if given subcutaneously [134]. fp has a relatively
long terminal half-life after inhaled administration (around
13 h, see table 3), and it also has increased terminal halflives after inhalation, which usually is an indication of slow,

rate-limiting absorption (“flip-flop pharmacokinetics”) [34].
the slow elimination of fp can lead to accumulation during
repeated dosing. this accumulation may explain the doserelated cortisol suppression seen with fp [135] and the
marked decrease in plasma cortisol seen during treatment
with fp within the clinical dose range [136]. in fact, fp has
been shown to exhibit significantly steeper dose related systemic bioactivity as measured by cortisol suppression than
bdp, bud, or taa [16].  xxxd1690xxx  (cic, 26) [137]
sometimes is also erroneously classified as a soft drug (see,
for example, [123, 138]). cic, just as bdp, is an inactive
ester prodrug that has to be has to be metabolically transformed into its active metabolite (cicam) to exert activity at
the gr.
airway activity of soft corticosteroids
as already discussed, the development of icss for the
treatment of asthma and allergic rhinitis still remains a very
important field for drug designers and is mostly focused
along the lines of minimizing systemic side effects while
retaining high local activity. newer corticosteroids, which
are highly active and have minimal oral bioavailability, are
much safer, but there is need and room for further improvement. table 3 gives a summary of relevant properties for
icss that are currently marketed or under development (see
fig. 8 and fig. 10 for structures). the relationship between

corticosteroid design for the treatment of asthma

current pharmaceutical design, 2006, vol. 12, no. 25 3253

these parameters and effectiveness/safety is complex [14, 34,
139]. nevertheless, high lung deposition/targeting, good
receptor binding (rrba), and prolonged pulmonary retention
(as measured, for example, by mat, the mean absorption
time after inhalation) are some of the properties considered
relevant when looking at the benefits and improved efficacy
of icss [139]. low oral bioavailability (fpo), small particle
size, increased plasma protein binding (funb), rapid metabolism, high clearance (cl), and lower systemic half-life (t1/2)
tend to be associated with reduced risks for adverse effects.

æ). the ics data of table 3 are more-or-less in agreement
with these generalized observations. therefore, calculated
log po/w data allow comparisons for the newer steroids for
which no experimental or clinical data are available yet. a
brief review of the airway activity of the two soft corticosteroids le and ed that are currently in clinical development
as prospective icss and that are particularly well-suited to
separate local activity and systemic toxicity is included in
the next two subchapters.

when comparing the data of table 3, one need to remember that  xxxd294xxx  (bdp, 25) is, in
fact, a prodrug; i.e., it is inactive and needs to be transformed
(hydrolyzed) into its active beclomethasone 17alpha-monopropionate (bmp) form.  xxxd1690xxx  (cic, 26) is slightly more
lipophilic, but otherwise very similar to bdp: both are inactive 21-esters activated by hydrolysis, both have active metabolites that are 17alpha monoesters, and both have about similar rrba values. in fact, because of its large 17alpha-side chain,
cic probably already results in a worsened fit at the gr than
bdp as the rrba of its active metabolite (cicam) is less than
that of bmp despite an increased lipophilicity (table 3).

 xxxd2509xxx  etabonate
several animal models have been developed to test the
pharmacological activity of drug candidates intended for the
treatment of asthma or allergic rhinitis [142, 143]. following
a number of in vitro and in vivo studies that confirmed the
potent and safe airway activity of le [80, 144-148], the
clinical development of le as an ics for the treatment of
allergic rhinitis and possibly asthma is currently ongoing. in
vitro studies in human blood and nasal polyp cells, which are
considered to be an adequate model of chronic respiratory
mucosal inflammation, showed that le has activity similar
to dex or bdp as measured by the ic 50 values for inhibition
of endotoxin (lipopolysaccharide, lps)-induced release of
 xxxg2296xxx  ( xxxg2296xxx ) in diluted human blood and
for inhibition of anti-ige-induced granulocyte-macrophage
colony stimulating factor (gm-csf) release in dispersed
nasal polyp cells [145].

calculated octanol-water partition coefficients (log po/w)
were included in table 3 because they can be quite accurately computed based on structure alone (i.e., calculated and
experimental values are in good agreement) and because
they are lipophilicity descriptors [140] known to be good
predictors not only of pharmacokinetic properties in general
[141], but also of binding affinity at the gr [43]. increased
lipophilicity (log p ä) tends to correlate with increased receptor binding (rrba ä), increased protein- (funb æ) and
tissue-binding (vdss, t1/2 ä), prolonged pulmonary retention
(mat ä), and increased hepatic first-pass inactivation (fpo

experimental octanol-water partition coefficients (log p exp.) are from [153, 159]. calculated log p values (log p calc.) are averages of three computer-calculated values (qlogp,
clogp, and acd/logp) as described in [43]. relative receptor-binding affinities (rrba) are from the references as shown and are compared to dexamethasone (rrbadex = 100).
because some experimental values are quite scattered, whenever multiple values were available, average values are shown. most pharmacokinetic parameters are from the compilations in refs. [14, 139] (and from [1, 9, 17, 35, 153, 155, 160]), and they are as follows: funb: fraction unbound, vdss: volume of distribution at steady state, cl: clearance, t1/2,inh: terminal half-life after inhalation, t1/2,iv: terminal half-life, t1/2,rb: corticosteroid receptor-binding half-life, mat: mean absorption time after inhalation, finh: overall systemic bioavailability
after inhalation, fins: overall systemic bioavailability after intranasal administration, fpo: oral bioavailability. for simplicity, when a range of values was available, the mean is shown.

i. pulm., comparable to that of bdp (0.11 µg/kg) and significantly better than that of dex (10 µg/kg) [144, 146, 148]. in
similar studies involving late phase allergic eosinophilia in
guinea pigs, eosinophilia in balf was reduced dosedependently by le (id50 = 29 µg/kg), by dex (id50 = 134
µg/kg), and by bdp (id50 = 19 µg/kg) [144, 148]. in this set
of experiments where the oa challenge was applied 2 h after
the dose with steroids, fp showed the highest activity (id50 =
0.89 µg/kg). it was found, however, that when le and fp
were compared in a study [144] with longer separation (6 h)
between administration of steroids and oa challenge, le
still showed a strong activity with id50 = 77 µg/kg, but fp
showed only a very weak and not dose-dependent effect
(fig. 11). these data indicate that le produced a strong antiinflammatory effect in vivo after intranasal and intrapulmonary administration. interestingly, le showed significantly
longer lasting action than fp. le also showed promising
results in a sheep model for asthma [80]. in this study, animals were challenged with the ascaris suum antigen and
specific lung resistance (srl) was monitored for up to 8 h.
bdp was used as comparator, and both le and bdp inhibited the late phase response.
le nasal spray for treatment of allergic rhinitis has already been evaluated in a number of clinical studies, and
they indicate that le nasal spray (400 and 800 µg once
daily) could be a safe and well-tolerated treatment for up to
two weeks for allergic rhinitis. a phase 1, single center, ran-

domized, parallel group study conducted in 32 healthy males
demonstrated that the safety and tolerability of 400 and 800
µg of le nasal spray administered for 14 days was comparable with placebo and 200 µg of  xxxd2145xxx  (fp)
[149]. there was no significant suppression of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (hpa) axis at any of the le or fp
doses tested as indicated by the area under the 24 h plasma
cortisol concentration time curve (auc). fp, however,
showed a clear trend toward 24 h cortisol suppression even if
not at statistically significant levels [149]. fig. (12) shows
the mean “sneezing severity” profile during allergen challenge on day 14 from a double-blind, parallel-group trial in
48 patients with allergic rhinitis to grass pollen that received
a single daily dose of 400 µg le nasal spray (n = 24) or placebo (n = 24) for 14 days and underwent five 4 h allergen
challenges with grass pollen (dactylis glomerata, 8000 pollen/m3) in an environmental exposure unit (eeu) at a baseline visit and at days 1, 3, 7, and 14 of treatment [150].

the pharmacological effects of ed have also been evaluated in various animal models of airway diseases, and they
all found ed to be at least equipotent with bud. for example, ed was investigated in an animal model of allergen
(oa) sensitized and challenged bn rats [99]. antigeninduced airway eosinophil infiltration into the bronchoalveolar tissues was reduced dose-dependently by ed with an

and 6 h prior to challenge (right side) (le 300 µg/kg, fp 5.0 µg/kg i. trach.). when icss were administered 6 h prior to challenge, a strong
effect was still observed for le, but not for fp. data are mean ± sem. notation: sc = lactose treated/saline challenged control group;

and perivascular edema formation (ed50 of 2.9 µg/kg vs. 8.5

fig. (13). comparison between the effects of ed (0.1–100 µg/kg) and bud (0.1–100 µg/kg) on (a) antigen-induced airway eosinophil infiltration and (b) antigen-induced perivascular edema formation into the bronchoalveolar tissues of actively sensitized bn rats by single intratracheal dry powder administration 2 h prior to challenge. data are mean ± se for 4-5 animals per group. *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, and ***p
< 0.001 compared to vehicle-treated, allergen challenged animals.

the transrepressing and transactivating activity of ed
and bud were also compared by measuring their inhibition
in  xxxg1170xxx  production of a stimulated human monocyte cell
line and by evaluating glucocorticoid-induced increase in the
activity of tyrosine-amino-transferase of a rat hepatoma cell
line, respectively. measured activities were expressed relative to dex. ed was found to be a dissociated glucocorticoid, i.e., to possess reduced transactivating activity with a
preserved transrepressing activity (fig. 14). glucocorticoids
are signaling through a single receptor (gr), but the result of
the signal can be either increase (activation) or inhibition
(repression) of gene expression. transactivation is mediated
by binding of the hormone-activated receptor to a defined
dna sequence, called glucocorticoid response element
(gre). this process may account for some of the unwanted
effects of glucocorticoids via the increase in expression of
genes involved in gluconeogenesis and development of arterial or ocular tensions. transrepression, which seems to be
the main mechanism by which glucocorticoids suppress inflammation, may be the result of binding to negative gres,
but it occurs mainly by interaction with transcription factors
(ap-1 and  xxxg1559xxx ), which control the gene of many  xxxd2315xxx -

matory mediators from  xxxg1170xxx  to  xxxg363xxx . hence, the dissociation of transactivating and transrepressing activity seen
for ed is a likely advantage that may further help in separating the beneficial anti-inflammatory activity from the undesired side effects [151].
conclusion
there is an increasing amount of information on the
structural elements required for high and specific glucocorticoid activity. there is also an increasing amount of information on the properties required not only for effective, but also
for safe long-term treatment with inhaled/intranasal corticosteroids. despite considerable improvements in the therapeutic index of icss since their introduction, there is a continuous need for better separation of local effects from systemic side effects, especially since icss still are the most
effective treatment available for allergic airway diseases and
are likely to remain the cornerstone of managing persistent
asthma/allergic rhinitis in the foreseeable future. soft corticosteroids are particularly well-suited for this purpose, and
because of their promising airway activity, both le and ed

fig. (14) . comparison of the transrepressing and transactivating properties of dex, bud, and ed. transrepressing activities were determined using the human monocytic cell line, thp1. cells were stimulated with lps and silica in the presence of different concentrations of
the steroids and the production of  xxxg1170xxx  was measured. transactivating activities were determined by measuring the steroid-induced increase
in the activity of tyrosine-amino-transferase (tat, which is involved in the glucocorticoid-dependent stimulation of neoglucogenesis) using
the rat hepatoma cell line (htc, ecacc 93129198). the activity of dex was taken as 100% at each molar concentration, and relative activities were calculated for the other steroids. average ± sd of three experiments for concentrations of 10–7 m are shown.
