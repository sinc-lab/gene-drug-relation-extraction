 xxxd2849xxx  is a prodrug of  xxxd3481xxx , which is a potent and selective
inhibitor of cox-2. intravenous preparation of  xxxd2849xxx  is in phase iii
clinical trials for the management of acute and severe post-surgical pain. it
is the only cox-2 inhibitor that is available in a parenteral formulation.
clinical results compare  xxxd2849xxx  with ketorolac, a nsaid, which is the
only non-narcotic analgesic available in parenteral formulation that can be
administered for the relief of moderate to severe acute pain. pharmacokinetic studies have shown that  xxxd2849xxx  is converted to  xxxd3481xxx  within a
short time following administration by im. or iv. injection. in clinical trials,
 xxxd2849xxx  compares favourably with ketorolac and produces less gastric or
duodenal ulcers, the predominant adverse effect, than ketorolac.
 xxxd2849xxx , thus, fulfils some of the desirable characteristics of an ideal
non-narcotic analgesic for severe post-surgical pain and has application in
other acutely painful conditions.  xxxd2849xxx  is expected to be filed for
approval before the end of 2000 and is expected to be introduced in the
market in 2001. it has favourable prospects for a fair share of the
post-surgical pain relief market which is valued at approximately us$ 1
billion for the year 2000.

1. introduction
the focus of this article is the use of parenteral formulation of  xxxd2849xxx  (a
prodrug of  xxxd3481xxx ), for the treatment of acute post-surgical pain.
 xxxd3481xxx  belongs to the non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs (nsaids)
and is undergoing clinical trials for the treatment of arthritis and pain [1].
these drugs inhibit the synthesis of prostaglandins and thromboxane by
inhibiting the enzyme cox-1 or cox-2. the older nsaids were
non-specific for the different forms of cox, although they may have shown
varying degrees of selectivity. inhibition of cox-1 is associated with side
effects such as gastrointestinal irritation, ulcers and haemorrhage [2]. the
development of cox-2-selective drugs, such as celecoxib and rofecoxib
(approved in the us for acute pain indications), has resulted in nsaids with
good analgesic and anti-inflammatory effects, without the gastrointestinal
and antiplatelet side effect profile of older drugs. these are given orally
mostly for arthritis. celecoxib has also been approved for use in preventing
colon cancer in patients with familial adenomatous polyposis. few nsaids
can be administered parenterally; ketorolac is one of these non-narcotic
analgesics which can be administered for the relief of moderate to severe
acute pain. although very effective, its use is associated with gastrointestinal ulceration, renal function impairment and predisposition to increased

operative bleeding. there has been interest in the
development of a safe non-narcotic parenteral
analgesic for post-surgical pain, moving away from
the dominant drugs, morphine and its derivatives.
2. post-surgical and acute pain
acute pain is the normal predicted physiological
response to an adverse chemical, thermal or
mechanical stimulus, which may be associated with
surgery, trauma or acute illness. acute pain management has become an important issue because of its
humanitarian aspects, associated morbidity and
mortality. there is an emphasis on an integrated
approach to acute pain treatment and acute rehabilitation so that the patient can return to work as soon as
possible. identification and management of acute
pain syndromes are important to prevent pain from
becoming chronic and involving the nervous system.
post-surgical pain here is considered a type of acute
pain and some of the findings and management in
post-surgical pain are also applicable to other acute
pain syndromes. similarly, animal models for study of
acute pain can be used to evaluate drugs used for
relief of post-surgical pain.
2.1 epidemiology

it is estimated that over 25 million operations are
performed annually in the us and most involve some
form of pain management. these estimates include
over 600,000 total joint replacements, of which
300,000 are hip replacements. with an increase in the
ageing population, these figures are expected to rise.
2.2 current

management

post-surgical pain is managed with the use of nsaids,
opioids and local anaesthetics [3]. oral nsaids are
effective for mild-to-moderate pain. available data
suggest that celecoxib has analgesic efficacy in
patients with post-surgical dental pain, although this
is yet to be confirmed [4]. parenteral opioids, usually
im. or iv., are used for moderate to severe pain and are
switched to oral formulations as soon as tolerated.
parenteral ketorolac is used for moderate to severe
pain in patients who are intolerant to opioids. other
methods of delivery of opioids are patient controlled
analgesia and spinal; epidural or intrathecal. local
anaesthetics are indicated in particular settings and
provide effective regional analgesia. various methods
of administration are by local nerve blocks, by
epidural catheter or intrathecally. several drugs,
© ashley publications ltd. all rights reserved.

besides opioids and local anaesthetics, have been
used intrathecally for relief of post-surgical pain.
these include clonidine (alpha-2 agonist) and ketamine
(n-methyl-d-aspartate (nmda) receptor antagonist).
analgesic drugs remain the mainstay of post-surgical
pain management. various psychological methods
have also been used to reduce post-operative pain
and include psychological support, cognitive coping
strategies and relaxation training. acupuncture has
also been used.
selection of an analgesic in the post-operative period
is made according to the type of surgery. fentanyl is
the most commonly used drug for patients who have
undergone brain operations.  xxxd3094xxx  (glaxowellcome’s  xxxd3094xxx ™), a selective µ-opioid agonist, is
preferred by some because of its short duration of
action (half-life of 3 - 5 min), which enables frequent
neurological assessments to be made after temporary
discontinuation of the iv. infusion [5].
pre-emptive analgesia means administration of an
analgesic agent prior to elective surgery to reduce
post-surgical pain intensity. the reliability of this
approach is controversial and depends on the type of
surgery. epidural pre-emptive analgesia is effective in
limb and breast surgeries, but ineffective in abdominal
surgery. epidural morphine and iv. low-dose
ketamine or combinations of these have been investigated in controlled clinical trials [6]. the results
suggest that for definitive pre-emptive analgesia,
blockade of opioid and nmda receptors is necessary.
these treatments provided significant, but not definitive, post-surgical pain relief. epidural morphine may
affect the spinal cord segmentally, whereas iv.
ketamine may block brain stem sensitisation via the
vagus nerve during upper abdominal surgery.
intrathecal ziconotide (n-type calcium channel
blocker), recently approved for treatment of chronic
pain, is in phase iii clinical trials as pre-emptive
analgesic for elective surgical procedures [7].
3. overview of the market
the estimate of current pain therapy market is us$ 5
billion worldwide. it is difficult to separate acute from
chronic pain in this market, although some
conditions, such as rheumatoid arthritis and cancer
pain, have defined markets and pain can be associated with acute as well as chronic pain. the
post-surgical worldwide pain market is estimated to
be about us$ 1 billion in the year 2000. although this

market is expanding and will increase to us$ 9 billion
by the year 2005, the expansion in the post-surgical
pain market would be less than that of other categories of pain. as surgical procedures get refined and
minimally invasive surgery is replacing some standard
major surgical procedures, the post-surgical pain is
reduced, in intensity as well as duration. some of the
agents used for post-surgical pain can also be used for
other acute painful conditions and this market thus
overlaps with that of the acute pain market not associated with well defined conditions.  xxxd2849xxx  is
expected to be introduced in the market in the year
2001 and from an initial market value of us$ 200
million in 2002, would grow to about us$ 500 million
in the year 2005.

 xxxd2849xxx  is a prodrug of  xxxd3481xxx , which is a
potent and selective inhibitor of cox-2. there is also
considerable evidence that cox inhibitors may alter
nociception by acting on prostaglandin production
within the cns, where they can modulate

neurotransmitter release. prostaglandins are considered to be prototypes of sensitising agents because
they lower the threshold for nociceptive pain. they
are synthesised from  xxxd208xxx , released from
membrane phospholipids in response to inflammation. free  xxxd208xxx  is metabolised to
prostaglandin h2 by the cox pathway. prostaglandins e2 and h2 increase the electrical excitability
of sensory neurones and are known to mediate
bradykinin-induced hyperalgesia. the analgesic
properties of aspirin and other nsaids, which inhibit
the cox pathway, show the importance of
prostaglandin-induced hyperalgesia. other proposed
mechanisms of action include a direct action at an
excitatory or inhibitory amino acid site.
5.3.1 preclinical

studies

intravenous administration of  xxxd2849xxx  shows
considerable activity in the carrageenan foot pad
oedema model, a sensitive acute analgesic assay [8].
maximum oedema and pain occurs in the rat foot pad
3 h after administration of carrageenan. at this point,
the effect of 30 mg/kg iv. ketorolac was compared
with the same dose of  xxxd2849xxx . with both drugs,
maximal analgesic effect was achieved within 1 h [9].
5.4 pharmacokinetics
5.4.1 preclinical

studies

in vitro metabolic studies with human liver
microsomes show that  xxxd2849xxx  is completely
converted to  xxxd3481xxx . following iv. administration
to dogs or cynomolgus monkeys,  xxxd2849xxx  was not
completely converted to  xxxd3481xxx  and a significant
amount of the compound was eliminated unchanged
in the urine [9]. however,  xxxd2849xxx  is completely
converted to  xxxd3481xxx  in rats and the half-life of this
conversion is about 15 min.

studies

one clinical study correlated the pharmacokinetics of
 xxxd2849xxx  with onset and duration of analgesia in
post-operative (third molar surgery) dental pain. the

mg) was compared with im. doses of ketorolac (30
mg) and placebo. the cmax and auc increased
proportionally with dose. the study concluded that
 xxxd2849xxx  and ketorolac were significantly superior to
placebo in onset, duration, time to meaningful and
perceptible pain relief and were not different from
each other. there was good correlation of the
pharmacokinetic data with onset and duration of
analgesia [10].
5.5 clinical

trials

results of clinical trials were reported at a 1999 conference [11]. one phase ii dose-range study evaluated iv.
 xxxd2849xxx  1, 2, 5, 10 and 20 mg in comparison with iv.
ketorolac 30 mg dose in 50 subjects. the onset of
analgesia was similar for  xxxd2849xxx  20 mg (median 14
min) and ketorolac 30 mg (14 min) with the 2 and 10
mg doses of  xxxd2849xxx  also having detectable onset at
early time points. the mean pain relief scores for
 xxxd2849xxx  20 mg and ketorolac were similar over the
first 12 h of evaluation, with lesser activity for lower
doses.  xxxd2849xxx  20 mg showed greater duration of
activity over 24 h compared with ketorolac. a second
study reported that iv. doses of  xxxd2849xxx , 5 mg or
greater, provided significant analgesia as compared
with placebo. the results of these studies have not
been published as yet.
efficacy of  xxxd2849xxx  to combat post-surgical dental
pain was evaluated in a double-blind, randomised
study presented at the annual meeting of the
american society for clinical pharmacology and
therapeutics 2000 [12]. analgesic efficacy of iv. doses
of 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 50 and 100 mg  xxxd2849xxx  was
compared with 30 mg of ketorolac and placebo. all
active treatments were superior to placebo. the
primary objectives of this study were to compare the
analgesic efficacy of seven different  xxxd2849xxx  doses
compared with placebo using primary efficacy
variables:
• pain intensity difference
• pain relief
• sum of pain intensity difference and pain relief
• time to onset of analgesia
• time to perceptible pain relief
• time to rescue medication
pharmacokinetic samples were obtained throughout
the 24 h period. all active treatments were
exp. opin. invest. drugs (2000) 9(11)

jain 2721
significantly superior to placebo. times to perceptible
and meaningful pain relief showed similar results. the
times to rescue medication for  xxxd2849xxx , 50 and 100
mg doses, were significantly longer than the other
treatments.
a phase iii, double-blind, placebo-controlled,
randomised study of the efficacy of  xxxd2849xxx  20 mg
iv. and  xxxd2849xxx  40 mg iv. given post-surgically is in
progress for determining the narcotic-sparing
effectiveness in relieving pain following general
surgery. this study will help determine if  xxxd2849xxx 
can be substituted for, or reduce the use of morphine.
5.5.1 clinical

drug safety

a clinical study was conducted to compare the gastroduodenal effects of iv.  xxxd2849xxx , ketorolac and
placebo [13]. the study involved 94 healthy subjects
aged 65 - 75 years, with normal gastrointestinal tracts.
subjects were randomised to receive  xxxd2849xxx 
sodium 40 mg twice a day iv., ketorolac 15 mg four
times a day iv., or placebo for seven days. no gastric
or duodenal ulcers were observed in either the
 xxxd2849xxx  or placebo groups. in contrast, the
ketorolac group had significantly higher rates of
gastroduodenal ulcers and erosions than subjects in
the  xxxd2849xxx  or placebo groups. there were no
clinically or statistically significant differences
between the  xxxd2849xxx  and placebo groups.

6. expert opinion
6.1 method

of assessment and limitation

this opinion is based on the available information,
which is very limited.  xxxd2849xxx  is a prodrug, which is
converted to  xxxd3481xxx .  xxxd3481xxx  is also in clinical
trials as an oral analgesic for the treatment of arthritis.
the clinical trial results of both products have not
been published at the time of writing this article and
only one publication could be retrieved on each of the
products. an assessment of this product is made
against a background of the ideal characteristics of a
post-operative analgesic.  xxxd2849xxx  is compared with
other products in development for post-surgical pain.
methods of evaluating drugs for pain have been
discussed in a separate article [14].
6.2 ideal

post-operative analgesic

the ideal characteristics of an analgesic for the relief
of post-surgical pain are:
© ashley publications ltd. all rights reserved.

• it should be non-narcotic
• it should be potent for relief of pain. ideally the
potency should be comparable with that of
morphine, the strongest analgesic available.
however, the new drugs in development as
non-narcotic analgesics are compared with iv.
ketorolac, currently the strongest non-narcotic
analgesic available for use in this situation
• it should have a rapid onset of action as rapid relief
is required in severe pain
• half-life should be short. in contrast to the
treatment of chronic pain in an ambulatory setting,
the acute pain in the setting of an intensive care or a
recovery room enables repeated administration of
an analgesic as required. short duration of action
enables period and regular monitoring of
neurological status in patients who have
undergone neurosurgical procedures
• titratability should be predictable
• lack of neurotoxicity. it should not have
pro-convulsant or other undesirable effects on the
brain
• it should not have gastrointestinal adverse effects,
such as gastric ulceration, nausea and vomiting.
patients are likely to have post-anaesthetic
vomiting, which should not be aggravated by the
analgesic
• it should not have interactions with anaesthetics
and other drugs given in the post-surgical periods,
such as drugs for relieving nausea and antibiotics to
prevent infection
• parenteral formulation: iv. or im. should be
available for rapidity of action and also because
some patients cannot take oral preparations in the
immediate post-surgery period. intravenous
formulations have an advantage as the rate of
administration can be controlled
it is unlikely that any single drug can fulfil all these
requirements. moreover, specific requirements may
vary according to surgical procedure and there is
room for development of more than one analgesic
compound for relief of post-operative pain.
against this background,  xxxd2849xxx  fulfils some
important requirements such as availability as iv.
formulation, rapidity of action, short half-life and lack
of any significant toxicity.

6.3 comparison

of  xxxd2849xxx  with other
treatments for post-operative pain

6.3.1 comparison

of  xxxd2849xxx  with nsaids

the older nsaids, such as ibuprofen and naproxen,
still remain first-choice drugs for the treatment of
mild-to-moderate pain in dentistry in patients lacking
the contraindications for such drugs. they have not
been replaced by cox-2 inhibitors because their
superiority over nsaids has not been shown in
strictly controlled studies in this setting. an additional
reason is that cox-2 inhibitors are more expensive
and require prescription. however, severe dental pain
associated with dental surgery requires parenteral
analgesics and is a potential market for  xxxd2849xxx .
clinical studies in post-surgical pain associated with
other operations have also shown the efficacy and
safety of  xxxd2849xxx .
one study described in this review has shown that iv.
 xxxd2849xxx  is comparable in efficacy with iv. ketorolac,
but lacks the adverse effects of the latter, such as
reversible platelet dysfunction, demonstrated by a
decrease in maximal platelet aggregation [15].
decrease in platelet aggregation is a cause for concern
in post-surgical patients as it may predispose them to
haemorrhagic complications.  xxxd2849xxx  has not been
shown to have any adverse effect on platelets [16]. no
delay in wound healing has yet been reported in
patients treated with  xxxd2849xxx . nsaid, naproxen,
was shown to significantly decrease collagen deposition at the wound site in a rat model of wound
collagen deposition, whereas cox-2 inhibitor,
celecoxib, had no effect [17].
gastrointestinal side effects, such as abdominal pain,
dyspepsia and diarrhoea, occur as adverse effects of
both nsaids and cox-2 inhibitors. however, shortterm studies show fewer gastrointestinal ulcers in
patients treated with cox-2 inhibitors compared with
traditional nsaids [18]. impairment of renal function
is one of the adverse effects of nsaids and it is
uncertain if cox-2 inhibitors have an advantage over
nsaids in this respect [19].
6.3.2 comparison

still under investigation. it remains to be proven if
they can match the speed of action and control of
administration afforded by iv. injection. intrathecal
drugs will be used in special situations and will have a
limited application due to technical restrictions of the
method of administration, which cannot have such a
wide application as the iv. route.
6.4 conclusions

from the available information, iv. formulation of
 xxxd2849xxx  appears to be a promising drug for the
relief of severe post-surgical pain. it fulfils some of the
desirable characteristics of an ideal analgesic for this
indication and is safe and effective. superiority of
cox-2 inhibitors over nsaids, in terms of adverse
effect profile, has not been established as yet. publication of detailed results of phase iii studies will help in
further assessment of this drug. it has a wider application in the relief of acute pain besides the
post-operative pain and is likely to replace ketorolac,
which is the current standard iv. non-narcotic
analgesic for post-surgical pain.
