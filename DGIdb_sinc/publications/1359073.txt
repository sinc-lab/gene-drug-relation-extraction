abstract- xxxd3016xxx  (n-isopropyl-cc-(2-methylhydrazino)-p-toluamide hydrochloride) inhibited more
powerfully the deamination of  xxxd314xxx  by  xxxd3392xxx -sensitiveamine oxidase (ssao) of rat brown
adipose tissue than the deamination of 5-hydroxytryptamine and  xxxd314xxx  by rat liver monoamine
oxidase-a or -b activities, respectively. inhibition of ssao, but not  xxxg1357xxx , was timedependent. use of metabolic inhibitors, and an enzyme dilution technique, suggested that any conversion of
 xxxd3016xxx  to an active species must be as a result of the action of ssao itself and not of any other
enzyme. the non-competitive kinetics and the time-dependence of inhibition were indicative of a suicide
interaction between  xxxd3016xxx  and ssao. the slow reversal of inhibition by dialysis was evidence in
favour of the involvement of tight binding, rather than covalent bonding. high concentrations of
 xxxd314xxx  afforded the enzyme significant protection from the action of  xxxd3016xxx , indicating that the
interaction is at or near the active site. if the properties of  xxxd3016xxx , evident in in-vitro studies, are
retained in-vivo, these data suggest that  xxxd3016xxx  might be suitable for the examination of ssao
activities, both in-vivo and ex-vivo.

amine oxidase activities, resistant in-vitro to the acetylenic
inhibitors of  xxxg1357xxx  (mao;  xxxg1357xxx .4),but
which are inhibited by carbonyl compounds such as  xxxd3392xxx , have been classified as ec i .4.3.6and are known
collectively as  xxxd3392xxx -sensitive amine oxidase
(ssao) enzymes. existing in both tissue-bound and soluble
forms, these ssao enzymes have, like mao, a wide
distribution throughout the animal kingdom and are also
associated with plants and microorganisms (see callingham
& barrand (1987) for review). however, while their molecular and mechanistic aspects continue to be examined in
some detail (bruinenberg et al 1989; janes & klinman 1991;
hartmann & klinman 1991), a physiological role for most of
these enzymes has yet to be found. this can be attributed, in
the main, to a lack of highly selective inhibitors. such
compounds would allow the modification of ssao activity
without affecting m a 0 and other enzymes sensitive to the
current range of inhibitors of ssao. this would be advantageous particularly in in-vivo studies and in experiments
using isolated organs and tissues where changes in pharmacological responses and metabolite patterns could be compared.
the carcinostatic agent,  xxxd3016xxx  (n-isopropyl-a(2-methyl hydrazino)-p-toluamide hydrochloride) has been
shown to inhibit  xxxd314xxx  oxidation by ssao in homo&nates of various human tissues and of rat lung (lewinsohn
et a1 1978). in an attempt to find a potent, irreversible ssao
inhibitor, which could be used in-vivo, we have examined in
greater detail the effects in-vitro of  xxxd3016xxx  on rat
amhe oxidase activities, using brown adipose tissue (brown
fat) and liver as sources of ssao and mao, respectively
(barrand & callingham 1982).

materials and methods
materials

substrates for the radiochemical amine oxidase assays were
[7-14c]benzylaminehydrochloride, from icn flow (high
wycombe, bucks, uk) and 5-hydro~y[g-~h]tryptamine
creatinine sulphate, from amersham international (amersham, bucks, uk). unlabelled  xxxd314xxx  was obtained as
the free base from sigma chemical co. (poole, dorset, uk)
and crystallized as the hydrochloride in the laboratory.
unlabelled 5-hydroxytryptamine creatinine sulphate was
obtained from sigma. opti-fluor 0 (liquid scintillation fluid)
was obtained from canberra packard (pangbourne, berks,
uk).
 xxxd1730xxx  hydrochloride was a gift from rhbne-poulenc
(eccles, manchester, uk).  xxxd2850xxx  hydrochloride was
purchased from sigma and proadifen hydrochloride (skf
525-a) was a gift from smith kline and french laboratories
(welwyn garden city, herts, uk, now smithkline
beecham, harlow, essex, uk).  xxxd3016xxx , a gift from
hoffmann-la roche (basel, switzerland), was obtained as
the free base and dissolved with an equivalent amount of hc1
in aqueous solution. all other reagents were of analytical
grade where possible. male wistar rats, 200-400 g, were
supplied by a. j. tuck and son (rayleigh, essex, uk).
prepararion of homogenates

rats were killed by stunning followed by decapitation.
livers were excised, washed and stored at -20°c until
required. pads of interscapular brown fat were removed and
placed on ice. a pooled homogenate of brown fat, obtained
from a minimum of 3 animals, was made (1 in 40 w/v in 0.2 m
potassium phosphate buffer, ph 7.8) using a mechanical
homogenizer (polytron mark 5, kinematica). the homogenate was stored in 1 ml portions at - 70°c until required.

400 pl) at 37°c for 1 h under oxygen. samples (50 pl) were
assayed for remaining ssao activity by addition of labelled
substrate. as described above.

radiochemical amine oxidase assay
amine oxidase assays were based on the method described
by lyles & callingham (1982). assays, carried out in
triplicate, were set up in ice-cooled disposable glass tubes
containing 25 pl of homogenate, 25 pl of distilled water or
inhibitor in aqueous solution and 50 pl of appropriate
radiolabelled substrate. samples were usually oxygenated
and pre-incubated with inhibitors at 37°c in stoppered tubes
before addition of substrate. following addition of substrate, samples were re-oxygenated and incubated for 10 rnin
(5 min in kinetic experiments) at 37°c. enzyme activity was
terminated by plunging the tubes into ice and adding hci
(3 m, 10 pl) to each. blanks had hci added before
incubation with substrate. deaminated metabolites were
extracted into 0.7 ml ethyl acetate/toluene (1:l v/v, saturated with water) and 0.4 ml of the organic phase was
counted in 4 ml of opti-fluor 0 for radioactive metabolites,
with quench correction by external standardization in a
scintillation spectrometer (packard model 2500 tr). substrates used were, for ssao, [i4c] xxxd314xxx (10 p ~ sp.
,
act. 10 pci pmol- i), for mao-a, [3h]5-hydroxytryptamine
(250 p ~sp., act. 2 pci pmol-i) and for mao-b, [14c] xxxd314xxx  (250 p ~ sp.
, act. 2 pci pmol-i).

dialysis experiments
for dialysis studies, 3 ml of brown fat homogenate (1 :40)
was pre-incubated with 3 ml of distilled water or 10 p~
 xxxd3016xxx  at 37°c for 2 h and then 0.75 ml aliquots of the
resulting samples were dialysed under appropriate conditions (see results) for 6 or 12 h. non-dialysed samples were
also stored at dialysis temperatures. ssao activity in each
sample was then assayed as described above.

inhibitor selectivity and potency
in experiments to determine the selectivity of  xxxd3016xxx 
for ssao over mao, samples were pre-incubated at 37°c
for 3 h with  xxxd3016xxx  or distilled water (controls) before
remaining enzyme activity was assayed by addition of
labelled substrate, as described above. preliminary experiments indicated that, at submaximal concentrations of
 xxxd3016xxx , a pre-incubation period of between 2 and 3 h
was necessary for the amount of inhibition to reach a
plateau.

protection of the active site
the active site of ssao was protected by pre-incubating
homogenate and  xxxd3016xxx  in the presence of unlabelled
 xxxd314xxx . brown fat (1 :40, 500 pl) was pre-incubated
under oxygen at 37°c for 1 h, with distilled water (500 pl),
 xxxd314xxx  ( i 00 p ~ 500
, pl),  xxxd3016xxx  (2 pm, 500 pl)
or 500 pl of an aqueous solution containing  xxxd3016xxx 
(2 p ~and
)  xxxd314xxx  (100 p ~ )tubes
.
were placed on ice,
4 m l of 1 mm potassium phosphate buffer (ph 7.8) was
added and the samples centrifuged at 1500g for 15 min (mse
chilspin). the supernatants were discarded and the pellets
resuspended in 5 ml of buffer. centrifugation and resuspension were repeated twice and the pellets were finally resuspended in 600 pl of buffer. remaining ssao activity was
assayed in 50 p l aliquots of each sample as described above.
protein assays
protein contents of homogenates were measured by the
method of lowry et a1 (1951) and enzyme activities are
expressed as nmol of product formed h-i (mg protein)-'.
statistical analysis
values are expressed as the mean+s.e.m. sigmoid curves
were fitted to the data, when appropriate, using the nonlinear
regression facility of graphpad inplot, version 3.0 (graphpad software, san diego, ca, usa).

tion of the pre-incubation time with  xxxd3016xxx  to 30 min
resulted in a tenfold loss of potency against ssao, with little
change in the inhibition of mao-a o r -b (results not shown).
in either case, a considerable degree of selectivity for ssao
over both forms of m a 0 is evident. preliminary experiments
had shown that no inhibition of ssao occurred in samples
which were not pre-incubated. this dependence of the degree
of inhibition on time of pre-incubation suggested that
conversion of  xxxd3016xxx  to an active species might be
necessary before inhibition of ssao could occur.
the role of metabolic enzymes in the formation of an active
species
the primary metabolite of  xxxd3016xxx  circulating in the
plasma of both rats and human subjects is azoprocarbazine
(n-isopropyl-a-(2-methylazo)-p-toluamide)
(baggiolini et a1
1969; see tweedie et a1 1987 for review) and the conversion of
 xxxd3016xxx  to azoprocarbazine is brought about by m a 0
or cytochrome p450 (coomes & prough 1983). brown fat is
known to contain m a 0 (barrand & callingham 1982) and,
although cytochrome p450 has not been detected (sekhar et
a1 1990), some isozymes are present in the white fat (drago et
a1 1982; zyirek et a1 1987) that contaminates the interscapular fat pad. therefore, inhibitors of these enzymes were
used to prevent the formation of azoprocarbazine and
subsequent metabolites. tissue homogenates were pre-incubated with  xxxd1730xxx , proadifen o r a mixture of both
compounds, before pre-incubation with  xxxd3016xxx . fig. 2

m a 0 and cytochrome p450 had no effect on the degree of
inhibition produced by  xxxd3016xxx . neither  xxxd1730xxx  nor
proadifen had any effect on ssao activity at the concentraused.

enzyme activities are shown together with values for controls and
for samples pre-incubated with  xxxd3016xxx  only. each value is the
mean of 2 determinations, each in triplicate, on homogenates of
pooled tissues.

enzyme responsible for the conversion of  xxxd3016xxx  to an
active species might be present. the rate of formation of an
active inhibitor would be reduced if a more dilute homogenate containing less activating enzyme was used. to examine
this possibility, homogenates of brown fat (1 :40and 1 :200
w/v) were pretreated with  xxxd1730xxx  and proadifen before
incubation with a submaximal concentration of  xxxd3016xxx  (2 p ~for) 1 h. remaining ssao activity was determined
and expressed as a percentage of activity in control samples
pre-incubated without  xxxd3016xxx . mean values from 2
experiments assayed in triplicate were 5.1 and 6.0% for the
1 :40 and 1 :200 homogenates, respectively. the level of
inhibition produced from 2 pm  xxxd3016xxx  in a 1:200
homogenate would be expected to approximate to that
produced from 0.4 pm  xxxd3016xxx  in a 1 :40 homogenate.
however, no difference was seen between samples of either
homogenate, suggesting that any activation of  xxxd3016xxx 
is likely to be due to ssao itself.
eflect of  xxxd3016xxx  on kinetic constants for (14c] xxxd314xxx  deamination
assays of [14c] xxxd314xxx  metabolism (2-20 pm) were
carried out in the presence of 1 p~  xxxd3016xxx , both after
pre-incubation for 90 min and without pre-incubation. a
parallel experiment used water in place of inhibitor, with no
pre-incubation. fig. 3 shows a hanes-woolf plot of the
results. the common intercept on the abscissa is indicative of
a non-competitive interaction between  xxxd3016xxx  and
ssao. the inhibition obtained in homogenates without any
pre-incubation can be attributed to interaction between
 xxxd3016xxx  and the enzyme during the incubation with
substrate for 10 min for the assay of enzyme activity.

following dialysis for 24 h a t 3 7 t , ssao activity had
returned to 77%ofthecontrol level (result not shown). these
results indicate that, even at 37"c, inhibition of ssao by
 xxxd3016xxx  is only slowly reversible by dialysis.

protecting the active site with excess substrate
in an attempt to determine whether or not inhibition of
ssao by  xxxd3016xxx  is due to an interaction at the active
site of the enzyme, tissue homogenates were pre-incubated
with  xxxd3016xxx  in the presence or absence of a high
concentration of unlabelled  xxxd314xxx . after removal of
 xxxd314xxx  and unbound  xxxd3016xxx , remaining enzyme
activity was determined and the results expressed as percentages of the activities in control samples pre-incubated
without  xxxd3016xxx . mean values from 2 experiments,
assayed in triplicate, were 26.7% ( xxxd3016xxx  alone) and

in the present study, we have examined the effects of the
benzylhydrazine derivative,  xxxd3016xxx  o n rat amine oxidase activities in-vitro. this follows the observation by
lewinsohn et a1 (1978) that  xxxd3016xxx  showed greater
potency against various human and rat ssao activities than
did a number of established ssao inhibitors, with ic50
values lying in the high nanomolar range. perhaps this was
not surprising since hydrazine derivatives generally rank
among the most potent of inhibitors of ssao enzymes (see
lyles 1984 for review) and any search for a novel, selective
ssao inhibitor might begin within this extensive family of
compounds. however, we chose to examine  xxxd3016xxx 
more thoroughly because, although most hydrazine derivatives are too toxic for clinical use,  xxxd3016xxx  is employed
in high doses, both in the treatment of hodgkin's lymphoma
(bonadonna et a1 1969) and of cns tumours in children (van
eys et a1 1985).
following preliminary experiments which established that
a pre-incubation period of between 2 and 3 h was necessary
for  xxxd3016xxx  to reach full potency against ssao, we
have demonstrated that inhibition is dose-dependent and
exhibits an ic50 against ssao of rat brown fat of 210 nm. a
comparison with ic50 values for inhibition of rat liver m a 0
activities shows a degree of selectivity for ssao of some 4
orders of magnitude, particularly with respect to mao-b.
should this also be the case in-vivo, then it may be possible to
inhibit ssao activity fully, without affecting mao. agents
such as phenelzine have been shown to possess similar
selectivity in-vitro; however, in in-vivo experiments, substantial inhibition of m a 0 occurs (andree & clarke 1982).
furthermore, it is possible that clinical doses of  xxxd3016xxx , which are reported to inhibit m a 0 (de vita et a1 19651,

 xxxd3016xxx  and ssao

\krill also cause complete inhibition of ssao enzymes. the
possible consequences of such inhibition for the whole
animal or patient remain unclear.
the observation that a decrease in potency against ssao
was seen when pre-incubation time was reduced suggests that
conversion of  xxxd3016xxx  to an active metabolite takes
place. no change in potency against m a 0 was seen.
however, it is likely that inhibition of biogenic amine
metabolism by m a 0 in-vivo occurs because  xxxd3016xxx  is
itselfa substrate for this enzyme (coomes & prough 1983). in
these experiments therefore, the duration of pre-incubation
would not be expected to alter the degree of inhibition unless
substantial metabolism of  xxxd3016xxx  occurred during preincubation before addition of radiolabelled substrate. the
product of  xxxd3016xxx  metabolism by mao, and by
cytochrome p450, is azoprocarbazine and the possibility that
this compound might be the putative active species was
investigated by employing the metabolic inhibitors,  xxxd1730xxx  (johnston 1968) and proadifen (cooper et a1 1954).
concentrations of these inhibitors sufficient to abolish the
activity of either group of enzymes had no effect on the
potency of  xxxd3016xxx  against ssao, suggesting that
suicide (mechanism-based) inhibition of ssao might be
responsible. however, it was first necessary to rule out the
involvement of some other converting enzyme.
under normal circumstances, the degree of inhibition of
an enzyme by an inhibitor is dependent upon inhibitor
concentration but remains independent of the enzyme
concentration. this is not the case when the inhibition of
mao-a in rat heart by  xxxd1730xxx  is considered, since the
number of  xxxd1730xxx  molecules required to produce complete inhibition approximates to the number of active sites of
the enzyme in the sample used (fowler & callingham 1979).
 xxxd3016xxx  does not fall into this category, since we have
examined other compounds which display much greater
potency against rat brown fat ssao than does  xxxd3016xxx 
(holt et al 1992). therefore, by diluting the homogenate
containing the ssao enzyme and consequently any converting enzyme by the same degree, the concentration of active
metabolite should be reduced and this should be mirrored in
the resultant degree of inhibition of ssao. experiments
based on this principle were unable to show any effect due to
dilution and it would appear, therefore, that  xxxd3016xxx  is
a suicide inhibitor of ssao in-vitro.
kinetic experiments showed the interaction between
ssao and  xxxd3016xxx  to be non-competitive in nature. it
is thought that hydrazine derivatives can interact with a
qrbonyl group on the cofactor, perhaps resulting in the
formation of a diimide (suva & abeles 1978), and it is
probable that  xxxd3016xxx  acts in a similar fashion. our
results suggest that in the first instance, affinity of procarbatine for the enzyme is low. however, an initial interaction
with the cofactor could result in formation of an inhibitormfactor complex. dialysis techniques, used to examine the
nature of the binding involved, indicated that the adduct
formed was not stable and therefore that tight binding,
rather than a pure covalent interaction, probably occurred.
nevertheless, the resistance of this adduct to dialysis means
that  xxxd3016xxx  can be considered irreversible for most invitro experiments. potent, irreversible inhibitors of ssao
are already available, such as (e)-2-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-

49 1

3-fluoroallylamine (mdl 72145) (lyles et a1 1987) and
hydralazine (lyles 1984). however, the former also inhibits
mao-b (zreika et a1 1984) and the latter is relatively nonselective in its effects (baker et a1 1985).  xxxd3016xxx , unlike
hydralazine, is also a relatively stable compound in aqueous
solution and chemical degradation is sufficiently slow that
solutions can be used up to a week after preparation, if stored
at 4°c. it is possible, however, that hydracarbazine (6hydrazino-3-pyridazine carboxamide), an antihypertensive
agent closely related to  xxxd3016xxx  and hydralazine, could
combine the desirable properties of both these compounds to
become both stable and irreversible. furthermore, the
anticancer agent,  xxxd1796xxx  (5-(3,3-dimethyl-l-triazeno)
imidazole-4-carboxamide) may also behave in a similar
manner.
it is likely that the cofactors of ssao isolated from
various sources are situated at the active sites of these
enzymes (suva & abeles 1978; hartmann & klinman 1990,
1991; janes et a1 1990; janes & klinman 1991). thus the
ability of  xxxd314xxx  to afford substantial protection
against inhibition by  xxxd3016xxx  suggests that, in rat
brown fat, the cofactor is at the active site. it would seem
possible that this protection is the result of schiff s base
formation between  xxxd3016xxx  and  xxxd314xxx . however, not all the protection may be due to this interaction
since the rate of binding of [3h]hydralazine,which does not
contain a carbonyl group, to partially purified rat brown fat
ssao is reduced when incubation is performed in the
presence of  xxxd314xxx  (barrand & callingham 1985).
until recently, much uncertainty surrounded the identity of
the cofactor in ssao enzymes. however, recent evidence
points towards 6-hydroxydopa as the cofactor in ssao from
bovine plasma (janes et a1 1990). the inhibition of this
enzyme by  xxxd3016xxx  has not yet been examined. however, the similarities in ic50 values obtained for  xxxd3016xxx  against rat brown fat ssao in our laboratory and
against ssao enzymes from various human tissues and rat
lung by other workers (lewinsohn et a1 1978), provide
tentative evidence that conservation of the cofactor may
occur between these enzymes.
in patients receiving  xxxd3016xxx , many toxic side effects
have been observed, including nausea, vomiting and immunosuppression (see tweedie et a1 1987). an ability to cross
the blood-brain barrier (oliverio et a1 1964) means that
central neurotoxicity is not uncommon and this has been
attributed, at least in part, to the competitive inhibition of
m a 0 (andree & clarke 1982;pfefferbaum et a1 1989). since
the drug is used widely in children, it is particularly
important to prevent such unpleasant psychotic disturbances
and to this end, a low tyramine diet is often given for the
duration of the treatment (pfefferbaum et al 1989). recently,
elliott et a1 (1989), using the isolated perfused mesenteric
arterial bed of the rat, have shown that inhibition of either
mao-a or ssao alone had no effect on the pressor
response to tyramine. however, when both enzymes were
inhibited together, significant increases were seen both in the
maximum pressure attained and in the area under the curve
of the response to low and high doses of the amine. similar
results have also been obtained when tryptamine was applied
to rat aorta preparations in-vitro (taneja & lyles 1988).
such a situation might arise after administration of procar-

andrew holt et al

bazine in clinical doses. while this is not necessarily the case
in-vivo, it is important to remember that other enzymes
besides m a 0 might contribute to these side effects. for
instance, hydralazine is known to affect several enzymes
involved with the turnover of biogenic amines, such as
dopamine-p-hydroxylase (liu et a1 1974) and it would be
surprising if  xxxd3016xxx  did not have some effect on other
such enzymes.
any attempt to explain the neurotoxic disturbances in
patients receiving  xxxd3016xxx  is complicated further by the
possible involvement of methylamine. this endogenous
amine is known to be a substrate for ssao, both in-vitro
(precious et a1 1988; lyles et a1 1990) and perhaps in-vivo
(lyles & mcdougall 1989). cytotoxic actions of methylamine have been demonstrated on cultured neurones and
fibroblasts (gilad & gilad 1986). in uraemic patients, raised
plasma methylamine levels may contribute to neurological
disorders seen in these subjects (simenhoff 1975; baba et a1
1984). the administration of  xxxd3392xxx  or hydralazine
to rats enhances the daily urinary excretion of methylamine
(lyles & mcdougall 1989) and [i4c]methylaminehas been
recovered from the urine of rats treated with [14c] xxxd3016xxx  (schwartz 1966). these results suggest that, in rats at
least, blood levels of this neurotoxic amine might rise after
 xxxd3016xxx  administration, both because metabolism of
endogenous methylamine is prevented and because methylamine is itself a metabolite of the drug.
while n o natural substrate and consequently no physiological role has been identified for most ssao enzymes,
some evidence exists for an involvement in tissue growth and
renewal (pierce et a1 1990). human plasma ssao activity is
known to be reduced in conditions of rapid tissue growth
such as in patients with severe burns or with solid tumours
(lewinsohn 1984).this might be due to many factors but, in
sheep, plasma ssao activity is known to be susceptible to
hormonal regulation (elliott et a1 1991). thus the possibility
exists that hormones released from certain tumours could
influence the activity of ssao enzymes. the use of an
anticancer agent which is also a powerful inhibitor of ssao
enzymes might therefore have unforeseen consequences. the
present findings suggest that  xxxd3016xxx , through its
relatively selective inhibition of ssao activities, may well
prove useful in the search for the physiological role played by
these enzymes.
