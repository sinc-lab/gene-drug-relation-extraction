abstract
ph is one of the key parameters
that affect the stability and function of proteins. we
have studied the effect of ph on the pyridoxal-5ⴕphosphate-dependent enzyme  xxxg1856xxx  produced by the facultative alkaliphile
bacillus circulans ssp. alkalophilus using thermodynamic and crystallographic analysis. enzymatic activity assay showed that the enzyme has maximum
activity at ph 9.0 and relative activity less than 10%
at ph 7.0. differential scanning calorimetry and
circular dichroism experiments revealed variations
in the stability and denaturation proﬁles of the
enzyme at different phs. most importantly, release
of pyridoxal-5ⴕ-phosphate and protein thermal denaturation were found to occur simultaneously at ph
6.0 in contrast to ph 8.5 where denaturation preceded cofactor’s release by approximately 3°c. to
correlate the observed differences in thermal denaturation with structural features, the crystal structure of  xxxg1856xxx  was determined at 1.2 and 1.5 å resolution at two different
phs (8.5 and 4.6, respectively). analysis of the two
structures revealed changes in the vicinity of the
active site and in surface residues. a conformational change in a loop involved in substrate binding at the entrance of the active site has been
identiﬁed upon ph change. moreover, the number of
intramolecular ion pairs was found reduced in the
ph 4.6 structure. taken together, the presented
kinetics, thermal denaturation, and crystallographic
data demonstrate a potential role of the active site
in unfolding and suggest that subtle but structurally signiﬁcant conformational rearrangements are
involved in the stability and integrity of  xxxg1856xxx  in response to ph changes.

introduction
protein stability and activity are affected by various
parameters, such as temperature, salinity, and ph. detailed understanding of the effect of each of these factors
on protein function is necessary for the successful use of
proteins in industrial and biotechnological processes.1
although much is known about the adaptation of proteins
to elevated temperatures and salinity, similar studies on
the effect of ph are limited.  xxxg1856xxx  is a plp-dependent enzyme that catalyzes the reversible
amino group transfer from l-glutamate to 3-phosphohydroxypyruvate to form 2-oxoglutarate and  xxxd1857xxx , respectively (fig. 1). this reaction is the second step of the
“phosphorylated pathway” responsible for the biosynthesis of
2,3
l-serine,
a key source of one-carbon units in the living cells.
psat is a member of the large ␣-family of plp-dependent
enzymes that consists of four subgroups (i–iv4). psat
together with serine isopenicillin-n-epimerase and the  xxxg1562xxx 
gene product belong to the subgroup iv characterized by low
sequence identity with members of any other subgroup of
aminotransferases. furthermore, plp-dependent enzymes
have been classiﬁed into ﬁve fold types based on sequence
and structural considerations.5  xxxg1856xxx  belongs to type i fold along with the other ␣-family

members of plp-dependent enzymes despite the low sequence identity. aspartate aminotransferase is the best
structurally characterized representative of type i fold.
the crystal structure of psat from escherichia coli (ec
psat) and that from the obligate alkaliphile bacillus
alcalophilus (balc psat) have been determined to 2.3 å
(pdb accession code 1bjn6) and 1.08 å resolution (pdb
accession code 1w237), respectively. balc psat has the
same overall architecture with ec psat that consists of a
homodimer characterized by a two-domain fold per subunit. a central seven-stranded ␤-sheet conserved among
all aminotransferases is present in each subunit of psats.
ec psat exhibits a ph-dependent activity proﬁle with a
broad maximum between ph 7.5 and 8.5.8 in contrast, the
enzymatic activity of balc psat was found to exhibit a
ph optimum at ph 9.7 structural comparison of balc
psat with ec psat showed a number of distinct features
in balc psat that may explain the enzyme’s adaptation
to alkaline ph. similar features were also identiﬁed in
 xxxg1856xxx  from bacillus circulans
ssp. alkalophilus, a facultative alkaliphile able to grow at
phs up to 10.9
investigation of the folding and stability mechanisms
among members of the same structural family could
uncover new determinants in the structure and function of
proteins, especially in cases where signiﬁcant sequence
variations occur.10 furthermore, the role of the cofactor
plp in structural stabilization has been reported to vary
among different plp-dependent enzymes.11,12 here, we
have studied bacillus circulans ssp. alkalophilus  xxxg1856xxx  (bcir psat) to better understand its function and stability in response to ph. this is
the ﬁrst report on the unfolding of a subgroup iv representative. thermal denaturation measurements were performed to establish the role of ph in the stability of the
enzyme. in addition, structural analysis of bcir psat to
high resolution was performed. these studies were facilitated by the availability of two crystal forms of bcir psat
grown at ph 8.5 and 4.6, respectively. finally, the effect of
ph on the plp cofactor was investigated.
materials and methods
protein puriﬁcation
the pbcir psat plasmid encoding psat from b.
circulans ssp. alkalophilus (swissprot accession code
q59196) was expressed in e. coli strain xl1-blue. the

recombinant protein is a mutant that contains a glutamate
instead of a lysine residue at position 3. the protein was
expressed in bacteria by standard procedures. the cells
were then pelleted by centrifugation and resuspended in
25 mm tris-hcl ph 8, 100 ␮m plp, 1 mm dtt, 1 mm
pmsf, and 5 mm edta followed by sonication and
centrifugation at 20,000g. the supernatant was loaded
onto a deae cl-6b column (1.5 ⫻ 12 cm, econo-pac,
biorad) equilibrated with 25 mm tris-hcl ph 7.5. after
extensive washing, proteins were eluted with a linear
gradient of 0.1– 0.4 m nacl. fractions containing psat
activity were pooled, dialyzed against 50 mm tris-hcl ph
7.5, and loaded onto an ax 300 hplc anion-exchange
column (25 ⫻ 0.46 cm, eprogen, darien, il) equilibrated
with 50 mm tris-hcl ph 7.5, 50 mm nacl, and 0.01%
␤- xxxd26xxx . after washing with 0.2 m nacl in 50
mm tris-hcl ph 7.5, protein was eluted with 0.5 m nacl
in 50 mm tris-hcl ph 7.5. fractions containing ⬎0.5
mg/ml psat were pooled and concentrated using amicon
centriprep (ym-30) ﬁlters. sephacryl s-200 size-exclusion
chromatography was performed with 50 mm tris-hcl ph
7.5 containing 0.15 m nacl (column dimensions 100 ⫻ 1.5
cm, biorad). after gel ﬁltration, the protein was concentrated to ⬃20 mg/ml.
enzyme activity measurements
the enzymatic activity of bcir psat in the direction of
 xxxd1857xxx  biosynthesis at different ph values was
assayed by the uv method.13 brieﬂy, the enzyme reaction
at 25°c was coupled with glutamate dehydrogenase and
the decrease of nadph absorption at 340 nm was monitored in a recording spectrophotometer. the assay mixture
(1 ml) contained 8 mm  xxxd2431xxx , 32 mm ammonium acetate, 100 mm appropriate buffer (ph range
6.0 – 8.5, hepes; ph 8.5–10.0, chess), 0.18 mm nadph,
20 ␮m plp, 12 u glutamate dehydrogenase (sorachim), and 0.5 ␮g of enzyme. the reaction was started
with the addition of 0.5 mm phosphohydroxypyruvate and
monitored for 10 min. the ph of the mixture was measured at the end of the reaction and the recorded ph was
used for the calculations. km values for glutamate and
phosphohydroxypyruvate were obtained by varying the
concentration of one substrate in the presence of saturating concentrations of the other. km and vmax values were
derived from lineweaver-burk plots.

cd spectroscopy
cd measurements were conducted using a jasco-715
spectropolarimeter with a peltier type cell holder for
temperature control. wavelength scans in the far (190 –
260 nm) and the near (260 –340 nm) uv regions were
performed in quartz suprasil (hellma) precision
cells of 0.1- and 1-cm path length, respectively. each
spectrum was obtained by averaging ﬁve to eight successive accumulations with a wavelength step of 0.2 nm at a
rate of 20 nm min⫺1, response time 1 s, and band width 1
nm. buffer spectra were accumulated and subtracted from
the sample scans. the absorption spectra were recorded by
selecting the uv (single) mode of the instrument. cd
experiments involving thermal scanning at heating rates
of 1.5 k/min have been performed in the range from 20° to
90°c, at 208 and 222 nm in order to continuously monitor
structural changes in bcir psat secondary structure.
thermal cd scans have also been performed at 340 and
415 nm to monitor the dissociation of plp during the
denaturation process at ph 8.5 and 6.0, respectively.
analysis of the spectra was done using the cdnn program.14,15
dsc
high-sensitivity calorimetric measurements were performed on a vp dsc calorimeter (microcal, northampton,
ma).16 protein concentrations used in the dsc studies
varied between 1.2 and 2.6 mg/ml. protein samples and
buffer reference solutions were properly degassed under
vacuum and constant stirring for a period of 20 min. they
were then carefully loaded into the calorimeter cells to
avoid bubble formation. four to ﬁve reference scans with
buffer-ﬁlled cells (sample and reference cell volume was
0.523 ml) preceded each sample run in order to account
for the cell’s thermal history and achieve near perfect
baseline repeatability. a typical dsc experiment consisted of a heating scan at a programmed heating rate (u)
of 1.5 k/min followed by a second heating scan to probe the
reversibility of the thermal transitions. whenever needed,
the difference in the heat capacity between the initial and
ﬁnal states was modeled by a sigmoidal chemical baseline.17
crystallization
bcir psat was crystallized by the hanging-drop vapordiffusion method in two conditions. crystals were obtained
at 22°c after optimization of a previously described protocol18 using 0.1 m sodium acetate buffer, ph 4.6, 4% (w/v)
peg 20000, and 5% (v/v) glycerol. these crystals (form a)
belong to the monoclinic space group c2 with unit cell
parameters 91.3 ⫻ 91.1 ⫻ 42.4 å (␤ ⫽ 111.3°) and a
monomer in the crystallographic asymmetric unit. a second crystal form was obtained at 16°c using 0.1 m
tris-hcl buffer, ph 8.5, 0.2 m sodium acetate, and 30%
(w/v) peg 4000. optimization with addition of 8% (v/v)
glycerol resulted in well-diffracting crystals (form b) that
belong to the orthorhombic space group p212121 with unit
cell parameters 44.8 ⫻ 90.5 ⫻ 157.8 å and one dimer in the
crystallographic asymmetric unit.

x-ray data collection, structure determination,
and quality of the models
complete data sets for both crystal forms were collected from single crystals at the embl x11 beamline at
the doris storage ring, desy, hamburg. crystals were
ﬂash-cooled to 100 k using 15% glycerol as cryoprotectant for both crystal forms. diffraction data were
recorded on a 165-mm mar ccd detector. complete
data sets to 1.5 and 1.2 å resolution were collected from
crystal forms a and b, respectively. the data were
integrated, merged, and scaled using the hkl program
suite.19 the truncate program20 was used to convert
intensities to amplitudes. the ﬁnal statistics for the
data collection are shown in table i. in both cases,
initial phases were obtained by molecular replacement
with amore.21 for crystal form a, the structure of bcir
psat at 2.3 å (pdb accession code 1bt4) without plp
and water molecules was used as a search model. for
crystal form b, a transformation matrix based on the ec
psat dimer structure was applied to locate the second
molecule in the crystallographic asymmetric unit of
bcir psat. a subset of the total number of reﬂections
(5%) was randomly selected and set aside for crossvalidation analysis to monitor the progress of reﬁnement using the rfree factor.22 the structures were
reﬁned initially using cns v.1.123 and shelx-9724 at
the later stages. the models were visualized with the
programs o25 and xtalview.26 the crystal form b data
set is complete up to 1.5 å resolution (overall completeness 96%). inclusion of data to 1.2 å resolution data
decreased the overall completeness to 86%. nevertheless, because the resulting map was of superior quality,
the resolution was extended from 1.5 to 1.2 å in 0.1 å
steps. multiple conformations for several side-chains
were taken into account and modeled. anisotropic reﬁnement of temperature factors for all nonhydrogen atoms
of crystal form b model remarkably improved the electron density map and resulted in a decrease of rcryst and
rfree values by 1.3% and 3%, respectively. in the case of
crystal form a, anisotropic reﬁnement of temperature
factors was applied for n, s, o, and p atoms and resulted
in a decrease of rcryst and rfree values by 2% and 0.5%,
respectively. the working and reference sets were
merged only in the ﬁnal reﬁnement run. the quality of
the models was checked using procheck.27 the rmsd
from ideal geometry and luzzati plots were calculated
using shelx.24 lsqman28 was used for structural
superposition and calculation of rmsd for particular
loops. hydrogen bonds were assessed by contact20
using angle instruction and 3.3 å distance limit.
secondary structure elements were analyzed with
dssp.29 structure-based alignment was performed using the protein structure comparison server ssm30 at
the european bioinformatics institute (http://www.ebi.ac.uc/msd-srv/ssm) and was inspected on graphics. for
the analysis of the dimer interface, the protein-protein
interaction server (ppis) was used.31

results and discussion
ph optimum
bcir psat was ﬁrst studied to establish whether its
enzymatic function is ph dependent. the enzymatic activity of bcir psat in the direction of  xxxd1857xxx  synthesis was measured at various phs using saturated concentrations of substrates. bcir psat shows a bell-shaped
activity proﬁle with a maximum at ph 9.0 (fig. 2). at ph
9.5, the enzyme retains 60% of its maximum activity.
however, the enzyme activity is lost rapidly upon ph
change with no activity observed below ph 6.0. the
apparent km values for glutamate and phosphohydroxypyruvate at ph 9.0 were 0.20 and 0.09 mm, respectively
(table ii). ph lowering clearly affects the binding of
l-glutamate to bcir psat with km increased to 1.0 mm
at ph 7.0. the effect on 3-phosphohydroxypyruvate binding is less dramatic with only a small (⬃10%) increase of
km (km ⫽ 0.1 mm). the intracellular ph of alkaliphilic
bacillus species growing at ph around 11 has been shown
to deviate by two full ph units from the environmental
ph.32,33 the ph optimum obtained for bcir psat ap-

various phs, thermal unfolding experiments were performed. first, cd was used to study the heat-induced
denaturation of bcir psat at ph values 6.0, 8.5, and
10.0. at lower phs, the enzyme formed aggregates that
prevented the recording of the cd spectra. the pi of bcir
psat is ⬃4.55,7 thus explaining the formation of aggregates at low phs. in the native state (room temperature),
the far-uv cd spectra for all three phs are identical [fig.
3(a)]. analysis of the spectra reveals 34.6 ⫾ 1.0% ␣-helical
content and 14.2 ⫾ 1.4% ␤-sheets. however, in the denatured stage, the far-uv cd spectra at various phs show
distinct differences especially between alkaline and acidic
phs [fig. 3(b)] suggesting that the denatured states are
structurally different from each other. indeed, the spectrum at ph 6.0 is indicative of extended structural changes
occurring during thermal denaturation. analysis of the
denatured spectrum at 80°c temperature shows an approximately 50% loss in the ␣-helical content with respect
to the native. however, the spectra at ph 8.5 and 10.0
demonstrate that the denatured bcir psat molecule
retains an adequate amount of the native’s secondary
structure. however, the two spectra are not similar,
suggesting that the two denatured states have structural
differences as well. to exclude the possibility of kinetic
contamination of the denatured spectra, cd data were
collected for the ph 6.0 sample at t ⫽ 75°c and t ⫽ 80°c
after an incubation period of approximately 1 h. the two
spectra were identical indicating minimal kinetic effects.
analogously, cd data for the high ph samples have been
obtained at temperatures 70°, 80°, and 90 °c after 1-h
incubation periods at each temperature. kinetic contamination has been minimal for these samples as well.
for all phs, the plp molecule dissociates from the
denatured bcir psat molecule. this is clearly demonstrated by cd difference spectra (fig. 4). indeed, because
unbound plp is optically inactive, the resultant difference
(nature-denatured) spectra show the characteristic positive bands at either around 345 nm or around 415 nm
depending on the protonation state of plp.7,34,35
dsc
further characterization of the thermal denaturation of
bcir psat was performed by using high-precision dsc.
as in the case of the cd experiments, the calorimetric data
demonstrate substantial differences in psat’s behavior
between alkaline and acidic environments. the dsc cp
(heat capacity under constant pressure) versus t proﬁles
obtained at various ph conditions are presented in figure
5. at ph 6.0 and protein concentration (ct) of 1.2 mg/ml,

the thermally denatured state of bcir psat at various phs: ph 6, 80°c
(solid line); ph 8.5, 90°c (dashed line), and ph 10, 90°c (dotted line). the
spectra have been obtained after 1-h incubation period at each temperature.

the thermal unfolding is described by a sharp cp peak with
a tm (temperature at maximum cp) of 71°c for heating
scan rate of 1.5 k/min. the thermal transition is irreversible, possibly because of aggregation phenomena in the
denatured state (visible aggregates can be observed in the
denatured state). a complete thermodynamic analysis of
the unfolding is thus not possible because the dsc proﬁles
may well be kinetically contaminated. nevertheless, the
calorimetric enthalpy change (⌬h) associated with the
unfolding can be calculated from the cp versus t trace. at
ph 6.0, ⌬h is 288 ⫾ 27 kcal/mol, which corresponds to
0.80 ⫾ 0.07 kcal/mol-residue. this result is in good agreement with the ﬁndings concerning globular proteins of
approximately the same size with bcir psat undergoing

the dsc proﬁles are considerably different in alkaline
phs. at ph 8.5, tm is 58.4°c (for scan rate 1.5 k/min, ct 1.2
mg/ml), almost 13° lower than the corresponding tm at
ph 6.0. the dsc trace at ph 10.0 is similar to that at ph
8.5 with a tm of 58°c (scan rate 1.5 k/min, ct ⫽ 1.1
mg/ml). moreover, the cp peaks at high ph are broader
than the ones at ph 6.0. this, in turn, is indicative of a less
cooperative transition at high ph. at a ﬁrst glance, it

would appear that in the acidic environment the bcir
psat molecule acquires more thermostability. the situation is more complex though. the enthalpic content of the
cp peaks at phs 8.5 and 10.0 is 121 ⫾ 11 and 124 ⫾ 11
kcal/mol, respectively, or approximately 0.34 kcal/molresidue. this accounts for only half of the enthalpy change
measured at ph 6.0 and is clearly smaller than that
expected for a complete thermal denaturation to an unstructured ﬁnal state. moreover, aggregation phenomena
in the denatured states at the alkaline phs are considerably milder than those observed at ph 6.0. thus, bcir
psat may follow a different unfolding pathway depending
on the ph conditions. one possible explanation might
concern the role of plp. indeed, from the cd experiments
it has become evident that plp dissociates from the
denatured bcir psat molecule. the plp dissociation
could therefore contribute to the observed ct-dependence
of tm in the calorimetric results (fig. 5). however, if only
the dissociation of the plps was to take place, the experi-

mental values of the tm shifts with increasing ct would
have been larger than the observed ones.37 this is indicative that both cofactor and dimer dissociation take place
during the denaturation process. thus, the heat-induced
denaturation could be best described by the following
model37:
n 2(plp) 2 3 2d ⫹ 2plp

(1)

where n is the native and d the denatured state of bcir
psat.
it is interesting at this point to investigate the kinetics
of the thermal unfolding of bcir psat as unveiled by
thermal cd scans at heating rates of 1.5 k/min. figure 6
displays the fractional population of bcir psat molecules in the denatured state as a function of temperature

derived by i) the cd signal at 222 nm versus t, depicting
the changes in the helical structures of the native state,
and ii) the cd signal at 415 nm versus t, depicting the
dissociation of plp molecules from bcir psat. at ph 6.0
[fig. 6(a)], the two processes are remarkably synchronous.
in contrast, at ph 8.5 [fig. 6(b)], changes in the secondary
structure clearly precede (by almost 3°c) the dissociation
of plp. at ph 10.0 (data not shown), only a small (less
than 1°c) temperature interval separates the signals at
the two wavelengths.
based on the calorimetric and spectroscopic results, it
seems that at ph 8.5 the dissociation of plp from bcir
psat takes place once the changes in the secondary
structure have considerably progressed. the molecule
destabilizes into a substantially structured monomeric
state, which remains stable for up to higher temperatures
(90°c). such behavior is likely pointing toward a multistep
denaturation process, which includes denatured intermediate states containing plp. in fact, this has also been
observed during chemical denaturation experiments of the
dimeric mitochondrial aspartate aminotransferase
(maat).34 a common unfolding mechanism between members of the same structural family but with low sequence
homology is not unusual and has been suggested before for
the ␣-family of aminotransferases.10 however, a different

750

e.g. kapetaniou et al.

altogether scenario occurs at ph 6. here, thermally induced changes in the secondary structure are not observed
until higher temperatures. interestingly, these changes
occur simultaneously with the release of plp and the
cooperative destabilization of bcir psat into unstructured monomers. the latter are characterized by high
propensity for aggregation. finally, at ph 10.0, where
bcir psat is biologically inactive, a denaturation process
to a stable unfolding intermediate state is likely, almost
simultaneously with the release of plp and the dissociation of the homodimer. the proposed scenario at ph 10
appears therefore to combine elements of both the ph 6.0
and ph 8.5 unfolding processes. it is, however, striking
that release of plp is slightly postponed at ph 8.5 which is
close to the ph of optimum activity. at ph 6.0 and 10.0,
bcir psat enzymatic activity is diminished suggesting
that changes affecting active site’s functionality may well
contribute to the plp release and the kinetics of the
unfolding.
crystallographic analysis and quality of the
structures
in an attempt to explain the differences observed in
bcir psat enzymatic activity and thermal denaturation
at different phs, a detailed analysis of the crystal structure of the enzyme was performed. two different crystal
forms (a, ph 4.6; b, ph 8.5) were grown. based on the
enzymatic activity measurements, bcir psat at ph 4.6
has no activity. in contrast, at ph 8.5, bcir psat retains
approximately 80% of its maximum activity. both structures were reﬁned to high resolution (1.5 å, ph 4.6; 1.2 å,
ph 8.5) with good stereochemistry. the ﬁnal model at ph
4.6 comprises 360 amino acid residues, 1 plp molecule, 1
glycerol molecule, and 340 water molecules. the ﬁnal
model from form b crystals contains a homodimer in the
crystallographic asymmetric unit with a total of 722
residues, 2 plp molecules, and 809 water molecules. table
i shows the ﬁnal reﬁnement statistics for the atomic
models of bcir psat. description and analysis of the
bcir psat structure is based on the ph 8.5 model (fig. 7).
subunit a will be used throughout the remainder of the
discussion except where noted otherwise. bcir psat
model at ph 4.6 will be used for comparison studies.
structural differences upon ph change
form a and form b psat monomers were compared to
identify structural differences as a result of the different
ph used in crystallization. least-squares superposition
yielded an rmsd of 0.5 å for 357 c␣ positions. the
secondary structure is almost identical with limited
changes between the two forms as suggested also by the
cd analysis of the native structure. the program escet38 was used to identify conformational ﬂexible regions
of the protein by comparing the two structures. the
analysis was based on 352 residues. of them, 9.4% were
categorized as ﬂexible (2– 4, 90 –92, 133–143, 197–201,
306 –309, 310 –312, 327–334, 359 –362) (fig. 8). signiﬁcant
changes in the ﬂexible loop 133–143 (rmsd 2.7 å), which
is situated close to the domain’s interface, and in the loop
proteins: structure, function, and bioinformatics

327–334 (rmsd 2.3 å) which harbors two substratebinding residues (his328 and arg329) were found. his328
and arg329 of the small domain of the same subunit and
his42 and arg43 of the large domain of the second subunit
are fully conserved residues in all psat structures. these
residues are oriented in two pairs and opposite to each
other in the active site. in addition, they have been
suggested to interact with the substrate in the ec psat
structure in complex with ␣-methyl-l-glutamate.6 at ph
8.5, loop 328 –333 moves toward the entrance of the
substrate-binding pocket (fig. 9). furthermore, his328 is
tilted ⬃30° compared with its plane at ph 4.6. notably, the
b-factors for the 328 –333 loop are higher than those at the
ph 4.6 structure suggesting some ﬂexibility that could
possibly facilitate substrate binding at alkaline ph. the
distribution of the b-factors for the main- and side-chain
atoms is shown in figure 8(b, c).
analysis of the dimer interface for the ph 8.5 structure
with the protein-protein interaction server (ppis31,39)
showed that approximately 15% of the solvent-accessible
surface area of each subunit (2315 å2) is buried upon
dimer formation. an approximately similar surface area
(2207 å2) is buried in form a bcir psat dimer. interactions between the two monomers in form b calculated by
contact20 are quite extensive and include 159 hydrophobic contacts (cut-off distance 5.0 å) and 44 polar contacts
(cut-off distance 3.8 å), of which 26 correspond to hydrogen
bonds and two hydrogen-bound ion pairs between arg4
and glu39 in each subunit. the number of intersubunit
interactions is the same as in the bcir psat model at ph
4.6.7 thus, the dimer interface seems not to be affected by
the ph changes.
the total number of intramolecular interactions per
monomer in the two structures is similar. however, small
variations in the distances were found that may contribute
to the stability proﬁle at different phs. a signiﬁcant
difference between the two structures was found regarding
the number of ion pairs. the structure at ph 8.5 exhibits
16 ion pairs compared with 11 found in the ph 4.6
structure (table iii). as the number of ion pairs seems to
be inﬂuenced by the ph, the additional ion pairs at ph 8.5
may contribute to the different behavior of bcir psat at
alkaline ph. moreover, the fact that at ph 8.5 the protein
molecule still retains a structured state before the release
of plp also points to a potential role of the intramolecular
interactions. detailed analysis of the ion pairs reveals
interesting features. three of the 11 ion pairs found in the
ph 4.6 model are not present in the ph 8.5 model. in
contrast, a higher proportion of ion pairs (8 of 16) are found
in the ph 8.5 but not in the ph 4.6 structure. the
glu18-arg258 ion pair is located near the hinge region
connecting the small and large domains of the monomer.
as such, the orientation of the two domains may be
disrupted more easily in the ph 4.6 structure, thus contributing to the collapse of the molecule. the region 134 –142
that undergoes a large movement during transition from
low to high ph could also have a role to maintain the
domain orientation at high ph. this loop is located close to
the domain’s interface and is better deﬁned at the ph 8.5

structure. the presence of factors that stabilize the domains or domain– domain interactions may affect the
kinetics of the bcir psat unfolding. for large proteins,
the existence of several folding domains/subunits often
results in multiple unfolding paths.40 from the remainder
of the ion pairs, it is worthy to mention the strong
interaction (2.49 å) in the large domain between glu53
and lys253 at ph 8.5 from neighboring helices ␣2 and ␣6,
respectively. this interaction may again have a role in the
stability of the large domain and subsequently the unfolding pathway.
active site
close inspection of the active site was performed to
analyze changes in the chemical environment of plp
between the two structures. the two active sites in the
bcir psat dimer are located at the dimer interface [fig.
7(a)]. plp is connected to lys197 through a schiff base.
table iv shows the hydrogen-bond interactions between
plp and active site atoms in crystal forms a and b of bcir
psat. further contacts include aromatic stacking interactions between the pyridine ring of the cofactor and the
indole ring of trp103 (⬃3.6 å separation distance) on the
re-face of plp, and van der waals interactions with the
side-chains of ala77 and ser175 on the si-face. moreover,
the pyridine nitrogen atom (n1) makes a strong contact
(2.7 å) with od2 atom of asp173, a residue strictly
conserved in the aminotransferase superfamily. rotation
of asp173 side-chain is prevented by hydrogen bonds with
the main-chain n and og of ser173 and a water-mediated
contact with thr149. no changes were observed in the
orientation of the plp aromatic ring upon ph change,
hence the interactions of the cofactor are remarkably
conserved regardless of the ph.

the o3⬘ atom of the cofactor forms a hydrogen bond with
og1 of thr153. no similar interaction has been observed
in the unligated ec psat. it was therefore suggested that
thr153 og1 may contribute to the increased pka of the
imine nitrogen of the schiff base in balc and bcir
psats.7 the pka for bcir psat imine nitrogen is ⬃9.0,
hence at lower phs is expected to be protonated. the
protonation state of the imine nitrogen may also have a
role in the release of plp during thermal unfolding. in
fact, the differences observed at ph 6.0 and 8.5 could be
related to the activity proﬁle of the enzyme. however, at
ph 10.0, the plp release occurs in a manner similar to
that at ph 6.0 but in a nonsynchronous mode reminiscent
of that at ph 8.5. it is therefore possible that other factors
could inﬂuence the release of plp but at this stage it is
difﬁcult to speculate. nevertheless, the presence of intermediate stages during the thermal release of plp at a ph
close to the ph optimum for enzymatic activity imposes an
interesting question for further experiments. in other
words, the recorded differences seem to suggest a possible
dependence on the cofactor of the unfolding kinetics and
the formation of unfolded species. similar suggestions
have been put forward for aat.41
as mentioned above, the loop 328 –333 moves closer to
the entrance of the active site at ph 8.5 (fig. 9). in its new
position, it seems to reduce the accessibility of the solvent
to the active site. moreover, arg329 from being highly
ﬂexible at ph 4.6 becomes ordered at ph 8.5 and able to
interact with water molecules at the vicinity of the active
site. it is thus possible that bcir psat arg329 may have
a stabilizing role for the active site through a water
network. in support of the stabilizing effect of the 328 –333
loop, stability studies in cu, zn superoxide dismutase have
shown that higher ﬂexibility and solvent accessibility in
the active site result in ph sensitivity in the e. coli
enzyme.42 finally, this loop may also serve for the better
binding of substrate in alkaline environments close to the
ph optimum of bcir psat as deduced by the km values
obtained in the kinetic assays.

the region 199 –202 was found to be conformationally
ﬂexible. indeed, the conformation of this region is signiﬁcantly different between the two subunits and adopts an
alternate geometry in subunit a. interestingly, this region
is located near the active site, diametrically opposite to
328 –333 with plp being in the center. residues 200 and
201 are gly and pro, respectively. isomerization of pro
residues has been associated with slow folding phases.43
because of their proximity to the active site, residues
199 –202 may also affect the kinetics of plp release during
thermal unfolding.
conclusions
crystallographic and thermal unfolding studies were
performed to characterize the stability and denaturation
proﬁle of psat from the facultative alkaliphile b. circulans ssp. alkalophilus in response to ph changes. kinetic
analysis clearly established a maximum enzymatic activity at ph 9.0 and no activity below ph 6.0. thermal
unfolding analysis revealed a major difference between
phs 6.0, 8.5, and 10.0 concerning the release of the plp
cofactor from the thermally unfolded protein molecule.
this release was found to occur either synchronously or
asynchronously with the thermally induced changes in the
secondary structure. high-resolution crystal structure analysis showed subtle changes between bcir psat structures at ph 4.6 and 8.5, respectively. a conformational
change of a loop at the entrance of the active site was
identiﬁed that may be responsible for the enhanced substrate binding at ph 8.5. additional regions at the surface
of the protein were also found to adopt different conformations at the two phs and may well affect the unfolding
proﬁle as revealed by thermal denaturation experiments.
two prominent ion-pair interactions not present in the low
ph structure were identiﬁed in the ph 8.5 structure that
may contribute to domain stabilization within the psat
monomer. no major changes were found for plp as a
result of the ph changes. thus, the release of plp might
be affected by conformational rearrangements in the vicinity of the active site or distantly from it. further experiments could shed light on the mechanism and the exact
role of ph in the unfolding of psat whereas mutagenesis
studies could establish a more precise role of various
residues in the stability of the enzyme. in addition, the ph
analysis presented here may form the basis to experiments
for a better understanding of the role of plp in the
stabilization of psat or other plp-dependent enzyme.
moreover, comparative studies between alkaliphilic and
neutrophilic psats may also provide further insights into
ph stability.
