1 vascular smooth muscle cell (vsmc) chemotaxis is fundamental to atherosclerosis and intimal
hyperplasia. an increase in intracellular ca2 þ [ca2 þ ]i is an important signal in chemotaxis, but the
role of l-type calcium channels ( xxxg304xxx ) in this response in human vascular smooth muscle cells
(hvsmc) has not been examined.
2 hvsmc were grown from explant cultures of saphenous vein. confluent hvsmc at passage
3 were studied after culture in medium containing 15% foetal calf serum (fcs) (randomly cycling)
or following serum deprivation for up to 7 days. smooth muscle a-actin was measured by
immunoblotting and immunofluorescence microscopy. [ca2 þ ]i was measured using fura 2 fluorimetry.
chemotaxis was measured using a modified boyden chamber technique and cell attachment to gelatincoated plates was also quantified. the number and affinity of dihydropyridine-binding sites was
assessed using [5-methyl-3h] xxxd2405xxx -110 binding.
3 in randomly cycling cells, the calcium channel agonist, bay k 8644a and 100 mm kcl did not
affect [ca2 þ ]i. in addition, the rise in [ca2 þ ]i induced by platelet-derived growth factor-bb (pdgf)
was unaffected by the  xxxg304xxx  antagonists, amlodipine and verapamil. in randomly cycling cells
amlodipine did not affect pdgf-induced migration.
4 in serum-deprived cells, smooth muscle a-actin was increased and bay k 8644a and 100 mm kcl
increased [ca2 þ ]i. pdgf-induced rises in [ca2 þ ]i were also inhibited by amlodipine and verapamil.
the ability of bay k 8644a to increase [ca2 þ ]i and verapamil to inhibit pdgf-induced rises in [ca2 þ ]i
was evident within 3 days after serum withdrawal. in serum-deprived hvsmc bay k 8644a induced
chemotaxis and amlodipine inhibited pdgf-induced migration. cell attachment in the presence of
pdgf was unaffected by amlodipine in either randomly cycling or serum-deprived hvsmc.
5 serum withdrawal was associated with a decrease in the maximum number of dihydropyridinebinding sites (bmax) and a decrease in affinity (kd).
6 serum deprivation of hvsmc results in increased expression of smooth muscle a-actin, a marker
of more differentiated status, and increased [ca2 þ ]i responses and chemotaxis mediated by  xxxg304xxx .
these observations may have important implications for understanding the therapeutic benefits of
calcium channel antagonists in cardiovascular disease.

introduction
vascular smooth muscle cells (vsmc) are responsible for the
regulation of vascular tone and also participate in vascular
responses to injury. studies in animals indicate that following
damage vsmc undergo dedifferentiation from a quiescent,
‘contractile’ state to a ‘synthetic’ phenotype (campbell &
chamley-campbell, 1981) and migrate into the region of
injury, where they contribute to intimal hyperplasia (ross,
1993). smooth muscle cells in atherosclerotic plaques or
intimal hyperplastic lesions more resemble dedifferentiated
myofibroblasts, or cultured vsmc (chamley-campbell et al.,

*author for correspondence; e-mail: a.hughes@imperial.ac.uk

1979; thyberg, 1996) than native contractile smooth muscle
cells. in cellular terms, the transition from contractile to
synthetic phenotype is characterised by reduced expression of a
variety of proteins, including contractile proteins, such as
smooth muscle a-actin (owens, 1995). synthetic cells have
limited ability to contract and become more responsive to
chemotactic and mitogenic factors (ross, 1993). in culture,
dedifferentiation of smooth muscle cells has been reported to
be partially, though not fully, reversible by prolonged
withdrawal of growth factors or serum (chamley-campbell
et al., 1979; chamley-campbell & campbell, 1981). changes
in intracellular ca2 þ ([ca2 þ ]i) are important in the process of
cell migration (pettit & fay, 1998). in contractile vsmc

l-type calcium channels ( xxxg304xxx ) are a major route of entry
for ca2 þ ions (hughes, 1995). calcium antagonists, such as
dihydropyridines and phenylalkylamines, block  xxxg304xxx  and
consequently their potential role in inhibiting atherosclerosis
has attracted much interest. calcium channel antagonists have
been shown to inhibit smooth muscle cell migration (nakao
et al., 1983) and also inhibit formation of atherosclerosis
in some animal models (nomoto et al., 1987; jackson et al.,
1989). however, evidence in favour of a specific antiatherosclerotic effect in man is less convincing (borhani et al., 1996;
pitt et al., 2000; zanchetti, 2001; hernandez et al., 2003). one
possible explanation for this could be that  xxxg304xxx  do not play
such an important role in chemotaxis in human vascular
smooth muscle cells (hvsmc) as in some other species. this
study, therefore, examined the role of  xxxg304xxx  in [ca2 þ ]i
responses and chemotaxis in hvsmc.

methods
materials
cell culture plastics, media, foetal calf serum (fcs), supplements and recombinant human pdgf were obtained
from lifetechnologies (paisley, u.k.). pn200-110, ( þ )[methyl-3h] (2948.9gbq mmol1) and polycarbonate filters
were purchased from nen life science products (boston,
ma, u.s.a.), and poretics (livermore, ca, u.s.a.) respectively. bovine  xxxg124xxx  (bsa) fraction v was obtained
from roche diagnostics (lewes, u.k.). glass coverslips of
13 mm diameter and methanol were purchased from merck
(poole, u.k.). monoclonal anti-human smooth muscle a-actin
(clone 1a4) (skalli et al., 1986), secondary antibodies and
normal rabbit serum were purchased from dako ltd (ely,
u.k.). normal mouse immunoglobulins were obtained from
r & d systems europe (abingdon, u.k.). nitrocellulose and
the enhanced chemiluminescence kit were purchased from
amersham pharmacia biotech (high wycombe, u.k.) and
acrylamide and scintillant obtained from national diagnostics
(hull, u.k). amlodipine was a gift from pfizer u.s. all other
reagents were purchased from sigma (poole, u.k.).

cell culture
explant cultures of human vsmc were grown from saphenous vein as described previously (chan et al., 1993).
redundant veins were obtained from patients undergoing
cardiovascular surgery in accordance with the guidelines of the
local ethics committee. vsmc cultures were established in
dulbecco’s modification of eagle’s medium (dmem) buffered with 25 mm hepes and supplemented with 15% (v v1)
fcs 4 mm l-alanyl-l-glutamine (glutamax-i), penicillin
(100 u ml1), streptomycin (100 mg ml1) and gentamicin
(25 mg ml1). hvsmc cultures were maintained in a humidified atmosphere of 5% co2 (v v1) in air at 371c and
characterised by positive immunostaining for smooth muscle
a-actin and lack of staining for  xxxg2423xxx . in this
study, confluent vsmc were employed at the third passage for
all the experiments, either in a randomly cycling or quiescent
state (following up to 7 days of serum deprivation and
maintenance in nctc 109 medium supplemented with 25 mm
hepes, 4 mm, glutamax-i, 0.25% (w v1) bsa fraction v

(2.5 mg ml1) and antibiotics). these conditions were used to
induce maximal quiescence as we have previously reported that
hvsmc remain viable and do not undergo significant
apoptosis following serum withdrawal for up to 7 days (unlu
et al., 2001). cell cycle analysis of hvsmc by flow cytometry
using  xxxd3027xxx  revealed that the percentages of cells
in the s and g0/g1 phases, respectively, were 12.370.5 and
74.070.9% in the presence of serum, and 2.670.5 and
90.970.6% after 24 h serum deprivation in nctc 109
medium.

measurement of [ca2 þ ]i
[ca2 þ ]i was measured following loading of hvsmc with 5 mm
fura-2am (90 min, 371c) as described previously (clunn et al.,
1997a). after loading, cells were washed, briefly trypsinised,
centrifuged and resuspended in physiological saline comprising
(mm): nacl 127, kcl 5.9, mgcl2 1.2, cacl2 1, glucose 14 and
hepes 10.6, adjusted to ph 7.2 with naoh. fluorescence
was measured using excitation wavelengths of 340 and 380 nm
with emission at 510 nm using a deltascan spectrofluorimeter
(pti). experiments were calibrated and [ca2 þ ]i concentration
calculated using 50 mm digitonin to permeabilise the cells. all
experiments were performed at 371c.

cell migration
chemotaxis assays were conducted using blind well chemotaxis chambers (neuroprobe, cabin john, md, u.s.a.) as
described previously (clunn et al., 1997b). briefly, vsmc were
trypsinised and suspended in standard growth medium
supplemented with 15% fcs. the resultant cell suspension
was centrifuged (200  g, 10 min) and resuspended in serumfree dmem supplemented with 0.1% (w v1) bsa fraction v.
cell viability was assessed using trypan blue dye exclusion and
a cell suspension prepared at a density of 2.25  105 viable
cells ml1.
the upper and lower compartments of the blind well
chambers were separated by 13 mm gelatin-coated polycarbonate filters with 8 mm pores. the chemoattractant (0.3 ml,
pdgf 2 ng ml1) was added to the lower compartment and
cell suspension (0.4 ml, 2.25  105 cells ml1) added to the
upper chamber. cells in suspension were either pretreated with
amlodipine or serum-free dmem (30 min, 371c) prior to
transfer into the upper chamber. the migration assay was
allowed to proceed for 5 h in the presence or absence of
inhibitor at 371c in a humidified atmosphere of 5% co2 in
air. assays were terminated by washing the cells twice in
dulbecco’s phosphate-buffered saline without calcium and
magnesium (pbs-a) and fixing the cells in  xxxd102xxx  at
room temperature (10 min). the polycarbonate filters were
stained in a 65 mm toluidine blue solution (15 min) and the
cells on the upper side of the filter gently scraped off, leaving
the migrated cells on the underside of the filters for counting.
the cells present in four fields of view (  200 magnification)
were counted on duplicate filters.

cell attachment
cell adhesion was assessed using a modification of the method
described by bilato et al. (1997). briefly, gelatin-coated 96-well
plates were prepared by coating overnight with 50 mg ml1

m.k. patel et al

gelatin at 41c and blocked with 5 mg ml1 denatured bsa (1 h,
371c). a cell suspension was prepared at a density of 2  105
viable cells ml1 and 100 ml aliquots of cell suspension added to
the wells in triplicate and maintained in a humidified atmosphere of 5% co2 in air (5 h, 371c). the optimal cell density
and time course for cell adhesion were determined in
preliminary experiments (data not shown). all subsequent
steps were conducted at ambient temperature. nonadherent
vsmc were removed by washing twice with pbs-a and
adherent cells fixed with 4% formaldehyde in pbs-a. the
fixative was removed and the cells stained with 1% (w v1)
toluidine blue in 4% (v v1) formaldehyde for 15 min. the
wells were extensively rinsed with water and the stain eluted
from the attached cells using 1% (w v1) sodium dodecyl
sulphate solution. cell attachment was quantified by the dye
adsorption which was determined spectrophotometrically at
630 nm using a microplate reader.

dihydropyridine binding
the binding of [5-methyl-3h]- xxxd2405xxx -110 to human vsmc
was conducted according to the method of navarro (1987).
briefly, vsmc were plated into 24-well plates at a density
of 105 cells ml1 (1 ml well1) in standard growth medium
supplemented with 15% fcs and allowed to attach overnight.
one set of the 24-well plates was used to conduct a binding
assay on randomly cycling cells, while cells in the remaining
24-well plates were rendered quiescent (as described earlier) for
up to 7 days.
prior to conducting the binding assays, the hvsmc were
washed twice with pre-warmed serum-free dmem. cell
counts were obtained in triplicate by treatment of the hvsmc
with trypsin (0.25% in 1 mm edta in pbs-a) in order to
normalise the ligand binding with respect to cell number.
[5-methyl-3h]- xxxd2405xxx -110 was prepared in serum-free dmem
to provide a range of final concentrations (10 pm–10 nm).
assays were performed under dim light in triplicate wells
(30 min, 371c) and terminated by removing the ligand and
washing the cells three times (5 min each wash) with ice-cold
wash buffer comprising 0.9% (w v1)  xxxd3213xxx , 5%
(v v1) dimethyl sulphoxide and 1% (w v1) bsa (ph 7.0).
nonspecific binding was determined by incubation under the
same conditions with excess unlabelled  xxxd2737xxx  (10 mm).
cells were solubilised with 1 m sodium hydroxide solution and
aliquots of the cell lysates transferred to scintillation vials to
which ecoscint was added. radioactivity was measured in a
1900ca tricarb liquid scintillation counter (canberra packard, pangbourne, u.k.) to determine the amount of [3h]-pn
200-110 bound to the cells.
hvsmc were plated at a density of 2  104 cells well1
onto sterile 13 mm diameter glass coverslips that had been
placed in 24-well plates. after overnight attachment, randomly
cycling cells were washed twice with pbs-a and fixed with
ice-cold methanol (10 min). parallel cultures were rendered
quiescent (as described above) by maintenance in supplemented nctc 109 growth medium and fixed as described
above.
immunocytochemical studies were conducted at ambient
temperatures. fixed cells were hydrated by incubation in pbsa (10 min) and blocked with 10% (v v1) normal rabbit serum
in pbs-a for 20 min to reduce nonspecific staining. cells were
incubated with either a-actin antibody (skalli et al., 1986)

(1/25) or normal mouse immunoglobulins at the same igg1
concentration for 1 h and extensively washed in pbs-a
containing 0.1% v v1 tween 20. secondary antibody (1/15)
was applied for 1 h in pbs-a containing 10% normal rabbit
serum and the cells thoroughly washed in pbs-a containing
0.1% (v v1) tween 20. the coverslips were mounted in
citifluor mountant and viewed on a carl zeiss axiophot
microscope under epifluorescence. photographs were taken
using kodak elitechrome 400asa film.

immunoblotting studies
proteins were separated on 10% sds-polyacrylamide gels
prior to transfer to nitrocellulose using a bio-rad wet gel
transfer system as described previously (patel et al., 2002).
following successful transfer, nitrocellulose blots were blocked
using 5% bsa (w v1) in tris-buffered saline containing 0.05%
tween 20 (ttbs) for 1 h and washed thoroughly in ttbs
prior to probing with primary antibody for 1 h. blots were
probed with the appropriate secondary antibody prepared in
ttbs containing 3% bsa, washed three times in ttbs and
developed using the enhanced chemiluminescence kit.

statistics and data analysis
all data are presented as means7s.e.m. of n observations.
radioligand-binding data were fitted to a logistic function by
nonlinear regression using prism 3.03 (graphpad software,
san diego, ca, u.s.a.) to calculate the maximum binding site
number (bmax) and binding affinity (kd). statistical comparisons were made with instat 3.05 (graphpad software, san
diego, ca, u.s.a.) using a repeated-measures anova
followed by dunnett’s multiple comparison test, or by a
student’s paired t-test as appropriate. po0.05 was considered
significant.

results
serum withdrawal for 7 days resulted in increased levels of
smooth muscle a-actin measured by immunoblotting and
immunofluorescence microscopy (figure 1). the effect of 7
days serum deprivation was also examined on changes in
[ca2 þ ]i due to  xxxg304xxx  in hvsmc. the calcium channel
agonist bay k 8644a (100 nm) or 100 mm kcl had no effect on
[ca2 þ ]i in randomly cycling human vsmc (n ¼ 3; data not
shown). however, following serum deprivation for 7 days
100 mm kcl (data not shown) or bay k 8644a increased
[ca2 þ ]i (figure 2a) and this effect was inhibited by amlodipine
(3 mm), an inhibitor of  xxxg304xxx  (figure 2a). in serum-deprived
vsmc, pre-incubation with amlodipine (3 mm) also inhibited
the rise in [ca2 þ ]i following application of pdgf (10ng ml1)
(figure 2b). the effect of amlodipine was more marked on the
later sustained rise in [ca2 þ ]i measured 2 min after the initial
response to pdgf than the early rise in [ca2 þ ]i measured
at 30 s (figure 3a). in contrast, in randomly cycling cells
amlodipine (3 mm) had no effect on the rise in [ca2 þ ]i, although
nicl2 (2 mm), a nonselective blocker of ca2 þ entry was able to
partially inhibit the response to pdgf (figure 3b).
the time course of appearance of  xxxg304xxx  was examined in
more detail in subsequent studies using bay k 8644a (100 nm)
and another  xxxg304xxx  inhibitor, verapamil (10 mm). responses

to bay k 8644a (100 nm) increased progressively over a 4-day
period (figure 4) and by day 3 following serum withdrawal
verapamil significantly inhibited the rise in [ca2 þ ]i induced by
pdgf (10 ng ml1) (figure 4).
in order to assess the functional significance of these
observations, we examined the effect of bay k 8644a alone,
and amlodipine on pdgf-induced chemotaxis of both
randomly cycling hvsmc and hvsmc rendered quiescent
by serum withdrawal for 7 days. in randomly cycling hvsmc,
bay k 8644a (100 nm) had no effect on chemotaxis and
amlodipine (10 mm) did not affect migration in response to
pdgf (2 ng ml1), but the nonselective voltage-operated and
receptor-operated channel blocker nicl2 (2 mm) reduced
pdgf-induced
chemotaxis to nonstimulated levels
(figure 5a).
in contrast, following serum deprivation bay k 8644a
(100 nm) increased chemotaxis to 156730% of control (n ¼ 3;
p ¼ 0.05), and amlodipine (10 mm) also significantly inhibited
pdgf-induced chemotaxis (figure 5a). since the migration of
cells through the pores in the filters in the modified boyden
chamber involves the process of attachment as well as directed
movement of cells, we examined the effect of amlodipine on
attachment to the gelatin-coated filters to establish which
process involved  xxxg304xxx . pdgf-induced attachment was
unaffected by amlodipine (10 mm) in either randomly cycling
or quiescent human vsmc (figure 5b), suggesting that

inhibition of  xxxg304xxx  reduced cell migration rather than
attachment.
in view of the evidence suggesting an increased functional
role of  xxxg304xxx  in [ca2 þ ]i responses and chemotaxis in serumdeprived cells, we examined whether this was due to changes in
the number and/or affinity of dihydropyridine-binding sites.
radioligand-binding studies using [3h]- xxxd2405xxx -110 showed a
significant reduction in the bmax and a progressive decrease in
kd in hvsmc after serum deprivation for 3 or 7 days
(figure 6a) compared with randomly cycling cells.

discussion
in this study, we have examined the role of  xxxg346xxx . 2 channels in
[ca2 þ ]i responses and chemotaxis in randomly cycling and
serum-deprived hvsmc derived from saphenous vein. in
randomly cycling cells cultured in medium containing 15%
fcs depolarisation by kcl or the selective  xxxg304xxx  opener bay
k 8644a had no effect on [ca2 þ ]i and inhibition of  xxxg304xxx 
with amlodipine did not affect migration in response to
pdgf. serum withdrawal caused growth arrest as evidenced
by the reduced number of cells in s phase. in addition,
there was an increase in smooth muscle a-actin expression,
suggesting that serum withdrawal results in some degree of
re-differentiation towards a contractile state as reported
previously (fager et al., 1989). serum deprivation was also
accompanied by evidence of a contribution of  xxxg304xxx  to

[ca2 þ ]i responses and chemotaxis. in the case of [ca2 þ ]i
responses, this was evident after 3–4 days of serum withdrawal.
an action of amlodipine on cell attachment was excluded as
the basis for its inhibitory action on cell migration and this
effect is therefore likely to involve interference with ca2 þ dependent processes involved in migration (nomoto et al.,
1988). the concentrations of amlodipine used in these studies
were quite high, but we have previously reported that the ic50
for amlodipine under nondepolarised conditions is b0.5 mm
(garcha et al., 1993) and consequently high concentrations are
required for effective inhibition of  xxxg304xxx . the absence of an
effect on amlodipine on randomly cycling cells argues against
nonspecific inhibitory effects of these concentrations of
amlodipine. these observations contrast with earlier studies
in animal-derived vsmc in which dihydropyridines and other
calcium channel antagonists have been reported to inhibit
chemotaxis in randomly cycling cells (nomoto et al., 1988;
corsini et al., 1996).
previous studies have reported that cell culture conditions
affect expression of calcium channels. in rat aortic myocytes,
richard et al. (1992) reported that low-voltage-activated
calcium channel currents were expressed transiently, while
cells were proliferating, whereas high-voltage-activated currents were seen in the first 5 days in primary culture and after
the cells had reached confluence. ihara et al. (2002) reported
l-type calcium channels were lost during proliferation and
reappeared following serum deprivation, inhibition of mek,

or once cells had achieved confluence. similarly, kuga et al.
(1996) reported that expression of both l- and t-type currents
in rat aortic myocytes varied between different phases of the
cell cycle with greatest expression of l-type currents in g1
phase and t-type currents in s phase. in human coronary
myocytes, only dihydropyridine-sensitive l-type currents were
seen in freshly isolated myocytes, whereas both l- and t-type
currents were recorded from cells in primary culture (quignard
et al., 1997); the effect of more prolonged culture was not
examined.
surprisingly, in our studies of hvsmc, radioligand-binding
assays showed a decrease in the number and affinity of
dihydropyridine-binding sites following serum withdrawal for
up to 7 days. these data suggest that reduced expression of
a1-subunits of  xxxg304xxx  (which correspond to dihydropyridine
binding sites) does not account for the reduced functional role
of  xxxg304xxx  in randomly cycling hvsmc. this finding contrasts
with a previous study, examining the a7r5 cell line, derived
from rat embryonic thoracic aorta, which reported that
 xxxd3417xxx -induced re-differentiation resulted in increased
calcium channel currents, higher levels of dihydropyridine
binding and increased expression of mrna for a1 calcium
channel subunits (gollasch et al., 1998). while the decrease
in dihydropyridine-binding sites with serum deprivation in
hvsmc was unexpected and remains to be explained, it
should be noted that the number of dihydropyridine-binding

sites does not correspond to functional  xxxg304xxx  in the
membrane. indeed, the number of dihydropyridine-binding
sites generally exceeds the estimated number of functional
 xxxg304xxx  channels by 50–100-fold (schwartz et al., 1985; aiba
& creazzo, 1993). it has been reported that the level of
expression of b subunits is important in regulating membrane
localisation of a1 subunits (perez-garcia et al., 1995; gao
et al., 1999) and further studies exploring the effect of serum
deprivation on calcium channel b (and other accessory)
subunit expression would be of interest in understanding this
issue.
the majority of evidence supporting the use of calcium
antagonists as antiatherosclerotic agents has been based on
animal studies in which these agents reduce the severity of
atherosclerosis, independent of actions on plasma lipids
and blood pressure (paoletti et al., 1995). in humans, however, studies which have examined the action of calcium

l-type ca2+ channels in human vascular smooth muscle cells

figure 6 changes in (a) bmax and (b) kd for the binding of [5methyl-3h]- xxxd2405xxx -110 to human vsmc. radioligand-binding
assays were conducted as described in methods. both bmax and kd
were determined from experiments performed on randomly cycling
vsmc (day 0) and following serum deprivation for 3 and 7 days.
data represent mean7s.e.m. from five separate experiments.

plasia have been less clear cut (borhani et al., 1996;
pitt et al., 2000; zanchetti, 2001; hernandez et al., 2003).
it is possible that this is related to the influence of phenotypic state on  xxxg304xxx  and its function in the migration of
hvsmc.
in summary, this study shows that serum deprivation
increases functional  xxxg304xxx  in hvsmc and that this is
not attributable to a reduction in the number of dihydropyridine-binding sites (i.e. the a1 subunit of  xxxg304xxx ). these
findings may have implications for better understanding the
effects of calcium channel antagonists in human cardiovascular disease.

we are grateful for financial support provided by the british heart
foundation and pfizer international. we thank laura sampson and
karen gallagher for assistance in performing the immunocytochemical studies and maintaining the vsmc cultures, respectively. we also
thank the surgeons and theatre staff at st mary’s hospital for help
with collection of saphenous vein.
