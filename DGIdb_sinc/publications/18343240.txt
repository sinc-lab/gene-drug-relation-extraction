abstract
background:  xxxd2838xxx , formerly known as
 xxxd2838xxx , was the first recombinant human immunoglobulin g2 monoclonal antibody approved by
the us food and drug administration for the treatment
of patients with  xxxg682xxx –
expressing metastatic colorectal cancer (mcrc) refractory to fluoropyrimidine-, oxaliplatin-, and/or
irinotecan-containing chemotherapeutic regimens.
objective: the purpose of this review was to evaluate the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties, clinical efficacy, and safety profile of  xxxd2838xxx  in the treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer.
methods: computerized searches of medline and
international pharmaceutical abstracts from 1985 to
august 15, 2007, were performed with the search terms
 xxxd2838xxx ,  xxxd2838xxx , egfr, and colorectal cancer. all available clinical trials and ongoing trials were
included in this review. relevant abstracts presented at
the annual meetings of the american society of clinical
oncology, american association for cancer research,
and gastrointestinal cancer symposium (1999–2007)
also were reviewed and included.
results: preclinical and clinical studies have established a role for  xxxd2838xxx  in mcrc refractory to
multiple chemotherapeutic regimens. in a phase iii trial
of  xxxd2838xxx  plus best supportive care (bsc) versus
bsc alone in patients with refractory mcrc,  xxxd2838xxx  was found to have efficacy in time-related end
points, such as progression-free survival. in the  xxxd2838xxx  group, a significant (46%) reduction in tumor
progression rate was reported compared with bsc (hazard ratio, 0.54; 95% ci, 0.44–0.66; p < 0.001). at the
14

present time, the use of  xxxd2838xxx  as first-line treatment for mcrc with standard chemotherapy and bevacizumab is not indicated due to increased toxicity with
no advantage in efficacy. the efficacy of  xxxd2838xxx 
is being evaluated in other solid tumors, such as lung,
breast, ovarian, bladder, and head and neck cancers.
conclusion:  xxxd2838xxx  appears to have relatively acceptable tolerability and is now available as an additional option for patients with mcrc refractory to
multiple chemotherapeutic regimens. (clin ther.

introduction
in the united states, it is estimated that 153,760 people will be diagnosed with colorectal carcinoma (crc)
and 52,180 people will die from it in 2007.1 crc is
the third most common type of cancer in both men
and women and accounts for 10% of all cancer-related
deaths in the united states.1 in the past 2 decades,
mortality from crc has declined in both men and
women due to improvements in early detection and
treatment options.1
currently, the standard of care in patients with
metastatic crc (mcrc) consists of a fluoropyrimidine (fluorouracil or  xxxd425xxx ) plus  xxxd2462xxx  in
accepted for publication september 24, 2007.

combination with either oxaliplatin or irinotecan and
bevacizumab (table i).2–4 the combination of fluorouracil and  xxxd2462xxx  to enhance the inhibition of
dna synthesis was the first effective treatment for
mcrc, with an objective response rate of 20% and
median survival of 11 months, an improvement from
6 months’ median survival without treatment.5 in the
past decade, the addition of oxaliplatin or irinotecan
to fluoropyrimidine-based chemotherapy for mcrc
was associated with an objective response rate of 31%
to 56% and a median overall survival of 15 to 21
months. the most recent targets of therapy for mcrc
are the vascular epithelial growth factors (vegfs) and
 xxxg681xxx  receptors (egfrs).5 bevacizumab is a chimeric humanized monoclonal antibody (mab) that targets vegf and has been found to
have benefit as first-line therapy in combination with
fluorouracil,  xxxd2462xxx , and oxaliplatin (folfox)
or irinotecan, fluorouracil, and  xxxd2462xxx  (ifl and
 xxxd467xxx ) for mcrc.6 median survival increased
from 16 to >20 months with the addition of bevacizumab to the standard combination chemotherapeutic regimens.7  xxxd2838xxx  and cetuximab are egfr
inhibitors approved by the us food drug administration (fda) for mcrc refractory to standard chemotherapeutic regimens.2,3,8,9 currently, there are ongoing trials evaluating the role of egfr mab in the
treatment of mcrc.10–13

the purpose of this review was to evaluate the
pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties,
clinical efficacy, and safety profile of  xxxd2838xxx  in
the treatment of mcrc.

background
egfr is a  xxxg1608xxx   xxxg2198xxx  that
is a part of the human  xxxg682xxx  (her) erythroblastosis oncogene b ( xxxg682xxx ) family
of receptors.14 egfr is important for normal organ development through its effects on cellular proliferation,
differentiation, apoptosis, invasion, and angiogenesis.14,15 in normal cells, egfr activation pathways are
under strict control; however, in tumor cells, egfr signaling is often dysregulated, resulting in increased
tumor cell proliferation, invasion of surrounding tis-

indication
 xxxd2838xxx , formerly known as  xxxd2838xxx , was the
first recombinant human immunoglobulin (ig) g2
mab approved—on september 27, 2006—under the
fda accelerated program20 based on the promising results from a phase iii randomized, controlled, clinical
trial.21  xxxd2838xxx  is currently available only in the
united states and is indicated for the treatment with
egfr-expressing mcrc that is refractory to fluoropyrimidine-, oxaliplatin-, and/or irinotecan-containing
chemotherapeutic regimens.8,22 it is dosed at 6 mg/kg
iv infusion q2w.

pharmacology
 xxxg682xxx  (egfr)
egfr is a 170-kda transmembrane protein that is a
member of the her ( xxxg682xxx ) family receptor  xxxg2198xxx . the 4 members of this family include the egfr,
also known as  xxxg682xxx  or  xxxg682xxx -1, her2 (also erbb2/neu),  xxxg722xxx  (also  xxxg722xxx ), and  xxxg723xxx  (also  xxxg682xxx -4).23
the egfr consists of 3 major domains: (1) an extracellular ligand–binding domain; (2) a transmembrane lipophilic region; and (3) a cytoplasmic protein tyrosine
kinase domain with a regulatory carboxyl terminal segment.23,24 at least 6 different ligands that bind to the
egfr have been identified. the  xxxg681xxx  (egf), transforming growth factor (tgf)-alpha,
and  xxxg185xxx  bind only to egfr. heparin-binding
egf,  xxxd2988xxx , and  xxxg727xxx  bind to both the egfr
and  xxxg682xxx -4.23,24 on binding of a ligand to the extracellular domain of egfr on the cell surface, the receptor undergoes dimerization with an identical receptor (homodimerization) or with another receptor
in the her/ xxxg682xxx  family (heterodimerization).23,24
dimerization stimulates  xxxg2198xxx  activity and
triggers autophosphorylation of tyrosine residues in
the carboxyl terminal region of the cytoplasmic
domain of egfr. autophosphorylation of tyrosine
leads to the recruitment and phosphorylation of intracellular signaling molecules involved in the activa16

tion of multiple downstream pathways, resulting in
mitogenesis.23–25
several mechanisms can lead to aberrant egfr signaling in tumor cells. overexpression of wild-type
egfrs that possess ligand-independent receptor activation is found in many cancers. the development of
egfr mutation, which includes point mutation or deletion in the  xxxg2198xxx  activation domain, results in
inappropriate receptor activation. autostimulation of
egfrs by overexpression of the ligand tgf-alpha is due to
an autocrine response.14,26–28
egfr is measured using immunohistochemistry
(ihc) and scored based on the amount of egfr reactivity and staining intensity in the adenocarcinoma
cells. the scoring system is scaled from 0 to 3, where
0–<1 indicates no reactivity, 1–<2 is weak reactivity/
staining intensity, 2–<3 is moderate reactivity/staining
intensity, and 3 is strong and complete reactivity/
staining intensity of tumor cells.29–31
egfr reactivity can also be characterized based on
the mean percentage of egfr-reactive cells in each
adenocarcinoma case.29 break points commonly used
in clinical trials include negative reactivity (<1% of
egfr expression in tumor cells), low reactivity
(1%–<10% egfr expression in tumor cells) or high
reactivity (≥10% egfr expression in tumor cells).32,33
the role of the level of egfr expression in relationship to clinical response to egfr mab has been controversial.34

 xxxd2838xxx  ( xxxd2838xxx )
 xxxd2838xxx  is a fully human igg2 mab that
binds with high affinity (dissociation constant [kd] =
5 × 10–11 m) to the ligand-binding domain of egfr.35
 xxxd2838xxx  competitively blocks the binding of
egf and tgf-alpha to egfr, thus inhibiting autophosphorylation induced by egfr ligands. after binding to
egfr,  xxxd2838xxx  is internalized but not degraded.
the end results of  xxxd2838xxx  binding is internalization of the egfr, inhibition of cell growth, induction of apoptosis, and reduction of proinflammatory
cytokine and vegf production.36  xxxd2838xxx  is
produced by immunizing the xenomouse igg2 strain
with the human cervical epidermal carcinoma cell line
a431, which has high expression of egfrs.37 the
xenomouse strain was engineered to lack functional
mouse immunoglobulin genes, while human heavyand kappa light-chain alleles are substituted.35 this process
reliably produces antigen-specific, high-affinity, fully

human, therapeutic mab.37  xxxd2838xxx  is produced commercially in genetically engineered chinese
hamster ovary cells.8  xxxd2838xxx  contains no
murine protein sequences and is anticipated to be nonimmunogenic, causing fewer hypersensitivity reactions. repeated administration of  xxxd2838xxx  is
possible without eliciting the human antihuman antibody (haha) response.35
in vitro,  xxxd2838xxx  has been found to have
high binding affinity to egfrs, competitively block
binding of the ligands of egf and tgf-alpha to egfr,
and inhibit tyrosine autophosphorylation.35 in a
xenograft model of a431 tumor cell lines, low doses
of single-agent  xxxd2838xxx  was associated with
prevention of tumor formation, lysed existing tumor
cells, and inhibited tumor growth. an evaluation of
the effects of  xxxd2838xxx  on different human solid
tumor cell lines with varying levels of egfr expression in xenograft models found that  xxxd2838xxx 
had no effect on egfr-negative tumors or tumors expressing <11,000 egfrs per cell, whereas tumors expressing >17,000 egfrs per cell were found to have
growth inhibition (stable or minimal tumor size
growth at days 55–65 in  xxxd2838xxx -treated tumors compared with ~0.75–1.75 cm3 tumor growth
in controls).37

pharmacokinetics
 xxxd2838xxx  has been found to have nonlinear pharmacokinetics at doses <2 to 2.5 mg/kg due to saturation of the egfr.8 clearance of  xxxd2838xxx  is
dependent on the presence of egfr, and clearance is
decreased as the dose is increased.30,38 linear pharmacokinetics occurs at doses >2 to 2.5 mg/kg.30,38 at
6 mg/kg q2w, steady state is reached by the third
dose, with a mean (sd) cmax 213 (59) µg/ml, cmin 31
(14) µg/ml, auc0–tau 1306 (374) µg 䡠 d/ml, clearance
4.9 (1.4) µg 䡠 d/ml, and elimination t1/2 7.5 days
(range, 3.6–10.9 days).8 age, sex, race, mild to moderate renal dysfunction, and mild to moderate hepatic
impairment did not seem to affect the pharmacokinetics of  xxxd2838xxx .8
a formal review of the literature did not identify
any published pharmacokinetic studies conducted in
patients with renal or hepatic impairment. use of  xxxd2838xxx  in japanese patients with advanced solid
malignancies did not identify any pharmacokinetic
differences compared with treatment in non-japanese
patients.39

clinical activity
monotherapy for mcrc
phase i studies
in a phase i trial conducted by figlin et al,40 43 patients
with advanced-stage cancer were enrolled to receive up
to 4 weekly infusions of  xxxd2838xxx , with doses
ranging from 0.01 to 2.5 mg/kg qw. tumor types included were prostate cancer (n = 13), renal cancer (n =
10), colorectal cancer (n = 7), non-small cell lung cancer (n = 7), esophageal cancer (n = 3), and pancreatic
cancer (n = 3). no measurement of egfr expression
was specified in the study. one patient with esophageal
cancer and 1 patient with colorectal cancer achieved
stable disease for 7 months at the 0.1-mg/kg dose and
for 4 months at the 1.5-mg/kg dose. one patient with
prostate cancer treated with a dose of 0.75 mg/kg
achieved a minor response lasting 6 months (regression
of 3 or 4 lesions by 38%–76% and decrease in
 xxxg1281xxx  [psa] level by 60%). grade 1,
transient acneiform rash was observed in all patients
receiving at least 1 dose of 2 or 2.5 mg/kg. no other adverse events (aes), allergic reactions, infusion-related
reactions, or haha responses were reported.
a phase i, open-label, dose-escalation trial of  xxxd2838xxx  was conducted in 96 patients with advanced,
solid tumors who had received prior systemic therapy.41 inclusion criteria were acceptable organ function
and at least 1+ egfr expression in ≥10% of tumor
cells (method of assessing egfr expression was not
stated). the mean age of the patients was 60.4 years
(range, 32–79 years), 75% (72/96) were male and
tumor types included colorectal cancer (n = 39),
prostate cancer (n = 21), renal cancer (n = 15), lung
cancer (n = 14), esophageal/gastroesophageal cancer
(n = 3), pancreatic cancer (n = 3), and anal cancer
(n = 1). sequential cohorts of patients received varied
doses and treatment schedules of  xxxd2838xxx . all infusions were administered over 1 hour with no premedications. the dosing schedules were 0.01 to 5 mg/kg iv
qw, 6 mg/kg iv q2w, or 9 mg/kg iv q3w. in this
dose-finding study, 5 (12.8%) patients, all in the crc
group, had confirmed partial response by the world
health organization (who) criteria (table ii).4,42
one patient with prostate cancer achieved minor response by psa measurement, and 18 patients had stable disease. dose-dependent skin-related toxicity
(grade 3/4) was observed in 10% of patients, with a
plateau at doses of ≥2 mg/kg per week. no maximum tolerated dose was reached, and no infusion re17

phase ii studies in refractory mcrc
high egfr expression
a phase ii, multicenter clinical trial of  xxxd2838xxx  as monotherapy was initiated with a planned accrual of 100 patients with mcrc that failed treatment
with fluoropyrimidine plus irinotecan or oxaliplatin
or both.43 patients were eligible if ≥10% of the tumor
cells had egfr overexpression of 2+ or 3+ by ihc.
 xxxd2838xxx  was administered intravenously over
1 hour at a dose of 2.5 mg/kg per week, with no loading dose. response was assessed every 8 weeks using
response evaluation criteria in solid tumors (recist)
(table iii).2,44 in an interim analysis of 23 patients,
the median age was 64 years (range, 39–79 years),
12 patients were male and 11 were female, and all patients had an eastern cooperative oncology group
(ecog) performance status (table iv) of 0 (n = 8) or
1 (n = 15). twenty patients received at least 5 of the first
8 doses of  xxxd2838xxx . three patients withdrew

from the study (2 with progressive disease and 1 with
grade 3 rash, the higher grade indicating more severe
toxicity). three (13%) patients had a partial response,
and their tumor cells had 3+ egfr expression. nine
(39%) patients had stable disease. all patients developed a skin rash (61% with grade 1, 30% with grade
2, 9% with grade 3 skin toxicity). other aes reported were asthenia (n = 8), stomatitis (n = 6), abdominal
pain (n = 2), anorexia (n = 2), conjunctivitis (n = 2) —
all of grade 1/2 severity.43
in a phase ii, multicenter trial,33  xxxd2838xxx 
monotherapy was evaluated in patients with mcrc
who had disease progression despite treatment with
2 or 3 regimens of fluoropyrimidine-, irinotecan-, and
oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy. other inclusion criteria were ecog performance status score 0 to 2, and
egfr staining of ≥10% tumor cells on ihc.  xxxd2838xxx  was dosed at 6 mg/kg q2w until disease progression occurred. primary end points were objective
response rate, response duration, progression-free survival (pfs), and survival time. the secondary end

efficacy and tolerability were evaluated separately.
this trial plans to enroll 300 patients. an interim
analysis in may 2005 included 39 patients eligible for
efficacy evaluation following ≥20 weeks of treatment
and 91 patients available for tolerability analysis after
receiving at least 1 dose of  xxxd2838xxx . at week 16,
3 (8%) patients had partial response, 8 (21%)
achieved disease stabilization, and disease progression
was seen in 19 (49%) patients. nine patients (22%)
were not assessable. at least 1 treatment-related ae

integument toxicities included skin (96%), nail
(30%), chelitis (7%), and hair (5%). eye toxicity occurred in 85% of patients; diarrhea, in 27% (3 with
grade 3); and hypomagnesemia, in 12% (3 with grade
3/4). the specific nature of the skin, nail, hair, and eye
toxicity was not elaborated on by the investigators.
grade 3 hypersensitivity reaction occurred in 1 patient and resolved with treatment; additional doses of
 xxxd2838xxx  were administered with premedication
(names of medication[s] given not stated) without hypersensitivity recurrence. no haha responses were
detected in 66 patients who had paired baseline and
posttreatment serum samples analyzed.

low or negative egfr expression
 xxxd2838xxx  monotherapy was evaluated in a
phase ii study that enrolled 2 cohorts of patients with
mcrc who failed chemotherapeutic regimens containing fluoropyrimidine (with or without  xxxd2462xxx )
plus irinotecan, oxaliplatin, or both.46,47 patient cohorts were determined by levels of egfr expression.
cohort a (n = 105) consisted of patients with 2+ or
january 2008

3+ egfr overexpression in ≥10% of tumor cells.
cohort b (n = 43) included patients with the sum of
1+, 2+, and 3+ egfr staining found in ≥10% of tumor
cells, but with the sum of 2+ and 3+ in <10% of tumor
cells. the method of egfr measurement was not specified. patients received  xxxd2838xxx  at 2.5 mg/kg qw
in 8 weekly cycles until either disease progression or
intolerable aes occurred. end points included tumor
response by recist criteria (table iii), time to disease progression, survival, and tolerability. a total of
148 patients were treated and included in the final assessment (82 men, 66 women; mean age, 59 years
[range, 21–88 years]; ecog performance status 0,
n = 37; ecog performance status 1, n = 111). a partial
response was observed in 10% (15/148) of patients
(cohort a, 10% [11/105]; cohort b, 9% [4/43]).
overall median time to disease progression was 2.5
months (95% ci, 2–4) (cohort a, 3.4 months [95% ci,
2–4]; cohort b, 2.1 months [95% ci, 2–4.5]. overall
median survival time was 9.4 months (95% ci,
6.6–10.6) (cohort a, 10 months [95% ci, 6.2–11]); cohort b, 9.4 months [95% ci, 6–10.6]). although no
statistical analysis was performed to evaluate the differences between low and high egfr-expressing tumors, the response rates, time to disease progression,
and survival time appeared similar irrespective of the
level of egfr expression. skin-related toxicity was
reported in 95% of patients. one grade 3 infusionrelated toxicity was reported, with no dose modification
required. no haha responses were observed.
a phase ii, multicenter, single-arm study assessed response rates in patients with low (1%–9% of tumor cells)

ease progression during or after 2 to 3 regimens of fluoropyrimidine, irinotecan, and oxaliplatin treatment
within 6 months of the most recent administration of
chemotherapy.48  xxxd2838xxx  was given at 6 mg/kg
q2w until disease progression or intolerability. that
study plans to enroll 150 patients. an interim analysis
in 89 patients with ≥20 weeks of follow-up revealed
that 7% (6/89) of all patients had a partial response
(low egfr expression, 8% [4/51]; negative egfr expression, 6% [2/35]). twenty-nine percent (26/89) of
all patients had disease stabilization (low egfr expression, 29% [15/51]; negative egfr expression,
31% [11/35]), and disease control was observed in
37% (33/89) (low egfr expression, 39% [20/51];
negative egfr expression, 37% [13/35]). the median
time to response was 9 weeks overall and in patients
with low and negative egfr expression, with a minimum of 7 weeks and a maximum of 12 weeks. median
duration of response was 20 weeks (range, 8–46 weeks)
overall. the duration of response was longer in patients
with negative egfr expression: 31 weeks (range,
16–46 weeks) compared with 20 weeks (range,
8–20 weeks) in patients with low egfr expression.
median pfs was 8 weeks overall (95% ci, 7–11) (low
egfr expression, 8 weeks [95% ci, 7–13]; negative
egfr expression, 7 weeks [95% ci, 7–14]). the most
common aes reported were dermatitis acneiform
(overall, 72%; grade 3/4, 6%), erythema (overall,
69%; grade 3/4, 6%), pruritus (overall, 65%; grade
3/4, 4%), and hypomagnesemia (all patients, 53%;
grade 3/4, 10%). three patients (<3%) had infusion
reaction (grade 3, 1 patient). these preliminary results
suggest that efficacy of  xxxd2838xxx  may not depend
on the level of egfr expression.

a phase iii, multicenter, randomized trial compared the addition of  xxxd2838xxx  to a regimen of
best supportive care (bsc) versus bsc alone in patients with refractory mcrc and radiologic documentation of disease progression within 6 months of the
most recent administration of a chemotherapeutic regimen containing fluoropyrimidine plus oxaliplatin or
irinotecan. other eligibility criteria were 2 or 3 prior
chemotherapeutic regimens for mcrc, and ≥1%
egfr-positive staining in tumor cells on ihc.21 a
total of 463 patients were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to
1 of 2 treatment arms:  xxxd2838xxx  6 mg/kg q2w
until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity oc20

curred plus bsc, or bsc alone. crossover to the
active-treatment group was allowed in the study for
those whose disease progressed on bsc alone. the
primary end point was pfs. secondary end points
were overall survival (os), overall objective response,
median duration of response, median time to response, and tolerability. patients were followed up
until disease progression (median follow-up, 35 weeks
[range, 15–76 weeks]). in the  xxxd2838xxx  group, a
significant (46%) reduction in tumor progression rate
was reported compared with bsc (hazard ratio [hr],
0.54; 95% ci, 0.44–0.66; p < 0.001). pfs was higher
in the  xxxd2838xxx  + bsc group than the bsc group
throughout the treatment period from weeks 8 to 40.
at week 8, pfs was observed in 49% of the patients
who received  xxxd2838xxx  + bsc versus 30% in
the bsc group. median pfs time was 8 weeks (95%
ci, 7.9–8.4) in the  xxxd2838xxx  + bsc group versus
7.3 weeks (95% ci, 7.1–7.7) in the bsc group. mean
(se) pfs time was 13.8 (0.8) weeks in the  xxxd2838xxx  + bsc group versus 8.5 (0.5) weeks in the bsc
group. baseline patient characteristics, such as age,
performance status, number of metastases, number of
previous treatments, or egfr expression, were not
found to be associated with the effects of  xxxd2838xxx  on pfs. the proportion of patients achieving
partial response was also significantly greater in the
 xxxd2838xxx  + bsc group versus the bsc group
(10% [22] vs 0%; p < 0.001). twenty-seven percent
(62) of patients had disease stabilization in the  xxxd2838xxx  + bsc group compared with 10% (23) of
patients in the bsc group. median time to response was
7.9 weeks (range, 6.7–15.6 weeks) and median duration
of response was 17 weeks (range, 7.9–76.7 weeks) in
the  xxxd2838xxx  group. in the primary analysis of
this trial, difference in os between  xxxd2838xxx  +
bsc versus bsc alone did not reach statistical significance (hr, 1.0; 95% ci, 0.82–1.22). the lack of survival benefit in the  xxxd2838xxx -containing arm
could be explained by a large proportion (76%) of patients crossing over to the  xxxd2838xxx  arm from the
bsc group. when an exploratory analysis excluding
crossover patients was performed, a possible 14% reduction in mortality in the  xxxd2838xxx  + bsc group
versus the bsc group was observed. skin toxicities
were seen in 90% of patients receiving  xxxd2838xxx 
versus 9% in the bsc group. eighty-six percent (19/22)
of responders in the  xxxd2838xxx  group developed
grade 2/3 skin rash, and the remaining 3 (14%) develvolume 30 number 1

oped grade 1 skin rash. patients in this study who had
more severe (grade 2–4) skin toxicity had improvements in pfs (hr, 0.62; 95% ci, 0.44–0.88) and os
(hr, 0.59; 95% ci, 0.42–0.85) versus patients with
mild (grade 1) toxicity. hypomagnesemia was observed in 36% (grade 3/4 in 3%) of the patients in the
 xxxd2838xxx -containing group. one patient discontinued therapy due to grade 2 hypersensitivity reaction, and 1, due to dermatitis acneiform. none of the
patients treated with  xxxd2838xxx  who had baseline
and postbaseline data available were found to have
haha development. although  xxxd2838xxx  was
found to have efficacy as monotherapy, limitations of
this study included the high percentage of patients
who were crossed over to the  xxxd2838xxx  + bsc
group, resulting in a limited evaluation of survival in
both groups, a relatively young population, and a
good baseline ecog performance status in the majority of the study population.

adjunct to first-line therapy for mcrc
phase ii studies
clinical activity of  xxxd2838xxx  with fluorouracil
and irinotecan (ifl or  xxxd467xxx ) as first-line therapy
for mcrc was evaluated in a phase ii trial.49 part 1
of the study included  xxxd2838xxx  + ifl bolus, and
part 2 of the study included  xxxd2838xxx  + infusional  xxxd467xxx . patients were eligible if they had egfr
expression in ≥10% of tumor cells (method of measurement not specified) and had not received prior
chemotherapy.  xxxd2838xxx  was administered over
1 hour intravenously at a dose of 2.5 mg/kg qw with
ifl or  xxxd467xxx . primary end point of the study was
the incidence of grade 3/4 diarrhea. secondary end
points were objective tumor response by recist criteria, pfs, and os. tumor response was evaluated
every 6 weeks. a total of 19 patients were enrolled in
part 1 and 24 patients in part 2. an objective response
was seen in 47% (9) of the patients in part 1 and 33%
(8) in part 2 of the study. in part 1, partial response
was seen in 47% (9) of patients, stable disease was
achieved in 26% (5) of patients, progressive disease in
5% (1) of patients, median pfs was 5.6 months and
median survival was 16.8 months. in part 2, partial
response was observed in 33% (8) of patients, stable
disease in 46% (11) of patients, progressive disease
was observed in 13 (3%) patients, median pfs was
10.9 months, and median survival data were not
available. the incidence of diarrhea was numerically
january 2008

higher in the  xxxd2838xxx  + ifl arm (grade 3, 53%;
grade 4, 1%) versus the  xxxd2838xxx  +  xxxd467xxx 
arm (grade 3, 25%; grade 4, 0%) (no formal statistical analysis reported). all patients had treatment-related
skin toxicity, but no grade 4 skin-related toxicities occurred. in part 1 of the study, 16% had grade 3 skinrelated toxicities and in part 2, 17% had grade 3
toxicities. hypokalemia (16%), fatigue (11%), and
nausea (5%) were observed in part 1 of the study and
none were observed in part 2 of the study. grade 4 hypomagnesemia occurred in 1 patient in both parts of
the study. there were no severe infusion reactions or
 xxxd2838xxx -induced haha formation.

phase iii studies
a phase iii, multicenter, randomized, open-label trial
known as  xxxd2838xxx  advanced colorectal cancer
evaluation (pacce)50,51 was designed to compare
 xxxd2838xxx  + chemotherapy + bevacizumab versus
chemotherapy + bevacizumab alone as first-line treatment of mcrc. the primary end point of the study
was to assess whether the addition of  xxxd2838xxx  to
folfox + bevacizumab or  xxxd467xxx  + bevacizumab
would improve pfs. secondary end points were os, response, time to progression, time to treatment failure,
duration of response, and/or rate of stable disease.50,51
patients were randomized to receive infusional
folfox + bevacizumab (maximum, 800 patients) or
 xxxd467xxx  + bevacizumab (maximum, 200 patients)
with or without  xxxd2838xxx .50 exclusion criteria
were prior chemotherapy or biologic treatment for
mcrc.  xxxd2838xxx  was administered at a dose of
6 mg/kg q2w preceding chemotherapy infusions by an
hour or more.
the interim results of the pacce study were presented at the ninth world congress on gastrointestinal cancer in barcelona, spain in 2007.52 the
incidence of grade 4 aes was higher in the  xxxd2838xxx  group than the control group (28% vs 18%;
p not reported).52 aes included severe diarrhea
(21%), dehydration (percentage not reported), infections (percentage not reported), and pulmonary embolism. incidence of pulmonary embolism was 4% in
patients who received  xxxd2838xxx  versus 2% in patients who received placebo.53 the response rates between  xxxd2838xxx  and the control group also
appeared similar (39% with  xxxd2838xxx  vs 41%
without  xxxd2838xxx ; p not reported). pfs was significantly greater in the control arm, with a median of

clinical activity in other solid tumors
renal cancer
in a phase ii, multicenter, dose-escalating trial,30
 xxxd2838xxx  was evaluated in patients with metastatic renal cancer who were refractory to interleukin-2 or
interferon-alfa. a total of 95 patients were enrolled in
the study, with 88 patients receiving at least 1 dose of
 xxxd2838xxx . patients were evaluated for tumor response and tolerability. documentation of egfr positivity was not required prior to enrollment into the
study; however, egfr ihc staining was performed on
tumor biopsy specimens in 76 patients. ninety-one
percent (69) of patients scored 2+ to 3+ immunostaining in ≥10% of tumor cells. successive cohorts of patients were treated at the following doses: 1 (n = 22),
1.5 (n = 22), 2 (n = 23), and 2.5 mg/kg (n = 21) weekly. six percent (5/88) of patients responded (1 complete
response, 2 partial responses, and 2 minor responses).
disease stabilization was achieved in 44 (50%) patients at the week-8 assessment. the median pfs was
100 days (95% ci, 58–140 days). response to treatment did not correlate with the dose, egfr staining,
ecog performance status, or previous anticancer
treatment. patients who exhibited moderate or severe
skin toxicity had longer pfs than those with mild skin
toxicity, and significantly longer than those with no
skin toxicity (median, 128 days [95% ci, 80–168 days]
vs 76 days [95% ci, 53–161 days] vs 56 days [95%
ci, 41–115 days]; log-rank p = 0.014). the rates of
tumor response to  xxxd2838xxx  therapy seen in this
trial were low, suggesting poor activity of  xxxd2838xxx  in metastatic renal cell carcinoma.

non–small cell lung cancer
a phase ii, 2-part, open label, dose-escalating trial
of  xxxd2838xxx  in combination with paclitaxel and
carboplatin in advanced non–small cell lung cancer
(nsclc) is ongoing.55 efficacy, tolerability, and pharmacokinetic data were evaluated in part 1 of the
study. part 2 of the study will continue to accrue patients to further assess clinical activity. patients expressing 2+ or 3+ egfr staining in ≥10% of tumor cells
(method of egfr expression assessment not stated) received weekly  xxxd2838xxx  in combination with every
3 weeks standard paclitaxel and carboplatin for up to
22

6 cycles. patients with response or disease stabilization
at week 6 were able to continue treatment with  xxxd2838xxx . results of part 1 of the study are reported here.
a total of 19 patients (14 women, 5 men), with mean
age of 52.2 years (sd = 11.9 years), were enrolled in
1 of 3  xxxd2838xxx  cohorts: 1 (n = 6), 2 (n = 7), or
2.5 mg/kg qw (n = 6). one patient in the 1-mg/kg
group had a complete response. partial response was observed in 4 patients (2 in the 2-mg/kg and 2 in the
2.5-mg/kg cohort). the most common ae observed was
skin rash (89% overall; 83%, 100%, and 83% in the
1-, 2-, and 2.5-mg/kg groups, respectively). the incidence
of grade 3 rash did not correlate with the dose (17% at
1 mg/kg, 29% at 2 mg/kg, and 0% at 2.5 mg/kg).  xxxd2838xxx  dosing was stopped or reduced due to skin
toxicities in 1 patient in the 1-mg/kg group and
3 patients in the 2-mg/kg group. these preliminary findings suggest that the use of  xxxd2838xxx  in nsclc patients was relatively well tolerated. clinical efficacy data
on  xxxd2838xxx  are summarized in table v.

special populations
in a subset analysis of the phase iii trial of  xxxd2838xxx  in patients with mcrc who received  xxxd2838xxx  plus bsc versus bsc,21 influence of baseline
patient characteristics, such as age or ecog performance status, on response (defined as efficacy and tolerability) to  xxxd2838xxx  was assessed.56 the majority
of the patients had an ecog score of 0 to 1 (87% in
the  xxxd2838xxx  group, 84% in the bsc group)50 and
were white (99% in the  xxxd2838xxx  group, 98% in
the bsc group).56 all patients had been previously
treated with at least 2 chemotherapeutic regimens. a
larger proportion of patients was diagnosed with colon
cancer (67%) than rectal cancer (33%).56 forty-two
percent of patients in the  xxxd2838xxx  group were
aged 65 years or older, and 39% in the bsc group were
aged 65 years or older. the subset analysis showed that
efficacy and tolerability of  xxxd2838xxx  in mcrc
were not affected by age or ecog status.50
a phase i study of the use of  xxxd2838xxx  in
japanese patients with advanced solid malignancies
found good tolerability and no pharmacokinetic differences compared with non-japanese patients.39

drug interactions
several studies have found tolerability of  xxxd2838xxx  use together with other chemotherapeutic
agents. the pharmacokinetics of  xxxd2838xxx  added

to a regimen of ifl chemotherapy in patients with
mcrc was evaluated in a phase ii, single-arm study.
nineteen patients (16 male, 3 female) receiving  xxxd2838xxx  at a dose of 2.5 mg/kg qw for up to eight
6-week cycles were assessed.57 the pharmacokinetic
parameters of irinotecan or  xxxd2838xxx  were unchanged compared with monotherapy with each drug,
suggesting a lack of interaction between irinotecan
and  xxxd2838xxx  in patients with mcrc. however,
use of ifl with  xxxd2838xxx  is discouraged by the
manufacturer because the combination increases the
incidence of chemotherapy-induced diarrhea.8
data from 2 multicenter studies of  xxxd2838xxx 
with amg706 (an investigational oral multikinase inhibitor) plus carboplatin/paclitaxel for nsclc58 or
with gemcitabine, cisplatin, plus amg706 found no
pharmacokinetic interaction between  xxxd2838xxx 
and amg706.

infusion reactions

tolerability
rash

electrolyte abnormalities

 xxxd2838xxx  has been associated with acneiform
skin rash, which has been correlated with clinical outcome.18,59 the rash is thought to be related to the inhibition of the egfrs in the basal layers of the
epidermis.60 the incidence of rash increases relative to
the dose but is not dose-limiting and might improve
during treatment.30 in a study of once-weekly dosed
 xxxd2838xxx  in metastatic refractory renal carcinoma
patients, skin toxicity was the most common ae occurring in most patients by weeks 3 to 5.17,30 skin rash
was more prevalent with higher weekly doses of  xxxd2838xxx , with a 68% incidence at 1 mg/kg/wk doses
compared with 100% at 2.5-mg/kg/wk doses. pfs
was higher in patients exhibiting more severe skin toxicity than those exhibiting mild or no skin toxicity
(median, 128 days [95% ci, 80–168 days] vs 76 days
[95% ci, 53–161 days] vs 56 days [95% ci,
41–115 days]).30 rash may indicate that sufficient levels of antibody are present to exert antitumor activity.59 however, more evidence is still needed to
determine whether rash development and severity correlate with improved clinical response to anti-egfr
therapy.11,30,59,61 currently, there are no guidelines for
the treatment of egfr mab–induced rash. although
there is no standard treatment for cutaneous reactions,60
retinoids, steroids, emollients, antibiotics,17 and oral antihistamines60 have been used. preventive measures include avoiding direct sunlight, heat, and humidity.17
january 2008

severe infusion reactions, such as anaphylactic reactions, bronchospasm, fever, chills, and hypotension,
have occurred in a small proportion of patients (~1%)
receiving  xxxd2838xxx . although no fatal infusion reactions have been reported with  xxxd2838xxx , such reactions had been reported with other mabs; therefore,
the manufacturer recommends decreasing the infusion
rate by 50% in patients experiencing mild or moderate
(grade 1 or 2) infusion reaction and to permanently and
immediately discontinue  xxxd2838xxx  in patients experiencing severe (grade 3 or 4) infusion reactions.8

diarrhea
because the use of  xxxd2838xxx  with ifl has been
associated with an increased incidence of diarrhea
(58% vs 23% with  xxxd2838xxx  monotherapy),8,49
this combination is discouraged by the manufacturer.8

 xxxd2838xxx  has been associated with electrolyte
depletion, especially magnesium. in a phase iii trial,21
hypomagnesemia was observed in 36% of the patient
population. the manufacturer recommends monitoring electrolytes periodically during treatment with
 xxxd2838xxx  and for an additional 8 weeks after the
discontinuation of  xxxd2838xxx .8

pulmonary complications
pulmonary fibrosis occurred in <1% (2/1467) of
patients receiving  xxxd2838xxx .8 the manufacturer
recommends caution in prescribing  xxxd2838xxx  in
patients with underlying pulmonary disease, such as
interstitial pulmonary disease, pulmonary fibrosis, interstitial pneumonitis, or pulmonary infiltrates. the
risks of exacerbating these conditions have not been
thoroughly evaluated in clinical trials.8

nail changes
changes in nails might occur in patients receiving
egfr mab and can be manifested as paronychia or
pyogenic granuloma with secondary staphylococcus
aureus infection.62 it is important to counsel patients on
avoiding friction and pressure to nails as a preventive
method. topical antiseptics or antibiotics can be used
on a regular basis in patients who develop paronychia
because the nail folds are susceptible to infections. oral
antibiotics may be needed in cases of secondary infections based on culture and sensitivity.60,62

hair changes
eyelashes might turn long, rigid, and curly with
prolonged treatment with egfr mab.62 eyebrows
might become thicker and more rigid, whereas scalp
hair might grow more slowly and become finer, more
brittle, and curlier. mild hair loss might also occur on
the scalp, arms, and/or legs. these changes are a reflection of egfr inhibition.62
other aes associated with  xxxd2838xxx  are presented in table vi.8,18

dosing and administration
results from 2 phase i trials have found that  xxxd2838xxx  can be administered every 2 or 3 weeks.63
infusion of  xxxd2838xxx  6 mg/kg q2w administered
over 60 minutes or an initial infusion of 60 minutes
followed by 30 minutes of infusion in subsequent
doses has not been associated with changes in steadystate concentration.64 based on those results, the manufacturer recommends administering  xxxd2838xxx  at
a dose of 6 mg/kg over 60 minutes q2w, allowing incorporation into combination treatment with twiceweekly chemotherapeutic regimens.18 doses >1000 mg
should be administered over 90 minutes. the infusion
rate should be decreased by 50% in patients experiencing grade 1/2 infusion reactions, and permanent discontinuation is warranted if a patient develops grade
3/4 infusion reactions.8

comparison of  xxxd2838xxx  and
cetuximab
 xxxd2838xxx  and cetuximab belong to a class of
mab directed at the extracellular portion of the
egfr.38 both have been approved for salvage therapy
for mcrc, and cetuximab has also been approved for
use in head and neck cancer.2,3 however,  xxxd2838xxx  is the first fully human mab,38,65 while cetuximab
is a chimeric mab.9 because  xxxd2838xxx  is a humanized mab, the risk for immunogenic reactions is expected to be lower. neutralizing antibodies have been
observed in <1% of patients receiving  xxxd2838xxx .8
cetuximab has been associated with the development
of human antichimeric antibodies (hacas),9,38 although the percentage of neutralizing hacas was not
reported by the manufacturer. the longer elimination
t1/2 of  xxxd2838xxx  compared with cetuximab (7.5 vs
5–7 days) allows for longer dosing intervals of  xxxd2838xxx —every 2 weeks versus every week for cetuximab.8,44 electrolyte depletion, a possible class effect,

has been associated with both drugs. although not
compared directly in clinical trials, the incidences of
hypomagnesemia were 39% with  xxxd2838xxx  and
50% with cetuximab therapy.8,9,44 both drugs have
been associated with infusion reactions, but fatal infusion reactions have been reported only with cetuximab.8,9 the manufacturer of cetuximab recommends
premedication with a histamine antagonist, such as involume 30 number 1

travenous diphenhydramine, before cetuximab administration.9,65 at this time, no premedication is required
with the use of  xxxd2838xxx .8,65 the use of cetuximab in patients with coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, or arrhythmias has been associated
with cardiac arrest (2%, p value not available).9 currently, the manufacturer advises caution in patients
with cardiac comorbidities.9
in clinical studies, objective response rates to both
medications as monotherapy in mcrc were similar
(~10%).21,66 although not compared with each other
directly in prospective trials,  xxxd2838xxx  may be associated with a slightly longer time to disease progression
compared with cetuximab (2–3+21 vs 1.566 months);
therefore, there may be a slight advantage of  xxxd2838xxx  over cetuximab in disease-free survival.65

cost
the average wholesale price for a  xxxd2838xxx 
20-mg/ml 20-ml vial is us $4000. cost of therapy for
a 60-kg patient is ~$8000/mo. a formal review of the
literature did not identify any pharmacoeconomic studies of  xxxd2838xxx . further studies are needed to evaluate the cost–benefit ratio of  xxxd2838xxx  in mcrc.

ongoing trials
currently there are ongoing phase i through phase iii
clinical trials evaluating  xxxd2838xxx  in head and
neck cancer and nsclc, use of  xxxd2838xxx  with
other concomitant chemotherapeutic agents in mcrc,
and as monotherapy for mcrc. these trials will further define the role of  xxxd2838xxx  in crc and
other types of carcinoma.67

conclusions
 xxxd2838xxx  appears to have relatively acceptable tolerability and is now available as an additional option
for patients with mcrc refractory to multiple chemotherapeutic regimens. preclinical and clinical studies
have established a role for  xxxd2838xxx  in mcrc. at
the present time, the use of  xxxd2838xxx  as a first-line
agent in mcrc with standard chemotherapy and bevacizumab is not indicated due to increased toxicity, with
no advantage in efficacy. based on a phase iii trial of
 xxxd2838xxx  plus bsc versus bsc alone,  xxxd2838xxx  was effective in time-related end points such
as pfs.  xxxd2838xxx  is being evaluated in other solid
tumors such as lung, breast, ovarian, bladder, and
head and neck cancers.13 these trials will further dejanuary 2008

fine the role and place of  xxxd2838xxx  in mcrc and
other malignancies.
