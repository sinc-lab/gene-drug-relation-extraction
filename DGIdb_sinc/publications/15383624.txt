abstract
 xxxd3417xxx  receptor (rar)␤ is perceived to function as a tumor
suppressor gene in various contexts where its absence is associated with tumorigenicity and its presence causes cell cycle
arrest.  xxxd3297xxx  is a prodrug selective for rar␤/␥, thereby
motivating interest in determining whether  xxxd3297xxx  might activate putative tumor suppressor activity. using hl-60 human myeloblastic leukemia cells, a cell line that undergoes g0 cell cycle
arrest and myeloid differentiation in response to  xxxd3417xxx  (ra),
 xxxd3297xxx  failed to cause extracellular signal-regulated kinase
(erk) activation, a requirement for  xxxd3417xxx  (ra)-induced g0
arrest and differentiation; retinoblastoma (rb) hypophosphorylation, another characteristic of ra-induced g0 arrest and cell differentiation; g0 arrest; or differentiation into mature myeloid cells.
however, when used in combination with a retinoid x receptor
(rxr)-selective ligand,  xxxd3297xxx  caused erk activation, rb tu-

there is accumulating evidence that the  xxxd3417xxx  receptor (rar)␤ may have tumor suppressor activity. rar␤ is
a member of the rar family, which with the retinoid x
receptor (rxr) family, are ligand-activated transcription factors activated by retinoids. its expression is reduced or lost in
a number of tumors (xu, 2001; zhang et al., 2001; zou et al.,
2001; li et al., 2002). furthermore, in tumor-derived cell
lines resistant to  xxxd3417xxx -induced growth arrest, increasing or restoring rar␤ expression by ectopic expression
this work was supported in part by grants from the national institutes of
health and the united states department of agriculture.

mor suppressor protein hypophosphorylation, g0 arrest, and myeloid differentiation. the kinetics of g0 arrest and differentiation
was similar to that of ra. dose-response studies showed that
diminishing  xxxd3297xxx  progressively diminished both induced cell
differentiation and g0 arrest, where the doses for cellular effects
were consistent with the transcriptional transactivation data. for
either  xxxd3297xxx  or an rar␣-selective ligand, diminishing the
coadministered rxr-selective ligand diminished both induced differentiation and g0 arrest.  xxxd3297xxx  could propel either early or
late portions of the period leading to differentiation and g0 arrest
and was interchangeable with an rar␣-selective ligand.  xxxd3297xxx  used with rxr-selective ligand may thus be a useful antineoplastic agent in differentiation induction therapy as exemplified
by the prototypical ra treatment of acute  xxxg1785xxx .

confers response to  xxxd3417xxx  (si et al., 1996; wu et al.,
1998; faria et al., 1999; wan et al., 1999; weber et al., 1999).
the growth inhibitory action of rar␤ may in part reflect its
ability to inhibit the transcriptional activity of ap-1, the fos
and jun heterodimer whose activity is typically up-regulated
with cell proliferation or tumor progression (lin et al., 2000).
these considerations motivate interest in the potential antiproliferative effects of rar␤ agonists.
the mechanism of action of  xxxd3417xxx , which with its
retinoid cellular metabolites causes activation of rars and
rxrs, has been studied in a variety of tumor-derived cell
lines. one of the longest studied and perhaps most fully
characterized molecularly is the hl-60 human myeloblastic
leukemia cell line (collins et al., 1977; yen, 1990), which was

with either granulocyte  xxxg526xxx  or licl enhanced resulting differentiation (finch et al., 2000). although a significant amount of data thus indicates the importance of rar␣ activation to eliciting  xxxd3417xxx -induced
growth arrest and differentiation, the case for rar␤ is not as
well studied.
 xxxd3297xxx  is ethyl 6-[2-(4, 4-dimethylthiochroman-6-yl)ethynyl] nicotinate, a drug used for the treatment of psoriasis. it is metabolized by a ubiquitous esterase to its active
form, tazarotenic acid, a rar␤/␥-selective retinoid. in keratinocytes,  xxxd3297xxx  was found to induce the expression of
tig3, a putative class ii tumor suppressor gene 52% identical to h-rev 107 (disepio et al., 1998). it presents an opportunity to study consequences of rar␤-activated pathways in
hl-60 cells. the present results show that it has potential
antineoplastic activity if used in differentiation induction
therapy.

materials and methods
cells and culture conditions. hl-60 human myeloblastic leukemia cells (collins et al., 1977) were continuously cultured in rpmi
1640 medium (invitrogen, carlsbad, ca) supplemented with 5%
fetal calf serum (intergen, purchase, ny) as described previously
(brooks et al., 1996; yen et al., 1998, 1999). stock cells were maintained in 10-ml cultures that were initiated at a density of 0.2 ⫻ 106
cells/ml for 2 days, twice a week, and then 0.1 ⫻ 106 cells/ml for 3
days, once a week, to sustain constant exponential growth.
experimental 30-ml cultures were initiated at a cell density of
0.2 ⫻ 106 cells/ml with  xxxd3417xxx  (sigma-aldrich, st. louis, mo),
 xxxd408xxx  (solvay duphar b.v., weesp, the netherlands) or retinoids as indicated.  xxxd3417xxx  or 1,25-dihydroxy
 xxxd1682xxx  was added from a 10⫺3 m stock in ethanol stored at
⫺20°c protected from light. retinoids were likewise added, as described previously (brooks et al., 1996), from 5 mm stocks that were
solubilized in ethanol and stored at ⫺80°c protected from light.
agn90169, also called  xxxd3297xxx , an rar␤/␥-selective ligand; and
agn194301, an rar␣-selective antagonist, were a generous gift of
allergan, inc. (irvine, ca). ro40-6055, an rar␣-selective ligand,
also known as am580; ro25-7386, an rxr-selective ligand that can
activate transcription through rxr␣, but not rxr␥; and ro41-5253,
an rar␣ antagonist (brooks et al., 1996), were generous gifts of f.
hoffmann-la roche (nutley, nj). in experiments treating cells with
 xxxd3417xxx  or  xxxd408xxx , the final concentration in
culture was 1.0 ⫻ 10⫺6 m  xxxd3417xxx  and 0.5 ⫻ 10⫺6 m 1,25dihydroxy  xxxd1682xxx . all retinoids were used at a final concentration of 1.0 ⫻ 10⫺6 m unless otherwise noted as follows. in doseresponse experiments treating cells with different doses of
 xxxd3297xxx , the final concentrations of  xxxd3297xxx  were 1.0 ⫻ 10⫺6,
1.0 ⫻ 10⫺7, 1.0 ⫻ 10⫺8, and 1.0 ⫻ 10⫺9 m. in dose-response experiments treating cells with different doses of rar␣ agonist, the final
concentrations of rar␣ agonist were 1.0 ⫻ 10⫺6, 1.0 ⫻ 10⫺7, 1.0 ⫻
10⫺8, and 1.0 ⫻ 10⫺9 m. in experiments treating cells with an rar␣
agonist, rxr agonist, and an rar␣ antagonist, agn194301, the
final concentrations in culture of the antagonist were 1.0 ⫻ 10⫺9 or
1.0 ⫻ 10⫺8 m. in experiments with cells treated with either an rar␣
agonist plus an rxr agonist or  xxxd3297xxx  plus an rxr agonist in
the absence or presence of an rar␣ antagonist, ro41-5253, the final
concentration of rar␣ agonist was 1.0 ⫻ 10⫺8 m. in experiments
where cells were treated with  xxxd3297xxx  plus an rxr agonist for
24 h and then an rar␣ agonist plus an rxr agonist thereafter, the
entire culture was harvested by centrifugation at 24 h, resuspended,
and washed twice in approximately 20 ml of warmed (37°c) serumsupplemented medium, incubated for 10 min, and then resuspended
in the original volume of fresh medium containing the second treat-

isolated from a patient with what was retrospectively reevaluated as a myeloblastic (fab m1) leukemia. rar␣ and
rar␤, but not rar␥, and rxr␣ and rxr␤, but not rxr␥,
have been observed in hl-60 cells (de the et al., 1989; nervi
et al., 1989; hashimoto et al., 1990; yu et al., 1991; kizaki et
al., 1993) where rar␣ protein is expressed at higher levels
than rar␤ protein (gaub et al., 1989; hashimoto et al.,
1989). hl-60 cells proliferate avidly in culture and undergo
g0 cell cycle arrest and either myeloid or monocytic differentiation, depending on the agent they are treated with.  xxxd3417xxx  induces myeloid differentiation, and 1,25-dihydroxy
 xxxd1682xxx  induces monocytic differentiation. the process of
induced g0 arrest and differentiation segregates into two
segments, an early one that primes the cells to differentiate
without lineage specificity and a late one wherein the myeloid or monocytic lineage is determined (yen et al., 1987;
yen and forbes, 1990). in the hl-60 subline studied, the
onset of g0 arrest and differentiation typically is apparent
after 48 h of exposure to ra, a period corresponding approximately to the duration of two cell cycles. the duration of the
early period is approximately the duration of one cell cycle
and leads to a precommitment state where cells are primed to
differentiate without regard to lineage specificity, which is
determined during the subsequent late period, the duration
of which is also approximately one cell cycle time. activation
of rar␣ plus rxrs by receptor-selective ligands results in
g0 arrest and myeloid differentiation with kinetics comparable with that elicited by  xxxd3417xxx , whereas activation of
either rar␣ or rxr separately is essentially ineffective
(brooks et al., 1996).  xxxd3417xxx  and its presumed cellular
metabolites thus need to activate rar␣ and rxr to cause g0
arrest and myeloid differentiation of hl-60 cells. likewise,
 xxxd3417xxx  also causes rar␣ plus rxr-dependent prolonged activation of the  xxxg1366xxx  mapk, which is necessary to
elicit g0 arrest and differentiation (yen et al., 1998, 1999).
inhibiting mapk signaling abrogated  xxxd3417xxx -induced
growth arrest and differentiation, whereas augmenting it
enhanced  xxxd3417xxx -induced arrest and differentiation.
one of the hallmarks of  xxxd3417xxx -induced mapk-dependent cellular response, namely, g0 arrest and myeloid differentiation, is the conversion of hyperphosphorylated rb tumor suppressor protein to the hypophosphorylated form (yen
et al., 1994, 1996, 1997a,b; brooks et al., 1996; yen and
soong, 1996). it is not known whether rar␤ can propel any
of these processes, although it might be suspected given its
potential tumor suppressor activity.
a significant amount of data indicates that rar␣ activation is seminal to  xxxd3417xxx -induced differentiation. for
example, ectopic expression of rar␣ in hl-60 cells resistant
to  xxxd3417xxx  induced differentiation restored retinoic acidinducible differentiation (mehta et al., 1997). in wild-type
hl-60 cells, rxr/rxr homodimer activation had little effect
on differentiation or growth arrest, but activation of rar/
rxr heterodimers with rxr/rxr homodimers resulted in
growth inhibition and differentiation (kizaki et al., 1996).
also suggesting the importance of rar␣ specifically, ectopic
expression in murine marrow progenitor cells of rar␣, its
dominant negative and its fusion proteins, pml-rar␣,
plzf-rar␣, and npm-rar␣, found in myeloid leukemias,
showed that altering the rar␣ pathway caused growth perturbations, but overexpression of rar␤, rar␥, or rxr␣ did
not (du et al., 1999). in wehi murine myeloid leukemia

ment as described previously (brooks et al., 1996). parallel cultures
were treated with rar␣ agonist in lieu of  xxxd3297xxx  as a control. in
experiments where  xxxd3297xxx  was used as the second rather than
the first treatment, the same protocol was used. in rxr dose-response experiments treating cells with either  xxxd3297xxx  or an rar␣
agonist plus different concentrations of rxr agonist, the concentration of  xxxd3297xxx  and rar␣ agonist was 1.0 ⫻ 10⫺6 m, and the final
concentrations of rxr agonist were 1.0 ⫻ 10⫺6, 1.0 ⫻ 10⫺7, and 1.0 ⫻
10⫺8 m. at the indicated times after initiation of culture/treatment,

cells were harvested to determine cell density, differentiation, cell
cycle distribution, or western analysis. all experiments shown are
typical of two or more repeats.
assays of growth and differentiation. assays of cell growth
by measuring cell density and distribution in the cell cycle, and
assays of cell differentiation detected by inducible oxidative metabolism were performed as described previously (brooks et al., 1996;
yen et al., 1998; yen et al., 1999). in brief, cell density in experimental cultures was measured by repeated counts with a hemacytometer. viability was assessed by exclusion of 0.2% trypan blue dye and
was routinely at least 95% in all cultures. the distribution of cells in
the cell cycle was determined by flow cytometry using  xxxd3027xxx 
iodide-stained nuclei. cells (0.5 ⫻ 106) were harvested at each indicated time and resuspended in 0.5 ml of hypotonic  xxxd3027xxx 
solution (0.05 mg/ml  xxxd3027xxx , 1 mg/liter sodium citrate, and
0.1% triton x-100) and stored refrigerated and protected from light
until analyzed. flow cytometric analysis was done with a multiparameter dual laser fluorescence activated cell sorter (epics 753;

1995). in brief, transcriptional activation through rars by  xxxd3297xxx  was characterized by a chimeric receptor assay in which cv-1
cells were transiently transfected with a promoter-reporter construct, ere-tk-luc, bearing a luciferase reporter under control of an
 xxxg730xxx  binding site that responds only to retinoids, plus
the expression vector for an er-rar fusion protein in which the
dna binding domain of the rar, either ␣, ␤, or ␥, was replaced by an
 xxxg730xxx  dna binding domain. treating cells with  xxxd3297xxx  at the indicated concentrations resulted in the reported luciferase activity. transcriptional activation through rxrs were measured in the holoreceptor activity assay performed by transiently
transfecting with an rxr-responsive reporter plasmid,  xxxg1938xxx  ii-tkluc, which contains dr1 elements from the human  xxxg1938xxx  ii promoter plus an rxr expression vector. a ␤-galactosidase expression
vector was used as an internal control for transfection efficiency. the
chimeric receptor assay was used in the case of rars and the
holoreceptor assay in the case of rxrs because cv-1 cells have an
endogenous rar-rxr heterodimer activity, which use of the chimeric receptor assay circumvents; but there is no detectable rxrrxr homodimer activity, which allows use of the holoreceptor assay.

results
motivated by the putative tumor suppressor activity of
rar␤, the experiments to be described characterize how
rar␤ activation through  xxxd3297xxx  affects the growth and
differentiation of a human myeloblastic leukemia cell line.
the first experiments show the selective rar␤-transactivating capability of  xxxd3297xxx , whose chemical structure is
shown in fig. 1. ra-induced erk phosphorylation and rb
hypophosphorylation are prerequisite for ra-induced cell differentiation and g0 cell cycle arrest, and the next experiments show that  xxxd3297xxx  by itself fails to cause enhanced
erk phosphorylation or hypophosphorylation of rb like ra
but that it does when used with an rxr-selective ligand. the
next experiments then show that  xxxd3297xxx  by itself fails to
cause differentiation or arrest, but it does when used with an
rxr-selective ligand. dose-response studies then show that

tabolism was assayed by phorbol 12- xxxd2681xxx  13-acetate (sigmaaldrich)-inducible oxidative metabolism resulting in intracellular
reduction of nitroblue tetrazolium to formazan by superoxide. cells
(0.2 ⫻ 106) were harvested at the indicated times and resuspended in
0.2 ml of 2 mg/ml nitroblue tetrazolium in pbs containing 200 ng/ml
phorbol 12- xxxd2681xxx  13-acetate in  xxxd1896xxx . the cell suspension was incubated for 20 min in a 37°c water bath and then
scored using a hemacytometer for the percentage expressing intracellular purple formazan precipitated by superoxide. over 200 cells
were counted per sample, and variation in replicates is routinely
within 10%.
western analysis of rb and activated mapk. western blotting was done using whole cell lysates from cells as described previously (brooks et al., 1996; yen et al., 1998; hong et al., 2001). at
indicated times, 106 cells were harvested and fixed in 1 ml of 90%
methanol at ⫺20°c. the cells were stored at ⫺20°c until analysis by
sds-page. cells were solubilized in 50 ␮l of loading buffer (6% sds,
4 m urea, 4 mm edta, 125 mm tris, ph 6.9, 0.25% bromphenol
blue, and 35 ␮l/ml ␤- xxxd26xxx ) by boiling in a water bath for
5 min. sds-page was done using a 4% stacking gel and a 10%
resolving gel with 37.5:1 acrylamide/bis. samples were electrophoresed for 1200 v-hours., typically 75 v for 16 h. then, 1 ⫻ 106 cells
were loaded per lane. proteins were electrotransferred (trans blot
cell; bio-rad, hercules, ca) from the gel to a nitrocellulose membrane. transfer was done at 0.8 amps for 1 h. the resulting membrane was blocked by overnight immersion at 4 c in 5% powdered
milk and 0.05% tween 20 in pbs (pbs-t). the membranes were
stained with ponceau s dye to check uniformity of lane loading and
electrotransfer as described previously (hong et al., 2001). the membranes were probed with antibodies detecting the phosphorylated
and unphosphorylated forms of rb and the activated  xxxg1366xxx  and 1
bearing a tey motif with t(183) and y(185) phosphorylation. the
antibody to detect rb (rb gene product (mab1) monoclonal antibody; zymed laboratories, south san francisco, ca) was used at 0.4
mg/ml pbs-t with an overnight incubation at 40°c. the antibody
used to detect activated  xxxg1369xxx  and 2 (#v6671 rabbit polyclonal
antibody; promega, madison, wi) was used at 0.025 ␮g/ml in 0.1%
bovine  xxxg124xxx  in pbs-t with a 2-h incubation at room
temperature. detection was performed using a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary anti-mouse or -rabbit antibody and enhanced chemiluminescence (ecl kit; amersham biosciences inc.,
piscataway, nj) following the manufacturer’s instructions.
transactivation assays. transcriptional activation assays of
rar␣,␤,␥ and rxr␣,␤,␥ were performed as described previously
using transient transfection to coexpress the specific receptor subtype and a promoter-reporter with luciferase read out (nagpal et al.,

through rar␤, is approximately 1.5 logs less effective at
activating through rar␥, almost 3 logs less effective at activating through rar␣, and largely ineffective at activating
through rxrs. in this assay, 10⫺8 m resulted in approximately half-maximal transcriptional activation through
rar␤, but essentially no detectable transcriptional activation through rar␣ or rar␥.
used to treat hl-60 cells,  xxxd3297xxx  by itself was ineffective
at causing erk activation or rb hypophosphorylation, but
synergized with an rxr agonist (ro25-7386, an rxr-selective
ligand with rxr␣ transactivating activity) to activate erk and
to shift rb from the hyperphosphorylated to the hypophosphorylated state. rxr␣,␤,␥ agonists by themselves have previously
been shown to be ineffective at causing either erk activation
(hong et al., 2001) or conversion of rb from the hyperphosphorylated to the hypophosphorylated state (brooks et al., 1996).
figure 3 shows the western blot of phospho-erk using an
antibody specific for t(183)ey(185) phosphorylated activated
erk, an assay that correlates with both phosphorylation-induced gel electrophoretic mobility retardation and in vitro kinase activity as reported previously (yen et al., 1998). hl-60
cells were treated with ra,  xxxd3297xxx ,  xxxd3297xxx  plus an rxr

the induced differentiation and g0 arrest are both sensitive
to diminishing doses of  xxxd3297xxx , where the doses for cellular effects are consistent with the transactivating doses.
likewise dosing down the rxr-selective ligand used with
 xxxd3297xxx  also attenuated induced differentiation and g0
arrest. sequential drug treatment experiments then show
that  xxxd3297xxx  and the rar␣-selective ligand are interchangeable during the early or late phases of the period
before induced differentiation and g0 arrest. the last experiments show that  xxxd3297xxx  used with an rxr-selective
ligand or with both rar␣ plus rxr-selective ligands is unable to cause an ra-resistant cell to differentiate and g0
arrest. in sum,  xxxd3297xxx  (agn190168) is an rar␤ and to a
much lesser extent rar␥- or rar␣-activating retinoid that
synergizes with an rxr agonist to cause erk activation, rb
hypophosphorylation, differentiation, and g0 arrest of hl-60
human myeloblastic leukemia cells.
 xxxd3297xxx  is an rar␤-selective transactivator. figure 2
shows the transactivation of rar␣, rar␤, rar␥ and rxr␣,
rxr␤, rxr␥. as described previously (nagpal et al., 1995),
cv-1 cells were cotransfected with a promoter reporter construct and the respective receptor and then treated with the

rxr agonist for 48 h. the cells were harvested and whole cell
lysate was resolved by page and phospho-erk detected by
western blotting. the blot shows that although  xxxd3297xxx  by
itself failed to augment erk activation, when used in combination with an rxr agonist, it augmented erk activation to a
comparable degree as ra or the combination of an rar␣ agonist plus an rxr agonist. the synergism of  xxxd3297xxx  plus an
rxr agonist was corroborated by induced rb protein hypophosphorylation. figure 4 shows the western blot of rb protein
expression. hl-60 cells treated with the above-mentioned
agents for 96 h were analyzed by western blotting for rb
protein expression. the gel mobility of hyperphosphorylated rb
is retarded relative to hypophosphorylated rb, which is apparent as a faster migrating discrete band. although untreated

hl-60 cells showed little hypophosphorylated rb protein, ra
caused loss of most hyperphosphorylated rb and accrual of
hypophosphorylated rb, as reported previously (yen et al.,
1994, 1996, 1997a,b; brooks et al., 1996; yen and soong, 1996).
 xxxd3297xxx  by itself was largely ineffective at causing loss of
hyperphosphorylated rb, but with some accrual of hypophosphorylated rb. in contrast  xxxd3297xxx  administered with an
rxr agonist caused loss of hyperphosphorylated rb and accrual or hypophosphorylated rb similar to ra or treatment
with an rar␣-selective ligand plus an rxr ligand.  xxxd3297xxx 
was thus by itself ineffective at inducing molecular responses
that characterize cellular differentiation and g0 arrest induced
by ra. however, when used with an rxr-selective ligand, it
caused erk activation and rb hypophosphorylation.

reducing the amount of  xxxd3297xxx  used diminished the
amount of both cell differentiation and cell cycle arrest as
measured by the percentage of cells capable of inducible
oxidative metabolism and by the percentage of cells in g1/0.
at 96 h, after a 2 log reduction in dose to 10⫺8 m,  xxxd3297xxx 
still caused at least half the maximum cell differentiation
and g0 arrest; but after a further reduction in dose to 10⫺9 m,
 xxxd3297xxx  had little effect on differentiation or arrest (fig.
6). it is interesting that the 10⫺8 and 10⫺9 m  xxxd3297xxx 
concentrations are those where transcriptional activation
(fig. 1) through rar␤ was diminished by approximately half
and then lost, respectively, compared with the maximum
elicited by 10⫺6 m. the 10⫺8 m concentration was also the
concentration where there was still significant transcriptional activation through rar␤, but none detectable through
rar␣ or rar␥, in the promoter-reporter assays described
above (fig. 2).  xxxd3297xxx  used with an rxr-selective agonist could thus propel cell differentiation and g0 arrest with
kinetics similar to that of ra. the cellular dose response
coincidentally roughly paralleled the dose response for transcriptional activation through rar␤.
diminishing the rxr agonist dose diminishes induced cell

after 96 h. figure 7 shows the percentage of differentiated
cells as the rxr agonist concentration decreases by logs from
10⫺6 to 10⫺8 m. the percentage of cells with g1/0 dna is also
shown under these conditions. diminishing rxr agonist
caused diminished differentiation as well as g1/0 arrest for
both  xxxd3297xxx  and the rar␣-selective agonist. the rxr

both  xxxd3297xxx  and the rar␣ agonist, consistent with sim-

 xxxd3297xxx  by itself is not effective at causing cell differentiation and g0 cell cycle arrest, but it synergizes with an
rxr agonist to induce differentiation and g0 arrest. it has
been previously shown that an rxr agonist by itself is ineffective at causing differentiation or g0 arrest (brooks et al.,
1996). hl-60 cells were cultured with  xxxd3297xxx , and samples were harvested at 24-h intervals to determine the fraction of cells capable of inducible oxidative metabolism, a
functional differentiation marker that characterizes mature
myeloid cells, and also the percentage of cells with g1/0 dna,
where g0 cell cycle arrest is betrayed by an enrichment
thereof. for comparison, cells were also treated with retinoic
acid, which induces myeloid differentiation and g1/0 arrest.
the control cells were untreated. figure 5 shows the percentage of cells that were capable of inducible oxidative metabolism, detected as the percentage of cells capable of intracellular reduction of nbt to formazan, and the percentage of
cells with g1/0 dna, detected by flow cytometry of  xxxd3027xxx 
iodide-stained nuclear dna. ra caused onset of differentiation and g1/0 arrest by 48 h that progressed until the population was largely differentiated and arrested by 96 h. by
comparison,  xxxd3297xxx  caused only a small increment in
differentiated cells by about 48 h and likewise in the case of
g0 arrest. in contrast,  xxxd3297xxx  used with an rxr-selective
agonist caused cell differentiation and g1/0 cell cycle arrest
comparable with that of  xxxd3417xxx . hl-60 cells were
treated with  xxxd3297xxx  plus an rxr-selective agonist and
cell differentiation and g1/0 arrest were assayed at 24-h
intervals as before. to ascertain dose-response effects, the
concentration of  xxxd3297xxx  was decreased by logs from 10⫺6
to 10⫺9 m. figure 6 shows the percentage of differentiated
cells and cells with g1/0 dna. used with an rxr-selective

arrest, then the kinetics of induced differentiation and g0
arrest should be similar for the two cases. figure 8 shows
the typical percentage of differentiated cells and cells with
g1/0 dna during treatment in the two cases. the kinetics
of induced differentiation and g0 arrest were indistinguishable for the two cases. in contrast to 24, 48, and 96 h,
the deviation from coincidence at 72 h is experimental
variation and not a feature of repeats.  xxxd3297xxx  and the
rar␣ agonist thus effected equivalent cellular consequences during the early and late period, leading to differentiation and g0 arrest. corroborating this, erk activation, which is known to propel differentiation and arrest,
was apparent after sequential treatment at 48 h (fig. 3).
likewise, rb protein was converted from the hyperphosphorylated to the hypophosphorylated state (fig. 4). the
data are consistent with the suggestion that rar␣ and
rar␤ activation can function as equivalent alternatives
for causing differentiation and g0 arrest.

ilar dependencies on rxr activation for both rar␣ and
rar␤ to induce differentiation and arrest.
in the hl-60 subline studied, it is known that the onset
of g0 arrest and differentiation typically is apparent after
48 h of exposure to ra or  xxxd408xxx , a period
that segregates into two distinct segments, early (precommitment) and late events.  xxxd3297xxx  effects early events
leading to the precommitment primed state, as well as late
events leading from precommitment to onset of terminal
differentiation and g0 arrest, which are equivalent to
those effected by an rar␣-selective agonist. hl-60 cells
were cultured either with  xxxd3297xxx  plus an rxr agonist
for 24 h to effect precommitment priming and then with an
rar␣ agonist plus an rxr agonist thereafter or with an
rar␣ agonist plus an rxr agonist first and then  xxxd3297xxx  plus an rxr agonist. if the  xxxd3297xxx  and rar␣
agonist cause equivalent cellular effects during the early
and the late segments, leading to differentiation and g0

rar␤ causing g0 arrest, differentiation

in these cells, consistent with the above-mentioned suggestion that  xxxd3297xxx  and an rar␣ agonist effect equivalent
cellular responses.

discussion
the data are consistent with the suggestion that  xxxd3297xxx , acting through rar␤ in concert with an rxr agonist,
causes erk activation, wholesale conversion of hyperphosphorylated rb to the hypophosphorylated form, and consequential cell differentiation and g0 cell cycle arrest. there
are obvious caveats to this rar␤ based interpretation. one
cannot eliminate the possibility that the  xxxd3297xxx  is affecting cell physiology in some way that is independent of its
action through rar␤ but that mimics the necessary seminal
process(es) attributed to ra or the combination of an rar␣selective agonist plus an rxr-selective agonist. one possible
candidate process is the known ability of  xxxd3297xxx  and
other retinoids to inhibit ap-1 activation (nagpal et al.,
1995). for example,  xxxd3297xxx  and other retinoids can block
 xxxd2925xxx -induced ap-1 activation-dependent gene regulation in some cells. in the case of
hl-60 cells treated with ra, the inhibition of ap-1 as a
component of the machinery that propels the cell cycle and

 xxxd3297xxx  plus an rxr agonist was unable to overcome
resistance to induced differentiation and g0 arrest in an
hl-60 cell subline made resistant to ra by prolonged culture
in progressively increasing amounts of ra. the cells, hl60r⫺/d⫹, were thus resistant to ra, but differentiation and
g0 arrest caused by  xxxd408xxx  was not impaired. although it has been suggested that ra resistance
frequently arises because of a mutational hot spot causing
truncation of the rar␣ receptor, the truncation, which
causes conversion of a fok1 site to a premature stop codon,
was not detected in these cells (a. yen and s. varvayanis,
unpublished data). a block of some other ra-effected cellular
response thus presumably causes resistance. hl-60r⫺/d⫹
cells were cultured with either  xxxd3297xxx  plus an rxrselective agonist, an rar␣ agonist plus an rxr agonist,
 xxxd3297xxx  plus an rar␣ agonist plus an rxr agonist, 9-cis
ra, or  xxxd408xxx . figure 9 shows the percentage of differentiated cells and cells with g1/0 dna during
treatment in each case tested.  xxxd3297xxx  used in any of the
tested combinations failed to induce differentiation or g0
arrest, whereas  xxxd408xxx  caused both differentiation and g0 arrest with kinetics characteristic of the
wild-type parental cells reported previously.  xxxd3297xxx  plus
an rxr agonist was thus unable to overcome ra resistance

cell differentiation effects of ra has been largely discounted
(mollinedo et al., 1993; kizaki et al., 1996). ra does not alter
ap-1 activation in hl-60 cells (mollinedo et al., 1993; matikainen et al., 1994; davis-alison et al., 1997), nor does a
retinoid that has ap-1 inhibitory activity without activating
rar or rxr transcriptional activity cause differentiation or
growth arrest (kizaki et al., 1996). there may be a variety of
other yet occult processes that are also potential common
targets of retinoids with antiproliferative or differentiationinducing activity. whereas these cannot be formally eliminated, the simplest rationalization of the present results is
consistent with previous findings on rar␤’s tumor-suppressive effects, whereby  xxxd3297xxx  acting through rar␤ coadministered with an rxr agonist causes conversion of the
proliferatively active hl-60 myeloblastic leukemia cells to a
proliferatively quiescent, differentiated mature myeloid cell
with the rb tumor suppressor interestingly acting as a potential downstream intermediary.
the sequential treatment data suggest that activation of
rar␤, such as by  xxxd3297xxx , and rar␣, such as by the
rar␣ agonist, effect equivalent cellular responses during the
early and late periods, leading to onset of differentiation and
g0 arrest. however, dose-response studies show that the
effects of putative rar␣ activation and rar␤ activation are
probably not identical (table 1). comparing the dose-response data for rar␣ agonist-induced differentiation and
arrest and also  xxxd3297xxx -induced differentiation and g0
arrest showed that grossly diminishing rar␣ agonist dose
failed to grossly diminish induced cell cycle arrest in contrast
to the diminishing responses in the other cases. the data are
consistent with the suggestion that induced g0 arrest may be
more responsive to rar␣ activation than rar␤ activation.
thus, whereas rar␤ and rar␣ activation may cause equivalent cellular responses with respect to eliciting differentiation and g0 arrest, this is not to say that they elicit identical
responses.  xxxd3297xxx  may thus provide an alternative to
rar␣ activation as a route to antineoplastic effects. the
finding of potential antineoplastic activity for  xxxd3297xxx  is
consistent with a recent report of the potential chemoprevention activity of  xxxd3297xxx  (so et al., 2004). finally, a noteworthy implication of the studies presented here is that given
these activities of  xxxd3297xxx , then clinical administration of
 xxxd3297xxx  in the presence of an rxr agonist has potential
teratogenic activity.
