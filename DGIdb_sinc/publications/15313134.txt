abstract
dirofilaria immitis is a filarial nematode that infects dogs and causes cardiopulmonary disease. the most effective way of controlling the
infection is by chemoprophylaxis, using members of the avermectin/milbemycin (a/m) class of anthelmintics, which includes ivermectin;
these drugs act at invertebrate glutamate-gated chloride channels (glucl). we have cloned two cdnas encoding d. immitis glucl subunits
and demonstrated that at least one may be an important molecular target for the a/ms in vivo. the subunits are orthologues of the
alternatively spliced glucla3a and a3b subunits (encoded by the avr-14 gene) previously identified in caenorhabditis elegans and in
haemonchus contortus. although the alternative splicing of avr-14 is conserved across the species, the processing of the mature glucla3a
mrna differs in d. immitis compared to c. elegans and h. contortus. two-electrode voltage clamp recordings were made from xenopus
oocytes injected with subunit-specific crnas. the diglucla3b subunit formed channels that were gated by l -glutamate (1– 100 mm) and
ivermectin (1 mm). oocytes injected with diglucla3a crna failed to respond to l -glutamate. the qualitative responses obtained were
consistent with the pharmacology observed for the glucla3 subunits from c. elegans and h. contortus.

1. introduction
the filarial nematode, dirofilaria immitis, primarily
infects domesticated dogs and, to a lesser extent, cats, with
wild canines and ferrets acting as potential reservoirs for
infection. the adult parasites reside within the pulmonary
arteries and right side of the heart, with infection commonly
leading to pulmonary hypertension and, in severe cases,
right-sided heart failure (knight, 1987). chemoprophylaxis,
using members of the avermectin/milbemycin (a/m) class
of anthelmintics including ivermectin, milbemycin oxime,
moxidectin and selamectin, is the most effective way of
controlling disease (knight, 1999). these drugs act at
invertebrate glutamate-gated chloride channels (glucl)

et al., 1995) which are members of the ligand-gated chloride
channel superfamily, closely related to the mammalian
glycine and gabaa receptors (cully et al., 1994; vassilatis
et al., 1997). the a/ms appear to either directly activate
glucl or, at lower concentrations, potentiate the effects of
l -glutamate, the natural ligand of these receptors. although
these anthelmintics are extremely effective at killing the
larval stages of d. immitis and the other filaria, they are
much less effective against the adult worms, though they
may have a partial adulticide effect over long treatment
periods (rawlings, 2002) and cause a long-term suppression
of the production of new microfilariae (lok et al., 1995).
the reason for this difference is not yet understood: one
possible explanation could be that there are differences in
glucl expression between the adult and larval stages. we
are interested in determining the molecular basis of the
observed biological effects of the a/ms on parasitic
nematodes, including the filaria, and, as a first step, are
identifying the gene products thought to act as the major
targets for these drugs.
nematodes possess a small family of genes encoding
glucl subunits (yates et al., 2003). there is some evidence

that the composition of this family may vary between
species: in particular the parasite haemonchus contortus
possesses at least one subunit (hcglucla) (forrester et al.,
1999; cheeseman et al., 2001) that is not present in
caenorhabditis elegans, the organism for which we have
the most complete information. expression of this gene is
developmentally regulated (forrester et al., 1999). in order
to fully understand the interactions between the a/m
anthelmintics and individual parasite species, it is necessary
to determine how many possible target genes and gene
products that species possesses and then characterise when
and where the gene products are expressed. the first step in
this process is the identification of candidate target genes
and we report here that d. immitis possesses a gene
orthologous to c. elegans avr-14 (laughton et al., 1997;
dent et al., 2000), which encodes the alternatively spliced
glucla3a and a3b subunits. this gene is also present in the
parasites h. contortus, ascaris suum (jagannathan et al.,
1999) and cooperia oncophora (njue et al., 2004). in
c. elegans, h. contortus and c. oncophora at least one of the
avr-14 gene products forms an ivermectin-sensitive glucl
when expressed in vitro (dent et al., 2000; cheeseman et al.,
2001; njue et al., 2004). partial cdna sequences with a high
degree of identity to avr-14 from the filarial species
onchocerca volvulus and d. immitis have been reported
previously (cully et al., 1996b), the latter serving as a starting
point for the isolation of full-length clones from d. immitis.

2. materials and methods
2.1. molecular cloning
approximately 0.3 – 0.5 g of frozen adult female
d. immitis (supplied by dr j. mccall, university of georgia)

was ground into a fine powder under liquid nitrogen and rna
extracted using the tripure isolation reagent (roche,
lewes, uk). the rna-containing aqueous phase was
precipitated by the addition of 0.5 vol.  xxxd2400xxx  and
incubation at 4 8c for 10 min. the rna was recovered by
centrifugation at 12,000 g for 10 min at 4 8c and the pellet
washed with 75% (v/v) ethanol before being resuspended in
0.5% (w/v) sds to give a final concentration of 1 mg/ml.
polya(þ ) mrna was isolated using the dynabeads mrna
purification kit (dynal, wirral, uk) following the manufacturer’s instructions. this was then used in a first strand cdna
synthesis reaction using superscript ii reverse transcriptase
(roche) and an oligo (dt)12 – 18-riro primer as described
previously (laughton et al., 1994). the reaction was
incubated at 42 8c for 50 min and the enzyme inactivated
by heating to 70 8c for 15 min. the rna template was
destroyed by the addition of two units escherichia coli
rnase h (promega, southampton, uk) followed by
incubation at 37 8c for 20 min. the cdna was then used
in pcrs using a ptc-100 thermal cycler (genetic research
instrumentation, essex, uk). for pcrs we used a programme consisting of a hot start for 2 min followed by 40
cycles of 94 8c for 30 s, x 8c (annealing temperature for
specific primers) for 30 s and 72 8c for 1 min. details of all
the primers used and the annealing temperatures are given in
table 1. pcr products were cloned into pcr-blunt ii-topo
using the zero blunt topo pcr cloning kit (invitrogen,
groningen, the netherlands) and the dna sequence
determined by the university of bath department of biology
and biochemistry genomic services unit.
a partial cdna sequence very similar to c. elegans avr14 had been previously isolated from d. immitis (cully et al.,
1996). this sequence was used to design oligonucleotide
primers for use in 50 and 30 rapid amplification of cdna
ends (race) reactions (frohman et al., 1988) using the sl1

the oligonucleotide primers and lines show the sequences amplified in each
reaction. the 50 cdna was amplified using the primers sl1 and 3di2/3p1
(50 race). the 30 cdna was amplified using the primers 5di2/3p1 and
rori (30 race). the full-length coding region was amplified from
d. immitis cdna using the primers sdg2 and asdg2.

(spliced leader 1) sequence as the 50 primer and a rori
sequence incorporated into the cdna synthesis primer at
the 30 end, as shown in fig. 1. a cdna clone including the
30 termination codon was obtained in a pcr using the
primers 5di2/3p1 and rori (30 race) and a cdna clone
containing the 50 initiation codon obtained in a pcr using
the primers 3di2/3p1 and sl1 (50 race). these two
overlapping clones were sequenced to give the full-length
nucleotide and amino-acid sequence of a glucla3 subunit.
using primers designed to this full-length sequence, a 1260nucleotide cdna corresponding to the predicted full-length
coding region was amplified using the primers sdg2 and
asdg2 (fig. 1).
2.2. functional expression of glucl in xenopus oocytes
full-length diglucla3a and a3b subunit cdnas were
amplified by pcr, using previously cloned pcr-blunt
ii-topo constructs as template dna, and cloned into
pcdna3.1(-) (invitrogen). the 50 primer used in each pcr
was designed to incorporate the 50 untranslated leader
sequence from the coat protein mrna of alfalfa mosaic
virus (50 -amv) just upstream of the start codon; this
sequence can be used to enhance translation efficiency of
mrna in xenopus oocytes (jobling and gehrke, 1987).
xba i and not i restriction sites were also incorporated into
the primers to facilitate cloning (table 1).
these recombinant plasmids were linearised and used to
generate a capped crna using the mmessage mmachine t7
kit (ambion, huntingdon, uk), following the manufacturers instructions. the reaction was incubated at 37 8c for
2 h and the dna template removed using dnase i (1 unit)
digestion for 15 min. the capped crna was extracted using
phenol:chloroform (1:1) and  xxxd2400xxx  precipitation. the
crna pellet was recovered by centrifugation at 20,000 g for
15 min at 4 8c and resuspended in nuclease-free water at a
concentration of 1 mg/ml.

ovarian tissue was removed from sexually mature
female xenopus laevis and the stages v and vi oocytes
prepared essentially as described (horoszok et al., 2001).
injection needles were pulled from 3.5 in. glass capillary
tubing (drummond scientific co., broomhall, pa, usa) on
a stationary coil narishige microelectrode puller (micro
instruments ltd, oxford, uk). needles were backfilled with
sterile  xxxd2648xxx  and attached to the plunger of a
drummond ‘nanoject’ microinjector. oocytes were
injected with either 50 ng of glucl crna or 50 nl of
nuclease-free water.
two-electrode voltage clamp recordings were made 2– 4
days after injection as described (horoszok et al., 2001).
the current injected to maintain the membrane potential
clamped at 2 80 mv was measured using pclamp8 (axon
instruments inc., union city, ca, usa) and data digitised
using a digidata 1322a axon instruments). ligands were
dissolved (l -glutamate) or diluted (ivermectin) in nd98
buffer (5 mm hepes, ph 7.5, 98 mm nacl, 1 mm mgcl2).
solid ivermectin (sigma, poole, uk) was dissolved in
 xxxd102xxx  and then diluted so that the final
concentration of ethanol was , 1% (v/v): this concentration
had no undesirable effects on the oocytes. a separate
perfusion and recording chamber was used for experiments
with ivermectin, and this was thoroughly washed with
 xxxd102xxx  between experiments.
3. results
3.1. the diglucla3 subunits
the 419 amino-acid polypeptide encoded by the first fulllength cdna we isolated exhibited greatest amino acid
identity (, 80%) to the c. elegans and h. contortus
glucla3a subunits and included all the characteristics of a
ligand-gated chloride channel subunit (fig. 2). we concluded
that it was a product of the d. immitis orthologue of the
c. elegans avr-14 (ce-avr-14) gene, di-avr-14. both the
ce-avr-14 and hc-avr-14 genes encode two glucla3
subunits and a feature of the c. elegans and h. contortus
glucla3a mrna nucleotide sequences is the presence of a
large apparent 30 untranslated region (utr) following the
stop codon (fig. 3), which appears to contain the coding
sequence for the c-terminal region of the glucla3b subunit
(laughton et al., 1997; jagannathan et al., 1999). the
predicted diglucla3a mrna sequence, as determined from
the overlapping 50 and 30 cdnas, did not contain a large 30
utr, suggesting that either d. immitis did not encode a
glucla3b subunit or that the pattern of splicing of di-avr-14
was different to that of ce-avr-14 and hc-avr-14. to examine
this, the 50 primer designed to the coding region of
diglucla3a (sdg2) was used in conjunction with the
rori primer in pcr; we predicted that both subunit
transcripts should be amplified if they had identical 50
sequences and also if the 30 utr was absent they should be of
a similar size. when these primers were used in an rt-pcr

fig. 2. alignment of the glucla3 subunit amino acid sequences from dirofilaria immitis, caenorhabditis elegans, haemonchus contortus and cooperia
oncophora. the diglucla3 subunits display the characteristic features of the ligand-gated ion channel (lgic) superfamily. these include the signature pair of
cysteine residues (highlighted in grey) within the n-terminal region and the four proposed transmembrane regions (m 1–4: underlined) in the c-terminal
region. a second pair of n-terminal cysteine residues (highlighted in black), diagnostic for the glucls and glycine receptors, are also conserved in these
subunits. as for other lgic subunits the diglucla3s have a proposed n-terminal signal peptide: in this case of 18 amino acids (in italics). they also possess a
highly conserved potential n-linked glycosylation site (denoted by the asterisk) and potential phosphorylation sites between m3-4 for protein kinases ((l)
protein kinase c; (s) camp dependent protein kinase). potential phosphorylation sites conserved across the three species shown are indicated above the
alignment for the a3a subunits and below it for the a3b sequences. amino-acid residues conserved in all a3a or a3b subunits are in bold.

reaction using total d.immitis mrna they amplified a
product of 1.5 kb. we screened a number of individual clones
containing this product by eco ri digestion, since a conserved
eco ri site is present in the c. elegans, h. contortus and
d. immitis glucla3a cdnas, but none of the glucla3b
ones. a single clone was isolated that lacked the eco ri site:
it was sequenced and found to include a full-length open
reading frame predicted to encode the diglucla3b subunit.
the coding region of this cdna was 1284 nucleotides,
encoding a predicted polypeptide of 427 amino acids (fig. 2).
the intracellular loops between membrane-spanning
regions m3 and m4 of ligand-gated ion channel subunits,

including the glucl (laughton et al., 1997; jagannathan
et al., 1999), possess several consensus sites for phosphorylation by various protein kinases and the d. immitis
glucla3 subunits are no exception. however, the presence
of orthologous sequences from four nematodes (fig. 2)
allowed us to look for potential phosphorylation sites that
are conserved across all four species. only two were found:
there is a consensus protein kinase c site just before m4 in
all the a3a and a3b subunits (position 464 on the alignment
shown in fig. 2) and a conserved consensus site for
phosphorylation by camp-dependent protein kinase in the
a3b subunits (position 403 in fig. 2). it is worth noting

fig. 3. comparison of the mrna generated following the alternative
splicing of the avr-14 genes in caenorhabditis elegans, haemonchus
contortus and dirofilaria immitis. coding regions are shown as boxes and
non-coding regions are shown as lines. in all three species the glucla3
mrnas encode common n-terminal glutamate-binding domains (speckled
boxes) attached to differing c-terminals (white and grey boxes), which
contain the transmembrane regions (numbered black boxes). in c. elegans
and h. contortus, within the large apparent 30 -utr of the glucla3a
mrna is the alternative c-terminal coding region (grey line), which is
spliced (indicated by the broken lines) to the common n-terminal coding
region to generate the glucla3b mrna. in both species the glucla3a and
a3b mrnas are ,2.1 and 1.5 kb in size, respectively. the large 30 -utr is
absent in the d. immitis glucla3a mrna leaving both subunit transcripts
of a similar size (,1.5 kb). presumably the 30 -utr is cleaved during
mrna processing in this species.

that in the h. contortus, c. oncophora and c. elegans
subunits, but not d. immitis, this second site also fulfils the
criteria for phosphorylation by casein kinase 2. phosphorylation of the m3:m4 loop of mammalian gabaa receptor
subunits has been associated with their trafficking to the
plasma membrane (kittler and moss, 2003) and it is
possible that the presence or absence of the glucla3
subunits at the plasma membrane may also be dependent on
such mechanisms.
3.2. expression of diglucla3 subunits in xenopus oocytes
previously it has been shown that the c. elegans
glucla3b and the c. oncophora glucla3 subunits could
form homomeric l -glutamate- and ivermectin-sensitive
channels when expressed in xenopus oocytes, while the
c. elegans glucla3a did not (dent et al., 2000; njue et al.,
2004). we have also demonstrated that the h. contortus
glucla3b subunit, but not the glucla3a subunit, forms
high-affinity ivermectin binding sites when expressed in a
mammalian cell line (cheeseman et al., 2001). attempts to
express the d. immitis glucla3 subunits in mammalian cell
lines were unsuccessful. we therefore injected full-length
capped crnas encoding both d. immitis subunits into
xenopus oocytes to determine whether they could form
channels in this system. as shown in fig. 4, l -glutamate and
ivermectin both induced inward currents in oocytes injected
with diglucla3b crna and voltage-clamped at 2 80 mv.
the l -glutamate-induced currents exhibited both a rapid
onset and rapid desensitisation and were fully reversible on

removal of the ligand. in contrast, the ivermectin-induced
currents had a very slow onset, did not desensitise and
remained even after extensive washing away of the ligand.
the currents induced by 1 mm ivermectin were also of
much greater amplitude (, 600 na) than those induced by
10 mm l -glutamate (, 100 na). no responses to l -glutamate (10 –100 mm) were observed in any oocytes injected
with the diglucla3a crna; the response to ivermectin
in these oocytes was not tested. no responses to 10 mm
l -glutamate or 1 mm ivermectin were observed in any
oocyte injected with water alone.

4. discussion
the filaria are extremely important parasites of humans
and animals and the a/ms form the cornerstone of many
programmes to control or eliminate them (molyneux et al.,
2003). however, the molecular basis of their anthelmintic
action and for the differences in the sensitivity of adult and
larval filarial to these drugs remains largely unknown. in
other nematode species, the glucl have been shown to be the
targets of the a/ms and so we initiated a project to clone and
express cdnas encoding glucl subunits from d. immitis.
we have shown that d. immitis possess a gene (di-avr14), orthologous to c. elegans and h. contortus avr-14. like

them, it encodes two glucla3 subunits, but the pattern of
alternative splicing of the filarial gene is slightly different in
that the 30 utr of the diglucla3a mrna does not contain
the coding sequences of the c-terminal half of the
diglucla3b subunit (fig. 3). this minor change in the
splicing pattern may reflect the greater phylogenetic
distance between d. immitis and the other two species
(blaxter et al., 1998). partial cdna sequences for glucla3
subunits have been reported from other filarial species
(cully et al., 1996), a. suum (jagannathan et al., 1999) and
c. oncophora (njue et al., 2004), so this gene is present in a
very wide range of nematodes.
the results of expressing the d. immitis subunits in
xenopus oocytes are consistent with those observed with
glucla3 subunits from other species. the c. elegans,
c. oncophora and h. contortus glucla3b subunits can form
l -glutamate- and ivermectin-sensitive channels when
expressed in eukaryotic cells (dent et al., 2000; cheeseman
et al., 2001; njue et al., 2004) and in the case of the
h. contortus subunit, the interaction is of a very high affinity
(cheeseman et al., 2001). the currents produced by
application of l -glutamate and ivermectin were very similar
to those observed for other glucl and did not suggest any
novel properties of the filarial receptors.
it is not clear why the glucla3a subunits do not form
functional channels or drug-binding sites. they are very
similar in sequence to the glucla3b subunits and there are
no obvious changes that would account for this difference.
one possibility is that the glucla3a subunits, when
expressed in the absence of other glucl subunits, cannot
assemble into functional receptors that are trafficked to the
cell surface. attempts to address this issue by transfecting
epitope-tagged versions of the d. immitis subunits into
mammalian cells were not successful, due to the very low
efficiency of transfection with these cdnas (data not
shown). this may be due to the extremely a:t rich
nucleotide composition of the d. immitis cdnas (rothstein
et al., 1988; fadiel et al., 2001). studies with h. contortus
have indicated that the two glucla3 subunits have only a
partially overlapping expression pattern (portillo et al.,
2003) and it seems likely that other subunits do assemble
with glucla3a: these remain to be discovered.
the glucla3 subunits are expressed widely in the
nematode nervous system (jagannathan et al., 1999; dent
et al., 2000; portillo et al., 2003), with a distribution that
could explain many of the effects of ivermectin (yates et al.,
2003). it thus seems that avr-14 genes are widely conserved
within the nematode phylum and that at least one of their
products, glucla3b, may be part of an important
avermectin target in filaria as well as other species. given
that the a/m anthelmintics are less effective at killing adult
filaria compared to larval stages, it will be interesting to
study the distribution of these subunits in d. immitis. it is
important to note that mrna used in our cloning experiments was obtained from adult females, which would
also have contained significant numbers of microfilariae.

the pool of mrna used for the original amplifications
would therefore have been derived from both ivermectinsensitive and -insensitive stages of the life cycle. in the
future, we need to compare the expression glucla3 subunits
in larval and adult worms and attempt to correlate
differences in anthelmintic sensitivity to these expression
patterns. such work should help to provide a better
understanding of how the a/ms prevent and control filarial
infection.
