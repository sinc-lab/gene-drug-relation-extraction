aim: to determine whether  xxxg599xxx  ( xxxg599xxx  receptor) is
involved in n-methyl-d-aspartate (nmda)-induced excitotoxic injury in the mouse
brain. methods: brain injury was induced by nmda microinjection (50–150 nmol
in 0.5 µl) into the cerebral cortex. the changes in  xxxg599xxx  receptor expression
24 h after nmda injection and the effects of a  xxxg599xxx  receptor antagonist,
 xxxd2995xxx  (0.01 and 0.1 mg/kg), an nmda receptor antagonist, ketamine (30
mg/kg), and an antioxidant,  xxxd1964xxx  (9 mg/kg) were observed. results: in the
nmda-injured brain, the  xxxg599xxx  receptor mrna, and protein expression were
upregulated, and the receptor was mainly localized in the neurons and not in the
astrocytes.  xxxd2995xxx , ketamine and  xxxd1964xxx  decreased nmda-induced injury;
 xxxd2995xxx  (0.1 mg/kg) and ketamine inhibited the upregulated expression of the
cyslt 1 receptor. conclusion: cyslt 1 receptor expression in neurons is
upregulated after nmda injection, and nmda-induced responses are inhibited
by  xxxg599xxx  receptor antagonists, indicating that the increased  xxxg599xxx  receptor is
involved in nmda excitotoxicity.

introduction
excitotoxicity, one important determinant in various diseases of the central nervous system (cns), is involved in
acute ischemic brain injury[1–3] and can initiate postischemic
inflammation by inducing the expression of pro-inflammatory molecules/mediators[4–6]. mediators in postischemic inflammation include  xxxg147xxx  ( xxxg147xxx ) metabolites eg,
cysteinyl leukotrienes (cyslt, including ltc4, ltd4 and
lte4)[7–11]. we have recently indicated that in cultured rat
primary neurons, in vitro ischemic-like injury induces endogenous excitatory amino acid (glutamate) release; the released glutamate activates  xxxg147xxx  via the n-methyl-d-aspartate
(nmda) receptor to produce cyslt, which then induce neuron responses[12]. these findings show one aspect of the
interaction between  xxxg147xxx /cyslt and excitotoxicity.
however, as another aspect, whether the  xxxg147xxx  metabolites,
cyslt, modulate excitotoxicity is still not clear.
the actions of cyslt are mediated by stimulating their
receptors. the cloned cyslt receptors consist of 2 subtypes:
cyslt 1 and cyslt 2 receptors; both of them g-protein
1526

coupled receptors[13]. the human  xxxg599xxx  receptor is localized in the airway of smooth muscle cells, lung macrophages,
mast cells, eosinophils and mononuclear cells as detected
by in situ hybridization or immunohistochemistry[14,15]. we
have recently reported that cyslt 1 receptor is primarily
expressed in cerebral microvascular endothelial cells, and
the expression is induced in the neuron- and glial-appearing
cells after traumatic injury[16]. moreover,  xxxg599xxx  receptor
antagonists,  xxxd2995xxx  ( xxxd2995xxx ) and montelukast, possess neuroprotective effects on focal cerebral ischemia in
rats and mice[17–20]. these findings indicate the involvement
of the  xxxg599xxx  receptor in brain injury. in addition, we found
that  xxxd2995xxx  protected against global cerebral ischemia in
rats and inhibited the increased expression of the nmda
receptor subunit  xxxg964xxx , suggesting an interaction between
cyslt 1 and nmda receptors[19]. as indirect evidence,
 xxxd2995xxx  attenuates brain injury induced by nmda microinjection into rat cortex, suggesting that the  xxxg599xxx  receptor
may modulate nmda-induced neurotoxicity[21]. however,
since the  xxxg599xxx  receptor is not expressed in the neurons in
a normal brain [16], this modulation should be proven by

direct evidence.
to determine whether and how the  xxxg599xxx  receptor is
involved in excitotoxicity, we induced brain injury by nmda
(one of the exogenous excitatory amino acids) microinjection in the cortex. then we observed  xxxg599xxx  receptor expression and the effect of  xxxd2995xxx , a selective antagonist
of  xxxg599xxx  receptor, in mice. an nmda receptor antagonist,
ketamine, and an antioxidant with neuroprotective effect for
cerebral ischemia,  xxxd1964xxx  ( xxxd1964xxx , 3-methyl-1-phenyl2-pyrazolin-5-one)[22,23], were used as controls.

materials and methods
materials  xxxd2995xxx  ( xxxd2995xxx ) was kindly provided
by dr masami tsuboshima (ono pharmaceutical co,
osaka, japan); nmda and 2,3,5-triphenylterazolium chloride (ttc) were purchased from sigma (st louis, mo, usa);
 xxxd1964xxx  was obtained from hangzhou conba pharmaceutical co (hangzhou, china); ketamine was purchased from
shanghai bio-chem co (shanghai, china); trizol for extracting rna was from bio basic inc (mississauga, ontario,
canada); chemicals for rt-pcr were from takara co (kyoto,
japan); polyclonal rabbit anti-human  xxxg599xxx  antibody was
purchased from cayman chemicals (ann arbor, mi, usa);
mouse monoclonal antibodies against neuronal nuclei (neun)
and  xxxg883xxx  (gfap) and fitc-conjugated goat anti-rabbit igg and cy3-conjugated goat antimouse igg were from chemicon (temecula, california, usa);
cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells (ea.hy926
cells) were provided by dr cora-jean s edgell (university
of north carolina, usa) and human neuroblastoma sk-nsh cells were purchased from the institute of cell biology,
chinese academy of sciences (shanghai, china); biotinylated goat anti-rabbit igg was purchased from zhongshan
biotech co (beijing, china). other reagents were commercial products with analytic purity.
nmda microinjection male kunming mice weighing
25–30 g were purchased from the shanghai experimental
animal center (shanghai, china; certificate no 22-001004).
the mice were housed under controlled temperature
(22±1 °c), 12 h light/12 h dark cycle and allowed free access
to food and water. all the experiments were carried out in
accordance with the national institute of health guide for
the care and use of laboratory animals.
the mice were anesthetized with an intraperitoneal injection of chloral hydrate (400 mg/kg) and immobilized on a
stereotaxic frame (sr-5, narishige, tokyo, japan). the dura
overlying the parietal cortex was exposed, and nmda
[50–150 nmol in 0.5 µlof sterile 0.1 mol/l phosphate buff-

ding q et al

ered solution (pbs), ph 7.4] or pbs (0.5 µl) alone was
injected with a microinjector into the parietal cortex at a site
1.5 mm caudal to the bregma, 4.0 mm from the midline and
0.8 mm below the dural surface[24]. injections were made
over a period of 8 min, and the microinjector was left in place
for an additional 10 min to minimize the back-flux of nmda
and then removed. the rectal temperature was maintained
at 37.0±0.5 °c with a heating pad and a heating lamp during
the surgical procedure. after the surgery, the mice were kept
in a recovery box with heating lamps to maintain body temperature and then returned to their cages.
to observe the effects of the agents, the mice were intraperitoneally injected with  xxxd2995xxx  (0.01 and 0.1 mg/kg),
ketamine (30 mg/kg),  xxxd1964xxx  (9 mg/kg), and saline (control)
at 30 min before and 30 min after nmda injection.
histopathological examination the mice were anesthetized with chloral hydrate and decapitated 24 h after nmda
or pbs injection. the brains were quickly removed and cut
into 1 mm-thick coronal slices. the slices were stained with
0.5% 2,3,5-triphenylterazolium chloride (ttc) at 37 °c for 30
min in the dark and then fixed by 10% buffered formalin. the
stained slices with the caudal facing upwards were photographed with a digital camera (panasonic cp 230, matsushita,
fukuoka, japan) and recorded in a computer. the regions
completely lacking ttc-staining were defined as tissue
lesions. the lesion and hemisphere area of each slice were
quantified using an image analysis program (aanlypower
1.0, zhejiang university, hangzhou, china). the total lesion
volume for each brain was calculated by summation of the
corrected lesion volumes [lesion area×thickness (1 mm)] of
all slices as described by lin et al[25]. hemispheric swelling
representing brain edema was indirectly determined as the
percentage increase of the lesioned hemisphere volume.
in another series, the mice were anesthetized with chloral
hydrate and then perfused transcardially with 4% paraformaldehyde after pre-washing with saline. the brains were
removed, post-fixed in the same fixative and embedded in
paraffin; 5 µm or 8 µm-thick coronal sections were cut by
cryomicrotomy (cm1900, leica, wetzlar, germany). then
the 5 µm-thick sections were stained with hematoxylin and
eosin (h&e) for light microscopic examination. the densities of the neurons in the cortex and hippocampal ca1 regions (1.8–2.0 mm caudal from bregma) were counted using
the image analysis program described above.
rt-pcr the brain tissues (from the region 0.5–2.5 mm
caudal from bregma and the corresponding region of the
contralateral hemisphere) were dissected on ice and the total
rna was extracted from the tissue samples using trizol
reagents according to the manufacture’s protocol. rna

purity and yield were determined by uv spectrophotometry
(bio-rad smart spec 3000, hercules, ca, usa). for cdna
synthesis, aliquots of total rna (2 µg) were mixed with 0.2
µg random hexamer primer, 20 u rnasin, 1 mmol/l dntp and
200 u m-mulv reverse transcriptase in 20 µl of the reverse
reaction buffer. the mixture was incubated at 42 °c for 60
min and then at 72 °c for 10 min to inactivate the reverse
transcriptase. as a negative control, the reaction was performed with the absence of the reverse transcriptase.
the rt-cdna temple (1 µl) underwent pcr (bio-rad,
usa) in a 20 µl reaction mixture containing 1×pcr buffer,
200 µmol/l dntp, 1.5 mmol/l mgcl2, 20 pmol of each primer
and 0.5 u of taq dna polymerase. cycling parameters were
as follows: 94 °c for 2 min, followed by 33 cycles of 94 °c for
30 s, 63 °c for 30 s and 72 °c for 30 s, with a final extension
step of 72 °c for 10 min. the primer pairs for the mouse
 xxxg599xxx  receptor were derived from the published cdna sequence[26] and synthesized by sangon biotech co (shanghai,
china): 5'-caa cga act atc cac ctt cacc-3' as sense
and 5'-agc ctt ctc cta aag ttt ccac-3' as antisense.
the primers for  xxxg53xxx  were 5'-gtc gta cca cag gca
ttg tga tgg-3' as sense and 5'-gca atg cct ggg tac
atg  xxxg889xxx -3' as antisense. the product sizes were 164 bp
and 490 bp, respectively. the pcr products in 10 µl were
separated by electrophoresis on a 2% agarose gel containing ethidium bromide and photographed. the optical density of the bands was determined by an image analysis system (bio-rad, usa). the amount of  xxxg599xxx  receptor mrna
was calculated as the ratio over  xxxg53xxx .
 xxxg599xxx  receptor specific immunohistochemical analysis to confirm the specificity of the polyclonal rabbit antihuman  xxxg599xxx  receptor antibody used in the immunohistochemical staining of mouse brain tissues, we collected protein samples from normal mouse brains as well as from the
cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells (ea.hy926
cells) and human neuroblastoma sk-n-sh cells for western
blotting analysis. the mouse brain samples were homogenized and cell samples were sonicated in lysis buffer. the
lysates were then centrifuged at 15 000×g at 4 °c for 30 min
and the supernatant was used. protein samples (50 µg) were
separated by 10% sds-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis
and transferred to the nitrocellulose membranes. then, the
membranes were blocked by 5% bovine  xxxg124xxx  (bsa)
and reacted with a rabbit polyclonal antibody against the
 xxxg599xxx  receptor (1:2000) and peroxidase-conjugated goat
anti-rabbit igg (1:2000) after repeated washing. finally, the
protein bands were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence.
immunohistochemical detection of the  xxxg599xxx  receptor
1528

was performed on 8 µm-thick coronal sections (1.8–2.0 mm
caudal from bregma). after 3 washes with pbs, the sections
were incubated with 0.3%  xxxd2298xxx  in methanol at
room temperature for 30 min to block the reactivity of endogenous peroxidase. the sections were washed several times
in the pbs, pre-incubated with 5% normal goat serum for 2 h
to reduce non-specific staining, and then reacted with the
polyclonal rabbit anti-human cyslt 1 receptor antibody
(1:150) overnight at 4 oc. control sections were treated with
normal goat serum instead of the primary antibody. after
repeated washing in pbs, the sections were reacted for 1 h
with the secondary antibody (1:200), biotinylated goat antirabbit igg, followed by reaction for 1 h with avidin-biotinhorseradish peroxidase complex (1:200). finally, the sections were exposed for 2–5 min to 0.05% 3,3'-diaminobenzidine
and 0.03%  xxxd2298xxx  and examined by a light microscope (olympus bx51, olympus, tokyo, japan).
to visualize the localization of the  xxxg599xxx  receptor in
different cell types, double immunofluorescence was
employed. briefly, non-specific binding of igg was blocked
with 5% normal goat serum for 2 h at room temperature; each
section was incubated overnight at 4 °c with a mixture of
rabbit polyclonal antibody against the  xxxg599xxx  receptor and
mouse monoclonal antibodies against neun (a specific
marker of neurons) or gfap (a specific marker of astrocytes).
then, the sections were incubated with the mixture of fitcconjugated goat anti-rabbit igg and cy3-conjugated goat
anti-mouse igg and observed under a fluorescence microscope (olympus bx51, japan).
statistical analysis all values are presented as mean±sd.
one-way anova (student-newman-keuls) was performed
for statistical analysis using the spss software package
(version 10.0 for windows; spss, chicago, illinois, usa).
p<0.05 was considered statistically significant.

nmda-induced brain injury is similar to ketamine and

 xxxg599xxx  receptor mrna expression after nmda microinjection nmda (100 and 150 nmol) significantly increased
the expression of the  xxxg599xxx  receptor mrna, in the injured

(p<0.05 or 0.01; figure 3a, 3d), but nmda at 50 nmol did
not significantly affect the expression (data not shown).

inhibited nmda (150 nmol)-increased expression of the

this effect (p>0.05; figure 3f). otherwise, in the corresponding contralateral region, the expression of the  xxxg599xxx  receptor mrna was not changed (figure 3e). this result indicated that nmda increased the expression of the  xxxg599xxx 
receptor mrna, which was inhibited by the nmda receptor antagonist ketamine and the  xxxg599xxx  receptor antagonist,
 xxxd2995xxx , but not by the antioxidant  xxxd1964xxx .

distribution of the  xxxg599xxx  receptor immunopositive cells
after nmda microinjection western blotting analysis confirmed the specificity of a polyclonal rabbit anti-human
 xxxg599xxx  receptor antibody used in the mouse brain because
the same bands were found in the mouse brain samples and
the samples from cultured human umbilical vein endothelial
cells (ea.hy926 cells) or human neuroblastoma sk-n-sh cells
(figure 4e). the band was closed to 43 kda, which was
consistent with previously published results using the same
polyclonal antibody[27,28]. using the antibody, we detected
the distribution of  xxxg599xxx  receptor protein 24 h after nmda
(150 nmol) microinjection by immunohistochemistry. the
result showed that  xxxg599xxx -positive cells were significantly
increased in the cortex and hippocampal ca1 region after
nmda excitotoxic damage (figure 4a–4d), but not in the
hippocampal ca3 or dg region.  xxxd2995xxx  (0.1 mg/kg) and
ketamine (30 mg/kg) reduced cyslt 1-positive cells, but
 xxxd1964xxx  (9 mg/kg) did not show this effect (figure 4a–
4d). to determine whether the increased expression of the
 xxxg599xxx  receptor is distributed in neurons or astrocytes, we

performed double immunofluorescence. the result showed
that  xxxg599xxx  receptor immunoreactivity was mainly localized
in neun-positive neurons in the nmda (150 nmol)-injected
cortex and hippocampal ca1 region (figure 5). however, no
apparent change was found in gfap-positive astrocytes;
the  xxxg599xxx  receptor was much less expressed in the astrocytes (figure 6).

discussion
the most important finding in the present study is that
the  xxxg599xxx  receptor is involved in brain excitotoxicity. this
involvement is evidenced by the upregulation of the  xxxg599xxx 
receptor after nmda microinjection and the attenuation of
nmda insult by a  xxxg599xxx  receptor antagonist,  xxxd2995xxx .
therefore, our study shows a possible interaction between
the excitotoxicity and the inflammation related to cyslt in
the brain.
our immunohistochemical results indicate that  xxxg599xxx 
receptor expression is induced by nmda microinjection and

mainly localized in the neurons, but not in the astrocytes in
the injured regions. this finding is consistent with those of
our recent studies. we found that the  xxxg599xxx  receptor was
primarily distributed in microvascular endothelial cells in the
human brain, and an inducible expression was detected in
the neuron- and glial-appearing cells in the brain specimens
from patients with brain trauma or tumors[16]. in rats and
mice with focal cerebral ischemia,  xxxg599xxx  receptor expression was largely increased in the ischemic core 24 h after
1532

ischemia, and the increased expression was mainly localized
in neun-positive neurons and much less in gfap-positive
astrocytes (unpublished data). these findings suggest that
the  xxxg599xxx  receptor may mediate various brain injuries, such
as trauma, ischemia and tumors, as well as chemically-induced excitotoxicity in the present study.
interestingly, the increased  xxxg599xxx  receptor expression
induced by nmda is not only inhibited by the nmda receptor antagonist, ketamine, but also by the  xxxg599xxx  recep-

tor antagonist,  xxxd2995xxx . since none of the agents affect
the expression of a  xxxg599xxx  receptor mrna, in the contralateral brain region from the nmda-treated mice, it can be excluded that ketamine or  xxxd2995xxx  directly inhibits the
expression. inhibition by ketamine reasonably results from
the blockage of nmda actions. however, why  xxxd2995xxx 
also inhibits cyslt 1 receptor expression is unclear. one
possible explanation might be that attenuation of brain
injury by  xxxd2995xxx  may secondarily reduce  xxxg599xxx  receptor expression; however, this explanation is not supported
by the effect of  xxxd1964xxx  that attenuated nmda-induced
injury, but did not inhibit the expression. another explanation might be that this phenomenon may be a special effect
of cyslt 1 receptor antagonists. we have found that
montelukast, another  xxxg599xxx  receptor antagonist, also inhibited  xxxg599xxx , but not cyslt2 receptor mrna expression
in the lungs with eosinophilic inflammation from asthmatic

mice[29]. because  xxxg1180xxx  ( xxxg1180xxx ) upregulates  xxxg599xxx 
receptor expression[30] and  xxxd2995xxx  inhibits  xxxg1180xxx  production [29,31], inhibition of cyslt 1 receptor expression by
 xxxd2995xxx  might result from its effect on upregulation by  xxxg1180xxx .
among the agents used in the present study, ketamine is
applied to confirm nmda receptor activation,  xxxd2995xxx  is
to confirm  xxxg599xxx  receptor activation, and  xxxd1964xxx  is to
distinguish the differences from  xxxd2995xxx . ketamine is a
potent non-competitive nmda receptor antagonist that has
been shown to protect neurons from excitotoxic injury after
cerebral ischemia[32,33], trauma[34] or injection of excitotoxins[35,36].
in the present study, the inhibition of all the responses to
nmda by ketamine confirmed that nmda-induced
responses are mediated by nmda receptor activation, similar to the reported results[36,37]. for the effect of  xxxd2995xxx ,

the experiments of cerebral ischemia [17,18,20]. the results
showed dose-dependency; only 0.1 mg/kg exerts effect on
brain injury. in addition,  xxxd1964xxx  ( xxxd1964xxx , 3-methyl-1phenyl-2-pyrazolin-5-one) is a clinically available neuroprotective agent for the treatment of stroke with activity reducing free radicals[22,23,38,39]. we found that  xxxd1964xxx  had a
different effect from  xxxd2995xxx ; it attenuated nmdainduced brain injury, similar to its neuroprotective effect on
cerebral ischemia[23,38,39], but did not affect  xxxg599xxx  receptor
expression. therefore, this difference supports that the
effect of  xxxd2995xxx  on  xxxg599xxx  receptor expression might be
special.
excitotoxicity is a common injurious factor involved in
many cns diseases including cerebral ischemia. the present
study indicates one aspect of the interaction between
excitotoxicity and  xxxg147xxx /cyslt pathway: the  xxxg599xxx  recep1534

tor is upregulated and plays a role in excitotoxicity. as another aspect, we recently found that  xxxg147xxx  was upregulated
by excitotoxicity[12]. taken together, excitotoxicity initiates
post-injury inflammation by enhancing both pro-inflammatory molecules (like  xxxg147xxx ) and inflammatory responses (like
strengthening the action of cyslt).
