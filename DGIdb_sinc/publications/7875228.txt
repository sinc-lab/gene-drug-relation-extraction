abstract

norepinephrine (10 #m),  xxxd2601xxx  (100/xm) and clonidine (100/~m) with  xxxd2247xxx  (gtp, 50 #m) or
guanosine 5'-o-(3-thiotriphosphatc) (gtpt-s, 10 #m) all significantly enhanced the contraction induced by 0.3 ~m ca 2+
(pca6.5) in /3-escin-skinned smooth muscle of rabbit thoracic aorta. the enhancement of ca 2+ contraction produced by
norepinephrine was greater than that produced by  xxxd2601xxx  or clonidine. in /3-escin-skinned strips of chloroethylclonidinepretreated smooth muscle, the enhancement of ca z+ contraction produced by norepincphrine was significantly decreased,
whereas the amplitude was the same as that produced by mcthoxamine or clonidine; this enhancement was inhibited by the
selective ala-adrenoceptor antagonist wb 4101 (100 nm). the enhancement of ca :+ contraction produced by  xxxd2601xxx  and
clonidine was not affected by chloroethylclonidine pretreatment, the effects of  xxxd2601xxx , clonidinc and norepinephrinc in
the chloroethylclonidine-pretreated tissue were all inhibited by guanosine 5'-o-(2-thiodiphosphate) (gdp/3-s, 1 ram) and
l-(5-isoquinolinylsulfonyl)-methylpiperazine (h-7, 20/zm). furthermore, the phosphorylation of myosin light chain produced by
norepinephrine was greater than that produced by clonidine. these results suggest that both a~-adrenoceptor subtypes (a~a and
a~b) increase the ca 2+ sensitivity of contractile elements, and that the ca 2+ sensitization produced by a~a-subtype receptors is
mediated through g-protein and protein kinase c, and plays an important role in contraction of smooth muscle of rabbit
thoracic aorta.

1. introduction

in vascular smooth muscle, receptor agonists increase muscle tension and cytosolic ca 2+ concentrations ([ca2+]i). there are several lines of evidence
obtained with the aid of ca 2+ indicators (fura-2 or
aequoline) which indicate the variable relationship between force and [ c a 2 + ] i. examination of t h e [ca2+]itension relationship showed that a l - a d r e n o c e p t o r agonists such as norepinephrine, phenylephrine and clonidine, and phorbol esters like 12-deoxyphorbol 13-isobutyrate induce greater contractions than high k +
does (defeo and morgan, 1985; karaki et ai., 1988;
karaki, 1989; takayanagi and onozuka, 1990). it has
also been shown that phorbol esters, which activate
protein kinase c, can induce contraction of vascular

smooth muscle without changing [ca2+]i (jiang and
morgan, 1987). recent reports in which permeabilized
smooth muscle preparations were used have provided
direct evidence that norepinephrine and phenylephrine
augment muscle tension at a fixed concentration of
ca 2+ (hirata et al., 1992; nishimura et al., 1988; kitazawa et al., 1989, 1991). this suggests that the enhancement of ca :+ sensitivity of contractile elements
is due to activation of receptors and protein kinase c.
in addition to these findings, two major subtypes (c~ja
and aj~) of a l - a d r e n o c e p t o r have been identified in
pharmacological studies (gross et al., 1989; han et ai.,
1987; minneman et al., 1988; satoh et al., 1992a,b;
takayanagi and moriya, 1991). the a~a subtype has a
higher affinity for the competitive antagonists, wb
4101, 5-methylurapidil, p h e n t o l a m i n e and ( + ) niguldipine, and is insensitive to irreversible inactivation by an alkylating analog of clonidine, chloroethylclonidine (boer et al., 1989; gross et al., 1989; han et

al., 1987; minneman et al., 1988; morrow and creese,
1986). a number of investigators have reported the
existence of two pharmacologically distinct (xla- and
~tb-adrenoceptor subtypes in vascular smooth muscle
of the rabbit (boer et al., 1989; satoh et al., 1992a,b:
suzuki et al., 1990; takayanagi et al., 1991). in our
previous reports, we also stated that these two distincl
a~-adrenoceptor subtypes exist in thoracic aorta of
rabbit (takayanagi et al., 1991; satoh et al., 1992a,b),
and that the full agonist norepinephrine induces contraction through both subtypes but that the partial
agonist clonidine acts only through the ~y~,\ subtype
(takayanagi et al., 1991; satoh et ai., 1992b). this
suggests that the pharmacological characterization of
responses differs for ezra- and (fib subtypes. as tsujimoto et al. (1989) and han et al. (1987) have also
shown, these subtypes are coupled to different signal
transduction mechanisms.
smooth muscle contraction is initiated by phosphorylation of the 2000(i da myosin light chain by ca ~'+calmodulin-dependent myosin light chain kinase (hai
and murphy, 1989). this ca2+-ealmodulin-depcndent
phosphorylation of myosin light chain by myosin light
chain kinase and its dephosphorylation by myosin light
chain phosphatase are important regulatory mechanisms (trybus and lowey, 1985). although numerous
experiments have investigated the pharmacology of receptors, few attempts have yet been made to investigate the role of ~tradrenoceptor subtypes (oe~.\ and
aib) in the regulation and modulation of ca ~ ~ sensitivity and myosin light chain phosphorylation in contraction of wtscular smooth muscle.
to clarify the possible function of o~t-adrenoceptor
subtypes (a't, , and alb) on the ca ~'~ sensitivity of
smooth muscle contraction, we here investigated the
effects of subtype-selective agents and a protein kinase
c inhibitor on the contraction induced by ca 2~ in
chemically skinned smooth muscle; myosin light chain
phosphory, lation as a result of stimulation of ef~-adrenoceptor subtypes in vascular smooth muscle was also
measured. we present evidence that g-protein and
protein kinase c are inw)lved in this ca 2+ sensitivity.

2. materials and methods

wide, parallel to the circular smooth muscle bundles.
the tissues were treated with 100 # m chloroethylclonidine tot a total of 6(t rnin; following the initial
application, this antagonist was reapplied every ill rain
to awfid decomposition of the drug in the solution.
since /3-haloethylamincs are unstable in aqueous solulion. the strips were then allowed to re-equilibrate for
60 min with washing every 10 min.
2.2. s k i n n i n g procedure

the skinning of bundles was achievcd by incubation
at 22-25°c in 100 # m /~-escin in the relaxing solution
for 20 rain (kitazawa and somlyo, 199(i; kobayashi et
al., 1989). single bundles of aortic smooth muscle were
then incubated in relaxing solution, which was composed of (in ram): k-propionate, 130: mgci,, 4.0:
tris-maleate (at ph 6.8), 20.(i; egta, 2.0: adenosine
5'-triphosphate (atp) (at ph 6.8), 2.0: and creatinc
phosphate, 5.(}. this solution also containcd creatine
phosphokinase 10 u / m l , calmodulin 2.7 "am, carbonylcyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazine (fccp) 1
,am as a mitochondrial blocker, 6s-[6o~(2s,3s),813(r),

undec-2-yl]methyl]-4-benzoxazolecarboxylic acid (a231
87) 10 ,am as a ca 2+ ionophore, e-64 1 ,am and
leupeptin 1 # m as a protease inhibitor. when bundles
werc contracted by ca -'+ after skinning, solutions of
pca6.5 and 5.0 were prepared by using ca e ~-e(}ta
buffer of 2 mm e g t a and the corresponding concentration of ca 2~ the required ca :~ concentrations

ph 6.8 (saida and nonomura, 1978).
2.3. m e a s u r e m e n t o[ c a : ~ contraction

the bundles were mounted in tile experimental
chamber (20(t "al volume) and stretched to about 1.2
times their resting length. isometric tension was measured with a force transducer (ul-2gr; minebea co.,
japan). in the analysis of the ca -~ sensitivity induced
by norepinephrine and clonidinc in the presence of 50
"am gtp, measurements were made after the sustained contraction had reached a constant tcnsion.

2.4. m e a s u r e m e n t o[" myosin light chain phosl#u~tylation

male albino rabbits weighing 2.0-3.0 kg were killed
by bleeding from the neck. the thoracic aorta was
quickly removed and dissected free of excess fat and
connective tissue in oxygenated krebs solution of the
following composition (in mm):  xxxg2020xxx , 118; mgci 2, 1.2;
cac12, 2.5: k h : p o 4, 1.2; n a h c o 3, 25; and glucose,
11 dissolved in distilled water (ph = 7.4 at 37°c). the
entire aorta was cut into single strips about 100 "am

myosin light chain phosphorylation in rabbit thoracic aorta was measured by the method of o'farrell el
al. (1975) as modified by sato e t a [ . (1992). strips of
rabbit thoracic aorta were frozen in acetone-dry ice.
muscle strips were crushed and mixed with 60 volntncs
of pyrophosphate buffer containing 100 mm nap:o~, 5
mm egta, 2.5 mm dithiothrcitol, 0.5 mm phcnyl-

methylsulfonyl fluoride, 50 mm naf, 0.6 m ki and
10% ( w / v ) glycerol at ph 8.8. after a 5-min incubation
at 0°c, the mixture was centrifuged for 20 min at
5000 x g. the sample was then centrifuged for 20 min
at 5000 × g and the supernatant was analyzed. we also
used two-dimensional electrophoresis (isoelectric focusing, ief; sodium  xxxd3215xxx -polyacrylamide gel
electrophoresis, sds-page) to assess myosin light
chain phosphorylation. muscle strips were frozen and
crushed as described previously and suspended in 8.5
m urea, 2% pharmalyte (a mixture of 4 volumes of ph
4-6.5 pharmalyte and 1 volume of 3 - 1 0 pharmalytc).

40 mm dithiothreito[ and 1% sds. two-dimensional
electrophoresis was performed as described by o'farrel (1975). proteins were visualized by a highly sensitive
silver staining method (oakley et al., 1980). the optical
density of the unphosphorylated and phosphorylated
myosin light chains was measured by scanning dcnsitometry.

of 1 0 / x m norepinephrine, 100 /xm  xxxd2601xxx  and
100 p,m clonidine on the contraction induced by pca6.5
were measured in the presence of calmodulin, a23187
and g t p (fig. 1b, c and d), although application of
each of the agonists alone did not induce a contractile
response. the contraction induced by pca6.5 increased
in the presence of the ala- and a ~ - a d r e n o c e p t o r
agonist norepinephrine (fig. 1b) and its magnitude,
expressed as a percentage of the maximum amplitude
of contraction induced by 10 # m ca 2+ (pca5.0), increased from 24.9 + 5.30 to 56.9 _+ 5.57 (table 1). to
measure the ca 2+ sensitivity to norepinephrine, represented by the amplitude of contraction induced by
pca6.5 in the presence of norepinephrine vs. that in its
absence, the ratio (norepinephrine + pca6.5)/pca6.5
was used, which was significantly different from unity
(2.45 _+ 0.30, n = 3). ca 2+ sensitivity was also measured
in experiments with the c~a-adrenoceptor agonists,

the selective a~a-adrenoceptor antagonist wb4101
(100 nm) inhibited the ca 2+ sensitization produced by
norepinephrine in the chloroethylclonidine-pretreated
tissue (fig. 1h), and the ratio, (norepinephrinc +
pca6.5)/pca6.5, was similar to unity (1.02 _ 0.02, n =
3) (table 2). the nonhydrolyzable g d p analog,
gdp/3-s, and the potent protein kinase c inhibitor
(hidaka et al., 1984), h-7 (20 /xm), also inhibited the
ca 2+ sensitization produced by norepinephrine in the
chloroethylclonidine-pretreated tissue (fig. 1i and j).

3.4. effects of norepinephrine and clonidine on myosin
light chain phosphorylation in rabbit thoracic aorta
the application of 10/xm norepinephrine produced
myosin light chain phosphorylation in rabbit thoracic
aorta; at 2 min the response was maximal (45.2 + 1.7,
n = 4) (fig. 2). application of 100 /_tm clonidine also
increased myosin light chain phosphorylation (24.8 _+
4.4, n = 4), although the extent of phosphorylation was
less than that produced by norepinephrine.

4. discussion

a major advantage of permeabilizing smooth muscles with the saponin ester/3-escin is that this method,
unlike saponin permeabilization, leaves plasma membrane receptors coupled to their effector systems, while
allowing rigorous control of the ca 2+ concentration
with egta. the new findings of this study are that the
ca 2+ sensitivity of the contraction induced by a constant cytoplasm pca6.5 was increased through both
~i'ia- and ajb-adrenoceptor subtypes activated by norepinephrine (10/xm), but only by the ala subtype after
activation by  xxxd2601xxx  (100/xm) or clonidine (100
# m ) in /3-escin-skinned vascular smooth muscle of
rabbit thoracic aorta. with tissue pretreated with
chloroethylclonidine, an a'lb-adrenoccptor-alkylating
agent, the ca 2+ sensitization produced by norepinephrine was similar to that produced by  xxxd2601xxx  and
clonidine, which was not affected by the chloroethylclonidine pretreatment. the ca 2 + sensitization through
the o/ia subtype was inhibited by the nonhydrolyzable
gdp analog, gdp/3-s (1 mm), and by the protein
kinase c inhibitor, h-7 (20 #m), suggesting that the
ca 2+ sensitization of contraction is produced through
g-proteins and protein kinase c. in the intact tissue,

the myosin light chain phosphorylation produced by
both rfl\ and t~t~~ subtypes was greater than that
produced by the a l ~ subtype alone, suggesting that this
regulation and modulation is produced through c~tadrcnoceptor subtypes. although some experiments
with permeabilized smooth muscle have demonstrated
the mechanisms and modulation of contraction mediated by ~l-adrenoceptors (crichton and smith, 1990:
himpcns el al., 1990; hirata et al., 1992), there is no
evidence of ca =+ sensitization produced by at-adrenoccptor subtypes (~l,\ and c ~ ) and their pharmacological mechanisms.
in the present experiments, we observed that the
amplitudc of the pca6.5-induced contraction sensitized
by norepinephrine was greater (2.45 + 0.30, n - 3) than
that obtained by  xxxd2601xxx  (1.43 + 0.16, n - 3) or
clonidinc (1.50+0.17, n = 3 ) , whcn only the {~l.,\adrenoceptor subtype was activated. further, in the
chloroethylclonidine-pretreated tissue, the amplitude
of the cnhancement produced by norepinephrine was
similar (1.47 + 0.04, n = 3) to that of methoxaminc
(1.42+().18, n - 3 ) or chmidine (1.46+_0.08, 11 3).
these observations support the evidence reportcd by
somc investigators (satoh et al., 1992a,b; suzuki et al.,
1990: takayanagi and onozuka, 1990: takayanagi et
al., 1991; tsujimoto et al., 1989) that two pharmacologically distinct c,l-adrenoccptor subtypes (al..x and
a'~l~) in rabbit thoracic aorta utilize different signal
transduction mechanisms, and both these subtypes enhance the ca e- sensitization of the contraction of
wiscular smooth muscle. in addition, the selective ~..xadrenoccptor antagonist wb41[)i eliminated the enhancement produced by norcpincphrine in chlorocthylclonidine-pretreated tissue, in which only {~ta subtypes
are functional, and gdp/3-s eliminated it. thus thc
ca='-sensitizing action exerted by ~ a - a d r c n o c e p t o r
subtypes appears to be mediated by g-proteins. fujiwara et al. (1989) observed the enhancing effects of
gtpt-s, a stable gtp analog, on smooth muscle tissue of thc rabbit mesenteric artery and concluded that
this agent increases the ca ~ + sensitivity of contractile
proteins and protein kinase c. kitazawa et al. (1989)
reported a similar observation. takayanagi and onozuka 11990) demonstrated in fura-2-1oaded thoracic
aorta strips from rabbit that a grcater tension was
developed at the same low levels of [ca-'+]i in the
presence of clonidine and tizanidine, partial agonists,
than in the presence of norepinephrine and phenylephrine, full agonists, and that the maximum cytosolic
ca-" ~ level in the presence of clonidine and tizanidinc
was lower than that in the prcsence of norepinephrine
and phenylephrine. these authors also found that thc
slope of regrcssion lines between [ca2"]i and tension
development for clonidinc and tizanidine, partial (~adrcnoceptor agonists, were steeper than those for
norcpincphrine and phcnylephrinc, full oel-adrcnocep-

1.73-139

tor agonists, suggesting that the partial agonists cause
greater muscle tension than the full agonists at the
same level of [ca -~+]i- in another experiment, reported
by suzuki el al. (1990), two pharmacologically distinct
ce~-adrenoceptor subtypes in rabbit aorta were found to
utilize different signal transduction mcchanisms. thcsc
observations suggest that, in addition to changing
[ca:* ]i, crl-adrenoceptor subtypes modulate and regulate the sensitivity of the contractile apparatus of
smooth muscle to [ca=-] i. thc ca e~ sensitization induced by receptor agonists is accompanied by an increase in myosin light chain phosphoulation in intact
and pcrmeabilized smooth muscle preparations (reinbold and murphy, 1988; suematsu et al., 1991: hori ct
al., 1992). the primary mechanism underlying smooth
muscle contraction is phosphorylation of the 20-kda
myosin light chain by cae'-calmodulin-dependcnt
myosin light chain kinase. as shown in fig. 2, application of norepinephrine and clonidine increased myosin
light chain phosphorylation; the increase produced by
norcpinephrine was larger than that produced by chmidine, indicating that tile increase produced by each
agonist quantitatively explains tile contraction. one
interesting observation in this study was that the ca 2
sensitization through ¢~,x-subtype receptors was climihated by thc potcnt protein kinase c inhibitor. [t-7,
but that the amplitude of the contraction induced by
pca6.5 was not affected. these obserwttions arc supported by the earlier findings that actiwttors of protein
kinasc (7, phorbol esters, increase ca a+ sensitivity in
intact and permcabilizcd smooth muscle preparations
(nishimura aud vall breemcn, 1989; anabuki c t a [ . ,
1991); singer, 1990), and that various receptor agonists
actiwtte inositol phosphate metabolism to gcncratc the
endogeneous actiwm~r of protein kinasc (', diacylglycerol (berridgc, 1984; nishizuka, 1992). thus, h-7
does not act directly on the ca-"-depcndent contractile apparatus, but inhibits the activating effect by
which protein kinase (" regulates ca e +-calunlodulin-dcpendent myosin light chain kinasc.
from the above, it can bc concluded thal the ca e'
sensitization of contraction mediated by t~t-adrcnoccptors is produced by both t~l.x and ¢~tl, subtypes, and is
directly or indirectly regulated by intracclh|lar signal
transduction pathways involving g-protems, including
thc small g-protein and protein kinase (' (-'a 2~ systems.
