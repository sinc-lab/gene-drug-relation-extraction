abstract
eight derivatives of [11c] xxxd440xxx  were evaluated as alternative mu opiod receptor radioligands with the potential for lower
pharmacological activity, faster pharmacokinetics, and/or lower non-specific binding. derivatives with aryl ring substituents or alkyl group
substitutions were prepared in carbon-11 labeled form and examined for initial brain uptake and regional brain tissue pharmacokinetics in
mouse brain. promising derivatives with chloro, methoxy and methyl substituents on one aryl ring were then evaluated for specific binding
in an equilibrium infusion rat model of regional brain distributions. although no derivatives were identified with improved pharmacokinetics
or lower non-specific binding, several derivatives show acceptable in vivo specific binding properties and may deserve further evaluation
as less potent and thus safer compounds for in vivo imaging studies. © 2004 elsevier inc. all rights reserved.

1. introduction
 xxxd440xxx  (cfn) is a highly potent synthetic opioid
agonist with excellent selectivity for the mu subtype of the
opioid receptors (ki values: mu, 0.024 nm; delta, 3.28 nm;
kappa, 43.1 nm; [8]). in carbon-11 labeled form it has
become routinely used in human studies of opioid dependence, and for investigations of pain mechanisms
([1,6,9,10,11]). [11c] xxxd440xxx  ([11c]cfn) is a demanding radiotracer as the potent physiological effects require
production at very high specific activities. in animals pet
imaging studies, which generally require concomitant use of
a general anesthetic, the pharmacological activity of
[11c] xxxd440xxx  preparations can become limiting. an improved mu opioid agonist radiotracer which retains the
subtype specificity and low non-specific binding of
[11c]cfn, but exhibits less pharmacological activity and
perhaps faster pharmacokinetics, would be of considerable
value for future animal and perhaps clinical imaging studies
of the mu opiate system. we report here the synthesis and in
vivo evaluation of a short series of derivatives and analogs

of  xxxd440xxx  based on the previous report of janssen et al
[3].

2. materials and methods
2.1. general synthesis of precursors
the carboxylic acids serving as precursors for radiolabeling were synthesized by minor modifications of the general sequence used to prepare the desmethyl  xxxd440xxx  [3].
this involved alkylation of the piperidine nitrogen of 4-carboxy-4-n-phenylaminopiperidine with the appropriate alkyl
or (2-phenyl)ethyl bromide.
2.2. general radiolabeling procedure
the carbon-11 labeled derivatives shown in fig. 1 were
prepared using o-[11c]methylation of the corresponding
free carboxylic acids, using the method developed for
[11c] xxxd440xxx  [4]. this procedure uses an extraction disk
technology which efficiently and completely removes unreacted precursor from the final radiolabeled products. radiochemical purities of all products were ⬎95%. specific activities at the time of injection into animals were ⬎1500
ci/mmol.

2.3. biological studies
all animal studies were approved by the university of
michigan committee on the use and care of animals
(iacuc). studies were done in female cd-1 mice and
female cd rats (charles rivers, portage, mi, u.s.a).
2.3.1. mouse brain regional pharmacokinetics
groups of mice (3– 4 animals) were anesthetized with
 xxxd2052xxx  and injected via the tail vein with a solution of
radiotracer (60⫺150 microcuries) in isotonic saline. animals were allowed to recover, then anesthetized and killed
at 2, 15 or 30 minutes after injection. a blood sample was
obtained, then the brains were rapidly removed and dissected into samples of the cortex, striatum, cerebellum,
hippocampus, hypothalamic region, pons/medulla, and cortex. tissue samples were rapidly weighed and then counted
for carbon-11 using an automatic gamma counter. data was
calculated as percent injected dose per gram tissue for each
region, and as percent injected dose per gram for whole
brain.
2.3.2. rat equilibrium infusion studies
under sodium pentobarbital anesthesia, the animals (n
⫽ 4 per set) were prepared for intravenous radiotracer
injections by incision of the skin and insertion of a catheter
into one femoral vein. the incisions were then closed, and
the animal placed in a plastic restrainer tube and allowed to
awaken. all studies were done using animals in the fully

awake but restrained state. all radiotracer injections (2.6– 4.8
mci) were done through the femoral vein catheters using a
harvard programmable infusion pump. bolus plus infusions
studies were performed using a bolus administration of 66.6%
of the dose (1 ml) over a one minute period, followed by
constant infusion of the remaining 33.3% (0.5 ml) of the dose
over the following 59 minutes. at the end of the infusion the
animals were killed and the brains removed and dissected as
described above. distribution volume ratios were calculated as
the ratio between concentrations (% injected dose/g tissue) in
various brain regions divided by the concentration in the cerebellum. regional brain binding potentials were calculated as
bp ⫽ dvr – 1.
3. results
the initial screen of these new radioligands was done
using the regional brain distributions in mice. initial whole
brain uptake of radioactivity at 2 minutes following i.v.
injection is a reasonable index of the blood-brain-barrier
permeability of new radiotracers: of the new compounds
tested in this way, three ([11c]4-meocfn, [11c]2meocfn and [11c]h6-cfn) had considerably lower total
brain uptake (fig. 2). the remaining compounds had uptake
similar or exceeding that of [11c] xxxd440xxx , with the highest initial brain uptake shown by the 2-chloro derivative
([11c]2-clcfn).

[11c]2-meocfn exhibited slightly faster clearance from
the striatum.
the 2-chloro-, 2-methoxy- and 2-methyl-substituted derivatives, along with [11c]cfn, were then examined in the
rat bolus plus infusion model. the equilibrium binding
potentials (bp) for the three new radioligands as well as
[11c]cfn are shown in table 1. all four radioligands
showed the expected distribution of specific binding (hypothalamus ⬎ thalamus, striatum ⬎ cortex) within the rat
brain. again, as was seen with the mouse study, the 2-methoxy compound showed the greatest difference among the
group of compounds, having both lower bp values (table 1)
and lower absolute concentrations of radioactivity (data not
shown).

per fig. 1.

the regional brain distribution was determined at 2, 15
and 30 minutes as a screen of the pharmacokinetics and
specific binding of the new radioligands to the target site,
the  xxxg1635xxx . the ratios of regional tissue uptake
to that of the cerebellum was used as an estimate of the
specific binding, given the low specific binding of
[11c]cfn in the cerebellum: tissue/cerebellum data for the
striatum, cortex, hypothalamic region and thalamus are
shown in fig. 3 for [11c]cfn and each of the eight analogs
or derivatives. four of the derivatives, [11c]4-meocfn,
[11c]3-meocfn, [11c]h6-cfn and [11c]c5-cfn, showed
poor discrimination between regions of high and low receptor concentration, with tissue/cerebellum ratios either very
low or essentially equal to one. the four remaining compounds all showed tissue/cerebellum ratios at 15 minutes
that were equivalent to those obtained with [11c]cfn. in
examining the kinetic data (fig. 4), none of the new compounds showed any significant difference in the rate of
clearance from the cerebellum, but 2-[11c]clcfn and

although [11c] xxxd440xxx  has now proven to be a very
useful radioligand for human pet studies of mu opioid
receptors, an agonist radioligand with lower pharmacological activity would certainly enhance the safety aspect of
this radiopharmaceutical. a radioligand with faster pharmacokinetics would also allow faster equilibrium in an infusion paradigm, perhaps permitting new approaches to testretest protocols, and of course lower non-specific binding
always is a desirable improvement in an in vivo radioligand.
in this work we have examined a short series of  xxxd440xxx 
derivatives, looking for just these properties in a potential
replacement radioligand.
 xxxd440xxx  is one of a series of fentanyl derivatives that
was examined by janssen et al [3] for pharmacological
activity in a rodent analgesia model [2]. in that in vivo
model it is extremely potent, with an ed50 of 0.6 microgram/kg i.v. other compounds examined in that initial series, including several of those chosen here for labeling with
carbon-11, have lower biological activities: the ed50 for the
2-mecfn is 2 micrograms/kg i.v., and 1 microgram/kg i.v.
for the 2-meocfn. given the extremely potent effects of
 xxxd440xxx , even a 2- to 3-fold lower pharmacological activity would significantly impact on the safety of carbon-11
labeled radiopharmaceuticals of this class.
initial studies of regional brain pharmacokinetics in the
mouse brain identified that four of the compounds (those
having the methoxy groups in the 3- or 4-position of the
phenyl ring, or substitution of the phenyl ring with alkyl or
cycloalkyl groups) showed poor in vivo specific binding.
these were thus not considered as candidates for further
evaluation. three of the remaining compounds, having
methyl, methoxy or chloro substituents in the 2-position of
the phenyl ring, were further evaluated in the rat
bolus⫹infusion, equilibrium distribution model. we have
previously determined that radiotracers with reversible
pharmacokinetics can be readily infused to reach equilibrium brain concentrations [5], and thus the specific binding
(binding potential) can be simply estimated as the equilib-

rium ratio between regions of high specific binding and a
region devoid (or with very low concentrations) of receptors. we have successfully applied this technique to such
diverse radiotracers as (⫹)-␣-[11c]dihydrotetrabenazine,
d-threo-[11c]methylphenidate, [11c]flumazenil, [11c]raclopride, and and n-[11c]methylpiperidinyl benzilate [5,7] for
ex vivo studies in animals and pet imaging in both animals
and humans. from the kinetic studies in the mouse brain
(fig. 4) it was evident that cfn and the new derivatives all
showed rapid brain pharmacokinetics similar to previous
compounds where we had successfully applied this infusion
to equilibrium technique.
in the comparison of the [11c]2-methoxycfn, [11c]2methylcfn and [11c]2-chlorocfn derivatives with
[11c]cfn using the equilibrium infusion approach, the
2-methoxy derivative was clearly the least promising, as it
showed lower brain uptake (lower % injected dose/g, data

not shown) and striatal and hypothalamic binding potentials
significantly lower than the other three compounds. the
chloro and methyl substituted compounds showed marginally higher brain concentrations, consistent with their higher
lipophilicities, but [11c]cfn showed the highest specific
binding (binding potentials) in all regions of the rat brain.
the goal of this work was the identification of a carbon-11 labeled  xxxd440xxx  derivative(s) which might lead to
improved measures of specific binding to mu opioid receptors, be safer to administer even when working at the tracer
level, or show faster pharmacokinetics. of the compounds
tested so far, none has shown significantly improved nonspecific binding, or radically different brain pharmacokinetics. the 2-mecfn was shown by janssen et al [2] to show
lower activity in a biological assay of analgesia, and thus
compounds [11c]2-mecfn or [11c]2-chlorocfn may be of
potential interest due to the possibility of greater safety

margin. there are of course a number of unresolved issues
regarding these  xxxd440xxx  derivatives. we have not evaluated the in vitro affinities or subtype selectivity of any of the
derivatives, although the good selectivity of the parent compound  xxxd440xxx  and the good correlation between the
binding potentials among the four compounds examined
(cfn, 2-mecfn, 2-meocfn and 2-cl-cfn) is encouraging that selectivity for the mu subtype was retained. the
specificity of the new compounds for the  xxxg1635xxx 
was also not tested, although there is excellent specificity of
 xxxd440xxx  for the opioid receptor and essentially no affinity
for other receptors, transporters and enzymes. that we
reached true equilibrium binding in the rat brain was not
verified, but the procedures used and the pharmacokinetics
of the compounds tested are very similar to those of radiotracers previously validated in this model, and the comparisons between the radiotracers studied here should be indicative of significant differences among them. finally, we did
not evaluate any metabolic differences between the derivatives and  xxxd440xxx , but again the addition of an aryl chloro
or methyl group does not introduce groups particularly
sensitive to metabolism (introduction of the 2-methoxy substituent does introduce a potential site of metabolism not
found in  xxxd440xxx ). these questions of specificity, metabolism and toxicology should be investigated in the event any
further evaluation of these  xxxd440xxx  derivatives is pursued, although at present none of the new compounds shows
enough improvement over the clinically used radiotracer,
[11c] xxxd440xxx , to merit extensive studies of pharmacology
or metabolism.
