the nonreceptor protein  xxxg2198xxx  src is overexpressed in 70% of pancreatic adenocarcinomas. here,
we describe the effect of molecular and pharmacological down-regulation of src on incidence, growth, and
metastasis of pancreatic tumor cells in an orthotopic
model. src expression in l3.6pl human pancreatic tumor cells was reduced by stable expression of a plasmid
encoding small interfering rna (sirna) to  xxxg2198xxx . in stable sirna clones, src expression was reduced >80%,
with no change in expression of the related kinases
 xxxg2437xxx  and c-lyn, and proliferation rates were similar in
all clones. phosphorylation of akt and  xxxd1355xxx /42 erk mitogen-activated protein kinase and production of vegf
and il-8 in culture supernatants were also reduced (p <
0.005). on orthotopic implantation of varying cell numbers into nude mice, tumor incidence was unchanged;
however, in the sirna clones, large tumors failed to
develop, and incidence of metastasis was significantly
reduced, suggesting that  xxxg2198xxx  activity is critical to tumor
progression. to examine this possibility further, animals bearing established wild-type tumors were treated
with the src/abl-selective inhibitor  xxxd1815xxx  ( xxxd1815xxx ). tumor size was decreased, and incidence of
metastases was significantly reduced in treated mice
compared with controls. these results demonstrate that
src activation contributes to pancreatic tumor progression in this model, offering src as a candidate for

targeted therapy. (am j pathol 2006, 168:962–972; doi:

adenocarcinoma of the exocrine pancreas is the fourth
most common cause of cancer death in developed countries with more than 30,000 estimated deaths in 2004 in
the united states alone.1 of the 5% of patients who
present with resectable disease, only 12% survive 1 year
after diagnosis and less than 5% survive 5 years.2– 4
metastasis to the lymphatics, liver, and vessel walls leads
to widespread disease, resulting in a severe wasting
condition that accounts for approximately 80% of deaths
in advanced pancreatic cancer.5 even when potentially
curative surgery is performed, approximately 80 to 90%
of patients develop disease recurrence with standard
chemotherapeutic agents having marginal effect on patient survival. because of the high mortality associated
with pancreatic adenocarcinoma and early systemic disease, it is essential that therapeutic regimens be developed to inhibit tumor progression and metastasis.
the progression of pancreatic adenocarcinoma has
been associated with deregulation of several signaling
molecules.6 one of the potential therapeutic targets receiving considerable recent attention is activation of csrc, a nonreceptor protein  xxxg2198xxx .  xxxg2198xxx  is a
60-kd prototype of a nine-member family of structurally
related src family kinases (sfks). in normal cells, sfks
regulate diverse biological processes by associating with
multiple signaling and structural molecules. overexpressupported in part by grants from the national institutes of health (2ro1

src and pancreatic adenocarcinoma metastasis
963
ajp march 2006, vol. 168, no. 3

sion of sfks occurs in many solid tumors, often at later
stages of disease,7 and can be predictive of poor prognosis.8 in addition, src activation can be associated with
chemoresistance. thus, gleevec-resistant chronic myeloid leukemia (cml)9 and taxol-resistant ovarian cancer
cells10 are frequently associated with increased expression of sfks.
in pancreatic adenocarcinomas, src is activated in
more than 70% of primary tumors.11 several recent reports have implicated this activity as important to properties of tumor progression. ito et al12 demonstrated that
inhibition of src resulted in a 90% decrease in in vitro
pancreatic cancer cell invasiveness by inhibiting srcdependent matrix metalloproteinases mmp 2 and mmp 9.
we have recently demonstrated that src is a critical regulator of pro-angiogenic molecules.13–15 duxbury et al16
have provided evidence that gemcitabine resistance correlates with increased src activity, and src inhibition
overcomes this resistance. recently, src inhibition with a
novel src family kinase inhibitor has demonstrated significant antitumor and antimetastatic activity in a pancreatic
cancer orthotopic nude mouse model.17 these data support a potential role for src inhibitors in the treatment of
pancreatic cancer.
however, signal transduction inhibitors affect multiple
targets, and “off-target” inhibition can be responsible for
antitumor effects. additionally, sfks have overlapping
functions in multiple signaling pathways. therefore, we
first used molecular strategies to examine the specific
role of  xxxg2198xxx  in pancreatic tumor growth in vitro and in vivo.
we then determined whether  xxxd1815xxx , a dual src/abl
inhibitor,18 would give results similar to those of the molecular approach. the data in this study strongly support
a role for activation of  xxxg2198xxx , as opposed to other sfk
members, in pancreatic tumor progression in a relevant
mouse model and suggest that src-selective inhibitors
could have efficacy in preventing or delaying pancreatic
tumor metastasis.

materials and methods
cell lines
the l3.6pl pancreatic cancer cell line was obtained from
dr. lee ellis (university of texas-md anderson cancer
center). the l3.6pl cell line was derived from a repeated
cycle of injecting colo-357 cells into the pancreas of
nude mice, selecting for liver metastases, and re-injecting into the pancreas.19 the cells were plated on 10-cm
tissue culture dishes, grown as monolayer cultures, and
maintained in culture in minimal essential media supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (fbs) (hyclone,
logan, ut), 2 mmol/l l-glutamine, and 0.6% penicillin/
streptomycin and 5% co2/95% air at 37°c.

cell lysis and protein extraction
cells (1 ⫻ 106) were plated in 10-cm dishes and maintained in minimal essential media with 10% fbs. at 70 to
80% confluence, the cells were washed with dulbecco’s

phosphate buffered saline (d-pbs) at 37°c and maintained in serum-free media (10 ml) for 24 hours. the cells
and supernatants were harvested at 24 hours. the cells
were washed with ice-cold 1⫻ d-pbs, scraped from the
plates, lysed, and harvested on ice in radio-immune precipitation assay (ripa-b) buffer (20 mmol/l sodium phosphate buffer, 150 mmol/l nacl, 5 mmol/l edta, 1%
triton x-100, and 0.5% sodium  xxxd1835xxx ) supplemented with one tablet complete mini-edta protease
inhibitor cocktail (roche diagnostic, mannheim, germany) and sodium orthovanadate (1 mmol/l, ph 7.4).
harvested orthotopic pancreatic tumors were homogenized in ripa-b buffer using a tissue homogenizer. the
homogenates were clarified by centrifugation at 15,000 ⫻
g for 15 minutes at 4°c and prepared for western analysis and immunoprecipitation. metastases were isolated
from normal liver, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and lysed in
ripa-b via mortar and pestle.

creation of small interfering rna (sirna)
expression plasmids for silencing src gene
expression
sirna expression plasmids were created as described
elsewhere,13 using the ambion psilencer 1.0-u6 (austin,
tx) according to manufacturer’s directions. briefly, c-srcspecific target sequences were designed using the ambion sirna web design tool. the two target sequences
used were (52 to 71 bp) 5⬘-aacaagag caagcccaaggat-3⬘ and (226 to 244 bp) 5⬘-aagctgttcggaggcttcaac-3⬘. oligonucleotides corresponding to these sequences with flanking apai (5⬘) and ecor1 (3⬘) ends were
purchased from invitrogen/life technologies (carlsbad,
ca) and ligated into the expression plasmid at compatible sites. constructs were confirmed by dna sequencing. l3.6pl cells were then transfected with 0.5 ng of each
sirna plasmid and 10 ng of pcdna  xxxg418xxx  resistance
promoterless plasmid for selection of transfectants. cells
were then grown in selective media containing  xxxg418xxx  as
previously described.20 negative controls were transfected with empty vector target sequences and pcdna
plasmids at identical concentrations. total  xxxg2198xxx  expression levels in sirna clones were determined by western
blot analysis.

cell proliferation assay
cell proliferation was quantified by 3-(4,5-dimethyl-2-thiazol-2-yl) 2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay (trivegen, gaithersburg, md). cells were seeded into 96-well
plates at 1 ⫻ 103 cells per well and allowed to adhere
overnight in medium containing 10% fbs. the cells were
maintained in standard culture conditions, and cellular
proliferation and viability were assayed at different time
points. plates were read using spectrophotometric analysis at a wavelength of 570 nm using the tecan genios
plate reader (tecan us, durham, nc) and magellan
version 4.0 software. twelve samples were used for each

964
trevino et al

cell clone, and the experiments were performed in
triplicate.

immunoblot analysis
total protein concentrations were determined via the biorad dc protein assay protocol (bio-rad, hercules, ca)
followed by spectrophotometric analysis using the
tecan genios plate reader and magellan version 4.0
software. equal amounts of protein (50 ␮g) were loaded
in each well, separated via 8% sodium dodecyl sulfatepolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (sds-page), and
electroblotted onto immobilon-p membranes (millipore,
billerica, ma). the membranes were blocked with trisbuffered saline/tween (0.1%) ⫹ 5% dried milk for 30
minutes and probed with desired primary antibody diluted 1:1000 in blocking buffer overnight at 4°c. membranes were probed with polyclonal antibodies to phospho-akts473 (cell signaling technology, beverly, ma),
phospho- xxxd1355xxx /42 erkt202/y204 (cell signaling technology), and total  xxxd1355xxx /42 erk mitogen-activated protein kinase (mapk) (ab-2; calbiochem, san diego, ca) and
monoclonal antibodies to total src (calbiochem),  xxxg2437xxx 
(wako chemicals, richmond, va), lyn (santa cruz biotechnology, santa cruz, ca), akt (5g3; cell signaling
technology), and vinculin (sigma-aldrich, st. louis, mo).
primary antibody incubation was followed by incubation
with a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (bio-rad goat anti-mouse and sheep anti-rabbit)
diluted 1:2000 in blocking buffer for 1 hour at room temperature with gentle rocking. western blot analyses of
actin and vinculin expression were performed as a loading control using anti-actin and anti-vinculin monoclonal
antibodies (sigma-aldrich). proteins were visualized
by incubation with ecl detection reagents (perkinelmer, boston, ma) and exposed to film (kodak biomax
mr, rochester, ny). membranes were stripped and
reprobed.

immunoprecipitation
for detection of  xxxg2437xxx  expression in tumor samples, 500
␮g of the samples in 650 ␮l of ripa buffer was incubated
by rotation with 6 ␮l of antibody to total  xxxg2437xxx  overnight at
4°c. fifty ␮l of a 1:1 slurry of protein g agarose in ripa-b
buffer was added and incubated with rotation for 1 additional hour at 4°c. bound proteins were pelleted by centrifugation, washed three times with ripa-b buffer, and
eluted by boiling in 1⫻ laemmli’s sample buffer with
subsequent immunoblotting with antibodies against cyes (1:1000).

were frozen at ⫺80°c. quantitative measurements of il-8
and vegf in the cell supernatants were determined using
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (elisa) kits (quantikine human il-8 immunoassay; r&d systems, minneapolis, mn; and human vegf immunoassay kit; biosource international, inc., camarillo, ca) following the
manufacturers’ instructions. the detection limits of the
il-8 and vegf elisas were 37 and 23.4 pg/ml, respectively. il-8 and vegf concentrations (picograms/milliliter)
were determined spectrophotometrically at 450 nm using
a tecan genios plate reader and magellan version 4.0
software and normalized against total protein levels in the
corresponding cell lysate. the results are presented as
the means of triplicate determinations (⫾sd).

animals
specific, pathogen-free male nude mice (strain ncr-nu)
were purchased from the animal production area of the
national cancer institute-frederick cancer research
and development center (frederick, md). the mice were
housed and maintained in specific, pathogen-free conditions. the facilities have been approved by the american
association for accreditation of laboratory animal care
and meet all current regulations and standards of the
u.s. department of agriculture, the u.s. department of
health and human services, and the national institutes of
health. the mice were used between the ages of 8 and
12 weeks, in accordance with institutional guidelines.

orthotopic pancreatic injections
for in vivo injection, cells were harvested from 10-cm
tissue culture dish by a 2- to 3-minute treatment with 1⫻
trypsin followed by suspension in a d-pbs solution. only
single-cell suspensions of greater than 90% viability, as
determined by trypan blue exclusion, were used for injection. male nude mice were anesthetized with  xxxd2604xxx . a small left abdominal flank incision was made,
and the spleen and pancreas were exteriorized. tumor
cells (5 ⫻ 105), including sirna clones, vector, and
wild-type parental controls, in d-pbs were injected subcapsularly into a region of the pancreas just beneath the
spleen with a 27-gauge needle and 1-ml disposable syringe. to prevent intraperitoneal leakage, a cotton swab
was held for 1 minute over the site of injection. both layers
of the abdominal wound were closed with wound clips
(autoclip; clay adams, parsippany, nj). a successful
subcapsular intrapancreatic injection of tumor cells was
identified by the appearance of a fluid bleb without intraperitoneal leakage. mice were sacrificed via cervical dislocation 6 weeks after orthotopic injections.

tumor cells, the mice were randomized into two groups:
treatment and control (n ⫽ 8). the treatment group received 15 mg 䡠 kg⫺1 䡠 day⫺1  xxxd1815xxx , solubilized in a
sodium citrate/ xxxd1710xxx  buffer diluent, by oral gavage.
the control group received citrate buffer diluent alone. all
mice were sacrificed by cervical dislocation on day 42.
tumor volume (measured by caliper), weight, and incidence of regional (celiac or para-aortal) lymph node and
liver metastases were recorded. tissue not homogenized
immediately for western blot analysis was snap-frozen in
liquid nitrogen and immediately frozen at ⫺80°c. for
immunohistochemical staining, a part of the tumor was
embedded in oct compound (sakura fineter, torrance,
ca), snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at ⫺80°c.

immunohistochemical determination of
 xxxg1724xxx / xxxg1724xxx , src, phospho-akt, and
phospho-erk 44/42
frozen tissues used for identification of  xxxg1724xxx / xxxg1724xxx 
and src (green fluorescence) were sectioned (8 to 10
␮m), mounted on positively charged plus slides (fisher
scientific, loughborough, uk), and air-dried for 30 minutes. the sections were fixed in cold acetone for 5
minutes, followed by 1:1 acetone:chloroform (v/v) for
5 minutes, and then acetone for 5 minutes. the sections
were washed with pbs, and immunohistochemical staining for  xxxg1724xxx  was performed as previously described.21 a
positive reaction was visualized by incubating the slides
in stable 3,3⬘-diaminobenzidine (dab) for 10 to 20 minutes. the sections were rinsed with distilled water, counterstained with gill’s hematoxylin for 1 minute, and
mounted with universal mount (research genetics,
huntsville, al). control samples were exposed to secondary antibody alone and demonstrated no specific
staining. sections analyzed for src were pretreated with
goat anti-mouse igg f(ab)2 fragment (1:10 dilution in
pbs) for 4 to 6 hours before incubation with the primary
antibody. the samples were then incubated at 4°c for 18
hours with a 1:200 dilution of monoclonal mouse antihuman antibody for src (calbiochem). the samples were
then rinsed three times for 3 minutes each with pbs and
incubated at room temperature for 1 hour with a 1:200
dilution of secondary alexa fluor 488-conjugated antimouse antibody, avoiding exposure to light. all samples
were washed twice with pbs containing 0.1% brij and
washed with pbs for 5 minutes, and nuclear staining was
performed by incubating the samples with 300 mg/ml
hoechst dye diluted in pbs for 2 minutes. the nuclei were
identified by blue staining, and src was identified by
green fluorescence. control samples were exposed to
secondary antibody alone and demonstrated no specific
staining.
paraffin-embedded tissues were used for identification
of src (dab), phospho-akt, and phospho-erk 44/42. sections (4 to 6 ␮m thick) were mounted on positively
charged superfrost slides (fischer scientific, co., houston, tx) and dried overnight. sections were deparaffinized in xylene, then treated with a graded series of
alcohol [100, 95, and 80% ethanol (v/v) in double distilled

h2o], and rehydrated in pbs (ph 7.5). sections were
treated with 10 mmol/l citrate buffer, ph 6.0, and microwaved 10 minutes for antigen retrieval. sections were
blocked with 3% h2o2 in pbs for 12 minutes and washed
with pbs (3 ⫻ 5 minutes). the sections were blocked with
4% fish gel for 20 minutes and then incubated with the
appropriate primary antibody, anti-src (cell signaling
technology), anti-phospho-akt (cell signaling technology), or anti-phospho-erk 44/42 (cell signaling technology) overnight at 4°c. immunohistochemistry for src was
performed using avidin-biotin blocking (biocare medical,
concord, ma), followed by goat anti-rabbit biotinylation
(biocare medical) and streptavadin-horseradish peroxidase incubation for 30 minutes each at room temperature. immunohistochemistry for phospho-akt and phospho-erk 44/42 was performed using goat anti-rabbit
biotinylation and streptavadin-horseradish peroxidase
(dako, glostrup, denmark) incubation for 30 minutes
each at room temperature. a positive reaction was visualized by incubating the slides in stable dab for 10 to 20
minutes. the sections were rinsed with distilled water,
counterstained with gill’s hematoxylin for 1 minute, and
mounted with universal mount (research genetics,
huntsville, al). control samples were exposed to secondary antibody alone and demonstrated no specific
staining.

immunofluorescence microscopy
immunofluorescence microscopy was performed using
an epifluorescence microscope equipped with narrow
band pass excitation filters mounted in a filter wheel (ludl
electronic products, hawthorne, ny) to select for green
fluorescence. images were captured using a 3ccd camera (photometrics, tuscon, az) mounted on a zeiss universal microscope (carl zeiss, thornwood, ny) and optimas image analysis software (bioscan, edmond, wa)
installed on a compaq computer with pentium chip,
frame grabber, an optical disk storage system, and a
mavigraph up-d7000 digital color printer (sony, tokyo,
japan). images were additionally processed using
adobe photoshop software (adobe systems, mountain
view, ca). for the quantification of  xxxg1724xxx  staining, 10
random 0.159-mm2 fields at ⫻100 magnification were
captured for each tumor, and microvessels were quantified according to the method described previously.22,23

statistical analyses
the significance of differences in il-8 and vegf cytokine
expression between cells was determined using a student’s t-test (two tailed). the significance of differences in
primary tumor growth and metastases was determined
using student’s t-test (two tailed), and vessel density in
sirna tumor samples versus control samples was determined using a mann-whitney u-test. a value of p ⬍ 0.05
was deemed significant.

figure 2. reduced  xxxg2198xxx  expression results in decreased activation of akt
and erk 44/42. parental l3.6pl cells or clonal variants expressing empty
vector or  xxxg2198xxx -targeted sirna (sisrc c1 and c2) were plated and maintained
as described in figure 1. twenty-four hours after plating, cells were serumstarved for 24 hours, and cell lysates were harvested as described in materials
and methods. expression of phosphorylated akt and erk 44/42 was determined by western blot analysis. blots were stripped and re-probed for total
akt and erk 44/42, respectively. anti-vinculin western blot analysis was
performed as a loading control. blots are representative of three independent
experiments.

affecting in vitro growth rates. a: stable  xxxg418xxx -resistant l3.6pl clones expressing either  xxxg2198xxx -targeted sirna (sisrc c1, c2, and c3) or vector controls were
generated from parental l3.6pl cells as described in materials and methods.
fifty micrograms of ripa cell lysates were resolved by 8% sds-page and

were plated on day 0 as described in materials and methods. 3-(4,5-dimethyl2-thiazol-2-yl) 2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assays were performed 1, 24,
48, 72, and 96 hours after plating. values represent the mean of three
experiments.

described in materials and methods. several colonies
from single cells were expanded, and sfk expression
was determined. as shown in figure 1a, src levels were
significantly reduced (4- to 5-fold) in each sirna clone
(sisrc c1, sisrc c2, and sisrc c3) when compared with
parental and vector control cells. in contrast, there was
no change in expression of the most related sfk member
 xxxg2437xxx  or of c-lyn. to examine whether cell proliferation in
vitro was affected by decreased  xxxg2198xxx  expression, proliferation rates were determined as described in materials
and methods. as shown in figure 1b, no significant differences were observed in proliferation rates of cells in
log phase growth. therefore, other sfks likely play redundant roles to src in regulating in vitro cell proliferation.

effects of src sirna on signaling intermediates
results
expression of sirna specifically reduces src
levels
to directly determine the role of src in regulating pancreatic tumor growth and metastasis, we used l3.6pl pancreatic cancer cells, a variant of colo-357 selected for
its high metastatic potential in orthotopic nude mouse
models. we also examined subclones of these cells that
expressed reduced  xxxg2198xxx  levels due to stable transfection of a psilencer vector expressing a src sirna, as

several previous studies have demonstrated that src
activity can directly or indirectly regulate members of the
mapk family as well as phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase ( xxxg1743xxx 
kinase) activity. therefore, the phosphorylation of  xxxd1355xxx /42
erk and akt (as a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase substrate)
was determined from cell lines expressing  xxxg2198xxx -targeted
sirna. as seen in figure 2, decreases in constitutive akt
and  xxxd1355xxx /42 erk phosphorylation were observed in the src
sirna clones relative to parental l3.6pl cells and vector
controls, with no change in expression of these signaling
enzymes.

figure 3. sirna-mediated  xxxg2198xxx  knockdown results in decreased expression
of il-8 and vegf. sisrc c1, c2, and c3; parental l3.6pl cells; and vector
controls were plated and maintained as described in materials and methods.
twenty-four hours after plating, the cell culture medium was replaced with
serum-free medium and allowed to incubate for an additional 24 hours, at
which point cell lysates and culture supernatants were harvested. il-8 and
vegf levels were measured by elisa as described in materials and methods
and expressed relative to total cellular protein (picograms/milligram). expression levels of both il-8 (black bars) and vegf (gray bars) were
reduced significantly (p ⬍ 0.005, n ⫽ 3) relative to controls.

 xxxg2198xxx  regulates il-8 and vegf expression in
l3.6pl cells
recent evidence has suggested that  xxxg2198xxx  may contribute to tumor growth/progression through regulation of
pro-angiogenic molecules.24 to examine the specific role
of  xxxg2198xxx  in regulating il-8 and vegf expression (the most
abundant pro-angiogenic molecules secreted by pancreatic tumor cells), expression of these cytokines was compared in sirna clones and parental cells. il-8 and vegf
levels were significantly reduced by approximately 14and 3-fold, respectively, in comparison with parental cells
and cells expressing vector alone (p ⬍ 0.005; figure 3),
corresponding with reduced src expression. these results are consistent with those obtained by pharmacological inhibition of sfks (data not shown), indicating that
 xxxg2198xxx  is required for maximal constitutive production of
il-8 and vegf in l3.6pl pancreatic cancer cells.

effects of decreased  xxxg2198xxx  expression on
tumor incidence, growth, and metastatic
potential
to examine effects on primary tumor incidence and
tumor growth between parental, vector, and sirna
clones, serial dilutions of 1.25, 2.5, and 5.0 ⫻ 105 cells
were injected into the pancreas as described in materials and methods. after 42 days, mice were sacrificed,
and tumor incidence and size were determined. tu-

figure 4. sirna-mediated reduction in  xxxg2198xxx  expression is maintained in
tumor cells grown in vivo. sisrc clones, parental l3.6pl cells, and vector
controls were injected into the pancreases of nude mice (5 ⫻ 105 cells/
mouse) on day 0. after 6 weeks, tumors were harvested and frozen in liquid
nitrogen. tumors were homogenized in ripa, tumor cell lysates were quantitated, and 50 ␮g of total protein was resolved by 8% sds-page. blots were
probed for total  xxxg2198xxx  and lyn as described in materials and methods.
because of low expression of  xxxg2437xxx , 500 ␮g of tumor lysates was immunoprecipitated with the anti-yes antibody, followed by anti-yes western blot
analysis. anti-␤-actin western blot analysis was performed as a total protein
loading control. results are representative of at least three independent
western blots. a specific reduction in total  xxxg2198xxx  levels was observed in the
sirna clones after 6 weeks growth in vivo in the absence of  xxxg418xxx .

mors were removed and processed for western blotting, immunofluorescence, and immunohistochemistry
as described in materials and methods. to determine
whether the tumors induced by sirna clones maintained reduced src expression, we performed immunoblotting on lysates from primary tumors (figure 4)
and immunofluorescence and immunohistochemistry
for total src expression (figure 5). as observed by
western blotting, src expression remained low in tumors, whereas protein levels of fellow src family kinases lyn and  xxxg2437xxx  were unchanged. these results
demonstrate that expression of sirna in primary tumor
cells was stable and  xxxg2198xxx  expression was specifically
reduced over the period analyzed. immunofluorescence and immunohistochemical staining of tumor
samples indicated that the reduced levels of  xxxg2198xxx 
expression occurred specifically in tumor cells
(figure 5).
as shown in table 1, at every cell number used as
inoculum, no significant differences were observed in
tumor incidence. these results suggest that reduction of
src expression was insufficient to inhibit tumor formation
of l3.6pl cells. at lower inocula (1.25 ⫻ 105 cells), tumor
sizes of parental and sirna clones were relatively similar.
however, whereas tumor size in parental cells increased
proportionally to the increased number of cells implanted, this was not observed in tumors from the sirna

tumors and liver metastases. l3.6pl parental and
sisrc primary tumor and liver samples (with and
without metastases) were harvested and prepared
for staining or western blot analysis as described in
materials and methods. a: hematoxylin and eosin
staining was performed to verify the presence of
tumors and metastases, compared with uninvolved
tissue. src expression was examined by immunofluorescence. all staining was performed as described
in materials and methods. for liver metastases, a
comparison of src staining in metastasis (m) is
shown relative to uninvolved liver (n). the images
shown are representative of sections obtained from
at least five tumor samples. results are shown for
sisrc c1. b: anti-src western blot analysis was performed on lysates of l3.6pl parental primary tumors,
liver metastases, and normal liver as described in
materials and methods.

incidence of metastasis was not due to tumor size,
because the sirna src clones were still significantly
reduced in incidence of metastasis at inocula of 1.25 ⫻
105, where primary tumor sizes were similar between
sirna clones and control (table 1). these results demonstrate that src expression and/or activity regulate the
ability of l3.6pl cells to metastasize. immunofluorescence staining for src expression in primary tumors
and metastases is presented in figure 6a. in liver
metastases arising from parental cells, src expression
was substantially increased relative to that observed in
primary tumors, consistent with changes in src expression and activity observed in human colon tumors.25
this result was corroborated by anti-src western blot
analysis of primary tumor samples, liver metastases,
and uninvolved liver, demonstrating that total  xxxg2198xxx 
expression in l3.6pl liver metastases was substantially
higher than in primary tumor or the surrounding uninvolved liver (figure 6b). there was insufficient tissue
from sisrc liver metastases to perform western blot

analysis. however, when metastases from sisrc clones
were examined for src expression via immunofluorescence, an increase was observed relative to that of
primary tumors, although the expression was not as
high as observed in metastases from parental cells
(figure 6a). these results suggest that some of the
metastatic potential of the sisrc c1 clone may be due
to escape of src down-regulation by the sirna expression vector.

treatment of tumor-bearing mice with
 xxxd1815xxx  inhibits tumor growth and metastasis
recently, the dual src/abl inhibitor  xxxd1815xxx  has been
demonstrated to show efficacy against cml cells in vitro
and in vivo.18 we therefore sought to determine whether
this clinically relevant inhibitor would have efficacy in
pancreatic tumor cells, and if so, whether it would have
similar effects on development of metastases as observed in sirna clones. in contrast to the sirna clones,
 xxxd1815xxx  inhibited activity of all src family members in
vitro (data not shown), consistent with previous findings
on this pharmacological agent.26 to examine effects in
vivo, 14 days after inoculating mice with 1 ⫻ 106 l3.6pl
cells, mice were treated daily by oral gavage with  xxxd1815xxx . as shown in table 2, all mice developed primary
tumors, but tumor size in the pancreas was significantly
reduced (p ⬍ 0.05) as was incidence of metastasis, with
only 14% of treated mice developing metastases compared with 60% of vehicle control mice. these results
correspond with those obtained with the sirna src
clones, suggesting that  xxxg2198xxx  and/or src family kinases
are the likely therapeutic targets for  xxxd1815xxx  in this
model.

antibodies to reveal activation of akt,  xxxd1355xxx /42 erk, and  xxxg1724xxx ⫹ vessel infiltration, respectively. immunohistochemical staining was performed as described in materials and methods. the images shown are representative of
sections obtained from at least five tumor samples. results are shown for
sisrc c1.

discussion
despite aggressive treatment for pancreatic adenocarcinoma, the prognosis remains poor. the high mortality is
in part due to micrometastatic disease that is not detected at the time of surgery. thus, therapeutic strategies
that control the spread of pancreatic carcinomas are
especially critical to potential control of this disease. in
this study, we have shown that src activation affects
pancreatic tumor progression through activation of several signaling molecules that are known to contribute to
tumor cell survival and increased metastatic potential. to
examine the specific role of src in pancreatic tumor
growth and progression, we first used an sirna approach whereby src was specifically and stably reduced
in the highly metastatic l3.6pl cells. whereas tumors
develop in sirna clones, even in equivalent sized tumors, the incidence of metastasis was much higher in
wild-type and vector controls than in sirna clones or in
mice treated with  xxxd1815xxx . these results suggest that

cules in vitro, vessels in tumors from sisrc clones, as
determined by  xxxg1724xxx / xxxg1724xxx  staining, were significantly reduced (figure 7). parental l3.6pl tumors produced a mean vessel count of 14 ⫾ 6 vessels/field compared with 16 ⫾ 4 vessels/field for l3.6pl vector tumors
and 5 ⫾ 3 vessels/field for l3.6pl sisrc c1 tumors (n ⫽
10; p ⬍ 0.0001). immunofluorescence and immunohistochemistry were also performed for phospho-akt and
phospho-erk 44/42 mapk (figure 7). again, consistent
with the in vitro results, phospho-erk 44/42 and phosphoakt levels were reduced in tumors produced from sisrc
clones. immunohistochemical staining verified that levels
of phospho-erk 44/42 and phospho-akt were reduced
specifically in sirna-expressing tumor cells.

src and pancreatic adenocarcinoma metastasis

expression and/or activation of src contributes directly to
metastatic potential.
although it is likely that multiple pathways regulated by
src contribute to its role in invasion and metastasis, we
have focused on the effect of src on pro-angiogenic
molecules. recently, we have demonstrated that src regulates expression of il-8 and vegf,13,14 both of which
contribute to angiogenesis and tumor progression
through paracrine effects on endothelial cells. consistent
with these results, bruns et al27 demonstrated decreased
growth and metastasis of l3.6pl cells in an orthotopic
model by the egf-r inhibitor pki166, correlating with
decreased il-8 and vegf expression.
recently, weis et al28 demonstrated another potential
role for src in regulation of angiogenesis critical to metastasis. their results suggest that src facilitates extravasation of tumor cells from its environment through disruption of the endothelial cell barrier function that
potentiates tumor cell metastasis. in src-null mice, a significant reduction in vegf-induced vascular permeability
led to significant decreases in metastases in experimental and spontaneous lung tumor metastasis models.29
thus, src affects several properties consistent with the
phenotype observed in this study, ie, development of
small tumors impaired in growth and metastasis.
other src functions are also associated with development of metastasis. src is a critical regulator of migration,
and src⫺/⫺ cells are deficient in this process.29 ito et al12
demonstrated that src family kinases regulate expression
of matrix metalloproteinases in pancreatic cancer cell
lines and that decreasing sfk decreases invasiveness of
these cells in vitro. src activity also correlates with the loss
of epithelial differentiation and cell adhesion system leading to increased metastatic potential of tumor cells.30,31
all of these properties are more consistent with src regulating tumor progression rather than tumor development
and are consistent with our results in the pancreatic
cancer model used in this study.
in contrast, pharmacological inhibitors against src
family kinases have shown a combined effect on primary
tumor growth as well as metastasis.17 whether these are
due to the pharmacological inhibition of other src family
members, because sfk function is required for proliferation, or reflect impairment of tumors to grow beyond a
given size remains to be determined. our results with
 xxxd1815xxx  show that it acts very similarly to sirna clones
in which src alone is reduced with respect to inhibition of
metastases. it should be noted, however, that treatment
with  xxxd1815xxx  resulted in a significant decrease in primary tumor size relative to controls, whereas sirna
clones were not significantly smaller than controls. this
result is likely due to inhibition of all sfks expressed in
the tumor cells by  xxxd1815xxx , although “off-target” inhibition that affects proliferation cannot be excluded. nevertheless, the data demonstrate that src-selective inhibitors
may show efficacy in inhibiting tumor progression.
in summary, the data presented in this study suggest
that src plays an important role in pancreatic tumor metastases. recently, src has emerged as an attractive
candidate molecule for targeted therapies, with development of several small molecule inhibitors of src family

kinases18,32 that may be of use in targeting pancreatic
tumor growth and metastases, with an emphasis on combination therapies with standard chemotherapeutic
agents.16,17 as shown by duxbury et al,16  xxxg2198xxx  inhibition
may serve the dual function of increasing the sensitivity of
pancreatic tumors to established chemotherapeutic
agents and inhibiting the ability of these tumors to metastasize. together with the results presented here, these
data suggest the possibility that  xxxg2198xxx  represents an
important candidate for targeted therapy in pancreatic
cancer.
