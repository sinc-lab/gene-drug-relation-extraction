abstract
the rates of inhibition of mouse acetylcholinesterase (ache) ( xxxg38xxx ) by paraoxon,
haloxon, ddvp, and enantiomers of neutral alkyl methylphosphonyl thioates and cationic
alkyl methylphosphonyl thiocholines were measured in the presence and absence of ache
peripheral site inhibitors:  xxxd2174xxx ,  xxxd3456xxx ,  xxxd3027xxx , atropine and derivatives of
coumarin. all ligands, except the coumarins, at submillimolar concentrations enhanced the
rates of inhibition by neutral organophosphorus compounds (ops) while inhibition rates by
cationic ops were slowed down. when peripheral site ligand concentrations extended to
millimolar, the extent of the enhancement decreased creating a bell shaped activation profile.
analysis of inhibition by ddvp and haloxon revealed that peripheral site inhibitors
increased the second order reaction rates by increasing maximal rates of phosphylation.

1. introduction
while most ligands interacting with acetylcholinesterase (ache)( xxxg38xxx )
studied to date,are either its substrates or inhibitors, some inhibitors, of acetylthiocholine hydrolysis can accelerate hydrolysis of certain neutral substrates. for
example, enzymic hydrolysis of a series of small neutral acetates is accelerated in
the presence of n-methyl acridinium cation [1]. also, binding of small cationic
ligands, such as tetramethyl- and tetraethyl- ammonium into the ache active
center was shown to increase rates of ache acylation by carbamyl and sulfonyl
fluorides [2,3]. the acceleration of reaction of these neutral acylating agents with
ache appears to require both the acylating ligand and accelerating cation to be
small, allowing for their simultaneous association in the ache active center gorge.
in this study we have examined the acceleration effect by peripheral site ligands on
the rate of phosphylation of mouse ache with neutral organophosphates.

2. results and discussion
rate constants for phosphylation of wildtype mouse ache by paraoxon were
increased in the presence of ache peripheral site inhibitors:  xxxd2174xxx , dtubocurarine,  xxxd3027xxx  and atropine (fig. 1) whereas derivatives of coumarin
reduced the rates of phosphylation (data not shown).  xxxd3456xxx  and  xxxd2174xxx 
were the best accelerators increasing the original reaction rates 5- to 10-fold at
optimal (about 1 mm) concentrations of accelerator. phosphylation by, ddvp,
haloxon and enantiomers of neutral alkyl methylphosphonyl thioates followed
similar activation pattern. however, both active center and peripheral site reversible
ligands reduced rates of phosphylation by cationic alkyl methylphosphonyl thiocholines and other cationic organophosphates (data not shown).
the phosphylation by chiral, neutral, alkyl methylphosphonyl thioates was
accelerated similarly for both s and r enantiomers (data not shown). also,
phosphylation by charge chiral methylphosphonyl thiocholines was reduced to a
similar extent for both enantiomers. thus, binding of peripheral site ligands does
not affect the enantiomer preference for reactions with organophosphates.
acylation of ache by symmetric organophosphates, haloxon and ddvp revealed formation of a reversible complex (fig. 2a and fig. 3a). this formation can
occur through two distinct mechanisms [4] described by schemes 1 and 2, where k1

scheme 1.

scheme 2.

is the second order rate constant of association of an organophosphate (op) with
the enzyme (e) into reversible complex (e*op), k − 1 is the first order rate constant
of dissociation of that complex, k2 is the first order reaction constant for formation
of a phosphorylated enzyme (e – op), and ki is the overall second order phosphylation rate constant.
the two schemes differ in the site of reversible op binding on ache. the
reversible complex in scheme 1 forms in the active center preceeding the covalent
binding and is defined by the following expression:

 xxxd2174xxx , atropine and  xxxd3027xxx  concentrations. the acceleration is expressed as a ratio of the first
order inhibition rate constant of ache with paraoxon in presence of an activator (ka) and in its absence
(k).

the complex in scheme 2 forms outside ache active center and is defined by:

acylation of ache by ddvp in the presence of  xxxd2174xxx  (fig. 2a) consistent
with scheme 1 resulted in increased k2 and no change in ki for ddvp, suggesting
that binding of peripheral site ligand  xxxd2174xxx  primarily affects stability of
transition state in ache phosphylation.
experiments of competition of haloxon with acetylthiocholine [4] and  xxxd3027xxx 
[5] suggest that haloxon reversibly binds at the ache peripheral site and reacts
according to scheme 2. increasing  xxxd2174xxx  concentrations increased ka and ki for
haloxon (fig. 3). the increase in ka is caused by the same range of  xxxd2174xxx 
concentrations that activate haloxon acylation and is consistent with the overlap of
its binding site with the  xxxd2174xxx  binding site.
phosphylation of ache active center (y337a) and peripheral site (w286a)
mutants maintained the acceleration profiles in the presence of peripheral site

 xxxd3456xxx  (ka) and in its absence (k).

ligands found for wildtype enzyme (fig. 4). however, the amino acid substitutions
at the peripheral site (w286a) reduced magnitude of enhancement of paraoxon
phosphylation where acylation rates were reduced, and shifted towards higher
accelerating ligand concentrations (fig. 4). selective substitutions at the choline
binding subsite in the active center (y337a) increased the magnitude of enhancement of inhibition achieved with peripheral site ligands (fig. 4). simultaneous
substitution of choline binding subsite and acyl pocket residues in the double
mutant f295l/y337a resulted in about two orders of magnitude higher bimolecular reaction rate constants for paraoxon inhibition in the presence of accelerating
ligand.

3. conclusion
in summary, the acceleration of ache acylation by neutral organophosphates
can be interpreted in terms of the accelerating ligand binding to an allosteric site.
binding of a peripheral site ligand on the surface of the enzyme enhances the rate
of acylation occuring in its active center. presumably, this occurs through influencing a change in conformation, involving orientation of the leaving group of the
organophosphate. the chiral preference of the organophosphate reaction is not
dependent on the leaving group [6]. thus, as suggested in previous studies [7], the
peripheral site at the surface of the enzyme, appears linked to the active center
through allosteric mediated changes in conformation.
