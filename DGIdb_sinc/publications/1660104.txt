summary.  xxxd204xxx  is a class ib antiarrhythmic agent.
we studied effects of  xxxd204xxx  (3 gmol/1) on the na +
current using whole cell voltage clamp (tip resistance=0.5 m~, [na]i ando= 10retool/1 at 18°c).
 xxxd204xxx  revealed tonic block (kdrest= 37.7 gmol/1,
kdi = 0.74 gmol/1; n = 4).  xxxd204xxx , shifted inactivation curve to hyperpolarizing direction by 11.4+3.5 mv
(n = 4) without changes in slope factor. in the presence of
3 gmol/1  xxxd204xxx ,  xxxd204xxx  showed phasic block, i.e.,
duration-dependent block at 2 hz (64°70+_3% at 1.5 ms,
82%_+6% at 20ms, 93°7o+7% at 200ms; n = 4). short
single prepulse also produced  xxxd204xxx -induced phasic
block (12% at 1.5 ms, 22% at 100 ms; n = 2). after removal of fast inactivation of na + current by 3 mmol/1
tosylchloramide sodium,  xxxd204xxx  revealed phasic block,
independent of holding potential. the recovery time constant from  xxxd204xxx -induced phasic block was 4.8 s at
holding potential = - 100 mv and 5.0 s at holding potential = -140 mv. this use-dependent block of  xxxd204xxx 
had ph dependency. under acidic condition (ph 6.0),
3 gmol/1  xxxd204xxx  showed smaller use-dependent block
(1.4°70 +7% at 2 hz; n = 4) comparing with either at ph
7,4 (68% +-13%; n = 4) or at ph 8.0 (90% + 12°70; n = 4).
the results suggest that  xxxd204xxx  could bind to the
receptor via activation process through channel pore, resulting in decrease of na + current, and egress from the
receptor through the lipid bilayer. these effects might be
attenuated under acidic condition due to changes in intracellular ratio of charged to neutralized form of drug
molecule.

introduction
 xxxd204xxx  is a relatively new antiarrhythmic agent available for the treatment of both supraventricular and vensend offprint requests to: r. sato at the above address

tricular arrhythmias (kesteloot et al. 1973). experimental
results showed that 1)  xxxd204xxx  decreases the upstroke
velocity of depolarization of action potential (vmax) and
conduction velocity in all cardiac tissues (steinberg and
greenspan 1976), 2)  xxxd204xxx  decreases ~rmax in a rateand voltage-dependent manner, implying that  xxxd204xxx 
could depress the sodium channels (in~) (toyama et al.
1987; hisatome et al. 1988). however, the mechanism by
which  xxxd204xxx  blocks ina has nnot yet been investigated. we, therefore, carried out whole-cell voltage clamp experiments to elucidate the blocking mechanisms of  xxxd204xxx  on ina in guinea-pig ventricular myocytes, applying
our data to the modulated receptor hypothesis
(hondeghem and katzung 1977).

materials and methods
single guinea-pig ventricular myocytes were isolated by a described enzymatic dissociation technique (powell et al. 1980; ehara et al. 1989).
sodium current of single ventricular cells were recorded using whole cell
clamp technique. the chamber was continuously perfused at a temperature of 17 °c with low sodium bathing solution of the following composition (mmol/1):  xxxg2020xxx  10; csc1 5; caci 2 1.8; mgc12 0.5; d-glucose 11;
hepes 20;  xxxd3337xxx  chloride 125; and titrated to a ph
of 7.4 with 1 mmol/1  xxxd3337xxx  (tma)-hydroxide. for the
experiments with using tosylchloramide sodium, the following composition (mmol/1) of bathing solution were used:  xxxg2020xxx  50; csci 5; cac12
1.8; mgc12 0.5; coc12 1.0;  xxxd3337xxx  chloride 90; hepes
20; glucose 11 and ph was adjusted to 7.4 with tma hydroxide. for
making the acidic or alkalic condition, we added the appropriate
amount of hydrochloride or tma hydroxide to the bathing solution.
the solution inside the suction pipette contained (mmol/1): csf 145;
naf 10; hepes 5; and was titrated to a ph of 7.2 with 1 mmol/1
csoh. use of these solution allowed the effective isolation of ina from
other ionic currents. the pipette had tip resistances less than 0.5 md.
series resistance was compensated for empirically by applying series resistance compensation to speed the decay of capacitive transients. after
compensation, capacitive transients were completed within 500 gs. the
membrane current signal was recorded on videotapes (video recorder,
mitsubishi hv-f73, mitsubishi, japan) through a pcm converter
(shoshin em, pcm-dpi6, shoshin, japan) for later computer analysis
(nec pc98xl, nec, japan). several criteria have been outlined to
permit indirect determination of the adequacy of space-clamp control

332
in cardiac preparation. under our experimental conditions (hisatome et
al. 1987, 1989), current recordings from isolated myocytes satisfied the
criteria described by colatsky and tsien (1979).
it is known that the block of antiarrhythmic drug may be composed
of tonic block and phasic block. to study the tonic block, at low pulse
frequency (0.01 hz), sufficient to ensure full recovery from rate-dependent block of ina, the drug-induced decrease in ina was defined as tonic block. the amount of tonic block was calculated as pelcent decrease
in ina after perfusion with drug with respect to the control. to study
the phasic block, a rest of 180 s was interposed between the trains of
stimuli. ina decreased during a pulse train and reached a new steady
state. the amount of phasic block is calculated as percent decrease in
ina in the new steady state with respect to that of the first pulse
(hisatome et al. 1990).
in order to determine either decay time constant of ina or the time
constant of recovery kinetics from phasic block of ina, using computer,
the data were fitted to the sum of double exponential function having
the form of
ina = a exp (-t/tf)+ b exp (-t/ts)+c

(1)

where a, b, and c were constant, t r and t s were the time constant of either fast or slow phase, respectively.
in case of analyzing the recovery time constant of recovery kinetics,
we focused on just the slow phase of recovery kinetics. to summarize
the multiple data, we expressed the value as arithmetical mean _+ sem.

drugs used in this study. tosylchloramidesodium (chloramine-t)was
obtained from sigma chemical co (st. louis, mo, usa).  xxxd204xxx 
hydrochloride was kindly supplied by mitsui pharmaceutical co. ltd.
(tokyo, japan).

and huxlex 1952). under control condition, v h was
- 83.5 mv and k was 6.7, and in the presence of 3 ~tmol/l
 xxxd204xxx , v h was -94.7 mv and k was 6.7. from the
data obtained from 4 experiments, 3 ~tmol/1  xxxd204xxx 
shifted the ina inactivation curve by -11.4_+3.5 mv to
hyperpolarized direction along the voltage axis without
changes in slope factor.

(closed circles) and - 9 4 . 7 mv in the presence of 3 umol/1  xxxd204xxx 

(closed triangles)

from 1.5 to 3000 ms with respect to the control ina, i.e.,
without prepulse in the presence of 3 ~mol/1  xxxd204xxx .
even a short prepulse such as 1.5 and 5 ms could produce
the same amount of phasic block as a longer prepulse
such as 60 and 100 ms. it is of interest that a prepulse
longer than 200 ms enhanced the phasic block remarkably. above results suggest that the fast inactivation process might not be needed to reveal the  xxxd204xxx -induced
phasic block. in order to confirm this possibility, we examined whether phasic block could be induced by  xxxd204xxx  after removal of fast inactivation by tosylchloramide
sodium, which is well-known to remove the fast inactiva-

phasic block by  xxxd204xxx 
lna

in addition to tonic block,  xxxd204xxx  showed a phasic
block of ina. the inset ( a - c ) in fig. 5 shows ina elicited
by the first depolarizing pulse at 2 hz from h p =
-140
mv to - 2 0 mv (open circles) and 20th pulse (closed circles) in the presence of 3 gmol/l  xxxd204xxx , of which
durations varied from 1.5 to 200 ms. the 1.5-ms train
pulse (inset(a)) produced almost the same degree of phasic block as 20 ms (inset(b)) and 200 ms (inset(c)). panel
(d) shows the per cent of phasic block (n = 4) at 2 hz by
a train pulse of 1.5, 20, 100, 200 ms in the presence of
3 gmol/1  xxxd204xxx .
these results suggest that the onset of phasic block
might be fast. therefore, this possibility was tested as follows, using a two-pulse protocol. a prepulse (the duration of which varied from 1.5 to 3000 ms) to - 2 0 mv
from h p = - 140 mv was followed by a 1.0-s recovery period and a test pulse to - 2 0 mv from h p = - 140 mv to
assess current recovery. figure 6 shows the per cent of onset of block (n = 2) following prepulse duration varying

of 5.0 s. same results were obtained from 3 experiments.

effects of extracellular p h on phasic block
by  xxxd204xxx 
it is well known that extracellular ph influences phasic
block of sodium channels produced by antiarrhythmic
agents (grant et al. 1980). therefore, we studied the effect of extracellular ph on phasic block induced by
 xxxd204xxx .
inset (a) in fig. 9 shows the original current traces
elicited by the 1st (open circle) and 20th (closed circle)
test pulses to - 2 0 mv at 2 hz from h p = - 1 4 0 mv in
the presence of 3 gmol/l  xxxd204xxx  at ph = 8.0. repetitive depolarizing pulses at 2 hz produced a phasic block
of ina, resulting in complete block at 20th pulse. in contrast, at ph = 6.0, a pulse train at 2 hz produced a smaller degree of phasic block, resulting in 24 per cent block
at 20th pulse, as shown in inset (b). panel (c) shows per
cent of phasic block at each extacellular ph, obtained
from 4 experiments. under more acidic condition, the degree of phasic block decreased even in the presence of
 xxxd204xxx .
discussion

in the present study, we found that  xxxd204xxx  decreased
the ina of guinea-pig ventricular myocytes in either a
steady state, i.e., tonic block, or use dependently, i.e., phasic block, and also shifted the na ÷ inactivation curve to
a hyperpolarizing direction. the time constant for the decay of capacitive transients did not change before and after administration of  xxxd204xxx , so that the shift of inactivation curve was not due to a voltage drop across the residual series resistance. according to the modulated receptor theory (hondeghem and katzung 1977), (1) drugs
bind to a receptor site in or very close to the sodium channel, (2) the affinity of the receptor for the drugs is modulated by the channel state: rested, inactivated and activated, (3) drug-associated channels differ from the drug-free
channels in that they do not conduct, and their ability to
be activated is shifted to a more negative potential. it is
known that the tonic block is composed of a rested and
an inactivated state block. in order to determine kdrest,
the dissociation constant for binding to the rested state,
and kdi, the dissociation constant for binding to the inactivated state, we used the following equation (bean et
al. 1983):
1/kdap p = h/kdrest + (1 - h)/kd i

(4)

where h is the fraction of channels in the rested state in
the absence of drug. our calculation showed that kdapp
was 3.2 gmol/l, kdrest was 37.7 pmol/1, and kdi was
0.74 ~tmol/1. in order to confirm our calculation, we applied our data to the following equation (bean et al.
1983):

dv h = k in [(1 + [dl/kdrest)/(1 + [dl/kdi)l

(5)

where dv h is the shift of the inactivation curve, k is the
slope factor of the inactivation curve and [d] is the drug
concentration. the hyperpolarizing shift in the presence
of 3 gmol/1  xxxd204xxx  calculated was 9.8 mv, which is
very close to the experimental data (11.4 mv). these results suggest that  xxxd204xxx  has a higher affinity to the inactivated than to the rested state, which results in a decrease of the number of the sodium channels available
under steady state condition.
similar to the other class i antiarrhythmic agents,
 xxxd204xxx  also revealed a phasic block of ina. in the
presence of  xxxd204xxx , a brief single pulse or a train of
brief conditioning pulses which activates na + channels
with minimal inactivation, could produce phasic block of
ina. especially, onset block by using a two-pulse protocol revealed that phasic block associated with prepulse
depolarization was composed of two phase, i.e., an early
phase less than 100ms and a late phase longer than
100 ms. these results suggest that  xxxd204xxx  also appears
to have an affinity to the activated and/or fast inactivated
state, in addition to the high affinity to the inactivated
and/or slow inactivated state. thereby, we tested whether
 xxxd204xxx  has an affinity to activated state or fast inactivated state by means of removal of fast inactivation by
tosylchloramide sodium. tosylchloramide sodium is
known to inhibit the fast inactivation process of na ÷
channel (wang 1984; wang et al. 1985, 1987; schmidtmayer 1985; schmidtmayer et al. 1983; meeder et al.
1987). since tosylchloramide sodium has no proteolytic
activity, modification of drug receptor or structural
changes in receptor would not occur in tosylchloramide
sodium treated cells (wang et al. 1987). tosylchloramide
sodium was used to remove the fast inactivation process
of ina in nerve preparations (ulbricht and stoye-herzog
1984; huang et al. 1987; wang et al. 1987) and cardiac
myocytes (miyamoto et al. 1989). after removal of fast
inactivation,  xxxd204xxx  also revealed the phasic block of
ina, independently of the holding potentials, which indicates that  xxxd204xxx  blocks ina at least partially due to
binding to the activated state.
the time course of recovery from phasic block might
show the unbinding process of the agent from the receptor either through the hydrophilic or the hydrophobic
pathway. the receptor site for local anaesthetics has been
suggested to lie within the channel lumen, and drug
would egress from the receptor either through the hydrophilic pathway i.e., through the pore, or the hydrophobic
pathway, i.e., through the lipid layer (hille 1977). the hydrophilic pathway is used only by the charged form of the
drug, which is favoured by low molecular weight, and the
hydrophobic pathway is used only by the neutral form of
the drug, which is favoured by lipid solubility estimated
by log p (log of the n-octanol: water partition coefficient
(bean 1984; hille 1977).  xxxd204xxx  has a higher value of
log p (4.2) (courtney 1987; kodama et al. 1990). in the
present study, the time course of recovery from the phasic
block has not been affected by the membrane potential,
which suggested that  xxxd204xxx  might use the hydrophobic pathway, because the dissociation of the charged form

336

of the drug from the receptor using the hydrophobic
pathway should be affected by the changes in the energy
barrier height of the channel pore derived from changing
the membrane potential. the dissociation of the neutral
form of the drug from the recetor through the hydrophobic pathway could be calculated by the following equation:
1/ip = 10pka/kp

(6)

where 1/ip is the life time of the charged form of the
drug, kp is the protonation rate constant of 5 × 108/m/s
(schwartz et al. 1977), and pka is the ph where 50 per
cent of the drug molecules are in the charged form. pk a
value is 9.2 in  xxxd204xxx  (courtney 1987), therefore, the
predicted values of lifetime were 3.2 s, which is close to
the experimental data (4.8 s). also the recovery time constant of ina in the presence of  xxxd204xxx  was voltage-independent, which is in favour of  xxxd204xxx  using the hydrophobic pathway, because the protonation rate constant of the drug is voltage-independent.
it is of interest that the extracellular ph remarkably
affected the  xxxd204xxx -induced phasic block of ina,
which might be related to the capability of  xxxd204xxx  penetrating the cell membrane from the outside of the membrane. the capability of the drug to penetrate the membrane is dependent on the ratio of neutral to charged
form of the drug mediated by the extracellular ph calculated by the henderson-hasselbalch equation:
ph = pk a +log[n]/[c]

(7)

where [n] means the concentration of the neutral form of
the drug and [c] means the concentration of the charged
form of the drug (grant et al. 1980). in the case of  xxxd204xxx , the ratio of neutral to charged form of  xxxd204xxx  is
approximately 10% to 90% at a ph of 8.0 and 1% to
99°70 at a ph of 6.0. above information is in favour of
our present data that lower extracellular ph attenuated
the  xxxd204xxx -induced phasic block of ina.
in conclusion,  xxxd204xxx  could bind to the receptor
during activation process, i.e., through the channel pore,
resulting in a decrease of ina and egress from the receptor through the lipid bilayer, resulting in independence of
the changes in energy barrier height of the channel pore.
