summary

serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine ; 5-ht) is found in the enteric nervous
system where it has been implicated in controlling gastrointestinal motor
function. a number of receptor or recognition sites have been identified
in the gut, but recently most attention has focused on the 5-ht3 and
 xxxg1117xxx  receptors. the functional role of the  xxxg1116xxx  remains
incompletely understood, but it is probably involved in the modulation
of colonic motility and visceral pain in the gut. a number of selective
5-ht3 antagonists have been developed including ondansetron,
granisetron,  xxxd3451xxx   xxxd3097xxx  and zacopride. while the substituted
benzamide prokinetics (for example, metoclopramide,  xxxd1708xxx ) also
block 5-ht3 receptors in high concentrations, their prokinetic action is
believed to be on the basis of their agonist effects on the putative  xxxg1117xxx 
receptor. some 5-ht3 antagonists have  xxxg1117xxx  agonist activity (for
example,  xxxd3097xxx , zacopride) and others do not (for example,
ondansetron, granisetron), while  xxxd3451xxx  in high concentrations
is a  xxxg1117xxx  antagonist. based on the pharmacological data, it has been

suggested that specific 5-ht antagonists and agonists may prove to be
beneficial in a number of gastrointestinal disorders including the irritable
bowel syndrome, functional dyspepsia, non-cardiac chest pain, gastrooesophageal reflux and refractory nausea. in this review, the rationale for
the use of these compounds is discussed, and the available experimental
evidence is summarized.

introduction
in the past 5 years, there has been a surge of interest in the pharmacological actions
of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-ht; serotonin) agonists and antagonists in the gut. it is
now recognized that there are probably four main serotonin receptors : 5-ht,
(including several subtypes), 5-ht,, 5-ht3 and  xxxg1117xxx .’the recent development of
selective serotonin agonists and antagonists holds promise for the treatment of a
wide range of functional gastrointestinal disorders for which efficacious therapies
are generally lacking.’r3 here, the potential clinical relevance of 5-ht-receptor
agonists and antagonists in the gut will be reviewed. first, however, some understanding of the physiological role of 5-ht in the gut and its receptors is required.
phy si 0 l 0 g i c al a c t i o n s 0 f 5-hy d r 0 xy try p t a m ine
the gut has a dual extrinsic innervation from the autonomic nervous system that
regulates gastrointestinal function; however, it is now recognized that neural
control is more complex than just a balance between parasympathetic cholinergic
activity and sympathetic noradrenergic activity. the enteric nervous system also
modulates gut function; it is made up of about one million neurones in the
myenteric plexus (situated between the longitudinal and circular muscle layers) and
the submucous plexus (between the mucosa and circular muscle).’ the neurones
here contain many neurotransmitters including 5-ht. indeed, almost a11 of the
5-ht in the body is found in the gastrointestinal tract, where it is located in the
interneurones that terminate in the myenteric and submucosal plexuses, and in
enterochromaffin cells; once released, 5-ht can act as a neurotransmitter or a local
hormone.’f4release of 5-ht can be induced by stimulating nerve fibres including
the vagus’ or by applying pressure to the m u c o ~ a . ~ ’ ~
agonist studies have implicated 5-ht in motor control of the gut, but how
5-ht modulates gut function in health is still not well understood.’t4 in bowel
preparations, 5-ht indirectly causes smooth muscles to contract because it stimulates acetylcholine release from excitatory (cholinergic) neurones ; 5-ht also
directly activates smooth muscle cell contraction but this may be less important in
promoting intestinal p e r i s t a l ~ i ~ . ~ ’for
~ ’ ~example,
’’
biilbring and lin have shown
that 5-ht applied to the mucosal surface of guinea pig small bowel in vitro initiated
propulsion ; similarly, pressure applied to the mucosa also initiated this response.6 it
was then hypothesized that release of 5-i-it from enterochromaffin cells in response
to pressure was a physiological stimulus of intestinal peristalsis. others have

s e r o t o n i n a n d m o t i l i t y 275

demonstrated in vitvo that 5-ht stimulated acetylcholine release in the submucosa
of the guinea-pig small intestine in a dose-dependent manner, and this response
was modulated by neuropeptides including somatostatin.' 5-ht has been shown
to induce contraction of the guinea-pig colon" as well as increase the myoelectrical
spike activity in the dog small intestine.''r1'
paradoxically, 5-ht can also inhibit acetylcholine release from the presynaptic
cholinergic nerves that terminate on ganglion cell^.'^^'^ 5-ht can also inhibit
intestinal peristalsis ; when applied serosally to the guinea-pig small bowel, for
~~
in other studies it had no effect.6
example, it inhibited p r o p u l s i ~ nalthough
to complicate matters, 5-ht interacts with a number of different receptors at
various sites that are either stimulatory or inhibitory, as will be discussed below.
the physiological action of 5-ht in the gut probably depends on the net release of
acetylcholine, that in turn is related to different actions of 5-ht at many different
sites in the enteric nervous system. it is therefore not surprising that the physiological functions of 5-ht are still being determined.
based on animal studies, it has been suggested that 5-ht may play an important
role in controlling inhibition and facilitation of motor functions of the oesophagus,
stomach, small bowel, ileocolonic sphincter and colon, as well as modulating small
intestinal and colonic secretiodt l3,
(table 1).for example, in an in-vivo rat
model, the migrating motor complex was disrupted into bursts following treatment
with neurotoxins that selectively destroyed serotonin-containing neurones in the
myenteric plexus." however, studies in vivo of 5-ht receptor blockers have usually
failed to demonstrate very dramatic effects in healthy volunteers,' suggesting that
5-ht may modulate gut function in complex but subtle ways. the gastrointestinal

motor effects in man, for example, probably depend in part on the basal tone and
time after a meal.'
stimulatory and inhibitory neurotransmitters released from the enteric nervous
system including 5-ht may also be altered in disease models. for example, in
animals rendered diabetic, 5-ht in colonic myenteric neurones is de~reased,~'

5-ht1-likeresponses are antagonized by  xxxd2621xxx  or methiothepin but not by
selective 5-ht receptor antagonists described below.34 a number of subtypes
(5-ht1,, 5-ht1,, 5-ht1,, 5-htid,and 5-htip)are recognized based on radioligand
binding assays and functional studies.'f4the actions of 5-ht1-like-receptorsin the

5-ht2 receptors
gaddum & picarelli in 1957 first suggested that serotonin receptors located on
guinea pig ileum smooth muscle cells could be blocked by phenoxybenzamine
(dibenzyline) and that serotonin mediated depolarization of intramural cholinergic
neurones could be blocked by morphine.8 they inferred that distinct serotoninreceptor subtypes existed, and they referred to the former as the d-receptor
(blocked by phenoxybenzamine) and the latter as the m-receptor (blocked by
morphine). while it has been suggested that neither phenoxybenzamine or morphine truly act on 5-ht receptors (phenoxybenzamine is an  xxxd3249xxx  that
nonspecifically blocks smooth muscle responses while morphine antagonizes
acetylcholine release),' the classification has proven to be useful, and the d-receptor
is now designated as the 5-ht,-re~eptor.~,
5-ht,-receptor responses are antagonized by  xxxd2419xxx  or ritanserin ; although
the 5-ht, and 5-ht,,-receptors appear to be different structurally, they are similar

pharmacologically.' when 5-ht2-receptors are stimulated directly they cause contraction of some gastrointestinal smooth muscle and gut vascular smooth
selective 5-ht2agonists have now been developed (for example, sk & f 103 829,
which stimulates contraction of the lower oesophageal ~phincter).~'
the physiological actions of the 5-ht, and 5-ht2 receptors has remained
poorly defined because of a lack of adequate selective antagonists.' the clinical
relevance of 5-ht, and 5-ht2-receptor blockade must therefore await further
pharmacological research.

s-ht,-receptors
the m-receptor described by gaddum & picarelli has now been reclassified as the
5 - h t , - r e ~ e p t o r (table
~ ~ ' ~ ~2). these are located on postsynaptic enteric and sensory
neurones, as well as on enteric neuronal membranes, in the vagus, on gastric
endocrine glands, and in the central nervous
their functional role
remains to be completely elucidated, but 5-ht3 receptors are implicated in the
modulation of cholinergic transmission in the neural pathways of the gut. thus, 5ht,-receptors facilitate the release of acetylcholine in the enteric nervous system.'
in myenteric neurones, 5-ht can produce fast and slow depolarization responses ;
the former are mediated by the 5-ht3receptor.*'
subsequently, highly selective antagonists were developed (and new more
potent ones are still appearing) ; currently available 5-ht3 antagonists include
ondansetron (formerly  xxxd2789xxx  f), granisetron (formerly brl 43694),  xxxd3451xxx

figure 2. pathways involved in cytotoxic and radiation-induced emesis: role of 5hydroxytryptamine (5-ht). it is hypothesized that  xxxd1709xxx  and other cytotoxic agents cause
release of 5-ht and perhaps other neuroactive agents (eg. cholecystokinin, vasoactive intestinal
peptide) which act locally on chemoreceptors or mechanoreceptors in the gut wall to activate the
vagus and then the vomiting centre directly or via the area postrema. 5-ht could also act by
entering the portal circulation. adapted &om ref. 95, with permission.

the effects
of other 5-ht3antagonists on acid secretion is unknown.

s-ht,-receptors
it was soon recognized that some of the 5-ht3 antagonists, rather than reducing
cholinergic neurone transmission, actually facilitated these response^.^^^^^^^ for
example,  xxxd3097xxx , metoclopramide and tisapride were shown to induce rather
than inhibit slow depolarization responses in myenteric neurones, imitating the
action of 5-ht.42metoclopramide has also been shown, like 5-ht, to increase the
output of [3h]acetylcholine from electrically stimulated myenteric neurones ; this
stimulation was inhibited by desensitization of 5-ht receptor^.^^ these paradoxical

findings appear to have been partially resolved with the recognition of the 5-ht4receptor (table 2).

structural or biochemical explanation; the bowel disturbance may manifest as
predominant constipation or diarrhoea, or an alternating bowel pattern may occur.61
while the pathophysiology is poorly understood, it is recognized that many
patients have an excessively sensitive colon; in the rectum, for example, balloon
distension typically induces pain in irritable bowel syndrome at a lower threshold
than in controls, even though the extra-intestinal pain threshold (e.g. to ice water
immersion) is the same or higher than in healthy subjects.62patients with irritable
bowel syndrome may also in some cases have a reduced tolerance to gas infusion
into the small
and the threshold for perception of intestinal contraction
may be lower than n ~ ~ a l .furthermore,
64
some patients with diarrhoea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome have accelerated small bowel or colonic transit.65
5-ht3-receptor blockade has been convincingly demonstrated to slow colonic
50 this
transit in healthy man44'45 and may also reduce visceral hypersensiti~ity.~~<
class of compounds is therefore currently undergoing clinical trials in irritable bowel
syndrome but the results have been mixed.
prior & read studied 12 patients with irritable bowel syndrome; granisetron or
placebo was given intravenously.66they found that granisetron produced a dosedependent reduction in rectal sensitivity to balloon distension in the rectum
(manifest by a reduced desire to defecate and urgency) but did not alter rectal
compliance, suggesting that the blockade of ei-ht,-receptors on afferent gut
neurones may be beneficial in irritable bowel syndrome. steadman et al. reported in
a double-blind crossover trial of ondansetron (16 mg 3 times a day) in 11 patients
with diarrhoea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome that stool consistency
improved compared with placebo in one month.67 however, stool frequency,
abdominal pain and global well-being were not significantly altered. ondansetron
49r

282

n. j. talley

had no effect on gastric emptying or small intestinal transit in irritable bowel
syndrome. of interest, while there was a trend for colonic transit to be reduced
with ondansetron compared with placebo in irritable bowel syndrome, the effect
was iess striking than that observed in healthy volunteers. similar results were
reported in preliminary form in another placebo-controlled crossover trial where
50 patients were treated with ondansetron (4 mg 3 times daily); stools became
firmer on active treatment, but abdominal pain and distension did not significantly
improve.68
carcinoid syndrome
in the carcinoid syndrome, diarrhoea is a common problem affecting 70% of
patients ; steatorrhoea can also occur.69carcinoid tumors produce a multitude of
peptides and amines, but indirect evidence suggests that 5-ht may be the primary
. ~ ~ medications that
humoral mediator of diarrhoea by stimulating ~ e c r e t i o nthus,
release 5-ht can exacerbate diarrhoea while drugs that block the peripheral effects
of synthesis of 5-ht sometimes reduce
it has also been shown that
colonic transit is accelerated in carcinoid diarrhoea.73while somatostatin analogues,
which inhibit many peptide hormones, significantly improve diarrhoea in carcinoid
syndrome, their efficacy often decreases with time necessitating increasing doses,
and they may aggravate steatorrhoea (because of pancreatic exocrine i n h i b i t i ~ n ) . ~ ~
therefore, there is a need to develop other therapeutic modalities.
in three patients with carcinoid syndrome, the 5-ht3 antagonist  xxxd3451xxx 
reduced stool frequency in all cases7' while in another open study it controlled
diarrhoea in five of six cases. 76  xxxd2419xxx , a 5-ht, antagonist, improved diarrhoea
as 5-ht may cause diarrhoea by different
in two of seven patients in one
mechanisms in individual patients, controlled trials are now needed to explore the
efficacy of selective 5-ht receptor antagonists in the carcinoid syndrome.

dyspepsia
dyspepsia, defined as pain or discomfort centred in the upper a b d ~ m e n , ~com'
monly occurs in the absence of a structural or biochemical explanation for the
symptoms. patients with functional dyspepsia comprise a heterogeneous group ;
many have symptoms suggestive of a disturbance of upper gastrointestinal motility
including early satiety, nausea and upper abdominal bloating, and up to 50% of
patients with functional dyspepsia have a documentable disturbance of gastroduodenal motility." furthermore, an increased visceral sensitivity in the stomach
to balloon distension has been ~bserved,~~-''
although the relationship between
these findings and chronic symptoms remains to be defined.
studies in guinea-pigs showed that pre-treatment with 5-ht3 antagonists
resulted in accelerated gastric emptying.82 however, in man, mixed results have
been reported; ondansetron in two studies did not alter gastric emptying or small
bowel tran~it.'~,'~
o n the other hand,  xxxd3451xxx  has been found either to increase
modestly gastric emptyinga5 or to reduce it in healthy volunteers.86 in anorexia

not prokinetic some of these compounds theoretically may be of benefit in the
subset of patients with functional dyspepsia who have increased visceral sensitivity.
one preliminary study has evaluated 5-ht3-receptor blockade in patients with
functional dyspepsia. maxton et al. studied patients who had both irritable bowel
syndrome and functional dyspeptic symptoms using ondansetron in a crossover
study with placebo; they found that while abdominal pain changed little, postprandial discomfort, flatulence and heartburn significantly improved.68 this improvement was not related to any anxiolytic action of ondansetron.

non-cardiac chest pain
5-ht3-receptorshave not been identified in oesophageal mucosa in man, although
 xxxg1117xxx -receptors have been found in the oesophageal muscularis mucosae of the
rat." visceral nociceptive abnormalities in the oesophagus may contribute to the
and therefore
pain in patients who have chest pain of undetermined aeti~logy,'~
5-ht3-receptor blockers may be of therapeutic benefit in this group of patients.
stark et al. reported in preliminary form that intravenous infusion of ondansetron
reduced the oesophageal sensitivity to balloon distension in 6 of 8 patients with
non-cardiac chest pain; all 8 patients had chest pain reproduced by balloon
distension." the clinical relevance of this observation remains to be determined,
but if confirmed these results suggest that 5-ht3-receptor blockade may provide a
new approach for this disorder.
gastro-oesophageal reflux
pathological acid reflux in the oesophagus may result from a combination of lower
oesophageal sphincter incompetence and impaired acid clearance."^^^ the 5-ht3
antagonist  xxxd3451xxx  in one study of healthy men slightly increased the
amplitude of oesophageal smooth muscle contractions and lower oesophageal
sphincter pressure compared with placebo.93  xxxd3097xxx  was shown in 19 volunteers, including 8 with a hypotensive lower oesophageal sphincter, to increase
significantly lower oesophageal sphincter pressure.94it has also been reported, as
described above, that heartburn was improved by ondansetron therapy,68 but
further studies are required.
nausea
the desire to vomit can be induced by many different stimuli, but there are some
patients who are referred to gastroenterologists with nausea that defies an explanation. serotonin plays an important role in the emetic response induced by
cancer chemotherapy. cytotoxic drugs and radiation are believed to induce release
of 5-ht from enterochromaffin cells in the proximal gut, which in turn act on
serotonin receptors on vagal afferents (and possibly other sites) that stimulate the
vomiting ~ e n t r e (figure
~ ~ , ~ 2).
~ high dose metoclopramide, which has 5-ht3antagonist activity, is often effective for chemotherapy-induced emesis, but controlled trials with ondansetron have reported that control of emesis is superior with

data are lacking on the role of 5-ht3-receptor antagonists in nonchemotherapy induced nausea. in a study of functional dyspepsia and irritable
bowel syndrome, united kingdom investigators noted no improvement of nausea
with ondansetron,68 but these preliminary findings will need to be confirmed.
nielsen ef a!. gave ondansetron to patients with chronic nausea who had delayed
gastric emptying, but symptom responses were not e ~ a l u a t e dcertainly
.~~
currently
available anti-emetics such as metoclopramide have side effect profiles that limit
their usefulness, so the development of safer anti-emetics would be of great value.
conclusions
in the gut in health, motor activity appears to be regulated in part via 5-ht3 and
 xxxg1117xxx  receptors that are present in the enteric nervous system. furthermore, 5 ht,-receptors may also be important in modulating sensory stimuli in disease states
that conceivably might in turn modify motor responses. future studies of drugs
that act as 5-ht3 antagonists and/or  xxxg1117xxx  agonists should lead to a clearer
understanding of the role of 5-ht in health and disease in the gut, and may provide
novel approaches for treating functional gastrointestinal disorders.
