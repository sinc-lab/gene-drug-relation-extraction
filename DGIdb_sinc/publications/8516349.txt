abstract. vinblastine has been demonstrated to inhibit  xxxg456xxx 
(nachr) activity in adrenal chromaffin cells and superior cervical ganglia and to alter
agonist binding affinity to nachr of the electric organ of torpedo californica. in cultured
chromaffin cells, vinblastine (em, 8.9 pm) is significantly more potent than hexamethonium (icm, 16 pm) and  xxxd1820xxx  (icm, 18 pm) and significantly less potent than
 xxxd2877xxx  (i&, 0.6 pm), and  xxxd2550xxx  (em, 0.1 pm)
d- xxxd3456xxx  (icm, 2 a),
in inhibiting nachr-stimulated catecholamine release. these results demonstrate that
vinblastine has moderately potent anti-nachr activity on adrenal nachr. on the other
hand, vinblastine does not interfere with phrenic nerve stimulation of rat diaphragm
musculature in concentrations up to 200 pm. however, in relatively high doses, vinblastine (10-200 pm) produces an increase in baseline tension of diaphragm muscle. this
effect is concentration related (ecw, -88 plbf), reversible, and independent of phrenic
nerve stimulation. the elevation in baseline tension is unaffected by nachr blockade
via d- xxxd3456xxx , but is dependent upon the presence of extracellular calcium. the
results suggest that vinblastine's antinicotinic actions are selective for neuronal-type
nachr and do not extend to nachr of mammalian skeletal muscle. high concentrations
of vinblastine appear to elicit contractures of skeletal muscle that are unrelated to
nachr.

inblastine, a therapeutically useful antineoplastic drug, interferes with cell mitosis by promoting the depolymerization of spindle fiber
microtubules (1). in addition, vinblastine has been
demonstrated to inhibit  xxxg456xxx 
(nachr)-stimulated catecholamine release from perfused bovine adrenal gland (2, 3) and cultured bovine
adrenal chromafin cells (4), to block transmission
through the cat superior cervical ganglion (2), and to
affect binding properties of nachr-rich membrane
preparations from the electric organ of torpedo californica (5). it is not known whether the actions of vinblastine on nachr are related to actions of vinblastine
on microtubules, although evidence in the literature
suggeststhat such a possibility exists in cultured adrenal
chromafin cells (4, 6, 7). however, it has also been

v

suggested that the antimitotic and nachr actions in
these tissues are unrelated (2, 5).
although vinblastine's inhibitory effects on ganglionic transmission and its inhibition of nachr-stimulated release of catecholamines from adrenal glands and
adrenal chromafin cells are documented, it is not
known whether these effects can be generalized to include anticholinergic activity on nachr of mammalian
skeletal muscle. the objectives of the studies reported
here were (i) to compare the antinicotinic actions of
vinblastine on the adrenal nachr to those of several
classical neuromuscular and ganglionic blockers and
(ii) to determine whether vinblastine disrupts nerve
transmission at the skeletal neuromuscular junction. a
preliminary account of this work has been reported
previously (8).

chloride. vinblastine sulfate was a gift from the eli lilly
co. (indianapolis, in). all other reagents, which were
of analytical grade, were obtained from various commercial suppliers.
isolation and primary culture of bovine adrenal
chromaffin cells. bovine adrenal glands were obtained

from herman falter packing co. (columbus, oh) and
used within 30 min of their removal from the carcass.
adrenal chromafin cells were dissociated from the
intact glands, plated, and maintained at 37°c in a
humidified, 5 % c02 environment, as described previously (4, 6).
catecholamine secretion studies. secretion experiments were performed in a physiologic salt solution
containing 2 mmca2+and 0.5% bovine  xxxg124xxx 
(4). when vinblastine was used, cells were pretreated
for 30 min. we have reported previously that pretreatment times between 5 min and 60 min produce the
same maximum inhibition of secretion (4). the ['hi
ne assay, which has been described previously, was
used to monitor catecholamine release from the cultured cells (4). the amount of radioactivity released
during a 10-min period of stimulation was determined
by liquid scintillation spectroscopy. the radioactivity
remaining in the cells was then extracted with 8%
trichloroacetic acid and was also counted. the sum of
the secreted and the trichloroacetic acid-extractable
radioactivity represented total incorporated ['hine.
results were expressed as a percentage of the net stimulated control response where basal (nonstimulated)
fractional release had been subtracted from all groups
(i.e., treatment group release minus basal release divided by control acetylcholine chloride-stimulated release minus basal release x 100).
phrenic nerve-hemidiaphragm preparation. left
phrenic nerve-hemidiaphragm muscles were obtained
from adult sprague-dawley-derived rats and suspended
in 35°c krebs medium (9) aerated with 95% oxygen
and 5% carbon dioxide. a 0.5 g resting tension was
imposed on the muscles and isometric contractions
were recorded via a grass force displacement transducer (f.03) and oscillograph. in some experiments,
the muscles were driven by repetitive (0.5 hz) stimulation of the phrenic nerve (square wave pulses of
1 msec duration at two times threshold voltage).
threshold voltages were 0.1-0.4 v. the basic technique followed the original design of bulbring (10).
drug concentrations were expressed as molar bath
concentrations.
diaphragm strips. strips of rat diaphragm muscle
approximately 4 x 15 mm were mounted in a tissue
bath under conditions identical to those described for
the phrenic nerve-hemidiaphragm preparation, except
that all extrinsic nerves were sectioned and no electrical
excitation was used to stimulate the muscle.
statistical treatment. data were presented as

arithmetic mean & se except for ic50 and ec50 values
which were presented as geometric mean (95% confidence limits). in the secretion studies, n represents the
number of observations carried out in triplicate. sigmoid inhibition and concentration-response curves
were generated by nonlinear regression (inplot 3.1 ;
graphpad software, san diego, ca). experimental
values were compared using analysis of variance and
duncan's multiple range test (1 1) at a 0.05 level of
significance.
results
mammalian adrenal chromaffin cell response.

table i summarized the inhibitor potencies (icsos)of
all drugs examined. duncan's multiple range test revealed that the drugs could be partitioned into three
groups based on potency:  xxxd2550xxx  =  xxxd2877xxx  = d- xxxd3456xxx  > vinblastine > hexamethonium =  xxxd1820xxx . thus, vinblastine occupied
an intermediary position among these nachr receptor
antagonists. in sufficient concentration, all of the inhibitors appeared to be capable of fully reducing the release
of catecholamines from cultured adrenal chromaffin
cells to the basal (nonstimulated) level (fig. 1). vinblastine and the nicotinic receptor antagonists exerted
no influence on basal catecholamine release and their
inhibitory actions were specific for nicotinic receptorstimulated release; i.e., these drugs did not inhibit release stimulated by depolarizing concentrations of potassium (data not shown). these studies demonstrate
that vinblastine possesses anti-nachr potencies in cultured adrenal chromafin cells that are comparable to
those of the more classical anti-nachr drugs.
mammalian skeletal muscle response. to assess
vinblastine's actions on skeletal muscle-type nachr,
the rat phrenic nerve-diaphragm system was examined.
as seen in the oscillograph tracing of figure 2, vinblastine (10-100 p m ) failed to exert any inhibition of
muscle response to phrenic nerve stimulation. however, in these concentrations, vinblastine produced a

graded increase in baseline muscle tension. the rise in
basal tension was accompanied by an equivalent rise in
nerve-stimulated contractile peak height. thus, there
was no net change in the dimensions of the contraction
spike induced by electrical excitation of the phrenic
nerve. the introduction of d- xxxd3456xxx  (1 p m ) gradually reduced and ultimately abolished nerve-stimulated contractions without altering vinblastine-induced
elevation in basal tension. washing the preparation
with krebs medium restored the baseline to near normal. therefore, the vinblastine effect is considered to
be reversible.
the change in basal tension that was observed with
vinblastine also can be elicited in the absence of nerve
stimulation as seen in figure 3. the unstimulated diaphragm strip in panel a (fig. 3) exhibited a dosedependent contraction to cumulative doses of vinblastine (20-200 p m ) . replacing krebs incubating medium
with calcium-free krebs solution prevented the vinblastine effect. the addition of calcium to the calciumfree medium restored vinblastine's ability to elevate

discussion
nicotinic acetylcholine receptors are found in neuromuscular junctions and on neuronal and neural crestderived tissues (e.g., sympathetic ganglia, brain, and
adrenal medulla). although skeletal muscle-type
nachr are fairly well characterized, less is known

about adrenal nachr and other neuronal-type
nachr. pharmacologic similarities between neuronal
and muscle nachr have been described ( 12, 13). other
studies, however, have indicated that these two receptor
types differ in their sensitivities to various nachr
antagonists and neurotoxins ( 14- 16). it is also becoming clear that neuronal nachr differ from muscle
nachr in both structure and regulation (for review,
see ref. 17).
several reports have described the anti-nachr
activity of vinblastine in neuronal tissues (2, 4, 5). we
have demonstrated previously that vinblastine and
other antimitotic drugs affect nachr function in cultured bovine adrenal chromafin cells and that these
effects are noncompetitive (4, 6, 7, 18). this effect of
vinblastine is specific for release stimulated via activation of adrenal nicotinic receptors; i.e., vinblastine does
not inhibit release stimulated by histamine, veratridine,
barium chloride, or depolarizing concentrations of potassium (4). one explanation of vinblastine’s antinachr activity is that vinblastine interferes with
nachr agonist binding. trifaro et al. (2) have demonstrated that vinblastine (100 p m ) not only inhibits
catecholamine release from perfused bovine adrenal
glands, but also blocks transmission through the superior cervical ganglia of the cat. they suggested that this
action reflected anti-nachr activity. mckay et al. (5),
investigating this possibility using the nachr-rich
membrane preparation from t. californica electric
organs, found that vinblastine did not interfere with
[a-1251]bungarotoxinbinding to the nachr agonist
binding site. this suggests that vinblastine had little or
no afinity for nachr binding sites. however, vinblastine had other effects on binding properties to the
torpedo membranes. vinblastine (i) interfered with
binding of [3h]perhydrohistrionicotoxin to the nachrgated ion channel and (ii) stabilized a high affinity
conformation of the nachr complex, a property it
shares with many other noncompetitive inhibitors of
the nachr-gated ion channel.
in the studies reported here, we found that in
adrenal chromafin cells vinblastine has pharmacologic
properties which are similar to other nachr antagonists both in terms of potency and efficacy. classical
ganglionic blockers such as  xxxd2550xxx  and  xxxd2877xxx  tended to be more potent than the classical
skeletal myoneural blockers such as d- xxxd3456xxx  and
 xxxd1820xxx . although nominally classified as a
ganglionic blocker, hexamethonium was virtually identical in potency to that of  xxxd1820xxx . vinblastine’s potency falls within the range of activities of the
other inhibitors.
vinblastine, however, exhibits no anticholinergic
activity at the skeletal neuromuscular junction. its presence, in concentrations up to 200 pm, does not impair
the phrenic nerve-stimulated contraction of the inner-

vated diaphragm muscle. one possible explanation for
these negative results is that under our treatment conditions, vinblastine does not have the opportunity to
reach the nicotinic receptors. however, we believe that
circumstantial evidence makes it unlikely that lack of
access is an explanation for the lack of inhibitory action.
under similar treatment conditions with regard to time
and concentration, vinblastine has been demonstrated
to exert inhibitory actions on the in situ superior cervical ganglia preparation (2). in addition, we have reported previously that pretreatment times of 5 min or
longer produce the same maximum inhibition of adrenal secretion (4). since total vinblastine exposure time
in the diaphragm studies was 10-15 min, the lack of
antinicotinic activity in rat diaphragm is probably not
due to inappropriate treatment conditions.
at high doses, however, vinblastine exerted a direct
concentration-dependent effect on the muscle tissue to
increase resting tension, an effect which is independent
of nachr activity. the mechanism that underlies this
action of vinblastine is unknown. vinblastine has been
reported to possess nonspecific membrane-related actions at high concentrations (4, 19). we do not know
whether similar nonspecific membrane actions underlie
vinblastine’s ability to produce contracture of the diaphragm, but we have found that this effect is reversible
and dependent upon extracellular calcium. vinblastine
has also been reported to possess properties similar to
the noncompetitive inhibitors of the nachr-gated ion
channel such as histrionicotoxin and adiphenine ( 5 ,
1 1). interestingly, colchicine, another antimitotic agent,
has also been found to produce contracture of rat
diaphragm (20). in the latter report, colchicine inhibited
neuromuscular transmission in the isolated frog sciatic
nerve-sartorius muscle preparation but not in the rat
phrenic-nerve diaphragm preparation. these results
suggest that a species dependency may further complicate attempts to discriminate among the activities of
vinblastine on various nachr.
summary and conclusions
1. vinblastine possesses anti-nicotinic receptor potencies in adrenal chromaffin cells that are comparable
to those of the more classical anti-nachr drugs.
2. vinblastine has no demonstrable anticholinergic
receptor activity on rat diaphragm skeletal muscle.
3. vinblastine produces a concentration-related elevation of basal tension in diaphragm muscle (contracture) that is independent of nicotinic receptor function.
this effect requires the presence of extracellular calcium. it remains to be determined whether this effect
is the result of (i) the ion channel-related properties of
vinblastine, (ii) its well-characterized influences on microtubules, or (iii) some heretofore unrecognized pharmacologic attribute of vinblastine.
