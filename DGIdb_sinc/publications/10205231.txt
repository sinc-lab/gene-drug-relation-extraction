abstract—the purpose of this study was to compare the  xxxg99xxx  type 1 receptor antagonist  xxxd417xxx 
(candesartan) and the  xxxg36xxx  inhibitor  xxxd1694xxx  on cardiac function, assessed by doppler
echocardiography and cardiac gene expression associated with cardiac remodeling, in rats with myocardial
infarction. candesartan or  xxxd1694xxx  was administered after myocardial infarction. at 1 and 4 weeks after
myocardial infarction, cardiac function and mrna expression in noninfarcted myocardium were analyzed.
candesartan and  xxxd1694xxx  equally prevented increases in hypertrophy in noninfarcted myocardium, left ventricular
dilatation, and ejection fraction at 4 weeks. the e-wave/a-wave velocity ratio and the rate of e-wave deceleration,
measures of diastolic function, increased to 9.260.6 and 26.362.6 m/s2 at 1 week after myocardial infarction.
candesartan and  xxxd1694xxx , administered at a dose of 1 mg/kg per day, prevented increases in e-wave/a-wave
velocity ratio and e-wave deceleration at 1 and 4 weeks. candesartan and  xxxd1694xxx  significantly suppressed
increased mrna expression of b-myosin heavy chain, a-skeletal actin, and atrial natriuretic peptide in
noninfarcted ventricle at 1 and 4 weeks and expression of collagen i and iii at 4 weeks to a similar extent. when
given at a dose of 10 mg/kg per day, both candesartan and  xxxd1694xxx  prevented cardiac dysfunction and gene
expression to the same extent as when given at 1 mg/kg per day. in conclusion, doppler echocardiography showed
that candesartan and  xxxd1694xxx  equally improved systolic and diastolic function and that ventricular remodeling
accompanied modulation of cardiac gene expression. (hypertension. 1999;33:961-968.)

ngiotensin-converting enzyme (ace) inhibitors reduce
morbidity and mortality in patients with chronic heart
failure and left ventricular dysfunction as well as in patients
who have had a myocardial infarction (mi).1– 4 ace inhibitors may exert a cardioprotective effect by decreasing afterload and preload and by inhibiting the cardiac renin-angiotensin system. orally active, nonpeptide  xxxg99xxx  type 1
(at1) receptor antagonists, such as losartan or candesartan
cilexitil, can block this receptor specifically.5,6 raya et al7
compared the long-term effects of the ace inhibitor captopril
with the direct blockade induced by losartan in a rat model of
mi, and both drugs caused similar hemodynamic changes.
several other investigators have made similar comparisons in
dog and rat models of mi.8 –14 in some of these studies, the
ace inhibitor seemed to be superior to the  xxxg100xxx 
antagonist in preventing ventricular remodeling and hypertrophy,9,12,13 whereas in others the two seemed similar.7,8,10,11,13,14 recently, investigators in the evaluation of
losartan in the elderly (elite) study found that losartan
was, contrary to expectations, associated with lower mortality

than captopril in patients with heart failure.15 on the other
hand, in the resolvd study, a trial comparing candesartan
with enalapril in patients with heart failure, no difference in
effects on clinical events or death between the two drugs was
shown.16 a comparison of the effects of  xxxg100xxx 
antagonists and ace inhibitors on heart failure has not been
performed.
two-dimensional echocardiography allows visualization
of the entire heart through multiple tomographic planes in
real time and has become the noninvasive method of choice
for evaluating chamber size and function. pulsed-wave doppler recordings of atrioventricular valve flow provide valuable
information about diastolic filling of the heart,17 and transthoracic doppler echocardiography has become a powerful
noninvasive method that has been used to provide information about systolic and diastolic function in small-animal
studies.18,19 the present study was undertaken to compare the
effects of an  xxxg100xxx  antagonist ( xxxd417xxx )
and an ace inhibitor ( xxxd1694xxx ) on cardiac dysfunction in
rats after mi. for this purpose, we measured cardiac function

echocardiography and mrna expression

by using doppler echocardiography and ventricular mrna
expression of several genes associated with cardiac
hypertrophy.

methods
experimental protocol
all procedures were in accordance with institutional guidelines for
animal research. male wistar rats weighing 290 to 310 g were
purchased from clea japan, inc (osaka, japan). mi was produced by
ligation of the left anterior descending coronary artery as previously
described.20,21 the same surgical procedures were performed on a
control group of rats (1 week, n58; 4 weeks, n58) except that the
suture around the coronary artery was not tied. rats that survived 24
hours after surgery were randomly separated into treated and
untreated groups (mi groups: 1 week, n59; 4 weeks, n58). treated
rats were orally administered  xxxd417xxx  (candesartan) (1 or
10 mg/kg) or  xxxd1694xxx  (1 or 10 mg/kg) in a volume of 2 ml/kg by
gastric gavage once per day for 1 or 4 weeks after mi (candesartan,
1 mg/kg: 1 week, n510; 4 weeks, n59; candesartan, 10 mg/kg: 1
week, n511; 4 weeks, n510;  xxxd1694xxx , 1 mg/kg: 1 week, n510; 4
weeks, n510;  xxxd1694xxx , 10 mg/kg: 1 week, n59; 4 weeks, n510).
untreated rats were administered vehicle (5% gum arabic solution)
in the same manner (1 week, n59; 4 weeks, n58).

doppler echocardiographic and
hemodynamic studies
transthoracic doppler echocardiography was performed on each rat
by modifying the method described by litwin et al.18 end-diastolic
area was defined as the largest left ventricular area and end-systolic
as the smallest; calculations of ventricular chamber size were
previously published by scherrer-crosbie et al.22 ejection fraction
was measured by modifying simpson’s method, which uses 2- and
4-chamber views (figure 1).23 the hemodynamic studies are described in detail elsewhere.24 myocardial infarct size was measured
as previously described.21 rats with an infarct size of ,20% were
excluded from analysis. after determination of infarct size, the left
ventricle was divided into 3 parts, the infarcted region, myocardium
around the infarcted zone in the free left ventricle (adjacent noninfarcted myocardium), and septal myocardium (remote noninfarcted
myocardium). the infarct induced by ligation of the descending
coronary artery in the rat occurred in the free wall of the left
ventricle.

northern blot hybridization
the method of northern blot hybridization used is described in detail
elsewhere.25

statistics
results are mean6se. statistical significance was determined using
anova and duncan’s multiple range test. differences were considered significant at p,0.05.

results
effects of candesartan and  xxxd1694xxx  on
hemodynamics and heart weight
as shown in table 1, both candesartan and  xxxd1694xxx  significantly lowered mean blood pressure and left ventricular
systolic pressure (lvsp) in rats with mi. the 10-mg/kg per
day doses of candesartan and  xxxd1694xxx  decreased mean blood
pressure and lvsp more than the 1-mg/kg per day doses.
however, there was no significant difference in hypotensive
effects among the 4 groups. left ventricular end-diastolic
pressure (lvedp) and central venous pressure (cvp) were
significantly higher in rats with mi at 1 and 4 weeks than in
controls. in treated rats, lvedp and cvp decreased to a

and systole. four-chamber (top) and 2-chamber (bottom) views
are shown.

similar extent. right ventricular weight (0.7860.03 g/kg,
p,0.01) was significantly higher in rats with mi than in
controls (0.5660.03 g/kg) at 4 weeks. left ventricular weight
was lower in rats with mi than in controls at 1 week and was
the same in both controls and rats with mi at 4 weeks, which
means that scar formation in the infarcted region decreased
left ventricular weight at 1 week and canceled the weight
increased by cardiac hypertrophy of the noninfarcted regions
at 4 weeks (1 week: control, 2.1260.05 g/kg; mi, 1.9960.04
g/kg; p,0.05; 4 weeks: control, 2.1460.05 g/kg; mi,
2.1560.07 g/kg; ns). candesartan and  xxxd1694xxx  significantly prevented an increase in heart weight at 4 weeks. there
was no significant difference in heart weights among the 4
treated groups.

doppler echocardiographic assessment of left
ventricular geometry and function
left ventricular cavity size significantly increased in rats with
mi at 1 and 4 weeks (1 week: control, 6.060.6 mm; mi,
8.260.4 mm; p,0.01; 4 weeks: control, 6.760.3 mm; mi,
10.360.7 mm; p,0.01) (see table 2). rats with mi had
significant systolic dysfunction, as evidenced by decreased
fractional shortening (control, 3864%; mi, 2062%;
p,0.05) at 1 week. left ventricular posterior wall thickness
was not changed at 1 week and had decreased at 4 weeks.

e-wave velocity, rapid deceleration of the e wave, and
decreased peak a-wave velocity compared with controls. candesartan and  xxxd1694xxx  visually changed a relatively normal

candesartan and  xxxd1694xxx  significantly prevented left ventricular cavity dilatation and decreases in ejection fraction
and fractional shortening at 4 weeks (figure 2a). there was
no significant difference in improvement of systolic function
among the 4 treated groups.
examples of pulsed-wave doppler recordings of mitral
inflow from control rats and from untreated, candesartantreated (1 mg/kg per day), and  xxxd1694xxx -treated (1 mg/kg per

week, peak early diastolic filling (e-wave) velocity increased
(control, 5664 cm/s; mi, 110610 cm/s; p,0.01) and deceleration of the e wave became more rapid (control, 16.062.3
m/s2; mi, 26.362.6 m/s2; p,0.01). atrial filling (a-wave)
velocity decreased (control, 3364 cm/s; mi, 1362 cm/s;
p,0.01), resulting in a marked increase in the ratio of
e-wave to a-wave velocity (e/a) (control, 1.960.2; mi,
9.260.6; p,0.01). candesartan and  xxxd1694xxx  significantly
prevented worsening of diastolic dysfunction, as evidenced

the results of cardiac gene expression at 1 and 4 weeks are
shown in figure 3 and tables 3 and 4. at 1 week after mi,
b-myosin heavy chain (b-mhc), a-skeletal actin, atrial
natriuretic peptide (anp), and collagen i and iii mrna
expression increased 4.5-, 3.1-, 9.4-, 14.3-, and 8.4-fold
(p,0.01), respectively, in the adjacent noninfarcted myocardium. gene expression increased significantly in the remote
noninfarcted left ventricle (septum) and right ventricle. these
genes were predominantly expressed in the adjacent noninfarcted myocardium rather than the remote noninfarcted left
ventricle and right ventricle. at 1 week, candesartan and
 xxxd1694xxx  significantly prevented mrna expression of
b-mhc, a-skeletal actin, and anp in the adjacent and
remote noninfarcted left ventricles and right ventricle but did
not affect mrna expression of collagens i and iii in any
region. at 4 weeks, b-mhc, a-skeletal actin, anp, and
collagen i and iii mrna expression remained increased.
both candesartan and  xxxd1694xxx  prevented these increases
significantly in all regions. there was no significant difference in prevention of cardiac gene expression among the 4
treated groups.

untreated, candesartan-treated (10 mg/kg per day), and

prevented enlargement of a typical remodeled heart at 12
weeks after mi.

discussion
as expected, our study showed that treatment with candesartan or  xxxd1694xxx  attenuates left ventricular dilatation and
cardiac hypertrophy in the noninfarcted region and improves
ejection fraction (measured by the modified simpson’s method), fractional shortening, and left ventricular wall thickening
at 4 weeks after mi. a variety of ways to calculate volumes
have been proposed. measuring ejection fraction with the

modified simpson’s method is the most reliable way to assess
systolic function using echocardiographic parameters because
it minimizes the effect of geometric shape for calculating
volumes. left ventricular weight in the untreated infarct
group was the same as in the control group at 4 weeks despite
the presence of infarcts and considerable loss of myocardium
(which was replaced by a thin wall of scar tissue), which
suggests that reactive hypertrophy of the noninfarcted left
ventricle occurred. consequently, the reduced left ventricular
weights of the candesartan- and  xxxd1694xxx -treated groups
indicate that reactive hypertrophy was prevented. relatively
little improvement of systolic function was induced by
candesartan or  xxxd1694xxx , but this increase coincided with a
decrease in lvedp, suggesting that the pumping ability of
the left ventricle was significantly improved.
doppler echocardiography is currently the primary technique for evaluating left ventricular diastolic function.17
increased e-wave velocity, decreased peak a-wave velocity
(or absent a wave), and rapid e-wave deceleration were
observed in our rats, and these flow patterns were similar to
transmitral flow profiles observed in patients with heart
failure with restrictive patterns. both candesartan and  xxxd1694xxx  decreased the e/a ratio and e-wave deceleration rate at 1

and 4 weeks. long-term ace inhibitor therapy could prevent
changes in left ventricular diastolic properties in patients with
depressed ejection fraction.26 we recently reported that candesartan improved the diastolic filling pattern in rats with
mi.27 our data showed that candesartan and  xxxd1694xxx  prevented abnormal diastolic filling before systolic dysfunction
after mi. this effect of ace inhibitors has been already
reported.28 improvement of diastolic filling is caused by
preload, afterload reduction, improvement in left ventricular
relaxation, or decrease in passive elastic properties. our data
do not directly answer the difficult question of whether the
changes in left ventricle filling are due to changes in
myocardial properties, changes in left ventricle loading conditions, or both. however, when viewed in the context of
previous studies using isolated muscle preparations from the
same model of heart failure,29,30 the improvements in diastolic filling that accompany inhibition of the renin-angiotensin
system result from a combination of effects on left ventricular
preload and afterload as well as left ventricular chamber
properties.
during the early phase of mi, the heart attempts to provide
hemodynamic compensation at the expense of ventricular
dilatation (frank-starling law).31 chronic, continued hemo-

dynamic stress leads to pathological hypertrophy and progressive dilatation. we have noted that mi occurs in the free
wall in rats; therefore, the marginal zone of the infarcted
region (myocardium adjacent to infarct region) is located in
the left ventricular free wall. thus, we must examine the left
ventricular free wall and septum to analyze the properties of
the whole noninfarcted left ventricle. left ventricular remodeling after mi is known to be accompanied by severe

candesartan-treated (10 mg/kg per day) and  xxxd1694xxx -treated
(10 mg/kg per day) rats at 12 weeks after mi. candesartan and
 xxxd1694xxx  apparently prevented enlargement of the remodeled
heart. mi indicates rats with mi that were untreated; at1, rats
treated with candesartan; and acei, rats treated with  xxxd1694xxx .

hypertrophy of the myocyte and dysfunction of regions
adjacent to the infarct. we previously reported that fetal
genes (b-mhc, a-skeletal actin, and anp) are predominantly expressed in adjacent noninfarcted myocardium. however, the pattern of fetal gene expression did not differ
between adjacent and remote noninfarcted myocardium.24 in
the present study, candesartan and  xxxd1694xxx  equally prevented fetal gene expression at 1 and 4 weeks and collagen
gene expression at 4 weeks, indicating that both the at1
receptor antagonist and the ace inhibitor attenuate remodeling of the myocyte and nonmyocyte compartments to a
similar extent after mi. although candesartan and  xxxd1694xxx 
inhibited increased mrna expression of collagens i and iii at
4 weeks, neither drug did so at 1 week.  xxxg100xxx 
antagonists and ace inhibitors are reported to suppress
interstitial fibrosis in noninfarcted myocardium.11 we believe
the reason is that the half-life of collagen is 80 to 120 days,32
which would make it difficult to detect a change in gene
expression after 1 week of treatment.
mcdonald et al9 reported that ace inhibitors, but not at1
receptor antagonists, attenuate left ventricular remodeling in
dogs after transmyocardial direct shock. moreover, they
showed a possible role of the bradykinin b2-receptor antag-

yoshiyama et al
onist hoe 140 in the antiremodeling effect of ace inhibitors
in this model.33 because ace inhibitors block degradation of
bradykinin and because candesartan and  xxxd1694xxx  have the
same cardioprotective effect, we may interpret these data to
indicate that the cardioprotective effect of ace inhibitors is
due to blockade of the conversion of  xxxg99xxx  to
 xxxg99xxx , not inhibition of kinin hydrolysis. however,
the effect of the  xxxg100xxx  antagonist may not be entirely
due to blockade of the  xxxg100xxx . angiotensin receptors
comprise 2 major subtypes, at1 and  xxxg101xxx .34 when the at1
receptor is blocked, plasma renin and angiotensin increase;
angiotensin may act on  xxxg101xxx  receptors, which could have an
antitrophic effect either directly or via the release of autocoids, such as kinins35,36 and  xxxd2738xxx ,37,38 and consequently may contribute to the therapeutic effect of at1
receptor antagonist by a mechanism similar to that of kinins.
liu et al8 reported that the effect of the ace inhibitor is
mediated in part by kinins, whereas that of the  xxxg100xxx 
antagonist is triggered by activation of the  xxxg101xxx  receptor and
is also mediated in part by kinins. nunez et al39 showed that
combination of an ace inhibitor and  xxxg100xxx  antagonist
improved hemodynamics in association with reduced left
ventricular mass in spontaneously hypertensive rats. however, additional studies are needed to verify that the release of
autocoids by  xxxg100xxx  antagonists has the same beneficial
effects on systolic and diastolic function as those induced by
inhibition of bradykinin degradation by an ace inhibitor.
in summary, candesartan and  xxxd1694xxx  had equally beneficial effects on cardiac function, as assessed by doppler
echocardiography and cardiac gene expression, after mi.
