[new immunological weapons for medicine in the 21st century: biological therapy based on the use of the latest generation monoclonal antibodies].  the fusion of a murine b cell and a myeloma cell generates a hybridoma that produces monoclonal antibody (mab). these murine mab induce the hama (human anti-mouse antibodies) response. murine mab have been modified by genetic engineering, producing molecules with a higher proportion of human protein. at present, chimeric, humanized and fully human mab are available. mab block interactions between target molecules and their ligands or trigger the lyses of mab-coated tumor cells. numerous mab have been developed using the recombinant dna technology and several are available in the market. trastuzumab, against her2/neu, is useful in breast cancer; rituximab, against cd20 in b lymphocytes is useful in lymphoma; alemtuzumah, against  xxxg393xxx  is used in lymphoma and leukemia;  xxxd1798xxx  and  xxxd286xxx  block the  xxxg1175xxx  interaction and reduce acute rejection in kidney transplantation;  xxxd53xxx , an antagonist of  xxxg1202xxx /iiia platelet receptor, is used in patients undergoing acute coronary syndromes. in autoimmunity diseases, blocking  xxxg2296xxx  by infliximab and adalimumab has demonstrated excellent results. thus, infliximab is useful in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (ra), crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis while adalimumab is the first fully human mab available for ra. infliximab and adalimumab reduce signs and symptoms in ra and they also interfere with progression of joint damage. finally, the direct benefits of antagonist treatment can occur at the expense of a major adverse effect in some other biological function.
