physiological and pathological processes (reviewed in refs. 1
and 2). the distinct biological responses of cells to fgfs thus
far appear to be mediated by a family of transmembrane fgf
receptors (fgfrs). these include  xxxg791xxx /flg (3–5),  xxxg792xxx /bek
(4, 6, 7),  xxxg793xxx  (8), and  xxxg794xxx  (9). the four receptors constitute a subclass of receptor tyrosine kinases that is characterized by three (or two) extracellular immunoglobulin-like domains (ig domains), a membrane spanning region, and a
cytoplasmic portion that contains a  xxxg2198xxx  domain
(10). fgfrs 1–3, but not  xxxg794xxx , are subject to a high degree
of alternative splicing of their primary transcripts that results
in a multitude of combinatorial splice variants (reviewed in
ref. 11). alternative splicing within the  xxxg2198xxx  domain
of  xxxg791xxx  can result in a kinase-defective molecule. upon ligand binding this kinase-defective variant oligomerizes with a
kinase-containing fgfr resulting in a heterodimer complex
incapable of phosphorylation and activation of phospholipase
cg (12). however, the majority of alternative splicing events
occur in the extracellular portion of the receptor. for example,
cdnas for  xxxg791xxx  and  xxxg792xxx  which lack sequences corresponding to the first ig domain have been isolated (5, 13–18).
analysis of the genomic structures of  xxxg791xxx  and  xxxg792xxx  has
revealed that this domain is encoded by a single exon that is
spliced out in the two ig domain forms of the receptor (19). the
absence of this ig domain does not appear to affect ligand
binding to  xxxg791xxx  (13) or  xxxg792xxx  (18, 20).
other splice variants in  xxxg791xxx  and  xxxg792xxx  arise in ig
domain iii (13, 19). the cooh-terminal half of this domain in
 xxxg791xxx  is encoded by three alternative exons (iiia, iiib, and
iiic) that can result in the expression of a secreted receptor and
two different transmembrane receptors, respectively. exons
iiib and iiic have homologs in the  xxxg792xxx  gene (19). their
mutually exclusive splicing in the second half of ig domain iii
results in the bek (iiic) isoform (4, 6, 21) or the kgf receptor
( xxxg792xxx ) (iiib) isoform (15, 17, 18, 22). the bek receptor has
been shown to bind with high affinity to  xxxg786xxx ,  xxxg787xxx ,  xxxg789xxx ,
and fgf-5 but not to  xxxd2829xxx  (4, 6, 23, 24). in contrast,  xxxg792xxx 
binds  xxxd2829xxx  as well as  xxxg786xxx  but the binding to  xxxg787xxx  is
significantly decreased (18, 25). recently, the genomic organization of ig domain iii of  xxxg793xxx  has revealed the existence of
homologous iiia, iiib, and iiic exons (26). the original  xxxg793xxx 
cdna containing the iiic exon is preferentially activated by
 xxxg786xxx  and  xxxg789xxx , to a lesser extent by  xxxg787xxx , and has almost
no response to fgf-5 (27). the iiib splice variant of  xxxg793xxx ,
however, shows the most restricted ligand binding properties of
any fgfr described so far, binding exclusively  xxxg786xxx  (26). the
genomic organization of  xxxg794xxx  shows the presence of a single
exon encoding the cooh-terminal half of the ig domain iii
region (28).
a role for fgfs in development is suggested by the unique
expression patterns of several family members (29 –32). likewise, the fgfrs have recently been shown to have unique

we have previously cloned and sequenced a newt  xxxg792xxx  ( xxxg792xxx ) cdna which
exhibited a unique spatial and temporal expression pattern in the regenerating newt limb. in this report, we
further characterize the biochemical and functional
properties of this newt  xxxg792xxx . a stable chinese hamster
ovary transfectant overexpressing the newt  xxxg792xxx  was
capable of binding both 125i-fibroblast growth factor-1
( xxxg786xxx ) and 125i- xxxd2829xxx  but not 125i- xxxg787xxx , indistinguishable from the human  xxxg792xxx . scatchard analysis and
cross-linking studies further support the conclusion
that  xxxg786xxx  and  xxxd2829xxx  are the ligands for the newt
 xxxg792xxx . in addition to their ability to bind to fgfs, both
the human and the newt  xxxg792xxx  are also capable of repressing differentiation in mouse mm14 myoblasts.
mm14 cells express  xxxg791xxx  and are repressed from differentiation by  xxxg786xxx ,  xxxg787xxx , and  xxxg789xxx  but not  xxxd2829xxx .
co-transfection of mm14 cells with either a human or
newt  xxxg792xxx  expression construct conferred a response
to  xxxd2829xxx  as determined by a human a-cardiac actin/
luciferase reporter construct. the response to  xxxd2829xxx 
was similar to the endogenous fgf response as  xxxd2829xxx 
prevented mm14 myoblasts from undergoing terminal
differentiation. thus, both the human and the newt
kgfrs transduce signals similar to those transduced
via the endogenous mouse  xxxg791xxx . together these data
indicate that this newly isolated newt  xxxg792xxx  is a functional receptor as it binds two fgf family members with
high affinity and mediates signaling in skeletal muscle
myoblasts. because the binding pattern of the newt
 xxxg792xxx  is similar to the pattern observed for its mammalian counterpart, it emphasizes the strict conservation
that this ligand/receptor system has undergone through
evolution.

functional characterization of newt  xxxg792xxx 

materials and methods

plasmid cdna construction—the isolation of overlapping, partial
cdnas encoding newt homologs of two  xxxg792xxx  splice variants bek and
 xxxg792xxx  have been described elsewhere (22). these overlapping cdnas
were used to construct the full-length newt  xxxg792xxx  cdna in pbluescript
ks(1) (stratagene) by conventional dna cloning techniques (41). the
entire nucleotide and amino acid sequences of the newt  xxxg792xxx  have
been determined (42). the full-length receptor cdna construct was
excised from pbluescript with xhoi and noti and directionally cloned
into the xhoi-noti sites of the mammalian expression vector pbj5 (43)
to make the newt  xxxg792xxx  expression plasmid pnkgfr. expression of
cdnas cloned into this vector are driven by the strong sra hybrid
promoter (44). phkgfr is a human  xxxg792xxx  expression plasmid that
contains a three ig domain form of the human  xxxg792xxx  cdna (18) cloned
into pbj5.
the ecori site of a 245-base pair ecori/hindiii fragment of
phca177cat (45) containing the region of the human a-cardiac actin
gene from 2177 base pairs to 168 base pairs was filled in and the insert
cloned into the smai/hindiii site at the 59 end of the luciferase gene in
the pgl2 basic vector. the resultant plasmid is designated a-cardiac
actin/luciferase reporter.
cell lines and transfections—cho-k1 cells (atcc, rockville, md)
were maintained in ham’s f-12 nutrient mixture supplemented with
10% fetal bovine serum and penicillin/streptomycin. cho cells were
cotransfected with 10 mg of pbj5 or pnkgfr and 1 mg of psv2neo
using the modified calcium-phosphate precipitation method (46). transfected cells were placed under  xxxg418xxx  (life technologies, inc.) selection
(400 mg/ml) and colonies isolated 2 weeks later. stable transfectants
were maintained in media supplemented with  xxxg418xxx  (400 mg/ml) and
tested for the expression of newt  xxxg792xxx  by binding analysis. a pbj5
transfectant (cho/control) and a newt  xxxg792xxx  expressing cell line
(cho/nkgfr) were selected for further study.
nih/3t3 cells were maintained in dulbecco’s modified eagle’s medium supplemented with 10% calf serum and penicillin/streptomycin. a
transformed nih/3t3 cell line, nih/hkgfr (18), which overexpresses
the human  xxxg792xxx  was maintained in the same media with the addition
of  xxxg418xxx  (750 mg/ml). mouse mm14 cells (47) were cultured on gelatincoated plates in growth medium consisting of ham’s f-10 supplemented
with 0.8 mm cacl2, 100 units/ml penicillin, 5 mg/ml streptomycin, and
15% horse serum. the concentration of  xxxg787xxx  was increased from 5 to
40 ng/ml with increasing cell density.
growth factors—bovine brain  xxxg786xxx  (r & d systems, minneapolis
mn), human recombinant  xxxg787xxx  (48), and human recombinant  xxxd2829xxx 
(promega, madison, wi) were iodinated using the chloramine-t
method. briefly, 2 mg of fgf were incubated together with 10 ml of 1 m
sodium phosphate buffer, ph 7.4, 1 mci of na125i (amersham), and 30
ml of 100 mg/ml chloramine t in a final volume of 70 ml for 90 s at room
temperature. the reaction was stopped by the addition of 100 ml of 20
mm dithiothreitol and further incubated at room temperature for 10
min. the iodination reaction was placed over a heparin-agarose column

and washed with wash buffer (20 mm hepes, 0.2% bovine serum
albumin, 0.4 m nacl) to remove unincorporated 125i and biologically
inactive 125i-fgf. bound 125i-fgf was eluted off the column with
elution buffer (20 mm hepes, 0.2% bovine  xxxg124xxx , nacl; the
nacl concentration varied depending on the 125i-fgf that was being
eluted off the column: for  xxxg786xxx , 2.0 m;  xxxd2829xxx , 1.0 m;  xxxg787xxx , 3.0 m). the
biological activity of the labeled fgfs was ascertained by dna synthesis assays on responsive cell lines. specific activities ranged from 1 to 5
3 105 cpm/ng for 125i- xxxg786xxx  and 125i- xxxg787xxx  and 4 to 8 3 104 cpm/ng for
125
i- xxxd2829xxx . murine egf (promega) was used as a nonspecific competitor in the competition assays.
the  xxxg786xxx  protein used in the skeletal muscle reporter gene activity
assay was obtained from bovine brain as described elsewhere (48).
qualitative binding assays, competition assays, and scatchard
analysis—nih/3t3, nih/hkgfr, cho/nkgfr, and cho/control
were seeded at a density of 7 3 104 cells/well in a 24-well plate.
twenty-four hours later the cells were washed twice with cold (4 °c)
phosphate-buffered saline (pbs) and incubated with 125i-fgf in 0.2 ml
of binding buffer (ham’s f-12 with 25 mm hepes, ph 7.3, 0.15%
gelatin, and 10 mg/ml heparin) for 2 h at 4 °c. cells were then washed
twice with pbs and once with either pbs, 1.0 m nacl (125i- xxxg786xxx );
pbs, 0.5 m nacl (125i- xxxd2829xxx ); or pbs, 2.0 m nacl (125i- xxxg787xxx ). cells
were then solubilized in 0.5 ml of 0.3 n naoh and bound radioactivity
counted on a beckman g-counter. the addition of a brief salt wash along
with the presence of heparin in the binding buffer minimized low
affinity binding of the tracers.
for the qualitative binding assays, protein assays were then performed on the solubilized cells as described by the manufacturer (biorad). incubation of the cells with the labeled fgfs was carried out in
the absence (total binding) or presence (nonspecific binding) of 100-fold
molar excess of unlabeled fgf. mean cpm bound per mg of total cell
protein (6s.d.) was determined from triplicate samples. specific binding is defined as total binding minus nonspecific binding. in the competition assays 125i- xxxg786xxx  (2.3 ng/ml) or 125i- xxxd2829xxx  (3.4 ng/ml) was
added to the wells in the presence of increasing amounts of unlabeled
competitor. duplicate wells were used for each concentration of unlabeled competitor. for the scatchard analysis increasing amounts of
125
i-fgf were added to duplicate wells with nonspecific binding counts
obtained in parallel assays using 100-fold excess of unlabeled fgf.
cross-linking analysis—cho/control and cho/nkgfr were
seeded in 60-mm dishes at a density of 5 3 105 cells/dish. twenty-four
hours later cells were washed once with cold pbs and incubated with 1
3 106 cpm of labeled fgfs (in the absence or presence of 100-fold molar
excess of unlabeled fgfs) in 5.0 ml of binding buffer for 1 h at 4 °c.
cells were washed three times with cold pbs and labeled fgf was
cross-linked to cell surface receptors by incubation with 5.0 ml of 0.3 mm
disuccinimidyl suberate (diluted in pbs from a 30 mm stock in dimethyl
sulfoxide) for 30 min at 4 °c. cells were then washed twice with cold
pbs, scraped in 1.5 ml of pbs, and centrifuged for 2 min at 14,000 3 g.
the cell pellet was resuspended in 45 ml of lysis buffer (20 mm hepes,
ph 7.4, 150 mm nacl, 1% triton x-100, 10% glycerol, 1.5 mm mgcl2, 1
mm edta, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mg/ml aprotinin, and
1 mg/ml leupeptin) and incubated on ice for 30 min. solubilized cells
were centrifuged for 5 min at 14,000 3 g and 40 ml of the clarified cell
lysate transferred to 40 ml of 2 3 sds sample buffer. samples were
boiled for 5 min and subjected to 7.5% sds-page after which the gel
was dried and exposed to an x-ray film.
skeletal muscle reporter gene assay—mm14 cells were seeded at a
density of 5 3 104 cells per 100-mm dishes 6 – 8 h before transfection. a
calcium phosphate-dna precipitate containing 1 mg of a-cardiac actin/
luciferase reporter construct (a gift from dr. stephen konieczny, purdue university) and 0.5 mg of cmv-lacz (centre commercil de gros
(toulouse, france)) with 15 mg of pbj5, pnkgfr, or phkgfr was
prepared in 0.55 ml of hbs (25 mm hepes, ph 7.05, 140 mm nacl, 5
mm kcl, 0.75 mm na2hpo4, 6 mm dextrose) containing 0.11 m cacl2.
the cells were incubated with 0.5 ml of the precipitate for 20 min before
addition of growth medium containing  xxxg787xxx . after 4 h, the cells were
osmotically shocked for 2.5 min with 15% glycerol in hbs. growth
medium containing 1 mm insulin and 20 ng/ml  xxxg786xxx ,  xxxg787xxx , or  xxxd2829xxx 
were added as indicated. additional  xxxg786xxx ,  xxxg787xxx , or  xxxd2829xxx  was added
every 12 h. the cells were harvested for assay of luciferase and b-galactosidase activities 36 h following the osmotic shock. luciferase activity was measured using the luciferase assay system (promega)
following the manufacturer’s instructions except for the addition of 2
mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 1 mg/ml leupeptin to the cell
solubilization buffer. b-galactosidase activity was determined in aliquots of the same lysates using the galacto-lighty chemiluminescent
reporter assay system (tropix). luciferase and b-galactosidase activ-

temporal and spatial expression patterns as well (33–35). in
addition, the targeted expression of a dominant negative
 xxxg791xxx  in the epidermis (36) and  xxxg792xxx  in the lung (37) in
transgenic mice results in disruptions in the normal developmental architecture of those tissues. fgfs and their receptors
have been implicated in amphibian limb regeneration, a process which closely parallels normal limb development. infusion
of fgf into the distal stump of denervated newt limbs stimulates cell cycling over the depressed level normally observed
after denervation (38). recently,  xxxg786xxx  (39) and two fgfrs,
namely  xxxg791xxx  and  xxxg792xxx  (22), have been shown to be present
in the regenerating limb blastemas of newts, with the latter
displaying unique temporal and spatial expression patterns
throughout the regeneration process. we further showed that
 xxxg792xxx  is the  xxxg792xxx  variant that is expressed in the basal layer
of the wound epithelium (40). the present study was undertaken to explore the functionality of the newt homolog of  xxxg792xxx 
and its potential relevance in amphibian limb regeneration.
here we present data showing that the newt  xxxg792xxx  possesses
the ability to bind specific members of the fgf family in a
manner indistinguishable from its human counterpart. moreover, the expression of this receptor in mouse mm14 myoblast
cells represses terminal differentiation mediated by  xxxd2829xxx .

acid residues to another in-frame methionine that was included in the
cdnas. the thicker line representing the carboxyl-terminal half of the
proximal ig-like domain highlights the area where two mutually exclusive exons (iiib and iiic) are spliced into the final transcript. the iiib
exon in newt  xxxg792xxx  is stippled, whereas the iiic exon in newt bek is
hatched. the small table shows the fgf specificity that these two exons
impart onto the respective human  xxxg792xxx  receptors. b, graph showing

ities were quantitated in a berthold lumat luminometer. reporter gene
activity was calculated by dividing the values obtained for a-cardiac
actin/luciferase activity by the cmv/b-galactosidase activity determined in each extract. the activity of the cmv promoter determined by
the b-galactosidase assay in proliferating and differentiated mm14
cells varies less than 2-fold.2
results

newt  xxxg792xxx  cdna construction—we have previously reported the isolation from the newt, notophthalamus viridescens, of overlapping cdnas which encode the amphibian homologs of two  xxxg792xxx  splice variants, bek and  xxxg792xxx  (22). to
address the question of whether the potential receptors are
functional molecules, the overlapping cdnas were used to construct the full-length receptors shown in fig. 1a. the fulllength newt  xxxg792xxx  cdna was originally constructed in pbluescript and was subsequently cloned into the mammalian

expression vector pbj5. cotransfection of cho-k1 cells with
psv2neo and either the pbj5 expression vector or the newt
 xxxg792xxx  expression construct, pnkgfr, resulted in the isolation
of stable  xxxg418xxx -resistant transfectants cho/control and cho/
nkgfr, respectively.
binding properties of the newt  xxxg792xxx —to evaluate the ability of the newt  xxxg792xxx  to bind to  xxxg786xxx  and  xxxd2829xxx , a series of
binding assays were performed on the cho/control and cho/
nkgfr cell lines using 125i-fgfs as tracers. as a comparison,
a cell line overexpressing the human  xxxg792xxx , nih/hkgfr, and
its parental nih/3t3 cell line were used in these assays. the
nih/hkgfr cell line has been previously shown to bind to
 xxxd2829xxx  with high affinity (18).
in a qualitative binding assay the human  xxxg792xxx  showed a
significant increase in binding to 125i- xxxg786xxx  and 125i- xxxd2829xxx 
relative to nih/3t3 cells but was not capable of binding 125ifgf-2 over that which was observed in the parental cell line
(data not shown). these results confirmed the previously published results of this human  xxxg792xxx  splice variant (18). likewise, the newt  xxxg792xxx  expressing cell line, cho/nkgfr, shows
an increase in binding to 125i- xxxg786xxx  and 125i- xxxd2829xxx  but not
125
i- xxxg787xxx  when compared to the expression vector transfected
cell line, cho/control (fig. 1b). thus, the newt  xxxg792xxx  exhibits
an fgf binding profile that is similar to its human
counterpart.
to determine the size of the newt  xxxg792xxx  expressed in the
cho/nkgfr cell line, a cross-linking analysis was performed.
the predicted size of the newt  xxxg792xxx  based on the primary
amino acid sequence of the cdna is 82 kda. when either
125
i- xxxg786xxx  or 125i- xxxd2829xxx  was cross-linked to the newt  xxxg792xxx 
and analyzed by 7.5% sds-page, a predominant cross-linked
product with an apparent molecular mass of 165–170 kda was
detected (lanes 2, fig. 2, a and b, respectively). subtraction of
the molecular mass of the ligands yields an estimated molecular mass of 150 kda for the expressed receptor. the difference
between the apparent and predicted molecular weights for
newt  xxxg792xxx  is most likely due to an extensive degree of nlinked glycosylation in the extracellular domain. a cross-linked
product is not observed in the cho/control cell line with either

excess of unlabeled competitor:  xxxd2829xxx  (lane 3),  xxxg786xxx  (lane 4), and
 xxxg787xxx  (lane 5). the cells were incubated with the fgfs for 1 h at 4 °c
after which they were cross-linked to cell surface receptors with dss
(0.3 mm). the cross-linked products were then analyzed by 7.5% sdspage. the molecular masses of the protein standards (lane m) are in

nih/hkgfr (a) and newt  xxxg792xxx  expressing cell line cho/nkgfr (b)
were incubated with a constant amount of 125i- xxxg786xxx  (2.3 ng/ml) in the
presence of increasing concentrations of unlabeled competitors:  xxxg786xxx 
(open squares),  xxxd2829xxx  (open diamonds),  xxxg787xxx  (open circles), and egf
(open triangles). after washing the cells to remove unbound ligands and
solubilizing in 0.3 n naoh, the samples were counted on a beckman
g-counter. each concentration of competitor was carried out in duplicate and the average plotted as a percentage of bound 125i- xxxg786xxx  in the
presence of the lowest concentration of competitor. the standard error
of the mean for all samples never exceeded 11% of the average.

fore, mm14 cells transfected with an a-cardiac actin/luciferase
reporter construct should exhibit an increase in luciferase activity if allowed to differentiate. however, if they are cultured
in the presence of the appropriate fgf little increase in luciferase activity will be seen indicating that differentiation is
repressed.
mm14 cells transfected with the pbj5 expression vector
along with the a-cardiac actin/luciferase reporter construct
exhibit a large increase in luciferase activity, both in the absence and presence of  xxxd2829xxx  (fig. 6). these results verify that
these cells do not express endogenous receptors for  xxxd2829xxx  and
are not capable of responding to this growth factor. as expected, when cultured in the presence of either  xxxg786xxx  or
 xxxg787xxx , the pbj5 transfected cells are repressed from differentiation as indicated by a low level of luciferase activity. the
ability of both  xxxg786xxx  and  xxxg787xxx  to repress differentiation in

of the labeled fgfs (lanes 1, fig. 2, a and b). cross-linkings
carried out in the presence of 100-fold excess of unlabeled fgfs
indicate that the receptor is specific for  xxxg786xxx  and  xxxd2829xxx  as
both of these ligands are capable of competing with either
125
i- xxxg786xxx  or 125i- xxxd2829xxx  for the receptor (lanes 3 and 4 of fig.
2, a and b). interestingly,  xxxg786xxx  appears to be a more effective
competitor than  xxxd2829xxx  for 125i- xxxd2829xxx  which may reflect a
higher affinity of the receptor for  xxxg786xxx . unlabeled  xxxg787xxx  is a
much less effective competitor for both 125i- xxxg786xxx  and 125ifgf-7 binding to the newt  xxxg792xxx  (lane 5, fig. 2, a and b).
to address the specificity of the newt  xxxg792xxx  in a quantitative
manner, a competition assay was performed on cho/nkgfr
cells using 125i- xxxg786xxx  and 125i- xxxd2829xxx  as radiolabeled tracers
in the presence of increasing concentrations of unlabeled
 xxxg786xxx ,  xxxg787xxx ,  xxxd2829xxx , or egf. high affinity 125i- xxxg786xxx  binding to cho/nkgfr cells was effectively competed by  xxxg786xxx 
and  xxxd2829xxx  with similar efficiencies (50% displacement at 35
ng/ml for  xxxg786xxx  and 60 ng/ml for  xxxd2829xxx ). however, neither
 xxxg787xxx  nor egf was able to compete for 125i- xxxg786xxx  binding to
newt  xxxg792xxx  on these cells (fig. 3b). in a similar manner, high
affinity binding of 125i- xxxg786xxx  to nih/hkgfr cells was also
competed by  xxxg786xxx  and  xxxd2829xxx  (fig. 3a). although egf again
showed no specific competition toward human  xxxg792xxx ,  xxxg787xxx 
was capable of competing with 125i- xxxg786xxx  at higher concentrations. when 125i- xxxd2829xxx  is used as the tracer a dramatic difference in the pattern of competition can be seen with  xxxg786xxx  and
 xxxd2829xxx  in that  xxxg786xxx  appears to be a more effective competitor
than  xxxd2829xxx  for binding of 125i- xxxd2829xxx  to both human  xxxg792xxx 
(fig. 4a) and newt  xxxg792xxx  (fig. 4b). this data is consistent with
the observations from the cross-linking analysis. the concentrations of unlabeled  xxxg786xxx  and  xxxd2829xxx  needed to achieve 50%
displacement of the two labeled tracers were consistently 3– 4fold higher for the newt  xxxg792xxx .
the results of the competition assay suggest that the newt
 xxxg792xxx  has a slightly lower affinity toward  xxxg786xxx  and  xxxd2829xxx 
relative to its human counterpart. to more precisely determine
the affinity of  xxxg786xxx  and  xxxd2829xxx  to the newt  xxxg792xxx  a scatchard
analysis was performed on the cho/nkgfr cell line. fig. 5, a
and b, reveal that the newt  xxxg792xxx  binds to  xxxg786xxx  with a kd of
660 pm and to  xxxd2829xxx  with a kd of 860 pm. the affinity of the
newt  xxxg792xxx  for  xxxd2829xxx  is approximately 4-fold lower than the
reported affinity of the human  xxxg792xxx  for this ligand (18).
ability of newt  xxxg792xxx  to repress differentiation in mm14
mouse myoblasts—the above data indicate that the newt
 xxxg792xxx  binds fgf family members with high affinity in a manner similar to the human  xxxg792xxx . to address whether this
binding results in activation of the receptor and subsequent
intracellular signaling, we tested the human and newt  xxxg792xxx 
for their ability to repress differentiation in the mouse mm14
myoblast cell line. this cell line is dependent on fgfs for
repression of skeletal muscle differentiation. deprivation of
fgf induces terminal differentiation that results in the exit of
the cells from the cell cycle, expression of muscle-specific genes,
and fusion into multinucleated myotubes (49). the fgfs capable of repressing differentiation in mm14 cells include  xxxg786xxx ,
 xxxg787xxx , and  xxxg789xxx ; however,  xxxd2829xxx  is not active on these cells
(50). therefore, expression of  xxxg792xxx  by mm14 cells should
allow us to assay its ability to repress differentiation in the
presence of  xxxd2829xxx . to assay for differentiation, a luciferase
reporter construct was utilized. this construct has a 245-base
pair fragment corresponding to the region of the human a-cardiac actin gene from 2177 to 168 inserted at the 59 end of the
luciferase gene in the pgl2basic luciferase vector. the region
2177 to 168 of the human a-cardiac actin gene is sufficient to
drive differentiated muscle-specific expression of chloramphenicol acetyltransferase in a mouse myoblast cell line (45). there-

discussion

this assay serves as an internal positive control for the competence of these cells to respond to exogenously added fgf. the
expression of either human or newt  xxxg792xxx  by mm14 cells
resulted in low levels of luciferase activity when cultured in the
presence of  xxxd2829xxx . the data are indicative of an acquired
ability of these transfected cells to repress differentiation mediated by  xxxd2829xxx  (fig. 6). in the absence of exogenously added
growth factor, both the human and newt  xxxg792xxx  transfected
cells showed an increase in luciferase activity. these data
suggest that the human as well as the newt  xxxg792xxx  isoform of
 xxxg792xxx  is capable of mediating a signal within mm14 myoblasts that leads to repression of differentiation. the ability of
the ectopically expressed kgfrs to function in this capacity is
similar to or better than the activity observed with the endogenous fgf receptors expressed by this cell line.

in this study, we report on the functional characterization of
a newt  xxxg792xxx  variant which was previously isolated in our
laboratory (22). the construction of full-length cdnas from the
available overlapping cdna clones resulted in receptors that
lacked the first ig domain and as a consequence the extracellular region of these receptors contain the acidic box followed
by ig domains ii and iii (fig. 1a). the receptors differ only in
the cooh-terminal half of ig domain iii where it is known
that the alternative splicing of two different exons, iiib and
iiic, takes place in a mutually exclusive fashion giving rise to
the  xxxg792xxx  and bek variants, respectively. the newt  xxxg792xxx 
possesses a unique spatial and temporal pattern of expression
in the regenerating newt limb with the strongest expression
observed predominantly in the basal layer of the wound epithelium (40). because the wound epithelium is a necessary
component of the regenerate (51) and has been shown to ex-

press a number of molecules which are not expressed in skin
epidermis (52–54), we were interested in examining the functional capacity of the newt  xxxg792xxx  splice variant. because no
amphibian fgfs are available, mammalian fgfs were utilized as radiolabeled ligands in binding and functional assays.
we were encouraged with this approach by the fact that radiolabeled bovine  xxxg786xxx  had been used successfully as a probe in
in situ studies with axolotl limb blastemas (39) and because of
the high degree of amino acid identity between human and
newt  xxxg792xxx  (22).
in qualitative binding assays using iodinated fgfs we found
that a newt  xxxg792xxx  expressing cho cell line, cho/nkgfr,
exhibited an increase in binding to  xxxg786xxx  and  xxxd2829xxx  relative
to a control cell line, cho/control (fig. 1b). however, cho/
nkgfr showed no appreciable increase in binding to  xxxg787xxx .
these results were indistinguishable from the binding of these
fgfs to a human  xxxg792xxx  expressing cell line nih/hkgfr
(data not shown). these results combined with the high degree
of amino acid sequence identity observed between the human
and newt exon iiib region (86%), strongly support our claim
that this newt  xxxg792xxx  splice variant is a functional homolog of
the human  xxxg792xxx .
cross-linking of either 125i- xxxg786xxx  or 125i- xxxd2829xxx  to receptors
on the surface of cho/nkgfr show a predominant crosslinked product with an apparent molecular mass of 150 kda.
this cross-linked product was specific since the addition of a
100-fold molar excess of unlabeled fgfs prior to cross-linking
competed the radiolabeled ligand. unlabeled  xxxg786xxx  and  xxxd2829xxx 
were able to decrease binding of the two labeled fgfs; how-

fig. 6.  xxxd2829xxx  mediated repression of skeletal muscle differentiation in mm14 cells expressing newt and human  xxxg792xxx . mm14
myoblasts were transfected with an a-cardiac actin/luciferase reporter
plasmid, a cmv-lacz plasmid, and the pbj5 expression vector, the
newt  xxxg792xxx  expression plasmid pnkgfr, or the human  xxxg792xxx  expression plasmid phkgfr as described under “materials and methods.”
the transfected cells were cultured either in the absence of any exogenously added growth factor (filled bars) or in the presence of  xxxg786xxx 
(open bars),  xxxg787xxx  (stippled bars), or  xxxd2829xxx  (hatched bars). cells were
then harvested and assayed for luciferase and b-galactosidase activities. reporter gene activity represents a-cardiac actin/luciferase activity of a given cell extract divided by the cmv/b-galactosidase activity
measured for that extract. the value obtained for each set of transfected
cells cultured in the absence of growth factors was set at 1.0. the actual
values of the pnkgfr and phkgfr transfectants cultured with no
growth factor were 72 and 62% that of the pbj5 transfectant, respectively. we showed that proliferating mm14 cells express  xxxd2829xxx .3 the
 xxxd2829xxx  that the mm14 cells are expressing may be sufficient to activate
the transfected kgfrs and partially repress activation of the reporter
construct. the results shown are representative of three individual
experiments.

i- xxxg786xxx  or
ever,  xxxg787xxx  was not as effective at competing for
125
i- xxxd2829xxx . these results support the qualitative binding assay
that the newt  xxxg792xxx  is specific for  xxxg786xxx  and  xxxd2829xxx . interestingly, in the presence of 125i- xxxd2829xxx ,  xxxg786xxx  appears to be a
more effective competitor than  xxxd2829xxx  for binding to the newt
 xxxg792xxx . this could reflect the fact that the newt  xxxg792xxx  may
have a higher affinity for  xxxg786xxx  than  xxxd2829xxx . alternatively,
this could be due to differences in newt and mammalian fgfs.
the size of the 150-kda band is greater than expected for a two
ig domain form of the newt  xxxg792xxx  based on its primary amino
acid sequence. likewise, other investigators have shown the
two ig domain form of  xxxg792xxx  cross-linked to labeled fgfs
migrating with an apparent size that is larger than predicted
from their primary amino acid sequences (17, 20). this difference in size is likely to be due to n-linked glycosylation of the
receptors as they have a number of potential n-linked glycosylation sites in their extracellular domain. the newt  xxxg792xxx  has
nine potential n-linked glycosylation sites, whereas the two ig
domain form of human bek and  xxxg792xxx  have six and seven,
respectively. the cdna encoding the newt  xxxg792xxx  that was
cloned into the pbj5 expression vector does harbor an upstream in-frame methionine which could code for an additional
19 amino acids (42) if translation were to start here. however,
the amino acids that follow this methionine do not exhibit an
overall hydrophobic character and would not be expected to
function as a secretory signal sequence. interestingly, the position of this upstream methionine is conserved in  xxxg792xxx 
cdnas isolated from other species, which may indicate that it
has some biological importance. at any rate, the higher molecular weight exhibited by the newt  xxxg792xxx  suggests more extensive post-translational modification. however, this modification does not affect either the biochemical properties or
functionality of this receptor (see below).
the specificity of the newt  xxxg792xxx  to different fgfs was
demonstrated in a more quantitative manner by competition
assays using labeled  xxxg786xxx  and  xxxd2829xxx  as tracers. unlabeled
 xxxg786xxx  and  xxxd2829xxx  were effective in competing with the two
labeled fgfs for binding to the newt  xxxg792xxx , whereas  xxxg787xxx 
was not an effective competitor at the concentrations used. the
human  xxxg792xxx  exhibited the same specificity for binding to
 xxxg786xxx  and  xxxd2829xxx  and confirms the results obtained by others
(18). as previously observed in the cross-linking analysis,
 xxxg786xxx  appears to be a more effective competitor than  xxxd2829xxx  for
binding of the newt  xxxg792xxx  to labeled  xxxd2829xxx . the apparent
higher affinity of the newt  xxxg792xxx  toward  xxxg786xxx  was confirmed
by scatchard analysis as  xxxg786xxx  and  xxxd2829xxx  exhibited dissociation constants of 660 and 860 pm, respectively.
to address whether the newt kfgr was capable of transducing a signal to the interior of a cell after binding to its
ligand, a functional assay was carried out in mouse mm14
myoblast cells transiently transfected with the newt  xxxg792xxx 
expression vector and an a-cardiac actin/luciferase reporter
plasmid. in the presence of exogenously added  xxxd2829xxx , both the
newt  xxxg792xxx  and human  xxxg792xxx  were capable of transducing the
signal required for repressing differentiation in these cells.
this was somewhat intriguing because the  xxxg792xxx  isoform of
 xxxg792xxx  is almost exclusively expressed in cells of epithelial
origin. in fact,  xxxg791xxx  is likely to be the only fgfr expressed
in mm14 cells (55).3 thus, despite the difference between the
cytoplasmic portions of  xxxg792xxx  and  xxxg791xxx , these two receptors
converge to the same signaling pathway within mm14 cells.
in conclusion, we provide evidence that a newt  xxxg792xxx  previously isolated in our laboratory is a functional receptor in that
it is capable of binding  xxxg786xxx  and  xxxd2829xxx  with high affinity but

not  xxxg787xxx  and is competent in transducing a proliferative
signal in cells expressing it. these results when combined with
the unique expression pattern observed in regenerating amphibian limbs indicate that  xxxg792xxx  may have a significant role
within the wound epithelium early in the regeneration process.
the appearance of the  xxxg792xxx  splice variant of  xxxg792xxx  in the
basal layer of the wound epithelium during amphibian limb
regeneration (40) is reminiscent of the expression of  xxxg792xxx  in
the epidermis in a wound healing study (56). in this study
 xxxd2829xxx  was shown to be induced 160-fold within the dermis of
the skin injury, whereas  xxxg786xxx ,  xxxg787xxx , and fgf-5 were induced only 2–10-fold, and  xxxg788xxx ,  xxxg789xxx , and  xxxg790xxx  were
undetected in normal and wounded skin. this suggests a possible paracrine role for the dermally expressed  xxxd2829xxx  acting on
the overlying epidermis during wound healing. in a similar
fashion, an amphibian  xxxd2829xxx  or  xxxd2829xxx -like molecule may be
involved in the regenerating amphibian limb. we hypothesize
that this putative amphibian  xxxd2829xxx  may act during the early
stages of regeneration in establishing and/or maintaining the
wound epithelium which is expressing  xxxg792xxx .
