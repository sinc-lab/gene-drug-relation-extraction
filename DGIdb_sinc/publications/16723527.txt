inflammation could be involved in some neurodegenerative disorders that accompany signs of inflammation. however, because
sensitivity to inflammation is not equal in all brain structures, a direct relationship is not clear. our aim was to test whether some
physiological circumstances, such as stress, could enhance susceptibility to inflammation in the prefrontal cortex (pfc), which
shows a relative resistance to inflammation. pfc is important in many brain functions and is a target for some neurodegenerative
diseases. we induced an inflammatory process by a single intracortical injection of 2 ␮g of lipopolysaccharide (lps), a potent
proinflammogen, in nonstressed and stressed rats. we evaluated the effect of our treatment on inflammatory markers, neuronal
populations, bdnf expression, and behavior of several mitogen-activated protein (map) kinases and the transcription factor
camp response element-binding protein. stress strengthens the changes induced by lps injection: microglial activation and
proliferation with an increase in the levels of the proinflammatory cytokine  xxxg2296xxx -␣; loss of cells such as astroglia,
seen as loss of  xxxg883xxx  immunoreactivity, and neurons, studied by neuronal-specific nuclear protein immunohistochemistry and  xxxg849xxx  and nmda receptor 1a mrnas expression by in situ hybridization. a significant increase in the
bdnf mrna expression and modifications in the levels of map kinase phosphorylation were also found. in addition, we observed
a protective effect from ru486 [mifepristone (11␤-[p-(dimethylamino)phenyl]-17␤-hydroxy-17-(1-propynyl)estra-4,9-dien-3one)], a potent inhibitor of the  xxxg1601xxx  activation. all of these data show a synergistic effect between inflammation
and stress, which could explain the relationship described between stress and some neurodegenerative pathologies.

introduction
pathological processes of neurodegeneration such as those observed in alzheimer’s (ad) and parkinson’s diseases are accompanied by an inflammatory reaction that is believed to contribute
to pathogenesis (akiyama et al., 2000). we previously studied the
involvement of inflammatory reactions in the degeneration of the
nigrostriatal dopaminergic system (tomás-camardiel et al.,
2004), which is preceded by extensive microglial activation in
substantia nigra (sn), suggesting the possible relationship between the two processes. however, despite the fact that evidence
for a chronic inflammatory reaction in the brain is particularly
strong in ad (mcgeer and mcgeer, 2004), no direct relationship
has been reported between the degenerative processes and inflammation in brain structures.
lipopolysaccharide (lps) is a potent inductor of inflammation and produces the activation of microglia and astrocytes

(lieberman et al., 1989; benveniste et al., 1990; chung and benveniste, 1990) and the induction of diverse cytokines (lee et al.,
1993; chao et al., 1995; jeohn et al., 1998). injection of lps in the
prefrontal cortex (pfc) does not have a similar effect as in sn
(kim et al., 2000). this suggests a lower response to lps challenge
in pfc than in other structures such as sn. thus, we sought for
conditions that could enhance the inflammatory response to lps
injection. regarding this, some conditions have been suggested as
circumstances to increase the risk of developing ad. stress is a
condition of human experience and includes not only major life
events but also the hassles of daily life that elevate activities of
physiological systems so as to cause disruption of ongoing homeostasis. it reflects individual experience and genetic background; therefore, reactions to a stressful incident are highly variable (mcewen, 2000, 2002). stress is widely acknowledged as a
predisposing and precipitating factor in psychiatric illnesses
(kendler and karkowski-shuman, 1997; caspi et al., 2003). repeated stress causes changes in the pfc and amygdala (mazure et
al., 1995; yokoyama and sasaki, 1999; wellman, 2001; trentani
et al., 2002; vyas et al., 2002; gerrits et al., 2003; radley et al.,
2004). evidence illustrates atrophy and cell death of stressvulnerable neurons in pfc; stress has been recognized as strongly
influencing cognitive and emotional processes subserved by pfc
(arnsten, 1998).
the aim of the present work was to test whether a chronic
variate stress could enhance the lps-induced damage in pfc.

immunohistochemical and molecular biology techniques were
combined in an effort to elucidate the effects of chronic stress,
intracortical lps injection, and a combination of both on different cell types of the pfc. we found that stress significantly increased the inflammatory damage induced by lps. thus, we also
studied the effect produced by ru486 [mifepristone (11␤-[p(dimethylamino)phenyl]-17␤-hydroxy-17-(1-propynyl)estra4,9-dien-3-one)], a potent inhibitor of the  xxxg1601xxx  (gr) activation, on the different parameters assayed.

materials and methods
animals and surgery. male albino wistar rats (200 –300 g) were used for
these studies. the rats were kept at constant room temperature of 22 ⫾
1°c and relative humidity (60%) with a 12 h light/dark cycle with access
to food and water ad libitum. rats were anesthetized with chloral hydrate
(400 mg/kg) and positioned in a stereotaxic apparatus (kopf instruments, tujunga, ca) to conform to the brain atlas of paxinos and
watson (1986). injections into the pfc were made 3.2 mm anterior, 1.3
mm lateral, and 3.5 mm ventral to the bregma.
experiments were performed in accordance with the guidelines of the
european union council (86/609/eu), following the spanish regulations (boe 67/8509-12, 1988) for the use of laboratory animals and
approved by the scientific committee of the university of seville.
five groups of animals were established according to the different
treatments. (1) the vehicle-injected group received a single dose of 2 ␮l
of monastral blue inert tracer (sigma, st. louis, mo) (1% in pbs) in the
left pfc. (2) the vehicle/stressed group received a single dose of 2 ␮l of
monastral blue inert tracer in the left pfc and was stressed for 9 d. (3)
the lps-injected group received a single dose of lps (2 ␮g; from escherichia coli, serotype 026:b6; sigma) dissolved in 2 ␮l of vehicle in the left
pfc. (4) the lps/stressed group received a single intracortical injection
of 2 ␮g of lps and was stressed for 9 d. (5) the lps/stressed/ru486
group received a single intracortical injection of 2 ␮g of lps, was stressed
for 9 d, and received a daily dose of ru486 (sigma) (20 mg/kg in saline
20% dmso) 1 h after the 9 d stress. all animals were killed by decapitation 10 d after surgery. at least five animals were used for each group.
body weight was measured at the beginning and at the end of the treatment. after killing the animals, the adrenal gland weight was evaluated as
an indirect parameter of hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal (hpa) axis
activation.
stress model. chronic variate stress was adapted from other models of
variate stress (willner et al., 1987; konarska et al., 1990; papp et al., 1991;
murua and molina, 1992; muscat et al., 1992; gamaro et al., 2003) with
modifications. animals were divided in stressed and nonstressed groups.
nonstressed animals were kept undisturbed in their home cages during
the 10 d of treatment. a 9 d variate-stressor paradigm was used for
animals in the stressed groups. individual stressors and length of time
applied each day are listed in table 1. the following stressors were used:
(1) 24 h of food deprivation; (2) 24 h of water deprivation; (3) 1–3 h of
restraint, as described below; (4) 1.5–2 h of restraint at 4°c; and (5)
forced swimming during 10 min, as described below. application of
stress started at a different time everyday to minimize predictability.
restraint was performed by placing the animal in a 21 ⫻ 6 cm plastic tube
and adjusting it with plaster tape on the outside so that the animal was

unable to move. there was a 6 cm hole at the far end for breathing. forced
swimming was performed by placing the animal in a glass tank measuring 44 ⫻ 33 ⫻ 30 cm with 22 cm of water depth at 23 ⫾ 2°c.
immunohistological evaluation:  xxxg883xxx , ox-6, and
neuronal-specific nuclear protein. rats were perfused through the heart
under deep anesthesia (chloral hydrate) with 150 –200 ml of 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate buffer, ph 7.4. the brains were removed and
then cryoprotected serially in sucrose in pbs, ph 7.4, first in 10% sucrose
for 24 h and then in 30% sucrose until sunk (2–5 d). brains were then
frozen in isopentane at ⫺15°c, and 25 ␮m sections were cut on a cryostat
and mounted in gelatin-coated slides. primary antibodies used were
mouse-derived anti- xxxg883xxx  (gfap) (1:300; chemicon, temecula, ca), mouse-derived ox-6 (1:200; serotec, oxford, uk)
and mouse-derived anti-neuronal nuclei [neuronal-specific nuclear protein (neun), 1:2000; chemicon]. sections were washed and then treated
with 0.3%  xxxd2298xxx  in methanol for 30 min, washed again, and
incubated in a solution containing tbs and 1% horse serum for 60 min in
a humid chamber. slides were drained and further incubated with the
primary antibody in tbs containing 1% horse serum and 0.25% triton
x-100 for 24 h. sections were then incubated for 2 h with biotinylated
horse anti-mouse igg (1:200; vector laboratories, burlingame, ca),
followed by a second 1 h incubation with extravidin peroxidase solution
(1:100; sigma). the antibody was diluted in tbs containing 0.25% triton x-100 (tbst), and its addition was preceded by three 10 min rinses
in tbs. the peroxidase was visualized with a standard diaminobenzidine/hydrogen reaction for 5 min.
histochemistry data analysis: quantification of tissue areas. an analysis
image software (soft imaging system, münster, germany) coupled to a
polaroid (bedfordshire, uk) dmc camera attached to a leica (nussloch,
germany) light microscope was used for all measurements. areas lacking
gfap and neun immunoreactivity were measured. cells showing ox-6
immunoreactivity were counted using five fields per section and five
sections per animal.
measurement of dopamine and 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic. hplc with
electrochemical detection was used for the determination of dopamine
(da) and its metabolite 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic (dopac). analyses
were performed as described previously (herrera et al., 1993). forty-five
animals were used for these experiments.
preparation of riboprobes. pbluescript sk plasmids, containing the
cdna sequence for  xxxd2431xxx  decarboxylase 67 ( xxxg849xxx ) as a 3.2 kb
ecori insert (clones 14 and 18), were kindly provided by dr. a. tobin
(university of california, los angeles, los angeles, ca). the  xxxg849xxx 
cdna was isolated from a 1 gt-11 cdna library made from poly(a) rna
from adult rat brain (erlander et al., 1991). to prepare the  xxxg849xxx  antisense transcript, clone 14 was digested with sali and used as a template
with the t3 rna polymerase. to prepare the  xxxg849xxx  sense transcript,
clone 18 was digested with sali and used as a template with the t3 rna
polymerase.
pbluescript sk plasmids, containing the cdna sequence for nmda
receptor 1a (nmdar1a) were kindly provided by dr. s. heinemann
(salk institute, san diego, ca). to prepare the nmdar1a antisense
riboprobe, plasmid pbluescript sk was linearized with ecori and used as
a template with the t7 rna polymerase. nmdar1a sense riboprobe
was generated after xholi digestion by using the t3 rna polymerase.
bdnf-specific riboprobes were transcribed from a 460 bp template of
rat bdnf codon subcloned into a pgem-4z vector (promega, madison,
wi) kindly provided by genentech (south san francisco, ca). sense and
antisense transcripts were generated using sp6 and t7 polymerases, respectively (research biochemicals, natick, ma) from hindiii and ecori
fragments of the vector.
sense and antisense riboprobes used for in situ hybridization were
transcribed in the presence of [ 35s]utp (1300 ci/mmol; amersham
biosciences, little chalfont, uk).
isotopic in situ hybridization histochemistry. in situ hybridization on
brain frozen sections was performed following a modification of a procedure described in detail previously (pasinetti et al., 1989). thawmounted 12 ␮m sections were postfixed for 30 min in 4% paraformaldehyde, followed by three 10 min washes in pbs, ph 7.4. sections were
treated for 1 min in 0.1 m triethanolamine, followed by 10 min in acetic

anhydride/0.1 m triethanolamine to decrease nonspecific binding. after a
1 min wash in 2⫻ ssc, sections were dehydrated in a series of increasing
concentrations of ethanol and then air dried. the sections were hybridized for 3 h at 50°c with the [ 35s] crna, rinsed in 4⫻ ssc/20 mm dtt,
and then 4⫻ ssc alone. sections were subjected to 30 min of rnase
digestion at 37°c (20 ␮g/ml  xxxg1963xxx  in 0.5 m nacl, 0.01 m tris-hcl, and
0.001 m edta, ph 8.0) and washed for 2 h in 2⫻ ssc at 25°c, followed
by 0.1⫻ ssc at 60°c for 1 h, dehydrated in a series of ethanols, air dried,
and processed for emulsion autoradiography. autoradiograms were generated by apposing the labeled tissue to ␤max hyperfilm (amersham
biosciences) for 2 weeks.
in situ hybridization data analysis. for quantification of gad and
nmdar1a mrna expression, films from dry-film autoradiography
were scanned at high resolution. for measurement of the areas lacking
gad and nmdar1a mrna, we used an analysis image software (soft
imaging system).
sds-page and western blotting of mitogen-activated protein kinases.
pfc was lysed in the following (in mm): 15 tris-hcl, ph 7.5, 150 nacl,
1 edta, 1 egta, and 1 pmsf (all from sigma). the homogenized was
centrifuged at 12,000 ⫻ g for 20 min at 4°c. protein content of the
samples was estimated by the method of microlowry using standard of
bsa (fryer et al., 1986); 25–50 ␮g of protein was loaded for each lane.
protein samples were separated by sds-page (10%) and transferred to
a nitrocellulose membrane (hybond-c extra; amersham biosciences).
membranes were blocked with blocking buffer (5% milk in tbs: 20 mm
tris-hcl, ph 7.5, 500 mm nacl, and 0.05% tween 20) for 1 h at room
temperature. membranes were then incubated using the following antibodies: anti-stress-activated protein kinase ( xxxg1372xxx )/c-jun n-terminal
protein kinase (jnk), anti-p38, anti-extracellular signal-regulated kinase
1/2 ( xxxg1369xxx /2), anti-akt1, and anti-camp response element-binding protein 1 ( xxxg515xxx ) (1:1000) for 1 h at room temperature in blocking buffer
(5% milk in tbs); and anti-phosphorylated (p)- xxxg1372xxx /jnk (thr183/
tyr185), anti-p-p38 (tyr 182), anti-p-akt (thr 308), anti-p- xxxg515xxx 
(ser 133), and anti-p- xxxg1369xxx /2 (1:500) overnight at 5°c in blocking buffer
(5% milk in tbs). all antibodies used were from santa cruz biotechnology (santa cruz, ca), and anti- xxxg1372xxx /jnk and anti-p- xxxg1372xxx /jnk were
from cell signaling technology (lake placid, ny). after incubation with

the primary antibodies, all membranes were
washed in tbst, incubated with peroxidaseconjugated anti-ig secondary antibodies (darostworowski et al., 1997
kocytomation, produktionsvej, denmark) at a
dilution of 1:3000 for 1 h at room temperature
meltzer et al., 1998
in tbst. proteins were visualized using western blotting chemiluminescence luminal relee et al., 2005
agent (santa cruz biotechnology). nonphosphorylated antibodies were used as loading

controls. all experiments were repeated in triplicate. the products were analyzed by densitometry using the quantity one 1-d analysis
software (bio-rad, hercules, ca).
reverse transcriptase-pcr. the left pfc was dissected from each rat 6 h
after treatment, snap frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at ⫺80°c.
tissue samples were homogenized in trizol reagent (invitrogen, carlsbad, ca), using 1 ml of trizol per 50 –100 mg of tissue. total rna was
extracted from the tissue according to the suggested protocol of the manufacturer. the rna was resuspended in pcr-grade water, and the concentration was calculated by a260 measurement. rna quality was assessed by electrophoresis on a 1% agarose gel.
first-strand cdna was synthesized from 3 ␮g of each rna using 200
ng of random hexamer primers and 0.5 mm dntps. the samples were
incubated at 25°c for 10 min and heated at 65°c for 5 min. afterward, 10
mm dtt, 100 u rnaseout recombinant ribonuclease inhibitor (invitrogen), and 1⫻ first-strand buffer (in mm: 250 tris-hcl, ph 8.3, 375
kcl, and 15 mgcl2) were added. samples were heated at 42°c for 2 min
and then 200 u of moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase
(rt) (superscript ii; invitrogen) were added to each tube. after incubation at 42°c for 50 min, the reaction was inactivated by heating at 70°c
for 15 min.
triplicate reverse transcription reactions were performed along with
an additional reaction in which the reverse transcriptase enzyme was
omitted to allow for assessment of genomic dna contamination in each
sample.
pcr was performed with 5 ␮l of cdna in 20 ␮l of pcr reaction mix
containing 40 pmol of each primer (table 2), 0.4 mm dntps, 2.5 u of
taqdna polymerase, 1.5 mm mgcl2, and 1⫻ pcr buffer (200 mm trishcl, ph 8.4, and 500 mm kcl). to determine optimal experimental
conditions for relative quantification of transcripts, rt-pcr was preliminary tested at several cycle numbers (20 – 40 cycles) with variable cdna
concentrations. samples were placed in a ptc-100 pcr system (mj
research, watertown, ma) at 94°c for 5 min, followed sequentially by a
cyclic phase of 26 cycles of denaturation at 94°c for 30 s, annealing at
55°c for 45 s, and extension at 72°c for 45 s, followed by a final elongation step at 72°c for 7 min. concurrently, rt-pcr amplification of
␤-actin was performed as an internal control for variations in the efficiencies of rna isolation and rt.
amplified products were separated by electrophoresis on a 1% agarose
gel, visualized over a uv transilluminator, and then photographed. the
products were analyzed by densitometry using analysis software, and
quantities of each product were calculated relative to ␤-actin.
statistical analysis. results are typically expressed as mean ⫾ sd.
means were compared by one-way anova. the least significance difference (lsd) test was used for post hoc multiple range comparisons.

results
changes in body and adrenal gland weights
stress exerted a negative effect on the bodyweight gain after the
injection of lps: whereas nonstressed animals maintained their
weight through the experiment, stressed rats lost 12.7% ( p ⬍
0.01) (fig. 1 a). conversely, stress caused an increase of 26.5% in
the adrenal gland weight ( p ⬍ 0.05) (fig. 1 b) and 43.9% in the
adrenal gland weight/body weight ratio ( p ⬍ 0.01) (fig. 1 b).
bodyweight and adrenal weight alterations are typical effects of
stress; these results agree with those of gamaro et al. (2003),
showing that the variate stress model applied to actually stressed
animals.

effect of stress on the cortical amounts
of da and dopac
variate stress increased amounts of da in
the cortex, with peaks of nearly fourfold
and twofold over the control values at days
2 and 8, respectively, after the beginning of
the treatment (table 3). the effect on
dopac was similar, with peaks of approximately twofold and threefold over
the control values at days 2 and 4, respectively (table 3). these results are in agreement with others, showing alterations in
dopamine content after stress (gamaro et
al., 2003) and a special sensitivity of pfc
dopaminergic neurons to different types
of stress (feenstra et al., 1998; abekawa et
al., 2000) compared with subcortical regions (matsumoto et al., 2005). the
changes observed in the parameters mentioned above may be considered an index
of the effectiveness of the chronic variate
stress model.
effect of lps and stress on microglia
microglial cells become activated (change
of morphology from resting resident ramified microglia with two or three fine processes to round cells resembling tissue
macrophages) and proliferate when challenged. injection of vehicle in nonstressed
animals (fig. 2 b, g) produced a slight microglial reaction, and it had a mild effect
on stressed animals (174.9% of control
values; p ⬍ 0.01) (fig. 2c,g), whereas lps
injection induces a stronger activation
(259.0% compared with the vehicleinjected animals; p ⬍ 0.01) (fig. 2 d, g).
combination of stress and lps produced
an additive effect (415.9% compared with
the vehicle-injected animals; p ⬍ 0.01)
(fig. 2 e, g) that was highly reduced for
ru486 (218.1% compared with the
vehicle-injected animals) (fig. 2 f, g).

the injection site of vehicle in nonstressed animals without loss of
gfap immunostaining (fig. 3 b, g), although we observed damage in stressed animals (0.15 mm 2; p ⬍ 0.01 compared with
control) (fig. 3c,g). astroglia disappeared around the injection
site of lps, showing an area absent of gfap-positive structures
but surrounded by hyper-reactive astrocytes (0.34 mm 2; p ⬍ 0.01
compared with the vehicle-injected animals) (fig. 3 d, g). stress
reinforces the effect of lps in a synergistic manner, producing an
increase in the area lacking astrocytes (0.83 mm 2; p ⬍ 0.01 compared with the vehicle-injected animals) (fig. 3 e, g). this effect
was reduced for ru486 (0.15 mm 2) (fig. 3 f, g).

effect of lps and stress on neuronal populations
additional neun immunostaining was performed to detect neurons in general and in situ hybridization for  xxxg849xxx  and
nmdar1a mrna expression, which coexpressed in pfc, for
detecting gabaergic neurons. immunohistochemistry with

neun resulted in the staining of both nucleus and cytoplasm
(fig. 4). this pattern was also seen in the pfc of vehicle-injected
rats (fig. 4 b, g) and in the contralateral (untouched) pfc after
lps injection. stress induces a loss of neun-positive neurons
around the injection site of vehicle (0.52 mm 2, p ⬍ 0.05 compared with the loss produced for the injection of vehicle in control animals, 0.02 mm 2) (fig. 4c,g) similar to that observed after
lps-injection in nonstressed animals ( p ⬍ 0.05 compared with
control) (fig. 4 d, g). when injected in stressed rats, an additive
effect was observed for lps ( p ⬍ 0.05 compared with control)
(fig. 4 e, g). this effect was reduced for ru486 (0.27 mm 2) (fig.
4 f, g).
the gabaergic system in the pfc represents an abundant
neuronal population, therefore showing a high level of expression of  xxxg849xxx  mrna (fig. 5). we evaluated the effect of stress
and lps on the gabaergic population by injecting either vehicle
or lps in nonstressed and stressed animals. the specificity of the

animals injected with vehicle displayed
few bdnf mrna-expressing cells in this
structure. these cells were so scarce that
we could not find more than one or two
positive cells per section (fig. 7 a, f ). similar results were found when vehicle was
injected into stressed animals (fig. 7 b, f ).
lps injections increased this number by a
factor of ⬃12 ( p ⬍ 0.01) (fig. 7c,f ),
whereas the addition of stress synergistically increased this factor to nearly 43 ( p ⬍
0.01) (fig. 7 d, f ). this strong upregulation of a subset of cortical neurons expressing bdnf mrna was confined to
around the injection site. ru486 reduced
the number of bdnf mrna-expressing
cells to ninefold of the control (fig. 7 e, f ).

necrosis factor-␣, interleukin-1␤, and
interleukin-6 levels
given that stress exacerbated the lps effect, we next sought to determine whether
it was attributable to the increase of inflammatory mediators or to a direct effect
of stress on microglia activation. rt-pcr
analysis showed that the mrnas for the
proinflammatory cytokines  xxxg2296xxx -␣ (tnf-␣), interleukin-1␤ ( xxxg1169xxx ␤), and il-6 were induced 6 h after lps
treatment. the expression levels of tnf-␣
mrna in the pfc (fig. 8 a, b) were affected by stress and lps. so, stress increased expression level to 128.6% of control values ( p ⬍ 0.01). similar results were
found after lps injection in nonstressed animals (136.9% compared with vehicle-injected animals; p ⬍ 0.01). when lps was
injected in stressed animals, expression levels of tnf-␣ reached
153.6% of control vehicle-injected nonstressed animals ( p ⬍
0.01). ru486 treatment reduced expression levels to 120.2% of
controls ( p ⬍ 0.01).
the expression levels of il-1␤ mrna (fig. 8 a, c) did not
change in vehicle-injected stressed animals (100.9% compared
with control) but increased in lps-injected nonstressed animals
(156.4% of vehicle-injected nonstressed animals; p ⬍ 0.01). similar levels were found when lps was injected in stressed animals
(153.8%; p ⬍ 0.01). ru486 reduced il-1␤ expression levels to
control values (108.6% of controls).
similar to il-1␤, the expression levels of il-6 in pfc (fig.
8 a, d) did not change in vehicle-injected stressed animals
(113.5% compared with control) but increased in lps-injected
nonstressed animals (158.7% of vehicle-injected nonstressed animals; p ⬍ 0.01). expression levels in lps-injected stressed animals reached 165.9% ( p ⬍ 0.01) of controls. ru486 reduced
expression levels to 130.0% of controls ( p ⬍ 0.01).

signals generated by the antisense-strand rna probe was also
confirmed using a sense probe (data not shown). neuronal loss
was not significant after injection of vehicle in nonstressed rats
(fig. 5 b, g) and increased slightly in stressed animals (152.2% of
control values) (fig. 5c,g) but was more evident after the injection of lps in nonstressed animals (280.0% compared with the
vehicle-injected animals; p ⬍ 0.01) (fig. 5 d, g). stress and lps
produced a synergistic effect (890.0% compared with the vehicleinjected animals; p ⬍ 0.01) (fig. 5 e, g). ru486 reduced the areas
losing expression of  xxxg849xxx  mrna to 200.0% (compared with
the vehicle-injected animals) (fig. 5 f, g).
nmdar1a mrna detected by in situ hybridization was
sparsely distributed throughout the pfc (fig. 6). sections hybridized with the sense nmdar1a probe were used as control
for nonspecific labeling (data not shown). the loss of nmdar1a
mrna expression observed after vehicle injection in nonstressed
animals was reduced to the injection track (0.37 mm 2) (fig.
6 b, g). vehicle-injection in stressed animals (181.8% compared
with the vehicle-injected animals; p ⬍ 0.01) (fig. 6c,g) was similar in lps-injected animals (207.3% compared with the vehicleinjected animals; p ⬍ 0.01) (fig. 6 d, g). nmdar1a mrna loss
increased when lps was injected into stressed rats (298.0% compared with the vehicle-injected animals; p ⬍ 0.01) (fig. 6 e, g).
again, this effect was reduced for ru486 near to control values
(122.7% compared with the vehicle-injected animals) (fig.

(glezer et al., 2003). stress activates the
glutamatergic system in the pfc more intensely than in other regions (gilad et al.,
1990; moghaddam, 1993; karreman and
moghaddam, 1996). the stress-induced
increase in dopamine release found by us
in the pfc at the beginning of the stressing
treatment could be a consequence of an
increased glutamatergic neurotransmission in this region (jedema and

excite gaba neurons and induce their

marmigere et al., 2003), whereas lps and stress activate glutamatergic (karreman and moghaddam, 1996; glezer et al., 2003) and
dopaminergic (abekawa et al., 2000; gamaro et al., 2003; matsumoto et al., 2005) systems, which induces bdnf expression
(zafra et al., 1990, 1991; kuppers and beyer, 2001). although
bdnf increases in pathological situations (felderhoff-mueser et
al., 2002) and seems to exert a protective activity (tapiaarancibia et al., 2004), some evidence suggests that neurotrophins strengthen or may even cause neuronal damage under
certain pathological conditions through the induction of
nadph-oxidase (koh et al., 1995; samdani et al., 1997; kim et
al., 2002). thus, bdnf could be involved in the increase of the
damage induced by inflammation in stressed animals.
all of these data allow us to suggest that inflammation along
with chronic stress induces a special situation that leads to increased damage and loss of neurons. however, damage produced
by stress can be prevented. inhibition of the rise of corticosteroids
levels during ischemia preserves cell survival after ischemia and
prevents seizures (krugers et al., 1995, 1998, 1999; smithswintoski et al., 1996); also, gr blockade with ru486 (a potent
inhibitor of gr activation) prevents ca1 neuron loss 24 h after
constriction nerve injury (mccullers et al., 2002). it is also known
that ru486 reverses glucocorticoid-mediated vulnerability to
glutamate in a cultured murine hippocampal cell line (behl et al.,
1997a). we found that treatment with ru486 produced a significant protection, reducing ox-6 reaction and loss of gfap immunoreactivity. ru486 also prevented the increase of the three
cytokines studied.

this pattern is maintained in the neuronal populations, showing a significant reduction of the loss of neun-positive neurons
and cells expressing  xxxg849xxx  and nmdar1a mrnas. moreover,
ru486 treatment also inhibits the increase in bdnf mrna expression in pfc during the injection of lps in stressed rats. the
protective effect of ru486 could be caused by its antiglucocorticoid effects combined with its antioxidant properties (behl et al.,
1997b). the antiglucocorticoid effects could prevent excessive
intracellular ca 2⫹ accumulation in neurons (elliott and sapolsky, 1993; mccullers et al., 2002). ru486 antioxidant effects may
mediate neuroprotection in ca1 pyramidal cells. it also prevents
oxidation of the low-density lipoprotein (parthasarathy et al.,

al., 1996).
this is also in agreement with the results found for mapk

 xxxd3215xxx . we found that stress, lps (through cytokines such as tnf-␣
and il-1␤), and the combination of both produced an increase in
the phosphorylation levels of jnk, p38, and erk; this was prevented by ru486 treatment. activation of jnk/ xxxg1372xxx  and p38 is
associated with promotion of apoptosis and plays an important
role in the pathogenesis of inflammatory responses (walton et
al., 1998). our results also show a marked reduction of creb
phosphorylation that is prevented by ru486 treatment. this is in
agreement with previous work reporting that chronic stress increased p-erk but significantly reduced p-creb expression in
pfc (kuipers et al., 2003). we found that tnf-␣ release induced
by lps is reinforced by stress and is prevented by ru486.
all of these results suggest a relationship between the inflammatory process and the increased basal activity of the
hpa axis that have been repeatedly demonstrated in ad, including increase in basal concentration of cortisol in plasma
(belanoff et al., 2001) along with a higher incidence of chronic
stress adaptation failure in patients with ad (pascualy et al.,
2000). it is well known that amyloid deposits are not exclusive
of ad patients but appear in most nondemented people after
the age of 65 years (sparks et al., 1993). pfc and probably
other cns structures could be less sensitive to inflammation
than to stress; a cooperative effect between the two processes
could explain the suggested relationship between stress and
ad, because a high susceptibility to distress leads to a double
risk of developing this disease (wilson et al., 2003). this is also
in agreement with the first evidence of a genetic association
between the glucocorticoid system and ad reported by de
quervain et al. (2004). set-association analysis revealed a rare
haplotype in the 5⬘ regulatory region of the gene encoding
11␤-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 ( xxxg1084xxx ) associated with a sixfold increased risk for sporadic ad.  xxxg1084xxx 
controls tissue levels of biologically active glucocorticoids and
thereby influences neuronal vulnerability. these results also
point to the possibility of using ru486 in ad, because different assays show that ru486 slows the progression of cognitive
decline in this disease (belanoff et al., 2002; debattista and
belanoff, 2005).
