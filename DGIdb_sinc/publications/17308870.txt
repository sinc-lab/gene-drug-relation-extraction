introduction

prostanoids (referring collectively to prostaglandins,
prostacyclin, and thromboxanes) are oxygenated, 20carbon fatty acid derivatives that regulate inflammation,
platelet aggregation, vascular homeostasis, and a variety
of other physiological responses (1). the biosynthesis of
prostanoids occurs through a well-established, three-stage
biochemical cascade, (a) the release of  xxxd208xxx 
(aa) from membrane phospholipids by phospholipase
a2 (pla2 ), (b) the cyclization and oxidation of aa to
pgh2 by the cyclooxygenases, and (c) the conversion of
pgh2 to the biologically active end products (e.g., pge2 ,
pgi2 , txa2 ) by the terminal synthases (pges1,  xxxg1880xxx , thromboxane synthase, respectively). the
two forms of cyclooxygenase, cox1 and cox2, are 60%
identical and are virtually indistinguishable from an enzymatic standpoint. however, due primarily to differences
in their transcriptional regulation, these enzymes have
clearly distinct functional roles in vivo [reviewed in (2)].
for example, cox-1 is expressed in nearly all mammalian
tissues and provides the cell with the ability to produce
prostanoids almost instantaneously. because of its broad
and constitutive expression, cox1 is thought to function
primarily as a “housekeeping” gene. in contrast, cox2 is
expressed at low levels in many tissue types under basal
conditions, but is increased dramatically following cellular stimulation with growth factors, cytokines, or other
stimuli resulting in a significantly enhanced, albeit delayed, cellular capacity to produce prostanoids.
because of its central and rate-limiting role in
prostanoid biosynthesis, loss of regulation of this pathway
at the level of cox2 expression can have pathophysiological effects. many inflammatory conditions—rheumatoid

cox2 (prostaglandin g/h synthase,  xxxg1884xxx ) is a well-validated
target in the fields of both oncology and inflammation. despite
their significant toxicity profile, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory
drugs (nsaids) have become standard of care in the treatment of many cox2-mediated inflammatory conditions. in this
r
immunomodulatory drug,
report, we show that one imids
 xxxd2984xxx , can reduce the levels of cox2 and the production
of prostaglandins (pg) in human lps-stimulated monocytes.
the inhibition of cox2 by  xxxd2984xxx  occurs at the level of
gene transcription, by reducing the lps-stimulated transcriptional activity at the cox2 gene. because it is a transcriptional
rather than an enzymatic inhibitor of cox2,  xxxd2984xxx  inhibition of pg production is not susceptible to competition by
exogenous arachadonic acid (aa). the distinct mechanisms of
action allow  xxxd2984xxx  and a cox2-selective nsaid to work additively to block pg secretion from monocytes.  xxxd2984xxx  does
not, however, block cox2 induction in or prostacyclin secretion
from  xxxg1170xxx  stimulated human umbilical vein endothelial cells
(huvec) cells, nor does it inhibit cox1 in either monocytes
or huvec cells.  xxxd2984xxx  also inhibits cox2 and pg production in monocytes derived from patients with sickle cell disease
(scd). taken together, the data in this manuscript suggest  xxxd2984xxx  will provide important anti-inflammatory benefit to patients and will improve the safety of nsaids in the treatment of
scd or other inflammatory conditions.

 xxxd2984xxx  regulation of  xxxg1884xxx  in monocytes

arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus (sle), and sickle
cell disease (scd)—are characterized by flares, which
are symptomatic episodes involving elevated inflammatory cell activity (3–5). flares can be associated with
increased expression of cox2 and successfully treated
with nsaids, suggesting that prostaglandins are important in the etiology and maintenance of these conditions
(6–10). many nsaids, although efficacious in the treatment of these conditions, have serious side-effects [for
review see (11)]. for example, nsaids such as aspirin
(asa) can lead to severe gastric ulceration and bleeding
by inhibiting cox1 and the gastro-protective pgs it produces. cox2-selective inhibitors are associated with an
increased cardiovascular risk due, in part, to inhibition of
cox2 in endothelial cells. thus, there is an urgent need to
develop cox inhibitors with improved safety profiles. in
this report we describe  xxxd2984xxx , a structural analogue of
thalidomide with potent in vitro activity and clinical efficacy (12–15), as a novel transcriptional inhibitor of cox2
that may provide anti-inflammatory benefit and improved
safety in the treatment of scd or other inflammatory
conditions.

materials and methods

primary cells
mononuclear cells were obtained from healthy donor
buffy coats (san diego blood bank) or sickle cell patient
whole blood aphereses (loma linda university). monocytes were purified using  xxxd3253xxx  paque (amersham) and
cd14 microbeads (miltenyi) according to manufacturer’s
instructions and then were cultured overnight in rpmi1640 (gibco) with 10% fbs at 37◦ c in 5% co2 prior
to treatment. huvec cells (cambrex) were cultured in
egm2 media with the singlequots growth supplement
at 37◦ c in 5% co2 . huvec cells used in experiments
were freshly thawed, low passage and not allowed to reach
confluence during expansion or prior to experimentation.
compounds and reagents
r
 xxxd2984xxx  and imids
immunomodulatory drugs (celgene corporation, summit, nj), ns-398, indomethacin,
aspirin (cayman chemicals) and  xxxd208xxx 
(sigma) were dissolved in  xxxd1896xxx  (dmso).
the final concentration of dmso in all experiments was
0.03%. cells were pretreated with compounds for 30 min
prior to addition of stimulus.  xxxg524xxx  (biosource), lps
(b5:0055, sigma), and  xxxg1170xxx  (r&d systems) were administered to cells in serum-free growth media.

prostaglandin measurements
monocytes from healthy donors or from scd patients
were plated in 96-well plates at 100,000 cells/well in a
volume of 200 µl, pretreated with dmso or  xxxd2984xxx 
(1 µm), and stimulated with 100 ng/ml lps. spent culture
media was collected at 18 h and the levels of pge2 , prostacyclin (pgi2 ) and thromboxane b2 (txb2 ) were measured
by elisa (r&d systems) according to manufacturer’s
instructions. for experiments with exogenous aa (fig. 4),
monocytes were treated with aspirin (50 µm) or dmso
for 30 min and washed 3 times in complete media. the
cells were then replated, pretreated with dmso,  xxxd2984xxx 
(1 µm), or ns-398 (0.5 µm) for 30 min, and stimulated
with lps (100 ng/ml). 18 h after stimulation, spent culture
media was completely removed and processed for pge2
elisa. in the asa/aa group, serum-free media with
exogenous aa (10 µm) and either dmso,  xxxd2984xxx ,
or ns-398 at indicated concentrations was added to the
cells, incubated for 20 min at 37◦ c, collected and processed for pge2 elisa. for combination experiments
(fig. 6), ns-398, indomethacin, or dmso at indicated
doses were incubated with cells for 30 min, then dmso
or  xxxd2984xxx  (1 µm or 100 nm) was added for an additional
30 min prior to stimulation with lps (100 ng/ml). spent
culture media was collected after 18 h and assayed for
pge2 by elisa. huvec were serum starved overnight
in endothelial cell serum-free defined media (cell applications, inc.), pretreated for 30 min with dmso or  xxxd2984xxx  (1 µm), and stimulated with  xxxg1170xxx  (2.5 ng/ml). after
18 h, spent culture media was collected and processed for
pgi2 by elisa.
chromatin immunoprecipiation
monocytes were pretreated with  xxxd2984xxx  (1 µm) or
dmso for 30 min and stimulated with 100 ng/ml lps for
0, 1, 4, 6, 8 h. cells were harvested in fixation buffer
(11% paraformaldehyde, 0.1 m nacl, 1 mm edta,
50 mm hepes ph 7.9) at 25◦ c for 15 min, quenched
with 2.5 m glycine for 5 min, permeabilized and washed
three times on ice with 0.5% igepal ca-630 in pbs, and
frozen at −80◦ c until use. chromatin immunoprecipitation was performed using a previously validated antibody
to rnapii and cox2 pcr amplicon (+1791) by genpathway corporation (www.genpathway.com, san diego,
ca) according to standard methods (16).
western blotting
following the stimulation of monocytes with 100 ng/ml
lps and huvec cells with 2.5 ng/ml  xxxg1170xxx  for 18 h,
cells were washed with pbs, lysed directly in 2x sds

212

loading buffer (invitrogen) that had been preheated to
90◦ c, boiled for 10 min, and stored at −20◦ c. equal
amounts of cellular extract were resolved on 4–20% tris
glycine gel (invitrogen), transferred to nitrocellulose, and
stained with ponceau red (gibco) to confirm efficient
transfer. membranes were blocked with 5% molecular
biology grade nonfat dried milk (biorad) in tbs, probed
with cox1, cox2 (cayman chemical), or  xxxg53xxx 
(sigma) antibodies, and washed with tbs-t. blots were
probed with hrp- or alexa-conjugated secondary antibodies and were visualized by either ecl (amersham)
and autoradiographic film or with odyssey infrared imaging (licor), with similar results.
real time pcr
rna was obtained from monocytes, macrophage, and
huvec cells using cell-to-signal lysis (ambion) buffer
or rneasy kit (qiagen) according to manufacturer’s instructions. first strand cdna synthesis and pcr was performed with the one-step superscript iii qpcr kit (invitrogen) using taqman probes for cox1, cox2, il-8
and  xxxg861xxx , and amplified in a 7900ht real-time qpcr
instrument (applied biosystems) using established methods. relative gene expression, normalized to  xxxg861xxx ,
was calculated using a standard curve methodology.
statistics
treatment and dependent measures were analyzed using two-way anova with post hoc comparisons by bonferroni. data with two groups was analyzed by student’s
unpaired two-tailed t tests. the graphpad instat3 statistics
module was used for all calculations. significance was set
 xxxd2216xxx  < 0.05.
results

we have shown previously that  xxxd2984xxx  can inhibit the
production of tnf-alpha, il-6, and cox2 in lps-stimulated
peripheral blood mononuclear cells (pbmcs) (17). to
monitor  xxxd2984xxx  gene regulation in a more defined cell
system, we examined the expression of these and other
genes in purified primary human monocytes using the
affymetrix genechip platform. indeed, tnf-alpha, il-6, and
cox2 mrna are reduced by  xxxd2984xxx  in lps-treated
monocytes (data not shown), suggesting that the inhibitory
activity of  xxxd2984xxx  on gene expression has a direct effect
on monocytes. we examined, in more detail, the kinetics of cox2 induction and inhibition by  xxxd2984xxx  in
lps-stimulated monocytes using quantitative, real-time
rt-pcr (qpcr). cox2 mrna levels increase rapidly

ferguson

et al.

following the addition of lps, stay elevated for approximately 6 h, and decay to near baseline by 15 h (fig. 1a).
when monocytes are stimulated with lps in the presence
of  xxxd2984xxx , cox2 mrna accumulation is significantly
reduced (f[1,17] = 24.46; p < 0.0001). post hoc analysis reveals that this inhibition is significant at each of the
time points examined following stimulation (p < 0.003),
except in unstimulated samples (p = 0.65). similar results
were obtained in monocytes that had been differentiated
to macrophages with  xxxg524xxx  (100 ng/ml) for 3 days prior
to lps stimulation and treatment with  xxxd2984xxx  (fig. 1c).
the inhibition of cox2 in lps-stimulated monocytes by
 xxxd2984xxx  is dose-dependent with an ec50 = 12.2 nm,
r2 = 0.89 (fig. 1b).  xxxd2984xxx   xxxd1891xxx  µm gave no further
inhibition (data not shown). ns-398 (18), a cox2 selective enzymatic inhibitor, does not alter the levels of cox2
mrna following stimulation with lps (fig. 1b). interestingly,  xxxd2984xxx  does not significantly alter the levels of
cox1 mrna in unstimulated or lps-stimulated monocytes (f[1,19] = 1.31, p = 0.28) (fig. 1d). these data
indicate that the  xxxd2984xxx  effect was specific for cox2
with regard to the cox family.
to investigate the mechanism of cox2 inhibition by
 xxxd2984xxx , we utilized chromatin immunoprecipitation
(chip). the chip technique has been used extensively
to characterize the transcriptional activation state of defined genomic loci (16, 19), including the cox2 locus.
the transcriptional activity was assessed by the levels
of rna polymerase ii (rnapii) bound to the cox2
gene (20–23). rnapii occupancy of the cox2 gene is
low in unstimulated (time 0) monocytes, but increases to
near maximal levels by 1 h after lps stimulation and
remains elevated for at least 8 h (fig. 2a). when compared to dmso-treated controls,  xxxd2984xxx  causes a significant reduction in rnapii occupancy of the cox2 gene
[f(1,4) = 17.44, p = 0.0005]. post hoc analysis revealed
that this reduction is significant only at the 4- and 6-h time
points (p < 0.05). interestingly, there was no inhibition
in this assay at 1 h, indicating that the  xxxd2984xxx  effect
did not occur immediately. in a parallel experiment using
monocyte extracts from the same donor, we measured the
steady state levels of cox2 mrna by qpcr. much like
the rnapii chi.p.,  xxxd2984xxx  did not have an inhibitory
effect on cox2 mrna levels until greater than 1 h after
lps stimulation. at later time points, the level of inhibition was 30–50% and similar to that observed in fig. 1.
thus, the steady state levels of cox2 mrna correlate
well with the occupancy of cox2 by rnapii, suggesting
that the cox2 inhibition by  xxxd2984xxx  in lps-stimulated
monocytes is predominantly through transcriptional
regulation.

panel), cox1 (middle panel), and  xxxg53xxx  (lower panel) protein in unstimulated or lps-stimulated monocytes in the presence of  xxxd2984xxx  (1 µm)
or dmso. quantitation of cox2 protein is normalized to  xxxg53xxx  and expressed as percent control relative to dmso treatment. (b) pge2 , (c)
prostaclycin pgi2 , and (d) thromboxane b2 (txb2 ) levels measured in spent culture from lps-stimulated (black bars) or unstimulated (white bars)
monocytes treated with  xxxd2984xxx  (1, 10, 100, or 1000 nm) or ns-398 (500 nm). columns and error bars represent mean ± sem.

the effect of  xxxd2984xxx  on cox2 protein and prostanoid
production was also measured in lps-stimulated monocytes. as shown by western blot in fig. 3a, the levels
of cox2 protein increase following lps stimulation and
are significantly reduced by  xxxd2984xxx  (dmso treated =
100 ± 12%;  xxxd2984xxx  treated = 52 ± 12%; p < 0.05).
similar to its mrna, the level of cox1 protein is unchanged by  xxxd2984xxx  in lps-stimulated monocytes (fig.
3a). the production of pge2 is inhibited by  xxxd2984xxx  in a
dose-dependent manner with an ec50 of 22 nm (fig. 3b).
this value is very near that observed for cox2 mrna
inhibition, indicating that the levels of cox2 and pge2
are tightly coupled in monocytes. the levels of prostacyclin (pgi2 ) and thromboxane b2 (txb2 ) are also inhibited by  xxxd2984xxx  in a dose-dependent fashion (fig. 3c
and d). the broad effect of  xxxd2984xxx  on prostanoid production suggests that the inhibition occurs at the level
of cox2 rather than at the level of individual terminal
synthases.
nsaids are competitive enzymatic inhibitors of cyclooxygenases and, as such, are highly influenced by aa
substrate concentration. in the body, much higher levels of nsaids are often required to achieve therapeutic

inhibition of cox2 than would be predicted by in vitro
enzymatic assays due to the excess of aa present in highly
inflamed areas (24). we have previously shown that  xxxd2984xxx  is not an enzymatic inhibitor of either cox1 or
cox2 (17). because  xxxd2984xxx  is a transcriptional rather
than an enzymatic inhibitor of cox2, we hypothesized
that inhibition of pg secretion by  xxxd2984xxx  will be insensitive to the concentration of aa. to test this hypothesis, we measured pge2 secreted from lps-stimulated
and  xxxd2984xxx  or ns-398 treated monocytes in the presence of excess aa substrate (fig. 4). monocytes were
first pretreated with asa or dmso for 30 min, washed
extensively, and then replated. aspirin irreversibly inactivates cox enzymes through acetylation of a serine
residue near the active site (ser529, human cox1; ser 516,
human cox2) and is used here to inactivate preexisting cox enzyme, which is primarily cox1 in unstimulated monocytes [(25) and data not shown]. monocytes
were stimulated with lps in the presence of compound
( xxxd2984xxx , ns-398, or dmso), and then some groups
were administered excess substrate (exogenous aa) after 18 h. when compared to unstimulated samples, lps
strongly increases the production and secretion of pge2

 xxxd2984xxx  regulation of  xxxg1884xxx  in monocytes

fig. 4.  xxxd2984xxx  inhibition of pge2 production in lps-stimulated
monocytes is substrate independent. (left axis) monocytes were pretreated with dmso (black bars) or asa (white bars), washed, and then
stimulated with lps in the presence of dmso,  xxxd2984xxx  (1 µm), or
ns-398 (0.5 µm). spent culture media was collected after 16 h and
assayed for pge2 . (right axis) monocytes were pretreated with asa
(hatched bars), washed, and stimulated as above. spent culture media
was removed after 16 h and replaced with serum-free media containing
indicated compounds and aa (10 µm). after 20 min this media was
collected and assayed for pge2 . columns and error bars represent mean
± sem.

in all samples tested. asa pretreatment did not substantially alter the overall levels of pge2 , suggesting that
cox1 plays a minor role over the time frame and conditions of this experiment. ns-398 efficiently blocks the
production of pge2 in samples pretreated with asa or
dmso in which no exogenous aa was added. however,
exogenous aa (10 µm) completely reverses the inhibition provided by ns-398. in contrast, pge2 production

215

in  xxxd2984xxx  treated samples is reduced in all conditions
tested, whether or not exogenous aa had been added. in
addition, the level of inhibition, approximately 40–50%,
is consistent across the conditions. this data indicates that
 xxxd2984xxx  works independently of aa substrate concentration, supports the fact that it is not an enzymatic inhibitor of cox enzyme, and suggests that  xxxd2984xxx  may
be a more effective inhibitor of cox2 than traditional
nsaids at highly inflamed areas in the body where aa
is abundant.
clinical studies conducted on the cox2-selective inhibitor rofecoxib revealed an elevated risk for acute myocardial infarction and thromboembolism in patients who
had taken the drug for greater than 18 months, leading to
its withdrawal from the market (26). the increased cardiovascular risk is derived, at least in part, from the inhibition
of cox2 and prostacyclin production in the endothelium.
to examine cox2 inhibition by  xxxd2984xxx  in this context,
we measured cox2 levels and prostacyclin production in
human umbilical vein endothelial cells (huvec). huvec cells are used as a cellular model of the endothelium and we observe that they express high levels of the
lps receptor  xxxg2290xxx  (tlr4) and produce
 xxxg562xxx  (il-8) in response to lps [(27, 28) and data
not shown]. however, in our system, lps does not significantly increase the levels of cox2 or the production
of prostacyclin in huvec; further, neither of them are
modulated by  xxxd2984xxx  (f[1,17] = 1.12; p = 0.41). we
were, therefore, unable to study lps-stimulated cox2
expression in huvec cells. because lps signal transduction through tlr4 is mechanistically very similar to
il-1 signaling (29), we examined  xxxd2984xxx  effects in  xxxg1170xxx  stimulated huvec.  xxxg1170xxx  leads to a large increase in
the levels of cox2 mrna, reaching maximal levels by
15 h (fig. 5a). in contrast to monocytes,  xxxd2984xxx  has no
effect on the levels of cox2 mrna or protein at any time

fig. 5. cox2 levels and pgi2 production are not inhibited by  xxxd2984xxx  in  xxxg1170xxx  stimulated huvec cells. (a) cox2 mrna was measured by
qrt-pcr in the presence of dmso (filled circles) or  xxxd2984xxx  (open circles) at 0, 3, 6, 9, 15, or 24 h following  xxxg1170xxx  stimulation of huvec cells.

of  xxxd2984xxx  (1, 10, 100, 1000 nm) or ns-398 (0.5 µm). columns or points and error bars represent mean ± sem.

point examined (fig. 5a and b). moreover, prostacyclin
production and cox2 mrna levels are insensitive to any
dose of  xxxd2984xxx  in  xxxg1170xxx  stimulated huvec (fig. 5c).
ns-398 efficiently blocks prostacyclin production, but not
cox2 mrna accumulation in huvec (fig. 5c). the
levels of cox1 are also unchanged by stimulation with
 xxxg1170xxx  or by the presence of  xxxd2984xxx  (fig. 5b). therefore,  xxxd2984xxx  does not inhibit cox2 in huvec cells,
which may provide improved safety relative to currently
used nsaids.
the mechanism of cox2 inhibition by  xxxd2984xxx  is different from the enzymatic inhibition of cox2 provided
by nsaids and we therefore hypothesized that  xxxd2984xxx 
and nsaids would work additively to inhibit pge2 production from lps-stimulated monocytes. we tested the
cox2-selective nsaid, ns-398, in combination with
 xxxd2984xxx . initially, the pge2 inhibitory activity of ns398 alone in monocytes was measured and found to be
5.0 nm (data not shown), in agreement with previously
published reports in other cell types (30). for the subsequent combination experiments, the ic50 value for ns398 was bracketed by at least one higher and one lower
dose to allow maximum sensitivity of  xxxd2984xxx  inhibition.
when ns398 and  xxxd2984xxx  were administered together in
lps-stimulated monocytes, an additive inhibitory effect
was observed (fig. 6a). overall, the addition of  xxxd2984xxx 
significantly reduces pge2 production beyond that observed for ns398 alone (f[2,22] = 8.01; p < 0.001).
post hoc analysis revealed that the inhibition by 1 µm
but not 100 nm  xxxd2984xxx  was statistically significant
when compared to dmso-treated monocytes ( xxxd2984xxx 
1 µm vs. dmso p < 0.05;  xxxd2984xxx  100 nm vs. dmso,
p = 0.22). we also examined nsaid administration with
 xxxd2984xxx  in huvec cells stimulated with  xxxg1170xxx . in these

ferguson

et al.

cells, ns398 inhibited pgi2 production with an ic50 of
24.8 nm. however,  xxxd2984xxx  did not inhibit pgi2 production in  xxxg1170xxx  stimulated huvec beyond that provided by
ns398 alone (f[2,14] = 0.11; p = 0.88) (fig. 6b). thus,
 xxxd2984xxx  and ns-398 additively inhibit pg secretion from
lps-stimulated monocytes, suggesting that compounds or
other nsaids may be an efficacious and safe combination
when used together in vivo.
sickle cell disease (scd) is an inherited disease of the
red blood cells that leads to anemia, serious infections,
organ damage, and vaso-occlusive episodes (4). clinical
evidence suggests cox2 and pgs may mediate, at least
in part, the inflammation and pain of scd. for example,
serum pge2 levels are elevated in patients with scd (31,
32). in addition, nsaids are used to treat inflammation
and pain by patients with scd. celgene has began to
evaluate  xxxd2984xxx  in scd based on the preclinical observation that  xxxd2984xxx  increases fetal hemoglobin (hbf)
in erythroid progenitor cells obtained from the peripheral
blood of patients with scd (33). reactivation of hbf expression is a well-established and standardized treatment
for scd (34). to explore the potential relevance of cox2
inhibitory activity of  xxxd2984xxx  in the context of scd,
we measured cox2 levels and prostaglandin production
in monocytes isolated from patients with scd. lps is
of particular relevance as a stimulus for monocytes in
scd because of the enhanced susceptibility and increased
mortality due to bacterial infections; although infections
are most common during childhood, many individuals
continue to suffer from them throughout their adult life
(4, 35). lps promotes a rapid rise in cox2 mrna in
monocytes from scd patients, with an induction profile
similar to that observed in healthy patients. when compared to dmso treatment,  xxxd2984xxx  leads to a significant

were stimulated with lps in the presence of increasing concentrations of ns-398 (0.5, 5, 50 nm) and dmso or  xxxd2984xxx  (100 nm, 1 µm). pge2
was measured and results expressed as percent control (lps-stimulated in the presence of dmso only, 100%). (b) huvec cells were stimulated
with  xxxg1170xxx  in the presence of increasing concentrations of ns-398 (2.5, 25, 250 nm) and dmso or  xxxd2984xxx  (100 nm, 1 µm). pgi2 was measured
and results expressed as percent control ( xxxg1170xxx  stimulated in the presence of dmso only, 100%). columns and error bars represent mean ± sem.

reduction in the lps-stimulated levels of cox2 mrna
(fig. 7) (f[1,24] = 36.84, p < 0.0001). furthermore,
the secretion of pge2 from these cells is also significantly
reduced by  xxxd2984xxx . this data indicate that  xxxd2984xxx  has
inhibitory effects on monocytes derived from scd donors
and suggests that it may be an effective treatment for scd
by reducing cox2 induction and the sequelae of elevated
pge2 secretion.

inhibits pg secretion in the presence of exogenous aa
(fig. 4), suggesting  xxxd2984xxx  will have greater efficacy
than nsaids at highly-inflamed and aa-rich regions of
the body. second, because of its distinct mechanism of action relative to nsaids,  xxxd2984xxx  works additively with
ns-398 to inhibit pge2 production in lps-stimulated
monocytes. based on this data, we speculate that  xxxd2984xxx 
could reduce the amount of nsaid required to achieve
comparable levels of pg inhibition by as much as 10-fold.
 xxxd2984xxx  may therefore function effectively in combination with nsaids in vivo, by allowing a dose reduction
of nsaids without loss of efficacy, thereby increasing
the therapeutic window of these compounds. third,  xxxd2984xxx  does not reduce prostacyclin production in il-1b
stimulated huvec cells (fig. 5), suggesting it will be
safer than the cox2 selective enzymatic inhibitors that
block prostacyclin secretion from the endothelium.
our data indicate that the inhibition of cox2 by  xxxd2984xxx  in monocytes occurs primarily at the level of gene
transcription. numerous other small molecules have been
shown to inhibit the levels of cox2 in monocytes or
macrophage-derived cell lines (36–38). however, these
compounds appear to function primarily as signal transduction inhibitors rather than transcriptional inhibitors per
se, and generally require higher concentrations to observe
potency. the data in this manuscript is, to our knowledge, the first to describe a small molecule affecting the
transcriptional machinery (i.e. rnapii occupancy) that
drives lps-induced expression of cox2. the kinetics
and magnitude of the decrease in rnapii occupancy of
cox2 correlates well with the change in steady state levels of cox2 mrna; both are unaffected by  xxxd2984xxx  at

discussion

the loss of appropriate regulation of cox2, because
of its central and rate-limiting role in the pg biosynthetic
pathway, can have profound physiological consequences.
although efficacious in the treatment of a large number
of inflammatory conditions, many nsaids are of limited value because of their narrow therapeutic window.
here we show that  xxxd2984xxx , a structural analogue of
thalidomide, can reduce the expression of cox2 and the
production of pgs in lps-stimulated monocytes. this
and other properties described in this manuscript suggest
that  xxxd2984xxx , when administered together in vivo, may
improve the safety and efficacy of nsaids. first, one of
the major limitations of nsaids is that they often need
to be pushed to doses well beyond that required to inhibit
cox in vitro because of excessive local concentrations
of aa, resulting in higher rates of side-effects (24). we
predicted that  xxxd2984xxx , but not the cox2 selective enzymatic inhibitor and nsaid ns-398, would be insensitive
to an excess of aa substrate because it is a transcriptional
inhibitor of cox2. indeed,  xxxd2984xxx , but not ns-398,

fig. 7.  xxxd2984xxx  reduces the levels of cox2 and the production of pge2 in monocytes from patients with sickle
cell disease. (a) cox2 mrna levels were measured in purified human monocytes from scd patients by qrt-pcr at
indicated times (0, 3, 6, 9, 15, 24 h) following lps stimulation in the presence of  xxxd2984xxx  (1 µm, open circles) or
dmso vehicle control (filled circles). (b) pge2 levels were measured in spent culture media from scd monocytes
that had been stimulated with lps in the presence of dmso or  xxxd2984xxx  (1 µm). columns and error bars represent
mean ± sem.

1 h, but are significantly inhibited to comparable levels by
 xxxd2984xxx  at 4 h or more (fig. 2). the time course of  xxxd2984xxx  action may reflect the recruitment of inhibitory elements through de novo gene expression, chromatin remodeling, or other molecular events. for example, a dominant
negative form of c/ebpbeta, lip (for liver-enriched transcriptional inhibitory protein), is induced by lps in liver
and can inhibit a cox-2 reporter in lps-stimulated raw
264.7, a murine macrophage-derived cell line (39, 40).
it is possible that a  xxxd2984xxx  regulated, lip-dependent
mechanism may be functioning in monocytes to inhibit
cox2. alternatively,  xxxd2984xxx  may inhibit cox2 expression through epigenetic mechanisms by modulating the
expression or activity of histone deacetylases (hdacs)
or histone acetyltransferases. the hdac inhibitor  xxxd3426xxx  enhances the lps-induced expression of cox2
and lps itself upregulates the expression of multiple
hdacs (41). it is possible that other mechanisms also
contribute to cox2 inhibition by  xxxd2984xxx  under certain
conditions and in other cell-types. for example, it has been
r
immunomodushown that thalidomide or certain imids
latory drugs can decrease the stability of cox2 mrna in
human peripheral blood mononuclear cells and monocytic
cell lines (17, 42). further studies will be required to fully
elucidate the molecular mechanism of cox2 inhibition
by  xxxd2984xxx  in monocytes and in other cell types.
lps, despite leading to reliable increases of il-8, is
a poor inducer of cox2 in huvec cells. as measured
by global changes in gene expression, we find that huvec cells are less responsive to lps or to  xxxd2984xxx 
when compared with other stimuli or other compounds
(data not shown). consistent with the notion that huvec
cells are relatively insensitive to  xxxd2984xxx , the secretion
of soluble vcam, a marker of endothelial activation,
was not altered by  xxxd2984xxx  in patients being treated for
relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma (43). although  xxxg1170xxx  promotes large increases in cox2 and prostacyclin
secretion in huvec cells,  xxxd2984xxx  does not modulate
 xxxg1170xxx  induced cox2 or prostacyclin levels. in the context of cox2 inhibition, it would be of clear benefit to
avoid cox2 inhibition in the endothelium. the cox2selective enzymatic inhibitors celecoxib or rofecoxib have
been linked to increased risk for myocardial infarction
and stroke due, at least in part, to their inhibition of
cox2 in the endothelium (11, 26). it is thought that inhibition of prostacyclin production in endothelial cells
shifts the overall prostanoid balance toward a prothrombotic state. although the ‘prostacyclin-thromboxane balance’ hypothesis may not be completely accurate, it is
perhaps the most parsimonious model to explain the complex biology behind the toxicities associated with cox2selective inhibitors. the lack of cox2 and prostacyclin

inhibition in huvec cells by  xxxd2984xxx  may therefore,
provide additional safety to patients taking this drug
therapeutically.
the findings in this manuscript suggest that  xxxd2984xxx 
may be used for inflammatory conditions like scd in
which cox2 has been implicated or for which nsaids
have been used successfully as a treatment. celgene began to assess the efficacy of  xxxd2984xxx  in scd based
largely on the preclinical observation that  xxxd2984xxx  increases the expression of hbf in erythroid progenitor
cells isolated from the peripheral blood of scd patients
(33). the only fda-approved therapy currently available
for scd is hydroxyurea (marketed in the u.s. under the
name  xxxd2304xxx ), which also provides benefit by increasing
hbf. other modes of treatment for scd involve nsaids
and focus primarily on the management of inflammation and pain. for example, over-the-counter nsaids
are routinely used in the treatment of mild-to-moderate
painful episodes in scd. furthermore, the prescription
nsaid ketoroloc is currently in phase iv clinical trials
for the management of moderate-to-severe pain in scd
(http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/). here we show that  xxxd2984xxx  reduces the level of cox2 and pg production in
lps-stimulated monocytes derived from scd patients.
therefore,  xxxd2984xxx  has in vitro effects in two different
hematologic cell types: it elevates hbf in cd34 progenitor cells and inhibits cox2 in monocytes. we anticipate
that both of these attributes of  xxxd2984xxx  will translate
into the clinic and will provide benefit for patients with
scd.
r
ccin conclusion, we have shown that the imids
4047 reduces the induction of cox2 and the production
of pgs in monocytes stimulated with lps. the mechanism of inhibition is novel; occurring at the level of
cox2 gene transcription, due to reduced rnapii occupancy of the cox2 gene. in contrast to nsaids,  xxxd2984xxx  is not sensitive to competition by exogenous aa,
indicating that it may be more efficacious than nsaids
at aa-rich, highly inflamed areas of the body. because
of their distinct mechanisms of action, an nsaid and a
 xxxd2984xxx  work additively to block pg secretion from lpsstimulated monocytes.  xxxd2984xxx  does not inhibit cox2 in
 xxxg1170xxx  stimulated huvec cells, suggesting that it may not
suffer from the cardiovascular liabilities associated with
cox2-selective enzymatic inhibitors such as rofecoxib.
we show that  xxxd2984xxx  can also inhibit cox2 induction
and pg production in lps-stimulated monocytes from patients with scd. the unique transcriptional mechanism of
action, potency for cox2 inhibition, and cell-selectivity
of  xxxd2984xxx  indicate that it may increase the efficacy and
improve the safety of nsaids in the treatment of scd or
other inflammatory conditions.
