modulation of thyroidal radioiodine uptake by theophylline.  diagnostic and therapeutic use of radioiodine in the management of thyroid disorders depends on the ability of thyroid cells to concentrate radioiodine, a process regulated by  xxxd3368xxx  and dependent on the intracellular increase in camp. we tested the ability of theophylline, a drug known to increase intracellular camp via inhibition of phosphodiesterase, to modulate the thyroidal radioiodine uptake in frtl-5 cells, in mice and in humans. in frtl-5 cells, theophylline increased the uptake of radioactive iodine and intracellular camp only at low concentrations (1 microm). in mice, theophylline increased slightly the radioiodine uptake, although this increase varied from 1.5- to 6.6-fold. in humans, theophylline decreased slightly the radioiodine uptake, a decrease that became more pronounced with time after radioiodine administration. these studies suggest that theophylline modulates the radioiodine uptake in a dose-dependent fashion, although the modulation is mild and probably not applicable to the clinical setting.
