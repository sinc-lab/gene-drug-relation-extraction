 xxxd208xxx  and  xxxd2318xxx  are important precursors for the production of prostaglandins and other hormone-like eicosanoid molecules.
these  xxxd2154xxx  are synthesized by animals by elongating and desaturating precursor  xxxd2154xxx  such as
linoleic acid (18:2d 9,12) and a- xxxd2490xxx  (18:3d 9,12,15).
we have identified a d 5  xxxg2014xxx  gene
(fat-4) from the nematode caenorhabditis elegans. we
have expressed this gene product in saccharomyces
cerevisiae and demonstrate that it readily converts
di-homo-g- xxxd2490xxx  (20:3d 8,11,14) to arachidonic
acid (20:4d 5,8,11,14). the fat-4 d 5-desaturase also acts on
a number of other substrates, including  xxxd2154xxx 
that do not contain a double bond at the d 8 position.

the free-living soil nematode caenorhabditis elegans is capable of synthesizing long chain polyunsaturated  xxxd2154xxx  using simple fatty acid precursors
from its food source, escherichia coli. the d 5  xxxd2154xxx 
 xxxd208xxx  (aa 2, 20:4d 5,8,11,14) and  xxxd2318xxx  (epa, 20:5d 5,8,11,14,17) comprise over 20% of
the total lipids of c. elegans (1, 2). in mammals these
important  xxxd2154xxx  serve structural roles as components of cellular membranes and are also precursors

for the synthesis of prostaglandins and other hormonelike eicosanoid molecules (3). eicosanoids have been
detected in every tissue and fluid in mammals and are
known to mediate processes in reproduction, immunity, neurophysiology, thermobiology, and ion and fluid
transport (4). while eicosanoid molecules have not yet
been examined in c. elegans, they have been found to
play important roles in insects and other invertebrates
(5).
in order to synthesize aa and epa from the saturated and monounsaturated  xxxd2154xxx  available in its
diet, c. elegans must possess a range of desaturation
and elongation activities such that double bonds are
inserted both at positions typical of mammals (d5 and
d6) and at positions typical of plants (d12 and d15) (6,
7). two c. elegans microsomal desaturases have recently been isolated based on sequence similarity to
plant desaturases (8, 9). they both contain conserved
motifs consisting of three histidine-rich sequences (his
boxes) that are believed to be the residues that coordinate the diiron-oxo structure at the active sites (10), as
well as two long stretches (.40 residues each) of hydrophobic residues. the present model proposes that
these hydrophobic domains situate the protein such
that the bulk of the protein is exposed on the cytosolic
face of the endoplasmic reticulum while two membrane-transversing loops (each composed of two membrane-spanning a-helical segments) lock the protein
into the bilayer and situate the his boxes in proper
position in the active site (11, 12). the first c. elegans
desaturase isolated was an v 3-desaturase capable of
inserting a double bond three carbons from the methyl
group of a fatty acid on a glycerolipid (8). the activity
of this enzyme was determined by heterologous expression of a cdna encoding the c. elegans fat-1 gene in the
plant arabidopsis. the fat-1 desaturase is capable of
inserting v 3 double bonds into both 18-carbon and 20carbon v 6 fatty acid substrates. the second desaturase
inserts a double bond between the sixth and seventh

carbon of a fatty acid (d 6) (9). it was isolated based on
similarity to the higher plant borago officinalis microsomal d 6-desaturase (13) and its activity was demonstrated by heterologous expression in the yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae. both the plant and nematode
d 6-desaturases contain an n-terminal heme binding
domain characteristic of  xxxg1456xxx  5 and three his
boxes, the most c-terminal of which varies from the
consensus hxxhh such that the first histidine residue
is replaced by glutamine.
recently two genes have been identified that encode
enzymes with activities specific to the fifth carbon of
the fatty acid chain (d 5-desaturases). one d 5-desaturase, isolated from the bacterium bacillus subtilis, desaturates the saturated fatty acid (16:0) to produce
16:1d 5 (14). this gene was isolated by complementation of e. coli strains deficient in the synthesis of monounsaturated  xxxd2154xxx . this d 5-desaturation reaction
is part of the cold-shock response of b. subtilis and is
not known to occur in higher animals. another d 5desaturase was recently isolated from mortierella alpina, a fungus capable of synthesizing  xxxd208xxx 
and  xxxd2318xxx  (15). this desaturase was
isolated using reverse transcription and pcr with degenerate primer sequences designed to the conserved
his box residues of microsomal desaturases. heterologous expression in the yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae
demonstrated that the enzyme catalyzes the conversion of di-homo-g- xxxd2490xxx  (20:3d 8,11,14) to  xxxd208xxx  (20:4d 5,8,11,14). the mortierella alpina d 5-desaturase also contains an n-terminal  xxxg1456xxx  5
domain characterized by the conserved hpgg heme
binding sequence and a variant third his box containing a q instead of h for the first residue. these features
are also found in the d 6-desaturases from borage and
c. elegans. despite these similarities, however, the
mortierella alpina d 5-desaturase contains only
20 –22% overall identity to other known desaturases
(15).
during data base searches for his-box containing
desaturase genes in the c. elegans genome, we identified a putative d 6-desaturase gene on cosmid w08d2 of
chromosome iv. this was the same gene shown to
encode the d 6-desaturase (9). we noted a gene immediately upstream of this desaturase, located at the end
of cosmid t13f2, that appeared to encode a similar
desaturase-like protein that also contains an n-terminal  xxxg1456xxx  5 domain and d 6-like third histidine
box (qiehh). in this report we describe the isolation
and characterization of this c. elegans gene, designated fat-4, and show that it encodes a  xxxg2014xxx  which can catalyze the introduction of a double bond at the d 5 position of a range of 18- and 20carbon  xxxd2154xxx .

materials and methods
data base searches. the sanger center c. elegans genomic database was searched using blast (16) with sequences of plant desaturase enzymes, including the b. officinalis d 6-desaturase (genbank
accession no. u79010). two c. elegans polypeptides with the highest
scores were a peptide on cosmid w08d2 (high score 163) and one on
t13f2 (high score 121).
rna isolation and reverse transcription-pcr. to amplify the
coding sequences of the two putative desaturase genes we designed
primers to perform rt-pcr on total rna from mixed stage c.
elegans. the nematodes were grown on agar plates as described (17)
and rna was isolated using the phenol/sds method (18). rt-pcr
was performed using the superscript one-step rt-pcr system
(gibco-brl/life technologies). approximately 1 mg of total rna was
added to a reaction mixture consisting 0.2 mm of each dntp, 1.2 mm
mgso 4, superscript ii rt/taq polymerase mix, and 200 mm of appropriate downstream and upstream primers. the reactions were
incubated at 50° for 30 min, then subject to 35 cycles of pcr amplification. for the t13f2.1 gene we used a 59 primer corresponding to
bases 34339 –34361 of cosmid t13f2, gaattttcaatcctccttgggtc, which are 19 – 42 base pairs upstream of the putative start
codon atg. for the 39 end we used a primer corresponding to the
inverse complement of bases 37075–37095 of t13f2 (ggaacatatcacacgaaacag), which begin 93 base pairs after the putative
stop codon tag and end 20 base pairs upstream of the predicted
polyadenylation signal (aauaaa). we named the resulting cdna
fat-4. for the w08d2.4 gene we designed primers to nucleotides 6-23
of cosmid w08d2, cgccgctcaaccaaaatg, which begins 15
base pairs upstream of the atg. the 39 primers were the inverse
complement of bases 3027–3047, gggaatggaggaagaatgacg,
which begin 70 base pairs downstream of the putative stop codon and
end 20 base pairs upstream of the predicted polyadenylation signal
(aauaaa). we named the resulting cdna fat-3. for the determination of transplicing of specific leader sequences, we used downstream
primers corresponding to the complement of bases 35009 –35028 of
the t13f2 (tctgggatctctggttcttg) for the t13f2.1 gene and
to the complement of bases 1371–1391 of the w08d2 (gaaattcatcgtgctctccgtg) for the w08d2.4 gene. the upstream
pcr primers were either sl1-20 or sl2-20 (19). the c. elegans
homologue of the ribosomal-protein  xxxg1984xxx  was used as an sl1-specific
control and k06h7.3 was used as an sl2-specific control (20). sl120, sl2-20, and control primers were kindly provided by diego a. r.
zorio. rt-pcr products visualized by gel electrophoresis were confirmed by blotting the gel and probing with gene-specific oligonucleotides corresponding to the appropriate gene as previously described
(19).
gene construct for yeast expression. the fat-3 gene was cloned
into the pcr-script vector (stratagene). this construct was then
restricted with xhoi and noti and ligated into the episomal yeast
expression vector pmk195 (21) which was also cut with xhoi and
noti. this plasmid was named pyfat3. rt-pcr amplification using
oligonucleotides that introduced hindiii and bamh1 sites at the 59
and 39 ends, respectively, was used to clone this the fat-4 gene into
the yeast expression vector pyes2 (invitrogen). this plasmid was
named pyfat4.
yeast transformation and growth. the constructs were transformed into saccharomyces cerevisiae strain invsc1 using the s.c.
easycomp transformation kit (invitrogen). expression of the fat-3
gene product was driven by a constitutive promoter and was grown
in uracil deficient medium in the presence of 2% glucose. the yeast
were supplemented by the addition of various  xxxd2154xxx  (nuchek
prep) at a final concentration of 0.2 mm in the presence of 1% tergitol
(type np-40) (sigma). for experiments with the fat-4 peptide, yeast
were grown overnight in uracil deficient media containing 2% galactose, 0.2 mm fatty acid, and 1% np-40. under these conditions the
percentage of these supplemented  xxxd2154xxx , which were incorpo-

acids. for experiments in which 20:1d 11 was used as a substrate, the
1% np-40 was replaced by 5% dmso to achieve better incorporation
of this fatty acid.
fatty acid analysis. yeast total  xxxd2154xxx  were extracted from
pellets composed of 1–2 ml of overnight culture. fatty acid methyl
esters (fames) were prepared following the procedure of (22) and
extracted in hexane. fatty acid 4,4-dimethyloxazoline (dmox) derivatives were prepared from the fames by evaporating the hexane
phase, adding 500 ml of 2-amino-2-methylpropanol, and heating overnight at 180°c (23). after cooling, the dmox derivatives were dissolved
in 4 ml of dichloromethane and washed twice with 1.5 ml of distilled
water. the dichloromethane solution was dried and evaporated under a
stream of nitrogen and the residue was dissolved in hexane for injection. analysis of fames and dmox derivatives by gas chromatography
and mass spectroscopy was conducted using a hewlett packard 6890
series gc-ms equipped with a 30 m 3 0.25 mm hp- xxxd1405xxx  column
operating at an ionization voltage of 70 ev with a scan range of 50 –550
daltons.  xxxd2154xxx  were identified by comparison with retention times
of fame standards (sigma). relative percentages of the  xxxd2154xxx 
were calculated from peak areas. the mass spectrum (m/z, rel. int.) of
the dmox derivatives of common and nonmethylene interrupted fatty
acids was compared to published values (24, 25).

identification and cloning of two  xxxg2014xxx  genes. we identified two high-scoring open reading frames during a search of the c. elegans genomic
dna database with the borage d 6-desaturase protein

sequence. both proteins predicted from these open
reading frames, w08d2.4 and t13f2.1, contain an nterminal sequence resembling  xxxg1456xxx  5, including the characteristic (hpgg) heme binding domain,
and an h3 q substitution in the third histidine box.
we named the w08d2.4 gene fat-3 and the t13f2.1
gene fat-4, since they both appear to encode fatty acid
desaturases. interestingly, the two genes are located
next to each other on overlapping cosmids in the same
59 to 39 orientation, with only 858 nucleotide base pairs
separating the putative polyadenylation signal of the
fat-4 gene and the atg start codon of the fat-3 gene
(fig. 1). this gene organization is reminiscent of operons, in which two or more genes are transcribed under
the control of a single promoter and regulatory region
(26). in c. elegans the polycistronic pre-mrna is converted to monocistronic mrna by cleavage and polyadenylation at the 39 end of the upstream gene and
transplicing to the sl2 sequence at the 59 end of the
downstream gene, with the two mrnas being subsequently independently translated. however, of more
than 30 such operons which have been analyzed, the
distances between the 39 end of the upstream gene and
the 59 end of the downstream gene are generally about
100 base pairs, with a few separated by 300 – 400 base

pairs (26). we tested whether the c. elegans fat-3 and
fat-4 genes were transpliced to either sl1 or sl2 in
order to determine if they might be cotranscribed in a
single operon. we found that the fat-4 gene was
transpliced to sl1, but that the fat-3 gene was not
transpliced to either spliced leader sequence (data not
shown). therefore it is likely that each gene contains
its own 59 promoter and regulatory region.
we cloned both of these genes using rt-pcr. the
fat-4 gene sequence matched the t13f2 genomic sequence exactly. however, the gene product encoded by
our cdna was seven amino acids shorter than predicted by genefinder for t13f2.1 (genbank accession
no. z81122) because the dna sequence encoding
amino acid residues 198 –204 was not present in the
fat-4 cdna. the resulting peptide length is 447 amino
acids instead of the previously predicted 454 amino
acids. the gene product encoded by the fat-3 cdna also
matched the genomic sequence of w08d2.4 (genbank
accession no. z70271) perfectly, however, it was also
shorter than the predicted protein sequence. codons
for amino acid residues 38 – 67 of w08d2.4 are not
present in the cdna. in both cases the gene-prediction
software used in the genomic sequencing project appears to have misidentified some intron dna as coding
sequences. napier and others recently isolated the
same cdna, also 30 amino acids shorter than the product predicted for the w08d2.4 gene, and named it
ced6.1 (9). they demonstrated that it encodes a d 6desaturase that, when expressed in the yeast s. cerevisiae, is able to convert linoleic acid (18:2d 9,12) to g- xxxd2490xxx  (18:3d 6,9,12).
sequence comparisons. the c. elegans fat-3 and
fat-4 proteins, the mortierella alpina d 5-desaturase
(15), and the b. officinalis d 6-desaturase (13) appear to
be proteins of similar structure in that they all contain
an n-terminal  xxxg1456xxx  5 domain (27), three histidine boxes and distinct hydrophobic membrane spanning domains predicted by the tmhmm program from
the center for biological sequence analysis, technical
university of denmark (http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/
tmhmm-1.0/) (data not shown). the predicted structure is consistent with the proposed desaturase structural model (11, 12). despite these similarities, the
overall sequence identity among the four proteins is
quite low. for example, the fat-3 d 6-desaturase and
the borage d 6-desaturase share only 28% identity on
the amino acid level. the fat-4 gene product shares
25% amino acid identity with the borage d 6-desaturase
and 19% amino acid identity with the mortierella alpina d 5-desaturase. indeed the only portion of the
fat-4 protein that shows extended homology to the m.
alpina d 5-desaturase is a sequence of 36 residues incorporating the third his box which has 44% identity
and 56% similarity. the most closely related pair of

sequences are fat-3 and fat-4, which are 46% identical
on the amino acid level and 54% identical over the
entire cdna sequence. figure 2 shows the sequence
comparison of the borage d 6-desaturase, c. elegans
fat-3, c. elegans fat-4, and the mortierella alpina
d 5-desaturase. the similar heme binding domains
(hpgg) and the three histidine box regions are underlined. the presence of these conserved motifs predict
that the fat-4 gene may encode a desaturase or a related fatty acid modifying enzyme (10); however, it is
not possible to predict whether this gene encodes a
d 6-desaturase, a d 5-desaturase, or a more distantly
related enzyme.
 xxxg2014xxx  activity and substrate specificity in yeast. to determine the enzymatic activity of
the fat-4 desaturase-like protein, we expressed it in
s. cerevisiae supplemented with polyunsaturated fatty
acid substrates that are not normally present in this
yeast. we expressed the fat-4 protein in the yeast
expression vector pyes2 from the  xxxg853xxx   xxxg1321xxx  promoter by
growing the cells in the presence of galactose and various  xxxd2154xxx . after 16 h of growth, the cells were
analyzed for total fatty acid composition by gas chromatography (gc). comparison of cells supplemented
with di-homo-g- xxxd2490xxx  (20:3d 8,11,14) carrying
pyes2 containing the fat-4 coding sequence and cells
carrying the vector alone reveals the presence of a
major new peak eluting at 14.49 min in the cells expressing fat-4 (fig. 3). the novel peak had a retention
time identical to that of the authentic  xxxd208xxx 
methyl ester (20:4d 5,8,11,14), and was determined to be
 xxxd208xxx  (20:4d 5,8,11,14) because its mass spectrum was identical to that of authentic arachidonic
acid methyl ester, including a mass ion peak at m/z
318. the identity of this compound was further verified
by converting the yeast fatty acid methyl esters into
oxazoline derivatives in order to produce structure specific mass spectra which simplify the determination of
double-bond positions in a hydrocarbon chain (24). the
mass spectrum of the dmox derivative of the novel
20:4 component was consistent with the published
spectrum for aa (24) and contained a prominent peak
at m/z 153, which is diagnostic of a double bond at the
d 5 position. therefore, the fat-4 gene encodes a d 5desaturase capable of synthesizing  xxxd208xxx 
from the substrate di-homo-g- xxxd2490xxx . in contrast, the fat-4 protein showed no activity when linoleic acid (18:2d 9,12) or a- xxxd2490xxx  (18:3d 9,12,15) were
provided as substrates, indicating an absence of d 6desaturase activity.
further analysis of the gc trace of the total fatty
acids of the yeast cells expressing fat-4 revealed the
presence of a second novel peak eluting at 12.91 min,
which is not present in the empty vector control cells.

veals a molecular ion species of 294, identical to that of
a methyl ester of an 18-carbon fatty acid with two
double bonds (18:2), but its retention time and mass
spectrum are not identical to the common isomer 18:2
d 9,12. in microsomal extracts of mammalian liver d 5desaturase activity has been reported to act on a number of 18 and 20-carbon precursors to produce uncommon  xxxd2154xxx  such as 18:2d 5,11, 20:3d 5,11,14, and 20:
4d 5,11,14,17 (28, 29). two species of slime molds have also
been reported to produce small amounts of 18:2d 5,9,
18:2d 5,11, 20:3d 5,11,14, and 20:4d 5,11,14,17 (25). these fatty
acids are unusual in that their double bonds do not
follow the conventional methylene-interrupted pattern
(one double bond every three carbons). therefore, we
suspected our novel peak is a result of the c. elegans
d 5-desaturase acting on 18:1d 9 [or 18:1d 11, which in s.
cerevisiae constitutes 15–20% of the total 18:1 (30)], to
produce the uncommon isomer 18:2d 5,9 or 18:2d 5,11. we
converted these yeast fatty acid methyl esters into
oxazoline derivatives and found that the mass spectrum of the dmox derivative of the novel 18:2 component contained the d 5 specific peak at m/z 153; however, the larger ion peaks characteristic of double

bonds at the d 9 or d 11 position were not present due to
the small amount of this molecule present in the total
yeast extracts.
to test if the c. elegans d 5-desaturase was capable of
desaturating other substrates to produce other uncommon, nonmethylene interrupted  xxxd2154xxx , we supplemented the yeast expressing the fat-4-desaturase
with unconventional d 5-substrates such as 20:1d 11, 20:
2d 11,14, and 20:3d 11,14,17. we were unable to detect any
novel peaks when the substrate 20:1d 11 was fed to
yeast; however, when 20:2d 11,14 and 20:3d 11,14,17 were
provided as substrates we detected novel peaks eluting
at 14.62 and 14.69 min, respectively (fig. 4). the mass
spectra analysis of dmox derivatives of these molecules is consistent with published values for 20:3d 5,11,14
and 20:4d 5,11,14,17 (25), including a prominent ion peak of
m/z 153, which is diagnostic of double bonds at the d 5
position (24). we found, however, that these  xxxd2154xxx 
were not produced to the same extent as arachidonic
acid (20:4d 5,8,11,14) (table i). in our experiment, 55% of
exogenously fed di-homo-g- xxxd2490xxx  (20:3d 8,11,14) is
converted to  xxxd208xxx , while only 5, 27, and

26% of the 18:1, 20:2d 11,14, and 20:3d 11,14,17 substrates
are converted (table i).
we expressed the fat-3 gene in the yeast expression
vector pmk195 containing the constitutive adh promoter. we determined that the fat-3 protein was able
to desaturate linoleic acid (18:2d 9,12) into g-linolenic
acid (18:3d 6,9,12), in agreement with published results
(9). we also found that it was capable of desaturating
a- xxxd2490xxx  (18:3d 9,12,15) to 18:4d 6,9,12,15, a common
reaction in animals (6, 31). the fat-3 protein showed
no activity on 20:1d 11, 20:2d 11,14, 20:3d 8,11,14, or
20:3d 11,14,17 (table i). therefore, the substrate specificities of the c. elegans d 5- and d 6-desaturases are specific and nonoverlapping.

when overexpressed in the yeast s. cerevisiae, the c.
elegans d 6-desaturase (fat-3) specifically acts on two
18-carbon substrates, linoleic and a- xxxd2490xxx , and
always desaturates in a methylene interrupted pattern
(one double bond every three carbons). the mammalian d 6-desaturase system has likewise been demonstrated to insert double bonds strictly in a methylene
interrupted pattern and to have no activity on 20 carbon substrates (29). the c. elegans d 5-desaturase
(fat-4), in contrast, acts on a number of 20 carbon
substrates, as well as on an endogenous 18:1 of yeast,
and is capable of inserting double bonds in a nonmethylene interrupted pattern. nonmethylene interrupted
 xxxd2154xxx  such as 20:2d 5,11, 20:3d 5,11,14, 18:2d 5,11 have
been detected in mammalian cells by feeding 14c labeled substrates to rats raised on a fat-deficient diet
(28, 29). however, these  xxxd2154xxx  are considered to be
“dead end” metabolites, as they have not been demonstrated to serve as precursors to signaling molecules
such as prostaglandins (32), nor are they detectable in
tissue lipids of rats who are not preconditioned on a
fat-deficient diet (28). we have also failed to detect
these  xxxd2154xxx  in c. elegans lipid extracts.
in yeast expressing the c. elegans d 5-desaturase
gene, the amount of substrate converted is greatest for
the metabolically significant substrate 20:3d 8,11,14 (table i). in our experiment, the amount of 20:2d 11,14 and
20:3d 11,14,17 desaturated was less than half of the
amount of conventional substrate that was desaturated. this is consistent with the rates of desaturation
in microsomal extracts of mammalian liver, where the
rate of conversion of labeled 20:2d 11,14 to 20:3d 5,11,14 is
41% of the rate of conversion of labeled 20:3d 8,11,14 to
20:4d 5,8,11,14 (33).
the c. elegans fat-3 and fat-4 genes are present in a
gene cluster in the same 59 to 39 orientation, yet, unlike
other gene clusters of this sort in c. elegans, the downstream fat-3 gene is not transpliced to sl2, and therefore
is unlikely to be cotranscribed with the upstream fat-4
table i

discussion

in this paper we describe a region of the c. elegans
genome located at position 3.1 of chromosome iv which
contains the d 5- and d 6-desaturase genes. the amino
acid sequences encoded by the two genes are 46% identical to each other, and each contains an n-terminal
heme binding domain typical of the electron carrier
 xxxg1456xxx  5 and three histidine boxes. both genes
contain the consensus sequence of the third his box
(qxxhh) that has so far been shown to be unique to
the microsomal desaturases involved in double bond
insertion at carbons below position 9. despite these
similarities, these two microsomal desaturases show
absolutely nonoverlapping substrate specificities.

gene. the two genes could be located next to each other as
a result of an ancient gene duplication event. the dna
sequences share 54% identity over the entirecdna coding sequence; however, only the final two intron/exon
boundaries are common between the genes (fig. 1).
this is the first reported sequence of a d 5 desaturase
gene from an animal. the sequence of the c. elegans
d 5-desaturase is quite distant from the bacterial and
fungal d 5-desaturases which have been reported and
this animal sequence should facilitate the search for
desaturase encoding sequences from humans and
other mammals. both the d 5- and d 6-desaturases are
important regulatory enzymes in humans (34). they
participate in critical steps in the pathway to produce
precursors for synthesis of hormone-like eicosanoid
molecules from the essential dietary  xxxd2154xxx , linoleic acid and a- xxxd2490xxx . the activities of these
desaturases have been shown to be under hormonal
and nutritional control (34), but the mechanism of this
control is still unknown. certain diseases, such as diabetes (35), result in low d 5-desaturase activity, while
htc cells, isolated from an ascites tumor derived from
a solid hepatoma, show increased d 5-desaturase activity (36). future studies of the c. elegans d 5- and d 6desaturases will provide insight into the regulation of
these desaturases in this animal model system. the
availability of mutational and reverse genetic tools and
the expanding knowledge of cellular and developmental biology in c. elegans make this an attractive system
to study the roles of polyunsaturated  xxxd2154xxx  and
their metabolic products in development, reproduction,
and other cellular processes of animals.
