 xxxd2611xxx  (mdma, "ecstasy") induces fenfluramine-like proliferative actions on human cardiac valvular interstitial cells in...  recent findings have implicated the 5-hydroxytryptamine 2b (5-ht2b)  xxxg1114xxx  in mediating the heart valve fibroplasia [valvular heart disease (vhd)] and primary pulmonary hypertension observed in patients taking the now-banned appetite suppressant fenfluramine (pondimin, redux). via large-scale, random screening of a portion of the receptorome, we have discovered that the amphetamine derivative  xxxd2611xxx  (mdma, "ecstasy") and its n-demethylated metabolite 3,4-methylenedioxyamphetamine (mda) each preferentially bind to and activate human recombinant 5-ht2b receptors. we also demonstrate that mdma and mda, like fenfluramine and its n-deethylated metabolite norfenfluramine, elicit prolonged mitogenic responses in human valvular interstitial cells via activation of 5-ht2b receptors. we also report that pergolide and dihydroergotamine, two drugs recently demonstrated to induce vhd in humans, potently activate 5-ht2b receptors, thus validating this assay system for its ability to predict medications that might induce vhd. our discovery that mdma and a major metabolite, mda, induce prolonged mitogenic responses in vitro similar to those induced by fenfluramine and norfenfluramine in vivo (i.e., valvular interstitial cell fibroplasia) predict that long-term mdma use could lead to the development of fenfluramine-like vhd. because of the widespread abuse of mdma, these findings have major public health implications. these findings also underscore the necessity of screening current and future drugs at h5-ht2b receptors for agonist actions before their use in humans.
