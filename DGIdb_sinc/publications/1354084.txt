summary
1. the role of the presynaptic adrenoceptor subtypes in man was investigated based on
observation of the changes in blood pressure (abp) and plasma noradrenaline concentration (ana)
with the cold pressor test (cpt).
2. the cpt was well reproducible for bp and na when performed at a 2 week interval in
patients with mild hypertension.
3. after administration for 4 weeks, guanfacine (gf; a*-adrenoceptor agonist) decreased the
ana response to cpt.
4. after administration for 2 or 4 weeks, bunazosin (bu; a,-adrenoceptor antagonist) atenolol
(at; pi-adrenoceptor antagonist) and  xxxd2689xxx  (nd; non-selective p-adrenoceptor antagonist) did not
affect the ana response to cpt.
5. both gf and bu decreased the systolic blood pressure response (asbp) to cpt after 4 weeks
of the administration. neither at nor nd significantly changed the asbp response to cpt.
6 . it is likely that gf stimulated the presynaptic (yz adrenoceptors at the sympathetic nerve
endings as well as the central a2 adrenoceptors, inhibiting the release of noradrenaline. it is unlikely
that bu, at and nd exerted any clearly defined action on the presynaptic adrenoceptors in human
hypertensive subjects.
key words: antihypertensive drug, cold pressor test, plasma noradrenaline.

introduction
adrenoceptor subtypes, such as a ~ (yz,
, pi and pz,
have been characterized at sympathetic nerve endings.
in vitro studies have demonstrated that presynaptic
( y i - and az-adrenoceptors inhibit stimulation-induced
noradrenaline release (langer 1981; hicks et al. 1986;
murphy et al. 1989), while 01-and &-adrenoceptors
enhance stimulation-induced release of noradrenaline
(stjarne & brundin 1976; langer 1981; ueda et al.

1985). however, presynaptic lyi-, pi- and pa-adrenoceptors have not been shown to have a primary role in
modulating noradrenaline (na) reiease from sympathetic nerve endings, while presynaptic apadrenoceptors have been shown, in vivo, to play a crucial
role in regulating na release (stevens et a f . 1982;
steenberg et al. 1983; uchida et al. 1984). in humans,
however, it is still unclear to what extent the pre-

synaptic adrenoceptors participate in regulating na
release from the sympathetic nerve endings.
the present study was designed to clarify the role of
presynaptic adrenoceptor subtypes in modulating the
release of na from sympathetic nerve endings in
patients with mild essential hypertension. na release
was measured with an attempt to stimulate the sympathetic nervous system (i.e. by means of the cold
pressor test).

methods
all subjects gave informed consent to enter the following studies.

reproducibility of the cold pressor test
the cold pressor test (cpt) was performed twice at
intervals of 2 weeks in patients with mild essential
hypertension in order to investigateits reproducibility.
mild essential hypertension was defined as diastolic
blood pressure in the sitting position of between 90
and 104 mmhg on at least three blood pressure
readings obtained at 2 week intervals (table 1).

measurements and cpt were performed on the day
before, 2 weeks and 4 weeks after the start of the
administration of drugs.

procedures for cpt
the patient lay quietly in the supine position, and a 19
gauge needle composing an arm of three-way needle
set was inserted into an antecubital vein. the point of
time at which the instrumentations were completed
was defined as 0 min, and physiological saline was
then infused at a low volume through the needle.
after 30 min, cpt was performed by immersing one
of the subject's hands into 4oc iced water for precisely
1 min.

measurements of plasma catecholamine
concentration and blood pressure
blood samples (7 ml each) were obtained, within
10-15 s, at the points of time shown in the time
schedule (fig. 1). plasma na and adrenaline (a)
concentrations were measured by means of high performance liquid chromatography (shimadzu, japan;
lc-6a, zorvax scx-300, rf-5oolca) coupled with
the trihydroxy indole method. blood pressure and

the administration of antihypertensive drugs
half a milligram of an az-agonist, guanfacine (sorkin
& heel 1986), was administered at bedtime to the first
group of 10 subjects. the second group of 10 subjects

received an a,-antagonist, bunazosin (suzuki et al.
1987), at a dose of 0.5 mg t.i.d. fifty milligrams of a
&antagonist, atenolol (frishman & teicher 1985),
was administered once a day in the morning to the
third group of 10 subjects. the fourth group of 10
subjects received 30 mg of the non-selective b-adrenoceptor antagonist,  xxxd2689xxx  (frishman & teicher 1985),
once a day in the morning. all subjects had mild
essential hypertension. there were no differences in
age or systolic and diastolic blood pressure between
the four medication groups (table 1). blood pressure

outpatient clinic before the first cold pressor test. *data are expressed as mean fs.e.m. tdata are expressed as mean f s.e.m.

antihypertensive drugs and catecholamines
pulse rate were measured at 1 min intervals with an
automatic sphygmomanometer (bp-203; nippon
colin, japan) in the contralateral arm throughout the
experiment. the values of plasma ca concentration,
blood pressure and pulse rate at time point prior to
the cpt (point 3, fig. 1) were taken to be the values
before cpt, and the highest later value (points 4 or 5 ,
fig. 1) as the value after cpt. the differences in
plasma ca concentration, blood pressure and pulse
rate before and after the cpt were attributed to cpt.
in the laboratory, 2 ml of the human plasma was
divided into halves and 1 ng of standard na and 1 ng
of standard a (sigma, st louis, mo, usa; na; a7256; a, e-4375)was added into one of the samples.
the differences in na and a between the plasma with
standard na and a and the plasma without were
measured. the values of the differences obtained
from 20 normal subjects were 1.018+0.067 ng/ml
(mean fs.e.m.) for na and 0.985 f0.062 ng/ ml for
a (ishimura et al. 1988).
blood pressures were measured in the outpatient
clinic using a mercury sphygmomanometer.

statistical analysis
all the values obtained are expressed as mean fs.e.m.
lntra-individual comparisons were performed for reproducibility by linear regression analysis. significant
differences between three groups were analysed by
one-way analysis of variance. significant differences
between more than three groups of variables in one
and the same patients were assessed by two-way

483

analysis of variance with repeated measures followed
by the bonferroni method. p values less than 0.05
were considered to be statistically significant.

results
reproducibility of cpt
table 2 shows the haemodynamic parameters and
plasma ca concentrations before and following the
cpt that was performed at a 2 week interval in
patients with mild hypertension. there was a good
correlation between the first and the second measurements of systolic blood pressure (sbp), diastolic blood
pressure (dbp), na and a.

changes in blood pressure and pulse rate
produced by antihypertensive drugs
figure 2 shows the time course changes in blood
pressure and pulse rate (pr) measured before and
after the start of the administration of the antihypertensive drugs. measurements were made at 2 week
intervals, starting 4 weeks before ( - 4 weeks) and
continuing until the end of 4 weeks after the start of
the administration of the antihypertensive drugs. as
compared with the control values (0 week), the pblockers atenolol (at) and nadalol (nd) decreased p r
significantly, but bunazosin (bu) and guanfacine (gf)
did not. systolic blood pressure and dbp were decreased by all drugs to the same extent (i.e. per cent

figure 3 shows the response of haemodynamic parameters and plasma ca concentrations to cpt. the
incremental changes due to cpt (e?i) are also shown.
the cpt was performed on the day before, and both
2 weeks and 4 weeks after the start of the administration of gf. after the start of gf therapy, both
sbp(135.1f3.2mmhg)and dbp(82.8f3.7mmhg)

4 weeks after the start of the treatment (sbp, 122.6 f
3.6 mmhg; dbp, 75.5 f 3.2 mmhg; asbp, 24.0 f 3.2
to 12.8 f 1.9 mmhg). however, there was no significant change in pr at rest and apr due to the cpt.
guanfacine significantly decreased the level of plasma
na (0.329k0.059 to 0.156f0.014 ng/ml) by the
end of 4 weeks. however, gf hardly altered the
plasma a level. the time course changes in ana were
similar to those for asbp, with ana significantly
decreasing (0.097 f0.024 to 0.032 f 0.007 ngl ml) by
the end of 4 weeks.

bunazosin group
the sbp at rest (137.2 f5.1 mmhg) decreased significantlyafter2(131.5*5.4mmhg) and4(132.3*5.9
mmhg) weeks of the treatment (fig. 4). however, bu
administration resulted in little change of either pr
and dbp at rest. the asbp in response to cpt
decreased significantly (13.8 f 1.6 to 5.7 f 1.0 mmhg)
after 4 weeks of the administration of bu as compared
with the day before bu. bunazosin did not affect apr
or adbp. it also did not change plasma na and a
concentrations at rest or ana and aa responses to
cpt.
atenoioi group
the resting values of pr (71.7 f2.8 beats/min), sbp
(129.4f3.6 mmhg) and dbp (72.9f2.2 mmhg)
decreased significantly 2 weeks (60.2 f2.0 beats/ min,
115.3 f 5.5 mmhg and 63.9 f 3.5 mmhg, respectively)
and 4 weeks (60.0 f 2.0 beats/ min, 115.7f4.3 mmhg
and 65.1 f 2.6 mmhg, respectively) after the start of
at administration (fig. 5). there were no significant
time course changes in apr, asbp and adbp responses to cpt. however, at increased plasma na

reproducibility of cpt
several reports have suggested that cpt has good
reproducibility in terms of blood pressure response
(hines & brown 1933; pickering & kissin 1936).
however, the reproducibility of changes in plasma
ca concentration response to cpt has not been clear
(cuddy et al. 1966; niki 1986). in the present study,

was examined by performing the challenge at intervals
of 2 weeks in patients with mild hypertension. the
reproducibility of the changes in blood pressures and
plasma ca concentrations was quite good (table 2).
it is generally believed that the nerve stimulus of cpt
origin ascends in the spinothalamic tract as a pain
sensation and reaches the thalamus and subsequently
the vasomotor centre in the medulla oblongata. this
event results in na release from the sympathetic
nerve endings (hines & brown 1932; wolf & hardy
1941; eliasson et al. 1983). in the present study, cpt
was thought to be at least a semiquantitative method
to stimulate the sympathetic nervous system. this
appears to be a reasonable hypothesis, partly in view
of the well reproducible fact that cpt elevated the
plasma na concentration.

roles of presynaptic adrenoceptors assessed by
means of cpt before and after the
antihypertensiveregimens
following the administration of a2-agonist, both asbp
and ana became smaller in response to cpt both 2
and 4 weeks after the start of drug administration.
the decrease was significant by the fourth week (fig.
3). this result suggests that gf administration leads to
the stimulation of a 2 adrenoceptors at the sympathetic
nerve endings and/or in the central nervous system
which, in turn, results in inhibition of na release
from the sympathetic nerve endings. this chain of
events would inhibit the adrenergic response to cold
stimuli, provided that a cold stimulus results in increasing sympathetic nerve impulses from the central
nervous system, with consequent na release from the
sympathetic nerve endings. guanfacine is reported to
lower blood pressure via the stimulation of central
and/ or peripheral presynaptic a2-adrenoceptors in
humans (brown et al. 1985; sorkin & heel 1986). it
has also been reported that gf reduced na release in
response to adrenergic nerve stimulation in the isolated
heart of the rabbits (pacha et al. 1975), so it might be
possible that the observed gf-mediated inhibition of
plasma na concentration increase in response to
cpt is actually mediated at least in part via presynaptic a2-adrenoceptors at the sympathetic nerve
endings.
the al-adrenoceptor antagonist, bunazosin, did not
affect the ana response to cpt (fig. 4). this suggests that presynaptic al-adrenoceptors at the sympathetic nerve endings in hypertensive patients are
not playing any important role in the facilitation or
inhibition of na release. however, asbp was decreased significantly after the start of the admini-

487

stration of bu for 4 weeks (fig. 4). this decrease in
asbp is thought to be due to the blockade of a ~ adrenoceptors in the systemic resistance vessels.
both at and nd did not affect the increase in blood
pressure due to cpt (figs 5, 6). although this actual
mechanism is unknown, it may be due to the mechanism that the negative inotropic effect of p-blockers
counteracted the enhancing pressor response due to
unopposed a-adrenoceptor-mediated vaso-constriction
after the treatment with p-blockers.
both at and nd elevated plasma na concentration
at rest (figs 5 , 6). this may be due to mechanisms
previously reported (eckberg et al. 1976; rand et al.
1976; weinstock 1976; cryer et al. 1980; sugawara et
al. 1980; esler et al. 1981). judging from the data that
the two p-blockers elevated plasma na levels at rest
without significantly altering the blood pressure response or na response to the cpt, it is suggested
that a reduction in non-neuronal clearance is the most
likely mechanism for the elevation of plasma na
levels.
both at and nd did not affect the ana in response
to cpt (figs 5, 6). ana due to cpt would not have
been affected by na clearance since cpt continues
for only 1 min. these observations support the hypothesis that the presynaptic pi- and 82-adrenoceptors
d o not play any important role in the facilitation or
inhibition of na release in humans.
of all the adrenoceptor subtypes present at the
sympathetic nerve endings, it is hypothesized that
only the az-adrenoceptors play a physiologically important role in modulating the release of na from
sympathetic nerve endings in this situation, although
all the drugs used decreased basal blood pressure.
