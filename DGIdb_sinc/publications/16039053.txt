abstract
recent studies on prostanoids showed that some of prostanoid receptors are expressed in rat dorsal root ganglion (drg) neurons. these
facts suggest that prostanoid receptors might be involved in the excitation mechanism of drg neurons. in the present study, pcr experiments
revealed that one of prostanoid receptor,  xxxg1879xxx  ( xxxg1879xxx ) was expressed in l6 and s1 rat drg neurons and that the
expression of  xxxg1879xxx  was not changed in drg neurons obtained from the cyclophosphamide (cyp)-induced cystitis rat. we examined the
functional role of  xxxg1879xxx  agonist and other prostanoids by measuring  xxxd1773xxx  (camp) accumulation and  xxxg2240xxx  (sp) release in
primary cultured drg neurons. the pretreatment of drg neurons with prostanoid agonists such as  xxxd2331xxx  (ip), butaprost ( xxxg1873xxx  ),  xxxd2653xxx 
( xxxg1873xxx –4 ), pge2 (ep1–4 ) or  xxxg1073xxx  (dp and  xxxg1871xxx ) sensitized the drg neurons and hence potentiated the lys-bradykinin-induced sp release.
the increase of sp release by lys-bk plus prostanoid agonists was proportion to camp accumulation.  xxxd2331xxx  was the most potent agonist
to induce camp accumulation and sp release among prostanoid agonists evaluated in this study and its effect is mediated by  xxxg1879xxx .
moreover, capsaicin-, atp- and kcl-induced sp release was also enhanced by  xxxd2331xxx  although  xxxd2331xxx  did not change intracellular ca2+
and membrane depolarization induced by these chemical stimuli. these results strongly indicate that  xxxg1879xxx  play an important role in the
sensitization of rat sensory neuron.

bioactive lipid mediators, prostaglandins (pgs) are a diverse
family of autocoids, which are generated from both neuronal and non-neuronal cell membrane phospholipids. the
pgs are known to sensitize mechanoreceptors and chemoreceptors and their synthesis is increased in a range of diseases including inflammation [5,20]. in the urinary bladder,
prostaglandins are generated locally in response to physiologic stimuli such as stretch of the detrusor smooth muscle
or pathophysiologic stimuli such as injuries of the vesical mucosa and nerve stimulation [3]. though several pgs
like  xxxd1903xxx  , prostaglandin f2␣ , thromboxan a2 are
known to release from bladder of different animal species but

prostaglandin i2 (pgi2 ) is the most likely major prostaglandin
released from human bladder [3,11].
interstitial cystitis (ic), a known inflammatory bladder
disorders is associated with urgency, frequent urination and
pain [17]. these symptoms are caused by abnormal neuronal
activity of unmyelinated sensory afferent [21,26]. substance
p functions as a nociceptive neurotransmitter in the central
and peripheral nervous system. the evidence like increased
urinary excretion of  xxxg2240xxx  as well as increased number
of sp containing nerves in the bladder of ic patients strongly
suggest the role of neurogenic inflammation in this condition.
the release of excitatory neuropeptide  xxxg2240xxx  is induced
by capsaicin, bradykinin (bk), atp and other stimulus agents
[16,23] and their excitatory effects were enhanced by the activation of protein kinase c (pkc) and  xxxg1836xxx  (pka)
[2,13]. inflammatory mediator pgs like pge2 also sensitizes sensory neurons and further enhance the bk-induced

 xxxg2240xxx  release from primary cultures of dorsal root ganglion (drg) neurons via camp-pka transduction pathway
[14,23]. another prostaglandins, pgi2 also induced camp
accumulation [22] and sensitized sensory neuron [18] and
evoked hyperalgesia [24] suggests its role in neurogenic
inflammation.
pge2 and pgi2 are known to activate second messengers via specific g-protein coupled receptors (gpcr) [5]. at
least, four pge2 receptor isoforms have been cloned as ep1 ,
 xxxg1873xxx  ,  xxxg1874xxx  and  xxxg1875xxx  , and one  xxxg1879xxx  have been cloned
as  xxxg1879xxx  ( xxxg1879xxx ). ep1 is gq g-protein
coupled receptor.  xxxg1873xxx  ,  xxxg1875xxx  and  xxxg1879xxx  are gs g-protein
coupled receptor and mediate adenylyl cyclase activation and
 xxxg1874xxx  is a multiple  xxxg89xxx , which shows
different properties in various tissues or cells [5]. pge2 and
pgi2 bind to these receptors expressed in sensory neuron.
the mechanisms accounting for the drg neurons sensitization for pge2 has been studied earlier [23] however,
the same for pgi2 is not understood yet. in this study, we
examined  xxxg1879xxx  expression profiling of sensory neuron
and bladder in rats and the role of  xxxg1879xxx  on sensory
neuron.
for expression profiling study, cyclophosphamide (sigma,
st. louis, mo; 100 mg/kg body weight) was administered
intraperitoneally to induce cystitis in adult female sd rats
(n = 3). rats were sacrificed 24 h later and drg and urinary bladder were dissected. the cystitis, which increased
the bladder weight, was confirmed by weighing the bladder. the protocol to handle the animals was approved by
the animal care and use committee, bayer yakuhin ltd.,
research center kyoto. total cellular rna was isolated
from l6 and s1 drg and bladder of cyclophosphamide
or saline-administered rats and purified by an acid guanidium thiocyanate–phenol–chloroform method using sepazol rna i (nacalai tesque, kyoto, japan) as an extraction reagent [6]. the rna (1.0 ␮g) was reverse-transcribed
with superscript ii reverse transcriptase in the presence
of random hexamers and oligo (dt) primer (invitrogen,
carlsbad, ca). pcr analysis was carried out in 20 ␮l
volumes containing 20 ng of cdna as a template and
0.75 ␮m of each primer using hot star taq master kit (qiagen, valenica, ca). rat  xxxg1879xxx  primers sequences
were 5 -tgctgtgtgacactttcgccttcg-3 and 5 gtgccgtctctgttggcggtacat-3 . pcr condition
was as follows. samples were preheated at 95 ◦ c for 15 min
and then subjected to denaturing conditions at 94 ◦ c for 10 s.
after annealing at 63 ◦ c for 30 s, genes were amplified at
72 ◦ c for 30 s (30 cycles). the quantitative analysis was performed with commercially available kit (light cycler-dna
master sybr green i and light cycler quantitative pcr system; roche molecular biochemicals, mannheim, germany).
the pcr amplification was repeated 45 times at 95 ◦ c for
0 s, at 68 ◦ c for 5 s, and at 72 ◦ c for 25 s.
the culture of primary drg neurons was prepared
from newborn rats (sd strain). dispersed single cells were
obtained with mechanical dissociation in 1 mg/ml collage-

133

nase a solution (hanks  xxxd2988xxx  buffer ph 7.4)
for 60 min at 37 ◦ c. drg neurons were cultured for 3 days
in ham’s f-12 medium (gibco brl, paisley, scotland,
u.k.) including 80 ng/ml  xxxg1564xxx  (sigma, st.
louis, mo), 0.1 mm 5-fluorouracil (sigma, st. louis, mo),
7.5 mg/ml l- xxxd228xxx  and 10% fcs in collagen type i
pre-coated 96-well plate (becton dickinson, san jose, ca).
for camp assay, the cells were washed with the camp
assay buffer (hank’s  xxxd2988xxx , 17 mm hepes,
0.1% bsa, 250 ␮m  xxxd2388xxx  ( xxxd2388xxx ),
1 mm sodium ascorbate, ph 7.4) and then incubated for
30 min at 37 ◦ c with 80 nm  xxxd2331xxx . the accumulated camp
in the cells was measured by enzyme immuno assay (eia)
kit (tropix, bedford, ma).
for  xxxg2240xxx  release assay, drg neurons were washed
with the sp assay buffer (hank’s  xxxd2988xxx ,
17 mm hepes, 0.1% bsa, ph 7.4). prostanoid agonists
were treated for 10 min at 25 ◦ c. sp release induced by lysbradykinin (peptide institute inc., osaka, japan), capsaicin,
atp and kcl for 30 min at 37 ◦ c into the assay buffer was
quantified by eia (cayman chemical, ann arbor, mi).
ca2+ mobilization assay was performed with ca2+ specific fluorescent indicator. ca2+ loading buffer was prepared
by mixing 1 ␮m of fluo-3am (molecular probes, eugene,
or) and 0.01% pluronic f-127 (molecular probes, eugene,
or) in the ca2+ assay buffer (hank’s  xxxd2988xxx ,
17 mm hepes ph 7.4, 0.1% bsa, 1 mm probenecid). drg
neurons were incubated with ca2+ loading buffer for 60 min
at 37 ◦ c. the emitted 480 nm fluorescence induced by stimuli
was measured by fdss6000 fluorimeter (hamamatsu photonics, hamamatsu, japan).
the fluorescent probe sensing depolarization was used for
membrane potential. drg neurons were incubated with the
membrane potential assay buffer (hank’s  xxxd2988xxx , 17 mm hepes, 0.1% bsa, flipr membrane potential
assay kit reagent (molecular devices, sunnyvale, ca; ph
7.4) for 30 min at 37 ◦ c. the emitted 480 nm fluorescence
induced by stimuli was measured by fdss6000 fluorimeter
(hamamatsu photonics, hamamatsu, japan).
 xxxd2331xxx  was purchased from amersham pharmacia
biotech (buckinghamshire, uk) and pge2 , butaprost and
 xxxd2653xxx  were purchased from cayman chemical (ann
arbor, mi).
the pcr analysis confirmed  xxxg1879xxx  expression in
l6-s1 drg neurons but not in bladder (fig. 1a). cyclophosphamide (cyp) is known to induce cystitis accompanying severe inflammatory alterations in neurochemical and
organizational properties [12]. we, therefore, examined the
 xxxg1879xxx  expression level in bladder and l6-s1 drg
neurons of cyp-induced cystitis rats, by a quantitative
reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analysis. the
expression level of  xxxg1879xxx  in l6-s1 drg neuron was
not changed in cyp-administrated cystitis rats as compared
to saline treated rats (fig. 1b). also no significant expression of  xxxg1879xxx  was detected in the bladder from cypadministered rats.

amplified by rt-pcr (30 cycles) using equal amounts of total rna from each tissue. a house keeping gene, ␤-actin, was also amplified from the same sample
as a control. (b) quantitative rt-pcr for ip receptors in rat l6-s1 drg neurons and bladder from saline- or cyp-administrated. all pcr reactions were
controlled by  xxxg861xxx  expression and the relative value for each test sample was determined with the light cycler. l6-s1 drg neurons of three rats were
brought together into one sample. l6-s1 drg neurons data represent mean. bladder data represents mean ± s.d.

the functional role of  xxxg1879xxx  and other prostanoid
receptors were examined by measuring the effect of  xxxd2331xxx 
(ip agonist), pge2 , butaprost ( xxxg1873xxx  agonist),  xxxd2653xxx 
( xxxg1873xxx  ,  xxxg1874xxx  and  xxxg1875xxx  agonist), and  xxxg1073xxx  on camp level in
primary cultured drg neurons. as shown in fig. 2a,  xxxd2331xxx  was the most potent agonist to accumulate camp. high
concentration (1–10 ␮m) of pge2 , butaprost and  xxxd2653xxx  induced some camp accumulation indicating their weak
effect.
increased camp levels in drg neurons are expected to
sensitize the neuronal tissue and hence may increase the
neurotransmitter release. therefore, the sensitizing effect of
prostanoid agonists was examined by measuring sp release
from drg neurons induced by lys-bradykinin. plasma
kinins, bradykinin and lys-bradykinin (kallidin) are abundant in urine and their responses are caused via  xxxg11xxx   xxxg258xxx 
expressed in drg neurons [8]. drg neurons in the presence
of 1 nm lys-bradykinin release sp, which was in the range of

4.1–6.2 pg/ml/well. the pretreatment of prostanoid agonists
concentration dependently potentiated the lys-bradykinininduced sp release (fig. 2b). the  xxxd2331xxx  was the most potent
agonist. the other prostanoid agonists also sensitized the
drg neurons to lys-bradykinin induced  xxxg2240xxx  release,
however, the potentiating effect was much less than that of
 xxxd2331xxx .
 xxxd2331xxx  has affinity not only to  xxxg1879xxx  (ki = 11 nm)
but is also known to bind to ep1 (ki = 11 nm) and  xxxg1874xxx 
receptors (ki = 56 nm) [1]. therefore, we evaluated whether
 xxxd2331xxx -mediated sensitization of drg neurons is mediated
only by  xxxg1879xxx  or subtypes of ep receptors are also
involved in mediating this effect. ep1 is reported to couple
to gq type of g protein which receptor activation is known
to increase intracellular ca2+ [10]. the effect of  xxxd2331xxx  on
ca2+ influx was examined in drg neurons. capsaicin, which
was used as positive control in this experiment, increased
intracellular ca2+ in a concentration-dependent manner but

drg neurons was quantified by eia. data represent mean ± s.d. of one representative experiment.

 xxxd2331xxx  had marginal effect even at a 2000 nm concentration (fig. 3a). this suggests that  xxxd2331xxx  effect on drg is
not mediated by  xxxg1872xxx . in another experiment sulprostone, a  xxxg1874xxx  agonist failed to change the level of camp
accumulation and ono-1301, another ip partial agonist [19],
has a partial effect. these results might suggest that in drg
neurons effect of  xxxd2331xxx  is mediated by  xxxg1879xxx  and not
by ep receptor subtypes.
it has been reported that prostaglandins sensitized
capsaicin-evoked current in drg neurons [18]. we, therefore, examined whether  xxxd2331xxx  sensitized drg neurons
and potentiated sp release-induced by other endogenous or
exogenous chemical stimuli. drg neurons were incubated
with  xxxd2331xxx  200 nm prior to the induction of the sp release
by capsaicin, kcl and atp. as shown in fig. 4a, capsaicininduced sp release in a concentration-dependent manner and
its release was enhanced by pretreatment. similar to capsaicin, atp and kcl-induced sp release was also significantly enhanced by  xxxd2331xxx  (fig. 4b).
it is well reported that the noxious stimuli, which trigger the release of neurotransmitters from drg neurons, also
increase the intracellular ca2+ concentration. in order to
understand the mechanism of potentiating effect of pgi2 on
neurotransmitter release from drg neurons, we measured
intracellular ca2+ levels by various chemical stimuli in the
presence and absence of  xxxd2331xxx . capsaicin increased the
intracellular ca2+ levels and this effect was concentration
dependent. however,  xxxd2331xxx  (200 nm) pretreatment did not
change the effect of capsaicin on intracellular ca2+ levels
(fig. 4c). similarly, 0.1 or 1 mm atp and 10 or 30 mm
kcl-induced ca2+ influx was also not affected by  xxxd2331xxx 
(fig. 4d). capsaicin and other chemical stimuli are also
known to depolarize the cell, which then can trigger the
intracellular ca2+ levels and neurotransmitter release [4].
a few studies in the past have suggested that similarly
prostaglandins like pge2 can also change the membrane
potential and hence may have potentiating effect on intracellular ca2+ levels [7,15]. we, therefore, used fluorescencebased membrane potential indicator sensing the change of

voltage across the plasma membrane. as shown in fig. 4e,
although concentration dependent depolarization by capsaicin was observed, pretreatment of 200 nm  xxxd2331xxx  had no
effect on it. similar negative results were obtained with atp
and kcl (fig. 4f).
our results demonstrate that the expression of  xxxg1879xxx  was not changed in cyp-administrated cystitis rats.
considering that pgi2 contents in the bladder were significantly increased in cystitic rats [25], not the alteration of
 xxxg1879xxx  expression but pgi2 production might affect the
abnormal neuronal activity of unmyelinated sensory afferent. present results confirm the previous finding that among
prostaglandins, pgi2 induced the maximum camp accumulation in drg neurons [22]. we also observed that  xxxd2331xxx 
and other prostanoids sensitized lys-bradykinin-induced sp
release from drg neurons. however, pgi2 -mediated effect
is the most potent and the effect of sensitization induced
by prostanoid agonists was parallel to the potency to cause
camp accumulation. these data indicate that camp/pka
pathway might be involved in these sensitizing effects of
prostanoid agonists. the similar potentiating effect of  xxxd2331xxx  was observed for capsaicin-, atp-, or kcl-induced
sp release although  xxxd2331xxx  did not enhance ca2+ mobilization and depolarization of drg neurons membrane. the
chemical stimuli used in this study mediate their effects
by acting on a variety of receptors and ion channels. lysbk activates gq coupled  xxxg11xxx   xxxg258xxx , capsaicin activates
 xxxg2335xxx  receptors, a ligand gated non-specific cation channel,
atp activates p2x and p2y receptors and high concentration of extracellular kcl opens voltage gated ca2+ channel
(vgcc). to consider these results, it might be possible that
a certain common regulatory molecule of exocytosis mechanism is activated by  xxxd2331xxx . recent study also indicated
that exocytosis regulatory molecule is regulated by pka
[9]. in summary, our present results indicate that  xxxg1879xxx 
might be a key molecule for the release of  xxxg2240xxx  sensitization pathway in prostanoid receptors and  xxxg1879xxx 
signaling might play an important role in the sensitization of
drg neurons.
