abstract
one of the main functions of the  xxxg2342xxx  (18 kda) or  xxxg2342xxx , previously known as  xxxg2342xxx , is the
regulation of cholesterol import into mitochondria for steroid biosynthesis. in this paper we show that  xxxg2342xxx  ligands induce changes in the distribution of intracellular cholesterol in astrocytes and fibroblasts. nbd-cholesterol, a fluorescent analog of cholesterol, was rapidly removed
from membranes and accumulated into lipid droplets. this change was followed by a block of cholesterol esterification, but not by modification
of intracellular cholesterol synthesis. nbd-cholesterol droplets were in part released in the medium, and increased cholesterol efflux was observed in [3h]cholesterol-prelabeled cells.  xxxg2342xxx  ligands also induced a prominent shrinkage and depolarization of mitochondria and depletion
of acidic vesicles with cytoplasmic acidification. consistent with nbd-cholesterol changes, mtt assay showed enhanced accumulation of
formazan into lipid droplets and inhibition of formazan exocytosis after treatment with  xxxg2342xxx  ligands. the effects of specific  xxxg2342xxx  ligands
pk 11195 and ro5-4864 were reproduced by  xxxd1866xxx , which binds with high affinity both  xxxg2342xxx  and central benzodiazepine receptors,
but not by clonazepam, which binds exclusively to gaba receptor, and other amphiphilic substances such as dids and propranolol. all these
effects and the parallel immunocytochemical detection of  xxxg2342xxx  in potentially steroidogenic cells (astrocytes) and non-steroidogenic cells
(fibroblasts) suggest that  xxxg2342xxx  is involved in the regulation and trafficking of intracellular cholesterol by means of mechanisms not necessarily
related to steroid biosynthesis.

1. introduction
one of the most extensively characterized functions of the
 xxxg2342xxx  (18 kda) or  xxxg2342xxx  (papadopoulos et al.,
2006), previously known as peripheral-type benzodiazepine
receptor (pbr), is the mitochondrial import of cholesterol
(hauet et al., 2005; miller, 1988; simpson and waterman,
1983) delivered to mitochondria by cholesterol-transfer

proteins (star, mln64 and, less specifically, scp-2) (chanderbhan et al., 1982; clark et al., 1994; watari et al., 1997).
this represents the first and rate-determining step in steroid
hormone biosynthesis. accordingly, the localization, structure
and pharmacology of  xxxg2342xxx  and the effects induced by  xxxg2342xxx 
ligands have been widely investigated in steroidogenic cells
(for review see casellas et al., 2002; gavish et al., 1999;
papadopoulos, 2004). on the other hand, effects of  xxxg2342xxx 
ligands have also been found in non-steroidogenic cells, affecting different physiological mechanisms such as respiration in
heart, kidney and liver (moreno-sànchez et al., 1991; veenman
and gavish, 2006), generation of reactive oxygen species in

neurons (jayakumar et al., 2002) and hl60 human leukemia
cells (fennell et al., 2001), anion transport in kidney (basile
et al., 1988), mitochondrial permeability transition in cardiomyocytes (chelli et al., 2001), inhibition of cell proliferation
in human fibroblasts and fibrosarcoma cells (kletsas et al.,
2004) and apoptosis in various cell lines (chelli et al., 2004;
decaudin et al., 2002). increased tumorigenicity has been
found in  xxxg2342xxx  antisense knockdown cells (levin et al.,
2005; weisinger et al., 2004). many of these effects have
been attributed to the intimate association of  xxxg2342xxx  with
a complex of proteins present in mitochondrial membranes,
including the voltage-dependent anion channel ( xxxg2409xxx ), the
adenine nucleotide transporter (mcenery et al., 1992), and
the mitochondrial transition pore complex (kroemer et al.,
1997). however, in some cases, effects of  xxxg2342xxx  ligands
have been observed also in  xxxg2342xxx -deficient (hans et al.,
2005) and  xxxg2342xxx -knockdown cells (gonzalez-polo et al.,
2005; kletsas et al., 2004), raising the issue of the possible
presence of  xxxg2342xxx -independent mechanisms of actions. one
of these mechanisms may rely on the inhibition of the mitochondrial inner membrane anionic channel (imac) exerted
by several  xxxg2342xxx  ligands, namely ro5-4864 (a 40 -chloro derivative of  xxxd1866xxx ) and pk 11195 (an isoquinoline carboxamide derivative) (beavis, 1989, 1992). this hypothesis has
recently been supported by data obtained by aon et al.
(2003) in cardiomyocytes where mitochondrial potential

319

oscillations were prevented by pk 11195, ro5-4864 but also
by dids, a stilbene-2,20 -disulfonate which inhibits imac.
in the present study we investigated the acute effect of
 xxxg2342xxx  ligands on the intracellular distribution of cholesterol,
using the fluorescent analog nbd-cholesterol, and the concomitant effects on mitochondria and acidic vesicles, using
potential-sensitive (tmrm) and ph-sensitive (acridine orange) probes. we also evaluated cholesterol synthesis, esterification and efflux. our findings indicate consistent changes in
the distribution, esterification and efflux of intracellular cholesterol, accompanied by mitochondrial depolarization and
depletion of acidic vesicles. these changes were observed in
different cell types such as rat astrocytes, fibroblasts and
3t3 mouse fibroblasts, which represent potentially steroidogenic and non-steroidogenic cells. this suggests that cholesterol changes induced by  xxxg2342xxx  ligands are not necessarily
related to steroid biosynthesis.
2. materials and methods
2.1. cell cultures
mouse swiss 3t3 fibroblasts (atcc collection) and primary cultures of rat
newborn astrocytes and rat newborn fibroblasts were used in this study. experimental procedures meet the uk and ec ethical policy guidelines and regulations for the use of laboratory animals. astrocytes were characterized by
positivity to  xxxg883xxx  antibody. rat fibroblasts were

a composite color image ( xxxg2342xxx  red, mitochondria green, co-localization in yellow-orange). strong  xxxg2342xxx  immunoreactivity is found in the inner cytoplasm surrounding the nucleus, where the number of mitochondria is high. the plot shows the intensity of  xxxg2342xxx  and mitochondria immunofluorescences sampled at the
spatial resolution of 0.3 mm along a line across a single cell (white line in the color image). major  xxxg2342xxx  peaks fit well with mitochondrial profiles. however,
defined  xxxg2342xxx  peaks, not associated to mitochondria, are also present in the peripheral cytoplasm (asterisks) and in the plasma membrane (pm). a similar
 xxxg2342xxx  distribution was found in rat astrocytes.

characterized by positivity to vimentin and negativity to desmin and factor
viii antibodies. all cells were grown in dulbecco’s modified eagle’s medium
with high glucose, supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, in a 5% co2
incubator at 37  c. experiments were performed when cells were subconfluent. cells were plated in glass-bottomed dishes (mattek, ashland, ma) to allow the use of immersion objectives in fluorescence and contrast microscopy.
before treatments, serum-supplemented medium was substituted with serumfree medium. experiments were replicated in different cell types using the
same probe and drug concentrations, incubation times and data acquisition
parameters.

2.2. drugs
cells were treated in vivo with: 30e60 mm 7-chloro-5-(4-chlorophenyl)1,3-dihydro-1-methyl-2h-1,4-benzodiazepin-2-one (ro5-4864), acutely added
(a.a.); 30e60 mm 1-(2-chlorophenyl-n-methyl-1-methylpropyl)-3-isoquinoline-carboxamide (pk 11195), a.a.; 100e400 mm 2h-1,4-benzodiazepin2-one ( xxxd1866xxx ), a.a.; 100e400 mm  xxxd1727xxx  (clonazepam), a.a.; 100e400 mm 4,40 -diisothiocyanato-stilbene-2,20 -disulfonate (dids), a.a.; 60e400 mm propranolol, a.a.;

of acylcoa/ xxxg2184xxx  (acat1) for 30 min or 24 h; 1 mg/ml
phalloidin for 30 min; 1 mm paclitaxel for 45 min; 100 nm colchicine for
30 min or 2 h. vehicles were: me2so for pk 11195, ro 5-4864,  xxxd1866xxx ,
cccp, propranolol, dids, paclitaxel and sandoz 58-035; ethanol for csa;
water for phalloidin and colchicine. stock solutions were 1000-fold concentrated, to not exceed the 0.1% concentration of vehicle in the medium. the
same concentration of vehicle was added to control cells. ro5-4864, pk
11195,  xxxd1866xxx , propranolol, dids, csa, cccp, colchicine, phalloidin
and paclitaxel were from sigma (st. louis, mo, usa). sandoz 58-035 was
kindly donated by novartis (dayton, nj, usa).

2.3. probes
cells were supravitally stained with the following probes (ex, em ¼ fluorescence excitation and emission): 5 mm 22-[n-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazol-4-yl)
amino]-23,24-bisnor-5-cholen-3-ol (nbd-cholesterol) for 1 h (ex 460  25,
em 535  20); 300 nm nile red for 15 min (ex 460  25, em 535  20 for
nonpolar lipids; ex 540  12, em 590 lp for all lipids); 100 nm acridine
orange for 10 min (ex 540  12.5, em 590 lp); 100 nm tetramethylrhodamine
methyl ester perchlorate (tmrm) for 30 min (ex 540  12.5, em 590 lp);
100 nm mito tracker green fm (mitotracker) for 20 min (ex 460  25,
em 535  20); 20 mm  xxxd2131xxx  diacetate (dhf) for 30 min (ex
460  25, em 535  20); 1.25 mm mitosox for 10 min (ex 540  12.5, em
590 lp); 45 mm thiazolyl blue tetrazolium bromide (mtt) for 5e20 min;
10 mm calcein for 15 min (ex 480  20, em 520  20). nbd-cholesterol is
a fluorescent analog of cholesterol where the terminal segment of the alkyl
tail is replaced by the nbd fluorophore. nbd-cholesterol fluorescence is
environment-sensitive, being weak in aqueous media and very bright in nonpolar media (rukmini et al., 2001). nbd-cholesterol has been successfully
used to study the mechanism of sterol transfer to mitochondrial membranes
by the steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (star) and sterol carrier protein-2 (scp-2) (petrescu et al., 2001). owing to the overlap of nbd-cholesterol
and nile red emissions in the 535  20 band, for co-localization cells were
first incubated with nbd-cholesterol, then fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde to
block cytoplasm movements, photographed mapping the field position, overstained with nile red and re-photographed. mtt is a colorless compound
readily taken up by living cells and reduced to formazan (fmz), an intensely
purple substance which can be observed in brightfield microscopy. fmz is
extruded by exocytosis forming characteristic needle-like crystals on the cell
surface. acridine orange is a ph-sensitive probe, which selectively stains
acidic vesicles. tmrm is a potential-sensitive probe, which selectively accumulates in the mitochondrial matrix. mitotracker is a potential-insensitive
mitochondrial probe, which binds covalently the mitochondrial matrix, thus
enabling structural changes to be detected even after mitochondrial depolarization. dhf is a non-fluorescent derivative of fluorescein, which reverts to
fluorescent fluorescein upon oxidation by reactive oxygen species (ros).
mitosox is a fluorigenic dye, which selectively detects superoxide in mitochondria. however, mitosox fluorescence is not permanent as it leaves mitochondria after depolarization. calcein is a membrane-impermeant fluorescent
dye used to test plasma membrane integrity. vehicles were: me2so for
tmrm, dhf, mitosox, nile red, mitotracker and calcein; chloroform for
nbd-cholesterol; water for mtt and acridine orange. stock solutions were
1000-fold concentrated, to not exceed the 0.1% concentration of vehicle in
the medium. mtt was from sigma (st. louis, mo, usa); nile red and calcein from fluka (buchs, sg, switzerland); acridine orange from merck
(darmstadt, germany). other fluorescent probes were from molecular probes
(eugene, or, usa).

2.4.  xxxg2342xxx  immunocytochemistry
cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in pbs for 30 min, washed three
times in pbs for 5 min and incubated overnight with a polyclonal anti- xxxg2342xxx 
antibody (6361-pc-100, r&d systems, minneapolis, mn, usa). in some experiments, the anti- xxxg2342xxx  antibody was used in combination with a mitochondrial antibody (anti-complex v, molecular probes) to verify the association of
 xxxg2342xxx  with mitochondria. co-localization was semiquantitatively assessed by

321

linear profiles of bpr and complex v immunofluorescences sampled at the
spatial resolution of 0.3 mm (fig. 1).

2.5. imaging
observations were made using an olympus ix 71 inverted microscope
(olympus, tokyo, japan) equipped with 20 and 60 planapochromatic objectives (olympus uplansapo series) with efficient chromatic correction,
which minimized the focus and planar drift between different fluorescence filters. this was a critical requisite for the co-localization of probes, as the size
of small lipid droplets was near to the microscope resolution limit. the nominal resolutions of images taken with 20 and 60 objectives were 0.3 and
0.1 mm/pixel, respectively. the use of the inverted microscope excluded any
risk of dye contamination, as there was no contact between the immersion objective and the medium. images were taken with a 12-bit cooled ccd camera
(sensicam pco, kelheim, germany), electronically coupled to a mechanical
shutter interposed between the 100 w hg lamp and the microscope, to limit
illumination of cells for the time strictly required for the acquisition of images.
excitation light was attenuated with a 6% transmittance neutral density filter.

fig. 3. identification of nbd-cholesterol spots as lipid droplets. (a) co-localization of nbd-cholesterol and nile red. cells were incubated with 5 mm
nbd-cholesterol for 60 min, fixed, photographed at 460  25/535  20,
over-stained with nile red and photographed again at 540  12/590 lp to select nile red emission. the plot shows a close matching of nbd-cholesterol
and nile red major peaks that correspond to lipid droplets. (b) resistance of
nile red spots to triton x-100. after extraction with 0.1% triton x-100 for
30 min at room temperature, only lipid droplets (ld) were still visible whereas
perinuclear membranes (pnm) were lost. the plot shows the intensity profile
of nile red fluorescence (540  12/590 lp) before and after triton x-100
extraction. in the abscissa, 1 pixel corresponds to 0.1 mm. mouse swiss 3t3

image analysis and measurements were performed using the imagepro plus
package (media cybernetics, silver springs, md).

2.6. analysis of cholesterol synthesis
to determine the rate of cholesterol synthesis, mouse swiss 3t3 fibroblasts
were incubated 6 h at the cell density of 105 cells/ml with 185 kbq/ml of sodium [14c]acetate. after incubation cells were separated by centrifugation and
collected. cell lipids were extracted with cold acetone and neutral lipids separated by tlc on kiesegel plates using a solvent system containing heptane/
isopropylether/ xxxd2154xxx  (60:40:2 by volume). free cholesterol and cholesterol ester bands were identified by comparison with standards running simultaneously with samples and visualized using iodine vapor (folch et al., 1957).
for counting, the silica scraped from the bands was added directly to the
counting vials containing 10 ml of ultima gold. all incubations were carried
out in triplicate and the results for individual experiments are given as the
mean values. variation between triplicates was less than 10%. all data are
expressed as the rate of [14c]acetate incorporation into cholesterol per mg
protein.

2.7. analysis of cholesterol esterification
cells were incubated for 6 h in a medium containing [14c] xxxd2777xxx  bound to
bovine  xxxg124xxx  (bsa). to prepare the  xxxd2777xxx -bsa complex, 3.7 mbq
of [14c] xxxd2777xxx  in ethanol (dupont, nen specific activity 2.035 gbq/
mmol) was mixed with 1.4 mg koh and the ethanol evaporated. pbs
(1.5 ml) without ca2þ and mg2þ containing 4.24 mg bsa (fatty acid-free,
sigma) was added and the mixture shaken vigorously. this solution was added
to each well at a final concentration of 74 kbq/ml. after incubation cells were
washed with ice-cold pbs and lipids extracted with acetone. neutral lipids
were separated by tlc as described above and incorporation of [14c] xxxd2777xxx 
into cholesterol esters was measured.

2.8. analysis of cholesterol efflux
subconfluent cells were preincubated for 24 h with 0.185 mbq/ml of
[3h]cholesterol. after this period radioactive medium was removed, the cells
were washed extensively with pbs and incubated for 6 h at 37  c in conditioned medium 10% fcs. at the end of incubation cells and medium were collected separately. lipids from media were extracted with chloroform/methanol
(2:1 by volume) (folch et al., 1957) and neutral lipids were separated as described above. efflux of cholesterol was expressed as the percentage of total
(cell plus medium) [3h]cholesterol recovered from the medium. [14c]acetic
acid (specific activity 2.0 gbq/mmol), [14c] xxxd2777xxx  (specific activity
1.9 gbq/mmol) and [3h]cholesterol (specific activity 1.9 tbq/mmol) were
from dupont, new england nuclear (boston, ma, usa). kiesegel plates
were obtained from merck (darmstadt, germany) and the ultima gold scintillation fluid was from packard (meridien, ct, usa).

3. results
3.1.  xxxg2342xxx  immunocytochemistry
 xxxg2342xxx  immunoreactivity was found in both astrocytes and
3t3 fibroblasts. the intensity of immunoreaction was much
higher in astrocytes than in 3t3 fibroblasts. however, the
intracellular distribution of  xxxg2342xxx  immunostaining was similar
in the two types of cells. dual immunostaining of  xxxg2342xxx  and
mitochondria (complex v) showed a strongly preferential
localization of  xxxg2342xxx  in mitochondria, mostly concentrated
in the perinuclear cytoplasm. however,  xxxg2342xxx  immunostaining
was also detected in peripheral regions of cytoplasm, devoid of
mitochondria, and in the plasma membrane (fig. 1).
3.2. enhancement of nbd-cholesterol droplets
in untreated cells, the fluorescent cholesterol analog nbdcholesterol produced a moderate fluorescence of organelle
membranes (endoplasmic reticulum, mitochondria, etc.) and
few intensely fluorescent spots apparently similar to lipid droplets. surprisingly, treatment with  xxxg2342xxx  ligands resulted in an
increase of fluorescence of nbd-cholesterol spots, both in
astrocytes (fig. 2a) and fibroblasts (fig. 5). the change was
very rapid, being apparent as soon as 30 s after treatment. the

323

strongest effect was observed with 60 mm pk 11195, resulting
in an increase of both the fluorescence intensity and number of
nbd-cholesterol spots (fig. 2b, c).  xxxd1866xxx  (400 mm) and
ro5-4864 (60 mm) produced only an increase of fluorescence
intensity (fig. 2d). the increase of fluorescence could not be
attributed to an extra nbd-cholesterol uptake or endocytosis,
as cells were washed several times after incubation with the
fluorescent probe. moreover, the fluorescence increase of nbdcholesterol spots was accompanied by a decrease of the perinuclear fluorescence, suggesting a process of nbd-cholesterol
transfer from cytoplasmic membranes to isolated spots.
to verify the nature of nbd-cholesterol spots, cells were
overstained with nile red, a specific stain of lipid droplets.
though nile red can be used in vivo, cells were fixed to block
organelle movements and co-localize probes at micron resolution. all nbd-cholesterol spots were stained by nile red, thus
revealing the nature of lipid droplets (fig. 3a). in addition,
nbd-cholesterol spots resisted extraction with 0.1% triton
x-100 for 30 min at room temperature, whereas fluorescent
traces of cytoplasmic membranes were lost (fig. 3b). these
findings support the hypothesis that nbd-cholesterol is initially partitioned between cytoplasmic membranes and lipid
droplets. treatment with  xxxg2342xxx  ligands induces a redistribution
of nbd-cholesterol, which preferentially accumulates in lipid
droplets.

although nbd-cholesterol has been proven to be a suitable
substrate for esterification by acylcoa/cholesterol acyltransferase (acat) (lada et al., 2004), overnight treatment with
the sandoz-compound 58-035, a potent acat inhibitor, did
not prevent the enhancement of nbd-cholesterol droplets induced by  xxxg2342xxx  ligands. experiments with radioactive markers,
in the absence of nbd-cholesterol, showed that pk 11195
itself (ro5-4864 not tested) is a strong inhibitor of cholesterol
esterification (fig. 4a). owing to the relatively long (6 h)
duration of pk 11195 treatments required to assess cholesterol
esterification and cholesterol synthesis, pk 11195 concentrations were slightly lower than those used in acute administration

(20e40 mm rather than 30e60 mm). pk 11195 (40 mm) induced a complete block of cholesterol esterification, whereas
the effect of 20 mm pk 11195 was remarkably lower. however,
pk 11195 did not modify endogenous cholesterol synthesis
(fig. 4b) nor did it affect cell viability, as evaluated by trypan
blue exclusion test. the relative agreement between the range
of effective concentrations required to inhibit cholesterol esterification and to enhance nbd-cholesterol droplets suggests the
existence of a common mechanism of action.
the accumulation of unesterified nbd-cholesterol in lipid
droplets does not contrast with the composition of lipid droplets which are known to contain mostly esterified cholesterol.

found in the medium. the droplets (encircled particles) are better visualized after contrast enhancement. the absence of necrotic cells excluded the release of
fluorescent particles by a mechanism of cell fragmentation. mouse swiss 3t3 fibroblasts. (b) release of fmz granules in the medium. the pictures show the

free cholesterol has been found on the surface of lipid droplets
of adipocytes (prattes et al., 2000) and peritoneal macrophages
(mcgookey and anderson, 1983), and is generally assumed
that the lipid droplet surface represents a region of exchange
between the pool of free cholesterol present in membranes
and the pool of esterified cholesterol present in the inner
droplet core.
the enhancement of nbd-cholesterol droplets induced by
 xxxg2342xxx  ligands was not inhibited by previous depolarization
of mitochondria with cccp or rotenone (fig. 5), indicating
that the effect of  xxxg2342xxx  ligands was independent of the energetic  xxxd1866xxx  of mitochondria.
ten to fifteen minutes after pk treatment, a few free-floating nbd-cholesterol droplets were also found in the medium.
the number of fluorescent particles present in the medium was
only a minimal fraction (<1%) of those present in the cytoplasm, however the phenomenon was clearly evident due to
the bright fluorescence of particles on the black extracellular
background (fig. 6a) and confirmed by repeated experiments.
as the natural rate of 1e2% cell death was not increased by
 xxxg2342xxx  ligands (acridine orange, which heavily stains the chromatin of dead cells, including apoptotic cells, was steadily excluded by the nucleus of treated cells; tmrm showed a partial
recovery of the mitochondrial potential at this stage, which
excluded the occurrence of mitochondrial permeability transition, as shown in the next sections) the release of nbdcholesterol particles could not be attributed to cell debris
due to cell lysis. in addition, the fact that experiments were
carried out in serum-free medium also excluded a mechanism
of release associated to extracellular cholesterol-transporting
lipoproteins. thus, the only explanation for this phenomenon
was an active discharge of lipid droplets in the medium.
this hypothesis was consistent with the considerable increase
of cholesterol efflux detected in pk 11195-treated cells using
[3h]cholesterol (fig. 4c). fluorescent particles released in the
medium were not sensitive to osmotic changes produced by diluting the medium with an equal volume of distilled water
(data not shown), confirming their nature of compact lipid
bodies as opposed to vesicles.

treated with 60 mm pk 11195, are the site of accumulation of fmz. the
pictures (see insets at higher magnification) show a complete correspondence between fmz granules and nbd-cholesterol droplets. some shift
in the location of fmz granules is due to the gap of 30 min between
images. note the higher number of nbd-cholesterol droplets, which is

reflected by a higher number of fmz granules, in cells treated with pk

clearance of the cytoplasm (asterisk) and the appearance of characteristic
needle-like fmz crystals on the surface (arrows). all fmz was eliminated
within 1 h from the time of mtt uptake. on the other hand, large fmz
granules persisted up to 7 h after mtt uptake in cells treated with 60 mm
pk 11195. however, exocytosis was not completely inhibited by pk
11195, as fmz crystals were also present on the surface of pk 11195treated cells, although different from those of untreated cells. they were
shorter, thicker and apparently similar to those produced in cells treated
with cytotoxic amyloid peptides (liu et al., 1998). rat newborn fibroblasts.

3.3. enhanced mtt reduction, decreased formazan
exocytosis and acidic vesicles de-acidification
during routine viability tests with thiazolyl blue tetrazolium
bromide (mtt), we incidentally found that formazan (fmz),
the product of mtt reduction, co-localized with nbd-cholesterol and nile red (fig. 7a). the accumulation of fmz in lipid
droplets is a new finding, not reported previously, although it is
consistent with the strongly lipophilic nature of fmz, and an accurate examination of fmz granules showed that their apparent
vesicle-like morphology is due to phase interference, the size of
fmz granules being close to the microscope resolution limit
(fig. 7b). unfortunately, nbd-cholesterol and nile red fluorescences were totally quenched by mtt, thereby impeding the
contemporaneous detection of fluorescent probes and fmz.
however, the localization of fmz in pre-existing nbd-cholesterol droplets was clear, even in the presence of small displacements (visible in fig. 7a) due to cell movements during the
time interval between the loss of nbd-cholesterol fluorescence
and the appearance of fmz granules. moreover, co-localization
was complete, in the sense that all lipid droplets were later stained
by fmz. this was observed in control cells as well as in cells
treated with  xxxg2342xxx  ligands. the rate of formation of fmz granules was significantly increased by pk 11195 and ro5-4864,
even in the absence of nbd-cholesterol (fig. 7c). on the other
hand, fmz exocytosis was strongly inhibited in cells treated
with  xxxg2342xxx  ligands, where large fmz granules persisted in the cytoplasm up to 7 h after mtt treatment, whereas fmz granules
were completely eliminated by untreated cells within 1 h after
mtt treatment (fig. 7d). parallel to extrusion of intact nbdcholesterol droplets, intact fmz granules were seen to be released
from cells treated with  xxxg2342xxx  ligands (fig. 6b).
in agreement with previous data (liu et al., 1997), a substantial separation was found between fmz granules and
acidic vesicles stained with acridine orange. however, strong
depletion of acidic vesicles and acidification of the surrounding cytosol were detected after treatment with  xxxg2342xxx  ligands
(fig. 8). this finding may be pharmacologically relevant, in
view of the fact that the transvesicular acidic gradient represents an important mechanism, required for neurotransmitter
refilling and retention within synaptic vesicles (cousin and
nicholls, 1997).

3.4. mitochondrial changes
concomitant with the formation of nbd-cholesterol droplets, pk 11195 and ro5-4864 induced a prominent shrinkage
and granulation of mitochondria. these structural changes
were detected both with potential-sensitive and potentialinsensitive probes (tmrm and mitotracker, respectively),
and were followed by the eventual collapse of the mitochondrial potential (fig. 9). however, a partial recovery of the normal morphology and transmembrane potential was generally
observed 10e15 min after treatment. the intensity of mitochondrial changes was correlated to the concentration of
 xxxg2342xxx  ligands, used in the same range of concentrations affecting nbd-cholesterol droplets and cholesterol esterification.
mitosox, a probe sensitive both to ros and mitochondrial
potential, showed a fast rise of mitochondrial ros preceding
depolarization (data not shown). structural alterations induced
by  xxxg2342xxx  ligands were strongly enhanced by rotenone pretreatment. on the other hand, csa was unable to prevent
mitochondrial changes, suggesting that the permeability transition pore was not involved. also, substances interfering
with microtubules (colchicine, paclitaxel) or microfilaments
(phalloidin) did not prevent the effects of  xxxg2342xxx  ligands on
mitochondria.
3.5. changes induced by  xxxg2342xxx  ligands are neither due
to imac inhibition nor to plasma membrane
permeabilization
since ro5-4864 and pk 11195 have been shown to inhibit
the mitochondrial inner membrane anionic channel (imac)
(beavis, 1989, 1992), additional experiments were performed
with propranolol and dids, two known imac inhibitors
(beavis, 1989; beavis and davatol-hag, 1996) to verify the
role played by imac in the formation of nbd-cholesterol
droplets and mitochondrial changes. a moderate granulation
of mitochondria, but neither depolarization nor formation of
nbd-cholesterol droplets, was observed using 400 mm propranolol or 400 mm dids.
as mitochondria are particularly sensitive to osmotic and
ionic perturbations, other experiments were performed to verify whether mitochondrial changes were induced by increased

plasma membrane permeability or ion influx (namely kþ and
cl) from the medium. calcein, a membrane-impermeant
fluorescent probe used to test plasma membrane integrity,
was steadily excluded from cells treated with  xxxg2342xxx  ligands.
in addition, substitution of the culture medium with 0.1 m
na-phosphate buffer ph 7.0, osmotically balanced with sucrose, allowed mitochondria to maintain a normal morphology
and transmembrane potential for about 10 min. during this interval, cells responded to  xxxg2342xxx  ligands with the same changes
observed in cells growing in the normal medium (data not
shown).
4. discussion

fig. 9. structural and functional changes of mitochondria induced by pk
11195. using the potential-sensitive probe tmrm, untreated cells (baseline)
show morphologically smooth and intensely stained mitochondrial filaments.
soon after treatment with 60 mm pk 11195, a prominent shrinkage and granulation of mitochondria followed by massive depolarization is observed. to
better visualize the changes, the mitochondrial filament indicated with the asterisk in the top picture is shown at higher magnification in insets. rat newborn astrocytes. bar is 10 mm for the main frames, 3.5 mm for insets.

in interpreting data obtained with  xxxg2342xxx  ligands in intact
cells, a major problem is represented by the fact that effective concentrations are much higher than affinity values for
 xxxg2342xxx , with the possibility of aspecific interactions with
 xxxg2342xxx -independent targets. such an eventuality is also suggested by the effects of  xxxg2342xxx  ligands found in  xxxg2342xxx -deficient (hans et al., 2005) and  xxxg2342xxx -knockdown cells
(gonzalez-polo et al., 2005; kletsas et al., 2004). one aspecific target of  xxxg2342xxx  ligands has been identified in the mitochondrial inner membrane anionic channel (imac) that
is inhibited by ro5-4864 with an ic50 of 34 mm (beavis,
1989), which is in the range of active concentrations generally found in investigations with intact cells. to overcome
this ambiguity, our experiments, initially restricted to pk
11195 and ro5-4864, were extended to  xxxd1866xxx  (generally
excluded from experimental studies, as it binds with high
affinity both  xxxg2342xxx  and central benzodiazepine receptors),
clonazepam, which binds only to gaba receptor, and two
representative imac inhibitors, propranolol and dids.
though with differences in the intensity, all three  xxxg2342xxx  ligands produced qualitatively similar effects consisting in the
(a) enhancement of nbd-cholesterol droplets, (b) shrinkage
and depolarization of mitochondria, and (c) de-acidification
of acidic vesicles. these changes were not observed either
with clonazepam or with imac inhibitors, exception made
for a moderate mitochondrial shrinkage (but no depolarization). the common effect of all  xxxg2342xxx  ligands tested, versus
the lack of effect of clonazepam and imac inhibitors, supports an involvement of  xxxg2342xxx  and rules out the hypothesis
of aspecific interactions with anionic channels.
the localization of nbd-cholesterol in lipid droplets has
previously been found in l-cell fibroblasts (frolov et al.,
2000). the uptake of nbd-cholesterol was very rapid, about
100-fold faster than that of dehydroergosterol and [3h]cholesterol. in addition, the fluorescence of cytoplasmic membranes
showed a progressive increase of intensity correlated to the duration of the nbd-cholesterol incubation (from 30 to 90 min).
these findings suggest that nbd-cholesterol reaches a high
intracellular concentration which escapes the complex homeostatic mechanisms which control the concentration of natural,
free or esterified, cholesterol (for a review see soccio and breslow, 2004). thus, an overload of nbd-cholesterol may be the
 xxxd1866xxx  for the massive transfer of nbd-cholesterol from

328

a.m. falchi et al. / neuropharmacology 53 (2007) 318e329

cytoplasmic membranes to lipid droplets, induced by  xxxg2342xxx  ligands. on the other hand, the fact that  xxxg2342xxx  ligands alone
were capable of this change suggests a specific interaction between  xxxg2342xxx  and cholesterol. the almost complete block of
cholesterol esterification and the nearly two-fold increase of
cholesterol efflux, detected with methods that did not involve
the use of nbd-cholesterol, support this hypothesis. it should
be verified whether the release of nbd-cholesterol droplets,
in the absence of cholesterol-transporting lipoproteins, also
occurs in vivo, as this would represent an as yet unknown
form of sterol release.
the increased rate of formation of fmz granules induced
by  xxxg2342xxx  ligands is consistent with the increased mass of
lipid droplets, which provide a higher number of available
sites for fmz accumulation. the transfer of cholesterol to
lipid bodies may also explain the inhibition of fmz exocytosis, in agreement with the fact that fmz exocytosis depends
on the availability of free (membrane) cholesterol (liu et al.,
1998).
the detection of mitochondrial alterations by mitotracker,
a probe scarcely influenced by the mitochondrial potential,
proved the structural nature of changes induced by  xxxg2342xxx  ligands. the observed granulation and fragmentation of mitochondria is also consistent with data recently obtained by aon
et al. (2003) in cardiomyocytes with pk 11195 and ro5-4864
at micromolar concentrations. in these cells,  xxxg2342xxx  ligands effectively blocked cell-wide oscillations of mitochondrial potential and propagation of mitochondrial ros locally induced by
photoactivation. as cardiomyocyte mitochondria are linked in
network by specific inter-organelle junctions (amchenkova
et al., 1988), it is likely that mitochondrial fragmentation would
also interrupt propagation of mitochondrial potential fluctuations and ros. the structural and functional changes of mitochondria correlate with the prevalent localization of  xxxg2342xxx  in
this organelle, as confirmed by immunocytochemical data obtained in astrocytes and 3t3 fibroblasts. the different intensity
of the immunoreaction, which was lower in 3t3 fibroblasts, is
consistent with the fact that 3t3 fibroblasts have been found
to express  xxxg2342xxx  mrna levels comparable to those of steroidogenic cells, but lower levels of protein transcripts (giatzakis and
papadopoulos, 2004).
at present, no hypotheses can be put forward as to the mechanisms by which  xxxg2342xxx  ligands induce the various changes
found in this study. however, despite their apparent heterogeneity, several common features, which constitute a basis for
comprehension, can be delineated. in summary,  xxxg2342xxx  ligands
induced rapid and simultaneous effects in distinct subcellular
compartments, including membrane-delimited organelles (mitochondria and acidic vesicles), lipid droplets and lipid-based
inclusions (formazan). these effects were detected both in potentially steroidogenic (astrocytes) and non-steroidogenic (3t3
fibroblasts) cells, thus ruling out an exclusive relationship
with steroid biosynthesis. this is also confirmed by the unresponsiveness of nbd-cholesterol changes to disruption of the
mitochondrial electrochemical gradient, as the mitochondrial
import of star has been shown not to occur in de-energized
mitochondria (king and stocco, 1996; king et al., 1999).
