sirolimus: its discovery, biological properties, and mechanism of
action
s.n. sehgal*
abstract
sirolimus is the usan-assigned generic name for the natural product rapamycin.
sirolimus is produced by a strain of streptomyces hygroscopicus, isolated from a soil sample
collected from rapa nui commonly known as easter island. although sirolimus was
isolated as an antifungal agent with potent anticandida activity, subsequent studies
revealed impressive antitumor and immunosuppressive activities. sirolimus demonstrates
activity against several murine tumors, such as b16 43 melanocarcinoma, colon 26 tumor,
em ependymoblastoma, and mammary and colon 38 solid tumors. sirolimus is a potent
inhibitor of antigen-induced proliferation of t cells, b cells, and antibody production.
demonstration of the potent immunosuppressive activity of sirolimus in animal models of
organ transplantation led to clinical trials and subsequent approval by regulatory authorities for prophylaxis of renal graft rejection. interest in sirolimus as an immunosuppressive
therapy in organ transplantation derives from its unique mechanism of action, its unique
side-effect profile, and its ability to synergize with other immunosuppressive agents. the
molecular mechanism underlying the antifungal, antiproliferative, and immunosuppressive
activities of sirolimus is the same. sirolimus forms an immunosuppressive complex with
intracellular protein,  xxxg798xxx . this complex blocks the activation of the cell-cycle–specific
kinase, tor. the downstream events that follow the inactivation of tor result in the
blockage of cell-cycle progression at the juncture of g1 and s phase.

uring a discovery program for novel antimicrobial
agents from natural sources, a large number of
actinomycetes and fungi were isolated in our laboratories
from soil samples collected from diverse geographic
sources. we acquired 73 soil samples collected by members
of a canadian expedition to rapa nui, commonly known as
easter island. a strain of streptomyces hygroscopicus was
isolated from a soil sample collected from the vai atare
region of rapa nui. the culture of this organism was found
to exhibit antifungal properties in a mechanism-based
screening protocol. the active principle was isolated from
the mycelium of the streptomyces and a crystalline material,
obtained after purification, was found to have potent antifungal activity. the antibiotic was named rapamycin (etymology: rapa [rapa nui]-mycin).1,2 rapamycin has now
been assigned the generic name sirolimus and the trademark name  xxxd3206xxx . although sirolimus was isolated as
an antifungal agent with potent anticandida activity, subsequent studies have revealed impressive antitumor/antiproliferative and immunosuppressive properties. its unique
mechanism of action and remarkable potency in inhibiting

allograft rejection in animal models of organ transplantation has heightened the interest in this drug for clinical use.
sirolimus is a white crystalline solid with a melting range
of 183° to 185°c. structurally, it is a lipophilic macrocyclic
lactone, soluble in most organic solvents and virtually
insoluble in water. although we reported the isolation and
primary characterization of sirolimus in 1975, complete
structural assignment based on x-ray crystallography did not
become available until 1981.3 further studies conducted to
elucidate the biosynthesis of sirolimus,4 as well as twodimensional nuclear magnetic resonance studies, have led
to the correct assignment of the structure (fig 1). 5

mechanism of action

the molecular mechanism underlying the antifugal, antitumor/antiproliferative, and immunosuppressive activities of
sirolimus has been reviewed previously.6 sirolimus and the
structurally related immunosuppressive drug, tacrolimus
(tac), interact with a family of intracellular binding proteins termed fkbps (fk binding proteins, the most relevant being  xxxg798xxx ); cyclosporine (csa), however, a cyclic
peptide, forms a complex with  xxxg798xxx . these intracellular binding proteins, collectively called immunophilins,
function as cis/trans peptidylprolyl isomerases (ppiase).
binding of the drugs with their respective immunophilins
inhibits ppiase activity. although formation of a drug:
immunophilin complex is essential for immunosuppressive
actions, the inhibition of ppiase activity is only coincidental
and not essential for immunosuppression.7 instead, drug:
immunophilin interaction results in the formation of an
immunosuppressive complex that modulates the activity of
other specific intracellular targets. tac and csa, when
complexed with their respective immunophilins, form a
ternary complex with calcineurin, a ca⫹ calmodulin-dependent serine/threonine phosphatase, causing its inactivation.
this results in inhibition of the ability of calcineurin to
dephosphorylate the cytoplasmic subunit of the nuclear
factor of activation of t cell (nfat), thereby blocking its
translocation to the nucleus, which is required for the
transcription of cytokine genes.8,9 the search for the intracellular target of the sirolimus:fkbp complex led to the
discovery of a pivotal regulator of cell growth and proliferation, the  xxxg1478xxx  (tor).10 –13 mammalian
tor (mtor) is a 289-kd protein that has a c-terminal
600-amino-acid domain with homology to several pi kinases, including the p110 subunit of mammalian pi 3
kinase. a 133-amino-acid hydrophobic sirolimus:fkbp
binding domain is located immediately upstream of the
lipid kinase sequence. the sirolimus:fkbp complex binds

directly to mtor and blocks its function. by interfering
with the function of mtor, sirolimus inhibits the mtormediated signal-transduction pathways, resulting in the
arrest of cell cycle in g1 phase (fig 2) in various cell types.
mammalian tor-mediated signal-transduction pathways are shown in fig 3. mammalian tor activates  xxxg1989xxx 
(p70 ribosomal s6 kinase). the activation of  xxxg1989xxx  by
mtor is possibly mediated by  xxxg1989xxx  phosphorylation
and/or by restraining certain phosphatases such as protein
phosphatase 1 and protein phosphatase 2a (pp2a). upon
activation,  xxxg1989xxx  phosphorylates the s6 protein of the 40s
ribosomal subunit. s6 activation dramatically increases the
translation of a class of mrna transcripts containing a
polypyrimidine tract (5⬘ top),15 such as ribosomal proteins
or  xxxg679xxx  elongation factor for protein synthesis.16 the
increase in protein synthesis by growth factor–mediated
activation of mtor is blocked by sirolimus.
activated  xxxg1989xxx  mediates activation of crem␶, a member of the camp-response-element-binding (creb/atf)
family of transcription factors, resulting in camp-induced
late gene transcription and transcription of proliferating
nuclear cell antigen (pnca).17,18 these events are inhibited by sirolimus.
crosslinking of cd28 in t lymphocytes results in the
activation of  xxxg1989xxx  and c-re1, a cd28-response-elementbinding factor. in the absence of costimulation, c-re1 is
sequestered in the cytoplasm as a complex with the regulatory  xxxg165xxx ␬b␣. costimulation leads to the phosphorylation-dependent degradation of i␬b␣, allowing the translocation of c-re1 to the nucleus and transcription activation
of some genes. cd28-mediated degradation of i␬b␣ and
translocation of c-re1 to the nucleus is blocked by sirolimus.19 thus, sirolimus affects cd28-mediated sustained
upregulation of il-2 transcription in t cells.
another biochemical event leading to protein translation,
which is affected by mtor, is the phosphorylation of the
 xxxg692xxx  binding protein ( xxxg693xxx ). in resting cells,  xxxg693xxx 
interacts with the mrna 5⬘ cap-binding protein,  xxxg692xxx ,
controlling cap-dependent translation initiation. the
growth factor–induced stimulation of cells leads to the
activation of mtor. phosphorylation of  xxxg693xxx  by
mtor20,21 decreases its affinity for  xxxg692xxx . this results in
relief of translational inhibition and the translation of some
specific mrnas necessary for cell growth and proliferation.
these events are blocked by sirolimus-mediated inhibition
of activation of mtor.
in addition to its effects on protein translation, sirolimus
dramatically diminishes the kinase activity of the  xxxg411xxx /
cyclin d and  xxxg410xxx /cyclin e complexes that normally peak in
middle to late g1 phase.22 growth factor–induced activation of cells causes a change in stoichiometry between the
cyclin-dependent kinases and their inhibitors, p21 and
 xxxg419xxx , resulting in the activation of cdk/cyclin complexes.
sirolimus blocks the elimination of  xxxg419xxx  and the activation
of cdk/cyclin complexes. consequently, downstream events,
including hyperphosphorylation of retinoblastoma proteins
and disassociation of the rb:e2f complex are inhibited,

from a ternary interaction with calcineurin. calcineurin is a calmodulin– calcium-dependent phosphatase needed to dephosphorylate
the nfat nuclear factor of activation of t cell). dephosphorylation allows translocation of nfat to the nucleus and initiation of
transcription of il-2. inactivation of calcineurin blocks the transcription of interleukins. the sirolimus:fkpb12 complex, on the other
hand, has no effect on calcineurin. the sirolimus:fkpb12 complex interacts with and blocks the activation of a pivotal cell-cycle kinase
named mtor (mammalian  xxxg1478xxx .

resulting in decreased synthesis of cell-cycle proteins,  xxxg407xxx 
and  xxxg365xxx .23
antifungal activity

sirolimus is one of the most potent anticandida compounds
known. in in vitro studies, sirolimus gave lower minimum
inhibitory concentrations (mic) than  xxxd418xxx , nystatin,
and  xxxd164xxx  against eight clinical isolates of candida.2 a role of  xxxg798xxx  in mediating the inhibition of fungal
growth with sirolimus was demonstrated in yeast. deletion
of the  xxxg798xxx  homolog of yeast ( xxxg1938xxx ) yielded cells
showing growth that was resistant to sirolimus.24 sirolimus
sensitivity was restored upon insertion of the human
 xxxg798xxx  gene.25 this suggests that formation of the sirolimus:fkbp complex is essential for the antifugal activity of
sirolimus.
sirolimus was compared with  xxxd164xxx  in the
treatment of systemic candidosis in mice. sirolimus at 20
mg/kg orally or subcutaneously and  xxxd164xxx  at 1
mg/kg orally, gave the same degree of protection. sirolimus
was also found to be very active orally in the treatment of an
experimental vaginal candidosis in rats.26 although its in
vivo antifungal activity and presumed unique mechanism of
action appeared quite promising, the development of siroli-

mus as a systemic antifungal drug was not pursued due to its
potent immunosuppressive activity, an undesirable attribute
of an anti-infective agent.

antitumor activity

in addition to its anticandida effect, sirolimus also inhibits
the proliferation of transformed cell lines of lymphoid,
central nervous system, hepatic, melanocytic, osteoblastic,
myogenic, renal, and connective tissue origin, as well as the
proliferation of t and b cells transformed by htlv-1 and
ebv, respectively.27 although sirolimus was found to be
only marginally active against lymphocytic leukemia p388, it
was very active against b16 melanocarcinoma, em ependymoblastoma, cd8f1 mammary, and colon 38 tumors.28 in
murine models of b16 and colon 38 tumors,29 sirolimus was
more active than 5-fluorouracil (5-fu) and adriamycin
(adr). sirolimus was found to be compatible with 5-fu
and cyclophosphamide (cyp) in cotreatment studies in
colon 38 tumor– bearing mice. this combination afforded
better protection than any of the other drugs given alone
and was superior to the sequence 5-fu, adr, and cyp, a
combination that has found application in cancer therapy.

fig 3. biochemical events that accompany the activation of mtor are shown. these events are inhibited by the binding of
sirolimus:fkbp to mtor. sirolimus causes rapid inactivation of  xxxg1989xxx  that is critical for the phosphorylation of ribosomal s6 protein.
sirolimus also inhibits cd28-mediated downregulation of i␬b␣. in resting cells, i␬b␣ associates with transcription factor, c-rel,
sequestering it in the cytoplasm. costimulation via cd28 causes downregulation of i␬b␣ and promotes translocation of c-rel into the
nucleus, where it is implicated in the transcriptional regulation of several  xxxg1173xxx  genes. sirolimus also inhibits the mtor-mediated
biochemical event that leads to protein translation. in resting cells,  xxxg693xxx  interacts with the mrna 5⬘ cap-binding protein,  xxxg692xxx ,
controlling cap-dependent translation initiation. activated mtor phosphorylates  xxxg693xxx  by decreasing its affinity for  xxxg692xxx . this
results in relieving translational inhibition and the translation of some specific mrnas necessary for cell growth and proliferation. the
other downstream events affected by sirolimus include dissociation of  xxxg419xxx  from the  xxxg410xxx :cyclin e complex, inhibiting their
activation.

in vitro cellular effects of sirolimus

the immunosuppressive effects of sirolimus result from its
inhibition of t- and b-cell activity (table 1). sirolimus
inhibits murine, porcine, and human t-lymphocyte proliferation induced by mitogens, alloantigens, phorbol esters
and calcium ionophore, lymphokines, and crosslinking of
cellular receptors with monoclonal antibodies (eg, cd3 and
cd28).30 –32 these results suggest that, in contrast to csa
and tac, which block t-cell activation induced by stimuli
employing ca2⫹-dependent pathways,30,33–37 sirolimus can
inhibit proliferation to stimuli, which induce either ca2⫹dependent or -independent signal transduction pathways.
sirolimus blocks the cell-cycle progression in mid-to-late
g1 phase,38 consistent with the finding that sirolimus can
block lymphocyte proliferation even when added up to 12
hours after the initiation of the stimulation.30,39 although

sirolimus blocks interleukin-2 (il-2)–induced proliferation
of t cells, it does not affect the signal that results in the
activation-induced apoptosis.40 the effects of sirolimus are
limited not only to il-2– or il-4 –mediated proliferation of
t cells, but also include inhibition of il-12,41  xxxg1183xxx ,42 and
il-15– driven proliferation of activated t cells.43 indeed, in
il-2 and il-4 knockout mice, sirolimus but not csa was
able to extend the survival of allografted islets in mice.44
sirolimus inhibits lipopolysaccharide (lps)-induced proliferation of b cells resistant to tac and csa through a
calcium-independent pathway. sirolimus inhibits il-2– dependent and –independent proliferation of purified normal
human b lymphocytes stimulated with staphylococcus aureus (sa) and soluble  xxxg390xxx  in mid-g1 phase of the cell
cycle.45 it also prevents sa and il-2– or il-6 – dependent
differentiation into antibody-producing cells, thereby de-

creasing the production of immunoglobulins m, g, and a.46
in heart-allografted rats, sirolimus has been reported to
inhibit the production of cytotoxic but not of noncytotoxic
igg2c-blocking antibodies.47 inhibition of differentiation
and proliferation of b cells with sirolimus probably contribute to its immunoregulatory effects.
sirolimus has been shown to inhibit growth factor–
mediated proliferation of nonimmune cells. it blocks basic
fibroblast growth factor ( xxxg787xxx )-induced proliferation of
bovine aortic, human umbilical vein endothelial cells, and
3t3.48 sirolimus also inhibits  xxxg787xxx  and platelet-derived
growth factor (pdgf)-stimulated proliferation of smooth
muscle cells.49,50 sirolimus-mediated inhibition of smooth
muscle cells can be antagonized by molar excess of fk
506,51 suggesting that the sirolimus:fkbp complex, as
discussed earlier, is also required for the effects of sirolimus
on nonimmune cells.
interactions between csa, sirolimus, and tac

in vitro combination studies have shown that csa and
sirolimus act synergistically in the inhibition of t- and b-cell
proliferation.32,52 the synergism between sirolimus and
csa was confirmed by median effect analysis in the heterotopic heart allograft model rat.53 median effect analysis of
data from two phase iii clinical trials has suggested a
synergistic interaction between sirolimus and csa54 in
humans. in contrast, sirolimus and tac in 50- to 1000-fold
molar excess are selective reciprocal antagonists in the in
vitro cellular assays.55,56 these in vitro studies were the first
to suggest that a common cellular receptor,  xxxg798xxx , is
involved in the intracellular events leading to inhibition of
proliferation by sirolimus and tac. however, in the heterotopic heart and kidney allograft models in the rat and in
the orthotopic kidney allograft model in male vervet monkeys, the combination of both drugs was reported to be

synergistic.57,58 these results were not unexpected, because
in vivo, at therapeutic doses, a molecular excess is not
achieved and there is an excess of  xxxg798xxx  to create the
immunosuppressive complexes of both drugs.

sirolimus in experimental animal models

sirolimus has been demonstrated to prolong graft survival
in many animal models of transplantation, ranging from
rodents to primates for both heterotopic as well as orthotopic organ grafting, bone marrow transplantation, and islet
cell grafting.7
rat recipients of neonatal heterotopic hearts were
treated orally (po) with sirolimus. in this nonvascularized
heart allograft model, sirolimus whole blood trough concentrations were directly correlated with dose and graft
survival rate. a significant increase in graft survival occurred when sirolimus trough concentrations were as low as
0.5 to 0.7 ng/ml (daily po dose of 0.3 mg/kg). sirolimus not
only prolonged graft survival in a dose-dependent manner,
but with mean trough concentrations of 7 ng/ml the grafts
survived, despite cessation of treatment.59
the relationship between dosage, whole blood concentration, and efficacy of sirolimus was also investigated in a
study in pigs transplanted with mismatched orthotopic renal
grafts. sirolimus blood concentrations correlated with the
dose administered, and sirolimus prolonged graft survival in
a dose-related manner. at a trough concentration of 7 to 8
ng/ml, grafts survival after cessation of drug treatment. no
significant drug-related changes in hematologic or clinical
chemistry parameters were seen in the sirolimus treatment
group.60
pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic studies have shown
that whole blood concentrations of sirolimus of between 5
and 60 ng/ml support maximum prolongation of allografts

12s

in the rabbit, dog, pig, and rat, without significant sideeffects.61
the effect of a combination of sirolimus and csa on
allograft survival was also examined. in two separate studies, the drugs were given either intravenously (iv) by
continuous infusion or po to rat recipients of heterotopic
heart allografts. when given iv, no significant pharmacokinetic interaction between sirolimus and csa was observed. however, the combination index analysis (ci ⫽ 1
reflects additive, ci ⬎ 1 antagonistic, and ci ⬍ 1 synergistic
effects) documented potent synergism between the two
drugs, with ci values of 0.001 to 0.2 for heart allografts.62
unlike continuous iv infusion, po administration of sirolimus in combination with csa produces a pharmacokinetic
interaction that increases the whole blood trough concentrations of sirolimus and csa. the investigation of the
effect of pharmacokinetic interaction on synergism between
sirolimus and csa demonstrated that the pharmacokinetic
interaction between po sirolimus and csa was not solely
responsible for their synergism, but contributed to the in
vivo pharmacodynamic synergism between the two drugs.
we have also examined the effects of sirolimus in models of
spontaneously occurring autoimmune diseases in mice (the
mrl/lpr mouse, a model of systemic lupus erythematosus,
and the nonobese diabetic mouse, a model of insulin-dependent mellitus diabetes) and in t-cell–mediated disease models
of arthritis and experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (a
model of multiple sclerosis) in the rat. sirolimus was highly
effective in preventing the onset and severity of disease in all
these animal models of autoimmune diseases.64
as previously stated, the antiproliferative effects sirolimus also extend to growth factor–induced proliferation of
smooth muscle cells (smc). because the response of
arterial vessels to balloon injury following angioplasty results in intimal thickening characterized by the migration
and proliferation of smc,65 the effects of sirolimus on this
process were determined in a rat and a pig model of balloon
catheter injury–induced restenosis. sirolimus at 1.5 mg/kg
for 13 days decreased the intimal percentage by 65% (p ⬍
.001) over untreated controls in the rat.66 in the pig model,
the animals were given a loading dose of 0.5 mg/kg per day
intramuscularly (im) for 3 days before percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (ptca), and then continued
with a lower maintenance dose of 0.25 mg/kg per day im for
14 days. results of the average values of coronary stenosis
induced by balloon angioplasty analyzed at killing, 4 weeks
after ptca, showed that administration of sirolimus was
associated with a reduction in the degree of coronary
stenosis, 36 ⫾ 4.5% versus 63 ⫾ 3.4% (p ⬍ .0001).67 recent
clinical investigations of sirolimus-eluting stents demonstrated that locally released sirolimus from sirolimus-coated
stents effectively blocked neointimal proliferation in patients who had undergone angioplasty.68
the response of vessels to immunomediated graft vascular disease (gvd) is morphologically similar to the response to balloon catheter injury and is also characterized
by the migration and proliferation of smc.65 therefore, the

sehgal

effect of sirolimus was determined in a newly developed
nonhuman primate model of gvd where progression of
gvd is quantified by intravascular ultrasound (ivus).
cynomolgus monkeys with aortic transplants from bloodgroup-compatible but mixed lymphocyte reaction–mismatched donors were not treated for the first 6 weeks to
allow the development of gvd in the allograft. in the
treatment group, monkeys were treated po with 2 mg/kg
per day of sirolimus from day 45 after transplantation to day
105. progression of gvd measured as a change in intimal
area from day 42 to 105 was halted in sirolimus-treated
monkeys as compared with untreated monkeys (p ⬍ .001).
on day 105, the intimal area was 3.7 ⫾ 1.0 and 6.4 ⫾ 0.5
mm2, respectively (p ⬍ .05). regression of the intimal area
was seen in most sirolimus-treated monkeys. these results
in the first nonhuman primate model of gvd showed that
treatment with sirolimus not only halted the progression of
pre-existing gvd but was also associated with partial
regression,69 suggesting that sirolimus has the potential to
control clinical chronic allograft rejection.

side-effect profile

the renal effects of sirolimus were initially investigated in
rat.70,71 sprague-dawley rats treated with sirolimus (1.5
mg/kg intraperitoneally [ip] or 10 mg/kg po for 14 days)
exhibited neither significant functional renal impairment
nor renal histopathology. csa produced both functional
(elevated plasma urea and creatinine, enzymuria, and depressed glomerular filtration rate) and histologic alterations. in these renal studies, sirolimus peak blood levels of
79 ng/ml were reported 3 hours after an oral dose of 10
mg/kg. therefore, at doses well above established therapeutic blood levels of sirolimus, no significant renal dysfunction
was observed. in both studies, a reduction of gain in body
weight was reported in sirolimus-treated rats versus vehicletreated rats. in the spontaneously hypertensive rat (shr),
at doses proven to be therapeutic in rat allograft models
(0.01 to 0.08 mg/kg iv infusion for 2 weeks), sirolimus had
no effect on kidney function or body weight gain.72 the
salt-depleted rat model reproduces a pattern of striped
interstitial lesions observed in csa-treated patients.73 in
this model, csa caused renal lesions as well as reduced
glomerular filtration rates. sirolimus, given at 3 mg/kg po
for 14 days, had no effect on renal function or histopathology.
sirolimus has also been reported to have little or no effect
on renal parameters when administered to mice,74 rabbit,61
pig,75,76 and nonhuman primates.77 in mice, doses of up to
200 mg/kg ip were administered for 7 days. this dose, which
was 50-fold higher than the therapeutic dose for mice,
produced minor increases in blood urea nitrogen levels,
depressed body weight, and intracytoplasmic tubule vacuolization. in comparison, csa-treated mice died after 4
days of treatment with 150 mg/kg ip from apparent neurotoxicity manifested as tremors and convulsions. sirolimus-

characteristics of sirolimus

treated mice were devoid of tremors and convulsions,
suggesting that sirolimus may be less neurotoxic than csa.
in rabbits, the maximum mean trough blood level of
sirolimus was 67 ⫾ 16 ng/ml after 60 days of dosing.61 in
this group, there was a trend toward a loss in body weight
and a decrease in creatinine clearance, which did not
achieve statistical significance. this study demonstrated
that sirolimus was effective in preventing graft rejection
with a wide separation between efficacious and toxic doses
based on the projected therapeutic-dose range of 5 to 10
ng/ml. similar results were observed in the renal allograft
model in pigs, where in no specific end-organ toxicity was
noted at therapeutic doses.75,76 these studies indicated
little or no renal dysfunction with sirolimus in preclinical
models for which csa and tac were proven to be nephrotoxic.
the stimulation of sympathetic nerve activity (sna) by
csa and tac and the subsequent increase in blood
pressure was associated with their inhibition of calcineurin.78 in this study, sirolimus had no effect on sna or
blood pressure. sirolimus also was reported to have no
effect on blood pressure after semi–long-term (2-week)
administration in the salt-depleted rat model.73
cynomolgus monkeys with aortic transplants, treated po
with 2 mg/kg per day of sirolimus for 60 days (from days 45
to 105), had normal blood chemistry levels, except for
triglycerides, on day 100 posttransplant. the group treated
with sirolimus had triglyceride blood levels of 195 ⫾ 82.7
g/l versus 85.2 ⫾ 29.2 g/l (p ⬍ .001) in untreated controls.69 the increase in triglyceride levels is a significant
side-effect of sirolimus.
conclusions

since the first use of sirolimus in humans about 10 years
ago, many clinical milestones have been achieved. sirolimus
has been approved for the prophylaxis of renal transplantation in several countries. many of the expectations due to
its unique mechanism of action and the preclinical findings
are being realized in the clinic. the use of sirolimus is
accompanied by reduction in the dose of calcineurin inhibitors (csa and tac). patients receiving sirolimus and
reduced-dose calcineurin inhibitors have shown improved
renal function. the use of sirolimus-coated stents in patients is accompanied by inhibition of restenosis. sirolimuseluting stents have been approved in europe and approval
in usa is imminent. i believe that the effect of sirolimus in
the monkey model of gvd will be borne out in the clinic
with positive effects for treatment of the chronic rejection.
