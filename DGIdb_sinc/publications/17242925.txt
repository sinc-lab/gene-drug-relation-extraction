of 5-ht (6.7) and buspirone (6.4), a 5-ht1a-receptor partial
agonist, whereas its intrinsic activity was similar to that of
ziprasidone and buspirone. the stimulatory effect of aripiprazole was blocked by way-100635, a 5-ht1a-receptor
antagonist. in in vivo electrophysiology studies, aripiprazole
produced a dose-related reduction in the firing rate of 5-htcontaining dorsal raphe neurons in rats, which was both
prevented and reversed by way-100635 administration.
aripiprazole showed a high affinity for human 5-ht1a
receptors (ki =4.2 nm) using parietal cortex membrane
preparations. in membranes from cells expressing human
recombinant receptors, aripiprazole bound with high affinity
to 5-ht2a receptors (ki =3.4 nm), moderate affinity to
5-ht2c (ki =15 nm) and 5-ht7 (ki =39 nm) receptors, and
low affinity to  xxxg1119xxx  receptors (ki =214 nm) and 5-ht
transporter (ki =98 nm). in addition, aripiprazole potently
blocked 5-ht2a-receptor-mediated increases in intracellular
ca2+ levels in a rat pituitary cell line (ic50 =11 nm).
discussion these results support a partial agonist activity
for aripiprazole at 5-ht1a receptors in vitro and in vivo,
and suggest important interactions with other 5-ht-receptor
subtypes. this receptor activity profile may contribute to
the antipsychotic activity of aripiprazole in humans.

interactions with 5-ht systems in vitro and in vivo to
further clarify its pharmacologic properties.
results aripiprazole produced increases in [35s]gtpgammas binding to rat hippocampal membranes. its potency (pec50 =7.2)

chotic that demonstrates improvement of positive and
negative symptoms of schizophrenia (kane et al. 2002;
potkin et al. 2003), has a low propensity for extrapyramidal symptoms (eps), causes minimal weight gain and
sedation, and produces no elevation in serum prolactin
levels (kane et al. 2002; marder et al. 2003; potkin et al.
2003). several studies have also indicated that aripiprazole may possess an adjunctive antidepressant activity
when used together with selective serotonin (5-ht)
reuptake inhibitors for the treatment of major depressive
disorder (papakostas et al. 2005; simon and nemeroff
2005).
the mechanism of action of aripiprazole may differ
from that of current typical and atypical antipsychotics.
aripiprazole and other atypical antipsychotics interact
with a range of g-protein-coupled receptors, including
both 5-ht and dopamine receptor subtypes (davies et al.
2004). preclinical studies have provided evidence that
aripiprazole exhibits potent partial agonist activity at
dopamine d2 receptors (burris et al. 2002; inoue et al.
1996; kikuchi et al. 1995), whereas antipsychotics are
believed to exert their effects, in part, through antagonist
activity at d2 receptors (miyamoto et al. 2000).
subtypes of receptors for 5-ht, most notably 5-ht1a
and 5-ht2a receptors, were also implicated in antipsychotic
drug action (millan 2000; roth and meltzer 1995). in
particular, partial agonist activity at 5-ht1a receptors is
thought to contribute to improvements in anxiety; in
depressive, negative and cognitive symptoms; and to
decreased eps liability. the results of a recent study
(bardin et al. 2005) showed that aripiprazole-induced
catalepsy was partially reversed by pretreatment with
way-100635, a 5-ht1a-receptor antagonist, supporting
the role for 5-ht1a in the favorable eps profile of
aripiprazole. antagonist activity at 5-ht2a receptors was
also linked to positive effects on negative symptoms and
cognition, and low liability for eps.
to date, preclinical studies examining the action of
aripiprazole at 5-ht1a receptors showed partial agonist
activity at cloned human receptors (jordan et al. 2002;
shapiro et al. 2003), but have not characterized its
functional activity at 5-ht1a receptors in vivo. in
addition, pharmacological analysis of the actions of
aripiprazole at 5-ht2a and 5-ht2c receptors are incomplete, although a number of studies showed partial
agonist actions of aripiprazole at 5-ht2c receptors
(shapiro et al. 2003; zhang et al. 2006). the purpose of
this study was to define the scope of interaction of
aripiprazole with 5-ht1a and 5-ht2a receptors, using
functional in vitro binding assays and in vivo electrophysiological studies, and to provide further data on the
binding affinities of aripiprazole at other 5-ht-receptor
subtypes.

materials and methods
all studies were carried out in accordance with the guide
for the care and use of laboratory animals, as adopted by
the us national institutes of health.

haloperidol, risperidone, (+)8-oh-dpat, buspirone, 5-ht,
way-100635, tris–hcl, ethylenediaminetetra acetic acid
(edta), bovine  xxxg124xxx  (bsa), oxaloacetate/pyruvate/insulin, and polyethylenimine were purchased from
sigma-aldrich, chemical (st. louis, mo, usa). olanzapine
and ziprasidone were synthesized by otsuka pharmaceutical
company (tokushima, japan). [3h]-8-oh-dpat, [3h]- xxxd2527xxx  (lsd), [125i]-iodo-lsd, [3h]-5-ct,
[35s]-gtpgammas, and [3h]-citalopram were purchased from
nen (boston, ma, usa). [3h]-myo-inositol was purchased
from amersham pharmacia biotech (piscataway, nj, usa).
tissue culture
p11 cells were cultured in a humidified atmosphere of 10%
co2 at 37°c in high glucose dulbecco’s modified eagle’s
medium supplemented with 2 mm l-glutamine, 150 mug/ml
oxaloacetate, 50 mug/ml pyruvate, 0.2 u/ml insulin, and 10%
charcoal-treated fetal bovine serum, as described by (ivins
and molinoff 1990).
radioligand binding assays
for central 5-ht1a receptors, membrane homogenates
prepared from human parietal cortex (analytical biological services, wilmington, de, usa) were centrifuged at
20,000×g for 20 min. binding was performed in buffer
[50 mm tris–hcl (ph 7.7), 5 mm  xxxd2534xxx , 2 mm
ethylene glycol bis(2-aminoethyl ether)-n,n,n′,n′-tetraacetic acid (egta), 10 mum  xxxd2850xxx , 0.01% ascorbic
acid, and 1%  xxxd1896xxx ] and membrane homogenates (50 mug) were incubated with [3h]-8-oh-dpat
(2 nm for competition assays and 0.1–10 nm for
saturation assays) for 10 min at 37°c. nonspecific
binding was defined with 1 mum 5-ht. maximum binding
(bmax) and kd values were determined by unweighted
linear regression analysis of transformed saturation
binding data (scatchard 1949). protein concentrations
were determined by the method of protein–dye binding
with bsa as a standard (bradford 1976). we assumed that
all curves were of normal steepness; thus, values for ki
were determined using ic50 values, determined by competition for the binding of [3h]-8-oh-dpat (cheng and
prusoff 1973).

psychopharmacology (2007) 190:373–382

for 5-ht2a receptors, p11 cells were homogenized and
centrifuged at 32,000×g for 30 min. pellets were resuspended in buffer [50 mm tris (ph 7.5) at 26°c and 1 mm
edta], homogenized, and centrifuged again at 32,000×g
for 30 min. binding of [125i]-iodo-lsd was performed in
buffer [50 mm tris–hcl (ph 7.5), 1 mm mgcl2, and
10 mum  xxxd2850xxx ]. homogenates (15–20 mug protein) were
incubated with [125i]-iodo-lsd (0.5 nm) for 1 h at 37°c.
nonspecific binding was defined with 100 mum 5-ht.
for  xxxg1119xxx  receptors, transfected hela-e6-1 cells were
transferred from plates, homogenized, and centrifuged at
30,000×g for 20 min. binding of [3h]-lsd was performed
in buffer [50 mm tris (ph 7.4), 2 mm mgcl2, 200 mum
 xxxd228xxx , and 0.04% bsa] and homogenates (5 mug
protein) were incubated with [3h]-lsd for 60 min at 37°c.
nonspecific binding was defined with 10 mum clozapine.
for 5-ht7 receptors, transfected chinese hamster ovary
(cho) cells were homogenized and centrifuged at
30,000×g for 20 min. binding of [3h]-5-ct was performed
in buffer [50 mm n-(2-hydroxyethyl)-piperazine-n1-2ethanesulforic acid, 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazineethanesulfonic acid (hepes) (ph 7.4), 2.5 mm mgcl2, and 2 mm
egta] and homogenates (15 mug protein) were incubated
with [3h]-5-ct for 60 min at 25°c. nonspecific binding
was defined with 10 mum 5-ht.
for 5-ht transporter binding assays, transfected cho
cells were homogenized and centrifuged at 18,000×g for
10 min. binding of [3h]-citalopram was performed in
buffer [50 mm tris (ph 7.4), 120 mm nacl, and 5 mm
kcl] and homogenates (20 mug protein) were incubated with
[3h]-citalopram for 60 min at 25°c. nonspecific binding
was defined with 10 mum fluoxetine.
competition binding assays with human recombinant
5-ht2a and 5-ht2c receptors were performed by cerep
(celle l’evescault, france) using [3h]- xxxd2419xxx  and [3h]mesulergine, respectively, and membranes from transfected
cho cells. values for ki were determined using ic50
values that had been determined by the competition binding
assays (cheng and prusoff 1973).
measurement of levels of intracellular ca2+ using flipr
measurement of changes in the levels of intracellular ca2+
in p11 cells induced by 5-ht were performed as described
previously (wohlpart and molinoff 1998). changes in
levels of intracellular ca2+ were measured by monitoring
the relative change in fluorescence at 500–560 nm after
excitation at 488 nm using a fluorescent imaging plate
reader (flipr) device (molecular devices, la jolla, ca,
usa). after obtaining baseline recordings for 10 s, 5-ht
was added and data were collected at 1.6-s intervals for
96 s, followed by readings every 2 s for an additional 120 s.
antagonists were added 60 min before addition of 5-ht.

binding of [35s]-gtpgammas in rat hippocampus
male wistar rats (body weight, 275–330 g) were decapitated and their hippocampi were dissected and homogenized in 10 volumes of ice-cold buffer (50 mm tris–hcl,
1 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 mm egta, ph 7.4). the
homogenate was centrifuged (1,000×g for 5 min at 4°c)
and the resultant supernatant (s1) was removed. the
remaining pellet was resuspended in buffer, homogenized,
and centrifuged as before. this supernatant was mixed with
s1, centrifuged (11,000×g for 20 min at 4°c), and the final
membrane pellet was resuspended in buffer as reported by
bradford (1976) and stored at −80°c.
drugs were incubated for 30 min at 30°c with
hippocampal membranes (∼20 mug protein) and 445 mul
buffer (50 mm tris–hcl, 100 mm nacl, 1 mm mgcl2,
1 mm egta, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 100 mum gdp,
ph 7.4). reactions were started by the addition of 50 mul
[35s]-gtpgammas (final concentration=0.2 nm), followed by a
30-min incubation period at 30°c. reactions were terminated by rapid filtration. filters were placed in counting
vials containing liquid scintillation cocktail and radioactivity bound to the filter paper was measured 15 h later by
liquid scintillation spectroscopy.
estimates of potency, relative efficacy, and inhibitory
potency were determined by nonlinear regression analysis
using graphpad prism version 3.00 for windows (graphpad software, san diego, ca, usa).
electrophysiology studies
experiments were carried out on male sprague–dawley
rats (265–300 g, harlan olac, bicester, uk) using a 12:12
light ratio, with food and water available ad libitum. all
experiments were carried out in accordance with the uk
animals (scientific procedures) act (1986) and associated
uk home office guidelines.
animals were anesthetized with chloral hydrate
(400 mg/kg, i.p.) and mounted in a stereotaxic frame. a
lateral tail vein was cannulated for administration of
additional anesthetic (if necessary) and drug. body temperature of the animals was maintained at 36°c throughout the
experiment by means of a homeothermic heating pad
connected to a rectal probe.
glass electrodes were lowered below the brain surface.
neurons were usually recorded during electrode descents
down in the midline, with the second or third descents being
0.1 mm anterior or posterior to the first descent.
5-ht neurons were discriminated on the baseline of their
characteristic electrophysiological properties. one neuron
was recorded per animal.
spontaneous single-unit activity was followed for a
minimum period of 5 min before vehicle (water, captisol,

376

and tartaric acid) or drug administration. firing rates were
determined during the 30-s period immediately before
vehicle/drug injection and then during the last 30-s period
of the 2 min immediately after vehicle/drug administration.
no significant difference was observed between vehicle and
baseline firing rates.
at the end of each experiment, the final position of the
electrode tip was marked by iontophoretic dye ejection for
verification of electrode placement. in experiments that
were designed to assess the dose–response relationship,
after baseline measurements, aripiprazole was administered
in increasing doses (0.01, 0.1, and 1 mg/kg, i.v.). in other
experiments, way-100635 (0.1 mg/kg, i.v.) was administered to block the effect of a bolus injection of aripiprazole
(5 mg/kg, i.v.).

results
binding of aripiprazole to human 5-ht receptors
the affinity of aripiprazole for 5-ht1a receptors was
examined in tissue from human brain. in membranes from
parietal cortex, [3h]-8-oh-dpat labeled an apparent single
population of receptors with a kd value of 1.2 nm and a
density of 95 fmol/mg. the affinity of agonists (8-ohdpat and 5-ht), partial agonists (clozapine), and antagonist (way-100635) for binding was consistent with
labeling of 5-ht1a receptors (fig. 1, inset). aripiprazole

receptors was determined by
saturation binding of [3h]-8oh-dpat to membranes that
had been prepared from human
parietal cortex. kd and bmax
values were determined by fitting data to a one-site binding
isotherm. inset: ki values were

bound with high affinity (ki =4.2 nm) to 5-ht1a receptors
in human parietal cortex.
the affinity of aripiprazole for other subtypes of human
receptors for 5-ht was determined. aripiprazole bound
with high affinity to 5-ht2a receptors, with moderate
affinity to 5-ht2c and 5-ht7 receptors, and with low
affinity to  xxxg1119xxx  receptors (table 1). in addition, aripiprazole exhibited moderate affinity for the human 5-ht
transporter (table 1).
functional activity of aripiprazole at 5-ht receptors
the effects of aripiprazole and reference drugs on binding
of [35s]gtpgammas to rat hippocampal membranes were
examined. aripiprazole produced increases in binding of
[35s]gtpgammas, with a potency similar to (+)8-oh-dpat and
ziprasidone and greater than that of 5-ht and buspirone
(table 2). aripiprazole, buspirone, and ziprasidone behaved
as partial agonists with similar intrinsic activity, whereas
(+)8-oh-dpat and 5-ht were full agonists. risperidone,
olanzapine, clozapine, and way-100635 did not stimulate
an increase in binding of [35s]gtpgammas over basal levels
(table 2). however, way-100635 potently blocked, in a
concentration-dependent manner, the stimulatory effects of
aripiprazole, (+)8-oh-dpat, ziprasidone, and buspirone
(fig. 2). way-100635 potently inhibited the activity of 5ht in this assay, although way-100635 did not fully block
the stimulatory effect of 5-ht.

elevation of intracellular levels of ca2+ (wohlpart and
molinoff 1998). exposure of cells to increasing concentrations of 5-ht resulted in a threefold increase in the level
of intracellular ca2+ (fig. 3). the effect of 5-ht (1 mum)
was potently blocked by the antipsychotics risperidone,
clozapine, aripiprazole, and haloperidol, with ic50 values
being consistent with binding to rat 5-ht2a receptors
(table 3 and fig. 3).
electrophysiology studies
in one group of animals, aripiprazole (0.01–1.0 mg/kg, i.v.)
caused a dose-related inhibition of 5-ht cell firing in the
dorsal raphe nucleus (fig. 4). at the highest dose tested in
these animals (1 mg/kg, i.v.), the maximum mean inhibition
of firing was reduced to 13% of predrug levels. statistical

agonist potency (pec50) and relative efficacy (emax, maximal drug
effect on basal [35 s]gtpgammas binding expressed as a percentage
of that produced by 10 mum (+)8-oh-dpat) were estimated
by nonlinear regression analysis. nonlinear regression was also
used to estimate the inhibitory potency (pic50) of way-100635,
tested at 0.01, 0.1, 1, 10, 100, 1,000, 10,000, and 50,000 nm
against 1 mum concentrations each of 5-ht, (+)8-oh-dpat,
aripiprazole, ziprasidone, and buspirone. r2 represents the
goodness of fit between observed concentration effect data points
and nonlinear functions that were derived for each drug or drug
combination studied.

analysis of the raw data using one-way analysis of variance
revealed a significant effect of treatment (p<0.002). post
hoc analysis (dunnett’s test) revealed a statistically significant effect of 1 mg/kg (i.v.) vs predrug values.
a bolus injection of aripiprazole (5 mg/kg, i.v.) caused
a marked inhibition of 5-ht cell firing, and this effect
was completely reversed by injection of way-100635
(0.1 mg/kg, i.v.; n=2). in addition, the effect of aripiprazole
was totally abolished in animals that were treated 10 min
previously with way-100635 (fig. 5).

discussion
alterations in serotonergic neurotransmission are thought
to contribute to the pathophysiology of schizophrenia
(lieberman et al. 1998). interaction of 5-ht at its’ multiple
receptor sites was hypothesized to regulate neuronal
network activity (andrade 1998). the  xxxg1108xxx 
was recently implicated as a molecular target for the
development of improved antipsychotic drugs, as partial
agonist activity at this receptor was shown to improve
anxiety, depression, cognitive and negative symptoms, and
to decrease eps liability (millan 2000). several lines of
evidence supporting a role for the  xxxg1113xxx  in the
mechanism of action of antipsychotic drugs include the
restorative effect of 5-ht2a-receptor antagonists on nmethyl d-aspartate (nmda) antagonist disruption of
prepulse inhibition, a model of sensorimotor gating deficit
in schizophrenia (varty et al. 1999). in addition, most
second-generation antipsychotics were shown to be potent
antagonists of 5-ht2 receptors (stockmeier et al. 1993).
furthermore, indications suggest that second-generation
antipsychotics exhibiting a robust 5-ht2a-receptor antagonist affinity vs d2-receptor affinity, possess the ability to
reduce d2-receptor antagonist adverse effects, such as eps
(roth and meltzer 1995).
aripiprazole is a potent partial agonist at human
recombinant 5-ht1a receptors (jordan et al. 2002; shapiro
et al. 2003) and may possess antidepressant activity

(papakostas et al. 2005; simon and nemeroff 2005);
therefore, a functional characterization of the compound at
serotonergic receptor subtypes in vivo and in vitro was
deemed necessary. results from the present study are in
line with previous studies confirming both the binding
affinity and receptor density of the selective 5-ht1areceptor agonist [3h]-8-oh-dpat at the human parietal
cortex (o’neill et al. 1991). the affinity values of agonists
and antagonists for the site labeled by [3h]-8-oh-dpat
were consistent with binding to 5-ht1a receptors; potent
binding was observed with aripiprazole.

the present study provides further evidence for the
partial agonist activity of aripiprazole at 5-ht1a receptors.
stimulation of [35s]-gtpgammas binding in rat hippocampal
membranes by aripiprazole, as well as by ziprasidone,
buspirone, and (+)8-oh-dpat, was completely blocked by
the  xxxg1108xxx -receptor antagonist way-100635. clozapine did
not show partial agonist activity at 5-ht1a receptors,
although this activity was demonstrated in previous [35s]gtpgammas binding studies (jordan et al. 2002; newmantancredi et al. 1998). the lack of effect observed with
clozapine in the current study is thought to reflect the

studies performed in vivo also revealed the partial agonist
activity of aripiprazole at 5-ht1a receptors. 5-ht1a partial
agonists, such as buspirone and gepirone, inhibit dorsal
raphe activity via an interaction with somatodendritic
autoreceptors (blier and de montigny 1987; van der
maelen et al. 1986). these compounds display full intrinsic
activity at these receptors because of the existence of a
large receptor reserve for agonists at somatodendritic  xxxg1108xxx  receptors in the dorsal raphe nuclei (meller et al.
1990). in rats, aripiprazole produced a dose-dependent
reduction in the firing rate of 5-ht-containing dorsal raphe
neurons. in contrast to the partial agonist activity of
aripiprazole at hippocampal 5-ht1a receptors, aripiprazole

appeared to be a full agonist at 5-ht1a receptors in the
dorsal raphe. this may reflect the lack of  xxxg1108xxx 
reserve in the hippocampus compared to the raphe (meller
et al. 1990; yocca et al. 1987). aripiprazole-induced
reductions in serotonergic neuronal activity were both
prevented and reversed by the administration of way100635. these data indicate that aripiprazole-induced
inhibition of 5-ht neuronal activity is mediated by an
agonist interaction with 5-ht1a somatodendritic autoreceptors on dorsal raphe serotonergic neurons. however, it is also

ki values were determined by the method of cheng and prusoff (1973)
using ic50 values determined by competition for the binding
of [125 i]-iodo-lsd to membranes prepared from p11 cells.
ic50 values were obtained by fitting data to a one-site competitive
binding curve using graphpad prism version 3.0
(graphpad software). ic50 values were determined from
the data in fig. 3 and are the average of three experiments.

possible that some of the inhibitory effects that are produced
by aripiprazole may be mediated through neurons in the
medial prefrontal cortex. studies indicate that agonist activity
at postsynaptic 5-ht1a receptors in the medial prefrontal
cortex can inhibit the neuronal activity of serotonergic dorsal
raphe neurons via a long feedback loop (ceci et al. 1994;
hajos et al. 1999). a partial agonist action of aripiprazole at
5-ht2c receptors was also reported (shapiro et al. 2003;
zhang et al. 2006).
aripiprazole binds with high affinity to human 5-ht2a
receptors (mcquade et al. 2002; shapiro et al. 2003).
consistent with antagonist activity at 5-ht2a receptors,
aripiprazole, as well as the antipsychotics clozapine,
risperidone, and haloperidol, blocked 5-ht2a-receptormediated increases in levels of intracellular ca2+ in a
pituitary cell line in the present study. antagonist actions of
aripiprazole at 5-ht2a receptors in c6 glioma and gf62
cells were also demonstrated (shapiro et al. 2003).
furthermore, aripiprazole blocks head twitches in mice that
are elicited by 5-meo-n,n-dmt, an agonist at 5-ht2
receptors (hirose et al. 2004).
serotonergic neurons modulate the activity of other
neurotransmitter systems, including the dopaminergic system. serotonergic neurons in the dorsal raphe nuclei
provide major input to the frontal cortex and the striatum.
agonist activity at 5-ht1a autoreceptors located on these
neurons reduces release of 5-ht, resulting in dopaminergic
activation of the frontal cortex (millan 2000). agonistic
functionality of aripiprazole at 5-ht1a autoreceptors may
increase cortical dopamine pathway activity, which may
improve negative symptoms and cognitive functioning.
5-ht1a-receptor agonists (autoreceptor) increase adrenergic
activity in the frontal cortex, which may also play an

important role in improving cognition. furthermore, partial
5-ht1a-receptor agonists may act as functional antagonists
at postsynaptic 5-ht1a receptors. antagonist activity at
postsynaptic 5-ht1a receptors was associated with anxiolytic activity and improvements in cognitive functioning
(millan 2000). of interest, a recent preclinical study
showed the neuroprotective effects of 5-ht1a agonism by
aripiprazole (cosi et al. 2005). this neuroprotective action
may contribute to the novel mode of action of aripiprazole.
antagonist activity at 5-ht2a receptors was suggested to
increase dopaminergic transmission in neurons that project
into the striatum, thereby counteracting atypical (d2receptor antagonists) antipsychotic decreases (meltzer
1999). furthermore, agonist activity at 5-ht1a autoreceptors on the dorsal raphe nuclei increases dopamine release
in the striatum (lieberman et al. 1998). therefore, partial
agonist activity at d2 and 5-ht1a receptors, in addition to
antagonist activity at 5-ht2a receptors, may act to maintain
dopaminergic activity in the nigrostriatal pathway, thereby
contributing to the low risk of eps that is seen with
aripiprazole treatment (marder et al. 2003).
it should be noted that aripiprazole is the first d2receptor partial agonist that was shown to have clinical
efficacy in both acute and long-term studies. while
exhibiting marked potency at d2, 5-ht1a, and 5-ht2a
receptors, aripiprazole also displays moderate-to-high
affinity for several human cloned biogenic amine gprotein-coupled receptors, most notably h1 (ki =25 nm)
and alpha1a-adrenergic (ki =26 nm) receptors (see davies et al.
2004 for review). the novel mechanism of action of
aripiprazole supported by the present findings is one that
combines d2- and 5-ht1a-receptor partial agonist activity
with 5-ht2a-receptor antagonist actions. this mechanism

may be predictive of broad therapeutic use beyond schizophrenia to the treatment of affective disorders, such as acute
bipolar mania (keck et al. 2003).
