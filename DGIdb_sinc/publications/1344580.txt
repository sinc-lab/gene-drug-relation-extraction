summary. the mechanism of thrombosis following intravariceal injection of  xxxd3221xxx 
( xxxd3221xxx .) was investigated with respect to effects on
the vascular endothelium, the coagulation cascade,
and platelet function. using an umbilical cord model
designed to simulate blood flow over the endothelium,
it was found that  xxxd3221xxx . is a potent toxin for endothelial cells in that brief exposure to even low concentrations of the agent were effective in stripping endothelium over a considerable distance, exposing highly
thrombogenic endothelium in the process. effects on
coagulation and platelet function were found to be dependent on concentration. diluted  xxxd3221xxx . induced a
hypercoagulable state, possibly in consequence of a
selective inhibition of the physiological anticoagulant,
protein c, and promoted platelet aggregation. higher
concentrations inactivated the coagulation cascade
and lysed platelets completely. these results suggest
that intravariceal infusion of  xxxd3221xxx . at considerable
dilution may be at least as effective in inducing thrombosis as standard dosage, and possibly more so.

key words: sclerotherapy - thrombosis - endothelium - coagulation

sclerotherapy of esophageal varices was first described 50 years ago [3]. it is currently being used not
only for actively bleeding varices or varices which
have bled [14], but also more recently as a prophylactic measure for patients who have not yet bled [12].
controversy exists in the literature as to its exact
mechanism of action, and particularly as to how, in the
acute stage, it causes thrombosis. some authors have

offprint requests to: b.f. jacobson

claimed that the inflammatory response is the mechanism while others have shown that hypercoagulable
states may be induced [7, 10]. undoubtedly variation
occurs depending on which agent is used and whether
it is administered by intravariceal or paravariceal injection.
in the present study we have investigated the impact of various concentrations of sodium tetradecyl
sulphate ( xxxd3221xxx .) on vascular endothelium, on the coagulation cascade, and on platelet function. these
studies were carried out in an attempt to rationalize
the dosage of  xxxd3221xxx . by intravariceal injection.

materials and methods

coagulation profile
whole fresh citrated blood was obtained from healthy volunteers.
the following parameters were evaluated as baseline levels and after
addition of between 10  xxxd1919xxx  and 350  xxxd1919xxx  of  xxxd3221xxx .: prothrombin time
(s); partial thromboplastin time (ptt) (s); thrombin time; fibrinogen; factors ii, v, vii, viii, ix, x, xi, and xii, and protein c
(using kits supplied by boehringer diagnostics).
statistical analysis was performed with the appropriate analysis
of variance at the 0.05 level of significance with the help of tukey's
studentized range [8].

thromboelastography (teg)
the thromboelastogram was used to evaluate whole blood coagulation after addition of 10  xxxd1919xxx  to 100/xl of  xxxd3221xxx .

platelet aggregation
platelet aggregometry was performed after addition of between 10/xl
and 150/xl of  xxxd3221xxx . to platelets from healthy volunteers. the platelets were also tested with routine agonists. time-sequence phasecontrast light microscopy was also performed with addition of 100/zl
 xxxd3221xxx . to a counting chamber containing platelets.

the cords were sectioned at 1-cm intervals and then fixed in
gluteraldehyde and submitted for light microscopy as well as for
scanning and transmission electron microscopy. the light microscopy specimens were also subjected to factor viii staining, using
standard methods [9].

the validity of investigating endothelial function by using endothelium from umbilical veins has been established by jaffe et al. [5]. in
the present study umbilical cords were used as a model of  xxxd3221xxx .induced endothelial cell damage. umbilical cords were obtained immediately after the second stage of delivery. all cords were from
patients who did not have fetal distress, and the cords were trimmed
to remove damage caused by clamps.
the umbilical vein was cannulated with a no. 23 jelco catheter
and the vein was then perfused for 2 min with normal saline at a
constant pressure of 30 cm h:o to emulate venous flow.
cord lengths varied from 12 cm to 20 cm. one milliliter of the
sclerosant ( xxxd3221xxx .) was injected. the concentrations injected were
3% mass/volume (undiluted), 1/10 dilution, and 1/100 dilution. all
experiments were triplicated to determine reproducibility. the veins
were then reperfused with normal saline for 5 rain. the experiment
was repeated using whole blood as the perfusant to establish
whether binding of the sclerosant to blood would alter the effect on
the 1:10 dilution of  xxxd3221xxx .

none of the other factors was significantly reduced.

thromboelastography
the thromboelastogram provides a dynamic visual interpretation of clotting [2]. an example of the normal
baseline teg is shown in fig. 2.

the r time. this is the equivalent to the recalcification
time and is measured as the time taken from addition
of calcium to the point where the teg registers initiation of fibrin formation. as the teg is more sensitive
than the visual method, the r time is considerably
shorter. figure 2 shows that on addition of small dosages of  xxxd3221xxx ., the r time was shortened. this shortening was present at dosages of 25/~1 to 30 ~1 and was
indicative of a hypercoagulable state. however, at
amounts greater than 30 ~1, the r time increased and
the blood was hypocoagulable. at dosages greater
than 45/~1 the blood was incoagulable.

the k time. the k time is measured as the time from
the point where there is a deflection on the teg to the
time where the deflection measures 10 ram. this is
representative of rapidity of clot buildup. the k time
was shortened at small dosages, again representing a
hypercoagulable state. at dosages greater than 30 t~l
the blood was hypocoagulable.
the maximal amplitude. this measurement is the
maximal deflection on the teg and is representative
of the clot stability as well as elasticity.  xxxd3221xxx . addition in small dosages caused a reduction in the maximum amplitude (ma) and was indicative of an unstable
clot. this occurred despite a shortening of both the r
and k times. there was a further reduction in the ma
with increasing dosages of  xxxd3221xxx .
platelet aggregation
to demonstrate that the platelets were functioning
normally, platelets were first shown to aggregate to the

normal agonists, viz. adp, ristocetin, adrenaline, and

elicit any response. however, the platelets aggregated
when exposed to 25 /xl and 50 /xl of  xxxd3221xxx ., while
addition of 100/xl of  xxxd3221xxx . caused platelet aggregation followed by disaggregation. addition of 150 /xl
caused complete platelet lysis (fig. 3).

platelet microscopy
time-sequence phase-contrast light microscopy revealed three phases: initially the platelets were isolated in suspension (fig. 4a). as the concentration of
the sclerosant increased, platelet aggregation became
visible (fig. 4b). when the concentration exceeded a
critical level the platelets dissaggregated and were
lysed by the  xxxd3221xxx . (fig. 4c).

endothelium
sections showed complete destruction of the endothelial layer for the entire length of vein with the undiluted
sclerosant. a 1/10 dilution limited the extent of the
total denudement to 8 cm. the extent of the damage
was similar when whole blood was substituted as the
perfusant. the 1/100 dilution caused no damage. figure 5a shows the effect of perfusion of normal saline
for 5 min and is the control. the endothelium is intact.
the endothelium and subendothelium were shown to
bind factor viii antibody. figure 5b shows the effect
of the perfusion of 1/10 dilution at 6 cm.
the endothelium is completely destroyed and all
that remains is amorphous subendothelium. this was
confirmed on transmission electron microscopy.

discussion

in this study, the effects of various concentrations of
 xxxd3221xxx . on coagulation function, platelets, and endothelium have been studied. with respect to coagulation function, international normalized ratio (inr) and
ptt were significantly deranged after exposure to a
relatively high concentration of  xxxd3221xxx . these findings
are in keeping with previous work [6]. the relatively
low dosages produced little effect on the ptt and the
inr and the coagulation proteins. there was, however, a significant decrease in the protein c levels.
protein c is a  xxxd3522xxx -dependent anticoagulant that
not only inhibits coagulation by inactivating factors v
and viii but also stimulates fibrinolysis by activating
tissue plasminogen activator. the  xxxd3221xxx .-induced effects on these parameters would be synergistic in generating a hypercoagulable state, which is recognized as
being difficult to identify on routine screening, even in
patients with congenital protein c deficiency [1]. thus,
the ptt and inr are not shortened. thromboelastography was used because of its theoretical ability to
demonstrate hypercoagulable states [2]. the thromboelastogram showed that addition of low dosages of
 xxxd3221xxx . to whole blood results in a hypercoagulable
state with an unstable clot. high dosages caused a
hypocoagulable state. this is further evidence that the
low concentration might be more effective in contributing to thrombosis.
platelets not only play a crucial role in formation of
the initial "plug" but also contribute to the coagulum
as a whole [15]. the sclerosant has the ability to act as
a primary agonist and induce platelets to aggregate.
however, this occurs only in a narrow range of concentration. previous work has suggested that lysis
which the sclerosant causes on red blood cells could
induce this effect [13]. we have shown, however, that

the sclerosant acts directly on the platelets. the mechanism of action is probably due to destruction of a
small proportion of the platelets which then release
their intracellular contents and thus cause the platelets
to aggregate.
the umbilical vein model which we used confirmed
that endothelium is damaged directly by the sclerosant, exposing highly thrombogenic factor viii-rich
subendothelium in the process. the higher doses of
 xxxd3221xxx . used were specifically designed to emulate, as
far as possible, the conditions precisely at the point of
injection of standard dosage  xxxd3221xxx . the model's major
role has been to quantify the extent of damage which
occurs at specific concentrations.
while generalizations concerning rate and direction of flow in varices are not possible [11], it is nevertheless self-evident that in whatever direction (prograde or retrograde) or at whatever rate flow occurs,
the concentration of an agent injected into a varix is
initially maximal at the point of injection. with the
inflow of fresh blood, mixing occurs, generating a gradient of progressively diminishing concentrations as
the bolus moves downstream.  xxxd3159xxx  is desirable to
focus maximum thrombogenecity as close as possible
to the site of injection.
it is of interest that even tenfold-diluted  xxxd3221xxx .
destroyed endothelium over a considerable distance, 8
cm, in our model. moreover, the hypercoagulability
and enhanced platelet aggregability induced by dilute
 xxxd3221xxx . would be synergistic with the exposure of subendothelium in generating thrombosis close to the site
of injection. with standard dosage  xxxd3221xxx ., the inhibitory or destructive effects on coagulation and platelets
would be antagonistic. the result would be a less focussed clot, probably occurring excessively far downstream. indeed, autopsy studies have shown that adverse downstream effects do occur following standard
dosage  xxxd3221xxx . [4].
in conclusion, we suggest that appreciably diluted
 xxxd3221xxx . may be an effective therapeutic modality in the
treatment of esophageal varices.
