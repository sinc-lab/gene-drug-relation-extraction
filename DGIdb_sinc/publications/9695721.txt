disposition and immunodynamics of  xxxd286xxx  in liver allograft recipients.  a randomized, open-label prospective study was conducted with recipients of primary cadaveric liver allografts to characterize the disposition and immunodynamics of  xxxd286xxx , an  xxxg1174xxx , alpha-chain chimeric monoclonal antibody for immunoprophylaxis of acute rejection. patients received a total intravenous dose of 40 mg  xxxd286xxx  in addition to baseline dual immunosuppression consisting of cyclosporine (inn, ciclosporin) and steroids. the central distribution volume was 5.6 +/- 1.7 l with a steady-state volume of 7.5 +/- 2.5 l. it was cleared slowly with a total body clearance of 75 +/- 24 ml/hr and an elimination half-life of 4.1 +/- 2.1 days.  xxxd286xxx  was measurable in drained ascites fluid, and clearance by this route was an average of 20% of total clearance. total body clearance correlated positively with volume of postoperative blood loss (r = 0.5253, p = 0.0101), suggesting that bleeding may represent an additional route of drug removal. a threshold relation was observed between serum concentration of  xxxd286xxx  and cd25 expression on t lymphocytes whereby complete saturation of  xxxg1174xxx  alpha-chain was maintained as long as serum concentrations exceeded 0.1 microgram/ml. the duration of receptor saturation was 23 +/- 7 days after transplantation (range, 13 to 41 days).
