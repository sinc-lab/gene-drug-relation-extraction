the possible effect of  xxxd3255xxx ; 5- xxxd153xxx , and acetyl-5, xxxd153xxx  on
endogenous  xxxd208xxx  release and metabolism was studied in human polymorphonudear leukocytes (pmns). a new in vitro assay was used by which [1-14c]araehidonic acid is
incorporated by purified peripheral pmns until steady state was obtained (5 hr). after
preincubation with the test drugs prior to activation with calcium ionophore a23187, the
released e&osanoids were isolated by extraction and thin-layer chromatography (tlc) and
quantitated by autoradiography and laser densilometry. median drug concentrations needed
for 50% inhibition of leukotriene b4 and 5-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (5-hete) release was
4-5 mm (range 1-9 mm) for both  xxxd3255xxx  and 5- xxxd153xxx . the acetylated
derivative of 5- xxxd153xxx  was ineffective.
the present data suggest that inhibition of  xxxd208xxx  lipoxygenation may be an
essential action of  xxxd3255xxx  and its active metabolite, 5- xxxd153xxx . interference with lipoxygenase enzymes, rather than a steroid-like inhibition of arachidonic
acid release from intracellular phospholipids, seems to be the mode of action.

prescribed agent for the treatment of chronic inflammatory bowel disease (cibd) (1). whereas its
therapeutic effects have long been recognized (2-4)
the actual mode of action remains obscure (5). only
a small portion of an ingested dose is absorbed from
the small intestine. the bulk of saz reaches the
colon where bacteria reduce the azo bond, leading
to formation of 5- xxxd153xxx  ( xxxd2579xxx ) and
sulfapyridine (6). clinical studies suggest that
 xxxd2579xxx  is the therapeutically active moiety of saz,
whereas the other part of the molecule,
sulfapyridine, is inert in this context (7, 8) and is
responsible for some of the adverse effects of saz

(9-11). degradation of  xxxd2579xxx  mainly occurs by
irreversible acetylation to ac- xxxd2579xxx , probably in
the liver (12).
mucosal production of  xxxd208xxx  (aa)
metabolites, both through the cyclooxygenase pathway, ie, prostanoids, and through the lipoxygenase
pathways, ie, leukotrienes (lts) and hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids (hetes), is increased in patients
with cibd (13-18), indicating a possible role in the
pathogenesis. nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs
(nsaids), such as indomethacin, aspirin, and
 xxxd2141xxx , known as potent inhibitors of the
prostaglandin synthesis, failed to be beneficial in
ulcerative colitis (uc) (19-21) and may even provoke exacerbation (22).
the effect of saz,  xxxd2579xxx , and ac- xxxd2579xxx  has
been investigated using a soybean lipoxygenase
assay (23, 24) and in a study of drug effects on
exogenous [1-14c]aa metabolism with activated
human neutrophils as the source of lipoxygenases
(25). a previous study (26) with human neutrophils
revealed that calcium ionophore a23187 stimulates
both the release of aa from intracellular phospholipids and its metabolism through the lipoxygenase
pathway to ltb4 and 5-hete. these two
proinflammatory metabolites were identified by
cochromatography with pure standards on tlc and
by high-pressure liquid chromatography (26).
the aim of the present work was to investigate
the effect of saz and its main metabolites,  xxxd2579xxx 
and ac- xxxd2579xxx , by a physiologic in vitro assay.

materials and methods
drugs. stock solutions of saz (pharmacia inc., uppsala, sweden),  xxxd2579xxx , and ac- xxxd2579xxx  (ferring inc.,
copenhagen, denmark) were prepared in gey's solution
shortly before use. the radiolabeled and washed neutrophils were incubated with serial dilutions of saz (0,1-10
ram),  xxxd2579xxx , and ac- xxxd2579xxx  (0.1-20 ram) prior to activation with a23187. to check the influence of increased
osmolarity, controls were included using gey's solution
with mannitol (40 mm).
cell isolation. venous blood (edta 10mm) was obtained from healthy volunteers who had taken no drugs,
including aspirin, for at least four weeks. the leukocytes
were isolated by a modification of the method described
by b6yum (27): (1) erythrocytes were sedimented for 45
min at 20~ c with  xxxd2609xxx  (0.8%); (2) the "buffy
coat" leukocytes were washed twice in gey's solution
with  xxxd100xxx  (2%); (3) mononuclear leukocytes
and thrombocytes were separated from neutrophils by
gradient centrifugation using lymfoprep | (nygaard &
co., oslo, norway); and (4) contaminating erythrocytes
were removed by hypotonic lysis with  xxxg2020xxx  (0.2%).

578

isolated pmns (more than 97% purity, median recovery 44%) were washed twice and resuspended in the
culture medium rpmi 1640 with hepes buffer (25 mm)
and glutamine (2 ram) under 5% carbon dioxide.
arachidonie acid metabolism: pmns were incubated
with [1-14c]aa (37 x 103 becquerel (bq)/5 x 106 pmns,
2.2 x 10 9 bq/mmol, amersham international, buckinghamshire, u.k.) for 5 hr at 37~ c to obtain steady state
for labeling of intracellular pools of aa (26), and excess
aa was removed by washing. saz or one of its metabolites was then added to the cells for 15 rain prior to
stimulation with calcium ionophore a23187 (calbiochem,
la jolla, california) (10 ~zm, 15 min). isolation of extracellular radiolabeled metabolites was performed by centrifugation (8 x 103g, 1 rain) of the cells through dibuthyl
phthalate-dinonyl phthalate, 3:1 (density 1.033 g/ml), and
extraction according to the method of folch et al. (28).
the radioactive metabolites were separated by tlc
and quantitated by autoradiography and laser densitometry as previously described (26).
reversibility. in a separate series of six experiments,
the reversibility of drug effects was assessed by incubating radiolabeled pmns with 4 mm of either saz or
 xxxd2579xxx  for 15 min. one half of the aliquots was then
challenged with a23187 (10 ~zm, 15 min), whereas the
other half was washed three times in gey's medium
before challenge.
influence of pmns on sult'asalazine. to investigate
whether activated pmns were capable of reducing the
azo bond in saz, eight vials with pmns (5 x 10 6
pmns/ml) in gey's medium were incubated with saz (2
mm) for 20 min followed by either addition of methanol
(final concentration 50%) to stop the incubation, or addition of a23187 (10 ~m, 15 rain) and then methanol (50%).
after addition of saz,  xxxd2579xxx , and sulfapyridine standards (1 and 5 txg), 20 ~1 of the final reaction mixture was
applied to silica-gel coated tlc plates (60f254, merck
catalog no. 5715, darmstadt, f.r.g.). chromatography
was carried out in the solvent mixture of chloroform-acetone- xxxd2154xxx  (60:30:5). the tlc plates
were inspected in uv light (254 and 360 nm) for conversion of saz, after spraying with a nonspecific coloring
agent, tddm.
results
in a preliminary series of experiments, preincubation for 15 min with the test drugs before
challenge with calcium ionophore was found to
yield maximum inhibition (figure 1). both saz and
 xxxd2579xxx  inhibited the synthesis and release of 5hete and ltb4 in a dose-dependent fashion,
whereas ac- xxxd2579xxx  showed no inhibitory effect in
the concentration range up to 20 mm (figure 2).
drug concentrations needed for 50% inhibition of
ltb4 and 5-hete release, ie, expressing 5lipoxygenase activity, were calculated for both saz
and  xxxd2579xxx  (table 1) in the 10 individual experiments. median values ranged between 3.5 mm and

both pure cell suspensions and cells preincubated

a steroid-like inhibitory effect on the aa release

the inhibition of the 5-1ipoxygenase pathway by
both saz and  xxxd2579xxx  (4 mm) was demonstrated to
be dependent on presence of free drug in the
medium, since the inhibition disappeared after
washing of the pmns (table 3). neither activated
nor nonactivated pmns were capable of reducing
the azo bond in saz (detection limit 23% conversion).
no toxicity of the drugs for the pmns was
revealed, as assessed by trypan blue exclusion, and
increased osmolarity of the medium had no effect
on aa release and metabolism, as shown by testing
with mannitol.

interfere with aa metabolism in vivo and in vitro
(23-25, 29). thus steroids stimulate the production
of endogenous phospholipase inhibitors (29),
whereas both saz and  xxxd2579xxx  in vitro (25, 30) and
 xxxd2579xxx  in vivo (18) inhibit the synthesis of lts and
prostaglandins.
in a study with human neutrophils, stenson and
lobos (25) demonstrated inhibition of ltb4 and
5-hete biosynthesis by saz when activated cells
were exposed to extracellular aa. interpretation of
these results is difficult, since aa is released from
membrane-bound phospholipids and converted by
intracellular enzymes in the activated neutrophil.
the physiologic reaction was measured in the present study. both saz and  xxxd2579xxx  were shown to
inhibit the two main 5-1ipoxygenase products of aa
in neutrophils, ltb4 and 5-hete, in a dose-dependent fashion. concentrations needed for this inhibition were calculated to be in the lower part of the
therapeutic range obtained in the colon of patients
treated with conventional doses of saz and  xxxd2579xxx 
for cibd (31-33). even the lowest concentration of
 xxxd2579xxx  found in the feces of uc patients (2 mm)
causes significant inhibition of the aa metabolism
in pmns. it is possible that this is a special example
of a general phenomenon, since it has recently been
published that  xxxd2579xxx  also suppresses short-chain
fatty acid oxidation (34).
furthermore, our study demonstrated that total
radioactivity released was unaffected by the two
drugs, indicating a lack of effect on the phospholipase systems (35). the degradation product, ac-5asa did not modify the release or metabolism of
aa. the lack of effect of ac- xxxd2579xxx  on a a metabolism is in accordance with the absence of clinical
effect of this compound (36), but contrasts with the
report by allgayer et al. (23), who found a potency
of this compound similar to that of  xxxd2579xxx  as
assessed by inhibition of soybean lipoxygenase activity.
580

the fact that saz elicits inhibition of aa metabolism in pmns is difficult to understand since
uncleaved saz in patients with ileitis alone seems
to be without any convincing effect by clinical
evaluation (4). a mean concentration of saz of
about 0.1 mm in the rectum in saz-treated cibd
patients (33) makes it highly unlikely, our results
taken into consideration, that this compound is
responsible for the antiinflammatory action in this
situation, but saz administered as enema might
give higher concentrations for a while---until splitting of the azo bondmwhich possibly could be of
importance for its effect (7). in the small bowel, on
the contrary, the saz concentration is many times
higher, since 85% of an ingested dose is recovered
as unsplit saz in ileostomy effluents (37). accordingly, saz should be inhibitory in the small bowel
in patients with crohn's disease. a possible explanation of the lack of effect in vivo could be that
5-1ipoxygenase inhibition itseff is not solely responsible for the antiinflammatory properties, but that
other factors, ie, the newly reported radical scavenger effect of  xxxd2579xxx  which is not found for saz or
ac- xxxd2579xxx  (38), are more essential for the modulation of the inflammatory reaction seen in cibd.
the effects of saz and  xxxd2579xxx  are reversed by
washing the cells, suggesting that the inhibition is
not caused by a toxic effect. a described significant
inhibition of chemotaxis remaining in saz-treated
pmns after washing three times (39) was not confirmed in our assay.
the results contradict observations published by
stenson and lobos (25), who suggested that saz
inhibited at the level of lipoxygenase, whereas the
selective inhibition of the ltb4 synthesis by  xxxd2579xxx 
suggested inhibition of leukotriene a synthetase
exclusively. their use of unlabeled neutrophils and
exogenous [14c]aa as substrate, together with a
lower ionophore concentration, may account for
this discrepancy.
in conclusion,  xxxd2579xxx  and saz inhibited the
bioformation and release of 5-hete and ltb4 at
similar levels of concentration.  xxxd2579xxx  had an ic50
within the range of the therapeutic concentrations
found in the distal part of the intestinal lumen
(feces) during peroral saz treatment. inhibition of
the synthesis of the potent inflammatory mediators,
ltb4 and 5-hete, may be the principal antiinflammatory effect of saz and  xxxd2579xxx  in cibd, but the
possibility exists that other factors too, such as the
influence of  xxxd2579xxx  on the oxidative metabolism by
a radical scavenger mechanism, may be important
