the enzyme  xxxg943xxx  ( xxxg943xxx ) is involved in the cellular detoxiﬁcation of peroxides. to test
for the consequences of gpx deﬁciency in astrocytes,
astrocyte-rich primary cultures from wild-type and
 xxxg943xxx -deﬁcient [ xxxg943xxx (–/–)] mice were exposed to h2o2.
in  xxxg943xxx (–/–) astrocytes, the clearance rate of h2o2 was
slower than in wild-type cells. in contrast to  xxxg943xxx -deﬁcient astrocytes, wild-type cells exhibited, within 2 min
of h2o2 application, a rapid and transient accumulation
of cellular glutathione disulﬁde that amounted to 60%
of total glutathione. the peroxide treatment did not
affect the viability of wild-type astrocytes, whereas
45% of the  xxxg943xxx (–/–) cells died within 8 hr. however,
the viability of both types of astrocytes was strongly
compromised by lowering cellular glutathione content
before peroxide application. in contrast, inactivation of
catalase caused substantial cell death only in  xxxg943xxx (–/–)
cells but not in wild-type astrocytes. the cell death
observed was prevented by the iron chelators  xxxd1824xxx , 1,10-phenathroline, or 2,20 -dipyridyl, whereas
preincubation with ferric ammonium citrate increased
the toxicity of peroxide treatments. these results demonstrate that  xxxg943xxx  contributes to the rapid clearance
of h2o2 by mouse astrocytes and that both  xxxg943xxx  and
a high concentration of glutathione are required to protect these cells from iron-dependent peroxide damage. vc 2006 wiley-liss, inc.
key words: glutathione; iron; oxidative stress; peroxide; radicals

aerobic metabolism continuously generates reactive
oxygen species (ros) which have to be detoxiﬁed to
prevent cellular components from being damaged. for
example, the mitochondrial respiratory chain produces as
byproduct superoxide, which is quickly disproportionated to h2o2 and oxygen by superoxide dismutases
(sods). h2o2 itself is not particularly damaging, if present in physiological micromolar concentrations. how' 2006 wiley-liss, inc.

ever, h2o2 has to be removed to prevent the formation
of highly reactive hydroxyl radicals by the iron-catalyzed
fenton reaction (halliwell, 2001).
glutathione peroxidase(s) (gpx) and catalase are
known to contribute to the cellular disposal of h2o2. in
the reaction catalyzed by gpx, the tripeptide glutathione
(gsh) serves as electron donor to reduce h2o2 to h2o
(dringen et al., 2005). in addition to h2o2, gpx also
reduces  xxxd2298xxx  to the corresponding
alcohols. the various isoforms of selenium-containing
gpx differ in their substrate speciﬁcity (ursini et al.,
1995; brigelius-flohe, 1999), cytosolic  xxxg943xxx  being the
predominantly expressed isoform (ho et al., 1997; de
haan et al., 1998; lei and cheng, 2005). mice that are
deﬁcient in this enzyme [ xxxg943xxx (–/–)] are viable and fertile (ho et al., 1997; de haan et al., 1998), although
they are more vulnerable to oxidative stress (de haan
et al., 1998).  xxxg943xxx  appears to be very important for the
antioxidative defense of brain cells, insofar as results from
several experimental stress paradigms have demonstrated
that the brains of  xxxg943xxx -deﬁcient mice are more extensively damaged than those of wild-type mice (zhang
et al., 2000; crack et al., 2001; flentjar et al., 2002). in
addition, neurons cultured from  xxxg943xxx (–/–) mice have
been reported to be more vulnerable than wild-type cells
to h2o2 (de haan et al., 1998; taylor et al., 2005) and
amyloid-b peptide (crack et al., 2006).
in addition to gpx, the peroxisomal enzyme catalase contributes to the cellular detoxiﬁcation of h2o2.

 xxxg943xxx  and peroxide detoxiﬁcation by astrocytes

and o2. catalase is a diffusion-controlled enzyme and is
especially effective when clearance of high concentrations of h2o2 is required (aebi, 1984). although the
speciﬁc activity of catalase is two orders of magnitude
lower in brain than in kidney or liver (ho et al., 1997),
it is, nonetheless, involved in the detoxiﬁcation of h2o2
by brain cells (dringen and hamprecht, 1997; dringen
et al., 1999; baud et al., 2004; liddell et al., 2004).
among the differerent types of brain cells, the
detoxiﬁcation of h2o2 has been studied most extensively for cultured rat astrocytes (for overview see dringen et al., 2005). h2o2 disappears from the medium of
these cultures in a reaction following ﬁrst-order kinetics,
with half-times in the minute range (dringen and hamprecht, 1997; dringen et al., 1998). both the gsh system and catalase participate in h2o2 clearance by cultured rat astrocytes (dringen and hamprecht, 1997; liddell et al., 2004). however, the contribution of an
individual gpx isoform in h2o2 disposal and in protection of astrocytes against h2o2 toxicity has not been
reported so far.
the present study investigates h2o2 detoxiﬁcation
and peroxide toxicity in mouse astrocytes. for this species, the availability of a genetically altered  xxxg943xxx -deﬁcient mouse line allows the direct testing of the contribution of  xxxg943xxx  in the detoxiﬁcation of h2o2. here we
show that astrocytes from  xxxg943xxx -deﬁcient mice dispose
of exogenous h2o2 more slowly than wild-type cells. in
contrast to wild-type astrocytes,  xxxg943xxx -deﬁcient cells do
not accumulate  xxxd2811xxx  after peroxide application. moreover, we show that  xxxg943xxx -deﬁcient astrocytes are more
vulnerable to h2o2-induced damage than wild-type cells
and that chelatable iron mediates the cellular damage in
astrocytes following peroxide exposure.

ture dishes and 96-well microtiter plates were from nunc and
greiner bio-one (germany).
cell cultures
primary astrocyte cultures derived from the brains of
newborn wild-type (c57-black-6) mice or c57-black-6gpx1(–/–) mice (de haan et al., 1998) were prepared and
maintained as described elsewhere (hamprecht and löfﬂer,
1985). the cells were seeded in 24-well dishes (300,000 viable
cells in 1 ml) and incubated in culture medium (90% dmem,
10% fcs, 100 u/ml  xxxd2871xxx , and 100 lg/ml streptomycin sulfate) in the humidiﬁed atmosphere of a hereaus incubator with 10% co2. the medium was renewed every seventh
day. the cultures were used for experiments at an age between
15 and 21 days.
experimental incubations of astrocytes
to assess the relative contributions of gsh and catalase
to peroxide clearance and subsequent toxicity, wild-type and
 xxxg943xxx (–/–) astrocyte cultures were preincubated for 24 hr
with 1 ml dmem or with 1 ml dmem containing the gsh
synthesis inhibitor bso (1 mm). if additional inhibition of
catalase was required, the catalase inhibitor  xxxd1427xxx  (10 mm) was
present for the ﬁnal 2 hr of the incubation. the role of iron
in peroxide clearance and toxicity was investigated by preincubating cells with the iron-containing compound fac
(100 lm) or the iron chelator dfx (1 mm) for the ﬁnal 2 hr
of the 24-hr preincubation period. after preincubations, the
cultures were washed with 2 ml of incubation buffer (20 mm
hepes, 145 mm nacl, 1.8 mm cacl2, 5.4 mm kcl,
1 mm mgcl2, 0.8 mm na2hpo4, 5 mm glucose, ph 7.4)
and incubated in 500 ll incubation buffer containing 100 lm
h2o2 for 60 min in the absence or the presence of the lipophilic iron chelators phen and dp, or their respective nonchelating analogs 4,7-phenanthroline and 4,40 -dipyridyl, at a
concentration of 100 lm. after this peroxide exposure, the
cells were washed twice with 1 ml dmem and incubated for
up to 24 hr in 1 ml dmem.
monitoring of the extracellular concentration of h2o2
during the peroxide incubation, the extracellular concentration of h2o2 was monitored by the colorimetric
method described previously (dringen et al., 1998). brieﬂy,
cells were placed on an aluminium grid touching the surface
of the water of a 378c water bath. at the time points indicated, 10 ll of peroxide-containing incubation buffer, collected after gentle swirling of the dish, were added to 170 ll
of 25 mm h2so4 in a well of a microtiter plate. forty-ﬁve
minutes after the further addition of 180 ll reaction mixture
[0.5 mm (nh4)2fe(so4)2, 200 mm sorbitol, and 200 lm xylenol orange in 25 mm h2so4], the absorbance at 550 nm
was determined by using a microtiter plate reader (multiskan
ascent; thermo labsystem, helsinki, finland) and compared
with the absorbance of known standard concentrations of
h2o2. the increase in absorbance of the complex generated
is proportional to the peroxide content in the range of 0–
2.5 nmol peroxide/well of the microtiter plate (dringen et al.,
1998).

determination of glutathione content
after preincubation, and during peroxide incubation,
the glutathione contents of wild-type and  xxxg943xxx (–/–) cells
were determined by the microtiter plate assay described previously (dringen and hamprecht, 1996), using a modiﬁcation
of the photometric method originally described by tietze
(1969). brieﬂy, the cultures were washed with 2 ml ice-cold
phosphate-buffered saline (pbs; 10 mm potassium phosphate
buffer, ph 7.4, containing 150 mm nacl) and lysed with
0.5 ml sulfosalicylic acid [1% (w/v)] on ice. the lysates were
quantitatively collected and centrifuged (1 min, 15,000g)
before aliquot parts of the supernatants were taken for measuring the content of total glutathione (gsx; amount of gsh
plus two times the amount of  xxxd2811xxx ) and  xxxd2811xxx . gsx was
determined by diluting 10-ll aliquots of the lysate supernatant
with 90 ll h2o and following the rate of thionitrobenzoate
production colorimetrically at 405 nm after the addition of
100 ll reaction mixture (400 lm nadph, 300 lm dtnb,
and 0.2 u  xxxg981xxx  in 100 mm sodium phosphate buffer, ph 7.5, containing 1 mm edta).  xxxd2811xxx  was
determined as described above, with the exception that 130-ll
aliquots of the lysate supernatant were neutralized with
200 mm  xxxd3449xxx  and incubated for 1 hr with 5 ll of the
gsh-derivatizing agent 2-vinylpyridine (grifﬁth, 1980). twentymicroliter aliquots of this mixture were combined with 80 ll
h2o and 100 ll reaction mixture, and the increase in absorbance
at 405 nm was measured.
quantitation of cellular iron content
the cellular content of iron in astrocyte cultures was
determined by the colorimetric method recently described
(riemer et al., 2004). brieﬂy, the cells were washed twice
with 2 ml of pbs, dry frozen, and stored at –208c. for iron
quantiﬁcation, cells were lysed by application to each well of
200 ll 50 mm naoh, 200 ll 10 mm hcl, and 200 ll of
iron-releasing reagent (a freshly mixed solution of equal volumes of 1.4 m hcl and 285 mm kmno4 in h2o). the
dishes were incubated for 2 hr at 608c, after which 60 ll of
the detection reagent (6.5 mm ferrozine, 6.5 mm neocuproine, 2.5 m ammonium acetate, and 1 m  xxxd228xxx 
dissolved in water) was added. after further incubation for
30 min at room temperature, 280 ll of the mixture was transferred into a well of a microtiter plate and its absorbance
measured at 550 nm and compared with the absorbance of
equally treated fecl3 standards. the intracellular iron concentration determined for the well was normalized against the
protein content of replicate wells.
determination of cell viability
cell viability was analyzed by determining the activity
of lactate dehydrogenase (ldh) in the incubation medium
using the microtiter plate assay described previously (dringen
et al., 1998). brieﬂy, 20 ll of the incubation medium was collected before and after a given incubation, and each of these
samples was added to 160 ll 80 mm tris/hcl buffer, ph
7.2, containing 200 mm nacl in a well of a microtiter plate.
after addition of 180 ll reaction mixture (80 mm tris/hcl
buffer, ph 7.2, containing 200 mm nacl, 3.2 mm pyruvate,

was measured at room temperature with the microtiter plate
reader. the ldh activity in an aliquot of the incubation medium was compared with the ldh activity obtained after
completely lysing the cells in medium containing 1% (w/v)
triton x-100.
determination of protein content
the protein content per well of a 24-well dish was
quantiﬁed after solubilization of the cells in naoh (hirrlinger
et al., 1999) according to the method described by lowry
et al. (1951), using bsa as a standard.
presentation of data
unless otherwise indicated, the experiments shown were
performed in triplicate on three independently prepared wildtype cultures and on four independently prepared cultures of
 xxxg943xxx (–/–) astrocytes. the results shown are presented as
mean 6 sd of all wells. statistical analysis was by student’s
t-tests or anova, followed by bonferroni’s post hoc tests.
p > 0.05 was considered nonsigniﬁcant.

wild-type and  xxxg943xxx (/) astrocytes were pre-incubated for 24 hr in dmem (control) or dmem containing 1 mm bso. when indicated,  xxxd1427xxx 
(10 mm) was present for the ﬁnal 2 hr of pre-incubation. cells were then incubated in 500 ll incubation buffer containing 100 lm h2o2. the disappearance of the peroxide was followed and half-times were calculated from the semi-logarithmic decline of h2o2 from the buffer during the ﬁrst
8 min of incubation. d values are equivalent to the inverse protein content (in mg) multiplied by the inverse half-time (in min). protein was determined from identically treated replicate wells. data represent means 6 sd from the indicated number of samples from 3 or 4 independently prepared

values are represented by *when p < 0.05 and ***when p < 0.001.

astrocytes, respectively, revealed no signiﬁcant difference: 91
6 13 (wild-type) and 97 6 13 [ xxxg943xxx (–/–)] lg per well.
clearance of exogenous  xxxd2298xxx  by
cultured mouse astrocytes
the capacity of astrocytes to dispose of exogenous
h2o2 (100 lm ¼ 50 nmol/0.5 ml) was investigated by
measuring the decline in peroxide concentration in the
incubation buffer. in the absence of cells, h2o2 is stable
for at least 1 hr (dringen et al., 1998, 1999), but, in cultures from both cell types, the peroxide quickly disappeared from the incubation buffer (fig. 1). there were
no obvious changes in cell morphology and no decline
in cell viability or protein content per well during h2o2
exposure for 60 min (data not shown). the disposal of
peroxides followed ﬁrst-order kinetics (data not shown),
so h2o2 half-times in the presence of the different astrocyte cultures could be calculated. with a half-time of
8.7 6 2.6 min, the clearance of the peroxide by
 xxxg943xxx (–/–) astrocytes was signiﬁcantly slower than that
of wild-type astrocytes (4.8 6 1.6 min; table i).
the rate of peroxide disposal was normalized to
the protein content of the wells by calculating the speciﬁc h2o2 detoxiﬁcation rate constant [d ¼ 1/(halftime in min 3 initial protein content in mg)]. d is proportional to the capacity of cells to detoxify a peroxide
(dringen et al., 1999). the higher the d value, the better the capacity of the cultured cells to dispose of the
peroxide. the speciﬁc detoxiﬁcation rate constant d of
wild-type astrocytes was twice that of  xxxg943xxx (–/–) astrocytes for h2o2 (table i), indicating that  xxxg943xxx  strongly
contributes to the detoxiﬁcation of the peroxide. indeed,
determination of gsx and  xxxd2811xxx  during h2o2 exposure
found that wild-type cells exhibit a rapid, although transient, accumulation of intracellular  xxxd2811xxx , from hardly
detectable levels before peroxide incubation to 60%
of gsx within 2 min of peroxide exposure (fig. 2). by
15 min, the initial high ratio of gsh to  xxxd2811xxx  had
almost been restored (fig. 2). in contrast, there was no
detectable accumulation in the  xxxd2811xxx  content of gpx1journal of neuroscience research doi 10.1002/jnr

cyte cultures were preincubated with the gsh synthesis
inhibitor bso and/or the catalase inhibitor  xxxd1427xxx . treatment of astrocytes with 10 mm  xxxd1427xxx  completely inhibits
catalase activity (dringen and hamprecht, 1997). after
24 hr of preincubation with bso, the normally high
gsh content of both culture types (45.3 6 5.5 and
47.3 6 5.2 nmol gsx per milligram protein in wildtype and  xxxg943xxx (–/–) astrocytes, respectively) was
depleted by about 90% (table ii). however, for both
cell types, this depletion only mildly retarded peroxide
clearance (fig. 1). in contrast, catalase inhibition with
 xxxd1427xxx , though only weakly affecting h2o2 clearance by
wild-type cells (fig. 1a), impaired the clearance of
h2o2 by  xxxg943xxx (–/–) cells (fig. 1b), with a 2.5-fold
increase in half-time and a corresponding decrease in the
d value (table i). although either inhibitor alone did
not signiﬁcantly alter peroxide disposal by wild-type
cells, combined treatment with both inhibitors caused a
threefold increase in the half-time of h2o2 (table i).

peroxide clearance by  xxxg943xxx -deﬁcient cells was also further retarded following a combined treatment with bso
and  xxxd1427xxx  (fig. 1, table i).

viability of cultured mouse astrocytes
following peroxide exposure
to examine the toxicity of h2o2, extracellular
ldh activity was measured in cultured astrocytes that
had been exposed to the peroxide, washed, and then
incubated for up to 24 hr. wild-type astrocytes
remained viable for 24 hr (fig. 3a), whereas in gpx1deﬁcient cultures the extracellular ldh reached 45% of
initial cellular ldh activity within 8 hr (fig. 3a). preincubation with bso resulted in a substantial amount of
cell loss in wild-type astrocytes 8 hr after peroxide exposure, and cell death in  xxxg943xxx (–/–) cells was further increased compared with controls (fig. 3b).

catalase inhibition by preincubation with  xxxd1427xxx  had
no signiﬁcant effect on the toxicity of h2o2 to wildtype astrocytes but caused substantial cell death to
 xxxg943xxx (–/–) cells as indicated by the more rapid and more
extensive increase in extracellular ldh activity (compare
fig. 3a and c). this difference indicates that catalase
and the gsh system provide dual antioxidant protection
from h2o2. this hypothesis is further illustrated by the
fact that the rate of peroxide disposal by wild-type astrocytes was signiﬁcantly retarded only when both bso
and  xxxd1427xxx  were applied (fig. 1, table i). furthermore,
cell loss in wild-type astrocytes was maximal when both
bso and  xxxd1427xxx  were applied, as shown by the signiﬁcantly elevated extracellular ldh activity just 2 hr following h2o2 incubation, reaching 67% of initial cellular
ldh activity after 8 hr (fig. 3d).
involvement of iron in hydrogen
peroxide-induced toxicity of astrocytes
iron chelators were used to test whether cellular
iron contributes to the toxicity of h2o2. in addition to
journal of neuroscience research doi 10.1002/jnr

the weakly cell-permeant dfx, we used the lipophilic
and freely cell-permeant iron chelators 1,10-phenanthroline (phen) and 2,20 -dipyridyl (dp) as well as their
nonchelating analogs 4,7-phenanthroline and 4,40 -dipyridyl as controls (rauen et al., 1999). treatment of either
cell type with these compounds did not affect the disposal of h2o2 or elevate the extracellular activity of
ldh (data not shown). however, for all conditions
investigated, dfx, phen, and dp almost completely
protected wild-type and  xxxg943xxx (–/–) astrocytes against
the toxicity normally observed after h2o2 exposure
(table iii). in contrast, the nonchelating analogs 4,7phenanthroline and 4,40 -dipyridyl did not substantially
improve survival of the cells (table iii).
to investigate further the possibility that iron
mediates peroxide toxicity, astrocytes from both mouse
lines were preincubated with fac to increase their intracellular iron stores. untreated wild-type and gpx1deﬁcient astrocytes were found to contain low amounts
of iron (2.7 6 0.6 and 2.2 6 0.4 nmol iron per milligram protein, respectively; table iv), but the cells in
both culture types rapidly accumulated iron when incu-

bated for 2 hr with 100 lm fac. cellular iron levels
increased in both types of astrocytes by about sevenfold
to almost identical levels of about 17 nmol iron per
milligram protein (table iv).
the rate of peroxide clearance was not affected by
the increased intracellular iron concentrations (data not
shown). however, cell viability following fac preincubation plus h2o2 exposure was strongly compromised in
both types of astrocyte. already 2 hr after h2o2 treatment, the extracellular ldh activity had increased from
5% to 30% in wild-type cells and from 14% to 42% in
 xxxg943xxx -deﬁcient astrocytes (fig. 4a). while preincubation
with  xxxd1427xxx  or bso strongly elevated fac-induced cell
death in both types of astrocytes (fig. 4b,c), the already
substantial cell death following peroxide exposure of cells
treated with both bso and  xxxd1427xxx  was not further exacerbated in  xxxg943xxx -deﬁcient cells by preincubation with
fac (fig. 4d).

isoform. under unstressed conditions, there was no obvious
difference between astrocytes cultured from wild-type or
 xxxg943xxx -deﬁcient mice. however, when  xxxg943xxx (–/–) astrocytes were stressed by exposure to h2o2, substantial differences became evident. astrocytes lacking  xxxg943xxx  disposed of
h2o2 more slowly and were more susceptible to its toxicity. the prominent involvement of  xxxg943xxx  in h2o2 clearance of mouse astrocytes was demonstrated by 1) the
increased half-time of h2o2 and the lower d values of
 xxxg943xxx (–/–) astrocytes compared with wild-type cells for all
conditions used, 2) the absence of a transient  xxxd2811xxx  accumulation in  xxxg943xxx (–/–) astrocytes after exposure to h2o2,
and 3) the absence of an additonal reduction in peroxide
clearance rate after lowering cellular gsh concentration by
bso. the latter ﬁnding suggests that other gsh-dependent processes in addition to  xxxg943xxx  activity are unlikely to
contribute to the rapid clearance of h2o2 by mouse astrocytes. catalase inhibition only mildly retarded h2o2 clearance by wild-type cells but substantially slowed the clearance by  xxxg943xxx -deﬁcient cells. these data demonstrate that
catalase is predominantly responsible for h2o2 clearance in
astrocytes that have a compromised gsh system, either
through lack of  xxxg943xxx  activity or through a lowered availability of gsh.
catalase-independent h2o2 disposal can be studied
after preincubation of astrocytes with  xxxd1427xxx  (dringen and
hamprecht, 1997). comparison of the d values of 3attreated astrocytes from the two mouse lines investigated
revealed that  xxxg943xxx  is responsible for about 70% of the
catalase-independent h2o2 clearance. the residual 30%

discussion
cultured primary mouse astrocytes were used to
test for the importance of  xxxg943xxx  in the detoxiﬁcation of
h2o2. the present study is the ﬁrst to report on the rate
of h2o2 clearance by mouse astrocytes. the data
obtained demonstrate that, in wild-type mouse astrocytes, both systems of h2o2 clearance can functionally
replace each other and are able to compensate for the
inhibition of the other when clearing h2o2.  xxxg943xxx (–/–)

 xxxg943xxx  and peroxide detoxiﬁcation by astrocytes

of the speciﬁc h2o2 clearance rate observed for catalaseinhibited  xxxg943xxx (–/–) astrocytes suggests that, in addition
to catalase and  xxxg943xxx , other mechanisms contribute to
h2o2 detoxiﬁcation in astrocytes. other gpx isoforms
besides  xxxg943xxx  may contribute to the residual h2o2 clearance. among the selenium-dependent gpx isoforms
known to date,  xxxg943xxx , pgpx, and phospholipid hydroperoxide gpx ( xxxg946xxx ) have been observed in the brain
(brigelius-flohe, 1999). in addition, a nonselenium-dependent  xxxg946xxx  has been found in the brain (power
et al., 2002). however, insofar as the lowered gsh content of bso- plus  xxxd1427xxx -treated  xxxg943xxx (–/–) astrocytes did
not greatly slow h2o2 clearance further, gsh-dependent processes are unlikely to contribute substantially to
the residual h2o2 clearance observed under such conditions. low-molecular-weight antioxidants, or metabolites
such as pyruvate (desagher et al., 1997), are more likely
to play a role in removing h2o2 in astrocytes, particularly if both catalase and the gsh system are compromised.
after h2o2 application,  xxxd2811xxx  was found to accumulate rapidly in wild-type mouse astrocytes. this accumulation was not observed in  xxxg943xxx (–/–) astrocytes, suggesting that  xxxg943xxx  is responsible for the transient accumulation of  xxxd2811xxx  in astrocytes during h2o2 exposure.
the reason for  xxxd2811xxx  accumulation in h2o2-exposed
astrocytes is most likely that  xxxg981xxx 
becomes rate limiting for gsh redox recycling (dringen
and hamprecht, 1997), if  xxxg943xxx  generates large amounts
of  xxxd2811xxx  during h2o2 reduction. the lack of detectable
 xxxd2811xxx  in h2o2-treated  xxxg943xxx -deﬁcient astrocytes does
not exclude the possibility that  xxxd2811xxx  is produced, albeit
at a reduced rate, as a result of reactions catalyzed by
gpx isoforms other than  xxxg943xxx  or oxidation of gsh
by ros. however, the low concentrations of  xxxd2811xxx 
formed in such reactions would immediately be reduced
to gsh by  xxxg981xxx , preventing a detectable accumulation of  xxxd2811xxx  and a shift in the thiol reduction potential.
wild-type mouse astrocytes are remarkably resistant
to h2o2-induced toxicity, whereas  xxxg943xxx (–/–) astrocytes
are substantially damaged during peroxide exposure as
indicated by the compromised viability following h2o2
exposure. these data demonstrate that wild-type astrocytes are sufﬁciently equipped with antioxidative defense
mechanisms to withstand the applied peroxide stress and
that  xxxg943xxx  substantially contributes to these mechanisms.
these observations are in line with previous reports
showing that cultured neurons from  xxxg943xxx (–/–) mice are
more vulnerable than wild-type cells to h2o2 exposure
(de haan et al., 1998; taylor et al., 2005) and b-amyloid peptide exposure (crack et al., 2006).
compromised h2o2 clearance substantially increased the vulnerability of astrocytes from both mouse
lines. gsh depletion but not catalase inhibition resulted
in substantial cell death in wild-type astrocytes, even
though both treatments resulted in similar rates of h2o2
clearance. a reason for this discrepancy could be that
gsh can scavenge radicals independently of peroxide

585

clearance, whereas catalase can only inactivate h2o2.
thus, the toxicity of h2o2 may be more closely associated with the subsequent production of radicals than
with its direct toxicity.
in the presence of iron, h2o2 can form highly reactive hydroxyl radicals, and it is these radicals that have
been implicated in the peroxide-mediated damage of
brain cells (halliwell, 2001). iron chelators such as dfx
(abe and saito, 1998; robb and connor, 1998; ying
et al., 1999; goldstein et al., 2003; liddell et al., 2004)
and phen (goldstein et al., 2003) afford protection from
oxidative stress, whereas dp alleviates damage in models of ischemia (oubidar et al., 1994; demougeot
et al., 2004). the present study has shown that all of
these iron chelators protect cultured astrocytes from
h2o2-induced toxicity, and the nonchelating analogs
of the lipophilic chelators phen and dp provide at
best little protection. even if the peroxide clearing mechanisms were maximally compromised by pretreatment of  xxxg943xxx (–/–) astrocytes with bso plus  xxxd1427xxx ,
each of the three chelators rescued the cells almost
completely, strongly suggesting that iron-mediated radical formation is responsible for the observed death of
astrocytes after h2o2 application.
this hypothesis is strengthened by our ﬁndings on
the toxicity of h2o2 to iron-treated astrocytes. preincubation of mouse astrocytes with fac caused a rapid
accumulation of iron in the cells that is most likely mediated by a transferrin-independent mechanism (riemer
et al., 2004). because up-regulation of ferritin synthesis
is slower than iron accumulation (hoepken et al.,
2004), a 2-hr preincubation of astrocytes with fac will
increase the redox active pool of iron that can contribute to radical formation. indeed, pretreatment of astrocytes with fac did cause intracellular radical formation
(hoepken et al., 2004) and increased the toxicity of
h2o2, supporting the view that an iron-mediated process is involved in peroxide toxicity. this damage most
likely is due to the reactions of hydroxyl radicals that
are formed in the reduction of h2o2 by  xxxd2385xxx  in
the fenton reaction. the ferric iron produced in this
reaction can be reduced again to  xxxd2385xxx  by cellular
compounds, such as ascorbate or superoxide. thus, effective removal of superoxide and h2o2 as well as safe
storage of iron in redox-inactive form is required to
prevent generation of the highly reactive and damaging
hydroxyl radicals.
in summary, we have demonstrated that  xxxg943xxx  is
an important antioxidative enzyme in mouse astrocytes.
under unstressed conditions,  xxxg943xxx  appears to be dispensible, yet, under peroxide-induced stress, it is evident
that the enzyme, along with catalase, is required for
rapid clearance of h2o2. the gsh system appears to be
more prominent in protecting astrocytes from h2o2mediated damage than catalase. moreover, iron application exacerbates this toxicity, whereas iron chelators
ameliorate it. these data show that the maintenance of
cellular defenses, particularly the gsh system, and the
safe management of redox-active iron help to preserve
