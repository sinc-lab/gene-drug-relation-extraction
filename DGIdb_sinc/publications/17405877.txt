glycine and gaba4 are the most important inhibitory neurotransmitters in the adult central nervous system. the glycine
receptors ( xxxg863xxx ) belong to the cysteine-loop family of ligandgated ion channels. the glyr is a pentameric transmembrane
protein complex, which forms an anion-selective channel. so
far five different subunits have been cloned in mammals, one ␤
subunit and four ␣ subunits (␣1–␣4) (1). each subunit is composed of a large external n-terminal domain and four transmembrane domains termed m1–m4, with the m2 transmembrane domain forming the pore of the channel (1). these
subunits can be associated in two different ways to form functional receptor channels. the homomeric receptors consist of
five ␣ subunits, whereas the heteromeric receptors are a combination of two ␣ and three ␤ subunits with the agonist-binding
site at the interface of the ␣ and the ␤ subunits (2). although the
plant alkaloid  xxxd2947xxx  (ptx) was first used to discriminate
between functional gabaars and  xxxg863xxx , it is now well established that ptx can inhibit both cation-selective ( xxxg456xxx  and 5-hydroxytryptophan receptor type 3)
and anion-selective (gabaar, gabacr, glyr, and glucl)
receptor channels (3–7). the action of ptx has been extensively studied on gabaars, on gabacrs, and on  xxxg863xxx  (see
for review 8, 9). the ptx inhibitory mechanism can vary
between ionic channel receptors of the cysteine-loop family,
and it ranges from an open channel blocker on some gabars
to an allosteric competitive antagonist on  xxxg863xxx  (8). the number of binding sites of ptx, the location of these sites, and the
inhibitory mechanism of this compound are still under debate
(8), but there are several lines of evidence to indicate that ptx
can bind within the channel pore. the 2⬘– 6⬘ amino acid residues that line the pore in the m2 domain are likely to be
involved in the ptx effect (5, 7, 10 –12) or to form the binding
site for ptx at least in ionotropic gaba receptors (13). the
proposal that the location of the ptx-binding site is within the
channel pore of  xxxg863xxx  was recently reinforced. indeed, it has
been shown that ptx can be trapped on its binding site when
the channel closes in ␣1 homomeric  xxxg863xxx  with an ␣1 subunit
r271c mutation (14). this was also the case in wild-type ␣2
homomeric  xxxg863xxx  (9).

contrary to its effect on the ␥- xxxd2177xxx  type a and c
receptors,  xxxd2947xxx  antagonism of the ␣1 homomeric glycine
receptors ( xxxg863xxx ) has been shown to be non-use-dependent and
nonselective between the  xxxd2947xxx  components picrotoxinin
and  xxxd2946xxx .  xxxd2947xxx  antagonism of the embryonic ␣2 homomeric glyr is known to be use-dependent and reflects a channel-blocking mechanism, but the selectivity of  xxxd2947xxx  antagonism of the embryonic ␣2 homomeric  xxxg863xxx  between
picrotoxinin and  xxxd2946xxx  is unknown. hence, we used the patch
clamp recording technique in the outside-out configuration to
investigate, at the single channel level, the mechanism of  xxxd2946xxx - and picrotoxinin-induced inhibition of currents, which
were evoked by the activation of ␣2 homomeric  xxxg863xxx  stably
transfected into chinese hamster ovary cells. although both
picrotoxinin and  xxxd2946xxx  inhibited glycine-evoked outside-out
currents,  xxxd2946xxx  had a 30 times higher ic50 than picrotoxinin.
 xxxd2946xxx -evoked inhibition displayed voltage dependence,
whereas picrotoxinin did not. picrotoxinin and  xxxd2946xxx 
decreased the mean open time of the channel in a concentrationdependent manner, indicating that these  xxxd2947xxx  components can bind to the receptor in its open state. when  xxxd2946xxx 
and glycine were co-applied, a large rebound current was
observed at the end of the application. this rebound current was
considerably smaller when picrotoxinin and glycine were coapplied. both  xxxd2946xxx  and picrotoxinin were unable to bind to
the unbound conformation of the receptor, but both could be
trapped at their binding site when the channel closed during
glycine dissociation. our data indicate that picrotoxinin and
 xxxd2946xxx  are not equivalent in blocking ␣2 homomeric glyr.

materials and methods
cell culture—chinese hamster ovary cells (cho-k1, atcc
number ccl61) were maintained in a 95% air, 5% co2 humidified incubator at 35 °c in dulbecco’s modified eagle’s medium
supplemented with 0.11 g/liter sodium pyruvate, 6 g/liter d-glucose, 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (all from
invitrogen). cells were passaged every 5– 6 days (up to 20
june 1, 2007 • volume 282 • number 22

times). for electrophysiological recordings, cells were seeded
onto glass coverslips coated with  xxxd2793xxx  (0.1 mg/ml).
 xxxg904xxx  ␣2 subunit cloning and transfection were performed as described previously (20).
outside-out recordings—outside-out recordings (21) were
done under direct visualization on ␣2 glyr-transfected cho
cells with the use of normaski optics (⫻40 immersion lens;
nikon optiphot). cells were continuously perfused at room
temperature (20 –22 °c) with oxygenated bathing solution (2
ml/min) containing (in mm) the following: nacl 147, kcl 2.4,
cacl2 2, mgcl2 2, hepes 10, glucose 10 (ph 7.2, osmolarity 320
mosm). patch clamp electrodes (5–10 megohms) were pulled
from thick wall borosilicate glass with an outer diameter of 1.5
mm and inner diameter of 0.86 mm (harvard apparatus, kent,
uk) in multiple steps using a brown-flaming puller (sutter
instrument co., navato). they were fire-polished and filled
with (in mm) the following : cscl 130, mgcl2 4, na2atp 4,
egta 10, hepes 10 (ph 7.2, osmolarity 290 mosm). currents
were recorded using an axopatch-1d amplifier (axon instruments, foster city, ca) and stored using a digital recorder
(pcm-r300, sony, tokyo, japan). recordings were filtered at
10 khz using an eight-pole bessel filter (frequency devices,
haverhill, ma), sampled at 50 khz and stored on a pc computer using pclamp software 6.03 (axon instruments). the
membrane potential was held at ⫺50 mv throughout the
experiment, except when examining the i-v relationship. patch
currents represent the average of several trials as further specified in the figure legends or in the text.
drug delivery—outside-out single channel currents were
evoked using a fast-flow operating system (22, 23). control and
drug solution were gravity-fed into two channels of a thin-wall
glass theta tube (2 mm outer diameter; hilgenberg, malsfeld,
germany), pulled, and broken to obtain a 200-␮m tip diameter.
the outside-out patch was positioned (45° angle) 100 ␮m away
from the theta tubing, to be close to the interface formed
between the flowing control and drug solutions. one lumen of
the theta tube was connected to reservoirs filled with solutions
containing glycine and/or blockers. the solution exchange was
performed by rapidly moving the solution interface across the
tip of the patch pipette, using a piezo-electric translator (model
p245.30, physik instrument, waldbronn, germany). concentration steps of glycine lasting 1–1000 ms were applied with an
interval of ⱖ10 s. exchange time of 10 –90% (⬍100 ␮s) was
determined before each set of experiments by monitoring the
change in the liquid junction potential evoked by the application of a 10% diluted control solution to the open tip of the
patch pipette (23). for the experiments requiring fast solution
exchange between three different conditions (see figs. 8 and 9),
we used a homemade multibarreled application system composed of three horizontally aligned quartz tubes (inside diameter 2.5 mm; outside diameter 3.5 mm; polymicro technologies). solution exchange was achieved by lateral movements,
using an sf-77b fast-step perfusion system (warner instruments, hamdell, ct). the complete solution change was
achieved in 200 –300 ␮s. glycine, ptx, picrotoxinin, and  xxxd2946xxx  were from sigma. stock solution of ptx, picrotoxinin, and
 xxxd2946xxx  was prepared in  xxxd1896xxx  (me2so) and then
diluted to an appropriate concentration with the above extrajournal of biological chemistry

in fact, ptx is an equimolecular complex of picrotoxinin and
 xxxd2946xxx  (15), which differ only by a single group, with  xxxd2946xxx 
having a hydrophilic elongated end.  xxxd2946xxx  is inactive in
inhibiting the gabaar and gabacr, indicating that the
inhibitory effect of ptx is related to picrotoxinin (15, 16). this
is not the case for ␣1 homomeric  xxxg863xxx . picrotoxinin and  xxxd2946xxx  are equally potent in inhibiting ␣1 homomeric glyr activation (17). the main structural difference in the putative ptxbinding site in gabaars or gabacrs and in ␣1 homomeric
 xxxg863xxx  is located at the 2⬘ pore-lining position. gabaars and
gabacrs contain an alanine residue instead of a glycine residue at the 2⬘ pore-lining position. this could facilitate the discrimination between the two ptx components. as the ␣2
homomeric glyr 2⬘ residues are also alanine, it is possible that
␣2 homomeric glyr could also discriminate between picrotoxinin and  xxxd2946xxx . this would imply that the blocking mechanism of ptx previously described on this glyr subtype (9)
could be mediated by picrotoxinin only.
the ␣2 homomeric glyr subunit is an embryonic receptor
form (18, 19) and plays an important role during synaptogenesis and cell differentiation. furthermore, the ␣2 homomeric
glyr has slow kinetic properties and opens mainly with a single
large conductance state (100 –120 ps) (20); this property makes
this receptor a good model for analyzing the effects of picrotoxinin and  xxxd2946xxx  on glyr kinetics. therefore, we investigated
the effectiveness of picrotoxinin and  xxxd2946xxx  in blocking the ␣2
homomeric  xxxg863xxx  and their mechanisms of inhibition of the
activation and deactivation kinetics of the ␣2 homomeric
 xxxg863xxx . the receptor was expressed in chinese hamster ovary
(cho) cells. the single glyr channel currents were recorded
using outside-out patch clamp recordings, and they were
evoked using an ultra-fast flow application system.
we showed that picrotoxinin is considerably more potent
than  xxxd2946xxx  in inhibiting ␣2 homomeric  xxxg863xxx , indicating that
the inhibitory effect of ptx we previously described (9) is
mainly because of picrotoxinin. although picrotoxinin blocks
homomeric ␣2 glyr activation in a voltage-independent manner,  xxxd2946xxx -evoked inhibition appeared to be more voltagedependent. both picrotoxinin and  xxxd2946xxx  can bind to the
receptor in both the open channel conformation and the liganded closed state. they can both be trapped at their binding site
when the channel closes during glycine molecule dissociation.
the blocking mechanism for picrotoxinin can be well predicted by the kinetic model previously proposed to describe
ptx-evoked inhibition of ␣2 homomeric glyr (9). the blocking mechanism for  xxxd2946xxx  is probably different. the kinetic
model used to predict the blocking mechanism for picrotoxinin
poorly predicted the experimental results obtained with  xxxd2946xxx . a relatively simpler kinetic model better predicted the
blocking mechanism for  xxxd2946xxx .

concentration-dependent inhibition of ␣2 homomeric glyr
by picrotoxinin and  xxxd2946xxx —we first analyzed the relative
potencies of  xxxd2946xxx  and picrotoxinin in inhibiting glyr activity in terms of the outside-out current evoked by glycine applications to outside-out patches containing ␣2 homomeric glyr
from cho cells stably expressing the ␣2 glyr subunit. fig. 1,

ptx,  xxxd2946xxx , and picrotoxinin on inward currents (holding

where i is the response in the presence of ptx; icon is the
control response (i.e. the glycine response in the absence of
ptx); ic50 is the ptx concentration at which half of the glycine
response is blocked, and nh is the hill coefficient. for each
concentration tested, the amplitude of the current, i, was measured at the steady-state level.
to determine the voltage dependence of the inhibition of
glycine-evoked currents by picrotoxinin and  xxxd2946xxx , voltage
ramps were generated using pclamp6 software from ⫺100 to
⫹100 mv to be applied to outside-out patches (vh ⫽ ⫺50 mv).
the voltage ramps (300-ms duration) were applied during the
stable phase of the glycine-evoked responses in the presence
and absence of alkaloids. a voltage ramp was applied in the
absence of drug and the elicited current was subtracted from
the current measured in the presence of drugs.
the activation time constants of glycine-evoked currents in
the presence and absence of picrotoxinin or  xxxd2946xxx  were estimated by fitting the onset of the responses with a sum of exponential curves using axograph 4.9 software. decay time constants were obtained by fitting the first 750 ms of the decay
phase with a sum of exponential curves using axograph 4.9
software (axon instruments). the presence of one or more
exponential components was tested by comparing the sums of
squared errors (sses) of the fits (23, 24).
for single channel analysis, patches with one channel were
included only if channel activity was stable over sweeps. open
and closed time durations were measured manually using axograph 4.9 software. for display purposes, open and closed time
histograms show the distributions as log intervals with the ordinate on a square root scale. these distributions were fitted with
the sum of several exponential curves. the fit was optimized
with the least square method (25). the number of exponential
components was determined by comparing the sses of the fits.
kinetic modeling programs—to obtain a kinetic model for
effects on glyr behavior, glycine-evoked currents were analyzed off-line, and the inhibitory effect of picrotoxinin and
 xxxd2946xxx  on glyr kinetics was mathematically modeled using
the chemical kinetic modeling programs included in the axograph 4.9 software package (axon instruments). this program
first calculated the change in the number of channels in each
given state for given rate constants, and then systematically
varied the rate constants to give the minimum sses between
the experimental data and a given model transient (24). outside-out responses from 12 patches evoked by the application of

lished previously (fig. 1b, gray

curves were fitted with the hill
equation (see “materials and methods”) giving an ic50 (half-maximum
inhibition) and a hill coefficient for
picrotoxinin of 2.4 ⫾ 0.2 ␮m and
0.79 ⫾ 0.05, respectively. these values were not significantly different

we previously published for ptx
(ic50 ⫽ 2.7 ⫾ 0.2 ␮m and hill coefficient ⫽ 0.8 ⫾ 0.04) (9).
when compared with picrotoxinin, the concentration-response
curve for  xxxd2946xxx  showed a
⬎30-fold higher ic50. the ic50
value and hill coefficient for  xxxd2946xxx  were 117.3 ⫾ 14.3 ␮m and 0.89 ⫾

indicate that, unlike what is
observed on gabaars,  xxxd2946xxx  can
inhibit ␣2 homomeric  xxxg863xxx . but
these two ptx components were
not equally effective in blocking ␣2
homomeric glyr, which contrasts
with ␣1 homomeric glyr (17).
according to the concentration-response curves shown in fig. 1b,

common features, as a competitivelike inhibitory mechanism on ␣2
homomeric glyr.
voltage dependence of picrotoxinin-induced inhibition and  xxxd2946xxx -induced inhibition—in our previous study (9), we showed that
ptx-induced inhibition on ␣2
homomeric glyr is not voltage-dependent. as opposed to what was
observed for ptx or picrotoxinin
inhibition (fig. 3a1), a large
rebound current was observed during glyr deactivation immediately
after the termination of co-application of ⬎30 ␮m  xxxd2946xxx  and glycine
(fig. 3a2). such a large rebound
current was described for the open
channel block effect of acetylcholine
on nicotinic receptors (26, 27). it is
therefore possible that  xxxd2946xxx 
could act as a fast open channel
blocker on ␣2 homomeric glyr. in
such a hypothesis, the inhibitory
effect of  xxxd2946xxx  might be voltagedependent, which should not be
true for picrotoxinin.
to test this hypothesis, the voltage sensitivity of the picrotoxininand  xxxd2946xxx -induced inhibition of
the glycine current was examined
at different holding potentials
(vh). typical examples of 300 ␮m
glycine-evoked currents (1-s

although 30 ␮m  xxxd2946xxx  had a lower effect than 10 ␮m picrotoxinin on the deactivation time constant of glycine-evoked
current (fig. 4), the mean open time was decreased to 2.9 ms in
the presence of 30 ␮m  xxxd2946xxx , which was lower than the
decrease observed in the presence of 10 ␮m picrotoxinin.
in control conditions, the closed time distribution was best
fitted by a single exponential curve with a closed time constant
␶c ⫽ 0.23 ms (fig. 5a3), as described previously for homomeric
␣2  xxxg863xxx  (9, 20). in the presence of picrotoxinin (10 ␮m), the
closed time distribution was best fitted by the sum of two exponential curves giving time constants of ␶c1 ⫽ 0.24 ms and ␶c2 ⫽
5.72 ms (fig.  xxxd1428xxx ), which are also very similar to the values
obtained for ptx (␶c1 ⫽ 0.23 ms and ␶c2 ⫽ 5.76 ms) (9). the
closed time distribution was also best fitted by the sum of
two exponential curves in the presence of  xxxd2946xxx  (30 ␮m)
giving ␶c1 ⫽ 0.29 ms and ␶c2 ⫽ 1.76 ms (fig. 5c3). as suggested previously (9), the longer closed time is likely to
reflect an additional recovery pathway from picrotoxinin- or
 xxxd2946xxx -evoked open channel block.
the ensemble-averaged currents obtained by averaging single channel responses (108 trials for 30 mm glycine, 117 trials in
the continuous presence of 10 ␮m picrotoxinin, and 77 trials for
30 ␮m  xxxd2946xxx ) indicated a ␶decay similar to that observed for
macroscopic glycine currents in the absence and presence of
continuous picrotoxinin or  xxxd2946xxx  (fig. 5, a1, b1, and c1,
lower parts). ␶decay was 158.8 ms for the averaged current in the
absence of blocker. it was 35.5 and 53.4 ms, respectively, for the
averaged current in the presence of continuous picrotoxinin or
in the presence of continuous  xxxd2946xxx . altogether these results
indicate that the decrease in the deactivation time constant
evoked by picrotoxinin and by  xxxd2946xxx  could mainly be due to a
decrease in the mean open time of the channel. to explain our
observation of a shorter open time constant and a longer ␶decay
in the presence of 30 ␮m  xxxd2946xxx , compared with the values
obtained in the presence of 10 ␮m picrotoxinin, one must
assume that channel reopenings occur to a larger extent during
the deactivation phase of glycine-evoked current in the presence of  xxxd2946xxx . this was indeed exemplified in fig. 5c1.
to obtain more precise information on the block mechanism
of picrotoxinin and  xxxd2946xxx , we analyzed the effect of increasing picrotoxinin or  xxxd2946xxx  concentrations on the mean open
time of the glyr channel. such analyses were also intended to
gather information about the blocking rate constants of picrotoxinin and of  xxxd2946xxx  (28). we analyzed the open time distributions in single receptor bursts of openings in response to 300
␮m concentration pulses (1 s) of glycine. opening time constants were analyzed by pooling measurements made on 8 – 61
sweeps from 1 to 3 patches. histograms of the open durations
within bursts in the absence and presence of picrotoxinin or
 xxxd2946xxx  were constructed and best fitted by single exponential
curves at all picrotoxinin or  xxxd2946xxx  concentrations tested (fig.
6). as expected, both picrotoxinin and  xxxd2946xxx  decreased the
mean open time in a concentration-dependent manner. the
mean open time for the control response was 51.7 ms (61 trials
from three patches; fig. 6a). in the presence of picrotoxinin,
the mean open time decreased to 19.6, 8.5, 2.9, and 1.0 ms for 3
␮m picrotoxinin (61 trials from two patches), 10 ␮m picrotoxinin (52 trials from two patches), 30 ␮m picrotoxinin (42 trials

simple kinetic model with several liganded closed states as
described for homomeric ␣2  xxxg863xxx  (9, 20), and in the absence of
any open channel blocker or inhibitory drugs promoting closed
states from the open state, the deactivation time constant is a
good approximation to the mean burst duration. for homomeric ␣2  xxxg863xxx , the mean burst duration during deactivation
depends on the mean open time of the channel, on the mean
closed time, on the number of openings, and on the number of
closures (see ref. 9 for detailed explanation). slow blockers
must shorten the openings on average and limit reopening of
the channel during relaxation. such slow blockers will
appear to speed up relaxation as observed previously for ptx
(9). faster blockers should evoke a biphasic relaxation (28). in
our experiments, both picrotoxinin and  xxxd2946xxx  decreased in a
concentration-dependent manner the deactivation time constant of the current evoked by a short concentration step of
glycine (fig. 4). in the experiments described above, the relaxation of currents evoked by a short concentration step of glycine in the presence of picrotoxinin or of  xxxd2946xxx  could be fitted
by a single exponential curve. this favors the hypothesis of slow
blocker-like mechanisms for both compounds. if this were true,
both picrotoxinin and  xxxd2946xxx  should decrease the mean open
time of the channel to the same extent. nevertheless, the  xxxd2946xxx  concentration must be increased 10 times to obtain an effect
similar to picrotoxinin on the deactivation time constant of the
glycine-evoked currents. accordingly, this could be achieved
either by a lower association rate for  xxxd2946xxx  than for picrotoxinin, and/or a larger number of reopenings within a burst in the
presence of  xxxd2946xxx  compared with picrotoxinin, because the
deactivation time constant reflects the mean open burst duration (28).
to determine the microscopic determinants of the decrease
in the decay time constant observed in the presence of picrotoxinin and  xxxd2946xxx , we analyzed the open time and closed time
distributions in single receptor burst of openings in response to
short (1 ms) concentration pulses of glycine near glyr saturation (30 mm) in the absence and presence of 10 ␮m picrotoxinin
or 30 ␮m  xxxd2946xxx . to perform this analysis, patches with a
single functional glyr were selected (i.e. patches that did not
display superimposed openings in response to a saturating concentration of agonist; see ref. 20). single openings and closures
were manually detected and measured using a filter cut-off frequency of 5 khz. in control conditions, glyr opens in bursts of
long openings interrupted by very short closures (fig. 5a1). in
the continuous presence of 10 ␮m picrotoxinin or 30 ␮m  xxxd2946xxx  (fig. 5, b1 and c1), the single opening duration appeared to
be shortened, but more flickering of channel openings was
observed in the presence of  xxxd2946xxx .
opening and closing time constants were estimated by pooling measurements made on single channel responses obtained
from 3 to 9 patches. the open time histograms were best fitted
by single exponential curves both in control conditions and in
the continuous presence of picrotoxinin or  xxxd2946xxx  (fig. 5, a2,
b2, and c2). in control conditions, the mean open time was 47.9
ms, which is consistent with the values we previously obtained
(9, 20). the mean open time was decreased to 9.3 ms in the
presence of 10 ␮m picrotoxinin. this was closely similar to what
we previously observed in the presence of ptx (6.1 ms) (9). but

two patches), 10 ␮m  xxxd2946xxx  (23 trials from one patch), 30 ␮m (18 trials
from two patches), and 100 ␮m
 xxxd2946xxx  (14 trials from one patch),
respectively (fig. 6, c1–c2 and d).
these results indicate that both picrotoxinin and  xxxd2946xxx  inhibition
can be related to an open channel
block mechanism (28).
to obtain an approximation of
the binding rate constants for picrotoxinin and  xxxd2946xxx , the reciprocals of the mean open times
were plotted as a function of the
picrotoxinin or  xxxd2946xxx  concentration as shown in fig. 6d. binding (kon) and closing (␣) rate constants were calculated from the
relationship 1/␶o ⫽ [p]kon ⫹ ␣
(20), where ␶o is the mean open
time, and [p] is the picrotoxinin or
 xxxd2946xxx  concentration. the linear
fit to the data gave kon and ␣ values
of 9.8 ␮m⫺1 s⫺1 and 26.2 s⫺1 for
picrotoxinin and 8.1 ␮m⫺1 s⫺1 and
26.1 s⫺1 for  xxxd2946xxx . these results
demonstrate that binding and
closing rate constants are quite
similar for picrotoxinin and  xxxd2946xxx . this further suggests that the
longer ␶decay for  xxxd2946xxx  compared with picrotoxinin can only
be explained by a larger number of
channel reopenings during the
deactivation of glycine-evoked
currents.

as shown in fig. 9a, the block evoked by  xxxd2946xxx  and its
recovery time course were faster than for picrotoxinin. in the 11
outside-out patches tested, the time course of  xxxd2946xxx  block
was best fitted by a bi-exponential curve with time constants

(30.6 ⫾ 3.8%). in these patches, the current amplitude again
increased progressively at the end of  xxxd2946xxx  application,
with a time course best fitted by a bi-exponential curve with
recovery time constants ␶rfast ⫽ 0.64 ⫾ 0.08 ms (63.9 ⫾ 5.1%)
and ␶rslow ⫽ 14.2 ⫾ 3.1 ms (36.1 ⫾ 5.1%).
if picrotoxinin or  xxxd2946xxx  bind to the unliganded receptor,
picrotoxinin or  xxxd2946xxx  preincubation should result in a
lengthening of the rise time of the glycine-evoked response.
this was not the case. when 10 ␮m picrotoxinin or 100 ␮m
 xxxd2946xxx  was applied immediately before (time interval ⬍0.1
ms) the application of a saturating concentration of glycine
(10 mm), they did not change the amplitude of the glycineevoked outside-out currents or their rising phase (figs. 8b
and 9b). the activation time constants were ␶fast ⫽ 0.50 ⫾
0.06 ms (90.4 ⫾ 4.7%) and ␶slow ⫽ 1.97 ⫾ 0.52 ms in control

2.83 ⫾ 1.25 ms with 100 ␮m  xxxd2946xxx  preincubation.
these results make it unlikely that the lengthening of the
rising phase of glycine-evoked current we observed in the continuous presence of picrotoxinin or  xxxd2946xxx  results from picrotoxinin or  xxxd2946xxx  binding to unliganded ␣2 glyr. these
results are also consistent with our study that the activation
time course of the first response evoked by glycine application
in the continuous presence of picrotoxinin or  xxxd2946xxx  was
unchanged. as suggested previously for ptx, the lengthening
of the rise time we observed for the following responses in the
continuous presence of picrotoxinin or  xxxd2946xxx  could be
explained by picrotoxinin and  xxxd2946xxx  binding to  xxxg863xxx  when
channels are open and then being trapped at their binding sites
after glycine washout.
to test this hypothesis, we used the same protocol that we
described previously for ptx (9). first, we analyzed the effect of
picrotoxinin on the activation phase of successive outside-out
currents evoked by glycine applications (10 mm) when picrotoxinin was applied during the deactivation phase of the first
response (post-treatment). we preferentially used patches with
a high glyr density to obtain a good description of the time
course of the response on a single trace. picrotoxinin was
applied during 500 ms, which corresponds to the duration of
the deactivation phase of glycine-evoked currents in control
conditions. glycine was then applied alone 60 s after picrotoxinin post-treatments and finally a last time after 10 s to determine whether the effect of picrotoxinin was reversible. as
shown in fig. 8c, post-treatment with 10 ␮m picrotoxinin
shortened the deactivation phase of the glycine-evoked current.
the current evoked by glycine alone 60 s after the end of glycine-evoked current plus picrotoxinin post-treatment had an
amplitude similar to that of control response (⬍4% decrease

phase when compared with control responses. this was related
to a significant increase in the rising time constants ␶fast and

course of the responses evoked 60 s
after picrotoxinin post-treatment

4.15 ⫾ 1.24 ms (53.6 ⫾ 7.9%) and
␶slow ⫽ 18.5 ⫾ 9.3 ms. applying glycine 10 s after the response with the

time constants similar to that of the
control (control corresponding to
the very first application) as follows:
␶fast ⫽ 0.42 ⫾ 0.05 ms (65.6 ⫾ 4.6%)
and ␶slow ⫽ 2.31 ⫾ 0.39 ms. these
results clearly indicate, as observed
previously for ptx (9), that the
effect of picrotoxinin on the rising
phase of the glycine response can
persist for up to 60 s after the washout of glycine and picrotoxinin. it is
therefore likely that picrotoxinin
can be trapped at its binding site
when the channel closes and/or
when glycine dissociates from its
binding sites.
although continuous application
of  xxxd2946xxx  also lengthened the activation phase of glycine-evoked
responses, the recovery time course
of the glycine response amplitude
observed at the end of  xxxd2946xxx 
application is considerably faster
than that observed after picrotoxinin application, suggesting a faster
dissociation rate for  xxxd2946xxx  from
its binding site. it is therefore possible that  xxxd2946xxx  cannot be trapped
when the channel closes because it
would have dissociated from its
binding site before the channel
closes. to resolve this issue we used
the same protocol as described
above for picrotoxinin.
as shown in fig. 9c, post-treatment with 100 ␮m  xxxd2946xxx  greatly

post-treatment had a less pronounced effect than picrotoxinin on
the activation time course of these
currents, the rising phase was significantly slower when compared with
control responses. this was mainly
related to a significant increase in
the slower rising time constant ␶slow
(n ⫽ 8; paired t test, p ⬍ 0.01) and to
an increase in the proportion of the
slow component (n ⫽ 8; paired t

these results clearly indicate that
 xxxd2946xxx  can also be trapped at its
binding site when the glyr channel
closes and/or when glycine dissociates from its binding sites. the lack
of effect of  xxxd2946xxx  post-treatment
on ␶fast may also suggest that the
likelihood of  xxxd2946xxx  being trapped
when the channel closes is lower
than for picrotoxinin.

inhibition—to account for the
results obtained on picrotoxinin
and  xxxd2946xxx  inhibition, we based
ourselves on the minimal markov
model previously proposed for
homomeric ␣2 glyr subtype (9).
this model has three binding sites
for glycine and three desensitization closed states and a single open
state linked to the fully liganded
closed state. each desensitization
state is linked to the mono-liganded closed state, the doubly liganded closed state, and the triply
liganded closed state, respectively.
this model is somewhat similar to
the model proposed for homomeric ␣1 glyr subtype (30),

rotoxinin (fig. 10, b and c). in these models, picrotoxinin
remains bound when glycine dissociates from its binding sites.
this was simulated by three sequential glycine-bound states
(a3pc to a2⫹apc and a⫹a2pc) linked to a glycine-unbound
state (a3 ⫹ pc). as mentioned previously for ptx (9), adding
this bound state accounts for the decrease in the deactivation
time constant of the glycine-evoked current observed when
picrotoxinin was applied during the relaxation phase (fig. 8c1).
in these models, each glycine-bound state related to the picrotoxinin-bound state (a3pc to a⫹a2pc and a2⫹apc) was
linked to a desensitization closed state (a3pd, a2⫹apd, and
a⫹a2pd), as for each glycine-bound state in the absence of
picrotoxinin (see fig. 10, b and c) (9).
the two models tested (fig. 10, b and c, model 1 and model 2)
described equally well the picrotoxinin-evoked inhibition of the
homomeric ␣2  xxxg863xxx  (9). in model 1, one step was incorporated
between the fully glycine-liganded closed state a3c and the
corresponding fully glycine-liganded block closed state a3pc.
this model supposed that picrotoxinin can dissociate from its
binding site only when the  xxxg904xxx  is fully liganded.
accordingly, this model contains one cycle scheme (fig. 10b).
model 2 is somewhat similar to the kinetic scheme recently
proposed for gabac receptors (16). in this model, ptx or
picrotoxinin can dissociate from its binding sites during all glycine-binding steps (a2⫹ac, a⫹a2c, and a3c; fig. 10c).
therefore, three steps were incorporated between glycine-liganded closed states and glycine-liganded closed states on
which picrotoxinin remains bound (a2⫹apc, a⫹a2pc, and
a3pc; fig. 10c).
to compare those two models, we fitted experimental traces
obtained by long applications of 0.3 or 30 mm glycine in the
presence of 1, 3, and 10 ␮m picrotoxinin (n ⫽ 12 patches). the
procedures used for the fit were identical to those described
previously for  xxxd2947xxx -evoked inhibition of homomeric ␣2
 xxxg863xxx  (9). all rate constants estimated with the homomeric ␣2
glyr markov model were set as fixed parameters. the association rate constant (kon) and the dissociation rate constant (koff)

rates constants, and the recovery rate constants linking the glyvolume 282 • number 22 • june 1, 2007

state is necessary to describe homomeric ␣2 glyr subtype
behavior (9, 20). before testing the markov models for picrotoxinin or  xxxd2946xxx  inhibition, it was necessary to adjust
the different rate constants of the model describing glycineevoked outside-out currents for each control trace (9). to do
so, we fitted experimental traces obtained by long application of 0.1– 0.3 and 30 mm glycine (9, 20, 31). table 1 and
table 2 summarize the averaged kinetic parameters derived
from model fitting of glycine-evoked responses. this model
predicts a glycine ec50 of 250 ␮m and a hill coefficient of 2.1,
which are in good agreement with published experimental
values (200 ␮m and 1.9) (9, 20). we then analyzed picrotoxinin or  xxxd2946xxx  inhibition responses on the same traces. the
different models tested were elaborated according to experimental data.
those data showed that ptx and picrotoxinin inhibited the
homomeric ␣2 glyr subtype in a similar way. we therefore
decided to test the two kinetic models we already proposed for
ptx (fig. 10, b and c, model 1 and model 2) on picrotoxininevoked inhibition of homomeric ␣2  xxxg863xxx . as observed for
ptx, the hill coefficient of the concentration-response curve
for picrotoxinin was close to 1. we therefore postulated that
only one molecule of picrotoxinin binds to the receptor, as also
postulated for picrotoxinin on gabac receptors (16). picrotoxinin is also likely to bind to the receptor in the open conformation because the mean open time of the channel was
decreased when picrotoxinin concentration was increased, giving an estimated association rate constant of 9.8 ␮m⫺1 s⫺1,
which is close to the association rate constant previously estimated for ptx (11.6 ␮m⫺1 s⫺1) (9). picrotoxinin had no effect
when applied immediately before glycine application (fig. 8b1),
although the activation time constants of the glycine-evoked
outside-out current was increased by picrotoxinin applied during deactivation even when glycine was applied 60 s after picrotoxinin washout (fig. 8, c1 and c2). this was also the case for
ptx (9). accordingly, picrotoxinin cannot bind directly to the
unliganded closed state of the receptor (a3⫹c). moreover, picrotoxinin must bind within the vestibule of the channel (fig. 10,
b and c, a3o to a3pb), whereas it remains trapped when the
channel closes (a3pb to a3pc) if glycine dissociates before pic-

was used for homomeric ␣2 glyr in control conditions (without picrotoxinin
or  xxxd2946xxx ). b, model 1, picrotoxinin can bind and unbind from the fully glycine-liganded closed state or from the open state of glyr. in this scheme,
picrotoxinin is trapped when glycine dissociates from the fully liganded
closed state. c, model 2, picrotoxinin can bind and unbind from all glycinebound states, but picrotoxinin is only trapped when the receptor returns to
the glycine-unbound closed state. d, model 3,  xxxd2946xxx  can bind and unbind
from the glyr open state only.  xxxd2946xxx  remains bound if continuously applied
when glycine dissociates from its binding sites. in this model, as in model 4 (e)
and model 5 (f),  xxxg863xxx  cannot further desensitize from the glycine-bound
closed states when  xxxd2946xxx  is trapped on its binding site. e, as in model 1,
model 4  xxxd2946xxx  can bind and unbind from the fully glycine-liganded closed
state or from the open state of glyr only. in this scheme,  xxxd2946xxx  is trapped
when glycine dissociates from the fully liganded closed state. f, model 5 is
identical to model 2 except that, as in models 3 and 4,  xxxg863xxx  cannot further
desensitize from the glycine-bound closed states when  xxxd2946xxx  is trapped on

cine-bound closed states plus picrotoxinin to the corresponding desensitization states (a2⫹apd, a⫹a2pd, and a3pd)
were also set as fixed parameters. all other parameters were set
as free parameters. in these two models, it was also necessary to
constrain reactions depending on the reaction cycles (one reaction cycle in model 1 and three reaction cycles in model 2) to
satisfy the principle of microscopic reversibility (29). as performed previously for  xxxd2947xxx , the association and dissociation rate constants for picrotoxinin linking the glycine-liganded
closed states with and without picrotoxinin binding (a2⫹ac to
a2⫹apc, a⫹a2c to a⫹a2pc, and a3c to a3pc) were set as
equivalent (9). model 1 and model 2 provided a good prediction
of our experimental results. as reported previously for ptx (9),
model 2 did not give a better prediction of the experimental
results. sses for these two models were not significantly different (anova test, p ⬎ 0.1), which indicates that the transitions
between a2⫹ac and a2⫹apc and between a⫹a2c and
a⫹a2pc are not necessary to describe our experimental data.
the optimal averaged rate constant values for these two models
are listed in table 1. these values were closely similar to those
obtained for ptx (9), confirming that the inhibition of ␣2
homomeric glyr by ptx is likely to be related to picrotoxinin.
for picrotoxinin the fits gave kon1p values (kon1p ⫽ 4.2 ⫾ 0.5

s⫺1 for model 1 and 278 ⫾ 69.4 ␮m⫺1 s⫺1 for model 2). this was
also the case for the dissociation rate constants values koff1p and
koff2p estimated for picrotoxinin (see table 1). for ptx,
koff1p ⫽ 46.9 ⫾ 11.9 s⫺1 for model 1 and 57.8 ⫾ 10.3 s⫺1 for
model 2 and koff2p ⫽ 749.8 ⫾ 198.3 s⫺1 for model 1 and 327.9 ⫾
83.6 s⫺1 for model 2 (9). as also observed for ptx (9), the
affinity of picrotoxinin for the glyr open state (model 1 koff1p/
kon1p ⫽ 8.21 ␮m; model 2 koff1p/kon1p ⫽ 9 ␮m) was lower than
that for the liganded closed states (model 1 koff2p/kon2p ⫽ 0.97
␮m; model 2 koff2p/kon2p ⫽ 0.93 ␮m), the dissociation constants
(koff/kon) being similar to the values obtained for ptx (model

model 1 koff2p/kon2p ⫽ 1.6 ␮m; model 2 koff2p/kon2p ⫽ 1.2

the open state equal to its affinity for the liganded closed
states, the sse of the fit became 3.9 ⫾ 0.9 times significantly

higher (anova test, p ⬍ 0.01), indicating that the rate constant values for these picrotoxinin-binding steps are unlikely
to be equivalent, as was observed previously for ptx (9), and
as also reported for picrotoxinin-evoked gabac receptors
inhibition (16). as discussed previously (9), it is likely that
the access of picrotoxinin to its binding site could be different between the glycine-bound closed state conformation
and the glycine-bound open state conformation (16). this
could be related to the various large conformational changes
of the receptor associated with agonist binding and channel
gating (16, 32).
fig. 11 shows examples of fitting experimental traces with
model 1 for responses evoked by the co-application of 30 mm
glycine and 10 ␮m picrotoxinin (fig. 11a) or of 0.3 mm glycine
and 3, 10, and 30 ␮m picrotoxinin (fig. 11b). this model well
predicts an increase in ic50 when glycine concentration was
increased (fig. 11c), a decrease in the deactivation time constant of the currents at the end of the application of glycine (fig.
11d), as well as a lengthening of the rising phase of the response
evoked by a saturating concentration of glycine when picrotoxinin was applied continuously (fig. 11, e and f). it also predicts
that picrotoxinin does not change the rise time of glycine currents when applied just before the application of glycine (not
shown). the model also accounts for the slower rising phase of
the response that follows picrotoxinin application during the
relaxation phase of the preceding response (fig. 11g). overall,
these data indicate that the same kinetic model with closely
similar rate constants can describe the inhibitory effects of both
ptx and picrotoxinin. those data also strongly suggest that
picrotoxinin is likely to be mainly responsible for the ptx
inhibitory effects previously described on homomeric ␣2  xxxg863xxx 
(9).
in inhibiting homomeric ␣2  xxxg863xxx ,  xxxd2946xxx  and picrotoxinin
share some similar properties as follows. the block evoked by
both picrotoxinin and  xxxd2946xxx  depends on glycine concentration (fig. 2). both picrotoxinin and  xxxd2946xxx  can slow down the
activation phase of the glycine-evoked current and speed up the
relaxation phase when they are applied continuously (figs. 4
and 7). their estimated association rate constant values from
the open state are closely similar (fig. 6d); they can both be
trapped at their binding site when the channel closes during
glycine dissociation.
accordingly, we first tested for  xxxd2946xxx  the kinetic model we
already proposed for picrotoxinin (fig. 10b, model 1), and we
hypothesized that  xxxd2946xxx  acts as a poor agonist on the picrotoxinin-binding site. the procedures used to test the kinetic
models for  xxxd2946xxx  were identical to those described previously
for picrotoxinin. this model (fig. 10b) overestimated the speed
of the activation time course of the response evoked by the
simultaneous application of a nonsaturating concentration of
glycine (100 –300 ␮m) and of ⬎100 ␮m  xxxd2946xxx . to help the fit
procedure, and to obtain a better resolution of the rate constants set as free variables, we decided to fit simultaneously
outside-out currents obtained, on the one hand, during the co-

concentration-dependent inhibitory effect of ptn but that model 3 does not
well predict the concentration-dependent effect of ptn on the activation
time course of glycine-evoked currents. d, model 4 also predicts the decrease
in ptn efficacy when the glycine concentration was increased. the concentration-response curves were obtained from theoretical currents generated

application of glycine and  xxxd2946xxx  and, on the other hand, during the application of glycine when  xxxd2946xxx  was continuously
applied. as shown in fig. 12b, this procedure gave a poor fit of
the experimental data; it overestimated the speed of the activation time course of the glycine response and underestimated
the decrease in the deactivation time course of the glycineevoked current when  xxxd2946xxx  was applied during the relaxation
phase of the glycine response. discarding the links between the
glycine-liganded closed states with and without  xxxd2946xxx  in
models 1 and 2 (leaving a single binding state for  xxxd2946xxx  linked
to the channel open state) did not improve the quality of the fit
(anova test, p ⬎ 0.1). adding another binding site linked to
the open state (two mutually exclusive  xxxd2946xxx -binding
sites) or linked to the  xxxd2946xxx -binding site linked to the open
state (two sequential binding sites: a3o to p⫹a3pb and
p⫹a3pb to a3p2b) did not improve the quality of the fit
(anova test, p ⬎ 0.1).
another hypothesis already proposed for ptx block on
homomeric ␣1 glyr (17) and on gabaergic chloride channels
expressed on crayfish muscle (29) proposed that ptx can promote glyr desensitization-like closed states. we tested this
hypothesis using the kinetic models shown in fig. 10, d–f
(model 3, model 4, and model 5). in those models,  xxxd2946xxx  binds
within the vestibule or the pore of the channel, which, accordingly, shortens the duration of single channel openings (a3o to
a3pb, see fig. 10, d–f). it is then trapped at its binding site
when the channel closes (a3pb to a3pc, see fig. 10, d–f).
because, as observed for picrotoxinin, recovery from  xxxd2946xxx 
block necessitates the reactivation of the receptor by glycine
application, glycine molecules might dissociate from these
desensitization-like closed states, whereas  xxxd2946xxx  remains
bound (a3pc to a⫹a2pc, a⫹a2pc to a2⫹apc, and
a2⫹apc to a3⫹pc).
two  xxxd2946xxx  block model subtypes were tested. in the first
subtype (fig. 10d, model 3), the only way for  xxxd2946xxx  to bind
and unbind passes through the open state. in the second subtype (fig. 10, e and f, models 4 and 5),  xxxd2946xxx  can bind and
unbind from the fully liganded bound state only (model 4, a3c
to a3pc) or  xxxd2946xxx  can bind and unbind from all glycinebound states (model 5, a3c to a3pc, a⫹a2c to a⫹a2pc, and
a2⫹ac to a2⫹apc). these last two models suppose that the
 xxxd2946xxx -binding site is not masked when the receptor is in its
bound closed conformation. this has already been proposed
for  xxxd2946xxx  and picrotoxinin block on homomeric ␣1 glyr (17)
and for picrotoxinin block on gabac receptors (16). for simplicity, all rate constants in model 5 linking the glycine-bound

fast doubly exponential onset of block and the fast doubly exponential recovery time course observed for  xxxd2946xxx -evoked inhibition within glycine application (fig. 9a.). simulations of a
transient application of 100 ␮m  xxxd2946xxx  during glycine-evoked

and ␶off2 ⫽ 5.03 ⫾ 0.79 ms (n ⫽ 11), which are in the range of the
values measured experimentally (fig. 9a). as also observed
with the experimental data, the relative amplitude of the fast
blocking time constant and the fast recovery time constant
greatly varied between simulations, ranging from 41.1 to 95.2%
(70.3 ⫾ 4.28%; n ⫽ 11) and from 31.9 to 98.9% (66.2 ⫾ 4.8%; n ⫽
11), respectively.
overall, those simulations indicate that model 4 is the minimal stochastic scheme that best predicts the  xxxd2946xxx  inhibitory
effect on homomeric ␣2  xxxg863xxx . moreover, it is important to
note that models 4 and 5 cannot well predict the picrotoxinin
inhibitory effect on homomeric ␣2  xxxg863xxx  when compared with
models 1 and 2. models 4 and 5 gave ⱖ4 times significantly
higher sses than models 1 or 2 (anova test, p ⬍ 0.01), indicating that picrotoxinin and  xxxd2946xxx  are unlikely to share the
same inhibitory mechanism on homomeric ␣2  xxxg863xxx .

discussion
the inhibitory mechanism of ptx on ligand-gated ion channels is known to be a complex phenomenon and varies among
ionotropic receptors (8). we have proposed previously a simple
model that well predicted the inhibitory mechanism of ptx on
wild-type homomeric ␣2  xxxg863xxx  (9). in this study, we demonstrated that picrotoxinin was considerably more potent (⬎30
times) than  xxxd2946xxx  in blocking the activity of ␣2 homomeric
 xxxg863xxx , indicating that ptx-evoked inhibition of ␣2 homomeric
glyr activity (9) is mainly mediated by picrotoxinin. the complex inhibitory mechanism of picrotoxinin can be well predicted by the simple kinetic scheme already proposed for the
inhibitory mechanism of ptx on ␣2 homomeric glyr. this
model implied that picrotoxinin binds both to the agonistbound closed state and to the agonist-bound open state. our
results also suggest that picrotoxinin and  xxxd2946xxx  probably
bind at different binding sites. the inhibitory mechanism of
 xxxd2946xxx  was also well predicted by a simple kinetic scheme in
which  xxxd2946xxx  can promote desensitized-like bound states. as
suggested for picrotoxinin,  xxxd2946xxx  cannot bind to the agonistunbound closed state, and both picrotoxinin and  xxxd2946xxx  can
be trapped at their binding sites while glycine dissociates from
the receptor.
minimal kinetic models for picrotoxinin and  xxxd2946xxx —the
models previously proposed to describe ptx-evoked glyr
inhibition (fig. 10, model 1 and model 2) (9) can also well
predict the experimental data obtained with picrotoxinin.
this was not surprising for homomeric ␣2  xxxg863xxx , because
our experimental data also indicated that picrotoxinin is
likely to be the main effective component of ptx in blocking
homomeric ␣2  xxxg863xxx  within the concentration range tested
for ptx (see fig. 1).
surprisingly,  xxxd2946xxx -evoked inhibition of homomeric ␣2
 xxxg863xxx  cannot be described by the same kinetic scheme used for

closed states with and without  xxxd2946xxx  binding were set as
equivalent (a3c to a3pc, a⫹a2c to a⫹a2pc, and a2⫹ac to
a2⫹apc), supposing that  xxxd2946xxx  affinity is similar for all glycine-bound closed states. when these reactions were set as
independent, the fit of experimental traces was not significantly
improved (anova test, p ⬎ 0.1), and the rate constant values
for these steps strongly diverged.
model 3 did not give a better prediction of our experimental
data when compared with model 2 (anova test, p ⬎ 0.1). as
shown in fig. 12c, this model failed to predict a slowdown of
the activation time course of glycine-evoked outside-out currents in the presence of ⬎100 ␮m  xxxd2946xxx .
models 4 and 5, on the other hand, better predicted our
experimental data when compared with model 2. model 4 gave
3.9 ⫾ 0.6 times and model 5 4.4 ⫾ 0.6 times significantly lower
sses than model 2 (anova test, p ⬍ 0.01). model 5 did not
significantly improve the fit when compared with model 4
(anova test, p ⬎ 0.1), which suggests that although the transitions between the monoliganded glycine-bound closed states
(a2⫹ac and a2⫹apc) and the doubly liganded glycine-bound
closed states (a⫹a2c and a⫹a2pc) could exist, they are not
really necessary to describe our experimental data. the optimal
averaged rate constant values obtained for models 4 and 5 are
listed in table 2. as shown there, the fits of experimental traces
with model 4 or model 5 gave very similar values for  xxxd2946xxx 
association and dissociation rate constants. as already
observed for the picrotoxinin block, the affinity of  xxxd2946xxx  for
the channel in the open state (for  xxxd2946xxx  and model 4 koff1p/
kon1p ⫽ 511.5 ␮m; for picrotoxinin and model 2 koff1p/kon1p ⫽
486.1 ␮m) was lower than for the glycine-bound closed state
(for  xxxd2946xxx  and model 4 koff2p/kon2p ⫽ 11.8 ␮m; for picrotoxinin and model 2 koff2p/kon2p ⫽ 3.8 ␮m). we also attempted, as
for picrotoxinin, to set the affinity of  xxxd2946xxx  for the open state
equal to its affinity for the liganded closed states. in this case,
the sse of the fit was ⬇4 times significantly higher (anova
test, p ⬍ 0.01), indicating that the rate constant values for these
 xxxd2946xxx -binding steps are unlikely to be equivalent, as was also
observed for picrotoxinin.
fig. 12 shows examples of fits of experimental traces using
model 4 (thick dark lines) to outside-out currents evoked by the
co-application of 30 mm glycine and 300 ␮m  xxxd2946xxx  (fig. 12a),
the co-application of 300 ␮m glycine and 300 ␮m  xxxd2946xxx , or the
application of 300 ␮m glycine in the continuous presence of 300
␮m  xxxd2946xxx  (fig. 12b), as well as the co-application of 300 ␮m
glycine and 10, 100, and 300 ␮m  xxxd2946xxx  (fig. 12c). this model
predicts a large rebound current at the end of the co-application of  xxxd2946xxx  occurring for  xxxd2946xxx  concentrations ⬎10 ␮m
(fig. 12c). it also predicts a  xxxd2946xxx  ic50 of 81 ␮m in the presence of 0.3 mm glycine (fig. 12d), which is in good agreement
with our experimental data (ic50 ⫽ 117 ␮m), and an increase in
 xxxd2946xxx  ic50 when glycine concentration was increased (fig.
12d). this model also predicts an acceleration of the relaxation
phase of glycine-evoked currents in the continuous presence of
 xxxd2946xxx  (fig. 12e); a slowing down of the rising phase of
responses was induced by a saturating glycine concentration
when  xxxd2946xxx  was either continuously applied (fig. 12f) or
applied during the deactivation phase of the preceding
response (fig. 12g). finally, this model also accounts for the

constant (␤ ⬇ 4935 s⫺1) of the glyr channel itself, compared
with picrotoxinin. when we attempted to set the on-rate constant (a) and the off-rate constant (b) values equal to the closing
rate constant (␣) and the opening rate constant (␤) values,
respectively, the kinetic scheme failed to describe the  xxxd2946xxx 
experimental data. accordingly, it is reasonable to conclude
that the channel does not simply close when  xxxd2946xxx  binds to
the receptor but that  xxxd2946xxx  binding specifically evokes a
change in glyr conformation leading to channel closure, but
with slower kinetics than for picrotoxinin. it is also important
to note that the off-rate constant (b) between a3pb and a3pc is
10 times higher than the on-rate constant (a) both for  xxxd2946xxx 
and picrotoxinin. accordingly,  xxxg863xxx  must remain mainly in
the blocking bound state a3pb instead of the ligand-bound
closed state a3pc during simultaneous application of glycine
plus picrotoxinin or  xxxd2946xxx .
nevertheless, the picrotoxinin and  xxxd2946xxx  kinetic models
share similarities. as mentioned previously for ptx (9), these
two groups of kinetic models differ from the model proposed
for picrotoxinin-induced inhibition of gabac receptors (16).
this is because there is an intermediate step between the picrotoxinin- or the  xxxd2946xxx -bound block state (a3pb) and the
fully ligand-bound closed state plus picrotoxinin or  xxxd2946xxx 
(a3pc). a reaction cycle with four steps in models 2, 4, and 5 is
physically plausible as discussed previously for ptx inhibition
of homomeric ␣2 glyr (9). accordingly, the receptor first
undergoes a conformational change to a new stable state when
it is fully liganded (channel opens);  xxxd2946xxx  and picrotoxinin
then bind to the open conformation, and afterward the channel
closes. the cycle is terminated when these compounds dissociate directly from the fully liganded closed conformation.
kinetic model subtypes for picrotoxinin and for  xxxd2946xxx  nicely
predict the previously described “competitive” and “noncompetitive” mechanisms of picrotoxinin and  xxxd2946xxx  action on
homomeric  xxxg863xxx  (17). in all models tested, glycine can dissociate from its binding sites, whereas picrotoxinin or  xxxd2946xxx 
remains bound. accordingly, an increase in glycine concentration will increase the glycine association rate between the glycine-bound closed states plus the ptx compounds (a⫹a2pc,
a2⫹apc, and a3pc; fig. 10); this will result in an apparently
faster recovery rate of both picrotoxinin and  xxxd2946xxx , as mentioned previously for ptx-evoked inhibition of  xxxg863xxx  (9).
different binding sites for picrotoxinin and  xxxd2946xxx ?—it is
now recognized that picrotoxinin is likely to have a binding site
lying within the channel pore between the 6⬘ and 2⬘ residues in
a variety of cys loop receptor channels (8, 13, 36). our results
using picrotoxinin are consistent with the hypothesis that there
is a picrotoxinin-binding site located within the glyr channel,
as proposed previously for ptx-evoked block of homomeric ␣2
 xxxg863xxx  (9). in our experiments,  xxxd2946xxx -evoked glyr inhibition
was more sensitive to voltage than picrotoxinin-evoked glyr
inhibition, indicating that  xxxd2946xxx  is likely to go deeper in the
electrical field of the membrane, which could also suggest that
 xxxd2946xxx  binds to a different site than picrotoxinin. other open
chloride channel blockers such as ginkgolides also evoke a
voltage-dependent inhibition in homomeric ␣1  xxxg863xxx  (37).
their binding sites are supposed to be located at the 2⬘ porelining position of the glyr channel pore. for picrotoxinin, its

picrotoxinin. consistently, this  xxxd2946xxx  kinetic scheme did not
properly fit the experimental data obtained with picrotoxinin.
it is therefore reasonable to suppose that these two alkaloids are
unlikely to share the same inhibitory mechanism for homomeric ␣2  xxxg863xxx . the  xxxd2946xxx  kinetic scheme differs from the
picrotoxinin kinetic scheme in that it was not necessary to add
desensitization states (a2⫹apd, a⫹a2pd, and a3pd) linked
to the glycine-bound closed states plus  xxxd2946xxx  (a2⫹apc,
a⫹a2pc, and a3pc) to predict our experimental data. rather,
such a kinetic model can be interpreted as  xxxd2946xxx  promoting
desensitization-like glycine-bound closed states, as suggested
previously for picrotoxinin-evoked inhibition of homomeric ␣1
 xxxg863xxx  and gabac receptors (16, 17, 29). according to models
4 and 5, it was necessary to allow these desensitization-like
closed states to interconvert when glycine dissociates (a3pc to
a⫹a2pc and a⫹a2pc to a2⫹apc) to fit our experimental
data. a glycine-unbound closed state (a3⫹pc) in the presence
of  xxxd2946xxx  had also to be included. to our knowledge, however,
such a desensitization state linked to the unbound closed state
has never been described for  xxxg863xxx  or ionotropic gaba receptors. another possible interpretation of models 4 and 5 would
be that  xxxd2946xxx  binding must stabilize the receptor channel in
an intermediate closed state conformation from which the
receptor cannot desensitize. however, both hypotheses are
equally plausible because an interaction between glyr desensitization and channel gating is likely to occur. indeed, the glyr
desensitization mechanism implies interactions between the
m1 and m2 intracellular loop and the m2 transmembrane
domain forming the channel pore of the receptor (33, 34). it is
likely that m1–m2 and m2–m3 loops act in parallel to control
channel activation by acting as hinges governing allosteric control of the m2 domain (35).
there are also some important differences when the estimated rate constant values between the kinetic schemes for
picrotoxinin and for  xxxd2946xxx  are compared. the  xxxd2946xxx  dissociation rate constant from the open state and from the glycine-bound closed state is ⬇100 times faster than the values
obtained for picrotoxinin. this indicates that the affinity of
 xxxd2946xxx  for the glyr open state is low compared with that of
picrotoxinin. this fast dissociation rate constant accounts for
the lower efficacy measured for  xxxd2946xxx , as well as for the faster
recovery time constant observed after washout of glycine and
 xxxd2946xxx  (fig. 9 and fig 12) compared with the picrotoxinin
blockade (fig. 8 and fig. 11). the  xxxd2946xxx  blockade model also
predicts a considerably slower on-rate constant (a) and off-rate
constant (b) of the transition between the  xxxd2946xxx -bound state
a3pb and the fully agonist-bound closed state plus  xxxd2946xxx 
a3pc. for picrotoxinin, the estimated transition between a3pb
and a3pc is very fast, with rate constant values ⬎108 s⫺1. such
fast rate constant values indicate that the glycine-liganded
closed state plus picrotoxinin (a3pc) and the picrotoxininbound state (a3pb) could collapse when picrotoxinin binds to
the glyr open state, as discussed previously for ptx-evoked
glyr inhibition (9). the values for the on-rate constant (a) and
the off-rate constant (b) that we obtained for  xxxd2946xxx  (model 4,
a ⬇ 1070 s⫺1; model 5, a ⬇ 264 s⫺1) and the off rate (model 4,
b ⬇ 7567 s⫺1; model 5, b ⬇ 2880 s⫺1) were closer to the ranges
of the closed rate constant (␣ ⬇ 21 s⫺1) and of the open rate

model that lacked a  xxxd2946xxx -binding step between the ligandbound closed states failed to predict the time course of the
glycine-evoked outside-out currents in the presence of  xxxd2946xxx 
(fig. 10, model 4). this was also the case for ptx and therefore
for picrotoxinin (9).
for picrotoxinin, the kinetic models predict faster association and dissociation rate constants for the ligand-bound closed
states than for the ligand-bound open state. by contrast, the
 xxxd2946xxx  kinetic models predict similar association rate constants and a slower dissociation rate constant for the ligandbound closed states than for the ligand-bound open state.
there are several possible explanations for these differences.
different association rate constant values for picrotoxinin
between the ligand-bound closed states and the open state suggest that channel openings will reduce the access to the binding
site of picrotoxinin. this is feasible if a change in receptor conformation results in a narrowed access to this binding site. a
narrowed access to the picrotoxinin-binding site could also
explain the slower rate of dissociation to the open state, as predicted by models 1 and 2. the coefficient of diffusion of an
agonist partly depends on the correspondence between the
effective radius of the drug molecule and the target on the
receptor (43). another possibility is that picrotoxinin binds to a
specific binding site when the receptor is in the ligand-bound
closed state(s) and then binds to another binding site recognized by  xxxd2946xxx  and located deeper within the channel, when
the channel is open. although feasible, this hypothesis does not
explain why the blockade of the glycine-evoked current by picrotoxinin is not voltage-dependent, in contrast to picrotinevoked inhibition.
the highly similar slow association rate constants of
 xxxd2946xxx  in the bound closed state and in the bound open
state could suggest that channel gating did not strongly
influence the access of the molecule to its site. these slow
association rate constants for  xxxd2946xxx  can be related to the
location of the binding site if one supposes, as discussed
above, that it is located deeper within the channel pore. this
is the case for the 2⬘ pore-lining position. if so, the picrotinbinding site is likely to reside at the end of an effective tunnel
of structures (the channel pore), with steric hindrance to the
drug on its path to the binding site; this will, in turn, slow
down the diffusion of  xxxd2946xxx  to its target (43). this hypothesis does not, however, explain the fast dissociation rate constant of  xxxd2946xxx  for the open state, unless one supposes that
the putative site where  xxxd2946xxx  binds deep within the channel renders this molecule more sensitive to thermal agitation
(43) because of ionic flux when the channel open. this
hypothesis also implies that  xxxd2946xxx  must have access to its
binding site even when the channel is in a conformation that
does not allow ionic flux. our experimental data provide
evidence that picrotoxinin and  xxxd2946xxx  cannot directly bind
to the unliganded closed conformation of the receptor,
although they can bind to the ligand-bound closed conformations. accordingly, glycine binding must evoke intermediate conformational changes of the channel prior to opening, as suggested previously (44). finally, because the
homomeric ␣2 glyr channel opens from the fully liganded
closed state only (20, 44), which was not the case for homovolume 282 • number 22 • june 1, 2007

binding site was supposed to be closer to the 6⬘ pore-lining
residue, at least in homomeric ␣1  xxxg863xxx  (38). the 2⬘-position is
located deeper within the channel pore than the 6⬘-position (8),
and this could explain the voltage-dependent inhibitory effect
of  xxxd2946xxx  when compared with the effect of picrotoxinin, if we
hypothesize that the  xxxd2946xxx -binding site is close to the 2⬘
pore-lining position.
 xxxd2946xxx  and picrotoxinin are equally effective in inhibiting
homomeric ␣1  xxxg863xxx  (17), which was not the case for homomeric ␣2  xxxg863xxx . this is surprising because ␣2 glyr subunits are
almost identical to ␣1 glyr subunits throughout m2 and the
m2–m3 loop, except for the alanine 2⬘-glycine substitution.
interestingly, gabaars and gabacrs, being insensitive to
 xxxd2946xxx , also contain an alanine at the 2⬘-position. hydroxyl
groups of threonine 6⬘ residues are likely to contribute important h-bonds to ptx oxygens (13), and it should also be
pointed out that the amphipathic nature of glycine residue at
the 2⬘-position in ␣1 glyr subunits could allow both hydrophobic interactions between  xxxd1850xxx  backbone methylene atoms and
the isoprenyl group of picrotoxinin, and hydrophilic interactions between polar backbone atoms and the hydroxyl of  xxxd2946xxx  (39). this proposal would explain the lack of discrimination
of ␣1 between the two components of ptx. in contrast, the
presence of alanine at the 2⬘-position would explain the lower
apparent affinity of  xxxd2946xxx  in inhibiting ␣2  xxxg863xxx  compared
with that of picrotoxinin. this hypothesis is further supported
by the fact that both gabaa and gabac receptors contain an
alanine at the 2⬘ pore-lining position (36). because the glyr ␣3
subunit also contains alanine at the 2⬘ pore-lining position, one
might also expect different ic50 values for  xxxd2946xxx  and picrotoxinin on ␣3 glyr, which remains to be demonstrated (but see
ref. 40).
the difference in  xxxd2946xxx  sensitivity between ␣2  xxxg863xxx  and
␣1  xxxg863xxx  might also result from different conformational
changes of the channel pore between these two glyr subtypes.
indeed, homomeric ␣1  xxxg863xxx  had a shorter open time and a
lower main conductance level than homomeric ␣2  xxxg863xxx  (41),
which indicates that the channel conformation is unlikely to be
identical between the two glyr subtypes when they are in their
open states. in that respect it could be interesting to determine
whether  xxxd2946xxx - and picrotoxinin-evoked glycine current
inhibitions have similar voltage sensitivity on homomeric ␣1
 xxxg863xxx .
how many binding sites for picrotoxinin and  xxxd2946xxx ?—
models 1 and 2 and models 4 and 5 fit equally well our experimental data with picrotoxinin and  xxxd2946xxx , respectively. from
a statistical point of view it was reasonable to choose the simplest models to describe the inhibitory effects of picrotoxinin
and  xxxd2946xxx . as mentioned previously for ptx-evoked glyr
inhibition, it was necessary to model  xxxd2946xxx  and picrotoxinin
binding to both ligand-bound closed states and to a ligandbound open state to provide a reasonably good fit of our experimental data. although unexpected if one assumes that picrotoxinin and  xxxd2946xxx  bind within the channel, this result is
consistent with what is known about the inhibition of gabaa
and gabac receptors by picrotoxinin. picrotoxinin binds to
these receptors with a higher affinity for the agonist-bound
closed state than for the agonist-bound open state (16, 42). the

 xxxg1904xxx  and ptn inhibition of ␣2 homomeric glyr
meric ␣1 glyr, this also raises the question of how many
glycine molecules are necessary to evoke such intermediate
conformational changes. as mentioned previously for ptx
(9), our kinetic simulations cannot resolve this issue because
models 2 and 3 and models 4 and 5 equally predicted picrotoxinin and  xxxd2946xxx  blocking actions, respectively.
in conclusion, the crucial insight of our study is that, contrary
to what is known about the homomeric ␣1 glyr, picrotoxinin
and  xxxd2946xxx  are not equivalent in blocking ␣2 homomeric glyr.
 xxxd2946xxx  and picrotoxinin are likely to inhibit glyr activation
via different allosteric mechanisms. although both picrotoxinin and  xxxd2946xxx  act as channel blockers and can be trapped on
their binding sites when glycine dissociates, their blocking
mechanisms have different voltage sensitivities. this difference
raises the question of the functional location of their binding
sites, at least for  xxxg863xxx .
