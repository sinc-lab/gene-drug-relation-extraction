introduction
the main strategy for treatment of schizophrenia is based
on antagonizing dopamine d2 receptors. in addition, most
second-generation antipsychotics are antagonists of serotonin 5-ht2a receptors and a1-adrenoceptors, and individual
compounds have a variety of effects on other monoamine

head twitches in rats, suggestive of 5-ht2a antagonism.
furthermore, in vivo d2 partial agonist activity of  xxxd365xxx 
was confirmed by its inhibitory effect on reserpine-induced dopa
accumulation in rats. in rat microdialysis studies,  xxxd365xxx 
slightly reduced extracellular dopamine in nucleus accumbens
but not in prefrontal cortex, whereas moderate increases of the
dopamine metabolites, homovanillic acid and dopac (3,4dihydroxy-phenyl-acetic acid), in these areas also suggested in
vivo d2 partial agonist activity. in particular, based on a lower
intrinsic activity at d2 receptors and higher binding affinities for
5-ht1a/2a receptors than aripiprazole,  xxxd365xxx  would have
a favorable antipsychotic potential without  xxxg656xxx  agonistand antagonist-related adverse effects. in conclusion,  xxxd365xxx 
is a serotonin-dopamine activity modulator with a unique pharmacology, which may offer novel treatment options across a broad
spectrum of central nervous system disorders.

receptors, such as 5-ht1a receptors. these broad target
effects have the objective of either improving antipsychotic
efficacy (with additional effects on affective symptoms or
cognitive deficits) or mitigating adverse effects [e.g., extrapyramidal symptoms (eps)] (arnt and skarsfeldt, 1998;
meltzer, 1999; roth et al., 2004; arnt et al., 2008; wong
et al., 2008; newman-tancredi, 2010; newman-tancredi and
kleven, 2011).
however, because of tolerability issues, treatment with d2
receptor antagonists is not considered to be the optimal
strategy to modulate dopaminergic activity, and the discovery
and development of  xxxg656xxx  partial agonists has provided
a well tolerated treatment with stabilizing effects on dopamine
function (stahl, 2001; citrome, 2013). so far, only one d2
partial agonist, aripiprazole, with moderate d2 intrinsic activity, has reached the market (burris et al., 2002; potkin et al.,
2003), whereas other compounds with higher d2 intrinsic
activity are in development (citrome, 2013) or have been discontinued during development, often because of lack of sufficient
clinical efficacy, e.g.,  xxxd336xxx  (newman-tancredi et al., 2007;
casey et al., 2008).
a key issue for the d2 partial agonists is to ascertain how
much intrinsic activity (or relative efficacy) is ideal in leading
589

590

maeda et al.

to optimal stabilization of dopaminergic transmission. if the d2
intrinsic activity is too high, this can lead to lack of robust
antipsychotic activity as well as pronounced adverse effects
related to increased  xxxg656xxx  tonus, e.g., nausea, vomiting,
and motor side effects, such as hyperkinesias and restlessness
(fleischhacker, 2005; newman-tancredi et al., 2007; casey
et al., 2008; stip and tourjman, 2010), whereas d2 antagonist
activity leads to an increased risk of eps and increased
prolactin secretion (casey, 1996). although aripiprazole has
offered a new approach to stabilizing the dopaminergic system,
an improvement could potentially be made by developing
a novel compound that maintains significant partial agonist
activity at d2 receptors, but with lower intrinsic activity.
in addition to the issue of optimal d2 intrinsic activity,
optimization of the pharmacological profile by a combination of additional target effects is a well known strategy to
improve the clinical efficacy and tolerability of antipsychotics.
at the clinically equivalent dose range leading to 80–90% d2
receptor occupancy, aripiprazole modulates a limited number
of additional target receptors, the primary effect being partial
agonist activity at 5-ht1a receptors with lower potency than
at d2 receptors (mamo et al., 2007; dahan et al., 2009). in
addition, human  xxxg1113xxx  occupancy is significantly
lower at clinically relevant dosages (mamo et al., 2007).
accordingly, an optimized target profile may lead to improvements in both clinical efficacy and adverse effect profile in the
treatment of schizophrenia. furthermore, a broader pharmacological profile (e.g., on selected 5-ht receptors and
a-adrenoceptor subtypes) could potentially provide opportunities for the treatment of a variety of other central nervous
system (cns) disorders and symptoms, such as depression
and anxiety, as well as stress and impulse control disorders
(drouin et al., 2002; roth et al., 2004; arnt et al., 2008; wong
et al., 2008; sallinen et al., 2013).
the present paper describes the basic pharmacological
in vitro and in vivo characterization of a novel serotonindopamine activity modulator,  xxxd365xxx  ( xxxd365xxx ; 7{4-[4-(1-benzothiophen-4-yl) xxxd2960xxx -1-yl]butoxy}quinolin-2

2 days. the cells were washed with imdm supplemented with 0.1 mm
sodium hypoxanthine and 16 mm thymidine. cells were preincubated
with test compounds for 20 minutes at 37°c in imdm medium
supplemented with 0.1% sodium ascorbate, 0.1 mm sodium hypoxanthine, and 16 mm thymidine. then, 10 mm  xxxd1742xxx  and 500 mm  xxxd2388xxx 
( xxxd2388xxx ; inhibitor of adenosine 39,59-cyclic monophosphate phosphodiesterase) were added and incubation in the
presence of test compounds was continued for an additional 10 minutes
at 37°c. the final concentration of dmso was 0.7%. the intracellular
camp concentration in each well was determined using the camp
biotrak enzyme immunoassay system (ge healthcare bioscience,
buckinghamshire, uk) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
 xxxg657xxx . a flashplate adenylyl cyclase activation assay
system (perkinelmer) was used to determine the intracellular camp
concentration in each well. hd3 receptor expressing cells (4105 cells/
well) were incubated with test compounds in a flashplate well
containing 0.1 mm  xxxd1742xxx  for 1 hour at 25°c. subsequent steps of
the assay procedure were conducted according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. final concentration of dmso was 1%.

h5-ht1a receptor gtpgs binding assay
the agonistic activities of test compounds were evaluated using
[35s]gtpgs binding to h5-ht1a receptor–expressing cell membranes.
the membrane preparation was incubated in 25 mm tris-hcl
(ph 7.4) buffer containing 50 mm nacl, 5 mm mgcl2, 0.1 mm egta,
0.55 mm gdp, and 0.03 nm [35s]gtpgs with test compounds for
1 hour at room temperature. after the reaction was terminated by
cooling on ice, the membrane was filtered through a whatman gf/b
filter (sigma-aldrich) and the radioactivity was counted using a tricarb 2900tr liquid scintillation analyzer (perkinelmer). final
concentration of dmso was 1%.

h5ht2a receptor inositol monophosphate–homogeneous
time-resolved fluorescence functional assay
cells were suspended in buffer containing 10 mm hepes/naoh
(ph 7.4), 4.2 mm kcl, 146 mm nacl, 1 mm cacl2, 0.5 mm mgcl2,
5.5 mm glucose, and 50 mm licl and then distributed in microplates at
a density of 1.5  104 cells/well. for agonist functional assays, the cells
were incubated for 30 minutes at 37°c in the presence of buffer (basal
control), test compound, or reference agonist. for stimulated control
measurement, separate assay wells contained 10 mm serotonin. for
antagonist functional assays, the cells were preincubated for 5 minutes
at room temperature in the presence of buffer (basal control), test
compound, or reference antagonist. thereafter, the reference agonist
serotonin was added at a final concentration of 100 nm. for basal
control measurements, separate assay wells without serotonin were
used. cells were further incubated for 30 minutes.
after incubation, the cells were lysed and the fluorescence acceptor
(d2-labeled inositol monophosphate [ip1]) and fluorescence donor (antiip1 antibody labeled with europium cryptate) were added. after 60
minutes at room temperature, the fluorescence transfer was measured
at lex 5 337 nm and lem 5 620 and 665 nm using a microplate reader
(rubystar; bmg labtech, cary, nc). the ip1 concentration was
determined by dividing the signal measured at 665 nm by that
measured at 620 nm (ratio). the results were expressed as a percent of
the control response to 10 mm serotonin. these studies were performed
at cerep s.a.

h5-ht2b receptor ip1-homogeneous time-resolved

mgcl2, 5.5 mm glucose, and 50 mm licl and then distributed in
microplates at a density of 4  104 cells/well and incubated for 30
minutes at 37°c in the presence of buffer (basal control), test compound,
or reference agonist. for agonist functional assays, separate assay wells
containing 1 mm serotonin were used as stimulated control. for
antagonist functional assays, the reference agonist serotonin was added
at a final concentration of 30 nm. separate assay wells without
serotonin were used as basal control. after incubation, the cells were
lysed and the fluorescence acceptor (d2-labeled ip1) and fluorescence
donor (anti-ip

fifteen minutes after the injection, the animals were killed by a blow
to the head and decapitated, and the striatum (d2 and  xxxg1119xxx  binding)
or cortex (5-ht2a binding) was dissected. the tissue was homogenized
in ice-cold buffer [50 mm kpo4, ph 7.4 (for d2); 50 mm tris, ph 7.7
(for 5-ht2a and  xxxg1119xxx )], samples were filtered through whatman gf/c
filters, and the filters were washed with 2  5 ml ice-cold buffer.
filtration was completed 60–120 seconds after death. filters were
counted in a scintillation counter. trunk blood together with remaining
brain tissue was collected during the experiment from each animal for
compound exposure analysis. protein content was measured in all brain
samples according to pierces method by bicinchoninic acid–enzymelinked immunosorbant and was subsequently used for normalization.
cerebellum was dissected from vehicle-treated animals and used to
determine nonspecific binding.

were moderate and very low, respectively.
a number of other receptor and target affinities have been
investigated. results are listed in supplemental table 2,
because they are currently not considered to be important for
understanding the pharmacological profile of  xxxd365xxx 
because of low affinities. although  xxxd365xxx  had moderate inhibitory effects on monoamine uptake in rat brain
synaptosomes (supplemental table 4), the affinities for
human dopamine, noradrenaline, and serotonin transporters
were weaker than those for the above mentioned receptors
(supplemental table 2).

 xxxd365xxx  is a h5-ht1a, hd2l, and hd3 receptor partial
agonist in vitro
h5-ht1a receptors. partial agonist activities of  xxxd365xxx  and reference compounds were evaluated using
[35s]gtpgs binding to h5-ht1a receptor–expressing cell membranes.  xxxd365xxx , aripiprazole, buspirone, and  xxxd336xxx 
increased [35s]gtpgs binding in a concentration-dependent
manner (fig. 2; table 4). the maximum effect (emax) values of
the three first compounds were relatively similar (60, 73, and
78%, respectively, expressed relative to the maximum effect
of 10 mm serotonin), whereas  xxxd336xxx  had a significantly
higher emax value (90%; p , 0.05) than  xxxd365xxx  and
aripiprazole. the agonist effect of  xxxd365xxx  (100 nm) was
blocked by the selective  xxxg1108xxx  antagonist way100635 (ic50 = 0.30 nm; data not shown).
hd2l receptors. partial agonist activities of  xxxd365xxx 
and aripiprazole were evaluated using the inhibition of forskolininduced camp accumulation in hd2l receptor-expressing cells.
dopamine almost completely inhibited camp accumulation in
a concentration-dependent manner (fig. 3a) and  xxxd336xxx  also
had high emax value in this assay. in contrast,  xxxd365xxx  and
aripiprazole only partially inhibited camp accumulation, with
potencies consistent with their receptor binding affinities
(fig. 3a; table 4). the maximum inhibitory effect (emax) of
 xxxd365xxx  (43%) was significantly (p , 0.05) lower than
that of aripiprazole (61%), expressed relative to the maximum
inhibition induced by dopamine (table 4).
hd3 receptors. partial agonist activities of  xxxd365xxx 
and aripiprazole were evaluated using inhibition of forskolininduced increase of camp accumulation in hd3 receptor–
expressing cells.  xxxd365xxx  and aripiprazole partially
inhibited camp accumulation in a concentration-dependent
manner (fig. 3b; table 4). in comparison with the maximum
inhibition measured with 10 mm dopamine,  xxxd365xxx  had
a significantly lower emax value than aripiprazole in this
assay (15 and 28%, respectively, p , 0.05). the agonist effect
of  xxxd365xxx  (500 nm) was blocked by coincubation with

as well as the effect of adrenaline on camp production at ha1band ha2c-adrenoceptors. highest antagonist potency was
observed at ha1b-adrenoceptors (cic50 = 0.66 nm), whereas
slightly lower potencies were found at h5-ht2a/2b receptors
and ha2c-adrenoceptors (table 4).
 xxxd365xxx  had no agonist activity in the absence of
agonist stimulation in these assays after incubation with concentrations of up to 1 mm (h5-ht2a; ha1b) or 10 mm (h5-ht2b;
ha2c), respectively (data not shown).

aripiprazole had lower potency with an ed50 of about 30 mg/kg

p.o. (table 5). finally, the ex vivo binding to r5-ht7 receptors in
paraventricular nucleus of thalamus was insignificant for both
 xxxd365xxx  and aripiprazole over the dose range used in this
study, showing a maximum of about 40% receptor occupancy at

an overview of the plasma exposure-receptor occupancy
relationship of  xxxd365xxx  for the in vivo and ex vivo binding
studies in rats illustrates the rank order of binding potencies at
the different receptors, as described above (fig. 5).
 xxxd365xxx  is a d2 partial agonist in vivo: inhibitory
effects on reserpine-induced dopa accumulation in rat
striatum
reserpine (1 mg/kg s.c., 18 hours before death) increased
dopa accumulation ∼4-fold in rat striatum (supplemental
fig. 1).  xxxd365xxx  and aripiprazole both showed d2
agonist effects by inhibiting the reserpine-induced increase
in dopa accumulation but had different maximum inhibitory
responses (table 6). they had similar potencies based on ed25
values, whereas the maximum inhibitory effect of  xxxd365xxx  was lower (55%) than that of aripiprazole (89%). two-way
anova indicated a significant effect of drug (main effect; p ,
0.01) and a drug  dose interaction (p , 0.05).
 xxxd365xxx  is a 5-ht2a antagonist in vivo: doi-induced
head twitches in rats
doi induces frequent head twitches, with on average 19–21
episodes for 10 minutes after injection of 5 mg/kg s.c. (data not
shown).  xxxd365xxx  and aripiprazole dose dependently
inhibited doi-induced head twitches (table 6),  xxxd365xxx 
(ed50 = 4.7 mg/kg p.o.) being more potent than aripiprazole
(ed50 = 21 mg/kg p.o.). as expected, risperidone potently
blocked doi-induced head twitches (ed50 = 0.096 mg/kg p.o.;
data not shown).

cells. data are mean 6 s.d. of three assays performed in duplicate (a) or

of  xxxd1742xxx -induced camp accumulation (set at 100%).

plasma and brain exposure in rats (fig. 4). plasma exposures
were between 44 and 146 ng/ml, 1–4 hours after administration (fig. 4a), whereas brain levels were slightly lower (12–46
ng/g; fig. 4b).
 xxxd365xxx  also potently displaced the binding of the
 xxxg1113xxx  ligand [3h]m100907 in cortex (ed50 = 4.6 mg/kg
p.o.). the binding potency at 5-ht2a receptors was 26 times
higher than that of aripiprazole (ed50 = 120 mg/kg p.o.) based
on the ed50 values (table 5).
 xxxd365xxx  had moderate potency in displacing binding
of the  xxxg1119xxx  ligand [3h]lu ae60157 in rat striatum (ed50 =
17 mg/kg p.o.), whereas the potency of aripiprazole was very
low (table 5).

a series of experiments have been performed to explore the
effects of  xxxd365xxx  on extracellular dopamine, noradrenaline, serotonin, acetylcholine, and histamine levels in rats.
dopamine and metabolites in nucleus accumbens.
 xxxd365xxx  (10 mg/kg p.o.) slightly, but significantly, reduced extracellular dopamine levels (fig. 6a). maximum
decrease was 74 6 6.5% of baseline levels, in comparison with
the vehicle group (87 6 5.8% of baseline), and was observed
120–150 minutes after drug administration. the higher dose
(20 mg/kg) induced a nonsignificant decrease. in contrast,
 xxxd365xxx  slightly increased the extracellular levels of the
dopamine metabolites hva and dopac (fig. 6, b and c,
respectively). maximum increases of hva and dopac were
30 and 20% above baseline levels, respectively, after 10 and
20 mg/kg, occurring 150–180 minutes (hva) and 60–180
minutes (dopac) after drug administration. in the vehicle
group, slight decreases (4 and 8%, respectively) were seen,
compared with baseline levels.
dopamine and metabolites in prefrontal cortex.
 xxxd365xxx  had no effect on extracellular dopamine levels
after administration of 1, 3, and 10 mg/kg p.o. (fig. 7a), whereas
dopamine metabolite levels significantly increased at the 3
and 10 mg/kg doses. maximum increases in comparison with
baseline levels at the two doses were 41 and 96% for hva
(fig. 7b) and 44 and 110% for dopac (fig. 7c), whereas
levels in the vehicle group increased nonsignificantly by 12
and 6%, respectively, for hva and dopac. maximum effects
occurred 150–180 minutes after drug administration.

extracellular levels of serotonin or noradrenaline in either
brain region after administration of doses up to 30 mg/kg p.o.
(supplemental fig. 3, a and b).
histamine and acetylcholine in prefrontal cortex.
 xxxd365xxx  increased extracellular histamine levels after
administration of 10, and in particular, 30 mg/kg p.o. (fig. 8),
whereas no changes in extracellular acetylcholine were observed at any dose (supplemental fig. 3c). histamine levels
also increased after vehicle administration but the effect was
short lasting, whereas the increase after  xxxd365xxx  (30 mg/kg)
was stable for at least 3 hours.

 xxxd365xxx  had a balanced and unique activity on several monoaminergic receptors. its major effects at clinically
relevant concentrations consisted of partial agonist activity
on h5-ht1a receptors and hd2l and hd3 receptors combined
with antagonist activity on h5-ht2a receptors and ha1b- and
ha2c-adrenoceptors.
serotonin-dopamine-noradrenergic binding in vitro
and in vivo.  xxxd365xxx  displayed almost equal subnanomolar
affinities for several cloned human receptors, including
h5-ht1a, hd2l, and 5-hht2a receptors, as well as ha1b- and
ha2c-adrenoceptors. the affinity constants (ki) were in the
range 0.12–0.59 nm. consequently, the occupancies of these
receptors after  xxxd365xxx  treatment will likely be
similar in vivo. although both  xxxd365xxx  and aripiprazole
showed high affinities for h- xxxg1108xxx  and hd2 receptors,
 xxxd365xxx  had a slightly higher affinity for h5-ht1a
receptors than hd2 receptors, whereas the reverse was true
for aripiprazole (table 2). furthermore,  xxxd365xxx 
bound with about ten times higher affinity to h5-ht1a and
h5-ht2a receptors and much higher affinity to ha1b- and
ha2c-adrenoceptors than aripiprazole (table 2). the only
available method to measure human receptor occupancy is

shows average plasma exposure (nanogram per milliliter) at a given dose,
and ordinate shows corresponding receptor occupancy of the indicated

analyses.

positron emission tomography imaging, and d2 antagonist
antipsychotics are usually dosed to obtain 60–80% occupancy (e.g., mamo et al., 2007). at the recommended doses of
aripiprazole human d2/ xxxg657xxx  occupancies are higher,
up to 90% (yokoi et al., 2002; kegeles et al., 2008).
consistent with its low h5-ht2a affinity, it has been shown
that h5-ht2a receptor occupancy of aripiprazole is lower
(54–60%; mamo et al., 2007) compared with second generation antipsychotics, e.g., olanzapine, which almost saturates 5-ht2a receptors (kapur et al., 1998). no positron
emission tomography ligands for measuring a-adrenoceptor
subtype occupancies are presently available, so only relative
in vitro affinities can predict human occupancies.
to support translation from animal pharmacology to human
efficacy, we included rat receptor affinity data for selected
receptors (d2, 5-ht1a, 5-ht2, and a1-adrenergic receptors).
although there was consistency in the affinity (ki values)
between humans and rats for d2 and 5-ht1a receptors,
r5-ht2 receptor affinity was slightly lower than that for
h5-ht2a receptors. a similar comparison could not be made
for ra1-adrenoceptors because of assay limitations and lack of
selective ligands.
to further improve the predictive validity of animal data for
human pharmacology, in vivo and ex vivo binding potencies to

rat cns receptors have been included for  xxxd365xxx 
and aripiprazole. these results confirmed the equipotency of
 xxxd365xxx  at 5-ht1a, d2/3, and 5-ht2a receptors, whereas
the relative potencies of aripiprazole were largely different. in
contrast, the low in vivo and ex vivo binding potencies of both
compounds at  xxxg1119xxx  and 5-ht7 receptors suggest that these
targets do not contribute to their pharmacological profiles in
rats, although the h5-ht7 receptor affinity was rather high for
 xxxd365xxx  (ki 3.7 nm; supplemental table 1) and may
contribute to the pharmacological profile in humans.
in vitro and in vivo modulation of serotonin-dopamine
activity. receptor binding affinity profiling is insufficient to
characterize the functional effects of  xxxd365xxx , which displays partial agonist and antagonist activities at different receptor subtypes. accordingly, functional characterization was
performed at several human receptors in vitro and at rat d2
and 5-ht2a receptors in vivo.  xxxd365xxx  showed partial
agonist activity at hd2 and hd3 receptors in cloned cell assays,
with lower intrinsic activity than aripiprazole. in accordance
with this,  xxxd365xxx  had lower maximum agonist effect
than aripiprazole in an in vivo model of d2 autoreceptor activity, inhibition of reserpine-induced l-dopa accumulation
(supplemental figs. 1 and 2), confirming a lower intrinsic
activity at the  xxxg656xxx  in vivo. d2 autoreceptors develop
increased agonist sensitivity after monoamine depletion after
reserpine treatment (hjorth et al., 1988), and consequently
aripiprazole, but not  xxxd365xxx , had marked efficacy. in contrast, d2 partial agonists, including aripiprazole and  xxxd365xxx , have functional d2 antagonist activity in most tests of
postsynaptic  xxxg656xxx –mediated effects, as described earlier
(arnt and hyttel, 1990) and in the accompanying paper (maeda
et al., 2014).
in vitro functional studies at h5-ht1a receptors suggest
similar efficacies for  xxxd365xxx , aripiprazole, and buspirone,
although in vivo functional data in rats are not yet available.
 xxxd365xxx  and aripiprazole showed antagonist activity
in vitro at other serotonin receptor subtypes. for 5-ht2a receptors, the in vitro profiling of  xxxd365xxx  is supported by in
vivo results showing potent inhibition of doi-induced head
twitches in rats that is consistent with its in vivo binding potency. antagonism of 5-ht2a receptors is the primary mechanism involved in head twitching, but 5-ht1a agonists are also
inhibitory (arnt and hyttel, 1989; schreiber et al., 1995). therefore, the precise mechanism involved in the effect of  xxxd365xxx 
is uncertain and needs further exploration.  xxxd365xxx  is
a potent antagonist with no agonist activity at 5-ht2b receptors, which is important for avoiding an increased risk of
serious cardiac valvulopathy (elangbam, 2010). effects of

were weaker and are unlikely to be of importance at clinically
relevant doses (supplemental table 3).

601

in acute microdialysis studies the functional effects of
 xxxd365xxx  on extracellular neurotransmitter levels in vivo
have been explored in nucleus accumbens, prefrontal cortex,
and ventral hippocampus. the results showed limited changes
at the doses studied, suggesting that in an uncompromised
system  xxxd365xxx  has neutral effects as measured by
microdialysis techniques. a small decrease in dopamine levels
in nucleus accumbens paralleled with slight increases in the
metabolites hva and dopac may indicate d2 partial agonism,
as previously reported in the striatum (jordan et al., 2004). in
the prefrontal cortex the regulation of neurotransmitter levels
is different from nucleus accumbens; whereas selective d2
antagonists alone have no effect, d2 antagonism in conjunction with, e.g., 5-ht2a antagonism or 5-ht1a partial agonism,
may increase extracellular dopamine and acetylcholine (mørk
et al., 2009; meltzer, 1999, 2012). accordingly,  xxxd365xxx 
would be expected to increase dopamine and acetylcholine in
the prefrontal cortex as well, which did not happen despite
slight increases in levels of hva and dopac. similar results
were seen with aripiprazole and they are likely due to d2
partial agonism (jordan et al., 2004; li et al., 2004). finally,
high doses of  xxxd365xxx  increased extracellular levels of
histamine in the prefrontal cortex. this may be a consequence
of its moderate affinity and antagonist activity on  xxxg2028xxx  receptors as shown in vitro (table 2 and supplemental table 3,
respectively; fell et al., 2012). accordingly, the risk for weight
gain and metabolic adverse effects after  xxxd365xxx  treatment is limited (nasrallah, 2008).
relevance of target profile for clinical efficacy and
side effect potential. as mentioned,  xxxd365xxx  displayed significantly lower intrinsic activity at hd2 and rd2
receptors compared with aripiprazole. this may improve the
tolerability of  xxxd365xxx  with respect to d2 agonist–
mediated adverse effects, e.g., nausea, insomnia, and akathisia
(fleischhacker, 2005). also, the potential for d2 antagonist–like
adverse effects (e.g., eps and hyperprolactinemia) may be
lower than experienced with d2 antagonist antipsychotics
(casey, 1996; maeda et al., 2014; supplemental figs. 1–3;
supplemental tables 1–4). the optimum balance between d2
agonism and antagonism is not known, but the weak effects of
 xxxd365xxx  on extracellular monoamine levels in normal
rats suggest that its low intrinsic activity stabilizes dopaminergic function. however, it remains to be documented
whether these differences can be extended to the clinical
profiles of the compounds.
the fact that the antagonist activity at 5-ht2a and activity
at d2 receptors occurred at similar doses of  xxxd365xxx ,
whereas aripiprazole had a lower  xxxg1113xxx  occupancy
at any given  xxxg656xxx  occupancy, may lead to clinical
advantages, because 5-ht2a antagonism is thought to contribute to antipsychotic activity, reduced akathisia potential, improvement of cognitive performance and sleep patterns, as well
as effects on affective states (monti, 2010; snigdha et al., 2010;
ebdrup et al., 2011; laoutidis and luckhaus, 2013).
the effects of  xxxd365xxx  and aripiprazole on h5-ht1a
and hd3 receptors are important for their pharmacological
profiles. partial agonism at 5-ht1a and d3 receptors is
involved in the antipsychotic and procognitive profiles as well
as effects on affective states (newman-tancredi and kleven,
2011; gross and drescher, 2012). the combined 5-ht1a and
5-ht2a effects are of particular importance for the procognitive effect of  xxxd365xxx  (maeda et al., 2014).

arrow. the ordinate shows extracellular levels of histamine, expressed in
percentage of baseline levels. mean 6 s.e.m. of results from 8 rats. *p ,
0.05 significant difference from vehicle group.

the consequences of the high affinities of  xxxd365xxx  for
(and antagonist effects on) a1b- and a2c-adrenoceptors are
more difficult to predict because of a lack of selective compounds for studying the functional importance of these
receptors. results using genetically modified mice suggest
that a1b-antagonism may contribute to antipsychotic-like
activity and effects on stimulant-induced reward (drouin
et al., 2002). inhibition of peripheral a1a-adrenoceptors (for
which  xxxd365xxx  and aripiprazole have moderate affinities) are thought to be important for regulation of blood
pressure but may not contribute to the overall effects of
 xxxd365xxx  (docherty, 2010). all a1-adrenoceptor subtypes
are coexpressed with 5-ht2a receptors in frontal cortex, but
their relative functional importance is unknown (santana
et al., 2013). similarly, the a2c-adrenoceptor field is immature, but antagonism has been proposed to contribute to
antidepressant-like and procognitive activity (quaglia et al.,
2011; sallinen et al., 2013). clearly, more studies are necessary
to explore the role of a-adrenoceptor antagonism for the profile
of  xxxd365xxx .
in conclusion,  xxxd365xxx  is a serotonin-dopamine activity
modulator with potential for treatment of several cns disorders.  xxxd365xxx  is in advanced clinical development.
