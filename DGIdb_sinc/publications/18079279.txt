abstract
dehydroepiandrosterone (dhea), a c19 human adrenal steroid,
activates peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor ␣ (ppar␣)
in vivo but does not ligand-activate ppar␣ in transient transfection experiments. we demonstrate that dhea regulates
ppar␣ action by altering both the levels and phosphorylation
status of the receptor. human hepatoma cells (hepg2) were
transiently transfected with the expression plasmid encoding
ppar␣ and a plasmid containing two copies of fatty acyl coenzyme oxidase (faco) peroxisome-proliferator activated receptor responsive element consensus oligonucleotide in a luciferase reporter gene. nafenopin treatment increased reporter
gene activity in this system, whereas dhea treatment did not.
okadaic acid significantly decreased nafenopin-induced reporter activity in a concentration-dependent manner. okadaic
acid treatment of primary rat hepatocytes decreased both
dhea- and nafenopin-induced faco activity in primary rat

peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor ␣ (ppar␣,
 xxxg1805xxx ) is a member of the nuclear receptor superfamily and
functions as a ligand-activated transcription factor (isseman
et al., 1990; sher et al., 1993). ppar␣ is expressed in significant levels in human liver, heart, kidney, skeletal muscle,
intestine, and pancreas, and it is also detectable in lung,
placenta, and adipose tissue (auboeuf et al., 1997; mukherjee
et al., 1997). hepatic ppar␣ mrna levels have been rethis work was supported in part by a predoctoral fellowship from the ohio

hepatocytes. dhea induced both ppar␣ mrna and protein
levels, as well as pp2a message in primary rat hepatocytes.
western blot analysis showed that the serines at positions 12
and 21 were rapidly dephosphorylated upon treatment with
dhea and nafenopin. results using specific protein phosphatase inhibitors suggested that protein phosphatase 2a (pp2a)
is responsible for dhea action, and protein phosphatase 1
might be involved in nafenopin induction. mutation of serines at
position 6, 12, and 21 to an uncharged alanine residue significantly increased transcriptional activity, whereas mutation to
negative charged aspartate residues (mimicking receptor phosphorylation) decreased transcriptional activity. dhea action involves induction of ppar␣ mrna and protein levels as well as
increased ppar␣ transcriptional activity through decreasing
receptor phosphorylation at serines in the af1 region.

ported to be lower in humans than in rodents (palmer et al.,
1998). in vivo, ppar␣ can be activated with peroxisome
proliferators (pp), such as fibrate drugs (e.g., wy-14643,  xxxd1724xxx ), nonfibrate drugs (nafenopin),  xxxd2154xxx , chlorinated compounds, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs,
and endogenous steroids, such as dehydroepiandrosterone
(dhea) (escher and whali, 2000). most pp serve as ligands
for the receptor, and their binding results in ligand-dependent activation of a distinct set of genes involved in lipid
metabolism and homeostasis, peroxisome proliferation and
cell growth (rao et al., 1992; tirona and kim, 2004). however, ligand-independent processes can also activate these
receptors, such as elevated levels of retinoid x receptor ␣.
shipley and waxman (2003) have concluded that pp act
through mechanisms leading to either direct ligand-activation

dhea induces ppar␣ expression and phosphorylation

materials and methods
chemicals. dhea was purchased from steraloids (newport, ri),
and nafenopin was a gift from novartis (ardsley, ny). wy-14643,
okadaic acid, and the other biochemicals used were purchased from
the sigma chemical co. (st. louis, mo). tautomycin was purchased
from calbiochem (la jolla, ca). antibodies against rat ppar␣,
ppar␣ (phospho s12) antibody, and ppar␣ (phospho s21) antibody
were purchased from abcam, inc. (cambridge, ma).
plasmids. the luciferase reporter plasmid gstmin was constructed by isolating 164 base pairs of the minimal promoter from
the 5⬘-flanking region of the rat glutathione transferase a2 gene
(falkner et al., 2001) and inserting it into the hindiii/kpni sites of
 xxxg2041xxx -basic (invitrogen, carlsbad, ca). the expression plasmids for
the murine ppar␣ (boie et al., 1993) were provided by thomas
rushmore (merck research laboratory, west point, pa). the luciferase reporter plasmid ppreluc contained two copies of the peroxisome proliferator responsive element from rat faco peroxisome
proliferator-activated receptor responsive element (ppre) inserted
upstream of the minimal promoter construct gstmin. the expression plasmid for ␤-galactosidase (pcmv␤) was purchased from
clontech (mountain view, ca). all plasmids were transformed
into dh5␣ escherichia coli bacteria, isolated, and prepared for
use in transient transfections using qiagen plasmid prep kits
(qiagen, valencia, ca).
treatment of rats. male sprague-dawley rats (180–200 g; hsd:
sd, harlan, indianapolis, in) were fed a diet of ain76a diet (purina,
st. louis, mo) and treated with either 80 mg/kg body weight dhea
or nafenopin daily for 4 days. the animals were anesthetized with
carbon dioxide and killed by cervical dislocation. these procedures
were approved by the university of louisville institutional animal
care and use committee. the livers were flash-frozen in liquid
nitrogen and stored at ⫺80°c until mrna was isolated using
trizol reagent according to the manufacturer’s protocol (invitrogen, carlsbad, ca).
primary hepatocyte culture. male sprague-dawley rats (180–
200 g; hsd:sd, harlan) were used for liver perfusion as described by

the method of bayliss and skett (1996). cell survival was determined
by trypan blue exclusion (berry et al., 1991), and hepatocytes having
viability greater than 80% were used and were plated at a density of
4 ⫻ 106 cells/dish onto 60-mm plastic dishes precoated with collagen
in williams e/ham’s f12 1:1 mixed medium as described by ferrini
et al. (1998) and isom and georgoff (1984). after allowing the cells to
attach for 4 h, the medium was changed and renewed every 24 h
thereafter in the absence of serum. the cells were treated with
various concentrations of the following inducers: nafenopin, dhea,
and wy-14643. okadaic acid and tautomycin dissolved in dmso
were used as phosphatase inhibitors.
peroxisomal ␤-oxidation of fatty acid activity (faco). cultured rat hepatocytes were collected to measure nadh formation using
0.01 ␮m  xxxd2832xxx -coa (sigma) as a substrate as described by lazarow
(1981). subcellular fractions (5000g supernantant) were diluted in 0.25
m sucrose, and the enzymatic reaction was carried out in a mixture
containing the following: 0.2 mm nad⫹, 1 mm dtt, 0.1 mm coa, 0.01
mm fad, and 1 mm potassium cyanide. protein concentration was
measured using the bradford assay (bradford, 1976).
quantitative real-time pcr of mrna. total rna from rat liver
or primary hepatocytes was extracted using trizol reagent following
the manufacturer protocol (invitrogen, carlsbad, ca). the genomic
dna was digested with dnase i (invitrogen), and the rna was cleaned
using an rneasy mini kit (qiagen). reverse transcription (rt) reactions were carried out in a final volume of 20 ␮l with 1 ␮g of rat total
rna, 0.45 ␮g of random hexamer, 20 u of rnasin, 0.5 ␮m dntp mix,
and 200 u of moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase at
42°c for 1 h (promega, madison, wi). the cdna product was treated to
remove rna and the oligo dna mixture with rnase h digestion and
qiaquick pcr purification kit (promega). the taqman reaction was
carried out with a dna sequence detection analyzer (abi7900; applied
biosystems, foster city, ca) in a total volume of 25 ␮l using 2.2 pmol
of reverse and forward primers. the primers used are shown in table 1.
primers for 18s rrna (5-carboxyfluorescein-labeled and joe-labeled)
were purchased from invitrogen.
immunoblot analysis. hepatocytes were harvested in m-per
reagent (sigma) supplemented with phosphatase inhibitor cocktail
i-ii (sigma) and with halt protease inhibitor kit (pierce chemical,
rockford, il) according to the manufacturer protocol. protein (20 ␮g)
was loaded to the gel and run using the method described by laemmli (1970). proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride
membranes (towbin et al., 1979) and rinsed with either anti-rat
ppar␣, anti-rat ppar␣ (phospho-ser-12), or anti-rat ppar␣ (phospho-ser-21) as a primary antibody (abcam). enhanced chemiluminescence (ecl detection system; ge healthcare, chalfont st. giles,
buckinghamshire, uk) was used to detect the target protein of
interest. the western blots were scanned with fluorescence scanning
using a storm 860 phosphorimager, and the immune complexes
were quantified with imagequant software (ge healthcare).
mutation of serines 6, 12, and 21 of murine ppar␣. sitedirected mutagenesis of ppar␣ expression vector was performed
with the gene tailor site-directed mutagenesis kit purchased from
invitrogen. oligonucleotides for mutagenesis were purchased from
integrated dna technologies (coralville, ia). the following nucleotide sequence changes were performed: for the s12a mutant, codon
12 (tccser) to (gccala); for the s21a mutant, codon 21 (agtser) to
(gctala); for the double mutant s12a-s21a, codon 21 of the s12a

of the receptor or through perturbation of lipid metabolism/
transport, leading to release of ppar␣ ligands. in addition,
several pp have been suggested to also activate mitogen-activated protein kinase (mapk) pathways, providing three distinct mechanisms of receptor activation (gardner et al., 2003).
ligand-activation of the ppar␣ receptor by dhea has
never been demonstrated in assays using immortalized cell
lines, although it is well established that dhea affects
ppar␣ target genes in vivo, such as cytochrome p450 genes
(cyp4a1, cyp2c11) and fatty acyl coenzyme oxidase
(faco) (wu et al., 1989; prough et al., 1994, peters et al.,
1996; ripp et al., 2003).
in this study, we provide evidence that in primary rat
hepatocytes, dhea, nafenopin, and wy-14643 induce protein and mrna levels of ppar␣ and, thereby, ppar␣-regulated ␻-oxidation of  xxxd2154xxx . in transiently transfected
hepg2 cells and cultured rat hepatocytes, the phosphatase
inhibitor okadaic acid also alters regulation by these inducers. in our studies, we sought to test the hypothesis that
dhea increases the levels of ppar␣ and decreases phosphorylation status of the ppar␣ receptor in hepatocytes,
leading to increased transcriptional activity. this indirect
mechanism of activation of ppar␣ via increases in protein
content and decreases in phosphorylation status of the receptor may account for the action of dhea in regulating this
important transcription factor, instead of through direct ligand activation.

results
okadaic acid alters nafenopin-dependent induction of ppreluc reporter expression in hepg2 cells.
in our experiments, the role of ppar␣ phosphorylation was
investigated by treatment with different peroxisome proliferators and using protein phosphatase inhibitors. hepg2
cells were transfected with ppar␣ expression vector in the
presence of ppreluc reporter and treated with various concentrations of okadaic acid (20–40 nm) or 50 ␮m nafenopin
plus okadaic acid for 24 h (fig. 1). unexpectedly, okadaic acid
itself significantly inhibited the activity of the ppreluc
reporter gene in the absence of cotransfection with the
ppar␣ expression plasmid. ppar␣ was able to positively
regulate the ppre responsive element, an effect that was
reversed with increasing concentration of okadaic acid. in the
presence of nafenopin, the activation of the luciferase reporter gene was over 3-fold higher than what was observed in
untreated cells. okadaic acid cotreatment caused a concentration-dependent reversal of nafenopin-induced activation
of gene expression under all conditions (fig. 1).
nafenopin, wy-14643, and dhea induce faco activity in primary rat hepatocytes. based on our previous
findings that dhea does not serve as a direct activator of
ppar␣ to induce ppre-containing genes in cultured cell
lines, but does induce faco and cyp4a1 mrna and protein
in vivo and in primary cultures of rat hepatocytes, we used
primary hepatocytes to evaluate the mechanism of ppar␣dependent induction. hepatocytes were treated with varying
concentrations of dhea and two other peroxisome proliferators for 48 h. cell supernatant fractions were obtained by
sedimentation at 5000g and faco activity was measured.
concentrations between 10 and 25 ␮m of either dhea,
nafenopin, or wy-14643 caused a 2- to 3.5-fold induction of
faco activity (fig. 2). maximal inductive effect was observed at the following concentrations: 25 ␮m nafenopin

activity was determined using  xxxd2832xxx -coa and nad⫹ as substrates.

double mutant (gctala) to (gatasp); for the s12d-s21d double
mutant, codon 21 of the s12d (gctala) to (gacasp). note that the
two individual  xxxd233xxx  mutants s12d and s21d each had
alanine at the other phosphorylation site (s12d is also s21a; s21d
is also s12a). the triple serine mutants (s6a-s12a-s21a and s6ds12d-s21d) were also prepared using this mutation cloning strategy. in each case, the constructs were sequenced in the university of
louisville’s center for genetics and molecular medicine core facility,
to assure that the appropriate nucleotide changes had been made.
hepg2 cell culture and transient transfection. hepg2
cells were cultured in dulbecco’s modified eagle’s medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and penicillin/streptomycin/
 xxxd164xxx . cells were plated in 12-well plates at a cell density of
1.5 ⫻ 105 per well. the following day, cells were transiently transfected with various plasmids using lipofectamine (invitrogen,
carlsbad, ca). after transfection, cells were treated at 24 h with
several peroxisome proliferators (dhea, nafenopin, wy-14643).
␤-galactosidase and luciferase activities were determined as described by falkner et al. (2001). data are expressed as luciferase
activity relative to ␤-galactosidase activity to correct for transfection
efficiency. all transient transfection experiments were performed in
triplicate and experiments were performed at least in duplicate.
statistical analysis. experiments were conducted in triplicate
or quadruplicate and means ⫾ s.d. were determined. statistical
comparisons among treatment groups were determined using a twotailed t test, with p ⬍ 0.05 as the criterion for significance.

dhea induces ppar␣ expression and phosphorylation

by approximately 6-fold; however, nafenopin did not seem to
increase ppar␣ message levels.
to investigate whether peroxisome proliferators induce the
levels of ppar␣ protein, primary cultures of rat hepatocytes
were treated with varying concentrations of dhea,
nafenopin, or wy14643 and receptor mrna and protein
expression was measured. at the protein level, maximal induction by dhea of 1.5-fold was observed using 10 ␮m
inducer, whereas the cells treated with 25 to 50 ␮m showed
lower ppar␣ protein levels than those given 10 ␮m (fig. 4a).
nafenopin was as potent as dhea causing a 1.5-fold increase in ppar␣ levels at 50 ␮m concentration. treatment
with 50 ␮m wy-14643 caused the most pronounced induction
of ppar␣ of 1.7-fold. the levels of ppar␣ mrna in primary
hepatocytes were also measured after treatment with dhea,
nafenopin, or wy-14643; all three displayed similar concentration-dependent induction (fig. 4b) and resulted in a 4- to
5-fold increase in mrna in the primary hepatocytes cultures.
peroxisome proliferators dephosphorylate serine
12 and 21 of ppar␣. because okadaic acid, a protein phosphatase inhibitor, decreased gene expression, we sought to
establish whether dhea may decrease levels of phosphorylation of ppar␣. primary rat hepatocytes were pretreated
with either dmso or okadaic acid in dmso for 1 h and then
treated with various peroxisome proliferators for 4 h. ppar␣
phosphorylation status was analyzed by immunoblotting using specific antibodies against monoclonal ppar␣  xxxd1857xxx  12 and  xxxd1857xxx  21. total ppar␣ levels were
quantitated with a polyclonal antibody against ppar␣. it is
noteworthy that okadaic acid treatment alone did not cause
increased phosphorylation of ser-12, suggesting that the receptor may be maximally phosphorylated under basal conditions (fig. 5a). a striking decrease in phosphorylation status
of serine-12 of around 80% was observed when the cells were
treated with dhea. this effect was partially reversed by
okadaic acid pretreatment. nafenopin also caused a 75%
reduction in phosphorylation of the receptor compared with
the receptor in untreated cells. in the presence of okadaic
acid, a slightly elevated level of phosphorylation was observed (130%). wy-14643 was less effective than dhea or
nafenopin that it only decreased phosphorylation levels by
40%. addition of okadaic acid with nafenopin or wy-14643
only increased phosphorylation to the initial level. this experiment was repeated twice with similar results.
another serine in the af-1 region proposed to be phosphorylated by action of insulin is serine 21. upon treatment with
dhea and wy-14643, the receptor becomes dephosphorylated by approximately 50% or approximately 30% with
nafenopin (fig. 5b). in addition, the levels of dephosphorylation caused by peroxisome proliferators could be prevented

(5.5-fold induction), 50 ␮m wy-14643 (4-fold induction), and
50 ␮m dhea (4-fold induction). these results demonstrate
that primary rat hepatocytes display ppar␣ activation by
dhea to the same level as other pp.
effect of okadaic acid on induction of faco activity in primary cultures of rat hepatocytes. to test
whether okadaic acid reverses the effect of peroxisome proliferators in primary hepatocytes, cells were pretreated with
various concentrations of okadaic acid for 1 h and then
treated with 50 ␮m dhea for 24 h. cell supernatant fractions were collected, and faco activity was measured from
cell supernatants. faco activity was induced approximately
5-fold in dhea-treated cells relative to control cells. pretreating cells for 1 h with various concentrations of okadaic
acid antagonized the inductive effect of dhea in a concentration-dependent manner. the suppression by 25 nm okadaic acid reached the level of activity seen in untreated cells
(fig. 3). similar results were observed with nafenopin (results not shown).
effect of dhea, nafenopin, and wy-14643 on ppar␣
mrna and protein expression in vivo and in primary
cultures of rat hepatocytes. to verify that these agents
altered the levels of ppar␣ mrna in vivo, we performed
experiments with male sprague-dawley rats to demonstrate
whether dhea or nafenopin caused changes in the levels of
hepatic ppar␣ mrna. the rats were maintained on
ain76a diet and administered i.p. either dhea or nafenopin
in corn oil at a dose of 100 mg/kg body weight daily for 4 days.
the mrna was isolated from liver and analyzed for relative
levels of ppar␣ mrna using quantitative rt-pcr. as seen
in table 2, dhea treatment caused a 5.9-fold increase in
relative ppar␣ mrna levels, whereas nafenopin caused a
30% decrease. treatment with either dhea or nafenopin
resulted in significant induction of p4504a1, demonstrating
that both compounds induced expression of this ppar␣ target gene. these results document that dhea does alter the
levels of ppar␣ message in vivo, increasing the mrna levels

mutated at positions 6, 12, and 21 in the presence of ppreluc and pcmv␤ and were subsequently treated with 50 ␮m
nafenopin or cotreated with nafenopin plus increasing concentrations of okadaic acid for 24 h.
transfecting the cells with the wild-type receptor resulted
in an 3.5-fold induction after nafenopin treatment (data not
shown). in the presence of okadaic acid, ppar-dependent
gene expression was less active than after treatment with
peroxisome proliferators alone. mutation from serine to alanine in the position of 6, 12, or 21 significantly increased the
transcriptional activity of the receptor (fig. 6). mutating all
three serine sites (6, 12, and 21) or mutating ser12 to alanine
only in the af-1 region causes a 30 to 40% increase in gene
expression. when  xxxd233xxx  mutations were introduced at
serine 21 or serines 6, 12, and 21, the cells show much less
activity (20–30% decrease) after nafenopin induction (fig. 7).

by pretreating cells with okadaic acid. in the presence of
either dhea or nafenopin, treatment with okadaic acid
caused the level of the phosphoreceptor to be slightly higher
than that seen in untreated cells (130–110%). treatment
with wy-14643 caused a lower level of phosphorylation, but
combined treatment with wy-14643 and okadaic acid did not
cause the receptor phosphorylation levels to return toward
control levels. treatment with okadaic acid alone had no
effect on the basal level of serine-21 phosphorylation. this
experiment was repeated twice with similar results. these
results demonstrate that addition of dhea to cultured rat
hepatocytes results in rapid dephosphorylation of serine 12
and serine 21 of ppar␣.
mutation of phosphorylation sites in ppar␣ receptor modulates nafenopin induction in hepg2 cells. to
test the functionality of the ppar␣ phosphorylation sites in
the af1 region, mutated ppar␣ expression vectors were
designed. serine phosphorylation sites at residues 6, 12, and

mrna induction after treatment with peroxisome

dephosphorylation of the ppar receptor, primary rat hepatocytes were treated with specific phosphatase inhibitors
such as okadaic acid (ic50 for pp1 is 20–100 nm for pp2a
0.1–1 nm), or tautomycin (ic50 for pp1 is 0.2 nm for pp2a
1–10 nm; chatfield and eastman, 2004), followed by treatment with either 10 ␮m dhea or 50 ␮m nafenopin for 48 h
(fig. 7). okadaic acid at low concentrations (2 nm) caused
significant decreases in cyp4a1 induction in cultured rat
hepatocytes; the level of inhibition was the same as that seen
at 40 nm. however, low concentrations of okadaic acid (2 nm)
had little or no effect on nafenopin induction, but higher
concentrations, such as 40 nm, almost completely prevented
the increase in cyp4a1 mrna synthesis. tautomycin (2
nm) was not as effective as okadaic acid in suppressing
induction of cyp4a1 message with dhea but was effective

discussion
phosphorylation or dephosphorylation of transcription factors often alters functional activity of that factor. phosphorylation status of a transcription factor is regulated by action
of various kinases and phosphatases, which act in a timedependent manner (hunter, 1995). phosphorylation of nuclear receptors is a major determinant of their transcriptional activity as shown for many nuclear proteins (sun et al.,
1994; reifel-miller et al., 1994; blanquart et al., 2003; tan et
al., 2005). ppar␣ is also a phosphoprotein, as was shown by
shalev et al. (1996), and its phosphorylation status could be
modified by insulin (juge-aubry et al., 1999). indeed, these
authors have shown that ppar␣ is phosphorylated in response to insulin on serine 12 and 21, by action of mapk
pathways leading to increased af-1 activity of ppar␣.

some peroxisome proliferators, like dhea, apparently act
via ppar␣ receptor, although not as a direct ligand of the
receptor. our results demonstrate that dhea treatment elevates ppar␣ levels in the cell and increases the expression
of other proteins involved in regulation of ppar␣ activation.
besides direct induction of ppar␣ expression, a second pathway of dhea action is changing the phosphorylation status
of the receptor. in our experiments, okadaic acid, a protein
phosphatase inhibitor, reduced ppre-dependent luciferase
activity in nafenopin-treated hepg2 cells, supporting an important role of phosphatases in ppar␣ action. okadaic acid
also antagonized dhea induction in primary rat hepatocytes, suggesting that the action of dhea in inducing pp2a
leads to dephosphorylation of ppar␣, and the pp2a inhibitor okadaic acid blocks dephosphorylation.
to test the hypothesis that peroxisome proliferators alter
phosphorylation status of the receptor, the levels of phosposer-12- and phospo-ser-21-ppar␣ were determined by western blot analysis with specific anti-phospho-ser-ppar␣ antibodies. both ser-12 and ser-21 are dephosphorylated after
treatment with dhea, and this effect was reversed by okadaic acid. this demonstrated that phosphorylation sites in
the af-1 region of the receptor are important in the regulation with dhea and perhaps other peroxisome proliferators
(fig. 5, a and b); phosphorylation decreased gene activation,
whereas dephosphorylation increased gene activation, as
shown in fig. 9. there seem to be three pathways for activation of ppar␣: ligand activation, induction of ppar␣ levels,
and dephosphorylation of ppar␣.
our results correlate with the work of passilly et al. (1999),
who measured acyl-coa oxidase activity as a marker gene for
ppar␣ in fao cells. in their experiments, okadaic acid and
vanadate treatment led to decreased acyl-coa oxidase activity. this negative regulation phenomenon due to phosphorylation status is also observed in ppar␥ action; e.g., preadi-

at both concentrations (2 and 120 nm being maximal) in
suppressing induction of cyp4a1 mrna by nafenopin.
these data suggest that pp2a is more involved in the dhea
induction of cyp4a1 message than pp1 (fig. 7). the opposite
was observed for nafenopin.
dhea, but not nafenopin, causes changes in pp2a
mrna levels. primary rat hepatocytes were treated with
10 ␮m dhea for 0 to 24 h, and pp2a mrna was measured.
pp2a mrna increased with time, reaching a 9-fold increase
after 8 h (fig. 8). thereafter, there was a decline in mrna
levels, possibly because of the low concentration of dhea
used in this experiment. after 8 h, there was a rapid decline
in mrna specific for pp2a, suggesting that this mrna has
a short half-life. these results suggest that dhea induces
pp2a mrna levels, accounting for the increase in dephosphorylation of serine 12 and serine 21 (figs. 5, a and b),
supporting our results with different phosphatase inhibitors
(fig. 7). nafenopin treatment (50 ␮m) did not cause significant changes in pp2a mrna.

dhea induces ppar␣ expression and phosphorylation

ulate ppar␣ on at least two levels (fig. 9); they increase
ppar␣ mrna and protein expression, and they also may
change the phosphorylation status of the receptor. both of
these mechanisms result in increases in transcriptional activity of the receptor. however, no evidence exists that dhea
functions as a ligand activator for ppar␣ in rodents, a third
mechanism of receptor regulation.

pocytes and adipocytes display similar decreases in ppar␥
action, when ppar␥ phosphorylation is stimulated by insulin acting through mapk. the phosphorylation of ppar␥
leads to a decrease in ppar␥-mediated preadipocyte differentiation into adipocytes (zhang et al., 1996; latruffe et al.,
2000). other phosphorylation pathways stimulated by  xxxg681xxx  and platelet-derived growth factor acting through mapk have a negative effect on the ppar␥
action (hu et al., 1996; adams et al., 1997; camp and tafuri,
1997). additional studies have demonstrated that this negative effect of mapk was due to the inhibition of ligand binding resulting from an alteration of the three-dimensional
structure of the receptor (shao et al., 1998). gray et al. (2005)
have also demonstrated that protein kinase c is stimulated
by the peroxisome proliferators wy-14,643. subsequent studies using mutated receptors or overexpressing forms of pkc
affected both basal and wy-14,643–induced ppar␣ activity.
serine phosphorylation in the dna binding (c-domain) and
hinge (d-domain) were shown to contribute to deceased interaction of ppar␣ and retinoid x receptor ␣ and therefore
dna binding.
mutation of ppar␣-ser 6, 12, and 21 sites to alanine, a
neutral change in charge to a residue that cannot be phosphorylated, causes an increase in the activity of the receptor
after treatment with nafenopin in hepg2 cells, but mutation
of serines in the af-1 region to negatively charged aspartic
acid residues, which may mimic the phosphorylated form of
the receptor, significantly reduces the transactivation of the
gene. it is noteworthy that okadaic acid treatment was still
able to reduce the activity after mutating serine residues to
alanine, suggesting that other phosphorylation sites may
alter activation of ppar␣-dependent gene expression. aspartate mutants (except the ser12 mutant) were not as sensitive
to a phosphatase inhibitor, which demonstrates the importance of the phosphorylation status of these serine sites after
nafenopin induction.
swales and negishi (2004) reported that transcriptional
activity of  xxxg1599xxx  is also sensitive
to okadaic acid and that this effect could be explained by the
action of a specific phosphatase (pp2a), which binds to the
receptor after activation and mediates receptor translocation
to the nucleus. to investigate the role of phosphatases in
ppar␣-dependent regulation of rat hepatocytes, changes in
cyp4a1 expression were measured after treatment with peroxisome proliferators and specific phosphatase inhibitors.
higher concentrations of okadaic acid (20 – 40 nm) are not
specific for a certain phosphatase type, but in low concentrations (2 nm), okadaic acid inhibits pp2a, but not members of
the pp1 family at this concentration (chatfield and eastman,
2004). tautomycin has an opposite effect; it displays a lower
ic50 value for pp1, relative to pp2a. induction of cyp4a1
message by nafenopin was diminished in the presence of 2
nm tautomycin, but not with 2 nm okadaic acid, suggesting a
role for pp1 in activation of gene expression by nafenopin.
induction of cyp4a1 by dhea was sensitive to low concentrations of okadaic acid, but not for 2 nm tautomycin. this
suggests that dhea induction of cyp4a1 requires pp2a for
the receptor dephosphorylation mechanism. monitoring
pp2a mrna level after dhea treatment provides further
evidence that the sterol induces ppa2 to cause dephosphorylation of the receptor.
in conclusion, peroxisome proliferators such as dhea reg-
