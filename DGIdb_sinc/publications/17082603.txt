evere combined immunodeficiencies represent a wide
spectrum of illnesses, which differ in either the qualitative
or quantitative alterations of t, b, and nk cell (1). most
forms of scid are associated with molecular alterations of genes
selectively expressed in hemopoietic cells and implicated in the
cell differentiation/activation process. thus, classical symptoms
are generally considered those related to the immunological impairment that results in increased susceptibility to infections. because patients usually die by the first year of age without an effective treatment, the clinical phenotype is predominated by the
life-threatening problems.
x-linked scid (x-scid)3 is the most common form of the
disease accounting for approximately half of all cases (2, 3). the
gene responsible for x-scid is  xxxg1176xxx  that encodes for the common cytokine receptor ␥-chain (␥c), a member of the cytokine
receptor class 1 superfamily. the molecule represents a shared

component of several receptors critical for the development and
function of lymphocytes (3). to our knowledge, an extrahemopoietic role of ␥c has not yet been demonstrated, although the abundance of the protein in nonhemopoietic cells would imply additional functions for this element (4, 5).
we previously reported on a patient affected with x-scid who
received a bone marrow transplantation late at 5.2 years of age. in
this patient, short stature became evident, and a peripheral growth
hormone (gh) hyporesponsiveness associated with abnormalities
of the protein phosphorylation events that occur following gh
receptor (ghr) stimulation was demonstrated.
the ghr was the first identified member of the cytokine receptor class 1 superfamily, which includes receptors for erythropoietin, g-csf, gm-csf, il-2–7, il-9,  xxxg1162xxx , il-12, and many
other cytokines. due to the lack of intrinsic kinase activity, members of the cytokine receptor superfamily recruit and/or activate
cytoplasmic tyrosine kinases to relay their cellular signal. the
jak2 represents the predominant nonreceptor  xxxg2198xxx  required for the initiation of gh signal transduction upon ligand
binding to the receptor (6, 7). however, gh also stimulates tyrosine phosphorylation of  xxxg1219xxx  (8, 9) and  xxxg1221xxx  (10) in certain
cell lines. signal transduction through ghr also involves a wide
array of molecules, such as stats 1, 3, and 5, erk 1 and 2, and
pi3k-protein kinase b (7). activation of  xxxg2216xxx  is considered a
prominent event in gh signaling and is crucial for the regulation
of transcription of gh-responsive genes, including the gene encoding for insulin-like growth factor (igf)-i, which mediates
many of the gh biological functions (11–13). in our previous
study, mutational screening and expressional analysis failed to reveal any molecular alteration of ghr, jak2, and stat5a/b genes in
the patient with x-scid and peripheral gh hyporesponsiveness (14).
because we hypothesized a role for the ␥c in ghr signaling, in
this study, we evaluate the functional interaction between ghr

we previously reported on an x-linked scid (x-scid) patient, who also had peripheral  xxxd3223xxx  (gh) hyporesponsiveness and abnormalities of the protein phosphorylation events following  xxxg890xxx  (ghr) stimulation. in the present study, we
examined a potential role of common cytokine receptor ␥-chain (␥c) in ghr signaling using ebv-transformed lymphocytes from
healthy subjects and ␥c-negative x-scid patients. we demonstrated that the proliferative response to gh stimulation of the b cell
lines of ␥c-negative patients was impaired despite a comparable cellular expression of ghr molecules to controls. in patients, after
gh stimulation, no phosphorylation of  xxxg2216xxx  was observed. in addition, the molecule localization through confocal microscopy
revealed that in b cell lines of patients no nuclear translocation of  xxxg2216xxx  following gh stimulation occurred differently from
controls. biochemical analysis of the nuclear extracts of ␥c-negative cell lines provided further evidence that the amount of
 xxxg2216xxx  and its phosphorylated form did not increase following gh stimulation. in patients, cells reconstituted with wild-type ␥c
abnormal biochemical and functional events were restored resulting in nuclear translocation of  xxxg2216xxx . confocal experiments
revealed that ghr and ␥c were colocalized on the cell membrane. our study demonstrates the existence of a previously unappreciated relationship between ghr-signaling pathway and ␥c, which is required for the activation of  xxxg2216xxx  in b cell lines.
these data also confirm that growth failure in x-scid is primarily related to the genetic alteration of the  xxxg1176xxx  gene. the

and the common ␥ element in either freshly isolated or ebv-transformed lymphocytes from x-scid patients and healthy subjects.
in particular, the functional response to gh stimulation, the pattern
of ghr-induced protein tyrosine phosphorylation and gh-induced translocation from the cytoplasm to the nucleus of  xxxg2216xxx 
were evaluated. we demonstrate the existence of a previously unappreciated functional interaction between ␥c and ghr. this interaction leads to the activation and intranuclear translocation of
the  xxxg2216xxx  protein.

materials and methods
reagents

cells and cell cultures
mononuclear cells (pbmc) were obtained from four x-scid patients and
normal donors and heparinized peripheral blood by  xxxd3253xxx -hypaque (biochrom) density gradient centrifugation. upon informed consent, lymphoblastoid cell lines (bcls) were generated by ebv immortalization of patients and control pbmc using standard procedures (15). in all cases, ␥c
mutations led to the absence of protein expression. cells were maintained
in rpmi 1640 (biochrom) supplemented with 10% fbs (invitrogen life
technologies), 2 mm/l l-glutamine (invitrogen life technologies), and
50 ␮g/ml gentamicin (invitrogen life technologies), and cultured at 37°c,
5% co2. in bcl transduction experiments, the pgc2r␥ retroviral vector
(16) was used to transduce x-scid bcls with wild-type (wt) ␥c as previously described (17). transduced cells were selected in the neomycinanalog  xxxg418xxx  (cellgro). nih 3t3 fibroblasts were used in a few
experiments.

proliferative assay
bcls (1 ⫻ 105 cell/200 ␮l well) were cultured triplicate in 96-well ubottom microtiter plates (falcon; bd biosciences) with or without rgh at
reported concentrations for 4 days. the proliferative response was evaluated by thymidine uptake from cultured cells pulsed with 0.5 ␮ci of
[3h]thymidine (amersham biosciences) 8 h before harvesting (18). in neutralization experiments, control ebv cells were preincubated with the neutralizing mab 284 at the concentration of 6 ng/ml for 3 h or with the igg1
isotype-matched ab (leu 3).

flow cytometry
the expression of ghr was detected using specific rabbit abs (santa cruz
biotechnology) by indirect immunofluorescence using a second-step incubation with fitc-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit abs (pierce). after washing in pbs, cells were incubated for 20 min with the specific abs and 30
min with secondary abs. after staining, all samples were washed in pbs
and acquired on the facscan flow cytometer (bd biosciences) using lysis i software.

cell stimulation and protein extraction
before hormone treatment, the cells were made quiescent through incubation in rpmi 1640 minus serum for 8 –12 h. gh was used at 37°c at a
concentration of 500 ng/ml in rpmi 1640 for the reported time. incubations were terminated by washing cells with ice-cold pbs (biowhittaker)
followed by solubilization in 100 ␮l of lysis solution containing 20 mm
tris (ph 8), 137 mm nacl, 1% nonidet p-40, 10 mm edta, 1 mm
pmsf, 1 mm sodium orthovanadatum (na3vo4), 5 ␮g/ml leupeptin, and
5 ␮g/ml aprotinin. the cell lysates were stored at ⫺80°c for western blot
analysis. nuclear extracts were prepared by the method of andrews et al.
(19) and were subsequently mixed with sample buffer.

western blot
immunoblotting using  xxxd1075xxx  mab was performed as previously
reported (14). immunoblotting using specific ab was performed according
to the vendor protocols. in brief, protein samples separated by sds-page
were transferred onto mixed cellulose esters membranes (immobilon-nc
mixed cellulose esters 0.45 ␮m; millipore). the membrane was incubated
at room temperature for 1 h in blocking buffer consisting of 10% bsa in
wash buffer (10 mm tris (ph 7.5), 100 mm nacl, and 0.1% tween 20).
the membrane was then washed three times in wash buffer and incubated
1 h at room temperature or overnight at 4°c with the specific ab. the
membrane was then washed three times and an appropriate igg hrpconjugated secondary ab was used for the second incubation. after further
washings, the membrane was developed with ecl-developing reagents,
and exposed to x-ray films according to the manufacturer’s instructions
(amersham biosciences).

confocal microscopy
after appropriate stimulation, quiescent cells were rinsed in ice-cold pbs
and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 m phosphate buffer (ph 7.0) for
30 min at room temperature. after four rinses of 5 min in pbs, the cells
were centrifuged in a shandon cytospin iii (histotronix) onto a glass slide
and permeabilized by incubation in a 0.2% triton x-100 solution for 20
min. the cells were then incubated for 1 h at room temperature with rabbit
abs against  xxxg2216xxx  diluted 1/100 in pbs containing 1% bsa. after four
washings for 5 min in pbs, the cells were incubated for 1 h at room
temperature with a 1/200 dilution of fitc-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit
igg (pierce) in pbs. after washing in pbs, the glass slides were mounted
under a coverslip in a 50% glycerol/50% pbs solution. the slides were
analyzed by laser scanning confocal microscopy, using a zeiss lsm 510
version 2.8 sp1 confocal system.

results
effect of gh on the proliferative response of ebv-transformed
cell lines from normal subjects and ␥c-negative x-scid patients
it has been reported that gh enhances ebv-transformed cell line
proliferation in vitro, its effect being direct and not mediated by
 xxxg1144xxx  (18). thus, to evaluate a biological role of ␥c in ghr signaling, we evaluated the response of ebv-transformed lymphocytes (bcls) from ␥c-negative x-scid patients and normal controls to gh stimulation. as shown in fig. 1a, gh enhanced
proliferation of bcls of control subjects in a dose-dependent fashion. significant enhancement of [3h]thymidine uptake was observed at a gh concentration of 50 ng/ml, and the maximal effect
was achieved at 200 ng/ml. in contrast, ␥c-negative bcls did not
respond at any gh concentration. to rule out that the observed
phenomena were due to different numbers of the receptor molecules on the cell membrane, ghr expression was evaluated by
flow cytometry analysis of the cells of controls and patients (fig.
1b). no difference was found in the mean fluorescence intensity
(130.99 ⫾ 28.19 vs 139.88 ⫾ 33.49 in patients and controls, respectively; p ⫽ ns) and in the percentage of positively stained
cells (99.6 vs 99.7% and 99.8 vs 99.9%, respectively).
moreover, to demonstrate a link between the ␥c and ghr, we
used a neutralizing mab in the proliferative assay. as shown in the
fig. 1c, the neutralizing mab inhibited by 64% the proliferative
response to gh. a nonspecific effect of the ab was ruled out,
because the igg1  xxxd2676xxx  isotype-matched ab was ineffective in
inhibiting cell proliferation.
to define whether pi3k had a role on gh-induced cell proliferation of bcls to gh, the kinase inhibitor  xxxd3536xxx  was used.
as shown in fig. 1d, no inhibitory effect was appreciable. by
contrast, in the positive control  xxxd3536xxx  was able to inhibit
fibroblast proliferation to egf by 85%.
to ascertain whether ␥c was linked to ghr, we then assessed by
confocal microscopy the plasma membrane expression of these
two molecules. as shown in fig. 1d, by indirect immunofluorescence using specific abs, as previously detailed, colocalization of
␥c and ghr was observed on the cell surface of normal bcl cells.

bcls were resuspended in lysis buffer. after sds-page and western
blot, membranes were incubated with anti- xxxd1075xxx  abs.

ghr signal transduction pattern
the three main signal modules by which signal transduction
through ghr occurs involve mapk/ xxxg1369xxx  and 2, jak2, stat1,
stat3 and  xxxg2216xxx  and the pi3k-protein kinase b signaling (7).
to evaluate whether the ␥c was involved in ghr-signaling
events, we first focused on  xxxg2216xxx  molecule. as shown in fig. 3,
in the bcls of controls, tyrosine phosphorylation of  xxxg2216xxx  was
evident, with a peak of activity observed between 5 and 15 min
after gh stimulation. by contrast, in the bcls of patients, no
phosphorylation of  xxxg2216xxx  was detectable after stimulation. in all
cell lines examined,  xxxg2216xxx  and stat5a protein expression was
comparable in patients and controls.
to define whether the blockage in ghr signaling was specific
of  xxxg2216xxx  or involved other molecules as well, we then studied
jak2, stat1, erks, and stat3 phosphorylation (fig. 4). no
difference in the phosphorylation events between the bcls of patients and controls was appreciable. as shown, the expression of
the molecules was comparable in control and patient cells.

figure 4. phosphorylation events induced through ghr stimulation.
bcls from x-scid patients and healthy subjects, starved of serum for
8 –12 h, were stimulated for the indicated time with rgh at the concentration of 500 ng/ml. after sds-page and western blot, membranes were
incubated with (a) anti-pjak2 or anti-jak2, (b) anti-pstat1 or antistat1, (c) anti-perk or anti- xxxg1366xxx , (d) anti-pstat3 or anti-stat3.

shown in fig. 4, under basal conditions all cells displayed fluorescent staining of the cytoplasm indicating the presence of
 xxxg2216xxx  in this compartment, and only a negligible staining of
nucleus indicating absence of  xxxg2216xxx  in this compartment. stimulation with gh for the time indicated induced nuclear translocation of  xxxg2216xxx  in the bcls of controls, as demonstrated by the
marked increase in  xxxg2216xxx  immunoreactivity within the nucleus
and not in ␥c-negative bcls.
we next evaluated by immunoblot of nuclear and cytoplasmic
extracts the amount of  xxxg2216xxx  translocation and compared it with
the tyrosine phosphorylation of the molecule. as shown in fig. 5,
in control cells, gh stimulation determined a rapid increase of
nuclear  xxxg2216xxx  amount. the translocation occurred early being
evident 5 min after gh stimulation. moreover, it still persisted 30
min after stimulation. the translocation paralleled the amount of
the tyrosine-phosphorylated form of the protein into the nuclei.
this was inversely correlated with the amount of the cytoplasmic
form of the molecule. however, after 30 min, the reconstitution of
the cytoplasmic aliquot became evident. in the patient cells, no
changes were observed (fig. 6).

 xxxg2216xxx  nuclear translocation after ghr triggering
recently, it has been reported that tyrosine phosphorylation of
stats molecules was not sufficient for the activation of the protein (20, 21). because the activated  xxxg2216xxx  translocates into the
nuclei, confocal microscopy was initially used to test the subcellular localization of  xxxg2216xxx  in control and patient ␥c-negative
cells under resting conditions and after stimulation with gh.
bcls of patients and controls were stimulated with gh for 30
min, fixed, and incubated with antiserum against  xxxg2216xxx . as

rgh stimulation failed to induce  xxxg2216xxx  tyrosine phosphorylation in ␥cnegative bcls. bcls from x-scid patients and healthy subjects were

37°c for the indicated time. after sds-page and western blot, membranes were incubated with anti-pstat5, anti- xxxg2216xxx , or anti-stat5a abs.

cell, focusing particularly on whether this protein was present in the nuclei.

proteins of ⬃90 kda, presumably corresponding to stat molecules involved in the signal transduction through ghr. this pattern of protein tyrosine phosphorylation was also observed in
freshly isolated pbmc from a healthy subject and a patient stimulated with the same concentration and for the same time, thus
confirming the observation on bcls (data not shown).

gh-induced signaling and  xxxg2216xxx  nuclear translocation in
x-scid ebv cells transduced with the wt ␥c gene
we next evaluated whether reconstitution of x-scid cells with
wt ␥c led to a functional recovery. as shown in fig. 7a, pgc2r␥
cells expressed ␥c at a normal extent. these cells proliferated in a
comparable fashion to control cells following gh stimulation (fig.
7b). moreover, in wb experiments using an anti-phospho- xxxg2216xxx 
ab, a phosphorylation of the molecule was observed in pgc2r␥
cells (fig. 7c). finally, in reconstituted cells, gh stimulation induced
a normal nuclear translocation of  xxxg2216xxx , as shown in fig. 7d.

discussion
in the present study, we examined a potential role of the ␥c chain
in ghr signaling using bcls from healthy control subjects and
␥c-negative x-scid patients. at a functional level, gh enhanced
proliferation of control bcls in a dose-dependent fashion. by contrast, the functional response to gh of the bcls of ␥c-negative
patients was severely impaired despite a comparable cellular expression of ghr molecules.
the overall signal transduction properties of ghr in x-scid
patients and control bcls following gh stimulation was also examined by analyzing the pattern of protein tyrosine phosphorylation. in contrast to what was observed in control bcls, in patients,
gh stimulation failed to induce phosphorylation of proteins of 90
kda identified as belonging to the stat molecules family, involved in the signal transduction through ghr. in particular, after
gh stimulation no phosphorylation of  xxxg2216xxx  protein was observed in the cell lines of ␥c-negative patients in contrast to the
control cells, in which a prompt activation of  xxxg2216xxx  occurred. of
note, reconstitution of x-scid cells with the wt ␥c gene corrected the functional and biochemical abnormalities resulting in an
appropriate nuclear translocation of  xxxg2216xxx . these findings
strongly support an essential role of ␥c in ghr signaling.
stat-dependent pathways are generally believed to be used in
cellular events such as cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis (22, 23), even though the overall role of the stat molecules in ghr signal transduction has not been fully elucidated. at
least three different stat family members (stat1, stat3, and
 xxxg2216xxx ) are activated following ghr perturbation (24 –29), even
though  xxxg2216xxx  seems to play a prominent role in receptor signaling. rodent models of stat knockouts (30) and the recent identification of a patient with a homozygous missense mutation of the

mutation also had clinical features of immune deficiency such as
chronic diarrhea and severe infections, including interstitial pneumopathy. immunologic studies showed hypergammaglobulinemia
and markedly decreased  xxxg1175xxx ␣-chain expression in response to
il-2 stimulation, suggestive of a t cell activation defect. thus, a
few features are similar to ␥c-negative x-scid patients.

hemopoietic cell differentiation and functioning remains to be elucidated. of note, in cd34⫹ progenitors, ␥c participates in hemopoietic cell differentiation by interacting with  xxxg527xxx ␤. this
interaction does not occur in normal nk cells or nonhemopoietic
cells (43). hence, the complexity of receptor signaling relies not
only on the possibility that individual receptors interact one with
each other, but also on a differential array of distinct subunits that
may represent a hallmark of that specific cell type.
our current study also explains what we previously reported on
an atypical x-scid phenotype and severe short stature associated
with gh hyporesponsiveness and abnormal ghr-induced protein
tyrosine phosphorylation (14), and indicates that growth failure in
x-scid is directly related to the genetic alteration.

although the activation of jaks and stats represents a prominent biochemical event during gh-dependent proliferation of
lymphoid cell lines (32), other signaling pathways also contribute
to a full ghr response. gh has been shown to activate the pi3kprotein kinase b signaling (33), mapks, and erks 1 and 2 (34 –
36). in both  xxxg2216xxx  knockout mouse and in the patient with
 xxxg2216xxx  mutation, these pathways are fully functional. in keeping
with this observation, also in our experimental model, no alteration
was observed in erk 1 and 2 expression and phosphorylation
events involving jak2, erks, stat1 and 3 molecules that occur
following ghr triggering. moreover, in this study, the involvement of pi3k in gh-induced proliferation of bcls was ruled out
because the kinase inhibitor  xxxd3536xxx  was ineffective in blocking the proliferative response. similarly,  xxxg1144xxx  expression has
been reported to be dependent on  xxxg2216xxx  b, but not on the pi3k
pathway (37). taken together, these observations imply that ghr,
as well as other receptors, is able to integrate different pathways
which are individually differentially regulated. in support of this, it
has been recently shown that ghr signaling and the subsequent
 xxxg1144xxx  transcription regulation are under different regulatory controls in hepatocytes, fibroblasts, and myoblasts (38). this could
lead to a hypothesis of differential functions of an individual receptor exerted in different tissues. a cell type-restricted stat activation has been reported (39 – 41).  xxxg2216xxx  is not activated following gh stimulation in human fibrosarcoma cells even though
these cells express the  xxxg2216xxx  protein (41), thus implying that a
selectivity in the involvement of specific stat subset seems to be
a general feature of ghr signal transduction.
overall, activation of  xxxg2216xxx  is considered a prominent event
in ghr signaling and is crucial for the regulation of transcription
of gh-responsive genes, including the gene encoding for  xxxg1144xxx .
this process relies on an appropriate phosphorylation and nuclear
translocation of the molecule (7, 42). recently, it has been proposed that stats tyrosine phosphorylation and nuclear translocation are two events that are regulated separately (21). in particular,
giron-michel et al. (43) demonstrated in the hybrid receptor ␥c/
 xxxg527xxx ␤ that the ␥c/ xxxg1221xxx  complex controls the nuclear translocation of pstat5 rather than  xxxg2216xxx  phosphorylation itself.
hence, to address the issue of defining the functional implication
of ␥c mutation on  xxxg2216xxx  activation, in our study, the subcellular
localization of  xxxg2216xxx  was investigated by analyzing cytokineinduced translocation of  xxxg2216xxx  from the cytoplasm to the nucleus with confocal microscopy. stimulation with gh induced nuclear translocation of  xxxg2216xxx  in the control cells, whereas no
efficient nuclear translocation occurred in ␥c-negative cells. furthermore, immunoblot of nuclear and cytoplasmic extracts showed
in control cells a rapid increase of the nuclear fraction of the
 xxxg2216xxx  molecule after gh stimulation, which paralleled the molecule phosphorylation, differently from what was observed in patient cells. moreover, through confocal microscopy studies, we
demonstrated that ghr and ␥c colocalize, as expected in that both
molecules are type i hemopoietin receptors. a physical interaction
may be hypothesized as well, even though conclusive data are still
lacking.
our data suggest that the ␥c chain is a required signaling subunit
of the ghr complex in b cell lines. in particular, in this cell line,
it is selectively required for  xxxg2216xxx  phosphorylation and nuclear
translocation, and not for the activation of other molecules as erks.
our study demonstrates the existence of a previously unappreciated relationship between individually well-studied elements,
such as ghr and ␥c, and signaling pathways. cross-talk between
receptor signaling systems is now emerging as an important and
exciting area of signaling research. whether the participation of ␥c
to the ghr confers some additional properties to the receptor in

functional interaction between ␥c and ghr
