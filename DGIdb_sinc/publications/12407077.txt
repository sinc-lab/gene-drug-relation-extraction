(cftr)* is an ion channel that conducts cl ions (for
review see sheppard and welsh, 1999). malfunction of
cftr, due to mutations of the gene coding for cftr,
results in cystic fibrosis (riordan et al., 1989). it is suggested, from hydropathy studies, that cftr consists of
two membrane-spanning domains, each of which contains six transmembrane segments that are thought to
form the anion-selective pore. in addition to these two
membrane-spanning domains, there are two nucleotide-binding domains (nbd1 and nbd2) that presumably carry out the atp hydrolysis reaction that
gates the channel, and a regulatory domain (r domain), phosphorylation of which regulates channel activity (for review see gadsby et al., 1995).
despite numerous physiological and biophysical studies of cftr functions, the structure of cftr remains
undefined due to a lack of crystal structure. however,
previous investigations using mutagenesis suggest that
the sixth transmembrane segment (tm6) may play an
address correspondence to tzyh-chang hwang, dalton cardiovascular research center, 134 research park, university of missouricolumbia, columbia, mo 65211. fax: (573) 884-4232; e-mail:

important role in forming the pore (tabcharani et al.,
1993; akabas et al., 1994; mansoura et al., 1998). other
transmembrane segments, such as  xxxg2318xxx  (mansoura et
al., 1998) and tm12 (mccarty et al., 1993; mcdonough
et al., 1994) may also contribute to the pore formation.
since large organic anions (e.g., dids, dnds, glutamate, and gluconate) can only block the channel
when applied internally, it is proposed that the cftr
pore is asymmetric with a relatively large internal vestibule to accommodate those sizable blockers (linsdell
and hanrahan, 1996a,b; linsdell et al., 1997). however, a symmetric pore model has been successfully
used to explain the selectivity mechanism among lyotropic anions (smith et al., 1999).
several lines of evidence suggest multi-ion occupancy
of the cftr pore. first, the anomalous mole fraction
effect between cl and thiocyanate (scn), an indication of the existence of multi-ion binding sites, is observed in wild-type cftr (wt-cftr). since this effect is
abolished when the positive charge of arg 347 (a residue in tm6) is neutralized, it is thought that arg 347
forms one of the anion binding sites inside the pore
(tabcharani et al., 1993). second, inhibition of the
cftr channel by internally applied blockers is affected
by changing extracellular [cl] (linsdell et al., 1997;
sheppard and robinson, 1997; zhou et al., 2001b).
since the off rate of the blocker is increased by increasing extracellular [cl], this trans-ion effect can be

a b s t r a c t the  xxxg437xxx  (cftr) is an ion channel that conducts
cl current. we explored the cftr pore by studying voltage-dependent blockade of the channel by two organic
anions:  xxxd2215xxx  and isethionate. to simplify the kinetic analysis, a cftr mutant, k1250a-cftr, was used
because this mutant channel, once opened, can remain open for minutes. dose–response relationships of both
blockers follow a simple michaelis-menten function with kd values that differ by three orders of magnitude.  xxxd2215xxx  blocks cftr from the intracellular side of the membrane with slow kinetics. both the on and off rates
of  xxxd2215xxx  block are voltage dependent. removing external cl increases affinity of  xxxd2215xxx  due to a
decrease of the off rate and an increase of the on rate, suggesting the presence of a cl binding site external to
the  xxxd2215xxx  binding site. isethionate blocks the channel from the cytoplasmic side with fast kinetics, but has
no measurable effect when applied extracellularly. increasing the internal cl concentration reduces isethionate
block without affecting its voltage dependence, suggesting that cl and isethionate compete for a binding site in
the pore. the voltage dependence and external cl concentration dependence of isethionate block are nearly
identical to those of  xxxd2215xxx  block, suggesting that these two blockers may bind to a common binding site,
an idea further supported by kinetic studies of blocking with  xxxd2215xxx /isethionate mixtures. by comparing
the physical and chemical natures of these two blockers, we propose that cftr channel has an asymmetric pore
with a wide internal entrance and a deeply embedded blocker binding site where local charges as well as hydrophobic components determine the affinity of the blockers.

more potent than some of the known hydrophilic anion blockers, such as gluconate and glutamate (linsdell and hanrahan, 1996b; linsdell et al., 1997). it
blocks the channel from the cytoplasmic side of the
membrane with a voltage dependence that is nearly
identical to that of  xxxd2215xxx . in addition, removing external cl has virtually identical effects on
isethionate and  xxxd2215xxx  blockage. furthermore,
results obtained from experiments using mixtures of
 xxxd2215xxx  and isethionate are consistent with a
model that two blockers compete for a common binding site. structural implications of the cftr pore
based on the comparison of physical and chemical natures of  xxxd2215xxx  and isethionate are discussed.

cell preparation
nih3t3 cells stably expressing k1250a-cftr channels (zeltwanger et al., 1999) were maintained at 37 c and 5% co2 in dulbecco’s modified eagle’s medium (dmem) supplemented with
10% fetal bovine serum. cells were passed twice a week in 25-cm 2
cell culture flasks. 2–5 d before patch-clamp recordings, cells
were plated on small, sterile glass coverslips in 35-mm tissue culture dishes.

single-channel patch-clamp recordings
recording pipette electrodes were prepared with a two-stage vertical puller (narishige) and were then fire polished using a
homemade microforge to yield a pipette resistance of 3–6 m 
when filled with the standard pipette solution. right before the
recording, a glass coverslip with cells grown on was placed into a
continuously perfused chamber on the stage of an inverted microscope (olympus). the standard pipette (external) solution
(154 mm [cl]o) contained (in mm): 140 nmdg-cl, 2 mgcl 2, 5
cacl2, and 10 hepes (ph 7.4 with nmdg). in some experiments, a pipette solution (0 cl pipette solution) that contained
(in mm) 154 nmdg-aspartate, 2 mgso 4, and 10 hepes (ph 7.4
with nmdg) was used to remove cl  in the external solution.
for these experiments, recording pipettes were first filled with
the 0 cl pipette solution and a 6 mm cl pipette solution was
added onto the top portion of the pipette solution. the 6 mm
cl pipette solution contained (in mm): 148 aspartate, 2 mgcl 2,
1 cacl2, and 10 hepes (ph 7.4 with nmdg). cells were perfused with a bath solution containing (in mm): 145 nacl, 5 kcl,
2 mgcl2, 1 cacl2, 5 glucose, 5 hepes, and 20 sucrose (ph 7.4
with naoh). after the establishment of an inside-out configuration, the patch was perfused with a standard internal perfusion
solution (154 mm [cl]i) containing (in mm): 150 nmdg-cl, 2
mgcl2, 10 egta, and 8 tris (ph 7.4 with nmdg). for cl competition experiments, an internal perfusion solution containing
(in mm): 296 nmdg-cl, 2 mgcl2, 10 egta, and 8 tris (ph 7.4
with nmdg) was used.
single-channel currents were recorded at room temperature
(22c) using an epc9 patch-clamp amplifier (heka electronic). current traces were filtered at 100 hz with a built-in
4-pole bessel filter and stored on videotapes. stationary current
recordings were played back without further filtering, digitized at
500 hz, and stored on the hard disk. to quantify fast blockade by
isethionate, currents in response to 1 s voltage ramp ranging
from 120 to 120 mv were recorded, filtered at 100 hz with a
built-in 4-pole bessel filter, and digitized online at 2 khz.

explained by an electrostatic repulsion between the
blocker and the cl ion simultaneously present in the
pore (e.g., zhou et al., 2001b). however, it is also possible that external cl and internally applied blocker
may compete for a common binding site (e.g., sheppard and robinson, 1997). this latter scenario would
predict that the on rate of the blocker is decreased by
increasing extracellular [cl]. thus, to distinguish
these two mechanisms, it is essential to investigate how
external [cl] affects the association and dissociation
rates of the blocker with single-channel kinetic analysis.
third, models with two or three binding sites have
been used successfully to describe gluconate and scn
block of the cftr channel (linsdell et al., 1997). recently, a model with three binding sites is used to explain the role of arg 334, a charged residue in tm6, in
conduction properties (smith et al., 2001). however,
the multi-ion pore notion has been challenged by some
other reports. first, cotton and welsh (1999) conclude
that instead of forming an anion binding site directly,
arg 347 may form a salt bridge with asp 924 to stabilize
the channel architecture. second, the anomalous mole
fraction effect described above is not observed in some
studies (mansoura et al., 1998). in addition, a higher
single-channel conductance with scn as the charge
carrier, observed in earlier experiments demonstrating
the anomalous mole fraction effect (tabcharani et al.,
1993), is recently challenged (linsdell, 2001). third, a
single-ion pore model is shown to adequately explain
the anion selectivity of cftr (smith et al., 1999).
the goal of the current study is to probe the cftr
channel with organic anion blockers to gain some insight into the structural properties of the anion-conducting pore. high affinity blockers have been proven
to be invaluable tools in elucidating the pore structure
of ion channels. the most successful examples are the
well-known  xxxg1232xxx  blockers: tea and its
derivatives (e.g., armstrong, 1971; miller, 1982; choi et
al., 1993). importantly, early biophysical work using
blockers to probe the properties of the ion binding
sites in the  xxxg1232xxx  pore is supported by recent x-ray crystallographic studies of the kcsa  xxxg1232xxx  (doyle et al., 1998; jiang and mackinnon, 2000; zhou et al., 2001a). in this study, two organic anion blockers,  xxxd2215xxx  and isethionate,
were used to probe the cftr pore.  xxxd2215xxx , the
most potent cftr blocker found so far, is an anion
with large hydrophobic components (schultz et al.,
1996; sheppard and robinson, 1997; gupta and linsdell, 2002). here, mechanisms underlying the voltagedependent blockade by  xxxd2215xxx  were studied in
detail using single-channel and whole-cell recordings.
on the other hand, isethionate is an anion that has
been used widely as a cl substitute. our results indicate that isethionate effectively blocks cftr and is

whole-cell patch-clamp recordings
whole-cell recordings were made using an epc9 patch-clamp
amplifier. the standard pipette (internal) solution contained (in
mm): 101 cscl, 2 mgcl2, 20 teacl, 10 mgatp, 8 tris, 10 egta,
and 5.8 glucose (ph 7.4 with csoh). the standard bath (external) solution contained (in mm): 114 nacl, 2 mgcl 2, 1 cacl2, 5
kcl, 5 hepes, 5 glucose, and 70 sucrose (ph 7.4 with naoh). in
those experiments studying external isethionate block, the bath
solution with isethionate contained (in mm): 76 isethionate, 75
nacl, 5 kcl, 5 glucose, 5 hepes, 2 mgcl 2, and 1 cacl2. the control bath solution contained (in mm): 152 sucrose, 75 nacl, 5
kcl, 5 glucose, 5 hepes, 2 mgcl2, and 1 cacl2. 10 m  xxxd1742xxx 
was used to activate the channel activity. pulse and pulsefit program (heka electronic) was used to generate the voltage step
protocol and collect the data. cells were held at 0 mv before the
voltage was stepped to various potentials from 120 to 120 mv
for 500 ms in 20-mv increments, and then back to 0 mv. current
responses were filtered at 5 khz and digitized online  xxxd1891xxx  khz.
steady-state currents were measured as the average current value
of final 50 ms of the voltage step.

for quantitative analysis of  xxxd2215xxx  blockade, channel
open probability (po) was estimated from all-point amplitude
histograms using the pat program (version 7.0, strathclyde
electrophysiology software). single-channel kinetic analysis was
performed using the software written by dr. csanády (csanády,
2000). this program allows extraction of individual rate constants, given a kinetic model. all curve fittings were performed
with igor pro program (version 3.11, wavemetrics) using a
levenberg-marquardt algorithm. for quantitative analysis of
isethionate blockade, net k1250a-cftr single-channel i-v relationships were obtained by subtracting the i-v relationship of
the leak (i.e., basal conductance before the channel is opened)
from that of a single locked-open k1250a-cftr channel. usually, several voltage ramps were applied during a single opening
to generate the i-v relationships. the average of these i-v relationships were then calculated to represent the single-channel
i-v curve of k1250a-cftr. because of the small conductance of
the cftr channel and the extra noise introduced by the
blocker, the signal-to-noise ratio is often jeopardized even when
the current is filtered at 100 hz. therefore, we fit the averaged
single-channel i-v curve with a four term polynomial function
(fitted i-v). fraction of block (fb) was calculated according to
the equation:
fb = 1 – ( i b ) ⁄ ( i o ),
where ib and io represent the fitted values of the block and unblocked current, respectively. since fb of isethionate was obtained in an open channel without interference of fast flickery
block, a simple two state scheme (i.e., open ↔ blocked) was used
for data analysis. dissociation constant ( kd) for isethionate block
can then be calculated according to gupta and linsdell (2002):
k d = ( 1 – fb ) [ isethionate ] ⁄ fb .

(1)

to calculate kd for  xxxd2215xxx  block from single-channel
data, a three state kinetic scheme (i.e., blocked ↔ open ↔
blocked) was used since the presence of fast flickery block in single-channel recordings has to be taken into account (see results for details). the relationship between kd and fb was described by sheppard and robinson (1997) as:

voltage dependence of the on rate (k on[v]) and off rate
(koff[v]) of the blocker was estimated using eqs. 3 and 4 according to the rate theory:
k on ( v ) = k on ( v )′ [ x ] = k on ( 0 )′ [ x ] exp ( zdelta on fv ⁄ rt )

k off ( v ) = k off ( v ) exp ( – z delta off fv ⁄ rt ),

entry barrier, off is the electrical distance of the exit barrier ( on
and off have values between 0 and 1), z is the valence of the
blocker (a value of 1 is assumed for  xxxd2215xxx  and
isethionate), and f, r, and t have their usual thermodynamic
meanings. voltage dependence of kd (kd[v]) was estimated according to the following equation:
k d ( v ) = k off ( v ) ⁄ k on ( v )′
= k off ( 0 ) ⁄ k on ( 0 )′ exp ( – z [ delta on + delta off ]fv ⁄ rt )
= k d ( 0 ) exp ( – z delta kd fv ⁄ rt ),

 xxxd2215xxx  block of k1250a-cftr channels
previous studies show that  xxxd2215xxx  blocks cftr
channels with a time constant in the range of tens of
milliseconds that is slow enough to be resolved in single-channel recordings (schultz et al., 1996; sheppard
and robinson, 1997). however, this time constant of
 xxxd2215xxx  block is very close to the closed time
constant of atp-gated events in wt-cftr (zeltwanger
et al., 1999). thus, unless atp-dependent gating is deliberately retarded, it is very difficult to dissect these
two events kinetically. that  xxxd2215xxx  may affect
cftr gating (zeltwanger et al., 2000) further complicates the analysis and interpretation. to extract the kinetic parameters of  xxxd2215xxx -induced blocking
events with minimal contamination of atp-dependent
gating events, we studied  xxxd2215xxx  block with a
cftr mutant, k1250a-cftr, instead of wt-cftr. the
advantage of using k1250a-cftr is that this channel,
once opened by atp, can stay open for minutes even after a complete removal of atp. by collecting data
within a prolonged channel opening, we can study primarily  xxxd2215xxx -induced blocking events.

we first tested whether  xxxd2215xxx  block of
k1250a-cftr channels is similar to that of wt-cftr
channels. fig. 1 a shows an example of glibenclamideinduced block recorded from an inside-out patch excised from an nih3t3 cell stably expressing k1250acftr. k1250a-cftr currents were first activated by
pka and 1mm atp (not depicted). in this particular
example, at least three channels were activated and
locked open. pka and atp were then removed and
currents were allowed to relax. when there was only

k1250a-cftr channel currents were activated by pka and 1 mm
atp in an excised inside-out patch held at 50 mv with symmetric
cl (154 mm [cl]o/154 mm [cl]i). (a) continuous recording
of k1250a-cftr after the channels were locked open with pka
and atp. 50 m  xxxd2215xxx , applied to the internal solution,

one channel left open, 50 m  xxxd2215xxx  was added
to the superfusion solution.  xxxd2215xxx -induced
block was observed within seconds of the solution
change (presumably limited by the speed of solution
exchange). the block was readily reversed once the
blocker was removed. fig. 1 b shows expanded singlechannel current traces before, during, and after  xxxd2215xxx  application. before application of  xxxd2215xxx , the channel stays in the locked-open state with
occasional brief closings (i.e., flickery blocked state; see
zhou et al., 2001b).  xxxd2215xxx  (50 m) induces
frequent closed events that last for tens of milliseconds.
in this particular experiment, open probability (po)
was reduced from 0.96 to 0.50 in the presence of 50 m
 xxxd2215xxx , and returned to 0.94 after  xxxd2215xxx  was removed. there is no significant difference
between the po values before and after  xxxd2215xxx 
application (fig. 1 c) (p 1.0). therefore,  xxxd2215xxx -induced block in k1250a-cftr channels is completely reversible as seen in wt-cftr (schultz et al.,
1996; sheppard and robinson, 1997; gupta and linsdell, 2002; cf. sheppard and welsh, 1992).
next, we examined the sensitivity of k1250a-cftr to
 xxxd2215xxx  block. fig. 2 a shows representative single-channel current traces in the presence of various
amounts of  xxxd2215xxx . as [ xxxd2215xxx ] is increased, more blocked events are observed. po before and during  xxxd2215xxx  application was obtained from all-point amplitude histograms. fraction
of block (fb) was calculated as 1  pow/  xxxd2215xxx /
pow/o  xxxd2215xxx  (fig. 2 b). the resulting dose–response
relationship can be fitted with a michaelis-menten
function with a k1/2 of 49.4  9.5 m at 50 mv, which
is similar to that reported for wt-cftr (schultz et al.,
1996; sheppard and robinson, 1997), indicating that
the k1250a mutation does not affect the sensitivity of
the channel to  xxxd2215xxx .
we then tested whether  xxxd2215xxx  blocks k1250acftr channels in a voltage-dependent manner as
shown for wt-cftr channels (sheppard and robinson, 1997; gupta and linsdell, 2002). fig. 3 a shows
single-channel current traces at various membrane
potentials in the presence of 50 m  xxxd2215xxx . po
at each voltage was used to calculate fb as described
above. fb increases with hyperpolarization as seen in
wt-cftr (fig. 3 b, top). using eq. 2, we calculated
kd values at various voltages and the resulting data
were fitted with eq. 5 (fig. 3 b, bottom), which yields
a kd of 0.45  0.03. this voltage dependence is similar to those reported previously for wt-cftr (sheppard and robinson, 1997; gupta and linsdell,
2002). we therefore conclude that the mechanisms
of voltage dependence of  xxxd2215xxx  block for
k1250a-cftr channels can also be applied to wtcftr channels.

configuration, 10 m  xxxd1742xxx  was applied to the bath
solution to activate the channels. when whole-cell macroscopic currents reached a steady-state level,  xxxd2215xxx  was added to the superfusion solution. it usually
took several minutes for  xxxd2215xxx  block to reach
its steady-state. fitting the time course of current inhibition with a single exponential function gave an average time constant of 76  13 s (n 3). this prolonged
time course of  xxxd2215xxx  block in the whole-cell
configuration, contrary to the much faster block in inside-out patches (fig. 1 a), is likely due to a slow permeation of  xxxd2215xxx  through the cell membrane.
 xxxd2215xxx , although applied to the extracellular
side of the channel, exerts its blocking effect from the
intracellular side of the channel as proposed by others
(schultz et al., 1996; sheppard and robinson, 1997;
gupta and linsdell, 2002). supporting this notion,
the dose–response relationship of  xxxd2215xxx  block
measured from whole-cell experiments yielded a similar k1/2 as that from single-channel experiments in inside-out patches (unpublished data).
to study the voltage dependence of  xxxd2215xxx 
block in whole-cell configuration, we held the membrane potential at 0 mv and then stepped it to various
voltages from 120 to 120 mv for 500 ms in 20-mv increments. before the application of  xxxd1742xxx  (fig. 4 a,
control), whole-cell basal (leak) conductance is minimal (whole-cell resistance 3.9 g for this particular
652

cell), indicating very little basal cftr channel activity. once the  xxxd1742xxx -activated current reached a
steady-state level, voltage steps were applied again. net
k1250a-cftr current traces were obtained by subtracting the leak from the  xxxd1742xxx -activated current (fig. 4
a). note that the whole-cell current traces are mostly
time independent except at very high negative membrane potentials where fast current relaxations are observed. these time-dependent currents at negative
membrane potentials are caused by an intrinsic voltagedependent flickery block that has been characterized
previously (zhou et al., 2001b; see below). in the presence of 50 m  xxxd2215xxx , in addition to the fast relaxation component, a much slower current relaxation
is observed together with a decrease of the steady-state
current at hyperpolarizing voltages (fig. 4, a and b).
net steady-state i-v relationships in the presence or absence of  xxxd2215xxx  are shown in fig. 4 c. clearly,
 xxxd2215xxx  blocks whole-cell k1250a-cftr currents
in a voltage-dependent manner with more block at negative voltages. fb was calculated from the steady-state
currents and summarized results are shown in fig. 4 d.
the values of fb obtained from single-channel recordings (from fig. 3 b) are superimposed. the agreement
between these two sets of data not only supports the notion that  xxxd2215xxx , even applied extracellularly,
blocks cftr channels from the cytoplasmic side, but

i), the on rate (kon) increases linearly with [ xxxd2215xxx ], whereas the off rate (koff) is little affected by
[ xxxd2215xxx ]. the lines representing the on and off
rates intersect at 49.1 m (i.e., kd), which is nearly
identical to the k1/2, estimated from the dose–response
relationship described above (fig. 2 b). the agreement
between this kd value, obtained from kinetic parameters based on scheme i, and the model-independent
k1/2 further demonstrates that scheme i is adequate for
describing  xxxd2215xxx  block of k1250a-cftr channels.
we then used the same method to obtain kinetic parameters for  xxxd2215xxx  block at various membrane
potentials. visual inspections of the current traces
shown in fig. 3 a suggest that both open and blocked

where o, gb, and fb represent the open state,  xxxd2215xxx -blocked state, and the intrinsic flickery
block state, respectively. kon is the apparent on rate of
 xxxd2215xxx , which is the product of the secondorder rate constant for  xxxd2215xxx  binding (kon)
and [ xxxd2215xxx ], and koff is the off rate of  xxxd2215xxx . the parameters kf and kf are the apparent
on and off rate of the blockade by the intrinsic blocker,
respectively. according to this scheme, the open time
distribution will follow a single exponential function
and the mean open time should be equal to 1/(kon kf),
whereas the closed time distribution will follow a
double exponential function with one component (i.e.,
1/koff) representing the  xxxd2215xxx -induced blocked
events and the other (1/kf) representing the closed
events induced by intrinsic flickery blockings. previous
studies suggest that the mean blocked time of  xxxd2215xxx  is about an order of magnitude longer than
that of the intrinsic blocker (schultz et al., 1996; sheppard and robinson, 1997; zhou et al., 2001b), therefore, we should be able to separate these two components readily.
using the pat analysis program, we constructed
dwell-time histograms from the single-channel recordings in the presence of 12.5 or 50 m  xxxd2215xxx 
(fig. 5 a). as predicted, the open time histograms can
be well fitted with a single exponential function (fig. 5
a, solid curves) and the mean open time decreases with
an increase of [ xxxd2215xxx ]. also consistent with
scheme i, the closed time histograms can be fitted
with a double exponential function (fig. 5 a, solid curves)
with both time constants independent of [ xxxd2215xxx ]. furthermore, as predicted from scheme i, the
fraction of the second component increases as [ xxxd2215xxx ] is increased. these observations justify the
application of scheme i in the data analysis. individual
rate constants for  xxxd2215xxx  block were extracted
with the software developed by dr. csanády (csanády,
2000). fig. 5 b shows the resulting on and off rates of
 xxxd2215xxx  block at various blocker concentrations.

0.28  0.03 from inside of the channel. thus, dissociation of  xxxd2215xxx  seems somewhat more voltage
dependent than association.
it has been shown that changing external [cl] affects the voltage dependence of blockers applied from
inside (linsdell and hanrahan, 1996b; linsdell et al.,
1997; sheppard and robinson, 1997; zhou et al.,
2001b). we therefore examined the effect of extracellular [cl] on  xxxd2215xxx  block. fig. 7 a shows single-channel current traces in the presence of 50 m
 xxxd2215xxx  with external cl removed. compared
with  xxxd2215xxx  block with 154 mm external cl
(fig. 3 a), at any given membrane potential, channels
stay in the open state shorter but in the blocked state
longer. thus, the fb values in the absence of external
cl are higher than those in the presence of external
cl at all tested voltages (i.e., lower kd at each voltage,
fig. 7 b). in addition, the slope of the voltage dependence curve is less steep (estimated kd 0.32  0.05)
in the absence of external cl than that in the presence
of 154 mm external cl (fig. 7 b). results from singlechannel kinetic analysis indicate that both the on and
off rates of  xxxd2215xxx  block are sensitive to the
presence of extracellular cl (fig. 6). in the absence of
extracellular cl, the on rates are larger at all voltages
tested compared with those in the presence of 154 mm
external cl, whereas the off rates become smaller.
nevertheless, both the on and off rates are still voltage
dependent (fig. 6, open symbols). from the voltage dependence of kon and koff, the estimated electrical distances of  xxxd2215xxx  measured from inside of the

voltage-dependent block of k1250a-cftr channels
by isethionate
 xxxd2215xxx  is a powerful tool to probe the cftr
pore because it affords direct measurements of both
the on and off rate constants. however, this advantage
is counteracted by the fact that a considerable singlechannel signal-to-noise ratio is required for kinetic
analysis. in addition, a fairly long duration of singlechannel recording is necessary for collecting sufficient
events. this latter requirement is especially problematic because membrane patches are unstable at relatively positive membrane potentials, precluding detailed quantification of  xxxd2215xxx  block at positive
voltages. we therefore set out to try several hydrophilic
fast blockers to probe the cftr pore.
we screened three large hydrophilic anions: gluconate, glutamate, and isethionate. gluconate and glutamate are known cftr channel blockers (linsdell
and hanrahan, 1996b; linsdell et al., 1997) and they
block cftr channels from intracellular side of the
pore with a fast time scale. on the other hand, isethionate is used commonly as a replacement for cl and
there is no report so far that isethionate blocks cftr
channels. to our surprise, isethionate decreases the
single-channel amplitude as if it also blocks the cftr
pore with a fast time scale (see below). to compare

their ability to block k1250a-cftr channels, we applied voltage ramps on inside-out patches in the presence or absence of various blockers in the perfusion solution. fig. 8 a shows representative i-v curves of control and those in the presence of various blockers. all
three anions block k1250a-cftr channels in a voltagedependent manner. however, at the same concentration (100 mm), isethionate shows the strongest block
among these three anions. for example, at 100 mv,
the values of fb are 0.67  0.01 (n
7), 0.46  0.02
(n
7), and 0.33  0.06 (n
3) for isethionate, gluconate, and glutamate, respectively. therefore, we focused on isethionate for the rest of the study. fig. 8 b
demonstrates that the voltage dependence of  xxxd2215xxx  and isethionate block are very similar despite the
very different time scales of action. indeed, when the
voltage-dependent kd is quantified with eq. 5, the electrical distance, kd, of isethionate block (0.45  0.03) is
identical to that of  xxxd2215xxx .
fig. 9 a shows single-channel i-v curves in the presence of various concentrations of isethionate. the
higher the concentration of isethionate, the smaller the
single-channel amplitude. the values of fb in the presence of different concentrations of isethionate were calculated as described above. the dose–response relationship, when fitted with the michaelis-menten function,
yields a k1/2 of 89.6  3.4 mm at 50 mv (fig. 9 b).
to test whether isethionate can also block the channel from the extracellular side, we applied isethionate

were performed (see fig. 4) and representative current
traces are shown in fig. 10 a. in the presence of 76 mm
isethionate in the external solution, the net whole-cell
currents are similar to those of control. the steady-state
i-v relationships in the absence or presence of external
isethionate are nearly identical (fig. 10 b), indicating
that isethionate, at the tested concentration, has a negligible effect on cftr current when applied from the
external side of the channel.

effect of extracellular and intracellular cl on isethionate block
to investigate whether intracellular cl affects isethionate block, we increased [cl] in the bath solution to 300
mm (since it is technically difficult to maintain the excised patch at lower intracellular [cl]) and tested
isethionate block using the same ramp protocol described above. in the presence of 300 mm intracellular
cl, kd values become larger compared with those in the
presence of 154 mm intracellular cl at all voltages tested
(fig. 11 a). kd, estimated from the voltage dependence
of kd in the presence of 300 mm intracellular cl, is

0.50  0.01, which is similar to that in the presence of
154 mm intracellular cl (fig. 11 a). this result is consistent with the idea that intracellular cl and isethionate
may compete for the same binding site. when the concentration of competing cl ions is increased, less block
and a larger kd are expected because of a lower probability of occupancy by isethionate at its binding site.
to test whether extracellular cl, as in the case of
 xxxd2215xxx  block, affects isethionate block, we replaced cl completely with aspartate in the pipette solution and examined isethionate block. in the absence
of external cl, isethionate block still shows voltage dependence and kd values become smaller compared
with those in the presence of 154 mm external cl

if indeed these two blockers share a common binding
site, then the kinetics of channel blockade by these two
blockers can be described as:

where x, xg, and xi represent the binding site,  xxxd2215xxx -occupied state and isethionate-occupied
state, respectively. kon is the second-order rate constant
for  xxxd2215xxx  binding and koff is the off rate of  xxxd2215xxx . k1 is the off rate of isethionate and k1 is the
second-order rate constant for isethionate binding; [g]
and [i] represent the concentrations of  xxxd2215xxx 
and isethionate respectively. according to scheme ii,
the fractional block in the presence of both  xxxd2215xxx  and isethionate (fbg i) is given by:
k d(l) [ g ] + k d(g) [ i ]
-,
fb g + 1 = ---------------------------------------------------------------------------k d(l) [ g ] + k d(g) [ i ] + k d(g) k d(l)

where kd(g) and kd(i) are the dissociation constants of
 xxxd2215xxx  and isethionate, respectively. since both
kd(g) and kd(i) are known, we can calculate fbg i at different combinations of  xxxd2215xxx  and isethionate
and experimentally verify the predictions. fig. 12 a
shows representative single-channel current traces and
corresponding all-point amplitude histograms at –50
mv. in the presence of 6.25 m  xxxd2215xxx  plus 20
mm isethionate, both po and single-channel amplitude
decrease compared with those of control. when the
concentrations of the blockers are increased, po and
single-channel amplitude further decrease. fbg i was
calculated as the ratio of the mean current, which takes
into account both po and the single-channel amplitude, in the presence of blockers and that in the absence of blockers. in all four different combinations of
these two blockers, the experimentally measured fbg i
are in good agreement with the theoretical values

based on scheme ii (fig. 12 b). scheme ii also predicts
that the apparent on rate of  xxxd2215xxx  would decrease in the presence of isethionate since  xxxd2215xxx  cannot bind when isethionate occupies the binding site, but the off rate would not be affected by
isethionate. since isethionate, being a fast blocker, reduces the single-channel amplitude and introduces extra open channel noise, we were only able to reliably
perform our single-channel kinetic analysis at a low
concentration of isethionate. our results show that in
the presence of 20 mm isethionate, the apparent on
rate of  xxxd2215xxx  (6.25 m) is 1.38  0.10 s1 (n
5), which is significantly slower than that in the presence of 6.25 m  xxxd2215xxx  alone (1.83  0.06 s1,
n 4, see fig. 5 b) (p 0.05). in fact, this value of  xxxd2215xxx  on rate in the presence of 20 mm isethionate is very close to the predicted value, 1.49 s1, based
on scheme ii. on the other hand, the off rate of  xxxd2215xxx  in the presence of isethionate is 10.97 
0.53 s1 (n 5), which is not different from that in the
absence of isethionate (11.07  0.86 s1, n 4, see fig.

the goal of this study is to use the anion blockers,  xxxd2215xxx  and isethionate, to probe the cftr channel
pore in order to understand the pore structure. we
found that these two blockers, despite of their drastic
differences in potency and blocking kinetics, show very
similar voltage dependence and sensitivity to changes
of external cl concentration. both anions block the
658

cftr channel from the cytoplasmic side of the membrane presumably traversing a significant distance into
the pore to their binding site.
with the k1250a-cftr mutant, we were able to
quantify detailed kinetic parameters of  xxxd2215xxx 
block not provided by previous studies (schultz et al.,
1996; sheppard and robinson, 1997; gupta and linsdell, 2002). our results demonstrate that both the on
rate and the off rate of  xxxd2215xxx  are voltage dependent (fig. 6). in the presence of 154 mm external
cl, the electrical distance estimated from the on rate
and the off rate are 0.16 and 0.28, respectively. the
sum of these two values is close to the measured kd
(kd
0.45), as predicted (see materials and methods). this latter value is similar to those derived from
the voltage-dependent kd reported previously for wtcftr (
0.48, sheppard and robinson, 1997; 
0.41, gupta and linsdell, 2002). it should be noted
that voltage-dependent blockade might not solely reflect the fact that the binding site of the blocker is in
the electrical field. studies of k channels demonstrate
that the voltage dependence of a blocker can be affected by the permeant ions entering the pore from the
opposite side of the channel (e.g., armstrong, 1971;
yellen, 1984; mackinnon and miller, 1988; spassova
and lu, 1998). this trans-ion effect has also been
shown in cftr channels. external cl concentration
can affect the voltage-dependent block by  xxxd2215xxx  (sheppard and robinson, 1997; gupta and linsdell, 2002), glutamate, and gluconate (linsdell and
hanrahan, 1996b; linsdell et al., 1997). we have also

lar to each other, indicating that their voltage dependence is equally sensitive to changes of external cl
concentration. third, when  xxxd2215xxx  and isethionate are applied together (fig. 12), the resulting
fbg i are compatible with the predicted values based
on scheme ii that  xxxd2215xxx  and isethionate compete for a common binding site. although scheme ii
seems reasonable, we cannot completely rule out the
possibility that  xxxd2215xxx  and isethionate may actually bind to two different sites that are very close to
each other in the pore. thus, both blockers can reside
in the pore simultaneously. however, it seems difficult
to envision that isethionate is able to enter a  xxxd2215xxx -occupied pore (and vice versa), since both blockers are fairly large in size. furthermore, if indeed both
blockers can bind at the same time while binding of
one blocker does not affect binding of the other, the
predicted fbg i values will be higher than those predicted from scheme ii. our experimental data are consistently closer to the values predicted from scheme ii,
and are always smaller than those based on a model
with two binding sites (unpublished data). computational modeling based on the crystal structure, when
available, would be able to differentiate between these
two possibilities. studies using mutants that affect  xxxd2215xxx  and isethionate may also be useful.
if we accept the concept of one common binding site
for both  xxxd2215xxx  and isethionate, we are able to
make some speculations about the cftr pore based
on the structural differences between these two blockers.  xxxd2215xxx  (c23h27cln3o5s) is a large hydrophobic anion, whereas isethionate (c2h5o4s) is a relatively small hydrophilic anion. the physical dimensions of both blockers are estimated using a program
written by dr. xiaoqin zou (university of missouri).
briefly, the three-dimensional coordinates are generated by the concord software (rusinko et al., 1989)
that determines the minimal and maximal coordinates
that are occupied by a molecule along the x, y, and z
axis, respectively. the molecular dimensions are then
derived from these coordinates. the estimated dimensions of  xxxd2215xxx  and isethionate are 21.4 å
13.6 å 11.6 å and 8.1 å 5.8 å 6.2 å, respectively.
the slow on rate of  xxxd2215xxx  (on the order of 105
s1m1) is probably due to its large size. thus, a special
orientation of  xxxd2215xxx  may be required for the
blocker to move across the internal entrance of the
pore. the on rate of isethionate is likely to be faster
than that of  xxxd2215xxx  if we assume size is a main
determinant of the on rate. even if the on rate of both
blockers are the same, the off rate of  xxxd2215xxx  is
at least a thousandfold slower than that of isethionate,
since the kd of  xxxd2215xxx  is about three orders of
magnitude smaller than that of isethionate. the slower
off rate of  xxxd2215xxx  suggests that  xxxd2215xxx

flickery blocking events seen in a locked-open k1250acftr channel is mostly determined by the trans-ion effects (zhou et al., 2001b). we tested the effect of external cl on kinetic parameters of  xxxd2215xxx  block.
our results show that the affinity of  xxxd2215xxx , as
judged by kd values, increases when external cl is removed (fig. 7 b). detailed kinetic analysis show that
the on rate of  xxxd2215xxx  becomes faster and the off
rate becomes slower in the absence of external cl
(fig. 6). these observations suggest the presence of a
cl binding site external to the site for  xxxd2215xxx 
in the cftr pore. binding of cl ions at this external
site destabilizes  xxxd2215xxx  binding.
it should be noted that scheme i is the simplest
model that is adequate to explain our results. we cannot rule out the possibility of other more complicated
schemes. for example, the channel may be occupied by
 xxxd2215xxx  and the intrinsic blocker simultaneously.
one would then expect three components in the
closed time distribution. that the closed time distribution can be fitted quite well with a double exponential
function (fig. 5 a) suggests that if indeed the third
component exists, it is not resolved under our experimental conditions. unfortunately, the molecular nature of the intrinsic blocker remains a mystery. future
identification of the intrinsic blocker will permit differentiation of different kinetic schemes. nevertheless,
this limitation applied to  xxxd2215xxx  blockade is not
a concern for isethionate block because the block is assessed without a contamination of flickery block.
the voltage-dependent block of the cftr pore is
also seen with isethionate, a hydrophilic organic anion
commonly used as a cl substitute. like other large hydrophilic anions, such as gluconate and glutamate
(linsdell and hanrahan, 1996b; linsdell et al., 1997),
isethionate blocks cftr channels in a voltage-dependent manner with a fast time scale. surprisingly, isethionate is more potent than the two well-characterized
blockers, gluconate and glutamate (fig. 8 a). the kd of
isethionate at 100 mv is 48.7 mm compared with a kd
(100 mv) of 80 mm for gluconate (linsdell and
hanrahan, 1996b; linsdell et al., 1997) and a kd (100
mv) of 325 mm for glutamate (linsdell and hanrahan,
1996b). therefore, isethionate can be considered as a
new tool to probe the cftr pore.
 xxxd2215xxx  and isethionate block cftr channels
with different kinetics, and their binding affinities differ by three orders of magnitude. however, our results
suggest that these two blockers may share a common
binding site. first, the voltage dependence of  xxxd2215xxx  block and isethionate block are nearly identical
in the presence of 154 mm external cl (fig. 8, b and
c). second, in the absence of external cl, the estimated kd values for both blockers are again very simi-

(dpc),  xxxd2122xxx  (ffa), and  xxxd2215xxx , are
effective when applied to either side of the membrane.
however, since these blockers are membrane permeant
and it usually takes several minutes for them to exhibit
a full blocking effect, it is likely that these blockers,
even when applied extracellularly, actually block the
channel from inside (sheppard and welsh, 1992; mccarty et al., 1993; schultz et al., 1996; sheppard and
robinson, 1997). our results from single-channel recordings and whole-cell recordings indeed support the
idea that  xxxd2215xxx , even applied extracellularly,
enters the channel from the intracellular side of the
pore. only small permeant molecules, such as scnand au(cn)2, have been observed to block the channel from either side of the membrane (tabcharani et
al., 1993; mansoura et al., 1998; smith et al., 1999;
gong et al., 2002; linsdell and gong, 2002; unpublished data). together, cftr channel pore may adopt
an asymmetric structure with a relatively large internal
tunnel and a fairly narrow external entrance. the existence of a stringent external entrance may provide
some evolutionary advantages since cftr is normally
present in the apical membranes of intestinal epithelia and thus is exposed to a multitude of potential
blockers.
the presence of a large internal tunnel allows us to
make another structural prediction. since the diameter
of this internal tunnel has to be at least 11 å, whereas
previous biophysical studies suggest a narrowest region
(i.e., selectivity filter) of 6 å in the cftr pore (linsdell
and hanrahan, 1996a), the selectivity filter should
be located external to the  xxxd2215xxx /isethionate
binding site because our data provide no evidence that
 xxxd2215xxx  or isethionate can pass through the
channel. with the addition of this implied structural information, one can speculate that an open cftr pore
structure may show some resemblance to the recently
resolved open-channel structure of the k channels
(jiang et al., 2002).
several of our results support the notion that cftr
channel has a pore that can be occupied simultaneously by multiple anions. first, effects of both blockers are sensitive to changes of external cl concentration. removing external cl enhances both  xxxd2215xxx  and isethionate block (figs. 7 b and 11 b).
detailed kinetic analysis shows that the off rate of  xxxd2215xxx  is faster in the presence of external cl (fig.
6). we reason that cl ions can enter the pore from the
external side to destabilize  xxxd2215xxx  binding.
thus, the pore can be occupied by cl and  xxxd2215xxx  simultaneously and there is at least one cl binding site external to the  xxxd2215xxx /isethionate binding site. this is also consistent with the picture described above that the selectivity filter (by definition a
cl binding site) is located external to the blocker

can bind much more stably to its binding site than
isethionate. since  xxxd2215xxx  has three hydrophobic rings that are lacking in isethionate, we propose
that there are likely to be some hydrophobic components in the pore that stabilize  xxxd2215xxx  binding.
larger van der waal’s interactions between  xxxd2215xxx  and the pore may also attribute to the tight binding. on the other hand, the negative charge of the
blockers is also important, as indicated by previous research (sheppard and robinson, 1997). therefore,
positive charge as well as hydrophobic components in
the pore are important for a stable binding of the
blocker in the cftr pore. it should be noted that this
conclusion is valid irrespective of whether  xxxd2215xxx  and isethionate bind to the same site or two
nearby sites. interestingly, based on studies with alkyltea derivatives, choi et al. (1993) made a similar conclusion on the pore structure of shaker potassium channels. the presence of hydrophobic segment(s) in the
aqueous pore is perhaps important to prevent cftr
channels from being blocked by hydrophilic anions
(e.g., glutamate) present under physiological conditions in the cell.
in order for a blocker as large as  xxxd2215xxx  to enter the pore from the cytoplasmic side, the internal entry of the pore should be at least 11 å wide, assuming
the dimension of  xxxd2215xxx  bound to the channel
is similar to that measured from the crystal structure. in
fact, the portion of the pore between the internal entrance and the blocker binding site should be as wide.
although the estimated electrical distance of  xxxd2215xxx  block is only 30% across the electrical field after
eliminating the trans-ion effect, the actual physical distance  xxxd2215xxx  travels into the pore is perhaps
much larger because this predicted wide tunnel presents a low-resistance (i.e., smaller voltage drop) pathway for cl ions as well as for water molecules. a similar
discrepancy between electrical distance and physical
distance has been described for the binding site of quaternary ammonium inhibitors in the pore of k channels (yellen et al., 1991; zhou et al., 2001a). therefore,
instead of a wide internal vestibule for those sizable
blockers to lodge (linsdell and hanrahan, 1996a; zeltwanger et al., 2000), we propose a wide internal entrance followed by an at least equally wide tunnel that
the blocker has to traverse before reaching its binding
site.
on the other hand, the external entrance of the pore
is likely to be narrower since blockers, such as disulphonic stilbenes (dnds and dids), glutamate, gluconate, and isethionate can only block cftr channels
when applied intracellularly but not extracellularly
(gray et al., 1990; tabcharani et al., 1990; gadsby et
al., 1995; linsdell and hanrahan, 1996a,b). some

binding site. second, the binding site for the blockers
likely also binds cl ions because increasing internal
cl concentration results in less block by isethionate
(fig. 11 a). therefore, we conclude that at least two
cl binding sites are present in the cftr pore. if these
two binding sites are physically close to each other, a
potential electrostatic repulsion between the two closely
seated cl ions can expedite cl exit.
channel’s blockers have been used successfully to explore the pore structure of ion channels. while the
crystal structure of cftr channel is not yet available,
blockers remain as powerful tools to study the cftr
pore. an important remaining question is where the
gate of the cftr channel is located along the anionconducting pore. the slow kinetics of  xxxd2215xxx 
binding makes this blocker a good candidate to study
the relationship between gating and blocking to gain
more information about the structure of this intriguing
molecule.
