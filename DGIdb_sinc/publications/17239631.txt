summary

intravenous immune globulin (ivig) suppresses
autoantibody-mediated inflammation by inducing and activating the inhibitory fc receptor
fcgriib and downstream negative signaling
pathways. we investigated the effects of ivig
on cellular responses to interferon-g (ifn-g), a
potent macrophage activator that exacerbates
inflammation. our study showed that ivig
blocked ifn-g signaling and ifn-g-induced
gene expression and suppressed ifn-g function in vivo during immune responses to listeria
monocytogenes and in an ifn-g-enhanced
model of immune thrombocytopenic purpura.
the mechanism of inhibition of ifn-g signaling
was suppression of expression of the  xxxg1143xxx 
subunit of the ifn-g receptor. the inhibitory
effect of ivig was mediated at least in part by
soluble immune complexes and was dependent
on  xxxg775xxx  but independent of fcgriib. these
results reveal an unexpected inhibitory role for
the activating  xxxg775xxx  in mediating suppression
of ifn-g signaling and suggest that inhibition of
macrophage responses to ifn-g contributes to
the anti-inflammatory properties of ivig.
introduction
intravenous immune globulin (ivig) is an effective therapy
in a variety of autoimmune and chronic inflammatory diseases, such as idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura
(itp), guillain-barré syndrome, myasthenia gravis, and
kawasaki disease (kazatchkine and kaveri, 2001). inves-

tigation of the therapeutic effects of ivig has focused on
suppression of autoantibody- and immune complexmediated pathogenic mechanisms. several possible
mechanisms for the action of ivig have been suggested,
including blockade of cell-surface receptors for igg
(fcgrs) (clynes, 2005), induction of degradation of pathogenic antibodies by displacement from the neonatal fc
receptor (akilesh et al., 2004), inhibition of complement
(basta and dalakas, 1994; basta et al., 2003), immunomodulation by idiotypic antibodies (levy et al., 1998),
and modulation of cytokine production (braun-moscovici
and furst, 2003). ivig increases expression of the inhibitory receptor for igg, fcgriib, and ravetch and colleagues have identified fcgriib as a key mediator of the
suppressive effects of ivig in autoantibody-dependent
murine models of itp and acute arthritis (bruhns et al.,
2003; samuelsson et al., 2001). fcgriib suppresses the
function of activating fcgrs such as fcgri, iii, and iv.
however, the component of ivig that activates fcgriib
expression and function and pathways downstream of
fcgriib that mediate suppression of inflammation are
not well understood (crow et al., 2003), although a role
for c5a in regulating fcgriib expression has been demonstrated (shushakova et al., 2002).
ivig contains predominantly monomeric igg and small
amounts of dimeric and polymeric igg and immune complexes (ics) (teeling et al., 2001). many previous studies
that investigated the active component of ivig focused
on monomeric igg and implicated the fc region in mediating fc receptor blockade and the f(ab)’2 region in neutralization of complement-derived anaphylatoxins (basta
et al., 2003). recently, there has been increasing attention
to the role of immune complexes (ics) in mediating the
suppressive action of ivig (clynes, 2005; siragam et al.,
2005). indeed, small soluble ics such as those contained
in ivig effectively ameliorated murine itp and autoantibody-induced arthritis (siragam et al., 2005). this

suppressive effect was dependent on fcgriib, suggesting
that ics contribute to the fcgriib-dependent suppressive
effects of ivig. interestingly, large particulate ics inhibited
itp independently of fcgriib (siragam et al., 2005),
thereby indicating that ics suppress inflammation by
more than one mechanism. a suppressive role for ics
may appear paradoxical, because ics have traditionally
been considered proinflammatory factors and activators
of inflammatory effector mechanisms (ravetch and
bolland, 2001). however, accumulating evidence supports a role for ics in suppressing immune responses
against viruses and intracellular parasites by mechanisms
that include induction of  xxxg1161xxx  (il-10) and suppression of il-12 expression (miles et al., 2005; suhrbier
and la linn, 2003). although it is clear that ics have
both activating and suppressive effects on immunity
in vivo, the mechanisms underlying suppressive effects
are not well understood.
ifn-g is a potent activator of innate immune cells, including macrophages and nk cells. ifn-g promotes
host defense by enhancing phagocytosis, microbial killing, and antigen presentation (stark et al., 1998). however, excessive ifn-g can lead to pathology secondary
to increased effector responses, leading to tissue damage
and autoimmunity (baccala et al., 2005), and therefore the
production of ifn-g and the magnitude of cellular responses to ifn-g are tightly controlled. cellular responses
to ifn-g are limited by several mechanisms that attenuate
ifn-g-induced signal transduction (yasukawa et al.,
2000). ifn-g signals by binding to a heterodimeric cellsurface receptor composed of the  xxxg1142xxx  and  xxxg1143xxx 
subunits, thereby activating the catalytic activity of receptor-associated  xxxg1219xxx  and jak2 protein tyrosine kinases.
this results in jak-dependent phosphorylation of  xxxg1142xxx 
cytoplasmic tyrosine residues and the recruitment and activation of signal transducer and activator of transcription
1 (stat1) that translocates to the nucleus, activates gene
expression, and mediates most of the activating functions
of ifn-g. the importance of limiting ifn-g signaling is
illustrated by the lethal ifn-g-dependent inflammatory
disease that develops in mice deficient in suppressor of
cytokine signaling 1 (socs1), one of several known attenuators of ifn-g signaling (yasukawa et al., 2000).
ifn-g has been shown to exacerbate inflammation in
several models of immune complex-mediated diseases
that are responsive to ivig therapy (balasa et al., 1997;
musaji et al., 2005; sarvetnick et al., 1990). although it is
well established that ivig suppresses the autoantibodymediated component of these diseases (kazatchkine
and kaveri, 2001), we wished to test whether ivig could
also inhibit ifn-g responses and whether inhibition of
ifn-g responses contributed to the therapeutic efficacy
of ivig. our study showed that ivig blocked ifn-g signaling and ifn-g-induced gene expression and suppressed
ifn-g function in vivo during immune responses to listeria
monocytogenes and in an ifn-g-enhanced model of immune thrombocytopenic purpura (itp). the mechanism
of inhibition of ifn-g signaling was suppression of  xxxg1143xxx 
expression. the inhibitory effect of ivig was mediated at

least in part by soluble immune complexes and was
dependent on  xxxg775xxx  but independent of fcgriib. these
results reveal an fcgriib-independent mechanism of
action of ivig that targets the  xxxg1142xxx .

ifn-g signaling is inhibited by ivig
macrophages express cell-surface fcgrs for igg and
have been implicated in mediating the inhibitory action
of ivig (bruhns et al., 2003; ichiyama et al., 2005). in addition, macrophages are potently activated by ifn-g and
play an important role in innate immunity and the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases (baccala et al., 2005;
stark et al., 1998). therefore, we analyzed the effects of
ivig on ifn-g signaling in macrophages. human macrophages were cultured with ivig and stimulated with
ifn-g, and activation of stat1 was measured. as expected, ifn-g induced robust tyrosine phosphorylation
of stat1 (figure 1a). preincubation of macrophages with
ivig for up to 10 hr had minimal effect on ifn-g-induced
stat1 activation, whereas preincubation with ivig for longer periods (16–24 hr) nearly completely inhibited ifn-ginduced stat1 activation (figure 1a). although the time
point when inhibition was first observed (16–24 hr) varied
among blood donors, inhibition of ifn-g signaling was reproducibly observed in more than 30 independent blood
donors with multiple preparations of ivig when macrophages were preincubated with ivig for 24–48 hr
(data not shown). inhibition of ifn-g-induced stat1 tyrosine phosphorylation by ivig was dose dependent:
0.1 mg/ml of ivig had a negligible effect, 0.25–0.5 mg/ml
had a partial inhibitory effect, and nearly complete inhibition was observed with 5 mg/ml of ivig, a concentration
comparable to physiological igg concentrations present
in normal human serum (figure 1b). this requirement for
high, albeit physiological, concentrations of igg suggested that ifn-g signaling was suppressed either by
physiological amounts of monomeric igg or by the trace
amounts of ics present in ivig preparations (approximately 0.5%), and this will be addressed experimentally
below.
to address the functional significance of ivig-mediated
inhibition of ifn-g signaling, we first investigated the
effects of ivig on ifn-g induction of gene expression.
ifn-g-induced mrna expression of cxcl9 (mig),  xxxg559xxx 
( xxxg559xxx ), and irf-1 was suppressed in macrophages that
had been pretreated with ivig (figure 1c), demonstrating
the functional consequences of ivig-mediated suppression of ifn-g signaling. previous studies showed that
ivig suppresses inflammation in murine systems (bruhns
et al., 2003; clynes, 2005; samuelsson et al., 2001), and
we confirmed that ivig suppressed ifn-g signaling in murine peritoneal macrophages (figure 1d). to begin to address whether inhibition of ifn-g signaling may contribute
to the suppressive effects of ivig in autoimmune diseases, we determined the effects of ivig on ifn-g signaling in vivo. treatment of mice with ivig effectively blocked
ifn-g-induced mrna expression of mig,  xxxg559xxx , and irf-1

(a) human macrophages were cultured with or without ivig (5 mg/ml) for the indicated time periods and then stimulated with 10 u/ml of ifn-g for
10 min. whole-cell lysates were subjected to immunoblotting with phospho-stat1, stat1, and stat3 antibodies.
(b) human macrophages were cultured with the indicated concentrations of ivig for 2 days and stimulated with ifn-g for 10 min, and whole-cell
lysates were analyzed by immunoblotting.
(c) human macrophages were cultured with ivig (5 mg/ml) for 2 days and stimulated with ifn-g (10 units/ml) for 3 hr, and mrna was measured with
real-time pcr. mrna expression was normalized relative to the expression of  xxxg861xxx , and results are shown as mean ± sd of triplicate determinants. representative results from three experiments are shown.
(d) whole-cell lysates from mouse peritoneal macrophages were subjected to sds-page and immunoblotted with phospho-stat1, stat1, and
stat3 antibodies.

peritoneal cells were harvested 3 hr later, macrophages were purified by adhesion, and mrna was measured by real-time pcr.

in macrophages in vivo (figure 1e). overall, the results
demonstrate that ivig attenuates macrophage responses
to ifn-g and suggest that ivig-mediated suppression of
ifn-g signaling contributes to the anti-inflammatory properties of ivig.
ivig enhances susceptibility to listeria
monocytogenes infection
to further investigate the physiological significance of the
inhibitory effect of ivig on ifn-g signaling, we tested the
effects of ivig on infection with l. monocytogenes.
l. monocytogenes is a gram-positive intracellular bacterium that primarily infects macrophages and causes sepsis and meningitis in immunocompromised individuals
and severe fetal infections in pregnant women (pamer,
2004). ifn-g plays a key role in controlling l. monocytogenes infections (huang et al., 1993), and we reasoned
that suppression of ifn-g responses by ivig would enhance susceptibility to l. monocytogenes. mice were

infected with 2000 l. monocytogenes organisms, and infectious burden was determined by measuring total bacterial colony-forming units (cfu) in the spleen 3 days after
infection. treatment of c57bl/6 mice with ivig resulted in
splenic bacterial counts that were more than 100-fold
higher than those of mice treated with saline (figure 2a,
p < 0.001, student’s t test). in contrast, treatment of
 xxxg1142xxx -deficient mice with ivig had no effect on splenic
bacterial load (figure 2a). these results suggest that ivig
suppresses the early ifn-g-dependent immune response
against l. monocytogenes. this hypothesis was further
supported by the finding that ivig suppressed the expression of the ifn-g-inducible genes mig and  xxxg559xxx  in splenic
macrophages of mice infected with l. monocytogenes
(figure 2b).

experiments are shown as mean ± sd of bacterial counts from 9 mice (c57bl/6) or 6 mice ( xxxg1142xxx /) per group.

igg (approximately 0.5%). to assess which components
of ivig are capable of suppressing ifn-g signaling, macrophages were cultured with ivig, the same concentrations of fab or fc fragments, and 10- to 100-fold lower
concentrations of ics. neither fab nor fc fragments suppressed ifn-g signaling (figure 3a). in contrast, immune
complexes exerted inhibitory effects on ifn-g signaling
even at concentrations as low as 10 mg/ml (figure 3a),
and also effectively inhibited ifn-g-induced gene activation in vivo (see figure  xxxd3227xxx  in the supplemental data available online). similar to ics, heat-aggregated fc fragments
inhibited ifn-g signaling, but heat-treated fab fragments
did not (figure s1b). inhibition of ifn-g signaling by ics
was dose dependent, with complete inhibition observed
in the range of 10–25 mg/ml depending on the donor (figures 3a and 3b). 10–25 mg/ml of ics inhibited ifn-g signaling comparably to 1 mg/ml of igg (figures 3a and 3b),
which contains on the order of 5 mg/ml of ics. to more directly assess the role of ics contained within ivig in the inhibition of ifn-g signaling, we used ultracentrifugation to
sediment and thereby remove ics from ivig. consistent
with a role for ics, ultracentrifugation resulted in a loss
of ifn-g-inhibiting activity in the upper fractions of the gradient (figure 3c). instead, ifn-g-inhibiting activity was
found at the bottom of the gradient where immune complexes had sedimented (figure 3c). we found that increasing the ag/ab ratio (which results in the formation
of smaller ics) diminished the inhibition of ifn-g signaling
(figure 3d) and that large insoluble ics effectively suppressed ifn-g signaling (data not shown). together with
the ultracentrifugation data, these results suggest that
larger, more extensively crosslinked ics are more effective
at suppressing ifn-g signaling. ics comprised of igg1,
igg2, and igg3 isotypes of igg were able to inhibit ifn-g
signaling (figure s1c). immune complexes bind complement components in vivo and thus we addressed the
role of complement in our system by depleting complement with cobra venom factor. ivig inhibited ifn-g responses in vivo even in the absence of complement
(figure 3e). collectively, the results suggest that ics mediate the inhibitory effect of ivig on ifn-g signaling.

inhibition of ifn-g signaling by ivig is dependent
on  xxxg775xxx 
igg-containing ics bind to and activate cells through
fcgrs. we wished to determine which  xxxg772xxx  mediates inhibition of ifn-g signaling. human macrophages express
a high-affinity fcgri that is capable of binding monomeric
igg at physiological concentrations present in serum and
lower-affinity fcgrii and  xxxg775xxx  that preferentially interact
with ics (ravetch and bolland, 2001). the recently discovered murine fcgriv also likely preferentially interacts with
immune complexes (nimmerjahn et al., 2005). our first approach was to analyze ivig inhibition of ifn-g signaling in
nk cells that express solely  xxxg775xxx  and in b cells that express solely fcgriib. ivig inhibited ifn-g signaling in nk
cells but not b cells (figure 4a), and also inhibited ifn-g
signaling in human dcs that expressed  xxxg775xxx  (figure s2).
this suggested that  xxxg775xxx  mediates inhibition of ifn-g
signaling, and this hypothesis was further supported by
the finding that specific crosslinking of  xxxg775xxx  on human
macrophages by anti- xxxg775xxx  f’(ab)2 was sufficient to suppress ifn-g signaling (figure 4b).  xxxg775xxx  signals via an
associated  xxxg769xxx  adaptor protein, and we used murine
macrophages deficient in  xxxg775xxx  and  xxxg769xxx  to further investigate the dependence of ivig-mediated suppression
of ifn-g signaling on  xxxg775xxx . ivig did not suppress
ifn-g signaling in macrophages deficient in the activating
 xxxg775xxx  (figure 4c). furthermore, ivig did not suppress
ifn-g-induced gene activation in vivo in macrophages
deficient in  xxxg775xxx  or its associated  xxxg769xxx -signaling chain,
and actually there was a trend toward higher ifn-g-activated gene expression in these cells (figure 4d). inhibition
of ifn-g responses by ivig was not dependent on the
 xxxg769xxx  immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif
(itam),  xxxg1895xxx ,  xxxg1894xxx , or ship (figure s3). these results,
taken together, demonstrate that  xxxg775xxx  is necessary and
sufficient for ivig-mediated inhibition of ifn-g responses.
ivig suppression of ifn-g responses and
of ifn-g-enhanced itp is independent of fcgriib

on myeloid cells (bruhns et al., 2003; samuelsson et al.,
2001; siragam et al., 2005). our results suggested that
fcgriib on b cells was not able to inhibit ifn-g signaling
(figure 4a), but we wished to address the role of myeloid
fcgriib in the regulation of ifn-g responses. ivig effectively suppressed ifn-g-induced stat1 activation in
fcgriib-deficient macrophages (figure 5a), as did crosslinking murine  xxxg775xxx  on fcgriib-deficient macrophages
by 2.4g2 f’(ab)2 that recognizes both fcgriib and  xxxg775xxx 
(figure 5b). in addition, ivig suppressed ifn-g-induced
gene expression in vivo in fcgriib-deficient mice (figure 5c), further supporting the hypothesis that ivig can
exert suppressive effects independently of fcgriib.
these results led us to test whether ivig would inhibit
an ifn-g-mediated inflammatory process in vivo independently of fcgriib, and we used ifn-g-enhanced itp
(figure s4; musaji et al., 2005) as a model system.
fcgriib-deficient mice were pretreated with ivig for
2 days, and then ifn-g-enhanced itp was induced by

administration of ifn-g and  xxxg1202xxx  antibodies directed
against platelets. ivig partially suppressed the drop in
platelet counts in fcgriib-deficient mice in which enhanced itp had been induced by ifn-g and  xxxg1202xxx  antibodies (figure 5d; p < 0.001, student’s t test). of note,
the protocol used differs from the previously described
treatment of itp by ivig, where ifn-g was not used and
ivig was injected immediately prior to administration of
platelet antibodies, and thus these results can not be
directly compared with previous work in this area
(samuelsson et al., 2001; siragam et al., 2005). however,
our results provide additional evidence for fcgriib-independent suppressive effects of ivig in vivo in a system
where ifn-g contributes to the inflammatory process.
the dependence of ivig suppression of ifn-g-enhanced
itp on  xxxg775xxx  could not be directly tested because itp
is not induced in  xxxg775xxx -deficient mice by the available
igg1  xxxg1202xxx  antibodies (samuelsson et al., 2001; teeling
et al., 2001).

ivig downregulates  xxxg1143xxx  expression
multiple mechanisms that negatively regulate ifn-g
signaling have been described, but typically are either
constitutively active or are rapidly induced and transient
(ivashkiv and hu, 2004). in contrast, several hours of preincubation with ivig were required to inhibit ifn-g signaling, and inhibition was sustained for at least 2 days (figure 1a and data not shown). this suggested that ivig
either induced expression of a signaling inhibitor with
delayed kinetics or suppressed expression of an ifn-gsignaling component whose expression decayed slowly
over time. we tested the effects of ivig on the expression
of the ifn-g receptor that consists of a ligand-binding
 xxxg1142xxx  chain and an  xxxg1143xxx -signaling subunit (stark
et al., 1998). surface  xxxg1142xxx  expression was measured
by flow cytometry. ivig had no effect on cell-surface expression of  xxxg1142xxx , but strongly suppressed expression
of  xxxg1143xxx  (figure 6a). to confirm flow cytometry results,
cell-surface proteins were biotinylated and precipitated
with avidin beads, and cell-surface expression of  xxxg1142xxx 
subunits was analyzed by immunoblotting. ivig suppressed cell-surface expression of  xxxg1143xxx , but not
 xxxg1142xxx  (figure 6b). interestingly,  xxxg1143xxx  expression
was lower in whole-cell lysates of ivig-treated relative to
control macrophages, suggesting that diminished expression of  xxxg1143xxx  explained the decreased amounts of
 xxxg1143xxx  detected on the cell surface. finally,  xxxg1143xxx 
was detected in jak2 immunoprecipitates in control, but
not in ivig-treated, macrophages (figure 6c). these

results suggested that decreased  xxxg1143xxx  expression
explained diminished ifn-g signaling in ivig-treated
macrophages, but it remained possible that ivig induced
additional inhibitory mechanisms. to test whether low
 xxxg1143xxx  expression was rate limiting for ifn-g signaling
in ivig-treated macrophages, we used transfection to
restore  xxxg1143xxx  expression in ivig-treated primary macrophages. forced expression of  xxxg1143xxx  in ivig-treated
macrophages reversed the inhibitory effect of ivig on
ifn-g signaling (figure 6d). amounts of  xxxg1143xxx  expression in reconstituted cells were comparable to physiologic amounts (1- to 1.5-fold, data not shown), and thus
this reconstitution experiment showed that downregulation of  xxxg1143xxx  expression was the major mechanism
by which ivig suppressed ifn-g signaling. additional
mechanisms by which ivig could attenuate ifn-g signaling include induction of socs1 (yasukawa et al., 2000)
and activation of stat3 (stark et al., 1998). however,
ivig and ics did not induce socs1 expression and did
not activate tyrosine phosphorylation of stat3 (figures
 xxxg1865xxx  and s5b). socs3 expression was modestly induced
by ivig (figure  xxxg1865xxx ). recent reports demonstrating a
minimal if any role for socs3 in the regulation of ifn-g
signaling (johnston and o’shea, 2003) suggest that induction of low amounts of socs3 by ivig did not play
a marked role in the inhibition of ifn-g signaling in our
system. in addition, we found that ivig-induced autocrine
factors were not sufficient to inhibit ifn-g responses
(figure s5c).

(d)  xxxg773xxx / mice on the c57/bl6 genetic background were injected daily with ivig (2 g/kg; filled squares) or pbs (filled triangles). after the second
ivig injection, mice were given isotype control igg1 or anti- xxxg1202xxx  (2 mg/mouse) and ifn-g (105 units/mouse). representative results from two experiments (p < 0.0001 by student’s t test) are shown.

regulation of pu.1 and ets proteins by ivig
to further investigate the mechanism by which ivig suppressed  xxxg1143xxx  expression, we analyzed the effects of
ivig on  xxxg1143xxx  mrna expression.  xxxg1143xxx  mrna expression was downregulated by ivig treatment of macrophages and nk cells (figure 7a), suggesting that ivig regulates  xxxg1143xxx  transcription or mrna stability. a similar
effect of downregulation of  xxxg1143xxx  mrna expression
was observed when  xxxg775xxx  was specifically crosslinked
on human macrophages (figure 7b).  xxxg775xxx  crosslinking
induced the expression of several genes previously shown
to be induced by  xxxg769xxx -coupled receptors (figure s6a;
qin et al., 2004), and preliminary microarray studies suggested that ivig induces expression of more than 100
genes and suppresses expression a smaller number of
genes (k.-h.p.-m., unpublished observations).
the  xxxg1143xxx  promoter contains a pu.1 binding site
(rhee et al., 1996), and pu.1 has been previously shown
to be regulated by ics and to either activate or repress
gene expression, depending on promoter context
(kihara-negishi et al., 2001). to test the role of pu.1 in regulating  xxxg1143xxx  mrna expression, we used rnai to knock
down pu.1 expression. decreased pu.1 expression resulted in modest but significant increased expression of
 xxxg1143xxx  in human macrophages (figure 7c; p = 0.026,

student’s t test). the role of pu.1 in the regulation of the
 xxxg1143xxx  promoter was further analyzed by cotransfection
experiments. forced expression of pu.1 suppressed
 xxxg1143xxx  promoter activity in a dose-dependent manner,
whereas expression of a dominant-negative pu.1 mutant
resulted in increased  xxxg1143xxx  promoter activity (figure 7d). collectively, these results suggest that pu.1 negatively regulates  xxxg1143xxx  expression by suppressing
 xxxg1143xxx  promoter activity and predict that knockdown of
pu.1 expression would attenuate the suppressive effects
of ivig on ifn-g responses. we were unable to use the
rnai approach to address this question because control
short interfering rnas affected ivig responses. instead,
we nucleofected primary macrophages with pu.1 decoy
oligonucleotides (odn) that block the binding of pu.1
and related ets family members to promoter sequences
in their target genes. sequestration and suppression of
dna binding of pu.1 in the absence of changes in pu.1
expression models the regulation of pu.1 by ivig (described below and depicted in figure s7). pu.1 decoy
odn, but not control scrambled odn (or ap-1 decoy
odn, not shown) reversed the inhibitory effect of ivig on
 xxxg1143xxx  mrna expression and on the activation of stat1
(figure 7e). thus, pu.1 (or related ets proteins) mediate
the inhibitory effect of ivig on ifn-g responses. ivig

and ics regulated pu.1 dna binding activity and expression of additional pu.1 target genes with kinetics that paralleled those of  xxxg775xxx  expression and  xxxg1143xxx  downregulation (figures s7 and s8). taken together, the results
suggest that induction of pu.1-containing protein complexes by ivig mediated inhibition of  xxxg1143xxx  expression.
discussion
in this report, we show that ivig inhibited ifn-g signaling
in macrophages by a mechanism that involves suppression of  xxxg1143xxx  expression, thereby rendering cells unresponsive to ifn-g stimulation. inhibition is mediated by
immune complexes that are contained in ivig and is
dependent on  xxxg775xxx , a well-established activating receptor. our results identify a negative role for immune
complexes and  xxxg775xxx  in regulating ifn-g-mediated inflammation and suggest that inhibition of ifn-g signaling
contributes to the therapeutic efficacy of ivig.
ivig is an effective therapeutic agent in a variety of autoimmune diseases that are dependent on autoantibodies
(itp, myasthenia gravis, experimental acute arthritis) or in
which autoantibodies do not have a clear pathogenic role
(dermatomyositis, kawasaki disease). mechanisms of
ivig action have been most thoroughly investigated in autoantibody-mediated diseases based on initial hypotheses that monomeric igg contained within ivig would
block  xxxg772xxx  function. previous studies have clearly established a role for the inhibitory fcgriib in mediating suppressive effects of ivig in acute autoantibody-dependent
diseases where ifn-g is not known to play a significant
74 immunity 26, 67–78, january 2007 ª2007 elsevier inc.

role (bruhns et al., 2003; samuelsson et al., 2001). however, autoantibody-dependent diseases can be potentiated by ifn-g (baccala et al., 2005; balasa et al., 1997;
musaji et al., 2005), and ifn-g has been implicated in
the pathogenesis of diseases such as dermatomyositis
and kawasaki disease that are responsive to ivig therapy.
indeed, stat1 and ifn-g-inducible genes are expressed at
elevated amounts in dermatomyositis and kawasaki disease patients (abe et al., 2005; greenberg et al., 2002;
illa et al., 1997), and their expression is suppressed by
ivig therapy of kawasaki disease (abe et al., 2005). our
results showing that ivig blocks ifn-g responses, innate
immunity to l. monocytogenes, and ifn-g-enhanced itp
suggest that inhibition of ifn-g responses contributes to
the therapeutic effects of ivig in chronic autoimmune diseases in which ifn-g plays a pathogenic role.
immune complexes can drive inflammatory responses
by activating the complement cascade and fcgrs, and
immune complexes have been implicated in disease pathogenesis (ravetch and bolland, 2001). ics also have a
regulatory role and have been implicated in feedback inhibition of b cell antibody production, suppression of ifn-ginduced hla-dr expression (esparza et al., 1983; virgin
et al., 1985), and suppression of immune responses to
pathogens by mechanisms that include inhibition of
il-12 and induction of il-10 production (esparza et al.,
1983; gerber and mosser, 2001; miles et al., 2005;
suhrbier and la linn, 2003; virgin and unanue, 1984).
our results reveal that inhibition of proximal ifn-g signal
transduction that results in unresponsiveness of macrophages to ifn-g corresponds to another mechanism by

(a) human macrophages and nk cells were cultured with or without ivig for 2 days, and mrna expression of  xxxg1143xxx  was measured by qpcr.
representative data from 9 donors (macrophages) and 2 donors (nk cells) are shown.
(b) human macrophages were cultured for 24 hr with anti- xxxg775xxx  f(ab’)2 (20 mg/ml), and mrna was measured by real-time pcr.
(c) pu.1 gene expression in human macrophages was knocked down with pu.1 rnai. mrna expression of pu.1 and  xxxg1143xxx  was measured by
qpcr at 24 hr and 72 hr after transfection, respectively. data are presented as mean ± sd from three independent donors (*p = 0.026 by student’s
t test).
(d) hela cells were cotransfected with an  xxxg1143xxx  promoter-luciferase reporter plasmid and either control empty plasmids or plasmids encoding
pu.1 or a pu.1 dominant-negative (dn) mutant. cells were harvested 1 day after transfection, and promoter activity was normalized relative to
b-gal activity encoded by a cotransfected internal control plasmid.
(e) human macrophages were nucleofected with scrambled control odns (top) and pu.1 decoy odns (bottom) and treated with ivig starting 4 hr
after nucleofection.  xxxg1143xxx  levels were measured by qpcr (left) after 24 hr of ivig treatment (black bars) or control treatment (white bars). cells were
stimulated with ifn-g after 24 hr of ivig treatment and cell lysates were analyzed by immunoblotting (right). data are representative of three independent experiments.

which ics regulate immune responses. downregulation
of ifn-g responses in our system was not dependent on
il-10 production (k.-h.p.-m., unpublished data), which
is consistent with the efficacy of ivig in kawasaki disease
patients even in the absence of induction of il-10 expression (abe et al., 2005).
the molecular mechanism of suppression of ifn-g
responses by ivig is  xxxg775xxx -induced extinction of the expression of  xxxg1143xxx . induction of cellular nonresponsive-

ness to cytokines by ligand-mediated internalization of
ligand binding subunits of receptors is a well-established
paradigm (bernabei et al., 2001). in macrophages, ifn-g
does not suppress  xxxg1143xxx  expression (yasukawa et al.,
2000). instead, refractoriness of macrophages to ifn-g
is induced in trans by ics and  xxxg775xxx  by suppressing
 xxxg1143xxx  expression. our results support a model in which
ics induce pu.1-mediated suppression of the  xxxg1143xxx 
promoter. the delayed inhibitory response that was

immunity
inhibition of ifn-g responses by ivig and  xxxg775xxx 

observed would preserve macrophage activation by
ifn-g during the early phases of immune responses. delayed inhibition of ifn-g responses may be explained by
delayed kinetics of upregulation of  xxxg775xxx  or a requirement for the induction of autocrine factors by ivig. it is
possible that ivig or autocrine-acting factors regulate the
phosphorylation of pu.1 and thus its interactions with
dna and other proteins, regulate the expression of proteins that interact with pu.1 (oikawa and yamada,
2003), or regulate the expression and/or function of other
ets proteins that can interact with the  xxxg1143xxx  promoter.
interestingly, the ets family member tel2 also downregulates  xxxg1143xxx  expression (carella et al., 2006), suggesting
that  xxxg1143xxx  expression may be regulated by interactions
among ets proteins and that the relative roles of pu.1
and other ets family members may depend on cellular
context and expression patterns.
an established paradigm is that the inhibitory functions
of fcgrs are mediated by fcgriib, which contains a cytoplasmic immune tyrosine-based inhibitory motif (itim) that
recruits phosphatases that suppress signal transduction
(ravetch and lanier, 2000). in contrast,  xxxg775xxx  is well
established as an activating receptor that is required for
multiple antibody/ic-dependent inflammatory responses
in vitro and in vivo (ravetch and bolland, 2001). our results
show that inhibition of ifn-g responses by ics is independent of fcgriib. instead, the results reveal an unexpected
inhibitory role for  xxxg775xxx  in mediating suppression of
ifn-g signaling that leads to decreased ifn-g responses
in vitro and in vivo. there are precedents for fcgriibindependent inhibitory actions of ivig in models of itp
(siragam et al., 2005) and in kawasaki disease where
ivig does not increase fcgriib expression (ichiyama
et al., 2005), but mechanisms underlying fcgriib-independent suppression are not well established. while this
manuscript was under revision,  xxxg769xxx -mediated suppression of itp was reported by a mechanism of ivig-induced
alteration of dc function (siragam et al., 2006). it is possible that the suppression of ifn-g responses in dcs that
we observed may contribute to the ivig effects on dc
phenotype described by siragam et al. we suggest that
inhibition of ifn-g signaling contributes to the efficacy of
ivig in settings where  xxxg775xxx  plays an inhibitory role.
we propose that fcgriib- and  xxxg775xxx -dependent mechanisms of suppression of inflammation are complementary.
fcgriib-dependent mechanisms will dominate in autoantibody-dependent diseases where ifn-g is not an important component of inflammation (samuelsson et al., 2001;
siragam et al., 2005), and  xxxg775xxx -dependent pathways
will come into play in more complex inflammatory settings
that involve ifn-g. these mechanisms target distinct major inflammatory signaling pathways—inhibition of tyrosine
kinase-mediated pathways downstream of fcgrs and
inhibition of jak-stat signaling—and thus can work together to more effectively suppress inflammation.
receptors that signal via the itam-containing adaptors
 xxxg769xxx  and dap12 are generally considered to serve
predominantly activating and inflammatory functions
(hamerman and lanier, 2006). however, recent studies
76 immunity 26, 67–78, january 2007 ª2007 elsevier inc.

have proposed that dap12-coupled receptors and the
 xxxg769xxx -coupled fcari (receptor for iga) can generate suppressive signals (hamerman et al., 2005; pasquier et al.,
2005), likely by recruitment of phosphatases by the itam
motif (hamerman and lanier, 2006). our results suggest
that  xxxg775xxx  generates an alternative inhibitory signal that
is independent of  xxxg769xxx  itam motif or the phosphatases
 xxxg1895xxx ,  xxxg1894xxx , or ship. this inhibitory signal achieves its
negative function by cross-inhibiting macrophage activation by ifn-g, instead of attenuating  xxxg772xxx  signaling. this
inhibitory signal may be generated via other cell-surface
molecules with which  xxxg775xxx  associates (mina-osorio
and ortega, 2004) that do not utilize itam-dependent signaling pathways. these results extend our understanding
of the mechanisms that mediate the bifunctional activating
and inhibitory roles of itam-coupled receptors.
in summary, this study reveals an inhibitory role for
 xxxg775xxx  in macrophage activation that is mediated by extinction of  xxxg1143xxx  expression and induction of unresponsiveness to ifn-g. inhibition of ifn-g signaling mediates
suppressive effects of ics and contributes to the therapeutic anti-inflammatory effects of ivig.
experimental procedures
cell culture, mice, and reagents
peripheral blood mononuclear cells (pbmcs) were obtained from
whole blood from disease-free volunteers by density gradient centrifugation with  xxxd3253xxx  (invitrogen, carlsbad, ca). human nk cells, b cells,
and monocytes were obtained from fresh pbmc with anti-cd56,
 xxxg375xxx , and cd14 magnetic beads (miltenyi biotec, auburn, ca), and
cell purity was verified by flow cytometry as previously described
(hu et al., 2002). human macrophages were derived from cd14+ blood
monocytes by culturing in rpmi 1640 medium (invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fbs (hyclone, logan, ut) and 10 ng/ml of  xxxg524xxx 
(peprotech, rocky hill, nj). murine peritoneal macrophages were purified by adherence to tissue-culture dishes. ivig (gamimmune n) was
from blood diagnostics (tacoma, wa), and purified  xxxd2207xxx  was
from sigma-aldrich (st. louis, mo). immune complexes were made
as described (nagarajan et al., 1995) with modifications. in brief, human
igg was mixed with goat anti- xxxd2207xxx  f(ab’)2 fragments (icl, inc.,
newberg, or) at a molar ratio of 1:2. the mixture was incubated at
4 c overnight, insoluble components were removed by centrifugation,
and the soluble fraction was used for immune complexes. fab and fc
fragments of igg were prepared with immuno pure fab preparation
kit (pierce, rockford, il), according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
heat-aggregated fc fragments were prepared by incubation at 65 c
for 20 min, followed by centrifugation  xxxd1891xxx ,000 rpm for 5 min. cobra
venom factor was obtained from calbiochem (san diego, ca). fcgriiband  xxxg769xxx  chain-deficient mice that had been backcrossed for 12 generations to the c57bl/6 background and genetically matched control
mice were purchased from taconic (germantown, ny).  xxxg775xxx -deficient mice on the c57/bl6 background,  xxxg1895xxx -deficient mice, and genetically matched controls were obtained from jackson laboratory (bar
harbor, me). ship-deficient mice and mice with a myeloid lineagespecific deletion of  xxxg1894xxx  were previously reported (du et al., 2005;
helgason et al., 1998). the experiments with human and murine cells were
approved by, respectively, the hospital for special surgery institutional
review board and institutional animal care and use committee.
real-time quantitative rt-pcr
real-time pcr was performed as previously described (hu et al.,
2002). triplicate reactions were run for each sample, and expression
of a tested gene was normalized relative to amounts of  xxxg861xxx .

infection with l. monocytogenes
l. monocytogenes (wild-type strain 10403s) were grown in brain-heart
infusion (bhi) broth (becton dickinson, sparks, md), and sublethal infection of mice was induced by intravenous injection of 2000 bacteria
per animal as previously described (serbina et al., 2003). 3 days post
infection, mouse spleens were homogenized in pbs containing 0.1%
triton x-100 to extract bacteria, and colony-forming units were
measured by plating serial dilutions of homogenates on bhi plates
overnight at 37 c.
flow cytometry
2 3 105 cells were stained with antibodies against human  xxxg1142xxx ,
 xxxg1143xxx  (pbl, piscataway, nj), or isotype-matched control antibodies
(bd pharmingen, san diego, ca). samples were analyzed on a
facscan (bd, san diego, ca), and data were analyzed with cellquest
software.
immunoblotting
whole-cell extracts and nuclear extracts were obtained, and protein
amounts were quantitated with the bradford assay (biorad, hercules,
ca), as previously described (hu et al., 2002). for immunoblotting,
10 mg of cell lysates were fractionated on 7.5% or 10% polyacrylamide
gels with sds-page, transferred to polyvinylidene fluoride membranes (millipore, billerica, ma), and incubated with specific antibodies, and enhanced chemiluminescence was used for detection.
experimental immune thrombocytopenia
itp was induced by injecting 4- to 8-week-old mice with 2 mg of antiintegrin aiib chain ( xxxg1202xxx ) (clone mwreg30, rat igg1) or control rat
igg1 (bd pharmingen), as previously described (siragam et al.,
2005). mice were treated with ivig and ifn-g as described in figure
legends and then blood was collected into tubes containing 5 ml icecold 1% edta/pbs and further diluted to a final dilution of 1:12,000
in 1% edta/pbs. platelets were counted by facscan with rbc as
an internal reference standard.
transient transfection and luciferase assay
human monocytes were transfected with  xxxg1143xxx  expression plasmids or control empty vector with the monocyte nucleofector kit and
program y-001 (amaxa biosystems, cologne, germany). for pu.1
knockdown experiments, rnai oligos were obtained from ambion
(austin, tx), and the monocyte nucleofector kit was used for transfection. for transfection of human monocytes with decoy oligodeoxynucleotides (odns), complementary single-stranded odns, obtained
from invitrogen, were annealed and used for transfection with the
monocyte nucleofector kit. odn with the following sequences were
used: scrambled decoy odn, 50 -catgtcgtcactgcgctcat-30
and 50 -atgagcgcagtgacgacatg-30 ; pu.1 decoy odn, 5-aagt
catttcctcttagtt-30 and 50 -actaagaggaaatgacttt-30 . hela
cells were transfected in triplicate in 6-well plates with an  xxxg1143xxx  reporter construct and an expression plasmid encoding pu.1, a pu.1
dominant-negative mutant, or a control empty vector (pcb6 or
pece) via polyfectamine (qiagen, valencia, ca). on the next day,
cell lysates were prepared and analyzed for firefly luciferase activity
with the luciferase reporter assay system from promega (madison,
wi). luciferase activity was normalized relative to b-galactosidase
activity encoded by a cotransfected internal control plasmid.
