gastric mucosal cells cultured in 10% fbs-containing medium. rtpcr and northern hybridization demonstrated that h. pylori lps
stimulated expression of nox1 and a novel  xxxg1508xxx  homolog ( xxxg1582xxx )
mrnas with a peak at 4 h, followed by upregulation of superoxide
anion (o⫺
2 ) generation. pretreatment with 10 mg/ml of a nonabsorbable antigastric ulcer drug,  xxxd1960xxx  ( xxxd1960xxx ), completely
blocked these two mrna expressions and the upregulation of o⫺
2
production. under low (0.1%)-fbs conditions, h. pylori lps predominantly caused apoptosis of the cells.  xxxd1960xxx  completely blocked
the lps-triggered phosphorylation of transforming growth factor-␤activated kinase 1 (tak1) and tak1-binding protein 1, activation of
 xxxg342xxx , loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, release of
 xxxg569xxx , activation of  xxxg341xxx , and appearance of apoptotic
cells. in contrast,  xxxd1960xxx  had no effect on ethanol- or etoposideinitiated apoptosis. the  xxxd1960xxx -pretreated cells exhibited the responsiveness to h. pylori lps, similarly as untreated control cells did,
when  xxxd1960xxx  was removed by washing before the addition of h. pylori
lps. incubation of h. pylori lps with  xxxd1960xxx  eliminated the toxic
effects of the lps, and nondenatured polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis indicated the formation of higher molecular mass complexes
between h. pylori lps and  xxxd1960xxx , suggesting that  xxxd1960xxx  may interact
with h. pylori lps and block the activation of  xxxg2290xxx 
(tlr4). our results suggest that  xxxd1960xxx  may suppress tlr4-mediated
inflammation or accelerated apoptosis caused h. pylori infection.

population carries a gramnegative bacterium, helicobacter pylori, that colonizes the
human stomach. h. pylori infection causes persistent inflammation and enhanced th1 immune response in human gastric
mucosa. environmental factors, h. pylori virulence factors,
and host factors that modify the interaction between this
bacterium and host alter the outcome of h. pylori-associated
diseases (31). the most distinguishing feature of h. pylori is
the presence of cag pathogenicity island (cagpai) that carries
a number of pathogenic genes including the caga and the cage
genes (2, 42). the vaca (8, 33) and the baba2 (11) genes also

affect epithelial cell dynamics and inflammatory responses. as
for host genomics, several human gene polymorphisms, including the il-1␤, il-1␤ receptor, and tnf-␣ genes, which result
in an enhanced th1 response, were reported to be associated
with an increased risk of gastric cancer (6, 7, 31).
the chemical structure of h. pylori lps is different from
those of other enterobacterial lpss (5, 9, 25), and its endotoxic
properties are very low compared with other enterobacterial
preparations (4, 26, 30). on the other hand, it was reported that
h. felis caused severe atrophic gastritis in c3h/he mice,
whereas c3h/hej mice with a mutated  xxxg2290xxx 
(tlr4) gene showed heavy colonization but minimal atrophic
gastritis with much less macrophage infiltration (34). subsequently, orally administered h. pylori lps was shown to
trigger inflammatory responses in rat gastric mucosa, characterized by enhanced production of inflammatory mediators and
accelerated apoptosis (32). recently, it has been shown that h.
pylori lps upregulates tlr4 induction in human gastric
epithelial cells (14, 17, 35), and tlr4 is suggested to serve as
a receptor for h. pylori binding (37). those observations
suggest a crucial role of h. pylori lps and tlr4 in mucosal
inflammation caused by h. pylori infection.
enterobacterial lps is a potent activator of the phagocyte
nadph oxidase. recently, six new homologs of gp91phox
expressed in nonphagocytic cells have been identified and
named systematically as the nadph oxidase (nox)/dual oxidase (duox) family (23, 24). subsequently, novel homologs of
 xxxg1508xxx  and  xxxg1509xxx , designated  xxxg1582xxx  ( xxxg1582xxx ) and
nox activator 1 (noxa1), respectively, have been identified to
be crucial adaptor proteins for nox1 (3, 10, 39). with the use
of cdna libraries from guinea pig gastric mucosal cells, we
had cloned the guinea pig homologs of  xxxg1582xxx  (genbank
accession no. af539796), noxa1 cdna (genbank accession
no. ab105907), and nox1 cdnas (genbank accession no.
ab099629). in addition to guinea pig enterochromaffin-like
(20) and chief cells (46), primary cultures of guinea pig gastric
pit cells are sensitive to h. pylori lps (17–19, 40). gastric pit
cells express nox1 and tlr4 as well as  xxxg1350xxx , a molecule
associated with the extracellular domain of tlr4, and markedly upregulated superoxide anion (o⫺
2 ) generation in response
to h. pylori lps (17, 19, 40). nox1-derived reactive oxygen
species (ros), particularly  xxxd2298xxx , stimulated their
proliferation and inflammatory responses through activating
nf-␬b (41). on the other hand, when these cells were maintained in low-serum conditions and exposed to h. pylori lps,
the costs of publication of this article were defrayed in part by the payment
of page charges. the article must therefore be hereby marked “advertisement”

anti-h. pylori actions of  xxxd1960xxx 

the lps dominantly caused apoptosis (18). these diverse
events mediated by tlr4 and nox1 may be relevant to
histopathological features characteristic of chronic atrophic
gastritis: enhanced apoptosis occurs in the superficial compartment of gastric mucosa where the bulk of bacteria is found,
while at the same time, compensatory hyperproliferation is
accompanied in the proliferation zone (45). thus primary
cultures of guinea pig gastric mucosal cells may be an excellent
model to examine the tlr4-mediated epithelial cell responses
to h. pylori infection.
 xxxd1960xxx  ( xxxd1960xxx ) is a dehydroabietic acid derivative
originally purified from pine resin (28) and is now widely used
for the treatment of gastric ulcer and gastritis in japan. this
agent has a high affinity for gastric mucus and is known to
inhibit pepsin (29) and urease activities (15).  xxxd1960xxx  is also
suggested to improve efficacy of antibiotic therapy for h.
pylori infection in patients with peptic ulcer (1, 16). a recent
study showed that  xxxd1960xxx  inhibited transcription of the il-8
gene and secretion of il-8 by gastric epithelial cells infected
with h. pylori at a concentration of 5 mg/ml. however, the
precise pharmacological actions are still unclear. in this study,
we found that  xxxd1960xxx  blocked the h. pylori lps-triggered
activation of nox1 and apoptosis of guinea pig gastric mucosal
cells.
materials and methods

isolation and culture of guinea pig gastric mucosal cells under
lps-free conditions. the care and healing of the animals were in
accordance with the national institutes of health guidelines, and the
present study was approved by the animal care committee of the
university of tokushima. gastric mucosal cells were prepared aseptically from guinea pig fundic glands under lps-free conditions, as
previously described (19). isolated gastric mucosal cells were cultured
for 2 days in rpmi 1640 (gibco, grand island, ny), supplemented
10% fbs (icn biomedicals, aurora, oh), 100 u/ml penicillin, and
100 ␮g/ml streptomycin. all reagents and media were free of detectable amounts of lps, and the final complete culture medium contained ⬍100 pg/ml lps, which was determined by the limulus
ameobocyte lysate assay (19). after being cultured for 2 days, growing cells consisted of pit cells (⬎90%), pre-pit cells (⬃5%), parietal
cells (4 –5%), mucous neck cells (⬍1%), and fibroblasts (⬍1%) (19,
40). pit cells are responsible for o⫺
2 generation (19, 40). the rate of
o⫺
2 production was assayed by measuring the superoxide dismutaseinhibitable reduction of  xxxg569xxx  and was expressed as nanomoles per milligram of protein per hour (40). h. pylori lps was
purified from a clinical isolate, and its endotoxin activity was determined to be 109 endotoxin unit (eu)/␮g by the limulus ameobocyte
lysate assay as previously described (19). lps from escherichia coli
k-235 was purchased from sigma (st. louis, mo), and its endotoxin
activity was also determined to be 344 eu/␮g by the same assay.
assessment of apoptosis. apoptosis was determined by dna fragmentation and chromatin condensation. for detecting dna ladder
formation, both floating and attached cells were collected in microcentrifuge tubes and centrifuged at 900 g for 5 min at 4°c. the pellets
were lysed for 30 min at 4°c in 200 ␮l of 10 mm tris 䡠 hcl buffer (ph
8.0), containing 10 mm edta and 0.5% (vol/vol) triton x-100.
fragmented dnas were extracted and analyzed as described previously (13). for morphological detection of apoptosis, cells were fixed
with 4% formalin in pbs for 30 min, washed twice with pbs, and
stained for 20 min with 5 ␮g/ml of a fluorescent dye hoechst 33342
(sigma). chromosomal condensation was observed using a fluorescence microscopy (tmd 3000-ef; nikon, tokyo, japan). mitochondrial membrane potential was cytochemically determined using a
mitolight apoptosis detection kit (chemicon, temecula, ca) accordajp-gastrointest liver physiol • vol

ing to the manufacturer’s protocol. activities of  xxxg341xxx - and 8-like
enzymes were measured using the synthetic substrates n-acetyl-aspglu-val-asp-p-nitroanilide (ac-devd-pna) and n-acetyl-ile-gluthr-asp-p-nitroanilide (ac-ietd-pna), respectively (13).
immunoblot analysis. whole cell proteins were extracted from
cultured cells as previously described (19). sample of 35-␮g protein
per lane was separated by sds-page and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. after nonspecific binding sites were
blocked with 4% purified casein, the membrane was incubated for 1 h
at room temperature with a 1,000⫻ diluted antibody against transforming growth factor-␤-activated kinase 1 (tak1; santa cruz biotechnology, santa cruz, ca) or tak1-binding protein 1 (tab1;
santa cruz biotechnology). bound antibodies were detected with an
enhanced chemiluminescence western blotting detection kit (amersham pharmacia, piscataway, nj). cytosol and mitochondria fractions
were prepared, and the release of  xxxg569xxx  from mitochondria
was detected by immunoblot analysis with an antibody against  xxxg569xxx  (pharmingen, san diego, ca) (18). bound antibodies were
then removed by rinsing the membrane for 15 min at 50°c in 60 mm
of tris 䡠 hcl buffer (ph 6.8) containing 0.1 mm 2-mercaptethanol and
2% sds. after being washed with pbs, the membrane was again
subjected to immunoblotting with an antibody against ␤-actin (oncogene, cambridge, ma).
rt-pcr and northern blot analysis. total rna was isolated with
an acid guanidinium thiocyanate-phenol-chloroform mixture (40). rt
reaction and pcr were performed using a takara rt-pcr kit
(takara, tokyo, japan). the sequences of primer sets used were as
follows:  xxxg1582xxx , 5⬘-tttgccttctctgtgcgctgg-3⬘(sense) and
5⬘-tctggggtggcaggatcacc-3⬘(antisense); nox1, 5⬘-atgggaaactgggtggttaa-3⬘ (sense) and 5⬘-tagctgaagttaccatgagaa-3⬘a pig  xxxg861xxx , 5⬘-tcatgaccacagtccatgccatcact-3⬘ (sense) and 5⬘-gcctgcttcaccaccttcttgatgt-3⬘(antisense). pcr products were sequenced with a dna
sequencer and confirmed to be the corresponding cdna fragments.
for northern blot analysis, samples of 30 ␮g of total rna were
subjected to electrophoresis in 1% agarose gels containing 0.6 m
formaldehyde and transferred to nylon membrane filters (hybond-nplus; amersham pharmacia). after prehybridization, the membrane
was hybridized for 4 h at 65°c with a cdna probe for  xxxg1582xxx , nox1,
or  xxxg861xxx , which had been prelabeled with [␣-32p] xxxd1836xxx 
triphosphate using a random primer kit (takara). the membrane was
washed twice with 2⫻ standard saline citrate (ssc; 0.3 m nacl ⫹
0.03 m sodium citrate) containing 0.5% sds for 10 min at 65°c and
then three times with 0.2⫻ ssc containing 1% sds. bound probes
were autoradiographed by exposure to a kodak x-omat film for an
appropriate time at ⫺80°c.
statistical analysis. anova and scheffé’s test were used to
determine statistically significant differences. differences were considered significant if p ⬍0.01.

anti-h. pylori actions of  xxxd1960xxx 

fig. 1. effects of  xxxd1960xxx  on helicobacter pylori lps-triggered upregulation of
o⫺
2 production from guinea pig gastric mucosal cells. guinea pig gastric
mucosal cells were cultured for 2 days in rpmi 1640 medium supplemented
with 10% fbs under lps-free conditions (19). the cells were pretreated with
the indicated concentrations of  xxxd1960xxx  dissolved in lps-free saline (otsuka
pharmaceutical, tokushima, japan) or the saline (shown as “0 mg/ml  xxxd1960xxx ”)
for 30 min and then exposed to 20 eu/ml (183 ng/ml) of h. pylori lps (f) or
3.44 eu (10 ng)/ml of escherichia coli lps (œ) for 12 h. the rate of o⫺

expressed as nmol 䡠 mg protein⫺1 䡠 h⫺1 (40). the rate of o⫺

or saline (䊐). values are means ⫾ sd, n ⫽ 6. *significantly decreased,

mg/ml  xxxd1960xxx , respectively, and 10 mg/ml of this compound
completely blocked the upregulation of o⫺
2 production stimulated by h. pylori or e. coli lps (fig. 1).
although extremely high concentrations of  xxxd1960xxx  were
required for the inhibition, the effective concentrations were
similar to those reported in experiments in vitro (12, 21). we
also confirmed that treatment with  xxxd1960xxx  at 20 mg/ml did not
change the cell viability throughout the experiments. this was
based on continued trypan blue exclusion, adherence to the
culture plates, and unchanged morphological features (data not
shown). untreated and h. pylori lps (20 eu/ml)-treated cells
released 3.03 ⫾ 0.68 (means ⫾ sd, n ⫽ 4) and 5.93 ⫾ 0.74%
(n ⫽ 4) of the total cellular lactate dehydrogenase activity
during 12-h incubation, respectively. cells treated with 20
mg/ml  xxxd1960xxx  or with 20 mg/ml  xxxd1960xxx  plus 20 eu/ml h. pylori
lps, respectively, released 2.66 ⫾ 0.71 (n ⫽ 4) or 2.42 ⫾
0.36% (n ⫽ 4) of the activity during the same period. thus the
concentrations used in this study were not toxic and may be
clinically relevant, because patients are usually taking  xxxd1960xxx  1
(1) or 2 g twice a day (16).
effects of  xxxd1960xxx  on h. pylori lps-induced expression of
nox1 and  xxxg1582xxx  mrnas. primary cultures of guinea pig
gastric mucosal cells are more sensitive to e. coli lps than h.
pylori lps. however, h. pylori lps is important for the
pathogenesis of gastric disorders. we next examined the mechanism by which  xxxd1960xxx  blocked the priming effect of h. pylori
lps. rt-pct and northern hybridization showed that on
stimulation by 20 eu/ml of h. pylori lps, guinea pig gastric
mucosal cells expressed nox1 and  xxxg1582xxx  mrnas (fig. 2),
followed by upregulation of o⫺
2 generation (fig. 1). pretreatment with 10 mg/ml  xxxd1960xxx  inhibited the lps-induced expression of these two mrnas, which was confirmed by rt-pcr
(fig. 2a) and northern blot analysis (fig. 2b). these results
suggest that  xxxd1960xxx  may block the priming effect by inbibiting
the lps-induced transcriptional activation of the nox1 and the
 xxxg1582xxx  genes.
ajp-gastrointest liver physiol • vol

guinea pig gastric mucosal cells constitutively express
mrnas for  xxxg1509xxx , its new homolog noxa1, p22phox, and
rac1, whereas the levels of these mrna were not changed
after exposure to h. pylori lps (data not shown). the finding
is inconsistent with our previous report that in guinea pig
gastric mucosal cells, the amount of a 67-kda protein that
cross-reacted with an antibody against human  xxxg1509xxx  increased in parallel with elevation of o⫺
2 generation after
treatment with h. pylori lps (19). to explore this inconsistency, we developed a novel polyclonal antibody against human recombinant  xxxg1509xxx , which recognized the guinea pig
 xxxg1509xxx  with a molecular mass of 63 kda, and the amount was
not affected by h. pylori lps (data not shown).
effects of  xxxd1960xxx  on h. pylori lps-induced apoptosis.
higher concentrations of h. pylori lps (⬎200 eu/ml) caused
apoptosis of primary cultured guinea pig gastric mucosal cells
in 10% fbs-containing media. h. pylori lps more effectively
induced apoptosis of the cells in a low (0.1%) fbs-containing
rpmi 1640 medium at 2 eu/ml (18.3 ng/ml) or higher concentrations (18). lipid a mediated this apoptosis (18). we also
tested whether  xxxd1960xxx  could inhibit the apoptosis. treatment
with 10 mg/ml  xxxd1960xxx  alone did not initiate apoptosis of the
cells (fig. 3a). pretreatment with 5 or 10 mg/ml of  xxxd1960xxx  for
30 min significantly suppressed the apoptosis induced with 40
eu/ml (366 ng/ml) of h. pylori lps, which was estimated by
counting the number of cells having condensed and fragmented
chromatin (fig. 3, a and b). the pretreatment with  xxxd1960xxx  also
inhibited the apoptotic dna ladder formation in a dosedependent manner (fig. 3c).
lps initially activates  xxxg342xxx , stimulates of mitochondria-dependent apoptotic processes, and finally activates effecter  xxxg341xxx  in guinea pig gastric mucosal cells (18). as
shown in fig. 4a, after treatment of cells with 40 eu/ml of h.
pylori lps,  xxxg342xxx -like enzyme activity started to increase
within 4 h (fig. 4a). in association with this activation, the
cells began to release  xxxg569xxx  from mitochondria into the
cytoplasm at this time point (fig. 5a), followed by a significant
elevation of  xxxg341xxx -like enzyme activity at 8 h (fig. 4b).
 xxxd1960xxx  alone  xxxd1891xxx  mg/ml did not modify  xxxg342xxx - and 3-like
enzyme activities during the experimental period, whereas it
completely suppressed the lps-triggered increases in caspase
8- and 3-like enzyme activities (fig. 4). at the same time,
 xxxd1960xxx  suppressed both lps-induced release of  xxxg569xxx 

fig. 2. expression of nadph oxidase 1 (nox1) and  xxxg1582xxx  ( xxxg1582xxx )
mrnas. after guinea pig gastric mucosal cells were pretreated with saline
(vehicle) or 10 mg/ml  xxxd1960xxx  dissolved in saline for 30 min in 10% fbscontaining rpmi 1640 medium, they were exposed to h. pylori lps (20
eu/ml) for the indicated times. expression of nox1,  xxxg1582xxx , and  xxxg861xxx 
mrnas was measured by rt-pcr (a) and northern hybridization (b), as
described in materials and methods.

gastric mucosal cells pretreated with saline or  xxxd1960xxx  were exposed to h.
pylori lps (40 eu/ml) for the indicated times in 0.1% fbs-containing rpmi
1640 medium. mitochondria-free cytosolic extracts (cytosol) and mitochondrial pellets (mitochondria) were prepared from these cells (18), and the
amounts of  xxxg569xxx  in these fractions were measured by immunoblot
analysis using a 12% polyacrylamide gel, as described in materials and
methods (a). mitochondrial membrane potential was monitored using a
mitolight kit (b). mitochondria having intact membrane potentials are colored

(fig. 5b).
effects of  xxxd1960xxx  on ethanol- and etoposide-induced apoptosis. we also examined whether  xxxd1960xxx  similarly inhibited
apoptosis caused by other agents. ethanol activates an initiator
caspase,  xxxg342xxx , and stimulates mitochondria-mediated apoptosis (43).  xxxd1960xxx  failed to block the activation of  xxxg342xxx 
(fig. 6a)- and 3-like enzyme (fig. 6b) activities and apoptosis
(fig. 6c) of the cells exposed to 5% ethanol for 12 h. a
phyllotoxin analog, etoposide, induces dna double-strand
breaks and apoptosis. treatment of the cells with this agent for
12 h activated  xxxg341xxx  (fig. 6b) and caused apoptosis (fig.
6c) without affecting  xxxg342xxx -like enzyme activity (fig. 6a).
 xxxd1960xxx  again failed to suppress this apoptosis stimulated by the
genotoxic agent.
effects of  xxxd1960xxx  on stimulation of tlr4 by h. pylori lps.
tak1 is one of the common signal-transduction molecules for
tlr4 and il-1 receptor-signaling pathways, and tab1 functions as an activator for the tak1. as previously described
(18), treatment with 40 eu/ml of h. pylori lps phosphorylated
tak1 and tab1 within 30 min (fig. 7, a and b, lanes 1– 6).
pretreatment of  xxxd1960xxx  completely blocked the lps-triggered
phosphorylation of these molecules (lanes 7–12 in fig. 7, a
and b). thus  xxxd1960xxx  was likely to interfere the activation of
tlr4 signaling by h. pylori lps.

mined by the limulus ameobocyte lysate assay. the acidification itself decreased to the activity from 40 to 14 eu/ml,
probably due to the removal of phosphates from lipid a (19).
acid-precipitated  xxxd1960xxx  absorbed h. pylori lps, and the
resultant supernatant contained only ⬍0.4 eu/ml of the lps.
to further confirm the interaction between h. pylori lps
and  xxxd1960xxx , 366 ng/ml h. pylori lps was incubated with
different concentrations of  xxxd1960xxx  in rpmi 1640 medium for
30 min at 37°c, and the mixture was subjected to nondenatured
gel electrophoresis using a 5% polyacrylamide gel. changes in
molecular mass of h. pylori lps was indirectly assessed by the
silver staining. as shown in fig. 9a, incubation of h. pylori
lps with 2 mg/ml or higher concentrations of  xxxd1960xxx  produced
slower migration of h. pylori lps. we also examined the
interaction between e. coli lps and  xxxd1960xxx . in this case, a
higher concentration of e. coli lps (71 ␮g/ml) was incubated
with 10 mg/ml  xxxd1960xxx  to visualize e. coli lps by the silver
staining. the nondenatured gel electrophoresis showed more
slowly migrated bands of e. coli lps after incubation with
 xxxd1960xxx  (fig. 9b).

induced activation of nox1 (fig. 8a; d) and apoptosis (d in fig.
8, b or c). a simultaneous addition of  xxxd1960xxx  and h. pylori
lps partially inhibited the lps effects (fig. 8, a–c, e),
whereas h. pylori lps lost its stimulatory actions when preincubated with  xxxd1960xxx  for 30 min before an addition (fig. 8,
a–c; f). pretreatment with  xxxd1960xxx  appeared not to modify the
responsiveness of the cells to h. pylori lps, because ecabetpretreated cells similarly upregulated o⫺
2 generation or underwent apoptosis in response to h. pylori lps, when  xxxd1960xxx  was
removed by washing before stimulation by h. pylori lps (fig.
8, a–c; g). these data suggest that this compound may
preferentially interact with h. pylori lps and inhibit h. pylori
lps-stimulated tlr4 signaling.
on the basis of the above findings, we tested whether  xxxd1960xxx 
directly bound to h. pylori lps.  xxxd1960xxx  precipitates under
acidic conditions. after preincubation of 40 eu (366 ng)/ml of
h. pylori lps with 10 mg/ml  xxxd1960xxx  or saline for 30 min at
37°c, these mixtures were left untreated or acidified to ph 1.2
with hydrochloric acid and subjected to centrifugation at
15,000 g for 20 min at 4°c. endotoxin activities of these
supernatants neutralized with sodium hydroxide were deterajp-gastrointest liver physiol • vol

because endotoxic activity of h. pylori lps is much lower
than lps from the other enterobacteria (4, 26, 30), h. pylori
lps is not generally considered as a crucial virulence. on the
other hand, guinea pig gastric pit cells, chief cells (46), and
enterochromaffin-like cells (20) are highly responsive to h.
pylori lps. furthermore, an oral administration of h. pylori
lps can trigger distinct inflammatory responses in rat gastric
mucosa (32). lps is a complex molecule composed of carbohydrate and lipid fragments. it has recently been shown that a
chemically synthesized lipid a of h. pylori as well as its
natural lipid a are able to activate tlr4 signaling and trigger
a weaker but significant proinflammatory response in human
gastric epithelium (mkn-1 cells), although they exert no or

formation in gastric mucosal cells. gastric mucosal cells maintained in 10%

follows: these cells were left untreated (a) or exposed to 20 or 40 eu/ml of h.

to 20 or 40 eu/ml of h. pylori lps (c), stimulated by 20 or 40 eu/ml of h.
pylori lps, and then treated with 10 mg/ml  xxxd1960xxx  (d), or simultaneously
exposed to 20 or 40 eu/ml of h. pylori lps and 10 mg/ml  xxxd1960xxx  (e). h. pylori
lps (20 or 40 eu/ml) were incubated with 10 mg/ml  xxxd1960xxx  for 30 min at
37°c, and these mixtures were added to the cells maintained in 10% or 0.1%

very low endotoxic activities and mitogenic properties on
immune cells (27).
recently, the tlr family expressed by gastric epithelium
has been suggested to play an essential role in the mucosal
immunity to h. pylori (14, 35, 36). with the use of hek293
cells transfected with tlr2, tlr4, and  xxxg1350xxx  or tlr5 expression plasmid, smith et al. (36) suggested that tlr2 and
tlr5 but not tlr4 are required for h. pylori-induced nf-␬b
activation and chemokine expression. on the other hand, ishihara et al. (14) have shown that h. pylori infection upregulates
the tlr4 and  xxxg1350xxx  expression in human gastric mucosa and
have suggested that the tlr4/ xxxg1350xxx  system is a potent receptor complex involved in the response to h. pylori lps in
ajp-gastrointest liver physiol • vol

gastric epithelium. a majority of guinea pig gastric mucosal
cells used in this study consisted of pit cells (⬎95%), and
fibroblasts were ⬍1%. these cultures constitutively express
tlr4 and  xxxg1350xxx  but not tlr2 or  xxxg2293xxx  (17, 19), and tlr4
mrna and protein were easily detectable by northern blot
analysis and immunoblotting, respectively (17). furthermore,
immunohistochemistry showed that gastric pit cells possessed
significant amounts of tlr4 protein preferentially on the
plasma membrane (17), similarly as reported by ishihara et al.
(14) and schmausser et al. (35). thus tlr4 expressed in
gastric pit cells is likely to play an essential role in the
responses to lps from h. pylori as well as e. coli. however,
it is still unknown whether h. pylori lps actually stimulates
human gastric epithelial cells in vivo.
first, we examined the mechanism for the activation of
nox1. nox1 was thought to generate o⫺
2 without any cytosolic
components of phagocyte nadph oxidase, such as  xxxg1508xxx  or
 xxxg1509xxx  (38). but recently, it has been shown that  xxxg1582xxx  plus
either  xxxg1509xxx  or its homolog noxa1 are necessary for o⫺
2producing activity of nox1 (3, 10, 39). h. pylori lps did not
change the levels of  xxxg1509xxx  and its homolog (noxa1) mrnas
(unpublished observations), but it stimulated the expression of
 xxxg1582xxx  mrna in association with upregulation of nox1
mrna expression and o⫺
2 generation.  xxxg1582xxx  conserves most
of functional domains for protein-protein interactions (39),
whereas it lacks the autoinhibitory region of  xxxg1508xxx  (3, 10,
39). human and mouse  xxxg1582xxx  proteins may directly bind via
its sh3 domains to the cooh terminus of p22phox without any
conformational changes (39). predicted amino acid sequence
of guinea pig  xxxg1582xxx  (genbank accession number ab105906)
suggests that this component may interact with  xxxg1509xxx , p51nox,
or p22phox, similarly as human  xxxg1582xxx  does. guinea pig gastric
pit cells constitutively express p22phox,  xxxg1509xxx , and noxa1
(data not shown); therefore, once  xxxg1582xxx  is synthesized together with nox1 in gastric mucosal cells, nox1 may result in
a “self-activated state” under constant o⫺
2 -generating conditions.
 xxxd1960xxx  was purified from pine resin and has been widely
used as a nonabsorbable antigastric ulcer agent in japan (28).
this compound adheres to ulcer regions and topically enhances
the mucosal integrity possibly through enhancing mucosal

fig. 9. interaction between h. pylori lps and  xxxd1960xxx . forty endotoxin units
(366 ng) per milliliter of h. pylori lps were incubated with the indicated
concentrations of  xxxd1960xxx  for 30 min at 37°c in rpmi 1640 medium (a). e. coli
lps (71 ␮g/ml) was incubated with 10 mg/ml of  xxxd1960xxx  in the same manner
(b). these mixtures were subjected to nondenatured gel electrophoresis using
5% polyacrylamide gels, and the gels were stained using a silver stain kit
(wako chemical, tokyo, japan).

anti-h. pylori actions of  xxxd1960xxx 

defensive factors (22, 44).  xxxd1960xxx  improves the efficacy of
antibiotic therapy for h. pylori-infected patients with peptic
ulcer (1, 16) and has been suggested to exert unknown anti-h.
pylori actions besides inhibition of urease activity (1, 16). in
this study, we found that  xxxd1960xxx  inhibited the h. pylori lpstriggered expression of both nox1 and  xxxg1582xxx  mrnas in the
10% fbs-containing medium, resulting in complete inhibition
of the priming effect of h. pylori lps (fig. 1). the anti-h.
pylori lps action of  xxxd1960xxx  was also examined in guinea pig
gastric mucosal cells maintained in the 0.1% fbs-containing
medium, in which h. pylori lps predominantly causes their
apoptosis (18).  xxxd1960xxx  blocked the h. pylori lps-triggered
activation of  xxxg342xxx , loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, release of  xxxg569xxx  from mitochondria, and activation of  xxxg341xxx , leading to significant inhibition of dna
ladder formation and appearance of apoptotic cells. il-1␤ and
tnf-␣ share distinct signaling pathways of apoptosis with
tlr4. we also examined whether  xxxd1960xxx  blocked the il-1␤or tnf-␣-triggered events. unfortunately, guinea pig gastric
mucosal cells do not constitutively express the specific receptor
for these cytokines, and neither il-1␤ nor tnf-␣ upregulated
o⫺
2 production (40) and stimulated apoptosis (data not shown).
however, we showed that  xxxd1960xxx  did not inhibit apoptosis
initiated by a common apoptosis-inducing irritant (ethanol) or
a genotoxic agent (etoposide). these results suggest that  xxxd1960xxx 
may exert anti-h. pylori actions at least in part through blocking h. pylori lps-mediated toxic effects.
next, we examined the mechanism by which  xxxd1960xxx  blocked
the lps actions. h. pylori lps stimulates tlr4 signal-transduction molecules downstream to myeloid differentiation factor 88, such as tak1 and tab1. we confirmed that  xxxd1960xxx 
inhibited the h. pylori lps-initiated phosphorylation of tak1
and tab1. a series of experiments with  xxxd1960xxx  and h. plyori
lps (fig. 8) suggested that  xxxd1960xxx  may interact with h. pylori
lps and inhibit the activation of tlr4 signaling. a recent
study suggests that tlr4 may serve as a receptor for h. pylori
binding (37), and  xxxd1960xxx  was shown to inhibit h. pylori
adhesion to gastric epithelial cells possibly by directly targeting h. pylori (12), also supporting an interaction between
 xxxd1960xxx  and h. pylori lps.
 xxxd1960xxx  becomes insoluble in acidic conditions. when h.
pylori lps was incubated with  xxxd1960xxx , acid-precipitated  xxxd1960xxx 
almost completely absorbed the endotoxin activity. furthermore, nondenatured polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis indicated a direct interaction between h. pylori lps and  xxxd1960xxx 
(fig. 9). the concentrations of  xxxd1960xxx , which produced the
mobility shift of h. pylori lps on the gel, were stoichiometrically similar to those required for the inhibition of upregulation of o⫺
2 generation or apoptosis of the cells. considering
these results,  xxxd1960xxx  is likely to have a lower, but significant
affinity for h. pylori lps. this weak interaction may be
enough to block the effects of h. pylori lps in damaging
mucosa, because patients are usually taking a high dose of
 xxxd1960xxx  (1 or 2 g twice a day).
the present study suggests that  xxxd1960xxx  is a new type of drug
having novel pharmacological actions that may specifically
target h. pylori lps and suppress the tlr4-mediated inflammation and accelerated apoptosis in gastric mucosa infected
with h. pylori. considering the safety and efficacy demonstrated in japan, this compound may have a therapeutic benefit
for long-term management of h. pylori-infected gastric muajp-gastrointest liver physiol • vol

cosa. at present, however, the molecular interaction between
lps and tlr4- xxxg1350xxx  complex has not been fully elucidated.
further experiments are still necessary to reveal the specific
molecular target(s) for  xxxd1960xxx .
