ahsrruct; this study compares the effects of threshold concentrations of  xxxg674xxx  in isolated rat basilar arteries with
those in mesenteric arterial branches and investigates the mechanisms of inhibitory and potentiating endothelin-i-effects.
in basilar arteries,  xxxg674xxx  reduces the contractions induced by 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-ht), by the thromboxane
a2 agonist u46619, and by vasopressin. the inhibitory effect of  xxxg674xxx  on the contraction induced by 5-ht is
abolished by deendothelialization, by the endothelin  xxxg677xxx  antagonist res 701-1, by indomethacin, or by  xxxd2215xxx . in mesenteric arteries, endothelin- 1 potentiates the contractile effects of 5-ht, u46619, and vasopressin. the
potentiation of the contractile effect induced by 5-ht is only somewhat modified by deendothelialization, but abolished
by the  xxxg2253xxx  antagonists gr32191 and  xxxd3115xxx . u46619 potentiates the 5-ht-effect in mesenteric
arteries. thus, though the contractile endothelin eta receptors were not blocked, threshold concentrations of endothelini inhibited contractile effects in the rat basilar artery via activation of endothelial etb receptors. prostaglandins and
atp-sensitive k+ channels are involved in this inhibitory action. in contrast,  xxxg674xxx  potentiates contractile actions
in mesenteric arteries via the release of endogeneous thromboxane a2 from non-endothelial cells. the study points out
the completely different role of the endothelium in combined effects of  xxxg674xxx  between cerebral and mesenteric
arteries.

 xxxg674xxx  is one of the most potent endogeneous vasoconstrictors known (yanagisawa et al. 1988). so far, three
isopeptides of the endothelin family have been detected. the
major isoform produced by vascular endothelial cells is  xxxg674xxx , which plays an important role in the regulation of
vascular tone (for reviews see rubanyi & polokoff 1994;
ferro &webb 1996; gray & webb 1996).  xxxg674xxx  leads
to strong and sustained vasoconstrictions. furthermore, the
presence of  xxxg674xxx  has been shown to potentiate contractile stimuli in arteries from different organs and species
(consigny 1990; yang et al. 1990; wong-dusting et al. 1991;
itoh et ul. 1992; okatani et al. 1995; hempelmann et al.
1997).this potentiating effect of  xxxg674xxx  may be of importance for the development of pathological vasoconstrictions in human coronary arteries (yang et al. 1990) as well as
in human cerebral arteries (hempelmann et al. 1997).
the aim of this study was to further investigate the mechanisms underlying the endothelin- 1-induced synergistic actions in cerebral arteries. for this purpose, we chose the rat
basilar artery. for comparison, the study presents effects
of threshold concentrations of  xxxg674xxx  in mesenteric
arterial branches.

materials and methods
isolation of rat arteries. male sprague-dawley rats (body weight
250450 g) were anaesthetized with diethylether and immediately
decapitated (a procedure suggested by the local ethics committee
for animal experimentation), the brain was carefully removed and
transferred to aerated buffer solution at room temperature. the
basilar artery was dissected out and cleaned from connective tissue
under a dissection microscope. additionally, third-order branches
from the mesenteric arterial bed were prepared in aerated solution.
circular arterial segments of the arteries  xxxd210xxx .5mm long, were
mounted onto two parallel stainless steel wires with diameters of 40
pm.the preparations were mounted onto a myograph (mulvany &
halpern 1977) and preloaded as previously described (hempelmann & ziegler 1993). the length of the segments was measured
under a microscope. when the temperature of the bathing solution
had reached 37?0.5", a passive diameter-tension curve was constructed as described by mulvany & halpern (1977). using a computer model, the vessel's internal diameter and, according to the
laplace equation, the corresponding pressure could be calculated
at any point on the passive diameter-tension curve (mcpherson
1992). after the calibration procedure was finished, the vessels were
allowed to relax to a tension that occurs at 90% of the diameter
corresponding to a transmural pressure of 100 mmhg. experiments
were recorded by a computer-assisted data recording system (macintosh, maclab, purchased from wisstech gmbh, spechbach,
germany) and, in parallel, by a multi-pen recorder (rikadenki
electronics gmbh, freiburg, germany). during the equilibration
period of 60 min., two successive exposures to 80 mmol/l k+, and
one effect of 40 mmol/l k+, each lasting for 5 min., were performed.
no significant differences could be seen between these k+ concentrations in basilar as well as in mesenteric arteries. arterial segments, that did not reach a tension corresponding to a transluminal
pressure of 100 mmhg, were discarded.

deendothelialization was performed in mounted rat basilar or
mesenteric arteries by gently rubbing off the endothelium with a
hair. the integrity of the endothelium was checked by constructing
cumulative concentration-response curves to carbachol in both vessel types as well as to noradrenaline in basilar arteries (hempelmann & ziegler 1993). in denuded vessels, the relaxations in response to carbachol and noradrenaline were abolished. in intact as
well as in denuded arteries, the most pronounced effect of the three
control stimuli by k+ at the beginning of the experiment was regarded as 100 percent of contraction.
cumulative concentration-response curves for agonists were established, awaiting a steady state contractile response before application of the next higher concentration. in each experiment, two
control concentration-response curves, separated by 30 min., were
performed before investigating the effect of a threshold concentration of endothelin-l , the second control concentration-response
curves are presented in the figures. to achieve threshold concentrations, low concentrations of endothelin- i were administered
cumulatively. the first concentration that elicited a slight contractile
effect was regarded as threshold concentration and the next concentration-response curve of the second agonist was constructed ten
minutes later. the incubation period for the endothelin  xxxg677xxx  antagonist res 701-1, indomethacin, or  xxxd2215xxx  was 30
min.
control experiments (for each condition 1124) proved, that neither res 701-1 nor  xxxd2215xxx  or indomethacin significantly altered the contractile responses to 5-ht in the basilar artery. res
701- i ,  xxxd2215xxx , and indomethacin did not influence the basal
tension
solutions. the organ bath contained 20 ml of a tyrode buffer with
the following composition (mmol/l): na+, 147; k + , 2.7; caz+,1.8;
m g z t . 1.1; cl-, 145.5; hc03-, 12; h2po4-, 0.21; glucose, 5.5;
[ethylenebis(oxyethylenenitrilo)]tetraacetic acid, 0.01; and additionally  xxxd228xxx , 5.7. high potassium buffer solution was obtained
by replacing na+ by an equimolar amount of k' in the normal
tyrode solution. when investigating the effects of threshold concentrations of  xxxg674xxx , 0.001% bovine albumin was added at the
beginning of the assay. control experiments allowed to exclude any
unspecific effects of bovine albumin on the contractile responses to
the different vasoactive agents. the buffer was bubbled with a mixture of 95%)o2 and 5% coz to maintain a ph of 7.4, the temperature was kept at 37?0.5".

the pecso(i.e. the negative logarithm of the ecso)was calculated
by fitting the data to a sigmoidal curve (four parameter logistic
equation), using the program graphpad inplot. contractile effects
are presented in percent of the maximal tone increase induced by
k+. statistical comparisons were made using the two-tailed student's t-test for paired data, regarding differences as significant
when p<0.05. data are presented as mean+s.d.
according to poch et ul. (1995), we regarded the model of independence as the adequate reference for pharmacological potentiation in complex situations, i.e. when both applied agents evoke
contractile effects. in the model of independence, the substance a
generates the same relative effects in the presence of a contractile
concentration of the substance b. thus, when the concentrationresponse curve of a exhibits the same ec5{)in the presence of the
substance b when compared whith control conditions, the effects
are looked upon as independent, and no potentiation exists. any
significant left shift of the concentration-response curve was regarded as synergistic (potentiating) effect. the respective equation
of independent actions is:
ea+b= ea+eb-(eaxeb)
where e represents the fraction of maximum possible effects (poch
et al. 1995).
in the presence of a threshold concentration of the precontracting
substance b (i.e. endothelin-l or u46619), the half maximum effect
esoof the substance a was regarded as:

where eb represents the contraction induced by the threshold concentration. hence, the calculated concentration ecsoproducing the
half maximum effect represents the relative efficacy of the substance
a in the presence of b and can be compared with the ecsoof a in
the absence of b.
the model of independence must be differentiated from the
model of additivity. in this model, the substance a can be regarded
as a dilution of the substance b or vice versa (poch et ul. 1995). and
competitive interaction of two agonists can explain this model. in
this model, the magnitude of the augmentation depends on the
slope of the concentration-response curve of the substance a. according to poch rt ul. (1995), we did not regard this model as reference for potentiation.

discussion
 xxxg674xxx  has been shown to potentiate contractile stimuli in blood vessels from different vascular regions (consigny
1990; yang et al. 1990; wong-dusting et al. 1991; itoh et al.
1992; okatani et al. 1995; hempelmann et al. 1997). these
effects have been supposed to contribute to the development
of vasospastic disorders in coronary as well as in cerebral arteries (yang et al. 1990; hempelmann et al. 1997). the aim of
the present study was to compare the potentiating effects of
threshold concentrations of  xxxg674xxx  seen in human cerebral arteries with cerebral arteries from rat and to further

investigate the mechanisms underlying the synergistic effects
of low  xxxg674xxx  concentrations, because the rat is frequently used as an animal model of cerebral ischaemia and
subarachnoid haemorrhage. however, threshold concentrations of  xxxg674xxx  exert opposite effects in rat basilar
arteries and suppress the actions of 5-ht and other vasoconstrictors. it is known, that rat cerebral and peripheral arteries
exhibit different reactions to vasoactive agents. for example,
noradrenaline causes endothelium-dependent relaxation in
the basilar artery (hempelmann & ziegler 1993) whereas it
contracts peripheral arteries. for this reason, we tried to
elucidate whether an inhibitory effect of small  xxxg674xxx 
concentrations is a general phenomenon in isolated rat arteries. indeed, in contrast to rat basilar arteries, threshold concentrations of  xxxg674xxx  potentiate contractile stimuli in
mesenteric arteries. this study presents the different mechanisms of  xxxg674xxx  in influencing the actions of 5-ht in the
basilar artery and in branches from the mesenteric arterial
bed.
endothelin receptors in rat basilar and mesenteric arteries.
 xxxg674xxx  exerts its contractile effects in the rat basilar
artery via activation of endothelin eta receptors (feger et
ul. 1994), whereas, to our knowledge, no indication for the
existence of a contractile endothelin  xxxg677xxx  has been
found in this type of vessel (kitazono et al. 1995a; schilling
et al. 1995). our experiments with bq-123 and the stronger
contractile effect of  xxxg674xxx  when compared with  xxxg675xxx  confirm that the observed contractile effects of
endothelin- 1 in basilar arteries are mediated through endothelin eta receptors.
res-701-1 was used as endothelin  xxxg677xxx  antagonist. this antagonist was investigated in the noradrenalinestimulated rat aorta (karaki et al. 1994). the relaxant effects of  xxxg675xxx  and the endothelin  xxxg677xxx 
agonist irl 1620 are comparable in the rat aorta (moritoki
et a/. 1993; karaki et al. 1993 & 1994) and in the rat basilar
artery (schilling et al. 1995 & 1996). thus, the characteristics of the endothelial endothelin etb receptors in rat
basilar arteries are comparable with those in the rat aorta,
and res-701-1 may be used as an effective antagonist in
the basilar artery.
the contractile effects of  xxxg674xxx  in rat mesenteric
arteries are mediated via endothelin eta receptors and, to
a considerably smaller extent, by endothelin etb receptors
located on the smooth muscle cells (deng et al. 1995; takase et al. 1995; sharifi & schiffrin 1996; mickley et al. 1997).
our experiments with bq-i 23 confirm that endothelin eta
receptors are predominantly responsible for the potentiating threshold effects of endothelin in mesenteric arteries.
inhibitory eflects of  xxxg674xxx  in the basilar artery.
threshold concentrations of  xxxg674xxx  inhibit contractions induced by different receptor agonists in the isolated
basilar artery. the comparable inhibition by  xxxg674xxx 
of contractile effects evoked by different agonists suggests
that the suppressor action is a general phenomenon of small

 xxxg674xxx  concentrations in rat basilar arteries and does
not depend on the nature of the interacting agonist. this
observation in rat basilar arteries is in contrast to our previous findings with 5-ht in human cerebral arteries (hempelmann et al. 1997) demonstrating that threshold concentrations of  xxxg674xxx  evoke positive synergistic effects.
endothelins are able to induce relaxant effects by the release of  xxxd2738xxx , mediated through endothelin etb receptors on endothelial cells (fujitani et al. 1993; moritoki
et al. 1993; karaki et al. 1994; yanagisawa 1994; ferro &
webb 1996). recent pharmacological studies demonstrated
the existence of endothelin etb receptors on the endothelium in rat basilar arteries in vitro (schilling et al. 1995 &
1996) and in vivo (kitazono et al. 1995a & b), which initiate
relaxation by the release of  xxxd2738xxx . the abolition of
the inhibitory effect of endothelin- 1 by deendothelialization
as well as in intact arteries by the endothelin  xxxg677xxx 
antagonist res-701-1 is in line with these previous reports.
schilling et al. (1995 & 1996) and kitazono et al.
(1995a & b) suggested  xxxd2738xxx  to mediate the relaxation
induced by  xxxg675xxx  or an endothelin etb agonist, because these effects were blocked by  xxxd2738xxx  synthase
inhibitors. the relaxation evoked by the etb agonist irl
1620 was not affected by indomethacin (kitazono et al.
1995a & b). our data, however, demonstrate that indomethacin abolishes the inhibitory effect of  xxxg674xxx  on the
contraction generated by 5-ht. thus, the release of an  xxxd208xxx  metabolite can be regarded as a mechanism
involved in the suppressor effects of endothelin-l in our experiments. release of prostacyclin by endothelin has been
reported in organs from different species (de nucci et al.
1988; rae et al. 1989; d'orleans-juste et al. 1993). we suppose that small concentrations of  xxxg674xxx  induce the
release of an  xxxd208xxx  metabolite such as prostacyclin from the endothelium of the basilar artery, leading
to suppression of subsequent vasocontractile stimuli. the
lack of an effect of indomethacin as reported by kitazono
et al. (1995a) may be explained by the author's use of irl
1620 instead of  xxxg674xxx , by the different methodological conditions (cranial window technique, in vivo conditions), and by the different rat strain. interestingly, kitazono et al. (1995b) demonstrated inhibition of the dilatory
effect of the endothelin etb agonist irl 1620 by a nitric
oxide synthase inhibitor in wistar-kyoto rats, but not in
stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats.
the suppressor effect of  xxxg674xxx  is abolished in the
presence of  xxxd2215xxx . these findings show that atpsensitive kf channels (katp) play an important role in the
inhibitory effect of threshold concentrations of endothelin1. as mentioned above, our data imply that small concentrations of  xxxg674xxx  release an  xxxd208xxx  metabolite. in rabbit coronary vessels, prostacyclin has been reported to exert its vasodilatory effects via activation of
katp (jackson et al. 1993). we suggest that the arachidonic
acid metabolite released by threshold concentrations of endothelin exerts its inhibitory actions via activation of katp
the findings demonstrate that k a t are
~ the predominant

combined effects o f  xxxg674xxx  and 5-ht in isolated arteries

pathway by which threshold concentrations of endothelin1 inhibit the contractions induced by 5-ht.
the present data show that, in contrast to our previous
findings in human cerebral arteries, threshold concentrations of  xxxg674xxx  do not potentiate contractile stimuli in the intact or denuded rat basilar artery. the effects of
low endothelin- 1 concentrations on endothelin etb receptors localized on the endothelium dominate the action of
the peptide on contractions induced by 5-ht, though the
contractile endothelin eta receptors were not blocked in
our experiments. in contrast to these findings, feger et al.
(1997) reported that a relaxant action of  xxxg674xxx  (when
administered to a precontracted segment of the rat basilar
artery) can only be detected in the presence of bq-123 to
block the contractile endothelin eta receptors. thus,
though threshold concentrations of  xxxg674xxx  elicit small
contractions, the relaxant effect of  xxxg674xxx  is substantially unmasked in our experiments when the peptide is
given before other vasoactive substances are administered.
potentiating effects of  xxxg674xxx  in mesenteric arteries.
threshold concentrations of  xxxg674xxx  shifted the concentration-response curve to 5-ht to the left and significantly enhanced the maximum contractile effect. according
to poch rt al. (1995), a shift to the left of a concentrationresponse curve to a substance a in the presence of a fixed
concentration of a substance b represents a potentiation,
regarding the model of independence as the adequate reference for potentiation in complex situations (when both substances exert effects, see “materials and methods”). thus,
the contractile effect of 5-ht in rat mesenteric arteries is
potentiated by endothelin-l . potentiating effects are also
seen between endothelin-l on the one hand and u46619 or
vasopressin on the other hand, showing that potentiation
of contractile stimuli is a general phenomenon of low concentrations of  xxxg674xxx  in rat mesenteric arteries and
does not depend on the nature of the interacting agonist.
the abolition of the  xxxg674xxx -induced increase of the 5ht-effect in the presence of the thromboxane a2 antagonist
gr 32191 and the  xxxg2253xxx  antagonist/
thromboxane a2 synthesis inhibitor furegrelate suggests,
that  xxxg674xxx  exerts its synergistic actions in the mesenteric artery by the release of thromboxane a2. if this suggestion is correct, we would expect a potentiation of the 5-hteffect by thromboxane a2 or by the agonist u46619 itself:
threshold concentrations of u46619 shifted the concentration-response curve of 5-ht significantly to the left. this
observation supports the suggestion of a potentiation of endothelin-i-effects by a release of thromboxane a2. in deendothelialized arteries, the potentiating effect of endothelin1 is not abolished. thus, the endogeneous thromboxane a2
derives mainly from non-endothelial cells, presumably
smooth muscle cells. phosholipase a2 activation by endothelin- 1 has been demonstrated in cultured smooth muscle
cells (resink et al. 1989). the failure of the thromboxane
a2 receptor antagonist gr 32191 to affect the contraction
elicited by 5-ht and  xxxg674xxx  (for each condition n=6,

121

results not shown) excludes unspecific effects of the antagonist on the actions of 5-ht and  xxxg674xxx  .
conclusions
1) threshold concentrations of endothelin- 1 that induce
slight contractile responses, suppress the effects of other
agonists in the rat basilar artery via activation of endothelin
etb receptors localized on the endothelium, even when the
contractile endothelin eta receptors are not blocked. thus,
the rat basilar artery differs substantially from human cerebral arteries. 2 ) an  xxxd208xxx  metabolite and katp
channels are involved in the endothelin etb-mediated inhibitory effect of  xxxg674xxx . 3) in contrast to the basilar
artery,  xxxg674xxx  exerts synergistic effects in rat mesenteric arteries. 4) these potentiating effects of endothelin- 1
seem to be due to the release of endogeneous thromboxane
a2. 5) the effects of threshold concentrations of  xxxg674xxx  differ substantially in the rat basilar artery and in mesenteric arteries. the study demonstrates the dominant role
of the endothelium in effects of low  xxxg674xxx  concentrations in cerebral arteries when compared with peripheral
arteries.
