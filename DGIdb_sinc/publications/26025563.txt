abstract
context prostate cancer remains highly prevalent and
has a poor clinical outcome once metastatic.  xxxd3205xxx 
is an autologous cellular immunotherapy approved for the
treatment of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer
(mcrpc).  xxxd3205xxx  treatment extends survival but is
independent of traditional short-term markers of treatment
response observed with chemotherapy and contemporary
hormonal treatments. therefore, it is essential that clinicians understand the mechanism of action of  xxxd3205xxx 
and how this can translate in the clinic.
objective this article aims to summarize the current knowledge of  xxxd3205xxx  therapy and its effects in
mcrpc.
evidence acquisition relevant publications describing  xxxd3205xxx  clinical data and information relating to
immunotherapies were identified.
evidence synthesis treatment with  xxxd3205xxx  extends
survival, with side effects being usually mild or moderate
and manageable within the outpatient setting. the longterm immune responses generated by  xxxd3205xxx  correlate with a survival benefit.  xxxd3205xxx  shows a greater

conclusions  xxxd3205xxx  stimulates long-lived immune
responses that translate into long-term clinical benefit. the
treatment course (three infusions at weeks 0, 2, and 4) is
associated with manageable side effects. short-term markers of future benefit would be clinically useful, and information on effective treatment combinations or sequences is
awaited.
patient summary  xxxd3205xxx  treatment directs the
patient’s own immune system to target and remove prostate cancer cells and increases life expectancy. patients
whose cancer is less advanced generally have a more
‘active’ immune system and may benefit the most from this
treatment.

introduction
approximately 400,000 men are diagnosed with prostate
cancer in europe each year, equating to almost a quarter of
all male cancers [1]. around 90,000 prostate cancer-related
deaths occur annually in europe, giving it the third highest
mortality rate after lung and colon cancers [1], and in the
usa, it is surpassed only by lung cancer [2].
men with localized prostate cancer are generally treated
with active surveillance, brachytherapy, surgery, or radiotherapy with or without androgen deprivation therapy
(adt), depending on the individual prognosis [3]. patients
treated with adt alone for metastatic disease usually
respond well, but ultimately biochemical relapse and disease progression may occur. castration-resistant prostate
cancer (crpc) may be suspected in patients with new
symptoms, rising  xxxg1281xxx  (psa) levels,
or other new evidence of disease while being treated with
adt [4]. treatment options for patients who progress to
metastatic crpc (mcrpc) have evolved dramatically over
recent years and include the following: immunotherapy
with  xxxd3205xxx  [5, 6]; androgen biosynthesis inhibition
with  xxxd55xxx  acetate and prednisone [7]; androgen signaling inhibition with  xxxd2003xxx  [8]; chemotherapy in
combination with steroids, such as docetaxel or  xxxd399xxx 
and prednisone; and bone-targeted agents including the
radioisotope radium-223 dichloride [9]. additional immunotherapies are under investigation for mcrpc, such as the
cytotoxic t-lymphocyte antigen 4 inhibitor ipilimumab, for
which phase iii trial results were recently published [10].
 xxxd3205xxx  is an autologous cellular immunotherapy
that is indicated for the treatment of asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic mcrpc [11]. in april 2010,  xxxd3205xxx  became the first us food and drug administration
(fda)-approved immunotherapy following the demonstration of significant overall survival (os) improvement in
patients with primarily asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic mcrpc [5, 12, 13].  xxxd3205xxx  was also recently

approved by the european medicines agency (ema) for
the treatment of asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic
metastatic (non-visceral) crpc in male adults in whom
chemotherapy is not yet clinically indicated [14]. a european study of  xxxd3205xxx  is ongoing across centers in
vienna, nijmegen, london, and paris, with the product
manufactured in maastricht (the netherlands) using the
standard methodology (see section ‘manufacture of  xxxd3205xxx ’). in addition,  xxxd3205xxx  is being explored in
earlier and later settings, and the initial findings have been
positive [15]. in clinical trials,  xxxd3205xxx  was well tolerated and had manageable side effects [16]; the majority of adverse events were mild or moderate and could be
managed in an outpatient setting. in order to appreciate
the long-term clinical benefits of  xxxd3205xxx  treatment, it
is important to understand how these are derived from its
mode of action.

evidence acquisition
relevant publications presenting data on  xxxd3205xxx  treatment, predominantly from key clinical trials, were identified. additional articles commenting on these data, and on
the results achieved with  xxxd3205xxx  and other immunotherapies, were also included.

evidence synthesis
data and other information from the identified publications
were collated and are presented below.
manufacture of sipuleucel‑t
 xxxd3205xxx  uses the patient’s own cells to stimulate an
immune response against  xxxg46xxx  (pap),
which is an appropriate target as it is expressed almost
exclusively by prostate cells. the potential for inappropriate immune reactions is limited because  xxxd3205xxx  is
composed of the patient’s own cells.
the first step in the manufacture of  xxxd3205xxx  is to isolate
the patient’s peripheral blood mononuclear cells (pbmcs),
including antigen-presenting cells (apcs) such as dendritic
cells, macrophages, and b cells, using leukapheresis (fig. 1).
these cells are then cultured in vitro for 36–44 h with a fusion
protein, pa2024, composed of recombinant pap fused to
granulocyte–macrophage  xxxg526xxx  ( xxxg526xxx ), a cytokine that stimulates apcs. stimulating apcs ex
vivo is thought to be an effective approach for initiating an
immune response away from the potentially immunosuppressive effects of the prostate tumor. ex vivo pa2024-activated
apcs have been shown to process and display fragments

leukocytes are harvested from the patient by leukapheresis and sent
for processing, in which monocytes are enriched by density-gradient
centrifugation. the monocytes are incubated with the pa2024 fusion
protein of pap and gm-csf. pa2024 is taken up by immature apcs,
such as dcs, and enhances their maturation. the resulting ‘product’
is returned to the clinic and administered intravenously to the patient.
theoretically, the transfused apcs will present pap-derived peptides
to the host immune system in vivo, activating cd4+ and cd8+ t

cells and initiating adaptive immune responses. adapted by permission from macmillan publishers ltd: nature reviews immunology

of the pap moiety on the cell surface [18]. the sipuleucelt product is then reinfused back into the patient, where the
activated apcs stimulate an immune response against pap
and consequently against the cancerous prostatic cells. the
potency of  xxxd3205xxx  may be assessed by the upregulation
of cluster of differentiation 54 ( xxxg1127xxx ) on apcs (measured as
an increase in the ratio of the average number of molecules
of  xxxg1127xxx  on apcs pre- vs post-culture with pa2024) [18].
cumulative apc activation and apc number correlated with
os in an analysis of three randomized controlled phase iii
trials [19]. thus, current  xxxd3205xxx  manufacture requires
that the product contains a minimum of 50 million autologous  xxxg1127xxx + cells [11]. the complete treatment involves three
cycles 2 weeks apart (weeks 0, 2, and 4), with each cycle
comprising fresh leukapheresis, cell isolation and culture with
pa2024, and reinfusion. the  xxxd3205xxx  product contains t
cells, apcs, natural killer cells, and b cells, and the cellular
composition does not change between treatment weeks nor
between pre-culture compared with the final product [19].

and cumulative (across the three infusions) post-culture in
vitro apc activation, apc count, and total nucleated cell
(tnc) count, which remained after adjusting for baseline
psa and lactate dehydrogenase (ldh) levels (fig. 2) [19].
there is evidence to suggest that antigen-specific t and b
cell responses developed following the first  xxxd3205xxx  infusion, and that these were re-stimulated during the subsequent
co-cultures. cytokines that are associated with t cell activation
were detected in culture medium from the second and third in
vitro co-cultures, and included interleukin (il)-2, il-4,  xxxg1180xxx ,
il-6, il-10, il-13,  xxxg1166xxx ,  xxxg1141xxx  (ifngamma), ifngammainducible protein 10, and  xxxg2296xxx  alpha [19, 20].
in addition, levels of the t cell activation markers cd134 and
cd137 were increased on cd4+ and cd8+ t cells after culture with pa2024, and there was evidence of b cell maturation and activation [20]. furthermore, pa2024-specific t cell
‘recall’ responses, measured by antigen-specific proliferation
and ifngamma production, could be detected in pre-culture cells
from the second and particularly the third leukapheresis [19,
20]. this suggests that functional t cell responses were generated in the body after the first infusion and were subsequently
boosted after the second infusion. each of these findings reinforces the hypothesis that  xxxd3205xxx  treatment induces an
immunologic ‘prime-boost’ response.

engagement of the immune system during manufacture
of sipuleucel‑t
significant levels of in vitro apc activation, measured by
 xxxg1127xxx  upregulation, are induced during co-culture of the
patient’s cells with pa2024 [18–20]. greater increases in
apc activation are seen during the second and third (weeks
2 and 4) in vitro co-cultures compared with the first (week
0). this response profile is akin to that generated by traditional vaccines—a prime-boost effect is observed after
the first dose when administering sequential vaccinations.
significant positive correlations were observed between os

post‑treatment immune responses with sipuleucel‑t
and correlation with os
t cell responses, such as proliferation and ifngamma production
in response to stimulation with either pa2024 or pap, could
be detected in pbmcs from the majority of patients treated
with  xxxd3205xxx  [19]. this indicates that the treatment

generated prostate antigen-specific immune responses. preliminary evidence also suggests that this peripheral blood
immune response has a direct effect within the prostate, as
demonstrated by an increased number of leukocytes around
the tumor site [21]. in the neoadjuvant setting, patients with
non-metastatic prostate cancer who were treated with  xxxd3205xxx  displayed a ≥3-fold increase in mean cells/area at
the tumor interface for total t cells, cd4+ helper t cells, and
cd8+ cytotoxic t cells, compared with pre-treatment biopsy
or with non-interface areas of benign or malignant tissue [21].
robust post-treatment antibody responses specific to
pa2024 and pap have also been detected in the majority of patients treated with  xxxd3205xxx , but not in control patients [19]. in the majority of  xxxd3205xxx -treated
patients, antigen-specific antibodies remained present
at detectable levels in serum for at least 26 weeks. the
majority of the antibody responses were initially immunoglobulin m, with immunoglobulin g antibodies emerging
2–4 weeks after the last infusion. this isotype switching is
consistent with vaccine-induced immunologic memory. in
addition, anti-tetanus antibody responses were unchanged
after  xxxd3205xxx  treatment, indicating that bystander
immune responses were not generated.
antibodies in the systemic circulation may, theoretically, reach many tissues, potentially allowing the destruction of malignant cells throughout the body and resulting
in long-term, widespread immunosurveillance. there is
also potential for the immune system to recognize additional ‘nontarget’ cancer antigens through a process known
as epitope spreading, to enable it to better identify and
remove cancerous cells. epitope spreading is particularly
noted in the development of long-term antibody responses.
this antigen cascade event may explain why os

significantly correlated with an antibody response against
pa2024 [hazard ratio (hr) 0.42; p < 0.001] [19] and highlights the importance of humoral immunity in this context.
os also significantly correlated with the development of
either a functional t cell response (above) or a humoral
response (fig. 3).
overall, these data support the concept that engagement of
key immune cell types (apcs, t, and b cells) during sipuleucelt treatment contributes to the os benefit. however, there are
additional data to suggest that engagement of ‘less prominent’
immune cell types could also be important. approximately
30 % of the patients in three phase iii trials experienced a transient increase in peripheral blood eosinophil counts from week
6 to week 14, directly after completion of  xxxd3205xxx  treatment
[22]. eosinophils are often considered to be rare, cytotoxic cells
that are only relevant in parasitic infections and asthma [23].
however, there is increasing evidence that eosinophils may be
involved in the generation of  xxxd3205xxx  antitumor immune
responses [23]. this may be through interactions with t cells
(recruitment and polarization or direct antitumor activity), b cells
(antibody responses), or dendritic cells (activation/recruitment).
indeed, the transient, elevated eosinophil counts in patients
receiving  xxxd3205xxx  correlated with os, prostate cancer-specific survival, and antigen-specific humoral responses [22].

optimizing the use of sipuleucel‑t
surrogate markers for os
unlike traditional chemotherapy,  xxxd3205xxx  treatment is
associated with a long-term os benefit but not a reduction
in time to objective disease progression (defined by at least

the sum of the products of diameters for index lesions; the
new appearance or unequivocal progression of non-index
lesions; at least two new lesions on bone scanning; and/or
a new pathologic fracture or spinal cord compression [5]).
the same phenomenon has been noted with other immunotherapies. for example, treatment with psa-tricom
did not increase time to prostate cancer progression but
achieved a significant improvement in 3-year os {30 % vs.
17 %; hr 0.56 [95 % confidence interval (ci), 0.37–0.85]}
and median survival (25.1 vs. 16.6 months; p = 0.0061)
versus control [6]. similarly, in melanoma, ipilimumab
treatment did not result in an improvement in median progression-free survival (pfs), but a significant extension of
median os was achieved (10.1 months in ipilimumab arms)
compared with active control (6.4 months; p < 0.001 and
p = 0.003, respectively) [24]. therefore, traditional shortterm indicators of long-term survival benefits may not be
appropriate with  xxxd3205xxx  or other immunotherapies.
this seeming discrepancy may relate to the immunomodulatory mode of action. antigen-specific immune
responses take time to generate, and therefore tumor
shrinkage may be delayed compared with traditional therapies (fig. 4a) [25, 26]. it is also likely that an initial inflammatory influx of leukocytes into a tumor could lead to an
initial, nonpathogenic increase in size, followed by a subsequent, long-term antitumor response [25]. thus, immunologic memory could enable the body to continue to fight
the tumor and slow its growth long after the immunotherapeutic treatment has been completed [25, 26]. furthermore, theoretically, long-term immunosurveillance could
act throughout the body as well as within the prostate,
and could potentially target metastatic cells, limiting their
spread.

clinically, short-term markers of future benefit from
immunotherapies would be very useful. in this regard, the
transient increase in eosinophil counts in peripheral blood,
noted from week 6 to week 14, may play a role given that
this correlates with os [22]. eosinophil counts are routinely measured in this context; therefore, after further
investigation and validation, elevated eosinophil counts
could be a potentially useful surrogate marker.
sipuleucel‑t’s position within the treatment paradigm
 xxxd3205xxx  was evaluated in three randomized phase iii
studies [d9901: nct00005947; d9902a: nct01133704;
and immunotherapy for prostate adenocarcinoma treatment (impact; d9902b): nct00065442] of patients
with asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic mcrpc,
and consistent improvements in os, compared with placebo, were observed across the studies [5, 12, 13, 16].
fda and ema approval of  xxxd3205xxx  was based primarily on the pivotal impact study which demonstrated that
 xxxd3205xxx  was associated with improved median survival
(4.1 months; 25.8 vs. 21.7 months in the  xxxd3205xxx  and
control arms, respectively), increased 3-year survival (31.7
vs. 23.0 % in the  xxxd3205xxx  and control arms, respectively) and a 22.5 % reduction in risk of death (hr 0.78;
95 % ci 0.61–0.98; p = 0.03). although there were more
adverse events in the  xxxd3205xxx  group, compared with
the placebo group, these events were primarily related to
leukapheresis and infusion. most events were mild to moderate (typically chills, fever, fatigue, nausea, and/or headache), occurred within 1 day of infusion, and resolved
within 1–2 days, with very few patients (0.9 %) prematurely discontinuing  xxxd3205xxx  therapy [5].
a commentary by huber et al. [27] questioned the trial
design and the validity of the results from the impact
study. the following concerns were raised: (1) unexpected
interactions between patient age and survival, (2) older
patients in the placebo group appeared to have shorter os
than might be expected based on the results of other studies, and (3) the number of cells harvested and reinfused to
the patients. three subsequent publications rebutted these
concerns [28–30] and presented clear explanations as to
why, due to comparisons between asymmetric and small
subgroups, and a lack of evaluable data, the article by
huber et al. was misleading. moreover, independent bodies, such as the fda and the center for medicare and medicaid services, also found the issues raised by huber et al.
not to be credible, supporting the published rebuttals. in
summary, the claims made by huber et al. were considered
to be unfounded, a view supported overwhelmingly by the
regulatory bodies and key thought leaders in the field.
further to the above-summarized clinical trial data supporting improvements in os of patients with asymptomatic

661

or minimally symptomatic mcrpc treated with sipuleucelt, several lines of evidence support  xxxd3205xxx  use earlier
within the treatment paradigm. treating patients earlier in
the disease course would allow more time for the immune
response to develop and would theoretically allow patients
to benefit most from the long-term os advantage (fig. 4b).
in addition, several factors associated with improved survival
following  xxxd3205xxx  treatment, such as apc activation
and transient elevations in eosinophil counts, are greater or
more frequent in patients with characteristics of earlier-stage
disease [15, 22, 27]. indeed, the cumulative fold increase in
apc activation, as measured by  xxxg1127xxx  upregulation, was
significantly greater in patients with earlier-stage disease;
the fold increase was 35.5 in neoadjuvant patients, 28.7 in
asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic mcrpc patients,
and 21.8 in mcrpc patients (p < 0.0001; joncheere-terpstra
test) [31]. in addition, patients with characteristics of earlier-stage disease may show greater os [32], a greater time
to first opioid analgesic use, and a trend toward a delay in
time to disease-related pain after  xxxd3205xxx  treatment than
those with later-stage disease characteristics [33].
future directions with sipuleucel‑t in the management
of prostate cancer
several ongoing and planned studies will investigate further the optimal role for  xxxd3205xxx  in the management of
prostate cancer (table 1). these trials are addressing several aspects of  xxxd3205xxx  therapy, such as use in earlier
treatment settings (neoadjuvant, hormone sensitive, and
non-metastatic) and the combination of  xxxd3205xxx  with
other agents (chemotherapy, radiotherapy, adt,  xxxd55xxx 
acetate, and immunotherapeutics). use of  xxxd3205xxx  earlier in the prostate cancer paradigm may have considerable
benefits to patients, since these patients are generally able
to mount more robust immune responses [15, 22, 27], and
there may be more time for the sustained, durable immune
responses to exert their clinical benefit [32–34]. preliminary
data on the use of  xxxd3205xxx  before, concurrently with,
or after additional anticancer therapies are also encouraging. in the impact trial,  xxxd3205xxx  use was associated
with increased survival versus placebo irrespective of previous chemotherapy or docetaxel use, radiotherapy, prostatectomy, orchiectomy, castration, or combined androgen blockade [5]. in addition, a  xxxd3205xxx  treatment effect was
observed in patients with and without subsequent docetaxel
use [35]. preliminary data from the p11-3 study suggest that
treatment with  xxxd55xxx  acetate and prednisone does not
substantially affect the leukocyte yield for most patients,
and that  xxxd3205xxx  can, therefore, be successfully manufactured alongside the use of these agents [36]. the potential effects of treatment sequencing on clinical outcomes
are also under investigation. preliminary interim results

from the phase ii stand trial (sequencing of sipuleucelt and adt in men with non-metastatic prostate cancer;
nct01431391) show that combination treatment with adt
followed by  xxxd3205xxx  may augment immune responses,
which could potentially increase efficacy compared with
either treatment alone [37].

conclusions
new, effective drugs with different mechanisms of action are
essential for the treatment of prostate cancer, which remains
highly prevalent and has both a high mortality rate and poor
clinical outcome after biochemical relapse.  xxxd3205xxx  is
a significant advance in the treatment of mcrpc and provides clinicians with an additional effective therapy. treatment with  xxxd3205xxx  extends survival and is associated
with easily manageable side effects, which are usually mild.
few patients prematurely discontinue  xxxd3205xxx  therapy,
and substantial long-term benefits can be achieved with just
a 4-week treatment course. research is ongoing to identify
short-term markers of the long-term clinical benefits of  xxxd3205xxx  treatment, to investigate its use in earlier disease
settings, and in combination with other therapies.
