influence of sibutramine treatment on
sympathetic vasomotor tone in obese
subjects
background: sibutramine, a serotonin and  xxxg2148xxx  blocker, is used as adjunctive obesity
treatment. studies in healthy subjects suggested that sibutramine might have opposing effects on peripheral
and central sympathetic activity; an increase in blood pressure has been claimed. direct measurements of
muscle sympathetic nerve activity (msna) in sibutramine-treated patients have not been conducted.
methods and results: twenty nondiabetic obese men and women completed the study (mean body mass index, 35
ⴞ 3 kg/m2; mean age, 42 ⴞ 8 years). they were treated for 5 days with 15 mg sibutramine per day or matching
placebo in a randomized, double-blind, crossover fashion. at the end of each intervention, heart rate, blood
pressure, and msna were recorded. patients underwent cold pressor testing and phenylephrine and nitroprusside
infusions.
results: the mean blood pressure (systolic/diastolic) was 118 ⴞ 13 mm hg/70 ⴞ 9 mm hg with placebo and
120 ⴞ 13 mm hg/69 ⴞ 8 mm hg with sibutramine (p ⴝ .29). the mean resting msna was 28 ⴞ 14 bursts/min
with placebo and 12 ⴞ 10 bursts/min with sibutramine (p < .0001). sibutramine attenuated the rise in blood
pressure (25 ⴞ 9 mm hg/9 ⴞ 9 mm hg versus 31 ⴞ 12 mm hg/14 ⴞ 9 mm hg, p < .01) and msna (0.3 ⴞ
0.5 arbitrary units/min versus 1.0 ⴞ 1.1 arbitrary units/min, p ⴝ .01) in response to cold pressor testing.
baroreflex heart rate control was similar with sibutramine and with placebo. the sympathetic baroreflex was
shifted such that at a given blood pressure, msna was substantially decreased (top, 44 ⴞ 1.23 bursts/min versus
58 ⴞ 2.99 bursts/min [p < .001]; center point, 65 ⴞ 0.32 mm hg versus 67 ⴞ 0.81 mm hg [p < .05]).
conclusions: sibutramine treatment profoundly and selectively reduces sympathetic nerve traffic at rest and
attenuates the responsiveness to sympathetic stimuli. our data support the idea that sibutramine’s peripheral
sympathomimetic effect is counteracted by a central sympatholytic mechanism. (clin pharmacol ther 2006;79:

many obese patients do not achieve and maintain
sufficient weight loss with diet and exercise alone. in
these patients a combination of diet and exercise with
antiobesity medications may be useful.1 the serotonin
and norepinephrine uptake inhibitor sibutramine is a
widely used antiobesity drug.2– 4 sibutramine mediates
increased satiety, although a mild increase in energy
expenditure may also contribute to weight loss.5,6
when applied locally to peripheral tissues,  xxxg2148xxx  blockade increases norepinephrine
overflow.7 there have been concerns that norepinephrine uptake inhibition with sibutramine could induce or
worsen arterial hypertension. however, in a recent

clinical pharmacology & therapeutics
2006;79(5):500-8

analysis of 2 placebo-controlled trials, sibutramine did
not elicit a major pressor response in either normotensive patients or hypertensive patients.8 the observation
suggests that sibutramine’s effect on the sympathetic
nervous system may be more complex than previously
believed. studies in animals and in humans suggest that
norepinephrine uptake inhibition has a much greater
effect on sympathetic activity than serotonin uptake
inhibition.9,10 in the central nervous system  xxxg2148xxx  blockade attenuates sympathetic
outflow through activation of ␣2-adrenergic receptors.11 the central effect may counteract the peripheral
sympathetic stimulation. indeed, systemic application
of norepinephrine uptake–inhibiting drugs is associated
with complex and opposing cardiovascular autonomic
effects.12–15 for example, sibutramine ingestion over a
few days attenuates the pressor response to sympathetic
stimuli.13 this finding suggested a central nervous sympatholytic (“clonidine-like”) effect. however, the notion has not been validated with direct sympathetic
nerve recordings. furthermore, the interaction of peripheral and central nervous mechanisms makes it difficult to predict the cardiovascular response to sibutramine in obese patients who may have alterations in
sympathetic activity.16 –18 to address these issues, we
tested the effect of sibutramine ingestion on the regulation of sympathetic vasomotor tone at rest and during
sympathetic stimulation in obese subjects.
methods
subjects. we recruited men and women aged between 18 and 60 years with a body mass index of 30
kg/m2 or greater but less than 40 kg/m2. patients with
blood pressure (systolic/diastolic) greater than 160 mm
hg/100 mm hg or with secondary causes of obesity,
diabetes mellitus, and other serious comorbid conditions were not included in the study. written informed
consent was obtained before study entry. the institutional review board approved all studies.
protocol. studies with sibutramine and matching
placebo were conducted on separate days in a doubleblind crossover fashion after an overnight fast. subjects
ingested 15 mg sibutramine per day or placebo for 5
days before testing. the last dose was ingested on the
morning of the assessment of sympathetic regulation on
average 3.5 hours before the baseline recording. the
washout phase between placebo and sibutramine treatment was at least 3 weeks. repeated determination of
muscle sympathetic nerve activity (msna) is technically difficult and may be unsuccessful. therefore, in
patients with poor-quality or unsuccessful msna recordings, each treatment phase could be repeated with-

out breaking the blinding of the study. repeated testing
was required in 4 patients, once with placebo and 3
times with sibutramine. a dietitian encouraged patients
before distribution of test medications to maintain food
intake and body weight. the primary predefined end
point of the study was the change in resting msna
quantified as bursts per minute with sibutramine. sympathetic activation during cold pressor testing affects
different msna parameters, namely, burst number,
burst amplitude, and burst duration. therefore we quantified the msna response to cold pressor testing by the
total msna (cumulative area under the bursts per
minute), thus accounting for all 3 parameters.
assessment of sympathetic regulation. testing was
conducted at the franz-volhard clinical research center, berlin, germany. patients were asked to empty the
bladder, and instrumentation was then performed, starting with the insertion of an intravenous catheter. respiration and electrocardiography were measured continuously (cardioscreen; medis, ilmenau, germany).
arterial blood pressure was determined with an automated oscillometric brachial cuff (dinamap; critikon,
tampa, fla). cardiac output was monitored by use of
impedance cardiography.19 systemic vascular resistance was calculated as the quotient of mean arterial
blood pressure and cardiac output.
msna was recorded from the right peroneal nerve.
a unipolar tungsten electrode (uninsulated tip diameter
of 1-5 ␮m, shaft diameter of 200 ␮m) was inserted into
the muscle nerve fascicles of the peroneal nerve at the
fibular head or the popliteal space for multiunit recordings. proper needle positioning was verified by the
following criteria: (1) tapping on the innervated muscle
but not stroking the skin elicited afferent nerve activity;
(2) bolus injections of sodium nitroprusside and inspiratory breath-holding induced or increased the burst
frequency but startling did not; (3) there was pulse
synchrony of the bursts; (4) the largest bursts in the
integrated nerve signal had a signal-to-noise ratio
greater than 3; (5) there was a biphasic response to the
valsalva maneuver; (6) internal electrical stimulation
caused muscle twitches without paresthesia. nerve activity was amplified with a total gain of 100,000,
bandpass-filtered (0.7-2 khz), and integrated as described previously.20
after a stable baseline was reached, we obtained a
baseline recording. afterward, blood samples were
drawn from an intravenous catheter for the determination of plasma catecholamine levels. subjects then underwent cold pressor testing by placing the hand in 4°c
water for 2 minutes. thereafter incremental infusions

between nitroprusside and phenylephrine infusion, patients rested until a stable hemodynamic state was attained. the infusions were stopped after the maximum
dose of 1.6 ␮g · kg⫺1 · min⫺1 was reached, the
systolic blood pressure had changed by 25 mm hg or
more, or the patient had side effects from the drug
infusion. we averaged heart rate and msna measurements during minutes 3 and 6 of each infusion step and
obtained corresponding blood pressure measurements
to determine baroreflex regulation and drug sensitivities.
data acquisition and analysis. data were converted
from analog to digital at 500 hz by use of windaq
pro⫹ software (dataq instruments, akron, ohio). r-r
intervals, diastolic and systolic blood pressure values,
and respiration were defined offline for the complete
records by use of a program written by one of the
authors (a.d.) that is based on pv-wave software
(visual numerics, san ramon, calif). msna bursts
were identified after the integrated signal was filtered
and the baseline was defined according to following
criteria: (1) signal-to-noise ratio greater than 2, (2)
latency limit, (3) burst-width limit (short duration, artifact; long duration, skin sympathetic nerve activity or
afferent activity), and (4) no preceding premature
beats.20

statistics. all data are expressed as mean ⫾ sd.
intraindividual differences were compared by the

paired t test. we plotted the r-r interval and msna
during incremental nitroprusside and phenylephrine infusions over blood pressure to assess baroreflex regulation. cardiac baroreflex curves were obtained by relating r-r intervals to systolic arterial pressures with
consideration of the fact that cardiac vagal neurons are
excited predominantly by baroreflex afferents during
systole. sympathetic discharges, on the other hand,
originate from disinhibition of the sympathetic premotor neurons during the diastolic pressure trough. therefore sympathetic activity has been related to diastolic
arterial pressure for the determination of sympathetic
baroreflex curves. baroreflex curves were fitted by use
of the boltzmann sigmoidal equation (y ⫽ bottom ⫹
[top ⫺ bottom]/1 ⫹ exp[(v50 ⫺ x/slope)]) (graphpad
prism software, version 4; graphpad software, san
diego, calif), where bottom and top represent the
lower and upper bounds of the baroreflex curves, respectively, and v50 denotes the center point (ie, the
arterial pressure [x] at which the heart rate or sympathetic response [y] is halfway between the bottom and
top). the curve fits were weighted for number and
scatter of measurements, and their parameters were
compared by use of the f test. p ⬍ .05 was considered
significant.
we assessed phenylephrine and nitroprusside sensitivity by plotting individual dose-response data (ie,
changes in arterial pressure over infusion rates) using
linear dose scales. we calculated the slope of the resulting dose-response curves by means of linear regression analysis.
results
we screened 23 obese patients (fig 1, top). one
patient refused to participate and was not randomized.
a second patient did not show up for the second evaluation. in another patient a transient viral illness was
diagnosed during the study. in the remaining 20 patients we obtained good-quality microneurography recordings, during both placebo and sibutramine administration (13 women and 7 men; mean age, 42 ⫾ 8
years).

discussion
we tested the effect of the widely used antiobesity
drug sibutramine on cardiovascular autonomic regulation at rest and during sympathetic stimulation in obese
hypertensive patients. sibutramine did not affect resting blood pressure but increased heart rate. however,
sympathetic vasomotor tone at the level of the peroneal
nerve was profoundly reduced, both at rest and during
sympathetic stimulation. thus our study confirms and
extends a previous study in normal-weight subjects
who did not undergo microneurography.13
sibutramine attenuates neuronal norepinephrine and
serotonin uptake. theoretically, sibutramine could influence sympathetic regulation through changes in norepinephrine turnover, changes in serotonin turnover, or
both mechanisms combined. in anesthetized rabbits
selective inhibition of neuronal serotonin uptake had no
effect on heart rate, arterial pressure, postganglionic
renal sympathetic nerve activity, and norepinephrine
spillover.9 sympathoinhibition at a higher concentration of “selective” serotonin uptake inhibitors was attributed to neuronal norepinephrine uptake inhibition.9
another study compared heart rate responses to placebo,  xxxd3089xxx , citalopram, and amitriptyline in terms
of heart rate regulation in healthy young men.10 selective serotonin uptake inhibition had no effect on heart

rate regulation. thus changes in autonomic cardiovascular regulation with sibutramine in our study are probably related to changes in norepinephrine uptake. however, we cannot exclude a subtle effect of serotonin
uptake inhibition on cardiovascular autonomic regulation.
sibutramine inhibits norepinephrine uptake in peripheral tissues and in the brain. thus the overall effect
of sibutramine on cardiovascular regulation results
from a complex interaction of peripheral and central
nervous system mechanisms. when applied locally to
peripheral tissues,  xxxg2148xxx  blockade
increases norepinephrine overflow.7 if norepinephrine
uptake were reduced only in peripheral tissues, one
would expect to see a substantial increase in resting
blood pressure and exacerbation of the pressor response
to sympathetic stimulation. instead, sibutramine attenuated the pressor response to cold pressor testing in our
study and in previous studies in young, normal-weight
subjects13 and in obese hypertensive patients.23 these
findings suggest that the effects on peripheral norepi-

nephrine transporter inhibition with sibutramine, which
tends to increase blood pressure, are apparently compensated for by another mechanism.
one mechanism that could attenuate the pressor response to sibutramine is a central sympatholytic effect.
the idea is supported by the observation that short-term
treatment with sibutramine and other norepinephrine
transporter inhibitors reduces low-frequency systolic
blood pressure oscillations, so-called mayer waves.13–15
mayer waves are related to oscillations in sympathetic
vasomotor discharge that are generated in the central
nervous system.24 microneurography provides a more
direct measure of sympathetic outflow from the central
nervous system. by use of this method, the norepinephrine transport inhibitors desipramine and  xxxd3089xxx 
were shown to suppress sympathetic vasomotor tone in
healthy subjects.12,15 in this study we demonstrated that
sibutramine decreased sympathetic vasomotor tone at
rest and during sympathetic stimulation in obese patients. finally,  xxxg2148xxx  inhibition

with desipramine has been shown to reduce wholebody norepinephrine spillover.12 taken together, all of
these findings suggest that medications that inhibit neuronal norepinephrine uptake reduce centrally generated
sympathetic activity at rest.
sibutramine also modulated the response to sympathetic stimuli. stimuli that are normally followed by
robust increases in blood pressure and msna, such as
handgrip or cold pressor testing, elicited a much
smaller response during sibutramine treatment.13 animal studies suggest that the reduction in sympathetic
activity with norepinephrine uptake inhibition is explained by a direct central nervous mechanism. sympathetic activity and blood pressure decreased in rabbits
when the nonselective  xxxg2148xxx  inhibitor desipramine was applied locally to the brain.11
the sympathetic inhibition with desipramine was attenuated with ␣2-adrenergic receptor blockade.11 thus the
reduction in sympathetic activity with norepinephrine
uptake inhibition appears to be mediated in part through
central nervous ␣2-adrenergic receptors.11 central nervous ␣2-adrenergic receptors also regulate parasympathetic activity,25,26 which could also contribute to sibutramine’s cardiovascular effect.
the combined action of sibutramine in the brain and
in peripheral tissues was associated with a significant
change in baroreflex regulation. the responsiveness to
vasoactive medications strongly depends on the ability
of the baroreflex to counteract changes in vascular tone,
a so-called baroreflex blood pressure buffering.27 the

increased phenylephrine sensitivity with sibutramine
could be mediated in part through impairment in
baroreflex blood pressure buffering. msna failed to
increase properly during nitroprusside infusions and
could not be further suppressed during phenylephrine
infusion. thus the ability of the baroreflex to adjust
vascular tone may be limited. baroreflex heart rate

regulation was better maintained during sibutramine
treatment. similar changes in baroreflex heart rate and
sympathetic baroreflex regulation have been demonstrated for the selective  xxxg2148xxx  inhibitor  xxxd3089xxx .15 a maintained baroreflex heart rate
control, coupled with impaired sympathetic vasomotor
regulation, may contribute to the orthostatic heart rate
increases observed with sibutramine.13
our baroreflex studies suggest that the combination
of a central sympatholytic effect with a stimulatory
peripheral effect of sibutramine results in redistribution
of sympathetic activity from the vasculature toward the
heart. indeed, heart rate responses, particularly during
orthostatic stress, are increased with sibutramine and
other  xxxg2148xxx  inhibitors.13,14,23 in
contrast, sympathetic vasomotor tone is decreased.12,15
similarly, a study using the norepinephrine spillover
technique showed that nonselective norepinephrine
transporter inhibition causes disproportionate sympathetic stimulation of the heart, as compared with the
vasculature or the kidney.12 in susceptible individuals
the redistribution of sympathetic activity toward the
heart may raise blood pressure through ␤-adrenergic
receptor stimulation.13,28
a limitation of our study is that we tested the effect
of sibutramine solely after short-term treatment. sibutramine’s effects on sympathetic regulation in the
long-term treatment of obese patients may differ from
its more short-term effects. the treatment duration is
one possible explanation for a difference in blood pressure responses between our study and previous studies.8,23 in the clinical setting most patients will lose
body weight with sibutramine treatment. body weight
reduction is known to decrease sympathetic activity and
blood pressure.29,30 thus not only sibutramine alone
but also the associated weight loss may influence sympathetic activity. the interaction of these variables
should be assessed in long-term studies. another potential limitation is that the interpretation of our results

clinical pharmacology & therapeutics
2006;79(5):500-8

relies in part on animal data. we cannot exclude interspecies differences in the contribution of norepinephrine transporters to autonomic cardiovascular regulation.
nevertheless, we believe that our study provides
important insight into the cardiovascular autonomic
profile of sibutramine. in obese patients resting blood
pressure tends to increase slightly with sibutramine,8,23
whereas blood pressure during sympathetic stimulation
is decreased.13 the microneurography data suggest that
these paradoxical changes are probably explained by a
combination of a peripheral stimulatory effect and a
central nervous inhibitory effect of sibutramine on the
sympathetic nervous system. the balance between peripheral and central changes in sympathetic activity
and, thus, the net blood pressure response may differ
between patient populations.
