abstract:  xxxd1698xxx  was developed as a selective inhibitor of  xxxg1696xxx  3 ( xxxg1695xxx ). the antiplatelet and vasodilator properties of  xxxd1698xxx  have been extensively characterized and considered to contribute to the
variety of clinical effects such as intermittent claudication and recurrent stroke. in this review, the novel action
mechanism (s) of  xxxd1698xxx  are overviewed with the focus on the action of  xxxd1698xxx  in in vitro and in vivo studies as a
maxi-k channel opener targeting anti-apoptotic signaling pathways. under treatment with  xxxd1698xxx  (10 mg/kg
intravenously or 30 mg/kg orally), a significant reduction in cerebral infarct area was evident in rats subjected to
ischemia/reperfusion. increase in  xxxd1773xxx  and decrease in tnf-alpha levels were identified in the ipsilateral cortex under
treatment with  xxxd1698xxx  accompanied by decreased bax formation and  xxxg569xxx  release with increased bcl-2
production in the penumbral area as well as in the in vitro human umbilical endothelial cells.  xxxd1698xxx  suppressed  xxxg2296xxx -induced decrease in viability of sk-n-sh (human neuroblastoma) cells and hcn-1a (human cortical neuron) cells in
association with decrease in pten phosphorylation and increase in akt/creb phosphorylation with suppression of dna
fragmentation, all of which were antagonized by iberiotoxin, a maxi-k+ channel blocker. further,  xxxd1698xxx  prevented
tnf-alpha-induced pten phosphorylation and apoptotic cell death via increased  xxxd1409xxx  phosphorylation in the sk-n-sh cells.
 xxxd1698xxx  increased k + current in sk-n-sh cells by opening the maxi-k channels. thus, it was suggested that the action
of  xxxd1698xxx  to promote cell survival was ascribed to the maxi-k channel opening-coupled upregulation of  xxxd1409xxx 
phosphorylation and downregulation of pten phosphorylation with resultant increased phosphorylation of akt and
creb. these in vitro data were confirmed in the in vivo results of rats subjected to focal transient ischemic damage.

introduction
®

the pharmacology of  xxxd1698xxx  ( xxxd1698xxx  ) has shown a
wide spectrum of activity, thereby providing a variety of
clinical uses, including peripheral occlusive diseases and
intermittent claudication [1]. increasing evidence emerges
with efficacy in prevention of recurrent stroke [2] and
coronary restenosis [3] based on the experimental results of
anti-platelet, vasodilation, and antiproliferative actions.
under suppression of  xxxd1773xxx  degradation by
inhibition of  xxxg1695xxx  activity,  xxxd1773xxx  is increased in
platelets and blood vessels, leading to inhibition of platelet
aggregation and proliferation of vascular smooth muscle
cells [4]. primary strategies to minimize the acute ischemic
brain injury included anti-platelet agents, anti-coagulants,
and thrombolytics [5], since anti-platelet therapy modestly
improved the outcome in both acute stroke (with aspirin) and
in secondary stroke prevention (aspirin with or without
 xxxd1914xxx , an adenosine uptake inhibitor) [6]. secondary
prevention strategies have relied largely on the risk factor
reduction, carotid end-arterectomy, anti-coagulation for
cardioembolic strokes, and anti-platelet agents for atherothrombotic strokes [7].  xxxd1698xxx  significantly inhibited the
occlusive thrombus formation in a porcine model, which was
considered due to its anti-platelet effect [8]. kohda et al. [9]

have suggested the usefulness of  xxxd1698xxx  for treatment or
prevention of cerebral ischemic events caused by thrombus
formation in the carotid artery. by a multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind clinical trial,  xxxd1698xxx  treatment has achieved a considerable risk reduction in
patients with recurrent cerebral infarction [2].
tanaka et al. [10] evaluated the effects of  xxxd1698xxx  on
the pial vessels of adult cats subjected to endothelial damage
followed by middle cerebral artery occlusion. recently,
nakamura et al. [11] showed endothelium-dependent relaxation by  xxxd1698xxx  in the porcine thoracic aorta, in that
 xxxd1698xxx -induced relaxation of the thoracic aorta was
reversed by treatment with ng-nitro l-arginine (l-nna), a
competitive inhibitor of  xxxd2738xxx  (no) synthase, in
association with significantly increased no level in the porcine thoracic aorta, suggestive of implication of endothelium-dependent no production. aoki et al. [12] showed that
increase in vascular  xxxg1044xxx  by  xxxd1698xxx 
improved abnormal growth of vascular smooth muscle cells
and endothelial dysfunction through rapid regeneration of
endothelial cells. recently, oida et al . [13] noted  xxxd1698xxx 
effect to improve the vasodilator response of the brachial
artery to ischemia in ten male smokers.
recently, an increasing number of reports have been
published regarding the pharmacology of  xxxd1698xxx  to
suppress the ischemic brain damage induced by focal
transient ischemia/reperfusion. the present article summarizes the novel knowledges focusing on the neuroprotective
effect of  xxxd1698xxx  in in vitro and in vivo results most
recently published.

pharmacology in brain ischemia
recently,  xxxd1698xxx  has been tried for secondary prevention of stroke [2] with the result of benefit in prevention of
recurrent stroke. they reported that the mortality observed
during the on-treatment and follow-up period was decreased
with  xxxd1698xxx  (relative risk reduction, 42.3%). recently,
shinoda-tagawa et al. [16] have documented that, in an
open-label study of asymptomatic diabetic patients at risk for
first stroke,  xxxd1698xxx  prevents carotid intimal thickening,
and eliminates silent infarcts during a three-year follow-up
period.
recently, choi et al. [17] demonstrated a significant
reduction in cerebral infarct area in rats subjected to 2-hour
occlusion of the left middle cerebral artery (mca) followed
by 24-hour reperfusion by treatment with  xxxd1698xxx , in that
rats received 10 mg/kg  xxxd1698xxx  intravenously 5 min or 1
hour after the completion of 2-hour ischemia. they found
that  xxxd1773xxx  level was significantly elevated in the
cortex of 4- and 12-hour reperfusion under treatment with
 xxxd1698xxx , accompanied by decreased bax protein formation
and  xxxg569xxx  release from mitochondria, and increased
bcl-2 protein formation in the samples from the regions
corresponding to the penumbral area.
recently, magnetic resonance image (mri) technique
including apparent diffusion coefficient (adc)- and t2weighted images is increasingly used to evaluate various
treatment modalities as a powerful and non-invasive tool for
diagnosis of cerebral ischemia and for therapeutic approaches [18]. adc reduction in the early stage of cerebral
ischemia is ascribed to the formation of cytotoxic edema [19,
20]. an increase in intracellular volume fraction by cytotoxic
edema brings a reduction of the net adc value, where mri
sensitively detects the lesion areas [21]. lee et al. [22] have
monitored the adc and t2 images to confirm the inhibitory
effects of  xxxd1698xxx  on the hemispheric ischemic lesion, in

comparison with the histological findings at the terminal of
and after 24-hour reperfusion following 2-hour occlusion of
mca. they found that oral treatment with  xxxd1698xxx  30 mg/
kg two times at 5 min and 4 hours significantly suppressed
the hemispheric lesion area and volumes as detected by
adc, t2 images and histology with improvement of the
neurological deteriorations. thus, they speculated that
 xxxd1698xxx  treatment induced the recovery of adc and t2weighted images partly by restoring high-energy anaerobic
cellular processes by ameliorating disturbed ion homeostasis
and decreasing cytotoxic edema.
on the other hand, kim et al. [23] elucidated the in vitro
pharmacological inhibition by  xxxd1698xxx  and its metabolites,
opc-13015 and opc-13213, of the apoptotic cell death in
the human umbilical vein endothelial cells (huvecs)
evoked by lipopolysaccharide (lps). they noted that
 xxxd1698xxx  caused a significant suppression of cell death
induced by lps (1 µg/ml) in a concentration-dependent
manner, and  xxxd1698xxx  and its analogs strongly scavenged
the hydroxyl radicals with suppression of the intracellular
reactive oxygen species production, and moreover decreased
the elevated tnf-alpha formation. lps affects endothelial cells
indirectly by triggering the release of tnf-alpha and oxygen
free radicals from the cells [24, 25]. tnf-alpha-mediated
apoptosis is triggered via accumulation of reactive oxygen
intermediates [26]. takei et al. [27] have suggested that
increased  xxxd1773xxx  level suppresses the generation of
superoxide and  xxxd2298xxx . considering these
reports, the abilities of  xxxd1698xxx  to increase the  xxxd1773xxx 
production and to scavenge the oxygen radicals may
apparently elicit the synergistic effects in prevention of cell
death. this speculation was supported by the evidence that
the greatly increased bax protein expression and cytochrome
c release evoked by lps were suppressed by  xxxd1698xxx  [23].
increasing evidence has suggested a significant role for
bcl-2 in protecting neurons from ischemia-induced cell death
[28, 29] by preventing loss of the mitochondrial membrane
potential and release of  xxxg569xxx  to cytosol [30]. bax, as
a cell-death provoker protein, promotes apoptosis by
triggering the release of  xxxg569xxx  and activation of
caspase cascade [31] and its activity is neutralized by bcl-2
[32]. bcl-2 was originally identified as a human lymphoma
oncogene [33], and suggested to suppress the apoptotic cell
death and to promote cell survival after injury in a variety of
in vitro systems [34]. in the process of apoptosis, bcl-2 is
known to allow cells to adapt to an increased state of
oxidative stress, fortifying the cellular anti-oxidant defenses
and counteracting the radical overproduction imposed by
different cell death stimuli [35]. riccio et al. [36] and
pugazhenthi et al. [37] have addressed that enhanced creb
activity by akt signaling leads to increased bcl-2 promotor
activity and upregulation of bcl-2 expression, thereby promoting cell survival. on the other hand, bcl-2 acts to prevent
the generation of reactive oxygen species and reduction in
mitochondrial membrane potential under tnf-alpha [38]. the
facts that decreased bcl-2 and elevated bax protein expression under tnf-alpha were fully reversed by  xxxd1698xxx  [23] are
suggestive of the neuronal cell protective effect of  xxxd1698xxx .
nevertheless, it is inappropriate at present time to wholly
correlate the inhibitory effect of  xxxd1698xxx  on cell death with
the property to scavenge the reactive oxygen species.

 xxxd1698xxx  against focal cerebral ischemic damage

the signaling mechanism (s) by which  xxxd1698xxx  prevents neuronal cell death has been demonstrated by hong et
al. [39], in that  xxxd1698xxx  prevents tnf-alpha-induced decrease
in viability of sk-n-sh (human neuroblastoma) cells and
hcn-1a (human cortical neuron, [40]) cells in association
with suppression of dna fragmentation, all of which were
reversed by iberiotoxin, a maxi-k channel blocker (fig. 2).
tnf-alpha, a deleterious cytokine, mediates inflammatory,
thrombogenic, and vascular changes in association with
brain injury [41]. increased level of tnf-alpha in the brain
tissue after cerebral ischemia [42] is known to cause
neuronal cell death via induction of free radicals in glial cells
[43]. on the other hand, evidence has emerged that the
 xxxg1870xxx  deleted from chromosome
10 (pten) is implicated in the regulation of several cellular
functions, including cell viability from apoptosis [44, 45].
pten is capable of dephosphorylating both  xxxd1075xxx  and phospho-serine/threonine-containing substrates
[46], and also converting the phosphatidylinositol-3, 4, 5triphosphate [pi(3, 4, 5)p 3], a direct product of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase ( xxxg1743xxx -k) activity, to phosphatidylinositol 3,
4-diphosphate [pi(4, 5)p2] [45, 47]. inhibition of akt/creb
signaling pathway is implicated in the pten-induced
downregulation of bcl-2 protein in the neuronal cells [48].
the  xxxd1773xxx -response element binding protein (creb),
a 43-kda protein, is one of the important mediators of
neuronal survival in cerebral ischemia [49], and is implicated
in the transcriptional control of many genes. creb exerts an
important role in neuronal development, synaptic plasticity,
memory function, regeneration and cell survival in response
to various stimuli [50, 51].
it is noted that a signaling cascade mediated by
phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/akt/creb promotes cell
survival by growth factors against apoptotic stimuli by
regulating bcl-2 expression [52, 53]. overexpression of pi3k and its downstream effector akt ( xxxg1377xxx )
have been documented to mediate growth factor-induced
neuronal survival [54], and to upregulate bcl-2 promoter
activity in association with increased bcl-2 protein through

current pharmaceutical design, 2006, vol. 12, no. 5 567

enhanced creb activation [37]. in the light of these reports,
it can be inferred that inactivation of pten in neuronal cells
may provide the favorable signals for the cell survival by
inducing increases in phosphorylated creb and bcl-2
expression [55]. it was also shown that creb response
element site exists in promoter region of bcl-2 gene and
phosphorylation of creb causes an induction of bcl-2,
which prevents the striatal neurons from death evoked after a
transient occlusion of mca in rats [56]. recently, tanaka
[57] showed that, by double-immunostaining with antiphosphorylated creb and anti-bcl-2 anti-bodies, about 80%
of the phosphorylated creb-positive neurons co-expressed
bcl-2 in the ischemic area of brain. in the recent study,
immunohistochemical studies using anti-body against phosphorylated creb showed that the level of phosphorylated
creb was markedly low in the ischemic region corresponding to the penumbral zone when determined after 24hour occlusion of mca and 24-hours reperfusion consistent
with the previous report of tanaka et al. [56].
little information is known regarding the mechanism to
regulate the pten phosphorylation-linked akt activity in the
neuronal cell survival. hong et al. [39] demonstrated the
restoration of the decreased viability by  xxxd1698xxx , and they
observed that tnf-alpha-induced increase in pten phosphorylation and decrease in akt/creb phosphorylation were
significantly reversed by  xxxd1698xxx  with suppression of dna
fragmentation. the importance of pten phosphorylation
was supported by the study using u87-mg cells (pten-null
glioblastoma cell). whereas tnf-alpha did not suppress the
viability of the u87-mg cells, it did suppress that of u87mg cells transfected with expression vectors for sense
pten (spten), and the decreased viability was restored by
 xxxd1698xxx . the results showing that changes in creb/akt
phosphorylation levels showed a strong inverse correlation
with changes in pten phosphorylation in the u87-mg cells
of spten as well as in sk-n-sh and hcn-1a cells, when
plotted in the absence and presence of  xxxd1698xxx  have
highlighted the explanation that decreases in pten phosphorylation and activation of phosphorylation of akt/ creb

signaling pathways by  xxxd1698xxx  prevent neuronal cell death.
these results are well consistent with the report of huang et
al. [48] that transient transfection of pten into the ptennull cells results in decrease in bcl-2 mrna and protein, and
loss of pten leads to upregulation of the bcl-2 gene.
further,  xxxd1698xxx  was demonstrated to increase the k+
current in sk-n-sh cells by activating the maxi-k channels
without affecting the katp channels (fig. 3) [39]. although
they did not define the molecular mechanism how the  xxxg1259xxx  openers including  xxxd1698xxx  could decrease the
pten phosphorylation, they speculated that  xxxd1698xxx  might
have a potential in regulation of pten phosphorylation by
opening of the maxi-k+ channels. bms 204352 significantly
suppressed tnf-alpha (50 ng/ml)-stimulated pten phosphorylation as did  xxxd1698xxx . ns-1619 {1, 3-dihydro-1-[2hydroxy-5-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl]-5-(trifluoromethyl)-2hbenzimidazol-2-one} and bms 204352 {(3s)(+)-(5-chloro2-methoxyphenyl)-1, 3-dihydro-3-fluoro-6-(trifluoromethyl)2h-indole-2-one} are known as maxi-k channel openers.
the facts that these agents prevented increased dna fragmentation evoked by tnf-alpha and significantly suppressed
tnf-alpha (50 ng/ml)-stimulated pten phosphorylation, as did
 xxxd1698xxx , and all of actions were antagonized by iberiotoxin
[39] are suggestive of the potential implication of maxi-k
channel opening in the regulation of pten phosphorylation
related with dna fragmentation.

hong et al.

the hypothesis that  xxxd1698xxx  decrease the pten phosphorylation by opening the maxi-k channels was further
supported by the facts that suppressed pten phosphorylation and elevated phosphorylation of creb levels induced
by the maxi-k channel openers were reversed by paxilline (a
maxi-k channel blocker, mycotoxin naturally produced by
the fungus penicillium [58], as was by iberiotoxin (a peptidyl
scorpion toxin [59]). maxi-k channels are present in the
several brain regions, including the cortex and hippocampus
[60], and these channels are rapidly activated by depolarization and increase in intracellular calcium [61, 62].
as a downstream pathway, a correlation between reduction in ∆psim and initiation of the apoptosis in vivo was
demonstrated by zamzami et al. [63]. this interaction was
supported by zhu et al. [64], in that the reduction of mitochondrial transmembrane potential (∆psim) and intramitochondrial ca2+ concentration (cam) precedes activation of
caspase cascade and dna fragmentation, and overexpression of the bcl-2 leads to increase the cam load and ∆psim
and inhibition of apoptosis. considering these reports, the
findings that significant decreases in ∆psim and cam evoked by
tnf-alpha in the sk-n-sh cells were significantly reversed
under treatment with  xxxd1698xxx , and these  xxxd1698xxx  effects
were blocked by iberiotoxin (unpublished data) well
delineate the anti-apoptotic effect of  xxxd1698xxx . taken
together, it is summarized that  xxxd1698xxx  prevents tnf-alpha-

 xxxd1698xxx  against focal cerebral ischemic damage

induced cell death by suppression of pten phosphorylation
and activation of akt/creb phosphorylation via mediation
of the maxi-k channel opening.
kim et al. [65] have assessed that  xxxd1698xxx  inactivates
the tnf-alpha-induced pten phosphorylation and apoptotic
cell death via increasing the casein kinase 2 ( xxxd1409xxx )
phosphorylation in the sk-n-sh cells.  xxxd1409xxx , a ubiquitous
protein ser/thr kinase localized in the cell cytoplasm and
nucleus, exists as a heterotetramer consisting of alpha, alpha’, and beta
subunits, and has a potential role in multiple functional
activities including regulation of cell growth and proliferation.  xxxd1409xxx  catalyzes the phosphorylation of a large number of
proteins, and its phosphorylation modulates their activities
positively or negatively [66, 67]. ns-1619 and bms 204352
(maxi-k channel openers) significantly elevated  xxxd1409xxx 
activities that were reversible by iberiotoxin. sk-n-sh cells
treated with anti-sense  xxxd1409xxx  oligodeoxynucleotide showed a
prominent dna fragmentation with little responsiveness to
tnf-alpha in the phosphorylation of pten, indicative of
essential role of phosphorylated  xxxd1409xxx / xxxd1409xxx  in the cell
viability [65]. in the light of these facts, kim et al. [65] have

current pharmaceutical design, 2006, vol. 12, no. 5 569

concluded that the action of  xxxd1698xxx  promoting cell
survival is ascribed to the maxi-k channel opening-coupled
upregulation of  xxxd1409xxx  phosphorylation and downregulation of
pten phosphorylation with resultant increased phosphorylation of akt and creb.
further, lee et al. [68] have most recently confirmed the
signaling pathway in in vivo study by which  xxxd1698xxx 
suppresses the cerebral ischemic injury evoked by subjecting
rats to 2-hour occlusion of mca followed by 24-hour
reperfusion in association with decrease in blood brain
barrier permeability, leading to improvement of the neurological dysfunction. they found that  xxxd1698xxx  ameliorated the
neuronal damage by suppression of apoptotic cell death
(dna fragmentation) via the maxi-k channel openingcoupled upregulation of  xxxd1409xxx  phosphorylation and downregulation of phosphorylation of pten with resultant
increase in the akt and creb phosphorylation and bcl-2
protein production, all of which were antagonized by
iberiotoxin, a maxi-k channel blocker (administered intracisternally 30 min before ischemia) (fig. 4). the co-expression
of bcl-2 was demonstrated in the 80% of the phosphorylated

creb-positive neurons in the ischemic area of brain by
tanaka [57]. in the line of these results, decreased
phosphorylated creb level in the ischemic region following
mca occlusion was markedly elevated in the cilostazoltreated brain samples [67].
considering these in vitro results [31], the in vivo data
demonstrated by lee et al. [22, 68] indicate that increase in
 xxxd1409xxx  activity suppresses the pten phosphorylation level,
consequently leading to increase in the phosphorylation of
akt/creb (fig. 5). these are well consistent with the results
reported by guo et al. [69] and ruzzene et al. [70], in that
 xxxd1409xxx  counteracts apoptosis and apoptotic cell death. it
remains, however, unknown as to the molecular mechanism
how the maxi-k channel opening increases the  xxxd1409xxx 
phosphorylation. intriguingly, the blockade by iberiotoxin
was prominently evident in both  xxxd1698xxx -stimulated
phosphorylation of  xxxd1409xxx  and akt levels, and cilostazolsuppressed phosphorylation of pten. further study remains
to be clarified whether the maxi-k channel opening action of

hong et al.

 xxxd1698xxx  is attributed to the  xxxd1773xxx  protein kinase
activation by  xxxd1698xxx .
summary and conclusion
 xxxd1698xxx  has been approved to use in the united states
for reduction in intermittent claudication. as an inhibitor of
phosphodiesterase type iii which elevates intracellular cyclic
amp, it was introduced as a vasodilator and anti-platelet
aggregator.  xxxd1698xxx  treatment was demonstrated to reduce
the risk in patients with recurrent cerebral infarction.
recently,  xxxd1698xxx  significantly reduced cerebral infarct
size in rats subjected to 2-hour occlusion of the left mca
followed by 24-hour reperfusion, in that rats received 10
mg/kg  xxxd1698xxx  intravenously 5 min or 1 hour after the
completion of 2-hour ischemia. these were confirmed by
mri techniques.  xxxd1773xxx  level was significantly
elevated under treatment with  xxxd1698xxx  accompanied by
decreased bax formation and decreased  xxxg569xxx  release
from mitochondria, and by increased bcl-2 levels. further,

phosphorylation with resultant increase in the akt and creb phosphorylation and increased bcl-2 protein. p- xxxd1409xxx , phosphorylated  xxxd1409xxx ; ppten, phosphorylated pten; p-creb, phosphorylated creb; pi(4, 5)p2, phosphatidylinositol 4, 5-diphosphate; pi(3, 4, 5)p3, phosphatidylinositol-3, 4, 5-triphosphate; tradd, tnf receptor 1-associated death domain protein.

 xxxd1698xxx  caused a significant suppression of cell death
induced by lps (1 µg/ml), and  xxxd1698xxx  and its analogs
showed the property to scavenge the hydroxyl radicals with
suppression of the intracellular reactive oxygen species
production, and moreover decreased the elevated tnf-alpha
formation.  xxxd1698xxx  increased the k+ current in sk-n-sh
cells by activating the maxi-k channels. in in vitro study,
 xxxd1698xxx  prevented tnf-alpha-induced decrease in viability
with suppressed dna fragmentation of the sk-n-sh
(human neuroblastoma) cells, which were accompanied by
increased  xxxd1409xxx  phosphorylation-coupled decrease in pten
phosphorylation and increase in akt/creb phosphorylation
via opening of the maxi-k channels. in in vivo study,
 xxxd1698xxx  ameliorated the ischemic neuronal damage by
suppression of apoptotic cell death via the maxi-k channel
opening-coupled upregulation of  xxxd1409xxx  phosphorylation and
downregulation of phosphorylation of pten with resultant
increase in the akt and creb phosphorylation and bcl-2
protein production (fig. 6).
taken together, it is suggested that  xxxd1698xxx  has a
therapeutic potential in the brain injury induced by transient
focal cerebral ischemia.
