design, synthesis and crystallization of a novel glucagon analog as a therapeutic agent.  glucagon and  xxxg873xxx  (glp-1) are drugs or drug candidates for the treatment of metabolic diseases such as diabetes and obesity. the native hormones have pharmacological deficiencies such as short half-life and poor solubility. a novel  xxxg874xxx  agonist named glucagon-cex has been designed, synthesized and crystallized. this peptide was highly soluble under physiological conditions and crystallized readily. the crystal diffracted x-rays to 2.2 a resolution and the diffraction was consistent with space group p23, with unit-cell parameters a = b = c = 48.20 a, alpha = beta = gamma = 90.0 degrees. the crystals were suitable for a full structural determination to reveal the conformational differences between glucagon-cex and the native hormone.
