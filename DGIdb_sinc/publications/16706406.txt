we have presented a method for modeling polarization in hybrid qm/mm calculations. the method, which
expresses the induced dipoles as a set of “induced” charges, is based on the induced dipole approach and
methodology for calculating potential-derived point charges from distributed multipole series. the method
has the advantage that the same methodology can be used to determine the induced charges and the potential
derived charges and so both sets of charges are rigorously defined within the same framework. this underlying
link with the wave function makes the method particularly suitable for use in hybrid qm/mm calculations.
here we assess the importance of explicit polarization in the classical part of a qm/mm system with regard
to improving the classical description and the consequent effects on the quantum description. the main
advantages of the induced charge approach are that the method is readily interfaced with quantum mechanical
methods and that induced charges are more readily interpreted than induced dipoles. the ease of interpretation
is illustrated by analysis of the charges involved in dimeric and trimeric hydrogen bonded systems. the
method for treating the mm polarization has been validated by a regression analysis of the charges induced
in both the qm and mm systems against those derived from full quantum mechanical calculations. the
method has also been validated using two energy decomposition approaches, which show that mm polarization
makes a significant and reliable contribution to the qm - mm interaction energy in a hybrid system. the
distance dependency of the induced charges is investigated in calculations on methylsuccinyl-ala-ala-proala chlormethyl ketone interacting with human  xxxg694xxx  and propranolol interacting with asparagine
residues in a model of the  xxxg837xxx   xxxg1553xxx   xxxg2356xxx -adrenergic receptor.

introduction
hybrid quantum mechanics molecular mechanics (qm/mm)
methods1-3 offer much potential in modeling, particularly
because they offer a strategy for calculating the energetics of
an enzyme catalyzed reaction.4-18 they also offer a parameterfree approach for studying both the conformation and the
polarization of a quantum mechanical ligand within a classical
enzyme. in some cases, the polarization has been shown to play
a key part in priming substrates for reaction.9,19,20 such effects
cannot normally be observed with current molecular mechanics
force fields that are in widespread routine use (e.g., amber,21-24
opls,25-28 charmm29-31) as polarization is usually included
implicitly rather than explicitly. moreover, the advantages of
hybrid qm/mm methods are not restricted to enzyme reactions
but can also be applied to inorganic systems such as transition
metal complexes.32-34 here we describe a method for explicitly
including polarization in classical force fields that can be readily
interfaced with quantum mechanical methods. it is allied to the
method of deriving atomic charges (monopoles) from the
quantum mechanical electrostatic potential35 and is therefore
compatible with many of the force fields in current use.22,36 we
assess the importance of polarization of the classical part of a
qm/mm system both from the perspective of better representing

the classical part and from the perspective of its influence on
the quantum part.
stone has presented a rigorous theory for describing polarization37 that gives excellent results on small molecules38,39 but,
the method is not readily applicable to large biomolecular
systems. for such systems, the usual simplification is to assign
point charges, q, and isotropic scalar polarizabilities, r, to the
atoms; here, as elsewhere,40,41 we used the isotropic atomic
polarizabilities of miller and savchik.42 the field, e, due to
the point charges, q (and the induced dipoles, µ), then gives
rise to induced dipoles, µ, via

µ ) re

(1)

the induced dipoles, µ, modify the field, e, and so eq 1 is
usually solved by iteration, but considerable improvement in
accuracy can still be obtained without iteration43-45 and hence
with consequent savings in cpu time. the dipole, µ, and the
field, e, are shown in bold to denote that these are vector
quantities: this increase in complexity inevitably adds a high
computational overhead to the calculations and also makes them
more difficult to interpret. nevertheless, the method has been
applied to a number of systems, notably water.46-51 kollman
and hemmingsen have shown that polarization may be essential
for describing the hydration of cations.52,53 a number of authors
have shown that the polarization energy is particularly significant
in condensed phases and typically constitutes 10-20% of the
total interaction energies.43,54-59

the molecular electrostatic potential (mep)-derived charge method
fails on the buried zn atom.

approaches to polarization based on fluctuating charges, the
related chemical potential equalization model and the drude
oscillator model60-67 offer much potential for studying biomolecular systems because the polarization is handled at the point
charge level and so the computational overhead is small;63 work
for including these methods in hybrid qm/mm methods is
underway.68-70
we have followed an alternative approach to polarization.
previous methods for calculating potential-derived point
charges59,71,72 from a distributed multipole analysis (dma)73,74
are used to express the induced dipole, derived from eq 1, as a
set of “induced” charges on the atom carrying the isotropic
polarizability, r, and those bonded to it. the method has the
advantage that the same methodology is used to determine the
induced charges and the potential derived charges and so both
sets of charges are rigorously defined within the same framework. the link with the wave function is therefore retained and
this offers both compatibility with hybrid qm/mm methods and
the option to derive charges (and other parameters) unambiguously from the wave function. this point is important because
many force fields are parametrized against total energies without
a rigorous attempt to meaningfully separate the energy components. the method has been implemented in a fully classical
framework41 and an application of the method to the iodineoxygen nonbonded interaction in dimethyl-2-iodobenzoylphosphonate has been reported.40 here we present a more complete
report of the ability of the hybrid qm/mm method to reproduce
the electronic distributions in the classical and quantum components of a number of small hybrid qm/mm systems, and
introduce some of the issues that may be relevant for calculations
on large systems.
methods
the systems chosen consist of a number of dimeric or trimeric
nonbonded complexes that were sufficiently small to be studied
using full quantum mechanical calculations. the b3lyp density
functional method75 was used to determine the energies and
optimized geometries, primarily because charge distributions
derived from density functional wave functions do not include
polarization implicitly59 but also because the b3lyp method
can give a good description of hydrogen bonding,76,77 as long
as dispersion effects are not important.78 a relatively large tzvp
basis set of triple-zeta plus polarization quality designed for density
functional calculations79,80 was used because of its compatibility
with density functional calculations and because its large size
should help to minimize basis set superposition effects,81 which
were estimated using the counterpoise correction.82 (for the zinc
complex, [zn(h2o)6]2+ (table 1), a related dzvp basis set79,80
was used because the tzvp basis set is not available for zinc;
the dzvp basis set was also used for the large protease ligand).
symmetry was not rigorously applied, because it is rarely useful
in biology, and so some charges may differ slightly even though
they appear to be in identical environments. the charges were
determined using the mulfit methodology.59,71,72 these are

essentially potential derived charges in which the potential is
determined from a distributed multipole analysis up to hexadecapole in a spherical shell around the multipole center. the
optimal charges that reproduce this potential on the multipole
center and the atoms bonded to it are determined using an
analytical procedure that avoids the use of a numerical grid.
because the atomic charges are linked to the multipole expansion on the same atomic center (and those bonded to it), the
method does not suffer problems with ill-defined charges as
may occur with other implementations of the potential-derived
charge method.36,83-86 a catastrophic failure of the standard
potential-derived charge method is shown for [zn(h2o)6]2+ in
table 1. here the potential was calculated from the distributed
multipole expansion of the gaussian87 wave function using
orient88 at a surface of 955 randomly distributed points on
a surface at twice the van der waals radius. such failures depend
on the surface chosen and arise partly because atoms distant
from a center contribute toward the potential in its vicinity and
these failures are most noticeable for buried atoms such as the
zn in table 1: there are several such atoms in this study. we
note that the resp and related charge fitting procedures86,89,90
also avoid unrealistically high values for charges but require
extra constraints, unlike the methodology described here.
for each system in this study, one of the molecules was
described quantum mechanically and the remainder described
classically. the polarized wave function and the induced charges
on the classical atoms were calculated iteratively. first, the
monomer charges were assigned on the classical (mm) molecule
and these charges were used as a perturbation in the hamiltonian
to polarize the quantum mechanical (qm) entity.91-95 the
classical molecules were polarized via eq 1, with the electric
field at the mm atoms due to the qm entity potentially
calculated by one of two methods. the first is calculation of
the field directly from the wave function using gaussian.87
in the second, the wave function was calculated using gaussian and expressed as a distributed multipole analysis using
gdma 1.3.96 the field was then calculated from this multipole
series using orient 4.5.88 for both of these approaches, the
induced dipoles on the mm entity were calculated using eq 1
and expressed as induced charges using the mulfit technology
described above.40,41,59,71,72 both methods gave essentially
equivalent results but the second method was quicker and was
used for all the results reported here. the induced charges were
added to the monomer charges and the new charges replaced
the original charges as the perturbation to the hamiltonian. this
resulted in a new wave function, new fields and new induced
charges. the procedure was iterated (typically for 4 iterations)
until the value of the induced charges converged. as implemented here, the method does not readily permit the calculation
of analytical gradients, but this limitation has been removed in
a related method43 that uses an alternative approach for
converting induced dipoles into induced charges and is therefore
more suited to geometry optimization and molecular dynamics.
to avoid the “polarization catastrophe”, we followed the
procedure of not allowing atoms separated by 3 bonds or less
to polarize each other. a less obvious problem, which can be
corrected for, is the corruption of the monomer charges by the
polarizing effect of atoms in the same monomer unit.41 here
this was not a major problem and was ignored.
for the trimeric systems, two approaches to the polarization
were employed. in the first, only the field from the qm entity
was used in the calculations. in the second, the two mm entities
were also allowed to polarize each other; here the field at mm

entity 1 due to the qm entity was augmented by the classical
field (again calculated using orient) due to mm entity 2 (and
vice versa).
a simple energy decomposition scheme91,92 was applied to
the fully optimized complexes to determine the quantum
mechanical electrostatic and polarization energy so that the
energetic contribution of mm polarization to the polarization
of the qm entity within the hybrid system could be assessed.
let e1 be the quantum mechanical energy of the isolated
monomer and let its wave function be used as the guess for the
wave function in the hybrid qm/mm calculation. let e2 be
the energy at the end of the first scf cycle and e3 the energy
when the scf process has converged. the monomer charges
are then incremented by the induced charges and used in the
hamiltonian and e4 is the energy at the end of the scf process
when this wave function has converged (i.e., after the first
iteration). e5 is the corresponding energy at the end of the scf
process after 4 iterations. under these circumstances, e2 - e1
is the electrostatic energy and e3 - e2 is the scf polarization
energy. taken with the self-energy correction (see below),
e4 - e3 gives the mm polarization energy after 1 iteration and
e5 - e4 gives the additional mm polarization energy after the
iteration has converged (i.e. after 4 cycles). in all cases, iteration
refers to iteration of the induced charges and not to scf cycles.
the self-energy, eself, is the energy required to create the
induced charges. ferenczy and reynolds43 give two alternative
ways for calculating this correction within a purely classical
framework.

the charges did not include the classical correction (as is apparent from
the disparity at some positions between (iii) and (iv)) and were obtained
after one iteration.

(2b)

here the more common method of calculating eself from the
electric field, ei, and polarizabilities, ri at the mm atoms i,
(2b), overestimates the correction as it assumes isotropic
polarization and so here we used the qm/mm analogue of eq
(2a) which, as in equations (2a) and (2b), gives the mm
polarization energy as half the total polarization energy calculated in the absence of the self-energy calculation.
morokuma energy decomposition analysis,97 implemented at
the hartree-fock level within gamess-us98 was used to
determine the polarization component of the total quantum
mechanical interaction energy. this program partitions the
energy into an electrostatic, polarization, charge-transfer, exchange repulsion and a contribution (termed “mix”) that cannot
be assigned to any of the other categories. the “mix” term was
added to the counterpoise correction to give an upper limit to
the error in the polarization component. the morokuma energy
decomposition analysis does not give a unique partitioning but
it does provide a useful independent benchmark against which
the qm/mm calculations can be assessed. for this reason, some
of the qm/mm calculations were also performed at the
hartree-fock level using the same tzvp basis set, or the
6-31g* basis set99 for the propranolol- xxxg837xxx   xxxg1553xxx   xxxg2356xxx -adrenergic receptor
system, because this basis set or a similar one is usually used
for such applications in biology).
the statistical analysis was performed using spss 11.5;100
in all determinations of f and t the probability that the results
arose by chance was given as 0.000 and so is not reported below.

results and discussion
qualitative analysis of the induced charges. the results
are readily illustrated by calculations on water dimers and
trimers, as shown in figure 1. the anticooperative water trimer
(1b) shows the least increase in polarity, followed by the dimer
(1a), the linear cooperative trimer (1d) and last the cyclic water
trimer (1c). the results for the full set of the additional molecules
(figure 2 plus the a-t and a-u base pairs) are given in figures
s1-5s. these charges are the simplest that can be calculated
under the schemes presented here as they were calculated after
1 iteration and did not include the classical correction to the
field. the systems studied here interact through hydrogen bonds
and so the qualitative power of the method can be seen by
analyzing the charges on the oxygen and nitrogen atoms that
(a) donate hydrogen bonds (table 2), (b) receive hydrogen bonds
(table 3) and (c) donate and receive hydrogen bonds (table
4). table 5 shows that the charges usually converged after 3
cycles of iteration, particularly for atoms not involved in
hydrogen bonding. indeed, the rapid convergence for many
atoms suggests strategies for reducing the computational effort
that will be investigated further below. initially, however, in
tables 2-4, we concentrate on the charges determined after
full iteration with the classical correction to the field.
some of the systems presented below display quite subtle
effects that arise because of the interplay between different
hydrogen bonds. for example, in the water trimer in figure 1b,
the outer water molecules polarize the central molecule via the
same oxygen atom. vectors drawn from the central oxygen to
the hydrogen-bonding hydrogen atoms of the flanking water

for the trimer systems, the induced charge calculations incorporated
the classical correction. the charges reported are those obtained after
four cycles of iteration but are generally the same at 2dp as those
obtained after 1 iteration. for the trimer systems, as there are three
ways to select the monomer to be treated quantum mechanically, it is
possible to report two induced charges for each atom, one for each
qm monomer. however, with the classical correction (but not without),
these values are largely the same at 2dp and so the common value is
reported in tables 2-4. however, in a few cases where there are
multiple equivalent values, e.g., fww, a consensus is reported (but in
table 6 all values are used).

molecules are essentially opposed to each other. in some
respects, therefore, the hydrogen bonds are working against each
other and the hydrogen bond system is termed anticooperative.
in contrast, in (1d), the corresponding oxygen to hydrogen
vectors point in the same direction. in this system, (1d), the
hydrogen bonds re-enforce each other and the hydrogen bond
system is cooperative. these effects are magnified in the cyclic
cooperative systems in figures 1c and 2e. similar effects work
to re-enforce the two a-t and a-u hydrogen bonds in the base
pairs (figure s5, supporting information).

charges), followed by the dimer and then the cooperative trimer.
this effect is well reproduced by the induced charges. a similar
increase in polarity in the methanol trimer over the dimer is
again well reproduced. the ability of formaldehyde to polarize
a water molecule is generally less than that of another water
molecule and this is reflected well in the changes in the induced
charges. the change in polarity in the anticooperative formaldehyde water heterotrimer compared to the dimer is minimal
because the polarizing power of the formaldehyde is split
between the two water molecules. for the base pairs, the increase
of ∼-0.05 in charge on n6 and n3 of a and t (or u) is well
reproduced.
hydrogen bond accepting heavy atoms. the induced
charges on the hydrogen bond accepting oxygen and nitrogen
atoms given in table 3 generally increase in line with the
quantum mechanical charges. the increased polarity in the water
and methanol trimers over the water and methanol dimers
(respectively) is well reproduced as is the increase in polarity
for the water formaldehyde heterotrimer over the corresponding
dimer. there is a greater tendency to overestimate the charges
in hydrogen bond accepting oxygen atoms compared to the
hydrogen bond donating oxygen atoms; this is partly due to
the inherent deficiencies of the point charge approximation and
partly due to the method of distributing an induced dipole over
neighboring centers. however, the comparatively larger increase
in polarity of o4 in u and t is well reproduced.

hydrogen bond donating and accepting heavy atoms.
the increase in the charge on the atoms in table 4 that accept
as well as donate hydrogen bonds is greater than their
counterparts in tables 2 and 3, and this increase is reproduced
well by the induced charges. the polarization effects in the
cyclic systems appear to be more additive than in the acyclic
systems according to the qm calculations but not according to
the qm/mm calculations. however, the greater polarity in the
cyclic systems may be supplemented by greater basis set
superposition effectssthe counterpoise correction is certainly
larger for the cyclic systems (3.8 kj mol-1 compared to 3.2 kj
mol-1 for the cooperative water trimer and 5.0 kj mol-1
compared to 3.9 kj mol-1 for the cooperative methanol trimer).
under these circumstances there is probably some uncertainty
in the benchmark quantum calculations (despite the use of a
large basis set to minimize the basis set superposition error).
nevertheless, the general conclusion to emerge from tables 2-4
is that the induced charge method gives a good qualitative
reproduction of the charge distribution in the mm part of the
systems presented in figures s1-s5.
importance of the classical correction to the field. figure
3 shows qualitatively why it is advantageous to include the
classical correction to the field for certain configurations. here
a classical formaldehyde accepts a hydrogen bond from the
quantum water (and the classical water). though the classical
water does not donate a traditional hydrogen bond to the
quantum water as the distance is too great, it still presents a
hydrogen toward the quantum hydrogen. the polarizing effects
of the quantum water minimize this mildly repulsive h‚‚‚h
interaction by reducing the charge on the classical hydrogen
from 0.38 to 0.37 (third row in figure 3); there is an anomalous
decrease in the polarity of the oxygen atom (to -0.75) and an
increase in polarity from 0.37 to 0.38 for the other hydrogen.
in reality, the hydrogen bond with the classical formaldehyde
should result in increased polarity. this effect can be incorporated via the classical correction to the field and here this results
in an increase in charge on the hydrogen from 0.38 to 0.41
(fourth row in figure 3), which agrees with the full quantum
mechanical calculations. for this reason, all of the results in
tables 2-4 included the classical correction.

the simplest approximation is the monomer charges. where x is
the quantum charges in qm/mm systems, they are denoted qm/mm,
whereas the induced charges are denoted qm/mm. the classical
correction (“class. corr”) to the field is defined in the methods section.
the number of compounds and the number of iterations of the induced
charges (“it. no.”) is also given.

effect of the induced charges on the qm system. the
effect of classical polarization in the mm entity on the atomic
charges that can be calculated for the qm entity using mulfit is
less marked as they are already polarized through the scf
process and so the additional polarization is small. in figure 3
there is no effect visible at 2d.p. in the charge on the quantum
oxygen atom, and a small increase of 0.1 in the charge of the
quantum hydrogen that donates a hydrogen bond (regardless
of whether the classical correction is included or omitted). the
effect of mm polarization in improving the qm atomic charges
can be detected by regression analysis of the charges, as shown
in table 6, but the effect on the energetics of interaction is more
noticeable because this involves both the qm and mm atoms.
regression analysis of the induced and quantum charges.
using atomic charges from the full qm calculations as a
benchmark, regression analysis has been used to assess whether
mm polarization improved charges on the key atoms involved
in the trimer interactions, as discussed above, for both the qm
entity and the mm entity. for the acyclic water trimers, these
key atoms are the central ohoho atoms that form the linear
h-bond arrangement; for the cyclic trimers the key atoms are
the ring of 3 oh groups. carbonyl carbons are also included
as key atoms. the results are given in table 6. trimer formation
results in polarization of the monomers, and this is reflected in
the regression coefficient, m, taking a value greater than 1.0s
the value of ∼1.1 (row 1, table 6) suggests an increase in
polarity of ∼10%. the qm/mm charges in the qm entity
correlate much better with the qm charges: the coefficient drops
from ∼1.1 to ∼1.01 (row 2), which is much nearer the ideal
value of 1.0, even without mm polarization. one iteration of
polarization of the mm charges takes m to a value of 0.997
(row 3), which is even closer to the ideal value but subsequent
iteration does not result in more improvement of the qm charges
(row 4). if the classical correction is applied to the polarized
mm charges, m for the qm charges drops marginally to 0.994
(row 5, 1 iteration) but the f value increases. subsequent
iteration (row 6) improves f and t marginally but also reduces
m marginally.
similar improvements are seen in the mm charges. one
iteration in the absence of the classical correction sees m drop
from ∼1.1 (row 1, monomer charges) to ∼1.02 (rows 7 and 8),
which again is nearer to the ideal value of 1.0. application of
the classical correction sees m drop from ∼1.1 to 0.98 (row 9),
giving a similar improvement in m, but this is accompanied by
a more notable increase in f and t. the results after one iteration

(row 9) are superior to those after 4 iterations (row 10).
however, it should be noted that although the visual analysis
in tables 2-4 and the regression analysis in table 6 provides
evidence that the atomic charges are polarizing in a meaningful
way, perfect agreement with the quantum mechanical charges
cannot be expected for two reasons. first, it is well-known that
atomic charges are not rigorously defined within quantum
mechanics. second, the partitioning of an induced dipole at an
atomic center onto the neighboring centers inevitably means
that the regression cannot be perfect, and this is the reason m
tends to move further away from 1.0 on subsequent iteration.
for this reason, the true test of the method is not how well it
reproduces changes in the atomic charges, though this can be
useful for gaining chemical insight, but how well it reproduces
the energetics.
electrostatic and polarization energies. the atomic charges
determined by the full qm calculations can be taken to represent
the “definitive” result that would occur if the polarization
process worked perfectly. clearly the phrase “definitive” needs
to be used with caution, as basis set superposition effects are
not zero despite the use of a large basis set, but is clearly
reasonable to set these calculations as the benchmark for qm/
mm calculations performed with the same functional. the
b3lyp electrostatic and polarization energies resulting from
this process are compared to those determined with no mm
polarization and those determined using mm polarization, with
and without iteration for the dimeric systems in figure 4. despite
the inherent polarity of hartree-fock wave functions, table 7
shows that the regression analysis for the b3lyp energies in
figure 4 and the corresponding hartree-fock energies (not
shown) are essentially identical. here we merely note that the
marked polarity of hartree-fock wave functions with small
basis sets is much less marked for large basis sets and this is
probably the origin of this equivalence. for this reason, the
corresponding hartree-fock results for the trimer systems with
and without the classical correction are shown in figure 5. the
results in figures 4 and 5 and table 7 clearly show that the
qm/mm electrostatic and polarization energies with no mm
polarization underestimate the “definitive” energies by about
9-12% (as judged by the slope of the best-fit lines, which is
∼1.105). with mm polarization and four cycles of iteration,
the dimer electrostatic and polarization interaction energy is
overestimated by about 2.3%, or 1.6% with just one iteration
(the slopes are ∼0.977 and 0.984, respectively). the results for
1 iteration are not shown in figure 5 as the line is too close to
the line for 4 iterations. because the results with and without
iteration are essentially equivalent, there is little to be gained
by iteration and indeed the results without iteration are actually
slightly superior as well as taking just 40% of the time. for the
trimer systems without the classical correction, the interaction
energy is underestimated by about 2.9%, but with the classical
correction the error decreases to a slight 0.8% overestimate. in
contrast to the qm/mm interaction energies without mm

polarization, all four mm polarization schemes in figures 4 and
5 give rise to correlations that lie close to the 45° degree ideal
line. it would seem reasonable to conclude that only one iteration
is required and that the classical correction is desirable but not
essential. indeed, in a similar implementation of this approach
designed for molecular dynamics simulations,43 we note the
liquid water oxygen-oxygen radial distribution function was
well-reproduced without iteration.

that emerge from these calculations can be seen by analyzing

well within the error bars. second, there is a difference between

induced dipoles for both a and b. error is the sum of the mix term
and the counterpoise correction and is used to set the error bars on the
polarization energy calculated using morokuma energy decomposition
analysis.

the qm entity. third, the combined qm polarization energies
inevitably underestimate the effect, because in the qm/mm
calculation of e3, the mm part is not at all polarized and so the

qm part is also not fully polarized. for the same reason, the
combined mm polarization energies slightly overestimate the
effect. the induced dipole approximation greatly overestimates
the effect, but unlike the overestimation in the combined mm
polarization energies, this is not due to an arbitrary partitioning.
in a previous article on induced charges, we regarded the
induced dipole approximation as a superior model and assessed
the induced charge model by how well it reproduced the induced
dipole polarization energies.43 generally, the induced charge
model reproduced a fraction of the polarization energy, which
in most orientations was adequate but was low for a water dimer
where the second water approached from a direction perpendicular to the hoh plane (as in figure 7c). figures 6 and s6
suggests that the induced charge model may actually be superior
to the induced dipole model, which does not always agree to
within the error bars of the morokuma energy decomposition
analysis. the induced dipole model is inherently isotropic
whereas the induced charge model is inherently anisotropic as
it is constrained by the molecular structure.
for the water dimer of figure 1 (ww), the classical water
model cannot polarize perpendicular to the plane. we therefore
see superior results in the planar wwpl system (figure 7b)
where this deficiency is artificially removed. in cases such as
wwpp (figure 7c) where there should be significant polarization
perpendicular to the plane, figure 6 (second  xxxg92xxx ) shows that
this anisotropic model underestimates the polarization energy.
however, the isotropic model (sixth  xxxg92xxx ) overestimates the
polarization by a greater amount and so is in greater error.
indeed, the anisotropic induced charge model is superior to the
isotropic induced dipole model in all the systems represented
in figures 6 and s6.
the problem of polarization perpendicular to the plane can
be addressed using point charges sited 0.1 å above and below

the closest distance of approach, r, between key atoms is also given along with the identity of these residues, which can also be found by
reference to figure 8. “elec” is the electrostatic interaction energy (e2 - e1), “scf pol” is the polarization energy due to the scf process (e3 e2), “mm pol” is the polarization energy due to the induced charges from (e4 - e3) or (e5 - e4), and “total” is the sum of the scf and mm
polarization energies. the classical correction to the field was not applied.

the plane, as shown in figure 6 (wwppq). however, the
polarization energy is overestimated and the resulting induced
charges (not shown) are nonphysical. we therefore conclude
that although the methodology permits such an approach, it
would require a degree of parametrization that is beyond the
scope of this article.
the polarization energy component of the energy relative to
the total electrostatic and polarization energy in figures 4 and
5 is 15 ( 3% for 1 iteration or 15 ( 4% for full iteration. this
percentage is remarkably close to the 14 ( 5% for the (different)
systems in figure 6. (the percentage relative to the total
quantum mechanical interaction energy is much higher (37 (
19%) because the exchange repulsion term is almost equal and
opposite in magnitude to the electrostatic term; the polarization
term is similar in magnitude to the charge-transfer term.) this
percentage drops to 6 ( 2% for the systems extended by 1 å
(figure s6) where the equilibrium bond length has been
extended by 1 å (and the percentage relative to the total energy
is similar at 6 ( 2% because the exchange-repulsion term is
reduced significantly in magnitude). consideration of these
values shows that although polarization is not the most important
term, its magnitude is sufficiently large to determine the outcome
of competing reactions with similar energetics. these calculations show that the scf polarization is less than half of the full
polarization energy, hence the need for mm polarization.
in summary, we conclude that when assessed against morokuma energy decomposition analysis, the qm/mm induced
charge model performs well.
contribution to protein-ligand interactions. to assess
the affect of geometry on the polarization calculations, we have
studied two systems of biological interest. the first is the 1.84
å structure of human  xxxg694xxx , a  xxxg745xxx 
interacting with the peptide analogue ligand methylsuccinylala-ala-pro-ala chlormethyl ketone. hydrogen atoms were
added and the system was minimized using moe. it therefore
represents an equilibrium system before attack on the ala p1
carbonyl group by ogamma of ser 195 (the key c-o distance is
3.24 å). the second system is propranolol (a beta-adrenergic
antagonist) interacting with a model of the  xxxg837xxx   xxxg1553xxx   xxxg2356xxx -adrenergic
receptor101 generated from a restrained molecular dynamics
study. the energy components for the pair wise interaction
between the quantum mechanical ligand and selected classical
residues are given in tables 8 (peptide ligand) and 9 (propranolol).
for the peptide inhibitor (figure 8, table 8), the polarization
energy can amount to 30% of the electrostatic energy (gly 193),
and for gly 218 is even greater in magnitude. in this configuration, the polarization energy significantly reduces the repulsive electrostatic interaction between ser 195 and the inhibitor.
in figures 4 and 5 the polarization energy contributed a much

more constant proportion (15 ( 4%) as the systems were all
hydrogen bonded. here the interactions are more heterogeneous
and the polarization ceases to be such a uniform proportion and
this is probably the main reason for including it.
a similar picture emerges in the propranolol- xxxg837xxx   xxxg1553xxx   xxxg2356xxx -adrenergic
receptor interaction (table 9, figure s7). here we see that the
electrostatic interaction energy can be positive (residues 264,
289, 293) or negative (residues 103, 183, 283), but the scf
procedure always lowers the energy; for residues 103 and 293
this lowering is insignificant because of the long distances
involved. for the close interactions, the polarization energy due
to the induced charges is generally of the same magnitude as
the scf polarization energy (e.g., for asn 264), but for asn
183, this lowering is greater (-1.1 compared to -0.1 kj mol-1).
in all cases apart from asn 283, the scf energy converged to
5 decimal places after just one iteration of the polarization

process; in all cases the energy had fully converged after just
two iterations. the results for residue 289 (as for ser 195 above)
are illuminating as they show a net gain in polarization energy
of -1.5 kj mol-1, showing that polarization can play a role in
helping to reduce repulsive interactions in protein-ligand
interactions, as well as further stabilizing attractive interactions.
the origin of the anomalous positive polarization energy for
asn 283 (mm pol ) 0.3) is similar to that for the anomalous
results for h2co‚2h2o (figures 2 and s2) when the classical
correction was not included and is reported to illustrate that
care must to be taken in partitioning the system.
here we have sought to gain additional insight into the
interactions within the  xxxg837xxx   xxxg1553xxx   xxxg2356xxx -adrenergic receptor-ligand complex
by applying the method at a geometry pre-computed using a
lower level of theory. such an approach is well established
within theoretical chemistry, as most elegantly illustrated in the
various variants of oniom,33,102-104 g1,105  xxxg2106xxx  and g3107
levels of theory. for more detailed applications involving
geometry optimization or molecular dynamics, the strategy
should be implemented with a variant of the mulfit approach
for which derivatives are readily calculated.43
conclusions
we have presented a method for modeling polarization and
have assessed its performance in hybrid qm/mm calculations
on a number of small molecule systems. the method is based
on the induced dipole approach (eq 1) but exploits existing
methodology for calculating potential-derived point charges59,72
from distributed multipole series74 to express the induced dipoles
as a set of “induced” charges on the atom carrying the isotropic
polarizability, r, and those bonded to it. the method has the
advantage that the same methodology is used to determine the
induced charges and the potential derived charges and so both
sets of charges are rigorously defined within the same framework. the link with the wave function is therefore retained and
this is the origin of the method’s distinct compatibility with
hybrid qm/mm methods. the advantage of the induced charge
approach is that the method is readily interfaced with quantum
mechanical methods and has the added advantage that the
induced charges are more readily interpreted than induced
dipoles.
regression analysis of the hybrid mm induced charges and
the hybrid qm charges against those derived from full quantum
mechanical calculations shows that the method works well. this
assessment has been supplemented by visual inspection: the
ease of interpretation is illustrated by analysis of the charges
involved in cooperative and anticooperative hydrogen bonding
systems. it is encouraging that polarization effects in water are
modeled well and this may be important, not only for modeling

water mediated protein-ligand interactions, as observed for
example in hiv protease and  xxxg631xxx , which
may require a hybrid qm/mm approach, but also for modeling
bulk water where it has been shown that standard water models
do not necessarily reproduce the asymmetric strength of
hydrogen bonds in bulk water.108
polarization effects generally contribute about 10% of the
total energy and so including polarization in the mm region of
a hybrid qm/mm calculation makes a significant contribution
to the total interaction energy. thus in the applications reported
here, the polarization energy is roughly twice that reported in
standard qm/mm calculations with fixed mm charge distributions. the “benchmark” polarization energy calculations show
that the use of well-chosen standard unmodified polarizabilities
gives good interaction energies.
for the small dimeric systems presented here, implementation
of the method is straightforward. for more complex systems,
consideration of geometric effects is important in setting up the
calculations as two contrasting effects are significant. though
the basic method involves iteration, the results, particularly those
involving interactions at nonequilibrium distances or interactions
to distant residues within a protein, show that in many cases
only one iteration is required. indeed, many interactions within
a protein could be ignored completely because the polarization
effects are so small. however, for certain trimers and other more
complex systems such as asn 283 in the receptor:ligand
complex, care needs to be taken in partitioning the system so
classical-classical polarization is included where necessary.
