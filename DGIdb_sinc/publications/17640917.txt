 xxxd226xxx  (ato) is an effective cancer therapeutic drug for
acute  xxxg1785xxx  and has potential anticancer activity
against a wide range of solid tumors. ato exerts its effect mainly
through elevated oxidative stress, but the exact molecular mechanism remains elusive. the thioredoxin (trx) system comprising
nadph,  xxxg1826xxx  (trxr), and trx and the glutathione
(gsh) system composed of nadph,  xxxg981xxx , and
gsh supported by  xxxg905xxx  are the two electron donor systems that control cellular proliferation, viability, and apoptosis.
recently, the selenocysteine-dependent trxr enzyme has emerged
as an important molecular target for anticancer drug development.
here, we have discovered that ato irreversibly inhibits mammalian trxr with an ic50 of 0.25 ␮m. both the n-terminal redox-active
dithiol and the c-terminal selenothiol-active site of reduced trxr
may participate in the reaction with ato. the inhibition of mcf-7
cell growth by ato was correlated with irreversible inactivation of
trxr, which subsequently led to trx oxidation. furthermore, the
inhibition of trxr by ato was attenuated by gsh, and gsh
depletion by  xxxd396xxx  enhanced ato-induced cell
death. these results strongly suggest that the ato anticancer
activity is by means of a trx system-mediated apoptosis. blocking
cancer cell dna replication and repair and induction of oxidative
stress by the inhibition of both trx and gsh systems are suggested
as cancer chemotherapeutic strategies.

gation with the active-site sequence -gly-cys-sec-gly-oh. the
selenocysteine (sec) (u) in the open c terminus is essential for the
reducing activity of trxr (20). selenol has a low pka (5.3) value,
and thus selenolate is the predominant form under physiological
conditions. this property and the accessible location of c-terminal
active site account for the wide substrate specificity of trxr (21).
the trx system, especially trxr, has been suggested as a new
target for anticancer drug development because trxr and trx are
overexpressed in many aggressive tumors, and the tumor cells
appear more dependent on a trx system perhaps for the constant
requirement of dna synthesis (22, 23). more recently, trxr
knockdown by a stable transfection with a small interfering rna
construct changed the mouse lung carcinoma cell morphology and
anchorage-independent growth property to be similar to those of
normal cells. furthermore, the tumor progression and metastasis
were dramatically reduced when these trxr knockdown cells were
injected into mice (24). these results strongly suggest that trxr is
essential for tumor cell growth in vivo. considering the extensive
involvement of sec-containing trxr in the redox regulations and
the close link with cancer (25), we have investigated the effect of
ato on trxr in vitro and in mcf-7 cells. ato exhibited excellent
inhibition of trxr and thus induced the trx-mediated cellular
redox changes in cells.

a

rsenic trioxide (ato) has been used as an anticancer drug for
several thousands of years in traditional medicine and recently
has been shown to be efficient in the treatment of the newly
diagnosed and relapsed acute  xxxg1785xxx  (1–4). more
interestingly, this anticancer efficiency of ato was extended to
many solid tumors (3). accumulating evidence suggests that protein
sulfhydryl (-sh) groups could be the main targets of the drug (5).
however, the exact mechanism of ato is still vague and incompletely understood. for example, it is known that glutathione
(gsh) is a predominant thiol molecule in the cell that plays a
critical role in the detoxification of arsenicals (6–9). the sensitivity
of cancer cell lines is inversely correlated with their gsh content
(6, 10). however, the arsenic cytotoxicity is not caused by the direct
inhibition of gsh-related enzymes, including glutathione peroxidase (gpx),  xxxg981xxx  (gr), and glutathione transferase (gst). the arsenic concentrations required to inhibit these
enzymes are much higher than the physiologically relevant concentrations (11). therefore, it is important to clarify the molecular
target to elucidate the cell death mechanism induced by ato.
the thioredoxin (trx) system, composed of  xxxg1826xxx  (trxr), trx, and nadph, is one of the main thiol-dependent
electron donor systems in the cell and plays critical roles in the
regulation of the cellular redox environment and a wide range of
cellular activities, such as cell viability and proliferation (12, 13).
mammalian cells have a homodimeric  xxxg2363xxx  in the cytosol/nucleus
(14, 15), trxr2 in mitochondria (16, 17), and tgr in the testis (18).
the three-dimensional crystal structure reveals that trxr is structurally similar to gr with the fad and nadph-binding domains
(19). besides the n-terminal -cys-val-asn-val-gly-cys-dithiol/
disulfide, mammalian trxrs contain a 16-residue c-terminal elon-

inhibition of trxr by ato in vitro. ato inhibited the activity of trxr

in a time- and concentration-dependent manner as shown by an
activity assay using direct reduction of 5 mm 5,5⬘-dithiobis(2nitrobenzoic acid) (dtnb) (fig. 1a). in the range of 0.05–5 ␮m
ato, the activity of 50 nm recombinant rat trxr decreased with
increasing ato concentration. when the ato concentration was
⬎1 ␮m, trxr activity decreased to a plateau value in 10 min,
whereas for ato concentrations ⬍1 ␮m, it took 20–30 min to
obtain a constant trxr activity. the calculated ic50 was ⬇0.25 ␮m
after a 30-min incubation. moreover, the whole trx system was
inhibited by ato with an ic50 value similar to that shown by an
insulin reduction assay (26). the presence of 2 ␮m human trx in
the incubation solution did not result in a big change of the
inhibitory efficiency, suggesting that ato attacked the trxr
specifically (data not shown).
the inhibition of mammalian trxr by ato was irreversible.
when a completely inhibited sample of trxr was passed through
a desalting sephadex g-25 column to remove the ato, no activity

was recovered in the eluted enzyme. this property is the same as
for the inhibition of trxr by other inhibitors such as flavonoids and
curcumin (27, 28). moreover, no increased nadph oxidase activity was induced for the inhibition of trxr by ato, and the
inhibition was not affected by the presence of superoxide dismutase
and catalase (data not shown).
the inhibition by ato depended on the redox state of trxr
because without the presence of nadph, trxr could not be
inhibited by ato (fig. 1b). in trxr both the n-terminal disulfide
and c-terminal active-site cys-sec are oxidized, and they are
reduced by nadph. however, nadph did not participate directly
in the reaction between trxr and ato because after removing the
coenzyme by a desalting column, the isolated reduced trxr with
free thiol and selenol groups was inhibited by ato (data not
shown). additionally, there is a remarkable difference between the
active sites of mammalian and bacterial trxr. both enzymes have
a redox-active disulfide plus nadph- and fad-binding domains,
but mammalian trxr possesses its active site in an elongation
containing a penultimate sec residue (29). ato (0–5 ␮m) exhibited no inhibitory effect on the escherichia coli trx system, indicating that the active site cys-sec, especially the sec is critical for
the inhibitory effect (fig. 1b).
in fact, the critical role of sec in the c-terminal active site for the
high affinity of arsenic with trxr was shown by the association of
trxr with phenylarsine oxide (pao)–sepharose, which has been
used to purify the recombinant trxr (30). the recombinantly
expressed rat enzyme from e. coli cell lysate with an enzymatic
specific activity of 15 units/mg protein is composed of nearly half of
full-length active trxr and half as a truncated trxr-inactive form
lu et al.

lacking the last two sec-gly amino acid residues. the active
full-length trxr with its c-terminal gcug motif is binding much
stronger than the truncated form with pao–sepharose, a resin
containing arsenic. full-length active trxr with a specific activity
of 35 units/mg protein is obtained after the pao–sepharose
purification (30).
to see the exact binding site of trxr with ato, particularly
whether the n-terminal disulfide or c-terminal active site reacts
with ato, we examined the trypsin-digested peptide mass of
trxr–ato with a matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass
spectrometry (maldi). compared with the control mass spectra
of trxr, a new mass peak at 1,234.6 appeared, which fit the
calculation value 1,234.3 of a c-terminal fragment sggdilqsgcug plus one asoh and minus two h (1,144.4 ⫹ 74.9 ⫹ 17.0 ⫺
2.0). this result suggests that arsenic binds with sulfur and selenium
in the motif gcug of trxr directly (fig. 1c). the mass fit
sggdilqsgcug alone was also observed in the ato-treated
sample; it may be because of the high reactivity of cys-sec, and part
of the c-terminal fragment loses its arsenic modification during the
measurement by a retro michael addition, which was observed in
the interaction between trxr with 4-hydroxynonenal (31). peptide
mass 1,501.7, which is assigned to oxidized  xxxg2296xxx 
w53glggtcvnvgcipk67, was observed in the control sample
without ato treatment but not in the ato-treated sample,
indicating that the n-terminal active site participates in the reaction
with ato. unfortunately, we did not get the mass that could
be assigned to the complex of the fragment w53glggtcvnvgcipk67 with ato (fig. 1c inset). as a control, an
adjacent peak 1,267.7, which is assigned to the peptide

l340eltpvaiqagr351, was present in both ato-treated and
untreated samples. it is known that the two subunits in dimeric
trxr have a head-to-tail arrangement, and the n-terminal redoxactive dithiol in one subunit and the c-terminal selenothiol-active
site of the adjacent subunit form a redox active center (19). thus,
the above results suggest that both the n-terminal and the cterminal active sites may react with ato coincidently.
inhibition of trxr in cells. human breast mcf-7 cancer cells, which

are sensitive to ato, were selected to investigate the effect of ato
on trxr (32, 33). the cell proliferation of mcf-7 cells that were
exposed to various concentrations of ato was determined by
2,3-bis(2-methoxy-4-nitro-5-sulfophenyl)-2h-tetrazolium-5carboxanilide (xtt) assay. the growth of mcf-7 was inhibited by
ato in a dose- and time-dependent manner. as illustrated in fig.
2a, 24-h treatment did not show any obvious effect on the cell
growth, whereas 48-h treatment by 2.5 and 5.0 ␮m ato resulted
in a significant reduction of cell growth. both trxr and trx activity
were measured in cell extract with an endpoint method and
represented by the percentage of enzyme activity of the lysates from
control cells without ato treatment. trxr activity was shown to be
inhibited by ato in a time- and dose-dependent manner with 2.5
and 5.0 ␮m ato, which induced a marked decrease in trxr
activity (fig. 2c), whereas trx activity did not show significant
changes with ato treatment even at the highest concentration
(fig. 2b).
trx redox state change induced by ato. although overall trx

content in the cell lysates appeared unaffected, as shown by
trxr-dependent insulin reduction assay, trx could be reversibly
inactivated by a change of its redox state because of the inhibition
of trxr, which is the only electron donor for trx. we used
iodoacetamide to alkylate free thiols under denaturing conditions,
and subsequently the alkylated samples were analyzed by running
a nonreducing sds/polyacrylamide gel to detect the trx redox state
by western blotting. in the control sample without ato treatment,
part of trx was observed in the monomer form, and some formed
oligomers or complexes with other proteins, but little was found in
dimeric or trimeric forms (fig. 3). treatment with 2.5 and 5.0 ␮m
ato for 48 h resulted in a decrease of the 12-kda monomer part
of trx, whereas the high molecular mass part of oligomer or
complex increased. we present direct evidence to show that trx can
exist in the form with mixed protein disulfides in vivo. this
protein–protein interaction by interdisulfide bond is distinct from
the noncovalent hydrophobic interaction between reduced e. coli
trx and t7 dna polymerase, the other well known trx–protein
interaction pattern (34). in the loading control for the sds/
polyacrylamide gel, the trx amount was shown to be equal in all of
the samples. this result showed that ato treatment induced loss
of trxr activity and subsequent dramatic oxidation of trx.
effect of glutathione on the inhibition of trxr. as shown in fig. 4a,

the in vitro trxr inhibition by 0.1 and 0.25 ␮m ato was attenuated
by 1 mm gsh, but at ⬎0.5 ␮m ato, trxr was inhibited in the
presence of gsh. consistent with these observations, a protective
role of gsh against ato was found in cell experiments. we used
 xxxd396xxx  (bso), an inhibitor of gsh synthesis, to
deplete the intracellular gsh pool. it has been reported that 80%
reduction of gsh in mcf-7 cells can be achieved by the treatment
of 25 ␮m bso without influence on cell viability (35). thus we
pretreated mcf-7 cells 25 ␮m bso for 24 h before the addition of
ato. the pretreatment with bso indeed dramatically increased
the sensitivity of mcf-7 cells to ato (fig. 4b).

of a selenoprotein such as trxr highly reactive, especially when it
is located in an open c-terminal active site. the unique property of
trxr to reduce trx makes this enzyme one of the predominant
regulators in redox control. recently, many of the frequently used
clinical electrophilic anticancer drugs such as cyclophosphamide
(37, 38), nitrosoureas, cisplatin (39),  xxxd1867xxx , doxorubicin (40),
motexafin gadolinium (41), and potential cancer chemoprevention
agents such as curcumin (28), or flavonoids quercetin and  xxxd2680xxx 
(27) have been shown to be excellent inhibitors of trxr, suggesting
that inhibition of trxr is probably a very common outcome in the
cancer chemotherapeutic process.
an overview of the two thiol redox systems in a cell is shown in
fig. 5.  xxxg1284xxx  of the trx system is a ubiquitous 12-kda protein with
a conserved -wcgpc- dithiol active site that reduces many critical
proteins such as ribonucleotide reductase (rnr), trx peroxidases
(prxs), and  xxxd2596xxx  reductases and thus participates in
dna synthesis and repair, or redox signaling by  xxxd2298xxx 
(26, 42–46). trx has also been reported to be involved in the
regulation of gene expression by mediating the activity of transcription factors such as nf-␬b, ap-1, p53 protein, and signaling
molecules such as apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (ask1) and
lu et al.

 xxxg1601xxx  by thiol redox control (47–49). therefore,
trxr inhibition will induce the subsequent oxidation of trx and
result in a great change of the activity of related proteins (fig. 3).
for example, many proteins, including ask1, have been reported
to bind only with reduced trx but not with oxidized trx. the
oxidation of trx induced by ato may activate ask1 and cause
ask-mediated cell death (50). this finding is also supported by the
observation that ask1 downstream kinase jnk was activated by
ato plus bso even in the presence of  xxxd68xxx  and
catalase (10). when mcf-7 cells were treated with 5 ␮m ato for
24 h, the cell viability was nearly not affected, whereas almost 50%
of trxr was inactivated. after 48 h of treatment, the viability was

fig. 3. trx redox state change in mcf-7 cells by the treatment of mcf-7.
mcf-7 cells were treated with different concentrations of ato for 48 h. the
ato-treated mcf-7 cells were lysed in guanidine lysis buffer containing 30
mm iodoacetamide so that protein sh groups were alkylated. then samples in
the presence or absence of dtt were separated on a 12% bistris gel with mes
running buffer, and trx was detected with goat anti-human trx antibodies.

decreased to 60%, and trxr activity was reduced by an additional
10% (fig. 2). the reason for this observation may be that the trx
system lies upstream in cell signaling pathways, and ato-induced
trxr inhibition occurs as an early cellular event followed by trx
oxidation and then leads to downstream apoptotic events. twentyfour-hour treatment with ato will also induce the change of redox
state of trx (data not shown).
the other central reducing multifunctional system is glutathione
system (nadph, gr, gsh) coupled with glutaredoxins (grxs),
gpxs, and  xxxg1073xxx  (fig. 5). gsh is the most abundant nonprotein
thiol in mammalian cells and plays a critical role in drug resistance
with its millimolar cellular concentration (51). gsh/grxs are
involved in the dna synthesis by providing an electron to rnr and
also in redox signal transduction and protein translocation by
controlling s-glutathionylation of proteins including  xxxg1893xxx , pka,
pkc, nf1, and nf-␬b, among others (43, 52, 53). gpxs are well
known for catalyzing the reduction of  xxxd2298xxx  and
 xxxd2298xxx  and thus protecting cells from oxidative
damage (54).  xxxg1073xxx  participate in the detoxification of electrophilic
xenobiotics by catalyzing the conjugation of gsh and regulation of
ask1, nf-␬b, etc. (55). as described above, gsh is the major
molecule to detoxify ato (fig. 4), but gsh-related enzymes are
not the target of ato; the activity of gsh-related enzymes
including gpx, gst, and gr was not reduced by ato treatment
in the cell (56). we also did not see a significant change for  xxxg905xxx 
redox state after a 48-h ato treatment with the method used here
for trx (data not shown). in contrast, in our in vitro study, in the
presence of 1 mm gsh (mimicking the intracellular gsh levels),
the trx system was inhibited by ato doses ⬎0.5 ␮m (fig. 4a).
furthermore, cell lysates of mcf-7 cells treated with ato showed
a reduction in trxr activity (figs. 2c and 3). these results
demonstrate that the trx system is a potential mechanistic target for
ato under physiological conditions.
many agents that can either reduce the content of gsh, such as
 xxxd228xxx  (6, 57) and  xxxd3417xxx  (58), or act through
a different mechanism, such as trolox (33, 59), enhance the
ato-induced apoptosis. among these agents, bso is the most
effective. the mechanism behind it can be well explained by our
result that trxr is strongly inhibited by ato. both the trx system
and gsh– xxxg905xxx  system may provide electrons to rnr, which is
essential for dna synthesis (43). moreover, dna repair activity
through ref1, p53, and rnr is also controlled by trx, and
inactivation of the trx system will abolish the dna repair process
(31, 60, 61). trx can provide the electrons to peroxiredoxin for
scavenging  xxxd2298xxx  (45), and moreover, trx reduces the
 xxxd2596xxx  reductases and thus is involved in the protein
repair from the oxidation of protein methionine residues (46). gsh
also participates in removing  xxxd2298xxx  by gpxs (54). the
two pathways act in concert to protect cells against oxidative stress.
the combination of ato and bso should result in the disruption
of the electron supply for dna synthesis and induce the elevated
oxidative stress and thus induce cells into apoptosis (fig. 5). these
effects should be the reason for h2o2 accumulation in cells upon
ato treatment (7).
arsenic has been normally treated as one of the most toxic and
carcinogenic agent (62–64). however, in the treatment of acute
 xxxg1785xxx , ato is known to be well tolerated, and
the adverse events are manageable (4). the treatment of ato plus
 xxxd228xxx  shows an acceptable toxicity in phase i clinical trial
(57). the combination of ato and bso significantly increased the
survival rate and decreased the side effects in an orthotopic mouse
model, and the cancer cells are more sensitive to the combination
treatment than normal cells (9), which may be because the cancer
cells require a constant dna precursor supply for their proliferation and also are more sensitive to oxidative stress (65–68).
in summary, we show here that the clinical anticancer agent ato
is a strong inhibitor of mammalian trxr with a mechanism
involving both the c-terminal and n-terminal redox active sites of

fig. 5. trx and gsh pathways interacting with ato. trx system including nadph, trxr, and trx coupled with peroxiredoxins and the gsh system composed
of nadph, gr, gsh coupled with grxs, gpxs,  xxxg1073xxx  are the two main electron donor systems that mediate the cellular activity including dna synthesis, protection
against oxidative stress, and thus control cellular proliferation, viability, and apoptosis. the combination inhibition of ato and bso will lead to the disruption
on both systems and block electron supply for dna synthesis and give a rise of oxidative stress and thus induce cells into apoptosis.

inactivation of whole trx system. our results link the mechanism of
anticancer activity of ato with the inhibition of trx system. the

different concentrations of ato, and incubation was conducted for
another 24 and 48 h. then the medium was changed to culture
medium containing xtt labeling mixture, and the incubation
continued for 3 h. xtt was metabolized to soluble formazan salt
by viable cells and yielded an a492 (roche, indianapolis, in). thus,
the cell proliferation and viability were determined by measuring
the a492.

activity assay for trxr and trx in the cell lysates. trxr and trx
activity assay was performed in 96-well plates with an endpoint
insulin assay (26, 69). for the measurement of trxr activity, ⬇25
␮g of cell lysate was mixed thoroughly with 50 ␮l of 55 mm hepes,
ph 7.6/0.2 mm insulin/0.4 mm nadph/2 mm edta/2 ␮m human
 xxxg1284xxx  in the versa microplate reader. the reaction solutions
without human  xxxg1284xxx  were used as the control. after the reaction
was performed at 37°c for 20 min, 200 ␮l of 1 mm dtnb in 6 m
guanidine hydrochloride solution was added to stop the reaction.
the free thiols of the reduced insulin were determined by dtnb
reduction, and the activity of trxr was represented by the a412,
where 1 mol of nadph reduced 1 mol of disulfide, giving rise to
2 mol of free tnb with the extinction coefficient 13.6 mm⫺1 䡠cm⫺1.
the trx activity assay was performed in 50 ␮l of reaction solution
containing 25 ␮g of cell lysate/55 mm hepes, ph 7.6/0.2 mm
insulin/0.4 mm nadph/2 mm edta/600 nm recombinant rat
