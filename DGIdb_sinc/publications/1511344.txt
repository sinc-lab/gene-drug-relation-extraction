ko' wonls: acetylcholine synthesis; acetylcholine release; af64a; cholinergic dysfunction; cholinergic toxicity

the activities of various prcsynaptic cholincrgic parameters were determined in hippocampal synaptosomes of rats 29 weeks after intracerehroventricular injection of ethylcholine aziridinium (af64a) (3 nmol/2 #l/side) or vehicle (saline), synaptosomes were preloaded with
[~h]choline (['~ll]ch). treated with diisopropyl  xxxd3217xxx  to inhibit cholinesterase activity and then were assayed for their content of
['~h]ch and ['~h]acetylcholine (['~h]ach) and for their ability to synthesize and release ['~h]ach, in synaptosomes from af64a-treated rats
compared with synaptosomcs from vehicle-treated rats we observed that: (i) specific uptake of ['~h]ch was reduced to 60% of control; (ii)
residing [~ttiach levels were 43% of control while residing ['~h]ch levels were 72% of control; (iii) basal and k ~-induced ['~h]ach release were
77~ and 73t:f of control, respectively: (iv) high k'-induced synthesis of [~h]ach was only 9% of control; (v) but,  xxxg440xxx 
activity remained relatively high, being 8()r~• of control, these results suggest tha! af64a.induced cholincrgic hypofunction is expressed by both
loss of some cholinergic neurons and impairment in the functioning of th~ spared neurons,

the cholinergic deficits in alzheimer's disease (ad),
characterizcd by reduced presynaptic cholinergic
nlarkers ~'~7,can be mimicked~ by the cholinotoxin-ethylcholine aziridinium ion (af64a)~, indeed, af64atreated rats are being used as an animal model for
ad '''~'~cl'~a. it has been shown that these rats incur a
significant reduction in a wide range of central cholinergic markers. yet, it is still not clear whether the
partial loss of markers is due to the loss of a population of cholinergic neurons or to an impairment in the
function of surviving neurons. knowledge on this subject may be relevant to the progression of cholinergic
deficiency that occur in ad patients and hence might
be relevant to the therapeutic strategies for ad.
the aim of the present study was to investigate
whether the cholinergic neurons that had survived
af64a-induced lesion might still retain all or some of
the attributes of normal cholinergic functions. for this
purpose, major parameters related to the. synthesis and
release of acetylcholine (ach) were followed in vehicle- and af64a-treated rats. a differential damage in

these parameters might indicate a specific and perhaps
irreversible dysfunction in surviving neurons. w~; found
that, unlike control, the synaptosomes from af64atreated rats had almost lost their ability to increase
ach synthesis in response to depolarization, in contradistinction, their ability to increase ach release was
similar to that of control.
af64a was freshly prepared before use as described by pittel el al. t~, diluted in saline, and administered intracerebrovemdcularly (i.c.v.) bilaterally at a
dose of 3 nmol/2 #l/side to 3-4 months old
sprague-dawley male rats (charles river, uk) as
previously described t-~. we chose the above-mentioned
dose of af64a since tl's dose has been shown to be
cholinos¢lective "~and yet with a significant long-lasting
effect on cholinergic parameters k~. control rats were
injected with saline which was used as a vehicle for the
injection of af64a. twenty-nine weeks after the injection, the hippocampus was dissected out and used for
the preparation of synaptosomes and homogenates.

(chat) activity, the hippocampus was immediately
frozen at - 7 0 ° c and homogenized (5% w/v) before
the assay in 75 mm phosphate buffer (ph 7.4) by
sonication. the assay was performed by incubating the
homogenates with [1-14c]acetyicoenzyme a (amer~bam; ~¢cific activity 5 mci/mmoi) as described by
fonnum -~ and modified by us 15. for the determination
of [3h]acetylcholine ([3h]ach) release and synthesis
and [3h-methyl]choline ([3h]ch) uptake, crude synaptosomal fractions were prepared from the hippocampi
according to the method of whittaker and barker tm
with the modifications described by pittel et ai. =4. the
p2 pellet was suspended (3-5 mg of protein/ml) and
assayed in a  xxxd2988xxx  containing: 125 mm
naci, 4.75 mm kci, 1.4 mm mgci 2, 2.0 mm caci 2, 20
mm hepes (ph 7.4) and i0 mm glucose. before the
assay the synaptosomes were treated with 10 -4 m
diisopropyl  xxxd3217xxx  for full inhibition of
acetyicholinesterase activity, preincubated with [3h]ch
(specific activity 80 ci/mmoi) for 30 rain at 370c, and
washed three times with the  xxxd2988xxx .
the levels of ['~h]ach and ['~h]ch were determined in
the washed ['ah]ch-preloaded synaptosomal suspension after a 15 rain incubation period at 37"c. this
method was described in detail by pittel et al. =3. the
separation of ['~h]ach and [3h]ch was carried out in
the medium and the solubilized pellet (in 20% triton
x-100) by the ch kinase-ion pair extraction method =~.
released ['ah]ach was determined in the supernatant
after centrifugation and separation from the pelleted
synaptosomes (non-released materials). ['~h]ach synthesis was determined by summing the level of released
and non-released ['ah]ach. when the effect of depolarization by high k + was studied, potassium and
sodium concentrations in the reaction mixture were 50
and 75 ram, respectively. depolarization-induced
['~h]ach release is defined as the difference between

similarly to our previous findings ~5, chat activity
was reduced to about 80% of control in the synaptosomes derived from rats 29 weeks following i,c.v, injection of af64a. similar reduction was observed in the
present study for [3h]ach release, these decreases
are most probably accounted for by a reduction in
cholinergic neuron population, the content of the total
labeled compounds within these synaptosomes was significantly reduced by 40% (fig. 1), however, when we
examined the distribution of the labeled compounds
within the synaptosomes, we found that ['~h]ach was
reduced disproportionately to that of [3h]ch; ['~h]ach
by 57% and [3h]ch only by 28% as compared to

control (fig. 1). these results suggest that in addition
to a loss of cholinergic neurons following treatment
with af64a, the surviving neurons might be impaired
in their ability to synthesize new ach. to further
ascertain this premise, the capability of the synaptosprees to synthesize new [3h]ach in response to depolarization by 50 mm k + was determined and compared
to the capability of the synaptosomes to synthesize new
[3h]ach without depolarization. studies with synaptosprees derived from the hippocampus of vehicle-treated
rats showed that depolarization with 50 mm k + enhanced the levels of newly synthesized [3h]ach in
comparison with non-depolarized synaptosomes. however, the capacity of increasing [3h]ach synthesis in
response to depolarization was almost completely lost
in synaptosomes from af64a-treated rats (fig. 2a).
however, the net effect of depolarization on [3h]ach
reloase, calculated as the difference between the k +evoked and the basal release, was not different in
synaptosomes from animal.~ treated with af64a and
control. thus, the same increase in [3h]ach release
induced by high k + in control synaptosomes was observed also in synaptosomes derived from af64atreated rats (fig. 2b). in summary, the hippocampal
synaptosomes prepared from rats 29 weeks after the
administration of af64a showed consistent but mod.
cst reductions in almost all cholinergic markers. no.
ticeably, these synaptosomes failed to replete the
['~h]ach stores, particularly after depolarization.
the present study reveals new details on the nature
of the cholinergic hypofunction induced by af64a.
first, as we observed earlier ~ and also in this study,
the cholinergic impairment induced by af64a is longlasting and can still be detected 29 weeks after the
injection of the cholinotoxin. however, our results in
this study indicate that the cholinergic impairment is
perhaps not only a reflection of a diminished number
of cholinergic neurons due to neuronal death, but also
a dysfunction of the spared remaining neurons, the
similarity in the reductions in chat activity, ['~h]ach
content and release, and ['~h]ch uptake are in agreement with the previously described cholinergic neuronal loss. in particular, the data on ['~h]ach release
substantiate this contention. thus, the ability to increase ['~h]ach release in response to depolarization
was preserved after af64a treatment to an extent
consistent with the ['~h]ach content of the synaptosprees. indeed, histochemical studies f'.x,'~a~, are consistent with our conclusion that a loss in cholinergic
neurons occurs in the brain of rats treated with af64a,
furthermore, our data also show that the surviving
neurons are incapable of increasing their capacity to
synthesize ach in response to nerve stimulation. these

neurons seem to fail to replete their store of ach at a
rate that would balance the loss of ach due to its
release. thus, in synaptosomes from af64a-treated
rats the depolarization-induced [3h]ach synthesis was
virtually absent. this finding suggests the presence of a
functional deficiency in the spared neurons. it is reflected in the inability of the cells to respond properly
to a situation that requires mobilization of a process or
processes critical in ach synthesis. at the same time
the release of [3h]ach from these same neurons seems
to proceed almost normally. the contention that the
ach-synthesizing capacity of the surviving neurons has
been impaired can also be deduced from the decrease
in their content of [3h]ach (43% of control) relative
to the decrease in their content of [3h]ch (72% of
control). we suggest that this deficiency may arise in a
process other than, or additional to, the one involving
the synthesizing enzyme, chat. this is because there
has been a reduction of only 20% in chat activity
while the reduction in residing [ah]ach was 57%.
in summary, the persistent cholinergic hypofunction
induced by af64a is currently interpreted as a decrease in the exposed neuronal population as well as a
permanent injury to surviving neurons, it is not known,
however, whether such injury is progressive in the
sense that it will eventually cause death of the injured
neurons, in the animal model for ad currently used,
further aggravation seems unlikely in view of the long
time lapse (29 weeks) since infliction of the lesion, the
relevance of our findings to ad is necessarily speculative. cholinergic impairment occurs also in ad patients and therefore may have similar consequences on
the remaining neurons. this may have a significant
implication on therapeutic strategies, thus, cholinergic
activity in ad patients may be enhanced by drugs
which increase ach release, but perhaps not by the
supply of the precursor for ach synthesis, another
possible implication is that the presynaptic approach in
ad management might be less promising than the
postsynaptic approach,
