increasing numbers of proteins, nucleic acids and
other molecular entities have been explored as therapeutic targets, hundreds of which are targets of
approved and clinical trial drugs. knowledge of
these targets and corresponding drugs, particularly
those in clinical uses and trials, is highly useful for
facilitating drug discovery. therapeutic target
database (ttd) has been developed to provide
information about therapeutic targets and corresponding drugs. in order to accommodate
increasing demand for comprehensive knowledge
about the primary targets of the approved, clinical
trial and experimental drugs, numerous improvements and updates have been made to ttd. these
updates include information about 348 successful,
292 clinical trial and 1254 research targets, 1514
approved, 1212 clinical trial and 2302 experimental
drugs linked to their primary targets (3382 small
molecule and 649 antisense drugs with available
structure and sequence), new ways to access data
by drug mode of action, recursive search of related
targets or drugs, similarity target and drug
searching, customized and whole data download,
standardized target id, and significant increase of
data (1894 targets, 560 diseases and 5028 drugs
compared with the 433 targets, 125 diseases and
809 drugs in the original release described in
previous paper). this database can be accessed at
http://bidd.nus.edu.sg/group/cjttd/ttd.asp.

eﬀorts have led to the discovery of hundreds of successful
targets (targeted by at least one approved drug) and
>1000 research targets (targeted by experimental drugs
only) (3–6). rapid advances in genomic, proteomic, structural, functional and systems studies of the known targets
and other disease proteins (7–13) enable the discovery of
drugs, multi-target agents, combination therapies and new
targets (3,5,7,14,15), analysis of on-target toxicity (16) and
pharmacogenetic responses (17) and development of discovery tools (18–21).
to facilitate the access of information about therapeutic
targets, publicly accessible databases such as drugbank
(22), potential drug target database (pdtd) (23) and
our own therapeutic target database (ttd) (24) have
been developed. these databases complement each other
to provide target and drug proﬁles. drugbank is an excellent source for comprehensive drug data with information
about drug actions and multiple targets (22). pdtd
contains active-sites as well as functional information for
potential targets with available 3d structures (23). ttd
provides information about the primary targets of
approved and experimental drugs (24).
while drugs typically modulate the activities of multiple
proteins (25) and up to 14 000 drug-targeted-proteins have
been reported (26), the reported number of primary
targets directly related to the therapeutic actions of
approved drugs is limited to 324 (6). information about
the primary targets of more comprehensive sets of
approved, clinical trial and experimental drugs is highly
useful for facilitating focused investigations and discovery
eﬀorts against the most relevant and proven targets
(5,7,14,16,17,20). therefore, we updated ttd by
signiﬁcantly expanding the target data to include 348 successful, 292 clinical trial and 1254 research targets, and
added drug data for 1514 approved, 1212 clinical trial
and 2302 experimental drugs linked to their primary
targets (3382 small molecule and 649 antisense drugs
with available structure and sequence, more structures
will be added).
we collected a slightly higher number of successful
targets than the reported number of 320 targets (6)

 xxxd788xxx  nucleic acids research, 2010, vol. 38, database issue

because of the identiﬁcation of protein subtypes as the
targets of some approved drugs and the inclusion of
multiple targets of approved multi-target drugs and nonprotein/nucleic acid targets of anti-infectious drugs (e.g.
bacterial cell wall and membrane components). clinical
trial drugs are based on reports since 2005 with the
majority since 2008. clinical trial phase is speciﬁed for
every clinical trial drug. we also added new features for
data access by drug mode of action, recursive search of
related target and drug entries, similarity search of targets
and drugs, customized and whole data download, and
standardized target id.
target and drug data collection and
access

target and drug similarity searching
target similarity searching (figure 2) is based on the
blast (27) algorithm to determine the similarity level
between the sequence of an input protein and the
sequence of each of the ttd target entries. the blast
program was downloaded from ncbi website
(http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast/download.shtml).
the similarity targets are ranked by e-value and blast
score (27). e-value has been reported to give reliable
predictions of the homologous relationships (30) and
e-value cutoﬀ of 0.001 can be used to ﬁnd 16% more
structural relationships in the scop database than when
using a standard sequence similarity with a 40% sequenceidentity threshold (31). the majority of protein pairs that
share 40–50% (or higher) sequence-identity diﬀer by <1 å
rms deviation (32,33), and a larger structural deviation
probably alters drug-binding properties.
drug similarity searching (figure 3) is based on the
tanimoto similarity searching method (28). an input
compound structure in mol or sdf format is converted
into a vector composed of molecular descriptors by
using our model software (34). molecular descriptors
are quantitative representations of structural and
physicochemical features of molecules, which have
been extensively used in deriving structure–activity
relationships, quantitative structure–activity relationships
and virtual screening tools for drug discovery (35,36).
based on the results of our earlier studies (29), a total of
98 1d and 2d descriptors were used as the components of
the compound vector, which include 18 descriptors in the
class of simple molecular properties, 3 descriptors in the
class of chemical properties, 35 descriptors in the class of
molecular connectivity and shape, and 42 descriptors in
the class of electro-topological state. the vector of an
input compound i is then compared with drug j in ttd
by using the tanimoto coeﬃcient sim(i,j) (28):

additional data about the approved, clinical trial and
experimental drugs and their primary targets were collected from a comprehensive search of literatures, fda
drugs@fda webpage (http://www.accessdata.fda.gov)
with information about fda approved drugs, latest
reports from 17 pharmaceutical companies that describe
clinical trial and other pipeline drugs (astrazeneca, bayer,
boehringer ingelheim, genentech, gsk, idenix, incyte,
isis, merck, novartis, pﬁzer, roche, sanoﬁ aventis,
schering-plough, spectrum, takeda, teva). literature
search was conducted by searching pubmed database
using keyword combinations of ‘therapeutic’ and
‘target’, ‘drug’ and ‘target’, ‘clinical trial’ and ‘drug’, and
‘clinical trial’ and ‘target’, and by comprehensive search of
such review journals as nature reviews drug discovery,
trends of pharmaceutical science and drug discovery
today. in particular, these searches identiﬁed 198 recent
papers reporting approved and clinical trial drugs and
their targets. as many of the experimental antisense
drugs are described in us patents, we speciﬁcally
searched us patent databases to identify 745 antisense
drugs targeting 104 targets. primary targets of 211 drugs
and drug binding modes of 79 drugs are not speciﬁed in
our collected documents. further literature search was
conducted to ﬁnd the relevant information for these
drugs. the criteria for identifying the primary target of a
drug or targets of a multi-target drug is based on the
developer or literature reported cell-based or in vivo
evidence that links the target to the therapeutic eﬀect of
the drug. these searched documents are listed in the
respective target or drug entry page of ttd and crosslink
is provided to the respective pubmed abstract, us patent
or developer web-page.
ttd data can be accessed by keyword or customized
search. customized search (figure 1) ﬁelds include target
name, drug name, disease indication, target biochemical
class, target species, drug therapeutic class and drug mode
of action. further information about each target can be
accessed via crosslink to uniprotkb\swissprot, pdb,
kegg, omid and brenda database. further drug information can be accessed via crosslink to pubchem,
drugbank, superdrug and chebi. related target or
drug entries can be recursively searched by clicking a
disease or drug name. similarity targets of an input

protein sequence in fasta format can be searched by
using the blast sequence alignment tool (27).
similarity drugs of an input drug structure can be
searched by using molecular descriptor based tanimoto
similarity searching method (28,29). target and drug
entries are assigned standardized ttd ids for easy identiﬁcation, analysis and linkage to other related databases.
the whole ttd data, target sequences along with
swissprot and entrez gene ids, and drug structures can
be downloaded via the download link. a separate
downloadable ﬁle contains the list of ttd drug id,
drug name and the corresponding ids in other crossmatching databases pubchem, drugbank, superdrug
and chebi. the corresponding hgnc name and
swissprot and entrez gene id of each target is provided
in the target page. the smiles and inchi of each drug
is provided in the drug page.

where l is the number of molecular descriptors. tanimoto
coeﬃcient of similarity compounds are typically in the
range of 0.8–0.9 (37,38). hence compound i is considered
to be very similar, similar, moderately similar, or
un-similar to drug j if sim(i,j) > 0.9, 0.85 < sim(i,j) < 0.9,
0.75 < sim(i,j) < 0.85, or sim(i,j) < 0.75, respectively.
remarks
the updated ttd is intended to be a more useful resource
in complement to other related databases by providing
comprehensive information about the primary targets
and other drug data for the approved, clinical trial and
experimental drugs. in addition to the continuous update
of new target and drug information, eﬀorts will be devoted
to the incorporation of more features into ttd.
increasing amounts of data about the genomic, proteomic,
structural, functional and systems proﬁles of therapeutic
targets have been and are being generated (7–13). apart
from establishing crosslink to the emerging data sources,
some of the proﬁles extracted or derived from the relevant
data (3) may be further incorporated into ttd. target
data has been used for developing target discovery
methods (18–20), some of these methods may be
included in ttd in addition to the blast tool for similarity target searching. as in the case of pdtd (23), some
of the virtual screening methods and datasets (35,36) may
also be included in ttd for facilitating target oriented
drug lead discovery.
