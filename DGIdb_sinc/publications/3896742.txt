photosensitivity reactions induced by drugs may be phototoxic or photoallergic in nature. acute phototoxic reactions are by far the more common. and are generally characterised by erythema and oedema followed by hyperpigmentation and desquamation. chronic
repeated injury of this type may result in fragility. blistering and milia formation or even
actinic keratoses and skin cancers. the photochemical mechanisms involved differ with
the chemical photosensitiser involved. they include photoaddition of the chemical to biological targets such as dna. the formation oftoxic products due to absorption ofthe action
spectrum by the photosensitising molecule. or the activation of toxic oxygen species or free
radicals. subsequent activation of the complement pathways may participate in the photoresponse to certain agents.
photoallergic reactions are uncommon. they represent an acquired altered reactivity
dependent on a circulating antibody or a cell-mediated hypersensitivity process. clinically.
they are characterised by an immediate wheal and flare or a delayed papular to eczematous process. some of the same drugs which cause phototoxic responses occasionally
produce photoallergic reactions.

sun-induced cutaneous reactions have become
increasingly common over the past several decades, due not only to social causes centred on desires for a golden suntan, but also to the ever-expanding numbers and amounts of photosensitising
chemicals entering our environment - primarily
from cosmetic, pharmaceutical and industrial
sources. this article is concerned primarily with
the photosensitising effects of chemicals that are
used as medications therapeutically or as cosmetics.
two types of photosensitivity reactions may be
induced by such chemicals; i.e. they may be phototoxic or photoallergic in nature. phototoxic reactions may be oxygen dependent (photodynamic)

or oxygen independent (non-photodynamic) [blum,
1941 a; epstein, 1971]. photoallergic reactions may
be due to immediate antibody-mediated or delayed
cell-mediated (emi) responses (epstein, 1972;
morison et ai., 1979).
whichever type of response occurs, it must follow the basic law of photochemical absorption
which states that non-ionising radiation must be
absorbed to produce a photochemical and subsequently a photobiological reaction. this law then
stipulates that the photosensitising molecule must
be present at the time of the irradiation for the
reaction to occur. in addition, the action spectrum
for any specific photoreaction must be included in
the absorption spectrum of the photosensitiser.

photosensitivity due to drugs

1. phototoxicity
phototoxic reactions may be drug-induced or
may accompany certain metabolic disorders in
which an appropriate photosensitising chemical is
available in target tissue. in each case, the phototoxic reaction occurs when enough chromophore
(drug or metabolic product) absorbs sufficient radiation in reactive tissue. drug-induced phototoxic
reactions, whether from systemic administration
or topical application, can occur in 100% of people
on first exposure, and using appropriate experimental conditions a dose-response curve can be
demonstrated with the incidence of phototoxicity
being related to the concentration of sensitisers and
amount of light. this section focuses on the clinical
expression and mechanism of phototoxicity due to
topically or systemically administered drugs. it only
briefly considers phototoxicity which accompanies
certain metabolic disorders, such as the porphyrias, in which a photo toxic metabolic product accumulates in skin as the result of an inborn metabolic error.
l.l clinical expressions

1.1.1 acute reactions
in general, acute phototoxic reactions are characterised by erythema, oedema, and at times blister
formation, followed by hyperpigmentation and desquamation (epstein, 1983). these reactions are
confined to sun-exposed skin. immediate burning,
stinging sensations are characteristic of photosensitisation by certain chemicals such as coal tar, demeclocycline (demethylchlortetracycline), and protoporphyrin (in erythropoietic  xxxg781xxx ). the
clinical reaction may begin from a few minutes to
several hours after the irradiation and reach a peak
from several hours to several days later. acute erythema is usually associated with stimulation of'
melanin formation, leading to subsequent hyperpigmentation.
since phototoxic injury results in cell death,
sloughing of the dead epidermal cells presents as
desquamation or peeling. 'sunburn' reaction induced by ultraviolet b (uvb; 290 to 320nm) ra-

43

diation is the classic example of an acute phototoxic reaction.
host effects may influence the natural history
of drug-induced phototoxic reactions. several factors, including hair, pigment, and thickness of the
stratum corneum, influence radiation penetration.
topical photosensitisers are dependent on percutaneous absorption and metabolism in the skin
(anderson and parrish, 1981). systemic chromophores are influenced by gastrointestinal absorption, distribution and metabolism of the chemicals.
in addition, increased humidity, temperature and
wind also enhance phototoxic responses (levine
and harber, 1969; owens and knox, 1978).
histologically, epidermal cell degeneration may
be prominent when the photosensitiser or chromophore is in the epidermis (epstein, 1971). this is
most notable when a potent photosensitiser, such
as a psoralen compound, is applied to the skin. in
contrast, if the chromophore reaches the skin
through the vasculature, the primary site of injury
may be in the dermis, with little or no visible epidermal change (epstein, 1974). in both instances,
there is generally little inflammatory cell response
in the dermis in human skin. when tissue is examined at a submicroscopic level, vascular injury
is associated with protoporphyrin photosensitisation (honigsman et ai., 1976; schnait et ai., 1975).
1.1.2 chronic reactions
lifelong exposure to the sun (most notably uvb
rays) causes clinical cutaneous alterations which
include wrinkling, atrophy, hyper- and hypopigmen ted macules, telangiectasia, yellow papules and
plaques, keratotic growths (actinic keratoses), and
at times skin cancer formation. a distinctive, furrowed, leathery appearance may be seen on the nuchal area of fair-complexioned individuals. the
chronically damaged skin is usually quite fragile,
rupturing following mild trauma. in addition, the
cutaneous blood vessels rupture easily, leading to
areas of purpura; these are due to a loss of structural support by the dermal connective tissue.
histologically, effacement as well as projections
of the rete ridges, a possible thinning of the epidermis, and the presence of many abnormal ker-

photosensitivity due to drugs

atinocytes in disorderly arrangement may be seen.
in the dermis, there is a progressive degeneration
in the papillary and subpapillary zones. specific
changes include the development of vascular ectasia, the accumulation of acid mucopolysaccharides and abnormal-appearing fibrocytes, the loss of
collagen (but an increase in the soluble component), and the marked increase and degeneration
of elastic tissue, referred to as actinic elastosis. although there is still some question as to the origin
of the fibres which stain like elastic tissue, biochemical and electron microscopic studies have
confirmed that actinic elastosis is due to the accumulation of elastic tissue.
in general, most drug-induced phototoxic reactions are acute and phototoxicity may necessitate discontinuation of the drug. however, chronic
actinic changes have been associated with a form
of dermatological psoriasis therapy in which photochemotherapy is employed. in a large series of
psoriatic patients treated with psoralens and ultraviolet a (uva; 320 to 400nm) radiation (puva),
a definite increase in cutaneous cancer formation
was noted (stern et ai., 1979). in addition, there is
histological evidence of focal dystrophy of epidermal cells, atypical changes in melanocytes,
and deposition of colloid bodies and amyloid
at the dermoepidermal junction (abel and farber,
1980).
more recently, an increased cancer incidence in
psoriatic patients who had received very extensive
treatment with coal tar and uvb exposures has
been reported (stern et ai., 1980). this may represent an additive carcinogenic effect between tar
and uvb energy since the action spectrum for coal
tar photosensitisation is the uva range.
a limited form of chronic phototoxic injury occurs'in porphyria cutanea tarda, variegate porphyria, hereditary coproporphyria, and low-grade photosensitisation by certain medications such as
nalidixic acid, tetracycline hydrochloride, and the
sui phones. clinically, this injury is characterised
by fragility, blistering, milia formation, and at times
sclerodermoid changes involving the sun-exposed
skin. in erythropoietic  xxxg781xxx , the skin
frequently becomes quite thick.

1.2 mechanisms
the interactions of light, phototoxic chemicals
and their biological targets may result from several
types of photochemical reactions. in each case,'
damage to biological substrates is initiated by the
absorption of light energy by a phototoxic compound. as already noted, phototoxic reactions have
been divided into 2 categories: oxygen-dependent
(photodynamic) and oxygen-independent (nonphotodynamic) [blum, 1941a; epstein, 1971]. in
the case of drug-induced phototoxicity, recent
studies have resulted in a more detailed understanding of the various mechanisms of phototoxicity.
at least 3 distinct photochemical mechanisms
have been described in in vitro systems (kochevar,
1981). firstly, the direct reaction between the excited state of a phototoxic molecule and a biological target may result in the formation of a covalent
photoaddition product which is comprised of the
compound itself and the biological target. examples include photoaddition of chlorpromazine to
protein or dna, or the light-induced formation of
a photoadduct of  xxxd2602xxx  ( xxxd2602xxx ;  xxxd2602xxx ) and a pyrimidine base in the dna
molecule (song and tapley, 1979). secondly, the
phototoxic molecule absorbs protons to form stable photoproducts which are toxic to biological
substrates. such photoproducts are usually detected by irradiation of the phototoxic molecule
prior to exposure to a potential substrate. examples include erythrocytolysis caused by formation
of a stable photoproduct from chlorpromazine or
protriptyline (kochevar and lamola, 1979).
thirdly, irradiation of a phototoxic molecule may
result in the tranfer of energy to oxygen molecules
with resultant formation of toxic active oxygen
species, such as a singlet oxygen, a superoxide anion, or an hydroxyl radical. interaction of these
species with biological targets produces photo-oxidised molecules. examples include toxic oxygen
species produced by irradiation of protoporphyrin
(lamola and doleideu, 1980), xanthene dyes (ito
and kobayashi, 1977), and thiazine dyes (stratigos
and magnus, 1968).

photosensitivity due to drugs

each of the above photochemical reactions occurs in vitro in a serum-free environment. recent
studies have uncovered a critical role for serum
protein-dependent systems in acute, in vivo, phototoxic tissue damage due to exogenous agents (lim
et ai., 1983). evidence suggests that complement
may participate in the development of phototoxic
lesions. irradiation of normal human serum containing added uroporphyrin or protoporphyrin, or
demeclocycline resulted in complement activation
and generation of chemotactic activity (lim et ai.,
1981, 1983). in vivo activation ofthe complement
system was noted after irradiation of patients with
erythropoietic  xxxg781xxx  or porphyria cutanea tarda (lim et ai., 1982). in addition, normal
numbers of polymorphonuclear cells and an intact
complement system are required for the full development of demeclocycline-induced phototoxic
lesions in an in vivo guinea-pig model system (lim
et ai., 1983). therefore, both serum protein-dependent pathways and circulating, mobile effector
cells appear to be necessary for certain forms of
phototoxic tissue injury.
with the exception of the examples outlined
above, the erythrogenic mediators of photo toxic
reactions are not well understood. unlike uvb
phototoxicity, prostaglandins do not appear to be
involved in  xxxd2602xxx  and uva photoreactions.
anthracene phototoxic-induced hyperaemia in
mouse skin appears to be mediated by histamine
(argenbright et ai., 1980). how this relates to erythematous responses to other molecules and in
other animals remains to be seen. in general, much
more information is needed to clarify the mechanisms which lead to the changes we see in and
during phototoxic cutaneous responses.
1.3 phototoxic agents of special interest

certain frequently used orally and topically administered agents are known to cause phototoxicity (table i). in certain cases, phototoxicity is employed for therapeutic benefit, as in the case of
psoralens and tar, while in other cases phototoxicity is a distinctly adverse event. in this section,
those drugs which are commonly used are re-

45

viewed with respect to clinical problems and mechanisms of phototoxicity.

1.3.1 psora/en phototoxicity
furocoumarins are a class of compounds to
which the psoralens belong; these compounds consist of a double-ringed coumarin moiety with a
furan ring attached. at least 28 different furocoumarins have been isolated from natural sources,
but only 4 are used clinically: psoralen,  xxxd2602xxx  ( xxxd2602xxx ), 5-methoxypsoralen, and
trioxsalen (4,5,8-trimethylpsoralen). the absorption maxima of psoralens range between 210 and
330nm, but the erythema action spectrum is in the
uva range from 320 to 370nm, with a probable
peak at 360nm.
psoralen combined with sun exposure has been
used to treat vitiligo for centuries. the availability
of high intensity artificial uva light sources in the
past decade has permitted the use of psoralens in
combination with controlled doses of uva light
(parrish et ai., 1974). the acronym puva (psoralen and uv a photochemotherapy) is used to indicate this form of dermatological therapy. three
major dermatological diseases are frequently treated
with puva; vitiligo, psoriasis and mycosis fungoides.
mechani~m of phototoxicity
the mechanism of psoralen photosensitisation
has been intensively studied. non-photodynamic
reactions have been described for psoralen photosensitisation (pathak et al., 1974). in this instance certain psoralen compounds intercalate into
the dna helix (song and tapley, 1979). on photoactivation with uva radiation, mono- and bifunctional adducts may be formed in the dna, depending on the structure of the psoralen molecule
and the wavelengths utilised for irradiation (parsons, 1980; pathak et ai., 1974; song and tapley,
1979). photoreactions with proteins may also occur.
it should be noted that psoralens can also produce photodynamic responses (parsons, 1980).
psoralen photoinduced singlet oxygen formation
has been correlated with erythema production by

(parsons, 1980).

1.3.2 chlorpromazine phototoxicity
chlorpromazine is an antipsychotic drug frequently utilised in psychiatric patients. clinical

320-380

photosensitivity to chlorpromazine was first reported in the 1950s (j.h. epstein et ai., 1957) and
the drug is now known to be phototoxic in a variety
of in vitro systems, including red blood cells, bacteria, mammalian cells, bacteriophages and viruses
(kochevar, 1981). ciorpromazine is known to cause
several photodermatoses when taken systemically.
an exagerated sunburn reaction (phototoxicity) and

photosensitivity due to drugs

a hyperpigmentation of purple or slate-grey tone in
light exposed skin have been described. the wavelength range required to elicit a clinical reaction
has been a topic of controversy. chlorpromazine
has an absorption maximum at 305nm in aqueous
solution, but the action spectrum for phototoxicity
has been reported to be both below (j.h. epstein
et ai., 1957) and above (s. epstein, 1968) 320nm
in man. for phototoxicity in mice, the action spectrum has been reported to be 320 to 340nm with
a maximum of 330nm (hunter et ai., 1970).
mechanisms of phototoxicity
the mechanisms of chlorpromazine phototoxicity have been extensively studied and at least two
possible mechanisms have been demonstrated in
vitro. photoaddition of chlorpromazine to protein,
dna, and cell membranes has been reported (rosenthal et ai., 1978). in addition, it appears that
stable photoproducts of chlorpromazine elicit cutaneous toxicity in animals and haemolyse red
blood cells (kochevar and lamola, 1979). in both
systems, toxicity was detected induced by pre-irradiated chlorpromazine. in the case of red cell
haemolysis, the stable lysis-producing product did
not require oxygen for activity nor cause lipid oxidation in the presence of oxygen. thus, chlorpromazine has been shown to be phototoxic in
many systems, but the route of translation of these
in vitro effects to human phototoxicity is unclear.
1.3.3 tetracycline phototoxicity
of the tetracyclines, demeclocycline (demethylchlortetracycline), is the most potent phototoxic
agent. it causes both immediate and delayed reactions in most individuals, according to
dose (kligman, 1962; maibach et ai., 1967). human studies indicate that the action spectrum for
demeclocycline phototoxicity is above 320nm, and
studies in mice demonstrate an effective radiation
range of 350 to 450nm, with the greatest response
at 400nm.
recent experiments have clearly demonstrated
a requirement for complement and polymorphonuclear leucocytes as amplifiers or effectors of demeclocycline phototoxicity (lim et ai., 1983).

47

1.3.4 nalidixic acid phototoxicity
nalidixic acid is a bacteriostatic agent commonly used to treat urinary tract infections. in association with extensive sun exposure, nalidixic acid
has caused characteristic bullous eruptions, fragility, scarring and milum formation in light-exposed
areas, particularly the lower legs and feet (ramsay
and obreshkova, 1974). similar reactions have been
noted for tetracycline hydrochloride and sulphones
(epstein et ai., 1976).
while the mechanisms of nalidixic acid phototoxicity are not known, the clinical and histopathological changes are identical to those found
in a number of porphyrias (epstein et ai., 1973).
1.3.5 phototoxicity due to non-steroidal
anti-inflammatory agents
in the past 10 years many new non-steroidal
anti-inflammatory drugs have been introduced and
are widely used to treat a variety of inflammatory
and symptomatic musculoskeletal disorders. two
ofthese agents, benoxaprofen (now withdrawn) and
 xxxd2969xxx , are known to cause clinically important
phototoxicity.
benoxaprofen is a proprionic acid derivative
which was introduced into the european and
united states markets for treatment of rheumatoid
arthritis, osteoarthritis,  xxxg1055xxx  and
psoriasis. the drug was suspended because it caused
instances of fatal cholestatic hepatitis, especially in
the elderly. unlike other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs which act principally by inhibiting
prostaglandin synthetase, benoxaprofen is primarily a  xxxg147xxx  inhibitor. benoxaprofen caused
side effects in up to 65% of patients, and cutaneous
reactions were the most common, accounting for
70% of all side effects (halsey, 1982). the commonest cutaneous side effect was photosensitivity,
which occured in up to 29% of patients on the drug,
the incidence depending on skin type and amount
of uv exposure. the action spectrum of the phototoxic reaction is 310 to 340nm. the reaction is
manifested as immediate itching, burning and erythema (ferguson, 1982). the mechanism of this
phototoxicity is unknown.
 xxxd2969xxx  is an  xxxd3311xxx  which inhibits prosta-

48

photosensitivity due to drugs

glandin synthetase and is used for treatment of
rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, gout and  xxxg1055xxx . while the incidence of cutaneous side effects is around 2.4%, a unique photosensitivity due to  xxxd2969xxx  has been reported in
several patients (stern and bigby, 1984). the photosensitivity reaction is usually vesiculobullous and
is often pruritic. the spectrum and mechanisms of
photosensitivity are unknown.
1.4 testing for phototoxicity
agents capable of producing phototoxic effects
have been identified by use of a variety of in vitro
and in vivo systems. however, the ultimate issue
concerns the effect these compounds have on human tissue in vivo (emmet, 1979; kligman and
kaidbey, 1982). in general, the following 4 techniques have been utilised: systemic administration,
topical application with occlusion, topical application after the stratum corneum is stripped off,
and intradermal injection. each of the techniques
has disadvantages, among which are lack of distribution to the skin of the active photosensitising
molecule, metabolism of the chemical to a nonphotosensitising structure, lack of metabolism to
an active photosensitising structure, lack of penetration to the appropriate target tissue, lack of irradiation with the appropriate wavelengths, and
lack of irradiation at the appropriate time.

2. photoallergy
2.1 definition
photoallergic reactions are uncommon. as with
allergic responses in general, they are acquired altered reactivities presumably dependent on an
antigen antibody or cell-mediated hypersensitivity
phenomenon. clinically, they present as an immediate wheal and flare or a delayed papular to
eczematous dermatitis (j.h. epstein, 1971, 1972;
s. epstein, 1962; morison et ai., 1979; storck, 1965).
microscopically, these delayed reactions are characterised by a dense dermal perivascular round cell
infiltrate similar to that seen in allergic contact der-

matltls. though vasodilitation and oedema are
present in the immediate reaction, these are difficult to discern histologically.
2.2 photoallergic reactions to exogenous
chemicals
photoallergic reactions to drugs and other exogenous chemicals are almost always of a delayed
hypersensitivity or cell-mediated type. an exception was reported by horio (1975) who studied a
patient with clinical expressions of both immediate
and delayed reactions induced by chlorpromazine.
he was able to reproduce both responses with photopatch and intradermal tests and uva radiation.
in addition, he passively transferred the immediate
wheal reaction with the patient's serum. masuda
et ai. (1971) noted an immediate wheal response
with photopatch tests in 2 of 44 patients who were
contact-photosensitive to biothionoi. they were
also able to passively transfer the reaction. however, the patients did not demonstrate solar urticarial responses clinically.
the skin is the site of photoallergic reactions to
exogenous chemicals which may be applied topically or administered systemically. as with phototoxicity, in the photoallergic reactions to these
chemicals the action spectrum usually falls in the
uva range. the immunological basis for these reactions is supported primarily by studies on contact photoallergy.

2.2.1 photoallergic contact dermatitis
clinical expression
photoallergic contact reactions are clinically
identical to any other type of allergic contact dermatitis. thus the spectrum of the possible responses may range from a simple erythema to a
severe vesiculobullous eruption. the most common picture is eczematous in nature. when the
process is chronic, lichenification results from repeated mechanical trauma (rubbing and scratching). the sun-exposed areas of the skin are involved primarily, as would be expected. however,
the eruption may extend to unexposed parts of the

photosensitivity due to drugs

body and even become generalised due to conditioned irritability and autoeczematisation reactions. even when this occurs the dermatitis is most
notable in the exposed sites.
histologically, there is generally some intercellular oedema in the epidermis with or without vesicle formation, depending on the clinical pattern.
however, the characteristic finding is present in the
dermis and consists of a dense perivascular round
cell infiltrate, which is identical to that found in
any allergic contact dermatitis response.
adults 1i.re much more commonly affected than
children. obviously the reactions will occur in
populations that are exposed to sunlight and the
photocontactants. thus, reactions to the optical
brighteners are more likely to be seen in occupations where they are used: those to chlorpromazine
would more likely occur in people who work in
mental institutions, and so on. perhaps the most
extensive statistical data have been compiled on
the eruptions induced by the halogenated salicylanilides and related antibacterial compounds because of the large number of people photosensitised by these agents between 1960 and 1970
(herman and sams, 1972). the reactions occurred
predominantly in men past the age of 40 years. the
reason for this age and sex distribution is unknown. skin colour and race apparently have little
influence on the problem, since the reaction occurs
readily in blacks and orientals as well as caucasians.
in general, removal of the offending photosensitiser and related compounds will eliminate the
problem once the eruption has subsided. a small
percentage of patients who have developed this
process will become persistent light reactors (jillson and baughman, 1963). these are people who
continue to develop the dermatitis on sun-exposed
areas without apparent further contact with the offending agent or related structures. these patients
tend to be exquisitely sensitive to the sun and usually have very low uvb minimal erythema doses.
the incidence of this most disturbing problem is
unknown, but it probably represents only a small
percentage of those who become contact photosensitive. however, up to 25% of patients with pho-

49

tocontact reactions to the halogenated salicylaniiides severe enough to necessitate consultation at
medical centres have been persistent light reactors.
in our studies with antibacterial halogenated salicylanilides we found two types of persistent light
reactors: a mild variety that loses its reactivity
within 1.5 years and a severe type that appears to
persist indefinitely (epstein et ai., 1968).
chemicals other than the antibacterial halogenated salicylanilides have induced persistent light
reactions, including the related antifungal compound buclosamide (burry, 1970; burry and
hunter, 1970), chlorpromazine (amblard et ai.,
1982; burdick, 1969; wiskemann and wulf, 1959),
promethazine (sidi et ai., 1955), musk ambrette
(giovinazzo et ai., 1980) and epoxy resins (allen
and kaidbey, 1979). persistent light reactions induced in guinea-pigs with sulphonamides have also
been noted (schwarz and speck, 1957), and one of
us has observed a phototoxic persistent light reaction induced by systemic demeclocycline that has
persisted 3 years (epstein, unpublished data). the
mechanism or mechanisms of this persistent light
reactivity are not clear. cross-reactions to unknown photocontactants have been considered.
willis and kligman (l968a) presented evidence
suggesting that the reactions could result from the
retention of small amounts of the photosensitiser
in the dermis. these authors also reported that the
lowered minimal erythema dose in persistent light
reactors was a photoallergic reaction, which resembled a sunburn.
photoinduced covalent binding of tetrachlorosalicylanilide to the albumin molecule has been
demonstrated by kochevar (1979). other possibilities include: (a) the persistence of a sensitised
mononuclear infiltrate in the dermis, which will
react on minimal antigenic exposure; (b) hypersensitivity to the protein component of the complete
antigen, which then becomes an independent photoallergen; or (c) the development of clones of cells
that are persistently sensitive to a number of photoallergens (herman and sams, 1972). also, a possible relationship to the chronic eczematous type
of polymorphous light eruption has been reported
(epstein et ai., 1968).

photosensitivity due to drugs

diagnosis
the differential diagnosis includes essentially
any eruption that may involve the sun-exposed
skin. however, for practical purposes, allergic contact dermatitis, the eczematous type of polymorphous light eruption, and phototoxic reactions are
by far the most important.
airborne allergens will primarily contact exposed skin. unlike photocontactant reactions, the
airborne contact eruption will be accentuated in fold
areas such as the upper eyelids, antecubital fossae,
and the flexural areas of the wrists, etc., because of
concentration of the airborne material in these
areas. differentiation from allergic contact reactions to sunscreens, 'suntanning' lotions and
creams, and medications used to relieve the discomfort of a sunburn is more difficult since they
are confined to the sun-exposed areas and are indistinguishable clinically and histologically. the
same is true for the eczematous type of polymorphous light eruption.
phototoxic reactions induced by topical or systemic exogenous photosensitisers will have the same
distribution as the photoallergic reactions. the
clinical picture and lack of the dermal round cell
infiltrate histologically will usually serve to make
this differentiation. however, the most useful diagnostic tools available are the patch, photopatch, and
phototesting procedures.
the diagnosis of photocontact dermatitis is suspected by the clinical picture, including the character and distribution of the eruption and the histology. confirmation and identification of the
offending chemical depends on photopatch testing.
this is accomplished by the application in duplicate of non-irritating concentrations of the potential photosensitisers in appropriate vehicles (i.e. a
1% concentration of halogenated salicylanilides in
petrolatum). the use of an extra layer of black paper· over the patches will help prevent a 'masked'
positive reaction to the photopatch test (epstein,
1963); this is unnecessary with the use of aluminium patches. 24 hours later one set of patches is
irradiated with the uva rays. any light source that
emits sufficient amounts of these rays can be utilised, including the sun, hot quartz lamps, fluores-

cent tubes, zenon arcs, carbon arcs, and monochromatic sources (harber et ai., 1974). window
glass filtration is necessary if there is a significant
amount ofuvb emitted by the lamp, as in the case
of the hot quartz source. 24 hours after the irradiation the closed and exposed sites are compared.
the reading techniques are identical to those used
in evaluation of ordinary patch tests. a positive
reaction to the photopatch tests reproduces the
clinical lesions morphologically and histologically.
certain difficulties with patch testing may occur.
if the patient is contact allergic to a chemical it
may be difficult to determine if he or she is photocontact allergic as well. however, in general, the
photopatch test site will be much more reactive than
the patch test area in a patient with dual sensitivity.
another significant problem concerns identifying the potential photoallergen. the history may
be helpful in this determination. unfortunately
patients often do not know what they contacted
(except for suntan oils or the like). this is especially true of preservatives and ingredients in soaps.
we use the following series of compounds routinely and add whatever can be determined from
the history: 5% para-aminobenzoic acid (paba);
amyl dimethyl paba; glyceryl paba; 5% musk
ambrette; octyl dimethyl paba; oxybenzone;
dioxybenzone; 0.25% tetrachlorosalicylanilide: and
1% tribromosalicylanilide.
we also routinely patch test with the screening
materials suggested by the north american contact dermatitis groups (nacdg, 1974) to evaluate other potential contactants and phototest to
examine for polymorphous light eruption (epstein,
1966).
photocontactants
photoallergic reactions to a number of topically
contacted chemicals have been reported. these include: sulphonamides (epstein, 1962; schwarz and
speck, 1957; storck, 1965); phenothiazines (amblard et ai., 1982; burdick, 1969; epstein, 1960a,
1968; epstein and rowe, 1957; ertle, 1982; horio,
1975; polano, 1964; sidi et ai., 1955; storck,
1965; torinuki et ai., 1982); sulphonylcarbamides

photosensitivity due to drugs

(burckhardt and schwarz-speck, 1957); men's colognes and after-shave lotions (epstein, 1969; starke,
1967); blankophores (optical brighteners) [burckhardt, 1957]; persian lime rind (epstein, 1956);
ragweed (epstein, 1960b); sunscreens (davies et ai.,
1982; fagerlund et ai., 1983; fitzpatrick et al., 1963;
goldman and epstein, 1969; h6z1e and plewig,
1982; kaidbey and allen, 1981; mathias et al., 1978;
sams, 1956; satulsky, 1950); diphenhydramine
(emmett, 1974); psoralens (fulton and willis, 1968;
sidi and bourgeois-cavardin, 1953); epoxy resins
(allen and kaidbey, 1979); and quindoxin (scott
and dawson, 1974; zanoun et ai., 1976). however,
the halogenated salicylanilides and related antibacterial and antifungal compounds represented the
most important group of allergic contact photosensitisers. in the 1960s these chemicals were responsible for almost an epidemic of photoallergic reactions. tetrachlorosalicylanilide was perhaps the
most potent photosensitiser of this type. between
1960 and 1961 it was responsible for an estimated
to,ooo cases in england (wilkinson, 1961) before
it was removed from general use. subsequently, a
number of related phenolic compounds were incorporated into soaps and other vehicles to combat
infection, reduce body odour, act as preservatives,
and destroy fungi. photocontact reactions were induced by many of these agents, including bithionol, the brominated salicylanilides,  xxxd2274xxx , dichlorophen, the carbanilides, fenticlor
[bis (2-hydroxy-5-chlorophenyl) sulphide], bromochlorosalicylanilide, ' xxxd3159xxx ' (a mixture of buclosamide and  xxxd3159xxx ) [epstein, 1972; herman
and sams, 1972], and chloro-2-phenylphenol (adams, 1972).
since 1968, there has been a rapid decline in the
induction of photocontact dermatitis by the halogenated salicylanilides and related compounds
(smith and epstein, 1977). this is most likely due
to the removal of the more potent of these photosensitisers from general use. however, within the
past 5 years, 2 new contactants appear to produce
most, if not all, photoallergic responses. these are
the two widely used fragrance compounds 6-methylcoumarin (jackson et ai., 1980; kaidbey and
kligman, 1978) and musk ambrette (galosi and

51

plewig, 1982; giovinazzo et ai., 1980; raugi et ai.,
1979). in addition, musk ambrette has been reported to be responsible for the induction of a persistent light reactor state similar to that noted with
the halogenated salicylanilides (giovinazzo et ai.,
1980). the action spectrum for the photoallergic
reactions to these fragrances appears to fall in the
uva range (giovinazzo et ai., 1981; jackson et ai.,
1980; kaidbey and kligman, 1978).
mechanisms involved in development of
photocontact reactions
the clinical appearance, histology and photopatch test responses strongly suggest that the photoreactions described in this discussion are dependent on a cell-mediated immunity process. a
number of experimental studies utilising animal and
human models have supported this concept.
herman and sams (1972), using micro-ouchterlony immune diffusion techniques, could not
demonstrate antibodies to 3,5-dibromosalicylanilide (3,5-dbs) protein complexes in the serum of
patients photocontact-sensitive to this chemical. no
binding of fluorescein-tagged goat antihuman igg,
iga, igm and complement or fibrin was noted in
positive photopatch test sites with the direct
immunofluorescence methods. in addition, immunoglobulins in serum from patients photosensitive to tetrachlorosalicylanilide and 3,5-dbs did
not bind to cutaneous tissues bathed in these
chemicals. thus, no evidence of antibody-mediated hypersensitivity was discovered in patients
with photocontact reactions to the halogenated
salicylanilides.
photoallergic reactions in human skin characteristic of cell-mediated immunity responses have
been induced by a number of agents including the
sulphonamides (epstein, 1939), phenothiazines
(burdick, 1969), and the halogenated salicylanilides (willis and kligman, 1968b). perhaps the most
extensive studies have been performed with the
halogenated salicylanilides. willis and kligman
utilised uvb as well as uv a exposures plus the
chemicals to induce photosensitivity, but only uv a
and the halogenated salicylanilides were used to
elicit the photocontact allergy.

photosensitivity due to drugs

as noted, animal and human studies have confirmed the cell-mediated immunity mechanism for
the photocontact allergy reactions, which appears
to be identical to the mechanism of contact allergy
itself. however, the nature of the antigen has not
been settled. the studies of burckhardt and
schwarz-speck (1957), jung and schwarz (1965)
and schwarz and speck (1957) with sulphonamide
and related compounds, those of epstein and enta
(1965), jung and schultz (1968) and willis and
kligman (l968b, 1969) with the halogenated salicylanilides, and those of fulton and willis (1968)
with methoxypsoralens suggested that the haptens
were stable photoproducts of these chemicals. in
vitro binding studies have also supported this concept.
an alternative concept was proposed by jenkins
et al. (1964). they concluded that the photoproducts might well be shortlived free radicals, which
would attach to the protein carrier within microseconds to form the complete antigen. support for
this theory has developed from clinical observations (epstein, 1972; herman and sams, 1972; osmundsen, 1969). in addition, jung's studies of
postirradiation free radical formation and subsequent binding to albumin and fj-globulin of chlorpramazine (jung, 1970) and triplet state induction
by radiation of triacetyldiphenylisatin with deactivation by binding to albumin, 'y-giobulin, and skin
protein (jung, 1967) present further evidence in favour of this concept. the studies of jung et al.
(1968a,b) with ' xxxd3159xxx ' (buclosamide/ xxxd3159xxx )
were even more supportive of this second theory
immunologically. they were able to demonstrate
protein binding in vitro after irradiation. this in
vitro protein complex then acted as a full antigen
on· plain patch testing of ' xxxd3159xxx '-photosensitive
patients.
as can be seen, there is a significant discrepancy
between the theories concerning the origin of the
antigen in photocontact reactions. most probably
both theories are correct under different circumstances; i.e. it is likely that at least some of the
subjects experimentally photosensitised by willis
and kligman (l968b) were actually contact sensitised by stable photoproducts of the chemicals. in

52

contrast, the available evidence suggests that the
haptens in clinically acquired disease are unstable
photoproducts, perhaps free radicals, which must
be in close proximity to the protein carrier at the
time of irradiation.
experimental predictive testing models
determination of the potential for a chemical
to induce allergic contact sensitisation has depended on demonstration of such reactions in
patients who have clinically developed photocontact allergies to the chemical. though animal
models are readily available for phototoxicity studies, their use in evaluation of photoallergic reactions has presented a more complicated problem.
schwarz and speck (1957) first reported the induction of photoallergic contact dermatitis to sulphanilamide in guinea-pigs. subsequently, photoallergic contact reactions in guinea-pigs have been
induced by tetrachlorosalicylanilide and related
compounds, chlorpromazine, musk ambrette and
6-methylcoumarin (harber, 1981; jordan, 1982).
in vitro and in animals, immunological studies have
supported the cell-mediated nature of the hypersensitivity (harber et ai., 1959, 1967; herman and
sams, 1972; jung et ai., i 968a,b). more recently,
mouse models have been shown to be most efficient for experimentally examining this problem
(maguire and kaidbey, 1982; miyachi and takigawa, 1983). using such animals, demonstration of
the necessity of langerhans cells apparently to process the photoallergen appropriately, the need for
genetically dependent t cells for the development
of the reactivity, and the inhibiting influence of
uvb-induced suppressor t cells, have been established under experimental conditions (granstein et
ai., 1983; miyachi and takigawa, 1982; takigawa
and miyachi, 1982). however, to date, no animal
models have proved to be predictive for screening
the potential for chemicals which had not previously been identified to produce photoallergic contact reactions.
human predictive testing models
predictive testing in human skin is even less definitive. in the i 960s, identification of tetrachlo-

photosensitivity due to drugs

rosalicylanilide and related phenolic compounds
was accomplished by photopatch testing clinically
involved patients. subsequently, willis and kligman (1968b) induced contact photoallergy to certain of these agents in normal human subjects using a modification of the maximisation test developed for evaluating the potential for chemicals to
produce contact dermatitis (kligman, 1966).
recently, kaidbey and kligman (kaidbey, 1983;
kaidbey and kligman, 1980) modified the photomaximisation procedure. with the new test they
were able to photoallergically contact sensitise normal human volunteers relatively readily to certain
methylated coumarin derivatives, tetrachlorosalicylanilide, 3,5-dbs, chlorpromazine, and sodium
pyrithione. a lesser number of positive induction
responses were noted with tribromosalicylanilide
contaminated with 47% dibromosalicylanilide, 4,
5-dbs, buclosamide, and bithionoi. however, negative results were noted with para-aminobenzoic
acid and musk ambrette which have produced
photoallergic contact reactions clinically. the authors considered them weak photosensitisers.
thus, to date there is no proven effective
predictive testing model for photoallergic contact
dermatitis.
2.2.2 systemic drug photoallergy
photoallergic reactions to systemic photosensitisers are less common than those induced by contactants and they are less well understood. however, a few apparent photoallergic reactions have
been reported to a number of agents, including the
antibacterial sulphonamides (blum, 1941 b; burckhardt, 1941; epstein, 1939; schwarz and speck,
1957; stevanovic, 1961), sulphonylurea antidiabetic agents (hitselberger and foxnaugh, '1962),
the thiazide diuretics (harber et ai., 1959) and
 xxxd3066xxx  (miller and beltrani, 1966), phenothiazines (calnan et ai., 1962; schultz et ai., 1956),
oral contraceptive hormones (erickson and peterka, 1968),  xxxd2235xxx  (chang, 1965), chlordiazepoxide hydrochloride (luton and finchum,
1965), several antihistamines (schreiber and naylor, 1962), triacetyldiphenylisatin (kasuistik and
jung, 1967), the artificial sweetener calcium cycla-

53

mate (kobori and araki, 1966; lamberg, 1967;
tatsuji and toshie, 1963), chloroquine (van weelden et ai., 1982), quinidine (lang, 1983; marx et
ai., 1983),  xxxd446xxx  (merot et ai., 1983) and 5fluorocytosine (beardmore, 1979; shelley and sica,
1983).
clinical expression
the reaction times for these responses appear
to be delayed in nature and the clinical eruptions
range from lichenoid papules to eczematous
changes. though the problems are generally short
term in nature, occasionally persistent light reactivity may be induced by these systemic photosensitisers (s. epstein, 1962).
histologically, the lichenoid eruptions resemble
lichen planus with a subepidermal band of round
cells. in addition, they have a perivascular round
cell infiltrate deeper in the dermis. the eczematous
eruptions show epidermal oedema and a dermal
round cell infiltrate.
diagnosis
the diagnosis of photoallergy is usually made
on morphological, histological, and historical
grounds. in some instances reproduction of the
photoallergic response has been accomplished by
exposure to the appropriate action spectrum. however, the use of injections or topical applications
with occlusion or after stripping may be useful if
the agent itself, and not a metabolite, is responsible
for the photosensitivity.
there is little information concerning the mechanisms involved in the development of these reactions induced by systemic medications. however, th~y do appear to be delayed hypersensitivity
responses. thus the principles noted in section 2.2.1
on photoallergic contact dermatitis should apply.

3. therapy of drug-induced
photosensitivity
therapy of acute photoallergic or phototoxic responses is identical to that used for any such inflammatory reactions. this includes the use of topical cool wet dressings, soothing shake lotions,

photosensitivity due to drugs

topical corticosteroids and systemic antipruritic
agents.
if the process is severe enough, systemic corticosteroids may be indicated. as with any topical
or systemic drug-induced eruption, removal of the
offending agent is essential to the cure of the allergic process. in the case of photoallergy or phototoxicity, either the sun or the chemical could be
removed. the radiant energy is more difficult to
control; therefore removal of the chemical is usually the most appropriate approach since the patient
frequently is made exquisitely sensitive by the
drugs. at times, the medication may be indispensable and avoidance of the sun is essential.
as noted previously, some patients may develop persistent light eruptions which persist after
discontinuing use of the offending agent. when this
occurs, the patient usually becomes markedly photosensitive. long term anti-inflammatory therapy
and avoidance of any sun exposure may be necessary to control such a process.

toxicological applications of cytochemistry,
histochemistry
and immunohistochemistry
date: 24-27 september 1985
venue: jesus college, university of cambridge, cambridge
the appropriate application of cyto-, histo- and immunohistochemical techniques in toxicology
- the dichotomy between cellular structure and function - identification of early degenerative
changes - quantification of repair processes - definition of aspects of the biochemical events
which produce pathological response - safety evaluation of chemicals - understanding of toxic
lesions - improved detection of lesions - better interpretation of risk assessment in response to
chemical exposure - toxicity testing - molecular events associated with chemically induced
changes.
