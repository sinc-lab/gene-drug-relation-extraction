abstract: multiple myeloma is a common plasma cell neoplasm that is incurable with
conventional therapy. the treatment paradigm of multiple myeloma is not standardized and
is evolving. the advent of novel drugs, including the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib and
the immunomodulatory agents, has resulted in increased median survival. unfortunately,
all patients eventually relapse and require further therapy.  xxxd2984xxx  is the newest
immunomodulatory drug, created by chemical modification of thalidomide with the intention of
increasing therapeutic activity while limiting toxicity. its mechanism of action is incompletely
understood but involves anti-angiogenic effects, immunomodulation, an effect on the myeloma
tumor microenvironment, and the  xxxg514xxx . it is more potent than thalidomide and
lenalidomide. in phase ii studies, it has shown significant activity in patients with relapsed
and refractory multiple myeloma, including patients who are heavily pretreated, have disease
refractory to lenalidomide and bortezomib, and those with high-risk cytogenetic or molecular
markers. it is generally well tolerated, with adverse effects including fatigue, neutropenia,
neuropathy, and thromboembolic disease.  xxxd2984xxx  is a promising new agent in the
expanding arsenal of antimyeloma drugs. in this review, we discuss the clinical experience to
date with  xxxd2984xxx  in multiple myeloma.

introduction
multiple myeloma (mm) is a plasma cell neoplasm affecting 1 to 5 per 100,000 individuals,
with a higher incidence in the developed world
[jemal et al. 2011]. in 2012 in the united states,
it is expected that 21,700 people will be diagnosed with mm and 10,710 will die of the disease
[siegel et al. 2012].
therapy for mm is evolving. the advent of novel
agents including the immunomodulatory drugs
(imids) thalidomide and lenalidomide, and the
proteasome inhibitor bortezomib has resulted in a
50% improvement in median survival [kumar et al.
2008]. unfortunately, in spite of these improvements, mm remains incurable with conventional
therapy and relapse is inevitable in all patients.
thalidomide was the first immunomodulatory
agent to show activity in mm [singhal et al. 1999].

angiogenic cytokines and bone marrow vascularization, prominent features in mm, were potential
targets to exploit the anti-angiogenic properties of
thalidomide [singhal et al. 1999]. the combination of thalidomide and dexamethasone results in
response rates of 40–50% in relapsed mm [von
lilienfeld-toal et al. 2008]. favorable clinical
results prompted development of the thalidomide
analogs lenalidomide and  xxxd2984xxx , collectively known as the imids. these agents were
designed to improve the therapeutic activity of thalidomide while reducing toxicity. indeed, response
rates of 55–60% to lenalidomide and dexamethasone have been seen in relapsed mm [dimopoulos
et al. 2007; weber et al. 2007].

therapeutic advances in hematology 4 (3)
mechanism of action
the imids exert their anticancer effects in
several ways including angiogenesis inhibition,
immunomodulation, impeding cytokine production, and interaction with the bone marrow and
tumor microenvironment. recently, the protein
 xxxg514xxx  has been identified as a target of thalidomide [ito et al. 2010], and its presence appears to
be important for imid response [zhu et al. 2012].
the anti-angiogenic effect of thalidomide was first
demonstrated by its ability to inhibit angiogenesis
induced by  xxxg787xxx  in a rabbit
cornea micropocket assay [d’amato et al. 1994].
this was felt to be independent of tumor necrosis
factor alpha (tnf-alpha) production [d’amato et al.
1994]. immunomodulatory mechanisms, including cytotoxic t-cell stimulation [corral et al. 1999;
haslett et al. 1998] and increased natural killer
(nk) cell activity [davies et al. 2001; reddy et al.
2008] have been illustrated with imid exposure.
direct cytotoxic effects have also been shown by the
imids, including the inhibition of nuclear factor
kappa-b (nf- kappab) and apoptosis induction via the
 xxxg342xxx /death receptor pathway [keifer et al.
2001; mitsiades et al. 2002]. the anti-inflammatory
effects of  xxxd2984xxx  have been demonstrated
by its ability to inhibit cox-2 production and
prostaglandin generation in lipopolysaccharide
(lps)-stimulated monocytes [ferguson et al.
2007]. lytic bone disease is a major cause of morbidity in patients with mm, and most patients will
have bone involvement at some point in their disease course. importantly,  xxxd2984xxx  downregulates the transcription factor pu.1, resulting in
reduced osteoclast production and differentiation
[anderson et al. 2006].

correlated with lenalidomide resistance [zhu et al.
2011; lopez-girona et al. 2012]. interestingly,
 xxxd2984xxx  appears to remain effective in lenalidomide resistant cells [lopez-girona et al. 2012].
 xxxd2984xxx  is felt to be the most potent imid:
100 times strength of thalidomide and 10 times
that of lenalidomide [gertz, 2013].
 xxxg514xxx  expression by gene expression profiling
was recently evaluated in 53 patients with
relapsed/refractory mm treated with  xxxd2984xxx  and dexamethasone [schuster et al. 2012].
in this study,  xxxg514xxx  expression was shown to
predict both progression-free survival and overall
survival. when patients in the lowest quartile of
 xxxg514xxx  expression were compared with the
highest quartile, progression-free survival was 3.0
months versus 8.9 months and overall survival was
9.1 months versus 27.2 months.

the proliferation and survival of myeloma cells is
largely unaffected by thalidomide, whereas lenalidomide and  xxxd2984xxx  cause both cell cycle
arrest and apoptosis [zhu et al. 2012]. specifically,
they induce cell cycle arrest by p21 waf activation independently of p53 [escoubet-lozach
et al. 2009]. this highlights the possibility in using
these agents to treat p53 mutated malignancies
[escoubet-lozach et al. 2009].

phase i studies
a total of 24 patients with relapsed or refractory
mm were studied in a phase i open-label dose escalation (1, 2, 5, and 10 mg) study [schey et al. 2004].
despite a median of three lines of previous therapy
including thalidomide (53%) and autologous stem
cell transplant (40%), 54% of patients achieved at
least a partial response (pr) with 17% achieving
complete remission (cr) [schey et al. 2004]. this
was confirmed in a second phase i study of 20 heavily pretreated patients using an alternate day regimen, with 50% of patients achieving at least a pr
and 10% achieving cr [streetly et al. 2008]. these
two studies were conducted prior to the novel agents
bortezomib and lenalidomide being readily available, potentially partially explaining the response
rates seen in these pretreated patients. mm-002 is a
randomized phase i/ii open-label dose escalation
study of heavily treated patients refractory to both
lenalidomide and bortezomib. this study established a maximum tolerated dose of 4 mg for 21 of
28 days in this patient population. efficacy results of
the 38 patients in the phase i study showed 21%
achieving at least a pr; in patients refractory to both
lenalidomide and dexamethasone, 25% had a
response [richardson et al. 2012].

 xxxg514xxx  is a highly conserved e3 ligase protein
[lopez-girona et al. 2012]. imid activity in myeloma may depend on its expression. it has been
shown to be a binding target for thalidomide [ito
et al. 2010], and more recently for lenalidomide
and  xxxd2984xxx  [lopez-girona et al. 2012].
decreased  xxxg514xxx  mrna expression has been

phase ii studies
the first phase ii study of  xxxd2984xxx  and dexamethasone evaluated 60 patients with relapsed or
refractory mm with 1–3 prior treatments [lacy
et al. 2009].  xxxd2984xxx  was administered at a
dose of 2 mg daily continuously (28 day cycles),

with dexamethasone 40 mg weekly. response was
seen in 63% of patients, with 5% achieving cr,
28% achieving very good partial response
(vgpr), and 30% achieving pr according to
the international myeloma working group criteria. importantly, responses were seen in 40%
of lenalidomide-refractory patients, 37% of thalidomide-refractory patients, and 60% of bortezomib-refractory patients. responses were seen
in 74% of patients with high-risk cytogenetic or
molecular markers including a plasma cell labeling index ≥3%, deletion 17p, t(4;14) or t(14;16)
by fluorescent in situ hybridization, or deletion 13
on conventional cytogenetics. median progression-free survival was 11.6 months.
results of the phase ii study of the aforementioned mm-002 trial have been presented
[jagannath et al. 2012]. patients were randomized
to receive  xxxd2984xxx  alone (4 mg/day, days
1–21 of 28-day cycle), or  xxxd2984xxx  with lowdose dexamethasone (40 mg/week). a total of 221
patients were randomized, 108 to the  xxxd2984xxx  alone arm and 113 to  xxxd2984xxx  and
dexamethasone. responses (≥pr) were seen in
34% of the combination group and 15% in the
 xxxd2984xxx  alone arm, with median progression-free survival of 4.6 months and 2.5 months.
the clapd trial is a randomized phase ii study of
100 patients treated with  xxxd1713xxx 
twice daily,  xxxd2984xxx  4 mg on days 1–21 of a
28-day cycle, and dexamethasone 40 mg weekly
[mark et al. 2012]. of note, this cohort of patients
was highly refractory with 73%, 70%, and 64%
being refractory to lenalidomide, bortezomib, or
both, respectively. the overall response rate (≥pr)
was 53.6% with 21.6% of patients achieving
vgpr. median progression free survival was 82
months. at last follow up, median overall survival
has not been reached with 72 patients (74%) alive.
 xxxd2984xxx  in patients refractory to
imids and bortezomib
patients with relapsed mm that is refractory to
bortezomib and the imids thalidomide and lenalidomide have a poor prognosis: median survival is
9 months, and event-free survival of just 5 months
[kumar et al. 2009]. much of the subsequent
work with  xxxd2984xxx  has focused on these
patients who require salvage therapy.
the mayo clinic group treated a cohort of 34
patients with lenalidomide refractory disease with

continuous  xxxd2984xxx  (2 mg/day) and weekly
dexamethasone (40 mg/week) [lacy et al. 2010].
the overall response rate was 47%, with 31%
achieving at least a pr. the median time to
response was 2 months, response duration was
9.1 months, and median overall survival was 13.9
months. the mm-002 trial discussed above
included patients treated with lenalidomide and
bortezomib [richardson et al. 2011]. in patients
refractory to both agents, 30% of patients treated
with  xxxd2984xxx  and dexamethasone and 16%
of those on  xxxd2984xxx  alone achieved pr.
the ifm 2009-02 phase ii  xxxd2984xxx  study
by the french intergroup evaluated patients with
symptomatic progressive disease following at least
two cycles of bortezomib and two cycles of lenalidomide in combination or separately [leleu et al.
2011]. these were heavily pretreated patients,
with median time from diagnosis to enrollment of
70.5 months and median number of five prior
therapies. two schedules of  xxxd2984xxx  were
evaluated: 4 mg daily on days 1–21 of a 28-day
cycle (arm a) and 4 mg continuously on days
1–28 of a 28-day cycle (arm b). both regimens
included dexamethasone 40 mg weekly. median
follow up was 10.4 months. a total of 84 patients
were enrolled, 43 in arm a and 41 in arm b. there
was no significant difference between the two
arms. the overall response rate was 34.9% in arm
a and 34.1% in arm b. stable disease was reported
in 40 patients (47.6%) overall. median progression-free survival was 6.3 months overall, with
median duration of response of 11.4 months in
arm a and 7.9 months in arm b.
the mayo clinic group compared two dosing
strategies from two sequential phase ii studies of
patients refractory to both bortezomib and lenalidomide [lacy et al. 2011].  xxxd2984xxx  was
administered at 2 mg daily or 4 mg daily with
dexamethasone 40 mg weekly for 28 day cycles.
with 35 evaluable patients in each cohort, the 2
mg cohort had an overall response rate (mr or
better) of 49% while the 4 mg group had an overall response rate of 43%. in both cohorts, 26% of
patients achieved at least a pr. while nonrandomized, these results suggest that 4 mg daily dosing does not yield superior responses than 2 mg
daily dosing. recently, long-term follow up of 345
patients treated with  xxxd2984xxx  and low dose
dexamethasone at mayo clinic were presented
showing similar efficacy between the 2 and 4 mg
dose levels [lacy et al. 2012]. in contrast, a trend
towards a dose-dependent response was seen in

therapeutic advances in hematology 4 (3)
the 38 patients studied in the recently published
phase i mm-002 study previously mentioned
[richardson et al. 2012].
the mm-003 trial is a large multicenter randomized phase iii trial comparing  xxxd2984xxx 
and low-dose dexamethasone to high-dose dexamethasone (hd) in 455 patients with mm refractory to lenalidomide and bortezomib [dimopoulos
et al. 2012]. patients were randomized to receive
 xxxd2984xxx  4 mg daily for 21 of 28 days and
dexamethasone 40 mg weekly versus dexamethasone 40 mg on days 1–4, 9–12, and 17–20 of a
28-day cycle. benefit was seen in progression-free
survival, with a median of 15.7 weeks in the
 xxxd2984xxx –dexamethasone arm versus 8.0
weeks with dexamethasone alone. overall survival
advantage was also reported, with median overall
survival not reached in the  xxxd2984xxx –dexamethasone arm versus 34 weeks in the hd arm.
extramedullary disease
extramedullary disease (emd) is very common
in patients with end-stage mm and can occur in
lymph nodes, soft tissues, skin, muscles, and other
organs. it has been associated with a poor response
to treatment and shortened overall survival. emd
was present at diagnosis in 13/174 patients (7.5%)
in the aforementioned initial phase ii mayo clinic
study of 174 patients with relapsed/refractory
mm [short et al. 2011]. response rate for emd
was 31%, with two patients achieving cr and
two patients achieving pr. this illustrates that
 xxxd2984xxx  is active and effective in emd.
toxicity
the major toxicity described in patients with
relapsed/refractory mm treated with  xxxd2984xxx 
is neutropenia. grade 3–4 neutropenia is reported
in 26–66% of patients, with heavily treated patients
and higher doses leading to higher incidence [lacy
et al. 2009, 2010, 2011]. thrombocytopenia and
anemia are also common side effects of therapy,
however grade 3–4 toxicity is seen in 13% and 17%
of patients, respectively [lacy et al. 2012].
nonhematologic toxicities are seen in 5% of
patients [lacy et al. 2012]. fatigue is the most
commonly reported adverse effect, with 62% of
patients experiencing fatigue and 8% of those
patients with grade 3–4 fatigue [lacy et al. 2012].
thromboembolic events are a well-known
complication of imid therapy, occurring in

approximately 2–4% of patients with imids alone
and up to 12–26% in patients treated with an
imid/dexamethasone combination [carrier et al.
2011]. the incidence in  xxxd2984xxx -treated
patients is similar to patients treated with the other
imids. venous thromboembolism occurred at a
rate of 3% in the 345 patients studied at the mayo
clinic [lacy et al. 2012], and in 2% of the 221
patients in the mm-002 trial [jagannath et al.
2012]. prophylactic treatment with acetylsalicylic
acid at doses of 325 mg daily is a reasonable strategy to prevent thromboembolic complications in
these patients and has been successfully used in
 xxxd2984xxx  clinical trials to date [lacy et al.
2009, 2010]. in the mayo clinic trials, neuropathy
has been reported in up to 33% of patients, many
of who have pre-existing neuropathy that worsens
[lacy et al. 2012]. however, in the mm-002 trial,
grade 1–2 peripheral neuropathy was seen in 13%
of patients [jagannath et al. 2012], whereas no
neuropathy was reported in the ifm 2009-02 trial
[leleu et al. 2010]. acute noninfectious pulmonary toxicity has been described in two patients
[geyer et al. 2011], and grade 3+ pneumonitis
was reported in 1% of patients in the mayo clinic
series [lacy et al. 2012]. this injury seems to
respond to corticosteroids, and re-introduction of
 xxxd2984xxx  has been successful.
conclusions
 xxxd2984xxx  is a third-generation immunomodulatory agent with significant activity in
mm. it has shown impressive results in patients
who are refractory to lenalidomide, suggesting
non-cross-resistance. it also has activity in
patients refractory to both lenalidomide and
bortezomib, with 26% of patients achieving at
least a pr and remission duration of 12 months
[lacy et al. 2011]. response rates of 74% in
patients with high risk cytogenetic or molecular
markers provide a viable option in this group of
patients who are often challenging to treat at
relapse [lacy et al. 2009]. no prospective randomized studies have delineated optimal dose,
however, available data suggests that efficacy
and toxicity are similar at the 2 and 4 mg dose
levels.  xxxd2984xxx  is well tolerated, minimally toxic, and easy to use, which are important features of a drug used in heavily treated,
multiply relapsed patients.
