1  xxxd3302xxx  (zelnorms) is a potent 5-hydroxytryptamine4 ( xxxg1117xxx ) receptor agonist with clinical
efficacy in disorders associated with reduced gastrointestinal motility and transit. the present study
investigated the interaction of  xxxd3302xxx  with 5-ht2 receptors, and compared its potency in this
respect to its  xxxg1117xxx  receptor agonist activity.
2  xxxd3302xxx  had significant binding affinity for human recombinant 5-ht2a, 5-ht2b and 5-ht2c
receptors (pki ¼ 7.5, 8.4 and 7.0, respectively). the  xxxg1114xxx -binding affinity of  xxxd3302xxx  was
identical to that at human recombinant  xxxg1117xxx (c) receptors (mean pki ¼ 8.4) in human embryonic
kidney-293 (hek-293) cells stably transfected with the human  xxxg1117xxx (c) receptor.
3  xxxd3302xxx  (0.1–3 mm) inhibited 5-ht-mediated contraction of the rat isolated stomach fundus
potently (pa2 ¼ 8.3), consistent with  xxxg1114xxx  antagonist activity.  xxxd3302xxx  produced, with
similar potency, an elevation of adenosine 30 ,50 cyclic monophosphate in hek-293 cells stably
transfected with the human  xxxg1117xxx (c) receptor (mean pec50 ¼ 8.6), as well as  xxxg1117xxx  receptor-mediated
relaxation of the rat isolated oesophagus (mean pec50 ¼ 8.2) and contraction of the guinea-pig
isolated colon (mean pec50 ¼ 8.3).
4 following subcutaneous administration,  xxxd3302xxx  (0.3 or 1 mg kg1) inhibited contractions of the
stomach fundus in anaesthetized rats in response to intravenous dosing of a-methyl 5-ht
(0.03 mg kg1) and bw 723c86 (0.3 mg kg1), selective  xxxg1114xxx  agonists. at similar doses,
 xxxd3302xxx  (1 and 3 mg kg1 subcutaneously) evoked a  xxxg1117xxx  receptor-mediated increase in colonic
transit in conscious guinea-pigs.
5 the data from this study indicate that  xxxd3302xxx  antagonizes 5-ht2b receptors at concentrations
similar to those that activate  xxxg1117xxx  receptors. it remains to be determined whether this 5-ht2b
receptor antagonist activity of  xxxd3302xxx  contributes to its clinical profile.

introduction
5-hydroxytryptamine (5-ht) plays a pivotal physiological role
in the regulation of gastrointestinal motility (read & gwee,
1994). of the recognized 5-ht receptor subtypes (hoyer &
martin, 1997), 5-ht1, 5-ht2a, 5-ht2b, 5-ht3 and  xxxg1117xxx 
receptors mediate many of the gastrointestinal responses to 5ht. activation of  xxxg1117xxx  receptors, for example, on motor
neurones and interneurones within the gut wall, is associated
with facilitation of cholinergic and nonadrenergic, noncholinergic neurotransmission. release of acetylcholine,  xxxg2240xxx  and
calcitonin gene-related peptide results in propulsion of contents
along the gastrointestinal tract (jin et al., 1999). additionally, 5ht4 receptors are expressed on smooth muscle cells, activation
of which results in, for example, oesophageal relaxation in rats
(briejer et al., 2001) and inhibition of human colonic circular
muscle contractile activity (hillier et al., 1994). furthermore,

activation of  xxxg1117xxx  receptors on enteric neurones or enterocytes
promotes fluid secretion in the gastrointestinal tract in a variety
of species, including man (hansen & skadhauge, 1997).
in support of the postulated role of  xxxg1117xxx  receptor
activation in the regulation of gastrointestinal motility, 5ht4 receptor agonists such as  xxxd1708xxx  (propulsids),  xxxd3039xxx ,  xxxd3097xxx  and  xxxd3302xxx  have demonstrated efficacy
in patients with constipation-predominant irritable bowel
syndrome (cibs), chronic constipation, functional dyspepsia
or gastroparesis (deruyttere et al., 1987; muller-lissner, 1987;
abell et al., 1991; camilleri, 2001).  xxxd3302xxx  was recently
approved for the short-term treatment of cibs in females
and chronic constipation in males and females, in the united
states and some other countries. preclinical investigation
has demonstrated that  xxxd3302xxx  has high binding affinity at
human  xxxg1117xxx  receptors (hoyer et al., 1998).  xxxd3302xxx 
produces relaxation of canine rectal circular smooth muscle
(prins et al., 1999), neuronally mediated contraction of the
guinea-pig ileum (buchheit et al., 1995) and initiation or

550

d.t. beattie et al

facilitation of the peristaltic reflex in guinea-pig, rat and
human intestine (grider et al., 1998; ji et al., 2004). all of these
effects are attributed to  xxxg1117xxx  receptor agonist activity.
 xxxd3302xxx  also attenuates sensory neurotransmission in the
human rectum (coffin et al., 2003), consistent with its ability
to relieve the sensory symptoms of cibs.
it is evident from limited published data that  xxxd3302xxx  and
structurally related analogues are not selective for the  xxxg1117xxx 
receptor, having some affinity for 5-ht1 and 5-ht2 receptors
(buchheit et al., 1995; briejer et al., 2001). an interaction of
 xxxd3302xxx  with the 5-ht2a and  xxxg1114xxx  subtypes
would be expected to influence gastrointestinal activity. 5ht2a receptors are located on enteric neurones and smooth
muscle cells of the gastrointestinal tract, and their activation
is associated with, for example, secretion from isolated human
colonic mucosa, and contraction of canine stomach or canine
and guinea-pig colonic longitudinal smooth muscle (borman &
burleigh, 1996; prins et al., 1997; fiorica-howells et al., 2002).
5-ht2b receptors are located in the longitudinal and circular
smooth muscle layers, and in the myenteric nerve plexus of the
gastrointestinal tract in a variety of species, including man
(engel et al., 1984; borman et al., 2002). furthermore, 5-ht2b
receptor activation is associated with a neuronally mediated
enhancement of electrically evoked contractile activity of
human isolated colonic longitudinal smooth muscle (borman
et al., 2002). it is postulated that  xxxg1114xxx  antagonism
may result in inhibition of both 5-ht-mediated gastrointestinal motility and visceral hypersensitivity.
the primary objective of the present investigation was
to study the interaction of  xxxd3302xxx  with 5-ht2 receptors.
following demonstration of high binding affinity for  xxxd3302xxx  at 5-ht2b receptors (vide infra), its functional activity at
this subtype was characterized in vitro and in vivo. in addition
to determining the extent of  xxxd3302xxx  binding at human
recombinant 5-ht2b receptors, its 5-ht2b functional activity
was evaluated in the rat isolated stomach fundus, a tissue that
contracts in response to  xxxg1114xxx  activation (bonhaus
et al., 1999). contractile activity of the stomach fundus in
anaesthetized rats was also recorded to investigate the
influence of  xxxd3302xxx  on  xxxg1114xxx -mediated responses
in vivo. to assess the significance of any  xxxg1114xxx 
interaction, the agonist activity of  xxxd3302xxx  at human, rat and
guinea-pig  xxxg1117xxx  receptors was determined. thus, radioligand
binding and camp accumulation studies were carried out
using human recombinant  xxxg1117xxx (c) receptors. the  xxxg1117xxx 
receptor activity of  xxxd3302xxx  was also investigated in vitro,
in the rat oesophageal tunica muscularis mucosa and guineapig colonic longitudinal muscle/myenteric plexus preparations,
and, in vivo, in a guinea-pig colonic transit model. in the
majority of the assays,  xxxd2943xxx  and sb 206553, selective 5ht4 and 5-ht2b/2c receptor antagonists, respectively (kennett
et al., 1996; sanger et al., 1998), were used to establish the
nature of the pharmacological responses measured. preliminary data were presented at the digestive disease week
meeting, held in new orleans, may 15–20, 2004.

receptor-binding studies
cell membrane preparation radioligand-binding studies
were conducted using membranes prepared from cell lines
transfected with the respective human recombinant receptor.
membranes prepared from chinese hamster ovary-k1 (chok1) cells stably transfected with 5-ht2a and 5-ht2c receptors
were prepared as described previously (stam et al., 1994;
bonhaus et al., 1995). membranes prepared from cho-k1
cells stably transfected with 5-ht2b receptors were purchased
from euroscreen (brussels, belgium). hek-293 cells stably
transfected with the human recombinant  xxxg1117xxx (c) receptor
splice variant were cultured in dulbecco’s modified eagles
medium (dmem) supplemented with d-glucose (4500 mg l1),
10% foetal bovine serum and 100 u of penicillin (100 mg)–
streptomycin ml1 and  xxxd2191xxx  (800 mg ml1) in a 5% co2,
humidified incubator (371c). at 20–22 h prior to harvest, cells
were washed twice and then cultured in serum-free dmem.
cells were harvested by gentle mechanical agitation and then
centrifugation (1200  g for 5 min). the pellet was resuspended
in 50 mm 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)piperazine-1-ethanesulphonic acid
acid)
n-(2-hydroxyethyl)piperazine-n0 -(2-ethanesulphonic
(hepes), ph 7.4, and homogenized with a polytron disrupter
(setting 19, 2  10 s) on ice. the resultant homogenate was
centrifuged (1200  g for 5 min), the pellet discarded and the
supernatant centrifuged (40,000  g for 20 min). the pellet was
washed once by resuspension in 50 mm hepes (ph 7.4), and
centrifugation (40,000  g for 20 min). the final pellet was
resuspended in 50 mm hepes (ph 7.4) and aliquots stored at
801c, until required.
binding assay conditions

human recombinant 5-ht2a, 5ht2b, 5-ht2c and  xxxg1117xxx (c) receptor membrane radioligandbinding assays were conducted as described previously (grossman et al., 1993; stam et al., 1994; bonhaus et al., 1995;
pindon et al., 2002). briefly, membranes prepared from cells
stably transfected with human recombinant 5-ht2a, 5-ht2b,
5-ht2c and  xxxg1117xxx (c) receptors were incubated with radiolabelled ligands with a high affinity for the given receptor, that
is, [3h] xxxd2419xxx , [n-methyl-3h] xxxd2527xxx 
(lsd), [3h]mesulergine and [3h]gr113808, respectively.
nonspecific radioligand binding was defined by  xxxd2419xxx 
(1 mm), 5-ht (10 mm), sb 242084 (10 mm) and gr113808
(1 mm), respectively.
competition-binding studies were conducted with increasing
concentrations of unlabelled ligand (10 pm–30 mm) and a
fixed concentration of radioligand (in nm): [3h] xxxd2419xxx 
(0.5), [n-methyl-3h]lsd (1.2), [3h]mesulergine (1) and
[3h]gr113808 (0.15). for [3h]gr113808, the radioligand
concentration was b6-fold the kd value, but for all others the
concentration was at, or close to, the kd. following an
incubation period sufficient to reach equilibrium: 15 min at
371c, 30 min at 371c, 30 min at 371c and 60 min at 221c,
respectively, the membranes were harvested by rapid filtration
and bound radioactivity quantitated by liquid scintillation
spectroscopy.
binding data were analysed by nonlinear regression analysis
using graphpad prismt software (graphpad software, inc.,
san diego, ca, u.s.a.) and a three-parameter model for
one-site competition. pki (negative decadic logarithm of ki)
values for test compounds were calculated from the best-fit
ic50 values, and the kd value of the radioligand, using the

d.t. beattie et al

cheng–prusoff equation (cheng & prusoff, 1973): ki ¼ ic50/
(1 þ [l]/kd), where [l] is the concentration of the radioligand.

functional  xxxg1114xxx  activity
rat isolated stomach fundus the rat stomach fundus
responds to 5-ht with a  xxxg1114xxx -mediated contraction (bonhaus et al., 1999). adult, male sprague–dawley rats
(200–350 g, harlan, in, u.s.a.) were euthanized by co2
asphyxiation and thoracotamy. the stomach was cut transversely to isolate the fundus, and the contents were removed by
cutting along the smaller curvature of the fundus. the tissue
was then transferred to a petri dish containing tyrode’s buffer
containing (in mm): kcl (2.4), nah2po4 (0.4), mgcl2 (1.1),
nacl (136.9), d-glucose (5.6), nahco3 (11.9), cacl2 (1.8),
corticosterone (0.03, to prevent 5-ht uptake) and  xxxd2850xxx 
(0.1, to inhibit monoamine oxidase). the tissue was cut into
strips of approximately 20 mm in length and 2 mm in width,
and the longitudinal muscle in each strip was then gently
removed from the circular muscle and mucosa by lifting it
away with fine forceps. each strip was mounted, under a
tension of 1 g, in a tissue bath filled with tyrode’s solution.
the solution was aerated with 95% o2/5% co2 and
maintained at 371c.
tissues were allowed to equilibrate for approximately 1 h
with washing at 0, 30 and 45 min. a cumulative concentration–
effect curve to 5-ht (0.0001–1 mm, in half log increments) was
then constructed. upon completion of the 5-ht concentration–effect curve, the tissues were washed every 5 min for the
next 30 min and every 10 min for a further 30 min.  xxxd3302xxx 
was then added and allowed to equilibrate with the tissue for
1 h, and a second concentration–effect curve to 5-ht was then
constructed.
changes in tension of the fundus (and the other in vitro
tissue preparations used in this study; vide infra) were recorded
by means of a force transducer (world precision instruments,
model fort 100), amplifier (astro med., model s48) and a data
acquisition system (biopac mp100, acknowledget waveform
acquisition and analysis software). agonist responses (%
maximum contraction) were normalized to the maximum
response of the first 5-ht concentration–effect curve. data
were analysed through iterative curve fitting to a logistic
equation using prismt (graphpad, inc., san diego, ca,
u.s.a.). the equation used was as follows:
y ¼ bottom þ ðtop  bottomþ=ð1 þ 10ððlogec50  xþ
 hillslopeþþ
where x is the logarithm of the drug concentration, and y is
the response (starting from the bottom of the curve and going
to the top with a sigmoid shape). for antagonist studies, the
concentration ratios (with respect to the 5-ht concentration–
effect curves in the absence and presence of antagonist) were
calculated, and a pkb (calculated at a single antagonist
concentration) or pa2 value determined by schild regression
analysis (arunlakshana & schild, 1959).

rat stomach pressure

adult male sprague–dawley rats
(280–390 g, harlan, in, u.s.a.), fasted overnight prior to
the study, were anaesthetized with isoflurane (3%) in oxygen.
the abdomen was shaved and a midline incision made
to expose the duodenum. a small incision was made in the
duodenum, approximately 2 cm from the pyloric sphincter,

and a water-filled balloon (size no. 6, harvard), connected to a
polyethylene catheter (pe50 tubing), was inserted into the
stomach fundus via the duodenal incision. the catheter was
connected to a pressure transducer and data acquisition system
(biopac mp100, acknowledget waveform acquisition and
analysis software) to allow continuous recording of fundus
pressure to be made. the incisions in the duodenum and
abdomen were closed (4–0 silk suture; ethicon, inc., somerville, nj, u.s.a.) and a stitch in the skin was used to secure the
balloon catheter. the balloon was then filled with 3.0 ml of
water from a 10 ml syringe using an infusion pump
(0.5 ml min1, world precision instruments, sarasota, fl,
u.s.a. sp230iw). an incision was made in the neck, and the
left jugular vein and carotid artery were exposed and
catheterized (pe50 tubing). the carotid arterial cannula (prefilled with heparin (50 u ml1) in 0.9% saline) was connected
via a pressure transducer (biopac) to the biopac data
acquisition system to enable the measurement of blood
pressure.
rats were allowed at least 30 min to stabilize following
surgery. typically, spontaneous rhythmical changes in balloon
pressure commenced during this period, representing contractility of the stomach fundus. the selective  xxxg1114xxx 
agonists, a-methyl 5-ht (0.03 mg kg1) and bw 723c86
(0.3 mg kg1), or their vehicles, were administered via the
jugular venous catheter (1 ml kg1). these doses of a-methyl
5-ht and bw 723c86 were selected, as in initial experiments
they were associated with increases in stomach pressure
without marked changes in blood pressure. at 15 min after
dosing with a-methyl 5-ht (0.03 mg kg1),  xxxd3302xxx  or its
vehicle was administered subcutaneously (1 ml kg1). the
selective  xxxg1117xxx  receptor antagonist,  xxxd2943xxx  (1 mg kg1;
sanger et al., 1998), was co-administered with  xxxd3302xxx  to
exclude any influence of  xxxg1117xxx  receptor activation on stomach
pressure. after a further 15 min, rats were dosed with a-methyl
5-ht (0.03 mg kg1). responses to a-methyl 5-ht were
compared, by measuring the amplitude and area of stomach
contractions, and data were expressed for the second a-methyl
5-ht challenge as a percentage of the first (statistical
significance at po0.05 by anova and dunnett’s post hoc
test, comparing the  xxxd3302xxx  and vehicle-induced responses).
to avoid tachyphylaxis, each rat was challenged only once
with bw 723c86, 15 min after subcutaneous co-administration
of  xxxd2943xxx  (1 mg kg1) with either  xxxd3302xxx  (1 mg kg1) or
its vehicle, and data were compared by unpaired student’s ttest, with statistical significance set at po0.05. the effect of
the selective 5-ht2b/2c receptor antagonist, sb 206553
(1 mg kg1; kennett et al., 1996), on the bw 723c86 responses
was also investigated.

60–80% confluency and, at 20–22 h prior to harvest, washed
twice and then cultured in serum-free dmem. to harvest the
cells, the media was aspirated and the cells were incubated
for 5 min at room temperature with versene (life technologies, inc., grand island, ny, u.s.a.). the cells were lifted
from the flask by gentle mechanical agitation, suspended in
pre-warmed (371c) dulbecco’s phosphate-buffered saline, and
then harvested by centrifugation at 1200  g for 5 min. the
supernatant was discarded and the pellet was resuspended in
pre-warmed (371c) ‘stimulation buffer’ provided with the
flashplate kit.

measurement of camp formation

briefly, cells were
diluted to a concentration of 5  105 cells ml1 in pre-warmed
(371c) ‘stimulation buffer’, and preincubated at 371c for
10 min.  xxxd1773xxx  accumulation assays were performed with
increasing concentrations of  xxxd3302xxx  and 5-ht (10 pm–
100 mm). cell suspension (50 ml) was added to each well of
the flashplate for a final assay volume of 100 ml. the cells
were incubated, with shaking, at 371c for 15 min. after the
incubation period, a direct radioimmunoassay, using 125icamp, was performed by the addition of 100 ml of ice-cold
‘detection buffer’ to each well, according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. the plates were sealed and incubated at 41c,
overnight. bound radioactivity was quantified by scintillation
proximity spectroscopy using the topcount (packard
bioscience co., meriden, ct, u.s.a.).
the amount of camp produced was extrapolated from a
camp standard curve. data were analysed by nonlinear
regression analysis with the graphpad prism software
package (graphpad software, inc., san diego, ca, u.s.a.)
using the three-parameter sigmoidal dose model (slope
constrained to unity). potency data were reported as pec50
values (negative decadic logarithm of the effective concentration producing 50% of the maximum response; mean7s.d.,
n43). to determine the intrinsic activity (ia), relative to 5ht, the maximum compound-evoked response (minus basal)
was expressed as a percentage of the maximum response
evoked by 5-ht (minus basal), assayed in parallel on the same
plate.

rat isolated oesophagus the rat precontracted oesophageal tunica muscularis mucosa responds to  xxxg1117xxx  receptor
activation with relaxation (briejer et al., 2001). adult, male
sprague–dawley rats (250–350 g, harlan, in, u.s.a.) were
euthanized by co2 asphyxiation and thoracotamy. the
thoracic oesophagus was removed and placed in tyrode’s
buffer containing (in mm) indomethacin (3.0; to inhibit
prostaglandin synthesis), corticosterone (30.0; to prevent 5ht uptake) and  xxxd2419xxx  (1.0; to block 5-ht2 receptors). a
pair of scissors was inserted between the submucosal layers
and the outer striated muscle coat was cut longitudinally, and
then gently peeled away leaving the inner tunica muscularis
mucosa. preparations of the tunica muscularis mucosa, each
approximately 20 mm in length and 2 mm in width, were
mounted longitudinally in 10 ml tissue baths filled with
tyrode’s solution, which were aerated continuously with
95% o2/5% co2, and maintained at 371c.
a tension of 0.5 g was applied to each tissue. during the next
60 min, tissues were washed at 15 min intervals and tension reapplied to 0.5 g as necessary. carbachol (3 mm; determined to
be a submaximal concentration in initial experiments) was then
british journal of pharmacology vol 143 (5)

5-ht2b antagonist activity of  xxxd3302xxx 

added to the tissue baths to contract the oesophagus. when the
contraction had reached a maximum and the tone had
stabilized, a cumulative concentration–effect curve to 5-ht
(0.001–10 mm in half-log increments) was constructed. upon
completion of the concentration–effect curve, the tissues were
washed four times at 5 min intervals and then three more times
every 15 min. carbachol (3 mm) was then added to the tissue
baths, and, when the contraction had stabilized, concentration–effect curves to  xxxd3302xxx  or 5-ht (each at 0.001–10 mm),
were constructed. responses (i.e. relaxations of carbacholinduced tone) were allowed to reach a maximum before
addition of the next, ascending concentration. the mean
potency (pec50) and ia (as a percentage of the 5-ht
maximum response observed in the first 5-ht concentration–effect curve) were derived through iterative curve fitting
(prismt; graphpad, inc.).

guinea-pig isolated colon adult, male dunkin hartley
guinea-pigs (200–300 g, harlan, in, u.s.a.) were euthanized
by co2 asphyxiation and thoracotamy. the colon was
removed, and placed in krebs-henseleit physiological buffer,
containing (in mm): kcl (4.7), kh2po4 (1.2),  xxxd2534xxx 
anhydrous (1.2), nacl (118.1), d-glucose (11.1), nahco3
(25.0), cacl2 (2.6), ondansetron (0.003; to block 5-ht3
receptors),  xxxd2621xxx  (0.001; to block 5-ht1 and 5-ht2
receptors) and indomethacin (0.001; to inhibit prostaglandin
synthesis). the colon was cut into 5 cm lengths, the contents
gently removed and each segment then placed on a 10 ml
pipette. an incision was made along the length of the colon
with a scalpel blade, and the longitudinal muscle was then
peeled off carefully using the tip of a thumb. each longitudinal
muscle strip was then mounted, under a tension of 1 g, in a
10 ml tissue bath filled with krebs-henseleit buffer. the
bathing solution was aerated continuously with 95% o2/5%
co2, and maintained at 371c.
during the next 45 min, tissues were washed three times (at
0, 15 and 30 min after mounting) and tension re-applied to 1 g
as necessary. the tissues were then challenged with 5-ht at
a concentration (0.3 mm) previously established to evoke a
maximal contractile response. once the contraction had
reached its maximum, tissues were washed four times every
2 min and once more 10 min later. an additional priming
challenge of 5-ht (0.3 mm) was made 15 min later. following
further washing prior to, and after a third 5-ht (0.3 mm)
challenge, a cumulative concentration–effect curve to 5-ht
(0.0001–3 mm) or  xxxd3302xxx  (0.0001–10 mm) was constructed.
responses were allowed to reach a maximum before addition
of the next, ascending concentration. contractile responses
were normalized to the primed 5-ht (0.3 mm) response in each
tissue. data were analysed through iterative curve fitting to a
logistic equation using prismt (graphpad, inc.). the mean
potency (pec50) and ia (as a percentage of the 5-ht
maximum response) were derived.
colonic transit in conscious guinea-pigs adult, male
duncan hartley guinea-pigs (220–580 g, harlan, in, u.s.a.)
were acclimated to the holding room (temperature controlled
at 21711c and 12 : 12 h light–dark cycle commencing at
07:00 h) for at least 1 week following arrival.
guinea-pigs were anaesthetized with isoflurane (2–3%) in
an induction chamber. maintenance of anaesthesia was
achieved with isoflurane (2–3%) administered via a nose cone.

the mid-scapular area and abdomen were shaved and cleansed
with betadine and 70% isopropanol. the proximal colon
was exposed, and a small incision made (approximately 2 cm
from the cecum). a cannula consisting of micro-renathane
(mre-040) tubing with a 2 cm silicone rubber tip (0.04700
od  0.02500 id) was introduced and advanced approximately
2 cm towards the aboral end. a purse-string suture (6-0 silk)
was used to fix the cannula in the colon and an antibiotic
(baytrils; 2.27%) was then applied to the incision. the muscle
layer was closed with a 4-0 vicryls suture (ethicon, inc.). the
cannula was then secured to the nearby musculature with a 6-0
silk suture (ethicon, inc.) and tunnelled subcutaneously under
the skin and exteriorized at the mid-scapular region. the
cannula was sealed with a stainless steel pin and secured to the
back of the neck with wound clips. the incisions in the
peritoneum and abdomen were cleansed of blood and closed
with a 3-0 ethilons suture (ethicon, inc.). buprenexs
(0.03 mg kg1) was administered subcutaneously immediately
after surgery.
at least 5 days post-surgery, guinea-pigs were assigned
randomly to a study group. at 5 min after subcutaneous
administration of  xxxd3302xxx  (0.03–3 mg kg1) or vehicle,
guinea-pigs were gently restrained and a nonabsorbable
marker (0.2 ml) was infused into the proximal colon via the
implanted cannula. the marker consisted of 6 g of carmine red
dye per 15 ml of carboxymethyl cellulose (0.5%). the study
personnel were blinded to the treatment that each animal
received.
commencing at 60 min after the infusion of the dye, animal
cages were inspected visually for the presence of excreted red
faecal pellets. this was repeated at 30 min intervals until each
guinea-pig had excreted pellets containing the red marker, or
until 10 h had lapsed from the time of the marker injection. in
the case that an animal failed to produce red faecal pellets
within 10 h, the animal was left overnight and inspected the
following morning. if excretion of dye occurred overnight,
a value of 10 h was assigned. any guinea-pig that failed to
produce red faecal pellets was removed from the study, and a
post-mortem exploration of the abdominal cavity was
performed. in these rare instances (o1% of animals), it was
generally noted that the colonic catheter had been dislodged
from the colon.
the whole colonic transit was defined as the time that lapsed
between marker injection and the appearance of dye in
the faeces. data for each treatment group were averaged
and expressed as the mean (7s.d.) transit time. differences
between treatment groups were then determined using one-way

colonic transit in conscious guinea-pigs

in vehicle-treated
guinea-pigs, the mean time taken for excretion of the first
faecal pellet containing red dye was typically between 220

(0.03, 0.3 and 3 mg kg1), but not its vehicle (10% sbe/cd,
2 ml kg1), produced a dose-dependent, prokinetic effect
(figure 4).  xxxd3302xxx  produced an increase in transit of
approximately 40% compared to its vehicle. co-administration with  xxxd2943xxx  (1 mg kg1 subcutaneously), but not its
vehicle (d5w, 2 ml kg1), attenuated the colonic prokinetic

conclusions
disorders of reduced gastrointestinal motility and transit,
such as cibs, functional dyspepsia and diabetic gastroparesis,
are commonly associated with discomfort, nausea and
pain, and, as a result, have a debilitating impact on the
quality of life of affected individuals.  xxxd3302xxx , a potent
 xxxg1117xxx  receptor agonist, was introduced recently for the
treatment of cibs and chronic constipation, and is currently
under clinical evaluation in diabetic gastroparesis, gastrooesophageal reflux disease and functional dyspepsia. although
the clinical efficacy of  xxxd3302xxx  has been attributed to  xxxg1117xxx 
receptor agonist activity, it is evident that  xxxd3302xxx  and
structurally related analogues have affinity for other, non-5ht4 receptors relevant to gastrointestinal function (e.g. the 5ht2 receptor family; buchheit et al., 1995). the present study
characterized the in vitro and in vivo activity of  xxxd3302xxx  at
 xxxg1117xxx  and 5-ht2 receptors. an interaction of  xxxd3302xxx 
with 5-ht2a or 5-ht2b receptors could have clinical significance as these 5-ht receptor subtypes are located on
gastrointestinal smooth muscle cells and enteric neurones,
where their activation is associated with enhancement of
gastrointestinal motility or secretion (engel et al., 1984;
borman & burleigh, 1996; prins et al., 1997; borman et al.,
2002). in addition to  xxxd3302xxx , the selective  xxxg1113xxx 
agonists, a-methyl 5-ht and bw 723c86, and the selective
 xxxg1117xxx  or 5-ht2b/2c receptor antagonists (i.e.  xxxd2943xxx  and
sb 206553, respectively), were used as pharmacological
tools to validate the study findings. the in vitro 5-ht2b and
 xxxg1117xxx  receptor-binding affinities and functional potencies
of these compounds, and their observed receptor
subtype selectivities, were consistent with published literature
(baxter, 1996; kennett et al., 1996; sanger et al., 1998;
porter et al., 1999). of the  xxxg1113xxx  subtypes, a-methyl
5-ht and bw 723c86 possess at least 10- or 80-fold
higher affinity, respectively, for human and rat 5-ht2b
receptors over the 5-ht2a and 5-ht2c subtypes,
and considerably greater selectivity over other non-5-ht2
receptors (baxter, 1996; porter et al., 1999). sb 206553 is a
potent, mixed 5-ht2b/2c receptor antagonist with at least 100fold selectivity over 5-ht2a and non-5-ht2 receptors (kennett
et al., 1996).

in vitro studies, using a cell line stably expressing human
recombinant  xxxg1117xxx (c) receptors, confirmed that  xxxd3302xxx  is a
high-affinity, potent  xxxg1117xxx  receptor agonist, consistent with
published data (buchheit et al., 1995; hoyer et al., 1998). in
the present study,  xxxd3302xxx  was a full agonist (relative to
5-ht) at human  xxxg1117xxx (c) receptors, with respect to stimulation
of camp accumulation. consistent with this observation,
pindon et al. (2002) have reported that  xxxd3302xxx  is a potent,
full agonist at both  xxxg1117xxx (a) and  xxxg1117xxx (b) receptor
splice variants. it should be noted that  xxxd3302xxx  is also a
full agonist at guinea-pig recombinant  xxxg1117xxx  receptors
(vickery et al., 2004). the rat tunica muscularis mucosa
and guinea-pig colonic longitudinal muscle/myenteric plexus
preparations were used to confirm the  xxxg1117xxx  receptor agonist
potency of  xxxd3302xxx . a considerable amount of data supports
the view that  xxxg1117xxx  receptor activation is responsible for
the smooth muscle relaxant or neurogenic contractile responses in the rat oesophagus or guinea-pig colon, respectively
(wardle & sanger, 1993; briejer et al., 2001). in the rat isolated
oesophagus,  xxxd3302xxx  relaxed carbachol-precontracted tone
with a potency similar to that observed in the human
recombinant  xxxg1117xxx (c) receptor camp accumulation experiments. similarly,  xxxd3302xxx  behaved as a potent  xxxg1117xxx 

receptor agonist in the guinea-pig colonic longitudinal
muscle/myenteric plexus preparation. in the rat oesophagus
and guinea-pig colon preparations,  xxxd3302xxx  had a lower
ia than 5-ht (73 and 54% relative to 5-ht, respectively),
consistent with its partial agonist profile in guinea-pig
ileum (buchheit et al., 1995). clarification of why  xxxd3302xxx 
behaves as a partial agonist in these animal tissues and a
full agonist in recombinant cell lines merits investigation.
theoretically, the discrepancy could be a consequence of
differences in receptor reserve, splice variant identity, the
utilization of alternate signalling pathways and/or differential
degrees of receptor desensitization between the two systems.
the possibility that  xxxd3302xxx  interacts with non- xxxg1117xxx 
receptors expressed in animal tissue, thereby influencing the
magnitude of the  xxxg1117xxx  receptor-mediated response, cannot be
excluded.
 xxxd3302xxx  had high affinity (pki ¼ 8.4) for human 5-ht2b
receptors in membranes prepared from cho-k1 cells stably
transfected with 5-ht2b receptors, and significant, although at
least 10-fold lower, affinity for 5-ht2a and 5-ht2c receptors
(pki ¼ 7.5 and 7.0, respectively). it is concluded, therefore, that
 xxxd3302xxx  is not a selective  xxxg1117xxx  ligand, but is rather a mixed
5-ht2b/ xxxg1117xxx  receptor ligand. with respect to its 5-ht2b

functional activity,  xxxd3302xxx  (0.1–3 mm) produced a concentration-dependent inhibition of the 5-ht receptor-mediated
contraction of the rat isolated stomach fundus. a wealth
of data supports the contention that 5-ht-induced contraction
of the rat stomach fundus is mediated via  xxxg1114xxx 
activation (bonhaus et al., 1999). the pa2 value of 8.3
for  xxxd3302xxx  with respect to the antagonism of 5-ht2b
receptor-mediated contraction of the stomach fundus
was consistent with its high binding affinity at the human
 xxxg1114xxx , and similar to its potency for  xxxg1117xxx (c)
receptor-mediated camp accumulation (pec50 ¼ 8.6) in recombinant hek-293 cells, and  xxxg1117xxx -induced relaxation
of the rat isolated oesophagus (pec50 ¼ 8.2), or contraction
of the guinea-pig colon (pec50 ¼ 8.3). in the rat isolated
stomach fundus,  xxxd3302xxx  was associated with an increase
in the 5-ht maximum contraction. it is possible that
 xxxd3302xxx  attenuates the low-affinity, inhibitory response
to 5-ht that exists in the rat stomach fundus (béjar &
malone, 1995), although this proposal requires further
investigation.
following demonstration that  xxxd3302xxx  possessed significant  xxxg1114xxx  antagonist activity in vitro, the interaction of  xxxd3302xxx  with 5-ht2b and  xxxg1117xxx  receptors was
investigated in vivo.  xxxd3302xxx  (1 and 3 mg kg1) produced a
statistically significant,  xxxg1117xxx  receptor-mediated, increase in
colonic transit, relative to its vehicle, in conscious guinea-pigs,
consistent with published data from similar models, with other
 xxxg1117xxx  receptor agonists (inui et al., 2002). the prokinetic
activity of  xxxd3302xxx  was abolished by co-administration of
 xxxd2943xxx  (1 mg kg1). this prokinetic activity of  xxxd3302xxx  is
consistent with the proposed role of 5-ht and  xxxg1117xxx  receptor
activation in promoting gastrointestinal motility in animals
and man (muller-lissner, 1987; nguyen et al., 1997; jin et al.,
1999). in order to establish whether  xxxd3302xxx  possessed 5ht2b receptor antagonist activity in vivo, its effect on 5-ht2b
receptor agonist-evoked contraction of the stomach fundus
was evaluated in anaesthetized rats. subcutaneous administration of  xxxd3302xxx  (0.3 and 1 mg kg1) was associated with an
inhibition of the a-methyl 5-ht or bw 723c86-mediated
contractions. as noted in the in vitro assays, the inhibitory
doses of  xxxd3302xxx  in this in vivo 5-ht2b model were similar to
those required for  xxxg1117xxx  receptor agonist activity of subcutaneously administered  xxxd3302xxx  in terms of colonic
prokinetic activity in guinea-pigs (i.e. a statistically significant
increase in transit at 1 and 3 mg kg1). the sensitivity of the
bw 723c86-mediated stomach contraction to inhibition by sb
206553 was consistent with the proposal that  xxxg1114xxx 
activation is responsible for the contractile response in this in
vivo system. furthermore, unpublished findings from our
group, using the technique of digital sonomicrometry, have
confirmed that  xxxd3302xxx  (in the presence of  xxxd2943xxx ) and sb
206553 inhibit bw 723c86-induced contractions of the rat
stomach fundus in vivo. it is concluded therefore that
 xxxd3302xxx  is a potent  xxxg1114xxx  antagonist in vitro and
in vivo, and its potency in this respect is similar to its  xxxg1117xxx 
agonist potency.
the clinical significance of the interaction of  xxxd3302xxx  with
5-ht2b receptors has yet to be determined. considering that
the in vitro binding affinity of  xxxd3302xxx  for the human 5-ht2b
and  xxxg1117xxx  receptor subtypes is identical (i.e. 4 nm), and
that the maximum steady-state plasma concentration is
approximately 9 nm after oral administration of a 6 mg tablet
british journal of pharmacology vol 143 (5)

5-ht2b antagonist activity of  xxxd3302xxx 

in man (appel-dingemanse et al., 2001), it can be assumed
that 5-ht2b receptors are likely to be occupied by  xxxd3302xxx 
clinically. the functional significance of this  xxxg1114xxx 
interaction will be dependent on the nature and degree
of a physiological or pathophysiological role for 5-ht at this
receptor subtype. rodent studies implicate activation of
5-ht2b receptors in the development of the enteric nervous
system and in the regulation of cardiovascular function
(fiorica-howells et al., 2000; nebigil & maroteaux, 2003).
in 5-ht2b ‘knockout’ mice, impaired cardiac ventricular
contractility and myofibrillar degeneration is observed,
while upon  xxxg1114xxx  overexpression cardiac hypertrophy is evident (nebigil & maroteaux, 2003), although, to
our knowledge, no such studies have investigated the impact
of  xxxg1114xxx  ablation or overexpression on gastrointestinal structure or function. however, it is evident
that mrna for the  xxxg1114xxx  is widely expressed in
the human and rodent gastrointestinal tract (fiorica-howells
et al., 2000; borman et al., 2002). in man,  xxxg1114xxx 
protein is localized in circular and longitudinal muscle layers,
and in myenteric neurones of the colon (borman et al., 2002).
furthermore, exogenously applied 5-ht is associated with a
 xxxg1114xxx -mediated augmentation of neuronally
mediated contraction of human isolated colonic longitudinal
smooth muscle (borman et al., 2002), consistent with intestinal
prokinetic activity in man. it is conceivable that 5-ht2b
receptor antagonism would result in a reduction of gastrointestinal motility and, as has been postulated (borman et al.,
2002), an inhibition of visceral hypersensitivity. potentially,
 xxxg1114xxx  antagonist, rather than  xxxg1117xxx  agonist,
activity of  xxxd3302xxx  is responsible for its ability to alleviate
abdominal pain and discomfort in patients with ibs. however, if  xxxg1114xxx  antagonism reduces gastrointestinal
motility in man, this may limit the  xxxg1117xxx  receptor-mediated
clinical prokinetic activity of  xxxd3302xxx . the observation,
in this study, that  xxxd3302xxx , in the presence of  xxxd2943xxx ,
failed to slow colonic transit in comparison to
vehicle treatment, was consistent with a lack of evidence
indicating a role for the  xxxg1114xxx  in guinea-pig colonic
function. it remains to be determined how important the
 xxxg1114xxx  antagonist activity of  xxxd3302xxx  is in humans.
it is unfortunate that the development of  xxxd3039xxx , a
 xxxg1117xxx  receptor agonist with at least 300-fold selectivity over
the  xxxg1114xxx  subtype (briejer et al., 2001), was
suspended before its clinical prokinetic activity could be
compared directly to that of  xxxd3302xxx . a comparison of
the clinical efficacy data for  xxxd3302xxx  and  xxxd1708xxx  is
uninformative as, in addition to its  xxxg1117xxx  receptor agonist
activity,  xxxd1708xxx  has significant affinity at 5-ht3, 5-ht2a and
5-ht2b receptors (nemeth & gullikson, 1989; prins et al.,
1997; theravance inc., unpublished observations). future
clinical studies, using novel  xxxg1117xxx  receptor agonists, should
elucidate whether or not a compound with greater  xxxg1117xxx 
receptor selectivity than  xxxd3302xxx  will be associated with
improved efficacy in disorders of reduced gastrointestinal
motility.
