abstract
introduction: in this study, we examined the
effects of the alpha-glucosidase inhibitors acarbose
and  xxxd3524xxx  on postprandial plasma glucose
and serum triglyceride levels in patients with
type 2 diabetes mellitus. methods: twenty-one
japanese patients with type 2 diabetes were
enrolled in this study. subjects had been
treated with  xxxd3524xxx  for at least 3 months.
they underwent a 400 kcal balanced food
meal tolerance test before and 8 weeks after
the changeover from  xxxd3524xxx  to acarbose.
subjects were divided into two groups: the ﬁrst
group (low-dose group; n=11) was changed
over from 0.6 mg/day  xxxd3524xxx  to 150 mg/day
acarbose, and the other (high-dose group; n=10)
from 0.9 mg/day  xxxd3524xxx  to 300 mg/day
acarbose. results: the increment rate of postprandial plasma glucose ([plasma glucose

25.0%±24.6% (p=0.13) in the low-dose group,
and decreased signiﬁcantly from 56.1%±53.1%
to 31.5%±36.0% (p=0.03) in the high-dose
group after changeover. however, there were
no signiﬁcant changes in blood glycated hemoglobin (hba1c) levels before and after changeover in either group. the increment rate of
postprandial serum triglyceride (tg) ([serum
tg 2 hours after test meal – fasting tg]/fasting
tg) decreased signiﬁcantly only in the highdose group (52.4%±60.0% to 24.3%±16.6%)
(p=0.05). no significant changes in serum
high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels
were observed in either group, whereas serum
low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels
decreased significantly from 3.20±0.25 to
2.65±0.18 mmol/l (p=0.04), only in the highdose group. conclusion: in patients with type 2
diabetes our findings suggest that acarbose
300 mg/day is superior to  xxxd3524xxx  0.9 mg/day
in improving postprandial hyperglycemia
and hypertriglyceridemia.

introduction
several studies have conﬁrmed that a high
postprandial glucose level is a greater risk factor
for atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease
than high fasting glucose levels in individuals
with both impaired glucose tolerance and diabetes.1-3 the mechanism by which a sudden postprandial increase in glucose, or “glucose spike,”
increases the risk of cardiovascular events, is
thought to be acceleration of vascular oxidative
stress that inhibits the vascular endothelium,
resulting in progression of atherosclerosis.4
in addition, hyperlipidemia is a major risk
factor for cardiovascular disease, and type 2 diabetes patients frequently have abnormalities of
lipid metabolism resulting in atherosclerotic
vascular disease.5 a recent study demonstrated
that postprandial hyperlipidemia is a major risk
factor for coronary artery disease.6 in type 2
diabetes patients, treatment of not only postprandial hyperglycemia but also postprandial hyperlipidemia may be very important
to inhibit the progression of atherosclerotic
vascular disease.
alpha-glucosidase inhibitors (alpha-gi), which
lower postprandial plasma glucose by delaying
the absorption of sugars from the digestive system, are used widely as monotherapy or in combination with other antidiabetic treatments.7-10
however, there has been some variability of
clinical effects of alpha-gis in diabetes patients and
healthy subjects.11,12 some differences have also
been reported in the degree of improvement in
postprandial plasma glucose between two alpha-gis,
acarbose and  xxxd3524xxx , although the ﬁndings
have been inconsistent.13,14 slight differences
are also seen in the degree of inhibition of
intestinal enzymes.15
there have also been several reports that alpha-gis
not only improve postprandial glucose, but also
have favorable effects on lipid metabolism.16,17

661

recent studies have demonstrated that acarbose
improves lipid metabolism, lowering low-density
lipoprotein cholesterol (ldl-c) levels, raising
high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (hdl-c)
levels,18 and lowering preprandial triglyceride
(tg) levels.17 there have been few studies directly
comparing the effects of acarbose and  xxxd3524xxx 
treatment on postprandial triglycerides directly.
in this study, we examined the effects of two
alpha-gis on postprandial glucose and lipid metabolism in a changeover study from  xxxd3524xxx 
to acarbose.

materials and methods
study population
we enrolled 21 patients attending dokkyo
medical university hospital with type 2 diabetes
and glycated hemoglobin (hba1c) >6.5%, who had
been on  xxxd3524xxx  treatment for at least 3 months,
and who met the following eligibility criteria:
(1) fasting serum tg <1.71 mmol/l; (2) serum
creatinine <2.0 mg/dl; (3) hba1c <9.0%; (4) no
concomitant use of ﬁbrates, thyroid hormone,
or corticosteroids hormone; (5) no changes in
medications during the previous 3 months;
(6) not receiving advice for lifestyle at changeover; (7) outpatients. we also excluded potential
subjects with a history of stroke or other cardiovascular event. concomitant treatments were
stable and maintained unchanged as much as
possible throughout the study period. all subjects gave informed consent to participate in
this study. this study was performed according
to the declaration of helsinki guidelines.
subjects were divided into two groups: the ﬁrst
group (low-dose group) was changed over from
0.6 mg/day  xxxd3524xxx  to 150 mg/day acarbose
(n=11), and the other (high-dose group) from
0.9 mg/day  xxxd3524xxx  to 300 mg/day acarbose
(n=10). no changes were made in other hypo-

glycemic, antihypertensive, or lipid-lowering
medications during the study.
study design
the patients received a balanced food meal
tolerance test (calorie mate block, otsuka
pharmaceutical co. ltd, tokyo, japan) containing 400 kcal with 41.7g of carbohydrate, 8.2g
of protein, and 22.2g of fat, immediately after
taking 0.2 or 0.3 mg  xxxd3524xxx  (low- and highdose groups, respectively). subjects were then
changed over to acarbose. after 8 weeks of acarbose treatment, the same meal tolerance test was
carried out after administration of 50 or 100 mg
acarbose (low- and high-dose groups, respectively). we measured fasting and 2-hour postprandial levels of plasma glucose and tg. hba1c,
serum imunoreactive insulin (iri), ldl-c, and
hdl-c at fasting level were measured. plasma
glucose was measured by the glucose oxidase
method (medca japan, konosu, japan). serum
tg was measured by the free glycerol reductase method using glycerol kinase and lipoprotein kinase (roche diagnostics co. ltd.,
tokyo, japan).19 serum hdl-c was measured by
a direct method using cholesterol oxidase and
 xxxg428xxx  (daiichi pure chemicals co.
ltd., tokyo, japan). serum ldl-c was calculated using friedewald’s equation.20 hba1c levels
were determined using high-performance liquid
chromatography (hplc: hi-autoa1c, ha8150,
arkray inc., kyoto, japan). iri was measured by
enzyme immunometric assay with the e-test
tosoh ii (tosoh co. ltd., tokyo, japan).

unpaired t test or mann-whitney u test for continuous variables, and the chi2-test or fisher test
for qualitative variables. two-tailed p values of
<0.05 were considered signiﬁcant.

results
twenty-one patients with type 2 diabetes
were enrolled in the study. patient characteristics are shown in table 1. no signiﬁcant differences in any parameters at baseline were seen
between the two groups.
changes in plasma glucose metabolism
no signiﬁcant changes were seen in fasting
plasma glucose levels in either the low-dose
(130.2±7.4 to 126.9±4.5 mg/dl) (p=0.48) or highdose group (135.2±10.1 to 147.6±13.1 mg/dl)
(p=0.21). postprandial plasma glucose (2 hours
after meal tolerance test) was not signiﬁcantly
decreased in either the low-dose (173.0±11.2 to
156.2±5.7 mg/dl) (p=0.11) or high-dose group
(196.4±12.5 to 182.9±9.6 mg/dl) (p=0.29)
(table 2).
the increment rate of postprandial plasma
glucose ([plasma glucose 2 hours after test meal
– fasting glucose]/fasting glucose) decreased
from 34.7%±23.9% to 25.0%±24.6% (p=0.13) in
the low-dose group, and decreased signiﬁcantly
from 56.1%±53.1% to 31.5%±36.0% (p=0.03) in
the high-dose group (figure 1a). no signiﬁcant
changes in blood hba1c or fasting plasma iri
levels were observed in either group (table 2).

the low-dose (1.77±0.20 to 1.85±0.25 mmol/l)
(p=0.74) or high-dose group (1.61±0.30 to
1.36±0.22 mmol/l) (p=0.06) (table 2).
the increment rate of postprandial serum tg
([serum tg 2 hours after test meal – fasting tg]/
fasting tg) increased from 32.1%±20.5% to
37.3%±19.3% (p=0.46) in the low-dose group,
but decreased signiﬁcantly from 52.4%±60.0%
to 24.3%±16.6% (p=0.05) in the high-dose group
(figure 1b).

there was no signiﬁcant correlation between
the postprandial tg levels and the parameters at
baseline such as gender, age, body weight, blood
pressure, medication, hba1c, fasting and postprandial blood glucose, and iri by pearson’s correlation coefﬁcient analysis (data not shown).
no signiﬁcant changes in serum hdl-c were
observed in either the low-dose (1.38±0.10 to
1.42±0.09 mmol/l) (p=0.54) or high-dose group
(1.55±0.19 to 1.58±0.17 mmol/l) (p=0.21).
however, serum ldl-c changed minimally
from 2.77±0.32 to 2.79±0.29 mmol/l (p=0.87)
in the low-dose group, and decreased signiﬁcantly from 3.20±0.25 to 2.65±0.18 mmol/l
(p=0.04) in the high-dose group (table 2).
safety
there were no reported adverse reactions,
such as gastrointestinal upsets or liver dysfunction, during this study.

discussion
in this study, we compared the effects of
two alpha-gis at high dosages (0.9 mg  xxxd3524xxx 
and 300 mg acarbose daily) and low dosages
(0.6 mg  xxxd3524xxx  and 150 mg acarbose daily)
in a  xxxd3524xxx -to-acarbose changeover study.
our ﬁndings demonstrated greater efﬁcacy for
300 mg/day acarbose than 0.9 mg/day  xxxd3524xxx  in reducing postprandial hyperglycemia
and hypertriglyceridemia.
no signiﬁcant differences were seen in postprandial glucose levels between 300 mg/day acarbose and 0.9 mg/day  xxxd3524xxx , although when
the incremental ratio of postprandial glucose
levels were analyzed, acarbose 300 mg/day
reduced the increment ratio of postprandial
glucose significantly more than  xxxd3524xxx 
0.9 mg/day. few studies have compared these
two alpha-gis directly. fujisawa et al. reported that

50 mg acarbose and 0.3 mg  xxxd3524xxx  had similar effects on postprandial hyperglycemia in a
crossover study of the two agents for a couple
of days.13 in our study,  xxxd3524xxx  had already
been administered for more than 3 months,
and acarbose was administered for 2 months
after changeover, so we were able to observe
long-term effects of these alpha-gis.
our ﬁndings also showed that the incremental ratio of serum tg in the high-dose group

was signiﬁcantly decreased by changeover from
 xxxd3524xxx  to acarbose treatment. this improvement of tg was independent of glucose control. it could be possible that the glucose control
of subjects was already good at the changeover
because of pretreatment by  xxxd3524xxx . ogawa et
al. reported that acarbose lowered postprandial
tg and chylomicron levels in type 2 diabetes
patients.21 moreover, kado et al. reported that
acarbose reduced postprandial tg and remnant-

like particle cholesterol levels in type 2 diabetes
patients.16 kawamura showed that the effects of
acarbose on lipid metabolism are unrelated to the
degree of glycemic control.17 there have, however,
been no studies directly comparing the effects
on lipid metabolism of acarbose and  xxxd3524xxx .
although our study used a changeover design, our
results suggested that acarbose 300 mg/day was
more effective in reducing postprandial serum
tg levels than  xxxd3524xxx  0.9 mg/day. this result
is consistent with an earlier study that showed
reductions in ldl-c with long-term treatment
with acarbose 300 mg/day.22
acarbose reduces postprandial tg by lowering postprandial chylomicron levels20 and postprandial remnant-like particle cholesterol. 16
acarbose inhibits not only  xxxg1401xxx , alpha-dextrinase,
and sucrase, but also alpha-amylase, while  xxxd3524xxx 
does not have an inhibition effect of alpha-amylase.
inhibition of alpha-amylase results in increased glycosaminoglycans, changes in the intestinal ﬂora,
and increased production of short-chain fatty
acids in the digestive tract,23 and these factors
likely affect lipid metabolism.
this study has some limitations. first, the
study subjects were heterogeneous and the
number was relatively small; not large enough
to lend sufﬁcient power to the results. second,
despite the fact that serum tg levels could
reach a peak more than 4 hours postprandially,
only 2-hour postprandial serum tg levels were
observed in this study. third, the possibility
cannot be ruled out that  xxxg1060xxx 
inhibitors or antihypertensive agents, such as
renin-angiotensin blockers, affected the changes
in lipid proﬁles observed in this study. further
studies are needed to clarify these points.
in conclusion, our findings suggest that
acarbose 300 mg/day is superior to  xxxd3524xxx 
0.9 mg/day treatment in improving postprandial hyperglycemia and hypertriglyceridemia in
patients with type 2 diabetes.
