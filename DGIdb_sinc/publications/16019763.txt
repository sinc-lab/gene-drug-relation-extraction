abstract
although intravesical chemotherapy has been used in the management of superficial bladder cancer for some decades, until
recently there has been little or no progress in the search for new agents. however, in the past few years there have been
developments of investigational drugs that may play a future role in this indication. this review highlights the mode of
action, indications, dose and administration, efficacy, safety and significance of new chemotherapeutic agents such as
intravesical  xxxd3486xxx , gemcitabine,  xxxd3266xxx , g- xxxd2490xxx , eflornithine ( xxxd1972xxx ),  xxxd3381xxx  ( xxxd3381xxx ), fenritinide and
celecoxib. although the initial results achieved with these agents in clinical development seem encouraging, long-term data
on the prevention of recurrence, disease progression and survival have yet to be obtained.

introduction
in europe, cancer of the bladder is the fourth most
frequent cancer among men, accounting for :/7) of
total cancers. there are an estimated 136 300 new
cases each year. the annual incidence rate is
32u100 000 in men and 9u100 000 in women, while
the annual mortality rate is 9u100 000 (11u100 000
for men, 4u100 000 for women). in men, the annual
incidence rises rapidly with age from 1u100 000 in
patients aged b/45 years to 25u100 000 in the age
group 45 /64 years. thereafter it increases at a
reduced rate (87 per 100 000uyear for ages 65 /74
and 129 per 100 000uyear for those older than 75
years of age). there were :/49 000 deaths from
bladder cancer in europe [1].
in europe, during the period 1990 /94 the relative
5-year survival rate after diagnosis of cancer of the
bladder was 69) (70) in men, 67) in women).
five-year relative survival decreased markedly with
age from 90) for the youngest age group (15 /45
years) to 61) for the oldest age group ( ]/75 years).
there are major differences between european
countries in terms of the survival of patients with
bladder cancer. some eastern european countries
such as poland, estonia and slovenia have low
5-year relative survival rates (b/45)). in northern

(sweden, finland and norway) and central (germany, austria and the netherlands) european
countries, survival has generally been higher
( /70)) [2]. in general, the incidence of bladder
cancer is either rising moderately or remaining stable
in most developed countries, despite improvements
in diagnostic and therapeutic interventions as well as
greater awareness of important risk factors such as
cigarette smoking and occupational chemical exposure [3]. in the majority of patients with superficial
bladder cancer, the tumors can be resected; however,
despite complete tumor resection, up to two-thirds of
patients will develop tumor recurrence within 5 years
[4]. in selected cases, the risk of progression to a
muscle-invasive tumor is as high as 50 /80) [5,6].
the time to progression to muscle-invasive disease is
still largely unpredictable because of the multifocal
nature of the disease and the heterogeneity of the
tumors. as many as 20) of patients with diffuse
tumor in situ (tis) and as many as 10) with only
focal tis are found to have evidence of muscle
invasion or occult regional metastases, respectively
on final pathologic examination when ultimately
treated with radical cystectomy [7].
tumor recurrence and potential progression provide reasons to institute adjuvant topical therapy.

intravesical chemotherapy of superficial bladder cancer
since its introduction in the late 1950s, intravesical
therapy has been used in the management of nonmuscle-invasive bladder cancer with three specific
goals: (i) eradicating residual tumor; (ii) preventing
recurrence of tumor after complete bladder tumor
resection; and (iii) preventing progression of disease.
the suspected biologic behavior of the patient’s
tumor remains an important determining factor in
the decision to institute intravesical therapy. in the
absence of risk factors for progression, intravesical
therapy is not required for ta g1 lesions, which have
a progression rate of only 2 /4) [8]. however,
multifocal ta disease, irrespective of grade, is a
relative indication for intravesical therapy because
it is associated with an increased risk of tumor
recurrence and progression [9]. the presence of
even small foci of tis should be considered a definite
indication for intravesical therapy. other relative
indications for intravesical therapy include low-grade
ta disease recurring within 2 years, persistent
positive urine cytology localized to the bladder or
severe atypia [10]. prostatic urethral involvement
with tis is associated with a high risk of progression
and a poor prognosis and should be treated aggressively.
for intravesical therapy in general there are two
principal approaches: either biological therapies
employing immunologically active agents; or chemotherapeutic agents, which are described herein.
this review highlights the mode of action, indications, dose and administration, efficacy, safety and
significance of new chemotherapeutic agents such
as intravesical  xxxd3486xxx , gemcitabine,  xxxd3266xxx , glinolenic acid, eflornithine ( xxxd1972xxx ),  xxxd3381xxx 
( xxxd3381xxx ), fenritinide and celecoxib.

chemotherapeutic agents
 xxxd3486xxx  ( xxxd3486xxx )
 xxxd3486xxx  ( xxxd3486xxx )
is a semi-synthetic derivative of the anthracycline
doxorubicin. the substance is characterized by two
crucial substitutions on the doxorubicin molecule: a
five-carbon, straight-chain valerate ester replaces the
hydroxyl group of doxorubicin on the c14 chain;
and an additional tri-fluoroacetyl group is present on
the amino group of the carbohydrate ring.  xxxd3486xxx 
has a more rapid uptake into cancer cells than
doxorubicin and lacks the high level of preferential
negative ion binding in cell membranes thought to
be responsible for the cardiac, mucosal and skin
contact toxicity associated with doxorubicin.  xxxd3486xxx  inhibits the incorporation of nucleosides into
nucleic acids, causing extensive chromosomal damage and cell-cycle arrest in the g2 phase. its

109

principal metabolites inhibit  xxxg2312xxx , thus
arresting dna synthesis. the toxicity of  xxxd3486xxx 
appears to be limited to local cystitis. to date, there
have been no cases of progressive bladder contracture, as have been seen with the other anthracylines
used intravesically. in addition,  xxxd3486xxx  is a
macromolecule, which significantly limits its systemic absorption and accounts for its lack of
systemic toxicity [11,12].
 xxxd3486xxx  ( xxxd3486xxx † ) is approved in the us for
intravesical use in patients who are unresponsive to
standard bacillus calmette/guérin (bcg) intravesical therapy, but who are not candidates for
cystectomy and urinary diversion.  xxxd3486xxx  has
been studied in several phase ii settings. a compilation of clinical studies performed with  xxxd3486xxx  is
shown in table i [11 /16]. taken together,  xxxd3486xxx  prevented or delayed recurrence (mean time to
recurrence was 248 days) of tumors in previously
treated refractory superficial transitional cell carcinoma (tcc). furthermore, it was shown that
patients who developed progressive disease after
intravesical  xxxd3486xxx  therapy did so early, within 6
months of starting therapy.
steinberg et al. [15] assessed the efficacy and
safety of intravesical  xxxd3486xxx  for the treatment of
tis in patients with failure or recurrence after bcg
therapy who otherwise would have undergone cystectomy. the authors reported recurrence in 79
patients, including only two with clinically advanced
disease (stage t2). of the 79 patients, 44 (56); four
responders, 40 non-responders) underwent radical
cystectomy. of the 41 patients with known pathological stage, six (15)) had stage  xxxd2923xxx  or greater at
cystectomy. four patients died of bladder cancer
during the median follow-up period of 30 months,
none of whom was a complete responder or underwent cystectomy following  xxxd3486xxx  treatment. the
main side-effects of  xxxd3486xxx  therapy were reversible local bladder symptoms.
unfortunately,  xxxd3486xxx , formerly distributed by
celltech inc., has not been available for some time
and, according to the manufacturer, this situation is
unlikely to change in the foreseeable future.
gemcitabine
gemcitabine (difluorodeoxycytidine), an analog of
 xxxd1790xxx  ( xxxd1790xxx ), is a pyrimidine antimetabolite. the mechanism of action of gemcitabine
has been well characterized. it is deaminated intracellularly by  xxxd1836xxx  deaminase to difluorodeoxyuridine or activated by  xxxg611xxx  to
difluorodeoxycytidine monophosphate (dfdcmp).
difluorodeoxyuridine is inactive, while dfdcmp
is further metabolized to difluorodeoxycytidine

into dna, results in chain termination. in addition,
gemcitabine inhibits ribonucleotide reductase, an
enzyme that produces deoxynucleotides that are
required for dna synthesis [17,18]. gemcitabine

intravesical chemotherapy of superficial bladder cancer

 xxxd3266xxx  is a polysulfonated naphthylurea that inhibits proliferation and dna synthesis. the compound has been available since the 1920s; bayer
originally marketed it as an antiparasitic. however,
in vitro studies demonstrated significant efficacy of
 xxxd3266xxx  against tcc cell lines at relatively low
doses [23]. its large molecular size and negative
charge inhibit bladder absorption, suggesting it as an
excellent candidate for intravesical chemotherapy.
 xxxd3266xxx  has been shown to block the binding of
 xxxg681xxx  (egf) to its receptors.
because a significant association has been found
between the number of egf receptors on a bladder
cancer cell and its sensitivity to  xxxd3266xxx , tcc is
potentially responsive to such therapy [24]. intravesical  xxxd3266xxx  was evaluated in a phase i study in
order to define its dose-limiting toxicity and systemic
absorption, determine a starting dose and regimen
for phase ii studies and provide a preliminary
assessment of in vivo antitumor activity. intravesical
 xxxd3266xxx  treatment was administered in nine patients
with histologically identified tcc (tis, ta or t1)
in whom at least one course of standard intravesical
chemotherapy (bcg,  xxxd3358xxx  or  xxxd2655xxx )
had failed.  xxxd3266xxx  was administered once weekly
for 6 weeks. patients were treated in groups of three
with an intrapatient dose escalation schedule.
 xxxd3266xxx  doses of 0.3 /614.4 mguml were administered intravesically. the last group was treated with
the same weekly dose for 6 weeks. the dose
escalation phase was limited by the solubility of
 xxxd3266xxx  in solution. complications included bladder
spasms in 4u54 treatments (7)) and new or worsening vesicoureteral reflux in three patients (17)). at
follow-up, seven patients had stage ta tumors and
two had tis. an intravesical  xxxd3266xxx  dose of 153
mguml was defined as safe, with acceptable plasma

eflornithine ( xxxd2430xxx )
a- xxxd2430xxx  ( xxxd1972xxx ) is an irreversible inhibitor of  xxxg1626xxx  (odc), the
key enzyme in mammalian polyamine biosynthesis.
levels of odc are closely related to tumor promotion, and inhibition of odc is associated with
suppression of tumor development in laboratory
animals. in vitro, human tcc cell lines tested
were sensitive to  xxxd1972xxx , requiring 5/1.0 mm
 xxxd1972xxx  [29].  xxxd1972xxx  was examined for its ability
to suppress the development of invasive urinary
bladder carcinoma in c3huhe male mice. continuous administration of 0.2)  xxxd1972xxx  in water
following carcinogen treatment [0.05) n-butyl-n(4-hydroxybutyl) nitrosamine in drinking water for 8
weeks] was effective in suppressing urinary bladder
carcinomas [30]. there have been multiple reports
indicating a chemopreventive effect of  xxxd1972xxx  in (rat
and mice) bladder carcinogenesis [31 /34]. ilex
oncology (san antonio, tx) recently completed
recruitment to a double-blind phase iii trial of
eflornithine in 450 patients with low-grade superficial bladder cancer. this randomized, placebocontrolled trial will evaluate the ability of eflornithine

113

to prevent recurrence of cancer in patients who have
already had surgery to remove their superficial
bladder cancer lesions. final efficacy results were
expected in 2003. in two separate interim safety
analyses of the trial conducted in summer 2001 and
spring 2002, an independent data safety monitoring
board recommended that the trial should continue.
meanwhile, ilex’s application for orphan drug

is pending with the food and drug administration

 xxxd3381xxx  ( xxxd3381xxx )
janssen is developing  xxxd3381xxx  ( xxxd3381xxx † , formerly known as  xxxd3381xxx ), an inhibitor of ras
farnesylation, for the potential treatment of neoplasia.  xxxd3381xxx , (r)-6-amino[(4-chlorophenyl)(1methyl-1h-imidazol-5-yl)methyl]-4-(3-chlorophenyl)-1-methyl-2(1h)-quinolinone, is a potent and
selective inhibitor of farnesyl protein transferase with
significant antitumor effects in vivo subsequent to
oral administration in mice. ras oncogenes (k-, hand  xxxg1605xxx ) are known to be involved in signal
transduction pathways regulating cell growth and
differentiation in many human cancers. this process
is initiated by the attachment of a farnesyl moiety to
the protein and is catalyzed by farnesyl transferase.
as activated (mutated) ras oncogenes have been
shown to be essential for the malignant phenotype in
many tumors, farnesyl transferase inhibitors have
emerged as a novel class of antineoplastic agents
[35,36]. a phase ii study of  xxxd3381xxx  in patients
with recurrent superficial tcc of the bladder is
ongoing. patients receive oral  xxxd3381xxx  twice daily
on days 1 /21. treatment is repeated every 28 days
for up to 12 courses in the absence of disease
progression or unacceptable toxicity (protocol id:
pmh-phl-007, nci-5612).
 xxxd2099xxx 
retinoids are a class of chemical compounds that
include active metabolites of  xxxd3105xxx  (retinol), as
well as a diverse array of synthetic derivatives.
retinoids have been shown to modulate a wide
variety of cellular processes, including proliferation,
differentiation, homeostasis, malignant transformation and apoptosis [37]. retinoids also act pharmacologically to restore regulation of differentiation
and growth in certain premalignant and malignant
cells both in vitro and in vivo. several retinoid
analogs have shown chemopreventive activity in rat
and murine bladder carcinogenesis models, presumably by restoring the normal differentiation state of
premalignant and malignant cells [38].

 xxxd2099xxx , or  xxxd2099xxx , is a promising retinoid for
chemoprevention. pilot studies in bladder cancer
demonstrated its feasibility [39,40]. ninety-nine
patients with resected superficial bladder cancer
(pta, pt1) were randomized to either  xxxd2099xxx 
(200 mguday p.o. for 24 months) or no intervention.
the primary study endpoint was the proportion of
dna aneuploid histograms, the hyperdiploid fraction and the percentage of apoptotic cells after 12
months. there were no differences in response
biomarkers between the two groups up to 36
months, nor was any biomarker able to predict the
risk of recurrence. recurrence-free survival was
comparable between the two arms (27 events in
the  xxxd2099xxx  arm versus 21 in the control arm; p /
0.36). twelve subjects in the  xxxd2099xxx  arm complained of diminished dark adaptability, and nine
subjects in the  xxxd2099xxx  arm and one in the control
arm had mild dermatological alterations [41].
a national cancer institute-sponsored multicenter phase iii trial of  xxxd2099xxx  in the prevention of
superficial bladder cancer is ongoing. patients receive either oral  xxxd2099xxx  or placebo on days 1 /
25. the course is repeated every 28 days for up to 1
year in the absence of disease progression or
unacceptable toxicity (protocol id: mda-id95236, nci- xxxg99xxx -1621).
celecoxib
celecoxib, a specific  xxxg1884xxx  inhibitor, was
evaluated in two rodent models of urinary bladder
cancer. male b6d2f1 mice treated with n-butyl-n(4-hydroxybutyl)-nitrosamine (oh-bbn) developed
transitional cell urinary bladder cancers, and received various daily doses of celecoxib in the diet
(1250, 500 or 200 mgukg of diet) beginning 7 days
before the initiation of 12 weekly doses of oh-bbn.
the proportion of mice with large palpable bladder
lesions, which necessitated sacrifice of the mice, was
40) in the oh-bbn control group. in contrast,
only 10) of all celecoxib-treated mice required
sacrifice before the scheduled termination of the
experiment, implying that all three doses of celecoxib
inhibited the formation of large lesions. celecoxib
did not significantly alter the incidence of preneoplastic bladder lesions, but did dose-dependently
decrease the total number of urinary bladder cancers, by 77), 57) and 43) at dosages of 1250, 500
and 200 mgukg of diet, respectively. in the second
model, female fischer-344 rats were administered
oh-bbn twice per week for a period of 8 weeks.
rats were continually treated with celecoxib in the
diet (500 or 1000 mgukg), beginning either 1 week
prior to the initial oh-bbn treatment or 1 week
following the last oh-bbn treatment. neither

celecoxib treatment regimen significantly altered
the number of preneoplastic lesions. whereas celecoxib treatment initiated prior to oh-bbn administration decreased cancer incidence by :/65),
celecoxib treatment initiated 1 week after the last
dose of oh-bbn profoundly decreased cancer
incidence (by /95)). celecoxib did not cause
toxicity at any of the doses studied [42].
presently, a phase iibuiii randomized chemoprevention study is comparing the time to recurrence
following treatment with celecoxib versus placebo in
patients with superficial tcc of the bladder at high
risk of recurrence (protocol id: mda-id-99368,
nci-p00-0165, sc-nq4-99-02-006).
discussion
the general aims of intravesical therapy are the
prevention of tumor progression and therefore the
prevention of radical cystectomy, the prevention or
retardation of tumor recurrence, the eradication of
residual unresectable (papillary) tumor anduor tis
and, last but not least, the prolongation of a good
quality of life. however, the protocols and endpoints
chosen for studies of new bladder cancer therapies
often make the interpretation of data difficult, for the
following reasons:
1. patients with papillary tumors, superficial invasive tumors and carcinoma in situ are placed
in the same group, although the biological
behavior of the tumors and the risk of tumor
progression can be very different.
2. in some analyses, patients with primary and
recurrent bladder tumors are combined, without stratification of this parameter.
3. some authors fail to calculate recurrence rates
from specified endpoints, e.g. 1 or 2 years posttransurethral resection (tur).
4. there is a failure to consider the many potential
variables involved in intravesical therapy, including drug concentrations, exposure period,
volume of instillate, nature of solvent, ph and
osmolality.
the dose and concentrations used in the studies are
often empirically derived and rarely tested systematically. a further unanswered question is when to
start the instillation therapy. a broad range of
alternatives, from 12 h to 8 weeks after transurethral
resection, have been applied, but are mostly empirically derived. presently, many urologists advocate
starting therapy with chemotherapeutic agents immediately after surgery. indeed, the perioperative
instillation of, for example,  xxxd2655xxx  is performed frequently.

intravesical chemotherapy of superficial bladder cancer
in many phase ii trials in superficial bladder
cancer, marker lesions have been used to test the
ablative activity of intravesical chemo- or immunotherapy. the rationale behind the marker lesion
study design presupposes that the potential biological behavior of a papillary, non-muscle-invasive
tumor can be controlled. therefore, such a study
will provide important knowledge about drug activity and toxicity without exposing hundreds of
patients in phase iii trials to drugs which ultimately
may not be successful in preventing tumor recurrence or progression. a study by oosterlinck et al.
[43] in patients with ta /t1, g1 g2 papillary
superficial bladder tumors demonstrated that, in
the absence of any visual tumors, tur and deep
biopsy at the site of the scar of the marker lesion only
rarely (3u110) revealed the histological presence of a
persisting tumor.
a comprehensive review of the literature by the
american urological association bladder cancer
clinical guidelines panel [44] found that only
181u5712 articles examined met minimum criteria,
which included a study design involving the randomization of patients and an appropriate control
group for inclusion in data analysis and extraction.
many negative studies did not have sufficient statistical power to identify differences in progression,
further emphasizing the need to focus future evaluations on specific subgroups of superficial bladder
cancer patients who are at the highest risk of
experiencing adverse outcomes. when interpreting
results the accuracy of endpoints is contingent upon
the understanding of a disease, both at its initial
presentation and in terms of its ultimate capabilities.
although several new agents have been evaluated
in phase i and ii studies, and some results of these
newer chemotherapeutic therapies seem encouraging, long-term data on the prevention of recurrence, disease progression and survival have not yet
been obtained. major drawbacks remain, such as
poor study design and the lack of minimum criteria
for conducting successful and comparable studies.
unfortunately,  xxxd3486xxx , the drug approved by the
fda for refractory superficial bladder cancer, is
presently not available for further evaluation. intravesical gemcitabine will be of clinical interest: phase
i trials showed that intravesical application is well
tolerated, with minimal systemic absorption and
toxicity, but few data are available showing its
efficacy in tumor recurrence. additionally, all new
chemotherapeutic agents need to be measured
against the existing standards of intravesical therapy
with bcg or ‘‘traditional’’ chemotherapeutic agents
such as  xxxd2655xxx .
