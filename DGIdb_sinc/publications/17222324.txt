objectives:

sleep difficulty is common in minimal hepatic encephalopathy (he) and the mechanisms are not
fully elucidated. dysregulated histamine neurotransmission is associated with an altered circadian
rhythmicity that is partially restored following central  xxxg1078xxx  blockade in cirrhotic
animals. we studied the effects of the histamine h1 blocker hydroxyzine in sleep alterations in
patients with cirrhosis in a double-blind, randomized controlled fashion.

methods:

a total of 35 patients (age 56 yr [36–69], pugh’s score 9 [7–12], portosystemic shunt: n = 7) with
minimal he and long-standing sleep difficulties (8 months [4–48]) and free from benzodiazepines
were randomized to hydroxyzine 25 mg at bedtime (n = 17) or placebo (n = 18) for a 10-day period.
measurements of sleep behavior using visual analog scale and wrist actigraphy, neuropsychological
tests, and protein  xxxg2007xxx  serum levels were performed at baseline and at day 10.

results:

subjective improvement in sleep was observed in 40% of hydroxyzine-treated patients but in none
receiving placebo (p < 0.04). objectively, 65% of hydroxyzine-treated patients versus 25% of
patients under placebo had a ≥30% increase in sleep efficiency as measured by wrist actigraphy
(p < 0.04). neuropsychological tests (z scores) and protein  xxxg2007xxx  levels remained statistically
unchanged in both groups. one patient developed an acute episode of encephalopathy reversible
upon cessation of hydroxyzine.

conclusions: in contrast to placebo, hydroxyzine 25 mg at bedtime improved sleep behavior (subjectively and
using wrist actigraphy) in patients with cirrhosis and minimal he. the risk of precipitating overt he
warrants some caution when prescribing this drug.

introduction

level, a brain hormone with a role of circadian pacemaker, is
altered with a delayed peak at night time (6). second, an increase in the degree of portal-systemic shunting following the
placement of a transjugular intrahepatic stent shunt (tips) is
associated with a transient increase in sleep disorders (2).
third, itching (7), frequently reported in cholestatic liver diseases, may be an important cause of sleep difficulties in these
patients. finally, recent experimental (8) and human postmortem (9, 10) studies demonstrated a dysregulation in brain
histamine, a neurotransmitter system involved in the modulation of sleep–wake cycle (11). in portocaval-shunted animals, administration of the histamine h1 blocker  xxxd3050xxx 
improved circadian rhythmicity of locomotion and feeding
(12), suggesting this dysregulated brain neurotransmitter system could be influenced by a centrally acting pharmacological
agent.
in patients with cirrhosis, the use of an antihistamine to
treat sleep difficulties has never been tested so far. thus,
in view of the dysregulated brain histaminergic system in

patients with cirrhosis often complain of sleep difficulties.
in a recent study on patients without clinical evidence of
hepatic encephalopathy (he), the prevalence of sleep disturbances was almost 50% (1), as compared with 15% in the general population (2). such an unsatisfactory sleep, manifest as
delayed bedtime, fragmented nocturnal sleep with frequent
awakenings resulting in reduced sleeping time, sometimes
reaching a complete inversion in the sleep–wake pattern, is
considered an early sign of he (3) and negatively affects the
quality of life of patients with cirrhosis (4). management of
sleep difficulties in these patients is problematic; benzodiazepines are often ineffective and potentially dangerous as
they may precipitate hepatic coma. thus, according to recently published practice guidelines (5), they should not be
administered to patients with cirrhosis.
sleep disturbances in cirrhosis are probably multifactorial. first, the rhythm of production of melatonin plasma

cirrhosis, we examined the effects of the centrally acting histamine h1 blocker hydroxyzine on sleep alterations in patients with cirrhosis, in a double-blind, randomized controlled
fashion.

patients
in our tertiary care hospital and reference center for liver diseases, we observed during a time period of 18 months 128
patients either admitted to the hospital or treated as outpatients. all patients with cirrhosis who complained of sleep
difficulties lasting for a period of more than 3 months were
considered for inclusion in the study. inclusion criteria were
as follows: biopsy-proven cirrhosis, age 18–70 yr, a score
>10 on the epworth sleepiness scale, a simple and reliable method to quantify excessive daytime somnolence (13).
exclusion criteria were the following: significant depressive
disorders (a well-known factor for insomnia (14)), psychiatric or neurological disease other than he, current use of
psychotropic drugs including benzodiazepines, active alcoholism, as well as medical conditions that contraindicated
the use of hydroxyzine. we used the beck depression inventory (15) for detecting significant depressive symptoms. this
widely used instrument consists of a list of items related to
depressive symptoms and/or attitude to be completed by the
patient, and takes less than 10 minutes to perform.

methods
this study was a double-blind, randomized placebocontrolled trial. we did not choose a cross-over design but
a randomization into two treatment arms, essentially for two
reasons. first, the pharmacokinetics of hydroxyzine in cirrhotics with liver failure are not clearly defined, which in turn
would have generated considerable uncertainty regarding the
optimal washout period between the two treatment phases.
second, in our experience, we felt that trying to keep such
patients with liver failure and minimal he under a clinical
trial for a long period of time (i.e., more than 3 wk) would be
associated with a high rate of dropout and clinical events.
because of the lack of prior studies on the effect of antihistamines in sleep difficulties in patients with cirrhosis, the
sample size was calculated as follows: on the one hand,  xxxd3050xxx , an h1-receptor antagonist, partly restored circadian
rhythmicity by 40–50% in portocaval shunted rats (12). on
the other hand, lactulose is associated with a marginal (about
10%) improvement in sleep disturbances measured in cirrhotic patients with he and severe liver failure (16). thus, to
achieve a statistical power of 85% at 5% type i error, with the
initial assumption that sleep behavior will improve by 40%
in the hydroxyzine group and 10% in the placebo group, a
sample size of 17 patients in each arm was calculated.
a randomization code with an equal number of the alternative treatments was generated using a manual randomization
list by our central pharmacy, in blocks of four. the code was

not broken until the end of the study. randomization was
done with sequentially numbered, sealed envelopes using the
previously determined code to either hydroxyzine or placebo.
patients in the treatment arm received hydroxyzine 25 mg
daily for 10 days, to be taken between 9 and 11 pm, and the
patients on placebo were administered a capsule filled with
flour pellets, identical in appearance to the active drug, and
prepared by our central pharmacy. the patients were given
either the active drug or the placebo in a transparent plastic
box containing pills for the 10-day trial. hydroxyzine is a
first-generation h1-receptor antagonist with sedative properties as a result of lipid solubility that allows penetration into
the central nervous system. we postulated that a small dose
of 25 mg daily would be well tolerated and associated with
a clinical effect. in fact, administration of a higher dose of
antihistamine (0.7 mg/kg single dose of cetirizine, another
h1-receptor antagonist) induced blurred vision, dizziness,
and dry mouth in two patients with primary biliary cirrhosis
(17).
prior to drug administration and at the end of the study
period, several tests were performed, including a subjective
assessment of sleep behavior, a 4-day and 4-night period of
wrist actigraphy recording, measurement of protein  xxxg2007xxx 
serum levels, and a battery of neuropsychological tests (see
fig. 1). because of the lipophilic properties of hydroxyzine,
we felt a thorough evaluation of cognitive impairment before
and while on hydroxyzine would be of particular concern to
evaluate the risk of precipitating he.
compliance to study drug/placebo was assessed by pill
counting at day 10. an additional visit was scheduled at day 5
to assess the patient’s clinical status, record a possible adverse
event, and inquire about any protocol violation regarding the
use of sedatives. the primary end point was the effect on sleep
behavior (both subjectively and using wrist actigraphy), and
the secondary end points included the safety of hydroxyzine
and evolution of psychometric tests and serum  xxxg2007xxx  protein
level.
actigraphy

laboratory. in the absence of itching, it is a valuable alternative to polysomnography for the assessment of sleep disturbances (1, 19). the actigraph (actiwatch activity monitoring
system, cambridge neurotechnology ltd., cambridgeshire,
uk) is a compact, lightweight, wrist-worn electronic device
that measures and records physical movement. thus, it is an
activity monitor, where activity is measured by the means of
a piezoelectric accelerometer that is set up to record the integration of intensity, amount, and duration of movement in all
directions. as a result of the way of recording, no sensitivity
setting is needed and the actiwatch records all movements
over 0.05 g. the corresponding voltage produced is converted
and stored as an activity count in the memory unit of the actiwatch. the activity count, recorded two times per minute
over the period of 4 days and 4 nights, was analyzed using
information from patient’s log of sleep–wake times.
the device was worn all the time on the nondominant arm
during the recording period of 4 days and 4 nights, except
when exposed to water. patients kept a sleep diary in which
bedtime, wakeup time, and total time spent in bed for sleeping purposes were recorded. activity measured via the wrist
monitor (expressed as artificial units) during the time period
of the night devoted to sleep (between bedtime and wakeup
time) was determined as the nighttime activity (nta). thus,
a low-activity recording on the actiwatch during the time
period devoted to sleep corresponded to a low rate of awakenings throughout the night, indicating a satisfactory sleep.
on the other hand, a high nta level (during the periods of
time used for sleeping purposes according to patient’s sleep
diary) was an indicator of frequent awakenings as part of a
disturbed sleep.
the activity recorded outside this period was determined
as daytime activity (dta). we defined sleep efficiency (se, in
%) as the value of total time spent in bed for sleeping purposes
divided by the nta, multiplied by 100. typically, for patients
with difficulties getting asleep, fragmented nocturnal sleep
with frequent awakenings exhibits low se values. the mean
value of nta, dta, and se measured in each patient over
the 4-days and 4-night period was kept for analysis.
wrist actigraphy measurements in 12 healthy subjects
without sleep difficulties and not under any psychotropic or
hypnotic medications served as control values.
subjective assessment of sleep
subjective measure of sleep was derived from a visual analog
scale (vas) rating. patients indicated, by placing a mark on
the 20-cm line, how satisfied they were with their sleep during
the 4-day period. the line had a scale with values ranging
from 0 (very bad sleep) to 10 (excellent sleep).
neuropsychological tests
we designed a neuropsychological test battery that included
standardized and validated tests (20) set up to evaluate specific cognitive fields that are frequently impaired in cirrhosis.
thus, to assess functioning across a number of neuropsychological domains (executive functioning, learning and mem-

ory, and attention), we used the following tests. except for the
digit span and corsi block that have been previously standardized, we obtained normative data for each test used in
the neuropsychological assessment. these data were issued
from a control population of healthy subjects in the age range
20–75 yr examined in our hospital.
executive
function. we
evaluated
initiation/strategic abilities using verbal and nonverbal fluency
tests. the patient had to generate in 2 minutes as many words
as possible belonging to one given category, or starting
with a given letter. for assessing inhibition capacities, we
used part a and b of the trail-making test, which measures
psychomotor speed and mental flexibility. the patient was
required to connect, as rapidly as possible, circles numbered
consecutively from 1 to 25, and then alternatively numbers
and letters from 1 to 13 and a to l.
learning and memory. this neuropsychological domain was assessed using the grober and buschke learning
test, during which the patient had to identify 16 pictures, recall them immediately and after a brief interval of time. the
total number of items recalled by the subjects during three
consecutive trials was scored and transformed into an educational and age-graded normative value.
working memory was appraised by the digit span (verbal span) and the corsi block test (visual–spatial span). the
series containing the maximum number of items recalled by
the subject was scored and transformed into an age-graded
normative value.
attention. disruption of attention and mental agility
were assessed using two different and complementary tests. in
the digit symbol subtest issued from the wechsler adult intelligence scale-revised (wais-r), the patient was required
to transpose digits (1 to 10) in graphic symbolic patterns as
fast as possible. to evaluate sustained attention, the subject
had to identify target stimuli among distracters in a minimum
of time and with a minimum of errors (d2 test).
the results of the patient’s performance on each neuropsychological test were transformed into z scores. briefly, we
calculated z scores as the difference between the expected
performance obtained in a control group (matched for age,
gender, and level of education) and the performance measured in each patient, divided by the standard errors in the
control population. the mean of each z score was kept as the
global performance on the neuropsychological examination.
a global z score 1.5 sd below the mean was considered abnormal and suggested mild deficit that was characteristic of
minimal he (21).
the time that was necessary to complete the tests was approximately 45 minutes. all patients were investigated in a
quiet environment, in the late morning or in the midafternoon, by two investigators expert in neurological troubles of
cirrhosis (a.c. and j-m.a).

such as ammonia (22). accordingly, extracellular circulating  xxxg2007xxx  concentrations are increased in minimal he (23),
and thus could be of value in monitoring the severity of he.
serum levels were measured using a specific commercially
available radioimmunoassay (sangtec 100 elisa, diasorin,
stillwater, mn). blood was drawn in a fasting state at baseline and at the end of the study period, and transported immediately on ice to the laboratory. after centrifugation for 15
minutes at 5◦ c, aliquots were made under pyrogen-free conditions and the samples kept frozen at –70◦ c until assayed.
measurements were made in duplicate. the detection limit is
0.03 µg/l and the normal value is 0.15 µg/l. the intra- and
interassay variation was 3.8% and 4.7%, respectively.

ethical considerations
the study protocol was approved by our institution’s ethics
committee and was in accordance with the declaration of
helsinki. all patients gave a written informed consent to participate.

statistics
data are expressed as median and range unless otherwise
noted. statistical comparisons were performed with the
intention-to-treat principles. we used the kruskal-wallis,
wilcoxon-signed rank, and 2-sided fisher exact tests as
appropriate. correlation analysis was performed using the
nonparametric spearman rank test. the limit for statistical significance was set at p < 0.05. all calculations were
made using the stat view 5.0 program (sas institute inc.,
berkeley, ca).

results
the study is reported according to the consort guidelines (24). the algorithm of patient selection is depicted in
figure 2. the period of recruitment was 18 months (august 2003 to february 2005). sixty-five patients were considered for inclusion in the study. thirty patients could not
be included for the following reasons: age >75 (n = 2),
cerebrovascular disease (n = 2), depression (n = 7), regular use of benzodiazepines (n = 8), refused to participate
(n = 2), active alcoholism (n = 5), and chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease contraindicating the use of hydroxyzine
(n = 4). seventeen patients were randomly assigned to hydroxyzine and 18 to placebo (table 1). the majority of the
patients had alcoholic cirrhosis in a stable condition. sixtyeight percent were outpatients, and the remaining 11 patients
were studied while hospitalized for a preliver transplantation
workup, or for rehabilitation several weeks following decompensation. each patient had a normal mental status on physical examination, which corresponds to stage 0 of he according to an adapted classification issued from an international
working party (25, 26). no patient was on shift work. four

chronic treatment for he included regular use of nonabsorbable disaccharides and/or

previous episode of he refers to type c episodic he according to definitions issued
from an international working party (26).
tips = transjugular intrahepatic shunt; he = hepatic encephalopathy.

patients in the hydroxyzine group and three in the placebo
group had a portal-systemic shunt placed by tips (n = 6)
or surgically constructed (n = 1). all patients had clinically
significant portal hypertension (27) with a hepatic venous
pressure gradient above 10 mmhg (measured in 29 patients)
and/or presence of esophageal varices or ascites. eleven patients in the hydroxyzine group and 12 in the placebo group
were treated with lactulose and/or nonabsorbable antibiotics
for minimal he. the dose of lactulose was adjusted to obtain
two soft stools per day.
compliance with study drug and placebo exceeded 80% as
assessed by pill counting in both groups. no patient reported
any side effects related to the anticholinergic properties of
hydroxyzine (dry mouth, urinary retention, blurred vision).
however, one patient developed an acute episode of he on
the eighth day of treatment with hydroxyzine (for details, see
below, “neuropsychological tests”) and thus did not receive
the full treatment. two patients (one in each group) were
excluded by the investigators during the trial for protocol
violation because of absorption of a psychoactive drug. so,
these two patients did not receive the totality of the allocated
treatment.

the end of the study period, sleep improved subjectively in
the hydroxyzine but not in the placebo group (+40% versus

shunt (7.7 vs 16, p < 0.02).
after a 10-day treatment period, there was a statistically
significant decrease in nta in hydroxyzine-treated patients
but not in placebo-treated patients (–36% vs +16%, p <
0.015). consequently, sleep efficiency increased in the hydroxyzine group but not in the placebo group (+70% vs –
2.5%, p < 0.007, fig. 4). as illustrated in figure 5, improvement in se was detected early after initiation of treatment.
twenty-five percent of the patients receiving placebo versus
65% of the patients under hydroxyzine had a ≥30% increase
in se (p < 0.04). figure 6 illustrates a typical wrist actigraphy recording (4 days and 4 nights) of a 58-yr-old woman

hydroxyzine.
changes in dta over the 10-day study period were nonsignificant (hydroxyzine group [+10%] vs placebo group
[+21%], p = 0.23).
neuropsychological tests
all patients had a complete neuropsychological evaluation
performed at baseline, while two patients (one in each group)
were excluded during the trial in relation to a psychoactive
drug absorbed in violation to the protocol.
at the time of baseline evaluation, 14 out of 17 patients
from the hydroxyzine group and 17 out of 18 patients from
the placebo group met the criteria of minimal he according to recently published recommendations (21). however,
as the majority of the patients were on long-term treatment
with nonabsorbable disaccharides/antibiotics, we considered

discussion
in this randomized controlled trial on carefully selected patients with cirrhosis and long-standing sleep difficulties, subjective improvement in sleep quality was observed in 40% of
the patients receiving hydroxyzine but in none receiving the
placebo preparation, while objective improvement in sleep
behavior was observed in 65% of the patients taking hydroxyzine compared with 25% of those under placebo. our inclusion and exclusion criteria resulted in the enrollment of a
relatively homogeneous patient population.
the problem of sleep difficulties is highly prevalent in cirrhotics, being as high as 50% as compared with 15% in a
general population (1). it is generally accepted that this symptom is part of the spectrum of clinical manifestations of he
(5, 22). however, before assuming that sleep alterations may
be related to he, one has to exclude the presence of depression (14), active alcohol consumption (29), and itching, all of
which may cause insomnia. provided that such factors have
been reasonably excluded in our patients, we feel that sleep
abnormalities were related to he.
to measure sleep behavior, we used wrist actigraphy, which
is a convenient method to study sleep–wake cycles in a home
environment. in the absence of itching, this method correlates
to electroencephalogram (eeg) under laboratory conditions
(30), is less labor intensive, and cheaper than polysomnography (31). the frequent awakenings and reduction in sleep
efficiency observed in our patients are consistent with findings of a previous study (1). these alterations were even more
pronounced in the subgroup of patients with tips or a surgical shunt, as previously reported (2).
there was no relationship between sleep, as measured using wrist actigraphy parameters, and cognitive performance
either at baseline or in relation to treatment. of interest,
 xxxg2007xxx  protein showed elevated serum values at baseline,
as reported (23), but remained unaffected in relation to hydroxyzine. thus, these two problems, which are often observed in minimal he, may, in fact, result from different
mechanisms. the mechanisms involved in sleep alterations
in patients with cirrhosis are still unclear. it has been documented that the rhythm of plasma melatonin production,
a pineal gland hormone that modulates the circadian pacemaker (3), is abnormal in patients with cirrhosis (6). however, this phenomenon could not be related to sleep disturbances as assessed by sleep diaries. another hypothesis
ensues from dysregulated central histaminergic neurotransmission observed in portocaval-shunted animals, showing a

751

disturbed biogenic amines system with an increased brain
tissue level of histamine (32), tele-methylhistamine (an indirect marker of histaminergic activity (33), and its receptor
h1 (10). such an alteration in the density of brain histamine
h1 receptors has also been documented in patients who died
in hepatic coma (10). as histaminergic neurotransmission
is physiologically involved in the regulation of a number of
systems, including sleep–wake cycle and vigilance, it may be
expected that disturbances in central histaminergic h1 neurotransmission could result in sleep behavior alterations in
cirrhosis.
our results showing an improved sleep efficiency in the
majority of patients with cirrhosis administered a  xxxg1078xxx  blocker is clinically relevant considering the negative effect of sleep difficulties on quality of life (4) and the lack
of pharmacological agents that can be prescribed in this situation (5). however, we realize that the present study has
several limitations. first, the improved sleep in patients with
cirrhosis is not proof that central histamine neurotransmission is restored, as first-generation antihistamines are known
to induce somnolence (34) because of the passage through
the blood–brain barrier, independent of the presence of a
liver disease. in addition, histamine receptor tissue analysis
was not performed for obvious reasons. second, this study
was not designed to compare hydroxyzine with other sedatives such as benzodiazepines, and thus the risk of precipitating he cannot be compared. third, we did not explore
the possibility that a smaller dose of hydroxyzine could be
beneficial with less risk of inducing he. finally, we did not
consider the role of other potentially disrupted neurotransmitter systems (35) that may interfere with sleep regulation in
cirrhosis.
in conclusion, in patients with cirrhosis and minimal
he, administration of hydroxyzine 25 mg at bedtime improves sleep behavior independently of an effect on cognitive performance. the risk of precipitating he warrants some
caution.
until more data are available on the subject, in everyday
clinical practice, we do apply the following rules in patients
with cirrhosis and sleep difficulties attributable to minimal
he. first, we ensure that the patient is not under a psychoactive drug such as benzodiazepine. second, in the absence of previous episodes of he, we administer hydroxyzine
25 mg at bedtime for two consecutive nights. if sleep is subjectively improved, provided that signs of overt he are absent,
the treatment is continued either on a regular basis or on demand, sometimes preserving a therapeutic effect using only
half a tablet. on the other hand, if no benefit is reported after
two consecutive days (fig. 5), we feel it is useless (and potentially dangerous) to continue hydroxyzine. finally, if the
patient is at high risk of he (age >65, tips or surgical shunt,
previous episodes of he), hydroxyzine 12.5 mg is administered and apparition of flapping tremor or other symptoms of
he is closely monitored. if such a sign appears, hydroxyzine
is definitely stopped.
