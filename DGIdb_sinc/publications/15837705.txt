abstract
changes in trigonelline content and in biosynthetic
activity were determined in the cotyledons and embryonic axes of etiolated mungbean (phaseolus aureus)
seedlings during germination. accumulation of trigonelline (c. 240 nmol per pair of cotyledons) was
observed in the cotyledons of dry seeds; trigonelline
content decreased 2 d after imbibition. trigonelline
content in the embryonic axes increased with seedling
growth and reached a peak (c. 380 nmol per embryonic
axis) at day 5. trigonelline content did not change
signiﬁcantly during the differentiation of hypocotyls,
and the concentration was greatest in the apical 5 mm.
 xxxd2715xxx  and nicotinamide were better precursors
for pyridine nucleotide synthesis than quinolinic acid,
but no great differences were found in the synthesis of
trigonelline from these three precursors. trigonelline
synthesis was always higher in embryonic axes than in
cotyledons. activity of  xxxg1913xxx  ( xxxg1913xxx ),  xxxg1502xxx  ( xxxg1502xxx ), and nicotinamidase (ec
3.5.1.19) was found in cotyledons and embryonic
axes, but no nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase
(ec 2.4.2.12) activity was detected. it follows that
quinolinic acid and  xxxd2715xxx  were directly converted to  xxxd2715xxx  mononucleotide by the respective phosphoribosyltransferases, but nicotinamide
appeared to be converted to  xxxd2715xxx  mononucleotide after conversion to  xxxd2715xxx . trigonelline
synthase (nicotinate n-methyltransferase, ec 2.1.1.7)
activity increased in the embryonic axes, but decreased

in cotyledons during germination. [14c] xxxd2715xxx 
and trigonelline absorbed by the cotyledons were
transported to the embryonic axes during germination. trigonelline had no effect on the growth of
seedlings, but  xxxd2715xxx  and nicotinamide significantly inhibited the growth of roots. based on these
ﬁndings, the role of trigonelline synthesis in mungbean seedlings is discussed.
key words: detoxiﬁcation, mungbean, nad metabolism, nicotinamide,  xxxd2715xxx , phaseolus aureus, pyridine nucleotide

introduction
metabolism of pyrimidine and purine nucleotides has been
investigated by the present authors in leguminous seeds
during germination (ashihara, 1977, 1983; nobusawa and
ashihara, 1983). pyridine (nicotinamide adenine) nucleotides are also important nucleotides for life, because they
are coenzymes for redox reactions. many legumes produce
trigonelline as a secondary metabolite derived from nad.
several physiological functions of trigonelline have been
proposed (minorsky, 2002), but little is known about the
biosynthesis and metabolism of this compound in plants.
using pea seedlings, evans and co-workers suggested that
trigonelline is a plant hormone present in cotyledons, and
that it promotes cell arrest in g2 during cell maturation in
roots and shoots (evans et al., 1979; tramontano et al.,
1982; evans and tramontano, 1984).

the research programme aims to examine the nucleotide
metabolism of germinating plant seeds (ashihara, 1977,
1983; nobusawa and ashihara, 1983; stasolla et al., 2001,
2003). as part of this programme, the de novo and salvage
pathways of pyridine nucleotide metabolism and the
accumulation and transport of trigonelline are reported
here. the effect of exogenously supplied pyridine compounds on seedling growth was tested. from these results,
the detailed metabolism of pyridine nucleotides and a possible role of trigonelline in leguminous plants are proposed.

radiochemicals
[3h]quinolinic acid (specific activity 200 gbq mmol1), [carbonyl14
c]nicotinamide (specific activity 1.96 gbq mmol1), and
[carboxyl-14c] xxxd2715xxx  (specific activity 1.92 gbq mmol1)
were obtained from moravek biochemicals, inc, brea, ca, usa.
[carboxyl-14c]trigonelline was prepared using a commercially available [carboxyl-14c]  xxxd2715xxx  and mungbean cotyledons. in
summary, slices of mungbean cotyledons (c. 2 g) were incubated with
phosphate buffer and 9 mbq [carboxyl- 14c] xxxd2715xxx  for 18 h.
after extraction, the trigonelline was purified with a dowex 1-x4
column (cl form) and hplc according to the methods detailed in
a previous paper (zheng and ashihara, 2004), and its specific activity
was 2.4 mbq mmol1.
plant materials
seeds of mungbean (phaseolus aureus roxb=vigna radiate l.) were
obtained from the carolina biological supply company, burlington,
nc, usa. eighty seeds were sterilized with a saturated solution of
sodium hypochlorite and were placed on 100 ml of 0.55% agar in
a 500 ml erlenmeyer flask. the flasks were kept in the dark at 26 8c.
cotyledons and embryonic (shoot–root) axes were separated and
used as experimental materials. to examine the effect of nicotinic
acid, nicotinamide, and trigonelline on seedling growth, 1 mm
solutions of these three compounds were sterilized using a disposable
syringe filter unit (advantec toyo, tokyo, japan) and were added to
the agar medium.
determination of endogenous levels of trigonelline
trigonelline was extracted with 80% methanol and analysed with
hplc, as in a previous paper (zheng and ashihara, 2004) except that
the absorbance was monitored using a shimadzu diode array
detector, type spd-m10a.
administration and analysis of labelled precursors
the labelled compounds were administered as described in a previous
paper (ashihara et al., 2000). samples (c. 100 mg fresh weight) and
2.0 ml of 20 mm sodium phosphate buffer (ph 5.6) containing
10 mm sucrose were placed in the main compartment of a 30 ml
erlenmeyer flask fitted with a small glass tube containing a piece of
filter paper impregnated with 0.1 ml of 20% koh in the centre well,
to collect 14co2. for [3h]quinolinic acid, flasks without the centre
well were used. each reaction was started by adding a solution of
radioactive compound to the main compartment of the flask. the
flasks were incubated in an oscillating water bath at 27 8c. after
incubation the plant materials were harvested, washed with distilled
water, kept in an extraction medium (80% methanol containing
20 mm sodium  xxxd1917xxx ) and stored at 30 8c prior to
extraction.

transport and metabolism of radiolabelled  xxxd2715xxx  and
trigonelline
sets of ten sterilized mungbean seeds were incubated with 1.2 ml
(37 kbq) of solution of [carboxyl-14c] xxxd2715xxx  or [carboxyl14
c]trigonelline. absorption of radioactive compounds was completed after 6 h. after that, some of the seeds were germinated on
0.55% agar and others were immediately analysed. the cotyledons
and embryonic axes of the 1-, 2-, 3-, and 4-d-old seedlings were
collected and analysed.
determination of enzyme activity
the activity of all enzymes in this study was determined using
labelled substrates. the total volume of reaction mixtures was 100 ll,
and incubation took place at 30 8c. the enzyme reactions were
terminated by transferring the test tubes to a boiling water bath. after
brief centrifuging, the precipitate was removed and an aliquot of each
sample was loaded onto the cellulose tlc plate. labelled substrate
and product were separated by tlc using the same solvent as
described above. all reaction mixtures for enzyme assay contained
50 mm hepes-naoh buffer (ph 7.6) together with the following
components. (i)  xxxg1913xxx : 0.05 mm
[3h]quinolinic acid (specific activity, 3.6 gbq mmol1), 0.75 mm
 xxxd2937xxx , 10 mm mgcl2, and 1 mm dtt. (ii) nicotinate phosphoribosyltransferases and nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferases:
the components were the same as  xxxg1913xxx , but 0.05 mm quinolinic acid was replaced by [carboxyl-14c] xxxd2715xxx  (specific activity, 310 mbq mmol1) or
[carbonyl-14c]nicotinamide (specific activity, 310 mbq mmol1),
and 1 mm atp was added. (iii) nicotinamidase: 0.1 mm [carbonyl14
c]nicotinamide (specific activity, 170 mbq mmol1). (iv) trigonelline synthase: 0.1 mm [carboxyl-14c] xxxd2715xxx  (specific
activity, 170 mbq mmol1), 1 mm s-adenosyl- xxxd2595xxx .

changes in endogenous trigonelline content during
germination

figure 1a shows the fresh weight of a pair of cotyledons
and an embryonic axis in various stages of germination of
mungbean seedlings. the fresh weight of cotyledons increased for 1 d after imbibition and then decreased. the
weight in the embryonic axis increased rapidly after 2 d.
similar growth has been reported of beans (ashihara, 1977;
ashihara and matsumura, 1977).
the changes in trigonelline content in organs and its
concentration in cotyledons and embryonic axes during
germination were determined (fig. 1b, c). the seeds

materials and methods

labelled metabolites were extracted and analysed as described
previously (zheng and ashihara, 2004). plant materials were homogenized in a pestle and mortar with the extraction medium
specified above, and the resulting methanol-soluble fraction was
separated by tlc using microcrystalline cellulose tlc plates
(merck, darmstadt, germany). solvent systems i and iv of the
previous paper (zheng and ashihara, 2004) were used to identify
radiolabelled metabolites. radioactivity on the tlc sheet was
determined using a bio-imaging analyser (type, fla-2000, fuji
photo film co., ltd. tokyo, japan). spots of 3h on the tlc were
scraped off and eluted from the cellulose support with water, and
radioactivity was determined using a liquid scintillation counter
(beckman, type ls 6500).

accumulated a high amount of trigonelline (c. 250 nmol
seed1), and 96% of total trigonelline was distributed in the
cotyledons. the trigonelline content in cotyledons fell
rapidly after 3 d of germination. the concentration of
trigonelline g1 fresh weight was high in seeds, but
decreased after 1 d, consistent with the water uptake. the
trigonelline content in embryonic axes increased gradually
and reached a peak (c. 380 nmol axis1) at day 5. its concentration fell rapidly during the first few days.

hypocotyls of germinating mungbean seeds contain differing stages of cells (ashihara and sato, 1993). the hypocotyls (55 mm) of 4-d-old etiolated mungbean seedlings
were separated into parts: part 1 (the apical 5 mm of the
hypocotyls including hook), 2 (5–15 mm), 3 (15–25 mm),
4 (25–35 mm), 5 (35–45 mm), and 6 (45–55 mm). the cells
in part i consisted of young cells, whereas elongation cells
were distributed in parts 2 to 4, and parts 5 and 6 contained
a large number of ageing cells (ashihara et al., 1974).
trigonelline was distributed in all parts of the hypocotyl,
although a high concentration was found in part i (fig. 2).
metabolism of [ 3h]quinolinic acid, [14c] xxxd2715xxx ,
and [14c]nicotinamide

in coffee, [3h]quinolinic acid, [14c] xxxd2715xxx , and
[14c]nicotinamide were used as precursors for trigonelline
synthesis (zheng et al., 2004). to investigate which
compound is the best precursor for trigonelline synthesis
in mungbean, the metabolism of these compounds was

effect of concentration of  xxxd2715xxx  on
its metabolism
to investigate whether the concentration of  xxxd2715xxx 
alters the metabolic fate of [carboxyl-14c] xxxd2715xxx ,
differing concentrations of  xxxd2715xxx  were administered to the embryonic axes of 2-d-old seedlings, and the
distribution of radioactivity was examined (table 1). when
the segments of axes were incubated with 6–1000 lm

seedlings. the duration of incubation was 18 h. the rates of incorporation
of radioactivity into various metabolites are expressed as a percentage of

qa, quinolinic acid; tg, trigonelline.

[carboxyl-14c] xxxd2715xxx , the total uptake of nicotinic
acid varied from 1.5 to 334 nmol (100 mg)1 fresh
weight. at a lower concentration range (6–15 lm), the
rate of conversion from  xxxd2715xxx  to pyridine nucleotides was higher at 6 lm (c. 17% of total radioactivity)
than at 15 lm (c. 5%), but that to trigonelline was similar
for these two concentrations (78% and 74%, respectively).
these results suggest that  xxxd2715xxx  is used preferentially for pyridine nucleotides synthesis, and the rest is
for trigonelline synthesis. trigonelline synthesis increased
up to 30 nmol (100 mg)1 fresh weight when the
exogenous  xxxd2715xxx  concentration was increased to
1 mm. however, nearly 90% of the  xxxd2715xxx  taken
up by the segments remained (table 1).
changes in  xxxd2715xxx  metabolism in cotyledons
and embryonic axes during germination
in cotyledons, more than one half of [carboxyl-14c] xxxd2715xxx  taken up by the segments was converted to
pyridine nucleotides and less than a quarter of the total
activity to trigonelline (fig. 4).  xxxd2715xxx  salvage
activity for pyridine nucleotide synthesis was therefore
higher than the biosynthetic activity of trigonelline. no
significant metabolic changes were observed during germination. interestingly, trigonelline synthesis still occurred
even in the later stage of germination in which trigonelline
content was markedly reduced. in the embryonic axes,
there was much more trigonelline synthetic activity than
pyridine nucleotide synthesis during the entire period of
germination. trigonelline synthesis fell gradually after 3 d
of germination. this suggests that trigonelline synthesis is
greater in young cells than in older ones.
translocation of trigonelline and related compounds in
germinating seeds
to examine the translocation of trigonelline that accumulated in cotyledons, [carboxyl-14c] xxxd2715xxx  was administered for 6 h. almost all the radioactivity was
recovered from the cotyledons of the seeds; about 60%
was distributed in trigonelline and 30% in pyridine nucleotides (fig. 5a). these radioactive seeds were planted in
agar medium, and germinated in the dark. after 1, 2, 3, and
4 d, the seedlings were collected and separated into
cotyledons and embryonic axes. more than 80% of the
radioactivity observed in the cotyledons of the seeds had
moved to the embryonic axes with 4 d (fig. 5a). the
radioactivity of trigonelline in the cotyledons of imbibed
seeds was c. 2.3 kbq, but that in embryonic axes at day 4
was 2.6 kbq (fig. 6b). the radioactivity of trigonelline in
cotyledons decreased gradually and reached a minimum of
0.4 kbq on day 4 (fig. 6a).
in addition to trigonelline in imbibed seeds, some nad
and nadp in the seeds may therefore be converted to
trigonelline and/or other degradation products and transported to the embryonic axes.

compared using cotyledons and embryonic axes of 1-d-old
seedlings (fig. 3). in cotyledons, 50–60% of the radioactivity was recovered in trigonelline and 20% of the
radioactivity from [3h]quinolinic acid; nearly 40% of that
from [carbonyl-14c]nicotinamide and [carboxyl-14c] xxxd2715xxx  was distributed in pyridine nucleotides. in
embryonic axes, more than 70% of the radioactivity of
the three precursors was incorporated into trigonelline, and
10% of the radioactivity from [3h]quinolinic acid and more
than 20% of that from [carbonyl-14c]nicotinamide and
[carboxyl-14c] xxxd2715xxx  was distributed in the nucleotides. these results suggest that  xxxd2715xxx  mononucleotide is produced by both de novo and salvage pathways,
and is then used for nad and trigonelline synthesis in
mungbean seedlings.

effect of trigonelline and related compounds on
the growth of seedlings

the effect of exogenously supplied 1 mm trigonelline,
nicotinamide, and  xxxd2715xxx  on the fresh weight of
mungbean seedlings and on the length of shoots and roots
was studied (fig. 7a-c). nicotinamide and  xxxd2715xxx 
slightly inhibited the rise in fresh weight during germination, but trigonelline had no such effect. remarkably,
 xxxd2715xxx  and nicotinamide severely inhibited root
growth (fig. 7c). no significant effect of these compounds
on the growth of shoots was observed, but trigonelline
promoted shoot growth.

activity, 1.92 gbq mmol1) in cotyledons (a) and embryonic axes (b) of

4 h. the rates of incorporation of radioactivity into various metabolites
are expressed as a percentage of the total radioactivity taken up by the
segments. the mean values and sd (n=3) are shown. the nucleotides are
nad, nadp, and very small amounts of  xxxd2715xxx  mononucleotide
and  xxxd323xxx . abbreviations, see legend for fig. 3.

changes in activity of trigonelline metabolism enzymes
significant activities of  xxxg1913xxx ,  xxxg1502xxx , and nicotinamidase were found in cotyledons and embryonic axes, but
no nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase activity was
detected (table 2). atp is required for the activity of
 xxxg1502xxx , but not for  xxxg1913xxx . therefore, quinolinic acid
and  xxxd2715xxx  were salvaged by the respective phosphoribosyltransferases directly, but nicotinamide appeared
to be converted to  xxxd2715xxx  mononucleotide after
conversion to  xxxd2715xxx  by  xxxg1502xxx . in fact, a small amount of 14c- xxxd2715xxx 
mononucleotide was detected when the nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase was assayed with 14c-nicotinamide
(data not shown).

to confirm the translocation of trigonelline, 14c-trigonelline
was prepared using the mungbean seedlings shown in the
materials and methods, and the same experiments were
performed using [carboxyl-14c]trigonelline (fig. 5b). trigonelline in cotyledons moved gradually to the embryonic
axes, and c. 80% of the radioactivity of trigonelline was
found in the axes on day 4. no conversion of trigonelline to
other compounds was detected.
these results suggest that trigonelline stored in cotyledons is transported to the embryonic axes during germination. however, transported trigonelline is not easily
metabolized, at least during germination in the dark.

[14c]trigonelline (b) is expressed as a percentage of the total radioactivity
taken up by the segments.

there was trigonelline synthase activity in dry seeds.
this activity increased in the embryonic axes, but decreased
in cotyledons during germination (fig. 8). a similar pattern
was found for  xxxg1913xxx  and
 xxxg1502xxx  (data not shown). by
contrast, nicotinamidase activity increased in both cotyledons and embryonic axes during germination (fig. 8).

discussion
accumulation of trigonelline is found in some leguminosae seeds, such as clover, alfalfa, and mungbean (x zheng,
yamanaka, h ashihara, unpublished observations). the
present study suggests that trigonelline is formed from
 xxxd2715xxx  derived from nad.
in mungbean seedlings, nad is synthesized by both the
de novo and the salvage pathways, as in many other
organisms (magni et al., 1999; sestini et al., 2000; katoh
and hashimoto, 2004). in animals, nicotinamide is salvaged
by nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (rocchigiani
et al., 1992; revollo et al., 2004), but in mungbean
seedlings it is converted to  xxxd2715xxx  by nicotinamidase,

and a product,  xxxd2715xxx , is salvaged by nicotinate
phosphoribosyltransferase. wagner et al. (1986) also reported that they could not find any nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase activity in tobacco extracts. as found in
coffee leaves and fruits (zheng et al., 2004), the six

operates in both cotyledons and embryonic axes of germinating mungbean seeds. however, an enzyme, which catalyses the conversion of  xxxd323xxx  to
nicotinamide riboside, was found to be active in mungbean
extracts. therefore, the seven-membered pyridine nucleotide cycle (pnc vii) could be operative in mungbean
seedlings (fig. 9).
like other enzymes of glycolysis and pyrimidine biosynthesis (ashihara and kameyama, 1989; ashihara and
matsumura, 1977), the activities of trigonelline synthase
(fig. 8) and enzymes related to pyridine nucleotide synthesis (data not shown) were found in extracts from dry
mungbean seeds; their activities decreased with ageing of
the cotyledons. by contrast, nicotinamidase activity was
significant in cotyledons during germination (fig. 8). a
similar pattern has been reported for proteolytic and
amylolytic enzymes (minamikawa, 1979).
the present results suggest that trigonelline is translocated from cotyledons to embryonic axes, like other

fig. 9. possible metabolic pathways of the biosynthesis of trigonelline
and pyridine nucleotides in mungbean seedlings. in this figure, n and na
mean nicotinamide and  xxxd2715xxx  moieties of pyridine compounds,
respectively. naad,  xxxd2715xxx  adenine dinucleotide; namn,  xxxd2715xxx  mononucleotide;  xxxd323xxx ,  xxxd323xxx ;  xxxg1502xxx ,
 xxxg1502xxx ; qaprt,  xxxg1913xxx .

exogenously supplied  xxxd2715xxx  and nicotinamide
inhibited the growth of mungbean seedlings, but trigonelline has no such effect (fig. 7). therefore, one of the
reasons for trigonelline synthesis in mungbean seedlings
could be the detoxification of excess  xxxd2715xxx  and
nicotinamide released from the nad cycle in the cells.

storage compounds, during germination. since 14c-trigonelline
administered to mungbean cotyledons was moved to
embryonic axes, but was not converted to  xxxd2715xxx 
(fig. 5b), it is unlikely that trigonelline acts as a storage
form of  xxxd2715xxx , at least during germination. although trigonelline demethylating activity has been found
in extracts of some plant seeds (shimizu and mazzafera,
2000; taguchi and shimabayashi, 1983), these preliminary
results suggest little or no activity of trigonelline dimethylase in extracts from mungbean seedlings. shimizu and
mazzafera (2000) reported that trigonelline might act as
a reserve molecule for nad synthesis in coffee seeds, but
only at the very early stages of germination or in specific
tissues such as the embryo.
