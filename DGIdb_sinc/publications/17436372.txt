transgenic  xxxd2200xxx  inhibits the production of tnf-alpha,  xxxg1181xxx , and il-8 as well as cox-2 expression in human mast cells.  the most well-known medicinal plant,  xxxd2200xxx  (p. ginseng), contains various phytosterols and bioactive triterpene saponins (ginsenosides).  xxxg267xxx   xxxg777xxx  is a key regulatory enzyme for triterpene biosynthesis and overexpression of the  xxxg267xxx   xxxg777xxx  confers the hyper-production of triterpene saponins to form transgenic ginseng. in this study, we have investigated whether and how transgenic p. ginseng modulates an inflammatory reaction in a stimulated human mast cell line, hmc-1. it was found that transgenic p. ginseng inhibited the production of  xxxg2296xxx  (tnf)-alpha, interleukin (il)-6, il-8, and the expression of  xxxg1884xxx  in phorbol 12- xxxd2681xxx  13-acetate (pma) plus calcium ionophore a23187 (pmaci)-stimulated hmc-1. additionally, we have shown that transgenic p. ginseng suppressed the intracellular calcium level induced by pmaci. these results provide new insights into the pharmacological actions of transgenic p. ginseng as a potential molecule for use in therapy in mast cell-mediated inflammatory diseases.
