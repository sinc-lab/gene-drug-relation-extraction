abstract
 xxxd2450xxx  is an immunosuppressive agent that inhibits de novo synthesis of pyrimidine nucleotides and the activity of protein  xxxg2198xxx .
this study examined the teratogenicity of  xxxd2450xxx  in mice. pregnant mice were treated orally with  xxxd2450xxx  at a dose of 10, 30 or
70 mg/kg/day from day 6 to 15 of pregnancy. at 70 mg/kg, all embryos were resorbed and no live fetuses were detected. at 30 mg/kg,  xxxd2450xxx 
reduced fetal viability, and increased the incidence of multiple external, skeletal and visceral malformations. characteristic external malformations
were neural tube defects, cleft palate and tail deformities. limb malformations were observed in a small number of fetuses. skeletal examinations
revealed malformations of cervical to sacral vertebrae, ribs and sternebrae. in the viscerae, the main anomalies were membranous ventricular
septum defect and persistent truncus arteriosus. the results of this study indicate that  xxxd2450xxx  administered at 30 mg/kg on days 6 to 15 of
pregnancy can induce craniofacial malformations and deformities of the axial skeleton, heart and great vessels in mice.

1. introduction
 xxxd2450xxx  ( xxxd2450xxx ), an isoxazol derivative, is a novel immunosuppressive agent [1]. it has been demonstrated that inhibition
of t-lymphocyte activation and production of igm and igg contribute to the immunosuppressive potential of  xxxd2450xxx  [2].
 xxxd2450xxx  is a potent inhibitor of protein  xxxg2198xxx  and
of dihydroorotate-dehydrogenase, which is the fourth enzyme in
the de novo pathway of pyrimidine nucleotide synthesis [3–7].
this pathway is needed for t-cell activation and proliferation
through a generalized requirement of ribonucleotide precursors
[8].  xxxd2450xxx  may serve as an immunomodulatory agent
by specifically arresting activated lymphocytes via its action
on dihydroorotate-dehydrogenase. another pharmacological
action is the inhibition of protein  xxxg2198xxx  that is known
to play essential roles in signal transduction by the cytokine
receptors [6,7,9,10]. since the differentiation and proliferation

of t-cells are dependent on signaling from cytokines, inhibition
of intracellular tyrosine phosphorylation by  xxxd2450xxx  may
contribute to inhibiting the activation of t-cells [11].
the teratogenicity of  xxxd2450xxx  has been reported in
rats and rabbits. in rats,  xxxd2450xxx  induced multiple malformations including cranioschisis and exencephaly when
administered during organogenesis (days 7–17 of pregnancy)
[12]. in another study, malformations of the head, rump, vertebral column, ribs and limbs were observed [1]. in rabbits,
 xxxd2450xxx  induced fused and incomplete ossification of the
sternebra when rabbits were treated with  xxxd2450xxx  during
fetal organogenesis [12]. although inhibition of dihydroorotatedehydrogenase and/or protein  xxxg2198xxx  is suspected to
be involved in the teratogenicity of  xxxd2450xxx , the mechanism remains unclear. in mice, there is much information
available with respect to their molecular and cellular biology,
and many reports have been published about the effects of
 xxxd2450xxx  treatment on the immune system, dihydroorotatedehydrogenase and protein  xxxg2198xxx  activities. as a first
step in elucidating the teratological mechanisms of  xxxd2450xxx , the present study was performed to investigate the embryo
toxicity and teratogenicity of  xxxd2450xxx  in mice.

2. materials and methods

2.5. statistics

2.1. animals

fetal data was pooled by litter, which served as the unit of analysis. continuous data include maternal body weights, the number of implantations,
post-implantation loss, number of live fetuses, sex ratio, fetal weight, placental
weight, incidence of external, skeletal and visceral anomalies. these parameters were analyzed by dunnett’s parametric multiple t-test to compare each of
the  xxxd2450xxx -treated groups with the control group. binary data including
incidence of dams with fetuses showing external, skeletal and visceral malformations were analyzed by dunnett type multiple comparison for a response rate
to compare each of the  xxxd2450xxx -treated groups with the control group. all
pairwise statistical tests were conducted as two-sided tests. a difference from
the control group was considered statistically significant at a value of p < 0.05.

cd-1 (icr) mice (charles river japan inc.), 10-week-old males and 9-weekold females, were utilized in this study. use of animals in this study was approved
by the animal care and use committee of shionogi & co., ltd. (approval no.: 03
230). the temperature of the animal room ranged from 23 ± 3 ◦ c, and the relative
humidity from 30 to 70%. animals were allowed ad libitum access to sterilized
tap water and diet (certified rodent diet: crf-1 oriental yeast co., ltd. tokyo,
japan). a 12-h light/dark photocycle (08:00 light on) was maintained. estrous
virgin females were mated with males overnight on a one-to-one basis. the morning of copulation plug observation was designated gestation day 0 (gd 0). on gd
5, the plug-positive females were assigned to four groups, i.e. 14 animals to a control group (vehicle) and 7 animals each to three  xxxd2450xxx -treatment groups
(10, 30 or 70 mg/kg/day) using body weight-stratified sequenced randomization.

2.2. test substance and treatment
 xxxd2450xxx  (purity 99.5%), purchased from sigma (st. louis, mo, usa.)
was suspended in 1.0 w/v% carboxymethylcellulose (cmc; nacalai tesque,
kyoto, japan) solution. dams were treated with  xxxd2450xxx  suspended in cmc
at a dose of 10, 30 or 70 mg/kg/day by gavage from gd 6-15. these dose levels
were selected from the results of dose-range finding study, in which pregnant
mice were administered with  xxxd2450xxx  at doses of 1, 10 and 100 mg/kg/day
from gd6-15. at 1 and 10 mg/kg, no adverse effects were found, whereas at
100 mg/kg, body weight gain of dams decreased significantly and all fetuses
were resorbed in all litters. the control dams received cmc. dosing volume
was 10 ml/kg.

2.3. evaluation of embryotoxicity and teratogenicity
all dams were weighed on gd 0, and gd 5 to 18. on gd 18, all dams were
euthanized with exsanguination from posterior vena cava under the anesthesia
with  xxxd2052xxx  and hysterectomized. the uterine contents were examined for
the number of implantations, resorptions, living and dead fetuses, fetal weight,
placental weight and fetal external abnormalities. every second fetus per litter
was preserved in bouin’s solution for subsequent free-hand sectioning to examine visceral anomalies. the remaining fetuses were removed skin, thoracic and
visceral organs and brown fat, fixed in 70% ethanol for skeletal examination,
following euthanasia under the overdosing of pentobarbital sodium. after fixation, fetuses were macerated with potassium hydroxide, stained with alizarin
red s (sigma) in order to detect skeletal anomalies.

2.4. plasma concentration analysis of a77 1726 and leﬂunomide
plasma concentrations of  xxxd2450xxx  and a77 1726, active metabolite of
 xxxd2450xxx  [2-cyano-3 hydroxy-n-(4-trifluoromethylphenyl)-crotonamide],
were analyzed on first day and last day of administration period from gd6
to gd15. for analysis on gd6, plug-positive dams were dosed  xxxd2450xxx 
at 30 mg/kg on gd6 singly. for analysis after treatment on gd15, dams were
dosed from gd6 to gd15 daily. dams were anesthetized with  xxxd2052xxx 
and laparotomized. approximately 1.0 ml blood per time point per animal was
drawn from the posterior vena cava, using heparinized disposable needle-tipped
syringes 1, 2, 4, 8, 24 and 48 h after dosing on gd6 and 0 (not dosed on gd15),
1, 2, 4, 8, 24 and 48 h after dosing on gd15. blood samples were transferred to
the microtubes and immediately centrifuged (720 × g, 15 min, 4 ◦ c) to obtain
plasma. a77 1726 and  xxxd2450xxx  were extracted from 30 ␮l of mouse plasma
by precipitation with a mixture of acetonitrile/methoanol (1:1, v/v). the samples were analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography (hplc) using
an lc-10a lcsolution (shimadzu, kyoto, japan) with the capcellpak c18
mgii (5 ␮l, 150 mm × 2.1 mm i.d., shiseido, tokyo, japan) column and detection at a wavelength of 281 nm for  xxxd2450xxx  and 300 nm for a77 1726,
switching at 8.5 min into the run. a mixture of acetonitrile/2 w/v% phosphoric acid/heptafluorobutyric acid mixture (550:450:2, v/v/v) was used as mobile
phase. as parameters, cmax (␮g/ml), tmax (hour) and auc0–48 h (␮g h/ml) were
calculated with microsoft excel® .

3. results
3.1. body weights of dams
absolute maternal body weights in the 30 and 70 mg/kg
treatment groups were significantly lower than the control (vehicle) group from the mid- to late stages of pregnancy (fig. 1).
although maternal body weight was similar in all groups during
the early dosing (gd6 to 9), loss of body weight was observed
from gd10 onwards at 70 mg/kg. no significant changes in
maternal body weight were observed at the 10 mg/kg dose level.
3.2. plasma concentration analysis of a77 1726 and
leﬂunomide
data on the plasma concentration of a77 1726 are summarized in fig. 2. since the concentrations of  xxxd2450xxx 
were below the limits of quantitation at any single time point
(<0.1 ␮g/ml), these data were not shown. a77 1726 was detected
in the maternal plasma 24 and 48 h after administration on gd6
(single treatment) and on gd15 (daily exposure, gd6 to gd15).
the mean values of the c24 h and c48 h of a77 1726 were 47.4
and 10.0% of the value of the cmax on gd6, respectively. on
gd15, the mean values of c24 h and c48 h were 29.3 and 7.4% of
the value of cmax , respectively. these data indicated the lower
clearance of a77 1726 from maternal blood. meanwhile, the
mean value of c24 h on gd6 was comparable to the value of

fig. 1. changes in body weights of dams treated with  xxxd2450xxx . ** p < 0.01.

fig. 2. plasma concentration–time profiles of a77 1726 in mice. each point represents the mean, and a vertical bar shows +s.d. plasma concentrations of  xxxd2450xxx 
were below the limit of quantitation (<0.1 ␮g/ml) at any time-point, not shown in figure. plasma concentration of a77 1726 were analyzed after dosing  xxxd2450xxx 
at 30 mg/kg/day (a) on gd6 singly and (b) on gd15 (daily dosing from gd6 to gd15).

c0 h on gd15 after dosing daily from gd6, and the values of
cmax and auc0–48 h on gd15 were approximately 1.4 and 1.1
times of those on gd6, respectively. this data indicated that the
plasma concentration of a77 1726 did not increase by repeated
dosing.
3.3. fetal observations
total litter resorption was observed in all dams in the 70mg/kg group. these embryos appeared resorbed at an early stage
of pregnancy, since only implantation scars were found in the
uterus. furthermore, maternal body weights started to decrease

from  xxxd2948xxx  (the 4th days of dosing), and the decrease continued
until gd18 (end of the experiment). on gd18, the body weight
fell to the level of gd0. meanwhile, no maternal clinical signs
were found. these results suggest that fetal losses can account
for the reduction in maternal weight gain during pregnancy, not
maternal adverse effects. at 30 mg/kg, the number of live fetuses
(42.4% drop compared with control data), fetal weight (male:
34.5% drop, female: 37.6% drop) and placental weight (male:
41.5% drop, female: 48.9% drop) were significantly lower than
the control group (table 1).
 xxxd2450xxx  induced observable external, skeletal and visceral malformations at the 30 mg/kg dose level (tables 2–4).

the incidence of fetuses with external, skeletal and visceral
malformations were 77.2 ± 29.4% (5/5; dams with abnormal
fetuses/dams with live fetuses), 100% (5/5) and 51.1 ± 42.3%
(4/5), respectively. the most characteristic external malformation was exencephaly (26.3 ± 29.5%). some dead fetuses also
showed severe neural tube defects (ntds) including anencephaly, as well as a split face (not shown). these observations
demonstrate the potential for  xxxd2450xxx  to adversely affect
neural tube closure in early mouse embryos. other external
malformations observed here were cleft palate (49.3 ± 49.3%),
open eye (24.9 ± 29.5%), short tail (23.3 ± 32.5%) and kinked
tail (38.9 ± 29.4%). shortened lower trunk and limb reduction
defects were also observed at low incidence. most skeletal malformations involved the axial skeleton, ribs, sternebrae and skull
bones. the main malformations were as follows: cervical to
sacral vertebrae (fused cervical arch, misshapen cervical arch,
fused thoracic arch, fused thoracic centrum, fused lumber centrum, fused sacral arch and fused sacral centrum), fused ribs,

misaligned sternebra and fused supraoccipital bone. in the limb,
malpositioned forepaw phalanx and misshapen metacarpal were
found in two fetuses. in the visceral examination, high frequencies of malformations of the heart, great vessels (34.5 ± 39.5%)
and head (22.6 ± 23.4%) were observed. malformations of the
heart and great vessels included persistent atrioventricular canal,
membranous ventricular septum defect, transposed great vessels
and persistent truncus arteriosus. fetuses having exencephaly
as external anomalies showed multiple anomalies of the head
in visceral examinations, i.e. misshapen cerebellum, cerebrum,
rhinencephalon and absent rhinencephalon.

inhibitor, caused severe embryo/fetal toxicity and teratogenicity
in the mouse. treatment with  xxxd2450xxx  at 70 mg/kg induced
severe embryo toxicity; all embryos were absorbed in all dams.
at 30 mg/kg, embryo viability and intrauterine growth were suppressed, and various fetal malformations increased significantly.
ntds, including exencephaly were induced at relatively high
incidence. other malformations observed with high frequency
were open eye, cleft palate, tail deformities and anomalies of the
axial skeleton, and of the heart and great vessels.
repeated administration of  xxxd2450xxx   xxxd1891xxx  mg/kg/day to
pregnant rats during fetal organogenesis has been reported to
induce malformations, mainly cranioschisis (14/279, abnormal
fetuses/examined fetuses), exencephaly (19/279), ventricular
dilation (35/138), anophthalmia (22/138) and microphthalmia
(16/138) [12]. in contrast with rats, we observed no effects
of  xxxd2450xxx   xxxd1891xxx  mg/kg in mice. severe teratogenicity
and embryotoxicity were induced at 30 mg/kg and higher.
although the underlying reasons for cross-species differences in embryotoxicity and teratogenicity are not clear, such
a difference may partially explain why the dihydroorotate
dehydrogenase-inhibitory effect of a77 1726, the active metabolite of  xxxd2450xxx , is higher in mouse than in rat (ic50, rat:
13 nm, mouse: 69 nm) [13]. in toxicokinetics analysis, tmax ,
cmax and auc0–24 h of non-pregnant female rats (6 weeks old)
treated with  xxxd2450xxx  at the dose of 10 mg/kg were 1.0 h,
22.9 ␮g/ml and 319.5 ␮g h/ml, respectively [12]. each parameter in pregnant mice treated at 30 mg/kg measured in this study
was about 5 times in cmax and about 10 times in auc0–24 h compared with rats treated  xxxd1891xxx  mg/kg. from this result, it is assumed
that exposure in rat maybe lower than mouse. therefore, differences of exposure might be also concerned cross-species
differences in embryotoxicity and teratogenicity.
plasma concentration of a77 1726 on human administered
with  xxxd2450xxx  has been reported [14]. healthy male humans
were administered a single 100 mg (clinical dose) of  xxxd2450xxx . plasma samples were collected up to 36 days (864 h)
after dosing. each parameters of plasma concentration of a77
1726 were calculated as follows; cmax , 7.59 ± 1.42 ␮g/ml;
tmax , 12.67 ± 8.87 h; auc0–864 h , 2090.1 ± 448 ␮g h/ml and
t1/2 , 7.76 ± 0.50 days. the value of cmax on mice administered
 xxxd2450xxx  at 30 mg/kg/day in our study was approximately
14 times that in humans administered a tablet of  xxxd2450xxx 
(100 mg), whereas the values of t1/2 and tmax of a77 1726 in
mice were markedly lower than humans. hence, the values of
auc0–48 h on mice and auc0–864 h on human were comparable.
some immunosuppressive agents causing inhibition of de
novo synthesis of pyrimidine nucleotides have been developed (e.g.  xxxd2450xxx ,  xxxd363xxx  and malononitrilamides),
but there has been no report on teratogenicity in any species,
aside from  xxxd2450xxx . teratogenicity has been reported for
some immunosuppressive drugs that inhibit de novo synthesis
of purine nucleotides.  xxxd2678xxx  (mpa, active metabolite of  xxxd2677xxx ) is a potent inhibitor of inosine
monophosphate dehydrogenase (impdh), and inhibits the de
novo synthesis of guanosine nucleotide [15]. in teratogenicity
studies of mpa, fetal resorptions and malformations (anophthalmia, agnathia and hydrocephaly) were induced in rats, and

diaphragmatic hernia in rabbits [16]. bredinin (as known as
mizoribin) is an imidazole nucleoside isolated from eupenicillium brefeldianium with an immunosuppressive activity, known
to be an enzyme inhibitor in the pathway of inosine mono
phosphate (imp) to guanosine 5 -mono phosphate (gmp) conversion [17]. the teratogenicity of bredinin in rats and mice
has been reported [18,19]. in a teratology study in which pregnant mice were treated with bredinin during the period of fetal
organogenesis, no neural tube defects was detected, but multiple malformations were found, including face, limb and tail
malformations. in an in vitro study, the proliferation of mouse
embryonic cells was inhibited by bredinin and rescued by coaddition of guanosine or gmp to the culture medium. in contrast,
the inhibition was not altered by the addition of inosine or imp
[17]. this report suggests that the teratogenicity of bredinin may
be related to the inhibition of purine nucleotide de novo synthesis. in this study, we did not attempt to elucidate the mechanisms
of teratogenicity for  xxxd2450xxx , although, as with inhibition
of purine de novo synthesis, the pyrimidine de novo synthesis
inhibition and anti-proliferative activity of  xxxd2450xxx  can be
attributed to teratogenicity in mouse fetuses.
the results of the present study demonstrated that the isoxazol
derivative  xxxd2450xxx  has embryo toxicity and teratogenicity
at the minimum maternal toxic dose of 30 mg/kg/day in mice.
characteristic malformation was exencephaly, which can be
attributed to abnormal development of the neural tube. other
malformations caused by  xxxd2450xxx  treatment were cleft
palate and deformities of the axial skeleton and the heart and
great vessels.
