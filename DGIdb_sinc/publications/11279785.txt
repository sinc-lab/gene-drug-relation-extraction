abstract
background
discoid lupus erythematosus is a chronic form of cutaneous (skin) lupus which can cause permanent scarring if treatment is inadequate.
many drugs have been used to treat this disease and some of these are potentially very toxic.
objectives
to assess the effects of drugs for discoid lupus erythematosus.
search strategy
we searched the cochrane clinical trials register (december 1999), medline (january 1966 to december 1999), embase
(january 1980 to january 2000), and the reference lists of relevant reviews. index medicus (1956 to 1966) was handsearched and 7
experts in the field were approached for information about unpublished trials.
selection criteria
randomised trials of drugs to treat people with discoid lupus erythematosus. drugs included in the search were azathioprine, chloroquine, clofazimine, corticosteroids, (oral and topical), dapsone, gold,  xxxg1137xxx -2a, methotrexate, phenytoin, retinoids,  xxxd3255xxx  and thalidomide.
data collection and analysis
two authors independently examined each retrieved study for eligibility.
main results
two trials involving 136 participants were included. in a cross-over study of 12 weeks duration  xxxd2129xxx  0.05% cream (a potent
topical corticosteroid), appeared to be markedly better than hydrocortisone 1% cream (a mild corticosteroid). clearing or excellent
improvement was seen in 27% of people using  xxxd2129xxx  and in 10% of those using hydrocortisone, giving a 17% absolute benefit
in favour of  xxxd2129xxx  (95% ci 4.5 to 29.5% and nnt 6).
in the second trial,  xxxd2301xxx  was compared with  xxxd71xxx  in 58 people. there was marked improvement or clearing in 46%
of people using  xxxd71xxx  and in 50% of those on  xxxd2301xxx , a non significant 4% absolute gain with  xxxd2301xxx 
(95%ci -23% to 30%). the adverse effects were more frequent and more severe in the  xxxd71xxx  group.

authors’ conclusions
 xxxd2129xxx  cream may be more effective than hydrocortisone in treating people with discoid lupus erythematosus.  xxxd2301xxx  and  xxxd71xxx  appear to be of equal efficacy, although adverse effects are more frequent and more severe with  xxxd71xxx . there is
not enough reliable evidence about other drugs used to treat discoid lupus erythematosus.

plain language summary
drugs for discoid lupus erythematosus
discoid lupus erythematosus (dle) is a severe form of skin inflammation which occurs particularly on sun-exposed skin. it can cause
permanent scarring but this can be prevented by early treatment. all forms of dle are common in women of childbearing age: this
is particularly important because some treatments, including thalidomide and retinoids, cause birth defects. the review found that
fluocinoinide cream is more effective than hydrocortisone.  xxxd2301xxx  and  xxxd71xxx  appear to work equally well, although
 xxxd71xxx  has more frequent and severe adverse effects. more research is needed to establish the best and safest treatment for dle.

background

description of the condition
discoid lupus erythematosus (dle) is a chronic and common
form of cutaneous lupus-a form of skin inflammation of unknown
cause. it occurs particularly on sun-exposed skin, such as the face,
ears and scalp, but occasionally is much more extensive, involving
large areas of skin. some people with dle have associated disease in other parts of the body, but the majority of people with
dle are otherwise healthy. people with dle are seen frequently
in skin clinics throughout the world. there have been no accurate studies of the prevalence of dle, although all forms of lupus
erythematosus are particularly common in women of childbearing age. the diagnosis of dle is usually made easily on clinical
grounds, characteristic clinical findings being erythema (redness),
follicular plugging (blocked and enlarged openings to hair follicles), pigmentary disturbances, telangiectasia (dilated capillaries),
and atrophy (skin thinning). when the diagnosis is in doubt a skin
biopsy (microscopic examination) may be required to confirm the
diagnosis.

emotional distress, social isolation and difficulty obtaining work
are problems frequently suffered by these patients. involvement of
the skin of the fingers and toes may markedly impair hand function and limit walking. in addition, people with dle are at risk
of developing squamous carcinoma in the scarred areas.
the antimalarial drug, chloroquine, is the traditional therapy
for dle (goldman 1953; brodthagen 1959; callen 1982). it is
cheap and readily available worldwide. flare-ups of systemic lupus were noted to occur with increased frequency after chloroquine was stopped (rothfield 1963). however, some people cannot tolerate the drug and it is known to fail in others. other antimalarial agents have been used, sometimes in combination with
chloroquine, but are not widely available (feldman 1994; kierland
1953; maguire 1962). many other agents have been used (callen
1997). sunscreens and sun avoidance may be beneficial but are
not usually sufficient alone. other possible treatments include
dapsone (coburn 1982; lindskov 1986), topical and intralesional
corticosteroids (ferguson smith 1986; jansen 1965; marsden
1968; reyman 1974), gold (dalziel 1986), clofazimine (mackey
1974), retinoids (ruzicka 1988; shornick 1991), methotrexate (goldstein 1994), azathioprine (tsokos 1985), thalidomide
(hasper 1983; knop 1983; naafs 1985),  xxxd3255xxx  (artuz
1996), phenytoin (rodriguez-c 1995) and  xxxg1137xxx -2a
(martinez 1992).

description of the intervention
early effective treatment may lead to total clearing of the skin lesions, but failure of treatment results in permanent scarring. the
depressed scars, hair loss and pigmentary changes are often extremely disfiguring, particularly in darker-skinned people. permanent scarring is the rule if treatment is delayed or inadequate. great

why it is important to do this review
the relative efficacies of these forms of treatment to placebo vehicle
or each other have not been clearly established. some of these
agents (such as the cytotoxics) are potentially very toxic. both

thalidomide and the retinoids are highly teratogenic (cause birth
defects when given to pregnant women), which renders their use
in fertile women problematic. it is this combination of uncertainty
of relative effectiveness and some potential to cause considerable
harm that has fuelled the need for this systematic review.

description of studies
see: characteristics of included studies; characteristics of excluded
studies.
fifty-four studies of treatment of discoid lupus erythematosus were
identified. of these, 24 were case reports, 26 were uncontrolled
trials and 4 were controlled trials, 2 of which were randomised.
diagnosis of dle was based on clinical judgement in all studies, none of the investigators requiring histological (skin biopsy)
confirmation. the two rcts met the criteria for inclusion in this
review.
the first study compared two steroid creams of different strengths
(roenigk 1980).  xxxd2129xxx  0.05%, and hydrocortisone 1%,
in the same cream base and identical tubes, were compared in
a 12 week cross-over trial. a single active lesion on each person
was chosen for monitoring. the sex, age, ethnic group (23 black
american, 25 white american in 1 group and 23 black american,
22 white american in the other), distribution (mainly face and
scalp),and duration of disease (1 to 294 months), were not significantly different in the 2 groups. the medication was applied to
the skin three times a day. clinical response was scored on a 5point scale, using a single test site. the scale provided a score of
1 if the lesion became worse, 2 if there was no improvement, 3
if there was a little improvement, 4 if improvement was marked
and 5 if the lesion cleared or showed excellent improvement. data
from 78 people were available for analysis at the end of the first
phase, (6 weeks), although only 59 people completed the whole
trial. fifteen people dropped out during the first phase, 13 because
of non-compliance and 2 because of the use of a proscribed drug.
of the 19 who failed to complete the second 6 weeks of the trial,
3 had cleared (1 on  xxxd2129xxx ), 2 had failed to improve (both
on hydrocortisone), and the other 14 were lost to follow up.
the second trial compared  xxxd2301xxx  400 to 1200 mg
daily and  xxxd71xxx  50 mg daily (ruzicka 1992). the group of 58

people included 39 with discoid lupus erythematosus and 19 with
subacute cutaneous lupus erythematosus. the age, sex ratio and
distribution of disease was equal in the 2 groups. the ethnic group
was not stated. the face was the commonest site of skin lesions.
assessment of severity was based on a scale using erythema (redness), infiltration (thickness), and scaling. extent of skin disease
and the occurrence of adverse reactions were also documented.
two further controlled trials were identified, but excluded from
the review because they were not randomised.
in the first trial  xxxd2128xxx  0.025% ointment was compared
with base in 20 participants (bjornberg 1963). participant and
observer were blinded; two sites on each person were used, one
for active and the other for placebo treatments. the ointment was
applied three times daily to each site. outcome measures were redness, scaling, infiltration and extent. the period of observation was
18 days.  xxxd2128xxx  ointment performed better than placebo
(significance < 0.05), but the study was flawed in that there was
no formal randomisation, the sample was small and the period of
study was very short.
in the second trial  xxxd2301xxx  was compared with
placebo (kraak 1965). alternate people were treated with active
agent and an identical inert tablet so that complete blinding of
participant and doctor was achieved. treatment was continued for
a year and was then crossed-over for a further three months. outcome measures were not precisely defined but participants were described as deteriorated, unchanged, improved or cured. five people
dropped out, one because they were cured (on active drug), three
because of intercurrent illness and one defaulted. in the active arm,
10 of 24 people were “cured”, while 5 of 25 were “cured” in the
placebo group. the authors used wilcoxon’s 2-sample statistical
test, which yielded a 2-tailed probability of kappa-squared = 0.011
after 3 months and 0.039 after a year, supporting the view that
 xxxd2301xxx  was more effective than placebo. side-effects
were mainly gastrointestinal, (eight in active group and three in
placebo group), but one person developed severe retinopathy on
 xxxd2301xxx , with permanently reduced vision. the dose
of  xxxd2301xxx  given to this person (1200 mg per day),
far exceeded the currently recommended dose, (4 to 6 mg per kg
bodyweight per day). this study was flawed by the non-randomisation, the poorly defined outcome measures and the high drug
dosage.

risk of bias in included studies
1. the topical steroid study was randomised and statistical
tests for equality confirmed that randomisation was successful.
blinding was clearly stated. participants were matched for age,
ethnic group and severity of monitored lesion. seventy-eight of
93 people (84%), completed the study to the 6 week analysis
point, 37 using  xxxd2129xxx  and 41 using hydrocortisone. the
outcome was recorded on a 5-point scale, but parameters of the
score were not clearly stated. the trial was short (six weeks in

each arm), and thus side-effects of long-term topical steroid use
could not be assessed.
2. in the study comparing  xxxd2301xxx  and  xxxd71xxx ,
60 people were enrolled, 28 in the  xxxd71xxx  group and 30 in the
 xxxd2301xxx  group. participants were randomised but
methods of allocation and blinding were not clearly stated. the
two groups were comparable with regard to age, sex ratio,
previous treatment, distribution of skin lesions and severity.
fifty-one people completed the trial (83%). among those given
 xxxd71xxx  four people dropped-out because of side-effects, another
because of treatment failure and a sixth due to non-compliance.
in the  xxxd2301xxx  group three people withdrew from
the study prematurely because of complete clearing of skin
lesions and one because of failure of treatment. the small sample
size makes interpretation of the data difficult. a further flaw of
this study was the inclusion of 19 people with subacute
cutaneous lupus erythematosus. as these people were more
strongly represented in the chloroquine group, this might have
influenced the outcome of treatment as people with subacute
lupus may have a better response rate. the response rates for
discoid lupus and subacute lupus were not described separately.

effects of interventions
1.  xxxd2129xxx  0.05% cream appeared to be superior to
hydrocortisone 1% cream in the treatment of discoid lupus
erythematosus. at the 6-week cross-over point, clearing or
excellent improvement was found in 10 of 37 people (27%)
using  xxxd2129xxx  and in 4 of 41 (10%) using hydrocortisone.
this shows an absolute benefit of potent steroid of 17% (95%
ci 0.3 to 34.2, nnt 6). these findings were confirmed in the
second treatment period. all of the patients who improved with
hydrocortisone initially continued to improve when changed to
 xxxd2129xxx , however 19 patients improved when using
 xxxd2129xxx  but did not maintain this improvement when using
hydrocortisone. adverse effects were minor and were seen in
both groups. skin irritation occurred in three people using
hydrocortisone and burning in two people using  xxxd2129xxx .
one person in the hydrocortisone group developed acne. the
trial was too short to assess other side-effects, such as skin
atrophy (thinning) or capillary damage.
2. in the  xxxd2301xxx  and  xxxd71xxx  study, the overall
outcome appeared similar in the two groups. there was marked
improvement or complete clearing in 13 of 28 (46%) patients
given  xxxd71xxx  and in 15 of 30 (50%) of those on
 xxxd2301xxx ; i.e. there was no significant difference
between the 2 groups. erythema showed more marked
improvement in the  xxxd2301xxx  group and more people
in this group showed complete clearing. adverse effects were
more frequent in the  xxxd71xxx  group and were more severe, with
four patients having to discontinue treatment because of adverse
effects. the main clinical adverse effects were dry lips/cheilitis

(93% of  xxxd71xxx  and 20% of  xxxd2301xxx  group) and
gastrointestinal disturbance (11%  xxxd71xxx  and 17%
 xxxd2301xxx  group). laboratory studies revealed changes
in triglycerides in both groups, the levels rising from a mean of
1.66 to 2.10 mmol/l in the  xxxd71xxx  group (p = 0.01) and falling
from 1.94 to 1.50 mmol/l in the  xxxd2301xxx  group (p =
0.02). the difference between the two groups was highly
significant (p = 0.006).

discussion
the study of topical steroids provides evidence that high potency
fluorinated steroid creams may be superior to low potency hydrocortisone in the treatment of discoid lupus erythematosus. however the small numbers, short duration and high drop-out rate
make the results of this trial difficult to interpret with confidence.
the ideal duration of treatment or likelihood of recurrences following treatment has not been established.
in the comparative trial of  xxxd2301xxx  and  xxxd71xxx  no
difference in efficacy was demonstrated between the two drugs.
the small numbers in this trial may weaken the validity of this
study. the inclusion of patients with subacute cutaneous lupus
erythematosus is an even greater source of possible error and the
results require confirmation.
choroquine has long been considered the ’gold-standard’ in the
treatment of discoid lupus erythematosus (goldman 1953). in recent years,  xxxd2301xxx  has been used in place of chloroquine in many countries, because ocular side effects were reported
to be less frequent with  xxxd2301xxx . the efficacy of the
two forms of the drug is thought to be the same but no trials exist
to confirm this in dle. in discussing the treatment of dle in
1961 prakken commented that “this [lack of evidence] is illustrated by a survey of our literature on the treatment of chronic lupus erythematosus. although many papers agree on their reports
of favourable results, the value of our therapy remains doubtful
because the influence of the placebo effect and the publications
effect has not been eliminated.” (prakken 1961). however rees
felt that discoid lupus responded so dramatically to chloroquine
that “double-blind studies are not required” (rees 1963). in 1964
kraak performed a literature search and concluded that available
information was insufficient to evaluate the many therapies that
are recommended; “the literature leaves room for the alarming
assumption that none of the drugs might do any good” (kraak
1964). his group performed a non-randomised double-blind trial
comparing  xxxd2301xxx  with placebo (kraak 1965). spontaneous improvement or clearing occurred in some of their patients, particularly in the winter months. the group on chloroquine showed a greater tendency to improve and this finding now
needs to be confirmed in a randomised controlled trial. other
workers have been so concerned about possible ocular side-effects,

5

(very rare on current low dosage regimens), that chloroquine was
excluded from their trial (mackey 1974). unfortunately many of
the other agents, reported anecdotally to be of value in discoid
lupus erythematosus, have considerable potential side-effects and
many may produce major malformations in the foetus if taken
during pregnancy. it is clearly important to obtain valid evidence
of the efficacy of these agents in order to treat patients effectively
without exposing them to undue hazards.

authors’ conclusions
implications for practice
1. small numbers and short duration reduce the strength of
these trials and the results need to be confirmed in larger trials.
2. high potency steroid cream appears to be more effective
than low potency steroid cream in the treatment of discoid lupus
erythematosus, although, at best, it appears to be effective for
only about half the people treated.
3. both  xxxd2301xxx  and  xxxd71xxx  are associated with
marked improvement or clearing in about half of all people
treated, although neither drug has been tested against placebo.
adverse events such as dry lips were troublesome in nearly all
people in the  xxxd71xxx  group.
4. at present there is no reliable evidence to support the use of
other specific treatments for discoid lupus erythematosus. this
should not be seen as evidence that current treatment is
ineffective but rather that evidence of effectiveness is lacking.
5. there is currently insufficient evidence to guide clinicians
in the treatment of severe dle.

implications for research
the early single lesion of dle may respond well to potent steroid
creams. for the person with severe, resistant or recurrent lesions
more evidence is needed to allow the clinician to choose the best

treatment. one of the goals should be to prevent scarring as, once
it occurs, it is largely irreversible.
well-planned randomised controlled trials are needed to provide
a guide to the treatment of discoid lupus erythematosus. trials
should not mix different types of lupus together and ideally the
diagnosis should be confirmed with a skin biopsy. there is a need
for trials comparing topical steroids with other agents. the outcome measures should be stated clearly and should include participants views and information about scarring. the trials should
be of sufficient duration to allow for seasonal variation and capture of relapses (suggest minimum of nine months). recurrence
rate on and off treatment and occurrence of side-effects should be
documented. priorities for further studies are as follows:
i) potent topical steroid versus chloroquine/  xxxd2301xxx 
(this agent is cheap, widely available and safe if recommended
guidelines are followed)
ii) potent topical steroid versus oral retinoid (more expensive and
can cause birth defects)
iii) potent topical steroid versus methotrexate (cheap and available
but possible liver and bone marrow toxicity; needs careful monitoring)
iv) potent topical steroid versus thalidomide (not widely available
and can cause birth defects and neurological toxicity)
