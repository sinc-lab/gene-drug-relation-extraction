this article reviews the pharmacological profile and published efficacy and tolerability/safety
data of  xxxd2330xxx , asenapine and  xxxd2518xxx , the most recent atypical antipsychotics to
be approved in the usa for the treatment of schizophrenia. all three agents are similar in
terms of overall efficacy and low propensity for clinically significant weight gain or adverse
changes in glycemic or lipid profile. however, these agents differ from one another in terms
of formulations, pharmacokinetics, and dosing and nonmetabolic adverse effect profile. for
each drug, comparative and real-world effectiveness studies are lacking, as are effectiveness
and safety data in elderly, young and pregnant/nursing patients. as such, the exact place
of  xxxd2330xxx , asenapine and  xxxd2518xxx  within the broader antipsychotic armamentarium is
currently difficult to establish.

schizophrenia is a serious, chronic psychiatric
disorder with a lifetime prevalence of approx­
imately 1% worldwide and major adverse consequences [1] . these include profound impairments in cognition, social functioning and
work capacity [2–4] , and increased risk of early
mortality owing to poor physical health and suicide [5–7] . although there is currently no cure
for schizophrenia, many of its most distressing
clinical signs and symptoms can be managed
with the long-term use of antipsychotic medication in conjunction with effective psychosocial
interventions [8] .
antipsychotic drug treatment has remained
the centerpiece of both acute and long-term
management of schizophrenia for the last several decades. goals of pharmacotherapy with
anti­psychotic drugs include amelioration of
severe psychotic symptoms (such as hallucinations, delusions, disorganized behaviors and
aggression/­hostility) during acute-phase treatment; prevention of acute symptom exacerbations and reduction of nonpsychotic signs and
symptoms of schizophrenia (e.g., negative or

‘deficit’ signs and symptoms, depression, and
so on) during maintenance-phase treatment;
and to improve quality of life and psychosocial
functioning as the overarching goal [9] .
antipsychotic drugs are broadly classified into
two groups: typical and atypical [10] . typical and
atypical antipsychotic drugs approved for clinical
use in the usa share a common mechanism of
action – blockade of central dopamine d2 neuroreceptors [10] – with the one exception being aripiprazole, an atypical antipsychotic and partial
d2 agonist [11] . both typical and atypical antipsychotics are effective for reducing symptoms and
preventing relapse in adults with schizophrenia
[12,13] . in this respect, differences in efficacy
between antipsychotics is thought to be modest,
with the exception of superior effectiveness of the
atypical antipsychotic, clozapine, for treatmentresistant schizophrenia [14,15] . atypical antipsychotics are distinguished clinically from typical
antipsychotics by lower propensity for causing
antidopaminergic side effects (including extrapyramidal symptoms [eps] and prolactin elevation)
and lower long-term risk of tardive dyskinesia at

clinically relevant doses [10] . nearly all atypical antipsychotics are
potent antagonists at serotonin 5-ht2a neuroreceptors, a property
not shared by the typical neuroleptics [16] .
currently, ten atypical antipsychotic drugs are approved and
marketed in the usa for the treatment of schizophrenia in adults.
of these, the most recently approved are  xxxd2330xxx  (fanapttm,
vanda pharmaceuticals, md, usa; approved in may 2009),
asenapine (saphristm, schering-plough, kenilworth, nj, usa;
approved in august 2009) and  xxxd2518xxx  (latudatm, sunovion
pharmaceuticals, inc., marlborough, ma, usa; approved in
october 2010). after a several year hiatus, these agents arrived
on the market in relatively short order, with relatively limited
availability outside of the usa. for example, of the three, only
asenapine has regulatory approval by the ema and in the uk
for treating manic or mixed episodes associated with bipolar i
disorder, although the ema is considering an application for
marketing authorization for  xxxd2330xxx . as such, the role of  xxxd2330xxx , asenapine and  xxxd2518xxx  for treating patients with
schizophrenia, as well as important differences between each
agent, may be unknown to many clinicians. this paper provides
a review of the pharmacological properties of these three atypical
antipsychotic drugs, discussed in order of approval in the usa,
and the results of available published acute- and maintenancephase studies in adults with schizophrenia. added commentary
on the place of asenapine,  xxxd2330xxx  and  xxxd2518xxx  among the
other pharmacotherapeutic options for schizophrenia treatment,
is also included.
pharmacological profile
pharmacodynamics

 xxxd2330xxx  exhibits high affinity for dopamine d2 and d3, and
serotonin 5-ht2a receptors, where they act as antagonists (table 1)
[17–19] , a pattern consistent with its atypical antipsychotic profile;
however, the functional significance of  xxxd2330xxx ’s antagonist
activity at dopamine d3 receptors is unknown.  xxxd2330xxx  binds
with moderate affinity to dopamine d4, serotonin  xxxg1119xxx  and
5-ht 7, and noradrenergic  xxxg87xxx   xxxg830xxx  receptors; and with low affinity
to dopamine d1, serotonin 5-ht1a and histamine h1 receptors
[17,18] .  xxxd2330xxx  has no significant binding activity at muscarinic
cholinergic m1 receptors [18] .  xxxd2330xxx  functions as an anta­
gonist at noradrenergic  xxxg87xxx   xxxg830xxx  receptors, which predicts its orthostatic
hypotensive effects [17,18] .
asenapine, like most other atypical antipsychotics, is also a
potent antagonist at dopamine d2 and serotonin 5-ht2a receptors (table 1) [17,20] . asenapine also binds potently to serotonin
5-ht1a, 5-ht2c,  xxxg1119xxx ,  xxxg1120xxx , histamine h1 and noradrenergic
 xxxg87xxx   xxxg830xxx  receptors, but has negligible affinity for muscarinic m1 receptors [17,20,201] . with the exception of muscarinic m1 receptors,
asenapine behaves as a potent antagonist at each of these sites [21] .
there is evidence that asenapine acts as a partial agonist at 5-ht1a
receptors [22] . interestingly, weight gain with asenapine during
short- and long-term clinical studies has been modest despite its
potent serotonin 5-ht2c and  xxxg1078xxx  antagonist
profile (reviewed below) [23,24] . in addition, clinical studies of
asenapine document a low incidence of orthostatic hypotension
62

and dizziness despite asenapine’s potent antagonist effects at
noradrenergic  xxxg87xxx   xxxg830xxx  receptors [25] .
 xxxd2518xxx  also binds with high affinity to dopamine d2 and
serotonin 5-ht2a receptors, and to 5-ht 7 receptors (table 1) [26] .
as shown in table 1,  xxxd2518xxx  binds with marginally higher
affinity to d2 than 5-ht2a receptors.  xxxd2518xxx  has moderate
binding affinity for serotonin 5-ht1a receptors; weak affinity for
noradrenergic  xxxg87xxx   xxxg830xxx  and alpha2c, and serotonin 5-ht2c receptors; and
no significant binding activity at histamine h1 or muscarinic m1
receptors [26] .  xxxd2518xxx  acts as an antagonist at d2 and serotonin
5-ht2a and  xxxg1120xxx  receptors, and a partial agonist at serotonin
5-ht1a receptors [26] .
pharmacokinetics & metabolism

 xxxd2330xxx  is formulated as solid tablets for oral administration, the available milligram strengths are listed in table 2 [202] .
 xxxd2330xxx  is well absorbed from the gi tract and peak plasma
concentrations are reached within 2–4 hours [202] . administration
with food has no significant effect on the area under the curve, tmax
or cmax [27] . steady-state concentration is reached within 3–4 days
of initial dosing [202] .  xxxd2330xxx  is ~95% protein bound, and is
extensively metabolized in the liver via cyp2d6 and cyp3a4
[28] . the mean elimination half-life of  xxxd2330xxx  is 18 hours
for cyp2d6 extensive metabolizers, and 33 hours for slow
metabolizers [202] . one of  xxxd2330xxx ’s two primary metabolites
(p88‑8991) has a receptor binding profile similar to that of the
parent compound, while the other (p95-12113) does not appear
to cross the blood–brain barrier to a significant degree [29] .
asenapine is formulated as a rapidly dissolving tablet for sublingual or buccal administration (table 2) [203] . thus, the primary
site of drug absorption is the oral mucosa, which results in a bioavailability of approximately 35%. swallowing the tablet reduces
bioavailability to <2%. asenapine is rapidly absorbed, and reaches
peak plasma concentration within 0.5–1.5 hours [203] . however,
drinking liquids within 10 minutes of sublingual administration of asenapine can significantly reduce its bioavailability; thus,
avoidance of eating or drinking within 10 minutes of asenapine
administration is recommended [203] . steady-state concentrations
are reached within 3 days if administered twice daily (b.i.d.).
asenapine is highly (95%) protein bound, undergoes direct glucuronidation by  xxxg2381xxx  and is metabolized in the liver by the
cyp1a2 isoenzyme (to a lesser degree by cyp3a4, followed by
cyp2d6) [30,203] . asenapine is converted to several metabolites
[30] , none of which are thought to contribute significantly to its
overall pharma­cological profile. the mean elimination half-life
of asenapine is 13–39 hours. severe hepatic impairment (child–
pugh class c), but not mild to moderate impairment (child–pugh
classes a or b, respectively), results in profound increases in asenapine concentration, while no degree of renal impairment appears to
result in increased asenapine exposure [31] . as such, the product
label recommends against the use of asenapine for patients with
severe hepatic impairment, while no adjustment of dose appears
warranted based on renal function [203] .
 xxxd2518xxx  is formulated as a solid oral tablet and is rapidly
absorbed, reaching peak plasma concentration in 1–3 hours

recently approved antipsychotic drugs for schizophrenia

clinically effective doses [204] . strong inhibitors of cyp2d6
(i.e., fluoxetine, paroxetine, and so on) or cyp3a4 (i.e., ketoconazole, clarithromycin, and so on) can significantly delay the
metabolism and elimination of  xxxd2330xxx , leading to elevated
 xxxd2330xxx  blood levels (table 2) [202] . thus, the total daily dose
of  xxxd2330xxx  will need to be reduced (by 50%, according to the
manufacturing label) if used in the presence of strong cyp2d6
and 3a4 inhibitors [202] . coadministering  xxxd2330xxx  with other
qt-prolonging drugs should be avoided (table 2) [202] .  xxxd2330xxx 
is not recommended for use in patients with hepatic impairment.
because renal impairment and smoking status are unlikely to
significantly alter drug levels in absence of other pharmacokinetic
factors [28,202] , dosage adjustment is not likely to be required.
asenapine

the recommended starting dose for asenapine is 5 mg b.i.d.,
with an effective dose range of 5–10 mg b.i.d. [203] . as noted
above, asenapine is formulated for sublingual use. thus, the tablets should not be split to allow for single doses under 5 mg, nor
should they be crushed, chewed or swallowed. the risk of clinically significant drug–drug interactions involving asenapine has
not been extensively evaluated. caution is advised when administering asenapine with cyp1a2 inhibitors (i.e., fluvoxamine,
and so on), which may significantly increase asenapine exposure
[203] . asenapine is a weak cyp2d6 inhibitor, and may increase
exposure to drugs that are cyp2d6 substrates (such as paroxetine). thus, caution is also advised when combining asenapine
with other drugs that act as both substrates and inhibitors for
cyp2d6 (table 2) [203] . because asenapine acts as a potent nor­
adrenergic  xxxg87xxx   xxxg830xxx  receptor antagonist [17] , blood pressure and orthostatic symptom monitoring may be required when combining
asenapine with antihypertensive drugs, particularly those with
anti-adrenergic properties (table 2) . asenapine is not recommended
for use in patients with severe hepatic impairment (child–pugh
class c), while dosage adjustment is not required based solely on
level of renal impairment [31] . smoking has not been shown to
si­gnificantly alter asenapine exposure [34] .
 xxxd2518xxx 

the recommended starting dose of  xxxd2518xxx  is 40 mg daily,
and recent changes to product labeling reflect an expanded effective dose range of 40–160 mg daily [204] . all  xxxd2518xxx  doses
should be taken with food (>350 calories), as also reflected in
the current product labeling [204] . caution is recommended when
coadministering  xxxd2518xxx  with moderate cyp3a4 inhibitors,
with an upper dose limit of 40 mg/day (table 2) [204] . combining
 xxxd2518xxx  with potent cyp3a4 inducers (i.e., rifampin, and so
on) or inhibitors (i.e., diltiazepin, and so on) is contraindicated,
as these interactions can significantly alter exposure to  xxxd2518xxx  (table 2) [204] . the manufacturer has recommended against
prescribing  xxxd2518xxx  at doses above 40 mg daily in patients
with moderate or severe hepatic impairment, or with severe renal
impairment [204] . because  xxxd2518xxx  is not a cyp1a2 substrate,
smoking is not expected to alter drug levels in absence of other
pharmacokinetic factors.

clinical efficacy
acute-phase treatment
 xxxd2330xxx 

a summary of results from four short-term, multi-site, randomized, controlled efficacy studies of  xxxd2330xxx  in adults (aged
18–65 years) with acute schizophrenia is presented in table 3. the
first study by cutler et al. was a 4-week, phase iii study of 606
patients randomized to fixed doses of  xxxd2330xxx  (12 mg b.i.d.),
ziprasidone (160 mg daily) or placebo [35] . eligible patients had
clinical global impression-severity (cgi-s) [36] scores >4 (indicating at least moderate illness severity) at baseline, a positive and
negative syndrome scale (panss) [37] total score of >70, and
ratings of >4 on at least two panss positive symptom items (hallucinations, delusions, suspiciousness/persecution and conceptual
disorganization) at screening and at baseline. study drugs were
titrated to their target doses over 7 days.  xxxd2330xxx  and ziprasidone resulted in significantly greater improvement in panss-total
scores, the primary efficacy end point, compared with placebo
(table 3) . similar results were observed for panss-positive and
-negative subscale, and cgi-s scores. a significantly higher proportion of  xxxd2330xxx -treated patients were classified as positive
treatment responders (table 3) , defined as those who achieved a
>20% reduction in panss-positive symptom subscale scores from
baseline. neither  xxxd2330xxx  nor ziprasidone treatment resulted in
significantly greater improvement in calgary depression scale for
schizophrenia (cdss) [38] scores compared with placebo.
another report by potkin et al. summarized results of three
6-week, phase iii, randomized, double-blind, placebo- and
active comparator-controlled trials of identical design (studies 1,
2 and 3) [39] . results were presented for each study separately
(table 3) , and in a pooled data analysis. in all studies, eligible subjects had a diagnosis of schizophrenia and a panss total score
of >60 at screening and baseline. randomization occurred following a 3-day placebo run-in period. study drugs were titrated
to target doses over the first 7 days of follow-up. in study 1,
621 patients were randomly assigned to receive one of three fixed
doses of  xxxd2330xxx  (2, 4 or 6 mg b.i.d.), haloperidol (15 mg daily)
or placebo [39] . compared with placebo, there was significantly
greater improvement in panss total scores with  xxxd2330xxx  6 mg
b.i.d. and with haloperidol (table 3) . improvements in panss total
scores with 4 or 8 mg of  xxxd2330xxx  were not significantly greater
than with placebo.  xxxd2330xxx  6 mg b.i.d. and haloperidol (but

groups were associated with significantly greater improvement in
panss total and subscale scores (table 3) .
a pooled analysis of studies 1–3 [39] examined the combined effects of each  xxxd2330xxx  dose group (4–8, 10–16 or
20–14 mg/day), haloperidol, risperidone, or placebo on baselineto-end point change in bprs scores. the pooled data set consisted
of 1,553 patients who had at least 2 weeks of post-randomization
follow-up. all active treatment groups, including all three  xxxd2330xxx  dose ranges, were associated with significantly greater
improvement in bprs scores, relative to placebo. in another
pooled analysis that included data from all four prospective,
randomized, double-blind, placebo- and active-controlled trials
of patients with schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder, significantly greater improvement in panss total, panss-positive
and -negative subscale, and bprs scores was also reported with
 xxxd2330xxx  (10–16 and 20–24 mg/day) compared with placebo
[41] . similar results were obtained when the data from patients
with schizoaffective disorder were excluded.
asenapine

the efficacy of asenapine for acute-phase treatment of schizo­
phrenia has been demonstrated in two randomized, phase iii,
multi-site, double-blind, placebo- and active comparator-controlled trials (table 4) . potkin et al. conducted a 6-week randomized, fixed-dose study of asenapine 10 mg/day (5 mg b.i.d.),
risperidone 6 mg (3 mg b.i.d.) or placebo [42] . eligible patients
were adults (>18 years of age) with acutely exacerbated schizophrenia (n = 182 randomized subjects), defined by baseline cgi-s
scores of >4, panss total score of >60, and a score >4 on at least
two panss‑positive subscale items (hallucinations, delusions,
suspiciousness/persecution, grandiosity or conceptual disorganization). eligible subjects also had to have had a prior history of
positive anti­psychotic drug treatment response. study drugs were
titrated to target dose over 3–5 days. all asenapine-treated subjects also received two solid oral placebo tablets, while risperidonetreated subjects also received sublingual placebo. patients in the
placebo group received both solid oral and sublingual placebo
b.i.d. formulations. baseline-to-end point improvement in panss
total scores, the primary study end point, was significantly greater
with asenapine than placebo but not with risperidone (table 4) .
significantly greater decreases in panss total scores in the
asenapine group (vs placebo) were observed beginning at week 2
and continued through the end of the study period. as compared with placebo, both asenapine and risperidone resulted in
significantly greater improvement in panss-positive subscale and
cgi-s scores (table 4) [42] . however, only asenapine resulted in significantly greater improvement in panss-negative and -general
psychopathology subscale scores, compared with placebo (table 4) .
in a second 6-week study by kane et al., 458 patients (aged
18 years or older) with acutely exacerbated schizophrenia were
randomized to receive one of two fixed doses of asenapine (5 or
10 mg b.i.d.), haloperidol (4 mg b.i.d.) or placebo [43] . eligible
subjects had a panss total score of >60, a score of >4 on at
least two panss-positive subscale items (delusions, hallucinations, suspiciousness/persecution, grandiosity, or conceptual
68

disorganization) and cgi-s score of >4 at baseline. in the primary
last-observation-carried-forward analysis, asenapine 5 mg b.i.d.
and haloperidol, but not asenapine 10 mg b.i.d., resulted in significantly greater baseline-to-end point improvement in panss total
scores (the primary efficacy end point) and panss-positive subscale scores (table 4) [43] . advantages of asenapine 5 mg b.i.d. and
haloperidol over placebo on panss-total and -positive subscale
scores were apparent beginning at week 3, and continued throughout the remainder of the study period. all active treatments were
superior to placebo on change in panss marder positive factor
scores (table 4) [44] . only asenapine (5 mg b.i.d.) resulted in significantly greater improvement in panss-negative and -general
psychopathology subscale scores, while no active treatment was
superior to placebo for change in panss marder negative factor
scores (table 4) . only haloperidol was associated with significantly
greater improvement in panss marder hostility/excitement factor scores than placebo, and only asenapine 5 mg b.i.d. was associated with greater improvement in panss marder disorganized
thought processes factor (table 4) . both asenapine dose groups,
but not the haloperidol group, were associated with a significantly higher proportion of positive treatment response, defined
a priori as a >30% decrease from baseline in panss total scores
(table 4) . a significantly higher proportion of subjects achieving a
cgi-improvement score of 1 (very much improved) or 2 (much
improved) was observed in the asenapine 5 mg b.i.d. group, but
not the asenapine 10 mg b.i.d. or ­haloperidol groups, relative to
placebo (table 4) .
it is worth noting that the acute-phase efficacy of asenapine in
adults with schizophrenia has been evaluated in two additional
6-week placebo-controlled trials that also included olanzapine as
an active control group [45] . the first study compared the efficacy
of two fixed doses of asenapine with olanzapine or placebo. only
olanzapine (15 mg daily) resulted in significant baseline-to-end
point decreases in panss total score, compared with placebo. as
such, this was considered a negative trial for asenapine. the second study compared the clinical effects of flexibly dosed asenapine
(5–10 mg b.i.d.), olanzapine (10–20 mg b.i.d.) and placebo. in
this study, neither active treatment group showed significantly
greater improvement in panss total scores, the primary efficacy
variable, than placebo. as such, this was considered a failed trial.
 xxxd2518xxx 

the short-term, acute-phase efficacy of  xxxd2518xxx  for the treatment of schizophrenia in adults has been evaluated in several
6-week double-blind, placebo-controlled trials (of which three
were phase ii studies) [33,46] . one phase ii [47] and one phase iii [48]
study have been published (table 5) . one 6-week, phase ii,
­placebo-controlled study (with an additional haloperidol-­treated
arm for assay s­ensitivity) was considered a failed trial [46] .
in the first phase ii study conducted in the usa, 149 patients
with acute schizophrenia were randomized to one of two fixed
doses of  xxxd2518xxx  (40 or 120 mg/day) or placebo [46] . no active
control group was included in this study. significantly greater

in a second usa phase ii study published by nakamura et al.,
180 patients (aged 18 to 65 years) with an acute exacerbation of
schizophrenia were randomized to receive  xxxd2518xxx  at a fixed

(pearl 1) compared the efficacy of  xxxd2518xxx  at one of three
fixed doses (40, 80, or 120 mg/day) with placebo in a 6-week,
multination (51 sites worldwide), randomized study of 500
patients with acute schizophrenia [46] . the primary efficacy end
point was baseline-to-end point change in panss total scores;
change in cgi-s score was a secondary measure.  xxxd2518xxx 
80 mg/day, but not 40 or 120 mg/day, resulted in significantly
greater improvement in panss total and cgi-s scores, as compared with placebo. significantly greater improvement in pansspositive subscale scores and a significantly higher proportion of
positive treatment responders (e.g., persons who achieved a >30%
decrease in panss total scores from baseline) were observed for
both the 80-and 120-mg/day  xxxd2518xxx  dose groups, compared
with placebo.
meltzer et al. published results of the second phase iii
study (pearl 2), in which 478 patients were randomized
to one of four fixed-dose treatment groups:  xxxd2518xxx  (40 or
120 mg/day), olanzapine (15 mg/day) or placebo [48] . eligible
subjects had a mini-international neuropsychiatric interviewconfirmed diagnosis of schizophrenia, and a cgi-s score >4,
panss total score >80, and a score of >4 on at least two

panss-positive subscale items (delusions, hallucinations, suspiciousness/persecution, unusual thought content, or conceptual
disorganization), at baseline [52] . baseline-to-end point improvement in panss total scores, the primary efficacy end point,
was significantly greater for all of the active treatment groups,
compared with the placebo group (table 5) . superiority of  xxxd2518xxx  40 mg and olanzapine over placebo on panss total score
reduction was observed from week 1 onward, while significantly
greater improvement in this effect measure for  xxxd2518xxx  120 mg
was observed from week 3 onward. similar results for all active
treatment groups were observed on secondary efficacy measures,
including baseline to end point change in panss-positive, -negative, -general psychopathology and cgi-s scores (table 5) . only
the olanzapine group experienced significantly greater baselineto-end point improvement in madrs scores than the placebo
group (table 5) . a significantly higher proportion of olanzapine but
not  xxxd2518xxx  treated patients were considered positive treatment
responders (table 5) .
the final phase iii trial (pearl 3) compared the effects of
two  xxxd2518xxx  fixed doses (80 and 160 mg/day) with placebo
and quetiapine xr (600 mg/day) in adults with acute schizophrenia over 6 weeks [46,51,53] . all active treatments were associated
with significant improvement from baseline to study end point
in panss total scores, the primary efficacy end point, as well
was cgi-s scores, compared with placebo. significant improvement in panss total scores for both  xxxd2518xxx  dose groups was
observed at day 4 and persisted throughout the remainder of the
study period. improvements in mean panss total scores from
baseline were significantly greater with  xxxd2518xxx  80-mg (-22.2),
 xxxd2518xxx  160-mg (-26.5) group, and quetiapine xr (-27.8),
compared with placebo (-10.3, p < 0.001 for all comparisons)
[53] . all active treatments resulted in significantly greater improvement than placebo in depressive symptoms, as assessed by the
montgomery asberg depression rating scale [54] (p < 0.001 for
all comparisons).
longer-term studies
 xxxd2330xxx 

the long-term safety and efficacy of  xxxd2330xxx  was evaluated
in three 52-week, randomized, double-blind, multicenter trials.
pooled data from these studies have been published [55] . each of
the studies were identical in design and compared the clinical
effects of flexibly dosed  xxxd2330xxx  (4–16 mg/day) and haloperidol (5–20 mg/day) in patients with schizophrenia or schizo­
affective disorder. a total of 1,239 patients were randomized to
 xxxd2330xxx  and 405 to haloperidol during an initial 6-week,
double-blind treatment phase. those who completed the initial
treatment phase and achieved a positive treatment response ( xxxd2330xxx : n = 371; haloperidol: n = 118) were eligible for the
46-week double-blind maintenance phase.
relapse was defined on the basis of worsening symptoms
(increase in panss total scores of >25% or >10 points compared with panss total scores taken at the end of the initial
6-week phase), global clinical state (increase in clinical global
impression of change scores by >2 points), hospitalization

because of psychotic symptom exacerbation or discontinuation
of study medication owing to lack of efficacy [55] . maintenance
phase relapse rates were very similar between the  xxxd2330xxx  and
haloperidol treatment groups (43.5 vs 41.2%; table 6). mean time
to relapse was slightly longer with haloperidol (101.8 days) than
 xxxd2330xxx  (89.8 days); however, this difference was not statistically significant. assuming a relapse rate of 30% with haloperidol,
the statistical threshold for equivalence between  xxxd2330xxx  and
haloperidol (hazard ratio < 1.676  xxxd2216xxx  [one-sided] = 0.025) was
achieved in the pooled data set. baseline-to-end point improvement panss-positive subscale scores were greater with haloperidol (table 6) ; however, there were no significant between-group
differences in other secondary end points, including panss total
and other subscale scores, bprs scores, rate of discontinuation
for ­unsatisfactory therapeutic effect, or rates of positive treatment
response.
asenapine

two published randomized studies focused on the long-term efficacy and safety of asenapine in adults with schizophrenia [56,57] ,
including one relapse prevention study [56] . two additional reports
summarized the extension-phase results of trials comparing the
effectiveness of asenapine and olanzapine [58,59] , one of which
focused on primary negative symptoms [59] . in the relapse prevention study [56] , 700 patients were treated with open-label sublingual asenapine (10 mg b.i.d.) for up to 26 weeks. patients who
were clinically stable at the end of the open-label phase were randomized to double-blind continuation treatment with sub­lingual
asenapine or placebo for an additional 26 weeks. relapse was the
primary end point and was broadly defined (table 6 , footnote)
on the basis of symptom worsening, worsening global clinical
state, or the emergence of violent or suicidal behaviors. during
double-blind treatment, 12.1% of asenapine-treated patients and
47.4% of placebo-treated patients in the intent-to-treat population
experienced a relapse event (p < 0.0001). mean time to relapse
(p < 0.0001) and first quartile of the time to relapse (asenapine,
156 days vs placebo, 41 days) was significantly longer with asenapine than with placebo. rates of all-cause discontinuation were
also higher with placebo (62.5%) than with asenapine (30.4%).
changes from baseline in favor of asenapine were observed for
all secondary measures, including panss total, panss marder
factor [44] , cgi-s and cdss scores (table 6) .
a second randomized, double-blind, multisite study evaluated
the long-term (52 week) tolerability of asenapine (5–10 mg b.i.d.,
n = 913) or olanzapine (10–20 mg daily, n = 312) in adults with
schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder, and a baseline panss
total score of >60 (including scores of >4 on two or more pansspositive subscale items) [57] . patients who completed the 52-week
core study were given the option of continuing treatment until the
study blind was broken (extension study). clinical symptoms (as
measured by the panss total and marder factors), global clinical
state (cgi-s) and other effectiveness measures (subjective wellbeing under neuroleptic treatment [60] and medical outcomes
study 12-item short form [61]) were examined as secondary end
points. improvements in panss total scores were similar between

followed for an additional 327 ± 139.6 days (range: 15–631 days).
during the extension phase, only minor additional changes in
mean panss total scores were observed in both groups (asenapine [+1.6], olanzapine [−0.8]). no significant further change in
panss subscales, panss marder factors, and cgi or cdss
scores were observed in either treatment group.
one additional report by buchanan et al. presented the combined results of two identically-designed 26-week extension
studies that evaluated the long-term efficacy of asenapine and
olanzapine on persisting primary negative symptoms [59] . eligible
participants had a diagnosis of schizophrenia, baseline panssnegative subscale score of >20 and a score of >4 on at least three of
seven panss negative symptom factor items (affective blunting,
emotional withdrawal, passive social withdrawal, active social
avoidance, poor rapport, motor retardation, or lack of spontaneity). each study was conducted in two phases (a 26-week, doubleblind core phase, followed by a 26-week double-blind extension
phase). in the extension phase, patients were continued on their
core study regimens. there were no significant between-group
differences in negative symptom change, as measured by 16-item
negative symptom assessment scale (nsa-16) [62] , panssnegative symptom subscale, or panss marder negative factor
items [44] at 26 weeks (core studies). improvement in panss
-positive subscale and panss positive symptom factor scores was
noted in both groups, with greater improvement occurring in the
olanzapine group. in one of the two extension studies, baselineto-end point change in nsa-16 scores (-15.8 vs -11.0; p = 0.03)
and panss marder negative factor scores (-9.2 vs -7.4; p < 0.05)
were significantly greater with asenapine than olanzapine, while
improvement in panss-positive subscale scores was greater with
olanzapine than asenapine (-0.4 vs -1.5; p = 0.04). there were
no significant between-group differences on the panss-negative
subscale scores in either extension study.
 xxxd2518xxx 

the long-term effectiveness and safety of  xxxd2518xxx  in adults with
schizophrenia has been evaluated in one unpublished 6-month,
open-label extension study [32] and one published 52-week
randomized, double-blind study [63] . in the 52-week study by
citrome et al., 639 patients with stable schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder were randomized to flexibly dosed  xxxd2518xxx 
(40–120 mg daily, mean 84.7 mg daily) or risperidone (2–6 mg
daily; mean: 4.3 mg daily) [63] . the primary objective was to evaluate the long-term safety and tolerability of  xxxd2518xxx ; however,
clinical efficacy was also assessed. all-cause discontinuation rates
were higher for  xxxd2518xxx -treated patients (269/419 [64%]) than
those who received risperidone (105/202 [52%], nnt 9 [95%
ci: 5–26]). median survival time to all-cause study medication
discontinuation was longer for the risperidone group (293 days)
than the  xxxd2518xxx  group (181 days), and the probability of allcause discontinuation at 12 months was 0.52 for risperidoneand 0.64 for  xxxd2518xxx -treated subjects (log-rank p = 0.018).
there were no significant between-group differences in the
occurrence of relapse ( xxxd2518xxx  [20%] vs risperidone [16%],
hr 1.31 [95% ci: 0.87–1.97]), defined a priori as an increase

from baseline in panss total score by >30% (with cgi-s >3),
rehospitalization for management of exacerbated psychotic symptoms, occurrence of suicidal (or homicidal) thinking, or increased
risk of harm to self or others as judged by the study clinician.
a preplanned test of noninferiority between treatment groups
could not be conducted owing to the small number of relapses.
panss total scores improved between baseline and 12 months in
both treatment groups ( xxxd2518xxx  -4.7 [95% ci -6.4 to -3.0] vs
risperidone -6.5 [95% ci: -8.8 to -4.3]), with no significant differences observed. there were no significant differences between
treatment groups in panss subscale, cgi-s or madrs scores
at study end point or during follow-up, with the exception of
greater improvement in madrs scores with  xxxd2518xxx  at month
12 (difference = 1.6, p = 0.007).
safety & tolerability
short-term safety & tolerability
 xxxd2330xxx 

the short-term safety profile of  xxxd2330xxx  was systematically
evaluated in a pooled analysis of three 6-week, randomized studies
in patients with schizophrenia [64] . included in the safety analysis
were patients who received at least one dose of study medication (n = 1912 total). the most common ­treatment-emergent
adverse effects for all  xxxd2330xxx  dosage groups (4–8, 10–16
and 20–24 mg/day) were dizziness (10–23%), dry mouth
(5–10%), somnolence (5–8%) and ­dyspepsia (5–8%). the occurrence of dizziness, somnolence and dry mouth was higher for
the 20–24 mg dose group than the lower dose groups [64,202] .
 xxxd2330xxx  was not shown to increase the risk of eps in any
of the three dosage groups or to increase prolactin levels in the
4–8-mg and 10–16-mg dosage groups (prolactin levels were not
measured in the study that included a 20–24-mg  xxxd2330xxx 
dose group) (table 7) [64] . worsening of akathisia occurred less
frequently in the  xxxd2330xxx  groups than with risperidone and
was similar to that observed in the placebo group. for prolactin
elevation, the pooled results contrast with those of the 4-week
pivotal study by cutler et al, in which elevated prolactin levels
were observed in 26% of  xxxd2330xxx -treated and 12% of placebotreated patients [35] .  xxxd2330xxx  was associated with moderate
increases in body weight (1.7–2.1 kg) over 6 weeks, similar to that
observed with risperidone (1.7 kg). clinically significant weight
gain, defined as an increase in body weight of >7% from baseline, was observed in 12.3% of  xxxd2330xxx -treated subjects during this time period (table 7) [64] . mild changes in blood glucose,
and only minimal changes in total cholesterol and triglyceride
values, were observed in all treatment groups (table 7) ; however,
increases in glucose values were statistically significant in all three
 xxxd2330xxx  dose groups and in the haloperidol group (table 7) .
rates of orthostatic hypotension were 19.5, 15.3 and 12%,
respectively, with  xxxd2330xxx  (all dosage groups combined),
haloperidol and risperidone [64] . in most cases, orthostatic
hypo­tension with  xxxd2330xxx  occurred within the first 7 days
of treatment and generally did not persist. there were statistically significant increases in the corrected qt (qtc) interval
from baseline were significant with all three  xxxd2330xxx  dosage

§
the paper by kane et al. [55] presents pooled results from three randomized, multi-center, prospective, flexible-dose, parallel-group studies of identical design. each study compared the clinical effects of flexibly
dosed ilo (n = 1239 randomized subjects, 4–16 mg/day) and hal (n = 405 randomized subjects, 5–20 mg/day) in patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder. a total of 1239 patients were randomized
to ilo and 405 to haloperidol during an initial 6-week, double-blind treatment phase. those who completed an initial 6-week double-blind treatment phase and achieved a positive treatment response (ilo,
n = 371 [36.6%]; hal, n = 118 [37.8%]) were included in a 46-week double-blind maintenance treatment phase.
¶
relapse was defined a priori as an increase in panss total scores of >25% or >10 points (compared with panss total scores taken at the end of the initial 6-week phase); or an increase in cgi-c scores by >2
points, hospitalization because of psychotic symptom exacerbation, or discontinuation of study medication due to lack of efficacy at any time after 6 weeks.
#
the relapse prevention study by kane et al. included 700 patients with clinically stable schizophrenia who were initially treated with open-label sublingual asp for up to 26 weeks. patients who were clinically stable
at the end of the open-label phase were randomized to double-blind continuation treatment with sublingual asp (n = 194) or placebo (n = 192) for 26 weeks.
††
relapse/impending relapse was defined a priori as occurrence of cgi-s score >4 on at least two days within a single week of follow-up, accompanied by any of the following: increase in panss total score
by >20% as compared with double-blind baseline score (taken at week 26); increase in panss total score by >10 points if the double-blind baseline score (at week 26) was <50; a score >5 on panss ‘hostility’ or
‘uncooperativeness’ items; a score >5 on any panss-positive symptom item (hallucinations, unusual thought content, or conceptual disorganization); or symptoms worsened in the opinion of the study clinician to
the point that concomitant rescue medications, addition or dosage increase of concomitant medications, or a level of care higher than outpatient was necessary.
‡‡
the study by schoemaker et al. [57] was a 52-week, randomized, multi-center, double-blind, flexible-dose comparison of asp and olz in 1219 adults (inpatient or outpatient) with schizophrenia or schizoaffective
disorder who had history of positive response to treatment with a nonclozapine antipsychotic drug. a double-dummy design was used to preserve the blind.
§§
the study by citrome et al. [63] was a 52-week, randomized, multicenter, double-blind, flexible-dose comparison of lur and ris in 629 adults with clinically stable schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder. the
primary objective of this study was to compare the long-term tolerability and safety of study drugs. efficacy variables were assessed secondarily.

this table does not present the design features or results of unpublished studies.
the paper by kane et al. [55] presents pooled results from three randomized, multi-center, prospective, flexible-dose, parallel-group studies of identical design. each study compared the clinical effects of flexibly
dosed ilo (n = 1239 randomized subjects, 4–16 mg/day) and hal (n = 405 randomized subjects, 5–20 mg/day) in patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder. a total of 1239 patients were randomized
to ilo and 405 to haloperidol during an initial 6-week, double-blind treatment phase. those who completed an initial 6-week double-blind treatment phase and achieved a positive treatment response (ilo,
n = 371 [36.6%]; hal, n = 118 [37.8%]) were included in a 46-week double-blind maintenance treatment phase.
¶
relapse was defined a priori as an increase in panss total scores of >25% or >10 points (compared with panss total scores taken at the end of the initial 6-week phase); or an increase in cgi-c scores by >2
points, hospitalization because of psychotic symptom exacerbation, or discontinuation of study medication due to lack of efficacy at any time after 6 weeks.
#
the relapse prevention study by kane et al. included 700 patients with clinically stable schizophrenia who were initially treated with open-label sublingual asp for up to 26 weeks. patients who were clinically stable
at the end of the open-label phase were randomized to double-blind continuation treatment with sublingual asp (n = 194) or placebo (n = 192) for 26 weeks.
††
relapse/impending relapse was defined a priori as occurrence of cgi-s score >4 on at least two days within a single week of follow-up, accompanied by any of the following: increase in panss total score
by >20% as compared with double-blind baseline score (taken at week 26); increase in panss total score by >10 points if the double-blind baseline score (at week 26) was <50; a score >5 on panss ‘hostility’ or
‘uncooperativeness’ items; a score >5 on any panss-positive symptom item (hallucinations, unusual thought content, or conceptual disorganization); or symptoms worsened in the opinion of the study clinician to
the point that concomitant rescue medications, addition or dosage increase of concomitant medications, or a level of care higher than outpatient was necessary.
‡‡
the study by schoemaker et al. [57] was a 52-week, randomized, multi-center, double-blind, flexible-dose comparison of asp and olz in 1219 adults (inpatient or outpatient) with schizophrenia or schizoaffective
disorder who had history of positive response to treatment with a nonclozapine antipsychotic drug. a double-dummy design was used to preserve the blind.
§§
the study by citrome et al. [63] was a 52-week, randomized, multicenter, double-blind, flexible-dose comparison of lur and ris in 629 adults with clinically stable schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder. the
primary objective of this study was to compare the long-term tolerability and safety of study drugs. efficacy variables were assessed secondarily.
¶¶
relapse was defined a priori as symptom worsening (increase of >30% in panss total score from baseline and cgi-s >3), hospitalization to manage psychotic symptom exacerbation, or emergence of suicidal or
homicidal ideation or behavior during follow-up.

asenapine

pooled safety data from three 6-week, fixed-dose trials and one
6-week flexible-dose trial of sublingual asenapine (5–10 mg b.i.d.)
for the treatment of adults with schizophrenia (asenapine, n = 572;
placebo, n = 378) indicated that the most common adverse effects
were insomnia (asenapine [15%]; placebo [13%]), somnolence
(asenapine [13%]; placebo [7%]), eps other than akathisia
(asenapine [10%], placebo [7%]) and akathisia (asenapine [6%];
placebo [3%]) [203] . transient oral hypoesthesias that typically
resolved within 1 h of study drug administration were reported in
5% of asenapine-treated subjects and 1% of subjects who received
placebo [203] . increases in body weight occurred in 5% of patients
randomized to asenapine, and <1% of individuals who received
placebo [203] . of all these effects, only the occurrence of akathisia
showed an apparent dose-related increase (asenapine 5 mg b.i.d.
[4%] vs asenapine 10 mg b.i.d. [11%]). minimal change in fasting glucose (asenapine [+3.2 mg/dl]; placebo [−1.6 mg/dl]),
total cholesterol (asenapine [+0.4 mg/dl]; placebo [−3.6 mg/dl]),
triglyceride (asenapine [+3.8 mg/dl]; placebo [−13.5 mg/dl])
and prolactin (asenapine [−6.5 ng/ml]; placebo [−10.7 ng/ml])
values were observed [203] . only minimal increases in qtc interval
(2–5 ms) occurred with asenapine at doses of 5–20 mg b.i.d., and
there were no significant differences in post-baseline qt increases
between asenapine (5–10 mg b.i.d.) and placebo [203] .
 xxxd2518xxx 

on the basis of pooled safety data from short-term, placebo­
controlled studies of  xxxd2518xxx  (20–160 mg) for treating adults
with schizophrenia ( xxxd2518xxx , n = 1,508; placebo, n = 709), the
most common adverse effects were somnolence ( xxxd2518xxx  [17%];
placebo [7%]), akathisia ( xxxd2518xxx  [13%]; placebo [3%]), nausea ( xxxd2518xxx  [10%]; placebo [5%]) and parkinsonism ( xxxd2518xxx  [10%]; placebo [5%]) [204] . minimal changes in body
weight were observed among  xxxd2518xxx -treated subjects (-0.15 to
+0.68 kg) and those who received placebo (-0.02 kg). significant
weight gain, defined as a >7% increase in body weight from baseline, was observed in 4.8% of  xxxd2518xxx -treated and 3.3% of
placebo-treated patients. the incidence of adverse events related
to eps (not including akathisia) was 13.5 and 5.8%, respectively,
among  xxxd2518xxx - and placebo-treated patients, while the overall
incidence of akathisia with  xxxd2518xxx  and placebo was 12.9 and
3.0%, respectively. the occurrence of akathisia increased with
 xxxd2518xxx  in a dose-dependent manner up to 120 mg/day (5.6%
at 20 mg; 10.7% at 40 mg; 12.3% at 80 mg; 22.0% at 120 mg).
the incidence of akathisia in the 160-mg group was 7.4%.
a recently published systematic review and meta-analysis by
de hert et al. compared the anthropometric and metabolic
effects of  xxxd2330xxx , asenapine,  xxxd2518xxx  and  xxxd2830xxx  in
short-term, randomized, placebo-controlled or head-to-head trials of patients with acute schizophrenia or bipolar disorder [65] .
analyzable data from longer-term studies were available only
76

for asenapine and  xxxd2830xxx . in the short-term studies, the
risk of clinically significant weight gain (defined as an increase
in body weight of > 7% from baseline) relative to placebo was
highest with asenapine (n = 5 trials [1360 randomized subjects]; pooled rr: 4.09 [95% ci: 2.25–7.43]; number needed
to harm [ xxxd669xxx ]: 17), followed by  xxxd2330xxx  (n = 4 trials [1931
randomized subjects]; pooled rrs 3.13 [95% ci: 2.08–4.70];
 xxxd669xxx : 11) and  xxxd2830xxx  (n = 12 trials [4087 randomized
subjects]; pooled rr: 2.17 [95% ci: 1.64–2.86];  xxxd669xxx : 20).
 xxxd2518xxx  was not associated with a statistically significant
change in body weight (n = 6 trials [1793 randomized subjects];
pooled rr: 1.42 [95% ci: 0.87–2.29]).  xxxd2330xxx  was associated with a statistically significant increase in total-cholesterol
(n = 1 trial [300 randomized subjects]; +11.6 mg/dl [95%
ci: 5.0–18.2]), hdl-cholesterol (n = 1 trial [300 randomized
subjects]; +3.6 mg/dl [95% ci: 1.6–5.6]), and ldl‑cholesterol
(n = 1 trial [300 randomized subjects]; +10.3 mg/dl [95%
ci: 4.9–15.7]), while  xxxd2518xxx  was associated with a statistically
significant increase in hdl‑cholesterol (n = 5 trials [1004 randomized subjects]; +1.5 mg/dl [95% ci: 0.6–2.4]). as reported
by the authors, no other clinically significant short-term changes
in glycemic or lipid indices were observed.
longer-term safety & tolerability
 xxxd2330xxx 

safety data were also included in the previously reviewed pooled
analysis of long-term randomized, double-blind  xxxd2330xxx  trials
[55] . the safety data set consisted of subjects who achieved a positive treatment response during an initial 6-week phase, received
at least one dose of double-blind study medication, and had at
least one safety evaluation during the long-term phase (n = 489).
insomnia (18.1%), anxiety (10.8%) and aggravation of schizophrenia symptoms (8.9%) were the most commonly observed
adverse effects associated with  xxxd2330xxx , and occurred at rates
similar to those observed with haloperidol. rates of study drug
discontinuation owing to intolerable adverse effects were 4.3 and
8.5%, for  xxxd2330xxx  and haloperidol, respectively.
at the end of the 6-week phase, mean extrapyramidal
symptoms rating scale (esrs) [66] scores decreased in the  xxxd2330xxx  group (-1.5) and increased in the haloperidol group (+0.3,
p < 0.0001). at the end of the long-term treatment phase, 48.2%
of patients who received  xxxd2330xxx  and 34.7% of those who
received halperidol indicated improvement in overall eps ratings. a significantly lower proportion of patients who received
 xxxd2330xxx  reported worsening of eps compared with those who
receive haloperidol (13.5 vs 36.4%; p < 0.001). worsening of
barnes akathisia scale [67] scores occurred in 9.2% of iloperidoneand 23.7% of haloperidol-treated subjects during the long-term
treatment phase (p < 0.001).
mean baseline to last observation change in body weight and
metabolic indices were also assessed [55] . modest changes in body
weight ( xxxd2330xxx  [+ 3.8 kg] vs haloperidol [+2.3 kg]; p = ns),
total cholesterol ( xxxd2330xxx  [+ 0.9 kg] vs haloperidol [+7.0 kg];
p = ns), triglycerides ( xxxd2330xxx  [+6.8 kg] vs haloperidol
[+12.1 kg]; p = ns) and glucose values ( xxxd2330xxx  [+5.8 kg]

vs haloperidol [-0.5 kg]; p = ns) were observed in both treatment groups. mean weight gain for subjects who completed all
52 weeks of follow up was 4.8 kg in the  xxxd2330xxx  group and
3.0 kg in the haloperidol group.
both  xxxd2330xxx  and haloperidol were associated with minor
changes in the qtcf interval at week 6 ( xxxd2330xxx  [+3.2 ms]
vs haloperidol [+4.0 msec]) and at study end point ( xxxd2330xxx 
[+10.3 ms] vs haloperidol [+9.4 msec]) [55] .
asenapine

in the long-term relapse-prevention study by kane et al., anxiety (8.2%), weight gain (6.7%) and insomnia (6.2%) were the
most frequently reported adverse effects observed in the asenapine
group [56] . the incidence of eps-related adverse events (3.1% vs
4.7%; p = ns) and mean changes in bars, sims and sas scores
were similar in the asenapine and placebo groups. mean changes
in weight during the 26-week double-blind treatment phase was
0.0 ± 3.4 kg with asenapine and −1.2 ± 4.0 kg with p­lacebo, while
the proportion of patients who experienced weight increases of
>7% from baseline was 3.7% with asenapine and 3.2% with placebo (p = ns). minimal changes from ­baseline in f­asting glucose
(asenapine [+2.09 mg/dl] vs placebo [+ 0.02 mg/dl]), glycosylated hemoglobin (asenapine [+0.05%] vs placebo [−0.06%]),
total cholesterol (asenapine [+0.9 mg/dl] vs placebo [−5.6 mg/
dl]) and triglyceride values (asenapine [+0.9 mg/dl] vs placebo
[−11.2 mg/dl]) were observed during the double-blind phase.
in the 52-week, double-blind comparison of asenapine and olanzapine by schoemaker et al., the most commonly reported adverse
events were weight gain (asenapine [12%] vs olanzapine [29%]),
sedation (asenapine [8%] vs olanzapine [10%]), somnolence
(asenapine [9%] vs olanzapine [10%]) and gastro­intestinal symptoms (asenapine [9%] vs olanzapine [7%]) [57] . mean increases in
body weight were greater in the olanzapine group than the asenapine group (+0.9 ± 4.8 kg vs +4.2 ± 7.6 kg) in the last observation
carried forward analysis, and in a secondary completer analysis. a
significant treatment × time interaction effect favoring asenapine
was observed for body weight beginning at week 1 and persisted
throughout the remainder of the study (p < 0.0001). the incidence
of weight gain >7% above baseline values was higher with olanzapine (57.1%) than with asenapine (22.0%). there were no significant changes from baseline, or between group differences, in total
cholesterol or glucose values. however, fasting triglyceride values
increased from baseline in the olanzapine group (+30.4 ± 202.6 mg/
dl) and decreased in the asenapine group (−9.8 ± 92.2 mg/dl).
predominantly mild eps-related symptoms were reported among
18% (14% akathisia) of asenapine- and 8% (4% akathisia) of
olanzapine-treated patients. only minimal changes in abnormal
involuntary movement scale, bars or sas scores were observed
during follow-up in both treatment groups. prolactin levels
decreased from baseline in both groups within the first two weeks
of follow-up and remained relatively stable during the remainder of
the study. electrocardiographic abnormalities (asenapine [2.4%],
olanzapine [1.3%]) were generally related to qtc prolongation;
however, no incident cases of qtc prolongation >500 ms were
observed. during the extension phase [58] , there were only minor

further changes in body weight, cholesterol or prolactin levels, and
incident eps-related adverse events in both groups.
the previously reviewed meta-analysis by de hert et al.
­summarized anthropometric and metabolic safety data from
longer-term studies (13 weeks in duration) of asenapine and  xxxd2830xxx  [65] . compared with placebo, asenapine was associated
with a significantly greater increase in body weight (n = 3 trials
[568 randomized subjects]; weighted mean difference +1.3 kg
[95% ci: 0.6–2.0]) and a higher rate of clinically significant
weight gain (n = 3 trials [568 randomized subjects]; pooled rr:
2.05 [95% ci: 1.21–3.46];  xxxd669xxx : 9).  xxxd2830xxx  was also associated with significantly greater increases in body weight (n = 6
trials [1174 randomized subjects]; weighted mean difference
+0.5 kg [95% ci: 0.2–0.8]) and a higher rate of clinically significant weight gain than placebo (n = 6 trials [1174 randomized
subjects]; pooled rr: 1.76 [95% ci: 1.06–2.90];  xxxd669xxx : 29).
 xxxd2518xxx 

longer-term safety and tolerability were assessed in the 52-week
study by citrome et al. that compared the clinical effects of
l­urasidone with risperidone [63] . the most commonly reported
adverse effects in both treatment groups were nausea ( xxxd2518xxx  [16.7%] vs risperidone [10.9%]; p < 0.05;  xxxd669xxx : 18; 95%
ci: 9–438), insomnia ( xxxd2518xxx  [15.8%] vs risperidone [13.4%];
p = ns), sedation ( xxxd2518xxx  [14.6%] vs risperidone [13.9%];
p = ns), akathisia ( xxxd2518xxx  [14.3%] vs risperidone [7.9%];
p < 0.05;  xxxd669xxx : 16; 95% ci: 9–73), somnolence ( xxxd2518xxx 
[13.6%] vs risperidone [17.8%]; p = ns), headache ( xxxd2518xxx 
[10.0%] vs risperidone [14.9%]; p = ns) and vomiting ( xxxd2518xxx  [10.0%] vs risperidone [3.5%], p < 0.05;  xxxd669xxx : 16; 95%
ci: 10–37). a significantly lower proportion of  xxxd2518xxx -treated
subjects reported treamtent-emergent weight gain ( xxxd2518xxx 
[9.3%] vs risperidone [19.8%]; p < 0.05;  xxxd669xxx : −10; 95% ci: -6
to -24). there were statistically significant between-group differences in body weight and bmi (p < 0.001 for each comparison);
however, changes from baseline in least‑square-mean (standard
error) body weight ( xxxd2518xxx  [-0.97 ± 5.06 kg] vs risperidone
[+1.47 ± 5.03 kg] and bmi ( xxxd2518xxx  [-0.33 ± 1.71 kg/m2] vs risperidone [+0.53 ± 1.76 kg/m2]) for each respective treatment group
were nonsignificant. a higher proportion of patients experienced
a >7% increase in body weight from baseline in the risperidone
group (14%) than the  xxxd2518xxx  group (7%;  xxxd669xxx : -16; 95% ci:
-9 to -104). baseline to end point changes in total cholesterol ( xxxd2518xxx  [-3.7 ± 29.5 mg/dl] vs risperidone [-4.3 ± 34.0 mg/dl]),
triglycerides ( xxxd2518xxx  [-8.4 ± 89.7 mg/dl] vs risperidone
[+8.5 ± 97.9 mg/dl]), glucose ( xxxd2518xxx  [+2.4 ± 26.1 mg/dl]
vs risperidone [+4.8 ± 20.4 mg/dl], p = 0.005), and glycosylated hemoglobin ( xxxd2518xxx  [+0.04 ± 0.34 %] vs risperidone
[+0.07 ± 0.32%]) were minimal or mild in each treatment group.
greater increases in prolactin concentration were observed among
risperidone-treated women ( xxxd2518xxx  [+5.16 ± 34.89 ng/ml] vs
risperidone [+33.90 ± 53.31 ng/ml], p < 0.001) and men ( xxxd2518xxx  [+2.51 ± 13.46 ng/ml] vs risperidone [+9.45 ± 14.13 ng/ml],
p < 0.001). no clinically s­ ignificant electrocardiographic changes
were observed in either treatment group.

expert commentary

schizophrenia is a severe, chronic, impairing and costly mental
disorder. in spite of remarkable advances in terms of pharmaco­
therapeutic options for treating the disorder, many unmet
therapeutic needs remain. positive signs and symptoms such as
hallucinations, delusions, and disorganized thinking and behavior, long considered the defining psychopathological features of
schizophrenia, have continued to be the symptom domain most
responsive to antipsychotic drug treatment. however, the clinical
significance of other psychopathological domains, such as negative (or deficit) signs and symptoms, depression and cognitive
impairment are now widely recognized. in particular, negative
signs and symptoms, and cognitive dysfunction may be more
directly related to the profound levels of functional incapacity
observed in many patients with schizophrenia than positive signs
and symptoms. thus far, available antipsychotic drugs, appear
to be far less effective for reducing primary negative signs and
symptoms and improving cognitive performance than they are
for treating positive signs and symptoms [68–70] . improvement in
cognition with atypical antipsychotic drugs is typically modest
in comparison with the total degree of impairment wrought by
the underlying disorder [71] .
many patients with schizophrenia and related psychotic disorders, such as schizoaffective disorder, still respond poorly to a
given antipsychotic agent in spite of adequate treatment adherence. for patients that do have a positive antipsychotic response,
many continue to experience residual, persisting symptoms that
are associated with poor clinical outcomes and low functioning. with the exception of clozapine for treatment-resistant
schizophrenia [14,15,72] , recent evidence suggests that, on the one
hand, there is considerable overlap in the effectiveness of most
anti­psychotics [73,74] . on the other hand, the interindividual
variability in therapeutic response to antipsychotic treatment
is considerable. to optimize pharmacotherapeutic benefit for
patients with schizophrenia, the wide array of anti­psychotic
drugs available to practitioners may be considered beneficial.
at the same time, this presents a formidable challenge – each
drug must be evaluated by clinicians, patients and caregivers on
their individual merits and limitations within, ideally, a shared
decision making framework [75] .
 xxxd2330xxx , asenapine and  xxxd2518xxx  are the newest agents
from a very large therapeutic class of atypical antipsychotic
drugs. in broad terms, they appear to share a lot in common.
first, like most other atypical antipsychotic drugs,  xxxd2330xxx 
and asenapine display more potent antagonist activity at 5-ht2a
receptors than d2 receptors, while  xxxd2518xxx  displays relatively
equivalent binding at both sites. second, all three are approved
for the treatment of acute schizophrenia in adults, while asenapine is additionally approved for maintenance treatment of schizophrenia, and manic or mixed episodes in adults with bipolar i
disorder (with or without psychotic features, as a single agent or
as a pharmacological adjunct or lithium or  xxxd3485xxx ). there
is currently no evidence of differential efficacy in acute- or maintenance-phase treatment of schizophrenia in adults for any of
these agents. finally, prior to the release of these medications and

 xxxd2830xxx , another relatively new atypical antipsychotic, there
were only two antipsychotic drugs (ziprasidone and aripiprazole)
that were classified widely as having low risk of clinically significant
treatment-emergent weight gain, glycemic dysregulation, hyperglycemia and atherogenic dyslipidemia. thus far,  xxxd2330xxx ,
asenapine, and  xxxd2518xxx  have been associated with only limited
changes in body weight, and nonclinically significant changes in
glycemic and lipid indices. available evidence therefore suggests
that these agents may eventually be classified as also having low
metabolic risk as additional data accumulates, and will be reasonable therapeutic options in patients for whom metabolic concerns
are treatment-limiting.
while  xxxd2330xxx , asenapine and  xxxd2518xxx  are similar in many
ways, there are some practical and theoretical differences between
these drugs based on their individual pharmacological properties
[76] , which may translate clinically to particular advantages and
disadvantages. these are summarized in table 8 and discussed in
greater detail below.
for example,  xxxd2330xxx  has been associated with strikingly low
rates of treatment-emergent akathisia in short-term trials [202] and
has the lowest rates of treatment-emergent akathisia of the three
newest antipsychotics, and lower rates of incident akathisia than
two other atypical antipsychotics, ziprasidone and risperidone,
in short-term trials [64] . even within the atypical class, the risk
of eps is not absent [77] . thus, limiting eps liability remains an
important therapeutic objective. this is especially true for patients
who are highly eps-sensitive (e.g., patients with first-episode psychosis, clinically significant parkinsonism, history of neuroleptic
malignant syndrome or a history of severe or difficult-to-control
akathisia or parkinsonism) or eps-intolerant (i.e., patients with
histories of poor adherence because of eps, regardless of severity).
clozapine and quetiapine have long been considered to have the
lowest eps risk among the available antipsychotics [78] ; however,
wider use of both agents may be limited by adverse metabolic risk
and potentially severe (even life-threatening) side-effects in the
case of clozapine. based on this,  xxxd2330xxx  may be preferred for
treating patients with who are highly eps-sensitive or -intolerant. these advantages may be offset, however, by a number of
factors, the first one being risk of orthostatic hypotension and
dizziness. although slow titration can reliably limit the incidence
of orthostatic hypotension, it can also limit the clinical utility of
 xxxd2330xxx  in acute settings, where limited lengths of stay often
make even brief delays in achieving therapeutic doses and adequate
symptom control unacceptable. given the need for titration to
limit side effects, it is not likely that oral  xxxd2330xxx  will be useful
for spot-management of agitation. an even slower titration may be
required for individuals who are particularly sensitive to dizziness
or orthostasis, including elderly patients, patients with heart disease, and persons taking antihypertensive drugs and other medications associated with orthostatic blood pressure changes. second,
although no cases of  xxxd2330xxx -associated torsades de pointes or
sudden death due to ventricular arrhythmias have been reported,
prolongation of the qtc interval has been observed across all
 xxxd2330xxx  doses. avoidance of  xxxd2330xxx  may be prudent for
patients who are medically susceptible to ventricular arrythmias

because of underlying heart disease, or for patients taking medically necessary concomitant medications that lengthen the qt
interval (e.g., anti-arrhythmics, or certain antibiotics, antihistamines, antidepressants, and so on), or who have other known
risk factors for ventricular arrhythmias [79] . these precautions
are similar to those for ziprasidone. when the balance between
clinical benefit and cardiac safety is uncertain, consultation with
a cardiologist may be warranted. fourth, monitoring for emergence of orthostatic blood pressure changes and qtc interval
prolongation may be especially important during a switch from
another antipsychotic to  xxxd2330xxx  and vice-versa, since some
other antipsychotics also carry significant risk of orthostasis and
qtc lengthening. this clearly applies when cross-tapering from
one drug to another (resulting in a short period of time when both
drugs are ingested), a reasonable switch method in ambulatory
settings given the slow titration required to achieve therapeutic
doses of  xxxd2330xxx . however, due caution would also apply when
abrupt switching is performed, since several days may be required
to clear most preswitch antipsychotics. finally, concomitant medications must be closely monitored – the dose of  xxxd2330xxx  needs
to be reduced in the presence of concomitant drugs that are strong
cyp450 2d6 and 3a4 inhibitors, and increased if these agents
are discontinued.
asenapine is the only antipsychotic drug available exclusively
in a rapidly dissolvable sublingual form, with reliable buccal
absorption. this can have a number of advantages – first, rapidly dissolvable formulations may be preferred by some patients
to swallowing solid oral tablets, including those with impaired
82

swallowing mechanisms or gastrointestinal malabsorption
problems. second, rapidly dissolving asenapine is more difficult to cheek than solid oral tablets, making adherence easier
to monitor, especially in inpatient or other controlled settings.
third, because it is rapidly absorbed and associated with mild
to moderate somnolence, oral asenapine may be appropriate for
spot-management of acute agitation and is being clinically investigated for this purpose (nct 01400113). of the three newest
antipsychotics, asenapine appears to have the lowest propensity
for elevating prolactin levels, although increases in prolactin
concentrations were modest with  xxxd2330xxx  and  xxxd2518xxx , and
clinically significant prolactin-related adverse effects occurred
only rarely. still, for patients in whom these effects could be
especially bothersome (including young people) or patients with
a history of treatment-emergent galactorrhea, menstrual changes,
gynecomastia or sexual dysfunction clearly correlated with elevations in prolactin concentration, asenapine may be an especially
attractive option. asenapine’s approval for treating acute mixed
or manic episodes in patients with bipolar i disorder may also
be considered an advantage, at least, for the time being, as most
other atypical antipsychotics were first approved for treating
acute schizo­phrenia, with subsequent approval for the treatment of acute bipolar manic or mixed episodes. finally, because
asenapine undergoes direct glucuronidation and is dependent
on the cyp450 system to a relatively limited degree, there may
also be low potential for clinically significant drug–drug interactions. for example, lack of cyp3a4 metabolism may make
asenapine the best choice of the three newest agents to combine

recently approved antipsychotic drugs for schizophrenia

with carbamazepine, where clinically indicated. there are some
potential disadvantages with asenapine. first, patients and caregivers must be carefully educated regarding the proper handling (with dry hands) and administration of asenapine. critical
details must include avoidance of swallowing the medication;
most patients with extensive prior treatment histories will be used
to swallowing their medication. allowing a tablet to dissolve
orally and avoiding food or drink to allow full absorption may
represent a considerable break from routine that can be surprisingly hard to accomplish for many patients. patients may also be
tempted to chew the tablets, which must also be avoided. second,
because of its negligible bioavailability if ingested, swallowing
asenapine can lead to covert or unintended problems with adherence, thus threatening clinical stability outside of supervised
settings. finally, some patients will experience dysgeusia or oral
hypoesthesia, which can occasionally prove bothersome enough
to threaten adherence. switching to the black cherry-flavored
formulation may be helpful in such cases. use of gum, candy,
breath mints, or related measures to overcome these effects must
be strictly avoided; at least, in the 10 min following asenapine
administration.
 xxxd2518xxx  has the lowest short-term risk of clinically significant weight increases and the most favorable glycemic and lipid
profile among the newest atypical antipsychotic drugs based on
indirect comparisons. that said, the overall metabolic profiles of
each of these new agents appears favorable in comparison with
several older atypical antipsychotics (excluding aripiprazole and
ziprasidone) and low-potency typical neuroleptics, and the metabolic profiles of each have not been directly compared. still, the
available data indicate that  xxxd2518xxx  will be considered a lowrisk agent in terms of metabolic adverse effect burden alongside
ziprasidone and aripiprazole. this would be advantageous for
any patient with schizophrenia, given the high long-term cardio­
vascular morbidity and early mortality associated with the disorder [6,80] . this may be especially true for patient subgroups
who are particularly vulnerable to the dysmetabolic effects of
antipsychotic drugs (i.e., young people, first-episode patients and
patients who have already begun to show substantial weight gain
or adverse changes in glycemic or lipid indices) [81–84] . for these
individuals, even small differences between agents in terms of
weight gain or metabolic profile can be clinically meaningful
and drive patient or caregiver preferences. pragmatic advantages
of  xxxd2518xxx  include once-daily dosing, which may improve
adherence, and the ability to initiate treatment at a clinically
effective dose, which may result in more rapid symptom control
during acute-phase treatment. on the other hand, there are some
potential disadvantages. first,  xxxd2518xxx  may be associated with
higher rates of akathisia than  xxxd2330xxx  or asenapine, although
direct comparisons are needed to confirm this observation. should
treatment-emergent akathisia become problematic, administering
 xxxd2518xxx  at bedtime may be helpful and even preferable, at least
initially, to dose reduction (which risks symptomatic worsening)
or pharmacological augmentation (which may increase overall
adverse effect burden). night time administration of  xxxd2518xxx 
to reduce daytime somnolence is practicable if evening meals can
www.expert-reviews.com

review

be timed accordingly and onset of akathisia does not adversely
impact sleep. second,  xxxd2518xxx , like ziprasidone, must be taken
with food (at least 350 kilocalories). otherwise, drug absorption
will likely be substantially reduced. while this will not present
a pragmatic challenge for most patients, the requirement that
 xxxd2518xxx  be taken in a fed state may be a limitation for low-functioning or very resource-poor patients with inconsistent access to
regular meals, hypocaloric diets or highly irregular mealtimes.
finally, of the three newest antipsychotics,  xxxd2518xxx  appears to
be associated with the highest rate of treatment-emergent somnolence, an often under-appreciated adverse effect that can profoundly impact daytime functioning and prove inconvenient or
embarrassing for patients. to reduce daytime somnolence, dosing
 xxxd2518xxx  at night may be helpful, provided that the medication can still be taken with (or in close proximity to) evening
meals and that akathisia, if present, does not interfere with sleep
initiation.
five-year view

 xxxd2330xxx , asenapine and  xxxd2518xxx  are the latest agents to
enter the very competitive atypical antipsychotic market. over
50 antipsychotic drugs are available worldwide, including
14 atypical agents, of which ten are now available in the usa.
the broad availability of such a large number of anti­psychotics
raises the question of what additional benefit these three new
antipsychotics may bring. on the one hand, the availability
of three new atypical anti­psychotics with low impact on body
weight and metabolic indices is highly desirable. indeed, most
recent antipsychotic drug development efforts have focused on
improving metabolic safety and overall tolerability, an important consideration given the high prevalence of cardiovascular
risk factors and premature mortality from cardiovascular causes
among persons with chronic and severe mental disorders who are
most likely to require long-term antipsychotic treatment [6,85] ,
and notoriously high rates of treatment nonadherence to which
poor anti­psychotic tolerability is a known contributor [86,87] .
concerns about long-term metabolic safety with some atypical
antipsychotics have already begun to influence recommendations in published clinical practice guidelines. owing to metabolic safety concerns, olanzapine is no longer recommended as a
first-line treatment for patients with first-episode schizophrenia
in the 2009 schizophrenia patient outcomes research team
(port) treatment recommendations [88] , or patients with bipolar disorder in the 2005 update of texas medication algorithm
project (tmap) guideline [89] . based in part on their advantageous metabolic profiles,  xxxd2330xxx , asenapine and  xxxd2518xxx 
will likely be considered first-line therapeutic options in future
practice guidelines for treating schizophrenia, particularly for
patients with first-episode psychosis.
on the other hand, clinicians, patients and caregivers will be
looking for specific advantages for each of these compounds in
addition to their favorable metabolic profiles and the bar will be
set very high in terms of distinguishing themselves among the
other atypical antipsychotic drugs. nearly all of the older atypical antipsychotics (with the exception of  xxxd2830xxx ) have been

around for more than 10 years; thus, each has an established place
within the therapeutic armamentarium based on years of clinical
experience and research efforts. although  xxxd2330xxx , asenapine,
and  xxxd2518xxx  are not new, they have been available to clinicians
for only a brief period of time. because practice experience is
so limited with these agents, direct head-to-head comparative
effectiveness studies are needed. currently, there is no evidence of
clinical superiority for  xxxd2330xxx , asenapine, or  xxxd2518xxx  over
other antipsychotics, and any potential tolerability advantages
discussed in this review would also need to be confirmed by direct
comparison trials.
although many acute-phase, placebo-controlled studies
reviewed herein also included an active control group consisting
of treatment with older and more established antipsychotics, they
were not sufficiently powered to provide valid comparisons, other
than with placebo. even if they were adequately powered, results
of short-term, registration-type clinical trials would generalize
poorly to real-world care [90] . long-term efficacy and safety data
are also limited, and consist chiefly of extension or responderenriched studies. until data from real-world comparative effect­
iveness studies of  xxxd2330xxx , asenapine and  xxxd2518xxx  become
available, clinical impressions will be based solely on indirect
comparisons with other antipsychotics.
of course, for such studies to be conducted with sufficient
validity to guide clinical practice, very large sample sizes and
long-term follow-up will be required. the expense and logistical
challenges involved make it unlikely that such data will be available any time soon. future research endeavors involving  xxxd2330xxx , asenapine and  xxxd2518xxx  will instead focus on broadening
the therapeutic range of these compounds. indeed, the number
of approved indications for several atypical antipsychotics has
expanded well beyond schizophrenia and acute manic/mixed
bipolar mood episodes to now include acute bipolar depression
(olanzapine combined with fluoxetine, and quetiapine) and
treatment-­resistant major depression (aripiprazole, olanzapine,
and quetiapine as adjuncts to antidepressants) [91–95] . several
large-scale research efforts in this regard are underway or have
been recently completed for asenapine,  xxxd2330xxx , and  xxxd2518xxx  (table 9) , particularly for treating mood disorders. asenapine
is already approved for treating manic or mixed bipolar mood
episodes; however, the efficacy of all reviewed agents for the treatment of major depression or the depressive phase of bipolar i disorder is being actively investigated. significantly greater reduction
in depressive symptoms with  xxxd2518xxx , as both a monotherapy
and an adjunct with lithium or  xxxd3485xxx , has been recently
demonstrated in two randomized, placebo-controlled, phase iii
studies, resulting in submission of two supplemental new drug
applications to the us fda [96,97] . given the limited number
of well-established options for managing the depressed phase of
bipolar disorder [98] , considerable therapeutic potential exists for
 xxxd2518xxx  to address a critical unmet need in managing patients
with bipolar disorder.
the clinical effects of  xxxd2330xxx , asenapine and  xxxd2518xxx 
are also being investigated in clinically important patient subgroups, including treatment-resistant patients, elderly patients
86

and youth (table 9) . the need is especially great for persons
with treatment‑resistant schizophrenia. up to 30% of patients
with schizophrenia are considered treatment resistant [99–101] .
clozapine continues to be the sole evidence-based pharmacotherapy for treatment-resistant illness [102] ; thus, no credible
evidence-supported alternatives to clozapine exist. broader
use of clozapine is limited, even for patients who require such
treatment, by well-characterized but severe adverse effects,
including dose-dependent seizure risk, idio­syncratic risk of
bone marrow suppression and agranulocytosis, cardiac effects
(cardio­myopathy, myocarditis), clinically significant weight gain,
hyperglycemia and new-onset type 2 diabetes, and atherogenic
hyperlipidoses [103] . the efficacy of  xxxd2518xxx  (at higher than
usual doses – up to 240 mg/day) for treatment-resistant schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder is being investigated (table 9)
and similar research efforts may be pursued in the future for
 xxxd2330xxx  and asenapine.
the development of reliable biological predictors of clinical
benefit and adverse effects under antipsychotic treatment will be
an additional research focus. currently, no genetic or biological
response predictors are yet sufficiently valid for routine clinical
use. whole-genome association studies have been conducted
using data from the randomized, double-blind, placebo- and
ziprasidone-controlled phase iii study by cutler et al. to identify
genetic predictors of efficacy response and risk markers for qt
interval prolongation [35,104,105] . these analyses uncovered several
dna polymorphisms that were significantly associated with clinical response and qt prolongation in  xxxd2330xxx -treated patients
[104–106] . while these results are promising, further study is needed
and routine genetic testing of patients who require antipsychotic
treatment is not likely to become adopted outside of the clinical
research setting in the immediate future.
finally, development of new formulations for expanded
clinical use will be also be given high priority. an injectable
depot formulation of  xxxd2330xxx  has already been developed
and is in phase ii testing (nct 1348100). if further developed, depot  xxxd2330xxx  would be only the second long-acting
injectable atypical antipsychotic (other than  xxxd2830xxx  palmitate) formulated for administration every 4 weeks. however,
a long-acting injectable form of aripiprazole, also formulated for
administration once monthly, is nearing the end of phase iii
testing (nct 00705783, 01432444) and may be available for
clinical use relatively soon.
in conclusion,  xxxd2330xxx , asenapine and  xxxd2518xxx  are the
newest agents from a long line of atypical antipsychotic drugs.
while none of these agents appear to be more clinically effective
than other antipsychotics for treating adults with schizophrenia,
they may have advantages over some available antipsychotics in
terms of metabolic safety. comparative effectiveness studies with
older and more established antipsychotics are lacking, and longterm pragmatic trials are needed in order to assess the effectiveness
of the newer agents in patients under usual-care conditions. until
such data are available, the exact place of  xxxd2330xxx , asenapine
or  xxxd2518xxx  within a broader clinical context will be based on
indirect comparisons of available outcome data, and consideration

of pharmacological differences between agents that may confer
putative advantages and disadvantages for each drug. wider testing of these newer agents will be needed to determine the extent to
which these differences are clinically meaningful, and to explore
the therapeutic potential of each for indications outside of schizophrenia (and acute manic or mixed bipolar mood episodes in the
case of asenapine) and in clinically important patient populations
that were not included in phase iii testing. ultimately, newer
agents with novel mechanisms are likely to be required [107] .

key issues
•  xxxd2330xxx , asenapine and  xxxd2518xxx  are the newest agents from a very large therapeutic class of atypical antipsychotic drugs. like
most other atypical antipsychotic drugs, each binds with high potency to 5-ht2a and d2 receptors; however, they display variable
affinity for other neuroreceptors.
• regulatory approval for the acute-phase treatment of adults with schizophrenia has been established for each agent on the basis
of multiple short-term, placebo-controlled, registration-type studies. data from longer-term studies are more limited. thus far, only
asenapine has regulatory approval in the usa for maintenance treatment of schizophrenia and acute treatment of manic/mixed
episodes in adults with bipolar i disorder.
• to date, all agents appear to be well tolerated and there is no evidence of superior clinical effectiveness for one agent over other
available antipsychotic drugs, although adverse effect profiles vary. on the basis of available data,  xxxd2330xxx  appears to have
the lowest extrapyramidal symptoms liability, although relatively higher risk of orthostasis and dizziness require slow titration to
therapeutic doses, and monitoring of qt intervals may be required for some patients. asenapine has only a minimal effect on prolactin
concentration, while  xxxd2518xxx  appears to have the lowest impact on body weight and metabolic indices; however, dose-related
extrapyramidal symptoms and somnolence with both may be limiting for some patients.
• comparative effectiveness studies conducted over the long term and in broader, representative patient samples are needed to guide
clinicians when choosing among the available antipsychotic agents. until then, individual medications must be evaluated on the basis
of their individual merits and liabilities, including adverse effect and safety profile, ease of use, patient acceptability and potential for
drug–drug interactions.
