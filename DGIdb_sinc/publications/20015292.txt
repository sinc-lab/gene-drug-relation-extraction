the receptor activity-modifying proteins (ramps) are a family of three single transmembrane proteins that have been identified
as accessory proteins to some g-protein-coupled receptors (gpcrs). they can regulate their pharmacology, forward trafficking
and recycling, depending on the gpcr. the best characterized receptor complexes formed by ramps and gpcrs are the
calcitonin peptide family receptors. the association of  xxxg1926xxx  with the  xxxg321xxx -like receptor (cl) constitutes
the calcitonin gene-related peptide receptor, whereas  xxxg1927xxx  or 3 with cl generates  xxxg80xxx  receptors. in this case,
the ramps substantially alter the pharmacology and trafficking properties of this gpcr. amylin receptor subtypes are formed
from  xxxg321xxx  (ctr) interactions with ramps. although the ramps themselves are not responsive to calcitonin
peptide family ligands, there is clear evidence that they participate in ligand binding, although it is still unclear whether this
is by directly participating in binding or through allosteric modulation of cl or ctr. a considerable amount of mutagenesis
data have now been generated on ramps to try and identify the residues that play a role in ligand interactions, and to also
identify which residues in ramps interact with cl and ctr. this review will focus on ramp mutagenesis studies with cl,
summarizing and discussing the available data in association with current ramp models and structures. the data reveal key
regions in ramps that are important for ligand binding and receptor interactions.

introduction

of processes including bone formation, nutrient intake,
vasodilation, cardioprotection, pain perception, neurogenic
inflammation, angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis. thus,
the family is of considerable clinical potential, and the receptors for these peptides are important drug targets.
the receptors for these peptides belong to family b
(secretin-like) g-protein-coupled receptors (gpcrs), namely
the  xxxg321xxx  (ctr) and  xxxg321xxx -like
receptor (cl). however, for most members of the calcitonin
peptide family, the presence of another protein is required to
form a functional receptor with cl or ctr at the cell surface.
this protein is known as a receptor activity-modifying protein

the calcitonin family of peptides includes calcitonin, calcitonin gene-related peptide (cgrp),  xxxg80xxx  (am), am2
(also known as intermedin) and amylin (amy). genetic
models, combined with traditional pharmacological techniques, have revealed roles for these peptides in a wide range

(ramp). in 1998, mclatchie and colleagues isolated a single
cdna that encoded a 148-amino-acid protein during
attempts to expression-clone the gene encoding the human
cgrp receptor from cells derived from a human neuroblastoma (sk-n-mc cells) (mclatchie et al., 1998). xenopus
oocytes expressing this protein gave rise to a large
concentration-dependent response to cgrp, compared with
the endogenous response. this protein was named  xxxg1926xxx ,
which together with cl reconstituted a functional cgrp
receptor (mclatchie et al., 1998). co-expression of these two
components is obligatory for the full functionality of a cgrp
receptor, as neither of them induce a significant response to
cgrp when transfected alone (mclatchie et al., 1998). besides
human  xxxg1926xxx , another two proteins belonging to the ramp
family were also cloned, which were named as  xxxg1927xxx 
(cloned from sk-n-mc cells) and  xxxg1928xxx  (cloned from
human spleen) (mclatchie et al., 1998). cl expressed with
 xxxg1927xxx  or 3 generates receptors for am (am1 and am2, respectively), a relative of cgrp. thus, the interaction between
ramps and receptors confers ligand specificity. among the
calcitonin family peptides, calcitonin is the only known
ligand that does not require ramp to bind to its receptor.
co-expression of a ramp molecule with ctr, however, generates amy receptors. note that the abbreviation amy
denotes the peptide, but amy denotes the receptor for this
peptide. the pharmacology of these receptors has been investigated in different cell types, which has been extensively
reviewed (sexton et al., 2001; poyner et al., 2002; kuwasako
et al., 2004; hay et al., 2006b). table 1 summarizes the
molecular composition of the calcitonin peptide family receptors and their pharmacological profiles.
interestingly, the modulating role of ramps is not limited
to calcitonin family peptide-binding events. the fact that
ramps are more widely distributed across cell and tissue types
than ctr or cl suggests additional roles for ramps
(mclatchie et al., 1998). there is now evidence that at least
four other receptors couple with ramps. they are the vpac1
receptor (vasoactive intestinal polypeptide/pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating peptide, with all three ramps), pth-1
receptor ( xxxg1885xxx , with  xxxg1927xxx ) and pth-2
receptor (with  xxxg1928xxx ) (christopoulos et al., 2003). in addition,  xxxg1926xxx  and  xxxg1928xxx  have also been reported to complex
with a family c gpcr, the  xxxg343xxx . this
association is required for receptor trafficking (bouschet et al.,
2005). indeed, being ubiquitously expressed in many cells, it
will not be surprising to identify ramps coupling with not
only more gpcrs, but also other proteins. for example, an

table 1

interaction between  xxxg1926xxx  and b-tubulin has been reported,
suggesting broader biological roles for ramps than as gpcr
accessory proteins (kunz et al., 2007).
all three human ramps share a common structure: a short
intracellular c-terminus (~9 amino acids), a single transmembrane (tm) domain (~22 amino acids) and a long extracellular
n-terminus (~91 amino acids for  xxxg1926xxx  and  xxxg1928xxx , ~102
amino acids for human  xxxg1927xxx ). in addition, there is a predicted signal sequence of ~26 to ~44 amino acids at the
n-terminus. while the n-terminus is the major determinant
of receptor pharmacology (fraser et al., 1999; zumpe et al.,
2000), the tm and c-terminus have been suggested to be
important in ramp–receptor interactions (zumpe et al., 2000;
udawela et al., 2006b) and intracellular signalling for amy
receptors (udawela et al., 2006a; morfis et al., 2008) respectively. furthermore, the c-terminus of ramp also possesses
some specific functional features including an endoplasmic
reticulum retention signal in human  xxxg1926xxx  and type-1 pdz1
recognition sequence in human  xxxg1928xxx , which directs
cl/ xxxg1928xxx  complexes to recycling (kuwasako et al., 2000;
hilairet et al., 2001a; steiner et al., 2002; bomberger et al.,
2005). studies on the tm region and c-terminus of ramps
have been reviewed elsewhere (hay et al., 2006b; parameswaran and spielman, 2006; sexton et al., 2009). this review will
therefore focus on the n-terminus of ramps.
early experimental evidence indicated that the n-terminus
of ramps contributes to the peptide-binding pocket together
with the n-terminus of cl, as cross-linking using 125i-am and
125
i-cgrp showed that the ramps located close to the
peptide-binding pocket in the cl/ramp complexes (hilairet
et al., 2001b). however, it is still an open question as to
whether ramps modulate receptor pharmacology either by
directly providing points of contact or allosterically altering
the receptor structure to allow selective ligand binding. therefore, any effect observed in mutagenesis studies for ramps is
likely to reflect an impact on the overall receptor complex.
therefore, functional data for ramp mutants should not be
considered in isolation, but as part of a receptor complex.
so far, the molecular analysis of ramps has mostly been
limited to their ability to form cgrp and am receptors. there
is also some information on how amy receptors are affected
by residue substitutions, but the amount of information available is too sparse to draw any meaningful conclusions. in the
interests of brevity, only cgrp and am receptors (i.e.
cl/ramp complexes) will therefore be discussed in this
review. a pattern is emerging of key regions involved in conferring pharmacological specificity and receptor interactions.

the structure of ramps
the primary amino acid sequences of the three human
ramps reveal about 31% identity and about 56% similarity to
each other (figure 1). across species, the tm regions show
high conservation, while n-termini are less conserved. this
high degree of variability in the n-terminus suggests that this
region is most likely to contribute to the pharmacological
specificity that these proteins engender. however, within each
ramp, the sequence homology in the n-terminus is considerably greater across species. despite low n-terminal sequence
homology, all ramps across species contain four conserved
cysteine residues, which presumably form disulphide bonds,
suggesting a common secondary structure.
before any ramp structure was available, attempts were
made to predict the structural characteristics of ramps. the
first human  xxxg1926xxx  structure was modelled using an ab
initio method, where an ab initio modelling protocol was
developed for the structural prediction of ramp family proteins (simms et al., 2006). the secondary structure was
obtained by a consensus from two prediction routines.
these were selected based on their ability to predict the secondary structure of 16 diverse, small, helical, disulphide
bond-containing peptides of known structure. the structure
predicted from this ab initio model suggested that the
human  xxxg1926xxx  n-terminus comprised three a-helices
(a-helix 1, a-helix 2 and a-helix 3), and that residues 118–
139 form a small tm domain. the disulphide bonding
pattern predicted by this model was tested using sitedirected mutagenesis at cysteine residues where the arrangement of disulphide bonds was determined using double
mutants of every cysteine pair (simms et al., 2006).
another ramp structural model was later built by benítezpáez from a primary sequence alignment of 38 ramps (1–3)
across different species that were retrieved from a psi blast
search with a human  xxxg1926xxx  sequence lacking the signal
peptide (benítez-páez, 2006). the model predicted in this
study had a similar organization as the ab initio model generated by simms and colleagues, but with some differences
including the disulphide bonding pattern and the orientation
of a-helix 3. the author later published a follow-up study
where phylogenetic and statistical analyses were carried out
on the ramps across different species (benítez-páez and

1061

cárdenas-brito, 2008). the study suggested a collection of
residues that could potentially be functionally important,
many of which were found in the extracellular domains of
ramps. the tm helix of  xxxg1928xxx  was also modelled in this
study. interestingly, some of the residues that were predicted
to be important for receptor function from their analyses are
localized on the tm helix (benítez-páez and cárdenas-brito,
2008).
the tri-helical organization stabilized by three disulphide
bonds for the human  xxxg1926xxx  n-terminus [residues 27–107
(ramp127–107)] was confirmed by a crystal structure (kusano
et al., 2008) (figures 1 and 2a). this indicates that a-helix 1 is
formed by residues e29 to v51, and is kinked at residue l39.
it is followed by a small helical structure consisting of e53 to
l55, which sits within the loop connecting a-helices 1 and 2.
a-helix 2 is anti-parallel to the other two helices, starting at
w59 and ending at l80, whereas a-helix 3 is formed by
residues from a87 to y100. the interacting residues forming
the three disulphide bonds predicted by simms et al. were
confirmed in the crystal structure as  xxxd962xxx –c82, c40–c72 and
c57–c104. the structure is maintained by multiple hydrophobic interaction sites, which mostly locate between
a-helices 1 and 2.
based on the electrostatic potential distribution on the
solvent accessible surface of the crystal structure of the
human  xxxg1926xxx  n-terminus, a hydrophobic patch located on
a-helices 2 and 3 was identified (kusano et al., 2008). residues that are likely to constitute the receptor (cl) and
ligand (cgrp) binding interfaces were proposed from this
area. f93, h97 and f101 were proposed to form the cl
binding interface, whereas residues r67,  xxxd71xxx , w74, e78 and
w84 were predicted to constitute part of the ligand (cgrp)
binding pocket. the residues which are thought to form the
cl binding interface as identified in the crystal structure are
highly conserved across ramps, supporting the notion that
these residues have an important role in ramp function.
the contribution of some of these residues to either receptor
or ligand interaction has been tested experimentally; these
studies are discussed below. nevertheless, further experimental evidence is needed to confirm these assignations.
despite the low sequence identities between three ramps,
they are believed to adopt a similar fold. this prediction is
supported in the sequence comparison that shows that the

sequence.

residues that have been characterized for either cgrp responses at the cgrp receptor (a) or am responses at the  xxxg1928xxx  (b). green,
peptide potency was not affected; red, peptide potency was reduced by <100-fold; purple, peptide potency was reduced by >100-fold; yellow,
peptide potency was enhanced by <100-fold. in addition, residues shown in stick form indicate that the point mutations also reduced cell
surface expression of the receptor complex. pale blue (a) or dark blue (b) represents the residues that have not been characterized by point
mutation in  xxxg1926xxx  and  xxxg1928xxx  respectively.

two disulphide bonds, which have a more important role in
stabilizing the  xxxg1926xxx  structure (c40–c72 and c57–c104),
are conserved across three ramps. further, the equivalent
sites in ramps 2 and 3 to the intramolecular interaction sites
identified in the crystal structure of  xxxg1926xxx  extracellular
domain are also mostly hydrophobic (kusano et al., 2008). a
homology model for hramp328–107 has been produced based
on the  xxxg1926xxx  crystal structure (r.j. bailey et al., unpublished)
(figure 2b). this model provides an indication of how the
structures of  xxxg1926xxx  and  xxxg1928xxx  compare, but a crystal structure of  xxxg1928xxx  is needed to confirm similarities and differences between these proteins.
beyond the valuable insight provided by the  xxxg1926xxx  crystal
structure, as mentioned earlier, the n-terminus of the ramp
has been shown experimentally to be the major determinant
of receptor pharmacology, in conjunction with cl or ctr
(fraser et al., 1999; zumpe et al., 2000; hilairet et al., 2001b;
udawela et al., 2006b). it is thought that the ramp and receptor work together to form the appropriate binding site for the
british journal of pharmacology (2010) 159 1059–1068

individual ligands (sexton et al., 2009). several studies have
been carried out on this region, aiming to elucidate the residues that are important for receptor function and expression.
in the following sections, mutagenesis data available from the
literature for ramps are summarized and discussed in conjunction with the newly available structural information (for
ramps 1 and 3).

 xxxg1926xxx  n-terminus
among the three ramps,  xxxg1926xxx  is the best understood
member, mainly with cl, as the cgrp receptor. the importance of the  xxxg1926xxx  n-terminus in conferring receptor pharmacology was first demonstrated in a study employing
 xxxg1926xxx / xxxg1927xxx  chimeras (fraser et al., 1999). the respective
roles of individual residues or regions within the  xxxg1926xxx 
n-terminus are inferred from subsequent studies employing
individual amino acid substitutions, deletion mutants and

receptor activity-modifying proteins
t qi and dl hay

chimeras between  xxxg1926xxx  and  xxxg1927xxx . overall, the mutations
that induced a change in either cgrp receptor function or
expression generally locate in a-helices 2 and 3 of the  xxxg1926xxx 
n-terminus, which suggests that a-helices 2 and 3 are the
major determinants of cl and cgrp interactions (e.g. y66,
l69, t73, h97; see below).

helix 1 and loop 1 (joining helices 1 and 2)
there have been attempts to identify important regions
within helix 1 and loop 1 using deletion or chimera mutants.
several such mutants (deletions 28–33, 34–39, 41–45, 46–50,
51–55 and  xxxg1926xxx /2 chimera 27–50) generally resulted in
reduced peptide (ham and hacgrp) responses, which were
mostly paralleled by some degree of loss in receptor expression at the cell surface (kuwasako et al., 2001; 2003a). sitedirected mutagenesis has been, in addition, employed to
study the role of individual residues in  xxxg1926xxx  to cgrp receptor function in these regions. these mutants and their effects
are summarized in table 2 and figure 2a. apart from the
mutations introduced at two (c40 and c57) of the three
cysteine residues ( xxxd962xxx , c40 and c57), which showed a
reduced cgrp potency and reductions in cell surface expression, the rest of the point mutations introduced in these
regions elicited little effect in either cgrp response or cell
surface expression. the data together indicate that a-helix 1
of  xxxg1926xxx  may have only a minor role in directly contributing
to cl and cgrp interactions.

helix 2 and loop 2 (joining helices 2 and 3)
several small deletion mutants covering regions 59–65,
67–71, 74–76, 78–80 and 83–86 in a-helix 2 and loop 2 have
been characterized for their effects on cgrp and am
responses (kuwasako et al., 2001; 2003a). although the data
generated from these mutants are difficult to interpret as the
change in pharmacology may have partially been a result of
loss in cell surface expression, it has been suggested that
residues 78–80 may specifically contribute to am pharmacology as the cgrp receptor containing the deletion had a
greater loss in am than cgrp responses (kuwasako et al.,
2003a). regions 78–80 reside at the end of a-helix 2, and
residues within this region lie either on or close to the ligandbinding pocket proposed from the crystal structure of the
 xxxg1926xxx  n-terminus. thus, the differential effects observed
with this deletion mutant on am and cgrp responses may
suggest different contributions of these residues to the am
and cgrp binding pockets, either in a direct or indirect
manner.
point mutants generated in a-helix 2 and loop 2 have
provided some experimental support for the residues that
may be important for receptor/ligand interactions (table 2
and figure 2a). w74 is the only residue that has been studied
among the residues proposed to be important for cgrp interactions by the crystal structure. although w74 has been demonstrated to be important for the high affinity and selectivity
of the antagonist bibn4096bs for the human cgrp receptor,
it did not affect cgrp potency when mutated to alanine,

1063

lysine or  xxxd2431xxx  (mallee et al., 2002; hay et al., 2006a;
qi et al., 2008). these data suggest that w74 may be in the
vicinity of cgrp binding residues, but that it is not directly
involved in binding cgrp.
some neighbouring residues of the proposed cgrp binding
interface showed the importance of this region to cgrp
receptor function. mutant y66a almost completely abolished
cl trafficking, suggesting that considerable structural perturbation was introduced by the mutation and that y66 may also
directly contribute to the cl binding interface (simms et al.,
2009). in contrast, l69a and t73a reduced cgrp potency
without affecting the cell surface expression, indicating that
they may contribute to cgrp interactions, most likely in an
indirect manner given their position (not solvent exposed) in
the crystal structure.

helix 3 and region joining helix 3 and tm domain
a study employing deletion mutants generated within a-helix
3 and region joining helix 3 and tm domain (88–90, 91–94,
96–100, 101–103, 105–107, 109–112 and 113–118) has suggested that 91–103 might be important for conferring highaffinity cgrp binding, whereas residues 88–90 may
specifically contribute to am pharmacology (kuwasako et al.,
2003a). interestingly, when locating these residues in the
crystal structure, residues 91–103 overlie the proposed cl
interaction site. this indicates that the change in pharmacology observed was more likely to be related to the loss in the
cell surface expression (as reported in the original study),
resulting from disruption of the cl binding interface. regions
88–90 reside at the beginning of a-helix 3, opposite but still in
close proximity to the proposed ligand-binding pocket by the
crystal structure. thus, the region may contribute to the
am-binding pocket in either a direct or indirect manner.
numerous point mutations that cover most of the residues
in a-helix 3 and region joining helix 3 and tm domain have
been characterized (table 2 and figure 2a). these data
provide experimental support for some of the residues that
have been suggested to be important for cl or cgrp interactions from the  xxxg1926xxx  crystal structure. f93a  xxxg1926xxx /cl in
one study showed significantly reduced cell surface expression, but the cgrp response was not changed (simms et al.,
2009). in another study, reduced total cgrp binding was
further observed at f93a  xxxg1926xxx /cl (kuwasako et al., 2003a).
on the other hand, f93i led to reduced cgrp potency in the
absence of any change in cell surface expression (qi et al.,
2008). it, therefore, seems unlikely that f93 is directly
involved in constituting a cl binding interface as suggested
by kusano et al. (2008). h97, which was also predicted to
locate at the cl binding interface by the crystal structure,
caused a significant reduction in both cell surface expression
and cgrp-evoked camp production when mutated to
alanine (simms et al., 2009). in another study, h97a led to a
significantly reduced total cgrp binding, and small reductions in cgrp potency and cell surface expression (kuwasako
et al., 2003a). these observations are broadly consistent with
each other, generally supporting the importance of h97 in cl
association. another residue at the proposed cl binding
interface, f101, showed an interesting response when

mutated to alanine. cell surface expression and cgrp
binding were significantly reduced, accompanied by a
reduced maximum response of cgrp-evoked camp production; however, cgrp potency was not affected (kuwasako
et al., 2003a; simms et al., 2009). it is likely that f101a
reduced the ability of  xxxg1926xxx  to associate with cl, which
supports the involvement of f101 in constituting the cl
binding interface; however, the receptor function seemed to
be retained or even enhanced at f101a mutant receptors.
in general, the residues identified on the crystal structure
which have been tested thus far are clearly of importance for
either cl interaction or ligand binding. further experimental
data are needed to define the exact residues that are involved
in specific high-affinity ligand binding.

 xxxg1927xxx  n-terminus
the structure–function relationships in the  xxxg1927xxx 
n-terminus are less well defined. consistent with  xxxg1926xxx ,
large chimeras involving exchanging the entire n-terminus of
between ramps 1 and 2 suggest that the receptor pharmacology is mainly determined by the n-terminus of  xxxg1927xxx  (fraser
et al., 1999). data generated from some smaller  xxxg1926xxx /2
chimeras have narrowed down the pharmacologydetermining region to 77–101 (kuwasako et al., 2001). some
deletion mutants within this region were also studied (deletions 66–69, 70–75, 76–78, 79–82, 83–85, 86–89, 86–92,
90–92, 93–96, 97–99 and 100–103); however, changes
observed with the functional data were mostly paralleled by
the poor cell surface expression of the mutant am1 receptors
(kuwasako et al., 2001). this suggests that these mutations
may have introduced gross alterations in the overall receptor
structure. nevertheless, the authors speculated that regions
86–92 were critical for peptide binding (kuwasako et al.,
2001). an alanine scan was additionally performed at residues
86–92, but none of the individual mutations caused a change
in the am-evoked response (table 3). in addition, the equivalent regions in rat  xxxg1927xxx  (93–99) have been demonstrated to

be important for am affinity and potency in the rat am1
receptor (kuwasako et al., 2002). deletion of this region had a
significant impact on both am binding and potency when
co-expressed with cl.
site-directed mutagenesis has also been carried out to investigate the role of individual residues in  xxxg1927xxx  to am1 receptor function. the importance of the extracellular cysteine
residues has been demonstrated by alanine substitution. the
four mutant receptors containing c68a, c84a, c99a and
c131a  xxxg1927xxx  all failed to be transported and expressed at
the cell surface, and thus failed to respond to am (kuwasako
et al., 2003b). this is likely to be due to destabilization of the
 xxxg1927xxx  structure. besides cysteines, the extracellular histidine
residues have also been studied for their involvement in am
binding (kuwasako et al., 2008). h124a and h127a seemed to
alter the overall protein structure that led to poor cell surface
expression, and failure to bind or respond to am. h124,
which is conserved among the ramp family (h97 in ramps 1
and 3), is suggested to be directly involved in forming the
interaction site with cl, as h97 in  xxxg1926xxx  is identified as one
of the three residues that constitute the cl binding interface
(kusano et al., 2008). h127 is also likely to contribute to the
cl binding interface, as it resides in close proximity to h124;
the mutation at this position may have altered and thus
disrupted the interface. on the other hand, h102a had little
effect on the receptor expression and function. h71a displayed reduced am binding and potency in the absence of a
change in the cell surface expression. it is therefore possible
that h71 in  xxxg1927xxx  may be involved in am binding, either
directly or indirectly.
unlike  xxxg1926xxx , the interpretation of the mutagenesis data
generated at  xxxg1927xxx  residues is constrained at the present
time by the lack of structural information for  xxxg1927xxx .

 xxxg1928xxx  n-terminus

been examined in mouse  xxxg1928xxx . when mouse  xxxg1928xxx  was
co-transfected with cl individual mutations of each cysteine
to serine mostly led to reduced cell surface expression
(flahaut et al., 2003), suggesting that some structural perturbation may have been introduced to the receptor complex by
the mutations. however, the effects of mutations at cysteine
residues in  xxxg1928xxx  do not seem as large as those observed in
human ramps 1 and 2 (kuwasako et al., 2003b; simms et al.,
2006). data generated by site-directed mutagenesis at other
positions in human  xxxg1928xxx  are summarized in table 4 and
figure 2b.

predicted helix 1
mutagenesis has only been performed on two residues (e35
and d46) in predicted a-helix 1 of  xxxg1928xxx . the mutations at
these two positions induced no significant change in either
cgrp or am response. there was a small, but significant,
reduction in the cell surface expression for mutant d46v,
while mutant receptor containing e35a retained its expression level at the cell surface.

predicted helix 2
the equivalent residues to 86–92 in human  xxxg1927xxx  were also
investigated in human  xxxg1928xxx  (59–65) (kuwasako et al.,
2001). deletion of residues 59–65 of human  xxxg1928xxx  reduced
am potency and diminished specific am binding when
co-expressed with cl. however, whether this effect seen was
due to altered cell surface expression was unclear. the equivalent regions in rat  xxxg1928xxx  (58–64) have also been characterized (kuwasako et al., 2002). deletion of these seven residues
british journal of pharmacology (2010) 159 1059–1068

led to a significant reduction in both am binding and potency
at  xxxg1928xxx , but cell surface expression was not affected.
site-directed mutagenesis has also been conducted to determine the role of individual residues (figure 2b, table 4). position 74 stands out from these studies. as mentioned earlier,
w74 in  xxxg1926xxx  has been demonstrated to be important for
the high affinity and selectivity of bibn4096bs for the human
cgrp receptor; the equivalent residue e74 in  xxxg1928xxx  also
plays an important role in ligand binding. very interestingly,
e74w am2 displayed a reduced am potency in the absence of
any change in cgrp potency (hay et al., 2006a). furthermore, the opposite effect was seen with the reciprocal w74e
cgrp receptor, where am potency was selectively enhanced
and cgrp potency was not affected. to our knowledge, e74 is
the only single residue in  xxxg1928xxx  that has been demonstrated
to be important for a specific peptide binding event.

predicted helix 3
site-directed mutagenesis has been performed at seven positions within predicted a-helix 3 (table 4 and figure 2b). these
include two extracellular histidine residues (kuwasako et al.,
2008). alanine substitution at h110 did not affect the receptor function or expression when co-expressed with cl. on the
other hand, h97, which is the equivalent residue to h97 in
 xxxg1926xxx , could potentially be involved in forming the cl
binding interface. consistent with this hypothesis, h97a
caused a reduction in both am binding and potency.
however, the cell surface expression was difficult to interpret,
as the v5-tagged wt  xxxg1928xxx  showed significant cell surface
expression in the absence of cl (kuwasako et al., 2008). it can
be speculated that co-transfection of h97a  xxxg1928xxx  may have
reduced cl translocation to the cell surface.

conclusions
receptor–ligand interaction mechanisms for the calcitonin
family of peptides are challenging to understand due to the
multi-subunit composition of the receptors and potentially
complex stoichiometry (hilairet et al., 2001b; heroux et al.,
2007). structure–function studies of the ramps have provided
valuable information for understanding ligand and receptor
interactions for these complexes. that said, whether the residues in ramps directly confer receptor-specific pharmacology
through ligand interaction or act allosterically to modify the
receptor conformation to allow ligand binding is still an open
question. although this review has focused on cl/ramp
complexes, the potential role of different ramp regions and
residues should also be considered for other ramp receptor
complexes. the availability of more structural information for
ramps will enable a better interpretation of the mutagenesis
data; on the other hand, any predictions based on the structural information need experimental support. the parallel
analysis of structural and functional data should allow a more
confident elucidation of the residues that are involved in the
ligand and receptor interactions with ramps.
