 xxxg2239xxx  is a modulator of the  xxxg2149xxx .   xxxg2239xxx  (taar1) is a g protein-coupled receptor activated by a broad range of monoamines and amphetamine-related psychostimulants. recent studies demonstrated wide distribution of taar1 in brain, coexpression of taar1 with  xxxg2149xxx  (dat) in a subset of dopamine neurons in both mouse and rhesus monkey substantia nigra, and  xxxg2099xxx -modulated activation. this study explored whether taar1 could influence dat-mediated dopamine uptake and efflux. rhesus monkey taar1 expressed with dat in human embryonic kidney 293 cells was dose-dependently activated by dopamine or (+)-methamphetamine. this activation resulted in large camp increases and a transient reduction in [3h]dopamine accumulation within the cells, which was similar to the effect of dopamine  xxxg655xxx  (d1) or  xxxd1742xxx  treatment. in addition, taar1 effects on dopamine uptake could be blocked by a  xxxg1836xxx  or protein kinase c (pkc) inhibitor. [3h]dopamine efflux assays performed in dulbecco's modified eagle's medium displayed a taar1-dependent spontaneous [3h]dopamine efflux that was dose-dependently augmented by dopamine or (+)-methamphetamine and that was blocked by either methylphenidate or a pkc inhibitor. dat cells in krebs-hepes buffer had an apparent spontaneous [3h]dopamine loss, but it could not be blocked by either methylphenidate or a pkc inhibitor. taken together, this study provides evidence that taar1 is involved in functional regulation of dat and suggests that taar1 is a potentially important target for therapeutics for methamphetamine addiction.
