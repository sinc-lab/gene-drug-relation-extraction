2000. direct evidence for a specific k⫹ channel underlying the resting
membrane potential in glomus cells of the carotid body has been
absent. the product of the human ether-a-go-go–related gene (herg)
produces inward rectifier currents that are known to contribute to the
resting membrane potential in other neuronal cells. the goal of the
present study was to determine whether carotid body glomus cells
express herg-like k⫹ current, and if so, to determine whether a
herg-like current regulates the resting membrane potential. freshly
dissociated rabbit glomus cells under whole cell voltage clamp exhibited slowly decaying outward currents that activated 20 –30 mv
positive to the resting membrane potential. raising extracellular k⫹
revealed a slowly deactivating inward tail current indicative of
herg-like k⫹ current. herg-like currents were not found in cells
resembling type ii cells. the herg-like current was blocked by
 xxxd1923xxx  (dof) in a concentration-dependent manner (ic50 ⫽ 13 ⫾
4 nm, mean ⫾ se) and high concentrations of ba2⫹ (1 and 10 mm).
the biophysical and pharmacological characteristics of this inward
tail current suggest that it is conducted by a herg-like channel. the
steady-state activation properties of the herg-like current (vh ⫽
⫺44 ⫾ 2 mv) suggest that it is active at the resting membrane
potential in glomus cells. in whole cell, current-clamped glomus cells
(average resting membrane potential, ⫺ 48 ⫾ 4 mv), dof, but not
tetraethylammonium, caused a significant (13 mv) depolarizing shift
in the resting membrane potential. using fluorescence imaging, dof
increased [ca2⫹]i in isolated glomus cells. in an in-vitro carotid body
preparation, dof increased basal sensory discharge in the carotid
sinus nerve in a concentration-dependent manner. these results demonstrate that glomus cells express a herg-like current that is active
at, and responsible for controlling the resting membrane potential.

introduction

carotid bodies are sensory organs that regulate respiratory
responses to alterations in arterial blood oxygen. hypoxemia
(low arterial o2) augments the sensory discharge of the carotid
bodies, and the sensory information is conveyed via the carotid
sinus nerve to respiratory neurons in the brain stem. reflexes
arising from the carotid bodies are important for maintaining
homeostasis during hypoxemia that occur in many physiological situations including sojourn at high altitude, and in pathophysiological conditions such as sudden infant death syndrome

(sids) (perrin et al. 1984). morphologically the carotid body
is composed of neurotransmitter-enriched glomus (type i) cells
and glial-like type ii cells. there is much evidence that the
glomus cells are the initial sites of sensory transduction. it has
been proposed that hypoxia causes membrane depolarization in
glomus cells causing influx of ca2⫹ through voltage-gated
ca2⫹ channels, leading to release of neurotransmitter(s) that
act on apposing afferent nerve terminals to increase sensory
discharge in the carotid sinus nerve (for reviews see fidone et
al. 1990; gonzalez et al. 1994; prabhakar 1994).
the cellular basis for the initial depolarization of glomus
cells during hypoxia remains poorly understood. several studies have reported that hypoxia inhibits outward k⫹ currents in
glomus cells. therefore it was proposed that the hypoxiasensitive k⫹ channels contribute to the initial depolarization
that is essential for the transduction of the hypoxic stimulus
(lopez barneo et al. 1988; wyatt et al. 1995). however, recent
studies have questioned whether inhibition of these k⫹ channels is central to the transduction process at the carotid body.
first, these channels are not active at the reported resting
membrane potentials of glomus cells (gonzalez et al. 1994).
second, known blockers of these k⫹ channels had no affect on
basal or hypoxia stimulated sensory activity of the carotid body
or on intracellular ca2⫹ ([ca2⫹]i) in isolated glomus cells
(buckler 1997; cheng and donnelly 1995; lahiri et al. 1998;
however, see wyatt et al. 1995). more recently, buckler (1997)
identified a k⫹-selective “leak” conductance that is sensitive to
hypoxia. however, its role in transduction remains elusive,
because there is no known selective pharmacological blocker
of this conductance. consequently, which k⫹ current regulates
the resting membrane potential and the role of k⫹ channels in
the transduction process of the hypoxic stimulus remain uncertain. it follows that identification of specific channel(s)
active at the resting membrane potential is of seminal importance to understand the basis for hypoxic depolarization in
glomus cells.
inwardly rectifying k⫹ channels contribute to the resting
membrane potential in many different cell types. one such
channel is the protein encoded by the human ether-a-go-go–
related gene (herg). herg k⫹ channels were originally
identified as molecular targets for mutations underlying one
form of the long qt syndrome, a genetic disease with delayed
cardiac repolarization (curran et al. 1995). the main features
of herg current are a peculiar inward rectification mechanism
and its unique sensitivity to methanesulfonanilide drugs such
as e-4031 and  xxxd1923xxx  (ficker et al. 1998; jurkiewicz and

herg-like k⫹ current in glomus cells

sanguinetti 1993; smith et al. 1996; snyders and chaudhary
1996; trudeau et al. 1995). herg-like channels have also
been identified in cells of neural crest origin, such as neuroblastoma cell lines, pc12 cells, and quail neural crest cells,
where they regulate the resting membrane potential (arcangeli
et al. 1995, 1997; bianchi et al. 1998; shi et al. 1997). the goal
of the present study was to determine whether carotid body
glomus cells express herg-like k⫹ current, and if so, to
determine whether herg-like currents regulate the resting
membrane potential. however, identification of herg-like
currents in glomus cells is difficult due to the presence of a
large outward k⫹ current. therefore we took advantage of the
unique characteristics of herg channels to isolate the herglike current. if herg current is present, stepping to hyperpolarized potentials from a holding potential of 0 mv (to inactivate the outward k⫹ current) should give rise to a rapidly
activating (actually removal of inactivation) inward k⫹ current
that decays in a time- and voltage-dependent manner as the
channels close. this process forms a “nose” in the tail current
that is characteristic of herg current and should be blocked
by  xxxd1923xxx .
based on the criteria above, our results show that glomus
cells of the rabbit carotid body express herg-like k⫹ current.
most importantly, the characteristics of this herg-like current
suggest that it is active at the resting membrane potential.
furthermore, block of herg-like current depolarizes glomus
cells, increases [ca2⫹]i, and augments sensory activity under
normoxia in an in-vitro carotid body preparation. this study is
the first to show the molecular basis for a k⫹ current active
around the resting membrane potential that is directly involved
in controlling the resting membrane potential in glomus cells of
the carotid body. preliminary results from this study have been
reported previously (overholt et al. 1999).

the extracellular solution was changed using a fast-flow device consisting of a linear array of borosilicate glass capillary tubings (overholt and prabhakar 1997).

membrane potential recording
membrane potential measurements were made using an axopatch
200 amplifier in the current-clamp mode. the intracellular solution
had the following composition (in mm) 120 k glutamate, 20 kcl, 5
mg-atp, 5 egta, 5 hepes, and 0.1 tris-gtp, ph 7.2. cells were
perfused with krebs-heinseliet buffer equilibrated with 5% co2 in air
(in mm): 120 nacl, 4.8 kcl, 1.5 cacl2, 2.2  xxxd2534xxx , 1.2 nah2po4,
25 nahco3, and 11 glucose, ph 7.4. drugs were added to the
extracellular perfusate. input resistance was measured from hyperpolarizing current injections of ⫺10 pa applied from the resting membrane potential.

measurements of [ca2⫹]i
changes in [ca2⫹]i in individual glomus cells were measured as
described previously (bright et al. 1996). briefly, cells were plated on
glass coverslips and preincubated in 3 ml of serum free dmem
medium containing 5 ␮m indo-1-pe3 (texas fluorescence lab) for
60 min at 37 °c. subsequently, they were placed in a gas-tight,
temperature regulated chamber (bioptics) and superfused with hank’s
 xxxd2988xxx  (hbss) equilibrated with 21% oxygen and 5%
co2. images were recorded with a zeiss lsm-410 equipped with a
uv laser. excitation was 360 nm with emission at 408 and 475 nm.
data are expressed as ratio values due to unstable rmin and rmax
values within the cell using either  xxxd2379xxx  or  xxxd595xxx -a23187. cells
responding to hypoxia with increases in [ca2⫹]i were considered to be
glomus cells.

recording of carotid body sensory discharge in vitro
methods

isolation of rabbit carotid body cells
carotid body cells were acutely isolated from adult male rabbits as
described previously (overholt and prabhakar 1997). dissociated
cells were maintained at 37°c in a co2 incubator in medium composed of a 50/50 mixture of dulbecco’s modified eagle’s medium
(dmem) and ham f12 (gibco) supplemented with antibiotics
(penicillin and streptomycin), 10% fetal bovine serum, and insulin,
transferrin, and selenium (its, sigma). experiments were performed
at room temperature. cells were used within 4 –36 h.

membrane current recording
k⫹ currents were measured in the whole cell configuration of the
patch-clamp technique (hamill et al. 1981) using an axopatch 200
amplifier (axon instruments). patch pipettes had resistances of 2–5
m⍀ when filled with (in mm) 100 k aspartate, 20 kcl, 2 mgcl2, 1
cacl2, 10 egta, and 10 hepes, ph 7.2, adjusted to 300 mosm with
glucose. the standard extracellular solution was composed of (in mm)
140 nacl, 5 kcl, 1 mgcl2, 1.8 cacl2, 10 hepes, and 10 glucose, ph
7.4. the k⫹ concentration in the extracellular solution was varied by
equimolar replacement of nacl with kcl. unless indicated, current
recordings were not corrected for leak. current traces were sampled at
2.4 khz and filtered at 1 khz for off-line analysis. in some recordings,
series resistance errors were compensated to at least 70%. pclamp
programs (axon instruments) were used for data acquisition and
analysis. the peak of the tail currents was determined by extrapolation
of the deactivating tail current to the beginning of the voltage step.

the method for recording sensory discharge from isolated carotid
bodies has been described previously (prabhakar et al. 1995). briefly,
the carotid bifurcation along with the carotid sinus nerve was excised
from anesthetized, adult rabbits. the carotid bifurcation was placed in
a recording chamber, and the common carotid artery was cannulated
and perfused with dmem solution (ph 7.3; temperature, 36 ⫾ 1°c)
at a rate of 3.5 ⫾ 0.5 (se) ml/min. chemoreceptor activity was
recorded from the sinus nerve using platinum-iridium electrodes.
sensory discharge frequency is expressed as impulses/second. hypoxia (po2 ⫽ 38 ⫾ 6 mmhg for 1–2 min) augmented the sensory
activity, suggesting that the action potentials were of chemoreceptor
origin. the superfusion medium was equilibrated with room air (normoxia). the partial pressure of oxygen (po2) in the medium was
measured using a blood gas analyzer.

drugs
dofetiliden-[4-(-{-[4-(methanesulfonamino)-phenoxyl]-ethylethylamino}ethyl)phenyl] methansulfonamide was a gift from pfizer central research. all other chemicals were purchased from sigma.

data analysis
statistical analysis was evaluated by a paired or unpaired t-test, or
one-way anova combined with tukey’s test, where appropriate. p
values ⬍0.05 were considered significant. summary data are expressed as means ⫾ se.

glomus cells of the rabbit carotid body express a herg-like
k⫹ current
dissociated cells from carotid bodies contain both glomus
and type ii cells. glomus, but not type ii cells, express na⫹
and large, outward, delayed rectifier-like k⫹ currents
(urena et al. 1989). therefore we used the presence of large,
outward k⫹ currents and inward na⫹ current to distinguish
glomus cells from type ii cells (overholt and prabhakar
1997). figure 1a shows typical currents elicited by 75-ms
depolarizing voltage-clamp steps from a glomus cell held at
⫺85 mv measured in an extracellular solution containing 5
mm k⫹. rapidly inactivating, inward na⫹ currents followed by large, outward k⫹ currents typical of glomus cells

following equation: i ⫽ a0 ⫹ a1 exp(⫺t/tau1) ⫹ a2(⫺t/tau2), where a0 to a2
are amplitude coefficients and tau1,2 are the time constants of current decay.
time constants were 82.9 ⫾ 8.3 and 1,125 ⫾ 185 ms at 0 mv and 74.2 ⫾ 7.1
and 902 ⫾ 108 ms at 40 mv (n ⫽ 11). c: steady-state activation and

73.0 ⫾ 11.4 and 838 ⫾ 121 ms at 40 mv (n ⫽ 4 – 8). the time-dependent
inactivation process showed little voltage and/or k⫹ dependence. note the

can be seen. figure 1b shows the outward k⫹ currents
elicited by longer (2.8 ms) depolarizing voltage-clamp steps
(note, the na⫹ current cannot be resolved on this time
scale). outward currents were slowly decaying and could be
described best by double exponential functions (see legend).
figure 1c shows the activation and inactivation properties
of the outward k⫹ current. activation properties were determined by analyzing peak current amplitudes using protocols shown in fig. 1b. the threshold for activation was
reached between ⫺40 and ⫺30 mv and was half-maximal at
4.7 mv. to determine steady-state inactivation, cells were
held at ⫹20 mv and stepped for 1 s from ⫹20 to ⫺130 mv
in 10-mv increments. peak currents were analyzed on return
to ⫹20 mv. steady-state inactivation could be fitted by a
boltzman equation with vh at ⫺73 mv. the characteristics
of the outward k⫹ currents are similar to those described in
rabbit glomus cells by other investigators (lopez-lopez et
al. 1993) and suggest that they would not be active at the
resting membrane potential in glomus cells.
once establishing that a recording was from a glomus
cell, we tested whether the same cells also express herglike k⫹ current. herg-like currents cannot be readily identified under the conditions in fig. 1b, due to rapid inactivation at depolarized potentials, but can be substantially
amplified at more hyperpolarized potentials by raising the
concentration of extracellular k⫹ ([k⫹]o). figure 1d shows
an example of currents elicited by the same protocol and in
the same cell shown in fig. 1b, but the extracellular solution
was changed to one containing 70 mm k⫹ by equimolar
replacement of nacl by kcl. elevating [k⫹]o did not
change any of the kinetic parameters found in normal k⫹.
the holding current measured at ⫺85 mv showed only a
minor increase from ⫺12.8 ⫾ 1.8 to ⫺23.8 ⫾ 2.1 pa (n ⫽
7) in 5 and 70 mm [k⫹]o, respectively. this small change in
current amplitudes could not be prevented by 50 ␮m ba2⫹,
which should block current conducted by classical inward
rectifier k⫹ channels in the kir family. rather, fig. 1d
shows that the most dramatic change observed in current
recordings performed in elevated [k⫹]o was the appearance
of a slowly deactivating tail current component (arrow),
indicative of inward rectifying k⫹ current.
figure 2 further characterizes this inward rectifier k⫹ current in glomus cells. figure 2a shows that this current activates
very slowly. after a 50-ms depolarization, tail currents elicited
on return to ⫺85 mv were instantaneous and decayed with a
time constant of 22.1 ⫾ 2.3 ms. more importantly, after a 3-s
depolarization, a slow component appeared that showed delayed onset and decayed with a much slower time constant of
157.7 ⫾ 1.4 ms (n ⫽ 3). the slow development of this
component suggests that the current activates slowly (i.e.,
seconds, not milliseconds) as is characteristic for herg channels. this “nose” that develops over time in tail currents
recorded in elevated [k⫹]o indicates that the inward rectifier
k⫹ current is conducted by a herg-like k⫹ channel. figure
2b shows current traces elicited by a 200-ms step from a
holding potential of 0 to ⫺120 mv in a glomus cell. this
protocol is optimal for observing the herg-like current in
glomus cells, because herg channels are maximally activated
at 0 mv and the large, outward k⫹ currents are inactivated. it

gene (herg)–like current in glomus cells. a: envelope of tails test illustrates
slow activation of the herg-like current. cells were held at ⫺85 mv, stepped
to ⫹10 mv for variable time (200-ms increments between 50 and 3,050 ms; 40
mm [k⫹]o) and tails were analyzed on return to ⫺85 mv. series resistance
errors were compensated to 70%. b: current traces elicited from a glomus cell
by 200-ms steps from 0 to ⫺120 mv in an extracellular solutions containing
low (5 mm) or high (40 mm) k⫹. transient outward currents were inactivated
to a large extent at 0 mv. however, on repolarization to 0 mv, outward
currents can be seen due to removal of inactivation by hyperpolarizing pulses.
c: family of current traces from a glomus cell elicited by 200-ms voltage steps
from ⫺20 to ⫺140 mv in ⫺20-mv increments (40 mm [k⫹]o; hp ⫽ 0 mv).
voltage protocols shown on top of a and c, dotted lines indicate 0 current
level.

can be seen that increasing the extracellular k⫹ concentration
from 5 to 40 mm clearly exposes the herg-like tail current
and suggests that it conducts k⫹. figure 2c shows a family of
inward tail currents elicited by hyperpolarizing steps from 0
mv. herg-like tail currents first increased for a few milliseconds, due to rapid removal of inactivation, and then deactivated
in a time- and voltage-dependent manner. the delayed rectifier-like outward currents can also be seen on return to 0 mv
due to removal of inactivation during the hyperpolarizing
steps. these results show that the inward rectifier current in
glomus cells conducts k⫹ (increase in conductance in response
to increase k⫹), requires hundreds of milliseconds to activate
(slow development of the tail current), and deactivates in a
time- and voltage-dependent manner (channel closing). these
are all characteristic of currents conducted by herg-like k⫹
channels identified in other cells (bianchi et al. 1998). in
contrast, type ii cells, identified by characteristic small outward

heterologously expressed herg channels are blocked with
highest affinity and selectivity by class iii antiarrhythmic
methanesulfonanilide drugs such as  xxxd1923xxx  (arcangeli et al.
1997). to further confirm that herg channels underlie the
herg-like current in glomus cells, we tested the effect of
 xxxd1923xxx  on this current. figure 3a shows characteristic
herg-like tail currents elicited on hyperpolarization from 0 to
⫺120 mv before and during exposure to 0.01 or 1 ␮m  xxxd1923xxx  in the extracellular solution. it can be seen that herg-like
k⫹ currents in glomus cells were blocked by  xxxd1923xxx  in a
concentration-dependent manner. however, the effects of micromolar concentrations of  xxxd1923xxx  were not reversible. the
effect of  xxxd1923xxx  on the herg-like tail current is further
characterized in fig. 3b, which shows the relative effect of a
range of concentrations of  xxxd1923xxx  on the current. from these
experiments, we determined the ic50 of  xxxd1923xxx  block to be
12.7 ⫾ 4.2 nm (n ⫽ 11). in marked contrast, transient outward
currents were not affected (1 ␮m  xxxd1923xxx  actually increased
the outward current elicited on return to 0 mv by 7.1 ⫾ 6.0%,
see fig. 3a; n ⫽ 8).
cations such as ba2⫹ have been used to differentiate herglike inward currents elicited in elevated [k⫹]o from classical
inward rectifier currents. herg-like k⫹ currents, as well as
heterologously expressed herg channels, proved to be less
sensitive to block by external ba2⫹ than inward rectifiers in the
kir gene family (kubo et al. 1993). in marked contrast to the
strong block of classical inward rectifiers by 50 ␮m ba2⫹, fig.
3c shows that the herg-like current in glomus cells is little
affected by 50 ␮m ba2⫹ (average reduction 7.5 ⫾ 1.1% at
⫺120 mv; n ⫽ 5). figure 3c also shows that the herg-like
current is reduced by high (mm) concentrations of ba2⫹. one
and 10 mm ba2⫹ reduced herg-like currents at ⫺120 mv by
34.1 ⫾ 1.7 (n ⫽ 5) and 61.7 ⫾ 4.2% (n ⫽ 4), respectively.
outward currents at 0 mv were only moderately reduced.
because tea has been shown to block outward k⫹ currents in
glomus cells, we tested the effects of tea on the herg-like
current. figure 3d shows that 10 mm tea blocked a much
larger proportion of the outward current elicited on return to 0
mv (77.3 ⫾ 4.1%; n ⫽ 8) than of the herg-like current
elicited at ⫺120 mv (35.9 ⫾ 2.5%; n ⫽ 8). these results
demonstrate that the pharmacological profile of the herg-like
current in glomus cells is similar to that described for herg
currents in other cells (bianchi et al. 1998), and further support
the idea that inward rectifier k⫹ current in glomus cells is
conducted by herg-like channels.
herg-like k⫹ current regulates resting membrane potential
in glomus cells
we next wanted to elucidate the functional role of the
herg-like current in glomus cells. to determine whether the
herg-like current is active at the resting membrane potential,
we first examined the steady-state activation properties of this
current. figure 4a shows a family of current traces recorded on
return to ⫺100 mv after a range of 27.6 s test potentials from

a glomus cell exposed to an extracellular solution containing
70 mm k⫹. the results of these experiments are summarized
in fig. 4b, which shows normalized current measured on return
to ⫺100 mv. it can be seen that the data are well fit by a
boltzman equation with vh at ⫺44.0 ⫾ 2.1 mv and slope
conductance k of ⫺10.5 ⫾ 2.1 (n ⫽ 7). the steady-state
activation properties suggest that the herg-like k⫹ current in
glomus cells is active around ⫺50 mv, which is close to the
resting membrane potential of these cells (see table 1).
to assess whether herg-like current could regulate the
resting membrane potential in glomus cells, we examined the
effect of  xxxd1923xxx  on the resting membrane potential. for
these current-clamp experiments we used nanomolar concentrations to demonstrate the reversibility of  xxxd1923xxx  effects. in
addition, a bicarbonate buffered extracellular solution was
used. stable measurements of the resting membrane potential
were recorded in 44 glomus cells current clamped in the whole
cell configuration. only five of these cells displayed spontaneous action potentials, which diminished over time during
whole cell dialysis. on average, the resting membrane potential
was ⫺48.3 ⫾ 1.9 mv (range ⫺67.2 to ⫺33.2 mv, n ⫽ 32), and
the input resistance was 3.0 ⫾ 0.3 g⍀ (n ⫽ 12). most importantly, 150 nm  xxxd1923xxx  caused a significant and reversible
depolarization of ⫺13 mv. in contrast, 10 mm tea, which
completely blocked the large, outward current, had no effect on
the resting membrane potential. the results from these experiments are summarized in table 1. these results show that the

herg-like current is involved in regulating the resting membrane potential in glomus cells.
 xxxd1923xxx  increases [ca2⫹]i in glomus cells
a depolarization-induced influx of ca2⫹ through membrane
ca2⫹ channels is an essential step in chemotransduction at the
carotid body. therefore if the herg-like current is active at
the resting membrane potential, then inhibition of this current
should cause depolarization and elevate [ca2⫹]i in glomus
cells. to test this possibility, we monitored the effect of  xxxd1923xxx  on [ca2⫹]i in glomus cells using indo-1-pe3, a calciumsensitive fluorescent dye. as a control, we also tested the effect
of tetraethylammonium (tea) on [ca2⫹]i. figure 4c shows
the effect of 10 mm tea and 1 ␮m  xxxd1923xxx  on [ca2⫹]i in a
representative glomus cell. it can be seen that tea had no
effect on [ca2⫹]i, whereas the same cell responded with a
prompt increase in [ca2⫹]i in response to  xxxd1923xxx . [ca2⫹]i
returned slowly to baseline levels after wash out of  xxxd1923xxx .
of the 43 cells tested, 33 responded with an increase in [ca2⫹]i
in response to  xxxd1923xxx  (change in ratio from 1.2 ⫾ 0.02 to
2.0 ⫾ 0.03), similar to that seen with the control response to
hypoxia (po2 ⫽ 32 ⫾ 4 mmhg; change in ratio from 1.2 ⫾
0.02 to 1.8 ⫾ 0.02). in contrast, tea caused an increase in
[ca2⫹]i in only one of these cells (fig. 4d). these results
suggest that the herg-like current plays a functional role in
glomus cells at the cellular level.

of concentrations of  xxxd1923xxx  on baseline sensory discharge
from the carotid sinus nerve in a representative preparation. as
can be seen,  xxxd1923xxx  increased the sensory discharge in a
concentration-dependent manner. as little as 0.3 ␮m  xxxd1923xxx 
significantly enhanced the sensory activity, and at 3 ␮m,
baseline activity was increased by 98 ⫾ 6% (p ⬍ 0.01; n ⫽ 8).
these results are summarized in fig. 5b. the effects of  xxxd1923xxx  on baseline carotid body activity were first discernable
between 3 and 5 min, had plateaued by 10 min, and did not
return to control levels within 15 min after termination due to
the high concentrations used. these results demonstrate that
block of herg channels mimics the effects of hypoxia on the
sensory discharge of the carotid body and establish the functional significance of the herg-like current at the organ level.
discussion

herg channels are members of the voltage-gated ether-ago-go k⫹ channel family and are characterized by an unusually slow current activation and deactivation, paired with a fast
c-type inactivation mechanism. in the present study, we
clearly identify a herg-like current component in glomus
cells using electrophysiological and pharmacological methods.
we found herg-like tail currents after long depolarizing steps
under high [k⫹]o only in those cells that displayed the large,
outward k⫹ current, characteristic of glomus cells (urena et al.
1989). herg-like current was not found in cells displaying
only small outward k⫹ currents characteristic of type ii cells,
suggesting that expression of the herg-like current in the
carotid body is confined to glomus cells. whether nerve and/or
vascular tissue in the carotid body also express herg-like
current remains to be established. the herg-like tail current
in glomus cells increased for a few milliseconds before deac-

tivating at hyperpolarized membrane potentials, a characteristic unique to herg channels. this “nose” clearly identifies
this current as carried by herg-like gene products because it
results from a unique inactivation mechanism that recovers
rapidly at negative potentials. the kinetics of the currents
(especially fig. 2c) are identical to herg-like currents identified by electrophysiological and molecular means in other cell
lines (bianchi et al. 1998). further, the herg-like current is
carried by k⫹ ions (fig. 2b), shows time- and voltage-dependent deactivation (fig. 2c), slow current activation (fig. 2a),
and steady-state activation (fig. 4b), all characteristics of
herg channel currents. however, it was not possible to characterize herg-like outward currents in glomus cells because
of the much larger outward k⫹ currents and the rapid inactivation process at depolarized potentials. this precludes a quantitative analysis of the time course for activation of the herglike current.
the kinetic evidence that a herg channel protein conducts
the herg-like current in glomus cells is further corroborated
by pharmacological evidence. in contrast to conventional inward rectifier k⫹ channels (kubo et al. 1993), the herg-like
currents were little affected by micromolar concentrations of
ba2⫹. however, they were inhibited by mm concentrations of
ba2⫹ as reported for herg-like channels studied in neuroblastoma and microglial cells (arcangeli et al. 1995; zhou et
al. 1998). furthermore, inward tails were blocked with nanomolar affinity by  xxxd1923xxx , a potent and specific blocker of
herg k⫹ channels (ficker et al. 1998; snyders and
chaudhary 1996). consistent with previous reports we also
found that the effects of  xxxd1923xxx  were only partially reversible at concentrations higher than 1 ␮m (ficker et al. 1998).
these results show that a herg channel protein conducts the
herg-like current in glomus cells. herg currents arise from
expression of three closely related herg genes,  xxxg1246xxx –3,
which are widely expressed in nervous tissue (shi et al. 1997;
warmke and ganetzky 1994). however, which of the specific
herg gene(s) are expressed in glomus cells remain to be
investigated.
several observations in the present study show that the
herg-like k⫹ current plays a functional role in regulating the
resting membrane potential in rabbit glomus cells. activation
of the herg-like k⫹ current was half-maximal at ⫺44 mv,
and the threshold for current activation was reached between
⫺70 and ⫺60 mv (fig. 4b). this is sufficiently negative to
stabilize the membrane potential between ⫺65 and ⫺40 mv,
as measured in current-clamp recording from glomus cells
(table 1). on the other hand, it is not expected that the
o2-sensitive, outward k⫹ currents would be open at the resting
membrane potential (lopez-lopez et al. 1993; wyatt et al.
1995) (also fig. 1c). furthermore, tea, which blocks the
o2-sensitive k⫹ currents, neither depolarized nor increased
[ca2⫹]i in glomus cells (buckler 1997; cheng and donnelly
1995; lahiri et al. 1998) (also fig. 4c and table 1). in contrast,
 xxxd1923xxx  significantly depolarized glomus cells and increased
[ca2⫹]i. however, whether  xxxd1923xxx  affects hypoxia-induced
depolarization and [ca2⫹]i in isolated glomus cells remains to
be investigated. these results demonstrate that block of the
herg-like current, like hypoxia, causes depolarization and
increases [ca2⫹]i in glomus cells.
the role of o2-sensitive k⫹ channels in the transduction
process at the carotid body has also been questioned because

known blockers of these channels (i.e.,  xxxd1804xxx , tea,
and charybdotoxin) had no affect on basal sensory discharge of
intact carotid bodies (buckler 1997; cheng and donnelly 1995;
lahiri et al. 1998). in contrast,  xxxd1923xxx  significantly augmented baseline sensory activity in the isolated carotid body in
the present study. the fact that we have identified a herg-like
k⫹ current in glomus cells that is blocked by  xxxd1923xxx  suggests that these effects are mediated by effects on glomus cells
themselves. in support of this idea, another report showed that
millimolar concentrations of ba2⫹ augment sensory discharge
of the carotid body (donnelly 1997). this augmentation could
be due to block of the herg-like k⫹ current, because we
found that mm ba2⫹ inhibits this current (fig. 3c). in addition,
the increase in nerve activity in response to hypoxia was
qualitatively and quantitatively comparable with that seen in
response to  xxxd1923xxx . hypoxia (po2 ⫽ 38 ⫾ 6 mmhg) augmented the baseline sensory discharge by 87 ⫾ 6%. however,
given the constraints of the experimental conditions, we cannot
rule out possible effects of  xxxd1923xxx  on sensory nerve endings.
nonetheless, this is the first study to show that block of a
specific k⫹ channel augments the sensory discharge of the
intact carotid body. it should also be noted that the concentration of  xxxd1923xxx  required to produce augmentation of sensory
discharge in the intact carotid body was relatively high and the
response did not reach a plateau even with 3 ␮m. this is not
unexpected because isolated cells and whole organs are very
different preparations and the effective concentration near the
glomus cell could be quite different because of the hydrophobic nature of  xxxd1923xxx . it is possible that the effect of  xxxd1923xxx  did not reach a plateau because it has nonspecific effects at
higher doses. most importantly, the results from our physiological studies clearly show that modulation of the herg-like
current has a significant effect on the sensory discharge of the
intact carotid body. this suggests that this current could be
involved in the initial depolarization that is linked to the
expression of the hypoxic response.
from the results of the present study, we cannot say whether
or not the herg-like current participates in chemosensing or
is sensitive to o2. however, recent studies suggest that the
herg channel protein is a prime candidate for o2 sensing. for
example, the herg protein contains a pas domain that is
known to be sensitive to o2 in other proteins (pellequer et al.
1999). however, the mechanism by which o2 modulates channel activity may not be straightforward. one possibility is that
hypoxia could directly modulate k⫹ channel activity. alternatively, hypoxia could modulate k⫹ currents by affecting the
redox state of the cell and/or altering the level of reactive
oxygen species (ros) (acker 1994). in line with this idea,
ros have been shown to modulate the activity of herg
channels expressed in xenopus oocytes (taglialatela et al.
1997). therefore it is possible that o2 chemosensing could
involve effects of hypoxia on herg either directly or indirectly through changes in ros. these effects on herg channel activity could contribute to the depolarization responsible
for the initiation of sensory activity. we are currently investigating these possibilities.
