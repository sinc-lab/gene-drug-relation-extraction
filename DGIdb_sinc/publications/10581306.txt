 atp‐sensitive potassium (k atp ) channels are composed of pore‐forming (kir6. x ) and regulatory sulphonylurea receptor (sur x ) subunits. we have isolated a novel sur variant (sur1bdelta33) from a hypothalamic cdna library. this variant lacked exon 33 and introduced a frameshift that produced a truncated protein lacking the second nucleotide binding domain (nbd2). it was expressed at low levels in hypothalamus, midbrain, heart and the insulin‐secreting beta‐cell line min6.

 we examined the properties of k atp  channels composed of  xxxg1250xxx  and sur1bdelta33 by recording macroscopic currents in membrane patches excised from  xenopus  oocytes expressing these subunits. we also investigated the effect of truncating  xxxg19xxx  at either the start (sur1bt1) or end (sur1bt2) of exon 33 on k atp  channel properties.

  xxxg1250xxx /sur1bdelta33 showed an enhanced open probability ( p o = 0.6 at ‐60 mv) and a reduced atp sensitivity ( k i , 86 mu m ), when compared with wild‐type channels ( p o = 0.3;  k i , 22 mu m ). however,  xxxg1250xxx /sur1bt1 and  xxxg1250xxx /sur1bt2 resembled the wild‐type channel in their  p o  and atp sensitivity.

 neither mgadp, nor the k +  channel opener  xxxd1868xxx , enhanced  xxxg1250xxx /sur1bdelta33,  xxxg1250xxx /sur1bt1 or  xxxg1250xxx /sur1bt2 currents, consistent with the idea that these agents require an intact nbd2 for their action. sulphonylureas blocked k atp  channels containing any of the three sur variants, but in excised patches the extent of block was less than that for the wild‐type channel. in intact cells, the extent of sulphonylurea block of  xxxg1250xxx /sur1bdelta33 was greater than that in excised patches and was comparable to that found for wild‐type channels.

 our results demonstrate that nbd2 is not essential for functional expression or sulphonylurea block, but is required for k atp  channel activation by k +  channel openers and nucleotides. some of the unusual properties of  xxxg1250xxx /sur1bdelta33 resemble those reported for the k atp  channel of ventromedial hypothalamic (vmh) neurones, but the fact that this mrna is expressed at low levels in many other tissues makes it less likely that sur1bdelta33 serves as the sur subunit for the vmh k atp  channel.
                   
 
 
 atp‐sensitive potassium (k atp ) channels are found in a wide variety of tissues, including pancreatic beta‐cells, heart, smooth and skeletal muscles, neurones, peripheral axons and epithelial cells (for review see  ashcroft & ashcroft, 1990 ). they play important physiological roles in all these tissues. the archetypal k atp  channel, such as those found in pancreatic beta‐cells and cardiac muscle, is highly atp sensitive, being half‐blocked by 10‐30 mu m  atp. it has a single‐channel conductance of 60‐80 ps, is inhibited by sulphonylurea drugs and is activated by k +  channel openers and by magnesium nucleotides such as mgadp. k atp  channels found in ventromedial hypothalamic (vmh) neurones appear less sensitive to atp, with millimolar concentrations being needed to produce significant block. they also differ in their single‐channel conductance and pharmacological properties ( ashford  et al.  1990 a,b ;  sellers  et al.  1992 ;  routh  et al.  1997 ).
          
 cloning of k atp  channel genes from beta‐cells, heart and smooth muscle has revealed that these channels are composed of two types of subunit, kir6. x  and sur x , with predicted molecular masses of 43 and 140 kda, respectively. these subunits coassemble in an octameric (4:4) complex ( clement  et al.  1997 ;  inagaki  et al.  1997 ;  shyng & nichols, 1997 ). kir6. x  is a member of the family of inwardly rectifying k +  channels, while sur x  (the sulphonylurea receptor) belongs to the atp‐binding cassette (abc) transporter superfamily ( inagaki  et al.  1995 a ;  sakura  et al.  1995 ;  aguilar‐bryan  et al.  1995 ). like other abc transporters, sur x  has multiple transmembrane domains and two large cytosolic loops (nbd1 and nbd2) that contain consensus sequences for nucleotide binding and hydrolysis. kir6. x  has no obvious consensus sequence for nucleotide binding; nevertheless, it is now clear that kir6. x  forms the k atp  channel pore and contains the site at which atp mediates channel inhibition ( tucker  et al.  1997, 1998 ). sur serves as a regulatory subunit that endows the channel with sensitivity to the stimulatory effects of mgadp and k +  channel openers, and to the inhibitory effects of sulphonylureas; in addition, it enhances the blocking action of atp (the  k i  shifts from 100 to 10 mu m ) and increases the channel open probability ( p o ) ( nichols  et al.  1996 ;  trapp & ashcroft, 1997 ;  tucker  et al.  1997 ;  proks & ashcroft, 1997 ;  gribble  et al.  1997 c ;  shyng  et al.  1997 b ;  ashcroft & gribble, 1998 ).
          
 to date, two kir6. x  genes have been described, kir6.1 and  xxxg1250xxx  ( inagaki  et al.  1995 a,b ;  sakura  et al.  1995 ). two closely related sur x  genes,  xxxg19xxx  and  xxxg20xxx , have also been cloned ( aguilar‐bryan  et al.  1995 ;  inagaki  et al.  1996 ;  isomoto  et al . 1996 ). a number of different splice variants of  xxxg20xxx  have been described (for review, see  ashcroft & gribble, 1998 ).  xxxg1250xxx  serves as a common pore‐forming subunit for k atp  channels in a number of tissues, while the different surs account for the variable sensitivity to k +  channel openers and sulphonylureas. thus, the beta‐cell k atp  channel is composed of  xxxg1250xxx  and  xxxg19xxx , that of cardiac and skeletal muscle consists of  xxxg1250xxx  and sur2a ( inagaki  et al.  1996 ), and in the brain single‐cell pcr studies have identified  xxxg1250xxx / xxxg19xxx  and  xxxg1250xxx /sur2b combinations in substantia nigra neurones ( liss  et al.  1999 ),  xxxg1250xxx / xxxg19xxx  in vagal neurones ( karschin  et al.  1998 ) and kir6.1/ xxxg19xxx  in striatal cholinergic interneurones and vmh neurones ( lee  et al.  1998, 1999 ). in this paper we investigate whether additional types of kir6. x  and sur x  genes, or splice variants of known surs, exist in brain. we focus our studies on the ventromedial hypothalamus, as the k atp  channels of this region are known to exhibit novel properties.

  molecular biology 
 
  isolation of mrna. 
 the region containing the vmh was isolated from the brains of 11 wistar rats (∼5 mg per rat) or from 4 brains of c57bl/6j mice. these fragments inevitably also contained the arcuate nucleus, but we attempted to exclude the lateral nucleus of the hypothalamus. animals were stunned by concussion of the brain. they were then decapitated, the brain was removed and the hypothalamus was quickly isolated. polya +  rna was purified using an mrna purification kit (stratagene, amsterdam, the netherlands) and was used for making a cdna library (600 ng, rat) or for rt‐pcr (100 ng, mouse). a similar method was used to prepare polya +  rna from mouse heart and midbrain and from the mouse insulin‐secreting beta‐cell line min6.
                
 
 
  screening of cdna library. 
 a hypothalamic cdna library was constructed using a zap express cdna synthesis kit (stratagene). this library (0.5 × 10 5  independent clones) was screened under low‐stringency conditions (hybridised with 30 % formamide, 5 × denhardt's, 5 × sspe, 0.5 % sds, 100 mug ml −1  denatured salmon sperm dna at 37°c and washed with 2 × ssc, 0.2 % sds at room temperature) with probes for kir6. x  and sur x . a mixed probe containing full length kir6.1 and  xxxg1250xxx  was used for isolating kir6. x  genes. to detect sur x , the probe consisted of nbd1 and nbd2 of  xxxg19xxx  and  xxxg20xxx . pbk‐cmv phagemids containing cdna inserts of positive clones were excised using exassist helper phage (stratagene) and sequenced.
                
 
 
  rt‐pcr. 
 reverse transcription was carried out with 100 ng polya +  rna. first strand cdna was synthesised for 1 h at 37°c in reverse transcription buffer (gibco brl, paisley, uk) containing random hexamer primers (final concentration, 5 mu m ; boehringer mannheim, lewes, uk), dithiothreitol (final concentration, 20 m m ), the four deoxyribonucleotide triphosphates (dntps; final concentration, 0.5 m m  each; pharmacia, st albans, uk), 20 u ribonuclease inhibitor (promega, southampton, uk) and 100 u reverse transcriptase (superscript ii, gibco‐brl). the total rt‐reaction volume was 10 mul. the cdna was kept at ‐70°c until pcr amplification.
                
 pcr amplification of  xxxg19xxx , sur2a/b, kir6.1 and  xxxg1250xxx  was carried out using the specific primers reported previously ( liss  et al.  1999 ). in addition, we also performed pcr amplification with primers flanking exon 33 of  xxxg19xxx : aag ctc ctg gag tac‐ acg ga (sense); ctc tgg gtc cag gtt gaa tc (antisense). pcr amplification was carried out using a hot start protocol in a final volume of 100 mul containing 1 mul of the rt‐reaction solution, 100 pmol of each primer, 0.2 m m  dntps (pharmacia), 1.5 m m  mgcl 2 , 50 m m  kcl, 20 m m  tris‐hcl (ph 8.4) and 2.5 u taq polymerase (gibco brl) in a perkin elmer thermal cycler 480c, with the following protocol: 3 min at 94°c followed by 35 cycles (94°c for 30 s, 58°c for 60 s, 72°c for 3 min) and a final elongation period of 7 min at 72°c.
                
 to investigate the presence and size of the amplified fragments, 15 mul aliquots of pcr products were separated by electrophoresis and visualised in ethidium bromide‐stained agarose gels (2 %). the predicted sizes for  xxxg19xxx  and sur1delta33 were 655 and 524 bp, respectively. the pcr products were verified by direct sequencing. 
 
 
 
  expression studies 
 mouse  xxxg1250xxx (genbank d50581;  inagaki  et al.  1995 a ;  sakura  et al.  1995 ) was coexpressed with rat  xxxg19xxx , sur1b, sur1bdelta33, sur1bt1 or sur1bt2. synthesis of capped mrna was carried out using the m m essage m m achine large scale  in vitro  transcription kit (ambion, austin, tx, usa).
             
 
  oocyte collection. 
 female  xenopus laevis  were anaesthetised with ms‐222 (2 g l −1  added to the water). one ovary was removed via a mini‐laparotomy, the incision sutured and the animal allowed to recover.  xenopus  were monitored during the recovery period from anaesthesia and checked post‐operatively for complications at regular intervals. once the wound had completely healed, the second ovary was removed in a similar operation and the animal was then killed by decapitation whilst under anaesthesia. immature stage v‐vi  xenopus  oocytes were incubated for 60 min with 1.0 mg ml −1  collagenase (type v, sigma) and manually defolliculated. oocytes were coinjected with ∼0.1 ng of mrna encoding  xxxg1250xxx  and ∼2 ng of mrna encoding sur (wild‐type or variant), giving a 1:20 ratio. the final injection volume was ∼50 nl oocyte −1 . control oocytes were injected with water. isolated oocytes were maintained in barth's solution and studied 1‐4 days after injection ( gribble  et al.  1997 a ).
                
 
 
  electrophysiology: two electrode voltage clamp. 
 whole‐cell currents were measured using a two electrode voltage clamp (geneclamp 500; axon instruments). voltages were applied and currents recorded using a microcomputer with an axolab interface and pclamp software (axon instruments). currents were filtered at 1 khz and digitised at 4 khz. current and voltage electrodes were filled with 3 m kcl and had resistances of 0.5‐2 momega. recordings were carried out at a holding potential of ‐10 mv in a high‐potassium extracellular solution containing (m m ): 90 kcl, 1 mgcl 2 , 1.8  xxxg2125xxx  2 , 5 hepes (ph 7.4 with koh).
                
 
 
  electrophysiology: excised patches. 
 patch pipettes were pulled from thick‐walled glass and had resistances of 250‐500 komega when filled with pipette solution. macroscopic currents were recorded from giant excised inside‐out patches at a holding potential of 0 mv and at 20‐24°c ( gribble  et al.  1997 a ). currents were evoked by repetitive 3 s voltage ramps from ‐110 to +100 mv and recorded using an epc7 patch‐clamp amplifier (heka electronik, lambrecht, germany). they were filtered at 5 khz and stored on digital audiotape. currents were subsequently filtered at 0.5 khz, digitised at 1 khz using a digidata 1200 interface and analysed using pclamp software. single‐channel currents were recorded from small inside‐out patches, filtered at 1 khz and sampled at 3 khz.
                
 the pipette (extracellular) solution contained (m m ): 140 kcl, 1.2 mgcl 2 , 2.6  xxxg2125xxx  2 , 10 hepes (ph 7.4 with koh). the standard intracellular (bath) solution contained (m m ): 107 kcl, 2 mgcl 2 , 1  xxxg2125xxx  2 , 10 egta, 10 hepes (ph 7.2 with koh; final [k + ]∼140 m m ) and nucleotides as indicated. mg 2+ ‐free solution contained (m m ): 107 kcl, 2.6  xxxg2125xxx  2 , 10 edta, 10 hepes (ph 7.2 with koh; final [k + ]∼140 m m ).  xxxd3394xxx  was made up as a 0.05 m stock solution in 0.1 m koh and  xxxd1868xxx  as a 0.02 m stock solution in 0.1 m koh. solutions containing nucleotides were made up fresh each day. the ph of all solutions was checked and readjusted, if required, after drug and nucleotide addition. rapid exchange of solutions was achieved by positioning the patch in the mouth of one of a series of adjacent inflow pipes placed in the bath.
                
 the slope conductance was measured by fitting a straight line to the current‐voltage relationship between ‐20 and ‐100 mv: the average of five consecutive ramps was calculated in each solution. 
 atp dose‐response relationships were obtained by alternating the control solution with a test atp concentration. the conductance ( g ) was then expressed as a fraction of the mean of the value obtained in the control solution before and after application of the nucleotide ( g c ). dose‐response curves were fitted to the hill equation:
                   (1) 
where [atp] is the atp concentration,  k i  is the concentration at which inhibition is half‐maximal and  h  is the slope factor (hill coefficient).
                
  xxxd3394xxx  dose‐response curves were fitted to the following equation ( gribble  et al.  1997 b ):
                   (2) 
where  x  is a term describing the high‐affinity site and  y  a term describing the low‐affinity site.
                   (3) 
and
                   (4) 
where [tolb] is the  xxxd3394xxx  concentration,  k i1  and  k i2  are the  xxxd3394xxx  concentrations at which inhibition is half‐maximal at the high‐ and low‐affinity sites, respectively,  h 1  and  h 2  are the hill icoefficients (slope factors) for the high‐ and low‐affinity sites, respectively, and  l  is the fractional conductance remaining when all of the high‐affinity inhibitory sites are occupied.
                
 data are given as means ± 1  s.e.m. , and the symbols in the figures indicate the mean and the vertical bars indicate 1  s.e.m.  (where this is larger than the symbol). statistical significance was tested using student's unpaired  t  test or anova, as appropriate.  p  values of < 0.05 were taken to indicate that the data were significantly different.

  molecular biology 
 we isolated mrna from the rat hypothalamus and constructed a rat hypothalamic cdna library (5 × 10 5  clones). this library was screened with probes for either the kir6. x  or sur x  family. only two kir6. x  clones were isolated, both of which were identified as  xxxg1250xxx . for sur, however, more than 40 positive clones were obtained. analysis of 24 of these clones revealed that 15 were similar to  xxxg19xxx  while 9 were identical to sur2b. all the clones homologous to  xxxg19xxx  differed from the rat  xxxg19xxx  sequence originally reported by five amino acids: these included four substitutions (t487s, p835q, g836r and g1313r) and the insertion of an additional serine residue after s741. in this paper we refer to this variant as sur1b for clarity. however, as we show that the functional properties of sur1b are identical to those of  xxxg19xxx , it thus does not constitute a true variant and should be referred to as  xxxg19xxx  elsewhere. the sequence of sur1b is identical to that deposited in genbank as accession no. x97279.
             
 one clone of the sur1b type had a 131 bp deletion before the second nucleotide‐binding domain (nbd2), but was otherwise identical to sur1b; because the missing 131 bp correspond to exon 33 of human  xxxg19xxx , we call this clone sur1bdelta33. as shown in  fig. 1 , this deletion introduced a frameshift at residue 1330, and the open reading frame stopped after a further 25 amino acids, truncating the protein at residue 1355. this resulted in the presence of 25 different residues and the deletion of the whole of nbd2.

 we generated  xxxg19xxx ‐specific pcr primers spanning exon 33 and used these for rt‐pcr of mouse midbrain, hypothalamus and heart tissue and of the insulin‐secreting beta‐cell line min6. in all cases, the major pcr product was wild‐type  xxxg19xxx  (655 bp) but a smaller pcr fragment of 525 bp was also identified ( fig. 2 ), indicating the presence of sur1delta33. the splice variant, however, was amplified in considerably lower abundance. the identity of the pcr products was confirmed by direct sequencing.

 we also carried out rt‐pcr with mrna from mouse hypothalamus using primers specific for  xxxg1250xxx , kir6.1,  xxxg19xxx  and sur2a/b. in these experiments ( n = 4 ), we routinely detected kir6.1,  xxxg1250xxx ,  xxxg19xxx  and sur2b, but we were unable to amplify sur2a (data not shown).
             
 
 
  electrophysiological analysis 
 to examine whether the functional properties of k atp  channels containing sur1b or sur1bdelta33 differ from  xenopus  oocytes. in all cases, no significant currethose containing  xxxg19xxx , we coexpressed the different sulphonylurea receptor variants with  xxxg1250xxx  innt was detected in the cell‐attached configuration but large currents developed following patch excision into nucleotide‐free solution. the mean current amplitude at ‐100 mv was 10.5 ± 1.8 na ( n = 19 ) for  xxxg1250xxx / xxxg19xxx , 7.1 ± 1.3 na ( n = 21 ) for  xxxg1250xxx /sur1b and 0.9 ± 0.2 na ( n = 25 ) for  xxxg1250xxx / sur1bdelta33. therefore, both sur1b and sur1bdelta33 were able to support the expression of full‐length  xxxg1250xxx , although  xxxg1250xxx /sur1bdelta33 was less effective than sur1b. thus nbd2 does not appear to be essential for the interaction of  xxxg19xxx  with  xxxg1250xxx  that enables its functional expression.
             
 
  atp sensitivity. 
 we next examined the effect of the different  xxxg19xxx  variants on the atp sensitivity of the channel ( fig. 3 ).  xxxg1250xxx /sur1b currents were blocked by atp with a  k i  of 22 ± 3 mu m  and a hill coefficient ( h ) of 1.30 ± 0.16 ( n = 6 ), values which are similar to those reported for  xxxg1250xxx / xxxg19xxx  channels ( gribble  et al.  1997 a ). however,  xxxg1250xxx /sur1bdelta33 currents were significantly less atp sensitive, with a  k i  of 86 ± 4 mu m  ( h = 1.20 ± 0.07;  n = 5 ).

 effects of atp on wild‐type and mutant k atp  channels 
 a , macroscopic currents recorded from inside‐out patches in response to a series of voltage ramps from ‐110 to +100 mv from oocytes injected with mrnas encoding  xxxg1250xxx  and either sur1b (left) or sur1bdelta33 (right). atp was added to the intracellular solution as indicated by the horizontal bars.  b , mean atp dose‐response relationships for  xxxg1250xxx /sur1b (•,  n = 6 ),  xxxg1250xxx /sur1bdelta33 (○,  n = 5 ),  xxxg1250xxx /sur1bt1 (▵,  n = 7 ) and  xxxg1250xxx /sur1bt2 (▴,  n = 8 ) currents. test solutions were alternated with control solutions and the slope conductance ( g ) is expressed as a fraction of the mean ( g c ) of that obtained in control solution before and after exposure to atp. the lines are the best fits of the data to the hill equation ( eqn (1) ) for sur1b (continuous line,  k i = 22 ± 3 mu m ,  h = 1.30 ± 0.16) and for sur1bdelta33 (dotted line,  k i = 86 ± 4 mu m ,  h = 1.20 ± 0.07). 
 
 
 
 
 in addition to lacking nbd2, sur1bdelta33 possesses an additional 25 amino acids at its c‐terminus. we explored the contribution of these amino acids to the difference in the functional properties of sur1bdelta33 and sur1b, by truncating sur1b at the start (residue 1330, sur1bt1) or at the end (residue 1374, sur1bt2) of exon 33. channels comprising  xxxg1250xxx  and either sur1bt1 or sur1bt2 expressed large currents in excised patches: 10 ± 2 na ( n = 16 ) and 1.8 ± 0.3 na ( n = 6 ), respectively. to our surprise, however, these channels had an atp sensitivity similar to that of  xxxg1250xxx /sur1b ( k i = 24 ± 4 mu m ,  h = 1.1 ± 0.2,  n = 7 , for sur1bt1; and  k i = 27 ± 3 mu m ,  h = 1.3 ± 0.1,  n = 8 , for sur1bt2). this suggests that the novel 25 amino acids produced by the frameshift, rather than the deletion of nbd2, are responsible for modifying the atp sensitivity of  xxxg1250xxx /sur1bdelta33.
                
 one mechanism by which a mutation may indirectly alter the atp sensitivity of the channel is by impairing the ability of the channel to close, because atp stabilises the closed state of the channel ( shyng  et al.  1997 a ;  trapp  et al.  1998 ). we therefore examined the properties of the single‐channel currents recorded from k atp  channels containing different  xxxg19xxx  variants, in the absence of nucleotide. it is evident from  fig. 4  that the open probability ( p o ) of  xxxg1250xxx /sur1bdelta33 channels was greater than that of either  xxxg1250xxx / xxxg19xxx  or  xxxg1250xxx /sur1b channels. the mean  p o  at ‐60 mv was 0.27 ± 0.05 ( n = 5 ) for  xxxg1250xxx / xxxg19xxx , 0.29 ± 0.05 ( n = 4 ) for  xxxg1250xxx /sur1b and 0.63 ± 0.05 ( n = 5 ) for  xxxg1250xxx /sur1bdelta33. this result suggests that the reduced atp sensitivity of sur1bdelta33 is a secondary consequence of the change in the channel kinetics. further support for this idea is provided by the fact that the  p o  of  xxxg1250xxx /sur1bt1 and  xxxg1250xxx /sur1bt2 channels was not markedly affected, being 0.35 ± 0.08 ( n = 4 ) and 0.29 ± 0.06 ( n = 4 ), respectively. the fact that truncation of sur1b at the end of exon 32 or 33 has only a small effect on  p o  further suggests that it is the presence of the additional 25 amino acids in sur1bdelta33 that is responsible for the higher  p o  of k atp  channels containing this variant.

 single‐channel currents

 the single‐channel current‐voltage relationship of  xxxg1250xxx / sur1bdelta33 currents showed slight inward rectification at potentials positive to +20 mv ( fig. 5 ), as is observed for  xxxg1250xxx / xxxg19xxx . the single‐channel conductance, measured between ‐20 and ‐80 mv, was 63 ± 1 ps ( n = 3 ) for  xxxg1250xxx /sur1bdelta33 channels, a value which is not significantly different from that observed for  xxxg1250xxx / xxxg19xxx  or for kir6.2deltac26, a truncated  xxxg1250xxx  expressed in the absence of sur x  (67‐76 ps;  sakura  et al.  1995 ;  tucker  et al.  1997 ).

  modulation by sur. 
 as is the case for  xxxg1250xxx / xxxg19xxx  channels, both mgadp and  xxxd1868xxx  were capable of enhancing the activity of  xxxg1250xxx /sur1b currents ( fig. 6 a  and  c ). by contrast,  xxxd1868xxx  did not activate  xxxg1250xxx /sur1bdelta33 currents and 100 mu m  mgadp was actually slightly inhibitory ( fig. 6 b  and  c ).  xxxd1868xxx  was tested in the presence of mgatp because its stimulatory action is dependent upon the presence of intracellular hydrolysable nucleotides ( kozlowski  et al.  1989 ). similar results were obtained for  xxxg1250xxx /sur1bt1 and  xxxg1250xxx /sur1bt2 currents ( fig. 6 c ). as discussed in more detail below, the inability of mgadp and  xxxd1868xxx  to stimulate k atp  channels containing sur1bdelta33, sur1bt1 or sur1bt2 is consistent with the fact that these sur variants lack nbd2. a reduced sensitivity to the inhibitory effect of adp (as observed for atp) may explain the fact that mgadp caused less inhibition of sur1bdelta33‐ than of sur1bt1‐ or sur1bt2‐containing channels. indeed,  xxxg1250xxx /sur1bdelta33 currents were blocked to the same extent in the presence and absence of mg 2+  (see  fig. 8 c ).

 we next compared the ability of sulphonylureas to block k atp  channels which contain different  xxxg19xxx  variants.  figure 7 a  shows that both  xxxd3394xxx  and  xxxd2215xxx  were significantly less effective at blocking  xxxg1250xxx / sur1bdelta33 than  xxxg1250xxx /sur1b currents. indeed, the effect of  xxxd2215xxx  was so slow that it was difficult to distinguish from rundown. the mean dose‐response relationships for  xxxd3394xxx  are given in  fig. 7 b  and, like that for  xxxg1250xxx / xxxg19xxx  ( gribble  et al.  1997 b ), were best fitted by assuming that the drug interacts with both a high‐affinity and a low‐affinity site ( eqn (2) ). the low‐affinity site lies on  xxxg1250xxx  ( gribble  et al.  1997 b ) and it is therefore not surprising that the  k i  for this site was independent of the  xxxg19xxx  variant, being 1.2 ± 0.6 m m  ( n = 4 ) and 1.4 ± 0.1 m m  ( n = 7 ) for  xxxg1250xxx /sur1b and  xxxg1250xxx / sur1bdelta33, respectively. the  k i  values for the high‐affinity site ‐ which lies on  xxxg19xxx  ‐ were also comparable: 2.1 ± 0.8 mu m  for  xxxg1250xxx /sur1b and 1.2 ± 0.4 mu m  for  xxxg1250xxx /sur1bdelta33. similar values of  k i  were also found for both the high‐ (2.0 mu m ) and low‐ (1.8 m m ) affinity sites of  xxxg1250xxx / xxxg19xxx  channels ( gribble  et al.  1997 b ). although the affinity for  xxxd3394xxx  was unaffected by deletion of nbd2, there was a marked difference in the ratio of high‐to low‐affinity inhibition. the percentage of  xxxd3394xxx  block attributable to the high‐affinity site was 57 % for  xxxg1250xxx / xxxg19xxx  ( gribble  et al.  1997 b ) and 72 ± 4 % ( n = 4 ) for  xxxg1250xxx /sur1b, but only 26 ± 6 % ( n = 7 ) for  xxxg1250xxx / sur1bdelta33.

 effect of sulphonylureas on  xxxg1250xxx /sur1b and  xxxg1250xxx /sur1bdelta33 currents

 the apparent sulphonylurea sensitivity of both cloned and native beta‐cell k atp  channels is enhanced by mgadp. it has been hypothesised that  xxxd3394xxx  prevents the stimulatory effect of mgadp (mediated by  xxxg19xxx ), thus unmasking its inhibitory effect on  xxxg1250xxx  ( gribble  et al.  1997 c ). the inhibitory effect of mgadp sums with that of  xxxd3394xxx  to enhance the apparent block by the drug. we investigated the effect of mgadp on the inhibitory effect of 100 mu m   xxxd3394xxx , a concentration that produces saturation of high‐affinity inhibition in both wild‐type and mutant channels ( fig. 7 ).  figure 8  shows that mgadp blocked, rather than activated,  xxxg1250xxx /sur1b channels in the presence of  xxxd3394xxx . the amount of inhibition produced by mgadp in the presence of  xxxd3394xxx  was comparable to that observed in the absence of mg 2+  (when adp acts solely as a blocker), thus supporting the idea that  xxxd3394xxx  prevents the stimulatory action of the magnesium nucleotide. we next explored the effect of mgadp in the presence of  xxxd3394xxx  on  xxxg1250xxx / sur1bdelta33 and  xxxg1250xxx /sur1bt1 channels, which are not activated by mgadp. as  fig. 8 c  shows, mgadp was an equally effective blocker of  xxxg1250xxx /sur1bt1 in the presence and absence of  xxxd3394xxx . in contrast, inhibition of  xxxg1250xxx /sur1bdelta33 currents by mgadp was greater in the presence of the drug ( p  < 0.01 ).
                
 the mg 2+  ion itself has been reported to enhance the efficacy of  xxxd3394xxx  block of native beta‐cell k atp  channels ( lee  et al.  1994 ). this was also the case for  xxxg1250xxx /sur1b, because removal of mg 2+  caused a significant reduction in the inhibitory effect of the drug. it also abolished the stimulatory effect of adp. in contrast,  xxxd3394xxx  block of both  xxxg1250xxx /sur1bdelta33 and  xxxg1250xxx /sur1bt1 channels was unaffected by mg 2+ . furthermore, in the absence of mg 2+ , the extent of  xxxd3394xxx  block of  xxxg1250xxx /sur1bt1 and  xxxg1250xxx /sur1b channels was barely significantly different. this raises the possibility that the ability of mg 2+  to enhance  xxxd3394xxx  inhibition involves nbd2 of  xxxg19xxx , or requires the functional integrity of both nbds (as is the case for mgadp;  gribble  et al.  1997 c ) or of the whole c‐terminus.
                
 
 
  whole‐cell studies. 
 to explore the effect of metabolic inhibition on  xxxg1250xxx / xxxg19xxx ,  xxxg1250xxx /sur1b,  xxxg1250xxx / sur1bdelta33 and  xxxg1250xxx /sur1bt1 channels, we recorded whole‐cell k atp  currents from intact oocytes and used 3 m m  azide as a metabolic poison. we also examined the effect of metabolic inhibition on kir6.2deltac26, expressed in the absence of a sulphonylurea receptor: this truncated form of  xxxg1250xxx  is able to express independently of sur ( tucker  et al.  1997 ). in control solution, oocytes expressing all five types of channel exhibited very small current amplitudes, similar to those of water‐injected oocytes. as shown in  fig. 9 , metabolic poisoning produced a large increase in  xxxg1250xxx / xxxg19xxx  and  xxxg1250xxx /sur1b currents but a very much smaller increase in  xxxg1250xxx /sur1bdelta33,  xxxg1250xxx /sur1bt1 and kir6.2deltac26 currents. nevertheless, it is clear from the inset to  fig. 9  that  xxxg1250xxx /sur1bdelta33 currents were activated about 5‐fold and that the activated current could be inhibited by  xxxd3394xxx  and  xxxd2215xxx , indicating that it flows through k atp  channels. likewise, azide induced ∼4‐fold activation of kir6.2deltac26 currents and 3‐fold activation of  xxxg1250xxx /sur1bt1 currents. it is also noteworthy that, in contrast to what was observed for excised patches, both  xxxd3394xxx  and  xxxd2215xxx  blocked  xxxg1250xxx /sur1bdelta33 currents in intact oocytes almost completely ( fig. 9 ).

 there are two possible reasons for the smaller currents evoked by metabolic inhibition in oocytes expressing  xxxg1250xxx /sur1bdelta33,  xxxg1250xxx /sur1bt1 and kir6.2deltac26: either the number of k atp  channels present in the plasma membrane is less than that found for the wild‐type channel, or a similar number of k atp  channels are present but they are less sensitive to metabolic inhibition. an indication of the level of functional channel expression can be obtained from the amplitude of the macroscopic current recorded in excised patches.  figure 10  therefore shows a comparison of the amplitude of the current at ‐100 mv activated by metabolic inhibition in the intact oocyte with that observed in the inside‐out patch. in each case, we have expressed the current as a fraction of that recorded for  xxxg1250xxx / xxxg19xxx . it is evident that  xxxg1250xxx /sur1bdelta33 and kir6.2deltac26 expressed much smaller currents than  xxxg1250xxx / xxxg19xxx , in both whole‐cell and excised patch configurations. nevertheless, the relative amount of current in the two configurations was similar, suggesting that the smaller currents evoked by metabolic inhibition are at least partly due to a reduced level of functional channel expression. the lower activation of  xxxg1250xxx /sur1bt1 currents on metabolic poisoning, however, cannot be attributed to a reduced level of expression, because this channel exhibited large currents in excised patches, with amplitudes comparable to those observed for  xxxg1250xxx /sur1b. moreover, there was a profound difference in the relative amount of current observed in the whole‐cell and excised patch configurations for this variant. this variant, therefore, appears to exhibit a marked reduction in the sensitivity of the channel to metabolic inhibition.

  discussion 
 the results of our cdna library screening and rt‐pcr experiments demonstrate that  xxxg1250xxx ,  xxxg19xxx  and sur2b are expressed in the rodent hypothalamus. thus it can be expected that both  xxxg1250xxx / xxxg19xxx  and  xxxg1250xxx /sur2b channels exist in this region of the brain. similar findings have been reported for the substantia nigra ( liss  et al.  1999 ). in contrast, in an earlier single‐cell pcr study of rat vmh neurones only  xxxg19xxx  and kir6.1 were detected ( lee  et al.  1999 ). the sequence of  xxxg19xxx  we identified differed from the original sequence by five amino acids. however, when sur1b was coexpressed with  xxxg1250xxx , the properties of the k atp  currents were not different from those of  xxxg1250xxx / xxxg19xxx  channels. thus, these five amino acids are probably simply polymorphisms and in future sur1b should be referred to as  xxxg19xxx .
          
 we also detected a novel variant of  xxxg19xxx , sur1bdelta33, which was expressed at low levels in hypothalamus, midbrain, heart and the insulin‐secreting beta‐cell line min6. this variant would not have been distinguished by the primers used by  lee  et al.  (1999) , because its sequence is identical to that of  xxxg19xxx  in the amplified region. several of the properties of the channels formed by coexpression of  xxxg1250xxx  and sur1bdelta33 resemble those of kir6.2deltac26 expressed in the absence of the sulphonylurea receptor. this raises the question of whether sur1bdelta33 facilitates the surface expression of full‐length  xxxg1250xxx , but is unable to modify its functional properties fully. we believe this is unlikely for several reasons. firstly, the  p o  of  xxxg1250xxx  is lower in the absence of  xxxg19xxx  than in its presence ( proks & ashcroft, 1997 ;  trapp  et al.  1998 ;  john  et al.  1998 ;  mikhailov  et al.  1998 ), whereas the  p o  of  xxxg1250xxx / sur1bdelta33 is substantially higher than that of kir6.2deltac26. secondly, the  xxxd3394xxx  dose‐response curve for  xxxg1250xxx / sur1bdelta33 is best fitted assuming a two‐site model, rather than the one‐site model as for kir6.2deltac26 ( gribble  et al.  1997 b ). thirdly, a  k i  of 86 mu m  for atp inhibition would not be expected for kir6.2deltac26 if the  p o  were as high as that observed for  xxxg1250xxx /sur1bdelta33 ( trapp  et al.  1998 ). at a  p o  of 0.63, a  k i  in the millimolar range is predicted. thus it appears that sur1bdelta33 is capable of functionally coupling to  xxxg1250xxx .
          
 we did not detect sur2a, either by rt‐pcr or by cdna library screening, which suggests that this subunit is not expressed to any marked extent in the hypothalamus. we detected kir6.1 by rt‐pcr of mouse hypothalamic mrna, but not by screening a rat hypothalamic cdna library. it seems unlikely that this is a species difference, but is rather a result of the greater sensitivity of the rt‐pcr method. 
 
  atp sensitivity 
 the atp sensitivity of  xxxg1250xxx /sur1bdelta33 channels is approximately 4‐fold lower than that of  xxxg1250xxx / xxxg19xxx  channels. one might expect the atp sensitivity of  xxxg1250xxx /sur1bdelta33 channels to be higher than that of wild‐type k atp  channels, since mutations within the walker a and walker b motifs of nbd2 enhance channel inhibition by atp ( gribble  et al.  1997 c , 1998 ). this is because mgatp (like mgadp) enhances k atp  channel activity by interaction with the nbds of  xxxg19xxx , and thereby produces an apparent reduction in atp sensitivity ( gribble  et al.  1998 ). one possible reason for the paradoxical reduction in atp sensitivity of  xxxg1250xxx /sur1bdelta33 is that the loss of nbd2 might prevent the ability of  xxxg19xxx  to ‘sensitise’  xxxg1250xxx  to atp.  tucker  et al.  (1997)  have shown that when a truncated form of  xxxg1250xxx  is expressed by itself the  k i  for atp inhibition is ∼100 mu m , but that this is shifted to 10‐30 mu m  in the presence of  xxxg19xxx . this idea seems unlikely, however, because  xxxg1250xxx /sur1bt1 and  xxxg1250xxx / sur1bt2 channels lack nbd2 yet exhibit normal atp sensitivity. an alternative explanation for the reduced atp sensitivity of  xxxg1250xxx /sur1bdelta33 channels is that it results from the higher channel open probability. this idea is supported by the fact that mutations within  xxxg1250xxx  which enhance  p o  produce a concomitant reduction in atp sensitivity ( shyng  et al.  1997 a ;  trapp  et al.  1998 ). furthermore, the open probabilities of  xxxg1250xxx /sur1bt1 and  xxxg1250xxx /sur1bt2, like their atp sensitivity, are similar to that of  xxxg1250xxx /sur1b channels.
             
 
 
   xxxd3394xxx  sensitivity 
 in excised patches,  xxxg1250xxx /sur1bdelta33 channels exhibit a lower  xxxd3394xxx  sensitivity than wild‐type k atp  channels. our results suggest that this effect is not a consequence of a reduced binding affinity for the drug, since the  k i  for  xxxd3394xxx  block is unaffected and  xxxg1250xxx /sur1bdelta33 channels exhibit a normal  xxxd3394xxx  sensitivity in intact oocytes. rather, they suggest that the reduced drug sensitivity results because the transduction of  xxxd3394xxx  binding to sur1bdelta33 into channel closure is impaired. this is suggested by the fact that the fraction of block associated with the high‐affinity site is lower for  xxxg1250xxx /sur1bdelta33 channels than for  xxxg1250xxx /sur1b channels. there are at least three possible explanations for this finding. firstly, residues within the c‐terminus of  xxxg19xxx , not present in sur1bdelta33, may be directly involved in coupling sur to  xxxg1250xxx . secondly, the reduced drug potency may be a consequence of the higher  p o  of  xxxg1250xxx /sur1bdelta33 channels, if  xxxd3394xxx  stabilises the long closed state ( gillis  et al.  1989 ). indeed, we have shown elsewhere that an increased  p o , resulting from a mutation in  xxxg1250xxx , is associated with a reduced block by  xxxd3394xxx  ( trapp  et al.  1998 ). thirdly, the fact that mg 2+  is unable to enhance  xxxd3394xxx  block of  xxxg1250xxx /sur1bdelta33 currents may contribute to the lower efficacy of the drug. the first explanation is unlikely because  xxxd3394xxx  blocks wild‐type,  xxxg1250xxx /sur1bdelta33 and  xxxg1250xxx /sur1bt1 channels to a similar extent in the absence of mg 2+ . the fact that  xxxg1250xxx /sur1bt1 and  xxxg1250xxx /sur1bdelta33 differ in their open probabilities supports the second possibility. the third explanation may also play a contributory role.
             
 as is the case for native vmh k atp  channels, the sulphonylurea sensitivity of  xxxg1250xxx /sur1bdelta33 channels varies markedly between the intact cell and the excised patch.  xxxd2215xxx , for example, produces no clear inhibition in the excised patch, yet causes complete block of the whole‐cell current. a possible explanation for this difference is afforded by the fact that the ability of sulphonylureas to inhibit both the wild‐type and  xxxg1250xxx /sur1bdelta33 channel is enhanced by intracellular mgadp. in intact cells, magnesium nucleotides are likely to be present and will therefore contribute to the enhanced block by sulphonylureas. indeed, both  xxxg1250xxx /sur1b and  xxxg1250xxx /sur1bdelta33 channels show greater inhibition by  xxxd3394xxx  in intact cells than in excised patches (as is also the case for  xxxg1250xxx / xxxg19xxx  channels; compare  sakura  et al.  1995  with  gribble  et al.  1997 b ).
             
 it is noteworthy that the inhibitory effect of mgadp on  xxxg1250xxx /sur1bdelta33 channels in the presence of  xxxd3394xxx  is greater than that observed for adp in either the presence or the absence of mg 2+ . this would not be expected if our hypothesis that  xxxd3394xxx  abolishes the stimulatory effect of mgadp on wild‐type channels is correct: rather, there should be no difference in the extent of block. the most likely explanation for this result is that the reduction in  p o  produced by  xxxd3394xxx  leads to an enhanced sensitivity of  xxxg1250xxx  to nucleotide block. the fact that  xxxg1250xxx /sur1bt1 channels, which have a  p o  close to wild‐type, are blocked to a similar extent by adp in the absence and presence of  xxxd3394xxx  supports this view. because the relationship between  p o  and nucleotides is exponential ( shyng  et al.  1997 a ), adp inhibition of  xxxg1250xxx /sur1b and  xxxg1250xxx /sur1bt1 channels (which have a lower intrinsic  p o ) is unaffected by  xxxd3394xxx .
             
 
 
  metabolic activation 
 in contrast to  xxxg1250xxx / xxxg19xxx  and  xxxg1250xxx /sur1b,  xxxg1250xxx /sur1bdelta33 and  xxxg1250xxx /sur1bt1 channels show only a small activation by metabolic inhibition when expressed in  xenopus  oocytes. because  xxxg1250xxx /sur1bt1 shows substantial currents in excised patches, it appears that the metabolic sensitivity of this channel is reduced. thus, deletion of nbd2 prevents channel activation by metabolic inhibition, consistent with previous studies in which nbd2 mutations that prevent magnesium nucleotide activation also abolished the ability of metabolic block to stimulate channel activity ( nichols  et al.  1996 ;  shyng  et al.  1997 b , 1998 ).
             
 current amplitudes observed in inside‐out patches were much smaller for  xxxg1250xxx /sur1bdelta33 than for  xxxg1250xxx /sur1b. this suggests that the inability of metabolic inhibition to activate large  xxxg1250xxx /sur1bdelta33 currents in intact oocytes is primarily due to a reduced level of surface expression. in contrast to  xxxg1250xxx /sur1bt1, however, azide induced an ∼5‐fold activation of  xxxg1250xxx /sur1bdelta33. a similar increase was found for kir6.2deltac26 expressed in the absence of sur. this cannot reflect magnesium nucleotide stimulation (mediated by sur) of channel activity by metabolic inhibition, as this is not observed for either of these channels. we therefore speculate that it may be a consequence of a fall in intracellular atp induced by azide, which is sensed by the  xxxg1250xxx  subunit. this is more evident for  xxxg1250xxx /sur1bdelta33 (and kir6.2deltac26), than for  xxxg1250xxx /sur1bt1, because both the former two channels have a lower atp sensitivity. it seems likely, however, that activation of  xxxg1250xxx /sur1bt1 channels would also occur, were atp levels to fall further. 
 
 
  is sur1bdelta33 part of the vmh k atp  channel?
             
 many of the properties of the rat vmh k atp  channel differ from those of the archetypal k atp  channel. compared with  xxxg1250xxx / xxxg19xxx , the vmh channel has a reduced atp sensitivity ( k i , 1‐3 m m ) and a different single‐channel conductance (46 or 140 ps); it is also not activated by k +  channel openers, and is blocked by  xxxd3394xxx  in intact cells but not in excised patches. because the single‐channel conductance and atp inhibition of archetypal k atp  channels are intrinsic to  xxxg1250xxx , while the sulphonylurea and k +  channel opener sensitivities are conferred by sur, these results suggest that both the pore‐forming and regulatory subunits of the vmh k atp  channel may differ from those of archetypal k atp  channels.
             
 channels formed by coexpression of sur1bdelta33 with  xxxg1250xxx  share many properties with those of the native k atp  channel of vmh neurones. in particular, the cloned channels are not activated by  xxxd1868xxx  or mgadp, and are blocked less by  xxxd3394xxx  in excised patches than in intact oocytes. it is therefore possible that the clone we have isolated may encode the sur subunit of the vmh k atp  channel. one argument against this idea is the fact that only a single sur1bdelta33 clone was detected in the hypothalamic cdna library, compared with 14 sur1b clones. this suggests that the expression level of sur1bdelta33 in the hypothalamus is low. furthermore, sur1bdelta33 is also expressed at similarly low levels in midbrain, heart and the beta‐cell line min6, which possess classical k atp  channels. in addition,  xxxg19xxx  mrna has been identified in individual vmh neurones by single‐cell pcr ( lee  et al.  1999 ). nevertheless, it remains possible that sur1bdelta33, but not sur1b, is present in a specific neuronal population within the hypothalamus. a careful analysis of the mrnas present in the vmh glucose‐sensing neurones by single‐cell pcr is needed, therefore, to confirm whether or not sur1bdelta33 does indeed constitute the sur subunit of vmh neurones.
             
 identification of the pore‐forming subunit of the k atp  channel from vmh neurones is complicated by the fact that single‐channel conductances of 46 and ∼150 ps have been reported for rat ( ashford  et al.  1990 a ;  routh  et al.  1997 )and 70 ps for mouse ( rowe  et al.  1998 ). the latter value is close to that found for  xxxg1250xxx  ( sakura  et al.  1995 ;  tucker  et al.  1997 ), but the former values suggest that a different protein is involved. the reduced atp sensitivity of the vmh k atp  channel also supports this idea.
             
 
 
  functional consequences of c‐terminal deletions of  xxxg19xxx  
 the results presented in this paper indicate that the c‐terminus of  xxxg19xxx  influences k atp  channel gating, that it plays an important role in the regulation of k atp  channel activity by nucleotides and drugs, and that it is not needed for functional channel expression.
             
 previous studies have shown that truncation of up to 49 amino acids from the c‐terminus of  xxxg19xxx  prevents the cell surface expression of  xxxg19xxx , as measured by luminometry using  c‐myc ‐labelled protein ( sharma  et al.  1999 ). these authors also suggest that truncation of 221 amino acids prevents cell surface expression of  xxxg19xxx , based on the fact that the protein is not glycosylated. we observed, however, that truncation of 253 amino acids (sur1bt1) did not affect the magnitude of the macroscopic currents observed in excised patches, and that truncation of 210 amino acids (sur1bt2) produced macroscopic current with a magnitude about 20 % of that observed for wild‐type sur1b, when coexpressed with  xxxg1250xxx . this indicates that c‐terminal truncations of  xxxg19xxx  do not necessarily prevent cell surface expression of the k atp  channel.
             
 persistent hyperinsulinaemic hypoglycaemia of infancy (phhi) results from mutations in  xxxg19xxx  (usually) or  xxxg1250xxx  (rarely) that lead to the loss of functional k atp  channels in the beta‐cell membrane and thus to continuous insulin secretion even at very low blood glucose concentrations ( aguilar‐bryan & bryan, 1999 ). phhi mutations within  xxxg19xxx  either prevent surface expression of the k atp  channel, or abolish the ability of mgadp to cause channel activation. in both cases, this leads to a loss of k atp  channel activity in response to metabolic inhibition. it is interesting that a splice site mutation within intron 32, which causes premature protein truncation, produces phhi ( thomas  et al.  1995 ). this truncation is very similar to that found when exon 33 is deleted: it contains an additional 27 novel amino acids, rather than 25 novel residues, although the sequence is different. it would be interesting to know whether the intron 32 mutation is able to produce small k atp  currents in excised patches exposed to nucleotide‐free solution (when coexpressed with  xxxg1250xxx ), as is found for the exon 33 deletion. and, in addition, whether any such currents show a response to metabolic inhibition similar to that of sur1bdelta33 or whether, like sur1bt1, they are not activated by metabolic inhibition.
