abstract
in normal prostate, keratinocyte growth factor (kgf), also known as fibroblast growth factor-7 ( xxxd2829xxx ) serves as a paracrine growth factor
synthesized in stromal cells that acts on epithelial cells through its receptor,  xxxg792xxx . kgf and  xxxg792xxx  were found in human cancer epithelial
cells as well as stromal cells. since kgf expressed in epithelial cells of benign prostatic hyperplasia (bph) and in prostate cancer, it has been
suggested that kgf might act as an autocrine factor in bph and prostate cancer. to investigate the roles of kgf in cancerous stroma, primary
cultured human prostate cancer stromal cells (pcscs) were isolated and evaluated. these pcscs possessed estrogen receptors and  xxxg792xxx ,
but not  xxxg183xxx  as determined by rt-pcr and western blot, respectively. kgf exhibited mitogenic and anti-apoptotic effects that
correlated with induction of cyclin-d1, bcl-2,  xxxg251xxx  and phospho-akt expression in pcscs, where treatment with kgf antiserum abolished
cell proliferation and anti-apoptotic protein expression. pcscs exposed to kgf for various time periods resulted in phosphorylation of akt
and subsequent up-regulation of bcl-2. kgf modulated dynamic protein expression indicated that kgf triggered cell cycle machinery and
then activated anti-apoptotic actions in pcscs. cell proliferation analysis indicated that tamoxifen or  xxxd2165xxx ,780 reduced cell viability
in a dose-dependent manner; however, kgf prevented this inhibition, which further demonstrated kgf triggered anti-apoptotic machinery
through activating bcl-2 and phospho-akt expression. in summary, kgf has an autocrine effect and serves as a survival factor in primary
cultured human prostate cancer stromal cells.

1. introduction
cancer is a major public health problem in the united
states and other developed countries which is responsible
for one in four deaths in the usa [1]. prostate cancer is the
most diagnosed malignancy in men and the second leading
cause of cancer deaths in men [1]. prostate development is
dependent on both epithelial–stromal interactions and androgen, whose effects are mediated via  xxxg183xxx  (ar).
most prostate cancers are initially sensitive to androgen ablation by surgical or medical removal of androgenic hormones

or administration of non-steroidal anti-androgens; however,
tumors eventually developed to androgen independence [2].
one potential mechanism for androgen-independent cell
growth is activation of the  xxxg183xxx  pathway by
growth factors [2].
peptide growth factors are important as paracrine agents in
mediating bidirectional stromal–epithelial interactions. keratinocyte growth factor (kgf) was originally identified as
a unique member of the fgf family [3]. kgf is synthesized and secreted by stromal cells and acts on epithelial
cells specifically through a high-affinity receptor for kgf
( xxxg792xxx ) [3–5]. therefore, kgf is considered to be a unidirectional paracrine effector that regulates normal epithelial
cell proliferation [4].  xxxg792xxx  later was cloned and shown to

y.-w. huang et al. / journal of steroid biochemistry & molecular biology 100 (2006) 24–33

be an alternatively spliced iiib variant of the fgf receptor
(fgfr)-2/bek gene [5]. kgf is expressed in a variety of tissues
including lung, prostate, uterus, mammary gland, digestive
tract, bladder and skin [6,7]. moreover, kgf is known to
have diverse effects, such as inhibition of apoptosis [8–10]
and regulation of cell differentiation [11,12]. kgf and  xxxg792xxx 
expression have been found in human breast cancer epithelial cells as well as in stromal cells [13]. kgf expression was
closely associated with the expression of  xxxg730xxx 
alpha (er-␣) and the co-expression of kgf and  xxxg792xxx  significantly correlated with lower apoptotic index, but not with
proliferative activity [13].
our laboratory first cloned the mrna encoding kgf
from canine prostate and produced recombinant canine kgf
which specifically acted on cultured canine prostatic epithelial cells [14]. we also determined that kgf was expressed
in normal prostate tissues of both mature and young dogs.
in vitro, the recombinant canine kgf had potent mitogenic
activity on canine prostate epithelial cells, whereas it has no
effect on canine prostate stromal cells [14]. kgf could affect
aromatase activity in mature canine prostate epithelial cells,
suggesting that kgf may be involved indirectly in the etiology of prostate cancer by increasing aromatase activity,
thereby increasing aromatization of androgens to estrogens
[15]. kgf expression was detected in cultured stromal cells
of the normal prostate but not in epithelial cells and kgf
was also found to be localized in fibroblasts and smooth muscle cells in normal, benign prostatic hyperplasia (bph) and
prostate cancer [16]. therefore, kgf expression in epithelial
cells of bph and prostate cancer suggests that kgf might
act as an autocrine factor in bph and prostate cancer [16].
in present study, we hypothesize kgf may have autocrine
activities in cancerous stroma. to elucidate the roles of kgf
in the regulation of stroma, primary cultured human prostate
cancer stromal cells (pcscs) were isolated and used to investigate cellular responses to kgf. our results demonstrated
pcscs expressed er-␣, er-␤ and  xxxg792xxx , but not ar. furthermore, kgf could stimulate pcscs proliferation in doseand time-dependent fashions that correlated with the upregulation cyclin-d1, anti-apoptotic bcl-2 and phospho-akt.
anti-estrogens, including tamoxifen and  xxxd2165xxx ,780, inhibited cell viability of pcscs in a dose-dependent manner and
kgf could abrogate this inhibition which might also correlate with er-␣, bcl-2 and phospho-akt up-regulation. these
findings indicated that kgf had an autocrine action on the
cultured pcscs and kgf could serve as an anti-apoptotic
factor to eliminate anti-estrogens effects.

2. materials and methods
2.1. cells and reagents
human prostate cancer tissues were obtained through
the tissue procurement shared resource at the ohio state
university hospitals. protocols for tissue dissociation and

25

primary prostate cancer stromal cells isolation were modified and described previously [17]. the isolated human
prostate cancer stromal cells were plated and maintained
in t75 flasks in a mixture of dulbecco’s modified eagle’s
medium and ham’s f12 medium (dmem/f12 at 1:1)
without phenol red (atlanta biologicals, norcross, ga,
usa) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (fbs)
and antibiotic–antimycotic (100 u/ml  xxxd2871xxx  sodium,
100 ␮g/ml streptomycin sulfate and 0.25 ␮g/ml amphotericin
b) (invitrogen, carlsbad, ca, usa) at 37 ◦ c in 5% co2
incubation. mcf-7, du-145, pc-3 and 22rv1 cells were
obtained from american type culture collection (atcc,
manassas, va, usa) and maintained in dmem/f12 medium
with 5% fbs.
antibodies against phospho-akt at ser 473 (p473 -akt),
akt, bcl-2,  xxxg251xxx , cyclin-d1, er-␣ were purchased from
cell signaling technology inc. (beverly, ma, usa). antibodies against er-␤, ar,  xxxg792xxx  (bek) and ␤-actin were
obtained from santa cruz biotechnology inc. (santa cruz,
ca, usa). goat anti-rabbit and goat anti-mouse horseradish
peroxidase (hrp)-conjugated antibodies were procured from
amersham biosciences (piscataway, nj, usa). recombinant human kgf was from peprotech inc. (rocky hill, nj,
usa). antibodies against kgf were from r&d systems
(minneapolis, mn, usa).
2.2. immunocytochemistry
immunocytochemistry was used to determine the purity
of the isolated primary cultured human prostate stromal
cells. pcscs were cultured on slides (nunc inc., naperville,
il, usa) and immunostained as described previously [17].
briefly, after −20 ◦ c methanol fixation for 5 min, cells were
stained for multi-cytokeratin (4/5/6/8/10/13/18) or vimentin
(vector laboratories, burlingame, ca, usa) using the
vectastain® universal quick kit and dab substrate kit (vector
laboratories) following the manufacturer’s instructions. the
optimal primary antibody dilution was 1:10 and 1:100 for
multi-cytokeratin and vimentin, respectively. the immunostained cells were examined under a light microscope.
2.3. cell viability assay (mts/pms methods)
the effect of kgf, tamoxifen or  xxxd2165xxx ,780 (ici)
on cell viability was assessed by celltiter 96® aqueous solution (promega, madison, wi, usa) assay in 96well plates according to the manufacturer’s instructions. a
total of 4000 cells/well was seeded and cultured in sextuple wells in phenol red-free dmem/f12 medium supplemented with 10% fbs overnight. the medium was
switched to dmem/f12 supplemented with dextran-coated
charcoal (dcc) (dextran t-70, pharmacia; activated charcoal, sigma)-stripped fbs (5%) for 48 h. to evaluate the
effects of kgf, tamoxifen or ici treatment on cell viability,
cells were treated with presence or absence of kgf, tamoxifen or ici in fresh medium containing 0.02% of bsa for

26

various time intervals. at the end of treatment, cell viability was measured by adding 20 ␮l of freshly combined mts
(promega) and phenazine methosulfate (pms) (the ratio of
mts:pms at 20:1) solution to each well. then, the plates
were incubated for 30 min and the color density was measured as the optical density at 490 nm (od 490 nm) using
an elisa microplate reader (molecular devices, sunnyvale,
ca, usa).
2.4. rna isolation and reverse
transcription-polymerase chain reaction (rt-pcr)
the  xxxg792xxx  mrna expression in pcscs, pc-3 and du145 cells was examined by rt-pcr. a total of approximately
105 viable cells was plated in each of six-well plates with 2 ml
of culture medium and total rna was isolated using 1 ml
trizol® reagent (invitrogen) according to manufacturer’s
instructions. rt-pcr was performed as described previously
[17]. the primer sequences generating 273 bp pcr products
for  xxxg792xxx  were 5 -caa tgc aga agt gct ggc tct
gtt caa-3 (sense) and 5 -ctg aag tct ggc ttc ttg
g-3 (antisense). for the pcr, 35 cycles of amplification
were performed with each cycle consisting of annealing temperature at 60 ◦ c and mgcl2 concentration at 3.5 mm. the
final pcr products (10 ␮l) were mixed with 1 ␮l of 10×
loading buffer and separated on a 1.5% agarose gel. the
mrna expression was measured by densitometry of ethidium bromide-stained pcr products under uv light.
2.5. western blot analysis
after incubation with the indicated concentrations of
kgf, tamoxifen and/or ici, primary cultured human pcscs
were washed with ice-cold pbs and then lysed in m-per
mammalian protein extraction reagent (pierce, rockford,
il, usa) with protease inhibitor (pierce) on ice. after cell
lysates were centrifuged, the suspensions were assayed for
protein content using the bca protein assay kit (pierce).
equal amounts of proteins were boiled with sample loading
buffer (62.5 mm tris–hcl, ph 6.8, 25% glycerol, 2% sds,
0.004% bromophenol blue and 5% ␤- xxxd26xxx ) for
5 min and resolved onto a 10% sds-page. after electrophoresis, proteins were transferred to a polyvinylidene
difluoride (pvdf) membrane (millipore) using a semidry transfer system (bio-rad, hercules, ca, usa). the
transblotted membrane was washed twice with phosphatebuffered saline (pbs) containing 0.1% tween-20 (pbst)
and blocked with pbst containing 5% skim milk for 1 h.
then, the membrane was incubated with the primary antibody at 4 ◦ c overnight. all primary antibodies were diluted
1:1000 in 5% skim milk containing pbst. after incubation
with a primary antibody, the membrane was briefly rinsed
and washed twice with pbst for a total of 20 min, followed
by incubation in a secondary antibody, either goat anti-rabbit
or anti-mouse igg-conjugated with hrp (diluted 1:5000) for
1 h at room temperature. following incubation, the membrane

was rinsed and washed twice with pbst. immunoblots were
enhanced by ecl plustm reagent (amersham biosciences)
and visualized using the fujifilm imaging system (fujifilm
medical systems, stamford, ct, usa). the immunostained
bands were quantified using multigauge software (fujifilm).
2.6. statistical analysis
the results of the cell viability assay were presented
as the mean ± standard deviation (s.d.). statistical analysis was performed using statview® anova unpaired t-test.
p-values of less than 0.05 were considered to be statistically
significant.
3. results
3.1. characteristics of primary cultured human prostate
cancer stromal cells
the purity of human pcscs preparations was indicated by
morphology and confirmed by immunohistochemistry. stromal cells were distinguished from epithelial cells based not
only on their characteristic morphology but also their specific
gene expression, which was confirmed by light microscopy
and immunocytochemical staining. typically, stromal cells
exhibited typical spindle-shaped morphology (fig. 1a),
while epithelial cells tended to grow in rounded shapes.
immunocytochemical staining revealed that the majority of
stromal cells (>95%) were immunopositive for the presence
of vimentin and no expression of cytokeratin was detected
(fig. 1a), which confirmed the fibroblastic nature of the stromal cells.
to confirm the presence of kgf receptor on pcscs, we
examined  xxxg792xxx  expression at both mrna and protein levels
by rt-pcr and western blot analyses, respectively. our data
indicated that the cultured pcscs expressed  xxxg792xxx  mrna
although the levels of expression were lower than those of the
human prostate cancer cell lines, du-145 and pc-3 (fig. 1b).
we also showed  xxxg792xxx  protein in pcscs at a level lower than
that of the human breast cancer cells, mcf-7 (fig. 1b). the
above findings show pcscs express  xxxg792xxx  and its level is
lower than those of human cancer epithelial cell lines.
to address steroid receptors in pcscs, er-␣, er-␤ and
ar protein levels were measured by western blot analysis.
results indicated that pcscs expressed both er-␣ and er␤, but not ar (fig. 1b). at the same time, mcf-7 cells (a
human breast cancer cell line) were used as er-␣- and er␤-positive cells, and 22rv1 cells, a human prostate cancer
cell line were used as ar-positive cells (fig. 1).
3.2. kgf stimulated proliferation of pcscs
kgf has a mitogenic effect on normal and cancer epithelial cells. to assess the mitotic effect of kgf on pcscs,
the cells were starved of steroid hormones in 5% dcc–fbs
containing medium for 48 h and then exposed to 0–50 ng/ml

of kgf for another 48 or 96 h in medium containing 0.02%
bsa. our results showed that kgf stimulated proliferation
of pcscs in both time- and dose-dependent manners. at
50 ng/ml of kgf treatment, cell proliferation of pcscs was
significantly increased by about 10% compared with vehicle
only at both 48 and 96 h (fig. 2a). antiserum of kgf was
used to evaluate the effect of kgf on cell proliferation of
pcscs. while kgf stimulated cell proliferation, anti-kgf
antibodies significantly reduced cell proliferation on pcscs
(fig. 2b). the anti-proliferative effect was not observed with
the co-treatment of kgf and its antibodies, indicating an
autocrine activity of kgf. we also found that there were no
different results between two kgf antibodies.
to characterize the mitotic effect of kgf on pcscs, western blot was performed to measure protein expression. it was
observed that as low as 1 ng/ml of kgf induced more than
one-half-fold of cyclin-d1 protein and at 50 ng/ml treatment
this level went up more than two-fold (fig. 2c). in pcscs,
induction of anti-apoptotic bcl-2 and  xxxg251xxx , phospho-akt
proteins were also observed in response to kgf treatment
(fig. 2c). in contrast, kgf treatment did not change the
expression of akt protein and ␤-actin as loading control. in
fig. 2d, we also showed a significant increase in cyclin-d1,
bcl-2,  xxxg251xxx  and akt phosphorylation in pcscs by 48 h
following dosing of the cells with kgf (10 ng/ml) which
was similar to results shown in fig. 2c. these significant
increases in cyclin-d1, bcl-2,  xxxg251xxx  and akt phosphorylation were blocked by co-treatment of the cells with anti-kgf
antibodies (fig. 2d). however, co-treatment of the cells with
kgf and its antibodies did not affect akt expression. these
observations indicated that kgf stimulated proliferation of
pcscs that correlated with or was mediated through an

increase in expression of the cell cycle regulator, cyclin-d1.
in addition, kgf treatment augmented expression of antiapoptotic, bcl-2,  xxxg251xxx  and phospho-akt proteins.
3.3. kgf-regulated dynamic protein expressions in
pcscs
in order to elucidate the molecular mechanisms of kgf on
cell proliferation, a serial western blot assay was performed
to trace the effect of kgf treatment on protein expression.
fig. 3 shows the profiles of the proteins of interest in pcscs
after exposure to kgf  xxxd1891xxx  ng/ml for various time intervals.
our data demonstrated that kgf treatment induced phosphoakt expression after 3 h treatment with peak expression of
phospho-akt at 48 h followed by decreased expression over
time (fig. 3). in contrast, total akt expression levels were
unchanged during treatment.
kgf treatment up-regulated er-␣ expression initially,
although the effect was transient and followed by a decrease
in er-␤ expression after 1 h exposure to kgf. in addition, cyclin-d1 expression was decreased after 3 h, but was
increased again 48 h later. in contrast, bcl-2 expression
increased in a time-dependent fashion, which was more significant after 48 h treatment. kgf affected  xxxg792xxx  expression
with a pattern similar to bcl-2. taken together, these results
indicated that kgf stimulated cell proliferation via triggering of the cell cycle machinery and up-regulating cyclin-d1
expression. moreover, the effect of kgf might involve  xxxg730xxx  signaling by stimulating er-␣ but inhibiting
er-␤ furthermore, kgf treatment was shown to initiate
fgfr signaling by binding to  xxxg792xxx  leading to phosphorylation of akt and increasing bcl-2 expression.

fig. 2. kgf induced cell growth of pcscs. (a) kgf stimulates pcscs proliferation. stromal cells were grown in dmem/f12 with 10% fbs. before exposure
to kgf, pcscs were steroid hormones starved and cultured in 5% dcc–fbs for 48 h and then pcscs were treated with or without kgf (1–50 ng/ml) for
48 or 96 h. cell viability was measured using the mts/pms method. (b) kgf antibodies abolished cell proliferation induced by kgf in pcscs. cells were
treated with kgf (10 ng/ml) and/or kgf antibodies (100 ng/ml) for 48 h. cell viability was measured by mts/pms methods. anti-k 1 and 2 represent kgf
antiserum one and two. (c) kgf induced cyclin-d1, bcl-2,  xxxg251xxx  and phospho-akt at ser 473 (p473 -akt) expressions in pcscs. after exposure of pcscs to
the presence or absence of kgf for 48 h, cell lysates were obtained. protein levels were performed by western blot. blots were then stripped and re-probed for
␤-actin to confirm equal loading of the total protein. the numbers above the immunostained bands represented the quantified results obtained using multigauge
software. (d) kgf antibodies reduced induction of cyciln-d1, bcl-2,  xxxg251xxx  or phospho-akt by kgf. cells were exposed to kgf (10 ng/ml) and/or kgf
antibodies (100 ng/ml) for 48 h. anti-k 1 and 2 represent kgf antiserum one and two. whole cell lysates were collected and subjected to sds-page followed
by western blot for immunoreactivity against cyclin-d1, bcl-2,  xxxg251xxx  akt and ␤-actin. in (a and b) each bar represents the mean ± s.d. of four or six wells.
bars with asterisk (*) represent means that are significantly different from the control group. a probability (p) of less than 0.05 was considered statistically
significant (p < 0.05); (*) denotes results compared with vehicle only at 48 h and (**) denotes results compared with vehicle at 96 h.

3.4. tamoxifen or  xxxd2165xxx ,780 (ici) inhibited viability
of pcscs
to determine the roles of estrogen receptors on pcscs,
tamoxifen and ici were used to examine viability of pcscs.
as illustrated in fig. 4, tamoxifen significantly inhibited cell
viability starting from 100 nm treatment and viable cells were
reduced by 25% at 1 ␮m concentration. conversely, the pure
anti-estrogen, ici, also decreased cell viability significantly,
but had less of an inhibitory effect compared to tamoxifen.
there as a 15% reduction of viable pcscs observed at 1 ␮m

and the number of viable cells was decreased by 25% decrease

3.5. kgf ameliorated the effect of tamoxifen or ici
182,780 on pcscs viability
to further confirm the property of kgf as a mitotic and/or
as a survival factor for pcscs, cells were exposed or pretreated with kgf (0–50 ng/ml) for 6 h before dosing with
tamoxifen (1 ␮m) or ici (1 ␮m) for another 96 h. cell via-

fig. 3. kgf-regulated dynamic protein expression in pcscs. pcscs were exposed to the presence or absence of kgf  xxxd1891xxx  ng/ml and assayed at different time
points, and cell lysates were collected in lysis buffer. cell extracts were subjected to sds-page and subsequent western blotting against akt, phospho-akt
(p473 -akt), bcl-2 cyclin-d1, er-␣, er-␤ and  xxxg792xxx . blots were stripped and re-probed with ␤-actin to confirm equal loading of the total protein.

bilities were measured to demonstrate mitogenic activity of
kgf. as shown in fig. 5, in co-treatment of pcscs with
1–20 ng/ml of kgf and tamoxifen resulted in significantly
lower cell viability than that of vehicle treatment; however,
50 ng/ml of kgf abolished the effect of tamoxifen (fig. 5a).
in contrast, kgf treatment did not result in increased cell
viability when co-administered with ici compared with ici
treatment alone (fig. 5b).
on the other hand, pretreatment with kgf in combination
with tamoxifen or ici for 6 h triggered cell proliferation. the
results in fig. 5c showed that tamoxifen reduced cell viability, although pre-exposure of cells to as little as 10 ng/ml
kgf significantly increased cell viability. furthermore, pretreatment with 50 ng/ml kgf abolished the negative effect
of tamoxifen on cell viability compared to tamoxifen alone.
kgf (50 ng/ml) treatment markedly increased cell viability compared to vehicle treatment (fig. 5c). similarly, kgf
treatment appeared to ameliorate the negative effect of ici
on cell viability inhibition (fig. 5d). these results indicated
that kgf treatment triggered cell proliferation of pcscs and

might serve as an anti-apoptotic factor to counter-act the negative effects of anti-estrogens, such as tamoxifen and ici on
cell viability.
3.6. kgf treatment abrogated the inhibition of
cyclin-d1, bcl-2 and phospho-akt expression in pcscs
due to tamoxifen or ic 182,780
to assess the regulation of cell viability between kgf and
tamoxifen or ici on pcscs, cells were treated with kgf,
tamoxifen or ici or combination for 3 or 48 h (fig. 6). our
data showed kgf stimulated bcl-2 expression as early as
3 h into treatment which persisted at 48 h and kgf treatment resulted in phosphorylation of akt at ser 473 and
up-regulation of er-␣ expression at 48 h. in contrast, tamoxifen or ici did not induce protein expression of phospho-akt,
bcl-2, cyclin-d1 and er-␣. cells co-treated with kgf and
tamoxifen or ici, had reduced expression of cyclin-d1 and
bcl-2 proteins compared to control groups at both 3 and
48 h, indicating that phospho-akt and er-␣ expression were

fig. 5. kgf ameliorated the reduction of pcscs viability induced by treatment with tamoxifen (tam) or  xxxd2165xxx ,780 (ici). stromal cells were grown in
dmem/f12 with 10% fbs. prior to kgf exposure, pcscs were serum starvation and treated (a and b) or pre-treated (c and d) with or without kgf
(1–50 ng/ml) for 6 h in presence 1 ␮m of tam (a and c) or ici (b and d) for 96 h. at the end of treatment, cell viability was measured using the mts/pms
method. each bar represents the mean ± s.d. of six wells. bar with asterisk (*) represent means that are significantly different from the control group. a
probability (p) of less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant (p < 0.05); (*) denotes results compared with vehicle only and (**) denotes results
compared with only tam or ici treatment.

inhibited at 48 h in cells co-exposed to kgf with tamoxifen or with ici, compared with that of kgf treated only
(fig. 6). tamoxifen had a more inhibitory effect on phosphoakt expression than ici. these data suggested that the effect
of kgf, tamoxifen and ici on cell viability might be mediated through modulation cyclin-d1, bcl-2 and phospho-akt
expression in pcscs.

4. discussion
kgf was originally identified as a paracrine growth factor secreted by stromal cells and targeted to epithelial cells
that expressed  xxxg792xxx . however, leung et al. showed that
 xxxg792xxx  was expressed in du-145 cells, a prostate epithelial cancer cell line and cultured fibroblast and epithelium
from prostate cancer patients [18]. our results showed that

 xxxg792xxx  mrna is present in pcscs as well as du-145 and
pc-3 cells, which are prostate cancer epithelial cell lines.
du-145 cells are known to express different fgfrs including  xxxg791xxx , fgfr2iiib, fgfr2iiic and  xxxg794xxx  [19,20]. in
our study,  xxxg792xxx  protein, also called bek, was demonstrated
in both pcscs and mcf-7, a human breast caner cell line.
kgf is expressed in both of bph and prostate cancer, and
likely has a role in regulating the differentiation and development of the prostate epithelium. however, its precise role
in prostate tumorigenesis remains unclear as some studies
highlight the expression of kgf transcripts mainly in stromal cells and not in epithelial cells [18,21], but others report
that kgf is expressed by both cells types [22]. our previous
studies showed that kgf mrna was detected in the isolated
stromal cells from human breast cancer tissues [23].  xxxg792xxx 
expression in pcscs might result from the alternate splicing
of the  xxxg792xxx  gene from fgfr2iiic to fgfr2iiib ( xxxg792xxx ). it is clear

fig. 6. kgf treatment modulated protein expression induced by tamoxifen (tam) or  xxxd2165xxx ,780 (ici) in pcscs. stromal cells were treated with or without
kgf (10 ng/ml) and/or 1 ␮m of tam or ici for 3 or 48 h, after steroid hormones starvation. at the end of treatment, whole cell lysates were collected and
subjected to sds-page and subsequent western blot. transblotted membranes were probed with different antibodies and re-probed for ␤-actin to confirm
equal loading of protein. the numbers above the immunostained bands represent the quantified results obtained using multigauge software.

from our current and previous findings that pcscs possess
 xxxg792xxx , which can bind with kgf and might have autocrine
activity in pcscs.
it is of note that kgf is a mitogenic effector for epithelial
cells. planz et al. [24] reported that epithelial cells showed significant time- and dose-dependent stimulation of cell proliferation with kgf. leung et al. [18] also found that functional
assessment of recombinant kgf demonstrated a mitogenic
effect on up to 100% of cultured prostatic epithelial cells in a
proliferation assay. we showed that kgf also has a mitogenic
effect on prostate cancer stromal cells and the stimulation of
cell proliferation occurs in a dose- and/or time-dependent
manner.
fgf receptor (fgfr) signaling can activate multiple signal transduction pathways including the phospholipase c␥, phosphatidyl inositol 3-kinase (pi3k), mitogen-activated
protein kinase (mapk) and signal transducers and activators
of transcription (stat) pathways, all of which play important
roles in prostate cancerous progression [25]. in alveolar type
ii cells, which are progenitor cells of the alveolar epithelium,
kgf alone greatly stimulated proliferation and increased
 xxxg410xxx  kinase activity and rb phosphorylation [26]. it was also
found that cyclin-d1,  xxxg410xxx  and cdc25a protein levels were
increased, while p15 ( xxxg422xxx ) and p27 ( xxxg419xxx ) protein levels
were decreased [26]. our study showed that kgf stimulates
pcscs proliferation that correlated with up-regulation of
cyclin-d1 which might involve the  xxxg792xxx  signaling pathway.
the akt/protein kinase b (pkb) kinase is a wellcharacterized effector of pi3k and its deregulation plays
important roles in the pathogenesis of human cancers. pi3k
signaling through second messengers is involved in multiple cellular functions including proliferation, differentiation,
anti-apoptosis, tumorigenesis and angiogenesis [27]. cyclind expression induced by serum resulted from enhanced trans-

lation of its mrna via pi3k and akt kinase [28]. on the other
hand, blockade of pi3k/akt signaling by the pi3k inhibitor,
 xxxd2523xxx  inhibited cyclin-d1 protein expression in human
prostate cancer cells [29]. we found that kgf induced
cyclin-d1 protein expression in a dose-dependent fashion.
from time course experiments, kgf maintained phosphoakt to 5 min and cyclin-d1 protein expression decreased after
3 h, which might indicate kgf induced akt signaling and
enhanced cyclin-d1 translation.
the akt/pkb pathway has been shown to increase expression of the anti-apoptotic gene bcl-2 in some cell types
[30,31]. induction of bcl-2 promoter activity by igf-1 was
shown to occur via the pkb/akt pathway involving the cyclic
amp (camp) response element binding protein (creb)
transcription factor. creb is a direct target for phosphorylation by pkb/akt [32] and this phosphorylation occurs on
a site that increases binding of creb to accessory proteins
necessary for induction of genes containing camp responsive
elements (cres) in their promoter regions. it is interesting
to note that kgf also increases phospho-akt as well as antiapoptotic effectors, bcl-2 and  xxxg251xxx  in a dose-dependent
manner. we also showed that kgf affected dynamic changes
in protein expression. kgf treatment increased the amount
of phosphorylated akt after 3 h treatment and resulted in
increased bcl-2 protein expression slowly after 12 h treatment. although these results might not correlate earlier
data showing that kgf treatment lead to phosphorylate akt
within 15 min [33], our findings are coincident with cell
viability results in which kgf (10 ng/ml) took more time
(96 h) to stimulate cell proliferation. based on the results
of our study, kgf might serve as an anti-apoptotic factor
rather than a mitogenic effector. this idea is consistent with
another report [33] revealing kgf as a survival factor. in
lung cancer epithelial cells, kgf induces akt kinase activity,

32

y.-w. huang et al. / journal of steroid biochemistry & molecular biology 100 (2006) 24–33

inhibits fas-mediated apoptosis and protects the lung epithelium by inhibiting apoptosis through activation of pi3k/aktmediated cell survival pathway [33]. our previous study also
suggested kgf played a role in the control of breast tumor
survival and progression via increasing akt phosphorylation,
which was blocked by  xxxd2523xxx  and through preventing
tamoxifen-induced dna fragmentation [34].
estrogen receptors have been demonstrated to locate in
different cell types of the prostate. in normal prostate, er␤ is localized predominantly to the basal epithelial cells,
where er-␣ is rarely found [35]. in contrast, er-␣ is mainly
expressed in the stroma of the normal prostatic gland [35] and
may contribute to the pathogenesis of prostate cancer. tamaru
et al. [13] found that er-␣ may be involved in kgf expression, and that kgf may have an anti-apoptotic roles, rather
than mitogenic role in human breast cancer. our study showed
that pcscs express both er-␣ and er-␤. kgf treatment of
pcscs resulted in a slight increase in er-␣ at different time
points and a decrease in er-␤ after 3 h exposed to kgf.
the precise biological functions of the two er subtypes in
the prostate are currently undefined. liu et al. [36] reported
that er-␣ and er-␤ had opposing action on cyclin-d1 gene
expression and er-␤ as a modulator of the proliferative
effects of estrogen. cyclin-d1 is not a classical estrogen
regulatory gene. furthermore, er could interact with other
transcription factors, such as fos and jun proteins on  xxxg1222xxx 
response elements to alter cyclin-d1 transcription [36]. in
contrast, bcl-2 is a well-characterized estrogen-regulated
gene and activation of bcl-2 by estrogen requires an sp1 binding site, a creb and an estrogen response element
(ere) on the bcl-2 promoter [37]. our data showed that
cyclin-d1 expression started to decrease after 3 h kgf treatment, which is consistent with er-␤ expression. kgf stimulated er-␣ expression in a dose-dependent fashion at 48 h. at
different times, the results showed that kgf modulated er-␣
protein expression. er-␣ is phosphorylated by akt [38] and
this phospho-er-␣ induces its target gene expression, which
might involve anti-estrogen resistance [38,39]. we speculate
that kgf and/or  xxxg792xxx  signaling might crosstalk with  xxxg730xxx  pathways to regulate functional pcscs in the
microenvironment of prostate cancer.
in our investigation of the roles of kgf and estrogen
receptors on pcscs, we demonstrated that tamoxifen and
ici reduced the cell viability of pcscs in a dose-dependent
manner. when cells were treated to kgf with tamoxifen or
ici simultaneously, kgf was slightly protective against the
negative effect of tamoxifen and ici on cell viability. however, cells pre-treated with kgf could block this effect which
also was dose-dependent. these results were confirmed by
the observation that kgf treatment led to phosporylation of
akt and increased bcl-2 expression at 3 h. the combination
of kgf with tamoxifen or ici significantly decreased the
phospho-akt and bcl-2 protein expression. our studies also
demonstrate that kgf increased er-␣, however, tamoxifen
and ici inhibited er-␣ expression. kgf has been shown to
protect against cell death [33,40]. furthermore, kgf inhib-

ited lung epithelial cell death induced by hyperoxia [40] and
induction of cell survival pathways revealed kgf-induced
activation of akt signaling both in vitro and in vivo [33,40].
taken together, our findings showed that kgf protected
against the negative effects of anti-estrogenic agents, tamoxifen and ici on cell viability of prostate cancer stromal cells.
our current study clearly demonstrated that primary cultured human prostate cancer stromal cells express er-␣, er␤ and  xxxg792xxx . kgf treatment induced cell proliferation that
might be correlated with or mediated through binding with
its receptor,  xxxg792xxx  and up-regulation of cyclin-d1, bcl-2
and phospho-akt expression. the results of functional analysis proved that kgf has autocrine ability in primary human
prostate cancer stromal cells. expression of estrogen receptors in pcscs reveals the therapeutic potential for the use of
anti-estrogenic agents, such as tamoxifen and ici for reducing prostate cancer proliferation. importantly, the stimulation
of cyclin-d1, bcl-2 and phospho-akt expression in response
to kgf was abolished by tamoxifen or ici. conversely, kgf
triggered cell cycle machinery or increased expression of
anti-apoptotic proteins could abolish the reduction in cell viability due to tamoxifen or ici. in conclusion, anti-estrogenic
agents could have therapeutic effects by disrupting the proliferative action on stromal cells within the prostate cancer
microenvironment.
