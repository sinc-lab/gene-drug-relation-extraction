abstract
the effects of association of cholinergic precursors choline or choline alphoscerate with the cholinesterase inhibitor rivastigmine on
acetylcholine levels and [3h] xxxd2264xxx  binding were assessed in rat frontal cortex, hippocampus and striatum. acetylcholine immunoreactivity was also evaluated in cerebrocortical cholinergic fibers by immunohistochemistry. choline alphoscerate or rivastigmine, but not choline
increased acetylcholine levels as well as [3h] xxxd2264xxx  binding used as a marker of high affinity cholinergic transporter. the association of
choline alphoscerate with rivastigmine dose-dependently increased both acetylcholine levels and [3h] xxxd2264xxx  binding. rivastigmine
alone or in association with either choline or choline alphoscerate decreased acetylcholinesterase (ache), whereas choline or choline alphoscerate
alone did not affect ache activity. choline alphoscerate or rivastigmine alone or in association, but not choline increased acetylcholine
immunoreactivity in nerve fibers supplying cerebral cortex. these data suggest that combination of a suitable precursor of brain acetylcholine such
as choline alphoscerate and of a cholinesterase inhibitor may represent an association worthwhile of being further investigated as a cholinergic
replacement therapy in pathologies characterized by altered cholinergic neurotransmission.

1. introduction
the observation that administration of the muscarinic
receptor antagonist scopolamine to healthy young subjects
induced a transient cognitive impairment resembling that found
in adult-onset dementia disorders (drachman and leavitt,
1974) and the demonstration of a remarkable decrease of
 xxxg440xxx  (chat) activity in the cerebral cortex
and hippocampus in alzheimer’s disease (ad) (davies and
maloney, 1976; bowen, 1977) contributed to the development
of the cholinergic hypothesis of geriatric memory dysfunction
(bartus et al., 1982). although the cholinergic system is not the
only neurotransmitter system affected in adult-onset dementia
disorders (mcentee and crook, 1990), cholinergic function
changes are strongly implicated in the pathogenesis of learning
and memory impairment in dementia disorders including

alzheimer’s disease (drachman, 1977; lippa et al., 1980;
bartus et al., 1982, 1987).
as a consequence of the cholinergic hypothesis of memory
dysfunction in ad (bartus et al., 1982), cholinergic strategies
were tried for relieving cognitive impairment of the disease.
approaches to replacement of lost cholinergic function
included the use of cholinergic precursors, acetylcholinereleasing agents, muscarinic cholinergic receptor agonists and
inhibition of acetylcholinesterase (ache), the catabolic
enzyme for acetylcholine (davis et al., 1993). the results of
clinical studies with acetylcholine precursors will be detailed
below. other approaches with acetylcholine-releasing agents or
muscarinic agonists have provided weak results (bowen, 1977;
davies and maloney, 1976). ache/cholinesterase inhibitors
(tacrine, donepezil, rivastigmine and galantamine) gave
positive results and are, together the more recently developed
drug memantine, the only approved compounds for the
symptomatic treatment of dementia in ad (gauthier, 2002).
the cognitive enhancing action of ache/cholinesterase inhibitors is based on their capability of increasing acetylcholine levels

and bioavailability in the synaptic cleft and to prolong
acetylcholine activity on postsynaptic and/or presynaptic
receptors (gualtieri et al., 1995). these drugs are likely to
provide cognitive benefit for a limited number of affected
patients (defined responder subjects) (gualtieri et al., 1995).
the cholinergic precursor loading therapy was the first
approach tried to relief cognitive impairment in dementia
disorders, but controlled clinical trials failed to show significant
improvements with choline or lecithin, a choline-containing
phospholipid (davis et al., 1993). choline alphoscerate (alphaglyceryl phosphoryl choline) probably is a particular acetylcholine precursors. it is a precursor in the biosynthesis of brain
phospholipids (smith et al., 1957; stein and shapiro, 1957), has
been shown to increase the bioavailability of acetylcholine in
nervous tissue (sigala et al., 1992), to counter age-related brain
microanatomical changes (bronzetti et al., 1991) and was
effective in improving cognitive function in dementia disorders
of neurodegenerative or vascular origin (parnetti et al., 2001;
amenta et al., 2002; de jesus moreno, 2003).
the present study was designed to compare the effects of the
two acetylcholine biosynthesis precursors choline and choline
alphoscerate on acetylcholine and of its high affinity transporter
in selected brain areas. the influence of association of these
precursors with the ache inhibitor rivastigmine was assessed
as well.
2. materials and methods
2.1. animals and pharmacological treatment
adult male wistar rats (200–250 g body weight, charles river, calco,
italy) were used. animals were handled according to internationally accepted
principles for care of laboratory animals (e.e.c. council directive 86/609,
qjl358, 1, december 12, 1987). they were kept under a constant light–dark
cycle (7:00 a.m.–7:00 p.m. light period), at an ambient temperature of
22  1 8c, with free access to water and laboratory chow. two weeks after
arrival, they were randomly allotted to the following groups: (a) vehicletreated (n = 8); (b) choline-treated (n = 10); (c) choline alphoscerate-treated
(n = 10); (d) rivastigmine-treated (n = 12); (e) choline plus rivastigmine
(0.625 mg/kg)-treated; (f) choline plus rivastigmine (2.5 mg/kg)-treated;
(g) choline alphoscerate plus rivastigmine (0.625 mg/kg)-treated (n = 12);
(h) choline alphoscerate plus rivastigmine (2.5 mg/kg)-treated (n = 12). treatment with different compounds lasted for 7 days. choline and choline
alphoscerate were administered intraperitoneally, dissolved in 1 ml of distilled
water, at the doses of 400 and 150 mg/kg/day, respectively. rivastigmine was
administered once a day orally by gavage after re-suspending in polyethylene
glycol dissolved 1:3 with distilled water. appropriate doses of the compound
were then administered in a final volume of 1 ml. for control, rats of choline-,
choline alphoscerate- and of rivastigmine-treated groups received intraperitoneally or orally vehicle. at the end of treatment, the 50% of animals of each
group randomly selected was used for neurochemical assays and the remaining
50% for immunohistochemistry.

2.2. acetylcholine and acetylcholinesterase assay
rats were decapitated. brains were removed and placed on a cold plate.
frontal cortex, hippocampus and striatum were rapidly dissected on ice,
separated for acetylcholine or other assays, weighed, frozen on dry ice and
kept at 80 8c until assayed. acetylcholine concentrations were determined by
gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (wood and stotland, 1980). frozen
tissues were sonicated for 30 s in ice-cold 1n hcl containing 75 pmol of
acetylcholine as internal standard and centrifuged for 30 min at 15,000 rpm.

supernatants were put into borosilicate vials, frozen and lyophilized. choline
in samples was phosphorylated in 150 mm phosphate buffer (ph 8.0) containing 1 mm atp, 6 mm mgcl2 and 20 rnu/sample  xxxg445xxx  for 45 min at
25 8c. following extraction of acetylcholine with sodium tetraphenylborate in
10 mg/ml 3-heptanone for 15 min and rapid centrifugation, the lower aqueous
phase containing  xxxd2929xxx  was discarded. the upper organic phase
was transferred into another set of vials and re-extracted for 30 min in 1n hcl.
after centrifugation, the upper organic phase was aspired and removed,
whereas the aqueous acidic phase was frozen and lyophilized. after esterification at 80 8c for 30 min, samples were re-dissolved in a mixture of sodium
benzene thiolate (175 mg)/methyl ethyl ketone (20 ml)/glacial acetic acid
(35 ml). they were subsequently incubated at 80 8c for 45 min under nitrogen
to demethylate the quaternary ammonium compounds synthesized in the
esterification step. at the end of this reaction, samples were extracted with
 xxxd1710xxx  and washed twice with pentane. the aqueous phase was re-extracted
onto ethyl acetate with dibasic ammonium citrate and ammonium hydroxide.
extracts were then concentrated under nitrogen and were injected into a
hewlett packard (hp) gas chromatography–mass spectrometer. integration
of the acetylcholine peaks was performed by a hp computer and compared to
the peaks of internal standards. for each experiment external standards of 0, 1,
5, 10, 50 and 75 pmol were assayed along with the test samples. the
concentrations of acetylcholine in each sample were calculated by regression
analysis obtained from blank values and external standards and were expressed
in pmol/mg of protein.

2.3. [3h] xxxd2264xxx  binding and ache assay
samples of frontal cortex, striatum and hippocampus not used for acetylcholine assay were homogenized in 20 vols. of ice-cold 50 mm sodium–potassium
phosphate buffer (ph 7.4). homogenates were in part frozen on dry-ice and/or
further homogenate to obtain supernant and pellet fraction and stored at 80 8c
until assay. binding assay was carried out on whole homogenates (sandberg and
coyle, 1985). aliquots of homogenate (200–400 mg protein) were incubated in
triplicate in a total volume of 0.25 ml of 150 mm nacl in 50 mm sodium
phosphate buffer, containing increasing concentration of [3h] xxxd2264xxx 
(see below) in the absence (total binding) or in the presence (non-specific
binding) of 10 mm unlabeled  xxxd2264xxx . specific binding was then
expressed as fmol [3h] xxxd2264xxx  bound/mg protein. the incubation
was carried out at 25 8c for 60 min with constant agitation to achieve
equilibrium. after incubation, samples were immediately filtered on glass fiber
filter (gf/b) pre-soaked in assay buffer containing 0.1% (v/v) polyethylene
amine for 60 min to reduce non-specific binding. filters were rapidly washed
three times each with 5 ml of ice-cold assay buffer and placed in scintillation
vials containing 5 ml of a scintillation cocktail. radioactivity was then measured by scintillation spectrometry.
saturability of [3h] xxxd2264xxx  specific binding was determined using
a range of radioligand concentrations from 0.7 to 42 nm. the binding parameters dissociation constant (kd) and maximum density of binding sites (bmax)
were calculated by non-linear regression with the aid of radlig program
(biosoft, cambridge, uk). protein assay was determined as above mentioned.
activity of ache was assayed in pellets of frontal cortex, hippocampus and
striatum using the method of ellman et al. (1961). protein was measured by the
method of lowry et al. (1951), using bovine  xxxg124xxx  (bsa) as a
standard.

2.4. acetylcholine immunohistochemistry
for acetylcholine immunohistochemistry the solutions indicated below
were prepared: solution a: 0.1 m sodium cacodylate and 10 g/l sodium
metabisulphide (ph 6.2); solution b: 0.1 m sodium cacodylate and 1 m allyl
alcohol (ph 12.4); solution c: 0.1 m sodium cacodylate and 10 g/l sodium
metabisulphide, glutaraldehyde 2.5% (ph 7.5); solution d: 0.05 m tris and 8–
5 g/l sodium metabisulphide (ph 7.5); solution e: 0.05 m tris and 8.5 g/l nacl
(ph 7.5).
rats were perfused with a mixture composed by 30 ml of solution a,
500 ml of solution b and 500 ml of solution c. at the end of perfusion the skull
was opened and the brain was removed and cut into 2–3 mm thick slices that
were post fixed for 1 h with solution c, followed by four washes with solution

f. amenta et al. / mechanisms of ageing and development 127 (2006) 173–179
c. slices were then transferred in a 30% sucrose solution for 12 h at 4 8c and
then frozen in a dry ice–acetone mixture. serial 15 mm thick sections were
obtained using a 20 8c microtome cryostat and mounted on polylisinated
microscope slides that were stored at 80 8c until used. slides were preincubated 3  15 min in solution b and then for 60 min in solution d containing 3% non-immune serum. sections were then exposed for 3 h at 25 8c to an
anti-acetylcholine antibody raised in rabbit and diluted 1:100 in solution e plus
1% non-immune serum. after incubation, sections were washed 3  10 min
with solution e to remove excess antibody and then exposed for 30 min at 25 8c
to biotinylated anti-rabbit secondary antibody at a 1:200 dilution. the product
of immune reaction was then revealed using the biotin-streptavidin immunostaining kit with 0.05% 3,3-diaminobenzidine in 0.1% h2o2 as a chromogen.
sections were then washed, dehydrated in ethanol, mounted in a synthetic
mounting medium and viewed at a light microscope. the specificity of immune
reaction was assessed by incubating control sections with anti-acetylcholine
antibodies pre-adsorbed with acetylcholine or by exposing them to a nonimmune serum instead of the primary antibody. microanatomical analysis was
concentrated an frontal cortex, a brain area supplied by cholinergic fibers
originating from nucleus basalis magnocellularis (nbm).
sections parallel to those processed for acetylcholine immunohistochemistry were processed for chat immunohistochemistry according to the procedure detailed in a previous study of our group (sabbatini et al., 1998). this to
evaluate the correspondence of findings of acetylcholine and chat immunoreactivity and therefore to confirm indirectly the specificity of acetylcholine
immune reaction.

2.5. data analysis
data of acetylcholine levels, ache activity, [3h] xxxd2264xxx  binding
and acetylcholine immunohistochemistry obtained in the different animal
groups were compared by one way analysis of variance (anova), followed
by duncan’s multiple range test. a p value <0.05 was considered as cut off of
significance.

2.6. chemicals
choline alphoscerate (delecit1) and rivastigmine (exelon1) were obtained
from mdm pharma (milan, italy) and novartis (basle, switzerland), respectively. [3h] xxxd2264xxx  (specific activity 123.2–128.6 ci/mmol) was purchased from new england nuclear (boston, ma, usa). anti-acetylcholine
antibodies raised in rabbits (cat. no. 0030-2004, batch 21010252) were obtained
by bio-trend (cologne, germany). the purity of these antibodies was assessed
by elisa, whereas their specificity was evaluated by western blotting. antirabbit peroxidase conjugated secondary antibodies were purchased from roche
diagnostic gmbh, mannheim, germany. other chemicals were purchased from
sigma–aldrich co. (st. louis, mo, usa).

3. results
3.1. acetylcholine levels
data on acetylcholine levels in frontal cortex, hippocampus
and striatum of rats of different groups investigated are
summarized in table 1. choline did not induce changes of
acetylcholine levels, whereas choline alphoscerate or rivastigmine alone significantly increased acetylcholine levels
(table 1). choline in association with rivastigmine did not
induce further changes of acetylcholine levels compared to
rivastigmine alone (table 1). choline alphoscerate and
rivastigmine in association induced a more pronounced
increase of acetylcholine levels than when compounds were
administered alone. choline alphoscerate plus the higher dose
of rivastigmine induced a more pronounced increase of
acetylcholine levels compared to the association between

175

choline alphoscerate and the lower dose of rivastigmine
(table 1). the effect of choline alphoscerate and rivastigmine
was slightly more pronounced on hippocampus than on frontal
cortex or striatum (table 1).
3.2. acetylcholinesterase activity
data on ache activity in frontal cortex, hippocampus and
striatum of rats of groups investigated are summarized in
table 2. choline or choline alphoscerate were without effect on
ache activity (table 2). the dose of 2.5 mg/kg of rivastigmine
alone or in association with either choline or choline
alphoscerate decreased ache activity by about 50%, whereas
the dose of 0.625 mg/kg of rivastigmine decreased ache
activity by about 25% (table 2).
3.3. [3h] xxxd2264xxx  binding
[3h] xxxd2264xxx  was specifically bound to frontal
cortex, hippocampus and striatum. the binding was dosedependent and plateauned with radioligand concentrations
between 15 and 25 nm. kd values of [3h] xxxd2264xxx 
binding averaged 8.8  0.4 nm in frontal cortex, 8.5  0.6 nm
in hippocampus and 8.9  0.7 nm in striatum. the bmax values
are reported in table 3. treatment with choline alphoscerate or
rivastigmine, but not with choline significantly increased
[3h] xxxd2264xxx  binding to rat frontal cortex, hippocampus and striatum (table 3). the association of choline
alphoscerate and rivastigmine caused a further dose-dependent
increase of [3h] xxxd2264xxx  binding (table 3). values
obtained with choline plus rivastigmine were similar to those
found with rivastigmine alone (table 3).
3.4. acetylcholine immunohistochemistry
section processed for acetycholine immunohistochemistry
developed a pattern of immune reaction (fig. 1a) similar to that
obtained by chat immunohiostochemistry (fig. 1b). in the
frontal cortex, sections exposed to acetylcholine antibodies
developed immune reaction within nerve fiber-like structures
(fig. 2). the main accumulation of immune staining occurred
in layers i and ii and in the lower portions of layer v (fig. 2a).
immune staining was more pronounced in sections obtained
from choline alphoscerate- or rivastigmine-treated rats (fig. 2b
and c). no changes in immune staining were induced by
treatment with choline (data not shown). association of choline
alphoscerate and rivastigmine caused a more pronounced
increase of acetylcholine immunostaining compared to the two
compounds alone (fig. 2d).
4. discussion
marked cortical cholinergic dysfunction is a trait of ad and
is associated with loss of cognition and memory. based on the
cholinergic hypothesis of geriatric memory dysfunction (bartus
et al., 1982), the first attempts to treat pharmacologically ad
have considered the use of cholinergic-enhancing drugs. in

view of the positive results obtained with administration of the
neurotransmitter precursor l-dopa in the treatment of
parkinson’s disease, precursor loading with cholinergic
precursors such as choline and lecithin was the first cholinergic
approach for treating ad (davies and maloney, 1976). despite
the encouraging early results, controlled trials did not confirm a
clinically relevant effect of these precursors alone or in
association with cholinesterase inhibitors (tacrine plus choline,
or physostigmine plus choline), with no effects superior to those
obtained with cholinesterase inhibitors alone (thal et al., 1986;
perryman and fitten, 1991, 1993; weinstein et al., 1991). it was
hypothesised that negative results of cholinergic precursor
loading approach were due to the wrong choice of the
acetylcholine precursor (for a review, see amenta et al., 2001).
among cholinergic precursors assessed for the treatment of
adult-onset cognitive decline, choline alphoscerate is probably
one of the most effective, in increasing acetylcholine
bioavailbility (sigala et al., 1992). in view of this, we have
investigated in the rat if association of cholinergic precursors
such as choline and choline alphoscerate with the cholinesterase inhibitor rivastigmine induces a potentiation of cholinergic
neurotransmission.
our study has shown that choline alphoscerate but not
choline increased acetylcholine levels in frontal cortex,
hippocampus and striatum. the increase of acetylcholine
levels elicited by choline alphoscerate is similar to that caused
by a dose of rivastigmine corresponding to the ed50 for ache.

the effects of choline, choline alphoscerate and of rivastigmine
observed in the present work are consistent with former studies
on the influence of the compounds on acetylcholine release in
cerebral cortex, hippocampus and striatum (imperato et al.,
1991; sigala et al., 1992; kosasa et al., 1999; bejar et al., 1999).
association between choline alphoscerate and rivastigmine
increased acetylcholine levels and neural immunoreactivity to a
larger extent than the two compounds alone. the concomitant
administration of choline alphoscerate and of a dose of
rivastigmine four-fold lower than the ed50 (trabace et al.,
2000) increased acetylcholine levels and immunoreactivity,
being this increase more pronounced in an area related to
learning and memory such as hippocampus.
an increased bioavailability of acetylcholine by choline
alphoscerate and rivastigmine is also documented by the
observation that the two compounds alone or in association
increase [3h] xxxd2264xxx  binding in the brain areas
investigated. [3h] xxxd2264xxx  is a specific ligand for the
high-affinity choline uptake site, and is considered a marker for
cholinergic terminals (vickroy et al., 1984; sandberg and
coyle, 1985). the observation of an increased density of
[3h] xxxd2264xxx  binding by treatment with choline
alphoscerate and/or rivastigmine indicates augmented bioavailability of acetylcholine induced by pharmacological treatment.
in this study, we have documented that choline alphoscerate
and rivastigmine together induced a more pronounced increase
of acetylcholine levels and of [3h] xxxd2264xxx  binding

than when administered alone. for technical reasons our
analysis was limited to assessment of acetylcholine content
instead of evaluating its release that is a more suitable indicator
of acetylcholine concentrations in cholinergic synapses
(imperato et al., 1991; sigala et al., 1992; bejar et al., 1999;
kosasa et al., 1999). in view of this, our study was enlarged to
the analysis of acetylcholine immunoreactive stores in frontal
cortex. the observation that pharmacological manipulation
with choline alphoscerate or rivastigmine increased acetylcholine immunoreactivity within cerebrocortical fibers suggests
that the two compounds alone or in association but not choline,
increase neuronal acetylcholine content in brain neurons. in
order to perform the different assays in the same samples, we
did not sacrificed animals by microwave irradiation. this
procedure may cause a rapid decrease of acetylcholine due to
the enhanced cholinesterase activity between killing and
dissection procedures (stavinoha et al., 1973). in our study,
we have seen that not only rivastigmine, that inhibiting ache
may reduce post-mortem acetylcholine degradation, but also
treatment with choline alphoscerate alone increased brain
acetylcholine levels. this suggests that in spite of the potential
problems of the killing procedure used, acetylcholine assay was
enough sensitive to detect changes induced by pharmacological
treatment.
in summary, our data suggest that combination of the
precursor in the biosynthesis of acetylcholine choline
alphoscerate and of the cholinesterase inhibitor rivastigmine
may represent an association worthwhile of being further
investigated as a possible approach in cholinergic replacement
therapy of ad. the advantage of the proposed association
versus cholinesterase inhibitor as monotherapy is represented
by the lower doses of cholinesterase inhibitor necessary for
increasing brain levels of acetylcholine. this may be useful for
reducing the probability of side or toxic effects (primarily
gastrointestinal and hepatic) induced by cholinesterase
inhibitors (gauthier, 2002). another potential advantage of
the association could be in making available larger amounts of
choline and consequently of acetylcholine in patients in which

cholinesterase inhibition may be not effective due to low levels
of neurotransmitter in cholinergic synapses.
