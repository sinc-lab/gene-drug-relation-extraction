summary the objective of these studies was to characterize the effects of a broad range of prostanoid agonists upon the
stimulation of camp production in national cancer bank (ncb-20; mouse neuroblastoma/hamster brain hybridoma) cells.
the pharmacology of these functional responses in ncb-20 cells was compared with that of the classic endogenous  xxxg1879xxx 
present on human platelets using [3h]- xxxd2331xxx  binding techniques. in both assay systems, agonists from the ip prostanoid class
exhibited the highest affinities and functional potencies. specific prostanoids exhibited the following rank order of potency
(ec507sem) in stimulating camp productioninthe ncb-20 cells: carbaprostacyclin (4.370.9 nm) = pgi2 (6.671.5 nm) 4  xxxd2331xxx

prostanoid receptor ligands at the endogenous  xxxg1879xxx  in two different cell types. & 2001harcourt publishers ltd

introduction
prostanoid receptors are classified based on their pharmacological and biochemical responses to the endogenous prostaglandin (pg) agonists  xxxg1073xxx , pge2,  xxxd1902xxx , pgi2
and thromboxane a2.1–3 these heptahelical membranebound receptors, designated dp, ep, fp, ip and tp,
respectively, have been cloned.4,5 the ep receptor family
is presently subdivided into the ep1,  xxxg1873xxx , ep3 and  xxxg1875xxx 
subtypes with further isoforms of the  xxxg1874xxx . the
ep1, ep3, fp and tp prostanoid receptors are positively
coupled to phospholipase c through the gq/11 g-protein
and stimulate phoshophoinositide (pi) turnover and the
mobilization of intracellular calcium.3 the dp,  xxxg1873xxx ,  xxxg1875xxx ,
and ip receptors stimulate adenylyl cyclase, the enzyme
which catalyzes the conversion of atp to cyclic adeno-

sine-30 ,50 -monophosphate (camp) through the g-protein
gs.3,6 a recent report suggests that the  xxxg1879xxx  plays a
role in mediating  xxxg2253xxx  signalling in a protein
kinase a-dependent manner.7
molecular biology studies have characterized the ip
receptor isolated from a human lung cdna library. this
receptor has been shown to be a protein of approximately
386 amino acids forming seven putative membrane
spanning regions. the  xxxg1879xxx  shares a phylogenetic
subfamily with the gs coupled dp,  xxxg1873xxx  and  xxxg1875xxx  prostanoid receptors.8–11 compared with prostanoid receptors
of other classes, the human  xxxg1879xxx  shows the greatest
degree of homology to the human  xxxg1873xxx  (approximately 60%) and the least to the human  xxxg1878xxx .4,5
evidence of human  xxxg1879xxx  mrna expression has
been observed in such diverse tissues as the aorta,
cerebral arteries, coronary arteries, dorsal root ganglia,
kidney, liver, lung, platelets, etc.4,12–15
activation of the  xxxg1879xxx  plays a major
role in a variety of physiological processes. for instance,
this membrane protein is involved in the control of
vascular tone and inhibition of platelet aggregation.3,16,17

in addition, the  xxxg1879xxx  appears to mediate relaxation
of the human pulmonary and uterine arteries.12,18 this
protein is expressed in glomerular mesangial cells,
endothelial cells and podoctyes where it may function
to regulate hemodynamics in the kidney.19 in the renal
arterioles, the  xxxg1879xxx  may play a role in the
modulation of renal arterial resistance and renin
release.20 sensory afferent nerves express ip receptors,
which mediate excitation, involved in nociception.15,21
smith and colleagues15 have suggested that selective
blockade of sensory neuronal ip receptors may provide a
novel approach to the alleviation of pain.
most of the published studies to date have included
only a limited number of compounds or have utilized
recombinant receptor preparations to pharmacologically
characterize the  xxxg1879xxx . the ncb-20 cell line, a
hybrid between the mouse neuroblastoma and fetal
hamster brain, has been shown to express the ip
receptor.22 this prostanoid receptor is also found in
human platelets.3,23 early studies on the functional
coupling of the  xxxg1879xxx  in the ncb-20 cells utilized
only a limited number of prostanoids.22 in addition, these
experiments measured adenylyl cyclase in vitro on ncb20 cell homogenates using radolabelled a[32p]-atp.
therefore, the major aim of the present studies was to
extend the pharmacological characterization of the ncb20  xxxg1879xxx  system using a functional readout of camp
production using a broad panel of prostanoids. this was
achieved using a direct measure of camp production, via
radioimmunoassay and enzyme immunoassay techniques, in an intact living cellular system. in addition, we
compared the functional potencies of a broad panel of
prostanoids obtained in the ncb-20 cells with their ip
receptor binding affinities determined using the endogenous receptor present on human platelets. through the
use of these two in vitro assay systems, the current
studies provide a detailed characterization of both
binding and functional responses for a broad range of
natural and synthetic prostanoid receptor agonists at the
endogenous ip receptors.

materials and methods

humidified atmosphere of 5% co2 and 95% air and fed
twice weekly.

 xxxd1773xxx  production in cultured cells
agonist-dependent  xxxd1773xxx  formation was measured
by a method described previously.24,25 upon reaching
confluence, the cells were rinsed twice with 0.5 ml of
dmem/f-12. the sample wells then were pre-incubated
for 20 min with dmem/f-12 containing 0.8 mm ascorbate
and 1.0 mm of the phosphodiesterase inhibitor 3-iso
butyl-1-methylxanthine ( xxxd2388xxx , sigma, st. louis, mo) at
room temperature (rt, b221c). prostanoid agonists were
added at the end of this period and the reaction was
allowed to proceed for 15 min. after aspiration of the
reaction medium, ice cold 0.1 m acetic acid (150 ml, ph
3.5) was added for the termination of camp synthesis and
cell lysis. finally, ice cold 0.1 m sodium acetate (225 ml,
ph 11.5–12.0) was added to neutralize the samples.

camp measurements
initial studies made use of [125i]-camp ria kits
purchased from biomedical technologies inc., (stoughton, ma). in later experiments we employed [125i]-camp
ria kits supplied by perseptive diagnostics, cambridge,
ma. this format used a secondary antibody, which
facilitated separation of bound and free camp by
vacuum filtration. sample manipulation and dilution,
camp standard curve preparation, antibody and [125i]camp additions were performed by a biomek 1000s
robot (beckman instruments, fullerton, ca) as previously described.25 bound [125i]-camp was measured
by gamma particle analysis. later experiments were
performed using an enzyme immunoassay supplied by
(eia, amersham pharmacia biotech, piscataway, nj).
this assay was conducted according to the package
insert in an automated manner using the biomek 2000
robot (beckman instruments, fullerton, ca). data from
the ria and eia methods gave comparable results,
therefore, the data were pooled.

tissue culture
national cancer bank (ncb-20) cells were maintained in
dulbecco’s modified eagle medium (dmem) containing
4.5 g/l glucose supplemented with 2% hat (a mixture of
sodium hypoxanthine, aminopterin, and thymidine),
2 mm glutamine, 10 mg/ml gentamicin, and 10% fetal
bovine serum. fetal bovine serum was supplied by
hyclone (logan, ut). media and other supplements were
products of life technologies (grand island, ny). the
cells were cultured in 48-well plates, maintained in a

 xxxg1879xxx  binding assays
frozen-thawed human platelet membranes (16 mg wet
weight tissue/tube final) dispersed in 50 mm tris-hcl
containing 10 mm  xxxd2534xxx  (ph 7.4) were incubated with
3 nm [3h]- xxxd2331xxx  to label the ip receptors.26 non-specific
binding was defined with 10 mm  xxxd2331xxx . the incubations
(60 min at 231c) were terminated by rapid vacuum
filtration (using whatman gf/b glass fiber filter previously soaked in 0.3% polyethyleneimine).

zk-118182 was a generous gift of schering ag (berlin and
bergkamen, germany) while rs-93520 was kindly provided by hoffman la-roche (basel, switzerland). carbaprostacyclin, pgi2,  xxxd2331xxx , 11-deoxy  xxxd124xxx , pge2,  xxxg1073xxx ,
 xxxd1902xxx , u46619,  xxxd1729xxx , fluprostenol, enprostil,
sq27986 and uf-021 were either synthesized by scientists in the medicinal chemistry department of alcon
research, ltd or purchased from cayman chemical co.
(ann arbor, mi).

analysis of data
all functional and binding data were expressed as mean
7sem. sample counts (cpm) were compared to the
standard curve and the camp content of each sample was
evaluated by linear regression analysis using the excels
(microsoft, redmond, wa) software package. potency
(ec50 and ic50) values were computed using a sigmoidal-fit function of the origins software package (microcal
software inc., northampton, ma).27 binding data were
analyzed by a non-linear, iterative, curve-fitting computer
program.26,28,29

a ki of 4.1 nm. prostanoid receptor agonists from the dp,
ep, fp and tp classes were weak inhibitors of [3h]- xxxd2331xxx

a bar chart exhibiting a variety of prostanoid receptor
ligands is shown in figure 2. compared to the ip ligand,
 xxxd2331xxx , agonists from the dp, ep, fp and tp classes were
much less effective at displacing [3h]- xxxd2331xxx  in human
platelet membrane preparations. these compounds all
inhibited [3h] agonist binding by less than 20%.
figure 3 illustrates several representative functional
concentration response curves for a range of prostanoid
agonists in the ncb-20 adenylyl cyclase assay. the ip
receptor ligands showed the greatest potency in this
system. response of the cells to  xxxg1879xxx  activation was
robust which suggested tight coupling to the adenylyl
cyclase enzyme. in addition, pge2, 11-deoxy  xxxd124xxx ,
misoprostol, and zk-118182 were full agonists in the
ncb-20 cells. enprostil and  xxxg1073xxx  did not achieve full
efficacy at the 100 mm concentration while uf-021 was

the current studies provide functional data for the ip
prostanoid receptor in an intact living cellular system, the
ncb-20 cell. conversely, blair and colleagues22 performed studies on adenylyl cyclase in vitro on ncb-20
cell homogenates using radolabelled a[32p]-atp. they
reported potency (ec50) values of 24.6 nm for pgi2 and
31 500 nm for pge2. our intact cell in vitro system
appeared to be more sensitive to  xxxg1879xxx  stimulation
with ec50 values of 7 nm and 3020 nm for the same two
compounds (see table 1). in addition, we have expanded
the work of blair et al.22 to include a number of synthetic
prostanoid receptor ligands. a high degree of selectivity
was exhibited by the  xxxg1879xxx . unfortunately, no  xxxg1879xxx  antagonists are available at this

prostanoid  xxxg1879xxx  pharmacology

time to selectively block the receptor and thus study the
pharmacological attributes of this system.
agonists from other prostanoid classes were weak or
inactive at stimulating adenylyl cyclase via the ip
prostanoid receptor in our ncb-20 cell test system. in
most cases, compounds with positive coupling to phospholipase c and thus phophoinositide turnover, such as
ep1, ep3, fp and  xxxg2253xxx  agonists, exhibited low
potency in this ip functional assay (table 1). this is not
surprising since the  xxxg1879xxx  shares only approximately 28% sequence homology with the  xxxg1878xxx , for
example.4 in studies with ncb-20 cells, blair and
colleagues (1980) reported ec50 values of 31 500 nm
and 4 100 000 nm for pge2 and  xxxd1902xxx , respectively.
these two agonists also produced low potencies of
3020 nm and 410 000 nm, respectively, in our experiments (table 1). the  xxxg1879xxx  shares a phylogenetic
subfamily of prostanoid receptors with the dp,  xxxg1873xxx  and
 xxxg1875xxx  receptors.11 this classification supports the data in
table 1, which show only the dp, ep, and  xxxg1879xxx 
agonists exhibit potencies o 10 000 nm.
human platelet membranes, which possess the native
 xxxg1879xxx , exhibited high affinity binding for
the  xxxg1879xxx  ligands competing for specific [3h] xxxd2331xxx  binding. our binding data corroborated and
expanded previously published results with this prostanoid receptor. for instance, cloned human ip receptors
expressed in cos-m6 cells showed an ic50 value of
4.0 nm4 for  xxxd2331xxx  compared with 4.1 nm ki in our
studies using human platelet preparations. similarly,
experiments by kiriyama et al.30 produced a ki value of
11 nm for  xxxd2331xxx  in cloned mouse ip prostanoid
receptors expressed in chinese hamster ovary (cho)
cells. a recent study using recombinant human ip
receptors expressed in human embryonic kidney (hek)
293 (ebna) cells reported ki values of 11 nm for  xxxd2331xxx 
and 283 nm for carbaprostacyclin31 which all compare
favorably to our observations of 4.1 nm and 368 nm
respectively for these two compounds in human platelet
membranes (see table 1).
compounds from the dp, ep, fp and  xxxg2253xxx  classes
were weak competitors of [3h]- xxxd2331xxx  binding. table 1
shows that, with the exception of 11-deoxy  xxxd124xxx , all
agonists from these prostanoid receptor classes produced
ki values 445 000 nm. these findings corroborate the
recent human recombinant  xxxg1879xxx  work of abramovitz and colleagues,31 which also showed prostanoid
receptor ligands such as sulprostone, misoprostol,
 xxxd1729xxx  and fluprostenol to have ki values
4100 000 nm.
the present studies provide a characterization of both
binding and functional responses for a large number of
natural and synthetic prostanoid receptor agonists at the
endogenous  xxxg1879xxx  in two different cellular systems.

these studies show a high degree of selectivity of the ip
receptor for agonists from that prostanoid class. this
works serves to broaden the scope of our understanding
of the pharmacolgy of the  xxxg1879xxx .
