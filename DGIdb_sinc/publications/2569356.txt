summary

selective histamine-hi receptor antagonists inhibit  xxxd81xxx 
(amp)-induced bronchoconstriction by >80% when expressed as a percentage
inhibition of the fev| time-response curve following inhalation of the provocation
concentration of amp required to produce a 20% decrease in fev| from baseline
(pcio). to investigate this further we have determined that, in eight mild atopic
asthmatic subjects,  xxxd3315xxx  (180 mg). administered 3 hr pre-challenge, increases the
geometric mean pc20 for histamine from 0 4 (range 0 03-3) mg/ml after placebo, to 20 2
(range 06-64) mg/ml following active treatment (/*<ooooi). for amp, the pc20
increased from 9-3 (range 10 113 3) mg/ml after placebo, to 150 2 (range 32-1-1177 7)
mg/ml with  xxxd3315xxx  (/*<00001). this 162-fold (range. 5-5-47-9) displacement to
the right of the amp concentration-response curve by a selective histamine-h| receptor
antagonist emphasizes the central role of histamine in the airways response to this
nucleotide.

introduction

adenosine and its nucleotide, adenosine 5' monophosphate (amp) cause dose-related bronchoconstriction
when inhaled by asthmatic subjects [i]. the 10-20-foid
protection afforded against amp by  xxxd1763xxx  and nedocromil sodium implicates the bronchial
mast cell in the nucleotide response [2]. in vitro, adenosine
potentiates the release of the preformed mediators,
histamine and ^-hexosaminidase, from rodent [3] and
human [4] mast cells. we have recently shown that the
selective histamine-hi receptor antagonists,  xxxd3315xxx 
and  xxxd236xxx , inhibit amp-induced bronchoconstriction by > s0% when expressed as percentage inhibition of
the forced expiratory volume in 1 sec (fevi)-timeresponse curve following inhalation of the provocation
concentration of amp required to produce a 20%
decrease in fev| from baseline (fc20) [5,6]. although
these data suggest that histamine is the mast cell mediator
responsible for the majority of the effects of amp on the

airways in asthmatic subjects, they do not allow direct
comparison ofthe potency of these drugs with mast cell
stabilizing agents. to gain further information on the
efficacy of  xxxd3315xxx  in inhibiting amp-induced bronchoconstriction we have compared the ability of this drug
to displace the concentration-response curves with histamine and amp in eight atopic asthmatic subjects.
subjects and methods

eight asthmatic subjects (six male, two female) with a
mean (s.e.m.) age of 28 (5-3) years, participated in the
study (table 1). all were non-smokers with a mean
baseline fevi of 97-1 ±6-3% of predicted values. the
subjects were atopic, as defined by positive immediate
skin-prick tests ( > 2 mm weal response) to two or more
common aero-allergens. all subjects had their asthma
controlled with inhaled /;f2-adrenoceptor agonists, either
alone or in combination with inhaled corticosteroids.
inhaled bronchodilators were withheld for 8 h prior to
each study period, and all provocation tests were carried
out at the same time of day. none of the subjects was
investigated within 4 weeks of an infective or allergen-

induced exacerbation of their asthma. subjects gave
written informed consent, and the study was approved by
ihe southampton university and hospitals ethical committee.
bronchial provocation
airway calibre, as the fevi. was measured before and
during the provocation, using a dry wedge spirometcr
(vitalograph®. buckinghamshire. u.k.), the first of two
consecutive measurements being used for analysis. on
each challenge day. hislamine acid phosphate ( xxxg257xxx 
chemicals. poole. u.k.) and  xxxd81xxx  (sigma chemical co.. poole. u.k.) were made up
in 0-9'!^. (w/v)  xxxd3213xxx  to produce a range of
increasing doubling concentrations of 003-16 mg/ml
(01-52 mmol/!). and 0 04-400 mg/ml ( i i 1151 4
mmol/1) respectively. the solutions were administered as
aerosols generated from a starting volume of 3 ml in a
disposable inspiron mini-nebulizer (cr bard international. sunderland, u.k.) driven by compressed air at a flow
rate of 8 1/min. under these conditions, the nebulizer
generated aerosol at a rate of 0 48 ml/min with a mass
medium particle diameter of 4 7 fim [7]. subjects inhaled
the aerosolized solutions in five breaths, from end tidal
volume to full inspiratory capacity, via a mouthpiece
[8.9].
study design
in the first phase, subjects attended on two occasions at

least 5 days apart to undertake concentration-response
studies with inhaled histamine, after they had received, in
randomized order and double-blind fashion, either oral
terfenadinc (180 mg) or matched placebo administered
3 hr pre-challenge. on each occasion, after 15 min rest,
three baseline measurements of fev; were recorded at
intervals of 3 min, followed by inhalation of nebulized
0-9% (w/v)  xxxd3213xxx  and repeat measurements of
f e v i at 1 and 3 min. provided fev| did not fall by
> 10% of the post-drug baseline value, the concentration-response study was undertaken. after inhalation of
each histamine concentration, fev, was measured at 1
and 3 min, the higher value being recorded. increasing
doubling concentrations of histamine were then inhaled
at 5 min intervals until fev, had fallen by >20% of the
post-saline value, or the highest concentration of histamine had been administered.
in the second phase of the study, subjects attended on
two further occasions at least 5 days apart to undertake
concentration response studies with inhaled amp, after
oral  xxxd3315xxx  or matched placebo, in a similar manner
to that for histamine.
at the end of each visit to the laboratory, a concentration-response study with histamine, 4 1 2 8 mg/ml
(13-416 mmoi/l) administered by skin-prick was performed. the total weal circumference  xxxd1891xxx  min with each
concentration of histamine was measured by computerassisted planimetry, and integrated to obtain weal area
[10].
data analysis
figures refer to the mean ± s.e.m. unless otherwise stated,
and the p<005 level of significance was accepted.
baseline fev| values after treatment with  xxxd3315xxx 
were compared with those after placebo by means of
student's /-test for paired data. as post-sa!ine fevi
values after  xxxd3315xxx  were significantly higher than
those after placebo, the agonist constrictor response was
expressed as a percentage of the post-drug baseline value
[11]. the decrease in fevi following each concentration
of agonist was expressed as a percentage of the higher of
the two post-saline baseline values. the response to each
concentration of agonist was defined as the higher of the
two fev, measurements recorded following inhalation
of that concentration. the percentage decrease in fevi
was plotted against the cumulative concentration of
agonist administered on a logarithmic scale, and the pc20
determined by linear interpolation. if a 20% fall in fev,
was not achieved with the highest cumulative concentration of agonist, then the provocation concentration was
estimated as one doubling concentration above the
highest cumulative concentration administered [12].

the slopes of the concentration-response curves were
determined by least squares linear regression analysis and
compared, between agonists, and for the same agonist
between post-placebo and post- xxxd3315xxx  study days,
using student's /-test for paired data. concentration
ratios for the protective effect of  xxxd3315xxx  against
bronchoprovocation with each agonist were calculated by
dividing the pc20 value obtained after administration of
active drug, by that obtained after placebo for the same
agonist. student's /-test for paired data was used to
compare the concentration ratios for histamine and
a m p , and the total skin weal areas with histamine for
each concentration on  xxxd3315xxx  and placebo study
days.
any relationship between pciu histamine and pc20

results
baseline values of f e v | between the two placebo study
days and the two  xxxd3315xxx  days were not significantly
different. however, baseline values of f e v | after administration of 180 mg of  xxxd3315xxx —mean (s.e.m.),
4-3 (0-4) and 4-3 (0-3) 1 on the two study days—were
significantly greater (/* < 0-01) than those after placebo—
3-9 (0-4) and 4-0 (0-3).
after oral placebo, the pc20 histamine ranged from
0-03 to 3-0 mg/ml. with a geometric mean of 0 4 mg/ml
(1-3 mmol/1) (table 2). for a m p . the pc20 ranged from

1-0 to 113-3 mg/ml with a geometric mean of 9-3 mg/ml
(26-8 mmol/1) (table 2). thus, on a molar basis. amp was
19-1-fold (range. 4-1-155) less potent than histamine in
provoking bronchoconstriction in this group of asthmatic
subjects.
after oral  xxxd3315xxx  (180 mg), the pc2() histamine
ranged from 0-6 to 64 mg/ml with a geometric mean of
20-2 mg/ml (65-8 mmol/1) (table 2). thus, this dose of
terfenadinc displaced the histamine concentration
response curve to the right in all eight subjects by 50-1 -fold
(i9-i-95-5) (p<0-0001). following premedication with
the same dose of  xxxd3315xxx , the pc2(i amp ranged from
32-1 t o l l 77-7mg/mlwithageometricmean of 150-2 mg/ml
(432-4 mmol/1) (table 2). thus, decreases in fev,
provoked by amp were prevented by  xxxd3315xxx  in all
eight subjects, and the concentration response curve was
displaced significantly (/*< 0-0001) to the right by 16-2fold (range 5 5 47-9) (fig. 1). the weal response to skinprick testing with histamine, 4-128 mg/ml (13-416 mmol/
i) was completely ablated on both  xxxd3315xxx  study days.

when expressed as the log pc20 values (r = 0-5. /* = 0-2).
there was a positive correlation between responsiveness
to each agonist measured as ihe baseline pc20 value and
the concentration ratio obtained after  xxxd3315xxx 
(r = 0 8 , / ' = 0-02; r = 0-6,/*< 0-1. for histamine and amp
respectively), and between the concentration ratios
obtained with the two provocants. although this was not
statistically significant (r = 0-63, f = 0-09). although there
was a strong relationship between the percentage increase
in baseline fev, between placebo and  xxxd3315xxx  study
days, and the concentration ratio for amp (r = 0-8.
/* = 0-01). there was no similar correlation between these
values for histamine (r = 0-4. p = 0-2).
discussion
the present data demonstrate that  xxxd3315xxx  (180 mg) is
highly potent in inhibiting the airways response to amp.
in affording a 16-fold protection against bronchoconstriction provoked by amp, these results confirm and
emphasi/e the significance of the >80% inhibition of the
area under ihc amp fev| lime curve observed with
 xxxd3315xxx  in previous studies [5,6]. since  xxxd3315xxx  is a
selective histamine-h| receptor antagonist, with no significant effects on the airways response to  xxxd2586xxx 
[5,6,13], and onlya small inhibitory effect on the response
to bradykinin [14], our present data strongly support a
mechanism for amp-induced bronchoconstriction involving histamine release from immunologically activated mast cells in the bronchial mucosa [5.6]. although
we observed a strong relationship between bronchodilation produced by  xxxd3315xxx  and protection against
amp. baseline changes in airway calibre are unlikely to
explain the 16-fold displacement to the right of the amp
concentration response curve observed in the present
study, as we have previously observed no similar inhibition of adenosine-induced decreases in pulmonary
function, by the anticholinergic agent ipratropium
bromide, despite similar significant bronchodilatation
[15].
current evidence strongly supports a central role for
the airway mast cell in the response to amp. /n vitro,
adenosine potentiates the release of /i-hexosaminidase
and histamine from the granules of immunoiogically
stimulated rodent [3] and human [4] mast cells, whilst
mast cell membrane stabilizing drugs are potent inhibitors of amp-induced bronchoconstriction in vivo [2]. as
sodium cromogtycate and nedocromil sodium protect
against the airways effects of bradykinin [16], but  xxxd3315xxx  has only a small inhibitory effect against this agonist
[14], our data suggest that these drugs are unlikely to
protect against amp by inhibiting activation of c-fibremediated neural reflexes [17]. that histamine is the mast

cell mediator most likely to be involved in mediating the
bronchoconstrictor response to amp, is suggested by the
recent demonstration of histamine release into bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and venous blood, in association
with decreases in pulmonary function provoked by
intravenous injection of adenosine and inhaled amp in
inbred rats [18] and atopie non-asthmatic human subjects
[19], respectively.
in conclusion, the present dala support a central role
for mast cell-derived histamine in mediating the airways
response to amp. and by implication, adenosine.
