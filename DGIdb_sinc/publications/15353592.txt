the t1r receptors, a family of taste-specific class c g proteincoupled receptors, mediate mammalian sweet and umami tastes.
the structure–function relationships of t1r receptors remain
largely unknown. in this study, we demonstrate the different
functional roles of t1r extracellular and transmembrane domains
in ligand recognition and g protein coupling. similar to other
family c g protein-coupled receptors, the n-terminal venus flytrap
domain of  xxxg2249xxx  is required for recognizing sweeteners, such as
aspartame and neotame. the g protein coupling requires the
transmembrane domain of  xxxg2249xxx . surprisingly, the c-terminal transmembrane domain of t1r3 is required for recognizing sweetener
cyclamate and sweet taste inhibitor lactisole. because t1r3 is the
common subunit in the sweet taste receptor and the umami taste
receptor, we tested the interaction of lactisole and cyclamate with
the umami taste receptor. lactisole inhibits the activity of the
human t1r1兾t1r3 receptor, and, as predicted, blocked the umami
taste of l-glutamate in human taste tests. cyclamate does not
activate the t1r1兾t1r3 receptor by itself, but potentiates the
receptor’s response to l-glutamate. taken together, these findings
demonstrate the different functional roles of t1r3 and  xxxg2249xxx  and
the presence of multiple ligand binding sites on the sweet taste
receptor.

a

family of class c g protein-coupled receptors (gpcrs),
t1rs, is selectively expressed in the taste buds (1–6).
functional expression of t1rs in human embryonic kidney
(hek)-293 cells revealed that different combinations of t1rs
respond to sweet and umami taste stimuli (6, 7).  xxxg2249xxx  and t1r3,
when coexpressed in hek-293 cells, recognize diverse natural
and synthetic sweeteners. similarly, t1r1 and t1r3, when
coexpressed in hek-293 cells, respond to the umami taste
stimulus l-glutamate. this response is enhanced by 5⬘ ribonucleotides, a hallmark of umami taste. recent experiments with
knockout mice confirmed that t1rs indeed mediate mouse
sweet and umami tastes (8, 9).
the class c gpcrs possess a large n-terminal extracellular
domain, often referred to as the venus flytrap domain (10), and
are known to function as either homodimers, in the cases of
metabotropic glutamate receptors (mglurs) and calciumsensing receptor, or heterodimers, in the case of ␥-aminobutyric
acid type b receptor (gababr) (10). the functional expression
data suggest a heterodimer mechanism for t1rs: both t1r1 and
 xxxg2249xxx  need to be coexpressed with t1r3 to be functional, which
is supported by the overlapping expression patterns of t1rs in
rodent tongue. nonetheless, there has been no direct evidence
that t1rs function as heteromeric complexes. it is possible that
t1r3 is not a functional component of sweet and umami taste
receptors, but merely a chaperone protein, which facilitates the
proper folding or intracellular translocation of t1r1 and  xxxg2249xxx .
the distinct ligand specificities of t1r1兾t1r3 and t1r2兾t1r3
receptors suggest that t1r1 and  xxxg2249xxx  play more important roles
in ligand binding in sweet and umami taste receptors than t1r3.
support for this hypothesis was provided recently by results from
mouse genetics where human  xxxg2249xxx  transgenic mice, generated
on the  xxxg2249xxx  knockout background, displayed sweetener taste
preferences similar to those of humans (9). however, the func14258 –14263 兩 pnas 兩 september 28, 2004 兩 vol. 101 兩 no. 39

tional role of t1r3 and the overall structure兾function relationship of t1r taste receptors remain largely unknown.
another intriguing observation about the t1r2兾t1r3 receptor is the structural diversity of its ligands. this receptor is able
to recognize every sweetener tested, including carbohydrate,
amino acids and derivatives, proteins, and synthetic sweeteners
(7). on the other hand, the receptor exhibits stereo-selectivity
for certain molecules. for example, it responds to  xxxd1794xxx 
but not l-tryptophan (7), which is in correlation with the sensory
data. it is still a puzzle as to how this single receptor can
recognize such a large collection of diverse chemical structures.
there are differences in human and rodent sweet taste in
terms of the ligand specificity, g protein-coupling efficiency, and
sensitivity to inhibitors. in this study, we use the species differences in t1r ligand specificity to demonstrate that the sweet
taste receptor indeed functions as a heteromeric complex, and
that there are likely more than one ligand binding sites on the
receptor. furthermore, we uncover a functional link between the
sweet and umami taste receptors mediated by t1r3.
materials and methods
t1r1兾t1r3 stable cell line. human t1r1兾t1r3-expressing stable

cell lines were generated by transfecting linearized peak10derived t1r1 and pcdna3.1兾zeo-derived (invitrogen) t1r3

37°c in glutamine-free dmem supplemented with glutamax,
10% dialyzed fbs, and 3 ␮g䡠ml⫺1 blasticidin. resistant colonies
were expanded, and their responses to umami taste stimuli were
evaluated by fluorescence microscopy.
constructs.  xxxg2249xxx  chimeras were constructed by introducing an
xhoi site with a silent mutation at human  xxxg2249xxx  amino acid 560
and rat  xxxg2249xxx  amino acid 564. t1r3 chimeras were constructed
by introducing xhoi sites with point mutations (human t1r3
a564e and rat t1r3 a569e). all chimeras were cloned into
peak10 expression vector. t1r mutants were generated by
using standard pcr-based mutagenesis protocol.
t1r assays. the t1r assays in transiently transfected cells were
performed as described (7). hek-293t and an hek-293 derivative that stably expresses g␣15 (invitrogen) were grown and

calcium-imaging experiments, cells were first seeded onto 48well tissue-culture plates (⬇30,000 cells per well) and transfected
by using mirus transit-293 (invitrogen). transfection efficiencies, which were estimated by cotransfection with a red fluorescent protein expression vector, were typically ⬇60%. to minimize variations, data reported in the same panel were obtained
on the same day by using the same batch of cell, which was
transfected under the same conditions. to minimize glutamateinduced and glucose-induced desensitization, supplemented
dmem was replaced with low-glucose dmem supplemented
with glutamax and 10% dialyzed fbs (invitrogen) ⬇24 h after
transfection. after an additional 24 h, cells were loaded with the
calcium dye fluo-4-am (molecular probes), 3 ␮m in dulbecco’s
pbs buffer (dpbs, invitrogen), for 1.5 h at room temperature.
after replacement with 100 ␮l of dpbs, stimulation was performed at room temperature by addition of 100 ␮l of dpbs
supplemented with taste stimuli. calcium mobilization was
monitored on an axiovert s100 microscope equipped with an
inverted ⫻10兾0.5 long working distance plano fluor objective
(zeiss) and a cooled charge-coupled device camera (princeton
instruments, trenton, nj). fluorescence images were acquired
at 480-nm excitation and 535-nm emission and analyzed with
imaging workbench 4.0 software (axon instruments, union
city, ca). t1r receptor activity was quantitated by counting the
number of responding cells 30 s after stimulus addition.
the stable t1r2兾t1r3- and t1r1兾t1r3-expressing cell lines
were manipulated as described (7). for calcium-imaging experiments, cells were seeded onto 48-well plates (⬇50,000 cells per
well) and incubated for 24 h. cells were then loaded with the
calcium dye fluo-4-am (molecular probes), 5 ␮m in pbs, for 1 h
at room temperature. after replacement with 100 ␮l of pbs,
stimulation was performed at room temperature by the addition
of 100 ␮l of pbs supplemented with stimuli.

the calcium dye fluo-4-am (molecular probes), 5 ␮m in pbs,
for 1 h at room temperature. after replacement with 50 ␮l of
pbs, stimulation was performed at room temperature by the
addition of 50 ␮l of pbs supplemented with taste stimuli. peak
fluorescence (480-nm excitation and 535-nm emission) responses ⬇20–30 s after compound addition were corrected for
and normalized to background fluorescence.
taste tests. detection threshold effects of lactisole on umami,

sweet, and salt taste were determined by tasting dilution series
of these taste stimuli in the presence and absence of lactisole as
described (11). detection threshold values were averaged over
four trials for three subjects.
results and discussion

mapping of ligand interaction sites on the sweet taste receptor. the

agonist specificities of human and rat t1r2兾t1r3 were previously characterized by functional expression of the receptors in
hek-293 cells. both human and rat sweet taste receptors can
efficiently couple to a chimeric g␣15 with the c-terminal tail
sequence from g␣i1 (g␣15/i1) (7). consistent with the sensory兾
behavioral data, human but not rat t1r2兾t1r3 selectively
responds to a group of sweeteners, including aspartame,
neotame, and cyclamate (7). these differences in agonist specificity can be used to map their binding sites on the receptor. we
generated chimeric t1rs between human and rat genes, with the
junction located immediately before the proposed transmembrane domain. each t1r chimera therefore consists of two
halves, the n-terminal extracellular domain and the c-terminal

combination generated a significantly weaker response to the control sweetener sucrose than did the wt receptors, possibly because of less than perfect
folding of the artificial receptor subunit. nonetheless, the same receptor
responds well to aspartame and neotame. because of the potential differences in folding, surface targeting, and coupling efficiency, we avoided
comparing the relative activities of different combinations. instead, we

c-terminal sequence. we transfected hek-293 cells with g␣15/i1
and different combinations of the chimeric receptors and tested
their responses to aspartame, neotame, and cyclamate (fig. 1).
through coexpression of t1r2r-h with human t1r3, we
replaced part of the human sweet taste receptor (the n-terminal
domain of  xxxg2249xxx ) with rat protein sequence, in which case, the
responses to aspartame and neotame are abolished, suggesting
the n-terminal domain of human  xxxg2249xxx  is required for recognizing aspartame and neotame. similarly, we can also replace the
rat  xxxg2249xxx  n-terminal domain with human protein sequence by
coexpressing t1r2h-r with rat t1r3, in which case the chimeric receptor gains the ability to respond to aspartame and
neotame. this finding suggests that the same domain of human
 xxxg2249xxx  is also sufficient (in the context of sweet taste receptors)
to enable activation by those two sweeteners (fig. 1b). these
functional expression data confirm the mouse genetics results
that  xxxg2249xxx  mediates the taste of some sweeteners (9) and further
indicate that the important interaction determinants for aspartame and neotame are located in the n-terminal extracellular
domain.
in contrast, replacing either half of human  xxxg2249xxx  with rat
protein sequence does not affect its response to cyclamate.
instead, the c-terminal domain of human t1r3 is required and
sufficient, when coexpressed with  xxxg2249xxx , to recognize cyclamate
(fig. 1c). the transmembrane domain of family c gpcrs has
been known to contain binding sites for allosteric modulators
(12). in this case, cyclamate binds directly to the transmembrane
domain and activates the receptor in the absence of another
ligand. recently, zhao et al. (9) described the taste behavior of
a transgenic mouse expressing human  xxxg2249xxx  in the background
of a mouse  xxxg2249xxx  knockout. although cyclamate was not tested,
based on our data, human t1r3 but not human  xxxg2249xxx  would be
expected to convey cyclamate preference to mouse taste.
lactisole, an aralkyl carboyxlic acid, is a human-specific sweet
taste inhibitor, which has no effect on the rodent sweet taste.
consistent with the behavioral observations, lactisole inhibits
the human, but not rat, t1r2兾t1r3 response to sucrose in our
assay system (fig. 1 a). we performed the same kind of mapping
experiments to determine the lactisol interaction site by using
the t1r chimeras. like cyclamate, lactisole requires the human
t1r3 c-terminal domain to inhibit the receptor’s response to
sucrose and acesulfame k (acek) (fig. 1d). this result further
demonstrates the importance of the t1r3 c-terminal domain in
the sweet taste receptor function. we tested the chimeras in all
16 possible combinations (fig. 6, which is published as supporting information on the pnas web site), and all functional
combinations generated results consistent with our model.
we conducted mutagenesis studies on both  xxxg2249xxx  and t1r3

aspartame, neotame, and cyclamate. if  xxxg2249xxx  and t1r3 are
responsible for recognizing different sweeteners, we would
expect mutations in the  xxxg2249xxx  n-terminal domain to affect

responses to aspartame and neotame, but not cyclamate. in
addition, we would predict mutations in t1r3 c-terminal domain to have the opposite effect. to select the crucial amino acid
residues in the  xxxg2249xxx  n-terminal domain, we aligned the sequence of  xxxg2249xxx  with  xxxg972xxx  (fig. 2a). among the eight
residues that are crucial in ligand binding in  xxxg972xxx  (13), three
are conserved in human  xxxg2249xxx  (s144, y218, and e302). we
mutated each of the three residues and tested the resulting
receptors for their response to different sweeteners. substitution
of y218 to a abolished the responses to all sweeteners tested
including cyclamate (data not shown). y218 might be important
for the overall conformation of the sweet taste receptor, but it
is also possible that that y218a failed to express or target to the
cell surface, considering that equivalent substitutions in  xxxg972xxx 
(14) and  xxxg976xxx  (15) led to partially functional receptors.
however, the two other human  xxxg2249xxx  variants, containing s144a
and e302a, selectively affected the response to aspartame and
neotame but not cyclamate. stable cell lines expressing s144a
and e302a human  xxxg2249xxx  variants (coexpressed with wt human
t1r3 and g␣15) did not respond to aspartame or neotame at the
physiologically relevant concentrations, but did respond to cyclamate (fig. 2b).
to further map the cyclamate-binding site, we focused on the
three extracellular loops in the t1r3 c-terminal domain. alignment of human and rodent t1r3s reveals multiple amino acid
differences in the three extracellular loops (fig. 2c). replacing
extracellular loop 2 or loop 3 with rat sequences abolished the
cyclamate response without affecting the sucrose or aspartame
responses. in contrast, replacing extracellular loop 1 had no
obvious effect on the response to cyclamate, suggesting impor-

tant roles for extracellular loops 2 and 3 in recognizing cyclamate
(fig. 2d). interestingly, none of those loop replacements affected the inhibition effect of lactisole (fig. 2d), suggesting a
different binding mechanism. in summary, amino acid substitutions in  xxxg2249xxx  or t1r3 result in selective interference of activities
induced by different sweeteners, consistent with the chimeric
receptor results.
taken together, the above results demonstrate that human
sweet taste receptor functions as a heteromeric complex of  xxxg2249xxx 
and t1r3. both subunits are required for recognizing different
sweeteners, and our data indicate the existence of multiple
binding pockets on the receptor for different classes of agonists.
the presence of multiple ligand-binding sites provides a possible
explanation for the structural diversity of sweeteners.
mapping of receptor–g protein interactions. the human and rat
sweet taste receptors are also different in their g proteincoupling efficiency. even though both human and rat receptors
can couple efficiently to g␣15/i1, only the human receptor can
couple efficiently to g␣15 (7) (fig. 3a). this species difference
allows us to map the receptor g protein interactions by using the
same chimeric receptors as described above.  xxxg2249xxx  but not t1r3
appears to be critical for g␣15 coupling, because replacing the c
terminus of human  xxxg2249xxx  with the corresponding rat sequence
abolished coupling, and replacing the rat  xxxg2249xxx  c-terminal half
with human sequence enabled the receptor to couple to g␣15
and respond to sucrose and acek (fig. 3). swapping the t1r3
c-terminal sequences had no effect on g␣15 coupling (fig. 3b).
this observation demonstrates the important role of  xxxg2249xxx  in g
protein coupling in our functional expression system. gustducin
(16) has been proposed to be an endogenous g protein for the
sweet taste receptor, and we speculate that  xxxg2249xxx  should be
the subunit responsible for coupling in taste cells. gababr is
the other example of heteromeric family c gpcr, where one
subunit ( xxxg827xxx ) is responsible for ligand binding, and the
other ( xxxg828xxx ) for g protein coupling (17–20). the sweet
taste receptor is different from gababr in that  xxxg2249xxx  is
required for both ligand recognition and g protein coupling.
lactisole antagonizes human t1r1兾t1r3 and inhibits human umami
taste. we reasoned that t1r1兾t1r3 may function as a het-

eromeric receptor just like t1r2兾t1r3, and that lactisole
should have a similar effect on t1r1兾t1r3 activity, because
14262 兩 www.pnas.org兾cgi兾doi兾10.1073兾pnas.0404384101

t1r3 is a common subunit between the two receptors. consistent with this logic, we found that lactisole antagonizes
human t1r1兾t1r3 (fig. 4a). lactisole acts as a noncompetitive inhibitor of t1r1兾t1r3, because the ic50 values apparently do not depend on glutamate concentration (fig. 4b), and
lactisole reduces the maximal activities of the receptor without
significantly changing the ec50 of agonists (fig. 4c). these
results demonstrate that lactisole binds to a different site from
l-glutamate and are consistent with our hypothesis that the
glutamate-binding pocket is located in t1r1 (7). interestingly,
lactisole appears to be a competitive inhibitor of the sweet
taste receptor, as its ic50s depend on the concentrations of the
sweeteners, and it increases the ec50s of the sweeteners
without significantly affecting the maximal activities (fig. 6).
further investigation is needed to explain the apparent difference in its inhibition patterns for the sweet and umami taste
receptors.
the inhibition effect of lactisole is mediated by the t1r
receptors because it had no effect on the endogenous muscarinic
acetylcholine receptor in hek cells or on a mouse bitter
receptor, mouse t2r5, transiently expressed in hek cells (data
not shown). as was the case for the t1r2兾t1r3 receptor,
lactisole inhibition of the t1r1兾t1r3 response to umami taste
stimuli was reversible after washout and restimulation (data not
shown).
to correlate the receptor activity with behavior, we tested the
effect of lactisole on human umami taste. as we predicted,
millimolar concentrations of lactisole dramatically increased
detection thresholds for sweet and umami but not salt taste
stimuli (fig. 4d). lactisole was previously not known to be an
umami taste inhibitor. the correlation between receptor activity
and taste results demonstrates a crucial role of t1rs in human
umami taste.
cyclamate enhances human t1r1兾t1r3 receptor activities. based on
the same heteromeric model of t1rs (fig. 5), we predicted that
cyclamate would also modulate the activity of the human t1r1兾
t1r3 umami taste receptor by acting on t1r3. although
cyclamate alone had no effect on t1r1兾t1r3, it enhanced the
activity of the receptor in the presence of l-glutamate (fig. 4e).

taste receptor. because t1r3 is the common subunit in the sweet
and the umami taste receptors, we predicted and confirmed the
effect of cyclamate and lactisole on the umami taste receptor.
furthermore, we were able to correlate the lactisole effect on the
receptor activities with human taste. based on these observations, we propose a working model (fig. 5) for the structure–
function relationships of the t1r family of taste receptors. we
speculate that natural carbohydrate sweeteners bind to the
n-terminal domain of  xxxg2249xxx , similar to aspartame and neotame,
and there may be other ligand-binding sites on the sweet taste
receptor, for example, the transmembrane domain of  xxxg2249xxx . the
umami taste receptor most likely functions similarly as a heteromeric complex, and we speculate that l-glutamate and imp
each bind to the t1r1 subunit, because neither has any effect on
the sweet taste receptor (7) (data not shown), and that the
transmembrane domain of t1r1 is responsible for coupling to g
proteins.

is noteworthy that cyclamate has comparable ec50s for the sweet
taste receptor (fig. 2b) and umami taste receptor. cyclamate
reproducibly left-shifts the dose–response curves for l glutamate by ⬇2-fold in the presence or absence of imp (fig.
4f). imp has a more dramatic effect of enhancing the receptor,
and the effect of cyclamate is observed in the presence of imp
(fig. 4f), suggesting a different mechanism from imp in enhancing the receptor. we speculate that imp binds to t1r1,
because it has no effect on the sweet taste receptor (7). other
sweeteners, including sucrose, aspartame, saccharin, and dtryptophan, had no effect on the human t1r1兾t1r3 activities
(data not shown). because of the intense sweet taste of cyclamate, we could not determine its effect on umami taste.
in summary, we demonstrate that both  xxxg2249xxx  and t1r3 are
required in a functional sweet taste receptor, that aspartame and
neotame require the n-terminal extracellular domain of  xxxg2249xxx ,
that g protein coupling requires the c-terminal half of  xxxg2249xxx ,
and that cyclamate and lactisole require the transmembrane
domain of t1r3. these findings demonstrate the different
functional roles of t1r subunits in a heteromeric complex and
the presence of multiple sweetener interaction sites on the sweet
