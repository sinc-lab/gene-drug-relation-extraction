intrathecal  xxxg81xxx  agonist attenuates hyperalgesia without inhibiting spinal glutamate release in the rat.  the analgesia effects of intrathecal  xxxg81xxx  agonist, r-pia, on the hyperalgesia and csf-glutamate release after formalin injection into the rat paw were evaluated. r-pia significantly and dose-dependently attenuated increases in flinching behavior, and this attenuating effect was reversed by the  xxxg81xxx  antagonist,  xxxd150xxx . morphine blocked flinchs, however mk-801 partially abolished. the increase in csf-glutamate release evoked by formalin stimulation was inhibited by morphine but not by either r-pia or mk-801. these findings suggest that the intrathecal  xxxg81xxx  agonist provokes analgesic effect via the postsynaptic action independent of an effect upon spinal glutamate release.
