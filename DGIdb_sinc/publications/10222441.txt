an ethopharmacological assessment of the effects of  xxxd3568xxx  on agonistic interactions in male mice.   xxxd3568xxx  is a thioxanthene derivative which acts as a mixed dopamine d1/ xxxg656xxx  antagonist. although the antiaggressive action of neuroleptic drugs is well known, the effects of  xxxd3568xxx  on agonistic interactions have not been explored and there are no studies comparing acute and subchronic effects of this compound on aggression in rodents. in this work, we examined the action of  xxxd3568xxx  (0.025-0.4 mg/kg), administered acutely or subchronically for 10 days, on agonistic behavior elicited by isolation in male mice. individually housed mice were exposed to anosmic "standard opponents" 30 min after the drug administration, and encounters were videotaped and evaluated using an ethologically based analysis. after acute treatment,  xxxd3568xxx  (0.2 and 0.4 mg/kg)-treated animals exhibited ethopharmacological profiles characterized by a decrease in offensive behaviors without impairment of motor activity (0.2 mg/kg). in contrast, the antiaggressive action of the highest dose used (0.4 mg/kg) was accompanied by a marked increase of immobility. after subchronic treatment, no tolerance to  xxxd3568xxx  antiaggressive or motor activity was observed. overall, this behavioral profile is similar to that observed with other typical neuroleptics.
