abstract
the binding characleristics of the angiotensin at 1 receptor antagonist- xxxd3487xxx  were investigated in different animal
species and tissues. u,;ing [125i](sarl,iles) xxxg99xxx  as radioligand, affinity constants were determined in liver and
adrenal of rat and marmoset, human adrenal and in rat aortic smooth muscle cells. in all tissues tested,  xxxd3487xxx  had a
greater affinity for the at 1 receptor than losartan (on average 5-fold). the affinities of both antagonists were up to 30 times
weaker in the dog tissues. [3h] xxxd3487xxx  bound with high affinity ( g d 1.44 nmol/l) to the rat aortic smooth muscle cell at 1
receptor. binding was ,;aturable and reversible. non-specific binding was low (10%). reports that [3h]losartan binds to a
non- xxxg99xxx  binding site in rat liver and in other tissues could be confirmed. [3h] xxxd3487xxx  on the other hand bound
only to the at 1 recepto:r. using a competition binding assay with [3h]losartan on rat liver membranes it could be shown that
 xxxd3487xxx  can bind to the 'losartan binding site', but at a 10,000-fold less affinity than for the at 1 receptor.  xxxd3487xxx  is
therefore a highly specific and selective antagonist of the at 1 receptor. due to its high affinity and low non-specific binding
it is a suitable radioactive antagonist for the study of the distribution and function of the angiotensin at 1 receptor.

1. introduction
the angiotensin 1i (ang ii) receptor has been
clearly differentiated into two main types, at~ and
at 2, based on ligand selectivity, transductional and
structural criteria [1]. virtually all known effects of
ang ii are mediated by the a t 1 receptor. however,
binding and pharmacological studies have demonstrated heterogeneity of ang ii receptors in different
tissues and species [2-8]. moreover, expression
cloning of the receptor has allowed the distinction of

subtypes amongst the a t 1 receptor family. in mouse
and rat, the atia is predominant in vascular tissues
whereas the atib is mainly expressed in adrenal and
pituitary gland [9]. the difference between r a t / m o u s e
at1a and atib involves only 18 amino acid substitutions, mainly in the c-terminal portion and the two
subtypes have 96% identity [10]. they are however
regulated differently. for example, oestrogen lowered the  xxxg100xxx  m r n a expression in pituitary but did
not affect the atia [11]. also, treatment with ang ii
antagonist down-regulated both atia and atib
m r n a in rat heart and aorta, but only a t m was
significantly reduced in adrenal [11,12]. furthermore, dietary sodium deprivation enhanced the atib
m r n a expression in rat brain whereas a high sodium

diet increased levels of atia mrna [13]. moreover,
evidence is emerging that selective changes in ang
ii receptor subtypes occur in cardiovascular disease
[14-16].
bovine, canine and human at 1 receptor have
been reported to be coded by a single gene [17-21],
although it has recently been proposed that human
placenta and heart express two different isoforms of
at 1 receptor [22].
so far, the binding signature of the cloned rat
at1a,  xxxg100xxx  and human at 1 transfected into chinese
hamster ovary cells (cho) could not be distinguished using a great variety of non-peptidic ligands
[23,24]. however, a drop of up to 35-fold in affinity
for losartan has been reported in bovine adrenal
although there is a 95% homology between rat,
bovine and human at 1 receptor [23]. more recently,
a low affinity for losartan has been observed in cos
cells expressing canine at 1 receptor and burns et al.
hypothesised that a single mutation in position 163 is
responsible for this decreased affinity [18]. this was
confirmed by ji et al. using mutant rat at~ in which
non-conserved amino acids were replaced by the
corresponding amphibian residues [25].
whereas the natural ligand ang ii binds with
equal affinity to both at1 and at 2, the availability
of selective non-peptidic ligands has made possible
the development of selective and more stable radioligands for biochemical and pharmacokinetic studies
of the ang i! subtypes. the use of radioactive losartan was therefore thought to be an invaluable tool for
broadening our understanding of the distribution and
heterogeneity of the ang ii receptor [26,27]. unfortunately, two recent reports have indicated that
[3h]losartan recognizes not only the  xxxg100xxx  in
the rat liver, but also binds with high affinity to an
even larger population of sites (80%) which are
apparently unrelated to ang ii and which remain
uncharacterized [28,29]. moreover, at high concentrations, losartan binds to a thromboxane/ xxxd1902xxx 
receptor on platelets [30] and inhibits a bovine brain

the great heterogeneity of the receptor in various
species and tissues and the possible existence of an
additional non-ang ii binding site for losartan
prompted us to verify the binding properties of  xxxd3487xxx , a specific ang ii antagonist [32], which dif-

2.1. materials

[125i](sar1,ile8)ang ii was obtained from anawa,
wangen, switzerland.  xxxd3487xxx  and losartan were
synthesized at ciba-geigy. [3h] xxxd3487xxx  (80
c i / m m o l ) was synthesised by ciba-geigy.
[3h]losartan was from dupont nen. tissues were
frozen immediately on dry ice and held at -80°c
until used. human adrenals were obtained during
surgery.

adrenal cortex and liver tissue was homogenized
in 20 mmol/l sodium bicarbonate with a polytron

and centrifuged at 600 g for 20 min at 4°c. the
supernatant was spun at 60,000 g for 20 min and the
pellet resuspended in incubation buffer: 50 mm trishc1 ph 7.4, containing 125 mmol/1  xxxg2020xxx , 6.5
mmol/1 mgc12 and 1 mmol/1 edta using a tightly
fitting teflon-pestle homogenizer. a cocktail of proteinase inhibitors (antipain,  xxxd2936xxx , leupeptin and  xxxd3463xxx , each at 1.25 ~ g / m l ) was added.
rat aortic smooth muscle cells (smc) (harvested
using a rubber policeman and suspended in phosphate buffered saline [pbs]) were homogenized in
20 m m o l / l sodium bicarbonate and centrifuged at
60,000 g for 30 min. the pellet was resuspended in
the same buffer as for the tissue membranes. protein
concentration was measured according to the method
of bradford [33] using the pierce reagent and bovine
 xxxg124xxx  as standard.

(losartan) or 2 h ( xxxd3487xxx ). in all experiments, the
bound fraction was less than 10% of total. k i values
were calculated according to the cheng-prusoff
equation [35]. kinetic parameters were calculated
using the programs kinetic and ligand (biosoft, cambridge, uk). the results are expressed as
the mean _+ s.e.m. a one-way analysis of variance
was performed and multiple comparisons were made
using the kruskal-wallis procedure for populations
with unequal variances [36]. p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.

2.3. binding assays

binding affinities of (sarl,ile8)ang ii,  xxxd3487xxx 
and losartan were determined in membranes prepared from adrenal cortex and liver of rat, dog and
marmoset (table 1). for comparison, values were
also determined in human adrenal and rat aortic
smc membranes. the affinity of (sarl,iles)ang ii
varies between tissues and species by no more than a
factor of 6, being the highest in marmoset liver and
the lowest in rat adrenal. no significant difference in
affinity was found in liver of the different species or
between rat aortic smc and the values of the other
tissues and species taken together. there was a
significant difference in affinity for (sarl,ile8)ang ii
between rat and dog adrenal on the one hand and

membrane protein was incubated with 175 pmol/1
[125i](sarl,iles)ang l i _ unlabeled competitors for 2

receptors were blocked by 0.1 /zmol/1 cgp42112b
[34]. the reaction was terminated by immediate filtration through whatman g f / f filters, which were
washed twice with 4 ml cold pbs. non-specific
binding was determined in the presence of 1 /zmol/1
unlabeled ang ii. [3h] xxxd3487xxx  and [3h]losartan
were incubated at 2-3 and 10-20 nmol/1, respectively, with 25-75 ~g membrane protein for 30 min

analysis of variance indicates that the ics0 values for (sarl,lles)ang ii,  xxxd3487xxx  and losartan for all tissues come from a population with

marmoset and human on the other ( p < 0.05). the
mean ratio of the ic50 values of  xxxd3487xxx  versus
(sarl,iles)ang ii was 3.0 in the rat, marmoset and
human tissues, and around 25 in the dog. the equivalent values for losartan were 13.9 and 120. the
ratio losartan/ xxxd3487xxx  was fairly constant (4.68 _
0.41), demonstrating the consistency in potency difference between losartan and  xxxd3487xxx .
these results indicate that the peptide
(sarl,ile8)ang ii is able to detect some degree of
heterogeneity of the at a receptor in various species.
this heterogeneity between species is even more
marked when the non-peptidic antagonists  xxxd3487xxx 
and losartan are used. although there is no significant difference in affinity for  xxxd3487xxx  and losartan
between rat and marmoset adrenal and liver, the dog
tissues have the highest ic50, indicating a decreased
affinity for the two antagonists. taking the rat aortic

smc as a reference, the affinities of  xxxd3487xxx  and
losartan for the dog adrenal receptor were respectively 24- and 34-fold lower. a similar observation
was also made in liver, but the difference was less
pronounced. in all of the tissues tested, the affinity
of  xxxd3487xxx  for the at~ receptor was between 3 and
6 times greater than that of losartan.

3.2. binding studies with [3h]non-peptidic antagonists
kinetics of [3h] xxxd3487xxx  binding to rat aortic
smooth muscle cells (fig. 2)
binding of [3h] xxxd3487xxx  to smooth muscle cell
membranes reached a steady state within 90 min and
was stable for up to 3 h (k+i 11.27 _+ 3.15 × 1 0 6
mo1-1 min-1; tl/2 18.2_+3.4 min). dissociation
was initiated by adding 10 tzmol/l unlabeled  xxxd3487xxx  at 60 min. the dissociation rate constant ( k 1)
was 0.0121_+0.0016 min-1; tl/2 56_+ 7 min (all
values _+ s.e.m., n = 4). the mean k d from the
four experiments was 1.44 _+ 0.48 nmol/l. typical
cpm values at 2 h were 1000 for total binding and
100 for non-specific. the mean k d determined from
saturation experiments was 1.95 n m o l / l (n = 2; fig.
2 lower panel).
binding of [3h]valsartun and [3h]losartan to liver
membranes
[3h] xxxd3487xxx  bound to liver membranes from rat
and marmoset with high affinity ( k d 1.7 and 2.2
nmol/1, respectively). in competition experiments,
(sarl,ile8)ang ii totally displaced radioactive  xxxd3487xxx  from its binding site with a k i value of 0.63
nmol/l, similar to the affinity obtained using
(sarl,ile8)ang ii as tracer (fig. 3a).
tritiated losartan bound to rat liver membranes
with an apparent k d of 9 nmol/l. however, an
excess of (sarl,ile8)ang ii was unable to displace
[3h]losartan by more than 20% (fig. 3b). this suggests that, in contrast to  xxxd3487xxx , losartan in rat
liver membranes binds with high affinity to a site
which is not recognized by (sarl,ile8)ang ii. to
exclude a tissue or species selective effect, similar
binding experiments were performed with liver and
adrenal membranes prepared from marmoset (fig.
3c,d). again, radioactive losartan was not totally

in the presence of an excess of unlabeled ligand, the remaining radioactivity was typically 15% for  xxxd3487xxx  and 30% for losartan.
radioactive losartan was not totally displaced by an excess of (sarl,iles)ang ii (83 and 70% inhibition in rat and marmoset liver,
respectively).

shown).

the binding affinity of  xxxd3487xxx  to the 'losartan
binding site' was determined in a competition assay

ang ii (1 /zmol/l) to block the at 1 receptor (fig.

in agreement with previous studies, our competition binding data support the concept of at 1 subtype
tissue and species heterogeneity. dog at 1 receptors
appear to bind non-peptidic antagonists with much
lower affinity than receptors in rat, marmoset or
human. furthermore, there is a significant difference
between ic50 in dog liver and adrenal. this difference is not observed between liver and adrenal collected from other species. on average,  xxxd3487xxx  has
a 5-fold greater affinity for the rat, dog, marmoset
and human tissues than losartan. if it is accepted that
the liver expresses the at1a subtype and the adrenal

the atib, then both  xxxd3487xxx  and losartan are unable
to distinguish between the two isomers, confirming
that the ligand binding signatures are essentially
identical [23]. however, (sarl,iles)ang ii appears
able to differentiate between rat (and dog) adrenal
and liver. this is in contrast to the report by chiu et
al. [23], who did not observe any difference between
the k i of (sarl,ile8)ang ii for rat atia and atib
expressed in cho cells. the difference, although
statistically significant, is probably without biological significance. it is not excluded, however, that
non-peptide antagonists could be synthesized which
bind preferentially to the ang ii receptor expressed
in a particular species [10].
in rat and marmoset liver, tritiated  xxxd3487xxx  binds
with high affinity and high specificity to a single
binding site, as observed in a competitive binding
study with unlabeled  xxxd3487xxx  and (sarl,iles)ang ii.
in rat aortic smooth muscle cell membranes the
binding of  xxxd3487xxx  is reversible and the k d values
measured in kinetic, saturation and competition binding experiments are similar (1.4, 1.9 and 2.4 nmol/l,
respectively). association and dissociation rates of
[3h] xxxd3487xxx  01/2 18 and 56 minutes, respectively)
were much slower than those of [3h]losartan (both
less than 5 min) ([26] and own observations), thereby
necessitating longer incubation times when using
[3h] xxxd3487xxx . with smooth muscle cell membranes,
non-specific binding was always about 10%, with
adrenal and liver membranes 15-20%. non-specific
binding with [3h]losartan under identical conditions
was always about twice these values. dithiothreitol
fully inhibits binding of [3h] xxxd3487xxx  as characteristically observed for the at 1 receptor (data not shown)
[35]. [3h] xxxd3487xxx  binding is totally displaceable by
(sarl,iles)ang ii, indicating that  xxxd3487xxx  binds only
to the at 1 receptor. these findings suggest that
 xxxd3487xxx 's effect on blood pressure is mediated entirely through the at x ang ii receptor.
[3h]losartan on the other hand binds additionally
to a site which is not recognized by (sarl,ile8)ang
ii. when the rat liver at 1 receptor was blocked
using ang ii, it could be shown in a competitive
binding assay using [3h]losartan that  xxxd3487xxx  also
binds to the 'losartan binding site', but at a 220-fold
lesser affinity than losartan itself and at a concentration more than 10,000 times the k d of  xxxd3487xxx  at
the at 1 receptor.

the site appears to be quite widely distributed,
but its function and significance is not yet known
[27,28]. there appears to be fewer of these sites in
the adrenal than in the liver [27]. our own observations suggest that the site is present in rat and
marmoset liver, marmoset adrenal and in rat aortic
smooth muscle cells. in contrast, chiu et al. were
unable to find this additional site in rat adrenal
cortical microsomes or in aortic smooth muscle cells
[25]. chansel et al. reported finding the site in kidney
glomeruli and mesangial cells [37]. it has been
demonstrated (by hplc analysis of free and bound
hormone following incubation with liver homogenates) that this binding site is not an artefact
due to metabolism of [3h]losartan [27]. losartan
could bind to another part of the at 1 receptor
molecule without interfering with the peptide binding site. both  xxxd3487xxx  and losartan contain the
biphenyl tetrazole moiety, but  xxxd3487xxx  differs in the
substitution of the imidazole by a n-acylated valine
residue. it is therefore possible that this imidazole
recognizes a different site on the receptor protein
than the valine of  xxxd3487xxx . it has not been reported
so far that losartan has an affinity for the imidazolidine binding site, but it has been described to be, at
high concentrations, an antagonist of the human
platelet thromboxane a2/prostaglandin h 2 receptor
and an inhibitor of camp phosphodiesterase [29,30].
this finding is probably irrelevant for the clinic as
the concentrations required are well above the plasma
levels measured in patients [38]. surprisingly, the
losartan specific binding site in the liver has not been.
detected with other radiolabeled ang ii antagonists
such as a 81988, exp 985, l 158,809, mk-996,
sk&f 108566 and lf 7-0156 [26,39-43]. these
last two compounds lack the biphenyl moiety.  xxxd3487xxx  and a 81988, are di-acidic molecules whereas
losartan with a neutral alcohol, exp 985, mk-996
and l158,809 are mono-acidic molecules. a convincing explanation for the difference in binding of
these various ang ii antagonists is still missing.
spatial overlap of the c-terminal pentapeptide
part of (sarl,ile8)ang ii with  xxxd3487xxx  or sk&f
108566 has been performed [44,45]. it has been
proposed that the acylated amino acid of  xxxd3487xxx 
mimics the c-terminus and the phenyl-tetrazole part
coincides with the phenol moiety of (tyr 4) of ang
ii. similarly, weinstock et al. reported that the acrylic

m. de gasparo, s. whitebread/ regulatory peptides 59 (1995) 303-311

acid carboxyl and thienyl group of sk&f 108566
align with the corresponding elements of phe 8 and
the 2-butyl lies in the hydrophobic region near ile 5
of ang ii [45]. although the acidic group mimics a
similar interaction of the c-terminal carboxyl group
of ang ii with its receptor, modeling studies of
losartan indicated that it does not adopt the same
binding mode as sk&f 108566 [46]. structure-activity studies with the computer-assisted modeling
approach are, however, difficult since the three-dimensional structure of the at 1 receptor is unknown.
moreover, there is much disagreement over the conformation of the endogenous ligand itself. recently,
a comparison of the epitopes involved in the interaction of the at 1 receptor with selected non-peptide
antagonists was performed using hybrids of the human receptor and corresponding segments from a
homologous xenopi'~s laevis receptor [47,48]. the
amphibian receptor differs from the mammalian as it
does not bind the non-peptidic compounds [49,50].
in this model, non-peptidic ligands appear to bind to
overlapping, but dis~tinct, sites located in transmembrane segments vi and vii. moreover, it was possible to distinguish insurmountable and competitive
antagonists. in contrast to losartan,  xxxd3487xxx  is an
insurmountable antagonist when tested in isolated
rabbit aortic rings [32]. the use of such hybrid
constructs could be helpful to explain subtle differences between non-peptidic at 1 antagonists which
may differ in their ill: with the receptor configuration.
more genetic engineering of the at 1 receptor is
therefore required for a better understanding of the
topography of the interaction between the receptor
and the various antagonists available.
in conclusion, wllsartan has a high affinity and
selectivity for the at 1 receptor. when tritiated, it is
a suitable and potertt radioactive antagonist for the
study of the distribution and function of the ang ii
 xxxg100xxx .
