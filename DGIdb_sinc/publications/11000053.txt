increased homocyst(e)ine associated
with smoking, chronic inflammation,
and aging may reflect acute-phase
induction of  xxxg1721xxx 
activity

summary smokers, patients with chronic inflammatory disorders, and the elderly, are characterized by increased
production of il-6 as well as increased plasma levels of homocyst(e)ine. analysis of cirrhotic livers suggests that il-6
may stimulate the activity of  xxxg1721xxx  in hepatocytes, thereby diminishing  xxxd3047xxx  levels,
compromising  xxxg350xxx  activity, and raising plasma homocyst(e)ine. adequate supplemental intakes of
pyridoxine may be corrective in this regard. © 2000 harcourt publishers ltd

smoking, inflammation, and aging
increase homocyst(e)ine
smoking, chronic inflammatory disorders such as
rheumatoid arthritis and lupus, as well as aging, have in
common the following: increased production and serum
levels of interleukin-6 (il-6) (1–17); decreased plasma levels of  xxxd3047xxx  (plp) (18–27); and increased
plasma levels of homocyst(e)ine (hcy) (28–36). i propose
that these phenomena are mechanistically linked.
the predominant source of plasma plp is believed to
be the liver (37). on the reasonable presumption that
plasma alkaline phosphatase activity is not markedly
altered in the conditions under consideration, a low
plasma plp level is likely to be indicative of a low concentration of plp in hepatocytes. hepatic activity of  xxxg350xxx  (cbetas) is an especially crucial
determinant of circulating hcy levels, particularly as the

majority of hcy is generated in the liver, in the process of
creatine synthesis (38,39). the affinity of this enzyme for
plp is not high (km ≅ 60 µm) (40) in relation to normal
hepatocyte concentrations of this cofactor (≅30 µm in
rats) (41–43), thus, a reduction in hepatocyte plp can be
expected to impair cbetas activity and thereby raise plasma
hcy levels. this view is consistent with studies demonstrating an inverse correlation of plasma levels of hcy
and plp in various populations (34,44–47). the reduction
in plasma plp observed in smokers, patients with chronic
inflammation, and in the elderly, is therefore likely to be
associated with a deficit of hepatic cbetas activity that may
be responsible for the elevation of plasma hcy seen in
these subjects.
interleukin-6 may mediate this effect by
modulating pyridoxine metabolism
but why are hepatocyte plp levels low in these circumstances? since il-6 has a marked impact on hepatocyte
function (48–51), and its plasma levels are elevated in
smokers, patients with chronic inflammation, and the
aged – in conjunction with decreased plasma plp – it is

reasonable to suspect that il-6 is the mediator of this
disruption of hepatocyte pyridoxine metabolism.
unfortunately, there do not appear to be any published studies evaluating the impact of il-6 (or other
cytokines) on hepatocytes vis à vis pyridoxine metabolism. however, there is evidence pertaining to pyridoxine
metabolism in the hepatocytes of patients with cirrhosis
– a disorder in which hepatocytes are exposed to greatly
increased concentrations of il-6 and other cytokines,
owing to chronic activation of kuppfer cells (52–56).
merrill and colleagues measured the activities of
enzymes of pyridoxine metabolism in liver biopsies of
patients with cirrhosis as well as other liver disorders (57).
the activities of enzymes which activate pyridoxine –
namely  xxxg1720xxx  and pyridoxine-5-phosphate
oxidase – did not differ between cirrhotics and other
patients. however,  xxxg1721xxx  activity was markedly higher in the cirrhotics (9.55 vs 3.97 nmol/min/mg
protein). pyridoxal oxidase (which irreversibly catabolizes
 xxxd3049xxx ) was actually slightly lower in the cirrhotics
than the other patients. thus, the reduction of plasma
plp characteristically seen in cirrhosis appears to be
attributable to a substantial elevation of hepatic plp
phosphatase activity. i propose that il-6 (and possibly
other kuppfer cell-derived cytokines) mediates this
increase in activity, and that a similar phenomenon is
elicited by the increased il-6 production associated with
smoking, chronic inflammation, and aging.
merrill also reports that a supplemental intake of 25 mg
pyridoxine daily is capable of normalizing plasma plp levels in cirrhotics, presumably owing to a compensatory
increase in hepatocyte plp synthesis (58). i predict that,
analogously, such supplementation will normalize plp status in smokers, patients with chronic inflammation, and
the elderly, and thereby diminish their moderately elevated hcy levels. since the vascular risk associated with
plasma hcy has been found to increase throughout the
normal range of hcy concentrations (59), and since hcy
is likely to be a mediator of this risk (rather than merely a
marker for other pathogenic factors) (60,61), reduction of
even moderate elevations of hcy with supplemental pyridoxine may have a worthwhile impact on health.
consistent with this theory, some (though not all) (62)
studies indicate that plasma hcy correlates directly with
plasma levels of the acute-phase reactants fibrinogen, creactive protein, and alpha-1-antichymotrypsin (63–65) –
all induced by il-6 activity on hepatocytes. thus, it may be
feasible to view hcy as an acute-phase reactant – although,
inasmuch as many other factors can influence hcy levels,
an elevation of hcy by no means implies an acute-phase
reaction, and the correlations between hcy and classical
acute-phase reactants cannot be expected to be very tight.
relevant to this view is evidence that plasma plp levels
plummet following myocardial infarction (mi). in one of the
medical hypotheses (2000) 55(4), 289–293

first efforts to correlate pyridoxine status with cardiovascular risk, south african researchers measured plasma plp in
patients hospitalized for a recent mi, and found that they
were only about 50% as high as those of healthy controls –
leading to the suggestion that plp was a potent cardiovascular risk factor (66,67). however, subsequent studies
revealed that plp levels were only slightly decreased relative to healthy controls in patients with stable coronary disease, and that plp levels gradually rose to the normal range
in mi patients prior to hospital discharge (67–69). there is
now ample evidence that, in the days following an mi, an
acute-phase reaction occurs that is associated with a dramatic increase in serum il-6 (70–72), postischemic and border zone myocardial tissue appears to be the source of this
il-6 (73,74). the transient marked reduction of plasma plp
following an mi can thus be viewed as a component of the
acute-phase response prompted by this il-6. the analysis of
vermaak and colleagues concludes that the post-mi decline
in plasma plp does indeed reflect an acute increase in plp
phosphatase activity, though it does not pinpoint the site of
this activity (69). (it should perhaps be noted that subsequent prospective studies have indeed confirmed that
plasma plp is a cardiovascular risk factor – albeit not quite
so dominant a one as suggested by the original south
african research!) (45,75–78).
recent evidence that plasma hcy correlates with
bmi and insulin resistance (79,80) may likewise be rationalized as reflecting an acute-phase impact on plp.
hypertrophied visceral adipose tissue has been shown to
release il-6 – a likely explanation for the elevation of fibrinogen and other acute-phase reactants associated with
visceral obesity (81,82). however, the hyperinsulinemia
seen in visceral obesity may increase hcy by an independent mechanism, as insulin has been shown to suppress hepatocyte expression of cbetas (83).
these considerations of course do not rule out the
possibility that other mechanisms play a role in the elevations of hcy associated with smoking, inflammation, and
aging. (for example, diminished renal function (36) as
well as hyperinsulinemia (80) may contribute to the agerelated increase in homocysteine.) moreover, it seems
likely that concurrent supplementation with such factors
as folate, vitamin b12, betaine, and possibly creatine (84)
would often amplify the reduction in hcy achievable
with supplemental pyridoxine; these agents can be
expected to increase hepatocyte levels of  xxxd3156xxx , a potent allosteric activator of cbetas (85).
coffee may also disrupt pyridoxine
metabolism
the moderate dose-dependent increase of plasma hcy
seen in coffee drinkers (86) may likewise be attributable
to disruption of pyridoxine metabolism. methylxanthines

increased homocyst(e)ine may reflect acute-phase induction of plp activity

– most notably theophylline, but also caffeine – are competitive inhibitors of  xxxg1720xxx ; the ki for theophylline has been found to be 9 µm, and that for caffeine
45 µm (87). theophylline therapy is associated with
depressed plasma levels of plp (88,89). elevation of hcy
in patients receiving theophylline – correctable with supplemental pyridoxine – has been demonstrated (90). it is
thus reasonable to suspect that heavy caffeine ingestion
impedes that efficiency of pyridoxine activation, and that
adequate supplemental intakes of this vitamin will compensate for this deficit by mass action – thereby decreasing hcy. surprisingly, there do not appear to be any
published studies reporting plasma plp levels in coffee
drinkers.
