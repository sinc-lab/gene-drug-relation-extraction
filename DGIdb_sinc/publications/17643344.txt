abstract
drug therapy for late-stage (encephalitic) human african trypanosomiasis (hat) is currently very unsatisfactory with the most commonly used
drug, melarsoprol, having a 5% overall mortality. there is evidence in a mouse model of hat that  xxxg2240xxx  (sp) receptor antagonism reduces
the neuroinflammatory reaction to cns trypanosome infection. in this study we investigated the effects of combination chemotherapy with
melarsoprol and a humanised sp receptor antagonist  xxxd203xxx  ( xxxd203xxx ) in this mouse model. the melarsoprol/ xxxd203xxx  drug combination did
not produce any clinical signs of illness in mice with cns trypanosome infection. this lack of any additional or unexpected cns toxicity in the
mouse model of cns hat provides valuable safety data for the future possible use of this drug combination in patients with late-stage hat.

human african trypanosomiasis (hat), also known as
sleeping sickness, continues to be a major threat to human
health throughout sub-saharan africa [1]. caused by protozoan
parasites of the genus trypanosoma, the disease may present as
the west african form, due to trypanosoma brucei gambiense
(t.b.gambiense), or the east african form due to t.b.
rhodesiense [1,2]. hat is invariably fatal if untreated, but the
trivalent arsenical drug melarsoprol, the most commonly
administered drug for the, encephalitic or late-stage, of the
disease, actually kills 5% of patients who receive it because of a
severe post-treatment reactive encephalopathy[1,3]. the cause
of the ptre is still unclear [1,2]. while the drug eflornithine
( xxxd1972xxx ) is now increasingly used as first line therapy for
gambiense disease, this drug is not effective for rhodesiense
patients who, for the foreseeable future, will continue to be
treated with highly toxic melarsoprol [1].

we have previously reported the use of a non-peptide
 xxxg2240xxx  (sp) receptor antagonist in reducing the neuroinflammatory response to experimental trypanosomiasis infection
in a highly reproducible mouse model which closely mimics the
neuropathological features that are seen in human patients with
cns hat [4,5]. this finding not only showed the key role of the
sp neuropeptide in generating the neuroinflammatory response in
experimental hat, but also suggested that a humanised sp

receptor antagonist might have therapeutic potential in reducing
the incidence and/or severity of the ptre in patients with latestage disease who have been treated with melarsoprol. the recent
availability of a humanised sp receptor antagonist,  xxxd203xxx ,
( xxxd203xxx ® merck & co. inc.) now allows this possibility to be
tested.  xxxd203xxx  has been shown to be a useful and effective drug
in reducing nausea and is registered for use in patients to help
prevent chemotherapy induced nausea and vomiting in cancer
treatment and post-operative induced nausea and vomiting.
however, a pre-requisite for any clinical trial in patients is a

clear demonstration that a combination of melarsoprol with this
sp receptor antagonist does not produce unexpected cns toxicity
in the mouse model of late-stage hat. we report here that no such
toxicity occurred with this combination.
female cd-1 mice were infected with 1 × 104 parasites of
trypanosoma brucei brucei, cloned stabilate gvr35/c1.8, by
intraperitoneal injection. the infection was allowed to progress
naturally until the cns-stage of the disease was attained. on
day 21 post-infection the animals were divided into 3 separate
treatment groups. the first group of animals was treated with a
curative topical melarsoprol regimen where 0.1 ml of
melarsoprol gel formulation (approximately 100 mg/kg melarsoprol) was administered between the shoulders of the mice
and gently massaged into the skin on days 21, 22 and 23 postinfection [6]. the second group of mice was treated with
1.78 mg/kg  xxxd203xxx  on day 21 post-infection and 1.14 mg/kg
 xxxd203xxx  on days 22 and 23 post-infection.  xxxd203xxx  is
largely insoluble therefore a fine suspension of the drug was
prepared in sterile water and the appropriate dose administered
by oral gavage. the remaining animals were treated, on days 21,
22 and 23 post-infection, with the topical melarsoprol and
 xxxd203xxx  protocols simultaneously. uninfected groups of mice
treated with identical drug regimens to those described were run
in parallel with the infected animals to act as controls.
parasitaemia was monitored by microscopic examination of
fresh blood smears before and after administration of the drug

inflammation are apparent in the uninfected mouse treated with the melarsoprol/ xxxd203xxx  combination (d).(original magnification × 12.5).

protocols. parasites were detected in all animals in infected
groups before chemotherapy was given. administration of
melarsoprol either alone or in combination with  xxxd203xxx 
cleared the trypanosomes from the blood, however, as expected,
administration of  xxxd203xxx  monotherapy failed to clear the
parasites from the blood and the animals remained parasitaemic.
throughout the experimental procedures the mice were
monitored for signs of clinical disease using a visual assessment
scale of 0–6 where 0 corresponds to an animal showing no signs
of clinical disease and 6 represents death or euthanasia of the
mouse [7]. this scale is described in detail in table 1. at day 35
post-infection the animals were sacrificed and the brains excised
and processed for histopathology. h&e stained sections were
examined by two independent assessors in a blinded fashion
and a score of 0–4, where 0 represents no pathological change
and 4 signifies a severe meningoencephalitis, assigned [4,7].
the characteristics determining each grade in the neuropathology scoring system are detailed in table 2.
statistical comparisons between the groups of mice were
undertaken to assess the neuropathological and clinical response
scores. the neuropathological scores for the individual mice
were based on the average of the independent assessor scores
measured as described. a wilcoxin signed rank test was
employed to confirm that uniformity existed between the
assessors' grading. clinical response scores were determined
using the average score over a series of repeat observations taken
during the course of the experiment. clinical and neuropathological responses, between different groups, were investigated
using analysis of variance (anova) followed by tukey's
multiple range test and significant differences identified using a
5% significance level.
infected animals given  xxxd203xxx  monotherapy showed a
significantly ( p b 0.0001) more severe clinical reaction [mean ±
se (2.717 ± 0.366)] than all other groups of mice where no signs
of clinical illness were detected (0.000 ± 0.000). mice treated with
melarsoprol /  xxxd203xxx  combination chemotherapy showed a
significantly ( p = 0.0147) lower neuropathological reaction
(0.625 ± 0.106) that those given  xxxd203xxx  alone (1.100 ± 0.127)
but not significantly (p = 0.0812) different to those given
melarsoprol monotherapy (0.714 ± 0.085). fig. 1 shows a coronal
brain section, stained with haematoxylin and eosin, from a
representative mouse from each infected group and that of an
uninfected animal treated with the melarsoprol and  xxxd203xxx 
combination regimen. an increase in inflammatory cell infiltration was detected in the meninges and lateral ventricle in the
infected animals given  xxxd203xxx  monotherapy resulting in the
higher overall neuropathology score attributed to this group of
mice.
all infected groups of mice showed a significantly higher
neuropathological response than uninfected animals (table 3).
these results clearly demonstrate that a combination of
melarsoprol and a humanised sp receptor antagonist,  xxxd203xxx ,
( xxxd203xxx ) does not cause any additional or unexpected cns
toxicity in the mouse model of cns hat. furthermore, the
melarsoprol/ xxxd203xxx  drug combination approach did not
produce any clinical signs of illness. the neuropathological
and clinical grading systems allowed us to evaluate these effects

the neuropathology response scores were measured in mice infected (i) with
t.b. brucei and treated with topical melarsoprol (m),  xxxd203xxx  (a) or a
combination of both topical melarsoprol and  xxxd203xxx  (m+a) starting on day
21 post-infection. uninfected (u), drug treated, control groups were assessed
in parallel with the experimental animals. the mean score and standard error
(mean ± se) together with the number of animals are detailed for each group.
the figures in the body of the table demonstrate the comparisons, in terms
of statistical significance, between the groups shown in the row and column
headings. the 95% confidence intervals for the differences between the group
means are given along with the p-values.

rigorously. infected mice which were treated with  xxxd203xxx 
alone were the only group that showed any clinical impairment
and also showed a higher neuropathology score than those
treated with either melarsoprol or the melarsoprol/ xxxd203xxx 
combination. this was to be expected since  xxxd203xxx  has no
trypanocidal properties. the control experiments also confirmed that all the infected groups had significantly higher
neuropathology scores than the uninfected animals and that the
latter group showed no detectable pathology or clinical
impairment when given  xxxd203xxx  and melarsoprol either
alone or in combination.
it is recognised that results obtained in animal models of
disease do not necessarily reflect the pathological situation in
human subjects. however, screening new drug combinations,
even when the individual drug's safety profiles are known, for
possible unexpected toxicity is essential in animals prior to
proceeding to clinical trials. the results of these current
studies provide a measure of reassurance that any unforeseen
drug interaction with this combination is very unlikely to
occur.
