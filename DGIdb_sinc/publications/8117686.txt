abstract: 17p-(n-tert- butylcarbamoy1)-4-aza-sa-androstanl-en-3-one (finasteride), which has been
approved for treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia, is shown here to be a slow time-dependent inhibitor
of human steroid sa-reductase isozyme 1. this inhibition is characterized by an initial, fast step where
the inhibitor binds to the enzyme followed by a slow step that leads to a final enzyme-inhibitor complex
(ei'). no recovery of activity from this ei' complex was observed after dialysis for 3 days. the formation
of ei' is diminished in the presence of a competitive, reversible inhibitor, indicating that the inhibition is
active site-directed. at 37 "cand ph 7.0, the rate constant for the second, slow inhibition step, k3, is (1.40
f 0.04) x
s-l and the pseudo-bimolecular rate constant, k3/ki, is (4.0 f 0.3) x lo3m-l s-l. this latter
rate constant is less than the value of 2.7 x lo5m-l s-l determined for the inhibition of sa-reductase 2 by
finasteride [faller, b., farley, d., & nick, h. (1993) biochemistry 32,5705-57101. the 1,2-double bond
within the a ring of finasteride may be the key structural element required for the slow step, since two other
4-azasteroids, 5a-23-methyl-4-aza-21-norchol-1-en-3,20-dione
and 17p-(n,n-diethylcarbamoyl)-4-azasa-androstan-l-en-3-one,
which share the same a ring structure with finasteride, are also slow inhibitors
of sa-reductase 1, whereas 17~-(n,n-diethylcarbamoy1)-4-methyl-4-aza-sa-androstan-3-one
(4-ma) and
17~-(n,n-diethylcarbamoyl)-4-aza-sa-androstan-3-one,
which lack the 1,2-double bond in the a ring of
finasteride, do not show slow inhibition kinetics. these data suggest covalent modification of sa-reductase
by finasteride.

inhibitors of steroid sa-reductase ( xxxg29xxx   xxxg30xxx   xxxg31xxx   xxxg32xxx   xxxg872xxx   xxxg1216xxx .5), which
catalyzes the nadph-dependent reduction of testosterone
to dihydrotestosterone, are of considerable interest for the
treatment of those diseases that are at least partially dependent
on dihydrotestosterone such as benign prostatic hyperplasia
(bph), acne, and male pattern baldness (wilson, 1980;
mooradian et al., 1987; cunha et al., 1987; metcalf et al.,
1987). in man, two isozymes of 5a-reductase, designated
types 1 and 2, have been reported (anderson & russell, 1990;
andersonet a\., 1991). sa-reductase 1has been foundmainly
in skin and liver but not in prostate, whereas 5a-reductase 2,
often referred to as the prostatic sa-reductase, has been found
in prostate, seminal vesicles, liver, and epididymis (thigpen
et al., 1993). since both isozymes contribute to the plasma
level of dihydrotestosterone (anderson et al., 1991), it is
necessary to design potent inhibitors of both the isozymes.
finasteride,' 17fl-(n-tert-butylcarbamoyl)-4-aza-5a-androst-l-en-3-one, is the only sa-reductase inhibitor currently
approved in the u.s. for treatment of bph. several clinical
reports have shown that a 5-mg dose of finasteride given daily
reduced dihydrotestosterone levels by about 70% (geller, 1990;
ohtawa et al., 1991; mcconnell et al., 1992). higher doses
of finasteride were unsuccessful at further lowering the plasma

level of dihydrotestosterone (imperato-mcginley et al., 1990;
ohtawa et al., 1991). initial reports showed that finasteride
was a competitive, reversible inhibitor of both isozymes of
5a-reductase, where it possessed relatively poor affinity for
5a-reductase 1 and moderate affinity for 5a-reductase 2 (liang
et al., 1985; anderson et al., 1991; jenkins et al., 1992).
however, a more recent report by faller et al. (1993)
demonstrated that finasteride was, in fact, a slow and potent
inhibitor of 5a-reductase 2. this result appears to suggest
that the failure to eliminate dihydrotestosterone from plasma
by finasteride is due to its inability to inhibit 5a-reductase 1
at the doses used.
this paper will show that finasteride is also a slow and
potent inhibitor of 5a-reductase 1 but that the rate constant
for the slow inhibition is much less than the value reported
for 5a-reductase 2.

methods
plasmid construction. the plasmid ph5a45 containing a
cdna copy of the human sa-reductase 1 gene was kindly
provided by dr. david russell. synthetic oligonucleotides
and site-directed mutagenesis (sambrook et al., 1989) were
used to create nhei restriction sites immediately 5’ and 3’ of
the coding sequence of the cdna (gctagctataaaaatatg-sa-reductase
1 coding sequence-taagtgctagc). the coding sequence was then subcloned into
the nhei site of the baculovirus transfer plasmid pjvploz
(vialard et al., 1990). in this plasmid, the sa-reductase 1
gene was placed downstream of the viral polyhedrin promoter,
and the bacterial gene coding for the enzyme @-galactosidase
was cloned downstream of the viral p10 promoter. this
plasmid was designated pjvp1oz-sal.
production of the recombinant virus. the s€9 cell line
was obtained from the american type cell culture collection.
the cells were maintained in grace’s medium (gibco),
supplemented with 3.3 pg/ml lactalbumin hydrolysate
(difco), 3.3 pg/ml yeastolate, 50 pg/ml gentamicin (gibco), and 0.1% pluronic f-68 (gibco) in 125-ml spinner
flasks. to generate recombinant baculovirus, sf9 cells (2 x
106 cells/ml) were cotransfected with 1 pg of linear viral
dna (invitrogen) and 3 pg of pjvp1oz-sal dna using a
cationic liposome transfection kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions (invitrogen). virus was harvested after
4 days and screened for the recombinants by plaque assay
(summers & smith, 1987; o’reilly et al., 1992). recombinant viruses obtained from this screen were subjected to
two further rounds of plaque purification.
production of sa-reductase 1 by sp cells. for the
production of sa-reductase 1, sf9 cells were grown in a 5-l
airlift fermenter. the fermenter was seeded with 4 x lo5/
ml sf9 cells in sf900ii (gibco). the temperature was
maintained at 28 oc, and oxygen was maintained at 50% air
saturation by sparging. cells at a density of 2 x lo6cells/ml
were infected with recombinant virus at a multiplicity of
infection of 0.1 infectious virus particle per cell. seventy-two
hours after infection, the cells were harvested by centrifugation,
rinsed once in phosphate-buffered saline, and then quick frozen
in a dry ice-ethanol bath.
preparation of microsomal sa-reductase 1. baculovirusinfected sf-9 cells expressing human sa-reductase 1 were
frozen at -80 oc until microsome preparation. all homogenization steps were performed on ice, and all centrifugations
were done at 4 “c. at the time of preparation, the cells (60
ml) were thawed, diluted 5-fold with homogenization buffer
(50 mm potassium phosphate, ph 7.4, 0.25m sucrose, 0.1
mm edta), and homogenized with a brinkmann polytron
for two, 15-s blasts at 16000 rpm. the homogenate was
further homogenized with a teflon/glass homogenizer attached to a con-torque power unit at high speed for 10 strokes.
the homogenate was centrifuged at 600gfor 10 min, and the
resulting supernatant was centrifuged at 104oog for 15 min.
the 10400g pellet was resuspended in homogenization buffer
using the teflon/glass homogenizer and then recentrifuged
at 10400gfor 15 min. all 10400gsupernatants werecombined
and centrifuged at 1015oog for 1 h. this resuspension and
centrifugation procedure was repeated once. the microsome
pellet was resuspended in 12 ml of buffer (50 mm mops,
ph7.0,0.005%tritonx-100,0.3
mmkc1)using theteflon/
glass homogenizer. the microsomes were stored in small
aliquots (<lo0 pl) at -80 o c , thawed once for use in the
enzyme assay, and then discarded.

sa-reductase 1 activity assays. reaction solution a
contained 17.6 mm imidazole, 17.6 mm diethanolamine, and
13.2 mm  xxxd3251xxx  at ph 7.0, and the total ionic strength
was adjusted to 0.30 m with kc1. a stock solution of
radioactive testosterone was prepared by removing the ethanol
from 40 pl of [1,2,6,7-3h(n)]testosteronewith a stream of
n2 gas. a 440-pl aliquot of reaction solution a containing
5% me2so was then added to the dry radioactive testosterone
to give a 1 pm 91 nci/pl solution. reaction solution b
contained 10 mm dtt, 10 mm nadph, and the nadph
regeneration system of 10 mm  xxxd1292xxx  and 12
units/ml of  xxxg825xxx  in reaction
solution a. a 5% me2so stock solution in reaction solution
a was prepared. this solution was used to maintain a final
concentration of 1.5% me2so in the assay. finally, a 5areductase 1 stock solution (0.1-1 mg/ml) was prepared in
reaction solution a containing 1 mm dtt and stored at 4 oc.
the reaction mixture (50 pl total) was prepared by adding
5 pl of reaction solution b, 5 pl of the testosterone stock
solution, and sa-reductase 1 to buffer a. the reaction was
performed in glass vials at either 22 or 37 ‘c and initiated by
addition of enzyme. the reaction was quenched with 100 pl
of ethanol, and the glass vial was vortexed vigorously. a
15-pl aliquot of the quenched solution was injected onto a
hplc column, and testosterone and dihydrotestosterone
were separated with a water/acetonitrile (52%:48%) mobile
phase. the relative amounts of testosterone and dihydrotestosterone were determined by an in-line flow radiochemical
detector (beckman 171-radiodetector). all thereactions were
first order in testosterone, and enzymatic activities were
expressed as the first-order rate constant for loss of substrate.
determination of ki’s for finasteride and 4-ma. stock
solutions of finasteride and 4-ma were prepared in me2so.
inhibition studies were identical to activity assays except that
the reactions were quenched at 1 min or less. the relative
inhibition r was fit by nonlinear least-squares analysis to

where (v/k)ois the activity in the absence of inhibitor, i, and
ki is the inhibition constant. this equation applies only when
the substrate concentration is much less than its km.
progress curve analysis. the reaction mixture was scaled
up to 400 pl. at different times, 20-pl aliquots of the reaction
mixture were removed and quenched with 40 pl of ethanol,
and product formation was monitored as above. this
procedure was performed with and without finasteride.
preincubation experiments. the sa-reductase 1 solution
was incubated for 30 min at a specified temperature in 198
p l of reaction buffer a, containing all the components except
testosterone. then, either 2 pl of mezso or 2 pl of 1 pm
4-azasteroid inhibitor in me2so was added to start the
preincubation. at different times, 5 pl of this preincubation
mixture was removed and added immediately to 45 pl of the
reaction mixture to assay for activity. the reaction was
quenched as above.
recovery ofactivity from inactivated sa-reductase 1. sareductase l was inactivated by incubating the enzyme with
1 mm nadph, 1 mm dtt, f l pm finasteride, and the
nadph regenerating system in reaction buffer a (200 pl
total) for 5 h at 22 o c .
two procedures were used to remove unbound finasteride.
in the first procedure, the enzyme solution was centrifuged
at looooog for 30 min. the microsome pellet was washed

three times and resuspended in 200 pl of fresh buffer. this
was repeated once. the final sa-reductase 1 pellet was
resuspended in 100 pl of buffer a, and the sa-reductase
activity was assayed at different time intervals. in the second
procedure, 400 plof the inhibited sa-reductase 1 was pelleted,
washed, and resuspended as in the first procedure; however,
this sample was then placed in dialysis tubing with a molecular
weight cutoff of 15 000. dialysis was performed against 400
ml of reaction buffer containing all reaction components
except the substrates and the nadph regeneration system.
the samples were dialyzed for 3 days and the dialysis buffer
was changed every 24 h. the enzyme activity was determined
after dialysis.

results and discussion
evidence that finasteride inhibits sa-reductase 1 slowly.
inhibition studies were performed at ph 7.0. to maintain
saturating levels of nadph (1 mm) and to avoid the
accumulation of nadp+, a regenerating system of 1 mm
 xxxd1292xxx  and 1.2 units/ml glucose-6-phosphate
dehydrogenase was employed. the initial concentration of
testosterone was set to 100 nm. since this value is much
lower than its k m (7 pm; harris et al., 1992), these reactions
were first order in testosterone.
for a first-order reaction, the shape of a progress curve is
indicative of the type of interaction (slow or fast binding)
between inhibitor and enzyme. if there is no time-dependent
inhibition of the enzyme, a semilogarithmic plot of the progress
curve will be linear; otherwise, time-dependent inhibition will
yield a curved semilogarithmic plot. in the absence of
finasteride, the progress curve for sa-reductase 1 was linear
at several enzyme concentrations. a typical progress curve
for the sa-reductase 1-catalyzed reaction run at 37 "cin the
presence of 1 pm finasteride is shown in figure 1a. the
curvature of this progress curve suggests slow inhibition by
finasteride.
to confirm that the inhibition was slow, preincubation
experiments were performed. here, sa-reductase 1 was
preincubated with 1 pm finasterideat 30 o c for various times,
and then the remaining activity was determined. for such
experiments to be meaningful, the enzyme activity must remain
relatively stable throughout the course of the reaction. dtt
and kc1 at 1 mm and 0.26 m, respectively, were found to
stabilize the sa-reductase 1 activity (data not shown). with
finasteride present at 1 p m (figure lb), only 10% of the
initial sa-reductase activity remained after 60 min, whereas
without finasteride, 95% of the initial activity remained at the
same time point. in both cases, the loss of enzymatic activity
was first order, where the observed rate constants in the
presence and absence of inhibitor were 7 x 10-4 s-l and 3.0
x 10-5 s-1, respectively.
reversibility of the slow inhibition of sa-reductase 1 by
finasteride. to determine if the inhibition of sa-reductase
1 by finasteride was reversible, two experiments were performed. in the first experiment, sa-reductase 1 was completely
inactivated by incubation with finasteride for 5 h. the
microsomal enzyme was then separated from the unbound
finasteride by repeated centrifugation and resuspension steps.
an aliquot of this enzyme sample was then incubated at 37
oc and monitored for recovery of activity (table 1). in the
second experiment, another aliquot of this enzyme sample
was dialyzed for 3 days in an attempt to release bound
finasteride and then incubated at 37 oc and monitored for
recovery of activity (table 1). no activity (<1% relative to

into ca. 77% reduction in the activity in 72 h. this residual activity was
seen immediately after the removal of unbound finasteride, but it did not
increase with time. sa-reductase 1 was inhibited and washed as
described above and then dialyzed at 22 o c for 3 days. enzyme inhibited

suggest either that the finasteride/5a-reductase 1 complex is
irreversible or that the half-life (koff < 10-6s-l) for this complex
is greater than 10 days.
a two-step slow inhibition by finasteride. to determine
if the inhibition of sa-reductase 1 by finasteride followed a
two step mechanism, preincubation experiments were carried
out at different concentrations of finasteride (figure 2a).
loss of activity was first order in enzyme for the first 4 halflivesofthereaction. theobserved rateconstants for inhibition,
kobsd, were calculated from the slopes of activity vs time plots
(morrison, 1982; morrison & walsh, 1988), and these k o h d
values were then replotted vs the finasteride concentration
(figure 2b). the fact that the kobsd is a hyperbolic function

the values of kobd may also be determined from progress

of finasteride concentration (figure 2b) indicates a two-step
mechanism:

in this mechanism, the equilibrium for the first step is
established rapidly whereas the second step is slow. in eq 2,
ki is the dissociation constant for the initial e1 complex and
k3 the rate constant for the slow inhibition step. for this
mechanism, the kobsd is given by (shaprio & riordan, 1984)
(3)
the values for k3 (table 2) and ki (0.96 f 0.30 mm) were
estimated from .nonlinear least-squares analysis.
the ki was alsodetermined by measuring enzyme inhibition
at very short time points ( i 1 min). from this experiment,
the ki was 0.36 f 0.04 pm (table 2). the discrepancy between
this value and the one (0.96 f 0.30 pm) from slow inhibition
experiments was ascribed to systematic errors associated with
the methods, and the source of the errors was not investigated.
this latter value (0.36 f 0.04 mm) was reproduced at both

0.03) x
s-l (37 "c) was obtained from nonlinear leastsquares analysis of the data given in figure 1a. the estimate
of k3 (table 2) was then obtained by using eq 3 with ki = 0.36
f 0.04 pm and [i] = 1 pm.
the slow inhibition is active site-directed. to evaluate
whether the slow inhibition occurs at the active site, the effect
of a competitive and reversible inhibitor of sa-reductase,
4-ma, on the rates of slow inhibition by finasteride was
examined. from preincubation studies, 4-ma was shown
not to be a time-dependent inhibitor of sa-reductase 1 (figure
3a, open circles). 4-ma protected sa-reductase 1 from slow
inhibition by finasteride; furthermore, thedegree of protection
depended on the concentration of 4-ma (figure 3a). the
expression for kobsd in the presence of a rapidly binding,
competitive inhibitor is given by (weiss & cleland, 1987;
plapp 1987)

this ki value is in good agreement with the value of 12 f 1

results strongly suggest that the slow inhibition of sa-reductase
1 by finasteride is active site-directed.
why is finasteride a slow inhibitor of sa-reductase?
there are several mechanisms that result in slow rates of
enzyme inhibition. these mechanisms include steps, such as
chemical and conformational transformations, that are slower
than the time required for carrying out the experiments
(morrison & walsh, 1988). the inability to recover 5areductase 1 activity after incubation with finasteride suggests
that the inhibition is covalent and that this covalent step is
responsible for the slow inhibition kinetics. in addition to
finasteride (1) (for the structure, see figure 4), sa-23-methyl4-aza-21-norchol- l-en-3,20-dione (2) and 17/3-(n,n-diethylcarbamoyl)-caza-5a-androstan1-en-3-one (3) are also
time-dependent inhibitors of sa-reductase 1 (figure 9,
whereas 17~-(n,n-diethylcarbamoy1)-4-aza-sa-androstan3-one (4) as well as 4-ma (5) are reversible inhibitors. it
should be noted that the 1,zbond within the a ring of 4 and
4-ma is saturated. however, all three compounds (1-3) that

show slow inhibition possess a common structural feature, a
1,2-double bond in the a ring. these results suggest that the
double bond within the a ring plays an important role in the
slow inhibition. in fact, petrov and lark (1981) proposed
(scheme 1a) that the catalytic driving force for the sareductase reaction is the polarization of the a,&unsaturated
carbonyl of testosterone (6). this mechanism may also
facilitate a chemical transformation between the enzyme and
inhibitor, with the a,b-unsaturated carbonyl within the a ring
of finasteride acting as a michael acceptor (scheme 1b).
confirmation that sa-reductase 1 is, in fact, covalently
modified by finasteride awaits further investigation.
comparison between slow inhibition by finasteride of
isozymes of sa-reductase. faller et al. (1993) have demonstrated that finasteride shows slow inhibition kinetics with
sa-reductase 2. the upper limit of the ki was estimated to
be much less than 1 nm by using the value of the association
rate constant k,, and the estimated limit of the dissociation
rate constant k,ff (faller et al., 1993). if the value for the
dissociation rate of finasteride from the inactivated 5areductase 1 is set to 10" s-l (see before), this apparent ki
would also be less than 1 nm. in conclusion, finasteride is a
potent inhibitor of both isozymes of sa-reductase.
however, the in vitro potency of finasteride does not appear
to translate into in vivo effects. as mentioned earlier, a normal
dose response of dihydrotestosterone level in plasma occurs
up to 5 mg of finasteride, but the response plateaus off at
higher doses (imperato-mcginley et al., 1990; ohtawa et al.,
1991). such a biphasic behavior is typical of situations where
the therapeutic target exists in two isozymic forms and one
of the isoforms is insufficiently inhibited. since the in vitro
potency of finasteride is now no longer an issue, the difference
between the rates of inhibition of the isozymes may account
for the in vivo observations. the slow inhibition of 5areductase 2 by finasteride is characterized by an apparent
one-step mechanism whose second-order inhibition rate
constant, kon,is 2.7 x lo5 m-ls-' at 37 oc and ph 7.0 (faller
et al., 1993), whereas, under the same conditions, the slow
inhibition of sa-reductase 1 by finasteride is typical of a twostep mechanism and the pseudo-bimolecular constant k3/ki
is estimated to be 4.0 x lo3 m-l s-l (table 2). this means
that it takes 70 times longer for finasteride to completely
inhibit sa-reductase 1 than to inhibit sa-reductase 2. im-

perato-mcginley and co-workers ( 1990) determined that, after
a 5-mg dose, finasteride in plasma reached a maximum
concentration of 100 nm. since 90%of finasteride in plasma
is bound to serum proteins (lee et al., unpublished data), the
effective maximum concentration would be about 10 nm. in
addition, the half-life of finasteride in plasma is only about
5 h as determined by pharmacokinetics (imperato-mcginley
et al., 1990). given these measurements, the 50-reductase
2 inhibition would happen within minutes, whereas 5areductase 1 would be inhibited no more than 50% after 5 h,
consistent with the observations that, at therapeutic doses,
finasteride fails to eliminate dihydrotestosterone from plasma.
