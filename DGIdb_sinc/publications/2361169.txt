potentials in mouse skeletal muscles

1 the purpose of this investigation was to determine the long-term effects of a single dose of persistent
anticholinesterases on muscle action potentials evoked by nerve stimulation.
2 action potentials (aps), elicited by stimulation of the phrenic nerve, were recorded intracellularly in
muscle fibres of mouse diaphragm. the time between stimulus and ap was measured and the variability
of this latency was calculated during trains of aps. at the beginning of trains of aps there was an increase
in latency, and this delay was also measured.
3 within 3h of subcutaneous injection, a single dose (500nmolkg-1) of the anticholinesterase,  xxxd1962xxx  produced about 90% reduction in the acetylcholinesterase activity of homogenates of mouse
diaphragm muscle, but five days after injection, this activity was not different from values in untreated
animals. the initial delay of aps and the variability of latencies were increased four fold and two fold
respectively, remained at these maxima from the 1st to the 5th day after  xxxd1962xxx , and returned to the
values in untreated animals between 15 and 27 days after  xxxd1962xxx .
4 these effects of  xxxd1962xxx  on ap latency were dose-dependent and were also seen in extensor digitorum longus and soleus muscles.
5 other anticholinesterases used were bos (pinacolyl s-(2-trimethylaminoethyl)methylphosphonothioate), a quaternary compound, and  xxxd2393xxx , a tertiary compound,
which had effects similar to those of  xxxd1962xxx ; the greater duration of the effects of this compound may
be related to the greater duration of reduction in cholinesterase activity.
6  xxxd1962xxx  had no effect on the delay or variability of latencies of endplate potentials which were
recorded in cut-fibre preparations 5 days later.
7 it is concluded that the effects of  xxxd1962xxx  on the latencies of indirectly-evoked muscle aps are
postjunctional, may not be related to the degree of reduction in cholinesterase activity at the time of
recording, and are not directly linked to necrosis.

introduction
subcutaneous injection of the organophosphate anticholinesterase,  xxxd1962xxx , causes necrosis at the endplate of mouse

diaphragm (ferry & townsend, 1986) which reaches a
maximum 6-12h after injection. however, only a minority of
the muscle fibres show necrosis and the question arises as to
whether those fibres without structutal damage are more
subtly affected. transmission of excitation from nerve to the
muscle and propagation of the action potential along the
muscle might be compromised in damaged fibres.
the clinical technique of single fibre electromyography
(sfemg) involves recording extracellularly the current field
due to action potentials in single muscle fibres and may be
used to measure jitter, the variability in the latency of a series
of action potentials (aps). this variability may be in the time
between aps of two fibres of the same motor unit in voluntary
activity (stalberg & trontelj, 1979), or in the time between
stimuli and aps in a fibre during a train of evoked responses
(trontelj et al., 1986). excessive jitter is found in patients with
muscular dystrophy or with myasthenia gravis, or after drugs
(e.g. (+ )- xxxd3456xxx ), and is a sensitive indicator of muscular
or neuromuscular disease. jitter was considered by stalberg &
trontelj (1979) to originate in the interaction of the endplate
potential (e.p.p.) and the threshold of the muscle membrane
during transmission.
in the experiments in vitro described here, a new method of
measuring jitter was developed. action potentials evoked by
nerve stimulation were recorded intracellularly which ensured
that successive responses would be recorded from the same
part of a single fibre. in order that all sources of jitter, presynaptic or postsynaptic, would be included, records were made

close to the end of the muscle fibre near the tendon, but in
some experiments records were made at the endplate. the
membrane potential and overshoot of the ap are sensitive
indicators of damage and provided criteria for excluding from
further analysis any fibres damaged by the microelectrode
during the contraction.
the effect of anticholinesterases (antiches) on jitter was
studied using several antiches to exclude the possibility that
effects were other than a consequence of inhibition of acetylcholinesterase (ache). attempts were made to assess the role
of ache inhibition in the manifestation of jitter.

methods
male albino mice aged 6-7 months were used in all experiments. at various times after subcutaneous injection of drugs,
animals were killed by decapitation. the left hemidiaphragm
and phrenic nerve were removed, pinned to sylgard in a
perspex bath and irrigated with a physiological saline of the
following composition (mm): nacl 137, nahco3 12,
nah2po4 1, kci 5, cacl2 2, mgcl2 1, glucose 25 and gassed
with 5% co2 in 02 and maintained at 37.0 + 0.50c. the
phrenic nerve was stimulated via a suction electrode with
supramaximal pulses of 0.05 ms duration. to minimize muscle
movement many pins were used to fix the preparation to the
sylgard and, if necessary, some muscle fibres were cut. for
experiments on extensor digitorum longus (edl) or soleus
(sol) muscles, mice were anaesthetized with halothane in
50% nitrous oxide in oxygen; the limb muscles and their
nerve supply were then removed and recordings were made as
with the diaphragm.
glass capillary intracellular microelectrodes filled with 3m
kci and of resistance 10-15 mc were used to record resting

membrane potentials (rmps) and action potentials (aps) of
uncut muscle fibres near the tendon. endplate potentials
(e.p.ps) and miniature endplate potentials (m.e.p.ps) were
recorded in cut fibres by an electrode inserted focally at the
endplate where the risetime of the potentials was less than
1.1msmv-'. aps were displayed on an oscilloscope and
recorded on an fm tape recorder (racal store 4) with a tape
speed of 30 inches per second (i.p.s.). these records were then
replayed at 15/16 i.p.s. and analysed by a pdp 11/03 minicomputer. the sampling rate of the analogue-to-digital converter was 20khz and with a record/replay ratio of 32, the
effective sampling rate of the system was 640 khz. trains of 30
aps were recorded from each muscle fibre and approximately
10 fibres were sampled from each muscle. the stimulation frequency was usually 30hz and if recording conditions were
stable also 10hz in the same fibre. occasionally, stimulation
was at 1 hz. data from a fibre were rejected if, during the
train, there was a decrease in the rmp of more than 5 mv or
in the ap amplitude of more than 10%.
in experiments with  xxxd1962xxx  iodide in vitro, the preparation was exposed to a 0.5 gm solution for 30-40 min, then
to physiological saline for 30 min before the recording was
commenced.
unless the results with stimulation  xxxd1891xxx  hz and 30 hz were
different, only data for 30 hz are presented.

analysis of records
computer programs were devised to measure the amplitude,
time course, and latency of each ap. the latency was the
interval between the stimulus and a point on the rising phase
 xxxd1891xxx % of peak amplitude. these data were used to calculate
the mean consecutive difference (mcd) of latencies of aps
11-30 (plateau), and the individual latencies of the first 16 aps
with respect to the first ap of the train. the formula used to
calculate the mcd was:

assium acetate. when dissolved and diluted in normal saline,
the potassium injected was negligible (approximately
6 gmol kg- 1). solutions of bos and dfp were made up
shortly before injection. all mice given anticholinesterases
were also given  xxxd247xxx  0.7pmolkg-' at the same
time. some mice were given atropine only.

statistical analysis
results are expressed as mean + 1 s.d. of values from 2 to 5
animals, with the number of muscle fibres in parentheses. the
kolmogorov-smirnov non-parametric test was used and
groups were taken to be significantly different if p < 0.05 (2tail). where experimental values returned to normal a long
time after injection, the one-tail test was used because the
direction of the difference from untreated values was predictable.

results

the electrophysiological characteristics of untreated mice
in untreated animals the rmp recorded at the tendon end of
the muscle fibres was -71 + 5 mv (42). the ap had a time to
peak (from 10% peak) of 216 + 34ts (35) and an amplitude of
81 + 8 mv (35). these values were not affected by the frequency of stimulation or by administration of any of the antiches either in vivo or in vitro. records of typical action
potentials are shown in figure 1.

the effect offrequency ofstimulation
the effect on jitter of the stimulus frequency was investigated
because there is a marked effect of frequency on the amplitude
of e.p.ps, which then may affect the latencies of the aps elicited. in untreated preparations, with stimulation  xxxd1891xxx  or

mcd={ili, -l121+1l12-ll131+ +l29-l301}/19
where ln is the latency of ap number n.
the use of the mcd as a measure of variability may reduce
the effects of any long-term drifts in latency, but this technique
might hide initial changes at the beginning of trains of aps
(ekstedt et al., 1974). in our experiments, the initial change is
measured as the 'delay' of the sixteenth ap relative to the first
ap (i.e. latency of ap 16 minus the latency ap 1).
a pulse generator (digitimer) was used to simulate action
potentials at 10hz, the value obtained for mcd was 2.4 ys,
which represents the intrinsic error of the process of record/
replay/analysis.

measurement of ache activity
the activity of ache was assayed in strips of the junctional
region of hemidiaphragms. each hemidiaphragm was cut
about 2mm either side of the intramuscular nerve and the
junctional strip of muscle weighted and homogenised in 5ml
of phosphate buffer (0.1 m, ph 8.0). the homogenate was incubated for at least 30min with 5omm  xxxd2055xxx , a selective
inhibitor of  xxxg248xxx  (bayliss & todrick, 1953),
sonicated and then centrifuged at 1500g for 15min at 4°c.
the supernatant was assayed for cholinesterase activity by the
method of ellman et al. (1961). cholinesterase activity was
expressed as nmol acetylthiocholine hydrolysed per min per
mg of wet muscle and is due mainly to the ache activity of
the endplate (das, 1989).
the anticholinesterases used were:-  xxxd1962xxx  (s-(2-trimethylammoniumethyl)phosphorothioate iodide), pinacolyl

s-(2-trimethylaminoethyl)methylphosphonothioate (bos), or
 xxxd2393xxx  (dfp).
 xxxd1962xxx  was made up from  xxxd1962xxx  eyedrops
(ayerst). this comprised 12.5mg  xxxd1962xxx  and 40mg pot-

anticholinesterases and jitter of muscle impulses

30 hz the latency of successive aps increased progressively
and reached a steady value by about the tenth ap. this
increase is quantified as the delay of ap 16 relative to ap 1.
the value of the delay  xxxd1891xxx  hz was 34 + 12 ps (10), which was
not different from that at 30hz, 32 + 22 ps (42). with stimulation at 1 hz, the delay was 1 + 25 us (11), which was different from the value at 30 hz.
the mcd of the aps 11-30 at 10hz was 9.7 + 4.6ps (44),
and at 30 hz, 9.9 + 3.6 .s (42). these values were not different
from each other but were different from that at 1 hz,
6.3 + 1.2 jus (10).
in these untreated mice, the values of mcd and of delay
were distributed unimodally (figure 2a).
it is concluded that in normal diaphragms there was progressive delay of aps at the beginning of a train elicited  xxxd1891xxx 
or 30 hz, but not at 1 hz. there was a non-progressive variation in latency of aps 11-30, the mcd, which was greater at
the higher frequencies than at 1 hz.

 xxxd1962xxx  was given subcutaneously to a batch of mice and
measurements of mcd and delay made at increasing intervals
until the values were no longer different from those of
untreated animals. three hours after a dose of 0.5gmolkg-1
 xxxd1962xxx  and atropine, which causes necrosis of some
muscle fibres, the ache activity of homogenates of the junctional region was approximately 10% of that of untreated
animals (table 1). one day after  xxxd1962xxx  0.5pmolkg-'
the delay and mcd at 30hz were increased to maximal
values which persisted until day 5 (table 2). at day 7 the delay
and mcd showed smaller increase. although the delay had
returned to normal by 15 days, the mcd was increased, but
had returned to normal by 27 days. in mice given only atropine the mcd and delay were never significantly different
from normal.
at 5 days after  xxxd1962xxx  0.5pmolkg-' the populations
of mcd and delay were not unimodal; many values were
greater than those in untreated preparations (figures 2b and
3b), and a few fibres had very large values for mcd and
delay. these fibres excepted, there was no correlation between
mcd and delay because muscle fibres with large mcds did
not necessarily have large delays. about 5% of the fibres
sampled were not analysed because the train lacked at least
one ap. there was repetitive firing of aps in about 20% of
fibres 5 days after  xxxd1962xxx  0.5 iumol kg- '.

different from that after bos but greater than after  xxxd1962xxx . as with  xxxd1962xxx , after bos and dfp the
increase in mcd and delay outlasted the inhibition of ache.
after bos the ache was normal at 15 days, when the delay
and mcd were still increased. the delay had returned to
normal by day 35, and the mcd by day 60 (table 2). after
dfp, the ache was normal by day 14 and the mcd and the
delay, by day 27 (table 3).

than that of untreated preparations, whilst the mcd of
11.8 + 5.4 ps (25) was not different. thus, the acute effects of
inhibition of ache after  xxxd1962xxx  in vitro are exerted to a
greater extent on delay than on mcd and are much more
frequency-dependent than the effects of  xxxd1962xxx  5 days
after administration in vivo.
it is concluded that antiches in necrotizing doses increased
mcd and delay of trains of aps at 30hz to a maximum
value for 5 days, which thereafter recovered. the period when
jitter was increased exceeded the period of recovery of ache.

490 nm and with wavelengths > 525 nm filtered from the
emitted beam. resting membrane potentials and sometimes
m.e.p.ps were recorded in undamaged fibres, but convincing
rmps were not recorded from autofluorescing parts of fibres
or from endplates which had a granular appearance. it is concluded that such damaged fibres are electrically silent and
hence inexcitable and would not have been included in the
population showing excessive jitter.

the effect of non-necrotizing doses of antiches
experiments were done with lower doses of antiches. after
 xxxd1962xxx  0.3 ymol kg-1 the necrosis was less than after  xxxd1962xxx  0.5 pmol kg - but greater than in untreated animals;
thus for  xxxd1962xxx , 0.3pmolkg-1 is close to the threshold
dose for necrosis, for o.lmolkg-1 did not cause necrosis
(das, 1989). the effects of  xxxd1962xxx  0.1 and 0.3pmolkg-1
on the delay, mcd and ache, and the effects of the nonnecrotizing doser of bos (1 pmol kg- 1) and dfp
(11 mol kg ') are shown in tables 1 and 3b and figures 2c,d.
compared with untreated mice, 5 days after  xxxd1962xxx 
0.3 pmolkg-1, only the delay was increased and to a lesser
extent than after  xxxd1962xxx  0.5 umol kg-1 or bos
8 pmol kg -1. after  xxxd1962xxx  0.1 ymol kg- ', the delay and
mcd were not increased. five days after bos 1 pmol kg-1
the mcd was increased to a lesser extent than after bos
8pmolkg-1, and the effect lasted up to 15 days. after dfp
11 umol kg-1 there was increased delay.
it is concluded that increases in delay and mcd are not
necessarily associated with necrosis, and that the extent and
the duration of these increases are dose- and drug-dependent.

digitorum longus (edl) and, soleus (sol) muscles were measured 5 days after  xxxd1962xxx  0.4 jmol kg -1, which causes
necrosis of the diaphragm similar to  xxxd1962xxx 
0.5 pmol kg-'. untreated edl and sol had values for delay
and mcd at 30hz similar to diaphragm (table 4), and after
 xxxd1962xxx  0.4 pmol kg-' there was an increased mcd,
similar in all three muscles, and an increased delay which was
greater in sol than in the others. after  xxxd1962xxx 
0.1 pmolkg-1, there was increased delay and mcd in sol
but not in edl or in diaphragm (tables 3 and 4). thus sol
was more sensitive to eco than the other muscles.

latencies ofe.p.ps in untreated and  xxxd1962xxx -treated
diaphragms
to investigate if the increased variability in latencies of aps
was attributable to increased variability of synaptic events,
experiments were done on muscle fibres cut to prevent aps.
the electrode was inserted to record m.e.p.ps focally, and the
latencies of e.p.ps evoked at 30 hz were measured. the results
were that the delay and mcd of the e.p.ps were not different
from those of aps recorded at the tendon end of untreated
muscle.
it is concluded that in untreated mice the variability of
latencies within the train of e.p.ps is sufficient to account for
the variability of latencies of a train of aps recorded near the
tendon, and conduction along the muscle fibre causes no
further increase in variability.
the mcd and delay of e.p.ps 5 days after  xxxd1962xxx 
0.5 umol kg-1 were the same as in untreated preparations
(table 5). it is concluded that the increased delay and mcd
after  xxxd1962xxx  cannot be due to increased variation in the
timing of release or action of the transmitter.

discussion
in these experiments, changes in the latency of aps in a train
of 30 stimuli were measured by the delay which represents a
systematic increase during the change from rest to a steady
state of activity, and by the mcd representing a nonsystematic variability of latency at this steady state. that the
delay and mcd of aps in untreated muscle is frequencydependent and attributable to the delay and mcd of e.p.ps
indicates that this jitter, like the variable quantum content of
the e.p.p. may be a normal aspect of neuromuscular transmission (ferry & kelly, 1988).
after  xxxd1962xxx  the mcd and delay of aps at the tendon
is increased without increase in the delay and mcd of the
e.p.p. thus the increased jitter is not due to exacerbation of
those factors responsible for normal jitter, but to the induction of another factor which appears to be postsynaptic. the
mechanism and site of this factor is currently under investigation.
this additional source of jitter after antiches results in the
distribution of delay and mcd becoming multimodal. after
 xxxd1962xxx  or bos the distributions contained values indicating that some fibres had apparently normal jitter, some
fibres had been moderately affected and some severely
affected. in addition to these fibres all of which had carried the
train of 30 aps and so had been subject to analysis, there was
a fourth population of fibres which was excitable but failed
during the train and, thereby, was excluded from the analysis,
and a fifth population of fibres which was necrotic and electrically silent. thus the measurement of jitter underestimates the
total damage to muscle.
regeneration of necrotized fibres begins 2 days after  xxxd1962xxx  and at 3 days some myoblasts contain regenerated
myofibrils (townsend, 1988). regenerating necrotized fibres
become functionally innervated after 7 days (grubb & harris,
1986), and it may be that the few fibres with very large values
of mcd and delay could be regenerating.

s.s. kelly et al.

the extent to which the increased jitter is secondary to the
necrosis produced by the antiches is questionable. clearly
necrotic cells do not contribute to jitter, for they are electrically silent; and 5 days after non-necrotizing doses of antiche
there is still increased delay and mcd. thus necrosis is not
essential for the appearance of increased jitter. so it may be
that the increased jitter in the diaphragm 5 days after a necrotizing dose was in those fibres surviving.
although there is increased delay and mcd after antiches
it is likely that these phenomena are not directly related.
there is no correlation between the two parameters in the
same muscle fibres, untreated or after  xxxd1962xxx , except in a
few severely affected fibres.  xxxd1962xxx  in vitro, has a greater
effect on delay than on mcd. delay recovers before mcd
after  xxxd1962xxx  in vivo. furthermore, low doses of bos
increased mcd but not delay, whereas low doses of  xxxd1962xxx  increased delay more than mcd. thus it seem that
the increased mcd and delay have different causes.
whether or not the inhibition of ache at the time of the
experiment determines the degree of jitter depends on the
interpretation of the biochemical assay of ache activity of
muscle homogenates. it has been found that the jitter after
acute exposure to  xxxd1962xxx  in vitro, when inhibition of
muscle ache was maximal, is not different from those peak
values of mcd and delay 5 days after injection in vivo when
ache was not significantly different from values in untreated

diaphragm. this indicates that, although increased jitter is a
consequence of ache inhibition, it does not depend upon the
degree of inhibition determined at the same time as the jitter.
however, the ache activity of muscle homogenates measured
several days after administration of an antiche may not represent only the activity of the functional ache responsible for
terminating transmitter action. in our experiments made 5
days after the administration of  xxxd1962xxx , about 20% of
fibres exhibited repetitive firing after a single stimulus which
indicates prolongation of transmitter action, due to inhibition
of the functional ache (ferry, 1988). thus at this time, the
biochemical determination of ache activity is not a measure
only of the functional ache responsible for terminating transmitter action; perhaps some other non-functional ache is
also measured.
whilst it is clear that the increased jitter is a consequence of
the inhibition of ache, the relation between these two
remains unclear. the differences in jitter 5 days after  xxxd1962xxx  0.5 and 0.3 imol kg- 1, bos 8 pmol kg-' and dfp
14pmolkg-1, all of which cause similar inhibition of ache
3h after administration, indicate that the maximal extent of
inhibition is not sufficient to account for the increase in jitter.
perhaps the rate of onset of inhibition and its persistence may
be factors in the aetiglogy of increased jitter. the relation
between ache activity and jitter thus remains to be determined.
