abstract
the synthetic progestins used so far for contraception and menopausal hormone therapy are derived either from testosterone
(19-nortestosterone derivatives) or from progesterone (17-oh progesterone derivatives and 19-norprogesterone derivatives).
among the 19-nortestosterone derivatives, the estrane group include  xxxd2751xxx  (net) and its metabolites, and the gonane
group include levonorgestrel (lng) and its derivatives. the later, including  xxxd1849xxx  (dsg) and its derivative  xxxd2067xxx ,
gestodene (ges) and  xxxd2753xxx  ( xxxd2749xxx ), have been referred to as third-generation progestins. several new progestins
have been synthesized in the last decade and may be considered as a fourth-generation of progestins. dienogest is referred to as a
hybrid progestin being derived from the estrane group with a 17␣-cyanomethyl group, and  xxxd1946xxx  derives from  xxxd3238xxx .
these two progestins have no androgenic effect but a partial antiandrogenic effect. the later exerts anti-mineralocorticoid effects.
this property leads to a decreased salt and water retention and a lowering in blood pressure in users of pills containing this
progestin. the 19-norprogesterone derivatives appear more specifically progestational and do not possess any androgenic,
estrogenic or glucocorticoid activity. they are referred to as “pure” progestational molecules as they bind almost exclusively
to the  xxxg1737xxx  (pr) and do not interfere with the other steroid receptor. this category includes, trimegestone,
nomegestrol acetate and nestorone® is not active orally but proved to be a potent anti-ovulatory agent when given in implants,
vaginal rings or percutaneous gel. non-androgenic progestins would appear neutral on metabolic factors and on the vessels
and would have the advantage of avoiding acnea. progestins with antiandrogenic properties may also be used for the treatment
of women with preexisting androgen related conditions. the progestins available for therapy exhibit profound differences
according to their structure or metabolites and it is inappropriate to consider the various effects of the old and new molecules as
class-effects.

1. introduction
progesterone (p) and synthetic progestins interact
not only with the  xxxg1737xxx  (pr), but
also with other steroid receptors. depending on the
derivative molecule (either p or testosterone, t) some

progestins bind to androgen receptors (ar) as well,
inducing either androgenic or anti-androgenic effects.
molecules similar to the native hormone p may exert a competitive inhibition to the mineralocorticoid
receptor and some derivatives of 17-hydroxy progesterone or testosterone may exert glucocorticoid-like
effects.
when considering the comparative potency of
progestins, it is necessary to note their specific actions: i.e. whether (1) the progestin has progestational

activity with the ability to maintain pregnancy and
transform the endometrium into the secretory phase;
(2) the progestin is anti-estrogenic with the ability to
down regulate the estrogen receptors and to decrease
the thickness of the estrogen-primed endometrium;
or (3) the progestin has anti-androgenic activity,
i.e., it opposes androgen-induced prostate growth, as
observed in animal experiments or counteracts the
effects of endogenous androgen in humans.
the effects of progestins relate to their interactions with receptors: ar (e.g., acnea, lipid effects);
glucocorticoid receptors (gr) (e.g., salt and water retention, bloating); or mineralocorticoid receptors (e.g., decreased water retention and weight).
anti-androgenic progestins may act in several ways.
they can exert competitive inhibition of the ar,
or bind to the enzyme 5-alpha reductase and hence
interact with the conversion of testosterone into dihydrotestosterone (its active metabolite). when combined with estrogen the non-androgenic progestins
do not oppose the estrogen-dependent increase in
shbg. the later effect results in more binding of
the circulating androgens and less free t available
for action at the receptor level. thus, anti-androgenic
progestins may have beneficial effects (e.g., controlling endogenous androgen and decreasing acnea or
hirsutism).
the synthetic progestins used in clinical practice
are derived either from t (19-nortestosterone derivatives) or from p (17-oh progesterone derivatives and
19-norprogesterone derivatives) [1].
among the 19-nortestosterone derivatives is the
first generation progestin, norethynodrel (the first
progestin synthesized) [1]. the second generation
is categorized into two groups: the estrane group
includes  xxxd2751xxx  (net) and its metabolites,
and the gonane group includes levonorgestrel (lng)
and its derivatives. norethynodrel, lynestrenol and
ethynodiol acetate are prodrugs of net and convert into net for exerting their action. the third
generation of progestins, derived from the latter
group are:  xxxd1849xxx  (dsg) with its active metabolite  xxxd2067xxx  also named  xxxd2067xxx ,
gestodene (ges) and  xxxd2753xxx  (and its active
17-deacetylated metabolite,  xxxd2749xxx ). these
testosterone-derived molecules have been used in
most of the contraceptives available to date and some
have androgenic activity.

2. specific activities of new progestins
several new progestins have been synthesized in
the last decade [2]. dienogest, referred to as a hybrid
progestin, is derived from the estrane group with a
17␣-cyanomethyl radical [3]. however it is considered
to be close to the pregnane group as it does not exert
the androgenic effects of the testosterone derivastives.
in contrast it has a significant anti-androgenic activity.  xxxd1946xxx  is derived from  xxxd3238xxx  [4]. the
19-nor derivatives of progesterone are referred to as
‘pure’ progestational molecules as they bind more selectively to the  xxxg1737xxx  (pr) and interfere very little with other steroid receptors [2]. this
category includes, promegestone (r5020), demegestone, trimegestone, nomegestrol acetate (nomac),
and nestorone® , as well as a new compound related
to nestorone with a methyl radical in c18 [2,5–7]
(table 1).
very small structural changes may account for considerable difference in the effects of progestins. the
addition of a double bond in the c6–7 position of
the  xxxd2303xxx  skeleton, as well as a deletion of the ch3 radical in position c19, confers to the
molecule of nomac a higher progestational potency
than  xxxd2554xxx  (mpa), both being 17-oh progesterone derivatives [6]. by contrast,
nestorone, another 19-norprogesterone with no ch3
table 1
classifications of progestins

synthetic progestins are classified according to the steroid from
which they derive, either from testosterone (estranes and gonanes)
or from progesterone (pregnanes and norpregnanes).

radical in position 6, is far more potent than nomac
but is not active orally; nestorone must be administered parenterally due to its rapid hepatic metabolism
[7] (fig. 1).
2.1. comparative progestational activity of various
gestagens
progestational activity is usually tested using the
mcphail index in immature rabbits and pregnancy
maintenance assessment in female rats. according to
these in vivo bioassays, nestorone appears to be one
of the most potent progestins. nestorone is 3–10 times
more potent than lng and 100 times more potent
than p itself when the molecules are administered subcutaneously [7]. when given orally, net, mpa and
 xxxd1946xxx  are more potent than p but less than lng
[1,4]; nomac is four times more active than mpa [6].

279

trimegestone, which has been recently synthesized,
appears more potent than nestorone [8].
the ovulation inhibition tests in rats have been used
to measure the biological anti-ovulatory potency of
these steroids. in this model, nestorone is three times
more potent than lng when administered parenterally
[7].
the binding affinity of the various progestins to the
sex steroid receptors, such as the  xxxg730xxx 
(er) or the ar, indicate considerable difference between the molecules (table 2). however, the binding
affinity does not always correlate with the in vivo tests
of estrogenic or androgenic potency.
2.2. androgenic activity of progestins
in a study using the rat ventral prostate as a source
of ar, the relative binding affinity (rba) of lng and
 xxxd1849xxx  was 70 and 40% that of t, respectively.
in contrast nestorone and p did not show significant
binding [7].
the in vivo biological assay of androgenicity usually considers the effect of a given compound on the
weight increase of the ventral prostate and other male
sex organs in immature male rats. using these models, lng and  xxxd2067xxx  express androgenicity and increase the weight of the ventral prostate in a
dose-dependent manner, while nestorone and p do not
induce such effects [7]. in similar experiments, bullock and bardin [9] demonstrated that mpa was androgenic at high doses, while duc et al. [10] showed
no androgenic effect of nomac, even when administered at very high doses.

2.3. estrogenic activity of progestins
examination of the estrogenic activity of progestins
revealed that the uterine weight of ovariectomized immature female rats was significantly increased by lng
but not by nestorone at similar doses [7]. neither compound demonstrated binding to the  xxxg730xxx .
2.4. summary of the various activities of t and p
derivatives
considering activities other than progestational action, the 19-nor-testosterone derivatives exert some androgenic activity, while only a few of these progestins
have an estrogenic effect. the 17-hydroxy progesterone derivatives, however, exhibit varying activities:
 xxxd1786xxx  (cpa) is a potent anti-androgenic
compound. mpa has slight androgenic action [9]
and exerts glucocorticoid activity when given at high
doses [11].  xxxd2557xxx  has 50% less glucocorticoid effects than mpa.  xxxd1946xxx  derived from
 xxxd3238xxx , more recently synthesized in this class
of compounds is essentially an anti-mineralocorticoid
progestin and exerts some anti-androgenic action [4].
the 19-norprogesterone derivatives appear more
specifically progestational and do not possess any
androgenic, estrogenic or glucocorticoid activity at
therapeutic doses [7,10]. nestorone binds to the gr
but does not exert glucocorticoid activity in the in vivo
assays showing no increase in liver glycogen and tyrosine transaminase tat which increase significantly
under dexamethasone [7]. however, in the ovariectomized female rats, nestorone, only at a high dose
showed significant effects on thymus regression [7].
most of the progestins available to the prescriber
exert the expected activity, namely the progestational
effect, and all progestins are able to oppose the proliferative effect of estrogens on the endometrium. however, their progestational potency varies, and the dose
required to achieve the effect on the endometrium
differs from a few micrograms to several milligrams.
the relevance of such difference resides in the ability
to use the more ‘potent’ molecules at very low doses
in long-acting delivery systems, including gels or
patches. according to their structure and the steroid
from which they derive, different molecules will exert
additional activities, some considered beneficial and
others deleterious leading to side effects. given these

differences, it appears inappropriate to claim the side
effects of ‘progestins’ to be a class-effect.

3. pharmacokinetic differences between
gestagens
other important considerations in evaluating progestagen action are pharmacokinetic properties and
binding of progestins to serum proteins. a comparison of radioactivity recovered in urine and feces after
oral and iv administration of a labelled compound
indicates the absolute bioavailability of that compound and determines its absorption via the oral route.
the compounds with the highest oral bioavailability
are gestodene,  xxxd1849xxx  and  xxxd1786xxx 
(cpa) [12,13]. the new progestins dienogest and
 xxxd1946xxx  exhibit also a high oral bioavailability
[3,14,15].
the half-life of a compound is modulated by its
binding to plasma proteins. compared with t as a reference, lng and  xxxd2067xxx  exhibit a significant but lower affinity to the sex hormone binding
globulin (shbg) [7]. while both net and lng bind
to shbg, their elimination half-lives vary: the terminal half-life (betat1/2 ) is approximately 7–8 h for net
and up to 26 h for lng. in contrast, cpa has a betat1/2
of 48 h [2] and nomac of about 50 h [16]. dienogest,
a newly synthesized hybrid progestin, has a shorter
half-life of 6–12 h. the longer half-life of the progesterone derivatives may be related to their retention and
storage in the fatty tissue [12].
progesterone,  xxxd1946xxx , dienogest and nestorone do not bind to shbg, and the free fraction of
each should be greater than most of the 19-nortestosterone-derived progestins. the oral bioavailability of nestorone is only about 10% with a shorter
half-life than progestins that bind to shbg. however,
a much slower elimination rate is observed with the
sustained-release subdermal implant [17].

4. new progestins used in contraception
and hrt
 xxxd1946xxx , which has pharmacodynamic properties very similar to progesterone [14,15], has been
developed as an oral contraceptive in pills containing

r. sitruk-ware / maturitas 47 (2004) 277–283

3 mg of the progestin and 30 ␮g of  xxxd2054xxx  (ee) (yasmin® ) [4,18] and also for hrt in a
combination containing oral estradiol ( xxxd1946xxx ® ).
 xxxd1946xxx  has anti-mineralocorticoid and progestogenic properties not found in most synthetic
progestins. the main feature of this combination resides in the ability of the progestin to counteract the
effect of ee, a potent estrogen, on liver synthesis
of  xxxg99xxx  leading to aldosterone increase.
due to its anti-mineralocorticoid properties, the
progestin antagonizes the aldosterone effect. water
and salt retention is therefore counteracted by the
anti-mineralocorticoid activity of the progestin, and
weight loss, rather than weight gain, has been observed [4,15,18]. in a 6-month study [4,15] of 3 mg
 xxxd1946xxx  plus ee (20, 15 or 30 ␮g) or 150 ␮g
lng plus 30 ␮g ee, the ee/lng group exhibited 0.7 kg increase in body weight while all three
 xxxd1946xxx  groups showed reduction of 0.7–1.7 kg.
as expected, the largest reduction appeared in those
receiving 15 ␮g ee due to  xxxd1946xxx ’s antagonism
of ee’s sodium-retaining effect. likewise, slight increases in blood pressure were seen in the lng/ee
group and decreases in the  xxxd1946xxx  groups, a
non-significant difference attributed to reduction in
extracellular volume.
large multicenter trials [19,20] evaluating  xxxd1946xxx /ee, showed good ovulation inhibition, cycle
control, tolerability and safety profile. results of the
two studies [19,20] comparing ee/ xxxd1946xxx  (yasmin® )
to ee/ xxxd1849xxx  (marvelon® ) exhibited significant
weight reduction in both groups. the difference in
weight reduction between the two treatments was also
statistically significant in both studies p < 0.0072 (13
cycle study) and p = 0.0009 (26 cycle study), with
greater reduction in the  xxxd1946xxx  group. huber et
al found that the  xxxd1946xxx  regimen decreased acne
and seborrhea from 21.5% at baseline to 7.8% at cycle
13 due to the progestin’s anti-androgenic activity.
dienogest (dng) is an anti-androgenic progestin
with strong progestational activity and when combined
with  xxxd2054xxx  (ee) (30 ␮g/day ee/2 mg/day
dienogest) is an effective oral contraceptive (pearl index ∼0.2). this coc has good bleeding control and
improves androgenic symptoms [21,22].
all the progestins may indeed block ovulation whatever their anti-ovulatory potency. however the more
potent molecules may be used at much lower doses

281

and, hence, in long-acting delivery systems such as
vaginal rings, implants, gels or transdermal patches.

5. progestins and cardiovascular disease
many of the progestins used in contraception, as
well as hrt, are derived from t, and their main side
effects are related to androgenic properties or to their
glucocorticoid effects. improvement of ocs has been
attempted by decreasing the androgenic potency of
the steroids. however, the third generation progestins,
having fewer androgenic effects than the second generation, have lost some of the ability to oppose the
effects of the  xxxd2054xxx  component of the ocs.
whether this property has resulted in lower arterial
risk but a higher risk in venous thromboembolism is
still debated.
studies have also shown that estrogen has beneficial effects on blood vessel walls; estrogen and
progesterone binding sites have been found in blood
vessel walls and in endothelial cells lining the walls.
estrogen increases the release of  xxxd2738xxx  causing
relaxation of smooth muscle cells and vasodilation.
in monkeys, neither  xxxd3023xxx  nor nomac inhibits estrogen’s beneficial effect on coronary
dilator response. however, when mpa was combined
with estrogen the positive response was inhibited by
50% [23,24].
another study in monkeys, showed that estrogen
given either alone or with  xxxd3023xxx  had
anti-atherogenic effects irrespective of hdl total
cholesterol levels. the addition of  xxxd3023xxx  did not diminish this effect [25].
5.1. venous thromboembolism (vte)
the risk of vte observed in users of ocs, particularly during the first year of use, has generated
controversy. some studies have noted increased vte
risk in users of third generation ocs. in a recent
meta-analysis, the odds ratio for the risk of vte
was 1.7 (c.i. 1.4–2.0) when third and second generation oc use was compared. the odds ratio was 3.1
(c.i. 2.0–4.6) in first-time oc users, 2.5 (1.6–4.1) in
short-term users, and 2.0 (1.4–2.7) in long-term users
[26]. other studies that had been carefully adjusted
for duration of use (or studies of first-time oc users

282

r. sitruk-ware / maturitas 47 (2004) 277–283

only) showed no statistically significant difference in
vte risk in users of ocs containing different types
of progestins [27].
odlind et al. [28] have shed some light on the role
of third generation progestins and vte risk with coc
use. although it is the estrogen dose that is associated
with vte risk, in combined oral contraceptives, the
degree of estrogenicity and thus vte risk also depends
on the androgenic and anti-estrogenic effects of the
progestin.
odlind and coworkers have studied sex hormone
binding globulin (shbg) as a marker for estrogenicity and as a surrogate marker for vte risk.
shbg, highly sensitive to estrogen, has shown dramatic dose-dependent increases with oral intake of
 xxxd2054xxx  [28,29] alone. with combined contraceptives, shbg increases to varying degrees depending on the anti-estrogenic activity of the progestin
used. odlind and coworkers found a relationship
between the reported risk of vte in various coc
studies and reported average increase in shbg levels, which the authors identify as a measure of total
estrogenicity. monophasic levonorgestrel-containing
cocs (+30 ␮g ee) have an approximate 50% shbg
increase while  xxxd1849xxx  or gestodene-containing
cocs (+30 ␮g ee) have a 200–300% rise in shbg.
in triphasic preparations containing lng, e.g., gestodene or  xxxd1849xxx , the increase in shbg is 100,
150 and 200%, respectively.  xxxd1786xxx 
with a higher vte risk than gestodene or  xxxd1849xxx 
has  xxxd3426xxx –400% shbg increase. percent increase
in levels of shbg for cocs (+30–35 ␮g ee) having no epidemiologic data for vte risk are as follows:  xxxd2753xxx , 150% increase;  xxxd1946xxx  or
dienogest, 250–300%. the combined contraceptive
vaginal ring (nuvaring, organon, inc.) releasing
15/20 ␮g/day ee/ xxxd2067xxx  results in a 150% increase in shbg and the new contraceptive patch,
releasing 20/150 ␮g/day ee/ xxxd2749xxx , a 260%
increase. whether such surrogate marker is used to
predict the risk is far from being accepted. however
as none of the clotting factors seem to be valid as
a predictor of vte risk, only long-term surveillance
and observational studies will give use some answer
about the new oc combinations.
as far as hormonal therapy used after the
menopause is concerned, the progestins are associated
with estrogen much less potent that  xxxd2054xxx ,

and derivatives of progesterone are preferred to the
androgenic progestins used in coc. however, mpa is
the most prescribed progestin in the usa in contrast
with european countries. the women’s health initiative (whi) study evaluating the effects of conjugated
equine estrogen plus mpa as a progestin in healthy
postmenopausal women was prematurely halted due
to an increased risk of breast cancer and a lack of overall benefit [30]. surprisingly the expected decrease
in cardiovascular disease was not observed and the
reverse was found with a hazard ratio of 1.29 for coronary heart disease. the study tested a specific combination of  xxxd2044xxx  and mpa given
continuously. although it has been claimed that hrt
increased the chd risk, it would be inappropriate to
extend the finding to all hrt preparations as the doses
and type of molecules is of importance in term of their
pharmacological action. while other progestins might
exert a better action than mpa on the chd, this is not
documented by large rct. also whether the findings
are due to the type or dose of molecules used, or to
the age of the population studied is actively debated.
in conclusion, the progestins available for oral contraception and for hrt are not similar and may have
profound differences according to their structure,
metabolites and pharmacodynamic actions. therefore
it is inappropriate to consider the various effects of
the old and new molecules as class-effects.
