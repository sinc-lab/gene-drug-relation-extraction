summary

we have reported recently the extensive purification of  xxxg934xxx  of escherichia coli by isoelectric focusing, gel filtration
in sephadex, and acrylamide gel electrophoresis into two forms
designated ia and ib with apparent isoelectric points of about
4.55 and 4.60 and molecular
weights of 82,000 and 88,000,
respectively (i). the two forms catalyzed the transamination
of
n-phenylalanine,
l-tryptophan,
and, marginally,
l-tyrosine,
 xxxd2595xxx 
with either ol-ketoglutarate
or oxalacetate as cosubstrates. form ia was not affected, but form ib was repressed
by growth of the organisms in the presence of tyrosine. an
aspartate:a-ketoglutarate
aminotransferase
activity coincided
with form ia in electrofocusing columns; however, we were not
prepared to claim that this activity resided in the same protein

with the aromatic activities, especially in view of conflicting
reports claiming the nonidentity
(2) and identity
(3) of the
aspartate and aromatic amino acid components. in the present
study, forms ia and is were recognized to represent different
enzymes rather than forms of one enzyme and are abbreviated for
convenience to enzyme a and enzyme b, respectively.

materials-frozen
escherichia

(atcc

were obtained
from general

the organisms
had been
grown at ph 6.5 to late log phase in a minimal

with sodium

as the carbon
source.

enzyme
puri’cation-the
purification
procedure
was as described
previously
(1) and involved
the following
steps:
ammonium
sulfate fractionation,
heat treatment
at 55”, adsorption
on
calcium
phosphate
gel, deae-cellulose
column
chromatography,
and isoelectric
focusing.
the last step also effected
the separation
of the two enzymes.
in the present
study isoelectric
focusing
was
nerformed
in both the small (110 ml) and the large (440 ml) colnmns and the gradient
was stabilizedwith
sucrose.-the
narrow
ph
range used to achieve
the highest
possible
resolution
was obtained
by an initial
focusing
of carrier
ampholytes,
ph 4 to 6, and subsequent collection
of the fractions
approximately
in the ph range of
4.3 to 4.8. in the final focusing
with the enzyme
preparation
from
the previous
purification
step, the concentration
of carrier
ampholytes was about
1%. other
details
are given
in the appropriate
legend. throughout
purification
enzyme
activity
was monitored
as
tyrosine:
2.oxoglutarate
aminotransferase
( xxxg2250xxx ).
in one
electrofocusing
experiment
the fractions
were
assayed
also for
aminotransferase
activity
toward
the n-aromatic
amino acids and
l-aspartic
acid.
the
carrier
ampholytes
were
removed
from
selected
pooled
fractions
in an amicon
ultrafiltration
unit (membrane filter pm-lo)
by passage of 2 to 3 liters
of 0.05 m potassium
phosphate
buffer,
ph 7.0, containing
1 mm edta,
1 mm dithiothreitol,
2 mm a-ketoglutarate,
and 0.2 mm pyridoxal
phosphate.
the enzyme
solutions
then were concentrated
to a volume
of 3 to
5 ml and kept at -20”.
no noticeable
loss of activity
was observed
after
several
weeks.
protein
was determined
by the method
of
lowry
et al. (4) during
purification.
protein
determination
in the
purified
enzyme
solutions
by absorption
at 280 nm (5) was unreliable
in the presence
of the substances
added to protect
against
inactivation.
for this reason protein
was approximately
estimated
from
the amino
acid analyses
(see below)
and the molecular
weights,
assuming
100% amino acid recovery
after acid hydrolysis
and an average
molecular
weight
of 110 per amino acid residue.

coli were purified
two aminotransferases
from escherichia
to homogeneity
by the criterion
of gel electrophoresis.
the
first (enzyme a) is active on l- xxxd233xxx tyrosine,
lphenylalanine,
and l-tryptophan;
the second (enzyme b) is
active on the aromatic amino acids. enzyme a is identical in
substrate specificity with transaminase
a and is mainly an
aspartate aminotransferase;
enzyme b has never been described before and is an aromatic amino acid aminotransferase. the two enzymes are different in the v,,, and k,
values with their common substrates
and pyridoxal
phosphate, in heat stability
(enzyme a being heat-stable
and
enzyme b being heat-labile
at 55”) and in ph optima with
the amino acid substrates.
they are similar in their amino
acid composition,
each enzyme appears to consist of two
subunits, and enzyme b may be converted to enzyme a by
controlled
proteolysis
with subtilisin.
the conversion
was
detected by the generation
of new aspartate
aminotransferase activity from enzyme b and was further verified by
identification
by acrylamide
gel electrophoresis
of the newly
formed enzyme a. the two enzymes appear to be products
of two genes different in a small, probably terminal, nucleotide sequence.

phate, enzyme a still possessed 56% of the activity obtained upon
full activation with the cofactor, the corresponding
figure being
9% for enzyme b. the experiment was repeated replacing ltyrosine with l-phenylalanine
with no more success. therefore,
in kinetic experiments designed to calculate the k, and v,,,, of
 xxxd3047xxx , the plots of the velocity (vertical axis)
versus the apparent (added)  xxxd3047xxx  concentration
were extrapolated
to zero velocity. the intercept of the curve
with the horizontal concentration
axis (to the left of the velocity
axis) was set as zero  xxxd3047xxx  concentration
and the
new real cofactor concentrations
were written on the horizontal
axis. double reciprocal plots then were constructed to calculate
the approximate k, and- v,,,, values for  xxxd3047xxx .
kinetic experiments-double
recinrocal
nlots according to
lineweaver and burk (12) were used for the calculation of kinetic
constants. since in transamination
reactions more than one substrates is involved, the k, and v,,,,, values given in table i
are apparent values at ph 7.3 and were calculated for each variable
substrate, while  xxxd3047xxx  and a-ketoglutarate
were at
saturating and l-tyrosine at 6.0 mm concentrations.

purqicafion
and resolution oj two enzymes on preparafive
isoelectric focusing column-purification
and resolution
by
focusing in the small (110 ml) column resulted in partially overlapping bands so that it was possible to obtain only small amount,s
of enzyme from either band without cross-contamination.
in the
large (440 ml) preparative column, which could be loaded with 5
to 6 times more enzyme units, superior resolution was obtained
and sufficient amounts of enzymes were recovered for kinetic and
other experiments. fig. 1 shows the separation obtained in the
large column, and this profile was reproducible.
the intermediate
low activity fractions were rejected and only the fractions of the
highest activity from each peak were pooled, dialyzed, and
concentrated by ultrafiltration
and tested for protein and enzyme
activity bands by gel electrophoresis.
each of the two enzymes
gave a single protein band and a single enzyme activity band
when stained in the presence of l- xxxd3459xxx phenylalanine,
and

and single protein bands with acrylamide concentrations varying from 5 to 11% (not shown). therefore, by the

enzyme assays-tyrosine:2-oxoglutarate
aminotransferase
was assayed by the method of diamondstone
(6). the reaction
mixture contained in 3.2 ml the following: 0.2 m potassium phos
phate buffer (ph 7.3), g.0 mm l-tyrosine, 9.4 mm a-ketoglutarate,
38 pm  xxxd3047xxx , and enzyme. the mixture was preincubated at 37” for 10 min and the reaction was stopped with 0.2
ml of 10 n naoh. after 30 min at room temperature the optical
density was read against a control to which naoh had been added
prior to a-ketoglutarate.
a molar extinction coefficient of 19,900
m-’ cm-i was used.
phenylalanine
aminotransferase
was assayed as the tyrosine
aminotransferase
except that tyrosine was replaced by 6 mm
phenylalanine and the optical density was read at 315 nm. a molar
extintion coefficient of 17,500 m-l cm-l was used.
tryptophan
aminotransferase
was assayed also aa the tyrosine
aminotransferase
except that tyrosine was replaced by 6 mm ltryptophan and the optical density was read at 335 nm. a molar
extinction coefficient of 10,000 m-’ cm-i was used.
aspartate:2-oxoglutarate
aminotransferase
( xxxg934xxx .1) was
assayed by the method of karmen (7) by coupling with malate
dehydrogenase at 25”. the reaction mixture contained in 3.0 ml
the following: 0.1 m potassium phosphate buffer (ph 7.6), 178 mm
n-aspartate, 6.4 mm ru-ketoglutarate,
38 pm  xxxd3047xxx ,
0.24 mm nadh, 10 units of  xxxg1739xxx , and enzyme.
the reaction was started by adding the enzyme and was followed
bv the fall of ontical densitv at 340 nm. a molar extinction coefficient of 6.2 x i03 m-i cm-i was used.
one enzyme unit is defined as that amount of enzyme which
catalyzes the conversion of 1 pmol of substrate to product per min
at the temperature of the assay.
acrylamide gel electrophoresis-the
method of davis (s) was
used with an acrylamide concentration
of 10% in a polyanalyst
electrophoresis apparatus (buchler instruments) at 1-z”. the gels
were prepared in glass tubes (75 or 100 x 5 mm) at 3 ma per gel,
with bromphenol blue as the tracking dye. proteins were visualized with coomassie brilliant
blue r. aminotransferase
activity
was detected by incubating the gels in the mixture used by ryan
et al. (9) for 20 to 30 min. purple rings were formed at the position
of transaminase activity. staining for aspartate aminotransferase
was poor compared with the excellent staining obtained for the
activities toward the aromatic amino acids and we prolonged the
incubation with aspartate to 45 to 60 min which practice also
resulted in much darker backgrounds.
inferior staining in the
presence of aspartate has been observed also by others (2). the
molecular weight of subunits was estimated by sodium dodecyl
sulfate gel electrophoresis as described by weber and osborn (10).
heat sensitivity tests-the
purified enzyme solutions were
diluted io-fold with 0.2 m potassium phosphate buffer, p1-i 7.3,
to a final volume of 4.0 ml and serum bovine albumin was added
to a final concentration of 5 mg/ml. the solutions were placed in
thin walled glass tubes (20 x 100 mm) supplied with small magnetic stirring bars and were immersed into a water bath at 100”
with constant stirring until the temperature was raised to about
52”. this required about 20 s. the tubes then were transferred to a
water bath at 55” and kept for 10 min with constant stirring.
aliquots were withdrawn
at specified time intervals, quickly
chilled in ice, and subsequently assayed. an aliquot was kept in
ice throughout
and served as the zero time control. activities
were expressed as percentages of the control.
amino acid analysis-samples
of enzyme a (0.2 ml) and enzyme b (0.6 ml) were hydrolyzed with 6 n hci at 110’ for 24 hours
in tubes sealed after evacuation. after hydrolysis the tubes were
opened and hcl was removed in a vacuum desiccator and the
sample was dissolved in 0.3 m sodium citrate buffer, ph 2.0.
analysis of the hydrolysate was carried out on a tsm amino acid
autoanalyzer.
apoenzyme formation-the
purified enzyme solutions were
allowed to form the pyridoxamine
form, which is believed to be
more dissociable than the pyridoxal form (ii), in the presence of
l-tyrosine. purified enzymes a and b were diluted 20-fold and 40fold, respectively, with 0.1 m potassium phosphate buffer, ph 7.3,
supplemented with 1 mm edta, 1 mm dithiothreitol,
and 5 mm
n-tyrosine to a volume of 8.0 ml and were allowed to stand at 4”
for 4 hours. they then were dialyzed for 19 hours against two
changes of 2 liters each of the above buffer minus l-tyrosine. full
reactivation of both enzymes was obtained upon saturation with
 xxxd3047xxx . in the absence of added pyridoxal phos-

4130
were obtained free of each other and foreign proteins. these
preparations
were used for the study of subunit structure, heat
sensitivity tests, kinetic experiments, amino acid composition,
and conversion experiments with subtilisin.

ing-isoelectric
focusing, not shown here, on a small (110 ml)
column, resolved an enzyme preparation
from deae-cellulose
column chromatography
into two peaks, a and 1~ (enzymes a
and b), when the fractions were assayed for transaminase activity with l-tyrosine,
l-phenylalanine,
and l-tryptophan.
assaying for aspartate aminotransferase
resulted in a single peak
completely coincident with peak a. the coincidence of aspartate
and aromatic amino acid activities in enzyme a was further
confirmed by gel electrophoresis of enzyme a. staining the gels
for protein,
aspartate
aminotransferase,
and a mixture
of
aspartate and tyrosme aminotransferases
resulted in a single
band in each case (fig. 2).
kinetic
experiments-table
i lists the k, and v,,,
values
and their b:a ratios for enzymes a and b. the v,,,
values
clearly indicate that the major activity toward the aromatic
amino acids resides in enzyme 13, the b:a ratio varying from
about 14 to 25. in the presence of equimolar amounts of the two
enzymes, a maximum of only about 7% of the total v,,, toward
phenylalanine
and only a few per cent toward tryptophan
and
tyrosine would be contributed by enzyme a. on the other hand,
the major activity of enzyme a is toward aspartate as attested
by the high i’,,,,, value for this amino acid compared to the v,,,,,
values for the aromatic amino acids (table i). since aspartate
aminotransferase
was assayed at 25”, whereas the aromatic
aminotransferases were assayed at 37”, the relative magnitude of
v inax for aspartate is actually underestimated
in table i by a
factor of about 2 (if about 2.0 be considered the value of temperature coefficient q10 in this instance). the v,,, values for the
two keto acids and  xxxd3047xxx  (in the presence of
tyrosine as the amino acid substrate) were also higher with
enzyme b than with enzyme a as indicated by their high b:a

ratios. the k, values for a-ketoglutarate
and  xxxd3047xxx  were 35- and 40.fold higher with enzyme b than with
enzyme a, respectively, indicating significantly higher affinities
of the keto acid and t,he cofactor for enzyme a than for enzyme
13 (table i). the lower k, value of the cofactor with enzyme a is
in agreement with its tighter physical binding during dialysis in
our experiments for apoenzyme formation. the same relationship, qualitatively,
was found in the k, values of the other keto
acid substrate oxalacetate (table i).
subunit
structure-each
enzyme on acrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of sodium  xxxd3215xxx  yielded a single
protein band which corresponded to a molecular weight of 42,000
to 45,000 (range of five experiments). since the molecular weights
of enzyme a and 1~ were estimated to be about 82,000 and
88,000, respectively (l), each appears to consist of two subunits
of equal size. in two experiments, one of which is shown in fig. 3,
we were able to calculate a slightly higher subunit molecular
weight for enzyme 13 (43,000) than for enzyme a (42,000), in

4131
keeping with the higher molecular weight of enzyme b. the
failure to calculate consistently
a higher subunit molecular
weight for enzyme b than for enzyme a is due to the short
distance traveled by proteins of so similar size in the sodium
 xxxd3215xxx  gels (about 1.7 cm in 5 hours at 8 ma per gel).
plf activity curves-fig.
4 illustrates
the dependence of
activity of the two enzymes on ph. the ph optima for enzyme a
with its four substrates vary from 8.0 (toward aspartate) t.o 9.0
(toward tyrosine) with 8.5 being the ph optimum
toward
phenylalanine and tryptophan
(fig. 4a). for enzyme 1’1 the ph
optimum toward tyrosine drops to 8.0 with 7.5 and 8.0 being the
optima toward phenylalanine and tryptophan
(fig. 4b). in view
of the physical evidence of homogeneity, the differences in the
ph optima of each enzyme with its substrates reflect the differences in the pk values of the substrates rather than the existence
of different enzymes.
heat sensitivity tests-the
time courses of act,ivity loss of the
two enzymes toward their substrates (tryptophan
was not included) at 55” are shown in fig. 5. enzyme b rapidly lost
activity with tyrosine and phenylalanine
as substrates so that,
after 10 min, less than 10% of the original activity was left.

enzyme a, however, was relatively heat stable, with 52 and 647”
of the original activity remaining after 10 min with tyrosine and
phenylalanine,
respectively, as substrates. for each enzyme the
initial rate of inactivation
as well as the final activity loss (especially for enzyme a) was more pronounced with tyrosine than
with phenylalanine
as substrate and this was verified in another
experiment (not shown). more striking was the almost complete
absence of inactivation of enzyme a with aspartate as substrate
seen against its partial loss of activity with the two aromatic
amino acids (fig. 5). kinetic evidence (to be reported in detail
elsewhere) indicates that of the two ionizing groups at the active
site of enzyme a, only one is affected by the binding of aspartate,
but both are affected by the binding of tyrosine. the less stringent
requirement
for aspartate binding most probably accounts for
the heat stability of the enzyme versus this substrate. a heat
sensitivity test such as ours applied to a crude or semipurified
preparation
containing
the two enzymes would yield a heatstable aspartate aminotransferase,
a more labile phenylalanine
aminotransferase,
and an even more labile  xxxg2250xxx  and it would be misinterpreted
to suggest the existence of
one enzyme specific for aspartate and one enzyme (and possibly
two) specific for the aromatic amino acids. such a plot, derived
from an experiment with a crude extract, was published recently
(2) in support of the nonidentity of the two types of activity.
amino acid composition-the
amino acid composition of the
two enzymes was looked into with the purpose of obtaining some
insight into the structure of the two enzymes. their similarity
in size and especially in charge suggested that they might be
similar proteins. the data of table ii do indeed indicate that
their amino acid compositions are very similar. the significant
differences in the number of amino acid residues appear to be
limited to  xxxd2431xxx , glycine, alanine, valine, and possibly
to lysine and phenylalanine.
this suggested to us that extensive
homology might exist between the two proteins and we were
successful in converting enzyme b to enzyme a by controlled
proteolysis.

activity in the first 10 min and the

incubation
in the absence of subtilisin
(control) resulted in some loss of  xxxg2250xxx 
activity, whereas the aspartate aminotransferase
activity did not
change in agreement with the relative heat stabilities of these
two activities (fig. 5). incubations with subtilisin concentrations
double and quadruple that used in fig. 6 resulted in the generation of much lower net aspartate aminotransferase
(not shown).
these results suggested that enzyme a with its typical aspartate
aminotransferase
activity was the product of the controlled
proteolysis of enzyme b by subtilisin. this was demonstrated by
gel electrophoresis of subtilisin-treated
enzyme b. fig. 7 (gel 2)
shows clearly an enzyme activity band with the mobility of
enzyme a. this band is absent from the zero time control (gel 1)
and the subtilisin
control
(gel 4).

(fig. 5) ; (d) optima ph for the same substrates (fig. 4). on the
other hand, the two enzymes are similar in amino acid composition, size, and net charge, similarities which readily explain the
failure of rudman and meister to distinguish between them in
their classic study on transamination
in e. coli (13) with the
then available techniques. in addition, there appears to exist
extensive homology in the primary structures of the two en
zymes.
enzyme a, formerly reported as form ia (l), was first described by rudman and meister and given the name  xxxg934xxx  (13). enzyme b, formerly reported as form ib (l),
has not been previously recognized in e. coli as a distinct enzyme.
according to the recommendations
of the commission of biochemical nomenclature
the term “multiple
forms” should be
used for proteins possessing the same enzyme activity (14).
accordingly, the two proteins of fig. 1 do not represent multiple
forms of an aromatic aminotransferase but, rather, two different
enzymes, one of which (enzyme a) is active mainly with aspartate
and the other (enzyme b) with the aromatic amino acids (table
i). our previous reluctance to identify aspart’ate aminotransferase with enzyme a (1) led us to believe that the aromatic activities of the two proteins represented multiple forms of an
essentially aromatic aminotransferase,
with aspartate aminotransferase being perhaps an additional
distinct protein. the
physical evidence for the identity of aspartate aminotransferase
with enzyme a rests with two powerful analytical methods,
namely, isoelectric focusing and acrylamide gel electrophoresis,
failing to resolve the activity toward aspartate from the activity

terminal step of phenylalanine,
as well as of tyrosine, biosynthesis.
the conversion of enzyme b to enzyme a by controlled proteolysis in the presence of subtilisin is of interest. the conversion
experiments were suggested by, and are in agreement with, the
similarity
in amino acid composition
of the two enzymes. it
appears likely that cleavage of a terminal polypeptide tract from
each subunit of enzyme b is responsible for the generation of
enzyme a under our conditions of limited proteolysis.
it is
unlikely that the process is of physiological
significance. since
enzyme b is selectively repressed by l-tyrosine whereas enzyme
a is unaffected (1) the two enzymes are products of two genes
different only in a small, probably terminal, nucleotide sequence.
the enzymological implications
of the conversion are of interest
also. it seems clear that cleavage of polypeptide(s)
from enzyme
b is sufficient to generate a new activity, aspartate aminotransferase, typical of enzyme a. in this respect, the conversion is
reminiscent
of the long known zymogen-enzyme
relationships.
the very low aspartate aminotransferase
activity of enzyme b
noted in fig. 6 in the absence of subtilisin may mean that masking of the activity in enzyme b is not 100% complete or that
enzyme b was slightly contaminated
with enzyme a during
isolation from the isolectric focusing column. to the best of our
knowledge this is the first instance of an enzyme being converted
to another distinct, physiologically
occurring enzyme by controlled proteolysis.

toward the aromatic amino acids in enzyme a. we are thus in
disagreement with a recent report (2) claiming the nonidentity of
aspartate and aromatic amino acid activities in enzyme a. we
propose multispecific
aspartate aminotransferase
as the recommended name (14) to replace the name  xxxg934xxx .
enzyme b, an aromatic amino acid aminotransferase, has never
been described before in e. coli and its “dissection” from enzyme
a has some important consequences regarding the actual aminotransferase involved in the regulation of tyrosine and phenylalanine biosyntheses. it has been reported (15) that  xxxg934xxx  of e. coli is specifically repressed by l-tyrosine and so
is enzyme b of the present study (1). the enzyme, assayed only
as tyrosine and phenylalanine
aminotransferases,
was found in
crude extracts to be heat-labile and to account for most of the
activity toward the two aromatic amino acids (15). the heat
lability and substrate specificity conform with the properties of
our enzyme b (table i, fig. 5). it is now apparent that, by
assaying only for aromatic aminotransferase
activities, the above
investigators
(15) were observing in the crude extracts the
repression not of  xxxg934xxx  but of t,he new enzyme b. they
were led to their erroneous conclusion because of the omission to
assay for aspartate aminotransferase.
accordingly, references in
the literature on the repression by tyrosine of  xxxg934xxx 
assayed as  xxxg2250xxx 
(which is the usual practice)
reflect the repression of enzyme b, not of  xxxg934xxx  which
is insensitive to repression by tyrosine.
in the same study (15) evidence was presented purporting
to
show that there exists in e. coli a specific phenylalanine
aminotransferase distinct from transaminase
a with the following
properties studied in crude extracts: (a) relatively heat-stable at
60” (25 to 30% loss of activity after 10 min) (fig. 1 of ref. 15);
(b) nonrepressible
by tyrosine or any other amino acid; (c) it
contributed
about 20% of the total activity toward phenylalanine; (d) its resolution from the activity toward tyrosine
could not be achieved by ammonium sulfate fractionation
and
deae-cellulose
chromatography.
these are properties of our
enzyme a ( xxxg934xxx ) which: (a) is relatively heat-stable
with phenylalanine
(about 35% loss of activity at 55’$&, fig. 5) ;
(5) is not repressed by tyrosine (1) ; (c) contributes little to the
total activity toward phenylalanine
(table i); and (d) was
separated with some difficulty from the strictly aromatic activity
of enzyme b, with techniques not used or unavailable
to the
previous investigators
(15). it must be emphasized that we are
not claiming that a distinct phenylalanine
aminotransferase
does
not exist in e. coli, only that the earlier studies (15), rather than
providing evidence for such an enzyme, merely described properties of  xxxg934xxx  itself against the background of the unsuspected enzyme b. in the absence of rigorous enzymological
evidence and in the light of the present data its occurrence in
these organisms must remain in doubt. consequently, and until a
specific phenylalanine
aminotransferase
is unequivocally
established, it is enzyme b that appears to be involved in the

multispecific aspartate and aromatic amino acid aminotransferases in escherichia
coli.
