intracellular calcium increases mediated by a
recombinant human  xxxg321xxx 
steven d. stroop and emma e. moore

abstract
stable transfectants expressing a recombinant human  xxxg321xxx  respond to calcitonin via increased cyclic
adenosine 3'3' monophosphate (camp,ec,, = 0.06 nm  xxxd407xxx  [sct]) and a transient mobilization
of intracellular calcium ([ca2']i) coincident with turnover of inositol phosphate (ip; ec,, = 6 nm sct).
millimolar increases in extracellular calcium ([ca2']o, ec,, = 8 mm) cause a rapid elevation in [ca2+]i after a
calcitonin dose-dependent pretreatment of cells (pretreatment ec,, = 0.2 nm sct). cells exhibit persistent
sensitivity to increased [ca2+]o up to 3 h after hormone exposure and even after multiple cycles of increased
[caz+]o followed by wash. calcitonin pretreatment of cells also allows apparent influx of elevated extracellular
strontium and manganese, but little or no effect is observed on addition of barium, cadmium, or lanthanum.
human amylin (100 nm) causes a rapid and transient increase in [ca2+]i comparable to that of calcitonin;
however, no significant response to increased [ca2+]o is observed after amylin addition. human calcitonin
gene-related product (hcgrp) (300 nm) and  xxxd1742xxx  do not increase [ca2+]i or activate a sensitivity to
increased [caz+]0. nevertheless, human amylin and human calcitonin gene-related product (hcgrp) activate
adenylate cyclase with ec,,s of 0.7 nm and 8 nm, respectively. the calcium-channel drugs verapamil, bay k 8644,
diltiazem, and nifedipine have little effect on [caz+]i increases. the calcitonin-induced transient mobilization of
calcium is inhibited by treatment of cells with cholera toxin or 8-(diethylamino)-octyl-3,4,5-trimethoxybenzoate
(tmb-8); whereas, the response to subsequent increased [ca2+lois inhibited by lanthanum chloride (200 pm)
and lower ph (6.0). these studies suggest that a recombinant human  xxxg321xxx  activates three unique
signal transduction pathways in bhk cells. subnanomolar calcitonin persistently activates adenylate cyclase and
a novel pathway coupled to calcium influx while much higher calcitonin levels increase inositol phosphate turnover
and generate a transient mobilization of [ca2+]i stores.

introduction
alcitonin is

best characterized as a potent inhibitor of
bone resorption through its action on osteoclast plasma
membrane receptors.'" the  xxxg321xxx  is most
concentrated in the bone, hypothalamus, and kidney(2)and
is a member of a new family of related g-protein coupled
receptors which includes the  xxxg1885xxx  (pth),
secretin, and glucagon receptors.") some of these receptors
have also been shown to activate both cyclic 3'-5' adenosine
monophosphate (camp) and inositol tris phosphate (ip3)
second messenger pathways.") the human  xxxg321xxx  has been shown to exist in at least two isoforms

c

which differ by the presence o r absence of a 16 amino acid
insert within the first putative intracellular loop
the insert negative form appears to be predominant in a
variety of tissues known to express the receptor.")
specific cell types regulated by extracellular calcium
([ca"]o) include the osteoclast, parathyroid hormonesecreting chief cells, and the calcitonin-secreting thyroid c
cells. these latter two cell types are reported to respond to
small increases in [ca'+]o concentrations via increased
intracellular calcium ([ca"]i). significant advances in the
understanding of the regulation of these cell types is now
afforded by the expression cloning of a calcium receptor
from the parathyroid gland.'') osteoclasts are reported to

they also apparently express a cell surface calcium “receptor(s)” that inhibits hone resorption via an increase in
osteoclast [ca’+ ]i concentrations in response to miiiimoiar
increases in [c:a2+]o.‘7~i‘))
a recombinant human  xxxg321xxx  expressed in
baby hamster kidncy (bhk) cells“ ’ ) permits these cells to
“sense” millimolar increases in extracellular calcium
[caz+]o. increased [ca’+]o results in an increase in the
[ca’+]i of these cells; however, as previously reported,
some cell lines required calcitonin pretreatment and some
did not in order to observe this response. stable cell lines
expressing two isoforms of the rat  xxxg321xxx  also
respond to increases in extracellular calcium but only after
calcitonin treatment.‘”) higher expression levels of the
human  xxxg321xxx  result in a higher maximum
increased [ca2+]iin response to either calcitonin or subsequent increased [ca’ ‘]o.(”) the mechanism of the transient [ca”]i increase in response to calcitonin is reported
to depend on ip3 production and the release of calcium
from intracellular stores.(’3,14)
however, the mechanism of
these cells’ “sensitivity” to increased extracellular calcium
has not been determined.
we have extcnded our studies of cells expressing a recombinant human  xxxg321xxx  and have characterized the increased [ca’+]i responses to calcitonin and increased [caz+]o.these studies clarify that the “sensitivity”
of these cell lines to increased [caz+]ois calcitonin-dependent, hut at peptide concentrations well below that required
to activate a transient mobilization of [ca”]i or a significant turnover of total inositol phosphate. this sensitivity to
increased [ca2 10 remains for at least 3 h after calcitonin
exposure and cannot he washed away, nor can it be induced
by human amylin amide which activates adenylate cyclase
and generates a transient increase in [ca”]i similar to
calcitonin. these studies taken together with previous studies‘”) suggest a persistent activation of a calcium influx
pathway by subnanomolar calcitonin. this putative channel
activation pathway is dissociable from receptor mediated
pathways which transiently mobilize [ca’+]i and elevate
camp.

materials and methods

cell culture
bhk 570 ( a i c c no. crl 1632) cells were grown under
5% co, in air at 37°c in dulbecco’s minimum essential
medium (dmem) supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum (fbs), 2 mm l-glutamine and 1 mm sodium pyruvate.
the cells werc grown to confluence then trypsinized and
plated at 3 x l o 4 cellsiml in uncoated coverglass well twochamber slides (nunc, naperville, il) and were grown for
48 h under the same conditions. some wells were treated
with cholera toxin or pertussis toxin ( 5 &ml) for 3 h at
37°c prior to loading with fura-2 am by addition of toxin
directly to the slide chamher in dmem.

the bhk cell lines expressing recombinant human  xxxg321xxx  were previously described.“.’ i ) a cdna
encoding a  xxxg321xxx  (embl data library n o .
x69920) was cloned from a human mammary carcinoma
(t47d) cell line‘”’ (a7tc no. hbl-133) and was characterized as encoding a 474 amino acid protein that is 70%’
homologous to the porcine calcitonin reccptor.‘5) this rcceptor is an isoform of a human  xxxg321xxx  cloncd
from an ovarian carcinoma cell line(4)and lacks the insert o f
16 amino acids in the putative first intracellular loop region.
a stable bhk transfectant (hxl) expressed 700,000 cell
surface human calcitonin receptors and another bhk ccll
line (9b13) expressed about 150,000 receptors per cell a s
described previously.‘”’ i ) the untransfected bhk cell line
does not express detectable levels of endogenous calcitonin
receptor and little or no receptor for amylin or the calcitonin gene-related peptide (cgrp).

results

cytosolic calcium increases in two stable calcitonin
receptor transfectants
both the hxl and 9b13 transfectants respond to sct or
hct with a rapid mobilization of [ca”]i (figs. l a and
2).(’i ) these transient responses are coupled with turnover
of inositol phosphate which also increases for the hxl cell
line with an apparent ec,,, of 6.0 ? 1.4 nm sct.(’) the
high ec,, for this response is consistent with values reported for transfectants of the porcine  xxxg321xxx .(’”14) these values are significantly higher than the
ec,,, for activation of adenylate cyclase which is 0.06 ? 0.02
nm sct for the hxl cells.“)

both the hxl and 9bl3 transfectants showed rapid increased [ca’+]i (figs. 1 and 2) when extracellular calcium
([ca’+]o) is increased from 1 to 25 mm after calcitonin
treatment. calcitonin pretreatment is required in order to
observe a response to increased [ca’+]o but this “sensitivity” to [ca”]o does not require a prior mobilization of
[ca2+]i (figs. 1 and 2). pretreatment with sct is dosedependent (ec’,, = 0.19 +- 0.13 nm sct) (fig. 1, inset), and
the effective pretreatment concentrations of sct are significantly lower than those required for ip turnover and transient mobilization of [ca”]i. the hxl transfectants were
previously reported to respond to increased [caz+]owithout prior calcitonin exposure; however, after further characterization it was apparent that these cells require calcitonin pretreatment just as the 9b13 transfectants.“ i ) the
apparent calcitonin-independent responses previously observed with the hxl cells were likely due to calcitonin,
present in some reagents, which activates an unusually longlived sensitivity to increased [ca’+]o as described later.
increased [ca2+]oprior to calcitonin addition (fig. id)
sustains the response to subsequent addition of high sct in
hxl cells. increased [ca”]o added in time to intercept the
peak transient mobilization of [ca’+]i after high calcitonin
addition (fig. le) also sustains the response but does not
increase the maximum peak increased [ca”]i. thus, the
peak transient response to calcitonin does not depend on
extracellular calcium since high [ca”]o
and low
[ca2+]o(5211)
do not alter its maximum but only affect its
duration. the apparent sustained response of hxl cells to
increased [ca2+]ocompared with the transient response of
the 9b13 cells(”) can be altered by extracellular ph.

persistent activation
the “sensitivity” to increased [ca2+]o of hxl cells pretreated with 0.5 nm sct is long-lived and lasts a minimum
of 206 minutes (fig. 3). longer times were not tested. the

to near basal levels during the intervening wash periods
with 1 mm calcium buffer. the normally sustained increases in [ca"]i of hxl cells rapidly return to near basal
concentrations when [cazf]o is reduced to 1 mm. this
persistent sensitivity to increased [ca2'lo cannot be washed
away and may be related to the apparent irreversible binding of calcitonin that has been previously described.(lx'

alone or bhk cells expressing a recombinant glucagon
receptor (fig. 8). hcgrp (300 nm),  xxxd1742xxx , and kc1 do
not induce increased [ca"]i nor activate the sensitivity of

both human amylin amide and hcgrp activate adenylate cyclase with ec,,,s of 0.72 5 0.10 and 8.0 5 0.5 nm,
respectively, on hxl cells but have no effect on the camp

calcium channel drugs, such as verapamil, diltiazem,
nifedipinc, and bay k 8644 (fig. y), have little effect on
peak [ca' ' ]i responses to either calcitonin or subsequent
increased (ca'+]o even at micromolar drug concentrations.
high concentrations of these compounds may interact,
however, with numerous cellular targets and slightly alter
the responsiveness of the cells. in contrast, the response of
cells to 25 mm increased [ca" 10 following calcitonin treatment is significantly inhibited by addition of 200 p m lanthanum chloride (figs. 10 and 12), a calcium antagonist that
can nonspecifically block channel mediated entry of calcium

increased [caz+]o but does not inhibit calcitonin-induced

citonin-induced mobilization of [ca’+]i is likely complex. in
contrast, treatment of the cells with pertussis toxin, which
inactivates inhibitory (gi) g-proteins, potentiates the peak
[ca2+]i response to both calcitonin and subsequent increased [ca”]o (fig. 12) and suggests that in these cells
neither response is mediated through inhibitory (gi) gproteins.(22)doxycyclin and dantrolene also inhibit the observed responses of these cells; however, these compounds
were found to interfere directly with the emission of fura-2.

discussion
these studies extend our previous observations of the
extracellular calcium “sensing” of bhk cells expressing a
recombinant human  xxxg321xxx . we found that
calcitonin pretreatment of these cells is necessary in order
to observe a sensitivity to increased [ca’+]o. the ec,, for
pretreatment is similar to that for adenylate cyclase activation and is significantly lower than that for ip turnover.
however, this calcitonin-dependent sensitivity to increased
[ca2+]o is not due merely to elevation of camp since
neither amylin, hcgrp, nor  xxxd1742xxx  induce sensitivity to
increased [ca2+lo under conditions of maximal adenylate
cyclase activity in these cells. neither is it due simply to a
prior mobilization and refilling of calcium stores. moreover, activation of adenylate cyclase in concert with prior

transient mobilization of [ca’+]i via the  xxxg321xxx 
is neither necessary nor sufficient to activate the sensitivity
of these cells to increased [ca”]o (figs. 1, 2, 7, and 8).
these data suggest that novel receptor-mediated mechanisms are involved in the activation by calcitonin of the
“sensitivity” to increased [ca”]o. persistent activation of
adenylate cyclase by calcitonin has been reported,(ix’ and
we observe persistent activation of the sensitivity to increased [ca2+]o following calcitonin treatment. sensitivity
remains for hours after calcitonin exposure and cannot be
washed away. this can be explained in part by the ability of
calcitonin to bind with apparent irreversibility to its receptor but still necessitates the generation of a continuous
activation signal.
amylin is a peptide hormone with structural homology to
calcitonin and cgrp and has been shown to have activity
on bone cells, particularly osteoclasts.(2‘).23)high concentrations of human amylin amide generate a transient
[ca”]i increase that is similar to that seen with calcitonin
addition, but, unlike calcitonin, amylin does not significantly activate the putative calcium channel in transfectants
expressing the human  xxxg321xxx . these observations imply some interesting structure-function differences
between the human peptides calcitonin, amylin, and c g r p
and their interaction with a human receptor. however, the
differential effects of these peptides are likely to be very
dependent on the species of origin of both peptide and
receptor. all three of these peptides activate adenylate
cyclase through the human  xxxg321xxx . they are
also reported to activate increased camp in osteoclast-like
mononuclear cells.(23)these observations may be relevant
to the differential effects of calcitonin and amylin on isolated osteoclasts(’”) where inhibition by calcitonin occurs
through decreased motility (q) and retraction ( r ) but inhibition by amylin affects only the motility (q). more studies on the structures of these peptides and their signaling
properties on the  xxxg321xxx  seems warranted.
response to increased [ca”]o is apparently due in large
part to the increased influx of calcium into the cell via a
cation or calcium channel that is persistently activated by
calcitonin. potentially physiological concentrations of calcitonin activate both adenylate cyclase and the putative calcium channel pathways in these cells (ec,,,s of 0.06 and
0.19 nm sct, respectively) while much higher concentrations are required for turnover of total ips and the transient
mobilization of [ca’+]i stores (ec,, of 6 nm).(5,13.14)evidence for influx includes the calcitonin-dependent quenching of fura fluorescence by manganese and the inhibition of
the response to increased [ca2’]o by lanthanum which is
known to block channel-mediated calcium entry.(21)the
observed responses of calcitonin pretreated cells to increased strontium and the apparent lack of a significant
effect of barium, cadmium, or lanthanum in the absence of
high calcium are also consistent with an increased influx
phenomenon (figs. 3-6 and 10). if mobilization of calcium
stores is involved in the observed response of these cells to
increased [ca2+]o, then neither barium, cadmium, nor lanthanum are apparently capable of substituting to mobilize
these stores. this apparent increased influx is not due to
cell death since cells readily return to near basal [ca2’]i
