the bcr-abl  xxxg2198xxx  inhibitor imatinib and promising new agents
against philadelphia chromosome-positive leukemias

received: june 21, 2007

abstract chronic myeloid leukemia (cml) was the first
human malignant disease to be linked to a single, acquired
genetic abnormality. identification of the bcr-abl kinase
fusion protein and its pivotal role in the pathogenesis of
cml provided new opportunities to develop moleculartargeted therapies.  xxxd2333xxx  (im, gleevec, novartis pharmaceuticals, basel, switzerland), which specifically
inhibits the autophosphorylation of the abl tk, has
improved the treatment of cml. however, resistance is
often reported in patients with advanced-stage disease.
several novel tk inhibitors have been developed that override im resistance mechanisms caused by point mutations
within the abl kinase domain. inhibitors of abl tk are
divided into two main groups, namely, atp-competitive
and atp noncompetitive inhibitors. the atp-competitive
inhibitors fall into two subclasses, the src/abl inhibitors,
and the 2-phenylaminopyrimidine-based compounds.
 xxxd1815xxx  (formerly  xxxd1815xxx ), ap23464,  xxxd359xxx , and
 xxxd1131xxx  are classified as src/abl inhibitors, while  xxxd2724xxx  (amn107) and inno-406 (ns-187) belong to the
latter subclass of inhibitors. of these agents,  xxxd1815xxx  and
 xxxd2724xxx  underwent clinical trials earlier than the others
and favorable results are now accumulating. clinical studies
of the other compounds, including  xxxd359xxx  and inno-406,
have been performed in rapid succession. because of their
strong affinities for the atp-binding site compared to im,
most atp-competitive inhibitors may be effective in imresistant patients. however, an atp-competitive inhibitor
that can inhibit the phosphorylation of t315i bcr-abl
has not yet been developed. instead, atp noncompetitive
inhibitors, such as on012380, aurora kinase inhibitor
mk0457 (vx-680), and  xxxg1368xxx  inhibitor  xxxd1929xxx , have been developed to address this problem. this

introduction
chronic myelogenous leukemia (cml) is a clonal disorder
caused by the malignant transformation of pluripotent
hematopoietic stem cells.1 cml accounts for approximately
20% of all leukemias diagnosed in adults. most cml
patients are diagnosed in the chronic phase (cp) by an
increased number of leukocytes and/or platelets and a bone
marrow blast count of less than 10%. the accelerated phase
(ap) may be marked by an increase in the number of blasts
from 10% to 30%, and thrombocytopenia. in the blast
phase (bp), 30% or more of the blood and bone marrow
cells are blasts. typically, this disease progresses through cp
into ap within a couple of years, and then rapidly enters bp,
for which the median survival is 2 to 4 months.2
cytogenetically, cml is characterized by the philadelphia (ph) chromosome, which arises from the reciprocal
translocation t(9;22)(q34;q11).3 this translocation fuses the
abelson tk gene (abl) on chromosome 9 with the  xxxg256xxx  gene (bcr) on chromosome 22, and
generates a fusion bcr-abl protein with constitutive tk
activity, which abnormally activates a number of cytoplasmic and nuclear signal-transduction cascades and affects
the growth and survival of hematopoietic cells.4–6 the ph
chromosome is present in more than 90% of adult cml
patients and in 5% of children, in 15% to 30% of adultonset acute lymphoblastic leukemia (all) patients, and in
2% of patients with acute myelogenous leukemia (aml).
depending on the site of the breakpoint in the bcr gene,
the resultant fusion protein can vary in size from 185-kda
to 230-kda.7 most cml patients have a fusion protein of

328

210-kda, and approximately 30% of ph+ all cases and a
few cml cases are associated with the 185-kda bcr-abl
protein.8,9 a subset of patients with indolent cml express
the 230-kda bcr-abl oncoprotein.10 furthermore, patients
with ph+ aml express a 210-kda oncoprotein. differences
in the composition of the fusion bcr-abl protein and its
intrinsic kinase activity may determine the type of leukemia
that arises with each bcr-abl isoform in these ph+
leukemias.11
from the 1960s to the 1970s,  xxxd390xxx  (bus) and
hydroxyurea (hu) were used as the standard anticancer
agents for cml.12 however, they did not significantly
prolong the survival of cml patients despite the reduction
in the number of leukemic cells.13 in the 1980s, interferon-alpha
( xxxg1137xxx ) became a promising new agent for cml because
it could induce hematological and cytogenetic remission,
resulting in a prolonged survival in comparison with the
conventional chemotherapy of bus and hu. however, not
all patients responded to  xxxg1137xxx  and the daily self-injection
was quite a burden to patients. in addition, a considerable
number of patients claimed serious toxicities and a reduction in efficacy with increasing duration of cp.14
another important strategy was allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-hsct), which was introduced for the treatment of cml in the late 1970s.15 despite
being potentially curative, however, allo-hsct is not an
ideal option for the majority of patients due to the lack of
an hla-matched donor or the risk of transplantationrelated mortality, especially in the aged.16
multiple experimental models have supported the pivotal
role of bcr-abl in the pathogenesis of ph+ leukemias.17–19
therefore, inhibition of bcr-abl-based abnormal tyrosine
kinase (tk) activity posed an attractive strategy. however,
protein tks in general were largely ignored in drug development because of concerns about drug specificity and
toxicity.20 tks are indispensable for numerous processes in
the normal cell; therefore, selectivity is an essential requirement for tk inhibitors. in this context, gene silencing strategies using antisense oligodeoxynucleotides (as odns)
seemed to be attractive. as odns complementary to the
mrna of the rearranged fusion site of bcr-abl were introduced into cml cells, where they formed mrna/as odn
heteroduplexes that resulted in the degradation of the
bcr-abl mrna by rnase h. despite the encouraging
results in cml murine models, this technique was difficult
to adapt to clinical settings.21 furthermore, this strategy
required large quantities of as odn to reach an effective
dose, resulting in toxic effects due to lack of sequence-specificity and nonspecific binding.22 therefore, we have been
eagerly awaiting the development of a novel strategy that
can eradicate the ph clone, specifically and safely.

development of  xxxd2333xxx  (im)
the nonreceptor tks, such as c-abl, are maintained in an
inactive state by cellular inhibitor proteins and lipids and
through intramolecular autoinhibition.23 a common mecha-

nism of tk activation in hematological malignancies is the
fusion of a receptor or nonreceptor tk with a partner
protein, usually as a consequence of reciprocal chromosomal translocation. in the fusion protein bcr-abl, a
tetramerization domain in bcr overcomes the autoinhibition of abl’s catalytic activity through oligomerization and
autophosphorylation.24
a 2-phenylaminopyrimidine-based atp-competitive
inhibitor of the abl protein kinase, im (gleevec, or glivec;
novartis pharmaceuticals, basel, switzerland), has been
created using the structure of the atp-binding site of the
abl protein kinase.23–25 (fig. 1a). im binds to and stabilizes
the inactive form of bcr-abl rather than occupying the
whole atp-binding pocket.26 functionally, im acts by
annulling the effects of the bcr-abl oncoprotein through
the inhibition of bcr-abl autophosphorylation and substrate phosphorylation. im inhibits the proliferation and
then induces the apoptosis of bcr-abl-positive cells.27–29
phase i trials of im commenced in 1998, showing significant antileukemic activity and good tolerability in cml
patients in whom treatment with  xxxg1137xxx  had failed.30 phase
ii studies were then designed. a high number of patients in
cp, who had failed  xxxg1137xxx  therapy, showed a complete cytogenetic response (ccgr; no cells positive for ph based on
the analysis of 20 metaphases at least) rate of 41% and
a major cytogenetic response (mcgr; ph < 35%) rate of
60%. these responses were satisfactorily durable, resulting
in a progression-free survival of 89.2% of patients with
cml at 18 months.31 with these promising results, a new
drug application was filed, on february 27, 2001, a mere 32
months after novartis began testing im in humans, and then
on may 10, 2001, the united states food and drug administration (fda) approved im immediately after completion
of the review.32 im was then approved for use in europe,
australia, and japan within the following year. subsequently,
the international randomized ifn versus sti571 (iris)
phase iii study was performed, and demonstrated that im
was significantly superior to the combination of  xxxg1137xxx  and
 xxxd1790xxx .33 the iris study provided overwhelmingly positive results for im, which was then recognized as the frontline therapy for cml.34
accordingly, targeting bcr-abl with im was an innovative approach to generating a novel therapeutic strategy for
cml. with a present follow-up of 5 years, the best observed
rate of complete hematological response (chr) was 97%,
and the cumulative ccgr rate was 87%. at 60 months, the
estimated overall survival of patients who received im as
an initial therapy was 89% and the rate of survival without
transformation was 93%.35 however, the response rate to
im in late cp (cp cml diagnosis >12 months) or ap/bp
patients was less than that in early cp patients. indeed,
current observations suggest that im has some limitations
in treating patients in late cp as well as in treating most
patients in advanced-phase (ap/bp).36
im may also be effective in diseases caused by activated
platelet-derived growth factor receptors (pdgfrs) and
c-kit. pdgfralpha is activated by cryptic interstitial chromosome 4 deletions, resulting in a fip1l1-pdgfralpha fusion
tk in some patients with hypereosinophilic syndrome or

resistance to im therapy
despite the apparent success of im therapy, reality lies
somewhere between the extremes of triumph and tribulation. indeed, the clinical success of im is hampered by
resistance to the treatment. recent recommendations for
definitions of resistance versus a suboptimal response to im
have been proposed (table 1).40 resistance to im is defined
as a failure to achieve chr at 3 months, a cytogenetic
response (cgr) at 6 months, or an mcgr at 12 months.41
acquired relapse is defined as an initial response to im
followed by a loss of efficacy with time of exposure to im.
the estimated annual rate of treatment failure after the
start of im therapy was 3.3% in the first year, 7.5% in the
second year, 4.8% in the third year, 1.5% in the fourth year,
and 0.9% in the fifth year. the corresponding annual rates
of progression to ap or bp were 1.5%, 2.8%, 1.6%, 0.9%,
and 0.6%, respectively. these results are promising
for cml patients in cp administered with im for several

years. however, a considerable number of patients in
ap/bp cml exhibit resistance to im. the estimated 4-year
resistance rates were 20% in late cp and 70% to 90% in
ap/bp.35
resistance to im may occur through several mechanisms; overexpression of bcr-abl and amplification of the
bcr-abl gene,42 involvement of p-glycoprotein,43–45 activation of lyn,46–48 an increase of alpha-acid glycoprotein in the
serum,49 a low expression of human organic cation transporter 1 (hoct1),50 and most intriguingly, point mutations
within the abl kinase domain that interfere with im binding
but not its kinase activity.42 initial reports suggested that
these mutations were present in up to 90% of patients
failing im therapy, but recent studies have shown this
proportion to be approximately 40%.51–55

bcr-abl mutations
the first reported clinical resistance bcr-abl mutation was
t315i (a single amino acid substitution of the threonine 315
residue to an isoleucine).42 this blocked im binding by suppressing a drug-kinase hydrogen bond and by creating a
steric clash between im and the bulky hydrocarbon side
chain of the isoleucine residue in the mutant, while preserv-

• failure implies that the patient should be moved to other treatments whenever available
• suboptimal response implies that the patient may still have a substantial benefit from continuing im treatment, but that the long-term outcome is not
likely to be optimal, so the patient becomes eligible for other treatments

ing the atp-binding and kinase activity of the bcr-abl
protein (fig. 2).56 a number of subsequent studies have
shown that a mutation in the kinase domain is a major
resistance mechanism in cml. to date, more than 40 different point mutations coding for distinct single amino acid
substitutions in the bcr-abl kinase domain have been isolated from relapsed cml patients resistant to im treatment
and from patients with ph+ all (fig. 3).56–58 preclinical
studies have demonstrated that mutations outside the kinase
domain can also result in molecular conformations of
bcr-abl that impair im binding.59 therefore, screening for
mutations outside the kinase domain may be necessary to
fully account for im resistance in patients.
mutations are more frequent in relapsed patients compared to those with initial resistance. the observation that
89% of patients with mutations eventually relapse suggests
that harboring any bcr-abl mutation has prognostic value
with respect to determining disease progression.60 thus, a
search for mutations could be performed when either a 3log reduction in bcr-abl transcripts is not achieved within
1 year after initiating im treatment or when there is a
twofold increase in bcr-abl transcript levels at any time
during the clinical course after commencing treatment.40 in
early cp, mutations are rare. however, the proportion of
patients with mutations in late cp, ap, and bp has ranged
between 22% and 53%.61
highly sensitive detection methods can increase the
detection rate of point mutations. for example, allelespecific oligonucleotide polymerase chain reaction (pcr)
methods have permitted the detection of bcr-abl kinase
domain mutations prior to im therapy in patients with cml
and all. mutations can also be detected in an automated
manner by denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography (d-hplc). d-hplc compares favorably to dna
sequencing, as samples can be rapidly analyzed for singlenucleotide polymorphisms.62 we recently developed a
highly sensitive and automated method utilizing the differences between mutated and wild-type sequences with
quenching probes for point-of-care testing (unpublished
data). such sensitive and accurate mutation detection
methods are indispensable in the clinical setting.

new  xxxg2198xxx  (tk) inhibitors for the
management of cml
higher doses of im and combination therapy with other
agents have been used to overcome im resistance.63–66
although these therapies have some efficacy, the strategies
are, in principle, limited to patients with bcr-abl point
mutations. therefore, it is necessary to develop more effective and specific abl tk inhibitors that are more potent
than im in blocking bcr-abl kinase activity, including variants with point mutations in the kinase domain which are
available for oral administration. in the following sections,
we provide an update on the development of new therapeutic strategies, especially focusing on second and third
generations of small molecules. additionally, we discuss the
future prospects of further strategies for the management
of ph+ leukemias.
atp competitive inhibitors
inhibitors of abl tk are divided into two main groups;
namely, atp-competitive and atp noncompetitive inhibitors. the atp-competitive inhibitors are further classified
into two subclasses, the src/abl inhibitors (which were
originally developed as src inhibitors and have been
modified to enhance their effects against abl), and the 2phenylaminopyrimidine-based compounds.
src/abl inhibitors (src family tk inhibitors with abl
inhibitor activity)
src is an attractive target for cml therapy. src kinases are
a family of nine structurally homologous nonreceptor intracellular tks (src, fyn, yes, blk, yrk, fgr,  xxxg1028xxx , lck, and
lyn). they play pivotal roles in the signal transduction
pathways of cell growth, differentiation, and survival. some

src kinases are expressed ubiquitously, while other src
family members display different tissue-specific expression
patterns.  xxxg1028xxx  expression is restricted to myeloid cells and
b-lymphocytes, whereas lyn is expressed in myeloid cells,
b-lymphocytes, and natural killer cells. multiple domains
of bcr-abl interact with  xxxg1028xxx  and lyn, leading to their
activation.67,68 experiments with src dominant-negative
mutants suggest that src kinases play an important role in
the proliferation of bcr-abl–expressing cell lines.69 overexpression of src kinases is implicated in bcr-abl-mediated
leukemogenesis and in some cases of im resistance.70,71
overexpression and/or activation of  xxxg1028xxx  and lyn occur
during cml progression, suggesting that some acquired im
resistance may be bcr-abl-independent and mediated by
the overexpression of src.46 abl shows significant sequence
homology with the active configuration of src and has a
remarkable structural resemblance to src family kinases.
therefore, atp-competitive compounds, even if originally
developed as src inhibitors, can potentially inhibit abl
kinase because of the striking resemblance between the
catalytically active states of these two protein kinases.72,73
based on the similarity between abl and src, smallmolecule inhibitors with overlapping activity against both
abl and src may result in enhanced activity against cml
compared with im. when bcr-abl interacts with and activates  xxxg1028xxx , it phosphorylates and activates  xxxg2216xxx , leading
to myeloid cell transformation in vitro, suggesting that the
bcr-abl- xxxg1028xxx - xxxg2216xxx  pathway may have a pivotal role in
ph+ leukemias.73
bcr-abl–mediated transformation is cell-type–specific,
and different roles may be played by src family kinases
within different hematopoietic cell lineages. bcr-abl retrovirus transduced bone marrow cells from mice lacking the
expression of lyn,  xxxg1028xxx , and fgr induced cml, but not ph+
all.74 this suggested that lyn,  xxxg1028xxx , and fgr may play a
role in lymphoid leukemogenesis and that bcr-abl uses
different signaling pathways to induce cml and ph+ all.
for example, lymphoid blasts from patients with bp cml

332

that were exposed to small interfering rna (sirna) to
lyn in vitro specifically diminished lyn kinase expression
and then induced cell apoptosis. this suggests that lyn
kinase activity contributed to the lymphoid bp. however,
cells from patients with myeloid bp were less responsive to
lyn sirna.75

 xxxd1815xxx  ( xxxd1815xxx )
 xxxd1815xxx  (pyridol[2,3-d]pyrimidine,  xxxd1815xxx ;  xxxd1815xxx ;
fig. 1b) is a second-generation tk inhibitor for imresistant or -intolerant ph+ leukemias that was developed
by bristol–myers squibb (princeton, nj, usa) and was
approved by the fda in june 2006.76 in in vitro assays,
 xxxd1815xxx  at low nanomolar concentrations successfully
inhibited the kinase activity of 14 out of 15 different clinically relevant, im-resistant bcr-abl isoforms.77,78 the ic50
of  xxxd1815xxx  for bcr-abl is less than 1 nmol/l, compared
with 25 nmol/l for  xxxd2724xxx , which is described later.79
 xxxd1815xxx  also inhibits certain src family kinases (fyn, yes,
src, and  xxxg1212xxx ), with ic50 values in the range of 0.5 nmol/l.
furthermore,  xxxd1815xxx  has significant activity against c-kit
and pdgfr, with an ic50 for the inhibition of the kinase
activity at values of 5 and 28 nm, respectively.80,81
 xxxd1815xxx  binds to the atp-binding site in a position
that is similar to im. the central cores of  xxxd1815xxx  and
im share overlapping regions, the difference being that
they extend in opposite directions.  xxxd1815xxx  differs from
im and  xxxd2724xxx  in that it binds to both the active and
inactive conformation of abl kinase and inhibits a broader
range of kinase targets. data from cell-line studies have
demonstrated that  xxxd1815xxx  is more potent than either im
or  xxxd2724xxx . however, like  xxxd2724xxx  and im,  xxxd1815xxx  is
not active against those cells expressing the t315i mutation. crystallographic studies of the abl/ xxxd1815xxx  complex
showed that all the hydrogen bonds observed between abl
kinase and  xxxd1815xxx  were also observed in the src kinase
model.82 in addition, abl conformational requirements are
less stringent for  xxxd1815xxx  than for im.  xxxd1815xxx  is not
involved in critical interactions with many of the residues
subject to mutation, rendering  xxxd1815xxx  much more active
against a number of the abl kinase domain mutations seen
in patients resistant to im.83 however, novel, inhibitorspecific mutants of bcr-abl have eventually emerged.84

threonine 315 and phenylalanine 317 are crucial contact
residues for both im and  xxxd1815xxx . indeed, the t315i and
f317l amino acid substitutions are frequently reported in
patients who are resistant to im, and the t315a and the
f317i variants have been reported in patients resistant to
 xxxd1815xxx .85 however, neither the t315a nor the f317i
variants have ever been implicated in im resistance.
a phase 1 dose escalation study of  xxxd1815xxx  has shown
efficacy in patients intolerant or resistant to im. cytogenetic responses were obtained in 36%–62% of patients,
depending on the clinical phase of the disease, with the
effects gained more frequently in patients treated in cp.76
phase ii trials of  xxxd1815xxx  in patients with cml or ph+
all have been completed, and have led to the approval
of  xxxd1815xxx  for patients resistant to or intolerant of im.
the results of these studies are summarized in table 2.86
in cp cml, 387 patients resistant (75%) or intolerant
(25%) to im were treated. a chr was observed in 90%
of the patients, and mcgr was observed in 78% of imintolerant and in 42% of im-resistant patients. bcr-abl
mutations were detected in 160 of 363 (44%) patients, with
g250e (n = 23) and t315i (n = 3) being the most and
least frequently found mutations, respectively. significant
molecular responses were observed with a median bcrabl/abl ratio of 0.3% at 9 months. the 10-month progression-free survival was 88%. in ap cml, 174 patients were
treated with  xxxd1815xxx . chr was reported in 59 (34%) and
a ccgr was reported in 44 (25%) of the patients. the
most common nonhematological toxicities in the phase ii
studies were as follows: diarrhea (30%–60%), headache
(30%), rash (22%–27%), superficial edema (20%), and
pleural effusion (15%–25%). these were severe in fewer
than 5% of the study patients. grade 3 to 4 neutropenia
or thrombocytopenia was reported in 47% of the
patients.87–91
patients refractory to both im and  xxxd2724xxx  revealed
significant responses with  xxxd1815xxx .92 different bcr-abl
mutation profiles between im,  xxxd1815xxx , and  xxxd2724xxx  may
suggest benefits from the combination of im with either
 xxxd1815xxx  or  xxxd2724xxx .93 indeed, synergism of im and  xxxd2724xxx  has been demonstrated in a variety of cell lines and
in a murine model of cml, and  xxxd2724xxx  combined with
im has an additive or synergistic inhibitory effect on the
growth of bcr-abl-expressing cells. however, the t315i
mutation remained resistant.94

ap23464
ap23464 (ariad pharmaceuticals, cambridge, ma,
usa) is also a potent inhibitor of the src family kinases and
abl kinase, with an ic50 in the nanomolar range.95 ap23464
has antiproliferative activity against cml cell lines expressing wild-type bcr-abl. in addition, ap23464 inhibited the
proliferation of cells harboring various im-resistant bcrabl mutants (nucleotide-binding p-loop mutants, q252h,
y253f, e255k; a c-terminal loop mutant, m351i; and
an activation loop mutant, h396p), but similarly to the
previous compounds, ap23464 was unable to inhibit cells
expressing the t315i mutation.96 the testing of this compound is still at the preclinical stage.

 xxxd359xxx  ( xxxd359xxx )
 xxxd359xxx  ( xxxd359xxx : 4-anilino-3-quinolinecarbonitrile,
wyeth pharmaceuticals, madison, nj, usa; fig. 1c) is a
potent inhibitor of the src family kinases and abl tk activity.  xxxd359xxx  inhibits the phosphorylation of cellular proteins, including  xxxg2216xxx , at concentrations that inhibit the
proliferation of cml cells.  xxxd359xxx  treatment also reduced
the phosphorylation of the autoactivation site of the src
family kinases lyn and/or  xxxg1028xxx , and showed antiproliferative effects in three different bcr-abl–positive cml cell
lines in vitro. in addition, a once-daily oral administration
of this compound at 100 mg/kg for 5 days caused complete
regression of large k562 xenografts in a nude mouse model.97
clinical studies evaluating  xxxd359xxx  in patients with cml/
ph+all (phase i-ii) and solid tumors (phase i) are ongoing
to evaluate its safety and tolerability.98–100 unlike both im
and  xxxd1815xxx ,  xxxd359xxx  is more specific because it does not
significantly inhibit pdgfr or c-kit activity; it may be a
promising molecule in the clinical setting.

phosphorylation site tyr177. it has been suggested that the
enhanced potency of  xxxd2724xxx  compared to im is due to its
higher affinity for the abl kinase pocket.102 analysis of the
crystal structure of abl/ xxxd2724xxx  complexes reveals that
 xxxd2724xxx  binds to the inactive conformation of abl, like im,
but with subtle alterations in its structure that allow a better
topographical fit. preclinical data have confirmed its in vitro
efficacy in both im-sensitive and im-resistant cell lines,
with complementary in vivo data from a murine cml
model.103  xxxd2724xxx  prolonged survival in mice injected with
leukemic cells expressing wild-type and im-resistant
mutants of bcr-abl.104 although  xxxd2724xxx  is effective in the
majority of bcr-abl mutations, it also has no significant
effect on the t315i and g250e bcr-abl mutants. this may
be related to the proximity of the t315i residue to the site
of  xxxd2724xxx  binding.
a phase i trial has confirmed a role for  xxxd2724xxx  in
patients with im-resistant cml.105  xxxd2724xxx  doses ranged
from 50 mg once daily to 600 mg twice daily. grade 3/4
thrombocytopenia and grade 3/4 neutropenia were observed
in 20% and 13% of the treated patients, respectively. nonhematological grade 3/4 adverse events included elevated
bilirubin in 7% and elevated serum lipase in 5% of patients.
cytogenetic response varied with the disease phase: the
highest response was observed in cp patients (53%) compared with responses in ap (48%) or bp patients (27%).
the drug was well tolerated, with grade 3/4 thrombocytopenia being the most prevalent side effect seen with the
400-mg twice-daily dose regime, which was adopted for use
in the phase ii trials. a phase ii study was done of of  xxxd2724xxx  administered to im-resistant and -intolerant cml
patients in cp and those in bp or relapsed/refractory ph+
all. in cp, 81 patients were evaluable: chr was achieved
in 69% of patients and a cytogenetic response rate was
achieved in 68% of patients, of whom 46% had a major
response and 32% had a complete response. severe neutropenia and thrombocytopenia were noted in 16% and 19%
of the patients, respectively. similarly, a pilot study of  xxxd2724xxx  in patients newly diagnosed with cml showed higher
rates of ccgr compared with im therapy.106

 xxxd2724xxx  (amn107)
 xxxd2724xxx  (amn107,  xxxd2724xxx ; fig. 1d)) is an orally administered drug, developed by novartis to be highly selective
and potent against abl kinase. it is structurally related to
im, but is 20- to 50-fold more potent than im against bcrabl. in proliferation assays, 32 of 33 im-resistant mutant
cell lines, except for cells expressing the t315i mutation,
were inhibited by  xxxd2724xxx .  xxxd2724xxx  effectively inhibits the
autophosphorylation of bcr-abl on tyr177, an important
binding site for the grb2 adapter protein. tyr177 is involved
in bcr-abl pathogenesis through the regulation of diverse
signaling pathways, including the activation of phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (pi3k) and ras/erk. phosphorylated
tyr177 and its associated proteins were also identified as
key lineage determinants and regulators of the severity
of bcr-abl transformation.101 treatment of bcr-ablexpressing k562 cells with 10-nm doses of  xxxd2724xxx  resulted
in downregulated phosphorylation of the bcr-abl auto-

inno-406 (ns-187)
we thoroughly investigated the published crystal structure
of the kinase domain of c-abl with im bound, and found a
hydrophobic pocket formed by amino acid residues ile-293,
leu-298, leu-354, and val-379 around the phenyl ring of
im (fig. 4). then, we synthesized a considerable number of
compounds that introduced various hydrophobic substituents in this pocket and examined their biological effects one
by one. among these compounds, we identified a specific
dual abl-lyn inhibitor, ns-187 (fig. 1e), which is 25–55
times more potent than im in vitro. ns-187 is also at least
ten times as effective as im in suppressing the growth of
bcr-abl-bearing tumors, and markedly extends the survival
of mice with such tumors.107,108
this dual-specificity abl and lyn kinase inhibitor, ns187, extends to 12 of 13 bcr-abl proteins with mutations in

another cp cml patient showing im resistance, a 55-fold
reduction in bcr-abl transcript levels was observed after 1
month of inno-406 therapy. inno-406 was well tolerated
in patients at a dose of 240 mg/day, with encouraging evidence of clinical activity in im-resistant and  xxxd2724xxx -intolerant patients. further dose escalation to identify a
recommended phase ii dose is feasible, due to the complete
absence of grade 3/4 events (table 3).
non-atp-competitive inhibitors
fig. 4. a docking model of abl in complex with inno-406 (ns-187).
a hydrophobic pocket is formed by amino acid residues ile293, leu298,
leu354, and val379 around the phenyl ring adjacent to the piperazinylmethyl group of im. hydrogen-bonding interactions are shown as
broken white lines. the figure was prepared using pymol, version 0.97
(delano scientific, south san francisco, ca, usa)

while several atp competitive inhibitors have been
developed, as described above, none are effective against
the bcr-abl t315i mutant. therefore, one promising
approach to inhibit such bcr-abl mutants involves the substrate recognition domain of the kinase rather than the
atp-binding site.

their kinase domain, but not to t315i.107 ns-187 also inhibits lyn without affecting the phosphorylation of src, blk,
or yes. ns-187 significantly prolonged the survival of mice
that received ba/f3 cells expressing bcr-abl/wild-type
or the bcr-abl mutants, m244v, g250e, q252h, y253f,
e255k, m351t, and h396p, but not t315i. the rank order
of the ic50 values for cell growth inhibition was clearly
inversely correlated with the mean survival of mice treated
with ns-187 as a percentage of that of vehicle-treated controls.109 moreover, ns-187 significantly prolonged the survival of mice in a dose-dependent manner in murine central
nervous system leukemia models.110 ns-187 specifically
targets the bcr-abl and lyn kinases and may result in a
good safety profile and a clinical benefit.
a multicenter phase i clinical study of ns-187 (under the
code name of inno-406) was initiated in the united states
in july 2006, and the results of preliminary data have already
been reported.111 in this phase i study, patients with imresistant or intolerant ph+ leukemias were eligible for treatment with inno-406. twenty-one patients (11 in cp, 4 in
ap, and 2 in bp cml; 4 in ph+ all,) were enrolled in the
study, and of these, patients 9 and 11 had been previously
treated with  xxxd2724xxx  and  xxxd1815xxx , respectively. doselimiting toxicity has not been encountered. early pharmacokinetic data suggest that inno-406 blood levels at the
240-mg daily dose level are in excess of the drug levels
found to be potent against bcr-abl cell lines in vitro. one
cp cml patient treated with im for 69 months before
developing resistant disease with a y253h mutation, had a
cytogenetic response (minimal; 75% ph+) after 1 month of
inno-406 therapy, even at a dose of 30–60 mg/day. in

gumireddy et al.112 chose to target regions outside the atpbinding site of this enzyme, because non-atp-competitive
inhibitors offer the potential to be unaffected by mutations
that make cml cells resistant to im. one such agent is the
abl inhibitor on012380, which was specifically designed by
onconova therapeutics (princeton, nj, usa) to block the
substrate-binding site rather than the atp-binding site.
on012380 showed a tenfold stronger inhibition of wildtype bcr-abl compared to im. this strategy has the advantage in that the previously described im-resistant mutants
are unlikely to be resistant to this inhibitor because it targets
a different binding site. indeed, in vitro studies confirmed
this assumption, and on012380 was able to inhibit the
growth of cells expressing the wild-type bcr-abl protein
and all the im-resistant kinase domain mutations, even the
problematic t315i mutation, at a concentration of less than
10 nm. in vivo, on012380 caused a regression of leukemias
in mice injected with cells expressing the im-resistant t315i
mutant. moreover, doses of 300 mg/kg of on012380 produced no signs of toxicity in mice, suggesting a sound safety
profile.
interestingly, on012380 also has an activity against the
pdgfr kinases and the src family member lyn, with ic50
values for the inhibition of proliferation of approximately
80 nm. on012380 also worked synergistically with im to
inhibit wild-type bcr-abl, which was not unexpected,
because these two drugs bind to different sites on the abl
kinase. this new compound shows encouraging results, particularly in its ability to inhibit the t315i mutant. clinical
trials, however, have not yet commenced.

mk-0457 (vx-680)
aurora kinases are a family of serine/threonine kinases that
play an important role in protein phosphorylation events
regulating the mitotic phase of the cell cycle.113 aurora
kinases are overexpressed in several human cancers. this
prompted the investigation of inhibitors of these kinases
as therapeutic agents in cancer. one such aurora kinase
inhibitor, mk-0457 (formerly vx-680; merck research
laboratories, west point, pa, usa; see fig. 1f for chemical
structure), inhibited the proliferation of cml cells derived
from a patient harboring a bcr-abl t315i mutant.114–116
cocrystal studies have shown that threonine 315 and phenylalanine 317 are not directly involved in mk-0457 binding,
suggesting that mk-0457 is probably active against both
t315a-bcr-abl and f317i-bcr-abl mutants. clinical trials
with mk-0457 are ongoing.117
 xxxd1929xxx  and sgx-70430
the p38 inhibitor  xxxd1929xxx  has been reported to inhibit
the im- and  xxxd1815xxx -resistant abl/t315i kinase. yet
 xxxd1929xxx  at all tested concentrations was ineffective
against cells expressing the nonmutated bcr-abl protein or
the mutants y253f, e255k, and m351t.118 however,
o’hare and druker119 reported that  xxxd1929xxx  failed to
inhibit the proliferation of cells expressing bcr-abl/t315i,
arguing against the effects of this compound.
sgx pharmaceutical (san diego, ca, usa) has applied
a proprietary x-ray crystallographic fragment-based lead
discovery platform (fast) and structure-guided lead optimization strategy to identify potent inhibitors of wild-type
bcr-abl and the four most common mutants, including
t315i. their lead discovery efforts have yielded five chemical series that inhibit both wild-type and bcr-abl/t315i.
sgx-70430 potently inhibits the proliferation of k562 cells
and ba/f3 cells with wild-type bcr-abl and the four major
clinically relevant bcr-abl mutations. the ic50 values of this
compound against t315i, e255k, m351t, and y253f are 21,
77, 15 and 334 nm, respectively.120
the efficacy and safety of these two compounds for ph+
leukemias is to be evaluated in preclinical and clinical
trials.

“quiescent” cml stem cells
the development of better therapeutic strategies will
depend on a full understanding of the pathophysiology of
and the signaling pathways in cml. in addition, to overcome im resistance, the nature of cml stem cells should
be elucidated, because these cells are proving to be exceptionally refractory to the attempts to kill them by im or
conventional chemotherapeutic agents, such as cytosine
arabinoside. recent studies have identified primitive, malignant stem cells that are “quiescent” and present in all cml
patients, even if in small numbers. the insensitivity or resistance to drug treatment has important implications for the

clinical management of cml, particularly with regard to a
relapse following an im-induced remission.121
normal hematopoietic stem cells (hscs) have the
characteristic stem-cell functions of self-replication, and the
production of differentiated progeny, which is observed as
maturing blood cells of all lineages. these functions are
regulated by soluble cytokines and interactions between
cells and stroma. the majority of normal hscs are a quiescent cell population stabilized in the g0 stage of the cell
cycle, with each cell cycling every 1–3 months.122,123 it has
been shown that cml develops as a consequence of characteristic changes within the hscs. almost all neoplastic
clones carry the cytogenetic abnormality, ph, and the fusion
oncogene, bcr-abl. there is evidence for deregulated turnover in the ph+ hsc population, with the majority of cells
cycling at any given time. despite this, it is estimated that
approximately 0.5% of ph+ hscs remain “quiescent”. this
quiescent subpopulation is capable of inducing a cml-like
disease in mice, indicating that, in vivo, the quiescent state
is both temporary and reversible.124
hematopoietic neoplasms have a distinct hierarchy, with
a small compartment of malignant stem cells maintaining
the tumor. an important parameter is the relative proportion of self-replicative versus differentiative divisions in the
population (fig. 5). if self-replicative (i.e., stem-cellproducing) divisions exceed the number of differentiative
divisions, the population will expand progressively in a
gompertzian manner, regardless of the presence of differentiating and/or dying cells within the population. successful therapeutic agents must enhance the death rate of this
rare population of cml stem cells to reduce the progression of this disease.125 therefore, the malignant stem cell is
the ultimate therapeutic target.
there is a body of evidence, however, that cml stem
cells may be less sensitive to im than the bulk of cml
cells.126–128 im kills the more mature leukemic cells, and a
similar finding may apply to other bcr-abl-targeted agents,
such as  xxxd1815xxx  and  xxxd2724xxx .129,130 therefore, doubts
remain about the ability to eradicate the quiescent cml
stem-cell population with im or even with both  xxxd1815xxx 
and  xxxd2724xxx .
concerning these aspects of cml stem cells and drug
resistance, two intriguing reports have recently been published. michor et al.131 insist that a four-compartment model
can explain the kinetics of the molecular response to im.
this model suggests that im is a potent inhibitor of the
production of differentiated leukemic cells, but does not
deplete cml stem cells. in other words, im dramatically
reduces the rate at which these cells are being produced
from cml stem cells, but it does not lead to an observable
decline of leukemic stem cells. the probability of harboring
resistance mutations increases with disease progression as
a consequence of an increased leukemic stem-cell abundance. the characteristic time-to-treatment failure caused
by acquired resistance is given by the growth rate of the
leukemic stem cells. michor et al.131 suggest that multiple
drug therapy is especially important for patients who are
diagnosed with advanced and rapidly growing disease.
similarily, komarova and wodarz132 suggest that, within the

the difference in stem-cell selfrenewal in proliferative normal
blood cells of stable population
size and in a progressively
expanding leukemia. in a stable
normal population, 50% of the
progeny of clonogenic cells lose
their self-generative capacity and
yield differentiating progeny. in
leukemia, more than 50% of the
progeny of dividing clonogenic
cells remain clonogenic. regardless of whether or not differentiating progeny are produced, such
a population will progressively
expand in size. regression of
a tumor can be induced by

assumptions of the mathematical model, a combination of
at least three targeted drugs with different specificities may
overcome the problem of resistance. based on these theoretical assumptions, combination therapies are warranted.
indeed, there may be benefits to be gained by combining
im with either  xxxd1815xxx  or  xxxd2724xxx . however, the t315i
mutation will remain resistant.133,134 also, new mutations are
likely to emerge after the novel targeted drugs are administered for a certain time period, which may place limits on
this type of treatment.

future prospects and conclusion
the current first-line therapy for newly diagnosed patients
with cml is definitely im. however, problems remain,
such as the development of im resistance and the persistence of quiescent cml stem cells, as mentioned above.
novel inhibitors including  xxxd1815xxx ,  xxxd2724xxx ,  xxxd359xxx , and
inno-406 may work to some extent for im-resistant
patients. alternatively, the focus of novel therapeutic
strategies may shift to drugs or treatments with completely
different mechanisms of action. drugs or treatments could
be designed to: (1) better target the cellular mechanism/
molecule involved in cml, with reduced adverse effects;
(2) provide immune therapy for cml (not discussed in this
review); and (3) eradicate cml stem cells by destroying
their niche in the bone-marrow microenvironment. the
development of a promising form of immune therapy will
depend on the identification of unique antigenic sites within
cml cells, and exploiting these would enable the eradication of the quiescent cml stem cells by the immune system.

niche have been rapidly acquired; therefore, it will not be
long until the nature of the leukemic stem cells is uncovered. novel therapeutic methods should be forthcoming
once the leukemic stem-cell niche has been identified. the
three strategies mentioned above are likely to be implemented in the order shown above. collectively, they would
establish multifaceted therapy for cml in the future. it is
widely accepted that remarkable therapeutic gains have
been obtained with im. for this reason, it is likely to remain
the standard first-line therapy for the majority of patients
for the foreseeable future; that is, until novel agents superior to im are developed. the development of a series of
new effective and safe agents is ongoing. at the same time,
most importantly, all efforts from now on should be made
to develop novel strategies aimed to eradicate cml stem
cells and to establish effective immune therapies.
