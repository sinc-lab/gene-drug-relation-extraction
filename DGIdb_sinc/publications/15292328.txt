sequential conversion of estradiol to catecholestradiols and
methoxyestradiols by cytochrome-p450 (cyp450) and  xxxg487xxx  (comt), respectively, contributes
to the antimitogenic effects of estradiol on vascular smooth
muscle cell (smc) growth via  xxxg730xxx -independent
mechanisms. because catecholamines are also substrates for
comt, we hypothesize that catecholamines may abrogate the
vasoprotective effects of estradiol by competing for comt
and inhibiting  xxxd3206xxx  formation. to test this hypothesis, we investigated the antimitogenic/inhibitory effects
of estradiol on human coronary artery smc growth (cell number, dna synthesis, collagen synthesis, and smc migration)
and  xxxg1369xxx /2 phosphorylation in the presence and absence of
catecholamines. norepinephrine, epinephrine,  xxxd2401xxx ,
and or486 (comt inhibitor) abrogated the inhibitory effects
of estradiol on smc growth and  xxxg1369xxx /2 phosphorylation. the

interaction of catecholamines with estradiol was not affected
by  xxxd2914xxx  or propanolol, ␣- and ␤-adrenoceptor antagonists, respectively. the antimitogenic effects of 2-hydroxyestradiol, but not  xxxd28xxx , were abrogated by
epinephrine,  xxxd2401xxx , and or486. catecholamines inhibited the conversion of both estradiol and 2-hydroxyestradiol to  xxxd28xxx , and smcs expressed  xxxg575xxx 
and  xxxg577xxx . our findings suggest that catecholamines within
the coronary arteries may abrogate the antivasoocclusive effects of estradiol by blocking the conversion of catecholestradiols to methoxyestradiols. the interaction between catecholamines and estradiol metabolism may importantly
define the cardiovascular effects of estradiol therapy in postmenopausal women. (j clin endocrinol metab 89: 3922–3931,
2004)

e

tion in lesions of mice lacking er␣ (6), er␤ (7), or both er␣
and er␤ (double knockout) (8) suggest that the antimitogenic effects of estradiol on smc growth may be er independent and involve yet another mechanism.
support for the participation of an er-independent mechanism in mediating the antimitogenic effects of estradiol also
comes from the observations that exogenous estradiol inhibits injury-induced neointima formation in gonadectomized, but not intact, male rats, even though vascular cells
from both models express ers (9). pharmacological evidence
for a role of ers in mediating the antimitogenic effects of
estradiol in smcs is controversial. ici182780, an er antagonist, was effective in blocking the injury-induced neointima
formation in one study (10), but not another (11). due to
similarity in its structure with estradiol, ici182780 not only
binds to the er, but also blocks the metabolism of estradiol
to 2-hydroxyestradiol (a potent inhibitor of smc growth) by
competing for cytochrome p450 (cyp450) enzymes (12). in
in vitro studies with smcs, we have demonstrated that
ici182780 blocks the antimitogenic effects of estradiol only
at concentrations that inhibit the metabolism of estradiol to
hydroxyestradiol (12, 13). taken together, the above findings
provide strong evidence that the antiproliferative actions of
estradiol may be er independent; however, the exact mechanism involved remains undiscovered.
endogenous estradiol is sequentially metabolized to cat-

vidence from multiple epidemiological and observational studies suggest that estradiol protects the
cardiovascular system and is responsible for the lower incidence of coronary artery disease observed in premenopausal
women compared with age-matched men (1). however,
findings of randomized hormone replacement therapy trials
for the primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular
disease do not support this idea (2, 3). the reasons for the
negative findings remain unclear and emphasize the need for
a greater understanding of the mechanisms by which estradiol influences the vasculature.
although estradiol is known to positively influence the
vasculature via multiple mechanisms (4), its inhibitory effects on smooth muscle cell (smc) growth play a key role in
protecting blood vessels against vasoocclusive disorders.
based on the conventional mechanisms of steroid action, the
growth inhibitory effects of estradiol are thought to be mediated via  xxxg730xxx  (er)␣ and/or er␤ expressed by
smcs (5). however, recent findings that administration of

dubey et al. • catecholamines block antimitogenesis by estradiol

echolestradiols (e.g. 2-hydroxyestradiol) by cyp450, and catecholestradiols are metabolized to methoxyestradiols (e.g.
2-methoxyestrdaiol) by  xxxg487xxx  (comt).
catecholestradiols and methoxyestradiols have, respectively,
little or no binding affinity for ers, yet are potent inhibitors of
cancer cell growth (14, 15). because the antigrowth effects of
estradiol are in part er independent, we hypothesized that
methoxyestradiols mediate the antiproliferative actions of estradiol on smc growth. subsequently, using pharmacological
agents to block or induce the conversion of estradiol to catecholestradiols and methoxyestradiols and using comt
knockout mice, we provided strong evidence that methoxyestradiols mediate the antimitogenic effects of estradiol in
smcs (12, 13, 16). moreover, we found similar effects in cardiac
fibroblasts (17) and glomerular mesangial cells (18), cell types
that are relevant for the cardiovascular system.
apart from metabolizing estradiol to methoxyestradiols,
comt is a key enzyme responsible for catabolizing catecholamines (19). therefore, it is conceivable that increased
levels of catecholamines may abrogate the vasoprotective
effects of estradiol by competing for comt and inhibiting
the conversion of catecholestradiols to methoxyestradiols.
this hypothesis is supported by the observations: 1) that
postmenopausal compared with premenopausal women exhibit greater stress-induced increases in catecholamine levels
and sympathetic activity (20, 21); 2) that, in general, patients
with cardiovascular disease (atherosclerosis and hypertension) have higher levels of catecholamines (22–25); 3) that
increased sympathetic activity accelerates the process of vasoocclusive disorders in animal models (26, 27); and 4) that
increased synthesis of catecholamines under pathological conditions induces vasoocclusive disorders (28, 29).
as outlined in fig. 1, the goals of the present study were
to test the hypothesis that catecholamines can reduce the
antigrowth effects of estradiol on smcs via a mechanism that
involves the competitive inhibition of  xxxd3206xxx  formation by comt. to test this hypothesis, we determined
whether catecholamines abrogate the antimitogenic effects
of estradiol and whether the abrogatory effects of catecholamines were due to inhibitory effects on the metabolism
of estradiol to methoxyestradiols or to direct growth stimulatory effects of catecholamines via ␣- or ␤-adrenoceptors.

␣-actin monoclonal antibodies and by morphological criteria specific for
smc as described in detail previously (5). smcs in the fourth passage
were used for all studies.

growth studies
[3h]thymidine incorporation (index of dna synthesis) and cell number (cell proliferation) studies were conducted to investigate the effects
of various test agents on cell growth. smcs were plated at a density of
5 ⫻ 103 cells/well in 24-well tissue culture dishes and allowed to grow
to subconfluence in dmem/ham’s f-12 (phenol red-free) medium containing 10% fcs (steroid free and delipidated) under standard tissue
culture conditions. the cells were then growth arrested by feeding them
dmem (phenol red free) containing 0.4% albumin for 48 h. for dna
synthesis, growth was initiated by treating growth-arrested cells for 20 h
with dmem containing 2.5% fcs and containing or lacking the test
agent(s). to evaluate the roles of ers and adrenergic receptors (␣ and
␤), cells were pretreated for 30 min with ici182780,  xxxd2914xxx , or
propranolol before treatment with the test agents. after 20 h of incubation, the treatments were repeated with freshly prepared solutions,
but supplemented with [3h]thymidine (1 ␮ci/ml) for an additional 4 h.
the experiments were terminated by washing the cells twice with dulbecco’s pbs and twice with ice-cold trichloroacetic acid (10%). the
precipitate was solubilized in 500 ␮l 0.3 n naoh and 0.1% sodium
 xxxd3215xxx  after incubation at 50 c for 2 h. aliquots from four wells
for each treatment with 10 ml scintillation fluid were counted in a liquid
scintillation counter. for cell number experiments smcs were allowed
to attach overnight, were growth-arrested for 48 h, and then were treated
every 24 h for 4 d; on d 5, cells were dislodged and counted on a coulter
counter (beckman coulter, fullerton, ca).
[3h]proline incorporation studies were performed to investigate the
effects of various test agents on collagen synthesis. confluent monolayers of smcs were made quiescent by feeding dmem containing 0.4%
albumin for 48 h. smcs growth arrested for 48 h were treated with
dmem supplemented with 2.5% fcs plus l-[3h]proline (1 ␮ci/ml) and
containing or lacking the test agents. to evaluate the roles of ers and
adrenergic receptors (␣ and ␤), cells were pretreated for 30 min with

ici182780,  xxxd2914xxx , or propranolol before treatment with the test
agents. the experiments were terminated by washing the cells twice
with pbs and twice with ice-cold trichloroacetic acid (10%). the precipitate was solubilized as described above, and aliquots from four wells
for each treatment were counted in a liquid scintillation counter. each
experiment was conducted in triplicate and with three separate cultures
of smcs. to make sure that the inhibitory effects of the experimental
agents on collagen synthesis were not due to changes in cell number, the
experiments were conducted in confluent monolayers of cells in which
changes in cell number were precluded. additionally, cell counting was
performed in cells treated in parallel with the cells used for the collagen
synthesis studies, and data were normalized to cell number.

smc migration
modified boyden’s chambers (neuroprobe, inc., cabin john, md)
were used to evaluate the effects of various treatments on plateletderived growth factor-bb ( xxxd292xxx )-induced smc migration, as previously described (5).

 xxxg1369xxx /2 phosphorylation
the effects of the test agents on  xxxg1369xxx /2 phosphorylation were also
assessed because  xxxg1369xxx /2 is an important mediator of cell growth. smcs
grown to subconfluence in 35-mm2 culture dishes were treated for 24 h
with or without various test agents in the presence of fcs (2.5%). after
the treatments, the cells were washed with ice-cold pbs and solubilized
by adding lysis buffer. equal amounts of proteins (20 ␮g/lane) were
denatured by boiling at 95 c for 5 min and resolved in 10% sodium
 xxxd3215xxx -polyacrylamide gel. after separation, the proteins were
transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane, the membranes were probed
with  xxxg1369xxx /2 antibodies, and the bands were visualized after staining
with peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody and the enhance chemiluminescence system and using x-omat ls films (eastman kodak co.,
rochester, ny) for exposure.

when evaluating a treatment-dependent effect and /or concentrationdependent effect within a group, data were analyzed by one-factor
anova, followed by fisher’s least significant difference test for multiple comparisons. two-way anova followed by bonferroni’s t test or
dunnett’s multiple comparison test were employed to compare differences between groups. all treatment-related effects within a group at a

treatment with 2.5% fcs stimulated [3h]thymidine incorporation (dna synthesis) and [3h]proline incorporation
(collagen synthesis) by approximately 8- and 7-fold (p ⬍

nmol/liter estradiol concentration-dependently inhibited
fcs-induced [3h]thymidine incorporation (fig. 2), [3h]proline incorporation (fig. 3), and cell number (cell proliferation;
fig. 3). treatment with 100 nmol/liter estradiol inhibited
fcs-induced [3h]thymidine incorporation (fig. 2), cell number (fig. 3a), and [3h]proline incorporation (fig. 3b) by
approximately 40 –50%. epinephrine, norepinephrine, and

metabolism studies
to assess the effects of catecholamines on the conversion of 2-hydroxyestradiol to  xxxd28xxx , confluent smcs were incubated
with 2-hydroxyestradiol for 1 h in the presence or absence of catecholamines ( xxxd2401xxx , epinephrine, or norepinephrine). next, internal standard (16␣-hydroxyestradiol) was added, samples were extracted with methylene chloride, extracts were dried under vacuum,
residues were reconstituted in the mobile phase, and samples were
analyzed by hplc with ultraviolet detection using gradient elution, as
previously described (13). due to decreased assay sensitivity, the metabolism of estradiol to  xxxd28xxx  by smcs was assessed in the
presence of microsomes to facilitate the formation 2-hydroxyestradiol
(substrate for  xxxd28xxx ) from estradiol. briefly, human microsomes (1 mg/ml) were incubated for 2 h with 75 ␮mol/liter estradiol,
and the supernatants containing the metabolites were collected. subsequently, confluent monolayers of smcs were treated for 1 h in the
presence or absence of catecholamines ( xxxd2401xxx , epinephrine, or
norepinephrine) with supernatants collected from human microsomes
incubated with estradiol (as described above). after the treatment, the
samples were extracted, and  xxxd28xxx  levels were analyzed
by hplc (13).

 xxxg575xxx  and  xxxg577xxx  expression studies
to investigate whether the smcs express  xxxg575xxx  and  xxxg577xxx , cell
lysates from smcs treated for 36 h with the cyp450 inducer 3-methylcholantherene (10 ␮mol/liter) were analyzed by western blots and
probed with antibodies against  xxxg575xxx  (rabbit antihuman polyclonal
antibodies; chemicon international, inc., temecula, ca) and  xxxg577xxx

treatment with or486 alone had no effect on basal or seruminduced smc proliferation.
similar to the effects on fcs-induced [3h]thymidine incorporation, the catecholamines abrogated the inhibitory effects of estradiol on collagen synthesis ([3h]proline incorporation; fig. 3b). at a concentration of 10 ␮mol/liter,

treatment of smcs with  xxxd292xxx  induced smc migration, and this effect was concentration-dependently inhibited
by estradiol (fig. 4a). the inhibitory effects of estradiol on
 xxxd292xxx -induced smc migration were significantly abrogated in the presence of 10 ␮mol/liter  xxxd2401xxx , epinephrine, norepinephrine, or or486 (fig. 4b). treatment of

proliferation, and collagen synthesis were blocked by  xxxd2914xxx , an ␣-adrenoceptor antagonist (fig. 5, a–c). similar
to epinephrine, norepinephrine induced mitogenesis in
smcs, and these effects were also blocked by  xxxd2914xxx 
(data not shown). these findings suggest that ␣-adrenoceptors mediate the mitogenic effects of epinephrine and norepinephrine. in contrast to epinephrine and norepinephrine,
treatment of smcs with  xxxd2401xxx  did not induce mitogenesis; moreover, the effects were not altered by propranolol, a ␤-adrenoceptor antagonist (fig. 5, d–f). together the
above findings suggest that the mitogenic effects of catecholamines are mediated via ␣-adrenoceptors, but not
␤-adrenoceptors.
to investigate whether the abrogatory effects of catecholamines were mediated via adrenoceptors, we investigated their ability to block the antimitogenic effects
of estradiol in the presence or absence of the ␣- and
␤-adrenoceptor antagonists,  xxxd2914xxx  and propranolol,
respectively. as shown in fig. 5, a–c, 1 ␮mol/liter epinephrine blocked the inhibitory effects of 100 nmol/liter estradiol
on fcs-induced [3h]thymidine incorporation (fig. 5a), cell
proliferation (fig. 5b), and [3h]proline incorporation (fig.
5c), and the abrogatory effects of epinephrine were not diminished by 3 ␮mol/liter  xxxd2914xxx . similarly, the abrogatory effects of  xxxd2401xxx  on estradiol-mediated inhibition of fcs-induced [3h]thymidine incorporation,
[3h]proline incorporation, and cell proliferation were not
prevented by propranolol (fig. 5, d–f).
to determine whether catecholamines block the antimitogenic effects of estradiol by preventing the conversion of
catecholestradiols to methoxyestradiols, we investigated the
growth inhibitory effects of 2-hydroxyestradiol and  xxxd26xxx -

dubey et al. • catecholamines block antimitogenesis by estradiol

thoxyestradiol in the presence and absence of epinephrine
and  xxxd2401xxx . as shown in fig. 6, the inhibitory effects
of 2-hydroxyestradiol on fcs-induced [3h]thymidine incorporation (fig. 6a), cell proliferation (fig. 6b), and [3h]proline
incorporation (fig. 6c) were abrogated by epinephrine, norepinephrine, and  xxxd2401xxx  and also by the comt inhibitor, or486. moreover, the abrogatory effects of epinephrine and  xxxd2401xxx  were not reversed by  xxxd2914xxx  or
propranolol, suggesting that the effects were independent of
adrenoceptors. similar to 2-hydroxyestradiol,  xxxd28xxx  inhibited fcs-induced smc growth and [3h]proline incorporation (fig. 6c). however, in contrast to estradiol and
2-hydroxyestradiol, the inhibitory effects of  xxxd28xxx  were not blocked by catecholamines or or486 (fig. 6),
suggesting that catecholamines abrogate the effects of estradiol by blocking the conversion of catecholestradiols to
methoxyestradiols.
the inhibitory effect of estradiol on  xxxg1369xxx /2 is in part
responsible for mediating its growth inhibitory effects. treatment of smcs with 10 nmol/liter estradiol for 24 h inhibited

for converting estradiol to 2- and 4-hydroxyestradiols (4)

of the cyp450 isozymes,  xxxg575xxx  and  xxxg577xxx , in smcs (fig.

the protective effects of estradiol on the cardiovascular
system remain controversial. however, it is well established
that estradiol can influence both vascular biology and physiology by directly interacting with cells in the vessel wall (4).
mounting evidence suggests that in addition to the conventional er-dependent mechanism, estradiol can induce its
biological effects via nonclassical er-independent and nongenomic mechanisms (4). to understand the adverse as well
as the beneficial effects of estradiol on the cardiovascular
system, it is important to elucidate the various mechanisms
by which estradiol can influence vascular biology and
physiology.
abnormal growth of smcs plays a major role in the vascular remodeling process associated with vasoocclusive disorders, including atherosclerosis and coronary artery disease
(31). in the present study physiological and pharmacological
concentrations of estradiol inhibited smc growth, and these
effects were attenuated by catecholamines. the abrogatory
effects of catecholamines were not reduced by ␣- and ␤adrenoceptor blockers, and catecholamines blocked the inhibitory effects of 2-hydroxyestradiol, but not  xxxd28xxx ,
on smc growth. the abrogatory effects of catecholamines were
mimicked by the selective comt inhibitor, or486. smcs efficiently metabolized 2-hydroxyestradiol to  xxxd28xxx 
and expressed cyp450 enzymes responsible for converting estradiol to 2-hydroxyestardiol. moreover, both catecholamines
and or486 inhibited the conversion of estradiol and 2hydroxyestradiol to  xxxd28xxx  by smcs. taken together, our findings provide evidence that catecholamines
block the antimitogenic effects of estradiol in smcs by inhibiting  xxxd3206xxx  formation. our results imply that
the vasoprotective effects of estradiol in any individual may
depend in part on the local levels of catecholamines in the
vessel wall.
adrenergic receptors mediate the effects of catecholamines on cell growth (30); hence, it is possible that catecholamines abrogate the antimitogenic effects of estradiol
and 2-hydroxyestradiol by interacting with the adrenergic
receptors rather than by inhibiting comt. in this context, in
vascular smcs, catecholamines induce smc growth via ␣1-

adrenoceptors and inhibit smc growth via ␤2-adrenoceptors
(30). in the present study smc growth was induced by the
␣-adrenoceptor agonist, epinephrine, but not by the ␤-adrenoceptor agonist,  xxxd2401xxx . moreover, the mitogenic
effects of catecholamine were blocked by the ␣-adrenoceptor
antagonist,  xxxd2914xxx , but not by the ␤-adrenoceptor
antagonist, propranolol, suggesting that the mitogenic effects in smcs are mediated by ␣-adrenoceptors. our finding
that the abrogatory effects of catecholamines are not blocked
by  xxxd2914xxx  or propranolol provides strong evidence
that catecholamines abrogate the effects of estradiol by inhibiting comt and not by activating adrenergic receptors. a direct
effect of catecholamines on smc growth is also ruled out by the
observation that in presence of fcs, catecholamines only marginally affect smc proliferation in the absence of estradiol and
2-hydroxyestradiol. in this regard, the highest concentrations
(10 ␮mol/liter) of epinephrine and norepinephrine enhanced
fcs-induced smc proliferation by approximately 6 –7%, and
 xxxd2401xxx  inhibited proliferation by approximately 6%.
we have previously shown that the antimitogenic effects

of estradiol on smcs are blocked by cyp450 inhibitors and
enhanced by cyp450 inducers (13). because cyp450
isozymes are responsible for metabolizing estradiol to catecholestradiols, a precursor of methoxyestradiols, we postulated that the sequential conversion of estradiol to catecholestradiols and methoxyestradiols is responsible for
mediating the antigrowth effects of estradiol. our finding
that smcs expressed  xxxg575xxx  and  xxxg577xxx  and that catecholamines block the conversion of estradiol to  xxxd28xxx  provides strong evidence that in smcs estradiol can be locally converted to catecholestradiols and
methoxyestradiols. our contention that local conversion of
estradiol to methoxyestradiols is responsible for its erindependent antimitogenic effects on smcs is also supported
by our recent findings that the antimitogenic effects of estradiol are abrogated in smcs from comt knockout mice
(16). we have reached similar conclusions in glomerular
mesangial cells (18) and cardiac fibroblasts (17), cells relevant
to the cardiovascular system.

dubey et al. • catecholamines block antimitogenesis by estradiol

catecholamines that inhibited  xxxd28xxx  formation
by 16 –36% was able to completely reverse the inhibitory
effect of estradiol on smc growth. a potential explanation
for the difference in the inhibitory effects of catecholamines
on metabolism vs. growth might be the difference in experimental conditions (cell number, cell density, time of
treatment, and concentration of estradiol). in this context,
it is important to note that the inhibitory effects of catecholamines on the metabolism of estradiol and the antigrowth effects of estradiol are time dependent. importantly,
in the metabolism studies the cells were incubated for 1 h,
whereas in the growth studies the cells were treated for 24 h
or 4 d.
the observations of the present study suggest that catecholamines block the antimitogenic effects of estradiol by
blocking the formation of methoxyestradiols; however, additional studies are required to elucidate the exact contribution of 2- and 4- xxxd3206xxx  in mediating the antimitogenic effects of estradiol. it is well established that
 xxxd28xxx  is the major endogenous metabolite of
estradiol, whereas 4- xxxd3206xxx  is a minor metabolite
(32). moreover,  xxxg577xxx  metabolizes estradiol largely to
4-hydroxyestradiol and to a lesser extent to 2-hydroxyestradiol. in contrast,  xxxg575xxx  metabolizes estradiol largely to
2-hydroxyestradiol, whereas 4-hydroxyestradiol is a minor
product (4, 14). because smcs express both  xxxg575xxx  and
 xxxg577xxx , the continuous formation of both 2- and 4-hydroxyestradiols may play an important role in mediating the
antimitogenic effect of estradiol on smcs. this idea is further
supported by our finding that both  xxxd28xxx  and
4- xxxd3206xxx  inhibit fcs-induced smc growth.
in vivo metabolism of estradiol to 2-hydroxyestradiol accounts for 50% of the estradiol metabolites formed (4, 14),
and the levels of catecholestradiols range from 0.12– 0.3
␮mol/liter in peripheral blood. substantial amounts of
2-hydroxyestradiol are thus available to be converted to
 xxxd28xxx . due to the rapid conversion of 2-hydroxyestradiol to  xxxd28xxx , accurate data on the
levels of 2-hydroxyestradiol are not available. nonetheless,
the serum level of  xxxd28xxx  in pregnant women is
30 nmol/liter, and rough estimates suggest that  xxxd28xxx  levels may be several-fold higher than the
levels of estradiol (4, 14). smcs and vascular endothelial cells
are well endowed with comt, ensuring pharmacologically
active, steady state levels of methoxyestradiols within the
vessel wall.
under normal conditions, circulating levels of norepinephrine and epinephrine range from 1–2 nmol/liter (33);
however, after sympathetic nerve stimulation the circulating
levels of norepinephrine and epinephrine increase to as high
as 12 nmol/liter (34). moreover, concentrations of norepinephrine in average neuroeffector junctions are almost 4
times greater than circulating levels (35), i.e. approximately
50 nmol/liter. indeed, both the width of the junction and the
efficiency of uptake and metabolism of norepinephrine define the final levels of norepinephrine at a individual neuroeffector junction, which in some junctions can be higher
than 50 nmol/liter. in the present study, concentrations of
catecholamines as low as 100 nmol/liter significantly attenuated the growth inhibitory effect of 100 nmol/liter estradiol

j clin endocrinol metab, august 2004, 89(8):3922–3931 3929

and 2-hydroxyestradiol. as the interaction between catecholamines and estradiol-derived 2-hydroxyestradiol at the
level of comt is competitive, even lower levels of catecholamines would be expected to attenuate the antimitogenic effects of lower levels of estradiol/2-hydroxyestradiol.
moreover, the sequential conversion of estradiol to 2-hydroxyestradiol and  xxxd28xxx  locally within the
smcs would be more susceptible to inhibition by catecholamines due to the rate-limiting step of 2-hydroxyestradiol formation. in this context we have recently shown that
the conversion of 2-hydroxyestradiol to  xxxd28xxx 
in isolated organs is significantly inhibited after nerve stimulation (36). taken together, these considerations imply that
increased synthesis of catecholamines under pathological
conditions could effectively attenuate the inhibitory effects of
estradiol on smc growth.
increases in sympathetic activity, circulating catecholamine levels, and secretion of norepinephrine (26 –29) have
been observed in patients with cardiovascular disease, including essential hypertension, atherosclerosis, and coronary artery disease (37–39). also, stress-induced sympathetic
activity as well as circulating catecholamine levels and catecholamine spill-over are increased by approximately 2-fold
in peri- and postmenopausal women compared with premenopausal women (40 – 43). this implies that at the neuroeffector junctions the levels of norepinephrine in some
people are much higher than normal. the higher levels of
norepinephrine could potentially occupy comt to such an
extent as to inhibit or limit the metabolism of other catechols.
this could also inhibit or limit the conversion of catecholestrogens and consequently abrogate the vascular protective
action of estradiol.
increased sympathetic activity is positively associated
with intimal thickening (26, 28), suggesting that catecholamines can induce vascular remodeling processes associated with vasoocclusive disorders. in animal models in
which the sympathetic activity is pharmacologically inhibited (38, 44) or minimized by denervation (24, 26), the progression of cardiovascular disease (hypertension and atherosclerosis) is substantially reduced compared with that in
untreated animals. moreover, the growth-inducing effects of
catecholamines are blocked when adrenergic receptors are
blocked (30). this indirect evidence indicates the adverse
effects of catecholamines on the cardiovascular system. our
findings suggest that increased catecholamines may have an
adverse effect on the progression of vasoocclusive disorders
by competing for comt and thereby reducing the methylation of estradiol-derived 2-hydroxyestradiol. interestingly,
we have recently shown that compared with other arterial
beds, smcs from coronary arteries are approximately 2-fold
more efficient in converting catecholestradiols to methoxyestradiols (36), suggesting that efficient conversion of
estradiol to  xxxd3206xxx  may play a critical role in specifically protecting women against coronary artery disease.
thus, the antivasoocclusive actions of estradiol in postmenopausal women may be defined by the local levels of catecholamines, and increased catecholamine levels may be responsible for the lack of protective effects observed in some
studies.

diol inhibit the growth of cardiac fibroblasts (17). because
catecholamines are known to play a key role in the cardiac
remodeling process associated with ventricular hypertrophy
in myocardial infarction and heart failure (39), it is possible
that the interactions between catecholestradiols and catecholamines may participate in the pathophysiology of cardiac disorders.
comt is not only responsible for converting estradiol to
methoxyestradiols; it is also a key enzyme that catabolizes
catecholamines (19). via a competitive interaction for comt,
catecholamines can inhibit the conversion of estradiol to
 xxxd3206xxx  and abrogate the antimitogenic effects of
estradiol (45, 46). in contrast, because of competition for
comt, via generation of catecholestradiols, it is conceivable
that estradiol could elevate catecholamine levels. however,
because catecholestradiols directly inhibit  xxxg2276xxx  (47), a rate-limiting enzyme for catecholamine synthesis, it is unlikely that catecholestradiols would increase catecholamine levels. indeed, administration of estradiol to
postmenopausal women has been shown to lower circulating
catecholamine levels, catecholamine spill-over, and sympathetic activity (40 – 43).
in conclusion, our findings provide evidence that smcs
metabolize estradiol-derived catecholestradiols to methoxyestradiols, and comt-mediated conversion of catecholestradiols to methoxyestradiols is essential for the inhibitory effects of estradiol on smc growth. our findings
suggest that interactions between catecholamines and endogenous catecholestradiols may play an important role in
defining the overall protective effects of estradiol in the coronary artery. these findings imply that estradiol metabolism
may be an important determinant of the cardiovascular protective effects of estradiol. thus, interindividual differences,
either genetic or acquired, in estradiol metabolism may define a given female’s risk of cardiovascular disease and influence the cardiovascular benefit she receives from estradiol
replacement therapy in the postmenopausal state.
