bile acids are essential for the solubilization and transport of dietary lipids and
are the major products of cholesterol catabolism. results presented here show
that bile acids are physiological ligands for the  xxxg1597xxx  (fxr), an
orphan nuclear receptor. when bound to bile acids, fxr repressed transcription
of the gene encoding cholesterol 7a-hydroxylase, which is the rate-limiting
enzyme in bile acid synthesis, and activated the gene encoding intestinal bile
acid-binding protein, which is a candidate bile acid transporter. these results
demonstrate a mechanism by which bile acids transcriptionally regulate their
biosynthesis and enterohepatic transport.

the enzymatic conversion of cholesterol to
bile acids is regulated through feed-forward
activation by oxysterols and feedback repression by bile acids (i. 2). because the feedforward pathway is mediated by the liver x
receptor ( xxxg1596xxx ), a nuclear receptor that
binds oxysterols (3). are speculated that the
feedback repression pathway may also be
regulated by a ~luclearreceptor that can bind
to bile acids. the olyhan receptor fxr (also
called  xxxg1597xxx ) is an ideal candidate for the
 xxxg1597xxx . because it is specifically
expressed in tissues where bile acids function
(such as the liver, intestine. and kidney): it is
evolutioaarily related to  xxxg1596xxx : and, like 0ther class i1 lluclear receptors, it functio~lsas a
heterodimer with the retinoid x receptor
(rxr) (4-6). in addition. several isoprenoid
lipids can weakly activate fxr at supraphysiological concentrations; howex-er, these

l d not

and do not bind as ligands (4, 7 ) . thus. the
identity and physiologic functioll of fxr ligands have remaiaed unl<noa~n.
to test the hqyotl~esisthat fxr is the bile
acid receptor, ~nurineor human fxr expression plaslllids were transfected into mo~ll<ey
kidney cv-1 cells or lmmaa hepatoilla hepg2
cells. cells were then treated wit11 a series of

ability of conjugated bile acids to bind fxr in
vitro but not to transactivate fxr in cells is
presumably due to the absence in these cells of
the ileal bile acid transporter (i-bat), which is
required for conjugated bile acid uptake (i 7).
the accompanying paper by parks et al. (18)
confirms this notion by demonstrating that conjugated bile acids become efficient fxr activators in cells expressing i-bat. neither
 xxxd1660xxx  nor other tested bile acids induced interaction of  xxxg1510xxx  or lxxll peptides with
other nuclear receptors (such as  xxxg1596xxx , peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-?, or
m a ) , and ligands for these other receptors
did not promote the association of fxr with
 xxxg1510xxx  or lxxll peptides (19). together,
these data provide convincing evidence that bile
acids bind to fxr as ligands.
the retum of bile acids to the liver is
thought to be facilitated by specific binding
proteins that transport bile acids across intestinal enterocytes. one of these proteins is the
cytosolic  xxxg755xxx 
( xxxg755xxx ) (8). expression of the gene encoding
 xxxg755xxx  increases in response to bile acids (20).
to determine whether this response is induced
by fxr acting as a  xxxg1597xxx , approximately 1 kb of the 5'-flanking promoter region
of the mouse  xxxg755xxx  gene was linked to a
luciferase reporter gene @ibabp,,,-luc) and
tested for fxr-specific activation in a cotransfection assay. this portion of the  xxxg755xxx  promoter is sufficient for proper in vivo expression
of  xxxg755xxx  (21) and contains an inverted repeat
sequence that may function as an fxr-specific
bile acid response element (fig. 2a).  xxxd1660xxx 
induced expression of the  xxxg755xxx -luc reporter gene 12-fold in the presence of fxr a d
29-fold when fxr was coexpressed with an
increased amount of its heterodimeric partner
rxr. truncation of the  xxxg755xxx  promoter to

within 500 base pairs (bp) of the start site
@ibabp,,-luc) resulted in a similar cdcainduced response (fig. 2c). the rank order of
potency of the various bile acids for fxrspecific induction of  xxxg755xxx  reporter gene expression (fig. 2d) was identical to that demonstrated in vivo (8).finally, mutation of the ir-1
in the  xxxg755xxx  promoter completely eliminated
activation by  xxxd1660xxx  (fig. 2e). this ir-1 sequence alone drove  xxxd1660xxx - and fxr-dependent activation (10).
in addition to regulating their own transport, bile acids also regulate their synthesis
by feedback that represses the expression of
cholesterol 7a-hydroxylase(cyp7a), the ratelimiting enzyme (2). in keeping with the notion that this regulation is also mediated by
fxr, the rank order of bile acids that repress
endogenous expression of human cyp7a protein (fig. 3a) and mrna (fig. 3b) in a
hepatocyte-derived cell line was identical to
that for binding and activating fxr. in addition, significant repression of a luciferase
reporter containing the cyp7a gene promoter
occurred only when fxr, but not other nuclear receptors, was expressed (fig. 3c).
fxr-mediated repression of the cyp7a promoter by  xxxd1660xxx  was dose-dependent and had
an ec,, of 20 p.m (fig. 3d). feedback regulation of bile acid synthesis is conserved
between human and murine species, and
 xxxd1660xxx -mediated repression of the rat cyp7a
promoter also required fxr (10).
the above results show that bile acid regulation of  xxxg755xxx  and cyp7a gene expression
depends on the presence of fxr in a manner
consistent with fxr's role as a  xxxg1597xxx . that fxr functions as a  xxxg1597xxx 
suggests an expanded model for the regulation
of cholesterol homeostasis by nuclear receptors
(fig. 4). the accumulation of dietary cholester-

fig. 4. model of the transcriptional control of
cholesterol and bile acid homeostasis by nuclear receptors.

01 in the liver results in the synthesis of oxysterols that bind to  xxxg1596xxx .  xxxg1596xxx  activation in
tum eniiances the catabolic clearance of cholesterol by increasing bile acid synthesis and excretion. as demonstrated in this work, elevated
bile acids regulate their synthesis and transport
through their nuclear receptor fxr. thus, bile
acids are able to efficiently repress their further
synthesis in the liver and increase the synthesis
of transport proteins in the intestine. the discovery of oxysterol and bile acid signaling
pathways mediated by nuclear receptors complements the extensive pioneering studies that
have defined the intricate feedback and feedforward control of sterol metabolism (22). furthemore, the observation that  xxxg1596xxx  and fxr
function as key regulators of cholesterol and
bile acid homeostasis has important therapeutic
implications for the discovery of drugs targeted
against these receptors.

23. cv-1 cells were cotransfected with a rat fxr expression plasmid, a luciferase reporter construct containing five copies of an ir-i response element, and a
p-galactosidase (p-gal) expression vector as a marker as described (4, 73). transfected cells were treated
with various compounds (sigma) for 36 hours and
then harvested for luciferase assay. for hepg2 cells
cotransfected with human fxr, the luciferase reporter plasmid contained three copies of the ir-i (aggtcaatgacct), and cells were treated for 20 hours
with compounds before being harvested. cotransfections with gal4-receptor chimeras included a luciferase reporter gene ((25-luc) containing five copies of
the gal4 dna binding site. transfection data were
normalized t o p-gal, are expressed relative t o ethanol solvent controls as fold induction or relative light
units (rlus), and represent triplicate assays -c sd.
24. hek-293 cells were transfected with plasmids expressing the chimeric proteins gal4- xxxg1510xxx  (amino
acids 583 through 783), fxr (amino acids 105
through 472)-vp16, and the g5-luc reporter. luciferase activity was measured as in (23).
25. the fxr lbd (amino acids 105 through 472) was
fused t o the cooh-terminus of  xxxg1073xxx  (gst), and the resultant gst-fxr protein was
expressed in escherichia coli and then purified on
glutathione beads. for the fret assay, a europiumlabeled antibody t o gst [anti-gst-(eu)] (wallac,
gaithersburg, md) was used t o tag gst-fxr.  xxxg1510xxx 
(amino acids 595 through 822) was tagged with
hexahistidine, expressed in e. coli, purified by metal
ion chromatography, biotinylated, and labeled with

fluorophore allophycocyanin (apc) (wallac) conjugated t o streptavidin. fret occurs in solution when
ligand-mediated changes in the conformation of fxr
increase its affinity for  xxxg1510xxx , resulting in energy
transfer from europium (337 n m excitation and 620
n m emission) t o apc (620 nm excitation and 665 n m
emission). results are expressed as a ratio of apc t o
europium fluorescence (665 nml620 nm). to each
well of a black polypropylene 96-well plate was
added 10 nm gst-fxr, 100 nm biotin- xxxg1510xxx , antigst-(eu) (0.2 kglml), apc-streptavidin (1 pglml),
and the indicated compound in 100 p1 of buffer [ i 0 0
m m hepes (ph 7.6), 0.125% chaps, and 125 m m
naf]. the reaction was mixed and incubated for 12
hours at 4"c, and fluorescence was measured on a
victor ii plate reader (wallac). for elisa, 1.5 p m
biotin-labeled peptide (amino acid sequence ile-leuarg-lys-leu-leu-gln-glu) was incubated with 100
nm gst-fxr and the indicated compound in 100 p1
of buffer [25 m m tris-hci (ph 7.4) and 150 m m
naci] in a 96-well plate for 1 hour. the plate was
washed and incubated with rabbit antibody t o gst,
and gst-fxr protein bound t o streptavidin was
quantitated with a horseradish peroxidase-labeled
antibody t o rabbit.
26. cv-1 cells were cotransfected as in fig. 1 with rat
fxr and  xxxg1998xxx  expression plasmids and with the
indicated luciferase reporter genes. to create the
reporter genes, the first 1031 bp (plbabp,,,,-luc)
or
496 bp (plbabp,,,-luc)
of the mouse  xxxg755xxx  gene

promoter (27) were amplified by polymerase chain
reaction (pcr) from mouse genomic dna and ligated
into a luc reporter plasmid (73). the mutant reporter
(plbabp,,,.,42-luc)
was made from the plbabp4,,luc reporter by site-directed mutagenesis within the
 xxxg755xxx  promoter sequence -142 t o -130 (fig. za),
which converts nucleotides aggtgaataacct t o
agtgaataaet.
27. human cyp7a mrna was quantitated from hepg2
cells that were treated with the indicated compounds
using a taqman one step gold reverse transcriptase
(rt) pcr kit (applied biosystemsiperkin elmer). the
cyp7a primers used were cyp7-78: 5'-tgatttgggggattgctata; cyp7-178: 5'-catacctgggctgtgctct; and cyp7-132(fam): 5'- (6-fam) tggttcacccgtttgccttctcct (tamra). analysis was
performed in triplicate parallel assays.

bile acids regulate the transcription of genes that control cholesterol homeostasis through molecular mechanisms that are poorly understood. physiological concentrations of free and conjugated chenodeoxycholic acid, lithocholic acid, and  xxxd1835xxx  activated the  xxxg1597xxx  (fxr;
nrlh4), an orphan nuclear receptor. as ligands, these bile acids and their
conjugates modulated interaction of fxr with a peptide derived from steroid
receptor coactivator 1. these results provide evidence for a nuclear bile acid
signaling pathway that may regulate cholesterol homeostasis.

cholesterol homeostasis is achieved through
the coordinate regulation of dietary cholesterol uptake, endogenous biosynthesis. and the
disposal of cholesterol in the form of bile
acids. bile acids are not simply metabolic
by-products. but are essential for appropriate
absorption of dietary lipids and also regulate
gene transcription. among the genes regulated by bile acids are cholesterol 7a-hydroxylase (cyp7a). the rate-limiting enzyme in bile
acid biosynthesis ( i ) , and the intestinal bile
acid-binding protein ( xxxg755xxx ), a cytosolic
protein that serves as a component of the bile

(2).  xxxg755xxx  gene expression is induced preferentially by chenodeoxycholic acid ( xxxd1660xxx )
relative to other more hydrophilic bile acids
(3).
to examine whether  xxxd1660xxx  mediates its
transcriptional effects through an orphan
member of the steroid-retinoid-thyroid  xxxg1603xxx  family (4);
we used a chimeric
receptor system in which the putative ligandbinding domain (lbd) of the human orphan
receptor is fused to the dna binding domain
of the yeast transcription factor gal4 (5). in
cv-1 cells,  xxxd1660xxx  selectively activated fxr
[ xxxg1597xxx ] (fig. l), an orphan nuclear receptor
expressed predominantly in the liver, kidney,
intestine, and adrenals (6, 7). this strong
activation by  xxxd1660xxx  was unanticipated because fxr responds to high concentrations
of famesoids ( 6 ) and retinoids (8).
