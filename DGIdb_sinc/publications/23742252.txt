preliminary structure-activity relationships (sar) are described as well as the rational design strategy
employed to overcome the development deficiencies of the first generation alk inhibitor 4 ( xxxd3273xxx ).
compound 15b is currently in phase 1 and 2 clinical trials with substantial antitumor activity being
observed in alk-positive cancer patients.
introduction
 xxxg144xxx  (alk) is a receptor  xxxg2198xxx  of the  xxxg1194xxx  superfamily.
expression of alk in normal human tissues is only found in a subset of neural cells.1 however, altered
expression and hyperactivation of alk as a consequence of translocations or point mutations has been
demonstrated to be an essential oncogenic lesion in a number of cancers.2-4 to date, no essential role has
been found for alk in mammals. mice deficient in alk have normal development and display an
anti-depressive phenotype with enhanced performance in hippocampus-dependent tasks, potentially due
to increased hippocampal progenitor cells.5
deregulation of alk was first identified in anaplastic large cell lymphoma (alcl), where the
 xxxg2198xxx  domain is fused to  xxxg1584xxx  (npm), a product of recurrent t(2;5)(p23;q35)
chromosomal translocation.6 subsequently, chromosomal rearrangements resulting in alk fused to
various partner genes have been found in nearly 70% of alcl, 40-60% of inflammatory
myofibroblastic tumors (imt),7 a few dozen cases of diffuse large b-cell lymphoma (dlbcl), and,
most recently, in 2-7% of non-small cell lung cancer (nsclc).8-10 among fusion partner genes
identified to date, npm is the most common partner in alcl and echinoderm microtubule-associated
protein-like-4 ( xxxg700xxx ) is the main partner in nsclc. in addition to the chromosomal rearrangements
that result in alk fusion genes, amplification of alk gene and activating point mutations in the full
length alk gene have recently been reported in neuroblastoma,11-13 inflammatory breast cancer,14 and
ovarian cancer.15

multiple pharmaceutical companies have described alk inhibitors (alki) at various stages of
development. 16-24 structures of alki in clinical development are depicted in figure 1. compound 1
(pf-02441066,  xxxd1761xxx )25-28 was approved in 2011 by the fda to treat alk-positive nsclc
patients. other alk inhibitors, including 3 ( xxxd104xxx , roche/chugai),29-30 5 ( xxxd229xxx , astellas),31
2 ( xxxd3537xxx , x-covery),32  xxxd366xxx  (ariad pharmaceuticals. structure undisclosed; series exemplified as
compound 6),33-34 tesaro (structure undisclosed) and 15b ( xxxd460xxx , novartis),35a are currently in phase
1/2 clinical trials.

compound 4 is a potent alk inhibitor; however, it was found to form an extensive number of
reactive adducts upon metabolic oxidation, which creates the potential for significant toxicological
liabilities. semi-quantitative lc-ms analysis indicated that approximately 20% of 4 is converted into
reactive species when incubated in liver microsomes (table 2), and these reactive species can be trapped
using glutathione (gsh).

(supporting information, figure s9) and reducing the potential metabolic liability associated with
methoxy moieties.40 however, it was also found the formation of reactive adducts observed with 7 and
closely related analogues (unpublished results) was independent of the nature of alkoxy moiety present
on the molecules (table 2) confirming our hypothesis stated in figure 2. with this information in hand,
we took the decision to re-evaluate the sar around this scaffold and focus our efforts towards the
eradicating the reactive adducts that prevented 4 and some close analogues like 7 to enter into
development. in order to reach this goal, we chose to retain the iso-propylsulfoneaniline as well as the
iso-propoxy moieties, since these were shown to be important for potent and selective alk inhibition.
variations on this theme were synthesized and profiled (e.g., cyclobutylsulfoneaniline, n,ndimethylsulfonamide) to determine the moiety with the best overall development profile. we also
replaced the iso-propoxy with a cyclobutyloxy moiety, which is well-tolerated by alk. for the
compounds described in this report, we also kept the pyrimidine hinge-binding core constant, changing
only the 5-chloro substituent to a 5-methyl in the case of compounds 18a-d. as an additional point of
comparison, 23, which replaces the pyrimidine core with a pyridine, was synthesized. the focus of this
report is on the sar of the 4-position aniline ‘tail’ containing the solubilizing moiety. the sar

with the aim of designing novel derivatives that would not form reactive adducts, we made the
rational design decision to reverse the piperidine at the para position of the aniline moiety present in the
series of compounds represented by 4 in order to remove the possibility of a 1,4-diiminoquinone
formation. we also designed the inclusion of a methyl group para to the iso-propoxy moiety in order to
further reduce metabolism on the interior phenyl ring, thereby further reducing the possibility of
forming reactive metabolites.

the syntheses of the compounds 15a-e, 16a,b, 17a-i, 18a-d¸19, 20 and 23 are shown in schemes 1
and 2. the aniline moieties 8a-b were synthesized in 2 steps from 2-fluoronitrobenzene according to a

synthesized in 4-8 synthetic steps from 2-chloro-4-fluorotoluene or 3-chlorofluorobenzene, while 13f
was synthesized from 2,4-dichloro-5-nitropyrimidine using an identical synthetic route. nitration39 of 2chloro-4-fluorotoluene or 3-chlorofluorobenzene using kno3 in h2so4 yielded the corresponding nitro
derivatives 10a,b. condensation of 10a,b with iso- xxxd3026xxx  or cyclobutanol (60°c in the presence of

finally, subsequent piperidine alkylation or acylation afforded 17a-i and 18a-d in good overall yields.
compounds 19 and 20 followed a similar synthetic route, except 9a was coupled to 2-iso-propoxy-5methyl-4-(2-oxopiperidin-4-yl)benzenaminium 2,2,2-trifluoroacetate for 19 and 13f in the case of 20. in
order to synthesize compound 23, we had to reverse the synthetic sequence. amination of 4-bromo-2,5dichloropyridine with 13a (xantphos, pd(oac)

or an acetic acid (17g)] decreased alk inhibition activity. in contrast, addition of an  xxxd63xxx  (17h), a
n,n-dimethylaminoacetate (17i), or conversion to a cyclic lactam (19) were well-tolerated for alk
inhibition and retained selectivity versus  xxxg1194xxx . a similar trend was observed in the karpas299 cell line.
23, in which we replaced the pyrimidine core with a pyridine, resulted in a large loss of potency. this
observation is consistent with the binding mode of these molecules in the atp-binding site. the n3 of
the pyrimidine make a key contact at the hinge (figure 4) and therefore, removing this key interaction
considerably lowers affinity of compound 23. we synthesized and profiled a number of minor variations
of 15b to identify the best development candidate. substitutions in 15d, 15e, 16b, and 20 were tolerated
but did not show any significant development advantages over 15b. a selected set of the compounds
from table 1 was tested in the gsh-trapping assay to evaluate their potential to form reactive adducts.
the data are shown in table 2. all the derivatives tested were found to have close to undetectable levels
of gsh adducts (<1%) when submitted to the same assay conditions as 4 and 7 (supporting information,
figures s1-s4), experimentally confirming the validity of our rational designs.

figure 4. docking of 15b in the alk kinase domain.

we performed molecular modeling of 15b based upon the reported crystal structure of  xxxd3273xxx  with
the kinase domain of alk.42 as expected, the ligand makes hydrogen bonds at the hinge area via the
pyrimidine and amino nitrogen atoms onto the backbone nitrogen and oxygen of met1199 respectively.
our model, shown in figure 4, does not show the hydrogen bond between the carbonyl oxygen of
met1199 and the amino nitrogen of the inhibitor, even though they are within the range of a typical
hydrogen bond, both distance- and angle-wise. the reason is that these two atoms occupy different
planes, probably due to constraints of the crystal structure. we expect that they form a hydrogen bond in
the context of a conformationally flexible protein in solution. the central pyrimidine ring of the
inhibitor is sandwiched between ala1148 and leu1256 and its chlorine substituent is directed towards the
back of the pocket making hydrophobic contact with gatekeeper leu1196. the piperidine ring extends to
the solvent and is engaged in a salt bridge with glu1210. the sulfonyl makes an intramolecular h-bond

stk22d with ic50’s of 8, 7 and 23 nm respectively. compound 15b is very potent against alk at the
enzymatic level (ic50 of 200 pm) thus its selectivity against these off-targets is 80-, 70- and 230-fold,
respectively. when tested in a cellular proliferation panel of 39 kinases, 15b proved to be very selective.
aside from alk, no inhibition below 100 nm was observed for all kinases tested and the potent
inhibitions observed for  xxxg1145xxx  and  xxxg801xxx  at the enzymatic level proved to be non-reproducible in a
cellular context (ic50 of 410 and 3143 nm respectively). likewise, cellular inhibition of  xxxg792xxx  and
 xxxg794xxx  was found to be > 2 µm. we could not establish a cellular assay for stk22d but its inhibition
was deemed to not be prohibitive for clinical development.

compound 15b was tested in mouse, rat, dog and monkey for its pk profile (table 6). the compound
exhibited low plasma clearance in animals (mouse, rat, dog and monkey) compared to liver blood flow.
the volume of distribution at steady state (vss) was high and approximately 10-fold greater than total
body water. half-life (t1/2) ranged from moderate to long (6.2 to 26 hrs). following a single oral
administration of 15b as a solution or suspension, the oral bioavailability was good (≥55%) in mouse,
rat, dog and monkey. time of maximal concentration (tmax) occurred consistently late in animal species
tested, indicating slow oral absorption. overall, 15b displays a consistent pk profile across all species
tested. although compound 15a, which deletes the methyl para to the alkoxy group in 15b, was fully
tolerated by alk, 15a displayed significantly worse oral bioavailability in rat compared to 15b (12%f
vs. 66%f).

results are consistent with our previous observations (karpas299 is a much more aggressive in
vivo model than h2228) as well with the relative potency of 15b against the npm-alk and
 xxxg700xxx -alk fusions (26.0 and 2.2 nm respectively)
a single-dose pk/pd experiment was performed in the rat karpas299 model at 50 mg/kg, and
the biomarker pstat3 response correlated well with the tumor regression observed in the
xenograft study. figure 7 shows the plot of plasma and tumor drug concentrations (left-hand side
of the graph) versus pstat3 inhibition (right-hand side of the graph). upon single-dose oral
administration at 50 mg/kg, sustained pstat3 inhibition (about 80%) was observed through 72
hours, which paralleled the sustained tumor concentrations of 15b.
in contrast to the first-generation alk inhibitor 4, compound 15b showed no impact on
insulin levels or plasma glucose utilization (tested via an oral glucose tolerance test) in the
mouse upon chronic dosing up to 100 mg/kg (data not shown). this lack of in vivo effect on
 xxxg1194xxx  was confirmed using a homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance
(homa-ir; ogtt/itt ratio) in the same animals (figure 8). this in vivo selectivity is not fully
understood at this time (the in vitro selectivity versus the  xxxg1194xxx  is comparable between 4 and 15b)
but indicates an additional advantage of 15b over 4.

consistent pk profile across species (mouse, rat, dog and monkey) and displayed strong in vivo
efficacy in alcl and nsclc cancer xenograft models at well-tolerated doses. compound 15b
also showed an improved profile in terms of in vivo glucose homeostasis over 4 when examined
in mouse ogtt experiments. for these reasons, compound 15b was chosen to move into
development and is currently being evaluated in alk-positive patients44 where it has displayed
substantial preliminary antitumor clinical activity.45

experimental section

unless otherwise noted, materials were obtained from commercial suppliers and were used
without further purification. removal of solvent under reduced pressure or concentration refers
to distillation using bu chi rotary evaporator attached to a vacuum pump (3 mmhg). products
obtained as solids or high boiling oils were dried under vacuum (1 mmhg).
purification of compounds by preparative rp-hplc was achieved using a waters
autopurification system consisting of a 2767 autosampler/fraction collector, a 2525 binary
gradient module, a 2487 uv detector, and a zq mass spectrometer. compounds were purified
using flow rate of 30 ml/min with a 50 mm × 20 mm i.d. ultra 120 5 µm c18q column (peeke
scientific, novato, ca). a 7.5 min linear gradient from 10% solvent a (acetonitrile with 0.035%
trifluoroacetic acid) in solvent b (water with 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid) to 30-90% a was used,
followed by a 2.5 min hold at 90% a. silica gel chromatography was performed either by
combiflash (separation system sg. 100c, isco) or using silica gel (merck kieselgel 60, 230–
400 mesh). elemental analyses were carried out by midwest microlabs llc, indianapolis, in.

nmr data are reported as multiplicity (s, singlet; d, doublet; t, triplet; q, quartet; quint,
quintuplet; sept septuplet; dd, doublet of doublets; dt, doublet of triplets; bs, broad singlet). for
spectra obtained in cdcl3, dmso-d6, cd3od, the residual protons (7.27, 2.50, and 3.31 ppm,
respectively) were used as the internal reference.
purity of compounds
all compounds were analyzed with a waters zq 2000 lc/ms system, which used an agilent
binary pump and photodiode array detector (pda) along with a sedere 75 evaporative light
scattering detector (elsd). samples were injected from 96-well or 384-well plates with a leap
technologies hts pal autosampler. the mobile phases used were (a) h2o + 0.05% tfa and
(b) acetonitrile + 0.035% tfa. a gradient hplc method with flow of 1.0 ml/min started at 5%
b, with a hold of 0.1 min before a linear increase to 95% b at 2.70 min. at 2.71 min the b
mobile phase was increased to 100% and held until 2.98 min. total run time was 3.0 min. the
column used was a waters atlantis dc18 2.1 mm × 30 mm, 3 µm. the mass spectrometer was
operated in positive mode, with a spray voltage of 3.2 kv and cone voltage of 30 v. the source
and desolvation temperatures were 130 and 400 °c, respectively, with 600 l/h of nitrogen
desolvation flow. the progress of reactions and the purity of products were measured using 254
and 220 nm wavelengths and electrospray ionization (esi) positive mode. mass spectra were
obtained in esi positive mode. all the reported compounds were found to be >95% when
analyzed at the 254 nm wavelength.

the murine pro-b cell line ba/f3, human cell line karpas-299 were maintained in rpmi
medium 1640 supplemented with 10% fbs. ba/f3 cells were grown in the presence of  xxxg1177xxx  (10
ng/ml). ba/f3 cells were used to generate a panel of sublines whose proliferation and survival
was rendered  xxxg1177xxx -independent by stable transduction with individual tyrosine kinases activated
by fusion with the amino-terminal portion of tel (amino acid 1-375), or with bcr-abl, npmalk, or  xxxg700xxx -alk. cell lines expressing luciferase alone or in combination with fusion
constructs were generated by retroviral transduction of cells with pmscv ires puro/luc vector.

cell proliferation assays.
luciferase-expressing cells were incubated with serial dilutions of compounds or dmso for
2–3 days. luciferase expression was used as a measure of cell proliferation/survival and was
evaluated with the bright-glo luciferase assay system (promega, madison, wi). ic50 values
were generated by using xlfit software.

enzymatic kinase profiling description.
all kinases were expressed as either histidine- or gst-tagged fusion proteins using the
baculovirus expression technology except for the untagged  xxxg1366xxx  which was produced in e. coli.
 xxxg227xxx , jak2, mk2, syk and pka were purchased from invitrogen,  xxxg1366xxx  from
proqinase and all other kinases were supplied in-house. the kinase activity was measured in the
labchip mobility-shift assay (perkinelmer). the assay was performed at 30°c for 60 min.
the effect of compound on the enzymatic activity was obtained from the linear progress curves
in the absence and presence of compound and routinely determined from one reading (end point
measurement).

containing 1 mg protein/ml with phosphate buffer. four microliters of a 0.5 mm of 20 µl
dmso stock solution of compound in 180 µl of a mixture of acetonitrile/water (ratio 1:1) was
added to 50 µl of 1 mg/ml of liver microsomes in phosphate buffer and pre-incubated for 3 min
at 37 °c. after pre-incubation, the reaction was started by addition of 50 µl of the nadph
(1 mmol/l), udpga (1 mmol/l), mgcl (2 mmol/l) and ethylester gsh reduced (2 mmol/l).
after 60 min, the reaction was stopped with 200 µl ice-cold acetonitrile. the reaction mixture
was stored at -20 °c. the mixture was centrifuged (10000 g, 5 min) and 250 µl of 300 µl
supernatant was transferred. from this solution, 20 µl aliquots were used for analysis. the liquid
chromatographic separation was performed using an agilent hp1100 pump (agilent
technologies, wilmington, de) and a phenyl hexylrp column, 150 mm x 2.0 mm, particle size
4.6 µm. gradient mobile phase programming was used with a flow rate of 350 µl/min. eluent a
was milli-q water with 0.1%  xxxd2154xxx . eluent b was acetonitrile with 0.1%  xxxd2154xxx . the
mobile phase was a linear gradient from 5% b to 95% b over 6 min and held for 2 min at 95% b
for a total run time of 10 minutes. the column effluent was introduced directly into the ion
source of a triple quadrupole ms (ts-quantum, finnigan, san jose, ca) or ion trap ms
(decaxp, finnigan, san jose, ca). the ionization technique employed was positive electrospray
(es). the quantum was used in a product ion scan mode, utilizing collision induced dissociation
in q2 (collision chamber). collision gas was argon. the collision energy was set at 30 ev.

homa-ir
homeostatic model assessment (homa) of insulin resistance (ir) is a technical method for
assessing ir from basal (fasting) glucose and insulin or c-peptide concentrations. the model is
widely used to estimate insulin resistance.48
groups of wild-type mice (n=8 mice per group) were randomized into treatment groups based
on their initial body weight. mice were housed four per cage and dosed with vehicle orally, or
alk inhibitor (15b or 4), orally once per day for seven days. on day 7, compound was
administered 180 minutes prior to a 3 g/kg glucose bolus. ogtt evaluations were performed in
conscious mice that were 11 weeks of age. the mice were fasted by removing food at 6 p.m. the
day before. a baseline blood sample was taken at t = - 180 minutes and the mice were then
dosed orally with the compounds. a baseline blood sample was taken at t = 0 minutes and the
animals were then administered an oral glucose bolus (3 g/kg) immediately. blood was obtained
(via tail bleeding) to measure blood glucose (using glucometer). a single drop of blood from the
tail was measured for glucose using a glucometer at t = -180, 0, 20, 40, 60, 120 minutes.
approximately 40 µl samples of blood were collected separately for insulin analysis 3 hours
prior to dosing (on day 0 and day 7) into chilled collection tubes containing edta. plasma was
isolated and stored at -70°c until further analysis. the homeostatic model assessment–insulin
resistance index (homa-ir) was used as a measure of insulin resistance and was calculated
using the formula: homa-ir = (fpg * fpi) / 22.5 where fpg (mm) is the fasting plasma

glucose concentration, fpi (µu/ml) is the fasting plasma insulin concentration. insulin levels
were determined using a detection assay kit from mesoscale discovery (msd): catalog#
k112bzc-2. higher values indicate insulin resistance.

modeling and docking

flexible docking was performed using glide 5.8 (schrodinger, inc, portland, or, 2012). the
protein coordinates were taken from protein databank (2xb7.pdb). the grid box was centered on
the co-crystallized ligand 15b and extended 10 å from the center, with outer box extending an
additional 20 a. the ligand was docked using the standard precision (sp) algorithm and scored
using glidescore.

in mcmm/llmod method the structural perturbation via llmod method is alternated with
the random changes in torsion angles and/or molecular position from mcmm method. during
the llmod structural perturbation and subsequent minimization, protein residues within 4 å
from the bound ligand were allowed to move freely. the remaining residues were not allowed to
move, however their electrostatic and van der waals interactions with moving atoms was
included in the calculation. the inhibitor was subjected to perturbations via tors command
available in macromodel. the llmod step was applied using a leap vectors comprised of
different random mixtures of the first 10 nontrivial low-modes and the fastest-moving atom with
respect to the particular leap vector was displaced by a randomly selected distance between 3 - 6
å. during the tors move randomly selected torsion angle was perturbed by a random value
between 0 – 180°. a conjugate gradient minimization was employed during the conformational
