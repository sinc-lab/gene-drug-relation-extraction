the  xxxg371xxx  plays an
important role as an entry gate for the human immunodeficiency virus-1 (hiv-1) and for viral postentry
events. among signal transducers used by chemoattractant receptors, the phosphatidylcholine-specific phospholipase d (pld) produces large amounts of second
messengers in most cell types. however, the relevance
of pld isoforms to ccr5 signaling and hiv-1 infection process remains unexplored. we show here that
ccr5 activation by mip-1␤ in hela-magi cells triggered a rapid and substantial pld activity, as assessed
by mass choline production. this activity required the
activation of  xxxg1369xxx /2-map kinases and involved both
 xxxg1772xxx  and  xxxg1773xxx . mip-1␤ also promoted the activation
of an hiv-1 long terminal repeat (ltr) by the transactivator tat in hela p4.2 cells through a process involving  xxxg1369xxx /2. expression of wild-type and catalytically
inactive plds dramatically boosted and inhibited the
ltr activation,respectively, without altering tat expression. wild-type and inactive plds also respectively
potentiated and inhibited hiv-1bal replication in magi
cells. finally, in monocytic thp-1 cells, antisense oligonucleotides to both plds dramatically inhibited the
hiv-1 replication. thus, pld is activated downstream
of  xxxg1369xxx /2 upon ccr5 activation and plays a major
role in promoting hiv-1 ltr transactivation and virus
replication, which may open novel perspectives to
anti-hiv-1 strategies.—paruch, s., heinis, m., lemay,

abstract

key words: hiv-1 coreceptors 䡠 signal transducers 䡠 infection
ccr5 is a chemoattractant receptor for several
chemokines (mip-1␣, mip-1␤, and  xxxg363xxx ) that plays
an important role in the early phases of infection by the
human immunodeficiency virus 1 (hiv-1). ccr5 is a
leukocyte coreceptor of hiv-1 (1) that interacts with
the viral envelope glycoprotein gp120 after the latter
binds to cd4, the main hiv-1 receptor. only hiv-1
isolates that bind to ccr5 were shown to infect macro4038

phages, which are major reservoirs of the virus (2).
structural protein rearrangements allow the viral transmembrane subunit gp41 to fuse the viral envelope with
the membrane of target cells, thereby facilitating hiv-1
uptake. the provirus genome is subjected to reverse
transcription (3, 4) and integration into the host genome, and can establish a latent infection (5, 6). hiv-1
replication is dependent on activation of a single
promoter present in the long terminal repeat (ltr)
region of hiv-1 genome that contains binding sites for
the hiv-1  xxxg515xxx  tat (7, 8) and for
various endogenous transcription factors (9, 10). viral
replication requires a state of activation of host cells
since hiv-1 does not infect resting cd4⫹ t cells from
peripheral blood (3, 11). consistent with an important
role for cellular signaling in hiv-1 infection, cell stimulation by mitogens such as phorbol esters up-regulates
the activation of hiv-1 ltr and viral replication,
supporting a role for protein kinase c (pkc) (12–14).
other signaling transducers have been shown to be
involved, including g-proteins (15, 17),  xxxg1743xxx -kinase
(18), nf-␬b (19), and  xxxd1355xxx /42 map kinases ( xxxg1369xxx /2)
(20), although relationships between these effectors
remain unclear. characterization of all of the signaling
events mediated by ccr5 is needed to unravel hiv
pathogenesis.
among the major intracellular signaling effectors
activated by classical chemoattractants (formyl peptides, complement-derived c5a,  xxxd2973xxx ), the phosphatidylcholine (pc)-specific phospholipase d (pld) was lately identified in mammalian cells
and proven to be an important source of several second
messengers in most cell types (21, 22). so far, pld
activity in response to activation of the hiv-1 coreceptors ccr5 or cxcr4 remains uncharacterized. pld
cleaves pc into choline and a lipid second messenger,
phosphatidic acid (pa). the latter is rapidly dephosphorylated into diglycerides (dg) (23) whereas choline

is converted into a second messenger,  xxxd2929xxx  (24).
two distinct families of plds,  xxxg1772xxx  and  xxxg1773xxx , have
been cloned in mammalian cells and share ⬃50%
amino acid identity (25). however, both plds show a
different intracellular distribution and are activated
differently, suggesting they regulate different biological
functions (23). we recently provided evidence that
 xxxd1355xxx /42 map kinases use the  xxxg1773xxx  isoform to regulate
the respiratory burst of hl-60 cells upon activation of
fpr by formyl peptides (26). this receptor is also
activated by hiv-1 gp41-derived peptides (27). we
further showed that the  xxxg1773xxx  isoform is directly phosphorylated by  xxxg1366xxx  (26). this novel erk/ xxxg1773xxx  pathway raises the possibility that some biological functions
ascribed to  xxxg1369xxx /2 may actually be relayed by pld. so
far, the biological importance of pld isoforms in ccr5
signaling and regulation of hiv-1 gene expression and
replication remains unknown.
in this study we characterized the pld activity in
response to activation of ccr5 in human hela cells
stably expressing the hiv-1 coreceptor. taking advantage of the expression of pld variants and antisense
oligonucleotides, we further investigated the contribution of both pld isoforms,  xxxg1772xxx  and  xxxg1773xxx , to activation of hiv-1 ltr by the viral transactivator tat and to
virus replication. our data indicate that ccr5 mediates
pld stimulation through activation of  xxxg1369xxx /2 and that
the activity of both pld isoforms strongly contributes to
the transactivation of hiv-1 ltr and viral replication.

gény (pasteur institute, paris, france). the soluble hiv-1
glycoprotein gp120 was obtained through the nih aids
research and reference reagent program catalog of the

oligodeoxynucleotides, antisense, and sense to plds were
synthesized by invitrogen and were used earlier with success
in hl-60 cells (26). the sequence of oligodeoxynucleotides
was derived from published coding sequences of pld cdna,
i.e.,  xxxg1772xxx  antisense (5⬘-ccgtggctcgtttttcagtgacat-3⬘),  xxxg1773xxx  antisense (5⬘-agggtcttctgggttacagtcat-3⬘),  xxxg1772xxx  (scrambled) sense (5⬘-ttcacgcctgaatgttctctgtgt-3⬘), and  xxxg1773xxx  (scrambled) sense (5⬘-tgtgcggtttattcggaggcaat-3⬘). sirna for  xxxg1772xxx  ( xxxg1772xxx

plds in ccr5 signaling to hiv-1 infection

sirna for  xxxg1773xxx  ( xxxg1773xxx  target sequence 5⬘-gacacaaagucuugaugag) were synthesized by sigma-proligo (sigmaaldrich, st. louis, mo, usa) and designed according to fang
et al. (28) and powner et al. (29), respectively. a sirna
without sequence similarity with any known mammalian gene
(5⬘-cguacgcggaauacuucga) was used as a negative
control (30). all other reagents were purchased from sigma.
plasmids
plasmids encoding wild-type ha-tagged  xxxg1773xxx  and  xxxg1772xxx  or
their catalytically inactive variants,  xxxg1773xxx -dn (k758r) and
 xxxg1772xxx -dn (k898r), were kind gifts from dr. m. a. frohman
(31). plasmid encoding the constitutively active  xxxg1361xxx 
( xxxg1361xxx ) mutant in which the serine residues 218 and 222
were replaced by  xxxd2431xxx  (mek-ss/dd) in-frame with
an ha-tag (32) was kindly donated by j. pouyssegur (institute
of signaling, cnrs, nice, france). the plasmid pcta allowing hiv-1 tat expression was a kind gift from dr. m. marc
alizon (33).
cell lines and transfections
hela p4.2 cells stably express cd4 and bear the escherichia coli
␤-galactosidase gene (lacz) under transcriptional control of
the hiv-1 ltr (33). magi-ccr5 cells constitutively expressing both cd4 and ccr5 (34) are derived from hela p4.2
cells and are routinely used for hiv-1 replication (35). cells
were cultured under standard conditions (dmem, 10% fcs,
100 ␮g/ml streptomycin, and penicillin) and transfected with
3 ␮g of plasmid dna of interest using fugene 6 according
to the manufacturer’s instructions. the hela-env-ada and
the hela p4.2 target cells used in the cell fusion assay were
provided by dr. m. alizon (33). the hela-env-ada stably
expresses the r5-hiv-1ada strain and the hiv-1 transactivator
tat. the hela p4.2 stably expresses cd4 and bears the e. coli
␤-galactosidase gene (lacz) under transcriptional control of
the hiv-1 ltr (33). the monocytic thp-1 cells (a kind gift
from dr. philip g. strange, university of reading, reading,
uk) were grown in rpmi 1640 medium in standard conditions.
cell-cell fusion assays
target cells (⬃5⫻104 hela p4.2 cells) were dissociated with
5 mm edta and added to an equivalent number of adherent
hela env-ada in a 35-mm plate (33). after 24 h, cells were
fixed with 0.4% glutaraldehyde and stained with the ␤-galactosidase substrate x-gal (5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indoyl-␤-d-galactopyranoside). blue-stained foci representing syncytia were
counted under ⫻20 magnification. this model of cell fusion
requires ccr5 expression since, in the absence of ccr5,
basal values represented 1-4% of syncytia obtained with
ccr5-transfected cells.
hiv-1 infection assay
magi cells were plated (106 cells/ml) in 24-well plates and
transfected with an empty vector (pcdna3, control) or with
wild-type and inactive plds in conditions indicated in the
figure legends. the monocytic thp-1 cells were transfected
with 8 ␮m sense or  xxxg1772xxx  or  xxxg1773xxx  antisense oligonucleotides
in the presence of oligofectamine according to the manufacturer’s instructions. twelve hours after transfection, the medium was removed and cells were infected with monocytotropic hiv-1bal (10 ng gag p24 protein/million cells) for 3 h
at 37°c under 5% co2 in dmem supplemented with 1% fcs
4039

(36). cells were washed extensively and cultured in the same
medium. a fraction of the supernatant (100 ␮l) was collected
every 12 h for 4 days and stored at ⫺80°c to measure hiv-1
gene expression as determined by gag p24 elisa (immunogenetics nv, ghent, belgium). in some experiments, thp-1
cells were treated with 100 and 300 ng/ml pertussis toxin for
18 h before infection and throughout the assay, as described
(16). cell viability was determined using the trypan blue
assay.
pld and immunoblot assays
pld activity was studied by measuring mass choline production (37) with some adaptations for fluorometric measurements, as recently reported (26). hela magi cells were
starved with 0.05% bsa for 6-12 h, harvested with pbs
containing 10 mm etda, and suspended in hanks balanced
salt solution (hbss, ph 7.4). cells were stimulated at a
density of 2 ⫻ 106 cells/200 ␮l, as described in the figure
legends. choline content was calculated from calibration
curves obtained with exogenous choline chloride (5 to 50
pmol) and expressed as percent increase above basal control
values. in some experiments, cells were transfected with
either 3 ␮g plasmid encoding  xxxg1772xxx -dn,  xxxg1773xxx -dn or with 30
nm sirna using oligofectamine (invitrogen) according to
the manufacturer’s protocol. the cells were cultured for 36 h
in 1% fcs, then starved in the presence of 0.05% bsa for 6 h
before stimulation with mip-1␤.
immunoblot experiments were performed under standard
conditions using specific antibodies against phosphoerk1/2
(thr202/tyr204),  xxxg1369xxx /2, the ha epitope of  xxxg1772xxx  or
 xxxg1773xxx ), and endogeous plds, as described (26). enhanced
chemiluminescence was used to detect hpo-conjugated secondary antibody. in some experiments, membranes were
stripped and reprobed with antibodies of interest. quantification of phosphorylated proteins was performed with the
nih image 1.62 software (national institutes of health,
bethesda, md, usa).
statistical analysis
unless indicated otherwise, data represent means ⫾ se of at
least 3 experiments. differences between means were identified using a student’s paired t test or the 1-way anova test
for differences between distinct cell populations. statistically

significant differences between means were calculated with a
threshold of p ⬍ 0.05, designated by an asterisk.

ccr5-mediated pld activity in magi cells is
dependent on  xxxg1369xxx /2 activation
pld activity was studied in magi cells stably expressing
ccr5 and cd4 by measuring the production of mass
choline, as we previously reported (26). treatment of
cells in the presence of the specific ccr5 agonist, the
macrophage inflammatory protein 1-␤ (mip-1␤), triggered a rapid and transient production of choline
peaking at ⬃1-2 min (fig. 1a). this pld activity was
proportional to an mip-1␤ concentration up to 50 nm
(fig. 1b). we previously showed that pld activity
induced by the chemoattractant f-met-leu-phe (fmlp)
is dependent on activation of the  xxxd1355xxx /42 map kinases
( xxxg1369xxx /2) (26). to determine the contribution of
 xxxg1369xxx /2 to ccr5-mediated pld activity, magi cells
were treated with a specific  xxxg1361xxx /2 antagonist,  xxxd3462xxx ,
under conditions that blocked erk activation (fig.
1d).  xxxd3462xxx  also abrogated mip-1␤-induced choline
production, suggesting a major contribution of
 xxxg1369xxx /2 to pld activity mediated after the interaction
of ccr5 with mip-1␤ (fig. 1c). since ccr5 also
interacts with the hiv-1 envelope glycoprotein gp120
as part of the virus entry process, we examined whether
gp120 stimulates pld activity. treatment of magi cells
with soluble gp120 (40, 80, and 160 nm) triggered a
rapid and transient choline production proportional to
the stimulus concentration (⬃75, 85, and 105% increase above basal choline values). this stimulation was
inhibited by ⬃50% by  xxxd3462xxx , indicating a significant
contribution of  xxxg1369xxx /2.
next, the contribution of pld isoforms  xxxg1772xxx  and
 xxxg1773xxx  to choline production in magi cells was studied
using the transient expression of a catalytically inactive

mutant of  xxxg1773xxx  ( xxxg1773xxx -dn) or  xxxg1772xxx  ( xxxg1772xxx -dn) (fig.
2a). both pld mutants reduced basal pld activity
by ⬃30-35% (data not shown). the expression of
 xxxg1772xxx -dn and  xxxg1773xxx -dn strongly inhibited mip-1␤induced pld activity (fig. 2b). because the expression
of pld variants could lead to side effects, the contribution of both plds was further examined using a sirnabased approach. treatment of magi cells with 30 nm
sirna for 48 h significantly reduced the expression of
both plds by ⬃50-60% (fig. 2c). both sirnas reduced
basal pld activity by ⬃40-50% whereas the mip-1␤induced choline production was strongly inhibited
(fig. 2d), confirming a major contribution of both
plds observed with the pld mutants.
contribution of pld isoforms to activation of the
hiv-1 ltr
to investigate the relevance of pld activity in regulating hiv-1 infection parameters, we first used a cell-cell
fusion model (syncytium) that mimics early steps of
hiv-1 entry into ccr5/cd4⫹ cells and the activation
of hiv-1 ltr (33). in this cell-cell fusion assay, the viral
transactivator tat is transferred from hela-env-ada
cells to target hela p4.2 cells, which allows the ltrlacz gene to be activated. target cells that constitutively express cd4 were cotransfected with ccr5 and
an empty vector (pcdna3), with catalytically inactive
pld isoform  xxxg1772xxx -dn or  xxxg1773xxx -dn, or wild-type  xxxg1772xxx 
or  xxxg1773xxx . incubation of these cells with adherent helaenv-ada resulted in the formation of ccr5-dependent
syncytia, as revealed by ␤-galactosidase-positive cells. compared to control (pcdna3),  xxxg1772xxx -dn and  xxxg1773xxx -dn
both reduced the number of syncytium by ⬃50% (fig.
3, p⬍0.05). conversely, the expression of wild-type
 xxxg1773xxx  ( xxxg1773xxx -wt) greatly boosted ltr activation, and
the expression of wild-type  xxxg1772xxx  ( xxxg1772xxx -wt) provided a
weak potentiation effect (p⬍0.05). to further determine whether plds selectively regulate the fusion
process and/or ltr activation, we next used a cell
fusion assay that does not rely on reporter gene activity,
as described (33). using facs monitoring of fluores-

or wild-type ha- xxxg1773xxx  ( xxxg1773xxx -wt) or ha- xxxg1772xxx  ( xxxg1772xxx -wt).

cent dye transfer from fusing cells, we saw no significant
differences in the presence of pld variants in this assay
(data not shown). consequently, we investigated
whether gene expression from the ltr could be upregulated by plds.
the contribution of pld isoforms to ltr activation
was studied using hela p4.2 cells after cotransfection
with tat and the pld variant-coding vectors or an
empty vector. the activation of the hiv-1 ltr required
tat and was proportional to the amount of tat dna
from 0.1 to 0.5 ␮g (fig. 4a). the expression of inactive

plds greatly inhibited the ltr response,
reaching ⬃70% inhibition for both pld variants (fig.
4b). conversely, the expression of wild-type  xxxg1772xxx  or
 xxxg1773xxx  induced a great potentiation of the ltr response, and the degree of potentiation was similar for
both plds (fig. 4c). since the activation of the ltr
response was proportional to the amount of tat (fig.
4a), tat expression was examined in cells transfected
with the pld variants. immunoblot analysis of cellular
extracts showed no significant alteration in the amount
of tat after expression of pld variants (fig. 4d).
since pld activity appears to play an important role
in regulating the ltr response, we wondered whether
the activation of chemoattractant receptors such as
ccr5 or the formyl peptide receptor fpr promotes the
ltr response. to this end, hela p4.2 cells were
cotransfected with tat and either ccr5 or fpr. stimulation of both receptors induced a significant potentiation of ltr activation compared to control (fig. 5a).
this effect was inhibited in the presence of the mek
antagonist  xxxd3462xxx , suggesting a positive regulation by
the erk pathway. consistent with this, the expression
of a constitutively activated mekk mutant (mek-dd)
markedly potentiated the transactivation of ltr (fig.
5b).

variants progressively vanished, likely due in part to cell
proliferation. to further examine the relevance of this
observation in a more physiological cellular model,
virus replication was studied in the monocytic cell line
thp-1 (39). our data confirm that this cellular model
is appropriate to replication of hiv-1bal (fig. 6c).
since these cells are hardly transfectable with plasmid
vectors encoding the pld mutants under classical
conditions, the contribution of pld was studied after
transfection of cells with the antisense oligonucleotides
to  xxxg1772xxx  or  xxxg1773xxx  we used earlier in hl-60 cells (26).
treatment of thp-1 cells with 8 ␮m antisense oligonucleotides inhibited the expression of both pld by
⬃50 – 60% (fig. 6d). compared to control cells trans-

contribution of plds to hiv-1 replication
activation of hiv-1 ltr by tat is an essential step to
virus replication (7, 8, 10). since pld activity strongly
regulates the ltr response, we studied the contribution of pld isoforms to replication of hiv-1 in magi
cells constitutively expressing ccr5 and cd4. incubation of magi cells with hiv-1-bal led to a significant
time-dependent production of hiv-1, as described
(38). the transient expression of inactive pld variants
(fig. 6b) partly but significantly inhibited the production of hiv-1 gag p24 determined at 24 h of infection
(fig. 6a). conversely, the expression of wild-type  xxxg1772xxx 
or  xxxg1773xxx  boosted ltr activation. for longer periods of

the production of gag p24 after cell infection (fig. 6c),
which confirms the important role for both plds in
hiv-1 replication parameters (fig. 4).
the efficiency of leukocyte infection with r5-hiv
strains depends in part on the signaling initiated by
trimeric g-proteins of gi type (16), although this
assumption has been a subject of controversy. we
therefore examined the contribution of gi in producing gag p24 by hiv-1bal-infected thp-1 cells. treating
cells with the g␣i inhibitor pertussis toxin (100 and 300
ng/ml) significantly reduced the production of gag
p24 after 3 days of infection (fig. 7a) without altering
cell viability (fig. 7b). however, the ptx inhibitory
effect was partial (40%), in agreement with the literature (16), and was not further increased with a higher
toxin concentration (300 ng/ml).

discussion
this study provides the first evidence that ccr5 activation by mip-1␤ triggers substantial pld activity (200300 p mol choline/107 magi cells) in a rapid, transient, and  xxxg1369xxx /2-dependent pattern similar to that of
the formyl peptide receptor fpr in hek and hl-60
cells (26). we also showed that hiv-1 enveloped glycoprotein gp120 also stimulated strong pld activity that
was partially dependent on erk. both  xxxg1772xxx  and  xxxg1773xxx 
contribute to ccr5-mediated pld activity, as shown by
the expression of inactive pld mutants and the use of
sirna oligos. the mechanism by which  xxxg1369xxx /2 regulates the pld activity was not studied in detail here
since we previously showed that activated erk phosphorylates the  xxxg1773xxx  isoform and stimulates pld activity in membrane preparations in the presence of atp
(26). we also showed that the  xxxg1773xxx  isoform forms a
complex with  xxxg1369xxx /2 in resting hek cells and is
phosphorylated on map kinases consensus (s/t-p)

upon stimulation of fpr. it remains unknown whether
 xxxg1772xxx  can be activated by map kinases, although its
sequence contains potential phosphorylation sites.
the biochemical process by which activated ccr5 or
fpr triggers the erk/ xxxg1773xxx  pathway is not elucidated.
however, pkc, a potent activator of erk and pld (26)
that can be activated upon stimulation of ccr5 (40) or
fpr (41), does not appear to play a major role, as we
noted that the pkc antagonist  xxxd2195xxx  did not alter
the pld activity mediated by fpr (26) or ccr5 (data
not shown). a similar observation was reported for the
norepinephrine-stimulated pld activity in vascular
smooth muscle cells (42). an interesting hypothesis is
that ccr5 or fpr-mediated pld activity may occur
through early recruitment of the raf- xxxg1361xxx /2- xxxg1369xxx /2
module at the plasma membranes after the binding of
␤-arrestins to activated ccr5 or fpr. this is suggested
by the observation that ␤-arrestin 2 is a scaffolding
protein of the  xxxg1369xxx /2 module and stimulates its
activation (43). consistent with this, we reported that
fpr stimulation in hek cells increases the amount of
 xxxg1369xxx /2 immunoprecipitated with  xxxg1773xxx  and the  xxxg1773xxx 
phosphorylation by map kinases (26). the erk/pld
pathway thus may be stimulated independent of pkc,
presumably through the downstream effectors of heterotrimeric g-proteins such as gi. among these, the
small g-protein ras can be directly activated by the ␤␥
complex of gi and by lipids generated by  xxxg1743xxx -kinase-␥;
the latter is also activated by the ␤␥ subunit of gi (24).
the importance of gi in ccr5 signaling and in
hiv-1 infection upon r5-virion binding to ccr5 has
recently been reported in hos cells using the gi
inhibitor ptx and a ccr5 mutant that does not
activate gi (16). we confirmed here that ptx significantly reduced the production of gag p24 by thp-1
cells. the inhibition was observed 3 days after infection
but not for shorter periods (24 – 48 h), consistent with
the notion that ccr5 signaling through the gi protein
up-regulates hiv-1 postentry events (34, 15) but not
hiv entry (44). however, the ptx inhibitory did not
exceed 40% only, which indicates that gi-independent
signaling pathways may be important. also, ptx-insensitive g-proteins like gq should not be excluded since
they interact with chemokine receptors (45), including
ccr5 (46).
this study shows that the catalytic activity of  xxxg1772xxx 
and  xxxg1773xxx  plays a major role in regulating hiv-1
infection parameters. this is supported by the fact that
the expression of inactive or wild-type plds respectively
inhibited and boosted the ltr response (fig. 4) together with the hiv-1 replication in magi cells (fig.
6a). in addition, the inhibition of expression of both
plds by antisense oligonucleotides drastically inhibited
hiv-1 replication in thp-1 cells. pld is a main source
of lipid second messengers, such as phosphatidic acid
(pa), a potent activator of pkc␨, and diglycerides,
which activate other pkcs. our observation that the
pkc antagonist  xxxd2195xxx  strongly inhibited the ltr
activation by tat (⬃80%; data not shown) agrees with
previous work (12–14) and is consistent with a main
4044

contribution by the pld pathway. a role for pa in
regulating the ltr response has also been proposed
(47). our observation that the stimulation of ccr5 by
mip-1␤ or fpr by fmlp further increased the ltr
activation through an  xxxg1369xxx /2-dependent process (fig.
5) raises the possibility that hiv-1 postentry events can
be regulated not only by ccr5 (34, 15), but also by
other membrane receptors that stimulate  xxxg1369xxx /2 or
pld. the fpr is of particular interest since it can be
activated by hiv-1-derived peptides (27) and by the
hiv-1 transactivator tat (48), suggesting a potential
role for fpr in the amplification of viral infection.
pathways linking pld activity to regulation of the
transcriptional activation of ltr and viral replication
are not elucidated. our data suggest pld preferentially
regulates host-cell transcription factors that bind to the
ltr sequence used here (⫺138 to ⫹83) rather than
the viral protein tat.
activation of ltr by tat is essential for hiv-1
replication (7, 8, 10). tat is expressed in the early steps
of viral replication and interacts with the transactivation response element (tar), allowing recruitment of
cyclin t1 and  xxxg417xxx , which phosphorylates the ctd of
rna pol ii. tat also induces nuclear translocation of
erk/12,which may lead to gene expression (49). in
addition, tat is secreted by infected cells and extracellular tat stimulates various intracellular signaling
events (48),which may promote gene expression. in
this study, the expression of pld variants did not alter
the expression of tat (fig. 4c). this is consistent with
an earlier observation that the pkc depletion in jurkat
and 293 cells did not alter the synthesis of tat whereas
ltr activation was strongly inhibited (13). however,
regulation of the ltr response by pkc does not appear
to involve phosphorylation of tat or the phorbol esterresponsive enhancers of ltr that mediate basal transcription by mitogens (13). among host cell transcription factors of the ltr (reviewed in ref. 50), nf-␬b was
up-regulated by pld (51). however, both plds repressed the level of p21 by different mechanisms:  xxxg1772xxx 
by repressing p53 and  xxxg1773xxx  by down-regulating the
activity of sp1 (52). the ltr response is also upregulated by reactive oxygen species (ros) (14), activators of map kinases and nf-␬b (24). note also that
ros production by stimulated phagocytes correlates
with pld activity (53, 26). our data suggest that the
pld activity is important in hiv-1 replication as a
potential target to lower the state of cellular activation,
and consequently the hiv-1 ltr response and viral
replication (figs. 4, 6). in addition, our observation
that  xxxg1773xxx  is finely regulated by erk via phosphorylation of only a few sites (2 phosphopeptides vs. 12 for
pkc␣) (26) makes it possible to identify structural
motifs that could serve as templates to design pld
antagonists. one advantage of targeting the selective
erk/pld coupling is that it would preserve basal pld
activation (fig. 1c) and would selectively inhibit the
priming properties of pld activity mediated by various
agonists at the origin of numerous cell dysfunctions.
in conclusion, this study shows that activation of

the faseb journal

paruch et al

ccr5 mediates a substantial pld activity through the
activation of  xxxg1369xxx /2. both  xxxg1772xxx  and  xxxg1773xxx  contribute
to this stimulation and make an essential contribution
to the transactivation of hiv-1 ltr by tat and to hiv
replication. since the pld signaling pathway can be
stimulated by various membrane receptors that promote hiv-1 ltr activation, pld activity and erk/pld
coupling open pharmacological perspectives to the
design of potential pld antagonists that could inhibit
the state of cellular activation and the progression of
hiv infection.
