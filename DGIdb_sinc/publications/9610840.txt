sesamin (a non-fat portion of sesame seed oil) inhibits a-5 desaturase activity resulting in an
accumulation of dihomo~-iinolenic acid ( xxxd1886xxx ) which can displace  xxxd208xxx  (aa) and decrease the formation
of pro-inflammatory mediators. we investigated the effects of consumption of diets containing 0.25wt% sesamin and
15 wt% safflower oil (so) (providing 12% of the added fat as linoleic acid) or a 15 wt% 2:1 mixture of linseed oil and
so (loso) (providing 6% ~-iinolenic acid and 6% linoleic acid) for 3 weeks on the liver membrane fatty acid
composition and on the production of prostaglandin (pg) e2, tnf-~, il-6 and ill0 in mice. consumption of sesaminsupplemented so and loso diets resulted in a significant increase in the levels of 20:3(o6 ( xxxd1886xxx ), suggesting that
sesamin inhibited a-5 desaturation of o)6  xxxd2154xxx . in animals fed loso diets, the levels of a- xxxd2490xxx ,
 xxxd2318xxx  (epa) and of docosahexaenoic acid (dha) were elevated with a concomitant decrease of
 xxxd208xxx  (ha) in the liver membrane phospholipids. further, in animals fed loso diets with or without
sesamin, an increase in the circulating levels of  xxxg2296xxx  was associated with a concomitant decrease in pge2. despite
a lack of differences in the levels of aa, the pge2 levels were significantly lower in mice fed sesamin-supplemented
so compared to those fed so alone. thus, these data suggest that irrespective of the availability of a specific fatty
acid as a substrate, through regulating the pge2 synthesis, the production of tnf-ct could be modulated.
summary

introduction

linoleic acid (la: 18:2o)6) is the precursor for the formation of  xxxd208xxx  (aa) which is metabolized to
proinflammatory mediators such as prostaglandins
(pge2). other polyunsaturated  xxxd2154xxx  (pufa) such as
a- xxxd2490xxx  (18:3¢o3) and ?- xxxd2490xxx  (18:3¢~6) are
precursors for the formation of  xxxd2318xxx 
(epa: 20:5t03) and dihomo-y- xxxd2490xxx  ( xxxd1886xxx : 20:3(o6),
respectively, both of which besides forming less inflammatory mediators, can also displace aa (20:40~6) and
reduce the production of pge2. thus, dietary fats rich in
?- xxxd2490xxx , u- xxxd2490xxx , or epa have been emreceived 30 june 1997

ployed to modulate some of the inflammatory responses
in experimental animals models 1,2and in clinical trials. 3-5
sesamin and other related lignans present in the nonfat portion (1-2 wt%) of sesame seed off6,7 enhance
hepatic detoxification of chemicals, reduces the incidence
of chemically induced mammary tumors and protects
against oxidative stress. 6-s data arising from our laboratory, 9 as well as from other investigators suggest that
sesamin inhibits a-5-desaturase activity for o)6 pufa, and
results in an accumulation of  xxxd1886xxx  with a concomitant
decrease of aaj °'h but sesamin has also been reported to
enhance a-5 desaturation of o)3  xxxd2154xxx  in rats fed an
experimental diet containing a mixture of perilla off and
safflower off which provided la and ~-lna at a ratio of
1:2. ~ because it has been known that the  xxxg2014xxx  and elongase enzymes favor mainly the o)3 pufa,
providing relatively higher amounts of the precursor, etlna, in the diet used in these experiments is expected to
185

186

chavali et al

result in an increase in the formation of h-5 desaturated
0)3  xxxd2154xxx . thus, the conclusions drawn from these
data could be misleading. to assess the differential ability
of sesamin to inhibit z~-5desaturation for o~6 and co3 fatty
acids, it is a better choice to feed the animals a wellcontrolled diet containing equal amounts of la and ~lna. in the present investigations, mice were fed diets
containing safflower oil (so) providing 12% pufa as la
alone or a diet containing 2:1 mixture of linseed oil (lo)
and so (loso) providing 6% c~-lnaand 6% la, and the
effects of supplementing 0.25% sesamin on membrane
fatty acid composition, and on the production of pge2,
tnf-c~, il-6 and il-10 in response to an i.p. injection of
endotoxin were determined.
materials

and methods

animals

six-eight-week-old, inbred, female balb/c mice (charles
river laboratories) were maintained in an approved animal
facility with a 12 h day and 12 h night cycle. they were
allowed free access to drinking water and the experimental diets were fed daily at dusk.
diets

both safflower oil and linseed oil were obtained from
novarfis nutrition (st louis park, mn, usa). all
the diets contained 15 wt% (30% kcal) of safflower oil
providing 12% la or 15wt% of a physical mixture of
safflower oil and linseed oil (1:2 wt/wt) providing 6%
a- xxxd2490xxx  and 6% linoleic acid. the fatty acid
composition of so- and loso-enriched diets is shown in
table 1. fats were mixed with ain-76a fat-free powder
along with 0.050/0 t-butylhydroxyquinone toluene as an
antioxidant, partitioned into daily rations packaged in
separate whirl-pack bags, flushed with n2, and stored at

each of the diets contained 15 wt% safflower oil (so) or a 2:1
mixture of linseed oil and safflower oil (loso) mixed in ain-76a
fat-free powder. the fatty acid compositions of diets
supplemented with sesamin were similar to those without.
abbreviations: u.d. = undetectable. numbers in the parentheses
indicate the percentage of individual  xxxd2154xxx  in the total amount
of 15wt% added fat.

4°c. where mentioned, these diets were supplemented
with 0.25% sesamin (suntory ltd osaka, japan).
fatty acid analysis

liver tissues were homogenized and extracted with
chloroform:methanol (2:1 v/v) solvent mixture containing
0.01%  xxxd398xxx  as an antioxidant. the
chloroform fractions were evaporated to dryness under
n2 and reconstituted in the same solvent. the total phospholipids were separated by thin-layer chromatography
on silica gel-h plates (analtech inc. newark, de, usa),
and the fatty acid methyl esters were derived 12 and analyzed on a fused-silica capillary column (100 m, 0.25 mm
id, 0.20 i~m thickness; sptm-2560, supelco inc., bellefonte,
pa, usa) using a gas chromatograph (5890 series ii)
equipped with a mass selective detector (5971, hewlettpackard). the resuks were expressed as relative percentage of identified  xxxd2154xxx  on a molar basis, using
heptadecaenoic acid (17:0) as an intemal standard.
endotoxin-induced in vivo production of cytokines

a lethal dose (ld50/24h = 20 mg/kg) of lipopolysaccharide (lps:b55:05, dffco labs, mi, usa) was injected
intraperitoneally, and after 90m in, or 9h, the blood
samples were collected from the inferior vena cava using
syringes rinsed with heparin. this protocol has been
approved by the animal care and use committee at the
beth israel deaconess medical center. the plasma levels
of tnt-a, il-6, and il-10 were determined according to
the manufacturer's instructions using enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assay kits (biosource international,
camarillo, ca, usa).
radioimmunoassays for prostaglandin (pg)e

an aliquot of 50 111 plasma (in 1 ml pbs) was extracted
twice with 2 ml ethyl acetate, and the solvent fractions
were pooled and evaporated to dryness under n2. the
resultant extract was resuspended in pbs containing
0.1% gelatin, and the levels of pge2 were determined
in a radioimmunoassay according to the procedures
described elsewhere. 13 the polyclonal rabbit anti-pge2
was purchased from perseptive diagnostics (cambridge,
m_a,usa). according to the supplier's technical information, the pge2 antiserum has a 50% cross-reactivity with
 xxxd124xxx , and no data were available for its cross-reactivity
with pge3. we determined that 1230 pg/ml of pge2 or
120pg/ml of pge2 or a mixture containing loopg/ml
each of pge2 and pge3 was required to achieve 50% binding with anti pge2 antiserum and thus may have a 10%
cross-reactivity with pge3. therefore, the actual amounts
of pge2 reported may represent up to a maximum of 50%

as  xxxd124xxx  and of 10% pge3 if present in our samples. no
effort was made to correct for cross-reactivity with pgez,
and pge3 which are expected in samples from mice fed
diets supplemented with sesamin and those with linseed
oil, respectively. no such cross-reactivity is expected to
affect the pge2 values in so-fed mice.
statistical analysis

the significance (p<0.05) in differences in the mean
concentrations of cytokines, eicosanoids and  xxxd2154xxx 
was determined using a student's t-test.

effects on the m e m b r a n e fatty acid composition

the changes in the fatty acid composition (mean + sd;
mol.% ) resulting from the a-5 desaturase inhibitory activity of sesamin,]°,h were determined in the liver membrane
phospholipids from mice fed the so or loso diets for
4-14 days. the amounts of saturated, monounsaturated
 xxxd2154xxx  and linoleic acid did not differ between the
groups. the levels of 20:3(06 ( xxxd1886xxx ) were significantly
higher (p< 0.05) in mice fed sesamin-supplemented so
diets (so = 1.6 _+ 0.2 vs 50 = 1.2 + 0.1) or loso diet
(loso+ = 1.8 + 0.1 vs loso -- 1.4 + 0.1) on day 14. the
ratio of amdgla (a-5 desaturation index for (06 fatty

187

acids) was markedly lower (p< 0.05) in mice fed sesaminsupplemented so diets (so+ = 16.0+ 1.5 vs so =
23.7 + 1.8) or loso diets (loso+ = 3.8 + 0.3 vs loso =
5.2 + 0.5). the tissue levels of epa did not differ markedly between the groups of mice fed sesamin-supplemented
loso diets (9.9 + 1.0) and those maintained on loso
diets (10.4 + 0.4), but the levels of c~-lnawere significantly lower in the former (1.2 + 0.3) compared to the latter
(1.7 + 0.03). the ratio of 20:5(03/18:3(03 (a-5 desaturation
index for (03  xxxd2154xxx ) was markedly higher (v< 0.05)
in mice fed loso diet supplemented with sesamin
(8.7 + 1.4) compared to those fed loso alone (6.2 + 0.5).
the concentrations of aa in the groups of animals
fed so or loso diets, respectively, did not differ in the
presence or absence of sesamin. however, after 14 days of
feeding sesamin-supplemented so diet, the tissue levels
of dha (5.3 + 1.0) were significantly lower (p< 0.05) compared to those maintained on so alone (7.0+0.4).
further, compared to the so groups, in animals fed loso,
the increase in the amount of (03 pufa was almost 2-fold
on day 4, and almost 4-fold on day 14, while the (06 pufa
declined by nearly 50%. further, in animals fed sesaminsupplemented loso diets for 14 days, the levels of aa
declined in these animals with a comparable increase in
the amount of epa. similarly, a decrease in dha was associated with an increase in the amount of docosatetraenoic
acid (22:4(06) in so-fed animals (table 2).

the formation of epa, the a-5 desaturase product.

diets (6.2 + 0.5). these data suggest that the a-5 desaturase activity for o3 pufa was significantly enhanced in
mice consuming sesamin-supplemented loso diet, and
these observations are consistent with the data reported
elsewhere in rats fed perilla oil (another source of ct-lna)
and sesaminy these data are explained if sesamin inhibited the activity of a specific a-5 desaturase enzyme for
o)6 pufa, while enhancing the activity of that specific for
o)3 pufa. thus, these data confirm the assertion that o3
pufa are preferentially converted to their respective a-5
desaturation products compared to (o6 pufa.
an increase in the tissue levels of docosatetraenoic acid
(22:4o)6) in animals fed so diets for 14 days (and not in
those fed for only 4 days) was associated with a decrease
in the concentrations of dha. likewise, in animals fed
loso diets for at least 14 days, the levels of aa decreased
significantly with a comparable increase in epa. these

data (table 2) suggest that the length of consumption of
a particular diet could influence biological responses.
in mice fed the sesamin-supplemented so diet a
decrease in the plasma levels of pgei+2 (fig. 1) was associated with an increase of  xxxd1886xxx  (table 2). consistent with
the effects of feeding 0)3 pufa diets, 21-23a marked reduction in the circulating levels of pgei÷2 (fig. 1) in mice consuming ct-lna containing loso diets was associated with
a decrease in the tissue levels of aa with a concomitant
increase of epa (table 2). both  xxxd1886xxx  and epa can displace aa, compete with it in binding to cyclooxygenase
and, consequently, reduce the formation of proinflammatory dienoic eicosanoids and also increase the formation
of less inflammatory 1- and 3-series pgs, respectively.5,14,1s
the observation that the plasma levels of pgei÷2 were
markedly lower in mice fed sesamin-supplemented so
diets, despite a lack of differences in the tissue levels of
aa (table 2), suggests that sesamin could inhibit the
enzymic activity of cyclooxygenase, which is responsible
for the formation of eicosanoids?
exogenous addition of pge2 results in a significant
reduction in the secretion of lps-induced  xxxg2296xxx  24,2s
which is regulated through pka pathway. 26,27further, the
production of pge2 is associated with a marked decrease
of tnf-ct secretion in macrophages stimulated with lps.
on the other hand, addition of indomethacin, a prostaglandin synthesis inhibitor, enhances the production of
zn~-ct. 2s'29 thus, a decrease in the secretion of pge2
(fig. 1) could enhance the circulating levels of  xxxg2296xxx 
(fig. 2) in mice consuming loso. similarly, the production of  xxxg2296xxx  is also markedly higher in peritoneal resident
macrophages from mice fed (o3 pufa diets compared to
those fed m6 pufa diets, a°,amin contrast, the lps-induced
secretion of  xxxg2296xxx  is significantly lower in the peripheral
blood mononuclear cells (pbmc) from volunteers taking
fish oil dietary supplements compared to their basal
levels.32,33 in these instances, the ability of la and oleic
acid, common constituents of foods, to modulate, the
production of  xxxg2296xxx  could, in part, explain the discrepancies from the data obtained in mice. the relative homogeneity of macrophages derived from the peritoneum as
opposed to a proportionately fewer number of macrophage-monocytes which are at a different stage of maturation in the human pbmc may also explain the
differences in the in vitro production of tnf-ct between
the two species. further, the ability of dietary  xxxd2154xxx 
to differentially modulate pka and pkc pathways 34 both
of which are involved in the regulation of the production
of tnf<t could also explain the observed discrepancies.
a decrease in the secretion of il-6 and il- 10 in mice fed
a-lna diets (figs 3, 4) could further the understanding
the mechanisms by which consumption of diets supplemented with certain precursor  xxxd2154xxx  influence
immune responses, a°-34 endogenous il-10 and il-6 exhi-

bit several pleotropic effects including differentiation of
both t and b cells. 35-a7the release of il-6 is enhanced in
the presence of aa along with its metabolites such as
ltb4,3s pgs. 39an increase in the levels of pge2 (fig. 1) and
of aa in the tissues could cause an enhancement in the
circulating levels of il-6 (fig. 3) in mice consuming so
diets. conversely, a decrease in aa together with a
decline in the levels of dienoic eicosanoids (fig. 1) would
explain a marked reduction in the levels of il-6 in animals
fed loso diets (fig. 3). further, endotoxin-induced lethality is increased in il-10 deficient mice, 4° and in those passively immunized with anti il-10 antiserum. 4' based on
these data, it is plausible to suggest that a decrease in the
circulating levels of il-6 and il-10 (fig. 4) may compromise the ability of the host to defend against infection
and inflammation as a result of consumption of o)3 pufa
diets.
in summary, these data suggest that consumption of
diets supplemented with sesamin resulted in an inhibition
of the a-5 desaturase activity of o)6 pufa. further, irrespective of the type of dietary fat consumed, an increase
in tnf-~ in the circulation is associated with a decrease
in the levels of pge2. moreover, the plasma levels of
both il-6 and of il-10 were markedly lower in mice fed
a- xxxd2490xxx  diets.
