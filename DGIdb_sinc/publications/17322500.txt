is the effect of testosterone on body composition modulated by the  xxxg183xxx  gene cag repeat polymorphism in elderly men?  the  xxxg183xxx  (ar) gene contains a cag repeat polymorphism coding for a  xxxd2212xxx  chain, the length of which is inversely correlated with ar transcriptional activity. we explored whether this polymorphism modulates the activities of testosterone (t) related to body composition in elderly men.
