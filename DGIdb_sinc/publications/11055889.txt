new therapeutic options in deep vein
thrombosis prophylaxis
b. i. eriksson
joint replacement
surgery is complicated
by a high rate of postoperative
venous thromboembolism
(vte).
current thromboprophylactic
approaches reduce the rate of vte, but the incidence remains as high as 20% to
50%. recombinant
hirudins, such as desirudin and  xxxd2455xxx , function by directly inhibiting thrombin, and are
a new development in antithrombotic
therapy. in two multicenter
studies, desirudin was found to be superior
to unfractionated
heparin (ufh) in the prevention of deep vein thrombosis (dvt) after total hip alloplasty. a
further trial of more than 2,000 patients undergoing
elective hip replacement
compared the thromboprophylactic efficacy of desirudin versus the low-molecular-weight
heparin (lmwh) enoxaparin.
desirudin was more
effective than lmwh in providing effective prophylaxis, and maintained superiority in patients with additional
risk. desirudin was shown to be equally safe and did not requlre laboratory monitoring. desirudin (15 mg twice
daily) is an efficient therapy for dvt prevention in hip alloplasty patients at additional risk.

d

eep vein thrombosis
(dvt) is a
common complication of joint replacement surgery, and can lead to pulmonary embolism (pe) and long-term post-thrombotic
syndrome. orthopedic surgery has a higher risk
of venous thromboembolism (vie) than general surgery, and emergency procedures, such as
surgery for hip fracture, carry a high risk of fatal
pe. reported rates of fatal pe ranged from 3%
to 6% after total hip replacement and 4% to
13 % after hip fracture. 1 it is clear that low-dose
unfractionated heparin (ufh) reduces the incidence of vte in orthopedic patients, but the
incidence remains greater than 20%.2 a large
study comparing prophylactic treatment with
low-molecular-weight
heparin (lmwh)
and
warfarin in patients undergoing hip or knee
replacement found a risk reduction of 16% with
lmwh, but the incidence of dvt remained
greater than 30%.6
despite effective prophylaxis, there is still a
need for improved protection in patients undergoing high-risk procedures with additional risk
factors. new agents under investigation include
the heparinoids, pentasaccharides, and oral
thrombin inhibitors. one of the most highly
investigated new compounds is recombinant
hirudin. hirudin is a naturally occurring selective thrombin inhibitor.
two recombinant
hirudins,  xxxd2455xxx  and desirudin, have been
developed. these novel antithrombotics inhibit
both free-circulating and clot-bound thrombin
seminars in hematology,

and function independently of antithrombin
iii. desirudin (revas@, aventis, paris, france)
is approved in the european union (eu) as
prophylaxis
in hip and knee alloplasty
and offers improved thromboprophylaxis
for
patients undergoing high-risk surgical procedures.  xxxd2455xxx , which is still under investigation, is currently approved for heparininduced thrombocytopenia
and submissions
have been filed in the eu and the united states
for its use in the treatment of patients with
unstable angina and noncomplete myocardial
infarction. another hirudin analog,  xxxd348xxx 
(hirulog), is being developed for use in the
prevention of dvt following surgery.

early studies of recombinant
hirudin
desirudin, a recombinant form of hirudin, was
proven to be an efficient anticoagulant in experimental models. the first pilot trial3 of
desirudin was undertaken in patients undergoing elective hip replacement, using a subcutafrom the department

neous twice-daily dosing schedule. dosesof 10,
15, and 20 mg twice daily appeared to be safe,
but patients receiving 40 mg twice daily experienced major hemorrhage. this higher dosage
was therefore discontinued. following the identification of safe dosing regimens, a larger trial
was undertaken and included more than 200
patients at each dose level.* patients undergoing elecrive hip replacement were randomized
to treatment with desirudin (10, 15, or 20 mg
subcutaneously twice daily) or ufh (so00 iu
three times daily}. desirudin was given after
anesthesia and before the surgical incision. the
time to maximum plasma concentration of
desirudin is approximately 30 minutes, which
allows efficient anticoagulation during the operation while avoiding the potential dangers of
increased susceptibility to hemorrhage during
the administration of spinal or epidural anesthetic. all patients underwent postoperative
venography before the end of the trleatment
period at 8 to 11 days.
the results of this study are shown in table
1. the incidence of rota1 dvt in patients
treated with desirudin ranged from 17% to
24% (depending on the dose received), compared with 34% in patients receiving ufh. for
proximal dvt, the incidence ranged from 2%
to 8% with desirudin, compared with 19% for
ufh. the clinical efficacy of the different
dosagesof desirudin was reflected in the plasma
concentrations of desirudin and the change in
activated partial thromboplastin
time after
treatment (table 2). overall efficacy with respect to the prevention of both proximal and
total dvt was similar for the 15- and 20-mg
dosage regimens. to reduce the likelihood of
bleeding complications, the lower dose of 15
mg twice daily was selected for subsequent
trials.

desirwdin versus lmwh in
elective total hip replacement
a double-blind trial comparing desirudin with
the lmwh enoxaparin ( xxxd1997xxx */lovenox@,
aventis), enrolled more than 2,000 patients
undergoing elective total hip replacement and
from 10 european countries.5 patients were
randomized to treatment with either desirudin
(15 mg subcutaneously twice daily) starting
immediately before operation, or enoxaparin
(40 mg subcutaneously once daily) starting the
evening before operation. both drugs were
continued for 8 to 12 days, and placebo injections maintained blinding.
all patients underwent mandatory bilateral
venography at the end of the treatment period
or earlier if symptoms suggestive of vte developed. the rabinov and paulin technique8
(with minor modifications) was used for venography, and all venograms were read at a central
location by one of two assessors.trial radiologists underwent training to minimize the number of inadequate venograms. patients in whom
an adequate venogram could not be obtained
were excluded from the analysis.
the incidence of dvt (both proximal and
total) was lower in the patients treated with
desirudin than in the patients treated with
lmwh (table 3). blood loss and the need for
transfusion were similar in the two groups.

potential cost-effectiveness
of
desirudin versus heparin
in a recent study,â€™ a simulation model based on
both epidemiologic and clinical trial data was
used to compare the cost-effectiveness of prophylaxis with ufh with that of desirudin in
patients undergoing elective hip replacement.
the study showed that desirudin prophylaxis
saved 4.5 life-years per 100 patients treated,
and prophylaxis was more cost-effective and
potentially cost-saving compared with ufh
when certain assumptions concerning the future
price of desirudin were considered.

the clinical trial program for desirudin has now
enrolled more than 3,600 patients undergoing
total hip alloplasty. the results show that the
specific inhibition of thrombin is effective in
the prevention of postoperative vte. desirudin
offered greater efficacy than ufh and lmwh,
without the need for laboratory monitoring,
and had a similar safety profile.
