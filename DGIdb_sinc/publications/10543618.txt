l -dopa: engraftment in a rat model of parkinson disease
emily j. schwarz,1 guillermo m. alexander, 2 darwin j. prockop,1 and s. ausim azizi 2

abstract
bone marrow stromal cells can be used as an alternative source of cells for neural transplantation and repair. here, the efficacy of genetically modified marrow stromal cells was examined in a rat model of parkinson disease. rat marrow stromal cells (rmscs) and human marrow stromal cells (hmscs) were genetically
engineered by transduction with retroviruses encoding  xxxg2276xxx  (th) and  xxxg875xxx ,
the enzyme necessary for production of the  xxxd3166xxx  cofactor for th (bh 4 ). transduced cells synthesized 3,4-dihydrox yphenylalani ne (l -dopa) in vitro and maintained their multipotentiality after retroviral transduction. to examine the cells in vivo, transduced rmscs were injected into the striatum of 6-hydroxydopam ine-lesioned rats. l -dopa and metabolites were detected by microdialysis in the denervated
striatum of rats that received doubly transduced rmscs. also, there was a significant reduction in apom orphine-induced rotation when compared with controls. the cells engrafted and survived for at least 87 days.
however, expression of the transgenes ceased at about 9 days, an observation consistent with reports from
other laboratories in which similar retroviruses were used to express transgenes in the brain.

overview summary
rat marrow stromal cells and human marrow stromal cells
were genetically engineered to synthesize l -dopa by transducing the cells with retroviruses encoding tyrosine
hydroxylase and/or gtp cyclohydrolas e i, the enzyme necessary for synthesis of a critical cofactor for  xxxg2276xxx . the transduced cells synthesized l -dopa in vitro
and maintained their multipotentiali ty after retroviral
transduction . after injection of the transduced rat marrow
strom al cells in the striatum of 6-hydroxyd opamine-lesi oned
rats, l -dopa and metabolites were detected by microdialysis. also, there was a significant reduction in apomorphineinduced rotation. the engrafted cells survived at least 87
days, but expression of the transgene ceased after about 9
days, an observation consistent with previous reports in
which sim ilar retroviruses were used to expression transgenes in the brain.

introduction

p

(pd) is a devastating neurodegenerative
illness affecting up to 1% of individuals over age 60 years.
a r k in s o n d is ea s e

the disease is characterized by a loss of dopaminergic neurons
in the substantia nigra and clinical symptoms that include
bradykinesia, tremor at rest, and cogwheel rigidity. although
pd is progressive, patients usually have a norm al life span. the
mainstay of therapy for pd is oral administration of 3,4-dihydroxy- l -phenylalanine ( l -dopa). a number of patients initially respond to l -dopa therapy but the response decreases
with time. the likely reasons for this loss of efficacy are loss
of storage capacity and fluctuations in transport of l -dopa
from the gut to the brain. the pulsatile administration of
dopaminergic drugs causes widely fluctuating concentrations of
dopamine in the vicinity of  xxxd2243xxx  ine receptors and changes the
receptor kinetics. as a result, many patients experience periods
of immobility alternating with periods of near-normal movement. several studies suggest that therapy with l -dopa can be
improved by achieving continuous levels of l -dopa within the
cns with repeated small doses (chase et al., 1989, 1993; schuh
and bennett, 1993; obeso et al., 1994). to provide a more stable source of dopamine, a series of patients with pd received
transplants of mesencephalic cells from human fetuses (bjorklund, 1993; olson, 1997), and a number of patients had significant improvement in clinical symptoms (see hauser et al.,
1999).
several strategies for in vivo and ex vivo therapy have been

used to replace  xxxd2243xxx  ine in the striatum of patients and in animal models of pd. the in vivo strategies have included direct
transfer of genes encoding for enzym es needed to synthesize l dopa and dopamine, such as  xxxg2276xxx  (th), the
rate-limiting enzyme in  xxxd2243xxx  ine synthesis, and aromatic
amino acid decarboxylase ( xxxg618xxx ), the enzyme that converts
l -dopa to dopamine. an adeno-associated virus (aav) containing both the genes for th and  xxxg618xxx  was injected into the
striatum of a monkey model for pd (during et al., 1998); and
separate aavs encoding th and/or  xxxg618xxx  were used in a rat
model of pd (fan et al., 1998). in a related strategy, separate
aavs encoding th and  xxxg875xxx  (gc), the enzym e necessary for synthesis of the tetrahydrobiopter in (bh 4 )
cofactor for th, were injected into denervated rat striatum
(mandel et al., 1998). in experiments in which assays by microdialysis were performed, there was increased synthesis of l dopa and metabolites. the effects on induced rotation were
more variable.
the alternative strategy of ex vivo gene therapy for pd has
the advantage that manipulations of cells can be performed prior
to transplantation. however, the donor cells must fulfill several
criteria: (1) the cells must be easily obtained, (2) survive for
long periods of time in vivo, (3) efficiently express the transgenes, and (4) not elicit host immune reactions. a variety of
donor cells were studied in neural transplantation experiments,
including fibroblasts (kang et al., 1993; bencsics et al., 1996;
wachtel et al., 1997), schwann cells (brook et al., 1994), astrocytes (lundberg et al., 1996; ljungberg et al., 1999), adrenal
medullary cells (bohn et al., 1987), and fetal dopaminergic neurons (dunnet et al., 1988; hauser et al., 1999). fibroblasts and
astrocytes have the advantage that they can be used for autologous transplantation. however, fibroblasts produce collagen
and induce gliosis in the cns (kawaja and gage, 1992), and
astrocytes are difficult to manipulate in culture. also, astrocytes
may be difficult to obtain from diseased brain tissue. human
fetal transplants do not survive well in the adult brain, apparently because they rely on lipid metabolism (rosenstein, 1995).
also, allogeneic cells from human fetuses may promote immune rejection (lopez-lozan o et al., 1997), and they raise ethical and legal issues. accordingly, none of the cell types tested
to date fulfill the four criteria for donor cells.
we suggest an alternative donor cell source for neural transplantation: the bone marrow (azizi et al., 1998). marrow stromal cells (mscs) are multipotential stem cells that differentiate into osteoblasts, adipocytes, and myoblasts (owen and
friedenstein, 1988; caplan, 1991; bruder et al., 1997;
kuznetsov et al., 1997; prockop, 1997; yoo et al., 1998). evidence suggests that mscs may also migrate through the
blood– brain barrier to contribute to cell lineages of the cns
(eglitis and mezey, 1997; pereira et al., 1998). human marrow
stromal cells (hmscs), when transplanted into the adult rat
brain, survive, integrate well, and do not elicit immune responses (azizi et al., 1998). furthermore, hmscs can be easily obtained from the patient’ s marrow, isolated by their adherence to plastic, expanded and engineered in culture, and
autologously transplanted into the same patient.
here, we have genetically engineered rat marrow stromal
cells (rm scs) and hmscs by transduction with retroviruses encoding th and/or gc. we demonstrate that the transduced cells
produce l -dopa in vitro and maintain multipotentiality after

schwarz et al.
transduction. also, the transduced rmscs produced l -dopa
and reduced apomorphine-ind uced rotation for about 9 days after transplantation into 6-hydroxydopam ine (6-ohda)-lesioned rats.

materials and methods
retroviral vectors
retroviral vectors lncx-th and p d ghcgc were kindly
provided by u.j. kang (bencsics et al., 1996). briefly, the
cdna encoding the human th type 2 gene was inserted into
the hindiii–clai sites of the moloney murine leukemia virusderived plasmid plncx (miller and rosman, 1989), downstream of the cytomegaloviru s (cmv) promoter. the rat gc
cdna was inserted into the bglii–clai sites downstream of the
cmv promoter in p d ghc. the lncx-th plasmid contained
the gene for aminoglycoside phosphotransferas e as a  xxxg418xxx -selectable marker, and p d ghcgc contained the gene for hygromycin b-phosphotransf erase. the plasmids lncx-th and
p d ghcgc were transfected separately into the pt67 amphotropic packaging cell line (clontech laboratories, palo alto,
ca) by calcium phosphate precipitation. to obtain stable virusproducing cell lines, the transfected packaging cells were selected for 10 days in either  xxxg418xxx  (400 m g/ml) or hygromycin
b (150 m g/ml) and the medium was collected from the stable
pools. the virus-containing medium was used to infect nih
3t3 cells to assay for viral titer. titers of at least 10 5 pfu/ml
were obtained for both the th- and the gc-expressin g retroviruses.

isolation of primary rmscs and hmscs with
th and/or gc
primary cultures of rmscs were obtained from the femurs
and tibias of adult male lewis rats (harlan, indianapolis, in).
the rats were euthanized with a mixture of 70% co 2 in
30% o 2 . the animals were shaved and prepared with alcohol
and provodine solution. tibias and femurs were removed and
placed on ice in complete medium containing minimal essential medium with a -modification (a -mem) (gibco-brl,
gaithersburg, md) with 20% fetal calf serum (atlanta biologicals, norcross, ga), 2 mm l -glutamine (gibco-brl), penicillin (100 units/ml), streptomycin (100 m g/ml), and  xxxd164xxx  (25 ng/ml) (mediatech, herndon, va). under sterile
conditions, a 21-gauge needle attached to a 10-ml syringe filled
with medium was used to flush out the marrow. the stromal
cells were plated in a 75-cm 2 flask (becton dickinson, franklin
lakes, nj) and isolated by their adherence to plastic. the nonadherent cells were rem oved and the medium replaced after 24
hr to remove further adherent hem atopoietic cells. the cultures
were incubated with dispase (2.4 units/ml; gibco, grand island, ny) for 10 min on the fourth day, and the medium was
again replaced. after the cells had grown to confluency (about
10 days), they were passaged two to six times by being detached (0.25% trypsin and 1 mm edta for 5 min) and replated
after dilution to about 1:4. primary cultures of hmscs were
obtained as described previously (azizi et al., 1998). briefly,
hmscs were obtained from human volunteers ranging in age
from 19 to 49 years. twenty-m illiliter aspirates were taken from

l -dopa

from engineered marrow stromal cells

the iliac crest of each donor, diluted with 20 ml of hanks’  xxxd2988xxx  (hbss; gibco-brl), and washed by gentle inversion several times. ten milliliters of  xxxd3253xxx  (ficollpaque; pharmacia, piscataway, nj) was layered beneath 40 ml
of sample and spun at 2500 3 g for 30 min at room temperature. the mononuclear cell layer was recovered from the gradient interface and washed with hbss. cells were spun at
3000 3 g for 30 min and resuspended in complete medium .
cells (about 2 3 106 ) were plated in a 15-cm tissue culture dish
(fisher scientific, pittsburgh, pa) and incubated at 37°c with
5% humidified co 2 . after 24 hr, the nonadherent layer was removed. the adherent layer was washed twice with phosphatebuffered saline (pbs) and fresh com plete medium was added.
the medium was replaced every 3 or 4 days and the cells were
grown to 70 to 90% confluency. the cells were harvested with
0.25% trypsin and 1 mm edta (gibco-brl) for 5 min at
37°c. about 8 ml of complete medium was mixed with the
trypsinized cells to inactivate the trypsin, and the cells were
counted with a hemocytomete r and passaged by plating at 5000
cells/cm 2 .

transduction of rmscs and hmscs
for cells expressing only th, rmscs and hmscs were plated
at 400,000 cells in a 78.6-cm 2 culture dish the day before infection in complete medium containing 20% heat-inactivated
fetal calf serum. the cells were infected with th retrovirus for
4 and 20 hr on one day and then for 4 and 20 hr on the following day in the presence of polybrene (8 m g/ml). at 48 hr,
fresh medium with 20% fetal calf serum (not heat inactivated)
was added and at 72 hr, and the cells were split 1:3 and selected
in complete medium containing  xxxg418xxx  (200 m g/ml) for a period
of 14 days. the rem aining cells were pooled and expanded for
experiments (rmsc-th and hmsc-th). for the doubly transduced rmscs, the cells were infected first with retrovirus expressing gc and selected in hygromycin b (15 m g/ml) for 14
days. the rmsc-gc were expanded, infected with th retrovirus, and doubly selected in hygromycin b (15 m g/ml) and
 xxxg418xxx  (200 m g/ml) for 14 days. the surviving cells were pooled
and expanded for experim ents (rmsc-thgc).

in vitro immunohistochemical staining
cells were plated in two-well cham ber slides. for bromodeoxyuridine (brdu) labeling of rmscs, cells were plated at
low confluency and incubated with 5 m m brdu (sigma, st.
louis, mo) for 48 hr. cells were fixed with 100% ice-cold
methanol for 10 min. for th staining alone, the cells were immunostained with a polyclonal antibody against rat th (pelfreeze, rogers, az) at a dilution of 1:250 in 0.1% bovine serum
albumin (bsa)–pbs. for double-labeling experiments, slides
were incubated in 2 n hcl for 60 min at 37°c. the acid was
neutralized by placing the slides in 0.1 m borate buffer, ph 8.5.
slides were incubated with a 1:500 monoclonal anti-brdu
(sigma) and 1:100 polyclonal anti-th (pel-freeze) in 0.1%
bsa–pbs. a rhodamine-conju gated goat anti-rabbit secondary
antibody (jackson immunoresear ch, west grove, pa) was used
at a dilution of 1:200 for th and a fluorescein isothiocyanate
(fitc)-conju gated goat anti-mouse secondary antibody
(sigma) was used at a dilution of 1:200 for brdu. for 49 ,6-diamidino-2-phen ylindole (dapi) counterstaining, slides were

2541

incubated with dapi (1 m g/ml; sigma) after incubation with
the secondary antibody.

adipocyte and osteogenic differentiation
rmsc-th, hmsc-th, and rmsc-thgc were plated in
9.62-cm 2 wells of a microtiter plate. after confluency, the triplicate wells were incubated for 3 weeks in either osteogenic
medium or adipogenic medium . the osteogenic medium contained 10 2 8 m dexamethasone , 0.2 mm  xxxd228xxx  (sigma),
and 10 mm b -glycerolphospha te (sigma). the adipogenic
medium contained 0.5 m m hydrocortisone, 0.5 mm  xxxd2388xxx , and 60 m m indomethacin. the medium was
replaced every 3 days. to assess mineralization, cells were
washed with pbs, fixed in 100% ice-cold methanol for 10 min,
and stained for 15 min with 1 ml of alizarin red (ph 4.1; sigma)
on a shaker at room temperature. cells were then washed with
water five times. to assess lipid deposition, cells in adipogenic
medium were washed with pbs and fixed for 1 hr with 10%
formalin. cells were stained for 15 min with a diluted oil redo solution (sigma). the diluted solution was made by mixing
three parts of a stock solution (0.5% in isopropanol) with two
parts water and filtering it through a 0.4- m m pore size filter.

high-performance liquid chromatography
rmsc-th and rmsc-thgc (about 50,000) were plated in
9.62-cm 2 wells in a six-well dish. hmsc-th were plated in duplicate in 28.27-cm 2 dishes. cells were grown to confluence
and then assayed for l -dopa secreted into the medium. hplc
was performed on an octadecylsilane (c 18 ) column (microsorb
short-one; rainin instruments, woburn, ma) with a mobile
phase of 8.5% methanol in buffer (75 mm sodium phosphate,
10 m m disodium edta, and 1.4 mm octane sulfonic acid, ph
2.90). coulom etric detection (coulochem ii 5100a; esa, bedford, ma) was perform ed after sequential oxidation and reduction with the guard cell at a potential of 0.4 v, electrode 1
at 2 0.25 v, and electrode 2 at 0.35 v. cells were placed in
hbss with 25 mm hepes at ph 7.1. at t 5 0, 50 m m l -tyrosine and 100 m m bh 4 were added to the cells. a 20- m l sam ple of medium was added to 80 m l of 75 mm perchloric acid
and assayed for l -dopa. after the experiment, the cells were
counted on a hem ocytometer.

surgical grafting procedures
rmsc-th and rmsc-thgc at confluence were incubated
with bis-benzimide (1 m g/ml; sigma) for 48 hr prior to transplantation. the cells were washed three times, trypsinized, and
diluted in a -mem to a final concentration of 10,000 cells/ m l.
the cell suspension was placed on ice until animals were
anesthetized. nine male sprague-daw ley albino 6-hydroxydopamine-lesion ed rats (200–300 g) were obtained from
taconic farms (germ antown, ny). the lesions were produced
by unilateral infusion of 8 m g of 6-hydroxydopam ine at a concentration of 2 m g/m l and a rate of 1 m l/min into the nigrostriatal pathway. apomorphine -induced rotation was assayed before shipment of the rats. all animal use was in accordance with
institutional and nih guidelines for the use of vertebrate animals. anesthesia was induced with 3% halothane in oxygen in
a sealed chamber. anesthesia was maintained with an intra-

2542
muscular injection of a mixture of xylazine (6 mg/kg) and ketamine (60 mg/kg). the animals were transferred to a stereotaxic apparatus in a clean field. a 2- to 5-mm incision was made
in the scalp 2 mm lateral to bregma. with a dental drill, a burr
hole was drilled in the bone 3 mm approximately lateral to
bregma, and 10 m l of the cell suspension was injected over a
period of 30 min into the striatum at a depth of 4 mm from the
surface of the brain. a total of 100,000 cells was injected into
each animal. the wound was closed with interrupted surgical
sutures, and the animals were treated with xylazine (0.6 mg/kg)
and ketamine (6 mg/kg) for analgesia. five rats were injected
with rmsc-thgc and four rats were injected with rmsc-th.
rats were sacrificed at specific time points by intracardiac perfusion under deep anesthesia with xylazine and ketamine. the
rats were perfused with pbs, followed by 3% ice-cold
paraformaldehyd e, and finally 10% sucrose. the brains were
removed, the forebrains were trimmed, and the samples were
frozen for histological analysis.

behavioral experiments
five rmsc-thgc-transplanted and three rmsc-th-transplanted rats were tested before and after transplantation for apomorphine-induc ed rotation. apomorphine (0.05 mg/kg) was injected intraperitoneally and the number of rotations in a 15-min
period was counted. only animals exhibiting more than six rotations per minute were used for experiments. animals were
tested before and 2/3, 7, and 14 days after transplantation. data
were analyzed by paired t test com pared with pretransplant rotation values.

microdialysis experiments
three rats treated with rmsc-thgc cells and one rat treated
with rmsc-th cells were implanted with an intracerebral dialysis probe guide cannula at the time of transplantation. the rats
were anesthetized and positioned in a stereotaxic frame. body
temperature was maintained at 37°c with a temperature-con trolled heat pad (ys1 incorporated, yellow springs, oh; model
73a ). hair from the top of the head was shaven and the skin
was scrubbed with betadine scrub solution. the skull was exposed and a burr hole drilled at the position indicated above.
two additional holes were drilled for placement of screws
(small parts, miami lakes, fl) to facilitate adhesion of dental
cement. a microdialysis probe guide cannula (cma/microdialysis, acton, ma) was inserted to a depth of 3 mm from the
top of the brain. the guide cannula was cemented to the skull
with dental cement and the skin sutured. in one rat transplanted
with rmsc-thgc, a second guide cannula was transplanted in
the unlesioned contralateral side at the same position. the shafts
were designed so that only the membrane of the probe (4 mm)
extended past the end of the guide cannula on probe insertion.
microdialysis was perform ed before and 3 and 9 days after cell
transplantation, as indicated. the microdialysis perfusion fluid
contained 25 mm nahco 3 , 122 mm nacl, 1.3 mm  xxxg2125xxx  2 , 1.2
mm mgso 4 , 3 mm kcl, and 0.4 mm kh 2 po 4 , with the ph
adjusted to 7.35 with bubbling co 2 . continuous flow through
the microdialysis probe was maintained with a gas-tight glass
syringe (hamilton, reno, nv) in a microsyringe pump
(cma/100; cma/microdialysis). for all experim ents, the flow
was maintained at 1 m l/min. the dialysates were collected at

schwarz et al.
intervals of 30 min for 4 hr. perfusion fluid switching was done
with a low-volum e switch (cma/1 10 liquid switch; cma/microdialysis). the probe effluent was collected into small microcentrifuge tubes containing 75 mm perchloric acid. samples
were analyzed by hplc, using electrochemical detection.

in vivo immunohistochemical staining
fifteen-m icron tissue sections were prepared with a cryostat.
the transplanted rmscs were located by microscopically identifying the bis-benzimide-la beled cells in the tissue sections under uv light. frozen sections were attached to superfrost plus
slides (fisher scientific) and immunocytoch emistry was performed at room temperature. tissue sections were treated with
0.1% bsa–pbs for 1 hr, cell membranes were solubilized for
10 min with 0.1% triton x-100, and the sections were incubated overnight with anti-th at 1:100. the follow ing day, the
sections were washed with pbs and incubated with rhodamineconjugated goat anti-rabbit serum at a dilution of 1:200 for 1
hr. tissue sections were then visualized for th staining.

results
genetically engineered primary mscs produce
l -dopa in vitro
rmscs and hmscs were transduced either with a retroviral
vector containing th or with two retroviral vectors, one encoding th and the other encoding gc. the cells were selected
either with hygromycin b or with a combination of hygromycin
b and the neomycin analog  xxxg418xxx . stable clones of rmscs transduced with both viruses were readily obtained. hmscs transduced with both viruses were not obtained in the experim ents
here, apparently because the cells did not expand as rapidly in
culture as the rmscs. as indicated in color plate 1, most of
the cells in the pooled samples of selected rmscs and hmscs
were positive for th by immunostainin g. the intensity of immunostaining did not decrease for up to 15 passages of the cells.
also, transduction of the cells did not alter their morphology.
as indicated in fig. 1a, rmscs transduced with the th gene
produced l -dopa in culture only if incubated with 100 m m
bh 4 , an essential cofactor required by th. in contrast, rmscs
transduced with both the gene for th and the gene for gc synthesized l -dopa without addition of the cofactor (fig. 1b).
the rates of l -dopa synthesis were roughly one-third the rate
achieved by rmsc-th cells in the presence of the cofactor
(3.83 6 0.27 nmol/hr/10 6 cells for rmsc-th versus 1.05 6
0.128 nmol/hr/10 6 cells for rmsc-thgc). as indicated in fig.
1c, hmscs transduced with the gene for th also synthesized
l -dopa in the presence of bh 4 . the rates of production of l dopa were slightly less than with the rmscs (2.33 nmol/hr/10 6
cells), apparently because of a lower efficiency of transduction
or a lower level of gene expression from the cytomegalovirus
(cmv) promoter.

osteogenic or adipogenic medium for 3 weeks. as reported previously (see bohic et al., 1998), confluent cultures of rmscs
generate mineralized nodules when incubated in osteogenic
medium containing  xxxd228xxx , b -glycerol phosphate, and
dexamethasone. hmscs generate sheets of mineral that obscure
the cell morphology. as indicated in color plate 2a–c, the
transduced rmscs and hmscs both differentiated into osteoblasts. similarly, both the transduced rmscs and hmscs
differentiated into adipocytes when incubated in adipogenic
medium containing hydrocortisone, isobutylm ethylxanthine,
and indomethacin. no difference was observed between transduced and control mscs either in the osteogenic or adipogenic
medium (data not shown).

engrafted rmscs induce behavioral recovery in
6-ohda-lesioned rats
to test the efficacy of the transduced cells in vivo, a rat model
for parkinson disease was employed. the rats were purchased
after unilateral destruction of dopaminergic cells in the substantia nigra pars compacta with 6-ohda. apomorphine-i nduced rotation was assayed 3 weeks prior to infusion of mscs
and 2/3, 7 and 14 days after infusion of the cells. because expression of both genes was required for synthesis of l -dopa
(fig. 1), rmsc-thgc were used for the experiments. a significant reduction in the rotational response was seen in rats
that received infusions of about 100,000 rmscs transduced with
both the th and gc genes (fig. 2). rats that received rmscthgc decreased their rate of rotation to 32 6 7% of the control rate at 2/3 days, and to 46 6 9% of the control rate  xxxd2274xxx 
days. however, no effect was observed at 14 days, apparently
because the transgene was no longer expressed (see below). as
indicated in fig. 2, there was no response in rats that received
rmscs transduced with the th gene alone.

synthesis of catecholamines in brains of the
engrafted rats
to assay the synthesis of l -dopa and metabolites in the
brains of recipient rats, a microdialysis probe was placed in the
denervated striatum 3 and 9 days posttransplantatio n. after 3
days, l -dopa and metabolites were detected in the basal gan-

schwarz et al.
glia of rats that received rmscs transduced with both the th
and gc genes. as indicated in fig. 3a, the concentration of l dopa in the dialysate was about 398 6 113 nm. lesser
amounts of dihydroxyphenyla cetic acid (dopac), 3-o-methyldopa (3-omd), hom ovanillic acid (hva), and 5-hydroxyindole acetic acid (5-hiaa) were detected. dopac is a unique
metabolite of dopamine. therefore, the results indicated that l dopa was converted to dopamine. low levels of dopamine
(about 2 nm) were also detected. the level of l -dopa and
metabolites remained constant in samples that were collected
every 30 min for 4 hr. after 9 days, however, none of the
metabolites except for 5-hiaa were detected in the rats that
received rmsc-thgc. in the rat that received rmscs with the
th gene alone, none of the metabolites except for 5-hiaa were
detected at any time (not shown). these results agree with previous observations showing that fibroblasts transduced with the
th gene alone did not produce l -dopa in vivo (bencsics et
al., 1996).
in the rat in which probes were inserted into both sides of
the brain, the level of dopac in the unlesioned side of the rat
striatum was about 10 times the level (1366 6 171 nm)
achieved with the infused rmscs expressing th and gc into
the lesioned side (fig. 3b). the level of hva was also about
10 times higher in the unlesioned side (1068 6 127 nm). in the
unlesioned side, no l -dopa was detected and there was no difference in l -dopa metabolites before and after transplant.
therefore, l -dopa and metabolites did not diffuse to the contralateral side of the brain.

immunocytochemical detection of th in transduced
rmscs in vivo
to assay further the expression of th in the brains of recipient rats, immunocytochem istry was performed. before infusion, the nuclei of transduced rmscs were labeled with bisbenzimide (1 m g/ml) (lachapelle et al., 1994; azizi et al., 1998)
for 48 hr. the nuclear label was readily detected in culture
(color plate 3a) and in frozen sections of the brain (color plate
3b and d). in the same sections from rats 3 days after infusion
of transduced rmscs, th was detected (color plate 3c and e).

rmscs, cells were still detected in brain as reflected by the presence of bis-benzimide-la beled nuclei (color plate 3f). however, th was no longer expressed (color plate 3g).

engraftment and survival of transplanted rmscs
to follow the engraftment and migration of the infused
rmscs, serial sections of brain were examined from rats that
received cells labeled with bis-benzimide. as indicated in color
plate 4, 87 days after the infusion, bis-benzim ide-labeled nuclei were readily detected in frozen sections of the brain. the
cells had migrated rostrally in a narrow tract (color plate 4a).
also, they had migrated caudally in a narrow tract. the results
confirmed the ability of the mscs to survive for long intervals
in vivo. also, the results confirmed previous indications that
mscs infused into brain migrate extensively (azizi et al.,
1998). staining of sections with alizarin red did not reveal any
evidence of the mscs producing mineral in the brain. as reported previously, the cells synthesized collagen i in culture but
not after infusion in the brain (azizi et al., 1998). also, the
cells synthesized fibronectin in culture. after infusion in the
brain, staining with antibodies to fibronectin was observed at 5
days. after 30 or 72 days the area of staining with fibronectin
in the body was markedly decreased.

discussion
the results here dem onstrate that mscs can be gene engineered to produce l -dopa and metabolites in vitro and in vivo.
also, they demonstrate that mscs retain their multipotentiality after transduction with viral vectors. accordingly, insertion
of virally transduced genes does not dramatically alter the potential of the cells to differentiate or to integrate after infusion

into the brain (azizi et al., 1998). therefore, the results support previous indications that mscs are attractive vehicles for
delivery of transgenes to the central nervous system.
in the experiments described here, it was necessary to transduce the cells with both the gene for th and the gene for gc
in order to obtain production of l -dopa and metabolites without the addition of cofactor. after denervation of the striatum ,
the level of the cofactor bh 4 is reduced to 25% or less of the
normal level (levine et al., 1981). furthermore, most cell types
employed for neural transplantation, except for an endocrine tumor cell line (horrellou et al., 1990), do not have endogenous
bh 4 . with the expression of both th and gc, secreted l -dopa
was converted to dopamine as indicated by the synthesis of
dopac. the lesioned striatum in the rat models as well as in
parkinson patients appears to possess sufficient levels of endogenous  xxxg618xxx  for conversion of l -dopa to dopamine
(abercrombie et al., 1990; wachtel and abercrombie, 1994).
previously, observations by fan et al. (1998) suggested that coexpression of the th and  xxxg618xxx  genes in the denervated striatum was more effective than expression of the th gene alone.
however, wachtel et al. (1997) observed that expression of
 xxxg618xxx  by transduced fibroblasts in vivo appeared to decrease
the synthesis of l -dopa by transduced fibroblasts expressing
both th and gc, apparently because generation of dopamine
in close proximity to th produced feedback inhibition of the
hydroxylase.
the levels of dopac observed after infusion of rmscthgc into the lesioned striatum were less than one-tenth the
value in the contralateral unlesioned striatum. it is possible that
higher levels could be achieved by infusion of larger num bers
of cells. however, the levels achieved here were sufficient to
reduce the apom orphine-induced rotation of the rats. in their
experiments with fibroblasts expressing th and gc, bencsics
et al. (1996) did not observe a significant effect on apomorphine-induced rotation even though they obtained a higher rate

of l -dopa synthesis in culture (2.16 6 1.9 nmol/hr/10 6 by fibroblasts versus 1.05 6 0.13 nmol/hr/10 6 by rmsc-thgc),
and infused three to four times as many cells as were used here.
the discrepancy may be explained by the fact that the levels of
l -dopa they achieved in vivo were less than those observed
here even though they perform ed their microdialysis assays after inhibition of  xxxg618xxx  with nsd1015. apparently, higher levels were achieved with rmsc-thgc either because of better
survival of the cells or because of better transient expression of
the transgene in vivo.
expression of transgenes from the integrated retrovirus
lncx ceased by 9 days after implantation of the rmscs into
the brain even though expression of the genes was stable in cul-

ture. similar results were obtained by others when the same
retroviruses were used to express transgenes in the brain. bencsics et al. (1996) observed inactivation over about 1 wk of the
th gene after fibroblasts transduced with a retrovirus were introduced into brain. lundberg et al. (1996) also observed inactivation in brain of the th gene with astrocytes retrovirally
transduced with the th gene. transient expression of transgenes transduced with retroviruses is apparently caused by transcription interference or suppression by the long terminal repeats (ltrs) (see zufferey et al., 1998). however, several
observations indicate that the problem of long-term expression
in brain can be overcome by using alternative vectors or means
of transfection. in particular, naldini et al. (1996) reported that

2548

schwarz et al.

use of a lentiviral vector based on human immunodeficiency
virus provided stable expression in vivo in terminally differentiated neurons for 28 weeks. also, during et al. (1994) obtained
expression of the th gene for up to 1 year by introducing the
gene with a defective herpes simplex virus type 1. in addition,
several reports (see zufferey et al., 1998) indicate that use of
a self-inactivating retrovirus that eliminates the ltrs reduces
the possibility of transcriptional interference and suppression
of the gene. therefore, one or more of these strategies could
provide long-term expression by mscs in brain. mscs provide
an attractive vehicle for obtaining long-term synthesis of l dopa and metabolites in brain since they integrate and survive for long periods of time.
