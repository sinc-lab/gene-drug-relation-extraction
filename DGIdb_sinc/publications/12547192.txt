the interactions of human  xxxg730xxx  subtypes era and erb with
dna and a 210 amino acid residue fragment of the coactivator protein
 xxxg1510xxx  bearing three nuclear receptor interaction motifs were investigated
quantitatively using fluorescence anisotropy in the presence of agonist
and antagonist ligands. era and erb were found to bind in a similar
manner to dna, and both salt and temperature affected the affinity
and/or stoichiometry of these interactions. the agonist ligands estradiol,
estrone and estriol did not modify the binding of era to the fluoresceinlabeled target estrogen response element. however, in the case of erb,
these ligands led to the formation of some higher-order protein –dna
complexes and a small decrease in affinity. the partial agonist  xxxd91xxx  had little effect on either er subtype, whereas the pure
antagonist  xxxd2165xxx ,780 led to the cooperative formation of protein –dna
complexes of higher order than dimer, as further demonstrated by competition experiments and gel mobility-shift assays. in addition to dna
binding, the interaction of both er subtypes with the alexa488-labeled
 xxxg1510xxx  coactivator fragment was investigated by fluorescence anisotropy.
the agonist ligands estrone, estradiol, estriol, genistein and ethynyl
estradiol exhibited distinct capacities for inducing the recruitment of
 xxxg1510xxx  that were not correlated with their affinity for the receptor. moreover, estrone and genistein exhibited subtype specificity in that they
induced  xxxg1510xxx  recruitment to erb with much higher efficiency than in
the case of era. the differential coactivator recruitment capacities of the
er agonists and their receptor subtype coactivator recruitment specificity
may be linked to the molecular structure of the agonists with respect to
their interactions with a specific histidine residue located at the back of
the ligand-binding pocket. altogether, these quantitative in vitro studies
of er interactions reveal the complex energetic and stoichiometric consequences of changes in the chemical structures of these proteins and their
ligands.

introduction
estrogen receptors (ers) are ligand-activated
transcription factors that mediate the effects of the
steroid hormone estrogen on the growth, development and function of a diverse range of tissues.1
two human ers (era and erb) have been identified, and exhibit modular structures characteristic
of the nuclear receptor (nr) superfamily2 with
an n-terminal ligand-independent activation
domain, a central dna-binding domain (dbd)
and a c-terminal ligand-binding domain (lbd)

bearing the ligand-dependent transcriptional
activation function (af2). era and erb share an
overall 64% homology, but the degree of homology
depends strongly upon the domain under consideration (only 16% for the n-terminal domain,
59% for the lbd and 97% for the dbd). thus,
although the known selectivity of er subtypes lies
in their unique sequences, the molecular determinants of the subtype selectivity in the multiple
aspects of er function have not been identified.
in the case of the ers, agonist binding leads to
sub-nuclear re-localization and dissociation from
heat shock proteins.3 the receptor is then able to
bind to its target dna and to recruit
transcriptional coactivators. these proteins are
involved in chromatin remodeling (acetylation,
methylation, etc.) and induce the formation of a
multi-protein complex that recruits the basal transcription machinery.4 – 7 among the coactivators,
those belonging to the  xxxg1449xxx  family exist as
three isoforms called  xxxg1510xxx , src-2 (or tif-2) and
 xxxg1512xxx .8 they bind to nuclear receptors in an
agonist-dependent manner through three highly
conserved lxxll motifs called nr-boxes and
recruit other coactivators such as cbp/p300 or
p/caf7,9 – 12 to a large complex that exhibits histone
accetyltransferase activity.
no structure of any full-length nuclear receptor
has been solved to date. however, a large number
of crystal and nmr structures of various nr
dbds and lbds have been solved.13 – 15 nuclear
receptors bind specifically to dna sequences
called hormone response elements through the
dbds. the ers bind as homodimers to pseudo(or perfect) palindromic response elements with
the consensus sequence aggtcannntgacct,
termed the estrogen response element (ere). the
dbd of the nuclear receptors consists of two highly
conserved zinc finger motifs, one of which presents
the determinants for dimerization and the other
for specific dna binding. despite a high degree
of sequence conservation among nr dbds, this
domain bears the sequence-specificity determinants for dna binding by these receptors.16
although the isolated er dbd is monomeric in
solution up to millimolar concentrations,17 this
fragment dimerizes upon dna binding, as shown
by the crystal structure of the era dbd/ere
complex.18 the two monomers bind two consecutive dna major grooves, establishing an energetically coupled network of contacts with the
phosphate groups on each side of the groove,
allowing an a-helix (called the p-box and known
to bear the interaction specificity determinants) to
establish direct contact with the bases. the entire
dna –protein interface displays high complementarity, allowing the exclusion of many (except
seven specific) water molecules upon interaction.
despite the low level of sequence identity
between the lbds of the nr superfamily, a
common fold is observed for all these receptors to
date.15 with the exception of some slight variations,
these domains fold into an a-helical sandwich (12

 xxxg730xxx  interactions

a-helices and a b-sheet). about 50 crystal structures of nr lbds bound by agonists, antagonists,
or without hormones have been solved. moreover,
some of them have been co-crystallized with
peptides derived from the nr boxes of  xxxg1449xxx  coactivators. these structures show the fundamental role
played by helix 12 (which is highly implicated in
the ligand-dependent activation function) through
a mechanism called the mouse-trap model. in
the absence of hormone,  xxxg1956xxx  appears slightly
unfolded. in the presence of an agonist,  xxxg1956xxx  closes
onto the ligand-binding pocket, and creates a
hydrophobic groove in which the coactivator peptide can bind through hydrophobic residues from
its lxxll motif. in the case of antagonist binding,
two different mechanisms have been observed.
when the antagonist has a bulky side-chain,  xxxg1956xxx 
is displaced outward due to steric hindrance, and
takes the place of the coactivator peptide in the
hydrophobic groove, precluding the nr-coactivator interaction. for small antagonists (like 5,11cis-diethyl-5,6,11,12-tetrahydrochrysene-2,8-diol
(thc) binding to erb lbd), antagonism arises
from the inability of the ligand to promote stabilizing interactions with the receptor in order to
lock  xxxg1956xxx  in the “active” conformation (passive
antagonism).19 the isolated era lbd exists as a
dimer in the crystal and at least down to 1 mm in
solution,20 with a strong dimerization interface
(about 15% of the lbd surface) involving h10 and
h11. since era and erb display similar dimerization interfaces, hetero-dimerization is possible
between these receptors. this has been shown
both in vivo and in vitro and, since the two receptor
subtypes are co-expressed in some tissues, the
physiological role of any putative hetero-dimer
remains to be elucidated.21 – 23
transcriptional regulation by nuclear receptors
involves many inter-dependent protein– ligand,
protein– dna, and protein– protein interactions.
however, to date, only a few studies have
attempted to characterize, quantitatively, the
energetics of these molecular interactions, using
purified macromolecules and equilibrium-based
techniques. information concerning the intrinsic
behavior of the molecules (free from their cellular
context) is key to establishing the structure– function relationships involved in the regulation and
the specificity of er interactions. fluorescence
spectroscopy has been used here, since it allows
for measurements under controlled conditions,
at equilibrium. its sensitivity and reproducibility
make it a powerful tool for the investigation of
biological macromolecular interactions.
in previous studies we characterized era –dna
interactions based on changes in the anisotropy
of the fluorescence emission of a fluorescent dye
covalently bound to the 50 -end of the sense strand
of the target ere derived from consensus ere
sequence upstream of the vitellogenin promoter
(vitere).24 moreover, we have determined the
stoichiometry (1:1) and affinity of the complex between a fragment of the transcriptional

coactivator  xxxg1510xxx  bearing the three central nr
box motifs and the era dimer.20 in this work, we
investigate the effects of salt concentration, temperature and ligand binding on the affinity and
stoichiometry of the interaction between erb
and its ere, thus extending and completing our
previous studies on era. we examine, as well, the
fundamental role of the structure of the agonist
molecules in the promotion of  xxxg1510xxx  interaction
with the receptors, regardless of the agonist affinity
for the receptors, and we demonstrate agonist subtype selectivity in the ability to promote er/ xxxg1510xxx 
complex formation.

results
effects of experimental conditions on the
interactions of era and erb with the ere
in these studies we have used commercial
preparations of full-length human era and erb
expressed from baculoviral vectors in insect cells
and purified to homogeneity (panvera corp,
madison, wi). their binding to the consensus ere
was examined using a 35 bp, double-stranded
oligonucleotide labeled at the 50 position of the
sense strand using a fluorescein phosphoramidite
with a six carbon atom linker. this oligonucleotide
bearing the palindromic aggtca half-site with
a 3 bp separation was one of those used in our
previous studies of era/dna interactions24 and
is termed f-vitere. given the long linker between
the fluorophore and the dna, the steady-state
anisotropy of the free oligonucleotide is quite low
(approximately 60 £ 1023 anisotropy units), since
the local motions of the probe contribute significantly to the overall depolarization. time-resolved
anisotropy measurements using frequency domain
fluorometry on this oligonucleotide revealed that
81% of the total depolarization is due to a very
fast 500 ps motion (table 1). the remaining 19%
arises from the global tumbling of the oligonucleotide yielding a correlation time of approximately
7 ns.
upon titration of this oligonucleotide with erb
at 200 mm kcl and at 21 8c, the anisotropy
increases in a sigmoidal manner (figure 1(a)). our
previous results on era are shown under the
same conditions for comparison. the anisotropy
of the labeled ere increases significantly in the
presence of both receptors. time-resolved fluorescence of the era-ere complex revealed a two-

fold increase in both the amplitude and value
of the rotational correlation time due to global
molecular tumbling (table 1). the profiles in
figure 1(a) demonstrate that the overall affinity of
erb for this target oligonucleotide is slightly
lower than that of era, with a shift in the midpoint
of binding by a factor of approximately 2 to higher
concentrations (c1/2 ¼ 8 nm for era versus 20 nm
for erb). we analyzed the titration curve for erb
binding in terms of a model in which protein
dimerization is coupled to dna binding, assuming
a monomer-bound oligonuclotide as the intermediate species. thus  xxxg660xxx  corresponds to the formation of the monomer-bound dna complex
and dg2 corresponds to the formation of the
dimer-bound dna complex, both starting from
free monomer and free oligonucleotide. the
cooperative free energy is calculated as:
dg2 2 2dg1
an equilibrium titration cannot distinguish
between a monomer-bound oligonucleotide and a
free dimer intermediate. the free energies recovered from fits of the titration curve to the model
described above are given in table 2. the lower
apparent overall affinity of erb compared to era
of about 1 kcal/mol (1 cal ¼ 4.184 j) could be due
to a lower activity of the erb preparations relative
to the preparations of era. however, the concentration of receptor determined by ligand binding
and that of total protein determined by bradford
assays are quite close, indicating that both preparations are over 90% pure and active. it is interesting that the cooperative free energy for erb
binding to the oligonucleotide under these conditions was larger than that of era, . 1.2 versus
0.6 kcal/mol, indicating a difference in the subunit
interactions between the two subtypes.
the effect of varying the concentration of kcl on
the interactions of erb with the target oligonucleotide is shown in figure 1(b). increasing the salt
concentration from 150 mm to 250 mm kcl at
21 8c results in a significant shift of the titration
curves to higher concentration, corresponding to
a loss of about 1 kcal/mol in overall affinity per
50 mm in kcl (table 2). moreover, between
150 mm and 200 mm kcl, the high concentration
anisotropy plateau value decreases significantly,
while at 250 mm, the curve tends towards the
same value as at 200 mm kcl (figure 1(b)). a
decrease in plateau value between 150 mm and
200 mm kcl was previously reported for era
binding to this target oligonucleotide;24 however,

150 mm kcl is significantly smaller at 4 8c than at
21 8c, and that it is comparable to that observed at
21 8c at 200 mm kcl. we interpret these results as
follows. at 150 mm kcl and at 21 8c, erb binds
to its target oligonucleotide first as a dimer but
also fractionally populates a complex of higher
order than dimer, probably tetramer. upon
decreasing the temperature to 4 8c or increasing
the salt concentration to 200 mm kcl, these
higher-order protein –protein interactions are
destabilized. at 200 mm kcl or above, temperature had little or no effect on the binding affinity
or apparent stoichiometry (data not shown).
this is consistent with the lack of temperaturedependence observed in our previously reported
results for era at 200 mm salt,24 which was interpreted as indicative of a significant heat capacity
and entropy change upon binding under these
conditions.
effects of agonist ligands on the interactions
of era and erb with the ere

the presence of e3 (v). ligands were present  xxxd1891xxx  mm.
the concentration of f-vitere was 1 nm. the buffer

lines through the points represent fits of the data
according to the model described in the text.

the difference was smaller than in the case of erb.
at very low concentrations of salt, era exhibited
a very high stoichiometry, high overall affinity
and low specificity in its interactions with dna.
the higher plateau at 150 mm compared to
200 mm kcl observed in these previous studies
was indicative of the fractional population of
some complexes of higher-order than dimer that
disappeared with increasing concentration of salt.
we show here that this effect is more apparent
for erb than era under the same conditions.
in figure 1(c) are shown the titration curves for
the target oligonucleotide with erb at 150 mm
kcl at 21 8c and 4 8c. for comparison, we have
presented the data as d anisotropy, given that a
decrease in temperature from 21 8c to 4 8c leads
to a significant increase in the anisotropy of the
free dna due to an increase in buffer viscosity.
the complete salt study of erb at 4 8c is shown in
figure 1(d), and the recovered free energy parameters are reported in table 2. it can be seen from
this comparison that the change in anisotropy at

the effect of agonists on the interactions of era
and erb with their target ere was examined. in
the case of era, no change in the profiles was
observed in presence of the agonists, estrone (e1),
estradiol (e2) and estriol (e3) (figure 2(a); table
2). this is in good agreement with our previously
published results on the effects of agonists using
the internally labeled target oligonucleotide.24 in
contrast, in the case of erb, the agonist ligands
appeared to promote some higher-order protein
complexes on the dna at the higher protein concentration end of the titration curves (figure 2(b);
table 2), as the high-concentration anisotropy
values did not reach a plateau, but rather continued to increase. this resulted, in the analysis, in
an apparent decrease of the cooperativity of
binding. the effect of the ligands on the er/ere
affinity is difficult to judge. the titration curves
were shifted to slightly higher concentrations of
protein in presence of e1 and e2, but the free
energies of complex formation were similar (table
2). since there were higher-order species likely
forming at high erb concentration, the recovered
free energies are only estimates.
effects of antagonist ligands on the
interactions of era and erb with the ere
we sought to compare the interactions of era
and erb in the presence of antagonist ligands
with the 50 -labeled target oligonucleotide,
f-vitere. in figure 3(a) and (b) are shown the
binding curves of era (not previously reported)
and erb, respectively, with this oligonucleotide at
4 8c in 150 mm kcl in the absence of ligand, in
the presence of the partial agonist,  xxxd91xxx  ( xxxd3285xxx ) and in the presence of the
antagonist  xxxd2165xxx ,780 (referred to in the following
simply as ici). the binding curves obtained in the
presence of  xxxd3285xxx  are similar to those observed in

the absence of ligand for both receptor subtypes.
in the case of era,  xxxd3285xxx  leads to a slight decrease
in affinity and an increase in cooperativity of
binding to dna, whereas in the case of erb, the
plateau in the presence of  xxxd3285xxx  occurs at slightly
higher anisotropy values, indicating a small fractional population of species of higher order than
dimer at the highest concentrations of protein. the
free energies and cooperativity values obtained
from the fits of the binding profiles according to a
coupled dimerization/dna binding model (as in
absence of ligand) in presence of  xxxd3285xxx  are given in
table 2.
in contrast to the modest effects of  xxxd3285xxx , a very
large difference in the total anisotropy change is
evident in the presence of the antagonist ici for
both er subtypes. similar results are obtained at
21 8c in the presence of 200 mm kcl (figure 3(c)).
the best fit of the binding profiles obtained in presence of ici was not to a model for the formation
of a dimer– dna complex (continuous line in
figure 3(a) and (b)), but to a model involving the

binding of two er dimers to dna (broken lines in
figure 3(a) and (b)). the values of the free energy
of formation of these tetramer complexes with
dna are given in table 2. the cooperativity was
so large that it could not be determined with
accuracy.
in our previously reported work,24 we examined
the effect of ligands on era – dna interactions
using a target oligonucleotide bearing the fluorescein moiety at an abasic site internal to the
sequence, five bases from the 50 -end of the sense
strand, vit-eref5, in order to restrict the local
motions. indeed, the steady-state anisotropy of
this fluorescein-labeled free oligonucleotide nearly
doubles from around 60 £ 1023 – 70 £ 1023 anisotropy units for the 50 -labeled fluorophore to about
140 £ 1023 anisotropy units for the internally
labeled oligonucleotide. in our previous studies,
no ligand-induced changes in the affinity were
observed; however, a small difference in highconcentration anisotropy plateau was apparent
for era– ere interactions in the presence of ici.

of non-specific dna oligonucleotide (x).the concentration of f-vitere was 1 nm. the buffer was tegd as
described in materials and methods. lines through the
points represent fits of the data according to the model
described in the text.

however, given the small magnitude of the effect,
we did not consider it significant at the time. in
order to verify that this small ici-induced change
in the anisotropy plateau was indeed reproducible
and observed for both era and erb, we examined
their binding to the vit-eref5 (internally labeled
oligonucleotide) at 21 8c in 200 mm kcl, in order
to avoid formation of any higher-order species in
the absence of ligand. the results of this titration
are shown in figure 3(d). also shown are the
previously reported data obtained for era under
the same conditions. as in figure 1(a), the overall
affinity of erb is shifted by a factor of approximately 2 to higher concentration compared to the
era binding profile. in addition, the midpoints of
these curves are nearly identical in concentration
with those obtained with the 50 -labeled oligonucleotide for both er subtypes, indicating that
the position of the label has no effect on the affinity.
we next chose to compare era and erb interactions with this oligonucleotide in the presence
of saturating antagonist ici. indeed, for both er
subtypes, a small increase in the anisotropy
plateau is observed for the internally labeled
sequence, in agreement with the results obtained
with the 50 -labeled f-vitere.

clearly, the increases in the high-concentration
anisotropy plateau values demonstrate that the
er – ere complexes are different in the presence
of ici. differences in anisotropy can arise from
changes in the global rotational tumbling time
due to differences in molecular size, i.e. arising
from the population of protein– dna complexes
of higher order than dimer. it is possible that the

83

differences observed in the steady-state anisotropy
plateau values originate in differences in the
conformation of the complexes such that the local
dynamics of the probe are more constrained in the
presence of this antagonist. this latter effect is not
incompatible with the population of species of
higher order than dimer. in an attempt to distinguish between these two possibilities, we performed time-resolved anisotropy experiments on
the complexes in the presence of ici. although the
global tumbling time recovered from the fit was
slightly higher in the presence of ici, the uncertainty in the recovered values (^ 20 ns) was too
large to provide a definitive answer. this is due to
the fact that the correlation time of the dimeric
complex, assuming a spherical object, should be
near 60 ns. this value is already larger than tenfold
the fluorescein lifetime of 4.1 ns, and thus at the
limit of resolvability.25 the binding of a second
dimer of 140,000 kda to the oligonucleotide
places the correlation time well beyond the limits
of resolvability by time-resolved fluorescence.
nonetheless, the observed increase in steady-state
anisotropy is well defined, and therefore probably
due to concomitant changes in the local probe
motions.
since it was not possible to demonstrate the
existence of protein –dna complexes of higher
order than dimer in the presence of ici by timeresolved anisotropy, we turned to a completely
different strategy. we reasoned that if a second (or
more) dimer binds to the complex, the addition
of sufficient unlabeled non-specific dna should
compete it away. this is indeed what is observed.
in figure 4, the binding curves for erb to the
50 -labeled target oligonucleotide at 4 8c and
150 mm kcl are shown in the absence of ligand,
in the presence of ici and in the presence of ici
and a 1000-fold excess of an unlabeled 27 bp oligonucleotide bearing no sequence resemblance to the
ere. it can be seen that one effect of this large
excess of unlabeled non-specific dna is to shift
the specific binding to higher concentrations. this
is because at such high concentrations of nonspecific dna, even the specific er/ere interactions can be competed. there is a shift of about
tenfold for a 1000-fold excess of unlabeled nonspecific dna, indicating that the specificity ratio
for the er/ere interaction is about 100 under
these conditions. more interestingly, in the presence of these high concentrations of non-specific
dna, the final anisotropy plateau value decreases
almost to the level of that observed in the absence
of ligand. this result demonstrates that er
molecules that participate in the complex in the
presence of ici partition off to bind to non-specific
dna if enough of the competitor is present.
to further characterize the differences in binding
properties of the ers to the ere in the absence and
in the presence of ici, fluorescence-detected gel
mobility-shift assays (gmsa) were carried out
using the 50 -fluorescein-labeled target oligonucleotide (f-vitere) under conditions similar to those

84

with f-vitere. the concentration of erb is either
200 nm (lanes 2 and 3) or 400 nm (lanes 4 and 5). the
concentration of f-vitere was kept at the constant
value of 20 nm. ici at 2.5 mm was added only in lanes 3
and 5. the conditions were as described in materials
and methods.

used in the anisotropy assays. for detection purposes, the concentration of dna was increased to
20 nm, and gels were run in the absence and in
the presence of ici using 200 nm or 400 nm erb.
as can be seen in figure 5, in the absence of ligand,
both at 200 nm and 400 nm erb (lanes 2 and 4), a
shifted complex is observed, along with a decrease
in the intensity of the band corresponding to free
ere, a decrease that is more apparent at the higher
concentration of protein, as expected. we note that
the overall apparent affinity appeared a bit lower
in the gel compared to the anisotropy assays, but
this may arise from the non-equilibrium nature of
the gel. in the presence of ici, at 200 nm erb
(lane 3), the intensity of the band corresponding
to free target ere remained essentially constant
compared to that observed in the absence of ligand
(lane 2), (and significantly weaker than in the
absence of protein), indicating that the dna
remains bound to the er under these conditions.
however, the intensity of the complex band diminished. at 400 nm erb (lane 5), this effect is even
more apparent. the shifted band disappears completely, while the free dna band (as in the absence
of ligand, lane 4) is barely visible. these observations indicate that in the presence of ici, a
complex forms that exhibits characteristics in the
gmsa that are distinct from those observed in the
absence of ici. over-exposure of the gels indicated
a large degree of fluorescence present in the wells
corresponding to the samples in the presence of
ici, suggesting that the complex does not enter
the gel in the presence of this ligand. similar
results were obtained for era (data not shown).
such behavior is consistent with the formation of
complexes containing more than one er dimer in
the presence of ici. a similar gmsa result in the
presence of a different ici ligand was observed by
fawell and co-workers26 for era in presence of
 xxxd576xxx , but the disappearance of the shifted
band was interpreted in that study as indicative
of the dissociation of the er dimer. indeed, since
these earlier assays were carried out in the
presence of a large excess of target dna, the for-

western blot analysis was performed, as described in
materials and methods, using whole-cell extracts from
untreated (c) or ici-treated hela cells stably transfected
with era or erb expression vectors. membranes were
probed with specific antibodies for each receptor. actin
detection was used to verified gel loading.

mation of protein– dna complexes by observation
of the disappearance of the free dna was not possible. in our case, the target dna was limiting
and the loss of the free dna band in the presence
of ici is quite obvious, consistent with the formation of an erb – ere complex with properties,
as concerns migration in the gel, quite different
from those of the complex observed in the absence
of ligand. the fluorescence detected in the wells of
the lanes for reaction mixtures containing ici in
the present experiments points to the formation of
protein– dna complexes of higher order than
dimer.
er –ere complexes containing more than one
er dimer and presenting modified gmsa properties are observed for both era and erb in presence
of ici, but the anisotropy experiments provide no
structural information about these complexes. the
anisotropy difference observed for era binding to
the ere in the presence of ici is slightly larger
than that observed for erb, but it is not clear
whether this results from significant differences in
complex structure, dynamics or stoichiometry.
differences in the proteolytic cleavage patterns
have been reported for era and erb in the
presence of  xxxd576xxx  and  xxxd2165xxx ,780.27 we were
interested to determine whether the consequences
of ici binding in vivo were similar for the two
receptor subtypes. to this end, we measured the
accumulation of era and erb in hela cells either
in absence of ligand or stimulated for 24 hours by
ici using antibodies specific to era and erb.
figure 6 clearly demonstrates that the previously
reported decrease in era stability in vivo in the
presence of ici28 is not observed here for erb.
thus, although ici leads to similar effects in terms
of dna binding in vitro, the consequences in vivo
of ici binding to the two receptors appear quite
distinct.

role of agonist structure and receptor subtype
in the recruitment of the coactivator  xxxg1510xxx 
the efficiency of er agonists depends, in part,
on their affinity for the receptor, and on the ability
of the agonist, once bound, to induce the active
conformation of the receptor, in particular as
regards recruitment of the coactivator proteins,
such as  xxxg1510xxx . in order to examine this latter

previously, by observing the increase in anisotropy
of the a488src-1570 – 780 as a function of increasing
concentration of er. all ligands were present in
concentrations (5 –10 mm) sufficient to saturate the
er at the highest concentrations of protein used,

a
kd values for the agonist ligands were taken from kuiper &
gustafsson.54

and were thus all present at concentrations well
above their kd for binding to the er. no interaction
between either er subtype and  xxxg1510xxx  over the
concentration ranges tested was observed in the
absence of ligand (data not shown).
in figure 7(a) and (b) are shown the binding
profiles of  xxxg1510xxx  to era and erb, respectively, in
the presence of the various agonists tested. the
data were fit to a simple model of one er dimer
binding to one  xxxg1510xxx  monomer, as we have determined previously,20 and the values of the recovered
dissociation constants are given in table 3. it can be
seen from the figures that the effectiveness of the
different agonists in  xxxg1510xxx  recruitment varies by
between one and two orders of magnitude both
for era and erb. moreover, as is highlighted in
figure 7(c) and (d), estrone and gen are much
more efficient for recruiting  xxxg1510xxx  to erb than to
era. the effect is similar, but less pronounced for
 xxxd2054xxx . it is interesting to note that the capacity for
coactivator recruitment is not correlated with the
affinity of the ligand for the receptor subtype
(table 3).
no evidence for cooperative binding was
apparent in the er/ xxxg1510xxx  titrations. in contrast,
the dna-binding profiles presented above demonstrated that er undergoes a monomer – dimer
equilibrium in the concentration range below
10 nm. the apparent lack of cooperativity in a
concentration range over which dimerization
occurs can arise from non-equivalence of the

86

 xxxg1510xxx  binding sites for er. indeed, the sequences
of both the lxxll motifs and the flanking
sequences for the three nr boxes contained in our
 xxxg1510xxx  fragment are not identical. moreover, certain
receptors exhibit preferences for particular lxxll
motifs, and the sequences flanking these motifs
can play a role in target recognition.29 thus the
binding of the second er monomer to  xxxg1510xxx 
(equivalent to the binding of the second er monomer to a dna target with two half sites) could
conceivably be less energetically favorable than
the binding of the first monomer. this type of
behavior (apparent loss of cooperativity) has
been observed for er/ere interactions with nonequivalent dna target half sites.19

discussion
the dna binding properties of era and erb
are quite similar, as was expected given the
high degree of sequence identity of their dbds,
although the overall affinity of erb was slightly
lower than that observed for era. a difference in
the quality of the preparations (as concerns dnabinding activity) cannot be ruled out, although the
ligand-binding activity of the preparations was
nearly identical and different lots of receptor
preparations typically yield quite similar results.
a higher affinity of era for the palindromic ere
compared to erb has been reported.30 – 32 interestingly, it has been reported that both er subtypes
bend their target sequences, era more than erb.33
these differences in structure could be linked to
the observed differences in affinity between the
two er subtypes.
both er subtypes exhibit variations in the
affinity and the stoichiometry of dna binding
with changing solution conditions. thus, increasing the salt concentration expectedly diminishes
the affinity of the interaction, but also tends to
decrease the population of complexes of higher
order than dimer. moreover, under salt conditions
in which residual higher-order species are populated (150 mm kcl), decreasing the temperature
from 21 8c to 4 8c tends to disfavor these higherorder species, without affecting the midpoint of
binding.
agonist and antagonist ligands affected the
dna-binding properties of era and erb differently. agonists had no effect on the era/ere
interaction, whereas they promoted the formation
of higher-order complexes at the high concentration end of the titration profiles of the ere with
erb.  xxxd3285xxx  had subtle effects on both subtypes,
increasing the cooperativity in the case of era
and decreasing the affinity while increasing the
high-concentration anisotropy plateau in the case
of erb. among all the ligands tested, the pure
antagonist ici exhibited the most significant effect
on the interaction of both er subtypes with the
ere. in the presence of this ligand, both era and
erb bound highly cooperatively as complexes of

 xxxg730xxx  interactions

higher order than dimer. we fit these curves
according to a tetramer-ere model, but er-ere
complexes containing even more than two er
dimers are possible. while parker and co-workers26
suggested that ici leads to dissociation of the er
dimer and the consequent loss of affinity for the
ere, metzger and co-workers34 reported no hindrance of either dimerization or er/dna interactions by ici. our gmsas, in addition to the
anisotropy assays indicate that rather than dimer
(and hence dna) dissociation, ici leads to the formation of protein –dna complexes involving at
least two er dimers. the length of our fluorescent
target ere (32 bp) could permit a second dimer to
bind to the opposite face of the dna relative to
the first, although in this case the er – ere contacts
would be non-specific in nature. given the apparent cooperativity of the interaction, it is highly
probable that these er – ere complexes containing
more than one er dimer implicate direct protein –
protein contacts. however, direct interaction
between er in these higher-order protein –dna
complexes does not rule out non-specific interactions between the additional er dimer(s) and
dna.
our studies demonstrate that the formation of
these higher-order er – ere complexes can be
modulated by (obviously) the concentration of
receptor, the concentration of non-specific dna,
temperature, salt and ligands. that ligands such
as ici favor the formation of these complexes
implicates the lbd. on the basis of the available
structures of the er lbd (e.g. figure 8(a)), the
structural basis for the formation of higher-order
er – ere species cannot be predicted with any certainty. as noted above, these higher-order protein –dna complexes could involve protein –dna
interactions, protein– protein interactions, or both.
moreover, they could be structurally distinct
depending upon the conditions under which they
are observed. the orientation of the activation
helix 12 varies significantly among the various
structures.35,36 in the presence of agonist, helix 12
closes over the ligand-binding pocket creating a
hydrophobic pocket for the binding of the nr
interacting domains of the coactivator proteins
(figure 8(a)),37 – 40 whereas in presence of antagonists such as raloxifene35 or oht41 (figure 8(b)), the
bulky tail of the ligand protrudes from the ligandbinding pocket, preventing correct placement of
helix 12 for coactivator recruitment (figure 8(b)).
it is noteworthy that the structure of erb lbd
with  xxxd576xxx  (the structure of which is very
similar to that of  xxxd2165xxx ,780) revealed that this
antagonist has a considerable effect on the structure of the erb lbd.42 remarkably, no electron
density for helix 12 is visible in the electron density
maps for this complex. in addition to disordering
the activation helix 12, ici had profound effects
on the interface for dimerization, which is significantly more open in presence of the antagonist
than in any other er lbd structure. compared to
the conformation observed with the antagonist,

distance between the hydrogen
atom of the oh group in 17b and
the heterocycle nitrogen atom of
his524 from 2.8 å to 3.6 å.

raloxifene
for
example,
brzozowski
and
co-workers noted a large shift (3 – 4 å) and a 148
rotation of one monomer in relation to its partner,
which reduces the overall buried surface area in
the dimer from 15% to 10%.35 moreover, over
900 å2 of surface is involved in interactions
between adjacent molecules in the lattice. this
interaction surface is nearly equivalent to the
dimer interface. these observations are consistent
with altered protein –protein interactions as the
basis for the effect reported here of ici on the
stoichiometry of the er – ere complexes.
the formation of complexes of higher order than
dimer is not unusual for nr proteins. for example,
 xxxg1998xxx  exists as a tetramer in the absence of ligand
and the oligomeric state of the protein regulates
dna binding.43 – 45 the difference in protein –dna
complex stoichiometry in the case of er/ere
interactions induced by ici could be implicated
in the full (af1 þ af2) antagonist properties of
the ici compounds. these effects could be fairly
indirect. the fivefold increase in era turnover in
the presence of ici 164,38428 could result from
changes in receptor conformation and oligomerization induced by the ligand that we have observed
in the present binding experiments. however,
despite similarities in the in vitro behavior of era
and erb in the presence of ici, the fate of the
antagonist-bound receptors in vivo is quite different. either the ici-induced conformational

changes are distinct for the two receptors, or the
difference in the primary sequence of the receptors
leads to different consequences resulting from the
change in conformation. significant and distinct
changes in proteolytic digestion patterns were
observed for the two er subtypes in the presence
of  xxxd576xxx  and  xxxd2165xxx ,780.27 more generally,
allosteric linkages between the er dbd (dnabinding) and the lbd (ligand and cofactorbinding) have been reported in a number of recent
studies. for example, the extent of era/tif-2
interaction was shown to depend upon the
er – ere affinity.32 hall and co-workers demonstrated that the activity of several er ligands was
influenced significantly by the nature of the
response element, and that this latter regulates the
structure of the coactivator pocket.46 the present
dna-binding studies of era and erb in the
presence of various ligands provide further
evidence for allosteric communication between the
dbd and lbd of these receptors. in addition, our
results reveal that these allosteric effects involve
changes in er subunit interactions.
in the present study we have examined the
differential effects of er agonists on the capacity
for recruiting the coactivator  xxxg1510xxx . we have
shown that the agonists gen and estrone recruit
 xxxg1510xxx  more efficiently to erb than to era,
although, comparatively, gen is much more
efficient that estrone for either subtype. differential

88

effects of ligands on coactivator recruitment by the
two er subtypes has been reported,47 although no
binding constants were determined in this case,
since the gst pulldown assays were carried out at
a single concentration of receptor and coactivator
using increasing concentrations of ligand. in the
present case, we have examined these interactions
under conditions of saturating ligand, a low concentration of the target  xxxg1510xxx  and increasing receptor concentration, in order to determine the binding
constants under true equilibrium conditions.
the structural basis for the observed varying
efficiency of the different agonists tested for coactivator recruitment must be understood both within
a receptor subtype and comparatively for the
two subtypes. in the case of distinct recruitment
capacity within a receptor subtype, we found that
estradiol and estriol both exhibit high ligandbinding affinity and reasonable effectiveness in
coactivator recruitment for both receptor subtypes.
in the case of estrone, which binds with high affinity to both receptor subtypes, the capacity for
coactivator recruitment is, in contrast, quite low
for both era and erb. the planar carbonyl group
at position 17 would not necessarily diminish the
affinity (no steric clashes for example), yet would
not allow for the hydrogen bond that exists
between the hydroxyl group present in that
position in estradiol and one of the nitrogen atoms
of the heterocycle of histidine 524 located at the
back of the ligand-binding pocket. a second
hydrogen bond between the other heterocycle
nitrogen atom (which acts as an acceptor to the
main-chain carbonyl group of glu419 situated in
the loop between the b-hairpin and helix 4)
ensures the correct positioning of his524. this residue lies at the end of helix 11 and is key for the
orientation of the coactivator helix 12 (figure 8(a)
and (b)) through a network of hydrophobic
contacts involving met528, val533, val534 and
leu544.  xxxd2054xxx  exhibits diminished capacity for
coactivator recruitment. in this complex, the
hydrogen bond between the hydroxyl group in
17b of  xxxd2054xxx  and the ring nitrogen atom of his524 is
likely to be perturbed compared to estradiol, since
the ethynyl group in 17a creates steric hindrance
around met343. we modeled the erlbd –  xxxd2054xxx 
complex using the structure of the estradiol-bound
lbd (1ere35) as a template and the minimization
algorithm of the program cns.48 results of this
modeling suggest that the hydroxyl group in 17b
is pushed downward with respect to the situation
with estradiol, thus increasing the distance
between the hydroxyl group and the ring nitrogen
atom of his524 by nearly an angström unit
(2.8 – 3.6 å), either weakening, or more likely,
abrogating the hydrogen bond (figure 8(c)). the
weakening or disruption of the hydrogen
bond anchoring his524 could compromise the
positioning of helix 12, thus affecting coactivator
recruitment.
estrone and gen both exhibit subtype selectivity in their capacity for coactivator recruitment,

 xxxg730xxx  interactions

with a significantly higher efficiency in the case
of erb. pike and co-workers49 point out that the
volume of the ligand-binding cavity in erb is significantly smaller than that of era due to the
substitution of a leucine residue by methionine
(at position 384 in era), which reduces the size of
the cavity above the ligand. the gen ligand is
oriented such that the hydrogen bond between the
17b hydroxyl group of estradiol and the ring nitrogen atom of his524 (equivalent position: his475 in
erb) is conserved through the hydroxyl group
in position 2 of gen. in addition, the length of the
gen ligand is somewhat longer than that of
estradiol. thus, it fits very snugly into the ligandbinding pocket of erb, pushing the back of the
pocket a bit, compared to estradiol. this tight fit
may allow for a more effective agonist-induced
conformational change, resulting in more efficient
coactivator recruitment. in the case of estrone,
the smaller cavity may allow for somewhat more
efficient positioning of his475 in erb, although
the capacity for recruitment of coactivator is
relatively low, in the case of this ligand, for both
subtypes. altogether, our data underline the subtle
role of the nr ligands on the switch from inactive
to active conformations of the receptor. rather
than the classic view of the ligand-induced
positioning of  xxxg1956xxx  in two (active/inactive) conformations, helix 12 appears to be able to oscillate in a
dynamic manner, and the role of the ligand is to
stabilize it more or less in one of these conformations. this mechanism accounts for example
for the era agonist/erb antagonist character of
the thc ligand as shown by shiau et al. in a recent
crystallographic study.19 on one hand, thc is able
to stabilize the active conformation of era lbd by
establishing a hydrogen bond with his524. on the
other hand, a slightly different positioning of this
ligand in the erb ligand-binding pocket precludes
this interaction, thus disordering the h11 –  xxxg1956xxx 
loop and shifting the  xxxg1956xxx  to an inactive conformation. but by pushing the equilibrium with a
high concentration of receptor, they show that
this “passive” antagonist character of thc can be
reversed, since the interaction between erb and a
coactivator peptide can occur with low affinity.
these results are consistent with our study and
point out the role of this dynamic positioning of
 xxxg1956xxx , providing clues for the understanding of the
function of “partial” agonists, which are unable to
promote by themselves an active conformation
of the receptor, but may become agonists under
particular cellular conditions.

conclusions
the present studies have allowed for a relatively
precise, quantitative characterization of the interactions of the two receptor subtypes, era and
erb, with dna and coactivator, and the effects
of salt, temperature and ligand structure on
the coupled protein– protein and protein –dna

89

 xxxg730xxx  interactions

interactions in these systems. subtle and more
drastic differences in protein– protein interactions
have been revealed. they indicate coupling
between the ligand-binding and the dna-binding
properties of the receptors and suggest that the
regulation of receptor function is very complex,
involving differences in both affinity and stoichiometry. distinct behavior of the receptor subtypes
as regards these coupled protein – protein interactions can be interpreted thanks to the known
structures of the ligands and the proteins involved,
and they provide insight into the mechanisms of
action of er agonists and antagonists with regards
to the two receptors. although direct connections
to receptor function in vivo are difficult to establish,
these quantitative studies in vitro allow the evaluation of the energetic consequences of changing
solution conditions and differences in the chemical
structure of the proteins and ligands. such information is key to establishing structure–function
relationships and in the structure-based development of therapeutic strategies.

from pgex2tk-src-1570 – 780 and subcloned into bam hi/
sma i-digested pqe-30 (qiagen) to generate the pqe30src-1570 – 780 plasmid. the his-tagged scr-1570 – 780 was
over-expressed in escherichia coli and purified by ni2þnta agarose beads under native conditions (qiagencourtaboeuf-f). alexa 488 protein labeling kits were
purchased from molecular probes (eugene, or). the
protein was dialyzed into 20 mm potassium phosphate
(ph 7.5), 150 mm nacl. the ph was then adjusted to
8.0 using 1 m sodium bicarbonate and a tenfold excess
of the alexa succinimidyl ester was added. labeling
was allowed to proceed for one hour at room temperature with agitation. the reaction was quenched with
10% (v/v) hydroxylamine. free dye was separated from
the protein using a g-25 superfine gel-filtration column
and the absence of free dye was verified by tlc. the
labeling ratio, as determined from the extinction
coefficient of the dye (90,000 cm21 m21 at 488 nm) and
a bradford analysis of the protein concentration was,
on average, one label per  xxxg1510xxx  molecule, and labeling
was carried out under conditions (ph , 8.3) under
which only the amino terminus exhibits significant
reactivity.
hplc-purified oligonucleotides were purchased from
genosys (montigny le bretonneux) for the f-vitere
and from eurogentec (seraing, belgium) for the
vitere-f5. the target sequence, referred to here as ere,

the buffer solution for all fluorescence measurements
was 20 mm tris – hcl (ph 7.5), 1 mm edta, 1 mm dtt
and 10% (v/v) glycerol (tegd) at the indicated concentration of kcl and temperature. binding assays were performed using a beacon 2000 polarization instrument
(panvera, corp., madison wi) regulated at the chosen
temperature, using filters for fluorescein at a f-vitere
or a488src-1570 – 780 concentration of 1.0 nm. anisotropy
was measured successively until stabilized, and the
reported values are the average of five to eight measurements after stabilization.
gel mobility-shift assays
the buffer solution used for this assay was 20 mm
tris – hcl (ph 7.5), 150 mm nacl, 1 mm edta, 1 mm
dtt, 10% (v/v) glycerol. f-vit ere at 20 nm was incubated with erb at both concentrations of 200 nm and
400 nm, and at a saturating amount of ligand ici
(2.5 mm). incubation was done for 15 – 30 minutes at
4 8c. the total volume of the reaction mix was 14 ml.
the protein – dna complex was resolved on nondenaturing 6% polyacrylamide gel in 0.5 £ tbe buffer
for one hour at 4 8c (pre-run for 15 minutes at 150 v,
4 8c) and the gel was scanned with a fluorimager.
western blot analysis
hela cells50 stably transfected with era or erb
expression vector were treated or not with ici for 24
hours. whole-cell extracts were then prepared in ripa
buffer containing 150 mm nacl, 50 mm tris (ph 7.5),
5 mm na2edta, 0.5% (v/v) np40, 0.5% (w/v) sodium
 xxxd1835xxx , 0.1% (w/v) sds, 1 mm dithiothreitol and
proteases inhibitors. proteins were quantified using the
bradford assay (bio-rad laboratories, marnes, france)
and 40 mg was analysed by western blot. the membranes were saturated in tbst buffer (50 mm tris,
150 mm nacl, 0.1% (v/v) tween 20, 5% (w/v) dehydrated milk), incubated with specific primary antibodies

data analysis
binding data were analyzed using bioeqs.51 – 53 for
the dna-binding profiles, we used a model in which
two monomers can bind cooperatively to the oligonucleotide, with the exception of the titrations performed
in the presence of ici, for which the model included, in
addition to the dimer– dna complex, binding of a
second dimer. the free energies correspond to the free
energies of formation of the complexes directly from the
free monomeric protein and free dna such that  xxxg660xxx 
corresponds to the free energy of formation of the monomer-bound dna, dg2 corresponds to the free energy of
formation of the dimer bound dna complex and, in the
case of ici, dg3 corresponds to the free energy of
formation of the tetramer-bound dna complex again
from free monomer and free dna. the cooperativity of
the dimer binding is calculated as:
dg2 2 2dg1
the value of the intermediate monomer-bound dna
anisotropy was fixed in the fit. modifying this value had
little effect on the recovered free energies, but fixing
it was necessary in order to constrain it to a positive,
physically reasonable value. confidence limits on the
recovered free energy values were estimated using
rigorous confidence limit testing in which, for a range of
possible values of the recovered free energy, a complete
minimization was performed and the 67% confidence
level was determined from the f-statistic using the x2
and the degrees of freedom for the fit. this approach
has the advantage of taking into account uncertainties
arising from parameter correlations.
the binding of era and erb to the a488src-1570 – 780
was analyzed according to a simple model of er dimers
binding to the labeled protein. this is because no
cooperativity was apparent from the curves. a model
based on two monomers binding would have yielded
two equivalent free energies, and thus the simpler
dimer binding model was preferred.
