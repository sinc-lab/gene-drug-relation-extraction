abstract
mammalian type i and ii  xxxg930xxx  (gnrh)
receptors (gnrhrs) show differential ligand preference for
 xxxd2226xxx  and gnrh-ii, respectively. using a variety of chimeric
receptors based on green monkey  xxxg931xxx -2 (gmgnrhr-2), a
representative type ii  xxxg931xxx , and rat  xxxg931xxx , a representative
type i  xxxg931xxx , this study elucidated specific domains responsible
for this ligand selectivity. a chimeric gmgnrhr-2 with the extracellular loop 3 (el3) and el3-proximal transmembrane helix 7
(tmh7) of rat  xxxg931xxx  showed a great increase in ligand sensitivity
to  xxxd2226xxx  but not to gnrh-ii. point-mutation studies indicate that
four amino acids, leu/phe7.38, leu/phe7.43, ala/pro7.46, and pro/
cys7.47 in tmh7 are critical for ligand selectivity as well as receptor conformation. furthermore, a combinatory mutation (pro7.31-

the most extensively studied receptors because of its dual
significance both for understanding reproductive biology and
for the development of medical therapies (sealfon et al.,
1997). it is now well-established that most vertebrates, including human, have at least two forms of gnrh (white et
al., 1998; fernald and white, 1999). one form,  xxxd2226xxx  (also

positions 7 and 8 of gnrhs are more important than position 5 for
differential recognition by type i and type ii gnrhrs. as a whole,
these data suggest a molecular coevolution of ligands and their
receptors and facilitate the understanding of the molecular interaction between gnrhs and their cognate receptors.

called  xxxd2226xxx ), is primarily synthesized in the
hypothalamus, whereas the other form, gnrh-ii (also called
chicken gnrh-ii), is widely expressed in the brain and peripheral tissues. although  xxxd2226xxx  is known to regulate the
secretion and synthesis of gonadotropins in the pituitary, the
exact function of gnrh-ii is largely unknown. the receptor
for  xxxd2226xxx  was first isolated from mammalian pituitary cells
(kaiser et al., 1992; reinhart et al., 1992; tsutsumi et al.,
1992) and called mammalian type i  xxxg931xxx . receptors that
have a high affinity for gnrh-ii have been identified in
nonmammalian and mammalian species (tensen et al., 1997;
illing et al., 1999; millar et al., 2001; neill et al., 2001; wang

gnrhrs than mammalian type i  xxxg931xxx . mammalian type ii
 xxxg931xxx , like nonmammalian gnrhrs, contains the intracellular c-terminal tail, which is functionally important for desensitization and internalization (heding et al., 1998; willars et al.,
1999), whereas mammalian type i  xxxg931xxx  does not have a
c-terminal tail. mammalian type ii and nonmammalian
gnrhrs have  xxxg241xxx .50 and asp7.49 in the transmembrane helices (tmhs) 2 and 7, respectively, whereas mammalian type i
gnrhrs contain  xxxg241xxx .50 and asn7.49, which are known to be
important for receptor conformation and signal transduction
(blomenröhr et al., 1997; mitchell et al., 1998).
mammalian type ii  xxxg931xxx  has a higher affinity for
gnrh-ii than for  xxxd2226xxx , whereas the opposite is true for
mammalian type i  xxxg931xxx . however, the factors that determine such differential ligand selectivity are poorly understood. mutagenesis studies combined with computational
modeling have identified a number of residues that are involved in ligand binding (davidson et al., 1996; flanagan et
al., 2000; hoffmann et al., 2000; hövelmann et al., 2002).
gnrh-ii differs from  xxxd2226xxx  by three amino acids at positions 5, 7, and 8; thus, searching for residues that may
interact with them would help us to understand the mechanism underlying differential ligand selectivity. it has been
proposed that tyr5 and  xxxg234xxx  of  xxxd2226xxx  interact with tyr6.58
and  xxxg614xxx .64 of mammalian type i  xxxg931xxx  (hövelmann et al.,
2002). however, because tyr6.58 and  xxxg614xxx .64 are also conserved in mammalian type ii  xxxg931xxx , these residues alone
cannot account for differential ligand selectivity. an acidic
amino acid, glu/asp7.32 in el3 of mammalian type i  xxxg931xxx 
is known to confer ligand specificity for  xxxd2226xxx  by an electrostatic interaction with arg8 of  xxxd2226xxx  (flanagan et al.,
1994; fromme et al., 2001). however, this is not fully explanatory, because some nonmammalian gnrhrs have an acidic
amino acid (e.g., glu7.32 for bfgnrhr-2 and asp7.32 for catfish  xxxg931xxx ) at this homologous position, yet these receptors
respond better to gnrh-ii than to  xxxd2226xxx  (wang et al.,
2001). we have demonstrated that the positions of ser and
pro flanking glu/asp7.32 are critical determinants for ligand
selectivity (wang et al., 2004). replacement of the ser-glu-pro
(sep) motif by pro-glu-ser (pes) in mammalian type i  xxxg931xxx 
induced an increased sensitivity to gnrh-ii but the opposite to
 xxxd2226xxx . moreover, mutation of a ser-gln-ser (sqs) motif to
sep in bullfrog type i  xxxg931xxx  (bfgnrhr-1) showed an increased sensitivity to gnrh-ii but a decreased sensitivity to
 xxxd2226xxx  (wang et al., 2004). however, this study found no
reverse-ligand selectivity when the pro-glu-tyr (pey) motif in
bfgnrhr-2 was replaced by sep, suggesting the involvement
of other residues in ligand selectivity.
sequence alignments showed that the el3-proximal
tmh7 of mammalian type ii  xxxg931xxx  has a high degree of
sequence identity with that of nonmammalian gnrhrs but
not with that of mammalian type i  xxxg931xxx . in the present
study, using rat  xxxg931xxx  and gmgnrhr-2 as models for
representative mammalian type i and type ii gnrhrs, respectively, we addressed whether el3 and/or el3-proximal
tmh7 determine differential ligand selectivity. domain
swapping and site-directed mutagenesis studies suggest that
the pro-pro-ser (pps) motif in el3 and  xxxg234xxx .38,  xxxg234xxx .43,
ala7.46, and pro7.47 in tmh7 of gmgnrhr-2 are critical for
discriminating gnrh-ii from  xxxd2226xxx .

materials and methods
materials.  xxxd2226xxx  (pyro-glu-his-trp-ser-tyr-gly-leu-arg-proglynh2), gnrh-ii ([his5, trp7, tyr8] xxxd2226xxx ), [his5] xxxd2226xxx ,
[trp7] xxxd2226xxx , [trp8] xxxd2226xxx , and [trp7, leu8] xxxd2226xxx  were synthesized by anygen (gwangju, korea). the c-fos-luc vector containing
approximately ⫺711 to ⫹45 sequence of the human c-fos promoter
constructed in the pflash vector was a kind gift from dr. r. prywes
(columbia university, new york, ny). vent dna polymerase was
purchased from new england biolabs (beverly, ma). all oligonucleotides were synthesized from genotech (daejon, korea). gh3 cell
lines stably expressing gmgnrhr-2 or rat  xxxg931xxx  were established
as described previously (acharjee et al., 2002; wang et al., 2003).
amino acid residue numbering scheme. amino acid residues are numbered according to their positions in gmgnrhr-2. to
facilitate the comparison among different gnrhrs, the standard
numbering system proposed by ballesteros and weinstein (1995)
was also used.
construction of wild-type and mutant gnrhrs. the cdna
of gmgnrhr-2 subcloned into pcdna3 (invitrogen, carlsbad, ca) at
the kpni and xbai sites (wang et al., 2003) was used as a template
for creating domain-swapped or site-directed mutants. domainswapping and site-directed mutagenesis were performed by the polymerase chain reaction overlapping-extension method (wang et al.,
2003, 2004). to facilitate the construction of domain-swapped mutants, an exogenously introduced ecorv site at the asn7.34 residue
and an intrinsic bstxi site or two intrinsic bamhi sites were used.
el3 or el3-proximal tmh7 of rat  xxxg931xxx  was amplified using a
specific set of primers flanked by the overlapping sequence of gmgnrhr-2 and the appropriate restriction endonuclease recognition site,
producing rel3s and rel3l, respectively. the fragment from the n
terminus to the ecorv site at the asn7.34 residue of rel3s was
replaced by the corresponding fragment of rat  xxxg931xxx , generating
the r6tm chimera. likewise, the fragment from the n terminus to
the bamhi site at the pro7.47 residue of gmgnrhr-2 was replaced
by the corresponding part of rat  xxxg931xxx , producing the r6.5tm
chimera. mutated sequences were confirmed using the sequenase
version 2.0 dna sequencing kit (u.s. biochemical corporation,
cleveland, oh) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
inositol phosphate production assay. the inositol phosphate
(ip) production assay was performed as described previously (wang
et al., 2003). gh3 cells (1 ⫻ 105/well) expressing gmgnrhr-2 or rat
 xxxg931xxx  were seeded in 12-well plates, and the following day, cells
were incubated in inositol-free dmem (invitrogen) containing 2%
dialyzed fetal bovine serum and labeled with 1 ␮ci of [myo-3h]inositol/well (amersham biosciences uk, ltd., little chalfont, buckinghamshire, uk) for 18 h. medium was then removed, and cells were
washed with 0.5 ml of buffer a (140 mm nacl, 20 mm hepes, 4 mm
kcl, 8 mm d-glucose, 1 mm mgcl2, 1 mm cacl2, and 1 mg/ml fatty
acid-free bsa). cells were then preincubated with buffer a containing 10 mm licl for 15 min, followed by treatment with graded
concentrations (0.01 nm to 10 ␮m) of gnrhs at 37°c for 45 min. the
reaction was terminated by removing the incubation medium and
adding 0.5 ml of ice-cold 10 mm  xxxd2154xxx . after 30 min at 4°c, the
 xxxd2154xxx  extracts were transferred into columns containing dowex
anion exchange resin. total ips were then eluted with 1 ml of 1 m
ammonium formate/0.1 m  xxxd2154xxx , and their radioactivity was
determined.
luciferase assay. wild-type and mutant gnrhrs were transiently transfected into cv-1 cells, which were maintained at 37°c in
dmem with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 1 mm glutamate, 100 u of penicillin, and 100 ␮g/ml streptomycin. cells were
seeded in 24-well plates (1 ⫻ 105/well), and transfection was performed using the superfect transfection kit (qiagen, valencia,
ca) according to the manufacturer’s instructions with a minor modification. for each transfection, 100 ng of each receptor cdna, 200 ng
of c-fos-luc vector, and 200 ng of internal control plasmid pcmv␤-gal
were used. one day after transfection, cells were serum-starved for

ligand selectivity of gnrh receptors
24 h and then challenged with gnrh for 6 h (oh et al., 2003). cells
were harvested, and luciferase activity in the cell extract was determined according to standard methods in a lumat lb9501 (berthold
technologies, bad wildbad, germany). the luciferase activities were
normalized using ␤-galactosidase values. transfection experiments
were performed in duplicate and were repeated three to five times.
binding assay. gnrh-ii was radioiodinated using the chloramine-t method and purified by chromatography on a sephadex g-25
(sigma-aldrich, st. louis, mo) column in 0.01 m acetic acid and
0.1% bsa. hela cells were transfected with wild-type, individual
mutant construct, or pcdna3 (300 ng of dna per well in 12-well
plates) with effectene (qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. thirty-six hours after transfection, intact cells were
washed and incubated with binding buffer (dmem supplemented
with 0.1% bsa, ph 7.4) containing 250,000 cpm of 125i-gnrh-ii (0.5
ml final volume) at 20°c for 1 h to achieve equilibrium. specific
binding was calculated by subtracting nonspecific binding (the presence of 10 ␮m unlabeled gnrh-ii) from total binding. for the displacement binding assay, 125i-gnrh-ii was incubated in the presence of graded concentrations of unlabeled  xxxd2226xxx  or gnrh-ii.
molecular modeling. gmgnrhr-2 was built by modeller 6
version 2 (sali and blundell, 1993) on the basis of the crystal structure of bovine rhodopsin (okada et al., 2002) as a template.  xxxd2226xxx 
or gnrh-ii was docked onto putative binding sites of gmgnrhr-2
manually using visual molecular dynamics (humphrey et al., 1996):
pyroglu1 with asn5.39, his2 with  xxxg241xxx .61, trp3 with asn6.48, tyr5
with tyr6.58, and gly10 with  xxxg241xxx .61 and asn2.65. the models for
gmgnrhr-2/gnrh-ii, mutant gmgnrhr-2/ xxxd2226xxx , and mutant
gmgnrhr-2/gnrh-ii were built by mutating corresponding residues in the gmgnrhr-2/ xxxd2226xxx  model and underwent energy minimization and molecular dynamics annealing simulations in the
modeller. the final models showing good geometry were confirmed by procheck (laskowski et al., 1993). the contacts between ligands and receptors were analyzed using ligplot (wallace et
al., 1995). figures of the models were drawn using visual molecular
dynamics (humphrey et al., 1996).
data analysis. analyses were performed using nonlinear regression, and the data were expressed as sigmoid dose-response curves.
gnrh concentrations inducing half-maximal stimulation (ec50), halfmaximal inhibition (ic50), and maximal fold increases (emax) were
calculated using graphpad prism 3 software (graphpad software inc.,
san diego, ca). all data are presented as means ⫾ s.e.m. the data

were analyzed by one-way analysis of variance followed by the bonferroni test. a p value ⬍0.05 was considered statistically significant.

results
differential ligand selectivity of mammalian and
nonmammalian gnrhrs. the ligand selectivities of rat
 xxxg931xxx  and gmgnrhr-2 were examined using two different
methods: ip production, and c-fos promoter-driven luciferase
(c-fos-luc) assays. for the ip assay, gh3 cells stably expressing rat  xxxg931xxx  or gmgnrhr-2 were used (wang et al., 2003;
maiti et al., 2003), and for c-fos-luc assay, cv-1 cells transiently expressing rat  xxxg931xxx  or gmgnrhr-2 were used. as
for rat  xxxg931xxx ,  xxxd2226xxx  showed a lower ec50 value than did
gnrh-ii, indicating that rat  xxxg931xxx  has a higher sensitivity
to  xxxd2226xxx  than to gnrh-ii. however, gmgnrhr-2 responded better to gnrh-ii than did  xxxd2226xxx  in both assay
systems (fig. 1 and table 1). regarding  xxxg931xxx ,  xxxd2226xxx 
had a 7.4- and 5.9-fold higher potency than gnrh-ii in ip
and c-fos-luc assay systems, respectively. for gmgnrhr-2,
gnrh-ii was 204-fold (ip assay) and 239-fold (c-fos-luc assay) more potent than  xxxd2226xxx  (table 1). because c-fos-luc
was more sensitive than the ip assay system, we used the
c-fos-luc system in ensuing experiments.
el3 and el3-proximal tmh7 are involved in differential ligand selectivity. sequence alignment showed
that el3-proximal tmh7 of mammalian type ii  xxxg931xxx  has
a high degree of sequence identity with that of nonmammalian gnrhrs but not mammalian type i  xxxg931xxx . furthermore, it was suggested that the proximal region of tmh7 of
 xxxg931xxx  affects the conformation of el3 (petry et al., 2002).
we therefore presumed that both el3 and the el3-proximal
tmh7 may be involved in differential ligand selectivity. to
address this possibility, el3 alone or together with el3proximal tmh7 of gmgnrhr-2 was swapped with that of rat
 xxxg931xxx , designated rel3s or rel3l, respectively. swapping
el3 alone did not induce a significant change in sensitivity
for either  xxxd2226xxx  or gnrh-ii such that chimeric rel3s, like
fig. 1. ligand selectivity of rat  xxxg931xxx  or
gmgnrhr-2. a, ip assays were performed
using gh3 cells which stably express rat
 xxxg931xxx  (rat) or gmgnrhr-2 (gm2). cells
were treated with increasing concentrations of  xxxd2226xxx  or gnrh-ii for 30 min. b,
c-fos-luc activity was examined in cv-1
cells that were cotransfected with 200 ng of
c-fos-luc reporter vector plus rat  xxxg931xxx  or
gmgnrhr-2. twenty-four hours after
transfection, cells were serum-starved for
18 h and then treated for 6 h with  xxxd2226xxx 
or gnrh-ii. cell lysates were used for luciferase assays. broken lines are dose-responses of rat (e) and gm2 (f) to  xxxd2226xxx ,
and solid lines are dose-responses of rat (䡺)
and gm2 (f) to gnrh-ii.

ligand selectivity of gnrh receptors

wild-type gmgnrhr-2, showed a higher sensitivity to
gnrh-ii than to  xxxd2226xxx  (fig. 2a). it is interesting that
rel3l showed a great increase in sensitivity to  xxxd2226xxx  but
not to gnrh-ii (fig. 2b and table 2), indicating that el3proximal tmh7 in gmgnrhr-2 is probably important for
the discrimination between them. the functional importance
of el3-proximal tmh7 was further confirmed by additional
chimeric receptors that have n termini to el3 or to el3proxmial tmh7 of rat  xxxg931xxx , denoted r6tm or r6.5tm,
respectively. the chimeric receptor r6tm, which has the
el3-proximal tmh7 sequence of gmgnrhr-2, has a high
sensitivity to gnrh-ii and a low sensitivity to  xxxd2226xxx , characteristics of a type ii receptor (fig. 2c). in contrast, r6.5tm
containing the el3-proximal tmh7 sequence of rat  xxxg931xxx 
has the ligand sensitivity, characteristic of a type i  xxxg931xxx 
(fig. 2d), again confirming that el3-proximal tmh7 in
gmgnrhr-2 is critical for ligand selectivity.
identification of rel3l amino acids involved in ligand selectivity. because sequence alignment showed a six
amino acid difference in el3-proximal tmh7 between
gmgnrhr-2 and rat  xxxg931xxx  (fig. 2e), we postulated that
one of them may be responsible for ligand selectivity. thus,
six individual amino acids were reciprocally changed in the
rel3l chimeric receptor. point mutation of phe7.37 to isoleucine, phe7.38 to leucine, or ala7.42 to glycine did not induce
significant changes in ligand selectivity compared with
rel3l (fig. 3, a and b, and table 2). point mutation of
pro7.46 to alanine or cys7.47 to proline completely suppressed
receptor function in response to either  xxxd2226xxx  or gnrh-ii
(fig. 3, c and d). finally, the mutation of phe7.43 to leucine
in rel3l showed a significant decrease in sensitivity to
 xxxd2226xxx  (fig. 3a).

1103

it was shown previously that glu7.32 of mouse  xxxg931xxx  is a
critical residue conferring ligand specificity for arg8 of
 xxxd2226xxx  (flanagan et al., 1994). furthermore, we recently
demonstrated that the positions of serine and proline flanking glu7.32 are crucial for the ligand selectivity between
mammalian and nonmammalian gnrhrs (wang et al.,
2004). therefore, we sought to determine whether these
amino acids are critical for the ligand selectivity in the chimeric receptor rel3l. the glu7.32 or sep motif in rel3l
was changed to glycine or pps, respectively. a mutation of
glu7.32 to glycine significantly decreased sensitivity to
 xxxd2226xxx  but not to gnrh-ii (fig. 3, c and d, and table 2).
moreover, replacement of the sep motif by pps greatly increased sensitivity to gnrh-ii, whereas it slightly decreased
sensitivity to  xxxd2226xxx  (fig. 3, c and d, and table 2). these
results suggest that the sep/pps motif, together with amino
acids in tmh7, is important in ligand sensitivity.
identification of amino acids in wild-type
gmgnrhr-2 that confer differential ligand selectivity. because we observed that the amino acid residues
phe7.43, pro7.46, and cys7.47 in rel3l critically affected receptor activation and ligand selectivity, we further examined
the function of these residues in wild-type gmgnrhr-2. two
mutants, l7.43f and a7.46p, had no receptor activity (fig. 4).
the mutant p7.47c had essentially the same ligand selectivity as the wild-type gmgnrhr-2 (fig. 4). because we failed
to observe reverse-ligand selectivity by a single mutation, we
postulated that multiple amino acids are involved in ligand
selectivity. to address this, double or triple mutants with
different combinations of  xxxg234xxx .43, ala7.46, and pro7.47 were
constructed. it is interesting that a double mutant, a7.46p/
p7.47c, exhibited an improvement in ligand selectivity for

a7.46p/p7.47c mutant showed a ⬃200-fold increased sensitivity to  xxxd2226xxx  and a ⬃20-fold increased sensitivity to
gnrh-ii (fig. 5, a and b).
because the pps/sep motif in el3 and  xxxg234xxx .43, ala7.46,
and pro7.47 residues in tmh7 affect ligand selectivity, we
examined a combinatory effect of these two motifs. the
gmgnrhr-2 with sep/l7.43f/a7.46p/p7.47c mutation revealed a slight decrease in sensitivity for both  xxxd2226xxx  and
gnrh-ii (fig. 5, c and d). this mutant also showed a decrease in emax values for both gnrhs compared with the
l7.43f/a7.46p/p7.47c mutant, which may be caused by low
receptor expression (table 2). it is interesting that additional
mutations rel3s/l7.43f/a7.46p/p7.47c (fig. 7b), sep/i7.37f/
l.38f/l.43f/a7.46p/p7.47c (fig. 5, c and d), or sep/l7.38f/
l7.43f/a7.46p/p7.47c (fig. 5, c and d) increased sensitivity to
 xxxd2226xxx  and decreased sensitivity to gnrh-ii (table 2).
ligand binding affinities. ligand affinities of wildtype, rel3l, and sep/l7.38f/l7.43f/a7.46p/p7.47c mutants
were determined using a competition binding assay. for the
binding assay, hela cells were used because when transfected with the receptors, they have a much higher binding
capacity than cv-1 cells. it should be noted that hela cells,
in the c-fos-luc assay system, produce ec50 values similar to
those of cv-1 cells when we applied the same receptor and
ligand (data not shown). hela cells, however, have a high
basal c-fos-luc activity; therefore, their fold increases are
usually much lower than those in cv-1 cells (oh et al., 2003).
[125i]gnrh-ii (250,000 cpm) was applied to hela cells expressing wild-type and mutant receptors in the presence of
graded concentrations of unlabeled  xxxd2226xxx  or gnrh-ii. log
ic50 values for  xxxd2226xxx  in cells expressing rel3l (⫺7.87 ⫾
0.22) and sep/l7.38f/l7.43f/a7.46p/p7.47c (⫺8.30 ⫾ 0.11) were
significantly lower compared with those in cells expressing the
wild-type receptor (⫺6.69 ⫾ 0.21) (fig. 6a), indicating an increased affinity for  xxxd2226xxx  in the mutant receptors. log ic50
values for gnrh-ii in cells expressing the wild-type, rel3l,
and sep/l7.38f/l7.43f/a7.46p/p7.47c mutants were ⫺9.58 ⫾
0.27, ⫺10.19 ⫾ 0.23, and ⫺9.96 ⫾ 0.27, respectively (fig. 6b),
showing that ligand affinities for gnrh-ii in mutant receptors
do not change as drastically as those for  xxxd2226xxx .
relative ligand binding of mutant constructs was determined using [125i]gnrh-ii in the absence or presence of
unlabeled gnrh-ii (10 ␮m). for wild-type gmgnrhr-2, total and nonspecific binding were 2.3 ⫾ 0.2% (5826 ⫾ 50 cpm)
and 0.60 ⫾ 0.2% (1567 ⫾ 30 cpm), respectively. total binding
for other mutant receptors ranged from 1.16 to 6.83%,
whereas nonspecific bindings for other receptors were the
same as that for the wild-type receptor. mutants that did not
respond to gnrhs (rel3l/p313a, rel3l/c314p, l7.43f, and

a7.46p) were unable to bind radioiodinated gnrh-ii. rel3s,
l7.43f/p7.47c, and sep/l7.43f/a7.46p/p7.47c showed relatively
low binding; rel3l/pps and a7.46p/p7.47c had higher binding
than gmgnrhr-2. other mutants exhibited 49.7 to 178.6%
binding compared with wild-type gmgnrhr-2 (table 2).
ligand sensitivity for chimeric gnrhs. natural and
chimeric gnrhs, in which amino acids at positions 5, 7, and
8 were substituted, were used to examine ligand sensitivity
of gmgnrhr-2, rel3l, and sep/l7.38f/l7.43f/a7.46p/p7.47c
mutants. for wild-type gmgnrhr-2, all chimeric gnrhs
([his5] xxxd2226xxx , [trp7] xxxd2226xxx , [trp8] xxxd2226xxx , and [trp7,
leu8] xxxd2226xxx ) exhibited a higher potency than  xxxd2226xxx  (table 3). in particular, substitution of the amino acid residues
at positions 7 and 8 of  xxxd2226xxx  greatly increased potency to
activate gmgnrhr-2. it should be noted that chimeric ligands [his5] xxxd2226xxx  and [trp7] xxxd2226xxx , which, like  xxxd2226xxx ,
retain arg8, showed a 100- to 200-fold increased potency for
either rel3l or sep/l7.38f/l7.43f/a7.46p/p7.47c that have
enhanced sensitivity to  xxxd2226xxx  (fig. 7 and table 3).
[trp8] xxxd2226xxx  revealed a 20- to 50-fold increased sensitivity
for rel3l and sep/l7.38f/l7.43f/a7.46p/p7.47c compared
with that for wild-type gmgnrhr-2. it is interesting that
rel3l and sep/l7.38f/l7.43f/a7.46p/p7.47c had similar sensitivity to chimeric gnrhs. (fig. 7 and table 3). this result
supports the idea that positions 7 and 8 in gnrh are important for conferring its specificity.
molecular modeling. to support our biochemical data,
we constructed models to simulate the interaction of gnrhs
with wild-type gmgnrhr-2 and sep/l7.38f/l7.43f/a7.46p/
p7.47c mutant (fig. 8). overall, the models agree well with
previous reports (hövelmann et al., 2002; wang et al., 2004):
two cysteine residues (cys113 and cys188) of the receptors are
close because they are involved in a disulfide bond; pglu1 of
the ligands formed hydrogen bonds with asn5.39 of the receptors; trp3 of the ligands was located in the aromatic cage
formed by trp6.48, phe5.43, and tyr6.52 of the receptors; arg8
of  xxxd2226xxx  formed an ionic interaction with glu7.32 of the
sep/l7.38f/l7.43f/a7.46p/p7.47c mutant.
gnrh-ii and  xxxd2226xxx  differ by three residues: his/tyr5,
trp/ xxxg234xxx , and tyr/arg8. trp7 of gnrh-ii made a hydrophobic contact with pro7.32 of gmgnrhr-2. tyr8 had an interaction with pro7.32 and his7.36 (fig. 8a). in addition, trp7
formed a hydrogen bond with the carbonyl oxygen of val7.30,
and tyr8 did so with the backbone of ser7.33. however, in the
 xxxd2226xxx /gmgnrhr-2 complex,  xxxg234xxx  formed a hydrophobic
contact with tyr6.58. arg8 moved to el2 and interacted with
val4.67 via a hydrophobic interaction (fig. 8b). on the other
hand, trp7 of gnrh-ii formed hydrophobic contacts with
glu7.32 and his7.36 of the sep/l7.38f/l7.43f/a7.46p/p7.47c

the sep/l7.38f/l7.43f/a7.46p/p7.47c mutant,  xxxg234xxx  formed hydrophobic contact with tyr6.58, and arg8 had an ionic interaction with glu7.32 (fig. 8d). mutation of the four amino

1107

acids at tmh7 altered intramolecular interactions. for instance, the hydrogen bond between  xxxg234xxx .43 and ala7.46 of
gmgnrhr-2 was suppressed in the sep/l7.38f/l7.43f/
a7.46p/p7.47c mutant. in addition, novel hydrophobic contacts of phe7.38 with leu6.54, phe7.43 with  xxxg241xxx .61, and pro7.46
with  xxxg234xxx .44 were formed in the mutant receptor. it is also
notable that the various intramolecular interactions were
highly dependent on ligand type. hydrophobic contacts of
phe7.43 with  xxxg392xxx .42 and val2.57, cys7.47 with gly1.49, and
hydrogen bonds between cys7.47 and ser1.45 and asn1.50 were
present in the mutant receptor/ xxxd2226xxx  complex, but these
interactions were absent in the mutant receptor/gnrh-ii
complex. in contrast, the hydrophobic contacts of phe7.38
with leu6.53 and pro7.46 with val2.53 were present in the
mutant receptor/gnrh-ii complex.

discussion

fig. 7. ligand selectivity of the chimeric receptors to various chimeric
gnrhs. cv-1 cells were transfected with wild-type (gm2) (a), rel3l (b),
or sep/l7.38f/l7.43f/a7.46p/p7.47c (c). cells were treated with different
concentrations of wild-type and chimeric gnrhs for 6 h.

the present study demonstrates that replacement of el3
and el3-proximal tmh7 of gmgnrhr-2 with those of rat
 xxxg931xxx  greatly improves ligand sensitivity to  xxxd2226xxx  but
not to gnrh-ii. site-directed mutations on gmgnrhr-2 and
back mutations on the domain-swapped receptor show that
the pps motif in el3 and  xxxg234xxx .38,  xxxg234xxx .43, ala7.46, and
pro7.47 in tmh7 of gmgnrhr-2 and the corresponding residues of rat  xxxg931xxx  are responsible for differential ligand
sensitivity to  xxxd2226xxx  and gnrh-ii.
it was suggested that not only glu/asp7.32 but also the
positions of ser and pro flanking glu/asp7.32 in el3 of mammalian type i  xxxg931xxx  determine high selectivity for  xxxd2226xxx 
(fromme et al., 2004; wang et al., 2004). these findings
indicate that a local conformation of el3 is critical for differential ligand selectivity among nonmammalian and mammalian types i and ii gnrhrs. however, replacement of el3
from gmgnrhr-2 alone does not affect ligand selectivity to
 xxxd2226xxx  and gnrh-ii. likewise, substitution of sep for the
pey motif of bfgnrhr-2 does not alter ligand sensitivity to
 xxxd2226xxx  and gnrh-ii (wang et al., 2004). these observations suggest that other amino acid residues/motifs are involved in the selectivity of gnrh. our study strongly suggests that in mammalian type ii  xxxg931xxx , el3-proximal
tmh7 in addition to el3 participates in differential ligand
selectivity. the importance of el3-proximal tmh7 in ligand
sensitivity is supported by the observation that rat  xxxg931xxx 
with the entire tmh7 of gmgnrhr-2 (r6tm) exhibits a
significant decrease in sensitivity for  xxxd2226xxx . mutations of
pro7.47 to cysteine combined with the mutation of  xxxg234xxx .43 to
phenylalanine and/or ala7.46 to proline significantly increases sensitivity for  xxxd2226xxx , whereas mutations of a single
amino acid residue at these positions does not affect ligand
selectivity to  xxxd2226xxx , suggesting that the combination of
each amino acid in tmh7 is critical for differential ligand
selectivity.
on the basis of millar’s classification (millar et al., 2004),
we aligned the sequences of el3 and proximal tmh7 of
various  xxxg931xxx  subtypes: human-1 and rat-1 for mammalian type i receptors, green monkey-2 and marmoset-2 for
type ii mammalian receptors, bullfrog-3 and xenopus-2 for
nonmammalian type ii receptors, japanese medaka-1 and
bullfrog-2 for type iii receptors, and finally japanese
medaka-2, bullfrog-2, and catfish-1 for nonmammalian type i
receptors.  xxxg234xxx .40,  xxxg234xxx .44, and asn7.45 residues are con-

1108

li et al.

served between gmgnrhr-2 and the mammalian type i
receptors, but these residues are also largely conserved in
many other nonmammalian gnrhrs. thus, these amino
acid residues are not specific to mammalian  xxxg931xxx  subtypes. after excluding the amino acids that are conserved
throughout the  xxxg931xxx  subtypes, we found that at least four
residues, iso7.37,  xxxg234xxx .38, gly7.42, and  xxxg234xxx .43, in gmgnrhr-2 are different from those in mammalian type i receptors but are highly conserved in nonmammalian gnrhrs
(fig. 9). among these, iso7.37 and gly7.42 are not likely to
contribute to  xxxd2226xxx  selectivity, because back-mutations of
these residues in the rel3l receptor did not significantly

affect sensitivity to  xxxd2226xxx . two amino acids, ala7.47 and
pro7.48, in gmgnrhr-2 are different from either those in
type i mammalian  xxxg931xxx  or in nonmammalian gnrhrs.
thus, they are unique to the type ii mammalian receptors.
double or triple mutations of  xxxg234xxx .43, ala7.46, and pro7.47
in tmh7 significantly increase ligand sensitivity to  xxxd2226xxx .
we cannot explain clearly how the combined mutation
l7.38f/a7.46p/p7.47c increases  xxxd2226xxx  sensitivity. it is unlikely that these residues have direct interactions with
 xxxd2226xxx  because they are deeply buried in the three-dimensional structure. rather, the mutation on these residues may
play a role in modulating conformation of the binding pocket

ligand selectivity of gnrh receptors

in el3. our molecular modeling data consistently show no
direct interactions of these residues with the ligand. it is of
interest to note that inter- and intramolecular interactions of
the mutant receptor could be modified by the ligand type
applied, indicating that conformational changes in these residues may be closely related to the alteration in the ligand
binding pocket of el3.
amino acids at positions 7.46 and 7.47 in tmh7 seem
critical for receptor conformation and stability. the mutation
of ala7.46 to proline in wild-type gmgnrhr-2 and the mutation of pro7.46 to alanine or cys7.47 to proline in rel3l impair
receptor responsiveness. extremely low binding of these mutant receptors to gnrh suggests that this impairment can be
ascribed to the loss of binding activity or receptor stability. it
is known that a proline residue leads to a local constraint on
the polypeptide chain conformation because of its pyrrolidine
ring structure. thus, proline at a proper position in tmh7
seems to be important for receptor conformation/stability in
wild-type and mutant gmgnrhr-2. the occurrence of two
successive proline residues found in the rel3l/c7.47p and
a7.46p mutants might disrupt receptor conformation/stability because the loss of responsiveness of a7.46p mutant can be
rescued by a double mutation (a7.46p/p7.47c). furthermore,
pro7.46 in the sep/l7.38f/l7.43f/a7.46p/p7.47c mutant has an
intramolecular contact with  xxxg234xxx .44, which is different from
that of the wild-type receptor in which ala7.46 at the same
position has a hydrophobic interaction with  xxxg234xxx .43. pro7.47
alone in gmgnrhr-2 could not critically alter receptor conformation/stability because the mutation of pro7.47 to cysteine did not affect ligand potency. the cysteine residue at
position 7.47 is highly conserved in nonmammalian and
mammalian type i gnrhrs, as well as in many other
gpcrs, except for gmgnrhr-2 (fig. 9). thus, it may be
possible that mutation of pro7.47 to cysteine helps to form a
more stable conformation. mutation of  xxxg234xxx .43 to phenylala-

nine in gmgnrhr-2 abolishes the receptor responsiveness to
ligand, which can be rescued by a double mutation (l7.43f/
p7.47c). in a three-dimensional structure,  xxxg234xxx .43 and pro7.47
are spatially very close. therefore, it is postulated that a
mutation of  xxxg234xxx .43 to phenylalanine might cause a steric
hindrance, which can be reversed by a further replacement of
pro7.47 to cysteine. moreover, double mutations (l7.43f/
p7.47c or a7.46p/p7.47c) not only rescue the activity of the
l7.43f or a7.46p mutant, but also significantly increase the
ligand sensitivity to both  xxxd2226xxx  and gnrh-ii. furthermore, an approximately 100-fold increase in sensitivity toward  xxxd2226xxx  was observed in the triple mutant l7.43f/
a7.46p/p7.47c compared with that of wild-type gmgnrhr-2.
such an increase in sensitivity to ligands suggests that this
motif is crucially involved in receptor activation. thus, it is
likely that pro7.47 in the wild-type gmgnrhr-2 and pro7.46
in mutant receptors are involved in tmh movements, contributing to gpcr activation/inactivation by forming molecular hinges or swivels (sansom and weinstein, 2000; stitham
et al., 2002).
it is noteworthy that replacement of el3 and el3-proximal tmh7 or mutations of amino acids in these regions did
not decrease sensitivity to gnrh-ii; instead, there was a
slightly increased sensitivity to gnrh-ii. it is well known
that an acidic amino acid at position 7.32 in el3 is required
for high-affinity binding with arg8 of  xxxd2226xxx . it seems that
such an acidic residue also plays a certain role in interaction
with tyr8 of gnrh-ii. using a molecular model, blomenröhr
et al. (2002) suggested that tyr8 of gnrh-ii interacts with
glu7.32 in el3 of the catfish  xxxg931xxx . our molecular model
also consistently showed that tyr8 of gnrh-ii has contact
with glu7.32 of the sep/l7.38f/l7.43f/a7.46p/p7.47c mutant.
it should be noted that arg8 of  xxxd2226xxx  did not interact with
the pps motif of wild-type gmgnrhr-2, whereas tyr8 of
gnrh-ii had contact with pro7.32 of wild-type gmgnrhr-2.

fig. 9. amino acid sequence alignment of el3 and tmh7 in gnrhrs and other gpcrs. the amino acids in el3 and tmh7 responsible for ligand
selectivity are shown in boldface type and are indicated by arrows. the amino acids that are highly conserved among mammalian type ii and
nonmammalian gnrhrs but differ from the mammalian type i receptor are highlighted. it is noteworthy that the cysteine residue at position 7.48
is highly conserved in other gpcrs. sequences used are human-1  xxxg931xxx  (genbank accession no.  xxxg931xxx ), rat-1  xxxg931xxx  (genbank accession

 xxxg931xxx  (genbank accession no. af257320), bullfrog-1–3  xxxg931xxx  (genbank accession nos. af144063, af153913, and af144062), japanese (j)
medaka-1–2  xxxg931xxx  (genbank accession nos. ab057677 and ab057676), catfish-1  xxxg931xxx  (genbank accession no. x97497), human  xxxg99xxx

li et al.

thus, at least in the gmgnrhr-2 structure, gnrh-ii may
not discriminate the receptor with the pps motif from the
receptor with the sep motif.
substitution of histidine for tyr5 of  xxxd2226xxx  did not alter
its potency to activate wild-type gmgnrhr-2, rel3l, or
sep/l7.38f/l7.43f/a7.46p/p7.47c, suggesting that position 5 of
gnrh does not largely contribute to receptor-ligand interaction. this result is consistent with previous reports (blomenröhr et al., 2002; wang et al., 2003). substitution of tryptophan for  xxxg234xxx  or arg8 in  xxxd2226xxx  significantly increased the
ability to activate gmgnrhr-2, indicating the importance of
positions 7 and 8 in recognition of mammalian type ii
 xxxg931xxx . the sep/l7.38f/l7.43f/a7.46p/p7.47c mutant
showed ligand sensitivity similar to that of rel3l, implying
that multiple residues are required for distinguishing
gnrh-ii from  xxxd2226xxx . it is noteworthy that gmgnrhr-2
shows a high sequence identity in el3-proximal tmh7 with
nonmammalian gnrhrs but a relatively low sequence identity with that of mammalian type i  xxxg931xxx  (fig. 9). the
evolutionary divergence of el3 and tmh7 between mammalian types i and ii  xxxg931xxx , therefore, may confer the differential selectivity toward  xxxd2226xxx  and gnrh-ii.
in summary, our studies demonstrate that el3 and el3proximal tmh7 are responsible for differential ligand selectivity between mammalian types i and ii gnrhrs. the
elucidation of specific domains responsible for ligand selectivity may facilitate the understanding of ligand and receptor
molecular coevolution, the mechanism of ligand-mediated
 xxxg931xxx  activation, and the development of novel drugs.
