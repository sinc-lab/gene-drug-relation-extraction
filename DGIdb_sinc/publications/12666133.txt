localization of plasmin activity on leukocyte surfaces plays a critical role in fibrinolysis
as well as in pathological and physiological processes in which cells must degrade the
extracellular matrix in order to migrate. the binding of plasminogen to leukocytic cell
lines induces a 30- to 80-fold increase in the rate of plasminogen activation by tissue-type
(tpa) and urokinase-type (upa) plasminogen activators. in the present study we have
examined the role of ␣-enolase in plasminogen activation on the cell surface. we produced and characterized a monoclonal antibody (mab) 11g1 against purified ␣-enolase,
which abrogated about 90% of cell-dependent plasminogen activation by either upa or
tpa on leukocytoid cell lines of different lineages: b-lymphocytic, t-lymphocytic, granulocytic, and monocytic cells. in addition, mab 11g1 also blocked enhancement of plasmin
formation by peripheral blood neutrophils and monocytes. in contrast, mab 11g1 did not
affect plasmin generation in the presence of fibrin, indicating that this antibody did not
interact with fibrinolytic components in the absence of cells. these data suggest that,
although leukocytic cells display several molecules that bind plasminogen, ␣-enolase is
responsible for the majority of the promotion of plasminogen activation on the surfaces

introduction

the generation of plasmin from the zymogen, plasminogen, is the key mechanism by which fibrinolysis and
thrombolysis are accomplished. plasmin is generated
predominantly by the proteolytic action of either tissuetype (tpa) or urokinase-type (upa) plasminogen activators. plasmin is a serine-protease with a broad substrate
spectrum. plasmin can degrade fibrin directly in vivo
[5,6] and also can activate proteolytic systems involved
in the degradation of the extracellular matrix [28,35] including matrix metalloproteinases, such as  xxxg1437xxx 
[18,32]. the binding of plasminogen to the cell surface
has profound profibrinolytic consequences: enhancement
of plasminogen activation, protection of cell-bound plasmin from its inhibitor ␣2-antiplasmin, and enhancement
of the proteolytic activity of cell-bound plasmin [24,29].
migration of cells, armed with plasmin, into fibrin clots
results in the transfer of fibrinolytic activity for thrombus
dissolution [2,17]. in addition, harnessing plasmin activ© 2003 wiley-liss, inc.

ity on cells endows the cell surface with the broadspectrum proteolytic activity necessary for processes in
which cells must degrade extracellular matrices [28].
proteolysis mediated by cell-associated plasmin can contribute to physiological processes such as tissue remod-

inhibition of cell surface mediated plasminogen activation

eling during angiogenesis, embryogenesis and development, or to pathophysiological processes such as tumor
cell invasion, metastasis and the inflammatory response
(reviewed in [10]). cell-associated plasminogen may
also contribute to bleeding associated with acute  xxxg1785xxx  [23].
plasminogen binds to many cell types with high capacity (105–107 binding sites/cell) [10]. plasminogen receptor occupancy on leukocytic cell lines induces a 30- to
80-fold increase in the rates of plasminogen activation by
tpa and upa [12,20,33]. the promotion of plasminogen
activation by cells may be due to kinetic interactions on
the cell surface, conformational effects, and/or receptor
occupancy. recently, we have described a model that
relies primarily on the concentrating effect of cells on the
reactants, with only minor modifications to cellassociated enzyme behavior [20,33]. this model can explain why low-affinity, high-capacity interactions can
regulate plasminogen activation by cells, even at physiological concentrations of plasminogen activators.
the high capacity of cells for plasminogen suggests
that no single molecule can account for total plasminogen binding to cells. both non-protein (gangliosides) and
proteins provide cellular plasminogen binding sites [10].
however, proteins with carboxyl terminal lysines are
predominantly responsible for the ability of cells to enhance plasminogen activation [25].
we previously purified a 55-kda plasminogen binding
protein from mcf7-mf (an invasive subline derived
from the human breast carcinoma cell line mcf7) cell
lysates using affinity chromatography on immobilized
plasminogen [21]. a protein was eluted with 50 mm
 xxxd3410xxx  and specifically bound plasminogen.
amino-terminal sequencing of a fragment obtained from
a tryptic digest yielded 7 amino acids, of which 6 were
identical to human ␣-enolase [21]. the cdna sequence
of ␣-enolase predicts the presence of a carboxyl-terminal
lysyl residue [13]. we also identified ␣-enolase as a candidate plasminogen receptor with a carboxyl-terminal lysine on the cell surfaces of the monocytoid line, u937
[24,31]. although no information is presently available
on the mechanism by which ␣-enolase is translocated to
the cell surface, ␣-enolase is also displayed on the surface of peripheral blood leukocytes and leukocytic cell
lines [11,24]. we have published previously that ␣-enolase binds plasminogen, promotes plasminogen activation, protects plasmin from ␣2-antiplasmin [31], and
binds both  xxxg1766xxx  [11] and lp(a) [26]. ␣-enolase is an
ubiquitous  xxxg1053xxx  [38], which also functions
as a lens structural protein in certain vertebrates [27].
thus, ␣-enolase exhibits enzymatic, structural, and receptor functions.
in the present study, in order to examine the role of
␣-enolase in the pericellular generation of plasmin activity, we produced a monoclonal antibody (mab) 11g1

235

that specifically blocked plasminogen binding to purified
␣-enolase. mab 11g1 has allowed us to study the functional consequences of ␣-enolase occupancy by plasminogen on leukocytoid cells and also on peripheral blood
neutrophils and monocytes. we found that 84–90% of
cell-dependent plasminogen activation was abrogated by
mab 11g1, suggesting that ␣-enolase has a major role in
the promotion of plasminogen activation by leukocytic
cells.
methods
proteins

human thrombin was obtained from the national institute for biological standards and control (nibsc,
hertfordshire, u.k.); lys-plasminogen was a gift of immuno (vienna, austria) and was radiolabeled using a
modified chloramine t method [12]. two-chain upa was
from laboratorios roger (barcelona, spain), and recombinant human single-chain tpa was obtained from boehringer ingelheim (ingelheim, germany). bovine serum
albumin (bsa) and fibrinogen were from sigma (st.
louis, mo). sepharose-conjugated  xxxg502xxx 
was from amersham pharmacia biotech ltd. (buckinghamshire, u.k.).
cells

the mcf7-mf cell line (an invasive subline derived
from the human breast carcinoma cell line mcf7) was
obtained from dr. rochefort (montpellier, france) [21].
the human lymphoid pre-b cell line, nalm6, was from
the american type tissue culture collection (atcc,
rockville, md). cell lines were cultured under standard
conditions, in culture media: rpmi-1640 (gibco-brl,
life technology, paisley, scotland) containing 1 mm na
pyruvate and 10% fetal bovine serum (gibco-brl).
cell lysates were prepared in lysis buffer: 0.1% triton
x-100 in phosphate-buffered saline (pbs) containing 10
mm edta, 1 mm pmsf, and 100 kiu/ml of aprotinin
(trasylol, bayer, leverkusen, germany). fresh neutrophils and monocytes were isolated from blood collected
into heparin as previously described [12] and cultured
under standard conditions.
monoclonal antibodies

monoclonal antibodies (mabs) 11g1 and 7h8 against
␣-enolase were obtained from mice immunized with a
plasminogen receptor preparation from lysates of mcf7mf cells. this fraction was prepared as a  xxxd3410xxx 
eluate from a plasminogen-sepharose column, as previously described [21]. hybridoma clones were screened
for reactivity with purified ␣-enolase by elisa. igg
fractions of the mabs were obtained from hybridoma
culture supernatants on protein a-sepharose in 0.1 m
glycine, ph 3.0. isotypes were determined using the im-

munopure monoclonal antibody isotyping kit i (pierce,
rockford, il). anti- xxxg748xxx  monoclonal antibody
(tf10-1d10) was from american diagnostica, inc.
(greenwich, ct). anti- xxxg165xxx  mab (clone z014)
was from zymed laboratories, inc. (san francisco, ca).
ligand blotting and western blotting

proteins or cell lysates were resolved by 10% sdspage, transferred to immobilon-p membranes (millipore, bedford, ma), and blocked with pbs containing
3% bsa and 0.05% tween-20 (pba). for ligand blots,
immobilon-p sheets were incubated with 2 nm 125iplasminogen in the presence of either buffer or 400 nm
unlabeled plasminogen for 1 hr at 37°c. after several
washes, bound 125i-plasminogen was detected by autoradiography using kodak xrp films. for western blots,
immobilon-p sheets were incubated with mabs at the
indicated concentrations. after incubation with an antimouse ig coupled to horseradish peroxidase (amersham), the blots were developed using the ecl detection
system (amersham). data was quantified by the epson
gt-8500 densitometer (nagano, japan) using the program phoretix (phoretix int, new castle-upon-tyne,
u.k.).
immunofluorescence studies

mcf7-mf cells were seeded onto labtek multichamber slides (nunc, naperville, il) until confluence was
reached. cells were treated with 0.1 m glycine-hcl, ph
3, for 10 min at 4°c and fixed with cold methanol for 10
min at 4°c, and then incubated with 100 nm of mabs for
45 min at 4°c. after being washed, bound antibodies
were detected with a fitc anti-mouse igg (130 nm)
(amersham pharmacia biotech ltd.), for 30 min at 4°c.
cells were examined with a nikon fluorescence microscope and photographed with 400 asa kodak tri-x
film.
subcellular fractionation

nalm6 cells (2 × 106) were lysed in lysis buffer (see
above) containing 0.32 m sucrose and centrifuged at
1,000g for 10 min. the supernatant, containing the postnuclear fraction, was centrifuged further at 35,000g for
30 min. the resultant supernatant, containing the cytosolic fraction, was reserved and the crude plasma membrane fraction containing mitochondria was separated as
a pellet. this pellet was resuspended in lysis buffer containing 0.32 m sucrose, layered on a 20% percoll solution, and centrifuged at 30,000g for 40 min. two bands
were obtained; the upper one, containing the plasma
membrane fraction, was recovered and centrifuged at
200,000g for 60 min. the resultant pellet was washed in
pbs and resuspended in lysis buffer.

kinetic analysis of plasmin generation

the effect of mabs on plasminogen activation by upa
in the presence of cells was determined as previously
described [19]. briefly, varying concentrations of cells
(from 5 × 104 to 2 × 107 cells/ml) were incubated with
500 nm lys-plasminogen, upa or tpa, at the indicated
concentrations, increasing concentrations of mabs, and
the chromogenic substrate 0.5 mm s-2251 (chromogenix). plasmin generation was monitored as the increase in
o.d. 405 nm, due to s-2251 hydrolysis. plasminogen
activation rates were calculated as described [19].
ligand-binding analysis

for purified proteins, 10 pmol of ␣-enolase were applied to immobilon-p filters, blocked with pba and then
incubated with 10 nm 125i-plasminogen in buffer or in
the presence of antibodies. after several washings with
pba, individual immobilon-p sheets were counted in a
1261 multigamma gamma counter (lkb-wallac,
turku, finland). for plasminogen binding to nalm6
cells, ligand-binding assays were performed as previously described [11]. specific binding was measured as
the difference in radioactivity bound to proteins or cells
in the presence of absence of a 200-fold molar excess of
unlabeled ligand.
fibrin clot lysis assay

human thrombin (4 iu/ml) was added to 96-well microtiter plates, previously blocked with pba. clotting
was initiated by addition of a solution of fibrinogen (14.7
␮m) and lys-plasminogen (100 nm) in 0.04 m trishcl, ph 7.4, containing 0.01% tween-20 to the plates.
clotting was monitored at 37°c at 405 nm, until a stable
o.d. was achieved. lysis was initiated by adding upa
(10–400 pm in the same buffer) to the clots. clot lysis
was monitored by the decrease in o.d. 405 nm due to the
loss of opacity during fibrin degradation. plasminogen
activation rates were calculated by linear regression from
plots of o.d. versus time squared. for inhibition experiments, 130 nm of mabs were added to the thrombin
solution.

results
specific recognition of cell surface associated
human ␣-enolase by monoclonal antibodies

we generated several monoclonal antibodies to an
␣-enolase plasminogen receptor preparation from
mcf7-mf (fig. 1a, lane 1) that specifically bound 125iplasminogen (fig. 1a, lanes 2 and 3). in the present
study, two mabs [11g1 (igg2b) and 7h8 (igg2a)] were

selected because of their strong reactivity against purified ␣-enolase in elisa. in western blotting both mabs
reacted against purified ␣-enolase (fig. 1b, lanes 1 and
2) and detected a single component of 55 kda in mcf7mf cell lysates (fig. 1b, lanes 4 and 5). mab 9c12, an
antibody raised against a plasminogen receptor of ␣-enolase type from u937 cells [3,24], recognized the same
band (fig. 1b, lanes 3 and 6), suggesting the molecular
identity of the plasminogen receptor of different origins.
an identical component was also detected with both antibodies in cell lysates of other leukocyte cell types:
nalm6 and molt4 (b- and t-lymphoid cells, respectively) and nb4 promyelocytic cells (data not shown),
suggesting the immunochemical identity of receptors of
different cellular origins. in addition, in elisa and
western blotting, both mabs did not react with other
fibrinolytic proteins as plasminogen, tpa, or upa (data
not shown).

subcellular distribution of ␣-enolase in
nalm6 cells

we have previously demonstrated that a fraction of
␣-enolase (about 6% of total ␣-enolase) is present on the
surfaces of several cell types and this fraction can be
detected by a monoclonal antibody (9c12) against an
external loop of the ␣-enolase molecule [3,24]. however,
mab 9c12 does not inhibit the interaction of plasminogen with ␣-enolase, presumably because the external
loop is distant from the reactive c-terminal lysine of
␣-enolase. therefore, we tested whether mabs 11g1 and
7h8 could also identify ␣-enolase on cell surfaces. to
determine the presence of ␣-enolase in the plasma membrane, subcellular fractionation of the human blymphoid cell line nalm6 was performed. by western
blotting, plasma membrane and cytosolic fractions each
contained a single band at 55 kda that reacted with mab

11g1 (fig. 1d, lane 1). a more intense 55-kda band was
observed in the cytosolic fraction (fig. 1d, lane 2).
therefore, about 6–8% of total cellular ␣-enolase was
present in the plasma membrane. in immunofluorescence
studies, carried out on non-permeabilized mcf7-mf
cells, cell surface associated fluorescence was observed
with both mabs, 11g1 and 7h8 (fig. 1c, panels 1 and 2,
respectively), suggesting the presence of ␣-enolase on
the cell surface. no immunofluorescence was observed
when an irrelevant mab was used as the negative control
(fig. 1c, panel 3). these data indicated that the fraction
of ␣-enolase exposed on cell surfaces could also be detected with these antibodies.
influence of mab 11g1 on plasminogen binding
to purified ␣-enolase

we tested whether mabs 11g1 and 7h8 interfere with
plasminogen binding to purified ␣-enolase. specific
binding of 125i-plasminogen to purified ␣-enolase was
inhibited by mab 11g1 in a dose-dependent manner
(fig. 2). an ic50 of 30 nm was determined and complete
inhibition was observed at 100 nm mab 11g1 under the
experimental conditions described. in parallel experiments, mab 7h8 did not inhibit 125i-plasminogen binding. in both cases, either 20 mm  xxxd146xxx  or a 200-fold
excess of unlabeled plasminogen completely inhibited
plasminogen binding to purified ␣-enolase (data not
shown).
inhibition of cell-promoted plasminogen
activation by anti-␣-enolase mab 11g1

the interaction of fibrinolytic components with surfaces of several leukocytic cell lines promotes plasmin-

 xxxd2046xxx  activation by upa and by tpa [20,33]. in addition,
nalm6 lymphoid cells, which do not express urokinase
receptors ( xxxg1768xxx ,  xxxg1768xxx ) but bind plasminogen with high
capacity, also can promote plasmin generation to the
same extent as cells bearing  xxxg1768xxx  [20]. thus, initially
we selected nalm6 cells to investigate the effect of mabs
11g1 and 7h8 on cell-dependent plasminogen activation. figure 3a shows that plasminogen activation catalyzed by upa is enhanced by increasing concentrations
of nalm6 cells. in the absence of cells, very low amounts
of plasmin were generated (<0.3 pm/sec). in the presence
of 2 × 107 cells/ml, 4.6 pm/sec of plasmin was generated. mab 11g1 inhibited plasminogen activation in a
dose-dependent manner. the addition of mab 11g1 at
440 nm or 1,300 nm reduced stimulation of plasminogen
activation by nalm6 cells by >50% and >90%, respectively. in contrast, mab 7h8 did not affect plasminogen
activation under these experimental conditions. in control experiments, mab 11g1 had no effect on s-2251
cleavage by plasmin in the absence of cells. figure 3b
shows the inhibition of plasmin formation by adding increasing concentrations of mab 11g1 (0–1,300 nm) to a
single nalm6 cell concentration (2 × 106 cells/ml). the
ic50 observed was dependent upon the cell concentration, as expected for a mab against a receptor. at this
nalm6 cell concentration, the ic50 for inhibition of plasminogen activation by mab 11g1 was 300 nm.
the addition of mab 11g1 to cells also abrogated
tpa-induced plasminogen activation. very low levels of
plasmin were generated when plasminogen was incubated with cells alone (<0.35 pm/sec), but when tpa was
added the generation of plasmin was markedly increased
(4.85 pm/sec). addition of mab 11g1 (440 nm) reduced
plasmin generation by 63% (1.8 pm/sec), whereas using
an anti- xxxg748xxx  antibody (440 nm) as control, plasmin generation was 4.98 pm/sec. these data indicated
that the effect of mab 11g1 was not dependent on the
plasminogen activator used.
with the evidence that mab 11g1 blocked the promotion of plasmin generation by cells, we tested whether
this antibody interfered with plasminogen binding to
nalm6 cells. nalm6 cells were incubated with 125iplasminogen in buffer or with mab 11g1 or mab 7h8.
specific binding was measured as the difference in radioactivity bound to cells in the presence of absence of a
200-fold molar excess of unlabeled plasminogen. in contrast to the effect with purified ␣-enolase, 440 nm of
mab 11g1 inhibited plasminogen binding to cells by
only 15–20%, whereas mab 7h8 gave no inhibition.
these results suggest that, although nalm6 cells display
several molecules capable of binding plasminogen, only
the protein recognized by mab 11g1, ␣-enolase, is responsible for the majority of plasmin generation on the
cell surface.

we wondered if other described plasminogen receptors have a role in plasminogen activation in nalm6 cells.
with this purpose in this mind, we tested a mab against
 xxxg165xxx  (clone z014), another major plasminogen receptor that has been shown to inhibit plasmin binding to
monocyte-derived macrophages [9]. by western blotting
and facs analysis, nalm6 cells have been shown to be
negative for this antibody (data not shown), suggesting
than  xxxg165xxx  does not play a role as plasminogen receptor on these cells.
effect of mab 11g1 on plasmin generation
induced by up-modulation of plasminogen
receptor expression on peripheral blood
neutrophils and monocytes

mab 11g1 inhibited plasmin generation stimulated by
a broad band of leukocytic cells. when a set of leukocytoid cell lines (including thp-1 monocytoid cells,
nb4 promyelocytic cells, and t-lymphoid molt4 cells)
was analyzed for promotion of plasmin generation by
either tpa or upa, mab 11g1 (440 nm) reduced plasmin generation to a similar extent as that on nalm6 cells
b-lymphoid cells, ranging from 55% to 87% inhibition
(data not shown).

peripheral blood neutrophils and monocytes bind plasminogen and promote plasminogen activation [12,15].
these cells can also up-regulate their plasminogen receptor expression by culture, and this modulation is paralleled by an increased ability to promote plasmin generation [12,15]. to analyze whether mab 11g1 also could
abrogate plasmin generation induced by up-regulation of
plasminogen receptors, isolated neutrophils and monocytes were cultured for 24 hr, and their capacity to promote plasminogen activation by tpa was analyzed in the
presence or absence of mab 11g1. as shown in fig. 4,
24 hr of culture of neutrophils and monocytes increased
plasminogen activation by tpa by a 9- and 7-fold factor,
respectively (fig. 4a,b). plasminogen activation was almost fully abrogated by the addition of 440 nm mab
11g1. in contrast, no effect on plasmin generation was
observed using an anti- xxxg748xxx  mab as a negative
control.

indicated in the figure.

mined whether the presence of carboxy-terminal lysines
in the mab 11g1 might be responsible. first, we determined whether mab 11g1 binds directly to immobilized
plasminogen. for this purpose, plasminogen (10 ␮g) and
␣-enolase (2 ␮g) were run in sds-page and submitted
to western-blotting using mab 11g1. as expected,
mab 11g1 bound strongly to ␣-enolase, whereas we
could not detect mab 11g1 bound to immobilized plasminogen (fig. 5a, lanes 1 and 2). second, we determined
whether the treatment of mab 11g1 with sepharoseconjugated cpb affects its ability to inhibit plasmin generation in the presence of nalm6 cells. incubation of
mab 11g1 with sepharose-conjugated cpb for 1 hr did
not affect the ability of mab 11g1 to recognize ␣-enolase by western-blotting (fig. 5a, lanes 2 and 4) or
elisa (fig. 5b). furthermore, cpb-treated mab 11g1
did not affect its inhibitory ability on plasminogen activation induced by nalm6 cells (data not shown). therefore, it is unlikely that mab 11g1 inhibits plasminogen
interaction to cells due to the presence of carboxylterminal lysine residues.
effect of mab 11g1 on fibrin-dependent
plasminogen activation

as a control to insure that the effect of mab 11g1 was
specific for ␣-enolase-dependent plasminogen activation,
we tested the ability of mab 11g1 to inhibit plasminogen activation in the presence of fibrin. thus, the effect
of mab 11g1 on plasminogen activation rates was analyzed by measuring the lysis of a fibrin clot, as previously described [19]. mab 11g1 did not inhibit fibrin
clot lysis induced by increasing concentrations of upa
(10–400 pm) (fig. 6). the activation rates obtained in
the presence of mab 11g1 paralleled those observed
using an irrelevant mab (anti- xxxg748xxx ). these results demonstrate that mab 11g1 did not affect fibrinstimulated plasminogen activation at a concentration that
fully abrogated cell-dependent plasminogen activation as
well as the interaction of plasminogen with ␣-enolase.
thus, mab 11g1 did not inhibit plasminogen activation
by an ␣-enolase-independent mechanism.

fig. 5. cpb treatment of mab 11g1 does not affect its ability to inhibit plasminogen activation. (a) 10 µg of plasminogen (lanes 1 and 3) or 2 µg of purified ␣-enolase (lanes 2
and 4) were subjected to sds-page and immunoblotted
with igg fractions of mab 11g1 (lanes 1 and 2) and mab
11g1 previously treated with sepharose-conjugated cpb
(lanes 3 and 4). (b) elisa of immobilized purified ␣-enolase

discussion

␣-enolase appears to have cellular functions and subcellular localizations that are distinct from its glycolytic
function. for example, ␣-enolase binds to f-actin and
tubulin [37] and has been localized to the centrosome in
hela cells [16,30] and to cell-surface membranes in
brain tumor cells [36]. ␣-enolase is a lens crystallin in
several vertebrates [22], undergoes axonal transport in
guinea pigs [4], and binds in vitro to single-stranded
dna in saccharomyces cerevisiae [1]. recently, a 35kda protein (mbp-1) that acts as a transcriptional regu-

inhibition of cell surface mediated plasminogen activation

fig. 6. effect of mab 11g1 on fibrin-induced plasminogen
activation. a fibrin clot formed in a mixture solution containing human thrombin (4 iu/ml), fibrinogen (14.7 mm), and
lys-plasminogen (100 nm) in 0.04 m tris-hcl, ph 7.4, 0.01%
tween-20, with and without 440 nm mab 11g1. when clot
formation took place, lysis was initiated by addition of upa
(10–400 pm). clot lysis was monitored by the decrease in
o.d. 405 nm due to the loss of opacity during fibrin degradation as described in the text. in control experiments, a
mab anti- xxxg748xxx  was used.

lator of c-myc in hela cells has been identified as a
c-terminal fragment of ␣-enolase, and it is an alternative
translation product of the ␣-enolase gene [34]. it has also
been suggested that up-regulation of ␣-enolase contributes to hypoxia tolerance through nonglycolytic mechanisms [34]. a fraction of ␣-enolase is also expressed on
the plasma membrane [24,31,36]. in the present study we
have demonstrated that two monoclonal antibodies
against ␣-enolase recognized this molecule on the cell
surface and that this cell-surface associated ␣-enolase
acts as a plasminogen receptor on leukocytic cells
[21,31].
considering the extraordinarily high number of plasminogen-binding sites/cell (approximately 107), no
single surface protein can account for all plasminogen
binding sites. while plasminogen may bind to all cellsurface proteins with c-terminal lysine residues, the
functional consequences may be distinct. in this study,
we have demonstrated that a mab to a purified plasminogen receptor, ␣-enolase, blocked the promotion of plasminogen activation by nalm6 cells (90%), in a dosedependent manner. interestingly, the extent of inhibition
of plasminogen binding to cells by this antibody was
markedly less (15–20%) than its inhibition of plasminogen activation. therefore, although several cell surface
molecules may serve as plasminogen binding sites on
these cells, ␣-enolase appears to be responsible for the
majority of cell-dependent plasminogen activation. that
could explain the different abilities of the mab 11g1 to
completely inhibit plasminogen activation on the cell
surface but only partially plasminogen binding to the
cells. we have previously reported that ␣-enolase contributed only 10% of plasminogen binding to u937 cells

241

[31]. taken together, these data suggest that plasminogen
binding function is necessary but not sufficient to promote plasminogen activation on the surfaces of cells and
suggests than only a fraction of all cellular plasminogen
binding sites participates in the cell-dependent enhancement of plasmin generation.
mab 11g1 inhibited cell-stimulated plasmin generation by b-lymphoid nalm6 cells as other leukocytoid cell
lines of different lineages: t-lymphoid (molt4), granulocytic (nb4), and monocytoid (thp-1) cells. in addition, mab 11g1 also abrogated plasminogen activation
on neutrophils and monocytes. as we have previously
described [15], culture of peripheral blood neutrophils
and monocytes induces a higher plasminogen binding
capacity, which is paralleled with by a greater capacity to
promote plasminogen activation. using this model we
demonstrated that mab 11g1 also abrogated plasminogen activation by these cultured leukocytes. the effect
was cell-specific as demonstrated by the lack of inhibition of plasmin generation in the presence of fibrin, demonstrating that this antibody does not interfere with the
activity of fibrinolytic components in absence of cells.
the mechanism for ␣-enolase release and membrane
attachment remains unknown. it is of interest to note that
a number of intracellular proteins that have been proposed as candidates for plasminogen receptors, such as
 xxxg165xxx  [7,14] or actin [8], lack cleavage signal sequences or transmembrane domains and yet are present
on cell surfaces. however, the mechanism of transport
and attachment of these molecules to the cell surface
remains unknown also.
we have previously reported ␣-enolase as a candidate
for plasminogen receptor in cells from different origin
[21,31]. in this study we present a mab against ␣-enolase that specifically inhibits plasmin generation on the
presence of a variety of cells, suggesting that ␣-enolase
has a major role in the promotion of plasminogen activation by leukocytic cells. mab 11g1 can now be used
to explore the mechanism by which plasminogen binding
and also plasmin formation mediate physiological and
pathological processes.
