abstract

activating mutations in ras and b‐raf were identified in several
human cancers. in addition, several receptor tyrosine kinases, acting upstream of ras, were found either mutated or overexpressed in human
tumors. because oncogenic activation of the ras/raf pathway may lead
to a sustained proliferative signal resulting in tumor growth and progression, inhibition of this pathway represents an attractive approach for cancer
drug discovery. a novel class of biaryl urea that inhibits c‐ xxxg1924xxx  was
discovered using a combination of medicinal and combinatorial chemistry
approaches. this effort culminated in the identification of the clinical
candidate bay 43‐9006 (sorafenib, nexavarw), which has recently been
approved by the fda for advanced renal cell carcinoma in phase iii
clinical trials. sorafenib inhibited the kinase activity of both c‐raf and
b‐raf (wild type and v600e mutant). it inhibited mek and erk

phosphorylation in various cancer cell lines and tumor xenografts
and exhibited potent oral antitumor activity in a broad spectrum of human
tumor xenograft models. further characterization of sorafenib revealed that
this molecule was a multikinase inhibitor that targeted the  xxxg2413xxx  receptor family ( xxxg802xxx   xxxg1274xxx ‐2 and  xxxg802xxx   xxxg1274xxx ‐3) and platelet‐derived growth factor receptor family ( xxxg1709xxx   xxxg1710xxx ‐ and kit), which play
key roles in tumor progression and angiogenesis. thus, sorafenib may inhibit
tumor growth by a dual mechanism, acting either directly on the tumor
(through inhibition of raf and kit signaling) and/or on tumor angiogenesis
(through inhibition of  xxxg802xxx   xxxg1274xxx  and  xxxg1709xxx   xxxg1710xxx  signaling). in phase i and phase
ii clinical trials, sorafenib showed limited side effects and, more importantly, disease stabilization. this agent is currently being evaluated in phase iii
clinical trials in renal cell and hepatocellular carcinomas.
introduction

several growth factors, cytokines, and proto‐oncogenes transduce their
signals through the ras/raf/mek/erk signaling pathway (marais and
marshall, 1996; repasky et al., 2004). this pathway is an important mediator of tumor cell proliferation, survival, and differentiation and is also
central to tumor angiogenesis. alteration of the ras/raf pathway was
shown to contribute to the pathogenesis and progression of human cancers,
making the components of this signaling cascade attractive as therapeutic
targets. overexpression or mutation of cell‐surface  xxxg2198xxx  receptors and mutation of downstream effectors, such as ras and b‐raf, results
in constitutive activation of the raf pathway. ras‐activating mutations
were found in approximately 50% of colon carcinomas, 30% of lung
carcinomas, 80% of pancreatic carcinomas, and 20% of various hematopoietic malignancies (minamoto et al., 2000). moreover, the ras pathway is
often constitutively activated by many receptor tyrosine kinases, such as
those for the epidermal, platelet‐derived, or vascular‐endothelial growth
factors. thus, most human tumors, not just those with ras mutations,
exploit the ras signal transduction pathway as a means to achieve continuous cellular proliferation and survival. moreover, a downstream effector of
ras, b‐raf, was shown to be mutated in 30% of low‐grade ovarian
cancers (singer et al., 2003), 35–70% of papillary thyroid cancers (cohen
et al., 2003; kimura et al., 2003; nikiforova et al., 2003), 10–15% of colorectal cancers (davies et al., 2002; rajagopalan et al., 2002; yuen et al., 2002),
and 70% of malignant melanomas (brose et al., 2002; davies et al., 2002;
pollock et al., 2003; yazdi et al., 2003). approximately 90% of these
mutations occur in the activation region of the kinase domain as a single‐
base substitution that converts a valine to  xxxd2431xxx  at codon 600

(v600eb‐raf) (davies et al., 2002). this mutation causes activation of
b‐ xxxg1924xxx  and, thus, constitutive stimulation of mek/erk pathway
independent of any upstream activating signal.
a number of studies have suggested that inhibitors of the raf pathway
could have significant clinical benefit in the treatment of human cancers
(kolch, 2002). for instance, dominant‐negative mutants of raf, mek, or
erk significantly reduced the transforming ability of mutant ras in rodent
fibroblasts (arboleda et al., 2001). moreover, human tumor cell lines
expressing a dominant negative mek were deficient in their ability to grow
under both anchorage‐dependent and anchorage‐independent conditions
(arboleda et al., 2001). these mutants inhibited both the primary and
metastatic growth of human tumor xenografts (arboleda et al., 2001).
additional evidence supporting the relevance of therapeutically targeting
raf comes from work with isis 5132, a raf antisense oligonucleotide
(monia et al., 1996). isis 5132, a c‐raf phosphorothioate antisense
oligonucleotide (tcccgcctgtgacatgcatt) designed to target
the 3‐prime utr of the c‐raf message, was found to inhibit the growth
of human lung, breast, bladder, and colon tumor xenografts. finally, reduction of v600eb‐raf activity by sirna in melanoma xenograft tumors
prevented vascular development because of decreased vegf secretion
and, subsequently, increasing apoptosis in tumors (sharma et al., 2005).
small molecules that inhibit raf or mek kinases have been identified
and are being evaluated in the clinic (sebolt‐leopold and herrera, 2004;
strumberg and seeber, 2005). investigators at pfizer discovered ci‐1040, a
small molecule, non‐atp competitive, allosteric mek inhibitor. ci‐1040
was shown to inhibit erk phosphorylation in a panel of cancer cell lines
and tumor growth in xenograft models (allen et al., 2003). optimization
efforts led to the discovery of a second‐generation compound, pd‐0325901,
which recently entered phase i clinical trials. sorafenib, which is a proprietary compound of bayer pharmaceuticals corporation and is being jointly
developed by bayer and onyx pharmaceuticals, is an orally active multikinase inhibitor that inhibits the serine/threonine kinases, c‐raf and
b‐raf (wild type and v600e mutant), and tyrosine kinases of the vascular‐endothelial growth factor receptor ( xxxg802xxx   xxxg1274xxx ‐2 and  xxxg802xxx   xxxg1274xxx ‐3) and
platelet‐derived growth factor receptor  ( xxxg1709xxx   xxxg1710xxx ‐ and c‐kit) families
(wilhelm et al., 2004). sorafenib may inhibit tumor growth by combining
two anticancer activities: inhibition of tumor cell proliferation and survival
(through c‐raf and b‐raf) and tumor angiogenesis (through  xxxg802xxx   xxxg1274xxx 
and  xxxg1709xxx   xxxg1710xxx ). sorafenib was discovered after an extensive structure–
activity relationship optimization effort that started with a weak micromolar hit from high‐throughput screen (hts) (lowinger et al., 2002; lyons
et al., 2001). hts hits were confirmed in a biochemical assay and active

compounds (ic50 < 100 nm) were tested in both a mechanistic cellular
assay, which measured the level of the phosphorylated form of mek, and
a functional assay, which measured tumor cell proliferation. sorafenib is
currently being evaluated in clinical trials, including phase iii trials in renal
cell (rcc) and hepatocellular (hcc) carcinomas.
materials and methods

preparation of sorafenib
the chemical name of sorafenib is (n‐(3‐trifluoromethyl‐4‐chlorophenyl)‐n‐(4‐(2‐methylcarbamoyl pyridin‐4‐yl)oxyphenyl)urea), and the structural formula is shown in table i. sorafenib is dissolved in dmso for
in vitro experiments.
cell lines, reagents, and western blot analysis
the mda‐mb‐231 human mammary adenocarcinoma cell line was
obtained from the national cancer institute. all the other cell lines were
purchased from the american type culture collection (atcc). cell lines
were maintained in dmem (gibco), supplemented with 1% l‐glutamine
(gibco), 1% hepes buffer (gibco), and 10% heat‐inactivated fetal
bovine serum (fbs). cells were plated at 200,000 cells per well in 12‐well
tissue culture plates in growth media and incubated overnight. media was
removed and replaced with dmem supplemented with 0.1% bsa (sigma)
containing either various concentrations of sorafenib,  xxxd3462xxx  (cell signaling technology), or vehicle (dmso) for 2 h. cells were washed with cold
pbs containing 0.1 mm vanadate and lysed in a 1% triton x‐100 solution
containing protease inhibitors. lysates were clarified by centrifugation,
subjected to sds‐page, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and
blocked for 1 h in tbs containing 5% non‐fat dry milk and 1% bsa.
membranes were probed for 1 h with antibodies to pmek1/2 (ser217/
ser221),  xxxg1361xxx /2, perk1/2 (thr202/tyr204),  xxxg1369xxx /2, ppkb (ser473), and
pkb. the antibodies were purchased from cell signaling technology and
were used at a dilution of 1:000. blots were developed with horseradish
peroxidase (hrp)–conjugated secondary antibodies and amersham ecl
reagent on amersham hyperfilm.
phospho‐erk bio‐plex immunoassay
a 96‐well immunoassay (bioplex), using the laser flow cytometry
platform of bio‐rad, was used to measure the level of perk1/2 (thr202/
tyr204) in cells. exponentially growing mda‐mb231 breast carcinoma and

lox human melanoma cells were seeded at 50,000 cells per well. the next
day, the media was changed to serum‐free media containing 0.1% bsa and
various concentrations of compounds (serial dilution from 3 m–12 nm).
cells were incubated with the compounds for 2 h. the rest of the assay
was performed per manufacturer recommendation for the perk1/2 bio‐
plex assay (cat#171–304004, bio‐rad, hercules, ca). cells were washed
with 100 l of wash buffer a before addition of 80 l of cell lysis buffer.
the plate was agitated on a plate shaker at 300 rpm for 30 min at 4 .
cellular debris was pelleted by centrifugation at 4500g for 15 min at 4 ;
45 l of supernatant was diluted with an equal volume of bio‐plex phosphoprotein assay buffer b. the diluted lysate was incubated with 2000 of
5  bio‐plex beads conjugated with an anti‐ xxxg1369xxx /2 antibody. the beads
and lysate mixture was incubated at room temperature (rt) for 15–18 h.
the plate was vacuum‐filtered, washed three times, and 25 l of biotinylated perk1/2 antibody solution was added to each well. the plate was
incubated for 30 min at rt. the plate was vacuum‐filtered, washed three
times, and 50 l of streptavidin‐pe solution was added. after 10 min
incubation at rt, 125 l of resuspension buffer was added, and the relative
fluorescence units of perk1/2 were detected by counting 25 beads
with bio‐plex flow cell (probe) at high sensitivity (luminex 100 instrument,
bio‐rad).
immunohistochemistry
immunohistochemical staining of perk was performed with a rabbit
polyclonal antibody anti‐phospho  xxxd1355xxx /42mapk (thr202/tyr204) from
cell signaling technology that detects the phosphorylated  xxxd1355xxx  and
p42 map kinases (perk1 and perk2). the antibodies were diluted 1:100
with dako antibody diluent for use. slides were deparaffinized and
placed in heated citrate buffer for 35 min. they remained in the heated
buffer, acclimated to rt for approximately 30 min, and washed in distilled
water. slides were blocked in a 1.5 %  xxxd2298xxx  solution for
10 min and washed in distilled water. they were washed in pbs and
incubated with primary antibody for approximately 30 min. they were
rinsed in pbs and incubated for 30 min with a rabbit hrp labeled polymer
(dako envision þ kit). slides were rinsed in pbs and the dab substrate
chromogen was applied for 5 min. they were washed in water and counterstained with filtered hematoxylin for approximately 20 sec and then

experimental results and discussion

sorafenib inhibits mek and erk phosphorylation in cancer cells,
independent of k‐ras and b‐raf mutational status
extracellular stimuli and activating mutations activate ras, which tether raf to the plasma membrane, resulting in the stimulation of raf
kinase activity. activated raf phosphorylates mek at two key serine
residues (ser218, ser222), leading to a strong activation of mek kinase.
activated  xxxg1361xxx /2 recognize and phosphorylate  xxxg1369xxx /2 on key threonine
and tyrosine residues. phosphorylation at both the threonine (thr183) and
tyrosine (tyr185) sites on erk is necessary to induce complete enzyme
activation (kolch et al., 2005).
the effect of sorafenib on mek and erk activity was determined by
incubating cells with various concentrations of sorafenib for 2 h. cell
lysates were analyzed by immunoblotting with antibodies specific for phosphorylated mek (pmek), phosphorylated erk (perk), and, as control,
phosphorylated pkb (ppkb) (fig. 1). to control for equal protein loading,

 xxxd3462xxx  (mek inhibitor) or dmso (vehicle) for 2 h. cell lysates were subjected to western
blot analysis for phosphorylated (p) and total mek (top panel), erk (middle panel), and
pkb (bottom panel).

the same membranes were reprobed with antibodies to total mek, erk,
and pkb.  xxxd3462xxx , an inhibitor of mek kinase, was used as positive control
(lane 1). a weak raf inhibitor compound (ic50 > 10 m) of the same
chemical class as sorafenib was used as negative control (lanes 8–11).
sorafenib inhibited mek and erk phosphorylation in a dose‐dependent
manner (lanes 2–7), whereas raf‐inactive control had no effect (lanes 8–
10). sorafenib‐mediated inhibition of phosphorylation was specific to mek
and erk, because it had no effect on pkb. several human tumor cell lines
exhibit high levels of basal pmek and perk, either because of k‐ras or
b‐raf mutation or constitutive activation of growth factor receptors.
sorafenib was effective in inhibiting erk phosphorylation in most cell
lines tested, including those with k‐ras and b‐raf mutations (fig. 2).
however, the potency at which sorafenib inhibited erk phosphorylation
varied among cell lines, with ec50 ranging from 90–1200 nm (fig. 2 and
table i). this result was particularly encouraging, because it holds promise
for the potential use of sorafenib in patients with cancer who have b‐raf
and k‐ras mutations.
the concentration of sorafenib necessary to reduce erk phosphorylation by 50% (perk ec50) was determined using the phospho‐erk bioplex
immunoassay (fig. 3). the perk ec50 was determined in both the mda‐
mb‐231 cell line, which expresses b‐raf (g463v) and k‐ras (g13d)
mutants, and the lox cell line, which expresses the most predominant

b‐raf mutant (v600e). sorafenib inhibited erk phosphorylation in both
cell lines but, was 10‐fold more potent in the mda‐mb‐231 cells (ec50 ¼
90 nm) compared with lox cells (ec50 ¼ 880 nm). the ability of sorafenib
to inhibit v600eb‐raf mutant was analyzed in additional cancer lines that
express this mutant, including melanoma (skmel‐28, a2058) and colon
(colo‐205, ht‐29). the results showed a significant inhibition of erk
phosphorylation in v600eb‐raf mutant lines, demonstrating the ability of
this agent to inhibit constitutively activated b‐raf (fig. 2 and data not
shown). similar results with sorafenib were recently reported by sharma
et al. (2005), who showed inhibition of mapk‐signaling cascade and tumor
development using v600eb‐raf–expressing melanoma lines. furthermore,

606

decrease of v600eb‐raf activity, by either sirna or treatment with sorafenib, prevented vascular development because of decreased vegf secretion and, subsequently, increased apoptosis in melanoma tumors (sharma
et al., 2005). recently, karasarides et al. (2004) reported results with sorafenib that showed the inhibition of erk activity in v600eb‐raf–expressing
melanoma cell lines, a375, colo829, and wm‐266–4, which resulted in
inhibition of dna synthesis and induction of cell death in all three lines.
the in vitro and cellular profile of sorafenib is summarized in table i.
sorafenib inhibited the activity of c‐raf, b‐raf (wild type and v600eb‐
raf), as well as tyrosine kinases of the  xxxg802xxx   xxxg1274xxx  and  xxxg1709xxx   xxxg1710xxx  families,
which are key regulators of angiogenesis (table i). thus, sorafenib may
mediate its antitumor effect by acting on the tumor directly (through inhibition of raf signaling) and/or tumor angiogenesis (through inhibition of
vegf and pdgf signaling). in vitro, sorafenib had no effect on mek,
erk, or a limited panel of serine/threonine and tyrosine kinases including
the  xxxg682xxx ,  xxxg1145xxx , and cdk families (table i). sorafenib inhibited proliferation of mda‐mb‐231 tumors cells (ec50 ¼ 2800 nm), as well as pdgf‐
stimulated proliferation of human aortic smooth muscle cells (ec50 ¼
280 nm) and vegf‐stimulated proliferation of human endothelial cells
(huvec) (ec50 ¼ 12 nm) (table i and wilhelm et al. [2004]). to our
knowledge, sorafenib possesses a unique profile compared with compounds
either on the market or in clinical development, targeting both raf/mek/
erk and vegf/pdgf signaling pathways.
the antitumor efficacy of sorafenib, administered as a single agent
against established human tumor xenografts in athymic mice, was evaluated in several tumor models (wilhelm and chien, 2002; wilhelm et al.,
2004). in each model, sorafenib produced dose‐dependent tumor growth
inhibition, and during treatment with a 30‐ to 60‐mg/kg dose, complete
tumor stasis in the human ovarian (sk‐ov‐3), the human colon tumor
models (ht‐29, colo‐205, and dld‐1), and the nsclc model (a549)
was observed (wilhelm et al., 2004). no correlation was found between
sensitivity to sorafenib and k‐ras or b‐raf mutational status. indeed,
sorafenib inhibited progression of tumors with wild‐type k‐ras and
b‐raf, such as sk‐ov‐3, as well as tumors with k‐ras or b‐raf mutation, such as dld‐1, h460, a549, mda‐mb‐231, colo‐205, and ht‐29
(wilhelm et al., 2004). these results show that cells with a constitutively
active raf/mek/erk pathway are not necessarily more sensitive or
resistant to sorafenib. antitumor activity in v600eb‐raf–expressing
melanoma xenograft models has been reported by other investigators
(karasarides et al., 2004; sharma et al., 2005). sorafenib‐mediated inhibition of v600eb‐raf activity decreased vegf secretion and led to inhibition of vascular development and increased apoptosis (sharma et al., 2005).

in another study, sorafenib‐mediated inhibition of dna synthesis
and induction of cell death correlated with a substantial growth delay in
melanoma tumor xenografts (karasarides et al., 2004).
inhibition of erk phosphorylation by sorafenib in mda‐mb‐231 tumors
the phosphorylation status of mek and erk has provided a useful
pharmacodynamic marker for assessing raf inhibition (sebolt‐leopold
et al., 2003). mechanism‐of‐action studies have been carried out in the
mda‐mb‐231 xenograft model after 5 days of daily treatment with sorafenib at 30 mg/kg. the tumors were excised 3 h after the last dose and
immunostained for active erk using an antibody that only binds to phosphorylated, active  xxxg1369xxx  and  xxxg1366xxx , as described in ‘‘materials and
methods.’’ a substantial reduction in erk activity was found in tumors
from the sorafenib‐treated mice compared with the vehicle‐treated and
untreated controls (fig. 4). very low perk staining was localized at the
rim of the tumor, but no staining was observed in the central region, which
was mainly necrotic (fig. 4).
in the clinic, the phosphorylation status of erk in tumors from patients
has been evaluated in some cases. a sample of a tumor biopsy from
a patient with melanoma before and after treatment with sorafenib is
shown in fig. 5. the tumor biopsy showed moderate to strong perk
staining (76–100% of nuclei stained) before sorafenib treatment (fig. 5a
and b). this patient was treated with sorafenib daily for 1 week, after
which the treatment was discontinued for 1 week and again resumed for a
second week (7 days on/7days off dosing schedule). after a total of 14 days
therapy with sorafenib, only weak to moderate perk staining was

embedded tumor sections with a rabbit polyclonal antibody (anti‐phospho  xxxd1355xxx /42 mapk
[thr202/tyr204]) that detects phosphorylated  xxxd1355xxx  and p42 map kinases (perk1 and perk2).
the level of perk was significantly reduced in tumors obtained from sorafenib‐treated mice
compared with tumors in control groups (untreated and vehicle).

biopsy showed a strong‐to‐moderate perk staining intensity (76–100% of nuclei staining) (a
and b). after a total of 14 days therapy with sorafenib (two cycles of 7 days each), only weak‐
to‐moderate perk staining was observed (25–50% of nuclei stained) (c and d).

observed (25–50% of nuclei stained). this result showed the ability of
sorafenib to distribute well and inhibit the raf/mek/erk pathway in
human tumor tissue.
clinical testing of sorafenib in patients with cancer began in july 2000.
sorafenib exhibited safety and pharmacokinetic profiles that permitted
continuous daily administration (ahmad and eisen, 2004; hotte and hirte,

2002; mross et al., 2003; richly et al., 2003, 2004; strumberg et al., 2002,
2005). sorafenib was well tolerated, and side effects were manageable.
phase ii results in patients with rcc were very encouraging. a total of
73 patients (36%) achieved tumor shrinkage (25% compared with baseline), 69 patients (34%) had tumor measurements that remained within
25% of baseline levels, and 51 patients (25%) showed either tumor growth
(25% compared with baseline) or other radiological evidence of progression. in some cases, disease stabilization was maintained for periods in
excess of a year (ahmad and eisen, 2004). a phase iii randomized controlled trial of single‐agent sorafenib versus placebo is ongoing and is
planned to accrue more than 800 patients with rcc who have progressed
after a systemic therapy. moreover, on the basis of encouraging results of
phase ii trials, a phase iii study in patients with advanced hcc was
initiated. in addition to its use as a single agent, there are ongoing phase
ii trials to evaluate combining sorafenib with other drugs to maximize
therapeutic potential.
conclusion

sorafenib is a clinical candidate with a dual mechanism of action (i.e.,
tumor cell proliferation and tumor angiogenesis). it is a novel orally active
multikinase inhibitor that is highly potent against c‐raf and b‐raf, as
well as tyrosine kinases of the vegf and pdgf receptor families. sorafenib has a unique kinase profile compared with several kinase inhibitors
either on the market or in clinical development. with the central role of
raf and vegf signaling pathways in promoting cancer growth and
tumor angiogenesis, inhibitors of these pathways have the potential of a
broad spectrum of antitumor activity. in the clinic, sorafenib has been well
tolerated with safety and pharmacokinetic profiles that permit continuous
daily dosing. it is currently being evaluated as both a single agent and in
combination in phase ii and phase iii clinical trials.

interaction and characterization of mcp
inhibitors of ras–raf interaction
by vladimir khazak, juran kato‐stankiewicz,
fuyu tamanoi , and erica a. golemis
abstract

because of the central role of ras in cancer cell signaling, there has
been considerable interest in developing small molecule inhibitors of the
ras signaling pathways as potential chemotherapeutic agents. this chapter
describes the use of a two‐hybrid approach to identify the mcp compounds, small molecules that disrupt the interaction between ras and its
effector raf. we first outline the reagent development and selection/
counter selection methods required to successfully apply a two‐hybrid
approach to isolation of mcp compounds. separately, we describe the
collateral benefits of this screening approach in yielding novel antifungal
compounds. we then discuss secondary physiological validation approaches to confirm the mcp compounds specifically target ras–raf signaling. finally, we develop a decision tree for subsequent preclinical
characterization and optimization of this class of pathway‐targeted reagent.

introduction

cell signaling processes depend on the regulated, transient interactions
of proteins and protein complexes in response to an initiating stimulus. as a
consequence of these interactions, ‘‘information’’ is exchanged, with proteins proximal to an activating signal often causing physical modification
(e.g., phosphorylation) of other proteins distal to the signal, so as to alter
