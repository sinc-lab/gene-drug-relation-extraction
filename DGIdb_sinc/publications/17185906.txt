4he limitations of our study are those inherent to
patient based case reports 4he tenuous medical
condition of our patient limited the extent of our in
vivo testing !lso the increased expression of !#4(
receptors on our patients adrenal glands does not
prove that they are responsible for the develop
ment of his #3 4o prove a causative relationship
we would need to demonstrate functional coupling
between the !#4( receptors and cortisol produc
tion ie in vitro cortisol secretion studies and to show
that the hypercortisolism is reverted by the admin
istration of a specific receptor antagonist (owever
no specific antagonist of !#4( is available /ur
observations may not be generalizable to all cases
of !)-!( as this condition is heterogeneous !d
