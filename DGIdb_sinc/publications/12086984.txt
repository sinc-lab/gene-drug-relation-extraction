1 we have investigated the eects of the sulphonylurea,  xxxd2203xxx , currently used to treat type 2
diabetes, on atp-sensitive k+ (katp) currents of rat cardiac myocytes and on their cloned
constituents  xxxg1250xxx  and sur2a expressed in hek 293 cells.
2  xxxd2203xxx  blocked pinacidil-activated whole-cell katp currents of cardiac myocytes with an
ic50 of 6.8 nm, comparable to the potency of  xxxd2215xxx  in these cells.  xxxd2203xxx  blocked katp
channels formed by co-expression of  xxxg1250xxx /sur2a subunits in hek 293 cells in outside-out
excised patches with a similar ic50 of 6.2 nm.
3  xxxd2203xxx  was much less eective at blocking katp currents activated by either metabolic
inhibition (mi) with cn7 and iodoacetate or by the  xxxg1253xxx  opener  xxxd1868xxx  in the presence
of inhibitors of f0/f1-atpase (oligomycin) and creatine kinase (dnfb). thus 10 mm  xxxd2203xxx 
blocked pinacidil-activated currents by 499%, mi-activated currents by 70% and diazoxideactivated currents by 82%.
4 in inside-out patches from hek 293 cells expressing the cloned  xxxg1253xxx  subunits  xxxg1250xxx /
sur2a, increasing the concentration of adp (1 ± 100 mm), in the presence of 100 nm  xxxd2203xxx ,
lead to signi®cant increases in  xxxg1250xxx /sur2a channel activity. however, over the range tested, adp
did not aect cloned  xxxg1253xxx  activity in the presence of 100 nm  xxxd2215xxx . these results
are consistent with the suggestion that adp reduces  xxxd2203xxx  block of katp channels.
5 our results show that  xxxd2203xxx  is a potent blocker of native cardiac katp channels activated
by pinacidil and blocks cloned  xxxg1250xxx /sur2a channels activated by atp depletion with similar
potency. however,  xxxd2203xxx  is much less eective when katp channels are activated by mi and
this may re¯ect a reduction in  xxxd2203xxx  block by increased intracellular adp.

introduction
 xxxd2203xxx  is a relatively new sulphonylurea used in the
treatment of type 2 diabetes (klepzig et al., 1999;
sonnenberg et al., 1997; langtry & balfour, 1998; riddle
& schneider, 1998; schade et al., 1998).  xxxd2203xxx  has
become an attractive alternative to the more common antidiabetic drug  xxxd2215xxx . not only is  xxxd2203xxx  thought
to be equipotent in lowering blood glucose, but it is also
thought to have fewer and less potent extra-pancreatic
eects than  xxxd2215xxx .
sulphonylureas stimulate insulin secretion from pancreatic
b-cells by blocking atp-sensitive k+-channels (katp
channels), however, sulphonylureas may also block katp
channels of other tissues. of particular concern is the eect of
these agents on cardiac function via their action on cardiac
katp channels. katp channels are thought to play a key role
in the cardioprotection seen with  xxxg1253xxx  openers and
ischaemic pre-conditioning (ipc), a powerful protective
mechanism endogenous to cardiac muscle (terzic et al.,
1995; yellon et al., 1998). a number of reports have

suggested that mitochondrial rather than sarcolemmal katp
channels are the mediators of this protection, particularly
since protection was still observed in the absence of action
potential shortening. it should be noted however, that the
molecular identity of the mitochondrial channel remains
unknown (garlid et al., 1997; liu et al., 1998). more recently
it has been suggested that cardioprotection involves both
mitochondrial and sarcolemmal katp channels and that
activation of either channel is independently modulated by
dierent trigger substances (sanada et al., 2001). once
activated, mitochondrial and sarcolemmal katp channels
may initiate dierent protective pathways, both of which may
be integral to either limiting damage or recovering function
(tanno et al., 2001; toyoda et al., 2000).
cardioprotection, derived from either  xxxg1253xxx  openers or ipc, can be abolished by  xxxd2215xxx  which blocks
both sarcolemmal and mitochondrial katp channels. in
contrast to  xxxd2215xxx , however,  xxxd2203xxx  does not
appear to abolish ipc (klepzig et al., 1999; mocanu et al.,
2001). it has been postulated therefore, that  xxxd2203xxx  has
selective eects between dierent katp channels (ladriene et
al., 1997; olbrich et al., 1999).

c.l. lawrence et al

here, we have investigated the eects of  xxxd2203xxx  on
native sarcolemmal katp channels of adult rat cardiac
myocytes, and recombinant cardiac sarcolemmal katp
channels ( xxxg1250xxx /sur2a) stably expressed in human
embryonic kidney (hek) cells 293. we report that
 xxxd2203xxx  is an eective inhibitor of native and cloned
cardiac sarcolemmal katp channels under normal conditions with a concentration that produces half-maximal
inhibition (ic50) similar to that which we have measured
previously for  xxxd2215xxx  (lawrence et al., 2001).
however, its blocking eectiveness is reduced when katp
channels are activated by metabolic inhibition. parallel
experiments on cloned katp channels suggest that this is
due to an interaction with adp. we suggest that block of
the cardiac sarcolemmal  xxxg1253xxx  by  xxxd2203xxx 
diminishes in a metabolically compromised environment
such as that which occurs during myocardial ischaemia,
but under physiological conditions where adp concentration is not raised  xxxd2203xxx  is equipotent to  xxxd2215xxx .

methods
isolation of cardiac myocytes
adult male wistar rats (300 ± 400 g) were killed by cervical
dislocation. the care and sacri®ce of animals conformed to
the requirements of the u.k. animals (scienti®c procedures)
act 1986. the heart was rapidly removed and perfused using
the langendor technique with collagenase (type i, sigma)
and protease (type xv, sigma) solution as described
previously (lawrence & rodrigo, 1999). myocytes were then
mechanically dispersed and washed twice in normal tyrode.
typically, there was a 70 ± 90% yield of quiescent, rod-shaped
cells. cells were stored at 108c in tyrode for a maximum of
24 h.

hek 293 cells stably expressing  xxxg1250xxx /sur2a subunits
cloned  xxxg1250xxx /sur2a channel subunits stably expressed in
human embryonic kidney hek 293 cells were kindly
provided by dr andrew tinker (centre for clinical
pharmacology, department of medicine, university college
london). cells were cultured in mem with earl's salts also
containing 10% fcs and 10 mm l-glutamine. zeocin
(364 mg ml71) and  xxxg418xxx  (727 mg ml71) were included in the
media for selection purposes. cells were used between
passages 18 ± 26.

solutions
isolated ventricular myocytes were superfused with normal
tyrode containing (in mm): nacl 135, kcl 6, nah2po4
0.33, na-pyruvate 5, glucose 10, mgcl2 1, cacl2 2, and
n - [2 - hydroxyethyl]piperazine-n'- [2-ethanesulphonic acid]
(hepes) 10, titrated to ph 7.4 with naoh. extracellular
solution for experiments using hek 293 cells contained (in
mm): kcl 70, nacl 70, mgcl2 2, cacl2 2, and hepes 10,
titrated to ph 7.4 with naoh. other reagents were added to
these solutions as described in the text.

electrophysiology
conventional patch pipettes were used in the whole-cell
con®guration to record from cardiac myocytes, and in excised
outside-out and inside-out patch con®gurations from hek
293 cells. voltage was controlled and membrane currents
recorded using an axopatch 200b ampli®er (axon instruments). currents were ®ltered at 2 or 5 khz and analogue
signals were collected and digitised using a digidata 1200
series interface. records were acquired and analysed using
either pclamp 8 (axon) or custom software, excel 2000
(microsoft) and sigmaplot 5.0 (jandel scienti®c). to allow
for variation in cell size whole-cell currents were normalized
to cell capacitance and expressed as pa pf71.
patch pipettes used to record from cardiac myocytes were
made from thin-walled borosilicate glass, ®lled with a
solution containing (in mm): kcl 140, mgcl2 1, atp 2,
adp 0.1, gtp 0.1, ethylene glycol-bis(b-aminoethyl ether)n,n,n',n'-tetraacetic acid (egta) 5, hepes 10, ph 7.2
and had resistances of 4 ± 6 mo when ®lled. experiments
were carried out at 32+28c. patch pipettes used to record
from hek 293 cells were made from thick-walled borosilicate
glass, ®re-polished and coated with sylgard (dow corning).
in the outside-out patch con®guration, pipettes were ®lled
with a (intracellular) solution containing (in mm): kcl 140,
atp 0.01, edta 10, hepes 10, ph 7.2 and had resistances
of 14 ± 18 mo when ®lled. in the inside-out patch con®guration, pipettes were ®lled with extracellular solution (as
described above) and the superfusing (intracellular) solution
was supplemented as described in the text. experiments on
hek 293 cells were carried out at room temperature,
22+28c.

drugs
pinacidil,  xxxd2215xxx ,  xxxd1868xxx , sodium cyanide, iodoacetic acid (iaa), and oligomycin (a mixture of oligomycins
a, b and c), were obtained from sigma. 2,4 dinitro-1¯uorobenzene (dnfb) was obtained from fluka. drugs were
dissolved in dimethylsulfoxide (dmso) (sigma) as stock
solutions and diluted in tyrode. dmso, at the maximum
concentration used of 0.1%, did not have any measurable
eect on the parameters studied.

data analysis
the katp current in  xxxd2203xxx  (i) was plotted as a fraction
of the katp current in its absence (ia) and data were ®t with
the hill equation:

where [g] is the  xxxd2203xxx  concentration, ic50 is the
 xxxd2203xxx  concentration that produces half-maximal inhibition and n is the slope factor (hill coecient). data are
presented as mean+s.e.mean and statistical signi®cance was
tested using student's paired or unpaired t-tests as appropriate, or a one-way anova followed by a dunnet's test
for multiple comparisons. a value of p50.05 was considered
signi®cant.

results
effect of  xxxd2203xxx  on pinacidil-activated whole-cell
katp currents in cardiac myocytes
whole-cell cardiac katp currents are rapidly activated by the
 xxxg1253xxx  opener pinacidil, and such pinacidil-activated
currents have been used to study block by the sulphonylurea
 xxxd2215xxx  (fosset et al., 1988; wilde & janse, 1994). we
used a similar strategy to investigate the blocking eect of
 xxxd2203xxx  on katp currents of rat cardiac myocytes. in the
whole-cell con®guration, myocytes were superfused with
normal tyrode, voltage-clamped initially at 765 mv and
then depolarized to a holding potential of 0 mv for the
duration of the experiment. under these conditions, with the
pipette solution containing 2 mm atp, katp channels are
mainly inhibited. addition of pinacidil (200 mm) to the
extracellular solution activated substantial katp current
(4.2+1.7 pa pf71, n=7 cells) and we measured  xxxd2203xxx 
block of this pinacidil-activated current (figure 1a).
 xxxd2203xxx  was added cumulatively, and no more than
three concentrations of  xxxd2203xxx  were applied to a single

current from a rat cardiac myocyte. (a) whole-cell katp current
recorded from a single rat cardiac myocyte voltage-clamped at 0 mv.
200 mm pinacidil activated a normalized whole-cell current of 4.78 pa
pf71. 3, 10 and 30 nm  xxxd2203xxx  reduced the whole-cell current in a
concentration-dependent manner and 10 mm  xxxd2215xxx  blocked
any remaining katp current. the superfusion protocol is shown

expressed as a fraction of the steady-state katp current (see
methods). the line is ®t to equation 1 of the text with ic50=6.8 nm
and a hill coecient of 1.4. data are mean+s.e.mean.

cell (figure 1a). at the conclusion of each experiment
 xxxd2215xxx  (10 mm) was added to the superfusate to block
all katp current and the katp current amplitude was taken
as the dierence between the steady-state pinacidil-activated
current and that in the presence of  xxxd2215xxx . in these
experiments signi®cant channel rundown did not occur. the
eects of  xxxd2203xxx  and  xxxd2215xxx  were not substantially reversible over the time scale of our experiments, and so
no attempt was made to wash them o. figure 1b shows the
mean concentration ± inhibition curve for  xxxd2203xxx , plotted
as a fraction of the maximal katp current, which is well ®t
by equation (1) giving an ic50 of 6.8+0.1 nm and a hill
coecient of 1.4+0.2 (n=6). these results suggest that
 xxxd2203xxx  is a very potent inhibitor of rat cardiac katp
currents activated by pinacidil.

effect of  xxxd2203xxx  on cloned katp channels
( xxxg1250xxx /sur2a) expressed in hek 293 cells
to investigate the eect of  xxxd2203xxx  on the  xxxg1253xxx 
without eects from other intracellular factors we recorded
katp currents from cloned  xxxg1253xxx  subunits. the
cardiac-type sarcolemmal  xxxg1253xxx  is a heteromultimer
composed of  xxxg1250xxx /sur2a subunits (isomoto et al., 1996;
gribble et al., 1998; giblin et al., 1999). we recorded katp
currents from hek 293 cells stably expressing these subunits.
membrane patches were excised in the outside-out con®guration and the pipette solution contained 10 mm mgatp to
maintain channel activity. this atp concentration was
chosen because the mean ki for atp, which we determined
previously for cloned cardiac katp currents ( xxxg1250xxx /sur2a)
in hek 293 cells was 19.0+0.04 mm (n=4), thus a pipette
solution containing 10 mm atp allows substantial activation
of the current. furthermore, we have observed that in the
absence of atp  xxxd2215xxx  has no eect on channel
activity, as has also been reported by gribble et al. (1998).
the katp current dominates endogenous currents in hek
293 cells stably expressing the subunits,  xxxg1250xxx /sur2a, and
so the current recorded immediately after patch excision,
when katp channels are still inhibited by residual intracellular atp, was de®ned as the zero-current baseline. the
katp current develops spontaneously as the internal face of
the membrane patch is dialyzed with 10 mm atp and is fully
activated in less than 1 min.
figure 2a shows several current-voltage relationships
recorded from a single outside-out patch in the absence and
presence of  xxxd2203xxx  (3, 30, 100 and 300 nm). patches were
held at 720 mv, close to ek, and pulsed from 780 to
+80 mv in 10 mv steps for 100 ms at 1 hz. in this patch
block of katp current appeared to be near-maximal at 30 nm
 xxxd2203xxx  since the i/v relationships of 30, 100 and 300 nm
 xxxd2203xxx  are superimposed. a concentration ± inhibition
curve was constructed from the average current amplitude of
10 pulses stepped to 780 mv from a holding potential of
720 mv for each concentration (figure 2b). each patch was
exposed to a maximum of ®ve concentrations of  xxxd2203xxx 
applied in increasing concentrations. the ic50 (equation 1)
for  xxxd2203xxx  on cloned  xxxg1253xxx  currents in hek 293
cells was 6.2+0.1 nm with a hill coecient of 1.2+0.1
(n=4). this ic50 for  xxxd2203xxx  on cloned katp channels is
strikingly similar to that for native katp currents of rat
cardiac myocytes (6.8 nm) even though native cardiac katp

 xxxd2215xxx  is signi®cantly less eective during periods of
metabolic stress. we therefore investigated whether block by
 xxxd2203xxx  is similarly aected. to induce metabolic
inhibition (mi) we used substrate-free tyrode (without
pyruvate or glucose) with 0.5 mm iaa to inhibit glycolysis
and 1 mm cn7 to uncouple mitochondrial respiration. mi
activated a maximal outward current of 40.7+6.1 pa pf71
(n=7) as shown in figure 3b.
we compared the eect of  xxxd2203xxx   xxxd1891xxx  mm on katp
currents induced by pinacidil and by mi (figure 3). as
expected from the concentration ± inhibition curve in figure

currents were evoked by decreasing atpi to 10 mm (n=4). the katp
current in  xxxd2203xxx  is expressed as a fraction of the katp current
(see methods). the line is ®t to equation 1 of the text with
ic50=6.2 nm and a hill coecient of 1.2. the  xxxd2203xxx

channels were activated by pinacidil and cloned cardiac katp
channels were activated by atp depletion.

 xxxd2203xxx  inhibition of native katp currents activated
by metabolic inhibition and  xxxd1868xxx 
the open probability of katp channels is increased under
conditions of metabolic stress, such as myocardial ischaemia,
and the activation of these channels during ischaemia has
been suggested to protect cells against reperfusion injury.
thus it is important to evaluate  xxxg1253xxx  block by
sulphonylureas when metabolism is compromised. interestingly, findlay (1993) has shown that  xxxg1253xxx  block by

1b, 10 mm  xxxd2203xxx  induced near-complete block, 99%, of
pinacidil-activated katp current though a small additional
component of current comprising about 1% of the total was
inhibited by the addition of 10 mm  xxxd2215xxx  (figure 3a).
the fractional pinacidil-activated current in 10 mm  xxxd2203xxx  was 0.01+0.01 (n=7, figure 3c). figure 3b, c show that
 xxxd2203xxx  was much less eective in blocking katp currents
induced by mi. the fractional mi-induced katp current in
10 mm  xxxd2203xxx  was 0.30+0.03 (n=8; p50.001 compared
to block of the pinacidil-activated current) corresponding to
70% block of the current (figure 3c).
in view of these dierences, we investigated  xxxd2203xxx 
block of katp currents activated by a third procedure. the
 xxxg1253xxx  opener  xxxd1868xxx  has been proposed to show
selectivity for cardiac mitochondrial over sarcolemmal katp
channels (garlid et al., 1997; liu et al., 1998). however,
under certain conditions, such as those that might be
expected to develop during myocardial ischaemia,  xxxd1868xxx 
can also activate sarcolemmal katp channels (d'hahan et
al., 1999). a dominant aspect of ischaemia or a metabolically-compromised environment is an increase in intracellular
adp (adpi) together with a decrease in atpi. (jennings &
reimer, 1991). intracellular adp antagonizes the atpinduced inhibition of katp channels (terzic et al., 1995)
and has been suggested to serve as an essential cofactor for
 xxxd1868xxx  activation of sarcolemmal katp channels (d'hahan et al., 1999). the intracellular concentration of adp can
be raised by applying 2,4 dinitro-1-¯uorobenzene (dnfb), a
creatine kinase inhibitor which prevents the phosphorylation
of 90% of cellular adp, together with oligomycin, the
mitochondrial atp-synthase inhibitor.
we therefore used the combination of dnfb, oligomycin
and  xxxd1868xxx  to investigate  xxxg1253xxx  activation and its
subsequent block by  xxxd2203xxx . cells were incubated for
5 min with oligomycin (5 mg ml71), then voltage-clamped at
0 mv and superfused for 5 min with dnfb (100 mm).
generally, 5-min superfusion with dnfb alone did not
cause an increase in baseline current at 0 mv, however in
some cells a modest increase in current was observed.
subsequent application of  xxxd1868xxx  (300 mm) activated an
outward current of 39.1+9.2 pa pf71 (n=6). this was
reduced by  xxxd2203xxx  (10 mm) to a fractional current of
0.18+0.04 (n=6; p50.005 compared to pinacidil-activated
current, figure 3c), corresponding to 82% block by
 xxxd2203xxx . thus,  xxxd2203xxx  was a less eective blocker
when the katp current was activated by either mi (70%
block) or partial mi+ xxxd1868xxx  (82% block) compared to
pinacidil (99% block). as both mi and the combination of
inhibitors together with  xxxd1868xxx  lead to a rise in adpi
(d'hahan et al., 1999), it may be that elevated adpi
interferes with the blocking eect of  xxxd2203xxx  on the katp
channel (findlay, 1993).

the effect of intracellular adp on  xxxd2203xxx  and
 xxxd2215xxx  block of cloned katp channels
to investigate the possibility that an increase in adpi
reduces the eectiveness of  xxxd2203xxx  block on katp
channels we used inside-out patches excised from hek 293
cells expressing the  xxxg1253xxx . inside-out rather than
outside-out patches were used so that we could apply
dierent concentrations of adp to the intracellular face of
british journal of pharmacology vol 136 (5)

 xxxd2203xxx  block of cardiac katp channels

the same patch. adp (0, 1, 10 or 100 mm) was applied in
decreasing concentrations, together with either  xxxd2203xxx  or
 xxxd2215xxx  (100 nm), while cytoplasmic atp was kept
constant  xxxd1891xxx  mm. currents were recorded for 100 ms during
steps to 780 mv as described above. figure 4 shows that
increasing intracellular adp substantially and progressively
reduced  xxxd2203xxx  block of katp current. as adp
increased, the fractional katp current in 100 nm  xxxd2203xxx 
increased signi®cantly from 0.21+0.02 in the absence of adp
to 0.71+0.06 at 100 mm adp (n=6; p50.05 vs control). in
these experiments using inside-out patches the fractional
katp current in 100 nm  xxxd2203xxx  at 0.21+0.02 was greater
than that measured previously from outside-out patches
(0.04+0.04) and shown in figure 2b. this apparent
dierence in the extent of sulphonylurea block of katp
channels has been noted previously (lawrence et al., 2001)
and may re¯ect a decrease in the rate at which sulphonylureas can access their receptor from the inside. these results
show that  xxxd2203xxx  becomes increasingly less eective at
blocking cloned katp channels as intracellular adp
increases. in contrast, the presence of adp had little impact
on the inhibitory eect of  xxxd2215xxx  on katp current
(n=6 patches). the fractional katp current in  xxxd2215xxx 
in the absence of adp was not signi®cantly dierent from
that in 1, 10 or 100 mm adp.

discussion
in this study we have investigated the eects of  xxxd2203xxx 
on native and recombinant ( xxxg1250xxx /sur2a) katp channels
in rat ventricular myocytes and hek 293 cells. our data
show that  xxxd2203xxx  is a very eective blocker of native and
cloned cardiac sarcolemmal katp channels. our results from
experiments on both native and cloned cells suggest that
 xxxd2203xxx  block of katp channels is increasingly overcome
as intracellular adp rises.

 xxxd2203xxx  block of katp channels under
physiological conditions
we ®nd that  xxxd2203xxx  blocks both native and cloned
cardiac katp channels with high anity (ic50s of 6.8 and
6.2 nm, respectively). these results are consistent with those
of song & ashcroft (2001) who reported an ic50 of 5.4 nm
for  xxxd2203xxx  in xenopus oocytes expressing  xxxg1250xxx /sur2a
subunits. the similarity of ic50s between native and cloned
channels suggest that the eect of  xxxd2203xxx  in native cells is
solely derived from its eect on the  xxxg1253xxx . the ic50
for  xxxd2203xxx  on pinacidil-activated cardiac katp channels
is also similar to that for  xxxd2215xxx  (7.9 nm) measured in
the same way (lawrence et al., 2001). thus,  xxxd2203xxx 
appears to be equipotent to  xxxd2215xxx  as a blocker of
native katp channels in cardiac myocytes and cloned katp
channels in hek 293 cells (shown here) or in oocytes
(gribble et al., 1998).

 xxxd2203xxx  block of katp channels is reduced in the
presence of elevated intracellular adp
while katp currents activated by pinacidil were almost
completely blocked (99%) by 10 mm  xxxd2203xxx , the degree
of block was considerably less (70%) when currents were
activated by metabolic inhibition. these results are in
agreement with suggestions that nucleoside diphosphates
antagonize atpi and sulphonylurea-induced  xxxg1253xxx 
inhibition, or may even increase channel activity by
increasing the time spent in intraburst, ligand-insensitive
states (terzic et al., 1995; nichols et al., 1996; alekseev et al.,
1998; gribble et al., 1998). we would expect adpi to be
increased under the conditions used in this study to induce
metabolic inhibition. in hek 293 cells expressing cardiac
 xxxg1253xxx  subunits we found that increasing adpi in the
presence of  xxxd2203xxx  caused an increase in  xxxg1253xxx 
activity. these results are consistent with adpi relieving
block by  xxxd2203xxx  and suggest that the sulphonylurea
binding site and the nucleotide-binding domains of sur2a
interact (nichols et al., 1996). interestingly, we did not
observe marked relief of  xxxd2215xxx  block by metabolic
inhibition in cardiac myocytes (figure 3), though findlay
(1993) has reported such relief induced by long-term
treatment with 2,4 dinitrophenol. ripoll et al. (1993) have
reported that adp, in the presence of 2 mm mg2+,
antagonizes the blocking action of  xxxd2215xxx , however,
in the absence of mg2+  xxxd2215xxx  block of katp current
is maintained. as our experiments were conducted in the
absence of intracellular mg2+, our ®ndings are in close
agreement with those of ripoll et al. (1993). it has also been
suggested that  xxxg1253xxx  sensitivity to sulphonylureas,

 xxxd2203xxx  block of cardiac katp channels

such as  xxxd2215xxx , is dependent on the gating state of the
channel. in the presence of dinucleotides, the ligandinsensitive state (alekseev et al., 1998) may be prolonged,
therefore decreasing the inhibitory eect of  xxxd2215xxx . it
is likely that channel block by  xxxd2203xxx  is similarly aected
by the raised adp levels in our experiments and is more
sensitive than  xxxd2215xxx . thus block by  xxxd2203xxx  may
be more readily relieved by adpi than that by  xxxd2215xxx .
consistent with this, block of cloned channels by  xxxd2215xxx  was unaected by changing adpi over the range 0 ±
100 mm. this contrasts with the work of gribble et al. (1998),
a dierence that may relate to our use of a mammalian rather
than a xenopus expression system.

possible therapeutic significance
several studies have suggested that  xxxd2203xxx , used for the
treatment of type 2 diabetes, may give better glycaemic
control and aect cardiovascular variables less than does
 xxxd2215xxx  (sonnenberg et al., 1997; langtry & balfour,
1998; riddle & schneider, 1998; schade et al., 1998; elreyani et al., 1999). it has also been shown recently that
 xxxd2203xxx , unlike  xxxd2215xxx , does not abolish the
cardioprotective eects of ipc (klepzig et al., 1999; mocanu
et al., 2001). a possible explanation for these ®ndings is that
the observed protection is conferred by mitochondrial, rather
than sarcolemmal, katp channels (grover & garlid, 2000)
and that these channels are unaected by  xxxd2203xxx .
however recent work suggests that sarcolemmal katp
channels also play an important role in the cardioprotection
elicited by ipc (toyoda et al., 2000; sanada et al., 2001;
tanno et al., 2001). our results are consistent with such a
suggestion. during myocardial ischaemia, adpi rises (weiss
et al., 1992) and we show that  xxxd2203xxx  becomes a less
eective blocker of sarcolemmal katp channels under such
conditions.
we conclude that  xxxd2203xxx  is equipotent to  xxxd2215xxx  as a blocker of both native and cloned cardiac
sarcolemmal katp channels under normal physiological
conditions. however,  xxxd2203xxx  block is reduced under
conditions of metabolic inhibition in cardiac myocytes and
when adpi is elevated at the cytoplasmic face of cloned
channels. a reduction in the blocking eect of  xxxd2203xxx  on
sarcolemmal katp channels under ischaemic conditions may
contribute to its observed failure to block the cardioprotection induced by ischaemic preconditioning.
