glucosamine inhibits  xxxg1170xxx -induced  xxxg1559xxx  activation in human osteoarthritic chondrocytes.  glucosamine sulfate (gs) is a commonly used drug for the treatment of osteoarthritis. the mechanism of the action of this drug does, however, remain to be elucidated. in human osteoarthritic chondrocytes (hoc) stimulated with a proinflammatory cytokine, we studied whether gs could modify the  xxxg1559xxx  activity and the expression of cox-2, a  xxxg1559xxx -dependent gene.
