summary. background: agents that act as antagonists at
 xxxg1645xxx  adp receptors on platelets are in use (clopidogrel),
and in development for use ( xxxd423xxx  and prasugrel), in
patients with cardiovascular disease.  xxxd423xxx  is a direct-acting
reversible antagonist being developed for short-term infusion;
clopidogrel and prasugrel are oral prodrugs that provide
irreversible inhibition via transient formation of active metabolites. at the cessation of  xxxd423xxx  infusion, patients are likely
to receive clopidogrel or prasugrel as a means of maintaining
antiplatelet therapy. objectives: to apply an experimental
in vitro approach to investigate the possibility that  xxxd423xxx 
inﬂuences the ability of the active metabolites of clopidogrel and
prasugrel to inhibit adp-mediated platelet function. methods:
the eﬀects of  xxxd423xxx  and the active metabolites of clopidogrel (c-am) and prasugrel (p-am) on platelet function were
assessed by adp-induced platelet  xxxg2049xxx  expression in whole
blood. the method involved rapid removal of the antagonists
by dilution, and measurement of residual platelet inhibition.
results:  xxxd423xxx , c-am and p-am markedly inhibited pselectin expression. the eﬀect of  xxxd423xxx , but not of c-am
and p-am, was reversible following antagonist removal.
preincubation of blood with  xxxd423xxx  prior to addition of cam or p-am reduced the ability of metabolites to irreversibly
antagonize  xxxg1645xxx . irreversible inhibition was maintained when
blood was preincubated with metabolites prior to  xxxd423xxx .
conclusions:  xxxd423xxx  inﬂuences the ability of the active
metabolites of clopidogrel or prasugrel to inhibit platelet
function irreversibly. careful consideration should be given to
the timing of administration of an oral  xxxg1645xxx  antagonist
following  xxxd423xxx  infusion.

introduction
adp is an important contributor to thrombotic disease [1]. it
acts via two types of purinergic receptors on platelets, p2y1
and  xxxg1645xxx , producing platelet activation and platelet aggregation [2]. activation of both types of receptor is needed for a full
platelet response, and antagonists that act at either p2y1 or
 xxxg1645xxx  receptors markedly reduce the effects of adp on platelet
function and thus have potential as antithrombotic drugs [3].
clopidogrel is a prodrug that inhibits platelet function via
antagonism of  xxxg1645xxx  receptors. it is administered orally and is
converted to an active metabolite that, although present only
relatively transiently in vivo, interacts irreversibly with the
 xxxg1645xxx  receptor on platelets, thus producing long-term inhibition of platelet function [4,5]. clopidogrel is widely used as an
antithrombotic agent for the treatment of patients with
established cardiovascular disease [6].
several other agents that act as antagonists of  xxxg1645xxx 
receptors are in development as potential antithrombotic
drugs. these include  xxxd423xxx  and prasugrel [3].  xxxd423xxx 
(previously known as ar-c69931) is a  xxxg1645xxx  antagonist that
differs from clopidogrel in that it is a direct-acting, reversible
and short-acting inhibitor of platelet  xxxg1645xxx  receptor [7]. it is
being developed as an infusible agent for use during percutaneous coronary interventions (pcis) and in patients with acute
coronary syndromes [8]. during infusion,  xxxd423xxx  provides
rapid, dose-dependent inhibition of platelet aggregation that is
rapidly terminated when infusion ceases [9].
prasugrel, like clopidogrel, is an orally administered
prodrug. its active metabolite r-138727 (p-am) interacts
irreversibly with the  xxxg1645xxx  receptor on platelets [10,11].
prasugrel is currently being developed as a potential alternative
to clopidogrel. it has been shown to be more potent and have a
faster onset of action than clopidogrel in preclinical [10,12] and
early clinical studies [13,14]. additional studies both in
healthy volunteers and in stable and unstable cardiac patients

1154 n. l. dovlatova et al

demonstrated less variability in the antiplatelet effect following
the loading dose of prasugrel (60 mg) as compared to
clopidogrel (300 and 600 mg) [15–18]. the potential advantage
of prasugrel is that p-am seems to be produced more
efﬁciently than the clopidogrel active metabolite, thus allowing
for more rapid and more complete inhibition of platelet
function following oral administration [16,19].
it is likely that patients who receive acute intravenous
therapy with a  xxxg1645xxx  antagonist (e.g. with  xxxd423xxx ) will
receive follow-up oral maintenance therapy (e.g. with clopidogrel or potentially prasugrel). accordingly, the following
question arises: does the presence on the  xxxg1645xxx  receptor of
the direct-acting and reversible antagonist  xxxd423xxx  inﬂuence
the ability of the active metabolite of clopidogrel or of prasugrel
to bind to those receptors and inhibit platelet function?
recently, the results of an interventional study were
published which suggest that this may well be the case [20].
the study involved administration of  xxxd423xxx  and clopidogrel
to healthy volunteers, following which their effects on platelet
function were determined.  xxxd423xxx  and clopidogrel administered alone achieved the expected levels of platelet inhibition.
however, the sustained platelet inhibition anticipated for
clopidogrel treatment did not occur when  xxxd423xxx  and
clopidogrel were administered simultaneously; on withdrawal
of both treatments, platelet function recovered within 1 h. in
contrast, when clopidogrel was administered orally upon
completion of the  xxxd423xxx  infusion, there was a transient
recovery in platelet function as the inhibitory effect of the
 xxxd423xxx  disappeared, followed by further inhibition as the
clopidogrel was metabolized to its active form.
the results of the in vitro experiments that we have
performed in the current investigation provide a mechanistic
explanation for the ﬁndings in the above paper, and also show
that there is the possibility of a parallel scenario arising when
prasugrel is used in place of clopidogrel.
materials and methods
materials

adp was purchased from the sigma chemical co. (poole,
uk). the selective  xxxg1645xxx  antagonist ar-c69931 ( xxxd423xxx )
was a gift from astrazeneca (charnwood, loughborough,
uk). the active metabolite of clopidogrel (r-361015, c-am)
and the active metabolite of prasugrel (r-138727, p-am) were
provided by daiichi sankyo co. ltd (tokyo, japan) and eli
lilly and company (indianapolis, in, usa). solutions of
 xxxd423xxx  were prepared in saline ( xxxd3213xxx , 0.9% w/v),
which was from baxter healthcare ltd (thetford, uk), and
solutions of c-am and p-am were prepared in 0.1% (w/v)
dimethylsulfoxide. sodium citrate was prepared as a 3.13% (w/
v) solution of trisodium citrate dihydrate and was used at a
ratio of 1 : 9 of blood.
in some experiments, hirudin was used in place of citrate;
this was recombinant desulfato-hirudin, revasctm, a gift from
novartis (basel, switzerland), used at a concentration of

50 lg ml)1. the ﬁxing solution used during the  xxxg2049xxx 
assay was a formulation especially designed to stabilize the
surface-expressed  xxxg2049xxx  prior to subsequent experimentation and analysis, and was added in a 2 : 1 ratio to the cell
suspension [21]. speciﬁc antibodies,  xxxg1210xxx -percp (to identify
the platelet population) and isotypic igg [ﬂuorescein isothiocyanate (fitc)], were obtained from becton dickinson
(oxford, uk), and  xxxg2049xxx -fitc antibody (against  xxxg2049xxx )
was from serotec (oxford, uk).
blood collection

venous blood was obtained from healthy volunteers after full
ethical permission had been obtained from the local ethics
board. volunteers denied taking any medication in the 2 weeks
prior to donation. blood was taken by forearm venepuncture
using a polypropylene syringe and 19 g needle, and dispensed
into polystyrene tubes containing sodium citrate as anticoagulant. (in some experiments, hirudin was used in place of
sodium citrate.)
platelet-free plasma (pfp) was prepared by centrifuging the
autologous whole blood at 180 · g) for 10 min to obtain
platelet-rich plasma and then at 900 ·g for 20 min to obtain
platelet-poor plasma (ppp). the ppp was aspirated and
subsequently ﬁltered twice through a polyethersulfone highﬂow ﬁlter (sartorius, germany) with a pore diameter of 0.2 lm
to provide the pfp.
incubation with  xxxg1645xxx  antagonists and measurement of
 xxxg2049xxx  expression

whole blood samples were incubated with either  xxxd423xxx , cam or p-am for 30 min. otherwise, blood samples were
incubated with  xxxd423xxx  for 15 min and c-am or p-am was
added for a further 15 min. alternatively, samples were
incubated with c-am or p-am for 15 min and  xxxd423xxx  was
added for a further 15 min. preliminary data had indicated that
15 min provided sufﬁcient time for all three  xxxg1645xxx  antagonists
to exert a full effect on platelet function at the concentrations
that were chosen for this study. samples that contained vehicle
in place of the drug(s) were routinely used as controls.
following incubation with the  xxxg1645xxx  antagonists, aliquots of
the blood were stimulated with adp (10 lm) for 4 min. in
parallel, aliquots of the blood were diluted one hundred-fold
using autologous pfp prior to stimulation with adp (10 lm)
for 4 min. the adp was added either 10 or 30 min after the
dilution. after adp stimulation, the samples were treated with
ﬁxative solution for 30 min. platelets in the undiluted/ﬁxed
samples were directly stained using the monoclonal antibodies
 xxxg2049xxx -fitc and  xxxg1210xxx -percp for 30 min in the dark. the
diluted/ﬁxed samples were centrifuged for 5 min at 900 ·g, the
supernatant was removed, and the pellet was resuspended in a
small volume of saline prior to staining with the same antibodies.
 xxxg2049xxx  expression ( xxxg2049xxx ) on platelets was measured by
ﬂow cytometry (lsr ii; becton dickinson). the ﬂow cytometer was equipped with a solid-state blue laser operating at
 2008 international society on thrombosis and haemostasis

interactions between  xxxg1645xxx  antagonists 1155

20 mw power at a wavelength of 488 nm and connected to a
hewlett packard computer with facsdiva acquisition software.  xxxg2049xxx  ( xxxg2049xxx ) was quantitated as the median
ﬂuorescence of 3000 platelets, which were identiﬁed by their
 xxxg1210xxx  positivity. the data were expressed as mean ± sd.
statistical analyses were via use of the paired two-tailed t-test,
and a p-value of < 0.01 was accepted as statistically signiﬁcant.
results
effects of  xxxd423xxx , c-am and p-am on adp-induced
 xxxg2049xxx  expression on platelets

initial experiments demonstrated that the  xxxg1645xxx  antagonist
 xxxd423xxx  used at a concentration of 0.1 lm markedly inhibited
 xxxg2049xxx  expression on platelets induced by 10 lm adp
(p < 0.01) (fig. 1). likewise, c-am and p-am used at a
concentration of 10 lm inhibited  xxxg2049xxx  expression to a
similar degree (each p < 0.01) (fig. 1). when  xxxd423xxx  was
used at one hundred-fold lower concentration (0.001 lm) and
c-am or p-am at ten-fold lower concentration (1.0 lm), no
signiﬁcant inhibitory effect of these agents on adp-induced pselectin expression was observed.
from these initial results, we concluded that by dilution one
hundred-fold of blood samples that had been incubated with
 xxxd423xxx  (0.1 lm), c-am (10 lm) or p-am (10 lm), the
concentration of the antagonists would be reduced to a level
that would not cause any signiﬁcant inhibition of adp-induced
 xxxg2049xxx  expression.
effect of dilution of blood samples on the inhibition of adpinduced  xxxg2049xxx  expression by  xxxd423xxx , c-am or p-am

in the next series of experiments, blood samples that had been
preincubated with  xxxd423xxx  (0.1 lm), c-am (10 lm) or p-am
(10 lm) for 30 min were stimulated with 10 lm adp before
and 10 min after being diluted one hundred-fold (fig. 2).

again, we saw marked inhibition of  xxxg2049xxx  expression by
each of the antagonists before dilution. after dilution of the
blood samples containing  xxxd423xxx ,  xxxg2049xxx  expression
increased signiﬁcantly (p < 0.01), which would be expected,
as this antagonist is known to act in a reversible way. in
contrast, after dilution of the blood samples containing p-am
or c-am,  xxxg2049xxx  expression remained at the level present
before dilution and  xxxg2049xxx  expression was signiﬁcantly lower
than in the diluted sample incubated with  xxxd423xxx 
(p < 0.01). again, this would be expected using antagonists
that are known to act in an irreversible manner.
by using the described model, we established that measurement of adp-induced  xxxg2049xxx  expression could be used to
distinguish between the effects of reversible ( xxxd423xxx ) and
irreversible (c-am and p-am)  xxxg1645xxx  antagonists. our next
step was to assess the potential ability of the reversible  xxxg1645xxx 
antagonist ( xxxd423xxx ) to inﬂuence the effects of an irreversible
 xxxg1645xxx  antagonist (c-am or p-am).
influence of  xxxd423xxx  on the abilities of c-am and p-am
to inhibit adp-induced  xxxg2049xxx  expression

in these experiments, blood samples were incubated with
0.1 lm  xxxd423xxx  alone for 30 min, or 10 lm c-am alone for
30 min, or with the combination of  xxxd423xxx  and c-am
(fig. 3a). when using the combination of drugs, the following
conditions were compared: (i) blood was incubated with
 xxxd423xxx  for 15 min, after which c-am was added for a
further 15 min; and (ii) blood was incubated with c-am for
15 min, when  xxxd423xxx  was added for a further 15 min.
following these incubations,  xxxg2049xxx  expression was measured in response to 10 lm adp before and 10 min after a one
hundred-fold dilution of the blood sample. identical experiments were performed using 0.1 lm  xxxd423xxx  and 10 lm
p-am alone and in combination (fig. 3b).
before dilution of the blood samples,  xxxg2049xxx  expression
was similar irrespective of whether  xxxd423xxx  and c-am or

fig. 2. effect of one hundred-fold dilution of blood samples on adp-induced  xxxg2049xxx  following pretreatment with 0.1 lm  xxxd423xxx , 10 lm c-am
or 10 lm p-am. part of the blood samples containing  xxxd423xxx , c-am or p-am was stimulated with 10 lm adp before dilution. the other part was
diluted one hundred-fold with platelet-free plasma and left for 10 min prior to stimulation by 10 lm adp. results are median ﬂuorescence and are
mean ± sd, n = 5. *p < 0.01 as compared with the undiluted sample containing  xxxd423xxx ; **p < 0.01 as compared with the sample diluted after
pretreatment with  xxxd423xxx .

 xxxd423xxx  and p-am had been used alone or in combination.
all the values reﬂected marked inhibition of adp-induced pselectin expression by the agents used alone or in combination.
as before, after dilution of the blood samples that had been
incubated with a single antagonist, signiﬁcantly higher levels of
 xxxg2049xxx  were generated following the incubation with  xxxd423xxx  alone, again reﬂecting the reversibility of the inhibition
brought about by  xxxd423xxx .
after dilution of the blood samples that had been incubated
with the combination of  xxxd423xxx  and c-am (fig. 3a), the
amount of  xxxg2049xxx  generated was found to depend on the
order of addition of the  xxxg1645xxx  antagonists. when  xxxd423xxx 
was added before c-am, the amount of  xxxg2049xxx  generated in
response to adp after dilution was increased and was similar
to that seen following dilution of the sample treated with
 xxxd423xxx  alone. when  xxxd423xxx  was added after c-am, the
amount of  xxxg2049xxx  generated in response to adp after
dilution was not increased. very similar results were obtained
in experiments in which p-am was used in place of c-am
(fig. 3b).
all the above experiments were performed in blood collected
using sodium citrate as the anticoagulant. to be sure that the
use of citrate was not creating a non-physiological environment
that would render the results of our investigations irrelevant to
the clinical situation, we repeated these experiments using
blood collected using hirudin rather than citrate. identical
results were obtained irrespective of the anticoagulant used
(results not shown).
influence of different concentrations of  xxxd423xxx  on the
abilities of c-am and p-am to inhibit adp-induced  xxxg2049xxx 
expression

these experiments were performed in a similar fashion to those
described above. blood was incubated with  xxxd423xxx  alone for

30 min and also with  xxxd423xxx  for 15 min followed by c-am
(fig. 4a) or p-am (fig. 4b) for a further 15 min. three
different concentrations of  xxxd423xxx  were used: 0.001 lm,
0.01 lm and 0.1 lm. in these experiments, adp-induced pselectin expression was measured before and 30 min after
dilution of the samples.
 xxxd423xxx  used alone showed a concentration-dependent
inhibitory effect on adp-induced  xxxg2049xxx  expression (fig. 4a,b). after these samples were diluted, the inhibitory effect of
the drug was reversed. when c-am was added to the blood
samples pretreated with 0.001 lm and 0.01 lm  xxxd423xxx , pselectin expression was additionally inhibited and fell to the
same level as in the sample containing 0.1 lm  xxxd423xxx 
(fig. 4a). upon dilution of the samples incubated with a
combination of the antagonists,  xxxg2049xxx  expression increased
proportionally to the  xxxd423xxx  concentration. the higher the
concentration of  xxxd423xxx , the more reversible was the
inhibition of adp-induced  xxxg2049xxx  expression. similar
results were obtained when  xxxd423xxx  was combined with
p-am (fig. 4b).
discussion
the aim of this investigation was to perform experimental
studies to look for interactions between different types of  xxxg1645xxx 
antagonists that might lead to alterations in their effectiveness
as inhibitors of platelet function. knowledge of such interactions might inﬂuence the way in which such agents are
administered in clinical practice.
the approach that we chose to assess  xxxg1645xxx  blockade was by
measurement of  xxxg2049xxx  expression on platelets stimulated
with adp.  xxxg2049xxx  is a well-established marker of platelet
activation and is particularly suited to the studies that were
performed. we have found that levels of  xxxg2049xxx  on the
surface of platelets can be made stable following appropriate

ﬁxation of blood samples, despite further experimental manipulation.
we ﬁrst established that adp-induced  xxxg2049xxx  expression
is markedly inhibited in the presence of  xxxg1645xxx  antagonists
( xxxd423xxx , c-am or p-am), conﬁrming the importance of the
 xxxg1645xxx  receptor in this particular measure of platelet function.
 xxxg2049xxx  thus resembles other measures of platelet function
such as glycoproteiniib/iiia activation and platelet aggregation, which also require the presence of  xxxg1645xxx  receptors for a
full response to adp [22].
we also established that we could use measurements of
adp-induced  xxxg2049xxx  expression to distinguish between the
effects of an antagonist that acts in a reversible way ( xxxd423xxx )
and an antagonist that acts in an irreversible manner (c-am or
p-am). we achieved this by an approach that involved
reducing the concentration of free antagonist (by diluting the
sample) following incubation of platelets with the antagonist
 2008 international society on thrombosis and haemostasis

under investigation prior to platelet activation with adp. the
inhibitory effect of the reversible antagonist was markedly
reduced by this procedure, whereas the effects of the irreversible
antagonists were not. we were thus in a position to study the
ability of the reversible  xxxg1645xxx  antagonist ( xxxd423xxx ) to
inﬂuence the effects of an irreversible  xxxg1645xxx  antagonist
(c-am or p-am).
the experiments that were performed clearly showed that
such interactions do occur and that  xxxd423xxx  can limit the
ability of c-am or p-am to act as irreversible inhibitors of
platelet function. the extent to which it does so depends on the
concentration of  xxxd423xxx  present. presumably, occupation of
the  xxxg1645xxx  receptors on platelets by  xxxd423xxx  results in the
clopidogrel or prasugrel metabolite being unable to occupy the
receptor and allow the necessary covalent bond [4,23,24] with
the receptor to be formed and irreversible antagonism at the
receptor to be achieved.

diluted one hundred-fold with platelet-free plasma and left for 30 min prior to stimulation by 10 lm adp. results are percentage increase in median
ﬂuorescence brought about by adp and are mean ± sd, n = 5. (b) as above, except that 10 lm p-am was used instead of 10 lm c-am. mean ± sd,
n = 5.

such interactions may well have clinical relevance.  xxxd423xxx 
is a relatively potent  xxxg1645xxx  antagonist that is being developed
for intensive intravenous use, for example, during pci
procedures, when the threat of acute stent thrombosis is very
high. however, following  xxxd423xxx  infusion, there will need to
be a transition from intravenous therapy to oral therapy, and
our data suggest that the timing and sequence of the
discontinuation of  xxxd423xxx  and the start of oral therapy
may be important to ensure continued  xxxg1645xxx  blockade.
if, for example, oral therapy was initiated early such that
 xxxd423xxx  was still present at a high concentration at the time
that the active metabolite of clopidogrel or prasugrel appeared
in the blood, irreversible blockade of  xxxg1645xxx  would not occur

and the full effect of the oral therapy might not be achieved
until a later second dose of drug was administered. if, on the
other hand, there was a time gap between  xxxd423xxx  being
discontinued and oral therapy being initiated, there would be a
period when no  xxxg1645xxx  blockade was being achieved. indeed,
both of these scenarios were evident in the interventional study
with  xxxd423xxx  and clopidogrel that was recently reported [20].
it must be remembered that all the work performed here was
in vitro with active metabolites, and the results obtained take
no account of the doses of the prodrugs that are administered,
their rates of metabolism, and the possibility of different results
being obtained in actual patients. clearly further clinical
investigations will need to be performed to establish the

interactions between  xxxg1645xxx  antagonists 1159

optimum procedures needed to effect transfer from intravenous
 xxxg1645xxx  blockade to that achieved following oral therapy.
however, in view of our ﬁndings and the ﬁrst in vivo results
obtained by steinhubl et al. [20], we believe that it might be
prudent to delay the transfer from intravenous to oral
treatment until after the critical period during which it is
considered that  xxxg1645xxx  blockade is deemed to be providing
most clinical beneﬁt.
