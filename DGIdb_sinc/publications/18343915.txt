abstract
some useful therapeutic agents inhibit certain carbonic anhydrase (ca) isozymes to varying degrees. we have conducted
enzyme kinetics studies in a 4-nitrophenyl acetate (4-npa) hydrolysis assay with the marketed antiepileptic drugs topiramate
(1) and  xxxd3564xxx  (2) to determine if their full inhibition of human  xxxg293xxx  and  xxxg287xxx  requires extended preincubation
conditions. we found that neither 1 nor 2 requires appreciable preincubation with either enzyme to manifest full inhibitory
activity. we also examined the sulfamide cognate of topiramate (3) to characterize its ca inhibitory activity, and confirmed
that it is a very weak inhibitor, unlike 1 or 2. in a co2 hydration assay, 3 behaved as a very weak, partial inhibitor of  xxxg293xxx  and
 xxxg287xxx . we conclude that topiramate (1),  xxxd3564xxx  (2), and sulfamide 3 do not require extended exposure to human  xxxg287xxx  or
 xxxg293xxx  to manifest full inhibitory activity (4-npa assay).

introduction
carbonic anhydrases (cas) are important enzymes
that have attracted considerable interest [1,2]. given
the roles of cas in many physiological and pathophysiological processes, ca inhibitors can serve as useful
therapeutic agents for treating numerous diseases,
including glaucoma, cancer, and obesity [2 – 4].
topiramate (tpm; 1) and  xxxd3564xxx  (zns; 2) are
widely marketed antiepileptic drugs that evince some
ca inhibitory actions. although these drugs have
relatively little structural similarity, they do possess
analogous sulfamate and sulfonamide moieties,
respectively. additionally, these drugs share several
pharmacological properties in that they inhibit some
types of neuronal voltage-gated naþ and ca2 þ
channels [5], and certain isoforms of ca[2]. when
their ca inhibitory activity was first identified in the
1980’s, these compounds were viewed as comparatively weak inhibitors (e.g., relative to acetazolamide),

with ki values for zns in the range of 4 –12 mm[6 – 8]
and ki values for tpm in the range of 1– 120 mm[9 –
11] (for ca activity in erythrocytes, brain, or kidney;
in various species). as knowledge about the various
ca isozymes developed, and as ca isozymes became
available in purified forms, it has become possible to
establish more accurate ki values for each ca
isozyme[1 –4].
recently, we have conducted studies involving four
distinct assay procedures to determine ki or kd values
for the interaction of tpm with human  xxxg293xxx  and
 xxxg287xxx [12– 15]. the ki or kd values from the four
procedures consistently ranged from 0.3 – 0.6 mm for
 xxxg293xxx  and 90 – 140 mm for  xxxg287xxx . in contrast, another
research group has reported much more potent
inhibition of human  xxxg293xxx  and  xxxg287xxx  by tpm, with
ki values of 0.005 – 0.010 mm and 0.25 mm, respectively[16,17]. this apparent discrepancy in ki values of
approximately 60-fold ( xxxg293xxx ) and 400-fold ( xxxg287xxx )
provided an impetus for us to seek independent

verification through a direct thermodynamic method
(thermofluorw), which afforded a kd value of
0.3 mm for tpm[14]. since the marked differences
in ki (or kd) values between the two research groups
have yet to be adequately resolved, we became
intrigued by the possibility that slow-tight binding
kinetics might play a role. indeed, a recent publication
reports slow-tight binding behavior for zns with  xxxg293xxx [18]. according to de simone et al.[18], establishing a true ki for zns as an inhibitor of  xxxg293xxx  requires
one-hour preincubation of zns with  xxxg293xxx  prior to
initiation of the catalytic reaction. more specifically,
preincubation of zns for 15 minutes with  xxxg293xxx 
yielded a ki of 10.3 mm; however, preincubation for
60 minutes yielded a much more potent ki of
, 35 nm[18]. we have performed experiments to
replicate these findings with zns, as well as to
determine if the ki values for tpm and its sulfamide
cognate (3; jnj-17065984) would require such an
extended preincubation period. in contradistinction,
we found that preincubation of up to one hour had
essentially no effect on the ki value for zns with
either  xxxg293xxx  or  xxxg287xxx . the same behavior was
observed for tpm and sulfamide 3. additionally,
the present study confirms our prior observations that
sulfamide 3 is an exceedingly weak inhibitor of  xxxg293xxx 
and  xxxg287xxx [13 – 15].
materials and methods
test compounds
topiramate (1) and its sulfamide cognate 3 were
synthesized as described earlier[13].  xxxd3564xxx  (2)
and 4-nitrophenylacetate (4-npa) were purchased
from sigma chemical co. (st. louis, mo). test
compounds were dissolved in dmso at 100 mm and
diluted in purified water just prior to the kinetics
measurements.

incubation (inc) time after initiation of the enzymatic reaction
(4-npa hydrolysis assay). the increase in the optical density was
monitored at 1-minute intervals. the data derive from one
experiment performed in quadruplicate.

4-npa was dissolved in dmso, then diluted 10-fold
with  xxxd102xxx . the concentration of 4-npa in
the reaction medium was 3 mm. the reaction was
performed at 21– 238c in a 96-well plate. the reaction
was initiated by adding 4-npa stock solution either
within a few minutes, or at 60 min, after addition of the
enzyme. in each experiment, test compounds were
evaluated in quadruplicate. immediately after initiating
the reaction, the plate was placed in a spectramax
384 spectrophotometer (molecular devices, sunnyvale, ca) and the formation of reaction product was
monitored at 1-min intervals for 15 –20 min at 400 nm.
the concentration of 4-npa was at least 25-fold lower
than the km of 4-npa as a  xxxg293xxx  substrate[19,20].
according to the cheng –prusoff equation[21], under
these conditions the ic50 and ki values differ by less
than 3%, and they are regarded as virtually synonymous
in this study.

data analysis and calculation of ki values
enzyme reactions
in most of the experiments we used 4-nitrophenylacetate (4-npa) as the substrate for enzyme catalysis
(figures 1 –4). 4-npa (colorless) is hydrolyzed to
 xxxd2821xxx  (yellow) and acetate, and the reaction
is monitored by the emergence of color[19,20].
a detailed description of the assays used in this study
was reported previously[12,15]. the incubation
medium was buffered with hepes (10 mm) and the
ph was adjusted to 7.3 with tris. for each sample, the
reaction volume included 70 ml of the hepes –tris
solution, 10 ml of an aqueous solution of test
compound (10 ml of h2o for catalyzed control
sample), 10 ml of a freshly prepared aqueous solution
of purified human erythrocyte  xxxg293xxx  (, 0.02 to 0.1 mg)
or  xxxg287xxx  (, 0.1 to 0.5 mg) (10 ml of h2o for uncatalyzed
reaction samples), and 10 ml of a solution in which

the relative difference in the spectrophotometric
optical density between the uninhibited ca-catalyzed
reaction and the uncatalyzed reaction (nonspecific
activity) was calculated and assigned a value of 100.
the data for each test compound were referenced to
the two sets of control data, from which the percent
inhibition of ca activity was calculated. replicates for
each experiment were averaged. each compound was
tested in two or three separate experiments at six
concentrations. from the concentration –inhibition
data, ic50 (ki) values were calculated by using
prism 4 (graphpad, san diego, ca). two curve-fit
equations were used to analyze the data. one equation
assumed single site normal competition saturation

where 100 and 0 represent the maximum and
minimum possible % inhibition (i), respectively, and
x is the inhibitor concentration) and the other allowed

a 20-minute period. the raw data from this 20-minute
experiment were used to calculate the ki values.
another set of samples was treated identically except
that there was a 60-minute delay prior to initiating the
hydrolysis of 4-npa. the concentration –inhibition
data for each of the four sets of samples modeled well
to the equation describing normal saturation for onesite competition kinetics (figure 2). the ki (95%
confidence interval, 95% ci) values from this analysis
for inhibition of  xxxg293xxx  were 2.98 (2.30 –3.85) mm for
the preincubated samples and 4.64 (4.06 – 5.30) mm
for the samples that were not preincubated
(figure 2a). the corresponding ki (95% ci) values
for the inhibition of  xxxg287xxx  were 1.86 (1.62 – 2.15) mm
and 1.53 (1.22 –1.92) mm for the preincubated and
non-preincubated samples, respectively (figure 2b).
a similar set of experiments with  xxxg293xxx  or  xxxg287xxx  was
conducted for tpm to determine the effect of
preincubation on the ki value (figure 3). the
concentration – inhibition data were subjected to a
curve-fit analysis assuming one-site competition with
normal saturation kinetics, as well as a curve-fit

results
at the outset, we conducted an experiment with zns
involving  xxxg293xxx -catalyzed 4-npa hydrolysis to ascertain the rate at which the  xxxg293xxx  inhibitory effect
approached equilibrium when there was no prior
exposure of the enzyme to zns (figure 1). our results
indicate that the binding equilibrium is achieved
within 15 minutes even in the absence of preincubation.
in subsequent experiments, we determined the
effect of 60-minute preincubation of zns with  xxxg293xxx 
or  xxxg287xxx  on the calculated ki (figure 2). for one set of
samples, the hydrolysis of 4-npa was initiated within
a few minutes after zns and the enzyme ( xxxg293xxx  or
 xxxg287xxx ) were combined in the incubation medium, after
which the samples were “read” every minute over

performed with a sigmoidal saturation equation that allows for a

analysis that used a sigmoidal dose-response with a
variable slope. from this analysis, the ki (95% ci)
values for the inhibition of  xxxg293xxx  were 0.54 (0.38 –
0.76) mm for the preincubated samples and 0.45
(0.38 – 0.53) mm for the non-preincubated samples
(figure 3a). (the ki values derived from the two
curve-fitting procedures differed by less than 1%.)
since the inhibition of  xxxg287xxx  by the preincubated set of
samples exhibited a low hill slope (0.55), we elected
to use a curve-fit analysis with a variable slope
(figure 3b). the corresponding ki (95% ci) values
for the inhibition of  xxxg287xxx  were 147 (93 – 234) and 117
(92 – 150) mm for the preincubated and nonpreincubated experiments, respectively (figure 3b).
we also examined the sulfamide cognate of tpm
(3; jnj-17065984) in this manner, since the ki values
for 3 reported by us and supuran’s group have differed
widely (as mentioned above). for 3, we have obtained
consistent ki values of 340, 456, and 650 mm in three
independent experiments, as well as a kd value of
25 mm[13 – 15]. on the other hand, supuran and
coworkers reported a ki value of 2 mm[17]. could this

discrepancy in the ki values be attributable to
differences in preincubation time? to address this
issue, we not only performed a set of experiments
similar to those performed for zns and tpm, but
also an experiment involving ca-catalyzed hydration
of co2, which is described in detail elsewhere[13,15].
the concentration –inhibition data for the 4-npa
hydrolysis assay with 3 were subjected to the two
curve-fit analyses, as described above for tpm.
the inhibition of both  xxxg293xxx  and  xxxg287xxx  exhibited
relatively low hill slopes (0.74). for this reason, the
curve-fit analysis using the variable slope was chosen
again. the ki (95% ci) values for the inhibition of
 xxxg293xxx  by 3 were 382 (315 – 464) mm for the
preincubated samples and 489 (367 – 652) mm
for the non-preincubated samples (figure 4a).
the corresponding ki (95% ci) values for the
inhibition of  xxxg287xxx  by 3 were 569 (347 – 933) and
707 (506 – 989) mm for the preincubated and nonpreincubated samples, respectively (figure 4b).
in a previous study of 3 with the co2 hydration
procedure, we found it to be a weak, partial inhibitor of
 xxxg293xxx [15]. to substantiate that observation, we now
performed experiments with expanded concentration
ranges: 0.1 mm to 10 mm for  xxxg293xxx  (figure 5a) and
10 mm to 10 mm for  xxxg287xxx  (figure 5b). with both
enzymes, the inhibitory activity at the 10 mm
concentration of 3 was far below the maximum
possible inhibition of 100%. a prism curve-fit
analysis indicated that the maximum inhibition of
 xxxg293xxx  and  xxxg287xxx  by 3 was just , 50% and , 33%,
respectively. the ic50 values obtained by curve-fit
analysis were converted to ki values by using the
cheng –prusoff equation[21]. the ki (95% ci) value
for inhibition of  xxxg293xxx  was 243 (3.3 –17800) mm, with
a low hill slope of 0.48 ^ 0.24 (sem) and maximum
% inhibition of 50 ^ 25. the exceptionally wide 95%
ci for the ki is attributable to the very shallow
concentration – inhibition curve (figure 5a), which
turned out to cause rather large standard errors.
the ki value for inhibition of  xxxg287xxx  was 48.7
(21.2 –112) mm, with a hill slope of 2.0 ^ 1.4
(sem) and a maximum % inhibition of 33 ^ 5 mm.
evidently, the co2 hydration assay has limitations for
assessing very weak inhibitors such as 3.
discussion
the results of our investigation indicate that the
interaction of zns with  xxxg293xxx  or  xxxg287xxx  reached
equilibrium within a 15-minute period. also, extending the exposure time prior to initiating the catalytic
reaction with  xxxg293xxx  or  xxxg287xxx  had little or no effect on
the ki values generated with the 4-npa hydrolysis
assay. in the same vein, extending the exposure of
tpm or sulfamide 3 with either isozyme to one hour
prior to adding 4-npa had little or no effect on the ki
values (relative to those obtained at 15 minutes).

carbonic anhydrase inhibition

figure 5. concentration – inhibition graphs depicting the
inhibitory effect of 3 on the activity of human  xxxg293xxx  and  xxxg287xxx  as
determined with a co2 hydration assay (described in detail
previously[15]), instead of the 4-npa assay. the data are the
mean (^ sem) of 2 –6 experiments (each performed in triplicate).
the curve-fit analysis of the data was performed with a sigmoidal
saturation equation that allowed for a variable slope and variable
maximum % inhibition. the ki was 2.4-fold and 4.6-fold lower than
the ic50 for  xxxg293xxx  and  xxxg287xxx , respectively.

on the basis of these results, extended preincubation
of the inhibitor with the enzyme cannot be responsible
for the disparate ki values reported by us[12 –15] and
supuran’s group[16,17]. moreover, the ki values for
the inhibition of  xxxg293xxx  by 3 of 380 mm (preincubated)
and 490 mm (non-preincubated) are consistent with
our prior observations of exceedingly weak inhibition
of  xxxg293xxx [13 –15]. in fact, we were the first to note that
sulfamides appear to be much weaker inhibitors of
 xxxg293xxx  than their sulfamate congeners[13]. later, we
substantiated this point with an independent assay
based on direct binding to  xxxg293xxx  (thermofluorw
method)[22], which yielded thermodynamicallybased kd values[14]. for 3, the thermofluor
technique afforded a kd value of 25 mm, which is
50-fold weaker than the kd value for tpm[14]. the
weaker potency of a sulfamide relative to its sulfamate
cognate may be ascribed to the former being much less
acidic, with a larger pka value by nearly 2 units[14].
this , 100-fold lower acidity for the sulfamide would
mean that it has a much lower population of the

275

anionic form required for binding to zn(ii) in the ca
active site. an alternative steric explanation for 3 being
a weaker inhibitor of  xxxg293xxx  than tpm (1) was
proposed by winum et al. from an examination of the
x-ray co-crystals of 1zca-ii and 3zca-ii[17].
the kd (thermofluor) and ki (co2 hydration
assay) values for an inhibitor compound, have
generally shown reasonable consistency (# 3-fold
difference)[14]. however, there was divergence from
this picture in the case of sulfamide 3, for which the ki
was , 25-fold higher than the kd (ki ¼ 650 mm vs.
kd ¼ 25 mm). in a subsequent study, we compared
sulfamates to sulfamides as inhibitors of  xxxg293xxx  and
 xxxg287xxx , and obtained ki values by utilizing both the
co2 hydration and 4-npa hydrolysis assays[15].
thus, we encountered very shallow concentration–
inhibition curves in the co2 hydration assay with
several sulfamides, reflecting characteristics of partial
and/or mixed inhibition. by contrast, the same
sulfamides demonstrated full inhibition in the 4-npa
hydrolysis assay. to investigate this issue further for
sulfamide 3, we expanded the concentration conditions to encompass a 100,000-fold range in the
current study (figure 5a). it was hoped that such a
broad range would establish the maximum inhibition
of  xxxg293xxx  more accurately and thereby furnish a more
accurate ki value. however, despite this expanded
concentration range, the ki value of 243 mm from the
prism curve-fit analysis had an extremely wide 95%
confidence interval of 3.3 – 17800. consequently, in
the co2 hydration assay sulfamide 3 is a very weak,
partial inhibitor of  xxxg293xxx , such that it is difficult to
establish a reasonably accurate ki value for 3.
in the various assays that have been employed to test
compounds for inhibition of ca isozymes, the
biochemical principles and experimental conditions
can vary greatly. for example, assays based on the
hydration of co2 are typically performed at lower
temperatures (0 – 58c) to minimize uncatalyzed
hydration of co2, whereas the thermofluor assay is
performed at higher temperatures (50 – 608c) to
monitor the molecular folding state of the enzyme.
the temperature differences in these two assays are
likely to have some influence on the determined
inhibitor –enzyme affinity values. the operative question is: what would be considered reasonable
differences in ki or kd values generated by different
assays performed in various laboratories? in this
respect, the following issues come into play: (1) the
intrinsic properties of the assay procedure, including
the design of the experiment (e.g., number of
concentrations and replicates for each inhibitor; the
concentration(s) of the substrate); (2) the method
used to analyze the data; and (3) normal experimental
error that is inherent for each assay procedure.
because of the numerous variables involved in
generating the raw data and the various ways of
calculating ki or kd values, differences of as much

as 3-fold would be standard and acceptable. however,
when the differences exceed 5-fold, and especially
10-fold, it becomes important to identify and understand the cause(s). our current study was performed
with this aspect in mind. first, we sought to identify
the source of the 26-fold difference between the kd
and ki values for sulfamide 3 obtained in our own
laboratories[14], as described above. second, we
sought to resolve the issue related to the 60-fold to
, 400-fold difference between our reported ki and kd
values for tpm (0.3 –0.6 mm for human  xxxg293xxx ;
90 – 150 mm for human  xxxg287xxx )[12 – 15] and the ki
values reported by supuran and coworkers (0.005 –
0.010 mm for human  xxxg293xxx ; 0.25 mm for human cai)[16,17]. in the present study, our  xxxg293xxx  ki value for
3 of 380 – 490 mm still differs by ca. 200-fold from the
 xxxg293xxx  ki value of 2 mm reported by winum et al[17].
winum et al.[17] insinuated that the ca inhibition
data produced in our published studies may be flawed
due to the presence of znþ þ chelators in the
incubation medium, without proffering any evidence,
experimental or otherwise, that there could be such
an effect. perhaps, their suggestion may be based on
the notion that dithiothreitol (dtt) is included in
some co2 hydration-based assays[23], and that
dtt at very high concentrations can bind to cabound zn, thereby attenuating the ca activity[24].
we have performed experiments without dtt in the
reaction medium, or with dtt at the concentration
recommended by cammer et al.[23], and found no
differential effects on the activity of  xxxg293xxx  or  xxxg287xxx 
(control experiments; not shown). additionally, with
or without dtt, there were no differences in the
potencies of  xxxg293xxx  or  xxxg287xxx  inhibition for tpm or the
reference inhibitor acetazolamide (control experiments; not shown). along this line, it is important
to note that edta, a well-known znþ þ chelator,
actually enhances the affinity of various sulfonamide
inhibitor ligands for  xxxg293xxx  and  xxxg287xxx ; it does not
diminish their affinity[22]. consequently, a znþ þ
chelator is highly unlikely to be responsible for the
higher ki and kd values that we have reported for
tpm[12 –15].
time and again, through several independent lines
of investigation, we have demonstrated the key points
of our claims. from the work described herein, we
firmly corroborate the ki values for  xxxd3564xxx  (2),
topiramate (1), and the sulfamide cognate of
topiramate (3; jnj-17065984). moreover, we conclude that  xxxd3564xxx , topiramate, and sulfamide 3
do not require extended preincubation to express full

activity as inhibitors of  xxxg293xxx  and  xxxg287xxx . finally, we
wish to underscore that sulfamide 3 is an exceedingly
weak inhibitor of both ca isozymes.
