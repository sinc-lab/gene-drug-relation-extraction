c-peptide is an enzymatic cleavage product that arises
from  xxxg1193xxx  during maturation. it is stored in secretary
granules and eventually released into the bloodstream in
equal molar amounts with insulin. an essential role of cpeptide in the biosynthesis of insulin is linking the a and b
chains together and making inter-chain disulfide bond formation into an intramolecular process. since chemically
cross-linked a and b chains, even if intact, can fold to give
the correct disulfide linkages of insulin, the c-peptide has
been regarded as biologically inert for a long time. however, c-peptide was recently demonstrated to have beneficial effects in type i diabetes mellitus (1). although not
specified yet, the specific binding receptor for c-peptide has
been found on many types of cell membranes (2). the cpeptide signal transduction pathway is involved in mapk
(3). it is thought that c-peptide is a biologically active peptide hormone with multiple physiological functions (4).
many proteins, including most extra-cellular proteases
and some peptide hormones, are synthesized as precursors
with additional n-terminal propeptides, which are proteolytically cleaved to form the active mature molecules (5).
the role of the propeptide in protein folding has become the

focus of many investigations since the discovery of the
dependence of subtilisin on its propeptide for proper folding
in 1987 (5). the propeptides essential for protein folding
are termed intramolecular chaperones (6). more and more
propeptide-dependent protein folding systems have been
characterized since the work of shinde and inouye (7), including many proteases, such as subtilisin (8), alp (9), and
carboxypeptidase y (10), as well as some peptide hormones
such as  xxxg1002xxx  (11) and ngf (12). an intramolecular
chaperone fulfills the criteria for a molecular chaperone
(13) in that it assists the folding of the protein to which it is
linked, but is not a component of the final mature and functionally active structure. intramolecular chaperones differ
greatly from molecular chaperones. proteins can fold spontaneously under proper conditions even in the absence of
their molecular chaperone (13). however, in the absence of
intramolecular chaperones, most proteins that rely on them
can not fold into their functionally bioactive states (5-12).
interestingly, intramolecular chaperones can function in
trans, namely, a covalent attachment is not required for
them to facilitate protein folding (14, 15). as in the case of
subtilisin, intramolecular chaperones are proven to confer
structural information for folding (8). in this respect, intramolecular chaperones are also called steric chaperones
(16).
other than as a connecting peptide, the role of c-peptide
in  xxxg1193xxx  in the folding of the  xxxd2364xxx  has
rarely been reported. varandani and nafz once showed that
the addition of c-peptide had a small, but not significant,
effect on the renaturation of scrambled insulin in the presence of protein disulfide isomerase and dtt (17). several
years ago we reported that double-c-peptide human  xxxg1193xxx  has a higher refolding yield than wild type  xxxg1193xxx 
at higher protein concentrations (18). we thus hypothesizd
that  xxxg1193xxx  c-peptide may play an intramolecular

to investigate the role of c-peptide in the folding of  xxxd2364xxx , a series of c-peptide mutant  xxxg1193xxx  genes were constructed, overexpressed in escherichia coli and
the proteins purified. correct disulfide linkages of these proteins were confirmed by
both tryptic peptide mapping and  xxxg1194xxx  binding analyses. in vitro refolding
experiments were performed with the purified proteins and showed that mutations on
the glycine-rich middle segment of c-peptide, gggpgag, and deletion of the c-terminal
pentapeptide, egslq, as well as mutations on the two pairs of dibasic residues at the
two ends of c-peptide did not significantly affect the refolding yields. however, both alanine replacement mutation and deletion of three highly conserved acidic residues
(eaed) at the n-terminus of the c-peptide resulted in serious aggregation during refolding. the results indicate that the highly conserved acidic n-terminal part of c-peptide is
very important for  xxxd2364xxx  folding, and that c-peptide may have some
intramolecular chaperone-like function in the folding of  xxxd2364xxx .

materials and methods
materials—temperature-inducible
expression vector
pbv220 was used to express target proteins in escherichia
coli strain dh5a. plasmid pjg103 (derived from pbv220)
contains the gene encoding wild type human  xxxg1193xxx .
taq dna polymerase and restriction endonucleases were
purchased from promega. dtt was from serva. trypsin
with an activity of 10,400 units/mg was purchased from
sigma. 125i-insulin was kindly provided by the navy radioimmunoassay technique center (beijing, china). other
chemicals of analytical grade were local products.
construction and cloning of recombinant plasmids—
the c-peptide mutant  xxxg1193xxx  genes were obtained by
site-directed mutagenesis by pcr using pjg103 as a template. in total, nine c-peptide mutant  xxxg1193xxx  genes
were constructed, i.e. (numbering of amino acids of c-peptide according to fig. 1), 1-2a (r1, r 2 ^a), 3-6a (e3, e5,
d6->a), 15-20l (g15, g17,  xxxg19xxx , a20->l), 15-20q (g15, g17,  xxxg19xxx ,
a20->q), 15-20kq (g15, a20->k; g17, g 19 ^q), 15-20k (g15,
g17,  xxxg19xxx , a20->k), 34-35a (k34, r 35 ^a), a3-6 (deletion of
sequence eaed from 3 to 6), a29-33 (deletion of sequence
egslq from 29 to 33). expression plasmids containing the
genes encoding 15-20l, 15-20q, 15-20kq, and 15-20k
mutant proinsulins were constructed as follows. the  xxxg1193xxx  gene fragment between the ecori (b chain n-terminus) and xhol (more than half of c-peptide from its nterminus) sites in pjg103 was amplified with 5'-primer
and the corresponding 3'-mutant primer. after digestion
with ecori and xhol, the amplified fragment was cloned
into the same two sites in pjg103 to replace the native
fragment. the expression vectors for 1-2a, 3-6a, 34-35a,
a3-6, a29-33 were constructed as follows. mutant  xxxg1193xxx  genes were obtained using nested-pcr, digested with
ecori and bamhi (a chain c-terminus), and then cloned
into the .ecori and bamhi sites of pbv220. competent e.
coli strain dh5a cells were used to transform these recombinant plasmids. all mutant genes were confirmed by dna
sequencing.
expression and purification of c-peptide mutant proinsulins—the c-peptide mutant proinsulins were expressed
as inclusion bodies in e. coli. five hundred milliliters of

chaperone-like role in the folding of  xxxd2364xxx . for
this purpose, we designed a series of c-peptide mutant proinsulins according to the sequences of c-peptide (fig. 1),
and compared their in vitro refolding with that of wild type
 xxxg1193xxx .

tured at 30°c for 2 h. after a 6-h induction at 42°c, the cells
were harvested by centrifugation. the cell pellet was then
suspended in 4 volumes of stet buffer containing 0.1 m
nacl, 10 mm tris-hcl, 1 mm edta, 5% triton x-100, ph
8.0, and ultrasonicated. inclusion bodies were collected by
centrifugation  xxxd1891xxx ,000 xg at 4°c for 15 min, dissolved in
1.5 volumes of buffer containing 0.2 m nacl, 0.1 m trishcl, 1 mm edta, 8 m urea, 1 mm dtt, ph 8.0, and
stirred overnight at 4°c. after centrifugation  xxxd1891xxx ,000 xg
at 4°c for 15 min, dtt was added to the supernatant to a
final concentration of 20 mm, and the solution was incubated at 37°c for 2 h. after reduction, the solution was
diluted with 5 volumes of ice-cold distilled water. the reduced target protein was precipitated at the isoelectric
point and collected by centrifugation  xxxd1891xxx ,000 xg at 4°c for
10 min. the protein precipitate was suspended in water
and solubilized by adding 2 n naoh. the solubilized protein solution was then diluted with 0.05 m glycine-naoh
buffer, ph 10.8, to an absorption at 280 nm of about 1.0,
and kept at 4°c for 24 h. the refolded protein was concentrated by ultrafiltration and purified by sephadex g-50 gel
filtration chromatography (column 150 cm x 1.8 cm). the
target fraction was pooled and loaded onto resource™ rpc
(amersham pharmacia biotech, 3 ml) for further purification. the rpc column was equilibrated with distilled water
containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (tfa), and eluted with
a linear gradient of 0-100% acetonitrile at 1.5 ml/min over
20 min. the purified proteins were then lyophilized and
stored at -20°c. the yields of c-peptide mutant proinsulins
were in a range of 10-40 mg from 5 liters of cell culture.
in vitro refolding assay—the purified proteins were dissolved in buffer (to a protein concentration of 0.3,0.6, or 0.9
mg/ml) consisting of 0.2 m nacl, 0.1 m tris-hcl, 1 mm
edta, 8 m urea, ph 8.0, and dtt at a ratio of 80:1 (molar
amount of dtt to that of protein sh). the mixture was
incubated at 37°c for 2 h to allow complete reduction of the
protein. then, the mixture was dialyzed against 2,000 volumes of buffer containing 0.05 m glycine-naoh, ph 10.8,
for 24 h for protein refolding. the dialyzing buffer was
changed twice at 4 h intervals during the early stages of
the refolding process. the refolded sample was examined in
15% native page and the refolding yield was measured by
computational analysis of the page gel with glyko bandscan software (glyko, usa). non-reducing (no reducing
reagents in the sample loading buffer, other than the protein markers) sds-page was also used to analyze the
refolded protein samples.
tryptic peptide mapping assay—c-peptide mutant proinsulins were digested with trypsin to test their abilities to
form insulin-like molecules. the purified protein was dissolved in 0.05 m tris-hcl, ph 7.2, to a protein concentration about 2.0 mg/ml. trypsin was added to the protein
solution at a substrate/enzyme ratio of 50:1 (w/w), and the
mixture was incubated at 37°c for 30 min. the reaction
was stopped by the addition of an equal volume of 2x native
page loading buffer. the tryptic peptides were then analyzed immediately by 15% native page.
 xxxg1194xxx  binding assay—c-peptide mutant proinsulins were tested for their ability to compete with 125iinsulin in binding to  xxxg1194xxx .  xxxg1194xxx  was
partially isolated as crude membranes from human placenta according to the method previously described by fujita-yamaguchi et al. (19). the  xxxg1193xxx  proteins were

the c-peptide mutant proinsulins were compared.

preparation of c-peptide mutant proinsulins—the wild
type  xxxg1193xxx  and its nine mutant proteins were prepared
in a similar way. the expressed proteins were in the inclusion body form, and a refolding process was included in our
purification procedure. the refolded proteins were further
purified by two steps of column chromatography. the purity
of the proteins was acceptable for our investigation as
shown by native page analysis (fig. 2a). protein identity
was confirmed by both mass spectroscopy and amino acid
composition analyses (data not shown).
comparison of the in vitro refolding of c-peptide mutant
proinsulins—as shown by the native page gel in fig. 2b
and the plot in fig. 3, no significant differences were observed among the refolding products of the wild type, 1520l, 15-20q, 15-20kq, 1-2a, 34-35a, and a29-33 proteins.
the refolding yields of these mutant proinsulins were in
the same error range as that of the wild type for protein
concentrations from 0.3 to 0.9 mg/ml. even at the high protein concentration of 0.9 mg/ml, the refolding yields were
about 80%. when refolded at 0.3 mg/ml, the refolding yield
of 15-20k was above 80%, but its refolding yields decreased dramatically at both 0.9 and 0.6 mg/ml. in striking
contrast to the high refolding yields of the wild type and cpeptide mutant proinsulins, the refolding yields of 3-6a
and a3-6 were much lower, especially at high protein concentrations. the refolding yield was below 18% at 0.9 and
0.6 mg/ml, and close to 50% when at the low protein concentration of 0.3 mg/ml. on both the native page gel (fig.
2b) and the non-reducing sds-page gel (fig. 2c), some
proteins are visible at the top of the separation gel in lane
15-20k, and much more in lanes 3-6a and a3-6 (indicated
by blank arrows in fig. 2b). it is obvious that these proteins
are aggregates formed during in vitro refolding since they
moved easily into the 5% stacking gel, but were retarded at
the top of the 15% separation gel, indicating a very large
molecular mass. this can also be inferred from the results
of non-reducing sds-page analysis (fig. 2c, lane 15-20k,
lane 3-6a, lane a3-6). non-reducing sds-page analysis
showed that the aggregates were large molecules crosslinked inter-molecularly by disulfide bonds.

discussion
the role of the propeptide in protein folding has been
widely studied in recent years (5-12, 14-16). although
some progresses have been made in elucidating the physiological role of the  xxxg1193xxx  c-peptide (4), the chaperonelike function of c-peptide in the folding of the  xxxd2364xxx  has rarely been reported. under appropriate conditions, insulin with full native biological activity can be obtained in reasonably good yield from either scrambled insulin or reduced insulin a and b chains (22, 23), suggesting
that the insulin a and b chains contain sufficient structural information for correct folding. since some data have
shown that the addition of c-peptide has a small effect on

a propeptide may facilitate protein folding by greatly
decreasing the energy barrier that blocks the further transformation of the folding intermediate into the native state
(25, 26). although c-peptide has been thought to lack a stable secondary structure either within the  xxxg1193xxx  molecule or in its intact form, based on structure simulation, the
n- and c-termini of c-peptide show a tendency to form an
a-helical structure (1). the n-terminus of c-peptide elicits
the characteristics of an a-helix in high concentrations of
 xxxd3432xxx  (27). it is possible that the n-terminus of
c-peptide interacts with the insulin a and b chains to staj. biochem.

confirmation of correct bisulfide. bridges of c-peptide
mutant proinsulins—except for 34-35a, all other c-peptide
mutant proinsulins could be converted to des-b30thr-insulin by trypsin digestion as judged by comparing the relative
mobilities of the tryptic products on native page gel with
that of native porcine insulin (fig. 2d). the deletion of
b30thr does not affect the relative mobility on native
page gel as compared with insulin. as with wild type  xxxg1193xxx , des-b30thr-insulin as the major tryptic product of
15-20l, 15-20q, 15-20kq, 15-20k, 3-6a, a3-6, and a29-33
suggests that those  xxxg1193xxx  mutants might have folded
correctly with native disulfide bonds. it was observed to be
a little harder to convert 1-2a to des-b30thr-insulin, probably because the disappearance of the dibasic amino acid
residues reduced the affinity of trypsin to the b29lysb30thr cutting site. still some des-b30thr-insulin can be
seen in fig. 2d. the inability of 34-35a to be converted to
des-b30thr-insulin is due to the mutation of dibasic amino
acid residues linking the insulin a chain.
the receptor binding assay indicated that most of the cpeptide mutant proinsulins were as potent as wild type
 xxxg1193xxx  in competing with 126i-insulin for binding to
 xxxg1194xxx , except 1-2a and 34-35a, whose relative
activities were only 13.8 and 7.2%, respectively, compared
with wild type  xxxg1193xxx  (table i). since insulins with incorrect disulfide bonds give almost no receptor binding activity (20, 21), this again suggests that all mutant proinsulins could fold correctly to different degrees. the reason
that 1-2a and 34-35a show lower receptor binding activity
is probably due to the disappearance of the two positive
charges close to the insulin part in both cases. interestingly,
the disappearance of three negative charges in 3-6a mutant  xxxg1193xxx  had the effect of increasing its receptor
binding activity to some extent (table i).

the renaturation of scrambled insulin (17), and double-cpeptide  xxxg1193xxx  gives a higher refolding yield than wild
type  xxxg1193xxx  at high protein concentration (18), we propose that the  xxxg1193xxx  c-peptide may play an intramolecular chaperone-like role in the folding of  xxxd2364xxx .
the amino acid sequences of c-peptides from different
species are more variable than those of the insulin a and b
chains (4), but they do have several relatively conserved
sequences, such as the n-terminal acidic region, the glycine-rich middle segment and the c-terminal highly conserved pentapeptide (fig. 1). the glycine-rich middle segment of c-peptide has been found to possess nearly the full
biological activity of intact c-peptide (1). the c-terminal
pentapeptide of c-peptide was observed to elicit the full
activity of intact c-peptide in stimulating na+/k+-atpase
(24). in order to know the possible effects of different regions in c-peptide on the folding of  xxxd2364xxx , a
series of c-peptide mutant proinsulins were prepared. the
results of the in vitro refolding experiments indicate that
hydrophobic (15-20l) and hydrophilic (15-20q, 15-20kq,
15-20k) mutations in the glycine-rich middle part do not
significantly affect the in vitro refolding of  xxxd2364xxx . replacement of the dibasic amino acids at the two ends
of c-peptide with alanine also has little effect on the refolding of  xxxd2364xxx , as does the deletion of the c-terminal peptapeptide. however, mutations in the n-terminal
highly conserved acidic region of c-peptide do have significant effects on the in vitro refolding of  xxxd2364xxx  as
compared with wild type  xxxg1193xxx . a mutation of e3, e6,
d6 to a3, a5, a6 results in the formation of large aggregates
during in vitro refolding. similar results are obtained by
deleting this eaed sequence. these results indicate that
the highly conserved acidic region in the n-terminus of cpeptide is very important for the folding of  xxxd2364xxx . one may argue that changes in the isoelectric point
may have affected in vitro refolding under the experimental
conditions in this study, and we believe that isoelectric
point changes may have some effects on refolding behavior.
in our case, however, this factor is not very important. in
fact, 15-20kq has two more positive charges than wild type
 xxxg1193xxx , but its refolding yield is as high as that of the
wild type. 15-20k has one more positive charge than 3-6a
and a3-6, but its refolding yield is much higher than those
of 3-6a and a3-6 under the same conditions (figs. 2, a, b,
and c, and 3). all mutant proinsulins except 34-35a could
be converted to native insulin-like molecules and gave similar tryptic peptide maps (fig. 2d), indicating that these mutant proinsulins have a high incidence of correctly paired
disulfide bonds. the  xxxg1194xxx  binding assay (table i)
also indicates that all mutant proinsulins folded correctly
as evidenced by their relatively high receptor binding activities.

role ofproinsulln c-peptide
bilize the folding intermediates to favor correct folding. we
conclude that the n-terminal acidic region of c-peptide is
important for the folding of  xxxd2364xxx  and that cpeptide has some intramolecular chaperone-like function.
