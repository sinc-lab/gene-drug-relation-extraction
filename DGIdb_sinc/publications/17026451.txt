chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (cinv) is associated with a significant
deterioration in quality of life. the emetogenicity of the chemotherapeutic agents, repeated
chemotherapy cycles and patient risk factors (female gender, younger age, alcohol
consumption, history of  xxxd1892xxx ) are the major risk factors for cinv. the use of
5-hydroxytryptamine (5-ht)3 receptor antagonists plus dexamethasone has significantly
improved the control of acute cinv, but delayed nausea and vomiting remains a clinical
problem. a new agent,  xxxd2834xxx , has recently been approved for the prevention of
acute cinv in patients receiving either moderately or highly emetogenic chemotherapy
and for the prevention of delayed cinv in patients receiving moderately emetogenic
chemotherapy.  xxxd2834xxx  is a  xxxg1116xxx  antagonist with a longer half-life and a
higher binding affinity than first-generation  xxxg1116xxx  antagonists. in a single dosing
study,  xxxd2834xxx  was highly effective in controlling cinv compared with a single dose of
 xxxd1924xxx  or ondansetron in patients receiving moderately emetogenic chemotherapy.
 xxxd2834xxx  in combination with dexamethasone demonstrated control of cinv in patients
receiving highly emetogenic chemotherapy.  xxxd2834xxx  appeared to be as effective in
subsequent courses of chemotherapy compared with the initial course of chemotherapy.
there were no clinically relevant differences seen among  xxxd2834xxx , ondansetron or
 xxxd1924xxx  in laboratory, electrocardiographic or vital-sign changes, and adverse reactions
reported in the clinical trials were the most common reactions reported for the 5-ht3
receptor antagonist class. recent studies using  xxxd2834xxx -based anti-emetic
combinations in moderately and highly emetogenic chemotherapy, as well as in the
clinical setting of multiple-day chemotherapy, have been reported. future studies may
consider the use of  xxxd2834xxx  with current and other new agents and in other clinical
settings, such as bone marrow transplantation and radiation therapy.

chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting
(cinv) can be a significant problem for
patients. patients consistently report that vomiting and nausea are among the most unpleasant
and distressing aspects of chemotherapy [1,2].
even one or two emetic episodes is associated
with a significant deterioration in the quality of
life, as well as physical and cognitive functioning, and may cause patients to delay or refuse
potentially curative therapy [3–6].
studies on the prevention of cinv report on
three distinct, but related, cinv periods [7]:
• acute cinv
• delayed cinv
• overall cinv
keywords: anti-emetics,
chemotherapy induced nausea
and vomiting, serotonin
receptor antagonists

acute cinv is traditionally defined as nausea and vomiting occurring within the first 24 h
after chemotherapy administration. delayed
cinv is defined as nausea and vomiting occurring 24 h after chemotherapy and lasting up to
5 days. overall cinv refers to the 120 h
period that includes the acute and the delayed

10.2217/14796694.2.5.591 © 2006 future medicine ltd issn 1479-6694

periods. although patients can experience
cinv for longer than 5 days postchemotherapy,
the majority of studies have used 120 h as the
measurement period.
the potential for cinv is influenced by the
emetogenicity of the chemotherapeutic
agents [8–10] and patient characteristics [11].
table 1 lists the emetic risk groups with representative agents, and although the emetogenicity of a chemotherapeutic agent is the primary
risk factor, coadministration of chemotherapeutic agents [8,11], in addition to repeated
cycles of chemotherapy [12], increase the potential
for cinv.
additional factors contributing to an
increased risk for cinv include being female,
young age, a history of  xxxd1892xxx , and
consumption of minimal amounts of alcohol
(less than 1.5 ounces/day) [7,8,10,11]. the presence or absence of these risk factors, as well as
the emetogenicity of the chemotherapeutic
agents being administered, determines each
patient’s risk of cinv.

serotonin receptor antagonists

the introduction of serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine [5-ht]3) receptor antagonists for the prevention of cinv, as well as postoperative and
radiotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting, has
resulted in a major improvement in supportive
care [13–15]. treatment guidelines for the prevention of cinv, recommended by a number of
international groups [16–19,101–103], suggest the use
of a  xxxg1116xxx  antagonist and dexamethasone pre-chemotherapy for the prevention of
acute cinv, and the use of dexamethasone with
or without a  xxxg1116xxx  antagonist or metoclopramide following chemotherapy for the prevention of delayed nausea and vomiting. the
guidelines [17–19,101–103] have also recommended
the addition of  xxxd203xxx  [7,12], a neurokinin-1
receptor antagonist, to a  xxxg1116xxx  antagonist and dexamethasone prechemotherapy, and to
dexamethasone postchemotherapy for patients
receiving highly emetogenic chemotherapy
(hec) or the combination of cyclophosphamide
and doxorubicin, commonly used in patients with
breast cancer receiving adjuvant chemotherapy.
the use of a combination of a  xxxg1116xxx 
antagonist, dexamethasone and  xxxd203xxx 
results in the prevention of acute emesis in
60–80% of patients receiving hec (cisplatin,
>70 mg/m2) [7,12,20–24] and 70–85% of patients
receiving moderately emetogenic (doxorubicin)
chemotherapy (mec) [7,12,25–27].
table 2 lists the  xxxg1116xxx  antagonists
currently in use. the first generation 5-ht3
receptor antagonists –  xxxd1924xxx , granisetron,
ondansetron,  xxxd3451xxx  [28], azasetron [29] and
ramosetron [30] – are equivalent in efficacy and
toxicities when used in the recommended doses,
and compete only on an economic basis [31].
592

they have not been associated with major toxicities, with the most commonly reported adverse
events being mild headaches and constipation
[14,22,31–33]. a prolongation of cardiac conduction intervals has been reported for this class of
compounds, with  xxxd1924xxx  being more extensively studied than granisetron and ondansetron, but there have been no reported significant
clinical cardiovascular adverse events [34].
the first-generation  xxxg1116xxx  antagonists have not been as effective against delayed
emesis as they are against acute cinv [35–40].
the available studies demonstrate that, with
corticosteroids alone, or combined with either
metoclopramide or a  xxxg1116xxx  antagonist
in patients receiving cisplatin, the incidence of
delayed cinv has been reduced, but remains a
significant problem [5,15]. the first-generation
 xxxg1116xxx  antagonists do not add significant efficacy to that obtained by dexamethasone
alone in the control of delayed emesis [38].
hickok and colleagues reported that the firstgeneration  xxxg1116xxx  antagonists used in
the delayed period were no more effective than
 xxxd3018xxx  in controlling nausea. a
recent meta-analysis demonstrated that there
was neither clinical evidence nor considerations
of cost-effectiveness to justify using the firstgeneration 5-ht3 antagonists beyond 24 h
after chemotherapy for the prevention of
delayed emesis [39].
the second-generation  xxxg1116xxx  antagonist  xxxd2834xxx  has been approved for clinical
use, and recent studies indicate that it has
extended efficacy in controlling delayed cinv
compared with the first-generation 5-ht3
receptor antagonists.
 xxxd2834xxx 

 xxxd2834xxx  is a new  xxxg1116xxx  antagonist
that has antiemetic activity at both central and
gastrointestinal sites. in comparison with the
older  xxxg1116xxx  antagonists, it has a higher
binding affinity to the 5-ht3 receptors, a higher
potency, a significantly longer half-life (∼40 h,
4–5-times longer than that of  xxxd1924xxx , granisetron, or ondansetron), and an excellent safety
profile, as demonstrated in several phase i–iii
studies [41–48].

and its structural formula is shown in figure 1. it
is freely soluble in water, soluble in propylene
glycol and slightly soluble in ethanol and 2- xxxd3026xxx .  xxxd2834xxx  injection is a sterile, clear,
colorless, nonpyrogenic and isotonic buffered
solution for intravenous administration.
pharmacology

 xxxd2834xxx  is a  xxxg1116xxx  antagonist
with a high binding affinity for this receptor
and little or no affinity for other receptors.
5-ht3 receptors are located peripherally on the
nerve terminals of the vagus and centrally in the
chemoreceptor trigger zone of the area postrema [15]. animal studies have demonstrated
that chemotherapeutic agents produce nausea
and vomiting by releasing serotonin from the
enterochromaffin cells of the small intestine,
and that the released serotonin then activates
the 5-ht3 receptors located on the vagal afferents to initiate the vomiting reflex.  xxxd2834xxx  demonstrated a  xxxg1116xxx  binding
affinity at least 30-fold greater than other
 xxxg1116xxx  antagonists (table 3) [41,42].
pharmacokinetics & metabolism

after intravenous dosing of  xxxd2834xxx  in
healthy subjects and cancer patients, an initial
decline in plasma concentration is followed by a
slow elimination from the body. mean maximum plasma concentration and area under the
concentration–time curve are generally doseproportional over the dose range of
0.3–90 µg/kg in healthy subjects and in cancer
patients [41].  xxxd2834xxx  has a volume of distribution of approximately 8.3 ± 2.5 l/kg and
62% is bound to plasma proteins.

evaluation

 xxxd2834xxx  is eliminated from the body
through renal excretion and metabolic pathways. after a single intravenous dose of 10 µg/kg
[14c]  xxxd2834xxx , approximately 80% of this
dose was recovered within 144 h in the urine,
with  xxxd2834xxx  representing approximately
40% of the administered dose. the mean terminal elimination half-life is estimated to be 40 h
(table 4) [41,42].
approximately 50% of  xxxd2834xxx  is metabolized to form two primary metabolites. each of
these metabolites has less than 1% of the 5-ht3
receptor antagonist activity of  xxxd2834xxx . the
metabolic pathways are mediated via multiple
cytochrome p450 (cyp) enzymes, including
cyp2d6 and, to a lesser extent,  xxxg590xxx  and
cyp1a2. clinical pharmacokinetic parameters
are not significantly different between poor and
extensive cyp2d6 metabolizers. in vitro studies
have indicated that  xxxd2834xxx  is not an inhibitor of cyp1a2,  xxxg582xxx , cyp2c9, cyp2d6,
 xxxg589xxx  or cyp3a4/5, nor did it induce the
activity of cyp1a2, cyp2d6 or cyp3a4/5.
the potential for clinically significant drug interactions with  xxxd2834xxx  appear to be
low [41–43].
in controlled clinical trials,  xxxd2834xxx  has
been safely administered with corticosteroids,
analgesics, anti-emetics, antispasmodics and anticholinergic agents [41,42,44–49].  xxxd2834xxx  did
not inhibit the antitumor activity of five chemotherapeutic agents (cisplatin, cyclophosphamide,
 xxxd1790xxx , doxorubicin and  xxxd2655xxx ) in
murine tumor models [43].
population pharmacokinetic analysis did not
reveal any differences between cancer patients of
65 years of age and younger patients. mild-tomoderate renal impairment does not significantly affect  xxxd2834xxx  pharmacokinetics and
hepatic impairment does not significantly affect
total body clearance of  xxxd2834xxx  compared
with healthy patients. therefore, dosage adjustment is not necessary for patients with renal or
hepatic impairment [42].

clinical efficacy
initial studies

in a dose-finding study, a single intravenous dose
of  xxxd2834xxx  (0.3–90 µg/kg) was given to
161 patients receiving cisplatin (≥70 mg/m2)
[41]. approximately 50% of the patients who
received 3 µg/kg had a complete response (cr)
(no emesis, no need for rescue) for the first 24 h
postchemotherapy, with no significant  xxxd2834xxx -related toxicities. there was no improvement in cr in patients who received greater
than 3 µg/kg, and patients did not receive corticosteroids prior to chemotherapy. this dosefinding study demonstrated that the effective
dose was greater than 0.25 mg [41].
eisenberg and colleagues reported that
592 patients receiving mec were randomized to
receive a single intravenous dose of  xxxd1924xxx 
(100 mg) or  xxxd2834xxx  (0.25 or 0.75 mg) [44].
in total, 63% of the patients who received  xxxd2834xxx  0.25 mg had a cr (no emesis, no rescue) 24 h post-chemotherapy (acute period),
compared with 53% of patients who received
 xxxd1924xxx . this is a clinically significant difference, although not statistically superior in this
trial. cr in the delayed period (24–120 h
postchemotherapy) was statistically and clinically significantly improved in patients who
received the 0.25 mg dose of  xxxd2834xxx 
(54%), compared with the patients who received
 xxxd1924xxx  (39%). the prevention of nausea (no
nausea on 9-point likert scale) was numerically

better on days 1–5 and also significantly
improved on days 2 and 3 of the delayed period,
in the patients who received  xxxd2834xxx 
0.25 mg. the randomization was stratified by
gender, previous chemotherapy exposure and use
of corticosteroids.
a similar study of 570 patients receiving mec
was randomized to receive a single intravenous
dose of  xxxd2834xxx  (0.25 or 0.75 mg) or
ondansetron (32 mg) [45]. cr (no emesis, no rescue) was significantly better in both the acute and
delayed period in the patients who received  xxxd2834xxx  0.25 mg (81 and 74%, respectively)
compared with ondansetron (68 and 55%, respectively). the prevention of nausea (<5 mm on a
visual analog scale of 0–100 mm) was significantly
better for  xxxd2834xxx  only on days 3–5 of the
delayed period. there were no significant
differences in toxicities among the patient groups.
in these two large studies in patients receiving mec [44,45], cr (no emesis, no rescue) was
improved in the acute and the delayed period
for the patients who received  xxxd2834xxx 
0.25 mg alone compared with either ondansetron alone (374 patients; acute: 81.0 vs 68.6%,
p = 0.008; delayed: 74.1 vs 55.1%, p < 0.001)
[45] or  xxxd1924xxx  alone (380 patients; acute:
63.0% vs 52.9%, p = 0.049; delayed: 54.0% vs
38.7%, p = 0.004) [44]. dexamethasone was
given with the  xxxg1116xxx  antagonists in
only a small number of patients (5%) in only
one of these studies [44], and it remains to be
determined if the differences in cr would persist if dexamethasone was used in a randomized
controlled trial. importantly, the analysis of the
functional living index-emesis (flie) data
from these two randomized trials demonstrated
that improved control of cinv prevented
delayed nausea and vomiting from impacting the
daily life activities of significantly more patients
receiving  xxxd2834xxx  than the comparator
drugs [46].
in another study, 667 patients receiving hec
(cisplatin, ≥60 mg/m2) received dexamethasone
and one of two doses of  xxxd2834xxx  (0.25 or
0.75 mg) or dexamethasone and ondansetron
(32 mg) pre-chemotherapy. single-dose  xxxd2834xxx  was as effective as ondansetron in preventing acute cinv, and with dexamethasone
pretreatment its effectiveness was significantly
increased over ondansetron throughout the
5-day post-chemotherapy period [47].
in an analysis of the patients in the aforementioned studies who received repeated cycles of
mec or hec, cartmell and colleagues reported
future oncol. (2006) 2(5)

 xxxd2834xxx  – drug

that the cr rates for both acute and delayed
cinv were maintained with the single intravenous doses of  xxxd2834xxx , with or without
concomitant corticosteroids.
based on the aforementioned studies,  xxxd2834xxx  was approved by the us fda in july
2003 for the prevention of acute nausea and
vomiting associated with initial and repeat
courses of mec and hec; and for the prevention of delayed nausea and vomiting associated
with initial and repeat courses of mec.
recent studies

grote and colleagues investigated the use of  xxxd2834xxx  in combination with  xxxd203xxx  [49], a
neurokinin-1 receptor antagonist [50,104], for the
prevention of cinv in patients receiving moderately to hec. the multicenter, open-label study
evaluated the safety and efficacy of a single intravenous dose of  xxxd2834xxx  0.25 mg on day 1
prior to chemotherapy in combination with three
consecutive days of oral  xxxd203xxx  (125 mg on
day 1 and 80 mg on days 2 and 3), and three consecutive days of oral dexamethasone (12 mg on
day 1 and 8 mg on days 2 and 3). a total of 58
patients were enrolled in the study, of which 80%
were women. breast cancer was the predominant
tumor type, followed by colorectal and lung
cancer, and then malignant lymphoma. 24 of the
patients received anthracycline/cyclophosphamide
combination chemotherapy.
a cr (no emesis, no rescue) was observed in
88% of patients in the first 24 h post-chemotherapy (acute), 78% on days 2–5 (delayed), and
78% on days 1–5 (overall). no nausea was
observed in 71% of patients in the acute period,
53% in the delayed period and 52% overall.
there were no significant adverse events during
the study. it was concluded that  xxxd2834xxx 
with dexamethasone and  xxxd203xxx  was a highly
effective regimen for patients at risk for cinv.
the comparative efficacy and tolerability of
 xxxd2834xxx  and ondansetron/ xxxd1924xxx  were
assessed in a retrospective analysis using pooled
data from 171 elderly patients (aged over
65 years) with cancer enrolled in two randomized, double-blind, phase iii clinical studies
comparing single intravenous doses of these antiemetic agents given prior to receipt of mec.
the cr was significantly higher in the  xxxd2834xxx  group than in the ondansetron/ xxxd1924xxx 
group in the 5 days following chemotherapy,
suggesting that  xxxd2834xxx  is safe and effective
in elderly patients with cancer receiving
emetogenic chemotherapy [51].

evaluation

hajdenberg and colleagues reported the
results of another multicenter, open-label study
evaluating the use of  xxxd2834xxx  (0.25 mg)
and dexamethasone (8 mg) prior to patients
receiving mec to hec [52]. a total of
33 patients were enrolled in the study, 61%
were women. breast cancer was the predominant tumor type, followed by colorectal and
lung cancer. carboplatin, paclitaxel, doxorubicin
and cyclophosphamide combination chemotherapy regimens were the most commonly used
in this study.
a cr (no emesis, no rescue) was observed in
84% of patients in the first 24 h post-chemotherapy (acute) in 59% of patients during days
2–5 (delayed) and days 1–5 (overall period). no
nausea was observed in 71% of patients in the
acute period, 53% in the delayed period, and
52% in the overall period. no significant adverse
events were reported in the study.
a recent phase ii trial of olanzapine and  xxxd2834xxx  for the prevention of cinv has been
reported [53]. olanzapine had been previously
shown to be a safe and effective agent for the prevention of cinv in chemotherapy-naive cancer
patients [54]. in the phase ii trial, the anti-emesis
regimen was oral olanzapine 10mg, intravenous
 xxxd2834xxx  0.25 mg and dexamethasone
(20 mg for hec and 8 mg for mec) on the day
of chemotherapy, day 1, and 10 mg/day of oral
olanzapine alone on days 2–4 after chemotherapy. a total of 40 chemotherapy-naive patients
(median age 60 years, range 38–84; 22 females;
eastern co-operative oncology group performance status [ecog ps] 0,1) consented to the
protocol and all were evaluable. the percentage
of patients with a cr (no emesis, no rescue) was
100% for the acute period (24 h post chemotherapy), 75% for the delayed period (days 2–5
postchemotherapy) and 75% for the overall
period (0–120 h) for 8 patients receiving hec
(cisplatin >70 mg/m2). cr was 97% for the
acute period, 75% for the delayed period and
72% for the overall period in 32 patients receiving mec (doxorubicin, >50 mg/m2). in the
patients receiving hec, the percentage of
patients without nausea (0, scale 0–10, md
anderson symptom inventory, tx, usa) was
100% in the acute, 50% in the delayed and 50%
in the overall periods. in patients receiving
mec, the percentage without nausea was 100%
in the acute, 78% in the delayed and 78% in the
overall periods. there were no grade 3 or 4 toxicities and no significant pain, fatigue, disturbed
sleep, memory changes, dyspnea, lack of appetite,

drowsiness, dry mouth, mood changes or restlessness experienced by the patients. cr and control
of nausea in subsequent cycles of chemotherapy
(35 patients, cycle 2; 31 patients, cycle 3;
23 patients, cycle 4) were equal to or greater than
cycle 1. the combination of olanzapine and  xxxd2834xxx  with dexamethasone given only on the
day of chemotherapy was safe and highly effective in controlling acute and delayed cinv in
patients receiving hec and mec.
brames and colleagues reported on 32 adult
men who received 5 days of cisplatin
(20 mg/m2) therapy and were treated with  xxxd2834xxx  (0.25 mg) intravenously on days 1, 3
and 5 and dexamethasone 20 mg on days 1, 2 –
8 mg orally on days 6 and 7 and 4 mg orally on
day 8 [55]. 70% of the patients had no emetic
episodes and 63% had no or minimal nausea
over the 9-day observation period. the authors
concluded that three doses of  xxxd2834xxx  and
five doses of dexamethasone over an 8-day
period effectively prevented both emesis and significant nausea in the majority of patients with
germ cell tumors receiving multiple-day cisplatin-based chemotherapy. the regimen used
appeared to be an improvement over historical
controls. this study suggests that agents that

control both acute and delayed cinv have
potential as preventative agents in patients
receiving multiple-day chemotherapy.
postmarketing surveillance

since its approval by the us fda in july 2003,
 xxxd2834xxx  has been administered to a large
number of cancer patients for the prevention of
cinv. there have been no recurring or chronic
adverse events reported. furthermore, there have
been no clinically relevant differences seen
among  xxxd2834xxx , ondansetron or  xxxd1924xxx 
in laboratory, electrocardiographic or vital sign
changes. the safety of  xxxd2834xxx  administered
in repeated cycles of mec or hec has been
demonstrated in an open-label, multinational
phase iii study [48,56].
safety & tolerability

results from the phase ii dose-ranging study and
phase iii comparative studies (table 5) in patients
receiving mec and hec were the basis for
approval of  xxxd2834xxx  by the regulatory
authorities [41,44,45,47,48]. in these studies, patients
were exposed to a wide range of  xxxd2834xxx 
doses, up to 25-times the approved  xxxd2834xxx 
dose of 0.25 mg intravenously. the adverse

0.25 mg [42,57].
there were no clinically relevant differences
seen amongst  xxxd2834xxx , ondansetron or  xxxd1924xxx  in laboratory, electrocardiographic or vitalsign changes [42]. in phase iii studies,  xxxd2834xxx  was safely administered in 192 patients with
pre-existing cardiac impairment [42].
the safety of  xxxd2834xxx  administered over
repeated cycles of mec or hec was demonstrated in an open-label, multinational phase
iii study [48] that enrolled patients who had
participated in one of three phase iii comparator trials [44,45,47].  xxxd2834xxx , at three-times

cinv in patients receiving mec and hec.
however, these agents do not appear to have significant efficacy in the prevention of delayed
cinv, and these 5-ht3 agents compete primarily
on an economic basis.
phase iii comparative studies suggest that the
use of  xxxd2834xxx  alone improves the cr rate
of acute and delayed emesis, when compared
with the use of the first-generation  xxxg1116xxx  antagonists alone in patients receiving mec.
in combination with dexamethasone,  xxxd2834xxx  is effective in controlling acute and delayed
cinv in patients receiving hec. with dexamethasone pretreatment, single-dose  xxxd2834xxx 
was as effective as ondansetron in preventing
acute cinv, and with dexamethasone pretreatment,  xxxd2834xxx ’s effectiveness was significantly increased over ondansetron throughout
the 5-day post-chemotherapy period.
the cr rates for  xxxd2834xxx  appear to be
maintained over repeated cycles of chemotherapy for patients receiving either mec or hec.
in phase ii trials involving patients receiving
mec and hec,  xxxd2834xxx  was combined
with dexamethasone and  xxxd203xxx  in one
study, with dexamethasone in another study,
and with dexamethasone and olanzapine in
another study. these combinations were safe
and highly effective in controlling cinv. the
effect of  xxxd2834xxx  on the control of acute
and delayed cinv in combination with dexamethasone in patients receiving mec and
hec and in combination with other anti-emetics will be the subject of further studies in
patients receiving emetogenic chemotherapy.
the safety and tolerability of  xxxd2834xxx  has
been well documented in multiple, large
phase iii trials. there were no clinically relevant
differences seen among  xxxd2834xxx , ondansetron, or  xxxd1924xxx  in laboratory, electrocardiographic or vital-sign changes over multiple cycles
of chemotherapy. the adverse reactions reported
were the most common reactions reported for
the  xxxg1116xxx  antagonist class.
the control of nausea in patients receiving
mec or hec remains a significant problem.
the current first-generation  xxxg1116xxx 
antagonists, while very effective in controlling
emesis in a large percentage of patients in the initial 24 h post-chemotherapy, nevertheless fail to
adequately control nausea in a significant
number of patients. the recent  xxxd2834xxx 
studies provided some marginal improvement in
the control of nausea, sometimes to a clinically
and statistically significant degree.
598

a recent phase ii study using olanzapine in
combination with  xxxd2834xxx  and dexamethasone demonstrated promise in controlling acute
and delayed nausea in patients receiving mec
and hec.
it should be noted that all four of the 5-ht3
receptor antagonists available in the usa are
approved for the prevention of acute cinv, and
 xxxd2834xxx  is the only  xxxg1116xxx  antagonist approved for the control of delayed cinv
(in patients receiving mec). the national
comprehensive cancer network anti-emetic
guidelines for the prevention of cinv [19,101],
the multinational association of supportive
care in cancer anti-emesis guidelines [18,102],
and the american society of clinical oncology
recent anti-emesis guidelines [17,103] state that, at
appropriate dosages, all of the 5-ht3 antagonists
are interchangeable without preference for any
agent. these anti-emetic guidelines have
included the available first-generation oral
 xxxg1116xxx  antagonists as optional therapy
for the prevention of delayed emesis in patients
receiving mec, but the level of evidence
supporting this practice is low [15,39,40].
clinicians and other healthcare professionals
who are involved in administering chemotherapy
should be aware that studies have strongly suggested that patients experience more acute and
delayed cinv than is perceived by
practitioners [6], and patients often do not
receive adequate prophylaxis [4,58]. in addition, it
is essential to emphasize that the current and
new agents have been used as prophylaxis for
acute and delayed cinv and have not been
studied for use in established cinv [4,15].
future perspective

oncology practitioners now have a number of
new anti-emetics for use in preventing acute and
delayed cinv. future studies will determine
how these agents are best used and what combinations of new and older agents will be the most
beneficial for patients.
some questions that have arisen concerning
 xxxd2834xxx  include: how does it differ in
mechanism of action from the current first-generation 5-ht3 agents? does the higher binding
affinity, the longer half-life, or the high potency
account for the differences seen between  xxxd2834xxx  and the first-generation 5ht3 receptor
antagonists? does  xxxd2834xxx  affect 5ht3
receptors in a different way or in a different
location than the first-generation 5ht3 receptor
antagonists, accounting for its apparent efficacy
future oncol. (2006) 2(5)

 xxxd2834xxx  – drug

in delayed cinv? what are the effects of  xxxd2834xxx  compared with the first-generation
5ht3 receptor antagonists on nausea and emesis in combination with dexamethasone,  xxxd203xxx  and/or olanzapine? future research may
better answer some of these questions.
 xxxd2834xxx  has not been adequately studied in radiotherapy-induced nausea and
vomiting, multiple-day chemotherapy, bone

evaluation

marrow transplantation or postoperative nausea and vomiting. future studies may address
whether  xxxd2834xxx  would be effective in
patients who experience nausea and vomiting
during these conditions. such studies may not
only provide additional options for the control
of acute and delayed cinv, but may also
provide new information on the mechanism
of cinv.

executive summary
mechanism of action
•  xxxd2834xxx  is a serotonin (5-ht3) receptor antagonist that has a high binding affinity for the receptor and little or no affinity for
other receptors. 5-ht3 receptors are located on the nerve terminals of the vagus periphery and centrally in the chemoreceptor
trigger zone of the area postrema.
•  xxxd2834xxx  demonstrates a  xxxg1116xxx  binding affinity at least 30-fold higher than the first-generation 5-ht3
receptor antagonists.
pharmacokinetic properties
• after intravenous dosing of  xxxd2834xxx  in healthy subjects and cancer patients, an initial decline of plasma 5-ht3 concentration
is followed by a slow elimination from the body. mean maximum plasma concentration and area under the concentration–time
curve are generally dose-proportional over the dose range of 0.3–90 µg/kg in healthy subjects and cancer patients.
•  xxxd2834xxx  has a volume distribution of approximately 8.3 ± 2.5 l/kg. approximately 62% of  xxxd2834xxx  is bound to
plasma proteins.
•  xxxd2834xxx  is eliminated by multiple routes, with approximately 50% metabolized to form two primary metabolites. these
metabolites each have less than 1% of the  xxxg1116xxx  antagonist activity of  xxxd2834xxx .
• after a single dose of  xxxd2834xxx , approximately 80% of the dose is recovered within 144 h in the urine with  xxxd2834xxx ,
representing an estimated 40% of the administered dose. mean terminal elimination half-life is approximately 40 h.
• population pharmacokinetic analysis and clinical safety and efficacy data did not reveal any differences between cancer
patients over 65 years of age and younger patients 18–64 years of age. no dose adjustment of  xxxd2834xxx  is required for
these patients.
• mild-to-moderate renal impairment does not significantly affect  xxxd2834xxx  pharmacokinetics. dose adjustment is not
necessary in patients with any degree of renal impairment.
• hepatic impairment does not significantly affect total body clearance of  xxxd2834xxx  compared with healthy subjects. dose
adjustment is not necessary in patients with any degree of hepatic impairment.
clinical efficacy
• in multiple phase ii and iii clinical trials; in a single dosing study,  xxxd2834xxx  was highly effective in controlling chemotherapyinduced nausea and vomiting (cinv) as a single dose, compared with a single dose of  xxxd1924xxx  and ondansetron.
•  xxxd2834xxx  demonstrates efficacy, both in acute and delayed cinv in patients receiving moderately emetogenic chemotherapy.
• for patients receiving highly emetogenic chemotherapy, single-dose  xxxd2834xxx  was as effective as ondansetron in preventing
acute cinv, and, with dexamethasone pretreatment its effectiveness was significantly increased over ondansetron throughout the
5-day postchemotherapy period.
• in subsequent courses of chemotherapy,  xxxd2834xxx  appeared to be as effective as the initial course of chemotherapy.
safety & tolerability
•  xxxd2834xxx  appears to be in the wide range of safety, with dosing up to 25-times the approved  xxxd2834xxx  dose of
0.25 mg intravenously.
• adverse reactions reported were the most common reactions also reported for the  xxxg1116xxx  antagonist class – headache
and constipation.
• there are no clinically relevant differences seen among  xxxd2834xxx , ondansetron or  xxxd1924xxx  in laboratory,
electrocardiographic or vital-sign changes.
• the safety of  xxxd2834xxx  administered in repeated cycles of moderately or high emetogenic chemotherapy was demonstrated
in an open-label, multinational phase iii study.

executive summary
drug interactions
•  xxxd2834xxx  is eliminated from the body through renal excretion and metabolic pathways. as demonstrated through in vitro
studies,  xxxd2834xxx  is neither an inhibitor nor an inducer of the activity of cytochrome p450 enzymes.
• the potential for clinically significant drug interactions with  xxxd2834xxx  appears to be very low.
•  xxxd2834xxx  has been safely administered with corticosteroids, analgesics, antispasmodics and anticholinergic agents.
•  xxxd2834xxx  did not inhibit the antitumor activity of the five chemotherapy agents tested (cisplatin, cyclophosphamide,
 xxxd1790xxx , doxorubicin and  xxxd2655xxx ) in murine tumor models.
dosing & administration
• the recommended adult dose of  xxxd2834xxx  is 0.25 mg administered as a single intravenous dose approximately 30 min before
the start of chemotherapy.
• repeated dosing of  xxxd2834xxx  within a 7-day interval is not recommended because the safety of more frequent dosing has not
yet been evaluated by the regulatory agencies.
•  xxxd2834xxx  is to be infused intravenously over 30 s.
•  xxxd2834xxx  is supplied in a single-use sterile, clear, colorless solution ready for intravenous injection.
