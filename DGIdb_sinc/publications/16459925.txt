phospholipid hydrolysis was increased within 5 min, and responses were sustained for at least 60 min. maximal effects were
obtained with 10 nm pth and 50 nm pdbu. dominant negative
 xxxg1772xxx  and  xxxg1773xxx  constructs inhibited the effects of pth on the
phospholipid hydrolysis. the results suggest that both pc and pe
are substrates for phospholipase d in umr-106 osteoblastic cells

phospholipase d (pld) is activated by a number of extracellular
signaling factors including growth factors, neurotransmitters,
and hormones (1,2). pld-mediated phospholipid hydrolysis
modulates membrane composition and produces second messenger molecules (3). it plays a key role in cellular signaling
processes leading to cytoskeletal organization, vesicle trafficking, and cell proliferation and differentiation. previously, we
demonstrated that  xxxg1885xxx  (pth) stimulates pc
breakdown and pld activity, as assessed by transphosphatidylation, in umr-106 osteoblastic cells (4). we have also shown that
calcium, mitogen-activated protein kinase (mapk), small g
proteins, and galpha12/galpha13 heterotrimeric g proteins are involved

in regulation of the pth-stimulated pld activity (5,6). in the
latter studies, transphosphatidylation of ethanol, a process directly mediated by pld, was used as an indicator of pld activity. comparisons between results of experiments in which either
pc hydrolysis or transphosphatidylation was assayed revealed
that the pth- or phorbol-12,13-dibutyrate (pdbu)-stimulated
effects, as measured by transphosphatidylation, were greater than
those from pc hydrolysis. these data suggested that additional
phospholipid species might be involved in the actions of pth
and pdbu. pe is another major phospholipid component of biological membranes. kiss and anderson (7) have shown that
 xxxd2925xxx  stimulates pe hydrolysis in leukemic hl-60, nih
3t3, and bhk-21 cells. nakamura et al. (8) determined that both
pc and pe are substrates for pld activity in bovine kidney.
however, in other studies,  xxxg1772xxx  and  xxxg1773xxx  showed little (9) or
no (10) activity on pe. an n-acylpe-hydrolyzing pld also has
been identified in mammalian cells (11,12). to address the question of whether ethanolamine-containing phospholipids, and
specifically pe, could be hydrolyzed in addition to pc in response to pth or pdbu in umr-106 cells, we determined the
effects of pth and pdbu on hydrolysis of pe as well as hydrolysis of pc in dual-labeled umr-106 cells.
experimental procedures
materials. umr-106 osteoblastic cells were purchased from
american type culture collection (manassas, va). pth was
from bachem (torrance, ca). pdbu was from sigma chemical co. (st. louis, mo). [methyl-3h]choline chloride was from
amersham (arlington heights, il), and [2-14c]ethan-1-ol-2amine hydrochloride was from amersham biosciences (piscataway, nj). dominant negative pld constructs were generated as previously described (13).
cells. umr-106 osteoblastic cells were cultured to confluence in dmem with 15% heat-inactivated horse serum and
100 u/ml k- xxxd2871xxx  at 37°c in a 5% co2 environment.
cells from passages 16–18 were used. for experiments, cells
were then seeded at 500,000 cells per well in sterile 6-well
plates and allowed to attach for 24 h.
pc or pe hydrolysis. to assess pc or pe hydrolysis, umr106 cells were incubated for 48 h with [methyl-3h]choline chloride (0.25 µci/ml) and [2-14c]ethanolamine hydrochloride (0.1

µci/ml). radioactivity in pc and pe reached a plateau by this
time point. after the labeling, cells were washed with dmem
and then incubated in 2 ml serum-free dmem containing 20
mm hepes buffer and 0.1% bsa in the absence or presence of
either pth or pdbu. following incubation at the indicated times
and concentrations, media were quickly removed, and radioactivity in the media was determined by dual channel scintillation
spectrometry.
to determine the specificity of the incorporation of the
choline and ethanolamine labels, 3h and 14c were determined
in both the choline and ethanolamine released into the medium.
a 20 µl aliquot of the medium was spotted on a tlc plate.
choline and ethanolamine were separated using 0.5%
nacl/ch3oh/nh4oh (50:50:5) and visualized by exposing
the plate to iodine. the plates were autoradiographed for 2 wk
at –80°c. the choline (rf = 0.14) and ethanolamine (rf = 0.5)
bands were scraped and counted by liquid scintillation.
to determine whether pe was affected by the treatments, cells
were labeled with 14c-ethanolamine, treated with pth or pdbu
for 60 min, and then scraped into ice-cold methanol. the lipids
were then extracted. the organic phase was dried under n2, reequilibrated in 100 µl chcl3/ch3oh (9:1), and 50 µl was
spotted on a tlc plate. pe (rf = 0.54) was separated using
chcl3/ch3oh/nh4oh (65:25:5) as the running solvent. samples were spiked with a pe standard (1- xxxd2832xxx -2-oleoyl-snglycero-3-phosphoethanolamine; avanti polar lipids, alabaster,
al). the pe standard was visualized with iodine and radioactivity in the band determined.
transfection. 0.5 µg each of pcdna3 (parental vector), dn
 xxxg1772xxx  or dn  xxxg1773xxx  were precomplexed with lipofectamine
plus® reagent (life technologies, rockville, md) in optimem (gibco brl, gaithersburg, md) in the absence of an-

tibiotics and serum. cells were incubated with the constructs
for 3 h at 37°c in a 5% co2 atmosphere, after which 1 ml of
opti-mem medium containing 5% fbs and 1% penicillin/
streptomycin was added to each of the culture dishes.
medium was changed after 6 h, and incubation continued
until 48 h.
transphosphatidylation. cells were labeled with [14c] xxxd2833xxx  (0.25 µci/ml) for the final 24 h of the incubation
with the constructs described above. cells were washed and
then treated with pth for 30 min in dmem containing 20 mm
hepes, 0.1% bsa, and 1%  xxxd102xxx . to terminate the
reaction, media were quickly removed, and 1 ml ice-cold
methanol was added to cells. cells were scraped into chloroform and lipids extracted using the method of folch et al. (14).
the extract containing lipids was dried under nitrogen, lipids
were re-equilibrated in 100 µl chcl3/ch3oh (9:1), of which
50 µl was spotted on a tlc plate, and a 10-µl aliquot was
used to determine total lipid radioactivity. phosphatidylethanol
(rf = 0.57) was separated from the total lipid fraction by tlc
using chcl3/ch3oh/ch3cooh (70:10:2) as the running solvent. a 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanol standard
was run concurrently. lipids were visualized by exposure to
iodine vapor. for autoradiography, tlc plates were incubated
at –70°c for 72 h. the phosphatidylethanol bands were
scraped, and radioactivity was determined by liquid scintillation counting. the 14c radioactivity recovered in phosphatidylethanol at the end of the treatments was expressed as
the percentage of total 14c lipid radioactivity.

results and discussion
to determine whether both pc and ethanolamine-containing
phospholipids were serving as substrates for pld activity stimulated by the agonists, umr-106 cells were dual-labeled with
[methyl-3h]choline chloride and [2-14c]ethanolamine hydrochloride, and phospholipid hydrolysis was assessed as described in the experimental procedures section. in an experiment designed to test this (fig. 1), media from the incubations
were chromatographed to determine whether any of the 3hcholine label appeared in the ethanolamine and, conversely,
whether any of the 14c-ethanolamine label appeared in the
choline. treating the cells with pth (10 nm) or pdbu (500
nm) increased medium 14c-ethanolamine (fig. 1a) and 3hcholine (fig. 1d). the labeling was selective, in that there was
no significant 3h label in the ethanolamine fraction (fig. 1b)
and no significant 14c label in the choline fraction (fig. 1c).
for subsequent experiments, media were not fractionated, and
14
c and 3h were used as indicators of ethanolamine-containing
phospholipids and pc hydrolysis, respectively.
to determine whether pe was hydrolyzed in response to
treatment with pth (10 nm) or pdbu (500 nm), 14cethanolamine-labeled lipids were separated by tlc as described in the experimental procedures section. treatment for
60 min with either agonist resulted in a significant decrease in
radioactive pe (fig. 2).
to confirm that the effects on lipid hydrolysis were mediated
through pld, cells were transfected with catalytically inactive
constructs of  xxxg1772xxx  or  xxxg1773xxx  that previously have been used successfully as putative dominant negatives (16–18). both  xxxg1772xxx 
and  xxxg1773xxx  constructs were used, since both isoforms are present
in the umr-106 cells (5). pcdna3 served as a control for transfection. effects of pth were then determined. initial experiments were carried out to confirm that the constructs inhibited
pth-stimulated transphosphatidylation. data from a representa-

tive experiment are shown (fig. 3a). the constructs inhibited
pth-stimulated hydrolysis of ethanolamine-containing phospholipids (fig. 3b) and pc (fig. 3c), indicating that the effects
on phospholipid hydrolysis were mediated through pld.

pe-pld hydrolysis in osteoblastic cells

in time course experiments, 10 nm pth (fig. 4a,b) and 500
nm pdbu (fig. 4c,d) elicited significant increases in 14c and
3
h radioactivity at time points as early as 5 min. responses increased progressively and were sustained for up to 60 min. in
dose-response experiments at the 30-min time point (fig. 5), effects of pth on 14c release were maximal  xxxd1891xxx  nm and remained elevated at 100 nm (fig. 5a). pth (1–100 nm) elicited
a biphasic effect on 3h release, with significant effects  xxxd1891xxx  but
not 100 nm (fig. 5b). pdbu (5–500 nm) (fig. 5c,d) elicited
dose-dependent increases, with significant stimulation of phospholipid hydrolysis obtained with 50 nm pdbu and no further
increase with 500 nm. these dose-related effects of pth and
pdbu were replicated in other experiments. the ratios of 14c to
3
h were not significantly different in control and treated groups
(fig. 5e), indicating that the treatments did not affect the relative
rates of 3h-choline and 14c-ethanolamine release.
in view of the emerging role of pld in signal transduction,
it is important to identify the phospholipid pools that can serve
as substrates. a number of investigators have reported the hydrolysis of pc by pld (19). although this pathway is well established, it is now clear that pe is also a potential source of
signaling molecules in cells stimulated with phorbol esters and
agonists (20). activation of pld in nih3t3 fibroblasts by
 xxxd2925xxx  (21), atp or gtp (22), hormones (23), and oxidative stimuli (24) had been shown to correlate with hydrolysis of pe. the present results, in particular the observation that
dominant negative alleles of  xxxg1772xxx  and  xxxg1773xxx  block agoniststimulated pe hydrolysis, suggest that pe is a direct target for
hydrolysis by pld in response to pth in umr-106 cells.
 xxxg1772xxx  had been shown previously to hydrolyze pe in vitro with
limited efficiency in comparison with pc (9); this is the first
study, however, that links  xxxg1772xxx  and  xxxg1773xxx  action in vivo with
pe hydrolysis. pe and pc are differently distributed within the
plasma membrane, with pe being more predominant in the
inner leaflet (25). this differential distribution could result in
distinct functions being mediated by pc and pe hydrolysis.
in summary, pth and pdbu stimulated pld-dependent
generation of 3h-choline and 14c-ethanolamine in umr-106
cells. effects on phospholipid hydrolysis were time- and dosedependent. the findings are likely to be relevant to pth effects
in osteoblastic cells. phospholipid hydrolysis generates the signaling molecules pa and dag, and our previous studies have
shown that both of these are increased in response to pth (26).
the current results suggest that pe, in addition to pc, may
serve as a phospholipid source of these mediators of downstream signaling in umr-106 osteoblastic cells
