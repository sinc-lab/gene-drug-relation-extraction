he introductioti
of beta-adrenergic
blocking
drugs
has provided
one of the major
pharmacotherapeutic
advances
in this
century.
the
application
of these
drugs
has been
accelerated
by the
development
of drugs
possessing
a degree
of selectivity for two
beta-adrenergic
subgroups:
 xxxg836xxx -receptors in the heart
and  xxxg837xxx   xxxg1553xxx   xxxg2356xxx -receptors
in the peripheral

and

more
controversial
has been
the introduction
of beta
blocking
drugs
with
varying
amounts
of intrinsic
sympathomimetic
activity
(partial

recently,

the
drug
has
paa.4
the
effects
are known
to be mediated
through
beta-adrenergic
stimulation
because
they
can be antagonized
by propranolol.4
the
assessment
of the paa
of beta
blockers
in
human
beings
is complicated
by the need
to study
the intact
subject.
but paa can be assessed
in clinical trials
comparing
equivalent
pharmacologic
doses
of beta
blockers
with
and without
this property.
in
such
trials,
drugs
with
paa cause
less slowing
of the
resting
heart
rate than
do drugs
without
paa,
such
as propranolol,
atenolol
or metoprolol.4’5
it is important
to note,
by contrast,
that
both
types
of beta
blockers
similarly
reduce
the increases
in heart
rate
that
occur
with
exercise
or  xxxd2401xxx .2’4
an explanation
for these
findings
is that the importance
of
the partial
agonist
effect
in a beta blocker,
relative
to
its beta
blocker
action,
is greatest
when
sympathetic
tone
is low, as it is in resting
subjects.4
during
exercise, when
sympathetic
tone
is high,
the beta
blocking effect
of the drug
predominates
over
its paa.
whether
or not paa
in a beta
blocker
offers
an
overall
advantage
or disadvantage
in therapy
of various
cardiac
diseases
remains
a matter
of controversy.1’4
some
investigators
have
revealed
that beta
blocking
drugs
with
this property
can reduce
peripheral vascular
resistance,
providing
a different
hemodynamic
profile
for the paa
drugs
than
that
seen
with
propranolol,
metoprolol
or atenolol.
most
likely
this
effect
is related
to peripheral
 xxxg837xxx   xxxg1553xxx   xxxg2356xxx -adrenergic
stimulation,
since
selective
 xxxg836xxx -partial

like epanolol
have
no apparent
activity
in lowering
blood
pressure,6
and selective
 xxxg837xxx   xxxg1553xxx   xxxg2356xxx -partial
agonists
like dilevalol
reduce
both
peripheral
vascular
resistance
and blood
pressure.7
beta blocking

cause

in
addition
to their
effect
on heart
rate,
beta
blockers
with
paa
have
been
proposed
to cause
less depression
of myocardial
function.
a mechanism
for this
phenomenon
may
be the
stimulation
of cardiac
 xxxg836xxx -receptors
and
peripheral
 xxxg837xxx   xxxg1553xxx   xxxg2356xxx -receptors
which
can lead to a reduction
in peripheral
vascular
resistance
and subsequent
improvement
in cardiac
function.15
although
this
has not been
extensively
studied
with
 xxxd2869xxx ,
preliminary
studies
have
shown
that
it results
in less depression
of exercise
performance
than
 xxxd58xxx 
or propranolol.16
however,
since
 xxxd58xxx 
also possesses
paa,
its effects
on cardiac
function
should
have
been
similar
to
 xxxd2869xxx .
clearly,
further
investigation
is needed
before
any
definitive
conclusions
can be made
regarding
the actions
of  xxxd2869xxx 
on cardiac
performance.
in addition
to its partial
agonism,
 xxxd2869xxx ’s
potential
benefits
in clinical
practice
stem
from its negligible
effects
on both
liver
and
kidney
function.
often,
hypertensive
patients
have
evidence
of renal

restricting
their
medical
regimen

 xxxd2869xxx

beta
blockers
have
long
been
shown
to be effective
agents
in reducing
both
systolic
and
diastolic
blood
pressure,
and have
been
recommended
by the
joint
national
committee
on detection,
evaluation
and treatment
of high
blood
pressure
as an initial
first-step
therapy.1#{176} their
mechanism
of action
for
reducing
blood
pressure
has
not
been
clearly
defined;
popular
theories
include
a direct
result
of
blockade
of myocardial
and peripheral
vascular
receptors,
suppression
of renin
release,
or central
effects
(mediated
by depression
of sympathetic
outflow).4
 xxxd2869xxx 
effectively
lowers
renin
activity
comparable
to propranolol.19
it is unclear,
however,
whether
its antihypertensive
effect
stems
from
the
direct
hemodynamic
actions
of beta
blockade,
mechanisms
related
to its paa,
renin-lowering
action,
or a combination
of these.
 xxxd2869xxx 
has been
studied
in numerous
placebo-controlled
trials
and
found
to reduce
elevations
in both
systolic
and diastolic
blood
pressure.
in
one
double-blind
study,
ohman
et al.2#{176}
demonstrated
 xxxd2869xxx ’s
antihypertensive
action
in subjects
with
mild
to moderate
hypertension,
in doses
titrated
from
50 to 100 mg daily.
on average,
blood
pressure
values
fell 20/10
mm hg with
 xxxd2869xxx ,
compared
to a 2/1
mm
hg fall with
placebo.
the
drug’s
action
on lowering
supine
and standing
blood
pressures
was essentially
the same,
and doses
up to
100 mg were
well tolerated.
heart
rate was similarly
reduced,
with
changes
of 14 and 15 beats/minute
in
the standing
and supine
positions,
respectively.
as
with
other
beta
blockers,
the plasma
concentration
did not correlate
with
the reduction
in blood
pressure.20
long-term
trials
with
 xxxd2869xxx ,
with
doses
from
40-80
mg administered
daily
over
1 year,
have
demonstrated
a significant
blood
pressure
lowering
effect
in mild
to moderate
hypertensive
patients
(17%
and 19% reductions
in the standing
and supine
positions
respectively).21
 xxxd2869xxx 
has
also
been
used
in combination
with
diuretics,
and
shown
to successfully
lower
blood
pressure.2224
a combination
of 40 mg  xxxd2869xxx 
and
20 mg furosemide
led to a significant
reduction
in blood
pressure
in hypertensives
who
failed
to respond
to  xxxd2869xxx 
alone.23
as expected,
weight
loss
(and
blood
pressure
reduction)
were
greater
with
the combination
than
with
either
agent
used
as monotherapy.
both
forms
of treatment
were
well
tolerated.23
used
in conjunction
with
 xxxd2966xxx  (3 mg),
 xxxd2869xxx 
(20

creases
in systolic
and diastolic
blood
pressure,
with
minor
side
effects
and
no significant
alterations
in
hematologic
or biochemical
parameters.2224
the advantage
of using
 xxxd2869xxx 
with
a diuretic
(in addition
to the dual
mechanism
of action
on lowering
blood
pressure)
is the ability
to use smaller
doses
of
both
drugs,
with
potentially
fewer
side effects.
in numerous
trials,
 xxxd2869xxx ’s
antihypertensive
action
was compared
to that
of other
beta
blockers,
including
those
lacking
intrinsic
sympathomimetic
activity.
most
have
found
 xxxd2869xxx 
to be equal
or
superior
in lowering
blood
pressure.121425
in doses
of
40 mg administered
daily
to mild
or moderate
hypertensive
patients,
 xxxd2869xxx 
was as efficacious
as
160 mg of long acting
propranolol.25
effects
on resting heart
rate
with
both
drugs
was
essentially
the
same
over
an 8-week
period.
there
was
no difference
between
 xxxd2869xxx 
and propranolol
in terms
of patient
compliance,
and
side
effects
were
minimal.
in another
trial comparing
 xxxd2869xxx 
to metoprolol
and atenolol,
there
were
no significant
differences
in blood
pressure
lowering
effects
or changes
in resting
heart
rate.14
in doses
of 40 mg administered
once
daily,
 xxxd2869xxx 
caused
equal
reductions
in resting
blood
pressure
and heart
rate as 100
mg atenolol
or 200 mg metoprolol.
lameiger
et al.12
also confirmed
the comparable
antihypertensive
action of  xxxd2869xxx 
(40 mg) and atenolol
(100
mg), as
did schoenberger
and associates26
who also observed
similar
blood
pressure
lowering
effects
comparing
 xxxd2869xxx 
(20-80
mg/daily)
to long acting
propran..
olol and diuretics.
 xxxd2869xxx 
is clearly
effective
as an antihypertensive agent,
and its long duration
of action
allows
for
simple
once
daily
administration.
like
other
beta
blockers,
 xxxd2869xxx 
may
be more
effective
when
used
with
a diuretic;
this can also allow
for a reduction
in dosage.
additionally,
 xxxd2869xxx 
appears
to
be safe in the treatment
of hypertensives
with
renal
insufficiency.
however,
in the hemodialysis-dependent
patient,
the dose
must
be adjusted
accordingly.
in general,
patient
compliance
with
 xxxd2869xxx 
in
hypertension
is excellent,
with
minimal
adverse
effects
reported.

although
 xxxd2869xxx 
has not yet been
approved
in

states
for the treatment
of angina
pectons,
its similar
mode
of action
to other
beta-adrenergic blocking
drugs
might
be expected
to provide
the same
clinical
effect
as other
approved
agents.
the proposed
mechanism
of action
for beta blockers
involves
lowering
myocardial
oxygen

through
blockade
of  xxxg836xxx -receptors,
which
mediate

cardiovascular

and

carteolol

both
heart
rate
and
myocardial
contractility.
this
physiologic
effect
has made
beta blockers
a valuable
mode
of therapy
in patients
with
stable
angina
pectons.4
there
have
not been
extensive
trials
to date
evaluating
 xxxd2869xxx ’s
efficacy
in treating
angina;
preliminary
studies
have
demonstrated
its effects
to be
similar
to those
of propranolol.1327
assessed
by both
clinical
parameters
(frequency
of  xxxd1914xxx 
episodes,
glycerol
trinitrate
consumption)
and
objective
hemodynamic
values,
 xxxd2869xxx 
(40 mg) appears
to be
equal
to propranolol
(240
mg) in decreasing
the
number
of attacks
and reducing
trinitrate
consumption.13
moreover,
both
agents
led
to beneficial
changes
in reducing
rate-pressure
product
with
pain
and
at rest.13
both
drugs
increased
the
total
amount
of work
completed
before
the onset
of chest
pain.13
there
was
no worsening
of exercise
tachycardia
with
 xxxd2869xxx 
compared
to propranolol,
consistent
with
earlier
findings
which
showed
no
contribution
of paa
during
exertion.13
in subjective
terms,
the capacity
to do more
physical
work
while
on  xxxd2869xxx 
is favorable.27
however,
further
investigation
is needed
to establish
the clinical
utility
of  xxxd2869xxx 
in the treatment
of patients
with
angina pectoris,
and its potential
use as a cardioprotective
agent
in survivors
of acute
myocardial
infarction.

pharmacokinetics
 xxxd2869xxx 
is quickly
and extensively
absorbed
following
oral ingestion;
food does
not alter
the extent
of absorption.22
for doses
of 20-50
mg, peak
plasma
concentrations
occur
about
1 hour
after
each
dose,
and concentrations
increase
proportionately
with
an
increase
in dose.28
bioavailability
is nearly
l00%,22
and appears
to be unrelated
to dose.28
its volume
of
distribution
in healthy
patients
is approximately
32-42
liters,29
and the drug
is extensively
bound
to
plasma
proteins
(>.95%).22
because
of its highly
lipophilic
composition,
only
a small
proportion
is present in free
concentration
to interact
with
beta
receptors.30
additionally,
its lipophilicity
allows
rapid
entry
into the central
nervous
system.
 xxxd2869xxx 
is rapidly
metabolized
by hydroxylation
and
glucoronidation
to 4-hydroxypenbutolol
and
4-hydroxypenbutolol
glucoronide.
4-hydroxypenbutolol
appears
to be pharmacologically
active.18
jun et a!. demonstrated
that in doses
ranging
from
25
to 100 mg, only
a fraction
of  xxxd2869xxx 
was present
in urine,
reflecting
extensive
biotransformation
of
the parent
compound.28
 xxxd2869xxx 
is excreted

however,
the concentration

therefore,
it may
be necessary
to adjust

much
has
been
said
about

wellstein
and

postulate
that
this
complex
pattern
of
clearance
accounts
for the drug’s
long
duration
of

have
attributed
 xxxd2869xxx ’s
lasting
effects
to the active
metabolite,
4-hydroxypenbutolol. although
bernard
et al. found
detectable
levels
of these
metabolites
after
30 days,
they
were
too low
to account
for any
antihypertensive
effects.18

it is recommended
that the dose

side

effects

and

precautions

the most
serious
potential
adverse
effects
of  xxxd2869xxx 
are related
to its beta
blocking
activity,
and
include
congestive
heart
failure,
sinus
bradycardia,
first
degree
heart
block,
bronchospasm,
or peripheral vascular
effects
(cold
extremities,
paresthesias).
the incidence
of most
of these
side effects
is essentially
the same
as with
other
beta
blockers.22
however,
in comparison
to propranolol,
 xxxd2869xxx 
was
shown
to cause
significantly
less bradycardia,
perhaps
due
to its paa.12
the
incidence
of other
unwanted
effects,
including
lethargy,
headache,
lightheadedness,
muscle
cramps,
vivid
dreams,
insomnia,
and
visual
disturbances,
is similar
with
 xxxd2869xxx 
in comparison
to atenolol,
metoprolol
and propranolol.12’1425
in general,
a low incidence
in
both
frequency
and
severity
of adverse
effects
has
been
noted
with
 xxxd2869xxx ,
and
the
drug
is well
tolerated.
no significant
weight
loss
is seen
with

 xxxd2869xxx 

and

caiiteolol

 xxxd2869xxx 
alone;
however,
in combination
with furosemide,
weight
loss is common.23
 xxxd2869xxx ’s
actions
on plasma
lipoprotein
and apoprotein
levels
(also postulated
to be related
to lipophilicity)
are
negligible,
and similar
to that of atenolol.32
 xxxd2869xxx  does
not appear
to affect
significantly
hematologic or biochemical
laboratory
parameters.23
the
frequency
and severity
of adverse
reactions
does not
increase
during
long-term
therapy.
because
beta blockers
can mask
symptoms
of hypoglycemia,
 xxxd2869xxx 
should
be used cautiously
in
diabetic
patients.
similarly,
in patients
with thyrotoxicosis,
 xxxd2869xxx 
should
be carefully
administered,
with close patient
monitoring.
the treatment
of  xxxd2869xxx 
overdosage
is similar
to that of other
beta blockers.

the

the
reductions
in blood

were
not different
when

were
compared.
in numerous

blood
pressures.42
it was concluded
that

safe
and
effective
in reducing
blood
pressure
in the elderly.
the
effects
of carteolol

in hypertensive
patients
have
also
been
assessed.43
unlike
beta

beta

with

have
been
reported
to increase
lv mass
despite
favorable
effects
in lowering
blood
pressure.
after
1 year
of carteolol
treatment,
patients
with
hypertension
who
had their
blood
pressure
reduced
also demonstrated
significant
regression
of their
lvh. it was concluded
that
carteolol’s
paa
did not preclude
the regression
of lvh during
hypertension
treatment.
in summary,
carteolol
is a safe and effective
antihypertensive
drug
with
a long
duration
of action
that
allows
it to be used
once
daily
as treatment.
like
other
beta
blockers,
carteolol
may
be more
effective
when
combined
with
a diuretic.
this
can
also allow
