anti- xxxg1175xxx  monoclonal antibody amt-13 increases soluble  xxxg1175xxx  levels in vivo.  a rat anti-interleukin-2 receptor ( xxxg1175xxx ) monoclonal antibody (mab), amt-13, has been shown to prolong cardiac allograft survival in mice. however, neither the mechanism of its immunosuppressive action, nor its other in vivo effects, have been studied extensively. we investigated the effect of amt-13 on serum-soluble  xxxg1175xxx  levels by a quantitative elisa technique. following administration of multiple doses of amt-13, sufficient to delay fetal pancreatic graft rejection, a rapid and lasting increase in soluble(s)  xxxg1175xxx  levels of up to 20-fold was observed. levels returned to normal by day 9 despite continued amt-13 administration. a similar though less marked increase was observed following a single injection of amt-13. irradiation with 350 rads decreased sil-2r levels, whilst rat ig-treated control mice had sil-2r levels within the normal range. in vivo administration of recombinant il-2 also increased sil-2r levels, but the effect was transient and slight. no effect on either the release of sil-2r or expression of cell surface-associated il-2 receptors was noted when splenocytes were cultured in the presence of amt-13. we speculate that the increased concentration of sil-2r in the serum of amt-13-treated mice may play a role in the immunosuppressive action of this mab.
