 xxxg1194xxx  signaling in the development of
neuronal structure and function
shu-ling chiu1, hollis t cline2*

abstract
sensory experience plays a crucial role in regulating neuronal shape and in developing synaptic contacts during
brain formation. these features are required for a neuron to receive, integrate, and transmit signals within the neuronal network so that animals can adapt to the constant changing environment.  xxxg1194xxx  signaling, which
has been extensively studied in peripheral organ systems such as liver, muscle and adipocyte, has recently been
shown to play important roles in the central nervous system. here we review the current understanding of the
underlying mechanisms that regulate structural and functional aspects of circuit development, particularly with
respect to the role of  xxxg1194xxx  signaling in synaptic function and the development of dendritic arbor morphology. the potential link between  xxxg1194xxx  signaling malfunction and neurological disorders will also be
discussed.
introduction
the human brain is made up of billions of neurons
assembled into sophisticated circuits. information
received from sensory neurons is processed by neurons
within distinct circuits to generate specific functional
outputs, including cognitive decisions and behavior.
a fascinating problem is how these huge numbers of
neurons establish precise connections to assemble complex circuits during development. the neuron, the functional unit of the brain circuit, is a highly specialized
cell composed of the cell body, the dendrite and
the axon. the structure of the dendrite determines
where and how an individual neuron can receive and
integrate information from afferent neurons, whereas
the morphology of the axon determines where processed
information is sent to efferent neurons. sites of contacts
between the axon and dendrite, or synapses, mediate
communication between neurons for proper information
flow within the neuronal circuit. we will first review the
current understanding of cellular and molecular
mechanisms underlying synapse and dendrite development, then focus on recent evidence suggesting a function for  xxxg1194xxx  signaling in circuit function
and pathological brain diseases.

synapse and dendrite development
synapse development

the number of synaptic contacts and the efficacy of
synaptic transmission in the brain are dynamic throughout development and adulthood [1-3]. these dynamics
are crucial for neurons to optimize connections in brain
circuits during development. synaptic plasticity is also
important to optimize neuronal function in adults, for
example, to adapt to our changing environment and to
allow memories to form. synapse development is a series of distinct processes, including synapse formation,
synapse maturation and synapse maintenance. the
mechanisms that regulate each of these processes are
just starting to be unraveled.
synapse formation

synapses are specialized junctions between neurons
where the presynaptic axon terminal is packed with
synaptic vesicles and vesicle release machinery and the
postsynaptic dendritic specialization contains transmembrane neurotransmitter receptors, scaffold proteins and
signaling machinery (figure 1a; see [4] for detailed
review). time-lapse imaging in both in vivo and in vitro
preparations revealed that the temporal sequence of
synapse formation is quite rapid. the first step involves
the contact between dendrites and axons, which likely
occurs by adhesive mechanisms. second, the presynaptic
specialization assembles quickly at sites of contact [5,6].
in fact, it is thought that components of the presynaptic

figure 1 schematic diagram of an excitatory synapse and the temporal sequence of synapse formation and maturation. (a) synapses
are specialized junctions between neurons composed of complex membrane and proteins. a synapse can be divided structurally into three
parts: a presynaptic axon terminal packed with synaptic vesicles (sv) and release machinery, a synaptic cleft, and a postsynaptic dendritic
counterpart filled with neurotransmitter receptors, scaffold proteins and signaling machinery. (b) synapse formation is initiated by the contact
between dendrites and axons, followed by the recruitment of presynaptic and postsynaptic specializations. increases in synapse size and synaptic
strength by accumulation of ampa receptors at synapses are characteristics of synapse maturation. ampar, a-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4isoxazole  xxxd3029xxx  receptor; camkii, calcium calmodulin dependent kinase type ii; cask, calcium calmodulin-dependent serine kinase;

specialization are present in axons before synaptogenesis
as packets of vesicle proteins and components of the
active zone proteins [7,8], finally, the postsynaptic specialization, including the proteins postsynaptic density-95
( xxxg642xxx ), and neurotransmitter receptors, including
n-methyl-d-aspartate (nmda) receptors, are thought
to arrive somewhat later during synapse formation
(figure 1b) [9]. although the assembly of synapses is a

complex process, recent work has identified several molecules that are important in different steps of synapse formation [7,10]. for example, molecules that are present in
gradients within target regions, such as ephrins, play an
important role in directing axons and dendrites to the
correct brain regions [11,12]. adhesion molecules, such
as cadherin, are thought to be important in establishing
of the initial axodendritic contacts [13,14]. some

chiu and cline neural development 2010, 5:7
http://www.neuraldevelopment.com/content/5/1/7

transsynaptic molecules, such as neuroligin and neurexin,
are crucial in bidirectional signaling and the recruitment
of both pre- and postsynaptic proteins to new synapses
[15,16]. in addition to molecular players, neuronal activity appears to be another key regulator in the formation
of nascent synapses [17-20].
synapse maturation

synapse maturation is characterized by an increase in
the morphological size and transmission strength of the
synapse, which includes changes in both the presynaptic
axon terminal and the postsynaptic dendrite. from the
presynaptic point of view, a prominent ultrastructural
feature of synaptic maturation is the increase in the
number of synaptic vesicles per terminal [21-23], which
likely contributes to the increase in probability of transmitter release in mature synapses [17]. transmission at
immature glutamatergic synapses is mainly mediated by
nmda receptors, which shift their kinetics by replacing
 xxxg965xxx -containing receptors with
nmda receptor subunit 2a-containing receptors
[24,25]. these immature synapses can be silent or have
low synaptic strength at resting membrane potentials
because of voltage-dependent magnesium blockade of
the nmda receptor. as the synapses mature, a-amino3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole  xxxd3029xxx  (ampa)
receptors are recruited to the postsynaptic membrane,
and in addition to nmda receptors, provide fully functional glutamatergic synaptic transmission [26-29]. neuronal activity reportedly induces synapse maturation by
promoting the incorporation of nmda receptor subunit
2a-containing nmda receptors into synaptic sites.
furthermore, activity recruits ampa receptors to the
postsynaptic site to activate silent synapses and increase
the strength of synaptic transmission (figure 1b)
[4,26,27].
synapse maintenance or synapse elimination

the precise connectivity required for circuit function
relies not only on the formation of new contacts but
also the maintenance of the correct synapses. in fact,
the density of synapses formed at early stages of development is far greater than the density retained at later
stages, indicating that only selective synapses are stabilized and maintained during development [30]. the
importance of synapse maintenance is well documented
at the neuromuscular junction, where each muscle fiber
is temporarily innervated by multiple motor axons but
only one input becomes stabilized while others are
eliminated [31,32]. a reduction in synapse density has
also been demonstrated in various regions of the central
nervous system (cns) [33-37], suggesting synapse elimination could be a common process for refining the
brain circuits during development. for instance, climbing fiber to purkinje cell synapses in cerebellum undergo
synapse elimination at early postnatal ages in mammals.

page 3 of 18

although the detailed mechanisms regulating synapse
elimination and maintenance remain largely unknown,
neuronal activity appears to contribute to the maintenance of correct synapses while weaker synapses are
usually eliminated [34,38,39]. additionally, molecular
players such as insulin-like growth factor (igf)-2, complement protein 1q, major histocompatibility complex
protein, protein kinase cg, metabotropic glutamate
receptor subtype 1, and  xxxg981xxx  (glur) delta
2 subunit reportedly regulate synapse maintenance or
elimination [40-45].
dendrite development

the architecture of the dendritic arbor contributes to
the precise patterning of synaptic connections required
for normal circuit function. dendritic structure not only
determines which axons are potential presynaptic partners, but also determines how the inputs are integrated.
the marriage of single cell labeling and in vivo timelapse imaging has made it possible to explore the cellular mechanisms underlying dendritic development
[19,20,46,47]. advances in microscopy, cell biology and
molecular genetic methods have paved the way for significant advances in our understanding of the mechanisms behind the molecular and activity-dependent
regulation of dendrite development.
cellular mechanisms

imaging optic tectal neurons in vivo in xenopus tadpoles
showed that dendritic arbor elaboration goes through
distinct phases (figure 2a) [19,48]. many newly differentiated neurons first undergo axonogenesis with only
little elaboration of the dendritic arbor. about one day
after evidence of morphological differentiation, neurons
go into a rapid dendritic arbor growth phase for a few
days until they enter the third phase, characterized by a
slower dendritic arbor growth rate and more stable dendritic arbors. during the rapid dendritic arbor growth
period, one might think that the growth of the dendritic
arbor can be easily achieved by continuously lengthening pre-existing dendrites and sprouting new dendritic
branches; however, time-lapse imaging at intervals of
minutes to hours reveals that dendritic growth is highly
dynamic, consisting of not only branch addition and
extension, but also retraction and loss of dendritic
branches (figure 2b) [18,49-52]. it is worth noting that
these dynamics in dendritic morphogenesis persist in
mature neurons when their overall structure is stable,
although at a slower rate [20,53-55]. therefore, it is very
likely that mechanisms that regulate dendritic dynamics
early during development may also play a role in dendritic plasticity later in life.
molecular mechanisms

mechanisms that regulate cytoskeleton architecture play
a crucial role in shaping dendritic arbors because the

figure 2 dendritic arbor growth and dynamics. (a) dendrite development can be divided into three phases: phase i, the cell differentiates
and extends an axon with little elaboration of the dendritic arbor; phase ii, the dendritic arbor grows rapidly; phase iii, the dendritic arbor grows
slowly and appears stable. reconstruction of the same tectal neuron imaged in vivo daily for 5 days is shown on top. (adapted and modified
from [19,48].) (b) dendritic growth is highly dynamic as revealed by time-lapse imaging at 2-hour intervals over a 6-hour imaging period. stable
branches, retracted branches, transient branches, and added branches are shown in gray, red, green and yellow, respectively. cell bodies are
shown in purple. (adapted from [52].)

cytoskeleton provides the fundamental support of the
dendritic structure. filopodia are thin, highly motile
actin-based protrusions and some of them are transformed into more stable microtubule-based dendritic
branches. the rho family of small gtpases, including
rac, rhoa, and cdc42, regulate the rearrangement of
cytoskeleton and participate in distinct aspects of dendrite morphogenesis [56,57]. for example, rac and
cdc42 activity promote dendritic arbor dynamics by
increasing the rate of actin polymerization, whereas
increased rhoa activity inhibits dendritic arbor growth
in xenopus tectal neurons [57]. consistently, several
guanine exchange factors that activate rac, such as
tiam1 [58] and stef [14,59,60], have been shown to
regulate neurite formation whereas rho-specific guanine
exchange factors, such as kiaa0380 [14], and rho-specific gtpase activating proteins, such as p190 rhogap
[61], which activate or inactivate rho, respectively, have
been shown to regulate neurite retraction [14,59,60]in

vitro. interestingly, there is considerable crosstalk
among these rho gtpases. rhoa activity was increased
by rac activation and cdc42 inhibition, whereas rac
was inhibited by activation of rho in xenopus tectal
neurons in vivo [62]. this tight cross-regulation of rho
gtpases seems to work together to determine the structure of the dendritic tree. what controls the activity of
rho gtpases is a key question to understand the underlying mechanisms in dendritic morphogenesis.
in the xenopus visual system visual activity promotes
dendritic arbor growth through mechanisms that require
both  xxxg981xxx  activity and rho gtpase activity in xenopus tectal neurons [63]. accordingly, the
working hypothesis is that  xxxg981xxx  activity
promotes dendritic growth by elevating rac and cdc42
activities, leading to increased branch dynamics, and
concurrently decreasing rhoa activity to relieve its inhibition on branch extension [63]. in addition to rho
gtpases, several other molecular mechanisms, including

chiu and cline neural development 2010, 5:7
http://www.neuraldevelopment.com/content/5/1/7

signaling through neurotrophins [64,65], cpg15 [66]
and calcium calmodulin dependent kinase type ii [67],
or local protein synthesis, mediated by cytoplasmic polyadenylation [47], have been shown to regulate dendritic
arbor development in an activity-dependent manner.
these data suggest that dendritic arbor growth is organized by signals from their surrounding environment.
synaptic function and dendritic development

during circuit development, the increase in synapse
number and synaptic strength occur concurrently with
the elaboration of dendritic arbors, suggesting a coordinated regulation of synaptic function and dendritic development. almost two decades ago, vaughn first proposed
the ‘synaptotrophic hypothesis’, which states that the stabilization of synapses might stabilize the dendritic
branches and thereby explain the coordinated development of synapses and dendritic arbors [68]. recent
research has provided new supporting evidence for this
hypothesis. adhesion molecules, which play important
roles in the initial assembly and stabilization of the
synapses, regulate dendritic arbor development in mammals and flies [69,70]. moreover, live imaging of synapse
formation and dendrite growth in zebrafish showed that
the presence of the synapses associated with the stabilization of terminal dendrites [71]. on the other hand, blockade of synaptic transmission or synapse maturation
reduces dendritic arbor elaboration and blocks activitydependent dendritic growth in xenopus [18,50,52,63,72].
it is interesting to note that decreasing gabaergic transmission also changes the pattern of dendritic arbor
growth and blocks visual experience-dependent structural plasticity [73]. these data suggest that synaptic contacts and synaptic transmission regulate the growth and
elaboration of complex dendritic arbors in sculpting
circuit function during development.

the  xxxg1194xxx 
the  xxxg1194xxx  is a receptor  xxxg2198xxx  well
studied with regard to its function in the regulation of
peripheral glucose metabolism. although expression of
the  xxxg1194xxx  in the brain was discovered decades
ago [74,75],  xxxg1194xxx  function in this classic
‘insulin-insensitive’ organ remains largely unknown.
recent studies in neuronal cell culture suggest that  xxxg1194xxx  signaling regulates several neuronal functions, including spine density and neurite growth
[76,77]; however, the role of  xxxg1194xxx  signaling
in controlling structure and function of cns circuit
development has not yet been widely explored in vivo.

receptor. each monomer of the  xxxg1194xxx  is composed of one a and one b subunit bridged by an intrinsic disulfide bond [78,79]. the 135-kda  xxxg220xxx  is the
extracellular ligand binding portion, whereas the 95-kda
b subunit consists of an extracellular, a single transmembrane, and an intracellular kinase domain. ligand
binding to the a subunits activates the intrinsic kinase
activity located in the b subunits and subsequently initiates a cascade of phosphorylation events that leads to
different biological functions (figure 3a) [80].
crystal structures of the unphosphorylated and phosphorylated kinase domains of the  xxxg1194xxx  have
provided detailed information on how  xxxg1194xxx 
kinase activity is initiated. the kinase domain is composed of two lobes, the amino- and carboxy-terminal
lobes, with an activation loop in between. in the unphosphorylated state, the activation loop traverses the cleft
between two lobes such that both atp binding and protein substrate-binding sites are blocked. more specifically, while residues in the beginning of the activation
loop restrict the access of atp to its binding sites on
the  xxxg1194xxx , tyrosine 1162, one of the three
phosphorylation sites in the activation loop, binds to
the active site and competes with the kinase substrates
[81]. autophosphorylation of tyrosine 1158, 1162 and
1163 in the activation loop of the kinase domain causes
rearrangement of the activation loop and reorientation
of the amino- and carboxy-terminal lobes of the kinase,
which is necessary for productive atp binding. tyrosine
1163 is the key  xxxd1075xxx  in stabilizing the conformation of this phosphorylated activation loop,
whereas tyrosine 1158 is accessible for interaction with
downstream signaling proteins [81]. the knowledge of
 xxxg1194xxx  structure not only provides valuable
understanding on how  xxxg1194xxx  signaling is
transduced but also allows functional analysis following
the generation of various mutants of the putative atp
binding site or phosphorylation sites [82-85].
unlike other receptor tyrosine kinases, most functions
of the  xxxg1194xxx  require accessory molecules
known as  xxxg1194xxx  substrates (irss) - for example
 xxxg1198xxx -4- to engage multiple downstream signaling [86,87].
two major cellular signaling pathways, phosphoinositide3 kinase (pi3k)/akt and the ras/mitogen-activated protein kinase (mapk) pathways, can be activated by the
kinase activity of  xxxg1194xxx . these cascades regulate diverse cellular processes, such as gene expression,
protein synthesis, and vesicle trafficking, which result in
the regulation of glucose, lipid and protein metabolism,
cell growth and differentiation (figure 3c) [88,89].

specifically to insulin (ins), whereas the heterodimer with the  xxxg1145xxx  binds to not only ins but also igf-1 and igf-2. (adapted and

diversity in its protein structure and function. first,
alternative splicing produces two isoforms of insulin
receptor, ira, an exon-11 lacking form, and irb, an
exon-11 containing form in a tissue-specific manner.
moreover, post-translational glycosylation contributes to
different modifications of these receptors in different
cell types or tissues [90]. furthermore, assembly of
hybrids between different isoforms and heterodimers
with homologous  xxxg1145xxx  results in further
diversity [91,92]. although different ligand binding affinity and selectivity have been reported for insulin receptors, the physiological significance of the splice variance,
post-translational modification and homo- or heterodimerization between different insulin receptors and
 xxxg1145xxx  remain largely unknown (figure 3b)
[86,93]. neurons have mainly the ira isoform with less
glycosylation compared to glial cells or peripheral tissues
[94]. the different properties of neuronal insulin

receptors might suggest different roles of insulin receptors in the cns. interestingly, ira binds insulin or
igf-2 with comparable affinity [95] and hybrids of ira
with the  xxxg1145xxx  binds igf-1, igf-2 and insulin
with similar affinity [86,93]. taken together, these data
suggest that, in addition to insulin, igf-1 and igf-2 are
potential ligands for the  xxxg1194xxx  in the brain.
the capability of neuronal insulin receptors to interact
with various ligands suggests that insulin receptors may
play versatile functions in the cns.
in contrast to other species, xenopus laevis has two
 xxxg1194xxx  genes, which we isolated from brain
cdna libraries. at the nucleotide level, these two xenopus brain insulin receptors are highly similar to each
other (93.6% identity) and are splice variants homologous to a human brain isoform of  xxxg1194xxx 
lacking exon-11 [96]. at the amino acid level, the corresponding peptides of these two xenopus insulin

chiu and cline neural development 2010, 5:7
http://www.neuraldevelopment.com/content/5/1/7

receptors, termed  xxxg1566xxx  and ir2, share overall 95% identity and 97% similarity. since only one  xxxg1194xxx 
gene has been reported in human or other vertebrates,
the two copies of  xxxg1194xxx  genes potentially
result from the tetraploid nature of the x. laevis genome
[97]. alignment of the amino acid sequence of  xxxg1566xxx , the
more abundant xenopus  xxxg1194xxx , with other
species showed that the xenopus  xxxg1194xxx  shares
overall identities of 70%, 69% and 69% with those of
human, rat and mouse, respectively (figure 4). detailed
alignments of different domains of  xxxg1194xxx 
further revealed that the kinase domain of the xenopus
 xxxg1194xxx  shares the highest identity of 87 to 88%
with that of human, rat and mouse compared to other
regions (figure 4). in addition, the potential atp binding site and phosphorylation sites on the activation loop
of the kinase domain [81] are remarkably identical to
those of human, rat and mouse, suggesting that these
amino acids may play a functional role in  xxxg1194xxx  action and thus are well conserved in evolution.
this also suggests that it is suitable to be mutated for
studying  xxxg1194xxx  function in vivo.
expression pattern of  xxxg1194xxx  in the brain

the  xxxg1194xxx  is distributed in a widespread, but
selective, pattern in the brain, including olfactory bulb,
cerebral cortex, hypothalamus, hippocampus and cerebellum as reported in rodents [74,75,90]. the expression
level of the  xxxg1194xxx  is developmentally regulated, being higher at early stages and lower in the
adult. at the cellular level, the  xxxg1194xxx  is
enriched in neurons compared to glia [74]. subcellularly,
the  xxxg1194xxx  is a component of synapses, where
it concentrates at the postsynaptic density (psd) in cultured hippocampal neurons [98]. these data together
suggest that the  xxxg1194xxx  is in the right place at
the right time to regulate the initial neuronal development by regulating synaptic function in the cns.

page 7 of 18

although the  xxxg1145xxx , which can dimerize with
the  xxxg1194xxx  and affect its ligand affinity and specificity, as mentioned previously, shows a similar distribution in the brain as the  xxxg1194xxx , it also
exhibits a distinct expression pattern compared to the
 xxxg1194xxx  when examined in detail locally [99].
for example, both receptors are highly expressed in hippocampus; however,  xxxg1194xxx  mrna is more
abundant in the ca1 region whereas  xxxg1145xxx 
mrna is greater in the ca3 region, implying that insulin/ xxxg1145xxx  signaling may play distinct roles in
subregions of the hippocampus.
function of  xxxg1194xxx  in circuit development and
plasticity

brain  xxxg1194xxx  signaling reportedly plays diverse
roles in the cns, including regulation of synaptic plasticity [100-106], dendritic outgrowth [77,107], and involvement in neuronal survival [108,109], life span [110-114],
learning and memory [115-117], and neurological disorders [118-121]. a role for  xxxg1194xxx  signaling in
synaptic function and dendritic morphogenesis, therefore, makes it a potential regulator of circuit development
and circuit function.
synaptic function

recent work suggests  xxxg1194xxx  signaling is
involved in postsynaptic neurotransmitter receptor trafficking. for excitatory receptors, insulin accelerates clathrin-dependent endocytosis of  xxxg953xxx  subunit-containing
ampa receptors and contributes to long-term depression
[100,102,122-124]. in contrast, insulin reportedly accelerates  xxxg952xxx  subunit-containing  xxxg981xxx  insertion
into the membrane in a  xxxg952xxx  subunit-dependent manner in cultured hippocampal neurons [104]. therefore,
the physiological significance of  xxxg1194xxx  signaling
in  xxxg981xxx -mediated transmission is somewhat
controversial and needs to be further studied in vivo.
moreover, insulin promotes the delivery of nmda

receptors to the cell surface by exocytosis in xenopus
oocytes expressing recombinant nmda receptor [105].
for inhibitory receptors, insulin rapidly recruits type a
 xxxd2177xxx  (gabaa) receptors to the postsynaptic membrane in cultured hippocampal neurons [106].
these data suggest that  xxxg1194xxx  signaling is capable of regulating both excitatory and inhibitory synaptic
transmission in the cns. in addition, brief incubation of
insulin results in increased protein synthesis of  xxxg642xxx , a
dendritic scaffolding protein that associates neurotransmitter receptors and cytoskeletal elements at synapses in
hippocampal slices and synaptosomes [125], also suggesting that  xxxg1194xxx  signaling can potentially regulate
structural aspects of synaptic function, synaptogenesis
and synapse maturation.
recently, our laboratory provided direct in vivo
evidence for the function of  xxxg1194xxx  signaling
in both the structure and function of brain circuit development in the visual system of live xenopus tadpoles
[84]. the retinotectal circuit of xenopus (see schematic
in figure 5), in which tectal neurons receive direct
visual input from the retinal ganglion cells in the eye
[126], is a powerful experimental system to study
both structural [47,52,63,73] and functional plasticity
[17,36,47,73,127-130]in vivo. by taking advantage of the
xenopus visual circuit as an in vivo experimental system
amenable to molecular manipulation, electrophysiology
and a variety of imaging methods, we showed that the
 xxxg1194xxx  is required for optic tectal neurons to
receive normal levels of visual input within the retinotectal circuit [84]. reduced  xxxg1194xxx  phosphorylation by ectopic expression of dominant negative
 xxxg1194xxx  (dnir), which contains a point mutation
to abolish  xxxg1194xxx  binding to atp, or decrease
 xxxg1194xxx  protein by morpholino-mediated knockdown in tectal neurons, severely decreases their glutamatergic synaptic input and reduces their responses to
natural light stimuli (figure 5). few studies have made a
direct comparison between the effects of protein knockdown and dominant negative interference with signaling.
it is interesting to note that decreasing  xxxg1194xxx 
signaling either by expression of a dominant negative
receptor or by morpholino-mediated knockdown leads
to a comparable magnitude of functional impairment in
visual system processing, suggesting that the presence of
the protein itself does not play a role in visual system
development independent of its kinase-dependent
signaling.
dendritic morphogenesis

several molecules downstream of the  xxxg1194xxx ,
including both the ras/mapk and pi3k/akt/mammalian  xxxg1478xxx  (mtor) pathways, have been
implicated in excitatory synaptic connectivity as well as
dendritic structure [131,132]. irsp53, a novel insulin

page 8 of 18

receptor substrate enriched in the brain, where it localizes to synapses as a component of the psd [98], is particularly interesting. structural analysis predicted that
irsp53 contains several protein-protein interaction
domains, including an amino-terminal f-actin bundling
domain [133,134], a central cdc42/rac interactive binding (crib) motif [135], a src homology region 3 (sh3)
domain [76,136,137], a proline rich sh3-binding domain
[136], a proline-rich ww-binding motif [136], and a
carboxy-terminal postsynaptic density-95/discs large/
zona occudens-1 (pdz) domain [76,138]. biochemical
studies showed that it directly interacts with psd scaffold proteins, shank and  xxxg642xxx  [76,137-139], small
gtpases such as rac and cdc42 [77,139-141], and actin
regulators such as wave2 and mena [140,141]. these
data together suggest a link between  xxxg1194xxx 
signaling and the structural stabilization of excitatory
synaptic contacts through the association of synaptic
scaffolding proteins and the cytoskeleton. in fact, these
ideas were further supported by the findings that overexpression of irsp53 can increase spine density in cultured hippocampal neurons [76] and induce filopodium
formation and neurite outgrowth in n1e-115 neuroblastoma cells [77,142], whereas rna interference knockdown of irsp53 protein decreases spine density and
alters spine morphogenesis [76]. another line of evidence supporting the idea that  xxxg1194xxx  plays a
role in dendritic arbor development comes from transgenic mice lacking igf-1, a potential ligand for insulin
receptor and  xxxg1145xxx  heterodimer receptors in
the brain. pyramidal neurons from the igf-1 null mice
showed significant reduction in dendritic arbor length
and complexity as well as spine density [107].
experience-dependent dendritic plasticity

activity shapes synaptic connectivity and dendritic morphogenesis in the cns, particularly in sensory regions.
interestingly, insulin is released from neurons upon
depolarization [143,144] and irsp53 translocates to
synapses in response to activity [145], suggesting that
 xxxg1194xxx  signaling may increase in an activitydependent manner. consistent with this idea, we have
shown recently that  xxxg1194xxx  signaling plays an
important role in visual experience-dependent structural
plasticity [84]. more specifically, enhanced visual stimulation normally induces tectal neurons to increase their
rate of dendritic growth by increasing branch length
extension and branch tip stabilization. in the absence of
 xxxg1194xxx  signaling, however, more branches
shorten and more branches are lost during the period of
visual stimulation.
 xxxg1194xxx  signaling and synaptic structure

as mentioned earlier, reduced  xxxg1194xxx  protein
and signaling in xenopus visual system showed that
 xxxg1194xxx  signaling is required for optic tectal

neurons to receive proper glutamatergic synaptic input
and undergo activity-dependent dendritic arbor growth.
to probe the role of  xxxg1194xxx  signaling in developmental plasticity of the glutamatergic synapse, we
examined the spontaneous  xxxg981xxx -mediated
miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents (mepsc) in
dnir-expressing neurons. we found that they have
much lower mepsc frequency but equivalent amplitude
compared to controls, indicating that either presynaptic
vesicle release probability or synapse number is reduced
in dnir-expressing neurons. because the paired-pulsed
ratio with retinal ganglion cell axon stimulation in
dnir-expressing neurons did not change, it is unlikely
that the lower mepsc frequency in dnir-expressing
neurons is due to low probability of release. to test
whether synaptic contacts onto dnir-expressing tectal
neurons were changed in dnir-expressing neurons, we

used electron microscopy to estimate synapse density on
tectal neurons. this methodology gives both definite
identification of synaptic contacts onto transfected neurons and ultrastructural information about both preand post-synaptic profiles [23]. we estimated synapse
density by measuring the number of green fluorescent
protein (gfp)-labeled synapses normalized to the total
area of gfp-labeled dendritic profiles and found that
dnir-expressing dendrites had less than half of the
synapse density of gfp-labeled neuron controls,
although no changes in other ultrastructural features or
synapse maturation were observed (figures 6a-c) [84].
these observations, according to both electrophysiological and ultrastructural data, together with decreased
dendritic plasticity in dnir-expressing neurons, suggest
that  xxxg1194xxx  signaling maintains both synaptic
contacts and the branches they sit on, which in turn

promotes dendritic branch elaboration with visual
experience.
our observations are consistent with the synaptotrophic hypothesis, which states that the formation and
maintenance of synapses promote the stabilization of
dendritic branches and that dendritic arbor growth correlates positively with the number and strength of
synapses [18]. in the optic tectum of xenopus, visual
experience increases dendritic arbor growth rate, retinotectal synaptogenesis and retinotectal synaptic strength
[17,52,63,128,146]. similarly, in zebrafish, synapses
appear to stabilize growing dendrites and promote
further dendrite branch growth in tectal neurons [71].
conversely, blocking synapse maturation by interfering
with  xxxg981xxx  trafficking into synapses reduces
dendritic arbor elaboration and completely blocks the
visual stimulation-induced increase in dendritic arbor
growth [52]. therefore, the visual stimulation-induced
increase in synapse number and strength [17] appears to
stabilize newly extended dendritic branches. the failure
of neurons with decreased  xxxg1194xxx  signaling to
increase their growth rate in response to visual stimulation could be a result of their low synapse density. one
potential mechanism by which a lower synapse density
could affect experience-dependent structural plasticity is
that these neurons do not form and maintain synapses
on newly added branches, and they are consequently
retracted. the alternative, but not mutually exclusive,
mechanism is based on the fact that, in these experiments, we transfected single tectal neurons within an
otherwise normal optic tectum. therefore, while surrounding tectal cells, which have twice the synapse density of the dnir-expressing neurons, respond to visual
stimulation normally and can increase their synapses
and promote dendritic growth, the single dnir-expressing neuron, which responds to visual inputs very
weakly, may not be able to compete with normal neighboring tectal neurons for retinal inputs. consequently,
this might lead to branch length retraction and branch
loss in the  xxxg1194xxx  signaling deficient neurons.
unexpectedly, we found that dnir-expressing neurons
can still elaborate their dendrites over a period of several days even when synapse density is low during early
development. a similar observation was reported with
manipulation of levels of the  xxxg259xxx  brain-derived
 xxxg1614xxx , which significantly changed synapse
number but not dendritic arbor morphology [147]. in
the case of  xxxg1194xxx  signaling where experiencedependent structural plasticity is decreased when
assayed over a period of 4 hours, these daily imaging
data suggest that under conditions of decreased synaptic
input, alternative mechanisms participate in dendritic
arbor growth control.

 xxxg1194xxx  signaling and neurological diseases

emergent evidence suggests an association of insulin
receptor signaling with several neurological disorders.
although the role that the  xxxg1194xxx  may play in
these disorders is still a puzzle, enhanced brain insulin
receptor signaling has been used to treat schizophrenia
patients early in the mid-20th century [148,149] and
insulin sensitizing drugs are now in clinical trials for the
treatment of alzheimer’s disease [150-152], highlighting
its importance in both neuronal developmental and
degenerative diseases.
neurodegenerative diseases

reduced mrna and protein levels have been reported
in postmortem material from patients with neurodegenerative disorders, for example alzheimer’s sisease
[118,153] and parkinson’s disease [119], implying a role
for  xxxg1194xxx  signaling in neurodegenerative diseases. among these, alzheimer’s disease is the best-studied neurodegenerative disease with respect to insulin
receptor signaling.
alzheimer’s disease, the most common brain degeneration characterized clinically by progressive decline of
memory and pathologically by loss of synapses, formation of neurofibrillary tangles and neuritic plaques, has
been extensively studied with respect to  xxxg1194xxx 
signaling.  xxxg1194xxx  signaling inhibits a key event
in the formation of neurofibrillary tangles by reducing
tau protein phosphorylation [154,155]. additionally,
 xxxg1194xxx  signaling prevents plaque formation by
modulating amyloid b (ab) release [156] and degradation [157-160].
although tangle formation and amyloid deposits are
useful diagnostic markers, synapse loss is more robustly
correlated with cognitive deficits than any other pathological lesion observable in alzheimer’s patients
[161-164]. progressive accumulation and toxicity of ab
oligomers is the leading hypothesis for etiology of alzheimer’s disease [163]. interestingly, the ab oligomer
induces glutamatergic synapse loss [165,166], which in
addition to cholinergic synapses seems to be most
severely affected in alzheimer’s disease patients
[167,168].
furthermore, increasing evidence shows that ab binds
to the  xxxg1194xxx , decreases the relative amount of
 xxxg1194xxx  in the dendritic compartment, and
causes neuronal oxidative stress and loss of spines
[153,169-171]. intracellularly, ab is reported to block
 xxxg1194xxx  signaling by reducing akt activation
and eliminating its neuroprotective benefit [172,173].
our data suggesting that  xxxg1194xxx  signaling is
required to maintain synapses are consistent with the
model that ab leads to loss of synapses by directly

chiu and cline neural development 2010, 5:7
http://www.neuraldevelopment.com/content/5/1/7

interacting with the  xxxg1194xxx  and interfering with
 xxxg1194xxx  signaling. our data further support the
idea that synapse loss resulting from reduced insulin
receptor signaling will decrease experience-dependent
structural plasticity and ultimately lead to deficits in circuit function, including information processing and integration. by contrast, reduced  xxxg1145xxx  function
also reportedly decreases ab toxicity and ameliorates
neuronal/synaptic loss in animal models of alzheimer’s
disease [174,175]. the seemingly opposite outcomes
from decreased  xxxg1194xxx  and  xxxg1145xxx  signaling implies that either they initiate different pathways
or they share the same signaling pathway but bi-directionally regulate ab toxicity and synaptic loss in alzheimer’s disease.
neuronal developmental disorders

several neuronal developmental disorders are thought to
be associated with  xxxg1194xxx  signaling malfunction. for instance, schizophrenia is a chronic neurodevelopmental disorder that affects approximately 1.1% of
the us population, and decreased  xxxg1194xxx  protein and activity and altered downstream signaling have
been reported in post-mortem schizophrenia patients
[121]. although the underlying mechanism is poorly
understood, insulin treatment of schizophrenic patients
was initiated during the 1930s and reportedly gives
effective clinical results, [148,149]. surprisingly, schizophrenia and alzheimer’s disease share some early pathological hallmarks, such as impaired synaptic connectivity
[176-178] and abnormal dendritic structure [179,180],
that eventually result in impaired circuit function and
aberrant cognitive behavior.
another example is tuberous sclerosis (tsc), a genetic
disorder resulting from mutation in one of the two
tumor suppressor genes,  xxxg2337xxx  or  xxxg2338xxx , that often give
rise to multiple neurological deficits such as epilepsy,
mental retardation and autism. interestingly, loss of
tsc function decreases synaptic transmission and alters
spine morphology through the mtor pathway, which
overlaps with  xxxg1194xxx  signaling [181]. one
potential etiology for tsc-related neuronal deficits
could be their ability to negatively regulate insulin
receptor signaling in the brain as reported in the fly and
in mammalian cell lines [182,183].
it is now recognized that molecules that regulate aging
can also affect early neuronal development. for example,
 xxxg412xxx , which plays roles in neuronal
migration in the developing cns, is also involved in the
pathology of alzheimer’s disease [184].  xxxg1194xxx 
signaling, therefore, might participate at both ends of
the story: early development as well as later neurodegenerative diseases.

page 12 of 18

perspectives
accumulating data support the idea that  xxxg1194xxx  signaling plays a prominent role in both structural
and functional aspects of circuit development. the
detailed cellular and molecular mechanisms by which
 xxxg1194xxx  signaling control synaptic function and
dendritic structure are still to be determined. besides
the role of  xxxg1194xxx  signaling in circuit formation,  xxxg1194xxx  signaling has been linked to several neurological disorders. whether failures in synaptic
function and dendritic structure caused by decreased
 xxxg1194xxx  signaling contribute to brain diseases
later in life is an important issue to address.
synapse formation or maintenance?

precise synaptic connectivity is required for normal
brain function, yet synaptic connectivity is dynamic as a
result of constant synapse formation and elimination.
therefore, the reduced synapse number seen in dnirexpressing neurons could be due to a function of insulin
receptor signaling in synapse formation or synapse
maintenance. if  xxxg1194xxx  signaling promotes
synapse formation, disrupting  xxxg1194xxx  signaling
should cause a shift in average maturity of the synapse
population because dnir expression would block new
synapse formation but not maturation of existing
synapses; however, postsynaptic ampa/nmda ratios or
presynaptic maturation indexes were not different in
dnir-expressing neurons compared to controls. furthermore, our ultrastructural observations indicate that the
synapses onto dnir-expressing neurons have similar
maturation indices as controls. finally, we find that the
fraction of silent synapses is not altered in dnir-expressing neurons compared to controls. these three pieces
of evidence suggest that  xxxg1194xxx  signaling is not
required for synapse formation and is, therefore, more
likely to regulate synapse connectivity through synapse
maintenance. collectively, these results indicate that
synapse maturation and the balance of synapse formation and elimination could be separately regulated in
vivo, and that  xxxg1194xxx  signaling has an impact
specifically on the synapse numbers by regulating
synapse elimination. moderate expression of  xxxg642xxx  has
been used as an in vivo synaptic marker without significantly affecting synaptic density in xenopus tadpoles
and other vertebrates [147,185]. therefore, it would be
interesting to perform in vivo time-lapse imaging to
monitor synapse dynamics by tracking fluorescently
tagged  xxxg642xxx  puncta in optic tectal cell dendrites.
detailed analysis of synapse behaviors - for example, to
determine numbers of added, stable and lost synapses in
dnir- or gfp-transfected neurons - would provide a
direct test of the hypothesis and could elucidate the

chiu and cline neural development 2010, 5:7
http://www.neuraldevelopment.com/content/5/1/7

cellular mechanism of  xxxg1194xxx  signaling in regulating synapse connectivity.
endogenous ligand and receptor composition

insulin is thought to be the primary ligand for the  xxxg1194xxx ; however, igf-2 also reportedly binds the
homodimer of the  xxxg1194xxx  splice variant in the
brain [95]. moreover, the discovery that the insulin
receptor and  xxxg1145xxx  heterodimerize expands the
potential ligands for  xxxg1194xxx  heterodimers in
the brain to include insulin, igf-2, igf-1 and possibly
others [86]. several potential ligands - for example,
mammalian insulin and nematode insulin and igfs have been reported to affect synaptic transmission
and plasticity, dendrite structure, whole animal
lifespan and behaviors in various model systems
[101,105-107,186-189]. the identity of the primary
ligand(s) that activate  xxxg1194xxx  signaling and regulate synapse number, where the ligands are found in
the brain and how are they regulated are all important
questions requiring further exploration.
at the receptor level, it is important to investigate the
composition of the receptor dimer since it determines
the specificity and affinity of the ligand(s) and might
initiate distinct downstream signaling pathways. our
strategy of using dnir expression can potentially disrupt
three types of receptor signaling according to the receptor composition: the  xxxg1194xxx  homodimer; the
 xxxg1194xxx - xxxg1145xxx  heterodimer; and the
 xxxg1145xxx  homodimer. it is interesting to note that
when antisense morpholino oligonucleotides were used
to specifically knockdown  xxxg1194xxx  but not
 xxxg1145xxx , morpholino-transfected neurons show a
similar deficit in visual responses recorded in vivo compared to dnir-expressing neurons. this result indicates
that the  xxxg1194xxx , instead of the  xxxg1145xxx ,
plays major roles in visual circuit function. nevertheless,
whether the  xxxg1194xxx  executes its function
through the  xxxg1194xxx  homodimer or the insulin
receptor/ xxxg1145xxx  heterodimer is still an open
question. traditional co-immunoprecipitation of
the  xxxg1194xxx  dimers from brain lysate might help
in deciphering the receptor composition if one can
develop specific antibodies to differentiate these two
structurally similar receptors. alternatively, molecular
tools - for example, morpholino or rna interference to specifically knockdown the  xxxg1194xxx , the
 xxxg1145xxx  alone, or both together may provide
further insight.
molecular mechanisms

the decrease in  xxxg1194xxx  signaling by dnir
expression affects visual responses in tectal neurons to
the same extent as morpholino-mediated knockdown of

page 13 of 18

 xxxg1194xxx  protein, indicating that kinase activity
of the  xxxg1194xxx  plays a major role in insulin
receptor function. what are the downstream cascades
activated by  xxxg1194xxx  kinase activity in the cns?
studies in peripheral tissues have demonstrated that
mapk or akt are major pathways downstream of the
 xxxg1194xxx  [88]. whether mapk or akt pathways
underlie  xxxg1194xxx -mediated circuit development
needs to be further explored. in addition to these general pathways, some molecules appear to be more specific to  xxxg1194xxx  signaling, for example, irss [190].
as mentioned before, irsp53 is a great candidate to
execute  xxxg1194xxx  function at excitatory synapses
by regulating the actin cytoskeleton through a pathway
that requires its coupling with activated rho gtpase
[77,140,141]. whether this effect on actin cytoskeleton
originates from  xxxg1194xxx  signaling would be
interesting to know. recently, the phosphorylation sites
of irsp53 that specifically respond to  xxxg1194xxx 
signaling have been discovered [191]. mutations of
these sites would allow us to understand the interplay
between the  xxxg1194xxx , irsp53 and rhogtpases
in the structural aspects of circuit development.
neurological disorders

accumulating data suggest a potential link between
 xxxg1194xxx  signaling and several neurological disorders. as mentioned above, enhanced  xxxg1194xxx 
signaling has been one strategy for clinical treatments
for patients with alzheimer’s disease [150-152] and schizophrenia [148,149], although the underlying mechanism is not clear. one common pathological hallmark for
alzheimer’s disease and schizophrenia is the problem in
circuit function as a result of reduced synaptic connectivity [176-178,192]. the discovery of a crucial role for
the  xxxg1194xxx  in synapse maintenance and circuit
function suggests a cellular mechanism to illustrate how
impaired  xxxg1194xxx  signaling may contribute to
neurological disorders. nevertheless, improved treatments and additional research are needed to understand
the detailed molecular mechanism by which the insulin
receptor affects synapse loss or function of brain circuits. a transgenic model system in which  xxxg1194xxx  levels or signaling could be controlled with spatial
and temporal resolution would be beneficial in exploring
the detailed mechanisms at the molecular level and the
pathogenesis at the behavioral level. since whole system
knockouts of  xxxg1194xxx  in mice are lethal [193],
conditional knockouts will be required. in fact, neuron
specific  xxxg1194xxx  knockout mice that are viable
have been developed and they show decreased phosphorylation of akt and  xxxg978xxx .
interestingly,  xxxg978xxx  is again
highly associated with alzheimer’s disease [155,194] and

chiu and cline neural development 2010, 5:7
http://www.neuraldevelopment.com/content/5/1/7

schizophrenia [195]. further research on this type of
transgenic system will provide insight into the physiological function of the  xxxg1194xxx  in the development
of the normal brain as well as the etiology of neurological diseases.
