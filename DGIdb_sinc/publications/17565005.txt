reduction of hent1, hent2, and  xxxg2130xxx  expression. using a
clonogenic assay, hypoxic treatment of cells made them 2- to
3-fold more susceptible to l-oddc but not to  xxxd2188xxx  after exposure to drugs for one generation. dimethyloxallyl glycine
enhanced the cytotoxicity of l-oddc but not  xxxd2188xxx  in panc-1
cells under normoxic conditions. overexpression or down-regulation of pgk using transient transfection of pcdna5-pgk or
inducible shrna in rko cells affected the cytotoxicity of loddc but not that of  xxxd2188xxx . the knockdown of hif-1␣ in

modest activity in advanced pancreatic adenocarcinoma

clinical trials for the treatment of solid tumors.
in previous studies, we demonstrated that l-oddc can be
phosphorylated by  xxxg611xxx  ( xxxg611xxx ) to its monophosphate metabolite, which is further phosphorylated to the
di- and triphosphate metabolites by cellular kinases (grove
and cheng, 1996). the triphosphate metabolite of l-oddc
can be incorporated into dna in vitro by dna polymerases ␣,
␤, ␦, ␥, and ␧ (kukhanova et al., 1995). because l-oddc lacks
a hydroxyl group at the 3⬘-position, once incorporated into
dna, it causes premature termination of dna replication
and eventually leads to cell death. therefore, the cytotoxicity
of l-oddc is dependent on the steady-state level of the incorporated l-oddc in nuclear dna. this level is affected by the
amount of l-oddctp formed by phosphoglycerate kinase

abstract
␤-l-dioxolane-cytidine (l-oddc,  xxxd3453xxx ,  xxxd3453xxx ), a
novel l-configuration  xxxd1836xxx  analog, is under clinical
trials for treating cancer. the cytotoxicity of l-oddc is dependent on the amount of the triphosphate form (l-oddctp) in
nuclear dna. phosphoglycerate kinase (pgk), a downstream
protein of hypoxia-inducible-factor-1␣ (hif-1␣), is responsible
for the phosphorylation of the diphosphate to the triphosphate
of l-oddc. in this study, we studied the impact of hypoxia on
the metabolism and the cytotoxicity of l-oddc and ␤-d-2⬘,2⬘difluorodeoxycytidine ( xxxd2188xxx ) in several human tumor cell lines
including hepg2, hep3b, a673, panc-1, and rko. hypoxic
treatment induced the protein expression of pgk 3-fold but had
no effect on the protein expression of  xxxg171xxx ,  xxxg611xxx ,  xxxg478xxx , and
 xxxg1568xxx  h1. hypoxic treatment increased l-oddctp formation
and incorporation of l-oddc into dna, but it decreased the

materials and methods
cell culture. hepg2 (human hepatocellular carcinoma), hep3b
(human hepatocellular carcinoma), panc-1 (human pancreatic carcinoma), a673 (human rhabdomyosarcoma), and rko (human colon
carcinoma) cells were grown in rpmi 1640 medium supplemented
with 10% fetal bovine serum in a 37°c humidified incubator with a
5% co2 atmosphere or in a 37°c hypoxic chamber that was perfused
with a gas mixture of 1% o2, 5% co2, and 95% n2.
western blotting. cells were lysed in 2⫻ sds sample buffer
(62.5 mm tris-hcl, 2% sds, 10% glycerol, 50 mm dithiothreitol, and
0.05% bromphenol blue) and sonicated for 10 s to shear dna. the
whole-cell extracts were then electrophoresed through 12% sdspolyacrylamide gels and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes
(bio-rad laboratories, hercules, ca) with a mini trans-blot cell
(bio-rad). the membranes were blocked and probed in 1⫻ pbs
buffer with 0.2% tween 20 containing 5% nonfat milk. monoclonal
anti-hif-1␣ (1:2000), polyclonal anti-pgk (1:5000), polyclonal antiape-1 (1:7500; santa cruz biotechnology, santa cruz, ca), polyclonal anti- xxxg1568xxx  h1 (1:1000; santa cruz biotechnology), polyclonal
anti- xxxg478xxx  (1:2000; liou et al., 2002), and polyclonal anti- xxxg611xxx  (1:
2000; hatzis et al., 1998) were used to detect the corresponding
proteins. ␤-actin was used as an internal control to ensure equal
protein loading and detected with a monoclonal actin antibody diluted 1:2500 (sigma, st. louis, mo). the membranes were then
further incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antimouse igg and anti-rabbit igg (1:5000; sigma), the immunoreactive
bands were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence reagents
(perkinelmer life and analytical sciences, waltham, ma), and densitometry scanning was performed with the densitometer (ge
healthcare, chalfont st. giles, buckinghamshire, uk).
confocal microscopy. cells with or without hypoxia pretreatment were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in pbs and then permeabilized with 0.5% triton x-100 in pbs. bovine  xxxg124xxx  (1%)
in pbs was used to block nonspecific binding. cells were then ex-

posed to monoclonal anti-hif-1␣, polyclonal anti-pgk, or monoclonal anti- xxxg171xxx  (1:3000; novus, littleton, co) at room temperature
for 1 h, followed by fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated antimouse/rabbit igg at 1:200 dilution. cytoplasmic actin was counterstained with 0.25 ␮g/ml rhodamine phalloidin (invitrogen, carlsbad,
ca). the cells were then sealed in antifade reagent (invitrogen).
confocal micrographs were scanned by a laser scanning confocal
microscope (lsm 510; carl zeiss, inc., thornwood, ny).
clonogenic assay. cells (1 ⫻ 103) were plated in six-well plates
and pretreated with or without hypoxic conditions for 24 h. cells
were treated with l-oddc or  xxxd2188xxx  for one generation followed by an
exchange with fresh culture medium. the colonies were counted
after incubating 7 days and then stained with  xxxd2610xxx . the
results include the means and s.d. obtained from three independent
experiments.
metabolism of nucleoside analogs. the cells were treated
with [3h]l-oddc at 500 nm (2 ci/mmol) for 20 h and [3h] xxxd2188xxx  at 500
nm (2 ci/mmol) for 2 h. for up-regulation of pgk, the open reading
frame of pgk was cloned into pcdna5/to vector to form pcdna5pgk. the pcdna5-pgk was transfected into rko cells (5 ␮g of
dna/106 cells) using lipofectamine 2000 (invitrogen) for 48 h before
hypoxic treatment. for down-regulation of pgk and hif-1␣, inducible shrna cell lines were established as described previously (lam
et al., 2006). the dna targeting sequences for pgk was 5⬘gcttctgggaacaaggttaaa3⬘ and for hif-1␣, 5⬘tacgttgtgagtggtattatt3⬘. the cells were harvested in ice-cold phosphate-buffered
saline containing 20 ␮m  xxxd1914xxx  (sigma) and extracted with
15% trichloroacetic acid for 10 min on ice. the supernatant containing the nucleoside and its phosphorylated forms was extracted with
a 45:55 ratio of trioctylamine/1,1,2-trichlorotrifluoroethane. the trichloroacetic acid-insoluble pellet representing the nucleotide incorporated into the dna was washed twice and resolubilized in  xxxd1896xxx  before evaluation using a scintillation counter
(ls5000td; beckman coulter, fullerton, ca). the nucleoside analog metabolites were analyzed by high-pressure liquid chromatography (shimadzu, braintree, ma) connected to a detector (radiomatic
150tr flow scintillation analyzer; perkinelmer life and analytical
sciences) using a partisil sax column (whatman, clifton, nj). all
results are means and standard deviations obtained from at least
three experiments.
chromatin immunoprecipitation (chip) assay to study the
interaction of hif-1␣ and pgk promoter. the cells cultured
under either normoxic or hypoxic conditions for 24 h were incubated
with 1% formaldehyde at 37°c for 15 min. cells were washed with
ice-cold pbs and lysed in chip buffer (1% triton x-100, 0.1%  xxxd1835xxx , 50 mm tris 8.1, 150 mm nacl, and 5 mm edta) followed by
sonication to produce approximately 1 kilobase of dna fragments.
the samples were precleared with salmon sperm dna-saturated
protein a/g-agarose (calbiochem, san diego, ca) before a 24-h incubation with anti-hif-1␣ antibody (bd bioscience pharmingen,
franklin lakes, nj) at 4°c. salmon sperm dna-saturated protein
a/g-agarose was added to precipitate the protein-dna complexes.
the complexes were sequentially washed once with chip buffer,
chip buffer containing 500 mm nacl, and then licl wash buffer.
the beads were washed twice with tris-edta buffer before elution
at 65°c in 1% sds and tris-edta buffer. supernatants were incubated overnight at 65°c to reverse cross-links, and the dna was
purified using a gel extraction kit (qiagen, valencia, ca). the
presence of the pgk promoter dna was determined by pcr.  xxxg171xxx 
promoter was used as the control. the sequences of pgk primer
pairs were 5⬘-gaaggttccttgcggttc-3⬘ (forward) and 5⬘-ctagtgagacgtgcggctt-3⬘ (reverse), and the sequences of  xxxg171xxx  primer pairs were
5⬘-gtctccgtcacgtggtgtcag-3⬘ (forward) and 5⬘-ggttaggaggagctaggctg3⬘(reverse).
luciferase reporter assay. the dna fragment with pgkhre⫻5 [(gccggacgtgacaaacgg)⫻5agatctagcggagactatagagggtatataagggcctcggcggcc] or controlx5 [(gccggaattgacaaacgg)⫻5agatctagcggagactatagagggtatataagggcctcggcggcc] was cloned into  xxxg2040xxx .20 ve-

of l-oddcmp from the 3⬘ termini of dna by  xxxg171xxx  (chou
and cheng, 2000; lam et al., 2006).
the primary function of pgk, a 46-kda glycolytic protein,
is to use 1,3-biphosphoglycerate as a phosphate donor to
generate one molecule of atp during glycolysis. in hypoxic
conditions, atp synthesis depends on glycolysis in the cytoplasm instead of occurring via oxidative phosphorylation in
mitochondria. the up-regulation of glycolytic enzymes such
as pgk under hypoxic conditions has been postulated to be
one of the compensatory mechanisms for ensuring enough
atp generation. pgk was identified as one of the hif-1␣
target genes based on the presence of hypoxia response elements (hre) (acgtg or gcgtg) in the promoter region (kress et
al., 1998; okino et al., 1998).
because hypoxic conditions (oxygen partial pressure 5–10
mm hg; 0.7%–1.4% oxygen in gas phase) are commonly detected in solid tumors (brown and wilson, 2004) and hypoxia
has been shown to enhance only pgk expression and not
pgk excretion in tumor cells (daly et al., 2004). we hypothesize that hypoxic conditions in tumors may facilitate the
synthesis of the triphosphate metabolite of l-oddc through
the action of pgk activated by hif-1␣. l-oddc is therefore a
potential drug for preferential inhibition of hypoxic tumor
growth.
we report here the effect of hypoxic treatment (1% o2, 5%
co2, 94% n2) on the expression of pgk and  xxxg171xxx , and the
cytotoxicity of l-oddc and  xxxd2188xxx  in human tumor cell lines,
including hepg2, hep3b, a673, panc-1, and rko, and the
metabolism of l-oddc and  xxxd2188xxx  in panc-1 cells.

respiration. we optimized the growth of tumor cells under
hypoxic conditions by increasing the glucose concentration to
4.5 g/liter and by adding 25 mm hepes buffer, ph 7.4, to the
culture medium (results not shown). under these cell culture
conditions, the growth rates of all cell lines (hepg2, hep3b,
panc-1, and a673) under hypoxic conditions were approximately 50% lower than that under normoxic conditions (supplemental fig. 1). culture medium with 4.5 g/liter glucose
and 25 mm hepes buffer was used in the following experiments.
induction of hif-1␣ in tumor cell lines under hypoxic conditions (1% o2, 5% co2, 94% n2). hif-1␣ is the
key isoform of the hypoxia-inducible factors for activating the
transcription of most hypoxia-inducible genes, including
pgk. we tested whether hypoxic conditions (1% o2, 5% co2,
94% n2) could induce hif-1␣ expression. as shown in fig.
1a, hif-1␣ was induced in different tumor cell lines after 24
and 48 h of hypoxic treatment. the basal levels of hif-1␣ in
different cell lines are very low under normoxic conditions.
the induced hif-1␣ was translocated into nuclei in different
cell lines as shown in the immunofluorescence micrographs
(fig. 1b).
the induction of pgk mrna and protein expression by hypoxic treatment. the effect of hypoxia on the
mrna expression levels of pgk responsible for the l-oddctp formation, and  xxxg171xxx  exonuclease activity, which can
remove the incorporated l-oddcmp from the 3⬘ dna terminus and cause l-oddc resistance in cell culture was determined by quantitative real time rt-pcr. after 24- and 48-h
hypoxic treatment, pgk mrna expression levels in different
cell lines increased 4- to 5-fold (fig. 2a). the expression of
 xxxg171xxx  mrna was not affected by the hypoxic treatment (data
not shown). there were interactions between hif-1␣ protein
and the promoter region of pgk gene (⫺352 to ⫺ 264 base
pairs, where two hre sites could be identified), under hypoxic conditions (1% o2, 5% co2, 94% n2) as determined by
chromatin immunoprecipitation assay (fig. 2b). results
from luciferase reporter assays indicated that the hre of the
pgk promoter mediates the transcriptional response to hypoxia (fig. 2c). the results of the chromatin immunoprecipitation assay and the luciferase reporter assay suggest that
the induction of pgk mrna could be due to increased binding activity between the hif-1␣ transcription factors and the
hre of the pgk promoter under hypoxic conditions. the
effect of hypoxia on the levels and the subcellular distributions of pgk protein and  xxxg171xxx  protein in different cell lines
were also studied. results from western blotting indicated
that the protein levels of only pgk and not  xxxg171xxx  were
induced approximately 2- to 3-fold in different cell lines (fig.
2d). immunofluorescence micrographs showed that hypoxia
had no effect on the subcellular distributions of pgk protein,
which was present mostly in cytoplasm, and the  xxxg171xxx  protein, which was present in nuclei (fig. 2e).
the expression of  xxxg1568xxx  h1,  xxxg478xxx , and  xxxg611xxx  protein under hypoxic conditions. in addition to pgk
protein, we examined the impact of hypoxia on several key
enzymes,  xxxg611xxx  (l-oddc and  xxxd2188xxx  to l-oddcmp and dfdcmp),  xxxg478xxx  (l-oddcmp and dfdcmp to l-oddcdp and
dfdcdp), and  xxxg1568xxx  h1 (dfdcdp to dfdctp), responsible
for different phosphorylation steps of l-oddc and  xxxd2188xxx .
western blot results indicated that the levels of these
proteins in different cell lines were quite different. how-

ctor (promega, madison, wi) via the nhei and hindiii restriction
sites. the cells were transiently transfected for 24 h using the control- xxxg2040xxx .20 vector or the pgk-hre⫻5- xxxg2040xxx .20 vector with fugene6 transfection reagent (roche, indianapolis, in). the cells were
then incubated under normoxic and hypoxic conditions for 24 h.
transcriptional activity was determined by measuring the activity of
firefly luciferase in a multiwell plate luminometer (tecan, durham,
nc) using luciferase reporter assay (promega) according to the
manufacturer’s instructions.
quantitative real-time pcr. total rna was isolated from
hepg2 cells, hep3b cells, panc-1, and a673 using a high-pure rna
purification kit that includes a step of dnase treatment (roche). the
purified rna was used as a negative control for indicating the
absence of genomic dna in the pcr reaction. the reverse-transcriptase reaction was performed using platinum quantitative rtpcr thermoscript one-step system (invitrogen), according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. assays were performed using the icycler iq realtime thermocycler detection system (bio-rad laboratories). the primers and probes used for the quantitative real-time
pcr are shown in table 1.
statistical analysis. data were analyzed by two-way analysis of
variance (prism 4 software; graphpad software, san diego, ca),
student’s t test (microsoft excel; microsoft corp., redmond, wa),
and one-way analysis of variance (graphpad prism 4). the difference was considered statistically significant at p ⬍ 0.05.

the impact of hypoxia on the cytotoxicity of  xxxd3453xxx 

50% (dfdctp is shown in fig. 4c, and the other forms of
 xxxd2188xxx  are shown in supplemental fig. 3, d–f) and also decreased the  xxxd2188xxx  incorporation into cellular dna approximately 50% within 8 h of incubation (fig. 4d). the difference
in the levels of  xxxd2188xxx  metabolites and dna incorporation
under normoxic and hypoxic conditions was decreased after
24-h exposure to  xxxd2188xxx . the addition of dmog has no significant effect on the level of dfdctp or the incorporation of
 xxxd2188xxx  into dna in both conditions (fig. 4, h and i, and
supplemental fig. 4b).
the effect of hypoxic treatment on the mrna expression of nucleoside transporters  xxxg2129xxx ,  xxxg2130xxx 
hent1, hent2, and mrp5. because hypoxic treatment
decreased the uptake of  xxxd2188xxx  that is dependent on nucleoside transporters, but not l-oddc, uptake of which is not
dependent on nucleoside transporters (gourdeau et al.,
2001), we examined whether hypoxic treatment affected the
mrna expression of nucleoside transporters, which can reflect the protein level to some extent. rt-pcr results indicated that the mrna expression of hent1, hent2, and
 xxxg2130xxx  was repressed to different extents in different cell
lines after hypoxic treatment from 24 to 48 h (fig. 5a). the
mrna expression of hent1 decreased approximately 50% in
different cell lines under hypoxic conditions. the mrna expression of hent2 decreased by 50% in hep3b cells and only
20% in the other three cell lines. the mrna expression of
 xxxg2130xxx  decreased by 70% in hepg2 and hep3b and 50 to
60% in panc-1 and a673 cells under hypoxic conditions (fig.
5b). the mrna expression of  xxxg2129xxx  and mrp5 was not
affected by hypoxic treatment. under hypoxic conditions, the
underexpression of hent1, hent2, and  xxxg2130xxx  decreased
on thymidine uptake and incorporation in panc-1 cells (supplemental fig. 2).
the effect of hypoxia on the cytotoxicity of l-oddc
and  xxxd2188xxx  in different cell lines. we studied whether
the increase of l-oddctp after hypoxic treatment would
increase the cytotoxicity of the cancer cells. under normoxic
conditions, different cell lines have different susceptibilities

ever, hypoxia had no effect on the level of these proteins in
all the cell lines studied (fig. 3).
the effect of hypoxic treatment on the phosphorylation and incorporation of l-oddc and  xxxd2188xxx  in
panc-1 cells. the accumulation rates of the total metabolites of l-oddc were similar under both normoxic and hypoxic conditions. hypoxic treatment significantly increased
the intracellular amount of l-oddctp (approximately 40%)
(p ⬍ 0.0001) after 24-h incubation with l-oddc (fig. 4a);
however, hypoxic treatment had no effect on the amount of
l-oddc, l-oddcmp, and l-oddcdp (p ⬎ 0.05) (supplemental fig. 3, a–c). this result is consistent with the pgk
protein induced in the hypoxic conditions, but not  xxxg611xxx  protein and  xxxg478xxx  protein. the hypoxic conditions induced pgk
protein 3-fold but only increased the amount of l-oddctp by
40%. this suggests that pgk protein may be above the
rate-limiting state. the hypoxic treatment also increased the
l-oddc incorporation into cellular dna by 25% (p ⬍ 0.05) in
panc-1 cells after 24 h incubation with l-oddc (fig. 4b).
again, this result correlates with the increase of l-oddctp
under hypoxic conditions. to show that the increase in loddctp level and the l-oddc incorporation into dna was
not due to a change in the cellular redox status under hypoxic
conditions, dimethyloxallyl glycine (dmog), a prolyl hydroxylase inhibitor, was added to induce hif-1␣ under normoxic
conditions. the induction of hif-1␣ by addition of 500 ␮m
dmog increased the pgk expression under normoxic conditions (fig. 4e). dmog also increased the level of l-oddctp
and the incorporation of l-oddc into dna significantly (p ⬍
0.05) (fig. 4, f and g). the addition of dmog under hypoxic
conditions did not affect the level of l-oddctp and the incorporation of l-oddc into dna.
the accumulation of the  xxxd2188xxx  metabolites increased from
2 to 8 h under normoxic conditions (fig. 4c and supplemental
fig. 3, d–f). the amount of  xxxd2188xxx  incorporation into dna
over time correlated with the level of dfdctp at different
time points (fig. 4, c and d). hypoxic treatment decreased
all of the phosphorylated forms of  xxxd2188xxx  by approximately

to l-oddc and  xxxd2188xxx . because the dna synthesis rate and
cell growth were reduced by 50% under hypoxic conditions,
cells were treated with drugs according to their generation
time under different conditions. clonogenic assays results
indicated that hypoxic treatment could sensitize hepg2,
a673, and rko cells by approximately 2-fold and hep3b and
panc-1 cells by approximately 3-fold (table 2). for panc-1
cells, with the normalization of the incorporation rate of

l-oddc

(25% increase) against the dna synthesis rate
under hypoxic conditions, the incorporation rate of l-oddc
per dna synthesis increased to approximately 2.5-fold,
and this was consistent with the increased l-oddc cytotoxicity under hypoxic conditions. because the incorporation rate of  xxxd2188xxx  and dna synthesis rate dropped to the

discussion
most solid tumors have areas of hypoxia because of the
abnormal development of a blood vascular system. hypoxic
conditions induce hypoxia-inducible factors that interact
with hypoxia response elements of the target gene promoters,
resulting in the expression of many proteins such as glycolytic enzymes and angiogenic factors. activation of this transcriptional program can result in more aggressive and metastatic cancer phenotypes and is associated with resistance
to radiation therapy, chemotherapy, and poor treatment outcomes. to overcome this problem, different approaches have

sis showed no difference, and the cytotoxicity of  xxxd2188xxx  was
not affected by hypoxia (table 2).

induced expression of hif-1␣ and pgk, and increased the
level of l-oddctp and the incorporation of l-oddc into dna
(fig. 4, e–g), and also sensitized panc-1 cells to l-oddc
approximately 2.8-fold under normoxic conditions (table 2).
the importance of pgk and hif-1␣ in l-oddc cytotoxicity
under normoxic and hypoxic conditions was further demonstrated in rko cells. first, overexpression of pgk using
transient transfection increased the level of l-oddctp and
the incorporation of l-oddc into dna but not  xxxd2188xxx  under
normoxic conditions (supplemental figs. 5–7). the overexpression of pgk also sensitized rko cells to l-oddc approximately 1.6-fold but not  xxxd2188xxx  under normoxic conditions
(table 2). the transient transfection of pgk did not further
increase the cytotoxicity of l-oddc under hypoxic conditions;
perhaps the level of pgk had reached the maximum level
under hypoxic conditions. second, down-regulation of hif-1␣
using shrna by adding doxycycline decreased the levels of
pgk and l-oddctp and the incorporation of l-oddc into
dna but not that of  xxxd2188xxx  under hypoxic conditions (supplemental figs. 5–7). the knockdown of hif-1␣ reduced the

the impact of hypoxia on the cytotoxicity of  xxxd3453xxx 

hypoxia is likely to be a key factor contributing to the anticancer nucleoside analog resistance via the down-regulation
of nucleoside transporters. currently, the combined use of
anticancer nucleosides and antiangiogenic compounds that
are likely to increase the hypoxic status in tumors are being
tried in the clinic. based on our findings, we suggest that
anticancer nucleosides in which uptake is dependent on the
nucleoside transporters should be applied before antiangiogenic compounds. the retention of these nucleosides may be
increased because antiangiogenic compounds may induce
hypoxia and reduce the expression of nucleoside transporters. however, in the clinical trials of l-oddc, the antiangiogenic compounds should be applied before l-oddc to create
more hypoxic conditions and thereby induce the expression of
pgk. in conclusion, hypoxia is an important factor that may
potentiate the activity of l-oddc.

reports, the induction of pgk under hypoxic conditions is a
common phenomenon. when we compared the cytotoxicity of
l-oddc and  xxxd2188xxx  in hepg2, hep3b, a673, panc-1, and rko
cells under normoxic and hypoxic conditions, we found that
the tumor cells were sensitized to l-oddc to different extents
depending on the different cell types under hypoxic conditions but not to  xxxd2188xxx . the results from the metabolism of
l-oddc demonstrated that the increase in sensitivity to loddc was due to the increase of l-oddctp formation and
l-oddc incorporation into dna under hypoxic conditions.
our results also indicate that hypoxic conditions in culture
do not alter the expression of  xxxg171xxx , which preferentially
excises l-oddcmp and misincorporated nucleotides from the
3⬘-termini of dna in all of these cell types. under normoxic
conditions, dmog induced pgk through the stabilization of
hif-1␣ and sensitized panc-1 cells to l-oddc. this result
suggests that the change in the cellular redox status under
hypoxic conditions is not the primary factor in the cytotoxicity of l-oddc. furthermore, the cytotoxicity of l-oddc in
rko cells correlates with the expression level of pgk in both
normoxic and hypoxic conditions and to the level of hif-1␣
under hypoxic conditions. collectively, our results demonstrate that hypoxia can induce pgk expression through the
control of hif-1␣ and causes sensitization of tumor cells to
l-oddc in culture. these findings provide a rationale for
clinical development of l-oddc as a treatment for solid tumors, because clinical reports indicate that the development
of hypoxia resulting in the expression of hif-1␣ in solid
tumors is common (brown and wilson, 2004). hypoxia may
be the reason for the overexpression of pgk in some solid
tumors [e.g., pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (hwang et
al., 2006),  xxxg721xxx -positive breast tumors (zhang et al.,
2005) and lung adenocarcinoma (chen et al., 2003)]. because
most renal cell carcinomas have defects in the von hippellindau gene and hif-1␣ and its downstream proteins are
continuously overexpressing (patel et al., 2006), testing of
the sensitivity of l-oddc in renal cell carcinomas is under
investigation.
it is noteworthy that  xxxd2188xxx  uptake was severely reduced
under hypoxic conditions, but not l-oddc uptake, which is
not dependent upon the nucleoside transporters (gourdeau
et al., 2001). we studied the effect of hypoxia on the mrna
expression of the nucleoside transporters. our results indicate that mrna expression of hent1, hent2, and  xxxg2130xxx 
in different cell lines can be repressed to different extents.
the expression of  xxxg2129xxx  and mrp5, however, were not
repressed. these results could partially explain the decrease
in  xxxd2188xxx  uptake in panc-1 cells. this is consistent with recent
reports stating that hypoxia can repress the expression of
hent1 and/or hent2 in different cell lines [i.e., human
microvascular endothelial cells (eltzschig et al., 2005) and
human umbilical vein endothelial cells (casanello et al.,
2005)]. clinical reports indicate that decreased expression of
hent1 can be correlated with treatment failure of  xxxd2188xxx  in
cancers, including mantle cell lymphoma (marcé et al., 2006),
pancreatic cancer (spratlin et al., 2004; giovannetti et al.,
2006), and non–small-cell lung cancer (achiwa et al., 2004).
because hent1, hent2, and  xxxg2130xxx  are also involved in the
uptake of many other anti-cancer nucleoside analogs [i.e.,
arabinofuranosyladenine,  xxxd1790xxx , 5⬘-deoxy-5-fluorouridine (kong et al., 2004 and podgorska et al., 2005;
