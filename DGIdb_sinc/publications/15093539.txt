summary
we have determined the 3.2 å x-ray crystal structure of the extracellular domain of the human  xxxg681xxx 
receptor 2 (erbb2 or her2) in a complex with the antigen binding fragment of  xxxd2890xxx , an anti-erbb2 monoclonal
antibody also known as 2c4 or  xxxd2890xxx .  xxxd2890xxx  binds to erbb2 near the center of domain ii, sterically blocking a
binding pocket necessary for receptor dimerization and signaling. the erbb2- xxxd2890xxx  structure, combined with earlier
mutagenesis data, defines the  xxxd2890xxx  residues essential for erbb2 interaction. to analyze the erbb2 side of the
interface, we have mutated a number of residues contacting  xxxd2890xxx  and examined the effects of these mutations on
 xxxd2890xxx  binding and erbb2- xxxg722xxx  heterodimerization. we have also shown that conserved residues previously shown
to be necessary for egf receptor homodimerization may be dispensible for erbb2- xxxg722xxx  heterodimerization.
introduction
 xxxg681xxx  receptors (also known as erbbs) and
their ligands exist in all higher eukaryotes, including c. elegans
(aroian et al., 1990) and drosophila (livneh et al., 1985; wadsworth et al., 1985), and have been implicated in a number of
cancers due to dysregulation or mutation of the  xxxg682xxx  genes
(burgess et al., 2003; holbro et al., 2003; yarden and sliwkowski, 2001). the mammalian  xxxg682xxx  system contains four receptors,
40%–45% identical to one another, which arose from a series
of gene duplications early in vertebrate evolution (stein and
staros, 2000). the erbbs have a common architecture, details
of which have been revealed recently by a series of structures
of the extracellular domains of egf receptor (egfr or  xxxg682xxx )
(ferguson et al., 2003; garrett et al., 2002; ogiso et al., 2002),
erbb2 (her2) (cho et al., 2003; garrett et al., 2003), and  xxxg722xxx 
( xxxg722xxx ) (cho and leahy, 2002), as well as the intracellular kinase
domain of egfr (stamos et al., 2002). the erbbs are type
1 transmembrane proteins, with a ligand binding extracellular
portion containing four domains (i, ii, iii, and iv), a single trans-

membrane helix, a  xxxg2198xxx  domain most closely related
to the janus kinases and in the same family as other receptor
tyrosine kinases (hanks and hunter, 1995), and a c-terminal
tail (the length of which varies between family members) containing a number of tyrosine phosphorylation sites that serve
as a scaffold for adaptor molecules and enzymes to facilitate
downstream signaling (jorissen et al., 2003; schlessinger,
2000).
at least twelve ligands are known to bind mammalian erbbs,
including  xxxg681xxx  (egf) and neuregulins (or
heregulins) (falls, 2003). a comparison of structures of  xxxg722xxx 
and egf receptor monomers versus a ligand-bound egfr dimer shows that the ligand binds at a site between domains i and
iii and induces (or at least stabilizes) a dramatic conformational
change in the receptor extracellular domain (cho and leahy,
2002; ferguson et al., 2003; garrett et al., 2002; ogiso et al.,
2002). erbb2 is the only  xxxg682xxx  for which no ligand has been
found; the structure of the erbb2 extracellular domain shows
that the ligand binding site has closed up so that domains i and
iii contact each other directly (cho et al., 2003; garrett et al.,

s i g n i f i c a n c e
erbb2 is overexpressed in a number of types of cancer, particularly breast cancer, where overexpression correlates strongly with a
more aggressive disease and poorer survival rates. the anti-erbb2 monoclonal antibody trastuzumab (herceptin) is indicated for
patients whose metastatic tumors overexpress erbb2. in contrast,  xxxd2890xxx  ( xxxd2890xxx ) is currently being evaluated in phase ii
clinical trials in patients whose breast, non-small cell lung, prostate, or ovarian tumors do not contain the amplified erbb2 gene. our
erbb2- xxxd2890xxx  structure clearly shows how  xxxd2890xxx  inhibits erbb2ⴕs function as a coreceptor in ligand-mediated  xxxg682xxx  signaling,
and provides a framework for interpretation of previous  xxxd2890xxx  mutagenesis data.

figure 1. the erbb2- xxxd2890xxx  complex
a: a ribbon representation of chains b, e, and f
from the erbb2- xxxd2890xxx  complex is shown in
stereo. erbb2 is colored by domain, with domain
i (residues 1–195) in green, domain ii (196–320)
in blue, domain iii (321–488) in purple, and domain iv (489–560) in gray.  xxxd2890xxx  is colored
by domain and chain, with the light chain variable domain (residues 1–109) in light yellow,
heavy chain variable domain (1–113) in gold,
light chain constant domain (110–214) in pink,
and heavy chain constant domain (114–216) in
red. glycosylation on erbb2 is shown in stick form,
with carbons colored green, nitrogens blue, and
oxygens red.
b: a composite-omit electron density map of a
portion of the erbb2- xxxd2890xxx  interface, contoured at 1.3 sigma, is shown as a blue mesh.
the refined erbb2- xxxd2890xxx  model is superimposed, with side chains in stick form and backbone in ribbon form. carbons are colored by

2003). the residues comprising the former binding site are not
conserved relative to the rest of the  xxxg682xxx  family (garrett et al.,
2003), suggesting that erbb2 is no longer capable of binding a
ligand.
ligand-induced dimerization provides the normal downstream signaling mechanism for the erbbs (burgess et al., 2003).
a possible structural mechanism for dimerization is suggested
by the ligand-induced conformational change. when unliganded, the extracellular domain of egfr and  xxxg722xxx  (and presumably  xxxg723xxx ) is in a “closed” conformation, with a ␤ hairpin
in domain ii interacting with a portion of domain iv (cho and
leahy, 2002; ferguson et al., 2003). in the ligand-bound, “open”
state, the domain ii hairpin now protrudes out from the rest of

318

the molecule, and makes most of the contacts seen in the egf
receptor dimer (garrett et al., 2002; ogiso et al., 2002). it should
be noted that the open conformation of egfr has not yet been
observed except in the context of an egfr homodimer. the
erbb2 extracellular domain is always in the open conformation,
even when monomeric (cho et al., 2003; garrett et al., 2003),
which may explain why it is the preferred dimerization partner
for the other three family members (graus-porta et al., 1997).
by mechanisms that are still unclear structurally, dimerization
brings the intracellular kinase domains of the two erbbs into
proximity, allowing transphosphorylation of tyrosines on the
c-terminal tail of one  xxxg682xxx  by the kinase domain of the other
(jorissen et al., 2003), and the consequent recruitment of various

enzymes and adaptor molecules for further downstream signaling (olayioye et al., 2000).
erbb2 overexpression in breast cancer correlates well with
increased tumor growth rates, higher metastatic potential, and
poorer long-term survival rates for the patient (holbro et al.,
2003; paik and liu, 2000; ross and fletcher, 1998; slamon
et al., 1987). a number of therapeutic approaches are being
developed to block the effects of erbb2 overexpression (arteaga, 2003; fry, 2003), including the humanized monoclonal
antibodies trastuzumab (carter et al., 2000) and  xxxd2890xxx 
(2c4 or  xxxd2890xxx ). trastuzumab is approved for metastatic
breast cancer patients whose tumors overexpress erbb2 (cobleigh et al., 1999; slamon et al., 2001; vogel et al., 2002), while
 xxxd2890xxx  is currently in phase ii clinical trials. trastuzumab
and  xxxd2890xxx  bind to different epitopes in the the extracellular
domain of erbb2, as has been seen functionally (fendly et al.,
1990) and structurally (cho et al., 2003, and this work).  xxxd2890xxx  binding mediates the same antibody-dependent cytotoxic
effects as trastuzumab binding (clynes et al., 2000) (k. totpal,
personal communication), although it does not block erbb2
shedding as trastuzumab does (molina et al., 2001). in addition
to cytotoxic effects,  xxxd2890xxx  binding directly inhibits erbb2
association with its partner receptors, blocking the signaling
cascade at its source (agus et al., 2002). in experimental systems where erbb2 is activated but not overexpressed, the fab
fragment of  xxxd2890xxx , which will not cause antibody-dependent cytotoxicity, appears to be just as effective as the intact
mab at inhibiting erbb2-mediated signaling, in contrast to the
ineffectiveness of the trastuzumab fab (agus et al., 2002; kelley
et al., 1992). this property may explain why  xxxd2890xxx , unlike
trastuzumab, is effective against a broad range of cancers which
do not express erbb2 at high levels (agus et al., 2000, 2002;
mann et al., 2001; mendoza et al., 2002).
to more fully understand the mechanism of action of  xxxd2890xxx , we have determined the cocrystal structure of the  xxxd2890xxx  fab bound to the extracellular domain of erbb2. this
structure represents the pharmacologically relevant complex,
given the efficacy of the  xxxd2890xxx  fab in vitro and in vivo
(agus et al., 2002). previous structural and mutagenic analysis
of  xxxd2890xxx  (vajdos et al., 2002) can now be reinterpreted
to provide an understanding of  xxxd2890xxx  binding from one
side of the interface. to analyze the other side of the interface,
we have mutated a number of erbb2 residues in and around
the  xxxd2890xxx  binding site, and examined the effects of these
mutations on  xxxd2890xxx  binding, as well as erbb2- xxxg722xxx  heterodimerization. finally, the overlap between the  xxxd2890xxx 
binding site on erbb2 and the probable heterodimer interface
suggests that the binding of the antibody sterically interferes
with erbb2 dimerization and signaling.
results
erbb2- xxxd2890xxx  structure
the soluble extracellular domain of erbb2 (hudziak and ullrich,
1991) was crystallized in complex with the fab fragment of the
anti-erbb2 monoclonal antibody  xxxd2890xxx  (2c4) (vajdos et
al., 2002). the structure of this complex was solved to 3.25 å
by molecular replacement with the program amore (navaza,
1994), using the structure of rat erbb2 extracellular domain
(cho et al., 2003) as a search model. there are two erbb2pertuzumab complexes in the asymmetric unit of this crystal,

related by a noncrystallographic 2-fold axis next to residue 162
in domain i; this domain i-domain i interaction buries only 500 å2
per monomer and is probably not biologically relevant. one
complex (chains b, e, and f) is slightly better ordered than the
other, and is shown in figure 1a. after finding both copies of
erbb2 by molecular replacement, it was possible to locate the
variable domains of the two  xxxd2890xxx  fabs in a subsequent
molecular replacement search, then finally place the constant
domain of the fabs. the structure has been refined to an r
factor of 22.4% (free r 26.8%), with acceptable model geometry
(table 1). while peripheral portions of the structure are not well
ordered (see below), the interface between erbb2 and  xxxd2890xxx  has clear electron density (figure 1b).
the structure of erbb2 in the erbb2- xxxd2890xxx  complex
is very similar to its structure alone and in complex with trastuzumab (cho et al., 2003). the extracellular domain of erbb2 is
divided into four domains, designated i, ii, iii, and iv (figure
1a). i and iii are structurally very similar: a repeating sequence
of hydrophobic residues, largely leucines, causes these domains to fold into a “␤ helix” with sides formed by three parallel
␤ sheets. this architecture is distantly related to the classical
leucine-rich repeats (ward and garrett, 2001). residues 102–
110 form an insertion in the leucine repeat motif of domain i,
and are disordered in this structure. domains ii and iv are also
similar to each other in structure, being composed of disulfidebonded modules, small structural units held together by one or
two disulfide bonds (burgess et al., 2003). domain ii contains
seven disulfide-bonded modules, with an eighth module being
structurally part of domain i. unlike domain iv, domain ii contains an insertion (residues 247–266) in its central disulfidebonded module which forms a ␤ hairpin that protrudes from

the rest of the protein. this ␤ hairpin protrusion is also seen in
each monomer of the egfr homodimer, where it forms one
side of the dimerization interface (garrett et al., 2002; ogiso et
al., 2002). when compared to the structure of erbb2 alone (cho
et al., 2003), domain iv in the erbb2- xxxd2890xxx  complex is

320

rotated by ⵑ20⬚ relative to the rest of the protein. this domain
has little contact with domain iii, and is positioned in this crystal
primarily by contacts with symmetry-related fab molecules.
electron density for domain iv steadily deteriorates with increasing distance from domain iii, eventually becoming untraceable

after residue 550 (in chain a; 560 in chain b). the erbb2 in this
complex is more heavily glycosylated (ⵑ20 kda of sugar by
sds-page) than the material used in previous crystal structures
(cho et al., 2003), and each of the four n-linked glycosylation
sites in the ordered portion of the protein has 1–3 well-ordered
sugars attached to it (figure 1a).
outside of the complementarity-determining regions (cdrs),
 xxxd2890xxx  is identical in sequence to trastuzumab (carter et
al., 1992); consequently, the local structure of the  xxxd2890xxx 
fab in the erbb2- xxxd2890xxx  complex is largely the same as
that of the trastuzumab fab, the chief difference being that
the elbow angle (the angle between the variable and constant
domains of the fab) is 175⬚, ⵑ20⬚ larger than in the structure
of the trastuzumab fab (eigenbrot et al., 1993), and ⵑ30⬚ larger
than in the structure of the  xxxd2890xxx  fab alone (vajdos et
al., 2002). the conformation of cdr h3 has been substantially
altered by binding to erbb2, compared to the largely similar
conformations of this loop in free  xxxd2890xxx  and in trastuzumab (eigenbrot et al., 1993; vajdos et al., 2002). the constant
domains of the two  xxxd2890xxx  fabs do not obey the same
noncrystallographic symmetry as the rest of the complex, being
positioned primarily by nonequivalent crystal contacts. the constant domain of one of the two fabs (chains c and d) is poorly
ordered, although the variable domain for this fab is well ordered.
erbb2- xxxd2890xxx  binding interface
the  xxxd2890xxx  fab is bound to erbb2 near the junction of
domains i, ii, and iii (figure 1a). this contact buries 1210 å2 on
the erbb2 side of the interface, with 1147 å2 in domain ii and
only 63 å2 in domain i. contact is primarily made with the heavy
chain of the fab (878 å2 versus 236 å2 for the light chain). as
expected, most of the erbb2- xxxd2890xxx  contacts involve the
cdrs of the fab, although the dimerization hairpin of domain
ii lies along the side of the heavy chain variable domain (figure
2a). despite the contact with the fab, the conformation of the
dimerization hairpin is essentially the same as that seen in the
free and trastuzumab-bound erbb2 structures as well as that
in the egf receptor dimer: 0.7, 1.0, and 1.3 å c␣ rmsd, respectively, for 59 residues surrounding the ␤ hairpin (cho et al.,
2003; ogiso et al., 2002).
the interface between erbb2 and  xxxd2890xxx  is primarily
polar, with few hydrophobic or charged residues in the interface.
the largest hydrophobic patch lies outside the main cdr surface, between ile 58 and tyr 59 (heavy chain), tyr 94 (light
chain), and tyr 252 and phe 257 (erbb2). (for consistency with
previous work on the  xxxd2890xxx  fab [vajdos et al., 2002], we
have chosen to use a modified kabat numbering rather than
sequential numbering for  xxxd2890xxx  residues.) residues
30–32 on cdr h1 and 52–53 on cdr h2 make an extensive
network of hydrogen bonds with main chain and side chain
atoms (figure 2b). his 245 of erbb2 is tightly sandwiched between ile 244 and gly 55 of cdr h2. although not technically
a cdr, the loop containing residues 72–76 makes contacts with
erbb2, including the only contact with domain i, a hydrogen
bond between lys 75 of  xxxd2890xxx  and gln 156 of erbb2.
finally, cdr h3 makes hydrophobic and hydrogen bond contacts with residues lys 311 and his 296 of erbb2. his 296 is
thoroughly buried upon  xxxd2890xxx  binding, being surrounded
by tyr 49 and tyr 55 of the light chain, and leu 96 and tyr  xxxd893xxx 
(modified kabat numbering) of the heavy chain (figure 2c).

figure 3. effect of alanine substitutions on  xxxd2890xxx  binding to erbb2
a: binding of  xxxd2890xxx  fab to various erbb2 mutants was measured by
elisa as described in the experimental procedures; curves are shown for
wild-type (wt) erbb2 and for selected mutants with little or no effect (t290a
or p315a), a moderate effect (s288a or h296a), or a severe effect (s288a/
h296a or l295p/h296n) on  xxxd2890xxx  binding. error bars represent the
standard error from three experiments.
b: ec50 values determined by elisa for various erbb2 single and double
mutants are shown normalized by the ec50 for wild-type erbb2 (3 nm). the
s288a/h296a, l295a/h296a, and l295p/h296n double mutants had no detectable binding to  xxxd2890xxx , as indicated by asterisks.

erbb2 mutagenesis and  xxxd2890xxx  inhibition
to assess the relative importance of the  xxxd2890xxx  fab-erbb2
binding interactions described above, and to complement previous  xxxd2890xxx  mutagenesis studies (vajdos et al., 2002), binding affinities were determined for a number of select erbb2
mutants. alanine or other substitutions were made in the context
of full-length erbb2 that was epitope tagged with gd (paborsky
et al., 1990; schaefer et al., 1999) to allow for verification of
expression and to facilitate binding analysis. recombinant
erbb2 proteins were expressed transiently in cos-7 cells, which
were then lysed with nonionic detergent. erbb2 was then captured from these lysates on anti-gd coated plates.  xxxd2890xxx 
fab binding affinities to the captured erbb2 were measured
by elisa. the ec50 for each mutant was determined using a
4-parameter fit of the binding curves (figure 3a), and these data
were used to calculate the ec50 ratio for the mutant versus the
wild-type (the mut/wt ratio) to give a measure of the severity of
each mutation (figure 3b). ratios greater than 1 indicate a
deleterious mutation. alanine substitution in any one of residues
his 245, val 286, ser 288, leu 295, his 296, or lys 311 significantly reduces  xxxd2890xxx  fab binding affinity for erbb2, while
substitution in residues phe 257, thr 268, thr 290, and pro 315
results in mut/wt ratios not significantly above 1. double alanine

figure 4. effect of erbb2 alanine substitutions on erbb2- xxxg722xxx  heterodimerization
a: cos-7 cells were cotransfected with erbb2 wild-type (left panel) or the erbb2(s288a/h296a) double alanine mutant (right panel) along with  xxxg722xxx .
transfected cells were pretreated with or without 100 nm  xxxd2890xxx  for 1 hr, and stimulated with 2 nm hrg or binding buffer as indicated for 10 min at
room temperature. lysates were prepared and erbb2- xxxg722xxx  heterodimers were immunoprecipitated with agarose-coupled polyclonal anti- xxxg722xxx  antibody,
and erbb2 receptor activation was evaluated by western blotting with phosphospecific anti-erbb2 antibody (␣-perbb2), or anti-gd antibody (␣-gd) to
detect erbb2- xxxg722xxx  complexes. lysates were evaluated for expression of erbb2 and  xxxg722xxx  construct expression with anti-gd or anti- xxxg722xxx  (␣- xxxg722xxx ) antibodies,
respectively.
b: a sequence alignment of human erbb2 and neu is shown for a portion of domain ii. the bars above each residue indicate the fraction of the side chain
solvent-accessible surface area, which is buried upon  xxxd2890xxx  binding.
c: cos-7 cells were cotransfected with alanine mutant erbb2 and wild-type  xxxg722xxx  expression plasmids, stimulated with 2 nm hrg for 10 min at room
temperature, and assayed for hrg-dependent erbb2 phosphorylation and heterodimerization in a coimmunoprecipitation assay similar to that presented in a.

substitutions in contact residues 245/296, 286/296, or 311/296
reduce binding further, and the 288/296 double mutation lacks
any detectable binding to  xxxd2890xxx  fab in this assay. in
addition, the  xxxd2890xxx  fab is unable to prevent hrg-dependent heterodimerization of the 288/296 double mutant erbb2
with  xxxg722xxx  (figure 4a). in agreement with our previous studies
(agus et al., 2002), trastuzumab has little effect on erbb2- xxxg722xxx 
heterodimerization.
specificity of  xxxd2890xxx  for human erbb2
 xxxd2890xxx  is specific for human erbb2 and does not bind to
rodent erbb2 (neu) with detectable affinity (fendly et al., 1990).
there are five residues in domain ii which differ between human
and rat erbb2, and only two (leu 295 and his 296) make significant side chain contacts with the  xxxd2890xxx  fab (figure 4b).
substitution of residues l295 and/or h296 in erbb2 with neu
residues (l295p, h296n, or l295p/h296n) is sufficient to eliminate detectable binding to  xxxd2890xxx  (figure 3b). these substitutions also reduce the ability of  xxxd2890xxx  to inhibit hrg-

322

dependent receptor phosphorylation. while  xxxd2890xxx  can
block hrg-dependent activation in wild-type erbb2 transfected
cells, inhibition is not observed in erbb2(l295p/h296n) transfected cells (supplemental figure s1 as http://www.cancercell.
org/cgi/content/full/5/4/317/dc1).
erbb2 heterodimerization with  xxxg722xxx 
and the  xxxd2890xxx  binding site
a number of erbb2 residues in and around the  xxxd2890xxx 
binding site are homologous to egfr residues necessary for
homodimerization (ogiso et al., 2002). to test the importance
of these residues in an erbb2/ xxxg722xxx  heterodimer, alanine substitutions were made at erbb2 residues tyr 252, phe 257, glu
258, phe 269, leu 295, and his 296 corresponding respectively
to egfr residues tyr 246, tyr 251, gln 252, phe 263, ala 289,
and asp 290; the erbb2 double mutants y252a/e258a, y252a/
f263a, and l295a/h296a were also tested. only the l295a/
h296a double mutant was able to impair hrg-dependent receptor erbb2- xxxg722xxx  heterodimerization (figure 4c), although

smaller effects on heterodimerization could very well be below
the sensitivity limits of our assay. none of the other  xxxd2890xxx 
contact single alanine mutations discussed above had any effect
on erbb2 heterodimerization (supplemental figure s2).
discussion
 xxxd2890xxx  binds at the erbb2
heterodimerization interface
the central portions of domain ii in erbb2 and egfr are highly
homologous and represent the majority of the dimerization interface observed in egfr (garrett et al., 2002; ogiso et al., 2002).
since this region overlaps with the binding epitope of  xxxd2890xxx  (figure 5a), an analysis of residues in this area should
shed light on both  xxxd2890xxx  binding and erbb2 dimerization.
surface-exposed residues on  xxxd2890xxx  and erbb2 can be
part of one or both of two binding epitopes: a structural epitope,
defined by the contacts between the two molecules, and a
functional epitope, determined by previous mutagenesis of the
 xxxd2890xxx  fab (vajdos et al., 2002) and our mutagenesis of
erbb2. the overlap between these two epitopes (figure 5) defines the essential contacts between  xxxd2890xxx  and erbb2.
 xxxd2890xxx ’s light and heavy chains play different
roles in erbb2 binding
the light chain of the  xxxd2890xxx  fab makes only a few contacts
with erbb2, mostly via cdr l2, and none of the contact residues
affects erbb2 binding when mutated (vajdos et al., 2002). conversely, light-chain residues which do affect binding when mutated do so indirectly, since none of these residues contacts
erbb2 (figure 5b). the picture is quite different for the  xxxd2890xxx  heavy chain, where 24 residues contact erbb2 directly;
seven of these affect binding by at least 75-fold when mutated
(figure 5b). these essential residues form an extensive hydrogen
bond network with erbb2, as discussed previously (figure 2b),
and occupy a compact patch on the surface of the  xxxd2890xxx 
fab. vajdos et al. (2002) observed a similar, if less compact, patch
from their mutagenic analysis of the  xxxd2890xxx  fab alone.
certain residues of erbb2 are essential for  xxxd2890xxx 
binding and heterodimerization
on the erbb2 side of the interface, the s288a mutant is 6-fold
weaker in  xxxd2890xxx  binding, probably due to the loss of the
hydrogen bonds between ser 288 of erbb2 and asp 31 of the
fab. in contrast, thr 290 also hydrogen bonds to asp 31, yet
the t290a mutant has almost no detectable loss in  xxxd2890xxx 
binding. while our limited resolution prevents any detailed analysis of hydrogen bonds, ser 288 does make two hydrogen bonds
to  xxxd2890xxx , while thr 290 only makes one, perhaps explaining the different effects of these mutations. the double
alanine substitutions v286a/h296a and l295a/h296a have
dramatic effects on  xxxd2890xxx  binding due to the loss of multiple hydrophobic interactions with the fab, as well as the hydrogen bond to tyr  xxxd893xxx . additionally,  xxxd2890xxx  will not bind to
rodent erbb2 (fendly et al., 1990), probably due to the substitution of a proline for leu 295 and an asparagine for his 296.
indeed, the l295p/h296n double mutant of human erbb2 is
severely impaired in  xxxd2890xxx  binding. the patch of  xxxd2890xxx  residues necessary for erbb2 binding (figure 5b) is mirrored by a cluster of erbb2 residues important for  xxxd2890xxx 
binding (figure 5a), confirming that our structure has captured

to those egfr residues which contact the dimerization hairpin are shown
in white (some atoms may be colored pink due to  xxxd2890xxx  contact).
individual atoms in erbb2 which directly contact  xxxd2890xxx  atoms (⬍3.2 å

 xxxd2890xxx  fab sterically interferes
with erbb2 heterodimerization
our structure provides a clear explanation for the inhibition of
erbb2-mediated signaling by  xxxd2890xxx , and validates the
model of erbb2 heterodimerization based on the structure of
the egfr homodimer (figures 6a–6h). the  xxxd2890xxx  binding
epitope overlaps with a region which, by modeling and by ho-

top-down (a, c, e, and g) and side (b, d, f,
and h) views of various states of the egfr-erbb2
heterodimerization process, modeled as described in the experimental procedures. egfr
and erbb2 extracellular domains are shown in
surface representation, with egfr and erbb2 domains i in green, ii in blue, iii in purple, and iv in
gray. egfr is always on the left of the panel, and
erbb2 on the right. egf, when present, is shown
as an orange surface, while  xxxd2890xxx  (g and
h) is shown as a pink surface. the lipid bilayer is
represented as tan spheres, with the modeled
transmembrane helices as black tubes. the dimerization of the intracellular kinase domains of
egfr (yellow surface) and erbb2 (dark green surface) is not meant to suggest the orientation of
the actual kinase dimer.
a and b: the closed (ligand-free) form of egfr
is modeled near a molecule of erbb2. in its unliganded form, the extracellular domain of egfr
(or  xxxg722xxx ) is in a conformation which cannot dimerize with another receptor (cho and leahy,
2002; ferguson et al., 2003).
c and d: egfr is now shown in its open, ligandbound state. upon binding a ligand such as egf,
egfr rearranges into a conformation which exposes the dimerization hairpin, shown protruding
from the center of domain ii in light blue.
e and f: egfr and erbb2 are now heterodimerized. the two receptors interact via each
one’s dimerization hairpin, the membrane-proximal portion of domain iv, and (at least in this
model) the transmembrane helices and intracellular kinase domains. erbb2 heterodimers with
egfr,  xxxg722xxx , and  xxxg723xxx  are all expected to look
identical at this level of detail.
g and h:  xxxd2890xxx  has bound to erbb2,
blocking heterodimerization by preventing the
egfr dimerization hairpin from fitting in its binding
pocket on erbb2.

mology with egfr, is expected to be the binding site for the
dimerization hairpin (figures 5a and 6f); therefore, bound  xxxd2890xxx  is modeled to sterically prevent the dimerization hairpin
from reaching its binding pocket (figures 6g–6h). the fact that
 xxxd2890xxx  binding inhibits erbb2 heterodimerization (agus et
al., 2002) can now be interpreted in light of our structure as
experimental evidence supporting this dimerization model.  xxxd2890xxx  fab bound to domain ii would not sterically interfere
with other dimerization contacts, such as those in domain iv
(figure 6f); if the dimerization hairpin could bend out of the
way, a receptor heterodimer could still potentially be formed.
the conformation of this hairpin is nearly identical in all three
erbb2 structures as well as the two egfr homodimer structures
(cho et al., 2003; garrett et al., 2002, 2003; ogiso et al., 2002),
suggesting that the hairpin is quite rigid and that sterically

324

blocking the hairpin binding pocket is in fact sufficient to prevent
erbb2 heterodimerization. our structure shows that the presence of the entire  xxxd2890xxx  antibody is not needed to cause
this steric interference; the fab fragment alone is sufficient, in
agreement with our previous studies (agus et al., 2002).
erbb2 heterodimerization appears to be different
than egfr homodimerization
by binding to erbb2 domain ii,  xxxd2890xxx  occludes a number
of residues which likely contact the other  xxxg682xxx  receptor in the
heterodimer (figure 5a). we questioned which, if any, of these
residues was important for heterodimerization, and in particular
whether mutations in this region have the same deleterious
effects in an erbb2/ xxxg722xxx  heterodimer as they have been shown
to have in an egfr homodimer (ogiso et al., 2002). in egfr,

figure 7. altered conformation of erbb2 domain ii
the two copies of domain ii (residues 188–313) from the egfr dimer structure
are shown as gray tubes. domain ii (residues 195–320) from erbb2, superimposed on the central disulfide-bonded modules as described in the text, is
shown as a blue tube. the last two disulfide-bonded modules from a copy
of erbb2 superimposed on the other egfr monomer are shown as a black
line to indicate the potential steric clash in this region. for clarity in this
figure, the c␣ backbone traces have been heavily smoothed.

residues tyr 246 and arg 285 interact across the dimer interface,
as do tyr 251 and phe 263 (garrett et al., 2002; ogiso et al.,
2002). erbb2 substitutes a leucine (leu 291) for arg 285 in
egfr, breaking the first of these interactions. therefore, the
erbb2 mutations f257a and f269a, neither of which affects
erbb2/ xxxg722xxx  heterodimerization, are analogous to the egfr
double mutants r285s/y251a and r285s/f263a, which completely eliminate egfr homodimerization (ogiso et al., 2002).
other residues in this region of erbb2 can also be mutated to
alanine with no effect on erbb2/ xxxg722xxx  heterodimerization. thus,
our mutagenesis suggests that formation of erbb2 heterodimers
may be less dependent on correct contacts with the dimerization
arm than formation of egfr homodimers.
altered conformation of erbb2 domain ii suggests
a novel heterodimer contact
the conformation of erbb2 is similar to that of activated, dimeric
egfr; however, small but significant differences in the shape
of domain ii may explain the different dimerization properties
of these two receptors. domain ii of the  xxxg682xxx  receptors is rather
like a spine, with rigid “vertebrae” (the disulfide-bonded modules) held in an overall conformation by domains i and iii; these
domains differ in orientation between egfr and erbb2 due to
the lack of an erbb2 ligand (figure 6d). as a result, the n-terminal portion of erbb2 domain ii is farther from the modeled
dimer interface than in egfr, while the c-terminal portion is
closer (figure 7). the last two disulfide-bonded modules of
egfr domain ii do not make significant dimer contacts in either
egfr homodimer structure, with c␣-c␣ distances no less than
10 å (garrett et al., 2002; ogiso et al., 2002). in the modeled
erbb2 heterodimer, this region is now in direct contact with the
other receptor, with a c␣-c␣ distance as low as 4.5 å. his
296 is in this region, and has been placed relatively close to a
conserved aspartate (residue 279 in egfr,  xxxg722xxx , and  xxxg723xxx ;

cancer cell : april 2004

residue 288 in erbb2) in the modeled dimer partner, possibly
explaining the effects of the l295a/h296a mutation on heterodimerization. the structure of this region is essentially the same
in neu as in human erbb2 (cho et al., 2003), and asn 296 in
neu could make the same dimer interactions that his 296 does
in our model. an unresolved issue is that the single mutants,
l295a and h296a, show little or no effect on heterodimerization,
although we suspect that these mutants may have a small deleterious effect which is below the sensitivity limits of our heterodimerization assay. taken together, these structural and mutational data suggest that the c-terminal portion of erbb2 domain
ii is involved in heterodimerization, and that some residues in
this region, in particular leu 295 and his 296, are important for
heterodimerization as well as  xxxd2890xxx  binding.
interestingly, an erbb2 homodimer cannot be modeled in
the same way as the erbb2 heterodimer discussed above. the
last two disulfide-bonded modules of erbb2 domain ii would
be too close to the dimer interface, interpenetrating by more
than 6 å in the region of ser 313 (figure 7). at minimum, resolving
this steric clash would require reorienting the two erbb2 molecules, possibly disrupting interactions involving the dimerization
hairpin or domain iv. this clash may combine with electrostatic
repulsion between erbb2 monomers (garrett et al., 2003) and
loss of interactions with the dimerization hairpin (cho et al.,
2003) to explain why the extracellular domain of erbb2 will not
homodimerize in solution (ferguson et al., 2000); all of these
effects arise from the differences in domain ii which give erbb2
a unique role as a heterodimerization partner.
in conclusion, our present study provides a satisfying structural basis for  xxxd2890xxx ’s effect as a heterodimerization inhibitor. bound  xxxd2890xxx  occludes the pocket on erbb2 that
would accept the dimerization hairpin of a heterodimer partner,
preventing the association of the two receptors and subsequent
growth signaling.  xxxd2890xxx  therefore represents a novel class
of targeted therapeutic agents, those that inhibit erbb2’s function as a coreceptor. the erbb2- xxxd2890xxx  complex suggests
that alternative antibodies, antibody fragments, or peptidomimetics could also function as heterodimerization inhibitors. recently,  xxxd2890xxx  has successfully completed phase i clinical
testing. these studies suggest that the erbb2 heterodimerization inhibitor can be given safely to patients with advanced
malignancies; in addition,  xxxd2890xxx  produced an objective
response in some of these patients, all of whom had failed to
respond to one or more prior treatment programs. ongoing
phase ii proof-of-concept studies will determine whether inhibition of erbb2 heterodimerization warrants further development
in patients whose tumors lack erbb2 gene amplification, but
are instead driven by ligand-activated erbb2.
experimental procedures
cloning and expression
residues 1–624 of the extracellular domain of erbb2 were stably expressed
and secreted in cho cells as previously described (hudziak and ullrich,
1991). conditioned media (100 liter), with an estimated erbb2 concentration
ⵑ15 mg/l, was concentrated to 12 liter and frozen at ⫺70⬚ c for further
processing.  xxxd2890xxx  is built on the same antibody framework as trastuzumab (carter et al., 1992). selection and humanization of the  xxxd2890xxx 
antibody will be described elsewhere (c. adams, d. allison, j. clark, b. fan,
t. breece, c. schmelzer, s. brignoli, k. totpal, g. phillips, l. presta, and
m.x.s., unpublished data). the heavy and light chains of the  xxxd2890xxx 
fab fragment were coexpressed into the periplasm of the 33b6 strain of e.
coli under the control of an alkaline phosphatase promoter, using an expres-

325

a r t i c l e

sion system originally developed for an anti-lfa-1 fab (werther et al., 1996).
cells (1900 g) were harvested from a 10 liter fermentation and frozen at ⫺70⬚
c in ⵑ200 g batches.
protein purification
erbb2 extracellular domain (ecd) was purified by immunoaffinity and gel
filtration chromatography. a trastuzumab affinity column was prepared by
coupling 400 mg trastuzumab (intact mab; genentech, inc.) to 40 g cnbractivated sepharose (pharmacia); the resulting 100 ml column has the capacity to bind at least 200 mg of erbb2 ecd. concentrated erbb2 ecd from
conditioned cho cell medium was applied to the trastuzumab column,
eluted with 10 mm hcl, and immediately neutralized with 1 m tris (ph 8.0).
fractions containing erbb2 ecd were concentrated and passed over a
superdex-200 column (pharmacia) to separate monomeric protein from disulfide-linked aggregates. the purified protein was stored at 4⬚c in pbs ⫹
0.02% sodium azide.
 xxxd2890xxx  fab was also purified by affinity and gel filtration chromatography. briefly, the fab was released from e. coli cells using osmotic
shock by resuspending frozen cells in 0.1 m acetic acid (ph ⵑ3), 25 mm
edta, 1 mm pmsf. impurities were removed from the shockate by batch
binding to deae-sepharose (pharmacia) at 0.5 ml resin per gram of cells. the
processed shockate was then passed over a protein g-sepharose column
(pharmacia) to trap the fab, and the column was then washed with 10 mm
mes (ph 5.5), 10 mm edta. bound fab was subsequently eluted with 0.1
m acetic acid, and the eluate was neutralized with 1 m tris (ph 8.0). the
pooled fab-containing fractions were further purified by superdex-200 gel
filtration. purified  xxxd2890xxx  fab, like purified erbb2 ecd, is very stable
in pbs ⫹ 0.02% sodium azide. early crystallization trials used protein produced by a different method (vajdos et al., 2002); however, the crystals
were identical to those described here.
erbb2- xxxd2890xxx  complex preparation and crystallization
erbb2 (10.5 mg at 3.5 mg/ml) and  xxxd2890xxx  fab (10.1 mg at 1.3 mg/ml)
were mixed (a 33% molar excess of  xxxd2890xxx ) and allowed to incubate
overnight at 4⬚c. the complex was then separated from excess  xxxd2890xxx 
fab by running over a superdex-200 column in pbs. the purified complex
was concentrated to 10 mg/ml and stored for crystallization in 25 mm tris
(ph 8.0), 150 mm nacl, 0.1 mm edta.
the purified erbb2- xxxd2890xxx  complex was mixed 1:1 with well solution (22% peg 3350, 100 mm ammonium formate) and equilibrated by
hanging- or sitting-drop vapor diffusion against the well solution. the ph of
this mother liquor is not well defined, since there is no buffering capacity at
neutral ph except for the residual tris from the protein storage solution;
however, the ph of 100 mm ammonium formate is ⵑ6.5. tetragonal bipyramids appear in a few days and grow to 100–200 micron size in a week.
crystals were removed from their mother liquor and cryostablized in 100
mm ammonium formate, 25% peg 3350, 20% ethylene glycol, then frozen
in liquid nitrogen.
data collection and structure determination
data for the erbb2- xxxd2890xxx  complex were collected at beamline 5.0.1
of the advanced light source (berkeley). highly redundant data were collected to help counteract the generally weak diffraction. data statistics are
shown in table 1. a molecular replacement solution for the erbb2 portion
of the complex was obtained using amore (navaza, 1994), with the structure
of rat erbb2 (cho et al., 2003) as a search model. once both erbb2 molecules
in the asymmetric unit were found, further molecular replacement using the
variable domain of the  xxxd2890xxx  fab (vajdos et al., 2002) identified the
location of the two  xxxd2890xxx  molecules. initial rigid-body refinement of
the various domains of the complex was performed using cnx (accelrys,
inc.) without enforcing the noncrystallographic symmetry. subsequent positional and restrained individual atomic b factor refinement was performed
using cnx and refmac5 (murshudov et al., 1997), with fairly tight ncs
restraints to prevent overrefinement. model statistics are in table 1.
modeling of an erbb2 heterodimer
modeling of an erbb2-containing heterodimer used the egfr homodimer
structure (ogiso et al., 2002) as a starting point, with erbb2 superimposed
onto one of the two egfr molecules. because of the altered global conformation of erbb2 versus egfr, a global superposition of the two molecules

326

is quite poor (c␣ rmsd ⵑ6 å). superposition by domain lowers the c␣
rmsd to 2–3 å depending on the domain, but raises the question of which
superposition to use for the modeling. since nearly all of the dimerization
contacts in egfr lie in domain ii, this is the logical choice for superposition
when making a heterodimer model. further analysis (see discussion and
figure 7) shows that only residues 232–292 of erbb2 (egfr residues 226–
286) should be included in the superposition. these residues superimpose
well, with a c␣ rmsd of 1.3 å (excluding only two residues at the tip of the
dimerization hairpin). domain iv of egfr is disordered or not present in the
dimeric egfr structures (garrett et al., 2002; ogiso et al., 2002), but can
be plausibly inferred by superposition of domains iii and iv from the closed
form of egfr (ferguson et al., 2003) onto domain iii of the dimeric form.
this superposition places the c termini of the modeled extracellular domains
of egfr and erbb2 in close proximity, allowing the modeled transmembrane
helices to associate. transmembrane helices and linker peptides were created de novo, and two copies of the kinase domain of egfr (stamos et al.,
2002) were placed next to each other in an arbitrary orientation, not one of
the previously proposed  xxxg682xxx  kinase dimer models (groenen et al., 1997;
murali et al., 1996).
while there is no structure of  xxxg722xxx  in its ligand-bound, active form,
the inactive forms of egfr and  xxxg722xxx  show a remarkable similarity to one
another, with c␣ rmsds for domains i, iii, and iv of 0.9–1.2 å (and 1.9 å for
domain ii). to a first approximation, therefore, an egfr/erbb2 heterodimer
model will be identical to an  xxxg722xxx /erbb2 heterodimer model, with the
caveat that the heterodimerized conformation of  xxxg722xxx  (or egfr) may not
be the same as that of homodimeric egfr.
erbb2 mutagenesis and cos-7 transfections
all wild-type and erbb2 mutant constructs used in this study were epitopetagged at the n terminus with the herpes simplex virus signal sequence of
gd replacing the endogenous erbb2 signal sequence (schaefer et al., 1999).
mutations were introduced into a 1.5 kb ecor1-xhoi restriction fragment
of erbb2 in pbsks- (stratagene) using the quick-change method following
manufacturer’s recommendations (stratagene). mutants were then subcloned into the ecori-xhoi site of full-length gderbb2 in a prk5 mammalian
expression vector. all mutations were confirmed by automated dna sequencing. cos-7 cells (1 ⫻ 106 cells/10 cm dish) were transfected with 1 ␮g
of prk5.gderbb2 wild-type or prk5.gderbb2 mutant dna with or without
10 ␮g of prk7. xxxg722xxx  dna as described using lipofectamine according to
the manufacturer’s recommendations (invitrogen). twenty-four hours posttransfection, cells were serum starved overnight in 0.1% fetal bovine serum/
dmem at 37⬚c prior to treatment.
 xxxd2890xxx  binding assays
the relative affinity of  xxxd2890xxx  fab for erbb2 or erbb2 mutants was
measured by elisa. cos-7 cells were transfected with 10 ␮g of prk5.gderbb2
or prk5.gderbb2 mutant plasmids. after 24 hr, cells were lysed in 1 ml of
lysis buffer (1% triton x-100, 1% chaps, 25 mm tris [ph 8.0], 150 mm
nacl, 0.5 mm pmsf, 10 u/ml aprotinin, and 10 ␮g/ml leupeptin). lysates
were normalized to 1 ng/ml gderbb2 protein using the purified soluble
extracellular domain of erbb2 as a standard (vajdos et al., 2002) as quantified
by an origen assay using 2 ␮g/ml biotinylated anti-gd antibody 5b6 for
capture and 0.5 ␮g/ml ori-tagged trastuzumab for detection via an origen
analyzer following manufacturer’s instructions (igen).
nunc maxisorp plates (nunc) were coated with 5 ␮g/ml anti-gd tag
capture antibody (3c8) in pbs overnight at 4⬚c, and blocked for two hours
with 5% bovine  xxxg124xxx  (sigma) in pbs. normalized lysates were
added to coated elisa plates and allowed to bind for 2 hr at 4⬚c. plates
were rinsed with pbs/0.1% tween 20, and serial dilutions of purified  xxxd2890xxx  fab were added to the plates in pbs and allowed to bind for 2 hr. plates
were rinsed with pbs/0.1% tween 20, and an anti-human fab-specific hrp
conjugated antibody (biosource) was added at 1/5000 dilution in pbs/1%
bsa/0.1% tween for 1 hr. plates were rinsed 6⫻ with pbs/0.1% tween,
and bound gderbb2 was detected using tmb as a substrate (sigma) and
measured at 490 nm using a plate reader. the ec50 for each mutant was
calculated from the binding curves using a 4 parameter fit function, and
relative affinities were estimated by dividing the ec50 of each mutant by the
ec50 of wild-type gderbb2.

coimmunoprecipitation assays
activation of erbb2 was evaluated by heterodimerization with  xxxg722xxx  upon
heregulin (hrg) stimulation in a coimmunoprecipitation assay (agus et al.,
2002). prior to stimulation, the medium was changed to fresh dmem with
or without 100 nm  xxxd2890xxx  or trastuzumab for 1 hr prior to stimulation
as indicated. cos-7 cells were stimulated for 10 min at room temperature
with 2 nm of recombinant heregulin (hrg␤1177–244), in binding buffer (rpmi
medium, 0.02% bsa, 10 mm hepes [ph 7.2]) or binding buffer alone as
described. transfected cells were lysed in 1 ml rpmi lysis buffer (1% v/v
triton x-100, 1% w/v chaps, 10 mm hepes (ph 7.2), in rpmi medium
containing 0.2 mm pmsf, 10 ␮g/ml leupeptin, 10 u/ml aprotinin, and 1 mm
na3vo4). heterodimers were immunoprecipitated from 500 ␮l of lysate using
rabbit polyclonal anti- xxxg722xxx  antibody (santa cruz) covalently coupled to
agarose (pierce ultralink) at 4⬚c for 2 hr. complexes were washed twice in
lysis buffer and resuspended in sds sample buffer and boiled. samples
were separated on a 4%–12% polyacrylamide gel (novex) and electroblotted
onto nitrocellulose membranes. blots were blocked in 5% bsa/tbst and
probed with either phosphospecific anti-erbb2 antibody (neomarkers), or
an anti-gd epitope monoclonal antibody (5b6) to detect gderbb2 followed
by a peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse secondary antibody (amersham).
to verify and normalize for expression of transfected constructs between
experimental conditions, 50 ␮g of cell lysate was checked by western blotting with anti-gd antibody (5b6) or anti- xxxg722xxx  (ab7, neomarkers) antibody.
anti-mouse hrp-conjugated secondary antibody was used for visualization
by enhanced chemiluminescence (ecl, amersham pharmacia biotech).
