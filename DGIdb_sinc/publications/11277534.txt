abstract‚Äîn-aminoindoline derivatives were prepared and their  xxxg147xxx  inhibitory activities were evaluated in vitro and
compared with those of phenidone and  xxxd2748xxx . compound 4 presents the most eÔ¨Äective  xxxg147xxx  inhibition. # 2001 elsevier science

the peptidoleukotrienes ltc4, ltd4 and lte4 are
potent constrictors of human airways, and it has been
widely assumed that they play an important role in
asthma.1 they are responsible for potent pro-inÔ¨Çammatory and spasmogenic manifestations, and are present in the airways of asthmatic patients at rest and
during an acute crisis. the  xxxg147xxx  enzyme catalyses two
key steps in the lt biosynthetic pathway: the  xxxd208xxx -5-hpete oxidation step followed by the dehydrogenation phase resulting in the formation of  xxxg1346xxx .2
inhibition of  xxxg147xxx  could provide a novel therapy for
human inÔ¨Çammatory diseases such as asthma.
at least four strategies can be considered for  xxxg147xxx 
inhibition: (a) the antioxidant and/or free radical scavenger mechanism; (b) the iron-chelation process; (c)
the inhibition of the  xxxg147xxx  translocation reaction; and (d)

the substrate mimic procedure.3 the aim of this work
was to synthesise new antioxidants as inhibitors of  xxxg147xxx .
 xxxd2343xxx , a diuretic drug used in cardiovascular disease treatment, has antioxidant properties: this drug is
eÔ¨Äective in the inhibition of ldl oxidation and its
major metabolite, 5-hydroxyindapamide, is even more
active.4 this could be due to capto-dative stabilisation
of the radical5 resulting from the abstraction of a
hydrogen radical. molecule 1, like  xxxd2343xxx , presents
an n-aminoindoline skeleton substituted by a carbonyl
group. the non-cyclized analogues of this molecule
possessing a carbonyl (2) or a sulfonyl group (3)
should help evaluate the inÔ¨Çuence of the indoline cycle
opening and may be compared with  xxxd2343xxx  and
also with phenidone, another antioxidant inhibitor of
 xxxg147xxx .6

in order to test the inÔ¨Çuence of an oxygen moiety on
antioxidant properties, diÔ¨Äerent pharmacomodulations
were performed at c5 and led to 4 (r=oh), that could
be considered as an analogue of 5-hydroxyindapamide,
and to 5 (r=och3). compounds 6 and 7,7 with a
chain containing a double bond as does arachidonic
acid, were also tested.
compound 1 was prepared as outlined in scheme 1.
nitrosoindoline 8 was prepared by nitrosation of indoline.8 reduction with lialh4 and acylation of crude
1-aminoindoline with benzoyl chloride9 produced 1.
the reaction of n-methyl-n-phenylhydrazine with benzoyl chloride or benzenesulfonyl chloride led to
compounds 2 and 3, respectively (scheme 2).

the substituted derivatives 4 and 5 were prepared from
the corresponding indoles (scheme 3).
after reduction with sodium cyanoborohydride into the
corresponding indolines,10 nitrosation resulted in 9 and
10. these compounds were reduced with lialh4 to give
1-aminoindolines which were acylated in situ with benzoyl chloride. compound 4 was obtained after hydrogenolysis of 11 in the presence of raney nickel.
carboxylic acid 6 was synthesised as shown in scheme 4.
ethyl hexynoate was coupled under castro‚Äìstephens
conditions with p-iodobenzoic acid by palladium catalysis in the presence of catalytic amounts of copper(i)
iodide to give the aryne 12.11 reduction of the triple
bond with hydrogen over lindlar catalyst12 did not lead
to pure cis oleÔ¨Ån 14, but to a mixture also containing

trans oleÔ¨Ån and the corresponding alkane. in order to
circumvent this diÔ¨Éculty, separation was performed by
hplc13 after transforming the carboxylic function into
mem ester.14 this strategy led to pure cis oleÔ¨Ån 13. the
mem ester was cleaved by tfa and the resulting carboxylic acid 14 was coupled with 1-aminoindoline in the
presence of edci and hobt.15 the carboxylate ester
was hydrolysed by naoh to give compound 6 which
was coupled with n-decylamine under peptidic synthesis
conditions to give amide 7.
the activities of these diÔ¨Äerent compounds were evaluated in vitro and compared with those of phenidone
and  xxxd2748xxx  ( xxxd2748xxx ),16 the latter
being another antioxidant that inhibits  xxxg147xxx . lipoxygenase products synthesised in rbl-1 cells‚Äîa rat
basophilic leukemia cell line‚Äîwere analysed by hplc.
the cells were harvested by centrifugation, washed with
phosphate buÔ¨Äer saline (pbs), ph 7.4, and resuspended
in pbs. cells were stimulated and the reaction was
stopped as previously described.17 the  xxxg147xxx  product
5-hete was quantiÔ¨Åed by hplc separation on a
chromspher c18 column. detection of 5-hete was
carried out by uv absorbance at 130 nm. compound 4
presented interesting activity (table 1) and was submitted to ic50 determination (scheme 5). compound 4
is as active as phenidone, but less potent than  xxxd2748xxx  in
vitro.
the results oÔ¨Äer several conclusions concerning pharmacomodulations. replacement of indoline (1) by a
non-cyclic skeleton (2) does not provide a more active
table 1.

compound, and the presence of a sulfonyl group (3)
instead of its bioisosteric carbonyl group (2) seems to
increase the inhibition of  xxxg147xxx . compound 4 is more
potent than the non-hydroxylated analogue 1: c5 substitution by a hydroxyl enhances  xxxg147xxx  inhibition and
this group seems to be essential as regards enzyme
binding since compound 5, substituted at c5 by a
methoxy group, is less active. the introduction of the cis
hexenoic chain (6) has no inÔ¨Çuence. on the other hand,
amide 7, tested at 1 mm concentration because of low
solubility, could be attractive for further investigations.
in conclusion, the prepared n-aminoindoline derivatives are only moderately potent in inhibiting  xxxg147xxx .
however, further studies in the aminoindoline and benzothiophene series (relative to  xxxd3554xxx  for example18)
are underway taking into account the preliminary and
encouraging results obtained on compounds 4 and 7,
and considering the fact that a sulfonyl group could
induce an increase in activity.
