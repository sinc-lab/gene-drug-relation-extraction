background: hereditary tyrosinaemia type 1 is a rare inherited metabolic
condition, which leads to a fatal multisystemic disease in childhood.
since 1992,  xxxd2735xxx  – a compound developed from work on triketone
herbicides – has become an effective pharmacological treatment by
inhibiting the enzyme  xxxg1071xxx . objectives:
this review examines recent pharmacological and clinical literature on
 xxxd2735xxx , and assesses its impact as a pharmacological treatment for
hereditary tyrosinaemia type 1. methods: english language literature from
medline and embase for  xxxd2735xxx  was searched from 1990 to 2008 for all
papers relevant to the use of  xxxd2735xxx  in hereditary tyrosinaemia type 1.
conclusions:  xxxd2735xxx  can prevent the development of liver disease and
significantly reduce the risk of developing hepatocellular carcinoma;
however, vigorous surveillance for the development of hcc needs to be
continued lifelong.

introduction

hereditary tyrosinaemia type 1 (ht1) is an inborn error of metabolism characterised
by variably elevated plasma tyrosine concentrations and multisystemic disease with
primarily liver dysfunction and a high risk of hepatocellular carcinoma (hcc),
but also renal tubular dysfunction, neurological crises, cardiomyopathy and
hyperinsulinism. the discovery of succinylacetone (sa) excretion in the urine of
patients with this disease in 1977 [1] localised the enzyme defect responsible
to fumarylacetoacetate (faa) hydrolase (fah), the terminal step in tyrosine
catabolism (figure 1). many different mutations have been identified in this gene
on chromosome 15q23-25 [2], but there is no clear correlation between genotype
and clinical phenotype. the disease occurs worldwide with an overall incidence of
1/100 000 [3], although certain parts of the world have higher incidences due to
local founder genetic effects, such as finland (1/63 000) [4] and parts of quebec
where the incidence is as high as 1/2000 [5].
1.1

pathogenesis

reduced activity of fah leads to the accumulation of the upstream metabolites
faa and maleylacetoacetate (maa), which, in turn, are converted to sa (figure 1).
fah is mainly expressed in liver and kidney cells, and the intracellular metabolites faa and maa could be directly responsible for cell damage in these tissues.
in particular, faa has been shown to have damaging effects on many intracellular
processes including endoplasmic reticulum stress signalling [6], cell-cycle arrest and
apoptosis [7,8], mutagenesis and glutathione depletion [9]. abnormal gene expression
within liver cells [10] and reduced antioxidant capacity [11] have been found in

potent inhibitor of the  xxxg121xxx

neurological crises described in patients with ht1 [13,14].

clinical effects

liver disease is the hallmark of this condition, with the
majority of patients developing acute liver failure in infancy
with ascites, a coagulopathy and a markedly abnormal
 xxxg97xxx  (afp) [15]. some patients develop chronic
liver disease with cirrhosis and growth failure that is
occasionally only diagnosed in teenage years. patients
clinically asymptomatic until the development of hcc
have been described [16]. all patients are at a high risk for

developing hcc later in life. kidney involvement typically
manifests as a fanconi-syndrome-like tubulopathy with
hypophosphataemic rickets being the characteristic finding
especially among those patients with a chronic course [3].
neurological involvement typically consists of porphyria-like
crises [14] although peripheral neuropathy has also been
described [17]. hypoglycaemia due to islet cell hyperplasia
and hyperinsulinism [18], and cardiomyopathy [19] are also
recognised manifestations.
1.3

prognosis and treatment before  xxxd2735xxx 

the outcome for patients with ht1 is dependent on age
and mode of presentation [15]. historically, treatment
consisted only of dietary restriction of phenylalanine and
tyrosine. before the advent of  xxxd2735xxx , an international
survey demonstrated a 2-year survival rate of only 29% in
children presenting with acute liver failure before the age of
2 months. this increased to 74% for patients presenting
between 2 and 6 months; however, long-term survival was
uniformly poor, with no children surviving past the age
of 12 years. the causes of death were primarily liver
failure (67%), hcc (17%) and respiratory failure from
neurological crisis (10%). chronically presenting patients
had a more favourable prognosis with 2-year survival of
96% and some longer-term survivors [15]. however, the
availability of paediatric liver transplantation in the 1980s
changed this, providing a metabolic cure for the hepatic
condition, which enabled patients to return to a normal
diet as well as a treatment for localised hcc [20]. prior
to the advent of  xxxd2735xxx , there was no alternative
pharmacological therapy for this condition.
2.

the development of  xxxd2735xxx 

 xxxd2735xxx  (2-[2-nitro-4-trifluoromethylbenzoyl]-1,3-cyclohexanedione; figure 2) was originally developed as a
triketone herbicide following the discovery that members
of this wider family of compounds occurred naturally
in plant oils. they were found to cause bleaching and
prevented competing plant growth around, for example,
the australian bottle-brush plant calistemon spp. [21].
further investigation into its mode of action demonstrated

a novel mechanism of action for this class of herbicides,
namely potent inhibition of  xxxd40xxx 
dioxygenase (hppd), which catalyses the conversion of
4-hydroxyphenyl pyruvate to homogentisate. the bleaching
in plants is explained by homogentisate subsequently
being converted in plants to plastoquinones and eventually
chlorophyll and carotenoids. this mechanism of action
was also confirmed in animal toxicology studies in the
rat [22]. after the discovery that rats exposed to
 xxxd2735xxx  developed clinical features compatible with
tyrosinaemia type ii, such as corneal lesions and a profound
hypertyrosinaemia [23], collaboration between the team
developing  xxxd2735xxx  and lindstedt’s group in gothenburg
led to the hypothesis that the drug – through its
efficient blockage of flux through the tyrosine catabolic
pathway – should reduce the production of the toxic
metabolites faa and maa in patients with ht1. in 1991,
the drug was made available for the treatment of an infant
with acute liver failure secondary to ht1. the predicted
biochemical response occurred almost immediately, with
reduced urinary sa excretion detected after only 12 h at a
dose of 0.05 mg/kg and undetectable excretion at higher
doses. the patient’s clinical condition improved in parallel
and a further four patients were also treated with similar
results in the following few months [24]. the gothenburg
group coordinated an international study of  xxxd2735xxx 
treatment in ht1, which has recruited > 350 patients at the
time of writing this review [25]. the drug is marketed by
swedish orphan international ab as  xxxd2735xxx ® and has
received approval from both the fda in 2002 [26] and the
eu drug agency in 2005 without formal phase ii, iii
and iv clinical trials.
3.

chemistry of  xxxd2735xxx 

the structure of  xxxd2735xxx  is shown in figure 2. it has some
structural similarity to 4-hydroxyphenyl pyruvate, the
substrate for hppd, an alpha-keto acid-dependent non-haem
fe2+ dioxygenase enzyme. the interaction between  xxxd2735xxx 
and hppd was studied in detail by kavana and moran [27],
who demonstrated that  xxxd2735xxx  exists as the enol
tautomer in physiological aqueous solution and that it binds
exclusively to the metal centre of the active ferrous holoenzyme
rather than the ferric form. they propose a three-step
mechanism of binding: first, a reversible binding proximal
to the active-site metal ion, followed by a bidentate association with the fe2+ centre and, finally, an irreversible
deprotonation of the enol although crystallographic and
computational data on  xxxd2735xxx  binding suggests a terdentate
association [28]. studies on rat liver cytosol extract demonstrated effective inhibition of hppd with a median
inhibitory concentration (ic50) of 40 nm with very slow
dissociation of the  xxxd2735xxx –enzyme complex [22], while
the ic50 on purified human enzyme was lower at 5 nm [21],
thus suggesting a higher affinity for human hppd.

pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics

studies with 14c-radiolabelled  xxxd2735xxx  in rat and
mouse showed selective retention in the liver and, to a lesser
extent, the kidneys and lacrimal system [23,29] after oral
dosing. in man, absorption of  xxxd2735xxx  after a single oral
dose is rapid, with peak plasma concentrations reached
within 1 – 2 h [30].  xxxd2735xxx  was found to have a long
half-life in healthy human subjects in the order of 54 h.
excretion occurs equally in urine and faeces. a starting
dose of 1 mg/kg as a single daily dose is recommended:
incomplete biochemical responses occur to doses less than
this but complete abolition of urinary sa excretion has
generally required doses of this order in early studies [24,25].
adjustments to this dose can be made dependent on biochemical findings on follow up. mean plasma  xxxd2735xxx 
concentration in the extended study has been quoted as
35 µmol/l, which is theoretically sufficient to produce a
99.9% inhibition of hppd based on in vitro studies [31]
although the therapeutic range appears quite wide with
some patients achieving complete abolition of urinary sa
excretion only with levels of ≤ 70 µmol/l. the metabolic
effects of  xxxd2735xxx  in vivo are rapid, with urinary sa
excretion disappearing within days of starting treatment.
it remains protein bound in plasma, hence plasma levels,
and  xxxg121xxx  inhibition, take somewhat longer to normalise [31]. there is a profound increase
in plasma tyrosine after administration of  xxxd2735xxx  [30]
necessitating a tyrosine- and phenylalanine-restricted diet in
all patients on long-term treatment.
5.

clinical effects of  xxxd2735xxx 

5.1

acute liver failure

following the successful initial experimental use of  xxxd2735xxx 
in patients presenting with fulminant liver failure, further
experience suggests a 90% clinical response rate with
improved liver function and coagulopathy within 1 week of
starting treatment [25,32]. in the 10% who do not respond
to  xxxd2735xxx  even in higher doses, liver transplantation
is indicated [20,33].
5.2

chronic liver disease

children who present acutely and are rescued by
 xxxd2735xxx , as well as those who have a chronic presentation,
have established nodular cirrhosis and chronic liver
disease. that the progression of this can be slowed by
 xxxd2735xxx  is evident from studies on animal models of
tyrosinaemia, such as the fah-/- mouse;  xxxd2735xxx 
treatment prevents these mice from lethal liver dysfunction
in the neonatal period and, when discontinued, the
architecture of the liver was increasingly abnormal depending on the length of discontinuation of treatment [34].
in ht1 patients, there is evidence of improvement in
growth, liver function and portal hypertension in children
1232

who have chronic liver disease, and even radiological
regression of liver nodules [35]; however, in other children,
nodules can still get worse despite  xxxd2735xxx . nowadays,
liver transplantation is only indicated for patients with
acute liver failure unresponsive to  xxxd2735xxx  and patients
suspected to have developed hcc, and this is reflected
in the reduced number of liver transplants performed
for ht1 since the introduction of  xxxd2735xxx  (figure 3) [33,36].
hopes that  xxxd2735xxx  would entirely abolish the need
for liver transplantation have not been fulfilled and it is
still important to remember that  xxxd2735xxx  treatment
requires strict adherence to a phenylalanine- and tyrosinerestricted diet (whereas the diet can be relaxed after
liver transplantation).
5.3

hepatocellular carcinoma

the development of hcc remains the most important
complication of ht1 and the effect of  xxxd2735xxx  therapy on
a patient’s risk of developing this is not entirely clear.
intuitively, the earlier  xxxd2735xxx  is commenced, the less
likely a patient should be to develop hcc as the cumulative
exposure of the liver to the mutagenic effects of faa
would be reduced. however, it is possible that malignant
transformation at the microscopic level has already occurred
by the time  xxxd2735xxx  is started. this is borne out by
the early experience of the international  xxxd2735xxx  study.
in children who commenced  xxxd2735xxx  before the age of
12 months, 1 child already had hcc before commencing
treatment [37] and only 1 other child developed hcc after
treatment although doubts have been expressed as to the
precise diagnosis of this tumour given its unusual presentation [33]. between the ages of 12 and 24 months, 2 children
had established hcc before  xxxd2735xxx  treatment and 1 child
has developed late hcc after 11 years of treatment [33].
this compares favourably with the incidence of hcc in
children before the use of  xxxd2735xxx , which is quoted at
18 – 37% based on 2 studies all examining children who
have survived past their second birthday [15,38]. the incidence
of hcc is much greater in children who commence
 xxxd2735xxx  after the age of 2 years and liver transplantation
for proven or suspected hcc has occurred in ≤ 25% of
such patients [25,33,39].
despite reducing the production of toxic metabolites,
 xxxd2735xxx  has been shown not to completely alter abnormal
patterns of gene expression in the liver [10] nor collagen
metabolism [28] and, therefore, the theoretical potential for
carcinogenesis remains. therefore, the follow up of children
on  xxxd2735xxx  must include life-long screening for malignant
change in the liver. current practice in our department is
to screen radiologically with abdominal ultrasound every
3 months and annually with magnetic resonance imaging.
assessment of total afp has been the mainstay of biochemical screening for malignancy for a long time. the afp
is characteristically grossly elevated in patients with ht1
at diagnosis (> 100,000 ng/ml) and, after a variable initial

increase reflecting active liver regeneration, follows an
exponential decline to approximately normal levels after
12 months of  xxxd2735xxx  treatment [25]. any variation from
this pattern can be suggestive of developing malignancy,
including a secondary rise in afp, a slower-than-expected
decline or a lack of return to normal levels [40]. this would
then trigger detailed investigation for malignancy and, if
persistent, liver transplantation. an additional discriminatory
feature receiving further evaluation is the lectin-reactive afp
isoform, which may be more specific for hcc and was
recently shown to increase before the total afp in 50% of
patients with proven hcc [41-43].
5.4

renal tubular dysfunction

renal tubular function improves to some extent in many
children with dietary control alone; however, it is clear that
 xxxd2735xxx  has an additional beneficial effect, presumably
by abolishing renal sa production [44]. in the authors’
experience, renal tubular function normalises within
12 months of commencing treatment and no child has
developed nephrocalcinosis since receiving  xxxd2735xxx  which
compares favourably with an incidence of up to 33% in
non-treated children (personal observation, s santra).

5.5

cardiomyopathy

cardiomyopathy, usually taking the form of septal
hypertrophy, occurs in ≤ 30% of children with ht1 at
diagnosis but is frequently subclinical. children treated
with  xxxd2735xxx  are less likely to develop cardiomyopathy
and, in most cases, it resolves spontaneously whether
 xxxd2735xxx  is used or not [19]. clinically severe cases of
obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy have been shown
to respond to  xxxd2735xxx  [45].
5.6

neurological disease

due to the inhibition of  xxxg121xxx 
by sa, porphyria-like crises have not been reported following
 xxxd2735xxx  treatment because of the complete inhibition of
sa excretion. where neurological symptoms have been the
presenting feature of ht1, immediate improvement is seen
following the use of  xxxd2735xxx  [17]. such crises previously
accounted for ≤ 10% of the mortality from ht1, mainly
from respiratory failure. a recently emerging issue in the use
of  xxxd2735xxx  is the appreciation of significant cognitive
problems in some children with tyrosinaemia type 1 on
treatment, such as recently described in a french cohort [46].
whether this is due to the drug, raised tyrosine levels or

expert opin. pharmacother. (2008) 9(7)

1233

 xxxd2735xxx 

simply due to the disease is not clear, but additional follow up
is necessary to investigate this further.
5.7

palliative care

although it is clear that the earlier  xxxd2735xxx  is used the
better, case reports have shown symptomatic improvement even
in advanced disease where the use of  xxxd2735xxx  is effectively
palliative and transplantation is not an option [47].

adverse effects

the chief toxicological effect of  xxxd2735xxx  from early animal
experiments was the observation that rats treated with
 xxxd2735xxx  developed corneal lesions. this occurred in
parallel with a profound hypertyrosinaemia with plasma
tyrosine levels > 2000 nmol/ml, which concentrated to
≤ 4000 nmol/ml in the aqueous humour of the eye [23].
while hypertyrosinaemia is the likely cause for these
deposits and can be prevented by the restriction of tyrosine
in the diet, other mechanisms may be important [48]. there
are also significant species’ differences in the presence of
corneal lesions [49], hence the significance to humans is not
clear. corneal opacities due to hypertyrosinaemia are a feature
of hereditary tyrosinaemia type 2 ( xxxg2250xxx 
deficiency), but not characteristic of untreated ht1. all
patients taking  xxxd2735xxx  are required to adhere to a
phenylalanine- and tyrosine-restricted diet to minimise the
tyrosinaemia produced by the compound. transient ocular
symptoms – such as irritation, corneal clouding and erosion
and photophobia – have been reported in 13 patients in total
and opacities have been documented in 1 patient poorly
compliant with the diet [50]; however, a longitudinal study
in the authors’ department demonstrated no development of
these opacities despite high plasma tyrosine concentrations
in some cases and the authors do not feel that regular
ophthalmological screening for these in asymptomatic
patients is justified [51]. transient thrombocytopenia and
leucopenia have been reported but this has rarely necessitated
discontinuation of therapy [25]. recent concerns about
cognitive performance have also been raised in children on
 xxxd2735xxx , although whether this is an adverse effect of the
drug itself has yet to be elucidated [46].
7.

expert opinion and conclusion

the outlook for children with ht1 has been transformed
by the advent of  xxxd2735xxx . the compound has gone from
being a toxicological curiosity into an established treatment,
which has demonstrated both efficacy and tolerability
and has now taken its place as the first line in management
for this condition. liver transplantation, previously
unavoidable – the only question being when, rather than if,
to transplant – is now indicated only for the minority of
patients who do not respond to  xxxd2735xxx  and for those in
whom there is concern about the development of hcc.
1234

it appears that this most-feared complication of ht1 may
remain a possibility even in those treated with the drug,
but published evidence shows that the earlier the drug is
started, the more likely it is to prevent hcc developing.
therefore, this fact would strongly support the development
of a neonatal screening programme for the condition
as is already practiced in areas with a higher than average
incidence, such as in some parts of continental europe as
well as in quebec where affected infants can be started
on  xxxd2735xxx  within weeks of birth [52]. there is recent
evidence that relying on tyrosine concentrations alone would
be insufficient to detect all infants and assaying blood spot
sa improves detection [53]. a move to using tandem mass
spectroscopy for neonatal screening could potentially afford
this at relatively low additional cost [54]. there remain a few
areas of uncertainty regarding the use of  xxxd2735xxx , namely
the optimal dose for treatment and preparation. a starting
dose of 1 mg/kg is recommended, although this dose has
been increased or decreased based on biochemical follow up
in some patients. there are certainly published cases
where doses > 1 mg/kg have shown increased efficacy [35].
 xxxd2735xxx  is currently used only as the capsule form
although pharmacokinetic studies in man have shown
equivalence between this and a solution form that would
make dosing for infants and children easier [30]. another
area of uncertainty remains in the use of  xxxd2735xxx  after
liver transplantation. there are reports of residual urinary
sa excretion after liver transplantation and, in some patients,
even appreciable plasma levels [55]. this presumably comes
from the original kidneys. there is some debate as to
whether the use of  xxxd2735xxx  post-transplant is indicated in
this situation to minimise a possible and persistent hcc
risk. sa is only one of a number of unstable intermediates
that causes immediate and localised toxic effects in a
fah-deficient liver. it is clearly worrying to see persistent sa
excretion in liver-transplanted patients; however, the authors
feel the pathophysiology of the toxic insult to the transplanted liver from kidney-derived sa differs to the one
before transplantation from within the native liver. to date,
there has not been a published case of hcc developing in
a transplanted liver and the authors feel uneasy to restart
 xxxd2735xxx , as well as a strict diet, for what remains a
theoretical risk at present. however, further investigations
on this dilemma in the future may clarify this issue. there
are studies ongoing to investigate the potential for fah
gene replacement as a cure for ht1 to obviate the need for
 xxxd2735xxx  and transplantation. although animal studies are
encouraging in the effect on acute liver failure, there remains
concern for ongoing toxic metabolite production from
non-transfected patches of liver and integration-related
genotoxicity, which would theoretically increase the risk of
hcc. hcc was still seen in the majority of transfected
animals although interestingly it was found to arise in patches
of liver that had escaped transfection [56]. these concerns
and the requirement, therefore, for 100% hepatocyte

transfection to prevent hcc and to prevent toxic metabolite
production make gene therapy for human ht1 a very
distant prospect indeed and  xxxd2735xxx  is likely to remain
the mainstay of treatment for the foreseeable future.
while this review has concentrated on the use of
 xxxd2735xxx  for ht1, the compound has been proposed as
a potential treatment for the less-severe but potentially
debilitating condition alkaptonuria, which is caused by a
deficiency in homogentisate 1,2-dioxygenase [57]. by reducing
the production of homogentisic acid,  xxxd2735xxx  could
