summary: abrupt withdrawal of b-adrenoceptor antago-
nists may lead to “rebound effects.” to investigate the po-
sition of the new nonselective b-adrenoceptor antagonist
 xxxd356xxx  [with moderate intrinsic sympathomimetic activ-
ity (isa)], this drug was compared with propranolol (no
isa),  xxxd123xxx  (weak isa), and  xxxd2957xxx  (marked isa).
the effects on lymphocyte ,-adrenoceptor den-
sity—assessed by (+}[!*-ijiodocyanopindolol (icyp) bind-
ing—were investigated in healthy volunteers aged 23-35
years. none of the test drugs changed the affinity of icyp
for 8, adrenoceptors. propranolol treatment (4 x 40 mg/day)
increased the density of b,-adrenoceptors by 25% after 2
days; during treatment b,-adrenoceptor density remained
elevated. after withdrawal of propranolol, b,-adrenoceptor
density declined slowly, being still significantly increased after
3 days, although propranolol was not detectable in plasma
after 24 h, though heart rate was significantly increased. al-
 xxxd240xxx  treatment (4 x 100 mg/day) did not significantly af-
fect ,-adrenoceptor density.  xxxd2957xxx  treatment (2 x 5
mg/day) caused a 50% decrease of 8,-adrenoceptor density

after 2 days, which remained reduced during treatment. after
withdrawal, 8,-adrenoceptor density was still significantly
diminished after 4 days. during and after treatment heart
rate was not affected.  xxxd356xxx  treatment (2 mg/day)
caused a 40% decrease of f,-adrenoceptor density after 2
days, which remained reduced during treatment. after
withdrawal, ®>-adrenoceptor density was still significantly
diminished after 4 days. during and after treatment heart
rate was not affected. it is concluded that the isa may play
an important role in modulating 8,-adrenoceptor density and
hence tissue responsiveness to b-adrenoceptor stimulation.
propranolol (no isa) caused increases in b,-adrenoceptor
density which persisted after withdrawal, which might ex-
plain the “propranolol rebound effect.” since b-adrenocep-
tor antagonists with isa did not increase, but rather de-
creased b,-adrenoceptor density, such rebound effects may
not occur after abrupt cessation of drug treatment. key
words: @—adrenoceptor antagonists — lymphocyte ,-ad-
renoceptors — withdrawal syndrome — drug treatment.

 

 

there are several reports that abrupt withdrawal of
certain b-adrenoceptor antagonists may result in clin-
ical syndromes suggesting adrenergic hypersensitivity
(1). on the contrary, rebound effects have not been
observed after abrupt withdrawal of  xxxd2957xxx , a 6-ad-
renoceptor antagonist with intrinsic sympathomimetic
activity (isa) (2).

by radioligand binding studies (3) it was demon-
strated that chronic treatment with propranolol leads
to a significant increase of b,-adrenoceptor density in
circulating lymphocytes. on the other hand, therapy
with  xxxd2957xxx  decreased f,-adrenoceptor density in
lymphocytes by about 50% (4,5), which may be very
likely related to the isa of the drug. thus, isa may
play an important role in the b-adrenoceptor antago-
nist-induced modulation of 6-adrenoceptor density.

 

to test this hypothesis, the effects of the nonselec-
tive b-adrenoceptor antagonists  xxxd2957xxx  (strong isa),
 xxxd123xxx  (weak isa), and propranolol (no isa) on
f>-adrenoceptor density in lymphocytes (6) were com-
pared against the new nonselective b-adrenoceptor
antagonist  xxxd356xxx  (relatively strong isa) in healthy
young volunteers.

methods

twenty-five healthy normotensive volunteers (18 male,
mean age 26.1 + 1.2 (20-35) years) participated in the study
after having given informed written consent. all were drug-
free and had undergone physical examination to exclude
asthma, chronic pulmonary disease, diabetes mellitus, hy-
pertension, cardiac disease, and symptoms referable to the
cardiovascular system. the experimental protocol is given in

heparin blood (500 iu heparin/10 ml blood) was withdrawn
with the subjects seated.

thereafter subjects were divided in four groups: in the first
group (n = 6) propranolol (4 x 40 mg/day at 0600, 1200,
1800 and 2400 h), in the second group (n = 6)  xxxd123xxx  (4
x 100 mg/day at 0600, 1200, 1800, and 2400 h), in the third
group (n = 8)  xxxd2957xxx  (2 x 5 mg at 0700 and 1900 h), and
in the fourth group (n = 5)  xxxd356xxx  (1 x 2 mg at 1900
h) was self-administered orally. at certain time intervals
(indicated by the arrows in fig. 1) during treatment and on
4 successive days after the withdrawal of the drugs, blood
samples were collected; in addition, 5 ml edta blood for
determination of plasma levels of the b-adrenoceptor antag-
onists was taken.

lymphocytes were isolated from heparinized blood by the
method of b6yum (7), washed three times with phosphate-
buffered saline (pbs), and finally resuspended in 10 mmol/l
tris-hcl, 154 mmol/l nacl buffer, ph 7.2, containing 0.55
mmol/l  xxxd228xxx . for determination of f,-adrenocep-
tor density, lymphocytes (0.5-1.3 x 10° cells/tube) were in-
cubated with 6 concentrations of icyp ranging from 10 to
200 pmol/l at 37°c for 60 min in a total volume of 250 yl.
incubation was terminated by diluting the enitre reaction
mixture with 10 ml 10 mmol/l tris-hcl, 154 mmol/l nacl
buffer, ph 7.4, followed by rapid filtration over watman
gfic filters. each filter was washed with an additional 10
ml of buffer. the radioactivity of the wet filters was deter-
mined in a gamma counter (beckman gamma 4000) at an
efficiency of about 75%. ‘nonspecific’ binding of icyp was
defined as radioactivity bound, which is not displaced by a
high concentration of (—)-propranolol (1 pmol/l). ‘specific
binding’ of icyp was defined as total binding minus non-
specific binding; it usually amounted to 70% at 20 pmol/l
of icyp.

the experimental data given in the text and figures are
means + sem of n experiments. the maximal number of
icyp binding sites and the equilibrium dissociation constant
(k,) were calculated from plots according to scatchard (8).
the significance of differences was estimated by student's 7
test. a p value smaller than 0.05 was considered to be
significant.

results

lymphocyte 8,-adrenoceptor density was increased
after 2 days of propranolol treatment by about 25%

(fig. 2) and remained elevated during the treatment
period. after cessation of propranolol therapy, ()-ad-
renoceptor density declined slowly, being still signifi-
cantly increased after 3 days. the affinity of icyp to
lymphocyte b,-adrenoceptors, however, did not change
during or after propranolol treatment (9). whereas
propranolol had only a moderate effect on blood pres-
sure in these normotensive subjects, it significantly de-
creased heart rate by about 10 beats/min; after ces-
sation of propranolol treatment, heart rate increased
rapidly and reached values significantly higher than
predrug levels (fig. 2).

 xxxd123xxx  did not significantly influence b,-adren-
oceptor density, heart rate, or blood pressure (fig. 3).
the two isa f-adrenoceptor blocking drugs  xxxd2957xxx 
and  xxxd356xxx , however, caused an about 50% (pin-
dolol) or 40% ( xxxd356xxx ) decrease of b,-adrenocep-
tor density (figs. 4, 5); during treatment the f,-ad-
renoceptor density remained at these reduced levels.
after withdrawal, 8,-adrenoceptor density was dimin-
ished for more than 4 days. the kp values of icyp,
however, were not affected. the two drugs had no ef-
fect on heart rate or blood pressure, either during
treatment or after withdrawal (figs. 4, 5).

discussion

the properties of 8,-adrenoceptors in human lym-
phocytes—as evaluated by icyp binding (6) — resem-
ble very closely those in other tissues (10), including
human heart (11). aarons et al. (3) and molinoff and
aarons (4) have shown that in rats changes of the

density of 6-adrenoceptors in lymphocytes reflect b-
adrenoceptor alterations that occur in solid tissues like
heart or lung. changes in human lymphocyte f,-ad-
renoceptors might therefore be taken as representa-
tive for changes of g-adrenoceptors in other tissues.
accordingly, the propranolol-induced increase by
about 25% in the present study may imply increased
responsiveness of b-adrenoceptor stimulation. such

increased responsiveness, which persists after with-
drawal of propranolol, leading to a significantly in-
creased heart rate, might be the cause of the “pro-
 xxxd3033xxx  withdrawal phenomenon” (1).

in contrast to propranolol, the b-adrenoceptor an-
tagonists with isa did not increase but rather de-
creased ,-adrenoceptor density. the magnitude of this
b-adrenoceptor antagonist-induced decrease in f-ad-
renoceptor density seems to be correlated with the in-
tensity of the isa, since  xxxd2957xxx  and  xxxd356xxx  with
moderate isa reduced f-adrenoceptor density by 50%
and 40%, respectively, whereas  xxxd123xxx  with very
weak isa (9) had no effect. °

in the  xxxd356xxx  group we also observed a de-
crease in  xxxd2398xxx -evoked increases in the intra-
cellular levels of  xxxd1773xxx  (an index for functional
responsiveness of lymphocyte ,-adrenoceptors; re-
sults not shown). thus rebound effects may not occur
after abrupt withdrawal of  xxxd356xxx  and  xxxd2957xxx . in
fact,  xxxd2957xxx  does not show any adrenergic hypersen-
sitivity syndrome after abrupt discontinuation of treat-
ment (2).

in conclusion, the isa of b-adrenoceptor antago-
nists may play an important role in modulating -ad-
renoceptor density and, by this, tissue responsiveness
to b-adrenoceptor stimulation. 6-adrenoceptor an-
tagonists without isa lead to increases in b-adreno-
ceptor density and responsiveness, which may explain
the “rebound effects” after abrupt withdrawal. since
f-adrenoceptor antagonists with isa do not increase
(but rather decrease) 8-adrenoceptor density, such re-
bound effects may be less likely to occur after discon-
tinuation of treatment.
