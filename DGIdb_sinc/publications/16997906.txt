racemase structural family by phylogenetic studies

 xxxg232xxx  (adc) and  xxxg1626xxx  (odc) are involved in the biosynthesis of putrescine, which is
the precursor of other polyamines in animals, plants, and bacteria. these pyridoxal-5#-phosphate–dependent decarboxylases belong to the alanine racemase (ar) structural family together with diaminopimelate decarboxylase (dapdc),
which catalyzes the final step of lysine biosynthesis in bacteria. we have constructed a multiple-sequence alignment
of decarboxylases in the ar structural family and, based on the alignment, inferred phylogenetic trees. the phylogenetic
tree consists of 3 distinct clades formed by adc, dapdc, and odc that diverged from an ancestral decarboxylase. the
ancestral decarboxylase probably was able to recognize several substrates, and in archaea and bacteria, odc may have
retained the ability to bind other amino acids. previously, a paralogue of odc has been proposed to account for adc
activity detected in mammalian cells. according to our results, this appears unlikely, emphasizing the need for more
caution in functional assignment made using sequence data and illustrating the continuing value of phylogenetic analysis
in clarifying relationships and putative functions.

pyridoxal-5#-phosphate (plp)–dependent enzymes
are a large group of proteins that are mostly involved in
amino acid metabolism. their diverse reaction specificities,
including a decarboxylation, b and c elimination and replacement reactions, transamination, racemization, as well
as aldol cleavage, have evolved before their substrate specificities (alexander et al. 1994). the plp-dependent enzymes
can be divided into 5 families based on sequence similarity
(grishin et al. 1995) and structural comparisons (jansonius
1998). the 5 families are not homologues of each other, but
surprisingly the different folds form a structurally similar
plp-binding core, where phosphate is bound in a similar
way whereas the pyridoxal ring is not (denessiouk et al.
1999; denesyuk et al. 2003). jansonius (1998) named the
families after the first enzyme whose 3-dimensional structure had been determined in each family: the aspartate aminotransferase family, the d-amino acid transferase family,
the glycogen phosphorylase family, the tryptophan synthase
b family, and the alanine racemase (ar) family. in addition
to alanine racemase, the ar family contains prokaryotic ar,
prokaryotic biosynthetic  xxxg232xxx  (adc), diaminopimelate decarboxylase (dapdc), and eukaryotic  xxxg1626xxx  (odc). adc, dapdc, and odc have
low sequence identity, only 20–30%, but the sequence similarity between the decarboxylases and ar is very low.
the crystal structures of ars (shaw et al. 1997; fenn
et al. 2003), dapdcs (ray et al. 2002; gokulan et al. 2003),
and odcs (kern et al. 1999; almrud et al. 2000; jackson
et al. 2003) with different ligands have been solved, but
no experimentally determined structure of an adc has been
reported to date. ar, dapdc, and odc are dimeric proteins
where each monomer consists of 2 domains, the n-terminal a/
b-barrel domain binding plp and the c-terminal b-sandwich
domain, which are slightly rotated in respect to each other in
the different enzymes (shaw et al. 1997; kern et al. 1999; ray

et al. 2002). the 2 active sites, where plp is bound, are formed
by residues from both the n-terminal domain and the cterminal domain of the different monomers of the decarboxylases. compared with dapdcs and odcs, the adc
sequences contain an insertion of approximately 85 amino
acids that is thought to form an additional domain, introduced
between the n- and c-terminal domains (jantaro et al. 2006).
the reaction mechanism of odc has been studied most,
but the enzymatic mechanism of adc, dapdc, and odc is
assumed to be similar (brooks and phillips 1997; jackson
et al. 2000). the reaction begins when the plp-binding
lys69 (numbering according to human odc) is displaced
by  xxxd2793xxx , which is then decarboxylated. plp functions
as an electron sink to stabilize the decarboxylated substrate.
the protonation of the decarboxylated substrate is controlled
by cys360 that rotates into the active site (jackson et al.
2000). the release of the product is the rate-limiting step in
the reaction (brooks and phillips 1997).
adc and odc catalyze reactions in alternative pathways of putrescine biosynthesis. putrescine is the precursor
of aliphatic polyamines, which are involved in growth and
developmental processes of many organisms. in animals,
there is only 1 pathway for putrescine biosynthesis: the
direct synthesis of putrescine from  xxxd2793xxx  by odc
(coleman et al. 2004). in some species, odc activity is regulated by an antizyme that binds to odc and targets it for
degradation (murakami et al. 1992). in addition to odc,
to date 2 other types of  xxxg232xxx  sequences have
been found in mammals—one is an antizyme inhibitor
(azi) (murakami et al. 1996) and the other an odc paralogue ( xxxg232xxx ) that has been proposed to be either an
azi or an adc (pitkänen et al. 2001; zhu et al. 2004). in
plants and bacteria, there is an additional pathway leading
to the synthesis of putrescine, where l-arginine is first decarboxylated to  xxxd94xxx  by adc. in plants,  xxxd94xxx  is then
modified in a 2-step process to putrescine, but in bacteria,  xxxd94xxx  is directly converted to putrescine. the plant adc is
located mainly in chloroplasts and has been suggested to be of
cyanobacterial origin, whereas the plant, fungal, and animal
odcs are found mainly in the cytoplasm and probably
originate from other forms of bacteria (borrell et al. 1995;
illingworth et al. 2003; bortolotti et al. 2004).
dapdc is expressed in bacteria and in plants, where it
catalyzes the final step in lysine biosynthesis (velasco et al.

methods
sequence data
the sequences of adc, azi, dapdc, odc, and  xxxg232xxx ,
ranging from ;400 to ;700 amino acid residues, were
obtained from the uniprot knowledgebase (bairoch et al.
2005). in order to identify potential decarboxylase sequences
that are not yet identified by uniprot, we performed searches
of sequences obtained from bacterial and archaeal genome
projects using the human odc protein sequence as the query
and the genomic version of blast (cummings et al. 2002)
provided by national center for biotechnology information
(http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast/). additional searches
using blast and the dapdc sequence of escherichia coli as
the query sequence identified putative dapdc sequences
from 2 plants, arabidopsis thaliana and oryza sativa. all sequences analyzed in this study are listed in supplementary
table 1, supplementary material online. herein, the name
of each sequence consists of 2 parts: the first part identifies
the protein (adc, azi 5 azin, dapdc 5 dcda, odc,
and  xxxg232xxx ), and the second part identifies the organism according to codes used by uniprot (bairoch et al. 2005; http://
www.ebi.uniprot.org/support/documents.shtml). in those
cases where sequences were not available from uniprot,
the second part of the sequence name consists of the first 3
letters of the genus followed by the first 2 letters of the species.
the odc sequence from leishmania donovani contains a large n-terminal extension not present in the odc
sequences from other organisms (hanson et al. 1992). this
200-residue long extension was removed from the l. donovani sequence, and only residues 201–707 were used in the
analysis.

with the azi and  xxxg232xxx  sequences), and the adc sequences.
finally, the 3 separate alignments were combined into 1 multiple-sequence alignment of 130 sequences (see supplementary material online) in the alignment editor of bodil
(lehtonen et al. 2004).
several programs in the phylip package (version
3.65; felsenstein 1989) were used to reconstruct phylogenies. the jones–taylor–thornton model implemented in
protdist was used to calculate a distance matrix for
the multiple-sequence alignment. in order to evaluate the
confidence of the inferred tree, a bootstrap set of 1,000
pseudoalignments was generated by seqboot. thereafter, distance matrices for each pseudoalignment were calculated with protdist. the program neighbor was
used to compute a neighbor-joining (nj) tree from each
distance matrix, and finally a consensus tree was computed
with consense. in order to combine the topology of the
consensus tree with the distances from the original matrix,
the program fitch was used. finally, a picture of the
inferred tree was generated with the programs drawgram and drawtree. a maximum likelihood (ml)
method for phylogeny estimation, proml, was also used,
again with a bootstrap set of 1,000 pseudoalignments, and
the consensus tree was computed with consense.
modeling
structural models of human azi and  xxxg232xxx  were made
with modeller 8.1 (sali and blundell 1993) based on
the multiple-sequence alignment, and the human odc crystal structure was used as the structural template (protein data
bank code 1d7k; almrud et al. 2000). after visual examination, the model with the lowest objective function derived
by modeller was chosen for further study in each case.
the quality of each model was evaluated with prosaii
(sippl 1993).
visualization
the bodil modeling environment was used for the visualization and superimposition of crystal structures (lehtonen et al. 2004). figures 1–4 and supplementary figures
1–3, supplementary material online were finalized using
gimp 2.2 and inkscape 0.43. figures 5a and 6 were produced with pymol (version 0.99, delano 2002), and the
labels were added with gimp 2.2. the figure containing
the multiple-sequence alignment (supplementary material
online) was produced using alscript version 2.0 (barton
1993). due to limitations of space, some trees are not reported in the text or supplementary material online, but
they can be obtained by contacting the authors.
results and discussion

phylogeny reconstruction
automatic multiple-sequence alignments were performed with malign (johnson and overington 1993;
johnson et al. 1996). due to the putative inserted domain
present in adcs, a previously published alignment of 2 adc,
2 dapdc, and 2 odc sequences (jantaro et al. 2006) was
used as the initial alignment in this study. the initial alignment was separately aligned with the dapdc, odc (together

we have collected sequences of amino acid decarboxylases from the ar structural family representing all levels
of the tree of life, which includes 33 adc, 47 dapdc, 32
odc, 2 azi, and 3  xxxg232xxx  sequences. in addition, 10 bacterial sequences and 3 archaeal sequences, which are clearly
homologous to odc according to the blast searches, were
included in the study, even though they had not yet been
annotated (supplementary table 1, supplementary material

downloaded from http://mbe.oxfordjournals.org/ at florida atlantic university on may 22, 2015

2002; hudson et al. 2005). lysine is needed for bacterial
survival, and the dapdc gene, lysa, is essential for bacterial
vitality (pavelka and jacobs 1996). dapdc has previously
been recognized to be evolutionary related to eukaryotic
odcs and prokaryotic biosynthetic adcs (martin et al.
1988; sandmeier et al. 1994). however, the evolutionary
and functional relationships of the 3 decarboxylasesand other
highly similar sequences, like the azis, have not been studied
in detail. we have now collected 130 protein sequences of
amino acid decarboxylases from the ar structural family,
and based on their multiple-sequence alignment, we have inferred phylogenetic trees. in addition, we have constructed
structural models of the human azi and  xxxg232xxx  proteins in
order to compare their plp-binding properties with odc
and to evaluate the suggested adc activity (zhu et al.
2004) of  xxxg232xxx . here, phylogenetic analyses led to a more
detailed understanding of the evolutionary relationships between the enzymes and assisted in the classification of newly
identified decarboxylases whose functions were uncertain.

online). we decided to limit the total number of sequences
in the study to 130 in order to avoid redundancies in the
trees caused by having very similar sequences from closely
related species. the program hmmer (http://www.wustl.
edu/) and 2 hmmer profiles constructed from the original
alignment of the 130 decarboxylase sequences identified
;1,000 hits from genbank (release153, benson et al.

2006) each with e values between 7 3 10 242 and 10. in
each case, these 130 sequences distribute quite evenly among
the 1,000 hmmer hits, and we can thus conclude that our set
of 130 sequences represents well the decarboxylases and
that the set includes both closely and more distantly related
enzymes. the bootstrap method of felsenstein (1985) was
used to evaluate the confidence of the reconstructed trees;

82 kidron et al.

bootstrap values between 70% and 100% have been suggested to indicate significant support for a branch (soltis
de and soltis ps 2003).
the sequence alignment with 130 sequences (supplementary material online) contains 7 completely conserved
residues: 2 glutamates and 5 glycines. one of the glutamates
(glu94, human odc numbering) interacts with the plpbinding lysine (lys69) during catalysis, and the other glutamate (glu274) forms a bond with the pyridine nitrogen of
plp (almrud et al. 2000). three of the 5 conserved glycines form a motif (gly235–gly237) that interacts with
plp, whereas the 2 other conserved glycines (gly171 and
gly387) have structural roles. if the sequences of azi and
 xxxg232xxx  are not considered, then there are 5 additional residues
that are completely conserved in the alignment: the lysine
(lys69) that covalently binds plp, an arginine (arg154) located near plp, another lysine (lys169) that stabilizes a loop
near the active site (jackson et al. 2004), an arginine (arg277)
that binds the phosphate in plp (osterman et al. 1997), and
a cysteine (cys360) that is involved in the catalytic reaction
(jackson et al. 2000). these conserved residues are structurally or functionally important for the enzymes and, together
with the pattern of semiconservative positions distributed
throughout the alignment, indicate that the sequences are
for the most part aligned correctly although there are regions
with subfamily-specific sequence patterns.
general topology of the phylogenetic tree
in this work, we have used 2 different methods for
phylogeny reconstruction: the nj and ml algorithms from
the phylip package, as described in the methods. the 2
methods differ greatly in the way the trees are constructed.
the nj method is based on a distance matrix calculated

topology of the individual branches
the phylogenetic tree computed for the adcs diverges
into 2 distinct branches with bootstrap support of 90% (fig.
2). one branch is composed of the plant adc sequences,

fig. 2.—the consensus tree of adc sequences. the root indicates the
point where the 3 families of decarboxylases diverge from each other, see
figure 1. the branches are scaled according to distance. the percentage of
bootstrap support for each node is indicated in the following way, below

from the sequence alignment. in contrast, no distance matrix
is used in the ml method; instead, the starting point is a random tree, which is modified until the highest likelihood
of producing the original multiple-sequence alignment is
achieved. the same set of 1,000 pseudoalignments, derived
from the multiple-sequence alignment of the 130 amino acid
decarboxylases of the ar structural family, was used to assess the confidence of both methods. the overall topology of
the nj tree is congruent with the topology of the ml tree;
however, within the main branches, there are few minor differences. we will first discuss the topology of the nj tree and
then compare the topological differences between the nj and
ml trees.
the phylogenetic tree of the ar structural family of
amino acid decarboxylases contains 3 main branches (fig.
1). as expected, these 3 main groups are formed by adcs,
dapdcs, and odcs. in figure 1, the branch lengths have
been scaled to indicate the relative evolutionary distance between the decarboxylases. comparison of the distances
among the 3 clades implies that the dapdc and odc are
more similar to each other than either group is to the adc
group. the distance between adcs and dapdcs or odcs
is more than double compared with the distance between
dapdcs and odcs.
members of the adc subfamily contain an inserted domain of ;85 residues, which is found neither in the dapdcs
nor in the odcs. we have previously published an alignment
(jantaro et al. 2006), where the inserted domain of the adcs
aligns as a separate domain. in the current study, that alignment was used as the basis for the multiple-sequence alignment of the 130 sequences as described in the methods. in
order to assess the effect of the inserted domain on the phylogeny reconstruction, we removed the inserted domain from
the adc sequences in the alignment and computed the phylogenetic tree. as expected, the topology of this tree is identical to the tree derived from the whole alignment (data not
shown). in addition, the evolutionary distances are equally
long in both trees. this suggests that the inserted domain does
not affect the evolutionary relationships among the adcs,
dapdcs, and odcs.
in order to evaluate whether the use of the initial alignment (see methods) affected the topology of the tree, we
aligned a subset of sequences using a different method.
first, 44 sequences from the collected set of 130 decarboxylases were randomly chosen and aligned. the alignment
included 14 dapdcs, 14 odcs, 1  xxxg232xxx , and1 azisequence,
together with 14 adc sequences from which the inserted
domain had been removed. a phylogenetic tree was inferred
from the alignment using the nj method. the topology of
the tree and the evolutionary distances (data not shown) are
very similar to the tree depicted in figure 1. there are 3 clearly
distinguishable branches, which are formed by the adcs,
dapdcs, and odcs. thus, we can conclude that in our case,
the use of a previously aligned set of sequences to seed a larger
alignment did not bias the phylogeny reconstruction.

whereas the other branch contains the bacterial adc sequences. the bacterial adcs form 2 branches with 53%
bootstrap support, in which the cyanobacterial adcs
cluster together with bacteroidetes, planctomycetes, and
deinococcus-thermus adcs, whereas the beta- and
gamma-proteobacterial adcs form the other branch.
the dapdc sequences segregate into 4 main branches
(fig. 3), which appear to have diverged over a relatively short
evolutionary time frame. under such a short time frame, the
number of substitutions supporting each node and the data
set as a whole remain small and is particularly sensitive
to random fluctuations in observed mutations and small differences in the mutation rate, which ultimately leads to low
bootstrap values (soltis de and soltis ps 2003). the first
cluster of dapdc sequences is formed by 4 epsilon-proteobacteria, whereas the second branch comprises a clearly
defined cluster of cyanobacteria, firmicutes, and actinobacteria sequences. the third and fourth branches of the dapdc
sequences diverge with low bootstrap support (10%). the
branches consist of the alpha-, beta-, delta-, and gammaproteobacteria dapdcs, together with the aquificae, chlorobi, and thermotogae sequences, and the 2 viridiplantae sequences identified by a blast search against the genomes of
a. thaliana and o. sativa. the bootstrap support, however, is
very low (11%) for the viridiplantae branch. the 5 archaeal

dapdc sequences form 2 branches with relatively low bootstrap values (6–33%). in addition, the distances among the
archaea sequences are very long within the branches. the
dapdc of deinococcus radiodurans, which diverges from
the rest of the dapdc sequences with a bootstrap support
of 99%, lies completely outside the cluster of dapdc sequences. the phylogenetic tree of hudson et al. (2005),
which consists of 33 dapdc sequences but where the significance and robustness of the branching order of the tree
were not evaluated, resembles our tree both in the general
topology and the short internal branch lengths associated
with the earlier diverging members of the dapdc sequences.
with the dapdcs, 1 of the archaea branches is formed
by sequences that were identified in blast searches of the
genomes of methanococcoides burtonii and ferroplasma
acidarmanus. the classification of the m. burtonii and
f. acidarmanus decarboxylases as dapdcs is supported
by the presence of 2 conserved residues, glutamate and tyrosine, which are found in all dapdcs, whereas the corresponding residues in the human odc are aspartate
(asp361) and phenylalanine (phe397). the histidine that
in the known decarboxylase structures stacks with the pyridoxal ring of plp and is conserved across the decarboxylases is, however, not conserved in the m. burtonii and
f. acidarmanus dapdcs, where the corresponding residue

is a methionine, which is also capable of interacting favorably with the ring surface. even if the catalytic and the other
residues that interact with plp are conserved, the histidine
to methionine mutation at the active site raises the question
as to whether the dapdcs of m. burtonii and f. acidarmanus are indeed functional plp-binding decarboxylases. if
the function of histidine is limited to interacting with the
plp ring, as opposed to a direct role in catalysis, then methionine should be able to take on that role with little effect
on catalysis.
the other putative decarboxylase (putative dc) sequences, which were identified in bacteria and archaea by
the blast searches, cluster within the branch containing the
odc sequences (fig. 4). nonetheless, these sequences are
clearly segregated from the eukaryotic odcs with a bootstrap
support of 98%. the odc of selenomonas ruminantium,
which has both lysine and odc activity (takatsuka et al.
2000), is separated from the other prokaryotic odc sequences
and forms a distinct branch together with odc from rhodopirellula baltica. according to the genbank annotation for
the r. baltica odc, the protein is a putative lysine/ornithine
decarboxylase.

the eukaryotic plant, fungal, and animal odc sequences separate into 4 distinct branches (fig. 4). the plant
odcs segregate with a bootstrap value of 57%, and the
branch that includes the arthropod and nematode odcs
segregate with a bootstrap support of 96%. the fungal
branch segregates from the chordates with a bootstrap support of 77%. interestingly, the 2 protist odc sequences do
not cluster together. the odc of l. donovani forms a separate branch, and the odc of trypanosoma brucei segregates from the chordata branch of the odcs, respectively,
with bootstrap support of 99% and 52%. the surprising
similarity of the odc of t. brucei with the chordate odcs
has been noted previously (salzmann et al. 2000). the chordate odcs cluster together into 1 branch except for the
odc2 from xenopus laevis, which forms a branch together
with the  xxxg232xxx  sequences (with 87% bootstrap support).
this suggests that the odc2 of x. laevis may be an  xxxg232xxx ,
which has also been suggested by others (pitkänen et al.
2001). the azi sequences from human and zebra fish segregate from the odcps with a bootstrap value of 83%.
the presence of adc activity in mammalian cells has
been reported (regunathan and reis 2000;horynet al. 2005),

but the results have been questioned by others (coleman et al.
2004). moreover, human  xxxg232xxx  has been suggested to function as the mammalian adc (zhu et al. 2004). the phylogenetic tree presented here, however, does not support this
hypothesis. in our tree, the human, mouse, and rat  xxxg232xxx 
sequences are clearly clustered within the branch of chordata
odcs indicating that the  xxxg232xxx  sequences are very distantly
related to the adcs of plants and prokaryotes. when the human  xxxg232xxx  was first identified, it was proposed to function as
a tissue-specific antizyme inhibitor (pitkänen et al. 2001).
this hypothesis is supported by our tree, where the  xxxg232xxx 
sequences and the frog odc2 sequence form 1 branch, which
diverges from the branch containing the azi sequences. furthermore, the  xxxg232xxx  and azi sequences segregate from the
chordate odcs, which suggests that the  xxxg232xxx  and azi genes
are a result of a gene duplication event that occurred early in
the evolution of the chordate odc sequences.

trees are identical, inside the main branches, a few minor

changes can be observed in the tree topology. similarly
to the nj tree, the adc branch of the ml tree diverges into
2 branches but with only 52% bootstrap support (supplementary fig. 1, supplementary material online). in the
ml tree, however, the plant and cyanobacterial adcs
are located within the same branch, with a bootstrap support
of 72%, whereas in the nj tree the cyanobacterial adcs
cluster together with other bacterial adcs with 90% bootstrap support. previous studies (illingworth et al. 2003) support the topology of the ml tree where the plant adcs are
derived from the cyanobacterial adcs because, in plants,
adc has been shown to be expressed in the chloroplasts
(borrell et al. 1995).

substrate specificity and active-site structure
the decarboxylases are highly specific for their corresponding substrates. the specificity is obtained through
alterations at the region of the active site that recognizes
the nonreactive part of the substrate. in contrast, the plpbinding region of the active site accommodating the reactive
part of the substrate is well conserved. an amino group
of the substrate forms a schiff base with plp, and depending on the stereochemistry of the substrate, the carboxylate
group of the substrate binds to either the si or the re face of
plp. the carboxylate group of the d-stereocenter in diaminopimelate may form hydrogen bonds with the side chains
of his214a and ser364b (ray et al. 2002). in contrast, the
carboxylate group of the l-stereocenter of ornithine binds to
a hydrophobic and negatively charged pocket formed by the
side chains of phe397, tyr389, asp361, and the methylene
groups of lys69 (jackson et al. 2003).
according to the available crystal structures of decarboxylases complexed with ligands, the nonreactive part
of the substrate is accommodated next to a substructure
(strand–loop–helix) formed by met315–his333 (in human
odc) that seems to have a large impact on the active-site
structure. sequence variation within this substrate-defining
substructure appears to be critical for substrate selection.
mutational studies, together with the crystal structures of
dapdc and odc in complex with ligands, have revealed
that residues from this substructure participate in the binding of the nonreactive part of the corresponding substrate
(grishin et al. 1995; ray et al. 2002). no experimentally
determined structure of an adc is currently available, but
according to the structural modeling of synechocystis adc
(jantaro et al. 2006), 1 of the 3 aspartates suggested to bind
the guanidium group of arginine comes from the same sub-

strate-defining substructure. ray et al. (2002) have suggested
that the active sites of the decarboxylases have evolved to contain‘‘molecularrulers’’thatmeasurethelengthofthesubstrate.
ornithine, the substrate of odc is composed of a 4-carbon
chain, whereas diaminopimelate contains a 5-carbon chain,
and the substrate of adc, arginine, is the longest molecule
with a chain of 1 nitrogen and 5 carbon atoms. in odc, the
distance between the asp332a from the substrate-defining
substructure and the plp is ;7 å, whereas the distance between the corresponding tyr337a and plp in dapdc is
;10 å. in the structural model of adc, the distance between
asp521a from substrate-defining substructure and plp is
;13 å. these lengths agree well with the lengths of the corresponding substrates and thus support the theory that the activesiteofthedecarboxylaseshasevolvedawaytomeasurethe
length of the substrate, helping to ensure specificity.
in order to gain a deeper understanding of the relationship between the putative dc sequences and the dapdcs
and odcs, we examined the multiple-sequence alignment.
despite the close similarity between the odcs and the putative dcs, according to the alignment, there are several
sites where the sequences of the putative dcs are more similar to the dapdcs. for example, the residue on the c-terminal side of the plp-binding lysine is a cysteine in odc
(cys70) but an alanine in the putative dcs and dapdcs. in
another region, a conserved tryptophan (trp356 in human
odc) is substituted by glycine or alanine in the sequences
of the putative dcs, whereas in the dapdcs, the corresponding residue is alanine, valine, or glycine. when this
site in the crystal structures of odc and dapdc was compared, we noticed that the structural impact of this change is
not as severe as one might have expected: in the crystal
structure of methanococcus jannaschii dapdc (ray et al.
2002), the side chain of trp321 from a parallel strand
elsewhere in the fold occupies almost the same space as
trp356 in human odc. trp321 is not conserved in the eukaryotic odcs, but in dapdcs and in the putative dcs, there
is always an aromatic residue (tryptophan or tyrosine). this
suggests that the last common ancestor from which the
dapdcs and odcs evolved may have had an alanine on
the c-terminal side of the plp-binding lysine and an aromatic
residue equivalent to trp321 in m. jannaschii dapdc.
one of the putative dcs, s. ruminantium, has previously been characterized as a lysine/ xxxg1626xxx 
(takatsuka et al. 2000). in order to look into the possible
broader substrate specificity of the putative dcs, we analyzed the multiple-sequence alignment and studied the available crystal structures of the decarboxylases. close to the
active site of the eukaryotic odcs, there is a conserved glycine (gly201 in human odc) (fig. 5a), which is substituted
by a glutamine in the putative dc sequences. in the 2 known
dapdc x-ray structures, this residue is also glutamine. according to the sequence alignment, glutamine is also conserved in the adcs at this location but may be glutamine
or glycine in other dapdcs. significant differences in this
region are observed when the crystal structures of dapdcs
and odcs are compared. the glutamine in dapdc interacts with the main chain of a nearby loop, affecting the
3-dimensional structure of the loop, whereas the corresponding interaction is not possible in odc due to the presence of
glycine instead of glutamine. opposite to this residue, on the

in comparison with the 4 dapdc branches found in the
nj tree, there are only 3 main branches containing the
dapdc sequences in the ml tree (supplementary fig. 2, supplementary material online). the 4 epsilon-proteobacteria
sequences, which formed a separate branch in the nj tree,
form a branch together with the alpha-, beta-, delta-, and
gamma-proteobacteria in the ml tree. the dapdcs from archaea form 3 separate branches, and the dapdc of d. radiodurans segregates from a branch that contains the archaea
and the beta- and gamma-proteobacteria dapdcs. in the
ml tree, the odc of t. brucei is separated from the human
odc branch; however, the bootstrap support for this node is
67% (supplementary fig. 3, supplementary material online).
the bootstrap values of the ml tree are lower compared with the bootstrap values in the nj tree, with an average bootstrap support for the ml tree of 74% (calculated
as an average across all of the nodes), whereas the average
support for the nj tree is 82%. overall, there are 42 nodes
having bootstrap support below 60% in the ml tree but only
25 in the nj tree. although it appears that the nj method
works better in the current case, producing trees with higher
overall bootstrap confidence compared with the ml method,
the ml method may be more accurate for nodes where the
evolutionary time frame is relatively short, for example, the
short internal branch lengths associated with the dapdc
sequences and where the diversification of adcs occurs.

structural models of azi and  xxxg232xxx 
the sequence alignment reveals that there are important differences between the residues that interact with plp
and the residues essential for the decarboxylase reaction in
odc,  xxxg232xxx , and azi. in order to study the effects of the
substitutions on the protein structure, we have made homology models of the human  xxxg232xxx  and azi dimers. in odc,
the phosphate of plp is coordinated by several hydrogen
bonds as part of the phosphate-binding cup (denesyuk
et al. 2003). the network is formed by the main-chain
nitrogen of 3 residues, gly237, gly276, and arg277 (numbering from human odc), together with a conserved water
molecule and the side-chain nitrogen (nhe) of arg277 and
the side-chain oxygen (oh) of tyr389 (fig. 6a) (kern et al.
1999). arg277 has been mutated to alanine and shown to
reduce the plp-binding affinity 270-fold in odc (osterman et al. 1997). according to the homology model of
human azi, 2 key residues from the active site have been
replaced: arg277 would be substituted with a ser274 and
tyr389 with an asp387, and only the 3 main-chain interactions and water coordination of the phosphate group of
plp would be conserved in azi (fig. 6b). additionally,
in zebra fish azi, the lysine (lys69) that forms the schiff
base with plp in other decarboxylases is a ser69, and the
histidine (his197) that stacks with the pyridoxal ring of
plp is a gln195. these differences in the azis could indicate that the plp-binding affinity of the azi proteins is
much weaker in comparison to the odcs and that the azis,
for example, in zebra fish, may have even lost their ability to
bind plp, which is consistent with their functional role:
they bind an antizyme that targets odc for degradation
(murakami et al. 1992) and have no intrinsic enzymatic activity (murakami et al. 1996).
in contrast to the azis, the residues that bind plp in the
odcps are conserved, and the odcps probably bind plp in
a manner similar to the odcs. the odcps, however, appear
to be incapable of catalyzing the decarboxylation reaction
because several key residues directly involved in catalysis
are not conserved. most notably cys360, which is essential
for the enzymatic reaction in odcs, is substituted by a valine
in human (val361), rat, and mouse (val360)  xxxg232xxx . previ-

ously, it was shown that in odc, the mutation of cys360 to
alanine or serine reduces the kcat value by 50–1,000-fold and
changes the catalyzed reaction into a transamination reaction, which results in the formation of pyridoxamine-5phosphate and gamma-aminobutyraldehyde (jackson et al.
2000). the function of  xxxg232xxx  is not clear, but based on
our modeling results and the phylogenetic analysis, it seems
unlikely that  xxxg232xxx  accounts for the reported adc activity
present in mammalian cells but instead could function in
transamination.
conclusion
the existence of odc-like bacterial and archaeal
decarboxylases, called putative decarboxylases in this study,
supports the theory that the reaction specificity of the plpdependent decarboxylases evolved before the substrate
specificity. thus, the ancestral decarboxylase is envisioned
as having promiscuous substrate specificity, catalyzing the
decarboxylation of arginine, diaminopimelate, lysine, and
ornithine and possibly other amino acids too. the ancestral
decarboxylase probably was a dimeric enzyme; however,
from our results, it is not possible to conclude whether
the monomer contained 2 or 3 domains. adcs could have
gained the ;85–amino acid insertion, or this insertion could
have been lost from the other decarboxylases at the time of
their divergence. the dapdcs and odcs are more closely
related to each other than to adc, and as evidence of this,
the putative decarboxylases have retained several features
found in dapdcs that have subsequently been lost in the
odcs. sequence and structure comparisons suggest that
the putative decarboxylases may have retained the ability
of the ancestral decarboxylase to recognize several
substrates.
the rapid pace of identifying new protein sequences
from genome projects is increasing; however, the annotation process is seriously lagging behind (ouzonis and karp
2003). with blast searches, one can identify homologous
sequences, but sequence matching on its own is often not
sufficient to reliably identify the likely function of the protein coded by a newly sequenced gene. phylogenetic analysis is an alternative method to classify protein sequences in
cases where the studied protein shares sequence homology
with a superfamily made up of subfamilies spanning a wide
range of similarity (eisen 1998; eisen and fraser 2003). in
this study, the decarboxylases from m. burtonii and f. acidarmanus were identified as dapdcs, whereas the other
putative dcs clustered with the odcs. whether all the
putative dcs are capable of using both lysine and ornithine
as substrates, similarly to s. ruminantium odc, cannot be
determined based on this study but should be experimentally
verified. however, we consider phylogenetic analysis to
be a suitable complementary method for annotating new
sequences of yet unknown function.

other side of the active site, there is the substrate-defining
substructure (met315–his333) that contributes to the substrate specificity of the decarboxylases (fig. 5a). the residues in this substructure are well conserved within the
eukaryotic odcs but are clearly different in the putative
dcs (fig. 5b). taken together, the dissimilarities between
the putative dcs and eukaryotic odcs suggest that the
3-dimensional structure of the active site in the putative
dcs differs from that of the eukaryotic odc structures.
the distinct active-site structure could enable the putative
dcs to recognize and bind other substrates in addition to
ornithine, for example, lysine in the case of the decarboxylase of s. ruminantium (takatsuka et al. 2000). due to
the large differences in the substrate-defining substructure
of the putative dcs in comparison to the odcs, we have
not attempted to model the putative dcs because it is unlikely that a reliable model can be constructed for their
active-site structure.

note added in proof
a recently published paper reports that the mouse
 xxxg232xxx  has antizyme inhibitor activity and no ornithine
or arginine decarboxylating activity (lopez-contreras
et al. 2006), which is consistent with our results indicating
that  xxxg232xxx  cannot function as a decarboxylase.
