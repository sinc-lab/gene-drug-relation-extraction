a b s t r a c t
existing antimuscarinic drugs for overactive bladder have high afﬁnity for m3/m1 muscarinic receptors and
consequently produce m3/m1-mediated adverse effects including dry mouth, constipation, mydriasis and
somnolence. td-6301 is a m2/4 muscarinic receptor-selective antagonist developed for the treatment of
overactive bladder. the present studies characterize the in vitro and in vivo pharmacological properties of
this molecule in comparison to other marketed antimuscarinics agents. in radioligand binding studies, td6301 was found to possess high afﬁnity for human m2 muscarinic receptor (ki = 0.36 nm) and was 31, 36, 2
and 128-fold selective for the human m2 muscarinic receptor compared to the m1, m3, m4 and m5 muscarinic
receptors, respectively. the in vivo bladder selectivity of td-6301 in rats was determined to be 26, 28, n100,
16 and 0.4-fold, respectively, assessed by comparing its potency for inhibition of volume-induced bladder
contractions to that for inhibition of oxotremorine-induced salivation, inhibition of small-intestinal transit,
decreases in locomotor activity, increases in pupil diameter and increases in heart rate. td-6301 was more
potent in inhibiting volume-induced bladder contractions (id50 = 0.075 mg/kg) compared to oxotremorineinduced salivation (id50 = 1.0 mg/kg) resulting in a bladder/salivary gland selectivity ratio greater than that
observed for  xxxd3398xxx , oxybutynin,  xxxd1813xxx  and solifenacin. the preclinical properties of td-6301
suggest that this molecule is likely to be efﬁcacious in overactive bladder patients with a lower propensity to
cause  xxxg449xxx  mediated adverse effects.

1. introduction
overactive bladder, which is characterized by symptoms of urinary
frequency, urgency and urge incontinence, is a chronic and debilitating disease (abrams et al., 2003). the symptoms of overactive bladder
are often attributed to involuntary contractions of the detrusor muscle
during bladder ﬁlling, a condition known as detrusor instability or
overactivity (de groat, 1997). although the precise etiology of
overactive bladder is unknown, it is generally accepted that activation
of muscarinic receptors in the detrusor via acetylcholine released from
postganglionic parasympathetic nerves is the ultimate mechanism
driving detrusor overactivity in the diseased bladder (de groat, 1993).
thus, it is not surprising that muscarinic antagonists serve as the
cornerstone in the pharmacotherapy of overactive bladder. although
these antimuscarinic drugs have adequate efﬁcacy, they fail to
selectively inhibit abnormal detrusor contractions. furthermore,
existing drugs have marginal therapeutic indices owing to mechanism

based dose-limiting adverse effects such as dry mouth, constipation
and blurred vision. this results in poor patient compliance and limits
the therapeutic dose. more than 80% of patients who initiate therapy
discontinue within 3 to 6 months because they do not tolerate the
side effects (kelleher et al., 1997; chui et al., 2004). the four leading
antimuscarinic drugs for overactive bladder ( xxxd3398xxx , oxybutynin,
 xxxd1813xxx  and solifenacin) all have high afﬁnity for m3 and/or m1
muscarinic receptors (hegde et al., 2004). it is not surprising that
these drugs have a poor tolerability proﬁle given the key role played
by the m3/m1 muscarinic receptors in the salivary gland, gastrointestinal, ocular and behavioral function (anagnostaras et al., 2003;
caulﬁeld, 1993;  xxxd1704xxx  et al., 1996; wess, 2004).
m2 and m3 are the predominant muscarinic receptor subtypes found
within the bladder and are present in a ratio of about 4 to 1 (m2:m3)
(hegde and  xxxd1704xxx ,1999; hegde, 2006). m3 muscarinic receptors mediate
the direct contractile responses necessary for normal bladder function
through a mechanism that depends on entry of extracellular calcium
through l-type calcium channels and activation of a  xxxg1969xxx 
(schneider et al., 2004). the functional role of the m2 muscarinic
receptor in detrusor contraction remains unclear. studies suggest that
m2 muscarinic receptor activation also mediate detrusor contraction but

2.3.1. animals
male and female sprague dawley rats (harlan, san diego, ca)
weighing 90–350 g were used in these studies. the animal colony
holding rooms were temperature controlled and kept on a 12 h light/
dark cycle. rats were housed in pairs in plastic cages with corncob
chip bedding. food and water was available ad libitum.
fig. 1. chemical structure of td-6301 is composed of a benzhydryl motif substituted
with a carboxamide and a pyrrolidine. the pyrrolidine is linked to a 4-amino piperidine
through a heptyl alkyl chain. the exocyclic tertiary amine contains an isopropyl
substituent while the piperidine has a 4-methoxy pyridine methyl group. the chemical
name is proposed to be 1-(4-methoxypyridin-3-ylmethyl)-4-{n-[7-(3-(s)-1-carbamoyl-1,1-diphenylmethyl)pyrrolidin-1-yl) hept-1-yl]-n-(isopropyl) amino} piperidine.

through an indirect mechanism involving inhibition of sympathetically
mediated ( xxxg838xxx  adrenoceptor evoked) relaxation via a camp-dependent
mechanism (hegde et al., 1997; yamanishi et al., 2002; ehlert et al.,
2005; ehlert et al., 2007). more importantly, since m2 muscarinic
receptors do not appear to be functionally important in the salivary
gland, gastrointestinal tract and eye (bymaster et al., 2003;  xxxd1704xxx  et al.,
1996;  xxxd1704xxx  and harris,1993; gil et al., 1997; ishizaka et al.,1998; messer
et al., 1990), antagonists which selectively target this receptor may be
expected to possess a better tolerability proﬁle. however, the potential
effects of an m2 muscarinic receptor selective antagonist on heart rate
and in the central nervous system (cns) needs to be considered given
the known importance of m2 muscarinic receptors in regulation of heart
rate (caulﬁeld, 1993) and autoregulation of acetylcholine release in the
brain (zhang et al., 2002).
td-6301 (fig. 1) is a selective m2/m4 muscarinic receptor
antagonist developed for the treatment of overactive bladder. the
objective of the present studies was to characterize the in vitro and in
vivo pharmacological properties of this molecule in comparison to
marketed antimuscarinics agents. the in vivo bladder selectivity of the
molecule was assessed in a range of animal models that evaluated the
antimuscarinic potency in the bladder, salivary gland, eye, gastrointestinal tract, heart and cns.
2. materials and methods
2.1. material
td-6301 was synthesized at theravance, inc.  xxxd3398xxx  (tartrate
salt), oxybutynin (hydrochloride salt),  xxxd1813xxx  (triﬂuoroacetate
salt) and solifenacin (hydrochloride salt) were all prepared using
published methods. all test compounds were dissolved in 5% dextrose
in water and formulated with respect to the base weight of the
compound.
2.2. in vitro pharmacological characterization of td-6301 in human
muscarinic receptor subtypes; displacement of [3h]-n-methylscopolamine
membranes were prepared from cho-k1 cells stably expressing
the human muscarinic receptor subtypes,  xxxg447xxx ,  xxxg448xxx ,  xxxg449xxx  or  xxxg450xxx .
membrane fractions expressing the human m5 muscarinic receptor
were purchased from perkin elmer (waltham, ma). radioligand
displacement binding assays were performed using [3h] n-methyl
scopolamine (1 nm ﬁnal concentration) in a buffer consisting of
10 mm hepes, 100 mm nacl, 10 mm mgcl2 and 0.025% bovine serum
albumin. following a 60 min incubation at 37 °c, membranes were
collected on glass ﬁber ﬁltermats pre-treated with 1% bsa using a
perkinelmer 96 well harvester. bound radioactivity was measured by
scintillation counting.
2.3. in vivo pharmacological characterization of td-6301
all studies were conducted in accordance with the theravance
institutional animal care and use committee.

2.4. m2/ xxxg449xxx  selectivity in pithed rats
the objective of this study was to determine the m2/m3 muscarinic
receptor selectivity of td-6301 in an in vivo setting. this was achieved
by determining the relative potency of td-6301 in antagonizing
 xxxd2586xxx  evoked m2 muscarinic receptor mediated decreases in
heart rate (bradycardia response) compared to  xxxg449xxx 
mediated decreases in mean arterial pressure (depressor response) in
angiotensin-supported pithed rats (armstrong et al., 2008).
female sprague–dawley rats (harlan, indianapolis, in) weighing
between 225 and 275 g were used in this study. the animal was
anesthetized with pentobarbital (60 mg/kg, i.p.). the trachea was
cannulated with pe-240 tubing. the right jugular vein (pe-10 fused to
pe-50 tubing) and both femoral veins (micro-renethane tubing) were
catheterized for i.v. drug administration. next, the femoral artery was
catheterized (pe-10 fused to pe-50 tubing) for measurement of arterial
pressure and heart rate. both vagus nerves were isolated adjacent to the
carotid artery and transected. the animal was then pithed through the
orbit of the eye with a stainless steel pithing rod (1.5 mm in diameter)
and ventilated artiﬁcially (60 cycles/min with a volume of 1.5 ml/kg of
body weight) using a small animal ventilator (harvard apparatus model
683, hollistan, ma). following a stabilization period, angiotensin-ii
(0.3 µg/kg/min, i.v.) was infused via one of the femoral veins to elevate
arterial pressure to normotensive levels (between 100 and 125 mm hg).
the angiotensin-ii supported arterial pressure was allowed to stabilize
for approximately 15 min. thereafter, a non-cumulative dose–response
curve to  xxxd2586xxx  (i.v.) was constructed. td-6301 or vehicle was
dosed as a continuous i.v. infusion, via one of the femoral veins, to study
antagonistic effects under steady-state drug exposure conditions.
a loading infusion dose and a maintenance dose was delivered
over 30 min, based on previously obtained pharmacokinetic data, to
achieve appropriate steady-state drug levels. thereafter, a noncumulative dose–response curve to  xxxd2586xxx  was constructed.
after each  xxxd2586xxx  dose, the depressor and bradycardic responses
were allowed to recover to baseline before administration of the
subsequent dose before administration of td-6301.
2.5. volume-induced bladder contraction model
female sprague–dawley rats (harlan, indianapolis, in) weighing
between 180 and 300 g were used in this study. animals were
anesthetized with urethane (1.5 g/kg, s.c.) and the level of anesthesia
was maintained with additional supplemental doses (0.25 g/kg, s.c.) if
required. following cannulation of the trachea (pe-205), the femoral
vein was catheterized (micro-renathane tubing, 0.3 mm id × 0.64 mm
od) for drug administration. the lower abdominal cavity was exposed
and the ureters were ligated and severed proximal to the ligation.
the bladder was cannulated via the urethra to measure intra-vesical
pressure. the bladder cannula was secured in place around the
external urethral oriﬁce using a purse string suture. after surgery,
saline was infused (200 µl/min for ∼ 5 min followed by a maintenance
infusion of ∼ 5 µl/min) into the bladder to evoke rhythmic volumeinduced bladder contractions which were manifested as rhythmic
changes in intravesical pressure. after a stabilization period, the
vehicle was dosed i.v. and changes in volume-induced bladder
contraction amplitude were recorded for 15 min. thereafter, the
appropriate dose of the antagonist was administered and changes in
volume-induced bladder contraction amplitude recorded for 15 min
after which atropine (0.1 mg/kg, i.v.) was dosed and data was recorded

a. mcnamara et al. / european journal of pharmacology 605 (2009) 145–152

for an additional 15 min. in this model, the atropine-sensitive
muscarinic component accounts for 50–55% of the volume-induced
bladder contraction amplitude (hegde et al., 1997).
2.6. anti-sialagogue model
anti-sialagogue activity was evaluated by determining the effects
of td-6301 or standards on subcutaneously dosed oxotremorine
(muscarinic agonist)-induced salivation (sanchez and lembol, 1994).
female sprague–dawley rats (harlan, indianapolis, in) weighing
between 180 and 350 g were used in this study. animals were
anesthetized with urethane (1.5 g/kg, s.c.) with additional supplemental doses (0.25 g/kg, s.c.) if required. following induction of
anesthesia and a stabilization period, either vehicle or the appropriate
dose of the antagonist was dosed i.v. via the tail vein. the animal was
placed head down on its ventral side at a 20° angle plane. a preweighed sponge was placed inside the animal's mouth. five min after
administration of vehicle/antagonist, the animal was challenged with
oxotremorine (1 mg/kg, s.c.). ten min later, the sponge was removed
and re-weighed to determine the output of saliva.
2.7. pupil dilation model
effects on ocular function were evaluated by determining the
inﬂuence of test drugs on pupil diameter in conscious rats (parry and
heathcote, 1982). conscious male sprague–dawley rats (harlan,
indianapolis, in) weighing between 90 and 150 g were held under a
microscope (jena03, magniﬁcation 0.8×, objective gf/pw 12.5× (20)),
the right eyepiece of which had a graduated eyepiece for measurement of pupil diameter. a ﬁber optic light (fibre-lite, dolah-jenner
industries, boxborough, ma) was directed towards the left eye of the
animal. baseline pupil diameter was recorded. one min later, the
animal was dosed i.v. via the tail vein with either vehicle or the
appropriate dose of the antagonist. ten min later, measurements of
pupil diameter were repeated.
2.8. locomotor activity model
effects on behavior were evaluated by determining the inﬂuence of
td-6301 or standards on locomotor activity in conscious rats. in this
model, cns-penetrant muscarinic antagonists produce increases in
locomotor activity due to antagonism of inhibitory muscarinic receptors
(m4) in the nigro-striatal pathway (shannon and peters, 1990).
male sprague–dawley rats (harlan, indianapolis, in) weighing
between 200 and 300 g were used in this study. locomotor activity
was measured by placing the animals in a cage that is positioned
between infrared photocell beams (digiscan dmicro animal activity
monitor with micropro v 1.30i software, accuscan instruments,
columbus, oh). movement of animals interferes with the light beam
that allows for objective measurement of locomotor activity. on the
day of the study, baseline locomotor activity was measured in rats for
60 min. the animals were then dosed i.v. via the tail vein with either
vehicle or the appropriate dose of the antagonist. locomotor activity
was measured and recorded for 60 min post-dose. atropine (10 mg/kg,
i.v.) was used as the positive control.
2.9. gastro-intestinal motility model
effects on intestinal function were evaluated by determining the
inﬂuence of test drugs on small intestinal transit of a charcoal meal in
rats. female sprague–dawley rats (harlan, indianapolis, in) weighing
between 140 and 220 g were used in this study. animals were dosed i.v.
via the tail vein with either vehicle or the appropriate dose of the
antagonist. five min later, a charcoal meal (10% charcoal in 2% arabic
gum) was administered by oral gavage. twenty min later, the animal
was sacriﬁced and the small intestine was removed and stretched out

147

on the bench. the length of the intestine from the pyloric sphincter
to the ileo–caecal junction and distance traveled by the charcoal
front was measured with a graduated ruler and recorded. atropine
(1 mg/kg, i.v.) was used as a positive control and reduced small
intestinal transit by 30–50% of the vehicle control.
2.10. cardiovascular model
cardiovascular adverse effects, chieﬂy tachycardia, are a potential
concern during antimuscarinic therapy. tachycardia results from
antagonism of m2 muscarinic receptors in the heart leading to
suppression of the inhibitory vagal drive to the heart (hulme et al.,
1990; caulﬁeld, 1993). the objective of this study was to assess the
effects of td-6301 on mean arterial pressure and heart rate in conscious,
instrumented free-roaming rats.
male sprague–dawley rats (harlan, indianapolis, in) weighing
between 200 and 300 g were used in this study. animals were
anesthetized with isoﬂurane (5% induction and 3% maintenance) to
allow cannulae implantation. the intrascapular and femoral triangle
areas were shaved and cleansed with betadine and 70% alcohol. a
surgical drape was used to isolate and provide a sterile surgical ﬁeld.
animals were instrumented for measurement of arterial pressure (via
femoral artery) and i.v. drug administration (via the femoral vein). the
arterial cannula was constructed by fusing pe-10 to pe-50 tubing.
the venous cannula was made of micro-renathane tubing (0.033 in.
id, braintree scientiﬁc, braintree, ma). the arterial and venous
cannulae were tunneled subcutaneously and exteriorized through
the midscapular region. both incisions were cleansed free of blood and
sutured with 4–0 silk. the cannulae were “locked” with a solution of
1000 u heparin and 50% sucrose, sealed with stainless steel pins and
secured into a jacketed pouch. after surgery, animals were administered buprenorphine (0.05 mg/kg, i.m.) plus 3 ml of saline and allowed
to recover from anesthesia on a warming blanket before being
returned to their study room in the vivarium. on the day of the study,
arterial catheters were connected to pressure tranducers and baseline
hemodynamic parameters were measured for 30 min after which
vehicle or td-6301 was dosed i.v. (dosing volume of 0.3 ml/kg) with
escalating doses administered every 10 min.
2.11. data analysis
2.11.1. in vitro
the binding data were analyzed by nonlinear regression analysis
using graphpad prism software. ki values for test compounds
were calculated from observed ic50 values and the kd value of the
radioligand (determined from saturation binding studies performed
for each receptor subtype) according to (cheng and prusoff, 1973).
2.11.2. pithed rat
heart rate was measured at pre-dose and at the peak response post
 xxxd2586xxx . mean arterial pressure was measured at pre-dose and
following recovery of the heart rate response to within 15% of premethacholine values (to minimize the confounding inﬂuence of heart
rate changes on mean arterial pressure). changes from baseline (predose) in mean arterial pressure and heart rate were calculated for each
dose of  xxxd2586xxx . dose-ratios (dr) were calculated and a schild plot
(log [dr-1] vs log [antagonist]) was constructed from which estimates of
dr10 (dose required to produce a 10-fold dextral shift of the agonist
dose response curve) were obtained for both the m2 and m3 muscarinic
receptor endpoints. the m2/ xxxg449xxx  selectivity ratio was
calculated as the the ratio of dr10 (m3) to dr10 (m2).
2.11.3. volume-induced bladder contractions
the average volume-induced bladder contraction amplitude
during the 5–15 min post-drug (test antagonist/atropine) period
was obtained and subtracted from the average volume-induced

148

a. mcnamara et al. / european journal of pharmacology 605 (2009) 145–152

bladder contraction amplitude during the 5–15 min post-vehicle
period to obtain the test antagonist and atropine-induced change in
volume-induced bladder contraction amplitude. the inhibitory effects
of the test drug were normalized to the atropine response and the
resulting dose–response curves were ﬁtted with a four parameter
logistic equation to obtain estimates of id50 (dose required to produce
50% of the maximal response).
2.11.4. oxotremorine-induced salivation
dose–response curves were ﬁtted to obtain estimates of id50 (dose
required to produce 50% of the maximal response) and id25 (dose
required to produce 25% of the maximal response).
2.11.5. pupil dilation
change in pupil diameter (post-dose — baseline) was calculated
for each treatment. atropine (0.1 mg/kg, i.v.) was used as a positive
control. dose–response curves were to obtain estimates of ed50 (dose
required to produce 50% of the atropine response).
2.11.6. locomotor
the total number of ambulatory counts during the 30-min period
post-dosing was used as the endpoint. dose–response curves were
ﬁtted to obtain estimates of ed50 (dose required to produce 50% of the
atropine response).
2.11.7. small intestinal transit
intestinal transit is measured as the percent of distance traveled by
the charcoal front relative to the total length of the intestine. in vehicle
treated animals, distance traveled by the charcoal front was usually
approximately 60–70% of the total small intestinal length. dose–
response curves were ﬁtted to obtain estimates of id50 (dose required
to produce 50% of the atropine response).
2.11.8. cardiovascular
heart rate and mean arterial pressure were derived from the
pressure pulse using mp100 biopac data acquisition systems (biopac
systems, santa barbara, ca). change in heart rate and mean arterial
pressure from baseline was used for analysis. statistical analysis was
performed using two-way anova using bonferroni post-hoc test.
p b 0.05 was considered to be statistically signiﬁcant.

selective for the human m2 muscarinic receptor compared to the m3
muscarinic receptor (ki = 13 nm). across the ﬁve muscarinic receptor
subtypes, the rank order from highest to lowest binding afﬁnity for
td-6301 was:  xxxg448xxx  =  xxxg450xxx  n  xxxg447xxx  n  xxxg449xxx  n  xxxg451xxx  (fig. 2, table 1). in
comparison,  xxxd3398xxx , oxybutynin and solifenacin did not discriminate between the ﬁve muscarinic subtypes;  xxxd1813xxx  had high
afﬁnity and selectivity for the  xxxg449xxx ; solifenacin
had high afﬁnity for all ﬁve subtypes with marginal selectivity for
the m1 muscarinic receptor over the other four subtypes. oxybutynin
displayed the highest afﬁnity for the m1, m3 and m4 muscarinic
receptor subtypes.
3.2. m2/m3 selectivity in pithed rats
as reported previously in the pithed rat model,  xxxd3398xxx  and
solifenacin do not discriminate between m2 and m3 muscarinic
receptors in the pithed rat model in vivo, oxybutynin is modestly
selective for m3 receptors whereas  xxxd1813xxx  is highly m3 muscarinic
receptor selective (armstrong et al., 2008). in contrast, td-6301
produced dose-dependent dextral shifts of the  xxxd2586xxx  bradycardia (m2 muscarinic receptor) and depressor (m3 muscarinic
receptor) dose–response curves. the dr10s (mg/kg, i.v.) for td-6301
were 0.029 for m2 muscarinic receptor antagonism and 0.6 for m3
muscarinic receptor antagonism (fig. 3). the calculated m2/m3
muscarinic receptor selectivity ratio of td-6301 was 21.

normalized to percent speciﬁc binding of [3h] nms and were ﬁt to a four-parameter
logistic equation. hill coefﬁcients were not signiﬁcantly different from unity and were
therefore, ﬁxed to 1. inhibition binding constants (ki) were calculated from ic50s values
according to methods described by cheng and prusoff (1973).

3.7. cardiovascular effects
baseline mean arterial pressure ranged from 115–120 mm hg and
baseline heart rate ranged from 415–447 beats/min in the drugtreated groups. td-6301 (0.03–1 mg/kg, i.v.) produced dose-dependent increases in heart rate. however these increases in heart rate
were not statistically signiﬁcant in comparison to vehicle treated
animals, perhaps because of the small sample size. the maximal
increases in heart rate were 15, 47, 55 and 49 beats/min, respectively
at 0.03, 0.1, 0.3 and 1 mg/kg, i.v. (fig. 5). td-6301 had no effects on
mean arterial pressure.

muscarinic antagonists currently remain the only effective therapeutic strategy for controlling the symptoms of overactive bladder,
however the non-selective or  xxxg449xxx  selective proﬁle of
existing drugs inevitably limit the therapeutic index of these agents due
to adverse effects. incidences of dry mouth are particularly confounding
as patients increase ﬂuid consumption thus marginalizing the beneﬁts
of controlling overactive bladder with antimuscarinic therapies. constipation, blurred vision and cns (fatigue, confusion and restlessness)
effects reported during treatment may also inﬂuence patient compliance and persistence. ideally, antimuscarinic therapy for overactive

a. mcnamara et al. / european journal of pharmacology 605 (2009) 145–152

bladder should minimize bladder dysfunction and have an acceptable
tolerability proﬁle. targeting overactive bladder with an m2 muscarinic
receptor selective antagonist may be an attractive alternative to current
non-selective or  xxxg449xxx  selective treatment options
since it has the potential of selectively inhibiting detrusor instability
without causing the aforementioned antimuscarinic adverse effects.
radioligand displacement studies demonstrated that td-6301
possesses a high afﬁnity to the human m2 muscarinic receptor subtype
and is highly selective for m2 over the  xxxg449xxx  subtype.
the unique m2/ xxxg449xxx  selectivity of td-6301 was also
reproduced in vivo in pithed rats. in contrast, the marketed comparator
molecules ( xxxd3398xxx , oxybutynin,  xxxd1813xxx  and solifenacin) were
either non-selective or displayed some selectivity for the m1 and/or m3
muscarinic receptor.
inhibitory effects of td-6301 on bladder function, mediated at
least in part through m2 muscarinic receptor antagonism, were
assessed on reﬂex volume-induced bladder contractions in anesthetized rats (lecci et al., 1995; hegde et al., 1997; sugaya and de groat,
2007). this model is unique and highly relevant for the following three
reasons: ﬁrst, the reﬂex contractions in this model are of physiological
relevance since they require the operation of the entire spinal-bulbospinal micturition reﬂex (de groat et al., 1993); second, it allows one to
study the effects of drugs on bladder function in isolation without the
confounding inﬂuence of outlet resistance changes; third, since the
bladder contractions are mediated isovolumetrically, there is concomitant activation of both parasympathetic and sympathetic systems
allowing one to study the interaction of m2 muscarinic receptor and
beta adrenoceptors in an in vivo setting.
td-6301,  xxxd3398xxx , oxybutynin,  xxxd1813xxx  and solifenacin dosedependently inhibited volume induced bladder contractions. the high
bladder inhibitory potencies of all drugs which have varying potencies
and selectivities for m2 and m3 muscarinic receptors are consistent
with a functional role of both m2 and m3 muscarinic receptors in
mediation of vibc (hegde et al., 1997). oxybutynin and  xxxd1813xxx 
were equipotent in inhibiting volume-induced bladder and salivation.
the discrepancy between the rank order of binding afﬁnities and in
vivo bladder potency for td-6301 and the comparator molecules could
be explained by three factors. first, the molecular weight of td-6301 is
1.5 to 2-fold higher than the comparator molecules. second, inhibition
of vibc by td-6301 is likely to be mediated by both m2 and m3
receptors and this is reﬂected by the shallower inhibitory dose–
response curve of td-6301 compared to the other molecules. third,
differences in pharmacokinetic exposures of the molecules could also
contribute to their potency differences in vivo.
 xxxd3398xxx  and solifenacin had a modest degree of bladder/
salivary selectivity. by contrast, td-6301 demonstrated the highest
degree of bladder/salivary selectivity at the id50 dose level. it is
important to note that td-6301, unlike other agents, was able to
inhibit volume-induced bladder up to 80% with minimal inhibition of
oxotremorine-induced salivation. these data are consistent with a
functional role of m2 muscarinic receptors in volume-induced bladder
contractions but not in salivation. the bladder inhibitory effects of td6301 and other molecules need to be conﬁrmed in a conscious animal
model of cystometry. the role of m4 muscarinic receptors in the
inhibitory effects of td-6301 cannot be ruled out although there
is limited evidence for a functional role of this subtype in bladder
function.
the bladder-to-ocular selectivity of td-6301 (n24-fold) is equivalent or slightly better than that of  xxxd3398xxx  but greatly exceeds that
of oxybutynin,  xxxd1813xxx  and solifenacin. the bladder-to-gut
selectivity of td-6301, based on inhibition of transport of a charcoal
meal, is equivalent to that of  xxxd3398xxx  and solifenacin but exceeds
that of oxybutynin and  xxxd1813xxx . these observations are in
accordance with the low afﬁnity of td-6301 for m3 muscarinic
receptors. the bladder/cns selectivity of td-6301, based on increased
locomotor activity, is equivalent to that of  xxxd3398xxx  and  xxxd1813xxx 

151

but exceeds that of oxybutynin and solifenacin. these observations are
consistent with the low afﬁnity of td-6301 for m1 muscarinic
receptors and its limited ability to penetrate the cns (unpublished
data). the modest positive chronotropic effects of td-6301 are likely
the result of m2 muscarinic receptor antagonistic activity and raise the
concern that selective m2 muscarinic receptor antagonism might
cause increases in heart rate in humans by suppression of vagal drive
to the heart. it should be noted that the elderly population, which
represents the bulk of overactive bladder patients, exhibit diminished
cardiac vagal/muscarinic responsiveness (brodde et al., 1998). nevertheless, it is pertinent to note that a m2 muscarinic receptor selective
antagonist has never been clinically assessed in the target overactive
bladder population and the effect on heart rate in this population is
unknown at present.
5. conclusion
in rats, the bladder-to-salivary gland selectivity of td-6301 (14 26-fold) and bladder-to-ocular selectivity (n24-fold) is superior to all
competitors. furthermore, the bladder-to-gut selectivity of td-6301 is
equivalent to that of  xxxd3398xxx  but exceeds oxybutynin,  xxxd1813xxx 
and solifenacin. lastly, the bladder-to-cns selectivity of td-6301 is
equivalent to that of  xxxd3398xxx  and  xxxd1813xxx  but exceeds that of
oxybutynin and solifenacin. overall, td-6301 is a highly m2-selective
antagonist that has the potential to be efﬁcacious in overactive
bladder patients, causing little or no dry mouth, ocular adverse effects,
(mydriasis and blurred vision), constipation or adverse cns effects at
therapeutic doses in overactive bladder patients. the potential of td6301 to cause increases in heart rate in the target population needs to
be considered during clinical development of this compound.
