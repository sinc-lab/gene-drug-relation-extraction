abstract
from the structure activity relationship, two new analogs, 2 and 3, of the potent progesterone antagonist mifepristone 1 have been
designed. the syntheses of these two analogs have been achieved in eleven steps through modified synthetic sequences and improved
procedures starting from (⫹)-estrone. in comparison with mifepristone 1, the relative binding affinities of compound 2 for the progesterone
receptor was found to be more, whereas that of compound 3 was less. © 2000 elsevier science inc. all rights reserved.

1. introduction
in 1980, the french pharmaceutical company roussel–
uclaf announced the discovery [1,2] of ru-486, now
known by the generic name mifepristone (1). this was the
first antiprogestin to be developed. mifepristone (1), when
used in combination with a prostaglandin, effectively and
safely terminates early pregnancies. it is already in use [1,2]
as an abortifacient in france, uk, sweden, and china, has
passed the clinical trials in usa, and is under clinical trials
in india. it is also a potent antiglucocorticoid and shows
promising activity in treating estrogen-dependent gynecological disorders and hormone deficient tumors.
over the years, a number of mifepristone analogs have

been synthesized [3– 6] and were tested for their antiprogestin activity. teutsch et al. [7] have synthesized a variety
of 11␤-substituted 19-norsteroids. among these compounds, 11␤-vinyl and 11␤-phenyl compounds showed a
high degree of binding affinity for the cytoplasmic uterine
 xxxg1737xxx , whereas the 11␤-allyl and 11␤-benzyl-19-norsteroids showed very low binding affinity. thus,
shifting the unsaturation by one carbon atom practically
eliminates the receptor binding affinity. high binding affinity of the 11␤-19-norsteroid led to the hypothesis that in the
region corresponding to the 11␤-position of the steroids, a
pocket exists in the  xxxg1737xxx , where hydrophobic interactions are probably involved (scheme 1).
a very recent study by spitz and agranat [8] revealed
that the 17␣-substituent imparts higher binding affinity
for the receptor and the substituent at 11␤-position is
responsible for its antagonistic action. it has also been
reported [9] that replacement of the 11␤-(dimethylaminophenyl) substituent with the 11␤-(acetophenyl) moiety
increases the relative binding affinity for the  xxxg1737xxx  in rat and lowers the relative binding affinity
for the  xxxg1601xxx  than that of mifepristone
(1). in fact, the most active compound in this series, org

33628, has been claimed to be 32⫻ as active as mifepristone in inducing abortions in rats, while being significantly less active as an antiglucocorticoid [8]. compound org 33628, is a 17-spirofuran, 11␤-(4acetophenyl) analog of mifepristone.
in anticipation of changing the relative binding affinity for the receptor, we planned to incorporate an isopropyl group in place of methyl (e.g. 3-methyl-1-butynyl
side chain), at 17␣-position and successfully achieved the
synthesis of a new analog (2) of mifepristone (1). furthermore, with this new 17␣-alkynyl moiety in compound (2), 4-acetophenyl group was introduced in the
11␤-position to afford another new analog (3) of mifepristone (1). modification of both the active sites (at 17␣
and 11␤) are expected to bring about a cumulative effect
on the receptor binding affinity as well as antiglucocorticoid activity of compound (3).
herein, we wish to report, the syntheses of two new
analogs, (2) and (3), of mifepristone (1), starting from (⫹)estrone. alteration of reported [6] synthetic sequences furnished the target compounds (2) and (3) in higher overall
yields. moreover, introduction of 3-methyl-1-butynyl moiety at 17␣-position by nonhazardous modified method and a
highly chemoselective epoxidation of 5(10)-olefin with a
catalytic amount of hexafluoroacetone in h2o2 are the salient features of these syntheses. the structure of compound
(2) was confirmed by a single crystal x-ray.

3. results and discussion
syntheses of our two new analogs 2 and 3 of mifepristone 1 start from estra-5 (10), 9 (11)-dien-3, xxxd2153xxx , cy-

clic-3-(1,2-ethanediyl acetal) 4 [10,11] (scheme 2). introduction of a 3-methyl-1-butynyl side chain at 17 ␣
orientation of compound 4 was tried with 3-methylbut-1yne [12] and n-butyl lithium in thf at temperatures ranging
from ⫺78° to 25°c. the reaction furnished a complex
mixture of products from which we failed to isolate the
desired product 5. we then turned our attention at an efficient procedure for the generation of 3-methyl-1-butynyllithium in situ in the reaction mixture .this was accomplished by the reaction of 3-methyl-1, 1-dibromobut-1-en in
thf with 2 equivalents of n-buli in hexane. 3-methyl-1,
1-dibromobut-1-en was prepared by the reaction of cbr4
with isobutyraldehyde in the presence of triphenylphosphine by a reported [13] procedure. alkynylation of 4 with
3-methyl-1-butynyl lithium proceeded smoothly to give the
17␣-alkynylated compound 5 in 71% yield as a foam. chemoselective epoxidation of the 5 [10] double bond of 5 was
achieved with h2o2 and a catalytic amount of hexafluoroacetone trihydrate to get a mixture of 5, 10␣-epoxide 6 and
5, 10␤-epoxide in good yield and in the ratio of 4:1. the
isomeric ratio was assigned from the integration of the 200
mhz 1h nmr spectrum of the epoxides that showed two
signals at 6.1 and 5.9 ppm for the c-11 hydrogen of the ␣
and the ␤ isomer respectively. the combination of hexafluoroacetone with h2o2 produces 2-hydroperoxyhexafluoro2- xxxd3026xxx , a reactive oxidizing agent [14] possessing con-

b.g. hazra et al. / steroids 65 (2000) 157–162

siderable selectivity, particularly in the oxidation of
strerically hindered olefins. moreover, the byproduct of
epoxidation, 2-hydroxyhexafluoro- xxxd2400xxx , readily disproportionates with h2o2 to regenerate 2-hydroperoxyhexafluoro- xxxd2400xxx , thereby implementing a simple catalytic cycle. the required 5, 10␣-epoxide 6 was isolated by
column chromatography over silica gel in 49% yield as a
solid. the 11␤-(4-dimethenylaminophenyl) substituent was
introduced by sn2 opening of the oxirane ring of compound
6 with the grignard reagent prepared from 4-bromo-n,ndimethyl aniline in presence of a catalytic amount of cu (i)
iodide. the 11␤-substituted compound 7 was obtained as
solid in 77% yield. 4-bromo-n,n-dimethyl aniline was prepared [15] by the regioselective monobromination of n,ndimethylaniline with 2, 4, 4, 6-tetrabromo-2, 5-cyclohexadien [16]. 11␤ stereochemistry at c-11 is evident from the
large shielding effect in the proton resonance of the c-18
methyl group. in the 11-unsubstituted compound 6, the
18-methyl signal comes at 0.82 ppm whereas, introduction
of 11␤-aryl moiety, shields the 18-methyl signal to 0.59
ppm in compound 7. deketalization and simultaneous dehydration of 7 with 70% acoh gave the target compound 2
in 69% yield as a pale yellow crystalline solid. the structure
of compound 2 was finally confirmed by single crystal
x-ray analysis.
for the synthesis of 11␤-(acetophenyl)-17␤-hydroxy17␣-(3-methyl-1-butynyl)-estra-4, 9-dien-3-one 3, the 5,
10␣-epoxide 6 was utilized (scheme 2). 2-methyl-2-(4bromophenyl)-1, 3-dioxalan 8 was prepared from 4-bromoacetophenone by ketalization with ethylene glycol in the
presence of catalytic amount of ptsa, which in turn was
prepared from bromobenzene by fridel craft acylation with
acetic anhydride [17]. the grignard reagent prepared from
8 reacted with the 5, 10␣-epoxide 6 in sn2 mode, in presence of a catalytic amount of cui, to furnish after column
chromatographic purification the 11␤-substituted steroid 9
in 72% yield as a solid. deketalization of 9 and concomitant
dehydration with 70% acoh afforded the 11␤-(4-acetophenyl) substituted steroid 3 as a foam in 84% yield. this new
mifepristone analog 3 was fully characterized by ir, 1h
nmr, and mass and elemental analysis.
3.1. relative binding affinities of compounds 1, 2, and 3
for progesterone receptors
competitive binding assay for progesterone receptors
(pr) was performed using rabbit uterine cytosol and 3h
progesterone (radioligand) in the presence of unlabelled
cortisol at 4°c. competitor dilutions were prepared in
dmf: tris-hcl buffer ph 7.4 (1:1). results calculated as
percent relative binding affinity for pr, revealed that compound 2 was the most active. compound 1 showed rba
(103%) almost equivalent to that of progesterone (100%;
table 1). compound 2 showed an rba of 175%. compound 3 showed 35% rba that is approximately 1/5 of that
