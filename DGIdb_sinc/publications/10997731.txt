abstract in this study the functional interaction of the
antidepressant drugs amitriptyline,  xxxd2637xxx , maprotiline, imipramine, fluoxetine and the putative antidepressant drug flibanserin has been studied on  xxxg1120xxx -mediated
responses to 5-carboxamidotryptamine (5-ct) in the guineapig ileum.
5-ct induced a concentration-dependent inhibition of
the contractile response to  xxxg2240xxx  (100 nm). except
for fluoxetine and flibanserin, all the antidepressants
antagonized by different degrees the 5-ct inhibitory response with the following rank affinity order:  xxxd2637xxx  >
maprotiline ≥ imipramine > amitriptyline.  xxxd2637xxx  was
the only antidepressant to show a profile of competitive
antagonism at  xxxg1120xxx  receptors in a tenfold range of concentrations (0.1–1 µm), with an affinity (pa2) value of
8.1±0.6. the antagonism of the other antidepressants was
not concentration-dependent (amitriptyline) or was associated with slight or moderate reduction of the maximal
5-ct response (imipramine or maprotiline). the apparent
affinity (pkb) values were: amitriptyline, 7.0±0.2; maprotiline, 7.3±0.6; imipramine, 7.2±0.4.
our results show that various antidepressant drugs belonging to different chemical classes behave as antagonists at enteric  xxxg1120xxx  receptors through competitive or allosteric mechanisms. this evidence extends our previous
findings demonstrating the interaction of antidepressants
with other 5-ht receptors, namely 5-ht3 and  xxxg1117xxx  receptors.

introduction
 xxxg1120xxx  receptors have emerged as a distinct group from
the formerly classified 5-ht1-like receptors (saxena et al.
1998). they are positively coupled to adenylyl cyclase
and have been detected both in the central nervous system
and in the periphery (vanhoenacker et al. 2000). the central distribution in thalamic, limbic and cortical regions
suggests a role for these receptors in affective behaviours
(to et al. 1995; gustafson et al. 1996).
antidepressant drugs show affinity for  xxxg1120xxx  receptors
cloned from different rodents and humans, and expressed
in cellular lines. in radioligand binding studies, the tricyclic antidepressants clomipramine and amitriptyline
display affinity values between 6 and 7, whereas imipramine and desimipramine have a value below 6. a similar
value was found for the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (ssris), citalopram and fluoxetine (boess and
martin 1994). finally, the atypical antidepressant  xxxd2637xxx  has an affinity value of approximately 7 (plassat
et al. 1993; ruat et al. 1993; shen et al. 1993; to et al.
1995; jasper et al. 1997). a value of about 6 was found for
the putative antidepressant flibanserin (borsini et al.
1998). except for  xxxd2637xxx , few in vitro functional studies considered potential interactions of antidepressant drugs
with  xxxg1120xxx  receptors.
chronic treatment with fluoxetine has been found to
cause down-regulation of rat hypothalamic  xxxg1120xxx  sites
(sleight et al. 1995). conversely, in rat frontocortical astrocytes, chronic exposure to  xxxd2637xxx , amitriptyline,
maprotiline and clomipramine was reported to increase
 xxxg1120xxx -mediated activation of adenylyl cyclase, whereas
paroxetine and citalopram were ineffective (shimizu et al.
1996). recently, acute administration of several antidepressants, according to a profile consistent with activity at
 xxxg1120xxx  receptors, was shown to induce the immediate

285

early gene fos in the suprachiasmatic nucleus, an effect
which is reduced upon chronic exposure and correlates to
down-regulation of the  xxxg1120xxx  receptor (mullins et al.
1999).
in the periphery,  xxxg1120xxx  receptors have been found to
mediate the relaxant response to 5-ht in various vascular
tissues from mammals and to mediate 5-ht-induced relaxation in the guinea-pig isolated ileum and human
colonic circular smooth muscle (boess and martin 1994;
 xxxd1704xxx  et al. 1997; saxena et al. 1998; prins et al. 1999). in
this study, the functional interaction of the antidepressant
drugs amitriptyline,  xxxd2637xxx , maprotiline, imipramine
and fluoxetine and the putative antidepressant drug
flibanserin has been studied on the inhibitory response to
5-carboxamidotryptamine (5-ct), a potent  xxxg1120xxx  receptor agonist (saxena et al. 1998) in  xxxg2240xxx -contracted
ileum from the guinea pig. in this tissue, postjunctional
 xxxg1120xxx  receptors mediating 5-ht-induced relaxation have
been demonstrated by carter et al. (1995), whereas  xxxg1120xxx 
binding sites have been recognized by hemedah et al.
(1999).

materials and methods
male albino dunkin-hartley guinea-pigs (300–350 g) were killed
by co2 asphyxiation. the ileum was removed and the last 20-cm
portion, proximal to the ileo-caecal junction, was discarded.
the intestine was carefully flushed several times with warm
krebs-henseleit solution of the following composition (mm):
nacl 118, kcl 5.6,  xxxd2534xxx ×7h2o 1.19, nah2po4 1.3, nahco3
25, cacl2×6h2o 2.5 and glucose 10. the solution (ph 7.3) was
maintained at 37°c and gassed with 95% o2 and 5% co2. segments of about 3 cm in length were suspended under 1.0 g tension,
in 10-ml organ baths filled with krebs-henseleit solution. according to carter et al. (1995), the bathing medium contained the neuronal uptake blocker, cocaine (10 µm), the extraneuronal uptake
blocker, hydrocortisone (2 µm), the  xxxg1357xxx   xxxg1358xxx  inhibitor,
 xxxd2850xxx  (5 µm), the cyclooxygenase inhibitor, indomethacin
(1 µm), and the muscarine cholinoceptor antagonist, atropine (1 µm).
atropine was added to antagonize cholinergically mediated contractions due to activation of neuronal 5-ht3 and  xxxg1117xxx  receptors.
changes in tension of the tissues were recorded by mangoni isometric transducers connected to a graphtec sr 6335 polygraph.
tissues were contracted with  xxxg2240xxx  (100 nm) for 30 s, on a
10-min dose cycle. preliminary experiments had shown that this
 xxxg2240xxx  concentration elicited contractions which were approximately 80% of the maximum contraction. once stable contractions were attained (generally after 3–4 challenges), 5-ct was
added 3 min before the addition of  xxxg2240xxx  and non-cumulative concentration-response curves were constructed with 0.5-logunit increments. three minutes were sufficient for 5-ct to develop
maximal inhibition of  xxxg2240xxx -induced contraction (carter et
al. 1995).
the antidepressant drugs used were amitriptyline,  xxxd2637xxx ,
maprotiline, imipramine, fluoxetine and flibanserin, which were
tested in paired tissues. the tissues were equilibrated for 75 min
with antidepressants, at concentrations which did not affect (or
slightly affected)  xxxg2240xxx -induced contractions, before constructing concentration-response curves to 5-ct. only one concentration-response curve to 5-ct was constructed on each tissue
to avoid desensitization to this agonist.

( xxxd2115xxx ; 1,3-dihydro-1-[2-[4-[3-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl]-1-piperazinyl]ethyl]-2h-benzimidazol-2-one) was kindly donated by
boehringer ingelheim italia (milan, italy). all drugs were dissolved in distilled water except indomethacin, which was dissolved in ethanol and diluted in distilled water, and flibanserin,
which was dissolved in dmso and diluted in distilled
water/dmso to a final concentration of 0.01% dmso. drugs
were administered in volumes not exceeding 1% v/v of the bath
volume. the ethanol/water and the dmso/water solutions were
without effect on the intestinal activity.
data analysis. responses were recorded as changes in isometric
tension (g). the inhibitory responses to 5-ct were expressed as %
inhibition of  xxxg2240xxx -induced contraction. control curves were
analysed by fitting them to a logistic equation of the form: effect=emaximum/1+e(-2.303×slope×(log[a]-log[a50]), where emaximum is maximum response, [a] molar agonist concentration, [a50] (=[ec50])
molar agonist concentration inducing 50% of the maximum response. all data were fitted either to a single logistic expression or
to the sum of two logistics. goodness of fit to a single or double logistic expression was evaluated by the f-test of the residual variances using a significance criterion of p≤0.05 (sas institute inc.
1988)..agonist potency values were expressed as –log ec50, where
ec50 indicates the molar concentration of 5-ct inducing 50% of
the maximum relaxant effect. antidepressant affinity (pa2) estimates were calculated by schild regression analysis (arunlakshana
and schild 1959), using agonist concentration ratios (cr) determined at ec50 levels in the presence and in the absence of antidepressant drugs. apparent affinity (pkb) estimates from a single antidepressant concentration were calculated according to the formula: pkb=-log b+log (cr-1), where b is the antidepressant molar concentration. all data are expressed as means ± sem.

by 15%. a mean pkb value of 7.0±0.2 was calculated
from 0.3 µm amitriptyline (table 1).  xxxd2637xxx  (0.1, 0.3
and 1 µm) concentration-dependently shifted to the right
the concentration-response curve to 5-ct (fig. 2). a mean

(table 1). maprotiline (0.3 µm) shifted to the right the
concentration-response curve to 5-ct in a surmountable
manner, giving an apparent pkb value of 7.3±0.1 (table 1).
higher maprotiline concentrations (1 µm) reduced the
maximum effect of 5-ct by 31%, thus preventing the
evaluation of pkb (fig. 3). imipramine at 0.3 µm was ineffective, while at 1 µm it shifted to the right the concen-

than to a summation of two logistics. maximal inhibition
of  xxxg2240xxx -induced contraction was 34±3%. potency

amitriptyline (0.3 µm, 1 µm) shifted to the right the
concentration-response curve to 5-ct in a surmountable
manner. higher concentrations (3 µm) did not further
shift the 5-ct curve (fig. 1). at this concentration,

tration-response curve to 5-ct, yielding a mean pkb
value of 7.2±0.4 (fig. 4; table 1). higher concentrations
(3 µm) resulted in a marked (54±4%) reduction of the
maximum effect to  xxxg2240xxx . fluoxetine at 1 µm was
ineffective against 5-ct-induced relaxations (fig. 5) but
reduced  xxxg2240xxx -induced contraction by 18±2%.
higher fluoxetine concentrations (3 µm, 10 µm) reduced
(by 63±5%) or suppressed  xxxg2240xxx -induced contractions, respectively. flibanserin at 0.1 µm was without effect towards 5-ct-induced relaxations (fig. 6). higher
flibanserin concentrations (0.3–30 µm) progressively reduced  xxxg2240xxx -induced contractions up to suppression.

five antidepressant drugs, amitriptyline,  xxxd2637xxx , maprotiline, imipramine and fluoxetine, and the putative antidepressant, flibanserin, were investigated for their ability to interact with  xxxg1120xxx  receptors in the guinea-pig
ileum. except for fluoxetine and flibanserin all the other
drugs antagonized to a different extent the  xxxg1120xxx  receptor-mediated response to 5-ct. the rank order of affinity/apparent affinity in antagonizing 5-ct-induced inhibitory response was:  xxxd2637xxx  > maprotiline ≥ imipramine > amitriptyline.
 xxxd2637xxx  was the only antidepressant to show a profile of competitive antagonism at  xxxg1120xxx  receptors in a tenfold range of concentrations (0.1–1 µm), with an affinity
value of 8.1±0.6. this affinity value is similar to those
found in functional studies in the guinea-pig ileum (7.6;
 xxxd1704xxx  et al. 1997), in monkey jugular vein (7.7; leung et
al. 1996) and in the inhibition of camp accumulation in
cho-k1 cells expressing a rat  xxxg1120xxx  receptor (7.9; ruat
et al. 1993). lower pki values have been found in binding
studies at recombinant  xxxg1120xxx  receptors obtained from
mouse, rat, guinea-pig and man and expressed in cell lines
(range 7.0–7.2; plassat et al. 1993; ruat et al. 1993; shen
et al. 1993; to et al. 1995; jasper et al. 1997) and at native
central  xxxg1120xxx  receptors of the guinea pig (6.2; to et al.
1995) and rat (6.7; sleight et al. 1995).
in our experiments, the antagonism of other antidepressants was not concentration-dependent (amitriptyline)
or was associated with slight or moderate reduction of the
maximal 5-ct response (imipramine or maprotiline). the
pkb values obtained for amitriptyline (7.0) and imipramine (7.2) were higher than affinity/potency values reported in binding studies at cloned or native  xxxg1120xxx  receptors (shen et al. 1993; sleight et al. 1995). the lack of an-

288

tagonism of fluoxetine and flibanserin correlated with
their low affinity values (about 6) at  xxxg1120xxx  receptors in
binding studies (shen et al. 1993; sleight et al. 1995;
borsini et al. 1998). no data are available in the literature
for maprotiline, which in our study was found to be as potent as imipramine (pkb=7.3). amitriptyline showed a
non-competitive antagonism which may result from allosteric modulation. at variance with our results, in the rat
jejunum, where  xxxg1120xxx  receptors mediate contractile responses, fluoxetine at 1 µm exerted a non-surmountable
antagonism (mclean and coupar 1996).
it is known that under in vitro conditions chronic antidepressant exposure may enhance  xxxg1120xxx  receptor activity.
 xxxd2637xxx  (0.05–4 µm), amitriptyline (1–8 µm) and maprotiline (5 µm) enhanced camp accumulation induced
by 5-ht or 5-ct in rat frontocortical astrocytes, whereas
the ssris paroxetine and citalopram (5 µm each) were ineffective (shimizu et al. 1996). on the other hand, chronic
exposure to fluoxetine in vivo was found to down-regulate  xxxg1120xxx  binding sites in the rat hypothalamus (sleight
et al. 1995). these findings were recently confirmed by
mullins et al. (1999), who found that chronic treatment
with fluoxetine,  xxxd2637xxx  and imipramine (and other antidepressant drugs) reduced by approximately 30% the
number of  xxxg1120xxx  receptors in the rat hypothalamus, as observed in binding assays. down-regulation of  xxxg1120xxx  receptors was associated with a decrease in early gene fos
expression observed in the suprachiasmatic nucleus upon
in vivo chronic exposure to antidepressants.
although the mechanisms by which different types of
antidepressants modulate  xxxg1120xxx  receptor activity are not
known, their agonism or antagonism at the  xxxg1120xxx  receptor
may contribute to such a modulation. the action at  xxxg1120xxx 
receptors by fluoxetine,  xxxd2637xxx  and imipramine, leading to an increase in fos expression, has been demonstrated in acute experiments in vivo (mullins et al. 1999).
this effect may underlie the down-regulation of  xxxg1120xxx  receptors (with consequent decrease of fos expression) observed in chronic in vivo experiments (sleight et al. 1995;
mullins et al. 1999). the antagonistic activity of  xxxd2637xxx , maprotiline and amitriptyline at  xxxg1120xxx  receptors
may contribute to the increase in  xxxg1120xxx  receptor activity
observed by shimizu et al. (1996) in chronic in vitro experiments for these compounds.
in conclusion, our study demonstrates that some antidepressant drugs belonging to different chemical classes
behave as competitive or allosteric antagonists at enteric
 xxxg1120xxx  receptors under in vitro conditions. the present
findings extend previous evidence demonstrating the interaction of antidepressants with other 5-ht receptor
types, namely 5-ht3 and  xxxg1117xxx  receptors (lucchelli et al.
1995, 1999).
