brain 5-ht,, and 5-ht,, receptors are important targets for drug-induced modulation of 5-ht function in vivo. however,
very few compounds are available that are effective antagonists at 5-ht, receptors, thus hampering the progress of fundamental
as well as clinical research in this area. the present study assessedthe usefulness of the /i-adrenolytic agent (- i- xxxd2869xxx  (and
its (+)-counterpart) as a 5-ht,, receptor-blocking agent. the compound was found to counteract, in a stereospecific fashion,
not only the behavioural and hypothermic but also the in vivo 5-ht synthesis/ turnover-reducing effects of the specific 5-ht,,
receptor agonist s-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin (8-oh-dpat). these findings indicate that (- i- xxxd2869xxx  is an
antagonist at both postsynaptic receptors and somatodendritic autoreceptors of the 5-ht,, subtype. thus, (-)- xxxd2869xxx 
represents a useful addition to the array of pharmacological tools available for the study of central 5-ht, receptor-mediated
functions.

1. introduction
brain 5-ht,, and 5-ht,, receptors represent ‘important targets for drug-induced modulation of 5-ht
function in vivo. for example, drugs acting as agonists
or partial agonists at 5-ht,, receptors are clinically
exploited as anxiolytic (taylor, 1990, and refs. cited
therein) and possibly also antidepressive (robinson et
al., 1990) agents. however, very few compounds are
available that are effective as antagonists at 5-ht,
receptors, thus hampering the progress of fundamental
as well as clinical research in this area.
several, structurally diverse, compounds have been
proposed to be potentially useful in this context. for
example, the @-adrenoceptor blocker (- )- xxxd2957xxx ,
which additionally possesses high 5-ht,* and 5-ht,,
receptor affinity (e.g., hoyer, 1988>, is reasonably efficient as a blocker of postsynaptic 5-ht,, receptormediated responses (tricklebank et al., 1984; middlemiss et al., 1985). however, the compound is less useful
as to a tool to prevent 5-ht,, autoreceptor-mediated

reductions in 5-ht synthesis and release/ turnover (see
further discussion).
preliminary screening of other drugs with putative
5-ht,, receptor-blocking properties showed that the
p-adrenoceptor antagonist ( - )- xxxd2869xxx  efficiently
reversed the hypothermia elicited by the prototype
specific 5-ht,, receptor agonist 8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin
8-oh-dpat) (hjorth et al., 1982;
middlemiss and fozard, 1983) in the rat. the present
study was undertaken to evaluate further the usefulness of (- )- xxxd2869xxx  as a 5-ht,, receptor blocking
agent. 8-oh-dpat-induced
(i) 5-ht-like behaviour,
(ii> hypothermia, and (iii> suppression of 5-ht synthesis (5-hydroxytryptophan
(5-htp) accumulation after
decarboxylase inhibition) and turnover were used as
indices of postsynaptic 5-ht1, receptor and 5-ht,,
autoreceptor activity.

male sprague-dawley rats (250-350 g; laboratorietjhnst ab, sollentuna, sweden) were used in the
study. after arrival in the animal quarters, the rats
were housed in groups of five per cage under con-

122

trolled environmental conditions (14/10 h light/dark
cycle, lights on 05.00; ambient temp. = 24°c; humidity
= 55-60%; standard rat chow and tap water ad libiturn) for at least a week before being used in the
experiments.
2.2. dlugs

the drugs used in the studies were: (+)- and (-) xxxd2869xxx  sulphate (courtesy hoechst-roussel nordiska ab, stockholm, sweden), 3-hydroxybenzylhydrazine x hcl (nsd 1015;  xxxg618xxx  inhibitor; courtesy org. synthesis unit,
dept. pharmacol., univ. of goteborg, sweden), (*j-8hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylaminohetralin
x hbr
(8-ohdpat; rbi, natick, ma, usa), and reserpine
(courtesy ciba, basle, switzerland). reserpine was dissolved in a minimal amount of glacial acetic acid and
made up to volume with 5.5% glucose solution; other
compounds were dissolved in 0.9% saline. the drugs
were administered s.c.(&oh-dpat) or i.p. (reserpine,
 xxxd2869xxx  enantiomers and nsd 1015) in a volume of
5 ml/kg rat weight.
2.3. experimental protocol
2.3.1. behaviour

animals pretreated with reserpine (5 mg/kg i.p., 18
h prior to the experiments), were put into individual
plastic cages (l x w x h = 32 x 32 x 14 cm) 5 min before the behavioural studies started. vehicle or different doses of the enantiomers of  xxxd2869xxx  were injected i.p. and, 30 min later, all rats were given 8-ohdpat (0.3 mg/kg s.c.). the animals were scored by an
observer unaware of the treatment(s), for forepaw
treading and flat-body posture - components of the
“5-ht syndrome” - using an intensity-based rating
scale similar to that used by tricklebank et al. (19841,
where 0 = absent, 1 = equivocal, 2 = definite and 3 =
intense (see hjorth et al., 1989; hjorth and sharp,
1990). the behavioural ratings represent 1-min observation “windows”: once immediately before 8-ohdpat treatment, and then at 5, 10 and 15 min thereafter (= 35, 40 and ,45 min after  xxxd2869xxx  injection).
the maximum summed score 5-15 min after 8-ohdpat treatment was nine per behavioural item, i.e.,
totalling 18 for the whole observation session. the
experimental data are expressed as percentages of the
maximum possible scores.

connected to a digital thermometer (ysi, model 45ta)
from which the readings were taken approximately
45-60 s after insertion of the probe. different doses of
the  xxxd2869xxx  isomers were given 30 min before 8oh-dpat (0.1 mg/kg s.c.). the temperature readings
were taken immediately before  xxxd2869xxx  injection, 30
min thereafter (= at the time of 8-oh-dpat injection), and finally, 60 min after  xxxd2869xxx . ambient
temperature during the experiments was 21-23°c. six
separate experimental sessions were carried out. the
data were normalized by calculating the absolute difference (in ‘c> pre- vs. post-8-oh-dpat
injection in
all treatment groups. the results were subsequently
expressed as % reversal of the corresponding mean
8-oh-dpat control response according to the formula:
(s-oh-dpat control response)
- ( xxxd2869xxx /s-oh-dpat
value) x looo/
(8-oh-dpat control response)
”

2.3.3. biochemistry

after the different drug treatments, the animals
were killed by decapitation and their brains were
rapidly taken out for dissection on an ice-cooled petri
dish. the dissection procedure was as described by
carlsson and lindqvist (19731, yielding limbic forebrain
(containing, i.a., the accumbens nuclei, olfactory tubercles, septal and amygdaloid areas), corpora striata and
the remaining “hemispheral” (mainly cortex) portions
of the rate cerebrum. tissue levels of 5-ht, 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-hiaa) and 5-htp were determined by means of hplc (electrochemical detection),
essentially according to standard methodology (magnusson et al., 1980; shum et al., 1982). the biochemical
results are given in rig/g tissue weight.
2.4. statistics

statistical comparisons of the experimental data
were made by using a one-way anova followed by
fisher’s protected least-significant
difference test
(pi-sd), or (behavioural data) by means of kruskalwallis anova followed by the mann-whitney u-test.
probability levels of 5% or less were considered statistically significant.

4. discussion
the present data provide functional evidence that
the /?-adrenoceptor antagonist ( - )- xxxd2869xxx  is also
an efficacious and stereospecific 5-ht,,
receptor
blocker in the rat central nervous system (cns). the
compound was found to counteract not only the behavioural and hypothermic but also the in vivo 5-ht
synthesis-reducing effects of the specific 5-ht,, receptor agonist 8-oh-dpat. these findings thus indicate
that (-)- xxxd2869xxx 
is an antagonist at both postsynaptic receptors and somatodendritic autoreceptors of
the 5-ht,, subtype.
( - )- xxxd2869xxx  appears comparable to ( - )- xxxd2957xxx 
as a stereospecific postsynaptic 5-ht,, receptor-blocking agent. thus, as previously described for the latter
(tricklebank et al., 1984; middlemiss et al., 19851,
( - )- xxxd2869xxx  fully and dose dependently antagonized the flattened body posture and forepaw treading
elicited by 8-oh-dpat in reserpinized rats (fig. 1) and
the hypothermia caused by the 5-ht,, receptor agonist in normal rats (fig. 2), both responses being considered to reflect the direct activation of postsynaptic
5-ht,, receptors (hjorth et al., 1982; tricklebank et
al., 1984; hjorth 1985; bjll et al., 1991). also, like the
(+)-enantiomer
of  xxxd2957xxx  (tricklebank et al., 1984;
middlemiss et al., 1985), (+ )- xxxd2869xxx  had no significant effect on the 8-oh-dpat-induced
actions in either of these two experimental models. in addition,
racemic  xxxd2869xxx  was recently reported to concentration dependently antagonize 8-oh-dpat-induced
inhibition of  xxxd1742xxx -stimulated
adenylate cyclase in rat
hippocampal membranes, an in vitro index of postsynaptic 5-ht,, receptor function (hamon et al., 1990).
both 5-ht,, and 5-ht,, (auto)receptors participate
in the control of central 5-ht neuronal activity in rats
(e.g., engel et al., 1986; aghajanian et al., 1987). 8oh-dpat is believed to decrease forebrain 5-ht synthesis and release via activation of the somatodendritic,
nerve-impulse controlling, 5-ht,, autoreceptors in the
midbrain raphe (hamon et al., 1988; hjorth and magnusson 1988; sharp et al., 1989; sharp and hjorth,
1990). 8-oh-dpat-mediated
5-ht,, autoreceptor activation has, however, proven difficult to block by means
of putative 5-i-it,, receptor antagonists. the reasons
for this are (at least) two-fold: firstly, some of the
compounds used for the purpose are in fact better
described as mixed agonist/ antagonists at 5-ht,,,,,
receptors (cf. below), and secondly, 5-ht,, autoreceptors seem to have a higher agonist responsiveness than
postsynaptic 5-ht,, receptors (sprouse and aghaja-

nian, 1988; hjorth et al., 1990; hjorth and sharp,
1990), possibly as a result of a greater receptor “reserve”, higher sensitivity and/or more efficient transduction mechanisms (sharp and hjorth, 1990; meller
et al., 1991).
(-)- xxxd2957xxx 
is one of the most frequently used
putative 5-ht,, receptor antagonists (e.g., tricklebank
et al., 1984; middlemiss et al., 1985). the compound is
an efficient antagonist of postsynaptic 5-ht,, receptor-mediated responses, and is also useful as a blocker
of 5-ht,, autoreceptors but only if a higher enough
antagonist-to-agonist
concentration
ratio can be
achieved (cf. sharp and hjorth, 1990). however, in
..
addition to 5-ht,, (and p-adrenoceptor)
receptorblocking effects, this agent has affinity for 5-ht,,
receptors (hoyer, 1988) and may possess (partial?)
agonist properties at these latter sites. thus, (-) xxxd2957xxx  per se decreases in vivo 5-ht synthesis and
turnover (hjorth and carlsson, 19861, possibly by the
activation of 5-ht,, autoreceptors. the compound has
also been reported to mimic the internal cue produced
by the 5-ht,, receptor agonist tfmpp in drug discrimination studies (glennon et al., 1988b).
a number of other compounds, mainly from the
buspirone family (e.g., bmy 7378, nan-190, mdl
73005ef), have also been proposed as 5-ht,, receptor
antagonists (glennon et al., 1988a; hibert et al., 1988;
yocca et al., 1988). however, subsequent work has
demonstrated that these agents possess mixed 5-ht,,
receptor agonist/ antagonist properties, with agonist
qualities predominating at somatodendritic vs. postsynaptic 5-ht,, sites (gartside et al., 1990; hjorth and
sharp, 1990; moser et al., 1990; sharp et al., 1990;
further discussed in sharp and hjorth, 1990).
as is evident from the above, the use of the aforementioned agents as blockers of the 8-oh-dpat-induced suppression of 5-ht synthesis and release/
turnover is limited. although the present data are
consistent with the view that (-)- xxxd2869xxx 
is a less
than full antagonist (cf. tables l-3), it should be noted
that its 5-ht synthesis-decreasing effect, when given
alone, was very weak by comparison (approximately a
third of the maximum response to (-)- xxxd2957xxx 
or
8-oh-dpat, cf. hjorth et al., 1982; hjorth and carlsson, 1986), suggesting relatively minor 5-ht autoreceptor agonist efficacy.
the (- )- xxxd2869xxx -induced
reversal of the biochemical effects of 8-oh-dpat can be adequately
explained by 5-ht,, autoreceptor blockade, but might
additionally involve disinhibition of presynaptic feedback of 5-ht synthesis as a consequence of 5-ht,,
autoreceptor antagonism. according to preliminary radioligand binding studies, (- )- xxxd2869xxx  exhibits high
affinity for both 5-ht,,
and 5-ht,,
receptors
(boaventura et al., 1987; hall and ross, unpublished
data) and, for example, the putative &adrenoceptor/

126

sht,,
receptor antagonist isamoltane may cause a
modest acceleration of 5-ht synthesis and turnover
indices in rat brain (waldmeier et al., 1988; rcnyi et
al., 1991). in contrast, as noted above, (- )- xxxd2869xxx 
did not stimulate 5-ht synthesis or turnover when
given alone. moreover, the s-ht synthesis-inhibitory
response to 8-oh-dpat was also antagonized in reserpinized (monoamine-depleted)
rats (table 21, which
in all probability lack sht,,
receptor tone. thus,
while a 5-ht,,-blocking
component cannot be excluded from the action spectrum of (- )- xxxd2869xxx  in
normal rats, the results indicate that 5-ht,, autoreceptor antagonism plays a prominent role in the mechanism of action of the compound.
it appears unlikely that the ( - )- xxxd2869xxx -induced
antagonism of 8-oh-dpat responses results from /3adrenoceptor interaction. thus, pi- and &-adrenoceptor-selective agents lacking affinity for 5-ht,, sites fail
to block 8-oh-dpat-induced
behavioural and hypothermic actions (e.g., tricklebank et al., 1984; middlemiss et al., 1985). since neither of the  xxxd2869xxx 
enantiomers appreciably affected brain tryptophan
concentrations, changes in central 5-ht metabolism
secondary to altered precursor levels are a less likely
explanation of the present findings.
theoretically, the cardiovascular actions of p-adrenoceptor blockers like (- )- xxxd2869xxx  and ( - )- xxxd2957xxx 
might alter the pharrnacokinetics of 8-oh-dpat, and
thereby, in turn, result in apparent antagonism of the
pharmacological responses elicited by the 5-ht,, receptor agonist. however, while this possibility has not
been specifically investigated for (- )- xxxd2869xxx , it has
been shown that neither brain nor plasma levels of
8-oh-dpat are significantly altered by  xxxd2957xxx  at
doses sufficient to block the 5-ht,, receptor-mediated
functional actions of the agonist (perry and fuller,
1989).
in summary, the present study demonstrates that
(- )- xxxd2869xxx  possesses clear-cut pre- and postsynaptic 5-ht,, receptor-blocking properties. moreover, the
compound appears to compare favourably to previously
described 5+it,/&adrenoceptor
blockers, such as
(- )- xxxd2957xxx , by virtue of its relative lack of 5-ht
(5-ht,, and/or 5-i-e’,,) autoreceptor agonist effects.
given the paucity of 5-ht, receptor blockers, the data
suggest that (- )- xxxd2869xxx  represents a useful addition to the array of pharmacological tools available for
the study of central 5-ht, receptor-mediated
functions.
