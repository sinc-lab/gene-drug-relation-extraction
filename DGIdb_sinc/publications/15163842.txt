a bstract
dual inhibition of  xxxg682xxx -1 (egfr) and  xxxg682xxx -2
(her-2) tyrosine kinases has been found to exert
greater biologic effects in the inhibition of signaling
pathways promoting cancer cell proliferation and survival than inhibition of either receptor alone. the novel
dual egfr/ xxxg682xxx -2  xxxg2198xxx  inhibitor lapatinib
(glaxosmithkline; research triangle park, nc) has
been shown to inhibit tumor cell growth in vitro and in
xenograft models for a variety of human tumors.
preliminary findings in a phase i study of lapatinib in
patients with solid tumors indicate doses up to 1,800 mg
per day are well tolerated. no grade 4 toxicities were
observed and only two of 43 patients had grade 3 toxicity (diarrhea). clinical activity of lapatinib was
observed in these patients; nine patients with a variety

of tumors remained on study for ≥4 months, one with a
complete response (head and neck cancer). in a phase
ib study in pretreated metastatic cancer patients with
disease that could be biopsied, grade 1 or 2 diarrhea and
rash were the most common adverse events. three
patients with breast cancer refractory to trastuzumab
(herceptin®; genentech, inc.; south san francisco, ca)
had partial responses and 12 patients with a variety of
tumors had stable disease. assessment of biologic correlates in these patients indicates that increased tumor cell
apoptosis on the terminal deoxynucleotide transferasemediated dutp nick-end labeling assay correlates with
clinical response. lapatinib currently is being evaluated
in phase ii and phase iii trials in patients with metastatic
breast cancer. the oncologist 2004;9(suppl 3):10-15

ization, resulting in receptor autophosphorylation and activation;
 xxxg682xxx -2 (her-2) has no known ligands but is a heterodimerization
partner for egfr and other members of the  xxxg682xxx  receptor family,
with transactivation of  xxxg682xxx -2
occurring following heterodimerization. autophosphorylation activates receptor tks, resulting in
activation of signaling pathways
involved in cell proliferation,
survival, and transformation,
including the well-characterized
mitogen-activated protein kinase
(mapk) ( xxxg1369xxx /2) and phosphatidylinositol 3′ kinase (pi3k)/akt pathways (fig. 1) [13]. overexpression or constitutive activation of the egfr or
 xxxg682xxx -2 receptors results in cell transformation and is associated with poor clinical outcome in a number of malignancies
[4, 5]. the potential roles of the egfr and  xxxg682xxx -2 receptors
in tumor cell proliferation and survival have prompted the
development of monoclonal antibodies that inhibit the receptor and agents that inhibit receptor tks; for example, cetuximab (erbitux®; imclone systems, inc.; new york, ny) and
trastuzumab (herceptin®; genentech, inc.; south san
francisco, ca) are monoclonal antibodies to the  xxxg682xxx -1 and
 xxxg682xxx -2 receptors, respectively, and gefitinib (iressa®;
astrazeneca pharmaceuticals; wilmington, de) inhibits the
 xxxg682xxx -1 tk. there is considerable rationale for combined
receptor/kinase inhibition, including the potential for overcoming redundancy in cell signaling pathways with the use
of broader inhibition and the potential application to a wider
range of patients based on epidemiologic evidence implicating egfr and  xxxg682xxx -2 receptors in a variety of tumor types.
lapatinib (glaxosmithkline; research triangle park, nc) is
a novel dual egfr/ xxxg682xxx -2 tk inhibitor that has shown
promising activity in preclinical and early clinical investigations, providing support for a dual inhibitor approach in cancer therapy.
lapatinib properties
part of the rationale for the development of lapatinib was
provided by preclinical findings of synergistic cell growth
inhibition with simultaneous targeting of egfr and  xxxg682xxx -2
receptor tks. for example, treatment with the  xxxg682xxx -1 tk

inhibitor gefitinib plus the anti- xxxg682xxx -2 (her-2) receptor
monoclonal antibody trastuzumab produced a greater apoptotic effect than either inhibitor alone in the  xxxg682xxx -2-overexpressing breast cancer cell lines skbr-3 and bt-474 [6].
lapatinib was shown to exhibit greater growth inhibition of
colon cancer cells activated by the egfr ligand transforming
growth factor alpha (tgf-alpha) than antagonists targeting either
egfr or  xxxg682xxx -2 alone [7].
lapatinib is a large head group quinazoline, distinguishing it from the small head group quinazolines  xxxd2029xxx  and
gefitinib. it demonstrates high cell potency (50% inhibitory
concentration <0.2 µm), has been shown to inhibit egfr and
 xxxg682xxx -2 phosphorylated (phospho)-tyrosine, phospho- xxxg1369xxx /2,
phospho-akt, and cyclin d in tumor cell lines and xenograft
models, and has been shown to be efficacious in inhibiting
cell growth in xenograft models [8, 9]. the drug exhibited a
favorable toxicity profile in rodents and dogs and no evidence
of cardiac toxicity during high exposure over 6 and 9 months,
respectively.
phase i studies of lapatinib
oral lapatinib was administered to 135 healthy volunteers
in four studies at doses of 10-250 mg and was found to be safe
and well tolerated. in phase i studies in cancer patients, the
drug was administered at doses of 175-1,800 mg once daily or
500-900 mg twice daily (bid) in 92 patients, with no significant toxicities observed to date. pharmacokinetic data from
these studies are under analysis; pharmacodynamic data
derived from skin biopsies and buccal smears taken in all
phase i patients are also being analyzed.

assess food effect (n = 6), 500 mg bid (n = 13), and 750 mg
bid (n = 22). preliminary data in 43 of those patients indicate no grade 4 toxicities; most toxicities were grade 1 or 2,
with two cases of grade 3 diarrhea observed at the 900-mg
bid dose level (table 1 and table 2). rash, diarrhea, nausea, and fatigue were the most common adverse events.
some evidence of clinical activity has been observed. as
shown in table 3, patients with a variety of tumors have
had stable disease for up to 13 months; one patient exhibited a minor response, and one patient with a head and neck
tumor had a complete response and remained on study after
19 months. preliminary pharmacokinetic data indicate that
the lapatinib serum concentrations were above the in vitro
90% inhibitory concentration at the 1,200-mg once-daily
dose, and pharmacokinetics appear to be linear over the
tested dose range (up to 1,800 mg).

breast cancer (n = 7), colorectal cancer (n = 2), ovarian cancer (n = 2), lung cancer (n = 1), adenocarcinoma of unknown
primary site (n = 1), granular cell carcinoma (n = 1), and head
and neck cancer (n = 1).
biologic correlates in a patient (patient a) with
trastuzumab-refractory inflammatory breast cancer who had a
rather dramatic partial response to lapatinib are shown in
table 4. that patient had received previous adjuvant therapy, hormonal therapy, and chemotherapy in addition to
trastuzumab. decreases in phospho- xxxg682xxx -1 and phosphoerbb-2, phospho-erk index, cyclin d, and tgf-alpha were
observed, with a dramatic increase in tumor cell apoptosis
using the terminal deoxynucleotide transferase-mediated
dutp nick-end labeling (tunel) assay. patient b also
exhibited a partial response to lapatinib after progression of
metastatic breast cancer following treatments with paclitaxel, carboplatin, and trastuzumab, and with vinorelbine
and trastuzumab. biologic correlates in that patient also
indicate a marked increase in apoptosis on the tunel
assay (table 4). in contrast, correlates in a patient (patient
c) with progressive disease on lapatinib after failing two
previous courses of chemotherapy plus trastuzumab indicate
an absence of effect on apoptosis. in patients assessed thus
far, clinical responses have been observed only in those with
a positive effect on the tunel assay. the prognostic utility of the other correlates is currently being evaluated.
figure 2 shows that a ≥75% inhibition of phospho- xxxg682xxx -1,
phospho- xxxg682xxx -2, phospho- xxxg1369xxx /2, or phospho-akt expression was reliably achieved at lapatinib doses of 650 mg
and greater.

 xxxg682xxx -2 receptors on immunohistochemistry [11]. patients
are randomized to receive lapatinib at doses of 500, 650,
900, 1,200, or 1,600 mg once daily. the biologic consequences of treatment on growth and survival pathways are
being assessed in tumor biopsy samples obtained prior to
and 21 days after the start of treatment, and safety and clinical activity are being evaluated. thus far, 33 patients have
been entered in the study, seven at the 500-mg dose, eight
at the 650-mg dose, five at the 900-mg dose, six at the
1,200-mg dose, and seven at the 1,600-mg dose; tumor
types in these patients consist of breast cancer (33%), ovarian cancer (15%), head and neck cancer (12%), adenocarcinoma of unknown primary site (12%), colorectal cancer
(12%), lung cancer (6%), and others (9%). treatment has
been well tolerated, with no grade 4 and one grade 3 toxicity
(gastroesophageal reflux). the most common adverse events
(all grade 1 or 2) have been diarrhea (27%), rash (25%), and
nausea/vomiting (21%). no treatment-related cardiac or pulmonary toxicity has been observed. partial responses were
observed in three patients (10%) at the 1,200-mg (n = 2) and
900-mg (n = 1) doses, with those patients having received
therapy for a median of 23 weeks (20 to >25 weeks). each of
the three patients had breast cancer and exhibited both egfr
and  xxxg682xxx -2 overexpression. stable disease was observed in
12 patients (36%) at the 500-mg (n = 4), 650-mg (n = 3), 900mg (n = 1), 1,200-mg (n = 2), and 1,600 mg (n = 2) doses,
with a median treatment duration of 19 weeks (14 to >34
weeks) in those patients. of the 12 patients, 10 had egfr
overexpression and six had  xxxg682xxx -2 overexpression, including
all breast cancer patients with stable disease. overall, the

expression in tumors at day 21 compared with baseline according to
lapatinib dose in study egf10004.

in summary, preliminary findings from the egf10003
trial indicate that lapatinib was well tolerated at all doses
tested. clinical responses were observed at a variety of doses
in these heavily pretreated patients with metastatic disease.
partial responses were observed in  xxxg682xxx -2-expressing breast
cancer that had progressed on previous trastuzumab-containing regimens, and disease stabilization was observed in
patients with a variety of other tumor types. lapatinib inhibited signaling pathways implicated in tumor growth and survival. data in this regard suggest that, although inhibition of
phospho- xxxg1369xxx /2, phospho-akt, or cyclin d may be necessary for clinically detectable antitumor effects, they are not
sufficient for producing such effects; induction of tumor cell
apoptosis, as reflected in tunel assay measurements,
appeared to correlate with clinical response.
ongoing studies of lapatinib in advanced
breast cancer
the activity of lapatinib against breast cancer in preclinical models and its safety and activity in initial clinical experience have prompted the initiation of phase ii and phase iii
trials in the setting of advanced breast cancer. in an openlabel, multicenter, single-arm phase ii trial (egf20002/
egf20008), lapatinib is to be used as single-agent therapy in
patients with advanced or metastatic breast cancer who pro-

gressed while receiving trastuzumab-containing regimens. a
phase iii randomized, open-label, multicenter trial
(egf100151) is comparing lapatinib plus  xxxd425xxx  with
 xxxd425xxx  alone in patients with refractory advanced or
metastatic breast cancer. egf30001 is a randomized, doubleblind, placebo-controlled, two-arm, multicenter phase iii
trial of lapatinib plus paclitaxel versus paclitaxel alone in
previously untreated patients with advanced or metastatic
disease. egf30008 is a randomized, double-blind, placebocontrolled, multicenter phase iii trial comparing lapatinib
plus letrozole with letrozole alone in patients with estrogen/progesterone-receptor-positive advanced metastatic
breast cancer. findings in these trials should help to clarify
the potential roles of this new dual egfr/ xxxg682xxx -2 inhibitor in
the treatment of advanced breast cancer.
conclusion
lapatinib is a novel dual egfr/ xxxg682xxx -2 receptor tk
inhibitor being studied in patients with advanced and
metastatic cancer. phase i data indicate good tolerability,
with grade 1 or 2 rash and gastrointestinal effects being the
most common observed toxicities, and evidence of clinical
activity in patients with a variety of tumor types. phase ii and
iii trials have been initiated in patients with advanced breast
cancer to assess lapatinib used alone or combined with agents
such as  xxxd425xxx , a taxane, or hormonal therapy, and
include previously treated and untreated patients.
preliminary assessment of biologic correlates in patients
treated with lapatinib suggests that induction of tumor cell
apoptosis as measured by the tunel assay correlates with
clinical response.
