abstract ezetimibe is a selective acyl- xxxd1739xxx :
cholesterol acyltransferase (acat) inhibitor used in
hypercholesterolemia. synthesis of ezetimibe requires
enantiopure 3-[5-(4-fluorophenyl)-5(s)-hydroxypentanoyl]4(s)-4-phenyl-1,3- xxxd2815xxx -2-one (fop alcohol) as a
crucial intermediate which is produced by reduction of the
corresponding prochiral ketone (fop dione). a new biocatalyst from acclimatized soil was screened for bioreduction of the above prochiral ketone. the microorganism
was identified by 16s mrna sequencing, as burkholderia
cenocepacia. various physicochemical conditions were
optimized to increase cellmass and enzyme activity. the
overall increase in cellmass concentration and enzyme
activity was 2.06 and 1.85-fold, respectively. various
reaction conditions, for example ph, temperature, agitation, and cellmass concentration, were optimized for
maximum product yield (chiral alcohol) with excellent
enantioselectivity. best reduction was achieved in phosphate
buffer (50 mm, ph 8.0) at 40°c (200 rpm) and the yield of
enantiopure alcohol from the corresponding prochiral ketone
was 54%. this biocatalyst was also used for the reduction of
various other prochiral ketones.

introduction
chiral alcohols are used as important building blocks in the
synthesis of pharmaceuticals with high enantiomeric purity
[1]. application of microbial dehydrogenases for reduction
of ketones to the corresponding chiral alcohols has gained
popularity over chemical routes [2]. higher chemo, enantio, and regio selectivity of these enzymes have provided
opportunities for development of novel chemical synthesis.
therefore, current research in enantioselective bioreduction is gaining momentum toward the development of less
expensive, more efficient, and scalable strategies for synthesis of chiral intermediates. several bioreductions have
been reported for synthesis of chiral drugs and drug
intermediates [3].
ezetimibe (sch 58235, 1-(4-fluorophenyl)-3-(r)-[3-(4fluorophenyl)-3-(s)-hydroxypropyl]-4-(s)-(4-hydroxyphenyl)2-azetidinone), a selective inhibitor of acyl- xxxd1739xxx :
cholesterol acyltransferase (acat), reduces plasma ldl
cholesterol level and increases plasma hdl level [4–6].
synthesis of ezetimibe involves reduction of 1-(4-fluorophenyl)-5-(2-oxo-4-phenyl- xxxd2815xxx -3-yl)-pentane-1,5dione (fop dione) to crucial homochiral intermediate
3-[5-(4-fluorophenyl)-5-(s)-hydroxypentanoyl]-4(s)-4-phenyl-1,3- xxxd2815xxx -2-one (fop alcohol), which is further
processed to synthesize ezetimibe (fig. 1) [7, 8]. enantioselective reduction of fop dione to (s)-fop alcohol has been
achieved mainly by use of chemical catalysts, usually with
chiral boron catalysts [9, 10]. one of the main drawbacks of
the chemical synthetic strategy is the formation of the diol
by-product which is difficult to separate because of its
instability. moreover, these boron catalysts are less enantioselective (\99%) and are costly, non-degradable, and
hence pose a threat to the environment. oxidoreductases may
be better alternatives, because of their high selectivity, their

stability toward molecular oxygen, the absence of side
reaction, and the mild operation conditions required. only
one microbial catalyst has been reported for this reduction—
use of schizosaccharomyces octosporus atcc 2479, for
which product yield is 33% [11]. we have isolated and
screened various microbial cultures for reduction of fop
dione to (s)-fop alcohol with high enantiomeric excess and
found burkholderia cenocepacia to be the best catalyst.
further the enzyme activity of the catalyst was improved by
optimizing various environmental and nutritional conditions. this paper reports the bioreduction of fop dione to
(s)-fop alcohol, an intermediate for ezetimibe synthesis
using b. cenocepacia as biocatalyst. various other ketones,
for example acetophenone and 40 -halo-substituted acetophenones, were also reduced using b. cenocepacia.

materials and methods
chemicals
fop dione was a kind gift from ind-swift pharmaceutical
(chandigarh, india). growth media components were
procured from hi-media (mumbai, india). solvents used
for hplc were purchased from mallinckrodt baker
(phillipsburg, usa). inorganic and buffer salts were
obtained from qualigens (mumbai, india). all other
chemicals used were of analytical grade and obtained from
standard companies. racemic fop alcohol was synthesized by reduction of fop dione by bh3:thf in dichloromethane solvent. authentic (s)-fop alcohol (ee 67%) was
prepared by chemical reduction of fop dione, as reported
in the literature [9].

microorganisms and growth medium
using the soil acclimatization technique, morphologically
different cultures were isolated from soil and grown in
minimum salt media (msm) containing the substrate (fop
dione). cultures which showed good growth in msm media
were selected and screened for the bioreduction of the
ketone. each culture was grown in nutrient broth containing
(g l-1): peptone, 5; yeast extract, 1.5; beef extract, 1.5; and
nacl, 5, at 30°c for 24 h. cells were harvested by centrifugation, washed with distilled water and cell suspension of
200 mg  xxxg1167xxx  was prepared in phosphate buffer (ph 7.0)
and used for bioreduction of fop dione. aliquots of 1 ml
were withdrawn at 2-h intervals and extracted with ethyl
acetate. the organic layer was separated, dried by rotary
evaporation, and analyzed by hplc. various environmental (time of growth, temperature, medium ph, agitation
rate, etc.) and nutritional (carbon source, nitrogen source,
metal ions, inducers, etc.) conditions were optimized to
increase the cellmass concentration and enzyme activity of
b. cenocepacia.
analytical procedures
quantitative bioreduction of ketone was estimated by highperformance liquid chromatography (hplc) using a c18
column (4.0 mm 9 250 mm, 5 lm, waters, the netherlands). for fop dione and fop alcohol the mobile phase
was 55:45 acetonitrile–sodium biphosphate buffer, ph 4.0,
at a flow rate of 1 ml min-1; the eluent was monitored at
215 nm. the product alcohol and substrate ketone were
eluted at 8.1 and 13.6 min, respectively. for acetophenones
and 40 -haloacetophenones the mobile phase was 50:50

j ind microbiol biotechnol (2009) 36:1369–1374

acetonitrile–water and absorbance was monitored at
205 nm.
the purity of the product alcohol was determined by use
of a chiralcel od-h column (0.46 mm 9 250 mm, 5 lm,
diacel chemical industries, new jersey, usa). for fop
alcohol the mobile phase was 75:25 hexane containing
0.1% trifluoroacetic acid– xxxd102xxx  at a flow rate of
0.5 ml min-1. absorbance was monitored at 215 nm. the
(s) and (r)-alcohols were eluted at 24.27 and 27.34 min,
respectively. a 90:10 mixture of hexane and isopropyl
alcohol was used as mobile phase to check the purity of
phenyl ethanols.
enzyme assay
carbonyl reductase activity was measured by reduction of
40 -fluoroacetophenone using whole cells of b. cenocepacia.
the reduced product (alcohol) was measured by hplc on a
c18 column. the reaction mixture (5 ml) contained 1 g wet
cell mass, 40 -fluoroacetophenone (2 mm) as substrate in
phosphate buffer (50 mm, ph 8). the reaction mixture was
incubated at 35°c for 4 h (200 rpm) and then centrifuged to
remove the cellmass. the aqueous layer was extracted with
ethyl acetate, dried by rotary evaporation, and analyzed by
hplc. one unit of enzyme activity was defined as the
amount of enzyme that reduced 1 lmol 40 -fluoroacetophenone per minute under standard assay conditions.

min g) 9 5 9 10-3]. beyond this ph, both cellmass and
enzyme activity decreased. the effect of temperature on
growth and enzyme activity was examined by growing the
microorganism at different temperatures ranging from 20
to 40°c. maximum cellmass (5.62 ± 0.102 g l-1) and
enzyme activity [3.20 ± 0.024 (lmol/min g) 9 5 9 10-3]
were obtained at 35°c. both above and below this
temperature, cellmass and enzyme activity decreased. to
study the effect of mixing on growth of, and enzyme production by, b. cenocepacia, the culture was incubated
(35°c) at different shaking speeds (150, 175, 200, 225,
250 rpm). it was observed that both growth and enzyme
activity increased as the shaking speed was increased to
200 rpm; thereafter it decreased. the maximum cellmass
(8.17 ± 0.283 g l-1) and enzyme activity [4.58 ± 0.008
(lmol/min g) 9 5 9 10-3] were observed at 200 rpm.
effect of carbon source
both inorganic (sodium succinate, sodium citrate, sodium
potassium tartrate, etc.) and organic (glucose, fructose,
fructose, mannitol, sorbitol, glycerol, lactose, etc.) carbon
sources were tried (10 g l-1) to increase the cellmass and
enzyme activity of b. cenocepacia. sucrose, fructose, and
mannitol increased cellmass production whereas other
carbon sources had no effect on growth. however, most of
the carbon sources, except sodium citrate and sodium
succinate, improved enzyme activity (table 1). maximum

results and discussion
from the acclimatized soil, 89 morphologically different
cultures were isolated. among these, strain no. 20 was
found to be most suitable for bioreduction because it gave
best conversion (46%) with excellent enantioselectivity
([99%). strain no. 20 was identified and characterized as
burkholderia cenocepacia by 16s mrna sequencing in
microbial type culture collection and gene bank, at the
institute of microbial technology, chandigarh, india, and
was given the accession no. mtcc 5427.
effect of environmental and nutritional conditions
on growth and enzyme production
the effect of physicochemical conditions on growth and
enzyme production was studied in nutrient broth medium.
inoculum of age 12 h (5% v/v) and growth time 10 h was
optimum for enzyme production. it was found that the
b. cenocepacia was able to grow and produced sufficient
enzyme through a broad range of ph (5–10). however,
maximum cellmass and enzyme activity was obtained
when the initial ph of the medium was set at 8 [cellmass

(data not shown).
effect of nitrogen source
the effect of different organic and inorganic nitrogen
sources (beef extract, meat extract, yeast extract, peptone,
soyapeptone, tryptone, ammonium sulfate, ammonium
chloride, ammonium nitrate and urea) was examined for
the cellmass and carbonyl reductase production at a final
concentration of 5 g l-1. no cell growth was observed in
production media containing inorganic nitrogen sources
except ammonium sulfate, for which cell growth was
observed, but less than in medium without nitrogen source
(control). all organic nitrogen sources supported cellmass
production; the maximum was observed with tryptone
(8.70 ± 0.57 g l-1); enzyme activity did not improve over
control, however (table 2). hence no extra nitrogen source
was added to the medium.

enzyme production was studied by adding the metal ions in
the medium separately (final concentration 1 mm)
(table 3). cu2?, zn2? and k? did not support cellmass
production and had an inhibitory effect on enzyme activity.
ca2? and mg2? had a very mild effect whereas ni? was
detrimental for both the cellmass production and enzyme
activity. fe3? was favourable for growth (11.56 ±
0.864 g l-1) and enzyme activity [5.82 ± 0.028 (lmol/
min g) 9 5 9 10-3] and selected as a medium component.
further, optimization of fe3? concentration revealed that
1.2 mm was optimum for enzyme production [5.92 ±
0.058 (lmol/min g) 9 5 9 10-3] by b. cenocepacia (data
not shown). to further enhance enzyme activity, various
inducers (40 -fluoroacetophenone, acetophenone, 40 -chloroacetophenone, fop dione, acetone, etc.) were also tried in
the medium (1 mm). no significant change in enzyme
activity was observed with inducers, indicating noninducible nature of the enzyme (data not shown).
reduction of fop dione
effect of ph
in order to discover the optimum ph for bioreduction of
fop dione, cells of b. cenocepacia were suspended
(200 mg  xxxg1167xxx ) in acetate, phosphate, and  xxxd3449xxx  of different ph ranging from 5.0 to 10.0. it was observed that good
conversion and ee was obtained in the ph range 7.0–9.0,
beyond that ph range % conversion decreased (fig. 2).
because there is no ionizable group in fop dione, it
was probably unaffected by the change in ph. the ph range

the effect of temperature on the bioreduction was examined by setting up reaction at a temperatures ranging from
25 to 50°c. percentage bioreduction increased with
increasing temperature up to 40°c, thereafter, it decreased
(fig. 3). the increase may be because of increased solubility of the substrate at higher temperature and greater
availability of the substrate (fop dione) to the microbial
cells. this increased the rate of enzymatic reaction. it was
also found that a temperature of 35–37°c was most
favourable for the growth and enzyme production by
b. cenocepacia. above 40°c, enzyme inactivation resulted
in less bioreduction.

7.0–9.0 may be more favourable for b. cenocepacia cells,
hence good reduction was observed in this ph range only.
because growth of and enzyme production by b. cenocepacia

effect of mixing
mass-transfer plays a significant role in biotransformation
reaction. an adequate rate of agitation ensures proper mass
transfer in the biocatalytic reaction. the optimum rate of
agitation for bioreduction of fop dione by b. cenocepacia
was determined by setting up reactions at different agitation rates (150, 175, 200, 225, 250 rpm). product concentration increased with increasing mixing up to 200 rpm,
thereafter; it decreased (fig. 4). the enantioselectivity of
the bioreduction reaction remained unchanged ([99%) in
all the experiments.
effect of cellmass concentration
reactions with different cell concentrations (150, 200, 250,
300 mg  xxxg1167xxx ) were set up to find out its optimum value for
reduction of fop dione at ph 8.0 and 40°c (200 rpm).
percentage reduction increased with increasing cellmass
and maximum conversion was achieved with a cell concentration of 250 mg  xxxg1167xxx  (54% product yield with
ee [99%) (fig. 5). further increase in cellmass concentration did not increase percentage reduction. experiments
to improve the product yield with higher substrate concentration are in progress in our laboratory.
reduction of other prochiral ketones
reduction of various aryl and heteroaryl ketones to the
corresponding chiral alcohol was tried with b. cenocepacia
as biocatalyst. no reduction was achieved with heteroaryl
ketones and naphthyl ketones. acetophenone and 40 substituted chloro, fluoro, bromo, and aminoacetophenones were
found to be suitable substrates (table 4). highest reduction
was observed with chloro-substituted acetophenones,

cells were grown for 10 h at 35°c (200 rpm), harvested by centrifugation, and suspended in phosphate buffer (ph 8) at a final concentration of 200 mg  xxxg1167xxx 
various substrates (ketones) were added (2 mm final concentration)
to the cell suspension and incubated at 35°c (200 rpm)
extent of bioreduction and enantiomeric excess of the product formed
were determined by rp and chiral hplc, respectively

followed by fluoro and bromoacetophenone. very little
bioreduction was observed with amino-substituted acetophenone. this may be because of an effect of the electronegativity of 40 -substituents. electron-releasing amino
substituents decreased the reduction, whereas electronwithdrawing substituents (f, cl, and br) enhanced the
bioreduction.

conclusion
the crucial homochiral ezetimibe intermediate (s)-fop
alcohol is synthesized by chiral reduction of fop dione

123

with different chemical catalysts. these chemical catalysts
can be replaced by microbial catalysts which are environment friendly and more selective. b. cenocepacia was
found to be a potential biocatalyst for reduction of fop
dione. bioreduction was maximum at ph 8.0 and 40°c
(200 rpm). bioreduction of fop dione yielded 54% chirally pure alcohol with [99% enantioselectivity. a patent
(application no. 1909/del/2008) has been filed for bioreduction of fop dione by b. cenocepacia. cellmass and
enzyme production by b. cenocepacia were improved by
optimizing environmental and nutritional conditions.
overall enzyme activity and cellmass production were
enhanced 1.85 and 2.06-fold, respectively, compared with
unoptimized media. various aryl and heteroaryl ketones
were reduced using b. cenocepacia as biocatalyst, and aryl
ketones were found to be suitable substrates for this
enzyme.
