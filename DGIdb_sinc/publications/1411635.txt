clinical pharmacology and schedule dependency of the  xxxd2980xxx  derivatives.  etoposide and  xxxd3309xxx  are closely related derivatives of  xxxd2980xxx , and both have a phase-specific action in the late s and early g2 phases of the cell cycle. etoposide has attracted more widespread use and study, although no evidence suggests a differing mode of action or spectrum of anticancer activity. the drugs have significant differences in their clinical pharmacology, however.  xxxd3309xxx  exhibits greater protein-binding affinity, has a longer plasma terminal elimination half-life, and has reduced plasma and renal clearances. little is accurately known about the metabolism of either drug, but the fact that 40% to 60% of administered etoposide is accounted for by excretion or metabolism, whereas the range is only 10% to 25% for  xxxd3309xxx , reflects a further difference between the drugs. renal dysfunction impairs etoposide excretion, but the effect of hepatic impairment on drug clearance is unclear. a specific oral formulation exists only for etoposide, although the unpalatable intravenous preparations of both drugs can be taken orally. the bioavailability of oral etoposide is about 50% at doses of 200 mg or less and decreases as drug doses increase. there is considerable intrapatient and interpatient variation in etoposide absorption, but the reasons for this are unknown. in vitro, the efficacy of etoposide is highly dependent on the schedule of administration. the superior efficacy without increased toxicity of more prolonged schedules of etoposide administration has been demonstrated recently in patients with small cell lung cancer (sclc). although the optimal schedule in any specific tumor is not known, current pharmacodynamic evidence suggests that the efficacy of etoposide, at least in sclc, is related to the maintenance of prolonged low blood concentrations of drug.
