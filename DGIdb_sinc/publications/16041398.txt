1 disseminated intravascular coagulation (dic) is the most common complication of solid tumours.
in this study, the effectiveness of three polysaccharide anticoagulants (psas), at therapeutic doses, at
inhibiting solid tumour growth was investigated.
2 mice with tumour xenografts were subcutaneously injected with either unfractionated heparin
(ufh; 200 units kg1 day1),  xxxd1805xxx  (75 units kg1 day1) or danaparoid (50 units kg1 day1). at
these concentrations, these psas are equieffective at inhibiting blood coagulation activated  xxxg741xxx .
in mice with lewis lung carcinoma (llc) tumours  xxxd1805xxx  and, to a lesser extent, ufh inhibited
both tumour growth and angiogenesis, whereas danaparoid did not. in contrast, in mice with kln205
tumours, all the psas inhibited tumour growth and angiogenesis.
3 all the psas significantly inhibited proliferation, migration of endothelial cells and vessel
formation in matrigel plugs containing  xxxg2413xxx  (vegf) and there were no
significant differences between these effects of the psas. the psas had no effect on endothelial cell
tubular formation in vitro.
4 although all the psas inhibited vegf production in kln205 tumours in vivo and cells in vitro,
in llc tumours and cells only ufh and  xxxd1805xxx  inhibited vegf production, whereas danaparoid
did not.
5 in both llc and kln205 tumours in vivo,  xxxg1076xxx  activity was inhibited by ufh and
 xxxd1805xxx , but not by danaparoid.
6 hence, ufh and  xxxd1805xxx  may be more effective than danaparoid at inhibiting cancer
progression in dic patients with solid tumours, due at least in part to their ability to suppress vegf
and  xxxg1076xxx  in tumours.

introduction
disseminated intravascular coagulation (dic) is one of the
most common and often fatal complications of solid tumours
(sallah et al., 2001). conversely, solid tumours are the most
common cause of dic (okajima et al., 2000). although the
mechanism of the derangement of the coagulation system in
patients with cancer is unclear, the inhibition of blood
coagulation activated  xxxg741xxx  ( xxxg741xxx ) is a standard treatment
for dic in cancer as well as for dic generally. there is
accumulating evidence from both animal and human studies
that polysaccharide anticoagulants (psas) such as unfractionated heparin (ufh) or  xxxd1997xxx 
(lmwh) can affect cancer progression (bijsterveld et al.,
1999; hettiarachchi et al., 1999; smorenburg & van noorden,

*author for correspondence;
e-mail: s_ebihara@geriat.med.tohoku.ac.jp

2001). although many mechanisms have been postulated for
the effects of psas on cancer, they are mostly independent of
their anticoagulant effects. since there is no doubt that the best
way of managing dic is to treat the underlying disorder (levi
& ten cate, 1999), the possible effects of psas on cancer
should be investigated to elucidate their mechanism of control
of the growth of solid tumours. blood supply is essential for
solid tumours and tumour growth is highly dependent on
angiogenesis, the formation of new capillaries from preexisting blood vessels (carmeliet & jain, 2000). much evidence
has been obtained suggesting that ufh and lmwh can affect
angiogenesis (smorenburg & van noorden, 2001). in order to
treat dic in patients with solid tumours, it is important to
know which psas are effective at inhibiting tumour angiogenesis and, hence, reducing tumour growth. therefore, in this
study, we compared the effects of three psas, at therapeutic
concentrations equieffective at inhibiting  xxxg741xxx , on various

334

aspects of tumour growth, in order to elucidate their
mechanisms of action and determine which psa is most
suitable for use in cancer patients.

methods
animals
male specific-pathogen-free c57bl/6 or bdf1 mice (clea
japan inc., tokyo, japan) 6–9 weeks of age were used
throughout the study. all procedures were performed according to animals (scientific procedures) act 1986 and approved
by the local ethics panel at tohoku university school of
medicine. the animals were killed with an overdose of
urethane (20 g kg1).

 xxxg741xxx  evaluation
blood was collected into 0.13 m trisodium citrate from c57bl/6
mice subcutaneously injected with either ufh (200 units kg1 day1),  xxxd1805xxx  (75 units kg1 day1) or danaparoid
(50 units kg1 day1) for 3 days. the doses of psas used were
similar to those given initially to patients with dic. the  xxxg741xxx 
coagulation factor in the plasma was evaluated using a
coagulation analyzer (coagulation analyzer, sysmex ca
1500, dade behring, kobe, japan). the plasma of a patient
with  xxxg741xxx  (biopool international, venture, ca, u.s.a.)
was used as a test reagent for the  xxxg741xxx . results are expressed as
a percentage of the mean value of the  xxxg741xxx  in blood from
control mice that were injected with 100 ml pbs for 3 days.
ufh ( xxxd2267xxx ),  xxxd1805xxx  (fragmins) and danaparoid
(orgarans) were purchased from takeda co. (osaka, japan),
kissei (nagano, japan) and organon (molenstraat, netherland), respectively.

bleeding time
c57bl/6 mice were subcutaneously injected with either ufh
(200 units kg1 day1),  xxxd1805xxx  (75 units kg1 day1) or danaparoid (50 units kg1 day1) for 2 weeks. the mice were then
anaesthetized with sodium thiopental and their tails transected
5 mm from the tip. bleeding was checked with filter paper
every 30 s and bleeding time was determined by measuring the
time until no blood was detected on the filter paper.

cell culture
lewis lung carcinoma cells (llcs: atcc, manassas, va,
u.s.a.) were cultured in high glucose dulbecco’s modified
eagle’s medium (dmem) containing 10% foetal calf serum
(fcs), 100 mg ml1 kanamycin. kln205 (atcc, manassas,
va, u.s.a.) cells, a cell line of mouse squamous cell lung
cancer, were cultured in minimum essential medium (mem)
containing 10% fcs, 1% nonessential amino acids and
100 mg ml1 kanamycin. primary human umbilical vein endothelial cells (huvecs) were purchased from clonetics (san
diego, ca, u.s.a.), and were cultured in endothelial cell
growth medium (egm-2 bullet kit, clonetics). to determine
the effects of the psas on the proliferation of llc, kln205
and huvec in vitro, 4  104 cells were seeded into six-well
british journal of pharmacology vol 146 (3)

 xxxg741xxx  inhibition and solid tumours

dishes, and then washed with pbs 12 h later. subsequently, the
adherent cells were stimulated by the addition of culture
medium containing various concentrations of the psas. to
estimate the proliferation of huvecs, after 72 h of treatment
with psas, the number of huvecs was counted. to quantify
vegf in the supernatant of cultured llc and kln205 cells,
2  105 cells were seeded into 100-mm dishes containing each
of the psas and, 72 h later, the supernatant was collected and
stored at 801c.

in vivo tumour models
llcs were injected (3  105 cells per animal) subcutaneously
into the centre of the back of 6- to 9-week-old c57bl/6 male
mice on day 0. kln 205 cells were injected (5  105 cells per
animal) subcutaneously into the centre of the back of 6- to
9-week-old bdf1 male mice on day 0. on day 5, when each
tumour became palpable, inoculated mice were randomly
allocated into four groups; mice in each group received a subcutaneous injection of either pbs (100 ml), ufh (200 units kg1),
 xxxd1805xxx  (75 units kg1) or danaparoid (50 units kg1).
injections were started from day 5 and given daily until the
mice were killed. tumour size was quantified daily as width2 
length  0.52.

immunohistochemistry and determination of microvessel
density (mvd)
when the diameter of the tumour became b1 cm, tumour
tissues were fixed in 10% formalin, embedded in paraffin and
sectioned. the sections were blocked with 10% normal goat
serum and incubated with polyclonal anti-human factor viiirelated antigen antibody (dako, carpinteria, ca, u.s.a.).
subsequently, the sections were incubated with biotinylated
goat anti-rabbit igg (vector, burlingame, ca, u.s.a.), and
then with abc kit (vector), and were detected by 3-amino-9ethylcarbazole (vector), counterstained with haematoxylin.
the intratumoral mvd was determined as described
previously (weidner et al., 1991; kanda et al., 2003). in brief,
the vessels inside the tumour were stained with anti-human
factor viii-related antigen antibody. the image that contained
the highest number of microvessels was chosen for each section
from an initial scan at  100 magnification. then, the vessels
were counted in the selected image at  200 magnification. at
least four fields were counted for each section, and the highest
count was used. two independent investigators evaluated the
number of vessels.

endothelial cell migration assay
to elucidate the effect of the psas on vegf-induced
endothelial cell migration, we used a modified boyden
chamber (chemotaxicell, kurabo, osaka, japan). human
recombinant vegf (20 ng ml1), in the presence of each psa
or pbs, was added to the bottom well of the chamber at a
volume of 750 ml of ebm-2 (san diego, ca, u.s.a.) containing 0.4% fcs. polycarbonate membranes with 3 mm pores
were coated with the attachment factor containing 0.1%
gelatin (cascade biologics, portland, or, u.s.a.) and placed
between the test substances and the upper chambers. huvecs
were harvested at appropriate cell densities. endothelial cells

h. takahashi et al

(1  105) were seeded to the inside of the upper chamber
suspended in 250 ml of ebm containing 0.4% fcs. the cells
were incubated at 371c in 5% co2 for 12 h. after incubation,
all the nonmigrated cells were removed from the upper side of
the filters with a cotton ball. the filters were fixed with
methanol, stained with dif-quick solution and mounted onto
microscope slides. the migrated cells were counted at  40
magnification using a microscope.

endothelial cell tubular formation assay
confluent huvecs were detached with trypsin-edta and
suspended in ebm containing 0.5% fcs, 10 ng ml1 human
recombinant vegf (r&d systems) and 1 or 10 units ml1 of
each psa, to investigate the effect of the psas on vegfinduced morphogenesis in vitro (kanda et al., 2003). the cells
were seeded into matrigel-coated 12-well tissue culture plates
at a density of 3  104 well1 and incubated at 371c. after 8 h,
the cells were observed using an inverted phase-contrast
microscope (nikon eclipse te300). images were captured
with a laser scanning confocal imaging system (bio-rad,
hercules, ca, u.s.a.). tubular formation was quantified by
measuring the length of tubes in randomly selected fields using
the nih image program.

in vivo matrigel plug assay
the angiogenic effect of each psa within 0.5 ml of matrigel
was studied in 6- to 9-week-old c57bl/6 mice. a mixture of
matrigel (becton dickinson labware) with either pbs or one
of the psas (10 units ml1) was injected into the abdominal
subcutaneous tissue of mice along the peritoneal midline. the
matrigel rapidly forms a solid plug at body temperature. after
10 days, excised plugs were photographed and their haemoglobin content was determined using hemoglobin test wako
(wako pure chemical industries, osaka, japan).
in a parallel experiment, vegf-induced angiogenesis in vivo
was assessed as the growth of blood vessels from subcutaneous
tissue into a solid matrigel plug that contained 500 ng ml1
vegf. growth factor-reduced matrigel (becton dickinson
labware), in liquid form at 41c, was mixed with 500 ng ml1
mouse recombinant vegf (r&d systems) and injected
(0.5 ml). to investigate the effect of psa treatment on
vegf-induced angiogenesis in vivo, mice were subcutaneously
injected with either pbs or each psa, at the same doses used in
the in vivo tumour experiments, into their backs every day for
10 days. the plugs were cut out by retaining the peritoneal
tissues, fixed in 10% formalin and embedded in paraffin.
sections stained with haematoxylin and eosin were studied
by light microscopy. the vessel area and the total matrigel
area were planimetrically calculated from the stained sections
using the nih image program. only those structures possessing a patent lumen and containing erythrocytes were
considered to be vessels. results are expressed as a percentage,
calculated as the ratio of the vessel area to the total matrigel
area.

quantification of vegf protein by elisa
to quantify serum vegf proteins, the inferior vena cava of
the mouse was punctured and peripheral blood was collected.

 xxxg741xxx  inhibition and solid tumours

335

to quantify tumour vegf proteins, 0.3 g of the frozen
tumour tissues were homogenized in 3 ml pbs, centrifuged for
20 min  xxxd1891xxx ,000  g at 41c and the supernatant collected. the
concentration of vegf in each sample was determined using
a murine vegf elisa kit (r&d). simultaneously, the total
amount of protein in each sample was measured by using
a bio-rad protein assay (bio-rad, hercules, ca, u.s.a.). the
vegf concentration in tumour samples is expressed as
pg mg1 protein.

 xxxg1076xxx  activity assay
frozen tumours were homogenized in extraction buffer (0.1 m
pbs, 0.15 m nacl, 1 mm pmsf, 10 g ml1 leupeptin, 1%
np-40) and centrifuged  xxxd1891xxx ,000  g for 15 min at 41c. the
protein concentration of the supernatant was measured by
use of a bradford assay (bio-rad, richmond, ca, u.s.a.).
the  xxxg1076xxx  activity in the supernatant was determined
by measuring heparan sulphate-degrading enzyme activity in
the sample using a heparan degrading enzyme assay kit
(takara bio inc., otsu, japan) (takahashi et al., 2004).

quantification of vegf and  xxxg1076xxx  rna in llcs
llcs were cultured in growth media with or without psas
for 72 h and rna was isolated using rnazol b reagent
(tel-test, inc., friendswood, tx, u.s.a.). rna expression of
vegf and  xxxg1076xxx  in llcs was determined by quantitative rt–pcr using specific oligonucleotide primers and
taqman probes purchased from applied biosystems
(foster city, ca, u.s.a.) (assay-on-demand products:
mm00437304 for mouse vegf and mm00461768 for
mouse  xxxg1076xxx ). mouse b-actin rna was simultaneously
assessed as a housekeeping gene using the following primers
and probes:
forward, 50 -acggccaggtcatcactattg-30 ;
reverse, 50 -ccaagaaggaaggctggaaaa-30 ;
taqman probe, 50 -fam-caacgagcggttccgatgccctamra-30 .
real-time rt–pcr application was carried out in duplicate in
50 ml reaction volumes containing 4 ng total rna for each
specific reaction using taqman one-step rt–pcr master
mix reagents kit (applied biosystems, ca, u.s.a.).

data analysis and statistics
data are presented as mean7s.e. unless otherwise indicated,
statistical comparisons between groups were performed using
student’s t-test or one-way anova with fisher’s leastsignificant-difference test as a post hoc test, as appropriate.

effect of psas on tumour growth and cancer cell

in mice inoculated with llcs or kln205s, all the psas, at
the doses used, had similar inhibitory effects on  xxxg741xxx . whereas
in llc-inoculated mice, the tumour growth was markedly
inhibited by  xxxd1805xxx  and, to a lesser extent, by ufh, but
danaparoid did not inhibit tumour growth (figure 1b). in
kln205-inoculated mice, all the psas inhibited tumour
growth, the potency order being dalteparin4ufh4danaparoid. the proliferation curves of llcs and kln205s were
investigated in vitro. none of the psas affected either llc or

tumour growth by directly affecting the proliferation of cancer
cells.

effects of psas on tumour angiogenesis
the immunostaining of factor viii-related antigen in tumours
of similar size (b1 cm diameter) showed that there were
decreased densities of vessels in ufh- and  xxxd1805xxx -treated
tumours compared with those treated with pbs and danaparoid (figure 2a, left). the mvds in ufh- and dalteparintreated tumours were also significantly lower than those in
pbs- and danaparoid-treated tumours (figure 2a, right).
there was no difference in mvd between pbs- and

effect of psas on in vivo angiogenesis in matrigel plugs

direct effects of psas on endothelial cells in vitro

to investigate the interaction between psas and angiogenesis,
we performed a matrigel plug assay using matrigels containing
10 units ml1 of each of the psas. psa-containing matrigels
showed a bloody appearance, suggesting vascularization inside
the plug, whereas pbs-containing matrigels did not (figure 3a,
upper). estimation of haemoglobin content in the matrigel
plug showed that psas themselves are able to induce
angiogenesis (figure 3a, lower).
we investigated the effect of subcutaneous injections of the
psas on vegf-induced angiogenesis using matrigel plugs
containing vegf. vessel formation in matrigels in psainjected mice did not look like that in matrigels in pbs-injected
mice (figure 3b, upper). since the matrigel itself did not
contain the psas, it had little haemoglobin, so angiogenesis
was estimated by calculating the area of vessels. all psas
significantly inhibited vegf-induced vessel formation in

in contrast to in vivo angiogenesis, 1 u ml1 of each of the
psas significantly suppressed huvec proliferation
(figure 4a). moreover, all the psas significantly inhibited
vegf-induced migration of huvec in vitro (figure 4b) and
there were no significant differences between the inhibitory
effects of the psas on migration.
in addition, the effect of the psas on the morphogenesis of
endothelial cells was investigated by estimating the tubular
formation of huvec. vegf-induced tubular formation in
the matrigel was not significantly affected by the addition of
the psas (figure 4c).

 xxxg741xxx  inhibition and solid tumours

the same order as those in serum (figure 5b). the concentration of vegf protein in tumours in  xxxd1805xxx -treated mice
was significantly decreased compared with that in the other
three groups (figure 5b). in vitro, vegf protein levels in
culture medium containing llcs were reduced by ufh and
 xxxd1805xxx  in a dose-dependent manner, but not by danaparoid
(figure 5a). the inhibitory effect of  xxxd1805xxx  was always
greater than that of ufh. we assessed vegf mrna in llcs
quantitatively by real-time pcr. both ufh and  xxxd1805xxx 
dose-dependently inhibited vegf mrna (figure 5d).
in contrast, in mice with kln205 tumours, all the psas
inhibited serum vegf to a similar extent (figure 6a) and they
significantly reduced tumour vegf production (figure 6b).
in vitro, all the psas inhibited vegf production in
kln205 cells in a concentration-dependent manner, with a
potency order of ufh ¼ dalteparin4danaparoid (figure 6c).
in addition, all the psas significantly inhibited the expression
of vegf mrna in vitro (figure 6d).

effects of psas on  xxxg1076xxx  activity and mrna
expression
psas are well-known inhibitors of  xxxg1076xxx  activity (parish
et al., 1987; voldavsky & friedmann, 2001) and  xxxg1076xxx  is
a potent angiogenic factor (elkin et al., 2001; goldshmidt
et al., 2002). hence, we investigated the effects of the psas on
 xxxg1076xxx  activity in llc and kln205 tumours in vivo. in
llc tumours, ufh and  xxxd1805xxx  significantly inhibited
tumour  xxxg1076xxx  activity, whereas danaparoid did not at the
dose used (figure 7a). in kln205 tumours,  xxxd1805xxx  was
the only psa that inhibited  xxxg1076xxx  activity (figure 7b).
we also assessed  xxxg1076xxx  mrna quantitatively in
llcs treated with ufh and  xxxd1805xxx  in vitro; both ufh
and  xxxd1805xxx  inhibited  xxxg1076xxx  mrna in a dosedependent manner (figure 7c).

discussion
in this study, we showed that an lmwh,  xxxd1805xxx , is more
effective at inhibiting experimental tumour growth than ufh
and danaparoid at concentrations that produce the same level
of  xxxg741xxx  inhibition and that this effect is mediated, at least in
part, by inhibition of tumour vegf and  xxxg1076xxx  production. despite the increasing availability of lmwhs, ufh is
still widely used as an antithrombotic drug for the initial
management of dic because it is inexpensive (hirsh et al.,
2001) and danaparoid is sometimes chosen because of its
potent anti- xxxg741xxx  activity (meuleman, 1992). since dic is one
of the most common complications of cancer, the effect of
these drugs on tumour growth during dic treatment might be
an important factor in the choice of antithrombotic drug.
although the dose of the drug used to treat dic will vary
depending on the situation, the initial doses of ufh,
 xxxd1805xxx , and danaparoid are about 50–100 units kg1 day1,
100 units kg1 day1, and 750 anti- xxxg741xxx  units kg1 day1, respectively. since the half-life of ufh is about four times less
than those of  xxxd1805xxx  and danaparoid, from the pharmacokinetics of subcutaneous injections, doses of 200
units kg1 day1, 75 units kg1 day1 and 50 anti- xxxg741xxx  units
kg1 day1, respectively, were chosen for the daily injections.
the anti- xxxg741xxx  level is the only method available for estimating

clotting activities for all these drugs. at the concentrations
used, ufh,  xxxd1805xxx  and danaparoid were equieffective at
inhibiting  xxxg741xxx , suggesting that their potency at treating dic
should be comparable. however, bleeding time was significantly prolonged in ufh-treated mice (figure 1).
several studies have described both stimulatory and
inhibitory effects of heparins on tumour growth and metastasis
(hejma et al., 1999). these diverse effects may be due to the
ability of these drugs to affect other processes, such as
angiogenesis, in addition to their anticoagulant properties

(folkman & shing, 1992). in this study, although none of the
psas affected the proliferation of cancer cells, both llc
tumour growth and microvessel densities were significantly
suppressed by ufh and  xxxd1805xxx  but not by danaparoid. in
kln205 tumours, all the psas inhibited both tumour growth
and angiogenesis in vivo. these results suggest that the
suppression of tumour growth can be attributed to the
inhibition of tumour angiogenesis. lmwh and ufh have
been found to have different effects on angiogenesis in
previous studies (norrby, 1993; pieper et al., 2002).

it was interesting that, in the absence of cancer cells, all
three psas induced angiogenesis in vivo when they were
included in the matrigel plug (figure 3a). in particular, the
matrigel plug containing danaparoid had a higher haemoglobin content than the others. angiogenesis in matrigel plugs
has also been found to be markedly enhanced by the addition
of heparin (passaniti et al., 1992). however, when psas
were not included in the matrigel, vegf-induced vessel
formation in the matrigel was similarly inhibited by subcutaneous injections of each of the psas (figure 3b). this
suggests that the psas are able to modulate angiogenic growth
factors.
although various studies have evaluated the effects of ufh
and lmwh on the proliferation of vascular endothelial cells
in vitro (smorenburg & van noorden, 2001), few have
investigated the effect of exogenously added heparan sulphate.
in vitro, all three psas significantly inhibited the proliferation
and migration of vascular endothelial cells (figure 3a and b).
however, the psas had no significant effect on endothelial cell
morphogenesis in vitro (figure 3c). the results depicted in
figures 3 and 4 suggest that, in the absence of cancer cells, the
effects of the psas on angiogenesis are similar both in vitro
british journal of pharmacology vol 146 (3)

and in vivo. in contrast, the effect of danaparoid on tumour
angiogenesis was different in llc and kln205 tumours.
since the induction and maintenance of tumour angiogenesis
requires angiogenic growth factors produced by cancer cells
(carmeliet, 2000), the diverse effects of danaparoid on
angiogenesis in llc and kln205 tumours could be due to
differences in the effects of danaparoid on the production of
these angiogenic growth factors.
of all the angiogenic factors produced by tumours, vegf
is one of the most potent (ferrara et al., 2003). the interaction
of vegf with its receptor is believed to play a major role in
angiogenesis in human tumours (ferrara, 2002). we found
that, in llc tumours, ufh and  xxxd1805xxx  suppressed vegf
production in vivo, whereas danaparoid did not. this result is
consistent with those from the in vitro experiments in which
vegf release from llcs was determined. in kln205
tumours, all the psas significantly inhibited vegf production in tumours, in vivo, and from kln205 cells in vitro.
thus, the effect of danaparoid on vegf production in
cancer cells depends on their type. although vegf is
bound to heparins (el-sheikh et al., 2002; lever & page,
2002), our study showed that both ufh and  xxxd1805xxx  had

the ability to suppress vegf production in cancer cells at the
mrna level.
owing to structural similarities with heparan sulphate, ufh
and lmwh inhibited the enzyme  xxxg1076xxx , which hydrolyses the internal glycosidic linkage of heparan sulphate in
basement membranes and ecm (parish et al., 1987; voldavsky & friedmann, 2001). in cancer progression,  xxxg1076xxx 
has a role not only in invasion and metastasis but also in
the induction of tumour angiogenesis (elkin et al., 2001;
goldshmidt et al., 2002). ufh and lmwh both inhibited
 xxxg1076xxx  activity in llc tumours, whereas danaparoid did
not (figure 7a), which is consistent with the inhibitory effects
of ufh and  xxxd1805xxx  on  xxxg1076xxx  mrna expression in
llcs in vivo. on the other hand,  xxxg1076xxx  activity
in kln205 tumours was significantly inhibited only by
 xxxd1805xxx , suggesting the lack of a relationship between
 xxxg1076xxx  activity and tumour angiogenesis in kln205
cells (figure 7b).
taken together, our data from llc and kln205 tumours
suggest that psas inhibit tumour angiogenesis, at least in part,
by suppressing vegf production rather than  xxxg1076xxx 
production in cancer cells. the effect of danaparoid on vegf
production in cancer cells might be cell type specific, resulting

in different effects on tumour angiogenesis. since there are
several other angiogenic growth factors such as basic
fibroblast growth factor, placenta-like growth factor, platelet-derived growth factors and  xxxg562xxx , further studies are
needed to clarify the antiangiogenic mechanism of psas.
subcutaneous injections of danaparoid did not inhibit
 xxxg1076xxx  in either llc or kln205 tumours.  xxxg1076xxx 
is known to have an important role in cancer metastasis as it
degrades the extracellular matrix (parish et al., 1987) and is
involved in the progression of cancer (takahashi et al., 2004).
our results suggest that, in contrast to heparins, danaparoid
does not inhibit cancer metastasis.
in our experiments, although both ufh and  xxxd1805xxx 
inhibited angiogenesis in vivo and in vitro, the effect of
 xxxd1805xxx  was generally seen before that of ufh. moreover,
at doses that are similarly potent at inhibiting  xxxg741xxx ,  xxxd1805xxx 
is less likely to cause bleeding than ufh (figure 1a).
therefore, our results suggest that lmwh may have
advantages compared to other psas as a treatment for dic
in patients with solid tumours. recently, danaparoid has
become widely used as an anticoagulant in patients with active
or past heparin-induced thrombocytopaenia (tardy-poncet
et al., 1999). however, the precise mechanism of its selective

action on  xxxg741xxx  is unclear. since we found that the effect of
danaparoid on tumour growth and angiogenesis differs
between cancer cells, it might be of clinical importance to
evaluate the survival of various cancer patients treated with
danaparoid.
