abstract
 xxxg1479xxx  reductase ( xxxg1480xxx ) regenerates methylated cobalamin levels from the oxidised cob(ii)alamin form and in so
doing plays a crucial role in maintaining the active state of  xxxg1479xxx  (mtr). mtr is an essential enzyme catalyzing the
conversion of homocysteine to methionine. single nucleotide polymorphisms (snps) within the  xxxg1480xxx  gene may potentially compromise mtr activity leading to elevated homocysteine levels, a known risk factor for neural tube defects (ntds). we studied the
 xxxg1480xxx  polymorphisms i22m (66a ! g), s175l (524c ! t), and k350r (1049a ! g) as potential ntd risk factors in a large
homogeneous irish ntd population. degree of risk was assessed via case/control comparison, log-linear analysis, and transmission
disequilibrium testing. no association was found between ntds and i22m in mothers (p d 0.16, or1.14 [0.95–1.38], n d 447) or
cases (p d 0.13, or1.15 [0.96–1.38], n d 470) compared to controls (n d 476). a dominant i22m paternal evect was found through
case/control comparison and log-linear modelling (p d 0.019) (goodness-of-wt p d 0.91, or 1.46 [1.10–1.93], n d 423). no signiwcant
ntd association was found with s175l or k350r in cases or their parents and no interactions were observed between these polymorphisms and the d919g variant of mtr or the a222v variant of 5,10- xxxg1475xxx  ( xxxg1475xxx ). we also
compared the frequencies of i22m, s175l, and k350r in african-americans versus american-caucasians. the frequencies of i22m
and k350r divered signiwcantly between the two groups (p d 0.0005 and p d 0.0001, respectively). our wndings do not support an
important role for these  xxxg1480xxx  variants in ntds.

introduction
women with elevated plasma homocysteine, low
folate or low vitamin b12 (cobalamin) levels are at
increased risk of having a child with a neural tube
defect (ntd) [1–3]. periconceptional intake of folic
acid prevents up to 70% of ntds [4]. the mechanism
of this protection has yet to be fully elucidated but is
believed to involve both genetic and environmental
factors. recent investigations have focused on screening single nucleotide polymorphisms (snps) within
candidate genes that encode enzymes involved in the
folate/homocysteine metabolic pathway for an association with ntd risk.
methyltetrahydrofolate homocysteine methyltransferase, otherwise known as  xxxg1479xxx 
(mtr) [ xxxg1479xxx ], and its activation partner  xxxg1479xxx  reductase ( xxxg1480xxx ) [ec 2.1.1.135] act at
the metabolic junction of homocysteine, 5-methyltetra
hydrofolate, and cobalamin. mtr converts 5-methyltetrahydrofolate and homocysteine to tetrahydrofolate
and methionine.  xxxg1480xxx  plays a crucial role in maintaining the active state of mtr through the reductive
methylation of cob(ii)alamin [5] and therefore, it is an
important candidate gene to study in relation to ntd
risk.
mutation analysis of patients with severe  xxxg1480xxx 
dewciency led to the discovery of a common coding variant in this gene at cdna nucleotide position 66 (designating position 1 as the “a” in the initial translation
atg start site) that replaces an isoleucine with a methionine at amino acid position 22 (i22m) [6]. this  xxxg1480xxx 
polymorphism is located within the xavin mononucleotide binding domain of the enzyme and may interfere
with  xxxg1479xxx  interaction [7]. several studies
have linked the methionine containing allele of i22m
with ntd risk. a small case-control study showed i22m
to be associated with an increased ntd risk in individuals with low cobalamin levels [6]. in addition, gene–gene
interaction studies showed that variants in the key folate
enzymes,  xxxg1475xxx  ( xxxg1475xxx )
and mtr, enhanced ntd risk [6,8,9].
in this study we tested for association between
 xxxg1480xxx  polymorphisms and ntd risk in one of the largest and most ethnically homogeneous samples yet
reported. we also evaluated whether the interaction of
 xxxg1480xxx  i22m with  xxxg1475xxx  a222v (677c ! t) and
mtr d919g (2756a ! g) contributes to ntd risk.

subjects and methods
subjects
our study sample set consisted of complete and
incomplete (where dna was not available from all

221

family members) triads made up of ntd-avected children (referred to as ntd cases) and their parents
(referred to as mothers and fathers). families (n d 575)
were recruited throughout the republic of ireland
from 1993 to 2004 with the assistance of the irish association for spina biwda and hydrocephalus and the
irish public health nurses. the majority of cases had
spina biwda (95%) while the remainder had encephalocele (5%).
control blood samples were collected from a population of 56,049 pregnant women attending the three main
maternity hospitals in the dublin area between 1986 and
1990 [1]. for this study we selected a random subset
(n d 487) of these pregnant women who did not give
birth to an ntd-avected child and had no previous history of an ntd-avected pregnancy. ethical approval
was obtained for all collected samples.
to estimate ethnic diverences in allele frequencies we
studied a panel of 100 random healthy unrelated selfidentiwed african-american (hd100aa) (males n d 17,
females n d 83) and 100 unrelated self-identiwed american-caucasian (hd100cau) (males n d 51, females n d
49) individuals (dna purchased from the coriell cell
repositories, camden, new jersey).
genetic analysis
genomic dna from ntd complete and incomplete
triads and random controls was extracted from whole
blood using qiaamp dna blood mini kit (qiagen,
uk). the allelic frequencies within the irish population
(>200 samples genotyped) of the following six snps
were assessed using allele-speciwc oligonucleotide
hybridisation (aso), restriction enzyme digestion, and
automated sequencing: rs1801394: i22m (66a ! g),
rs1532268: s175l (524c ! t), rs161870: l179l
(537t ! c), rs2303080: s257t (770t ! a), rs162036:
k350r (1049a ! g), and rs2287780: r415c (1243c
! t), (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/snp/). only variants where the minor allele frequency exceeded 0.05 were
evaluated as ntd risk factors.
before starting the ntd association screen a strategy
was implemented in which a subset of our sample set
(n d 1195) was genotyped and analysed. this subset
(n d 1195) consists of mothers (n d 301), fathers (n d
290), ntd cases (n d 279), and irish controls (n d 325).
the size of this subset rexects the number of genotypes
that were successfully genotyped for s175l (1195/1235;
97%). this subset represents 97% of the full sample set
that was available at the time of completion of the
s175l genotyping. an a priori threshold was set to trigger the genotyping of the entire sample set. if interim
genetic analyses of mothers or cases compared to controls resulted in a p value of 0.2 or less (0.3 in fathers) the
entire sample set would be analysed. this strategy was
designed to avoid genotyping large numbers of subjects

when the results were clearly negative. pcr assays for
the ampliwcation of speciwc regions of  xxxg1480xxx  were
designed from the genomic sequence (nt_006576
[ xxxg1480xxx ]) and primer express (pe applied biosystems
uk).  xxxg1480xxx  i22m (66a ! g) was pcr ampliwed using
previously described primers and conditions [10]. table
1 shows the primers used to amplify the region containing these snps, the pcr product size, and their respective melting temperatures. the i22m (66a ! g)
forward primer was designed with a mismatch from the
published  xxxg1480xxx  sequence (underlined, table 1), creating an ndei restriction endonuclease site in the ampliwed
dna. ndei digestion of ampliwed alleles containing the
a ! g polymorphism cuts the 152 bp pcr product into
123 and 29 bp products. the fragments were separated
on a 2.5% 3:1 nusieve–agarose gel containing 10 g/ml
ethidium bromide.

s175l
(524c ! t),
l179l
(537t ! c), s257t (770t ! a), k350r (1049a ! g),
and r415c (1243c ! t) was carried out via aso analysis. the genotypes of controls and a subset of samples
were veriwed by dna sequencing (bigdye terminator
cycle sequencing kit version 1.1, applied biosystems,
uk) and an abi 377 automated sequencer.
analysis of d919g (2756a ! g) involved the pcr
ampliwcation of the region surrounding this snp
using previously published primers and conditions
[11]. genotypes were analysed by primer extension
and matrix assisted laser desorption/ionisation-time
of xight (maldi-tof) mass spectrometry
(sequenom).
genotyping quality was tested by repeat genotyping
approximately 10% of the samples using the initial genotyping method and genotyping approximately 30% of
samples using an independent pcr assay followed by

maldi-tof or taqman (abi 7900) for  xxxg1480xxx  and
mtr, respectively. all genotypes were independently
double scored. repeat genotypes were in >96% agreement with the original results.
dna samples from the coriell cell repositories
(hd100cau and hd100aa) were genotyped by
primer extension/maldi-tof (sequenom).
statistical analysis
allele and genotype frequency comparisons were performed between ntd-avected family members (mother,
father, and ntd case) and random controls on a two by
three contingency table using likelihood ratio and wald 2
tests. the level of signiwcance was set at p d 0.05 with a
95% conwdence interval. the association between casecontrol status and genotype was examined using a number of standard odds ratios. the sas proc nlmixed
software package was used for all statistical analysis. this
software package allows estimation of nonlinear functions
of the parameters of the model and provides standard
errors calculated using the delta method [12]. the parameterisation of the model can be modiwed for the computation of diverent odds ratios. this approach enabled us to
estimate log odds ratios and their standard errors for the
computation of conwdence intervals, as well as check the
goodness-of-wt of diverent models. conwdence intervals
were computed for the logarithm of the allelic odds ratio
and transformed to the original scale. in particular we
examined dominant (homozygous vs. other), recessive
(homozygous and heterozygous vs. other) evects and allelic odds ratios. goodness-of-wt testing was performed to
test for deviations from hardy–weinberg equilibrium.
comparison of allele transmission from informative heterozygous parents to ntd children was carried out
through the use of the transmission disequilibrium test
(tdt) (mcnemar’s test) [13]. for genotype comparisons,
both recessive and dominant evects were analysed using
the log-linear model. the parameter estimates of the loglinear model were based on case–parent–triad data following the method described by eq. (1) in weinberg et al.
[14]. each model included the corresponding case and
maternal evects [14]. the parameters were the log odds
ratios. hardy–weinberg equilibrium was assumed in these
models [14], and the model included the control data for
estimation of the allele frequencies. the analysis included
a goodness-of-wt test for hwe. gene–gene interaction
analysis was carried out through case/control genotype
comparison using 3 £ 3 contingency tables. interaction
was assessed through chi-squared testing of logistic dominant and recessive models as described in piegorsch et al.
[15].
linkage disequilibrium between i22m, s175l, and
k350r was assessed using d⬘ and r2 values generated
through the use of the program haploview (http://
www.broad.mit.edu/personal/jcbarret/haploview/).

results and discussion
genotyping
 xxxg1480xxx  s257t [770t ! a] (s allele frequency 1.0
(224/224)) is monomorphic and  xxxg1480xxx  r415c
[1243c ! t] (r allele frequency 0.99 (235/236)) has a
very low variation frequency within the irish population.
pcr products from randomly chosen samples were
sequenced to conwrm the status that the correct region
of the genome was being ampliwed.  xxxg1480xxx  l179l
[537tc > t] with a t allele frequency of 0.04 (n d 290)
was not screened in our sample set.
three nonsynonymous coding snps (rs1801394: i22m
(66a ! g), rs1532268: s175l (524c ! t), and rs162036:
k350r (1049a ! g)) within  xxxg1480xxx  with a variant allele
frequency of >0.05 were chosen for analysis. the genotyping success rate for i22m (66a ! g), s175l (524c ! t),
and k350r (1049a ! g) was 96% (1816/1894), 97%
(1195/1235), and 99% (1225/1235), respectively. the genotyping success rate was >95% within all subgroups. internal and external quality control for each snp was >96%.
all genotyping discrepancies were resolved.
ntd-avected family member versus control comparison
analysis
i22m (66a ! g), s175l (524c ! t), and k350r
(1049a ! g) genotype and allele frequency comparisons were made between ntd-avected family members
(mother, father, and ntd case) and controls. i22m
(66a ! g) allele frequencies did not diver signiwcantly
between mothers (p d 0.16, or 1.14 [0.95–1.38]) or cases
(p d 0.13, or 1.15 [0.96–1.38]) and controls. when allele
frequencies in fathers and controls were compared for
i22m (66a ! g) a signiwcant association was detected
(p d 0.019, or 1.25 [1.04–1.50]). for genotype comparisons, both recessive and dominant evects were analysed
separately within the log-linear model. the g allele
appeared to be associated with risk when the dominant
model was applied (gg + ag/aa) in the fathers
(p d 0.0079, or 1.49 [1.10–1.93]). the same genotypes
(gg + ag) were overrepresented in ntd cases compared to controls although these results did not reach
statistical signiwcance (p d 0.066, or 1.29 [0.99–1.69],
goodness-of-wt p d 0.89). no signiwcant diverences were
observed when the genotypes of mothers were compared
to controls (p d 0.21, or 1.19 [0.91–1.56]).
no signiwcant associations were observed for s175l
(524c ! t) allelic comparisons for mothers (p d 0.72, or
0.96 [0.75–1.21]), fathers (p d 0.36, or 0.89 [0.7–1.14]) or
cases (p d 0.49, or 0.92 [0.72–1.17]). neither signiwcant
dominant nor recessive evects were found in any of these
subgroups for s175l (524c ! t) (data not shown).
k350r (1049a ! g) allelic comparisons of ntdavected cases (p d 0.78, or 1.05 [0.73–1.52]) and their

223

mothers (p d 0.8, or 1.05 [0.74–1.47]) versus controls
showed no signiwcant association. a trend towards signiwcance was seen in allelic comparisons with fathers
against controls (p d 0.08, or 1.36 [0.96–1.92]). with
genotypic comparisons a borderline signiwcant recessive
evect (gg/aa + ag) was seen in mothers (p d 0.059,
or 0.13 [0.02–1.08], goodness-of-wt p d 0.15). a borderline signiwcant dominant evect (aa/ag + gg) in
fathers was also seen (p d 0.076, or 1.4 [0.97–2.03],
goodness-of-wt p d 0.85). however, control genotypes
used for comparisons in the k350r screen deviated from
hardy–weinberg
equilibrium
(goodness-of-wt
p d 0.045), making it diycult to draw conclusions from
the k350r comparisons.
transmission disequilibrium test
the transmission disequilibrium test (tdt) was performed to test for deviations from random allele segregation from parent to avected ovspring. the tdt was
performed on informative ntd triads where at least
one parent is heterozygous [13]. the number of informative alleles for i22m (66a ! g), s175l (524c ! t),
and k350r (1049a ! g) was n d 386, n d 217, and
n d 118, respectively. there was no deviation from random segregation for these polymorphisms (data not
shown).
allele frequency comparison by racial group
as the prevalence of ntds varies considerably
between diverent races/ethnic groupings, it is of interest
to estimate the diverences in the allele frequencies
between such populations as african-americans, which
may serve as a rough proxy of a genome with the highest
degree of diversity. likewise, we can use the caucasian
controls to test if the north american population
roughly mirrors the allele frequencies observed in the
irish population. these analyses also give an indication
of allele frequency altering events that have occurred
since the post-african migration that may contribute to
population divergence and ethnic diverences in ntd
susceptibility.
inter-racial comparisons were made between allele
and genotype frequencies of  xxxg1480xxx  i22m (66a ! g),
s175l (524c ! t), k350r (1049a ! g), and mtr
d919g (2756a ! g) within african-american and
american-caucasian populations (table 2). the genotyping success rate was 93.5% (187/200) for i22m
(66a ! g), 91.5% (183/200) for s175l (524c ! t),
92.5% (185/200) for k350r, and 92% (184/200) for d919g
(2756a ! g). the i22m g allele frequency within african-americans, american-caucasians, and irish controls
was 0.66, 0.44, and 0.41, respectively. i22m (66a ! g)
allele frequencies were signiwcantly diverent between
african-american and either american-caucasians

allele frequencies were seen when irish controls (g

population (g allele d 0.44) (p d 0.72).
a borderline signiwcant diverence was seen between

frequency was similar for american-caucasian (g d
0.13) and irish controls (g d 0.11) (p d 0.65). k350r
(1049a ! g) allele frequencies were signiwcantly diverent between african-american (g d 0.41) and american-caucasians individuals (p d 0.0001) and with irish
controls (p d 0.0001) (table 2). it appears that the
k350r (1049a ! g) a allele was enriched in europeans
following the post-african migration.
mtr d919g 2756a ! g
d919g (2756a ! g) within  xxxg1479xxx  has
been previously evaluated in 83 irish ntd triads and

controls and no ntd association was found [11].
d919g (2756a ! g) was re-evaluated for this study
using this larger sample set of irish ntd triads
(mothers d 386, fathers d 352, and cases d 382) and controls (n d 487). a 96.7% genotyping success rate was
obtained (1607/1661). group genotypes did not deviate
from hardy–weinberg equilibrium. d919g (2756a
! g) allele frequencies did not diver signiwcantly
between mothers (p d 0.35, or 1.12 [0.88–1.44]), fathers
(p d 0.56, or 0.93 [0.72–1.19]), or cases (p d 0.79, or
0.97 [0.75–1.24]) and controls. log-linear comparison
analysis conwrmed a lack of ntd association with
mtr d919g. tdt analysis also showed no preferential
transmission (p d 0.999). no signiwcant diverences in
d919g (2756a ! g) allelic frequencies were found
between african-american and american-caucasian
populations (p d 0.47) or irish controls (p d 0.862)
(table 2).
linkage disequilibrium analysis between i22m (66g ! a),
s175l (524c ! t), and k350r (1049a ! g)
linkage disequilibrium between i22m (66g ! a),
s175l (524c ! t), and k350r (1049a-g) was estimated using genotypes from 246 control individuals. the
program haploview was used to calculate d⬘ and r2 values. no evidence of linkage disequilibrium was found
between these snps (table 3) despite  xxxg1480xxx  being
located in a genomic region where signiwcant linkage
disequilibrium occurs according to hapmap project
data.

 xxxg1480xxx  i22m (66a ! g) interaction with  xxxg1475xxx 
a222v (677c ! t) and mtr d919g (2756a ! g)
we assessed ntd risk due to the combination of two
polymorphisms in diverent folate candidate genes within
this large sample set. no interaction was observed
between  xxxg1480xxx  i22m (66a ! g) and  xxxg1475xxx  a222v
(677c ! t) under dominant and recessive models
(p d 0.24 and p d 0.74, respectively). similarly, no interaction was seen between dominant or recessive alleles
within  xxxg1480xxx  i22m (66a ! g) and mtr d919g
(2756a ! g) (p d 0.77 and p d 0.69, respectively).

discussion
 xxxg1479xxx  (mtr) converts homocysteine
to methionine using methylcobalamin as the catalytic
methyl group donor. enzyme-bound cobalamin cycles
between methylcobalamin and  xxxd1771xxx  forms,
with 5-methyltetrahydrofolate being its primary
methyl group donor. occasionally, oxidation of
 xxxd1771xxx  to cob(ii)alamin occurs and a reductive
methylation to methylcobalamin is required, catalysed
by  xxxg1479xxx  reductase ( xxxg1480xxx ). humans
lacking mtr activity (patients in the  xxxg1479xxx  complementation group) have severe clinical consequences
[16]. in mice, complete loss of mtr activity leads to
early embryonic lethality [17]. since  xxxg1480xxx  is essential
to maintain mtr function, nonsynonymous genetic
variations within  xxxg1480xxx  may also cause subtle evects
on the developing embryo, including a predisposition
to ntds. prior to this study, i22m [66a ! g] was the
only  xxxg1480xxx  variation tested in relation to neural tube
defects [6,8,9,18,26], down syndrome [19–21], colorectal cancer [22], stroke [23] or coronary artery disease
[10,24,25]. in this study, we focused on several variants
in  xxxg1480xxx  as neural tube defect risk factors. previously,
we have shown that i22m (66a ! g) is a risk factor
associated with down syndrome within the irish population [20].
several studies from various populations have indicated that i22m might be a maternal risk factor for

225

developing an ntd pregnancy. one study of a hispanic
population from the texas-mexico border found a
higher risk of ntd among i22m gg homozygous
infants compared to aa homozygous individuals (or
2.6, 95% ci [1.3–5.3]) [9]. a canadian study found an
increased risk associated with the i22m variant but only
in a subset of cases and mothers with low levels of
plasma vitamin b12 [6]. an italian study found an
increase in ntd risk only when the  xxxg1475xxx  a222v
(677c ! t) cc genotype was combined with the
 xxxg1480xxx  i22m (66a ! g) gg genotype [8]. pietrzyk
et al. [18] reported signiwcant diverences in the prevalence of the i22m gg genotype in mothers and lumbosacral site ntd cases when compared to controls and
another study found a borderline signiwcance in the
transmission of i22m g allele from heterozygous maternal grandparents to the mothers of children with spina
biwda but no signiwcant over-transmission from the
mother to the avected ntd case was found [26]. however, all of these investigators concluded that the size of
their study was limited and that a larger population
study was needed to conwrm their results.
in contrast with these studies our large study did not
uncover a signiwcant association with i22m (66a ! g)
in mothers or ntd cases when allelic frequencies were
compared to controls although we did detect a signiwcant association for fathers (p d 0.019, or 1.25 [1.04–
1.50]). considering the greater evidence for the maternal
role in relation to ntds, we cannot rule out that this
wnding is a chance evect. we did not address the issue of
site of ntd lesion, as explored by pietrzyk et al. [18], or
of combined variant and phenotype evects, as reported
by wilson et al. [6] so we cannot rule out complex interactions of these variants with ntds.
the large size of our sample set enabled us to examine
not only  xxxg1480xxx  as an independent risk factor for ntd
but also whether  xxxg1480xxx  i22m interacted with polymorphisms within other crucial genes encoding enzymes
within the folate pathway. we tested the interaction of
 xxxg1480xxx  i22m/ xxxg1475xxx  a222v and  xxxg1480xxx  i22m/mtr
d919g to see whether an ntd association risk evect
existed in the presence of more than one of these polymorphisms within our population. unlike previous studies showing an enhanced ntd risk in the presence of
these polymorphisms [6,8,9,18,26], we found no signiwcant interaction between  xxxg1480xxx  i22m (66a ! g) and
 xxxg1475xxx  a222v (677c ! t) and mtr d919g
(1056a ! g) in our homogeneous population through
2 testing of dominant and recessive logistic models.
our study is the wrst association study to investigate
the role of s175l (524c ! t) in relation to a disease etiology. only a borderline signiwcant diverence in allele
frequency was seen between african-american and
american-caucasian populations (p d 0.048), suggesting that this polymorphism was common in the human
population prior to the establishment of the continental

226

v.b. o'leary et al. / molecular genetics and metabolism 85 (2005) 220–227

ethnic groups. no signiwcant inxuence was found within
mothers, fathers or ntd cases in relation to this polymorphism. these negative wndings are noteworthy, as
kinetic studies have shown that the i22/l175 variant
required a 3-fold higher ratio of  xxxg1480xxx  to mtr to
achieve full activation when compared to i22/s175
 xxxg1480xxx  [7].
in conclusion, we examined the largest number of
 xxxg1480xxx  snps to date in this ntd association screen,
including snps that have never before been examined.
our study is noteworthy as it provides the wrst association screen for  xxxg1480xxx  s175l. in addition, this report
extended our previous work on mtr d919g and conwrms our previous wnding that this polymorphism was
not a major ntd risk factor in the irish population.
 xxxg1480xxx  polymorphisms alone or in combination with
other folate enzyme polymorphisms were not associated
with ntd risk in this large study population. these
common polymorphisms do not appear to interfere with
 xxxg1480xxx ’s important role in enzyme activation during the
critical period of embryonic neural tube closure.
