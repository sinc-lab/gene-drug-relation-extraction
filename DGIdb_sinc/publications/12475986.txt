receptor gene superfamily (1). three isoforms (␣, ␤/␦, and ␥)
have been identified and are encoded by separate genes. among
them, ppar␥ has been further characterized into three subtypes, ppar␥1, ppar␥2, and ppar␥3 (2, 3). each type plays
an important role in cellular differentiation (4), apoptosis (5),
anti-inflammatory response (6), and lipid metabolism and metabolic disease, such as glucose homeostasis (7).
there are several known ligands for ppar␥, including the
natural prostaglandin 15-deoxy-⌬12,14-prostaglandin j2 (pgj2),
the synthetic anti-diabetic thiazolidinediones, and certain polyunsaturated  xxxd2154xxx . ppar␥ ligands are able to bind to the
ppar␥ transcription factor, which then forms a heterodimeric
complex with retinoid x receptor that functions as a central
regulator of differentiation, and modulator of cell growth.
many reports present evidence for anti-tumorigenic activity of
ppar␥ ligands (5, 6, 8 –10). among ppar␥ ligands, the antitumorigenic activity of  xxxd3448xxx  (tgz) has been well established. for example, tgz significantly inhibits tumor growth of
human colorectal cancer cells (hct-116), human breast cancer
cells (mcf-7), and human prostate cancer cells (pc-3) in immunodeficient mice (11–13). however, the molecular mechanism of tgz effects on anti-tumorigenesis, other than ppar␥
activation, is not known.
tgz has specific functions, in addition to being a ppar␥
agonist. for example, tgz up-regulates  xxxd2738xxx  synthesis
(14), induces the p53 pathway (15), inhibits cholesterol biosynthesis (16), induces p21 cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor (17),
has antioxidant function (18), and activates extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase (erk) (19) in a ppar␥-independent manner. thus, the molecular mechanism of tgz-induced
anti-tumorigenesis may result from multiple mechanisms.
the egr-1 transcription factor (also known as ngfi-a, tis8,
krox-24, and zif268) is a member of the immediate early gene
family and encodes a nuclear phosphoprotein involved in the
regulation of cell growth and differentiation in response to
signals such as mitogens, growth factors, and stress stimuli.
however, many reports have recently suggested egr-1 as a
tumor suppressor gene (20). egr-1 activates pten ( xxxg1870xxx ) tumor suppressor gene during uv
irradiation (21), and re-expression of egr-1 suppresses the
growth of transformed cells both in soft agar and in athymic
nude mice (22). egr-1 is induced very early in the apoptotic
process, where it mediates the activation of downstream regulators such as p53 (23–25). however, egr-1-induced apoptosis
has been reported in p53⫺/⫺ cells (26), indicating that egr-1
induction occurs in both p53-dependent and p53-independent
manners. moreover, egr-1 is down-regulated in several types of
neoplasia, as well as in an array of tumor cell lines (27, 28).

 xxxd3448xxx  (tgz) is a peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor ␥ (ppar␥) ligand that has pro-apoptotic
activity in human colon cancer. although tgz binds to
ppar␥ transcription factors as an agonist, emerging
evidence suggests that tgz acts independently of
ppar␥ in many functions, including apoptosis. early
growth response-1 (egr-1) transcription factor has been
linked to apoptosis and shown to be activated by extracellular signal-regulated kinase (erk). we investigated
whether tgz-induced apoptosis may be related to egr-1
induction, because tgz has been known to induce erk
activity. our results show that egr-1 is induced dramatically by tgz but not by other ppar␥ ligands. tgz
affects egr-1 induction at least by two mechanisms; tgz
increases egr-1 promoter activity by 2-fold and prolongs
egr-1 mrna stability by 3-fold. inhibition of erk phosphorylation in hct-116 cells abolishes the egr-1 induction by tgz, suggesting its erk-dependent manner.
further, the tgz-induced egr-1 expression results in
increased promoter activity using a reporter system
containing four copies of egr-1 binding sites, and tgz
induces egr-1 binding activity to egr-1 consensus sites
as assessed by gel shift assay. in addition, tgz induces
erk-dependent phosphorylation of ppar␥, resulting in
the down-regulation of ppar␥ activity. the fact that
tgz-induced apoptosis is accompanied by the biosynthesis of egr-1 suggests that egr-1 plays a pivotal role in
tgz-induced apoptosis in hct-116 cells. our results
suggest that egr-1 induction is a unique property of tgz
compared with other ppar␥ ligands and is independent
of ppar␥ activation. thus, the up-regulation of egr-1
may provide an explanation for the anti-tumorigenic
properties of tgz.

egr-1 induction by  xxxd3448xxx 

these results indicate that egr-1 plays a consistent role in
growth suppression. therefore, it is reasonable to think that
egr-1 could be regulated, at least in part by tgz, because both
tgz and egr-1 have anti-tumorigenic effects.
in the present study, we examine the relationship between
tgz and egr-1 expression and the effect of tgz-induced apoptosis. we show that tgz induces egr-1 expression by transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation. egr-1 induction by
tgz results in the increase of binding affinity and transactivation of the promoter containing egr-1 consensus sequences,
thereby possibly inducing other anti-tumorigenic proteins. furthermore, egr-1 induction by tgz appears to be independent of
ppar␥, because other ppar␥ ligands do not induce egr-1.
these data provide a novel mechanism for understanding how
 xxxd3448xxx  exerts its anti-tumorigenic activity.

expression vector (invitrogen). the pebs14luc construct was generously provided by dr. gerald thiel (university of bari, bari, italy). the
egr-1 promoter (⫺1260 to ⫹35) linked to the luciferase gene was cloned
by pcr from human genomic dna (promega, madison, wi) using the
following primers: 5⬘-cggctcgagcgggaggaggagcgaggaggcggcgg-3⬘ (top strand; xhoi site is underlined) and 5⬘-cccaagcttgggcggcggcggctccccaagttctgcggc-3⬘ (bottom strand;
hindiii site is underlined). after pcr amplification, the fragment was
digested with xhoi and hindiii and ligated into pglbasic3 luciferase
vector. all plasmids were sequenced for verification.
apoptosis and soft agar cloning assay in the presence of tgz—the
dna content for sub-g1 population was determined by flow cytometry.
hct-116 cells were plated at 3 ⫻ 105 cells/well in 6-well plates, incubated for 16 h, and then treated with tgz at different time points in the
presence of serum. the cells (attached and floating cells) were then
harvested, washed with phosphate-buffered saline, fixed by the slow
addition of cold 70% ethanol to a total of 1 ml, and stored at 4 °c
overnight. the fixed cells were pelleted, washed with ethanol (50%,
then 30%), followed by phosphate-buffered saline, and stained in 1 ml of
20 ␮g/ml  xxxd3027xxx  iodide containing 1 mg/ml rnase in phosphatebuffered saline for 20 min. 7,500 cells were examined by flow cytometry
using bd biosciences facsort equipped with cellquest software by
gating on an area versus width dot plot to exclude cell debris and cell
aggregates. apoptosis was measured by the level of sub-diploid dna
contained in cells following treatment with compounds using cellquest
software.
soft agar assays were performed to compare the clonogenic potential
of hct-116 cells in semisolid medium. hct-116 cells were resuspended
 xxxd1891xxx ,000 cells in 2 ml of 0.4% agarose-containing tgz in mccoy’s 5a
medium and plated on top of 1 ml of 0.8% agarose in 6-well plates.
plates were incubated for 2–3 weeks at 37 °c. cell colonies were visualized by staining with 0.5 ml of p-iodonitrotetrazolium violet staining
(sigma).
transfection and luciferase assay—hct-116 cells were plated in

6-well plates at 2 ⫻ 105 cells/well in mccoy’s 5a medium supplemented
with 10% fetal bovine serum. after growth for 16 h, plasmid mixtures
containing 0.5 ␮g of promoter linked to luciferase, 0.5 ␮g of expression
vector, and 0.05 ␮g of prl-null (promega) were transfected by lipofectamine (invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. after
48 h of transfection, the cells were harvested in 1⫻ luciferase lysis
buffer, and luciferase activity was determined and normalized to the
prl-null luciferase activity using a dual luciferase assay kit (promega).
for the ppar␥ ligand treatments, cells were treated with ppar␥
ligand in the absence of serum for 24 h and assayed for luciferase
activity.
rna stability in the presence of  xxxd1800xxx  d—when reaching
60 – 80% confluence in 10-cm plates, the cells were grown in the absence
of serum for 24 h and then treated with either vehicle or tgz (5 ␮m) for
2 h. the transcription inhibitor,  xxxd1800xxx  d (5 ␮g/ml), was treated at
the indicated time points. total rnas were isolated using trizol reagent (invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. for northern blot analysis, 20 ␮g of total rna was denatured at 55 °c for 15 min
and separated in a 1.0% agarose gel containing 2.2 m formaldehyde and
transferred to hybond-n membrane (amersham biosciences). after
fixing the membrane by uv, blots were prehybridized in hybridization
solution (rapid-hyb buffer; amersham biosciences) for 1 h at 65 °c
followed by hybridization with cdna labeled with [␣-32p]dctp using
random primer extension (decaprimeii kit; ambion). the probes used
were full-length human egr-1 fragment. after 4 h of incubation at
65 °c, the blots were washed once with 2⫻ ssc/0.1% sds at room
temperature and twice with 0.1⫻ ssc/0.1% sds at 65 °c. messenger
rna abundance was estimated by intensities of the hybridization
bands of autoradiographs using scion image (scion image co.). equivalent loading of rna samples was confirmed by hybridizing the same
blot with a 32p-labeled  xxxg861xxx 
probe, which recognizes rna of ⬃1.3 kb.
western blot analysis—the level of protein expression was evaluated using western blot analysis with egr-1,  xxxg686xxx , egr-3, ppar␥1,
pten, and phospho-erk antibodies. cells were grown to 60 – 80%
confluency in 10-cm plates followed by 24 h of additional growth in the
absence of serum. cells were treated with indicated compounds, and
total cell lysates were isolated using 0.1 m tris/ph 8.0 containing
proteinase inhibitors (sigma). after sonication of samples, proteins (30
␮g) were separated by sds-page and transferred for 1 h onto nitrocellulose membrane (schleicher & schuell). the blots were blocked
overnight with 5% skim milk in tbs-t (tris-buffered saline/tween
0.05%), and probed with each antibody for 2 h at room temperature.
after washing with tbs-t, the blots were treated with horseradish
peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody for 1 h and washed several
times. proteins were detected by the enhanced chemiluminescence system (amersham biosciences). western analysis for p53 was described
previously (29).
preparation of nuclear extracts and electrophoretic mobility shift
assay (emsa)—nuclear extracts were prepared as described previously (30). for the gel shift assay, double stranded oligonucleotides
were end-labeled with [␥-32p]atp by t4 polynucleotide kinase (new
england biolabs). assays were performed by incubating 10 ␮g of nuclear extracts in the binding buffer (geneka biotechnology) containing
200,000 cpm of labeled probe for 20 min at room temperature. to assure
the specific binding of transcription factors to the probe, the probe was
chased by 50-fold molar excess of cold wild type or mutant oligonucleotide. for the supershift experiments, egr-1 antibody (geneka biotechnology) was incubated with nuclear extracts on ice for 30 min before
adding to the binding reaction. samples were then electrophoresed on
5% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels with 0.5⫻ tbe (tris/borate/
edta), and gels were dried and subjected to autoradiography.
nuclear run-on—hct-116 cells were grown in the absence of serum
for 24 h and treated with 5 ␮m tgz or vehicle for 3 h. nuclei were
isolated as described previously (30). in vitro nuclear run-on transcription was carried out using 1 ⫻ 107 nuclei and 250 ␮ci of [␣-32p]utp in
transcription-optimized buffer (p118a; promega). the reaction was performed at 30 °c for 30 min. labeled transcripts were purified using
trizol reagent (invitrogen) according to manufacturer’s protocol. a
total of 1 ⫻ 107 cpm elongated nascent rna per assay was hybridized
for 24 h at 65 °c to filter-immobilized 5 ␮g of plasmid dna. the filters
were washed with 2⫻ ssc/0.1% sds for 20 min, followed by 0.1⫻
ssc/0.1% sds for 40 min. the autoradiographs were subjected to
densitometric analysis using scion image.

 xxxd3448xxx  inhibits clonogenic growth and induces apoptosis in hct-116 cells—we examined the correlation between tgz-induced apoptosis and tgz-induced anti-tumorigenesis in hct-116 cells. anti-tumorigenic activity was
measured by soft agar assay, whereas apoptosis was measured
by flow cytometry. as shown in fig. 1a, tgz treatment in
hct-116 cells dramatically inhibited the growth of hct-116
cellsonsoftagar.thegrowthinhibitionbytgzwasconcentrationdependent, and 5 ␮m tgz completely inhibited the growth of
hct-116 cells in soft agar assays. to determine whether tgz
induces cell cycle arrest and/or apoptosis in hct-116 cells, flow
cytometry analysis was performed (fig. 1b). apoptosis and g1
cell cycle arrest were observed as early as 12 h after treatment
with 5 ␮m tgz. the stimulation of apoptosis and g1 cell cycle
arrest by tgz are consistent with previous publications (8, 31)
reporting that tgz induces apoptosis and cell cycle arrest in
human colon and breast cancer cells.
expression of anti-tumorigenic proteins mediated by tgz—
one logical mechanism by which tgz exerts anti-tumorigenesis is the up-regulation of anti-tumorigenic proteins. to address this question, we measured the expression of known
anti-tumorigenic proteins, egr-1, pten, and p53. hct-116
cells were treated with 5 ␮m tgz at indicated time points, and
western analysis was performed. as shown in fig. 2a, egr-1 is
induced dramatically within 3 h, and longer treatment, up to
24 h, results in a decrease of egr-1 expression. tgz-induced
egr-1 expression was also seen in northern analysis using
hct-116 cells treated with 5 ␮m tgz for 2 h (data not shown).
we also measured pten and  xxxg2313xxx  gene expression. pten is only marginally induced at an early time
point, whereas p53 expression is not altered by tgz in hct-

116 cells. taken together, these results suggest that egr-1
induction by tgz may be pivotal to the anti-tumorigenic activity of tgz. because tgz is a ppar␥ ligand, we next compared
tgz to other ppar␥ ligands with regard to egr-1 induction.
hct-116 cells were treated with several ppar␥ ligands, brl,
pgj2, paf, ciglitazone, and  xxxd1367xxx ,
for 3 h. these ppar␥ ligands are reported to bind and activate
ppar␥ transcription factor (32, 33). consistent with previous
data, egr-1 induction was seen in tgz-treated cells, but poor or
no induction was observed in other ppar␥ ligand-treated cells
(fig. 2b), suggesting that egr-1 induction by tgz may be
independent of ppar␥. in addition, the expression of other egr
family proteins,  xxxg686xxx  and egr-3, was not altered by tgz and
other ppar␥ ligands, indicating that the effect of tgz is specific for egr-1.
tgz induces dna binding affinity of egr-1—to address
whether egr-1 protein, produced by tgz-treated hct-116
cells, has potential binding activity to the egr-1 consensus
sequences, emsa was performed. because egr-1 protein increases in the presence of tgz, the protein should bind to the
egr-1 consensus binding site. as shown in fig. 3a, oligonucleotides containing two copies of egr-1 binding sites were generated and used as a probe. nuclear extracts prepared from 5 ␮m
tgz treatment at different time points (fig. 3b, lanes 2–5) and
the recombinant proteins, egr-1,  xxxg686xxx , and egr-3, generated
by in vitro translation (fig. 3b, lanes 6 – 8), were used for the
emsa. using nuclear extracts from tgz-treated hct-116 cells
and a probe corresponding to the egr-1 binding site, results
show multiple dna䡠protein complexes with a mobility shift
(fig. 3b, arrows ␣ and ␤). compared with in vitro synthesized
egr proteins, the shifted band ␣ correspond to egr-1 proteins,
whereas ␤ indicates egr-3 proteins. interestingly, a shifted

b, gel shift assay was performed using a nushift egr-1 kit (geneka biotechnology) with tgz-treated hct-116 nuclear extracts. nuclear extracts
were prepared from hct-116 cells after tgz treatment. ten ␮g of nuclear extracts from the indicated time points were incubated with a
32
p-labeled double-stranded oligonucleotide corresponding to the two egr-1 binding sites (lanes 2–5). as a control, gel shift assay was performed
using in vitro translated (ivt) egr-1,  xxxg686xxx , and egr-3 proteins (lanes 6 – 8). arrow ␣ indicates egr-1, whereas arrow ␤ indicates egr-3. c,
competitions were done in the presence of 50 molar excess of non-radiolabeled oligonucleotide corresponding to the wild type (wt) or mutant egr-1
oligonucleotide (mu) shown in a. the binding reactions were resolved by 5% nondenaturing acrylamide electrophoresis. supershift assays were
performed by a 30-min pre-incubation of the reaction mixture with 2 ␮g of egr-1 antibody (ab) (geneka biotechnology), prior to the addition of
radiolabeled probe. the arrows indicate shifted bands, whereas ss indicates supershifted bands. nuclear extracts (ne) were used from two
different cell lines, h for 3 h of tgz-treated hct-116 cells, and k for  xxxd2925xxx -treated k562 cells.

band representing egr-1 was seen only at the 3-h time point,
whereas egr-3 was constitutively expressed during the time
course. a shifted band representing  xxxg686xxx  was not detected in
tgz-treated hct-116 cells. these results are consistent with
egr-1 induction at the 3-h time point after tgz treatment as
assessed by western analysis. these bands represent a specific
protein binding to the egr-1 sequence elements, because complex formation was diminished by the addition of 50 molar
excess of non-radiolabeled identical competitor but not by addition of the identical oligonucleotide in which the egr-1 sites

were point-mutated (fig. 3c, lanes 2 and 3). to confirm that
egr-1 binds to these sites, we performed a gel shift assay in the
presence of egr-1 antibody to demonstrate supershifting. as
shown in fig. 3c, the egr-1 antibody supershifted the band
(lanes 4 and 6). this indicates that the shifted bands (ss)
contain egr-1 protein. as a control, we examined egr-1 binding
affinity using nuclear extracts from  xxxd2925xxx -treated k562 cells and observed similar results
as with the nuclear extracts from tgz-treated hct-116 cells
(fig. 3c, lanes 5 and 6). it has been shown that egr-1 is induced

egr-1 induction by  xxxd3448xxx

by  xxxd2925xxx -treated k562 cells
(34). taken together, tgz specifically induces egr-1, and the
induced egr-1 can bind to the egr-1 consensus sequence as
assessed by emsa.
tgz induces the transactivation of egr-1—the transactivation activity of egr-1 in tgz-treated hct-116 cells was determined using an egr-1-responsive reporter. the plasmid
pebs14luc contained four copies of egr-1 response elements
linked to the basal promoter followed by a luciferase reporter
gene (fig. 4a) (35). to determine whether the expression of
egr-1,  xxxg686xxx , and egr-3 proteins could activate the luciferase
reporter, the plasmid pebs14luc was transfected into hct-116
cells, in combination with empty, egr-1,  xxxg686xxx , or egr-3 expression vectors. as shown in fig. 4b, the luciferase activity was
increased by overexpression of egr-1,  xxxg686xxx , and egr-3 compared with vector-transfected cells, suggesting that overexpression of egr family proteins is able to bind and transactivate
the reporter vector. subsequently, to determine whether tgz
induced egr-1 expression would also transactivate the reporter
vector containing egr-1 binding sites, we transfected the reporter vector and treated with varying concentrations of tgz.
indeed, tgz induced luciferase activity in a concentration-dependent manner, with 4- and 12-fold induction observed with
10 and 20 ␮m tgz treatment, respectively. because tgz is a
ppar␥ ligand, we tested whether other ppar␥ ligands would
also induce luciferase activity. we examined brl, pgj2, and

paf, which have been known to bind to ppar␥. tgz is the
strongest egr-1 inducer of luciferase activity (fig. 4d), although the other compounds are better ppar␥ ligands in terms
of ppar␥ binding activity. however, in this system, 10 ␮m tgz
is required to see any significant luciferase induction, compared with 5 ␮m tgz being used for western and northern
analyses. this system is an artificial construct and may require
higher concentration of tgz to see effects. taken together with
previous results, these data demonstrate that tgz not only
induces egr-1 expression and binding activity but also transactivates egr-1 responsive genes.
tgz induces egr-1 at the transcription level but not other
ppar␥ ligands—we performed nuclear run-on experiments to
examine whether the egr-1 induction by tgz is regulated at a
transcriptional level. hct-116 cells were treated with serumfree medium for 24 h followed by treatment with tgz or vehicle
for 3 h. radioactive-labeled nascent transcripts were analyzed
by hybridization to immobilized dnas. egr-1 gene transcription at 3 h after tgz treatment was increased 2-fold, as determined by triplicate independent experiments. the gene for sp1
transcription factor was used as an internal control, because
sp1 expression is not altered by tgz treatment in hct-116
cells (data not shown). thus, egr-1 transcripts were induced by

egr-1 induction by  xxxd3448xxx 

was cloned into the luciferase reporter gene. a plasmid,
pegr1260/luc, was transfected into hct-116 cells, and several ppar␥ ligands were treated. as shown in fig. 5b, tgz
enhances egr-1 promoter activity 2-fold, whereas the other
ppar␥ ligands do not enhance promoter activity significantly.
taken together with the nuclear run-on experiments, these
results suggest that tgz induces egr-1 expression at the transcription level by at least 2-fold. however, these data do not
fully explain the dramatic induction shown in western analysis
(fig. 2), indicating that tgz may be involved with other mechanisms of egr-1 induction.
tgz induces egr-1 at the post-transcription level—because
tgz affects minimum induction at the egr-1 promoter, and
egr-1 proteins were dramatically induced in hct-116 cells, it
is possible that tgz may increase egr-1 mrna stability. hct116 cells were treated with either tgz or vehicle for 2 h and
then 5 ␮g/ml of  xxxd1800xxx  d was added at the indicated time
points. fig. 6, a and b demonstrates that the half-life of egr-1
mrna in control hct-116 cells was ⬃15 min compared with
48 min in tgz-treated cells. these results suggest that an
increase in stability of egr-1 mrna is also a major factor in the
induction of egr-1 proteins by tgz. therefore, tgz-induced
egr-1 promoter activity and increased egr-1 mrna stability
may explain the dramatic induction of egr-1 at the protein
level.
effect of tgz on  xxxg1369xxx /2 activation, ppar␥ inactivation,
and egr-1 induction—tgz activates  xxxg1369xxx /2 activity in
smooth muscle cells (19), and the activated erk pathway induces egr-1 activity (36, 37). in addition, erk phosphorylates
ppar␥, which results in the inactivation of ppar␥ activity
(38 – 40). therefore, we speculated that tgz might increase
 xxxg1369xxx /2 phosphorylation/activation, resulting in increased expression of egr-1. in addition, the increase in erk activity by

tgz would down-regulate ppar␥ activity. the dual phosphorylation of threonine and tyrosine residues, which is necessary
for erk activation, was evaluated using the anti-phosphorylated erk antibody. to test whether tgz induces  xxxg1369xxx /2
activation in human colorectal hct-116 cells, we treated with
5 ␮m tgz at the indicated time points and measured the
phosphorylation of  xxxg1369xxx /2 using a phosphospecific antibody.
based on western blot analysis with an anti-phospho-erk
antibody, tgz activates  xxxg1369xxx /2 as early as 30 min after tgz
treatment in hct-116 cells and then decreases at later time
points (fig. 7a). however, total levels of erk proteins did not
change. to examine whether ppar␥ phosphorylation increases
concomitant with  xxxg1369xxx /2 activation, ppar␥ phosphorylation
and expression were examined. ppar␥ antibody recognizes
both phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated forms of ppar␥1
or ppar␥2. however, hct-116 cells express only ppar␥1 (40).
tgz induced maximum ppar␥1 phosphorylation at 30 min
after tgz treatment, as measured by a shift in ppar␥1 mobility (fig. 7b). this result is consistent with a previous report
that ppar␥ is phosphorylated after erk activation in hct116 cells (40). the increase in erk activation could also be
responsible, in part, for the egr-1 induction. to investigate
whether the activation of  xxxg1369xxx /2 is associated with egr-1
induction, hct-116 cells were pre-treated with protein kinase
inhibitors,  xxxd1169xxx  (mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase inhibitor),  xxxd3177xxx 
(p38 mapk inhibitor), and  xxxd2271xxx  ( xxxg2198xxx  inhibitor), for 1⁄2 h, followed by 3 h of tgz treatment. a significant
induction of egr-1 was detected as early  xxxd79xxx   xxxd1710xxx  h after the
initiation of treatment of hct-116 cells with 5 ␮m tgz. however, the egr-1 induction by tgz was abolished by pre-treatment with  xxxd1169xxx  (fig. 7c, lane 6) but not by the pretreatment of  xxxd3177xxx  or  xxxd2271xxx  (fig. 7c, lanes 7 and

8), indicating that egr-1 induction by tgz is dependent on the
erk/mapk signaling pathway. furthermore, the reporter construct containing four copies of egr-1 responsive elements was
used to measure luciferase activity after protein kinase inhibitor and tgz treatment. as shown in fig. 7d,  xxxd1169xxx  pretreatment in hct-116 cells inhibits tgz-induced egr-1 activation as assessed by the luciferase assay. this result is
consistent with western analysis for egr-1 expression as
shown in fig. 7c and indicates that tgz-induced egr-1 transactivity is dependent on the erk pathway.
discussion

although the anti-tumorigenic activities of ppar␥ ligands
are well established in human cancer, controversy exists in the
literature with regard to the relative contributions of nuclear
receptor-dependent (13, 41, 42) and -independent mechanisms
(43– 45). in this report, we demonstrate that  xxxd3448xxx , a
ppar␥ agonist, induces human colorectal cancer cells to undergo apoptosis and inhibits their growth on soft agar. in an
effort to better understand the mechanisms responsible for
these cellular responses, we measured the expression of several
tumor suppressor proteins and found that tgz but not other
ppar␥ ligands stimulates the expression of egr-1, a transcription factor involved in cell growth. tgz uniquely stimulates the
erk pathway that down-regulates the ppar␥ receptor activity
(fig. 7b), indicating that the increased expression of egr-1 is
not mediated by the activity of ppar␥ receptor (fig. 8). furthermore, tgz-dependent expression of egr-1 is attenuated by
inhibition of erk activation indicating that erk plays a pivotal role to induce tgz-induced egr-1 expression.
tgz differs from other thiazolidinediones in that it has the

ability to induce egr-1 (fig. 2b). of the ppar␥ agonists reported to bind to ppar␥ and activate target gene expression,
tgz is the only ligand to induce egr-1 significantly. one explanation for this difference is that tgz contains a  xxxd3521xxx 
moiety, which is a unique feature, compared with the other
ppar␥ ligands (18). one could think that tgz may exert its
egr-1 induction by virtue of its antioxidant property. however,
 xxxd3521xxx  treatment in hct-116 cells resulted in no significant
induction of egr-1 expression up to 100 ␮m concentration (data
not shown), suggesting that the egr-1 induction by tgz is not
dependent on antioxidant effect of tgz. thus, we propose the
model illustrated in fig. 8. tgz exerts it anti-tumorigenic
activity via the activation of the erk signaling pathway that,
in turn, down-regulates the ppar␥ receptor. however, the
erk pathway up-regulates the expression of the egr-1 transcription protein that elicits the anti-tumorigenic action. in
contrast, other ppar␥ agonists that do not stimulate erk
pathway but instead activate the ppar␥ receptor and alter the
expression of anti-tumorigenic proteins. thus, several mechanisms appear to be responsible for the anti-tumorigenic activity
of ppar␥ agonists, both dependent and independent of the
ppar␥ nuclear receptor. it also implies that a different family
of proteins may be responsible for the anti-tumorigenic activities of the various ppar␥ ligands.
evidence is presented to support that up-regulation of egr-1
by tgz occurs by at least two mechanisms; one is at the
transcriptional level, and the other is at the post-transcriptional level. the combination of these two mechanisms appears
to be responsible for the dramatic increase in the level of egr-1
protein observed after treatment with tgz. the fact that egr-1
induction by tgz is regulated at the transcriptional level (fig.
5) suggests that the egr-1 promoter may contain a binding site
downstream of erk. indeed, the human egr-1 promoter contains five serum response elements that mediate signal-induced activation of egr-1 gene transcription via the ternary
response factor  xxxg696xxx , which is an established substrate for
erk (35). thus, erk activation results in the activation of
 xxxg696xxx , which may induce egr-1 expression. in addition, tgz
also increases mrna stability of egr-1 3-fold (fig. 6). stability
of mrna can be mediated by several mechanisms. the control
of mrna stability can involve a/u-rich elements (are) in the
3⬘ untranslated region or specific rna stem loop motifs (46).
increased stability might be because of a reduction in the level
of proteins that destabilize egr-1 mrna or specific
mrna-binding proteins, including auf1 (47). interacting with
are may protect egr-1 mrna from degradation by endo- and
exonuclease, thereby increasing rna stability. in the present
study, tgz-mediated induction of egr-1 is dependent on
 xxxg1369xxx /2 but not p38 mapk or  xxxg2198xxx , because
 xxxd1169xxx  inhibits the tgz-induced egr-1 expression. although
p38 mapk has been reported to play a major role in the
induction of mrna stabilization through are in the 3⬘ untranslated region (48), p38 mapk pathway may not involve
egr-1 rna stability in hct-116 cells, because the inhibition of
p38 mapk pathway does not abolish the tgz-induced egr-1
expression (fig. 7c). recent studies demonstrate that erk is
also involved in the induction of mrna stability (49, 50).
therefore, erk or its downstream kinases are considered to
affect the proteins that bind to the are and induce stabilization. egr-1 has at least one are sequence in the 3⬘ untranslated region. however, further studies are required to identify
the exact molecular mechanism by which erk activation induces the stabilization of egr-1 mrna and increases the transcriptional activity of the egr-1 promoter.
egr-1 is a member of the immediate early gene response
family and encodes a nuclear phosphoprotein involved in the

fig. 8. schematic diagram of tgz effects on anti-tumorigenic activity. tgz affects several pathways shown in this study. tgz activates
ppar␥ as a ppar␥ agonist, thereby many ppar␥ responsive genes including anti-tumorigenic genes are induced. tgz also activates erk
phosphorylation, followed by the phosphorylation of ppar␥. the phosphorylation of ppar␥ leads to an inactivation of ppar␥ activity. in addition,
tgz induces egr-1 expression by erk activation, which leads to induction of the egr-1 promoter activity and stabilization of the egr-1 mrna.
therefore, the balance of these pathways may be an important factor to determine the tgz effects on cancer.

regulation of cell growth and differentiation in response to
signals such as mitogens, growth factors, and stress stimuli.
however, evidence was presented recently (20, 21, 35, 51) that
egr-1 is a pro-apoptotic protein, and the overexpression of
egr-1 results in increased susceptibility to apoptosis when
induced by an apoptotic agent (25). the molecular mechanism
by which egr-1 induces apoptosis and/or anti-tumorigenesis
has not been studied, but egr-1 can be considered as a tumor

suppressor gene (52). one logical mechanism by which egr-1
exerts anti-tumorigenesis is the transcriptional up-regulation
of anti-tumorigenic genes. several known anti-tumorigenic
proteins including pten are induced by egr-1 expression (21).
pten is induced modestly by tgz along with robust egr-1
expression (fig. 2a). egr-1 up-regulates transcription of the
 xxxg2313xxx  directly (25), but we do not observe the
p53 induction after egr-1 induction by tgz in hct-116 cells.

thus, the increased expression of this transcription factor, egr-1,
appears to play a role in the anti-tumorigenic activity of tgz, but
further evidence is required to fully support that conclusion.
the anti-tumorigenic effect of tgz is not well understood,
and there appears to be some dependence on species studied.
whereas tgz significantly inhibits tumor growth of human
tumors in, for example, hct-116 colorectal cancer cells, mcf-7
breast cancer cells, and pc-3 prostate cancer cells in immunodeficient mice (11–13), tgz stimulates colon polyp formation in
min mouse (53, 54). in our study, tgz also induces egr-1 in
mouse colorectal cancer cell, cmt-93 (data not shown), suggesting that egr-1 induction by tgz may be, at least, a common effect in both human and mouse cells. there are several
ongoing attempts to unravel this puzzle. one hypothesis is that
human and mouse cells use different downstream signaling
molecules, resulting in these two distinct outcomes. tgz-induced apoptosis is mediated by erk activation (55), whereas
tgz treatment in skeletal muscle cells does not alter erk
activity (56). although the erk pathway is linked to cell proliferation and tumorigenic activity, recent studies have shown
that erk activation can lead to arrest of cell growth by the
activation of p21 cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor. because
egr-1 expression can be pro-tumorigenic or anti-tumorigenic,
depending on target genes, tgz may have opposite effects
depending on the downstream targets of the egr-1 pathway.
another hypothesis is that the cells are actually using the same
signaling pathways, but then the cells selectively utilize different cofactors, which direct the basic signaling molecules to the
appropriate final targets. in this regard, there are two egr-1binding proteins, nab1 and nab2 (57, 58), that function as
transcriptional repressors of egr-1. therefore, either pro-apoptotic or anti-apoptotic effects of tgz may be determined by
cofactor expression. the competition and usage of these two
proteins in the same region may be one of the determinations
for the tgz-induced anti-tumorigenic activity.
in conclusion, we have shown that the ppar␥ ligand tgz,
independent of the nuclear receptor, stimulates the expression of
the transcription factor, egr-1, a protein with established tumor
suppressor activity. the expression is mediated by enhancement
of erk signaling pathway and occurs via both transcriptional
and post-transcriptional mechanisms. further investigations are
required to elucidate an understanding of how changes in egr-1
expression mediate the anti-tumorigenic activity of tgz.
