abstract: the malarial parasite plasmodium falciparum can only synthesize pyrimidine nucleotides via
the de nouo pathway which is therefore a suitable target for development of antimalarial drugs. new assay
procedures have been developed using high-pressure liquid chromatography (hplc) which enable concurrent
measurement of pyrimidine intermediates in malaria. synchronized parasites growing in erythrocytes were
pulse-labeled with [14c]bicarbonate a t 6-h intervals around the 48-h asexual life cycle. analysis of malarial
extracts by h p l c showed that incorporation of [ 14c]bicarbonate into pyrimidine nucleotides was maximal
during the transition from trophozoites to schizonts. the reaction, n-carbamyl- xxxd233xxx 
ldihydroorotate (ca-asp dho) catalyzed by malarial  xxxg319xxx  is inhibited by l-6-thiodihydroorotate
(tdho) in vitro (ki= 6.5 pm), and tdho, as the free acid or methyl ester, induces a major accumulation
of ca-asp in malaria.  xxxd243xxx , a naphthoquinone, is a moderate inhibitor of  xxxg633xxx 
in vitro (ki = 27 pm) but induces major accumulations of ca-asp and dho. pyrazofurin induces
accumulation of  xxxd2794xxx  and orotidine in malaria, consistent with inhibition of orotidine 5'-monophosphate
(omp) decarboxylase with subsequent dephosphorylation of the o m p accumulated. although tdho,
 xxxd243xxx , and pyrazofurin arrest the growth of p . falciparum, only moderate decreases in utp, ctp,
and dttp were observed. 5-fluoroorotate also arrests the growth of p.falciparum with major accumulations
of 5-fluorouridine mono-, di-, and triphosphates and the most significant inhibition of de novo biosynthesis
of pyrimidine nucleotides.

the intraerythrocytic stages of the malarial parasite
plasmodium falciparum obtain adenosine, inosine, and
hypoxanthine from the erythrocyte and are unable to synthesize
purine nucleotides de novo (scheibel & sherman, 1988).
erythrocytes do not contain significant levels of pyrimidine
nucleotides (szabados & christopherson, 199l), and the
parasite is unable to salvage pyrimidine bases or nucleosides;
pyrimidine nucleotides can only be synthesized via the de
novo pathway (scheibel & sherman, 1988). by contrast,
humans are able to synthesize pyrimidine nucleotides via the
de novo or salvage pathways. thus, inhibitors of malarial de
novo pyrimidine biosynthesis could be effective antimalarial
drugs, as the patient could still synthesize utp and ctp
from uridine.
a number of enzyme-catalyzed reactions of the de novo
pyrimidine pathway' (eq 1) can be blocked by specific
inhibitors (christopherson & lyons, 1990), but none of these

salvage synthesis of pyrimidine nucleotides from uridine and
cytidine, have precluded their use as anticancer drugs.
however, for reasons described above, the pyrimidine antagonists have considerable potential as antimalarial drugs,
with the naphthoquinone  xxxd243xxx  having undergone
successful clinical trials (hudson, 1993). we have synthesized
several potent inhibitors of the enzyme  xxxg319xxx  (ec
3.5.2.3; ca-asp -,dho, eq 1; christopherson et al., 1989)
which, as alkyl ester prodrug derivatives, induce blockade of
de novo pyrimidine biosynthesis in human ccrf-cem
leukemia cells growing in culture (brooke et al., 1990). these
dihydropyrimidine analogues, tdho and hddp, may induce
blockade of the de novo pyrimidine pathway in malaria because
malarial  xxxg319xxx  has properties similar to those of the
rodent enzyme (krungkrai et al., 1990).  xxxd243xxx  blocks
the respiratory chain of malarial mitochondria at complex
111, leading to inhibition of  xxxg633xxx 
( xxxg633xxx ; dho -,oro; hammond et al., 1985; hudson,
1993). using isolated malarial mitochondria, fry and pudney
(1992) found that  xxxd243xxx  forms a covalent adduct with
a protein of 11.5 kda, probably derived from complex 111.
pyrazofurin, as the c-nucleoside, inhibits malarial  xxxd2794xxx 
phosphoribosyltransferase (or0
omp) while the 5'monophosphate derivative inhibits omp decarboxylase (omp
ump; scott et al., 1986). pyrazofurin was an effective
antimalarial, retarding the maturation of trophozoites to
schizonts; toxicity was not affected by addition of uracil or
uridine to the culture. queen et al. (1990) found that
5-fluoroorotate (foro, ids0 = 0.042 pm) was a potent
inhibitor of the growth of p . falciparum in vitro while
5-fluorouracil (idso = 5.2 pm) was far less effective.
5-fluoroorotate was proposed to induce inhibition of  xxxd2794xxx 
phosphoribosyltransferase (or0 omp, eq 1) and  xxxg2366xxx  (dump -, xxxd3365xxx ). krungkrai et al. (1992)
tested a variety of 5-substituted  xxxd2794xxx  derivatives as inhibitors

and against p. falciparum growing in erythrocytic culture
and found 5-fluoroorotate to be the most potent in each case.
they found that 5-fluoroorotate and 5-aminoorotate eliminated parasitemia from mice infected with plasmodium
berghei.
we have developed procedures for quantification of
intermediates of the pathway for de nouo biosynthesis of
pyrimidine nucleotides in p. falciparum. malaria has been
grown in human erythrocytes in synchronized culture, and
pulse-labeling with [14c]bicarbonate has shown that the flux
through the de nouo pyrimidine pathway is maximal at the
transition from trophozoites to schizonts. parasites have been
exposed to a variety of pyrimidine antagonists during this
period, and analysis of malarial extracts by high-pressure liquid
chromatography (hplc) has provided direct evidence for
their mechanisms of toxicity.
experimental procedures

materials. l-dihydroorotate (dho), orotidine (ord),
utp, ctp, dttp, and other nucleotides were obtained from
the sigma chemical co. (st. louis, mo). the pyrimidine
antagonists pyrazofurin, 5-fluoroorotate, 5-fluorouracil, and
3-deazauridine were also from sigma. n-carbamyl-laspartate (ca-asp) was synthesized by the procedure of
christopherson et al. (1978), and l-6-thiodihydroorotate
(tdho) was made as described by christopherson et al.
(1987).  xxxd243xxx  (bw566c80) was a kind gift from dr.
w. e. gutteridge of the wellcome research laboratories
(beckenham, u.k.). sodium [14c]bicarbonate (38.6 mm,
51.8 ci/mol) was from amersham international plc (amersham, u.k.). yeast  xxxg2388xxx /
omp decarboxylase was from sigma. for growth of p.
falciparum, human o+erythrocytes and serum were obtained
from the australian red cross society blood transfusion
service (sydney, australia), rpmi 1640 medium (bicarbonate-free and containing 25 mm k.hepes buffer) was from
flow laboratories (sydney, australia), and the gas mixture
90% n2/5% 02/5% cozwas from commonwealth industrial
gases (sydney, australia). all other chemicals were of
analytical reagent grade.
growth of malaria in culture. plasmodium falciparum
k1, resistant to chloroquine, was obtained as a synchronized
culture in human o+ erythrocytes from the army malaria
research unit (ingelburn, australia). the hematocrit of the
erythrocytes was 4% with up to 5% parasitemia. the malaria
was grown in rpmi 1640 medium containing 25 mm k.hepes
and supplemented with 0.37 mm hypoxanthine, 25 mm
nahco3, 40 pg/ml of  xxxd2193xxx  sulfate, an additional 2
g/l of d-glucose, and o+human serum at a final concentration
of 10% (v/v). after inoculation with parasitized erythrocytes,
the culture flask was flushed with a 90% n2/5% 02/5% coa
gas mixture, sealed, and incubated at 37 "c. the culture
medium was changed every 12 h to maintain the ph in the
range 7.3-7.5. to radiolabel intermediates of the de nouo
pyrimidine pathway, the medium was changed to bicarbonatefree which had been bubbled with n2 and stirred for 16 h at
4 "c. cultures of 100 ml were then flushed with a 5% 0 2 /
95% n2 (co2-free) gas mixture, [ 14c]bicarbonate (5 1.8 ci/
mol) was added to a final concentration of 500 pm along with
a drug, as required, and the flask was sealed and incubated
for 6 h prior to harvesting.

erythrocytes (100 ml) were harvested by centrifugation (200
g, 10 min), and erythrocytes were lysed by vortexing for 1 min
in 0.15% (w/v) saponin in hanks'  xxxd2988xxx  (9
ml, ph 7.4) and left on ice for 5 min. the suspension was
then diluted to 50 ml with hanks'  xxxd2988xxx ,
and the freed parasites were harvested by centrifugation
(2 1oog, 15 min). the parasites were resuspended twice more,
and the final weight of the pellet was used to calculate the
volume. the parasites were frozen in liquid nitrogen, an equal
volume of 0.8 m hc104 was added, and the suspension was
thawed briefly at 37 oc. the suspension was frozen and
thawed twice more and and then left on ice for 15 min. after
centrifugation (2100g, 15 min), the acidic supernatant was
neutralized by vortexing for 1 min with an equal volume of
0.5 m trioctylamine in 1,1,2-trichlorotrifluoroethane(sherman & fyfe, 1989). the phases were separated by centrifugation (9000g, 5 min), and the upper aqueous phase was
retained for analysis.
high-pressure liquid chromatography. acid-soluble
metabolites were separated by gradient anion-exchange hplc
on a partisil 10-sax column (0.42 x 22 cm; whatman,
clifton, nj) and quantified using a spectra-physics uv2000
ultraviolet detector, an lkb 2140 rapid spectral detector
(bromma, sweden), and an lkb 1208 betacord radioactivity
monitor (wallac oy, turku, finland) connected in series as
described previously (sant et al., 1989). metabolite concentrations in p . falciparum were expressed as amol/
parasitized erythrocyte.
purification of  xxxg319xxx  and  xxxg633xxx . these two enzymes were partially purified from
the same culture of p. falciparum using modifications of the
initial steps of krungkrai et al. (1990, 1991). a culture of
malaria (100 ml) was harvested at the transition from
trophozoites to schizonts (27 h), and the parasites were isolated
by saponin lysis and resuspended in 3 volumes of 20 mm
k.hepes, 1 mm dtt, 1 mm edta, and 10 mm  xxxd302xxx 
(ph 7.4). the parasites were lysed by three cycles of freezethawing and the soluble and particulate fractions separated
by centrifugation (39 ooog, 30 min, 4 "c). nucleic acids
were removed from the soluble fraction by addition of
streptomycin sulfate (3% w/v), and protein from the 30% to
60% ammonium sulfate fraction was collected by centrifugation (39 ooog, 30 min, 4 "c). the pellet was redissolved in
20 mm k.hepes, 1 mm dtt, 1 mm edta, 30% (v/v)
 xxxd1896xxx , 5% (v/v) glycerol (ph 7.4) and desalted
by centrifugal ultrafiltration, and this partially purified
preparation (v,,, = 4.84 pmol n-carbamyl- xxxd233xxx 
produced/(min pl), 2.1 pg protein/pl, 99 pl) was stored at
-20 "c for  xxxg319xxx  assays. the particulate fraction
isolated above was resuspended in the same buffer (200 pl)
and triton x-100 was added to 0.15% (w/v). after stirring
(40 min, 4 " c), thedetergent extract was centrifuged (39 ooog,
30 min, 4 "c), and dho was added to 100 pm to the
supernatant (v,,, = 13.5 pmol  xxxd2794xxx  produced/(min pl)

mixtures contained (in a total volume of 25 pl) 50 mm
k.hepes (ph 7.4), 5% (v/v) glycerol, and 20 pm [14c]dihydroorotate (55.3 ci/mol), and thereaction (dho-caasp) was initiated with partially purified  xxxg319xxx  (4.2
pg of protein). three samples (7 pl) from each assay mixture
was spotted at appropriate times onto poly(ethy1eneimine)cellulose chromatograms. the [ 14c]ca-aspproduced from
[14c]dh0 in the  xxxg319xxx  assay was isolated by

oro omp ump) was initiated with partially purified
malarial dho dehydrogenase (2.1 or 3.2 pg of protein,
respectively) isolated from the particulate fraction. three
timed samples for each assay were analyzed on poly(ethyleneimine)-cellulose chromatograms using 0.4 m formic
acid as the developing solvent, and the [14c]ump produced
was quantified as for  xxxg319xxx .
determination of inhibition constants. data for inhibition
of dihydroorotaseby tdho were fitted by nonlinear regression
analysis (duggleby, 1984) to the velocity equation describing
competitive inhibition. krungkrai et al. (1 99 1) reported that
the dho dehydrogenase from p . berghei displays a ping pong
bi bi mechanism for dho and coq6. consistent with the
mechanism proposed by krungkrai et al. (1991), we have
assumed that tdho is binding competitively as an analogue
of dho and  xxxd243xxx  is binding competitively with coq6.
the inhibition constant (ki)for tdho as an inhibitor of
dho dehydrogenase was determined as a dixon plot with a
saturating concentration of coq6 (100 pm) and a subsaturating concentration of dho (10 pm). the ki value for
 xxxd243xxx  was determined as a dixon plot with a saturating
concentration of dho (100 pm) and a subsaturating
concentration of coq6 (20 pm).

results
growth of p .falciparum in the presence of [14c]bicarbonate
results in 14c-labeling of all intermediates of the de nouo
pyrimidine pathway. analysis of a perchloric acid extract of
p .falciparum by hplc gave the elution profiles for ultraviolet
absorbance and 14c shown in figure 1. both purine and
pyrimidine nucleotides have strong absorbance at 260 nm,
but only the pyrimidine nucleotides incorporate [ 14c]bicarbonate. while most of the peaks of the ultraviolet profile
have been assigned, there are at least 11 peaks representing
malarial metabolites which remain to be identified. most of
these unknown peaks are unique to malaria and are not
apparent in extracts of human cells (cf. brooke et al., 1990).
under the conditions of erythrocytic culture used, the
asexual life cycle of p . falciparum was approximately 48 h.
for a pyrimidine antagonist to have the maximum effect, the
de nouo pyrimidine pathway should be active at the time of
drug addition. to determine the period of maximum flux
through the pathway, synchronized parasites were pulselabeled with [14c]bicarbonate for 6-h intervals around the
cycle from 0 to 48 h. at zero time, a culture was divided into
eight equal volumes (100 ml) which were grown in parallel
during the 48 h of the experiment. at 6-h intervals, [14c]bicarbonate was added to one of the cultures, and 6 h later,
parasites of the culture (99 ml) were harvested. after
extraction, the eight acid-soluble extracts obtained from the
6-h intervals around the 48-h cycle were analyzed by hplc,
yielding concurrent elution profiles for ultraviolet absorbance

and 14c (figure 2). absorbance peaks, representing total
purine and pyrimidine nucleotides in the parasite, are largest
for the 18-24-h sample (figure 2g), and the incorporation of
[ 14c]bicarbonate into pyrimidine nucleotides (figure 2h) is
also maximal during this period. the rate of de nouo
biosynthesis of pyrimidine nucleotides is greatest at the
transition from trophozoites to schizonts at 24 h (figure
2g,h,q).
these procedures for measurement of intermediates of de
nouo pyrimidine biosynthesis have been used to determine the
effects upon the pathway of a variety of pyrimidine antagonists.
p . falciparum was exposed to the methyl ester of thiodihydroorotate (tdho-me, 250 pm, 6 h), and the ultraviolet
elution profile (figure 3c) indicates some decrease in the levels
of utp, ctp, and dttp, consistent with inhibition of the
pathway. the 14c-profile(figure 3d) confirms this depletion
of utp, ctp, and dttp and shows a large accumulation of
ca-asp, consistentwith inhibition of  xxxg319xxx  by tdho
and a smaller peak for dho. in addition to accumulation
of 14c-labeled ca-asp and dho, two other metabolites
accumulate (a and b) which have not been identified. the
free acid of tdho gave similar results. p .falciparum treated
with  xxxd243xxx  (25 pm, 6 h) shows a similar response with
decreases in utp, ctp, and dttp and major accumulations
of 14c-labeledca-asp and dho (figure 3e,f). the depletions
of utp, ctp, and dttp induced by these two specific
inhibitors do not seem to be sufficient to result in cell death
which could result from some other effect. for example, caasp or dho at high concentrations in p .falciparum could be
toxic or a metabolite of ca-asp or dho, perhaps peak a or
b (figure 3d), could be toxic.
pyrazofurin (250 pm, 6 h) induces moderate decreases in
utp, ctp, and dttp, and accumulations of orotidine (ord)
and  xxxd2794xxx  (oro) are apparent in both the ultraviolet profiles
and 14c-profiles(figure 3g,h). pyrazofurin has antimalarial
activity, but again, major decreases in the end-products of the
de nouo pyrimidine pathway are not observed under these
conditions. the accumulations of ord and oro are consistent
with inhibition of omp decarboxylase by pyrazofurin 5’-

a parasites were grown in synchronized erythrocytic cultures (100 ml) to the transition from trophozoites to schizonts, exposed to drug for 6 h,
harvested, extracted, and analyzed by hplc as described in experimental procedures. for each culture, the specific radioactivities (r) of ctp, cdp,
utp, and udp were calculated as the ratio r = (aci/parasitized erythrocyte (pe))/(amol/parasitized erythrocyte (pe)). average values of r obtained
for the 4 pyrimidine nucleotides in each culture were as follows: control, 10.43 f 3.59 ci/mol; methyl ester of tdho (tdho-me), 7.03 f 4.58 ci/mol;
 xxxd243xxx , 5.51 f 1.62 ci/mol; pyrazofurin, 8.27 i 2.51 ci/mol. these r values were used to calculate cellular levels of ca-asp, dho and ord/oro

p m , 6 h) induced accumulation of ca-asp and dho with a
decrease in total pyrimidine nucleotides to 41.5%. the
metabolic effects of pyrazofurin (250pm, 6 h) were less severe
with accumulations of oro plus ord and ca-asp and a decrease
in total pyrimidine nucleotides to 84.6%.
queen et al. (1990) screened 64 purine and pyrimidine
analogues, known to inhibit steps of nucleotide biosynthesis,
for inhibition of growth of p . falciparum. they found
5-fluoroorotate to be the most potent inhibitor with an ics0

value of 42 nm. to determine the mechanism of this toxicity,
p . falciparum was exposed to 5-fluoroorotate (25 pm, 6 h)
and 5-fluorouracil (25 pm, 6 h) was added to a parallel culture
for comparison. 5-fluorouracil induced only moderate
decreases in pyrimidine nucleotides as indicated by the
ultraviolet profiles or 14c-profiles (figure 4c,d, table 2).
however, large amounts of 5-fluoro-udp (a,,
= 266 nm)
and 5-fluoro-utp (a,,
= 268 nm) accumulated in malaria
treated with 5-fluoroorotate (figure 4e, table 2), and the
incorporation of [ 14c]bicarbonate into total pyrimidine nucleotides was decreased to 32.7% (figure 4f, table 2) of the
control culture (figure 4b) during the 6 h of drug exposure.
using [14c]dh0(5.56-33.3 pm) and tdho (0-25.0 pm),
with partially purified dhoase (4.2 pg protein/25 pl), a full
inhibition pattern showed tdho to be a competitiveinhibitor
with a ki value of 6.5 f 0.6 pm. a dixon plot for tdho
(0-250 pm) with partially purified dho dehydrogenase (2.1
pg protein/25 pl), 10 pm [14c]dh0, and 100 pm coqs
gave a ki value for tdho at 37.0 f 5.0 pm. a dixon plot
for  xxxd243xxx  (0-80 pm) with partially purified dho
dehydrogenase (3.2 pg protein/25 pl), 100 pm [14c]dh0,
and 20 plm coqsgave a ki value for  xxxd243xxx  of 21 f 1.6
pm.

discussion
growth of p . falciparum in human erythrocytes in the
presence of [ 14c]bicarbonate enables concurrent quantification
of the total levels of purine and pyrimidine nucleotides in the
parasite and the rate of de novo pyrimidine biosynthesis. the
gradient anion-exchange hplc procedure used to analyze
malarial extracts has revealed a number of metabolites,
currently of unknown structure, which are not found in human
cells (figure 1). in synchronized p . falciparum, the total
levels of purine and pyrimidine nucleotides and the rate of de
nouo pyrimidine biosynthesis are maximal at the transition
from trophozoites to schizonts (figure 2). consistent with
these observations, newbold et al. (1982) found that 60% of
dna synthesis in p . chabaudi occurs at or just prior to
schizogony, and gero et al. (1984) found activities of enzymes
of the pyrimidine pathway to be maximal at this stage of the
asexual growth cycle of p . falciparum. thus, specific
inhibitors of the de novo pyrimidine pathway should arrest
the growth and kill parasites at this stage of the 48-h growth
cycle.
to determine the mechanisms of cytotoxicity of tdho,
 xxxd243xxx , pyrazofurin, 5-fluoroorotate, and 5-fluorouracil,
parasites were exposed to these pyrimidine antagonists for 6
h during this transition from trophozoites to schizonts.
concurrent detection of metabolites separated by hplc by
ultraviolet absorption and radioactivity enabled quantification
of molar amounts of ca-asp, dho, and ord oro. the
approximate ics0 values in ascending order for the five
pyrimidine antagonists are  xxxd243xxx , 0.7 nm (fry &
pudney, 1991); 5-fluoroorotate, 42 nm (queen et al., 1990);
5-fluorouracil, 5.2 pm (queen et al., 1990); pyrazofurin, 6.3
pm (scott et. al., 1986); and tdho, 35 pm (data not shown).
consistent with this order,  xxxd243xxx  induced severe inhibition of the de novo pyrimidine pathway with accumulation of
ca-asp to 231 amol/parasitized erythrocyte and of dho to
15.6 amol/parasitized erythrocyte. however, the rate of de
nouo pyrimidine nucleotide biosynthesis after the blockade at
dho dehydrogenase (dho
oro; ump, udp-sugars,
cdp, udp, ctp plus utp) was still 41.5% of that of the
control culture (figure 3b,f, table l), suggesting that death
of the parasites was not due primarily to a deficiency of
pyrimidine nucleotides. the moderate inhibition of dho
dehydrogenase by  xxxd243xxx  in vitro (ki= 27 pm) supports
the proposal that inhibition of pyrimidine biosynthesis is

indirect, resulting from inactivation of complex i11 of the
electron-transport chain (fry & pudney, 1992).  xxxd243xxx 
could disrupt another unknown but essential function of the
electron-transport chain in malaria. the inhibitions of the de
nouo pyrimidine pathway induced by tdho and pyrazofurin
(table 1) also may not be sufficient to kill the parasite. caasp, dho, oro, or ord, which accumulate, or metabolites of
these intermediates, perhaps peaks a and b, which are induced
by the methyl ester of tdho (figure 3d), may be toxic.
alternatively, the moderate decreases in utp and ctp
observed may be sufficient to cause an imbalance between the
deoxynucleoside triphosphates which could result in genetic
miscoding (bebenek et a[., 1992). with the assumption that
trophozoites occupy approximately 40% of the volume of an
erythrocyte (bosia et al., 1993; 0.1 pl), the cellular concentration of ca-asp induced by the tdho methyl ester (table
1) would be approximately 115 x 10-3/0.1 x 0.4 = 2.9 mm.
the free acid of tdho is a potent inhibitor of malarial
 xxxg319xxx  (ki= 6.5 pm), but accumulation of ca-asp
in the trophozoite due to inhibition of  xxxg319xxx  may
result in development of “metabolic resistance” (christopherson & duggleby, 1983). the substrate of the inhibited
reaction (ca-asp) may accumulate to a concentration sufficient to compete with tdho for binding to  xxxg319xxx ,
resulting in restoration of the original flux through the de
novo pyrimidine pathway. tdho is also a weaker inhibitor
of dho dehydrogenase (ki = 37 pm, dho
oro); this
second inhibition “down-stream” results in accumulation of
dho (figure 3d). tdho was not detectablein theultraviolet
elution profile of figure 3c and must be present at concentrations of less than 0.05 amol/parasitized erythrocyte or
approximately 1 p m in the trophozoite.
5-fluoroorotate induced the most severe decrease in de nouo
pyrimidine synthesis to 32.7% of the control (figure 4b,f).
significant accumulations of 5-fluoro-ump, 5-fluoro-udp,
and 5-fluoro-utp were apparent in the ultraviolet profile
(figure 4e), but there was no accumulation of a pyrimidine
intermediate (figure 4 0 as observed for the other pyrimidine
antagonists. utp is a potent inhibitor of mammalian carbamyl
phosphate synthetase, which catalyzes the first reaction of
the de novo pyrimidine pathway (hco3-- cap; eq 1; lyons
& christopherson, 1985). utp also inhibits malarial carbamyl phosphate synthetase (gero et al., 1984). the 5-fluoroutp which accumulates may be a potent inhibitor of carbamyl
phosphate synthetase in malaria, blocking the pyrimidine

pathway at the first step, but this inhibition may not be
sufficient to kill the parasite. the cytotoxicity could result
from misincorporation of futp into rna or of dfutp into
dna or from inhibition of malarial  xxxg2366xxx  by
fdump. rathod et al. (1 992) have found that 5-fluoroorotate
(5 pm) induced a 50% reduction in proliferation of p .
falciparum and a 50% reduction in  xxxg2366xxx 
activity while high incorporation (9% of uridine residues) of
5-fluoroorotate into nucleic acids occurred at 1000-fold higher
concentrations. while rathod et al. (1992) proposed that
 xxxg2366xxx  is the primary target of 5-fluoroorotate
in malaria, cellular levels of fdump, dttp, and related
metabolites should be measured to obtain direct proof for this
inhibition in growing parasites.
