we examined the effect of several k+ channel blockers such as
 xxxd2215xxx ,  xxxd3394xxx , charybdotoxin (chtx), apamin, tetraethylammonium chloride (tea),  xxxd1804xxx  ( xxxd1804xxx ), and cesium on the ability of fentanyl, a clinically used selective µ-opioid
receptor agonist, to promote peripheral antinociception. antinociception was measured by the paw pressure test in male wistar rats
weighing 180-250 g (n = 5 animals per group). carrageenan (250 µg/
paw) decreased the threshold of responsiveness to noxious pressure (∆
= 188.1 ± 5.3 g). this mechanical hyperalgesia was reduced by
fentanyl (0.5, 1.5 and 3 µg/paw) in a peripherally mediated and dosedependent fashion (17.3, 45.3 and 62.6%, respectively). the selective
blockers of atp-sensitive k+ channels  xxxd2215xxx  (40, 80 and 160
µg/paw) and  xxxd3394xxx  (80, 160 and 240 µg/paw) dose dependently
antagonized the antinociception induced by fentanyl (1.5 µg/paw). in
contrast, the effect of fentanyl was unaffected by the large conductance ca2+-activated k+ channel blocker chtx (2 µg/paw), the small
conductance ca2+-activated k+ channel blocker apamin (10 µg/paw),
or the non-specific k+ channel blocker tea (150 µg/paw),  xxxd1804xxx  (50
µg/paw), and cesium (250 µg/paw). these results extend previously
reported data on the peripheral analgesic effect of morphine and
fentanyl, suggesting for the first time that the peripheral µ-opioid
receptor-mediated antinociceptive effect of fentanyl depends on activation of atp-sensitive, but not other, k+ channels.

introduction
opioids can produce analgesia by inhibiting nociceptive input at supraspinal and
spinal sites (1,2). in the central nervous system, the opening of k+ channels seems to
play a role in opioid-mediated antinociception, since the  xxxg1253xxx

blockers (sulfonylureas) antagonize the antinociceptive effect of opioids (3-6). the antinociceptive effect of opioid agonists was
also enhanced by  xxxg1253xxx 
openers such as pinacidil (7) and cromakalin
(8). evidence that some opioids induce opening of calcium-activated k+ channels has
also been obtained (9). in addition, the diverbraz j med biol res 38(1) 2005

sity of k+ channels (10) with different electrophysiological and pharmacological characteristics in neurons suggests that other types
of k+ channels may be involved in this effect.
several studies have indicated that exogenous as well as endogenous opioids can act
on peripheral nociceptors to produce an antinociceptive effect against the hyperalgesia
induced by local inflammation (11,12). although the presence of opioid receptors on
the peripheral terminals of primary afferents
has been demonstrated, the mechanism by
which opioid agonists induce peripheral antinociception is unclear (13). it was previously shown that opioid receptors at peripheral sites are coupled with inhibitory g proteins since pertussis toxin inhibits the peripheral antinociception induced by morphine
(14) and are also coupled to the l-arginineno-cgmp pathway (15,16). morphine has
been shown to exert its peripheral antinociceptive effect by also activating atp-sensitive k+ channels (17).
the purpose of the present study was to
determine whether specific and non-specific
k+ channel blockers have any effect on the
peripheral antinociception induced by fentanyl, since this drug is very potent and is
extensively used in clinical practice (18).
thus, we tested the effects of  xxxd2215xxx 
and  xxxd3394xxx , sulfonylureas that specifically block atp-sensitive k+ channels (19),
apamin, a selective blocker of small conductance ca2+-activated k+ channels (20), charybdotoxin (chtx), a blocker of large conductance ca2+-activated k+ channels (21),
and the non-selective k+ channel blockers 4aminopyridine ( xxxd1804xxx ), tetraethylammonium
chloride (tea) and cesium (22).

material and methods
animals

the experiments were performed on male
wistar rats weighing 180-250 g (from the
braz j med biol res 38(1) 2005

animal facilities of the federal university
of minas gerais, cebio-ufmg). the animals were housed in a temperature-controlled
room (23 ± 1ºc) on an automatic 12-h light/
dark cycle (lights on at 6:00 am). all testing
was conducted during the light phase (12:00
to 17:00 h). food and water were freely
available until the beginning of each experiment. naive animals were used throughout.
measurement of hyperalgesia

hyperalgesia was induced in the hind
paw by intraplantar administration of a carrageenan suspension (250 µg) and measured
according to paw pressure test (23). an analgesia meter (ugo-basile, varese, italy) with
a cone-shaped paw-presser with a rounded
tip, which applies a linearly increasing force
to the plantar surface of the paw, was used.
the weight in grams required to elicit nociceptive responses such as paw flexion was
taken to be the nociceptive threshold. a cutoff value of 300 g was used to prevent damage to the paw. the nociceptive threshold
was always measured in the right hind paw
(except when indicated) and reported as the
average of three consecutive trials recorded
before and 3 h after carrageenan injection.
the result was calculated as the difference
between these two averages (∆ of nociceptive threshold) and is reported in grams.
experimental protocol

fentanyl was administered once subcutaneously into the right hind paw 135 min
after local injection of the carrageenan suspension. all the k+ channel blockers were
injected subcutaneously into the right hind
paw. the sulfonylureas ( xxxd2215xxx  and
 xxxd3394xxx ) were administered 5 min before fentanyl while all the other k+ channel
blockers were injected 30 min after fentanyl
(5,24,25). in the protocol used to determine
whether fentanyl was acting at central sites,
carrageenan was injected into both hind paws

drugs

the drug used as the hyperalgesic agent
was lambda carrageenan (sigma, st. louis,
mo, usa) and the µ-opioid receptor agonist
was fentanyl (janssen, titusville, nj, usa).
the k+ channel blockers and their suppliers
were:  xxxd2215xxx , chtx, apamin, tea,
 xxxd1804xxx , and cesium (sigma) and  xxxd3394xxx 
(icn biomedicals inc., aurora, oh, usa).
fentanyl and carrageenan were dissolved in
isotonic saline and injected in a volume of
100 µl per paw. the k+ channel blockers
were dissolved in demineralized water immediately before use, with the exception of
sulfonylureas which were dissolved in saline and 2% tween, and injected in a volume
of 50 µl per paw. for acidic or alkaline
solutions of drops the ph was adjusted closer
to 7.

antinociceptive effect of fentanyl

the administration of fentanyl (0.5 to 3.0
µg) into the right hind paw produced an
antinociceptive response against the hyperalgesia induced by prior local ipsilateral injection of carrageenan (figure 1). fentanyl
at the dose of 1.5 µg, when administered into
the left paw, did not produce an antinociceptive effect in the right paw, whereas fentanyl

it has been suggested that the molecular
mechanism of peripheral (15) and central
(16) analgesia induced by morphine involves
activation of the l-arginine/ xxxd2738xxx /
cgmp pathway. morphine has been shown
to exert its peripheral antinociceptive effect
by activating atp-sensitive k+ channels (17).
recent studies carried out in our laboratory
demonstrated that the peripheral antinociceptive action of the  xxxd2738xxx  donor sodium nitroprusside (26) and dibutyryl cgmp
(27) is associated with atp-sensitive k+
channels, thus establishing a link between
the participation of the  xxxd2738xxx /cgmp
pathway in the analgesia induced by certain
drugs and the activation of atp-sensitive k+
channels.
the present findings demonstrate that
the sulfonylureas  xxxd2215xxx  and  xxxd3394xxx  can reverse the peripheral antinociceptive effect induced by intraplantar administration of fentanyl in rats. other k+ channel
blockers such as apamin, chtx,  xxxd1804xxx , tea,
and cesium did not exhibit any inhibitory

k+ channels and fentanyl analgesia

effect. the doses of the ineffective blockers
are compatible with those used to examine
the involvement of potassium channels in
the inhibitory prejunctional effect of a µopioid agonist on peripheral sensory nerves
in vivo (25), and in peripheral antinociception by morphine (17).
a growing number of both experimental
and clinical studies have demonstrated that
locally administered opioids produce pronounced analgesic effects by interacting with
peripheral opioid receptors (11-13,28). according to stein (29), µ-opioid agonists are
more potent than delta or kappa agonists in inducing
peripheral antinociceptive effects. thus, we
used fentanyl because it has been described
as an agonist of µ-opioid receptors (30) and
has been extensively used as an analgesic
(18).
many strategies can be used to exclude
the central effects of opioids (29). in the
present study, we used the strategy of evaluating the efficacy of ipsi- versus contralateral paw administration because the route
and site of administration would be the same.
carrageenan was administered into both hind
paws, thus creating the same tissue conditions and providing an equal possibility that
fentanyl would reach sites outside the injected paw. since the nociceptive threshold
was always measured in the right hind paw,
fentanyl at a dose of 1.5 µg was ineffective
when administered into the contralateral paw,
suggesting that at this dose fentanyl has a
peripheral site of action in inflamed tissue.
this effect seems to be specific and receptor
mediated, since 50 µg naloxone (when injected into the right paw, but not into the
left), totally blocked the antinociceptive effect of fentanyl (data not shown).
patch-clamp studies have shown that the
sulfonylureas are selective inhibitors of atpsensitive k+ channels in pancreatic ß-cells,
cardiac myocytes and skeletal muscle cells
(19). indeed, the sensitivity to sulfonylureas,
especially the potent  xxxd2215xxx , is commonly used to characterize the  xxxg1253xxx 

95

(31). however,  xxxd2215xxx  also blocks an
atp-independent k+ current in a human
neuroblastoma cell line (32) and a delayed
rectifier k+ current in neural and cardiac
cells (33). blockade of these currents might
mimic the effects expected from katp blockade, thus potentially confusing the interpretation of the results. delayed rectifying k+
channels are blocked by tea,  xxxd1804xxx  and
cesium (34) and if fentanyl were acting
through the activation of these channels both
sulfonylureas and these other blockers should
reverse this effect.
it has been demonstrated that  xxxd2215xxx  cannot bind directly to µ-, delta- or kappaopioid receptors because this drug cannot
alter the binding of specific agonists of these
receptors (35). the effect of sulfonylureas
against fentanyl-induced antinociception
should not be interpreted as a counteraction
by a possible increased excitability induced
by the blockers, since these drugs do not
cause any hyperalgesic effect when administered alone. our results are consistent with
reports (36) describing  xxxd2215xxx  as more
potent in blocking atp-sensitive k+ channels than  xxxd3394xxx  in pancreatic ß-cells
and in smooth and cardiac muscle. in the
present study, the maximum dose of  xxxd2215xxx  (240 µg/paw) did not significantly
alter the plasma glucose levels (data not
shown). furthermore, all sulfonylureas tested
to date, when administered by the intracerebroventricular or intrathecal route, dose dependently antagonized the antinociception
induced by systemic administration of fentanyl (4,37), suggesting that opening of atpsensitive k+ channels in neurons of the central nervous system underlies the antinociceptive effect of fentanyl. interestingly, peripheral antinociception of bremazocine, a
kappa-opioid, is not due to k+ channel activation
(38).
in the present study, apamin, a protein
extracted from  xxxd2216xxx  and a selective
blocker of small conductance ca2+-activated
k+ channels (20), and chtx, a toxin that
braz j med biol res 38(1) 2005

96

a.r.a. rodrigues et al.

blocks large conductance calcium-activated
k+ channels (21), failed to antagonize the
peripheral antinociceptive effect induced by
the selective µ-opioid receptor agonist fentanyl. it was demonstrated that activation of
chtx-sensitive, but not apamin-sensitive k+
channels may be the mechanism through
which µ-opioid receptor agonists exert prejunctional modulation of sensory nerves in
guinea pig airways (9). these investigators
(9) also suggested that activation of the same
type of k+ channel could be involved in the
modulation of pain sensation by opiates. our
results disagree with this hypothesis and exclude the involvement of both types of ca2+activated k+ channels in the peripheral antinociception induced by fentanyl. according
to others (39), chtx is not specific for the
large conductance ca2+-activated k+ channels, but blocks a number of other k+ channels.
our results show that  xxxd1804xxx , tea, and
cesium administered intraplantarly had no
significant effect on the peripheral antinociception induced by fentanyl. these drugs
block different types of k+ channels, includ-

ing calcium-activated and voltage-dependent k+ channels, although they are not specific for any of them in particular (22). ocaña
et al. (4) showed that  xxxd1804xxx  and tea have no
effect on the central antinociception induced
by µ-opioid receptor agonists, including fentanyl. finally, k+ channels activated by µopioid agonists are not sensitive to  xxxd1804xxx  or
tea (40).
thus, we have shown that two different
sulfonylureas,  xxxd2215xxx  and  xxxd3394xxx , antagonized the peripheral antinociceptive effect induced by the µ-opioid receptor agonist fentanyl in rats, suggesting that
atp-sensitive k+ channels play an important role in this effect. it is important to
consider that other potassium channels such
as g protein-coupled channels might be involved. since other k+ channel blockers
failed to reverse this effect it may be inferred
that other types of k+ channels such as large
conductance ca2+-activated, small conductance ca2+-activated and voltage-dependent
k+ channels appear not to be involved in the
peripheral antinociceptive effect of fentanyl.
