summary-through
the treatment of rat testicular microsomes with sodium  xxxd1685xxx , 3/y-hydroxy-5ene-steroid dehydrogenase and s-ene-4-ene isomerase (abbreviated as the 38-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase and isomerase, respectively) were solubilized, and then purified by deae and hydroxylapatite
column chromatographies. the findings were as follows:
1. with this purification procedure, the 3~-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase activity could not be
separated from the isomerase.
2. for 3-oxo-l-ene-steroid
formation from 3@-hydroxy-s-ene-steroids, nad+ was required as a

cofactor. while the 3/?-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase required nad+, the isomerase also required
nad+ or its reduced form, in contrast to the microbial enzyme.
3. on treatment

of the purified enzyme with 5’-p-fluorosulfonyl-benzoyladenosine

(fsba), both

enzyme activities were markedly reduced.
4. the enzvme. affinitv labeled with fadenine-8-‘%lfsba, showed a mol. wt of 44.8 k.
5. during -4-a~droste~~ione
production from idha, 5- xxxd2618xxx ~ione was detected

as an

inte~ediate.

introduction
3~-hydroxy-5-ene-steroid
dehydrogena~
(3/i-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase) and 5-ene-4-ene isomerase (isomerase) catalyze an obligatory step of steroid
hormone biosynthesis in both the 4-ene and 5-ene
pathway, it is known that the enzyme activities in
the testis are enhanced on the administration
of
lmman  xxxd2228xxx  to immatu~ rats [l]
and x-ray irradiated mature rats 123. intra~llularly,
the dehydrogenase and isomerase activities are abundant in the microsomal fraction [3,4], furthermore,
we established that those enzyme activities together
with those of 17u-hydroxylase,
c-17-c-20 lyase
and 17~-hydroxysteroid
dehydrogenase are exclusively present
in smooth-surfaced

surfaced endoplasmic reticula were found to be abundant [7].
previously, we solubilized the 3~-hydroxysteroid
dehydrogenase with the isomerase from testicular
microsomes using brij 58, and reported that the
molecular weight of this solubilized enzyme is 260 k
on gel filtration chromatography [s].
in this paper, we report the purification of the
testicular enzymes and an attempt to clarify the
characteristics of the enzymes at the molecular level,
and compare the latter with those of the rat
adrenal [9] and microbial enzymes.

exprrimental
chemicals
[4-i4c]dha (5 1.8 mci/mmol) and 5’-p-[adenine-8“c]fluorosulfonylbenzoyladenosine
(43.2 mci/mmol)
were obtained from new england nuclear (u.s.a.).
the [‘4cjmethyiated protein mixture (29.5-58.0 ,uci/
mg protein each; mol. wt 14,30~2~,000)
was purchased from amersham (u.k.). 5-progesterone and
s-androstenedione were obtained from research plus
(u.s.a.), and other steroids were purchased from
steraloids (u.s.a.). a11 solvents were used after
redistillation.

proteolysis of the enzyme. the purification procedures were all carried out to 4°c.
the testes of male rats of the wistar strain (90-days
old) were obtained and homogenized in 10 mm potassium phosphate buffer (ph 7.5) containing 0.25 m
sucrose, 0.1 mm edta and 0.1 mm dithiothreitol.
the homogenate was centrifuged  xxxd1891xxx ,000 g for
i5 min, and then the supematant fraction was centrifuged at 105,000 g for 60 min. the obtained precipitate was washed with the same medium as that used
for homogenization,
and used as the microsomes.
the microsomes were suspended in 100 mm potassium phosphate buffer (ph 7.5) containing 20%
glycerol, 0.1 mm edta and 0.1 mm dithiothreitol.
the concentration of microsomal protein was adjusted to lomg/ml. the 3#?-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase and isomerase were solubilized from the
microsomes by means of the addition of sodium
 xxxd1685xxx  (final concentration, 0.6%). the solubilized
proteins were obtained by centrifugation at 105,000 g
for 1 h.
the solubilized fraction was applied to a column
of tsk gel-deae toyopearl 650 s (toyo soda,
japan), which had been equilibrated with 20mm
potassium phosphate buffer (ph 7.5) containing 20%
glycerol, 0.1 mm edta, 0.1 mm dithiothreitol,
0.01 mm nad+ and 0.2% sodium  xxxd1685xxx . the
column was washed with the same buffer as that used
for the equilibration. the fractions containing the
enzyme activities were eluted with the same buffer
containing 0.4% emulgen 913 (kao atlas, japan),
pooled and then diluted with the same volume of a
20%  xxxd2216xxx . the preparation was applied
to a column of hydroxylapatite (bio rad, f.r.g.),
which had been equilibrated with 10 mm potassium
phosphate buffer (ph 7.5) containing 20% glycerol,
0.1 mm edta, 0.1 mm dithiothreitol,
0.01 mm
nad+ and 0.2% emulgen 913. elution was carried
out with a linear concentration gradient of from 10
to 70mm potassium phosphate buffer (ph 7.5).

enzyme assays
for the activity of the 3fi-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase together with that of the isomerase,
the in vitro production
of radioactive 4- and
5-androstenediones
from [4-14c]dha at 37-c was
quantitated as previously reported [lo].
the 3/?-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase activity was
assayed spectrophotometrically at 25°c by measuring
the time-dependent change in absorbance at 340 nm
in 100mm potassium phosphate buffer (ph 7.5),
20% glycerol, 0.1 mm edta, 1 mm nad+ and
0.1 mm dha. the enzyme activity was expressed as
nmol of nadh formed per min using a molecular
extinction coefficient for nadh of 6,200.
the steroid isomerase activity was assayed at 25°c
by measuring the time-dependent increase in absorbance at 248 nm due to 4-ene-3-oxosteroid
(progesterone) formation in 100mm potassium phosphate buffer (ph 7.5) 20% glycerol, 0.1 mm edta,
0.1 mm nad+ and 20 pm 5-progesterone. the enzyme activity was expressed as nmol of progesterone
formed per min using a molecular extinction
coefficient of 16,300.
the protein concentration determination and other
analytical methods were the same as those described
previously [9].

the testicular microsomes were treated with 0.6%
sodium  xxxd1685xxx  for 30 min at 4°c which resulted in
almost complete solubilization with no loss of the
enzyme activities. the solubilized preparation was
subjected to deae-toyopearl anion exchange chromatography, the 38 -hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase

the enzyme activity was measured with [‘%]dha as the substrate. after incubation,
steroids were extracted with ch,ci,, and then separated by thin-layer chromatography.
the radioactivities
of dha, and 4- and 5-androstenediones
were quantitated.

dehydrogenase
and isomerase activities was simultaneously eluted, as shown in fig. 1b.
after hydroxylapatite
chromatography,
the final
enzyme preparation
(fraction no. 24) exhibited the
activities of the 3/?-hydroxysteroid
dehydrogenase
and the isomerase. the protein concentration
of the
enzyme preparation
could not be determined
at the
final step because of the very low content and the
presence of the detergent. from results of the enzyme
assay, the isomerase activity was found to be 10 times
as much as the 3/?-hydroxysteroid
dehydrogenase
activity in this fraction. in table 1, the purification
of the testicular 38-hydroxysteroid
dehydrogenase
is
summarized.
the final enzyme preparation
gave two
major bands (corresponding
to 46.8 k and 53.8 k)
with a few minor bands on sds-polyacrylamide
gel
electrophoresis.

in the presence
of 0.1 mm nad+,

and a less polar metabolite were

method
(fig. 2).
the less polar metabolite
showed an identical
mobility on thin layer chromatography
to that of
authentic
5-androstenedione.

production
of 4-progesterone
from
s-progesterone
by the isomerase (final preparation)
was dose-dependently
enhanced by the addition of
nad+ (fig. 4a) or nadh (data not shown). however, no oxidoreduction
of the cofactors
was observed spectrophotometrically
during the isomerization. when 5-progesterone
was incubated with the
enzyme preparation
in the absence of nad+, a
limited amount of 4-progesterone
was formed, as
shown in fig. 4b. nadp+,
nadph
and related
nucleotides enhanced the isomerization
by the same
preparation

nad(h).

we examined
the influence of fsba upon the
38-hydroxysteroid
dehydrogenase
and isomerase activities of the purified enzyme. after treatment of the
enzyme preparation
with fsba, the mixture was
subjected to gel filtration in order to remove unbound
fsba. the enzyme bound to fsba lost both the
activities
to almost the same extents (table 2).
nad(p)+ protected the enzyme from the inactivation
by fsba (data not shown).

finally, the purified enzyme was treated with
[adenine-8-‘4c]-labeled fsba and then heated with a
1% sds solution at 100°c for 3 min. then it was
subjected to sds polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.
the resultant gel was autoradiographically
examined
to detect protein band(s) containing bound radioactive fsba. a single band was detected on the gel,
besides the free radioactive fsba. the molecular
weight of the enzyme bound to [14c]fsba was estimated from its mobility to be 46.8 k (fig. 5).

the isomerase activity, even though a single
protein bound to fsba was detected on sdspolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. in the eluate on
both ion-exchange
and hydroxylapatite
chromatography, no other metabolic enzyme than the
dehydrogenase was detected when [14]dha was used
as the substrate. further purification by means of
affinity chromatography [9] was not successful in the
case of the testicular enzymes, because of the very low
enzyme protein concentration in the final preparation. as nad+ was required for the two enzyme
activities with similar concentration
dependencies,
fsba, an affinity labeling reagent for nad(h)dependent enzymes, decreased both activities to similar extents by binding to the enzyme. these results
suggest the possibility of a single protein with the two
enzyme activities.

treatment but without fsba.

for production of  xxxd176xxx 
from dha,
dehydrogenation of the 3b-hydroxy group seems to
be rate limiting, because the isomerase activity was
markedly higher than the dehydrogenase activity.
the occurrence of s-androstenedione as a metabolite suggests a pathway from dha to  xxxd176xxx  via 5_androstenedione,
or dehydrogenation followed by isomerization.
in this regard,
5-progesterone was isolated as an intermediate during
4-progesterone
formation from pregnenolone
by
human placental 3p-hydroxysteroid
dehydrogenase
and isomerase [ll]. the mode of production of
s-androstenedione
showed a biphasic curve as to
the purified enzyme concentration (fig. 3a) and a
bell-shaped curve as to the concentration
of the
microsomes (fig. 3b), even though the end product,
4_androstenedione,
was formed enzyme-concentration dependently in both cases. in the presence of
nad+, the isomerization of 5-progesterone was
markedly enhanced (fig. 4b). on the other hand, the
reverse reaction from  xxxd176xxx 
to dha
could not be detected in the present ex~~ment,
even though the reverse reactions were reported
previously [12]. this paradoxical
result may be
explained by the higher activity of the isomerase than

that of the 3/?-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase in the
purified preparation.
in the present experiment, nad(h) was found to
be essential for the isomerization of s-progesterone to
4-progesterone by the isomerase purified from the
testicular microsomes. in the case of rat adrenal
isomerase, the requirement of nad+ and nadh
was also confirmed [9], this requirement of nad(h)
is entirely distinct from in the case of an isomerase
isolated from pseudomonas testosteroni (131. nad+
itself caused no spectrophotometric change during
the ~some~zation, whereas nad+ was required for
dehydrogenation of the 3fi-hydroxy group as a hydrogen acceptor. from these results, the allosteric
effect of nad(h) upon the isomerase is suggested.
as an affinity labeling reagent for nad+dependent enzymes, fsba was reported to bind
covalently to lysine, cysteine and tyrosine residues
located near or at the cofactor binding site(s) of an
enzyme molecule [14]. further stoichiometric analysis
is needed to determine the number of binding site(s)
per molecule of the enzyme.
the radioactive-affinity
labeling experiment revealed that a single fsba-bound protein, most likely
the 3/i-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase together with
the isomerase, was detected. therefore, the molecular
weight of the protein which showed affinity to fsba
was estimated to be 46.8 k. this value is similar to
that of the enzyme (46.5 k) with the same functions
isolated from rat adrenal microsomes.
