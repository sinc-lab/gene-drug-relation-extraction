[effects of chronic paralysis of chick embryo by  xxxd2174xxx  on the development of the neuromuscular junction].  chronic paralysis of chick embryos by the cholinergic antagonist  xxxd2174xxx  blocks the subsynaptic accumulation of acetylcholinesterase but not the formation of acetylcholine receptor cluster.  xxxd2174xxx  paralysis also causes an increase of the total muscle content of acetylcholine receptor without altering the half-life of the receptor protein. the spontaneous activity of the embryon therefore "shuts off" the synthesis of extrasynpatic acetylcholine receptor.
