selective inhibition of monoamine neurotransmitter transporters
by synthetic local anesthetics

abstract synthetic local anesthetics (las) have been
found to have cocaine-like characteristics with some psychotomimetic action, possibly through monoaminergic neurotransmission. to gain insight into the relation between
la action and monoamine transporters, we investigated the
effect of synthetic las on neurotransmitter transporters,
including monoamine transporters. we used cloned transporter cdnas and examined transient functional expression in cos cells and stable expression in hela cells.
among the las tested, procaine and other ester-type las
inhibited [3h]da uptake and binding of [3h]2-beta-carbomethoxy-3-beta-(4-fluorophenyl)tropane (cft), a cocaine
analogue, in cos cells expressing rat  xxxg2149xxx 
(dat). the inhibition was concentration-dependent. the
inhibitory effect on [3h]da uptake was reversible and not
dependent on ph, as observed in hela cells stably expressing dat. procaine also inhibited uptake of norepinephrine
(ne) and serotonin (5-ht) by the norepinephrine transporter (net) or serotonin transporter (sert) expressed in
cos cells. on the other hand, procaine and other las had
little or no effect on [3h]gaba and [3h]glutamate uptake
in cos cells expressing mouse gaba or rat glutamate/aspartate transporter. ic50 values for [3h]da uptake inhibition correlated well with those for [3h]cft binding inhibition, but not with intrinsic anesthetic potency. kinetic
analysis of monoamine uptake inhibition by procaine in
cos cells expressing rat dat, net or sert revealed a
competitive action similar to that of cocaine. these results
demonstrate that certain las selectively inhibit monoamine
transporters. this might contribute to the cocaine-like psychotomimetic action of certain las.

introduction
monoamine neurotransmitter transporters act to terminate
synaptic neurotransmission by na+-dependent reaccumulation of released monoamines into presynaptic terminals
(iversen 1971). there are also extraneuronal monoamine
transporters in glial cells that contribute to the clearance
of released monoamines (gründemann et al. 1998). these
transporters, therefore, play an important role in maintaining fine neural tuning. it is well known that various drugs,
including such psychostimulants as cocaine and methamphetamine as well as antidepressants, act on certain neurotransmitter transporters to exert their effects on the central nervous system (langer and schoemaker 1988; horn
1990). thus, the transporter dysfunction is thought to cause
neurological and psychiatric disorders.
while cocaine is known to inhibit reuptake of all monoamine neurotransmitters, including dopamine (da), norepinephrine (ne) and serotonin (5-ht), the mood-enhancing
and psychomotor stimulation effects of cocaine are thought
to be related primarily to the inhibition of the  xxxg2149xxx  (dat; ritz et al. 1987). however, cocaine is a natural
substance with potent local anesthetic properties. therefore, it has been suggested that the effect of cocaine on
voltage-sensitive na+ channels in the central nervous system may contribute to its in vivo pharmacological action.
by comparing the action of cocaine, cocaine analogues and
synthetic local anesthetics (las) in locomotor activity, it
has been demonstrated that cocaine and cocaine analogues
display both locomotor stimulation and suppression, while
synthetic las display only locomotor suppression, suggesting that the inhibitory action probably is due to a local anesthetic action (reith et al. 1985). the inhibitory but not stimulatory action of cocaine and cocaine analogues on locomotor activity was highly correlated with their ability to
displace batorachotoxin binding to voltage-sensitive na+
channels (mcneal et al. 1985). on the other hand, some

215

las were shown to have cocaine-like reinforcing effects
in animals (ford and balster 1977; johanson 1980;
woolverton and balster 1982), even though they are not
generally recognized as indirect dopaminergic agonists,
like cocaine.
recently, woodward et al. (1995) have suggested that
the cocaine-like action of such synthetic las as dimethocaine and procaine results from their inhibitory effect on
da uptake. since these results suggest that cocaine’s psychostimulating action is not due to its local anesthetic activity, it is hypothesized that some synthetic las, like cocaine, possess reinforcing properties via inhibition of da
uptake. however, the action of las on neurotransmitter
transporters, including such monoamine transporters as
dat, ne transporter (net) and 5-ht transporter (sert),
has never been thoroughly investigated, despite suggested
links between these transporters and psychomotor activity
(langer and schoemaker 1988). in the present study, we
compared the effects of cocaine and synthetic las on various neurotransmitter transporters using cell systems constructed by introducing cloned cdna of those transporters.

materials and methods
 xxxg2148xxx  cdnas. rat dat cdna cloned in
pbluescript (shimada et al. 1991) was subcloned into pcdna3. rat
net cdna used in this study was rneta-s (kitayama et al. 1999).
rat sert cdna and rat glutamate/aspartate transporter (glast)
cdna were cloned by pcr using total rna from rat whole brain as
the template. oligonucleotide primer sets used were 5’-caggtaccccaagaaccaagagctagcctgggtcc/5’-atgggcccgagagtccacggaaagaagtggtcgga for rsert, and 5’agcgaattcgctttctggggacaagttcaagac/5’-atgctcgagacattttccaatcctatcagagtag for rglast,
which include appropriate restriction enzyme sites for subsequent
cloning. resultant pcr products were cloned into pcdna3 and selected by functional expression in cos cells. positive clones were
confirmed by nucleotide sequencing.
cell lines expressing neurotransmitter transporters. cos cells were
transfected by electroporation with 10 µg/107 or 20 µg/107 cells of
rat dat cdna, or mouse gaba transporter (gat 1) cdna subcloned into the eukaryotic expression vector pcdna i (pcdnadat,
pcdnagat 1), as previously described (schaeffer et al. 1991; shimada et al. 1991), or with 10 µg/107 cells of rat net, rat sert or
rat glast cdnas. transfected cos cells were plated in 24- or
48-well tissue culture clusters in 1000 µl or 500 µl dulbecco’s modified minimal essential medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum.
cells were cultured at 37°c under 5% co2/95% air for 2–4 days
before assay.
hela cells were used for stable expression of rat dat (hela/
dat; mitsuhata et al. 1998). hela cells were transfected with
pcdna3 carrying rat dat cdna by electroporation. the resulting
cell colonies were selected by  xxxg418xxx  and [3h]da uptake measurement. hela/dat cells were plated in 48-well tissue culture clusters
in 250 µl eagle’s modified minimum essential medium containing
10% fetal bovine serum, and cultured for 3–4 days before uptake
analysis.
uptake and binding assay. to assess the uptake of neurotransmitters, cells were washed three times in krebs-ringer-hepes buffered
solution (krh in mm: nacl, 125; kcl, 4.8; cacl2, 1.3;  xxxd2534xxx ,
1.2; kh2po4, 1.2; glucose, 5.6; hepes, 25; ph 7.4±0.1) at 37°c and
incubated with [3h]da, [3h]gaba, [3h]ne, [3h]5-ht or [3h]glutamate at a final concentration of 10, 10, 10, 10 and 20 nm, respectively, at 37°c for 10 min (kitayama et al. 1992). after that, cells

were washed rapidly three times with ice-cold krh and any radioactivity remaining in the cells was extracted with naoh, neutralized with hcl and determined by liquid scintillation counting.
nonspecific uptake of 3h-labelled da, ne, 5-ht, gaba or glutamate was determined in the presence of 100 µm cocaine, 1 mm
nipecotic acid or 1 mm glutamate, respectively. saturation analyses of monoamine uptake were performed in cos cells incubated
at 37°c in krh containing 100 nm [3h]da, [3h]ne or [3h]5-ht
with unlabelled da, ne or 5-ht (100 nm–10 µm), respectively.
binding of [3h]cft to dat was performed on whole cells in
24-well plates (kitayama et al. 1992). cells were washed three times
with ice-cold krh and incubated with 4 nm [3h]cft on ice for 2 h.
after that, cells were washed rapidly three times with ice-cold krh
and radioactivity was extracted with naoh, neutralized with hcl

results
effect of las on dat
procaine, an ester-type synthetic la, displayed concentration-dependent inhibition of da uptake (fig. 1a), though
it was less potent than cocaine. lidocaine, an amide-type
la more potent than procaine, had a weak inhibitory effect
on da uptake. we examined the effect of synthetic las on
[3h]cft binding and compared it to that of cocaine. cft,
a cocaine analogue, is known to act on dat at cocaine
recognition sites with an affinity higher than cocaine (madras et al. 1989). figure 1b shows that cocaine, procaine
and lidocaine inhibit [3h]cft binding with concentrationeffect curves similar to those of [3h]da uptake inhibition.
table 1 summarizes the effects of 11 las on dopamine
uptake and cft binding.  xxxd1869xxx , butacaine, meprylcaine, procaine and tetracaine inhibited da uptake with
ic50 values between 30 µm and 200 µm. these las also
inhibited cft binding. in general, ester-linked las tended
to have greater efficacy for inhibition of da uptake and
cft binding than did amide-linked las. there was a positive correlation between inhibition of da uptake and that
of cft binding, but not between da uptake inhibition and
reported anesthetic potency (fig. 2).
we also examined the mode by which las inhibit da
uptake in hela/dat. lowering ph in the incubation so-

this ph change, however, did not shift the inhibition curve
for procaine (fig. 3; insert panel). since the pka of procaine is 8.9 (de jong 1994), most of the procaine was
cationic in any ph solution tested. however, the basic

(fig. 1a), cells were (a) incubated with [3h]da in the presence of procaine or (b) washed with krh, then incubated
with [3h]da without procaine. in (a), [3h]da uptake was
31.2±0.4% of the control value (in the absence of procaine during preincubation and incubation periods). on

inhibited the uptake of [3h]ne and [3h]5-ht to various

effects of las on gat and glast
to determine whether las act selectively on monoamine
transporters, we evaluated the effect of las on gaba or
glutamate uptake in cos cells expressing mouse gat or
rat glast. most las tested, including  xxxd383xxx , butacaine, cocaine, ethyl 4-aminobenzoate, lidocaine, meprylcaine, prilocaine, procainamide, procaine and tricaine,
had no effect on [3h]gaba uptake up to 1 mm, except
tetracaine and  xxxd1869xxx  which showed ic50 values of
255±40 µm and 384±151 µm, respectively (n=3). although cos cells have an endogenous glutamate transport system, the introduction of rat glast caused a 2- to
2.5-fold increase in [3h]glutamate uptake. procaine and
cocaine up to 1 mm had no effect on [3h]glutamate uptake
in cos cells expressing rat glast, nor in mock (plasmid
vector only)-transfected cos cells (data not shown).
kinetic analysis of procaine inhibition
of monoamine transporters
comparing the inhibitory action of procaine to that of cocaine, we clarified the mode of action kinetically in cos
cells expressing dat, net and sert. saturation analysis
of [3h]da, [3h]ne and [3h]5-ht uptake displayed competitive inhibition by procaine as well as cocaine. table 2
summarizes the action of procaine and cocaine. both cocaine and procaine, despite different potencies, increase km
values without affecting vmax values, indicating that procaine
inhibits monoamine uptake competitively, like cocaine.

discussion
the psychostimulant action of cocaine is known to be mediated by the stimulation of monoaminergic neurons, especially via dopamine neurons by the inhibition of dat.
one line of evidence indicates that some las, including
procaine, have a discriminative effect similar to cocaine,
but with low potency (de la garza and johanson 1985;
zacny and woolverton 1989; graham and balster 1993).
since cocaine is a potent local anesthetic, these results led
to the hypothesis that the local anesthetic property of co-

caine contributes to its psychotomimetic action. however,
biochemical and behavioral studies have suggested that the
local anesthetic potency of cocaine is not correlated with
its psychostimulating action (mcneal et al. 1985; reith et
al. 1985). another hypothesis from the above observations
of la action is that some las, like cocaine, inhibit da uptake to exert their cocaine-like psychostimulant action. the
present study clearly demonstrated that some las specifically inhibit dat, like cocaine. using the neurotransmitter
transporter-expressing system, we pointed out certain features of the action of synthetic las on neurotransmitter uptake. the inhibitory action of las on da uptake was correlated well with the inhibition of the binding of cft, a cocaine analogue, known to specifically label cocaine-binding sites (madras et al. 1989), but not with la potency.
these results suggest that certain las have a direct inhibitory action on dat, and this may explain their cocainelike psychotomimetic action. differing potencies of procaine and lidocaine on dat inhibition observed in the present investigation are consistent with their differing discriminative properties reported elsewhere (huang and wilson 1982; woolverton and balster 1982; graham and balster 1993). recently, woodward et al. (1995) reported that
the las dimethocaine and procaine, as well as cocaine, inhibit da uptake in synaptosome and increase striatal
dopamine outflow as measured by in vivo microdialysis.
wilcox et al. (1999) also suggested that affinity at dat is
related to the reinforcing effects of las in rhesus monkeys.
taken together, these findings suggest that the cocaine-like
psychotomimetic actions of certain las is brought about
by their inhibition of dat.
most in vivo investigations observed the higher doses
of las to promote the psychotomimetic actions than those
of cocaine. for instance, middaugh et al. (1998) showed
the discriminative effect of procaine at doses of 100 mg/kg
in contrast to 10 mg/kg of cocaine. according to the pharmacokinetics of procaine (de jong 1994), the concentration of procaine in the brain tissues after injection of such
doses was expected to be over 100 µm, which is close to
the ic50 values of procaine in inhibiting [3h]da uptake in
cos cells expressing the rat dat observed in the present
study. taken together, it is suggested that some las revealed the reported psychotomimetic action at least partly
via inhibition of monoamine transporters.

219

the present study also demonstrated that some synthetic
las selectively inhibit monoamine transporters, like cocaine. certain las such as procaine, tetracaine and  xxxd1869xxx , but not lidocaine, revealed the inhibition of not only
dat but also net and sert. it seems likely that this inhibitory action results in an increase in overall monoaminergic neural activity. although the psychostimulant action
of cocaine is mainly due to its inhibition of dat as mentioned above, a recent study on transgenic mice lacking
dat or sert gene questioned the dopamine hypothesis of
cocaine reward (rocha et al. 1998; sora et al. 1998). cocaine still reinforced self-administration in dat knockout mice, but its locomotor-stimulating action disappeared.
since cocaine impacts all monoamine transporters, both noradrenergic and serotonergic modification might contribute
to its reinforcing property. indeed, several reports describe
the characteristics of cocaine reward examined with various serotonergic agents, suggesting that serotonin 1b
agonists may enhance cocaine’s reinforcing effects by
augmenting cocaine-induced elevations in extracellular
da concentrations (benloucif et al. 1993; cameron and
williams 1994; boulenguez et al. 1996). rocha et al. (1998)
have also suggested that increases in serotonergic neurotransmission may mediate the reinforcing effect of cocaine
in dat knock-out mice. therefore, it can be assumed that
a concomitant increase in da and 5-ht (or ne) is necessary to exert its reinforcing properties. if this is the case,
the ability to inhibit not only dat but also sert (or net)
is essential to mimic cocaine-like action. accordingly, it
is necessary to re-evaluate the properties of the action of
certain drugs that exert cocaine-like reinforcing properties. based on the reinforcing properties of procaine, the
present findings that certain las such as procaine showed
selective inhibition of monoamine transporters like cocaine offer examples that help to answer this question.
it is well known that las act on the voltage-sensitive
na+ channel at intracellular sites in cationic form. they
must pass through the plasma membrane initially in their
basic form to act at their binding site (de jong 1994). in intact cells, therefore, acidic ph prevent the las’ inhibitory
action on na+ channels by reducing the basic form. in the
present study, however, lowering ph in the incubation solution did not affect the potency of procaine in inhibiting
da uptake in hela cells expressing rat dat. in addition,
the effect of procaine was reversible; recovery from the inhibition by procaine occurred quickly after removing procaine from the incubation solution. these results suggest
that the mode of action of procaine on dat is different
from that on na+ channels.
to resolve a serious problem of cocaine addiction, the
development of medicaments for the treatment of cocaine
addiction or prevention of its re-use is desired. one possible target of this is the dat molecule which is primarily
impacted by cocaine. to dissect da/cocaine-binding sites
on the dat molecule, we examined its molecular functional map by site-directed mutagenesis, and demonstrated
that although da and cocaine share common sites on dat,
they do not completely overlap their recognition sites
(kitayama et al. 1992). this predicts the possibility of de-

veloping medicaments that selectively prevent cocaine
from binding to dat without affecting normal da transport. based on this rationale, several compounds are being screened in the search for compounds that display dissociated inhibitory potency for da uptake and cft binding (kitayama et al. 1996). since some las revealed specific inhibition of dat, we examined the possibility of
dissociated inhibitory potency. however, the ic50 values
of the las described in table 1 have thus far revealed no
great difference between da uptake and cft binding inhibition. therefore, we conclude that the interaction of
synthetic las with dat is similar to that of cocaine, and
the possibility mentioned above remains to be clarified.
in summary, the present results demonstrated that certain synthetic las display a selective inhibition of monoamine neurotransmitter transporters. it is suggested that this
effect might contribute to the cocaine-like psychotomimetic
action of certain las.
