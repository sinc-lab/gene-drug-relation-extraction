abstract
pip3ea (2-[4-(2-methoxyphenyl) xxxd2960xxx -1-yl-methyl]imidazo[1,2-a]pyridine) and pd-168077 (n-[4-2-cyanophenylpiperazin-1-ylmethyl]-3-methylbenzamide maleate), two selective dopamine d4 agonists, administered systemically, intracerebroventricularly or
into the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus induce penile erection in male sprague–dawley rats. a u-inverted dose–
response curve was found with either compound when given subcutaneously (1–100 lg ⁄ kg) or intracerebroventricularly (0.1–
20 lg ⁄ rat), but not into the paraventricular nucleus (10–200 ng ⁄ rat). the pro-erectile effect of pip3ea and of pd-168077 occurs
concomitantly with an increased  xxxd2738xxx  (no) production in the paraventricular nucleus, as measured by the increased
concentration of nitrites and nitrates found in the dialysate obtained from the paraventricular nucleus by intracerebral microdialysis.
these effects of pip3ea and pd-168077 were reduced by l-745,870 (3-[4-(4-chlorophenyl) xxxd2960xxx -1-ylmethyl]-1h-pyrrolo[2,3b]pyridine trihydrochloride), a selective dopamine d4 receptors antagonist, by x-conotoxin, a blocker of voltage-dependent ca2+
channels of the n-type, by s-methyl- xxxd1641xxx , a neuronal  xxxd2738xxx  synthase inhibitor, and by d(ch2)5tyr(me)2-orn8-vasotocin,
an  xxxg1642xxx  antagonist, given into the lateral ventricles, but not into the paraventricular nucleus. comparison of the dose–
response curves of pip3ea and pd-168077 revealed that pip3ea is as potent as pd-168077 when given into the paraventricular
nucleus, but more potent when given systemically. however, both compounds are less efficacious (e.g. induce a lower number of
penile erection episodes) than apomorphine, a classical mixed dopamine receptor agonist, irrespective of the route of administration.
these results confirm previous findings showing that central d4 receptors mediate penile erection and show that dopamine d4
receptor agonists act in the paraventricular nucleus to facilitate penile erection by increasing central oxytocinergic neurotransmission.

introduction
penile erection is the result of a complex interaction between the
central and peripheral nervous system that induces muscle and
vascular changes at the level of the erectile tissues of the male
genital apparatus and that plays a key role in male copulatory
behaviour and reproduction of mammals, including humans (see
meisel & sachs, 1994; argiolas & melis, 1995; hull et al., 2002).
several brain areas involved in the central control of penile erection
have been identiﬁed. these include the medial preoptic area, the
hypothalamus and its nuclei, mainly the paraventricular nucleus
(pvn), the hippocampus, the medulla oblongata and the spinal cord
(see andersson, 2001; mckenna, 2000; melis & argiolas, 2003;
argiolas & melis, 2004, 2005). different neurotransmitters and
neuropeptides that inﬂuence penile erection have been identiﬁed in

these brain areas. among these, the best known are dopamine,
excitatory amino acids,  xxxd2738xxx  (no), oxytocin, acth-msh
peptides, which facilitate penile erection, and serotonin, gammaaminobutyric acid (gaba) and opioid peptides, which usually
inhibit this sexual response (see andersson, 2001; melis & argiolas,
2003; argiolas & melis, 2005). the facilitatory role of dopamine on
penile erection and male copulatory behaviour has been extensively
investigated since 1970, when the classical dichotomy dopamineserotonin, e.g. dopamine facilitates and serotonin inhibits sexual
behaviour, was born (see melis & argiolas, 1995). dopamine exerts
its facilitatory effect on penile erection and sexual behaviour by
acting mainly in the medial preoptic area and in the pvn, which are
innervated by incerto-hypothalamic dopaminergic neurons of the
a13 and a14 groups of dalsthrom and fuxe (see buijs et al., 1984;
lindvall et al., 1984; and references therein). such a role is
conﬁrmed by microinjection studies showing that dopamine agonists
and antagonists inﬂuence penile erection and sexual behaviour when
injected into these brain areas (hull et al., 1986; melis et al., 1987;

ª the authors (2006). journal compilation ª federation of european neuroscience societies and blackwell publishing ltd

2022 m. r. melis et al.
eaton et al., 1991; chen et al., 1999) and by intracerebral
microdialysis studies showing that dopamine concentration is
increased in the extracellular dialysate obtained from these brain
areas during sexual activity (melis & argiolas, 1995, 2003; hull
et al., 1995; melis et al., 1996, 2003; argiolas & melis, 2005).
interestingly, dopamine facilitates penile erection and sexual
behaviour by activating central oxytocinergic neurotransmission in
the pvn (melis & argiolas, 1995, 2003; argiolas & melis, 2004,
2005). a new site of action of dopamine has been recently localized
in the spinal cord (giuliano et al., 2002), while no signiﬁcant effect
has been found in the corpora cavernosa (see matsumoto et al.,
2005). all these studies led recently to clinical studies that
culminated with medical preparations of the mixed d1 ⁄ d2 dopamine receptor agonist apomorphine approved across the world for the
treatment of erectile dysfunction in man (see giuliano & allard,
2001; heaton, 2004; perimenis et al., 2004). the success of these
preparations was scarce, when compared to that of phosphodiesterase inhibitors, and it is likely that this is secondary to the
collateral effects of this drug in humans (nausea and vomiting),
which do not occur in rodents (see argiolas, 2005). the characterization of several dopamine receptors belonging to the d1 (d1
and d5) and d2 (d2, d3 and d4) families, each one with different
splice variants, has opened the search for molecules that act
selectively as agonists or antagonists of these dopamine receptor
subtypes, in order to deﬁne their exact role in human mental
pathologies, such as schizophrenia (see seeman & van tol, 1994;
sokoloff & schwartz, 1995; zhang et al., 2002). recently, a role for
d4 receptors in the control of penile erection was suggested by
studies showing that pd 168077 and cp 226269, two  xxxg658xxx 
agonists (kulagowski et al., 1996; heier et al., 1997; zorn et al.,
1997), induce penile erection when given systemically in male rats,
while pnu-95666e, a selective  xxxg656xxx  agonist (heier et al.,
1997) was found inactive (hsieh et al., 2004). these studies were
followed by the discovery of abt 724, another dopamine d4
receptor agonist, which was found to be able to induce penile
erection when given systemically and centrally in rats with a
potency similar to that of apomorphine (brioni et al., 2004).
interestingly, abt 724 was also found to be unable to induce
vomiting in the ferret, an animal model of nausea and vomiting in
contrast to the d2 agonist pnu-95666e (brioni et al., 2004; osinski
et al., 2005), providing a way to test compounds that induce penile
erection by acting selectively on dopamine receptors but devoid of
noxious side-effects, such as vomiting and nausea, which are
undoubtedly very disturbing, especially when occurring during
sexual intercourse in humans. other d4 agonists were soon
identiﬁed for their proerectile activity (see cowart et al., 2004;
moreland et al., 2005). interestingly, pd-168077 was also found
capable of inducing penile erection also when injected into the pvn,
one of the brain sites where dopamine acts to facilitate penile
erection by activating oxytocinergic neurotransmission (melis et al.,
2005) and to induce c-fos expression and extracellular regulated
kinase (erk) phosphorylation in this hypothalamic nucleus (bitner
et al., 2006). in order to provide further insights into the role of
dopamine d4 receptors in the control of penile erection at the level
of the pvn, the effects of pd-168077 and of pip3ea, another
recently characterized selective d4 agonist (enguehard-gueifﬁer
et al., 2006) (see table 1), on penile erection when given
systemically, centrally and into the pvn of male rats, and their
effect on paraventricular no synthase and oxytocinergic neurotransmission, were studied. a comparison of the pro-erectile effects of
these compounds with those of the classical mixed dopamine
receptor agonist apomorphine is also reported.

materials and methods
animals
male sprague–dawley rats (250–300 g; charles river, como, italy)
were used in all the experiments. the animals were caged in groups of
4–6 at 24 c, humidity 60%, lights on from 07:00 to 19:00 h with
water and standard laboratory food ad libitum. the experiments were
performed between 09:00 and 13:00 h. all experiments were carried
out in accordance with the guidelines of the european communities
directive of 24 november 1986 (86 ⁄ 609 ⁄ eec) and the italian
legislation (d.p.r. 116 ⁄ 92).

drugs and peptides
pip3ea (2-[4-(2-methoxyphenyl) xxxd2960xxx -1-yl-methyl]imidazo[1,2a]pyridine) was synthetized and puriﬁed as already described
(enguehard-gueifﬁer et al., 2006). pd-168077 (n-[4-2-cyan
ophenylpiperazin-1-ylmethyl]-3-methylbenzamide
maleate)
and
l-745,870
(3-[4-(4-chlorophenyl) xxxd2960xxx -1-ylmethyl]-1h-pyrrol
o[2,3-b]pyridine trihydrochloride) were purchased from tocris cook
son ltd (bristol, uk), x-conotoxin gvia, apomorphine hcl,
s-methyl- xxxd1641xxx  acetate (smtc), haloperidol, clozapine and
 xxxd1927xxx  from sigma (s. louis, mo, usa); d(ch2)5tyr
(me)2-orn8-vasotocin from bachem ag (ch). all other reagents
were from available commercial sources.

microinjections and microdialysis in the pvn
microinjections into the lateral ventricles (i.c.v.) were performed
through stainless-steel guide cannulas (22 gauge) aimed unilaterally
at the lateral ventricles stereotaxically implanted (stoelting co,
wood dale, il, usa) under chloral hydrate anaesthesia (400 mg/kg
i.p.) 3 days before the experiments (coordinates i.c.v., 1.0 anterior to
bregma, 1.0 lateral to midline, and 5.0 mm ventral to dura;
pellegrino & cushman, 1971). animals were given three days to

recover from surgery; each rat was used only once. when i.c.v.
microinjections were performed, the microinjection cannula was
connected by polyethylene tubing to a 10-ll hamilton syringe
driven by a stoelting microsyringe pump (stoelting co., wood dale,
il, usa). when microdialysis was performed, microinjections and
microdialysis were performed in the pvn of the same male rat by
using microdialysis probes (approximately 1 mm of free surface for
dialysis), glued with an epoxy resin to a microinjection cannula
made with fused capillary silica tubing ending adjacently to the
u-shaped dialysis membrane, prepared as previously described
(melis et al., 1996). the probes were implanted stereotaxically into
the pvn under chloral hydrate anaesthesia (400 mg/kg i.p.) 3 days
before the experiments (coordinates 0.2 mm anterior to bregma,
0.4 mm lateral to midline and 7.3 mm ventral to dura; pellegrino &
cushman, 1971); each rat was used only once. also in this
experimental condition, for microinjection into the pvn, the
microinjection cannula was connected by polyethylene tubing to a
10-ll hamilton syringe driven by a stoelting microsyringe pump.
the probe was perfused with ringer’s solution, containing 147 mm
nacl, 3 mm kcl and 1.2 mm cacl2, ph 6.5, at a constant ﬂow rate
of 2 ll ⁄ min by using a stoelting microsyringe pump. after a 2-h
equilibration period, dialysate was collected every 20 min in aliquots
of 40 ll in polyethylene tubes kept  xxxd1891xxx –15 c for the determination of no2– and no3– as described below. after the collection of
three dialysate aliquots, a d4 agonist (pip3ea or pd-168077) or
apomorphine-hcl was dissolved in appropriate vehicle (ringer’s
solution for apomorphine and ethanol for the d4 agonists, which
was diluted with water, ﬁnal ethanol concentration 0.3%), and
injected into the pvn in a volume of 0.3 ll. rats were observed for
80 min, during which four additional dialysate fractions of 40 ll
each were collected every 20 min and penile erection episodes were
counted. in experiments in which a dopamine antagonist, oxytocin
antagonist, x-conotoxin or smtc was used, these compounds were
dissolved in appropriate vehicles and microinjected into the pvn in
a volume of 0.3 ll over a period of 2 min, 15 min before the
dopamine agonists.

water; ﬁnal ethanol concentration 0.3%) was given subcutaneously
(s.c.) in a volume of 0.2 ml ⁄ kg body weight or intraperitoneally
(i.p.) in a volume of 1 ml ⁄ kg body weight, or i.c.v. in a volume of
10 ll ⁄ rat or into the pvn in a volume of 0.3 ll over a period of
2 min through the microinjection cannula connected by polyethylene
tubing to a stoelting 200 microsyringe pump. when microdialysis
was performed, the microdialysis probe was connected via polyethylene tubing to a 10 ll hamilton microsyringe driven by a
stoelting microsyringe pump on one end and to the polyethylene
collecting loop on the other hand. the cannula for pvn injections
was also connected to a 10 ll hamilton microsyringe driven by a
microinfusion pump via polyethylene tubing. after a 2-h equilibration period of perfusion of the dialysis probe with ringer’s solution,
a dopamine agonist was given in the pvn over a 2-min period.
when a dopamine antagonist, oxytocin antagonist, x-conotoxin or
smtc was used, these were given into the pvn 15 min before the
dopamine agonist. after treatments, rats were observed for the entire
duration of the experiment in order to count penile erection episodes
and, in those experiments during which microdialysis was performed, to replace ﬁlled loops with empty ones every 20 min. penile
erections were scored when the penis emerged from the penile
sheath, which was usually accompanied by penile grooming and hip
ﬂexions.

histology
at the end of the experiments the animals in which microinjections
i.c.v. or into the pvn with or without microdialysis probe were killed
by decapitation, the brains were immediately removed and stored in
2% aqueous formaldehyde for 12–15 days. to localize the position of
the probe tip, 50-lm transverse brain sections were prepared by means
of a freezing microtome, stained with neutral red and inspected on a
phase contrast microscope. the site of the probe tip was localized by
following the probe tract through a series of brain sections. only those
animals found to have the tip of i.c.v. cannula or of the dialysis probe
tip positioned correctly (see fig. 1) were considered for the statistical
evaluation of the results.

determination of no2– and no3– in the paraventricular dialysate
the concentration of no2– and no3– was measured in the
paraventricular dialysate by a modiﬁcation of the griess reaction,
as already described in detail (melis et al., 1996). brieﬂy, no2– in
the dialysate was used for the diazotation of sulfanilamide and
subsequent coupling to n-(1-naphtyl)ethylenediamine. the azo dye
was then quantiﬁed by high-pressure liquid chromatography
(hplc) from its absorbance at 546 nm. the sensitivity of the
assay was 0.1 lm and the response was found to be linear, with
increasing concentrations of no2– up to 25 lm. for the determination of no3– in the dialysate, no3– was previously reduced to
no2– with copper-cadmium, as already described (melis et al.,
1996). total no2– was then measured as described above and the
no3– content was calculated by subtracting that of no2– found in
the dialysate without copper-cadmium reduction. the sensitivity of
the method was 3 lm, and the response was linear with no3– up to
30 lm.

behavioural studies
rats were placed individually in plexiglas cages (30 · 30 · 30 cm).
after a 30-min habituation period, a dopamine agonist dissolved in
appropriate vehicle (ringer’s solution, or ethanol and diluted with

statistics
for the statistical evaluation of the results, the area under the curves
(auc) obtained by plotting penile erection, no2– and no3– values vs.
time in each animal was ﬁrst calculated with the classical trapezoidal
rule. the aucs were then statistically compared between groups with
the mann–whitney u-test in order to show signiﬁcant differences
between the groups that received a different pharmacological
treatment. a p < 0.025 was considered signiﬁcant. (statistica for
windows, 4.0, statsoft inc., tulsa, ok, usa).

results
effect of s.c. or i.c.v. pip3ea and pd-168077 on penile erection:
dose–response curve and comparison with apomorphine
pip3ea and pd-168077 (s.c. or i.c.v.) increase penile erection
episodes in male rats with an inverted u-shaped dose–response
curve (fig. 2a and 2b). when given s.c. the minimal effective dose
of pip3ea was 5 lg ⁄ kg, which increased this sexual response by
35% above control values (0.3 ± 0.1 penile erections ⁄ rat in 1 h;
p < 0.05), while that of pd-168077 was 50 lg ⁄ kg, which increased
penile erection by 30% above control values. the maximal response
was seen with 20 lg ⁄ kg of pip3ea and with 100 lg ⁄ kg of pd168077, which increased penile erection episodes by more than
100% above control values (p < 0.01). higher doses of pip3ea (30
and 100 lg) were much less effective than 20 lg in increasing
penile erection episodes with a marked tendency of the erectile
response towards basal values (fig. 2a). similar results were found
when pip3ea and pd-168077 were given i.c.v., being 0.5 lg the
minimal effective dose of pip3ea and 5 lg that of pd-168077,
which increased penile erection episodes 40% above basal values,
while the maximal effect was seen with the dose of 1 lg of pip3ea
and 10 lg of pd-168077. higher doses increased penile erection
much less than 1 lg and 10 lg and showed a marked tendency
towards basal values, as found when the drugs were given s.c.
(fig. 2b). as expected, similar inverted u-shaped dose–response
curves were found with apomorphine given s.c. or i.c.v. accordingly, the aucs of rats treated with different doses of pip3ea, pd168077 and apomorphine for penile erection were signiﬁcantly
higher than those of vehicle-treated rats (p < 0.001). comparison of
the dose–response curves of pip3ea, pd-168077 and apomorphine
given systemically or i.c.v. revealed that pip3ea is active at doses

similar to those of apomorphine; however, the number of penile
erection episodes induced by pip3ea is lower than that induced by
apomorphine (p < 0.01).

effect of different dopamine receptor antagonists given
systemically on pip3ea- and pd-168077-induced penile
erection: comparison with apomorphine
the pro-erectile effect of pip3ea (20 lg ⁄ kg s.c.) and of pd-168077
(100 lg ⁄ kg s.c.) was reduced by more than 80% by the prior injection
of l-745,870 (1 mg ⁄ kg), a selective  xxxg658xxx  antagonist, and of
haloperidol (0.5 mg ⁄ kg) and clozapine (1 mg ⁄ kg), which block all
dopamine receptor subtypes, all given i.p. 15–30 min before the
dopamine agonist (p < 0.001; fig. 3). in contrast, no reduction of the
pro-erectile effect of pip3ea and pd-168077 was found with
 xxxd1927xxx  (5 mg ⁄ kg i.p.), a dopamine receptor antagonist of the
dopamine receptors of the d2 subtype, which does not cross the blood
brain barrier, when given 15 min before the dopamine agonist
(p > 0.1, not signiﬁcant). accordingly, the aucs of all dopamine

paraventricular dopamine d4 receptors and penile erection 2025
receptor antagonists (except  xxxd1927xxx ) + pip3ea- and pd168077-treated rats for penile erection were signiﬁcantly lower than
those of pip3ea- and pd-168077-treated rats (p < 0.001). results
similar to those reported above were found with haloperidol and
clozapine when penile erection was induced by apomorphine
(80 lg ⁄ kg s.c.), but not with l-745,870, which reduced apomorphine-induced penile erection only by 25%. accordingly, the aucs of
l-745,870 + apomorphine-treated rats for penile erection were lower
than those of apomorphine-treated rats, but signiﬁcantly higher than
those of l-745,870 + pip3ea- or + pd-168077-treated rats
(p < 0.001).

effect of pip3ea and pd-168077 injected into the pvn on
penile erection and no production in the pvn: dose–response
curves and comparison with apomorphine
pip3ea and pd-168077 induce penile erection also when injected
into the pvn. the minimal effective dose was 50 ng, while the
maximal effect was seen with the dose of 200 ng (fig. 4). penile
erection induced by pip3ea and pd-168077 given into the pvn
occurred concomitantly to an increase in no2– and no3– concentrations in the paraventricular dialysate (fig. 4). the increase was already
observed 20 min after the pvn injection, lasted for 40 min and
disappeared after 60 min. as expected, similar results were obtained
with apomorphine (10–200 ng) which was active at doses as low as
10 ng (fig. 4). accordingly the aucs of rats treated with pip3ea,

pd-168077 and apomorphine for penile erection, no2– and no3–,
were signiﬁcantly higher than that of vehicle-treated rats (p < 0.001;
fig. 4). the comparison of the dose–response curves of pip3ea and
of pd-168077 given into the pvn with those of apomorphine,
revealed that pip3ea has a similar potency to that of pd-168077, but
lower than that of apomorphine (p < 0.01).

the increase of penile erection and of no2– concentration in the
paraventricular dialysate induced by pip3ea (100 ng) and pd168077 (100 ng) injected into the pvn were reduced almost
completely by the prior injection of the dopamine  xxxg658xxx 
antagonist l-745,870 (1 lg), a selective  xxxg658xxx  antagonist, given
into the pvn 15 min before the dopamine agonist (fig. 5a and b).
accordingly the aucs of rats treated with l-745,870 + pip3ea or
+ pd-168077 for penile erection were signiﬁcantly lower than those of
pip3ea- or pd-168077-treated rats (p < 0.001). as found after
systemic treatment, however, l-745,870 injected into the pvn was
much less effective on penile erection and the increase in no2– in the
paraventricular dialysate induced by apomorphine (50 ng), as it
reduced these responses only by 20–25% (fig. 5c). accordingly the
auc of rats treated with l-745,870 + apomorphine for penile erection
was lower than that of apomorphine-treated rats (p < 0.05), but higher

discussion
the present results show that pd-168077 and pip3ea, two selective
dopamine  xxxg658xxx  agonists (kulagowski et al., 1996; heier

et al., 1997; enguehard-gueifﬁer et al., 2006), induce penile erection
in male rats when given systemically, i.c.v. and into the pvn. the
effect is dose-dependent, and follows a u-inverted dose–response
curve after systemic and i.c.v. administration, but not after injection
into the pvn. the comparison of the dose–response curves of
pip3ea given systemically or i.c.v. with those of pd-168077 shows
that pip3ea is more potent than pd-168077, as it induces penile
erection at doses that are lower than those of pd-168077. however,
the efﬁcacy of the two compounds (e.g. the maximal number of
penile erections ⁄ rat in 60 min) seems to be the same, as at
appropriate doses pd-168077 induces a number of penile erection

episodes similar to that induced by the most efﬁcacious dose of
pip3ea.
despite the above differences, the two dopamine  xxxg658xxx 
agonists show similar dose–response curves when injected into the
pvn and no u-inverted dose–response curve is found. this suggests
that the differences between the two compounds when given s.c. or
i.c.v. may be secondary to interfering actions of the two compounds at
other sites, which are overcome by the direct injection into the pvn.
alternatively, it is also possible that doses of the two d4 agonists
higher than those used in this study may have produced a down-turn of
the dose–response curves even when injected into the pvn.
the present ﬁndings also show that the effect of pip3ea and of
pd-168077 given systemically on penile erection is reduced by
dopamine receptor antagonists such as haloperidol or clozapine, which
block all  xxxg656xxx  subtypes, and most importantly, by
l-745,870, a selective  xxxg658xxx  antagonist (patel et al., 1997). as
the effect of pip3ea or of pd-168077 given systemically is not
reduced by  xxxd1927xxx , a  xxxg656xxx  antagonist that does
not cross the blood brain barrier, the above results conﬁrm and extend
previous studies supporting a role of central dopamine d4 receptors in
the control of penile erection (brioni et al., 2004; cowart et al., 2004;
melis et al., 2005; moreland et al., 2005). moreover, as l-745,870
reduces penile erection induced by pip3ea and pd-168077 also when
injected into the pvn, the ﬁndings are in line with previous studies
showing that the pvn is one of the brain sites in which dopamine d4
receptor agonists act to facilitate erectile function and conﬁrm a role of
paraventricular dopamine d4 receptors in the control of penile
erection (melis et al., 2005). accordingly, the existence of functional
dopamine d4 receptors in the pvn mediating penile erection was
already suggested by the ability of pd-168077 to induce penile
erection when injected into the pvn (melis et al., 2005) and to
increase c-fos and extra-cellular signal regulated kinase (erk)
expression in the pvn (bitner et al., 2006), effects that are all
reduced by dopamine  xxxg658xxx  antagonists (melis et al., 2005;
bitner et al., 2006; and this study).
the results obtained with pip3ea and pd-168077 resemble those
found when penile erection is induced by apomorphine, a classical
mixed dopamine receptor agonist, and other mixed dopamine d2
agonists (see melis & argiolas, 1995; melis et al., 1996 and
references therein). interestingly, comparison of the dose–response
curves of pip3ea and pd-168077 shows that pip3ea given
systemically and i.c.v. seems as effective as apomorphine at low
doses, but the range of the u-inverted dose–response curve in which
the compound is able to induce penile erection is narrower than that of
apomorphine. most importantly, the efﬁcacy of pip3ea and of
pd-168077 (e.g. the maximal number of penile erections ⁄ rat seen in
60 min after the dopamine agonists), are lower than that of
apomorphine. the lower efﬁcacy of dopamine  xxxg658xxx  agonists
when compared to apomorphine is further conﬁrmed by the comparison of the dose–response curves of the three dopamine receptor
agonists injected into the pvn, when no u-inverted dose–response
curve is found. here, pip3ea and pd-168077 are active at doses that
are higher than those of apomorphine, and also in this case the number
of penile erection episodes ⁄ rat induced by pip3ea and pd-168077 is
lower than that of apomorphine. the reason for these differences
between apomorphine and  xxxg658xxx  agonists is unknown and only
some speculation is possible at present. one explanation may be the
higher afﬁnity for apomorphine on dopamine d4 receptors when
compared to pip3ea or pd-168077, as suggested by in vitro studies
showing that the ec50 of apomorphine (1.2 nm) is lower than that of
pd-168077 (5.5 nm) in increasing the gtpcs binding activity (hsieh
et al., 2004). this is a measure of the activation of g-protein coupled

receptors after receptor binding, which is used to study the activation
of dopamine d4 receptors (see hsieh et al., 2004 and references
therein). alternatively, pip3ea and pd-168077 may act as dopamine
d4-receptor partial agonists, as found in in vitro studies showing that
pip3ea has only 45–50% of the activity of the full agonist quinpirole
in stimulating the incorporation of [3h]thymidine or [35s]gtpcs
binding in cho cells expressing human d4.4 receptors (enguehardgueifﬁer et al., 2006). finally, the concomitant activation of different
dopamine receptor subtypes by apomorphine may produce higher
activation of the targets, which lead to erectile response, than
activation of one dopamine receptor subtype only. in this regard, it
is noteworthy that the selective blockade of paraventricular d4
receptors by doses of l-745,870 given systemically or into the pvn,
which almost completely reduces penile erection induced by pip3ea
or by pd-168077, exerts only a modest effect, if any, on apomorphineinduced penile erection. indeed, this ﬁnding suggests that the blockade
of paraventricular d4 receptors alone is not sufﬁcient to reduce the
erectile response by compounds such as apomorphine that stimulate
all dopamine receptor subtypes. this interpretation is complicated by
the weak agonist activity of l-745,870 found in in vitro studies in
different cell preparations (gazi et al., 1998, 1999). however, it is
unlikely that this weak agonist activity is interfering in our in in vivo
experiments, as the compound did not induce penile erection when
given alone, either systemically or into the pvn, at doses that almost
completely reduce penile erection induced by pd-168077 or pip3ea,
two selective  xxxg658xxx  agonists (melis et al., 2005 and this study).
as synergic and ⁄ or opposite interactions between different dopamine
receptors have been found in other experimental circumstances,
including erectile function and sexual behaviour (see hull et al.,
1989), further studies with dopamine receptor agonists and antagonists
with different activities not only on dopamine d4 receptors but also on
the other dopamine receptor subtypes are necessary to clarify the role
of these receptors in the control of penile erection at the pvn level.
despite the above differences between dopamine d4 agonists and
apomorphine, this study also shows that penile erection induced by
these compounds injected into the pvn occurs concomitantly with an
increase in no production, as measured by the increase in the
concentration of no2– and no3– in the paraventricular dialysate, as
already shown for apomorphine and other dopamine receptor agonists
of the d2 family (e.g. quinpirole; melis et al., 1996). as found for
penile erection, the increase in no production induced by pip3ea and
pd-168077 is lower than that induced by apomorphine; however,
perhaps most importantly, both penile erection and the increase in no
production induced by the two dopamine  xxxg658xxx  agonists, are
reduced not only by l-745,870, which blocks dopamine d4 receptors
selectively, but also by x-conotoxin gvia, a potent blocker of
voltage-dependent n-type ca2+ channels (mccleskey et al., 1987), by
smtc, that inhibits neuronal no synthase (furﬁne et al., 1994), when
given into the pvn, and by d(ch2)5tyr(me)2-orn8-vasotocin, a
potent  xxxg1642xxx  antagonist (bankowski et al., 1980), given
into the lateral ventricles, but not into the pvn. together, these
ﬁndings support the hypothesis that pip3ea and pd-168077 when
injected into the pvn, induce penile erection by activating oxytocinergic neurotransmission. accordingly, it is likely that dopamine d4
receptors mediating penile erection that are activated by dopamine d4
agonists, are localized in the cell bodies of oxytocinergic neurons as
suggested for dopamine d2 receptors. their stimulation by pip3ea or
pd-168077 causes an increase of ca2+ inﬂux into the cell bodies of
oxytocinergic neurons. this activates neuronal no synthase to
increase no production. no in turn excites oxytocinergic neurons
to release oxytocin in extra-hypothalamic brain areas and the spinal
cord leading to penile erection, as already shown for apomorphine and

paraventricular dopamine d4 receptors and penile erection 2029
other dopamine agonists (see melis et al., 1996; melis & argiolas,
2003; argiolas & melis, 2004, 2005). in line with this hypothesis,
apomorphine at doses that induce penile erection increases oxytocin
concentration not only in plasma of male rats and monkeys (melis
et al., 1989; cameron et al., 1992), but also in extra-hypothalamic
brain areas (melis et al., 1990). as to the ability of dopamine d4
receptor agonists to increase ca2+ inﬂux in the cell bodies of
oxytocinergic neurons mediating penile erection, it is noteworthy that
this is supported not only by the ability of x-conotoxin injected into
the pvn to reduce penile erection and the concomitant increase in no
production in the paraventricular dialysate induced by pip3ea and
pd-168077 (this study) and by apomorphine as well (argiolas et al.,
1990), but also by studies showing that dopamine d4 receptors are
g-protein coupled receptors whose stimulation increases ca2+ inﬂux
when expressed in several cell lines (brioni et al., 2004; cowart et al.,
2004; moreland et al., 2004).
the above explanation is based mainly on the hypothesis that
dopamine d4 receptors in the pvn are located exclusively in the cell
bodies of oxytocinergic neurons mediating penile erection. however,
other explanations cannot be ruled out. for instance, pip3ea or pd168077 might activate oxytocinergic neurons mediating penile
erection by modulating the activity of other neurotransmitters and ⁄ or
neuropeptides present in the pvn and already known to induce penile
erection by activating oxytocinergic neurons, such as oxytocin itself
and excitatory amino acids, or by inhibiting the activity of endogenous
opioids or of gaba, which reduce the activity of oxytocinergic
neurons and penile erection (see melis & argiolas, 2003; argiolas &
melis, 2005). although further experiments are necessary to verify the
above possibilities, at the moment it seems unlikely that penile
erection induced by pip3ea or pd-168077 injections into the pvn
are mediated by oxytocin released in the pvn, as pvn microinjections of d(ch2)5tyr(me)2-orn8-vasotocin, a potent  xxxg1642xxx 
antagonist, did not reduce d4 agonist-induced penile erection or the
increase in no production (melis et al., 2005 and this study).
in conclusion, the present study provides further evidence for a
facilitatory role of central dopamine d4 receptors in penile erection. in
particular the study shows that pip3ea and pd 168077, two
dopamine  xxxg658xxx  agonists induce penile erection when injected
into the pvn by increasing central oxytocinergic neurotransmission.
this effect is secondary to an increased no production in the pvn.
the available data suggest that the stimulation of dopamine d4
receptors in the pvn by the above compounds leads to an increased
ca2+ inﬂux into the cell bodies of oxytocinergic neurons mediating
penile erection. this activates neuronal no synthase to increase no
production in the pvn. no in turn activates oxytocinergic neurons
mediating penile erection, as shown for other agents that induce penile
erection when injected into the pvn (argiolas & melis, 2005).
although it remains to be clariﬁed why apomorphine is more
efﬁcacious than selective  xxxg658xxx  agonists in inducing penile
erection, and why the selective blockade of central and paraventricular
dopamine d4 receptors exerts only a modest effect on penile erection
induced by apomorphine, these ﬁndings are in line with studies
showing dopamine  xxxg658xxx  agonists are capable of inducing
penile erection when given systemically (brioni et al., 2004; cowart
et al., 2004; hsieh et al., 2004; moreland et al., 2005), and conﬁrm
that the pvn is one of the brain sites where dopamine  xxxg658xxx 
agonists act to facilitate penile erection (melis et al., 2005).
