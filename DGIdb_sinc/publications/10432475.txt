modulation of dialysate levels of dopamine,

alain gobert, ph.d. and mark j. millan, ph.d.

(-)- xxxd2957xxx , which possesses significant affinity for 5-ht1a,
5-ht1b, and b1/2-adrenergic receptors (ar)s, dosedependently increased extracellular levels of dopamine
(da) and noradrenaline (nad) versus 5-ht, in dialysates
of the frontal cortex (fcx), but not accumbens and
striatum, of freely-moving rats. in distinction, the
preferential b1-ar antagonist, betaxolol, and the
preferential b2-ar antagonist, ici118,551, did not increase
basal levels of da, nad, or 5-ht. further, they both dosedependently and markedly blunted the influence of
(-)- xxxd2957xxx  upon da and nad levels. the selective 5-ht1a
receptor antagonist, way100,635, slightly attenuated the
(-)- xxxd2957xxx -induced increase in da and nad levels, while
the selective 5-ht1b antagonist, sb224,289, was ineffective.
these data suggest that (-)- xxxd2957xxx  facilitates frontocortical
dopaminergic (and adrenergic) transmission primarily by
activation of b1/2-ars and, to a lesser degree, by stimulation
of 5-ht1a receptors, whereas 5-ht1b receptors are not

involved. (-)- xxxd2957xxx  potentiated the increase in fcx levels
of 5-ht elicited by the 5-ht reuptake inhibitors, fluoxetine
and duloxetine, and also enhanced their ability to elevate
fcx levels of da—though not of nad. in contrast to
(-)- xxxd2957xxx , betaxolol and ici118,551 did not affect the
actions of fluoxetine, whereas both way100,635 and
sb224,289 potentiated the increase in levels of 5-ht—but
not da or nad levels—elicited by fluoxetine. in
conclusion, (-)- xxxd2957xxx  modulates, both alone and together
with 5-ht reuptake inhibitors, dopaminergic, adrenergic,
and serotonergic transmission in the fcx via a complex
pattern of actions at b1/2-ars, 5-ht1a, and 5-ht1b
receptors. these findings have important implications for
clinical studies of the influence of (-)- xxxd2957xxx  upon the
actions of antidepressant agents.

there is considerable interest in strategies which may allow for a more rapid onset of therapeutic benefit (blier
and de montigny 1994; frazer 1997; lucki et al. 1994;
nemeroff 1997). in this regard, it has been hypothesized
that a desensitization of 5-ht1a autoreceptors (localized
on the dendrites of serotonergic neurones) underlies the
lack of an immediate response to ad administration.
according to this hypothesis (artigas et al. 1996; blier et
al. 1990), the delay to onset of action of ssris (and other
drugs inhibiting 5-ht uptake) may be explained by
their propensity to increase extracellular levels of 5-ht
not only postsynaptically, but also presynaptically at
inhibitory 5-ht1a autoreceptors localized on the dendrites of serotonergic cell bodies in raphe nuclei (davidson and stamford 1995; rutter et al. 1995). this simultaneous activation of 5-ht1a autoreceptors diminishes
the activity of serotonergic neurones, thereby braking
the postsynaptic increase in 5-ht levels.
the progressive desensitization of 5-ht1a autoreceptors is accompanied by a gradual reinforcement in serotonergic transmission and the development of therapeutic ad actions (artigas et al. 1996). correspondingly, the
acute blockade of 5-ht1a autoreceptors should mimic
processes of desensitization. indeed, selective  xxxg1108xxx  antagonists, such as way100,635, as well as the
 xxxg1108xxx  ligand, (-)- xxxd2957xxx , potentiate the influence of ssris upon postsynaptic levels of 5-ht in corticolimbic structures in rats (arborelius et al. 1996; artigas
et al. 1996; galloway 1996; gartside et al. 1995; gobert et
al. 1997b; hjorth 1996; hjorth et al. 1996). furthermore,
blockade of 5-ht1a autoreceptors potentiates certain behavioural actions of ssris (detke et al. 1996; jackson et
al. 1997; millan et al. 1998a; mitchell and redfern 1997;
trillat et al. 1998). this intriguing hypothesis provides,
thus, a rational, theoretical basis for clinical studies of the
co-administration of 5-ht1a autoreceptor antagonists
with ad agents. indeed, as concerns therapeutic ad actions, co-treatment with (-)- xxxd2957xxx  and ssris has been
reported as beneficial in several—though not all—clinical studies (berman et al. 1997; debattista et al. 1998;
mcaskill et al. 1998; nemeroff 1997).
there exist, however, conflicting experimental data
concerning the desensitization of 5-ht1a autoreceptors
upon their chronic stimulation by treatment with ssris or
direct agonists (artigas et al. 1996; hjorth and auerbach
1994; kreiss and lucki 1997; le poul et al. 1995). further-

more, several questions remain concerning the mechanism(s) underlying the apparent ability of (-)- xxxd2957xxx  to
enhance the actions of ad agents. first, possibly depending upon the level of extracellular 5-ht, (-)- xxxd2957xxx  has
been shown to exert mixed agonist and antagonist actions
at 5-ht1a autoreceptors (clifford et al. 1998; corradetti et
al. 1998; romero et al. 1996; lejeune and millan unpublished observations) (see discussion). second, serotonergic
neurones also bear inhibitory 5-ht1b receptors on their
terminals (and, possibly, cell bodies) which may also
adapt upon chronic treatment with ssris, and (-)- xxxd2957xxx  is also an antagonist at these sites in the rat (adham
et al. 1992; assie and koek 1996; bourin et al. 1998; hoyer
and schoeffter 1991; millan et al. in press). third, (-)- xxxd2957xxx  is a potent partial agonist at b-ars (frishman 1983;
hoffman and lefkowitz 1996), a role of which has been
implicated in depressive states (o’donnell et al. 1994;
thiessen et al. 1990; zohar et al. 1987). fourth, 5-ht1a,
5-ht1b and b-ars may all play modulatory roles in controlling the activity of dopaminergic and adrenergic projections to the fcx (gobert et al. 1998; kelland and
chiodo 1996; lejeune et al. 1998; millan et al. 1997; misu
and kubo 1986; murugaiah and o’donnell 1995), and a
perturbation in the activity of these pathways is implicated in the emotional and cognitive deficits of depressive states (caldecott-hazard et al. 1991; goodwin 1997;
leonard 1997; zacharko and anisman 1991).
these observations raise the question of a potential influence of (-)- xxxd2957xxx  upon depressive states via an interaction with dopaminergic and/or adrenergic mechanisms
in the fcx. thus, herein, we characterized the potential
influence of (-)- xxxd2957xxx , both alone and together with ssris, upon frontocortical dopaminergic, adrenergic, and serotonergic transmission. inasmuch as (-)- xxxd2957xxx  possesses significant affinity for b1/2-ar, 5-ht1a, and 5-ht1b
receptors (table 1) (vide-supra), we evaluated their respective roles by examining whether selective antagonists
at these sites either mimicked or blocked the effects of
(-)- xxxd2957xxx . a preliminary account of some of these findings has appeared in abstract form (lejeune et al. 1998).

and housed singly. laboratory temperature was 21 6
18c and humidity 60 6 5%. there was a 12h/12h light/
dark cycle (lights on  xxxd2274xxx :30 a.m.). all animal use procedures conformed to international european ethical standards (86/609-eec) and the french national committee (décret 87/848) for the care and use of laboratory
animals.
rats were implanted under pentobarbital anaesthesia (60 mg/kg, i.p.) with a guide cannula in the fcx or
in both the nucleus accumbens and the contralateral
striatum as described (gobert et al. 1998; millan et al.
1997). five days later, a concentric dialysis probe—4
mm length (fcx and striatum) and 2 mm length (accumbens), 0.24 mm, o.d.—was lowered into position
and perfused at 1 ml/min with a phosphate-buffered
solution of nacl, 147.2 mm; kcl, 4 mm; and  xxxg2125xxx  2, 2.3
mm (ph 7.3). two hours after implantation, samples
were taken every 20 min and three basal samples were
collected before one or two subcutaneous injections
separated by 20 min. serotonin, da and nad were simultaneously quantified by hplc/coulometric detection (esa 5014, coulochem ii; e1 5 290 mv and e2 5
1280 mv). monoamines were separated using a  xxxd3100xxx 
column (c18; 150 3 4.6 mm; particle size 5 mm) maintained at 348c and a mobile phase comprising 75 mm
nah2po4, 20 mm edta, 1 mm sodium decanesulfonate,
17.5% methanol, and 0.01% triethylamine (ph 5.70;
flow rate 2 ml/min). the sensitivity of the assay for
5-ht, da and nad was between 0.1 and 0.2 pg per
sample, respectively. all data are expressed as means
6s.e.m.s. monoamine levels were expressed as a function of mean basal pre-injection values (5 100 %).
anova with sampling time as the repeated within-subject factor was performed.

results
influence of (-)- xxxd2957xxx  upon resting levels of
5-ht, da, and nad in fcx as compared to
striatum and nucleus accumbens
administration of vehicle did not influence extracellular levels of da or 5-ht but elicited a mild and transient increase in dialysate levels of nad (see gobert et
al. 1998; millan et al. 1997) (figure 1). as shown in figure 1, (-)- xxxd2957xxx  elicited a sustained and marked increase in levels of both da and nad. this action was
expressed dose-dependently over a dose-range of 2.5–
20.0 mg/kg, s.c. in contrast to da and nad, (-)- xxxd2957xxx  did not elevate levels of 5-ht. indeed, as shown in
the figure 2, in certain experiments, there was a very
mild, but significant, decrease in levels of 5-ht. in analogy to (-)- xxxd2957xxx , racemic (6)- xxxd2957xxx  (10.0 mg/kg,
s.c.) similarly increased fcx levels of da and nad
(figure 1). in contrast to fcx, (-)- xxxd2957xxx  (20.0) exerted
little influence upon dialysate levels of da in the nucleus accumbens and striatum (figure 1).

influence of (-)- xxxd2957xxx  upon the actions of the
5-ht1a agonist, 8-oh-dpat, and of the 5-ht1b
agonist, gr46611
the selective 5-ht1a agonist, 8-oh-dpat (0.16), markedly suppressed dialysate levels of 5-ht, an action
which was prevented by (-)- xxxd2957xxx  (10.0) (figure 2).
the agonist 8-oh-dpat also provoked a marked increase
in fcx levels of da and, in the presence of (-)- xxxd2957xxx , this action was slightly attenuated. (indeed, there
was a tendency for levels of da to be even lower in the
(-)- xxxd2957xxx /8-oh-dpat group as compared to the vehicle/8-oh-dpat group, although this difference was
not statistically significant. possibly, this reflects an interaction between 5-ht1a and b-ar receptor-mediated
mechanisms controlling da release in fcx). in addition, 8-oh-dpat elicited a pronounced increase in
nad levels, which was not significantly modified by
(-)- xxxd2957xxx  (figure 2). the preferential 5-ht1b agonist,
gr46611 (10.0), diminished dialysate levels of 5-ht.
this action was blocked by (-)- xxxd2957xxx  (figure 2). further, gr46611 did not modify levels of da or nad.
the influence of gr46611 and (-)- xxxd2957xxx  in combination upon da and nad levels was equivalent to that of
(-)- xxxd2957xxx  alone (figure 2). the selective 5-ht1a antagonist, way100,635 (0.16), abolished the influence of
8-oh-dpat (0.16) upon fcx levels of 5-ht without affecting the influence of gr46611 (10.0) (gobert et al.
1998 and not shown). in an opposite fashion, the selective 5-ht1b antagonist, sb224,289 (2.5), abolished the

action of gr46611 (10.0) without affecting that of 8-ohdpat (0.16) (data not shown).

modify the action of (-)- xxxd2957xxx  (10.0), and likewise did
not affect basal levels of da or nad (figure 4).

influence of receptor-selective agents upon the
actions of (-)- xxxd2957xxx 

influence of (-)- xxxd2957xxx  upon the actions of
fluoxetine and duloxetine

in the presence of the preferential b1-ar antagonist, betaxolol, and the preferential b2-ar antagonist, ici118,551,
the influence of (-)- xxxd2957xxx  (10.0) upon levels of da
was dose-dependently and markedly blunted in each
case (figure 3). they also significantly, though to a
lesser degree, abrogated the influence of (-)- xxxd2957xxx 
upon nad levels (figure 3). these actions were maintained throughout the dialysis period. the selective
 xxxg1108xxx  antagonist, way100,635 (0.16), was inactive alone yet slightly and significantly diminished
the increase in dialysate levels of da and nad provoked
by (-)- xxxd2957xxx  (10.0) (figure 4). in contrast, the selective
 xxxg1109xxx  antagonist, sb224,289 (2.5), failed to

the doses of fluoxetine and duloxetine selected for
these studies, 5.0 and 10.0 mg/kg, s.c., respectively,
were based upon their ability to elicit increases in dialysate levels of 5-ht in fcx of a comparable magnitude
(figure 5), thereby facilitating comparisons of the modulation of their actions by (-)- xxxd2957xxx . in addition, fluoxetine and duloxetine each elicited a pronounced elevation in levels of da (figure 5). fluoxetine evoked an
increase in nad levels of a similar magnitude to 5-ht,
whereas the influence of duloxetine upon nad levels
was more accentuated—in line with its high affinity for
nad reuptake sites (engleman et al. 1995) (figure 5).
pretreatment with (-)- xxxd2957xxx  (10.0) enhanced the in-

figure 1. influence of (-)- xxxd2957xxx  upon dialysate levels of da, nad and 5-ht in the fcx as compared to striatum and
nucleus accumbens of freely-moving rats. data are means 6 s.e.m.s of 5-ht, da, and nad levels expressed as a percentage

discussion
sb224,289 (2.5) acted similarly in facilitating the increase in 5-ht levels elicited by fluoxetine without significantly modifying its influence upon levels of da or
nad (figure 7).

interaction of (-)- xxxd2957xxx  with 5-ht1a and
5-ht1b autoreceptors
(-)- xxxd2957xxx  has been shown to display agonist or antagonist properties at various populations of 5-ht1a recep-

278 a. gobert and m.j. millan

tors and, notably, it acts as a partial agonist at cloned,
human 5-ht1a receptors (see below). at these sites, its
efficacy is less than that of 5-ht and 8-oh-dpat, yet
greater than that of way100,635 (meltzer and maes
1996; newman-tancredi et al. 1998; wolff and leander
1997). this suggests that (-)- xxxd2957xxx  may enhance or
diminish activity at 5-ht1a sites dependent upon the
concentration of 5-ht available. this observation may,
thus, underlie the continuing discussion as to whether
(-)- xxxd2957xxx  behaves as an “antagonist” or “agonist” at
raphe-localized 5-ht1a autoreceptors in rats (artigas et
al. 1996; clifford et al. 1998; corradetti et al. 1998; fornal et al. 1998; romero et al. 1996; hjorth and sharp
1993). in our studies, we have observed that (-)- xxxd2957xxx 
behaves as a partial agonist in submaximally inhibiting
the firing rate of dorsal raphe nucleus neurones (lejeune and millan, unpublished observations). it might be
argued that such a partial agonist action of (-)- xxxd2957xxx 
at 5-ht1a autoreceptors is inconsistent with its minimal
suppressive influence upon fcx levels of 5-ht seen
herein and in other studies (assie and koek 1996;
hjorth and sharp 1993; sharp and hjorth 1990). however, 1) the firing rate of dorsal raphe nucleus neurones
is not invariably reflected in release at the terminal level
(davidson and stamford 1998); 2) there are regional differences in the effects of 5-ht1a autoreceptor stimulation upon postsynaptic levels of 5-ht (invernizzi et al.
1997; kreiss and lucki 1997; malagié et al. 1996;
romero and artigas 1997); and 3) antagonist actions at
5-ht1b terminals (see below) may mask its partial agonist actions at raphe-localized 5-ht1a receptors (assie
and koek 1996). in any case, the antagonist actions of
(-)- xxxd2957xxx  at 5-ht1a autoreceptors clearly prevailed in
its antagonism of the inhibitory influence of 8-ohdpat upon fcx levels of 5-ht seen herein and elsewhere (sharp and hjorth 1990) (figure 2). this finding
is analogous to that described for the selective and neutral 5-ht1a antagonist, way100,635 (gobert et al. 1998)
(see results).
(-)- xxxd2957xxx  also shows marked affinity for rat 5-ht1b
receptors and, at these sites, there is a consensus that
(-)- xxxd2957xxx  exerts antagonist properties (adham et al.
1992; assie and koek 1996; bourin et al. 1998; hoyer
and schoeffter 1991). indeed, in line with this notion,
in analogy to the selective 5-ht1b antagonist, sb224,289,
(-)- xxxd2957xxx  blocked the decrease in fcx levels elicited
by the 5-ht1b agonist, gr46611 (gobert et al. 1998;
millan et al. in press).

modulation by (-)- xxxd2957xxx  of dialysate levels of
da and nad in fcx: potential role of b-ars
in contrast to (-)- xxxd2957xxx , which dose-dependently increased fcx levels of da and nad, the preferential b1and b2-ar antagonists, betaxolol and ici118,551, respectively (conway et al. 1987; tsuchihashi et al. 1990),

neuropsychopharmacology 1999–vol. 21, no. 2

did not mimic this action. this difference suggests that
the partial agonist actions of (-)- xxxd2957xxx  at b1- and/or
b2-ars may be involved in its distinctive actions (frishman 1983; haeusler 1990; hoffman and lefkowitz 1996;
kaur and ahlenius 1997). several other lines of evidence may be evoked.
first, as concerns nad, the preferential b2-ar agonist, clenbuterol, (o’donnell 1997), elevates da and
nad levels in fcx (lejeune et al. 1998). second, b-ar
agonists enhance the release of nad from adrenergic
terminals in the cerebral cortex and hypothalamus in
vitro (misu and kubo 1986; murugaiah and o’donnell
1995). in these studies, b-ar antagonists blocked the actions of b-ar agonists but were inactive alone suggesting a lack of tonic control of nad release.
indeed, betaxolol and ici118,551 did not decrease
nad levels herein. third, b-ar agonists accelerate
nad turnover in the cerebral cortex and hypothalamus
(o’donnell 1993). fourth, herein, betaxolol and
ici118,551 both inhibited the influence of (-)- xxxd2957xxx 
upon fcx dialysate levels of da and nad (figure 3).
this provides an interesting analogy to the in vitro studies of murugaiah and o’donnell (1995), in which selective antagonists at both b1- and b2-ars inhibited stimulation of nad release by b-ar agonists in the cortex.
thus, both b1- and b2-ars might be involved in this action, in line with reports that they each are involved in
the ad effects of b-ar agonists (martin et al. 1986;
o’donnell 1997; o’donnell et al. 1994). in fact, in both
the present study and that of murugaiah and o’donnell
(1995), antagonists at b1- and b2-ars in each case inhibited the influence of (-)- xxxd2957xxx  upon da levels by
more than 50 %. the reason for this unclear. there may
exist some redundancy in their roles, or they may interact in the expression of their actions. alternatively, it is
possible that the b1- and b2-ar antagonists employed
are not absolutely selective: that is, they may also partially block b2- and b1-ar receptors, respectively.
although the concentration of b2-ars in the fcx is
modest (nicholas et al. 1993), they may be preferentially localized on the terminals of adrenergic neurones,
in analogy to the peripheral sympathetic system (misu
and kubo 1986). as concerns b1-ars, which are concentrated in the fcx, a subpopulation may, in analogy to
peripheral adrenergic nerves likewise be localized on
the terminals of adrenergic fibres therein (misu and
kubo 1986). nevertheless, the neuronal localization of
b1-and b2-ars modulating nad release is unclear, and
indirect actions are possible. for example, b-ars enhance frontocortical release of glutamate which may, subsequently, facilitate nad release via excitatory nmda
and/or ampa receptors (herrero and sánchez-prieto
1996; ikegaya et al. 1997; ruzicka and jhamandas 1993).
although, in an in vitro study, activation of b-ars facilitated the outflow of da in the striatum and hypothalamus, there is no information concerning such a

neuropsychopharmacology 1999–vol. 21, no. 2

possible influence of b-ars in the fcx (see misu and
kubo 1986). further, b-ar ligands do not modulate the
electrical activity of ventrotegmental area (vta)-localized, dopaminergic cell bodies (grenhoff et al. 1993)
(lejeune and millan, unpublished observations). however, the vta contains mrna encoding b1-ars which
may be transported to dopaminergic terminals in the
fcx. therein, both direct and/or indirect actions at b1and/or b2-ars may be implicated in the increase in extracellular da levels (nicholas et al. 1993).
(-)- xxxd2957xxx  shows low affinity and efficacy at rat
b3-ars, the presence of which in mature, rodent cns
remains unclear (summers et al. 1995). thus, a role of
b3-ars in the actions of (-)- xxxd2957xxx  is unlikely.

modulation by (-)- xxxd2957xxx  of dialysate levels of
da and nad in fcx: potential role of 5-ht1a and
5-ht1b receptors
it is well-established that  xxxg1108xxx  agonists enhance the activity of frontocortical dopaminergic pathways (gobert et al. 1998; lejeune et al. 1997, 1998;
millan et al. 1997) (figure 2). one possible underlying
mechanism (lejeune et al. 1997; lejeune and millan
1998) is a role of 5-ht1a autoreceptors, the activation of
which may disinhibit mesocortical dopaminergic pathways by removing a suppressive influence of 5-ht exerted via excitatory 5-ht2c receptors localized on
gabaergic interneurones in the vta (millan et al.
1998b; prisco et al. 1994). a similar mechanism may
intervene in the elevation of fcx levels of nad by
 xxxg1108xxx  agonists (done and sharp 1994; gobert
et al. 1998). alternatively, postsynaptic 5-ht1a receptors localized on dopaminergic and adrenergic neurones in the vta and locus coeruleus, respectively,
may be involved (done and sharp 1994; lejeune et al.
1997; lejeune and millan 1998). thus, the partial agonist actions of (-)- xxxd2957xxx  at 5-ht1a sites may contribute to its increase in fcx levels of da and nad and, in
line with this possibility, its action was partially attenuated by way100,635. inasmuch as (-)- xxxd2957xxx  little influenced 5-ht levels alone, the population of 5-ht1a receptors involved is likely to be postsynaptic and, in this
light, it is intriguing to note that (-)- xxxd2957xxx  may behave as an agonist or antagonist at 5-ht1a receptors in
various structures—an issue as yet to be addressed for
the vta and locus coeruleus (corradetti et al. 1998;
romero et al. 1996).
as discussed above, (-)- xxxd2957xxx  shows marked activity at 5-ht1b receptors, two populations of which
may potentially modify da and nad levels in fcx.
first, 5-ht1b receptors inhibitory to vta-localized
gabaergic interneurones (kelland and chiodo 1996);
and second, inhibitory 5-ht1b receptors on serotonergic
terminals themselves. however, (-)- xxxd2957xxx  is a pure
antagonist at 5-ht1b receptors (adham et al. 1992; assie

monoamines and depression 279

and koek 1996; hoyer and schoeffter 1991). furthermore, the selective 5-ht1b antagonist, sb224,289, did
not affect the increase in fcx levels of da or nad elicited by (-)- xxxd2957xxx . thus, stimulation of 5-ht1b receptors is unlikely to be involved in the increase in fcx
levels of da and nad elicited by (-)- xxxd2957xxx .

modulation by (-)- xxxd2957xxx  of the influence of ssris
upon fcx levels of 5-ht, da, and nad
in line with previous studies (see gobert et al. 1997b;
tanda et al. 1994), fluoxetine and duloxetine elevated
fcx levels of nad and da. while their relative influence upon nad levels may, at least partially, reflect
their actions at nad reuptake sites, respectively, their
enhancement in da levels possibly involves an action
of 5-ht at excitatory 5-ht3 receptors on dopaminergic
terminals (tanda et al. 1995).
the present study extends previous work (artigas et
al. 1996; gartside et al. 1995; hjorth 1996) in showing
that, in freely-moving rats, (-)- xxxd2957xxx  facilitates the elevation of 5-ht levels in the fcx elicited by fluoxetine
and duloxetine. in addition, (-)- xxxd2957xxx  enhanced (in
an apparently additive fashion) the influence of ssris
upon fcx levels of da, but not nad. thus, the nature
of the interaction of (-)- xxxd2957xxx  with fluoxetine and duloxetine was different for 5-ht and da versus nad in
the same dialysate samples, suggesting that pharmacokinetic factors are very unlikely to be involved in these
effect (see also artigas et al. 1996).

potentiation by (-)- xxxd2957xxx  of ssri-induced
increases in 5-ht levels: underlying mechanisms
first, a role of b-ars is unlikely since acute administration of b-ar agonists and antagonists does not modify,
either alone or upon co-administration with fluoxetine,
serotonergic transmission (figure 6) (bouthillier et al.
1991; hjorth et al. 1996; lejeune et al. 1998) (gobert a,
unpublished observations). furthermore, there is no
obvious neuroanatomical basis for a modulation of serotonergic transmission by b-ars (nicholas et al. 1993).
second, way100,635 mimicked the facilitatory influence
of (-)- xxxd2957xxx  upon the fluoxetine-evoked increase in
fcx levels of 5-ht (gartside et al. 1995; gobert et al.
1997b) suggesting that a reduction by (-)- xxxd2957xxx  of activity at 5-ht1a autoreceptors might be involved. it
might be argued that this would be incompatible with
intrinsic partial agonist actions of (-)- xxxd2957xxx  at 5-ht 1a
autoreceptors (clifford et al. 1998) (see above) since
5-ht1a agonists inhibit the influence of ssris upon fcx
levels of 5-ht (dawson and nguyen 1998; gobert et al.
1997a; hjorth 1996). however, as emphasized above,
(-)- xxxd2957xxx  possesses lower efficacy than 5-ht at 5-ht1a
receptors (newman-tancredi et al. 1998). it may, thus,
in analogy to its antagonist action versus 8-oh-dpat,

280 a. gobert and m.j. millan

reduce the activation of raphe-localized 5-ht1a autoreceptors by 5-ht following fluoxetine administration. a
third mechanism is offered by the antagonist actions of
(-)- xxxd2957xxx  at 5-ht1b autoreceptors localized on serotonergic terminals - and, possibly, cell bodies (bourin et
al. 1998; davidson and stamford 1995; hoyer and
schoeffter 1991) (figure 2). indeed, the 5-ht1b/1d antagonists, gr127,935 and sb224,289 (figure 7), markedly
facilitate the increase in fcx levels of 5-ht elicited by
ssris (davidson and stamford 1997; gaster et al. 1998;
gobert et al. 1997b; sharp et al. 1997).

influence of (-)- xxxd2957xxx  upon ssri-induced
increases in da and nad levels: underlying
mechanisms
as discussed above, different mechanisms underlie the
induction of fcx levels of da by ssris versus (-)- xxxd2957xxx  and a parsimonious interpretation of their apparently additive effects is that they represents the sum of
their individual actions. consistent with this possibility, the 5-ht1a autoreceptor agonists, buspirone and
8-oh-dpat, exert an apparently additive influence
with fluoxetine upon fcx levels of da (gobert et al.
1997a). the contrasting lack of additive effects of ssris
and (-)- xxxd2957xxx  upon nad levels was surprising. nevertheless, in analogy, buspirone and 8-oh-dpat similarly do not additively increase fcx levels of nad with
ssris (gobert et al., in press).

general discussion: relevance to
the treatment of depressive states
and the actions of ads
first, the present data are consistent with the hypothesis that, following ssri administration, (-)- xxxd2957xxx 
may attenuate stimulation of 5-ht1a autoreceptors by
5-ht and thereby increase postsynaptic 5-ht levels
(artigas et al. 1996). however, blockade of 5-ht1b receptors may also be involved in this effect in the rat
(hoyer and schoeffter 1991), a crucial point inasmuch
as (-)- xxxd2957xxx  has no affinity for homologous human
5-ht1b receptors (adham et al. 1992). second, upon administration alone, (-)- xxxd2957xxx  elevates extracellular
level of da and nad, but not 5-ht, in the fcx. furthermore, in the presence of (-)- xxxd2957xxx , the influence
of ssris upon fcx levels of da is more pronounced.
both frontocortical dopaminergic and adrenergic pathways control mood and cognition and a deficit in mesocortical dopaminergic transmission is implicated in depressive states (caldecott-hazard et al. 1991; zacharko
and anisman 1991). moreover, a potentiation of da
levels in the fcx may be a common denominator for
many ad agents (rivet et al. 1998; tanda et al. 1994).
the present findings add, then, a novel dimension to the

neuropsychopharmacology 1999–vol. 21, no. 2

interpretation of clinical observations of the adjunctive
treatment of depression with ad agents plus (-)- xxxd2957xxx : dopaminergic (and adrenergic) as well as serotonergic mechanisms may be involved (artigas et al. 1996;
berman et al. 1997; mcaskill et al. 1998). a further implication of the present data is that the effects of (-)- xxxd2957xxx  alone in depressed patients require evaluation.
third, the elevation by (-)- xxxd2957xxx  of fcx levels of da
and nad may involve its partial agonist actions at 5-ht1a
autoreceptors, but its partial agonist actions at b1/2-ars
are more strongly implicated. these findings are of relevance to experimental and clinical evidence that stimulation of b-ars is associated with ad properties, whereas
a commonly-reported side-effect of b-ar antagonists—
employed for the treatment of hypertension—is depression (o’donnell et al. 1994; thiessen et al. 1990; zohar et
al. 1987). furthermore, several classes of ad agent downregulate b-ars (principally b1) in the fcx and certain
other brain regions (duncan et al. 1994; hosoda and
duman 1993; okada and tokumitsu 1994). nevertheless, rigourous, controlled clinical studies of the influence of b-ar stimulation and blockade upon mood are
awaited. fourth, (-)- xxxd2957xxx  is not an ideal tool for an
evaluation of the 5-ht 1a autoreceptor antagonistdesensitization hypothesis inasmuch as it behaves as a
partial agonist at 5-ht1a autoreceptors and b-ars, as
well as an antagonist at (rat) 5-ht1b receptors. further,
via actions at these sites, it enhances fcx levels of da
and nad upon administration alone. on the other
hand, these actions of (-)- xxxd2957xxx  suggest, on empirical
grounds, that it may be a particularly useful adjunctive
agent for an improvement in ad effect. fifth, certain rodent-human differences should be mentioned. notably,
the above-mentioned absence of affinity of (-)- xxxd2957xxx 
for h5-ht1b receptors, yet its significant affinity for human versus rat b3-ars, which have been implicated in
depressive states (adham et al. 1992; liggett 1992; simiand et al. 1992).
several limitations of the present study should be
noted. the present results were obtained employing
single doses of (-)- xxxd2957xxx  in interaction with single
doses of fluoxetine and duloxetine. it would, thus, be
interesting to examine the actions of other doses of
(-)- xxxd2957xxx  and ssris. however, the performance of
complete dose-response curves for both interacting drugs
would be, in principle, necessary in order to permit the
formal demonstration of “additivity” or “synergy” of
drug effects via isobolographic analysis. such studies
would be difficult to perform and prohibitively timeconsuming for the dialysis approach adopted herein.
thus, the magnitude of the mutual facilitatory influence of (-)- xxxd2957xxx  and ssris upon da levels is difficult to precisely define. a further point to emphasize is
that the present studies were undertaken in the fcx.

lows for the simultaneous determination of 5-ht, da,
and nad levels (gobert et al. 1998), it would be of interest to extend the present work to other corticolimbic
structures, such as the hippocampus and septum, likewise implicated in the actions of ssris and other classes
of ad agent (maes and meltzer 1995).

conclusions
to summarize (see table 2), the influence of (-)- xxxd2957xxx 
upon monoaminergic transmission and depressive
states is not restricted to an enhancement in the influence of ssris upon postsynaptic 5-ht levels via the
blockade of 5-ht1a autoreceptors:  xxxg1109xxx 
blockade may also be involved in this action. moreover,
(-)- xxxd2957xxx  exerts an apparently additive, facilitatory
influence with ssris upon fcx levels of da. most intriguingly, the partial agonist actions of (-)- xxxd2957xxx  at
b1/2-ars and, though less markedly at 5-ht1a receptors, contribute to its intrinsic facilitatory influence
upon fcx levels of da and nad. these data raise the
possibility that (-)- xxxd2957xxx  itself may modify the emotional and cognitive deficits of depressive states. in conclusion, then, both alone and in interaction with ssris,
(-)- xxxd2957xxx  elicits a highly complex pattern of effects
upon dopaminergic, adrenergic, and serotonergic transmission via 5-ht1a, 5-ht1b receptors and b1/2-ars.
these findings may be of considerable significance to
our understanding of the influence of (-)- xxxd2957xxx  upon
depressive states and the actions of ad agents.
