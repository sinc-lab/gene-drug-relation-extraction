abstract
methylmalonic aciduria and homocystinuria, cblc type (mim 277400), is the most frequent inborn error of  xxxd1771xxx  (cobalamin,
cbl) metabolism, caused by an inability of the cell to convert cbl to both of its active forms (mecbl, adocbl). although considered a disease of infancy, some patients develop symptoms in childhood, adolescence, or adulthood. the gene responsible for cblc,  xxxg1416xxx ,
was recently identiwed. we studied phenotype–genotype correlations in 37 patients from published case-reports, representing most of the
landmark descriptions of this disease. 25/37 had early-onset disease, presenting in the wrst 6 months of life: 17/25 were found to be either
homozygous for the c.271dupa mutation (n d 9) or for the c.331c > t mutation (n d 3), or compound heterozygotes for these 2 mutations
(n d 5). 9/12 late-onset cases presented with acute neurological symptoms: 4/9 were homozygous for the c.394c > t mutation, 2/9 were
compound heterozygotes for the c.271dupa and c.394c > t mutations, and 3/9, for the c.271dupa mutation and a missense mutation.
several observations on ethnic origins were noted: the c.331c > t mutation is seen in cajun and french-canadian patients and the
c.394c > t mutation is common in the asiatic-indian/pakistani/middle eastern populations. the recognition of phenotype–genotype
correlations and the association of mutations with speciwc ethnicities will be useful for identiwcation of disease-causing mutations in cblc
patients, for carrier detection and prenatal diagnosis in families where mutations are known, and in setting up initial screening programs
in molecular diagnostic laboratories. further study into disease mechanism of speciwc mutations will help to understand phenotypic presentations and the overall pathogenesis in cblc patients.

introduction
in 1969, mccully proposed that hyperhomocysteinemia
plays a role in the pathogenesis of arteriosclerosis [1]. this
hypothesis was elaborated based on the pathological evidence of similar arterial damage seen in two patients with
diverent inborn errors of metabolism both presenting with
hyperhomocysteinemia: one “classic” homocystinuria, (cystathionine synthase dewciency, mim 236200), and a second
with a previously undescribed abnormality of cobalamin
metabolism resulting in homocystinuria, cystathioninuria,
and methylmalonic aciduria. the second patient was in fact

the very wrst cblc patient described in the literature [2,3].
cblc (mim 277400) is the most common inborn error of
cobalamin metabolism, with over 300 patients diagnosed.
 xxxd1771xxx  (cobalamin, cbl), in the form of the cofactors
methylcobalamin (mecbl) and adenosylcobalamin (adocbl), is required by the cytoplasmic enzyme  xxxg1479xxx  and by the mitochondrial enzyme methylmalonyl-coa
mutase, respectively. inherited disorders of intracellular
cobalamin metabolism are rare conditions, and have been
classiwed on the basis of somatic cell complementation as
belonging to eight diverent mutant groups ( xxxg1414xxx  to cblh) [4].
functional dewciencies of  xxxg1479xxx  lead to homocystinuria and elevated total plasma homocysteine ( xxxg1480xxx ,
 xxxg1479xxx , and cbld variant 1), while a primary defect in mutase or
in the synthesis of adocbl lead to methylmalonic aciduria
( xxxg1414xxx , cblb, cbld variant 2, and cblh). a dewciency of the

enzymes involved in the early steps of cellular  xxxd1771xxx 
metabolism lead to accumulation of both homocysteine and
methylmalonic acid in blood and urine (cblc, cbld, and
cblf). fig. 1 summarizes these conditions.
cblc was originally thought to be primarily a disease of
infancy, presenting with failure to thrive, acute neurological
deterioration, mental retardation, retinopathy, multisystem
organ dysfunction, and haematological abnormalities including megaloblastic anemia [4]. in 1984, shinnar and singer [5]
reported a previously asymptomatic 14-years-old girl diagnosed with cblc who presented with an acute onset of neurological symptoms, including dementia, myelopathy, and
motor neuron disease: this case-report was pivotal in establishing the heterogeneity of this condition. in 1997, rosenblatt
et al. [6] reviewed 50 cblc patients, of whom six patients had
late-onset. the authors concluded that the late-onset patients
had better survival and response to treatment, and less neurological sequelae compared to the early-onset patients. various
case-reports describing late-onset cases followed suite [7–14].
recently, we identiwed the gene responsible for this condition by homozygosity mapping and haplotype analysis
[15]. the gene was named  xxxg1416xxx  (for methylmalonic
aciduria cblc type with homocystinuria): it is comprised of
four coding exons and a 5th non-coding exon. molecular
modeling predicts that the c-terminal region of the gene

product folds similarly to tonb, a bacterial protein
involved in energy transduction for  xxxd1771xxx -uptake.
subjects and methods
subjects
for the past 22-years cultured wbroblasts from patients suspected of
having an inborn error of cbl metabolism have been sent to our laboratory for clinical diagnosis and characterization. a unique identiwcation
code was assigned to cell lines by the repository for mutant human cell
strains at the montreal children’s hospital (http://www.cellbank.mcgill.ca). referring physicians indicated whether cell lines should not be used
to pursue research into the origin of these diseases. the procedure was
approved by the royal victoria hospital research ethics board. thirtyseven patients in this collection have been the subjects of previous publications [16,5,7,17–27,8,28,9–11,29,12,30,31,13,32,14]. the diagnosis of cblc
was made based on cbl distribution studies as per the methods outlined in
rosenblatt et al. [33], as well as incorporation of label from [14c]propionate and 5-[14c]methyltetrahydrofolate into cellular macromolecules and
complementation studies as outlined by watkins et al. [34]. this paper
focuses on published case-reports of cblc patients, assigns causal mutations to many of the reported individuals and examines phenotypic correlations.

mutation analysis
the open-reading frame and xanking exon sequences of the  xxxg1416xxx 
gene, and the non-coding portion of exon 4 and exon 5, were sequenced

c.f. morel et al. / molecular genetics and metabolism 88 (2006) 315–321
from genomic dna. pcr products were puriwed with montage pcr96
wlter plates (millipore). sequencing reactions (10 l) contained 2 l puriwed
pcr product, 1 l bigdye terminator cycle sequencing version 3.1
(applied biosystems), 1.5 l of 5£ buver, 5 l h2o, and 0.5 l (1 m wnal) of
sense or antisense primer. products were analyzed on an abi 3730 £ 1 dna
analyzer (applied biosystems). sequencing wles were processed using
sequence analysis software (applied biosystems) and were assembled and
analyzed using the phred/phrap/consed system [35,36]. we have recently
reported 42 mutations identiwed in 204 patients [15].

results
mutation analysis
out of the thirty-seven published cases, nine were homozygous for the c.271dupa mutation (patients 6, 7, 11, 12, 14,
17, 18, 27, and 36); this particular mutation has been reported
to account for 40% of mutant alleles [15]. patients 2, 3, 9, and

317

37 were homozygous for the c.394c > t (p.r132x) mutation.
patients 15, 16, and 20 were homozygous for the c.331c > t
(p.r111x) mutation. two patients (32 and 33) were homozygous for the c.440g > a (p.g147d) mutation. three patients,
1, 4, and 19, were heterozygous for the c.271dupa and
c.394c > t (p.r132x) mutations. five patients, (5, 8, 21, 22,
and 23), were heterozygous for c.271dupa and c.331c > t
(p.r111x). three patients were heterozygous for c.271dupa
and c.82-9_12deltttc (patients 26, 34, and 35). table 1
summarizes the mutations identiwed in the thirty-seven
patients included in this study.

patients were found to be either homozygous for the
c.271dupa mutation (n d 9) or for the c.331c > t mutation
(n d 3), or compound heterozygotes for these two mutations (n d 5). most of the remaining early-onset patients
were either compound heterozygotes for diverent nonsense
mutations, or for a nonsense mutation and a frameshift
mutation (see table 2 for details on types of mutation).
nine of twelve (9/12) late-onset cases presented with
acute neurological symptoms: 4/9 were homozygous for the
c.394c > t mutation. these individuals (patients 2, 3, 9, and
37) had clinical courses characterized by normal development and health until early adolescence or adulthood with
sudden neurological deterioration (except for the asymptomatic 12-year-old girl identiwed once the diagnosis was
established in her older sister). 2/9 patients with late-onset
disease were compound heterozygotes for the c.271dupa
and c.394c > t mutations. interestingly, patient 1, who also
was a compound heterozygote for the c.271dupa and
c.394c > t, had early-onset disease. 3/9 patients with lateonset disease were compound heterozygotes for the
c.271dupa mutation and a missense mutation. the remaining 3/12 patients with late-onset disease had mainly renal
involvement in absence of neurological manifestations: all
were heterozygous for the c.271dupa mutation and the
c.82-9_12deltttc mutation. this intronic mutation was
not seen in any other individual from the database of 204
sequenced patients.
observations on ethnic background
out of the nine published cases homozygous for the
c.271dupa mutation, 6 patients are white (of european or
north american extraction), one is hispanic, one iranian,
and one middle eastern. from the database, another 44
patients from all ethnic backgrounds were found to be
homozygous for the c.271dupa mutation. therefore, this
mutation was seen in individuals of various backgrounds.
homozygosity for the c.331c > t (p.r111x) mutation in
the published cases was seen exclusively in three cajun
patients (patients 15, 16, and 20). in addition, three unpub-

lished patients of french-canadian background from the
database were also found to be homozygous for this mutation. compound heterozygosity for the c.331c > t and
c.271dupa mutations was identiwed in 5 published patients:
one said to be white from the usa (patient 8), one frenchcanadian (patient 5), and three from la, usa (patients 21,
22, and 23). from the database’s unpublished patients, an
additional wve individuals of french-canadian or cajun
background were found to be heterozygous for the
c.271dupa and c.331c > t mutations.
the c.394c > t (p.r132x) mutation, primarily associated with late-onset disease, was noted in homozygous state
amongst four published individuals of asiatic-indian, pakistani, or middle eastern descent (patients 2, 3, 9, and 37).
homozygosity for the c.394c > t mutation was seen in an
additional nine unpublished patients from the database, all
of whom were either asiatic-indian, pakistani, or middle
eastern. this mutation is seen in heterozygous state along
with c.271dupa in two individuals of european ancestry
(patients 4 and 19) and one patient of undisclosed ethnic
background. in the database, no individual of european
ancestry was homozygous for the c.394c > t mutation.
homozygosity for the c.440g > a (p.g147d) mutation
was noted only amongst native american avected individuals (patients 32 and 33, and a third non-published case
from the original data published by lerner-ellis et al.).
discussion
cblc has been demonstrated to be a heterogeneous condition. presentation can occur in the neonatal period with
multisystemic organ failure in the context of an acute metabolic crisis, by insidious developmental delay without metabolic illness, as a neurological deterioration in a previously
well child, adolescence or adult, or as isolated renal disease.
with the identiwcation of the  xxxg1416xxx  gene, it has
become possible to establish genotype–phenotype correlations, as well as observe ethnic-related trends. while the
function of the protein remains to be elucidated, the pathological genetic defect speciwc to each patient can in part
explain the heterogeneity that has come to light since mudd
and levy’s original case report [2,3].
diverences in rna stability or residual function of the
protein product are predicted to cause, at least in part,
diverences in phenotypes [37]. in addition, other factors
such as background individual genetic variation, environmental, and dietary exposures may also account for the variation in presentation in individuals carrying the exact same
two mutations. guigonis et al. [13] reported 2 sisters
avected with cblc who presented with thrombotic microangiopathy, suggesting haemolytic uremic syndrome, in
absence of neurological involvement. the younger of the
two sisters had more severe renal disease, associated with
renal failure: she was found to be heterozygous for the
3254t > c factor h polymorphism, which was felt by the
authors to explain her more aggressive renal involvement.
in addition, the patient reported by augoustides-savvo-

c.f. morel et al. / molecular genetics and metabolism 88 (2006) 315–321

poulou et al. [8], who was found to be heterozygous for
c.271dupa and c.394c > t, had onset of the disease after
being previously developmentally and neurologically normal: her older sister was reported to have had onset of seizures in the neonatal period, developmental delay, spastic
paraparesis, and died at 13 years of age, undiagnosed. it is
probable that this child was also avected with cblc and that
heterozygosity for c.271dupa and c.394c > t in this family
would have led to an early-onset case and a late-onset case,
demonstrating signiwcant intrafamilial phenotypic heterogeneity in the presence of identical mutations. another possibility, albeit less likely, is that one of the parents of these
girls is a compound heterozygote for both an early-onset
mutation and the c.394c > t, and the other parent a carrier
of the c.271dupa mutation. however, the parent with compound heterozygosity would be expected to be symptomatic: genotyping of the parents would aid in clarifying if this
is a case of familial phenotypic heterogeneity or of familial
genotypic heterogeneity. familial genotypic heterogeneity
has been reported in the case of pku and mild benign
hyperphenylalaninemia in the same family [38,39] and
could theoretically explain familial variability of phenotype
in other metabolic conditions. some additional factors that
help to explain intrafamilial variability may include “synergistic heterozygosity” for disease-associated alleles encoding other enzymes or proteins in the cobalamin pathway,
cis polymorphisms avecting folding or residual activity
of the mutated enzyme, trans acting factors’ interactions
with the mutated allele, and non-genetic factors such as diet
[40–43].
the mutation c.271dupa accounts for 40% of mutant
alleles in our collection of 204 unrelated patients [15]. upon
reviewing the phenotype of patients homozygous for this
mutation, the nine published cases were found to invariably
have an early-onset (usually within the wrst 4 months of
life), usually with an acute metabolic decompensation. multisystem organ involvement at the time of diagnosis was not
unusual, and most had a progression of their disease
despite institution of ohcbl intramuscular (im) injections.
a signiwcant proportion died, and of those who survived
the initial presentation, none were cognitively and developmentally normal.
lerner-ellis et al. noted that patients who are homozygous for the c.394c > t (p.r132x) generally present later in
life. the four published individuals with this genotype,
including the wrst late-onset patients reported by shinnar
and singer, demonstrate this wnding. patient three was
asymptomatic at the time of diagnosis, whereas the three
other individuals were cognitively and developmentally
normal prior to the development of psychiatric and neurological symptoms. in addition, all three symptomatic individuals were responsive to ohcbl im injections, with
complete (or near complete) reversal of the psychiatric and
neurological manifestations.
two patients of the 12 published cases with late-onset
disease were found to be compound heterozygous for the
c.271dupa (early-onset) and c.394c > t (late-onset) muta-

319

tions. these individuals did not present with acute metabolic decompensation early in life: both presented earlier
than the four patients homozygous for the c.394c > t
mutation, and later than the nine patients homozygous for
the c.271dupa mutation. after a period of normal development, both individuals manifested acute psychiatric and
neurological symptoms. ohcbl therapy reversed most of
their symptoms. therefore, it appears that these compound
heterozygotes can manifest a disease intermediate between
the severe early-onset form associated with homozygosity
for c.271dupa and the late-onset phenotype associated
with homozygosity for c.394c > t. however, patient one,
who was also found to be compound heterozygote for these
two mutations (as was the older sibling of patient 19, who
presented in infancy), presented with a clinical course indistinguishable for the patients homozygous for the
c.271dupa mutation, indicating that interpretation of
anticipated phenotype based on this genotype may be unreliable.
the presence of c.331c > t in individuals of frenchcanadian and cajun ancestry may rexect a case of founder
evect and genetic drift. the appearance of this mutation in
cajun individuals may be explained by the deportation of
the acadians by the british in 1755, where many headed
south to settle in louisiana.
diverent mutations at the same nucleotide are noted to
produce strikingly diverent phenotypes, based on the predicted amino acid change. an example of this is demonstrated by the c.440g > a and c.440g > c mutations. the
former is expected to cause a glycine to  xxxd233xxx 
change at codon 147, while the latter is expected to be associated with a glycine to alanine change at the same codon.
the c.440g > c (p.g147a) mutation was seen in compound
heterozygous state with the c.271dupa mutation, in a
patient (patient 24) who presented at the age of 45 years
after a normal earlier life, with an unremarkable past medical history. in contrast, the c.440g > a (p.g147d) mutation, in compound heterozygous state with the c.271dupa,
was associated with an early onset (all in the wrst month of
life), and severe systemic involvement in two unpublished
patients from the database of 204 sequenced patients.
codon 147 is located in the middle of the putative cbl
binding domain of the protein. therefore, the substitution
glycine by  xxxd233xxx  (a bulky, charged amino acid), may
greatly disrupt the catalytic ability or conformational state
of the protein, resulting in severe early-onset disease. conversely, replacing glycine for the second smallest, non-polar
amino acid alanine theoretically results in a lesser disruption of the protein’s integrity and leads to a milder disease
manifestation.
late-onset of disease was seen frequently in patients
who are compound heterozygotes for the c.271dupa mutation and a missense mutation: two examples of this from
the published cases are those of patient 24 (c.271dupa/
c.440g > c, diagnosed at 45 years) and patient 25
(c.271dupa/c.482g > a, diagnosed at 20 years). in fact,
adolescent and adult-onset cases were mostly seen in the

c.f. morel et al. / molecular genetics and metabolism 88 (2006) 315–321

c.394c > t homozygotes (as discussed above) and in compound heterozygotes for the c.271dupa and a missense
mutation.
the c.82-9_12deltttc mutation (in heterozygous state
with the c.271dupa mutation) was only seen in three
patients (patients 26, 34, and 35) with the unique presentation of haemolytic uremic syndrome without neurological
involvement. patient 26’s younger sibling was also similarly
avected. the c.82-9_12deltttc mutation is a presumed
splice site defect. it is possible that this mutation abolishes a
particular splice site necessary to generate an  xxxg1416xxx 
isoform essential for maintenance of renal integrity. ohcbl
injections greatly improved renal function in all 4 patients.
the recognition of apparent phenotype–genotype correlations and the association of mutations with speciwc ethnicities or populations of origin will be immediately useful
for identiwcation of disease-causing mutations in cblc
patients, for carrier detection in families where mutations
are known, and in setting up initial screening programs in
molecular diagnostic labs. there are potential implications
for newborn screening: mutation screening tests for the
more common early-onset mutations (i.e., c.271dupa and
c.331c > t) could be overed in those infants with a positive
screen for methylmalonic acid, thus consisting of a secondtier level in identifying cblc pre-symptomatically or early in
the course of the disease. molecular prenatal diagnosis
could also be overed to couples at high risk of having
avected children.
these wndings demonstrate the translation of genomics
into the application of a diagnostic tool. further study into
disease mechanism of speciwc mutations will help to understand phenotypic presentations and the overall pathogenesis in cblc patients.
