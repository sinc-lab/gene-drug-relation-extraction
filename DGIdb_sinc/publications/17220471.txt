 xxxd3083xxx  is a selective inhibitor of the late sodium current relative to peak sodium channel current, and via this
mechanism, it may decrease sodium-dependent intracellular calcium overload during ischemia and reperfusion.
 xxxd3083xxx  reduces the frequency of angina attacks, but
there is little information on its effects on myocardial
stunning after short-term ischemia. the objective of
this study was to test the effects of  xxxd3083xxx  on left
ventricular (lv) function and myocardial stunning after
ischemia/reperfusion in rabbits. myocardial stunning was
induced in rabbits by 15 minutes of coronary artery occlusion (cao) followed by 3 hours reperfusion. ten minutes
before cao, rabbits were randomly assigned to vehicle
(n = 15) or  xxxd3083xxx  (2 mg/kg bolus plus 60 µg/kg/min
infusion, iv, n = 15). myocardial stunning was assessed by
lv 2-dimensional echocardiography using, as a marker of
severity, ischemic free-wall fractional thickening (fwft;
systolic wall thickness – diastolic wall thickness/diastolic
wall thickness). regional ejection fraction (ef) was also
assessed. during cao, fwft was depressed in both
groups, indicating an ischemic insult (fwft was reduced
from 0.62 ± 0.05 at baseline to 0.10 ± 0.04 in vehicle and

from 0.73 ± 0.05 to 0.26 ± 0.07 in  xxxd3083xxx , p < 0.05,
 xxxd3083xxx  vs vehicle). after reperfusion, previously
ischemic myocardium remained stunned; however,
fwft recovered significantly better in  xxxd3083xxx  (0.51
± 0.05) than in vehicle (0.35 ± 0.04, p = .027). baseline
ef was 0.65 ± 0.02 in the  xxxd3083xxx  and 0.68 ± 0.02
in vehicle (p = ns). during cao, ef was reduced by
36% ± 6% in vehicle versus only 20% ± 6% in  xxxd3083xxx 
(p < .05). at the end of reperfusion, ef remained
depressed in both groups, but the reduction in the vehicle group (25% ± 5%) was significantly worse than in
 xxxd3083xxx  (9% ± 4%, p = .017). improvement in function was independent of necrosis (negligible) or differences in hemodynamics (no differences between
groups).  xxxd3083xxx  treatment reduced myocardial
stunning following brief ischemia/reperfusion suggesting that inhibiting the late sodium channel current may
be a novel approach to treating stunning independent
of effects on hemodynamics.

ischemia of less than 20 minutes duration, in spite
of normal perfusion and absence of cell necrosis.”1
although first described in several experimental animal
models of ischemia/reperfusion,2-5 it has clinical relevance in that it can occur after percutaneous coronary
angioplasty6,7 thrombolysis,8 and revascularization.9
several hypotheses have been proposed to explain
the cause of myocardial stunning (see the review by
bolli and marban10). one hypothesis is that oxygen
free radicals released at the time of reperfusion contribute to functional reperfusion injury. a second
hypothesis is that calcium plays a major role. it is
thought that protons released during ischemia leave

yocardial stunning reflects a type of functional
damage that can occur after a brief ischemic
episode followed by reperfusion. it has been
defined as “severely depressed regional myocardial
function, occurring subsequent to a short episode of

cells via the na+/h+ exchanger, resulting in an elevation of sodium in the myocyte. it is known that sodium
overload can lead to postischemic dysfunction and
that the amount of sodium overload is a determinant
of function after reperfusion.11
the resulting elevation of sodium causes calcium
overload in the cells via the na+-ca++ exchanger, resulting in an increased calcium influx during reperfusion.
in ischemia/reperfusion, both the na+-h+ and the noninactivating na+ channels (ie, late ina) are likely to contribute to increased intracellular sodium followed by a
subsequent calcium overload.12 increased cytosolic calcium concentration can lead to functional abnormalities and cell injury. calcium overload is thought to
contribute to stunning by decreasing sensitivity of the
myofilaments to additional calcium13 or by causing
transient structural damage to troponin or other proteins14 during the reperfusion phase.
 xxxd3083xxx  is a selective blocker of the late
sodium channel current relative to peak sodium
channel current.15-17 through its effect as a selective
inhibitor of the late sodium channel current,
 xxxd3083xxx  might prevent or reduce the harmful
effects of sodium accumulation in the cell and the
subsequent deleterious sodium-dependent calcium
overload that can accompany ischemia/reperfusion.
therefore,  xxxd3083xxx  might be beneficial in the setting of myocardial stunning.
 xxxd3083xxx  is a clinically used antianginal agent
and has been shown experimentally to reduce ischemic
damage in animal models such as primates,18 dogs,19
and isolated rabbit hearts.20 we have shown previously
that  xxxd3083xxx  reduces anatomic infarct size and
improves left ventricular function in a rabbit model of
60 minutes of coronary artery occlusion followed by
reperfusion.21 however, the effects of  xxxd3083xxx  on
myocardial stunning in the absence of necrosis are
unknown. therefore, the purpose of this study was to
test the effect of  xxxd3083xxx  on myocardial dysfunction
after brief ischemia (15 minutes) and reperfusion, as
might occur in patients experiencing vasospastic
angina (stunning).

methods
the rabbits used in this study were maintained in accordance with the policies and guidelines of the position of
the american heart association on research animal
use22 and the national research council’s guide for
care and use of laboratory animals.23 the association
for assessment and accreditation of laboratory animal

care international accredits good samaritan hospital.
the protocol was approved by the institutional animal
care and use committee of good samaritan hospital.

surgical preparation
male new zealand white rabbits (2-3 kg) were anesthetized with an intramuscular injection of a mixture
of ketamine (approximately 75 mg/kg) and xylazine
(5 mg/kg). throughout the study, pentobarbital anesthesia was given (∼50 mg/h) intravenously as required
to maintain a deep level of anesthesia as indicated
by lack of pedal or corneal reflex. the rabbits were
intubated and mechanically ventilated with oxygenenriched air. fluid-filled catheters were inserted into
the left jugular vein to administer fluids and drug
treatment, into the left carotid artery to measure systemic pressure, and into the left ventricle via the right
carotid artery to measure pressures. the chest was
opened through the left fourth intercostal space. the
pericardium was incised and the heart exposed. the
heart was placed in a pericardial cradle to facilitate
echocardiography. near the base of the heart, the first
large antero-lateral branch of the circumflex artery, or
the circumflex artery itself, was encircled with a 4-o
silk suture. the ends of the suture were threaded
through a piece of tubing, forming a snare that was
tightened to occlude the artery. body temperature was
maintained with a heating pad.

experimental protocol
after surgical preparation and a 15-minute stabilization period, baseline hemodynamic parameters were
obtained. the rabbits were randomized to receive
 xxxd3083xxx  (2 mg/kg bolus, injected over 60 seconds,
plus 60 µg/kg/min) or an equivalent amount of vehicle. (the investigator was blinded to treatment until
the completion of the entire study.) treatment was
initiated 10 minutes before coronary artery occlusion
(cao) and continued throughout reperfusion. ten
minutes after the start of treatment, hemodynamic
variables were recorded, and the coronary artery was
occluded by tightening the snare. the rabbits were
then subjected to 15 minutes of cao followed by 3
hours of reperfusion. hemodynamic parameters were
monitored and recorded at baseline, before cao, at
15 minutes of occlusion, and at 30, 60, 90, 120, and
165 minutes of reperfusion.
at the end of the reperfusion period, the coronary artery was reoccluded, and the ischemic region

was delineated with 4 ml of a 50% solution of
unisperse blue dye (ciba-geigy, hawthorne, ny)
injected into the left atrium. the deeply anesthetized rabbit was killed by an injection of kcl (12
meq) into the left atrium, and the heart was excised.

hemodynamic measurements
heart rate, mean arterial pressure, left ventricular
(lv) systolic pressure, lv end-diastolic pressure,
and maximum positive and negative first derivative
of lv pressure (dp/dtmax and dp/dtmin) were measured using fluid-filled catheters inserted into the
carotid artery and into the left ventricle. data were
digitized and recorded at a sampling rate of 1000/s
using an adi (advanced digital instruments, grand
junction, colo) system. three consecutive cycles
were averaged.

assessment of regional lv function by
2-dimensional echocardiography
a stand-off pad containing acoustic gel was placed on
the surface of the heart. two-dimensional short axis
echocardiograms of the lv (at the mid-papillary level
on a plane through the free wall at the top of the screen
and the normal septum at the bottom) were obtained
using a 7.5-mhz transducer (sonos 1000 ultrasound
system; hewlett packard, palo alto, calif) and were
recorded on videotape. absolute wall thicknesses and
areas were quantified using the sonos 1000 software.
echocardiograms were obtained at baseline,  xxxd1891xxx  minutes of ischemia, and at the end of 3 hours of reperfusion. measurements included free wall (stunned area)
and septum (normally perfused area) fractional wall
thickening, end-diastolic and end-systolic lv cavity
areas, and ejection fraction. fractional thickening was
computed as [(wall thickness in systole – wall thickness
in diastole)/wall thickness in diastole]. ejection fraction was computed as [(end-diastolic volume – end-systolic volume)/end-diastolic volume]. measurements of 3
cycles were averaged at each time point.

and rephotographed. the areas of ischemic risk (no
blue dye) and normally perfused regions (stained
blue) and the areas of necrotic (yellowish white) and
nonnecrotic regions (stained bright red) in each slice
were quantitated by digitized planimetry. the areas in
each slice were multiplied by the weight of that slice,
and the results were summed to obtain the weights of
the risk and infarcted areas. ischemic risk zone and
necrosis were expressed as a percentage of the weight
of the left ventricle.

statistical analyses
data were tabulated and calculated using excel
worksheets. all statistical analyses were performed
using sas (version 6.04; cary, nc). changes in
hemodynamic variables over time and between
groups were analyzed by repeated-measures analysis
of variance. left ventricular weight, infarct size, and
area at risk were compared using the student t test,
as were measurements obtained from the echocardiogram. data are expressed as mean ± sem.

results
thirty-three rabbits were randomized to the protocol.
one heart was excluded because the risk region represented less than 10% of the left ventricle. two rabbits
died before completing the study. echocardiograms
(baseline, ischemia reperfusion) were available in 10
vehicle-treated rabbits and 13  xxxd3083xxx -treated rabbits.

risk zone and necrosis
there were no significant differences in body weight
or lv weight (data not shown). risk zone, expressed
as a percentage of lv weight, was 30% ± 2% in the
vehicle group and 24% ± 3% in the  xxxd3083xxx  group
(p = nonsignificant [ns]). by protocol design, there
was negligible necrosis after 15 minutes of ischemia,
with an average of 1% of the lv becoming necrotic
in both groups (p = ns).

regional wall thickening

the heart was sliced transversely into 6 to 8 sections. the slices were photographed to identify the
area at risk (no blue dye). to detect any necrosis, the
slices were incubated in a 1% solution of triphenyltetrazolium chloride for 15 minutes, immersed in formalin,

fractional thickening, a marker of regional contraction,
was similar in both groups at baseline (table 1). during
the ischemic period, free-wall fractional thickening
(fwft) was reduced in both groups from baseline contraction; however, function was significantly better

end-diastolic and end-systolic volumes
end-diastolic volume was increased during ischemia
and decreased at the end of reperfusion compared with

however, the increase was significantly less in the

discussion
 xxxd3083xxx  has been shown to be cardioprotective
in the setting of heart failure,24-26 and several studies
have shown improvements in lv function after acute
myocardial infarction18,19,21,27 and in isolated working
hearts subjected to low-flow or global ischemia.20,28,29 for
example, in isolated, working rat hearts, mccormack
et al30 found that under normoxic conditions,  xxxd3083xxx 
treatment (10 µmol/l) itself had no effect on baseline

hemodynamic or contractile parameters. after 30 minutes of low-flow ischemia and reflow for 1 hour, indices
of functional recovery such as cardiac work and rate/
pressure product were statistically better in ranolazineperfused hearts than in control hearts when treatment
was initiated before the onset of ischemia. in a model of
global ischemia in langendorff-perfused rabbit hearts,
pretreatment with  xxxd3083xxx  significantly reduced the
release of creatine kinase and improved lv developed
pressure and dp/dt during reperfusion. gralinski and
coworkers also noted that the increase in tissue calcium
seen in control hearts was completely prevented by
20 µm  xxxd3083xxx .20
not all studies have shown a cardioprotective
effect on infarct size with  xxxd3083xxx  treatment.
black and coworkers tested  xxxd3083xxx  in a canine
model of 90-minute coronary artery occlusion and
18 hours of reperfusion.31 treatment (3.3 mg/kg for
2 minutes and 7.2 mg/kg/h) was initiated 30 minutes
before onset of ischemia. no significant differences
were noted between the 2 groups in creatine kinase
release or in anatomic infarct size expressed as a
percentage of the risk zone. in contrast, we have
previously shown a reduction in myocardial infarct
size and better recovery of lv function after 60 minutes of ischemia and 3 hours of reperfusion when
rabbits were treated with  xxxd3083xxx  prior to coronary artery occlusion.21
to our knowledge, this is the first study to test
 xxxd3083xxx  (2 mg/kg bolus, injected over 60 seconds,
plus 60 µg/kg/min) for possible cardioprotective effects
in an in vivo model of transient regional ischemia,
which does not result in necrosis but does result in
impaired lv function. data from this study show less
lv dysfunction during ischemia and a reduction in
myocardial stunning manifested by improved postischemic wall thickening and better regional ejection
fraction after brief ischemia and reperfusion with
 xxxd3083xxx  treatment. this improvement was independent of differences in hemodynamics because heart rate,
arterial pressure, and contractility were similar in both
groups.
 xxxd3083xxx  is a clinically used antianginal agent
and was previously shown in several clinical trials to
reduce the frequency of angina episodes and to prolong exercise time in patients with coronary artery
disease.32-37 it has been shown to be effective used
alone36 or in combination with other agents used in
the treatment of angina.37 in contrast with other
antianginal treatments that work by decreasing indices

of cardiac work,  xxxd3083xxx  does not affect heart rate or
blood pressure, suggesting a different mode of action.
several hypotheses have been proposed to explain
the mechanism of action for  xxxd3083xxx ’s benefit in
the setting of myocardial ischemia. initially, it was
thought that  xxxd3083xxx  functions by partially
inhibiting fatty acid oxidation, shifting metabolism
during ischemia toward glucose oxidation with
increased efficiency of oxygen use.30 however, new
evidence suggests that the cardioprotective actions of
 xxxd3083xxx  are related to its effect of inhibiting the
late sodium channel current (late ina) in cardiac
cells.15,17,38 the late ina can be increased by ischemic
metabolites16,39 and by oxygen free radicals released at
reperfusion.40 the amplitude of the sodium influx via
the late sodium channel current represents less than
1% of the peak, but a substantial increase of sodium
into the cell can occur during this phase of the
action potential, which can lead to subsequent intracellular calcium overload via the  xxxg2161xxx .
calcium overload in myocytes can lead to mechanical
dysfunction.

summary
the results of this study show that  xxxd3083xxx  treatment provides protection during a brief episode of
ischemia associated with impairment in lv function in
the absence of necrosis.  xxxd3083xxx  treatment
improved function during ischemia and reduced
myocardial stunning, improving risk area wall thickening and regional ejection fraction during reperfusion.
these data suggest that inhibiting the late sodium
channel current may be a novel approach to treating
stunning independent of effects on hemodynamics.
