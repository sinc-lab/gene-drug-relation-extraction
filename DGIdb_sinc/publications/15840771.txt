levels change in hydrated and dehydrated conditions and thus control
osmotic water permeability (pf) of the inner medullary collecting duct
(imcd).  xxxd1903xxx  (pge2) antagonizes vasopressin-induced
pf of imcd. previously, we showed that activation of  xxxg1646xxx  receptor
( xxxg1646xxx -r) in imcd results in production and release of pge2, and
 xxxg1646xxx -r mrna and protein are significantly elevated in inner medullas of hydrated rats compared with dehydrated rats. therefore, we
examined whether the altered expression of  xxxg1646xxx -r in hydrated and
dehydrated states is associated with corresponding changes in  xxxg1646xxx -mediated pge2 release by the imcd. rats were hydrated by
providing sucrose water as the sole drinking fluid or dehydrated by
water deprivation for 2 days. this resulted in high output-low osmolality and low output-high osmolality urines in hydrated and dehydrated rats, respectively. in hydrated rats, there was a significant
increase in tubular fluid pge2, measured indirectly by assessing the
urinary pge2 metabolite. stimulation of freshly isolated imcd preparations in vitro with  xxxg1646xxx -r agonist (atp␥s) showed a marked
increase in the release of pge2 in hydrated rats compared with normal
rats. these responses were blunted in the imcd prepared from
dehydrated rats. the  xxxg1646xxx -r-mediated pge2 release in the imcd of
hydrated rats was mediated largely by cyclooxygenase (cox)-1 as
cox-1-specific inhibitor valeroyl salicylate completely blocked the
release. the cox-2-specific inhibitor n5398 had only a modest and
insignificant inhibitory effect. in conclusion, the increased sensitivity
of purinergic-prostanoid interaction seen in the imcd of hydrated rats
may represent a novel vasopressin-independent regulatory mechanism
of imcd function.

the reabsorption of water by the kidney is crucial for the
conservation of body water and excretion of concentrated
urine. within the kidney, the collecting duct system is the site
of regulated water reabsorption. it is under the control of the
neurohypophyseal hormone  xxxd3495xxx  (avp). avp,
acting through its  xxxg231xxx , a g protein-coupled receptor on
the collecting duct principal cells, activates membrane-bound
adenylyl cyclase to produce camp as a second messenger.

increased cellular camp levels mediate the short- and longterm effects of avp on the collecting duct water transport. the
short-term response involves translocation of aquaporin-2
(aqp2) water channels from a pool of subapical vesicles to
apical plasma membrane, which is the rate-limiting barrier in
the transcellular movement of water (26). the long-term effect
involves transcriptional activation of aqp2 gene by camp
through cre and  xxxg1222xxx  sites in aqp2 promoter (13, 23, 41).
this results in increased accumulation of aqp2 protein in the
collecting duct (7, 16, 34).
in rats subjected to water loading or hydration, urine osmolality and circulating levels of avp are very low, similar to the
condition of compulsive water drinking seen in humans. these
are associated with decreased protein abundance and/or altered
subcellular localization of avp-regulated water channel aqp2
in the inner medulla (34). conversely, water deprivation or
dehydration results in elevated urine osmolality and circulating
avp levels. these are associated with increased protein abundance and apical membrane targeting of aqp2 in the inner
medulla (27, 34).
apart from avp, a variety of autocrine and paractine agents,
such as pge2, endothelin, and extracellular nucleotides (atp/
utp), are known to regulate the collecting duct water permeability. acting via their respective receptors, and the associated
phosphoinositide signaling pathway, these agents decrease the
avp-stimulated osmotic water permeability of the collecting
duct (16, 20, 25, 28, 29). despite this knowledge, the roles of
locally released mediators in the regulation of medullary collecting duct water transport under physiological conditions of
hydration and water deprivation have not been explored.
all renal cells are known to release nucleotides into the
extracellular milieu in a regulated fashion (30, 31). pharmacological, physiological, electrophysiological, and molecular
studies have unraveled the autocrine and/or paracrine signaling
elicited by extracellular nucleotides through p2 purinergic
receptors. p2 receptors have been shown to regulate glomerular, microvascular, and epithelial functions of the kidney (14,
22, 31, 32, 35).  xxxg1646xxx  receptor is a g protein-coupled extracellular nucleotide receptor. it has been identified and localized
in the rat inner medullary collecting duct (imcd) (9, 17). we
demonstrated that the agonist activation of  xxxg1646xxx  receptor
downregulates avp-stimulated osmotic water permeability in
isolated, microperfused rat imcd by decreasing cellular

 xxxg1646xxx -mediated pge2 release by imcd

camp levels in a protein kinase c-dependent manner (16).
recently, we showed that  xxxg1646xxx  receptor stimulation triggers the production and release of pge2 by rat imcd
preparations in a  xxxg1883xxx  (cox-1) activity-dependent manner (36). thus our studies indicate that in rat
imcd, signaling through  xxxg1646xxx  receptor drives the production of pge2. this has important physiological significance,
because pge2 is known to affect the transport of water, salt,
and urea in imcd (25, 28, 29).
more recently, we observed that the expression of  xxxg1646xxx 
receptor mrna and protein in the inner medulla is altered by
the hydration status of the animals. thus, in hydrated rats the
expression of  xxxg1646xxx  receptor mrna and protein in the inner
medulla is significantly higher compared with the dehydrated
rats (18). this prompted us to hypothesize that the altered
expression of  xxxg1646xxx  receptor in hydrated and dehydrated conditions may be associated with changes in  xxxg1646xxx  receptordriven pge2 production by the imcd. in this study, we
examined that possibility.
materials and methods

experimental animals. the animal experiments were carried out
according to the protocols approved by the institutional animal care
and use committees of the university of utah and va salt lake city
health care system. specific pathogen-free male sprague-dawley
rats (harlan, indianapolis, in) were housed two or three per cage in
the veterinary medical unit of the va salt lake city health care
system. this is an american association for accreditation of laboratory animal care (aaalac)-accredited and us department of
agriculture (usda)- and public health service (phs)-approved
animal facility. the rats were maintained in pathogen-free state and
fed ad libitum a commercial rodent diet. they had free access to
drinking water unless restricted by the experimental protocol. the rats
were acclimated to the housing conditions for about a week before
experiments were conducted. the rats weighed 294 ⫾ 8 g (means ⫾
se) at the time of euthanasia.
hydration and dehydration of rats. hydration and dehydration of
rats were achieved according to the protocol described earlier (18).
briefly, hydrated rats received 600 mm sucrose (commercially available dietary  xxxd3253xxx ) in tap water for 2 days (48 h) as the sole
drinking fluid. the sweetness of the sucrose solution caused the rats
to drink large amounts of fluid and thus established a hydrated state
associated with diuresis. the dehydrated rats were deprived of water
for 2 days (48 h). in addition to the hydrated and dehydrated rats, a
group of normal rats was included, which received only tap water ad
libitum. all rats had free access to pelleted chow.
collection and analysis of urine samples. urine samples were
collected from rats by placing them in individual plastic metabolic
cages during the last 24 h of the experimental period, just before
euthanasia. after collection, volumes of 24-h urine samples were
noted. aliquots of urine samples were centrifuged to remove suspended particles. the supernatants were used to measure osmolality
by vapor pressure method (wescor model 5100c, wescor, logan,
ut). in some groups of hydrated, dehydrated, and normal rats, pge2
metabolite in urine was assayed using  xxxd1903xxx  metabolite eia
kit (catalog no. 514531; cayman chemical, ann arbor, mi). pge2
in blood, urine, and other body fluids is not stable. it is rapidly
converted into its 13,14-dihydro-15-keto metabolite. the  xxxd1903xxx  metabolite assay kit converts all of the immediate pge2
metabolites in the urine samples to a single, stable derivative that
could be easily quantified by eia. according to the manufacturer, this
assay system has 100% specificity toward bicyclo  xxxd124xxx ;
13,14-dihydro-15-keto  xxxd124xxx  and 13,14-dihydro-15-keto pge2. specificity toward other prostanoids or leukotrienes or thromboxanes is

⬍0.01%. urine samples were processed for the assay according the
manufacturer’s instructions. briefly, to aliquots (500 ␮l) of each urine
sample 150 ␮l of 1 m carbonate buffer were added and incubated at
37°c overnight. then, 200 ␮l of phosphate buffer followed by 150 ␮l
of eia buffer (both supplied) were added. urine samples were diluted
10-, 20-, or 50-fold. fifty microliters of each dilution were used in the
eia. the absorbance of the final color product was read spectrophotometrically at 405 nm in a spectra max 250 microplate reader
(molecular devices, menlo park, ca). the raw data from the plate
reader were stored in a computer and analyzed using soft maxpro
software (molecular devices). the measured amounts of pge2 metabolite in the urine samples were normalized to the 24-h urine output
and expressed as picograms of pge2 metabolite per 24 h.
preparation of fractions enriched in imcd. fractions enriched in
imcd were prepared from rat kidney inner medullas as described
previously (19, 36). briefly, rats were euthanized by pentobarbital
sodium overdose. both kidneys were removed rapidly and chilled on
ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. the inner medullas or papillas
were dissected. the dissected papillas were transferred to an isotonic
hepes-buffered physiological solution of the following composition
(in mm): 135 nacl, 0.5 kcl, 0.1 na2hpo4, 0.3 sodium acetate, 0.12
na2so4, 2.5 cacl2, 1.2  xxxd2534xxx , 5 hepes, and 5.5 d-glucose (ph 7.4,
300 –310 mosmol/kgh2o). this solution was oxygenated by bubbling
in 95% o2-5% co2. because earlier studies showed that pge2
synthesis in imcd is sensitive to increasing osmolality of the medium
(15), we carried out all our experiments in ⬃300 mosmol/kgh2o
medium to exclude variability due to osmolality. depending on the
nature of the experiment, renal papillas from three or four rats were
pooled to obtain a sufficient amount of imcd preparations for
incubations. the pooled papillas were minced with a razor blade. the
minced tissue was then digested at 37°c with collagenase b (3 mg/ml)
and hyaluronidase (600 u/ml) in the same hepes-buffered physiological solution for ⬃40 –50 min with continuous oxygenation. midway through the digestion process, dnase i (sigma, st. louis, mo)
was added to the digestion mixture to digest stray dna released from
broken cells. the digestion mixture was intermittently aspirated into
and pushed through a glass pasteur pipette with a long, narrow tip to
disperse the tubules into a uniform suspension. after digestion of the
tubules into a uniform suspension, the imcd fraction was separated
from the non-imcd elements (thin limbs and vasculature) by sedimentation by low-speed centrifugation and repeated washings. the
final pellet was suspended in the oxygenated hepes-buffered physiological solution to a protein concentration of ⬃1 mg/ml. the final
suspension was kept on ice for ⬃30 min to allow for recovery of
imcd cells from stress. this preparation consisted of mostly imcd
segments or sheets of imcd cells and a very few other non-imcd
elements. characterization of imcd preparations obtained by this
procedure for enrichment in imcd and for cell viability has been
documented earlier (19, 36).
incubation of imcd preparations. fractions enriched in imcd
were incubated with or without the addition of inhibitors of cox
and/or atp␥s. at the end of the incubation, the amount of pge2
released from the cells was assayed as described previously (36).
briefly, after keeping the imcd preparations on ice for 30 min for
recovery from stress, they were aliquoted into 1.5-ml plastic microtubes kept on ice. atp␥s stock solution (⫻10 final incubation
concentration) was prepared in the same oxygenated hepes-buffered
physiological solution used for the preparation of imcd suspensions.
stock solutions of valeroyl salicylate and ns-398 were prepared by
dissolving in dmso at a very high concentration, aliquoted, and
frozen at ⫺20°c. these stock solutions were diluted freshly before
use with the hepes-buffered physiological solution to give a ⫻10
final incubation concentration. the aliquots of imcd suspensions
were warmed to 37°c for 5 min on heat blocks before the agents were
added. when atp␥s alone was used without any cox inhibitors, the
incubations were started immediately after the 5-min warm-up period
and lasted for 10 or 20 min depending on the nature of the experiment.

 xxxg1646xxx -mediated pge2 release by imcd

when the cox inhibitors were used, the imcd were initially
warmed-up for 5 min. then, they were preincubated with the inhibitors for 5 or 15 min depending on the type of the inhibitor used. this
was followed by incubation for another 20 min after the addition of
atp␥s. to control incubations that did not contain any inhibitor
and/or atp␥s, equal volumes of vehicle (incubation buffer) were
added, so that all the incubations had a final volume of 200 ␮l.
incubations were carried out either in triplicate or quadruplicate. to
stop the reactions, chilled hepes-buffered physiological solution
(200 ␮l) was added and the tubes were kept on ice for a few minutes.
the tubes were then centrifuged  xxxd1891xxx ,000 g for 10 min in a cold room
(4°c). and 350 ␮l of the supernatant from each tube were transferred
to a fresh tube and stored at ⫺80°c until assayed for the pge2
content. the pellets with the remaining 50 ␮l of incubation buffer
were frozen at ⫺20°c for protein assay.
assay of pge2. pge2 content in the supernatants from the incubations was determined according to the instructions of the manufacturer using the  xxxd1903xxx  eia kit monoclonal (catalog no.
514010; cayman chemical). the absorbance of the product was read
spectrophotometrically at 405 nm in a spectra max 250 microplate
reader (molecular devices). according to the manufacturer, this assay
system has a specificity of 100% to pge2 and pge2 ethanolamide,
37.4% specificity to 8-iso pge2, and 43 and 18.7% to pge3 and
 xxxd124xxx . for the assays, frozen supernatants were thawed on ice and
diluted with eia buffer to yield final dilutions in the range of 1:200
to 1:2,000 with respect to the original incubation. the assays were run
on 50 ␮l of these diluted samples. the raw data from the plate reader
were stored in a computer and analyzed using soft maxpro software
(molecular devices). the protein content in each sample was measured to normalize for cell population present in each sample. protein
pellets prepared from the imcd cell suspension samples were thawed
at room temperature. cellular proteins were precipitated and delipidated by addition of methanol. after separation of methanol by
centrifugation and drying, the protein pellets were dissolved in 0.05 n
naoh. aliquots of the clear solutions thus obtained were assayed for
the protein content by coomassie plus protein assay reagent kit
(pierce endogen, rockford, il) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. the concentrations of pge2 in the incubations were
normalized with the corresponding protein content and expressed as
nanograms of pge2 released per milligram of protein. the day-to-day
coefficient of variation of this assay in our hands was 3–13% in the
linear range of the standard curve (10 –90% binding of tracer).

compared with the normal rats. thus there are dramatic differences between dehydrated and hydrated groups with respect to
urine volume and osmolality.
urinary pge2 metabolite in normal, dehydrated, and hydrated rats. urine samples collected from normal, dehydrated,
and hydrated rats during the last 24 h of the experimental
period were assayed for pge2 metabolite content after appropriate dilution, using a commercial eia kit. the urinary excretion of pge2 metabolite over 24 h in normal, dehydrated,
and hydrated rats is shown in fig. 2. in contrast to normal rats,
the mean urinary excretion of pge2 metabolite in dehydrated
rats was only ⬃12%, whereas it was increased to ⬃142% in
hydrated rats. thus the hydrated group showed ⬃12-fold
higher urinary excretion of pge2 metabolite than the dehydrated group.
 xxxg1646xxx  receptor-stimulated release of pge2 by the imcd

fractions enriched in imcd were prepared from inner medullas of normal, dehydrated, and hydrated rats and challenged

figure 3 shows the amount of pge2 released following agonist
stimulation vs. unstimulated imcd (vehicle control) in different groups of rats. agonist stimulation of  xxxg1646xxx  receptor in
imcd of normal rats caused a modest but significant 50%
increase in pge2 released when directly compared with the
corresponding vehicle-treated group by unpaired t-test. in the
hydrated group,  xxxg1646xxx  receptor stimulation caused 136% increase in pge2 release over the unstimulated values. in contrast, the dehydrated group did not show any change. thus,
when stimulated by atp␥s, imcd from hydrated rats released
⬎5- and 2.4-fold higher amounts of pge2 compared with the
dehydrated and normal groups, respectively. basal amounts of
pge2 released during the experimental period by the unstimulated imcd were numerically higher in hydrated and lower in
dehydrated groups compared with the normal group, although
these differences were not statistically significant when analyzed by anova.

 xxxg1646xxx -mediated pge2 release by imcd

effect of cox-1 inhibition on atp␥s-stimulated pge2 release by imcd from hydrated rats. because imcd of dehydrated rats showed virtually none or insignificant response to
atp␥s-stimulated pge2 release, here we examined the imcd
from the hydrated rats only with respect to their sensitivity to
cox-1 inhibition. figure 6 shows the effect of valeroyl salicylate, a selective, irreversible inhibitor or cox-1 (3), on
atp␥s (50 ␮m)-stimulated pge2 release by imcd from
hydrated rats. as shown in the figure, lower concentrations of
valeroyl salicylate (30 ␮m) produced little inhibition of the
atp␥s-stimulated pge2 release. however, 300 ␮m valeroyl
salicylate completely inhibited the atp␥s-stimulated release
of pge2 by the imcd from hydrated rats. although there were
some differences in the level of pge2 released during the
fig. 2. urinary excretion of pge2 metabolite in normal, dehydrated, and
hydrated rats. twenty-four-hour urine samples were collected and processed
for the assay of pge2 metabolite as described in materials and methods.
based on the volume of urine collected, urinary pge2 metabolite excreted over
24-h period was calculated. data show means ⫾ se for 6 rats in each group.

**significantly different from the normal group, p ⬍ 0.001 by anova.

time course of atp␥s-stimulated pge2 release by imcd
from dehydrated and hydrated rats. the large differences in
urine volume, osmolality, and urinary pge2 metabolite observed in dehydrated and hydrated groups represented the
cumulative changes that occurred over a 48-h period. therefore, to assess the potential kinetic differences in the response
between dehydrated and hydrated rats, we directly compared
the time course of atp␥s-stimulated pge2 release by imcd
prepared from these two groups. figure 4 shows the time
course of pge2 release by imcd from dehydrated and hydrated rats after stimulation with 50 ␮m atp␥s or no stimulation (vehicle). as shown in the figure, stimulated or unstimulated imcd from dehydrated rats showed virtually no increase
in the pge2 release over time. on the other hand, unstimulated
imcd from hydrated rats showed a gradual increase over time,
attaining statistical significance at 80 min. however, the stimulated imcd from hydrated rats showed dramatic 3.3-, 5.2-,
and 6.3-fold increases at 20, 40, and 80 min. thus the imcd
from dehydrated and hydrated rats differed markedly in their
ability to respond to  xxxg1646xxx  receptor-stimulated pge2 release
over time. these results seen with the imcd from hydrated
rats for the time course of atp␥s-stimulated pge2 release
were qualitatively similar to what we observed previously with
imcd from normal rats (36) but were quantitatively higher.
effect of different concentrations of atp␥s on pge2 release
by imcd from dehydrated and hydrated rats. in parallel to the
time course of atp␥s-stimulated pge2 release by imcd, we
tested atp␥s concentration response using imcd from dehydrated and hydrated rats. previously, we characterized the
atp␥s concentration response in imcd of normal rats (36).
figure 5 shows atp␥s concentration-response curve for the
release of pge2 by imcd from dehydrated and hydrated rats
following 10-min incubation. as shown in fig. 5, in hydrated
rats, there was an initial rapid increase even  xxxd1891xxx  ␮m,
followed by a more sustained increase up to 100 ␮m atp␥s
concentration. in contrast, imcd from dehydrated rats did not
show significant increase of pge2 release at any atp␥s
concentration tested.

discussion

in this communication, we documented four major findings.
first, we demonstrated that urinary excretion of pge2, which
reflects tubular fluid synthesis in vivo, is significantly higher in
hydrated rats and lower in dehydrated rats compared with the
normal rats. second, we showed that ex vivo purinergicstimulated pge2 release by imcd is markedly elevated in
hydrated rats compared with the normal or dehydrated rats.
third, we demonstrated that purinergic-stimulated increase in
pge2 release by imcd of hydrated rats is time and agonist
concentration dependent. finally, we document that purinergic-stimulated pge2 release by imcd of hydrated rats is
mediated by cox-1 but not cox-2. because pge2 is known
to affect transport of water, salt, and urea by imcd (25, 28,
29), the documented enhancement of purinergic-driven prostanoid production in imcd of hydrated rats may constitute a
potent avp-independent regulatory mechanism.
in recent years, the potential roles of extracellular nucleotides in the regulation of renal tubular transport, especially that

the functional antagonism of pge2 on avp-stimulated water

however, only recently the cell biological mechanisms of this
antagonistic effect have been unraveled. using ex vivo preparations of renal medulla, zelenina et al. (42) demonstrated that

 xxxg1646xxx -mediated pge2 release by imcd

retrieval of aqp2 water channel from the apical membrane.
this effectively reduces the abundance of aqp2 protein in the
apical membrane, the rate-limiting barrier in the transepithelial
water movement in the collecting duct.
recently, we observed that expression of  xxxg1646xxx  receptor
mrna and protein is significantly higher in the inner medulla
of hydrated rats compared with the dehydrated rats (18). this
prompted us to examine whether the observed increase in
 xxxg1646xxx  receptor expression in hydrated rats is also associated
with an increased purinergic-stimulated pge2 release by the
imcd. to address this question, we used a model of freshly
prepared imcd fractions from collagenase- and hyaluronidase-digested rat inner medullas. this is a well-characterized
model for the study of hormonal response of imcd. in our
previous communications, we validated the purity and viability
of the imcd preparation (17, 19, 36). furthermore, based on
the currently available experimental data, we can safely ascertain that  xxxg1646xxx  receptor is perhaps the only p2 receptor whose
expression in “native rat imcd” is characterized by molecular,
pharmacological, and functional approaches (9, 16, 17). although the presence of other p2 receptors has been reported in
cultured cell lines of renal collecting duct origin, such as
mimcd-3 cells (37), their presence in native rat imcd has not
been established. furthermore,  xxxg81xxx  has been
localized and characterized in the rat imcd (10, 38). however,
the use of atp␥s, a nonhydrolyzable form of atp, as a ligand
in our experiments precluded the stimulation of functional
adenosine receptors in our system.
every renal structure produces pge2. however, the medullary collecting duct accounts for ⬃66% of the total pge2
synthesized in the kidney. pge2 produced in other renal
structures is very low (3 to 6% of the total for each segment)
(4). the release of synthesized prostaglandins from the cells,
including collecting duct principal cells, is facilitated via specific prostaglandin transporters in the cell membranes (1).
prostaglandins that enter the tubular lumen are partially reabsorbed from the urine, and urinary prostaglandins probably
reflect renal synthesis (8). in our study, the pattern of urinary
excretion of pge2 metabolite in normal, dehydrated, and
hydrated rats has parallels to the  xxxg1646xxx  receptor-stimulated
pge2 release by the imcd in these groups. it is very striking
to note the large differences between dehydrated and hydrated
rats with respect to the urinary excretion of pge2 metabolite as
well as to the  xxxg1646xxx  receptor-stimulated pge2 release by the
imcd. these observations indicate that the urinary excretion
of pge2 metabolite represents the in vivo production and
release of pge2 by medullary collecting duct under the conditions of hydration and dehydration.
in our earlier study, we documented that the atp␥s-stimulated pge2 by imcd of normal rats was 4.3-fold over the
unstimulated values after 60 min of incubation (36). in the
current study, the stimulated pge2 release by imcd of hydrated rats was five- and sixfold over the unstimulated values
after 40 and 80 min of incubation, respectively (fig. 4).
similarly, the concentration-response curve for release of
 xxxg1646xxx  receptor-stimulated pge2 by imcd of normal rats
attained a plateau over 25 ␮m atp␥s concentration (36).
however, the corresponding concentration-response curve for
the imcd of hydrated rats showed a tendency for continued
increase between 50 to 100 ␮m atp␥s despite a large variation at 100 ␮m atp␥s concentration (fig. 5). these data

indicate that hydration of rats sensitizes the purinergic signaling system in the imcd. such sensitization results in increased
production of pge2 when the imcd are exposed to concentrations of extracellular atp that are comparable to the ones
found in normal rats. based on our current and previous data
(36), we predict that the set point of activity of purinergic
signaling is altered in the imcd of hydrated rats compared
with normal or dehydrated rats. this lowered threshold for
purinergic signaling in hydrated rats results in enhanced production of pge2 at extracellular concentrations of atp that are
comparable to the ones seen in normal rats.
almost every renal cell constitutively expresses cox-1. in
contrast, cox-2 distribution in normal kidney is limited to
only macula densa cells in the cortex and interstitial cells in the
medulla. however, an increase in the medullary tonicity, such
as that seen in dehydrated conditions, is known to induce
cox-2, but not cox-1, expression in the medullary collecting
duct cells of rat (40). our observation on the cox-1 activitydependent production of pge2 in the imcd of normal and
hydrated polyuric rats is consistent with the expression of
 xxxg1646xxx  receptor and the constitutive expression of cox-1, but
not cox-2, in imcd cells under these conditions. previous
studies from our laboratories showed that concentrations of
ns-398 used in the current experiments inhibited cox-2mediated effects in cultured cortical neuronal cells (6). there is
a possibility that our imcd preparation may contain a few
medullary interstitial cells, which express abundant amounts of
cox-2 mrna and protein (12). yet, it is unlikely that these
cells are stimulated by atp␥s, because our immunohistochemical studies could not detect  xxxg1646xxx  receptor protein in medullary
interstitial cells (17; and kishore, unpublished observations). our
results on the lack of cox-2 activity dependency in normal and
hydrated rats are also consistent with this notion. on the other
hand, it is interesting to note that the basal production of pge2 in
the imcd of dehydrated rats is low. in addition, atp␥s failed to
stimulate any noticeable increase in pge2 release, despite the fact
that cox-2 expression is induced in imcd cells by dehydration.
this finding leads to two important conclusions. first, the cox-2
expression in the imcd of dehydrated rats is not associated with
production and/or release of significant amounts of pge2. it may
play a role in the survival of medullary cells under hypertonic
conditions as suggested by yang et al. (39). second, the signal
transduction from the stimulation of  xxxg1646xxx  receptor to the production of pge2 in imcd appears to be specifically coupled to the
cox-1 activity. evidence for such functional coupling of prostanoid biosynthetic enzymes in various cells does exist (21, 24).
in conclusion, our study has important physiological significance with regard to the role of purinergic regulation of
medullary collecting duct function in conditions of hydration
and dehydration. this provides a basis for the operation of
avp-independent regulatory mechanisms that determine the
overall function of imcd in these conditions. our study also
emphasizes the complex nature of the interaction between the
purinergic and prostanoid systems and the intracellular coupling pathways involved in such interaction.
