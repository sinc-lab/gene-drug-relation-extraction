sulfonylurea stimulation of insulin secretion
peter proks,1 frank reimann,2 nick green,1 fiona gribble,2 and frances ashcroft1

sulfonylureas are widely used to treat type 2 diabetes
because they stimulate insulin secretion from pancreatic ␤-cells. they primarily act by binding to the sur
subunit of the atp-sensitive potassium (katp) channel
and inducing channel closure. however, the channel is
still able to open to a limited extent when the drug is
bound, so that high-affinity sulfonylurea inhibition is
not complete, even at saturating drug concentrations.
katp channels are also found in cardiac, skeletal, and
smooth muscle, but in these tissues are composed of
different sur subunits that confer different drug
sensitivities. thus  xxxd3394xxx  and  xxxd2202xxx  block
channels containing  xxxg19xxx  (␤-cell type), but not  xxxg20xxx 
(cardiac, smooth muscle types), whereas  xxxd2215xxx ,
 xxxd2203xxx ,  xxxd3098xxx , and meglitinide block both
types of channels. this difference has been exploited
to determine residues contributing to the sulfonylurea-binding site. sulfonylurea block is decreased by
mutations or agents (e.g., phosphatidylinositol bisphosphate) that increase  xxxg1253xxx  open probability. we
now propose a kinetic model that explains this effect in
terms of changes in the channel open probability and in
the transduction between the drug-binding site and the
channel gate. we also clarify the mechanism by which
mgadp produces an apparent increase of sulfonylurea
efficacy on channels containing  xxxg19xxx  (but not  xxxg20xxx ).

ulfonylureas stimulate insulin secretion from
pancreatic ␤-cells and are widely used to treat
type 2 diabetes. their principal target is the
atp-sensitive potassium (katp) channel, which
plays a major role in controlling the ␤-cell membrane
potential. inhibition of katp channels by glucose or sulfonylureas causes depolarization of the ␤-cell membrane; in
turn, this triggers the opening of voltage-gated ca2⫹ channels, eliciting ca2⫹ influx and a rise in intracellular ca2⫹
which stimulates the exocytosis of insulin-containing secretory granules (1). katp channels are also found at high
density in a variety of other cell types, including cardiac,

smooth, and skeletal muscle, and some brain neurones. in
all these tissues, opening of katp channels in response to
metabolic stress leads to inhibition of electrical activity.
thus they are involved in the response to both cardiac and
cerebral ischemia (2). they are also important in neuronal
regulation of glucose homeostasis (3), seizure protection
(4), and the control of vascular smooth muscle tone (and,
thereby, blood pressure) (5).
the  xxxg1253xxx  is a hetero-octameric complex of two
different types of protein subunits: an inwardly rectifying
k⫹ channel, kir6.x, and a sulfonylurea receptor, sur (6,7).
kir6.x belongs to the family of inwardly rectifying k⫹
(kir) channels and assembles as a tetramer to form the
channel pore (fig. 1a). binding of atp to the intracellular
domains of this subunit produces channel inhibition (8).
sur is a member of the  xxxg22xxx  family, with 17
transmembrane helices (tms), arranged as one group of 5
tms, and two repeats each of 6 tms followed by a large
cytosolic loop containing consensus sequences for nucleotide binding and hydrolysis. interaction of mg nucleotides
with the nucleotide-binding domains (nbds) mediates activation of the  xxxg1253xxx  (9 –12). sur also endows  xxxg1250xxx 
with sensitivity to certain drugs, such as the inhibitory
sulfonylureas and the stimulatory k⫹ channel openers
(6,7).
more than one isoform exists for both kir6.x ( xxxg150xxx   xxxg1255xxx ,
 xxxg1250xxx ) and sur ( xxxg19xxx , sur2a, sur2b). in most tissues,
 xxxg1250xxx  serves as the pore-forming subunit, but it associates
with different sur subunits; for example, it associates
with  xxxg19xxx  in the pancreas and brain; sur2a in heart and
skeletal muscle; and sur2b in brain and smooth muscle
(13–15). in vascular smooth muscle, the  xxxg1253xxx  is
composed of  xxxg150xxx   xxxg1255xxx  in association with sur2b. variation
in the subunit composition of the  xxxg1253xxx  accounts
for the different metabolic and drug sensitivities of katp
channels in different cells.
inhibitors of  xxxg1253xxx  activity fall into two groups:
those that interact with  xxxg1250xxx  and those that interact with
sur. imidazolines (e.g.,  xxxd2914xxx , cibenzoline) and
antimalarials (e.g., quinine, mefloquine) block katp channels by binding to  xxxg1250xxx  (16 –18). in contrast, sulfonylureas (e.g.,  xxxd3394xxx ,  xxxd2202xxx ,  xxxd2203xxx ), and
benzamido derivatives (e.g., meglitinide) close katp channels by binding with high affinity to sur (19 –21). sulfonylureas also interact with  xxxg1250xxx , but with low affinity. all
drugs that block katp channels stimulate insulin secretion,
but only those that interact with the sur subunit are used
therapeutically to treat type 2 diabetes. thus, in this
review, we focus on how studies of recombinant katp
channels have helped to elucidate the molecular mechanism of sulfonylurea inhibition.

inhibit the  xxxg1250xxx  subunit are much higher than those
found in the plasma of patients treated with the drugs.
thus, in this review, we focus on the high-affinity drugbinding site.

sulfonylureas block katp channels at two
sites

when measured in excised patches in the absence of
nucleotides, sulfonylurea block of katp channels is best
described by a two-site model (fig. 1b). the low-affinity
site is independent of sur, as a similar block is seen when
 xxxg1250xxx  is expressed in the absence of sur (20). the
high-affinity site lies on sur, as it is only present when
sur is coexpressed with  xxxg1250xxx . the presence of both lowand high-affinity sites for sulfonylureas on the  xxxg1253xxx  introduces important considerations when interpreting
experiments with these drugs. first, at high concentrations these drugs may mediate their effects via  xxxg1250xxx , and
channel inhibition therefore cannot be taken to support
the idea that they interact with the sulfonylurea receptor.
second, as discussed below, different surs endow the
 xxxg1253xxx  with variable sensitivity to low concentrations of sulfonylureas, a property that can be used to
distinguish the type of sulfonylurea receptor expressed in
different tissues. finally, to isolate effects mediated by the
high-affinity site, it is best to use a drug that shows a wide
separation between its low- and high-affinity actions, such
as  xxxd2202xxx  or  xxxd2215xxx . the low-affinity site is of no
clinical relevance, because the concentrations required to
diabetes, vol. 51, supplement 3, december 2002

because four sur subunits contribute to the  xxxg1253xxx 
complex, the question arises as to how many subunits
must bind drug to close the channel. this topic is currently
controversial. dörschner et al. (22) found that the affinity
of sulfonylurea binding to  xxxg1250xxx / xxxg19xxx  or  xxxg1250xxx /sur2b
channels is between three- and sevenfold lower than their
potency on channel inhibition (table 1). consequently,
they concluded that occupation of a single binding site is
sufficient to induce channel closure. in contrast, russ et al.
(23) found that the concentration-response relation for
[3h] xxxd2215xxx  binding to  xxxg150xxx   xxxg1255xxx /sur2b lies to the left
of that for  xxxd2215xxx  block of channel activity, so that
the kd is sevenfold lower than the half-maximal inhibitory
concentration on channel activity (ic50) (table 1). they
therefore suggested that  xxxd2215xxx  can bind independently to four identical sites on the channel and that
occupation of all four sites is required for channel closure
(23). interestingly, the different proposed stoichiometries
arise from the different binding affinities measured by
these groups (table 1). it is not clear why the affinities
were found to be so different, but possible confounding
factors include the nature of the kir6.x subunit ( xxxg1250xxx  or
 xxxg150xxx   xxxg1255xxx ) and the nucleotide concentrations used. the conflicting results suggest that conclusions based on comparing binding affinities with potencies of channel inhibition
may not be reliable.
sulfonylurea-bound channels can still open

in the absence of added nucleotides, high-affinity inhibition of the katp current by sulfonylureas is not complete,
but reaches a maximum of 60 – 80% (fig. 1b). there are
several possible explanations for this finding. one possibility is that some percentage of the channels are in a state
in which they do not bind drug with high affinity. an
alternative possibility is that all channels bind drug with
high affinity, but they are still able to open when drug is
bound, albeit with lower probability. single-channel currents recorded at sulfonylurea concentrations that saturate the high-affinity site (but do not interact with  xxxg1250xxx )
can be used to distinguish between these possibilities. if
some channels exist in a low-affinity state and others in a
high-affinity state, and transitions between these states are
relatively slow, there should be two kinetically distinct
populations of channels— one with a reduced open probability (po) and another with kinetics similar to that
observed in the absence of drug. on the other hand, if the
reason for incomplete block by sulfonylureas is because
the channel can still open when the drug is bound at the
high-affinity site(s), then there will be only one type of
single-channel kinetics. under experimental conditions,
only a single type of kinetic behavior has been observed in
the presence of sulfonylureas (24; p.p., f.m.a., unpublished observations), supporting the idea that the channel
can still open when drug is bound. because it is thought
that each  xxxg19xxx  monomer binds drug independently, all
four binding sites should be occupied at saturating drug

concentrations. thus it appears that the  xxxg1253xxx  can
still open, even when each of its four sur subunits has
bound sulfonylurea.
the maximal extent of block at the high-affinity site can
be modulated by mutations or truncations in either  xxxg1250xxx 
or sur (25–28), or by membrane phospholipids such as
phosphatidylinositol bisphosphate (pip2) (29). all these
modulators share the common property that they increase
the channel po (25–27,30,31). we therefore simulated the
effect of po on sulfonylurea block using the kinetic scheme
given in fig. 2b and rate constants calculated from single
 xxxg1250xxx / xxxg19xxx  channel kinetics recorded in the absence and
presence of  xxxd2202xxx .
as fig. 2a shows, katp channels exhibit bursts of
openings separated by long closed periods.  xxxd2202xxx 
reduces the duration of the bursts of openings and increases the long closed intervals. the burst can be described by one open (o) and one short closed (c1) state,
and the long closings between bursts can be lumped
together into a single long closed state (c2). we assume
that all these states can bind sulfonylurea, so that the
channel can exist in both open and closed states when
sulfonylurea is bound. we further assume that when drug
is bound to  xxxg19xxx , this either has no effect on channel
activity (bound but untransduced states) or results in a
conformational change that affects the channel kinetics
(bound and transduced states). in the former case, the
channel flickers between states ob, c1b, and c2b with the
same rate constants as in the absence of drug. in the
second case, the channel undergoes a conformational
change that either results in channel closure (the ob to ct
transition) or stabilization of the closed state (c2b to c2t).
we made the simplifying assumption that the major contribution to the channel po in the presence of sulfonylurea
is produced by states with only a single drug molecule
bound (i.e., only one sur in the tetramer is occupied).
s370

this model explains the incomplete block by sulfonylureas, because, even when drug is bound, the channel
does not inevitably enter the closed states c2b and ct.
entry into these closed states is not, therefore, directly
proportional to the drug concentration, and channel opening is still possible, even at very high concentrations of the
drug.
the concentration-response curve for the high-affinity
site is described by the following:
g/gc ⫽ 关1 ⫹ l ⫻ 共关s兴/ic50兲h兴/关1 ⫹ 共关s兴/ic50兲h兴

(1)

where g is the conductance in the presence of the drug, gc
is the conductance in the absence of drug, l is the fraction
of current that remains unblocked in the presence of a
saturating concentration of sulfonylurea, h is the hill
coefficient, and ic50 is the drug concentration ([s]) at
which the fraction of the current inhibitable with high
affinity is blocked by 50%. the kinetic scheme depicted in
fig. 2b allowed us to derive analytical equations that could
be used to calculate the relation between the channel po
and l (fig. 2c), and between po and ic50 (fig. 2d). it is
clear that both l and ic50 increase with po. the value of l
reaches unity when the po is maximal, which, in the case
of the  xxxg1253xxx , is ⬃0.85, so that the model predicts
that there will be no channel inhibition when po is
maximal. this has in fact been observed for channels
containing the mutation c166s, which have a po close to
maximum (27). as predicted, reducing the po of kir6.2c166s/ xxxg19xxx  channels with atp partially restored sulfonylurea sensitivity (25). the predicted effect of po on the
concentration-response curve is illustrated in fig. 2e, and
resembles that found experimentally with increasing concentrations of pip2, which also increases po (29).
deletion of the nh2-terminus of  xxxg1250xxx  ( xxxg1250xxx ⌬n) results in an increase in the channel po and a concomitant
diabetes, vol. 51, supplement 3, december 2002

p. proks and associates

reduction in  xxxd3394xxx  block when  xxxg1250xxx ⌬n is coexpressed with  xxxg19xxx  (25). the reduction in block produced by deletion of up to nine residues can be accounted
for simply by the increase in po. however, deletion of the
first fourteen nh2-terminal residues produced a complete
loss of  xxxd3394xxx  inhibition, an observation that cannot
be explained solely by an increase in po. in addition,
decreasing po with atp was unable to restore the  xxxd3394xxx  sensitivity of this deletion mutant (25). thus it
appears that nh2-terminal residues may be involved in
transducing sulfonylurea binding to  xxxg19xxx  into closure of
the  xxxg1250xxx  pore.
specificity of high-affinity sulfonylurea
block

studies of cloned channels have revealed that certain katp
channel inhibitors ( xxxd3394xxx ,  xxxd2202xxx , and  xxxd2654xxx ) (19 –21,32,33) block katp channels containing  xxxg19xxx ,
but not sur2a or sur2b, subunits with high affinity. in
contrast, meglitinide blocks all three types of cloned katp
channel with similar affinities (21). this finding has been
interpreted to indicate that sulfonylureas resembling  xxxd3394xxx  in structure interact with a binding site that is
specific to  xxxg19xxx , whereas benzamido compounds and
their derivatives (like meglitinide) interact with a site that
is common to all sur subtypes.  xxxd2215xxx  and
 xxxd2203xxx , which contain both sulfonylurea and nonsulfonylurea moieties and block both  xxxg19xxx - and sur2containing channels, are postulated to interact with both
sites on  xxxg19xxx , but only a single (benzamido-derivative)
site on  xxxg20xxx  (21,34). the binding affinities and inhibitory
potencies of these drugs for the high-affinity sites of
different types of katp channels are illustrated in table 1.
location of the sulfonylurea binding site on
sur

a single residue within the cooh-terminal set of transmembrane domains accounts for the difference in  xxxd3394xxx  sensitivity of  xxxg19xxx - and  xxxg20xxx -containing channels.
mutation of serine 1237 in the cytoplasmic loop between
tms 15 and 16 to tyrosine abolishes the high-affinity block
of  xxxg1250xxx / xxxg19xxx  channels by  xxxd3394xxx  (35),  xxxd2654xxx 
(33), and  xxxd2702xxx  (55). it is likely that this residue also
interacts with the sulfonylurea moiety of drugs such as
 xxxd2215xxx  and  xxxd2203xxx . this is suggested by the
fact that  xxxd2215xxx  block of  xxxg1250xxx / xxxg19xxx , or native

sulfonylurea stimulation of insulin secretion

␤-cell katp channels, is not easily reversed in electrophysiological recordings, whereas  xxxd2215xxx  block is rapidly reversed when  xxxg19xxx  contains the s1237y mutation.
 xxxg1250xxx / xxxg20xxx  channels, which already possess a tyrosine at
this position, also show reversible block by  xxxd2215xxx 
and  xxxd2203xxx . in addition,  xxxd2215xxx  binding to
 xxxg19xxx  is greatly decreased by the s1237y mutation (35),
whereas  xxxd2215xxx  binding to sur2b is enhanced by
the reverse mutation (36,37). thus s1237 must contribute
to the binding site for sulfonylureas on  xxxg19xxx . it is possible
that the bulkier volume of the tyrosine side chain, as
compared to serine, sterically hinders the binding of the
sulfonylurea moiety, thereby accounting for its inability to
interact with  xxxg20xxx .
the fact that  xxxd2215xxx  blocks  xxxg1250xxx / xxxg19xxx -s1237y
channels indicates that residues other than s1237 are
critical for binding of this drug. likewise, the block of
 xxxg1250xxx / xxxg19xxx  by meglitinide and  xxxd3098xxx , which do not
possess a sulfonylurea moiety, is unaltered by the s1237y
mutation (35,53), suggesting that these drugs do not interact with this residue. recent studies have shown that two
nonadjacent cytosolic loops of  xxxg19xxx , linking tms 5 and 6
and tms 15 and 16, are critical for [3h] xxxd2215xxx 
binding (38). because the tm 15–16 loop contains s1237,
this raises the possibility that the tm 5– 6 loop may
interact with benzamido compounds and their derivatives.
interestingly, the drug-binding site of the related abc
transporter  xxxg13xxx   xxxg1448xxx  also involves sites in both nh2- and
cooh-terminal parts of the protein, and the tm 5– 6 loop
is essential for high-affinity drug binding (39).
these data do not imply that only residue s1237 in the
tm 15–16 loop and unidentified residues in the tm 5– 6
loop interact with sulfonylureas. however, it is clear that
these residues are critical for high-affinity interactions.
this suggests that despite their separate location in the
primary structure of sur, the cytosolic loops between
tms 5– 6 and tms 15–16 lie in close proximity in the
three-dimensional structure of the channel. the maximal
distance between them must be the length of the  xxxd2215xxx  molecule (17 å), but because the molecule is very
flexible, they could be much closer. the location of the
sulfonylurea binding site(s) within the cytosolic loops of
sur is consistent with earlier studies suggesting an intracellular site of action for sulfonylureas (40).
interactions between  xxxg1250xxx  and sur

it is well established that the sulfonylurea receptor can
modulate the activity of  xxxg1250xxx , because binding of sulfonylureas or mgadp to sur results in a decrease or
increase of channel activity, respectively. there is growing
evidence that kir6.x can also affect the properties of sur.
co-expression of  xxxg150xxx   xxxg1255xxx  with sur2a, or mutant sur2b,
has been shown to increase the affinity of [3h] xxxd2215xxx  binding by fivefold and fourfold, respectively
(23,36). an even greater increase in affinity (eightfold) was
found when  xxxg1250xxx  was co-expressed with mutant sur2b
(36). coexpression of  xxxg1250xxx  with  xxxg19xxx  has variously been
reported to increase the affinity of [3h] xxxd2215xxx  binding (32) and to not affect it (22,41). interestingly, dörschner and colleagues (22) found no change in the
[3h] xxxd2215xxx  binding affinity of  xxxg19xxx  or  xxxg20xxx  on
co-expression with kir6.x. these discrepancies may be a
s372

result of the different experimental conditions used by the
groups or different fractions of uncoupled sur subunits in
the presence of kir6.x. it is clear that additional experiments are needed to resolve this controversy.
modulation of sulfonylurea block by pip2

the phospholipid pip2 reduces the maximal block produced by saturating concentrations of  xxxd3394xxx  (28)
and  xxxd2215xxx  (29). it also increases the ic50 of the
drug-sensitive fraction of channels. the effects of pip2 are
attenuated by the mutation r176a in  xxxg1250xxx  (29), which is
believed to reduce pip2 binding to this subunit. furthermore, negatively charged lipids reduce  xxxd2215xxx 
block with similar potency, whereas neutral or weakly
charged lipids have no effect. as described above, the
effects of pip2 on sulfonylurea sensitivity can be largely
accounted for by the increase in channel po produced by
the phospholipid. however, it is also possible that pip2
(like the nh2-terminal deletions) has additional effects on
sulfonylurea block that are masked by the effect on the
channel po.
the amount of pip2 in the membrane can vary as a
result of altered phospholipid metabolism. thus pip2 is
expected to fall in response to ischemia (because falling
atp levels reduce its generation from pip by phosphorylation) and increase when phosphatidylinositol kinases are
stimulated. this means that pip2 regulation of  xxxd2215xxx  block will also be subject to regulation.
modulation of sulfonylurea block by mg
nucleotides

as fig. 1b shows, in the excised patch, the concentrationresponse curve for  xxxg1253xxx  inhibition by sulfonylureas is best fit by assuming both high- and low-affinity
sites, with a maximum of 60 –70% block at the high-affinity
site. this is not the case when sulfonylurea block is
measured in whole cells. remarkably, sulfonylureas produce complete (⬎90%) high-affinity inhibition of both the
native ␤-cell  xxxg1253xxx  (42,43) and its cloned counterpart,  xxxg1250xxx / xxxg19xxx  (44), when measured in the whole-cell
configuration. this difference may arise because experiments on recombinant katp channels have largely been
carried out in excised patches, whereas experiments on
native katp channels have mainly been carried out in
whole cells. we therefore compared the concentrationresponse curve for  xxxd2202xxx  block of  xxxg1250xxx / xxxg19xxx  currents in the intact cell with that in the inside-out patch.
figure 3a and b shows that there was no significant
difference in the  xxxd2202xxx  concentration producing halfmaximal block of  xxxg1250xxx / xxxg19xxx  channels or native ␤-cell
katp channels when measured in the whole cell (108 ⫾ 3
and 184 ⫾ 30 nmol/l, respectively), and the maximum
block was similar, being ⬎90% in both cases. in contrast,
there was a marked difference in the maximal extent of
 xxxd2202xxx  block of  xxxg1250xxx / xxxg19xxx  currents when measured in
the intact cell and in the excised patch, which amounted to
93 and 60%, respectively.
one explanation for the difference in the shape of the
concentration-response curve in excised patches and
whole cells is that it results from the presence of intracellular mgadp, which is always present in the intact cell, but
not, unless deliberately added, in excised patches. intradiabetes, vol. 51, supplement 3, december 2002

from a holding potential of ⴚ10 mv. azide (3 mmol/l) and  xxxd2202xxx  (1
mmol/l) were added to the extracellular solution, as indicated. methods are the same as those described in ref. 42. b: mean relation

a voltage step to ⴚ100 mv in the presence of  xxxd2202xxx  (i) is expressed

block of the native ␤-cell  xxxg1253xxx  in whole-cell recordings from
mouse pancreatic ␤-cells (ic50 ⴝ 184 nmol/l) (42). c: relation between

presence of  xxxd2202xxx  (i) is expressed as a fraction of its mean

of equation 1 to the data, with ic50 ⴝ 204 nmol/l, h ⴝ 1.13, and l ⴝ

cellular mgadp has been shown to produce an apparent
increase in the efficacy of  xxxd3394xxx  inhibition in both
native and recombinant ␤-cell katp channels (20,44,45).
diabetes, vol. 51, supplement 3, december 2002

 xxxd2202xxx  block of  xxxg1250xxx / xxxg19xxx  currents in inside-out
patches was also much greater in the presence of 100
␮mol/l mgadp (fig. 3c), and the concentration-inhibition
relation was best fit with a single-site model with an ic50 of
204 ⫾ 7 nmol/l (n ⫽ 5). this finding was consistent with
the idea that the difference in the maximal block mediated
via the high-affinity site in excised patch and whole-cell
recordings results from the presence of mgadp in the
intact cell.
mgadp has both stimulatory and inhibitory effects on
the  xxxg1253xxx , mediated by the sur and  xxxg1250xxx  subunits, respectively (8). it has previously been hypothesized
that the nucleotide produces an apparent enhancement of
sulfonylurea block of  xxxg1250xxx / xxxg19xxx  currents, because the
drug abolishes the stimulatory action of mgadp, while
leaving the inhibitory effect untouched (20). consequently,
the combined inhibitory effects of sulfonylurea and nucleotide result in an enhanced inhibition. if this idea is
correct, then  xxxd2202xxx  block of mutant katp channels that
show reduced nucleotide inhibition should be unaffected
by mgadp.
mutation of the arginine at position 50 of  xxxg1250xxx  to
glycine ( xxxg1250xxx -r50g) strongly reduces nucleotide block at
the inhibitory site on  xxxg1250xxx  (46). the extent of this
reduction can be quantified by examining the effect of adp
in the absence of mg2⫹, because, in mg-free solution, the
stimulatory effect of adp is abolished and the inhibitory
effect of adp is unmasked (20). as fig. 4a shows, when
tested in the absence of mg2⫹, adp potently blocked
 xxxg1250xxx / xxxg19xxx  currents, but blocked  xxxg1250xxx -r50g/ xxxg19xxx  currents much less effectively (⬍15%). as a result of this
reduction in nucleotide block, adp produced an enhanced
stimulation of  xxxg1250xxx -r50g/ xxxg19xxx  currents (compared with
control currents) when applied in the presence of mg2⫹.
in the absence of nucleotides, the extent of  xxxd2202xxx 
block of  xxxg1250xxx -r50g/ xxxg19xxx  was similar to that found for
the wild-type channel, whether measured in the presence
or absence of mg2⫹ (fig. 4b and c). thus the r50g
mutation did not interfere with the action of the drug.
however, although mgadp enhanced  xxxd2202xxx  block of
wild-type channels, this was not the case for  xxxg1250xxx -r50g/
 xxxg19xxx  channels; indeed, the currents were actually slightly
larger in the presence of the drug (fig. 4b). these data
support the idea that  xxxd2202xxx  reduces the stimulatory
action of mgadp on wild-type channels and unmasks the
inhibitory effect of the nucleotide. the fact that kir6.2r50g/ xxxg19xxx  currents are somewhat greater in the presence
of both drug and mgadp than in the presence of  xxxd2202xxx 
alone suggests that 10 ␮mol/l  xxxd2202xxx  markedly reduces,
but does not totally abolish, the stimulatory action of the
nucleotide. an alternative explanation is that mgadp
reduces the potency of  xxxd2202xxx  block, as 10 ␮mol/l
 xxxd2202xxx  would not then saturate the high-affinity site.
if  xxxd2202xxx  prevents the stimulatory action of mgadp,
and unmasks its inhibitory effect, then the combined block
by  xxxd2202xxx  and adp on wild-type channels should be
similar in the absence and presence of mg2⫹. this was in
fact observed (fig. 4b and c). when mg2⫹ was absent,
 xxxg1250xxx -r50g/ xxxg19xxx  currents were of similar amplitude in
the presence of  xxxd2202xxx  or  xxxd2202xxx  plus adp (fig. 4c).
this is presumably because adp did not cause substantial
block of the mutant channel. because mgatp is the

 xxxd2202xxx  plus 100 ␮mol/l adp ( ), or 10
␮mol/l  xxxd2202xxx  plus 100 ␮mol/l atp (p), in
the presence (b) or absence (c) of 2 mmol/l
mg2ⴙ. conductance (g) is expressed as a fraction of that in the absence of the drug and
nucleotide (gc). the number of patches is
given above each bar. the dashed line indicates the control conductance level.

predominant mg nucleotide in vivo, we also examined the
effect of  xxxd2202xxx  on mgatp activation.  xxxg1250xxx -r50g/
 xxxg19xxx  currents were activated by mgatp (fig. 4a), because the inhibitory effect of the nucleotide was impaired
by the r50g mutation (10). as with adp, the stimulatory
action of atp in the presence of mg2⫹ was abolished by
 xxxd2202xxx  (fig. 4b).
the potency of  xxxd2202xxx  block was significantly different when measured in the absence and presence of 100
␮mol/l mgadp in excised patches (ic50 of 50 and 204
nmol/l, respectively). it is therefore possible that mgadp
caused a small reduction in drug potency. this might also
explain why  xxxd2202xxx  was somewhat less potent in intact
oocytes (108 nmol/l). it also would be consistent with the
fact that  xxxd2202xxx  block of  xxxg1250xxx -r50g/ xxxg19xxx  currents is
less in the presence of mgadp than in its absence.
although the effects of mg nucleotides on  xxxd2202xxx  binding have not been investigated, it is known that [3h] xxxd2215xxx  binding to native ␤-cell katp channels is
decreased by mgadp (47). it is not clear whether  xxxd2202xxx  displaces mgadp from the nucleotide-binding domains of  xxxg19xxx , or if it uncouples mgadp binding from
channel activation. however,  xxxd2215xxx  has been
shown to cause unbinding of 8-azido-[32p]atp to nbd1 of
 xxxg19xxx  in the presence of mgadp (48), lending some
support to the former hypothesis.
transduction

binding of sulfonylureas to the cytoplasmic domains of
 xxxg19xxx  ultimately results in closure of the pore formed by
 xxxg1250xxx . precisely how this transduction occurs is unknown.
there must be a close physical association between the
 xxxd2215xxx  binding site on sur and the  xxxg1250xxx  subunit,
as both proteins can be photoaffinity labeled by [125i] xxxd2215xxx  (7). five residues within the first tm of  xxxg1250xxx 
are essential for interaction with sur (49), and recent
studies have indicated that the first five tms of  xxxg19xxx  are
also involved (50). however, although these regions are
required for structural interactions, it is not clear whether
they are also involved in functional coupling. mutagenesis
studies, however, have implicated the nh2-terminus of
s374

 xxxg1250xxx  and the cooh-terminus of  xxxg19xxx  in coupling sulfonylurea binding to channel inhibition (25,26).
conclusion and perspectives

sulfonylureas have been used for many years to treat type
2 diabetes, but it is only now that the details of their
molecular mechanism of action are beginning to be unraveled. as first proposed by henquin and colleagues (51),
antidiabetogenic sulfonylureas, benzamido compounds,
and their derivatives appear to interact with more than one
part of the  xxxg1253xxx . this suggests that, like other
atp-binding cassette transporters, sur possesses a large
multifaceted drug-binding pocket that can accommodate
several structurally distinct compounds. individual compounds differ in the residues within this pocket with which
they interact. studies of recombinant katp channels suggest that the sulfonylurea moiety interacts with residues in
the tm 15–16 linker of  xxxg19xxx , whereas benzamido derivatives may interact with the tm 5– 6 linker in the nh2terminal part of the protein. how these different parts of
the sulfonylurea receptor contribute to drug binding, and
how this is transduced into changes in channel activity,
remains far from clear and awaits determination of the
structure of sur, and its relation to  xxxg1250xxx , at atomic
resolution.
currently, sulfonylureas are classified as first- and
second-generation drugs, although there is no structural or
functional basis for this classification. we now know that
some sulfonylureas bind with high-affinity to  xxxg19xxx , but not
 xxxg20xxx , whereas others interact with both types of sur. we
therefore propose that the classification of sulfonylureas,
meglitinide derivatives, and structurally related compounds be changed to reflect the functional differences
among these drugs, and that they be referred to instead as
 xxxg19xxx -specific and non– xxxg19xxx -specific.
