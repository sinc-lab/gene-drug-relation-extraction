abstract
h-arrestin mediates desensitization and internalization of h-adrenergic receptors (hars), but also acts as a scaffold protein in
extracellular signal-regulated kinase (erk) cascade. thus, we have examined the role of h-arrestin2 in the har-mediated erk signaling
pathways.  xxxd2401xxx  stimulation equally activated cytoplasmic and nuclear erk in cos-7 cells expressing h1ar or h2ar. however, the
activity of nuclear erk was enhanced by co-expression of h-arrestin2 in h2ar—but not h1ar-expressing cells. pertussis toxin treatment
and blockade of ghg action inhibited h-arrestin2-enhanced nuclear activation of erk, suggesting that h-arrestin2 promotes nuclear erk
localization in a ghg dependent mechanism upon receptor stimulation. h2ar containing the carboxyl terminal region of h1ar lost the harrestin2-promoted nuclear translocation. as the carboxyl terminal region is important for h-arrestin binding, these results demonstrate that
recruitment of h-arrestin2 to carboxyl terminal region of h2ar is important for erk localization to the nucleus.

1. introduction
h1- and h2-adrenergic receptors (h1ar, h2ar) are
members of gpcrs co-expressing in many tissues receiving
sympathetic stimulation [1–3]. although both of h1 and
h2ars stimulate the adenylyl cyclase- xxxg1836xxx 
pathway via gs, many differences in functional properties
between h1ar and h2ar have been reported. for instance,
h2ar can activate cell survival signals, whereas h1ar elicit
apoptotic pathways in cardiomyocytes [4–6].

h-arrestin interacts with agonist-stimulated and phosphorylated gpcrs, and mediates receptor desensitization
and internalization. a number of studies have recently
revealed that h-arrestin plays important roles in the difference between h1ar- and h2ar-induced responses. we
have reported that h2ar has a higher affinity for h-arrestins
than h1ar, and the differential stability of receptor-harrestin complexes is a molecular basis of differential
internalization behavior of h1ar and h2ar [7]. thus,
h2ar is rapidly internalized by agonist stimulation, whereas
h1ar shows the resistance to agonist-induced internalization [7,8]. h-arrestin plays important roles not only in
internalization but also in desensitization and signaling. harrestin interacts with phosphorylated h2ar and inhibits the
coupling of receptors with gs [9] or accelerates the
degradation of camp by recruiting  xxxg1697xxx  to
receptor-h-arrestin complex [10]. h-arrestins also work as
scaffold proteins for jnk and erk activation cascade
besides their roles in desensitization of gpcrs [11,12].
although the affinity with h-arrestins is different between

h1 and h2ar, the difference in signaling pathways
modulated with h-arrestins is still unclear. thus, in the
present study, we examine whether the differential affinity
of h1 and h2ars for h-arrestin affects receptor-mediated
erk signaling pathways.

2.2. plasmid construction
chimeric receptors of h1- and h2ar were constructed
and ligated into ecori and bamhi sites of pcmv5 as
previously described [7]. the chimeric chh1/h2ar contains met1-ala348 of h1ar and ile298-leu413 of h2ar, and
the chimeric chh2/h1ar contains met1-val297 of h2ar and
phe349-val477 of h1ar.
2.3. cell culture and treatment
cos-7 cells were maintained in dulbecco’s modified
eagle’s medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine
serum at 37 8c in 5% co2. cells were plated on 60 mm
culture dishes at density of 8.0105 cells/dish at a day
before transfection. transient transfection was carried out
using lipofectamine and plus reagent according to
supplier’s instructions. expression level of h1 and
h2ars were 5.8 and 6.9 pmol/mg protein as determined
by [3h]-dihydroalprenolol.
2.4. western blot analysis
for  xxxg1369xxx /2 phosphorylation assays, cos-7 cells in 60
mm dishes were transfected with h1ar, h2ar, chh1/h2ar

1249

or chh2/h1ar (0.5 ag/dish) with or without h-arrestin2
(1.5 ag/dish). the transfected cells were incubated overnight in serum-free dmem supplemented with 10 ag/ml
 xxxd2193xxx  prior to stimulation. cells were stimulated 48 h after transfection by 100 nm  xxxd2401xxx  for 10
min, washed with phosphate-buffered saline. subcellular
fractionation of cos-7 cells was performed according to
tohgo et al. [13] with minor modifications. in brief, cells
were collected into 700 al of lysis buffer (10 mm tris-hcl,
ph7.4, 10 mm nacl, 3 mm mgcl2, 1 mm na3vo4, 1 mm
phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 ag/ml aprotinin and 10
ag/ml leupeptin) supplemented with 0.3% (v/v) nonidet p40, incubated on ice for 3 min to allow cells to cause lysis,
and centrifuged 1000g for 5 min. the supernatants were
used as the extranuclear fraction. the pellets containing
nucleus were washed with lysis buffer without nonidet p-40
twice and pelleted at 1000g. both extranuclear and
nuclear fractions were solubilized in laemmli sample
buffer, boiled for 5 min and separated on sds/12%
polyacryamide gel electrophoresis. for the measurement
of h-arrestin2 protein expression, cells were collected into
120 al of laemmli sample buffer, boiled for 5 min and 10 al
of aliquots were applied. proteins were transferred on to a
polyvinylidene difluoride membrane by semi-dry method.
the membrane was incubated with tris-buffered saline
containing tween 20 (20 mm tris-hcl, ph 7.4, 137 mm
nacl, and 0.2% tween 20) containing 5% nonfat milk.
phosphorylated erk protein was detected using a 1:1000
dilution of anti-phospho- xxxd1355xxx /42 erk antibody. the membrane was then probed with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit igg antibody and visualized using
enhanced chemiluminescence method. optical density of
the film was scanned and measured with scion image
software (scion).
2.5. confocal microscopy
cos-7 cells in 60 mm dishes were transfected with
h1ar or h2ar (0.5 ag/dish) and h-arrestin2 (1.5 ag/dish).
empty pegfp-n1 vector (100 ng/dish) was co-transfected
to determine transfection efficiency. cells were re-plated 24
h after transfection on gelatin-coated glass coverslips at a
density of 6.0103 cells/cm2 and serum-starved. cells were
stimulated 48 h after transfection with 100 nm of
 xxxd2401xxx  for 10 min. cells were then washed with
phosphate-buffered saline, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde
for 10 min, and permeabilized by methanol for 10min at
20 8c. immunolabeling was carried out using antiphospho- xxxd1355xxx /42 erk antibody in 1:200 dilution as a
primary antibody, and anti-rabbit igg antibody conjugated
with alexa fluor 647 as a secondary antibody. confocal
microscopy was performed on zeiss lsm510 laser scanning
microscope using plan-neofluar 20/0.5 lens with dual line
excitation of 488 nm (for gfp) and 633 nm (for alexa fluor
647), and emission (505–530 nm for gfp, and 639–800 nm
for alexa fluor 647) filter sets.

increased the cytoplasmic and nuclear erk phosphorylation by 1.6- and 1.4-fold, respectively (fig. 1a and
c). these results show that h1- and h2ars activate erk
to the same extent in cytoplasm and nucleus. to
determine the effect of h-arrestin2 on h1- and h2arinduced erk activation, we co-expressed h-arrestin2 and
determined the effect on the agonist-stimulated phosphorylation of erk. the expression level of h-arrestin2 was
similar in the h1- and h2ar-expressing cells. h1armediated erk phosphorylation was unchanged by coexpression of h-arrestin2. however, in h2ar-expresing
cells, the increase of phosphor-erk was 2.2 fold higher
in the presence of h-arrestin2, whereas there was no
significant effect on the activity of erk in the
cytoplasmic fraction. as in the resting state about 95%
of phosphorylated erk is localized in the cytoplasmic
fraction, the expression of h-arrestin2 did not change the
total amount of phospho-erk with or without  xxxd2401xxx  stimulation. accordingly, h-arrestin2 seemed to shift
the localization of phospho-erk from cytoplasm to
nucleus rather than increase the phosphorylation of
erk in cytoplasm. the localization of activated erk
was also monitored with confocal microscopy (fig. 2). in
cos-7 cells expressing h1- or h2ars along with harrestin2, the stimulation of cells by  xxxd2401xxx 
remarkably increased phosphorylated erk. the nuclear
localization of phosphorylated erk in h2ar-expressing
cells was more strongly promoted by h-arrestin2 expression compared with h1ar-expressing cells. this result
was consistent with the data of western blot analysis in
fig. 1.

3.2. signaling pathways of b1- and  xxxg92xxx -induced activation
and translocation of erk
in many cells, gi-coupled receptors including h2ar are
reported to activate erk via ghg, which is released from
gi, and  xxxg2198xxx . therefore, we examined the
effect of ptx and  xxxd1307xxx  on h2ar-stimulated erk
activation in the cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions. cos7 cells transiently expressing h2ars with or without harrestin2 were treated with 100 ng/ml ptx for 16 h or 1
am  xxxd1307xxx  for 1 h prior to the stimulation with  xxxd2401xxx .
when h2ar was expressed alone, ptx treatment did not
affect  xxxd2401xxx -induced phosphorylation of erk in
the cytoplasmic or nuclear fractions (fig. 3). however,
when h2ar was co-expressed with h-arrestin2, ptx
treatment completely inhibited the nuclear-selective
increase of erk induced by h-arrestin2. we observed
the similar expression level of h-arrestin2 among each
condition. these results suggest that the activation of erk

and stimulated 48 h after transfection with 100 nm  xxxd2401xxx  for 10
min. cells were fractionated into nucleus and cytoplasm as described, and
the activation of erk was determined by immunoblotting analysis using an

cytoplasmic (white column, left panel) or nuclear (shaded column, right

activation in the cytoplasmic (white column, left panel) or nuclear (shaded

by h2ar stimulation is mediated by the mechanism
independent of gi, wheras h-arrestin2-promoted erk
translocation to the nuclear fraction is dependent on
h2ar-gi coupling. on the other hand,  xxxd1307xxx  treatment
inhibited  xxxd2401xxx -induced erk activation in the
cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions (fig. 3). however,  xxxd1307xxx 
treatment did not inhibit h-arrestin2-promoted translocation of erk to the nucleus. these results suggest that the
translocation of erk to the nucleus by h-arrestin2 does
not require src activation. next, we examined the involvement of ghg in  xxxd2401xxx -stimulated erk activation in
the cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions.  xxxg970xxx -ct is known
to inhibit ghg-mediated signaling by sequestering ghg.
when  xxxg970xxx -ct was expressed in cells expressing h2ar
and h-arrestin2,  xxxg970xxx -ct did not inhibit erk activation
in the cytoplasmic fraction (fig. 4). however,  xxxg970xxx -ct
blocked the h-arrestin2-promoted nuclear erk activity.
the co-expression of  xxxg970xxx -ct did not affect the level of
h-arrestin2. as h-arrestin2-promoted nuclear erk activation is mediated by gi, these results suggest that ghg

1252

released from gi is involved in h-arrestin2-dependent
nuclear erk activation.
3.3. erk activation by chimeric b1/b2 receptors
to examine whether the interaction of h2ar with harrestin2 is important for the translocation of erk to the
nucleus, we have constructed h1/h2 chimeras that
carboxyl terminal regions of h1- or h2ars are replaced
with the corresponding regions of h2- or h1ars (fig.
5a). as shown in fig. 5b and c, stimulation of chh1/
h2ar, h1ar with seventh transmembrane domain and
carboxyl terminal region of h2ar, gained the ability to
increase erk activity in the nucleus. we observed that
the expression level of h-arrestin2 is similar between
chh2/h1ar- and chh1/h2ar-expressing cells (fig. 5b).
on the contrary, stimulation of chh2/h1ar, h2ar with
seventh transmembrane domain and carboxyl terminal
region of h1ar, lost the ability to increase erk
activation in the nucleus. as the cytoplasmic erk
activation was not significantly changed between chimeric
receptors and wild type hars, these results suggest that
carboxyl terminal regions of h1ar and h2ar determine
their ability to increase the h-arrestin2-dependent nuclear
erk activation.

4. discussion
a novel finding in the present study is that h-arrestin2
facilitates the translocation of erk in h2ar- but not
h1ar-expressing cells (fig. 1), and the carboxyl terminal
region of hars determines the localization of activated
erk. we have previously reported that h2ar has higher
affinity for h-arrestins than h1ar, and the carboxyl
terminal regions of hars are major determinant for high
affinity binding of h-arrestins [7]. the most of h-arrestin2
is known to be localized almost exclusively in the
cytoplasm under the steady state conditions in hek293
cells [21], and constitutively shuttled between cytoplasm
and nucleus by leptomycin b sensitive mechanisms [22].
we observed the nucleus-selective increase of erk but
could not detect the decrease of erk in the cytoplasmic
fraction. as in the resting state most of phosphorylated
erk is localized in the cytoplasmic fraction, it may be
difficult to detect the small decrease of phosphor-erk in
the cytoplasmic fraction that is assumed to translocate to
the nucleus upon  xxxd2401xxx  stimulation, even if the
 xxxd2401xxx -induced increase of phosphorylated erk in
the nucleus is significant. therefore, we speculate that harrestin2 interacts with h2ar and enhances nuclear translocation of phospho-erk.

expression levels from total cell lysates are also shown at lower panel. (c) summary of the  xxxd2401xxx -stimulated cytoplasmic or nuclear activation of erk
in cells expressing one of wild type or chimeric receptors with h-arrestin2. cos-7 cells were transiently transfected with wild type h1ar, wild type h2ar,
chh1/h2ar or chh2/h1ar with or without h-arrestin2, serum-starved overnight and stimulated 48 h after transfection with 100 nm  xxxd2401xxx  for 10 min.
cells were separated into cytoplasmic (white column) and nuclear (shaded column) fractions as described, and the phosphorylation of erk was determined by
immunoblotting analysis using an anti-phospho- xxxg1369xxx /2 antibody. the data are expressed as a percentage of the value obtained from cells stimulated with
 xxxd2401xxx  in the absence of h-arrestin2. the data represent the meanfs.e. of five independent experiments, *pb0.05.

h. kobayashi et al. / cellular signalling 17 (2005) 1248–1253

we have also found that the translocation of phosphoerk to the nucleus was inhibited by ptx treatment and
sequestration of ghg (figs. 3 and 4). the interaction of harrestins with hars requires phosphorylation of carboxyl
terminal region of the receptors by grks [23,24], and ghg
is necessary for membrane translocation of  xxxg970xxx  and
 xxxg971xxx  [25]. cos-7 cells expresses low but sufficient level
of  xxxg970xxx  to mediate desensitization through h-arrestin
binding [26]. therefore, h2ar-gi-ghg pathway may serve
to facilitate the nuclear translocation of phospho-erk by
activating grk-dependent receptor phosphorylation.
generally, there are two signaling pathways leading to
erk activation from har. in hek293 cells [14,15] and
s49 lymphoma cells [16], erk is activated by gs-dependent and ptx-insensitive pathways that is mediated by small
g protein rap1 and  xxxg2198xxx . on the other hand,
the activation of erk by h2ar is mediated by gi in
hek293 [17], cos-7 [18], and cho cells [19], through the
ghg-mediated activation of  xxxg2198xxx . we have
found in the present study that the activation of erk by h1and h2ars in cos-7 cells was ptx-insensitive and srcdependent (fig. 3), suggesting that gs pathway mediates
erk activation. our results do not agree with the report by
maudsley et al., who demonstrated that the h2ar-mediated
activation of erk in cos-7 cells is mediated by gi [18]. as
the sensitivity of erk activation to ptx is different in
isolates of the same hek293 cells [14,15,17,20], the
difference in erk signaling pathway in cos-7 cells may
be explained by the difference between isolates, such as
expression level of signaling molecules. however, the
present study suggests that the role of h-arrestins is
translocating erk to the nucleus, rather than activating
cytoplasmic erk. thus, h-arrestins may act to facilitate the
nuclear erk activity even in cells having different erkactivating mechanisms.
tohgo et al. reported that gpcrs such as at1a receptor
and vasopressin  xxxg231xxx  bind h-arrestin with high
affinity, and inhibit function of h-arrestin-bound erk in
nucleus [13,27]. they suggest that gpcrs forming stable
complex with h-arrestin may inhibit erk activity in
nucleus. however, the affinity between h2ar and h-arrestin
is lower than at1a and vasopressin v2 receptors, and the
interaction between h2ar and h-arrestin is transient.
replacement of carboxyl terminal region of vasopressin
 xxxg231xxx  with the corresponding region of h2ar
increases the translocation of erk to nucleus and transcription of elk-1 reporter gene [27]. therefore, the
dissociation of h-arrestin from gpcr complex may be
required for the h-arrestin-promoted translocation of phosphor-erk to nucleus.
in conclusion, the present results indicate the nuclear
translocation mechanism of phospho-erk that is mediated
by h-arrestin2. this mechanism contributes to the differential subcellular localization of erk and may be a
molecular basis for different physiological responses
induced by various har subtypes.
