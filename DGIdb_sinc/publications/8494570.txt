inhibitory effect of  xxxd3564xxx  on human carbonic anhydrase in vitro.  we examined the relative potencies of  xxxd3564xxx  (cas  xxxd3564xxx ) to acetazolamide in inhibiting carbonic anhydrases in human erythrocytes and purified human  xxxg287xxx  and ii in vitro and found them to be about 1/150, 1/8 and 1/188, respectively. the ic50 values of  xxxd3564xxx  and acetazolamide for the inhibition of erythrocyte enzymes were close to those of purified  xxxg293xxx . this result indicates that  xxxd3564xxx  actually differs from acetazolamide in their actions on the physiological events which are coupled with co2 hydration in vivo.
