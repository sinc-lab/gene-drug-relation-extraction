type-i plasminogen activator inhibitor (pai-1) is the primary inhibitor of both tissue- and
urokinase-type plasminogen activators ( xxxg1766xxx ,  xxxg1767xxx ) and is thus a primary regulator of plasminogen activation and possibly of extracellular proteolysis. in anchorage-dependent cells, the
pai-1 gene was regulated by cell adhesion. pai-1 gene expression was induced more evidently
in cells adhered to the culture plate than in nonadherent cells. in this study, we investigated the
signal pathway of the pai-1 gene expression regulated by cell adhesion. we found the induction
of both pai-1 mrna and protein, when cells adhered to culture dish, was inhibited by the  xxxg1743xxx 
kinase specific inhibitors ( xxxd2523xxx  and  xxxd3536xxx ). the cells seeded on collagen-1 coated
plate with low serum further demonstrated that the pai-1 gene expression was prolonged by
the cell adhesion. the above-mentioned  xxxg1743xxx  kinase specific inhibitors also blocked the pai-1
maintenance when cell adhered to collagen-1 coated plate. in addition, we found that both
 xxxg1743xxx  kinase and its downstream molecule, akt, were activated more evidently in adherent cells
than in nonadherent cells. furthermore, we transfected antisense oligodeoxynucleotides of akt
(as-odn-akt) into cells to block the expression of akt and found that the induction of pai-1
mrna was also inhibited. hence, we conclude that the induction of pai-1 gene expression is
cell adhesion dependent and is through  xxxg1743xxx  kinase and akt activation.

matrix (ecm). first, pai-1 is a specific serpin inhibitor that binds and inhibits the activity of receptorbound upa. pai-1 inhibition also shortens upa halflife by inducing its internalization and degradation
(4), processes requiring two receptors. in addition to
upa receptor ( xxxg1768xxx ), the  xxxg831xxx -macroglobulin receptor [low-density lipoprotein (ldl)-receptor-related
protein (lrp)] is required. the quaternary uparupa-pai-1-lrp complex is initially internalized.

type-i plasminogen activator inhibitor (pai-1) is
the primary inhibitor of both tissue- and urokinasetype plasminogen activators ( xxxg1766xxx ,  xxxg1767xxx ), and is thus
a primary regulator of plasminogen activation and
possibly of extracellular proteolysis (17, 21, 23). at

then, after the upa-pai-1 is delivered to the lysosome, the free  xxxg1768xxx  is recycled back to the cell
surface at the focal contacts (3, 19). second, pai-1
binds to the n-terminal somatomedin-like domain
of  xxxg2422xxx  (vn), which lies close to the rgd
sequence mediating vn-integrin interaction. thus,
pai-1 prevents integrin’s association with vn and
hence cells adhesion and migration on this substrate
in vitro (11, 24). pai-1 also competes with the upa
receptor ( xxxg1768xxx ) to bind to the same region of vn and
hence inhibits upa-dependent cell adhesion and migration (6, 10). thus, in addition to its serpin activity, competition with vn for integrins and  xxxg1768xxx  accounts for the antiadhesive and antimigratory properties of pai-1. eventually, the pai-1 seems to play
not only a role in inhibiting plasminogen activation,
but also more roles in the regulation of the interaction between cells and ecm.
cell adhesion to the extracellular matrix (ecm)
generates intracellular signals that modulate cell
proliferation, survival, and differentiation (8, 22).
recent results suggest that pai-1 transcript levels,
similar to those encoding components of the adhesive complex (i.e., vinculin,  xxxg836xxx -integrin, fibronectin,
actin, and upa), may be growth-state-dependent.
pai-1 expression is also enhanced or maintained by
cell adhesive influence (20). in our previous study,
we investigated the complete picture of how the
pai-1 gene was expressed when cells adhered to a
culture plate. we found that in anchorage-dependent
cells, the pai-1 gene was up-regulated when cells
were beginning to attach to a culture dish and was
down-regulated when cells had attached completely.
the pai-1 gene expression was induced only in cells
adhered to culture plate but not in nonadhered cells.
our experiment also indicates that both  xxxg2422xxx 
and fibronectin, as components of ecm, and pai-1
itself may be the factors involved in the regulation
of pai-1 gene expression (14).
in this study, we further investigated the signal
pathway of the pai-1 gene expression as regulated
by cell adhesion and demonstrated that the pai-1
gene expression is induced by cell adhesion through
the activation of  xxxg1743xxx  kinase and akt activation.

results
more evident and prolonged pai-1 induction
in adherent cell
from our previous report (14), we found that in
anchorage-dependent cells, the pai-1 gene was regulated by cell adhesion. in order to reconfirm our
previous finding that pai-1 gene expression was induced more evidently in cells adhered to the culture
plate than in nonadherent cells, we repeated the experiments by northern blot and elisa. the nasal
pharyngeal carcinoma (npc) cell line, npc-tw01,
was used to stand for anchorage-dependent cell.
from northern blot assay (figure 1a), in the cells
seeded on bacterial culture plate (nonadhesion), we
found that the pai-1 gene was only slightly induced
2 to 4 h after the cells seeded, then down-regulated.
but in the cells seeded on tissue culture plate (adhesion), the pai-1 gene expression was more evidently induced 2 to 16 h after the cells seeded and
continued expressing until 24 h after. from elisa
assay (figure 1b), the pai-1 protein was evenly induced in both adherent and nonadherent cells before
8 h of cells seeding. afterwards, the pai-1 protein
was down-regulated in nonadherent cells, but was
up-regulated about five times more than control in
adherent cells 16 to 24 h after the cells seeded.

adhesion and nonadhesion were biostatistically significant by t-test,

 xxxg1743xxx  kinase is involved in the pai-1 induction
from cell adhesion
from the above results that support our previous finding (14), we tried to investigate what signals were involved in the pai-1 gene induction after
cell adhesion. we first used a phosphatidylinositol
3-kinase ( xxxg1743xxx  kinase) inhibitor,  xxxd2523xxx , to treat
npc-tw01 cells when cells seeded. from northern
blot assay, we found that the induction of pai-1 gene
expression by cell adhesion was inhibited by 50 µm
of  xxxd2523xxx  (figure 2a). we also treated npc cells
with another  xxxg1743xxx  kinase inhibitor,  xxxd3536xxx , and
found that  xxxd3536xxx  (50 nm) could also inhibit

from elisa assay, in cell extract, we found that the
pai-1 protein could not be induced by cell adhesion when  xxxd2523xxx  or  xxxd3536xxx  were added in
(figure 3a). in the cultured medium,  xxxg1743xxx  kinase inhibitors also inhibited the induction of pai-1 protein
concentration when cells adhered (figure 3b). these
results suggest that the  xxxg1743xxx  kinase activation may be
involved in the induction of pai-1 gene expression
when cells adhered to the culture dish.

the cells were more apparently attached and spreading on the collagen-1 coated plate than on the control (noncoated tissue culture plate) (figure 4a). the
pai-1 gene was expressed more in the cells cultured on the collagen-1 plate than on the noncoated

is involved in the maintenance of pai-1 when cell
adhere.

 xxxg1743xxx  kinase and akt are activated
from cell adhesion
to explore if the  xxxg1743xxx  kinase pathway might be
activated when cells adhered to culture dish, we
investigated the downstream molecular of  xxxg1743xxx  kinase, akt, which might be phosphorylated after  xxxg1743xxx 

kinase activation. from western blot assay, we used
the monoclonal antibody that specifically recognizes
phospho-akt (ser 473) to detect the phospho-akt
(ser 473) level. four hours after the cells were
seeded, we found the highest level of phospho-akt
(ser 473) in adherent cells. the concentration returned to the basal level after 8 h. the quantity of
phospho-akt in nonadherent cells was only slightly
induced at 4 h after the cell seeded but was much
less than in adherent cells (figure 5a). the result
was supported by the other western blot assay that
used polyclonal antibody of akt to detect total akt
protein. even though, we saw no significant change
of total akt in each lane, however, the density of the
band with higher molecular weight, which may be
considered as phospho-akt, was found to be parallel
correlated to the result of phospho-akt (ser 473).
furthermore, we continued to investigate whether
the kinase activity of akt would be elevated while the
cells were adhered. we first immuno-precipitated the
cell lysate with immobilized akt antibody, then did

the kinase reaction with its downstream substrate,
gsk-3alpha/beta. finally, phosphorylation of gsk-3alpha/beta
was measured by western blot using a phosphogsk-3alpha/beta (ser21/9) antibody. from the result in
figure 5b, we found that in adherent cells, akt activity peaks at 4 h after cell seeding, and that the
quantity of phospho- gsk-3alpha/beta in adherent cells
was more than that of nonadherent cells at every
period.

akt is also involved in the pai-1 induction
from cell adhesion
in order to prove that activation of akt is involved in the induction of pai-1 when cells adhered to culture dish, we transfected antisense
oligodeoxynucleotides of akt (as-odn-akt) or
sense oligodeoxynucleotides of akt (s-odn-akt)
into npc cells when the cells were adhering. after 16 h of cells attachment, we found the total akt
protein was decreased more in cells transfected with
as-odn-akt than in cells transfected with s-odnakt or in control cells (figure 6a). from northern
blot assay, we found the pai-1 mrna expression followed the same tendency as the akt protein expression. the less akt protein expressed in cells transfected with as-odn-akt, the less pai-1 mrna
were expressed (figure 6b).

from the previous report, induced pai-1 gene expression found in nrk (normal rat kidney) cells
occurred as part of the immediate-early response to
serum (20). pai-1 transcript accumulation peaked in
mid-g1 phase (approx. 4–6 h poststimulation) and
declined prior to the onset of dna synthetic phase.
however, in newly adherent cells, pai-1 transcript
accumulated at 4 and 8 h poststimulation. the amplitude of induction and maintenance of expression
in later stages of g1 were subject to adhesive influences. this indicates that both immediate-early
and secondary mechanisms regulate pai-1 mrna
levels during progression in adhesion of nrk cells.
from our finding, the pai-1 mrna was also found
induced in serum containing medium in nonadherent cells within 2 to 4 h of cells seeding. however,
in adherent cells, the induction of pai-1 was elongated and amplified up to 16 h. we further treated
cells that seeded on collagen-1 coated plate with low
serum and found the more expression of pai-1 than
on noncoated plate was due to the prolong of the
pai-1 gene expression. these results support our
previous finding (20) and suggest that there may

consist two mechanisms that induce pai-1 expression in newly adherent cells. the primary factor is
serum that induces pai-1 gene expression when cell
seed in serum containing medium. the secondary
factor comes from signals that were evoked from
cell adhesion. the  xxxg1743xxx  kinase and akt signals are
here proved to be correlated to the maintenance of
pai-1 gene expression by cell adhesion.
many different factors induce synthesis of pai-1.
the signal pathways that are involved in the induction of pai-1 gene by these factors also have
been investigated. for instance, phorbol esters activate pai-1 synthesis through pkc beta and mapk
p42 (16).  xxxg2269xxx  induced pai-1 gene expression requires mek activity (13). activation of mek/erk
and rho-kinase pathways plays a pivotal role in
pai-1 gene up-regulation by  xxxg99xxx  (12, 25).
inhibition of p38 mapk and  xxxg1743xxx  kinase significantly decreases thrombin-induced  xxxg1048xxx , pai-1,
and vegf expression (9). the biosynthesis of pai-1
evoked by insulin-receptor binding is due to  xxxg1743xxx  kinase activation, followed by protein kinase c, and
ultimately by mapk activation and erk phosphorylation (2). in our results, we focused on the pai-1
gene induced by cell adhesion and found that the  xxxg1743xxx 
kinase and akt kinase activations were involved in
the cell adhesion. we found that the pai-1 gene induction was interfered by its specific inhibitors such
as  xxxd3536xxx ,  xxxd2523xxx  and as-odn-akt. the
results, which reveal that a majority of pai-1 gene
or protein was blocked by these inhibitors, suggest
that the  xxxg1743xxx  kinase/akt pathway plays a major role in
the induction of pai-1 gene by cell adhesion. other
signal pathways such as mapk and pkc may be
involved in the induction of pai-1 gene by cell adhesion but are yet to be investigated. interactions
of cells with the extracellular environment regulate
many basic cellular functions, including differentiation, migration, cell growth, and programmed cell
death (apoptosis). many such signals from the ecm,
including those required for cell survival, are relayed
to the intracellular signaling machinery by integrins
(8). the three primary integrin signaling molecules
that have been linked to cell survival are fak (focal adhesion kinase), shc, and ilk (integrin-linked

kinase) (1, 5, 8). each of these proteins may impinge upon the pi-3k/akt pathway, although recent
evidence shows that they can also signal by distinct
mechanism. from our results, the pai-1 expression
directly linked to cell adhesion with  xxxg1743xxx  k/akt may
be correlated with enhancement of cell survival ability. hence, we have done many experiments to prove
if the elevated pai-1 protein concentration will prevent anoikis (apoptosis triggered by inadequate or inappropriate cell-matrix contacts) (7). however, there
was no correlation between the pai-1 protein concentration and the number of cells escaping from
anoikis (data was not shown). hence, we suggest
that pai-1 may play a role as a regulator of ecm
homeostasis and cell motility. since cell adhesion
triggers signals from the association between ecm
and integrins, the signals simultaneously trigger the
cells to enter pregrowth state and to mediate temporal changes in the expression and focalization of
pai-1, thereby influencing cell migration by barrier
proteolysis and ecm adhesion modulation.
