abstract
background: hepatic adverse events associated with
the use of nonaspirin drugs and nsaids are uncommon, but the widespread use of these drugs may impact public health.
objective: we conducted a case/noncase analysis of
spontaneous reports to compare the hepatic safety
profile of cyclooxygenase (cox)-2 selective inhibitors
with that of nonselective nsaids.
methods: this case/noncase analysis was conducted using the us food and drug administration
freedom of information (fda/foi) database (through
quarter 1, 2003) and the world health organization
uppsala monitoring centre (who/umc) database
(through quarter 3, 2003). council for international
organizations of medical sciences and w h o adverse
reaction terminology preferred terms were used to
classify hepatic disorders with broad and specific case
definitions. after reports involving established hepatotoxic drugs ( xxxd370xxx ,  xxxd2727xxx ,  xxxd3259xxx ) were
excluded, the proportion of reports (prs) of each case
definition was calculated for each nsaid. crude and
adjusted reporting odds ratios (rors) were used to
compare the overall proportions of hepatic disorders
and hepatic failure of celecoxib and rofecoxib versus
nonselective nsaids.
results: a total of 158,539 and 185,253 reports of
nsaids were identified in the fda/foi and who/
umc databases and 25% and 16%, respectively, involved other hepatotoxic drugs. the prs of hepatic
disorders for all cox-2 selective inhibitors and nonselective nsaids were 3.0% in the fda/foi database
and 2.7% in the who/umc database. in the fda/
foi and who/umc databases, respectively,  xxxd2727xxx  (16.7% and 14.4%),  xxxd370xxx  (12.0% and
20.7%), diclofenac (8.1% and 4.7%), and  xxxd3259xxx 
(6.1% and 9.9%) were reported to be associated with
higher proportions of overall hepatic disorders cornaugust 2006

pared with those of other nsaids. crude and adjusted rors for the prevalences of overall hepatic disorders and hepatic failure with celecoxib and rofecoxib
versus the other nsaids were <1 (indicating that the
proportion was not higher than that of the comparator) in both databases. the interpretation of the results was unchanged when  xxxd370xxx ,  xxxd2727xxx , and
 xxxd3259xxx  were excluded from the analysis.
conclusions: in this case/noncase analysis,  xxxd370xxx ,  xxxd2727xxx ,  xxxd3259xxx , and diclofenac had higher
proportions of reports of hepatic disorders compared
with those of other nsaids in the fda/foi and
who/umc databases. the analysis did not raise a
safety concern for celecoxib or rofecoxib versus nsaids
for overall hepatic disorders and hepatic failure. (clin

introduction
hepatic adverse events associated with the use of
nonaspirin drugs and nsaids are uncommon, but the
widespread use of these drugs may impact public
health. epidemiologic studies have reported the incidence of acute liver injury to be 1 to 9 cases per
100,000 users of nsaids. 1-3 however, this risk may
increase with the concurrent use of other hepatotoxic
medications. different types of hepatic disorders have
been reported with the use of practically all nsaids. 4q°

clinical therapeutics
liver test results returning to normal on cessation of
treatment, hepatic injury is one of the leading causes
of withdrawal of drugs from the market.  xxxd370xxx 
was removed from the us market in 1998, after i year
on the market, when several cases of liver failure were
associated with use of the drug. 4,5 during recent years,
 xxxd2727xxx  was withdrawn in various countries (eg,
finland, israel, portugal, spain) after spontaneous reporting suggested an increased risk for liver injury. 6-9
in addition,  xxxd3259xxx  has been associated with serious
liver injury in several series of cases, 1° and epidemiologic studies have found it to be associated with a
higher risk for acute liver injury compared with other
nsaids.1,11,12
a review of 14 controlled studies of patients with
arthritis showed that the overall incidence of hepatic
adverse events in patients receiving celecoxib was similar to that for placebo but lower than that for nsaids. 13
however, both celecoxib and rofecoxib have been associated with liver disorders through spontaneous reporting during the postmarketing period. 14-17
case/noncase analysis of spontaneous reports from
international public data sources can be used as an
early postmarketing activity to monitor the tolerability of drugs in the general population, ls-21 we used
this method to compare the hepatic tolerability of
cyclooxygenase (cox)-2 selective inhibitors with that
of nonselective nsaids.
materials and methods

we conducted a case/noncase disproportionality study
of spontaneous reports 2°-22 of hepatic disorders in
patients treated with cox-2 selective inhibitors and
nonselective nsaids in 2 public data sources of spontaneous reports of adverse drug reactions (adrs).
in this case/noncase analysis, case was defined as a
reported event of the outcome of interest, and all the
other reports were considered noncases (controls). the
distribution of the exposure of the drugs of interest is
compared among cases and noncases using measures
of disproportionality. 2°
d a t a sources

us food and drug administration freedom of
information database
the adverse events reporting system (aers), previously the spontaneous reporting system (srs), 23 is
a computerized information database designed to support the us food and drug administration's (fda's)
1124

postmarketing safety surveillance program for all approved drug and therapeutic biologic products. 24 since
1968, the fda has required that drug manufacturers
report adrs during clinical development. also, health
care professionals and consumers send the fda reports voluntarily through the medwatch program. 25
the structure of the database is in compliance with
international conference on harmonisation guidance
for industry on case safety reports. 26 all reported
adverse-event terms were coded using the medical
dictionary for regulatory activities (meddra). 27
the fda freedom of information (fda/foi) data
source 2s contains public information on selected fields
from srs/aers. new reports are added quarterly.
this study is based on the foi data updated to the
end of quarter 1 of 2003. the srs/aers combined
data source was analyzed with software interface
qscan version 2.1 (qed solutions inc., mclean,
virginia).

world health organization/uppsala monitoring
centre database
since 1968, the uppsala monitoring centre (umc),
sweden, has collected reports of adrs from the
78 countries of the world health organization (who)
collaborating program for international drug
monitoring. the database contains >3.5 million spontaneous reports. 29 new reports are added quarterly.
all adrs listed in the who/umc safety data source
are based on w h o adverse reaction terminology
(who-art) preferred terms. the who-art dictionary was developed and is maintained by the who/
umc. 3° this study is based on the w h o data up to
the end of quarter 3 of 2003. this information does
not represent the opinion of who. the who/umc
data source was analyzed using qscan 2.1.
case definition
the fda/foi data were analyzed using several case
definitions from the draft proposal of the council for
international organizations of medical sciences
(cioms) on standardized search queries based on
meddra. 31 we selected preferred terms to build both
broad and specific case definitions (appendix). specific
case definitions considered were abnormal hepatic

function, hepatic failure, hepatitis, hepatocellular
damage, and jaundice. a broad definition of overall
hepatic disorders included any of the specific conditions. a similar approach was used to build case deftvolume 28 number 8

nitions in the who/umc data source. cases might
be reported more than once for any agent.

drugs of exposure
we selected the following: cox-2 selective inhibitors
(celecoxib and rofecoxib), preferential cox-2 inhibitors ( xxxd2727xxx ), indole acetic acid derivatives (indomethacin and  xxxd3259xxx ), phenylacetic acid derivatives
(diclofenac and  xxxd370xxx ),  xxxd3029xxx  derivatives (naproxen and ibuprofen), oxicams ( xxxd2969xxx 
and  xxxd2561xxx ), and acetic acid derivatives ( xxxd2065xxx 
and ketorolac). we also built an independent category, multiple nsaids, for reports in which >1 cox-2
selective inhibitor and/or nonselective nsaid was
concomitantly reported.
a list of established hepatotoxic drugs was developed) 2 the medications included were allopurinol,
amiodarone, amoxicillin, ampicillin,  xxxd390xxx , captopril, carbamazepine, cephalexin, chlorpromazine, cimetidine, cloxacillin, cyclophosphamide, dextropropoxyphene, erythromycin, estrogens,  xxxd2082xxx ,  xxxd2090xxx ,
floxacillin, halothane, isoniazid, levodopa, methyldopa, methotrexate, minocycline,  xxxd2740xxx , omeprazole, oxytetracycline, paracetamol/acetaminophen,
 xxxd2870xxx ,  xxxd2908xxx , phenytoin, propoxyphene, ranitidine,  xxxd3255xxx , sulfonamides,  xxxd3394xxx , trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, troglitazone,
and  xxxd3485xxx .

measures of disproportional reporting
for each drug of interest, we calculated the proportion
of reports (prs) by dividing the number of reports for a
case definition by the total number of reports for the
drug. reports that included concomitance of any established hepatotoxic drug were excluded from this analysis.
in addition, we estimated crude and adjusted reporting odds ratios (rors) of hepatic disorders and
hepatic failure, comparing celecoxib and rofecoxib with
nonselective nsaids. for any outcome of interest, an
ror <1 meant that the proportion was not higher
than that of the comparator. 33 rors adjusted for age,
sex, and use of hepatotoxic drugs were estimated
using multiple logistic regression (adjustment 1). we
conducted a sensitivity analysis, excluding all reports
associated with the hepatotoxic nsaids  xxxd370xxx ,
 xxxd2727xxx , and  xxxd3259xxx  (adjustment 2). all analyses
were conducted using sas version 8.0 (sas institute
inc., cary, north carolina) and stata version 7.0
(statacorp lp, college station, texas).

res u lts
a total of 158,539 spontaneous reports of nsaids
were identified in the fda/foi data source. of these,
64% were from women. we excluded reports including
concomitant use of other hepatotoxic drugs--39,718
(25%) of the total reports. the prs of  xxxd2727xxx  and
celecoxib used concomitantly with other hepatotoxic
drugs were higher compared with other nsmds (46.8 %
and 35.0%, respectively, vs <31.0%), and the prs of
rofecoxib and celecoxib use by patients aged >65 years
was higher compared with other nsaids (38.4% and
35.3%, respectively, vs <34.0%) (table i).
the who/umc data source included a total of
185,253 reports of nsmds. approximately 64% were
for women, and we excluded 28,806 (16%) reports
that mentioned concomitant use of other hepatotoxic
drugs. the prs of concomitance with other hepatotoxic drugs were higher with ketorolac and ibuprofen
compared with all other drugs.
after reports involving the concomitant use of
other hepatotoxic drugs were excluded, the prs of
nsaids associated with hepatic disorders were 3.0%
(3594/118,821) in the fda/foi data source and 2.7%
(4297/156,447) in the who/umc data source.
the prs for the hepatic disorders in the fda/foi
data source are shown in table ii. the prs of overall
hepatic disorders were higher with  xxxd2727xxx  (16.7%),
 xxxd370xxx  (12.0%), diclofenac (8.1%), and  xxxd3259xxx 
(6.1%) compared with those of other nsaids. the
same was true for each specific hepatic disorder. the
prs in the who/umc data source were similar to
those of the fda/foi data source (table iii). the prs
of overall hepatic disorders were higher with  xxxd370xxx  (20.7%),  xxxd2727xxx  (14.4%), and  xxxd3259xxx 
(9.9%) compared with those of other nsaids. the
pr of overall hepatic disorders for diclofenac was
4.7%. the prs of overall hepatic disorders were similar or higher with naproxen and ketorolac in the
fda/foi data source and ketorolac and  xxxd2561xxx  in
the who/umc data source compared with those of
other nsaids. prs of hepatic failure were lower with
naproxen, ibuprofen, and cox-2 selective inhibitors
in the fda/foi data source and  xxxd2561xxx , indomethacin, and naproxen in the who/umc data source
compared with those of other nsmds (figures i and 2).
crude analysis of rors comparing the prs of
nsaids with and without the concomitant use of
other hepatotoxic drugs showed values of 1.25 (95%
ci, 1.17-1.34) in the fda/foi data source, and 1.18

crude rors for age and sex differed between data
sources. the ror for overall hepatic disorders in
patients aged >65 years, compared with those aged
<65 years, was not increased in the fda/foi data source
(ror 0.98; 95% ci, 0.92-1.03), but was moderately
increased in the who/umc data source (ror 1.47;
95% ci, 1.39-1.55). regarding sex, rors for women
compared with men were 1.17 (95% ci, 1.11-1.25)
and 0.99 (95% ci, 0.93-1.05), in the fda/foi and
who/umc data sources, respectively.
crude and adjusted rors for overall hepatic disorders and hepatic failure comparing celecoxib and
rofecoxib with nonselective nsaids are presented in
table iv. both crude and adjusted rors (adjustment 1)
were <1 for celecoxib and rofecoxib in both data
sources. when  xxxd370xxx ,  xxxd2727xxx , and  xxxd3259xxx 
were removed from the analysis (adjustment 2), all
rors remained <1.
discussion
based on a disproportionality analysis conducted in
the fda/foi and who/umc spontaneous reporting
data sources, this study did not raise concerns about
august 2006

the overall and specific hepatic profiles of celecoxib
and rofecoxib compared with nonselective nsaids.
adjustment of rors by age and sex, and further
exclusion of reports with  xxxd370xxx ,  xxxd2727xxx , and
 xxxd3259xxx , did not modify these results. in addition, to
further diminish the potential confounding effect of
factors associated with spontaneous reporting of
hepatic disorders, we restricted the analysis to those
reports that did not include the concomitant use of
other established hepatotoxic drugs.
the pr analysis of individual nsaids did not find
differences in the profile of hepatic reports with celecoxib and rofecoxib versus that of ibuprofen and naproxen across different case definitions in either data
source. the prs of the 2 cox-2 inhibitors were consistently lower than those of  xxxd370xxx ,  xxxd2727xxx ,
 xxxd3259xxx , and diclofenac. the latter findings are consistent with results from previous epidemiologic studies. 4-12 the incidence of acute liver injury in the
general population has been estimated at -4 cases per
100,000 person-years. 3 the incidence among current
users of nsaids is -9 cases per 100,000 person-years,
which translates to a 2-fold risk increase and -5 extra
cases per 100,000 users of nsaids per year. 3 to date,

epidemiologic studies have not shown major risk differences among individual nsaids except for  xxxd3259xxx , with risk estimates considerably higher than those
of other nsaids. 34 however, 1 epidemiologic study,
by de abajo et al, 35 assessed the risk for acute liver
injury in >1.6 million subjects aged 5 to 75 years in
the uk-based general practice research database
(1994-1999) and found that the crude incidence rate
of drug-induced liver injury was estimated as 2.4 per
100,000 person-years (95% ci, 2.0-2.8). diclofenac
was associated with a 4-fold increase compared with
nonuse of nsaids. this estimate was based on a total
of 10 cases of exposure to diclofenac. the functional
injury patterns were cholestatic in 4 patients, hepatocellular in 2, mixed in 3, and undetermined in 1.
in general, the different results from disproportionality analysis for the fda/foi and who/umc data
sources could be explained by the different case definitions built for each data source. in the fda/foi data
source, we used the definitions from the last available
report of the cioms standardized search queries for
11 28

meddra preferred terms. 31 for the who/umc analysis, we adapted who-art preferred terms to build case
definitions similar to those established in the fda/foi
data source.
study limitations and future direction

limitations of analyses of spontaneous reports have
been widely described. 36~2 there are discrepancies
and variations in the approaches used to report, identify, define, and classify cases of hepatic disorders, as
well as in the processes for evaluating and determining
causality.36-3s underreporting is an important limitation of the analysis of spontaneous reports. sgro et ap 9
found that the annual incidence rate of drug-induced
hepatic injury was 16-fold greater than the rate from
spontaneous reporting. other factors, such as the weber
effect (temporal pattern of adverse-event reports, increasing after launch and decreasing with time from
launch), channeling effect (a type of allocation bias in

clinical therapeutics

ferences), physician awareness, time since launch, and
media influence, have been described as modifiers of
spontaneous reporting. 37 in addition, the reporting of
some specific events associated with a drug might dilute the proportion of reports of other events reported
with this same drug, thus limiting the value of the
comparisons. the results must be interpreted with caution given the limitations inherent to these analyses.
the value of disproportionality analysis of spontaneous reports is debatable. 4°-43 in our analysis, we estimated rors using adjustment techniques in an
attempt to control for confounding factors. 18,21 although some authors have argued the limited value of
disproportionality analysis from an epidemiologic
perspective, 4°,41 others consider the ror as a mathematic approximation to relative risk. 21,42
during the past 30 years, hepatotoxicity has been a
cause of treatment discontinuation. 44 most cases have
occurred after a signal was detected in the analysis of
spontaneous reports of adrs. 44 spontaneous reports
are based on the judgment of health care practitioners,
and despite the limitations of the reports (case confirmation, causality assessment), they have led to treatment discontinuation. 44 the value of the analysis of
spontaneous reports is the early detection of potential
safety signals associated with new drugs. further clinical trials and/or well-designed epidemiologic studies are
necessary to estimate risks.
conclusions

in this case/noncase analysis,  xxxd370xxx ,  xxxd2727xxx ,
 xxxd3259xxx , and diclofenac had higher proportions of reports of hepatic disorders compared with those of other
nsaids in the fda/foi and who/umc databases.
the analysis did not raise a safety concern for celecoxib or rofecoxib versus nsaids for overall hepatic disorders and hepatic failure.
