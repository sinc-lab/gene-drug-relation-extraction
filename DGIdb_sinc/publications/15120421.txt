abstract
in determining the biological profiles of various antiprogestins, it is important to assess the hormonal and antihormonal activity, selectivity, and potency of their proximal metabolites. the early metabolism of mifepristone is characterized by rapid demethylation and
hydroxylation. similar initial metabolic pathways have been proposed for cdb-2914 (cdb: contraceptive development branch of
nichd) and cdb-4124, and their putative metabolites have been synthesized. we have examined the functional activities and potencies,
in various cell-based assays, and relative binding affinities (rbas) for progesterone receptors (pr) and glucocorticoid receptors (gr) of
the putative mono- and didemethylated metabolites of cdb-2914, cdb-4124, and mifepristone and of the 17␣-hydroxy and aromatic
a-ring derivatives of cdb-2914 and cdb-4124. the binding affinities of the monodemethylated metabolites for rabbit uterine pr and
human pr-a and pr-b were similar to those of the parent compounds. monodemethylated mifepristone bound to rabbit thymic gr with
higher affinity than monodemethylated cdb-2914 or cdb-4124. t47d-co cells were used to assess inhibition of r5020-stimulated
endogenous alkaline phosphatase activity and transactivation of the pre2 -thymidine kinase (tk)-luciferase (luc) reporter plasmid in transient transfections. the antiprogestational potency was as follows: mifepristone/cdb-2914/cdb-4124/monodemethylated metabolites
(ic50 ’s∼10−9 m) > aromatic a-ring derivatives (ic50 ’s∼10−8 m) > didemethylated/17␣-hydroxy derivatives (ic50 ’s∼10−7 m). antiglucocorticoid activity was determined by inhibition of dexamethasone-stimulated transcriptional activity in hepg2 cells. the mono- and
didemethylated metabolites of cdb-2914 and cdb-4124 had less antiglucocorticoid activity (ic50 ’s∼10−6 m) than monodemethylated
mifepristone (ic50 ∼10−8 m) or the other test compounds.  xxxd1891xxx −6 m in transcription assays, none of these compounds showed progestin
agonist activity, whereas mifepristone and its monodemethylated metabolite manifested slight glucocorticoid agonist activity. the reduced
antiglucocorticoid activity of monodemethylated cdb-2914 and cdb-4124 was confirmed in vivo by the thymus involution assay in
adrenalectomized male rats. the aromatic a-ring derivatives-stimulated transcription of an estrogen-responsive reporter plasmid in mcf-7
and t47d-co human breast cancer cells but were much less potent than estradiol. taken together, these data suggest that the proximal
metabolites of mifepristone, cdb-2914, and cdb-4124 contribute significantly to the antiprogestational activity of the parent compounds
in vivo. furthermore, the reduced antiglucocorticoid activity of cdb-2914 and cdb-4124 compared to mifepristone in vivo may be due
in part to decreased activity of their putative proximal metabolites.

conditions such as breast cancer, endometriosis, and leiomyomata. for these purposes, several progesterone antagonists
with 11␤-aryl substitutions have been synthesized and
characterized in recent years. mifepristone (ru486) was
the first steroid of this class to show high affinity binding
to the progestin receptor (pr) [1–5]. however, mifepristone, as well as other 11␤-aryl substituted antiprogestins,
also binds with high affinity to glucocorticoid receptors
(gr), resulting in antiglucocorticoid activity which could
produce undesirable side effects in vivo for therapies requiring chronic administration [1,6,7]. other antiprogestins

have been synthesized and tested in an attempt to identify relatively pure progesterone antagonists with little or
no antiglucocorticoid activity. two such potential drugs,
cdb-2914 (cdb: contraceptive development branch of
nichd) and cdb-4124, also with 11␤-aryl substitutions,
are derivatives of 19-norprogesterone, unlike mifepristone
which is derived from 19-nortestosterone. cdb-2914 and
cdb-4124 have been shown to be potent antiprogestins in
a variety of in vivo and in vitro assays, but to have less
antiglucocorticoid activity than mifepristone [8–10]. as
proximal metabolites may contribute significantly to the
pharmacological activity profile of antiprogestins, it is important to assess the activity, selectivity, and potency of these
metabolites. in vivo mifepristone undergoes rapid demethylation at the 11␤-4-dimethylaminophenyl group to monoand didemethylated mifepristone and hydroxylation at the
17␣-propynyl group [11]. similar pathways of metabolism
have been proposed for cdb-2914 and cdb-4124, and reference preparations of these putative metabolites have been
synthesized. in the present study, we compared activities and
potencies of mifepristone, cdb-2914, cdb-4124, and their
putative metabolites and synthetic derivatives in a series of
in vitro assays. the following metabolites and derivatives
were tested: monodemethylated mifepristone (cdb-4628);
monodemethylated cdb-2914 (cdb-3877); monodemethylated cdb-4124 (cdb-4453); didemethylated cdb-2914
(cdb-3963);
17␣-[3 -hydroxy-propynyl]-mifepristone
(cdb-4163);17␣-hydroxy cdb-2914 (cdb-3236); 17␣hydroxy cdb-4124 (cdb-4644); aromatic a-ring derivative of cdb-2914 (cdb-4183); and aromatic a-ring
derivative of cdb-4124 (cdb-4641). we were unable to
obtain didemethylated mifepristone, and didemethylated
cdb-4124 has been difficult to synthesize. we investigated
pr and gr binding affinities, inhibition of pr-mediated
transactivation or alkaline phosphatase activity in t47d-co
human breast cancer cells, and inhibition of gr-mediated
transactivation in hepg2 human hepatoblastoma cells. a
limited number of in vivo studies were also performed for
compounds available in sufficient quantity.

new zealand white (nzw) rabbits (ilar strain designation hra:(nzw)spf) were purchased from covance
research products (denver, pa) and housed in stainless
steel cages. rabbits were fed purina (st. louis, mo) laboratory rabbit diet (#5321) and fresh kale daily as a dietary
fiber supplement. immature female rabbits were primed
with e2 (5 ␮g per rabbit per day, injected sc for 6 days) for
determining antiprogestational activity (see section 2.7).
sprague–dawley cd rats (crl:cd(sd)igs br stock) were
purchased from charles river laboratories (kingston, ny),
housed in polycarbonate solid floor cages with bed-o-cob
bedding (andersons industrial products group, maumee,
ohio), and fed purina laboratory rodent diet (#5001) ad
libitum. all rats were group-housed. animals received tap
water ad libitum, except for adrenalectomized male rats
which received 0.9% saline ad libitum. the photoperiod for
the rabbit rooms was 12 h light/12 h dark and for the rat
rooms was 14 h light/10 h dark. the environmental conditions of the animal rooms were maintained as recommended
in the guide for the care and use of laboratory animals to
the maximum extent possible (national research council,

0.2 mm  xxxd3216xxx , 10% glycerol, 1 mm dtt) and
incubated with 6 nm 1,2-[3 h] progesterone (perkin-elmer
life sciences inc., boston, ma; 52 ci/mmol); competitors
were added at concentrations from 2 to 100 nm. for binding
to rhpr-a or rhpr-b, cytosol from sf9 cells (prepared in
tegmd buffer containing the following protease inhibitors:
bacitracin at 100 ␮g/ml, aprotinin at 2 ␮g/ml, leupeptin at
94 ␮g/ml, pepstatin a at 200 ␮g/ml) was incubated with
6.8 nm 1,2,6,7,16,17-[3 h] progesterone (perkin-elmer; 143
ci/mmol); competitors were added at concentrations from

1 to 100 nm. for binding to rabbit thymic gr, cytosol
was prepared in tegmd buffer and incubated with 6 nm
6,7-[3 h] dexamethasone (perkin-elmer; 35 or 40 ci/mmol);
competitors were added at concentrations from 2 to 100 nm.
after overnight incubation at 4 ◦ c, bound and unbound [3 h]
steroids were separated by addition of dextran-coated charcoal and centrifugation at 2100 × g for 15 min at 4 ◦ c. supernatants from gr assays were decanted and counted in a
beckman ls-1800 liquid scintillation counter. supernatants
containing pr were pipetted into 24-well microplates and

280

counted in a packard topcount liquid scintillation counter.
in all steroid receptor competitive binding assays, cpm
were entered into packard’s riasmarttm for calculation of
ec50 ’s using a 4-parameter logistic curve fit. relative binding affinities (rba, %) for each compound were calculated
as follows: ec50 of standard/ec50 of competitor × 100.
the standards for the pr and gr assays were progesterone
and dexamethasone, respectively.
the assay for human estrogen receptors (her) ␣ and
␤1-long form employed purified recombinant her purchased from panvera (madison, wi). er (0.45 pmol per
well) was incubated with 10 nm 6,7 or 2,4,6,7 –[3 h] e2
(perkin-elmer; 40–99 ci/mmole) in 10 mm tris, ph 7.5,
10% glycerol, 1 mg/ml ovalbumin, and 2 mm dtt in the
absence or presence of 2 ␮m e2 to measure total or nonspecific binding, respectively. the final ethanol concentration was 5%. competitors were added at concentrations
from 0.5 to 10,000 nm. incubations were carried out in
millipore multiscreen plates (millipore, burlington, ma)
at 4 ◦ c overnight. [3 h] e2 –er complexes were separated
from unbound radioligand by addition of 25 or 50 ␮l 50%
hydroxylapatite to each well, incubation for 15 min at 4 ◦ c
on a plate shaker, filtration on a vacuum manifold, and
washing three times with cold wash buffer (er␣: 40 mm
tris, ph 7.5, 100 mm kcl, 1 mm edta, 1 mm egta;
er␤-1 long: 40 mm tris, ph 7.5). plates were dried, and
the wells were punched out and transferred to scintillation
vials. receptor-bound cpm were determined in the beckman ls-1800 or wallac 1209 rackbeta scintillation counter
and entered into packard’s riasmarttm for calculation of
ec50 ’s as described above.
2.4. cell culture and transfection of plasmid dnas
cell culture reagents were obtained from invitrogen
(carlsbad, ca), unless otherwise specified. t47d-co human breast cancer cells were a gift of dr. kathryn horwitz
(university of colorado health science center, denver,
co). they were grown routinely in monolayer culture
in phenol red-free dmem supplemented with 10% fetal
bovine serum (fbs), 10 u/ml  xxxd2871xxx , and 10 ␮g/ml
streptomycin sulfate (pen/strep). hepg2 human hepatoblastoma cells purchased from atcc (manassas, va) and
mcf-7 cells (from dr. sanford simon at the rockefeller
university, new york, ny) were grown in monolayer culture in phenol red-free mem␣ supplemented with 10% fbs
and pen/strep. for transient transfection assays, cells were
plated in 6-well dishes at ∼ 0.5–1 × 106 cells per well in
the corresponding medium containing 10% dextran-coated
charcoal (dcc)-stripped fbs (hyclone laboratories inc.,
logan, ut) and pen/strep and used 24–48 h later at 60–80%
confluency. approximately, 1–2 h prior to transfection, the
medium was withdrawn, and fresh medium was added.
t47d-co cells, which express approximately equimolar concentrations of constitutively produced hpr-a and
hpr-b (k. horwitz, personal communication) were used

to assess progestational agonist or antagonist activities
in an estrogen-free environment [13]. these cells were
transfected with the pre2 -thymidine kinase (tk)-luciferase
(luc) reporter plasmid, containing two copies of the progestin/glucocorticoid/androgen response element upstream
of the thymidine kinase promoter and the firefly luciferase
reporter gene (from dr. dean edwards), using fugene
6 transfection reagent (roche, indianapolis, in) according
to the manufacturer’s instructions (ratio of fugene 6 to
dna: 6 to 1). hepg2 cells were used to assess glucocorticoid agonist or antagonist activity. these cells were
cotransfected with pre2 -tk-luc and a rat gr expression plasmid (6rgr from drs. roger miesfeld and keith
yamamoto, ucsf, san francisco, ca) at a ratio of 20:1 using fugene 6 transfection reagent as described previously
[10]. both t47d-co and mcf-7 cells were used for assessing estrogenic activity of the aromatic a-ring derivatives of
cdb-2914 and cdb-4124 using a 3xere-luc reporter
plasmid (from dr. donald mcdonnell, duke university,
durham, nc). briefly, for each transfection experiment, a
sufficient quantity of fugene 6–dna complexes was prepared to dispense to all control and hormone-treated wells,
in duplicate or triplicate. after 6 h, cells were washed with
dpbs and incubated in fresh medium containing test compounds or vehicle for 20 h. in every experiment, separate
wells were transfected with a control vector,  xxxg2041xxx -luc
(promega corp., madison, wi), to monitor transfection
efficiency and interassay variability. cell lysates were prepared in passive lysis buffer (promega) and analyzed
for protein content [14]. luc activity was determined in
20 ␮l aliquots of the lysates using promega’s luciferase
assay system. light emission was measured in a microplate luminometer (fluoroskan ascent fl, labsystems,
franklin, ma) and expressed as relative light units (rlu).
data were normalized for differences in protein content
per well.
2.5. alkaline phosphatase assay
inhibition of alkaline phosphatase activity in t47d-co
cells was assessed as described previously [10]. briefly, cells
were transferred to dmem containing 10% dcc-stripped
fbs and pen/strep. after 24 h, they were seeded in 96-well
plates at 5 × 104 cells per well and incubated at 37 ◦ c. the
following day, the medium was aspirated, and fresh medium
(150 ␮l) containing test compounds was added. antagonist
activity was determined by incubating cells with 10−8 m
r5020 in the presence of antiprogestins, metabolites, or
derivatives (10−10 to 10−6 m) for an additional 72 h. cells
were washed with pbs and lysed by freeze-thawing. plates
were placed on ice, and 50 ␮l alkaline phosphatase assay mix
(5 mm  xxxd2822xxx ,  xxxd2822xxx : pierce, rockford,
il; 0.24 mm mgcl2 , 1 m diethanolamine, ph 9.8) was added
to each well according to the procedure of markiewicz and
gurpide [15]. plates were incubated at room temperature for
2 or 4 h to allow color development, and the od at 405 nm

b.j. attardi et al. / journal of steroid biochemistry & molecular biology 88 (2004) 277–288

was determined in a molecular devices microplate reader
(sunnyvale, ca).
2.6. aromatization reaction
incubation of test compounds (testosterone, cdb-2914,
cdb-4124) with human  xxxg574xxx  + p450 reductase supersomes (bd biosciences, woburn, ma) was carried out
according to the manufacturer’s recommendations. a 250 ␮l
reaction mixture contained 25 pmol human  xxxg574xxx  + p450,
50 ␮m substrate in ethanol, 1.3 mm nadp+ , 3.3 mm
glucose-6-phosphate, 0.4 u/ml  xxxg825xxx , and 3.3 mm mgcl2 in 100 mm kpo4 , ph 7.4.
the mixture was incubated at 37 ◦ c for 40 min during
which time production of e2 from testosterone was linear.
after incubation, the reaction was stopped by addition of
125 ␮l acetonitrile (acn) and centrifuged  xxxd1891xxx ,000 × g for
3 min. fifty microliters of the supernatant were injected into
a 4.6 mm × 250 mm phenomenex luna 5 ␮ c18 hplc column (phenomenex, torrance, ca) and eluted isocratically
with mobile phases empirically determined to separate the
substrate from the aromatic a-ring product: testosterone/e2 :
60% h2 o, 30% acn, 10% methanol; cdb-2914/aromatic
a-ring cdb-2914: 50% h2 o, 40% acn, 10% methanol;
cdb-4124/aromatic a-ring cdb-4124: 35% h2 o, 50%
acn, 15% methanol at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. decrease of
substrate and formation of product were monitored by absorbance at 216 nm (testosterone/e2 ), 254 nm (cdb-2914/
aromatic a-ring derivative), or 248 nm (cdb-4124/aromatic
a-ring derivative).

cdb-2914, monodemethylated cdb-4124, or mifepristone
(1.5, 3, or 6 mg per rat per day for 3 days; 10 rats per
group), or vehicle, in an attempt to block sc administered
methylprednisolone-induced thymus involution (1 mg mp
per rat per day for 3 days). for oral dosing, rats were
restrained, and a 16 gauge ball-tipped 3 in. curved stainless steel gavage needle was used to deliver the dosing
solution directly to the stomach. twenty-four hours after
the final dose, rats were euthanized, the final body weight
recorded, and the thymus gland excised, trimmed, blotted,
and weighed [8,18].
2.9. analysis of data
graphpad prism, versions 2.0 or 3.0 (graphpad software, san diego, ca), was used for graphics and determination of ic50 ’s and ec50 ’s for inhibition or stimulation, respectively, of transactivation or alkaline phosphatase activity
by antagonists or agonists of pr or gr. multiple determinations of the ic50 ’s for different test compounds were compared statistically by one-way analysis of variance (anova)
followed by bonferroni’s t-test for all pairwise data using
sigmastat, version 2.03 (spss inc., chicago, il). thymus
weights in the antiglucocorticoid bioassay were compared by
one-way anova followed by the student–newman–keuls
multiple range test. data that did not pass normality were
log10 transformed prior to analysis. p < 0.05 was considered to be statistically significant.

2.7. in vivo antiprogestational activity
3.1. pr and gr binding characteristics
inhibition of progesterone-stimulated endometrial glandular arborization was assessed according to the mcphail
scale in e2 -primed immature female rabbits (five per
group) treated with the test compound either by the oral
or intrauterine route [8,16,17]. intrauterine administration
(0.25–1.0 ␮g) was employed to examine direct antiprogestational effects of mono- and didemethylated cdb-2914
and monodemethylated cdb-4124 on the uterine endometrium [17]. oral administration of the putative metabolites (0.4–1.6 mg per rabbit per day for 5 days) to e2 -primed
rabbits was used to evaluate the contribution of further
metabolism. for oral dosing, rabbits were restrained, and
0.5 ml of vehicle or dosing solution was slowly delivered to
the back of the throat using a 16 gauge ball-tipped 4.5 in.
curved stainless steel gavage needle attached to a 1 ml airtight syringe. to insure accuracy, the gavage needle was
preloaded with the proper dosing solution.
2.8. in vivo antiglucocorticoid activity
to assess antiglucocorticoid activity, young male rats
(100–120 g) were adrenalectomized using aseptic surgical technique and treated orally with monodemethylated

fig. 1 illustrates the chemical structures of mifepristone, cdb-2914, cdb-4124, and all putative metabolites
and synthetic derivatives evaluated in the present study.
table 1 summarizes the ec50 ’s and relative binding affinities of these compounds for rabbit uterine pr (pr-b; [19]),
rhpr-a or rhpr-b, and rabbit thymic gr. mifepristone, the
cdb antiprogestins, and their monodemethylated metabolites bound with high affinity to rabbit uterine pr. in contrast, affinities of mifepristone and cdb-2914 for rhpr-a
and rhpr-b were two to three-fold greater than those of
cdb-4124 and its putative monodemethylated metabolite.
the ec50 ’s and rbas for binding to rhpr-a were very
similar to those for binding to rhpr-b for all the compounds tested. some compounds showed higher affinity for
rabbit pr than rhpr-a or b, especially monodemethylated
mifepristone, cdb-4124, and didemethylated cdb-2914.
the 17␣-hydroxy derivatives had the lowest affinities for
pr. mifepristone and its monodemethylated metabolite
showed the highest affinity for rabbit thymic gr, whereas
didemethylated cdb-2914 and the aromatic a-ring compounds showed the lowest (table 1). affinities of the other
test compounds for gr were similar (rbas = 40–50%).

antiprogestational activity was assessed in t47d-co
cells by inhibition of r5020-stimulated induction of endogenous alkaline phosphatase activity or of transcription of
the pre2 -tk-luc reporter plasmid. representative one-site
inhibitor curves for monodemethylated mifepristone and

fig. 2a. ic50 ’s for these and all other compounds tested
were calculated and potencies expressed relative to mifepristone (=1) (table 2). the monodemethylated metabolites
of mifepristone, cdb-2914, and cdb-4124 manifested
considerable potency as antiprogestins in both assays.
the relative potency of the various test compounds was
similar in the alkaline phosphatase and transcription assays: monodemethylated > aromatic a-ring derivatives >
didemethylated/17␣-hydroxy derivatives. steroidal pr ligands have been reported to demonstrate agonist, antagonist,
or mixed agonist activities. fig. 3a shows that in this cell
system, mifepristone, cdb-2914, cdb-4124, and their
metabolites/derivatives, even  xxxd1891xxx −6 m, did not exhibit

e2 , and progestins showed little or no induction of luc
activity [10]. the antiglucocorticoid potency of the various
antiprogestins, metabolites, and derivatives was assessed in
hepg2 cells by dose-dependent inhibition of dexamethasone (10−8 m)-stimulated transcription of pre2 -tk-luc.
representative one-site inhibitor curves for monodemethylated mifepristone and cdb-2914 are illustrated in fig. 2b.
ic50 ’s were calculated, and potencies expressed relative to
mifepristone (=1) (table 2). monodemethylated mifepristone, like mifepristone itself, was considerably more potent
as a glucocorticoid antagonist than mono- or didemethylated cdb-2914 or monodemethylated cdb-4124. the
antiglucocorticoid activity of the aromatic a-ring and
17␣-hydroxy derivatives of cdb-2914 or cdb-4124 was
equivalent, but low. possible glucocorticoid agonist activity
was investigated by treating transfected hepg2 cells with
test compounds  xxxd1891xxx −6 m, dexamethasone  xxxd1891xxx −8 m, or
vehicle (ethanol or dmso) (fig. 3b). mifepristone and
monodemethylated mifepristone  xxxd1891xxx −6 m stimulated luciferase activity four to five-fold over basal; however, the
effect was much less than that of dexamethasone  xxxd1891xxx −8 m.
all other compounds had negligible glucocorticoid agonist
activity.
3.4. estrogenic activity of the aromatic a-ring
derivatives of cdb-2914 and cdb-4124
aromatic a-ring derivatives of cdb-2914 and cdb-4124
were prepared for this study by organic chemists to determine whether these synthetic derivatives possess estrogenic activity. both compounds stimulated transcription of 3xere-luc, but with low potency (not shown).
the ec50 ’s for transactivation in t47d-co cells were
2–3 × 10−7 m, about four orders of magnitude higher than
that for e2 (ec50 = 2.5 ± 0.8 × 10−11 m, mean ± s.d.,
n = 2). in mcf-7 cells, the response to aromatic a-ring
derivatives was biphasic: transcription of 3xere-luciferase

was stimulated at concentrations ≤10−7 m and inhibited at higher concentrations (not shown). rbas for both
her␣ and her␤-1 of the aromatic a-ring derivatives of
cdb-2914 and cdb-4124 were <1 and <0.1%, respectively (compared to e2 as reference standard at 100%).
mifepristone, cdb-2914, and cdb-4124 did not bind to
her (ec50 ’s > 10,000 nm; rbas < 0.1%). using human
 xxxg574xxx  (aromatase) + p450 reductase supersomes, we
attempted to detect a-ring aromatization of cdb-2914 and
cdb-4124 using conditions established for demonstrating
aromatization of testosterone to e2 . there was no evidence
for formation of the aromatic a-ring derivative of either
cdb-2914 or cdb-4124 in this system during a 40 min
incubation (data not shown).
3.5. in vivo studies with metabolites of cdb-2914 and
cdb-4124
in most cases, the quantities of putative metabolites/synthetic derivatives available were too limited to
perform in vivo assays. however, when possible, compounds were tested for antiprogestational activity in rabbits,
following intrauterine or oral administration, and for oral
antiglucocorticoid activity in the adrenalectomized male rat.
neither monodemethylated cdb-2914 nor monodemethylated cdb-4124 demonstrated significant antiprogestational
activity after oral dosing. however, inhibition (10–60%) of
endometrial gland arborization based on the mcphail index
was observed for mono- and didemethylated cdb-2914
and monodemethylated cdb-4124 following intrauterine
administration (data not shown). these results support the
notion that the metabolites possess some antiprogestational
activity in vivo but are rapidly metabolized further following systemic administration. in the antiglucocorticoid assay
(fig. 4), mifepristone, at all doses tested (4.5, 9, or 18 mg
total dose), significantly (p < 0.05) reversed mp-induced
thymus involution. in contrast, thymus weights from rats

treated with monodemethylated cdb-2914, at all dose levels, were not different (p > 0.05) from those of mp-treated
rats. monodemethylated cdb-4124 significantly (p < 0.05)
reversed the mp-induced thymus weight decrease only at
the highest dose, but thymus weight was significantly lower
than that from vehicle-treated rats (p < 0.05).
4. discussion
the metabolism of mifepristone has been studied extensively although there has been little prior examination of
the functional activity and potency of the metabolites in cell
systems. in humans, rats, and monkeys, mifepristone undergoes rapid demethylation at the 11␤-4-dimethylaminophenyl
group to mono- and didemethylated mifepristone and hydroxylation at the 17␣-propynyl group ([11]; reviewed in
[20]). in humans there are seven “possible” metabolites,
but the three mentioned above have been identified. the
n-monodemethylated product is the primary metabolite, and
after oral administration of 100–800 mg mifepristone, its
concentration exceeds that of the parent compound [21,22].
at higher dose levels of mifepristone (>400 mg), the other
metabolites also accumulate at high concentrations [21].
both the demethylated and hydroxylated metabolites are
eventually further degraded and excreted into bile [11]. from
metabolic studies performed on rat liver or hepatoma cells,
chasserot–golaz et al. [23,24] concluded that demethylation of mifepristone is mediated by cytochromes p450 2b
and 2c, whereas cyp450 3a4 is responsible for the hydroxylation steps. cyp 3a4 has also been shown to be the
primary cyp enzyme involved in oxidative metabolism of
mifepristone in human liver microsomes [25].
the half-life (t1/2 ) for elimination of mifepristone has
been reported to vary between 24 and 48 h when measured
by hplc and between 54 and 90 h when measured by radioimmunoassay (ria) or radioreceptor assay (rra) (see
[20]). the longer apparent t1/2 obtained by ria or rra is
likely due to cross-reactivity with various metabolites. as
described previously [26], monoclonal antibodies to mifepristone provided by dr. fortune kohen (weitzman institute
of science, rehovot, israel) exhibited 86, 57, and <1%
cross-reactivity with monodemethylated, didemethylated,
and hydroxylated mifepristone, respectively. by analogy to
the authenticated pathway for metabolism of mifepristone,
putative metabolites have been proposed for cdb-2914 and
cdb-4124 involving monodemethylation, didemethylation,
and hydroxylation at the 17␣ position. we have developed
an ria for cdb-2914 [26] which employs rabbit polyclonal antibodies. this antiserum cross reacts extensively
with several of the putative metabolites/synthetic derivatives
of cdb-2914 (monodemethylated, 90%; didemethylated,
62%; aromatic a-ring, 25%; 17␣-hydroxy, <1%). currently, an assay involving hplc separation of cdb-2914
and metabolites is under development by hra pharma
(paris, france) which is expected to provide more extensive

information about the nature and time-course of appearance
of various metabolites [27]. preliminary hplc and lc/ms
results have confirmed that the mono- and dimethylated
metabolites of cdb-2914 are present in rat plasma and
bile after intravenous or oral administration of cdb-2914
(5 mg/kg) to female rats. in addition to the parent compound, three other metabolites were found in plasma and a
total of six, in bile [gainer, hra pharma, personal communication].
it is clear from the foregoing that the biological activity
and potency of these early major metabolites are important
considerations. in the present study, we investigated the
binding to pr and gr and the functional activities in cultured cells of the currently available metabolites/derivatives
of mifepristone, cdb-2914, and cdb-4124. the monoand didemethylated and the hydroxylated metabolites of
mifepristone were shown previously to bind to human uterine pr and placental gr [28]. mifepristone, cdb-2914,
and their monodemethylated metabolites bound to rhpr-a
and rhpr-b and rabbit pr with the highest affinity. the
affinities of the other compounds for pr were ranked as follows: cdb-4124/mondemethylated cdb-4124 > aromatic
a-ring derivatives > didemethylated/17␣-hydroxy derivatives. the monodemethylated metabolites of mifepristone,
cdb-2914, and cdb-4124 manifested considerable potency
as antiprogestins in the alkaline phosphatase and transcription assays. the relative potency of the various test compounds was similar in both assays: mifepristone/cdb-2914/
cdb-4124/monodemethylated
metabolites
(ic50 ’s∼
10−9 m) > aromatic a-ring derivatives (ic50 ’s∼10−8 m) >
didemethylated/17␣-hydroxy derivatives (ic50 ’s∼10−7 m).
these results indicate that the relative inhibitory potency
of these metabolites/derivatives depends on their relative
binding affinities for pr.
mifepristone and its mondemethylated metabolite showed
the highest affinity for rabbit thymic gr, whereas didemethylated cdb-2914 and the aromatic a-ring compounds
showed the lowest. affinities of the other test compounds
for gr were similar. monodemethylated mifepristone,
like mifepristone itself, was considerably more potent
as a glucocorticoid antagonist than monodemethylated
cdb-2914 or cdb-4124 or didemethylated cdb-2914.
the antiglucocorticoid activity of the aromatic a-ring and
17␣-hydroxy derivatives of cdb-2914 or cdb-4124 was
equivalent, but low. rbas for gr were not predictive of
functional activity confirming that other factors, such as
interactions with coregulators, are probably of importance
in modulating transactivation/transrepression [29]. relative to mifepristone (=1), the ratio of antiprogestational to
antiglucocorticoid activity was highest for the putative monodemethylated metabolites of cdb-2914 and cdb-4124
(=50–100), followed by cdb-2914, cdb-4124, and
didemethylated cdb-2914. this ratio approximated 1 for
monodemethylated mifepristone and the aromatic a-ring
derivatives, whereas it was 0.1–0.2 for the 17␣-hydroxy
derivatives.

b.j. attardi et al. / journal of steroid biochemistry & molecular biology 88 (2004) 277–288

in most cases, it was not possible to confirm activity
of the metabolites in vivo as the amounts of compounds
available were too limited, and further metabolism would
likely occur. the results of the oral versus intrauterine antiprogestational activities of the putative monodemethylated
metabolites of cdb-2914 and cdb-4124 support the notion that these metabolites possess some antiprogestational
activity in vivo, but are rapidly metabolized further to less
potent derivatives following systemic administration. however, the monodemethylated metabolites of cdb-2914 and
cdb-4124 both showed very reduced antiglucocorticoid activity in vivo, as well as in vitro, compared to mifepristone
and its monodemethylated metabolite. in addition, the low
level of glucocorticoid agonist activity observed here in transcription assays in hepg2 cells is in agreement with our in
vivo results. mifepristone, cdb-2914, and cdb-4124 had
negligible glucocorticoid agonist activity in the adrenalectomized male rat thymolytic assay at doses up to 3.33–4 mg
per day (10–12 mg total dose).
the biological activity of the antiprogestin metabolites,
especially the proximal ones, is of great importance due to
the rapid metabolism of the parent compounds in vivo. the
data presented here strongly suggest that certain metabolites of the antiprogestins, particularly the monomethylated
derivatives, may contribute quite significantly to the in vivo
antiprogestational/ antiglucocorticoid activity profiles of the
parent compounds. currently, cdb-2914 and cdb-4124
are being tested, both in animal models and clinical trials,
for emergency and long-term, low dose contraceptive use
and for treatment of hormone dependent diseases such as
breast cancer, endometriosis, and uterine fibroids. in particular, the reduced antiglucocorticoid activity of cdb-2914
and cdb-4124 (and their monodemethylated metabolites)
may provide considerable advantage over mifepristone for
gynecological and contraceptive uses that require chronic
administration.
