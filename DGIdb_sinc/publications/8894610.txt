abstract
the influence of (+)-tamsulosin, a selective a~a-adrenoceptor antagonist, on the positive inotropic effect and the accumulation of
inositol phosphates that are induced via c~-adrenoceptors was studied in comparison with that of another alg-adrenoceptor ligand
oxymetazoline in the rabbit ventricular myocardium. phenylephrine elicited a concentration-dependent positive inotropic effect via
a l-adrenoceptors in the presence of either (+)- xxxd384xxx  or s ( - )- xxxd3377xxx . the mode of antagonism induced by (_)-tamsulosin on the
effect of phenylephrine was dependent on the concentration applied: (+)-tamsulosin at 1 and 3 nm acted in a competitive manner, the
slope of the regression line of the schild plot being unity and the pa 2 value being 9.12; at l0 nm, it shifted further the
concentration-response curve to the right without affecting the maximal response but the slope became less than unity. at 100 nm and
higher, it suppressed the maximal response to phenylephrine. (+)-tamsulosin effectively antagonized the positive inotropic effect of
phenylephrine even after inactivation of am-adrenoceptors by treatment with chlorethylclonidine, which is an indication that the
( + )-tamsulosin-sensitive subtype belongs to a class resistant to chlorethylclonidine. ( _+)-tamsulosin, over the range of concentrations at
which it antagonized the positive inotropic effect mediated by al-adrenoceptors, did not affect the accumulation of [3h]inositol
phosphates that was induced by l0 /xm phenylephrine. oxymetazoline antagonized the positive inotropic effect of phenylephrine in a
competitive manner without affecting the accumulation of inositol monophosphate induced by phenylephrine. these results indicate that
the positive inotropic effect, mediated via (+)-tamsulosin- and oxymetazoline-sensitive subtype of cq-adrenoceptors, is exerted by a
subcellular mechanism that is independent of the accumulation of inositol phosphates.

1. introduction
myocardial al-adrenoceptors mediate the positive inotropic effect of sympathomimetic amines in most mammalian species, for example, the rabbit, rat, cat, ferret and
human (scholz, 1980; endoh, 1982; terzic et al., 1993).
inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (ip 3) and diacylglycerol, products of the acceleration of the hydrolysis of phosphoinositide that is induced by stimulation of c~radrenoceptors,
have been postulated to play a critical role as intracellular
messengers in a~-mediated signal transduction in the

mammalian heart (brown et al., 1985; poggioli et al.,
1986; otani et al., 1988; scholz et al., 1988; endoh et al.,
1991). however, the role of this pathway in mediating the
positive inotropic effect of al-adrenoceptor agonists remains controversial.
c~-adrenoceptors can be divided into at least two pharmacologically distinct subtypes, cqa- and c~b-adrenoce ptors. a~a-adrenoceptors may be coupled to the acceleration of the hydrolysis of phosphoinositide a n d / o r to l-type
ca 2+ channels and may have a higher affinity than the
c~lb-subtype for antagonists such as wb 4101 {n-[2-(2,6dimethoxyphenoxy)ethyl]-2,3-dihydro- 1,4-benzodioxin-2methanamine}, 5-methylurapidil and (+)-niguldipine. the
am-adrenoceptors are predominantly coupled to the acceleration of the hydrolysis of phosphoinositide and they are

irreversibly blocked by chlorethylclonidine, an alkylating
agent (han et al., 1987; minneman, 1988: terzic et al..
1993). although both %a- and oqb-adrenoceptors are
present in myocardial cells, the relative contribution of
oela- and cqb-adrenoceptors to the hydrolysis of phosphoinositide in the heart is not yet fully understood. our
previous studies with the subtype-selective antagonist
chlorethylclonidine suggest that about 63% of %-adrenoceptors in the rabbit ventricular myocardium are c~jb-adrenoceptors (takanashi et al., 1991) and, moreover, there
seems to be a very close correlation between the extent of
inhibition by chlorethylclonidine of the positive inotropic
effect and the accumulation of [3h]ip~ (inositol monophosphate) or [3h]ip3 via stimulation of c~j-adrenoceptors
(takanashi et al., 1991: yang and endoh, 1994). by
contrast, (+)-niguldipine has only a limited inhibitory
effect on the positive inotropic effect and it does not
influence the accumulation of inositol monophosphate,
while wb 4101 shifts the concentration-response curve for
phenylephfine, with partial inhibition of the acceleration of
the accumulation of inositol phosphates (endoh et al.,
1992a,b; yang and endoh, 1994), these findings suggest
that the c~la-adrenoceptors in rabbit ventricular myocardium might be heterogeneous.
in recent years, molecular cloning of oz~-adrenoceptors
from a variety of mammalian species has revealed the
existence of three genes encoding distinct subtypes, o~u,,
oq~ and oqd (lomasney et al., 1991; hirasawa et al.,
1993; rokosh et al., 1994). the cloned aib-adrenoceptors
display a pharmacology similar to that of the originally
defined am-subtype, while the cloned oq~-adrenoceptors
may be the same as the pharmacologically defined oqasubtype (ford et al., 1994) and are referred to as oej,adrenoceptors (hieble et al., 1995). hence, a distinction
between the cloned subtypes (oq,,, o~jb and %0) and the
classical pharmacologically defined subtypes (o~ja and
oqb) is made by use of lower and upper case subscript
throughout this study.
tamsulosin, 5-[2-[[2-(2-ethoxyphenoxy)ethyl]-amino]propyl]-2-methoxybenzenesulfonamide-hcl, has been
reported to be an extremely potent and highly selective
antagonist of %-adrenoceptors (honda et al., 1985) and it
antagonizes the cq-mediated positive inotropic effect with
high affinity, similar to that of  xxxd3000xxx , in the rabbit
myocardium (hiramoto et al., 1988). in receptor-binding
assays, tamsulosin has been shown to have high affinity
for c~a-adrenoceptors (hanft et al., 1989; garcfa-sfiinz et
al., 1995). in addition, among cloned subtypes of c~adrenoceptors from the rat, this compound has a high
selectivity for ara-adrenoceptors (michel and insel, 1994)
and adrenoceptors of this type are known to exist in
myocardial cells (hirasawa et al., 1993; rokosh et al.,
1994). it is also reported that oxymetazoline, another
%-adrenoceptor ligand (schtimann and endoh, 1976), has
selective affinity for the a~a- (faure et al., 1994) or
a~-adrenoceptor (faure et al., 1994: minneman et al..

1994: schwinn et al., 1995). so, we carried out the present
experiments to examine whether the antagonistic action of
tamsulosin on the positive inotropic effect that is mediated
by %-adrenoceptors might be associated with inhibition of
the accumulation of inositol phosphates, in comparison
with another c,~a-adrenoceptor ligand oxymetazoline, in
the rabbit ventricular myocardium.

2. materials and methods

2.1. anah,sis o[' inotropic effects in isolated rabbit papil[~ifv jtliiscic

male albino rabbits (1.8-2.2 kg) were anaesthetized
with pentobarbital sodium (50 m g / k g i.v.) and then two or
three papillary muscles were excised from the right ventricle of each rabbit. muscles were mounted in 20-ml organ
baths that contained krebs-henseleit solution (with 0.057
mm  xxxd228xxx  and 0.027 mm edta. 2na to prevent
autoxidation of the compounds examined). the solution
was bubbled with 95% 02 and 5% co 2 at 37°c (ph 7.4).
the concentrations (ram) of the various components of the
solution were as follows: na +, 142.9; k +, 5.9; mg 2+, 1.2:
ca 2~, 2.5; h2po4-, 1.2; hco:~-, 24.9; so4-, 1.2; c1 .
127.8; and glucose, 11.1. the muscles were stimulated
electrically by square-wave pulses of 5-ms duration at a
voltage about 20% above threshold and a frequency of 1
hz, during the equilibration period (60 rain) the muscles
were initially stretched under a tension of 5 mn and the
length was then adjusted to give 90% of the maximal
developed tension. the dimensions of the papillary muscles used were as follows: length, 5.06 + 0.07 ram; crosssectional area 0.55 + 0.02 mm 2 (n = 137).
in all experiments, a /3-adrenoceptor antagonist (_+) xxxd384xxx  or s(-)- xxxd3377xxx  (1 p.m each) was included in
the buffer to avoid any possible modulation of responses
by released noradrenaline and to ensure that the response
to phenylephrine did not involve activation by /3-adrenoceptors. at the beginning of each experiment, phenylephrine (3 /,m) was applied at least twice until reproducible responses were obtained. the concentration-response curve for phenylephrine was determined for each
preparation by cumulative addition of the drug. each succeeding concentration was added only after the preparation
had achieved a steady-state response to the previous concentration. after determination of the control concentration-response curve for phenylephrine, the drug was washed
out for at least 120 rain and then (+)-tamsulosin (1 nm-1
/xm) or oxymetazoline (0.3-10 p,m) was allowed to act
for 30 rain before the concentration-response curve for
phenylephrine was determined again. in some experiments,
preparations were treated with 10 /xm chlorethylclonidine
for 30 rain with subsequent washing for 30 rain, and then
the concentration-response curve for phenylephrine was
determined as described above. at the end of each experi-

14.-t. yang, m. endoh/ european journal of pharmacology 312 (1996) 281-291

ment, the maximum contractile force was determined for
each muscle by administration of  xxxd2398xxx  (0.1 ~m-0.1
mm). the response to phenylephrine was expressed as a
percentage of the maximal response to  xxxd2398xxx .

2.2. quantitation of inositol phosphate
the heart was quickly removed from a rabbit under
anaesthesia with pentobarbital sodium and placed in
krebs-henseleit solution, bubbled with 95% 0 2 and 5%
co 2, at 37°c in order to wash out the blood. the experimental procedure was the same as that described previously (takanashi et al., 1991). slices of ventricular muscle
(0.5 mm thick) were prepared with a tissue slicer (arthur
h. thomas, philadelphia, pa) in cold ( ~ 4°c) krebshenseleit solution. after being weighed, the slices were
equilibrated in krebs-henseleit solution for 30 min at 37°c
and then the slices were preincubated with 10 ~ c i / m l
myo-[3h]inositol in krebs-henseleit solution for 120 min.
after the preincubation, slices were washed with a fresh
solution containing 5 mm myo-inositol and 10 mm lici
and all the experiments were performed in the li +-containing solution. (+)- xxxd384xxx  (1 ~m) was added to the
solution 20 min prior to administration of the agonist to
avoid any interference due to activation of /3-adrenoceptors. (+)-tamsulosin or oxymetazoline was allowed to act
for 30 min before and during administration of 10 p~m

phenylephrine. phenylephrine was allowed to act for 5 min
((+)-tamsulosin-treated group) or 30 min (oxymetazoline-treated group) and then the slices were quickly
blotted and put into 1.0 ml of a mixture of chloroform,
methanol and 12 n hcl (100: 200: 1, v / v ) to terminate
the reaction. after addition of 0.2 ml of 5 mm edta, the
tissue was homogenized with a homogenizer (polytron
pt-10; kinematica, lucerne, switzerland). the tip of the
homogenizer was rinsed with 0.5 ml of a mixture of
chloroform, methanol, 12 n hcl and 5 mm edta
(100 : 200 : l : 80, v / v ) , and the rinsing fluid was added to
the original solution. chloroform (0.4 ml) and 5 mm
edta (0.5 ml) were added sequentially and the samples
were centrifuged at 1400 × g for 20 rain to separate the
aqueous and organic phases. an aliquot of the aqueous
layer was applied to a column that contained a 50% slurry
of agl-x8 (anion-exchange resin; 100-200 mesh; formate form; bio-rad, richmond, ca). the column was
washed first with 20 ml of distilled water and then glycerophosphoryl esters were eluted with 8 ml of a solution of
5 mm sodium tetraborate and 60 mm sodium formate
(berridge et al., 1983). aliquots of the eluate were monitored for radioactivity in a scintillation mixture (acs-ii;
amersham, arlington heights, il) with a scintillation
counter (tri-carb 1500, packard, downers grove, il)
at a counting efficiency of 66%. [3h]ip1, [3h]ip2 (inositol
1,4-bisphosphate) and [3h]ip3 were separately collected,
and the radioactivity of each was quantitated. [3h]ip1 was

the inhibitory action of ( ± )-tamsulosin in the presence
of another /3-adrenoceptor blocker, s ( - ) - t i m o l o l , 1 /~m
(fig. 3), was very similar to that observed in the presence
of 1 /xm  xxxd384xxx . the slope of the schild plot was 0.94
for concentrations of 1 and 3 nm (+)-tamsulosin, and the
line intercepted the x-axis at a p a 2 value of 9.34. however, when the higher concentration of 10 nm ( + ) tamsulosin was included in the analysis, the slope of the
schild plot became 0.69 (fig. 3), which was less than unity
( p < 0 . 0 5 ) . (+_)-tamsulosin at 100 nm suppressed the
maximal response to phenylephrine more prominently in
the presence of  xxxd3377xxx , indicating that  xxxd3377xxx  is more
potent than  xxxd384xxx  as a /3-adrenoceptor blocking agent.
when the extracellular calcium concentration was decreased to 1.25 mm from 2.50 mm, the maximal inotropic
response to phenylephrine was significantly decreased to
57.4 + 1.5% (n = 18) vs. 64.7 + 1.8% (n = 34, p < 0.01)
of the maximal response to  xxxd2398xxx , while the basal
force of contraction did not change significantly. the
inhibitory action of (_+)-tamsulosin ( 1 - 1 0 nm) in the
presence of 1.25 mm extracellular calcium concentration
and 1 /zm  xxxd3377xxx  was essentially the same as that with the
extracellular calcium concentration of 2.50 mm (n = 18;

3.2. influence of (4-)-tamsulosin on the c~l-adrenoceptormediated positive inotropic effect in preparations treated
with chlorethylclonidine
inactivation of c~m-adrenoceptors by treatment with 10
/xm chlorethylclonidine did not alter the basal force of
contraction, but it shifted the concentration-response curve
for phenylephrine to the right and decreased its slope (fig.
4). the maximal inotropic effect of phenylephrine was
diminished by 64.4% (to 19.0 __+ 1.2% of the maximal
response to  xxxd2398xxx  in chlorethylclonidine-treated
muscles from 53.4 + 1.9% in the control) and the ecs0 for
phenylephrine was increased 5.3-fold from a control value
of 1.58 ± 0.13 /zm (n = 25) to 8.40 ± 0.62 /zm (n = 30)
in chlorethylclonidine-treated muscles.
in muscles treated with chlorethylclonidine, ( + ) tamsulosin effectively antagonized the phenylephrineinduced positive inotropic effect (fig. 5), an indication that
the (±)-tamsulosin-sensitive subtype belongs to a class
that is resistant to treatment with chlorethylclonidine. because very high concentrations of phenylephrine had to be
used in chlorethylclonidine-treated muscles, the effect of
phenylephrine that is mediated by fl-adrenoceptors disturbed the determination of the nature of the antagonism
induced by (±)-tamsulosin in chlorethylclonidine-treated
muscles. although the maximal response to phenylephrine
was apparently achieved even in the presence of high
concentrations of (___)-tamsulosin, this may be due to the

4. discussion
in isolated rabbit papillary muscle, the selective o/iaadrenoceptor antagonist (_+)-tamsulosin (honda et al.,
1985) antagonized the positive inotropic effect of phenylephrine in a concentration-dependent manner: ( + ) tamsulosin at 1 to 10 nm shifted the concentration-response curves for phenylephrine in parallel to the right
without altering the maximal response, while the maximal
response was attenuated at the relatively high concentrations of 100 nm and 1 /zm (figs. 1-3). this result
indicates that (+)-tamsulosin acts predominantly as a
competitive antagonist of a~-adrenoceptors in rabbit ventricular muscle (hiramoto et al., 1988).
it has been reported that (+)-tamsulosin is a selective
ala-adrenoceptor antagonist on the basis of its ability to
discriminate between ala- and alb-adrenoceptor recognition sites that have been labelled with [3h] xxxd3000xxx  (hanft
et al., 1989) and [ 3h]tamsulosin (garcfa-sfiinz et al., 1995).
this conclusion is supported by the results of sudoh et al.
(1992) who found that, after pretreatment with chlorethylclonidine of membrane fractions derived from various
rabbit tissues including the heart, [3h]tamsulosin exhibited
affinity for the remaining binding sites greater than that of
[3h] xxxd3000xxx  or [3h]wb 4101, indicating that tamsulosin
has high affinity for ata-adrenoceptors. however, it has
become evident that certain characteristics of the tamsulosin-induced antagonism are quite different from those of
the antagonism induced by other a]a-adrenoceptor antago-

289

nists. wb 4101 shifted the curve for the positive inotropic
effect of phenylephrine by 1 log unit at 1 nm, whereas it
did not cause a further shift at higher concentrations,
probably because of the predominant contribution of chbadrenoceptors in rabbit ventricular muscle (endoh et al.,
1992a). by contrast, (+)-niguldipine depressed the maximal response to al-stimulation at concentrations as low as
0.1 pm without producing a rightward shift of the concentration-response curve; this drug did not cause further
inhibition at higher concentrations (endoh et al., 1992b).
(+)-tamsulosin exhibited neither the saturation characteristics of wb 4101 nor the depression of the maximal
response observed with (+)-niguldipine, so it is clearly
different from the agents that have been previously recognized as selective antagonists of ala-adrenoceptors. in this
context, it is noteworthy that the inhibitory action of
(+)-tamsulosin was very similar to that of another a~nadrenoceptor ligand oxymetazoline (faure et al., 1994) in
respect to the mode of antagonism (schiimann and endoh,
1976) and dissociation from the accumulation of inositol
phosphate induced by phenylephrine, as will be discussed
later.
the slope of the schild plot for (5-)-tamsulosin was
close to unity in only a limited concentration range and it
became less than unity at the higher concentration, suggesting the possible involvement of more than one subtype
in the effect of phenylephrine. because rabbit ventricular
muscle contains predominantly the chlorethylclonidinesensitive am-subtype (takanashi et al., 1991), we examined the possible interference of crm-adrenoceptors, by
pretreatment with chlorethylclonidine, in the antagonistic
action of (_)-tamsulosin. pretreatment with chlorethylclonidine markedly diminished the maximal response and
elicited a rightward shift of the concentration-response
curve for phenylephrine. these results are in agreement
with previous findings in papillary muscles from the rabbit
(takanashi et al., 1991; kohi et al., 1993a) and the rat
(williamson et al., 1994). after pretreatment with 10 /zm
chlorethylclonidine, the ecs0 value for phenylephrine increased 5-fold (fig. 4). since the relationship between
occupancy of ceradrenoceptors and the positive inotropic
effect is non-linear, indicating the existence of spare receptors in rabbit papillary muscle (hiramoto et al., 1988), this
result might explain the chlorethylclonidine-induced rightward shift of the curve for phenylephrine.
chlorethylclonidine might also bind to subtypes other
than alb-adrenoceptors. in this context, current findings
imply that chlorethylclonidine is selective for a~s-adrenoceptors (han et al., 1987; minneman et al., 1988) and that
it modifies the amino acid composition of atb-adrenoce ptors but not that of a]a-adrenoceptors (terman et al.,
1990). however, it has recently been shown that chlorethylclonidine binds also to a ~d- and a~a-adrenoceptors, with
a rank order of crib > aid > a~a, when cloned adrenoceptor subtypes are examined (goetz et al., 1993). such an
effect of chiorethylclonidine might be responsible for the

290

h.-7~ yang, m. endoh / european journal ~4l'pharmacology 312 (1996) 281-291

modulation of the inhibitory action of (±)-tamsulosin in
muscle preparations that were pretreated with chlorethylclonidine (fig. 5).
after treatment of preparations with chlorethylclonidine, (_+)-tamsulosin effectively antagonized the positive
inotropic effect of phenylephrine, indicating that the antagonistic action of (_+)-tamsulosin does not involve o~madrenoceptors. michel and insel (1994) reported that (_+)tamsulosin has higher affinity for oq,- than for ce~h-adrenoceptors, whereas it has a limited ability to select between
a~a- and a~d-adrenoceptors. since recent pieces of evidence indicate that oqd mrna is present in the heart
(rokosh et al., 1994; stewart et al., 1994), different subtypes that are sensitive to (_+)-tamsulosin but not sensitive
to chlorethylclonidine might possibly contribute to the
inhibitory action of ( _+)-tamsulosin in the case of chlorethylclonidine-pretreated muscles (fig. 5). ( _+)-tamsulosin at
a concentration of 1 /zm markedly shifted the concentration-response curve for phenylephrine to the right, indicating that (±)-tamsulosin is a potent and effective ,x~aadrenoceptor antagonist in the rabbit ventricular myocard±urn. it was noted, however, in chlorethylclonidinetreated preparations that the /3-adrenoceptor-mediated effect of phenylephrine appeared in the presence of high
concentrations of (±)-tamsulosin and contributed partially
to the maintenance of the maximal response to phenylephrine, because phenylephrine had to be applied at very
high concentrations (fig. 5).
it is noteworthy that (±)-tamsulosin at concentrations
up to 1 /xm did not significantly affect the accumulation
of [3h]ip3 that was induced by stimulation of a~-adrenoceptors in rabbit ventricular myocardium. this result indicates a clear dissociation of the positive inotropic effect
from the accumulation of inositol phosphates. considering
the close correlation between the inotropic effect and the
response in terms of accumulation of inositol phosphates
during activation of c~b-adrenoceptors (takanashi et al.,
1991; yang and endoh, 1994) and the dissociative action
of (+)-tamsulosin, we are inclined to postulate that stimulation of myocardial c~la-adrenoceptors produces a positive inotropic effect independent of the accumulation of
inositol phosphates, in addition to a chlorethylclonidinesensitive positive inotropic effect associated with accumulation of inositol phosphates. the previous findings in the
rabbit ventricular myocardium that the antagonistic action
of selective cqa-adrenoceptor antagonists, such as ( + ) niguldipine (yang and endoh, 1994), hv 723 (kohi et al.,
1993b) and wb 4101 (yang and endoh, 1994), on the
positive inotropic effect of o<~-adrenoceptor stimulation
was not or was associated with only partial inhibition of
the accumulation of inositol phosphates induced by cetadrenoceptor stimulation support the above postulate of
different mechanisms that are associated with or unrelated
to the accumulation of inositol phosphates. the present
findings with another ce~a-adrenoceptor ligand oxymetazoline (faure et al., 1994), which antagonized the positive
inotropic effect of phenylephrine mediated by o~-adreno-

ceptors in a competitive manner but did not affect the
accumulation of inositol monophosphate induced by
phenylephrine, also support the postulate described above.
in these studies, the accumulation of [3h]inositol phosphates was measured in rabbit ventricular slices prelabelled with myo-[3h]inositol according to the method of
berridge et al. (1983). although accumulation of [-~h]inositol phosphates may reflect the activation of phospholipase c subsequent to c~-adrenoceptor stimulation, it has
been shown that myocardial aj-adrenoceptors are coupled
also to activation of phospholipase d (ye et al., 1994) and
phospholipase a~ (kurachi et al.. 1989). namely, activation of phospholipase d results in production of diacylglycerol, which may be shared by activation of phospholipase c. therefore, the potential involvement of various
types of phospholipase in oq-adrenoceptor-mediated regulation of myocardial contractility has to be taken into
consideration and requires future study.
in summary, we have demonstrated in rabbit ventricular
muscle that: (1) (+)-tamsulosin and oxymetazoline competitively antagonize the positive inotropic effect of
phenylephrine acting via a chlorethylclonidine-insensitive
subtype of al-adrenoceptor; (2) the functional antagonism
is not associated with inhibition of the accumulation of
inositol phosphate induced by a~-adrenoceptor stimulation;
and, thus, (3) (±)-tamsulosin and oxymetazoline cause a
clear dissociation of the positive inotropic effect from the
accumulation of inositol phosphates that is induced by
ce~-adrenoceptors.
