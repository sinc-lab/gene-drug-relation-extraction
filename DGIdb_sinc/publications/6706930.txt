tion of catalase after the reaction had plateaued showed no

degraded. fig. 8c shows results obtained when the incubation

these conditions oz evolution was greatly reduced, both in
rate and in extent. only about 8 nmol/ml of o2 were evolved,
compared to about 50 nmol/ml observed in the absence of
tyrosine (fig, 86). the much reduced 0, evolution cannot be
attributed tolack of h202,since additionof catalase after the

€or tyrosine iodination was responsible for the greatly reduced
catalatic activity, since inotherexperiments(resultsnot

almost all the iodidewas utilized for tyrosine iodination

with the results shown in fig. 7. when tyrosine was present
in the incubation mixture (fig. 8f), o2 evolution was greatly
diminished, although not quite to the low level observed with
 xxxg2320xxx  (fig. 8c). the somewhat higher level obtained with  xxxg1338xxx  is probably attributable to the
higher iodide concentration that was used with this enzyme.

effect of iodide concentration on degradation of h 2 0 2 by
 xxxg2320xxx  and  xxxg1338xxx -fig. 7 shows that
the disappearance of 100 p~ hz02from an incubation mixture
containing  xxxg2320xxx  or  xxxg1338xxx  was highly
dependent on the i- concentration. very little, if any, h,02
was degraded in the complete absence of i-. however, as little
as 1 pm i- had a definite stimulatory effect, especially with
 xxxg2320xxx . increasing concentrations of 1- resulted
in progressive increases both in the rate and the extent of
h20zdisappearance. at the highest i- concentration (100 p ~
all of the h202was degraded within 1 min in the presence of
 xxxg1338xxx , and more than 90% was degraded in a similar
period in the presence of  xxxg2320xxx . low concentrations of i- were more effective with latter, but high concentrations of i- were more effective with the former. presumably, therefore, (k& is greater for  xxxg2320xxx  but
v,,,,, is greater for  xxxg1338xxx .
only a small fraction of the h202 that disappeared from
the incubation mixture could be accounted for by oxidation
of i- to 12.this was most apparent in the samples containing
1 p~ i-. under these conditions 25 ~ l mh202was degraded by
 xxxg2320xxx  and 15 p~ h202by  xxxg1338xxx . in
samples containing 100 pm i- only about 5 pm 1, was formed
(data notshown), compared to the 90-100 pm h202 that
disappeared from the reaction mixture. utilization of h202
for i- oxidation, therefore, could not account for the disappearance of h20, observed in fig. 7 . rather, it appeared that
 xxxg2320xxx  and  xxxg1338xxx  display catalatic activity in the presence of iodide. further evidence for this was
obtained in experiments measuring 0 2 evolution, described in
the following section.

scn- in fig. 9a cannot be attributed to catalaticactivity.
since scn- has been reported (31) to be oxidized by  xxxg1338xxx  + h202, itseemed likely that the observed disappearance of h,02 could be explained by thyroid peroxidasecatalyzed oxidation of scn-.
oxidation of scn- by h20, in the presence of thyroid
peroxidase was measured both spectrophotometrically and by
examination of the reaction products of "s-labeled scnof
(results not shown). by following the absorbance (az~r)
scn- on addition of successive increments of h202,we observed that 2.7 mol of h z 0 2were required for complete oxidation of 1 mol of scn-, a result in good agreement with the
calculated value of 3.0 required for the reaction previously
reportedfor  xxxg1338xxx -catalyzedoxidation
of scn(31): 3h20, + scn- + hs0,2h20 hcn. results of
the labeling experiments showed that [35s]sulfatewas the
only labeled product of the peroxidase-catalyzed oxidation of
scn- (identified by filter paper chromatography in ethanol/
ammonium acetate).
effect of  xxxd2594xxx  on iodide-dependent catalatic actiuity
of  xxxg2320xxx -in a previous study in thislaboratory
(32) we showed that the thioureylene drug, "i,,
inhibits
 xxxg2320xxx -catalyzed iodination reversibly or irreversibly. the typeof inhibition is determinedlargely by the ratio
of iodide to drug. when this ratio is high, enzyme-catalyzed
oxidation of the drug is favored and inhibition of iodination
is reversible. however, at lower iodide to drug ratios, thyroid
peroxidase is rapidly inactivated, and inhibitionof iodination
effect of mmi
is irreversible. it was of interest to examine the
on the iodide-dependent catalatic activity of  xxxg2320xxx .
results obtained with mmi are illustrated in fig. 10. effects of 10, 25, and 50 p~ mmi were determined on h20,
disappearance (fig. 1oa) and on o2 evolution (fig. 10b) in
incubation mixtures containing 100 pm 1- and 100 pm h20,.
at the lower concentrations of mmi (10 and 25 p ~ ) all
, the
h,02 disappeared from the reaction mixture. the rate was
slower with 25 p~ than with 10 p~ mmi. both drug concentrations gave slower rates than the control sample containing
no mmi. at the highest mmi concentration (50 p ~ ) both
,
therateandtheextent
of thehz02disappearance were
markedly inhibited. under these conditions only about 25%
of the h202 disappeared
from the reaction mixture.
investigation of the effect of mmi on the catalaticactivity
to
of  xxxg2320xxx , illustrated in fig. 10b, provided information about the mechanism of the h20a disappearancedepicted in fig. 1oa. the observation that no o2 was evolved in
the presence of 50 pm mmi (curue d ) indicates that the
disappearance of about 25% of the h20, from the reaction
mixture (fig. 1oa) cannot be attributed to catalatic activity
of  xxxg2320xxx . it appeared likely, therefore, thath2oz
was utilized to oxidize mmi. this was shown to be the case
by performing the reaction in a cuvette and following the
peak absorbance of mmi
in the recording spectrophotometer(resultsnotshown).the
decreasein a,,,, corresponded to the disappearance of approximately 40 nmol/ml
of mmi. assuming that the sole oxidation product was the
disulfide of mmi, this reaction would consume 20 nmol/ml
of h202. within the limits of the experimental error of the
measurements, this could readily explain the observed disappearance of h202from the reaction mixture. parallel experiments in which enzymeactivity was followed by guaiacol

determine whether thiocyanate, like iodide, stimulates catalatic degradationof h,02 by  xxxg2320xxx  and  xxxg1338xxx . experiments were also performed with perchlorate

iodination studiesperformed as infig. 11 indicated that 50
km cbz inhibitediodination more than 95% (resultsnot

mmi (fig. 11). however, the mechanism of inhibition of
iodination was different. cbz inhibited iodination competitively by utilizing the h202for its own oxidation. however,

periment, we would observe a lag in iodination comparable to
that seen in fig. 10b. accordingly, experiments were performed under the conditionsused in fig. 10b, except that an
iodine acceptor (bovine  xxxg124xxx ) was added to the
reaction mixture. the results are shown in fig. 11. a lag in
iodination was observed, which compared very well with that
seen in the oxygraph experiments. with 25 im mmi, iodination was completely inhibited for 30 s, agreeing very closely
with the lag in catalatic activity shown infig. 10b. with 10
pm mmi, iodinationwas greatly inhibitedat 15 s, corresponding closely to the approximately 10-s
lag observed forcatalatic
activity. both iodination and catalatic activity were irreversibly inhibited by 50 pm mmi, presumably because the thyroid
peroxidase was inactivated under these conditions(32).
effect of  xxxd435xxx  on h 2 0 pdegradation and catalatic
actioity- xxxd435xxx  is a derivative of mmi, which, unlike
mmi, does not readily inactivate  xxxg2320xxx . as described in a previous communication (32), it acts as a purely
reversible inhibitor of  xxxg2320xxx -catalyzed iodination. it was of interest, therefore, to compare its effectswith
those of mmi described in the preceding section. fig. 12a
shows the effect of 50 pm cbz on h,02 degradation in a
reaction mixture containing 100 ~ l mh,o, and either 0 , 25, or
100 fm i-. all of the h,o, was degraded in the presence of
both concentrations of iodide, but the rate was much faster
with 100 pm i-. under the latter conditions all of the h,o,
disappeared within 3 min. these results contrast with those
for mmi, which, under similar conditions, showed the disappearance of only 25% of the h202(fig. 1oa). the effects of
50 fm cbz on catalatic activity areshown in fig. 12b. in the
absence of i-, no catalatic activity was observed, and subsequent addition of catalase resulted in evolution of 50 pm o,,
indicatingthatnone
of the h20, had beendegraded (in
agreement with the results in fig. 12a). in the presence of
100 fm i- there was likewise no catalatic activity of thyroid
peroxidase (fig. 12b). however, in this case there was no o2
evolution on subsequent addition of catalase, indicating that
all the h,on had beenutilized to oxidize the cbz. these
results also contrast with those observed with mmi under
similar conditions (fig. 10b).
further evidence for a difference in mechanism between
cbz and mmi was obtainedinthe
following experiment
(results not shown). in the presence
of 100 pm h,02 and 100

discussion

h,o,.
catalatic activity was established by demonstrating thato2
is readily evolved from h,o, by  xxxg2320xxx  and  xxxg1338xxx . this activity, however, was completely iodidedependent. the pseudohalide, thiocyanate, could not replace
iodide, although thiocyanate itself was readily oxidized by
h,o, in the presence of the peroxidases. the observation of
the iodide-dependent catalatic activity of  xxxg2320xxx 
and  xxxg1338xxx  explains our inability to obtaina ratio of
1.0 for moles of i bound per mol of h 2 0 n utilized in the
peroxidase-catalyzed iodination reactions.
the distinction between peroxidases and catalase is generally based on the manner in
which they utilize h202.catalase
catalyzes therapiddegradation
of h202to form oxygen.
peroxidases catalyze the utilizationof h20zfor the oxidation
of a donor compound. thomas et al. (36) showed that chloroperoxidase, a mold enzyme, displays significant catalatic activity and that it bridges some of the classicaldifferences
between enzymes of the peroxidase and catalase type. the
catalatic activity of chloroperoxidase was observed both in

the mechanism of  xxxg2320xxx - and lactoperoxidasecatalyzed iodination of tyrosine andtyrosyl residuesin protein
has been discussed by various investigators. mechanisms involving an iodine free radical (2, 8, 9), iodinium ion, (13-15,
34, 3 5 ) , or hypoiodite (1, 10) have been proposed. according
to all these schemes it would be expected that 1 mol of hz02
is requiredfororganic
binding of 1 mol of iodide. in the
present study we examined the stoichiometric relationship
betweenorganiciodine
formationand h20, utilizationin
iodination reactions catalyzed by  xxxg2320xxx  and  xxxg1338xxx . iodination of tyrosine, bovine  xxxg124xxx ,
or low iodine thyroglobulin was carried out under conditions
where h,o, was limiting. the h202was either generatedwith
glucose-glucose oxidase or added as a bolus. with generated
h,o, the ratio,moles of iodide bound per mol of h202utilized,
although close to unity, was always less than 1.0 (generally
about 0.9). similar ratios were observed with low levels of
,
at higher concentrations
directly added h,02 (5-10 p ~ ) but
of h,o, (100 fm) the ratio declined to less than 0.5. despite
the low ratio, it was observed that all the h20, disappeared
from the reaction mixture, indicating that h202was utilized
in some reaction other than iodination. this raised the possibility that  xxxg2320xxx  and  xxxg1338xxx  possess
catalase-like activity, resulting in unproductive
cleavage of

the presence and in theabsence of c1-. the ph optimumfor
the halide-independent reaction (4.5) was greater than that
for the halide-dependent reaction (2.75). subsequent studies
by manthey and hager ( 3 7 ) demonstrated that bromoperoxidase, isolatedfrom a marine alga, also catalyzedthe evolution
of o2 from h202.significant activity was observed at ph 6.8
in theabsence of halide, but the activity
was greatly enhanced
in the presenceof 100 mm br-. in the present studywe have
shown that  xxxg2320xxx  and  xxxg1338xxx  display
significant catalatic activity. this activity, in contrast to that
of chloroperoxidase and bromoperoxidase, is completely halide-dependent. a possible catalatic activity of  xxxg2320xxx  was briefly reported by ohtaki et al. (13, 14), but no
mention was made of an iodide requirement.
to elucidate the mechanism of the iodide-dependent catalatic activity, we have made use of previously reported (32,
38) inhibitors of  xxxg2320xxx - and lactoperoxidasecatalyzed iodination. following is a summary of observations
made in this and in our previous study (i), which led to the
development of a general scheme showing how the iodidedependent catalatic activity may relate to the various peroxidative functions of these enzymes (see below).
1 )  xxxg2320xxx  and  xxxg1338xxx  exhibit marked
catalatic activity in the presence of iodide, based both on
measurements of h,o, disappearance and o2 evolution. in
theabsence of iodide, the enzymescatalyze neither h20,
disappearance nor 0, evolution.
2) the presence of only 1 ~ l mi- in an incubation mixture
containing 100 p m h,02and 1.3 pg/ml of  xxxg2320xxx 
resulted in the degradation of 25 pm h20z (fig. 7). clearly,
therefore, oxidation of i- to i, could not stoichiometrically
account for the disappearance of the h202,and it appeared
the i- must be catalytically involved in theenzymatic reaction
leading to h20, disappearance. in samples containing100 fm
i- it was possible to measure i2 formed in the reaction, and
again it was evident that oxidation of i- to is was much too
small to account for the measured disappearance of h202.
oxidation of iodide to iodate was negligible, as shown in our
previous study (1).
3) the pseudohalogen, scn”, cannot replace i- as a promoter of catalatic activity, even though scn- is readily oxidized by h20, f  xxxg2320xxx  or  xxxg1338xxx . as
shown in fig. 9, h20, was degraded in the presence of scn-,
but no evolution of o2 accompanied the reaction. in thiscase
h202was utilized solely for the oxidation of the anion, in
contrast to the catalatic
cleavage of h20, that occurred in the
presence of i-. another anion, cloj-, which competes with 1for a transport system in the thyroid,also had no stimulatory
effect onthecatalatic
activity of  xxxg2320xxx  and
 xxxg1338xxx  (fig. 9). unlike scn-, c104- is not oxidized
by the peroxidase system.
4) the thioureylenedrug, mmi, was shown in previous
studiesinthislaboratorytoactbothas
a reversible and
irreversible inhibitor of  xxxg2320xxx - and  xxxg1338xxx -catalyzed iodination,and a scheme was proposed to
explain its mechanism of action (32). in the present studywe
examinedthe effects of mmionthecatalatic
activity of
 xxxg2320xxx , and we observed that this reaction may
also be inhibited reversibly or irreversibly bymmi, depending
ontheconcentration
of drug (fig. 10). moreover, inthe
presence of concentrations of mmi leading to reversible inhibition, a time lag was observed which corresponded closely
inextenttothetime
lag seenin iodination experiments
performed under similar conditions (figs. 10 and 11).
5) the thioureylenedrug, cbz, is a derivative of mmi, but,
unlike mmi, it does not readily inactivate thyroidperoxidase.
