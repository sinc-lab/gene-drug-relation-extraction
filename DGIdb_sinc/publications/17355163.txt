abstract

 xxxd3559xxx  is a specific ace inhibitor with antihypertensive, remarkable antioxidant, and cardioprotective
properties, including the ability to improve endothelial function and protect against ischemia. these beneficial
properties of  xxxd3559xxx  are believed to be due primarily to the presence of a sulfhydryl group and the highly
lipophilic nature of the agent. as a potent, long-acting ace inhibitor with tissue selectivity, it is a useful agent
for the treatment of a number of cardiovascular diseases. ace inhibitors block the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone
system (raas) and are recommended in the management of hypertension with associated risk factors because
of their renoprotective and cardioprotective effects. there is a robust body of comparative data supporting
 xxxd3559xxx  as an effective and well tolerated ace inhibitor for treating hypertension. hypertensive patients
frequently require combination therapy to adequately control bp. ace inhibitors combined with a diuretic make
a very effective combination, as a result of the synergistic mechanisms of these two drug classes that allow good
efficacy and favorable tolerability at low doses. the combination of  xxxd3559xxx  and hydrochlorothiazide is
effective and superior to monotherapy with either agent. clinical studies have demonstrated that early administration of  xxxd3559xxx  in patients with acute myocardial infarction is effective and well tolerated for reducing the
incidence of major cardiovascular events in at-risk patients, and it is believed that much of the benefit is a result
of the primary cardioprotective effect of  xxxd3559xxx .

 xxxd3559xxx  ( xxxd3559xxx ®)1 is a prodrug ester that, once absorbed,
undergoes rapid, complete biotransformation to the active metabolite  xxxd3560xxx .[1,2]  xxxd3559xxx  combines specific inhibition of
1

angiotensin converting enzyme (ace) with antioxidant properties,
and both these mechanisms contribute to its clinical efficacy in the
treatment of hypertension and improving prognosis for patients

following myocardial infarction (mi).[3] the chemical structure of
 xxxd3559xxx  includes a sulfhydryl moiety, a feature shared with only
one other ace inhibitor, captopril. ace inhibition has been found
to be related to the degree of lipophilicity, and  xxxd3559xxx  is
notably lipophilic.[4] the high lipophilicity allows  xxxd3559xxx  to
undergo extensive and prolonged tissue penetration, which enhances ace inhibition in tissues. importantly, concentrations of
 xxxd3559xxx  in the heart and aortic wall have been found to be
greater than plasma concentrations, and penetration of cardiac
tissue by  xxxd3559xxx  is particularly efficient.[4]
 xxxd3559xxx  is a highly potent, long-acting, and tissue-selective
ace inhibitor with ancillary antioxidant and cardioprotective
properties that make it desirable for the treatment of hypertension
and mi. hypertension predisposes to a number of cardiovascular
diseases, and even small reductions in bp can substantially reduce
cardiovascular risk.[5,6] this review discusses the role of  xxxd3559xxx 
in the management of hypertension and acute mi.
1. renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors
in hypertension
the pivotal role of  xxxg99xxx  in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular disease (figure 1) has led to the development of pharmacologic agents that target the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (raas), such as  xxxg99xxx  receptor antagonists (blockers) [arbs] and ace inhibitors.[7]
ace inhibitors block the conversion of  xxxg99xxx  to  xxxg99xxx  (figure 1) and have reno- and cardioprotective effects in
addition to antihypertensive activity.[7,8] the cardioprotective effects of ace inhibitors in secondary prevention have been estabat i

lished in the landmark hope (heart outcomes prevention evaluation)[9] and europa (european trial on reduction of cardiac
events with perindopril in stable coronary artery disease) studies,[10-13] in which ace inhibitors were associated with significant
reductions in the primary cardiovascular endpoints including mi,
stroke, and cardiovascular mortality. these findings have prompted recommendations that all patients with stable cardiovascular
disease or diabetes mellitus with one additional risk factor should
receive ace-inhibitor therapy. while there is mounting evidence
to support the notion that the protective effects of ace inhibitors
in these studies are a class effect, this has not yet been established
definitively. the lipophilic nature of ramipril and perindopril has
been implicated as a leading contributing factor to their reno- and
cardioprotective effects. the cardio- and renoprotective properties
of ace inhibitors make them an excellent option for front-line
pharmacologic management of hypertension in patients with associated risk factors. reduced bp with ace-inhibitor monotherapy
is reported in 35–70% of patients, and this class of agents is
associated with few metabolic adverse effects.[14,15]
2.  xxxd3559xxx  in hypertension: robust
comparative studies
there is a robust body of comparative data supporting  xxxd3559xxx  as an effective and well tolerated ace inhibitor for the
treatment of mild to moderate essential hypertension. in a dosefinding study, patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension were randomized to receive 6 weeks’ treatment with  xxxd3559xxx  7.5mg (n = 42), 15mg (n = 39), 30mg (n = 44) or 60mg
(n = 42), or placebo (n = 42) once daily.[16]  xxxd3559xxx  dosages
≥15 mg/day significantly lowered 24-hour ambulatory sbp and
dbp compared with placebo. the changes in dbp for  xxxd3559xxx 
and placebo recipients are shown in table i.  xxxd3559xxx  30 and
60 mg/day yielded the most significantly superior bp lowering
results. other supporting data come from  xxxd3559xxx  monotherapy
arms of studies investigating combination therapies (see section
2.2.1).

 xxxd3559xxx  in hypertension and mi

2.1 comparison with other antihypertensive classes

one of the first randomized, comparative, placebo-controlled
studies investigated the antihypertensive effects of 12 weeks’
treatment with  xxxd3559xxx  30mg (n = 19) or hydrochlorothiazide
25mg (n = 19) once daily in patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension.[17] both  xxxd3559xxx  and hydrochlorothiazide
were equally effective versus placebo in reducing office bp;
mean office bp was 137/89mm hg with  xxxd3559xxx  versus 151/
98mm hg with placebo (p < 0.001) and 139/89mm hg with hydrochlorothiazide versus 154/100mm hg with placebo
(p < 0.001). however, ambulatory monitoring between 0800 and
2200 hours revealed that  xxxd3559xxx  exhibited superior efficacy
compared with hydrochlorothiazide at certain times of the day
(dbp in the afternoon and sbp in the evening). tolerability data
showed only mild, transient adverse events and no significant
changes in laboratory parameters. furthermore, small dosages of
 xxxd3559xxx  were found to be effective in reducing bp without any
deleterious effects on lipoprotein profiles, which have been seen
with higher dosages.[18] therapeutic equivalence between  xxxd3559xxx  and amlodipine has been demonstrated in a randomized trial
involving 303 patients with mild to moderate hypertension who
received once-daily treatment with  xxxd3559xxx  30mg or amlodipine
5mg.[19] although the difference was not significant, after 12
weeks’ treatment, 58% of  xxxd3559xxx  and 62.5% of amlodipine
recipients had a dbp ≤90mm hg or a ≥10mm hg reduction compared with baseline.
 xxxd3559xxx  30–60 mg/day and atenolol 50–100 mg/day reduced
bp to a similar extent in >300 patients with mild to moderate
hypertension treated for 12 weeks. seated sbp decreased
12.6mm hg and 13.9mm hg (nonsignificant differences) with
 xxxd3559xxx  and atenolol, respectively.[1] therapeutic equivalence
has also been shown for  xxxd3559xxx  30–60 mg/day and enalapril
20–40 mg/day in mild to moderate hypertension. treatment for 12
weeks resulted in reductions in supine dbp of 15.2mm hg with
 xxxd3559xxx  and 15.4mm hg with enalapril. a 12-week, randomized, multicenter study compared the antihypertensive effect of
 xxxd3559xxx  30–60 mg/day (n = 114) and candesartan 8–16 mg/day
(n = 122) in patients with grade i–ii essential hypertension.[20] in
the intention-to-treat population, office sbp and dbp reductions
were similar for the two treatment groups ( xxxd3559xxx  21 ± 11/
15 ± 8mm hg and candesartan 20 ± 11/15 ± 7mm hg). the investigators concluded that  xxxd3559xxx  represents a treatment as effective and as well tolerated as candesartan in patients with grade i–ii
essential hypertension (no significant difference in the number or

distribution of adverse effects between the two treatment groups:
candesartan 8;  xxxd3559xxx  10).
2.2 combination antihypertensive therapy

only about 50% of patients with hypertension respond to
treatment with a single antihypertensive agent, and the goal bp of
<140/90mm hg is achieved with monotherapy in only about onequarter of patients with hypertension in france and the us.[14,21-23]
disproportionate increases in adverse effects are often associated
with increasing dosages to improve response. combination therapy with two or more agents from different antihypertensive drug
classes selected on a rational basis (see table ii) typically results in
response rates of >70%. consequently, most guidelines for the
management of hypertension recommend combination therapy,
particularly when bp control with initial monotherapy is inadequate.[24-26] beginning pharmacologic management of bp with
combination therapy is often advised for patients with stage ii
hypertension when nonpharmacologic interventions are ineffective or stage i hypertensive patients with comorbid diabetes mellitus or coronary heart disease. european guidelines for hypertension state that the choice of low-dose monotherapy or combination
therapy should be based on untreated bp measurements, and the
absence or presence of target organ damage and risk factors.
antihypertensive combination therapy commonly includes a diuretic combined with an ace inhibitor or agent from another class.
response rates of >80% in patients with mild to moderate
hypertension treated with an ace inhibitor/diuretic combination
have been reported.[22] this high response rate can be attributed to
the synergistic, contrasting effects on the raas.[14,23] stimulation
of the raas as a result of diuretic-induced low sodium levels
increases the antihypertensive activity of ace inhibitors, and
ace inhibitors block the production of  xxxg99xxx , which is
associated with reducing the antihypertensive activity of diuretics.
conditions are therefore created for the ace inhibitor to function
with its maximum antihypertensive effect, and the efficacy of the
diuretic does not become diminished over time. because of this

synergy, the dosages of each agent needed to achieve adequate bp
control with such a combination are less than those required in
monotherapy, resulting in favorable tolerability. also, metabolic
adverse effects often associated with thiazide diuretic monotherapy are offset by ace inhibition.
2.2.1 combining  xxxd3559xxx  with hydrochlorothiazide

the lipophilicity of  xxxd3559xxx  may confer favorable pharmacokinetic characteristics when the agent is administered in conjunction with hydrochlorothiazide. for example, in a recent study
in rats with mi, coadministration of  xxxd3559xxx  and hydrochlorothiazide produced increased  xxxd3559xxx  concentrations in tissue but
not plasma; in comparison, hydrochlorothiazide increased the
concentration of hydrophilic lisinopril in plasma but not tissue.[28]
the combination of  xxxd3559xxx  and hydrochlorothiazide has
been shown to be effective for the treatment of hypertension in
clinical studies, and has also been shown to be superior to
monotherapy with either agent. in a randomized, double-blind
trial, patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension received once-daily treatment with hydrochlorothiazide 12.5mg
(n = 113),  xxxd3559xxx  30mg (n = 115), or combination therapy with
hydrochlorothiazide 12.5mg plus  xxxd3559xxx  30mg (n = 235).[29]
monotherapy resulted in significant reductions in both sbp and
dbp after 12 weeks of treatment, but the reductions for combination therapy were significantly greater than those for either
monotherapy. the dbp response rate of <90mm hg or a reduction
of ≤10mm hg from baseline was also significantly greater in
patients who received combination therapy than in those who
received monotherapy. in a separate study by the same investigators,[29] patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension
received 4 weeks’ treatment with  xxxd3559xxx  30mg once daily.
nonresponders at 4 weeks were then randomized to continue to
receive  xxxd3559xxx  monotherapy at the same dosage or  xxxd3559xxx 
30 mg/day plus hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg/day for a further 8
weeks. while bp decreased by 5/8mm hg in the nonresponders
who continued monotherapy, more consistent reductions of 7/
10mm hg were reported among the patients who switched to
combination therapy. furthermore, the reduction in bp plateaued
at 6 weeks with  xxxd3559xxx  monotherapy, but continued to decrease
over the entire study period with combination therapy.
a recent randomized, double-blind, multicenter trial compared
the effects of monotherapy with  xxxd3559xxx  15, 30, or 60 mg/day or
hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 or 25 mg/day and combination therapy
with  xxxd3559xxx  plus hydrochlorothiazide on office and 24-hour
ambulatory bp in 353 patients.[30] in general, combination regimens provided better reduction in office and ambulatory bp

measurements and greater response rates than monotherapy. regimens that included hydrochlorothiazide 12.5mg appeared to have
a greater effect, with statistical significance attained more often.
moreover, the greatest sbp and dbp smoothness indices (a measure of the distribution of bp reduction over 24 hours) were
associated with these combinations (1.6/1.8 and 1.9/2.5 for the
hydrochlorothiazide plus  xxxd3559xxx  30 mg/day and 60 mg/day
regimens, respectively), indicating that bp control with combination therapy was usually more homogenous over 24 hours than
monotherapy.  xxxd3559xxx  30 mg/day plus hydrochlorothiazide
12.5 mg/day had the most favorable benefit to hazard ratio. six
patients withdrew because of adverse events, and all but one
adverse event resolved following treatment discontinuation. no
single adverse event leading to treatment discontinuation in both
studies resulted in discontinuation for >1% of patients in the
combination therapy arms.[31] at present, there are no long-term
data on the safety of combination therapy with  xxxd3559xxx  and
hydrochlorothiazide.
a fixed-dose combination of  xxxd3559xxx  30mg and hydrochlorothiazide 12.5mg has been approved for once-daily use in
the management of mild to moderate hypertension in several
countries of the eu.[30]
3. the antioxidant effect of  xxxd3559xxx 
the sulfhydryl moiety of  xxxd3559xxx  is reported to ‘scavenge’
oxygen-free radicals and stimulate  xxxd2738xxx  (no) release.[1,32]
both these effects are considered to be potentially vascular and
tissue protective. the ability of  xxxd3559xxx  to ‘scavenge’ oxygenfree radicals has been seen at both cardiac and vascular levels, and
probably contributes to many of the agent’s actions. the antioxidant activity of  xxxd3559xxx  is clinically relevant in patients with
essential hypertension. the significantly enhanced susceptibility
of low-density lipoprotein (ldl) to oxidation and greater systemic oxidative stress observed in essential hypertension patients was
found to be significantly ameliorated and the no pathway improved after 12 weeks’ treatment with  xxxd3559xxx  15–30 mg/day in
a randomized, controlled trial.[33] in this study, plasma indices of
oxidative stress and the no/asymmetrical  xxxd1379xxx 
(adma) balance were initially investigated in untreated
normocholesterolemic patients with moderate essential hypertension (n = 96) and a control group of normotensive subjects
(n = 46). thereafter, patients with hypertension were randomized
to receive  xxxd3559xxx  (n = 48). results showed that measures of
ldl peroxidation were significantly reduced by 12 weeks’ treatment with  xxxd3559xxx  (figure 2). the antioxidant effect of zofeam j cardiovasc drugs 2007; 7 (1)

nopril was also demonstrated by using isoprostane measurements.
figure 3 shows that plasma levels of isoprostanes were normalized
following  xxxd3559xxx  therapy. currently, no such in vivo data in
hypertensive patients for the other ace inhibitors exist.
it has been clearly demonstrated that the antioxidant properties
of  xxxd3559xxx  are a result of the sulfhydryl moiety.[32] in cultured
endothelial cells exposed to a system that causes free radicalinduced lipid peroxidation and cellular injury, preincubation with
 xxxd3559xxx  at concentrations as low as 10 mumol/l significantly
improved cell viability.[34]  xxxd3560xxx  also confers significant
dose-dependent reductions in several effects induced by oxidized
ldl and  xxxg2296xxx  in human umbilical vein endothelial cells including: (i) intracellular reactive oxygen species; (ii)
formation of superoxides; (iii) consumption of intracellular glutathione; (iv) expression of vascular and intercellular cell adhesion
molecules and  xxxg2048xxx ; and (v) activation of nuclear factorkappab.[35] moreover, it was found that the intracellular  xxxd3559xxx 
concentrations and penetration correlated with the antioxidant
activity.  xxxd3559xxx  also improved no production and bioactivity
and decreased endothelial cell oxidant stress in bovine aortic
endothelial cells.[36]
two in vivo studies have investigated the antioxidant effects of
 xxxd3559xxx  in animal models of atherosclerosis.[37,38] in zofenopriltreated watanabe heritable hyperlipidemic rabbits, plaque formation, ldl oxidation, native ldl and oxidized ldl levels, macrophage foam cell counts, platelet adherence, and activation at the
site of atherosclerotic lesions were all reduced compared with
placebo.[38] administration of  xxxd3559xxx  for 6 months to genetically modified mice significantly reduced atherosclerotic lesions and
concurrently reduced the oxidation status of the aorta.[37] zofe© 2007 adis data information bv. all rights reserved.

nopril also potentiates the vasodilator effects of bradykinin in
isolated rat hearts.[32,39,40] it is believed that, similar to other ace
inhibitors,  xxxd3559xxx  may cause coronary vasodilatation by
bradykinin-mediated release of no, which is enhanced in the
presence of free sulfhydryl groups. therefore, sulfhydryl ace
inhibitors may potentiate the therapeutic effects of nitrates and
reverse tolerance to them.
the effects of  xxxd3559xxx  in ischemia/reperfusion models are
well established, and are independent of hemodynamic
changes.[32,41] during reperfusion,  xxxd3560xxx  improves contractile force and coronary flow, attenuates oxidative stress, and
reduces end-diastolic pressure and lactate dehydrogenase, creatinine kinase and norepinephrine (noradrenaline) release, while
maintaining mitochondrial calcium homeostasis and phosphorylation capacity.  xxxd3559xxx  1–100 mumol/l significantly reduced
infarct size in isolated rat hearts subjected to ischemia for 30
minutes followed by reperfusion for 2 hours.[42] the investigators
concluded that that the cardioprotective properties of  xxxd3559xxx 
may be a result of interference with bradykinin metabolism and/or
preservation of protein sulfhydryl groups. left ventricular relaxation has also been found to be enhanced by  xxxd3559xxx  in isolated
guinea pig hearts.[43]
4. benefits in acute myocardial infarction: a good
way to evaluate cardioprotective properties
of  xxxd3559xxx 
chronic heart failure can ensue following acute mi, largely as
the result of early activation of the raas system.[3] myocardial
injury can also result in left ventricular dysfunction. ace inhibitors prevent the onset and progression of left ventricular dysfunc8-isopgf2alpha (pmol/mmol creatinine)

tion by reducing the left ventricular loading condition and limiting
myocardial hypertrophy. improved clinical outcomes in patients
with acute mi treated with ace inhibitors have been demonstrated.[44,45] ace inhibitors limit the expansion of the infarct zone in
mi in the short-term, thereby reducing intraventricular stress.
long-term ace inhibitors reduce ventricular dilatation and hypertrophy of the non-necrotic myocardial tissues.
early administration of  xxxd3559xxx  to patients with acute mi has
been found to be effective and well tolerated in reducing the
incidence of major cardiovascular events in at-risk patients.
guidelines issued by the who[46] and the french cardiac society
(fcs)[44,45] recommend that long-term treatment with ace inhibitors be considered for high-risk patients, such as those who present
with clinical heart failure or altered systolic left ventricular function. in mi patients with comorbid hypertension, the addition of a
calcium channel antagonist or low-dose diuretic may be considered.
the smile-i trial evaluated the effects of early administration
of  xxxd3559xxx  in reducing major cardiovascular events in the short
and long term in patients with acute anterior mi who were not
eligible for thrombolytic therapy.[47] patients were randomized to
receive 6 weeks’ treatment with either placebo (n = 784) or  xxxd3559xxx  7.5mg twice daily initially, with the dosage doubled to a
maximum of 60mg twice daily provided that sbp remained at
>100mm hg (n = 772); the target dosage was achieved in 78.8%
and 86.1% of patients receiving  xxxd3559xxx  and placebo, respectively. during the 6 weeks of treatment, the incidence of severe
congestive heart failure (chf) or death was significantly lower
among the  xxxd3559xxx  recipients than the placebo recipients (figure
4). the cumulative reduction in risk of severe chf and death was
34% (95% ci 8, 54), and this was due mainly to a reduced risk of

severe chf of 46% (95% ci 11, 71). there was a numerical, but
not statistically significant, reduction in risk of death from all
causes of 22% (95% ci –12, 48; p = 0.19) among the  xxxd3559xxx 
recipients and this was almost entirely attributable to the 22%
(95% ci –8, 53) reduction in risk of mortality due to cardiovascular causes. furthermore, the 1-year mortality rate was significantly
(p = 0.011) lower with  xxxd3559xxx  than with placebo (10% vs
14.1%). the reduction in absolute mortality risk with  xxxd3559xxx  at
1 year corresponded to one life saved for every 24 patients treated.
treatment withdrawal, mainly as a result of hypotension, was
reported in 8.6% and 6.8% of patients receiving  xxxd3559xxx  and
placebo, respectively, in the smile study.[47] the investigators
postulated that much of the benefit for patients with acute mi seen
with  xxxd3559xxx  therapy is the result of a primary cardioprotective
effect as well as the rapid blockade of the deleterious effects
associated with neurohumoral activation. the beneficial findings
associated with  xxxd3559xxx  in the smile study were also highlighted in the expert consensus document on angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors in cardiovascular diseases.[48]
 xxxd3559xxx  is currently indicated for the treatment initiated
within the first 24 hours of patients with acute mi with or without
signs and symptoms of heart failure, who are hemodynamically
stable and have not received thrombolytic therapy.
according to data from placebo-controlled studies presented in
the fcs guidelines,  xxxd3559xxx  is one of the most effective ace
inhibitors in terms of reducing mortality in mi patients.[44,45] the
number of lives saved by treating 100 mi patients for 1 year with
 xxxd3559xxx , ramipril, captopril, and  xxxd3409xxx , were 4.1, 4.6, 1.2,
and 2.4, respectively.[44,45]

ace inhibitors are the preferred treatment for hypertensive
patients with associated risk factors, such as stable cardiovascular
disease or diabetes mellitus, largely as a result of the additional
reno- and cardioprotective effects associated with this class of
antihypertensives.  xxxd3559xxx  is a highly lipophilic ace inhibitor,
with good tissue penetration and long duration of action that has
specific antioxidant and cardioprotective properties as well as the
ability to improve endothelial function as a result of the presence
of a sulfhydryl moiety. these properties explain its excellent
efficacy in the treatment of hypertension and postinfarction and,
furthermore, there is a robust body of comparative data supporting
such use of  xxxd3559xxx  in patients with acute mi.
