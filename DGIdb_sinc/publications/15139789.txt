1. pharmacodynamic properties

 xxxd2834xxx 

cancer chemotherapy is almost invariably associated with some degree of nausea and vomiting
(emesis), with an incidence as high as >99% in
patients treated with cisplatin.[1] chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (cinv) are two of the
most distressing and often debilitating adverse effects from a patient’s perspective[2-5] and, long after
the availability of effective antiemetics, still figure
among the top three in the list of patient fears from
chemotherapy.[6] cinv cause several medical and
psychological complications in cancer patients that
may significantly affect quality of life, adherence to
anticancer therapy and survival.[2,5,7] consequently,
antiemetic therapy has become an integral part of
supportive care in the management of cancer patients.[1,2,8]
of the various pharmacotherapy options available, corticosteroids and serotonin  xxxg1116xxx 
antagonists are the most widely used antiemetic
agents, and all have high therapeutic indices.[1] the
already established  xxxg1116xxx  antagonists (e.g.
ondansetron, granisetron,  xxxd1924xxx ) are now generally accepted as being similar in terms of their
antiemetic efficacy and tolerability.[1,2,8] these
agents are effective in preventing the acute phase of
cinv. however, they have reduced efficacy in the
prevention of delayed cinv,[2,9] for which corticosteroids alone (low-risk emetogenic agent) or in
combination with other agents (moderate-to-high
risk) are recommended.[1-3]
 xxxd2834xxx  ( xxxd2834xxx ™,  xxxd2834xxx ®)1, a new 5-ht3
receptor antagonist with high potency and selectivity and a prolonged half-life, has shown excellent
antiemetic efficacy against cinv during acute and

●  xxxd2834xxx  is a highly selective, competitive,
high-affinity antagonist of the  xxxg1116xxx .[10]
the negative logarithm of the inhibitory constant
(pki) for the drug was 10.4 using [3h]-quizapine as
a radioligand in ng108-15 cells, with low affinities
(pki all <6.0) for 28 other receptors including other
serotonin subtypes.[10] similarly,  xxxd2834xxx  also
lacked activity at several ion channels.[10]
● the affinity of  xxxd2834xxx  for the  xxxg1116xxx  (pki >10) was higher than that of all other known
 xxxg1116xxx  ligands tested, including ondansetron (pki = 8.4) and  xxxd3451xxx  (pki = 8.7), in
saturation binding studies in ng108-15 cells.[10]
● parenteral  xxxd2834xxx  dose-dependently inhibited 2-methyl serotonin-induced bradycardia associated with the von bezold-jarisch reflex in rats.[11]
intraduodenal or intravenous  xxxd2834xxx  was up to
15 times more potent than granisetron and up to 55
times more potent than ondansetron in inhibiting the
von bezold-jarisch reflex.[11]
● oral or intravenous  xxxd2834xxx  produced dosedependent inhibition of emetic episodes induced by
cisplatin,  xxxd1796xxx ,  xxxd1800xxx  or  xxxd2551xxx  in animal models, with a potency 2–93 times
higher than that of ondansetron or granisetron.[11]
● importantly, a complete inhibition of the emetic
response was seen against three of the four
emetogens in the oral dosage range (1–100 mug/kg)
tested in dogs, with the dose required for complete
inhibition being at least ten times lower for  xxxd2834xxx  than that for ondansetron.[11] against cisplatin-induced emesis, the duration of antiemetic
effect of  xxxd2834xxx  (30 mug/kg orally) was 7 hours
compared with 4 hours for that of an equieffective
dose of ondansetron (300 mug/kg orally).[11]

 xxxd2834xxx : adis drug profile

2. pharmacokinetic properties
the pharmacokinetic properties of  xxxd2834xxx 
(intravenous[12-15] or oral[12,13]) have been evaluated
in several studies in healthy volunteers (five studies
available in a single poster[12] or abstracts[13,14]) and
a dose-ranging study in cancer patients (fully published) [see section 3].[15] additional information
has been taken from the us prescribing information.[16] discussion focuses on the pharmacokinetic
profile of intravenous  xxxd2834xxx  in cancer patients. the pharmacokinetic parameters in these patients[15] were generally similar to those in healthy
volunteers.[12]
absorption and distribution
●  xxxd2834xxx  exhibited linear, dose-proportional
pharmacokinetics over the dose range 1–90 mug/kg in
healthy subjects[12] and in patients with cancer.[15] in
cancer patients receiving single intravenous doses of
 xxxd2834xxx  in this dose range, the mean maximum
plasma concentration (cmax) ranged from 0.89 to
336 ng/ml and the area under the plasma concentration-time curve from zero to infinity (auc∞) ranged
from 13.8 to 957 ng • h/ml.
● in six cancer patients,[15] the mean cmax and
auc∞ values were 5.6 ng/ml and 35.8 ng • h/ml
after a single intravenous dose of  xxxd2834xxx 
3 mug/kg (equivalent to a fixed dose of 0.21mg for a
70kg adult; see section 5).[16]
●  xxxd2834xxx  is moderately bound to plasma proteins (62%).[12] the volume of distribution of  xxxd2834xxx  was approximately 8.3 l/kg after administration of a single intravenous dose of 10 mug/kg.[12]
● following intravenous administration,  xxxd2834xxx  follows a biexponential pharmacokinetic profile, with an initial rapid distribution phase followed
by a slower elimination phase.[12,15]

ht3 receptor antagonists (<1% of the activity of
 xxxd2834xxx ).[16]
● in in vitro studies,[16]  xxxd2834xxx  was metabolised primarily by cytochrome p450 (cyp) 2d6 and,
to a lesser extent, by  xxxg590xxx  and cyp1a2.[16] however, clinical pharmacokinetic studies showed no
difference in the metabolism of  xxxd2834xxx  between poor and extensive metabolisers of cyp2d6
substrates.[16]
● within 144 hours of administration of a single
intravenous dose of  xxxd2834xxx  10 mug/kg, approximately 80% of the dose was recovered in the urine,
half of which was unchanged drug (40% of the
dose).[16] the total body and renal clearance of  xxxd2834xxx  were 160 and 66.5 ml/h/kg in healthy
subjects.[16] slow elimination of  xxxd2834xxx  from
the body results in a long terminal elimination halflife of ≈40 hours.[14,16]
special populations

age, hepatic dysfunction or mild-to-moderate
renal impairment have no clinically significant effect on the pharmacokinetics of  xxxd2834xxx ,[16]
although total systemic exposure increases by 28%
in patients with severe renal impairment compared
with that in healthy subjects.[16]
●

drug interactions
● the potential for drug interactions with  xxxd2834xxx  appears to be low, because the drug does
not interact with any other clinically important cyp
isoenzyme.[16] there was no significant pharmacokinetic interaction following concomitant administration of single-dose  xxxd2834xxx  (0.75mg intravenously) with steady-state metoclopramide (10mg
four times daily orally) in healthy volunteers.[16]

3. therapeutic efficacy
metabolism and elimination

approximately 50% of an intravenously administered dose of  xxxd2834xxx  is metabolised in the
liver via multiple routes.[13,14,16] the two primary
metabolites, n-oxide- xxxd2834xxx  and 6-(s)-hydroxy- xxxd2834xxx , are essentially inactive as 5●

the efficacy of single doses of intravenously
administered  xxxd2834xxx  in preventing cinv has
been evaluated in three randomised, double-blind,
parallel group, multicentre phase iii clinical trials in
adult patients (≥18 years) with malignant disease.[17-20]
drugs 2004; 64 (10)

1128

patients naive or non-naive to chemotherapy with
a karnofsky index ≥50%[17,18] or ≥60%[20] were randomised to receive a single, fixed dose of one of the
antiemetic agents. the drugs were administered
intravenously over 30 seconds ( xxxd2834xxx [17,18,20]
and  xxxd1924xxx [18]) or over 15 minutes (ondansetron)[17,20] 30 minutes prior to administration of the
primary chemotherapeutic agent. at the discretion
of the investigator, a single dose of a corticosteroid
administered before chemotherapy[18,20] and/or rescue medication for the treatment of nausea and
emesis after chemotherapy[17,18,20] was permitted.
patient diaries were used to record emetic episodes,
use of rescue medication, severity of nausea, patient
satisfaction and the impact of nausea and emesis on
daily functioning and quality of life.[17,18,20]
exclusion criteria included the use of drug(s)
with antiemetic properties from 24 hours before to 5
days after treatment, emesis or national cancer
institute common toxicity criteria grade 2 or 3
nausea within 24 hours preceding chemotherapy,
and baseline corrected qt (qtc) >500ms.[17,18,20]
the primary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of patients with a complete response (no emetic
episode, no use of rescue medication) during the
first 24 hours after chemotherapy administration
(acute phase).[17,18,20] secondary endpoints included
the proportion of patients with a complete response
during the delayed (24–120 hours; days 2–5) and the
overall (0–120 hours; days 1–5) phases, and the
proportion of patients with complete control (defined as no emetic episode, no need for rescue
medication and no more than mild nausea). data
regarding the severity of nausea, patient satisfaction
and quality of life in these patients have not been
published to date. an intent-to-treat analysis was
performed for all efficacy evaluations.[17,18,20]
while standard doses of ondansetron (32mg) and
 xxxd1924xxx  (100mg) were used, the doses of  xxxd2834xxx  (0.25 and 0.75mg) were based on the results of a randomised, double-blind, dose-ranging
study.[15] in this phase ii study (n = 161), complete
response rates were 46% or 40% with  xxxd2834xxx 
3 or 10 mug/kg (approximately corresponding to fixed
doses of 0.25 and 0.75mg) during the 24-hour period

after highly emetogenic chemotherapy that included
cisplatin >70 mg/m2 and cyclophosphamide >1100
mg/m2.[15]
in addition to the above trials, a noncomparative
trial (n = 875)[21] has evaluated the efficacy of intravenous  xxxd2834xxx  0.75mg in preventing cinv
with repeated cycles of moderately or highly
emetogenic chemotherapy in patients who had earlier participated in one of the phase iii trials.[17,18,20]
results of this trial have indicated that the efficacy
of  xxxd2834xxx  0.75mg, with or without concomitant corticosteroids, was generally maintained over
repeated cycles (up to four) of chemotherapy in
acute, delayed and overall phases (complete response rates ≥55%, >58% and >45%, respectively).[21]
moderately emetogenic chemotherapy

two double-blind trials (n = 563[17] and 569[18])
have compared  xxxd2834xxx  (0.25 and 0.75mg)
with ondansetron 32mg[17] or  xxxd1924xxx  100mg[18]
in preventing cinv in patients receiving moderately emetogenic agents, including methotrexate
>250 mg/m2, cyclophosphamide <1500 mg/m2,
doxorubicin >25 mg/m2, cisplatin ≤50 mg/m2 or any
dose of carboplatin. in these trials, 42%[17] and
67%[18] of patients were naive to chemotherapy, and
a majority (72%[17] and 82%[18]) were female, with
an even distribution across the treatment groups.
only 5% of patients received corticosteroids in the
trial that allowed their concomitant use.[18] efficacy
criteria required  xxxd2834xxx  to show non-inferiority to the comparators at a 97.5% confidence level
and a maximum delta of 15%.[17,18]
complete response

recipients of single intravenous doses of  xxxd2834xxx  0.25 or 0.75mg consistently achieved high
complete response rates during the acute phase
(0–24 hours) after moderately emetogenic chemotherapy (primary endpoint) [figure 1].[17,18]
● the complete response rate in acute phase in
patients receiving  xxxd2834xxx  0.25mg was significantly higher than that in ondansetron 32mg recipients[17] and similar to that in  xxxd1924xxx  100mg

plete response rate in acute phase between  xxxd2834xxx  (0.25 and 0.75mg) and the comparators were
greater than the preset threshold of –15%, indicating
that both doses of  xxxd2834xxx  were non-inferior to
ondansetron[17] or  xxxd1924xxx .[18]
● the efficacy of  xxxd2834xxx  against nausea/emesis induced by moderately emetogenic agents was
maintained during the delayed phase (24–120 hours)
[secondary endpoint].[17,18]  xxxd2834xxx  0.25mg
was significantly more effective than ondansetron
32mg[17] or  xxxd1924xxx  100mg[18] in preventing
delayed cinv (figure 1). complete response rate
with  xxxd2834xxx  0.75mg was similar to that with
ondansetron 32mg[17] and significantly higher than
that with  xxxd1924xxx  100mg.[18]
● during the overall phase (0–120 hours), complete response rates with  xxxd2834xxx  0.25mg were
significantly higher than those observed with ondansetron 32mg (69% vs 50%; p < 0.001)[17] or  xxxd1924xxx  100mg (46% vs 34%; p = 0.021);[18] complete
response rates in the respective  xxxd2834xxx 
0.75mg groups were 59%[17] and 47% (p = 0.012 vs
 xxxd1924xxx ).[18]

in general, other secondary endpoints showed
that  xxxd2834xxx  was at least as effective as ondansetron or  xxxd1924xxx .[17,18] for example, although
there were no between-group differences in complete control rates during the acute phase, these rates
were significantly (all p ≤ 0.03) higher during the
delayed and overall phases with  xxxd2834xxx  0.25
or 0.75mg (42–67%) than with comparators
(31–50%).[17,18]
● there were also significantly fewer emetic episodes with  xxxd2834xxx  0.25mg than with ondansetron 32mg (all p ≤ 0.05)[17] or  xxxd1924xxx  100mg (all
p < 0.02) during acute, delayed and overall
phases.[18]  xxxd2834xxx  0.75mg was more effective
than  xxxd1924xxx  100mg[18] during delayed and overall phases only (p < 0.002 for both) [quantitative
data not reported].
● the antiemetic effect of single doses of  xxxd2834xxx  (0.25 or 0.75mg) persisted for >120 hours,

highly emetogenic chemotherapy

a single phase iii trial (n = 667) has evaluated
the efficacy of  xxxd2834xxx  in preventing cinv
with highly emetogenic chemotherapy, including
cisplatin ≥60 mg/m2, cyclophosphamide >1500
mg/m2 and  xxxd1796xxx .[19,20] the efficacy criteria
required  xxxd2834xxx  to show non-inferiority to

confidence level and a maximum delta of 15%.[20]
● during the first 24 hours (acute phase) following

(0.25 and 0.75mg) and ondansetron was above the
preset threshold of –15%, thus showing non-inferiority of both doses of  xxxd2834xxx  to ondansetron.[20]
● in patients receiving concomitant corticosteroids
(≈67% in each group),[22] a complete response
during the acute phase was seen in 65% and 56% of
patients treated with  xxxd2834xxx  0.25mg or ondansetron 32mg.
● the complete response rate during the delayed
phase was >45% with  xxxd2834xxx  (0.25 or
0.75mg), with either dose being similar to ondansetron 32mg in producing a complete response (figure
2).[20]
● compared with ondansetron 32mg, the median
time to first emetic episode was significantly longer
with  xxxd2834xxx  0.25 or 0.75mg (42.7 vs >120
hours for each  xxxd2834xxx  dose; both p < 0.03),[19]
and the number of emetic episodes during the acute
phase was significantly lower with  xxxd2834xxx 
0.75mg (p = 0.008) [data not reported].[20]
4. tolerability
●  xxxd2834xxx , administered as single intravenous
doses prior to chemotherapy, was generally well
tolerated in patients receiving moderately[17,18] or
highly[15,19] emetogenic chemotherapy in the clinical
trials discussed in section 3. as expected in cancer
patients undergoing chemotherapy, who have a high
rate of complications and comorbid illness, the incidence of adverse events was high (up to 67% with
 xxxd2834xxx  0.75mg in one trial[17]) and ascertaining their causality was difficult. however, most
adverse events were mild in intensity (up to 84%)[17]
and/or unrelated to  xxxd2834xxx  treatment
(>80%).[18]
● in general, adverse events with  xxxd2834xxx 
were similar in nature, frequency, duration and intensity to those of the comparator agents.[17-19,22]
among the adverse events judged by the investigators as at least possibly treatment related or with
cause unknown, headache and constipation were the
most frequent in all treatment groups across all
trials.[15,17,18,22] figure 3 summarises adverse events
reported by ≥2% of patients in any treatment group

pooled data[16] on adverse events (occurring in ≥2% of patients in any treatment group) at least possibly related to the antiemetic therapy or
with cause unknown that was reported in four randomised, double-blind, parallel-group, multicentre clinical trials in patients receiving
moderately[17,18] or highly[15,19] emetogenic chemotherapy. patients were given a single dose of one of the antiemetic agents intravenously
30 minutes before administration of the primary chemotherapeutic agent (see section 3 for further details).

in a pooled analysis of data from these trials that is
reported in the us prescribing information. only
headache (9%) and constipation (5%) occurred with
an incidence of ≥2% in  xxxd2834xxx  0.25mg recipients.[16]
● serious adverse events occurred with low
(≤5%)[17,18] and similar frequency in  xxxd2834xxx 
and comparator groups.[17,18] none of the serious
events was assessed as being related to the study
medication.[17,18] two patients discontinued treatment due to adverse events: one non-serious, treatment related ( xxxd2834xxx  0.75mg group), the other
serious, not treatment related (ondansetron 32mg
group).[17] no other treatment discontinuations were
reported in  xxxd2834xxx  clinical trials.
● no significant treatment-related abnormalities in
laboratory values or ecg recordings were observed,
and  xxxd2834xxx  was similar to the comparators
with respect to these parameters.[17,18] importantly,
the increases from baseline in qtc (fridericia correction) interval with  xxxd2834xxx  0.25 or 0.75mg
(1–3.4ms) were nonsignificant and were similar to
those seen with ondansetron ( xxxd1405xxx ) or  xxxd1924xxx 
(5.4ms).[17,18]
● results of a large, noncomparative trial (section
3)[21] showed that  xxxd2834xxx  0.75mg administered prior to repeated cycles of chemotherapy was

well tolerated, with no unexpected treatment-related
adverse events occurring in the later cycles.
5. dosage and administration
in the us, the recommended dosage of  xxxd2834xxx  for the prevention of cinv is 0.25mg administered as a single, 30-second intravenous infusion
approximately 30 minutes before the start of chemotherapy.[16]
6.  xxxd2834xxx : current status
 xxxd2834xxx  is the first, and currently the only,
 xxxg1116xxx  antagonist approved for the prevention of delayed cinv with initial and repeat courses
of moderately emetogenic chemotherapy in the
us.[23] it is also approved for the prevention of acute
cinv caused by initial and repeat courses of moderately or highly emetogenic agents.  xxxd2834xxx  has
recently been included in the antiemesis guidelines
of the national comprehensive cancer network as
the preferred 5-ht3 antagonist in patients receiving
moderately emetogenic chemotherapy.[3] in clinical
trials,  xxxd2834xxx  0.25 or 0.75mg was similar to or
more effective than the comparator  xxxg1116xxx 
antagonists in preventing cinv with moderately or
