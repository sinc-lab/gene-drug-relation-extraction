abstract: blockade of the renin–angiotensin system is an important approach in managing
high blood pressure, and has increasingly been shown to affect cardiovascular disease processes
mediated by  xxxg99xxx  throughout the cardiovascular and renal continua.  xxxd3303xxx  is an
 xxxg99xxx  receptor blocker (arb) displaying unique pharmacologic properties, including
a longer half life than any other arb, that result in large and sustained reductions of blood
pressure. in patients with mild-to-moderate hypertension,  xxxd3303xxx  has proved superior
to other antihypertensive agents ( xxxd3487xxx , losartan, ramipril, perindopril, and atenolol) in
controlling blood pressure particularly towards the end of the dosing interval. there is also
clinical evidence that  xxxd3303xxx  reduces left ventricular hypertrophy, reduces arterial stiffness
and the recurrence of atrial fibrillation, and confers renoprotection. the ongoing  xxxd3303xxx 
alone and in combination with ramipril global endpoint trial (ontarget®) study has
demonstrated that  xxxd3303xxx  has similar cardiovascular protective effects to ramipril in a
large, high-risk patient population but was better tolerated. the powerful and sustained blood
pressure control apparent in clinical trials, together with cardiovascular protection and tolerability demonstrated in ontarget® means that  xxxd3303xxx  may be a preferred option for
patients with hypertension.
keywords:  xxxg99xxx  receptor blocker, cardiovascular disease, hypertension, renin–
angiotensin system,  xxxd3303xxx 

 xxxg99xxx , which is generated by the renin–angiotensin system (ras), plays a
pivotal role in hypertension and cardiovascular disease. thus, pharmacologic regulation of  xxxg99xxx  is central to the control of blood pressure and prevention of
its pathophysiologic effects on the cardiovascular system, including the kidney and
the brain.
the  xxxg36xxx  (ace) inhibitors target one of the enzymes
that generate  xxxg99xxx  from  xxxg99xxx  (figure 1). however,  xxxg99xxx  is
not produced exclusively by this mechanism; other enzymes, such as chymase, are
also able to generate  xxxg99xxx .1 the  xxxg99xxx  receptor blockers (arbs)
overcome the detrimental effects of  xxxg99xxx  by preventing it binding to the
type 1 receptors (at1). this review examines evidence for the efficacy of  xxxd3303xxx 
in the treatment of high blood pressure, and explores the body of the evidence that
 xxxd3303xxx  prevents disease mediated by  xxxg99xxx  throughout the cardiovascular
and renal continua.

pharmacology of  xxxd3303xxx 
there are currently seven commercially available arbs, with
 xxxd3303xxx  offering unique pharmacologic features compared
with the other agents of its class.  xxxd3303xxx  displays insurmountable, but reversible binding to the  xxxg100xxx , and
it has the highest binding affinity for this receptor among
commercially available arbs.2 as well as providing longterm blockade of the  xxxg100xxx ,  xxxd3303xxx  has minimal
affinity for the  xxxg101xxx  (k  10,000 nm) or for acetylcholine, catecholamine, dopamine, histamine, serotonin, or
imipramine receptors.3  xxxd3303xxx  is also highly lipophilic,
which facilitates oral absorption and benefits tissue and
cell penetration, as demonstrated by its large volume of
distribution of approximately 500 l,4,5 thereby blocking
both systemic and local ras. unlike other arbs, which
are excreted to varying extents via the kidneys,6,7 more than
90% of  xxxd3303xxx  is eliminated in the feces.8 an important
distinguishing feature of  xxxd3303xxx  is its long terminal elimination half-life of about 24 hours, suggesting a long duration
of action.5 it has been shown in healthy volunteers that, at
peak plasma concentrations,  xxxd3303xxx  80 mg reduces the
response to exogenous  xxxg99xxx  by about 90%, and
approximately 40% inhibition persists for 24 hours.9
 xxxd3303xxx  modulates peroxisome proliferator-activated
receptor gamma ( xxxg1807xxx ), an established therapeutic target in the
treatment of insulin resistance, diabetes, and metabolic
syndrome.10 it has effects that are characteristic of  xxxg1807xxx 
ligands on metabolism.11–14 in addition, there is a growing

body of evidence that  xxxg1807xxx  activation raises adiponectin
production and exerts anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidative and
anti-proliferative effects on vascular walls, thus decreasing
the risks for atherosclerosis.15,16 although  xxxg1807xxx  activation
has been reported for other commercially available
arbs,17–19 the effects on  xxxg1807xxx  activity have been shown
to be considerably weaker than achieved with  xxxd3303xxx 
and occur at much higher concentrations.19,20 thus, the
unique  xxxg1807xxx -inducing properties of  xxxd3303xxx , which are
achievable at therapeutic doses, may have the capacity for
targeting both diabetes and cardiovascular disease.

the importance of sustained blood
pressure control
hypertension is well recognized as a major risk factor
for cardiovascular and renal morbidity and mortality. the
importance of blood pressure lowering has been established
through epidemiologic and clinical studies, and has led to
a broad consensus from guideline bodies on the targets for
blood pressure control. improved control of blood pressure is
vital to obtain maximum benefit.
patients typically prefer to take their medication in
the morning. to optimize patient compliance, oncedaily dosing is important. however, for a once-daily
drug taken in the morning, early morning is the time of
trough efficacy and may pose a problem in the management of hypertension. in one study, approximately 60%
of patients with apparently controlled hypertension when

measured in the office during the day had, in reality,
uncontrolled blood pressure (systolic blood pressure [sbp]/
diastolic blood pressure [dbp]  130/85 mmhg) determined
by ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (abpm) in the
early morning.21 an antihypertensive agent’s duration of
action must be sufficient to control blood throughout the
dosing interval and, ideally, if the next dose is delayed or
missed.22
a further consideration is that, during the morning,
incidences of cardiovascular events increase dramatically and
are more frequent than at any other time of the day.23–25 blood
pressure follows a circadian rhythm, being lowest at night
and increasing suddenly in the morning upon awakening.26
this early morning blood pressure surge (embps) is caused
primarily by orthostatic changes but is also linked to circadian
changes in the ras.27–29

antihypertensive efficacy
of  xxxd3303xxx 
the efficacy of  xxxd3303xxx  in the primary care setting has
recently been demonstrated in the  xxxd3303xxx ® community
access trial (miccat-2) involving 1619 patients.30 the
patients had uncontrolled hypertension, 675 having blood
pressure that was not controlled despite prior receipt of
conventional therapy. the patients in the trial were treated
with  xxxd3303xxx  40 mg, titrated to 80 mg or a combination of
 xxxd3303xxx  80 mg plus hydrochlorothiazide ( xxxd2294xxx ) 12.5 mg.
office sbp/dbp fell by 22.7/12.6 mmhg in the previously
untreated patients and by 16.8/10.3 mmhg in the previously
treated patients. after  xxxd3303xxx  treatment, blood pressure
was controlled in 79% of the patients.
an accurate reflection of the extent of blood pressure
control at different stages of the dosing interval is provided by
self-measurement of blood pressure in the home or by 24-hour
abpm using an automated device.31 in miccat-2, abpm
showed that  xxxd3303xxx  alone or in combination with  xxxd2294xxx 
produced significant reductions in blood pressure as shown in
both day-time and night-time mean sbp/dbp. furthermore,
 xxxd3303xxx  reduced sbp/dbp by 17.2/10.1 mmhg in the
4 hours post-awakening in the 95 patients who had an
embps of sbp  30 mmhg.32
a large number of clinical studies have demonstrated
the antihypertensive efficacy of  xxxd3303xxx  versus other
antihypertensive agents. key studies, as described below,
are summarized in table 1. it should be noted that relative
efficacy in fixed-dose studies depends upon the doses
employed, which typically related to the doses approved or
intended for clinical practice when the study was conducted.

vascular health and risk management 2010:6

 xxxd3303xxx  in hypertension and cardiovascular risk management

results should be interpreted with caution in cases where the
doses employed are less than the current, clinically-available
maximal dose.

 xxxd3303xxx  versus other arbs
in japanese hypertensive patients, home blood pressure
measurement confirmed that  xxxd3303xxx  reduces blood
pressure more than other arbs.33 at the lower doses typically
used in japan, once-daily  xxxd3303xxx  10 to 40 mg taken in
the morning achieved greater blood pressure reductions in
the early morning than once-daily  xxxd3487xxx  40 to 80 mg,
candesartan 2 to 12 mg, or losartan 25 to 100 mg. comparison
of the morning effect on blood pressure versus the evening
effect on blood pressure showed that, in particular, the effect
of losartan did not persist for 24 hours.
ambulatory blood pressure monitoring has shown that
 xxxd3303xxx  80 mg confers significantly greater blood pressure lowering than several other arbs. when compared
with  xxxd3487xxx  160 mg,  xxxd3303xxx  provided sustained antihypertensive efficacy and superior control of blood pressure
during the early morning period.34,35 differences between the
treatments were also apparent for seated sbp. this measure
was significantly reduced by  xxxd3303xxx  compared with
 xxxd3487xxx  (12.1 vs 8.2 mmhg, respectively; p = 0.0281),
while the reduction in dbp was also numerically greater
with  xxxd3303xxx .35 pooled data from two studies showed that,
after active therapy, last 6-hour mean dbp was reduced by
7.6 mmhg with  xxxd3303xxx  compared with 5.8 mmhg with
 xxxd3487xxx  (p = 0.0044) and last 6-hour mean sbp was reduced
by 11.1 mmhg with  xxxd3303xxx  as opposed to 9.1 mmhg
with  xxxd3487xxx  (p = 0.0066).35 after a dose was deliberately
missed, 24-hour mean dbp was reduced by 7.2 mmhg
with  xxxd3303xxx  compared with 5.5 mmhg with  xxxd3487xxx 
(p = 0.0004), and the reduction in 24-hour mean sbp after a
missed dose was 10.7 mmhg with  xxxd3303xxx  and 8.7 mmhg
with  xxxd3487xxx  (p = 0.0024).
similarly, 3 abpm studies comparing  xxxd3303xxx  40 or
80 mg with losartan 50 or 100 mg demonstrated that  xxxd3303xxx  provided greater reductions than losartan in both the
24-hour mean sbp and dbp and in the in last 6 hours of
the dosing interval.36–38
there are fewer data comparing the antihypertensive
efficacy of  xxxd3303xxx  with arbs other than  xxxd3487xxx  and
losartan. a 1-year comparative study in patients with mild
hypertension and type 2 diabetes showed that  xxxd3303xxx 
produced a superior reduction in blood pressure compared
with eprosartan.39 two small-scale clinical studies have
compared the blood pressure lowering effects of  xxxd3303xxx

40 mg versus olmesartan 20 mg in japanese patients.
in one open-label study of 20 patients with early-stage
type 2 diabetes and hypertension, olmesartan was shown to
provide greater blood pressure reductions than  xxxd3303xxx .40
conversely, in a separate study,  xxxd3303xxx  was shown to
be more effective than olmesartan for controlling early
morning blood pressure, in addition to improving glucose
and cholesterol levels in patients with hypertension, chronic
heart failure and metabolic syndrome.41 a pubmed search
identified no clinical trials directly comparing the antihypertensive effects of  xxxd3303xxx  versus irbesartan.

 xxxd3303xxx  versus ace inhibitors
other evidence for  xxxd3303xxx  providing effective blood
pressure control comes from two 14-week studies of identical design – prospective, randomized investigation of the
safety and efficacy of  xxxd3303xxx ® versus ramipril using
abpm (prisma™) – conducted in 1613 hypertensive
patients in europe and south africa (prisma™ i) and
in the usa and canada (prisma™ ii). in prisma™ i,
 xxxd3303xxx  titrated from 40 to 80 mg and given in the morning provided superior blood pressure control than ramipril
titrated from 2.5 to 5 to 10 mg.42 notably, this difference
was observed throughout all periods of the 24-hour dosing
interval and resulted in significantly greater reduction in
sbp/dbp than ramipril during the last 6 hours (p  0.001).42
similar results were recorded in prisma™ ii.43 the pooled
analysis of the prisma™ i and ii trials documented that 24-h
mean sbp/dbp reductions were significantly greater with
 xxxd3303xxx  than ramipril (-14.1/-9.6 vs -11.1/-7.2, respectively) and superiority of  xxxd3303xxx  over ramipril was also
apparent during the last 6 hours (difference: 4.8/3.3 mmhg
(p  0.0001)).44 furthermore, the findings of a meta-analysis
of individual data from 1 million patients in 61 prospective studies suggest that the statistically significant greater
reduction in last 6-hour mean sbp in patients treated with
 xxxd3303xxx  in the prisma™ studies is of clinical relevance
in improving long-term prognosis.45
the antihypertensive effect of  xxxd3303xxx  was examined
in a double-blind comparison of  xxxd3303xxx  80 mg and perindopril 4 mg. both agents produced similar reductions in
24-hour mean sbp/dbp at the end of the 8-week study.46
however,  xxxd3303xxx  provided significantly greater reductions in hourly mean dbp in each of the last 8 hours of
the dosing period.  xxxd3303xxx  40 mg was also compared
with perindopril 4 mg in a 12-week, open-label study, with
the dose being doubled in patients who failed to respond
(dbp  90 mmhg) at week 6.47 reductions in trough

sbp/dbp from baseline were significantly greater with
 xxxd3303xxx  at both 6 and 12 weeks.
using both 24-hour abpm and clinic blood pressure
measurements,  xxxd3303xxx  80 mg was found to be as effective
as lisinopril 20 mg in reducing sbp and dbp, with  xxxd3303xxx  provide sustained blood pressure control throughout
the 24-hour dosing interval.48 higher doses of  xxxd3303xxx 
(40, 80, and 160 mg) and lisinopril (10, 20, and 40 mg)
were compared in another, larger titration-to-response study
measuring trough clinic blood pressure and comprising
578 patients who could also receive  xxxd2294xxx  up to a dose of
25 mg.49 control of dbp was similar in patients receiving
either  xxxd3303xxx  or lisinopril.
as well as  xxxd3303xxx  generally producing greater
reductions in sbp and dbp that were particularly evident
towards the end of the dosing period,  xxxd3303xxx  is better
tolerated than ace inhibitors. comparative studies have
consistently shown that incidences of cough were lower
with  xxxd3303xxx  than with perindopril, 46,47 lisinopril, 49
or ramipril.42,43 the ongoing  xxxd3303xxx  alone and in combination with ramipril global endpoint trial (ontarget®)
study, which was an outcome study in a broad cross-section
of patients who were at high risk for cardiovascular diseases
and who could tolerate ace inhibitors, the rates of cough
and angioedema were significantly lower with  xxxd3303xxx 
than with ramipril.50 moreover,  xxxd3303xxx  was associated
with better tolerability and greater treatment adherence. the
differences in tolerability and adherence between  xxxd3303xxx 
and ramipril may well have implications for patients who need
long-term treatment to reduce their cardiovascular risk.

 xxxd3303xxx  versus beta (beta)-blockers
beta-blockers have been compared with  xxxd3303xxx  in
several studies of short or longer duration. in a titration-toresponse study of 533 patients (with  xxxd2294xxx  added as needed
to achieve blood pressure control; mean baseline seated
bp 165.8/101.8 mmhg), full sbp response (89 mmhg
and/or 10% reduction from baseline) was achieved by
84% of  xxxd3303xxx -treated patients and 78% of atenololtreated patients (nonsignificant).51 in addition, 80% achieved
a 10 mmhg reduction in trough sbp with  xxxd3303xxx 
40 to 80 to 120 mg compared with only 68% of patients
receiving atenolol 50 to 100 mg (p = 0.003).51 in addition,
 xxxd3303xxx  had the advantage of being better tolerated: over
the 26-week study, side effects were experienced by 53% of
patients receiving  xxxd3303xxx  but by 61% of those treated
with the beta-blocker. most notably, there were fewer incidences
of fatigue and male impotence. the superiority of  xxxd3303xxx

was also demonstrated in an 8-week open-label comparison
of  xxxd3303xxx  80 mg and atenolol 50 mg in 58 patients.52
 xxxd3303xxx  was compared with carvedilol in a multicenter
study on their effects on left ventricular mass (lvm) in
patients with mild-to-moderate hypertension.53 as part of the
study, abpm was performed at baseline and after 44 weeks’
treatment with  xxxd3303xxx  80 mg or carvedilol 25 mg in
82 patients. the 24-hour mean sbp/dbp reductions were
similar in both treatment groups. however, night-time and last
6-hour mean reductions were numerically greater with  xxxd3303xxx , although statistical significance was not achieved.

 xxxd3303xxx  versus calcium
channel blockers
when  xxxd3303xxx  40 mg (titrated to 80 mg at 4 weeks
and to 120 mg at 8 weeks for patients whose dbp
remained 90 mmhg) and amlodipine 5 mg (5 mg at
4 weeks to 10 mg at 8 weeks for patients whose dbp
remained 90 mmhg)54 were compared, abpm demonstrated
that both agents produced similar, significant decreases in
24-hour mean sbp/dbp (p  0.0001).  xxxd3303xxx , however,
was superior to amlodipine with respect to the reductions in
dbp at night and during the early morning hours: reduction
in dbp in the last 4 hours of the dosing interval was
3.4 mmhg greater with  xxxd3303xxx  than with amlodipine
(p  0.05). in addition, a 24-hour mean dbp  85 mmhg
were observed in 71% of  xxxd3303xxx -treated patients but
only in 55% of those receiving amlodipine.  xxxd3303xxx 
was also better tolerated: the incidence of adverse events,
particularly edema, was lower with  xxxd3303xxx  (5%) than
with amlodipine (22%; p = 0.05).
another 12-month study, primarily designed to evaluate
left ventricular hypertrophy (lvh), compared the antihypertensive efficacy of  xxxd3303xxx  40 mg with that of nifedipine
gastrointestinal therapeutic system (gits) 20 mg.55 similar
and significant reductions from baseline in sbp/dbp were
observed in the two treatment arms.

 xxxd3303xxx  versus  xxxd2294xxx 
 xxxd3303xxx  has been shown to provide more effective
control of high blood pressure than  xxxd2294xxx . in an 8-week
factorial study comparing  xxxd3303xxx  (20, 40, 80, or 160 mg),
3 doses of  xxxd2294xxx  (6.25, 12.5, or 25 mg) and combinations
of these doses,  xxxd3303xxx  40 and 80 mg resulted in greater
reductions in sbp and dbp than  xxxd2294xxx  12.5 mg.56
in a 12-month study to determine the effect of  xxxd3303xxx  and  xxxd2294xxx  on lvh in hypertensive patients, 24-hour
abpm was performed at baseline and after 12 months’

vascular health and risk management 2010:6

 xxxd3303xxx  in hypertension and cardiovascular risk management

double-blind treatment with  xxxd3303xxx  80 mg or  xxxd2294xxx 
25 mg.57 at the end of the study, significant reductions from
baseline in 24-hour mean sbp/dbp were detected in both
treatment groups, but the blood pressure-lowering effect of
24/13 mmhg with  xxxd3303xxx  versus 10/8 mmhg with  xxxd2294xxx 
was significantly superior (p  0.01).
another study was performed in 1039 patients with isolated
systolic hypertension.58 trough office sbp was reduced
by 15.6 mmhg and 17.9 mmhg in the  xxxd3303xxx  40 and
80 mg arms after 6 weeks, respectively. this lowering was
similar to that of 15.7 mmhg recorded with  xxxd2294xxx  12.5 mg.
however, significantly more patients achieved the target
reduction in sbp (140 mmhg or 20 mmhg reduction)
with  xxxd3303xxx  80 mg than with  xxxd2294xxx  12.5 mg (p = 0.03).

combination treatment in difficult-totreat patients and high-risk populations
blood pressure in some patients is ineffectively controlled
with monotherapy, and they require a combination of antihypertensive agents to achieve target blood pressure. the
combination of  xxxd3303xxx  and  xxxd2294xxx  has been shown to
provide greater reductions in blood pressure than either component alone. after a 4-week, placebo run-in period, patients
were randomized to receive placebo,  xxxd3303xxx  20, 40, 80 or
160 mg/day,  xxxd2294xxx  6.25, 12.5 or 25 mg/day, or one of 12 combinations of the two agents in a trial involving 818 patients
with mild-to-moderate hypertension.56 the analysis focused
on two combinations:  xxxd3303xxx  40 mg/ xxxd2294xxx  12.5 mg and
 xxxd3303xxx  80 mg/ xxxd2294xxx  12.5 mg. after 8 weeks,  xxxd3303xxx 
80 mg/ xxxd2294xxx  12.5 mg significantly reduced mean supine
trough blood pressures by 23.9/14.9 mmhg compared
with placebo, which represented a 8.5/3.4 mm hg greater
decrease than that achieved with  xxxd3303xxx  80 mg alone
and a 17.0/7.7 mmhg greater decrease than  xxxd2294xxx  12.5 mg
alone (both p  0.01). there was a significant reduction in
sbp of 18.8 mmhg with  xxxd3303xxx  40 mg/ xxxd2294xxx  12.5 mg
compared with placebo, and this decrease was significantly
greater than that achieved with either monotherapy.
data from two studies evaluating the combination of
 xxxd3303xxx  and  xxxd2294xxx  showed that it produced significantly
greater sbp and dbp reductions in the last 6 hours of the dosing interval compared with  xxxd2294xxx .59 two studies of
identical design have also shown that the fixed-dose combination of  xxxd3303xxx  80 mg/ xxxd2294xxx  25 mg lowered trough blood
pressure to a greater extent than  xxxd3487xxx  160 mg/ xxxd2294xxx 
25 mg in patients with stages 1 and 2 hypertension. 60,61
in a comparison of  xxxd3303xxx  80 mg/ xxxd2294xxx  12.5 mg with

combination gave a greater reduction in 24-h blood pressure,
and this difference was also seen in daytime and night-time
blood pressure values.62
there have been several studies that have investigated
the combination of  xxxd3303xxx  and  xxxd2294xxx  in patients whose
blood pressure is not adequately controlled by  xxxd3303xxx 
alone. in one such study, patients whose dbp remained
above 90 mmhg after 8 weeks of treatment with  xxxd3303xxx 
80 mg were randomized to  xxxd3303xxx  80 mg or  xxxd3303xxx  80 mg/ xxxd2294xxx  12.5 mg for a further 8 weeks.63 greater
reductions in blood pressure were achieved with the combination, such that blood pressure had been normalized (defined
as sbp  140 mmhg and dbp  90 mmhg) in 41.5% of
patients receiving the combination versus 26.1% of patients
receiving monotherapy.
patients who are at a particular risk of cardiovascular
disease include those who are obese or have type 2 diabetes.
it often proves especially difficult to achieve the rigorous
control of blood pressure required in these patients. superior
blood pressure lowering of  xxxd3303xxx  80 mg plus  xxxd2294xxx 
12.5 mg, compared with  xxxd3487xxx  160 mg/ xxxd2294xxx  12.5 mg
over 24 hours and during the early morning hours was demonstrated in the study of  xxxd3303xxx ® on obese/overweight
type 2 diabetics with hypertension (smooth®).64
the elderly, another group in which it can be difficult to
achieve satisfactory blood pressure control, were recruited
into athos® (a comparison of  xxxd3303xxx  plus  xxxd2294xxx  with
amlodipine plus  xxxd2294xxx  in older patients with predominantly
systolic hypertension). in 1000 patients (60 years) with
isolated systolic hypertension,  xxxd3303xxx  40 to 80 mg plus
 xxxd2294xxx  12.5 mg was compared with amlodipine 5 to 10 mg
plus  xxxd2294xxx  12.5 mg.65 although there was no significant
difference between the two groups in the change from
baseline in sbp during the last 6 hours of the dosing interval (which was the primary end point),  xxxd3303xxx / xxxd2294xxx 
resulted in significantly greater reductions in 24-hours,
morning and daytime sbp than amlodipine/ xxxd2294xxx . the
athos study indicates that the combination of  xxxd3303xxx 
plus  xxxd2294xxx  provides effective blood pressure control in
elderly patients.
a common finding of these studies was that the placebolike tolerability profile of  xxxd3303xxx  was maintained when
it was given in combination with  xxxd2294xxx . in an analysis of
50 trials involving 16,416 patients, the overall incidence
of adverse events was low and similar between  xxxd3303xxx 
monotherapy and the  xxxd3303xxx / xxxd2294xxx  combination.66
the combination of  xxxd3303xxx  has also
been demonstrated to provide more powerful reductions in

blood pressure than monotherapy with either  xxxd3303xxx 
or amlodipine.67 in a factorial design study, patients with
stage 1 or 2 hypertension received placebo,  xxxd3303xxx 
(20 to 80 mg), amlodipine (2.5 to 10 mg) or a combination
of the two agents. the reductions in the in-clinic dbp and
sbp observed with the combinations of most clinical interest
(40 or 80 mg plus amlodipine 5 or 10 mg) were all significant.
the greatest overall reductions (-26.4/-20.1 mmhg) were
achieved with the  xxxd3303xxx  80 mg/amlodipine 10 mg
combination. this was also associated with the greatest
response rates and blood pressure control. in the study, the
treatments were well tolerated and, notably, the high incidence
of edema with amlodipine 10 mg monotherapy (17.8%)
was reduced by 37% to 65% when  xxxd3303xxx  was used in
combination.68 therefore, the combination of  xxxd3303xxx  and
amlodipine represents a treatment option that delivers large
reductions in blood pressure and thereby likely reducing
the risk of cardiovascular events.

cardiovascular protective effects
of  xxxd3303xxx 
the concept of the cardiovascular and renal continua was
introduced to explain the pathologic processes connecting
risk factors to clinical events of increasing severity and ultimately resulting in end-organ damage and death (figure 2).
hypertension is one such risk factor. there is a large body of
evidence, from ex vivo and in vivo studies to demonstrate that
modulation of the ras with arbs and ace inhibitors interferes with several of the pathophysiological mechanisms that
lead to target organ damage (tod), which, if uncontrolled,
can be life-threatening.
the cardioprotective properties of arbs have yet to be
determined for all agents in this class and direct comparisons on the effects of arbs on target organ protection are
sparse. furthermore, within-class comparisons are made
difficult given that cardiovascular outcome studies of arbs
have been conducted in very different patient populations,
ranging from low risk patients with hypertension (eg, the
losartan intervention for endpoint reduction in hypertension [life]69 and  xxxd3487xxx  antihypertensive long-term
use evaluation [value]70 trials) through to patients with
severe underlying cardiovascular disease (eg, the  xxxd3487xxx 
heart failure trial [valheft], 71 candesartan in heart
failure assessment of reduction in mortality and morbidity
[charm] trial, 72 and  xxxd3487xxx  in acute myocardial
infarction trial [valiant]).73
current evidence focusing on  xxxd3303xxx  suggest that
pleiotropic effects manifest as improvements in endothelial

dysfunction, reductions in lvh, renoprotection in normotensive
and hypertensive subjects, improvements in metabolic param­
eters, and potential benefits in cerebrovascular disease,
as discussed below.

 xxxd3303xxx  and endothelial function
one mechanism by which  xxxd3303xxx  may prevent tod is
by reducing or reversing endothelial dysfunction, which is
one of the first signs of vascular damage and is partly driven
by oxidative stress. 74  xxxd3303xxx  reduced superoxide
production,  xxxd3210xxx 
(nadph) oxidase activity, and markers of oxidative stress
in  xxxg177xxx -deficient mice.75 in addition,  xxxd3303xxx 
decreased the size of atherosclerotic lesions.75 in spontaneously hypertensive rats,  xxxd3303xxx  expression of nadph
oxidase is reduced and there was increased expression of
endothelial  xxxd2738xxx  synthase, which is likely to contribute
to reduced oxidative stress.76
oxidative stress also promotes the accumulation of
advanced glycation end (age) products.77 together with their
cell-surface receptor (rage), ages are a major cause of the
microvascular damage that accompanies the hyperglycemia
of diabetes. in cultured endothelial cells,  xxxd3303xxx  prevents
 xxxg99xxx -induced upregulation of rage expression.78
corroboration for this effect is provided by studies in

vascular health and risk management 2010:6

 xxxd3303xxx -treated spontaneously hypertensive rats in which
the rage expression that would normally accompany intraocular age expression did not occur.79
platelet-derived growth factor (pdgf) is a mitogen that
is upregulated by oxidative stress and inflammatory stimuli.80
it is known to be produced by smooth muscle cells and is
one of the most potent growth factors that is involved in
the progression of macroangiopathy as seen in diabetes.
 xxxd3303xxx  has been shown to reduce  xxxg99xxx -induced
oxidative stress and thereby suppressed the expression of
pdgf-b in cultured bovine retinal pericytes.81,82
clinical evidence for improvements in endothelial function with  xxxd3303xxx  is provided by the  xxxd3303xxx  versus
ramipril in renal endothelial dysfunction (trendy®)
study.83 both  xxxd3303xxx  40 mg and ramipril 5 mg improved
endothelial function, assessed by measuring renal plasma
flow in response to the infusion of  xxxd3291xxx 
acetate ( xxxd3291xxx ), in patients with mild-to-moderate hypertension and normo- or microalbuminuria. another measure
of endothelial function, brachial artery flow-mediated
dilation, was improved by 36% by ramipril 2.5 mg, 96% by
 xxxd3303xxx  40 mg, and by 111% with the combination in
nonhypertensive patients with well-controlled type 2 diabetes
mellitus, but without coronary artery disease, left ventricular
dysfunction, or microalbuminuria.84

 xxxd3303xxx  and arterial stiffness
arterial stiffness is an important risk factor for cardiovascular
mortality85 and is increased on acute infusion of  xxxg99xxx .86
prior administration of  xxxd3303xxx  significantly attenuated
this acute response, as indicated by changes in systemic
vascular resistance and the pulse wave stiffness index.87
furthermore, in patients with type 2 diabetes and mildto-moderate hypertension,  xxxd3303xxx  40 mg for 3 weeks
reduced arterial stiffness measured by pulse wave velocity
along the carotid–femoral route.88 another study in patients
with hypertension suggests that the improvement in pulse
wave velocity is greater than predicted on the basis of blood
pressure changes.89

metabolic effects of  xxxd3303xxx 
vascular risk factors of hypertension, hyperglycemia, and
atherogenic dyslipidemia are prevalent abnormalities in
subjects with type 2 diabetes. diabetes increases cardiovascular risk to the same extent as a prior myocardial infarction
(mi) in a nondiabetic subject.90
studies in hypertensive patients have shown consistently
that  xxxd3303xxx  improves insulin sensitivity and lipid profiles.
for example, in patients with type 2 diabetes (managed with
diet and exercise) and mild hypertension,  xxxd3303xxx  40 mg
was significantly more effective than eprosartan 600 mg in
reducing low-density lipoprotein (ldl)-cholesterol, total
cholesterol, and triglycerides.39 in another study conducted in
patients with type 2 diabetes treated with oral hypoglycemics,
 xxxd3303xxx  40 mg produced significantly greater reductions
than nifedipine gits 20 mg in ldl-cholesterol and total
cholesterol.55 the effects of  xxxd3303xxx  on lipid parameters
have been also been observed in smaller study91 and in a
post-marketing surveillance study in which people with and
without diabetes were treated with  xxxd3303xxx  40 to 80 mg
for at least 1 year.92 in the latter study, triglycerides were
reduced by 17.4 mg/dl and cholesterol by 16.4 mg/dl in the
population as a whole and were 22.7 mg/dl and 23.8 mg/dl,
respectively, in patients with hypercholesterolemia. among
patients with diabetes, the reductions were 22.7 mg/dl and
17.4 mg/dl, respectively.
 xxxd3303xxx  has been demonstrated to improve markers
of glycemic control, such as glycosylated hemoglobin93,94 and
insulin91 in patients with type 2 diabetes. reductions in insulin
resistance with  xxxd3303xxx  have also been demonstrated in
nondiabetic subjects.95,96 moreover,  xxxd3303xxx  80 mg
lowered insulin resistance, as measured by the homeostasis
model assessment method, to a significantly greater extent
than losartan 50 mg in hypertensive patients with metabolic

syndrome.97 free plasma glucose, glycosylated hemoglobin
and response to the oral glucose tolerance test were also
significantly improved by  xxxd3303xxx .

 xxxd3303xxx  in renal impairment
the progression of renal disease can be halted by ras
blockade mediated through reductions in glomerular pressure
and through decreased inflammation and oxidative stress.
evidence for the renoprotective effect of  xxxd3303xxx  comes
from studies that together have demonstrated positive benefits
on renal function in the renal continuum from endothelial
dysfunction through to reductions in macroalbuminuria.
in the trendy® study,  xxxd3303xxx  not only improved
renal endothelial function in patients with type 2 diabetes but
also preserved renal function.83 in comparison with ramipril,
 xxxd3303xxx  significantly improved resting renal plasma
flow, renal vascular resistance, and lowered albuminuria.
the diabetics exposed to  xxxd3303xxx  and enalapril
(detail®) study showed the long-term benefit of  xxxd3303xxx 
in patients with type 2 diabetes and either micro- or macroalbuminuria.98 glomerular filtration rate (gfr) declined in
the first year with both treatments, but this effect has also
been observed with ace inhibitors and other arbs, and has
been attributed to a hemodynamic effect.99,100 thereafter, the
rate of decline was markedly reduced, such that by year 3,
the annual decline in gfr had stabilized to approximately
2 ml/min/1.73 m2, which is substantially lower than the
10 to 12 ml/min/1.73 m2 that is typical in untreated diabetics
with macroalbuminuria.101
 xxxd3303xxx  has also been shown to reduce albuminuria
compared with  xxxd2294xxx  in nondiabetic patients with isolated
systolic hypertension102 and to reduce microalbuminuria
by 69% over the course of a 12-month, noncomparative
study in hypertensive patients.103 other studies confirmed
that  xxxd3303xxx  reduced macroalbuminuria in patients with
mild and moderate renal failure.104,105 the effects of  xxxd3303xxx  on proteinuria may well be additive to those of ace
inhibitors.106
several large-scale clinical studies have been completed
that demonstrate the beneficial effects of  xxxd3303xxx  on renal
function. the incipient to overt:  xxxg99xxx  blocker,
 xxxd3303xxx , investigation on type 2 diabetic nephropathy
(innovation®) study was performed in normotensive, as
well as in hypertensive, japanese patients.107 over a mean
of 1.3 years’ treatment, both  xxxd3303xxx  40 and 80 mg
significantly reduced transition rates to overt nephropathy in
comparison with placebo. reduced transition rates to overt
nephropathy remained after adjustment for changes in sbp

and in normotensive patients, suggesting  xxxd3303xxx  had a
blood pressure-independent effect.
the sister studies, a trial to compare  xxxd3303xxx  40 mg
titrated to 80 mg versus losartan 50 mg titrated to 100 mg in
hypertensive type 2 diabetic patients with overt nephropathy (amadeo ™ ), and investigate the efficacy of
 xxxd3303xxx ® versus  xxxd3487xxx  in hypertensive type 2 diabetic
patients with overt nephropathy (vivaldi®) evaluated the
effect of  xxxd3303xxx  on macroalbuminuria. in amadeo™,
 xxxd3303xxx  reduced urinary protein:creatinine significantly
more than losartan after 52 weeks (29% versus 20% from
baseline, respectively; p = 0.03), despite similar blood
pressure control.108 this suggests that there are intra-class
difference in the renal effects of arbs, which is consistent
with additional properties beyond the blood pressurelowering effect. in vivaldi®,  xxxd3303xxx  80 mg provided
identical reductions in urinary protein excretion (33% from
baseline) to  xxxd3487xxx  160 mg and there were no significant
differences between the two agents in serum creatinine,
creatinine clearance, or estimated gfr changes.109 these
studies suggest that  xxxd3303xxx  may slow the progression
of diabetic nephropathy in this group of patients.

cardiac disease
the presence of lvh in patients with established hypertension nearly triples the incidence of coronary heart disease
and stroke, and increases the incidence of heart failure
about seven-fold.110 reducing lvm significantly reduces
cardiovascular risk.111  xxxg99xxx  plays a central role
in cardiac hypertrophy, causing a trophic response to
increased blood pressure and having direct proliferative
effects.112 the clinical evidence that  xxxd3303xxx  reduces
lvm comes from several studies. for example,  xxxd3303xxx 
reduced lvm from 151.6 to 135.1 g/m2, largely due to
decreased thickness of the left ventricular wall, in hypertensive patients.113  xxxd3303xxx  has been compared with
other antihypertensives, including diuretics, beta-blockers,
ace inhibitors, and other arbs.  xxxd3303xxx  80 mg
proved superior to  xxxd2294xxx  25 mg, with the reduction in
lvm being significantly greater with  xxxd3303xxx  for a
given percentage change in blood pressure.57  xxxd3303xxx 
80 mg was more effective in reducing lvm than carvedilol
25 mg, despite there being no significant difference in
24-hour mean sbp/dbp reductions between the two treatments.53 addition of  xxxd3303xxx  80 mg to ramipril 5 mg
provided further beneficial effects on lvm, although
there were similar reductions in blood pressure with either
monotherapy or combination.114

vascular health and risk management 2010:6

 xxxd3303xxx  in hypertension and cardiovascular risk management

a 12-week study showed that replacing twice-daily
enalapril 10 mg with once-daily  xxxd3303xxx  10 to 80 mg does
not produce any acute deterioration of exercise capacity or
clinical status in patients with mild-to-moderate congestive
heart failure (chf) (new york heart association [nyha]
class ii or iii and left ventricular ejection fraction 40%).115
the study also found no differences in changes of other
parameters, such as ejection fraction, nyha classification,
and mean sbp between the treatment groups.

atrial fibrillation
arbs and ace inhibitors have been shown to be effective
in preventing atrial fibrillation in patients with heart failure
or left ventricular dysfunction, as seen in the meta-analysis
by healey and colleagues.116 the ras plays an important
role facilitating new onset or recurrence of atrial fibrillation.
it mediates atrial remodeling by increasing blood pressure,
intracavitary atrial pressure, and arrhythmogenic atrial
remodeling, by facilitating coronary atherosclerosis and
by increasing reactive oxygen substances and favoring
atrial fibrosis. blocking the ras may prevent left atrial
dilatation, atrial fibrosis, dysfunction, and conduction
velocity slowing.
there are different clinical scenarios involving prevention
of atrial fibrillation in the hypertensive patient (ie, those who
have not had any previous episodes of atrial fibrillation, and
those with parossistic or persistent atrial fibrillation who
either do not need any anti-arrhythmic therapy, or those with
persistent atrial fibrillation who do require anti-arrhythmic
therapy to maintain sinus rhythm following cardioversion).
previous studies suggest that inhibition of ras with arbs
or ace inhibitors may prevent new onset atrial fibrillation in
patients without any previous episodes of atrial fibrillation,117
and recurrence after cardioversion in hypertensive patients
requiring antiarrhythmic therapy.118 previously, we investigated whether  xxxd3303xxx  prevented the recurrence of atrial
fibrillation in hypertensive patients who did not require antiarrhythmic therapy. we compared the efficacy of  xxxd3303xxx 
and carvedilol in preventing the recurrence of atrial fibrillation in 154 hypertensive patients with a recent history of
atrial fibrillation.119 there was an atrial fibrillation episode
in 14.2% (10/70) of patients who received  xxxd3303xxx 
compared with 37% (23/62) of those receiving carvedilol
(p  0.005). in addition to preventing recurrence of atrial
fibrillation, the time to a recurrence of atrial fibrillation was
longer with  xxxd3303xxx  than with carvedilol. this difference
in the rates of new episodes of atrial fibrillation between the
agents was not related to changes in blood pressure, left atrial

size, although a greater left ventricular mass reduction in the
 xxxd3303xxx  group was observed. this suggests preventive
properties of  xxxd3303xxx  were a pharmacologic effect. it is
possible that  xxxd3303xxx  favorably interferes with electrical
and structural atrial remodeling in hypertensive patients.

cerebrovascular disease
for each 2 mmhg increase in sbp, the risk of stroke is
increased by 10%.45  xxxg99xxx  pathways appear not only
to be implicated in blood pressure control and body fluid
homeostasis, but may also contribute to the pathogenesis
of stroke via the stimulation of at1 receptors.120 the use
of arbs may not only prevent the ischemic effect of
 xxxg99xxx  mediated via at1 receptors, but also stimulate
the unoccupied  xxxg101xxx  receptors with a consequent improvement of brain ischemia. intra-cerebroventricular infusion
of an arb for 5 days has been shown to induce neuronal
regrowth after cerebral ischemia and to reduce expression of
transcription factors c-fos and c-jun that are associated with
programmed cell death and neurodegeneration.121 to date,
evidence of possible beneficial effects of  xxxd3303xxx  on
cerebrovascular disease are provided by studies in animals.
in rats,  xxxd3303xxx  is able to cross the blood–brain
barrier and block the effects of centrally administered
 xxxg99xxx .122 furthermore, at doses that had no effect
on blood pressure,  xxxd3303xxx  delayed the onset of stroke
in spontaneously hypertensive, stroke-prone animals.123
in cerebral arterioles,  xxxd3303xxx  reversed the vasoconstrictor
effect of  xxxg99xxx , changing the response to a vasodilatory one124 and overcame the cerebral arterial remodeling
occurring in spontaneously hypertensive rats.125
although the effect of  xxxd3303xxx  on stroke has yet to be
demonstrated in clinical studies, the effects of  xxxd3303xxx  on
cognitive function have been examined in elderly subjects
with hypertension.126 in addition to providing superior blood
pressure control compared with lisinopril 20 mg plus  xxxd2294xxx ,
 xxxd3303xxx  80 mg given with  xxxd2294xxx  12.5 mg improved
performance on cognitive tests significantly more than
lisinopril/ xxxd2294xxx .

 xxxd3303xxx  outcome trials
the ontarget® program consists of two long-term, largescale, double-blind, multinational outcome studies – the
ontarget® study50 and the parallel  xxxd3303xxx  randomized assessment study in ace intolerant subjects with
cardiovascular disease (transcend®) study.127
the ontarget® study compared  xxxd3303xxx  80 mg
monotherapy to ramipril 10 mg monotherapy and the

combination to ramipril alone. the primary endpoint was a
composite of cardiovascular mortality, nonfatal mi, nonfatal
stroke, and hospitalization for chf. secondary endpoints
included newly diagnosed chf, cardiovascular revascularization, newly diagnosed diabetes, cognitive decline/
dementia, new onset of atrial fibrillation, and nephropathy.
ontarget® was conducted in patients who could tolerate
ace inhibitor therapy, whereas transcend® compared
 xxxd3303xxx  with placebo in addition to best standard of care
in patients intolerant of this class using the same endpoints
as ontarget®.
in the ontarget ® study, the primary outcome
occurred in 1423 patients (16.7%) in the  xxxd3303xxx  group,
1412 patients (16.5%) in the ramipril group, and in 1386
(16.3%) in the combination-therapy group.50  xxxd3303xxx 
was non-inferior to ramipril, and the combination offered
no additional protective effect. the results for the secondary
outcome of death from cardiovascular causes, myocardial
infarction or stroke were consistent with those of the primary
outcome.
even though individuals who were intolerant to ace
inhibitors had been excluded from the trial, 360 patients in
the ramipril group stopped their medication because of cough
compared with only 93 patients in the  xxxd3303xxx  group.
angioedema resulted in 25 patients discontinuing ramipril
compared with 10 patients in the  xxxd3303xxx  group. rates of
cough and angioedema were also higher in the combination
group than in the  xxxd3303xxx  group. in the combination
group, significantly more patients stopped because of
hypotensive symptoms, diarrhea, or renal impairment than
in the ramipril group. the incidence of these events was also
numerically higher than in the  xxxd3303xxx  group, although
no statistics were reported for this comparison.
on the basis of the ontarget® results,  xxxd3303xxx 
is the only arb proven to have cardiovascular protective
effects in a broad cross section of high-risk patients. it is as
effective as ramipril but is associated with less angioedema
and cough. the combination offers no additional efficacy
advantage compared with the monotherapies. as the authors
of the ontarget® publication state, the choice between
 xxxd3303xxx  and ramipril ‘will depend on the preferences of
the patients and physicians and the individual’s susceptibility
to specific adverse events’.
in the transcend ® study,  xxxd3303xxx  was well
tolerated among patients who were unable to tolerate ace
inhibitors. although the reduction in the primary outcome
(which included hospitalizations for heart failure) with
 xxxd3303xxx  did not achieve statistical significance, it did

significantly reduce the risk of the composite outcome
of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, or stroke
by 13%.127 moreover, adherence to  xxxd3303xxx  was high
and better in the comparison arm, in which patients received
the best standard of care. it is reasonable to assume that the
greater tolerability and treatment adherence observed with
 xxxd3303xxx  in both ontarget® and transcend® will
be of benefit for many patients who are likely to require
life-long treatment.
the potential cerebroprotective efficacy of  xxxd3303xxx 
was evaluated in the prevention regimen for effectively
avoiding second strokes (profess®) study.128 the 4-year
study compared  xxxd3303xxx  and placebo on top of usual
care, including antihypertensives to control blood pressure,
in 20,000 patients with known prior ischemic stroke.
the study had a 2 × 2 factorial design, with patients also
receiving either aspirin plus  xxxd1914xxx  extended release
or clopidogrel alone. the primary outcome was time to
recurrent stroke, while secondary outcomes included the onset
of vascular events including bleeding events or chf. there
was non significant trend favoring  xxxd3303xxx  over usual care
for the primary endpoint.129 exploratory analyses indicate that
after excluding the first 6 months of treatment, the incidence
of recurrent stroke or major vascular events was significantly
lower with  xxxd3303xxx . the mean treatment period was
2.5 years and a longer treatment period may have allowed
the trends that were observed to become significant.

conclusions
the pharmacologic features of  xxxd3303xxx  enable it to
provide greater and more sustained antihypertensive efficacy
than many other antihypertensive agents, and compared
with other antihypertensive in other classes,  xxxd3303xxx  is
well tolerated.  xxxd3303xxx  in combination with  xxxd2294xxx  or
amlodipine provides greater reductions in blood pressure
than the respective monotherapies, and these combinations
are well tolerated. the antihypertensive efficacy of  xxxd3303xxx  monotherapy and combinations should translate into
increased protection against cardiovascular events. there
is also growing evidence that  xxxd3303xxx  and arbs have
beneficial effects on various stages of the cardiovascular
and renal continua that may not be solely explained by
the lowering of blood pressure. ontarget® has shown
that  xxxd3303xxx  provides similar cardiovascular protection
to ramipril in high-risk patients, while being better tolerated and associated with greater treatment adherence; the
latter property is likely to be important in the long-term
management of cardiovascular risk.

vascular health and risk management 2010:6

 xxxd3303xxx  in hypertension and cardiovascular risk management

the attributes of  xxxd3303xxx  and the clinical evidence
of its efficacy suggest that it should be one of the preferred
options for the treatment of hypertension in mild to moderate
hypertensive patients and make it an attractive foundation for
use in combination therapy. the findings of both ontarget® and transcend® demonstrate that  xxxd3303xxx  provides a protective benefit when added to other therapies. its
effect on cardiovascular endpoints combined with its proven
tolerability suggest that  xxxd3303xxx  could be considered as
a potential treatment for patients with vascular disease or
high-risk diabetes, irrespective of whether or not they can
tolerate ace inhibitors.
