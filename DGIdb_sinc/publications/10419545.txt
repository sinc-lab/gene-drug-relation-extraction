molecular characterization of binding of substrates and inhibitors to dt- xxxg641xxx : combined approach involving site-directed mutagenesis, inhibit...  the molecular basis of the interaction of dt- xxxg641xxx  with a cytotoxic nitrobenzamide  xxxd3416xxx  [5-(aziridin-1-yl)-2, 4-dinitrobenzamide] and five inhibitors was investigated with wild-type dt- xxxg641xxx  (human and rat) and five mutants [three rat mutants (ry128d, rg150v, rh194d) and two human mutants (hy155f, hh161q)]. hy155f and hh161q were generated to evaluate a hypothesis that tyr155 and his161 participate in the obligatory two-electron transfer reaction of the enzyme. the catalytic properties of hy155f and hh161q were compared with a naturally occurring mutant, hp187s. pro187 to ser mutation disturbs the structure of the central parallel beta-sheet, resulting in a reduction of the binding affinity of the  xxxd2112xxx  prosthetic group. with nadh as the electron donor and  xxxd2563xxx  as the electron acceptor, the k(cat) values for the wild-type human dt- xxxg641xxx , hy155f, hh161q, and hp187s were measured as 66 +/- 1, 23 +/- 0, 5 +/- 0 and 8 +/- 2 x 10(3) min(-1), respectively. because hy155f still has significant catalytic activity, the hydroxyl group on tyr155 may not be as important as proposed. interestingly, hy155f was found to be 3. 3 times more active than the human wild-type dt- xxxg641xxx  in the reduction of  xxxd3416xxx . computer modeling based on our results suggests that  xxxd3416xxx  is situated in the active site, with the aziridinyl group pointing toward tyr155 and the amide group placed near a hydrophobic pocket next to tyr128.  xxxd1875xxx ,  xxxd1689xxx , chrysin, 7,8-dihydroxyflavone, and phenindone are competitive inhibitors of the enzyme with respect to nicotinamide coenzymes. the binding orientations of  xxxd1875xxx , flavones, and phenindone in the active site of dt- xxxg641xxx  were predicted by results from our inhibitor-binding studies and computer modeling based on published x-ray structures. our studies generated results that explain why  xxxd1875xxx  is a potent inhibitor and binds differently from flavones and phenindone in the active site of dt- xxxg641xxx .
