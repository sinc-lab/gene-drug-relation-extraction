molecular mechanisms of  xxxg1601xxx  signaling.  this review highlights the most recent findings on the molecular mechanisms of the  xxxg1601xxx  (gr). most effects of glucocorticoids are mediated by the intracellular gr which is present in almost every tissue and controls transcriptional activation via direct and indirect mechanisms. nevertheless the glu-cocorticoid responses are tissue -and gene- specific. gr associates selectively with corticosteroid ligands produced in the adrenal gland in response to changes of humoral homeostasis. ligand interaction with gr promotes either gr binding to genomic glucocorticoid response elements, in turn modulating gene transcription, or interaction of gr monomers with other transcription factors activated by other signalling pathways leading to transrepression. the gr regulates a broad spectrum of physiological functions, including cell differentiation, metabolism and inflammatory responses. thus, disruption or dysregulation of gr function will result in severe impairments in the maintenance of homeostasis and the control of adaptation to stress.
