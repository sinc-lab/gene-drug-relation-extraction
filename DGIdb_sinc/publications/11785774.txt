involvement of constitutive ( xxxg1883xxx ) and inducible cyclooxygenase ( xxxg1884xxx ) in the adrenergic-induced acth and corticosterone secretion.  the involvement of prostaglandins synthesized by constitutive ( xxxg1883xxx ) and inducible cyclooxygenase ( xxxg1884xxx ) in central stimulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (hpa) axis by adrenergic receptor agonists was investigated in conscious rats.  xxxg1883xxx  and  xxxg1884xxx  inhibitor,  xxxd2969xxx  (0.02 and 0.2 microg) and compound ns-398 (0.01 and 0.1 microg), respectively, were given intracerebroventricularly (i.c.v.) 15 min prior to i.c.v. adrenergic receptor agonists: phenylephrine (30 microg) and clonidine (10 microg), an  xxxg87xxx   xxxg830xxx - and  xxxg831xxx -adrenergic agonist, and  xxxd2398xxx  (20 microg) a non-selective beta-adrenergic agonist and clenbuterol (10 microg) a selective  xxxg837xxx   xxxg1553xxx   xxxg2356xxx -adrenergic agonist.  xxxd2969xxx  and ns-398 considerably and dose-dependently reduced the phenylephrine-induced increase in acth and corticosterone secretion. pretreatment with  xxxd2969xxx  and ns-398 markedly impaired the clonidine-evoked acth and corticosterone secretion.  xxxd2969xxx  moderately diminished the  xxxd2398xxx -elicited increase in acth and corticosterone, while ns-398 did not markedly alter acth secretion. the clenbuterol-induced acth and corticosterone responses were considerably impaired by pretreatment with  xxxd2969xxx , and slightly less potently by ns-398. these results indicate that in central structures involved in regulation of the hpa axis both constitutive and inducible cyclooxygenase are present under normal conditions in rats. these isoenzymes are significantly involved in the stimulatory signaling transduced by postsynaptic  xxxg87xxx   xxxg830xxx -adrenergic receptors and, to a lesser extent, by  xxxg831xxx -adrenergic receptors. both isoenzymes affect moderately the stimulatory action of a non-selective beta-adrenergic agonist on acth and corticosterone secretion.  xxxg1883xxx  participates considerably and  xxxg1884xxx  markedly in the potent stimulatory action of selective  xxxg837xxx   xxxg1553xxx   xxxg2356xxx -adrenergic receptors on hpa axis.
