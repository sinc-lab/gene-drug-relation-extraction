thiazide and high ceiling diuretics were recently shown to inhibit all mammalian isoforms of carbonic
anhydrase (ca,  xxxg287xxx   xxxg290xxx   xxxg293xxx   xxxg295xxx   xxxg301xxx ) with a very different proﬁle as compared to classical inhibitors, such as acetazolamide,  xxxd2592xxx , and  xxxd2058xxx . some of these structurally related compounds have a
very different behavior against the widespread isozyme ca ii, with  xxxd1680xxx ,  xxxd3425xxx ,
and furosemide being efﬁcient inhibitors against ca ii (kis of 65–138 nm), whereas  xxxd2343xxx  is a much
weaker one (ki of 2520 nm). furthermore, some of these diuretics are quite efﬁcient (low nanomolar)
inhibitors of other isoforms, for example,  xxxd1680xxx  against hca vb, vii, ix, and xiii;  xxxd2343xxx 
against ca vii, ix, xii, and xiii,  xxxd3425xxx  against ca vii and ix, and furosemide against ca i
and xiv. examining the four x-ray crystal structures of their ca ii adducts, we observed several (2–3)
active site water molecules interacting with the  xxxd1680xxx ,  xxxd3425xxx , and furosemide
scaffolds which may be responsible for this important difference of activity. indeed,  xxxd2343xxx  bound
to ca ii has no interactions with active site water molecules.  xxxd1680xxx  bound within the ca ii active
site is in an enolic (lactimic) tautomeric form, with the enolic oh also participating in two strong hydrogen bonds with asn67 and a water molecule. the newly evidenced binding modes of these diuretics may
be exploited for designing better ca ii inhibitors as well as compounds with selectivity/afﬁnity for various isoforms with medicinal chemistry applications.

1. introduction
thiazide and high ceiling diuretics represent a class of pharmacological agents with a ﬁrm place in clinical medicine, and many
representatives which share several common structural features
such as the presence of free so2nh2 moieties attached to a chlorobenzene scaffold, with the halogen atom in ortho to the sulfamoyl
group, as well as various other usually bulky groups substituting
the aromatic scaffold.1 drugs such as hydrochlorothiazide,  xxxd1680xxx ,  xxxd2343xxx ,  xxxd3425xxx , or furosemide among
others were the ﬁrst well-tolerated and efﬁcient antihypertensive
drugs that signiﬁcantly reduced cardiovascular disease (cvd) morbidity and mortality in placebo-controlled clinical studies.2–6 most
of them are widely used in patients with cvd but are also used for
those suffering from type ii diabetes, obesity, and related metabolic complications, and are highly prescribed.1–6 the mechanism
of action of thiazide drugs is more complicated as initially thought,
as apart from the diuretic/saluretic one,1–6 it has recently been
shown that many such sulfonamides exert a direct vasodilator

effect by activating calcium-activated potassium channels (kca),4c
which in turn are dependent on the ph control of the zinc enzyme
carbonic anhydrase (ca,  xxxg287xxx   xxxg290xxx   xxxg293xxx   xxxg295xxx   xxxg301xxx ) which catalyzes the interconversion between carbon dioxide and bicarbonate, with a release
of a proton.1,7 furthermore, among all such sulfonamide diuretics,
 xxxd1680xxx  seems to be the most effective agent,2 together with
 xxxd2343xxx .2a recently, we8,9 reinvestigated the ca inhibitory
properties of this class of sulfonamides which have been launched
in a period when only isoforms ca i and ii were known, among
the 16 mammalian cas presently characterized in vertebrates.7 indeed, this family of enzymes comprises several cytosolic isoforms
(ca i–iii, ca vii, and ca xiii), ﬁve membrane-bound isozymes (ca
iv, ca ix, ca xii, ca xiv, and ca xv), two mitochondrial forms
(ca va and vb), as well as one secreted ca isozyme, ca vi. three
acatalytic isozymes are also known, that is, ca viii, ca x, and ca
xi.7,10–12 these enzymes are involved in crucial physiological processes connected with respiration and transport of co2/bicarbonate
between metabolizing tissues and lungs, ph and co2 homeostasis,
electrolyte secretion in a variety of tissues/organs, biosynthetic
reactions (such as gluconeogenesis, lipogenesis, and ureagenesis),
bone resorption, calciﬁcation, tumorigenicity, and several other
physiologic/pathologic processes.7–13

sulfonamide ca inhibitors (cais), such as acetazolamide 1,
 xxxd2592xxx  2, or  xxxd2058xxx  3 among others, are clinically
used agents for the management of a variety of disorders connected to ca disbalances, such as glaucoma; in the treatment of
edema due to congestive heart failure, or for drug-induced edema;
such as mountain sickness drugs,7–13 whereas other agents of this
pharmacological class show applications as anticonvulsants,14
antiobesity15, or antitumor drugs/tumor diagnostic agents.7,11,16
sulfonamides such as  xxxd1680xxx  4,  xxxd2343xxx  5,  xxxd3425xxx  6, and furosemide 7 are widely used as diuretics,1,8,9 as
mentioned above, whereas many classes of new cais are constantly being reported due to at least two reasons: (i) a large number of catalytically active isoforms are known (12 in primates, 13 in
other mammals)7, which are drug targets for many types of applications, as mentioned above.7–16 indeed, for example, the antiglaucoma sulfonamide drugs target ca ii and iv, the antiobesity cais
target ca va and ca vb, the anticonvulsant ones probably target
ca vii and xiv, whereas the antitumor drugs/diagnostic agents target the transmembrane isoforms overexpressed in tumors, ca ix
and xii;7–16 and (ii) the lack of isozyme selectivity of the presently
available, clinically used compounds.7
in recent reports, we have reinvestigated the inhibition activity of
sulfonamide diuretics against all catalytically active mammalian
cas, that is, isoforms ca i–ca xiv, of human (h) or murine (m) origin.8,9 several interesting facts emerged from this study, among
which the potent inhibition observed with some of these drugs
against isozymes involved in important pathologies, such as cancer
and obesity. for example, low nanomolar (or even subnanomolar)
inhibitors were detected, for example,  xxxd1680xxx  4 against ca
vb, vii, ix, xii, and xiii,  xxxd2343xxx  5 against ca vii, ix, xii, and xiii,
furosemide 7 against ca i, ii, and xiv.8,9 we have also resolved the xray crystal structure of  xxxd2343xxx  5, a modest ca ii inhibitor, in
complex with this ubiquitous, house-keeping isoform.8 an unexplained issue of the preceding study8 was, however, the important
differences in the inhibition proﬁles of these cas with the structurally related drugs such as  xxxd1680xxx  4,  xxxd2343xxx  5,  xxxd3425xxx  6, and furosemide 7, with compounds 4, 6, and 7
being generally much better ca ii inhibitors (kis of 65–138 nm), compared to  xxxd2343xxx  5 (ki of 2520 nm). here, we discuss the x-ray
crystal structures for the adducts of  xxxd1680xxx  4,  xxxd2343xxx 

7

5,  xxxd3425xxx  6, and furosemide 7 with hca ii, and by comparing them we unravel new binding modes of these diuretics. primarily, we evidence the interaction between several (between 2
and 3) water molecules present within the enzyme active site for
the hca ii– xxxd1680xxx / xxxd3425xxx /furosemide adducts,
which lack in the corresponding hca ii– xxxd2343xxx  complex, and
which may be used for designing better ca ii inhibitors as well as
compounds with potential selectivity for various isoforms with
medicinal chemistry applications, among the 12 such targets presently known.
2. results and discussion
2.1. chemistry and ca inhibition
 xxxd1680xxx  4,  xxxd2343xxx  5,  xxxd3425xxx  6, and furosemide 7 possess several common structural features. thus, all these
compounds incorporate a 2-chloro-benzenesulfonamide ‘warhead’,
which is present in many cais,7 since the deprotonated sulfonamide
moiety constitutes the zinc binding group, which is coordinated to
the catalytic zn(ii) ion present at the bottom of the enzyme active
site.6–13 in meta to the sulfamoyl moiety, these drugs (except 6) possess a bulky moiety, constituted by a benzoannulated ﬁve-membered ring incorporating a nitrogen heterocycle for 4 and 5, or a
cooh moiety for furosemide 7.  xxxd3425xxx  is obviously
slightly different, as the 2-chloro-benzenesulfonamide ring is annulated to the thiadiazine-s,s-dioxide ring, incorporating the chcl2
substituent. although there are so many structural similarities
among compounds 4–7, their ca inhibition proﬁles are very different (see later in the text).
inhibition data of the clinically used sulfonamide cais such as
acetazolamide 1,  xxxd2592xxx  2,  xxxd2058xxx  3,  xxxd1680xxx  4,  xxxd2343xxx  5,  xxxd3425xxx  6, and furosemide 7
against isoforms ca i–xiv are shown in table 1.
it may be observed that the classical sulfonamide cais 1–3 are
promiscuous inhibitors of all isozymes except ca iii that is known
to possess a low afﬁnity for this class of inhibitors.18 in fact, all isozymes are generally inhibited by these compounds with inhibition
constants <100 nm (except ca i inhibition with acetazolamide 1
and ca iv inhibition with  xxxd2592xxx  2), but with many low

nanomolar or even subnanomolar inhibition patterns being present in the data of table 1. it is thus obvious that the simple, classical cais 1–3 are not good leads for designing isozyme-selective
cais. however, data of table 1 also show that compounds 4–6, possessing more complicated scaffolds as compared to 1–3, show a
much more interesting inhibition proﬁle, with some isoforms
being very well inhibited and others being weakly inhibited by
these sulfonamides. for example,  xxxd1680xxx  4 is a medium potency inhibitor of ca i, ii, and iv (kis in the range of 138–348 nm), a
very effective inhibitor of ca vb, ca vii, ca ix, ca xii, and ca xiii
(kis in the range of 2.8–23 nm), and an ineffective inhibitor of ca
iii, va, vi, and xiv (kis in the range of 917–1.1  104 nm). structurally related to 4,  xxxd2343xxx  5 is a quite ineffective inhibitor of ca
i, ii, iii, va, vi, and xiv (kis in the range of 890–2.3  105 nm), a
medium potency inhibitor of ca iv and ca vb (kis in the range
of 213–274 nm), and a very effective inhibitor of ca vii, ix, xii,
and xiii (kis in the range of 0.23–36 nm). inhibition data for  xxxd3425xxx  6 against various ca isoforms are not available
in the literature and they are reported here for the ﬁrst time (the
hydrochlorothiazide (with a h instead of the chcl2 moiety present
in 6) inhibition data were recently released, see ref. 7). it may be
observed that 6 is an efﬁcient inhibitor of ca ii and ix (ki of 87–
91 nm) a very potent ca vii inhibitor (ki of 7.9 nm).  xxxd3425xxx  is then a medium potency inhibitor of isoforms hca i,
iv, vb, and xii (kis in the range of 134–449 nm), being a much less
effective inhibitor for hca iii, va, vi, mca xiii, and hca xiv (kis in
the range of 645–5.6  105 nm, table 1). furosemide 7 is a potent
inhibitor of hca i, ii, and xiv (kis in the range of 52–65 nm), moderately inhibiting all other isoforms except hca iii (kis in the range
of245–564 nm against hca iv–mca xiii). as all other sulfonamides
known to date, furosemide is a weak hca iii inhibitor (ki of 3.2 lm,
table 1).

three-dimensional structure of the complex revealed a compact
binding between the inhibitor and the enzyme active site, similar
to that observed earlier for other such complexes, with the tetrahedral geometry of the zn2+ binding site and the key hydrogen bonds
between the so2nh2 moiety of the inhibitors and enzyme active
site all retained (figs. 2 and 3, and table 2).8,9,13,17 in particular,
the ionized nitrogen atoms of the sulfonamides group of 4–7 are
coordinated to the zinc ion at a distance of 2.00–2.15 å, (table
2). this nitrogen is also hydrogen bonded to the hydroxyl group
of thr199 (n  thr199og = 2.77–2.95 å), which in turn interacts
with the glu106oe1 atom (2.50 å, data not shown). one oxygen
atom of the sulfonamide moiety is 2.89–3.06 å away from the catalytic zn2+ ion, which is considered as ‘semi’-coordinated to the
metal ion, whereas the second one participates in a hydrogen bond

the overall hca ii-4 complex is shown in figure 1, whereas
figures 2 and 3 as well as table 2 show the detailed interactions

participate when bound within the hca ii active site. active site residues coordinating the metal ion (his94, 96, 119) as well as those involved in the binding of inhibitors are
also shown. ordered water molecules critical for the binding of some of these inhibitors to the ca ii active site are evidenced as red spheres.

(of 2.92–3.19 å) with the backbone amide group of thr199.8,13,17
on the other hand, very interesting interactions have been evidenced between the oh moiety and nh–c@o fragments present
in the ﬁve-membered cycle of  xxxd1680xxx  4 and the hca ii active site amino acid residues/water molecules. thus, the hydroxyl
moiety participates in two hydrogen bonds, with the oh group
of thr200 (of 2.54 å), and with a water molecule, w161, of
3.16 å (figs. 2 and 3a). the nitrogen atom of this fragment also
makes a strong hydrogen bond (of 2.65 å) with a second water
molecule, w146 (fig. 3a). probably, the asymmetric center at the
carbon atom bearing the oh and chlorobenzenesulfonamide moieties, coupled with the planarity of the isoindole ring, explains the
very compact binding of  xxxd1680xxx  to the ca ii active site. indeed, most of the distances shown in table 2 and figure 3a–d are

0.10–0.17 å shorter than the corresponding ones in other such adducts, for example, with the structurally related sulfonamides
5–7.8,9,17 however, the most interesting feature of  xxxd1680xxx 
bound to ca ii regards the endocyclic carboxamido moiety present
in this sulfonamide diuretic. indeed, the oxygen atom (oa3 in the
crystallographic numbering of table 2) of this moiety participates
in two strong hydrogen bonds, one with a water molecule,
w142, of 2.83 å, and the second one with the oxygen present in
the conh2 group of asn67, of 2.70 å (figs. 2 and 3a). it is obvious
that in order to participate in both these hydrogen bonds,  xxxd1680xxx  must adopt the enolic (lactimic) tautomeric form shown
in figure 3a, when bound to the ca ii active site. this is, as far as
we know, the ﬁrst ever evidence showing that probably the biologically active form of this drug is the enolic one evidenced in this

active site.

study. for the hca ii–5 adduct, only a stacking interaction of the
benzoannulated ring of 5 with the phenyl group of phe131 and a
weak hydrogen bond (of 3.76 å) with the imidazole of his64 (in
its in conformation) were detected, when  xxxd2343xxx  is bound
within the active site (fig. 3b). as mentioned above, the corresponding moieties of  xxxd1680xxx  participate in many more
strong hydrogen bonds (of 2.54–3.16 å) with thr200, asn67 as
well as three water molecules (w142, 146, and 161), interactions
which are absent in the hca ii– xxxd2343xxx  adduct (fig. 3a). thus,
the particular enantiomeric form in which  xxxd1680xxx  4 exists
when bound to the hca ii active site, its distinct orientation and
additional three ordered water molecules explain the higher afﬁnity of this compound (18.3 times) for hca ii, as compared to  xxxd2343xxx  5. the importance of active site-ordered water molecules is
even more reinforced when examining the remaining two adducts
of hca ii with  xxxd3425xxx  6 (figs. 2 and 3c) and furosemide 7 (figs. 2 and 3d), which contain two such water molecules
each. these interactions between such water molecules, various
moieties of the inhibitor, and amino acid residues may thus explain
the higher stability of the enzyme inhibitor adducts for compounds
4, 6, and 7, which are by orders of magnitude better hca ii inhibitors as compared to the structurally related  xxxd2343xxx  5 (table
1). in particular, for the hca ii–6 complex, in addition to the zn(ii)
coordination of the sulfamoyl moiety of the inhibitor and participation in the hydrogen bond network with thr199/glu106 (table
2 and fig. 3c), the following strong polar interactions have been
evidenced: (i) three strong hydrogen bonds involving the inhibitor
endocyclic so2 moiety, with the oh of thr200, the imidazole of

his64 and the terminal amide of gln92, of 2.85–3.15 å (table 2
and fig. 3c); and (ii) three hydrogen bonds involving two water
molecules (w2043 and w2108) and the two chlorine atoms as well
as one endocyclic nh moiety of the thiadiazine ring of the inhibitor
molecule, of 2.70–3.18 å (fig. 3c). in the case of the hca ii–furosemide 7 adduct, again the benzenesulfonamide fragment of the
inhibitor is anchored to the zn(ii) ion of the enzyme active site in
a similar manner as for the previously discussed adducts of sulfonamides 4–6 (table 2 and fig. 3d), but the different substituents in
meta and para to the sulfamoyl anchor lead to very different interactions with water molecules/amino acid residues from the enzyme active site (figs. 2 and 3d). thus, the secondary amine
group makes a strong hydrogen bond with a water molecule (of
2.66 å), whereas the cooh group of furosemide (presumably a carboxylate at the ph 7.5 of the crystallization buffer) makes three
such strong hydrogen bonds, of 2.66–3.19 å (conﬁrming thus that
it is in the form coo ) with a water molecule (w2048), the oh of
thr200 and the imidazole of his64 (these two interactions were
exactly the same in the hca ii–6 adduct discussed earlier, demonstrating that the cooh moiety of furosemide 7 and the endocyclic
so2 one of  xxxd3425xxx  6 have very similar conformations
in the corresponding adducts with hca ii). this is in fact observed
also in the superposition of figure 4.
by superposing the x-ray crystal structure of the  xxxd1680xxx  4-hca ii adduct with those of the adducts of the same isoform with the structurally related diuretics 5–7, we can have
some hints regarding the diverse inhibition proﬁles of these sulfonamides against various cas, but also some insights for the de-

sign of ca ii inhibitors with improved efﬁcacy. thus, data of figs.
2 and 3 show that these structurally related sulfonamides (4–7)
make many different interactions with amino acid residues and

1219

water molecules when bound within the hca ii active site. the
main similarities for the binding of these cais to the enzyme active site regard the 2-chloro-benzenesulfonamide moiety present
in all of them. basically, the sulfonamidate zinc-binding groups
are anchored in the same manner to the metal ion and thr199
in all adducts (fig. 3a–d), with the chlorophenyl-sulfamoyl fragments of 4–7 being entirely superposable, although there are
small variations in the distance of the coordinative bond and
the hydrogen bonds (table 2 and fig. 4). this fragment of the
inhibitors occupies the channel leading from the bottom of the
ca ii active site toward the edge of the cavity, and making a host
of favorable van der waals interactions (data not shown) with
many amino acid residues lining the active site. the presence of
the chlorine atom in ortho to the sulfamoyl moiety of these inhibitors has no inﬂuence on the binding of the benzenesulfonamide
warhead to the enzyme (figs. 2–4). however, the conformation in
which the remaining elements of the scaffolds of inhibitors 4–7
bind within the ca ii active site and the interactions they make
with amino acid residues and water molecules is very different
for the four sulfonamide complexes examined here. thus, the
superposition of the four adducts shown in figure 4 demonstrates
that the protein scaffold is unchanged in these complexes,
whereas the moiety substituting in the 3-position the benzenesulfonamide scaffolds of the inhibitors lies in very different active
site regions extending toward the exit of the active site cavity.
the benzoannulated heterocycle rings of 4 and 5 are in fact almost perpendicular to each other, and they make a host of favorable interactions with amino acids/water molecules in the case of
the  xxxd1680xxx  adduct, and only two such contacts in the case
of the  xxxd2343xxx  adduct. for the  xxxd3425xxx  adduct, the
chcl2 fragment makes two strong hydrogen bonds with water
molecules and is orientated in a part of the active site in which
enough space is available to introduce various substituents, thus
possibly leading to better ca ii inhibitors. as far as we know, this
possibility has not been explored synthetically up to now. on the
other hand, the endocyclic so2 moiety of 6, similar to the cooh
moiety present in furosemide 7, participates in three strong
hydrogen bonds involving thr200 and his64 in both adducts, as
well as gln92 for 6, and a water molecule for 7. it is also interesting to note that the aminomethylfuryl group present in furosemide does not make substantial contacts with amino acid
residues, only participating in a hydrogen bond (the nh moiety)
with a water molecule. also these data allow us to propose that
by changing the nature of substituents at this secondary amine,
or by introducing various functionalities in the furane ring, it is
probable that compounds with interesting ca inhibitory properties can be obtained easily. work is in progress in this laboratory
to exploit these structural data for obtaining cais with different
inhibition proﬁles. as far as we know, this is also the ﬁrst documented case in which ordered water molecules in the enzyme
active site can lead to such a strong discrimination between
structurally related inhibitors.
as the entrance of the active site cavity in the various ca isoforms is the region with least conserved amino acid residues
among the investigated isozymes,7–13 we may also explain the
quite diverse inhibition proﬁles observed with sulfonamides 1–7
discussed here (table 1). indeed, compounds without a bulky tail
orientated toward the exit of the active site cavity, such as 1–3,
indistinctly inhibit all ca isoforms with high efﬁcacy (usually with
inhibition constants <100 nm), leading to promiscuous, unselective
cais. on the contrary, compound possessing such bulkier moieties,
which bind toward the exit/edge of the active site cavity (such as
4–7) and may thus interact differently with the various amino acid
residues present in those regions, does indeed show some levels of
selectivity or inhibiting certain ca isozymes, as exempliﬁed here
by the three discussed sulfonamides 4–7. however, as the x-ray

1220

c. temperini et al. / bioorg. med. chem. 17 (2009) 1214–1221

crystal structure is not available yet for all ca isoforms (i.e., ca vb,
vi, vii, ix, xiii, and xv)7 the nature and number of these amino acid
residues responsible for the selective inhibition of all ca isozymes
are still unknown.
3. conclusions
we reinvestigated the ca inhibitory activity of some thiazide,
widely clinically used sulfonamide type diuretics. these compounds
inhibit all mammalian ca isoforms but with a very different proﬁle
as compared to classical inhibitors, such as acetazolamide,  xxxd2592xxx , and  xxxd2058xxx . some of these diuretics have a very different behavior against the widespread isozyme ca ii, with
 xxxd1680xxx ,  xxxd3425xxx , and furosemide being efﬁcient
inhibitors against ca ii (kis of 65–138 nm), whereas  xxxd2343xxx  is a
much weaker one (ki of 2520 nm). furthermore, some diuretics are
quite efﬁcient (low nanomolar) inhibitors of other isoforms, for
example,  xxxd1680xxx  against hca vb, vii, ix, and xiii;  xxxd2343xxx  against ca vii, ix, xii, and xiii,  xxxd3425xxx  against
ca vii and ix, and furosemide against ca i and xiv. examining the
four x-ray crystal structures of their ca ii adducts, we observed several (2–4) active site water molecules interacting with the  xxxd1680xxx ,  xxxd3425xxx , and furosemide scaffolds which may be
responsible for this important difference of activity. indeed,  xxxd2343xxx  bound to ca ii has no interactions with active site water molecules.  xxxd1680xxx  bound within the ca ii active site is in an enolic
(lactimic) tautomeric form, with the enolic oh also participating in
two strong hydrogen bonds with asn67 and a water molecule. the
newly evidenced binding modes of these diuretics may be exploited
for designing better ca ii inhibitors as well as compounds with selectivity/afﬁnity for various isoforms with medicinal chemistry
applications.
4. experimental
4.1. materials
sulfonamides 1–7 are commercially available compounds (from
sigma–aldrich, milan, italy). the twelve ca isozymes used in the
experiments were recombinant ones obtained and puriﬁed as reported earlier by this group.18–22
4.2. ca inhibition assay
an applied photophysics (oxford, uk) stopped-ﬂow instrument
has been used for assaying the ca-catalyzed co2 hydration activity.
phenol red (at a concentration of 0.2 mm) has been used as indicator,
working at the absorbance maximum of 557 nm, with 10 mm hepes
(ph 7.5) as buffer, 0.1 m na2so4 (for maintaining the ionic strength
constant), following the ca-catalyzed co2 hydration reaction.23 the
co2 concentrations ranged from 1.7 to 17 mm for the determination
of the kinetic parameters and inhibition constants. for each inhibitor
at least six traces of the initial 5–10% of the reaction have been used
for determining the initial velocity. the uncatalyzed rates were
determined in the same manner and subtracted from the total observed rates. stock solutions of inhibitor (10 mm) were prepared
in distilled–deionized water with 10–20% (v/v) dmso (which is
not inhibitory at these concentrations), and dilutions up to
0.01 lm were done thereafter with distilled–deionized water. inhibitor and enzyme solutions were preincubated together for 15 min at
room temperature prior to assay, in order to allow for the formation
of the e-i complex. the inhibition constants were obtained by nonlinear least-squares methods using prism 3, and represent the mean
from at least three different determinations.23

4.3. x-ray crystallography
the hca ii–4 adduct was crystallized as previously described.8,17 diffraction data were collected under cryogenic conditions (100 k) on a ccd detector km4 ccd/sapphire using cu ka
radiation (1.5418 å). the unit cell dimensions were determined
to be a = 41.4 å, b = 42.1 å, c = 72.3 å and a = c = 90°, b = 104.3° in
the space group p21. data were processed with crysalis red
(oxford diffraction 2006).24 the structure was analyzed by difference fourier technique, using the pdb ﬁle 1ca2 as starting model.
the reﬁnement was carried out with the program refmac5;25 model
building, and map inspections were performed using the coot program.26 the ﬁnal model of the complex  xxxg293xxx / xxxd2343xxx  had an
r-factor of 22.8% and r-free 29.0% in the resolution range 20.0–
2.1 å, with an rms deviation from standard geometry of 0.015 å
in bond lengths and 1.8° in angles. the correctness of stereochemistry was ﬁnally checked using procheck.27 coordinates and
structure factors have been deposited with the protein data bank
(accession code 3f4x).
