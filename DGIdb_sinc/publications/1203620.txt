i  xxxd159xxx  was found to be a potent inhibitor in vitro of gastric histamine
methyltransferase from human and canine corpus and from pig antrum. the idso for the
enzyme, purified from pig antrum mucosa by ultracentrifugation and chromatography on
deae-cellulose, was 2.5 gm.
2 in six dogs with heidenhain pouches the maximum secretory response to histamine
(40,ug/kg i.m.) was augmented by i.m. injection of  xxxd159xxx . the augmentation depended
on the dose of  xxxd159xxx , the optimum effect (40% increase in volume of gastric juice, 80%
in acid output) being achieved with 2 mg/kg. the maximum secretory response to  xxxd324xxx  was
also enhanced by  xxxd159xxx .
3 it was suggested that  xxxd159xxx  may enhance the histamine and  xxxd324xxx  stimulated
gastric secretion by an inhibition of gastric histamine methyltransferase in vivo.

introduction

the stimulation of gastric acid secretion by
pharmacological doses of histamine, the
occurrence of histamine both in gastric juice and
tissue and the release of histamine by gastrin in the
rat gastric mucosa predominantly support the
hypothesis that histamine is a physiological
stimulator of gastric secretion (code, 1956;
kahlson, rosengren, svahn & thunberg, 1964;
lorenz & pfleger, 1968). although this hypothesis
has been rejected by several authors (grossman,
1967; johnson, 1971), others have continued to
defend the idea that histamine may be the
common mediator for the action of gastrin and
acetylcholine on the parietal cell (code, maslifnski,
mossini & navert, 1971; kahlson & rosengren,
1971). these differences in opinion were based on
disagreements about subordinate elements in the
hypothesis: adequate localization of histamine in
the mucosa (pro: thunberg, 1967; contra:
hakanson, 1970), release of histamine during
physiological stimulation of acid secretion (pro:
kahlson et al., 1964; contra: hakanson, 1970) and
formation of histamine in the gastric mucosa
of various mammalian species (pro: kahlson
et al., 1964; lorenz, halbach, gerant & werle,

1969; contra: aures, davidson & hakanson,
1969).
however, there is good agreement about the
inactivation of histamine in the stomach. high
activities of histamine methyltransferase (sadenosyl-methionine:
 xxxg1066xxx ;  xxxg1066xxx ) were demonstrated in man and
all animals investigated (brown, tomchick &
axelrod, 1959; lorenz, barth & werle, 1970a),
but no, or only a very low, activity of diamine
oxidase (diamine: oxygen-oxidoreductase ec
1.4.3.6) could be measured in the gastric mucosa
of various mammals, including rats, dogs and cows
(kusche, lorenz, hahn & werle, 1969; for a
review see lorenz et al., 1970a).
therefore we attempted to find a potent
inhibitor of gastric histamine methyltransferase in
vitro and then to investigate its effect on
histamine-stimulated gastric secretion; the
antimalarial drug  xxxd159xxx  was already known
to be an inhibitor of this enzyme from the rat
kidney (cohn, 1965). a preliminary report of our
findings has been published (troidl, lorenz, barth,
seidel, rohde, goecke, schmal & hamelmann,
1972).

methods

cannula for the heidenhain pouch experiments

source and preparation of histamine methyltransferase

the experiments were planned to last many
months and so, to minimize the risk of technical
failure, a special tissue-sparing corrosion-resistant
cannula was developed based on the approved
models of dragstedt, haymond & ellis (1933),
gregory (1950) and devito & harkins (1959).
this cannula consisted of a stainless steel tube
placed on a shaft of polypropylene. a relatively
broad plexiglass disk, pushed over the stainless
steel tube, was fixed on one side by the
polypropylene shaft and on the other side by the
interior surface of the abdominal wall (emas,
swan & jacobson, 1967). the disk was intended
to shunt off the strong pulling and shearing forces
which act occasionally on the exterior part of the
cannula in the lying animal and so prevent the
cannula from breaking out of the pouch.

gastric mucosa from duodenal ulcer patients
(treated by a billroth ii gastrectomy), from dogs
(laboratory animals) or from pigs (slaughter house)
was rinsed with ice-cold tyrode solution
immediately after removal of the stomach. the
mucosa was stripped off from the muscular layer,
frozen with dry ice and then stored at -20o c for
several days.
crude extracts of histamine methyltransferase
were prepared by homogenizing the frozen tissues
with 2 vol 0.25 m sucrose solution. the
homogenate was centrifuged at 20 c and
l00,000x g for 30 min and the supernatant was
used as the source of the enzyme. histamine
methyltransferase from pig antrum mucosa was
partially purified by applying the crude extract to
a column of deae-cellulose (lorenz, reimann,
barth, kusche, meyer, doenicke & hutzel, 1972).
the fractions containing the highest enzyme
activities were combined and used directly for
incubation. the purification of this enzyme
preparation was 22-fold as compared with the
crude homogenate, the specific activity being
4.04 nmol/(min x mg protein) with a yield of 74%.
the proteins were determined according to lowry,
rosebrough, farr & randall (1951).

reagents
histamine dihydrochloride puriss. (fluka, buchs);
2,5-diphenyloxazole (ppo), 2,2'-p-phenylene-bis(5-phenyloxazole) (popop) and toluene (all
scintillation grade), isoamylalcohol p.a., d (+)sucrose puriss., nicotinamide p.a., folin-ciocalteu's phenol reagent, 0.1 n sodium hydroxide
solution (titrisol), all inorganic salts, acids and
bases p.a. (merck, darmstadt); s-adenosyl-l-( "4cmethyl)-methionine (0.51 mci/mmol) (the radiochemical centre, amersham); s-adenosyl-lmethionine hydrogen sulphate (boehringer,
mannheim);  xxxd159xxx  (kindly supplied by r.
wolf, parke & davies, munich); deae-cellulose-ss
p.a. (serva, heidelberg). all solutions were
prepared with twice-distilled water.

drugs

sterile solutions of histamine dihydrochloride and
 xxxd159xxx  were prepared by the university's
pharmacy;  xxxd324xxx  dihydrochloride ( xxxd324xxx ,
lilly, giessen); insulin (hoechst, frankfurt).

determination of histamine methyltransferase
activity in vitro
the enzyme activity was determined by the
isotope assay of barth, lorenz & niemeyer
(1 973a)
using
s-adenosyl-l-[ 14c-methylj methionine as the methyl-group donor.
 xxxd159xxx , dissolved in 0.1 ml of 0.05m
sodium phosphate buffer at ph 7.4, was added to
the incubation mixture, which contained
32-48 nmol histamine, 250 nmol s-adenos1y-lmethionine, 100 nmol s-adenosyl-l-[methyl 44c]
methionine and 22.5 ,mol phosphate buffer,
ph 7.4. the final volume of the incubation
mixture was 0.5 ml. the incubation was stopped
after 0, 15, 30, 45 and 60 min by the addition of
borate buffer, ph 10.0.
the reaction product, [ 4c1-l-(,r)-methylhistamine, was extracted into a mixture of toluene and
isoamylalcohol. after the addition of scintillant,
an aliquot was counted in a tri carb liquid
scintillation spectrometer. the formation of
1 nmol of 1-methylhistamine corresponded to
1 14 ct/minute. the observed specific activities of
histamine methyltransferase lay between 98 and
574 pmol/(min x mg protein), corresponding to
counts of values of 1470-4350 ct/min over
60 minutes. depending on incubation time, the
blanks with heat-inactivated enzyme showed
values of 80-150 ct/min over 60 min above the
background of 30 ct/minute.

number of tests
figure 1 enhancement of the histamine-stimulated gastric secretion in a heidenhain pouch dog by
 xxxd159xxx . from the test programme 11 weeks are shown, including the intial tests for reproducibility, several
doses of histamine and of  xxxd159xxx  according to the test procedure (see test). histamine is expressed as
histamine dihydrochloride. the results are those for total gastric secretion (volume and acid output/secretion
period). dog no. 2, male, 23.5 kg at the time of operation (12.7.1971). o volume, a acid output. for futher
conditions see methods section.

investigated in six mongrel dogs (20-30 kg, both
sexes) with heidenhain pouches. the preparation
of these pouches, the supervision of the dogs after
the operation and during the test period, and the
experimental design for the stimulation of gastric
secretion by secretagogue alone or by secretagogue
and amodiquine (cf. figure 1) in serial tests were
performed as described by troidl, lorenz, barth,
rohde, feifel, schmal, goecke, reimann-huhnd
& seidel (1973).
additionally every six months, insulin
(0.2 i.u./kg) was used to check the lack of vagal
reinnervation of the pouches. during the first
90 min of this test the blood sugar concentration
was determined every 15 min by the glucose
oxidase assay (boehringer-kit, mannheim). the
result of the insulin test was only considered to be
satisfactory if the glucose concentration fell
to values between 30 and 10 mg/l100 ml blood
(baron, 1970).
the procedure for a single test was the same as
described by troidl et al. (1973), using 40,ug/kg
histamine or 2 mg/kg  xxxd324xxx  instead of
 xxxd2873xxx . gastric juice was collected in
30 min-portions for 2.5 to 3 h, after which time in
all experiments the basal secretion plateau was
attained. determination of the volume and the
acidity of each sample was carried out as described
by troidl et al. (1973).

definitions
the maximum secretory response to histamine and
 xxxd324xxx  was defined by two parameters, the total
secretion and the peak secretion. the total
secretion consisted of all fractions of gastric juice
obtained within the 2.5 to 3 h of secretion and
was expressed as ml and meq/secretion period.
the peak secretion was represented by those two
consecutive 30 min fractions, irrespective of time,
which showed the greatest volumes and acid
outputs and was expressed in ml and meq/hour.
the effect of  xxxd159xxx  was expressed as the
ratio of the results of the single test with
 xxxd159xxx  plus stimulant to the average results
of the two control tests without  xxxd159xxx 
(troidl et al., 1973). augmentation or inhibition
of the stimulated secretion by  xxxd159xxx  was
expressed as a percentage, because the variation of
the secretion values was relatively high from
animal to animal.
statistical calculations
statistical calculations (snedecor & cochran,
1967) including those of mean values, coefficient
of variation, standard deviations and tests for
statistical significance (student's t-test or t-test for
paired data) were performed with the aid of a desk
computer (olivetti programma 102).

results
inhibition of gastric histamine methyltransferase
by  xxxd159xxx  in vitro

 xxxd159xxx  was found to be a very potent
inhibitor of histamine methyltransferase from
human and canine corpus mucosa and from pig
antrum mucosa (figure 2). the id50 value using
pig enzyme was smaller by one order of magnitude
than found with the enzymes from man or dog.
crude and partially purified enzyme preparations
were inhibited by  xxxd159xxx  to the same extent,
since the id50 for histamine methyltransferase
following chromatography on deae-cellulose was
2.5 gm (cf. figure 2). a 30 min preincubation of
 xxxd159xxx  and the enzyme at 370 c enhanced
the inhibitory effect by 20% at inhibitor
concentrations smaller than 50 mm.
effect of  xxxd159xxx  on the histamine and
 xxxd324xxx  stimulated gastric secretion in heidenhain
pouch dogs
in six dogs, the maximum secretory response to
histamine (40 ag/kg i.m.) showed an excellent
reproducibility (for an example see figure 1). the

the

total gastric secretion

(figure 3). the optimum dose was 2 mg/kg which
enhanced the volume of gastric juice by 40% and
the acid output by 80%. a higher dose of
 xxxd159xxx  (3 mg/kg) produced a less marked
increase and in three dogs, 5 mg/kg inhibited the
total gastric secretion by about 50%. weakness and
apathy were observed in these dogs indicating that
this dose was toxic (lorenz, thermann, messmer,
schmal, dormann, kusche, barth, tauber, hutzel,
mann & uhlig, 1974).  xxxd159xxx  augmented
the peak secretion (24 ± 9 ml/h, 2.8 ± 1.0 meq/h)
and the total secretion to the same degree. in all

 xxxd159xxx  and gastric function

experiments,  xxxd159xxx  (2 mg/kg) enhanced the
peak volume of gastric juice by 37 ± 18%, the peak
acid output by 82 ± 31 %. the total volume of the
gastric juice increased by 36 ± 16%, the total acid
output by 80 ± 33%. this indicates that
histamine-stimulated gastric secretion was
enhanced but not prolonged by  xxxd159xxx . the
secretion period following stimulation was
120-150 min both in experiments with histamine
alone and in those using the combined stimulation
by histamine plus  xxxd159xxx .
the histamine isomer  xxxd324xxx , which has been
used as a stimulator of human gastric sectretion
(feifel, lorenz, heimann & worsching, 1972) was
administered in two dogs in combination with
 xxxd159xxx . in four experiments, the maximum
gastric secretion evoked by 2 mg/kg i.m.  xxxd324xxx 
(total volume 68 ml, total acid output
7.5 meq/secretion period), was enhanced by
24 ± 10% (volume) and 45 ± 18% (acid output)
after  xxxd159xxx  (2 mg/kg). the augmentation of
the peak secretion by  xxxd159xxx  did not differ
significantly from that of the total secretion.

discussion

antimalarial drugs derived from 4-aminoquinoline
were reported to be potent in vitro inhibitors of
 xxxg487xxx  (spector, personal
communication; see cohn, 1965) and histamine
methyltransferase from rat kidney (cohn, 1965).
the id50 values were smaller by 1-3 orders of
magnitude than those of other inhibitors of the
latter enzyme, such as 1-(r)-methylhistamine (brown
et al, 1959; lindahl, 1960; barth et al., 1973a),
5-hydroxytryptamine (brown et al., 1959;
gustafsson & forshell, 1964), chlorpromazine and
bromolysergic acid diethylamide (brown et al.,
1959), cu2-ions (lindahl, 1960; gustafsson &
forshell, 1964), antihistamines of the h1 -receptor
type (netter & bodenschatz, 1967; cohn & wynn,
1968; barth, niemeyer & lorenz, 1973b, c) and
h2-receptor antagonists (barth et al, 1973b, c).
we have now shown that  xxxd159xxx  is a potent
inhibitor of histamine methyltransferase of the
gastric tissue of man, dog and pig.
in vivo, investigations on the inhibition of
histamine methyltransferase by  xxxd159xxx  were
performed in rats by studying the daily excretion
-of histamine in the urine (cohn, 1966; kim &
cohn, 1966). the increase of the histamine
excretion which was observed has to be
interpreted primarily as an inhibition of the renal
histamine methyltransferase, since high activities
of this enzyme were found in rat kidneys.

325

however, these findings emphasized that
 xxxd159xxx  was capable of inhibiting the
histamine methyltransferase in vivo. therefore, the
enhancement by  xxxd159xxx  of gastric secretion
in dogs stimulated by histamine, or  xxxd324xxx  which
releases histamine (stubrin, dyce, brem, tecimer
& haverback, 1965; lorenz, feifel, schmal,
hutzel & werle, 1970b) may be explained as an
inhibition of the high activities of this enzyme in
the fundic and corpus mucosa (lorenz et al.,
1 970a).
it has previously been shown that
 xxxd2873xxx -stimulated secretion is also augmented by  xxxd159xxx  (troidl et al., 1972, 1973).
studies on the in vivo inhibition of gastric
histamine methyltransferase by agents other than
 xxxd159xxx  were performed in rats by amure &
ginsburg (1964a, b), using chlorpromazine and
bromolysergic acid diethylamide and by
haverback, stubrin & dyce (1965), who administered 5-hydroxytryptamine and 1-(-r)-methylhistamine to dogs with a total stomach gastric
fistula. both groups of authors described an
augmentation of the histamine- and gastrinstimulated acid secretion by the previously
mentioned agents. but histamine methyltransferase is absent in the gastric mucosa of rats
(brown et al., 1959; kim, backus, harris &
rourke, 1969), and haverback et al. (1965) used
very small doses of the drugs (0.5-1.0 ug kgmin-'), which are far below that of id50 for an
inhibition of histamine methyltransferase in vitro
(brown et al., 1959). thus it is not clear by which
mechanism the drugs mentioned above enhanced
gastric acid secretion.
the question whether the enhancement of the
histamine-stimulated acid secretion by  xxxd159xxx 
was the result of a local inhibition of histamine
methyltransferase or of a general delay in
histamine inactivation can partly be answered by
determining the elimination-rate of exogenously
administered histamine from dog's plasma after
the injection of  xxxd159xxx . applied in doses of
2.5 and 5.0 mg/kg this compound did not protract
histamine elimination from the plasma (lorenz et
al., 1974). furthermore,  xxxd159xxx  did not
release histamine (lorenz et al., 1974). thus,
 xxxd159xxx  seemed to enhance gastric acid
secretion by inhibiting histamine methyltransferase in the glandular part of the canine mucosa,
but not by influencing the concentrations of
histamine in the systemic circulation.
however, explanations for the effect of  xxxd159xxx  on gastric secretion other than inhibition
of gastric histamine methyltransferase, have to be
considered. a direct action on the parietal cell due
to calcium mobilization or to influences on the
system of cyclic nucleotides can largely be

326

h. barth, w. lorenz & h. troidl

excluded since  xxxd159xxx  does not cause acid
secretion when given alone (troidl et al., 1973).
vagal stimulation by  xxxd159xxx  seems unlikely
for the same reason because prostigmine and
carbachol elicited a considerable gastric secretion

in the same animals in which  xxxd159xxx  was
completely ineffective (troidl et al., 1973).
we wish to thank dr k. goecke and dr h. rohde for their
skilful assistance. this work was supported by a grant from
the deutsche forschungsgemeinschaft (lo 199/3).
