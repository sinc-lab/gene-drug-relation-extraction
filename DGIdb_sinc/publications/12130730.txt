abstract
life-threatening drug interactions are known to occur between
methotrexate and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs
(nsaids), probenecid, and  xxxd2871xxx . the purpose of this
study was to characterize methotrexate transport, as well as to
determine the site and the mechanism of drug interactions in
the proximal tubule. mouse proximal tubule cells stably expressing basolateral human organic anion transporters ( xxxg2113xxx 
and  xxxg2115xxx ) and apical hoat ( xxxg2109xxx ) were established. the
km values for  xxxg2113xxx -,  xxxg2115xxx -, and  xxxg2109xxx -mediated methotrexate uptake were 553.8 ␮m, 21.1 ␮m, and 17.8 ␮m, respectively. nsaids (salicylate, ibuprofen,  xxxd2423xxx , phenylbutazone,  xxxd2969xxx , and indomethacin), probenecid, and penicillin
g dose dependently inhibited methotrexate uptake mediated
by  xxxg2113xxx ,  xxxg2115xxx , and  xxxg2109xxx . kinetic analysis of inhibitory
effects of these drugs on  xxxg2115xxx -mediated methotrexate up-

methotrexate is widely used at high dosages in the treatment of malignancies, whereas it is used at low dosages in
rheumatoid arthritis. methotrexate is eliminated almost entirely in an unchanged form in urine, which involves glomerular filtration and active tubular secretion (shen and azarnoff, 1978). therefore, renal insufficiency or drug
interactions, which reduce the clearance of methotrexate, are
potentially toxic events.
interactions between methotrexate and drugs including
nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (nsaids), probenecid,
and  xxxd2871xxx  have been reported by several groups of
investigators (ellison and servi, 1985; thyss et al., 1986;
basin et al., 1991; frenia and long, 1992; tracy et al., 1992;
this study was supported in part by grants-in-aid from the ministry of
education, sports, science and technology (11671048, 11694310, and
13671128), the science research promotion fund of the japan private school
promotion foundation, and research on health sciences focusing on drug
innovation from japan health sciences foundation.

take revealed that these inhibitions were competitive. the ki
values for the effects of salicylate, phenylbutazone, indomethacin, and probenecid on  xxxg2115xxx -mediated methotrexate uptake
were comparable with therapeutically relevant plasma concentrations of unbound drugs. in addition, in the presence of
human  xxxg124xxx , the ki values were comparable with
therapeutically relevant total plasma concentrations of drugs. in
conclusion, these results suggest that methotrexate is taken up
via  xxxg2115xxx  and  xxxg2113xxx  at the basolateral side of the proximal
tubule and effluxed or taken up at the apical side via  xxxg2109xxx . in
addition,  xxxg2113xxx ,  xxxg2115xxx , and  xxxg2109xxx  are the sites of drug
interactions between methotrexate and nsaids, probenecid,
and  xxxd2871xxx . furthermore, it was predicted that  xxxg2115xxx  is
the site of drug interactions between methotrexate and salicylate, phenylbutazone, indomethacin, and probenecid in vivo.

kremer and hamilton, 1995). severe and even life-threatening interactions have been observed, including bone marrow
suppression and acute renal failure (ellison and servi, 1985;
thyss et al., 1986; basin et al., 1991; frenia and long, 1992).
the interactions may have been caused by protein binding
displacement, inhibitory effects on the renal secretion of
methotrexate, and a decline in glomerular filtration as a
result of inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis (tracy et al.,
1992; kremer and hamilton, 1995). among these possible
causes, the renal tubular secretion of methotrexate has been
thought to be a major site for drug interaction (frenia and
long, 1992).
two different types of human multispecific oats ( xxxg2113xxx 
and  xxxg2115xxx ) were recently isolated (reid et al., 1998; hosoyamada et al., 1999; cha et al., 2001). in the kidney,  xxxg2113xxx 
and  xxxg2115xxx  are localized at the basolateral membrane of the
proximal tubule (hosoyamada et al., 1999; cha et al., 2001).
since  xxxg2113xxx  and  xxxg2115xxx  mediate the transport of various
drugs, endogenous substances, and xenobiotics, these transporters are considered to be responsible for the basolateral

other hand, oat-k1 (saito et al., 1996; masuda et al.,
1999b), oat-k2 (masuda et al., 1999a),  xxxg2109xxx  (cha et al.,
2000), organic anion-transporting peptide 1 ( xxxg2163xxx ) (jacquemin et al., 1994), oatp3 (abe et al., 1998), multidrug-resistance protein 2 ( xxxg15xxx ) (leier et al., 2000), and human type
i sodium-dependent inorganic phosphate transporter (npt1)
(uchino et al., 2000) were isolated and identified as transporters of anionic drugs and substances at the apical membrane of the proximal tubule.
the purpose of this study was to characterize methotrexate
transport in the proximal tubule, as well as to determine the
site and mechanism of interactions between methotrexate
and nsaids, probenecid, and  xxxd2871xxx  using the second
portion of the proximal tubule (s2) cells stably expressing
 xxxg2113xxx ,  xxxg2115xxx , and  xxxg2109xxx  (s2  xxxg2113xxx , s2  xxxg2115xxx , and s2
 xxxg2109xxx , respectively).

materials. [ h]methotrexate (547.6 gbq/mmol) was purchased
from amersham biosciences uk, ltd. (little chalfont, buckinghamshire, uk). methotrexate, various nsaids, probenecid,  xxxd2871xxx ,
transferrin, and human  xxxg124xxx  were obtained from sigma
chemical co. (st. louis, mo). other materials used included fetal
bovine serum, trypsin and  xxxd2191xxx  from invitrogen (carlsbad, ca),
recombinant  xxxg681xxx  from wakunaga (hiroshima,
japan), insulin from shimizu (shizuoka, japan), ritc 80 –7 culture
medium from iwaki co. (tokyo, japan), and tfx-50 from promega
(madison, wi).
cell culture and establishment of s2  xxxg2113xxx , s2  xxxg2115xxx , and
s2  xxxg2109xxx . s2 cells, derived from transgenic mice harboring temperature-sensitive simian virus 40 large t-antigen gene, were established as described previously by us (takeda et al., 1999). s2 is the
segment of the proximal tubule in which  xxxg2113xxx ,  xxxg2115xxx , and
 xxxg2109xxx  were localized (hosoyamada et al., 1999; cha et al., 2001;
babu et al., 2002). the full-length cdnas of  xxxg2113xxx ,  xxxg2115xxx , and
 xxxg2109xxx  were subcloned into pcdna 3.1 (invitrogen, carlsbad, ca), a
mammalian expression vector. s2  xxxg2113xxx , s2  xxxg2115xxx , and s2  xxxg2109xxx 
were obtained by transfecting s2 cells with pcdna3.1- xxxg2113xxx ,
pcdna3.1- xxxg2115xxx , and pcdna3.1- xxxg2109xxx  coupled with psv2neo, a
neomycin-resistant gene, using tfx-50 according to the manufacturer’s instructions. s2 cells transfected with pcdna3.1 lacking an
insert, and psv2neo were designated as s2 pcdna 3.1 and used as a
control (mock). these cells were grown in a humidified incubator at
33°c and under 5% co2 using ritc 80 –7 medium containing 5%
fetal bovine serum, 10 ␮g/ml transferrin, 0.08 u/ml insulin, 10 ng/ml
recombinant  xxxg681xxx , and 400 ␮g/ml  xxxd2191xxx . the
cells were subcultured in a medium containing 0.05% trypsin-edta
solution (containing 137 mm nacl, 5.4 mm kcl, 5.5 mm glucose, 4
mm nahco3, 0.5 mm edta, and 5 mm hepes, ph 7.2) and used for
10 to ⬃35 passages. clonal cells were isolated using a cloning cylinder and screened by determining the uptake of the optimal substrate
for each transporter, i.e., para-[14c]aminohippuric acid for  xxxg2113xxx 
(hosoyamada et al., 1999) and [3h] xxxd2046xxx  for  xxxg2115xxx  (cha et
al., 2001) and  xxxg2109xxx  (cha et al., 2000). the s2 monolayer was
determined to be leaky, based on the results of a study in which we
estimated paracellular secretion from cells cultured on a permeable
support, using d-[3h]mannitol as an indicator. in addition, vertical
sections of s2  xxxg2113xxx , s2  xxxg2115xxx , and s2  xxxg2109xxx  stained with polyclonal antibodies against  xxxg2113xxx ,  xxxg2115xxx , and  xxxg2109xxx , respectively,
showed that the subcellular localization of  xxxg2113xxx ,  xxxg2115xxx , and
 xxxg2109xxx  proteins was mainly on the cell membrane. both the basolateral and apical portions of the membrane showed positive staining. therefore, the cells were cultured on a solid support for these
experiments.

uptake experiments. uptake experiments were performed as
previously described (takeda et al., 1999). as described above, the
cells were cultured at 33°c, which is suitable for cell growth for cells
encoding temperature-sensitive simian virus 40 large t-antigen gene
(takeda et al., 1999). in contrast, uptake experiments were performed at 37°c, which is commonly used for evaluating transporter
activities. there was no difference in the amount of uptake between
33°c and 37°c (data not shown). based on these results, the cells
were cultured at 33°c, whereas uptake experiments were performed
at 37°c. the s2 cells were seeded in 24-well tissue culture plates at
a cell density of 1 ⫻ 105cells/well. after the cells were cultured for 2
days, the cells were washed three times with dulbecco’s modified
phosphate-buffered saline (d-pbs) solution (containing 137 mm
nacl, 3 mm kcl, 8 mm nahpo4, 1 mm kh2po4, 1 mm cacl2, and
0.5 mm mgcl2, ph 7.4), and then preincubated in the same solution
for 10 min in a water bath at 37°c. the cells were then incubated in
d-pbs containing [3h]methotrexate at various concentrations as
indicated in each experiment. the uptake was stopped by the addition of ice-cold d-pbs, and the cells were washed three times with
the same solution. the cells in each well were lysed with 0.5 ml of 0.1
n sodium hydroxide and 2.5 ml of aquasol-2, and radioactivity was
determined using a ␤-scintillation counter (aloka, tokyo, japan;
lsc-3100).
inhibition study. to evaluate the inhibitory effects of various
nsaids, probenecid, and  xxxd2871xxx  on methotrexate uptake mediated by  xxxg2113xxx ,  xxxg2115xxx , and  xxxg2109xxx , s2  xxxg2113xxx , s2  xxxg2115xxx , and s2
 xxxg2109xxx  were incubated in a solution containing [3h]methotrexate in
the absence or presence of various drugs at 37°c. considering the km
values for  xxxg2113xxx -,  xxxg2115xxx -, and  xxxg2109xxx -mediated methotrexate uptake,  xxxg2113xxx -,  xxxg2115xxx -, and  xxxg2109xxx -mediated methotrexate uptake
was estimated using a methotrexate concentration of 1 ␮m ( xxxg2113xxx )
or 100 nm ( xxxg2115xxx  and  xxxg2109xxx ). in addition, based on the results of
time course experiments (fig. 1),  xxxg2115xxx -mediated methotrexate
uptake was evaluated during the 2-min incubation. on the other
hand, since the specific methotrexate uptake activity, represented as
the amount of  xxxg2113xxx - and  xxxg2109xxx -mediated methotrexate uptake
subtracted by that by mock, was about two times larger during the
15-min incubation than that during the 2-min incubation, we chose
15 min as the incubation time for the inhibition experiments. salicylate, probenecid, and  xxxd2871xxx  were dissolved in distilled water.
ibuprofen,  xxxd2423xxx , phenylbutazone,  xxxd2969xxx , and indomethacin were dissolved in  xxxd1896xxx  and diluted with the incubation medium. the final concentration of  xxxd1896xxx  in the
incubation medium was adjusted to less than 1%.
kinetic analysis. after preincubation as described above, s2
 xxxg2115xxx  was incubated in d-pbs containing [3h]methotrexate at
different concentrations in the absence or presence of various drugs
for 2 min. for the kinetic analysis of inhibitory effects, double reciprocal plot analyses were performed based on methotrexate under
each condition (apiwattanakul et al., 1999). when the inhibition was
competitive, the ki values were calculated based on the following

containing 1 ␮m methotrexate ( xxxg2113xxx ) or 100 nm methotrexate ( xxxg2115xxx  and  xxxg2109xxx ) for various periods at 37°c. as
shown in fig. 1, when the amount of methotrexate uptake in
mock was subtracted from those in s2  xxxg2113xxx , s2  xxxg2115xxx , and
s2  xxxg2109xxx , the specific uptake in s2  xxxg2113xxx  (fig. 1a) and s2
 xxxg2109xxx  (fig. 1c) increased in a time-dependent manner and
reached steady state, whereas that in s2  xxxg2115xxx  (fig. 1b)
decreased after reaching peak. the latter may be due to the
observation that nonspecific methotrexate efflux overwhelmed  xxxg2115xxx -mediated methotrexate uptake depending
on the nature of monoclonal cells into which  xxxg2115xxx  cdna
was transfected.
the kinetics of methotrexate uptake was examined to evaluate the pharmacological characteristics of  xxxg2113xxx ,  xxxg2115xxx ,
and  xxxg2109xxx  on methotrexate transport. the concentrationdependent uptake of methotrexate was observed in s2
 xxxg2113xxx , s2  xxxg2115xxx , and s2  xxxg2109xxx  after subtraction of uptake
by mock (data not shown). as shown in fig. 2, eadie-hofstee
plot analysis of  xxxg2113xxx -,  xxxg2115xxx -, and  xxxg2109xxx -mediated
methotrexate uptake gave a single straight line. the estimated km values of methotrexate uptake by  xxxg2113xxx ,  xxxg2115xxx ,
and  xxxg2109xxx  were 553.8 ⫾ 43.2 ␮m, 21.1 ⫾ 2.8 ␮m, and 17.8 ⫾
1.6 ␮m, respectively (from three determinations in one typical experiment of two separate experiments). these results
suggest that  xxxg2113xxx ,  xxxg2115xxx , and  xxxg2109xxx  mediate transport
of methotrexate.

inhibitory effects on methotrexate uptake. we examined the effects of various drugs on methotrexate uptake
mediated by  xxxg2113xxx ,  xxxg2115xxx , and  xxxg2109xxx . the drugs used
were nsaids (salicylate, ibuprofen,  xxxd2423xxx , phenylbutazone,  xxxd2969xxx , and indomethacin), probenecid, and  xxxd2871xxx . these drugs inhibited methotrexate uptake mediated
by  xxxg2113xxx ,  xxxg2115xxx , and  xxxg2109xxx  in a dose-dependent manner,
whereas  xxxd2871xxx  did not inhibit  xxxg2113xxx -mediated methotrexate uptake and salicylate did not inhibit  xxxg2109xxx -mediated methotrexate uptake (data not shown). the effects of
these nsaids on methotrexate uptake by  xxxg2113xxx ,  xxxg2115xxx ,
and  xxxg2109xxx  are listed in table 1.
kinetic analysis of inhibition. to further elucidate the
inhibitory effects of nsaids, probenecid, and  xxxd2871xxx  on
 xxxg2115xxx -mediated methotrexate uptake, we have examined
the inhibitory effects of these drugs at different concentrations of methotrexate. typical results are shown in fig. 3.

(fig. 3a), phenylbutazone (fig. 3b), indomethacin (fig. 3c),
and probenecid (fig. 3d) on the  xxxg2115xxx -mediated methotrexate uptake demonstrated that these drugs inhibited the
methotrexate uptake in a competitive manner. the inhibitory effects of ibuprofen,  xxxd2423xxx ,  xxxd2969xxx , and  xxxd2871xxx  were also competitive (data not shown). the ki values

uptake in s2  xxxg2115xxx . methotrexate uptake was measured at various
concentrations of [3h]methotrexate in the presence or absence of various
drugs (a, salicylate; b, phenylbutazone; c, indomethacin; and d, probenecid) for 2 min at 37°c, and lineweaver-burk plot analyses were performed. the values for the uptake in mock were subtracted from those in
s2  xxxg2115xxx . each value represents the mean ⫾ s.e. of four determinations

performed a kinetic analysis of the inhibitory effects of salicylate, phenylbutazone, indomethacin, and probenecid on
 xxxg2115xxx -mediated methotrexate uptake in the presence of 5%
human  xxxg124xxx . the inhibitory effects of these drugs
on  xxxg2115xxx -mediated methotrexate uptake in the presence of
5% human  xxxg124xxx  were also competitive, and the ki

discussion
 xxxg2113xxx  and  xxxg2115xxx  were recently cloned and characterized
as multispecific oats, and were found to mediate active
transport of organic anions from the interstitium to the cells
in the basolateral membrane of the proximal tubule (hosoyamada et al., 1999; cha et al., 2001). some differences in
characteristics exist between  xxxg2113xxx  and  xxxg2115xxx , such as
substrate specificity and localization:  xxxg2113xxx  at the basolateral side of the s2 segment of the proximal tubule (hosoyamada et al., 1999) versus  xxxg2115xxx  at the first, second, and
third segments (s1, s2, and s3) of the proximal tubule (cha et
al., 2001). in addition,  xxxg2113xxx , but not  xxxg2115xxx , exhibits
transport properties as an exchanger (hosoyamada et al.,
1999; cha et al., 2001). on the other hand,  xxxg2109xxx  is localized to the apical membrane of the proximal tubule (babu et
al., 2002), and  xxxg2109xxx  exhibits a relatively narrow substrate
specificity compared with  xxxg2113xxx  and  xxxg2115xxx  (cha et al.,
2000).
carrier-mediated transport of methotrexate in the basolat-

eral side of the proximal tubule was suggested based on the
results of the experiments using renal slices (nierenberg,
1983; williams et al., 1984) or isolated proximal tubule (besseghir et al., 1989). the current results suggest that  xxxg2115xxx 
and  xxxg2113xxx  mediate the transport of methotrexate in the
basolateral side of the proximal tubule. human oat cloned
by lu was designated as human kidney p-aminohippurate
transporter ( xxxg2113xxx ) (lu et al., 1999), and there was 98.2%
amino acid sequence homology between  xxxg2113xxx  and  xxxg2113xxx 
(data not shown). in contrast to  xxxg2113xxx ,  xxxg2113xxx  exhibited no
significant methotrexate uptake activity. the discrepancy in
methotrexate uptake activity between  xxxg2113xxx  and  xxxg2113xxx 
may be due to this small difference in amino acid sequence or
the experimental conditions. to clarify this, a site-directed
mutagenesis study should be performed. the current results
were also consistent with the previous results that rat oat1
mediates methotrexate uptake (uwai et al., 2000). in addition,  xxxg2114xxx , which was recently identified to be localized to
the basolateral side of the proximal tubule, showed no significant uptake activity of methotrexate (m. takeda, unpublished observation). this is in contrast to the recent report
that cells expressing  xxxg2114xxx  showed uptake of methotrexate
(sun et al., 2001). the reason for the discrepancy remains
unknown, and further studies should be performed. it is also
possible that unidentified oats other than  xxxg2115xxx  and
 xxxg2113xxx  are also involved in methotrexate transport in the
basolateral membrane of the proximal tubule.
in addition to  xxxg2109xxx , human transporters mediating the
transport of organic anions in the apical membrane of the
proximal tubule have been cloned, including  xxxg15xxx  (leier et
al., 2000) and npt1 (uchino et al., 2000). moreover, human
 xxxg15xxx  was shown to mediate the efflux of methotrexate using
stable cells (hooijberg et al., 1999). thus, the relative contribution of  xxxg2109xxx  and  xxxg15xxx  to apical methotrexate transport
should be clarified. in addition to human transporters, rodent transporters mediating the apical transport of organic
anions have been cloned, including oat-k1 (saito et al.,
1996; masuda et al., 1999b), oat-k2 (masuda et al., 1999a),
 xxxg2163xxx  (jacquemin et al., 1994), and oatp3 (abe et al., 1998).
among them, oat-k1 and oat-k2 were reported to mediate
bidirectional methotrexate transport (saito et al., 1996; masuda et al., 1999a,b), and the km value for oat-k1-mediated
methotrexate transport was determined to be 1.0 ␮m (masuda et al., 1997). thus, the cloning of human homologs of
these rodent transporters and the functional analysis for the
role of these transporters in apical methotrexate transport
should be performed
since various drugs tested in this study dose dependently
inhibited  xxxg2113xxx -,  xxxg2115xxx -, and  xxxg2109xxx -mediated methotrexate uptake, it was suggested that  xxxg2113xxx ,  xxxg2115xxx , and
 xxxg2109xxx  are sites of drug interactions between methotrexate
and these drugs. among these interactions, it appears that
those between methotrexate and salicylate, phenylbutazone,
indomethacin, or probenecid at  xxxg2115xxx  may have clinical
significance, as follows. the total and unbound plasma concentrations of various drugs are as listed in the table 2.
therapeutically relevant concentrations of unbound drugs in
the plasma are thought to be within 5-fold of the maximum
steady-state concentrations of unbound drugs in the plasma
(zhang et al., 2000). comparing the ki values with therapeutically relevant concentrations of unbound drugs in the
plasma, those for salicylate, phenylbutazone, indomethacin,

and probenecid were comparable. in addition, the ki values
obtained in the presence of 5% human  xxxg124xxx  were
comparable with total plasma concentrations of salicylate,
phenylbutazone, indomethacin, or probenecid. based on
these, it was predicted that these drugs could inhibit the
 xxxg2115xxx -mediated methotrexate uptake in vivo, leading to the
increased plasma concentration of methotrexate.
uwai et al. (2000) have already demonstrated that the ic50
values of salicylate,  xxxd2423xxx , and indomethacin for rat
oat1-mediated methotrexate uptake were 1410, 0.5, and 2.7
␮m, respectively. however, we found that the ic50 values of
salicylate,  xxxd2423xxx , and indomethacin for  xxxg2113xxx -mediated methotrexate uptake were ⬎2000, 1200, and ⬎2000 ␮m,
respectively (data not shown). this discrepancy in findings
may be due to the species difference, i.e., between rats and
humans. compared with rat oat1, the amino acid sequence
of  xxxg2113xxx  exhibited 86.0% homology (sekine et al., 1997). on
the other hand, the ic50 values of ibuprofen,  xxxd2423xxx ,
 xxxd2969xxx , indomethacin, and probenecid for adefovir uptake
in chinese hamster ovary cells stably expressing  xxxg2113xxx 
were 8.0, 1.3, 20.5, 3.0, and 7.4 ␮m, respectively (mulato et
al., 2000). the results were similar to those for rat oat1mediated methotrexate uptake (uwai et al., 2000), but much
lower than those for  xxxg2113xxx -mediated methotrexate uptake.
the discrepancy may be due to the fact that the km value for
 xxxg2113xxx -mediated adefovir uptake was 23.8 ␮m (ho et al.,
2000), whereas that for  xxxg2113xxx -mediated methotrexate uptake was 553.8 ␮m.
at present, the mechanism for the interaction between
methotrexate and ibuprofen,  xxxd2423xxx , or  xxxd2969xxx , or
 xxxd2871xxx  remains unclear. it is possible that other transporters mediate methotrexate transport and are responsible
for drug interactions. since protein-binding displacement of
methotrexate by nsaids except salicylate is generally
thought to account for more than a small transient increase
in free methotrexate concentration, protein binding changes
would probably not be of major clinical significance (taylor
and halprin, 1977). in addition, since prostaglandin synthesis is stimulated to maintain the glomerular filtration rate in
the setting of prerenal volume contraction (ciabattoni et al.,
1984; dunn, 1984), nsaids may decrease glomerular filtration of methotrexate as a result of inhibition of prostaglandin
synthesis (kremer and hamilton, 1995). however, patients
who do not have a condition that predisposes them to activation of renal prostaglandins would not have a decrease in

renal function following treatment with nsaids (kremer
and hamilton, 1995).
in conclusion, these results suggest that methotrexate is
taken up in the basolateral membrane by  xxxg2115xxx  and
 xxxg2113xxx , and taken up or effluxed in the apical membrane of
the proximal tubule via  xxxg2109xxx . in addition,  xxxg2113xxx ,  xxxg2115xxx ,
and  xxxg2109xxx  were sites of drug interactions between methotrexate and nsaids, probenecid, and  xxxd2871xxx . furthermore, it was predicted that  xxxg2115xxx  is a site of drug interactions between methotrexate and salicylate, phenylbutazone,
indomethacin, or probenecid in vivo. stable cells established
in this study provide a good opportunity for evaluating drug
interaction of methotrexate and newly developed drugs, particularly nsaids, in the preclinical stage.
