the study examined the effects of the benzodiazepine receptor partial agonist, ro 19-8022, on anxiety-like, aggressive,
social and locomotor behaviours in timid (‘anxious’) and aggressive mice in the social conflict test. to test the hypothesis
that ro 19-8022 acts as a partial agonist in this model, i.e. it reduces anxiety-like and aggressive behaviours without
affecting motor coordination, its effects were compared to those of the full agonist, nitrazepam. both ro 19-8022 and
nitrazepam decreased anxiety-like behaviour in timid mice and aggressive behaviour in aggressive mice. the effect of the
full agonist, nitrazepam, was dose-dependent while the effect of the partial agonist, ro 19-8022, was lower in magnitude
and reflected its partial agonistic properties. both drugs stimulated social behaviour in both groups of mice, presumably
due to disinhibition of anxiety or aggression. the marked difference was in their effects on motor coordination, as
nitrazepam, but not ro 19-8022, produced motor impairment at higher doses. thus, ro 19-8022 produces anxiolytic-like
and potent anti-aggressive effects without causing muscle relaxation or ataxia in the present model. our data confirm
that the main behavioural differences between partial and full benzodiazepine receptor agonists are in their side-effect
profiles. 䊚 2000 lippincott williams & wilkins.

introduction
a large number of ligands bind to the central benzodiazepine binding site žbenzodiazepine receptor,
bzr., an allosteric modulatory site present at the
gaba a receptor complex žhaefely, 1987; barnard
et al., 1998.. benzodiazepine receptor žbzr. agonists, which enhance gaba a receptor function,
differ in their intrinsic efficacy and fractional occupancy žhaefely et al., 1990.. traditional benzodiazepines žbzs., such as diazepam or nitrazepam,
act as full agonists, as they have high positive efficacy and elicit maximal effects at low to intermediate fractional bzr occupancy žfacklam et al.,
1992b.. in ¨ i¨ o, high positive efficacy of full agonists
results in anxiolytic and anticonvulsant therapeutic
effects, as well as in side-effects, such as sedation,
muscle relaxation, and development of tolerance
and dependence žnutt, 1986; haefely, 1988.. on the
other hand, partial agonists have lower intrinsic efficacy, and thus require higher bzr occupancy than
full agonists to produce the equivalent effect
žhaefely et al., 1990; facklam et al., 1992b..
0955-8810 䊚 2000 lippincott williams & wilkins

it is believed that anxiolytic and anticonvulsant
effects occur at lower receptor occupancy than that
necessary to produce sedative and muscle relaxant
effects žhaefely et al., 1990.. thus, lower intrinsic
efficacy of partial agonists could be related to a
lower incidence of unwanted side-effects, with maintained therapeutic anxiolytic and anticonvulsant
properties žhaefely et al., 1990, 1992.. in other words,
partial bzr agonists produce some effects comparable to those of full agonists, such as anxiolytic or
anticonvulsant effects, but fail to produce other effects, such as motor impairment, which are typical of
full agonists žhaefely et al., 1990; facklam et al.,
1992a; jenck et al., 1992.. partial bzr agonists,
therefore, have been studied intensively as potential
‘non-sedative’ anxiolytic and anticonvulsant drugs
žhaefely et al., 1990, 1992; nutt, 1993; kunovac and
stahl, 1995..
ro 19-8022 is a bzr partial agonist that requires
95% receptor occupancy to produce an effect equivalent to that of diazepam at 35% receptor occupancy žfacklam et al., 1992b.. in ¨ i¨ o, ro 19-8022

shows anxiolytic and anticonvulsant effects comparable to those of full agonists žfacklam et al., 1992a;
jenck et al., 1992; sanger, 1995; griebel et al.,
1996a, b; nazar et al., 1997. but fails to produce
motor impairment up to very high doses, as assessed
in the horizontal wire test, the rotarod performance
test and in the actimeter žfacklam et al., 1992a;
jenck et al., 1992; griebel et al., 1996a, b.. the
anxiolytic effect of ro 19-8022 was found in several
exploration-based animal models of anxiety žlister,
1990., such as the elevated plus-maze žgriebel et al.,
1996a., the lightrdark transition and the freeexploration test žgriebel et al., 1996b., as well as in
conflict procedures žfacklam et al., 1992a; jenck et
al., 1992; sanger, 1995; nazar et al., 1997.. however,
there are no data on the effects of ro 19-8022 in
animal models of anxiety based on social behaviour,
such as the social conflict test in mice žkrsiak, 1975,
1979. or the social interaction test in rats žfile,
1980..
this study examined the effects of the bzr partial agonist, ro 19-8022, on a variety of behaviours
occurring during social conflict in mice. this ethologically based laboratory model provides a wide
repertoire of behavioural measures that enable us to
record the effects of drugs on anxiety-like, aggressive and social behaviour, as well as the degree of
motor impairment and sedation in the same animal
žmiczek and krsiak, 1979; krsiak et al., 1984.. moreover, it allows us to compare behavioural effects of
drugs in two populations of mice: predominantly
timid ž‘anxious’. and predominantly aggressive
žkrsiak, 1975, 1979..
to test the hypothesis that ro 19-8022 produces
the behavioural profile of a partial agonist in the
social conflict test ži.e. that it reduces anxiety-like
behaviours without affecting motor coordination.,
the effects of ro 19-8022 were compared to those of
the full agonist, nitrazepam. we expected that the
effect of ro 19-8022 on anxiety, due to its partial
agonism, would be smaller in magnitude and that it
would not totally suppress anxiety-like behaviour
even at a very high dose. our second goal was to
examine the effects of ro 19-8022 on aggression in
both timid and aggressive mice, as this had not
previously been studied. since full bzr agonists,
due to modulation of factors inhibitory to aggression
žolivier et al., 1991., produce taming effects at intermediate and high doses žskolnick et al., 1985. but
increase aggression at low doses žolivier et al., 1991;
miczek et al., 1994., we hypothesized that the effects
of ro 19-8022 would resemble those of nitrazepam.
moreover, the effects of the full and partial agonists
were compared in timid ž‘anxious’. and aggressive

mice, in order to assess whether reactivity to drug
treatment between these groups differs only in magnitude.
methods
subjects

male albino mice, derived from the icr strain
žpurchased from velaz, prague, czech republic.
were used in this study. they weighed 18᎐20 g at the
beginning of the experiment. half of the mice served
as subjects and were housed individually in selfcleaning cages žthe ‘isolates’. for a period of
3 weeks. the cages for individual housing ž8 = 17 =
13 cm. were made of solid metal walls 13 cm high
and wire-mesh floors ž8 = 17 cm., and were placed
3 cm above trays with wood shavings. the singly
housed mice were not handled throughout the isolation period. the rest of the mice served as partners
and were housed in groups of 10 ž‘grouped-housed’.
in standard plastic cages ž26 = 42 = 15 cm. with
floors covered with wood shavings. all mice were
housed in a vivarium with a 12 hour light᎐dark cycle
žlights on from 06.00 to 18.00 hours. with the room
temperature ranging from 22 to 24⬚c. standard
laboratory food and water were available ad libitum.
procedure

the behaviour of the mice was recorded in a room
with moderate artificial illumination, using a panasonic video camera. social interactions occurred in
transparent plexiglas cages ž20 = 30 = 20 cm. containing wood shavings and covered with a transparent plexiglas top with air holes. all interactions were
recorded during the light phase of the light᎐dark
cycle žfrom 08.00 to 13.00 hours..
social interaction tests started after 3 weeks of
isolation and always involved one singly housed
mouse paired with the same group-housed mouse.
the isolates were allowed a 30-min adaptation to
the observation cages before the group-housed partners were introduced. this procedure suppresses
aggression in group-housed mice and facilitates active social behaviour in isolates. interactions lasted
for 4 min. after each interaction, cages were cleaned
and the floors were covered with new wood shavings.
all subjects underwent four social interaction tests
at 1-week intervals. the isolates were given drugs or
vehicle in a randomized order, according to a latin
square design žeach mouse served as its own control..
the group-housed mice served only to stimulate
social behaviour in the isolates and were always
untreated. in the case that a group-housed ‘stimulus’
mouse attacked the isolated mouse žsubject., the
pair was excluded from the experiment.

bz partial agonist and social conflict

behavioural measures

two independent observers, who were blind to the
treatment conditions, subsequently scored videotapes. the observers scored the behaviour of the
isolates žsingly housed mice. using the ‘activities’
program for ethological observations ždonat,
´ 1991..
the first observer scored the following behavioural acts and postures, as defined by krsiak ž1975,
1979. and similar to those described by grant and
mackintosh ž1963.. acts and postures were divided
into four main categories: ž1. timid activities, including escapes, defensive and alert postures; ž2. aggressive activities, including attacks, threats and tail
rattles; ž3. social activities, including social sniff,
partner follow and climb over the partner; and ž4.
locomotion, including walking, rearing, approach to
the partner and leave of the partner. self-grooming
was also scored. for each behavioural item, the
program ‘activities’ automatically measured frequency, duration žtotal time spent exhibiting the
behaviour over a 4-min testing period. and latency
to the first occurrence.
the second observer scored signs of motor impairment in the isolates during every social interaction.
signs of motor impairment included ataxia žstaggering and falling while rearing. and muscle relaxation
žcrawling walk.. the observer recorded whether
these signs were present or absent.
drugs

nitrazepam and ro 19-8022 žf. hoffmann la roche,
basel, switzerland. were dissolved in distilled water
with 2 drops of tween 80. drugs were administered
orally 30 min before each social interaction in a
volume 0.1 mlrkg. in experiment 1, nitrazepam ž0,
0.1, 1 and 10 mgrkg. was tested on 50 subjects
versus 50 partners. in experiment 2 the same numbers of animals were used to test ro 19-8022 ž0, 1,
10 and 100 mgrkg..
data analysis

subjects were first classified into three groups according to their behaviour in the interaction when
they received the vehicle: aggressive mice were those
that exhibited attacks, timid mice were those that
showed defensive postures or escapes but no attacks,
and sociable mice included those that showed no
attacks or defensive᎐escape behaviour.
in experiment 1 žnitrazepam., 15 subjects were
classified as aggressive, 25 as timid and 4 mice as
sociable. six subjects were excluded from the experiment because their partners attacked them. in ex-

periment 2, there were 17 aggressive, 18 timid and 9
sociable mice. six subjects were excluded after being
attacked by their partners. because of the small
number of sociable mice, their data were not evaluated statistically.
the effects of each drug on behavioural items that
showed homogeneity of variance were analysed
using repeated-measures one-way anova. nonhomogeneous data were transformed using square
root transformation before analysis. data that did
not meet the criteria for parametric statistics were
analysed using a repeated-measures anova on
ranks žfriedman.. post-hoc comparisons between
vehicle- and drug-treated groups were carried out
using parametric or non-parametric versions of dunnett’s test žglantz, 1992.. dose᎐response curves for
nitrazepam and ro 19-8022 were compared using
two-way repeated-measure anova. measures of
motor impairment were analysed using mcnemar’s
test.

discussion
the present study demonstrated that both the partial bzr agonist, ro 19-8022, and the full agonist,
nitrazepam, elicit an anxiolytic-like effect in timid
ž‘anxious’. mice. however, their effects differed
somewhat, mainly in magnitude. nitrazepam decreased anxiety-like behaviour in a dose-dependent
manner, with almost total suppression at the highest
dose. on the other hand, ro 19-8022 produced
rather shallow dose᎐response curves of anxiety-like

bz partial agonist and social conflict

behaviours that resembled those described in ¨ itro
žfacklam et al., 1992b; mehta and shank, 1995;
johnston and bristow, 1998.. our data also show
that the partial bzr agonist ro 19-8022 possesses
potent anti-aggressive properties that are comparable to those of the full agonist nitrazepam. the full
and the partial agonists differed in their side-effect
profiles, as nitrazepam, but not ro 19-8022, produced motor impairment at the highest dose.
our finding that the partial agonist, ro 19-8022,
shows an anxiolytic-like profile in the social conflict
procedure is generally consistent with previous reports using other models of anxiety. an anxiolytic
effect of ro 19-8022 was reported in the elevated
plus-maze žgriebel et al., 1996a. and in the
lightrdark transition test žgriebel et al., 1996b.,
animal models of anxiety based on exploration
žlister, 1990.. in contrast, 10 mgrkg of ro 19-8022
failed to produce an anxiolytic effect in the open-field
test žnazar et al., 1997., another model of anxiety
based on exploration. however, this dose was found
to be the lowest effective dose in the abovementioned models of anxiety based on exploration,
such as the elevated plus-maze and the lightrdark
transition test žgriebel et al., 1996a, b.. therefore, it
is likely that a higher dose than 10 mgrkg of ro
19-8022 is necessary to obtain a significant anxiolytic
effect in the open field. ro 19-8022 also produced
anti-conflict activity in several operant models of
anxiety based on punishment žfacklam et al., 1992a;
jenck et al., 1992; sanger, 1995; nazar et al., 1997..
our findings that ro 19-8022 is anxiolytic in the
social conflict test in mice, an animal model of
anxiety based on social behaviour, thus complete the
behavioural profile of this bzr partial agonist.
the bzr partial agonist ro 19-8022 produced a
clear anti-aggressive effect. full bzr agonists are
known to reduce aggressive behaviour at intermediate to high doses žmiczek and krsiak, 1979; skolnick
et al., 1985; krsiak and sulcova, 1990. and the taming
properties of the first benzodiazepine, chlordiazepoxide žrandall et al., 1960., contributed to the
discovery of the anxiolytic properties of benzodiazepines. on the other hand, reports on the effects
of bzr partial agonists on aggression are virtually
lacking. in our study, intermediate and high doses of
ro 19-8022 significantly reduced aggressive behaviour in aggressive mice, and the effects on aggression were similar to those produced by the full
bzr agonist, nitrazepam.
on the other hand, low doses of benzodiazepines
have been reported to increase aggressive behaviour
in both animals and humans žreviewed by miczek et
al., 1994.. we found increased aggression in timid

mice at the lowest dose of ro 19-8022, and a trend
toward increased aggression at low doses of
nitrazepam. the data thus support the hypothesis
that aggression-enhancing effects of low doses of
benzodiazepines can be observed in some, but not
all, animals žmiczek et al., 1993.. however, increased aggression was not observed in aggressive
mice. as noted by olivier et al. ž1991., ‘aggressionenhancing effects are particularly marked when aggression is inhibited by external or internal events’.
this, in the model of social conflict, applies to timid
but not aggressive mice, and explains why increased
aggression was observed only in timid mice. it might
be also possible that aggression was not increased in
aggressive mice due to a ceiling effect.
in the model of social conflict in mice, drugs with
anxiolytic properties not only decrease defensive᎐
escape behaviour but also increase, presumably due
to disinhibition, social investigation žkrsiak et al.,
1984; krsiak and sulcova, 1990.. the disinhibition of
social behaviour was suggested to be a good predictor of anxiolytic activity of drugs in the present
model žkrsiak et al., 1984. as well as in the social
interaction test in rats žfile and hyde, 1978; file,
1980.. in timid mice, ro 19-8022 and nitrazepam not
only decreased anxiety-like behaviour but also stimulated social behaviour, suggesting that they possess anxiolytic properties. ro 19-8022 and nitrazepam also increased social behaviour in aggressive mice. the increase of social behaviour was
similar in both aggressive and timid mice, as it
reached about five times the control value at the
highest dose of each drug.
both ro 19-8022 and nitrazepam increased walking in timid mice but decreased it in aggressive mice.
however, time spent walking was low in vehicletreated timid mice but high in vehicle-treated aggressive animals žsee figure 4.. it is known that
locomotion is inhibited in timid mice žkrsiak, 1975.
and anxiolytic drugs, therefore, increase locomotion
due to disinhibition. on the other hand, aggression
is associated with excitation reflected as a high incidence of walking. as ro 19-8022 and nitrazepam
reduced aggressive behaviour, they also reduced
walking associated with it.
the significant difference between the full and the
partial agonists was in the effects on motor coordination. rearing behaviour was decreased and apparent signs of ataxia and muscle relaxation were
observed in nitrazepam-treated mice, suggesting that
nitrazepam attenuated motor coordination. mice
treated with ro 19-8022 showed no signs of motor
impairment, even at a dose 10 times higher than that
with an active anxiolytic effect. the finding that ro

19-8022 does not produce motor impairment is consistent with the results of other investigators using
tests such as the horizontal wire test, the rotarod
performance test and the actimeter žfacklam et al.,
1992a; jenck et al., 1992; griebel et al., 1996a, b..
moreover, ro 19-8022 has been reported to antagonize the muscle relaxant and sedative effects of full
agonists such as diazepam žfacklam et al., 1992a;
jenck et al., 1992..
the results of the present study indicate that, in
social conflict in mice, the partial agonist ro 19-8022
differs from the full agonist nitrazepam mainly in its
effect on motor coordination. the effects of ro
19-8022 on some components of motor behaviour
were opposite to those of the full agonist, as ro
19-8022 did not produce motor impairment. in contrast, the partial agonist showed anxiolytic and antiaggressive effects comparable to those of the full
agonist, although its effects were somewhat smaller
in magnitude. this confirms the hypothesis that
neurobehavioural differences between full and partial bzr agonists might be linked to different receptor occupancy and intrinsic activity žhaefely et al.,
1990; facklam et al., 1992a., as some effects, such as
those on motor coordination, require higher receptor occupancy. however, the present results also
evoke the question, whether the differences in their
effects reflect targeting of different subsets of
benzodiazepine receptors. there is no evidence in
the literature of binding of these two ligands to
different subsets of bzr and a study exploring this
possibility would be interesting. in general, there
was no difference in reactivity to pharmacological
treatment between timid and aggressive mice. this
would suggest that behaviour of timid and aggressive
mice in interaction with non-aggressive partners is
probably not caused by different densities of central
benzodiazepine receptors.
