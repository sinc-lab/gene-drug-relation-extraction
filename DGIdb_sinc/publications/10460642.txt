background: abdominal aortic aneurysms are characterized by degradation of the extracellular matrix,

with a reduction in the elastin concentration of the arterial media. these changes have been linked to
increased levels of endogenous metalloproteinases (mmps) within the aorta, particularly  xxxg1428xxx  and
 xxxg1440xxx . this provides a potential therapeutic target for pharmacological agents aimed at reducing the
growth rate of small aneurysms. in this study, the ability of marimastat (an mmp inhibitor) to reduce
matrix degradation was assessed in a previously described model of aneurysm disease.
methods: porcine aortic segments (n = 12) were preincubated in exogenous pancreatic elastase for 24 h
before culture in standard conditions for 13 days with marimastat 10±5, 10±6 and 10±7 mol/l. control
segments were cultured both without marimastat and without elastase. at the termination of culture,
mmps were extracted from the tissue and quanti®ed by substrate gel enzymography. the volume
fractions of elastin and collagen were determined by stereological analysis of sections stained with
miller's elastin and van gieson's stain.
results: stereological analysis demonstrated preservation of elastin in aorta treated with marimastat at
10±6 and 10±5 mol/l; this was signi®cant at the latter concentration (p = 0´007). this was accompanied by
a signi®cant reduction in active  xxxg1428xxx  activity in the samples treated with marimastat 10±5 mol/l
(p < 0´01).
conclusion: marimastat signi®cantly inhibited elastin degradation and active  xxxg1428xxx  production
within aortic organ cultures.

introduction

since 1950 there has been a progressive increase in the
number of deaths from aortic aneurysm in both men and
women. this trend has been observed in a number of
centres worldwide1±4, and has been con®rmed by necropsy
studies5, routine mortality statistics6, hospital inpatient
statistics7 and screening programmes8.
although most abdominal aortic aneurysms (aaas) are
asymptomatic, 25 per cent of aneurysms rupture per year9,
of which 10 per cent are less than 5 cm in diameter10. many
patients do not survive to reach hospital and, in those that
do, the operative mortality rate for ruptured aaa is very
high, ranging between 21 per cent11 and 70 per cent12.
one of the most consistent histological ®ndings in aaa
disease is the breakdown of elastin and matrix components
of the aortic wall. experimental models have shown that
elastin is essential for the elastic recoil of the aortic wall and
that loss of elastin may predispose to aaa development if

collagen in the tunica media fails to contain the stress
imposed13. matrix metalloproteinases (mmps) are a family
of zinc-dependent enzymes that are present in normal
healthy individuals where they participate in cell turnover
and growth. they are tightly regulated by naturally
occurring tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases
(timps)14. the mmps have the capacity to degrade elastin
and other matrix components, and the gelatinases  xxxg1428xxx 
and  xxxg1440xxx  have been implicated in the aetiology of
aneurysm disease15. it has been hypothesized that an
imbalance of mmps and timps in the aortic wall, possibly
mediated by in¯ammatory cytokines released at the site of
vessel injury, may predispose to aneurysmal degeneration.
based on the recognition that accelerated and possibly
unregulated degradation of matrix proteins is a prominent
feature of aaa, a potential strategy to limit progressive
aneurysm growth might include direct inhibition of these
proteinases. the development of mmp inhibitors for the
control of malignant disease has aroused interest in the role

of pharmacological agents in the treatment of aaa. it is
conceivable that mmp inhibition may preserve existing
connective tissue proteins, and allow tissue repair processes
to stabilize and strengthen the aortic wall, thus allowing
surgical aaa repair to be delayed or avoided.
marimastat (british biotech pharmaceuticals, oxford,
uk) is a synthetic molecule that is designed to mimic the
substrate of mmps. one substituent of the marimastat
molecule is a hydroxamate group, which combines with the
zinc atom at the active site of mmps. this, together with
stereochemical aspects in the marimastat molecule that
mimic the natural substrate, leads to inhibition of these
enzymes.
in this study, a previously described organ culture model
of aneurysm disease16 was used to investigate the effects of
marimastat at various concentrations.
materials and methods

organ culture
porcine thoracic aortas were provided by the university of
nottingham. aortas were retrieved fresh and transported in
minimal essential medium on ice. under sterile conditions,
fat and loose adventitial tissues were removed. segments of
aorta (1 cm2) were excised and pinned, intimal surface
uppermost, on to a polyester gauze support resting on
sylgard resin (dow corning, seneffe, belgium), in the base
of a 6-cm petri dish (fisons, loughborough, uk). samples
were denuded of endothelium and cultured for 14 days in
standard medium (7 ml) containing 5 per cent fetal calf
serum (sera lab, crawley, uk), which was changed after
24 h and then every 48 h16,17.
experimental design
five porcine aortic segments were preincubated in culture
medium supplemented with porcine pancreatic elastase 100
units/ml (calbiochem, nottingham, uk) for 24 h. exposure to a brief pulse of elastase has been shown previously to
induce mmp production and time-dependent elastin
degradation in aortic tissue samples, providing an in vitro
model of aneurysm disease18.
after this, one sample was harvested for control purposes
(control 1) and the four remaining aortic sections were
washed thoroughly to remove all traces of exogenous
elastase. the aortic sections were then cultured for a further
13 days in standard culture medium (elastase) or culture
medium supplemented by subtherapeutic, therapeutic and
supratherapeutic concentrations of marimastat (10±7, 10±6
and 10±5 mol/l respectively). one aortic sample was
cultured for 14 days without exposure to elastase (control
british journal of surgery 1999, 86, 1053±1058

2). the experiment was replicated in 12 separate aortas. at
the termination of organ culture the tissue was divided into
two equal segments which were prepared for histological
evaluation and metalloproteinase quanti®cation.
histology
following ®xation in formalin, samples were dehydrated in
99 per cent industrial  xxxd102xxx  (sigma, poole, uk),
transferred into xylene (sigma) for 4 h and embedded in
paraf®n wax. sections (4 mm) were stained with both
haematoxylin and eosin, and miller's elastin and van
gieson's stain (evg).
stereological tissue analysis
the volume fractions of elastin, collagen and smooth
muscle cells in the extracellular matrix were determined by
stereological analysis as described previously16. aortic
sections, stained with evg, were viewed at 3 400
magni®cation using an olympus (hamburg, germany)
microscope incorporating an eyepiece graticule with a 100point test grid (graticules, kent, uk). one hundred test
points were then analysed, with test points hitting black
indicating elastin, those hitting yellow indicating smooth
muscle cells and points hitting pink indicating collagen.
following analysis, the relative volume fraction of each
component was calculated. to maintain a constant frame of
reference throughout all experiments, the adventitial aspect
of the media was point counted, with eight randomly chosen
®elds quanti®ed for each sample. stereological tissue
analysis re¯ects the ability of the tissue to take up
histological stain, and thus measures of collagen, elastin
and smooth muscle cells re¯ect changes in the relative
concentrations of each of these elements, rather than
changes in protein content.
previous experiments have determined the interobserver
limits of agreement for this technique in the authors'
institution16.
gel enzymography
metalloproteinases were extracted from frozen tissue using
the method of vine and powell19 as described previously16.
tissue was thawed over ice, diced into 1 mm3 pieces and
homogenized in buffer. the homogenate was centrifuged
and dialysed, and the protein concentration was standardized for each sample to 0´9 mg/ml with phosphate-buffered
saline.
substrate gels were prepared by incorporating gelatin
1 mg/ml (sigma) into a 10 per cent sodium dodecyl
sulphate±polyacrylamide gel. some 15 ml standardized

2´5 per cent triton x-100 (sigma), incubated in buffer

the molecular weight of each band was estimated by
comparison with the positions of known molecular

the relative density of each lytic band was determined
from negative photographic images of gels with an image-

master scanning densitometer (pharmacia lkb, st albans,

area of the band. the protein concentration used in this
analysis had been previously determined to be within the
linear range for densitometric quanti®cation (data not
shown).

stereological analysis
fig. 1 shows representative histological sections of aorta
cultured with and without marimastat. there was no
reduction in the elastin concentration in the sections of
aorta cultured under standard conditions for 14 days.
exposure to a 24-h pulse of elastase 100 units/ml induced
matrix degradation in a time-dependent manner as
described previously16 resulting in signi®cant elastin
depletion at 14 days.

stereological analysis demonstrated signi®cant preservation of elastin in the elastase-exposed aortic sections
cultured in standard medium supplemented with marimastat 10±5 mol/l compared with sections not treated with
marimastat (p = 0´007). there also appeared to be a trend
towards elastin preservation in the sections treated with
marimastat 10±6 and 10±7 mol/l, although this was not
signi®cant (p = 0´013 and p = 0´116 respectively). the
median percentage elastin concentration for all aortic
segments is illustrated in fig. 2.
gelatinolytic activity
gelatin enzymography con®rmed a time-dependent increase in mmp activity within elastase-treated cultures
compared with that in control samples. fresh aortic tissue
demonstrated lytic bands at 70 kda, whilst elastase-treated
samples demonstrated a progressive increase in gelatinolytic activity at 70 kda (doublet) and at 90 kda.
a representative gelatin zymogram of homogenates for
grouped control and marimastat-treated aortas is depicted
in fig. 3. densitometric analysis of the aortic segments

with those cultured in standard medium after elastase
exposure (p < 0´01) (fig. 4). there were no signi®cant
differences in active  xxxg1428xxx  activity at the lower concentrations of marimastat, and no changes were observed in
pro- xxxg1428xxx  or  xxxg1440xxx  activity in the marimastat-treated

discussion

it has been found consistently in experimental models of
aneurysm disease that elastase-induced destruction of the
aortic wall matrix and medial elastin causes progressive
aneurysmal degeneration, analogous to the natural history
of human aneurysm disease21,22. as in human disease, the
increased local production of mmps may be an important
contributor to experimental aneurysm development21.
recently plasma  xxxg1440xxx  levels have been found to be
signi®cantly higher in patients with aaa than in healthy
volunteers23.
pharmacological manipulation may provide a possible
therapeutic strategy in the treatment of small (4´0±5´5 cm)
aortic aneurysms, of which a signi®cant proportion
progressively increase in size and eventually rupture24.
propranolol reduced the size of experimental aaas in a
hypertensive rat model25 and also reduced the rate of
expansion of large (5 cm or more) aneurysms26. however,
there is as yet no evidence that propranolol or other
antihypertensive drugs reduce the rate of expansion of small
aneurysms. a variety of mmp inhibitors has been used in
models of aneurysm disease. indomethacin was reported to
inhibit aneurysm growth in a rat model, and this correlated
with a reduction in macrophage expression of  xxxg1440xxx 
within the aortic wall27. tetracyclines inhibit mmps and,
again in a rat model, petrinec et al.22 found that doxycycline
inhibited the development of experimental aaa which also
correlated with suppression of  xxxg1440xxx  production in the
aortic wall. local overexpression of timp-1 prevents aortic
aneurysm degeneration28, and this further strengthens the
theory that mmp overproduction is responsible for
aneurysm degeneration and rupture. timps are probably
unsuitable as therapeutic agents because of their short halflife in vivo, but the synthetic anticancer agents  xxxd287xxx 
and marimastat both inhibit a variety of mmps, particularly
 xxxg1428xxx  and mmp-929.  xxxd287xxx  has recently been shown
to limit the expansion of aaas in a rat model30. this was
associated with signi®cant preservation of elastin and
control of the in¯ammatory response. marimastat is,
however, the more therapeutically appealing compound
as, unlike  xxxd287xxx , it has good oral absorption properties.
it has recently entered clinical trials for patients with
metastatic disease31.
ã 1999 blackwell science ltd

in this study therapeutic concentrations of marimastat
appeared to have reduced signi®cantly the experimentally
induced elastolysis that occurs in the aortic wall. as
expected for an agent that acts by competitive inhibition
at the active-site zinc essential for enzyme activity, gel
enzymography revealed that expression of mmps did not
change at subtherapeutic and therapeutic concentrations of
marimastat. there was, however, a signi®cant reduction in
active  xxxg1428xxx  at the 10±5 mol/l (supratherapeutic) concentration. this may be due to the toxic effects of
marimastat on mmp-producing cells. the end effect was
apparent histologically, with clear preservation of medial
elastin.
the uk small aneurysm trial participants have recently
reported that asymptomatic aaas of diameter 4´0±5´5 cm
should undergo surveillance rather than operative repair32.
however, in patients randomized to surveillance, the rapid
expansion of the aneurysm or expansion to more than
5´5 cm led to elective surgery being performed in 39 per cent
of patients by the end of the 4-year trial. at the end of the
trial, aneurysm repair had been performed in 61 per cent of
patients randomized to surveillance. thus there is a clear
need for an effective therapeutic strategy to halt or slow
down aneurysm growth. pharmacological manipulation of
the aneurysmal process by marimastat or other related
compounds may in future provide a promising approach.
