a case of therapy-related acute myeloblastic leukemia with t(16;21)(q24;q22) after chemotherapy with dna- xxxg2312xxx  inhibitors, etoposide and...  a 59-year-old female suffering from malignant lymphoma developed therapy-related acute myeloblastic leukemia (t-aml) after chemotherapy consisting of treatment with dna- xxxg2312xxx  inhibitors, etoposide and mitoxantrone, and an  xxxd3249xxx , cyclophosphamide. the cumulative dose of etoposide administration was 5500 mg; 1500 mg given intravenously and 4000 mg orally. one year later, she suddenly developed aml of fab m2. cytogenetic analysis of bone marrow cells revealed deletion of 7q and a rare translocation, t(16;21)(q24;q22). southern blot analysis of bone marrow cells did not detect rearrangement of the  xxxg1996xxx  gene, however, fluorescence in situ hybridization (fish) analysis of bone marrow cells at interphase and metaphase revealed a translocational splitting between chromosome 21 involving  xxxg1996xxx  gene and chromosome 16. these results suggest that the breakpoint is not located in the  xxxg256xxx  for t(8;21). the patient was treated with chemotherapy and entered complete remission.
