the in vitro pharmacological profile of  xxxd3039xxx , a novel enterokinetic compound.   xxxd3039xxx  is a novel enterokinetic compound and is the first representative of the benzofuran class. we set out to establish its pharmacological profile in various receptor binding and organ bath experiments. receptor binding data have demonstrated  xxxd3039xxx 's high affinity to both investigated 5-ht(4) receptor isoforms, with mean pk(i) estimates of 8.60 and 8.10 for the human 5-ht(4a) and 5-ht(4b) receptor, respectively. from the 50 other binding assays investigated in this study only the human d(4) receptor (pk(i) 5.63), the mouse 5-ht(3) receptor (pk(i) 5.41) and the human sigma(1) (pk(i) 5.43) have shown measurable affinity, resulting in at least 290-fold selectivity for the 5-ht(4) receptor. classical organ bath experiments were done using isolated tissues from the rat, guinea-pig and dog gastrointestinal tract, using various protocols.  xxxd3039xxx  was a 5-ht(4) receptor agonist in the guinea-pig colon, as it induced contractions (pec(50)=7.48+/-0.06; insensitive to a 5-ht(2a) or 5-ht(3) receptor antagonist, but inhibited by a 5-ht(4) receptor antagonist) as well as the facilitation of electrical stimulation-induced noncholinergic contractions (blocked by a 5-ht(4) receptor antagonist). furthermore, it caused relaxation of a rat oesophagus preparation (pec(50)=7.81+/-0.17), in a 5-ht(4) receptor antagonist sensitive manner.  xxxd3039xxx  did not cause relevant inhibition of 5-ht(2a), 5-ht(2b), or 5-ht(3), motilin or cholecystokinin (cck(1)) receptor-mediated contractions, nor nicotinic or muscarinic acetylcholine receptor-mediated contractions, up to 10 microm. it is concluded that  xxxd3039xxx  is a potent, selective and specific 5-ht(4) receptor agonist. as it is intended for treatment of intestinal motility disorders, it is important to note that  xxxd3039xxx  is devoid of anti-cholinergic, anticholinesterase or nonspecific inhibitory activity and does not antagonise 5-ht(2a), 5-ht(2b) and 5-ht(3) receptors or motilin or cck(1) receptors.
