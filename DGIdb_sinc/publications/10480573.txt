thiazinotrienomycin b (tt-b), an  xxxd3116xxx  isolated from fermentation broths of
streptomyces sp. mj672-m3, inhibited the growth in vitro of human stomach tumor sc-6
cells over 10 times more strongly than the growth of other human tumor cells, such as
hela (cervix), t24 (bladder) and lx-l(lung). the extent of growth inhibition by tt-b
of sc-6, but not of lx-1 nor t24, was lowered in a competitive manner by raising serum
concentrations in the culture medium. tt-binhibited the cell cycle progression of sc-6
at an early stage of the progression from g0/g1 to s. the inhibition was again competitive
with serum concentrations in the culture medium. no direct inhibition of dnasynthesis
was observed at the concentration range which caused the cell cycle arrest. tt-band

were antagonistic

to each other in

inhibiting the cell cycle progression of sc-6 from g0/g1 to s, suggesting that the two
compounds share the same target, egfr. the kinase activity of egfrwas little inhibited
by tt-b in a cell-free system.

results and discussion
cell growth inhibition in culture media
containing vaious concentrations of serum
whencells were incubated in a mediumcontaining

10% serum, tt-b inhibited the growth of human stomach

it inhibited the growth of humancarcinoma cells ofhela

(sc-6),
16ng/ml (hela),
17ng/ml (t24) and
33ng/ml
(lx-1). the basic idea of our screening for
antitumor compounds is to find candidates
that have
unique mechanisms of action. since many known
antitumor compounds are inhibitors
of dnasynthesis,

a preliminary experiment showed that tt-b did not

inhibit
the incorporation
of [3h]thymidine
into the
acid-insoluble
fraction of sc-6 cells at concentrations
that inhibited
the cell growth (data not shown), we

therefore thought that the high sensitivity

of sc-6 cells

to tt-b should be due to a tt-b-sensitive
process,
somewhat specific to the cells. since signal transduction

pathways for cell growth vary from one cell type to
another, we focused our attention to test the inhibition

of signal transduction.
inhibitors

factor-dependent signal transduction pathways inhibit
the cell growth more strongly in a serum-free medium
than

in a serum-containing

medium9). we therefore

determined the extent of cell growth inhibition by tt-b

found that the extent of growth inhibition by tt-b of
sc-6 cells was lowered by increasing the serum concentrations
in the medium (fig.la).
analyzed by the double reciprocal

the results were
plot in which the

reciprocal of growth velocity (y-axis) was plotted versus

the reciprocal concentrations of serum (x-axis). the
extraporated lines of the absence and the presence of
tt-b met on the y axis (fig. lb), suggesting that tt-b
competed with growth factors in the serum for the signal
transduction pathways. another human stomach carcinomacell line (mkn-28) also showed a similar competitive
relationship
between growth inhibition
by
tt-b and serum concentrations in the culture medium
(data not shown). no such competitive relationship was

observed with lx-1 (lung) and t24 (bladder);
inhibition

growth

of these cells by tt-b became rather stronger

addition of serum to the serum-starved cells, i.e., the cells

during the period from 0 to 4, from 4 to 8, from 8 to16
or from 16 to 20 hour.

presumed that tt-b and anti-egfr antibody should
inhibit

antagonistically
by
competing for the same target. tt-b and anti-egfr
antibody were added to the serum-starved sc-6 cells

and dnasynthesis was measured 20 hours later as
