abstract
aims: the main focus of this study was to gain an overall view of pseudomonas
putida 06909 genes involved in the pseudomonas–phytophthora interaction as a
biological control mechanism, and to understand the roles of these genes.
methods and results: sixteen ps. putida genes with increased expression on
phytophthora mycelial surfaces were identified using in vivo expression technology (ivet) screening. sequence analysis of these phytophthora myceliuminduced (pmi) genes revealed that many of them display similarity to genes
known or predicted to be involved in carbohydrate catabolism, energy metabolism, amino acid/nucleotide metabolism, and membrane transport processes.
disruption of three pmi genes encoding succinate semialdehyde dehydrogenase,
a  xxxd2537xxx  transporter, and  xxxg861xxx 
showed significant phenotypic differences involved in the colonization processes, including motility, biofilm formation on abiotic surfaces, colony morphology, and competitive colonization of fungal mycelia. all three of these pmi
genes were induced by glycogen and other substances, such as organic acids
and amino acids utilized by ps. putida.
conclusions: the ivet screening and mutant characterization can be used to
identify bacterial genes that are induced on the mycelial surface and provide
insight into the possible mechanisms of mycelial colonization by this bacterium.
significance and impact of the study: the ivet screening through a bacterial
genome library might be a huge task. however, because the genes involved in
direct interaction with phytophthora and in bacterial adaptation can be identified, the ivet system will be a valuable tool in studying biocontrol bacteria at
the molecular and ecological levels.

introduction
currently, there is a great interest in the study of colonization mechanisms in bacteria useful in biological control of plant diseases, to develop disease control to a
greater extent (simons et al. 1997; bloemberg and lugtenberg 2001). soil bacteria belonging to the species pseudomonas fluorescens and pseudomonas putida have been
well studied, because they have the potential for agricultural use (o’sullivan and o’gara 1992; lugtenberg and
120

dekkers 1999; haas et al. 2000; walsh et al. 2001). one
of the most attractive characteristics is that they can colonize root surfaces (rhizosphere), where diverse environmental factors and microbial interactions exist (dekkers
et al. 1998; espinosa-urgel et al. 2002). through extensive
studies by various genetic and physiological approaches,
the molecular mechanisms involved in the attachment
and colonization of plant roots by these fluorescent pseudomonads in the rhizosphere are being identified (haas
et al. 2000; walsh et al. 2001). in the rhizosphere, these

biocontrol bacteria compete for nutrients and niches with
endogenous micro-organisms, such as other bacteria and
fungi. therefore, to gain a better understanding of how
biocontrol bacteria function in the rhizosphere, the interactions with other microbes, such as root pathogenic
fungi, should also be taken into account.
in this study, we focused on a bacterial–phytophthora
interaction in an ongoing programme to identify the
factors influencing biological control by ps. putida
06909, a strain that has shown effectiveness in the control of citrus root rot caused by phytophthora (turney
1995; steddom et al. 2002). in the earlier study using
an in vivo expression technology (ivet) strategy based
on pyrb as a selection marker, which is driven by
fusions with active promoters from a random genomic
library, five genes were identified in ps. putida 06909,
which were induced in the presence of phytophthora
parasitica. sequence analysis indicated that three of
these were related to genes with previously described
functions, including a diacylglycerol kinase, an abc
transporter, and an outer membrane porin (lee and
cooksey 2000). recently, using ivet, the identification
of the ps. fluorescens genes, encoding traits such as
two-component sensing systems, sugar transporters and
metabolism, amino acid transporters, stress response, a
type iii secretion system, and a range of novel genes
which are induced in the rhizosphere, provided a view
of bacterial traits for rhizosphere adaptation (rainey
1999). in this study, we identified 16 additional genes
that were expressed at a higher level on phytophthora
mycelial surfaces using ivet screening, and many of
them were predicted to be involved in carbon catabolism, amino acid/nucleotide metabolism and membrane
transport processes. in a follow-up study, phytophthorainduced genes encoding succinate semialdehyde dehydrogenase, a  xxxd2537xxx  transporter, and  xxxg861xxx , were disrupted by
marker exchange mutagenesis, and their mutants were
phenotypically characterized. in addition, the nutritional
factors stimulating the expression of these genes were
studied.
materials and methods

oomycete-induced bacterial genes

(mg) medium (kahane et al. 1978) supplemented with
yeast extract (0æ25 g l)1) (mgy). the following antibiotic
concentrations were used in the mgy medium: tetracycline, 20 lg ml)1; kanamycin, 30 lg ml)1;  xxxd2193xxx ,
15 lg ml)1 and ampicillin, 200 lg ml)1. when it was
necessary for bacterial growth in a rich medium, ps. putida strains were cultured on pseudomonas agar f (paf)
(difco, detroit, mi, usa) under the same conditions.
the growth rates of the ps. putida mutant strains were
tested in m9 minimal medium (sambrook et al. 1989)
supplemented with  xxxd2534xxx  (1 mmol l)1) and glucose
(0æ4%, w/v) as a carbon source. phytophthora parasitica
m191 was usually grown at 28c on v8c agar (miller
1955), and synthetic growth (sg) medium (andrew
1980) was used for preparation of p. parasitica-spent
medium. agar discs (7 mm in diameter) were cut from
the edge of the mycelium and used as inocula for all the
assays on agar plates. in the plasmid pgem-km, a kanamycin gene flanked by asci restriction sites was produced
by polymerase chain reaction (pcr) with vector pgem-t
easy (promega, madison, wi, usa) as a template.
dna techniques
plasmid preparation, restriction endonuclease cleavage,
ligation, electrophoresis, and other recombinant dna
techniques were carried out using standard methods
(ausubel et al. 1987). chromosomal dna of ps. putida
wild-type strain 06909 and its mutants was prepared with
a genomic dna preparation kit (promega). southern
blot analysis was performed using the dig dna labelling
and detection kit (boehringer mannheim, mannheim,
germany), as described in the manufacturer’s instructions. dna sequencing was carried out at the genomic
institute of the university of california, riverside, ca,
usa. the primers used in this study were synthesized
commercially (genosys biotechnologies, inc, the woodlands, tx, usa). sequences were analysed and compared
with the genbank databases by using blast (basic local
alignment search tool) programs. sequence data for the
ps. putida kt2440 and pseudomonas aeruginosa pa01
genomes were obtained from the institute for genomic
research (http://www.tigr.org) and the pseudomonas genome project (http://www.pseudomonas.com), respectively.

bacterial strains, plasmids, media and culture conditions
escherichia coli cultures were grown at 37c on luria-bertani (lb) medium (sambrook et al. 1989) supplemented
with the appropriate antibiotics. the following antibiotic
concentrations were used for the e. coli strains: tetracycline, 20 lg ml)1; kanamycin, 50 lg ml)1;  xxxd2193xxx ,
15 lg ml)1 and ampicillin, 100 lg ml)1. pseudomonas
putida strains were grown at 28c on mannitol-glutamate

ivet screening
a new genomic library of ps. putida 06909 for phytophthora-inducible ivet clones was constructed in priv16
as described in an earlier study (lee and cooksey 2000).
briefly, 2–8 kb sau3a size-fractionated dna fragments
were ligated into the bamhi site of priv16 to generate
the library. about 20 000 clones with inserts were

constructed, which was designed to represent all the dna
present in ps. putida in both orientations with respect to
the marker gene (pyrbc¢). recombinant plasmids were
maintained in e. coli dh5a, introduced into the pyrb
mutant strain ps. putida 06909u2 by tri-parental mating
with prk2013 as a helper plasmid, and grouped in pools
of 1000 transconjugants. each pool of the transconjugants carrying recombinant clones was applied to v8c
agar plates completely colonized by p. parasitica, at levels
of 60 000 cfu of bacteria per plate. after incubating for
24 h at 28c, the bacterial cells were harvested with 2 ml
of sterile water and reapplied to v8c agar fungal plates to
further enrich for phytophthora-induced clones. however,
enrichment more than twice resulted in the selection of
clones containing constitutive promoters, and not phytophthora-induced clones. finally, the cells were recovered
from phytophthora plates and were selected on v8c agar
supplemented with uracil (50 lg ml)1), tetracycline,
kanamycin and 80 lg of x-gal (5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-b-d-galactopyranoside) per millilitre. as a promoterless lacz gene in priv16 was cloned downstream from
pyrbc¢ as a transcriptional fusion, blue colonies contained
genes expressed in vitro and were eliminated. only white
colonies that contained cloned promoters induced specifically during colonization of p. parasitica were retained.
to confirm phytophthora induction and to eliminate sibling clones, the plasmids were recovered from the selected

clones and analysed by determining the restriction
enzyme digestion patterns obtained with ecori, sphi,
kpni, xbai, xhoi, clai and smai. the plasmids of 16
unique clones were reintroduced into ps. putida 06909u2
to confirm their induction by phytophthora.
gene disruption in pseudomonas putida 06909 by marker
exchange mutagenesis
marker exchange plasmids for disruption of phytophthora
mycelium-induced (pmi) genes in the ps. putida chromosome were constructed by crossover pcr for pmi-73 and
pmi-81 (yang et al. 2002), or with a commercial ez::tn
insertion kit (promega) for pmi-41 (fig. 1). briefly, the
crossover pcr strategy consisted of two rounds of pcr
amplification by using two sets of primers: primers a and
b for amplification of the left region flanking the
sequences targeted for disruption, and primers c and d
for amplification of the right region. each primer set was
designed to allow the amplification of more than 500 base
pairs (bp) for efficient homologous recombination. primer b contained, in the 5¢ to 3¢ direction, a 20-base
sequence complementary to the 5¢-end of primer c, an
asci endonuclease cleavage site (eight bases) for insertion
of a kanamycin gene, and 21 bases homologous to the
region close to the atg translation initiator. its complementary partner, primer c, also contained the 20-base

primer had a region (arrow) homologous to the genomic sequence, and primers b and c had a sequence (dark block) complementary to each
other. each primer set (a/b and c/d) was used for the first round of pcr amplification, respectively, and primers a/d were used for the second
round of pcr amplification. the gray region indicates the truncated pmi gene region and the dotted region indicates the downstream gene which

sequence complementary to the 5¢-end of primer b and
21 bases homologous to an interior site of the target gene
which determined the size of the deletion. by the complementary sequences contained in primers b and c, two
fragments produced by first round of pcr were annealed
to each other by heating at 94c for 4 min and then
slowly cooling to room temperature. after a short extension step at 72c for 10 min, the second round of pcr
amplification was performed by using primers a and d
designed to anneal upstream and downstream of the target gene, respectively. primer d in the pmi-73 clone was
designed as a degenerate primer based on the dcta
sequence from ps. putida kt2440 and ps. aeruginosa
pa01. the final mutagenic pcr fragments obtained from
the second pcr was cloned into pgem-t easy (promega), and then a kamamycin gene from pgem-km was
inserted into the asci site. for the pmi-41 clone, after
insertion of a commercial ez::tn, including a kamamycin gene instead of using the crossover pcr strategy, pcr
amplification using primers a and d was performed, and
its product was cloned into pgem-t easy. the resulting
construct was recloned into the noti site of pjq200sk
(quandt and hynes 1993). following tri-parental mating
with prk2013 as a helper plasmid on ydc (yeast-dextrose-calcium carbonate agar) plates for 20 h as described
earlier (yang et al. 1994), the cells were suspended in
sterile distilled water, serially diluted and plated onto paf
agar medium containing ampicillin, kanamycin and 5%
sucrose (ried and collmer 1987). sucrose-resistant colonies were tested for  xxxd2193xxx  sensitivity to select for
double-crossover recombinants ( xxxd2193xxx -sensitive).
chromosomal dna was isolated from putative mutant
strains, and pcr was used to confirm the mutations
using primers a and d. southern hybridization using
kanamycin and  xxxd2193xxx  genes as probes was also
performed for the final confirmation. these double crossover mutants were named 41tn, 73 km and 81 km,
respectively.
promoter induction assays
a quantitative b-galactosidase assay of pmi genes was performed as described earlier (lee and cooksey 2000).
briefly, v8c agar discs covered by actively growing
p. parasitica and supplemented with uracil were inoculated with ps. putida 06909u2 transconjugants carrying
selected plasmids. after incubation for 20–24 h, the agar
discs were dropped into 1 ml of sterile water, resuspended
to release the bacterial cells grown on the discs, and
assayed for b-galactosidase activity, as described by miller
(1972). the controls included an agar disc that was not
inoculated with bacteria and an agar disc that was inoculated with ps. putida 06909u2 (priv16).

oomycete-induced bacterial genes

a b-galactosidase assay was qualitatively performed
with p. parasitica-spent medium and the biolog gn2
microplates (biolog, hayward, ca, usa) to study the
nutritional factors stimulating the pmi gene expression.
preparation of the p. parasitica-spent medium was performed as described earlier (fedi et al. 1997). phytophthora parasitica was grown on sg agar (andrew 1980) to
cover the whole plate for 7 days, and then was overlaid
with 10 ml of sg soft agar (0æ2% agar). after incubation
for 3 days, the overlay was collected and centrifuged at
12 000 g for 20 min. the supernatant was adjusted to ph
7æ0 and filter sterilized. the assay was performed in a 96well polystyrene microtitre plate (costar 3596; corning
inc., corning, ny, usa), to which 100 ll of p. parasitica-spent medium, 50 ll of m9 minimal medium supplemented with glucose, 1 ll of of x-gal solution
(20 mg ml)1) and 10 ll of bacterial suspension of a pmi
fusion strain (od600  0æ02) were added per well. when
assayed in biolog gn2 microplates? (biolog), each well
included 125 ll of a suspension of a pmi clone suspended
in m9 minimal medium supplemented with glucose,
which was adjusted to od  0æ002, and 1 ll of x-gal
solution (20 mg ml)1). after 24 h of incubation, the
plates were observed for expression of the lacz reporter
gene by the appearance of a blue colour.
utilization of various carbon sources
biolog gn2 microplates? (biolog) were used according to
the directions of the manufacturer to determine the differences in the ability of mutants and wild type to oxidize
95 different carbon sources. the colour reaction was
read by a microplate spectrophotometer (spectramax
340pc; molecular devices, sunnyvale, ca, usa).
colonization and growth inhibition on phytophthora
mycelia
mycelial colonization of three mutants was observed
along the edge of the mycelial colony. two agar patches
(3 mm · 3 mm) of actively growing p. parasitica on v8c
were transferred onto each v8c plate. after the phytophthora were allowed to grow for 2 days at 28c, each
mutant and wild type was spot-inoculated on the edge of
one of the fungal colonies with sterile toothpicks and
incubated for 24 h.
phytophthora growth inhibition was assessed by directly
inoculating these strains onto mycelial agar discs as described earlier (yang et al. 1994). an agar disc containing
mycelium of p. parasitica was transferred to the centre of
two kinds of agar plates, paf and v8c. wild-type
ps. putida 06909 or each mutant was inoculated to the
centre of the mycelial surface with toothpicks. all the

plates were incubated for 7–8 days at 28c until the control plate containing only a mycelial disc without bacteria
almost covered the whole plate. the phytophthora growth
on each plate was measured as a diameter of the phytophthora colony. the diameter of each phytophthora colony
was the mean between the longest and the shortest diameters of the colony. each treatment included three
replications.
competitive assay on mycelial mats
the growth of the mutants alone or mixed with the wild
type was assessed on mycelial surfaces. overnight cultures
of the wild type and each mutant were diluted to
od600  1æ0 in water, and also mixed at a proportion of
1 : 1. phytophthora mycelial colonies grown for 5 days on
v8c agar were inoculated at the edge of the colony with
20 ll of each individual inoculum, or mixed inoculum of
the wild type and each mutant strain. after incubation for
24 h at 28c, bacteria were recovered from the mycelial
colonies in 3 ml of sterile water, and viable cells from each
population were determined by dilution plating on two
kinds of selective media. both the wild type and each
mutant could grow on lb agar medium supplemented with
ampicillin (200 lg ml)1). however, only the mutants could
grow on lb agar medium supplemented with kanamycin
(50 lg ml)1). population data (cfu ml)1) from three replications were averaged, and the standard error (se) of each
mean was calculated.
motility and chemotaxis assays
each strain was stab-inoculated to the centre of a lb soft
agar (0æ3% agar) plate with a sterile toothpick and incubated for 17 h at 28c. motility was then assessed through
quantification, by examining the circular turbid zone
formed by the bacterial cells migrating away from the point
of inoculation. a chemotaxis assay was performed towards
tryptone as described earlier (espinosa-urgel et al. 2000).
a water-agar solution (0æ2%, w/v) mixed with bacterial suspensions of the wild type or each mutant was poured onto
the plates containing a drop of tryptone solution (1%, w/v)
in the centre of the bacterial plate and incubated at 28c
(taguchi et al. 1997). after 5 h, a concentric halo around
the mycelium or the tryptone was observed as a positive.

results
isolation of pseudomonas putida genes induced during
colonization of phytophthora mycelial surfaces and
induction of their promoters
the library of ps. putida dna constructed in priv16,
including a promoterless pyrb¢c-lacz fusion and introduced into pyrb mutant strain (ps. putida 06909u2), was
applied onto phytophthora mycelial mats grown on pyrimidine-deficient v8c agar medium. the clones surviving
in this interaction were considered as having actively
expressed promoters, which drove the pyrb gene, from
the random library. plating of these clones onto the v8c
agar medium including a pyrimidine source (uracil) and
x-gal as a substrate for lacz expression allowed the separation of clones with a promoter, which is specifically
induced on phytophthora mycelia (white colonies), from
clones with a constitutive promoter (blue colonies). these
promoters are referred to as pmi promoters in this study.
from this initial screening, several hundred clones were
selected as potential pmi clone candidates. for confirmation and quantification of phytophthora induction, the
expression of the lacz gene of the pmi fusions was examined on a mycelia-covered agar plug compared with those
grown on an agar plug without mycelia. finally, 16
unique pmi fusions were selected by the quantitative bgalactosidase assay (fig. 2) and the restriction enzyme
digestion pattern analysis (data not shown). these pmi
fusions exhibited at least 2–15-fold higher induction levels
on phytophthora mycelial surfaces compared with the
growth on agar surfaces without mycelia (fig. 2).
sequence analysis of pmi fusions
to identify the upstream insert promoters driving expression of pyrbc¢ in the pmi clones by phytophthora signals,
at least 500 bp upstream of pyrbc¢ of each pmi clone was
sequenced and amongst them, three clones (pmi-41, pmi73 and pmi-81) were completely sequenced for further
study. the resulting sequence data were used to search
for similarities with published sequences in the genbank
database and for functions in the clusters of orthologous
groups of proteins (cog) database. as summarized in
table 1, 13 of the pmi loci are predicted to be involved in
metabolic pathways, such as energy production and conversion (pmi-4 and pmi-7), carbohydrate metabolism and
transport (pmi-10, pmi-73, pmi-81, pmi-90, pmi-97 and
pmi-102), amino acid metabolism and transport (pmi-41,
pmi-93 and pmi-99) and nucleotide metabolism (pmi-85,
pmi-86 and pmi-91). most of these deduced amino acid
sequences showed high similarities to the corresponding
proteins in ps. aeruginosa  xxxg2178xxx . two other loci (pmi-84

and pmi-101) could not be assigned any probable function.
growth properties of three pmi mutants in vitro
to characterize the three pmi mutants (41tn, 73 km and
81 km), we measured their growth rates in m9 minimal
medium supplemented with glucose and lb medium. in
no case was the growth rate in either medium significantly different from the wild type (data not shown), suggesting that the disrupted genes were not indispensable
for bacterial growth in vitro. however, the mutant 81 km
showed a slightly longer lag phase in lb medium, probably because the disrupted gene (putative glyceraldehyde3-phosphate dehydrogenase) might be interconnected
with other metabolic pathways supporting fast growth in
a rich medium. as judged by the growth on minimal
medium supplemented only by glucose, these three
mutants are not auxotrophs. the ability of these mutants
to oxidize various carbon substances provided by the biolog microplates was also measured. the mutant 41tn
showed a significantly weaker reaction for a-aminobutylic
acid, while 73 km showed a weak reaction for q-hydroxyphenyl acetic acid and  xxxd3251xxx  and a stronger reaction for a-d-glucose. the reactions by the mutant 81 km
were slightly different from that of the wild type for many
carbon sources, such as l-arabonose,  xxxd3055xxx  methyl
ester,  xxxd3251xxx  mono-methyl ester, acetic acid,
 xxxd2537xxx ,  xxxd3029xxx , l-alaninamide,  xxxd2460xxx ,
phenylethly amide and 2- xxxd102xxx .

colonization and inhibition of phytophthora mycelia
as reported earlier (lee and cooksey 2000), ps. putida
06909 colonizes along the edge of the mycelial colony
from the inoculation spot and gradually spreads toward
the centre of the mat. during incubation for 12 h, 81 km
did not colonize further from the inoculation spot, while
two other mutants, 41tn and 73 km, as well as the wild
type, colonized the entire edge of the mycelial colony
(data not shown). after 24 h of incubation, 81 km also
colonized the entire edge of a mycelial colony. when each
of these mutants mixed with the wild type was inoculated
onto the mycelial colonies, the population of the mutant
was reduced compared with that of the wild type
(table 2), suggesting that the mutants were not as competitive for phytophthora colonization as the wild type.
the reduced populations of the mutants was not likely
owing to an impaired ability of the mutants to utilize
nutrients in the v8c medium used in the assay, because
when each of these mutants was inoculated individually
onto the discs containing p. parasitica mycelia, all the
bacteria grew similar to the wild type, fully colonizing
phytophthora mycelium and inhibiting phytophthora
growth (data not shown).
other phenotypic characterization of pmi mutants
motility has been shown to be important in establishing
cell-surface contacts during colonization and further biofilm formation. however, it costs more energy to synthe-

colony size, but probably would not account for the large
differences observed between this mutant and the wild
type.
nutritional factors as phytophthora signals
in order to test whether nutritional factors produced by
p. parasitica can induce the pmi gene promoters, we first
tested the induction of three pmi gene promoters using a
phytophthora-spent medium. as shown in fig. 3, when
the pmi clones were incubated in a microtitre plate containing m9 minimal medium including p. parasitica-spent
medium and x-gal solution for 24 h, the promoter induction was observed by the appearance of blue colour. two
out of the three pmi gene promoters (pmi-41 and pmi-81)
showed a strong reaction (blue colour), and pmi-73 presented a slight reaction, indicating that these pmi genes
can be induced by the substances diffused from p. parasitica in culture. in the promoter induction assay using
biolog microplates containing 95 different carbon sources
(table 4), all three of these pmi genes were induced by
glycogen, which suggested that they may be induced by
phytophthora cell wall components. these pmi genes were
also induced by other substances, such as organic acids
and amino acids, including some that were utilized by
ps. putida, suggesting that fungal constituents or exudates
with similar composition might induce these pmi genes
and provide substrates for the bacterium on mycelial surfaces.

discussion
as an initial step for the better understanding of the
molecular mechanisms involved in bacterial colonization
of phytophthora mycelia, we have used the ivet strategy
(handfield and levesque 1999; rainey and preston 2000).
this ivet-based strategy has been applied to the study of
other plant-associated bacteria. for example, genes that
are preferentially expressed in the rhizosphere have been
identified in ps. fluorescens and ps. putida (bayliss et al.
1997; rainey 1999), and genes that are induced during
infection of arabidopsis thaliana have been identified in
ps. syringae pv. tomato (boch et al. 2002). in our ivet
screening using pyrb¢c-lacz fusion as a selection marker,
we originally identified five genes in ps. putida with
increased expression on phytophthora mycelial surfaces.
sequence analysis showed that three of these were related
to genes with earlier described functions, including a diacylglycerol kinase, an  xxxg22xxx , and an outer
membrane porin (lee and cooksey 2000). in the present
study, sequence analysis of an additional 16 strongly
induced pmi genes revealed that many of them displayed
similarity to genes known or predicted to be involved in
diverse carbon catabolism, amino acid/nucleotide metabolism and transport processes. this study has therefore
expanded our understanding of the differential gene
expression patterns of ps. putida under these conditions.
we demonstrated earlier that the adherence to hyphae
and siderophore production by ps. putida 06909 are
important in the inhibition of phytophthora (yang et al.
1994), but in the current study, no additional functions
that provide obvious explanations for the observed biological control effect of ps. putida 06060 on phytophthora
were identified (turney 1995; steddom et al. 2002).
instead, it appears that successful colonization and inhibition of phytophthora by ps. putida involves the induction
of multiple metabolic pathways, in addition to adherence
and competition for iron.
the discovery of a glnk homolog (pmi-4) suggests that
ps. putida on the mycelial surface is under metabolic
stress, such as starvation for an essential nutrient, because
the pii-like signal transduction protein encoded by glnk
is known to be involved in nitrogen regulation under
nitrogen starvation (van heeswijk et al. 1996; ninfa and
atkinson 2000). the same gene was also identified in
another fusion (pmi-33, not shown in table 1) which
spans more dna downstream of glnk to amtb that
encodes a membrane-bound ammonium transport protein, and usually consists of an operon with glnk in several bacteria (meletzus et al. 1998; ninfa and atkinson
2000; thomas et al. 2000; coutts et al. 2002).
in pmi-41, the gene gabd encoding a succinate semialdehyde dehydrogenase homolog (p25526) is known in

some bacteria to be a gene of the gab cluster, gabcdpt,
which specifies the synthesis of the enzymes of the c-aminobutyrate (gaba) degradation pathway (dover and
halpern 1972; metzer and halpern 1990) and is responsible for the conversion of succinic semialdehyde into
succinate. the activation of the gab gene expression by
nitrogen deprivation has been demonstrated earlier to be
mediated by the gln regulatory system (ntr) (kahane
et al. 1978; zaboura and halpern 1978). however, in ps.
putida kt2440 and ps. aeruginosa pa01, only two genes,
gabd and gabt ( xxxg8xxx , p22256), are
known to appear in a cluster. the gabt protein catalyses
the conversion of gaba into succinic semialdehyde
(bartsch et al. 1990), and was recently reported to be
involved in lysine metabolism and to be rhizosphereinduced in ps. putida kt2440 (espinosa-urgel and ramos
2001). therefore, it is possible that the fungal induction
of gabd in this study is because of the exudates produced
by phytophthora mycelia and the nutrient (nitrogen) limitation on the mycelial surface.
two loci (pmi-73 and pmi-10) induced by phytophthora
mycelia are predicted to be involved in c4-dicarboxylic
acid transport and metabolism, respectively. the gene
dcta (pmi-73), encoding a c4- xxxd2537xxx  transport
protein, is known to be a gene of the dct system of rhizobia, where the organization of the dct locus is conserved
and consists of a three-gene cluster together with two regulatory genes (dctb and dctd). however, in ps. putida and
ps. aeruginosa, no similar genes were found upstream or
downstream from dcta in the genome sequence. in rhizobia, the dctb and dctd gene products function as a twocomponent system, together with sigma factor r54, for the
expression of dcta under free living conditions in
response to the presence of dicarboxylic acids (yarosh
et al. 1989). as the c4-dicarboxylic acids are known to be
transported and metabolized in symbiotic associations
between rhizobia and leguminous plants, the compounds
128

might be acquired by the bacterium from phytophthora in
this interaction. in e. coli, c4-dicarboxylic acids are
known to be utilized as carbon and energy sources
(davies et al. 1999). a malic enzyme homolog encoded
by pmi-10 catalyses the reductive carboxylation of pyruvate to give malate as an anaplerotic pathway, where the
 xxxd1710xxx  cycle intermediates would be replenished to
maintain the flux through the cycle. the induction by
these two loci was shown to be about sixfold greater than
those of the same clones in the absence of the fungus
(fig. 2). thus, c4- xxxd2537xxx  transport and metabolism might be involved in this bacterial–phytophthora
interaction.
carbon catabolism and the related energy metabolism
seem to play important roles in the bacterial colonization
on mycelial surfaces. recently, the global carbon metabolism regulator catabolite repression control (crc) was
reported to be a component of the signal transduction
pathway required for biofilm development by ps. aeruginosa (o’toole et al. 2000), which suggests that carbon
regulation could be a part of the pathway for the bacterial
colonization on mycelial surfaces. four pmi genes (pmi81, pmi-90, pmi-97 and pmi-102), which encode  xxxg861xxx , ribulose-phosphate
3-epimerase, transaldolase and enolase homologs, respectively, were shown to be highly expressed on the phytophthora mycelia, and might be involved in energy
production for colonization on them.
three of the fusions (pmi-85, pmi-86 and pmi-91) were
predicted to be involved in nucleotide and amino acid
biosynthesis (table 1). the genes cara (pmi-85) and carb
(pmi-91), encoding subunits of carbamoylphosphate
synthase small chain, are involved in pyrimidine biosynthesis and glutamate metabolism, and purm (pmi-86) is
involved in de novo purine biosynthesis. the car operon
is known to be regulated by argr, the terminal gene
product of the aot operon, which functions in control of

s.-j. ahn et al.

arginine metabolism in ps. aeruginosa (park et al.
1997a,b). as arginine metabolism is of considerable significance in ps. aeruginosa, which can use utilize this amino
acid as a good source of carbon, nitrogen and energy
(haas et al. 1990), the induction of these genes might be
involved in energy metabolism or other gene expressions
required for colonization of mycelia by ps. putida.
two pmi fusions involved in amino acid transport processes were identified in this screen. the polypeptide of
pmi-93 gene has high similarity with a component (aotj)
of a periplasmic binding protein-dependent transporter
for arginine and ornithine, which is usually organized in
an operon (aotjqmop-argr) with five other genes in ps.
aeruginosa (nishijyo et al. 1998). the terminal gene, argr,
in this operon is known to function in the control of
expression of certain genes of arginine biosynthesis and
catabolism, as well as in the control of expression of the
catabolic glutamate dehydrogenase (park et al. 1997a,b).
as a sequence structure similar to that of the rhoindependent terminator is known to be located in the
aotj-aotq intergenic region (nishijyo et al. 1998), other
downstream components of the transport system and
argr could be expressed differently from aotj. the other
fusion involved in amino acid uptake is pmi-99, for which
the deduced amino acid sequence is highly similar to the
sequence of the branched-chain amino acid transport
protein brcc in ps. aeruginosa, and liv-i and ls transport proteins in e. coli belonging to the hydrophobic
amino acid transporter (haat) families of abc transporters of amino acids (saier 2000; hosie and poole
2001). these proteins are expected to be involved in the
transport of neutral and aliphatic amino acids, such as
leucine, isoleucine, valine, threonine and alanine.
recently, the bra transporter of rhizobium leguminosarum
was reported to transport a broad range of solutes including acidic and basic polar amino acids, and gaba, as
well as hydrophobic and neutral amino acids (hosie and
poole 2001). therefore, the induction of genes involved
in the amino acid uptake of phytophthora in this study
suggests that the uptake of amino acids could be a bacterial trait involved in bacterial colonization, in addition to
the ability of pseudomonas to synthesize amino acids
(simons et al. 1997).
some of the pmi genes, such as gabd (pmi-41), dcta
(pmi-73) and brac (pmi-99) are correlated with rhizosphere-induced genes (simons et al. 1997; rainey 1999;
espinosa-urgel and ramos 2001), suggesting that similar
or common mechanisms might be involved in bacterial
colonization to mycelial surfaces as well as to root surfaces (rhizosphere). this is supported by the fact that
some of the composition of root exudates, consisting of
sugars, organic acids and amino acids, is similar to that
of fungal constituents or exudates used for bacterial

oomycete-induced bacterial genes

survival and adaptation (bartnicki-garcia 1966; lugtenberg et al. 1999; singh and arora 2001). as some of the
rhizosphere-induced genes of pseudomonas biocontrol
strains have been known to be highly expressed in
response to root exudates (lugtenberg et al. 1999;
vilchez et al. 2000; espinosa-urgel and ramos 2001),
phytophthora constituents or exudates with a similar composition might be able to induce the pmi genes required
for complete colonization, and provide substrates for the
bacterium on mycelial surfaces. all the three pmi genes
tested were highly expressed by p. parasitica-spent medium as well as various substances, such as organic acids
and amino acids, suggesting that many of the phytophthora signals stimulating the pmi gene expression might
be involved in bacterial nutrition. it is notable that all the
three genes are induced by glycogen that was not utilized
by the ps. putida strains. glycogen is a type of branched
homopolysaccharide produced as a storage product in
phytophthora. related glucan polymers make up the cell
wall of phytophthora. thus, the pmi gene expression
might be stimulated by cell wall or storage components
of phytophthora. the diffusible signals produced by the
phytopathgenic oomycete pythium ultimum have been
reported to repress the expression of ps. fluorescens f113
genes (fedi et al. 1997; smith et al. 1999). however, the
method by which the repression is recognized and processed by the bacterium is unknown. thus, understanding
the in vivo signals produced by phytophthora and their
target genes would provide deeper insight into the mechanisms on bacterial signal transduction and developmental colonization processes.
although all the three pmi mutants appeared to be
indistinguishable from the parental strain with respect to
the growth rate, the biolog assay showed differential oxidation of the different carbon substances. particularly, the
mutant 81 km differed in oxidation of several carbon
sources, suggesting that the disrupted glyceraldehyde-3phosphate dehydrogenase gene may affect different metabolic pathways. the mutant 81 km presented slower
adaptation to mycelial surfaces as shown in table 2, suggesting that the disrupted gene might be involved in the
bacterial ability to utilize the substances on mycelial surfaces. when each of these mutants was mixed with the
wild type and inoculated onto mycelial surfaces, their
populations were reduced.thus, these disrupted genes
might be required for full competitive colonization of the
mycelial surfaces.
phytophthora exudates act as attractants and growth
substrates for bacteria (singh and arora 2001), and bacterial growth and colonization on the mycelia might cause
nutrient stress or reduced vigour to phytophthora, affecting their growth (lim and lockwood 1988). none of
these pmi mutants seem to be significantly affected in its

ability to inhibit phytophthora growth on paf agar medium (data not shown), suggesting that these disrupted
genes might not be directly involved in antifungal activity.
however, when assayed on the v8c agar medium under
the same conditions, these mutants seemed to inhibit
mycelia growth more than the wild type (data not
shown), suggesting that these gene disruptions might
cause differential colonization of phytophthora mycelia
depending on the nutritional environment.
a significant alteration of the colony morphology was
observed in the mutant 81 km, but not in the other two
mutants. its smaller and rougher colony morphology
might be caused by an effect on bacterial surface structure
or surface association (wai et al. 1998; henderson et al.
1999; deziel et al. 2001). a similar morphological alteration was observed in the phenotypic variants of pseudomonas ssp., which were involved in motility, biofilm
formation and various traits important for the rhizosphere colonization (sanchez-contreras et al. 2002).
our results described earlier demonstrate that ivet
screening and mutant characterization can be used to
identify bacterial genes which are induced on the mycelial
surface. the study of nutritional signals that originated
from p. parasitica provided insight into the possible
mechanisms of mycelial colonization by this bacterium.
disruption of the genes highly expressed during colonization of the fungal mycelia can cause various phenotypic
changes affecting bacterial behaviour on mycelial surfaces.
