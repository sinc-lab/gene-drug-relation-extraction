discussion

fig. 1 shows the total and the nonspecific binding of [3h]
p1075 to endothelium-denuded rat aortic rings. computer
analysis of the data revealed a saturable binding component
to a single class of siteswith an equilibrium dissociation
constant, ko = 6 & 1nm and a binding capacity, b,,, = 21 k
3 fmol/mg, wet weight (fig. 1).the high affinity found here
in thebinding assay corresponds well to thepotency of p1075
as a vasorelaxant agent (14).
binding of 0.3 nm [3h]p1075 was inhibited concentration
dependently by unlabeled p1075 by up to 65% with a midpoint
(ki)of 3 nm, the nonspecific binding accounting for ~ 3 5 %
of
the total concentration of label bound. fig. 2a shows the
inhibition of specific binding by a series of k+ channel openers. the enantiomers of pinacidil, compounds structurally
related to p1075 (14), inhibited specific [3h]p1075 binding

completely and, inagreement with the limited stereoselectivity observed in functional studies(15,16), the(-)-enantiomer
was about 20 times more potent than the (+)-enantiomer
(fig.

(18), and minoxidil sulfate, nicorandil, and  xxxd1868xxx  were
"
also able to inhibit specific binding of [3h]p1075. the
benzpyran enantiomers sdz p c 0 400 and sdz p c 0 399

exception of brl 38227 and minoxidil sulfate which inhibited to 88 and 86%, respectively. data were fitted to the hill equation; hill
