metabolism of epinastine, a histamine  xxxg1078xxx  antagonist, in human liver microsomes in comparison with that of terfenadine.  epinastine is a non-sedative second-generation antiallergic drug, like terfenadine. in the present study, the metabolism of epinastine in human liver microsomes was investigated and compared with that of terfenadine. terfenadine was extensively metabolized to terfenadine acid with a km value of 1.78 microm, a vmax value of 173.8 pmol/min/mg and a metabolic clearance (vmax/km) of 103.9. epinastine, in contrast, was poorly metabolized by microsomes from the same source with a high km value of 232 microm. metabolic clearance of epinastine was only 0.832, which was lower by three orders of magnitude than that of terfenadine. studies with microsomes expressing recombinant cytochrome p450 (cyp) species revealed that the cyp isoforms responsible for epinastine metabolism are cyp3a4, 2d6 and (to a minor extent) 2b6. epinastine and terfenadine had no effect on cyp1a2 (theophylline 1-demethylation), 2c8/9 ( xxxd3394xxx  hydroxylation) or  xxxd851xxx  ( xxxd1681xxx  6-hydroxylation) activity, but weakly inhibited cyp2d6 ( xxxd1818xxx  4-hydroxylation) activity. cyp3a4 (testosterone 6 beta-hydroxylation) activity was strongly inhibited by terfenadine with a ki value of 25 microm, whereas epinastine had no effect at up to 100 microm. thus, epinastine is very poorly metabolized compared to terfenadine in human liver microsomes and does not inhibit cyp3a4 activity in vitro, unlike terfenadine.
