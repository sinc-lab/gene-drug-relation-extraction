some of these data were previously presented to the british pharmacological society in january 1999.

it is becoming increasingly clear that environmental stimuli play a critical role in the maintenance of drug
taking behaviour. this has led to investigations into the neural mechanisms by which environmental stimuli
can come to control behaviour using paradigms such as conditioned reinforcement. the majority of this
work has involved the use of food-paired conditioned stimulus rodent paradigms. relatively few studies
have attempted to investigate the neuropharmacology of behaviour maintained by presentation of a
stimulus paired with ethanol drinking. several lines of research support an important role for brain
serotonin (5-ht) neurotransmitter systems in the control of alcohol drinking behaviour. the aim of the
present study was, initially, to establish a procedure in which rats respond for an  xxxd102xxx paired
conditioned stimulus, and second, to study the effects of a range of serotonergic compounds previously
shown to be effective in reducing oral ethanol self-administration, on responding for this conditioned
stimulus. results showed that the 5-ht releaser d-fenfluramine, the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor
fluoxetine, the  xxxg1108xxx  agonist 8-hydroxy-2[di-n-propylamino]tetralin, the partial  xxxg1108xxx 
agonist buspirone, and the 5-ht1b/ xxxg1115xxx  agonist 1-(3-trifluoromethylphenyl)piperazine, but not
the 5-ht2a/ xxxg1115xxx  agonist 1-(2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodophenylaminopropane)-2, selectively reduced
responding on a lever leading to presentation of an ethanol paired conditioned stimulus. in addition the
non-specific d1/d2 dopamine receptor antagonist haloperidol was active in this paradigm. results are
consistent with involvement of the dopaminergic and 5-ht systems, in particular activation of 5-ht1a and 5ht1b receptor subtypes, in mediation of the conditioned or secondary reinforcing properties of ethanol.

introduction
a large body of research indicates that behavioural and
environmental factors play an important role in the acquisition and
maintenance of drug taking behaviour (spealman and goldberg,
1978; barrett, 1985; spealman, 1985; spears and katz, 1991;
roberts and richardson, 1992; baum, 1993). it has been suggested
that humans may come to associate specific environments and/or
certain behavioural patterns with drug taking and the
pharmacological/reinforcing effects of the drug. one common
example is the licensed bar, which may become associated with
drinking alcoholic beverages, due to the behavioural and
environmental conditioning associated with previous or expected
associations of the pharmacological effects of ethanol with the bar.
in a similar manner, it would appear that stimuli associated with
the reinforcing properties of drugs may come to elicit some aspects
of the direct effects of the drug itself (conditioned reinforcers). in

one important study, levine (1974) reported that individuals
experienced in narcotic drug use derive pleasure from the injection
of inert substances particularly when the drug is expected. this
phenomenon is known as ‘needle freaking’. given the strong link
between environment, behaviour and drug abuse, it is considered
that by manipulating the environmental and/or behavioural
sequalae associated with drug taking, the neurochemical
mechanism(s) by which these behaviours impact the reinforcing
properties of drug self-administration could be determined.
in paradigms of conditioned reward, responding is maintained
through a process of classical conditioning. by this process, an
initially neutral stimulus (e.g. a brief visual or auditory stimulus)
associated with a reinforcer may come to acquire reinforcing
properties in its own right and become a conditioned stimulus,
which then produces a positive motivational state similar to that
elicited by the drug itself. it is activation of this incentive
motivational state by the conditioned stimulus that primes the

animal to continue responding in the absence of the primary
reinforcer itself. investigation of behaviour maintained by the
conditioned stimulus has been suggested to provide a means to
investigate drug-seeking behaviour (markou et al., 1993; robinson
and berridge, 1993; for a recent review, see jentsch and taylor,
1999).
there is increasing evidence from both pre-clinical and clinical
studies for a critical involvement of central serotonergic (5-ht)
neurotransmitter systems in the control of alcohol drinking. indeed
several reviews have been written on the subject (e.g. sellers et al.,
1992; lemarquand et al., 1994; pettinati, 1996). we have
attempted to investigate the influence of 5-ht systems in different
aspects of alcohol reinforced behaviour using oral alcohol selfadministration (wilson et al., 1998) and drug discrimination
paradigms (wilson et al., 1996). previous studies in our laboratory,
and elsewhere, have suggested that activation of the 5-ht system
attenuates the reinforcing properties of ethanol in the rat. however,
while 5-ht is clearly involved in mediation of the primary
reinforcing and interoceptive effects of ethanol as measured in selfadministration and drug discrimination paradigms (signs and
schechter, 1988; grant and colombo, 1993; wilson et al., 1996;
maurel et al., 1998; szeliga and grant, 1998), it remains unclear
what role, if any, 5-ht plays in the conditioned, or secondary
reinforcing properties of ethanol. this is a particularly important
question, because it is this feature of ethanol reward that may be
responsible for the maintenance of alcohol drinking behaviour and
also relapse in alcohol-free individuals, i.e. alcohol craving.
the aim of the present study was initially to establish a
procedure whereby rats would respond for an  xxxd102xxx paired
conditioned stimulus in the absence of ethanol, the primary
reinforcer. second, we aimed to determine the effects of a number
of compounds, previously shown to be effective to reduce oral selfadministration of ethanol in an operant paradigm (wilson et al.,
1998) on responding for an  xxxd102xxx paired conditioned stimulus.
thus, the 5-ht releaser d-fenfluramine, the selective serotonin
reuptake inhibitor fluoxetine, the  xxxg1108xxx  agonist 8hydroxy-2[di-n-propylamino]tetralin (8-oh-dpat), the partial  xxxg1108xxx  receptor agonist buspirone, the 5-ht1b/ xxxg1115xxx 
agonist 1-(3-trifluoromethylphenyl)piperazine (tfmpp), the 5ht2a/5-ht2c
receptor
agonist
1-(2,5-dimethoxy-4iodophenylaminopropane)-2 (doi), and the non-specific d1/d2
dopamine receptor antagonist haloperidol were used to investigate
the role of 5-ht, and to a limited extent, dopamine in the
conditioned, or secondary, reinforcing properties of ethanol.

materials and methods
animals
thirty female sprague-dawley (sd) rats obtained from bantin and
kingman, uk, weighing 250–350 g at the beginning of
experiments were used as subjects. rats were housed in single sex
colonies in groups of at least 3 and no more than 6. the holding
room was maintained under conditions of constant temperature
(21 ± 1 °c), humidity (40–50%) and lighting (lights on 0700–1900.
rats were given ad libitum access to standard laboratory chow and
tap water, except when this was modified for an experimental
procedure. animals were allowed a period of at least 2 weeks of
adaptation to their environment before experiments commenced.
all conditioned reinforcement training and testing took place

341

between 09.00 h and 17.00 h and rats were allowed a minimum of
30 min to habituate to the test room before experiments began.
apparatus
the operant chamber was constructed in house and was similar to a
standard skinner box except for its size, i.e. it was considerably
larger (40 cm high × 50 cm × 40 cm). it contained a liquid dipper
system with a cup capacity of 0.1 ml (previously described in detail
in wilson et al., 1988) located centrally between two retractable
levers. the dipper mechanism was located within a recess and the
rats had to open a perspex flap in order to take a drink. there was
an led light located 7 cm above each lever, and a noise delivery
system (a buzzer) located 27 cm above the dipper.
procedure: training
animals were reduced to approximately 85% of their free-feeding
body weight and maintained at a reduced weight by rationing their
food supply to 12 g per rat per day. for the initial training, rats
were deprived of water at least 1 h prior to each training session
and given their daily food ration in the home cage, in the absence
of water during that time. initially, animals were placed
individually into the operant self-administration apparatus for a
period of 30 min to allow them to habituate to the test chamber.
during this time, the liquid dipper was automatically activated
every 30 s, delivering 0.1 ml of a 20% w/v sucrose solution into the
operant chamber. the dipper flap was held open for the first
2–3 days. following 2 days of habituation, sucrose was replaced
with water as the drinking solution for a further 3 days. animals
were periodically monitored visually over this time to ascertain
whether the liquid was being ingested. rats were then trained to
associate a compound conditioned stimulus with the delivery of
water. the compound conditioned stimulus consisted of the houselight being turned off, the led above each lever being turned on
for a period of 1 sec, the buzzer emitting a tone of 75 db at
300 mm from origin, with a frequency of 400 ± 50 hz for 0.05 s,
and the characteristic sound associated with activation of the drug
delivery mechanism. over 10 consecutive daily sessions, the
conditioned stimulus was presented for a duration of 1 s every 30 s
for a total period of 30 min in conjunction with delivery of water,
with the levers retracted, so that the animals learned to associate
water presentation with the conditioned stimulus. ethanol was then
introduced as the drinking solution in gradually increasing
concentrations of 1%, 2%, 4%, 5% and finally 8% (v/v) ethanol.
animals were given at least three sessions of access to each
concentration of ethanol and were required to ingest at least 10
dippers of fluid (1 ml of ethanol) for three consecutive sessions
before the next concentration was presented as the drinking fluid.
following 10 consecutive daily sessions of access to 8% ethanol,
animals observed to ingest more than 10 dipper deliveries of 8%
ethanol (equivalent to an ethanol intake of approximately
0.25 g/kg) were given their daily food ration after the test session
and allowed free access to water prior to testing. following this,
subjects were given a further 10 consecutive sessions of access to
8% ethanol, in the absence of water deprivation and when fed after
testing.

deliveries of 8% (v/v) ethanol (≥ 0.25 g/kg ethanol) for at least 10

consecutive daily 30 min test sessions, under these conditions,
were used to test whether the ethanol paired conditioned stimulus
had acquired secondary reinforcing properties. for this test, two
retractable levers were introduced into the chamber. one lever was
designated the conditioned reinforcement lever (cr) and the other
the non-conditioned reinforcement lever (ncr). for half the rats,
the left lever was the cr lever while for the other half the right
lever was the cr lever, preventing a position preference from
influencing the results. responding on the cr lever resulted in
presentation of the conditioned stimulus, including activation of
the dipper arm, with the exception that the fluid reservoir was
empty, i.e. the dipper cup did not contain 8% ethanol. responding
on the ncr lever was recorded but had no programmed
consequence. test sessions were carried out for a period of 30 min
during which responding on both levers and the number of
conditioned stimulus presentations were recorded. these sessions
were continued for 10 consecutive sessions and the conditioned
stimulus was considered to have acquired control over the animals’
behaviour (and reinforcing properties) when animals made at least
10 responses on the cr lever and less than half this number on the
ncr lever.
responding on the cr and ncr levers was subsequently
examined following administration of drugs previously found to
significantly reduce oral self-administration of 8% ethanol in an
operant paradigm, in the absence of effects on locomotor activity
(wilson et al., 1998). the 5-ht releasing agent d-fenfluramine, 5ht re-uptake inhibitor fluoxetine,  xxxg1108xxx  agonist 8-ohdpat, partial  xxxg1108xxx  agonist buspirone, 5-ht1b/5-ht2c
receptor agonist tfmpp and the 5-ht2a/ xxxg1115xxx  agonist
doi, in addition to the non-specific d1/d2 dopamine receptor
antagonist haloperidol were tested. only doses found to
significantly and selectively reduce performance in the operant oral
self-administration paradigm were used (wilson et al., 1998). drug
testing was generally carried out twice a week, on tuesdays and
fridays, while training continued on other weekdays, i.e. animals
had access to ethanol only on training days. each drug study was
performed with the same rats, in the order stated above and
separated by a period of at least 1 week during which time animals
continued to be trained as stated. all rats regained baseline
responding levels before being reused for a subsequent study.
drugs
8-oh-dpat, doi and haloperidol were administered
subcutaneously (s.c.) and buspirone, d-fenfluramine, fluoxetine
and tfmpp were administered via the intraperitoneal (i.p.) route.
drugs were administered 30 min prior to testing. all compounds
were obtained from rbi (research biochemical international,
usa), with the exception of fluoxetine (sigma chemical co., st
louis, mo, usa) and haloperidol (baker norton healthcare, uk).
all compounds were formulated in 0.9% saline except haloperidol,
which was obtained as  xxxd2260xxx  (2 mg/ml) and diluted using 0.9%
saline and 5% acetic acid with 2 m naoh to ph 6. blood ethanol
determination was not performed for animals used in this study
because they were tested in the absence of ethanol.
statistical analysis
data from these studies were subject to square root transformation
in order to preserve homogeneity of variance (winer, 1971) and
analysed using a two-way anova with two within subjects

factors; lever and drug. post hoc analysis was carried out using
dunnett’s t-test.

results
eleven out of 30 rats were successfully trained to respond for an
 xxxd102xxx paired conditioned stimulus, making a minimum of 10
responses on the cr in the absence of water-deprivation and prefeeding. of the remaining 19 animals, two failed to nose poke for
water, a further three failed to nose poke for 5% ethanol and two
failed to nose poke for 8% ethanol. the remaining 12 rats acquired
the nose poke response for 8% ethanol, but failed to lever press for
presentation of the conditioned stimulus for a minimum of 10 lever
press responses. all animals achieving lever pressing criterion
made more than twice the number of responses on the cr
compared with the ncr. one-way anova revealed a highly
significant effect of lever selection [f(1,10) = 146.28, p < 0.001]
when tested on the last day of 10 test days, prior to drug
administration. in this session, rats made 45.4 ± 2.29 responses on
the cr lever and 10.4 ± 0.84 responses on the ncr lever.
effect of 5-ht compounds on responding for an
 xxxd102xxx paired conditioned stimulus
d-fenfluramine (0.3–1.0 mg/kg) had a significant effect on
responding for a conditioned stimulus previously paired with
delivery of 8% ethanol. a two-way anova revealed a significant
effect of lever [f(1,10) = 11.01, p < 0.01], drug [f(2,20) = 14.71,
p < 0.001] and a significant lever–drug interaction
[f(2,20) = 16.31, p < 0.001]. post hoc analysis showed that a dose
of 1.0 mg/kg of d-fenfluramine significantly reduced the number of
lever press responses made on the cr. this dose had no significant
effect on ncr responding (fig. 1b).
fluoxetine (1.0–10.0 mg/kg) significantly affected responding
for an  xxxd102xxx paired conditioned stimulus. a two-way anova
revealed a significant effect of lever [f(1,10) = 81.60, p < 0.001],
drug [f(3,30) = 15.06, p < 0.001] and a significant lever–drug
interaction [f(3,30) = 5.02, p < 0.01]. post hoc analysis revealed
that doses of 1.0 mg/kg (p < 0.05), 5.0 mg/kg (p < 0.01) and
10.0 mg/kg (p < 0.001) of fluoxetine all significantly reduced cr
responding. a dose of 10.0 mg/kg of fluoxetine also had a
significant effect to reduce ncr responding (p < 0.05, fig. 1c).
8-oh-dpat (0.1 mg/kg) also had a significant effect on
responding for an  xxxd102xxx paired conditioned stimulus. a two-way
anova revealed a significant effect of lever [f(1,10) = 21.55,
p < 0.001], drug [f(1,10) = 16.67, p < 0.001] and a significant
lever–drug interaction [f(1,10) = 11.30, p < 0.01]. post hoc
analysis showed that 0.1 mg/kg of 8-oh-dpat had a significant
effect to selectively reduce responding on the cr lever (p < 0.001).
thus, ncr responding failed to be significantly affected by this
dose (fig. 1a).
buspirone (1.0–5.0 mg/kg) had a significant effect on
responding for a conditioned stimulus paired with 8% ethanol. a
two-way anova revealed a significant effect of lever
[f(1,10) = 32.05, p < 0.001], drug [f(2,20) = 14.57, p < 0.001] and
a significant lever–drug interaction [f(2,20) = 19.72, p < 0.001].
post hoc analysis showed that both doses tested, 1.0 mg/kg
(p < 0.05) and 5.0 mg/kg (p < 0.01) of buspirone significantly
reduced the number of lever press responses made on cr.

furthermore, these doses of buspirone failed to significantly affect
responding on the ncr lever (fig. 2a).
tfmpp (0.1–0.3 mg/kg) significantly reduced responding for

revealed a significant effect of lever [f(1,10) = 7.09, p < 0.05],

that the highest dose of 0.3 mg/kg of tfmpp selectively and
significantly reduced cr responding (p < 0.001). no effect of
tfmpp was observed on ncr responding (fig. 2b).
in marked contrast, doi (0.5–1.0 mg/kg) failed to significantly
influence responding for an  xxxd102xxx paired conditioned stimulus. a

discussion
eleven animals maintained responding for the  xxxd102xxx paired
conditioned stimulus, indicating that for these rats, the conditioned
stimulus had become associated with the reinforcing properties of
8% ethanol presentation. thus, the conditioned stimulus came to

control the behaviour of these animals, which resulted in the
acquisition of a new behaviour, pressing a lever. the conditioned
stimulus further maintained responding most likely because it
acquired positive reinforcing properties in its own right, due to
association with the positive reinforcing properties of ethanol.
following acquisition of responding for the conditioned stimulus,
the animals responded significantly more on the cr than the ncr
lever, lending further support to the concept of stimulus control.
this lever preference was maintained throughout the duration of
these drug studies and responding on both levers was not
substantially different under vehicle conditions during all drug
studies. therefore, this paradigm was used to investigate the role of
5-ht in mediation of the conditioned or secondary reinforcing
properties of ethanol. the percentage of animals responding for the
conditioned stimulus is very similar to that achieved in our
previous self-administration work (wilson et al., 1997, 1998).
thus, it seems that the proportion of this heterogeneous outbred
strain of rats that will respond for the primary and secondary
reinforcing properties of ethanol is very similar.
few studies have investigated the ability of ethanol to gain
stimulus control over responding. hyytiä and sinclair (1991)
published a study indicative of stimulus control over responding
for ethanol, and demonstrated that genetically selected alcoholpreferring aa rats acquired stimulus control of ethanol responding
more rapidly than rats of the heterogeneous wistar strain. they
attributed this effect to aa rats having gained greater positive
reinforcement compared to wistar rats from a conditioned stimulus
paired with ethanol. it was suggested that this was indicative of aa
rats being more sensitive to the positive reinforcing properties of
ethanol. however, in that study, the animals did not respond for an
ethanol paired conditioned stimulus in the absence of ethanol,
rather they ingested ethanol only when its availability was
indicated by the presence of a stimulus light. in another study
(smith et al., 1977), a buzzer paired with intra-gastric ethanol selfadministration delayed extinction in an operant paradigm
suggesting that the buzzer had acquired conditioned reinforcing
properties. in a more recent study, closer in nature to the present
one, responding for an oral ethanol paired conditioned stimulus
was produced only when animals were injected with damphetamine directly into the nucleus accumbens (slawecki et al.,
1997). in that study, the ethanol paired conditioned stimulus failed
to initiate and maintain operant responding in the absence of
amphetamine treatment. therefore, the present study may be the
first to demonstrate acquisition and maintenance of lever pressing
for an ethanol paired conditioned stimulus in the rat in the absence
of pharmacological manipulation.
following acquisition of an  xxxd102xxx paired conditioned
stimulus, 5-ht compounds, at doses previously found to
selectively reduce oral self-administration of 8% ethanol (wilson et
al., 1998) were administered to animals responding for an ethanol
paired conditioned stimulus (to study the secondary reinforcing
effects of ethanol). the 5-ht agonists d-fenfluramine and
fluoxetine, the 5-ht receptor agonists 8-oh-dpat, buspirone and
tfmpp and the non-selective dopamine receptor antagonist
haloperidol, all significantly reduced responding on the cr lever at
doses which did not affect responding on the ncr lever. cr
responding was reduced to the level of ncr responding following
administration of most of these compounds. therefore, under the
influence of pharmacological activation of the 5-ht system, the
conditioned stimulus no longer had control over the animals’

behaviour. these data strongly indicate that these drugs had a
selective effect in reducing the reinforcing properties of the
conditioned stimulus. since responding on the ncr lever was not
associated with the reinforcing properties of ethanol, alterations in
responding on this lever may be used as an index of non-specific
changes in behaviour. ncr responding was not significantly
affected following administration of any drug except the highest
dose of fluoxetine, suggesting that the compounds used had a
selective effect to attenuate responding for the conditioned
stimulus only. therefore, a reduction in responding on the cr lever
is likely to be due to a reduction in the reinforcing properties of the
conditioned stimulus, and not because of an overall reduction in
general behaviour. thus the present data suggest that an increase in
5-ht neurotransmission produced a reduction in the incentive
motivational properties of ethanol.
one potential problem with interpretation of the present data is
the use of selected drug doses, e.g. only one dose of 8-oh-dpat
and haloperidol was used. however, in our previous ethanol selfadministration study (wilson et al., 1998), a much wider dose
range of these compounds was studied. the doses used in the
present work were specifically chosen to comprise doses that had a
selective effect on lever pressing for 8% ethanol without also
reducing locomotor activity, which was concomitantly measured in
that study. therefore the doses used here tended to be fairly low. it
is likely that a reduction in responding on the ncr lever would
also have been observed if larger doses were used, which would be
indicative of a non-specific attenuation of general operant
performance rather than a specific effect on reinforcing capacity of
the conditioned stimulus. indeed this effect was observed following
the highest dose of fluoxetine tested.
the results of the present study showing effects of 8-oh-dpat,
buspirone and tfmpp support a role for 5-ht1a and 5-ht1b
receptor subtypes in mediation of the conditioned reinforcing
effects of ethanol. however, without the use of selective receptor
antagonists, it is not possible to determine exactly which receptor
subtypes are responsible for the effects of these compounds. the
present data are mainly in agreement with the results obtained from
our self-administration studies (see wilson et al., 1998) which
showed d-fenfluramine, 8-oh-dpat, buspirone, tfmpp and doi
to have selective effects to reduce responding for 8% ethanol
without affecting locomotor activity over a limited dose range.
however, there are some differences between results of the two
studies. for example, haloperidol at a dose of 0.25 mg/kg had a
significant effect on cr responding only, which indicates a
selective reduction in the conditioned reinforcing effects of
ethanol. in marked contrast, this dose did not have a selective effect
on ethanol self-administration (i.e. both locomotor activity and
lever pressing were reduced). furthermore, 10.0 mg/kg of
fluoxetine did not appear to have a selective effect on the
conditioned reinforcing properties of ethanol as measured in the
present work, but did selectively attenuate ethanol selfadministration (wilson et al., 1998). perhaps most importantly,
doi failed to affect responding for a conditioned reinforcer but
significantly reduced ethanol self-administration (wilson et al.,
1998). this finding is particularly important since doi was
successful in selectively reducing ethanol preference in two-bottle
choice studies (wilson, unpublished observations), and oral selfadministration of 8% ethanol (wilson et al., 1998). this suggests
that the  xxxg1113xxx  subtype is more importantly involved in the
primary rather than the secondary reinforcing properties of ethanol.

the primary reinforcer) may suggest a more profound effect of the
dopaminergic system in the conditioned reinforcing effects of
ethanol. the different effects of haloperidol and fluoxetine and the
disparate results observed with doi may be explained by
differences in the test procedure. perhaps differences in the
strength of the primary and secondary reinforcers may have
resulted in differential motivation to respond in an operant test, and
may affect responding more in a situation when the motivation may
be less (i.e. cr studies). a more likely explanation could be that
there are important differences in the mechanism by which ethanol
produces its primary and secondary reinforcing effects. thus 5ht2 receptor mechanisms may be more importantly involved in its
primary reinforcing effects while the dopamine system exerts a
greater influence on the secondary reinforcing properties of
ethanol. in this context, the interoceptive and conditioned
reinforcing properties of ethanol may share some common
features. thus, compounds active at 5-ht1b and 5-ht2c receptors
have been shown to substitute for an ethanol discriminative
stimulus cue, while doi and  xxxd2419xxx  were found to be
ineffective, ruling out a role for 5-ht2a receptors (maurel et al.,
1998; szeliga and grant, 1998). it is important to note that, in the
case of drug discrimination, the 5-ht agonists substituted for
ethanol suggesting that ethanol may mediate some of its
interoceptive effects through activation of 5-ht receptors. in
contrast, in the conditioned reinforcement work, and indeed in selfadministration studies, the 5-ht agonists attenuated performance
suggesting that 5-ht receptor stimulation reduces the primary and
secondary reinforcing effects of ethanol. the mechanism by which
this effect occurs remains to be determined. it is possible that the
action of 5-ht agonists to reduce responding for ethanol and an
ethanol paired conditioned stimulus is mediated by replacement of
the reinforcement produced by ethanol.
previous studies using dopamine receptor antagonists have
shown that haloperidol reduces responding for a food-paired
conditioned stimulus (beninger et al., 1989; smith et al., 1997)
and several lines of evidence demonstrate that the mesolimbic
dopamine system is critically involved in mediation of conditioned
reward (taylor and robbins, 1984, 1986; cador et al., 1991;
kelley and delfs, 1991). indeed, results from a previous ethanol
operant conditioned stimulus study (slawecki et al., 1997) support
a role for dopamine neurotransmission within the nucleus
accumbens in mediation of the conditioned reinforcing effects of
ethanol. results of the present study together with the those of
slawecki and colleagues suggest that the secondary reinforcing
properties of ethanol share some common mechanisms with other
reinforcers, e.g. food and other drugs of abuse such as amphetamine and cocaine (beninger et al., 1989; jentsch and taylor, 1999).
it will be of considerable interest to determine neuroanatomical
substrates of the conditioned reinforcing properties of ethanol.
the present results strongly indicate that 5-ht is involved in the
reinforcing properties of an  xxxd102xxx paired conditioned stimulus.
these results are in agreement with a previous study showing an
involvement of 5-ht in the control of conditioned reinforcement
(fletcher, 1995). in that study, d-fenfluramine was shown to reduce
responding for a conditioned stimulus previously paired with water
presentation. in addition, the effect of d-amphetamine injection
directly into the nucleus accumbens to enhance responding for the
conditioned stimulus was attenuated following pre-treatment with

345

d-fenfluramine, suggesting an interaction between 5-ht and
dopamine systems at the level of the nucleus accumbens in the
mediation of conditioned reward. the present study further
supports a role for 5-ht in conditioned reward and suggests that a
5–ht dopamine interaction may also be important for the
conditioned reinforcing effects of ethanol. whether the nucleus
accumbens is the site of this interaction remains to be determined.
in summary, the present studies demonstrate the involvement of
5-ht and, in particular, 5-ht1a and  xxxg1109xxx  mechanisms
in addition to the dopamine system, in mediation of the conditioned,
or secondary, reinforcing properties of ethanol. in combination
with previous studies showing an important role for the 5-ht
system in the primary reinforcing effects of ethanol, these data
provide further evidence that drugs which act at 5-ht receptors
may be of value in the long-term treatment of alcohol dependence.
