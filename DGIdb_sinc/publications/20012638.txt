abstract terbutaline (bricanyl) and its prodrug  xxxd283xxx  ( xxxd283xxx ) are highly potent 2-adrenoceptor agonists
often used in asthma patients. terbutaline in the form
of inhaled short-acting bronchodilator relieves asthmatic
symptoms. however, the evects of  xxxd283xxx  given intratracheally have rarely been explored. to verify the evect of
 xxxd283xxx  and terbutaline, which act on the tracheal
smooth muscle directly in vitro, we used our preparation to
test the evects of  xxxd283xxx  on isolated rat’s tracheal
smooth muscle compared with terbutaline. the following
assessments of  xxxd283xxx  and terbutaline were performed:
(1) evect on tracheal smooth muscle resting tension; (2)
evect on contraction caused by 10¡6 m  xxxd2586xxx  as a
parasympathetic mimetic; (3) evect of the drugs on electrically induced tracheal smooth muscle contractions. the
results indicated that adding  xxxd283xxx  induced a signiwcant further contraction to 10¡6 m  xxxd2586xxx -induced
contraction when the preparation was increased to 10¡4 m.
but terbutaline elicited a relaxation response at a dose of
10¡6 m or more. both  xxxd283xxx  and terbutaline could
inhibit electrical weld stimulation (efs) induced spike
contraction. terbutaline had an anti-cholinergic evect that
could relieve asthmatic symptoms. but the evect of

introduction
during an asthma attack, the tracheal smooth muscle plays
an important role in reducing pulmonary function as it
contracts [1–4].  xxxd283xxx  ( xxxd283xxx ) and terbutaline
(bricanyl) are commonly used to solve this problem. these
2-adrenergic receptor agonists have shown to be evective
in controlling asthmatic symptoms and lung function by
relieving the contracted smooth muscle.  xxxd283xxx , a
long-acting bronchodilator, may be only given by the oral
route with a 24-h evective duration. however, terbutaline,
the hydrolytic metabolite of  xxxd283xxx , is a short-acting
bronchodilator aerosol that can be inhaled by the mouth [5].
the evect of delivering  xxxd283xxx  directly into the tracheal smooth muscle through inhalation is unknown.
we developed a simple and rapid test needed for screening parasympathetic mimetic agents and potential tracheal
contraction agents, and for identifying agents directly
avecting the tracheal smooth muscle [6, 7]. our technique
was based on previously described methods [2, 4, 8, 9] in
which 5 mm strips of rabbit trachea are suspended in a tissue bath containing 30 ml of kreb’s solution. one end of
the strip is attached to a steel plate and the other to an isometric transducer and a steel plate. a passive tension of
0.3 g is applied to the strips.
the purpose of this study was to determine the evects of
 xxxd283xxx  on isolated tracheal smooth muscle in vitro,
compared with terbutaline.

materials and methods

measurements

tissue sampling and preparation

the following assessments for  xxxd283xxx  were performed:
(1) evect on tracheal smooth muscle resting tension; (2)
evect of  xxxd283xxx  on contraction caused by 10¡6 m
 xxxd2586xxx ; (3) evect of  xxxd283xxx  on electrically
induced tracheal smooth muscle contractions. in each
experiment, one untreated strip served as a control. the
same procedures were performed for terbutaline. concentrations of drugs are expressed as concentrations present in
the 30-ml bath solution.

thirty rats were anesthetized by intraperitoneal administration of pentobarbital (45 mg/kg), and two pieces of trachea about 5 mm in length were removed from each rat.
this study was approved by an animal experiment review
board (lacuc-05-158). the equipment and process were
designed based on our previous study [7]. the tracheal
specimen was mounted using two steel plates and submersed in a 30-ml muscle bath at 37°c. the bath was
wlled with 30 ml kreb’s solution consisting of (mmol/l)
nacl, 118; kcl, 4.7; cacl2, 2.5;  xxxd2534xxx ·7h2o, 1.2;
kh2po4, 1.2; nahco3, 25.0; and glucose, 10.0. the
upper side of the tracheal strip was attached to a grass
ft-03 force displacement transducer (astromed, west
warwick, ri, usa) using a steel plate and a 3-0 silk ligature. the other side of the strip was wxed to a steel plate
attached to the bath. a passive tension of 0.3 g was
applied to the strips and subsequent changes in tension
were recorded continuously using chart v4.2 software
(powerlab, adinstruments, colorado springs, co, usa).
chemicals used were of the highest purity available. all
chemical reagents were obtained from sigma (st louis,
mo, usa).
 xxxd2586xxx  challenge
we tested  xxxd2586xxx  as a tracheal contraction drug.
preliminary tests showed a tracheal strip immersed in the
bath solution used for subsequent experiments did not contract when basal tension was applied. before drug assays
were conducted, isolated tracheas were equilibrated in the
bath solution for 15–30 min, during which continuous aeration with a mixture of 95% o2 and 5% co2 was applied.
stepwise increases in the amount of drugs used were
employed to study the contraction or relaxation responses
of the tracheal strips. all drugs were administered by adding a dewned volume of stock solution to the tissue bath
solution.
electrical weld stimulation challenge
electrical weld stimulation (efs) (5 hz, 5 ms pulse duration, at a voltage of 50 v, trains of stimulation for 5 s) was
applied to the trachea strip with two wire electrodes placed
parallel to the trachea strip and connected to a direct-current stimulator (grass s44, quincy, ma, usa). an interval
of 2 min was imposed between each stimulation period to
allow recovery from the response. stimulation was applied
contiguously to the trachea at 37°c.

statistical analysis
data of the basal tension and  xxxd2586xxx  experiment
were collected by the mean of tension between two diverent concentration agent was added.
in the efs experiment, data were the mean of the efs
peak between two diverent concentration agents added.
data are presented as mean § sd and statistical signiwcance was tested using a two-tailed student’s t test; p values less than 0.05 were considered signiwcant.

results
the pharmacological evects on tracheal contraction caused
by  xxxd2586xxx 
the degree of contraction or relaxation of tracheal strips
was estimated from the tension applied to the transducer.
tracheal contraction induced by a small dose of  xxxd2586xxx  was easily detected (not shown) and the tissue
remained in a contracted state until the drug was rinsed
from the tissue. this result was similar to our previous
description. adding the long-acting bronchodilator,  xxxd283xxx , on its own elicited a negligible response, but resulted
in further contraction of the trachea when introduced after
adding a constricting agent such as 10¡6 m  xxxd2586xxx 
(fig. 1). low doses of  xxxd283xxx  slightly relaxed the tracheal smooth muscle contracted by 10¡6 m  xxxd2586xxx ,
and higher doses caused further contractions occur more
rapidly.  xxxd1891xxx ¡8 m  xxxd283xxx , the tension was
99.6% § 3.4% of control values. while  xxxd1891xxx ¡5 and 10¡4 m
 xxxd283xxx , the tensions were 104.7% § 5.2% and
115.9% § 12.2%, respectively (fig. 2). compared with
10¡8 m  xxxd283xxx , the tension at a dose of 10¡5 m  xxxd283xxx  was increased slightly (fig. 2), and was enhanced
signiwcantly  xxxd1891xxx ¡4 m (p < 0.05). as far as terbutaline is
concerned, this short-acting bronchodilator relieved the tracheal smooth muscle (fig. 3). the higher the concentration
of terbutaline is, the lower the tension of the trachea

between 10¡8 m terbutaline and the concentration gradient of terbutaline from 10¡6 to 10¡3 m (p < 0.05 in 10¡6 m; p < 0.01 in 10¡5–10¡3
m). results were mean § sd (n = 7)

becomes. as the concentration of terbutaline increased
from 10¡6 to 10¡3 m, the tension was signiwcantly reduced
(p < 0.05 in 10¡6 m; p < 0.01 in 10¡5–10¡3 m; figs. 3, 4).

 xxxd283xxx  were 76.9 § 7.4% and 0%, respectively. compared with 10¡8 m  xxxd283xxx , the peak tension values of
the tracheal strip evoked by efs  xxxd1891xxx ¡5 and 10¡4 m  xxxd283xxx  addition were signiwcantly lower (p < 0.01; fig. 7).
similar experimental results were noted in terbutaline,
which signiwcantly inhibited the peak tension of the tracheal strip evoked by efs as the concentrations increased
from 10¡7 to 10¡3 m terbutaline (p < 0.05 in 10¡7 m;
p < 0.01 in 10¡6–10¡3 m). the peak tension upon adding
10¡8 m terbutaline was 90.9% § 3.1%; however, the stepwise increment in the concentration of terbutaline increased
from 10¡7 to 10¡3 m, the corresponding percents were
62.3 § 3.6%, 49.6 § 2.2%, 31.2 § 4.6%, 19.9 § 4.0% and
11.2 § 3.4%, respectively (fig. 8).

discussions

both  xxxd283xxx  and terbutaline also inhibited the spike
contraction induced by efs (figs. 5, 6). the peak tension
of the tracheal strip evoked by efs when adding 10¡8 m
 xxxd283xxx  was 96.7% § 1.5%, while 10¡5 and 10¡4 m

the results of our experiments should be interpreted within
the context of the test materials used. although it was diycult to determine which tissue component of the trachea
was responsible for drug-induced contraction, the nature of

increased from 10¡7 to 10¡3m terbutaline (p < 0.05 in 10¡7 m;
p < 0.01 in 10¡6–10¡3 m). results were mean § sd (n = 6)

the speciwc tissues and their responses to speciwc drugs
provide some indication. first, the tracheal strips used in
our study were crude preparations containing cartilage and
tracheal smooth muscle. the smooth muscle of the trachea
appeared to be the main tissue component responsible for
contraction as the other components (epithelium, glands,
connective tissue, nerves, and cartilage) did not contract to
a signiwcant extent.
because the method involved cross contraction,
changes in tension were caused by radial contraction of
the tracheal ring. responses to drugs and electrical
stimulation have been veriwed for similar preparations

[1, 4, 9–11]. however, the contractile response observed
was probably an aggregate of the responses of various
types of muscle tissue. second, the isolated tracheal
preparations used in our experiments were excised from
rats without damaging the endothelium or smooth muscle. it was therefore reasonable to assume the tracheal
responses to test agents in our study were comparable to
those observed after applying a spray to the trachea
during an asthma attack.
allergic rhinitis and asthma are inxammatory disorders
of the airway that often occur concomitantly. for otolaryngologists, patients with both conditions are common in

123

eur arch otorhinolaryngol (2010) 267:1305–1311

clinics because up to 40% of nasal allergic patients have or
will develop asthma. in fact, the who “allergic rhinitis
and its impact on asthma” (aria) guidelines clearly point
out that allergic rhinitis patients should be considered for
asthma [12]. for optimal eycacy, a combined strategy
should be used to treat both the upper and lower airways. if
a patient has allergic rhinitis and asthma, treatment should
also include  xxxd283xxx  or terbutaline to reduce bronchospasm.  xxxd283xxx  tablets contain the active ingredient  xxxd283xxx . once inside the body this ingredient is broken
down into terbutaline, which is a type of medicine known
as a short-acting 2-agonist. this allows the airways to
open.  xxxd283xxx  tablets are usually taken just before bedtime
and are evective for at least 24 h. they widen the airways,
enabling patients to breathe more easily.
according to recent recommendations, simultaneous
treatment with long-acting bronchodilators should be considered for patients with moderate to severe asthma [13].
regular use of short-acting inhaled 2-agonist bronchodilators may worsen asthma [14, 15]. managing asthma by the
inhaled route is superior to oral intake. the major advantages of delivering drugs directly into the lungs through inhalation are that higher concentrations can be delivered more
evectively to the airways and the systemic side evects are
lessened [14, 15]. moreover, by delivering drugs directly
into the target organ, a much more rapid evect is achieved.
 xxxd283xxx  and terbutaline are both 2-agonists for treating
asthma.  xxxd283xxx , a bis-dimethylcarbamate prodrug of
terbutaline, has no sympathomimetic activity [16]. it shows
unique, high lung distribution properties following oral
intake, and is slowly hydrolyzed to terbutaline in the lung
tissue [17–19]. in addition,  xxxd283xxx  strongly contributes
to its 24-h duration of action and has similar clinical
eycacy to other oral bronchodilators, but with less side
evects, especially with regard to tremoring [20]. however,
it may be given by the oral route if there is no inhaled form.
however, terbutaline is available in tablets or as an aerosol.
it is a short-acting bronchodilator usually taken three times
a day or inhaled to relieve acute symptoms and improve
lung function [5, 21, 22]. in this study, we chose the aerosol
of  xxxd283xxx , dissolved in water, for testing the evect on
isolated rat’s tracheal smooth muscle.
the cholinergic contracting agent tested in this preparation is commonly used for research purposes. the opposite
results in practicing both medicines were found in the present experiment. note that  xxxd283xxx -induced further contraction of tissue was followed before partial contraction of
smooth muscle using  xxxd2586xxx . thus, it is possible to
assay the evects of common drugs and potential adverse
evects supposedly responsible for worsening asthma. on
the contrary, the smooth muscle was relieved by terbutaline
which is understood to be a direct-acting 2-adrenergic
receptor agonist for relieving asthmatic symptoms.

1309

however,  xxxd283xxx , which is a non-bioactive 2-adrenergic receptor agonist, could enhance  xxxd2586xxx -induced
contraction [23]. it is reasonable to suppose that  xxxd283xxx 
given intratracheally may worsen shortness of breath.
the designed metabolic pathway from  xxxd283xxx  to
terbutaline is hydrolysis chiexy catalyzed by  xxxg248xxx  ( xxxg248xxx ), which is a kind of cholinesterase. acetylcholinesterase (ache), an enzyme mainly found at nerve
endings that breaks acetylcholine into acetyl and choline
fragments, is the other type of cholinesterase [18, 24–28].
table 1 shows the classiwcation of these two kinds of cholinesterase. inhibiting ache will activate the parasympathetic nervous system and in turn slow heart action,
lowering blood pressure, increasing secretion, and inducing
contraction of the smooth muscles [24, 25].  xxxd283xxx  has
high aynity with  xxxg248xxx  but not ache. this mechanism is
such that the toxicity related to the inhibition of ache was
considered unlikely with therapeutic use of the drug [18].
a signiwcant inhibition of  xxxg248xxx  by 10¡9 m  xxxd283xxx 
was demonstrated in human blood [18]. ache was much
less sensitive, a clear inhibition being observed  xxxd1891xxx ¡5 m.
this proved  xxxd283xxx  is an extremely potent and selective inhibitor of  xxxg248xxx . this wnding could explain why the
further tracheal smooth muscle contraction did not exert
signiwcantly until reaching a higher concentration of  xxxd283xxx  (surpassing 10¡5 m). because this was an in vitro
study, the possible mechanism by which this non-bioactive
2-agonist avected the trachea smooth muscle is only
theoretical and further studies are needed to clarify this
question.
 xxxd283xxx  is formulated as a hydrochloride salt in 10and 20-mg tablets, and once-daily ingestion in the evening
is recommended.  xxxd283xxx  is concentrated by lung tissue
after absorption from the gastrointestinal tract. the lung tissue can also absorb through the metabolic pathway from the
prodrug  xxxd283xxx  hydrolyzing to terbutaline [16, 23].
thus, it is logical to assume the concentration of  xxxd283xxx 
in lung tissue must be higher. according to this special
biological distribution, the possibility of bronchospasm
induced by a high concentration of  xxxd283xxx , such as drug
overdose, should be considered. our results appeared to
show that administering of  xxxd283xxx  intratracheally led to
bronchospasms induced by  xxxd2586xxx , and the evective
pharmacologic concentration should be at the point 10¡4 m
or more. there are very limited published data on the tissue
distribution of  xxxd283xxx  and its metabolites. using isolate
perfused guinea-pig lung tissue, ryrfeldt et al. demonstrated  xxxd283xxx  and its metabolites showed a sevenfold
higher concentration [20, 29] in lung compared with perfusate. the maximum plasma concentration (cmax) of  xxxd283xxx  after a single oral dose (270 g/kg) would reach
6.9 £ 10¡9 m in the in vivo study [23]. to our knowledge,
the peak concentration in lung tissue should be much

higher, especially in patients with a drug overdose. it is
unknown whether this concentration will reach the pharmacological activity for bronchospasm. because this was an in
vitro study, it has limitations as to the comparability with an
in vivo situation. the actual response might be much more
complicated than the in vitro situation.
electrical weld stimulation is a common experimental
tool activating the nerve terminals within the tissue to be
tested and inducing the release of endogenous neurotransmitters, thereby triggering the smooth muscle to contract.
efs-induced spike contraction of canine nasal mucosa,
which is believed to result from the contraction of vascular
smooth muscles, disappeared after ipsilateral cervical sympathetic ganglionectomy [20]. thus, efs-induced spike
contraction of isolated canine nasal mucosa was proved to
be mediated by sympathetic innervation [30]. in this study,
efs-induced spike contraction of the tracheal smooth muscle was believed to be from the stimulation of parasympathetic innervation. therefore, efs-induced contraction of
the trachea decreased as the  xxxd283xxx  or terbutaline concentration increased. these wndings suggest that 2-agonist
and its prodrug could antagonize the parasympathetic innervation responsible for trachea smooth muscle contraction.
another signiwcant wnding is that the experimental
responses for  xxxd2586xxx  and the efs were contrary to
each other in the study administering  xxxd283xxx .  xxxd283xxx  had a cholinergic evect in the  xxxd2586xxx  experiment and caused a further contraction in the contracted
tracheal smooth muscle induced by  xxxd2586xxx , which is
supposed to worsen asthma. on the contrary,  xxxd283xxx 
inhibited efs-induced spike contraction of the trachea.
this wnding explained why  xxxd283xxx  played a role in the
anti-parasympathetic response, and it seemed to relieve
asthmatic symptoms. clearly, while what was observed in
this study is interesting, further research is needed to clarify
these phenomena.

123

conclusion
our data set described that terbutaline had an anti-cholinergic
evect that could relieve asthmatic symptoms.  xxxd283xxx 
given intratracheally could enhance  xxxd2586xxx -induced
contraction of the trachea, but decrease efs-induced contraction as the  xxxd283xxx  concentration increased. the
evect of  xxxd283xxx  acting on tracheal smooth muscle
directly was controversial.
