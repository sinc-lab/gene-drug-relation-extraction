the purpose of this study was to determine the effects of copper deficiency on key aspects of homocysteine metabolism
that involve methionine recycling and transsulfuration. male weanling sprague-dawley rats were fed ain-93g-based diets
containing ,1 or ;6 mg cu/kg. after 6 wk (expt. 1) and 4 wk (expt. 2) we found that plasma homocysteine was significantly decreased, and plasma glutathione significantly increased, in rats fed the low-cu diet. real-time rt-pcr was used
to determine the expression of the subunits of glutamate-cysteine ligase (gcl) in liver that catalyzes the rate-limiting step in
glutathione biosynthesis. the expression of  xxxg877xxx , the catalytic subunit of gcl, was upregulated by cu deficiency;  xxxg878xxx , the
modifier subunit, was not affected. hepatic betaine-homocysteine methyltransferase ( xxxg262xxx ), which catalyzes one of the
two ways that homocysteine can be remethylated to methionine, was downregulated by cu deficiency. because cu
deficiency results in upregulation of  xxxg877xxx  and an increase in the biosynthesis of glutathione, it is plausible that the net flux
of homocysteine through the transsulfuration pathway is increased. furthermore, if  xxxg262xxx  is downregulated, less homocysteine is available for remethylation (methionine recycling) and more is then available to irreversibly enter the transsulfuration pathway where it is lost. the net effect of increased  xxxg877xxx  and decreased  xxxg262xxx  would be a decrease in
homocysteine as a result of cu deficiency. j. nutr. 137: 1370–1374, 2007.

introduction
copper (cu) deficiency has long been recognized as targeting the
cardiovascular system (1). however, the exact mechanism(s) of
cardiac or cardiovascular involvement in cu deficiency remains
to be clearly identified (2). over the years, research with laboratory animals has shown that cu deficiency can result in cardiac defects (including changes in heart morphology and cardiac
function), circulatory defects (including blood vessel morphology,
angiogenesis, and circulatory function), and systemic defects (including changes in blood pressure and anemia) [for review see (1)].
hyperhomocysteinemia is now regarded as a risk factor for
cardiovascular disease (3). brown and strain (4) found that feeding rats supplemental dl-homocysteine lowered indices of cu
status; this occurred regardless of dietary cu (adequate or deficient). however, until the work of tamura et al. (5), nothing
was known about the interaction between cu deficiency and
plasma concentrations of homocysteine; they reported that plasma
homocysteine was elevated in cu-deficient rats. furthermore,
cu deficiency in rats results in increased plasma and liver glu1

 xxxd2213xxx  (6). the increase in glutathione by cu deficiency is most
likely the result of an upregulation of  xxxd1388xxx  synthetase [glutamate-cysteine ligase (gcl)5], the rate-limiting
enzyme for glutathione biosynthesis (6). work by tamura
et al. (5) suggested that homocysteine is increased as a result of
decreased activity of  xxxg1479xxx  (mtr) in cu-deficient
rats. contrary to the work of tamura et al. (5), unpublished
results from our laboratory indicate that plasma homocysteine
is decreased, not increased, by cu deficiency. because of the
well-known association that both homocysteine and cu have
with cardiovascular disease, it is important to understand any
interaction between the two.
our initial experiment was designed to determine the differences seen in cu metabolism when the ain-93 diet was compared with the ain-76a diet (7). reformulation of the ain-76a
diet included lowering the mn concentration from 50 mg/kg to
10 mg/kg and changing the sulfur amino acid (saa) supplement
from dl-methionine (dl-met) to l-cystine ( xxxd1788xxx ). work by kato
et al. (8) and nielsen (9) suggested that dietary cystine facilitates
indirect defects of cu deficiency by impairing the mobilization of
fe from the liver. lowering the dietary mn from 50 to 10 mg/kg
diet might enhance fe absorption thereby affecting signs of cu
deficiency (7). also, an interaction between cu and mn exists
that could affect cu utilization (10,11). thus, our experiment

abstract

was designed to determine whether dietary fe, mn, and/or
saa interactions might influence the effect of cu deficiency on
plasma homocysteine. because our results were contrary to the
published results of tamura et al. (5), who reported that cu
deficiency increases plasma homocysteine, we did not include
our results on homocysteine in our report of the consequences on
cu as a result of alterations in the ain-93 diet. therefore, the
purpose of this research was to verify that cu deficiency lowers,
not increases, plasma homocysteine, and to determine the effect
of cu deficiency on the mrna expression of genes involved in
homocysteine metabolism to determine the mechanism of action
of cu on homocysteine concentrations.

animals and diets
experiment 1. the experimental design is mentioned above and has
already been published (7). to summarize, weanling male spraguedawley rats (n ¼ 8) were fed diets based on the ain-93g diet (12). the
experimental design was a 2 3 2 3 2 3 2 factorial in which the dietary
variables were cu, ,1 or 6 mg/kg; fe, 10 or 35 mg/kg; mn, 10 or 50
mg/kg, and saa as either dl-met or  xxxd1788xxx , each at 3 g/kg. the diets contained 200 g casein/kg. thus, the  xxxd1788xxx –supplemented diets contained
(by calculation) 3.5 g cystine and 4.6 g methionine/kg; the dl-metsupplemented diets contained 0.5 g cystine and 7.6 g methionine/kg. rats
were fed the diets for 6 wk and then, without fasting, were anesthetized
with a 1.37:1 mixture of ketamine:xylazine (1 ml/kg body wt, i.p.)
(ketamine hcl, fort dodge animal health; xylazine, phoenix scientific). blood was withdrawn from the abdominal aorta into tubes containing edta (30 ml of 121 mmol/l edta, dina, ph 7.4, per ml
whole blood) and centrifuged  xxxd1891xxx ,000 3 g at 4c within 30 min.
experiment 2. male weanling sprague-dawley rats (n ¼ 8) were fed
ain-93g-based diets (12) with cu as the dietary variable (,1 or 6 mg/
kg). after 4 wk unfasted rats were anesthetized with fluorescene. edtablood was collected and centrifuged  xxxd1891xxx ,000 3 g at 4c within 30 min.
the analyzed cu concentrations of the diets were 0.30 6 0.01 mg/kg for
the ,1 mg/kg cu diet and 6.38 6 0.11 mg/kg for the 6 mg/kg cu diet. cu
was supplemented as cuso4  5h2o.
all procedures were approved by the animal care and use committee of the usda agricultural research service, grand forks human
nutrition research center; the study was in accordance with the guidelines of the nih on experimental use of laboratory animals (13).
cu status indices
plasma  xxxg500xxx  activity, cu content of the diets, and liver cu and
fe concentrations were determined as reported (7).
liver sam and sah
liver was homogenized in cold 0.4 mol/l perchloric acid and prepared
for s- xxxd3156xxx  (sam) and s- xxxd3157xxx  (sah) analysis according to davis et al. (14) and measured with a dionex 4000i
hplc (dionex) according to the procedure of wagner et al. (15).
plasma homocysteine, glutathione, and cysteine
total (reduced plus oxidized) homocysteine, total glutathione, and cysteine were determined in edta plasma using hplc according to the
procedure of durand et al. (16).
real time rt-pcr
during the animal kill a piece of liver was quickly excised and placed in
rnalater (ambion) and then stored at 220c until rna extraction.
total rna was extracted using the nucleospin rna ii kit (bd biosciences). the primers used for the different genes were:  xxxg262xxx  (betainehomocysteine methyltransferase, nm_030850), f: 5#-ggg aac tac

statistics
data from expt. 1 were analyzed by 4-way anova using the statistical
package sas, version 9.1 (sas institute) in which the main effects and
interactions were computed. the t test (excel, microsoft) was used for
data from experiment 2. for the real-time rt-pcr data, the t test compared dct. however, fold change (2t2ddc) is reported in the text. all
values are reported as means 6 se or, for fold change, means are expressed as (21 se, 11 se). differences were considered significant at
p # 0.05.

results
data on cu status indices for expt. 1 have been reported (7). cudeficient rats over a range of fe, mn, and saa intakes, have decreased concentrations of plasma homocysteine compared with
rats fed adequate copper (table 1, p , 0.0008). only in cudeficient rats, fed 35 mg/kg zn, 50 mg/kg mn, and  xxxd1788xxx , was
plasma homocysteine higher than in rats fed the same diet but
supplemented with cu. of the other dietary variables, only fe
significantly affected plasma homocysteine (table 1). rats fed
low dietary fe (10 mg/kg) had reduced plasma homocysteine
than those fed 35 mg fe/kg.
dietary cu had no direct effect on the concentration of hepatic
sam (table 1). liver sah was slightly (p ¼ 0.023) elevated by
cu deficiency. hepatic sah was increased, and the sam:sah
ratio decreased, in rats fed diets containing 10 mg fe/kg.
because the main objective of this research was to determine
the effect of cu on homocysteine and homocysteine metabolism,
we included the results when all dietary treatment groups (fe,
mn, and ssa) other than cu were pooled (table 2). compared

real time rt-pcr was done using the quantitect sybr green rtpcr kit (qiagen) and a smartcycler (cepheid) instrument. gene expression was quantified using the comparative ct method (17). ct, the
threshold cycle, is the number of cycles it takes for a sample to reach the
level where the rate of amplification is greatest during the exponential
phase. dct was obtained for each sample or gene by the following calculation: dct ¼ ct,x – ct,r where ct,x ¼ threshold number for the
target gene amplification and ct,r ¼ threshold number for the reference
gene [b-actin ( xxxg53xxx )] amplification. for the comparative ct method to
be valid, replication efficiencies (slope of the calibration curves) of the
target gene and that of the reference gene must be approximately equal.
for the primers used, replication efficiencies were equal to the efficiency
of the reference amplification ( xxxg53xxx ) (data not shown).
the amount of target, normalized to an endogenous reference ( xxxg53xxx )
and relative to the control group (rats fed 6 mg cu/kg), is given by the
formula 2t2ddc; ddct ¼ dct, xxxd1738xxx  dct,cb where dct,q ¼ dct for an
individual sample and dct,cb ¼ mean dct for control group. thus, the
value of 2t2ddc for the amount of target in the control group was ¼ 1.
for the amount of target in the animals fed ,1 cu mg/kg, a 1-fold
change indicates no change, .1-fold change indicates upregulation, and
,1-fold change indicates downregulation.

with rats fed 6 mg cu/kg, cu deficiency resulted in ;20%
reduction in plasma homocysteine.
the cu-status indicators show that the rats from experiment 2
fed the low-cu diet were cu deficient (table 3).plasma  xxxg500xxx  activity and liver cu were markedly depressed (p ,
0.0001), and liver fe elevated (p , 0.001), by cu deficiency.
plasma homocysteine, but not cysteine, was decreased by cu
deficiency (table 4). plasma glutathione was increased in rats fed
the cu deficient diet.
expression of genes related to homocysteine metabolism was
determined by real time rt-pcr. of 8 genes studied, only  xxxg877xxx 
and  xxxg262xxx  were affected by cu.  xxxg877xxx  was upregulated [2.86-fold
increase (1.78, 4.59)] in the cu-deficient rats compared with
the cu-adequate controls (p , 0.04).  xxxg262xxx  was downregulated
[0.48-fold decrease (0.36, 0.65)] in liver of rats fed the cudeficient diet compared with controls fed 6 mg cu/kg (p , 0.024).

discussion
copper status indicators of experiment 1 have been published
(7). for example, the activity of serum  xxxg500xxx  was reduced (p , 0.001) in cu deficiency to only ;5% of the control
values. plasma and liver cu concentrations and plasma homocysteine were markedly reduced, and liver fe markedly increased,
by cu deficiency. the decrease in plasma homocysteine due to
cu deficiency occurred under a variety of dietary conditions including altered fe, mn, and saa. however, the scope of the present research was only to determine the effect of cu deficiency on
homocysteine. therefore, we pooled dietary groups to show the
overall effect of cu (table 2). because these results contradicted
findings of tamura et al. (5), our second experiment included
efforts to not only study the effect of cu on the concentration of
homocysteine in plasma, but to study the effects of cu on the
metabolism of homocysteine as well.

experiment 2 confirmed that cu deficiency resulted in a significantly decreased concentration of plasma homocysteine. further,
we showed that plasma glutathione is increased in cu deficiency.
cu deficiency in rats increases plasma and hepatic glutathione
(18). to determine why cu deficiency increases glutathione
concentrations, chen et al. (6) studied the activity and mrna
expression of hepatic  xxxd1388xxx  synthetase (glutamatecysteine ligase, gcl). they found that the activity of gcl and the
relative amount of gcl mrna were significantly increased by cu
deficiency. because this enzyme catalyzes the rate limiting step of
glutathione synthesis, their work provided a mechanism for
increased glutathione in cu-deficient animals. our work verified
that cu deficiency results in upregulation of gcl mrna. we also
found that cu deficiency upregulates  xxxg877xxx  mrna, the catalytic
subunit of gcl, but we did not find an effect of cu on  xxxg878xxx 
mrna, the modifier subunit of gcl. of other genes involved in
homocysteine metabolism that we selected to analyze for expression, only  xxxg262xxx  was affected by cu deficiency.  xxxg262xxx  mrna was
significantly downregulated in the cu-deficient rat liver. the enzyme expressed by  xxxg262xxx  is important for remethylation of homocysteine to methionine, deriving the methyl group from betaine.
the other enzyme that remethylates homocysteine to methionine
is the folate-dependent  xxxg1479xxx  (mtr). tamura et al.
(5) found that the activity of hepatic mtr was decreased by cu
deficiency. we found no effect of cu on the expression of mtr
(mrna).
although cu deficiency resulted in a slight increase (;5%) in
liver sah (table 2), it was significant. sah is hydrolyzed to
form homocysteine and adenosine by the gene product (sah
hyrdolase) of  xxxg104xxx . however, because of the thermodynamics of
the sah hydrolase reaction, sah concentrations usually reflect
the tissue concentration of homocysteine (19). furthermore, sah
hydrolase is reported to be a cu-binding protein (20). however,
we found that dietary cu had no effect on the expression of  xxxg104xxx 
mrna. also, tamura et al. (5) stated ‘‘our preliminary results
of the determination of the activities of sah hydrolase in the
liver and  xxxd187xxx  of the rats used in the study presented here
indicate that sah hydrolase activities were not decreased in
copper-deficient rats.’’ we also found no effect of cu on sam or
sam:sah ratio. thus, it was not unexpected that we found no
effect of cu on  xxxg928xxx  mrna, the gene product of which plays an
important role in regulating tissue sam and sah and therefore
sam:sah ratio (21,22).
cu deficiency results in upregulation of  xxxg877xxx  mrna and an
increase in the biosynthesis of glutathione. mosharov et al. (23)
suggest that about half of the intracellular glutathione pool in
human liver cells is derived from homocysteine. thus, it is not
unreasonable to suggest that upregulation of  xxxg877xxx  results in decreased homocysteine in cu-deprived rats. furthermore, if  xxxg262xxx 
is downregulated, less homocysteine is available for remethyla-

tion (methionine recycling) and more is then available to irreversibly enter the transsulfuration pathway where it is lost.
hyperhomocysteinemia is now regarded as a risk factor for
atherosclerosis (24). therefore, it is important to know how
dietary factors can affect its metabolism and ultimate concentration. tamura et al. (5) found that plasma homocysteine was
increased by cu deficiency. we had opposite findings, that cu
deficiency results in a decreased concentration of plasma homocysteine. this does not suggest that the effect of copper deficiency on homocysteine is beneficial. our results suggest that an
impairment in metabolism as a result of copper deficiency results
in the lowering of homocysteine to below normal steady-state
concentrations. the decrease in homocysteine may actually be detrimental, in that dudman (25) suggested that homocysteine may
be needed for recruitment of leucocytes at sites of tissue damage.
our results occurred in studies with overtly cu-deficient rats;
the impact in laboratory animals and humans of marginal deficiency of cu on homocysteine is not known. overt copper
deficiency does not occur in humans. however, milne reported
that .30% of 849 diets sampled from north america and
europe provided ,1.0 mg cu/d, the approximate amount of cu
found to be insufficient in some short-term cu-depletion studies
in humans (26).
we have no explanation for the differences between our findings
and those of tamura et al. (5). however, they could be the result
of differences in diets or age of animals at the onset of the experiments. both groups used male sprague-dawley rats. we
used weanling rats (;40 g) but tamura used older rats of ;90 g.
both groups used approximately the same time (our studies were
6 and 4 wk; tamura et al. used 6 wk). the main difference was
the diets used. we used the 20% casein-based ain-93 diet (12)
but tamura et al. (5) used a 21% egg-white based diet. this would
mean (based on calculated values) that the molar ratio (expressed either as cystine:methionine or methionine:cystine) were
significantly different between the studies (regardless of methionine or cystine supplementation in our first experiment). other
amino acid differences included more glycine and serine in the
egg white diets. all of these amino acids can impact methionine
and hence homocysteine metabolism (27–29). also, fields et al.
(30) showed that the type of dietary protein can affect signs of
cu deficiency.
finally, the effect of cu deficiency on glutathione, homocysteine, and  xxxg877xxx  mrna parallels that of selenium deficiency in
rats. in a selenium-deficient rat, there is low plasma (and tissue)
homocysteine, increased glutathione (hepatic and plasma) (31),
decreased activity and expression of  xxxg262xxx  (32), and upregulation of gcl (33). both cu and selenium are involved in oxidative
defense, whether mechanisms resulting in similar outcomes
related to homocysteine and homocysteine metabolism are the
same, is unknown.
