we have examined the effect of addition of  xxxd2300xxx  to growth medium
on the activity of the adenosylcobalamin-requiring enzyme methylmalonyl coa
mutase in normal human fibroblasts and in mutant human fibroblasts derived
from patients with inherited methylmalonicacidemia. the mutant cell lines were
assigned to four distinct genetic co!nplementation groups (cbl a, cbl b, cbl c,
and cbl d ) , each deficient in some step in the synthesis of adenosylcobalamin
from  xxxd2300xxx . "after control cells were grown in cobalamin-supplemented medium, mutase holoenzyme activity increased markedly in a time- and
concentration-dependent fashion. growth in cobalamin-supplemented medium
had no effect on mutase activity in some mutant lines belonging to the cbl b
group, while activity increased severalfold in other cbl b mutants and in all cbl a,
cbl c, and cbl d mutants examined, although mutase activity was still < 10%oof
control. comparison of mutase holoenzyme activity and total propionate pathway activity suggests that enhancement of mutase activity in mutant cells after
cobalamin supplementation to values 5-10°//o of control may be sufficient to
overcome the inherited metabolic block and to restore total pathway activity to
normal.

introduction
inherited deficiencies of methylmalonyl coa mutase activity (methylmalonyl
coa coa-carbonyl mutase, e.c. 5.4.99.2) in man can be due to structural
alterations in the mutase apoenzyme (willard and rosenberg, 1977) or to any
of four genetically distinct (willard et al., 1978) defects in the synthesis of
adenosylcobalamin (adocbl), the coenzyme required by mutase to catalyze
the rearrangement of l-methylmalonyl coa to succinyl coa. the cardinal
chemical feature of these genetic disorders is the increased amount of methylmalonate present in both serum and urine of affected patients (rosenberg,
1978). some patients with inherited methylmalonicacidemia and aciduria
have demonstrated a marked decrease in methylmalonate concentrations
following administration of pharmacological doses of vitamin b12 (cobala-~
min, cbl), the precursor ofadocbl (rosenberg, 1978). the methylmalonicacidemia in such patients was therefore originally termed "b12 dependent"
or "b12 responsive" (rosenberg et al., 1968). consequently, patients with
methylmalonicacidemia have been characterized clinically as "responsive"
or "unrespofisive," depending on whether or not their urinary methylmalonate excretion fell after cbl therapy (morrow et al., 1975).
to some degree, this clinical heterogeneity can be accounted for by
genetic distinctions; that is, patients with one of the known inborn errors of
cbl metabolism (designated cbl a, cbl b, cbl c, and cbl d) have generally
(rosenberg et al., 1968; morrow etal., 1975; rosenberg, 1976) but not always
(kaye et al., 1974) been "responsive" clinically, while patients exhibiting
defects in the mutase apoenzyme (designated  xxxg1485xxx ) have been "unresponsive"
(morrow et al., 1969a; wilcken et al., 1977).
in efforts to define further the basis for these clinical phenomena, studies
using cultured skin fibroblasts have established that when cells derived from
patients with methylmalonicacidemia are grown in tissue culture medium
containing high concentrations of supplementary cbl, some mutant lines
exhibit increases in intracellular adocbl content and in propionate pathway
activity while others do not (rosenberg et al., 1969; mudd et al., 1970; linnell
et al., 1976; willard and rosenberg, 1977). the exact nature and significance
of these findings with respect to activity of methylmalonyl coa mutase are not
as yet clear, however.
the present study was therefore initiated to examine the effect of addition
of cbl to the tissue culture medium on methylmalonyl coa mutase activity in
control fibroblasts and in mutant cell lines belonging to the four complementation groups with a defect in adocbl synthesis. in this report, we describe
significant differences among cell lines with respect to their behavior in
cbl-supplemented medium and demonstrate that this variation reflects both
intraclass and interclass heterogeneity within and among the mutant comple-

inborn errorsof cobalamin metabolism

mentation groups. we present evidence that cbl may play a critical and
complex role in modulating mutase activity in both control and mutant cells
and, further, that mutase may serve as the rate-limiting step in propionate
metabolism in some mutant cells only under conditions of relative cbl
depletion.
materials and methods
cells and growth conditions

human skin fibroblasts were routinely maintained as described (mahoney et
al., 1975) in dulbecco's modified eagle's minimal essential medium, supplemented with 1% nonessential amino acids, with 100/~g/ml kanamycin, and
with either 10% fetal bovine serum (flow) or 10% dialyzed fetal calf serum
(gibco). this growth medium will be referred to as "basal medium" and
contained 30-50 pg cbl/ml. to prepare cbl-supplemented medium,  xxxd2300xxx  ( xxxd2300xxx ) ( xxxd2300xxx ; merck, sharp and dohme) was added
directly to basal medium at the appropriate concentrations. in some experiments, cells were maintained in either basal or cbl-supplemented medium
containing 10% human serum; no significant differences were noted among
cells grown in the different sera with respect either to propionate utilization or
to methylmalonyl coa mutase activity.
cell lines were derived from four normal individuals and from 22 patients
with methylmalonicacidemia due to an inherited defect in cbl metabolism.
cell lines had been in culture for 3-28 passages at the time of study. lines were
periodically tested for mycoplasma contamination after growth in antibioticfree medium; all tests performed either in our laboratory or at the institute for
medical research, camden, n.j., were negative.
classification of mutant cell lines

mutant cell lines were assigned to four mutant classes (cbl a, cbl b, cbl c, and
cbl d) on the basis of both genetic and biochemical criteria, including complementation analysis (gravel et al., 1975; willard et al., 1978), measurement of
cbl coenzyme synthesis in whole cells (willard et al., 1978), and assays of
methylmalonyl coa mutase activity (willard and rosenberg, 1977),
ns-methyltetrahydrofolate:homocysteine methyltransferase activity (e.c.
2.1.1.13) (mellman et al., 1978), and atp :  xxxd1771xxx  cofl-adenosyltransferase activity (e.c. 2.5.1.17) (mahoney et al., 1975) in cell extracts. of the 22
cell lines examined (t~ible i), three (lines 283, 331, and 337) were classified on
the basis of biochemical characterization alone; the other 19 lines were
classified by both complementation analysis and biochemical criteria.

including methylmalonyl coa mutase. assays were performed 2-5 days after
a split into plastic tissue culture flasks.
assay of methylmalonyl coa mutase activity

methylmalonyl coa mutase activity was measured in cell extracts as described (willard and rosenberg, 1977) and is expressed as pmol succinate
formed/min/mg protein. the lower limit of detectability in these experiments
was 4 pmol/min/mg. protein concentration was estimated by the method of
b6hlen et al. (1973). cells were always harvested and assayed 4 days after a
1:4 split into plastic tissue culture flasks. cell extracts were prepared and
assayed in the dark (willard and rosenberg, 1977), although enzyme activity
was unaffected by light conditions during cell growth prior to harvest (unpublished observations). in some experiments, extracts were subjected to gel
filtration prior to assay. sephadex g-25 columns (0.9 by 30 cm) were equilibrated with 0.2 m tris-sulfate, ph 7.5, containing 0.1% lubrol-wx. cell
extracts containing 2-4 mg protein were loaded and the columns eluted at 4° c
with the above buffer. fractions were monitored for absorbance at 280 nm;
the protein-containing fractions were pooled and assayed for mutase activity.
all operations involving unbound cbl were performed in the dark.
methylmalonyl coa mutase exists in cells both complexed with adocbl
(mutase holoenzyme) and free of adocbl (mutase apoenzyme). holoenzyme
activity was estimated by omitting adocbl from the reaction mixture. total
enzyme activity (holoenzyme plus apoenzyme) was estimated by adding
5 × 10- ~ madocbl to the reaction mixture. assays of both total enzyme and
holoenzyme activities were linear for at least 7 min.
results
propionate fixation by intact cells in basal medium

when grown in basal tissue culture medium containing 30-50 pg cbl/ml, each
of the 22 mutant cell lines was deficient in the ability to incorporate 14c from
[l-14c]propionate into acid-precipitable material (table i), fixing 0.06-1.62
natom x4c/mg protein. under the same conditions, four control lines fixed
2.97-22.25 natom 14c/mg (mean 8.20 natom 14c/mg, n = 109).
propionate fixation by intact cells in cbl-supplemented medium

to determine the effect of cbl supplementation on propionate pathway
activity in intact cells, various concentrations of  xxxd2300xxx  were added to the
basal medium and 14c fixation measured 2-5 days later. data from representative control and mutant lines are presented in fig. i; the data for all mutant

lines studied are shown in table i. as noted in fig. 1, [l-14c]propionate
fixation by control lines did not increase significantly or reproducibly even
when the cbl concentration in the medium was raised over 20,000-fold, to 1/~g
 xxxd2300xxx /ml. for all four control lines, 14c fixation increased by as much as
30~ in some experiments; in other experiments, no such increase was
observed.
for the mutant cell lines, on the other hand, characteristic patterns of
stimulation were consistently noted in three of the four mutant classes--cbl a,
cbl c, and cbl d. levels of 14c fixation by each of eight cbl a mutants
examined, for example, increased one- to sevenfold when grown in 1 pg
 xxxd2300xxx /ml, the highest values reaching the lower limit of the control range
(table i, fig. 1). this enhancement was concentration dependent, and significant increases in 14c fixation were always noted at  xxxd2300xxx  concentrations in
the medium as low as 0.001 #g/ml (data not shown).
consistent effects could also be demonstrated in the cbl c and cbl d
complementation groups. in the four cbl c cell lines studied, ~4c fixation
increased maximally well into the control range (fig. 1), although the concentration dependence of this enhancement varied considerably among the four
lines (table i). the two cbl d lines, derived from siblings, exhibited the highest

levels of 14c fixation observed in mutant lines under basal conditions and
behaved similarly to cbl c lines in  xxxd2300xxx -supplemented medium (table i).
in contrast to the apparently universal stimulation observed in cbl a, cbl
c, and cbl d mutants, the cbl b complementation group demonstrated a great
deal of intraclass heterogeneity. three of the eight cbl b lines examined (lines
215, 487, and 563) had higher values for 14c fixation under basal conditions
than did the others and reacted to cbl supplementation with a seven- to
ninefold increase in 14c fixation (table i, fig. 1). of five other lines studied,
however, three (lines209, 224, and 311) were completely refractory to cbl
supplementation after 2-5 days, and two (lines 283 and 500) exhibited only
small increases in 14c fixation at 1/~g  xxxd2300xxx /ml.
to assess the possibility that the differences among and within the four
mutant classes reflected variation in the kinetics rather than in the magnitude
of an increase in a4c fixation, we grew cells for up to 30 days in medium
containing 0.01-1.0 #g  xxxd2300xxx /ml. in control cells, ~4c fixation was no
higher when measured after 30 days in cbl-supplemented medium than when
measured under basal conditions. in mutant cells, when ~4c fixation was
measured after extended growth in cbl-supplemented medium, the results
were qualitatively the same as those seen at 2-5 days (fig. 2). for example, in
one of the cbl b mutants (line 215), an increase in ~4c fixation was detectable
as early as 10 hr after addition of  xxxd2300xxx  to the medium. the increase was
maximal after 5 days of growth in medium containing 1 #g  xxxd2300xxx /ml, and
no further enhancement was observed at longer times. at 0.1 #g  xxxd2300xxx /ml,
the increase in ~4c fixation in line 215 was not as great as that seen at 1/tg/ml
at times up to 5 days (fig. 2, table i), but the increase converged with that at 1
~g  xxxd2300xxx /ml at longer times. at 0.01 #g  xxxd2300xxx /ml (i.e., 200 times the cbl
concentration found in basal medium), levels of 14c fixation were, as
expected, intermediate between those obtained under basal growth conditions
and those obtained at 0.1 pg  xxxd2300xxx /ml. when a different cbl b mutant (line
209) was grown in cbl-supplemented medium, ~4c fixation remained completely refractory even after prolonged growth at 1 pg  xxxd2300xxx /ml (fig. 2).
the kinetics of the enhancement in cbl a, cbl c, and cbl d cells were
similar to those described in fig. 2 for line 215 (unpublished observations).
values for ~4c fixation did not increase above those shown in table i despite
prolonged growth in cbl-supplemented medium. increases after growth in 0.1
#g  xxxd2300xxx /ml characteristically plateaued at levels comparable to those seen
at 1 #g  xxxd2300xxx /ml; and at 0.01 #g  xxxd2300xxx /ml, fixation plateaued at lower
levels in each mutant cell line examined. this effect was most marked in cbl c
and cbld cells, in which a4c fixation at 0.01 #g  xxxd2300xxx /ml plateaued at levels
20-30~ of those reached at 0.1 or 1 /ag  xxxd2300xxx /ml. in all cases, maximal
stimulation was observed 2-5 days after addition of supplementary  xxxd2300xxx ,
after which time a4c fixation decreased slightly (fig. 2) before plateauing.

days in  xxxd2300xxx  (i/zg/ml)
fig. 3. methylmalonyl coa mutase activity assayed in
extracts of control cells after growth in cbl-supplemented medium. a: cells were grown in medium supplemented with various concentrations of  xxxd2300xxx , and
holomutase activity was measured 4 days later. b: cells
were grown in medium containing 1/~g  xxxd2300xxx /ml and
mutase "ho]oenzyme and total enzyme activities were
measured after various periods of time. cultures were
always spht 4 days before assay. data are shown from
experiments with one cell line. similar data exist for two
other control cell lines.

grown in medium containing as little as 0.001 #g  xxxd2300xxx /ml and was
enhanced greater than twentyfold to 1000-1100 pmol/min/mg after growth in
medium containing 0.1 #g  xxxd2300xxx /ml. under these conditions, 50% of total
enzyme activity existed as holoenzyme. no further increase in holomutase
activity or in the percentage of holoenzyme was observed at concentrations
between 0.1 and 50 #g  xxxd2300xxx /ml.
since extracts prepared from cells grown in cbl-supplemented medium
contain significant amounts of adocbl (linnell et al., 1976), we considered
the possibility that the enhanced holomutase activities might be influenced to
some degree by the presence of unbound adocbl in the final reaction mixture

68

and might not, therefore, strictly reflect endogenous holoenzyme formed in
the cells in culture. control cells were grown in medium containing 1 #g
 xxxd2300xxx /ml and mutase activity was measured 4 days later, both before and
after gel filtration of the cell extract. neither total mutase or holomutase
activity was affected by gel filtration; both before and after removal of
unbound cbl, holomutase activity accounted for 50~ of the total enzyme
activity. we conclude, therefore, that our measurements of holomutase activity represent holoenzyme formed intracellularly during cbl supplementation.
the time dependence of this reponse was examined by measuring both
total mutase and holomutase activities at various times after growth in
medium supplemented with 1 pg  xxxd2300xxx /ml (fig. 3b). both total enzyme and
holoenzyme levels increased sharply within the first 24 hr. over the same time
span, the percentage of total enzyme activity which existed as holoenzyme
went from 1-10~ under basal conditions to 35-40~ under supplemented
conditions in the three control lines examined in this fashion. both total
mutase and holomutase activities continued to respond to cbl supplementation for at least 30 days in this experiment (fig. 3b), although the rate of
increase decreased after 24 hr. the percentage of holoenzyme remained
strikingly constant at approximately 50~ after growth in cbl-supplemented
medium for more than 4 days.
to elucidate the nature of the increase in x4c fixation observed in some
mutant lines after cbl supplementation (fig. 1, table i), we measured holomutase activity in extracts of representative cbl a, cbl b, cbl c, and cbl d cell
lines after growth in medium containing 1 #g  xxxd2300xxx /ml. when grown for 4
days in medium containing 1 ktg  xxxd2300xxx /ml (after which time the increase in
14c fixation was maximal), some cell lines exhibited significant effects, holomutase activity increasing to values near (cbl a mutants) or well into (cbl c
and cbl d mutants, and cbl b mutant 215) the control range under basal
conditions (table iii). a cbl b mutant whose values for 14c fixation were
slightly enhanced by growth in cbl-supplemented medium (line 500) showed a
smaller increase in holomutase activity, while cbl b mutant 209 was completely refractory to cbl supplementation, whether activity was measured in
intact cells in situ or in cell extracts (table iii). compared to control cell lines
grown under the same cbl-supplemented conditions, however, mutant cell
lines were still severely deficient in holomutase activity, their activities ranging
from < 1 to 8~ of the mean control value (table iii). as shown above for
control lines, measurement of holomutase activity in mutant cells grown in
cbl-supplemented medium was unaffected by gel filtration of the cell extract
prior to assay.
since values for 14c fixation in the control range did not correlate with
holomutase activity (compare figs. 1 and 3; see below), the possibility existed

inborn errors of cobalamin m e t a b o l i s m

69

that mutase activity might continue to increase in some mutant lines after
prolonged growth in cbl-supplemented medium, even though the maximum
increase in ~4c fixation had been observed after 4 or 5 days (e.g., cbl c and cbl
d cells in fig. 1). to investigate this, we measured holomutase activity in cbl
c, cbl d, and control cell extracts after growth for up to 17 days in medium
containing 1 #g  xxxd2300xxx /ml. as shown in fig. 4, no further increase in
holomutase activity was observed after 4 days in these mutant cells.

comparison of propionate fixation and methylmalonyl coa mutase
holoenzyme activity
to assess the extent to which measurements of propionate fixation in intact
cells are a valid reflection of the methylmalonyi coa mutase activity endogenous to those cells, we compared the two sets of data for control and mutant
cell lines in which both holomutase activity and 14c fixation had been
measured (tables i, ii, and iii). over a narrow range of holomutase activity
between 4 and 18 pmol/min/mg, corresponding to values for ~4c fixation
between 0.50 and 2.50 natom 14c/mg, the two parameters were related with a
correlation coefficient of r = + 0.9. below this range, holomutase activity was
undetectable. at holomutase activities greater than 18 pmol/min/mg, there
was no apparent relationship between the two parameters; for example, 14c
fixation was no greater in control cells grown in cbl-supplemented medium

discussion
the study of vitamin-responsive inborn errors of metabolism in man has
played a significant role not only in our understanding of the molecular and
cellular pathology associated with these inherited diseases but also in the
elucidation of normal processes of intracellular vitamin metabolism and
coenzyme-apoenzyme interactions (rosenberg, 1976). thus, in an earlier
study (willard and rosenberg, 1977), we investigated the effect of cbl supplementation in culture on a series of mutant cell lines with a primary defect in the
methylmalonyl coa mutase apoenzyme ( xxxg1485xxx  mutants) and described two
types of  xxxg1485xxx  mutations. one resulted in a complete deficiency of mutase
activity and showed no increase in 14c fixation after growth in cbl-supplemented medium. the second type resulted in a structurally altered apoenzyme
with a reduced affinity for adocbl and exhibited marked increases in 14c
fixation after growth in cbl-supplemented medium.
in the present study, we have studied further the effect of cbl supplementation in the growth medium on levels of methylmalonyl coa mutase activity
in control and mutant fibroblasts. the 22 mutant lines examined in this study
have an apparently normal mutase apoenzyme (morrow et al., 1975; morrow
and lebowitz, 1976; willard et al., 1978) and constitute four genetically and
biochemically distinct mutant classes with defects in cbl metabolism (gravel
et al., 1975; willard et al., 1978; mahoney et al., 1975; fenton and rosenberg,
1978; mellman et al., 1978).

"responsiveness" in human cobalamin mutants in culture

when these mutant cell lines were grown in medium supplemented with
0.01-1.0 #g  xxxd2300xxx /ml, three distinct patterns of response were noted. first,
several cbl b mutant cell lines were completely refractory to cbl supplementation, even at 1 #g  xxxd2300xxx /ml for 24 days, whether mutase activity was
estimated directly in cell extracts (table iii) or indirectly in intact cells using
the propionate fixation assay (table i, fig. 2). second, in two other cell lines
belonging to the ebl b mutant class, a small, but nonetheless detectable,
increase in 14c fixation and in holomutase activity was elicited after growth in
cbl-supplemented medium. and, third, in the remainder of the cell lines
(including all of those lines examined from the ebl a, cbl c, and cbl d
complementation groups and several cbl b mutants), holomutase activity

increased significantly in apparent response to the 200- to 20,000-fold increase
in cbl concentration in the growth medium (fig. 1, tables i and iii). these
increases were both time and concentration dependent (figs. i and 2); further,
they displayed saturability at an  xxxd2300xxx  concentration in the medium
between 0.01 and 0.1 pg/ml (fig. 2) and reached an apparent equilibrium after
4-7 days in cbl-supplemented medium.
in accordance with our previous study (willard and rosenberg, 1977),
we have interpreted the increases in ~4c fixation in these mutant cell lines as a
reflection of increased holomutase activity. the data in table iii support this
interpretation, and we therefore adopt the descriptive terms "responsive in
culture" and "unresponsive in culture" to refer to cell lines which display
either a demonstrable increase or no increase, respectively, in holomutase
activity after growth in cbl-supplemented medium.
the molecular basis for these variable responses in culture is as yet
unclear and is likely to differ among the four mutant classes. under basal
conditions, each of the 22 mutant cell lines is deficient in the synthesis of
adocbl from its precursor  xxxd2300xxx  (rosenberg et al., 1969; mudd et al., 1970;
morrow et al., 1975; linnell et al., 1976; willard et al., 1978). based on earlier
observations that adocbl content increases markedly when some cbl a
(rosenberg et al., 1969), cbl c or cbl d (linnell et al., 1976) lines are grown in
cbl-supplemented medium, it is reasonable to conclude that the increase in
holomutase activity in these mutants (table iii) reflects the fact that, under
supplemented conditions, sufficient  xxxd2300xxx  is present in the medium and cells
to overcome or bypass the inherited blocks in cbl metabolism. this relationship may be less than straightforward, however. for example, cbl c and cbl d
cells, after growth in medium containing 1 pg  xxxd2300xxx /ml, contain 30-50% as
much adocbl as control cells (linnelt et al., 1976) and yet appear to have
< 10% as much holomutase activity as do controls (table iii, fig. 4). further,
after cbl supplementation, these mutant cells contain 10-20 times as much
adocbl as do control cells under basal conditions (linnell et al., 1976) and yet
they express comparable holomutase activities (table iii). these conflicting
data may indicate that subcellular compartmentalization and apoenzyme
availability play a role in cbl responsiveness in culture in some mutant cells.
the only "unresponsive" mutants in this series were cbl b mutants (table
i). for example, holomutase activity in line 209 was completely refractory to
cbl supplementation in culture. linnell et al. (1976) previously found that
adocbl content in these cells (patient kb) did not increase after growth in
medium containing 1 #g  xxxd2300xxx /ml, suggesting that the genetic lesion in this
cbl b mutant is so severe that cbl supplementation in culture is without effect.
it is of interest that only within the cbl b complementation group did we
find evidence of intraclass heterogeneity, similar to that described previously
within the  xxxg1485xxx  complementation group (willard and rosenberg, 1977).

72

willard and rosenberg

mutants belonging to the cbl b class are deficient in atp: xxxd1771xxx 
adenosyltransferase activity (fenton and rosenberg, 1978), the final metabolic step in adocbl synthesis, and it is not surprising that a number of alleles
reflecting different mutations of varying severity would be present in a large
series of single gene mutants (table i). on the other hand, it is surprising
perhaps that all 14 cbl a, cbl c, and cbl d mutants examined are responsive in
culture to cbl supplementation. if our current hypotheses are correct, that
these three mutant classes reflect defects in the enzymatic reduction of
cob(iii)alamin ( xxxd2300xxx ) to  xxxd1771xxx  (fenton and rosenberg, 1978;
mellman et al., 1978), then our failure to detect unresponsive mutants belonging to these complementation groups may indicate the presence of nonspecific
reducing systems within the cell capable of producing sufficient  xxxd1771xxx 
under cbl-supplemented conditions in culture to allow limited adocbl synthesis and holomutase formation. alternatively, more severe blocks in these
steps in cbl metabolism may lead to death in utero, precluding the availability
of such mutant cell lines.

correlation of clinical responsiveness and responsiveness in culture
there have been few rigorous studies of clinical responsiveness to cbl in the
methylmalonicacidemias (rosenberg et al., 1968; rosenberg, 1978). generally it is difficult to distinguish between a response to cbl administration and a
response to protein restriction since both forms of treatment are usually
initiated simultaneously. while there do exist clear examples of cases responsive to cbl supplementation both in culture (tables i and iii; unpublished
observations) and clinically [ l f ( c b i a ) in rosenberg et al., 1968; 245 (cbl a) in
ampola et al., 1975; 491 (cbl c) in anthony and mcleay, 1976; 177 and 414
(cbl d) in goodman et al., 1970, 1972], and of cases unresponsive both
clinically and in culture [209 (cbl b) in table iii and kaye et al., 1974; linnell
et al,, 1976], there are also cases in which the correlation does not appear to
hold. for example, the cbl a mutant 214 is responsive in culture (table i) but
was reportedly clinically unresponsive (patient ts in kaye et al., 1974).
similarly, the rout mutant 394, which has a reduced affinity for adocbl and is
clearly responsive in culture (willard and rosenberg, 1977), was unequivocably unresponsive clinically (patient ct in wilcken et al., 1977). conversely,
the cbl b mutant 311 appears to be unresponsive to cbl supplementation in
culture (table i) but was chemically responsive to cbl therapy in vivo
(mahoney et al., 1976). thus, although increased holomutase activity likely
forms the basis for cbl therapy in these disorders, generalizations about cbl
responsiveness in the methylmalonicacidemias based on studies of cultured
fibroblasts are appropriately made and viewed with caution.

metabolic role of methylmalonyl coa mutase activity in cultured
fibroblasts

our data appear to have important consequences for understanding the role
of mutase and adocbl in determining total propionate pathway activity.
under basal growth conditions, mutase exists predominantly in the apoenzyme form in control cells (fig. 3b and table ii). when  xxxd2300xxx  is added to
the medium, however, holomutase activity increases dramatically in a concentration- and time-dependent fashion (table iii, figs. 3 and 4). [total
mutase activity also increases in these cells. although the basis for this effect is
as yet unclear, it appears to be, at least in part, a consequence of the greater
stability of holomutase relative to apomutase (unpublished observations).]
since the increase in holomutase activity is not accompanied by any increase
in propionate pathway activity, as measured by 14c fixation (fig. 1), mutase
must not be the rate-limiting enzyme in this pathway in control cells, even
under conditions of relative cbl depletion.
in mutant cells deficient in mutase activity, on the other hand, mutase
does become fate limiting, as reflected by the marked decrease in 14c fixation
(table i; willard et al., 1976) as well as by the accumulation of methylmalonate, both in cultured cells (morrow et al., 1969b; mudd et al., 1970) and
in affected patients' tissues (rosenberg, 1978).
as suggested by the clinical responsiveness of some patients with methylmalonicacidemia, however, this rate-limiting situation can be overcome to
various extents. in the present series of experiments, growth of some mutant
lines in cbl-supplemented medium enhanced holomutase activity sufficiently,
such that mutase was no longer the rate-limiting enzyme in propionate
metabolism (figs. 1 and 4; tables i and iii). while these observations offer a
rational interpretation of cbl responsiveness in culture for some mutant cell
lines, it is worth emphasizing that normal values for propionate fixation do
not necessarily reflect normal holomutase activity.
the degree to which these findings can be extended to other tissues or to
the level of a whole organism is, of course, conjectural. however, these data
would appear to be relevant to the in vivo situation, since virtually identical
results were obtained with cells grown in medium containing 10% human
serum as a source of transcobalamin ii, the serum protein which normally
mediates cellular uptake of cbl (youngdahl-turner et al., 1978). as such,
therefore, our data do indicate that only small increases in holomutase activity
after cbl administration may be required to overcome the inherited block in
propionate pathway activity in affected patients. on the basis of these fibroblast studies, we would suggest that enhancement of mutase activity in vivo to
levels as low as 5-10% of control may be sufficient to restore metabolism of
methylmalonate (and accordingly its excretion and accumulation) to normal.
