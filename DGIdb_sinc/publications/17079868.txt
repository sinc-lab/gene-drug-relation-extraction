abstract
homocysteine (hcy) is thought to play an important
role in the development of osteoporosis and fracture.
 xxxg1479xxx  reductase ( xxxg1480xxx ) is an enzyme
involved in the conversion of hcy to  xxxd2595xxx . we
hypothesized that certain genetic polymorphisms of
 xxxg1480xxx  leading to reduced enzyme activity may cause
hyperhomocysteinemia and affect bone metabo lism. we therefore examined the associations of the
a66g and c524t polymorphisms of the  xxxg1480xxx  gene
with bone mineral density (bmd) and serum
osteocalcin levels in postmenopausal women.
although we did not detect any significant asso -

ciations between  xxxg1480xxx  polymorphisms and bmd or
serum osteocalcin levels, we found that the
66g/524c haplotype, which has reduced enzyme
activity, was significantly associated with serum
osteocalcin levels in a gene-dose dependent manner
(p = 0.002). that is, the highest osteocalcin levels
(34.5 ± 16.8 ng/ml) were observed in subjects
bearing two copies, intermediate osteocalcin levels
(32.6 ± 14.4 ng/ml) were observed in subjects
bearing one copy, and the lowest levels of
osteocalcin (28.8 ± 10.9 ng/ml) were observed in
subjects bearing no copies. these results suggest
that the 66g/524c haplotype of the  xxxg1480xxx  gene affect
bone turn over rate.

introduction
hyperhomocysteinemia has been reported to be an
independent risk factor for osteoporotic fractures,
cardiovascular disease and cancer (song et al.,
2001; wald et al., 2002; gilfix, 2003; lee et al., 2004;
mclean et al., 2004; van meurs et al., 2004; sato et
al., 2005). treatment with  xxxd1771xxx   xxxd3520xxx  and folate,
which lower hcy levels, has been found to markedly
decrease the risk of hip fracture in stroke patients
(sato et al., 2005), indicating that hcy may play an
important role in the development of osteoporosis.
although the precise mechanisms of hcy-induced
osteoporosis has not been determined, interfering
with collagen cross-linking (lubec et al., 1996),
increased osteoclastic bone resorption (herrmann et
al., 2005) and decreased osteoblastic bone formation (kim et al., 2006), have been reported to contribute to the development of hcy- induced osteoporosis.
hcy, an intermediate metabolite of  xxxd2595xxx , is
reconverted to  xxxd2595xxx  by the transfer of a methyl
group from methylenetetrahydrofolate, a reduction
catalyzed by the enzyme  xxxg1479xxx  (dimitrova et al., 2002). this remethylation process
requires adequate levels of the cofactor, activated
cobalamin, which are maintained by the enzyme
 xxxg1480xxx . thus reduced activity of  xxxg1480xxx  should
disturb the remethylation of hcy resulting in hyperhomocysteinemia. indeed, a genetic defect in  xxxg1480xxx 
has been detected in patients with homocystinuria,

520 exp. mol. med. vol. 38(5), 519-524, 2006

an inherited disorder of hcy metabolism characterized by severe hyperhomocysteinemia and early
onset of atherosclerosis and osteoporosis (leclerc et
al., 1998). although the a66g and c524t genetic
polymorphisms of  xxxg1480xxx  have been reported to be
associated with enzyme activity (olteanu et al.,
2002) and plasma hcy concentration (botto et al.,
2003; vaughn et al., 2004), the association of these
polymorphisms with bone metabolism has not been
determined. we therefore investigated the relationships between the a66g and c524t polymorphisms of  xxxg1480xxx  gene and bone mineral density
and serum osteocalcin levels in postmenopausal
women.

materials and methods
subjects
the study population consisted of 560 apparently
healthy, postmenopausal women who had visited
asan medical center (seoul, korea) (kim et al.,
2005). in brief, menopause was defined as the
absence of menstruation for at least 6 months, which
was confirmed by a serum fsh concentration ＞ 30
iu/l. women who were prematurely menopausal
(under 40 years of age) were excluded. subjects
were also excluded if they had taken drugs, such as
bisphosphonates, estrogen and thyroid hormones,
that might affect bone metabolism for more than 6
months or within the previous 12 months, or if they
had suffered from any disease, such as thyroid
diseases, hyperparathyroidism and renal failure, that
might affect bone metabolism. women were also
excluded if they had osteophytic formation above the
fourth grade of the nathan classification (nathan et
al., 1962), and/or severe facet joint osteoarthritis in
the lumbar spine diagnosed using conventional
spine radiographs. the study was approved by the
institutional review of board of asan medical
center, and written informed consent was obtained
from each participant.

bmd measurement
bmd at the lumbar spine (l2-l4) and femoral neck
was measured using dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (lunar, expert xl, madison, wi) in 431
women. in the remaining 129 women, bmd was
measured using hologic equipment (qdr 4500-a,
waltham, ma). the coefficients of variation (cv) for
the lunar and hologic equipment were 0.82% and
0.85%, respectively, for the lumbar spine and 1.12%
and 1.20%, respectively, for the femoral neck.

measurement of serum osteocalcin levels
fasting venous blood samples were obtained
between 8 and 10 a. xxxd2595xxx . and centrifuged, and the
sera were stored at -80oc until assayed. serum
osteocalcin concentrations were determined using
an immunoradiometric assay kit (osteo-riact,
cis bio international, france). the mean inter-assay
cv was 2.8%, and the mean intra-assay cv was
5.2%.
genotyping analysis
genomic dna was extracted from peripheral blood
leukocytes using a wizard genomic dna purification kit (promega, madison, wi). for genotyping of
the  xxxg1480xxx  gene (ref. seq. of  xxxg1480xxx  mrna: nm_
002454 and contig: nt_006576), pcr primers and
probes were designed by primer express (applied
biosystems, foster city, ca) (table 1). one allelic
probe was labeled with the fam dye and the other
with the fluorescent vic dye. pcr reaction were
performed in a 384-well format in taqman universal
master mix without ung (applied biosystems), in a
total reaction volume of 5 µl using 20ng of genomic
dna, pcr primer concentrations of 900 nm and
taqman mgb-probe concentrations of 200 nm. the
plates were placed in a pe 977 thermal cycler
(applied biosystems) and heated at 50oc for 2 min
and 95oc for 10 min followed by 40 cycles of 95 oc
for 15 sec and 60oc for 1 min. the taqman assay
plates were transferred to a prism 7900ht
instrument (applied biosystems) where the fluorescence intensity in each well of the plate was read.
fluorescence data files from each plate were
analyzed using automated software (sds 2.1;
applied biosystems).
statistics

chi tests were used to determine whether individual
variants at each locus were in hardy-weinberg
equilibrium in the population. we exmamined le-

equipment (0.870 ± 0.182 g/cm 2 at the lumbar spine
and 0.723 ± 0.128 g/cm 2 at the femoral neck) was
significantly higher than bmd measured by hologic
equipment (0.764 ± 0.116 g/cm 2 at the lumbar spine
and 0.606 ± 0.098 g/cm 2 at the femoral neck. p ＜
0.0001 for each). therefore, we added the type of
the densitometry as a covariate during statistical
analysis (kim et al., 2005). as previously described
(cifuentes et al., 2003) body weight was found to be
negatively correlated with serum osteocalcin levels
(table 2) and was included as a covariate for statistical analysis. regression analysis revealed that
 xxxg1480xxx  polymorphisms showed no association with
bmi.
the frequencies of variant alleles for the a66g
and c524t polymorphisms were 0.29 and 0.13, respectively. the polymorphisms were in hardy-weinberg equilibrium. two sites were not in linkage
disequilibrium (r2 = 0.156, linkage disequilibrium coefficient = 0.637). the frequency of the 66g allele
was significantly lower than observed in caucasian
subjects (0.29 vs. 0.5; wilson et al., 1999).
we analyzed the associations between bmd and
these polymorphisms after adjustment for age, ysm,
weight, height and type of bone densitometer (table
3). we found, however, that neither polymorphism
was associated with bmd at the lumbar spine and
femoral neck. although we observed weak associations between the a66g and c524t alleles and
serum osteocalcin concentrations, these associations were not significant (table 4).
since the haplotype, including 66g/524c alleles
(frequency 0.19), was reported to be associated with

wontin’s d'(|d'|) and the linkage disequlibrium
coefficient, r2, between the biallelic loci (hedrick,
1987; hedrick et al., 2001).
haplotypes (ht) of each individual were inferred
using the algorithm (phase; stephens et al., 2001)
which uses a bayesian approach incorporating a
priori expectations of haplotypic structure based on
population genetics and coalescent theory. phase
probabilities of all polymorphic sites for haplotypes
were calculated for each individual using this
software. individuals with phase probabilities of less
than 97% were excluded in analysis. the genetic
effects of inferred haplotypes were analyzed in the
same way as polymorphisms. multiple regression
analyses were performed for bmd controlling for
age (continuous variable), years since menopause
(ysm; continuous variable), weight, height, and type
of bone densitometer as covariates, and osteocalcin
controlling for age (continuous variable), ysm
(continuous variable), weight and height. a value of
p ＜ 0.05 was considered statistically significant.

results
the mean age, height, weight, body mass index
(bmi) and ysm of the subjects were 59.4 ± 7.2
years (range 46-83 years), 154.8 ± 5.3 cm, 56.5 ±
2
7.4 kg, 23.6 ± 2.9 kg/ xxxd2595xxx  and 10.4 ± 8.2 years
(range 1-35 years), respectively. as expected, the
age, ysm, weight, and height were each significantly
correlated with bmd at both the lumbar spine and
femoral neck (table 2). bmd measured by lunar

reduced enzyme activity (olteanu et al., 2002), we
examined the association of this haplotype with
bmd and osteocalcin concentration. although we
observed no difference in bmd at the lumbar spine
and femoral neck according to the haplotype (table
3), we observed an association between this haplotype and serum osteocalcin levels (p = 0.002 in both
codominant and dominant models) in a gene-dose
dependent manner. that is, the highest osteocalcin
concentrations (34.5 ± 16.8 ng/ml) were detected in
individuals bearing two copies of this haplotype,
intermediate levels (32.6 ± 14.4 ng/ml) were detected in subjects bearing one copy, and the lowest
levels (28.8 ± 10.9 ng/ml) were observed in subjects bearing no copies (table 4).

discussion
in relation to hcy-induced osteoporosis, some studies
(miyao et al., 2000; abrahamsen et al., 2003;
bathum et al., 2004; villadsen et al., 2005) have
reported that the c677t polymorphism of the gene
encoding  xxxg1475xxx , which
catalyzes the conversion of 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate to 5-methylenetetrahydrofolate, the substrate for hcy methylation, was associated with
osteoporosis and increased fracture risk. however,
to our knowledge, an association between the polymorphisms of  xxxg1480xxx  gene and bone metabolism
has not been reported.

we have shown here that the  xxxg1480xxx  haplotype
(66g/524c) is associated with serum osteocalcin
concentrations in postmenopausal women. although
neither polymorphism was significantly associated
with bmd and serum osteocalcin levels, we observed trends between these  xxxg1480xxx  polymorphisms
and osteocalcin concentrations. specifically, subjects with the 66g and 524c alleles had higher
serum osteocalcin levels than those with the 66a
and 524t alleles, respectively. the positive association of the 66g/ 524c haplotype with osteocalcin
levels may result from the sum of the modest effects
of each individual allele on bone metabolism.
 xxxg1480xxx  is a dual flavoprotein that catalyses the
conversion of cob(ii)alamin into methyl-cob(iii)alamin, the cofactor of  xxxg1479xxx  (olteanu et
al., 2001; 2002). fad ( xxxd2112xxx )
and fmn (flavin mononucleotide) facilitate electron
transfer from nadph to cob(ii)alamin during reductive methylation. this reductive methylation of
cob(ii)alamin may serve to maintain  xxxd2595xxx 
synthase in its active form. the a66g and c524t
sequence variants change the coding sequence
from isoleucine to  xxxd2595xxx  (ile22met) and from
serine to leucine (ser175leu), respectively. the
a66g variant is located in the fmn domain and may
therefore interact with  xxxg1479xxx  (hall et
al., 2000; 2001). although we did not measure
plasma hcy levels, the 66g/524c haplotype was
found to have 4-fold lower enzyme activity than wild
type (olteanu et al., 2002) and the 66g allele has

association of  xxxg1480xxx  haplotype with serum osteocalcin levels 523

been reported to be associated with higher plasma
hcy concentrations (botto et al., 2003; vaughn et al.,
2004). our finding, demonstrating that the 66g/524c
haplotype was associated with higher osteocalcin
concentrations, further supports that hyperhomocysteinemia is associated with higher osteocalcin levels
(dhonukshe-rutten et al., 2005).
osteocalcin is a product of osteoblasts that is
considered a marker of bone formation (brown et al.,
1984). however, osteocalcin is also released from
bone matrix into blood during bone resorption,
suggesting that osteocalcin is also a marker of bone
turnover (delmas et al., 1990; page et al., 1993;
ivaska et al., 2004). thus the higher serum osteocalcin levels observed in individuals with the
66g/524c haplotype may reflect increased bone
turnover rather than simply increased bone formation and thus may be associated with an increased risk of fracture (garnero et al., 1996).
osteoporosis is a skeletal disorder characterized
by compromised bone strength, which predisposes
individuals to an increased risk of fracture (nih
consensus development panel on osteoporosis
prevention, diagnosis, and therapy, 2001). in patients with homocystinuria, severe hyperhomocysteinemia is associated with very low bone mass
(parrot et al., 2000). in the general population, mild
to moderate hyperhomocysteinemia is associated
with an increased risk of fracture (mclean et al.,
2004; van meurs et al., 2004; sato et al., 2005), but
not with bmd, suggesting that mild to moderate
increases in hcy concentration may compromise
bone strength by reducing bone quality rather than
bone density. this may explain, at least in part, the
lack of association between  xxxg1480xxx  polymorphisms
and bmd.
this study has some limitations. since serum hcy
concentration was not measured in our study subjects, we could not document a direct association
between the  xxxg1480xxx  66g/524h haplotype and serum
homocysteine concentration. however, previous studies, demonstrating an association of  xxxg1480xxx  66g/
524h haplotype with low enzyme activity and thus
high plasma hcy level, suggest that this haplotype
has a functional relevance in regulation of hcy levels
in plasma. we did not measure the concentration of
other biochemical markers of bone turnover. measurement of other specific bone turnover markers
would support the relationship between  xxxg1480xxx 
haplotype and bone metabolism. in addition, we did
not measure the serum concentrations of vitamin
b12 and folate concentration. since the effect of the
a66g polymorphism of  xxxg1480xxx  would be more
pronounced in subjects with low cobalamin levels
(wilson et al., 1999), our results assume no difference in cobalamin and folate concentrations.

in conclusion, we found that the 66g/524c
haplotype of the  xxxg1480xxx  gene was associated with
serum osteocalcin concentrations in postmenopausal women, suggesting that this haplotype may
affect bone turnover rate.
