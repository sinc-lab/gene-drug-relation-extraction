a basic question in ion channel biology is how regulatory
subunits modulate pore gating. multiple solutions have
evolved; for example, kv channels associate with and are regulated by small soluble cytoplasmic ␤-subunits (see, for example, ref. 1) acting at the cytoplasmic face of the channel. atp-

sensitive potassium channels present a more complex picture
in which the regulatory sulfonylurea-binding subunits, surs,1
are large, multitransmembrane helix, atp-binding cassette
proteins usually illustrated surrounding a tetrameric pore composed of kir6.1 and/or  xxxg1250xxx  subunits (2, 3). this architecture
implies that multiple intersubunit contacts between sur and
kir6.0 control the inhibitory and stimulatory ligand gating of
katp channels and presents the experimental problem of how
to delimit the regions of contact modulating channel activity.
inhibitory gating is a hallmark of katp channels that burst
in ligand-free solution. at half-maximally inhibiting concentrations (ic50), atp and sulfonylureas shorten bursts of k⫹ driving force-dependent openings and lengthen voltage-independent interburst intervals (4 – 6). concentrations of atp ⬎⬎
ic50(atp) (the ic50 for atp in the absence of mg2⫹) ⬃ 10⫺5 m
also reduce the mean open time (␶o), without changing significantly the mean closed time of the vm-dependent intraburst
gaps (␶cf) (e.g. ref. 7). sur-dependent channel stimulators,
including mg-adp/atp, other magnesium nucleotide diphosphates, and  xxxg1253xxx  openers like  xxxd1868xxx , induce opposite changes in burst/interburst times (e.g. ref. 6). different
single channel transition schemes with atp binding to closed,
open, or both states have been proposed to account for katp
channel gating. recent observations question models with interburst closed state-delimited binding of atp (e.g. refs. 7, 8,
and 19). the structural determinants of ligand recognition and
molecular gating in katp channels, including the kir6.0/sur
contacts that modulate the mean open channel probability in
ligand-free solution (po(max)), have not been identified.
the effects of kir/sur interactions on  xxxg1253xxx  gating
were established by a side-by-side comparison of homomeric
 xxxg1250xxx ⌬c35 2 pores with  xxxg1250xxx ⌬c35/ xxxg19xxx  and  xxxg1250xxx ⌬c35/
sur2a channels (9, 10). these studies showed that kir/sur
interactions 1) increase the ␶o, the k⫹ driving force-dependent
mean open time, by ⬃2.5-fold; 2) dramatically increase the
po(max) as a consequence of the reduced occupancy of the voltage-independent interburst closed state(s), an effect that is
more marked for the  xxxg20xxx  isoform; and 3) markedly decrease
the apparent ic50(atp), an effect that is more pronounced for
 xxxg19xxx . the results imply that association of kir with sur,
presumably through an interaction involving its transmembrane m1 domain (11), increases the vm-dependent ␶o, which is
relatively insensitive to perturbations of the cytoplasmic parts
of  xxxg1253xxx  subunits (10, 12, 13). this suggests that inter1

ntp and ctp, synthetic peptides based on the n- and
c-terminal sequences of kir6.0, respectively, were used
to probe gating of kir6.0/sur katp channels. micromolar ntp dose-dependently increased the mean open
channel probability in ligand-free solution (po(max)) and
attenuated the atp inhibition of  xxxg1250xxx / xxxg19xxx , but had
no effect on homomeric  xxxg1250xxx  channels. ntp (up to
⬃10ⴚ4 m) did not affect significantly the mean open or
“fast,” kⴙ driving force-dependent, intraburst closed
times, verifying that ntp selectively modulates the ratio
of mean burst to interburst times. ctp and rnp, a randomized ntp, had no effect, indicating that the effects of
ntp are structure specific. ntp opened kir6.1/ xxxg19xxx 
channels normally silent in the absence of stimulatory
mgⴚ nucleotide(s) and attenuated the coupling of highaffinity sulfonylurea binding with katp pore closure.
these effects resemble those seen with n-terminal deletions (⌬n) of kir6.0, and application of ntp to ⌬nkatp
channels decreased their po(max) and apparent ic50 for
atp in the absence of mg2ⴙ. the results are consistent
with a competition between ntp and the endogenous n
terminus for a site of interaction on the cytoplasmic face
of the channel or with partial replacement of the deleted
n terminus by ntp, respectively. the kir n terminus and
the tmd0-l0 segment of  xxxg19xxx  are known to control the
po(max). the l0 linker has been reported to be required
for  xxxd2215xxx  binding, and ⌬nkir6.2/ xxxg19xxx  channels
exhibit reduced labeling of kir with 125i-azidoglibenclamide, implying that the kir n terminus and l0 of
 xxxg19xxx  are in proximity. we hypothesize that l0 interacts
with the kir n terminus in ligand-inhibited katp channels and put forward a model, based on the architecture
of btucd, msba, and the kcsa channel, in which
tmd0-l0 links the mdr-like core of sur with the kir
pore.

coupling of the n terminus of kir6.0 to  xxxg19xxx

this general formulation is independent of arguments about the
degree of coupling between multiple “gates.”

tween the proximal n- and c-terminal domains of kir.4 the
results are consistent with the proposed involvement of both
the n and c termini in controlling what has been termed a
“slow, cytoplasmic gate” in chimeric kir6.1⬃ xxxg1250xxx /sur channels independently of whether the transmembrane core is from
kir6.1 or  xxxg1250xxx  (20, 21). isolated proximal n-terminal fragments of  xxxg1250xxx  fused with gst will pull-down c-terminal
peptides (22). the tight binding of these domains is consistent
with a role in channel assembly. binding of the proximal cterminal domain of  xxxg1250xxx  to  xxxg19xxx  has also been proposed to
determine their co-assembly (23), although others (11), using a
different biochemical assay, have concluded that the m1 helix
of kir and/or its n-terminal extension co-associates with sur.
it is unclear whether these stable intra- and intersubunit contacts specify channel dynamics versus assembly.
to search for interactions that control gating and that are
presumably dependent on open versus closed states of the channel, we examined the effect of synthetic peptides on the po(max)
of kir6.0/ xxxg19xxx  channels and their inhibition by atp and sulfonylureas and correlated these with the effect of ⌬nkir6.2
deletion on co-photolabeling of kir by 125i-azidoglibenclamide
bound to  xxxg19xxx . our findings suggest a model in which sequence-specific interactions between the first half of the n
terminus of kir6.0 and a cytoplasmic loop of  xxxg19xxx  increase the
occupancy of the vm-independent, interburst closed state(s) of
katp channels. similar functional assays could be used to
identify intersubunit interactions that control gating of other
ion channels and electrogenic transporters.
experimental procedures

molecular biology—the generation of cdna constructs and their
expression in cosm6 cells have been described (12, 19).
protein secondary structure prediction—this was done by both
phdsec (24) and hidden markov  xxxg1888xxx  (25) modeling using bioinformatics resources and alignment engines.5
peptide preparation—the biotinylated (biot) peptide ntp, containing
a segment of human  xxxg1250xxx  from leu2 through ala33 (biot-cys-gly-leuser-arg-lys-gly-ile-ile-pro-glu-glu-tyr-val-leu-thr-arg-leu-alaglu-asp-pro-ala-glu-pro-arg-tyr-arg-ala-arg-gln-arg-arg-ala-nh2);
the corresponding random peptide rnp, with the same amino acid
composition; and the peptide ctp, containing a c-terminal segment of
 xxxg1250xxx  from lys170 through lys207 (biot-cys-lys-thr-ala-gln-ala-hisarg-arg-ala-glu-thr-leu-ile-phe-ser-lys-his-ala-val-ile-ala-leuarg-his-gly-arg-leu-cys-phe-met-leu-arg-val-gly-asp-leu-arg-lysnh2) were made by conventional solid-phase synthesis and purified by
hplc in the baylor protein chemistry core laboratory. masses were
confirmed by mass spectrometry, and purities were verified by analytical hplc and amino acid analysis. all three peptides are hydrophilic
and readily soluble in intracellular solution (see below) and were stored
at ⬃2 mm in aqueous solution at ⫺20 °c.
high-affinity photolabeling of  xxxg19xxx  and co-photolabeling of the kir
with 125i-azidoglibenclamide—cosm6 cells cotransfected with  xxxg19xxx 
plus  xxxg1250xxx  or ⌬n32kir6.2 were labeled in vivo with 125i-azidoglibenclamide (1 nm), subjected to electrophoresis, and prepared for autoradiography as described previously (2, 26). the incorporation of 125i into
the  xxxg19xxx  and kir bands was estimated by densitometry of the
autoradiographs.
patch-clamp recordings and single channel kinetic analysis—
these were done as described previously (9, 12, 19). the pipette solution
contained 145 mm kcl, 1 mm mgcl2, 1 mm cacl2, and 10 mm hepes,
ph 7.4 adjusted with koh, unless otherwise noted. the intracellular
bath solution contained 140 mm kcl, 1 mm mgcl2, 5 mm egta, 5 mm
hepes, and 10 mm koh, ph 7.2 adjusted with koh. nucleotides,
 xxxd3394xxx , and  xxxd2215xxx  were from sigma. [mg2⫹]i was kept at
a quasi-cytosolic level of ⬃0.7 mm by adding mgcl2. the mg2⫹-free
internal solution contained 140 mm kcl, 5 mm edta, 5 mm hepes,
and 10 mm koh, ph 7.2 adjusted with koh. the holding potential was

this is consistent with the notion that size, rather than charge or
hydrophobicity of the side chain of residue 50, is critical for the atp
inhibitory gating (43).

actions within the transmembrane electrical field can stabilize
a conducting conformation of the pore, whereas separable cytoplasmic contacts between sur and  xxxg1250xxx  can favor a longlived closed conformation of the kir 3 and decrease the apparent kd for inhibitory atp.
comparison of chimeric  xxxg1250xxx / xxxg19xxx ⬃sur2a channels (10)
first showed that an  xxxg19xxx  segment including tmd0 and the
cytoplasmic l0 linker (based on the topology in refs. 14 and 15)
specifies the lower po(max) of ␤-cell channels ( xxxg1250xxx / xxxg19xxx ),
implying its participation in a regulatory contact. additionally,
the l0 linker has been reported to be necessary for the binding
of the sulfonylurea  xxxd2215xxx  (16), which inhibits katp
channels. the necessity of the l0 linker for the transport
functions of the  xxxg12xxx  mrp1, an atpbinding cassette protein closely related to sur, has been elegantly demonstrated by bakos et al. (17).
n-terminal truncations (⌬n) of  xxxg1250xxx  provided the first
evidence for involvement of the initial, “distal” half of the
cytoplasmic n terminus of kir in sur-dependent interactions
that control the ligand-sensitive kinetics of katp channels (12,
18). ⌬n32kir6.2, like ⌬n44kir6.2, produces ⌬nkir6.2/ xxxg19xxx 
channels with dramatically elongated bursts and apparently
destabilized interburst closed state(s), but normal values of ␶o
and intraburst ␶cf (12). the ⌬n32 deletion increases the
ic50(atp) of ⌬nkir6.2/ xxxg19xxx  channels from ⬃6 to ⬃90 ␮m,
without affecting the higher ic50(atp) (⬃0.2 mm) and much
lower po(max) values of homomeric inward rectifiers (see also
ref. 18). these findings suggest three things. first, the n
terminus of kir reduces the mean open channel probability
(po), the maximum of which is limited to ␶o/(␶o ⫹ ␶cf), a value
that must be set by contacts between a conserved domain(s) in
sur and a region(s) of kir distinct from the first half of the n
terminus. second, deletion of up to 44 amino acids from the n
terminus does not disrupt the atp-binding site of kir, which,
in the kir/sur complex, is able to bind inhibitory atp in both
the open and closed states. third, the n terminus facilitates
transitions to interburst conformation(s), which may have the
highest microaffinity for atp, although contacts between the
kir n terminus and sur are not sufficient to account completely for the enhanced apparent affinity for inhibitory atp of
katp channels versus homomeric  xxxg1250xxx ⌬c35 pores. the conserved distal n terminus also participates in contacts that
stabilize the ligand-sensitive closed state of kir6.1-based channels. these “kndp” channels normally require a stimulatory
magnesium nucleotide diphosphate or hydrolyzable triphosphate and mg2⫹ for their opening; however, truncation of the n
terminus of kir6.1 induces bursting of ⌬nkir6.1/ xxxg19xxx  channels in nucleotide-free solutions (19). the po(max) of ⌬nkir6.1/
 xxxg19xxx  and ⌬nkir6.2/ xxxg19xxx  channels is similarly reduced by
atp, indicating that both are atp-sensitive (19). these studies
do not provide an explanation for the activity of the n terminus
(i.e. whether a specific peptide sequence is needed, or whether
a simple charge is sufficient), nor do they suggest which domains the n terminus might interact with during  xxxg1253xxx 
gating.
a functional role for the proximal half of the kir n terminus
has not been clarified by truncation mainly because deletions
greater than ⌬n44 fail to produce channels when coexpressed
with sur (12, 19). the sur-dependent increase in po(max), due
to an increased occupancy of interburst closed state(s), observed in  xxxg1250xxx (r50q/k185q)/ xxxg19xxx  channels with mutations
in both submembrane segments (12) implies interactions be-

which all kir6.0-containing channels were closed. solutions were exchanged within 2 ms. patch currents recorded at 2–10 khz (digitized at
20 –100 khz) were used to determine the unitary conductance (g), single
channel kinetics, and atp dose responses. the po was estimated from

showing a single level opening is valid. the differences in averaged
values (expressed as means ⫾ s.d.) with p ⬍ 0.05 determined by a
series of tests, including independent t tests (originpro version 7,
microcal inc., northampton, ma), were considered significant.

effects of ntp on the po(max) of katp and ⌬nkatp channels—
ntp (but not rnp or ctp) dose-dependently increased the
po(max) of  xxxg1250xxx / xxxg19xxx  channels in the absence of nucleotides
(fig. 1a). the ␶o and ␶cf values are not significantly affected by

versus 0.25 ⫾ 0.03 ms in the presence and absence of ntp,
respectively, at a k⫹ driving force of ⫺40 mv (12)). the resulting po(max) at saturating concentrations of ntp was close to the

katp and ⌬nkatp channels in insideout patches. a, response of  xxxg1250xxx / xxxg19xxx 
channel macrocurrents to application of
ntp. application of rnp or ctp was without significant effect. b, ntp modulates
the interburst kinetics of a single  xxxg1250xxx /
 xxxg19xxx  channel, resulting in an increase in
its spontaneous po. this recording was
done at 0 mv, with the pipette solution
containing 140 mm nacl, 5 mm kcl, 1 mm
mgcl2, 1 mm cacl2, and 10 mm hepes,
ph 7.4 adjusted with naoh, to prevent
currents through nonselective channels.
these experimental conditions were used
previously to quantify comparable effects
on the interburst kinetics of ⌬n32kir6.2/
 xxxg19xxx  channels (12). the ⬃22% increase
in the po(max) determined from the amplitude histograms (shown on the right) is
consistent with the increase in katp macrocurrents in a. we obtained another single  xxxg1253xxx  displaying po(max) ⬃ 0.6
for ⬃1 min under similar conditions. ntp
shortened the voltage-independent gaps
by ⬃40% in both experiments, but the
data are insufficient to report statistically
representative mean interburst time(s)
with versus without ntp. c, ntp (but not
rnp or ctp) decreases the spontaneous
activity of ⌬n32kir6.2 channels. d, ntp
dose responses for intact and truncated
channels. the individual npo(max) values
in the presence of different concentrations
of ntp were normalized to those in the
absence ntp (three and three different
patches, respectively).

voltage-independent, interburst closed state, and is not partially inactivated or “rundown.” single channel recording before significant rundown had occurred (fig. 1b) verified that
 xxxg1250xxx / xxxg19xxx  channels were open ⬃91% of the time in the
presence of 30 ␮m ntp versus ⬃74% of time with no ntp (see a
comparable control value in a previous report (9)). ntp had no
effect on the po(max) of homomeric  xxxg1250xxx ⌬c35 channels lacking sur (0.089 ⫾ 0.009 determined in 30 ␮m ntp is similar to
the previously determined control values of 0.09 ⫾ 0.01 (9)).
the increased po(max) with ntp reflects a decrease in the occupancy of interburst closed states comparable with that produced by n-terminal deletions (⌬n) of  xxxg1250xxx  (12). therefore,
we tested the ability of ntp to reduce the po(max) of ⌬nkatp
channels. ntp (but not rnp or ctp) decreased the po(max) of
⌬n32kir6.2/ xxxg19xxx  channels, the activity of which was nearmaximal as a consequence of n-terminal truncation (fig. 1c).
the effects of ntp on the po(max) of both intact and n-terminally truncated channels were dose-dependent, with half-maximal concentrations of ⬃10 –15 ␮m (fig. 1d). ntp was not as
effective in reducing the po(max) as the endogenous n terminus
and only partially restored wild-type gating.

coupling of the n terminus of kir6.0 to  xxxg19xxx 

of  xxxg1250xxx / xxxg19xxx  channels in a dose-dependent manner (fig.
2a). this phenomenon also resembles the effect of n-terminal
deletions that reduce the atp inhibition of ⌬ xxxg2242xxx / xxxg19xxx  channels without affecting homomeric ⌬ xxxg2242xxx  channels (18, 27). ntp
could partially restore wild-type atp inhibition to ⌬n32kir6.2/
 xxxg19xxx  channels. atp (100 ␮m), with or without ntp (up to 100
␮m), was equally effective in inhibiting homomeric kir⌬c35
channels, used as sensors for low-affinity atp binding (9),
indicating that the n-terminal peptide does not bind atp. fig.
2b shows that ntp shifted the ic50(atp) for intact channels to
the right, whereas it had the opposite effect on ⌬n32kir6.2/
 xxxg19xxx  channels, partially reversing the effect of n-terminal
truncations. the results substantiate our original conclusion,
based on ⌬n32kir6.2/ xxxg19xxx  and ⌬n44kir6.2/ xxxg19xxx  channels
(12), that the first half of the n terminus of  xxxg1250xxx  does not
form a low-affinity atp-binding pocket, although it does appear to stabilize the atp-locked pore through contact with
 xxxg19xxx .
effects of ntp on kntp and ⌬nkntp channels—the n-terminal sequences of kir6.1 and  xxxg1250xxx  are similar, differing by
2 amino acids in the first 14 residues, with 55% identity over
the 33 residues included in ntp. we therefore tested whether
ntp would reduce the intrinsic stability of kir6.1/ xxxg19xxx  kndp
channels, opening them in the absence of stimulatory mg⫺
nucleotides. application of ntp (30 ␮m) elicited a low-po activity in these channels, which was reduced by 100 ␮m atp (fig.
3a). a similar “activation” was achieved by concatenation of the
n and c termini of kir6.1 through -gggsggga- linkers or by
short deletions of the n terminus (19), consistent with the n
terminus playing a dynamic role in stabilization of the interburst closed state. the po(max) of ⌬n33kir6.1/ xxxg19xxx  channels
was attenuated by ntp, which also enhanced atp inhibition

(fig. 3b, left panel). n-terminal deletion did not compromise
the mg⫺ nucleotide-dependent stimulatory action of sur on
kir6.1; the po of ⌬n33kir6.1/ xxxg19xxx  channels was increased to
ⱖ0.7 by 10 mm mg-udp in the presence of 30 ␮m ntp (four
independent experiments; see an example in fig. 3b (right
panel) and similar experiments without ntp in ref. 19). similar
perturbations of  xxxg1250xxx  did not alter its stimulation by  xxxg19xxx 
(27). application of ctp was ineffective on all of the tested
channels.
effects of ntp on the coupling of high-affinity sulfonylurea
binding to closure of  xxxg1250xxx —we have shown previously that
200 ␮m  xxxd3394xxx  saturates the high-affinity (but not lowaffinity) binding sites on intact katp channels, reducing the
po(max) by ⬃60% (27). progressive truncation of the n terminus
of  xxxg1250xxx  uncouples the effect of high-affinity sulfonylurea
binding to  xxxg19xxx  from channel closure, resulting in an ⬃2-fold
higher relative npo(max) for ⌬n32katp versus katp channels in
the presence of 200 ␮m  xxxd3394xxx  (⬃85 versus ⬃42%; see ref.
27). therefore, we tested the ability of ntp to uncouple  xxxg19xxx 
from  xxxg1250xxx  and to reduce the inhibitory effect of  xxxd3394xxx .
ntp (30 ␮m) increased the fraction of npo(max) of  xxxg1250xxx / xxxg19xxx 
channels in the presence of 200 ␮m  xxxd3394xxx  from ⬃0.43 to
⬃0.64 (fig. 4a). this 1.49 ⫾ 0.05-fold increase exceeded the
1.2 ⫾ 0.04-fold increase by ntp in the absence of drug (fig. 1d),
consistent with partial uncoupling. similar experiments with
the more potent sulfonylurea  xxxd2215xxx  were complicated
by its slower dissociation rate, but we estimated ⬃1.33- and
1.42-fold increases (two patches) in katp currents over 20 s
following addition of 30 ␮m ntp to 30 nm  xxxd2215xxx , which
is sufficient to saturate the nanomolar (but not micromolar)
affinity sulfonylurea-binding sites on  xxxg1250xxx / xxxg19xxx  channels
(27). to determine whether ntp interacts with  xxxd2215xxx ,

to application of ntp in the presence of 0.1 mm atp. application of 0.1 mm rnp to two other patches resulted in a small decrease or in no detectable
change in the npo in the presence of 0.1 mm atp; the averaged “response” to this high concentration of rnp was not significantly different from
that with application of buffer without rnp (three patches). application of ctp was also without significant effect. note that the differences in katp
currents at different [atp]/[ntp] are inconsistent with ntp binding atp at a fixed stoichiometry. b, ntp shifts the inhibitory atp dose-response
curves for the wild-type and truncated channels, as shown by the arrows. the ic50(atp) values derived from pseudo-hill fits are 6.1 versus 44.7 ␮m
and 87.6 versus 28.7 ␮m in the absence versus presence of 100 ␮m ntp for the intact and truncated channels, respectively (three and three patches,
respectively).

fig. 3. ntp modulates kntp and ⌬nkntp channels. a, ntp can open kndp channels inhibited by submillimolar atp. the vertical arrow
shows isolation of the inside-out patch. b, ntp attenuates the spontaneous activity of ⌬nkndp channels and potentiates their inhibition by atp
(left trace) without altering their stimulation by mg⫺ nucleotides (right trace). the low inhibitory potency of mg-udp (19, 27) is advantageous for
testing the stimulatory action.

we used homomeric  xxxg1250xxx ⌬c35 channels as low-affinity sensors of sulfonylureas (27).  xxxd2215xxx  (3 ␮m) similarly reduced their activity in the presence or absence of 30 ␮m ntp,
consistent with no reduction in the effective concentration of
the drug. to test the ability of ntp to recouple ⌬ xxxg2242xxx  to sur
and to restore sensitivity to sulfonylureas, ntp was applied to
⌬n32kir6.2/ xxxg19xxx  channels in the presence of  xxxd3394xxx 
(200 ␮m). application of ntp decreased rather than increased
channel activity, consistent with partial recoupling; but the
effect was small, thus limiting the significance of a comparison
with the effect of ntp alone.

loop of  xxxg19xxx —125i- xxxd2215xxx  photolabels the n-terminal
portion of  xxxg19xxx  (28) that contains the ⬃100-residue intracellular l0 linker (14, 15) reported to be required for high-affinity
 xxxd2215xxx  binding (16). at nanomolar concentrations, 125iazidoglibenclamide photolabels  xxxg1250xxx  only in the presence of
 xxxg19xxx  (2). although ⌬n32kir6.2 and  xxxg19xxx  assemble functional channels, which are stimulated by katp openers and/or
magnesium nucleotides (27), the ⌬n32 deletion strongly compromised co-labeling of kir (fig. 4b). the data imply that
n-terminal deletions either remove or alter the positioning of

one or more residues close to the short-lived nitrene group
generated upon photolysis of azidoglibenclamide. as only  xxxg19xxx 
fragments containing l0 can be photolabeled (28, 40), the results are consistent with the idea that l0 and the n terminus
of kir are in close proximity.
discussion

we have shown that application of ntp, a short peptide
equivalent to the initial n terminus of  xxxg1250xxx , to the cytoplasmic face of intact kir6.0/ xxxg19xxx  channels increased their open
probability. application of ntp to ⌬nkir6.0/ xxxg19xxx  channels,
the open probability of which is already at a maximal value as
a consequence of truncating the n terminus, slightly reduced
their po(max). thus, the initial n terminus of  xxxg1250xxx , homologous in both kir6.0 isoforms, can alter the stability of burst
versus interburst conformation(s) of kir6.0-based channels.
the effects were sur-dependent, as the n-terminal peptide did
not alter the gating of homomeric kir channels. the effects
were selective, as ntp did not significantly affect ␶cf or ␶o,
characterizing the fast intraburst kinetics of heteromultimeric
channels, or alter their responsiveness to the mg⫺ nucleotidedependent stimulatory action of sur. the effects of ntp were

relatively low-affinity, in agreement with the notion that hydrophilic peptides may adopt many conformations in solution,
resulting in a lower effective concentration; with the observation that a synthetic peptide based on the hydrophilic n terminus of kv␤1.1, which shows only transient formation of local
structures in solution, inactivates kv channels with micromolar affinity (29); and with the low secondary structure of the
initial n terminus of  xxxg1250xxx  predicted previously (fig. 5) (30).
the results imply that the endogenous n terminus of kir6.0
must participate in a dynamic binding/unbinding reaction that
allows ntp to compete for a contact site(s).
the action of ntp was rapidly reversible, apparently diffusion-limited, and sequence-specific. a randomized peptide of

in this reference, partially purified preparations of the full-length c
terminus of  xxxg1250xxx  fused with gst were reported to facilitate the decay
of katp currents. we have not seen such an effect of our synthetic
peptides, including ctp, which contains residues postulated to bind
phosphatidylinositol bisphosphate.

the smaller reverse effect on the ⌬nkatp versus intact channels
would be consistent with the lower coupling efficiency of the isolated
peptide versus the endogenous n terminus.

fig. 5. cytoplasmic view of one of four functional units of a
closed  xxxg1253xxx . the arrangement of the tmd1-nbd1-tmd2nbd2 core of  xxxg19xxx  (in light gray) and the m1-h5-m2 portion of kir6.0
is based on the architecture of “relaxed” btucd (39), the msba dimer,
a homolog of mdr atp-binding cassette transporters (38), and the
kcsa channel (45) in a “straight” conformation (49), respectively. the
overall shape of sur is consistent with electron microscopic projection
maps of relaxed mrp1 (46). the ␣-helical extensions of m1 and m2 are
based on secondary structure predictions (see “experimental procedures”); an extended inner helix of  xxxg1250xxx  is consistent with experimental data (47). the white circle and square indicate arg51 (arg50) and
arg195 (lys185), respectively (numbers for  xxxg1250xxx  are in parentheses).
the white triangle indicates ile192 (ile182) (48). the white star is gly343
(gly334) in the -phe-gly-asn-thr-(val/ile)-lys- motif recognizing atp
in ion-motive atpases, and g334d is the most potent in increasing the
ic50(atp) without affecting the po(max) (ref. 13; and a. p. babenko and
j. bryan, unpublished data). the putative atp inhibitory site(s) is
conserved in kir6.1- and  xxxg1250xxx -based channels (19). although the
reported effects of ntp and the ⌬n32 deletion could be explained by
indirect functional interactions involving l0 of sur and the initial n
terminus of kir6.0, we favor the idea that the two domains contact each
other to destabilize burst and to stabilize interburst conformation(s).
deletion of the first half of the n terminus eliminates the effects of l0
on the slow, cytoplasmic gating machinery of kir6.0. to accommodate
the results with ntp, we propose that the initial part of the kir n
terminus is somewhat flexible and that its association with l0 is dynamic. 125i-azidoglibenclamide (125i-n3glb), which photolabels both
subunits, defines a zone of proximity between l0 and the kir n terminus. we recognize that loss of labeling of ⌬ xxxg2242xxx  does not prove that the
distal n terminus is the labeling site; truncation could reposition part of
kir6.0 normally in proximity to l0 and the benzoido moiety of 125iazidoglibenclamide. the placement of the elements of the model suggests that binding of  xxxd2215xxx  could alter the positioning of l0 and
consequently lock kir in a closed state by repositioning its n terminus.

equivalent amino acid composition, solubility, and charge had
no effect. there was no binding of atp or sulfonylureas to ntp,
which could explain its effects on the ligand inhibition of katp
channels. ntp increases the po(max) under conditions (i.e. the
absence of atp) in which only a decrease in membrane phosphatidylinositol bisphosphate content is possible and could contribute to a slow rundown of channel activity (31). thus, although ntp has multiple positively charged residues, it does
not appear to act by neutralizing or screening negatively
charged membrane phospholipids postulated to stabilize an
atp-insensitive open state of the inner gate of  xxxg1250xxx  independently of sur (32).6 therefore, modulation of katp channels by ntp appears to reflect competition for a cytoplasmic site
on the kir6.0/ xxxg19xxx  complex.
several pieces of evidence suggest that the initial n terminus
and a segment more proximal to m1 may interact with distinct
cytoplasmic parts of the  xxxg1250xxx / xxxg19xxx  complex. the gain of
po(max) determined for katp channels with double versus single
r50q and k185q mutations first suggested that the proximal
n- and c-terminal domains are close to each other (12).4 a
fusion protein consisting of the first 53 residues from the n
terminus of  xxxg1250xxx  linked to gst pulled down a c-terminal
 xxxg1250xxx  fragment (residues 170 –391) (22). based on the patterns of interaction of a series of shorter overlapping n terminus-gst fusion proteins with the c-terminal fragment, this
approach suggested that amino acid segment 30 – 46 was necessary for stable interaction (note, however, that ⌬n32kir6.2
and ⌬n44kir6.2 readily co-assemble with  xxxg19xxx  functional
channels (12, 18)). a similar approach delineated several segments of the c terminus (33) as candidates for interaction with
the proximal n terminus (including arg50), and one of these
segments (residues 170 –204) includes lys185. an earlier analysis (20) of chimeric kir6.1⬃ xxxg1250xxx / xxxg19xxx  channels carrying
overlapping segments of kir n and c termini implicated amino
acids 37– 45 in controlling “spontaneous bursting” and implicated a single segment in the c terminus distinct from that
delineated by the gst fusion protein method. although these
approaches imply the participation of a common proximal nterminal segment in stable n/c-terminal associations, they
have uncovered no specific interactions between the distal n
terminus and the c terminus of either kir6.1 or  xxxg1250xxx . we
hypothesize that the sur-dependent modulation of katp channels by ntp reflects a competition of ntp with the initial n
terminus of a closed kir for a cytoplasmic site on a relaxed,
non-stimulatory conformation of  xxxg19xxx . deletion of the n-terminal segment of kir6.1 equivalent to ntp destabilizes a permanently closed state of the kir6.1/sur complex. this implies
that the initial kir n terminus serves as an inhibitory linker
between sur and the cytoplasmic gate in both kndp and katp
channels (19). shorter n-terminal truncations or concatenation
of kir subunits, which could change the position or mobility of
the n terminus, produce partial effects (19). we propose that by
displacing the linker from sur, ntp interferes with its action
in intact channels while partially mimicking it and thus
slightly inhibiting ⌬ xxxg2242xxx  channels.7
what cytoplasmic domain(s) of  xxxg19xxx  is in proximity to the
distal kir n terminus? as illustrated in fig. 5, the potential
candidates are nucleotide-binding domains nbd1 and nbd2;
the c terminus; and several loops, including the ⬃100-residue-

coupling of the n terminus of kir6.0 to  xxxg19xxx 

stimulatory mg-adp/atp ratio and binds katp openers and
sur inhibitors (30), to changes in the po of the pore.8 previous
work has shown that deletion of the n-terminal linker does not
alter mg⫺ nucleotide-dependent stimulation of katp channels;
thus, we have argued that stimulatory and inhibitory signals
converge via separable structural paths on katp pores (19, 27,
30). the postulated contacts differentially colored in fig. 5
provide plausible structural pathways for these convergent
signals.

we do not propose that the rate of atp hydrolysis by  xxxg19xxx  is high
enough to directly determine the rate of initiation and termination of
bursts of the ␤-cell channels; the basal ‘catalytic‘ activity of  xxxg20xxx 
isoforms in muscle cell channels is expected to be even lower (discussed
in refs. 19 and 30). consistent with ref. 44, we expect that at physiologic [atp]i, nbd2 of sur can be occupied by atp in non-stimulated
kir6.0/sur complexes.

long l0 linker (14, 15, 34). mutations in the nucleotide-binding
folds do not alter the spontaneous bursting of katp channels or
their inhibition by nucleotides or sulfonylureas in the absence
of mg2⫹, suggesting that they are unlikely to affect gating
through contacts with the kir n terminus. similarly, mutations and truncations of the c terminus of  xxxg19xxx  (26, 35) do not
markedly alter the po(max) (⬃0.6) of  xxxg1250xxx / xxxg19xxx ⌬c channels,
indicating that this region is also an unlikely candidate. on the
other hand, there is growing evidence for intersubunit interactions involving the l0 linker of sur and the kir n terminus
that attenuate the po. analysis of  xxxg19xxx  and  xxxg20xxx  chimeras
identified the tmd0-l0 segment as a critical determinant of
the interburst kinetics (10) affected by deletion of the kir n
terminus (12, 19). the l0 sequences of  xxxg19xxx  and  xxxg20xxx  are not
identical, and their differential interaction with the kir n
terminus is consistent with these results. several lines of evidence suggest that the l0 linker and the distal kir n terminus
may be in close proximity. an ⬃50-kda fragment spanning the
tmd0-l0 segment is the site of photolabeling of  xxxg19xxx  with
125
i- xxxd2215xxx  (28), and the l0 linker (16) has been implicated, along with segment(s) of tmd2 (27, 36, 37), in the
high-affinity binding of  xxxd2215xxx . 125i-azidoglibenclamide
has been shown to co-photolabel kir6.0 subunits when they are
co-assembled with  xxxg19xxx  (2). deletion of the distal n terminus
of  xxxg1250xxx  uncouples sulfonylurea binding to  xxxg19xxx  from attenuation of the po(max) (27), concomitantly reducing co-photolabeling of ⌬nkir6.2 subunits by 125i-azidoglibenclamide (fig.
4). the results imply that the l0 linker and the distal n
terminus of kir6.0 are in proximity.
our working model is illustrated in fig. 5. kir/sur contacts
must exist that stabilize the transmembrane voltage-sensitive
open state of kir6.0 (9). vm-independent interactions at the
cytoplasmic face of a kir/sur complex destabilize the burst
state and stabilize interburst state(s) that can be “locked”
closed by inhibitory ligands. based on the proposed interactions between the kir n terminus and the  xxxg19xxx  l0 linker, we
hypothesize that a domain(s) of tmd0, preceding l0, is in
contact with the m1 helix and/or its submembrane extension
(consistent with ref. 11). work on mrp1 (17) has shown that
l0 interacts with the tmd1-nbd1-tmd2-nbd2 core and is
critical for transport function. however, no role for tmd0 has
been proposed; the addition of tmd0 or tmd0-l0 from mrp1
to  xxxg10xxx , the multidrug resistance transporter p-glycoprotein,
produced functional  xxxg10xxx -like chimeras. on the other hand,
 xxxg19xxx /mrp1 chimeras containing any of the tmds of mrp1
failed to stimulate the surface expression of  xxxg1250xxx  (11). we
hypothesize that tmd0 may play a role in the specific association of sur with kir6.0. in contrast to previous schemes in
which tmd0 is excluded from direct contact with the kir core
(11, 16), our model argues that this domain can interact with
kir6.0 independently of the mdr-like core, which is structurally related to the msba dimer (38) and btucd (39). this idea,
which we are currently testing, does not exclude additional
kir/sur contacts and is predicated based on the finding that
the stability of the open pore is markedly increased by association with surs through their transmembrane domain(s). we
placed the l0 linker and the kir n terminus in contact. this
positioning is consistent with the specification of the po(max) of
 xxxg1250xxx /sur isoforms by the tmd0-l0 segment (10), with the
attenuation of the maximal po by the initial kir n terminus,
with competition by ntp for a site on sur, and with labeling of
these segments by 125i-azidoglibenclamide. this model makes
the interesting prediction that the tmd0-l0 segment alone
may be able to associate with and modulate the po(max) of
kir6.0 pores. the model implies that tmd0 and l0 couple
conformational changes in the sur core, which senses the
