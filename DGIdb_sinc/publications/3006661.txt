the y-aminobutyrate/benzodiazepine-receptor complex has been purified from a triton x-100 extract of
crude synaptic membranes from pig cerebral cortex and cerebellum by a combination of affinity and
ion-exchange chromatography. [3h]flunitrazepam binding activity was purified 2200-fold from cortex with
an overall yield of 2%. the dissociation constants for the binding of [3h]muscimol and [3h]flunitrazepam
to the receptor complex were 14 + 3 nm and 14 + 2 nm respectively. the ratio of [3h]muscimol to
[3h]flunitrazepam binding sites was in the range 2.2-2.8. there appeared to be no selective inactivation of
either binding site during the purification procedure.  xxxd3215xxx /polyacrylamide-gel electrophoresis revealed two major polypeptides of mr 49000 and 55000 from both cortex and cerebellum. when
the receptor from cortex was photoaffinity labelled with [3h]flunitrazepam, radioactivity was incorporated
predominantly into the mr49 000 polypeptide, although some radioactivity was detectable in the mr-55 000
band. the cerebellar receptor was photoaffinity labelled on the 49000-mr polypeptide but not on the
polypeptide of mr 55 000. in addition, some radioactivity was detected in a minor polypeptide of mr 43000.
when purified in the presence of 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]propanesulphonate the same
major polypeptide components (mr 49000 and 55000) were isolated, but the receptor now retained its ability
to be modulated by  xxxd3183xxx  and by the anaesthetic propanidid.

introduction

y-aminobutyrate (gaba) is the principal inhibitory
neurotransmitter in the mammalian central nervous
system. a major class of gaba receptors are associated
with cl- ion channels which constitute part of a protein
complex containing 'receptor' sites for gaba, benzodiazepines, picrotoxinin and barbiturates (olsen, 1981;
turner & whittle, 1983). recently, there have been
several reports describing the purification of solubilized
gaba/benzodiazepine receptors by affinity chromatography using benzodiazepines as immobilized ligands
(martini et al., 1983; sigel et al., 1983; sigel & barnard,
1984; taguchi & kuriyama, 1984). although, in all
reports, gaba- and benzodiazepine-receptor-binding
activities were found to co-purify, different preparations
have displayed differences in subunit composition and
ratio of ligand binding sites. in addition, some of the
characteristic interactions between the recognition sites
of the membrane-bound receptor complex have been
reported to be retained after extraction and purification
in media containing triton x-100 (martini et al., 1983)
and chaps (sigel & barnard, 1984), but not  xxxd1835xxx /
triton x-100 (sigel et al., 1983). it would appear,
therefore, that the nature of the detergent used during
isolation is of critical importance to the binding
characteristics of the purified receptor complex. in this
respect, the ability of barbiturates to modulate ligand
binding to the receptor complex appears to be
particularly sensitive to the nature of the detergent used
for solubilization.
stimulation by barbiturates of solubilized gaba and
benzodiazepine receptor binding has been demonstrated

only after extraction of membranes with chaps
(stephenson & olsen, 1982). gaba receptor binding to
a chaps-solubilized preparation is also enhanced by the
anaesthetic propanidid [the preceding paper (kirkness &
turner, 1986)]. when the gaba/benzodiazepine receptor
was purified in the presence of chaps, pentobarbital
caused a weak stimulation of benzodiazepine binding,
although an effect on gaba receptor binding was not
reported (sigel & barnard, 1984).
although early studies indicated central-type benzodiazepine receptors existed in brain as an homogeneous
population (squires & braestrup, 1977), more recent
evidence obtained from ligand-displacement studies
(klepner et al., 1979; nielsen & braestrup, 1980) and
analysis by photoaffinity labelling (sieghart & karobath,
1980) has suggested the possibility of receptor subtypes.
the evidence supporting receptor heterogeneity can be
demonstrated in tissue from several brain regions,
including cortex and hippocampus, but not from
cerebellum. in the present paper we compare characteristics of the gaba/benzodiazepine receptor complex
isolated from both pig cerebral cortex and cerebellum
after solubilization and purification in the presence of
triton x-100. we have also examined the effects of
barbiturates and propanidid on gaba receptor binding
to a chaps-purified receptor preparation.

(amersham, bucks., u.k.), adipic acid dihydrazideagarose, chaps, l-a-lecithin (phosphatidylcholine),
muscimol and  xxxd3183xxx  were from sigma (poole,
dorset, u.k.). all other materials were purchased from
 xxxg257xxx , poole, dorset, u.k. propanidid and chlorazepate
were gifts from, respectively, bayer u.k. ltd. and
boehringer-ingelheim (u.k.); other benzodiazepine
compounds were donated by hoffman-la roche (basel,
switzerland).
preparation of solubilized receptor
pig brain was obtained fresh from a slaughterhouse
and the cortex or cerebellum removed, frozen and stored
at -70°c until use. soluble receptor was prepared
essentially as described previously (sigel & barnard,
1984) with the following alterations. washed membranes
were solubilized in 2% triton x-100, 5 mm-chaps or
25 mm-chaps/0.2% l-a-lecithin instead of the detergent
used in the previous procedure. the membrane suspension
was stirred with detergent for 30 min at 4 °c before
centrifugation at 140000 g for 1 h. the solubilized
receptor was prepared in media containing the proteinase
inhibitors edta (1 mm),  xxxd302xxx  (1 mm), phenylmethanesulphonyl fluoride (0.3 mm), bacitracin
(100 mg/litre) and trypsin inhibitors type 1i-s and 11-0
(10 mg/litre; sigma).
isolation of the receptor complex
affinity chromatography and ion-exchange chromatography were performed essentially as described
previously (sigel et al., 1983), with the following changes.
after application ofthe triton x- 1 00-solubilized receptor
complex to the affinity column, the column was washed
at 50 ml/h with 10 mm-potassium phosphate (ph 7.4)/
250 mm-kcl/2 mm-magnesium acetate/0. 1 mm-egta/
10% (w/v) sucrose/0.2 % (w/v) triton x-100 (800 ml).
all other steps were as previously described. receptor
preparations solubilized with 5 mm-chaps or 25 mmchaps/0.2 % l-a-lecithin were purified identically, except
that in all media used during purification, triton x-100
was replaced by 5 mm-chaps or 5 mm-chaps/0.05%

l-a-lecithin respectively.
binding assays
ligand binding to the solubilized receptor complex was
measured by a peg precipitation/sedimentation assay
(stephenson et al., 1982). the receptor complex was
diluted into an assay medium that contained 20 mmph 7.5,
100 mm-kcl,
phosphate,
potassium
0.1 mm-edta and either 0.1 % triton x-100 or
5 mm-chaps. unless stated otherwise, diluted receptor in
a total volume of 200,1 was incubated with 40 nm[3h]muscimol or 30 nm-[3h]flunitrazepam at 0 °c for 30
or 45 min respectively. non-specific binding was determined in the presence of 50 ,#m-muscimol or 30,tmflunitrazepam. after incubation, 3.300 (w/v) y-globulin
(15 xl), followed by 36% (w/v) peg (85 #1), both in assay
medium, were added and the assay tubes vortex-mixed
and centrifuged at 11000 g for 10 min. the pellets were
rinsed twice superficially with ice-cold buffer. rinsed
pellets were solubilized overnight in 0.3 ml of ncs tissue
solubilizer (amersham international) and counted for
radioactivity in 5 ml of scintillation fluid [0.5 % ppo (2,5diphenyloxazole) in toluene]. all points were from
experiments performed in triplicate. protein in the
samples was determined by a micro-lowry method using

e. f. kirkness and a. j. turner

bovine  xxxg124xxx  as standard (bensadoun &
weinstein, 1976).

photoaffinity labelling
photoaffinity labelling of the receptor complex was
performed by the method of mohler et al. (1980). purified
receptor complex (50 ,u; bmax = 60 pmol/ml for
[3h]flunitrazepam) was incubated with 70 nm-[3h]flunitrazepam in a total volume of 60 ,1 for 1 h at 0 'c.
it was then exposed to a u.v. light source (phillips tl
40w/08 tube) at a distance of 20 cm for 10 min at 0 'c.
flunitrazepam was then added to a final concentration
of 30,m and incubation continued for 1 h. a 60,u1
aliquot of 24% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid was added,
followed by incubation for 30 min at 0 'c and centrifugation at 11000 g for 10 min. the pellet was washed
twice with acetone (250 ,ul) and subjected to sds/polyacrylamide-gel electrophoresis as described below. a
control experiment included flunitrazepam (30 /tm)
before addition of [3h]flunitrazepam. after sds/polyacrylamide-gel electrophoresis, gels were treated with
ppo (skinner & griswold, 1983), dried and subjected to
fluorography at -70 'c on fuji rx film for 7 days.

sds/polyacrylamide-gel electrophoresis
samples were concentrated by precipitation in 12%
(w/v) trichloroacetic acid and washed twice with acetone.
precipitated protein was dissolved in sample buffer
containing 60 mm-tris/hci, ph 6.8, 2% (w/v) sds,
100% (w/v) glycerol, 10 mm-dithiothreitol and 0.01 %
(w/v) bromophenol blue, and heated for 2 min at 100 'c.
sds/polyacrylamide-gel electrophoresis was performed
with 1 mm-thick gels by using the system of laemmli
(1970) with a 7-17 % -(w/v)-polyacrylamide gradient.
gels were silver-stained by a modification of the method
of morrisey (1981) as described by sigel & barnard
(1984).
results
purification of the gaba/benzodiazepine-receptor
complex
the gaba/benzodiazepine-receptor complex was
purified from a triton x-100 extract of crude synaptic
membranes of pig cerebral cortex by affinity and
ion-exchange ch-romatography. table 1 lists the results
from a typical purification. [3h]flunitrazepam-binding
activity was purified 2200-fold with a yield of 2%. the
greatest loss of binding activity, as indicated by the yield
of [3h]muscimol binding activity (20% ), occurred during
the affinity-chromatography step. less than 15% of the
applied binding activities were detected in the run-through
and wash fractions, indicating that the low yield results
from either receptor inactivation or chlorazepate-resistant
binding of the receptor to the affinity column.

indicating no selective inactivation of either binding site
during the purification procedure.

effect on the binding of 10 nm-[3h]muscimol to the
purified receptor complex. in addition, benzodiazepine
binding at 1 nm-[3h]flunitrazepam was unaffected by the
addition of  xxxd3183xxx  (1 mm) or gaba (0.1 mm).

polypeptide composition and photoaffinity labelling of the

sds/polyacrylamide-gel electrophoresis ofthe purified
receptor showed the existence of two major bands with
i values 49000 and 55000 (fig. 2a). when labelled
mr
irreversibly with [3h]flunitrazepam after u.v. illumination
(fig. 2c), radioactivity was incorporated predominantly
into the mr-49000 polypeptide, although some radioactivity was also detectable in the mr-55000 band. the
receptor complex purified from cerebellum displayed a
similar polypeptide pattern (fig. 2b) to that derived from
cortex and incorporated radioactivity predominantly into
the mra49000 polypeptide (fig. 2d). no radioactivity
was incorporated into the mr-55000 band, although
traces were detected that correlated with a faint band at
mr 43 000. although the extent of incorporation into the
mr-43 000 band varied slightly between individual
preparations of cerebellar receptor, radioactivity was

barbiturates and the anaesthetic propanidid was found
after treatment of membranes with low concentrations of
chaps [the preceding paper (kirkness & turner, 1985)].
the gaba/benzodiazepine receptor was purified
essentially as before, but with 5 mm-chaps replacing
triton x-100 in all stages. the yield of purified receptor
protein obtained by this procedure was reduced to 25%
ofthat obtained before (table 3). this was principally due
to the low solubilizing power of 5 mm-chaps. when
membranes were solubilized with 25 mm-chaps/0.2%
l-a-lecithin and subsequently purified in the presence of
5 mm-chaps/0.05 % l-a-lecithin, the yield increased to
between 50 and 60% of that obtained by extraction and
purification in the presence of triton x-100.
table 3 also shows differences in the characteristics of
ligand binding to the receptor complex extracted by the
two detergents. at the concentration of ligand examined,
the ratio of [3h]muscimol to [3h]flunitrazepam specific
binding activity was in the range 1.9-2.8 (ten preparations)
after extraction with triton x-100, and 0.3-0.6 (four
preparations) after extraction with chaps. similar ratios
were found after purification of the receptor complex.
this decreased ratio, after extraction with chaps,
resulted principally from a substantial decrease in
[3h]muscimol specific binding activity.
stimulation of ligand binding to the chaps-purified
receptor complex
as shown in fig. 3, propanidid caused a concentrationdependent stimulation of [3h]muscimol binding to the
chaps-purified receptor complex. binding was stimulated
to a maximum of 138 % of control binding at the highest
concentration of propanidid examined (5 mm).
 xxxd3183xxx  at 1 mm also caused a stimulation of
[3h]muscimol binding to the chaps-purified preparation
(128%). in addition, the binding of 1 nm-[3h]flunitrazepam to this preparation was stimulated by 1 mmsecobarbital (118%) and 0.1 mm-gaba (125%). assay
conditions were as described in the legend to fig. 3. the
extent to which binding to the purified receptor was
stimulated was not affected by the concentration ofchaps
(5 or 25 mm) used to extract the receptor from the
membrane.
in agreement with a previous report (sigel & barnard,
1984), we found that sds/polyacrylamide-gel electrophoresis of the chaps-purified receptor produced a
polypeptide pattern similar to that isolated in media
containing triton x-100, with only two major bands, at
mr 49000 and 55000 (results not shown).

procedure can often affect the stability and ligand-binding
characteristics of the proteins involved. we have
examined properties of the gaba/benzodiazepine
receptor from pig cerebral cortex after purification from
triton x-100 and chaps detergent extracts.
differential solubilization of [3h]flunitrazepam- and
[3h]muscimol-binding activities (stephenson et al., 1982)
and of two types of benzodiazepine receptor (lo et al.,
1982) has been reported after treatment of brain
membranes with triton x-100. these properties could
explain the differences in ligand-binding characteristics
and subunit composition reported for the gaba/
benzodiazepine-receptor complex isolated from triton
x-100 extracts (martini et al., 1983) and from sodium
 xxxd1835xxx  extracts (sigel et al., 1983).

[3h]muscimol-binding activities solubilized with 2 %
triton x-100 were found to co-purify during affinity
chromatography and deae-cellulose chromatography.
the benzodiazepine-binding activity was enriched
2200-fold, with a maximum specific binding activity of
1.4 nmol/mg of protein. the purification procedure
caused little change in the affinity of ligand binding, and
the ratio of [3h]muscimol to [3h]flunitrazepam binding
sites in the purified preparation was similar to that
observed in the crude soluble extracts (table 2; lo et al.,
1983). martini et al. (1983) reported a ratio of
[3h]muscimol to [3h]flunitrazepam binding sites of
about 1 after isolation of the receptor in triton x-100.
we have observed a ratio (2.2-2.8) more consistent with
that reported by sigel et al. (1983) after purification in
triton x-100 from a sodium  xxxd1835xxx  extract
(3.5-3.8). this higher value may result from the greater
instability of benzodiazepine binding in the presence of
sodium  xxxd1835xxx  (stephenson et al., 1982).
the receptor complex from rat brain extracted and
isolated in triton x- 100 was reported to contain only one
subunit, of mr 60000 (martini et al., 1983). more recent
reports suggest that the receptor is comprised of two
polypeptides, of mr 53000 and 57000 (bovine and rat
brain; sigel et al., 1983; sigel & barnard, 1984) or mr
48500 and 54500 (rat brain; taguchi & kuriyama, 1984).
we have also observed two major bands (mr 49000 and
55000) after sds/polyacrylamide-gel electrophoresis of
the receptor purified from pig cortex or cerebellum. the
mr-55000 band appeared slightly diffuse and may
represent a doublet.
photoaffinity labelling of the receptor complex purified
from cortex resulted in predominant incorporation of
radioactivity into the mr-49 000 band, although some
radioactivity was also detectable in the mr-55000
polypeptide. a similar distribution was reported after
labelling ofthe receptor purified from bovine cortex (sigel
et al., 1983). in contrast, no radioactivity was incorporated
into the mr-55 000 band from cerebellum, although traces
were detected at mra43 000, corresponding to a band that
stained weakly for protein (fig. 2d). although this
difference in labelling may result from differential
proteolytic action on the receptor preparations from the

e. f. kirkness and a. j. turner

two brain regions, it is consistent with several lines of
evidence suggesting heterogeneity in central-type benzodiazepine receptors. the triazolopyridazine cl218872
can interact with benzodiazepine receptors in a number
of brain regions, in a manner suggesting receptor
heterogeneity or negative cooperativity (squires et al.,
1979; klepner et al., 1979). from these studies, multiple
benzodiazepine receptors were predicted in cortex and
hippocampus, but not cerebellum. corresponding results
have been obtained from experiments employing photoaffinity labelling of membrane-bound benzodiazepine
receptors. by using membrane preparations from
cerebellum, [3h]flunitrazepam was irreversibly incorporated into a single polypeptide (mr 51 000), whereas in
other brain areas, additional polypeptides (mr 53000,
55000 and 57000) were also labelled (sieghart &
karobath, 1980; sieghart & drexler, 1983). we have
shown that this characteristic is retained in purified
preparations of receptor. the difference in labelling of the
purified receptor from cortex and cerebellium may result
from heterogeneity in the mr-55000 subunits. alternatively, regional differences in receptor conformation may
permit non-specific labelling of the mr-55000 band in
cortex but not in cerebellum.
the ability of barbiturates and propanidid to stimulate
solubilized [3h]muscimol-binding activity was found to
be optimal after extraction from membranes with low
concentrations of chaps (kirkness & turner, 1986).
[3h]muscimol binding to the gaba/benzodiazepine
receptor extracted and purified in the presence of
5 mm-chaps retained its sensitivity to these anaesthetic
agents. the extent ofmaximum enhancement is relatively
low (135-140%) compared with the effect in crude
solubilized and membrane preparations (kirkness &
turner, 1986), indicating partial inactivation of the effect
during isolation. in agreement with sigel & barnard
(1984), [3h]flunitrazepam binding to a chaps-purified
receptor preparation was also weakly stimulated by
 xxxd3183xxx  and gaba. increasing the concentration of
chaps used to extract the receptor from the membranes
to 25 mm approximately doubled the yield of purified
receptor, but did not affect the ability of  xxxd3183xxx  and
propanidid to enhance ligand binding. the relatively
rapid exchange of 25 mm-chaps for 5 mm-chaps in the
affinity column wash may prevent the apparent inhibitory
effect of high chaps concentrations on barbiturate
sensitivity (kirkness & turner, 1986).
a comparison of receptor preparations isolated; in
triton x-100 or chaps shows that the ratio of
[3h]muscimol to [3h]flunitrazepam binding was much
reduced after purification with chaps. although the
specific binding of both ligands was lower, [3h]muscimol
binding was reduced to a much greater extent (table 3).
the chaps-purified preparation displayed no differences
in polypeptide composition from that of the preparation
isolated in triton x-100, indicating that the differences in
[3h]muscimol binding and responsiveness to barbiturates
(and propanidid) may result from differences in receptor
conformation after isolation by the different procedures.
treatment of membranes with low concentrations of
triton x-100 has been shown to cause considerable
activation of gaba receptor binding (enna & snyder,
1977; chiu & rosenburg, 1979). in addition, studies with
the purified receptor indicate that activation is caused by
conversion of [3h]muscimol binding sites from low to
high affinity (sigel & barnard, 1984). triton x-100 binds
received 1 july 1985; accepted 13 september 1985

very tightly to proteins and may displace receptor-bound
phospholipids that could play an important role in the
interactions between the recognition sites of the receptor
complex. a possible involvement of lipid components in
the interactions is suggested by the observation that the
potency of a series of barbiturates to enhance gaba
(whittle & turner, 1982; olsen & snowman, 1982) and
benzodiazepine (leeb-lundberg & olsen, 1982) binding
to membranes correlates well with their lipid solubility.
propanidid is also highly-lipid-soluble. the stereospecificity of the interaction of some barbiturates with
receptor binding would, however, suggest that protein
interactions may also be involved (olsen & snowman,
1982).
by using a chaps-purified receptor preparation, in
which interactions between the various recognition sites
can be demonstrated, it may be possible to obtain a better
understanding of the molecular interactions underlying
regulation at the gaba synapse.
