abstract

purpose: prostatic dihydrotestosterone (dht) concentration is regulated by precursors from
systemic circulation and prostatic enzymes of androgen metabolism, particularly 5a-reductases
(i.e.,  xxxg2199xxx  and  xxxg2200xxx ). therefore, the levels of expression  xxxg2199xxx  and  xxxg2200xxx  and the
antiprostatic cancer growth response to finasteride, a selective  xxxg2200xxx  inhibitor, versus the dual
srd5a1and  xxxg2200xxx  inhibitor, dutasteride, were compared.
experimental design: real-time pcr and enzymatic assays were used to determine the levels
of srd5a1and  xxxg2200xxx  in normal versus malignant rat and human prostatic tissues. rats bearing
the dunning r-3327h rat prostate cancer and nude mice bearing lncap or pc-3 human prostate
cancer xenografts were used as model systems. tissue levels of testosterone and dht were
determined using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry.
results: prostate cancer cells express undetectable to low levels of  xxxg2200xxx  but elevated levels
of srd5a1activity compared with nonmalignant prostatic tissue. daily oral treatment of rats with
the  xxxg2200xxx  selective inhibitor, finasteride, reduces prostate weight and dhtcontent but did not
inhibit r-3327h rat prostate cancer growth or dhtcontent in intact (i.e., noncastrated) male rats.
in contrast, daily oral treatment with even a low 1mg/kg/d dose of the dual srd5a1and  xxxg2200xxx 
inhibitor, dutasteride, reduces both normal prostate and h tumor dhtcontent and weight in intact
rats while elevating tissue testosterone. daily oral treatment with finasteride significantly
(p < 0.05) inhibits growth of lncap human prostate cancer xenografts in intact male nude mice,
but this inhibition is not as great as that by equimolar oral dosing with dutasteride. this anticancer
efficacy is not equivalent, however, to that produced by castration. only combination of dutasteride and castration produces a greater tumor inhibition (p < 0.05) than castration monotherapy
against androgen-responsive lncap cancers. in contrast, no response was induced by dutasteride in nude mice bearing androgen-independent pc-3 human prostatic cancer xenografts.
conclusions: these results document that testosterone is not as potent as dht but does stimulate prostate cancer growth, thus combining castration with dutasteride enhances therapeutic
efficacy.

dihydrotestosterone (dht) is the major intracellular growth
factor for normal and neoplastic prostatic epithelial cells due to
its high-affinity binding to androgen receptors (ar; ref. 1). the
intracellular dht concentration determines the prostatic cell
content via its ability to regulate the proportion of ligandoccupied ar (2, 3). once a critical threshold of ar is occupied
by dht, signal transduction pathways are activated which
control the growth and functional activities of the prostatic
epithelium (1, 3). the intracellular dht concentration is thus
paramount and regulated by both the supply of testosterone

and other precursors from the systemic circulation and the
complex interplay between intracellular prostatic enzymes of
androgen metabolism, particularly the 5a-reductase (i.e.,
srd5a) family of reductive enzymes that irreversibly convert
testosterone into dht (4). the srd5a family includes two
isoforms each encoded by a distinct gene (5).  xxxg2199xxx  (i.e., 5areductase type i) is expressed widely and is the major isoform
expressed in tissues, such as liver and skin (5). distinguishing
characteristics of this type i isoform are its neutral (i.e., ph 7.0)
optima and high (i.e., micromolar) k m for testosterone (5).
 xxxg2200xxx  (i.e., the type ii isoform) is more restrictive in its
expression, being the major isoform expressed by male sex
accessory tissues, such as the prostate (5). distinguishing
characteristics of this type i isoform are its acidic (i.e., ph
5.0) optima and low (i.e., nmol/l) k m for testosterone (5).
whereas the major isoform expressed in the prostate stroma
is  xxxg2200xxx , normal and malignant prostate epithelial cells
express  xxxg2199xxx  (5). thus, dht concentration in normal and
neoplastic prostatic tissue is effected by varying inputs from
both  xxxg2199xxx  and  xxxg2200xxx  isoforms.
a greater degree of suppression of the intracellular dht
concentration is required to inhibit the growth of malignant
versus nonmalignant prostatic epithelial cells (2, 3, 6, 7). thus,

5a-reductase inhibitors and prostate cancer

regimens that lower dht concentrations sufficiently to
decrease prostatic size and cellular content in nonmalignant
prostatic tissue may not be adequate for therapeutic efficacy
against prostate cancer. there are a variety of clinically
approved methods for lowering tissue dht, including luteinizing hormone – releasing hormone analogues, to suppress the
systemic testosterone level as well as 5a-reductase inhibitors.
because 5a-reductase inhibitors do not inhibit the systemic
testosterone level but instead target the production of dht
by srd5a, their use as monotherapy was developed to allow
selective tissue dht suppression while maintaining or even
enhancing tissue testosterone levels. in this way, the anabolic
effects of testosterone on bone density, libido, and muscle mass
are preserved while blocking pathologic growth-promoting
effects of dht.
based on this rationale, orally active, steroidal 5a-reductase
inhibitors, such as epristeride (8 – 11), finasteride (12 – 14),
and dutasteride (refs. 14, 15; table 1), were developed. at
appropriate oral dose regimens, these agents lower dht
concentration sufficiently within prostates with benign prostatic hyperplasia to decrease gland size and relieve obstructive
symptoms (16 – 20). based on these results, finasteride and
dutasteride are approved by the food and drug administration
for benign prostatic hyperplasia treatment. in addition,
finasteride was the first 5a-reductase inhibitor tested as
monotherapy for metastatic prostate cancer. the clinical
efficacy of finasteride monotherapy in metastatic patients has
been modest (21, 22). the reason for the limited effectiveness
of finasteride may be due to the fact that although being a
potent (i.e., ic50, 69 nmol/l), time-dependent, irreversible
inhibitor of the human  xxxg2200xxx  it is not as potent (i.e., ic50,
360 nmol/l) or is not an irreversible inhibitor of the human
 xxxg2199xxx  isoform (refs. 23, 24; table 1). at clinical oral doses of
5 to 10 mg/d, maximum serum levels of finasteride are <200
nmol/l (13), which although above the ic50 for  xxxg2200xxx  is
below its ic50 for the  xxxg2199xxx  isoform. coupling this with its
short serum half-life (table 1) due to cytochrome p450 –
mediated oxidation of its t-butyl moiety (25) and its 82%

binding to serum proteins (23) results in finasteride functionally being a  xxxg2200xxx -specific inhibitor (24). human prostate
cancers down-regulate their expression of  xxxg2200xxx  isoform
while maintaining or even enhancing their expression of the
 xxxg2199xxx  isoform (26 – 30). this raises the issue of whether a
dual  xxxg2199xxx  and  xxxg2200xxx  inhibitor would be superior to
inhibition of just the  xxxg2200xxx  isoform when treating such
prostate cancer patients.
this possibility is supported by previous animal studies.
oral treatment of syngeneic copenhagen male rats bearing
androgen-responsive r-3327g rat prostatic cancers with the
5a-reductase inhibitor, epristeride, results in significant
reduction of both g tumor growth and ventral prostatic
(vp) cell content (i.e., 50% of the reduction in g tumor size
and vp cell content produced by castration; ref. 7). this
response correlated with suppression of dht concentration in
both g tumors and vp (7). likewise, oral treatment with
epristeride to nude mice bearing androgen-responsive pc-82
human prostate cancer xenografts results in tumor growth
inhibition nearly identical to that produced by surgical
castration (7). this growth inhibition in the pc-82 human
cancers occurs, although such epristeride treatment elevated
the pc-82 tumor testosterone concentration by 2-fold while
lowering pc-82 tumor dht concentration by 4-fold (7).
these results documented that growth of prostate cancers are
driven more by the concentration of tissue dht than
testosterone. this is consistent with dht having a >10-fold
higher potency for inducing ar signaling compared with
testosterone (31). in contrast to this robust response of g and
pc-82 prostate cancers, when rats bearing the androgenresponsive r-3327h rat prostate cancer are treated with a
similar epristeride oral dose regimen, normal vp cell and dht
content is reduced but no inhibition of h tumor growth
occurs and this inability is associated with a lack of
suppression of h tumor 5a-reductase activity and dht
concentration (7). a similar inability to either inhibit h
tumor growth or lower h tumor dht concentration occurred
when tumor-bearing rats were treated daily orally with

finasteride at a dose that reduced normal vp cell and dht
content (7, 32). these results document that h tumors express
srd5a activity not inhibited by type 2 specific inhibitors.
the 5a-reductase inhibitor, dutasteride, is identical to
finasteride, except in position 17 (table 1). in dutasteride, the
carbamoyl group at position 17 is coupled to a bis(trifluoromethyl)-phenyl moiety instead of a t-butyl moiety. this
modification shifts the serum half-life and increases the
inhibition potency of dutasteride as a reversible  xxxg2199xxx 
inhibitor and a time-dependent, irreversible  xxxg2200xxx  inhibitor
(ref. 23; table 1). due to its longer serum half-life and lower
ic50 for both  xxxg2199xxx  and  xxxg2200xxx  (table 1), dutasteride at
clinical oral doses of 5 mg/d, which produces steady-state
serum drug levels of z1 amol/l (20), is a dual 5a-reductase
inhibitor. therefore, a series of models were used to determine
whether there is an enhanced efficacy when dutasteride is used
to inhibit both  xxxg2199xxx  and  xxxg2200xxx  for the treatment of
prostate cancer.

materials and methods
reagents. the 5a-reductase inhibitor dutasteride [17h-n-(2,5-bis
(trifluoromethyl)phenyl-carbamoyl)-4-aza-5a-androst-1-en-3-one] was
provided by glaxosmithkline (research triangle park, nc), and
finasteride [17h-(n-tert-butylcarbamoyl)-4-aza-5a-androst-1-en-3-one]
was obtained from kemprotec ltd. (middlesbrough, united kingdom).
for oral dosing, animals received daily gavage with 200 al polyethylene
glycol 400/1% tween 80 (sigma; st. louis, mo) as vehicle containing
indicated dose of drug.
tissues, tumors, and cell lines. nonmalignant human prostate tissue
was obtained from radical prostatectomy specimens from seven
patients undergoing surgery for localized prostate cancer under an
institutional review board – approved protocol. the rat tumors used
(i.e., h and g sublines) are members of the dunning r-3327 system of
serially transplantable rat prostatic cancers whose developmental
history and characteristics have been described (33). the source and
characteristics for all of the normal and malignant human prostate cell
lines used have been described (34, 35). in vitro growth responses
to various agents was determined using a 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay as described (35).
real-time taqman reverse transcription-pcr quantitation of  xxxg2199xxx 
and  xxxg2200xxx  expression. the taqman primers and probes for human
and rat  xxxg2199xxx  and  xxxg2200xxx  genes were purchased from applied
biosystems (foster city, ca). total rna was extracted with qiagen
rneasy mini kit (qiagen, valencia, ca) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. the reverse transcription and subsequent polymerase
reactions were done using appropriate taqman reagents and protocol
using a bio-rad icycler (bio-rad, hercules, ca). each reverse
transcription-pcr experiment included a standard curve of known
copy number using full-length wild-type cdna of  xxxg2199xxx  and
 xxxg2200xxx  for either rat or human subcloned into the ta-cloning vector
(invitrogen, carlsbad, ca). using the appropriate species-specific
primers and copy number standards,  xxxg2199xxx  and  xxxg2200xxx  mrna
levels in the rat or human tissues were determined and expressed in
copy number per microgram of total rna.
5a-reductase enzymatic assays. the determination of  xxxg2199xxx  and
 xxxg2200xxx  isoform-specific enzymatic activities was achieved by subtracting the  xxxg2199xxx  isoform-specific activity from the total 5a-reductase
activity for each tissue. the  xxxg2199xxx  isoform-specific activity was
determined by irreversibly inhibiting the  xxxg2200xxx  activity selectively
within tissue homogenates using a preincubation step with nadph in
the presence of finasteride at a concentration of 5 nmol/l for rodent
tissues or 100 nmol/l for human tissues. this assay is based on the
studies of azzolina et al., which documented that within 1 hour of

clin cancer res 2006;12(13) july 1, 2006

incubation with 0.5 mmol/l nadph and these concentrations of
finasteride,  xxxg2200xxx  isoform is completely and irreversibly inhibited
(36). in addition, this group documented that the subsequent dilution
of finasteride to 0.5 nmol/l for rat tissues and 10 nmol/l for human
tissue does not allow reactivation of the inhibited  xxxg2200xxx  isoform but
is too low a concentration to inhibit the  xxxg2199xxx  isoform (36). based
on these results, 1:1 wet weight/volume whole (unfractionated) cell
homogenates were produced with an all-glass tissue homogenizer
(kontes, inc., vineland, nj) using 0.1 mol/l sodium phosphate
(ph 6.6) containing 0.5 mmol/l nadph (i.e., h buffer). two separate
100 al aliquots were processed: (a) with no finasteride pretreatment for
the determination of the total 5a-reductase (i.e.,  xxxg2199xxx  plus  xxxg2200xxx )
activity and (b) with a 1-hour finasteride (i.e., 5 nmol/l for rat tissues or
100 nmol/l for human tissues) and 0.5 mmol/l nadph preincubation
at 37jc for the selective determination of  xxxg2199xxx  only. both of the
aliquots were then diluted with the addition of 400 al h buffer. a
100 al aliquot for each of these diluted mixtures was then incubated
at 37jc with 100 al h buffer containing 0.5 mmol/l nadph and
0.1 amol/l [3h]testosterone (amersham; piscataway, nj; specific
activity, 50 ci/mmol) to give a final concentration of 0.5 mmol/l
nadph and 50 nmol/l testosterone. at 30 and 60 minutes, 30 al of the
mixtures were processed by tlc to determine the picomoles of 5areduced products found per hour per 108 cells as described previously (7).
animal studies. all animals used in these studies were maintained
in accordance with the nih guide for the care and use of laboratory
animals and the specific protocols used were approved by the johns
hopkins medical institutions animal care and use committee. adult
male inbred copenhagen rats (175-200 g body weight) were used for
serial passage of the r-3327h and r-3327g rat prostatic cancer lines
and 4- to 6-week-old male athymic nude balb/c nu/nu mice were used
for passage of the pc-82, lncap, and pc-3 human prostate cancer
variants as described previously (7). all animals were obtained from
harlan sprague-dawley (indianapolis, in).
for the testing of the in vivo antitumor growth response of dunning
r-3327h rat prostatic cancers to 5a-reductase inhibitors, copenhagen
male rats were inoculated s.c. in the flank with 20 mg minced h tumor
in 0.5 ml matrigel (collaborative biomedical, bedford, ma). when the
h tumors reached 1 to 2 cm3 in size, randomization was done into
groups of 10 tumor-bearing animals each and the groups were given
various treatments. tumor volumes were recorded each 5 to 7 days
using microcalipers to determine the volume of the tumors as described
previously (7). after 55 days of treatment, blood was drawn and vp and
h tumors were removed and weighed.
for testing against the lncap and pc-3 human prostate cancer, male
nude mice were inoculated in the flank with 200 al matrigel containing
2  106 viable lncap or pc-3 cells harvested from exponentially
growing in vitro cultures. when the tumors reached a starting size of
100 mm3, randomization was done into groups of 10 tumor-bearing
animals each and the groups were given various treatments. after the
indicated time of treatment, the tumor weights were determined for
each animal.
serum and tissue dht and testosterone determination. the blood
and tissues were extracted and extracts were assayed for determination
of their testosterone and dht levels using a validated tandem mass
spectrometry method by ppd-pharmaco (richmond, va).
statistical analysis. data (mean f se) were analyzed by one-way
anova. p < 0.05 is considered significant.

normal human prostatic cell lines (i.e., htert, rwpe-1, and
hpr-ar) at levels comparable with that expressed by normal
human prostatic tissue (fig. 1b). although  xxxg2199xxx  mrna is
expressed in all malignant human (i.e., pc-3, cwr22rv1, mdapc-2b, c4-2b, du145, lapc-4, pc-82, or lncap; fig. 1b) and
rat (i.e., h and g; fig. 1c) prostate cancer variants, expression
is significantly elevated in several of these (i.e., mda-pc-2b and
lapc-4 human and h rat prostatic cancer). in contrast, normal
rat and human prostatic tissues and h and g rat prostate cancer
tissues contain detectable levels of  xxxg2200xxx , whereas none of
the human normal or malignant cell lines do. this is because
these tissue samples, unlike the cell lines, contain supporting
host stromal cells and such stromal cells express  xxxg2200xxx  (5).
as further documentation that the  xxxg2200xxx  mrna level
detectable from tissue samples is derived from contaminating
stromal not epithelial cells, reverse transcription-pcr analysis
was done on a pure population of g rat prostate cancer cell
line exponentially growing in cell culture. when these in vitro
cultured g cells were analyzed for  xxxg2199xxx  and  xxxg2200xxx 
expression, the level of  xxxg2199xxx  mrna remains high, whereas
 xxxg2200xxx  is undetectable.

mrna results document that the  xxxg2199xxx  is the major, if not
exclusive, isoform expressed by malignant rat and human

prostate cancer cells. previous studies showed that srd5a
mrna levels are correlated with 5a-reductase activity (37, 38).
in these previous studies, the 5a-reductase enzymatic assays
were done at both acidic and neutral ph in an attempt to
evaluate the activity associated with  xxxg2199xxx  versus  xxxg2200xxx 
isoforms. unfortunately, smith et al. (39) documented that the
ph profile of the  xxxg2199xxx  versus  xxxg2200xxx  is both too broad and
varies depending on the concentration of testosterone used
in the assay [i.e., at 20 nmol/l testosterone concentration,
 xxxg2200xxx  has a ph 5.0 (optima) that is shifted to an optima
at ph 6.5 at 1 amol/l testosterone concentration] to allow
accurate determination based on ph alone. an accurate
determination of the isoform-specific activities is possible if a
preincubation treatment with the appropriate concentration of
finasteride is used to selectively, and irreversibly, inhibit
 xxxg2200xxx  activity so that the  xxxg2199xxx  isoform-specific activity
can be accurately determined. by subtracting this  xxxg2199xxx 
isoform-specific activity from the total (i.e.,  xxxg2199xxx  +
 xxxg2200xxx ) activity assayed without finasteride treatment, the
 xxxg2200xxx  isoform-specific activity can be determined.
using this method, the  xxxg2199xxx  or  xxxg2200xxx  activity was
determined from a series of normal or malignant rat and
human prostatic tissues harvested directly from their host
without cell culturing. these results documented that the level
of  xxxg2200xxx  enzymatic activity is >10-fold higher than  xxxg2199xxx 
enzymatic activity in the normal rat vp (table 2). these
enzymatic activity differences are thus higher than predicted by
the 2-fold difference in mrna expression (fig. 1a). in contrast,
the  xxxg2200xxx  activity in the h and g rat prostate cancer tissues
derived from contaminating tumor stromal cells is >90%
reduced compared with normal rat prostate (table 2). again,
this is a greater reduction in activity than predicted by mrna
levels (fig. 1c). for the h rat prostate cancer, this reduction in
 xxxg2200xxx  activity is coupled to a >5-fold increase in  xxxg2199xxx 
activity (table 2), which is consistent with the comparative
mrna levels (fig. 1c). such an enhancement in  xxxg2199xxx 
activity was not observed for the g rat prostate cancer (table 2).
with regard to human tissues, the  xxxg2200xxx  activity is >10fold higher than  xxxg2199xxx  activity in nonmalignant human
prostate tissue (table 2), which is higher than predicted based
on mrna expression data (fig. 1a). both xenografted pc-82
and lncap tumor tissue express a low level of  xxxg2200xxx  activity

(table 2), derived from contaminating tumor stromal cells.
 xxxg2199xxx  activity was low in the pc-82 but elevated 2-fold in the
lncap prostate cancer tissue compared with nonmalignant
prostatic tissue (table 2).
pharmacologic basis for selective efficacy of finasteride and
dutasteride for normal rat prostate versus h rat prostate
cancer. because  xxxg2199xxx  enzymatic activity is high in the
r-3327h rat prostate cancer tissue and not in the normal rat
prostate, r-3322g rat prostate, or pc-82 human prostate cancer
(table 2), this could explain why finasteride suppress the tissue
dht concentration in these latter tissues but not in the
r-3327h rat prostate cancers. this suggests that a dual 5areductase inhibitor with a longer serum half-life and/or higher
potency is needed to suppress the dht concentration in
r-3327h rat prostatic cancers. therefore, rats s.c. bearing 1 to
2 cm3 r-3327h rat prostatic cancers were randomized into
receiving daily oral b.i.d. treatment with varying doses of either
finasteride or dutasteride and the effect on tumor volume was
monitored for 55 days of treatment. the choice of dose range
used is based on pharmacokinetic modeling that the nadir
level of serum finasteride produced by multiday oral dosing is
0.5 nmol/l at 0.7 mg/kg/d (i.e., 1.89 nmol/kg/d), 5.4 nmol/l at
7 mg/kg/d (i.e., 18.9 nmol/kg/d), and 54 nmol/l at 70 mg/kg/d
(i.e., 189 nmol/kg/d; ref. 22). due to its >10-fold longer halflife, similar pharmacokinetic modeling predicts the equimolar
dosing with dutasteride should produce nadir serum values of

 xxxd1891xxx  mg/kg/d (i.e., 18.9 nmol/kg/d), and 12.5 amol/l at 100
mg/kg/d (i.e., 189 nmol/kg/d; ref. 22). experimental confirmation of the accuracy of these modeling data is provided
by the observation that oral dosing of rats with 1 mg/kg/d
produced peak serum dutasteride levels of 263 nmol/l (40).
as controls, groups of h rat prostate cancer – bearing animals
were dosed b.i.d. orally with vehicle or surgically castrated and
then given oral dosing b.i.d. of vehicle. these studies document
that the r-3327h rat prostate cancer essentially stops growth
following surgical castration (fig. 2). this response to
castration is correlated with a >90% decrease in serum
testosterone and h tumor tissue concentration of both
testosterone and dht (table 3). likewise, the concentration
of testosterone and dht decreases by >90% within the vp of
such castrated animals. this is correlated with a 70% reduction
in the weight of the vp of the castrated animals. treatment with
finasteride, even at doses of 70 mg/kg/d (189 nmol/kg/d),
is unable to decrease the growth of the h rat prostate cancers
(fig. 2) due to its inability to lower h tumor dht
concentration (table 3). in contrast to the situation for the h
tumor, the weight and dht concentration of vp, which
expresses only a low level of  xxxg2199xxx  (table 2), is significantly
decreased in these tumor-bearing rats treated with finasteride
(table 3). in fact, there is a dose-response relationship between
amount of finasteride and decreases in both prostatic weight
and prostatic dht concentration (table 3). when tumorbearing animals are treated with dutasteride, not only did the
vp weight decrease, but also there is also a significant decrease
in h tumor growth (fig. 2) and the tumor weight at the end of
55 days of treatment (table 3). this antitumor effect is
associated with a dose-response reduction in dht content
coupled with a >2-fold increase in serum testosterone and
tissue testosterone levels in both h tumor and vp (table 3).
once the dht content in the h tumor is reduced by 75% to 3

nmol/l by the lowest dosing of dutasteride, however, there is
no further anticancer growth inhibition produced by the higher
doses, although the highest dose reduces dht content by an
additional 90% (table 3). these results document that
although the highest dutasteride dose reduces h tumor dht
to the essential same nadir produced by castration it does not
produce the same magnitude of prostate cancer growth
inhibition. this is consistent with an elevated tumor testosterone level stimulating prostate cancer growth.
in vivo response of lncap human prostate cancer cells to 5areductase inhibition alone and in combination with androgen
ablation. based on the ability of testosterone to stimulate
prostate cancer growth, the efficacy of dual srd5a inhibition,
theoretically, should be enhanced by simultaneously lowering
the tumor testosterone levels by androgen ablation. as a model
system to evaluate this possibility, the lncap cell line was used
because it expresses 2-fold higher levels of both  xxxg2199xxx  mrna
(fig. 1b) and enzymatic activity compared with nonmalignant
human prostate tissue (table 2). in addition, growth of
established (i.e., 100 mm3) lncap prostate cancers in male
nude mice is profoundly inhibited by androgen ablation (i.e.,
castration) to lower serum and tumor testosterone levels
(fig. 3). therefore, intact male nude mice bearing (100 mm3)
lncap prostate cancers were left either intact or castrated and
treated for 28 days with equimolar daily oral dosing of
finasteride (i.e., 70 mg/kg/d b.i.d.) or dutasteride (i.e., 100
mg/kg/d b.i.d.; fig. 3). whereas finasteride significantly
decreases lncap prostate cancer growth, dutasteride is superior
in its anticancer efficacy at an equimolar dose. castration,
however, produces a greater reduction in subsequent lncap
cancer growth compared with either finasteride or dutasteride
monotherapy. as predicted, however, only the combination
of dutasteride treatment with castration produces a greater
(p < 0.05) tumor growth inhibition than castration monotherapy alone (fig. 3).

amol/l kills both ar-positive androgen-sensitive lncap and
ar-negative androgen-independent pc-3 cells in culture in a
manner not reversed by dht supplementation (41). because

the 100 mg/kg/d oral dose of dutasteride used for the lncap
model produces serum dutasteride levels of 12.5 amol/l (22),
this raises the issue of whether at this dose the efficacy of
dutasteride alone or in combination with androgen ablation
involves its specific ability to inhibit srd5a and/or a general
toxic effect on cell survival. to resolve this, intact male nude
mice were inoculated with pc-3 cells and allowed to go
untreated until the cancers reached 100 mm3 and then
randomized into four groups of 10 tumor-bearing mice each.
one group each was (a) given b.i.d. daily dosing with vehicle
only (i.e., intact controls), (b) given b.i.d. daily dosing with 100
mg/kg/d dutasteride, (c) castrated and given b.i.d. dosing with
vehicle (i.e., castrate controls), or (d) castrated and given b.i.d.
dosing with dutasteride. after 14 days of treatment, there
was no difference in the size of the pc-3 cancers in any of
the four groups (i.e., cancers were 395 f 20 mm3 in intact
controls, 375 f 45 mm3 in castrate controls, 410 f 39 mm3 in
intact mice given dutasteride, and 400 f 31 mm3 in castrated
mice given dutasteride). these results are consistent with a
requirement for the prostate cancer being ar positive and
sensitive to its signaling for it to be responsive to 100 ng/kg/d
dutasteride.

 xxxg2200xxx  enzymes in the prostate stroma produce an adequate
level of dht to occupy a sufficient number of ar within the
nuclei of prostate stromal cells to induce their production of a
critical level of specific paracrine peptide growth factors
(termed andromedins; refs. 1, 4). once formed in the stromal
compartment, these paracrine andromedins diffuse into the
epithelial compartment where they bind to their cognate
receptors in the basal and luminal cells regulating their
proliferation and survival, respectively (1, 4). if sufficient
inhibition of stromal  xxxg2200xxx  is produced to prevent
adequate production of dht and thus stromal andromedins,

discussion
the present studies showed that prostate cancer cells express
only a low level of  xxxg2200xxx  mrna and enzymatic activity but
often express enhanced levels of  xxxg2199xxx  activity compared
with nonmalignant prostate tissue. these observations have
significant implications for the use of 5a-reductase inhibitors
for prostate cancer. 5a-reductase inhibitors do not suppress
the systemic levels of testosterone and their long-term use
does not produce muscle, bone, or libido loss, although such
treatments lower prostatic dht inducing regression of
nonmalignant prostatic tissue (17, 19). these clinical observations document that regulation of nonmalignant prostatic
epithelial survival and proliferation is primarily driven by
prostatic dht and by not testosterone levels. this is because

cancer therapy: preclinical

then regression of the prostatic epithelium is induced (7). this
stromal-based paracrine ar axis in nonmalignant prostate
tissue explains why a  xxxg2200xxx  selective inhibitor, such as
finasteride, can produce nonmalignant prostatic regression
and can be used for treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia,
although it does not inhibit  xxxg2199xxx  expressed within
prostatic epithelial cells.
during prostatic carcinogenesis, molecular changes occur
producing a gain of function in the ar axis from a paracrine to
an autocrine pathway in which occupancy of the ar by dht
within the nuclei of malignant cells directly controls the
autocrine production of growth factors for survival and
proliferation of these malignant cells (1, 42). coupled with
these changes, there is enhanced expression of the  xxxg2199xxx 
isoform by prostate cancer cells, enhanced  xxxg2199xxx  expression
is consistent with why previous clinical trials with the srd5a2specific inhibitor, finasteride, for the treatment of metastatic
prostate cancer have had limited success either when used as
monotherapy (21, 22) or when combined with antiandrogens
(43). in the present studies, the dual  xxxg2199xxx  and  xxxg2200xxx 
inhibitor, dutasteride, has been documented to have enhanced
in vivo efficacy compared with a  xxxg2200xxx -specific inhibitor
against both rat and human prostate cancers. this efficacy is not
equivalent as monotherapy, however, to that produced by

standard androgen ablation alone. these results document that
although testosterone is not as potent as dht in driving
malignant growth it still does stimulate such growth. the
present experimental studies document that a combination of
dual  xxxg2199xxx  and  xxxg2200xxx  inhibition with standard androgen
ablation produces at least an additive antitumor growthinhibitory effect compared with either monotherapy alone.
the rationale for such an enhancement is that standard
androgen ablation decreases testicular testosterone production
but does not completely eliminate prostate cancer tissue
testosterone content (44). thus, in the androgen-depressed
environment induced by standard androgen ablation, local
5a-reduction within metastatic prostate cancer cells amplifies
the remaining androgen signal. such androgenic amplification
can be inhibited by simultaneous treatment with a dual 5areductase inhibitor, such as dutasteride. this dutasterideandrogen ablation combinational approach while limiting the
amplification of androgen does not eliminate all ar-dependent
signaling. this suggests that to block remaining ar growth
signaling a novel (i.e., ‘‘bulky’’) antiandrogen may need to be
added to the dutasteride-androgen ablation combination (45).
presently, we are developing such novel monofunctional and
bifunctional ‘‘bulky’’ antiandrogens for such combinatorial
ar-targeted therapy.
