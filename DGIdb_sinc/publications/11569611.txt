abstract—we investigated the ganglionic effects of  xxxg99xxx  (ang ii) and the signal transduction
involved in the cardiac sympathetic ganglia by the direct administration of agents to the ganglia through the
right subclavian artery and monitoring the heart rate as an indicator of the ganglionic function in pithed dogs.
ang ii given i.a. caused increases in the heart rate, which was inhibited by the treatment with the at1-receptor antagonist  xxxd2150xxx , but not by the  xxxg101xxx -receptor antagonist pd-123319. the stimulation by ang ii, but
not by acetylcholine, was inhibited after treatment with an inhibitor of phospholipase c, u-73122; a cellpermeant modulator of the ins(1,4,5)p3 receptors, 2-aminoethoxydiphenyl borate; an intracellular calcium
and calcium-associated protein kinase inhibitor,  xxxd2087xxx ; calmodulin (cam) inhibitor, w-7; ca2+/camdependent protein kinase ii inhibitor, kn-93; a selective protein kinase c inhibitor, calphostin c; and na+h+ exchange inhibitor, dimethylamiloride. these results suggest that ang ii stimulates the ganglionic transmission at postsynaptic sites via the activation of  xxxg100xxx  coupled to either activation of
phospholipase c, phosphoinositide hydrolysis and subsequent increase in intracellular ca2+ and activation of
protein kinase c and ca2+/ cam kinase ii, although this ganglionic stimulation seems to involve, at least in
part, the protein kinases-dependent increase of amiloride-sensitive na+ inflow.

a variety of peptides,  xxxg99xxx  (ang ii) and other
neuropeptides, have been identified in the ganglia by immunofluorescence. they appear to be localized to particular cell bodies, nerve fibers or sif cells; and they are
released upon nerve stimulation (1). it has been proposed
that  xxxg99xxx  (ao) mrna is located in both sensory
neural tissue as well as the sympathetic ganglia in the rat
(2). recently, we also demonstrated ao mrna to be located in the dog stellate and inferior cervical ganglia, while
preganglionic stimulation to the isolated ganglia released
endogenous ang ii to the incubation medium (3). based
on these findings, the angiotensin system may thus play an
independently important role in ganglionic transmission in
the sympathetic ganglia.
the octapeptide ang ii is well known to exert a wide
range of physiological effects on the cardiovascular, renal
and endocrine systems, as well as on the peripheral and
central nervous systems (4). the peptide is a potent stimu-

lant of the sympathetic ganglia by exerting its action directly
on the postganglionic cells in the superior cervical (5) and
the stellate ganglia (6, 7). specific binding sites for ang ii
have been shown to exist at multiple sites in the sympathetic nervous system, including the sympathetic stellate
and superior cervical ganglia (8), the brain (9) and the
adrenal medulla (10).
recent studies with non-peptide ang ii antagonists have
provided more definitive evidence for the existence of
ang ii receptor subtypes. ang ii receptors have thus been
divided into two subtypes, which are referred to as at1 and
 xxxg101xxx  (11).
as for the possible involvement of the signal transduction in ang ii responses, biochemical investigations have
also been done. based on the findings of such biochemical
studies, ang ii has been proposed to stimulate phospholipase c through a g-protein and accelerate the production
of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (ins(1,4,5)p3) as well as
diacylglycerol and the mobilization of intracellular ca2+ in
the vascular smooth muscle cells (12). ang ii has also been
reported to inhibit the adenylate cyclase-camp-dependent

protein kinase cascade through activation of the receptorcoupled g-protein gi in cultured rat heart (13). the rat
superior cervical ganglia also contain at1-type angiotensin
receptors, which are probably g-protein linked, and their
stimulation results in an increased inositol phospholipid
metabolism (14). however, there is little information on
the signal transduction pathways of the peptide in the
sympathetic ganglia provided by functional changes in the
innervated periferal organ. such in vivo experiments to
elucidate the participation in the signal transduction pathways involved are clinically significant.
in the present study, the effect of ang ii on the ganglionic
transmission and the possible involvement of signal transduction in this effect were investigated by utilizing changes
of heart rate as indicator of in vivo canine sympathetic
ganglionic function.
materials and methods
animal care
mongrel adult dogs of either sex, provided by the
fukuoka city animal control center, were kept for about
1 week in the facilities for experimental animals of
fukuoka university and during that time they underwent a
general medical examination. each dog was housed in an
individual cage located in a temperature-controlled room
(22°c) that was humidified (50 – 60%) and maintained on
a 12 h / 12 h light / dark cycle (8 am / 8 pm). all animals
had free access to water and were fed standard solid laboratory food (ed-1; sanwa chemicals, inc., tokyo), 300 g
/ animal per day. the experimental procedures were carried
out under protocols approved by the experimental animal
care and use committee of fukuoka university and the
japanese pharmacological society. the total number of
animals used in this experiment was 68 dogs.
surgical preparation
the dogs (6 – 12 kg) were anesthetized with 30 mg/ kg
of pentobarbital sodium administered intravenously (i.v.).
the trachea was cannulated and the animals put on a harvard
respirator (24 strokes/ min, 300 ml of tidal volume). to
eliminate reflex changes in the autonomic activity, both
vagus nerves were cut at the cervical region and both
carotid arteries were ligated. the spinal cord was severed
and then the brain was pithed with a steel rod through the
atlantooccipital foramen, while the foramen was thereafter
rapidly sealed with cork. the surgical procedures were
performed principally according to the methods described
by fleisch et al. (15). the chest was opened by severing
the upper three ribs, and the right internal mammary and
vertebral arteries were ligated. the right brachial artery
was cannulated with a polyethylene catheter connected to
a stopcock. the catheter was advanced proximally until the

tip was approximately at the junction of the right internal
mammary and subclavian artery and was then secured
tightly in place. the temperature in the area of the ganglia
was maintained at between 37°c and 38°c by a heat lamp
and a heating pad placed under the animal. the blood
pressure was measured with a pressure transducer (mpu0.5-290-11; nihon kohden co., tokyo) connected to a
cannula placed in the right femoral artery. the heart rate
as an indicator of the ganglionic function was recorded
continuously by a cardiotachograph (rt-45, nihon kohden)
triggered by the femoral arterial pulse wave. the output
signals from the pressure transducer and the cardiotachograph were both recorded on a polygraph (rbl-45, nihon
kohden). because the blood pressure decreased after the
spinal cord was severed, the pressure was thus maintained
at about 80 mmhg during the experiment by infusing
dextran (6% in saline contained 5% glucose) into the femoral vein, as previously described (15). all agents were
rapidly injected intraarterially (i.a.) at a volume of 0.1 to
0.2 ml through a catheter inserted in the subclavian artery.
the agents administered via the subclavian artery reached
the cardiac sympathetic ganglia and affected the peripheral
functions through the sympathetic system (15 – 17).
drug administration
the drugs to be systemically administered were injected
through a catheter inserted in the right femoral vein. as
postganglionic stimulants, acetylcholine (ach) and ang ii
were used in the present study. for dose-response studies
with ach and ang ii, the drugs were given in increasing
doses after a complete recovery from the preceding effect
in the respective groups of animals. to prevent tachyphylaxis from developing with the successive administration of ang ii, a 10-min interval was thus allowed between
each administration of ang ii, according to our previously
reported data (18, 19). the interval between two successive
dose-response runs for ang ii and ach were 60 min. as
for the drug pretreatment,  xxxd2150xxx , pd-123319, u-73122,
2-apb, w-7, kn-93, calphostin c,  xxxd2087xxx  and dimethylamiloride were administered i.a. in order to directly reach
the ganglia. according to our previous report (20) in which
3 min after the administration of the membrane permeable
antagonists were allowed to elapse before another doseresponse to ang ii, 3 min after the administration of these
antagonists in the present experiment, either ang ii or ach
were administered i.a.
drugs
the drugs used in this study were acetylcholine chloride
(daiichi pharmaceutical, tokyo);  xxxg99xxx  (protein
research foundation, osaka); nifedipine, 5-(n,n-dimethyl)amiloride (dimethylamiloride) and 2-aminoethoxydiphenyl
borate (2-apb) (sigma chemical co., st. louis, mo, usa);

(seikagaku kogyo co., tokyo); calphostin c (lc laboratories, new boston st. wobum, ma, usa); 9-(tetrahydro2-furyl)- xxxd79xxx  (sq-22536) and 1-[6-[[(17b)3-methoxyestra-1,3,5(10)-trien-17-yl]amino]hexyl]-1h-pyrrole-2,5-dione (u-73122) (research biochemicals international, natick, ma, usa). 5-[(3,5-dibutyl- xxxd17xxx )methyl]-2-[2-(1h-tetrazol-5-ylphenyl)]pyridine
( xxxd2150xxx ), 1-[[4-(dimethylamino)-3-methylphenyl]-methyl]-5-(diphenylacetyl)-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-1h-imidazo[4,5c]-pyridine-6-carboxylic acid, ditri-fluoroacetate, monohydrate (pd-123319) and 1-5-(isoquinolinesulfonyl)-homopiperazine ( xxxd2087xxx ) were generous gifts from searle
(skokie, il, usa), parke-davis (ann arbor, mi, usa)
and asahi chemical industry (tokyo), respectively. because of the poor solubility of calphostin c and nifedipine
in water, both 0.02 and 10 mg/ ml stock solutions of the
drugs were prepared with  xxxd102xxx , stored in a
freezer and at the time of administration, an aliquot of the
stock solutions was thus diluted with distilled water. the
maximum concentration of ethanol used (10%) at a volume
of 0.2 ml had no effect on the positive chronotropic effect
of the ganglionic stimulants in the cardiac sympathetic ganglia.  xxxd2150xxx  was dissolved in 0.05 n naoh and then
adjusted to within a range of ph 7 – 8 with 0.5 n hcl. all
other agents were dissolved in distilled water.
statistical analyses
the values are the mean ± s.e.m. the values between
more than two mean values of the dose-response run in
the same animals were evaluated by the dunnett test.

comparisons of the values before and after antagonists in
the same animals were assessed statistically by an analysis
of variance (anova) followed by the bonferroni multiple
comparison test. values of p<0.05 were considered to be
significantly different.
results
effects of  xxxd2150xxx  and pd-123319 on the positive chronotropic responses to ang ii
thirteen groups consisting of 4 – 7 dogs per group were
used in this study. the values of the mean basal blood
pressure and heart rate in all pithed animals before the
treatments were 87 ± 6.3 mmhg and 147 ± 16 beats/min,
respectively, (n = 120).
as shown in fig. 1, ang ii (0.1, 0.2, 0.4 mg) given to
the cardiac ganglia through the subclavian artery produced
a dose-dependent increase in the heart rate with a latency
of about 2 s. the peak effect was reached within 20 s and
the response lasted for 2 – 4 min, depending on the dose.
the dose-response run to ang ii was performed first. at 1,
2 and 3 h later, the dose-dependent effects of the peptide
showed not alteration, thus indicating that the effects were
quite reproducible (data not shown).
the dose-response to ang ii was unaffected by successive i.v. treatment with hexamethonium (10 mg / kg) and
atropine (0.1 mg /kg), the rate increase induced by a maximal dose of ang ii, 0.4 mg, being unaltered from the control of 42 ± 8.3 to 46 ± 7.6 beats /min after the treatment.
intraarterial administration of  xxxd2150xxx , a nonpeptide
selective at1-receptor antagonist, 50, 100 and 200 mg, and
pd-123319, a selective  xxxg101xxx -receptor antagonist, 5 and
10 mg, did not cause any changes in the basal heart rate
levels. as shown in fig. 1, the i.a. administration of forasar-

as shown in fig. 2, u-73122, a phospholipase c inhibitor, at 0.1, 0.2 and 0.4 mg reduced the postganglionic effect
of ang ii but did not influence that of ach.
as shown in fig. 3, 2-apb, a cell-permeant modulator
of the ins(1,4,5)p3 receptors, at 0.5, 1 and 2 mg inhibited

discussion

ang ii signal transduction in ganglia

present study, exogenous ach injected i.a. was able to
stimulate the cardiac sympathetic ganglion by either nicotinic or muscarinic receptor activation (15, 16). nicotinic
receptors are ligand-gated ion channels, and their activation
always causes a rapid increase in the cellular permeability
to na+ and ca2+, depolarization and excitation (21). in
contrast, muscarinic receptors belong to the class of socalled g-protein-coupled receptors and the responses to
muscarinic agonists are not necessarily linked to changes in
ion permeability (21). in the present investigation, the
ganglionic stimulatory response to ang ii was not inhibited
by the combined treatment with hexamethonium and atropine that strongly diminished both the frequency-dependent
response to preganglionic stimulation and the dose-dependent response to ach in spinal dogs (15, 16). this finding is
fully compatible with the findings of previous reports in
which the positive chronotropic response to ang ii injected
i.a. toward the cardiac sympathetic ganglia in spinal cats
and dogs was unaltered when the ganglionic transmission
was blocked with hexamethonium and atropine (6, 18).
consequently, the ganglionic stimulatory effect of ang ii
does not involve the cholinergic system in the ganglionic
transmission.
in the pithed rat, losartan, an at1-receptor antagonist,
but not pd-123177, an  xxxg101xxx -receptor antagonist, inhibited
the tachycardiac response to ang ii that is due to the stimulation of the cardiac sympathetic ganglia (22), thus suggesting that the ang ii receptor in the sympathetic ganglia
most likely has an at1 subtype (23). this finding is also
consistent with the findings of an in vitro functional study
showing that the ang ii-induced depolarization of the rat
superior cervical ganglion was blocked by losartan, but
not by pd-123177 (24). in the present in vivo experiment,
the ganglionic stimulatory response to ang ii in the dog
cardiac sympathetic ganglia was also inhibited by  xxxd2150xxx , which is described as a non-peptide competitive at1receptor antagonist (25), but not by pd-123319, an at2receptor antagonist. therefore, the ang ii-induced stimulation of the dog sympathetic ganglia is also mediated by
the at1 subtype of the ang ii receptor.
a number of biochemical studies have demonstrated
that ang ii receptors are coupled via a number of different
g-proteins to a variety of signal transduction pathways,
which include the stimulation of phospholipase c and the
mobilization of intracellular calcium (26). in this study,
ach as well as ang ii-induced ganglionic stimulation was
inhibited by  xxxd2684xxx , which causes the uncoupling
of gtp-binding proteins from receptors by the same mechanism as iap, islet-activating protein (27). however, u73122 identified as the inhibitor of phospholipase c in
neuronal cells (28), inhibited the ganglionic stimulatory
response to ang ii, but not to ach. furthermore, the ganglionic stimulatory response to ang ii but not ach was

387

also reduced by the administration with 2-apb, a recently
identified and selective cell-permeant modulator of the
ins(1,4,5)p3 receptors, which inhibits the contraction of
thoracic aorta isolated from rabbits induced by ang ii,
but showed no effect on the contraction of potassiumdepolarized muscle (29). furthermore, ach-induced muscarinic ganglionic stimulation is mediated by m1-ach
receptors coupled to g-protein associated with guanylate
cyclase and  xxxd1274xxx  pathways in the superior cervical
ganglia of rabbits (30). the fact supports the present results
that in contrast with the response to ang ii, ach-induced
ganglionic stimulation was not due to the activation of the
signal transduction of phospholipase c – phosphoinositide
breakdown pathways. accordingly, the ach and ang iiinduced ganglionic stimulation is mediated via the activating receptors coupled with g-protein, and the effect of
ang ii thus involves phospholipase c activation and a
stimulation of phosphoinositide hydrolysis.
in the present in vivo experiment, the treatment of the
cardiac sympathetic ganglia with sq-22536, adenylate
cyclase inhibitor, did not affect the ganglionic stimulation
induced by ang ii. in our previous report (20), the application of dibutyryl  xxxd1773xxx , a membrane permeable
cyclic nucleotides, to the dog cardiac sympathetic ganglia
also did not affect the positive chronotropic response to
ang ii. these findings thus indicate that the activation of
cyclic nucleotides is not involved in the ganglionic response to ang ii. intraarterial administration of nifedipine,
a voltage-dependent ca2+-channel antagonist, also inhibited
the ganglionic stimulatory effect of ang ii, but the inhibitions by the antagonist at a subsequent high dose of 100 mg
were limited to 50% and 41% inhibition from the controls.
it has recently been demonstrated that  xxxd2087xxx , an intracellular calcium-associated protein kinase inhibitor, potently
inhibits protein kinases, such as cyclic nucleotide-dependent protein kinase and ca2+/cam-dependent myosin light
chain kinase (31). furthermore, the antagonistic effects of
 xxxd2087xxx  on protein kinase are also likely related to the
blocking action of intracellular calcium (32). in this study,
the ganglionic stimulatory responses to ang ii were inhibited in a dose-dependent manner by  xxxd2087xxx , whereas
those to ach were unaffected. the above described findings thus imply that the ganglionic stimulatory response to
ang ii involves not only the intracellular stored ca2+ mobilization but also the extracellular ca2+ influx. besides, the
ganglionic stimulation elicited by ang ii but not ach was
blocked by calphostin c, described as a potent and specific
protein kinase c inhibitor (33). the fact is consistent with
the finding that the at1-receptor-mediated reduction of
neuronal delayed rectifier current by ang ii in cultured
neurons which contributes to neuronal membrane depolarization is partially reduced by treatment with calphostin c
(34).

w-7, a cam inactivator (35), inhibited the ganglionic
stimulating response to ang ii in a dose-dependent fashion,
but not that to ach, in this study. the ganglionic stimulatory
effect of ang ii and the enhancement in the effect after
repetitive preganglionic stimulation were also prevented in
a dose-dependent manner by w-7 in our previous study
(20). furthermore, it has been demonstrated that based on
a biochemical study, stimulation of at1 receptors on cultured neurons stimulates pi hydrolysis, increases in intracellular ca2+ and increases activation of cam kinase ii (36).
in the present study, a selective ca2+/cam-dependent protein kinase ii inhibitor, kn-93 (37), also inhibited the
ganglionic effects of ang ii, without affecting those of ach.
in line with current results, the at1-receptor-mediated
reduction of neuronal delayed rectifier current by ang ii
is partially blocked by either the cam antagonist w-7 or
the specific cam kinase ii inhibitor kn-93 (38). the findings indicate that, the ganglionic stimulatory response to
ang ii may involve an intracellular second messenger, the
ca2+/cam-dependent protein kinase ii pathway, although
the activities of ca2+/cam-dependent protein kinase ii in
the cardiac sympathetic ganglia after ang ii still remain to
be determined.
furthermore, ca2+/ cam kinase ii is a known modulator
of ion channels and is activated by ang ii via at1-receptors
in vascular smooth muscle cells (39). it has been demonstrated that ang ii, via  xxxg100xxx , opens a non-selective
na+/ ca2+ channel and elicits neuronal depolarization (40).
based on electrophysiological studies, it has thus been
proposed that the ganglionic stimulating effect of ang ii is
due to an increase of the permeability of the postsynaptic
membrane to na+ (5). ang ii stimulates an amiloride-sensitive na+/h+ exchange system in cultured vascular smooth
muscle cells which is mediated in part by protein kinase cdependent mechanism (41). in the present in vivo study,
the ganglionic stimulant effect of ang ii, but not ach, was
clearly inhibited by dimethylamiloride. according to these
facts, it is presumed that the signal transduction to the
ganglionic stimulatory response to ang ii involeves, in
part, a ca2+/cam kinase ii-operated na+ influx.
based on our findings, we therefore propose that the signal transduction mechanisms of the postganglionic stimulatory response to ang ii probably involve, in part, the activation of at1-receptor coupled to g-protein-associated
phospholipase c with generation of ip3 and subsequent
intracellular ca2+ mobilization and activation of protein
kinase c and ca2+/ cam kinase ii to mediate the rapid actions of ang ii on neuronal membrane amiloride-sensitive
na+ influx.
