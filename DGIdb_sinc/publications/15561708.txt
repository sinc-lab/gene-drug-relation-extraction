 xxxg1562xxx  and  xxxg1562xxx -like enzymes are present in almost all organisms and fulfill their main functions during iron-sulfur ([fe-s])
cluster synthesis. accordingly, they have a cysteine desulfurase activity that is required for the mobilization of sulfur
from l-cysteine by simultaneous release of l-alanine. in all
 xxxg1562xxx -like enzymes, the sulfide is bound as a persulfide to a
conserved cysteine residue of the protein, from which it is
subsequently transferred to other target proteins such as the
scaffold proteins nifu and/or iscu in bacteria to finally assemble [fe-s] clusters. a  xxxd3047xxx  (plp)1 cofactor

bound to a conserved lysine residue is essential for this cysteine
desulfurase activity (1). however, besides [fe-s] cluster formation, other functions for  xxxg1562xxx -like proteins are described as
well. the escherichia coli  xxxg1562xxx  protein also was found to be
involved in the biosynthesis of thiamin and nad⫹ and to be
able to transfer a sulfur atom to uridine to produce a 4-thiouridine trna (2). in e. coli, another  xxxg1562xxx -like protein, sufs
(csdb), is able to catalyze the elimination of selenium from
 xxxd3186xxx  more efficiently than the elimination of sulfur
from l-cysteine (3). however, its physiological function is connected to its cysteine desulfurase activity, which is up to 50⫻
higher when sufs forms a complex with sufe (4). the only
 xxxg1562xxx -like protein in yeast, nfs1p, is essential not only for [fe-s]
cluster formation in mitochondria but also for trna splicing
(5). for cell viability, this protein also needs to be localized in
the cytosol and to some extent in the nucleus (6).
similar to bacteria, arabidopsis thaliana also possesses
more than one  xxxg1562xxx -like protein: atnfs1, which is located in
mitochondria (7), and atnfs2, which is located in chloroplasts
(8, 9). however, cysteine desulfurase activity was also shown
for aba3 (10). aba3 is a molybdenum cofactor (moco) sulfurase consisting of an n-terminal  xxxg1562xxx -like domain that is
fused to a c-terminal domain with an as yet unknown function,
thereby being distinguished from all other  xxxg1562xxx -like proteins
described thus far. although its physiological function is unrelated to [fe-s] cluster assembly, cysteine desulfurase activity
and sulfur transferase activity of aba3 were shown to be
essential for the activation of the two moco-containing enzymes
 xxxg168xxx  (ao;  xxxg168xxx ) and  xxxg2431xxx 
(xdh; ec 1.1.1.204) that are involved in abscisic acid biosynthesis and degradation of purines, respectively (for review, see
refs. 11–13). after having incorporated the moco, ao and xdh
remain inactive unless one of the two oxygen ligands at the
molybdenum center is replaced by a sulfur atom that is delivered by aba3. this sulfuration step catalyzes the final maturation of ao and xdh enzymes that occur in both the sulfoform and the desulfo-form in the living cell. by this mechanism,
the plant is able to rapidly increase the activities of ao and
xdh, e.g. for adapting to altering environmental conditions
without de novo synthesis of ao and xdh apoproteins.
in this work, we examined the mechanism of sulfur mobilization as catalyzed by the  xxxg1562xxx -like domain of aba3 from
a. thaliana. we identified the nature of the cofactor and the
sulfur bound by aba3- xxxg1562xxx  and characterized the sub-activities of the protein. finally, we examined the function of the
highly conserved lysine 271 and cysteine 430, and we discussed
the role of the  xxxg1562xxx -like domain during moco sulfuration.

the  xxxg1441xxx  aba3 from arabidopsis thaliana specifically regulates the activity of
the molybdenum enzymes  xxxg168xxx  and  xxxg2431xxx  by converting their molybdenum
cofactor from the desulfo-form into the sulfo-form. aba3
is a two-domain protein with an nh2-terminal domain
sharing significant similarities to  xxxg1562xxx  proteins that catalyze the decomposition of l-cysteine to l-alanine and
elemental sulfur for iron-sulfur cluster synthesis. although different in its physiological function, the mechanism of aba3 for sulfur mobilization was found to be
similar to  xxxg1562xxx  proteins. the protein binds a pyridoxal
phosphate cofactor and a substrate-derived persulfide
intermediate, and site-directed mutagenesis of strictly
conserved binding sites for the cofactor and the persulfide demonstrated that they are essential for  xxxg1441xxx  activity. in vitro, the  xxxg1562xxx -like
domain of aba3 activates  xxxg168xxx  and  xxxg2431xxx  in the absence of the c-terminal
domain, but in vivo, the c-terminal domain is required
for proper activation of both target enzymes. in addition
to its cysteine desulfurase activity, aba3- xxxg1562xxx  also exhibits  xxxg2016xxx  activity. although  xxxd3186xxx  is unlikely to be a natural substrate for aba3, it
is decomposed more efficiently than l-cysteine. besides
mitochondrial atnfs1 and plastidial atnfs2, which are
both proposed to be involved in iron-sulfur cluster formation, aba3 is proposed to be a third and cytosolic
 xxxg1562xxx -like cysteine desulfurase in a. thaliana. however,
the sulfur transferase activity of aba3 is used for posttranslational activation of molybdenum enzymes rather
than for iron-sulfur cluster assembly.

experimental procedures

substrate during 10 min at 37 °c. inactivation of recombinant ao␣ by
cyanide was performed in 20 mm tris/hcl, ph 8.0, in the presence of 50
mm kcn for 20 h at 37 °c. after this incubation period, the generated
thiocyanate was removed by rebuffering the protein to 20 mm tris/hcl,
ph 8.0, before subsequent reconstitution assays. in vitro reconstitution
of recombinant ao␣ by aba3 was performed aerobically in a total
volume of 150 ␮l of 20 mm tris/hcl, ph 8.0. three ␮g of ao␣ were
incubated with the respective aba3 protein (10 mol aba3 protein/mol
ao␣) in the presence of 0.5 mm l-cysteine for 1 h at 37 °c, followed by
native page with 0.33 volume of the reaction mixture and activity
staining with indole-3-carboxaldehyde as substrate as described in
ref. 14.
determination of protein concentrations—concentrations of total
soluble protein were determined by use of roti quant solution (roth,
karlsruhe, germany) as described in ref. 17.
wavescan of aba3 proteins—absorption spectroscopy was carried out
using an ultrospec 3000® spectrophotometer (amersham biosciences).
identification of  xxxd3047xxx  as the aba3-bound chromophore—plp was identified by the specific fluorescence of a plpcyanide product that is formed during coincubation of free plp and
cyanide (18). plp therefore has to be released from the protein by
combined treatment with trichloroacetic acid and heating, by which the
protein is denatured. subsequent addition of potassium cyanide and
adjustment of ph to 3.8 allows the detection of the formed plp-cyanide
product by following the fluorescence at 420 nm after excitation at 325
nm. comparison of plp-cyanide-specific fluorescence with a plp standard curve allows the determination of absolute plp amounts within a
given protein sample of known concentration. as known from other
 xxxg1562xxx -like enzymes and indicated by the presence of one putative plpbinding site within the primary sequence of aba3, binding of one plp
molecule per aba3 protein monomer was assumed. the concentration
of the protein in each sample therefore was adjusted to ⱕ1 nmol to fit
into the standard curve range (0 –1 nmol). because the molecular mass
of the  xxxg1562xxx -like domain of aba3 is 55 kda, a maximum amount of 55 ␮g
of purified aba3- xxxg1562xxx  (1 ␮g ⫽ 0.01818 nmol) per sample can be used.
finally, fluorescence of the protein samples was measured, and excitation and emission spectra were detected and compared with those of
pure plp.
identification of the aba3-bound persulfide intermediate—to prove
the nature of the transferable sulfur bound by aba3- xxxg1562xxx , we followed
a procedure described previously (19). initially, 250 ␮g of aba3- xxxg1562xxx 
were coincubated with 1 mm l-cysteine for 30 min in a total volume of
500 ␮l to yield maximum saturation of the protein with transferable
sulfur. excess substrate in the sample was removed by buffer exchange
using a microcon concentrator with a 30-kda molecular weight cutoff
(millipore). aba3- xxxg1562xxx  then was coincubated with 0.2 mm 1,5-i-aedans for 1 min at 25 °c. the excess of unbound 1,5-i-aedans was
removed by buffer exchange as described above to avoid nonspecific
fluorescence. subsequently, addition of 1 mm dtt released only those
1,5-i-aedans molecules from the protein that were bound via a disulfide bond that originated from an enzyme-bound cysteinyl persulfide.
after separating low mass molecules from the protein sample, the low
mass molecule fraction was analyzed for 1,5-i-aedans-specific fluorescence under uv light. a protein sample that was incubated in the
absence of l-cysteine but treated in the same way at all other steps
served as a control.
results

identification of the aba3-bound chromophore as plp—
a specific motif with an invariant lysine residue, conserved
among  xxxg1562xxx -like proteins (1), argued for plp as a chromophoric
cofactor bound to aba3- xxxg1562xxx . spectra of protein samples that
were treated as described under “experimental procedures”
were compared with those of pure plp and found to be very
similar, thus indicating that the bound chromophore is in fact
plp (fig. 1). furthermore, comparison of the protein-derived
fluorescence with a plp standard curve showed that the calculated number of plp molecules bound by one monomer of
aba3- xxxg1562xxx  is 0.91 in protein samples that were obtained when
culturing e. coli in the presence of 5 mm pyridoxine (table i).
lowering the pyridoxine concentrations in the e. coli growth
medium also lowered the values for the plp/monomer ratio,
indicating that supplementation with pyridoxine is required
when hyperproducing plp-binding aba3- xxxg1562xxx  in e. coli and
that each monomer of aba3- xxxg1562xxx  binds one plp molecule.

construction of expression vectors—during purification of the nterminally his6-tagged protein, it became obvious that aba3 is not only
present in full-length with a molecular mass of about 90 kda but also as
a c-terminally truncated cleavage product. the molecular mass of this
product was found to correspond well with the calculated mass of the
aba3  xxxg1562xxx -like domain as deduced from sequence comparison with
other  xxxg1562xxx -like proteins. both full-length aba3 and the cleavage product were detected by anti-his tag antibodies in immunoblot analysis.
therefore, the cleavage product as purified by affinity chromatography
most likely represents the n-terminal  xxxg1562xxx -like domain of aba3.
hence, we cloned the 5⬘-region of 1518 bp of the aba3 cdna open
reading frame (genbank af325457) encoding a peptide of 506 amino
acids with a molecular mass of ⬃56 kda and introduced a tga termination codon at the 3⬘-end. the aba3 cdna construct described previously (10) was used for expression of the full-length protein and as a
template for pcr generation of constructs expressing either the nifslike domain or the c-terminal domain of aba3, respectively. primers
for generating aba3- xxxg1562xxx  cdna fragments were as follows:  xxxg1562xxx -startbamhi/ncoi, 5-ttt-ctt-gga-tcc-atg-gaa-gca-ttt-ctt-aaggaa-ttc-3⬘; and  xxxg1562xxx -stop-bamhi, 5⬘-ata-tat-gga-ttc-tca-ggttcc-att-ccc-agt-ctt-ctt-3⬘. primers for generating a 921-bp
open reading frame of the c-terminal domain were as follows: c-termstart-bamhi, 5⬘-tat-ata-gga-ttc-atg-caa-ctt-ctt-agt-gaagac-ctt-gaa-3⬘; and c-term-stop-bamhi, 5⬘-cac-aag-cgg-atcctt-att-caa-tat-ctg-gat-taa-ctt-ctt-ccc-c-3⬘. the resulting pcr fragments were digested with bamhi and subcloned into
bamhi-pretreated pqe80 (qiagen, hilden, germany), thereby fusing
the respective protein’s n terminus to a his6 tag.
expression of aba3, aba3- xxxg1562xxx , and aba3-c—protein expressions
of aba3, aba3- xxxg1562xxx , and aba3-c were performed in freshly transformed e. coli dl41 cells. expression conditions for full-length aba3
were as described previously (10). for expression of aba3- xxxg1562xxx , cells
were grown at 37 °c to an a600 ⫽ 0.5 before a combined induction with
0.2 mm isopropyl ␤-d-thiogalactopyranoside and 5 g lactose/liter expression culture. after induction, cells were cultured for an additional 22 h
at 22 °c. hyperproduction of the c-terminal domain of aba3 was
performed by growing cells at 37 °c to an a600 ⫽ 0.5 before induction
with 0.2 mm isopropyl ␤-d-thiogalactopyranoside and additional culturing for 20 h at 30 °c. cells were harvested by centrifugation and stored
at ⫺70 °c until use.
expression of ao␣ in yeast—overexpression of recombinant his6tagged arabidopsis ao␣ in the yeast pichia pastoris (kindly provided by
tomokazu koshiba, tokyo, japan) was performed as described previously (14).
purification of his6-tagged proteins—purification of recombinant
aba3, its separately expressed domains, and ao␣ was performed on a
nickel- xxxd2739xxx  superflow matrix (qiagen) under native conditions at 4 °c according to the manufacturer’s instructions. proteins
were rebuffered to 20 mm tris/hcl, ph 8.0, containing 2 mm dithiothreitol (dtt) and stored at 4 °c, except for the c-terminal domain of aba3
that was found to be unstable in low-salt buffers. for further purification, aba3 proteins were subjected to anion exchange chromatography
using a 10-ml source q-15 column (amersham biosciences) equilibrated with 20 mm tris/hcl, ph 8.0, 2 mm dtt, and 0.5 mm edta
(buffer a). protein samples were applied to the column and eluted with
buffer a followed by a linear gradient of 0 –1 m nacl in buffer a. final
purification and size determination were achieved by chromatography
on a preparative 100-ml superose 12 size exclusion column (amersham
biosciences) equilibrated with 20 mm tris/hcl, ph 8.0, containing 300
mm nacl and 2 mm dtt.
enzyme assays—l-cysteine desulfurase activity of recombinant
aba3 proteins was recorded either as the amount of l-alanine or as the
amount of hydrogen sulfide released from l-cysteine as described previously (refs. 1 and 15, respectively). l- xxxg2016xxx  activity
was measured by determination of h2se with lead acetate as described
previously (16), except that assays were performed at 37 °c in 50 mm
tris/hcl, ph 9.3, containing 2 mm dtt. the substrate  xxxd3186xxx 
always was freshly prepared from its oxidized form, l-selenocystine,
under anaerobic conditions in the presence of 5 mol dtt/mol l-selenocystine as described in ref. 16. km for l-cysteine was determined over a
substrate range of 0.01–1 mm within 10 min at 37 °c with 20 ␮g of
aba3- xxxg1562xxx  in 20 mm tris/hcl, ph 9.3, by measuring the production of
h2s. km for  xxxd3186xxx  was determined over a substrate range
of 0.005–1 mm within 5 min at 37 °c with 25 ␮g of aba3- xxxg1562xxx  in 50 mm
tris/hcl, ph 9.3, by measuring the production of h2se. specific activities were determined with 20 ␮g of aba3- xxxg1562xxx  using 0.5 mm of each

identification of the aba3-bound sulfur as persulfide—for
specific proof of a bound persulfide intermediate, we used the
fluorescent alkylating reagent 1,5-i-aedans, which binds to
exposed thiol groups of protein cysteinyl residues, thereby
forming either thio-esters at free sh groups or disulfide bonds
in the case of prebound persulfides. once having bound to free
sh groups, 1,5-i-aedans cannot be released from the protein
by reducing agents such as dtt, whereas 1,5-i-aedans
linked to the protein by disulfide bonds can be cleaved off
efficiently in the presence of dtt by reducing both thiol groups
of the disulfide bond. 1,5-i-aedans released from the protein
by dtt treatment can be identified by its specific fluorescence.
our results show that a significantly higher fluorescence was
detected in samples that contained aba3- xxxg1562xxx  pre-incubated
with l-cysteine in comparison with samples that were not preincubated with l-cysteine (table ii). thus, it can be concluded

that during the incubation of aba3- xxxg1562xxx  with l-cysteine, a
persulfide intermediate was formed that was later released by
dtt treatment. furthermore, significantly less 1,5-i-aedans-specific fluorescence was detected when using an altered protein carrying an alanine instead of a cysteine residue
at position 430 (aba3- xxxg1562xxx /c430a), indicating that the motif
responsible for binding the persulfide intermediate contains
cysteine 430 as an essential core residue.
cysteine desulfurase activity of aba3- xxxg1562xxx —to determine
whether cysteine desulfurase activity of aba3 is located within
the  xxxg1562xxx -like domain, we used aba3- xxxg1562xxx  to convert l-cysteine
into l-alanine and elemental sulfur according to ref. 1 and as
described previously for full-length aba3 (10). aba3- xxxg1562xxx  converted l-cysteine even more efficiently within a given time than
equimolar amounts of full-length aba3 (fig. 2a). addition of
the c-terminal domain to the  xxxg1562xxx -like domain reduced rather
than enhanced cysteine desulfurase activity. these results
were also reflected by the in gel ao activity assay, in which the
sulfur as mobilized from l-cysteine and bound to aba3 or
aba3- xxxg1562xxx , respectively, is transferred to the moco of recombinant ao␣. the  xxxg1562xxx -like domain of aba3 alone was found to
have the ability to donate sulfur for activation of ao␣ (fig. 2b).
furthermore, as seen for cysteine desulfurization, aba3- xxxg1562xxx 
was more efficient than full-length aba3 in activation of ao␣,
whereas the presence of the c-terminal domain again had no
enhancing effect.
additionally, we quantified the amount of sulfide that was
released as hydrogen sulfide in the presence of the reductant
dtt to analyze the conversion of sulfur substrates other than
l-cysteine that might not release l-alanine. of all putative
sulfur substrates tested, only l-cysteine and l-cysteine methylester were converted by aba3- xxxg1562xxx . however, the amount of
h2s detected when using l-cysteine methylester as substrate
was only 37.9% relative to l-cysteine. no release of h2s was
detected from the other tested substrates (l-cysteine ethylester, glutathione, ␤-mercaptopyruvate, l- xxxd1787xxx , and
l-cystine).
identification of residues essential for catalysis—substitution of the invariant aba3- xxxg1562xxx  lysine 271, which corresponds
to azotobacter vinelandii lysine 202 and is believed to participate in plp binding (1), with a serine (aba3- xxxg1562xxx /k271s)
resulted in complete loss of the yellow color that is typical for
purified plp-containing aba3- xxxg1562xxx  protein. this change in
color is accompanied by a change of the visible spectrum of the
altered protein. whereas the spectrum of aba3- xxxg1562xxx  showed a
maximum at ⬃420 nm, no maximum but just a shoulder could
be observed in the aba3- xxxg1562xxx /k271s spectrum (fig. 3a). on
the activity level, this mutation caused a complete loss of cysteine desulfurase activity and  xxxg1441xxx  activity (fig. 3, b
and c).
substituting the cysteinyl residue, which corresponds to
a. vinelandii cysteine 325 and is proposed to bind the persulfide (19), with an alanine (aba3- xxxg1562xxx /c430a) did not affect the
spectroscopic properties of aba3 (data not shown) but strongly

reduced the two sub-activities of the protein. a residual cysteine desulfurase activity of ⬃14% was found when comparing
aba3- xxxg1562xxx /c430a with aba3- xxxg1562xxx  (fig. 3b). this decreased
ability to mobilize sulfur from l-cysteine is reflected by the
reduced ability of aba3- xxxg1562xxx /c430a to activate recombinant
ao␣ (fig. 3c).
 xxxg2016xxx  activity of aba3- xxxg1562xxx —most  xxxg1562xxx -like
proteins catalyze not only the formation of elemental sulfur
and alanine from l-cysteine but also the formation of elemental
selenium and alanine from  xxxd3186xxx . it was found that
aba3- xxxg1562xxx  decomposed the selenium substrate even more efficiently than the sulfur substrate l-cysteine. using 0.5 mm
l-cysteine as substrate, the specific activity of the purified
enzyme was determined to be 3.7 mol product/min/mol protein,
as measured by the production of h2s (table iii). in contrast,
the specific activity with  xxxd3186xxx  as substrate was 21.4
mol product/min/mol protein, as measured by the formation of
l-alanine. whereas the apparent km of aba3- xxxg1562xxx  for l-cysteine is 50 ␮m, the km for  xxxd3186xxx  is 200 ␮m, indicating
that aba3- xxxg1562xxx  prefers l-cysteine over  xxxd3186xxx . however, it should be noted that deviation from standard michaelis-menten kinetics was observed at concentrations above 1.0
mm for either substrate, thereby precluding the determination
of true km values for aba3- xxxg1562xxx . furthermore, because activity of aba3- xxxg1562xxx  is very sensitive to ph and temperature, the
km value might also depend on the conditions used.

plp cofactor and therefore lost its cysteine desulfurase activity, was found to be blocked in  xxxg2016xxx  activity as
well (fig. 4). furthermore, like the capacity to desulfurate
l-cysteine, the ability to deselenate  xxxd3186xxx  also was

is reduced in the presence of the c-terminal domain, an interaction of aba3- xxxg1562xxx  and the c-terminal domain during catalysis is not unlikely, although such an has not been able to be
shown to date.2 both full-length aba3 and aba3- xxxg1562xxx  form
homodimers with an apparent molecular mass of 200 ⫾ 10 and
105 kda, respectively, whereas the c-terminal domain is monomeric with a mass of 31 kda.3 this implies that dimerization
of full-length aba3 is mediated by its  xxxg1562xxx -like domain and
that one aba3 dimer mobilizes two sulfur atoms as required by
ao and xdh, which are dimers of two independently acting
subunits as well. thus, it might well be that the c-terminal
domain coordinates the sulfur transfer from one subunit of
aba3- xxxg1562xxx  to one subunit of ao or xdh, thereby also affecting
the efficiency of aba3- xxxg1562xxx  during sulfur mobilization.
like most of the  xxxg1562xxx -like proteins, aba3- xxxg1562xxx  also was
found to act on l-cysteine and  xxxd3186xxx . decomposition
of  xxxd3186xxx  by aba3- xxxg1562xxx  was found to be more efficient
than cysteine desulfurization, which is true for other  xxxg1562xxx -like
enzymes as well (24). however, no specific physiological function is obvious for the  xxxg2016xxx  activity of aba3
because no selenium-containing enzymes were described for
higher plants to this end. it is still questionable whether higher
plants even possess the protein environment for the formation
of  xxxd3186xxx  and thus whether a mechanism for the
decomposition of selenocysteine is required at all.
when comparing aba3- xxxg1562xxx  with other  xxxg1562xxx -like enzymes
that were described to function in [fe-s] cluster formation, it
became obvious that aba3- xxxg1562xxx  comprises all properties and
features that are typical for “classical”  xxxg1562xxx -enzymes: (i) aba3nifs is a homodimer and mediates dimerization of the fulllength aba3 protein. (ii) it binds a plp cofactor that is essential for cysteine desulfurase activity and consequently for
sulfur transferase activity, as was shown by proving binding of
one mole plp per mole of aba3- xxxg1562xxx  and by characterization
of the aba3- xxxg1562xxx /k271s protein. (iii) it catalyzes the formation
of l-alanine and elemental sulfur by using l-cysteine as substrate to generate an enzyme-bound cysteinyl persulfide, which
was shown by treatment of the aba3- xxxg1562xxx  protein with the
 xxxd3249xxx  1,5-i-aedans and by site-directed mutagenesis of the proposed persulfide binding site at cysteine 430. (iv)
aba3- xxxg1562xxx  possesses sulfur transferase activity, which is required for transferring the persulfide sulfur to the moco of ao
and xdh, and (v) it harbors  xxxg2016xxx  activity,
which also depends on the presence of plp and is profoundly
dependent on cysteine 430. although the physiological function
of aba3 is very distinct from the function of all  xxxg1562xxx  proteins
described thus far, our findings indicate that aba3 can be
referred to as a  xxxg1562xxx -like protein. hence, it can be concluded
that besides atnfs1 in mitochondria and atnfs2 in chloroplasts, aba3 represents a third and putative cytosolic nifslike protein in a. thaliana.

discussion

moco sulfurases catalyze the transfer of a sulfur atom to the
mo center of enzymes belonging to the  xxxg2431xxx  class
such as ao and xdh, thereby activating these enzymes. before
moco sulfuration, the molybdenum of the cofactor is coordinating two oxygen ligands, one of which has to be replaced by this
sulfur atom. previous experiments have shown that the moco
sulfurase aba3 from a. thaliana is able to activate ao␣ from
a. thaliana in vitro in the presence of l-cysteine as sulfur
substrate (10). the n-terminal domain of aba3 reveals remarkable similarities to bacterial  xxxg1562xxx  and  xxxg1562xxx -like enzymes,
suggesting a common mechanism for sulfur mobilization and
transfer. in this work, it was shown that the  xxxg1562xxx  domain of
aba3 binds a plp cofactor and generates a protein-bound
persulfide intermediate from the decomposition of l-cysteine,
as was demonstrated previously for  xxxg1562xxx  from a. vinelandii (1,
19). however, unlike other  xxxg1562xxx -like proteins, aba3 does not
utilize the sulfur for [fe-s] cluster assembly but transfers it to
the moco of ao and xdh for generation of the sulfurated form
of moco, which is the essential final step for activation of ao
and xdh. in vitro, the  xxxg1562xxx  domain of aba3 alone possesses
not only cysteine desulfurase activity but also the capacity to
activate ao␣. because this activation of ao␣ can be ascribed to
the formation of sulfide, it can be assumed that any protein
that releases sulfide in principal is able to sulfurate the moco of
ao␣. however, in planta, all known mutations within the
 xxxg1562xxx -like domain of aba3 lead to a complete loss of ao and
xdh activity (10, 20, 21), thereby demonstrating the specificity
of aba3. it is most likely that in vivo the specificity for aba3
is bound to its subcellular localization, which is different from
the localization of the other a. thaliana cysteine desulfurases.
unlike atnfs1 and atnfs2, which are located in mitochondria and chloroplast, respectively, aba3 presumably is a cytosolic protein, like its target enzyme ao (22). it might well be
that, in addition to the respective localization, the sulfur transfer from the  xxxg1562xxx  domain to the moco of ao and xdh also
needs the presence of the c-terminal domain. in vivo, the
function of the c-terminal domain is required for activation of
ao and xdh, as was shown recently by characterization of the
tomato flacca mutant (23). although this  xxxg1441xxx  mutant has detectable activities of ao and xdh in the roots, it
shows a complete loss of ao and xdh activities in the shoot,
indicating that the function of the c-terminal domain is a
regulative one. because cysteine desulfurization by aba3- xxxg1562xxx
