adverse effects of  xxxd201xxx  used in the

 xxxd201xxx , a selective ␣2-agonist, was developed to lower intraocular pressure and minimize the systemic side effects associated with the use of its parent drug, clonidine.1 an investigation of
the site of action of  xxxd201xxx  incidentally uncovered a reversal
of anisocoria in patients with absent sympathetic innervation of one
pupil (horner syndrome) due to its ␣1-effect on a pupil with denervation supersensitivity.2 it has been used as a diagnostic test for
horner syndrome.3,4 we report adverse effects of topical  xxxd201xxx  when used in the diagnosis of horner syndrome in infants.

case reports

a

5-month-old infant girl was noted to have anisocoria from the age of 4 weeks. on examination in the
dark, her pupils measured 5 mm in the right and 3
mm in the left eye. in light, the pupils were equal at 3 mm
in both eyes. one drop of 1%  xxxd201xxx  hydrochloride
(alcon laboratories uk, ltd.) was instilled in each eye.
on review 1 hour later, there was no reversal of the
anisocoria; however, there was blanching of the periocular
skin, and the parents reported that the infant was excessively drowsy. two hours after instillation of the drops,
the infant was taken to the emergency department, where
she was found to be lethargic and difﬁcult to rouse, with
bradycardia (84/min), shallow respiration (40/min), and a
blood pressure of 115/85. her oxygen saturation was 80%
but improved rapidly to 100% with oxygen given via a face
mask. eight hours after instillation of drops, her condition
stabilized and her vital signs returned to normal.
following the experience with the above case, 600
members of the pediatric ophthalmology internet discussion group were asked for their experience in the form of
a questionnaire on side effects associated with the use of

 xxxd201xxx  in the diagnosis of horner syndrome in
infants.
nine replies were received. in three cases, there were
no recognized side effects associated with the use of
 xxxd201xxx  for the diagnosis of horner syndrome.
two cases were reports of adverse events with brimonidine, a related ␣2-agonist, when used in the treatment of glaucoma.
four infants were noted to have extreme drowsiness
after the instillation of  xxxd201xxx  for the diagnosis of
horner syndrome. in three cases the patients were less
than 6 months old, drowsiness was the only reported side
effect, vital signs were not monitored, and no further
details could be recalled. the fourth case was a 10-weekold infant girl who was given one drop of  xxxd201xxx 
0.5% in each eye. one hour later, she became drowsy,
unresponsive, and difﬁcult to rouse. her respiratory rate
was 48 per minute; her heart rate was 158 per minute, and
oxygen saturation was 100%. the unresponsiveness lasted
for 10 hours.
in the two cases where details were recorded there was
no reversal of anisocoria, and urinary tests for catecholamines were negative.

discussion
the index case and four additional cases of adverse reactions to  xxxd201xxx  used for the diagnosis of horner
syndrome in infants were identiﬁed through an internet
inquiry. in three cases drowsiness was reported; two cases
required emergency admission for unresponsiveness. one
case was associated with bradycardia, hypertension, and
decreased oxygen saturations.
excessive sleepiness and lethargy has recently been reported in 76% of children treated with brimonidine, a
similar drug.5 in that report, a number of children were
being treated with  xxxd201xxx  in addition to brimonidine; hence, it is not clear what proportion of these
adverse effects could be attributed to  xxxd201xxx . no
adverse events have been reported with a single drop of
 xxxd201xxx  when used in the diagnosis of horner
syndrome.
cocaine eyedrops have been conventionally used to establish a diagnosis of horner syndrome, with hydroxyamphetamine being used to differentiate between a pre- and
postganglionic lesion.6,7 cocaine is a controlled drug that
is often difﬁcult to acquire at short notice in busy practices.
the easy availability of  xxxd201xxx , its mild ␣1-agonist
activity, and its hitherto benign safety proﬁle has encour-

aged its use as a ﬁrst-line drug in the diagnosis of oculosympathetic paralysis.
the reported adverse effects included in this report
suggest that  xxxd201xxx  should be used with caution or
not at all, in infants under the age of 6 months. though a
reduced concentration of  xxxd201xxx  (0.5%) is also effective in the diagnosis of horner syndrome,8 it is the
immaturity of the blood-brain barrier in young infants that
permits central nervous system depression suggesting that
patients may still be at risk.9 if  xxxd201xxx  must be used
in infants younger than 6 months of age, the patient should
be observed for a period of at least 2 hours after instillation
of the drops, with admission to a pediatric ward prompted
by lethargy, bradycardia, or a reduced respiratory rate.

an eye on the arts – the arts on the eye

in his laboratory at st. mary’s hospital, dr. willcox mixed a bit of his alkaloid extract
into a solution and, with the help of an assistant, placed a couple of droplets into the cat’s
eye. moments later the cat’s pupil expanded to many times its ordinary size. this was an
important clue, for it meant the substance he isolated was “mydriatic”, that is, it had the
power to dilate pupils.
he knew of only four alkaloidal poisons with that power: cocaine, atropine, and two
derivatives of henbane,  xxxd2306xxx  and hyocine. he shined the bright light directly into
the cat’s eyes and found that the pupil held its new diameter. this allowed him to rule out
cocaine, because its mydriatic powers were less pronounced. when exposed to a powerful
light, a pupil dilated with cocaine will still contract.
