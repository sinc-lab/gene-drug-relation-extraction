four  xxxg1250xxx  subunits of the inwardly rectifying k1-channel
family (8, 9).  xxxg19xxx  is thought to mediate the stimulatory effect
of mgadp and is the primary target for pharmacological
agents, such as the sulfonylurea  xxxd2215xxx  and the k1channel opener  xxxd1868xxx . the primary site of atp inhibition
of katp-channel activity seems to be in  xxxg1250xxx  (10, 11).
however, the regulation of the b cell katp channels by adenine
nucleotides and pharmacological agents is complex. in addition to the inhibitory effect, mgatp enhances b cell katpchannel activity (12, 13). adp also has both stimulatory and
inhibitory effects (14, 15). although the interaction of sulfonylureas with  xxxg19xxx  abolishes the stimulatory effect of
mgadp on katp channels (10), the sensitivity of the katp
channel to sulfonylureas is increased in the presence of
mgadp (16–18).
previously, we found that  xxxg19xxx  strongly binds 8-azido-atp
at nbf1, whereas mgadp is bound at nbf2, and that
preincubation of  xxxg19xxx  with mgadp efficiently inhibits
8-azido-atp binding to  xxxg19xxx  (ref. 19; fig. 1a, preincubation
procedure). because this inhibitory effect of mgadp was
reduced by mutations in nbf2, we thought the mgadp bound
at nbf2 might facilitate mgadp binding at nbf1 and thereby
prevent 8-azido-atp binding to nbf1. the strong 8-azidoatp binding to  xxxg19xxx  made it possible to investigate the
biochemical basis of such cooperative interaction. here, we
provide direct biochemical evidence, obtained by postincubation procedure, of the cooperative interaction in nucleotide
binding of the two nbfs of  xxxg19xxx . in addition, we show that
the sulfonylurea  xxxd2215xxx  modulates this cooperative
interaction in nucleotide binding of the two nbfs of  xxxg19xxx .

abstract
the atp-sensitive potassium (katp) channels in pancreatic b cells are critical in the regulation of
glucose-induced insulin secretion. although electrophysiological studies provide clues to the complex control of katp
channels by atp, mgadp, and pharmacological agents, the
molecular mechanism of katp-channel regulation remains
unclear. the  xxxg1253xxx  is a heterooligomeric complex of
 xxxg19xxx  subunits of the atp-binding-cassette superfamily with
two nucleotide-binding folds (nbf1 and nbf2) and the
pore-forming  xxxg1250xxx  subunits. here, we report that mgatp
and mgadp, but not the mg salt of g-thio-atp, stabilize the
binding of prebound 8-azido-[a-32p]atp to  xxxg19xxx . mutation
in the walker a and b motifs of nbf2 of  xxxg19xxx  abolished this
stabilizing effect of mgadp. these results suggest that  xxxg19xxx 
binds 8-azido-atp strongly at nbf1 and that mgadp, either
by direct binding to nbf2 or by hydrolysis of bound mgatp
at nbf2, stabilizes prebound 8-azido-atp binding at nbf1.
the sulfonylurea  xxxd2215xxx  caused release of prebound
8-azido-[a-32p]atp from  xxxg19xxx  in the presence of mgadp or
mgatp in a concentration-dependent manner. this direct
biochemical evidence of cooperative interaction in nucleotide
binding of the two nbfs of  xxxg19xxx  suggests that  xxxd2215xxx 
both blocks this cooperative binding of atp and mgadp and,
in cooperation with the mgadp bound at nbf2, causes atp
to be released from nbf1.
atp-sensitive potassium (katp) channels play many important roles in various tissues by linking the cell metabolic state
to the membrane potential (1, 2). the katp channels in
pancreatic b cells are critical in the regulation of glucoseinduced insulin secretion (3–6). electrophysiological studies of
the complex control of katp channels by atp and mgadp
provide the current model of glucose-induced insulin secretion
in which the subsequent metabolism of glucose transported
through glucose transporters increases atp and decreases
mgadp in the pancreatic b cells. the increase in the
atp:adp ratio closes the katp channels, thereby depolarizing the b cell membrane, and leads to the opening of voltagedependent ca21 channels, allowing ca21 influx into the b cells.
the resultant rise in the intracellular concentration of ca21
triggers insulin release. the pancreatic b cell katp channels
are also the site of action of important therapeutic pharmacological agents such as sulfonylureas and k1-channel openers. sulfonylureas, commonly used in the treatment of
non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, stimulate insulin
secretion by closing the katp channels, whereas k1-channel
openers inhibit insulin secretion by opening the k atp
channels (7).
the pancreatic b cell  xxxg1253xxx  is a complex of four
 xxxg19xxx  subunits of the atp-binding cassette (abc) superfamily with two nucleotide-binding folds (nbf1 and nbf2) and

fig. 1. schematic diagrams of the reaction of  xxxg19xxx  with nucleotides. (a) preincubation procedure (19). membrane proteins from
cos-7 cells expressing hamster  xxxg19xxx  were first incubated with
10–500 mm adp in 5 ml of buffer containing 40 mm triszhcl (ph 7.5),
3 mm  xxxd2534xxx , and 0.1 mm egta (1mg te) or in 5 ml of the same
buffer without  xxxd2534xxx  (2mg te) for 30 min at 0°c. next, 8-azido[a-32p] atp was added to the mixture to a final concentration of 5 mm,
and the mixture was incubated for 10 min at 37°c. the reactions were
stopped by the addition of 500 ml of ice-cold 1mg or 2mg te, and
free 8-azido-[32p]atp was removed after centrifugation (15,000 3 g
for 5 min at 2°c). pellets were washed in the same buffer and
resuspended in 10 ml of ice-cold 1mg te. the mixture was irradiated
for 5 min (at 254 nm, 5.5 mwycm2) on ice. (b) postincubation
procedure. membrane proteins from cos-7 cells expressing  xxxg19xxx 
were incubated with 10 mm 8-azido-[a-32p]atp or 8-azido-[g32p]atp in 2.5 ml of 1mg te containing 2 mm ouabain for 3 min at
37°c. the reactions were stopped, and free 8-azido-[32p]atp was
removed as above. pellets were resuspended in 5 ml of 1mg or 2mg
te containing 2 mm ouabain. membrane proteins were then mixed
with 5 ml of 1mg or 2mg te containing 2 mm adp or atp. the
mixture was incubated for 15 min at 0°c or 37°c and irradiated on ice.
samples were electrophoresed on an sdsy7% polyacrylamide gel and
autoradiographed. the trapped 8-azido-[32p]atp in  xxxg19xxx  was measured by scanning with a radioimaging analyzer (bas2000, fuji).
experiments were done at least in triplicate.

preincubation with 8-azido-[a-32p]atp, 8-azido-[a-32p]atp
dissociated from  xxxg19xxx  in 15 min. about 80% of prebound
8-azido-[a-32p]atp dissociated from  xxxg19xxx  in 5 min in the
absence of mg at 37°c (data not shown), showing that 8-azido[a-32p]atp readily dissociates from  xxxg19xxx  in the absence of
mg21 at 37°c. accordingly, mgadp, by binding to one nbf,
stabilizes prebound 8-azido-[a-32p]atp binding to the other
nbf of  xxxg19xxx . mgatp stabilizes prebound 8-azido-[a32p]atp binding to  xxxg19xxx  with slightly less efficiency, compared with mgadp. in contrast, an atp analogue that
hydrolyzes slowly, atpgs, had no greater stabilizing effect
than mg21 alone. the effects of mgadp and mgatp on the
stabilization of prebound 8-azido-[a-32p]atp binding to
 xxxg19xxx  were concentration-dependent (maximal effects at 0.5
mm for both; fig. 3), suggesting that mgadp, either by direct
binding or by hydrolysis of bound mgatp, stabilizes 8-azidoatp binding. when  xxxg19xxx  was incubated with mgadp or
mgatp after preincubation with 8-azido-[g-32p]atp,  xxxg19xxx 
was photoaffinity-labeled as efficiently as it was with 8-azido[a-32p]atp (fig. 4), indicating that prebound 8-azido-[g32p]atp is not hydrolyzed during incubation with mgadp or
mgatp.
effects of mutations in nbf2 on photoaffinity labeling.
katp-channel activation requires both nbfs of  xxxg19xxx  to be
functional (20, 21). to clarify the role of nbf2 in the stabilization of nucleotide binding, the effects of mutations in nbf2
on photoaffinity labeling were examined by a postincubation
procedure. mutations in the walker a and b motifs, k1385m
and d1506n, abolished the stabilizing effects of mgadp on
8-azido-atp binding, although they had almost no effect on
8-azido-atp (10 mm) binding overall (fig. 5). mutations at
the corresponding sites in other abc proteins reduce mgatp

concentrations ('1 mm), and abolish atp hydrolysis (22, 23).
these results suggest that  xxxg19xxx  binds 8-azido-atp strongly at
nbf1 and that mgadp, by binding at nbf2, stabilizes
prebound 8-azido-atp binding at nbf1. because mgadp
had maximal effect on wild-type  xxxg19xxx , it is unlikely that atp
hydrolysis is required to stabilize 8-azido-atp binding.
mgadp binding to nbf2 more likely induces a conforma-

in nbf2 could well impede these changes.
effects of  xxxd2215xxx  on photoaffinity labeling. although  xxxd2215xxx  in the presence of mg21 alone did not
reduce photoaffinity labeling,  xxxd2215xxx  reduced it in the
presence of mgadp or mgatp in a concentration-dependent
manner (fig. 6). because  xxxd2215xxx  does not affect
8-azido-[a-32p]atp binding to nbf1 directly in the preincubation procedure (data not shown), it could block interaction
between atp binding at nbf1 and mgadp binding at nbf2
and thereby dissociate 8-azido-atp from nbf1. interestingly,
1 mm  xxxd2215xxx  dissociated 8-azido-atp from nbf1
more efficiently in the presence of mgatp or mgadp than in
the presence of mg21 alone. accordingly,  xxxd2215xxx  may
not only block the transduction that stabilizes atp binding at
nbf1 but also, in cooperation with mgadp at nbf2, may
cause the release of atp from nbf1.

discussion
we previously reported that  xxxg19xxx  strongly binds 8-azido-atp
at nbf1, whereas mgadp is bound at nbf2, and that
preincubation of  xxxg19xxx  with mgadp efficiently inhibits
8-azido-atp binding to  xxxg19xxx  (19). in the present study, we
determine that mgadp, by binding at nbf2, stabilizes prebound 8-azido-atp at nbf1. these findings suggest both that
 xxxg19xxx  strongly and stably binds atp at nbf1 and that there
is positive interaction between the two nbfs of  xxxg19xxx . in our
previous study,  xxxg19xxx  was preincubated with mgadp (fig.
1 a); in this study, the mgadp bound at nbf2 may have
facilitated mgadp binding at nbf1 and thereby inhibited
8-azido-[32p]atp binding to nbf1. in the present study,
 xxxg19xxx  was first incubated with 8-azido-[32p]atp (fig. 1b).
 xxxg19xxx  was then postincubated with mgadp, after the removal
of free 8-azido-[32p]atp. by this procedure,  xxxg19xxx  was photoaffinity-labeled with only the 8-azido-[32p]atp prebound at
nbf1 and continuously bound during postincubation; otherwise, the free unlabeled nucleotides would compete with the
dissociated and diluted 8-azido-[32p]atp.
the interaction of sulfonylureas with  xxxg19xxx  abolishes the
stimulatory effect of mgadp on katp channels (10). however, the sensitivity of the  xxxg1253xxx  to sulfonylureas is
increased more in the presence of mgadp than in its absence
(16–18). mgatp, like mgadp, is able to stimulate the activity
of katp channels containing a mutation (r50g) in  xxxg1250xxx  that
impairs atp inhibition (13). the degree of mgadp activation
of katp channels is greater than that of mgatp activation,
which occurs over the same concentration range (0.1–1 mm).
both of these effects are abolished, however, when mutations
are made in the nbfs of  xxxg19xxx  (13). our biochemical findings
that  xxxd2215xxx  abolishes the potentiating action of
mgadp on photoaffinity labeling and that the inhibitory
action of  xxxd2215xxx  is increased in the presence of mgadp
are consistent with these electrophysiological findings.
the present study thus shows that positive interaction
between the two nbfs of  xxxg19xxx  is important for katp-channel
regulation. cooperative interaction of the two nbfs of abc
proteins has been shown for p-glycoprotein (22–24) and for the
 xxxg437xxx  (cftr;

biochemistry: ueda et al.
refs. 25 and 26). both of the nbfs of p-glycoprotein and of
cftr seem to hydrolyze atp and alternate in catalysis
(25–27). for p-glycoprotein, the roles of the two nbfs may be
equivalent (27), but the cooperativity between the two nbfs
is very strong; a mutation or modification in either of the two
nbfs in p-glycoprotein blocks atp hydrolysis by the other,
intact nbf (23). however, in cftr, the roles of the two nbfs
may not be equivalent; nbf1 is thought to be involved in
channel opening, whereas nbf2 is thought to be involved in
channel closing (25, 26). cooperativity between the two nbfs
is induced by phosphorylation of the regulatory domain by
 xxxg1836xxx , which is also necessary for channel opening
(26). however, cftrs bearing a mutation in either of the two
nbfs still function as channels even though the gating kinetics
are altered (25, 26).
we propose the following model of nucleotide activation of
the  xxxg1253xxx  through the  xxxg19xxx  subunit (fig. 7). channel
activation is induced when  xxxg19xxx  binds atp in nbf1 and
mgadp in nbf2 (state 1). when the intracellular mgadp
concentration decreases, mgadp dissociates from nbf2
(state 2). mgadp interacts with nbf2 either by direct binding
or by hydrolysis of bound mgatp (state 3). states 1 and 2 are
states of equilibrium, and most of the  xxxg19xxx  subunits will be
in state 1 at high mgadp concentrations and in state 2 at low
mgadp concentrations. mgadp dissociation from nbf2
leads to instability of atp binding at nbf1, allowing the
release of atp (state 4). this dissociation of atp from nbf1
may be involved in channel inactivation of the katp channels
seen in excised patches. under physiological conditions, the
intracellular atp concentration is high enough, and atp
bound to nbf2 is hydrolyzed readily to adp. consequently,
 xxxg19xxx  is in states 1, 2, or 3. the amount of the photoaffinitylabeled  xxxg19xxx  (probably in state 1) was directly proportional
to the concentration of mgadp from 10 mm to 1 mm (fig. 3).
these results suggest that the intracellular concentration of
mgadp is the primary factor determining the alteration
between the active state (state 1) and the inactive state (state
2) of  xxxg19xxx . atp binding at nbf1 is required for the action
of  xxxg19xxx , and the intracellular concentration of atp also
could affect the equilibrium.  xxxg19xxx  in state 2 or 3 cannot
induce channel activation and allows the  xxxg1250xxx  subunits to
close. atp is also predicted to bind preferentially to  xxxg1250xxx  in
the closed state (28). importantly,  xxxd2215xxx  may well
convert an active state of  xxxg19xxx  directly into the inactive state
by dissociating atp from nbf1 (state 5).  xxxd2215xxx 

proc. natl. acad. sci. usa 96 (1999)

causes the release of atp from nbf1, in cooperation with
mgadp at nbf2. the active state of  xxxg19xxx  (state 1) has
similarities to that proposed for cftr (26, 29), although
mgadp binds at nbf1 whereas atp binds at nbf2.
when membrane was incubated for 15 min in the presence
of mg21 at 0°c or in the presence of mgadp or mgatp at
37°c, the efficiency of photoaffinity labeling with 8-azido-[g32p]atp was increased significantly (fig. 4). this result suggests that the conformational change in nbf1 transduced by
mgadp binding to nbf2 could stabilize atp binding at
nbf1. mg21 binding to nbf2 might also transduce a conformational change in nbf1 to some extent, because mg21 alone
only weakly stabilizes 8-azido-atp binding at nbf1 (fig. 2)
and because photoaffinity labeling was increased significantly
in the presence of mg21 at 0°c (fig. 4).
in conclusion, the two nbfs of  xxxg19xxx  show strong cooperativity in nucleotide binding. indeed, katp-channel activation
may be induced primarily by the cooperative interaction of
atp binding at nbf1 and mgadp binding at nbf2. the
intracellular concentration of mgadp is the primary factor in
the determination of the active state of  xxxg19xxx , although atp
is required for the action of  xxxg19xxx . the direct biochemical
investigation of the mechanism of action of  xxxd2215xxx  on
 xxxg19xxx  also shows that sulfonylureas act in cooperation with
mgadp at nbf2. such cooperative interaction of the two
nbfs is also important in the function of other abc proteins,
such as p-glycoprotein and cftr (22–26), and thus deserve
investigation as an appropriate target for various therapeutic
drugs. the katp channels in other tissues, which comprise
 xxxg1250xxx  subunits and other sur subunits, have differing sensitivities to sulfonylureas and k1-channel-opening drugs (30,
31). other abc proteins may also be involved in the regulation
of certain k1 channels (32, 33). variations in the cooperativity
of the two nbfs in abc proteins could account for the
differences in function of the various abc proteins as transporters, ion channels, or ion-channel regulators.
