serine palmitoyltransferase, a key enzyme of sphingolipid metabolism.  the first step in the biosynthesis of sphingolipids is the condensation of serine and  xxxd2832xxx  coa, a reaction catalyzed by serine palmitoyltransferase (spt) to produce 3-ketodihydrosphingosine (kds). this review focuses on recent advances in the biochemistry and molecular biology of spt. spt belongs to a family of pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (plp)-dependent alpha-oxoamine synthases (poas). mammalian spt is a heterodimer of 53-kda  xxxg2194xxx  and 63-kda  xxxg2195xxx  subunits, both of which are bound to the endoplasmic reticulum (er) most likely with the type i topology, whereas other members of the poas family are soluble homodimer enzymes.  xxxg2195xxx  appears to be unstable unless it is associated with  xxxg2194xxx . potent inhibitors of spt structurally resemble an intermediate in a probable multistep reaction mechanism for spt. although spt is a housekeeping enzyme, its activity is regulated transcriptionally and post-transcriptionally, and its up-regulation is suggested to play a role in apoptosis induced by certain types of stress. specific missense mutations in the human  xxxg2194xxx  gene cause hereditary sensory neuropathy type i, an autosomal dominantly inherited disease, and these mutations confer dominant-negative effects on spt activity.
