abstract—starting from 3-aza-6,8-dioxa-bicyclo[3.2.1]octane scaﬀold (btaa) a virtual library of molecules was generated and
screened in silico against the crystal structure of the human  xxxg1421xxx  ( xxxg1421xxx ). the molecules obtaining high
score were synthesized and the aﬃnity for the catalytic domain of  xxxg1421xxx  was experimentally proved by nmr experiments. a
btaa scaﬀold 20 having a  xxxd2304xxx  group in position 3 and a p-phenylbenzylcarboxy amide in position 7 showed a fair inhibition potency (ic50 = 149 lm) for  xxxg1421xxx  and some selectivity towards ﬁve diﬀerent mmps. these results, taken together with
the x-ray structure of the adduct between  xxxg1421xxx , the inhibitor 20 and the  xxxd66xxx  (aha), suggest that bicyclic
scaﬀold derivatives may be exploited for the design of new selective matrix metalloproteinase inhibitors (mmpis).

1. introduction
matrix metalloproteinases (mmps) are a family of zincdependent, calcium containing, endopeptidases involved
in extracellular matrix degradation and, consequently,
they play a crucial role in physiological processes such
as tissue remodelling and healing of wounds.1 as the
upregulation of mmps is involved in many inﬂammatory, malignant and degenerative diseases,2 attempts to design and develop inhibitors that may modulate their
regulation have become of great interest.3–5
the main requirement for a small molecule to be an
eﬀective metalloproteinase inhibitor (mmpi) is the presence of both a functional group capable of chelating the
active-site zinc ion and a lipophilic residue able to ﬁt
into the s01 pocket.4 hydroxamic acid is the most popular zinc binding group (zbg) for mmpis even if some
authors report that it is fast metabolized in vivo6,7 and

it contributes to increase toxicity due to its low metal
binding selectivity.8
the inhibitors designed up to date usually bind the active site on the catalytic domain providing nanomolar
dissociation constants.3,4 however, several inhibitors
exhibit a poor selectivity as a consequence of the high
structural similarity among the members of the mmp
family.9 even if the low speciﬁcity does not prevent
the use in vivo, it raises a lot of side eﬀects and it also
limits the dose that may be daily administered.10,11 as
a consequence, the search of new potent and selective
mmp inhibitors still represents an important pharmaceutical target.
even if the expensive high-throughput screening of small
molecule libraries is one of the most popular approaches
in pharmaceutical research, alternative strategies, based
on docking calculation and rational drug design, may be
adopted if the 3d structure of the target is solved.12–14
a new class of molecular heterocyclic scaﬀolds (btaa)
based on 3-aza-6,8-dioxa-bicyclo[3.2.1]octane skeleton,15 which can be decorated with a zbg and a

lipophilic residue, was chosen to design selective  xxxg1421xxx  inhibitors (fig. 1).

lows to score the docking results in order to identify a
class of potential ligand.17

the main feature of these scaﬀolds is their tridimensional bicyclic skeleton generated by combination of sugar
and amino acid derivatives. their synthesis includes
only few steps starting from commercially available
enantiopure precursors and a stereochemistry control
can be accomplished in each step of the synthesis. as
dipeptide isosteres, btaas are compounds with potential biological activity and their use as central core of
pharmaceutical targets is convenient as a high number
of positions can be functionalized leading to molecular
diversity. limited ﬂexibility can be advantageous to correctly direct the pharmacophore side chains and it is also
useful for computational analysis. in addition, as amino
acids, they have full compatibility with the conditions
required for solid-phase synthesis.15,16

moreover, the experimental assessment of the aﬃnity of
few selected molecules outlined by docking results gives
the chance to correlate binding energies and binding
constants improving the prediction reliability. a combined use of virtual screening and experimental determination of the binding aﬃnity suggested that the btaas
may represent a new type of scaﬀolds to design a new
class of mmpis.
2. chemistry
the synthesis of 3-biphenyl-4-ylmethyl-3-aza-6,8-dioxabicyclo[3.2.1]octane-7-carboxylic acid methyl ester (pphbn-btgome) (8) was carried out following a procedure previously reported for similar compounds and is
brieﬂy reported below scheme 1.12

all these properties, together with fair solubility and low
molecular weight, were considered in scaﬀold selection.

reductive alkylation of aminoacetal 1 with biphenyl-4carbaldehyde (2) and nabh4 aﬀorded in good yield
the aryl aminoacetal 3 which was subsequently converted into the amide 5 by treatment with (r,r) tartaric
anhydride18 4. crude 5 was treated with thionyl chloride
in meoh aﬀording cyclic acetal 6, which was submitted
to the acid-catalyzed cyclization to give 7 in 40% yield
over the four steps. reduction of amide 7 with
bh3me2s furnished the corresponding amine 8 in
70% yield (scheme 1).

diversiﬁcation of btaas by easy decoration with diﬀerent functional groups may generate virtual libraries
which may be screened in silico in order to identify
new hit compounds for further lead discovery. even if
the binding energy provided by docking programs does
not reﬂect exactly the real binding aﬃnity, its value al-

basic hydrolysis of 7 and acid-catalyzed hydrolysis of 8
gave, respectively, the free acids 9 and 10 in good yields.

a peculiar feature of btaas is the demonstrated high
reactivity of their methyl ester function towards amines,
although simple esters are usually not very reactive towards direct aminolysis.19 owing to this, hydroxamic

the availability of high-resolution structure of the
 xxxg1421xxx  catalytic domain22,23 provided the possibility
to employ a structure-based approach to design and
screen a virtual library.

a biphenylic moiety and a hydroxamic (or carboxylic)
acid were chosen as good substituents24 to be introduced
in diﬀerent position of btaa and hundreds of structures
were so generated and tested in silico for their aﬃnity to
the catalytic domain of  xxxg1421xxx .

the hits with the highest score were selected and, among
them, compounds 9-12 were synthesized due to their
higher feasibility. in this class of molecules the scaﬀold
supports the biphenylic moiety in front of the zbg.
the autodock binding model predicted a deep insertion
of the biphenyl group into the s01 cavity though the coordination geometry of the zbg appeared not to be
optimized.

to prepare the model compound 15 having a  xxxd2304xxx  as zinc-binding group, piperidine 13 was
treated with triphosgene and then with benzyl-hydroxylamine and net3 aﬀording compound 14. the debenzylated product 15 was readily obtained by mild
hydrogenolytic cleavage of the protecting group over
5% pd/c at 1 atm (scheme 3).20

dissociation constants (kd) of compounds 9–12 were
calculated through 15n–1h hsqc experiments.25 in
addition, compounds 21–24, already present in our
chemical library, were submitted to the same experiments in order to compare the results and support the
docking model.

a new btaa scaﬀold 20 having the  xxxd2304xxx 
group in position 3 and the p-phenylbenzylcarboxy
amide in position 7 was then prepared. due to the high
reactivity of ester 16, the biphenyl derivative 17 was easily
and quantitatively prepared by stirring the starting material at 60 c with a neat excess of amine. debenzylation
was carried out by reﬂuxing a solution of 17 in meoh
in the presence of ammonium formate and catalytic pd/

moreover, the inhibitory activity (ic50) of compounds
9–12 was measured by enzymatic assays.26

perturbation upon the addition of 12.

since the identiﬁcation of the amino acids involved in
the binding may be crucial to prove a direct interaction
with the catalytic site and, consequently, for the optimization of the process, nmr-based strategies were also
used to localize the binding site on the target.27 the
identiﬁcation of the binding site was easily performed
analyzing the protein resonance chemical shifts in
1
h–15n hsqc spectra, recorded either in presence or
in absence of the ligand.28
the pattern of the shifts was similar for all ligands. several residues forming the s01 cavity, one or more zinc
binding histidines and the neighbouring amino acids
are strongly inﬂuenced by the presence of this class of
molecules. as example, a ribbon representation of
 xxxg1421xxx  is shown in figure 2. the nhs showing significant chemical shift perturbation upon the addition of
compound 12 are highlighted. the aﬀected amino acids
nicely deﬁne the ligand binding site that is the same for
all the designed compounds in agreement with the docking results. only few diﬀerences were found among the

members of this class. in particular, the nh cross-peak
of his218 was only weakly shifted by lactams 9 and 11
with respect to compound 12.
the analysis of the results summarized in table 1 suggests that the bicyclic skeleton of btaa should be compatible with the metalloelastase catalytic domain, but
the activity is strongly modulated by the type and
position of the substituents. hydroxamic acids 11, 12
(ic50 = 425 lm, 399 lm, respectively) are more potent
than the carboxylic ones 9, 10 (ic50 = 954 lm,
835 lm, respectively). the aﬃnity observed within this
series seemed to be highly dependent on the presence
of the biphenylic moiety: the replacement of the biphenylmethyl with a benzylic-protecting group resulted in
a loss of binding aﬃnity, so compounds 21 and 22
(kd p 10 mm) are almost inactive; and the introduction of the hydroxamic moiety in position 7 did not
restore the activity (see compound 23). otherwise, the
presence of the zbg and the lipophilic residue in vicinal
position decreases the binding aﬃnity as demonstrated

7396

c. mannino et al. / bioorg. med. chem. 14 (2006) 7392–7403

by compound 24 for which no detectable interactions
were found by nmr.
with these results in our hands we decided to focus our
eﬀorts on the design of new derivatives with improved
aﬃnity. a deeper penetration in the s01 cavity was possible moving the biphenyl group quite far from the scaffold. due to the high reactivity of the btaa methyl
ester, it was synthetically very easy to introduce the
biphenylic moiety in 7 through an amide bond. as a
consequence, the best anchoring point for the zbg
resulted in the n-3 giving rise to a  xxxd2304xxx  (compound 20). the use of this functional group as metal
chelator in mmp inhibitors has been previously reported6 and recently validated by a x-ray structure.31
in order to determine the aﬃnity of the  xxxd2304xxx 
moiety, the model compound 15 was tested in silico and
synthesized (see scheme 3).
the in silico model suggested that the interaction of 15
with the active site is limited to the catalytic zinc and
to the entrance into the s01 subsite. the structure of
the adduct shows the same coordination scheme of the
hydroxamic acid which is able both to chelate the
active-site zinc ion and to provide a hydrogen bond
interaction with the enzyme backbone. the protonated
oxygen atom (o4) is involved in a strong hydrogen bond
with carboxylate oe2 of glu219, while the nh shows
weaker electrostatic interaction with the ala181 carbonyl oxygen.
to determine the binding aﬃnity for the  xxxg1421xxx  catalytic domain, we analyzed the alteration of the chemical
shifts induced on 2d 1h–15n hsqc upon the titration
with the  xxxd2304xxx  derivative 15. the ﬁt of the
experimental data provided a dissociation constant of
3.4 mm. the binding mode predicted in silico is supported by the pattern of resonance frequencies shifted
as a consequence of the interaction. the nh signal corresponding to his218 is strongly aﬀected by millimolar
concentration of the ligand (fig. 3), while only few
residues forming the s01 cavity are weakly inﬂuenced.
since the metal binding capability of the  xxxd2304xxx 
was conﬁrmed, the new scaﬀold 20 was synthesized. (see
scheme 4)
the 1h–15n hsqc spectra for 20 showed a pattern of
shifts similar to compounds 9–12 indicating for all these
molecules the same binding site (fig. 4).
a diﬀerent eﬀect on the zinc binding histidine with respect to the  xxxd2304xxx  prototype is probably present since the shift perturbation involved mainly his222
instead of his218. the ﬁt of dd as a function of the
ligand concentration provided a kd of 154 lm, in good
agreement with the ic50 value of 149 lm obtained by
the enzymatic assay (fig. 4).
to probe the selectivity towards  xxxg1421xxx ,  xxxd2304xxx  20 was also tested by ﬂuorescence enzymatic experiments for the inhibition of collagenases ( xxxg1418xxx ,

 xxxg1439xxx ,  xxxg1422xxx ),  xxxg1438xxx  1 ( xxxg1438xxx ) and  xxxg1419xxx  ( xxxg1419xxx ) and the corresponding data are summarized in table 2. compound 20 is a fairly selective
 xxxg1421xxx  inhibitor since it possesses limited activity
against the other mmps especially the  xxxg1418xxx  and
 xxxg1438xxx . these two enzymes diﬀer from other mmp
family members since they have a relatively small s01
pocket which presumably cannot accommodate the
large biaryl substituent.
although compound 20 exhibits an improved aﬃnity
towards  xxxg1421xxx , nevertheless the micromolar value
of kd demonstrates that all the planned interactions
are not optimized. the x-ray structure of the  xxxg1421xxx –20 complex (pdb code: 2hu6) provided a direct
inspection on ligand–protein interactions (fig. 5a).
as correctly predicted by the nmr studies the molecule binds the metalloelastase at the catalytic site, ﬁtting the biaryl moiety into the s01 pocket. the
electron density of the inhibitor is well deﬁned because
it is held in place by two hydrogen bonds with pro238
and leu181 of the enzyme backbone. however, the
contribution of the hydroxyurea to the binding is absolutely negligible since it points towards the exterior of
the active site and does not interact with the catalytic
zinc ion.
noteworthy, the zinc ion is coordinated by the weak
inhibitor  xxxd66xxx  (aha) present, as stabilizer, in the crystallization buﬀer. this would suggest that
the lack of interaction between the hydroxyurea and the
catalytic zinc, evidenced in the crystal structure, is due
to the competition with the high concentration of aha.
in order to investigate this point, an energy minimization of the ligand was performed after removing aha
from the pdb and blocking the biaryl group in the crystal structure conformation. the amber-8 minimized
model indicates that the hydroxyurea function could

therefore, these data suggest that the anchoring point

zbg.
the adducts provided by docking calculation enabled
the identiﬁcation of the catalytic pocket of  xxxg1421xxx  as
the binding site for this class of compounds. the inspection of the residues showing a signiﬁcant chemical shift
perturbation supports this picture, with the lipophilic
moiety ﬁtted into s01 cavity and the bicyclic skeleton
located outside, in front of the catalytic zinc.

4. conclusion
new compounds with aﬃnity for the catalytic domain
of the  xxxg1421xxx  were designed using an integrated
approach based on virtual screening and on nmr
analysis. the molecules are built around a btaa scaf-

among the synthesized compounds, the scaﬀold 20 having the  xxxd2304xxx  group in position 3 and the
p-phenylbenzylcarboxy amide in position 7 showed an
improved aﬃnity (kd = 154 lm and ic50 149 lm) for
 xxxg1421xxx  and some selectivity towards the other mmps.

c. mannino et al. / bioorg. med. chem. 14 (2006) 7392–7403

the x-ray structure of the catalytic domain of human
 xxxg1421xxx  in the presence of hydroxyurea derivative 20 gave more insight into the ligand–enzyme interaction and appeared as a new starting point
for further  xxxg1421xxx  inhibitors’ designing.
new fragments may be easily inserted in the bicyclic
scaﬀold to better interact with the enzyme backbone
and to selectively accommodate into the binding pocket
of  xxxg1421xxx . therefore, the synthetic versatility of
btaas, taken together with dissociation constant in
micromolar range and fair selectivity, candidate these
molecules as new compound guides to develop more potent and selective inhibitors for  xxxg1421xxx .
5. methods
docking calculations were performed using the
lamarckian genetic algorithm (lga) of the program
autodock 3.032 which, using principles of natural evolution mutations and cross-over, probes the designed molecules on the three-dimensional structure of the target
macromolecule. in this work, the crystal structure of
the catalytic domain of  xxxg1421xxx  (pdb code:  xxxd1109xxx ),
processed by autodocktools, was used as target protein. the three-dimensional structures of the designed ligands, generated by chem3d pro program, were
minimized by semiempirical calculations and the gasteiger-marsili charges33 assigned by the program babel. in
order to include all the active site, a box of
19.75 · 19.75 · 19.75 å3, centred near the catalytic zinc
and with a grid spacing of 0.275 å, was selected as docking space. a total of 50 runs were performed for each
ligand and the results were ranked according to the
docking energy.
the cdna, encoding the fragment gly106-gly263
(f171d mutant)34 of the  xxxg1421xxx ,
was cloned into the pet21 vector (novagen) using ndei
and bamhi as restriction enzymes and then transfected
into e. coli strain bl21 codon plus cells. uniform 15nlabelled protein was expressed by induction with
0.5 mm iptg at 37 c for 4 h in m9 minimal media
containing 15 mm (15nh4)2so4.
the inclusion bodies, containing the protein, were solubilized in a buﬀered solution with 20 mm tris–hcl and
8 m urea at ph 8. the protein was then puriﬁed with a
size-exclusion chromatography (pharmacia hiload
superdex 75 16/60) in 6 m urea and 50 mm sodium acetate. a second step of puriﬁcation was performed on
cation exchange column mono-s (pharmacia) using a
linear gradient of nacl up to 0.5 m.
the protein was refolded by using a multi-step dialysis
against solution containing 50 mm tris–hcl (ph 7.2),
10 mm cacl2, 0.1 mm  xxxd3556xxx , 0.3 m nacl and decreasing concentrations of urea (from 4 m up to 2 m). the

h–15n hsqc experiments, implemented with the sensitivity enhancement scheme,35 were recorded at 298 k
on a bruker drx 700 operating at proton nominal frequency of 700.21 mhz. the nmr experiments were
performed on samples containing 0.1 mm of 15nenriched  xxxg1421xxx  in 10 mm tris–hcl buﬀer, 10 mm
cacl2, 0.1 mm  xxxd3556xxx , 0.3 m nacl and 0.2 m  xxxd66xxx  at ph 7.2.

the compounds were evaluated for their ability to inhibit the hydrolysis of ﬂuorescence-quenched peptide
substrate
mca-pro-leu-gly-leu-dpa-ala-arg-nh2
(biomol, inc.). the assays were performed in 50 mm
hepes buﬀer, containing 10 mm cacl2, 0.05% brij35, at ph 7, using 1 nm of proteolytic enzyme (catalytic
domains of  xxxg1418xxx ,  xxxg1438xxx ,  xxxg1439xxx ,  xxxg1419xxx ,
 xxxg1421xxx ,  xxxg1422xxx ) and 1 lm of peptide. the enzyme
was incubated at 25 c with increasing concentration
of inhibitor and the ﬂuorescence (excitationmax
328 nm; emissionmax 393 nm) was measured for 3 min
after the addition of the substrate using a varian
eclipse ﬂuorimeter. fitting of rates as a function of
inhibitor concentration provided ic50 values (see table
1). the inhibitor  xxxd1109xxx  (biomol, inc.) was used as
control.
crystals of human  xxxg1421xxx , already containing aha
from the refolding process, grew at 20 c from a
0.1 m tris–hcl, 30% peg 6000, 200 mm aha,
1.0 m licl2 solution at ph 8.0 using the vapour diﬀusion technique. the ﬁnal protein concentration was
about 10 mg/ml. soaking procedure was implemented
in order to allow the inhibitor binding; 20 was added
in the powdered form directly into the drop using a needle and was left incubating for a few days. the data were
measured exploiting synchrotron radiation at the beamline id23-1 (esrf, grenoble, france). the dataset was
collected at 100 k and the crystal used for data collection was cryo-cooled without any cryo-protectant treatment. the crystal diﬀracted up to 1.3 å resolution and
belongs to space group c2 (a = 51.25 å, b = 60.18 å,
c = 53.97 å, a = c = 90, b = 114.59) with one molecule
in the asymmetric unit, a solvent content of about 50%
and a mosaicity of 0.7. the data were processed in all
cases using the program mosflm36 and scaled using
the program scala37 with the tails and secondary corrections on (the latter restrained with a tie
surface command) to achieve an empirical absorption correction.
table 3 shows the data collection and processing statistics for all datasets. the structure was solved using the
molecular replacement technique; the model used was
that of the  xxxg1421xxx –aha adduct (1y93) from where
