abstract—the synthesis of simpliﬁed analogs of the novel isoquinoline alkaloid stephaoxocanidine, carrying the oxazaphenalene
abc-ring system of the natural product, and their activity as inhibitors of the enzyme acetylcholinesterase, are reported. 5,6-dimethoxy-7h -8-oxa-1-aza-phenalen-9-one (5) was as active as a narcissus extract enriched in galantamine.

the critical role of acetylcholine in cognitive function
and the fact that cholinergic stimulation enhances performance of cognitive tasks in man and animals,1 suggested that therapy with cholinomimetic agents may
improve cognitive and memory deﬁcits observed in alzheimers disease. accordingly, to date cholinesterase
inhibitors are the only class of compounds with proven
eﬃcacy in the treatment of the cognitive and functional
symptoms of this disease, and became the cornerstone of
its therapy.2
galantamine (1), a natural benzazepine alkaloid,3 and
tacrine (2), a synthetic quinoline derivative, are among
the ﬁrst four medications approved by the fda for
the symptomatic treatment of mild to moderate alzheimers disease.
the stephaoxocanes (fig. 1) are a small family of isoquinoline alkaloids recently uncovered by japanese,4
chinese5 and brazilian 6 scientists, which share the tetracyclic skeleton 4a. to date, only ﬁve members are
known: stephaoxocanidine (4b) and stephaoxocanine

keywords: acetylcholinesterase inhibitors; oxazaphenalenes; stephaoxocanes; isoquinoline alkaloids.

s. excentrica5 and eleteﬁne (4c) isolated from cissampelos pareira.6 these are menispermaceae which have long
found use in folk medicine.
the roots of cissampelos species are widely used in
indigenous and popular medical systems to cure heart,
genital and urinary illnesses as well as respiratory diseases such as cold and asthma,7 while s. cepharantha
hayata has been used in chinese medicine for the treatment of diseases such as parotiditis, gastric ulcer and
leukopenia.8
the genus stephania is proliﬁc in bioactive compounds.
s. cepharantha has been recorded to produce cepharanthine and cycleanine, with activity on acetylcholine
receptors.9 recently, interesting acetylcholinesterase
inhibitory activity was found in s. suberosa forman extracts, employed in thai traditional neurotonic and rejuvenating medicine,10 while stephania rotunda has been
used in oriental medicine as treatment for dysautonomia (abnormal functioning of the autonomic nervous
system). furthermore, root extracts of s. venosa, a thailand prescription for memory improvement in elderly,
strongly inhibited acetylcholinesterase (90% inhibition
with a 0.1 mg/ml extract)11 and bisbenzyl-isoquinolines
from stephania tetrandra have also shown acetylcholinesterase inhibitory properties.12

of traditional medicine information on drug development has received considerable interest.16 the chemistry
and biological activity of the stephaoxocanes is an unexplored area; thus, we have developed two diﬀerent approaches for the elaboration of the abc ring system
of stephaoxocanidine17 and prepared compounds 5
and 6.
herein, we report the synthesis of tricyclic simpliﬁed
analogs of stephaoxocanidine, some of which bear functionalized alkyl chains in place of its oxocane ring d,
and their in vitro activity as inhibitors of the enzyme
acetylcholinesterase. the synthesis was straightforward
starting from the known oxazaphenalene lactone 5, easily available from 2,3-dimethoxy toluene (7). addition
of allylmagnesium bromide at 20 c furnished 85%
of hemiacetal 8, which was treated with trimethyl orthoformate under  xxxd1526xxx  catalysis, furnishing the corresponding methyl acetal 9 in 83% yield (see scheme 1).

interestingly, besides galantamine other alkaloids such
as isoquinoline derivatives from amarillidaceae13 as well
as protoberberines,14c and quaternary benzophenanthridine and isoquinoline alkaloids14 including sanguinarine
(2)14b–d and n-alkyl carneginium salts, have been shown
to display acetylcholinesterase inhibitory activity.15

the use of ch2cl2 at 20 c as reaction condition for
grignard addition to 5 is remarkably unusual; nevertheless, this is a result of the poor solubility of lactone 5 in
thf and et2o as well as in aromatics such as toluene,
which prevented their use as solvents in this transformation. the lactone was only sparingly soluble in ch2cl2
at 20 c and the reaction did not proceed at temperatures below 35 c due to its insolubility. interestingly,
however, yields of addition product were high in spite of
the use of more than one equivalent of grignard reagent, probably due to the insolubility of the resulting
alkoxide in the reaction medium, while running the reaction at temperatures above 10 c drastically reduced
product yields.

in retrospect, the use of natural products as templates
has been the single most successful strategy in the discovery of novel medicines and in recent years the use

catalytic dihydroxylation of 8 and 9 furnished highly
polar diols 10 and 12 in moderate to good yields, without spiroketalized products,18 while exposure of 8 to an

hydroboration with bh3. thf in thf followed by solvent change and oxidation with pyridinium chlorochromate supported on alumina and in situ reduction of the
resultant aldehyde with sodium borohydride in meoh
furnished 11, albeit in only 25% yield. unfortunately,
submission of the starting allyl derivative 9 to the aluminum chloride–sodium borohydride reagent19 did not
meet with better success, providing 11 in meager 27%
yield.
on the other hand, radical bromination of oxazaphenalenone 5 with nbs in reﬂuxing carbon tetrachloride
to which catalytic amounts of aibn were added, gave
47% of bromo derivative 13 and quaternarization of
the starting oxazaphenalenone with methyl iodide in
reﬂuxing acetonitrile furnished quantitative yield of
methyl isoquinolinium iodide 14.20,21
the thus synthesized simpliﬁed analogs of stephaoxocanidine were submitted to evaluation of their ability to inhibit acetylcholinesterase22 by the method of ellman
(modiﬁed),23 with the results collected in table 1.
it was observed that lactone 5 exhibited an ic50 of
19.6 lm, a remarkable activity which is comparable to
that of a narcissus extract enriched in galantamine;
however, the activity diminished to the half in 8-bromo
derivative 13 and it was less than a quarter of the original in quaternary isoquinolinium compound 14.
compounds 8–12 are analogs in which their side chains
represent part of the oxocane-ring of the stephaoxocanes. the simplest allyl derivative 8 was also the less active one; however, a notorious improvement of enzyme
inhibition was detected when its free hydroxyl was converted to the corresponding methyl acetal 9.
compounds 10–12 were prepared taking into account
that stephaoxocanes bear a c-12 hydroxyl. glycols 10
and 12 were more active that their oleﬁnic precursors
and, as observed before, the acetal outperformed the
hemiacetal.25 curiously, however, compound 11 which
best resembles the structure of stephaoxocanidine exhibited a poor performance and none of the alcohols represented an improvement over 5. overall, the set of tested
compounds were 2–3 orders of magnitude less active

than therapeutically approved acetylcholinesterase
inhibitors such as galantamine (1) and tacrine (2).
in conclusion, seven abc-ring analogs of stephaoxocanidine have been synthesized and their activity as inhibitors of acetylcholinesterase was tested. lactone 5, the
most potent compound of this series, exhibited an activity similar to that found in narcissus extracts enriched in
galantamine. the lactone moiety does not seem to be the
main responsible for the inhibition, but it may contribute to the eﬀect found in 5, since structural modiﬁcations of the latter with retention or transformation of
the lactone moiety furnished less active compounds
but did not abolish the acetylcholinesterase inhibiting
activity. unexpectedly, however, introduction of a functionalized side chain partially resembling ring d of the
tetracyclic natural products did not improve the activity.

assay for measuring acetylcholinesterase activity: some
50 ll of acetylcholinesterase solution (0.25 u/ml) in phosphate buﬀer (8 mm k2hpo4, 2.3 mm nah2po4, 0.15 m
nacl, 0.05% tween 20, ph 7.6) and 50 ll of the sample
dissolved in the same buﬀer were added to the wells of a
microplate. the plate was incubated for 30 min at room
temperature before the addition of 100 ll of the substrate
solution [0.1 m na2hpo4, 0.5 m 5,5 0 -dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) and 0.6 mm acetylthiocholine iodide in
distilled water, ph 7.5]. the absorbance was read in a biotek instruments microplate reader at 405 nm after 3 min.
enzyme activity was calculated as a percentage compared
to a control using buﬀer and enzyme solution only. the
ic50 values were calculated from three individual
determinations.

compounds 10 and 12 were tested as diastereomeric
mixtures. no further eﬀorts were done toward separation
in view of their rather low activity.
