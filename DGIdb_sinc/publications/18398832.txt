doses, and cytotoxicity at high doses. the original studies in the 1980s used  xxxd1823xxx  as a classical anticancer drug, at its maximum clinically tolerated dose,
1500 to 2500 mg/m2 per course. at these doses,  xxxd1823xxx  was found to be active
in leukemia, but was associated with delayed and prolonged myelosuppression.
after a better understanding of epigenetics in cancer and the role of  xxxd1823xxx 
in epigenetic (hypomethylating) therapy was gained, it was reevaluated at
approximately 1/20th of the previous doses (ie, at ‘optimal biologic’ doses that
modulate hypomethylation). in these dose schedules of  xxxd1823xxx  (100 to 150 mg/
m2 per course), the drug was found to be active with manageable side effects in
patients with myelodysplastic syndromes (mds) and other myeloid tumors. optimizing dosing schedules of  xxxd1823xxx  to maximize hypomethylation (low dose,
high dose intensity, and multiple cycles) have further improved results, suggesting that  xxxd1823xxx  is an active therapy that alters the natural course of mds.
combination therapies that augment the epigenetic effect of  xxxd1823xxx  will likely
improve responses and extend its use for the treatment of other malignancies.

he development of new therapeutic strategies for myelodysplastic syndrome (mds) has been the result of extensive understanding of the pathobiology of the disease. therapeutics targeting
chromatin structure, angiogenesis, and the bone marrow microenvironment that nurtures the mds phenotype have demonstrated
significant activity and offered an opportunity to alter the natural
history of the disease.1 chromatin remodeling is a powerful mechanism of regulating gene expression and protein function.2 in
extreme states, chromatin remodeling can permanently repress
expression of a gene, a situation termed ‘epigenetic silencing.’ such
silencing is exploited by cancers to fully express the malignant phenotype.3 evidence supporting a role of epigenetic gene silencing in
tumorigenesis stems from studies revealing a large number of genes
that are silenced by aberrant dna methylation in different types of
cancers, many of which are involved in the control of cell cycle progression, apoptosis, tissue invasion, and genomic stability.
dna methylation is remarkably altered in most malignancies,
with concomitant global hypomethylation and localized hypermethylation.4 this increased methylation affects the regulatory region
(gene promoter) located in cpg islands and suppresses gene expression permanently, thereby providing cancers with an alternative to
mutations or deletions for inactivation of tumor suppressor genes

and other critical genes. leukemias and mds are
characterized by the hypermethylation and silencing
of multiple genes.5,6 several genes, including the
cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p15, have aberrant
methylation and are associated with resistance to
chemotherapy.7–9
the 2 cytosine analogs  xxxd253xxx  ( xxxd253xxx ) and  xxxd1823xxx  (5-aza-20 - xxxd1836xxx ) are
methyltransferase inhibitors that exhibited encouraging in vitro antileukemic activity.5  xxxd1823xxx  is
phosphorylated to  xxxd1823xxx  triphosphate, which
incorporates into dna, depletes dna methyltransferase, and induces replication-dependent dna hypomethylation.10,11 at high doses  xxxd1823xxx  produces
dna adducts that results in dna synthesis arrest
and cytotoxicity.10,11 at low doses it induces gene
expression profile changes that favor differentiation,
reduced proliferation, and/or increased apoptosis.12–15
this dual antitumor activity has generated significant
interest in investigating hypomethylating agents as antineoplastic drugs and biologic response modifiers.
this review details the role of  xxxd1823xxx  in the treatment of mds and other hematologic malignancies.

history of  xxxd1823xxx 
 xxxd1823xxx  (fig. 1) was first synthesized in 1964 and
its potential antileukemic activity was reported in
1968.16 interest in  xxxd1823xxx  was enhanced by preclinical studies indicating that  xxxd1823xxx  is a more
potent antileukemic agent in mice than  xxxd1790xxx ,11 and by the report of jones and taylor10
that it could induce terminal differentiation of a murine embryonic cell line. momparler et al.17 and rivard et al.18 initiated what to our knowledge were the
first clinical trials of  xxxd1823xxx  in acute leukemia.
the original studies were classic phase 1 trials that
identified the maximum tolerated dose (mtd) as
1500 to 2250 mg/m2 per course.17,18 the dose-limiting toxicity (dlt) was prolonged myelosuppression.
further clinical studies were disappointing in solid
tumors but more promising in acute myelogenous
leukemia (aml), mds, and chronic myelogenous
leukemia (cml).19 the regimens tested involved high
doses of  xxxd1823xxx  given for 1 to 7 days per course.
in patients with higher-risk mds, a low-dose schedule
(15 mg/m2 every 8 hours for 3 days 5 135 mg/m2
per course) demonstrated encouraging activity.20 the
university of texas m. d. anderson cancer center
leukemia group introduced  xxxd1823xxx  into leukemia
trials in the u.s. in 1992. after a better understanding
of its hypomethylating effects, and optimization of
dose schedules, a pivotal phase 3 study was designed
and initiated in the year 2000 to compare low-dose

 xxxd1823xxx  versus supportive care in patients with
mds.21 based on these data,  xxxd1823xxx  ( xxxd1823xxx ;
supergen, dublin, calif ) received approval from the
u.s. food and drug administration for the treatment
of mds and chronic myelomonocytic leukemia
(cmml) in may 2006.

preclinical studies with  xxxd1823xxx 
dna hypermethylation and gene silencing
aberrant dna methylation is present in many malignancies, with concomitant global hypomethylation
and localized hypermethylation.4 increased methylation affects regulatory regions located in cpg islands
and suppresses gene expression. this provides cancers with an alternative to mutations or deletions for
inactivation of tumor suppressor genes and other
critical genes. leukemias and mds are characterized
by hypermethylation and silencing of multiple
genes.5,6 this process can occur early in the disease
course and is also associated with disease progression. the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor  xxxg422xxx 
was described as a frequent target of aberrant methylation in mds, and its inactivation was associated
with an increased risk of progression to aml.7 aberrant methylation of other similar genes was also
described and was associated with resistance to therapy and tumor progression.8,9,22
dual modes of action of  xxxd1823xxx 
the antineoplastic action of  xxxd1823xxx  results from
its incorporation into newly synthesized dna. it is

an s-phase-specific agent11 and has a dual, dose-dependent mechanism of action. at high doses its cytotoxic activity is due to covalent trapping the enzyme
dna methyltransferase into dna.10,11 at lower doses
its antitumor effect is likely due to its ability to inhibit dna hypermethylation and to reactivate tumor
suppressor genes.10,11 at low doses  xxxd1823xxx  does
not block cell cycle progression of g1 phase cells into
the s-phase. low doses of  xxxd1823xxx  incorporated
into dna lead to trapping and depletion of the
enzyme dna methyltransferase. in clonogenic assays, a 1-hour exposure to a 10 mm concentration of
 xxxd1823xxx  produced loss of clonogenicity in the
same range of cells in s-phase (30–50%). a longer exposure time of 24 hours demonstrated a markedly
greater antineoplastic activity, with >95% loss of
clonogenicity with a  xxxd1823xxx  dose of 1 mm.23 the
hypomethylation induced by  xxxd1823xxx  resulted in
reexpression of tumor suppressor genes, induction of
cellular differentiation, and suppression of tumor
growth.10,24

hypomethylation and histone acetylation
 xxxd1823xxx  is phosphorylated and incorporated into
dna. it then covalently  xxxd3249xxx  methyltransferases and traps the enzyme to dna, acting as an irreversible inhibitor of its enzymatic activity.
consequently,  xxxd1823xxx  induces marked dna hypomethylation in vitro and in vivo,15 and restores
silenced gene expression. its detailed molecular
mechanism is still being deciphered. there appears
to be a cascade of biochemical events triggered by
promoter dna methylation that involve initial dna
binding proteins, which attract histone deacetylases
and histone methylases, and eventually modify histones into a silenced chromatin state.25–27 a feedback
loop is operational between dna methylation and
histone methylation, whereby each of these biochemical modifications at a given gene trigger the
other, thus creating a self-reinforcing silencing
loop.25,27 this silencing loop is interrupted by  xxxd1823xxx .  xxxd1823xxx  induces hypomethylation and reverses the silenced histone code at tumor suppressor
gene loci.17,18,22 this dual effect (hypomethylation/
histone changes) may explain the superior effect of
 xxxd1823xxx  on gene expression compared with histone deacetylase inhibitors.28  xxxd1823xxx  also has significant effects on the expression of genes not
silenced by cpg island methylation.
 xxxd1823xxx  induces the expression of p21, a gene
that has demonstrated no dna hypermethylation in
cancer.20,29 the effects of  xxxd1823xxx  on the histone
code are not limited to genes showing silencing by
promoter-associated methylation.22 in bladder cancer

cells,  xxxd1823xxx  induced rapid and substantial remodeling of the heterochromatic domains of the
 xxxg421xxx / xxxg421xxx  locus, reducing levels of dimethylated h3-k9 and increasing levels of dimethylated
h3-k4. it also increased acetylation and h3-k4 methylation at the unmethylated p14 promoter, suggesting
it can induce chromatin remodeling independently
of its effects on cytosine methylation.27 this silencing-independent activity of  xxxd1823xxx  is not well
understood. other changes may be reactive, due to
the stress of exposing cells to a cytotoxic agent.
thus, the ultimate antineoplastic mechanism of  xxxd1823xxx  may be very pleiotropic.

in vivo molecular effects of  xxxd1823xxx 
global hypomethylation after  xxxd1823xxx  therapy in
vivo was observed in early trials,30 and was studied
in more detail in recent studies in leukemia.15,31
hypomethylation after  xxxd1823xxx  was dose-dependent, peaked 10 to 15 days after the initiation of therapy, and recovered to baseline at 4 to 6 weeks. in the
aml cell line oci- xxxg1997xxx ,  xxxd1823xxx  induced the
expression of 81 of 22,000 genes; 96 genes were
down-regulated (32-fold change in expression).32
similar results were obtained with primary aml and
mds cells after treatment with  xxxd1823xxx  ex vivo
and in vivo, respectively. in contrast, significantly
fewer changes in gene expression and cytotoxicity
were detected in normal peripheral blood mononuclear and bone marrow cells or transformed epithelial cells treated with  xxxd1823xxx .32 hypomethylation
demonstrated an inconsistent association with
response, with a positive correlation in aml, but an
inverse correlation in cml. the latter inverse correlation may be due to the death of responsive-hypomethylated cells and a shift to resistant cells that
withstand more hypomethylation.
daskalakis et al.33 documented p15 demethylation in marrow dna samples in 9 of 12 patients with
mds treated with  xxxd1823xxx , and evidence of p15
gene reactivation in 4 responding patients with low
baseline expression. they also noted gene reactivation in morphologically dysplastic cells in patients
not in complete remission at the time of study,
demonstrating the in vivo effect of the drug. in a
recent study, p15 hypomethylation after  xxxd1823xxx 
was observed, but there was no correlation between
baseline p15 methylation or after therapy and
response.31
pharmacokinetics
after intravenous  xxxd1823xxx  administration, plasma
protein binding is negligible (<1%) and has an excellent distribution in body fluids. due to the nucleo-

side transport system there is rapid equilibration of
 xxxd1823xxx  between extracellular and intracellular
compartments.19,34 the plasma half-life in humans is
approximately 35 minutes due to rapid deamination
by high levels of  xxxg400xxx .18  xxxd1823xxx 
crosses the blood-brain barrier, achieving 27% to
58% of the plasma concentrations after continuous
infusion.35 the repeated administration of  xxxd1823xxx 
in patients with advanced mds as a 3-hour infusion
of 15 mg/m2 every 8 hours for 3 days does not result
in systemic accumulation of the drug, and pharmacokinetic remains unchanged from cycle to cycle.36,37
when  xxxd1823xxx  was given as a 1-hour infusion daily
for 10 days every 28 days, the plasma drug concentration-time on days 1 and 10 achieved a mean
cmax of 93 ng/ml and following a 2-compartment
infusion model. the mean short and long half-lives
were 2.7 minutes and 36.9 minutes, respectively, with
a trend of decreasing the longer half-life on day 10.38
the oral administration of cytidine analogs such as
 xxxd1823xxx  and  xxxd253xxx  is not optimal due to the
rapid decomposition in acidic conditions and high
first-pass metabolism; the reported bioavailability of
these agents ranges from 9% to 41%.35,38  xxxd1823xxx 
is initially activated by  xxxg611xxx  from a
monophosphate form to the active triphosphate
form, which is then incorporated into dna by dna
polymerase.  xxxd1823xxx  can be inactivated through
its major elimination pathway involving deamination
by  xxxg400xxx  found principally in the liver,
but also in granulocytes, intestinal epithelium, and
plasma.38 urinary clearance of intact drug accounted
for 29% of plasma clearance in mice. in humans,
total body clearance in the range of 124  19 ml/
min/kg exceeds hepatic blood flow and is explained
by extensive extrahepatic deamination.39  xxxd1823xxx  is not a substrate for the cytochrome p450
enzymes.39
 xxxd1836xxx  analogs enter cells rapidly by a
nucleoside-specific transport mechanism.19  xxxd253xxx  and  xxxd1823xxx  are activated to triphosphate
forms ( xxxd253xxx  by uridine-cytidine kinase,  xxxd1823xxx  by  xxxg611xxx ) which are subject to
degradation by  xxxg400xxx .  xxxd253xxx 
incorporates primarily into rna (80%–90%), and to a
much lesser extent into dna.40 incorporation into
rna produces disassembly of polyribosomes, altered
rna methylation, a defective acceptor function of
transfer rna, and marked inhibition of protein synthesis. in contrast,  xxxd1823xxx  incorporates primarily
into dna. its incorporation into dna results in covalent trapping of dna methyltransferase causing inhibition of dna methylation at concentrations that do
not cause major suppression of dna synthesis.39 the

more direct metabolic activation pathway to dna
incorporation of  xxxd1823xxx  makes it a more potent
compound compared with  xxxd253xxx .41,42

clinical experience with  xxxd1823xxx 
early clinical trials
a phase 1 pharmacokinetic study of  xxxd1823xxx  was
conducted in 21 patients with advanced solid
tumors.19 the drug was given at dose ranges of 25 to
100 mg/m2 infused over 1 hour every 8 hours 3 3,
and the treatment repeated every 3 to 6 weeks.
for the 75 mg/m2 and 100 mg/m2 doses, mean
peak plasma concentrations were 0.93 mm/ml and
2.01 mm/ml, respectively. there was rapid disappearance of drug from plasma with a t1/2 alpha and t1/2
beta of 7 minutes and 35 minutes, respectively. total
urinary excretion was <1% of the administered dose,
suggesting that  xxxd1823xxx  was eliminated rapidly
and largely by metabolic processes.19
initial phase 1 trials
the first clinical studies of  xxxd1823xxx  in hematologic
malignancies used 1500 to 2500 mg/m2 per
course.17,18 response rates with  xxxd1823xxx  as a single agent or in combination with other therapies
were 30% to 60%.17,18,20,24,29,43,44 in a phase 1 trial in
30 children with refractory or recurrent leukemia,
with administered  xxxd1823xxx  doses 0.75 to 80 mg/kg,
significant reductions of circulating blasts were
reported.18 using a dose of 37 mg/kg in a 36-hour
infusion, 1 complete remission was noted in a
patient with acute lymphocytic leukemia (all).17
momparler et al.17 reported similar dose-dependent
activity when  xxxd1823xxx  was given to 27 patients at
doses ranging from 31 to 81 mg/kg over 36 to
60 hours. nonhematologic toxicity was rare; no mtd
was reported. there was detection of 70% inhibition
of dna methylation, but no evidence of blast differentiation.17
despite promising activity, high-dose  xxxd1823xxx 
regimens were not pursued because of delayed and
prolonged myelosuppression. at these doses the  xxxd1823xxx  effect was likely a cytotoxic one. at lower
dose schedules (15 mg/m2 3 times a day for 3 days),
 xxxd1823xxx  was found to have encouraging activity in
mds.20 at an even lower dose (0.15 mg/kg daily over
1 hour daily for 10 days)  xxxd1823xxx  was reported to
have biologic efficacy in reactivating hemoglobin f
in patients with sickle cell disease.45 these observations, combined with the short half-life of the drug
and its absolute requirement for dna synthesis for
activity, led to a novel phase 1 trial of  xxxd1823xxx  in
patients with recurrent or refractory leukemia.31 this
study tested low-dose longer exposure schedules,

with the intent of finding an ‘optimal biologic dose’
to modulate the molecular target achieving a
response at levels lower than the classic mtd. fifty
patients (44 with aml/mds, 5 with cml, and 1 with
all) were treated with increasing doses of  xxxd1823xxx 
(5 mg/m2, 10 mg/m2, 15 mg/m2, and 20 mg/m2)
intravenously over 1 hour daily, 5 days a week for 2
consecutive weeks. the starting dose per course in
this study was 30 times less than the previous established mtd. the exposure duration was then
increased to 15 days and 20 days. the treatment was
well tolerated and responses were noted at all dose
levels. the objective response rate was 32% (16 of 50
patients). in 37 patients with aml, 5 (14%) achieved
a complete response (cr) and 3 (8%) achieved a partial response (pr). in 7 patients with mds, 2 (29%)
achieved a cr and 2 (29%) achieved a pr. in 5
patients with cml, 2 (40%) achieved a cr and 2
(40%) achieved a pr. responses were slow and gradual; the median time to response was 45 days (range,
16–70 days). the dose of 15 mg/m2 daily 3 10 was
judged to be optimally effective (11 responses in 17
treated patients; 65%); lower response rates were
noted when the dose was escalated or prolonged (2
of 19 or 11%). the low response rate at high doses
was consistent with earlier studies in which  xxxd1823xxx  at a dose of 500 to 1000 mg/m2 per course
induced cr in only 1 of 17 patients for aml recurrence (unpublished data). in this study, p15 gene
promoter dna methylation studies in peripheral
blood mononuclear cells were performed in 29
patients (including 7 patients who achieved crs or
prs), only 15 (52%) of whom (including 2 patients
who achieved crs or prs) had promoter hypermethylation at baseline consistent with gene silencing (ie,
>10% methylated). there was no correlation between
p15 methylation at baseline or after therapy and
response to  xxxd1823xxx .

phase 2 studies in mds
two large phase 2 studies of  xxxd1823xxx  in mds were
recently reported (table 1). in the studies of wijermans et al.20,46,47 in europe, 169 older patients (median age of 70 years) with intermediate-risk or highrisk mds received low-dose  xxxd1823xxx  (135 mg/m2
total dose per course). the overall response rate was
49%, and the induction mortality rate was 7%.
response rates were 51% with high-risk disease and
46% with intermediate-1 disease. improvement in
thrombocytopenia was noted in 63% of patients after
2 cycles.48 complete remissions were associated with
cytogenetic remissions.49 cytogenetic responses by
the international prognostic scoring system (ipss)
were: low-risk, 3 of 5 (60%) patients; intermediaterisk, 6 of 30 patients (20%); and high-risk, 10 of 26
patients (38%). survival was longer among patients
achieving a cytogenetic response compared with
those who did not (p 5 .02).
in a phase 2 trial of  xxxd1823xxx  in patients with
mds,50 testing both dose intensity and subcutaneous
route of administration, patients received a total
dose of 100 mg/m2 per course, and were randomized
in a bayesian design to 1 of 3 arms: 1) 10 mg/m2
administered intravenously over 1 hour daily for
10 days; 2) 20 mg/m2 administered intravenously
over 1 hour daily for 5 days; and 3) 20 mg/m2 administered subcutaneously daily for 5 days (administered as 2 subcutaneous doses). cycles were
administered every 4 weeks and response or lack of
response was evaluated only after at least 3 cycles
were given. ninety-five patients (median age of
67 years) were treated, 77 of whom had mds, and 18
of whom had cmml. thirty-two percent had
secondary mds and 66% had intermediate-2 and
high-risk disease. the median number of cycles was
71 (range, 1–18 cycles). overall, 32 patients (34%)
achieved a cr and 69 (73%) had an objective

response (cr, pr, or hematologic improvement [hi])
by the new modified international working group
(iwg) criteria.51 the 5-day intravenous schedule,
which had the highest dose intensity, was selected as
optimal. the cr rate in that arm was 39%, compared
with 21% in the 5-day subcutaneous arm and 24% in
the 10-day intravenous arm (p < .05). the high-doseintensity arm was also better at inducing hypomethylation at day 5 and at activating p15 expression at days
12 or 28 after therapy. the side effect profile was favorable and included primarily myelosuppression.
these results appear to be favorable in comparison with the contemporary historic experience at the
university of texas m. d. anderson cancer center
that included 2 cohorts. group a was comprised of
115 patients receiving intensive chemotherapy from
1995 through 2005 and matched for age, ipss, and
cytogenetics. group b was comprised of all 376
patients treated with intensive chemotherapy from
1995 through 2005 with similar entry criteria as the
 xxxd1823xxx  study.52 the cr rates were 43% with  xxxd1823xxx , 46% with intensive chemotherapy in group
a, and 52% with intensive chemotherapy in group b.
mortality at 6 weeks was 3% with  xxxd1823xxx  versus
12% with intensive chemotherapy (p 5 .002); the
3-month mortality was 7% with  xxxd1823xxx  versus
22% with intensive chemotherapy. the survival was
better with  xxxd1823xxx  versus intensive chemotherapy
in group a (median of 22 months vs 11 months; estimated 2-year survival rate of 47% vs 25% [p < .001]).
a multivariate analysis for survival in all 491 patients
receiving  xxxd1823xxx  or intensive chemotherapy
(group b) identified  xxxd1823xxx  as an independent,
favorable prognostic factor for survival (p 5 .006;
hazards ratio of 0.74).52

phase 3 studies in mds
the encouraging european phase 2 results led to a
multi-institutional randomized phase 3 trial in the
u.s.21 a total of 170 patients with mds were randomized to receive  xxxd1823xxx  at a dose of 15 mg/m2
administered intravenously over 3 hours every
8 hours for 3 days (at a dose of 135 mg/m2 per
course) repeated every 6 weeks, or best supportive
care.  xxxd1823xxx  resulted in a higher objective
response rate (17% [cr in 9% and pr in 8%] compared with a supportive care response rate of 0%
[p < .001]); 12 additional patients treated with  xxxd1823xxx  (13%) achieved hi. responses were durable
(median, 41 weeks) and observed across all frenchamerican-british classification system subtypes. the
median time to first response (cr or pr) was 3.3
months, or after 2 cycles of  xxxd1823xxx  therapy.
unfortunately, 47% of patients received 2 courses

of  xxxd1823xxx ; the median number of courses was 3.
on an intent-to-treat analysis there was a trend toward a longer median time to aml progression or
death compared with patients who received supportive care alone (median survival of 12.1 months vs 7.8
months; p 5 .16). subgroup analysis indicated a
greater benefit in ipss intermediate-2/high-risk disease (median survival of 12.0 months vs 6.8 months;
p 5 .03), and in those with de novo disease (median
survival of 12.6 months vs 9.4 months; p 5 .04). all
patients who responded to  xxxd1823xxx  had higher
quality of life scores and became red blood cell and
platelet transfusion-independent in the absence of
growth factors during the time of the response.21
therapy was well tolerated with a toxicity profile
expected for this class of agent. the most common
adverse events were related to existing and aggravated myelosuppression. grade 3 to 4 nonhematologic toxicities possibly related to  xxxd1823xxx  included
hyperbilirubinemia (12%), pneumonia (10%), and
constipation (1%).21 a phase 3 multicenter trial comparing the same dose/schedule of  xxxd1823xxx  with
supportive care in elderly patients (aged >60 years)
with mds is currently being performed by the
european organization for research and treatment
of cancer (eortc) with enrollment anticipated to be
complete in early 2008.

optimal dosing of  xxxd1823xxx 
the issue of optimal dosing of  xxxd1823xxx  is currently
under evaluation, given that it has dual activity
(hypomethylation at low doses, cytotoxicity at high
doses). the classic mtd mode of drug development
was evidently not appropriate and may have hindered earlier studies and full evaluation. favorable
responses with  xxxd1823xxx  were reported at doses 10
to 30 times lower than the classic mtd in patients
with mds.
correlative studies suggest that the in vitro observation of rapid saturation of the hypomethylation
effect (and loss of the differentiation effect) at lower
concentrations is also true in vivo.10 moreover, it was
recently shown that greater hypomethylation and
clinical efficacy were the result of a better increased
dose intensity of  xxxd1823xxx .50 the sum total of dosefinding studies suggest that 1) short bolus infusions
may be better than continuous infusion schedules, 2)
lower doses are better than high doses, and 3) dose
intensity results in higher response rates, and therefore the 5-day intravenous regimen, which has the
highest dose intensity, appears to be the most effective schedule. pharmacologically, these data could be
explained by a correlation between peak levels of the
drug and responses. simply put, a high enough dose

treatment with  xxxd1823xxx /jabbour et al.

of the drug is required for intracellular incorporation,
after which the intracellular half-life of the drug may
be long enough to achieve a therapeutic effect.
although the regimen comprised of 20 mg/m2 administered intravenously over 1 hour for 5 days every
4 weeks has demonstrated demethylation, produced
pronounced activity in mds patients, and represents
an additional therapeutic option for mds, the question remains whether greater hypomethylation can
be achieved and if responses can be increased by alternative dosing regimens. the issue of optimal treatment duration and maintenance therapy should also
be investigated.

 xxxd1823xxx  in patients with mds and disease recurrence
twenty-two patients with mds were retreated with
 xxxd1823xxx  after a median of 11 months (range, 3–27
months) from the last course of initial  xxxd1823xxx 
treatment.53,54  xxxd1823xxx  was administered in a
manner similar to the initial treatment: 15 mg/m2
was administered over 4 hours given 3 times per day
on 3 consecutive days with a total dose of 135 mg/
m2, repeated every 6 weeks. ten patients (45%)
responded; there was 1 cr, 2 prs, and 7 his (at the
time of initial treatment there were 2 crs, 4 prs, and
1 hi).53 these data suggest that disease recurrence
may have been due to treatment interruption in
some cases rather than intrinsic resistance to  xxxd1823xxx . they also suggest that longer  xxxd1823xxx  treatment duration in mds may be beneficial.
 xxxd1823xxx  after  xxxd253xxx  failure
fourteen patients were treated with  xxxd1823xxx  at a
dose of 20 mg/m2 given intravenously daily 3 5 days
after failure of  xxxd253xxx  therapy.55 their median
age was 74 years (range, 58–85 years). patients had
received prior  xxxd253xxx  for a median of 4 courses
(range, 1–9 courses). overall, 5 patients (36%)
achieved response by the iwg criteria51: a cr in 3
patients (21%), a pr in 1 patient (7%), and bone
marrow cr1/2, other hi in 1 patient (7%). improvement of thrombocytopenia was noted in 2 of 5
patients (40%) with pretreatment platelets <50 3
109/l. the median duration of remission was 5.3
months and the median survival was 6 months.
future directions
combination therapy
 xxxd1823xxx  may be combined to augment its epigenetic effect. combinations of  xxxd1823xxx  and histone
deacetylase (hdac) inhibitors are synergistic in reactivating gene expression.28 combinations with inhibitors of methylated dna-binding proteins or histone
lysine 9 methyltransferases are also attractive possi-

2347

bilities. based on in vitro synergic activity, trials
combining  xxxd1823xxx  with  xxxd3485xxx  (vpa),  xxxd3529xxx ,  xxxd1841xxx , and other hdac inhibitors are
ongoing. in vivo,  xxxd1823xxx  has been shown to sensitize cells to the effects of biologic therapy such as
retinoic acid56 and to increase the expression of
proapoptotic molecules,57 which may enhance the
efficacy of classic chemotherapeutic agents, possibly
through reversal drug resistance in selected cases.58
in a phase 1/2 study, 54 patients (48 with aml and 6
with mds) were treated with a fixed dose of  xxxd1823xxx  (15 mg/m2 over 1 hour as an intravenous infusion daily for 10 days) administered concomitantly
with escalating oral doses of vpa (which was well
tolerated at a dose of 50 mg/kg/day for 10 days).
twelve patients (22%) achieved objective responses,
including 10 (19%) crs, and 2 (3%) crs with incomplete platelet recovery (crp). among 10 elderly
patients with aml or mds, 5 patients (50%) achieved
a response (4 crs and 1 crp). induction mortality
was observed in 1 patient (2%). cytogenetic response
was documented in 6 of 8 responders. the median
duration of remission was 7.2 months; the median
overall survival was 15.3 months in responders. transient dna hypomethylation and global histone h3
and h4 acetylation were induced, and were associated with p15 reactivation.59 patients with lower
pretreatment levels of p15 methylation had a significantly higher response rate. further investigation is
needed to assess the impact of hdac inhibitors on
the efficacy of  xxxd1823xxx  and whether there is the
potential to increase response rates with the combination. a randomized phase 2 study comparing  xxxd1823xxx  alone with the combination with vpa is
currently ongoing at our institution.

uses in other diseases
low-dose  xxxd1823xxx  is an attractive therapeutic modality for several disease states, as hypermethylation
of multiple gene promoters and their subsequent
silencing has been previously reported.9,60
acute myeloid leukemia
in a study by lubbert et al.,61 51 patients (median
age, 72 years) with aml received  xxxd1823xxx  at a
dose of 135 mg/m2 administered intravenously over
72 hours, repeated every 6 weeks for up to 4 courses,
with  xxxd3417xxx  given at a dose of 45 mg/
m2/day for 28 days given during course 2 in  xxxd1823xxx -sensitive patients.61 maintenance with 20 mg/
m2 of  xxxd1823xxx  administered intravenously over
1 hour on 3 days every 8 weeks was offered to
patients completing all 4 courses. in the 29 evaluable
patients, the best response was a cr in 4 patients

(14%) and a pr in 5 patients (17%), with a median
duration of 13 weeks to best response. the median
survival was 7.5 months (range, 0.3–211 months)
and the 1-year survival rate was 24%.61 in a review of
patients on the mds phase 3 randomized trial, 12
patients treated on the  xxxd1823xxx  arm (n 5 9 patients)
and on the supportive care arm (n 5 3 patients) were
found retrospectively to have aml at baseline by central review.21 of the 9 patients treated with  xxxd1823xxx ,
5 (56%) achieved an objective response versus no
response noted on the supportive care arm.
in another study, 27 patients (median age, 69
years) with aml were treated with  xxxd1823xxx  at a
dose of 20 mg/m2 administered intravenously daily
35 every 4 weeks; 17 patients (63%) received 3
courses. the objective response rate was 26% (3 crs
and 4 crs with incomplete recovery of platelet
counts).62 a phase 3 multicenter trial comparing the
same dose/schedule of  xxxd1823xxx  with supportive
care or low-dose  xxxd1790xxx  in elderly patients (aged
>65 years) with newly diagnosed aml is currently
ongoing. trials are also evaluating the role of  xxxd1823xxx  as maintenance therapy in patients with aml.
patients with unfavorable-risk cytogenetics in first
cr or crp and patients in second cr are randomized to received  xxxd1823xxx  at a dose of 20 mg/m2
administered intravenously over 1 hour daily for
5 days or no further therapy after consolidation
treatment.  xxxd1823xxx  therapy is repeated every 4 to
8 weeks for a total of up to 12 cycles.

chronic myeloid leukemia
thirty-five patients with imatinib resistant cml (12
in chronic phase, 17 in accelerated phase, and 6 in
blastic phase) received  xxxd1823xxx  at a dose of
15 mg/m2 intravenously over 1 hour daily 3 10
doses.15 the overall response rate was 54% (34%
complete hematologic response [chr] and 20% partial hematologic responses [phr]); 6 patients
achieved a complete cytogenetic response. the
median duration of response was 3.5 months (range,
2–131 months).15 twenty-eight patients with cml
(25 with imatinib resistance, 18 of whom were in
accelerated phase and 7 of whom were in blastic
phase) received a combination of  xxxd1823xxx  at a
dose of 15 mg/m2 administered intravenously daily,
5 days a week for 2 weeks; and imatinib at a dose of
600 mg orally daily.63 chrs, phrs, and hi were
observed in 9 patients (32%), 1 patient (4%), and
2 patients (7%), respectively. major and minor cytogenetic responses were observed in 5 patients (18%)
and 3 patients (11%) patiets. the hematologic
response rate was higher in patients without bcrabl kinase mutations (10 of 19 patients; 53%) com-

pared in those with mutations (1 of 7 patients; 14%).
the median duration of hematologic response was
18 weeks (range, 4–1071 weeks).

acute lymphocytic leukemia
in vitro,  xxxd1823xxx  causes loss of cell viability and
induces apoptosis in all-derived cell lines with
known dna methylation alterations. exposure of
these cell lines to  xxxd1823xxx  results in hypomethylation and reactivation of putative tumor suppressor
genes.64 aberrant dna methylation of multiple promoter cpg islands is frequently observed in patients
with all at the time of initial presentation65 and at
recurrence.66 methylation of specific molecular pathways has been associated with poor prognosis in
patients with all.8 based on these data, investigators
are assessing the safety and activity of  xxxd1823xxx  in
patients with recurrent/refractory all.
myelofibrosis
seven patients with myelofibrosis received  xxxd1823xxx 
administered subcutaneously at a dose of 0.3 mg/kg/
day on days 1 to 5 and days 8 to 12; cycles were
repeated every 6 weeks.67 five patients were evaluable for response. of these, 2 patients achieved a
response, including 1 patient with a cr (normalization of blood counts including transfusion independence). one patient in the blast phase of
myelofibrosis had an hi in platelet counts (from
62 k/ml to 200 k/ml) with a decrease (from 2.58 k/
ml to 0.03 k/ml) noted in peripheral circulating
blasts. the other 3 patients had stable disease; 2 of
these patients remained on treatment at the time of
last follow-up and had received 4 cycles and 7 cycles of
treatment, respectively. a decrease in spleen size was
observed in 3 of 4 patients with palpable splenomegaly
at baseline. overall, there was a significant reduction in
circulating cd341 levels, with a mean decrease of
approximately 70% at day 12 of cycles 1 and 2
(p 5 .01). the treatment was associated with myelosuppression and minimal extramedullary toxicities.67
solid tumors
early clinical studies of high-dose  xxxd1823xxx  monotherapy have demonstrated limited efficacy.34,38,68–70
this finding is currently being re-evaluated using
low-dose schedules for potentiation of immune
response or resensitization to chemotherapy. in
patients with malignant melanoma and renal cell
carcinoma, interleukin-2 (il-2) activates cell apoptosis through lymphocyte stimulation. malignant cells
develop resistance to il-2 either by down-regulating
human leukocyte antigen or decreased expression of
apoptotic proteins. in a phase 1 study,  xxxd1823xxx 

treatment with  xxxd1823xxx /jabbour et al.

was administered before il-2 with the objective of
increasing protein expression. major responses were
observed in 3 of 13 patients (23%), a response rate
comparable to that noted with single-agent il-2.71

sickle cell disease
 xxxd1823xxx  increases the transcription of gammaglobulin, leading to an increase in hemoglobin f.72,73
this effect was evaluated in a phase 1/2 study of 8
patients with sickle cell disease.  xxxd1823xxx  was
administered at a dose of 0.2 mg/kg subcutaneously
1 to 3 times/week 3 2 cycles. hemoglobin levels
increased from a mean of 7.6 g/dl to 9.6 g/dl
(p < .001), and hemoglobin f levels increased from
6.5% to 20.4% (p < .0001). further studies are needed
to evaluate the long-term effects of such therapy in
patients with sickle cell disease.
conclusions
given that mds is a disease of older individuals,
aggressive therapies such as combination chemotherapy and stem cell transplantation are not realistic for
many patients. therefore, there is interest in exploring low-intensity or targeted therapies in patients
with mds, and learning how to integrate them in a
multiagent therapeutic approach.  xxxd1823xxx , at
lower dose schedules, has been reported to have significant activity in mds. this activity can be further
improved with dose schedule modulations and in
combination strategies with growth factors, hdac
inhibitors, and other combinations.  xxxd1823xxx  may
have a therapeutic role in aml in several ways: 1) as
a single agent in elderly patients not fit for intensive
chemotherapy; 2) in combinations with other agents
such as hdac inhibitors,  xxxd1790xxx ,  xxxd1722xxx ,
and gentuzumab ozogamycin; and 3) as a maintenance therapy in aml patients in cr after the completion of consolidation therapy, to reduce the
potential of disease recurrence through the prevention of dna hypermethylation/recurrence of residual
leukemia.  xxxd1823xxx  should be further explored in
cml patients alone after treatment failure of tyrosine
kinase inhibitors or in combination with  xxxg2198xxx  inhibitors, in all patients, and in patients with
other hematologic disorders. finally, there is a compelling scientific rationale to re-explore  xxxd1823xxx  in
patients with solid tumors. given the emerging
understanding of epigenetic mechanisms, the role of
 xxxd1823xxx  in multiple cancer types is just beginning
to be understood.
