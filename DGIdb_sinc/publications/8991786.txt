abstract
effects of  xxxd3564xxx  (zns) on extracellular dopamine (da), its precursor 3, xxxd2471xxx  (dopa), its
metabolites 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (dopac) and homovanillic acid (hva) levels in the striatum as well as
hippocampus of freely moving rats were studied. intracellular da, dopa, dopac and hva levels, as well as dopa
accumulation as an index of  xxxg2276xxx  activity in the rat brain in vivo, da re-uptake in the striatum and
hippocampus, and  xxxg1357xxx   xxxg1358xxx  (mao) activities were also determined. acute administrations of therapeutic zns
doses (20 and 50 m g / k g ) increased striatal extracellular dopa levels, intraceilular striatal and hippocampal dopa levels,
and stimulated dopa accumulation in both brain regions. zns also increased striatal and hippocampal intracellular as well
as extracellular da and hva levels, but decreased those of dopac levels. chronic (3 weeks) administrations of
therapeutic zns doses (20 and 50 m g / k g / d a y ) increased intracellular da, dopa, dopac and hva levels in striatum and
hippocampus. zns-induced changes were greater in intracellular levels than in extracellular levels. acute and chronic
supratherapeutic zns dose (100 mg/kg) administration decreased intracellular levels of all substances detectable in both
brain regions, and inhibited dopa accumulation. both subtypes of mao (type a and type b) activities were weakly
inhibited by zns. zns showed no effect on da re-uptake in striatum nor in hippocampus. these results suggest that
therapeutic zns doses increase dopa accumulation as well as both intracellular and extracellular da, dopa and hva
levels. however, such doses also decrease extracellular and intracellular dopac levels by enhancing da synthesis and/or
by selectively inhibiting mao-b activities. in addition, chronic therapeutic zns dose administration enhances da synthesis,
which results in increased intracellular da, its precursor and its metabolites levels. on the other hand, both acute and
chronic supratherapeutic zns dose administrations inhibit da turnover. these zns effects on da metabolism are at least
partly involved in the mechanisms of action of zns.

a study of children with generalized seizures [34].
because of the rarity of serious side effects and the
potent antiepileptic effects, zns has been considered
as one of the major aeds in japan. it has also been
suggested that zns has both mood-stabilizing effects
[12] as well as other dopaminergic side effects, such
as parkinsonisms [39] and paranoid ideation [32].
little is known to date regarding the mechanisms
of action of zns. recently zns inhibition of neuronal voltage-dependent na ÷ [6] and t-type ca 2÷
channels in the rat cerebral cortex [38] has been
reported. zns also showed specific binding sites in
the crude membrane fraction of the rat brain, and
these binding sites have been related to benzodiazepine receptors [21]. despite these observations,
the results of electrophysiological experiments have
shown that the anticonvulsant and adverse neurological effects of zns are not attributable to the modulation of y- xxxd2177xxx  (gaba) [6,14,40]. in
our previous study, zns increased extracellular
dopamine (da) levels in the rat striatum and hippocampus [26], which might result in the inhibition
of neuronal excitability [13,14]. based upon the facts
that zns increased extracellular da, homovanillic
acid (hva) and 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5h1aa) levels but decreased 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (dopac) in striatum, and further increased levels of da, serotonin (5-ht), hva and
5-hiaa but decreased dopac in hippocampus
[26,27], we suggested that zns might have an inhibitory effect on  xxxg1357xxx   xxxg1358xxx  (mao) activities, da re-uptake a n d / o r enhancement of da synthesis [26,27]. the present study, therefore, was undertaken to clarify the effects of zns on dopaminergic system by studying the zns mechanisms.

governmental agency. blood samples were drawn
from the jugular vein, and zns levels were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography
(hplc) [10].

2.2. determination of intracellular da, its metabolites and precursor levels
2.2.1. chronic administration
rats were group-housed (four rats per cage) and
given free access to food and water. body weights of
rats were measured at two-day intervals for the
duration of the experiment. their diet contained
either 0, 20, 50 or 100 m g / k g body weight/day of
zns (n = 6). after providing the zns-treated food
for 21 days, the rats were irradiated by micro-wave
 xxxd2274xxx .0 kw x 1.0 s (tmw-6402a, toshiba, japan).
2.2.2. acute administration
zero, 20, 50 or 100 m g / k g body weight zns
dissolved in saline (1 m l / k g body weight) including
20% (vol./vol.)  xxxd1896xxx  (dmso) was
injected to male wistar rats intraperitoneally (ip), 2 h
before irradiation by micro-wave  xxxd2274xxx .0 kw × 1.0 s
(n = 6).
2.2.3. acute administration with 3-hydroxybenzylhydrazine hydrochloride (nsd 1015)
as an index of  xxxg2276xxx  activity in
the rat brain in vivo, the accumulation of 3, xxxd2471xxx  (dopa) was measured 3 h after
administration of a central aromatic amino acid
decarboxylase ( xxxg618xxx ) inhibitor [4] nsd 1015 (100
m g / k g ip). graded doses of zns were administrated
intraperitoneally 1 h before the administration of
nsd 1015, and rats were irradiated by micro-wave
 xxxd2274xxx .0 kw x 1.0 s (n = 6).

2. materials and methods

2.1. experimental animals
one-hundred seventy-six male wistar rats (clea
co., japan), weighing 250-300 g, and housed under
a constant temperature (25 + 2°c) with a 12-h lightdark cycle were used for the following experiments.
experimental protocols used in this study were approved by the appropriate institutional review committee and meet the guidelines of the responsible

2.2.4. sample preparations
the rat brains were dissected according to the
method of glowinski and iverson [8]. tissues were
weighed before being frozen at -80°c. the frozen
tissues were placed into 1.5 ml eppendorf microtubes and homogenized with an ultrasonic cell disrupter (hom-100, iwaki co., japan) in 500 /xl of
chilled ice 0.2 mm perchloric acid containing 100 ng
 xxxd2401xxx  for internal standard. after centrifugation at 6,000g for 20 rain at 4°c the aqueous layer

was mixed with 150/xl of sodium acetate (1 mm) to
adjust ph 3.0 and filtered through a 0.45-/zm filter
( h l c d i s k 3, cica, japan) [23]. ten microliters of
filtrate were injected into the h p l c equipped with
an electrochemical detector (ecd-hplc) system.

2.3. determination of the extracellular da,
metabolites and precursor levels

its

2.3.1. microdialysis system
the rats were anesthetized with  xxxd2052xxx  and
placed in a stereotaxic frame. a dialysis probe (0.22
mm diameter; 3 mm exposed membrane, eicom,
japan) was implanted in the striatum (a = 0.2 mm,
l = 3.0 mm, v = - 3 . 4 mm relative to bregma) or
hippocampus ( a = - 5 . 8
ram, l = 4.8 mm, v =
- 4 . 0 mm relative to bregma) [26]. the perfusion
experiments were started 2 4 - 3 6 h after probe insertion. zns effect on the extracellular striatal and
hippocampal d a and its metabolites levels was obtained using a modified  xxxd3213xxx  solution (mrs)
composed of (in mm) 145 na ÷, 2.7 k ÷, 1.2 ca 2÷,
1.0 mg 2÷, 154.4 c i - , 0.2 ascorbate [24,26]. zns

with a 0.02 m phosphate buffer to ph 7.40 [24,26].
the mrs and nrs solutions were perfused at 2
/xl/min, and injections of dialysate into ecd-hplc
system were repeated automatically every 20 min by
autoinjector (as-10, eicom, japan). when the coefficients of variation (cv) of the data reached less
than 5% (stabilization) for 60 min, an administration
of either 0, 20, 50 or 100 m g / k g body weight zns
dissolved in saline (1 m l / k g body weight) including
20% (vol./vol.) dmso was injected (ip) ( n = 6).
the data were recorded for 120 min after zns
administration.

3.6. effects of zns on mao activities
the effects of zns on mao-a and mao-b
activities are shown in fig. 6. zns inhibited both
types of mao activities. mao-b was more extensively inhibited than mao-a with concentrations
from 300 to 1,000/xm. the ic50 values of inhibition
for mao-a and mao-b were more than 1,000 /xm
and 660 /.tm, respectively.
3. 7. comparison of change in intracellular and extracellular da and dopa levels after zns administration
the increases in intracellular striatal da and
dopa levels, and in hippocampal da 2 h after
therapeutic zns doses administrations (ip) were significantly ( p < 0.05) higher than those of the maximal extracellular striatal da and dopa, and of
hippocampal da levels from 0 to 120 min. the
decreases in intracellular striatal da and dopa and
hippocampal da levels 2 h after supratherapeutic
zns dose administrations (ip) were significantly ( p
< 0.05) lower than those of extracellular striatal da
and dopa levels, and hippocampal da after zns
administration from 0 to 120 min (fig. 7).

4. discussion
the effective dose of zns varies considerably.
the eds0 value for zns against maximal electroshock seizures (mes) was reported to be 7.9 ± 1.2
m g / k g po [40] while doses ranging from 20 to 50
m g / k g were found to be effective against several
experimental animal seizure models [11,19,42], and
22.3 m g / k g of zns was needed for eds0 against
mes at 1 h [19]. the effective plasma levels of zns
against mes in rats ranged from 10.8 to 95.0/zg/ml,
and those of clinical plasma levels are over 10
/zg/ml (about 50 /.tm), with a therapeutic range up
to 70 /zg/ml (about 330 /zm) [18]. in the present

201

study, the plasma zns levels after 20 and 50 m g / k g
zns administrations, both acute and chronic, remained within the therapeutic levels, while 100
m g / k g zns administrations, both acute and chronic,
showed supratherapeutic levels.
as an index of  xxxg2276xxx  activity in rat
brain in vivo, the dopa accumulation was measured
after central  xxxg618xxx  inhibition [4] by nsd 1015 (100
m g / k g ip). administrations of graded doses of zns
(20 and 50 m g / k g ip) 1 h before the nsd 1015 (100
m g / k g ip) increased the dopa accumulation. the
extracellular and intracellular dopa levels were increased by therapeutic doses of zns (ip). these
results suggest that acute administration of zns,
ranging from 20 m g / k g to 50 m g / k g (ip), enhances
the da synthesis. on the other hand, zns inhibits
mao-b activity (eds0 = 6 6 0 /zm), the da-todopac converting enzyme, more than mao-a activity (eds0 > 1 mm), which converts both da to
dopac and 5-ht to 5-hiaa. however, zns does
not inhibit da re-uptake within the therapeutic zns
levels from 30 to 300 /xm [18] in vitro. thus, zns
inhibits the da degradation pathway by reducing
mao-b activity. this inhibitory effect of zns on
mao activities explains our previous and present
results in which zns decreases extracellular and
intracellular dopac levels while increasing extracellular 5-hiaa levels [26] in acute experiment.
in the present study, intracellular and extracellular
striatal as well as hippocampal da, dopa and hva
levels increased, while corresponding levels of
dopac decreased with therapeutic doses of zns
acute administrations (ip). these results could be
induced by two mechanisms, i.e. enhancement of
da synthesis a n d / o r inhibition of da degradation.
whether acute zns administration enhances the
da turnover is unclear, as zns has two effects on
dopaminergic metabolisms, enhancement of da synthesis, and possible simultaneous inhibition of da
degradation. however, as a net effect of zns, decrease in da turnover is unlikely because intracellular and extracellular da, dopa and hva levels are increased by zns. the present study does not
allow for explanation of the different effects of zns
on the two major da metabolites, being an decrease
in dopac and an increase in hva. this is because
we could not determine da metabolite, 3-mt, nor
did we examine the effects of zns on catechol-o-

202

m. okada et al./ epilepsy research 22 (1995) 193-205

methyl transferase (comt) activity. however, zns
may enhance comt activity which would metabolize dopac to hva, because zns reduced dopac
levels but elevated hva levels.
supratherapeutic zns dose (ip) inhibited dopa
accumulation and decreased intracellular and extracellular da and its metabolites levels in striatum and
hippocampus. these results suggest that supratherapeutic dose of zns inhibits da synthesis and degradation leading to the inhibition of da turnover.
in our previous study, therapeutic zns doses (ip)
increased extracellular da, hva, 5-ht and 5-hiaa
levels, but decreased dopac levels in the rat striatum and hippocampus [26]. in the same study, we
suggested four possible mechanisms which might
explain the increased extracellular da levels together with decreased dopac levels, i.e. an increase in ion (e.g., ca 2÷, na ÷, k ÷) dependent da
release [24,26,29,45,46], an increase in da synthesis
[24,47], an inhibition of da re-uptake [25], a n d / o r a
decrease in da degradation [3,26].
the release of the neurotransmitter and dopa is
elicited by ca 2÷ and na ÷ dependent excitation [22],
while the releases of dopac and hva are not
mediated by ionic excitation mechanisms [26]. zns
inhibits t-type ca 2÷ channels [38], and decreases
repetitive firing by changing na ÷ inactivation kinetics [6]. these effects of zns should reduce da and
dopa release. in our previous and the present studies, however, zns enhanced da and dopa releases, and did not antagonize ca 2÷ dependent da
releases [26] nor interact with adenosine in ca1
hippocampal neurons [14]. the striatal da release is
mediated by n-type ca 2÷ channels but not by l-type
ca 2÷ channels [20,29,46]. however, the lesser extent
of extracellular increase in da and dopa releases
compared with those of intracellular increase observed in the present study suggest that the blockage
of t-type ca 2÷ and na ÷ channels by therapeutic
doses of zns may not play a major role in the
increased da release. the effect of t-type ca 2+
channels on da release is, however, not clearly
differentiated, because a pure t-type ca 2÷ channel
blocker is unknown. thus, the effects of zns on
extracellular dopa, da and hva levels in striatum
and hippocampus are considered to be caused by the
effects of zns on da metabolism.
no inhibition of mao activity was observed in

the chronic administration experiments, indicating
that the inhibition of mao activity is not a major
mechanism for the increased extracellular as well as
intracellular da levels. in the present study, downregulation of the dopaminergic system was not observed with chronic administration of zns in spite
of the elevation of da levels in acute zns administration. there is no ready explanation for this, and to
clarify this further research is needed. acute and
chronic administration of supratherapeutic doses of
zns decreased both intracellular as well as extracellular da, dopa, its metabolites levels and dopa
accumulation, indicating that zns has biphasic effects on the dopaminergic system, i.e. therapeutic
doses of zns enhance dopaminergic tone, while
supratherapeutic dose of zns inhibit da turnover.
it has been established that an enhancement of
da function reduces neuronal firing [13] and proconvulsive neurotransmitter, excitatory amino acid
(eaa) [31] releases [48]. conversely, an inhibition
of da function reduces the seizure threshold [7]. in
addition, a da precursor, l-dopa, and mixed
d 1 / d 2 receptors agonists exert anticonvulsant effects which are prevented by selective d2 antagonists [17]. therefore, these findings, together with
our present results, suggest that the antiepileptic
effects of zns are at least partially mediated by the
enhancement of dopaminergic functions. this hypothesis is further supported by the observation that
the anticonvulsive effects of zns were antagonized
by reserpine, which decreases seizure threshold [2,5].
in addition, stimulation of selective  xxxg656xxx 
function mediates anticonvulsive effects [1,17,43].
on the other hand, selective  xxxg655xxx  agonists
have yielded conflicting results, i.e. stimulation of
d1 receptors has anticonvulsive (inhibition of
epilepsy-like events [36]) as well as proconvuisive
effects (facilitation of the susceptibility to seizurepromoting stimuli [1,17]). the net effect of stimulation of both da receptors subtypes (d1 and d2) may
produce anticonvulsive effects, as has been discussed
[17], and thus the present study suggests that zns
exerts its anticonvulsive effects via the  xxxg656xxx .
to confirm this, the interactions between zns and
d1 as well as d2 receptors should be studied.
high aed (i.e. cbz and phenytoin) levels produce seizures known as 'paradoxical intoxication'. a
reduction of aed levels from toxic to therapeutic

m. okada et al./ epilepsy research 22 (1995) 193-205

ranges improves seizure control [15,28,41,44]. toxic
doses of zns also may produce paradoxical intoxication similar to cbz and phenytoin [19]. the reduction in da tone accompanying 100 m g / k g zns
administration observed in the present study may
explain the paradoxical intoxication by zns. znsinduced side effects mediated by da have been
previously reported. taira described two patients
who developed resting and postural hand tremor,
thought to be induced by anti-dopaminergic mechanisms [39]. sackellares et al. reported zns exhibited
paranoid ideation, induced by therapeutic zns levels
[32]. these zns side effects can be explained by our
present results, in which zns has opposite effects on
the da function dependent on therapeutic and
supratherapeutic plasma zns levels. in addition, zns
has been shown to improve the bipolar manic state,
the schizoaffective manic state and schizophrenic
excitement [12]. these effects of zns may be also
explained by the present study.
the selective mao-b inhibitor, l-deprenyl, decreased seizure threshold [37] or did not affect seizure
threshold [49]. however, some anticonvulsive agents,
for example 1,4-benzodiazepine derivatives, exhibited significant anticonvulsant activity in spite of
marked inhibition of mao [35]. nevertheless, inhibition of mao activities may be excluded from the
anticonvulsant mechanisms of zns.
in conclusion, our data indicate that zns has
biphasic effects on da function dependent upon the
zns doses, i.e. therapeutic doses (20 and 50 mg/kg)
enhance da function while a supratherapeutic dose
(100 mg/kg) inhibits da function. this biphasic
effect of zns on da function may account for the
anticonvulsive and mood-stabilizing effects of therapeutic doses of zns as well as side effects such as
sedation or proconvulsive effects (paradoxical intoxication) of supratherapeutic doses.
