heumatoid arthritis (ra)3 is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the autoimmune response that mainly targets
joints (1). ra develops when autoreactive t cells are
activated and recruited to joints, where they mediate synovial inflammation and eventually cause tissue destruction and cartilage
and bone invasion (1–5). previous studies have demonstrated that
synovial fluid (sf) from ra patients contains large numbers of
autoreactive t cells expressing high levels of cd45ro (4, 6),
indicating that t cells infiltrating the synovial joints of ra patients
are activated and have adopted an effector/memory phenotype (7).
adoptive transfer of synovial infiltrating t cells derived from ra
patients causes inflammatory arthritis in scid mice. partial elim-

ination or inhibition of t cells by immunosuppressive drugs or
anti-t cell abs ameliorates the disease (8). thus, it is clear that
autoreactive t cells play important roles in initiating and sustaining synovial inflammation in ra patients. however, the manner in
which these autoreactive t cells are sustained during the progression and evolution of ra remains poorly investigated.
tryptophan is an essential amino acid that is important to cell survival and proliferation (9, 10). tryptophan can be catabolized by ido,
the initial and rate-limiting enzyme of tryptophan degradation pathways, to generate kynurenine, a molecule with the ability to induce t
cell apoptosis. furthermore, deprivation of tryptophan by ido halts
the proliferation of t cells at mid-g1 phase, which, in concert with
proapoptotic activity of kynurenine, leads to diminishing t cellmediated immune responses and subsequent development of immune
tolerance (11–14). ido is expressed in various tissues in cells such as
dendritic cells (dc) and activated macrophages. although dc play a
critical role in initiating a primary t cell response (15), ido-positive
dc are seen to be important in the generation and maintenance of
peripheral tolerance via depletion of autoreactive t cells and induction of regulatory t cell responses (16). recent studies have demonstrated that increased expression of ido by tumor cells may account
for their escape from immune attack (17–19). impaired ido-mediated
tryptophan catabolism has also been observed in experimental
autoimmune disease models, including nod mice (20), in
which autoreactive t cells persist during disease progression. in
contrast, tryptophanyl-trna-synthetase (tts) is a constitutively expressed cytoplasmic enzyme with the ability to mediate the association of tryptophan with its specific trna (21). the complex of tryptophan with its trna forms a reservoir of tryptophan for protein
synthesis, which then nullifies ido-mediated deprivation of tryptophan (22, 23). however, whether disregulated tryptophan catabolism
contributes to the persistence of autoreactive t cells that then can
mediate persistent tissue injury in ra patients remains unknown.
using samples from ra patients and healthy donors, we investigated a possible mechanism by which autoreactive t cells persist

a hallmark of t cell-mediated autoimmunity is the persistence of autoreactive t cells. however, it remains to elucidate the manner
in which synovial t cells are sustained in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (ra). we found that dendritic cells (dc) and tissues
from the synovial joints of ra patients expressed higher levels of ido than dc from healthy donors. interestingly, t cells derived
from the joint synovial fluid (sf) of ra patients proliferated in response to either autologous or allogeneic ido-positive dc, an
outcome that was not affected by the addition of ido inhibitor 1-methyl- xxxd1794xxx  (1-mt). in contrast, addition of 1-mt to
the culture stimulated with allogeneic or autologous ido-positive dc significantly enhanced the proliferation of t cells derived
from peripheral blood of healthy donors or from peripheral blood of ra patients. furthermore, we found that functionally active
tryptophanyl-trna-synthetase (tts) was significantly elevated in t cells derived from the sf of ra patients, leading to enhanced
storage of tryptophan in t cells and to subsequent resistance to ido-mediated deprivation of tryptophan. the ra sf enhancement
of tts expression in t cells was blocked by mab to ifn-␥ and tnf-␣. these results suggest that the resistance of t cells to
ido-mediated deprivation of tryptophan represents a mechanism by which autoreactive t cells are sustained in vivo in ra
patients. specifically, blocking of the up-regulation of tts expression in t cells presents an avenue for development of a novel
therapeutic approach to treatment of ra. the journal of immunology, 2006, 177: 8226 – 8233.

in ra patients. we found that ra patient-derived sf contained
inflammatory factors (e.g., ifn-␥ and tnf-␣). these cytokines
were able to enhance the expression of tts in t cells, leading to
the resistance of ra patient-derived sf t cells to ido-mediated
deprivation of tryptophan. this means that blocking of tts may
prove valuable for further development of novel approaches to the
restoration of ido-mediated immune tolerance and the diminishment of autoreactive t cell-mediated chronic immune responses.

materials and methods
patient samples

cell preparation
rheumatoid sf supernatants were collected following centrifugation at
1800 rpm for 20 min and depletion of cells and particulate debris. supernatants of sf were then aliquoted and immediately stored at ⫺80°c.
mononuclear cells from pb (pbmc) and sf (sf mononuclear cells) were
isolated by  xxxd3253xxx  density gradient centrifugation (lymphoprep; axisshield poc). cells were incubated with allophycocyanin-conjugated mouse
anti-human cd3 (hit3a) mab and a mixture of mabs against lineage
markers, including fitc-labeled cd14 (m5e2),  xxxg775xxx   xxxg776xxx  (3g8),  xxxg375xxx 
(h1b19), and cd20 (2h7) mabs and pe-labeled cd56 (b159) mab.
cd3⫹ t cells and lineage-negative (lin⫺) cells (cd3⫺, cd14⫺,  xxxg775xxx   xxxg776xxx ⫺,
 xxxg375xxx ⫺, cd20⫺, and cd56⫺) were then sorted using a facs (facsaria;
bd biosciences). the lin⫺ cells were seen to be a dc-enriched population
(24). in some experiments, to avoid cd3-specific ab-mediated t cell
activation, we sorted cd4⫹ and cd8⫹ cells following the staining with
allophycocyanin-conjugated mouse anti-human cd4 (rpa-t4) and anticd8 (rpa-t8) mabs using facs. the purity of sorted cells was consistently
⬎98%, as revealed by immunofluorescence analysis.
in some experiments, ido-positive dc (termed ido⫹ dc) were generated
from healthy donor-derived pbmc, as previously described, with some modification (12, 15). in brief, monocytes separated from pbmc were cultured
for 7 days with 25 ng/ml gm-csf (r&d systems) and 50 ng/ml il-4
(r&d systems) in serum-free x-vivo15 medium (biowhittaker). optimal conditions were maintained by splitting these cultures at day 5 and
every 2–3 days replacing 50% of the medium with new medium containing fresh cytokines. the nonadherent cells from the culture were
stimulated with tnf-␣ (50 ng/ml), il-1␤ (2 ng/ml), il-6 (100 ng/ml;
peprotech), and pge2 (1 ␮g/ml; sigma-aldrich) for an additional 2– 4
days. the nonadherent (ido⫹) fraction was harvested by gentle aspiration. analysis by flow cytometry showed that ido⫹ cells constituted
up to 65% of these cells. this was determined by staining, after fixation
and permeabilization, with purified mouse anti-ido (10.1) mab
(chemicon international) and subsequently with fitc-labeled goat antimouse igg (chemicon international). all abs used for separation and
staining were purchased from bd pharmingen, unless otherwise
indicated.

quantitative pcr
total rna was extracted from the sorted cd3⫹ t cells and dc using the
guanidium thiocyanate-phenol-chloroform method modified for trizol
(invitrogen life technologies). ido transcripts were detected through
rt-pcr, whereas cdna of tts was quantified through real-time pcr technique, all with  xxxg861xxx  as control. primers for ido were as follows: forward,
5⬘-actggaggcactgattta-3⬘ and reverse, 5⬘-attagtttgtggct
ctgtta-3⬘. real-time pcr were performed using a sybr green pcr mix

and conducted with the abi prism 7900ht (applied biosystems). thermocycler conditions included an initial holding at 50°c for 2 min, then 95°c for
10 min; this was followed by a two-step pcr program: 95°c for 15 s and 60°c
for 60 s for 40 cycles. data were collected and quantitatively analyzed on an
abi prism 7900 sequence detection system (applied biosystems). the
primer sequences were designed using the primer express software version
2.0 provided with the abi prism 7900ht (tts, forward, 5⬘-gaaaggca
ttttcggcttca-3⬘ and reverse, 5⬘-cagcctggatggcaggaa-3⬘;
 xxxg861xxx , forward, 5⬘-gtgaaggtcggagtcaacg-3⬘ and reverse, 5⬘-tg
aggtcaatgaaggggtc-3⬘). the  xxxg861xxx  gene was used as an endogenous control to normalize for differences in the amount of total rna in each
sample. all values were expressed as fold increase or decrease relative to the
expression of  xxxg861xxx . the mean value of the replicates for each sample was
calculated and expressed as cycle threshold (ct; cycle number at which each
pcr reaches a predetermined fluorescence threshold, set within the linear
range of all reactions). the amount of gene expression was then calculated as
the difference (⌬ct) between the ct value of the sample for the target gene and
the mean ct value of that sample for the endogenous control ( xxxg861xxx ). relative expression was calculated as the difference (⌬⌬ct) between the ⌬ct
values of the test sample and of the control sample. relative expression of
genes of interest was calculated and expressed as 2⫺⌬⌬ct.

western immunoblot analysis
cells were harvested, pelleted by centrifugation, and resuspended in lysis
buffer. equal amounts of protein (20 ␮g) were loaded onto a 5% acrylamide stacking gel and separated by sds-page using a 10% separating
gel. following transfer of separated proteins, nitrocellulose membranes
were blocked and probed overnight at 4°c with mouse anti-ido mab
(chemicon international). the membrane was then probed for 1 h at room
temperature with goat anti-mouse peroxidase-conjugated igg (kirkegaard
& perry laboratories), and the immunoreactivity was detected by chemiluminescence. to quantify ido proteins, each band density was normalized to actin protein.

histology and immunohistochemical staining
cryosections of st from ra patients or patients with traumatic lesions
were routinely stained with h&e. for ido staining, cryosections were
fixed in 10% formalin for 10 min and then treated with mouse anti-ido
mab (chemicon international), followed by staining of peroxidaseconjugated rabbit anti-mouse igg (1:200; kirkegaard & perry laboratories), and development with 3,3⬘-diaminobenzidine. sections were finally
counterstained with hematoxylin and examined microscopically.

hplc assay
dc were cultured in the rpmi 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fcs,
100 iu/ml penicillin, 100 ␮g/ml streptomycin, and 2 mm l-glutamine
(complete medium). twenty-four hours after culture, supernatant was collected and its kynurenine concentration was measured with hplc. hplc
was performed, as previously described (25), with minor modification. in
brief, 200 ␮l of supernatant was diluted with 200 ␮l of potassium phosphate buffer (0.05 m (ph 6.0)), and protein was precipitated with 50 ␮l of
2 m trichloroacetic acid. one hundred fifty microliters of supernatants was
then injected into an rp18 column and eluted with a degassed potassium
phosphate solution (0.015 m; ph 6.4) containing 27 ml/l acetonitrile at a
flow rate of 0.8 ml/min. kynurenine was detected using a uv detector at
a wavelength of 360 nm. the values were referred to a standard curve with
defined kynurenine concentrations (0 – 60 ␮m). to analyze cellular tryptophan use, purified t cells were cultured in complete medium with 50 ␮m
added tryptophan at 37°c in 5% co2. twenty-four hours after culture, 100
␮l of supernatant was collected for determination of tryptophan concentration. preparation of protein-free supernatant was the same as for kynurenine measurement. tryptophan concentration was measured using a fluorescence detector at the excitation wavelength of 285 nm and emission
wavelength of 365 nm.

mixed leukocyte reaction
mlr was performed by addition of dc (1 ⫻ 104 cells/well) to allogeneic
or autologous t cells (1 ⫻ 105 cells/well) in rpmi 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fcs without addition of tryptophan in 96-well u-bottom
microtest tissue culture plates (bd biosciences). cultures were set up in
the presence or absence of ido inhibitor, 1-methyl- xxxd1794xxx  (1-mt,
150 ␮m; sigma-aldrich). for t cells stimulated by autologous dc, 1
␮g/ml purified anti-human cd3 ( xxxd2676xxx ) mab (ebioscience) was added to
the medium. triplicate wells were cultured for each group in mlr. cells
were stimulated ex vivo for 5 days, and l ␮ci/well [3h]thymidine was
added 18 h before the end of culture. the cells were then harvested onto

a group of 35 patients with definitive ra (based on the criteria of the
american rheumatism association) was investigated in this study, which
included 24 females and 11 males whose ages ranged from 24 to 73 years
(mean age, 43 years), with a disease duration of 9 ⫾ 6 years. erythrocyte

age-matched group of 36 healthy individuals was included as a control.
peripheral blood (pb) specimens were collected from ra patients or
healthy donors, and sf from ra patients during routine knee joint aspirations. samples of synovial tissue (st) were obtained from ra patients
during wrist synovectomy or arthroplasty. control st was obtained from
patients with traumatic lesions during knee arthroscopy. no immunosuppressive or immunomodulatory drugs had been taken by patients for at
least 3 mo when samples were collected. informed consent was obtained
from all study subjects before sample collection. the study protocol was
approved by the institutional review board of the institute of health sciences (shanghai, china).

upon scintillation counting. in parallel with each mlr, t cells alone were
cultured as controls for [3h]thymidine incorporation. in some experiments,
cellular apoptosis was determined using an  xxxg166xxx -fitc apoptosis detection kit i, according to the manufacturer’s instructions (bd biosciences). in brief, after 5-day mlr, cells were harvested, stained with
fitc-labeled  xxxg166xxx  and  xxxd3027xxx  iodide (pi) for 15 min at room
temperature, and analyzed by facs within 1 h. necrotic cells were excluded by gating on pi-negative (pi⫺) cells, and cell externalization of
phosphatidylserine was monitored by its binding to  xxxg166xxx .

tts induction
pbmc from healthy donors were cultured in complete medium with ifn-␥
(peprotech) (23), or with sf supernatant at the indicated dilutions, as
previously described (26), in 24-well plates at a concentration of 1 ⫻ 106
cells/ml/well. forty-eight hours after culture, cells were harvested and t
cells were sorted using facs for rna abstraction, tryptophan concentration detection, and mlr assay. tts expression in induced t cells was
measured by real-time pcr. in some experiments, additional neutralizing mouse anti-human mab were added to the sf-treated cultures to
counter il-18 (125-2h), il-10 (23738), ifn-␥ (25718), and/or tnf-␣
(6401) (5 ␮g/ml each; r&d systems), with mouse igg as control.

statistics
significant differences were evaluated with student’s t tests, except that
multiple treatment groups were compared within individual experiments by
anova or kruskal-wallis test. data are expressed as the mean ⫾ sd, and
probability values of ⬍0.05 were considered significant.

results
dc from joint sf of ra patients express functional ido
to determine the role of ido in autoreactive t cell persistence in ra
patients, we first measured the expression of ido in dc and cd3⫹ t
cells that were derived from ra patients, and compared it with that of
cells from healthy control donors. both rt-pcr and western blot
analysis showed that ido was detected only in dc derived from joint
sf (sf dc) and, to a lesser extent, pb (pb dc) of ra patients. in
contrast, ido was not detected in the control pb dc derived from
healthy donors, t cells that were derived from the pb (pb t cells) and
sf (sf t cells) of ra patients, or the control pb t cells of healthy
donors (fig. 1, a and b). immunohistochemical staining demonstrated
that macrophage-like cells in the joint st from ra patients expressed
ido (fig. 1c). culture of ra patient-derived sf dc in complete
medium containing tryptophan induced the production of significantly
higher levels of kynurenine (27.7 ⫾ 10.1 ␮m) than did dc from the
pb of ra patients (1.9 ⫾ 0.6 ␮m) and those from healthy donors
(2.2 ⫾ 0.6 ␮m; fig. 2). these data suggest that ido expressed by dc
of joint sf from ra patients is functionally active.
we next tested the ability of ra patient-derived ido-positive
sf dc and ido-negative pb dc to stimulate the proliferation of
allogeneic pb t cells of healthy donors, with healthy donorderived ido-negative pb dc as controls. both ido-negative pb

ra patient-derived sf t cells resist ido-mediated suppression
we next determined the ability of sf t cells derived from ra
patients to proliferate in response to ido-positive dc. ra patientderived sf t cells were cultured in the presence of allogeneic
ido-positive sf dc, with stimulation of pb t cells from ra
patients and pb t cells from healthy donors, respectively, with the
same allogeneic sf dc as controls. we found that all cultured t
cells proliferated in response to allogeneic ido-positive sf dc
(i.e., 29,136 ⫾ 3,600.2 cpm for sf t cells of ra patients;
33,990.2 ⫾ 5,411.7 cpm for pb t cells of ra patients; and
45,385.2 ⫾ 6,725.4 cpm for pb t cells of healthy donors; fig. 3b).
interestingly, addition of 1-mt to the cultures significantly enhanced the proliferation of pb t cells of healthy donors (75.3%)
and pb t cells of ra patients (71.6%), when compared with sf t
cells of ra patients (18.7%; fig. 3b). these results suggest that
the inhibitory effect of sf dc-derived ido on t cell proliferation
is markedly ablated in sf t cells from ra patients. this conclusion was further confirmed by the culture of ra patient-derived sf
t cells stimulated with autologous sf ido-positive dc together
with  xxxd2676xxx  mab, with or without addition of 1-mt. as shown
in fig. 3c, whereas both pb t cells of healthy donors and sf t
cells of ra patients proliferated to a similar extent in response to
ido-positive autologous dc plus  xxxd2676xxx  mab, addition of
1-mt significantly enhanced the proliferation of pb t cells from
healthy donors 4-fold more than that of sf t cells from ra patients. taken together, these data suggest that, although the expression of functional ido is increased in synovial dc and tissues
of ra patients, ra patient-derived sf t cells have developed the
ability to resist ido-mediated tryptophan deprivation.
enhanced expression of tts in synovial t cells from ra patients
previous studies have demonstrated that tts induces the association of tryptophan with its specific trna. this tryptophan-trna

measured by incorporation of [3h]thymidine added during the last 18 h of
the 5-day incubation. a, sf dc and pb dc derived from ra patients were
used as stimulators and were cultured with allogeneic pb t cells from

sf t cells from ra patients to ido-mediated deprivation of tryptophan, rna was prepared from sf t cells and pb t cells of ra

dc of ra patients and pb dc of healthy donors induced the
proliferation of allogeneic pb t cells from healthy donors. addition of ido inhibitor 1-mt did not affect the proliferation of allogeneic t cells in these ex vivo cultures (fig. 3a). in contrast,
whereas ra patient-derived sf dc that expressed high levels of
ido also stimulated allogeneic t cell proliferation, addition of
1-mt greatly enhanced the proliferation of these allogeneic t cells
(fig. 3a). these results suggest that sf dc of ra patients express
functional ido that is able to catabolize tryptophan, leading to the
inhibition of t cell proliferation.

patients, with pb t cells of healthy donors used as controls. realtime pcr showed that sf t cells of ra patients expressed significantly more tts transcripts than pb t cells from healthy donors or from ra patients (fig. 4a). furthermore, when t cells
were cultured in medium with additional tryptophan for 24 h, sf
t cells from ra patients consumed more tryptophan than did pb
t cells from ra patients or healthy donors (21.4 ⫾ 2.4 vs 50.1 ⫾
5.2 and 60.9 ⫾ 4.3 ␮m; fig. 4b). these results suggest that increased expression of tts in sf t cells from ra patients is tightly
correlated with their enhanced consumption of tryptophan.
previous studies have demonstrated that ifn-␥ is able to enhance the expression of tts in t cells (23). to determine whether
enhanced expression of tts augments the consumption of tryptophan by t cells, pbmc from healthy donors were treated with
ifn-␥ for 48 h, with untreated pbmc as controls. real-time pcr
showed significantly increased expression of tts in sorted t cells
from ifn-␥-treated pbmc as compared with untreated t cells ( p ⬍
0.05; fig. 5a). we referred to these ifn-␥-treated t cells expressing increased level of tts as ttshigh t cells, and those t cells left
ifn-␥ untreated as ttslow t cells. when cultured in medium with
additional tryptophan, there was significantly less tryptophan in the
supernatant from ttshigh t cell cultures than in that of ttslow t
cells (18.4 ⫾ 2.8 vs 61.0 ⫾ 1.4 ␮m; fig. 5b). addition of tts

of the isolated t cells was calculated through real-time pcr by comparing
with  xxxg861xxx  and was expressed as 2–⌬⌬ct. b, tryptophan concentration of
the culture supernatant of ifn-␥-induced t cells was determined by hplc.
ifn-␥-treated t cells expressing increased levels of tts were termed ttshigh
t cells, whereas those left ifn-␥ untreated were termed ttslow t cells. cells
were cultured for 24 h in complete medium with 50 ␮m added tryptophan. in
parallel, tryptamine, a tts inhibitor, was added to the ttshigh t cell cultures

cultures markedly enhanced the proliferation of ttslow, but not
ttshigh t cells (fig. 6a). supernatants from the culture of ttshigh
t cells stimulated with ido-positive dc contained a markedly
reduced amount of tryptophan catabolite kynurenine (5.7 ␮m) as
compared with that of ttslow t cells (14.9 ␮m). flow cytometric
analysis further revealed that more t cells underwent apoptosis in
the ttslow group stimulated by ido-positive dc than in the
ttshigh t cell group (44.1 vs 10.0%; fig. 6b). the findings indicated that enhanced expression of tts in t cells was responsible
for their resistance to ido-mediated tryptophan deprivation and
apoptotic cell death.
ra patient-derived sf enhances tts expression in t cells
finally, we tested whether factors in sf of ra patients play an
important role in up-regulating the expression of tts in sf t
cells. as shown in fig. 7a, stimulation of pbmc from ra patients
or healthy donors with ra patient-derived sf, but not with sera
from the same patient, increased the expression of tts in t cells
as many as 9-fold as compared with unstimulated t cells. this
sf-mediated up-regulation of tts expression was sf dose dependent (fig. 7b). addition of neutralizing mab to ifn-␥ or to
tnf-␣, but not to il-18 and il-10, blocked the elevation of tts
in healthy donor-derived t cells stimulated by ra patient-derived
sf (fig. 7c). thus, proinflammatory cytokines in the sf of ra
patients, including ifn-␥ and tnf-␣, play pivotal roles in upregulating tts in t cells.

discussion
catabolism of tryptophan by ido plays an important role in regulating t cell-mediated immune responses and inflammation (27,
28). we demonstrated that whereas dc freshly isolated from pb of
both healthy donors and ra patients did not express detectable
ido protein, sf dc from ra patients expressed high levels of
functionally active ido. although ido produced by sf dc inhibited the proliferation of pb t cells derived either from healthy

cells, but can be markedly up-regulated in cells such as t cells,
fibroblasts, and monocytes (21, 45– 48). interestingly, both ido
and tts can be induced by ifn-␥ (21, 22). it is conceivable that
cells expressing an increased level of tts are protected in an
environment in which increased ido leads to cell suppression.
indeed, there is recent evidence indicating that tts protects both
dc and cd8⫹ t cells against ido-mediated tryptophan deprivation and cytotoxic catabolites of tryptophan (23). similar protective effects on host cells expressing high levels of tts against
ido-mediated cell suppression have also been reported in host
cells infected by pathogens (49). in our study, we showed that
whereas synovial dc expressed high levels of active ido, synovial, but not peripheral t cells from ra patients had substantially
higher tts expression. it appears that the protective mechanism of
tts toward the suppressive effect of ido plays an important role
in survival of pathogenic t cells in inflamed rheumatoid synovium.
it is intriguing to investigate how tts is regulated in ra-sf t
cells. data from prior studies have demonstrated that ifn-␥ can
enhance the expression of tts in t cells (46, 50). we found that
ra patient-derived sf contained high levels of inflammatory cytokines ifn-␥ and tnf-␣ that are responsible for up-regulating
the expression of tts in t cells. although sf supernatant derived
from ra patients increased expression of tts in t cells from
healthy donors, addition of neutralizing mabs to ifn-␥ and/or
tnf-␣, but not mab to il-18 or il-10, markedly suppressed the
expression of tts in sf-treated t cells. furthermore, because
tts was up-regulated in normal t cells in response to ra patientderived sf, we suggest that the synovial environment of ra patients may be another major target for potential therapeutic intervention toward synovial inflammatory t cells in ra.
it is also of interest to understand that ifn-␥ has dual functions
in immune response. in rheumatoid synovium, although ifn-␥ increases ido in dc, it can also induce t cells to express high levels
of tts. previous studies have demonstrated that ifn-␥ is able to
increase the expression of tts in various types of cells as early as
6 h after exposure to ifn-␥ (21, 51). notably, treatment with
ifn-␥ for 18 h led to a 4-fold increase in the expression of tts in
human fibroblasts as opposed to that of control cells (45). these
findings collectively suggest that tts induction by ifn-␥ can be
mediated independently from de novo protein synthesis (21). our
results described in this study confirm that human t cells, upon
treatment with ifn-␥, substantially up-regulate the expression of
tts within 24 – 48 h, which is in agreement with previous reports
(21, 45). thus, although ifn-␥ can also increase ido in dc, the
superior ability of tts to ido in competing for tryptophan in ifn␥-activated t cells (18, 41– 43) results in an augmented intracellular
reservoir of tryptophan for protein synthesis and in decreased cytotoxic catabolites mediated by ido. further investigation of molecular
mechanisms by which ifn-␥ increases the expression of tts in inflammatory cells will be important for understanding the pathological
role of synovial inflammatory t cells in ra.
in summary, our data provide evidence for a link between impaired t cell response toward tryptophan depletion and environmental autoreactivity in ra patients. we demonstrated that
increased tts expression in t cells allows resistance to idomediated tryptophan deprivation, which may contribute to the persistence of autoreactive t cells in local tissues of patients with
autoimmune disease. given the importance of tryptophan metabolism in regulating t cell-mediated immune response, our findings
provide new insight into the pathophysiology of synovial inflammation in ra patients and development of novel therapeutic approaches for ra.

donors or ra patients, synovial t cells from ra patients resisted
the suppressive effect of ido. we found that these synovial t cells
from ra patients expressed high levels of tts and were able to
preserve tryptophan, which appears to be responsible for their resistance to ido-mediated tryptophan deprivation. furthermore,
blocking proinflammatory cytokines, including tnf-␣ and ifn-␥,
abrogated the effect of ra patient-derived sf on up-regulating
tts expression in t cells. compared with ttslow t cells, t cells
with increased expression of tts gained the ability to resist idomediated tryptophan deprivation. thus, it is likely that proinflammatory cytokines in sf of ra patients play important roles in
up-regulating tts expression in t cells, leading to the resistance
of t cells to tryptophan deprivation by ido and the subsequent
persistence of inflammatory synovial t cells in ra patients.
tryptophan is an essential amino acid that is required by all cells
to synthesize proteins. the depletion of tryptophan and the accumulation of proapoptotic tryptophan-derived catabolite may arrest
proliferating cells in mid-g1 phase and block effector activity of t
cells (29). data from previous studies indicate that ido⫹ dc is
involved in the development of tolerance (30 –35). ido⫹ dc suppressed ag-specific t cell responses in vitro (36). induction of
ido in dc by ctla-4-ig resulted in blockade of clonal t cell
expansion (37). furthermore, in vivo administration of 1-mt to
mice, the specific inhibitor of ido, accelerated the diseases of
experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (38) and t cellmediated colitis (39), in which autoreactive t cells persist during
disease progression. autoreactive t cells capable of recognizing
tissue-specific ags are not necessarily deleted in the thymus as
they can be cloned from lymph nodes of mice and from the circulation of humans (40). however, the manner in which these
self-reactive t cells are exquisitely regulated remains controversial. data from recent studies indicate that regulatory dc expressing high levels of ido play important roles in modulating autoimmune responses (27). in our studies, we found that although sf
dc from patients with ra expressed functional ido, synovial t
cells isolated from these patients resisted ido-mediated suppression. these observations suggest that the resistance of synovial t
cells to ido-mediated tryptophan deprivation is an important
mechanism responsible for the persistence of inflammatory t cells
in the joints of ra patients.
the resistance of synovial t cells to ido-mediated deprivation
of tryptophan is associated with the increased expression of tts.
data from other investigators suggest that tts protects t cells
from ido-mediated cell injury by inducing the formation of tryptophan-trna complex. this outcome benefits from the lower
michaelis constant (km) of tts for tryptophan than that of ido
(18, 41– 43). this may result not only in significantly increased
preservation of intracellular tryptophan-trna complex for protein
synthesis, but also in the reduction of cytotoxic tryptophan catabolites mediated by ido. indeed, our findings indicate that stimulation of ttshigh t cells with ido-positive dc leads to more markedly decreased tryptophan catabolites kynurenines (5.7 ␮m) than
does stimulation of ttslow t cells (14.9 ␮m). such stimulation
was accompanied by substantially reduced apoptosis in ttshigh t
cells as compared with that of ttslow t cells. this supports the
observations from previous studies that the tryptophan catabolites
are cytotoxic to t cells (44). it is likely that by use of tryptophan,
tts has dual protective effects on t cells toward ido-mediated
cell suppression, which increases survival of inflammatory t cells
in inflamed rheumatoid synovium.
the exact causal relationship between ido and tts is not entirely known. previous studies have demonstrated that whereas
ido is mainly expressed in macrophages, dc, and placental trophoblasts (22), tts is constitutively expressed in various types of
