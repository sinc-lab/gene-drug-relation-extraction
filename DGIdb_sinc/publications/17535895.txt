bisphosphonate drugs (e.g., fosamax and zometa) are thought to
act primarily by inhibiting  xxxd2086xxx  synthase ( xxxg778xxx ),
resulting in decreased prenylation of small gtpases. here, we show
that some bisphosphonates can also inhibit  xxxg888xxx  ( xxxg888xxx ), as well as undecaprenyl diphosphate
synthase (upps), a cis-prenyltransferase of interest as a target for
antibacterial therapy. our results on  xxxg888xxx  (10 structures) show
that there are three bisphosphonate-binding sites, consisting of
fpp or  xxxd2397xxx  substrate-binding sites together
with a  xxxd578xxx  product- or inhibitor-binding site. in upps, there are
a total of four binding sites (in five structures). these results are of
general interest because they provide the first structures of ggppsand upps-inhibitor complexes, potentially important drug targets,
in addition to revealing a remarkably broad spectrum of binding
modes not seen in  xxxg778xxx  inhibition.

soprenoid biosynthesis involves the condensation of c5diphosphates to form a very broad range of compounds used
in cell membrane (cholesterol, ergosterol), cell wall (lipid i, ii,
peptidoglycan) and terpene biosynthesis, electron transfer (quinone, heme a, carotenoid, chlorophyll), and in many eukaryotes,
cell signaling pathways (ras, rho, rap, rac). there has, therefore, been considerable interest in developing specific inhibitors
of some of these pathways to modify cell function. for example,
the bisphosphonate drugs used to treat bone resorption diseases
such as osteoporosis (1) have been thought to function by
targeting  xxxd2086xxx  synthase ( xxxg778xxx ,  xxxg1735xxx .10) in
osteoclasts, leading to dysregulation of cell-signaling pathways
involving small gtpases, and in some parasitic protozoa, leading
to inhibition of ergosterol biosynthesis (2). however, in recent
work goffinet et al. (3) proposed that the main biological activity
of the most potent bisphosphonate  xxxd3561xxx  (zometa) in
humans cells is directed against protein geranylgeranylation.
this opens up the intriguing possibility that it might be possible
to enhance potency by developing drugs that work by inhibiting
 xxxg888xxx  ( xxxg888xxx ,  xxxg1735xxx .30), the
enzyme that produces the  xxxd578xxx  ( xxxd578xxx )
used to geranylgeranylate e.g., rac, rap, and rho. based on the
recent observation of a previously uncharacterized ( xxxd578xxx )
inhibitor site in  xxxg888xxx  (4), we reasoned that larger, more
hydrophobic species than those in current use might bind to this
site and exhibit enhanced activity, because of increased hydrophobic stabilization and, in cells, enhanced lipophilicity. here,
we thus report structures of a series of five bisphosphonates
bound to  xxxg888xxx  together with, for comparative purposes, the
structures of five isoprenoid diphosphate– xxxg888xxx  complexes.
we find three quite different binding modes, corresponding to
fpp/gpp (substrate), ipp (substrate), and  xxxd578xxx  [product/
inhibitor (4)] site occupancy.

the  xxxg778xxx  and  xxxg888xxx  enzymes noted above belong to a class
of enzymes called trans-prenyltransferases that are involved in
trans double-bond addition (fig. 1a) of  xxxd2397xxx 
(ipp) to  xxxd1897xxx  ( xxxd1897xxx ) to form all-transisoprenoid diphosphates, such as fpp and  xxxd578xxx . in addition to
these trans-prenyltransferases, there is also a second class of
enzymes called cis-prenyltransferases. these enzymes typically
use an fpp (all-trans) substrate that is then elongated via cis
double-bond addition (fig. 1a), to form mixed (e,z) long-chain
isoprenoids, such as undecaprenyl diphosphate (upps, ec
2.5.1.31), a c55-diphosphate of considerable interest (5, 6) as a
new target for anti-microbial therapy because undecaprenyl
diphosphate (upp) is used to form the lipid-i and lipid-ii species
needed for peptidoglycan cell-wall biosynthesis in bacteria. we
also describe herein, therefore, the x-ray structures of five upps
inhibitors bound to upps, the most active having an ic50 of
⬍600 nm. the upps structures obtained are unusual in that we
find four distinct binding sites, one of which (seen in all
structures) corresponds to the fpp-binding site seen previously
(7). in addition to these crystallographic results, we also report
the activities and quantitative structure-activity relationships for
a larger series of bisphosphonates in upps inhibition, with
activities being predicted within a factor of ⬇2 over an ⬇103⫻
range in activity, which, combined with the crystallographic
results, should facilitate the further development of these compounds.

diphosphate ( xxxd578xxx ), fig. 1b, together with thiolo-fpp ( xxxd2092xxx ),
bound to  xxxg888xxx  from saccharomyces cerevisiae, to deduce the
principal binding sites for these species. data collection and
refinement statistics for five such  xxxg888xxx -diphosphate complexes are presented in supporting information (si) table 1, with
the actual structures (fig. 1 c–i, pdb id codes 2e8u, 2e8x,
2e90, 2e8t, and 2e8v) providing a useful background with
which to interpret the bisphosphonate-bound structures discussed below. the yeast enzyme has considerable homology to
human  xxxg888xxx  (43% identity, 60% similarity) and we also find
that there is a good (r ⫽ 0.9, p ⫽ 0.0035) correlation between
the ki values for bisphosphonate inhibition of the yeast and
human proteins (si table 2). so the overall results obtained here
are likely to be of interest for the development of novel  xxxg888xxx 
inhibitors for a variety of eukaryotic species.
 xxxg888xxx  crystallizes as a dimer (8) in one of two space groups
(orthorhombic or monoclinic), and each monomer is composed
almost entirely of ␣-helices. fig. 1c shows a diagram of one
representative new structure ( xxxg888xxx -mg– xxxd2092xxx -ipp) in which
both ipp and  xxxd2092xxx  bind to  xxxg888xxx  and key protein–ligand
interactions are illustrated in fig. 1d. this structure closely
resembles that seen with diphosphates and bisphosphonates
bound to  xxxg778xxx  (9–13). however, when the structures of more
diphosphates bound to  xxxg888xxx  are investigated, we find evidence for other binding sites. for example, with ipp, fig. 1e, we
find that ipp binds to both the ‘‘normal,’’ homoallylic ipp site
occupied by ipp in  xxxg778xxx , and the allylic (gpp or fpp) binding
site. the presence of two binding sites (one weak and one strong)
has also been proposed for ipp binding to  xxxg778xxx  (9), based on
isothermal titration calorimetry, and, given the results shown in
fig. 1e (pdb id code 2e8u), it seems likely that  xxxg778xxx -(ipp)2
has a similar structure, with ipp in one site chelating to mg2⫹,
as shown in fig. 1e.
as the length of the isoprene side chain is increased, we see
(fig. 1 f–h) that the longer (gpp, c10; fpp, c15;  xxxd2092xxx , c15) side
chains occupy the fpp substrate-binding site, but with  xxxd578xxx 
(c20), this site is no longer occupied because there are three
residues: leu-67, tyr-107, and his-139, which prevent chain
elongation (i.e., there are no  xxxd1102xxx  products with  xxxg888xxx ). in
guo et al.

human  xxxg888xxx , it is known that  xxxd578xxx  is a  xxxg888xxx  inhibitor and
could be involved with negative feedback, and kavanagh et al. (4)
recently identified a so-called ‘‘inhibitor site,’’ occupied by
 xxxd578xxx . with the yeast enzyme, we find that the  xxxd578xxx  diphosphate group binds to the ipp site, whereas the c20 side chain
binds to the fpp side chain site, as shown in fig. 1i, similar to
the orientation seen in  xxxg888xxx  from sinapis alba (14), but there
is no mg2⫹ present. as expected, neither ipp (fig. 1h) nor ppi
(fig. 1g) can bind here because the ipp-diphosphate site is
occupied. so, the yeast  xxxd578xxx  product binds with its diphosphate
in the ipp diphosphate site (ipp), whereas the  xxxd578xxx  side chain
binds to the fpp site. however, in human  xxxg888xxx , the  xxxd578xxx 
product binds with its diphosphate in the fpp site, whereas the
 xxxd578xxx  side chain binds to the novel (human) ‘‘inhibitor site’’
( xxxd578xxx ). these results show a remarkably broad range of binding
motifs for diphosphates in  xxxg888xxx . with the small ipp ligand,
both the allylic and the homoallylic sites can be occupied,
because the ligand side chains are small. this is not seen with
gpp, because the presence of a c10 side chain in both sites would
likely produce a steric clash, but smaller ligands (ppi or ipp) can
bind in the presence of large (fpp,  xxxd2092xxx ) side chains (fig. 1 g
and h). with the very large  xxxd578xxx  species, both the ipp and fpp
sites are occupied, fig. 1i, but by just one molecule, spanning
both sites. based on the similarity between the diphosphate
substrates (and product) and bisphosphonate inhibitors (15),
there appear therefore to be at least four likely binding modes
for bisphosphonates in  xxxg888xxx : fpp-fpp, fpp- xxxd578xxx , ippfpp, and ipp- xxxd578xxx . that is, diphosphate moieties can bind in
either the ipp or fpp sites, whereas the side chains can bind in
either the fpp (substrate),  xxxd578xxx  (inhibitor), or, if small, the ipp
site.
we next consider, therefore, the actual binding modes seen
with bisphosphonate inhibitors and begin by investigating the
small, ‘‘third generation’’ species  xxxd3561xxx  and minodronate
(fig. 2a), potent  xxxg778xxx  inhibitors that also inhibit  xxxg888xxx  (si
table 2). data collection and refinement statistics for all five
 xxxg888xxx –bisphosphonate complexes are given in si table 3. the
overall structures of each of the inhibitor-bound  xxxg888xxx  complexes closely resemble that seen in the apo-enzyme at 1.98-å

(si fig. 7a) and minodronate, fig. 2c, it can be seen that these
bisphosphonates form  xxxg888xxx  complexes containing 2 mg2⫹

that are coordinated to conserved aspartate residues, with the
bisphosphonate backbones also interacting with the side chains
of arg-84, lys-169, asp-209, and lys-223 via hydrogen bonds.
the distal n-atoms in the rings are also hydrogen bonded to the
side-chain oxygen of thr-170 and the main-chain carbonyl
oxygen of lys-169 (fig. 2c and si fig. 7a). this binding pattern
is remarkably similar to that seen with  xxxd3561xxx  and minodronate (and, indeed, many other bisphosphonates) binding to a
variety of  xxxg778xxx  enzymes (9–13) and strongly suggests, at least for
these compounds, that they could act as carbocation transition
state/reactive intermediate analogs (15). this similarity is seen
more graphically in fig. 2d in which we superimpose the
structure of  xxxd3561xxx  bound to human  xxxg778xxx  onto that of
 xxxg888xxx – xxxd3561xxx . for example, n3 in the imidazole ring of
 xxxd3561xxx  is within hydrogen-bond distance of thr-170 in
 xxxg888xxx  as well as the corresponding thr-201 in human  xxxg778xxx .
one difference, however, is that in  xxxg888xxx  we (again) find
evidence for only two and not three mg2⫹, the same situation as
found with  xxxd578xxx  binding to human  xxxg888xxx  (4) as well as in
most of the diphosphate complexes shown in fig. 1. this may be
related to buffer ph effects, resulting in a protonated asp-209.
the third-generation bisphosphonates  xxxd3561xxx  and minodronate thus bind to  xxxg888xxx  in a basically similar way as they do
to human, escherichia coli, trypanosoma brucei, and trypanosoma cruzi  xxxg778xxx . however, as can be seen in si table 2, these
compounds are not the most active ones in  xxxg888xxx  inhibition,
although they are the most potent  xxxg778xxx  inhibitors.
we next consider the binding of three more potent  xxxg888xxx 
inhibitors: bph-364,  xxxd1320xxx , and bph-675 (fig. 2 a, bph,
bisphosphonate), compounds that appear to be more potent
 xxxg888xxx  inhibitors because of the addition of a large, hydrophobic moiety. we show in fig. 3 and si fig. 7b the structures of
each of these inhibitors bound to  xxxg888xxx . with bph-364 and
bph-675, the bisphosphonate backbones bind via 1 or 2 mg2⫹ to
the protein into the same sites as seen with  xxxd578xxx  bound to
human  xxxg888xxx : fpp- xxxd578xxx . the ligand interactions seen with
bph-675 are shown in fig. 3a and si fig. 8 and clearly place it
in the fpp- xxxd578xxx  site, shown more graphically in fig. 4a
superimposed on bph-364 and  xxxd578xxx  (human structure, blue
shading). these results are of interest because they clearly show
that large, hydrophobic inhibitors bind to the  xxxd578xxx  site seen in
the human enzyme, where they can chelate to mg2⫹, absent in
the ipp site. in the case of  xxxd1320xxx  (figs. 2 a and 3 b and c),
a neutral side chain (dibenzofuran) containing bisphosphonate,
the results are surprising in that, as can be seen from the electron
density shown in fig. 3b, there are two (as opposed to one)
bisphosphonate binding sites, and there is no mg2⫹ observable.
in the first structure ( xxxd1320xxx -1, fig. 3c), the bisphosphonate
backbone forms h bonds with arg-84, lys-169, gln-206, asp209, and lys-223, with the o atom on the dibenzofuran ring
forming an h bond with the side chain of ser-71. this represents
the fpp-fpp-binding site location seen with  xxxd3561xxx , minodronate, and  xxxd2092xxx  and is shown in orange in fig. 4b. the other
conformer ( xxxd1320xxx -2) binds with its bisphosphonate in the ipp
site, with one phosphonate group binding to arg-85 and his-68,
the same residues that are responsible for binding to the
diphosphate of ipp. as expected, there is no mg2⫹ present in this
ipp site. however, in this instance, the bulky aromatic moiety
extends into the (human)  xxxd578xxx  site, so binding is ipp- xxxd578xxx ,
using the nomenclature suggested above, and this site is shown
in pink in fig. 4c.
the first binding site (fig. 4a), occupied by bph-364 and
bph-675, thus corresponds to the fpp- xxxd578xxx  site identified as
the  xxxd578xxx  ‘‘inhibitor’’ site in the human  xxxg888xxx - xxxd578xxx  structure by kavanagh et al. (4). the pocket is 19.3 å long and can
readily accommodate long bisphosphonates, such as bph-675,
that have about the same length as  xxxd578xxx  itself (16.2 å,
bph-675; 17.1 å,  xxxd578xxx ). clearly, longer bisphosphonates will

experience enhanced van der waals dispersion interactions in
this site and an enhanced hydrophobic effect, resulting in
enhanced potency as  xxxg888xxx  inhibitors, plus, in some cases, we
find evidence for mg2⫹ binding as well, which can also enhance
potency, because of bidentate chelation. however, much longer
analogs may have diminished activity, because they are likely to
clash sterically with leu-42 and thr-177 at the distal end of the
 xxxd578xxx -binding pocket. in this binding mode, the presence of a
carbocation positive-charge feature would be unlikely to be a
factor in potency, because the  xxxd578xxx  inhibitor site has no
obvious requirement for carbocation character, and, indeed,
earlier quantitative structure activity relationship (qsar) investigations revealed no requirement for a positive charge
feature in  xxxg888xxx  inhibition (16), unlike the situation found with
 xxxg778xxx  inhibition (17).
we show in fig. 4b (in orange) the  xxxd2092xxx ,  xxxd3561xxx ,
minodronate, and  xxxd1320xxx -1 conformers located in the fppfpp-binding site, that is, the one analogous to that seen in  xxxg778xxx .
this site is ⬇13 å long (about the same length as the substrate,
fpp, 12 å) and the bisphosphonates  xxxd3561xxx  and minodronate bind here to the protein via two mg2⫹. however, the
smaller bisphosphonates are less potent inhibitors of both
the saccharomyces cerevisiae and human enzymes (si table 2).
guo et al.

the bisphosphonate  xxxd1320xxx  also binds to this site in one
conformation, however, no mg2⫹ is found. as noted above, the
second conformer of  xxxd1320xxx  binds ipp- xxxd578xxx  (pink in fig.
4c), and again reflects the smaller size (⬇13 å) of the pocket
and the inhibitor. in the yeast enzyme,  xxxd578xxx  binds ipp-fpp
(shown in green, fig. 4d), but no bisphosphonates examined so
far bind in this manner.
we also find, as shown in fig. 4e, that the backbone and
side-chain conformations of  xxxd1320xxx -1 and -2 are very similar,
with only a 1.47-å rms deviation for the heavy atoms, and
bph-364 adopts a similar conformation (si fig. 7b). also of
interest is the observation that the  xxxd578xxx  structures seen in the
human and s. cerevisiae enzymes are very similar (a 2.3-å rmsd),
plus, the ‘‘curved’’ conformation of the longest inhibitor (bph675) is clearly quite similar to that seen with the  xxxd578xxx  inhibitors, as illustrated in fig. 4f. it is, of course, intriguing to
speculate that even more potent compounds can be designed
that occupy both hydrophobic sites [perhaps, for example,
species such as the recently reported bis-prenyl bisphosphonates
(18)], enhancing potency and specificity, although it is also
possible that optimum cellular activity may be obtained with
compounds that can inhibit both  xxxg778xxx  and  xxxg888xxx .

ic50 and pic50 values are shown in si table 4. based on these
results, we selected the three compounds shown in fig. 5a for
crystallographic investigation, in addition to  xxxd1320xxx  and bph675 (fig. 2 a). data collection and refinement statistics for all
upps complexes are given in si table 5 (pdb id codes 2e98,

the upps–bisphosphonate complex structures each contain
a central ␤-sheet with six parallel strands and seven surrounding
␣-helices in each monomer of the dimeric protein, and two views
of the structure of one dimeric complex ( xxxd1320xxx ) are shown in
fig. 5 b and c (the four other structures are shown in si figs.
10–13). in each of the five structures, we found that there were
up to four binding sites per monomer, labeled 1–4 in fig. 5c.
three of the binding sites occupy the top of a ‘‘funnel’’ region,
whereas the fourth site is situated at the bottom of the funnel,
as shown in fig. 5c. when all bisphosphonate complex structures are superimposed on the upps-mg– xxxd2092xxx -ipp structure
(si fig. 14), the width (10.3–12.9 å) and length (21–25.2 å) of
the funnel-shaped hydrophobic tunnel are well defined, and it is
clear that site 1 corresponds to the fpp ( xxxd2092xxx ) substrate-binding
site (shown in yellow in si fig. 14). ligand interactions with
asp-26, asn-28, arg-39, his-43, arg-51, arg-77, phe-89, arg102, and his-103 are common to all five structures (all four sites),
and detailed interactions for site 1 are shown in terms of a

unexpected in a c55 prenyl synthase, and with the bisphosphonates investigated here, enables up to four inhibitors to bind to
a central cavity, illustrated by the surface representation for
 xxxd1320xxx  (all four sites) in fig. 6b and for all bisphosphonates
in fig. 6c; stereo views are shown in si fig. 19.
so, in  xxxg778xxx , there is just a single inhibitor site, in  xxxg888xxx  there
are at least three, and in upps, there are four. this raises the
question: is it possible to predict the activity of a given bisphosphonate by using qsar methods? this might be expected to be
rather difficult, given the multiple site binding seen crystallographically in  xxxg888xxx  and upps. however, in previous work, we
found that  xxxg888xxx  inhibition by diphosphates and bisphosphonates could, in fact, be quite well predicted, perhaps because
most of the potent compounds that dominated the qsar were
 xxxd578xxx -like (16). this ability to predict  xxxg888xxx  activity suggests

that it might also be possible to predict upps inhibition,
especially if the inhibitors bind more tightly to one particular site,
and, upon detailed inspection of the upps structures, we find

that, on average, there are only ⬇9 protein contacts for sites 2–4,
to be compared with ⬇14 for site 1, and 15 for  xxxd2092xxx , strongly
suggesting that inhibition at the fpp site, site 1, might well
dominate any sar. the results of 2d and hologram qsar
(hqsar) in addition to a pharmacophore model (see si
methods for details) are shown in fig. 6 d and e, si tables 6–10,
and si fig. 20 and clearly show that excellent predictions of the
experimental pic50 values can be made. for example, r2 ⫽ 0.85,
q2 ⫽ 0.76, f test: 157.3, p ⬍ 0.0001, n ⫽ 29 for the 2d qsar
method, fig. 6d, with a prediction error of ⬇2 over a ⬇103⫻
range in activity. the hqsar and pharmacophore modeling
results gave similarly good accord, and a representative topscoring upps pharmacophore is shown in fig. 6e compared
with previous results for  xxxg778xxx  and  xxxg888xxx  inhibition (16). in the
upps pharmacophore, there are two negative ionizable groups
(blue) and three hydrophobic features (cyan) shown superimposed on the structure of  xxxd1320xxx , the most potent upps
inhibitor, fig. 6e. the pharmacophore for  xxxg888xxx  inhibition is
similar, but neither pharmacophore gives evidence of the importance of the cationic feature present in the  xxxg778xxx  result, fig.
6e. in fact, the upps 2d-qsar descriptors involving positive
charge actually indicate a slight reduction in activity with positive
charge (si table 6). although perhaps at first surprising, it now
seems clear that  xxxg778xxx  inhibition requires a positive-charge
feature, as deduced by qsar (17) and observed by nmr (13),
but  xxxg888xxx  inhibition with the compounds investigated so far
does not because, especially for the larger inhibitors, the combination of a large hydrophobic feature together with, in some
cases, mg2⫹ binding, provides good potency. that is, because the
more potent  xxxg888xxx  inhibitors are not transition state/reactive
intermediate analogs, there is no charge required.
finally, we should note that the observation of the lack of
importance of a positive-charge feature in  xxxg888xxx  inhibitors
might be the exception and not the rule for trans-prenyltransferase inhibitors. for example, geranyl (c10) diphosphate synthase and  xxxg778xxx  are potently inhibited by bisphosphonates (9–13,
19). moreover, other long-chain prenyltransferases are also
potently inhibited by bisphosphonates, such as  xxxd3561xxx , and
we show in si table 11 a compilation of ic50 values for  xxxg888xxx ,
hexaprenyl diphosphate synthase (hpps, from sulfolobus solfataricus) and octaprenyl diphosphate synthase (opps, from e.
coli) for each of the inhibitors investigated here. the results
obtained clearly show that some bisphosphonates can have
potent activity against other, long-chain trans-prenyltrans-

ferases, in particular those used in quinone biosynthesis, opening
up further possibilities for inhibitor or drug design.
overall then, the results we have obtained above are of general
interest because they show that bisphosphonates can be potent
inhibitors of both cis- and trans-prenyltransferases. in  xxxg888xxx ,
there are potentially four binding modes based on two polar (the
fpp and ipp diphosphate) and two hydrophobic (farnesyl,
geranylgeranyl side-chain) binding sites, with bisphosphonates
binding to three of these sites. in upps, four binding sites are
seen crystallographically, but only the fpp-site (site 1) is occupied in all structures, and, because it has the largest number of
protein-ligand contacts, we propose that occupancy of this site
dominates enzyme inhibition. indeed, the results of a variety of
qsar methods give excellent predictions of upps inhibition
with a factor of ⬇2 error in activity prediction over a ⬇103⫻
range in activity. the observation of multiple binding sites in
 xxxg888xxx  and upps is in sharp contrast to the observation of only
one bisphosphonate-binding site in  xxxg778xxx , and the availability of
these structures opens up new avenues for the design of novel
inhibitors (drugs) that target these important enzymes, including
the possibility of using them in a ‘‘fragment-based’’ approach to
the development of more potent and specific species.
