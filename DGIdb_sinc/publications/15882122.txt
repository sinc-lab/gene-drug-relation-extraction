8. expert opinion

 xxxd134xxx  is a synthetic peripherally restricted µ-receptor opioid antagonist.
 xxxd134xxx  has a greater affinity for the µ-receptor than the kappa- or sigma-opioid
receptors (ki = 0.77 nm). the polarity of the molecule limits gastrointestinal
absorption and central nervous system penetration. it has limited systemic
bioavailability and higher affinity for the µ-opioid receptor than naloxone
(ki = 3.7 nm). completed phase iii trials suggest efficacy in accelerating the
recovery of gastrointestinal function after abdominal surgery. adverse events
with all doses have been similar to placebo groups. further efficacy in alleviating opioid-induced bowel dysfunction in patients with chronic opioid
usage has also been demonstrated. this evidence-based review assesses this
new drug and discusses its potential role in clinical practice.

1. introduction

opioid-based analgesia is not the effective panacea of anodynes in controlling postoperative pain that it was once hoped to be. the primary side effects of these medications include sedation and gastrointestinal dysmotility. the most troublesome
gastrointestinal symptoms associated with opioid usage include nausea, vomiting,
constipation and associated colic-like abdominal pain [1]. these symptoms fall
under the largely under-recognised condition labelled as opioid-induced bowel dysfunction (obd) [2]. both the acute and chronic usage of opioids may cause obd.
in patients on chronic opioid medication, constipation might become a difficult
clinical problem. furthermore, in patients who have undergone surgery, the duration of the postoperative ileus might be compounded by the necessary use of opioids
for effective analgesia.
with increasing understanding of the neurokinetics underlying the enteric nervous system, the discovery of the presence of enteric opioid receptors and the clinical
application of opioid agonists for the treatment of diarrhoea, attention turned to the
possibility of utilising selective opioid antagonists in an attempt to minimise, or
even reverse, the deleterious gastrointestinal side effects associated with opioid usage.
opioid receptors are present in the central, peripheral and enteric nervous systems.
the clinical use of morphine as an analgesic targets both the central and peripheral
µ-receptors. most gastrointestinal dysmotility associated with the use of morphine
appears to be related to its peripheral action. initial attempts at targeting opioidrelated dysmotility involved the use of the pan-opioid receptor antagonist naloxone
and met with some success in alleviating obd. the efficacy of naloxone for obd
was compromised due to its limited systemic bioavailability secondary to an extensive
first-pass metabolism, and the reversal of centrally mediated analgesia [3].
n- xxxd2614xxx  is a more selective peripheral quaternary opioid receptor
antagonist, with preferential µ-receptor affinity. it represented a significant development in the search for an effective peripheral opioid antagonist that did not impair
the central receptors necessary for analgesia [4]. n- xxxd2614xxx  was the first relatively selective peripheral opioid antagonist developed for clinical usage [5]. it is the
quaternary derivative of the opioid antagonist naltrexone. the bioavailability of

n- xxxd2614xxx  is < 1% and it does not cross the blood–
brain barrier. n- xxxd2614xxx  has been shown in several
clinical trials to reduce the delay in transit time associated with
chronic opioid use in a dose-dependent fashion [6].
in recent years, research has focused on newer opioid
receptor antagonists in the form of adl8-2698 ( xxxd134xxx )
[7], which is highly selective for the µ-receptor and has been
shown to be safe and effective in clinical trials. the possibility of using  xxxd134xxx  to reduce postoperative ileus is an
area of rapidly developing interest. this review provides an
overview of  xxxd134xxx : a novel selective peripherally acting
opioid-receptor antagonist.
2. gastrointestinal

motility

 xxxd134xxx  acts on the pathways that influence gastrointestinal motility in the postoperative period. the regulation
of these pathways includes the inherent activity of the enteric
nervous system, which is reflected in the electrophysiological
activity of the smooth muscle cells by both slow waves and
propulsive spikes. the pacemaker potentials are a complex
mixture of hormonal interactions, input from the autonomic
nervous system and a series of neuronal reflexes that might
induce the activation or inhibition of gut motility [8].
the enteric nervous system is enclosed within the bowel
layers itself and is composed of a myenteric plexus located
between the longitudinal and circular layers of smooth muscle
and a submucosal plexus. the latter is concerned with local
control of secretions and absorption. the myenteric plexus
occupies the length of the intestine and is involved in conduction velocity, contraction rhythm and mural tone [9]. the
large array of neurotransmitters implicated in the activity of
the nervous system includes acetylcholine, noradrenaline,
dopamine, 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-ht), vasoactive intestinal
peptide,  xxxg2240xxx ,  xxxg1722xxx  and  xxxg1801xxx .
knowledge of the impact of these neurotransmitters on gastrointestinal function has allowed several clinically useful
agents that augment gastrointestinal motility to be developed
such as  xxxd1927xxx  and  xxxd1708xxx .
the autonomic nervous system is also intricately
involved in the control of gastrointestinal motility; parasympathetic input is mediated through the vagus and pelvic nerves. the vagus nerve extends from the oesophagus
to the proximal colon, while the sacral parasympathetic
nerves (s2, -3 and -4) influence the remaining colon. the
neurons are located in the myenteric and submucosal
plexus, and activation induces increased gastrointestinal
motility. the sympathetic nerve fibres between t5 and l2
through the splanchnic nerves also synapse with neurons of
the myenteric plexus and are inhibitory in nature [10].
gastrointestinal hormones such as gastrin, cholecystokinin, motilin, somatostatin, glucagons and gastric inhibitory peptide also influence motility. this multitude makes
it difficult to define the exact significance of each agent in
the overall control.
480

endogenous opioids, such as  xxxg1801xxx ,  xxxg1722xxx , endomorphin, dynorphin and  xxxg1801xxx , are also
present in the neurons of the enteric nervous system. these
endogenous opioids have been detected in the neurons of the
myenteric plexus, submucosal plexus and the endocrine cells
of the intestinal mucosa [11]. the activity of these endogenous
opioids is dependent on the specificity and affinity for the various membrane-bound opioid receptors described. they have
been shown to activate receptors in the central nervous, gastrointestinal, musculoskeletal and vascular systems and sensory peripheral neurons [12]. opioid analgesics are not as
specific for the endogenous opioid receptors as their naturally
occurring counterparts. however, a better understanding of
the differential distribution and functionality of the various
opioid receptors has provided a sound rationale for targeting
these receptors in clinical practice. by using selective opioid
receptor agonists and, more recently, selective opioid antagonists in the control of gastrointestinal and analgesic pathways,
significant improvement in the maintenance of gut motility
has been achieved without compromising analgesia.
3. opioid

receptors

there are three main types of opioid receptors recognised, the
kappa-, sigma- and µ-opioid receptors, respectively [13]. however, there
are further receptors in this family, but only limited work has
been performed on their functionality. these include the
epsilon-receptor and op4 receptor [14,15]. the classic three opioid
receptors (kappa-, sigma- and µ-) bind endogenous ligands that
include endorphins, enkephalins, dynorphins and therapeutic
exogenous ligands such as morphine and its derivatives. the
kappa-opioid receptor has been shown to induce analgesia, bowel
dysfunction, diuresis and sedation. most of these effects have
been demonstrated using the opioid dynorphin a(1-13).
there are also a number of kappa-opioid receptor subtypes, but
their function is poorly understood [16]. the kappa-opioid receptors are located in the intestinal wall, primarily in the myenteric plexus and have been shown to be present on both the
nerve terminals and on the somatodendritic synaptic terminal
elements. they have been shown to be present in the cns
and are involved in analgesia with the enkephalins as their
endogenous ligand.
of the described subtypes, the µ-opioid receptors are primarily implicated in regulating analgesia and gastrointestinal
motility. the µ-opioid receptor may be further classified into
the subtypes -µ1 and -µ2. the endogenous opioids, endomorphin-1 and -2 have the highest affinity for the µ-opioid receptor; however, it is  xxxg1801xxx  that has the most efficacy in
terms of action. the µ1-receptors are located in the brain and
their activation is responsible for analgesia. these receptors
are the target of morphine and most clinically used opioidbased analgesic agonists. the µ2-receptor is present in the spinal cord and gastrointestinal tract. the µ-receptors are particularly dense in the bowel wall with the µ-receptor identified
in the submucosal and mucosal layers in rat models. they are

also present in the muscle layer, being identified on nerve terminals. activation of these receptors is responsible for respiratory depression and obd [17]. the µ1- and µ2-receptors are a
product of the  xxxg1635xxx  gene. the difference is established
based on two splice variants of the presence or absence of
eight c-terminal amino acids. in animal models, morphine
decreases acetylcholine release through the activation of the
µ-receptors. this decrease in neurotransmitter release (acetylcholine) results in a reduction in gut motility. in patients
receiving morphine, myoelectrical colonic activity is disrupted
following surgery [18]. with progressive opioid dose escalation, the gastrointestinal side effects increase, including
decreased colonic propulsion, increased sphincter tone, gastrostasis and increased fluid absorption [19]. as the current
opioid based analgesics remain nonselective for the various
opioid receptor subtypes, the manifestations of obd often
parallels the efficacy of analgesia achieved in clinical practice.
the ideal paradigm is, therefore, to maximise the efficacy
of opioid-induced analgesia without having adverse gastrointestinal side effects. this paradigm is complicated because
morphine-induced gastrointestinal delay has been shown to
be mediated by its central agonist and peripheral agonist
opioid receptor effect.
4. peripheral

opioid antagonists

two approaches were used to develop an effective therapeutic
strategy to ameliorate the gastrointestinal side effects of opioids without compromising analgesia. the first attempted to
limit the systemic absorption of effective opioid antagonists
and the second the use of selective peripheral opioid receptor
specific antagonists while limiting its ability to cross the
blood–brain barrier.
naloxone (a specific µ-receptor antagonist) has been shown
to reverse obd. this antagonist has an extensive first-pass
metabolism and results in an oral bioavailability of 2%. unfortunately, clinical trials have demonstrated a narrow therapeutic
index due to the possible triggering of analgesia reversal or systemic opioid withdrawal [20]. furthermore, a variable efficacy in
dosage among individual patients limits its clinical use [21]. similarly, nalmefene, a nonselective µ-receptor antagonist working
largely through its metabolite nalmefene glucuronide, has not
been shown to be clinically effective in ameliorating obd
without compromising analgesia [22].

the second approach of limiting how the antagonist crosses
the blood–brain barrier, thereby concentrating its binding efficacy to the peripheral µ-receptors, is a more promising area of
research. the first drug in this category is the nonselective
µ-receptor antagonist  xxxd2614xxx  [23]. naltrexone is a tertiary opioid receptor antagonist and is lipid soluble. this allows
it to cross into the cns and inhibit the efficacy of morphine.
the quaternary derivative of naltrexone is  xxxd2614xxx .
this has been shown to be poorly lipid soluble, does not cross
into the cns and does not antagonise the central analgesic
effects of morphine. this quaternary derivative is also relatively
resistant to demethylation to the tertiary form [24]. however, it
is a non-selective opioid receptor antagonist and the efficacy of
the drug is due to restriction of its activity to peripheral sites of
action. clinical trials have demonstrated that  xxxd2614xxx 
reverses obd without reversing analgesia [25], is effective in
enteric oral form [26] and may be used in patients on chronic
opioid agonists (methadone-maintenance programme) with
equal efficacy to methadone [127]. it is also available in intravenous form. the absorption following oral administration is
< 1 % and, although nonselective for the µ-receptors, it is
considered to be a µ-receptor preferred antagonist.
following the demonstration that peripherally restricted
opioid antagonists could be clinically successful, the development of a more selective peripheral µ-receptor antagonist with
limited cns action became the focus of research. this led to
the development of a compound known as  xxxd134xxx 
(ly-246376; adl 8-2968).
biochemistry of  xxxd134xxx 
 xxxd134xxx  was developed as a peripherally acting µ-receptor
antagonist. it has a molecular weight of 461 kda. it is a completely synthetic molecule with a large molecular weight and a
zwitterionic form ( xxxd134xxx .2h2o). this polarity limits
its gastrointestinal absorption and cns penetration. the
synthesis of  xxxd134xxx  is a 12-step process from 1,3-dimethyl-4-piperidone with a yield of 6.2%. the key reaction is
the cis-thermal elimination of a carbonate from an alkaloid at
190°c, with the key intermediate being the production of
(3r-4r)-3-(3,4-dimethyl-4-piperidinyl)phenol. the systemic
oral bioavailability is maintained by the size of a nitrogen substitution that augments the µ-receptor antagonist and restricts
the penetration of the blood–brain barrier. the resulting
compound is  xxxd134xxx  [28]. synonyms and analogues include adl-01-0160,
adl-01-0161,  xxxd134xxx  and ly-246736 labelled as (±)([2(s)–[(4[r]–(3-hydroxyphenyl)-3[r]4–dimethyl-1-piperidinyl)-methyl]1-oxo-3-phenylpropyl]-amino) acetic acid
dehydrate (figure 1).
4.1

pharmacology and kinetics of  xxxd134xxx 
 xxxd134xxx  has a greater affinity for the µ-receptor than for
the kappa- or sigma-opioid receptors. this translates as an inhibitory
constant (ki) of 0.77 nm for the µ-opioid receptor versus
40 (kappa-) and 4.4 nm (sigma-), respectively, for the other types

[29,30].

furthermore it does not demonstrate affinity for the
main non-opioid receptors including adrenergic ( xxxg87xxx   xxxg830xxx -,  xxxg831xxx -,
beta-), dopaminergic (d1, d2), 5-ht2, histamine (h1), gaba,
benzodiazepine or muscarinic receptors. it also demonstrates a
high affinity for the µ-opioid receptor relevant to the binding
of naloxone (ki = 3.7nm).

4.3 bioavailability

although essentially a peripherally acting µ-opioid antagonist,
 xxxd134xxx  may cross the blood–brain barrier at very high
concentrations in some animal species. this permits the
reversal of the centrally mediated analgesic action of morphine consistent with other drugs in this class. the peripheral
action, however, is preferential due to its high affinity for the
µ-opioid receptor and the polarity of the nitrogen substitute
that limits central mediation. intravenous administration
inhibits the peripheral µ-opioid receptors 200-fold more than
the central µ-receptor. in animal studies, restoration of bowel
function occurred in 50% of mice (1.1 mg/kg p.o.) as evidenced by the onset of diarrhoea in morphine-dependent
mice [27]. the absence of central antagonism was demonstrated in the mouse charcoal meal-test with  xxxd134xxx 
reversing morphine-induced constipation for > 8 h without a
clinical manifestation of morphine withdrawal. this demonstration of the efficacy of oral administration of  xxxd134xxx 
was twice the dose calculated for achieving the same result
using naloxone.

findings are consistent with significant first-pass hepatic
metabolism. the excretion pathway of the drug has been
assessed using [14c]- xxxd134xxx  following both oral and
intravenous administration. the urinary excretion is 0.4%
(oral ingestion) and 22% (intravenous administration). the
biliary excretion is 15% of the administered dose regardless
of the method of administration. in animal studies, there
has been no significant toxicity. these have used dosage
schedules of ≤ 500 mg/kg for mice and 20 mg/kg i.v. for
rats. the long-term safety assessment for a period of
6 months in both canine and rat models did not demonstrate any acute toxicity. however, the studies did not
address any fertility or teratogenic long-term outcomes.
5. clinical

trials

successful application in animal models has led to the progressive introduction of this new peripheral opioid receptor
antagonist to the clinical arena. to date,  xxxd134xxx  has completed phase i, ii and iii clinical trials. the clinically relevant
therapeutic target population consists of patients with obd;
this includes those on chronic opioid medication and potential amelioration of postoperative ileus. the phase ii clinical
trials have largely focused on assessing the role of  xxxd134xxx 
in shortening the period of postoperative ileus incurred in
patients after major abdominal surgery.
5.1 postoperative

4.4 metabolism,

distribution and clearance of

 xxxd134xxx 

the intravenous administration of  xxxd134xxx  results in a
dose-dependent increase in plasma concentration. in dogs and
rabbits, the serum half-life is reported as 10 min. tracer
[14c]- xxxd134xxx  studies demonstrate minimal distribution of
the drug in the blood compartment or sites other than the
µ-receptor; in particular, this includes the cerebral tissue.
there is no evidence of plasma compartment accumulation
and systemic metabolism is considered to be hepatic in origin.
the oral bioavailability is poor as reflected by poor systemic
absorption and oral doses of < 100 mg/kg in a canine model
produced low plasma levels (mean maximal concentration
[cmax] = 92.9 ng/ml).
the oral bioavailability is of the order of 0.03%. such
poor systemic bioavailability does not indicate a lack of efficacy, as oral administration produces high levels of clinical
gastrointestinal activity. the restricted distribution of  xxxd134xxx  in animal models has also been confirmed using
[14c]- xxxd134xxx  whole-body autoradiography in rats using
both oral and intravenous administration. this showed a
sparing of the brain and spinal cord in rats treated with  xxxd134xxx  consistent with its peripheral selective binding. in a
rat model following oral dosage of [14c]- xxxd134xxx 
200 mg/kg demonstrated a portal plasma concentration of
140 ng equivalents of 14c/ml at 1 hour whereas the mean
peak plasma concentration was only 20.5 ng/ml [27]. these

ileus
the transient period of enteric inertia after abdominal surgery
is termed postoperative ileus. this is a variable period of cessation of bowel function. it appears mandatory following
abdominal surgery but also occurs after other procedures. to
date, the exact criteria for defining postoperative ileus as
regards onset, duration and resolution of symptoms have not
been agreed on by any consensus group. apart from the surgical procedure itself, a major factor that is considered to contribute to the development of postoperative ileus is the
prescription of exogenous opiates [31]. it is clear that, after
major abdominal surgery, there is a period of initial bowel
inertia and this translates into an enforced delay in discharging patients from hospital after their surgery. the extent of
postoperative ileus combined with postoperative pain,
mechanical factors, such as drains and postoperative fatigue
all combine to extend the average postoperative stay after surgery to between 5 and 10 days in most reported series [32].
the direct result of this prolonged hospital stay is seen in
financial terms of an estimated $1.75 billion for 1.8 million
days spent in hospital in the us [33].
attempts to ameliorate the duration of postoperative ileus
have been undertaken by several units and together constitute the concept of ‘fast-track care pathways’ for expediting
recovery after surgery. these protocols involve early ambulation, early feeding, early transfer to oral-based analgesia, and
early removal or absence of nasogastric tubes, drains and
urinary catheters. using an aggressive postoperative care

plan of accelerated rehabilitation, basse et al. were able to
decrease their median length of stay from 8 days down to
2 days for patients undergoing open major abdominal surgery [34]. this prospective case control study used retrospective case controls and utilised epidural analgesia as part of
their protocol. the efficacy of epidural analgesia in shortening the duration of postoperative ileus have been somewhat
supported by a cochrane report [35], although the studies
used for this meta-analysis did not include fast-track care
pathways. similar results of shortening the length of stay by
adopting a ‘fast-track’ postoperative management plan have
been shown in the absence of epidural analgesia in other
units and, therefore, one must be aware of the independent
benefits of this approach when interpreting the data from
the  xxxd134xxx  clinical trials [36]. furthermore, in these trials,
the study end points of ‘time to first bowel motion’ and
‘time to hospital discharge’ must be viewed in the context of
clinical relevance for the patient. any improvements in the
rapidity of clinical recovery must, therefore, translate into
both a clinically relevant impact, as well as a financially
meaningful alteration in postoperative outcome. ultimately,
this should be reflected in a reduced length of hospital stay
for the patient or a reduction in other complications.
in all of the phase iii clinical trials that addressed the
effect of  xxxd134xxx  on postoperative ileus, the baseline care
in both placebo and treatment groups was similar to a ‘fasttrack’ postoperative-care programme. the control group and
those that received oral  xxxd134xxx  received postoperative
intravenous patient-controlled analgesia and had their
nasogastric tube removed at the end of surgery or within the
first postoperative day. they commenced liquids on the first
postoperative day and were offered solid food by day 2 using
standardised criteria and orders for advancement of diet.
these components constitute an accelerated postoperative
care pathway, and any reduction in the length of hospital stay
as a result of this approach should be equally applicable to
the treatment and control groups based on the double-blind
randomised construct of the trials.
5.2 phase

i trials
three phase i trials were undertaken using oral doses of  xxxd134xxx . the first was a double-blind placebo-controlled
crossover trial. a total of eight subjects (males 28 – 54 years)
were placed on loperamide (opioid agonist; 8 mg), which
resulted in constipation (p < 0.01). the colonic transit time
was assessed using serial radio-opaque marker screening. the
volunteers then received  xxxd134xxx  at 2.4 or 24 mg t.i.d.
over 4 days. the study demonstrated the reversal or blockade
of the loperamide-induced decrease in colonic transit time
with both dosing schedules [37]. in a second randomised, placebo-controlled, double-blind crossover study 13 healthy volunteers were assessed [38].  xxxd134xxx  3 mg p.o. t.i.d. for
4 days reversed morphine (30 mg b.i.d.)-induced colonic
hypomotility as measured by radio-opaque marker screened
colonic transit time (p < 0.05). the third study assessed oral

cecal transit time in 14 healthy volunteers using a 4-mg oral
dose [39]. this was a double-blind crossover study. the dose
of morphine used was 0.05 mg/kg and volunteers were
treated as follows: oral and intravenous placebo; oral placebo
and intravenous morphine; and  xxxd134xxx  4 mg p.o. and
intravenous morphine. the drug once again reversed the
morphine-induced delay in enteric transit time (p < 0.006).
the study also noted an absence of reversal of morphineinduced central effects using 45 further postoperative
patients in a double-blind fashion. there was no reversal of
morphine-induced pupillary constriction and efficacy of
analgesia. this trial had equal sex distribution in volunteers
and the oral cecal transit time was assessed using lactulose/
hydrogen breath tests. the end result was a reduction of transit time from a prolongation with morphine of 103 min to
near baseline. the manuscript concluded that  xxxd134xxx 
prevents morphine-induced increases in gastrointestinal transit time by means of selective peripheral opioid antagonism
without affecting central opioid analgesia.
5.3 phase

ii trials
opiate-use studies

5.3.1 chronic

two studies were conducted to assess the efficacy of  xxxd134xxx 
in patients with chronic opioid usage. the first enrolled
75 patients to assess safety and efficacy of  xxxd134xxx  with
increasing doses. a single dose was used in a dose-escalating
fashion using  xxxd134xxx  (0.5, 1.5 and 3 mg). the patients targeted had documented obd. the patients were administered
placebo or  xxxd134xxx  and it was demonstrated that the volume of stool, duration of onset to first stool and incidence of
dry hard stools were all decreased in those receiving  xxxd134xxx . the onset of action was as rapid as 6 h after commencing
treatment. notably, in those receiving the highest dose of  xxxd134xxx , 11 patients withdrew due to gut-specific withdrawal
symptoms. a second study assessed the dose efficacy and safety
of  xxxd134xxx  in 26 patients with chronic opioid usage. this
used increasing levels of  xxxd134xxx  over 4 days (0.5, 1.5, 3 and
4.5 mg). again, the efficacy of  xxxd134xxx  was demonstrated
with patients having an increased stool volume over controls
for the first 4 days of treatment. in this study, there was no
negative impact seen on analgesia or evidence of the onset of
signs of opioid withdrawal. the maximum response was seen
within 4 h of the 3-mg dose and 7 h of the lowest (0.5-mg)
dose. in these studies, some patients at the 3-mg dose reported
loose stools, diarrhoea and cramps. in a further preliminary
dose-escalation study of seven volunteers, one subject had
increased bowel frequencies after 0.25- and 1-mg doses of  xxxd134xxx . this cramping pain lasted 3.25 h and the subject was
withdrawn from further treatments.
5.3.2 postoperative

ileus
the efficacy of  xxxd134xxx  in ameliorating postoperative
ileus was assessed in a randomised, double-blind placebocontrolled study of 78 patients undergoing segmental colon
resection or abdominal hysterectomy [40]. the study assessed

the impact of  xxxd134xxx  on postoperative gastrointestinal
function and the length of postoperative hospital stay.
patients received one capsule of  xxxd134xxx  1 or 6 mg or an
identical placebo capsule 2 h before abdominal surgery and
then twice daily until the first bowel movement or until discharge from the hospital up to a maximum of 7 days. there
were 26 patients in each group and blinded observers
assessed the outcomes. this study demonstrated that those
administered  xxxd134xxx  6 mg had a significantly earlier
onset of the passage flatus (reduced from 70 to 49 h,
p = 0.03) and first bowel motion (from 111 to 70 h,
p = 0.01), and a decrease in length of hospital stay (from 91
to 68 h, p = 0.03). the authors concluded that  xxxd134xxx 
speeds recovery of bowel function and shortens hospitalisation of patients undergoing abdominal surgery. although
the results were clearly impressive, one of the main criticisms
of this paper is the nature of the surgery involved; the
patients had undergone partial colectomy (n = 15), simple
hysterectomy (n = 37) and radical hysterectomy (n = 26). as
reflected by the nature of the surgery, nearly all the patients
were female (n = 72). a total of four patients taking the placebo withdrew, as did eight patients receiving  xxxd134xxx 
(1 mg) capsules. nevertheless, the patients receiving the
6-mg capsules had significantly improved outcome scores,
with less nausea and time to hospital discharge.
5.4 phase

iii trials
 xxxd134xxx  has now completed four phase iii trials
(14cl302, 14cl306, 14cl308 and 14cl313) assessing its
use in the restoration of bowel function in patients having
undergone major abdominal surgery. some caution should be
noted in the interpretation of these results because, to date,
only 14cl313 has been formally published in the scientific
literature. 14cl302 is also discussed as it is in press and has
been presented at a national scientific meeting. there has also
been one completed phase iii trial assessing the efficacy of
 xxxd134xxx  in the treatment of obd in patients taking
chronic opioid medications (13cl304).
5.4.1 chronic

opiate-use studies
the obd phase iii trial (obd 13cl304) enrolled
168 patients and examined the efficacy of  xxxd134xxx  on
obd. these were patients that had chronic use of opioids,
such as morphine and codeine, with documented adverse
bowel function as a result of their opioid ingestion. the
dosing schedule was  xxxd134xxx  0.5 or 1 mg or placebo
daily for 21 days. the patients were then assessed with
regard to the number and frequency of bowel motions
recorded within the first 8 h of receiving  xxxd134xxx  compared with placebo. the results demonstrated that 43% of
patients receiving  xxxd134xxx  0.5 mg had a bowel motion
within 8 h; a result that was significant versus placebo
(p < 0.001). for those receiving 1 mg, the result was similar with 55% having early bowel motion versus 29% with
placebo (p < 0.001).

5.4.2 postoperative

ileus
14cl302 is a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial currently in press. this was a multi-centre study and enrolled
451 patients prior to surgery. the primary aim of the study
was to assess the efficacy of  xxxd134xxx  in postoperative recovery of bowel function. the surgery involved was abdominal
hysterectomy (30% of patients) or a segmental bowel resection (70%). there were three groups; placebo (n = 153),  xxxd134xxx  6 mg (n = 152) and 12 mg (n = 146). the patients
received the study medication 2 h prior to surgery and twice
daily thereafter for a maximum of 7 days. the primary end
point of the study was the return of bowel function, which
was defined as “the later of the following two events: time
that the patient first tolerated solid food (recovery of upper
gastrointestinal function), and the time that the patient first
passed either flatus or a bowel movement (recovery of lower
gastrointestinal function)”. in the 6-mg group, this was a
mean of 86.2 versus 100.3 h for those receiving placebo. this
was significant compared with controls (cox proportional
hazard model: hazard ratio 1.47, p = 0.058). in those receiving the 12-mg dose, a statistical significance was not
achieved; however, the study did show a positive trend over
placebo (p = 0.0.58), with a similar reduction in hours. the
most frequently reported adverse side effects were nausea,
vomiting and abdominal distension, without any increase in
the placebo group (table 1).
14cl313 was a double-bind, placebo-controlled, multi-centre trial to assess the efficacy of  xxxd134xxx  on ameliorating the
effects of postoperative ileus, primarily in patients undergoing
segmental bowel resection [41]. the study enrolled
510 patients, of which 469 patients participated. as in the
other studies, patients received placebo, or  xxxd134xxx  6 or
12 mg 2 h prior to surgery and twice daily until discharge or
a maximum of 7 days after surgery. the composition of the
placebo- and  xxxd134xxx -treated groups were similar. the surgery involved was abdominal, being either segmental bowel
resection (96% of patients) or radical hysterectomy (4%). of
those having a bowel resection, the resection was of small
bowel in 9.2% of those receiving placebo, 16.4% of those that
received  xxxd134xxx  6 mg and 16.7% of the 12-mg  xxxd134xxx 
group. as defined in prestudy criteria, patients needing a
stoma because of intra-operative findings were excluded, as
were those with epidurals and cases where a nasogastric tube
was left in situ postoperatively. these patients did remain in
the study for assessment of adverse events, due to the preoperative dose received. the study group included those undergoing colon and rectal cancer surgery as well as surgery for
inflammatory conditions such as crohn’s disease and diverticulitis. the final three groups numbered placebo (n = 149),
 xxxd134xxx  6 mg (n = 155) and 12 mg (n = 165). the sex distribution was equal in this study. in the 6-mg group there was
a mean difference in return to bowel function of 14.6 h,
which was significant from placebo (hazard ratio 1.28,
p < 0.05). in the 12-mg group, again there was a significantly
earlier return of bowel function (mean difference 22 h, hazard

ratio 1.54, p < 0.01) (figure 2). in both treatment groups a
statistically significant earlier return to tolerating solids was
observed. interestingly more patients discontinued treatment
with placebo than with  xxxd134xxx  for adverse effects such as
nausea, vomiting and hypotension.
in both of these studies (14cl302, 14cl313), the most
common adverse events were nausea and vomiting. there were
no significant differences for these main adverse effects between
the treated and control groups. noticeably, the overall trend
was to have increased gastrointestinal problems with placebo. in
the 14cl302 study, serious adverse events were encountered in
12.5% of patients; this included 28 patients in the placebo
group: 13 in the 6-mg-treated group and 15 in the 12-mgtreated group. there were three mortalities in this study, none
of which were considered to be related to the study protocol. in
the 14cl313 study, only two (1.2%) patients in the placebo
group, five (3%) patients in the  xxxd134xxx  6-mg group, and no
patients in the 12-mg group had serious adverse effects.
14cl306 enrolled 519 patients to assess the safety and efficacy of  xxxd134xxx  for the amelioration of postoperative ileus.
14cl308 is the largest of the studies to date and also aimed to
assess the efficacy of  xxxd134xxx  in ameliorating gastrointestinal dysfunction in the postoperative patient; 666 patients
were enrolled. the results were presented by adolor corporation in a public release, but have yet to be formally published
in a scientific journal.
in summary, three phase iii trials assessing the efficacy of
 xxxd134xxx  in postoperative ileus and one assessing dosage

safety have been completed. when all studies are considered,
> 2000 patients have been evaluated. the results show that the
dose of 6 mg results in a significantly earlier return of gastrointestinal function after major abdominal surgery (14cl302 and
14cl313). patients receiving  xxxd134xxx  12 mg had an earlier
return of bowel function in two studies (14cl313) and a positive trend in the third (14cl302, p = 0.11). the phase iii trial
assessing safety (14cl306) demonstrated good tolerance of
 xxxd134xxx  using the 12-mg dose, with 93% of patients completing the study. the remaining phase iii study (14cl304)
assessed the efficacy of  xxxd134xxx  in treating obd in patients
with a history of chronic opioid usage. this phase iii trial also
showed significant benefit in restoration of gastrointestinal
function in these patients. to date, complications have not
been reported as being more frequent in a treatment group
compared with patients receiving placebo.
6. conclusion

over the past decade, there has been a progressive evolution
of standardised postoperative care plans in treating patients
who have undergone major abdominal surgery. these evidence-based changes have attempted to reduce the magnitude of the gastrointestinal and systemic insult following
abdominal surgery in order to expedite patient recovery and
outcome. the absence of nasogastric tube placement after
surgery in a meta-analysis of 26 trials has been shown to
decrease postoperative morbidity but not decrease

postoperative ileus [42]. early ambulation, early feeding,
restriction of intraoperative fluids, use of epidural anaesthesia
and gum chewing have all been incorporated into accelerated
postoperative care pathways [43,44]. using these postoperative
care programmes, the mean length of stay for a patient
undergoing major abdominal surgery may be reduced to
3.5 – 5.5 days [42,45]. furthermore, patients undergoing
laparoscopic colorectal surgery, combined with a ‘fast-track’
postoperative care programme, may have their mean length
of stay reduced to < 3 days [46].
in both the 14cl302 and 14cl313 trials, the mean length
of stay (‘hospital discharge order written’) for the patients that
were treated with placebo ranged from 5.08 (14cl302) to
6.08 days (14cl313). the introduction of  xxxd134xxx  was
able to reduce this ‘time to writing hospital discharge order’
by a range of 7.2 – 20 h, depending on the dose used and
patient population being studied. the mixed surgical population (simple hysterectomy, radical hysterectomy, colonic, rectal and small bowel resections) may be an explanatory factor
for these differences in outcome.
a meta-analysis of the studies performed to date examining
outcomes related to specific indications for surgery (bowel
resection versus hysterectomy) has not been reported. the
results of this may help direct optimal clinical use of this agent.
486

finally, the efficacy of  xxxd134xxx  in reducing the length of stay
in hospital has not been studied in the setting of laparoscopic
colorectal surgery, and this will probably not be evaluated until
after approval of the medication by the fda.
7. summary

 xxxd134xxx  represents the first orally available, peripherally
restricted opioid antagonist that successfully demonstrates
peripheral µ-receptor selectivity. the drug has completed five
phase iii clinical trials enrolling > 2000 patients. the drug
seems to have good tolerance without any evidence of serious
adverse side effects, and a reduction in side effects over that
seen with placebo. clinical efficacy of early restoration of
gastrointestinal function in patients following surgery and in
those with a history of obd has been demonstrated. no longterm clinical studies on toxicology, tolerance and teratogenicity
are currently available.

estimated as costing $750 million in 1986 to the us healthcare system [47]. attempts to reduce this period of gastrointestinal dysfunction have included the use of prokinetics
(erythromycin and  xxxd2624xxx ) and nasogastric intubation, but have met with little success [48,49]. the introduction
of laparoscopic colorectal surgery, early postoperative feeding,
the use of thoracic epidural analgesia and perhaps even chewing gum have already demonstrated an improvement in the
early restoration of gastrointestinal function [50]. these diverse
approaches outline the complexity of factors involved in the
onset and resolution of postoperative bowel dysfunction.  xxxd134xxx  has been introduced as a prototype selective µ-opioid
receptor antagonist. the therapeutic rationale of selectively
inhibiting the deleterious gastrointestinal effects of opioids,
whether from the inherent postoperative endogenous opioid
surge or that of exogenous opioid administration, has been
borne out by successful phase iii trials.
it remains unclear at present what impact the addition of  xxxd134xxx  may have in the setting of a multimodality approach to
postoperative care, including early introduction of diet, laparoscopic surgery, and with or without epidural-based analgesia,
‘gum chewing’ and fluid restriction. it is probable that the effect
will mirror those seen in the phase iii studies, as all study patients
(including placebo) were maintained on fast-track type pathways.

as  xxxd134xxx  is an opioid antagonist, the efficacy of restoration of gastrointestinal function in patients with obd
is both practical and highly encouraging. two remaining
issues relating to the introduction of  xxxd134xxx  for postoperative ileus include deciding on a 6- or 12-mg dose, and
the cost of treatment. continuing analysis of all trial
results will help decide the optimum dosing protocol and
the most suitable patients for use. the final cost of the
product will determine how this drug can be most effectively integrated into postoperative care plans following
abdominal surgery. nevertheless,  xxxd134xxx  is a very exciting product as the first of its type, which offers real clinical
improvements without serious adverse events. further
studies will determine the role of this medication for those
undergoing laparoscopic bowel surgery, or those requiring
a stoma; groups that have not been evaluated to date.
although the phase iii trial completed that addressed
obd was relatively small in number, the potential for this
new drug is promising.  xxxd134xxx  is the only selective µ-opioid receptor antagonist to have completed phase iii efficacy
trials and, as such, represents the first in a hopefully new generation of well-tolerated, peripherally restricted µ-opioid
receptor antagonists that will have significant impact both
clinically and on an economic healthcare basis.
