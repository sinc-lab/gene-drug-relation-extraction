abstract
introduction: serotonin dysfunction has been linked to a variety of psychiatric diseases; however, an adequate spect radioligand to probe
the serotonin transporter system has not been successfully developed. the purpose of this study was to characterize and determine the in vivo
selectivity of iodine-123-labeled 2beta-carbomethoxy-3beta-(4′-((z)-2-iodoethenyl)phenyl)nortropane, [123i]p  xxxd2078xxx , in nonhuman primate brain.
methods: two ovariohysterectomized female baboons participated in nine studies (one bolus and eight bolus to constant infusion at a ratio of
9.0 h) to evaluate [123i]p  xxxd2078xxx . to evaluate the selectivity of [123i]p  xxxd2078xxx , the serotonin transporter blockers fenfluramine (1.5, 2.5 mg/kg)
and citalopram (5 mg/kg), the  xxxg2149xxx  blocker methylphenidate (0.5 mg/kg) and the norepinephrine transporter blocker nisoxetine
(1 mg/kg) were given at 8 h post-radiotracer injection.
results: in the bolus to constant infusion studies, equilibrium was established by 4–8 h. [123i]p  xxxd2078xxx  was 93% and 90% protein bound in
the two baboons and there was no detection of lipophilic radiolabeled metabolites entering the brain. in the high-density serotonin transporter
regions (diencephalon and brainstem), fenfluramine and citalopram resulted in 35–71% and 129–151% displacement, respectively, whereas
methylphenidate and nisoxetine did not produce significant changes (b10%).
conclusion: these findings suggest that [123i]p  xxxd2078xxx  is a favorable compound for in vivo spect imaging of serotonin transporters with
negligible binding to norepinephrine and dopamine transporters.

serotonin from the synapse, which ideally results in a
homeostatic serotonergic tone, but in some individuals this
is disturbed. for example, individuals with major depression
have reduced serotonin transporter availability compared to
healthy subjects [5], which may predict treatment response to
selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors that act at the serotonin
transporter [6]. additionally, patients with generalized social
anxiety disorder have higher serotonin transporter availability compared to healthy subjects [7]. the importance of
understanding the biological underpinnings of these disorders has led to a search for development of a selective highaffinity serotonin transporter radioligand.
several radiotracers with serotonin transporter binding have
been developed and widely used, such as the tropane
derivatives [123 i]beta-cit [8,9] and [123 i]nor-beta-cit

[10,11]; however, these radiotracers are limited by poor
selectivity for the serotonin transporter vs. the dopamine
transporter. the most successful radiotracers have been labeled
with carbon-11 for pet imaging, most notably [11c]dasb
[12,13], and related structures such as [11c]madam [14,15],
which bind with high affinity and specificity. more limited
success has been observed with spect agents, such as
[123i]adam [16,17]. in general, these radiotracers are limited
in their ability to measure serotonin transporters throughout the
cortex, which is critical to understanding the role of executive
function including goal-oriented behavior in psychiatric
disorders. iodine-123-labeled 2beta-carbomethoxy-3beta-(4′-((z)2-iodoethenyl)phenyl)nortropane ([123i]p  xxxd2078xxx ) is a tropane
analog previously developed and synthesized [18] that
demonstrates high affinity (kd=0.03 nm) and high specificity for binding to the 5-ht transporter compared to the
dopamine (100-fold) and norepinephrine (500-fold) transporters. the purpose of the present study was to evaluate and
determine the selectivity of [123i]p  xxxd2078xxx  as a single photon
emission computed tomography (spect) radiotracer for the
serotonin transporter in nonhuman primate brain.
2. materials and methods
2.1. general
no-carrier-added sodium [123i]iodide in 0.1n naoh
(radionuclidic purity n99.8%) was obtained from mds
nordion (vancouver, bc, canada). other reagents were of
analytical grade and were obtained from conventional
chemical suppliers. preparative hplc was carried out on 5mum novapak c18 (waters corp., milford, ma, usa)
columns (300×3.9 mm stainless steel) with a mobile phase
of ch3oh/h2o/et3n (80:20:0.2, vol/vol/vol) and a flow rate
of 1.0 ml/min. blood samples were collected at the midpoint
of each scan to evaluate differences in metabolism and
protein binding of [123i]p  xxxd2078xxx  between animals and
studies. after centrifugation of whole blood, the plasma was
separated and treated with an equal volume of acetonitrile and
the denatured protein was removed by centrifugation. the
supernatant was analyzed on a high-sensitivity hplc system,
consisting of a spectra-physics sp8810 pump, a waters 484
ultraviolet (uv) detector and a home-built in-line flowthrough nai (t1) scintillation detector and a rate meter, using
a mobile phase of ch3oh/h2o/et3n (85:15:0.2, vol/vol/vol)
on a radial compression module rcm-100 (waters) and a
flow rate of 1.0 ml/min. total plasma radioactivity was
measured in an automatic well-type gamma counter (lkb
1282 compugamma cs with 2-in. crystal; wallac oy, turku,
finland), with a window spanning 159 kev. the counting
efficiency of the counter (efficiency=0.687) was determined
using sources of 123i calibrated in a gas ionization chamber
(capintec crc-727 dose calibrator) with geometry similar to
that of the blood samples. all radioactivity measurements
were decay corrected to the time of radiopharmaceutical
administration using t1/2=13.2 h.

2.2. chemistry
[123 i]p  xxxd2078xxx  was prepared by iododestannylation of the
trimethylstannyl precursor with sodium [123i]iodide and
peracetic acid as oxidizing agent at room temperature, as
described previously [18]. purification by reversed-phase
hplc with concomitant uv and radioactivity detection
allowed identity confirmation of [123i]p  xxxd2078xxx  by comparison to its corresponding unlabelled analog. the final dosage
form was in the form of sterile isotonic saline containing 5%
(vol/vol) ethanol and 0.2 mm l- xxxd228xxx  (final ph of 5–
6). based on the elution profile, [123i]p  xxxd2078xxx  was obtained
with a no-carrier-added radiochemical yield of 32.9±13.5%
(n=9) and radiochemical purity of 95.1±3.4% (n=9).
2.3. in vivo spect imaging
two ovariohysterectomized female baboons (papio
anubis, 15 and 20 kg) participated in nine studies separated
by 2 to 4 weeks. these studies were carried out under
institutional animal care protocols in compliance with federal
regulations. animals were fasted for 18–24 h prior to the
study. animals were initially anesthetized with ketamine (10
mg/kg im) and then maintained on isoflurane (2–3%)
anesthesia via an endotracheal tube for the duration of the
study.  xxxd2220xxx  (10 mug/kg im), a long-acting peripheral anticholinergic drug that does not cross the blood–brain
barrier, was administered with the initial ketamine injection
to decrease respiratory and digestive secretions. vital signs
including heart rate, respiration rate, oxygen saturation and
body temperature were continuously monitored and recorded
every 30 min. body temperature was kept constant at 37°c
with a heated water blanket. an intravenous line was placed in
one leg for bolus injection and infusion of the radiotracer and
for injection of nonradioactive drugs. a second intravenous
line was placed in the other leg in order to obtain blood
samples and for infusion of lactated  xxxd3213xxx  solution, which
was maintained at a rate of 1.8 ml/kg per hour for the duration
of the study. in one study (the bolus only), an arterial line was
placed to collect blood samples for kinetic modeling. the
baboon's head was immobilized in the gantry with a
vacuumed beanbag (olympic medical, seattle, wa, usa).
the animals participated in bolus-only and equilibrium (bolus
plus constant infusion) studies. to assess the pharmacological
specificity of [123 i]p  xxxd2078xxx , the serotonin transporter
blockers fluoxetine (1.5, 2.5 mg/kg iv) and citalopram
(5 mg/kg iv), the  xxxg2149xxx  blocker methylphenidate (0.5 mg/kg iv) and the norepinephrine transporter
blocker nisoxetine (1 mg/kg iv) were administered at 8 h
post-radiotracer injection in the equilibrium studies. all
drugs were obtained from sigma (st. louis, mo, usa),
mixed with saline and administered at the described doses.
2.3.1. spect data acquisition
spect data were acquired with the nonhuman primate
brain-dedicated multislice ceraspect camera (digital
scintigraphics, waltham, ma, usa). the camera has a

k.p. cosgrove et al. / nuclear medicine and biology 37 (2010) 587–591

resolution in all three axes of approximately 12 mm full width
at half maximum measured with a 123i line source in a 20-cm
water-filled cylindrical phantom. the distribution of [123i]p
 xxxd2078xxx  was assessed after one bolus-only (277.5 mbq) and in
eight bolus (163.5±22.3 mbq) plus constant infusion
(17.6±1.9 mbq/h) studies at a ratio of 9.0 h for up to 10 h.
brain images (128×128×64 matrix; pixel size=1.67×1.67
mm; slice thickness=1.67 mm; voxel volume=4.66 mm3)
were acquired into a 159-kev (±10%) energy window, in step
and shoot mode at 15 min each for up to 600 min total per
study and up to 37 acquisitions per study. for the equilibrium
scan with citalopram, 40 acquisitions were obtained during an
11-h study. images were reconstructed using a ramp and
butterworth filter (cutoff=0.65 cm, power factor=10).
magnetic resonance imaging (mri) scans were obtained
for each animal with a 1.5-t ge signa device (general
electric, milwaukee, wi, usa). axial images were acquired
using a spoiled gradient recall acquisition in the steady state
sequence with tr=25 ms, te=5 ms, nex=2, matrix=256×192, field of view=16 cm.
2.3.2. image analysis
spect images were reconstructed, attenuation corrected
and analyzed as previously described [19]. briefly, reconstructed images were coregistered to each animal's mri and
region-of-interest analyses were performed. regions chosen
were those known to contain serotonin transporters including
diencephalon, brainstem, basal ganglia, and right and left
hippocampus, and cortical regions including the right and left
temporal and occipital. the cerebellum (average of left and
right hemispheres) was measured as a reference region, e.g., a
region devoid of serotonin transporters. the activity in the
whole brain was also measured in the bolus-only study using
a contour formed around the edge of the brain on the mri.
average regional activities were decay corrected to the time
of injection and were expressed as kilobecquerel per milliliter
and as percent injected dose (%id) for whole brain in the bolusonly study. for equilibrium studies, the primary outcome
measure is the binding potential (bpnd), which is the ratio of
specific to nonspecific binding with the cerebellum as the
reference region. equilibrium was obtained between 4 and 8 h,
operationally defined as b5% change per hour. to determine
the displacement of [123i]p  xxxd2078xxx  by the displacement agents,
the percent change in bpnd pre- (average of two scans prior to
the displacement) and post (average of two final scans)
displacement was calculated and expressed as a percent.

allowed an operational definition of the components of
plasma radioactivity (table 1) as two metabolites with
polarity greater than that of [123i]p  xxxd2078xxx : (1) lipophilic
fraction which decreased over time; (2) a transient polar
fraction; and (3) a polar component that increased over time.
the lipophilic component was identified as unmetabolized
[123i]p  xxxd2078xxx , which rapidly decreased from 69%, at the
time of peak level of radioactivity in arterial plasma (4–7
min), to 9% at 60 min and to 4% at 180 min. the abundance
of the combined two polar metabolite fractions as a percent
of total plasma activity increased from 31% at 3 min to 96%
at 180 min postinjection. the transient fraction reached its
peak at 3–5 min (26%), then decreased to 1% at 180 min.
the characterization of the polar metabolites was not deemed
necessary because of their improbable brain permeability.
3.2. spect data
after administration of [123 i]p  xxxd2078xxx  by bolus
intravenous injection, whole brain uptake occurred at 74
min and corresponded to 2.3% of the original injected
dose. the regional uptake of [123 i]p  xxxd2078xxx  was assessed
with bolus and equilibrium studies. the regional rank
order of potency (brainstemndiencephalonnbasal ganglianhippocampusncingulate cortexnoccipital cortexn
cerebellum) was consistent between bolus and equilibrium
studies and is consistent with the known anatomical distribution
of 5-ht transporters (fig. 1). with the use of the bolus to
constant infusion paradigm, equilibrium was established in all
studies between 4 and 8 h with b5% change per hour (fig. 1).
the in vivo pharmacological specificity of [123 i]p  xxxd2078xxx 
was assessed by displacement studies with the selective
serotonin 3 transporter blockers fluoxetine and citalopram,
the dopamine 4 transporter blocker methylphenidate and the
norepinephrine transporter blocker nisoxetine. fluoxetine
and citalopram produced a robust, rapid displacement of
[123i]p  xxxd2078xxx  in all regions studied, but no significant
changes were seen after administration of methylphenidate or
nisoxetine (table 2). in addition, with the arterial blood data
collected in the bolus-only study, mrtm2 analysis was
conducted using cerebellum as the reference region. bpnd
values using mrtm2 (diencephalon: 1.48; brainstem: 1.34;

up to 10 h. brain regions are diencephalon (dien), brainstem (bstem), hippocampus (ha), basal ganglia (bg), temporal insular cortex (tic), occipital cortex

were consistent with bpnd values calculated as an average
from the equilibrium scans prior to displacement in the same
animal (diencephalon: 1.04; brainstem: 1.34; basal ganglia:
0.81; hippocampus: 0.82; temporal cortex: 0.22). these bpnd
values were notably lower than those in the second animal
(diencephalon: 3.83; brainstem: 4.32; basal ganglia: 2.9;
hippocampus: 2.07; temporal cortex: 1.28), illustrating the
individual variability in serotonin transporter availability.
4. discussion
in this study, we examined the time course, distribution
and specificity of [123 i]p  xxxd2078xxx  in baboon brain. importantly, we detected no radiometabolites that are capable of
entering the brain. since we could not detect the formation of
lipophilic radiolabeled metabolites capable of entering the
brain, the calculation of the [123i]p  xxxd2078xxx  input function and
subsequent quantification of binding sites by tracer kinetic

modeling could be performed in the future without correcting
for lipophilic metabolites. consistent with a previous study
[18], after bolus injection, [123 i]p  xxxd2078xxx  entered the brain
rapidly and reached a peak uptake in the highest density
regions (diencephalon, brainstem and basal ganglia) between
130 and 277 min postinjection, and in lower density regions
(temporal and occipital cortex) peaked as early as 50 to 74
min. whole brain uptake peaked at 74 min and was 2.3% of
the injected dose. although bolus injection of [123i]p  xxxd2078xxx 
appears to approach an equilibrium, bolus to constant
infusion at a ratio of 9.0 h resulted in a sustained equilibrium
between 4 and 8 h with b5% change per hour. additionally,
there is a consistency in bpnd values obtained from mrtm2
and at equilibrium further supporting the use of equilibrium
studies with this tracer.
in a series of constant infusion studies, the specificity of
[123 i]p  xxxd2078xxx  was evaluated with displacement by the
serotonin transporter blockers fluoxetine and citalopram,
the  xxxg2149xxx  blocker methylphenidate and the

norepinephrine transporter blocker nisoxetine. generally,
these results confirm that [123 i]p  xxxd2078xxx  uptake in brain
primarily reflects binding to serotonin 5 transporters.
specifically, moderate doses of fluoxetine (1.5–2.5 mg/kg)
resulted in displacement of the radiotracer by 46–53% in the
diencephalon and brainstem. a high dose of citalopram
(5 mg/kg) resulted in robust displacement of 69–72% in
diencephalon and brainstem. these findings suggest that
[123 i]p  xxxd2078xxx  is a favorable compound for in vivo spect
imaging of serotonin transporters with negligible binding to
norepinephrine and dopamine transporters.
[123 i]p  xxxd2078xxx  was the first compound prepared and
studied of the  xxxd2078xxx -like compounds. [123i]p  xxxd2078xxx  was
targeted for spect because of the ease of incorporating an i123 into the structure. in general, this study suggests that
[123i]p  xxxd2078xxx  is a good spect compound because it has slow
kinetics resulting in high binding in serotonin transporter-rich
regions compared to the cerebellum, a serotonin transporterdevoid region. [123i]p  xxxd2078xxx  has similar slow kinetics to
[123i]adam but higher signal to background. the slow
kinetics of [123i]p  xxxd2078xxx  can be attributed to its very high
serotonin transporter binding affinity (∼0.05 nm). this is the
highest reported serotonin transporter binding affinity of a
spect radioligand with attractive physiochemical properties. analogs of pzient have also been prepared as
pet compounds when labeled with f-18. specifically,
betafepzient is a pet serotonin transporter radioligand that
was designed based upon pzient. the iodovinyl pharmacophore was retained for its high serotonin transporter
binding affinity and selectivity over  xxxg2149xxx 
and norepinephrine transporter. the f-18 was introduced in
the ester as a fluoroethyl group. this pet radiotracer had
similar pharmacologic and imaging properties to pzient.
thus, radiolabeling betafepzient with i-123 would show no
advantage over pzient. betafemzient, which has a
serotonin transporter affinity of approximately 0.5 nm, is a
pet serotonin transporter radioligand designed based upon
mzient and results in a radioligand with faster kinetics and
better compatibility for pet. the slow kinetics of pzient
make it less desirable as a c-11-labeled pet compound than
as a f-18-labeled betafepzient. in general, the results from
this study and comparisons to similar tracers suggest that
[123 i]p  xxxd2078xxx  is a suitable compound for in vivo spect
imaging of serotonin transporters.
