retinoids and psoriasis: novel issues in
retinoid pharmacology and implications for
psoriasis treatment
j-h saurat, md geneva, switzerland
oral synthetic retinoids have been established as effective systemic therapy for psoriasis since their
introduction for clinical use in the 1970s.  xxxd71xxx , the free acid of  xxxd2071xxx  and its active metabolite, has
replaced  xxxd2071xxx  as the retinoid of choice for treating psoriasis because of its more favorable
pharmacokinetic profile. despite the demonstrated clinical success of retinoid therapy in psoriasis and
other proliferative skin disorders, their mechanism of action has not been fully elucidated. altered vitamin
a metabolism, characterized by an increase in the formation of  xxxd3417xxx , has been demonstrated in
psoriatic lesions and is potentially influenced by cytokines such as  xxxg1141xxx , which is present in
high levels in these lesions. synthetic retinoids such as  xxxd71xxx  may interfere with such cytokine-induced
alterations. studies on nuclear  xxxd3417xxx  receptors have shown that  xxxd71xxx  activates all 3 receptor
subtypes ( xxxg1931xxx , -beta, and -gamma) without measurable receptor binding; this paradox remains
unexplained. further studies on nuclear receptor binding and activity, including possible receptor crosstalk
with vitamin d nuclear receptors, promise to enhance understanding of the usefulness of retinoids in
treatment of psoriasis. (j am acad dermatol 1999;41:s2-6.)

t

he discovery that  xxxd3105xxx  metabolites
known as retinoids were effective agents in
treating psoriasis represented a major advance in the development of therapies for the disease. oral synthetic retinoids were introduced for
clinical use for cancer and other proliferative disorders in the early 1970s.  xxxd2071xxx , the first such
compound to be used in the treatment of psoriasis,
yielded positive results both as monotherapy and in
combination with puva and other treatment modalities. however, concerns about the safety of  xxxd2071xxx  related to its teratogenicity and long elimination half-life, resulting from storage in fat tissues,
caused a waning of interest in its clinical use in the
1980s.
with the late 1980s introduction of  xxxd71xxx , the
free acid of  xxxd2071xxx , interest in retinoids as systemic treatment for psoriasis has been renewed.
 xxxd71xxx , the pharmacologically active metabolite of
 xxxd2071xxx , is 50 times less lipophilic than  xxxd2071xxx 

and has an elimination half-life of 2 days compared
with 100 days for  xxxd2071xxx .1 unlike  xxxd2071xxx ,
 xxxd71xxx  is not stored in adipose tissue, although evidence suggesting that small amounts of  xxxd71xxx  may
be reesterified to  xxxd2071xxx  under certain conditions
has raised concerns about long-term effects.1 like
 xxxd2071xxx ,  xxxd71xxx  has been shown to be effective
both as monotherapy and in combination with other
psoriasis treatments.1
despite the clinical efficacy of retinoids in the
treatment of psoriasis, the mechanism of their therapeutic action has not been established. evidence to
date has pointed to altered  xxxd3105xxx  metabolism in
psoriasis. studies aided by molecular biological techniques have suggested that synthetic retinoids may
interfere with these changes. the results of ongoing
studies correlating clinical activity and cellular effects
of retinoids promise to improve their effectiveness
in the treatment of psoriasis.

interest in  xxxd3105xxx  metabolites for treating psoriasis resulted from research on their use as anticancer agents. in initial animal studies conducted in
the early 1970s,  xxxd2071xxx  was found to be effective
in reducing skin papillomas induced by topical application of oncogenic substances in mice.2 this finding
led to studies on the use of retinoids for other proliferative skin disorders.3 in addition, because psori-

altered differentiation,  xxxd3105xxx  derivatives, known
to have antiproliferative activity and to promote cellular differentiation, were expected to reverse the
disease process.

alteration in the cellular
retinoid pathways in psoriasis
although the mechanisms involved in the onset
of psoriasis are not fully understood, studies have
suggested that altered cellular metabolism of vitamin
a may be associated with the disease process.
studies examining each step of the cellular retinoid
pathway in psoriatic skin compared with normal skin
have been conducted.

basic cellular retinoid pathway
the basic cellular pathway leading to conversion
of retinol, the naturally occurring form of  xxxd3105xxx ,
to  xxxd3417xxx  (atra), the biologically
active ligand that binds to cellular receptors, has
been well-characterized (fig 1). retinol is first converted to retinal by the enzyme retinol dehydrogenase in a reversible reaction. retinal, in turn, is converted to atra by retinal dehydrogenase. a binding
protein, designated cellular retinol binding protein-i
( xxxg1938xxx  1), facilitates these enzymatic reactions. two
additional binding proteins known as cellular
 xxxd3417xxx  binding proteins, or crabp 1 and
crabp 2, are thought to act, at least in part, to buffer
the levels of free atra in the cell by sequestrating

atra and by promoting metabolism of atra by
cytochrome p450 enzymes belonging to the newly
characterized family cyp 26.4
atra is the active ligand that binds to the 3
known types of nuclear  xxxd3417xxx  receptors (rars
alpha, beta, and gamma), which mediate the cellular
effects of  xxxd3417xxx . 9-cis- xxxd3417xxx  is the natural ligand of nuclear retinoid x receptors, (rxrs)
and also binds to rars.5
alterations found in psoriatic skin
investigation of the cellular retinoid pathway in
both normal skin and psoriatic skin lesions has
involved assessment of retinoid levels, as well as the
activity of enzymes, binding proteins, and retinoid
receptors.
examining possible alterations in absolute levels
of  xxxd3105xxx  metabolites associated with psoriasis,
rollman and vahlquist6 found no significant difference in baseline levels of  xxxd3417xxx  precursors,
retinol and dehydroretinol, in nonlesional or lesional psoriatic skin compared with normal skin. in this
study, however, levels of  xxxd3417xxx  and dehydroretinoic acid were not detectable in either psoriatic or normal skin samples, likely because of the
detection limits of the methods used.
assessment of the rate of  xxxd3417xxx  formation
by cytosolic extracts loaded with radiolabeled retinal
and retinol precursors, however, has demonstrated
increased production of  xxxd3417xxx  by extracts
from psoriatic skin compared with normal skin. this
suggests increased activity of both enzymes involved
in cellular atra production in psoriatic skin (fig 2).7
measurement of binding proteins showed significantly higher levels of the atra-buffering protein
crabp 2 in extracts from psoriatic plaques compared with those of normal skin.8-11
the overall pattern of binding protein expression
seen in psoriasis parallels that seen in normal skin

exposed to exogenous  xxxd3417xxx  (table i).12 thus,
although the study by rollman and vahlquist6 failed
to provide direct evidence of increased  xxxd3417xxx 
in psoriatic plaques because of methodologic limitations, indirect evidence suggests that psoriatic
plaques are likely to have higher concentrations of
 xxxd3417xxx  than normal skin.
in studies of  xxxd3417xxx  nuclear receptors, no
significant changes in rar gene expression or levels
of rar and rxr proteins have been found to be associated with psoriasis.13,14
taken together, studies of the cellular retinoid
pathway suggest that alterations in  xxxd3417xxx 
metabolism in psoriatic skin are similar to those seen
in normal skin in response to a  xxxd3417xxx  load.
these alterations include increased expression of
the binding protein crabp 2, which likely serves to
sequester excess atra.4
effect of  xxxg1141xxx  and other cytokines
psoriasis is increasingly considered to be a disease
mediated by a th 1 type cytokine network. recent
observations suggest that altered  xxxd3105xxx  metabolism in psoriatic lesions is a secondary event resulting
from the activity of these cytokines. support for this
theory has included studies on  xxxg1141xxx 
(ifn gamma), a th1 type cytokine present in high levels in
psoriatic skin. törmä, rollman, and vahlquist15 have
recently reported that exposure to ifn gamma resulted in
increased production of  xxxd3417xxx  from precursors such as retinol in cultured keratinocytes. the
extent to which the resultant increase in  xxxd3417xxx 
contributes to the expression of the psoriatic phenotype (characterized by aberrant differentiation)
remains to be demonstrated.

therapeutic effect of  xxxd71xxx 
given the evidence suggesting that psoriasis
involves altered  xxxd3105xxx  metabolism resulting in
high levels of  xxxd3417xxx  in psoriatic plaques, the
fact that retinoid therapy is effective for psoriasis
treatment appears to represent a paradox.
explanations for this apparent paradox are presently
hypothetical.
hypotheses as to how  xxxd71xxx  may act to disrupt
the psoriatic disease process include several possible
mechanisms. although based on indirect observations, they provide useful models for further investigation into the mechanism of action of  xxxd71xxx  in
psoriasis.
first,  xxxd71xxx  may inhibit the cytokine-induced
increase in  xxxd3417xxx  formation. this is supported
by the finding that  xxxd71xxx  inhibits the enzymatic
formation of  xxxd3417xxx  from retinol.16 the effect
of  xxxd71xxx  on the expression of cytokines such as

interleukin 1 in skin tissue also should be considered
in this context.17
a second hypothesis is that  xxxd71xxx  may stimulate metabolism and buffering of cytokine-induced
increases in  xxxd3417xxx  by inducing increased cellular levels of crabp 2. this is consistent with studies in which systemic treatment with  xxxd71xxx  has
been shown to increase expression of crabp 2 in
the epidermis.18
a third hypothesis is that synthetic retinoids such
as  xxxd71xxx  may alter metabolism of endogenous
retinoids at the level of degradation. for example,
increased intracellular atra levels in psoriatic
lesions could theoretically result from a defective
cyp 26 enzyme, the activity of which may be modulated by synthetic retinoids.

nuclear receptor binding of
synthetic retinoids
pharmacologic activity of synthetic retinoids is
likely to be mediated through binding and activation
of nuclear receptors; these include alpha, beta, and
gamma subtypes of both the rar and rxr receptors.5 current research is aimed at identifying molecules that selectively bind and activate specific receptor subtypes. underlying this research is the expectation that each receptor subtype is tissue-specific and
mediates a set of unique biological functions, and
that use of subtype-selective retinoids will thus yield
therapeutic specificity. this strategy, however, has
several limitations. rars are known to form heterodimers with rxrs.5 the resulting heterodimers
have been shown to exert both specific and redundant functions in differentiation, proliferation, and
apoptosis. however, to date, none of these heterodimers have been demonstrated to exert a unique
function in skin. furthermore, the concentrations of
subtype-selective retinoids such as  xxxd3297xxx  (an

 xxxg1932xxx  and  xxxg1933xxx –specific ligand) achieved
in the skin after topical use are in the micromolar
range, levels associated with nonspecific binding.
 xxxd71xxx  has been shown to activate all 3 subtypes
of rar, despite the absence of measurable binding
to any of the subtypes in vitro (table ii).19 such data
indicating receptor activation without demonstrated
receptor binding represent another paradox regarding the mechanism of action of retinoids and underscore the need for further study on the interaction of
 xxxd71xxx  with nuclear receptors.
nuclear receptor crosstalk
topical vitamin d derivatives have proven effective in the treatment of psoriasis. like  xxxd3417xxx ,
thyroid hormone, and steroids,  xxxd408xxx  regulates a number of developmental and
physiological processes in vertebrates by binding to
a specific  xxxg2412xxx  (vdr) that functions as
a transcription factor. these ligand-dependent transcription factors constitute a superfamily of nuclear
receptors. upon ligand binding, nuclear receptors
bind to short, specific dna sequences called
response elements in the vicinity of target genes and
stimulate, or in some cases repress, transcription.
according to the current model, vdrs function as
heterodimers with the rxrs, which are also members of the nuclear receptor superfamily.5 it has also
been suggested that vdrs may form heterodimers
with rar. although in vivo interactions between
 xxxd3417xxx  and vitamin d signaling pathways need
further investigation, these molecular models suggest that retinoids and vitamin d derivatives may act
synergistically in the treatment of psoriasis possibly
through cooperative regulation of a single gene.20
some clinical observations suggest that the combination of calcipotriol and  xxxd71xxx  may be effective;
however, much work is still needed in this area.1

conclusion
retinoids are important therapeutic agents in the
treatment of psoriasis. their mechanism of action,
however, is still unknown. studies of possible mechanisms to date have suggested that synthetic
retinoids such as  xxxd71xxx  may act to modulate
changes in cellular retinoid metabolism induced by
cytokines such as ifn gamma, which has been implicated
in the disease process. further study is needed on
the function of  xxxd3417xxx  nuclear receptors,
including their activation by  xxxd71xxx  and interaction
with other nuclear receptors.
