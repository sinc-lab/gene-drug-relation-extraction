a streamlined and high-yielding synthesis of  xxxd203xxx  (1), a potent  xxxg2240xxx  (sp) receptor
antagonist, is described. the enantiopure oxazinone 16 starting material was synthesized via a
novel crystallization-induced dynamic resolution process. conversion of 16 to the penultimate
intermediate cis-sec xxxd2850xxx  9 features a highly stereoselective lewis acid-catalyzed trans acetalization of chiral alcohol 3 with trichloroacetimidate 18 followed by inversion of the adjacent chiral
center on the morpholine ring. the six-step process for the synthesis of 9 was accomplished in
extremely high overall yield (81%) and with only two isolations.
introduction
mammalian tachykinin  xxxg2240xxx  (sp) has been
associated with numerous inflammatory conditions, mediation of the emetic reflex, and modulation of central
nervous system (cns) disorders.1 antagonists of the
neurokinin-1 ( xxxg234xxx ) receptor to which sp preferentially
binds are potential therapeutic agents for the treatment
of chemotherapy-induced emesis, moderate to severe
major depression, anxiety, pain, asthma, arthritis, and
migraine.1  xxxd203xxx  (1) is a potent and orally active
antagonist of the human neurokinin-1 (hnk-1) receptor
currently in development at merck. to support the
ongoing clinical trials and eventual manufacturing, more
practical and less costly syntheses were strongly desired.
very recently, an alternative synthetic approach to 1 was
published.2 we would like to disclose our new synthesis
of  xxxd203xxx  (1).
structurally,  xxxd203xxx  (1) features three chiral centers, two of which are on its morpholine core. a triazolinone side chain is appended to the nitrogen via a

retrosynthetic analysis

methylene spacer. an obvious and logical retrosynthetic
approach to the target molecule was via a cis acetalization of the chiral alcohol 3 (scheme 1) via the activated
 xxxd2437xxx  2. however, this turned out to be exceedingly
challenging and problematic.
results and discussion
although stereochemical control of glycosylation has
been intensely investigated, a general cis glycosylation
method is still lacking.3 the synthesis of starting material oxazinone 5 (scheme 2) has been reported previously.4 it was reduced with dibalh, and the resulting
 xxxd2437xxx  intermediate was activated by formation of the
carbamate, carbonate, phosphorodiamidite, phosphate,
mesylate, and triflate (2a-f, respectively). the phosphate, mesylate, and triflate (2d-f, respectively) were

unstable for isolation and used in situ. unfortunately,
attempted cis acetalization of the chiral alcohol 35 with
the activated  xxxd2437xxx  2 yielded very little of the desired
isomer cis-6 upon treatment with various lewis acids.
the undesired trans-6 was invariably the major isomer.
elimination reaction was a major problem also. apparently, the reaction proceeded via the stabilized carbonium
intermediate to give the thermodynamically and kinetically more favored trans-6. when the lithium or potassium alkoxides of alcohol 3 were used as nucleophiles in
the absence of lewis acid, no trace of the desired product
was observed.
to circumvent this inherent preference for trans acetalization, we envisioned that if one starts from ent-5,
then a trans acetalization should establish the correct
stereochemistry at the anomeric center to give 7 (scheme
3). the other chiral center could then be inverted via a
cis hydrogenation of the imine intermediate 8 to afford
the desired cis-sec xxxd2850xxx  9.
however, the availability of the oxazinone ent-5 must
be addressed first. previously,4 5 was obtained via
resolution with 3-bromocamphor-8-sulfonic acid (bcsa).
but bcsa is expensive and limited in supply. r-methylbenzylamine, which is very inexpensive and equally
available in either enantiomeric form, appeared to be an
attractive chiral auxiliary. thus, reaction of (r)-(+)-rmethylbenzylamine with ethyl oxalyl chloride under
schotten-baumann conditions gave compound 10
(scheme 4). it could be reduced to the amino alcohol 146
directly with bh3‚thf or bh3‚dms. however, the reac(4) (a) alabaster, r. j.; gibson, a. w.; johnson, s. a.; edwards, j.

tion required elevated temperatures (60 °c), which raised
safety issues for large-scale use. additionally, the cost
was still relatively high. alternatively, the crude ester
10 was hydrolyzed in situ to the carboxylic acid 11, which
was then reduced at -10 °c by in situ-generated borane
from nabh4 and h2so4. in situ borane generation via
other combinations, including nabh4/i2, nabh4/bf3‚
et2o, nabh4/msoh, or nabh4/tfa gave similar results.
interestingly, two competing pathways were observed.
the major one was initial reduction of the amide giving
12, which was then smoothly reduced to the amino
alcohol 14. in the minor pathway, the carboxylic acid was
reduced first affording 13, but subsequent reduction of
the amide group became exceedingly slow. formation of
a five-membered ring borane complex is postulated to
interfere with the subsequent reduction. typically, the
amino alcohol 14 was obtained in 90% yield containing
∼10% 13. the crude product was used directly since 13
does not interfere in the next step.
the other fragment, 4-fluorophenylglyoxal hydrate 15,
was prepared from inexpensive 4-fluoroacetophenone by
treatment with aqueous hbr/dmso in ∼80% yield.7
simply heating a mixture of amino alcohol 14 and glyoxal
15 in the presence of acetic acid afforded oxazinone 16.8
however, the stereoselectivity was rather disappointing,
∼1:2 favoring the undesired (3s)-isomer. we also observed that the newly created chiral center was quite

labile under acidic conditions. this was fully explored to
achieve a crystallization-driven dynamic resolution process. since the free base 16 is an oil, crystallization of
its salt with  xxxd1526xxx , tfa, msoh, and hcl was screened,
but only its hcl salt crystallized. gratifyingly, when the
2/1 diastereomeric mixture of 16 was treated with hcl
in i-proac at 70 °c, the desired (3r)-isomer (minor)
crystallized preferentially and nearly all of the other
diastereomer was converted into the desired (3r)-isomer!
a simple filtration afforded the hcl salt of oxazinone 16
in 90% yield with excellent chemical and optical purity
(>98%).
oxazinone 16 was reduced to the  xxxd2437xxx  17 (trans/cis
) 8/1) with dibalh in a mixture of toluene and thf at
-20 °c (scheme 5). over-reduction to the diol became
significant (∼5-10%) at higher temperatures (0-5 °c).
 xxxd2437xxx  17 was not crystalline, so it was not purified but
directly activated by treatment with trichloroacetonitrile
and 1.0 equiv of k2co3 in toluene affording the trichloroacetimidate 18. since 18 is not very stable for storage,
it was used directly after filtering off the k2co3 and in
vacuo concentration to remove the excess trichloroacetonitrile.
among the lewis acids and solvents examined for the
acetalization, a combination of bf3‚et2o and toluene/
thf gave the best results. thus, treatment of 18 and
the chiral alcohol 3 with a catalytic amount of bf3‚et2o
in toluene/thf at between -30 and -20 °c afforded the
trans acetalization product 19 in ∼90% overall yield
(hplc assay) from the oxazinone 16 (three steps). the
trans/cis ratio was excellent (96/4) as determined by
hplc and 1h nmr. performing the reaction at -10 °c
resulted in about 5% lower yield, mainly due to elimination.  xxxd774xxx  turned out to be a nicely crystalline
solid, but its isolation by crystallization was hampered
by its rather high solubility in most organic solvents. on
the other hand, crystallization from ethanol/water proved
to be very successful. after the reaction was quenched
with aqueous na2co3, the organic layer was concentrated
to a low volume and flushed with ethanol. slow addition

of water completed the crystallization of 19. this isolation
protocol provided complete rejection of the trichloroacetamide byproduct as well as other colored impurities
with minimal loss of the product (<5%).  xxxd774xxx 
was isolated in 85-87% yield with consistently high
purity. the only detectable impurity was 1.5-2.5% of the
cis isomer.
the chiral auxiliary on 19 was easily cleaved by pd/
c-catalyzed hydrogenolysis in the presence of a strong
acid such as  xxxd1526xxx ‚h2o, hcl, or msoh yielding the
trans-sec xxxd2850xxx  20. acetic acid was not very effective and
resulted in incomplete conversion. compound 20 was
directly converted to the imine 8 by successive treatment
with ncs and dbu in a mixture of toluene/dmf at 0
°c-rt.9 the formation of the n-chloro intermediate 21
was almost instantaneous even at 0 °c, but the subsequent elimination reaction required 3 h at rt. when
triethylamine was used as the base, the elimination step
was much slower. the regioselectivity for the elimination
was superb, and the other regioisomer was not observed.
the crude solution of 8 was used directly for the
hydrogenation to give the desired cis-sec xxxd2850xxx  9. again
the stereoselectivity was excellent, and less than 1% of
the trans isomer was observed.  xxxd543xxx  was isolated
as its  xxxd1526xxx  or hcl salt in 95% yield from 19. the overall
yield for the six-step process from oxazinone 16 was a
remarkable 81% with an average yield of >96% per step.
the key intermediate 9 has been converted into the final
drug 1 by a simple alkylation with triazolinonyl chloride

conclusions
in summary, we have developed a streamlined and
high-yielding synthesis of the penultimate intermediate
9 for the synthesis of  xxxd203xxx , a potent sp receptor
antagonist. the key step was a highly stereoselective
lewis acid-catalyzed trans acetalization. additionally, we
have developed a new synthesis of optically pure oxazinone 16 utilizing an exceptionally efficient crystallization-driven epimerization/resolution process. this synthesis is easily scalable and cost-effective.
