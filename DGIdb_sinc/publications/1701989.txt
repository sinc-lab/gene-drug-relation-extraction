[inhibitory action  xxxd157xxx  on  xxxg1177xxx -induced enhancement of histamine releasability of human leukocytes].   xxxd157xxx , an anti-allergic drug, showed a concentration-dependent inhibition against hril-3-induced enhancement of in vitro histamine release from human leukocytes by anti-ige. the significant inhibitory action of  xxxd157xxx  was observed in one out of nine and six out of nine allergic subjects at concentrations of 10(-5) m and 10(-4) m, respectively. this means that the inhibitory effect of  xxxd157xxx  varied from patient to patient. post-treatment as well as simultaneous treatment with  xxxd157xxx  produced an inhibitory action on the enhancing effect of hril-3, suggesting that hril-3-induced enhancement of releasability is a reversible reaction. aa-861, oky-046, superoxide dismutase and  xxxd1903xxx  showed no effects on the hril-3-induced enhancement of histamine releasability. the inhibitory action of amlexamox to the hril-3-induced enhancement of histamine releasability may be a new anti-allergic mechanism, details of which remains unclear.
