up-regulation of spermidine/ xxxd3234xxx  n1-acetyltransferase (ssat) expression is a part of proliferative but not anabolic response of mouse kidney.  a differential expression pattern of spermidine/ xxxd3234xxx  n(1)-acetyltransferase (ssat), the enzyme critical to proper homeostasis of cellular polyamines, is reported in mouse kidney undergoing hyperplasia and hypertrophy. we have shown that ssat activity and ssat mrna are significantly induced by antifolate cb 3717 and folate that evoke a drug-injury-dependent hyperplasia. in contrast, ssat activity is down-regulated in the testosterone-induced hypertrophic kidney, while ssat mrna is positively controlled by this androgen. catecholamine depletion evoked by reserpine drastically decreases the folate-induced activity of  xxxd3156xxx  decarboxylase ( xxxg152xxx ), which limits polyamine biosynthesis, but has no effect on ssat activity augmented by cb 3717. our results document that the increased ssat expression solely accompanies the proliferative response of mouse kidney, and suggest the importance of post-transcriptional regulation to the control of ssat activity in both hyperplastic and hypertrophic experimental models.
