effect of imidazoline drugs on human blood platelet aggregation.  the effect of seven commonly used in therapy imidazoline derivatives on human blood platelet aggregation was studied. three of the agents, i.e. clonidine,  xxxd186xxx  and  xxxd3336xxx  were classified as partial agonists of the receptor responsible for aggregation. two other drugs, i.e.  xxxd2914xxx  and  xxxd3393xxx  act as competitive antagonists of relatively high receptor affinity. the remaining imidazolines:  xxxd3539xxx  and  xxxd2698xxx  effectively inhibit the platelet receptor in a non-competitive manner. the last two compounds seem to be selective alpha 2-adrenoceptor antagonists.
