biochem behav 64(1) 41–52, 1999.—the effects of (1)-5-oxo-d-prolinepiperidinamide monohydrate (ns-105) on the
scopolamine-, electrolytic lesion of the nucleus basalis magnocellularis (nbm)-, af64a-, baclofen-, cerebral ischemia- and
electroconvulsive shock (ecs)-induced memory disruption in the passive avoidance response or radial arm maze tasks were
investigated in rats. the effects of ns-105 were compared with those of  xxxd181xxx , bifemelane, idebenone, and indeloxazine
in two tasks of the passive avoidance response. furthermore, effects of ns-105 on in vivo release of acetylcholine (ach) in
the cerebral cortex, high-affinity choline uptake (hacu) of the cerebral cortex in rats with lesion of nbm, hacu of the
hippocampus in rats treated with pentobarbital and activity of  xxxg440xxx  (chat) of the cerebral cortex in rats
with lesion of nbm were examined. ns-105 showed antiamnestic actions in a variety of animal models of cholinergic dysfunction employed in this study.  xxxd181xxx  improved memory disruption caused by scopolamine, but bifemelane, idebenone, and indeloxazine did not. ns-105 (10 mg/kg) showed the increase of ach release from the cerebral cortex and the
enhancement of hacu both in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus, but showed no change in activity of chat. ns-105
also reversed memory disruption induced by baclofen, a potent  xxxg828xxx  agonist, but all of reference drugs did not.
these results suggest that antiamnestic action of ns-105 is due to the facilitation of cholinergic neuronal activity and the suppression of  xxxg828xxx -mediated responses. © 1999 elsevier science inc.

brain ischemia

cholinergic dysfunction in the central nerve system has
been implicated in the pathophysiology of senile dementia
(45). biochemical evidence has shown that ns-105 stimulates
central cholinergic activity: this compound reversed the decrease in high-affinity choline uptake (hacu), both in the
cerebral cortex after electrolytic lesion of the nucleus basalis
magnocellularis (nbm) and in the hippocampus after pentobarbital anesthesia in rats. besides the cholinergic mechanism, central gabaergic systems have been reported to participate in the process of learning and memory (8,9,46).
baclofen, a potent  xxxg828xxx  agonist (7), has been reported to interfere with memory consolidation or retention in

rodents (9,46) as well as humans, particularly when it was
given in combination with anticholinergic drugs (42). biochemical evidence has shown that repeated administration of
ns-105 increases the number of gabab receptors implicating the upregulation mechanism, but shows no affinity for
gabab receptors in the rat cerebral cortex without affecting binding properties for b-adrenergic and 5-hydroxytryptamine2 receptors (44).
to further clarify the possible roles of acetylcholine (ach)
and  xxxg828xxx -mediated responses in the antiamnestic
actions of ns-105, we examined and compared the effects of

method

animals
in all experiments, 5–13-week-old male wistar rats (japan
slc inc., hamamatsu, japan; charles river japan inc.,
yokohama, japan) were used. rats were housed in a group of
five, with free access to food (clea japan inc., tokyo, japan),
and water in an air-conditioned room maintained at 21–258c,
with a relative humidity of 45–65% and a 12 l:12 d cycle
(lights automatically on at 0800 h). experiments were carried
out in accordance with the guideline for the care and use of
laboratory animals written by the japanese pharmacological society.
chemicals and drugs
chemicals used in the present experiments were as follows: ns-105 [(1) 5-oxo-d-prolinepiperidinamide monohydrate],  xxxd181xxx , bifemelane hydrochloride, idebenone, indeloxazine hydrochloride, and af64a were synthesized in
our laboratories. the following chemicals and drugs were obtained from commercial sources: scopolamine hydrochloride,
 xxxd2940xxx , ach chloride, and tetraphenyl boron (sigma chemical, st. louis, mo); (6) baclofen (funakoshi, tokyo);  xxxd2609xxx  (sm-400, shin-etsu chemical,
tokyo); pentobarbital sodium (abbott, chicago, il); isopropylhomocholine chloride (eicom, kyoto, japan); sodium-1decanesulfonate (tokyo kasei kogyo, tokyo);  xxxd3337xxx  chloride, choline chloride, and tdta-2na (nacalai tesque, kyoto); [methyl-3h] choline chloride (2.96
gbq/mol, amersham, uk); soluene (soluene-350, packard
instrument, downers gove, il); ampicillin sodium-cloxacillin
sodium ( xxxd165xxx -s, meiji seika, tokyo).
af64a, the aziridinium specie of af64, was formed by
dissolving af64 (as the picrate salt) in physiological saline
and adjusting the ph to 7.4 with solid nahco3. this solution
was allowed to stand at room temperature for at least 60 min
before injection into animals to achieve maximal conversion
of the mustard analog to the aziridinium form. af64a obtained in this manner was used (13). ns-105 and reference
drugs were dissolved or suspended in an appropriate volume
of 0.5%  xxxd2609xxx  in physiological saline and administered orally in a volume of 5 ml/kg. scopolamine, pentobarbital, and baclofen were dissolved in physiological saline and
injected intraperitoneally.
experiment i: effect of ns-105 on scopolamine-induced
memory disruption of a passive avoidance response
the passive avoidance response of rats was examined in
the step-down type situation, as previously described (10).
briefly, 5-week-old rats were first trained to remain on a rubber platform (15 3 15 3 0.5 cm) placed at a corner of the
skinner box (25 3 30 3 33 cm) that was equipped with an
electrifiable grid floor. when the rats were moved away from
the safety zone, they were exposed to continuous electroshocks (0.8 ma) from the grid floor. the training session
of a passive avoidance response was composed of five consecutive trials. each trial was carried out every 1 min. the normal
reaction of naive animals was to jump back onto the platform

at the first and/or second trial. all rats used never stepped
down onto the grid floor after third trial, and learned not to
step down onto the grid floor until the final trial of training
session. however, 10% of these control animals showed lack
of accurate response in the retention test. ns-105 was administered orally 1 h before the training (acquisition) session of a
passive avoidance response. scopolamine (0.3 mg/kg) was injected ip 30 min prior to the training session. the retention
test was carried out 24 h after training session. in the retention test, the latent period of step-down onto the grid floor
was measured up to 180 s.
experiment ii: effects of ns-105 and reference drugs on
scopolamine-induced memory disruption of a passive
avoidance response
the passive avoidance response of rats were examined in
the step-through type situation, as previously described (1).
briefly, on the day 1, 5-week-old rats were adapted for 5 min
to the apparatus that consisted of a dark compartment
equipped with an electrifiable grid floor and an illuminated
plexiglas compartment. the two compartments were separated by a solenoid-operated guillotine door. on day 2, the
adaptation was followed by a single acquisition trial in which
animals were placed in the illuminated compartment, and after 30 s delay, allowed to enter the dark compartment by raising the guillotine door. when the rat moved completely into
the dark compartment, the door was closed, and it received a
foot shock (1.3 ma) for 3 s through the grid floor, delivered
by an electric generator. immediately after receiving the
shock, the rat was removed from the dark compartment and
returned to its home cage. the retention test was carried out
24 h after receiving the shock (acquisition trial). it was produced in a manner similar to the acquisition trial, except that
the guillotine door did not close when the rat entered the
dark compartment and the shock was not applied to the grid
floor. the time spent (latency time) without moving into the
dark compartment after raising the guillotine door was measured. during the retention test, rats were provided access to
the dark compartment for 300 s. ns-105,  xxxd181xxx , bifemelane, idebenone, and indeloxazine were administered orally
1, 2, 2, 0.5, and 1 h before the acquisition trial, respectively.
experiment iii: effect of ns-105 on nbm lesion-induced
memory disruption of a passive avoidance response
eight- to 9-week-old rats were anesthetized with pentobarbital (50 mg/kg, ip) and fixed on a stereotaxic apparatus.
bilateral electrolytic lesions were made by passing an anodal
dc current (1.5 ma, 25 s) through the uninsulated tip (0.5
mm) of a platinum electrode inserted stereotaxically into the
nbm (1.2 mm posterior to bregma, 2.6 mm lateral to midline,
6.5 mm below dura matter), according to the atlas of könig
and klippel (29). the circuit was completed by attaching a
cathode to the wound edge. in the sham-operated rats, the tip
of an electrode was inserted 1 mm above the lesion site without delivery of current. after the operation,  xxxd165xxx -s (50
mg/kg), an antibiotic was injected im.
ns-105 was administered orally 1 h before the training session of a passive avoidance response using a step-down type
task as described in experiment i, which was conducted 14
days after the nbm lesion. the retention test was carried out
24 h after the training session. all animals used in the retention test stepped down onto the grid floor after third trial of
five consecutive training trials. the latent period of stepdown onto the grid floor was measured up to 180 s.

ns-105 improves learning and memory in rats
at the end of the experiment, all rats with an nbm lesion
were anesthetized with pentobarbital (50 mg/kg, ip) and were
perfused with 30 ml of physiological saline followed by 50 ml
of 10% formalin through the left cardiac ventricle. the brain
was removed and kept in 10% formalin for at least 7 days,
and serial 50 mm-thick coronal brain sections were made and
stained with cresyl violet to verify the location of the lesioned
areas. in the case of incomplete lesions of the bilateral nbm,
data from the animal were excluded from the experiments.
experiment iv: effect of ns-105 on af64a-induced memory
disruption of a radial arm maze
ten-week-old rat were anesthetized with pentobarbital
(50 mg/kg, ip) and fixed on a stereotaxic apparatus. a sagittal
incision was made in the scalp, and two holes were drilled
through the skull for placement of the infusion cannulae into
the lateral cerebral ventricle (0.7 mm posterior to bregma, 1.6
mm lateral to midline, 4.0 mm below dura matter), according
to the atlas of könig and klippel (29). rats were bilaterally
infused with 2.5 nmol of a cholinergic neurotoxic agent,
af64a (i.e., 5 nmol per brain) or physiological saline using
an injection cannulae. a total volume of 2.5 ml of solution was
infused into each lateral ventricle at a rate of 0.5 ml/min. the
injection cannulae was left in place for 2 min after injection to
allow for diffusion of the solution into the cerebrospinal fluid.
the cannula was then removed, and the scalp was sutured.
three weeks later, training of the radial arm maze task was
started. throughout the training, rats were individually
housed with free access to water, but were deprived food and
maintained at 80% of free-feeding body weight.
training of the radial arm maze task was carried out according to the method of olton et al. (38), with slight modifications. after adapting to the experimental apparatus, the rat
received one training trial per day for 14 days. a piece of
cheese (25 to 30 mg) as a reward was placed in each food well,
and the rat was allowed to choose between them freely for 10
min after the start of the trial. when the rat entered the unselected arm and ate the reward, this selection was considered
as a correct choice, while if the rat reentered a previously selected arm, this selection was defined as an error choice. ns105 was administered orally 1 h before every training trial.
experiment v: effects of ns-105 and reference drugs on
baclofen-induced memory disruption of a passive
avoidance response
the passive avoidance response of 5-week-old rats was examined in the step-through type situation as described in experiment ii. the latent period to enter the dark compartment was
measured up to 300 s. ns-105,  xxxd181xxx , bifemelane, idebenone, and indeloxazine were administered orally 40, 120, 120,
30, and 60 min before the acquisition trial, respectively. baclofen
(8 mg/kg) was administered ip 10 min before the acquisition trial.
experiment vi: effect of ns-105 on cerebral
ischemia-induced memory disruption of a
passive avoidance response
the passive avoidance response of 10-week-old rats were
examined in the step-through type situation as well as the
method of experiment ii. the transient forebrain ischemia
was induced by four-vessel occlusion (41,43). briefly, rats
were anesthetized with pentobarbital (50 mg/kg, ip), and the
vertebral arteries were permanently occluded by electrocautery at the first cervical vertebra. twenty-four hours later, the

43

training session of a passive avoidance response was carried
out. ns-105 was administered orally 1 h before the training
session. immediately after the training session, common carotid arteries were occluded for a 5-min period by small, temporary clips (sugita aneurysm clip, mizuho ikakogyo, tokyo).
after that, the clips were removed, free flow through common
carotid arteries was ascertained by microscopic examination,
and wounds were closed. animals were returned to their
cages. the retention test of a passive avoidance response was
carried out 24 h after training session.
experiment vii: effect of ns-105 on cerebral
ischemia-induced memory disruption of a
radial arm maze
the transient forebrain ischemia was induced by four-vessel
occlusion (41,43). briefly, 10-week-old rats were anesthetized
with pentobarbital (50 mg/kg, ip), and the vertebral arteries
were permanently occluded by electrocautery at the first cervical
vertebra. on the next day, common carotid arteries were occluded for a 15-min period by the identical method for experiment vi. the sham-operated rats were subjected to no occlusion
of the vertebral arteries and common carotid arteries. three
weeks later, training of the radial arm maze task as previously
described was started with slight modifications. throughout the
training periods, rats were individually housed with free access to
water, but were food deprived and maintained at 80% of freefeeding body weight. in this task, a 10-s delay was imposed between consumption of first four and second four rewards. each
rat was underwent two trials (1 session) per day for 14 days. ns105 was administered orally 1 h before daily session. from the
total number of choices until rats ate four rewards after a 10-s interval delay in the two trials, the ability of acquisition was judged.
experiment viii: effect of ns-105 on ecs-induced memory
disruption of a passive avoidance response
the passive avoidance response of rats were examined in
the step-down type situation. briefly, 5-week-old rats were
trained according to the method of experiment i. immediately
after the training session, the rats received ecs (45 ma, 2 s)
through the ears and were subsequently administered orally
with ns-105. three hours later, their retention test of a passive avoidance response was carried out. the latent periods of
step-down onto the grid floor were measured up to 180 s.
experiment ix: effect of ns-105 on the extracellular
concentration of ach in the cerebral cortex of
conscious and freely moving rats
intracerebral microdialysis. the experiment was performed,
as described previously (26). briefly, 10–12-week-old rats
were anesthetized with pentobarbital (50 mg/kg, ip) and
placed on a stereotaxic apparatus (narishige scientific instrument, tokyo). the skull was exposed, and a burr hole was
bored to implant a stainless steel guide cannulae. the stereotaxic coordinates for the frontal cortex were 3.0 mm lateral
and 3.7 mm anterior to bregma, and 4.0 mm below the surface
of dura mater, according to the atlas of paxinos and watson
(39). the guide cannulae was fixed to the skull using dental
cement and anchor screw, and a dummy cannulae was inserted into the guide cannulae. the dummy cannulae was replaced by a microdialysis prove 24 h after surgery. the microdialysis probe used in the present experiment was i-shaped
with 3-mm long cellulose membrane tubing (bdp-i-4-03,
eicom, kyoto, japan), the lower tip of which was placed 3

mm below the end of the guide cannulae after insertion. molecular weight cutoff value of the cellulose membrane was approximately 50,000 dalton. ringer’s solution containing 5 mm
neostigmine was then perfused at a flow rate of 2 ml/min, using a microinfusion pump (cma/100, carnegie medicine,
stockholm, sweden). microdialysates were collected every 20
min into polyethylene microtubes containing an appropriate
amount of isopropylhomocholine as the internal standard, 3 h
after start of perfusion. at the end of experiment, brains were
perfused with 50 ml of 10% formalin-physiological saline solution via carotid artery, and serial 50-mm thick of coronal
sections were made and stained with cresyl violet to verify the
location of the tip of the dialysis probe.
determination of ach. ach concentration in microdialysates was determined by hplc with electrochemical detection, according to the method of damsma et al. (11) with
modifications (26). briefly, the hplc system was composed
of a pump (l-6200, hitachi, tokyo) equipped with a degassor
(dg-100, eicom), damper (pl-100, eicom), sample injector with a 100-ml sampling loop (model 7125, rheodyne,
ca), column system, electrochemical detector (lc-4b, bas,
osaka, japan) fitted with a flow cell unit (cb-100, eicom)
with a platinum working electrode, the potential of which
was set at 0.45 v vs. an ag/agcl reference electrode and a recorder (chromatopac c-r4a, shimazu, kyoto). the column
system consisted of a guard column (5.0 3 4.0 mm inside diameter) packed with 5c18 silica resin (ac-ods, eicom), a
reversed-phase separation column (ac-gel; 150 3 6.0 mm
inside diameter, eicom), and an enzyme reactor column
containing covalently bound acetylcholinesterase and choline
oxidase (ac-enzympak; 5.0 3 4.0 mm inside diameter). the
column temperature was 348c. the mobile phase was 0.1 m
sodium phosphate buffer (ph 8.5) containing 0.82 mm sodium-1-decanesulfonate, 0.59 mm  xxxd3337xxx 
chloride and 10 mm disodium ethylenediamine tetraacetate.
the flow rate was 1.0 ml/min. the amount of ach was calculated from the ratio of the peak height of ach to that of isopropylhomocholine.
experiment x: effect of ns-105 on the reduction of the
hacu of synaptosomes from the cerebral cortex in
nbm-lesioned rats
nine-week-old rats were used. nbm lesion of rats were
carried out as well as the method of experiment iii. ns-105
was administered orally 1 h before sacrifice by decapitation.
measurement of hacu was carried out according to the
method of haga and noda (21). brains were quickly removed
and dissected into the cerebral cortex and other tissues. the
cerebral cortex was weighed and homogenized in 10 vol of
ice-cold 0.32 m sucrose with a teflon glass homogenizer. the
homogenate was centrifuged at 1000 3 g for 10 min, the pellet
discarded and the supernatant recentrifuged at 17,500 3 g for
20 min to obtain a crude mitochondrial pellet. the resultant
pellet was resuspended in the original volume of 0.32 m sucrose, and was then utilized in uptake studies. aliquots (100 ml;
0.25–0.5 mg of protein) were added in 1.9 ml of a krebs–
ringer phosphate buffer in polyethylene tubes. [methyl3h]choline chloride (80.0 ci/mmol) was added to the tubes to
obtain a final concentration of 0.5 mm equivalent to 0.4 mci
per sample. the krebs–ringer phosphate buffer had the following composition expressed in mm: nacl 126, kcl 4.8,
cacl2 1.3, na2hpo4 15.8, mgcl2 1.4, d-glucose 11.1, ph 7.4.
samples were incubated for 10 min at 308c. the incubation
was terminated by adding 50 ml of 0.4 mm choline, and the

ogasawara et al.
tubes were transferred to an ice bath. the particulate fraction
in each sample was collected by centrifugation at 9000 3 g for
15 min. the remaining medium was aspirated and the pellets
were surface washed twice with 3 ml of saline. after removing
the saline, the pellets were digested by adding 0.5 ml of soluene. after digestion was completed, the soluene mixture was
transferred to vials containing 10 ml of scintillator fluid and
the radioactivity was counted using a liquid scintillation
counter (packard tri-carb model 460/4640).
experiment xi: effect of ns-105 on the reduction of the
hacu of synaptosomes from the hippocampus in
pentobarbital-treated rats
nine-week-old rats were used. fifteen minutes after ns105 administration (ip), pentobarbital at a dose of 50 mg/kg
was given ip. thirty minutes later, animals were sacrificed by
decapitation. then brains were quickly removed and dissected into the hippocampus and other tissues. the hippocampus were weighed, and experimental procedures and
measurement of hacu were examined as well as the method
of experiment xi.
experiment xii: effect of ns-105 on the reduction of
cholineacetyltransferase (chat) activity of the
cerebral cortex in nbm-lesioned rats
ten- to 13-week-old rats were used. nbm lesion of rats
were carried out as well as the method of experiment iii. ns105 was administered orally 1 h before sacrifice by decapitation. measurement of chat was carried out according to the
method of fonnum (17). brains were quickly removed and
dissected into the cerebral cortex and other tissues. the cerebral cortex was frozen at 2808c. on the day of the measurement of chat activity, the frozen tissue was thawed and
weighed, and homogenized in 20 vol of ice-cold tris-phosphate buffer (ph 7.4) obtained 0.5% triton x-100 and 10 mm
edta for 30 s with a polytoron homogenizer. the homogenate with the incubation mixture was incubated for 20 min at

results are shown in fig. 10. in conscious and freely moving rats, the basal ach release from the cerebral cortex measured in the present experiment was almost constant at least
for 3 h, and the value was 2.1–2.6 pmol/20 min. ns-105 (10
mg/kg) significantly increased ach release from the cerebral

fig. 11. effect of ns-105 on the reduction of the hacu of synaptosomes from the cerebral cortex in nbm-lesioned rats. electrical
lesion of bilateral nbm was made, and 2 weeks later the experiment
on hacu was conducted. animals were sacrificed 1 h after oral
administration of ns-105 and synaptosomes were prepared from the
cerebral cortex. each value represents the mean 6 se of five to nine
experiments. numbers of experiments are shown in parentheses. significantly different from control; ## p , 0.01 vs. (sham 1 mc); * p ,

in the present experiments, ns-105 reversed memory disruption of passive avoidance response or radial arm maze
tasks caused by scopolamine (2,10,19,35), or by nbm lesion
(3,5,14,16,34), or by af64a (22,31,32), or by ecs (12,20,30),
which produce dysfunction or hypoactivity of the cerebral
cholinergic system. ns-105, at doses of 3 to 30 mg/kg, reversed memory disruption induced by scopolamine or nbm
lesion. furthermore, ns-105 (30 mg/kg) reversed memory
disruption of the radial arm maze caused by cerebral ischemia, which produces disruption of the cholinergic system
(27,28). in the present biochemical experiments, the ach release measured in the cerebral cortex of conscious and freely
moving rats is assumed to depend mostly on the cholinergic
neuronal activity. ns-105 produced a significant elevation of
ach release at a dose of 30 mg/kg that reversed memory deficits caused by the dysfunction of central cholinergic neurons.
in this study, ns-105 stimulated the central cholinergic activity: this compound reversed the decrease in the hacu, both
in the cerebral cortex after an electrolytic lesion of nbm and
in the hippocampus after pentobarbital anesthesia in rats

without affecting chat activity in the cerebral cortex after the
nbm lesion. therefore, it is suggested that ns-105 stimulates
the central cholinergic neurons, which may contribute to its antiamnestic actions. a reference drug of ns-105,  xxxd181xxx , also
reversed scopolamine-induced memory disruption of a par,
but bifemelane, idebenone, and indeloxazine did not. the antiamnestic effect of  xxxd181xxx  has been reported to due to the
enhancement of cholinergic neurons in the hippocampus (18).
besides cholinergic mechanisms, central gabaergic systems have been reported to participate in the process of
learning and memory (8,9,46). baclofen, a potent gabab agonist (7), has been demonstrated to interfere with memory
consolidation or retention in rodents (9,46) as well as in humans, particularly when it was given in combination with anticholinergic drugs (42). gabab receptors are negatively coupled with adenylate cyclase via pertussis toxin-sensitive gtpbinding proteins (4, 47, 49). several lines of evidence have shown
that intracellular cycle amp signal transduction pathway is
involved in the processes of learning and memory: stimulation
of postsynaptic  xxxd1773xxx  pathway facilitates learning and
memory (33). recently, wu et al. (50) have reported in type i
adenylate cyclase mutant mice that these animals show an impairment of spatial memory in the morris water maze task. in
addition, long-term potentiation (ltp) is perturbed in the
hippocampal cal subfield of the mutant mice (50). it has also
been demonstrated that the postsynaptic a kinase pathway is
important for the induction of ltp (6,15,23,48). therefore,
the inhibition of adenylate cyclase activity may contribute to
the baclofen-induced learning and memory disruption. in the

present experiment, ns-105 produced a marked reversal of
the impairment of a passive avoidance response induced by
baclofen. in our recent biochemical study, ns-105 antagonizes baclofen-induced inhibition of adenylate cyclase activity
in slices of the rat cerebral cortex (36). therefore, the behavioral antibaclofen action of ns-105 observed in the present
experiment may result, at least in part, from the reversal of
suppressive action of baclofen on the intracellular secondmessenger systems such as  xxxd1773xxx  production. however,
it is unlikely that the biochemical antibaclofen action of ns-105 is
mediated by the blockade of gabab receptors, because this
compound has negligible affinity for gabab receptors labeled with [3h]gaba in the presence of isoguvacine, a
gabaa receptor ligand (36). we have also found that ns-105
stimulates metabotropic glutamate receptors (mglurs) to
modulate adenylate cyclase activity in membranes of the rat
cerebral cortex as well as in primary cultured neurons of fetal
mouse cerebral cortex (36,37). moreover, an mglurs agonist
(1s,3r)-1-aminocyclopentane-1,3- xxxd2537xxx  similarly
reverses baclofen-induced inhibition of adenylate cyclase activity (36). taken together, it is suggested that ns-105 may
block baclofen response by stimulating mglurs in neurons
where crosstalk between mglurs and gabab receptors exists.
on the other hand,  xxxd181xxx , bifemelane, idebenone,
and indeloxazine produced no reversal of the impairment of a
passive avoidance response induced by baclofen in this study.
isaacson and nicoll (24) reported that  xxxd181xxx , a drug to
enhance glutamate responses (25), reduces  xxxg981xxx  desensitization.  xxxd181xxx  may facilitate  xxxg981xxx  transmission directly (40). however, it is not reported that
 xxxd181xxx  affects the  xxxg828xxx -mediated responses.
gabab receptors have been considered to be implicated
in the pathophysiology of depressive illness. we evaluated the
antidepressant activity of ns-105 in the forced swim and
learned helplessness in rats (44). orally administered ns-105
(1–100 mg/kg) significantly decreased immobility time in
forced swimming, an effect being comparable to that of desipramine. repeated administration of ns-105 also reversed
escape failure in the shuttle-box test in rats with prior exposure to inescapable footshock. biochemical data showed that
repeated administration of ns-105 increased the number of
gabab receptors in the rat cerebral cortex without affecting
properties for b-adrenergic and 5-hydroxytryptamine2 receptors (44). in contrast to other antidepressants, ns-105 did not
inhibit monoamine uptake in vitro, nor did it change monoamine concentrations in brain tissues or extracellular fluids
(unpublished data). these findings suggest that ns-105 has potent antidepressant activity, in which upregulation of gabab
receptors after repeated administration may be involved.
in conclusion, antiamnestic action of ns-105 may be due
to the facilitation of the cholinergic system and the suppression of  xxxg828xxx -mediated responses. furthermore,
repeated treatment with ns-105 shows antidepressant effects
induced by upregulation of gabab receptors. ns-105, therefore, is a promising drug for clinical use in ameliorating the
cognitive impairment in patients with senile dementia of the
alzheimer’s and/or cerebrovascular types.
