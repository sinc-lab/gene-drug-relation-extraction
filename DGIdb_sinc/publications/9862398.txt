the µ opioid irreversible antagonist beta-funaltrexamine
differentiates the discriminative stimulus effects of opioids
with high and low efficacy at the µ opioid receptor
received: 19 august 1997 / final version: 28 march 1998

abstract the purpose of the present study was to determine the relative intrinsic efficacy of various opioids using the irreversible µ opioid antagonist beta-funaltrexamine (betafna). to this end, pigeons were trained to discriminate 3.0 (n=6) or 1.8 (n=1) mg/kg morphine from distilled water in a two-key, food-reinforced, drug discrimination procedure. the µ opioids fentanyl, l-methadone,
buprenorphine, butorphanol, nalorphine, nalbuphine and
 xxxd2464xxx , as well as the delta opioid bw373u86, substituted completely for the morphine stimulus. the stimulus
effects of morphine were antagonized (i.e., produced a
significant increase in the ed50 value) by a 10 mg/kg but
not a 5 mg/kg dose of betafna. antagonist effects of betafna
were observed following a 2-h pretreatment, but not following 26-, 50-, 74-, 98- or 146-h pretreatments. the
stimulus effects produced by fentanyl, l-methadone and
buprenorphine were not antagonized by doses of betafna
as high as 20, 10 and 10 mg/kg, respectively. the lowest
dose of betafna required to antagonize the stimulus effects
of butorphanol was 10 mg/kg, whereas the effects of nalorphine, nalbuphine and  xxxd2464xxx  were antagonized
by a dose of betafna as low as 5 mg/kg. the delta opioid
bw373u86 substituted for the morphine stimulus, and
this effect was not antagonized by 10 mg/kg betafna. the
pkb values for naloxone (1.0 mg/kg) against the stimulus
effects of fentanyl (6.70) and morphine (6.52) were considerably higher than that for bw373u86 (4.60), indicating further that the morphine-like stimulus effects produced by bw373u86 were not mediated by activity at
the µ opioid receptor. these findings indicate that the

strategy of irreversible antagonism can be used effectively to differentiate opioids with varying degrees of intrinsic efficacy at the µ opioid receptor in a pigeon drug discrimination procedure. in particular, the ranking of these
drugs by relative intrinsic efficacy at the µ opioid receptor is: l-methadone=fentanyl≥buprenorphine≥morphine≥
butorphanol>nalorphine=nalbuphine= xxxd2464xxx . additionally, the short-acting effect of betafna in the pigeon
suggests that the recovery of µ opioid receptor function
varies across species.

introduction
the concept of intrinsic efficacy, which essentially reflects the ability of a drug to activate a receptor once
bound to it, encompasses three common assumptions
regarding receptor pharmacology: (1) a given drug effect is proportional to receptor occupancy, such that as
occupation increases, the magnitude of the effect increases, (2) drugs can typically produce their maximal
effects by occupying only a proportion of the available
receptor population, and (3) the maximal effects produced by a drug can vary across assays (mjanger and
yaksh 1991; kenakin 1993). in drug discrimination
procedures, the relative intrinsic efficacy of opioids has
been determined by examining their patterns of substitution and antagonism (shannon and holtzman 1977;
france and woods 1985; picker et al. 1992, 1993;
young et al. 1992). for example, in animals trained to
discriminate either a low or a high dose of the µ opioids
morphine or fentanyl from saline, opioids with high efficacy at the µ opioid receptor substitute completely for
the stimulus effects of both training doses. in contrast,
opioids with lower efficacy produce complete substitution for the training drug in the low training dose group,
but fail to substitute for, and in fact, antagonize the effects of the training drug in the high training dose group.

21

thus, in the high-dose group, these drugs bind to but
are unable to activate enough receptors to produce effects on their own, and thus competitively block the
effects of higher efficacy opioids (e.g., shannon and
holtzman 1979; colpaert and janssen 1984; koek and
woods 1989; young et al. 1992; picker et al. 1993).
similarly, in morphine-dependent pigeons trained to
discriminate between a high training dose of morphine,
naltrexone and saline, higher efficacy opioids substitute
for the morphine stimulus, whereas lower efficacy opioids substitute for the naltrexone stimulus. moreover,
only relatively high efficacy opioids reverse the naltrexone-appropriate responding evoked by morphine
abstinence (france and woods 1990).
since chronic administration of a drug appears functionally to decrease the population of receptors through
which the drug interacts, this technique can also be useful in a drug discrimination procedure to rank opioids on
the basis of their relative intrinsic efficacy. following
chronic administration of morphine, for example, the
dose-effect curves of low efficacy opioids are shifted to
the right and/or downward to a greater extent than the
dose-effect curves of higher efficacy opioids (young et
al. 1991; paronis and holtzman 1994).
irreversible antagonists also can be used in vivo to
rank order drugs on the basis of their relative efficacies,
and this approach has proven useful in assays of antinociception (e.g. zimmerman et al. 1987; adams et al.
1990; mjanger and yaksh 1991; zernig et al. 1994,
1995), self-administration (e.g. zernig et al. 1997) and
schedule-controlled responding (e.g. butelman et al.
1996; pitts et al. 1996). irreversible antagonists bind to
the receptor in such a way as to make them non-functional, effectively limiting the number of receptors with
which a drug can interact. in these situations, drugs first
decrease in potency and then effectiveness, with the
changes in potency and effectiveness being greater for
lower than higher efficacy compounds (see kenakin
1993).
numerous studies have demonstrated that betafna is an
irreversible antagonist at the µ opioid receptor (see takemori and portoghese 1985; martin et al. 1993). betafna
covalently labels µ opioid receptors in several species,
including bovine, guinea pig, rat and mouse striatal
membranes (liu-chen et al. 1993). furthermore, this
binding could be inhibited by naloxone or µ opioids, but
not by delta or kappa opioids, suggesting high specificity (liuchen and philips 1987). the purpose of the present
study was to determine the relative intrinsic efficacy of
selected opioids that are active at the µ opioid receptor
using betafna. to this end, the dose-effect curves for the
opioids fentanyl, l-methadone, morphine, buprenorphine,
butorphanol, nalbuphine, nalorphine and  xxxd2464xxx 
were determined in the absence and then presence of one
or more doses of betafna in pigeons trained to discriminate morphine from saline. a relatively low dose of morphine was used to establish the discrimination to insure
that these opioids produce complete substitution (young
et al. 1992).

materials and methods
subjects
seven experimentally naive, female, white carneau pigeons maintained at approximately 80–85% of their free-feeding body weights
were used. each pigeon was singly housed in a climate controlled
colony on a 12-h light/dark cycle, with free access to grit and water.
apparatus
seven operant conditioning chambers were used. each chamber
contained two operative, 2.5 cm diameter, illuminated response
keys which were 23 cm from the bottom of the chamber. three seconds access to grain was available through an aperture that centered
below the keys approximately 8 cm from the floor, and was illuminated by a 7-w bulb when the hopper was raised. the chambers
also contained a white light for ambient illumination, an exhaust fan
for ventilation, and white noise to mask extraneous sounds. data
were collected with a microcomputer using software and interfacing
supplied by med associates inc. (georgia, vt., usa).
drug discrimination training
after key-pecking was established, food delivery became contingent upon a single response (fixed ratio 1; fr1). the ratio size required for food delivery was increased over several sessions until
an fr20 was in effect. at this time the training dose of morphine
(3.0 mg/kg for six pigeons, 1.8 mg/kg for one pigeon) or distilled
water was administered before each session. for four pigeons,
food delivery was contingent upon responding on the right key after drug administration and on the left key after distilled water administration. the contingencies were reversed for the other three
pigeons. during these initial training sessions, the pretreatment
time and session length were 15 min and the ratio size was increased to 30 (i.e., fr30). after discriminative control was established, a multiple trial training procedure was initiated. these sessions were one to five components in length, with each component
consisting of a 10-min time-out followed by a 6-min response period. at the beginning of the time-out period, either distilled water
or the training dose of morphine was administered. after the timeout period, the house light and key lights were illuminated and responding on the injection-appropriate key was reinforced. these
sessions consisted of zero to four distilled water components followed by zero to two morphine components. during sessions in
which the second to last component was preceded by administration of the training dose of morphine, either distilled water administration or a sham injection preceded the last component, and at
the end of this trial the session was terminated. training sessions
were typically conducted 5 days per week.
drug discrimination testing
once stimulus control was established, testing began. test sessions were conducted only if the percentage of injection-appropriate responses before the first reinforcer was greater than 80% on
the preceding 2 training days. during test sessions, the completion
of the fr30 on either key resulted in food delivery. using a cumulative dosing procedure, increasing doses of the test drug were administered at the beginning of each time-out such that the total
dose administered increased by 0.25 or 0.5 log units. in tests with
naloxone, the dose of naloxone was administered immediately
preceding the first test drug dose. in tests with betafna (except for
the time-course studies), the dose of betafna was administered 2 h
before the first component of the test session. after betafna administration, dose-effect curves of all drugs were determined 2 h, 50 h,
and 146 h later. with morphine and nalbuphine, additional tests
were conducted (“time-course tests”) in which 10 mg/kg betafna
was administered 26 h before determination of the first dose-effect

curve, with the dose-effect curve then redetermined after 74 and
98 h. during these testing periods, training sessions were not held
on the intervening days. generally, at least 2 weeks intervened between betafna administrations. to ensure that the dose-effect curves
did not change as a function of repeated testing, multiple dose-effect curves were obtained throughout the experiment for fentanyl
(n=2 determinations), morphine (n=3), and nalbuphine (n=2). in
these cases, mean data were determined for an individual animal,
and these means were averaged to produce the group dose-effect
curve displayed.
data analysis
the percentage of responses on the drug-appropriate key before delivery of the first reinforcer was calculated for each drug and drug
dose. this measure was displayed as a function of dose of the drug.
ed50 values and 95% confidence limits were determined using loglinear interpolation from at least 3 points on the ascending limb of
the dose-effect curve. data from individual animals were used to
determine ed50 values. dose ratios were calculated by dividing a
drug’s ed50 following administration of betafna by its ed50 in the
absence of betafna. rightward shifts in the dose-effect curve were
considered significant if there was no overlap in the 95% confidence limits of the ed50 values. tests were also conducted on the
slope of the dose-effect curve determined for a drug alone and in
combination with betafna (procedure 11; tallarida and murray
1987). with the exceptions of 10 mg/kg betafna in combination with
butorphanol and nalorphine, betafna failed to alter the slopes of the
dose-effect functions. in tests with naloxone, pkb values were determined using the following formula: pkb=–log [b/(dr–1)],
where b is the molecular weight of the antagonist and dr is the
dose ratio (i.e., ed50 after naloxone/ed50 before naloxone).

and 10 mg/kg betafna. when administered alone, morphine
produced dose-dependent increases in drug-appropriate
responding with complete substitution (≥80% drug-appropriate responding) obtained at doses of 1.0 and 3.0 mg/kg.
following pretreatments at 2, 50 and 146 h, a dose of
5 mg/kg betafna failed to alter the morphine dose-effect
curve. as shown in table 1, this dose of betafna did not
significantly alter morphine’s ed50. the stimulus effects
of morphine were antagonized by a 2-h pretreatment of
10 mg/kg betafna, as indicated by a 4.5-fold rightward shift
in the dose-effect curve and a significant increase in the
ed50 value. by 26 h after betafna administration and at all
other time points examined, the dose-effect curve of morphine remained at control levels. when administered
alone and in combination with betafna, morphine did not
markedly alter rates of responding (data not shown).

buprenorphine dose-effect curve to the right in a dosedependent manner, based on changes in ed50 values,
these shifts were not statistically significant (table 1).
the lack of statistical significance was partially due to
large degrees of individual differences in sensitivity to
betafna’s effects. that is, some animals were not affected
by betafna, whereas others failed to respond on the drugappropriate key when tested with the highest doses of
buprenorphine. when administered alone or in combination with betafna, buprenorphine failed to significantly alter response rates (data not shown).

l-methadone produced dose-dependent increases in drugappropriate responding with complete substitution obtained at the highest doses tested. the dose-effect curves
for both fentanyl and l-methadone were not altered by
doses as high as 20 and 10 mg/kg betafna, respectively
(see also table 1). fentanyl and l-methadone, alone or in
combination with betafna, did not markedly alter rates of
responding (data not shown).
buprenorphine
figure 2 also shows the effects of buprenorphine alone
and in combination with betafna, administered 2 h before
determination of the dose-effect curve. when administered alone, buprenorphine substituted completely for the
morphine stimulus. although betafna appeared to shift the

butorphanol, nalorphine and  xxxd2464xxx 
figure 2 shows the effects of butorphanol, nalorphine
and  xxxd2464xxx  alone and following a 2-h pretreatment
with selected doses of betafna. butorphanol produced
dose-dependent increases in drug-appropriate responding with complete substitution obtained at the highest
dose tested. the lowest dose of betafna tested, 5 mg/kg,
did not significantly alter butorphanol’s ed 50 (table 1).
the 10 mg/kg dose of betafna produced a 10-fold increase in ed50 values, and decreased the slope of the
dose-effect curve. even at the highest dose of butorphanol tested (0.3 mg/kg), complete substitution for the
morphine stimulus was not obtained.
nalorphine produced dose-dependent increases in
drug-appropriate responding, with complete substitution at
0.3 mg/kg. the lowest dose of betafna tested (2.5 mg/kg)
did not antagonize the effects of nalorphine, whereas the 5
and 10 mg/kg doses decreased nalorphine’s potency such
that there was a 3.3- and 7.6-fold increase in ed50 values,
respectively (table 1). when combined with 10 mg/kg
betafna, the slope of nalorphine’s dose-effect curve decreased, such that 3.0 mg/kg nalorphine failed to substitute completely.

like the other opioids tested,  xxxd2464xxx  substituted completely for the morphine stimulus. whereas a
2.5 mg/kg dose of betafna failed to alter the  xxxd2464xxx 
dose-effect curve, doses of 5.0 and 10 mg/kg betafna
shifted the  xxxd2464xxx  dose-effect curve 6.5 and 22fold to the right, respectively (table 1).
when administered alone and in combination with
betafna, butorphanol, nalorphine and  xxxd2464xxx  did not
produce marked decreases in rates of responding (data
not shown).
nalbuphine
figure 3 shows the effects of nalbuphine administered
alone and after several doses of betafna given at pretreatment times ranging from 2 to 146 h. when administered
alone, nalbuphine substituted completely for the morphine
stimulus. although the nalbuphine dose-effect curve was
not altered by the 2.5 mg/kg dose of betafna, the 5.0 and
10 mg/kg betafna doses shifted the nalbuphine dose-effect
curve 7.8 and 17-fold to the right, respectively. when a
dose of 20 mg/kg betafna was administered 2 h prior to
nalbuphine, the dose-effect curve was shifted to the right.
an ed50 value could not be determined, but the magnitude of this rightward shift appeared comparable to that
obtained following administration of 10 mg/kg betafna.
twenty-six hours after administration of 10 mg/kg betafna,
and by 50 h after administration of the other doses of
betafna, the nalbuphine dose-effect curve returned to control levels. nalbuphine did not produce marked effects on
rates of responding when administered alone or in combination with betafna (data not shown).
bw373u86
as shown in fig. 4, bw373u86 substituted completely
for the morphine stimulus, and the bw373u86 dose-effect curve was not altered by a 10 mg/kg dose of betafna.
figure 4 also shows that a 1.0 mg/kg dose of naloxone
produced a 2.7-fold parallel, rightward shift in the
bw373u86 dose-effect curve (table 2), yielding a pkb
value for naloxone of 4.6 (±1.26, sem). this rightward
shift was considerably smaller than the 14- and 16-fold
parallel, rightward shifts obtained when 1.0 mg/kg naloxone was combined with morphine and fentanyl, respectively (table 2). against the stimulus effects of mor-

phine and fentanyl, the pkb values for naloxone were
6.52 (±0.29) and 6.7 (±0.29), respectively. bw373u86
alone or in combination with betafna did not produce
marked effects on rates of responding. when combined
with naloxone, bw373u86 produced a dose-dependent
decrease in response rate, with the highest doses markedly decreasing rates of responding (data not shown).

discussion
in the present study, l-methadone, fentanyl, morphine,
buprenorphine, butorphanol, nalorphine, nalbuphine and
 xxxd2464xxx  substituted completely for the morphine
stimulus, a finding in accord with numerous studies
demonstrating that these drugs produce µ opioid-like
stimulus effects (e.g., shannon and holtzman 1977;
young et al. 1992; picker et al. 1993; morgan and picker
1996). although these opioids produced similar substitution patterns, their relative intrinsic efficacy at the µ opioid receptor could be differentiated on the basis of their
sensitivity to antagonism by the irreversible antagonist
betafna. in particular, the stimulus effects of nalbuphine,
nalorphine and  xxxd2464xxx  were antagonized by a dose
of betafna as low as 5 mg/kg, whereas the stimulus effects
of morphine and butorphanol were antagonized by a
dose as low as 10 mg/kg. in contrast to these findings,
betafna failed to antagonize the stimulus effects of fentanyl and l-methadone even when tested up to doses as
high as 20 and 10 mg/kg, respectively. the stimulus effects of buprenorphine were not significantly antagonized by 5 or 10 mg/kg betafna, a possible consequence
of large individual differences across animals in sensitivity to betafna. these findings suggest that the ranking of
these drugs by relative intrinsic efficacy at the µ opioid
receptor is: l-methadone=fentanyl≥buprenorphine≥morphine≥butorphanol>nalorphine=nalbuphine= xxxd2464xxx .
this rank order closely parallels those obtained in various in vitro studies (e.g. emmerson et al. 1996) and
many in vivo studies (see below) using other methods to
determine intrinsic efficacy, suggesting that the in vivo
use of betafna is a useful tool for determining relative intrinsic efficacy.
the finding that betafna antagonized the stimulus effects of morphine is consistent with those reported previously in subjects trained to discriminate morphine
from saline (france and woods 1987; suzuki et al. 1995;
holtzman 1997). of particular interest was that in pigeons

26

trained with a 10 mg/kg dose of morphine, a 10 mg/kg
dose of betafna shifted the morphine dose-effect curve to
the right and downward (france and woods 1987). in
contrast, a 3.0 mg/kg dose of morphine was used to established the discrimination in the present study, and the
10 mg/kg dose of betafna produced only a 4.5-fold rightward shift in the morphine dose-effect curve. one possible consequence of increasing the training dose of a µ
opioid is functionally to increase the relative efficacy
requirement of the task (e.g. young et al. 1992; picker et
al. 1993; reviewed in young 1991). if these changes in
training dose were altering the efficacy requirement, the
effectiveness of betafna should also be altered. in particular, increasing the efficacy requirement should increase
the effectiveness of betafna and vice versa. this suggestion is supported by findings in pigeons trained to discriminate  xxxd1864xxx , a µ opioid with lower efficacy than
morphine, from saline, where 10 mg/kg betafna failed to
antagonize the stimulus effects of morphine and produced an approximately 10-fold shift in the nalbuphine
dose-effect curve (picker 1997), as opposed to the 4.5and 17-fold shifts observed in the present study.
in the present study, the stimulus effects of fentanyl
and l-methadone were not antagonized by betafna, a finding in accord with these drugs having higher efficacy at
the µ opioid receptor than morphine as measured in various in vivo (e.g. brase 1986; paronis and holtzman
1992; duttaroy and yoburn 1995) and in vitro (e.g. magnan et al. 1982; ivarsson and neil 1989) preparations.
because it has been demonstrated that the stimulus effects produced by fentanyl and l-methadone are mediated by activity at the µ opioid receptor (shannon and holtzman 1976; picker et al. 1993), it appears that betafna
tested failed to alkylate a sufficient number of receptors
to produce a change in the drug’s potency. this is in contrast to a recent finding by holtzman (1997) in which
rats were trained to discriminate morphine from saline,
and 10 µg betafna administered intracisternally shifted the
fentanyl dose-effect curve 2.3-fold to the right. one possibility is that the efficacy requirement in the present
procedure is lower than in the holtzman study (1997),
resulting in betafna being less effective. this is supported
by the finding that nalbuphine and  xxxd2464xxx  do not
substitute completely for the morphine training stimulus
used in the holtzman study (e.g., shannon and holtzman
1977), suggesting a higher efficacy requirement than the
present discrimination. other possibilities include potential species differences, differences due to the route of
drug administration, or length of pretreatment period.
buprenorphine and butorphanol substitute for high and
low training doses of fentanyl and morphine (negus et al.
1990; picker et al. 1993). however, there is ample evidence from drug discrimination (e.g., schaefer and holtzman 1981; france and woods 1990) and antinociception
(dykstra et al. 1993; butelman et al. 1995; walker et al.
1995; morgan and picker 1996) studies to suggest that
these opioids have a slightly lower degree of intrinsic efficacy than morphine. in the present study, 10 mg/kg but
not 5 mg/kg betafna shifted the butorphanol dose-effect

curve to the right. the degree of antagonism observed
with butorphanol (10-fold) was larger than that observed
with morphine (4.5-fold) suggesting that butorphanol has
slightly lower efficacy than morphine. in contrast to butorphanol, betafna pretreatment failed to alter buprenorphine’s ed50 values in a statistically significant manner.
in a previous study, betafna shifted the buprenorphine
dose-effect curve to the right further than morphine (6.5fold versus 4.9-fold) (holtzman 1997). the reasons for
these differences are not readily apparent, but may be due
partially to the considerable inter-animal variability observed in the present study.
in the present study, the stimulus effects of these drugs
were antagonized by 5 mg/kg betafna, a dose lower than
that required to antagonize the stimulus effects of morphine, butorphanol or buprenorphine, suggesting lower intrinsic efficacy at the µ opioid receptor. this conclusion is
consistent with findings from numerous studies which
suggest that nalorphine, nalbuphine and  xxxd2464xxx  have
lower intrinsic efficacy at the µ opioid receptor than morphine, as well as butorphanol and buprenorphine (france
and woods 1985, 1990; zimmerman et al. 1987; dykstra
1990; young et al. 1992; picker et al. 1992, 1993; morgan
and picker 1996). taken together, these studies suggest
that nalorphine, nalbuphine and  xxxd2464xxx  have lower
efficacy than morphine, and that the larger shifts in the
dose-effect curves after betafna administration observed in
the present study reflect this lower efficacy.
one potential application of irreversible antagonists
such as betafna is to quantify the degree of receptor inactivation through the use of various analytical methods
(e.g. furchgott 1966; black and leff 1983; zernig et al.
1997). one requirement of these analyses is that the
maximal effect produced by the agonist and the slope of
the dose-effect curve decrease (i.e., flattening of the
dose-effect curve) after irreversible antagonist administration. in the present study, neither the slopes of the
dose-effect curves nor the maximal effects produced
were substantially altered (with very few exceptions);
therefore, these analyses could not be conducted. even
though the slopes were not altered, the fact that there
was a differential degree of antagonism across agonists
suggests betafna is acting as an “irreversible” antagonist,
rather than a “competitive” antagonist.
a time course analysis of betafna’s effects against the
stimulus effects of morphine and nalbuphine indicated
that there was a substantial degree of antagonism 2 h after administration, and when tested at 26 h the dose-effect curves for these drugs were at control levels, regardless of the initial degree of antagonism. in other studies
using pigeons, antagonism of the effects of µ opioids was
observed  xxxd1891xxx  min and at 2.5 h after betafna administration (france and woods 1987; mattox et al. 1994). these
pretreatment times differ considerably from the 24 or 48
h (or longer) pretreatment times used in studies with rats,
squirrel monkeys and rhesus monkeys (gmerek and
woods 1985; zimmerman et al. 1987; adams et al.
1990; mjanger and yaksh 1991; suzuki et al. 1995; pitts
et al. 1996; holtzman 1997). for example in rats, the

27

rate-decreasing effects of butorphanol were antagonized
by betafna 24 h through 18 days after administration and
failed to return to control levels until 36 days after administration (pitts et al. 1996). similarly, betafna decreased the total number of µ opioid receptors in rats for
at least 18 days and antagonized the reinforcing effects
of heroin for 10 days (martin et al. 1995). if the time it
takes until the return to control levels reflects the rate at
which new µ opioid receptors are generated (zernig et al.
1994, 1996), it would appear that there exist profound
differences across species in the rate at which new µ opioid receptors are generated after alkylation.
it is possible that the administration of an opioid agonist 2 h after betafna may result in a situation where the
agonist protects the receptors from alkylation by betafna
(e.g., sanchez-blazquez and garzon 1989; paronis et al.
1993), thereby lessening betafna’s effects. the time
course studies show that the morphine and nalbuphine
dose-effect curves were at control levels 26 h after
betafna pretreatment, with no intervening agonist treatment. this suggests that betafna has a very short duration
of action in the pigeon compared to other species.
the delta opioid bw373u86 substituted for the morphine
stimulus, and this effect was not reversible by betafna. the
finding that the pkb value for naloxone as an antagonist of
the effects of bw373u86 was lower than those for naloxone against the morphine and fentanyl stimulus is more
consistent with a delta than a µ opioid-receptor mediated action. thus, these results extend previous findings demonstrating that delta opioids can produce µ opioid-like stimulus
effects through a non-µ and presumably delta opioid mechanism (negus et al. 1996; picker et al. 1996; picker 1997).
taken together, these findings suggest that irreversible antagonists can be used as tools to group or rank
drugs by their intrinsic efficacy in a drug discrimination
procedure. this ranking was obtained by examining the
patterns of antagonism by betafna, where differential
shifts in the dose-effect curves for the various opioids
were used to infer differences in intrinsic efficacy. furthermore, the results from this study are consistent with
a number of others examining the effects of these drugs
in various species across many different behavioral and
physiological procedures.
