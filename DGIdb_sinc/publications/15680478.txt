abstract
leptin presents an important role in energy balance and neuroendocrine control in mammals. in an attempt to identify regions of the leptin
molecule responsible for its bioactivity, we have synthesized six peptides based on the protein three-dimensional structure. fragments were
synthesized by the solid-phase methodology, purified by reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (rp-hplc), and
characterized by liquid chromatography–electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (lc/esi-ms). they were injected intravenously and their
ability to induce fos immunoreactivity (fos-ir) in rat hypothalamus was compared with that of the recombinant human leptin and saline.
fragment ac-[ser117]lep116–140–nh2 (v) induced fos-ir in hypothalamic nuclei that express  xxxg1320xxx  long form. no similar ability was
observed for the other five fragments. to investigate whether fos-ir was induced in the same neuronal group activated by leptin, we proceeded
with a dual-label immunohistochemistry for cocaine- and  xxxd163xxx -regulated transcript ( xxxg339xxx ), a neuropeptide related to leptin action in
rat hypothalamus. we found that ac-[ser117]lep116–140–nh2 (v) differentially activates  xxxg339xxx  neurons through the rostrocaudal extension of
the arcuate nucleus. these results suggest that this fragment acts in the same group of neurons that mediate leptin response. this approach
may offer the basis for the development of leptin-related compounds, having potential application in human or veterinary medicine.

1. introduction
obesity is a disorder characterized by increased adipose
tissue mass as a result of systemic imbalance between
energy intake and expenditure. energy balance in mammals
ought to be controlled by a feedback loop in which the
amount of stored energy is sensed by the hypothalamus,
which in turn adjusts food intake [1] and energy expenditure
to maintain a constant body weight [2,3]. the protein
hormone produced by the ob-gene [4,5] and denominated
leptin [6], a product originating from adipose tissues [7,8],
circulates in the plasma and affects energy balance by
interacting with the hypothalamus [9]. leptin plays an

important role in the regulation of a variety of physiological
functions [10], including food intake [11,12], body temperature, and body weight maintenance [13–15]. total absence
or resistance to leptin causes morbid obesity [8], diabetes,
and hypogonadism [16].
the tertiary structure of the leptin molecule [17,18]
reveals the existence of a four-helix bundle that is characteristic of short-helix cytokines. in fact, leptin receptors belong
to the class i cytokine receptor family, densely expressed in
the hypothalamus, particularly in the arcuate, dorsomedial,
and ventromedial nuclei [19]. currently, a variety of studies
have shown that the weight-reducing effects of leptin are
likely mediated by its interaction with specific receptors
located mainly in these areas.
in the last years, different groups reported their attempts
to identify bioactive leptin fragments. while samson et al.
[20] found that the n-terminal leptin fragment (obgrp 22–

124

v.x. oliveira jr. et al. / regulatory peptides 127 (2005) 123–132

56) inhibited food intake after central administration in adult
male rats, rozhavskaya-arena et al. [21] showed that a
short peptide denominated ob3 (ser116–cys–ser–leu–pro–
gln121–thr) and some of its analogues reduced food and
water consumption in c57bl/6j ob/ob mice.
based on these results and on the tridimensional structure
of leptin [17,18], we have recently studied the following six
leptin-related peptides: ac-lep23–47–nh2 (i), ac-lep48–71–
nh2 (ii), ac-lep72–88–nh2 (iii), ac-lep92—115—nh2
(iv), ac-[ser117]lep116–140–nh2 (v), and ac-lep141–164–
nh2 (vi). i, iii, iv, and vi encompass fragments of the
native protein that present an a-helical structure. ii and v
cover the loops of the molecule. herein, we report the
design, synthesis, chemical characterization, and neuronal
responses found for these fragments in comparison to that
expected for the whole protein. this comparison was made
by using the expression of fos immunoreactivity (fos-ir), a
marker for cellular activation following intravenous administration of leptin [22,23]. therefore, we attempted to
investigate fragments’ ability to activate hypothalamic
neurons mediating leptin functions in the rat brain.

2. materials and methods
2.1. peptide synthesis, purification and chemical
characterization
all leptin-derived peptide fragments (table 1) were
synthesized manually using common protocols for solidphase methodology and t-boc strategy [24]. mbha resins
with substitutions with degrees varying from 0.4 to 0.8
meq/g were used [25]. the following side chain-protected
boc amino acids were obtained from bachem (torrance,
ca): arg(tos), asp(ochex), glu(ochex), his(tos), lys(2cl-z), ser(bzl), thr(bzl), thr(for), and tyr(2-cl-bzl). all
reagents and solvents were of analytical grade and used
from freshly opened container without any further purification. the na-terminal protections were removed with tfa
50% in dcm in the presence of 2% anisole for 20 min.
couplings were carried out using 2.5 excess of dic in

dcm–dmf (1:1, vol/vol). both steps were monitored by
kaiser ninhydrin test [26]. boc-asn and boc-gln were
coupled using 1.5-fold excess of dic-hobt [27] (1:1). bochis (tos). dcha incorporation employed a 1.5-fold excess
of bop [28] in the presence of excess of diisopropylethylamine (diea). coupling times were 1–2 h. recouplings of
1 h were done when needed using 2.5 excess tbtu in the
presence of excess diea in dcm–nmp (1:1, vol/vol).
when required, acetylations were performed with acetic
anhydride 50% in dcm for 15 min. the dry protected
peptidyl resins were exposed to anhydrous hf in the
presence of 10% anisole or edt at 0 8c for 1.5 h. excess
of hf and scavenger were eliminated under high vacuum.
the crude peptides were precipitated with anhydrous diethyl
ether, separated by filtration, extracted from the resin with
50% acetic acid in h2o, and lyophilized. the crude
lyophilized peptides were purified in two steps by preparative reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography
(rp-hplc) on a waters associates system (model prep
4000), using linear gradients (slope 0.33% b/min). briefly,
they were loaded on a vydac c18 preparative rp-hplc
column (25250 mm, 15 am particle size, 300 2 pore size)
at a flow rate of 7.0 ml/min and eluted with solvent a
(teap, ph 2.25) and solvent b (25%/teap, ph 2.25/
ch3cn), detection at 220 nm. selected fractions were
collected and converted to the tfa salt by loading on a
preparative column as mentioned above and eluted using
solvents a (0.1% tfa/h2o) and b [0.1% tfa in ch3cn/
h2o (75:25)] at a flow rate of 7.0 ml/min. selected fractions
containing the purified peptide were pooled and lyophilized.
the purified peptides were characterized, as shown in table
2, by rp-hplc and liquid chromatography–electrospray
ionization mass spectrometry (lc/esi-ms). rp-hplc was
performed on a waters associated system using a linear
gradient of 5–95% b for 30 min of ch3cn in two aqueous
buffers: teap, ph 2.25, and 0.1% tfa, at 1.5 ml/min, a
vydac c18 column (4.6150 mm, 5 am particle size, 300 2
pore size) at 215 nm. the lc/esi-ms data were obtained
on a micromass instrument, model zmd coupled on a
waters alliance model 2690 system using a waters novapak c18 column (2.2150 mm, 3.5 am particle size, 60 2
pore size); solvents a (0.1% tfa/h2o) and b [0.1% tfa in
ch3cn/h2o (75:25)]; gradient: 5–95% b for 30 min; k
range: 190–300 nm; and mass range: 500–3930 m/z.
2.2. animals
sixty-two normal adult male albino rats (wistar) weighing 240–280 g were housed one per cage in our institutional
animal care facility and allowed to adapt at least 7 days prior
to the onset of experiments. animals were maintained on a
12-h light/dark cycle, in a temperature-controlled environment (21f2 8c), with free access to water and food. all
experiments were carried out in accordance with the guidelines of the national institutes of health guide for the care
and use of laboratory animals (1996) and the institutional

2.3. venous catheterization and leptin administration
the method employed for catheter placement was
performed as described previously [29]. briefly, rats were
anesthesized with ketamine–xylasine solution, and a polyethylene catheter containing saline (pyrogen-free saline;
sigma) was inserted in the femoral vein and sutured in
place. the catheter was exteriorized between the scapulae
and plugged with a sterile stainless wire. following surgical
recovery, the animals were handled daily (5–7 days)
between 10:00 and 11:00 a.m. to minimize stress during
the experimental procedure. rats received recombinant
human leptin [1 mg/kg; national hormone and peptide
program—national institute of diabetes and digestive and
kidney diseases (nhpp–niddk), sigma] or different
doses of the synthetic leptin fragments, followed by a flush
of saline, or saline alone. the total volume injected in each
animal was 0.25 ml. rats were perfused 2 h after the
treatment. the animals were grouped by treatment. in fact,
six animals received 1 mg/kg recombinant human leptin
from nhpp–niddk and three animals received the same
dose of recombinant human leptin from sigma. as control,
nine animals were injected with saline. another group of
animals was treated with peptides i–vi (n=18) or saline
(n=17). following data analysis and according to the
current literature [20,21,30], we performed another set of
experiments using ac-lep23–47–nh2 (i) and ac-[ser117]
lep116–140–nh2 (v) in higher doses (5 mg/kg, n=6) or
saline (n=3).
2.4. animal perfusion and histology
following 2 h of fragments, leptin, and saline administration, animals were deeply anesthesized with a lethal

125

dose of 35% chloral hydrate (1 ml, i.p.) and perfused via
the ascending aorta with cold 0.9% saline (100 ml)
followed by 4% formaldehyde fixative, ph 9.5, 4 8c over
25 min. immediately after perfusion, brains were removed
from the skull and postfixed in the same fixative for 3–4
h. next, brains were cryoprotected overnight at 4 8c in
0.02 m potassium phosphate-buffered saline (kpbs)
containing 20% sucrose. series of coronal sections were
cut on a freezing microtome at 30 am (five series).
sections were stored at 20 8c in buffered antifreeze
solution.
2.5. immunohistochemistry
the immunohistochemistry protocol used was modified
from previous studies [22,23]. each step was preceded by
kpbs rinses. the sections were pretreated with 0.3%
 xxxd2298xxx  (sigma) for 30 min followed by a
blocking step with 3% normal goat serum (vector) for 1 h,
both diluted in kpbs and 0.25% triton x-100. the
sections were incubated in rabbit primary antiserum ( xxxd1664xxx , oncogene; 1:20.000 diluted in the blocking solution)
overnight at room temperature with gentle agitation. then
the sections were incubated in biotinylated goat antirabbit
igg (vector; 1:1000 in kpbs and 0.25% triton x-100) and
avidin–biotin complex (abc; vector elite kit, 1:500 in
pbs) both for 1 h at room temperature. after rinsing,
sections were incubated in 0.04% diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride (dab; sigma), 0.02% nickel sulfate (fisher
scientific), and 0.01%  xxxd2298xxx  dissolved in
kpbs. the reaction was interrupted with successive rinses
in kpbs. sections were mounted onto gelatin-coated slides,
dried in 37 8c oven overnight, dehydrated in alcohol,
cleared in xylenes, and coverslipped with dpx (sigma).
controls for the specificity of the antisera were described
previously [31]. adjacent series were stained with thionin
(nissl method) as reference.
2.6. dual-label immunohistochemistry
dual-label immunohistochemistry procedure was performed as reported in previous studies [23,31]. initially,
we performed an immunohistochemistry for fos detection
as described above. then the tissue was reexposed to
0.3%  xxxd2298xxx , rinsed in kpbs, and incubated
in blocking solution containing 2% normal donkey serum
(jackson laboratories) in kpbs and triton x-100 for 1 h.
next, sections were incubated in cocaine- and  xxxd163xxx -regulated transcript ( xxxg339xxx ) primary antisera
(1:20.000; phoenix) overnight at room temperature. the
tissue was incubated in biotinylated donkey antirabbit
(jackson laboratories) and abc, both for 1 h, and
submitted to peroxidase reaction using only dab as
chromogen. this procedure yields a brown cytoplasmatic
reaction product contrasting with black nuclear fos
staining.

2.7. data analysis and production of photomicrographs
sections were analyzed qualitatively with a leica
dmr light microscope. the hypothalamic nuclei that
showed differences in fos-ir after leptin and synthetic
fragments administration were compared to the control
animals for quantification. neurons expressing fos,
 xxxg339xxx , and both were counted by using a constant area
and scale grid position under a 10 objective. the
position of the counting grid within each brain region was
delineated through adjacent landmarks. the differences
between treatments groups in each region were compared
by using student’s t test (unpaired). in the statistical
analyses ( pn0.05), hypothalamic sections of animals that
received human leptin and ac-[ser117]lep116–140–nh2 (v)
(1 and 5 mg/kg) with the respective controls (saline) were
compared.
photomicrographs were produced by capturing images
with a digital camera (spot) and an apple macintosh power
pc computer. image editing software (photoshop) was used
to combine photomicrographs into plates. only the contrast
and brightness were adjusted.

3. results
3.1. peptide synthesis, purification and chemical
characterization
peptide syntheses, accomplished by the manual solidphase method using the t-boc strategy, were straightforward. however, we found a few difficulties in driving some
couplings to completion. improvement of couplings and
qualities of the crude peptides was observed when the
mbha resin employed the presented small substitution
degree (0.4 mmol/g; data not shown).
the two-step purification using different solvent systems
(tfa and teap) was very effective. the final peptides
showed purities above 97% by analytical rp-hplc. data
found in lc/esi-ms analysis are in agreement with the
expected molecular weights (table 2).
3.2. distribution of fos-ir
the distribution of fos-ir in rat brain following intravenous administration of murine leptin is very well
characterized [22,23,31]. based on such paradigm, we
have investigated the ability of specific leptin-related
peptides (fragments i–vi; 1 mg/kg) to induce fos-ir in
related hypothalamic nuclei. the results were compared
with those obtained with animals that received saline and
human leptin.
3.2.1. animals treated with saline
we observed a limited pattern of fos-ir in the
hypothalamus of rats that received saline. a moderate

amount of fos-ir in the suprachiasmatic nucleus, paraventricular nucleus, anterior hypothalamic area, and posterior hypothalamus was found (data not shown). induction
of fos-ir observed in saline-treated animals is likely due to
their manipulation during the experimental procedures
since similar patterns of fos-ir were also found in these
sites in animals that received leptin and the synthetic
fragments.
3.2.2. animals treated with recombinant human leptin
animals that received recombinant human leptin (1 mg/
kg) demonstrated a similar pattern of fos-ir compared to the
animals that were treated with murine leptin as described
previously [22,23].
we compared the responses of human leptin from the
nhpp–niddk with the human leptin from sigma and
observed a similar distribution of fos-ir in hypothalamic
nuclei. induction of fos-ir in the retrochiasmatic area
(rca), arcuate nucleus (arc), dorsomedial subdivision of
the ventromedial nucleus (dmvmh), caudal part of the
dorsomedial nucleus (cdmh) (fig. 1a–d), and ventral

premammillary nucleus of the hypothalamus (pmv) was
observed. fig. 2a shows the number of fos-ir cells counted
in comparison to control animals that received saline. we
also observed an increase in fos-ir in the paraventricular
nucleus of the hypothalamus (pvh), but the data did not
reach statistical significance compared to the control
animals (data not shown).
3.2.3. animals treated with leptin fragments
animals that received peptides i, ii, iii, iv, and vi
showed induction of fos-ir similar to the saline-treated
animals (data not shown). in fact, we found a moderate
amount of fos-ir in the suprachiasmatic nucleus, pvh,
anterior hypothalamic area, and posterior hypothalamus. no
consistent induction of fos-ir was observed in hypothalamic
nuclei expressing fos after human leptin treatment.
however, following ac-[ser117]lep116–140–nh2 (v)
administration, we found induction of fos-ir in hypothalamic nuclei related to leptin responses, including the
rca, arc, dmh, and pmv (figs. 2b and 3). although
we have found an apparent increase in fos-ir in dmvmh

and pvh, it did not reach significance compared to the
control animals.
as the leptin fragments, ac-lep23–47–nh2 (i) and ac[ser117]lep116–140–nh2 (v), correspond to the peptides
proposed by samson et al. [20] and grasso et al. [30],
respectively, as being active in reducing food intake, we
decided to direct our attention to them. thus, we performed
another set of experiments using the same paradigm and
higher doses of both fragments, ac-lep23–47–nh2 (i) and
ac-[ser117]lep116–140–nh2 (v) (5 mg/kg). we found no
consistent induction of fos-ir in hypothalamic-related nuclei
following intravenous administration of ac-lep23–47–nh2
(i). higher doses of ac-[ser117]lep116–140–nh2 (v) induced
the same pattern of fos-ir as compared to lower doses
(figs. 1e–f, 2c, and 3). moreover, we did not observe
significant differences in the amount of activated neurons
following the different doses (figs. 2b and c, and 3). in
fact, we observed increased fos-ir in the dmvmh of one
animal that received higher doses of ac-[ser117]lep116–140–
nh2 (v), but the results were not statistically different from
the control.
3.3. ac-[ser117]lep116–140–nh2 (v) induces fos-ir in arc
neurons expressing  xxxg339xxx 
in order to investigate whether ac-[ser117]lep116–140–
nh2 (v) induces fos-ir in the same neuronal population
responsive to leptin, we performed an experiment using
dual-label immunohistochemistry for fos and  xxxg339xxx , a
neuropeptide related to the protein function [31,32]. in
animals that received ac-[ser117]lep116–140–nh2 (v) (5
mg/kg), we observed fos-ir in  xxxg339xxx  neurons located
throughout the rostrocaudal extension of the rca and arc
(table 3, fig. 4). we found that the rca and the rostral
extension of the arc contain the highest proportion of duallabeled neurons (25% and 22%, respectively) compared to
the total  xxxg339xxx  cells. contrastingly, arc caudal levels
contained the lowest amount of  xxxg339xxx  neurons expressing
fos-ir (table 3). we also found few dual-labeled neurons in
the pvh and dmh (data not shown). in addition, we

4. discussion
the use of synthetic peptide fragments to identify leptinlike agonists has been explored in the last few years [10].
this kind of approach takes into consideration that the
activation of  xxxg1320xxx  long form may not be required
for certain biological activities, such as energy and glucose
homeostasis [33], and that short peptides could bypass more
easily the blood–brain barrier. grasso et al. [30,34]
suggested that the c-terminal region of the molecule,
corresponding to amino acid residues 116–130, reduces
body weight gain and food intake in ob/ob mice. the same
peptide was tested in male rats and was shown to be able to
stimulate prolactin and  xxxd2226xxx   xxxd2520xxx  secretion when
administrated intracerebroventricularly [35]. two even
shorter fragments (ser116–cys–ser–leu–pro–gln121–thr,
denoted ob3, and its analogue, d-leu4-ob3) were also
described to induce weight reduction when administered to
female c57bl/6j ob/ob mice [21]. on the other hand,
samson et al. [20] hypothesized that the satiety effects of

130

v.x. oliveira jr. et al. / regulatory peptides 127 (2005) 123–132

leptin reside in the n-terminal region of the protein
sequence. they described that a significant inhibition of
food intake was observed following intracerebroventricular
administration of the fragment corresponding to amino acid
residues 22–56, named obgrp 22–56.
recently, the effects of human leptin fragment (126–140)
[36] on spontaneous secretion of pituitary hormones and
endogenous leptin, as well as on  xxxg891xxx   xxxg892xxx -induced gh
secretion, were examined in eight healthy, nonobese men.
the author proposed that human leptin fragment (126–140)
has an inhibitory role in gh secretion, since the exogenous
administration of this fragment significantly suppressed
spontaneous  xxxg891xxx   xxxg892xxx -induced gh secretion in a dose–
response manner.
because of these conflicting observations related to the
location of the bioactive regions of leptin molecule, we
decided to perform a screening of the whole protein by
using peptide fragments selected on the basis of its threedimensional structure. leptin secondary structures disclosed
from crystallography [17] and nuclear magnetic resonance
(nmr) [18] analyses present four antiparallel a-helical
motifs that correspond to fragments pro23–his47, leu72–
ser88, arg92–lys115, and ser141–ser164, and also two loops
encompassing residues thr48–thr71 and ser116–tyr140.
in a previous study, we performed preliminary analyses
by circular dichroism of leptin fragments i–vi. peptides aclep23–47–nh2 (i), ac-lep72–88–nh2 (iii), ac-lep92–115–
nh2 (iv), and ac-lep141–164–nh2 (vi) did not acquire in
solution the helical conformation assumed when they are
inserted in the intact leptin [37]. fragments ac-lep48–71–
nh2 (ii) and ac-[ser117]lep116–140–nh2 (v) did not show
well-defined secondary structures, but they presented some
helical conformation. such results suggested that ac[ser117]lep116–140–nh2 (v) presented part of the structural
requirements important for the expression of leptin biological activity.
leptin receptors belong to the class i cytokine receptor
family and are found in many hypothalamic regions
including the arcuate, dorsomedial, and ventromedial nuclei
[4,31,38–40]. previous studies have described the expression of fos-ir following leptin administration in the same
hypothalamic nuclei [22,31]. most of these hypothalamic
responsive neurons also express  xxxg1320xxx  long form
mrna [23]. as fos-ir is a useful method for mapping
neuronal response to circulating leptin [22,23,31], we
decided to use it to investigate leptin fragments’ actions in
specific neuronal population.
our fragments were designed following human leptin
structure; thus, we initially test the whole leptin sequence in
order to analyze its action in the rat brain. we observed that
human leptin activates neurons located in the same
hypothalamic nuclei compared to the rat leptin sequence
[23,40]. our results indicate that the sequence of human and
murine leptin that is not homologous may not affect their
biological activities. it is important to note, though, that we
observed a decreased number of fos-ir neurons compared to

previous studies using murine leptin, which might suggest a
decreased activity.
the low percentage of fos-ir induction detected after
administration of the fragments strongly suggests that they
are not able to establish proper interactions with the leptin
receptors present in the rat hypothalamus. we found that the
only exception is ac-[ser117]lep116–140–nh2 (v), which
induced fos expression in hypothalamic nuclei, albeit in
lesser extension and intensity than the leptin molecule.
interestingly, this peptide encompasses the region of the
leptin molecule described by grasso et al. [30] to reduce
body weight gain. such effect may not be due to a direct
interaction with  xxxg1320xxx  long form since similar
results were observed in db/db mice and the fragment did not
activate signal transduction via the related receptor in vitro
[33]. it is intriguing, though, that in db/db mice, the fragment
did not reduce food intake and, in normal mice, this reduction
was only observed after long-term treatment [21,30].
in the present study, we observed that ac-[ser117]lep116–140–nh2 (v) activates arc neurons expressing
 xxxg339xxx , possibly the same group of neurons responsive to
leptin [32,41]. the arcuate  xxxg339xxx -containing neurons are
not a homogeneous population since the most rostral group
is located in the rca and anterior arc project to the spinal
cord and probably plays a role in thermoregulation and/or
cardiovascular control [31,42,43]. moreover, ac-[ser117]lep116–140–nh2 (v) also induced fos-ir in caudal dmh,
another hypothalamic nucleus that responds to leptin
[23,31]. caudal dmh expresses  xxxg1320xxx  long form
mrna and fos-ir following leptin administration. most
fos-expressing neurons project to the pvh [40], a nucleus
well known to participate in autonomic regulation via
projections to preganglionic neurons in the medulla and
spinal cord [44–46]. we hypothesize that ac-[ser117]lep116–140–nh2 (v) acts in the same arc and dmh neurons responsive to leptin, increasing energy expenditure,
but its action through leptin receptors requires further
investigation.
we also observed an increase in fos-ir in the pmv
following administration of ac-[ser117]lep116–140–nh2 (v).
the pmv expresses  xxxg1320xxx  long form and fos in
response to leptin [23,40], and part of the leptin-responsive
neurons coexpresses  xxxg339xxx  [41]. pmv also expresses a
dense collection of steroid receptors and projects to areas
related to reproductive behavior [47–49]. leptin action in
the pmv is not completely understood; leptin-deficient (ob/
ob) or unresponsive (db/db) mice are infertile and hypogonadotrophic [50,51]. therefore, the pmv appears as a
candidate to mediate leptin’s role in reproductive control.
interestingly, sharp et al. [52] have shown an increase in
 xxxd2226xxx   xxxd2520xxx  secretion after leptin fragment (116–
130) administration. in agreement, in the present study,
following ac-[ser117]lep116–140–nh2 (v) administration,
we have observed an increased fos induction in pmv
neurons but we have not found any colocalization with
 xxxg339xxx  peptide. our results might point to an activation of

v.x. oliveira jr. et al. / regulatory peptides 127 (2005) 123–132

different populations of pmv neurons by leptin and ac[ser117]lep116–140–nh2 (v).
in contrast to the whole leptin molecule action, we have
not found any consistent activation of pvh or vmh
neurons following different doses of ac-[ser117]lep116–140–
nh2 (v) or any other fragment tested. initially, we thought
that the concentration used might not be enough to trigger
neuronal responses in pvh and vmh. this differential
effect might be explained by the fact that each nucleus
receives a unique net of influence from other parts of the
brain, responding in distinct ways. however, higher doses
of ac-[ser117]lep116–140–nh2 (v) did not show any action
related to fos-ir induction in these nuclei. moreover, the
response observed in arc, dmh, and pmv was statistically
the same, suggesting that there is no clear dose-dependent
response produced by this fragment. these results add
support to the idea that ac-[ser117]lep116–140–nh2 (v) may
not act through  xxxg1320xxx . further experiments will be
necessary to address this hypothesis.
leptin deficiency causes obesity, but, paradoxically,
circulating levels of the protein are elevated in obese
humans [8]. the mechanism underlying this resistance is
unknown, but it may involve reduced leptin transport across
the blood–brain barrier [53]. thus, the disclosure of the
leptin regions responsible for the cellular response would
contribute to the understanding of protein–receptor interaction. the fact that ac-[ser117]lep116–140–nh2 (v) has
activated hypothalamic nuclei related to leptin response
does not present a dose-dependent effect indicating that its
design needs some refinements. moreover, interaction with
leptin receptors in vivo still needs to be investigated, but so
far, this fragment appears to be a good target for further
investigations employing synthetic peptides that may lead to
new information and possible pharmaceutical drugs. for this
reason, additional experiments, syntheses, and biological
tests are in progress in our laboratories.
