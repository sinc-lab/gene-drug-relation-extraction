signals induced by granulocyte  xxxg526xxx 
(g-csf), the major cytokine involved in neutrophil
development, are tightly controlled by ligand-induced
receptor internalization. truncated g-csf receptors (gcsf-rs) that fail to internalize show sustained proliferation and defective differentiation signaling. steady-state
forward routing also determines cell surface levels of
cytokine receptors, but mechanisms controlling this are
poorly understood. here, we show that wd40 and
 xxxg466xxx  (socs) box protein-2
(wsb-2), an socs box-containing wd40 protein with
currently unknown function, binds to the cooh-terminal
region of  xxxg529xxx . removal of this region did not
affect internalization, yet resulted in increased membrane expression of  xxxg529xxx  and enhanced proliferation signaling at the expense of differentiation induction.
conversely, wsb-2 binding to the  xxxg529xxx  reduced its
cell surface expression and inhibited proliferation signaling. these effects depended on the socs box involved in
ubiquitylation and on cytosolic lysines of  xxxg529xxx  and
imply a major role for ubiquitylation through the g- xxxg525xxx  c-terminus in forward routing of the receptor.
importantly, the wsb-2 gene is commonly disrupted by
virus integrations in mouse leukemia. we conclude that
control of forward routing of  xxxg529xxx  is essential for a
balanced response of myeloid progenitors to g-csf and
suggest that disturbance of this balance may contribute to
myeloid leukemia.

introduction
the  xxxg529xxx 
( xxxg529xxx ) is the major cytokine receptor involved in
neutrophil development (demetri and grifﬁn, 1991;
avalos, 1996; van de geijn et al., 2003).  xxxg529xxx 
activates multiple signaling molecules that control the
proliferation and survival of myeloid precursors. in
myeloid cell line models such as 32d,  xxxg529xxx  induces
proliferation in the ﬁrst 4–6 days of culture, followed by
growth arrest and terminal granulocytic differentiation
(dong et al., 1993; fukunaga et al., 1993). how this
balance is maintained is largely unknown. truncated
 xxxg529xxx  resulting from nonsense mutations in csfr3
are found in b20% of patients with severe congenital
neutropenia (scn). these mutations are linked with
progression of scn to acute myeloid leukemia (aml)
(van de geijn et al., 2003). the truncated g-csf-rs
confer a hyperproliferative response to g-csf in knockin mouse models and are unable to transduce differentiation signals in 32d cells (dong et al., 1998;
mclemore et al., 1998; hermans et al., 1999; ward
et al., 1999b; aarts et al., 2004). these mutants are
defective in internalization, supporting the importance
of a tight control of  xxxg529xxx  membrane expression for
a balanced signaling output (hunter and avalos, 1999;
ward et al., 1999b; aarts et al., 2004). although ligandinduced receptor endocytosis is a major mechanism
for signal attenuation, less is known of mechanisms
that control steady-state expression of cytokine receptors
on the plasma membrane and their contribution to
signaling.
we recently identiﬁed the gene encoding wd40 repeat
and  xxxg466xxx  (socs) boxcontaining protein 2 (wsb-2) in a retroviral screen for
leukemia genes (erkeland et al., 2004). wsb-1–2 proteins
share 46% homology and belong to a protein family
characterized by a socs box (sb) (hilton et al., 1998).
together with elongin b/c and cullin-2 or 5, these
proteins form elongin–cullin–socs protein (ecs) complexes, which function as e3 ubiquitin (ub) ligases and
in which the socs box proteins are thought to bind the
substrates that are targeted for ubiquitylation (kamura
et al., 1998, 2004). this was recently demonstrated for

asb-2, an sb protein involved in myeloid differentiation and for wsb-1, implicated in thyroid hormone
activation (dentice et al., 2005; heuze et al., 2005).
substrate speciﬁcities of ecs complexes are still largely
unknown. moreover, it is unclear whether sb proteins
predominantly participate in polyubiquitylation and
proteasomal degradation or also in lysosomal routing
involving mono- or multiubiquitylation of substrates
(schnell and hicke, 2003).
here, we show that wsb-2 (and the homologous
wsb-1) binds to the distal 13 amino acids of  xxxg529xxx .
in myeloid 32d cells, mutants lacking this region confer
a hyperproliferative response, associated with reduced
granulocytic differentiation. wsb affects cell surface
expression of  xxxg529xxx  via a mechanism depending on
the conserved lysine residues in the  xxxg529xxx  and on
the wsb sb, implicated in ubiquitylation of target
substrates. all integrations in wsb-2 identiﬁed in the
retroviral screen disrupted the gene structure, suggesting
that wsb-2 may act as a tumor suppressor or as a haploinsufﬁcient gene. wsb-2 expression was also reduced in
a subclass of aml patients. based on these ﬁndings, we
propose a model in which wsb-2 induces ubiquitylation
of the  xxxg529xxx , thereby controlling steady-state surface expression levels. this control appears essential for
the appropriate balance of g-csf-induced proliferation
and differentiation, and may be lost in cases of murine
and human aml.

results
wsb binds to the cooh terminus of  xxxg529xxx  in yeast
two-hybrid and co-immunoprecipitation assays and
colocalizes with  xxxg529xxx  in intact cells
previous studies indicated that the carboxyl terminal
(c-terminal) part of the  xxxg529xxx  is crucial for g-csfinduced granulocytic differentiation (dong et al., 1993;
fukunaga et al., 1993). yeast two-hybrid (y2h)
analysis was performed to identify proteins that interact
with this region. using g-csf-r762-813 as bait,
candidate interacting proteins were identiﬁed, including
the wd40 repeat domain proteins fizzy-related 1
(fzr1), wsb-1 and wsb-2 (figure 1, upper panel).
deletion of the sb domain (dsb) did not affect wsb-1/2
binding to the  xxxg529xxx  bait (figure 1, upper panel).
wsb proteins failed to interact with g-csf-r762-790,
indicating that the distal 23 amino acids of  xxxg529xxx  are
crucial for binding (figure 1, lower panel). in cos cells,
flag-tagged wsb-1 and wsb-2 co-immunoprecipitated with  xxxg529xxx  in hemagglutinin-immunoprecipitation (ha-ip)’s, as did the wd40 domain of fzr1
(figure 2a). no interactions were seen with an irrelevant
control protein sv40 large t (svt) or with empty
vector controls (figure 2a). similar results were
obtained in the reverse flag ip/ha western experiments (figure 2b). no interactions were observed
between g-csf-rd715 and wsb-1, wsb-2 or fzrwd40 (figure 2c and d). confocal laser scanning
microscopy (clsm) showed that wsb-2 colocalized

lack the wd40-interacting distal 23 amino acids (figure
3b and c). conversely, g-csf-rd749-769, a mutant
defective in internalization but retaining its distal region,
again colocalized with wsb in intracellular vesicles
(figure 3d).
 xxxg529xxx /wsb interactions in mammalian
protein–protein interaction trap assay
to establish that wsb and  xxxg529xxx  proteins interact in
living mammalian cells in the correct subcellular
context, we performed mammalian protein–protein
interaction trap (mappit), a cytokine receptor-based
two-hybrid assay (eyckerman et al., 2001). intracellular
fragments of  xxxg529xxx  were coupled to the c terminus
of the erythropoietin (epo)/ xxxg1320xxx  hybrid bait
(figure 4a) (tavernier et al., 2002). first, we validated
the mappit system for  xxxg529xxx -containing baits
using preys containing full-length shc or grb2, proteins
that bind directly to phosphorylated y764 of  xxxg529xxx 
(ward et al., 1999a). as predicted, shc and grb2
interacted efﬁciently with bait c65, but not with c65y764f (figure 4b). wsb-1 and wsb-2 strongly interacted with c65, whereas no binding with the control bait
( xxxg718xxx ) was observed (eyckerman et al., 2002)
(figure 4c). these results show that wsb speciﬁcally
binds to the  xxxg529xxx  and not to the  xxxg1320xxx 
backbone of the bait. fzr1 did not bind to the g- xxxg525xxx  bait (data not shown), indicating that wsb, but not
fzr1 may control  xxxg529xxx  function. removal of the
sb did not affect wsb binding to c65. wsb binding to
c65d803 was strongly reduced and no longer detected

with c65d792 (figure 4d). these results corroborate
the y2h, immunoprecipitation and clsm experiments
and establish that wsb binding speciﬁcally occurs to the
c-terminal 10–20 amino acids of the  xxxg529xxx .
wsb-binding region of  xxxg529xxx  inﬂuences steady-state
expression levels and controls the balance between
proliferation and differentiation signals
to study the role of wsb-binding amino acids in
 xxxg529xxx  distribution and function, we generated multiple independent clones of 32dcl10 cells expressing a
c-terminal deletion mutant lacking the 13 c-terminal
amino acids (g-csf-rd800). steady-state membrane
expression of g-csf-rd800 was consistently increased
compared to wt  xxxg529xxx  (figure 5a). contrary to
g-csf-rd715, ligand-induced internalization of g-csfrd800 in 32d cells was normal and occurred with
similar kinetics as internalization of wt  xxxg529xxx 
(figure 5b), indicating that increased expression levels
were not due to defective endocytosis. the rate of
proliferation of 32d/g-csf-rd800 cells in g-csfcontaining cultures was signiﬁcantly increased compared to 32d/ xxxg529xxx -wt and matched growth rates
of 32d/g-csf-rd715 in the ﬁrst days of culture

(figure 5c). this was accompanied by a lack of terminal
neutrophilic differentiation (figure 5d), indicating a
major role of the c-distal 13 amino acids of  xxxg529xxx  in
controlling the proliferation/differentiation balance in
response to g-csf.
wsb fusion reduces steady-state  xxxg529xxx  expression on
the plasma membrane
next, we determined the effects of wsb on  xxxg529xxx 
distribution. unfortunately, we could not generate 32d
clones stably expressing wsb-1 or wsb-2, possibly
because wd40 repeats bind to substrates that are
crucial for cell growth (smith et al., 1999; neer and
smith, 2000). to overcome this problem, we generated
constructs with wsb-1 or wsb-2 fused to  xxxg529xxx 
mutant  xxxd769xxx  via a ﬂexible linker (ggs) (figure 6a).
although membrane expression of g-csf-rd769
was consistently higher than that of wt  xxxg529xxx ,
fusion of wsb-2 to g-csf-rd769 signiﬁcantly reduced
membrane expression levels, an effect that depended
on the sb (figure 6b). similar results were obtained
with g-csf-rd769-wsb1 fusions (data not shown).

(k5r-g-csf-rd769-wsb2) reverted membrane expression to normal levels, suggesting a role of ubiquitylation
of receptor lysines in steady-state distribution of gcsf-r (figure 6c). indeed, we could demonstrate
ubiquitylation of lysines in wt- xxxg529xxx  (figure 6d,
upper panel). the size distribution of ub- xxxg529xxx 
species was suggestive of mono- or multi- instead of
polyubiquitylation, which is in agreement with the lack
of reactivity with fk2, a monoclonal antibody (mab)
with high afﬁnity for poly-ub (figure 6d, middle panel)
(haglund et al., 2003). staining for  xxxg529xxx  showed
signiﬁcantly higher protein levels of k5r compared with
wt  xxxg529xxx  (figure 6d, lower panel), suggesting that
the receptor lysines are crucial for protein degradation.
g-csf-rd769-wsb2 predominantly accumulated in the
endoplasmic reticulum and intracellular vesicles,
whereas g-csf-rd769-wsb2dsb and k5r-g-csfrd769-wsb2 were both mainly found on the cell
membrane (figure 6e). in agreement with this, g-csfinduced phosphorylation of stat3,  xxxg2216xxx , erk,
p38mapk (figure 7a) and janus-activated kinase (jak)2
(figure 7b) in g-csf-rd769-wsb1/2-expressing cells
was strongly diminished compared to  xxxg529xxx   xxxd769xxx .
oncogene

this inhibitory effect of wsb again depended on the
presence of the sb. electrophoretic mobility shift assay
(emsa) analysis of activated stat3 and  xxxg2216xxx  as
well as long-term suspension cultures gave similar results
and conﬁrmed that the lysines in  xxxg529xxx  are crucial
for the inhibitory effects of wsb (figure 7c and d).
involvement of wsb-2 in aml
previously, we identiﬁed wsb-2 in a common virus
integration site in a murine myeloid leukemia model
(erkeland et al., 2004). locus-speciﬁc polymerase chain
reaction (pcr) (figure 8a) showed that the ﬁve
integrations in wsb-2 identiﬁed in independent leukemia
samples occurred between exons 4 and 7, leading to
disruption of the gene (figure 8b). because of the nonclonal nature of murine leukemia virus (mulv)induced tumors (erkeland et al., 2003, 2004), we were
unable to verify the status of the other allele or to
determine wsb-2 expression levels in single leukemic
clones. as an alternative, we examined wsb-2 expression in human aml, using gene expression proﬁling
data set of 285 aml cases (valk et al., 2004).

signiﬁcance analysis of microarrays (tusher et al.,
2001) revealed that wsb-2 expression is signiﬁcantly
decreased (fold change ¼ 0.45152, score ¼ 6.33656,
q-value ¼ 0.109866108) in a subclass of patients (cluster
4), characterized by mutations in cebpa (valk et al.,
2004). these data were conﬁrmed by quantitative
reverse transcriptase–pcr (not shown) and suggest that
reduced wsb-2 levels may play a role in perturbed
g-csf responses in this group of aml patients.

discussion
the key observations reported here are that (i) wsb
proteins bind to the  xxxg529xxx  c terminus and thereby
modulate plasma membrane levels of  xxxg529xxx , (ii)

removal of the wsb-binding domain increases the
proliferation signaling abilities of  xxxg529xxx  at the
expense of its ability to induce differentiation and (iii)
lysines in the  xxxg529xxx  and the e3 ligase-recruiting
sb of wsb are both necessary for  xxxg529xxx  distribution
and signaling function, suggesting that wsb acts
via ubiquitylation of the  xxxg529xxx . given that one ub
moiety increases the molecular size of a protein
with b8 kda, it appears that  xxxg529xxx  is mainly mono- or multiubiquitylated. whereas polyubiquitylation
serves as a signal for proteasome-mediated protein
degradation, mono-ubs act as a sorting signals
for delivery of proteins in the biosynthetic or endocytic
pathway to multivesicular bodies and lysosomes
(aguilar and wendland, 2003; hicke and dunn, 2003).
direct or indirect association with e3 ligases regulates
cell surface expression of a number of receptors.

for instance, for the degradation of the interferon a
receptor 1 ( xxxg1138xxx ), a mechanism was proposed
involving the homolog of slimb (hos) f-box protein,
which interacts with  xxxg2074xxx  and cullin-1 to form the
scfhos e3 complex (kumar et al., 2003, 2004). similar
to wsb, hos (alternatively termed b-trcp2 or fbw1b)
binds to substrates via its wd40 domain. lysine
residues in the cytoplasmic tail that are ubiquitylated
by scfhos are essential for  xxxg1138xxx  degradation
(kumar et al., 2003). however, a major difference is
that binding of wsb to  xxxg529xxx  does not require
receptor activation. this supports the notion that wsb
proteins are dispensable for ligand-induced internalization, but mainly affect the steady-state membrane
expression of  xxxg529xxx  by targeting excess protein for
lysosomal degradation. a similar role has recently been
proposed for socs5 in the control of the steady-state
distribution of the  xxxg681xxx  receptor
(kario et al., 2005).
oncogene

to study the consequences of reduced wsb levels on
 xxxg529xxx  distribution, we have attempted to knockdown wsb-1 and wsb-2 expression using small interfering (si) rna. however, although signiﬁcant reduction
of wsb transcript levels in hek293 and 32d cells was
achieved, sirnas were found to nonspeciﬁcally reduce
 xxxg529xxx  expression on the cell membrane. recent
studies have revealed that sirnas cause the activation
of toll-like receptors and induce strong ifn responses
in cells, which might explain these nonspeciﬁc effects
(reynolds et al., 2006). because wsb-1 and wsb-2
(double) knockout mice are not yet available, the
question whether wsb-1 and wsb-2 have unique or
(partly) redundant functions in  xxxg529xxx  routing and
signaling cannot be addressed at present.
wsb fusion to the  xxxg529xxx  resulted in more
prominent effects than the presence of the  xxxg529xxx 
region involved in wsb binding, both on receptor
routing (compare figures 6d and 3a, left panel) and

wsb-2 controls  xxxg529xxx  routing

1991

on signaling (figure 7). the reason for this is unclear
but likely relates to temporal and stoichiometric aspects
of the protein–protein interaction that are overridden by
the fusion. nonetheless, the results are compatible with
a role of the receptor c-terminus in recruiting e3 ligase
activity that ubiquitylates one or more of the conserved
lysine residues in the  xxxg529xxx , thereby controlling its
steady-state membrane expression as well as overall
protein stability. previous studies showed that socs3
acts in a negative feedback loop, involving g-csfinduced activation of stat3, stat3-induced transcription of socs3 and binding of socs3 protein to
phosphorylated y729 of  xxxg529xxx  (hermans, 2003 no.
17; hortner, 2002, no. 25; van de geijn, 2004, no. 26). in
contrast, wsb-1 and wsb2 transcript levels were high in
non-stimulated 32d cells and primary bone marrow
progenitors and not altered by g-csf (data not shown).
although socs3 attenuates g-csf signaling from
activated receptors, wsb appears to control steady-state
lysosomal degradation as well as the levels of  xxxg529xxx 
expressed on the cell membrane, thereby contributing
upfront to a balanced response of myeloid precursors to
g-csf. the observation that disruption of the wsb-2
gene (mouse leukemia) and truncation of the  xxxg529xxx 
c-terminus (scn/aml patients) are both associated
with aml supports the notion that disruption of the
control of steady-state expression of  xxxg529xxx  leads to
perturbed myeloid differentiation in vivo and may
contribute to leukemic outgrowth.

y2h was performed using yeast strain pj69-4a (dr philip
james, university of wisconsin, madison, wi, usa) as
described (james et al., 1996; van zon et al., 2002). as prey
library, a mouse 17-day embryo cdna library (matchmaker,
clontech laboratories, palo alto, ca, usa) was used. for a
second screen, cdna library plasmids were co-transformed
with the pgbt9-gcsfr762-813 or pgbt9-gcsfr762-790

sequenced (abi 3100, applied biosystems, weiterstadt,

retroviral gene transfer in 32d cells
 xxxg1177xxx -dependent murine myeloid 32d cells were infected with
the different babe-based retroviral vectors and selected on
1 mg/ml  xxxd3041xxx  (sigma, zwijndrecht, the netherlands) as
described (aarts et al., 2004). retroviral vectors are described
in supplementary materials and methods.

flow cytometric analysis of  xxxg529xxx  expression and
internalization in transduced 32d cells
to determine  xxxg529xxx  expression, transduced 32d cells
were labeled with biotinylated antihuman antibody recognizing an n-terminal extracellular epitope of the  xxxg529xxx 
(lmm741; pharmingen, san diego, ca, usa), subsequently
incubated with phycoerythrin-conjugated streptavidin (sa-pe;
dako diagnostics, glostrup, denmark) and analysed
by ﬂow cytometry using a facscan (becton dickinson,
sunnyvale, ca, usa) as described (aarts et al., 2004).
ligand-induced internalization was assessed at several
time points after g-csf treatment as described (aarts et al.,
2004).

stat3 and  xxxg2216xxx  electrophoretic mobility shift assay
emsa to detect activated stat3 and  xxxg2216xxx  complexes in
nuclear extracts of 32d cell transfectants were performed as
described (de koning et al., 2000).

detection of virus integrations in wsb-2
to determine orientation and localization of gr-1.4. mulv
integrations in wsb-2, a nested pcr was performed on
genomic dna from primary tumors as described (erkeland
et al., 2004) (figure 1a). for the ﬁrst pcr, wsb-2-speciﬁc
primers a, b, c and d were used in combination with gr-1.4
long terminal repeat (ltr)-speciﬁc primers l1 and l2. for
the nested pcr, wsb-2-speciﬁc primers e, f, g and h were used
in combination with gr-1.4 ltr-speciﬁc primers l1n and
l2n. pcr fragments were analysed as described (erkeland
et al., 2004).

figure 8 gr-1.4 mulv integrations in wsb-2. (a) pcr strategy to
detect position and orientation of gr-1.4 integrations in wsb-2.
translated exons of wsb-2 are shown as black boxes; white boxes
represent untranslated regions of exons 1 and 9. ltr forward and
ltr reverse indicate orientations of the integrated virus. depending on position and orientation of the virus integration, pcr
products will be formed. for example, when the virus is integrated
in the forward orientation in intron 5, use of primer combination
(a, l1) and nested primers (e, l1n), and/or primer combination
(c, l2) and nested primers (g, l2n) will result in pcr products.
primer combinations are described in materials and methods.
(b) examples of virus integration sites in wsb-2. arrows indicate
positions and orientation of the integrations.

 xxxg529xxx  ubiquitylation
phoenix e cells (g. nolan, stanford, ca, usa) were transfected with ha-tagged wild type (wt) or mutant- xxxg529xxx  and

wsb-2 expression in human aml
real-time pcr was performed on complementary dna from
260 aml patients using an applied biosystems 7900
instrument (applied biosystems, weiterstadt, germany)
and sybr green pcr master mix (applied biosystems)
(erkeland et al., 2003; valk et al., 2004). primers were wsb2f6 and wsb-2r6. the porphobilinogen deaminase gene was
taken as reference (erkeland et al., 2003).
