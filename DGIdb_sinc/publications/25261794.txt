molecular characterization of  xxxd1983xxx  as a potential ligand
targeting mu- xxxg1632xxx  heteromers

way in which allosteric modulation of  xxxg1635xxx  properties by dor
could occur is via the formation of  xxxg1635xxx -dor heteromers; mordor heteromerization is supported by studies using antibodies
that selectively target the heteromer [10] or tat peptides that can
disrupt the formation of  xxxg1635xxx -dor heteromers [11]. ligands
targeting  xxxg1635xxx -dor heteromers either by having  xxxg1635xxx  agonist/
dor antagonist activity such as bivalent ligands or ligands
possessing mixed  xxxg1635xxx  agonist and dor antagonist activity have
been generated [12–17]. studies using a bivalent ligand comprising
of a  xxxg1635xxx  agonistic pharmacophore separated by a 21-atom spacer
arm from a dor antagonistic pharmacophore (mdan21) [15,17]
showed that it exhibited 100-times higher

loperamide, mice were treated with these drugs at the dose of
10 mg/kg (p.o.) once a day for 5 days. on the 6th day, mice were
euthanized by cervical dislocation and ileum was collected (3–4
mice/sample) for elisa assay.
2.6. castor oil-induced diarrhea
mice were placed in new absorbent lined bottomed cages with
no access to food and water for 2 h before the test. immediately
before the test, the absorbent liner was discarded, and a fresh preweighed liner was placed in the cage. diarrhea was induced by oral
administration of castor oil (0.6 ml/mouse) (acros organics, geel,
belgium) to wt or dor/ mice. stools were scored (diarrhea score
of 0 = normal; 1 = wet and irregular shape; or 2 = shapeless) and
weighed over a 4-h period as described previously [28,29]. after
every hour, the absorbent liner was weighed, and another preweighed liner was placed in the cage. diarrhea score represents the
most marked change in feces for individual mice during a 4-h
period. loperamide and  xxxd1983xxx  were administered orally
15 min before the castor oil administration. when naltrexone
(10 mg/kg, i.p.) was used, it was administered 20 min before
loperamide or  xxxd1983xxx  administration. body weight was
measured before and 4 h after castor oil administration.
2.7. elisa assay
ileal longitudinal muscle (containing myenteric plexus) was
prepared as described previously [24]. membranes (10 mg) from
mouse ileal longitudinal muscle were subjected to an elisa assay
using rat anti- xxxg1635xxx  antibody (1:500), rat anti-dor antibody (1:500)
(generated as reported in [26]) or mouse anti- xxxg1635xxx -dor heteromer
selective antibody (1:100) as primary antibodies and anti-mouse

anti-rat igg (1:1000) (jackson immunoresearch laboratories, inc.,

shown that they can block heteromer-mediated binding and
signaling [10,26]. also, we had previously reported that activation
b
of dor can lead to b-arrestin recruitment to  xxxg1635xxx  in  xxxg1635xxx  gal-dor
cells and this can be blocked by  xxxg1635xxx -dor heteromer-selective
antibodies [26]. in agreement with these observations we ﬁnd that
deltorphin ii (delt ii; r&d systems, minneapolis, usa), the dor
selective agonist, induces b-arrestin recruitment to  xxxg1635xxx  in
morbgal-dor cells (fig. 3b) but not to mbgalor cells (fig. 3a)
and this can be blocked by  xxxg1635xxx -dor heteromer-selective
antibodies and not by  xxxg1635xxx -selective antibodies or by antibodies
selective to an unrelated heteromer, i.e., the  xxxg479xxx - xxxg100xxx  heteromer
(fig. 3b). we ﬁnd that loperamide-mediated b-arrestin recruitb
b
ment both in m galor (fig. 3a) and  xxxg1635xxx  gal-dor cells (fig. 3b) is
signiﬁcantly blocked by  xxxg1635xxx -selective antibodies but not by
antibodies selective for either the  xxxg1635xxx -dor or  xxxg479xxx - xxxg100xxx 
heteromer. this supports that loperamide exerts its effects by
activating  xxxg1635xxx . in the case of  xxxd1983xxx , we ﬁnd that its ability to
induce b-arrestin recruitment is blocked by  xxxg1635xxx -selective
b
antibodies by 40% in m galor cells (fig. 3a) and by 17% in
bgal
 xxxg1635xxx  -dor cells (fig. 3b). in addition, we ﬁnd that  xxxg1635xxx -dor

heteromer-selective antibodies block 27% of  xxxd1983xxx -mediated

b-arrestin recruitment in morbgal-dor cells (fig. 3b) but have no
b
effect in m galor cells (fig. 3a); no effect of  xxxg479xxx - xxxg100xxx  heteromerselective antibodies on  xxxd1983xxx -mediated b-arrestin recruitb
b
ment was observed in either m galor (fig. 3a) or  xxxg1635xxx  gal-dor cells
(fig. 3b). taken together these results suggest that in cells coexpressing  xxxg1635xxx  and dor a portion of  xxxd1983xxx -mediated
signaling occurs via activation of  xxxg1635xxx -dor heteromers while in
cells expressing only  xxxg1635xxx   xxxd1983xxx  functions as a  xxxg1635xxx  agonist.
3.2. castor oil-induced diarrhea
previous studies showed that  xxxd1983xxx  can normalize gi
transit over a wider dose range compared to loperamide in wt
mice [16]. although wt mice express both  xxxg1635xxx  and dor in
myenteric plexus [32], not much is known about the contribution
of each receptor type or of  xxxg1635xxx -dor heteromers to the effects
of  xxxd1983xxx  on gi transit. to investigate this we used wt and
dor/ mice and compared the effects of  xxxd1983xxx  and
loperamide on castor oil induced diarrhea. we ﬁnd that oral

administration of castor oil induces severe diarrhea (i.e., higher
score) both in wt (fig. 4a) and dor/ mice (fig. 4b). the castor
oil-induced diarrhea in wt mice was reduced by administration of
5 or 10 mg/kg of either loperamide or  xxxd1983xxx  (fig. 4a).
moreover, this reduction in castor oil-induced diarrhea by either
loperamide or  xxxd1983xxx   xxxd1891xxx  mg/kg were not observed if the
animals were pre-treated with the m

fig. 4. effect of loperamide and  xxxd1983xxx  on castor oil-induced diarrhea. diarrhea was induced by oral administration of castor oil (0.6 ml/mouse) in wt (a) or dor/ (b)
mice. stools were scored for diarrhea (0 = normal; 1 = wet and irregular shape; or 2 = shapeless) for 4 h as described in section 2. loperamide and  xxxd1983xxx  (5 or 10 mg/kg)
were administered orally 15 min before the castor oil administration. naltrexone (10 mg/kg, i.p.) was administered 20 min before loperamide or  xxxd1983xxx  administration.

observed in dor/ but not in wt mice which would again indicate
that dor activity may modulate  xxxd1983xxx ’s effects on  xxxg1635xxx  in wt
mice and that  xxxd1983xxx  behaves as a  xxxg1635xxx  agonist in mice that
lack dor.
next we examined the changes in body weight in wt and dor/
mice and found that in both groups castor oil-induced diarrhea led to
decreases in body weight (fig. 6a and b) and this was blocked by
loperamide and  xxxd1983xxx . both loperamide and  xxxd1983xxx  effects
could be partly blocked by naltrexone. although not statistically
signiﬁcant, the amount of body weight change in dor/ appeared
more robust compared to wt mice. interestingly, the effect of
naltrexone was more pronounced in dor/ mice (fig. 6). the fact
that 5 mg/kg  xxxd1983xxx  was less effective in dor/ mice as
compared to the wt mice is consistent with the results with diarrhea
score and fecal output and further support a role for dor (or mordor heteromer) in this effect in wt mice.
3.3. chronic  xxxd1983xxx  treatment
we have previously reported/noted that chronic treatment
with morphine under a paradigm that leads to the development of

tolerance causes an increase in  xxxg1635xxx -dor heteromer expression in
different brain regions [10]. therefore, in this study we examined
whether  xxxg1635xxx -dor heteromers are present in myenteric neurons
from gi tissue and ascertained the effect of long-term treatment
with loperamide or  xxxd1983xxx  on receptor expression and on
body weight. we ﬁnd that administration of these compounds at
the dose of 10 mg/kg/day for 5 days did not lead to signiﬁcant
changes in body weight (fig. 7a), indicating that repeated oral
treatment with either drug would not affect the nutrient
absorptive function in intestine. in addition, using antibodies
selective for either  xxxg1635xxx , dor or  xxxg1635xxx -dor heteromers we can
detect the presence of  xxxg1635xxx , dor or  xxxg1635xxx -dor heteromers in mouse
ileal longitudinal muscle (containing the myenteric plexus)
(fig. 7b). in vehicle treated animals levels of dor appear to be
the highest, followed by levels of  xxxg1635xxx  and  xxxg1635xxx -dor heteromers.
these results support ﬁndings by a study reporting co-localization
of  xxxg1635xxx  and dor in myenteric neurons [32]. in addition, we ﬁnd
that chronic treatment with loperamide or  xxxd1983xxx  does not
induce signiﬁcant changes in the levels of  xxxg1635xxx , dor or  xxxg1635xxx -dor
heteromer levels in ileal longitudinal muscle preparations containing myenteric plexus from wt mice.

fig. 5. effect of loperamide and  xxxd1983xxx  on castor oil-induced diarrhea (fecal output). diarrhea was induced by oral administration of castor oil (0.6 ml/mouse) in wt (a)
or dor/ (b) mice. stools were collected and weighed during 4 h as described in section 2. loperamide and  xxxd1983xxx  (5 or 10 mg/kg) were administered orally 15 min
before the castor oil administration. naltrexone (10 mg/kg, i.p.) was administered 20 min before loperamide or  xxxd1983xxx  administration. results are the mean  s.e.m.
n = 3–6. **p < 0.01, vs. vehicle control; ##p < 0.01, vs. castor oil alone; $$p < 0.01, vs. castor oil + loperamide (10 mg/kg, p.o.); yyp < 0.01, vs. castor oil +  xxxd1983xxx  (10 mg/kg, p.o),
student–newman–keuls test.

4. discussion
several studies have examined the pharmacological proﬁles of

 xxxg1635xxx -dor heteromers (reviewed in [35,36]). among them a few
have demonstrated that occupancy of dor enhances  xxxg1635xxx  activity.
thus dor selective antagonists were shown to enhance  xxxg1635xxx  ligand
binding,  xxxg1635xxx  ligand-mediated signaling and  xxxg1635xxx -mediated (i.e.,
morphine-mediated) analgesia [7–9,37]. furthermore, studies
showed that mice with reduced dor levels (through the use of
antisense oligonucleotides) or dor/ mice did not develop
tolerance or dependence to morphine [38,39]. together these
studies indicate that the use of dor antagonists could lead to a
decrease in the adverse effects associated with in

showing that  xxxd1983xxx  even at doses of 5–25 mg/kg did not
cause constipation in the novel-environment stressed mice model
of diarrhea [16]. these differences could be due to the differences
in the stressor used in the studies (novel environment vs. castor
oil) and the time period for measuring fecal output since wade
et al. (2012) measured for only 1 h after the novel-environment
stress, while we measured for 4 h after castor oil injection. castor
oil is known to release ricinoleic acid followed by alterations in ion
transport and water ﬂux in the intestine [43–46] leading to
increases in fecal output or diarrhea. in contrast, novel environment stress is a form of psychological stress that is accompanied by
behavioral changes like grooming, rearing and snifﬁng [47–49]. it
is known that the novel-environment-induced increase in fecal
output is mediated by an increase in corticotropin-releasing
hormone and  xxxg2328xxx  and by activation of
cholinergic and serotonergic neurons [50]. it is possible that these
differences as well as changes in the levels and/or activity of
intestinal  xxxg1635xxx -dor heteromers under these two assay conditions
are responsible for the observed differences.
relatively few studies have examined the levels of opioid
receptor proteins in the gi tract. using enhanced green ﬂuorescent
protein (egfp)-tagged dor (doregfp) expressing mice, the
distribution of dor was found to be conﬁned to enteric neurons
and ﬁbers within the muscularis externa; submucosal plexus and
myenteric plexus [32]. this study also showed that, in the
myenteric ganglia, over 80% of doregfp positive myenteric
neurons co-expressed  xxxg1635xxx , and 60% of  xxxg1635xxx  positive neurons
co-expressed doregfp [32]. this is consistent with a previous
study that showed co-localization of  xxxg1635xxx  and dor in myenteric
neurons by immunohistochemistry [51]. these results suggest that
 xxxg1635xxx -dor heteromers are present in the myenteric neurons. in this
study, we detected the presence of  xxxg1635xxx -dor heteromers in ileal
longitudinal muscle of mice that includes myenteric neurons [24]
using  xxxg1635xxx -dor heteromer-selective antibodies. together these
results support the presence of  xxxg1635xxx -dor heteromers in ileal
tissue.
studies have shown that chronic morphine treatment leads to
increase in  xxxg1635xxx -dor heteromer levels in select brain regions
[10]. moreover,  xxxg1635xxx -dor heteromerization changes morphinemediated signaling from g-protein- into b-arrestin mediated
which could contribute to side-effects such as the development of
analgesic tolerance [11,37,52]. interestingly, b-arrestin2 knockout
mice exhibit less morphine-induced constipation than their wt
counterparts [53], indicating an involvement of b-arrestin
mediated signaling (potentially via  xxxg1635xxx -dor heteromers) in the
constipating effects of morphine [54]. however, chronic morphine
administration does not lead to development of tolerance to the
constipating side-effect [55–58]. this led us to wonder if intestinal
 xxxg1635xxx , dor, and  xxxg1635xxx -dor heteromer levels are altered following
chronic treatment with drugs. in this study we did not detect
signiﬁcant changes in  xxxg1635xxx , dor, and  xxxg1635xxx -dor heteromer levels in
the intestine following chronic treatment with either loperamide
or  xxxd1983xxx  compared to controls treated with vehicle (fig. 7).
however, preliminary studies detect a slight increase albeit not
signiﬁcant in  xxxg1635xxx -dor heteromer levels in ileum following
chronic morphine administration (data not shown). this would
suggest a differential regulation of  xxxg1635xxx -dor heteromer function in
brain and gut, which is consistent with what has been previously
reported [54].
the detection of  xxxg1635xxx -dor heteromers in mouse ileal tissue
together with the anti-diarrheal effect of  xxxd1983xxx  and in vitro
data showing that  xxxd1983xxx -mediated signaling is reduced by
 xxxg1635xxx -dor heteromer-selective antibodies indicates that  xxxd1983xxx , at least in part, mediates its effects by targeting  xxxg1635xxx -dor
heteromers in the intestine. this would suggest that intestinal
 xxxg1635xxx -dor heteromers could be a potential therapeutic target for

455

the treatment of gi tract disorders including ibs-d. however,
additional studies examining the level and changes in the
localization of  xxxg1635xxx -dor heteromers in the human gi tract
following ibs-d are required to demonstrate that the  xxxg1635xxx -dor
heteromer is a novel therapeutic target for the treatment of this
disorder.
in this study, we ﬁnd that in the absence of dor,  xxxd1983xxx 
behaves as a potent  xxxg1635xxx  agonist. however, co-expression of  xxxg1635xxx 
and dor alters the signaling proﬁle of  xxxd1983xxx  that can be
partly blocked by  xxxg1635xxx -dor heteromer-selective antibodies. thus,
the actions of  xxxd1983xxx  could, at least in part, be due to targeting
of  xxxg1635xxx -dor heteromers in the gut. in addition, we ﬁnd that
 xxxd1983xxx  can block castor oil-induced diarrhea in wt mice and
this is attenuated in dor/ mice indicating the involvement of
dor probably through  xxxg1635xxx -dor heteromerization in the in vivo
effects of  xxxd1983xxx .
