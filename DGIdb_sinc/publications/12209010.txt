voltage clamp 兩 delayed rectifier 兩 xenopus oocyte

erg encodes ␣-subunits that coassemble to form channels
that conduct the rapid delayed rectifier k⫹ current (ikr) in the
heart (1, 2). ikr is activated by membrane depolarization and is a key
determinant of action potential duration in the ventricle. mutations
in herg that lead to a partial or complete loss of function are a
major cause of dominantly inherited long qt syndrome (lqts)
(3). the hallmark arrhythmia associated with lqts is torsades de
pointes. this arrhythmia can spontaneously revert to normal sinus
rhythm or degenerate into ventricular fibrillation and cause sudden
death (4). inherited lqts also can be caused by gain of function
mutations in the cardiac na⫹ channel gene  xxxg2028xxx  or loss of
function mutations in other cardiac k⫹ channel genes, including
 xxxg1268xxx ,  xxxg1245xxx , and kcnj2 (5).
acquired lqts is more common than inherited lqts and is
usually caused by preferential block of ikr by common medications. this undesirable side effect has prompted removal of
several drugs from the market and is now recognized as a
significant hurdle in the development of new and safer drugs. for
example,  xxxd1708xxx  is a prokinetic agent that was widely used for
the treatment of gastrointestinal motility disorders until it was
discovered that on rare occasions this drug was associated with
arrhythmia and sudden death. soon afterward it was demonstrated that  xxxd1708xxx  is a potent herg channel blocker (6).
elucidating the molecular mechanisms of herg by  xxxd1708xxx 
and other drugs will facilitate the rational drug design of new
pharmaceutical compounds devoid of this unwanted side effect.

the key residues that determine high-affinity block of herg
channels by several chemically unrelated compounds, including
 xxxd1708xxx , terfenadine, and the antiarrhythmic agents quinidine,
dofetilide, and mk-499, were recently described (7, 8). these
residues were localized to the s6 domain and the bottom of pore
helix, and homology modeling predicted they faced the central
cavity of the herg channel. most important were the aromatic
residues tyr-652 and phe-656, located one helical turn away
from one another in the s6 domain. mutation of either residue
to an ala drastically reduced the potency of channel block by
 xxxd1708xxx , terfenadine, mk-499 (8), chloroquine (9), or  xxxd3507xxx  (10). these findings suggest that tyr-652 and phe-656 are
the most important determinants of binding to herg by
structurally diverse drugs.
herg belongs to the eag family of potassium channels. the
amino acid sequence of the s6 domain of eag is 50% identical to
herg, and tyr-652 and phe-656 of herg is conserved in eag.
however, eag channels do not inactivate and are relatively insensitive to block by drugs that inhibit herg. differential drug
sensitivity of channels has been explained by the presence (herg)
or absence (eag) of inactivation gating and several studies have
demonstrated a positive correlation between inactivation and block.
first, the s620t mutation in herg channels caused a loss of
inactivation and dramatically reduced the sensitivity of mutant
channels to block by dofetilide (11). second, eag-herg chimeric
channels that contain part of the pore and s6 domains from herg
inactivated and were sensitive to block by e-4031 (12). third,
introduction of three point mutations into the pore of bovine eag
channels were shown to induce inactivation and confer sensitivity to
block by dofetilide (13). however, the link between inactivation and
drug sensitivity has been confused by other findings. specifically,
some mutations in herg removed inactivation, but the mutant
channels retained relatively high sensitivity to block by methanesulfonanilides (8, 14). moreover, other mutations increased inactivation compared to wild-type (wt) herg channels, but greatly
reduced drug sensitivity (8). these inconsistent findings indicate
that the molecular mechanisms of herg channel block, especially
the role of inactivation, is not well understood.
the aim of the present study was to reconcile the disparate
findings concerning the role of inactivation as a critical determinant
for potent drug block of herg. we hypothesized that gating of
herg channels includes a twisting of s6 and repositioning of
tyr-652 and phe-656 in an orientation that is associated with c-type
inactivation and optimal for drug binding, and that activationassociated gating of eag is insufficient to reposition these residues
in the equivalent orientation. to test this hypothesis, we used
site-directed mutagenesis to relocate the tyr or phe in the s6

pharmacology

unintended block of herg kⴙ channels is a side effect of many
common medications and is the most common cause of acquired
long qt syndrome associated with increased risk of life-threatening arrhythmias. the molecular mechanism of high-affinity herg
block by structurally diverse compounds has been attributed to
␲-stacking and cation-␲ interactions of a drug (e.g.,  xxxd1708xxx ) with
specific aromatic amino acid residues (tyr-652 and phe-656) in the
s6 ␣-helical domain that face the central cavity of the channel. it
also has been proposed that strong c-type inactivation of herg
facilitates or is the primary determinant of high-affinity drug
binding. the structurally related, but noninactivating eag channel
is insensitive to herg blockers unless inactivation is induced by
specific amino acid mutations [ficker, e., jarolimek, w. & brown,
a. m. (2001) mol. pharmacol. 60, 1343–1348]. here we examine the
relative importance of inactivation vs. positioning of s6 aromatic
residues in determining sensitivity of herg and eag channels to
block by  xxxd1708xxx . the repositioning of tyr-652 or phe-656 along
the s6 ␣-helical domain of herg reduced sensitivity of channels to
block by  xxxd1708xxx . moreover, independent of inactivation, repositioning of the equivalent aromatic residues in drosophila eag
channels induced sensitivity to block by  xxxd1708xxx . these findings
suggest that positioning of s6 aromatic residues relative to the
central cavity of the channel, not inactivation per se determines
drug block of herg or eag channels.

domain of herg or drosophila eag and tested the sensitivity of the
resultant mutant channels to block by  xxxd1708xxx . similar to most
drugs that block herg,  xxxd1708xxx  strongly interacts with tyr-652
and phe-656 of the s6 domain, yet unlike the methanesulfonanilides
has minimal or no interaction with the pore helix. by shifting the
position of tyr and phe and altering inactivation properties, we
demonstrate that the position of aromatic residues along the s6 ␣
helix and not inactivation per se is the main determinant of herg
and eag channel sensitivity to block by  xxxd1708xxx .
materials and methods
molecular biology. site-directed mutagenesis was used to reposition

tyr and phe residues located in the s6 domain of herg and
drosophila eag channels by one position, either toward the n or c
terminus as shown in fig. 1. in each case an aromatic residue (e.g.,
phe-656 of herg) was replaced with an ala and a neighboring
residue (e.g., ile-655) mutated to the aromatic residue that was
mutated to ala. the resulting mutant channel was named according to whether the aromatic residue was transferred in the nterminal (‘‘up’’) or c-terminal (‘‘down’’) direction (fig. 1c). for
example, i655f兾f656a herg was named herg兾f-up. a similar approach was used to construct and name several mutant
herg channels (fig. 1a) and eag channels (fig. 1b). in addition,
mutant eag channels were constructed that contained a shift in both
aromatic residues, either both in the n-terminal direction or
c-terminal direction as illustrated in fig. 1b.
drosophila eag cdna was cloned in pgh19, kindly provided
by jeff warmke (merck research labs), and herg cdnas
were ligated into the psp64 vector. mutations were introduced
as described (15). the constructs were linearized, then transcribed with t7 (eag) or sp6 (herg) polymerase by using
capscribe (roche) to make crna that was injected into xenopus laevis oocytes as described (16).

techniques (17) were used to record currents in oocytes 1–3 d after

in each batch of oocytes. this current averaged 50 na and was

channels are resistant to herg blockers such as dofetilide and

 xxxd1708xxx  caused ⬎90% block of herg but only a 20% reduction
in eag current (fig. 3a). the wt eag channel current was 120-fold
less sensitive to block by  xxxd1708xxx  (ic50 ⫽ 11.9 ⫾ 1.2 ␮m, n ⫽ 4)
compared to wt herg. tyr-481 and phe-485 of eag are homologous to tyr-652 and phe-656 of herg (fig. 1b). as was done for
herg, we shifted the location of each aromatic residue of the eag
s6 domain in either the n-terminal (‘‘up’’) or c-terminal (‘‘down’’)
direction and tested the sensitivity of the resultant mutant channels
to block by 3 ␮m  xxxd1708xxx . transfer of either tyr-481 or phe-485
in the n-terminal direction (y-up or f-up) only slightly increased
drug block (fig. 3 b and c). in contrast, transfer of either residue in
the c-terminal direction (y-down, f-down) induced inactivation
and had a more dramatic effect on sensitivity to  xxxd1708xxx  (fig. 3 d
and e). the ic50 for eag兾y-down and eag兾f-down channels was
decreased by 43- and 10-fold, respectively (fig. 3h). we next
determined whether shifting the position of both residues, either up
or down the ␣-helix of s6 influenced channel block by  xxxd1708xxx .
eag兾yf-up channels (fig. 1b) gated normally but current was
unaffected by 3 ␮m (fig. 3f ) and only reduced 11% by 30 ␮m

eag channels to  xxxd1708xxx . the concentration-dependent block of wt
and mutant eag channels is summarized in fig. 3h. in summary,
shifting tyr-481 to the 482 position greatly increased drug sensitivity whereas the additional mutations used to transfer phe-485 to
the -486 position greatly reduced drug sensitivity of eag channels.

position of aromatic residues versus inactivation in eag channels.

the wt eag channels do not inactivate and are only poorly
blocked by  xxxd1708xxx  and dofetilide. ficker et al. (13) demonstrated that mutation-induced inactivation of eag channels
greatly enhanced drug block by dofetilide. the increased sensitivity of eag兾y-down and eag兾f-down channels to  xxxd1708xxx 
could be caused by repositioning of the aromatic residues, or to
preferential binding of drug to inactivated channels. therefore,
the voltage dependence of inactivation for each mutant channel
was determined with a two-pulse protocol from a holding
potential of ⫺80 mv. a 3.4-s prepulse was applied in 10-mv
increments, followed by a test pulse to either 0 or ⫹20 mv (fig.
4a). because most f-down channels were inactivated at a holding
potential of ⫺80 mv, the prepulse potential (vpre) was varied
from ⫺180 to ⫺90 mv. membrane hyperpolarization elicited a
slow inward current as channels recovered from inactivation.
subsequent depolarization to a test potential (vt) of 0 mv
induced inactivation of channels that were opened during the
hyperpolarizing prepulse (fig. 4a). the one-half point for inactivation (v1/2) determined with this pulse protocol was ⫺134 mv
(fig. 4g, 䡺), and ⬎95% of channels were inactivated at ⫺90 mv.
eag兾y-down channels exhibited less pronounced inactivation.
to estimate the voltage dependence of inactivation for eag兾ydown channels, the prepulse was varied from ⫺140 to ⫹10 mv
and the test pulse was applied to ⫹20 mv (fig. 4b). the v1/2 for
eag兾y-down channel inactivation was ⫺69 mv, and minimal
channel availability was 0.56 (fig. 4g, f). contrary to the
predicted correlation between inactivation and drug block,
eag兾f-down channels exhibited more inactivation but were less
sensitive to block by  xxxd1708xxx  (ic50 ⫽ 1.23 ␮m) compared to
eag兾y-down channels (ic50 ⫽ 0.28 ␮m).
other point mutations were introduced into the s6 domain to

herg was blocked in a concentration-dependent manner as
illustrated for 30–300 nm of drug in fig. 2b. the ic50 for block of
wt herg by  xxxd1708xxx  was 102 ⫾ 1 nm (n ⫽ 4; fig. 2f, f).
we hypothesized that the positions of tyr-652 and phe-656 in the
s6 domain of herg are optimal for high-affinity block. to test this
idea, we shifted the position of an aromatic residue in either the
n-terminal (‘‘up’’) or c-terminal (‘‘down’’) direction (fig. 1a) and
tested the sensitivity of the resultant mutant channels to block by
 xxxd1708xxx . m651y兾y652a channels (herg兾y-up, fig. 2c) deactivated faster than wt herg but were relatively resistant to 10 ␮m

deactivated slower than wt herg and were less sensitive to
 xxxd1708xxx  (fig. 2e). the slow deactivation prevented complete
closure of channels during the interpulse interval, observed as a
transient outward current at the beginning of each pulse to 0 mv
because of inactivation of open channels. the ic50 for block of
herg兾f-up channels by  xxxd1708xxx  was 1.60 ⫾ 0.11 ␮m (n ⫽ 4),
⬇16-fold less than wt herg (fig. 2f ). this altered sensitivity to
 xxxd1708xxx  was not caused by altered voltage dependence of inactivation (fig. 2g). these data suggest that position of the two aromatic
residues in s6 affect the sensitivity of herg to block by  xxxd1708xxx .
the finding that herg兾f-up channels were less sensitive to block
but had similar inactivation properties compared to wt herg
indicates that inactivation is not the only determinant of highaffinity block. however, because herg兾y-down did not express
and herg兾y-up and herg兾f-down channels had dramatically
altered gating properties, we could not make definitive conclusions
regarding the importance of tyr and phe positioning in s6 and
block of herg channels by  xxxd1708xxx . to explore the relative roles
of inactivation and aromatic residue positioning, we performed
similar experiments on the eag channel.

the mutation of ala-477 to gly slowed the rate of channel
activation but did not induce inactivation (fig. 4c). in contrast,
mutation of ala-478 to gly introduced substantial voltagedependent inactivation (fig. 4d) with a v1/2 of ⫺45 mv and a
minimal channel availability of 0.25 (fig. 4g). introduction of the
a477g or a478g mutation into eag兾y-down channels further
modulated the properties of inactivation. eag兾a477g兾y-down
channels inactivated similar to y-down (fig. 4 e and g), whereas
eag兾a478g兾y-down channels did not inactivate (fig. 4f ).
the concentration-dependent block by  xxxd1708xxx  of the mutant
channels shown in fig. 4 is summarized in fig. 5a. despite
differences in inactivation properties, the ic50 for block by
 xxxd1708xxx  of y-down, a477g兾y-down and a478g兾y-down eag
channels was similar and all were more sensitive to the drug
compared to wt eag. the ic50 values for wt eag and the six
mutant channels were plotted as a function of percentage
inactivation in fig. 5b. there was no correlation between drug
block and inactivation. this finding suggests that positioning of
the aromatic residues in the ␣-helix of the s6 domain of eag
channels is more important than inactivation in determining
sensitivity to block by  xxxd1708xxx . thus, although inactivation can
facilitate block of herg or eag channels, it is not sufficient or
required for block.
discussion
drug-induced lqts was described long ago (reviewed in refs. 19
and 20) but only recently commonly attributed to block of herg

k⫹ channels. this recognition has prompted preclinical testing of
drugs in development for potential block of heterologously expressed herg channels or ikr in isolated cardiac myocytes (21).
understanding the molecular determinants of drug binding to
herg channels is important for design of new drugs devoid of this
unwanted side effect. toward this goal, previous studies defined the
putative drug-binding site by using a site-directed mutagenesis
approach (7, 8). unlike other voltage-gated k⫹ channels, the s6
domain of herg subunits has two aromatic residues (tyr-652 and
phe-656) that face the central cavity of the channel. mutation of
either residue greatly reduced the affinity for block by mk-499,
dofetilide,  xxxd1708xxx , terfenadine, quinidine, and chloroquine (7–9),
suggesting that these aromatic residues comprise crucial components of the binding site for structurally diverse drugs.
block of herg also seems to be state-dependent. for most
of the compounds investigated, block only occurs after the
channel has opened. moreover, an obligatory link between
herg channel inactivation and high-affinity drug binding has
been suggested (11–14, 22). the most compelling evidence was
the observation that noninactivating eag channels were insensitive to dofetilide despite having a tyr and phe located in
positions equivalent to tyr-652 and phe-656 of herg. second,
a combination of point mutations that induced inactivation of
eag (t432s兾a443s兾a453s) also induced sensitivity to blockers
such as dofetilide (13). third, reduction of steady-state inactivation caused by removal of extracellular [na⫹] or addition of
cd2⫹ also reduced drug block of herg (22). however, several
exceptions to the correlation between inactivation and potency
of block have been noted. some mutations of herg (e.g.,
g648a, t623a, and f656a) enhanced inactivation but reduced
block by mk-499 (8). these mutations might directly or allosterically reduce the affinity of the drug-binding site. furthermore, removal of inactivation by mutagenesis does not always
result in lowered drug potency. for example, g628c兾s631c
herg channels do not inactivate (23), yet compared to wt
herg are only ⬇10-fold less sensitive to block by mk-499 (24)
and equally sensitive to disopyramide (25). v625a herg
channels do not appreciably inactivate but are blocked by
terfenadine and  xxxd1708xxx  at concentrations similar to that
required to block wt herg channels (8). some, but certainly not
all of the discrepancies between inactivation and block of mutant
herg channels might be explained by differences in voltage
pulse protocols or because specific mutations might alter the
drug-binding site in addition to enhancing inactivation. in this
chen et al.

study, we engineered mutations into herg and eag channels to
determine whether enhanced drug sensitivity could be accounted for by a repositioning of aromatic residues in the s6
domain rather than the gating associated with inactivation per se.
voltage-dependent rearrangements of the s6 domain appear to
mediate opening of kv channels. recent studies of bacterial kcsa
and mthk channels suggest that the inner helices, equivalent to the
s6 ␣-helical domains of kv channels, either rotate and translate
outward (26, 27), or bend ⬇30° away from the central cavity at a
kink in the ␣-helix located at a conserved gly residue (28, 29).
either opening mechanism would widen the diameter of the narrow
region formed by crisscrossing of the s6 domains near their
c-terminal ends of channels in the closed state. this movement
would enable large drugs like  xxxd1708xxx  to gain access to its binding
site within the inner pore of herg. less is known about the
protein rearrangements that accompany c-type inactivation. mutations of many residues in the pore helix and s6 domain either
enhance or reduce inactivation of kv channels (30–32), suggesting
these domains participate in c-type inactivation. rotation or other
movements of s6 may accompany or induce inactivation of herg,
resulting in a reorientation of the residues that line the central cavity
of the open or closed sate. an inactivation-associated reorientation
of tyr-652 and phe-656 to positions that favor drug binding could
explain the commonly observed link between inactivation and drug
sensitivity of herg channels (13).
to test the importance of positioning of s6 domain aromatic
residues in herg channels, we mutated tyr-652 to ala and one
of the neighboring residues to tyr. a similar mutation scheme was
used to move phe-656 of herg or tyr-481 and phe-485 of eag by
one position up or down the s6 ␣-helix. the mutant herg
channels were less sensitive to block by  xxxd1708xxx , but altered gating
properties prevent clear interpretation of the findings. in contrast,
repositioning of tyr-481 or phe-485 of eag channels enhanced
sensitivity to  xxxd1708xxx . eag兾y-down channels were 43-fold more
sensitive and f-down channels were 10-fold more sensitive than wt
eag channels. like the herg mutants, interpretation of these
results was complicated because these mutations also altered gating
properties. however, eag兾f-down channels inactivated ⬎95% at 0
mv, whereas eag兾y-down channels were ⬍50% inactivated at this
potential. these data suggest that repositioning of the aromatic
residues was a more important determinant of  xxxd1708xxx  block than
inactivation. most revealing was the finding that eag兾a478g兾ydown channels did not inactivate but retained the same sensitivity
to  xxxd1708xxx  as the inactivating eag兾y-down channel. herg兾fdown, eag兾f-down, and eag兾yf-down channels were constitutively open. repositioning the bulky phe down (but not up) one
position in the ␣-helix of s6 of herg or eag apparently disrupted
closure of the activation gate. the inability to close and trap the
drug within the central cavity could explain the reduced drug
sensitivity of herg兾f-down and eag兾yf-down channels. taken
together, our findings indicate that inactivation facilitates drug
binding to eag, but this gating is neither sufficient nor required for
high-affinity channel block.
there are several limitations of our study. first, repositioning of
a single aromatic residue in herg or eag required two mutations

per subunit, resulting in eight mutations per tetrameric channel.
most mutations altered gating properties as well as sensitivity to
 xxxd1708xxx , making it difficult to determine the difference between
a direct and an allosteric effect on drug interaction. second,
mutations in eag that induce sensitivity to  xxxd1708xxx  may not confer
sensitivity to other herg blockers. for example, we found that
sensitivity to mk-499 was not induced by the a478g兾y-down
mutations in eag (data not shown), even though mk-499, like
 xxxd1708xxx , interacts with tyr-652 and phe-656 (ref). however,
unlike  xxxd1708xxx , mk-499 also interacts with residues located at the
base of the pore helix (thr-623, ser-624, and val-625) and the
nearby gly-648 located in the s6 domain of herg. thus, although
we were able to enhance the sensitivity of eag channels to  xxxd1708xxx 
by transferring tyr from position 451 to 452, such a repositioning
would likely disturb the interaction of mk-499 with residues near
the pore helix. our findings suggest that orientation of s6 aromatic
residues with respect to the central cavity of herg channels differs
from eag channels. the positioning of tyr-652 and phe-656 in open
or inactivated herg channels may facilitate high-affinity interaction with many drugs, whereas tyr-451 and phe-455 of open eag
channels do not.
based on our mutant channel analyses, the tyr and phe of open
wt eag channels may be located above (toward the n-terminal end)
the optimal position for  xxxd1708xxx  binding. the opening of k⫹
channels is facilitated by a gating hinge in the s6 domain formed by
a conserved gly. five residues c-terminal to this gly is a conserved
ala or gly that faces the pore in kcsa and mthk channels. it was
proposed that a large side chain at this residue would plug the pore
and interfere with ion conductance (29). consistent with this
model, we found that mutation of this ala to a tyr in herg
(herg兾y-down) caused loss of function. however, eag兾y-down
channels with the equivalent mutations retained the ability to
conduct k⫹. the different functional consequences of the ala to
tyr mutations in eag and herg provide further circumstantial
evidence that equivalent residues based on sequence alignment can
have dissimilar orientation of their side groups relative to the
central cavity. the finding that rotating the position of tyr-451 on
the s6 ␣-helix by 100° induces drug sensitivity suggests, albeit
indirectly, that gating-associated rotation of s6 differs between eag
and herg, or that the residues in s6 are not positioned relative to
the central cavity in an identical manner as predicted simply by
sequence alignment. our experimental approach cannot distinguish between these two possibilities. we conclude that reduced
drug affinity of noninactivating herg mutant channels and the
increased drug affinity of inactivating eag channels are not due to
inactivation, per se, but to inactivation gating-associated reorientation of residues in the s6 domain that comprise a high-affinity
drug-binding site. analogous gating-associated reorientation of
residues in the s6 domain might explain enhanced binding and
block of na⫹ or ca2⫹ channels by many drugs (33, 34).
