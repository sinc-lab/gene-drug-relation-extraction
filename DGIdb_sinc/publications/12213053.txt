a series of  xxxd2546xxx  (2) and homomazindol (3) analogues with a variety of electron-donating
and electron-withdrawing groups in the pendant aryl group and the benzo ring c, as well as
h, methoxy, and alkyl groups replacing the hydroxyl group were synthesized, and their binding
affinities at the  xxxg2149xxx  (dat) on rat or guinea pig striatal membranes were
determined. several active analogues were also evaluated for their ability to block uptake of
da, 5-ht, and ne and inhibit binding of [125i] rti-55 at hek-hdat, hek- xxxg2150xxx , and hekhnet cells. mazindane (26) was found to be a pro-drug, oxidizing (5-h f 5-oh) to  xxxd2546xxx 
on rat striatal membranes and hek-hdat cells. the 4′,7,8-trichloro analogue (38) of  xxxd2546xxx 
was the most potent and selective ligand for hek-hdat cells (dat ki ) 1.1 nm; sert/dat
) 1283 and net/dat ) 38). experimental results strongly favor the cyclic or ol tautomers of
2 and 3 to bind more tightly at the dat than the corresponding keto tautomers.
introduction
r-cocaine (1a), a potent stimulant, is a major drug
of abuse and has contributed directly or indirectly to
many severe medical and social problems in the united
states.1 the majority of evidence in animal and human
studies provide support that the reinforcing and other
behavioral effects caused by r-cocaine are related to its
binding to a site at the  xxxg2149xxx  (dat),2
with possible contribution due to interaction at the
serotonin transporter (sert).3 the action of cocaine at
the dat inhibits the uptake of dopamine (da) into
presynaptic axon terminals and gives rise to an increase
of extracellular da that is thought to be the primary
mediator involved in the reinforcing effect of cocaine.2
the search for substances that block the binding site
of cocaine at the dat, to prevent its reinforcing and
behavioral properties, has resulted in the identification
of several series of diverse compounds.4 a number of
potent dat uptake inhibitors have one or two phenyl
or substituted phenyl groups attached directly or distal
to a heterocycle containing one or two n-atoms or an
o-atom. examples of this group of compounds are
cocaine-like analogues,5 beta-aryltropanes,6 piperdine analogues of cocaine,7 benztropines,8 gbr12909 analogues,9
methylphenidate,10 and  xxxd2546xxx  (2). recently, phenylbicyclo [2.2.2]-octane11 and phenylindane12 compounds

with an n-atom attached to the carbon ring and nonnitrogen analogues13 (bicyclo-[3.2.1]-octanes) of win
35,428 (1b) have also been reported to be potent dat
uptake inhibitors.
our laboratory has focused on  xxxd2546xxx  (2), a substance developed as an appetite suppressant,14 as a
starting point to develop a selective inhibitor of cocaine
binding because of its ability to inhibit binding of [3h]
cocaine (1a), [3h] win 35,428 (1b), and [3h] rti-55 to
the dat in nanomolar range.15 in clinical studies,
 xxxd2546xxx  abuse in humans16 is rare, and it has been
found to be of possible use in preventing relapse in
methadone-maintained cocaine abusers.17 we have
reported on structure-activity relationship (sar) of
analogues containing one or more halogen atoms (f, cl,
br, i) in ring c or the pendant aryl group (d), six (3;
homomazindol), and seven-membered ring a derivatives,18 and structural modification of the carbonyl group
of the benzophenone keto tautomer of  xxxd2546xxx  that
exists in strong acidic media19 (figure 1).
this paper describes sar studies where (a) the
pendant aryl group (ring d) in  xxxd2546xxx  (2) and homomazindol (3) is substituted in the 3′- and 4′-positions
by groups other than halogen atoms and also replaced
by 2-, 3-, or 4-pyridyl, (b) ring c of  xxxd2546xxx  contains
substituents in positions 6-9, and (c) the oh of  xxxd2546xxx  or homomazindol is replaced by an h, alkyl, or
alkoxy group. in addition, evidence is presented that
the carbinolamine or cyclic ol tautomer of  xxxd2546xxx  (m
in figure 1) is the active tautomer that interacts at the

chemistry
the synthesis of the novel racemic  xxxd2546xxx  and
homomazindol analogues in tables 1 and 2 is given in
schemes 1-4. no attempt was made to resolve  xxxd2546xxx 
or any of its analogues because of their potential to form
the keto tautomer (figure 1), thereby destroying the
chiral center.
preparation of the n,o-dilithio derivative of 2-phenyl4,5-dihydro-1h-imidazoline by a previously reported20
procedure and treatment with the appropriate methyl
benzoate or methylpyridylcarboxylate gave 4, 7, 8, 11,
16, 18, 20, and 21 and 23 and 24, respectively (scheme
1). compounds 4, 7, 8, 23, and 24 were established to

houlihan et al.

exist in the ol tautomer form in d6-dmso by the
presence of a 13c nmr signal between 87.6 and 88.9
ppm which is characteristic of the c-5 atom and lack of
a signal in the 194-196 ppm region, which is the
c-atom of the carbonyl group in the keto tautomer. the
compounds containing one (11), two (16, 18, or 20), or
three (21) groups with oxygen atoms connected directly
to the benzene ring gave 13c nmr signals characteristic
of the c-5 and carbonyl group, indicating the presence
of both tautomeric forms. the amount of each tautomer
was estimated to be 50:50 for the 3′,4′-(och3)2 (16) and
3′,4′,5′-(och3)3 (21) derivatives and 60:40 ol to keto for
the 3′,4′-methylene- (18) and ethylenedioxy (20) derivatives by comparing the ratio of 1h nmr signals of the
four h-atoms in their respective imidazoline rings and
55:45 ol to keto for the 4′-och3 (11) by comparing the
ratio of ch3 signals.
the pyrimidino [2,1-a]-isoindols 15 and 17 were
obtained by treating the n,o-dilithio derivative of 2-phenyl-1,4,5,6-tetrahydropyrimidine with a methyl benzoate,
and compounds 12, 13, 14, and 19 were prepared by
reacting the grignard reagent of 4-r-bromobenzene
with 3,4-dihydropyrimido-[2,1-a]-isoindole-6(2h)-one in
refluxing thf. the 4′-oh derivative 10 was obtained
by removal of the benzyl group in 15 by catalytic
hydrogenation (scheme 2). the 13c nmr spectra of
these compounds gave a c-6 atom signal at 91.34-91.99
ppm for those isolated as a free base (10, 12, 14, 15,
and 17) and 95.57 and 93.1 ppm for those existing as
hcl salts (13 and 19) and failed to display any signals in the carbonyl region. these findings indicate
that the pyrimido-[2,1-a]-isoindol-6-ols exist in the ol
form in both the free base and hcl salt forms (figure
1, hm-p).
preparation of 5h- xxxd2546xxx  (26; mazindane) was
accomplished by condensing ketoaldehyde 25 with 1,2diaminoethane in refluxing xylenes by the procedure21
used to prepare the 5-phenyl analogue. compound 26
was isolated as the sulfate salt because, like the
5-phenyl analogue, the free base was found to oxidize
at c-5 to  xxxd2546xxx  on prolonged contact with air.
alkylation of the sodium salt of the ethoxyisoindoline
27 with bromomethyl methyl ether gave 28b. heating
the known 28a22 and 28b with 3-aminopropanol gave
3-hydroxypropylamines 29a and 29b. when these were
treated with the i2/(c6h5)3 p complex in the presence
of imidazole, the resultant 3-iodopropylamino intermediates cyclized to 6-alkyl-homomazindols 30 and 31
(scheme 3).
the synthesis of the new ring c  xxxd2546xxx  analogues
39-45 is given in scheme 4. novel 2-arylimidazolines
were obtained by treatment of hydroxyamides 32a-32c,
prepared from the corresponding acid chlorides and
2-amino-2-methyl- xxxd3026xxx , with thionyl chloride in
toluene to form oxazolines 33a-33c. following the
procedure of chadwick,23 they were treated with iodomethane and the resultant n-methyl quaternary salts
34a-34c reacted with 1,2-diaminoethane in refluxing
acetonitrile to give 35e- xxxd1274xxx . preparation of the n,olithium salts of the 2-arylimidazolines from n-butyllithium in thf was carried out at room temperature
except for 35e, which was treated at 15 °c in order to
prevent dilithiation of its electron rich phenyl ring.

robenzoate gave 39-45. the 1h and 13c nmr spectra
of 39, 41, 42, 44, and 45 gave signals indicating the
presence of the ol tautomer, whereas the 6-methoxy
analogue 40 and 43 exist as a 75:25 and 85:15 mixture
of ol:keto tautomers.
the tendency of ring c analogues 40-43, which have
an oxygen connected directly to the benzene ring, to
exist in the keto tautomer is less than that for their ring
d analogues 11, 16, and 18. a possible explanation for
this trend is that much of the electron density supplied
by these groups is being directed to the electron
withdrawing imine portion of ring a, thereby favoring
the ol tautomer. with the ring d oxygen analogues, the
electron density can be more directed to the 5-position,
making that carbon atom more electron-rich and less
likely to interact with an electron-rich nitrogen atom
to form ring b of the ol tautomer.
previously reported18 ultraviolet spectra in neutral
(95% etoh) and acidic (ph 0.9: 95% etoh-2nhcl;
9:1) media indicated that halogenated  xxxd2546xxx  analogues exist as the carbinolamine in neutral media
and as the benzophenone tautomer in strong acidic
media. one exception is the 2′-bromo analogue that
exists as the carbinolamine form in both neutral and
acidic media. the halogenated homomazindols also
exist as the carbinolamine in both neutral and strong
acidic media. the present findings that  xxxd2546xxx  analogues can also exist in the benzophenone form in
neutral media (dmso) and several homomazindol
hydrochloride salts exist as carbinolamines leads to a
more complex equilibrium (figure 1). x-ray crystal

analysis of the 5-(3-iodophenyl) analog24a and the
hbr salt of the 5-phenyl analog24b (2b) confirm the
existence of the ol (m) and keto (m-p) forms in the solid
state. other possible forms of  xxxd2546xxx  and homomazindol include the previously proposed25a diprotonated keto form (m-p2) and the protonated amidine
forms  xxxd2579xxx  and hm-a, which are present in h2o due to
their pka values (8.55 ( 0.05 for mazindol25a) and can
also be present under the proper conditions, given in

from solid-state ir studies, have not been included in

and 2 were tested for their ability to displace [3h] win
35,428 (1b) from the dat of rat or guinea pig striatal
membranes.26 those found to have similar or greater
activity than  xxxd2546xxx  were evaluated for selectivity to
inhibit binding of [125i] rti-55 (1c) and monamine

results and discussion
 xxxd2546xxx  series: ring d. interpretation of the [3h]
win 35,428 binding data (table 1) for the  xxxd2546xxx 
series is complicated because several of the compounds
(11, 16, 19, 20, and 21) most likely exist in the ol and
keto tautomers under the conditions (ph 7.40) that the
assay was carried out. for the purpose of sar analysis,
these compounds are discussed separately.

of the 4′-chlorophenyl group for a 2- (22), 3- (23), or

scheme 4a

the activity trend found with the 4′-oh (10) and 4′och3 (12) analogues are similar to that found in the
methylphenidate series where a 5-fold and 40-fold
loss of activity relative to the 4′-cl analogue was
reported.10b
tautomeric  xxxd2546xxx  series: ring d. a comparison of the inhibition of binding of [3h] win 35,428 by
 xxxd2546xxx  and homomazindol compounds containing the
same substituent(s) in position 4′ or 3′,4′ of the pendant
aryl group is given in table 3. in all examples the
homomazindol analogues were more active (1.5-103fold) than the corresponding mazindols. those  xxxd2546xxx 
compounds (4′-cl, 3′,4′-cl2) that exist in the ol form in
neutral media showed less difference (8.1- and 1.5-fold)
than the 4′-och3 (8-fold), 3′,4′-(och3)2 (100-fold), and
3′,4′-och2o (98-fold) derivatives that exist as a mixture
of ol and keto isomers. the greater activity of the
homomazindol analogues compared to the  xxxd2546xxx 
series can be explained by assuming that the ol tautomer interacts more strongly than the keto (figure 1)
at the win 35,428 binding site. the very weak binding
displayed by the 3′,4′-ethylenedioxy (20) and 3′,4′,5′trimethoxy (21) analogues can also be explained by the
presence of a large amount (40% and 50%) of keto
tautomer.
 xxxd2546xxx  series: ring c. when the 4′-cl in ring
d of  xxxd2546xxx  is removed and placed in either the 6 (36)
or 7 (37) position of ring c, a 7- and 11-fold loss of
activity occurred. if these are compared with the unsubstituted ring d analogue 2b, the presence of a 6- or
7-cl had no effect. addition of two cl atoms (38) at
positions 7, 8 of  xxxd2546xxx  resulted in a slight loss
(0.3-fold) loss in activity. a flourine added to position 9
(39) of  xxxd2546xxx  gave a 3.5-fold increase in activity
(table 2).
placement of a methoxy group in position 6 (40), 7
(41), or 9 (42) of  xxxd2546xxx  resulted in a small loss of
activity (0.3-fold) for the 6-isomer and a 3- and 9-fold
increase in activity for the 7- and 9-isomers, respectively. this is an interesting activity change when
compared to the 6- and 7-chlorine isomers. for the cl
compounds, the 6-isomer was more active (1.5×) than
the 7-isomer, whereas the 7-methoxy isomer was more
active (5.0×) than the 6-isomer. this difference between
the cl and methoxy isomers is most likely caused by
the 6-methoxy isomer existing partly (25%) in the keto
form, while the 6-cl is in the ol form. the large loss
(8-fold) in activity that occurs with the 6,7-methylenedioxy derivative (43) of  xxxd2546xxx  is most likely due to
its partial existence (15%) in the keto form and possible
h-bonding with the c-5 hydroxyl group.
the addition of methyl groups at positions 6 and 8
(44) resulted in a small loss (0.35-fold) in activity, while
the presence of a phenyl at position 9 (45) gave a 9-fold
loss of activity relative to  xxxd2546xxx .
replacement of oh group. the methoxy analogue
of  xxxd2546xxx  2c was less potent (125×) than  xxxd2546xxx 
and mazindane (26), the 5h-analogue, was 1.4× more
potent in blocking the binding of win (table 2). the

similar trend in loss of activity (1.5-11-fold) compared
to the 4′-cl derivative.
the large drop in activity (57-fold) with the 2′-pyridyl
isomer 22 relative to the 4′-pyridyl (24) mimics the
“ortho effect” seen when a halogen (f, cl, br) is placed
in the 2′ or ortho position of the pendant aryl group in
 xxxd2546xxx .18 this suggests that electronic factors, as well
as substituent size, play a role in the “ortho effect” seen
in the  xxxd2546xxx  and other classes of da uptake inhibitors that have free rotating aryl groups.18 a second
possible explanation for the large loss in activity with
the 2-pyridyl analogue is the formation of an h-bond
between the oh and the 2-pyridyl n-atom, making the
oh less available for interaction at the win binding
site (figure 3).
homomazindol series: ring d. in the homomazindol series, replacement of the 4′-cl by an oh (10)
group led to ca. 3.5-fold loss of activity. the methoxy
analogue 12 showed a slight increase but was still 2.5fold weaker. increasing the size and electron density to
an alloxy (14) or benzyloxy (15) or transferring the
allyloxy group to the 3′-position (13) led to further loss
of activity, with maximum loss (100-fold) occurring with
the benzyloxy analogue. addition of a second och3
group at the 3′-position (17) of 12 resulted in an 87-fold
loss of activity, while the methlyenedioxy 19 was ca.
2-4-fold more active than homomazindol (3).

to determine if mazindane was oxidized by air under
the condition of the binding assay (ph 7.4), the sulfate salt was dissolved in dmso, dmso/h2o (1:1), or
tris-nacl buffer (ph 7.4) and then exposed to air at
ambient temperature for 48 h. analysis of the samples
by lc-uv-ms showed only the presence of mazindane.
mazindane sulfate was then tested at a high dose (10-6
m) under regular assay conditions ([3h] win 35,428
excluded). the rat striatal membranes from the assay
were immediately washed with dmf and the filtrate
freeze-dried. only  xxxd2546xxx  was detected in the residue
by the lc-uv-ms procedure, indicating that mazindane is rapidly oxidized at c-5 by an oxidase or monooxygenase present in the rat striatal membranes.
in summary, replacement of the 4′-cl in ring d of
 xxxd2546xxx  (2) by a variety of functional groups (table 1)
failed to increase its ability to inhibit win binding at
the dat, while in the homomazindol (3) series, only the
3′,4′-methylenedioxy group (19) gave a 2-4-fold increase
of activity. the reason the oxygen containing analogues
11, 16, 18, 20, and 21 caused such large decreases in
activity is most likely due to the presence of significant
amounts of the keto tautomer (figure 1: m-keto).
in ring c, placement of small electronegative group
(f, och3) at position 9 resulted in compounds (39 and
42) that were more effective than  xxxd2546xxx  in inhibiting
win binding at the dat.
selectivity and discrimination. selectivity and
discrimination on nine of the most active inhibitors of

win binding was determined by measuring their ability
to displace [125i] rti-55 binding and block the uptake
of da, ne, and 5-ht at the dat, sert, and net of
hek cells expressing cdna for the human transporter
(tables 4 and 5).
all of these compounds, except 10, were more potent
(1.2-41-fold) than  xxxd2546xxx  in blocking rti binding at
the dat, but only the 4′,7,8-trichloromazindol analogue
38 (ki ) 1.1 nm) was equal to homomazindol. no
correlation was found between the order of binding
activity on rat striatal membranes (tables 1 and 2) and
hek-hdat cells (table 4). weaker (1-46-fold) affinity
for binding at  xxxg2150xxx  was observed for all compounds
except 19 and 26, which were 1.5× and 1.9× more
potent than homomazindol and  xxxd2546xxx  respectively,
while at the hnet, 19 and 39 were more effective, 2.0
and 20-fold, in binding than  xxxd2546xxx  or homomazindol,
respectively.
several of the compounds displayed a greater selectivity for binding at the hdat over the  xxxg2150xxx  (38, 40,
41, 42) or hnet (38, 42). the most selective, at both
the  xxxg2150xxx  and hnet, was 38 with 1160× and 56×
more selectivity over the  xxxg2150xxx  and 95× and 3.6×
more selectivity over the hnet than  xxxd2546xxx  and
homomazindol, respectively.
as a group, the compounds were more active as
inhibitors of ne uptake, followed by inhibition of da
uptake, and weakest at inhibiting 5-ht uptake (table
5). the most active uptake inhibitor of both da and ne

 xxxd2546xxx  analogues as potential inhibitors

was 19 with ic50 values of 2.21 and 0.62 nm, respectively. compound 26 showed the best activity at inhibiting 5-ht uptake with ic50 of 15 nm.
most of the compounds (38-42) gave better uptake/
binding (ki/ic50) discrimination ratios at the hdat than
 xxxd2546xxx  or homomazindol, with 42 showing the best
at 14.5 ki/ic50. discrimination ratios better than  xxxd2546xxx  or homomazindol at the  xxxg2150xxx  were found for 19,
39, and 40 while only 39 gave a better ki/ic50 ratio at
the hnet.
to determine if mazindane (26) had been oxidized to
 xxxd2546xxx  by the hek-hdat cells, it was assayed as in
the rat striatal membrane study. only  xxxd2546xxx  was
detected by the lc-uv-ms analysis, indicating that
oxidation had occurred. the variation in radioligand and
uptake inhibition seen with 2 and 26 (tables 2, 4 and
5) could be due to the oxidizing potential of the different
membranes and the duration and temperature of each
assay. a more likely explanation for the greater activity
of 26 in the win and rti binding and da uptake assays
is that some mazindane, as well as  xxxd2546xxx , may be
present during the assays and it is more active at the
dat. it is possible that any remaining mazindane was
not extracted by the dmf wash because of its high
affinity for the dat. the greater efficacy of mazindane
is possibly due to the presence of a h at c-5 which more
closely matches the structure of da, which has only
h-atoms on the r-c atom. the greater activity of
 xxxd2546xxx  in inhibiting binding and ne uptake at the
net could be due to the presence of an oh at c-5 that
more closely matches the structure of ne, which has
an oh on the r-c atom (figure 2).
interaction model. the earlier report18 from our
laboratory on halogenated  xxxd2546xxx  analogues as inhibitors of [3h] win 35,428 binding at the dat did not
allow a distinction as to whether the ol or keto form (m
and m-keto in figure 1) is the active structure at the
binding site because all the compounds evaluated
existed in the ol forms under the assay conditions of ph
7.4. the findings in this report that the  xxxd2546xxx  analogues 11, 16, 18, 20, 21, 40, and 43 that exist as a mixture of ol and keto tautomers in neutral media show a
considerable loss in activity relative to those that exist
in the ol form, and all homomazindols exist in the ol
form in neutral or acidic media, makes it likely that the
keto form has weaker interaction at the dat binding
site.
if the ol tautomer  xxxd2579xxx  of  xxxd2546xxx , present in
aqueous media, is further protonated by an acidic group,
such as the carboxyl on an  xxxd233xxx  unit of the dat,
it could possibly cause a shift to the protonated keto
forms m-p or m-p2 (figure 1). to determine if this
might occur, a uv study (220-330 nm) was carried out
on  xxxd2546xxx  in aqueous buffered media (table 6). the
ph range 1.5-8.0 was selected because it covers the ph
of the assay media and the various acidic binding sites
found at the dat. only the ol form  xxxd2579xxx  (272 nm
maximum) was found between ph 1.5 and 8.0.
two possible interaction models for the  xxxd2546xxx  ol
tautomer, which differ only in how the oh interacts at
the binding site, are given in figure 3. in the h-bond a
model, the h interacts with an electronegative atom x,
where x could be o, n, or s, and in the h-bond b model,
the o interacts with the h atom on x-h. no substantial

evidence is currently available to decide if the h-bond

a previous study29 of  xxxd2546xxx  and structural variants demonstrated the importance of the oh group at
c-5 in binding at human and drosophila melanogaster
serotonin transporters (serts), and young30 has completed a preliminary search for a common pharmacophore between cocaine (1a) and  xxxd2546xxx  using the
chem dbs_3d modules of chem-x. no correlation
was found with the keto form (figure 1) of  xxxd2546xxx ,
while both the r- and s-isomers showed two possible 3-point pharmacophore fits involving the imine n,
oh, and 3′-h or 4′-cl of  xxxd2546xxx  and the n, co2ch3,
c6h5co2, and phenyl of cocaine. these results complement our findings that the ol form of  xxxd2546xxx  most
likely interacts at the dat site where cocaine binds.
conclusions
mazindane (26) has been found to be a pro-drug,
oxidizing (5-h f 5-oh) to  xxxd2546xxx  (2) on both rat
striatal membranes and hek-hdat cells.
the 4′,7,8-trichloro analogue (38) of  xxxd2546xxx  was the
most potent and selective for binding at the dat over
the sert or net of any  xxxd2546xxx  or homomazindol
prepared to date.
experimental results strongly favor the cyclic or ol
tautomer m and hm rather than the keto form (m-keto
and hm-keto in figure 1), to bind more tightly at the
dat (figure 3).
additional in vivo studies to define their potential for
treatment of cocaine addiction have been completed for
mazindane31 and are on going for 38. sar studies to
define the effect of enhanced aliphatic and aromatic
lipophilicity have been completed32 and a three-dimensional quantitative structure-activity relationship
(3d-qsar) at the dat was carried out33 on the compounds in this and related papers.

[3h]-win 35,428 binding assays a. rat. brains from
male sprague-dawley rats (harlan labs) weighing 200-225
g were removed, striatum dissected, and quickly frozen.
membranes were prepared by homogenizing tissues in 20
volumes (w/v) of ice cold modified sucrose phosphate buffer
(0.32m sucrose, 7.74 mm na2hpo4, 2.26 mm nah2po4, ph
adjusted to 7.4) using a brinkman polytron (setting 6 for 20
s) and centrifuged at 20 000g for 10 min at 4 °c. the resulting
pellet was suspended in buffer, recentrifuged, and resuspended
in buffer to a concentration of 10 mg/ml. ligand binding
experiments were conducted in assay tubes containing 0.5 ml
sucrose phosphate buffer for 120 min on ice. each tube
contained 0.5 nm [3h] win 35,428 (specific activity 84 ci/
mmol) and 1.0 mg striatal tissue (original wet weight).
nonspecific binding was determined using 30 µm cocaine hcl.
incubations were terminated by rapid filtration through
whatman gf/b filters, presoaked in 0.05% pei (polyethylenimine), using a brandel r48 filtering manifold (brandel
instruments, gaithersburg, maryland). the filters were washed
twice with 5 ml cold buffer and transferred to scintillation
vials. beckman formula 964 (4.0 ml) was added, and the vials
were counted the next day using a beckman 6000 liquid
scintillation counter (beckman coulter instruments, fullerton,
california). data were analyzed by using ebda software.

were incubated with 50 mm tris-nacl (ph 7.4) containing
100 mm nacl at 25 °c for 2 h. the reaction assay was
terminated by rapid vacuum filtration onto glass fiber filters.
radioactivity trapped onto the fibers is determined and
compared to control values in order to ascertain any interaction
of test compound with the uptake site.
[125i] rti-55 binding assay. all test compounds were
prepared as 10 mm stock solution in dmso. subsequent
dilutions were made in assay buffer, achieving a final concentration of 0.1%. pipetting was conducted using a biomek 2000
robotic work station. hek293 cells expressing hdat,  xxxg2150xxx ,
or hnet inserts were grown to 80% confluence on 150 mm
diameter tissue culture dishes and serve as the tissue source.
the medium was poured off the plate, and the plate was
washed with 10 ml of calcium- and magnesium-free phosphate-buffered saline and lysis buffer (10 ml; 2 mm hepes
with 1 mm edta) was added. after 10 min, cells were scraped
from the plates, poured into centrifuge tubes, and centrifuged
30,000 x g for 20 min. the supernatant fluid was removed,
and the pellet was resuspended in 12-32 ml of 0.32 m sucrose
using a polytron at setting 7 for 10 s. the resuspension volume
depends on the density of binding sites within a cell line and
is chosen to reflect binding of 10% or less of the total radioactivity. each assay tube contained 50 µl of membrane prepara-

tion (about 10-15 µg of protein), 25 µl of test compound or
buffer (krebs-hepes, ph 7.4; 122 mm nacl, 2.5 mm cacl2,
1.2 mm  xxxd2534xxx , 10 µm  xxxd2850xxx , 100 µm tropolone, 0.2%
glucose and 0.02%  xxxd228xxx , buffered with 25 mm hepes),
25 µl of [125i] rti-55 (40-80 pm final concentration) and
additional buffer sufficient to bring the final volume to 250
µl. the membranes are preincubated with unknowns for 10
min prior to the addition of [125i] rti-55. the assay tubes were
incubated at 25 °c for 90 min, and the binding was terminated
by filtration over gf/c filters using a tomtec 96-well cell
harvester. filters are washed for 6 s with ice-cold saline.
scintillation fluid was added to each square and radioactivity
remaining on the filter was determined using a wallac µ- or
beta-plate reader. specific binding was defined as the difference
in binding observed in the presence and absence of 5 µm
 xxxd2546xxx  (hek-hdat and hek-hnet) or 5 µm imipramine
(hek- xxxg2150xxx ). two or three independent competition experiments were conducted with duplicate determinations. graphpad prism was used to analyze the ensuing data, with ic50
values converted to ki values using the cheng-prusoff equation. additional details about this assay have been published.40
inhibition of [3h] neurotransmitter uptake in hek293
cells expressing recombinant biogenic amine transporters. hek293 cells expressing hdat,  xxxg2150xxx , or hnet
were grown to confluence as described above. the medium was
removed, and the cells were washed twice with phosphate
buffered saline (pbs) at room temperature. following the
addition of krebs- hepes buffer (3 ml), the plates were
warmed in a 25 °c water bath for 5 min. the cells were gently
scraped and then triturated with a pipet. cells from multiple
plates were combined. one plate provides enough cells for 48
wells, which is required to generate data on two complete
curves for the test compounds. krebs-hepes (350 µl) and test
compounds (50 µl) were added to 1-ml vials and placed in a
25 °c water bath. specific uptake is defined as the difference
in uptake observed in the presence and absence of 5 µm imipramine (hek- xxxg2150xxx ). cells (50 µl) are added and preincubated with the unknowns for 10 min. the assay is initiated
by the addition of [3h] dopamine, [3h] serotonin, or [3h]
norepinephrine (50 µl, 20 nm final concentration). filtration
through whatman gf/c filters presoaked in 0.05% polyethylenimine is used to terminate uptake after 10 min. the ic50s
are calculated applying the graphpad prism program to
triplicate curves made up of 6 drug concentrations each. two
or three independent determinations of each curve are made.
