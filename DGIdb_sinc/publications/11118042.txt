abstract
both the sulfide and sulfone metabolites of  xxxd3259xxx , a nonsteroidal
anti-inflammatory drug, display anticarcinogenic effects in experimental
models.  xxxd3259xxx  sulfide inhibits cyclooxygenase (cox) enzyme activities
and has been reported to suppress ras-dependent signaling. however, the
mechanisms by which  xxxd3259xxx  sulfone suppresses cancer growth are not
as defined. we studied the effects of these  xxxd3259xxx  metabolites in human
colon cancer-derived caco-2 cells that have been transfected with an
activated  xxxg1285xxx  oncogene. stable transfected clones expressed high levels
of cox-2 mrna and protein, compared with parental cells. k-rastransfected cells formed tumors more quickly when injected into severe
combined immunodeficiency disease mice than parental cells, and this
tumorigenesis was suppressed by treatment with  xxxd3259xxx .  xxxd3259xxx  sulfone inhibited cox-2 protein expression, which resulted in a decrease in
prostaglandin synthase e2 production.  xxxd3259xxx  sulfide had little effect on
cox-2 in this model, but did suppress prostaglandin synthase e2 production, presumably by inhibiting cox enzyme activity. these data indicate
that the sulfide and sulfone derivatives of  xxxd3259xxx  exert cox-dependent
effects by distinct mechanisms.

the cox-2 message, which appeared to be modulated by the mapk
pathway (12). selective inhibition of the mapk kinase by  xxxd1169xxx 
caused a delay in cox-2 induction at both the mrna and the protein
levels. this suggests that the mapk signaling cascade may mediate
cox-2 expression.
 xxxd3259xxx  sulfide has been shown previously to bind ras to inhibit
the recruitment of raf to the plasma membrane and thus directly
inhibit ras signaling (13). in addition,  xxxd3259xxx  sulfone and certain
nsaids (i.e.,  xxxd2969xxx  and  xxxd3259xxx ) have been shown previously to
have a proportionately greater inhibitory effect on carcinomas harboring mutations in either k- or h-ras (14, 15). to determine whether
 xxxd3259xxx  sulfone can affect ras-dependent signaling, we investigated
the effect of this drug on the  xxxg1285xxx -dependent expression of cox-2 in
a human colon cancer-derived cell line.

 xxxd3259xxx  sulfone inhibits cox-2 expression

cox-1 and cox-2 antibodies were obtained from santa cruz biotechnology,
santa cruz, ca, and used at 1:250 and 1:5000 dilutions, respectively. all
western blots were repeated three times and a representative blot was chosen
for presentation.
northern blotting. rna was isolated from frozen cell pellets using
trizol:chloroform (5:1; life technologies, inc.) extractions. rna was further
purified in isopropanol and washed in 75% ethanol. rna was run out on a 1%
agarose/formaldehyde gel in mops [3-(n-morpholino)propanesulfonic acid]
buffer and transferred to nylon. the cox-2 cdna probe (oxford biomedical
research, inc., oxford, mi) was labeled using the rts radprime dna
labeling system (life technologies, inc.) and [␣32p]-dctp. the probe was
purified with g-50 sepharose columns (boehinger mannheim, indianapolis,
id) and quantitated with a scintillation counter. the membrane was hybridized
to the probe overnight at 42°c and then washed three times (2⫻ ssc0.1%sds for 5 min at room temperature, then for 20 min at room temperature,
and then 0.5⫻ ssc-0.1% sds for 30 min at 65°c). membranes were prehybridized again and then hybridized to  xxxg861xxx  (0.75 kb psti-xbai fragment) as a loading control. autoradiograms
were quantitated by densitometric analysis (imagequant; molecular dynamics, sunnyvale, ca).
pge2 production. cells were seeded 104/well on 96-well plates and
treated with drug or vehicle 24 h later. serum-free medium was supplemented
with 15 ␮m  xxxd208xxx  (sigma, st. louis, mo) after 24 h of drug
treatment for 1 h prior to medium collection for the pge2 kit (amersham,
arlington heights, il).
animal model. caco-2- or  xxxg1285xxx -activated caco-2 cells (clone 60) were
injected subdermally into four areas of the flank of scid mice at 1 ⫻ 106
cells/injection. there were three to four mice/group. the mice were fed 167
parts/million  xxxd3259xxx  in ain93g diet (teklad, indianapolis, in). the injection
sites were monitored once a week until tumors appeared; tumors were measured twice a week. the animals were sacrificed at 100 days because of tumor
burden.
statistics. assessment of statistical differences for figs. 3 and 4 were
determined by anova. a p ⬍0.05 was considered statistically significant.

results

fig. 1. characterization of  xxxg1285xxx -activated caco-2 cells. a, caco-2 parental cells (p)
and  xxxg1285xxx  transfectants ( xxxg1285xxx -overexpressing clones 60, 66, and 96) were tested for
normal and mutant alleles of  xxxg1285xxx  with the use of a pcr-rflp technique. pcr products
were digested with bstni; mutation at codon 12 prevents bstni cleavage. b, caco-2
parentals and  xxxg1285xxx -transfected clones were harvested at the indicated times and analyzed
for viable cell number as determined by dye exclusion. parentals (⽧), 60 (f), 66 (œ), 96
(f).

characterization of  xxxg1285xxx -activated clones. caco-2 cells were
used for stable transfection of p21val12  xxxg1285xxx  because they express
normal  xxxg1285xxx  (15). to better elucidate  xxxg1285xxx  overexpression, we used
a pcr-rflp technique to determine whether the transfectants overexpressed the normal or mutant alleles. we introduced a bstni restriction enzyme cut site using specific primers and then cut the pcr
product; the enzyme cuts if the cells are expressing the normal allele,
but it will not cut if the cells are expressing the mutant allele. the data
shows that the clones with the highest expression (transfected clone
numbers 60, 66, and 96) displayed both normal and mutant alleles,
whereas the parental cell line expressed only normal  xxxg1285xxx  (fig. 1a).
this shows that the transfected cells do indeed express the mutant
 xxxg1285xxx  gene but does not provide information regarding the level of the
normal or the mutant allele being expressed. because transfection
with h-ras changes the growth characteristics of caco-2 cells (18), we
examined the growth of the  xxxg1285xxx  transfectants and compared them
with the parental line. after 12 days in culture, there was no significant difference in growth kinetics between the parental cell line and
the  xxxg1285xxx -activated clones (fig. 1b). this may indicate that both
normal and mutant alleles are being overexpressed simultaneously in
the transfectants.
cox expression in  xxxg1285xxx -activated caco-2 cells. we measured
cox-2 protein and rna levels in the  xxxg1285xxx -activated clones and in
the parental caco-2 cell line. the level of cox-2 protein was increased in the  xxxg1285xxx -activated cells relative to the parental cell line,

 xxxd3259xxx  sulfone inhibits cox-2 expression

significantly inhibited pge2 production in  xxxg1285xxx -activated cells (data
not shown).  xxxd3259xxx  sulfone at 600 ␮m and sulfide at 120 ␮m
displayed similar inhibitory effects on prostaglandin synthesis (fig.
3c). in addition, sulfone significantly inhibited cox-2 protein (and
mrna, data not shown), whereas the sulfide at its ic50 dose did not
affect protein levels (fig. 3a). this finding suggests that the sulfone
can indirectly affect prostaglandin synthesis by affecting cox-2
protein expression. by contrast, an ic50 dose of  xxxd3259xxx  sulfide
suppresses pge2 levels, presumably by inhibiting cox enzyme activity, but does not affect cox-2 protein expression. this is the first
demonstration that  xxxd3259xxx  sulfone can exert cox-dependent effects
on cell behaviors, specifically by suppressing  xxxg1285xxx -dependent signaling of cox-2 protein expression.
 xxxd3259xxx  inhibited tumor formation in scid mice injected with
 xxxg1285xxx -activated caco-2 cells (fig. 4). caco-2 cells and the k-rasactivated transfectants showed no difference in growth characteristics
in vitro (fig. 1b) but displayed differences in tumor formation when
injected in immune-compromised mice.  xxxg1285xxx  activation caused an
increase in the rate of tumor formation over the nontransfected cell
line, and  xxxd3259xxx  greatly inhibited this tumorigenesis. measurable
tumors became apparent in untreated mice after 35 days, whereas
 xxxd3259xxx -treated mice did not present with tumors until after day 60.
by day 100,  xxxd3259xxx  had prevented tumor growth by 60% compared
with the control group.
discussion

fig. 3. effects of  xxxd3259xxx  sulfone on cox-2 expression and pge2 production. a,
western blot analysis of cox-2 in caco-2 cells and  xxxg1285xxx  transfectants.  xxxg1285xxx  transfectants were treated for 24 h with 120 ␮m sulfide or 600 ␮m sulfone. b, cox-2 protein
levels for  xxxg1285xxx -transfected caco-2 cells in the presence of 600 ␮m  xxxd3259xxx  sulfone on
days 2, 4, and 6. c, extracellular pge2 levels in caco-2 cells,  xxxg1285xxx  transfectants, and
 xxxg1285xxx  transfectants treated with 600 ␮m sulfone or 120 ␮m sulfide for 24 h. the vehicle
used was dmso. p for vehicle-treated cells compared with sulfone- or sulfide-treated
cells are p ⫽ 0.02 and p ⫽ 0.003, respectively.

but no difference was observed in cox-1 protein (fig. 2a). there is
a similar increase in cox-2 mrna levels in the  xxxg1285xxx -activated
clones (fig. 2b). this data suggests that an activated  xxxg1285xxx  increases
the expression of cox-2 mrna and protein. the increase in expression of cox-2 mrna and protein was transient, peaking at 2–3 days
in culture and decreasing over time (fig. 2b and 2c). this transient
effect is irrespective of  xxxg1285xxx  status, as would be expected because
cox-2 is an inducible rather than constitutive gene.
effects of  xxxd3259xxx  and its sulfide and sulfone metabolites on
cox-2 expression, pge2 production, and tumorigenesis. because  xxxg1285xxx -activated caco-2 cells exhibited an elevation in cox-2
mrna and protein, we expected to observe an increase in pge2
production in  xxxg1285xxx -transfected cells compared with the parental
caco-2 cells.  xxxg1285xxx -activated cells showed a 30% increase in pge2
synthesis over the parental cells (fig. 3c). pge2 production was next
measured in cells treated for 24 h with  xxxd3259xxx  and its sulfide and
sulfone metabolites at doses previously established to inhibit caco-2
colony formation by 50%. treatment with 400 ␮m  xxxd3259xxx  sulfoxide

the data presented here indicate that  xxxd3259xxx  and its sulfide and
sulfone metabolites inhibit tumorigenesis in colon-derived cells by at
least two distinct mechanisms. one mechanism involves the suppression of prostaglandin synthesis by cox-1 and/or cox-2 enzyme
activity (8). the second mechanism, shown here for the sulfone
metabolite, involves inhibition of the  xxxg1285xxx -dependent signaling of
genes affecting tumorigenesis.  xxxd3259xxx  sulfone has been shown to
affect the signaling pathways influencing the expression of genes
other than cox-2, as shown here. yamamoto et al. (19) have reported
that this drug inhibits nf-␬b activation in colon cancer and other cell
types. we have observed an increase in promoter activity in the
polyamine catabolic enzyme, spermidine/ xxxd3234xxx  n1-acetyltransferase when  xxxg1285xxx -activated caco-2 cells are treated with sulfone.4
these observations suggest that sulfone is acting to modulate the
 xxxg1285xxx -dependent signaling of a variety of genes influencing cellular
processes. recently, it has been reported that  xxxd3259xxx  sulfone affects
␤-catenin signaling by inhibition of  xxxd1274xxx -dependent phosphodiesterases and activation of protein kinase g (20).
nsaids are known to exert their effects by cox-dependent and
-independent mechanisms (21). cox-dependent mechanisms would
include those situations in which nsaids interact directly with cox
proteins to inhibit enzyme activity and those in which agents, such as
 xxxd3259xxx  sulfone, suppress cox protein expression. this latter mechanism does not involve direct enzyme/inhibitor interactions, but only
requires that formation of the target enzyme is prevented. coxindependent mechanisms could involve inhibition of signaling pathways affecting genes other than cox-1 or cox-2.
in the studies reported here, we compared the effects of ic50
concentrations of the sulfide (120 ␮m) and sulfone (600 ␮m) metabolites of  xxxd3259xxx  on the  xxxg1285xxx -dependent expression of cox-2. the
increased potency of  xxxd3259xxx  sulfide may reflect the ability of this
metabolite to both suppress cox enzyme activity and inhibit signaling, whereas  xxxd3259xxx  sulfone only inhibits signaling. this suggests

that higher concentrations of  xxxd3259xxx  sulfide may also inhibit the
signaling of cox-2 protein expression. hermann et al. (13) have
reported that  xxxd3259xxx  sulfide can bind to ras in cell-free studies.
future studies will address whether the sulfone directly binds to ras in
cells.
the reduction in pge2 in the  xxxd3259xxx -treated,  xxxg1285xxx -activated
caco-2 cells may be attributable to its effects on cox-1 or cox-2 or
both. the distinction cannot be made by measuring prostaglandin
levels. we hypothesize that  xxxd3259xxx  sulfone is acting to reduce
prostaglandin levels in our caco-2 model by a  xxxg1285xxx -dependent mechanism acting selectively on cox-2, compared with cox-1. we favor
this interpretation, because we observed no change in cox-1 protein
levels in the  xxxg1285xxx -activated cells (fig. 2a), and  xxxd3259xxx  sulfone does
not appear to affect cox-1 protein levels measured by western blot
(data not shown).
the data presented here provide additional evidence for the role of
cox-2 expression in colon carcinogenesis, where up to 50% of large
adenomas and adenocarcinomas contain activating mutations in  xxxg1285xxx 
(22). we showed that an activated  xxxg1285xxx  oncogene leads to an
up-regulation of cox-2 expression in human adenocarcinoma cells.
previous work has shown that activated h-ras leads to up-regulation
of cox-2 in rodent cells (12). however, h-ras is not expressed in
human colonic epithelium, whereas  xxxg1285xxx  mutations occur with high
frequency in colorectal cancers (⬃50%) and are found in nearly 100%
of pancreatic cancers (22–24).  xxxg1285xxx  has been shown to be the only
ras family member to be essential for development in mice (25). thus
it is possible that, in humans,  xxxg1285xxx  may have functions unique from
h-ras, as has been shown for mice (25).
this study describes a novel cox-dependent effect of the nsaid
 xxxd3259xxx , namely the inhibition of  xxxg1285xxx -dependent signaling of
cox-2 protein expression by the sulfone metabolite of this drug.
these data demonstrate that  xxxd3259xxx  can inhibit  xxxg1285xxx -dependent
colon tumorigenesis in this caco-2 cell model system. the mechanisms responsible for suppression of tumor formation may involve
both the direct inhibition of cox enzyme activity, by  xxxd3259xxx  sulfide,
and the suppression of signaling pathways, by  xxxd3259xxx  sulfone, affecting the expression of genes which are required for tumor growth.
