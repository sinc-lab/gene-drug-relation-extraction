ibii. n., m. ikeda, y. takahara, m. eigyo, t. akiyoshi and a. matsushita. inhibitory effect of  xxxd464xxx  on
haloperidol-induced catalepsy in rats. peptides 10(4) 779-783, 1989.-- xxxd464xxx  (clt: 160 la,g/kg, sc) produced a relatively
long-lasting inhibition of haloperidol (hpd: 2 mg/kg, po) catalepsy in rats. neither bilateral vagotomies nor hypophysectomy
abolished the anticataleptic effect of clt. however, (-)-l-364,718 and proglumide blocked the effect of clt. clt (160 i~g/kg)
significantly inhibited hpd (2 mg/kg)-induced increase in dopamine (da) release from the rat striatum. this effect of clt was also
antagonized by proglumide. these results suggest that clt (160 ~g/kg) primarily acts on cholecystokinin-a receptor in the brain,
exerts some modulatory influence on hpd binding to striatal da receptors via unknown neural pathways and, consequently, inhibits
hpd catalepsy.

catalepsy was estimated using the horizontal bar test 1,2, 3, 4,
5 and 7 hr after administration of hpd. rats were placed with both
forepaws on a 12- to 13-cm-high bar and the time up to 120 sec
was measured during which the animal maintained this position
with all parts of the body completely immobile (descent latency).
hpd at 2 mg/kg, po, or 0.3 mg/kg, sc, was used to induce the
catalepsy.
striatal dopamine (da) metabolism was examined using a
brain microdialysis method. the rats were anesthesized with ether
and placed in a stereotaxic apparatus with the incisor bar 5.0 mm
above the interaural line. a dialysis tube (molecular cut-off of
50,000, outer diameter of 200 v,m) was unilaterally implanted into
the striatum. the coordinates used were 8.0 mm anterior to the
vertical zero plane (the interaural line), 2.5 mm lateral to the
midline and 0.5 mm dorsal to the horizontal zero plane (21). after
at least 4 hr of recovery, the dialysis tube connected to the
microinfusion pump (cma/100, carnegie medicine ab, sweden)
via the fused silica tube (inner diameter of 50 la,m) was perfused
with  xxxd3213xxx  solution (na 147 mm, k 4 mm, ca 3.4 mm, ci
155.5 mm, ph 6.5) at a speed of !.0 ixl/min. twenty i~1 of the
dialysate, collected every 20 min, was directly injected into a
high-performance liquid chromatograph using an autoinjector
(eicom as-12, japan). the mobile phase consisted of 100 mm
kh2poa(ph 4.9) containing 3.7 mg/l na.2edta, 160 mg/l naoctanesulfonate and 20% (v/v) methanol, and the flow rate was
maintained at 1.0 ml/min. da, 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid
(dopac) and homovanillic acid (hva) were separated using a
reverse-phase column (yanapac ods-a, inner diameter 4.6 mm,
length 250 mm) and detected using a graphite electrode (eicom
cb-100). after stabilized spontaneous output of da and its
metabolites was obtained, the animals were given drugs. data
were expressed as a percent of the mean of the last three
measurements taken before drug application.

in 1985, it was reported that  xxxd464xxx  (clt), a cholecystokinin
(cck)-related decapeptide, markedly improved tardive dyskinesia
of a schizophrenic inpatient (19). subsequent open clinical studies
in japan also indicate that clt is effective against involuntary
movements of various etiology like tardive dyskinesia, huntington's chorea and tyemors, and that these effects of clt generally
last for a very long time (2, 11, 15, 16, 18, 20, 24, 26).
clt was found to inhibit the cage-biting behavior of rats
produced by bilateral, intranigral injections of bicuculline, apomorphine-induced contraversive rotation, reserpine rigidity and
harmaline tremor (1). however, these activities of clt were weak
and short in duration, and it seemed difficult to explain clinical
findings on the basis of these experimental results.
on the other hand, clt could significantly reduce the catalepsy induced by haloperidol (hpd) in rats for several hours. the
relatively long-lasting influence exerted by clt on the extrapyramidal system in rats may be related to some clinical effects of
clt. in the present study, the effect of clt was investigated
behaviorally and neurochemically on hpd catalepsy in rats.
method
male slc-wistar rats (10 to 12 weeks old), purchased from the
shizuoka animal farm, shizuoka, were used throughout this
study. these animals were housed in groups of 5 in a temperature
(24 +- i°c) - and humidity (55 ± 5%)-controlled room under a i 2 hr
light/dark cycle (light on from 800 to 2000). they had free access
to food and water.
bilateral subdiaphragmatic vagotomies were surgically performed under pentobarbital anesthesia (14). hypophysectomy was
done under methylbexabital anesthesia through the external auditory canal (25). these lesioned rats were used for behavioral
experiments 9 to 10 days after the surgery.

clt dose-dependently reduced the catalepsy induced by 2
mg/kg, po, of hpd in rats (fig. 1). the anticataleptic effects of
clt at doses ranging from 10 to 80 i~g/kg, sc, were weak and
short in duration: significant inhibition of hpd catalepsy was seen
only at 2 hr posttreatment with clt. however, 160 v.g/kg, sc, of
clt markedly inhibited hpd catalepsy for 6 to 7 hr. clt (160

0.3 mg/k8, sc, hpd (not shown).
clt (160 ~g/kg, sc) produced sit,nificant protection against

fig. 4. influence of bilateral subdiaphragmatic vagotomies on the anticataleptic effect of clt in rats. vagotomies were surgically performed.
after 9-10 days of recovery, animals were given 2 mg/kg, po, of hpd
alone (o, n= 16) or concurrently with 160 ~g/kg, sc, of clt (0,
n= 15). each point represents the means---sem. **p<0.01, ***p<0.001

cantly inhibited hpd (2 mg/kg, po) catalepsy for the first 3 hr, but
not thereafter (fig. 4). however, hpd 0.75 mg/kg, po, although
inactive in normal rats, produced very strong catalepsy in rats with
bilateral subdiaphragmatic vagotomies. on the other hand, ( - ) l-364,718, even at a dose of 4 mg/kg, po, exerted no influence
on the effect of 0.75 mg/kg, po, hpd in normal animals. the
catalepsy nonspecifically caused by 0.75 mg/kg, po, hpd in
vagotomized rats was also significantly attenuated by 160 lxg/kg,
sc, of clt only for 2 hr (not shown).
hypophysectomy changed neither the cataleptogenic activity of
2 mg/kg, po, hpd nor the anticataleptic potency of clt (fig. 5).

neurochemical study
hpd at 2 mg/kg, po, which was used to reliably induce the
catalepsy, increased the extracellular level of striatal da by about
50% over the predrug level (fig. 6). the striatal output of dopac
and hva was also stimulated by some 120% above the basal
value. on the other hand, clt 160 ixg/kg, sc, which exhibited
relatively long-lasting inhibition of hpd catalepsy, failed to
significantly change the spontaneous release of da and its
metabolites from the rat striatum (not shown). clt also had little
influence on the hpd-induced increase in dopac and hva
output. however, clt caused significant inhibition of hpdinduced increase in da release from the striatum (fig. 6). this
effect of clt was observed when clt was administered concurrently with hpd, but not when given 1 hr after hpd. proglumide,
at 200 mg/kg, ip, completely antagonized the biochemical effect
of clt (fig. 6).
discussion

clt, at a high dose of 160 i~g/kg, sc, given concurrently with
2 mg/kg, po, hpd, produced relatively long-lasting inhibition of
hpd catalepsy in rats. clt (160 p.g/kg, sc) also markedly
reduced the catalepsy caused by 0.3 mg/kg, sc, hpd, suggesting
that the anticataleptic effect of clt was not due to its depressant
action on gastric emptying.

fig. 5. influence of hypophysectomy on the anticataleptic effect of clt
in rats. hypophysectomywas done through the external auditory canal. at
9-10 days after the lesion, rats were given 2 mg/kg, po, of hpd alone (©,
n= 13) or with 160 ttg/kg, sc, of clt ¢o, n = 20). each point represents
the means +_sem. **p<0.01, ***p<0.001 vs. hpd control (mannwhitney u-test).

some effects of cck and related peptides have been reported
to be mediated by the vagal afferents (5, 6, 13, 23). in the present
study, bilateral subdiaphragmatic vagotomies resulted in the nonspecific potentiation of hpd catalepsy, but nevertheless did not
abolish the anticataleptic action of clt. furthermore, clt at
doses less than 80 l~g/kg, sc, did not cause such long-term
inhibition of hpd catalepsy. these results indicate that vagal
afferent fibers do not play an important role in the long-lasting
anticataleptic effect of clt. it is also clear that the hypothalamushypophysis axis is not involved in the inhibition by clt of hpd
catalepsy, because hypophysectomy exerted no influence on the
behavioral effect of clt.
on the other hand, the anticataleptic effect of clt was blocked
by ( - )-l-364,718 and proglumide. ( - )-l-364,718, an extremely
potent and selective peripheral cck receptor antagonist (4), can
easily enter the brain from blood (22). proglumide, another
frequently used cck antagonist, is also reported to have the
ability to cross the blood-brain barrier (12). in addition, cck
receptor binding studies using autoradiographical techniques demonstrate that peripheral-type cck receptors ( xxxg352xxx ) occur not
only in the peripheral tissue (e.g., the pancreas) but also in discrete
brain regions including the posterior hypothalarnic nuclei, interpeduncular nuclei, area postrema and nucleus tractus solitarius (9,
10, 17).
from these findings, we hypothesize that clt, at a high dose
of 160 t~g/kg, sc, primarily acts on  xxxg352xxx  (the pancreas-type)
receptors in the brain, exerts some influence on the basal ganglia
and/or related structures via the unknown neural pathways and,
consequently, inhibits hpd catalepsy. of course, the possibility
that clt directly acts on the central-type cck receptors ( xxxg353xxx )
in the swiatum or substantia nigra cannot be excluded at present,
but the possibility of this is thought to be small.
hpd catalepsy is based on its da receptor blocking action in
the striatum, and da and cck functionally interact in a complex
manner. therefore, to obtain clues to the neurochemical mechanism of the anticataleptic action of clt, the striatal da metabolism was investigated using the in vivo microdialysis technique.

hpd (hr)

fig. 6. effects of combined drugs on striatal da metabolism in rats. the
extracellular levels of da, dopac and hva were examined using the
brain microdialysis technique. after stabilized spontaneous output of da
and its metabolites was obtained, the animals were given hpd alone (©,
n=5), clt + hpd (o, n = 5 ) or proglumide + clt + hpd (lit n=5).
proglumide (200 mg/kg, ip) was administered 15 min before concurrent
treatment with clt (160 p,g/kg, sc) and hpd (2 mg/kg, po). data were
expressed as a percent of the mean of the last three measurements taken
before drug application. each point represents the means - sem. *p<0.05,
**p<0.01 vs. hpd control (tukey's test).
clt was found to significantly inhibit the hpd-induced increase
in the striatal da release. this biochemical effect was also

completely antagonized by proglumide. moreover, in this case,
significantly higher levels of da and its metabolites were observed as compared with the case of administration of hpd alone.
at present, we cannot adequately explain this finding, because
3rs-n-(2,3-dihydro- l-methyl- 2-oxo-5-phenyl- i h- 1,4-benzodiazepine3-yl)- 1h-indole-3-carboxamide, synthesized in this laboratory and
a much more selective and potent  xxxg352xxx  antagonist than proglumide, also completely blocked anti-hpd action of clt but caused
no further potentiation of the hpd effect (since this cck
antagonist is not employed popularly, the data is not shown). at
any rate, these biochemical results correspond well to those
obtained in the behavioral study. as the da receptor blockade
underlies both the catalepsy and the increase in striatal da output
induced by hpd. clt given peripherally seems to indirectly exert
some modulatory influence on the way in which da receptors bind
hpd. in this respect, the electrophysiological findings that cck
markedly potentiates the response of midbrain da cells to da
agonists are very interesting (3, 7, 8). in vitro and ex vivo studies
are now undertaken to investigate the effect of clt on [3hispiroperidol or [~h]-n-propylnorapomorphine binding to striatal
da receptors.
at this time, we have no data to explain how clt modulates
hpd binding to da receptors. however, the effect must be mild
in nature, because clt did not completely block hpd catalepsy
and had little influence on the hpd-induced increase in dopac
and hva output. why only hpd-induced increase in da output
was significantly attenuated by clt may be explained as follows:
since the absolute concentration of extracellular da in the striatum
is much lower than those of dopac and hva and, moreover, da
would disappear far more rapidly from the extracellular space than
its metabolites, even a subtle change in hpd binding to da
receptors should exert a great influence on the extracellular level
of da.
