abstract
this paper focuses on the question whether different estrogens (e) have different qualitative pharmacodynamic effects when
used by women for contraception, hormone replacement therapy (hrt) or prevention of osteoporosis. in this context estrogens
have been defined as the estrogen agonists estradiol (e2), estrone (e1), estriol (e3),  xxxd2044xxx  (cee), diethylstilbestrol (des) and  xxxd2054xxx  (ee). selective  xxxg730xxx  modulator’s (serm’s) have been excluded from this
analysis primarily because of lack of comparative (clinical) data with estrogen agonists. a major problem when addressing the
issue of comparability of estrogen agonists is the lack of data from head-to-head estrogen-only comparative studies. comparative
studies have been performed almost exclusively with estrogen agonists combined with a series of different progestogens (p),
that have been added to protect the uterus from endometrial hyperplasia. since progestogens are known to exhibit different
intrinsic pharmacodynamic properties and interactions with estrogens, it is impossible to judge which role the estrogen plays
when qualitative differences between different combined e/p preparations are observed. in summary, no convincing evidence has
been found that the estrogens mentioned differ qualitatively. obviously quantitative differences are present due to differences in
e.g. receptor affinity, metabolism (half life) and route of administration (transdermal/vaginal). since des has been discarded for
human use due to teratogenicity, ee used in all combined e/p oral contraceptives is the most potent estrogen agonist available
at present. in hrt, e2 and cee are equally effective for the treatment of hot flushes and urogenital atrophy and superior to
any other treatment option. for long term treatment to prevent osteoporosis and even for short term hrt, estrogen agonists are
heavily debated recently because of a small increased risk of breast cancer, that has been known for a long time already. well
informed and individualised choice of treatment seems the appropriate solution.

1. introduction
estrogens are endogenous hormones with numerous physiological action. the most potent naturally
occurring estrogen in humans is 17␤-estradiol (e2 ),
followed by estrone (e1 ) and estriol (e3 ). estradiol,

(h.j.t. coelingh bennink).

estrone and estriol are derived from androgenic precursors (androstenedione or testosterone) through aromatization of the a-ring. estradiol is oxidized reversibly
to estrone, and both estradiol and estrone can be converted to estriol [1].
estradiol is the predominant estrogen during the
premenopausal period, and is mainly secreted by the
ovaries. after menopause, the main estrogen is estrone. estrone is synthesized in adipose tissue from

adrenal dehydroepiandrosterone. during pregnancy,
estriol is produced in large quantities by the placenta.
estradiol occurs in all mammals, regardless of sex
or age; its function, however, is related to the control of
female reproduction through cyclic release of anterior
pituitary hormones and to cyclic changes of the female
reproductive tract. during pregnancy, estradiol contributes to uterine growth, placental development, parturition, and the development of the mammary gland.
estrogenic activity is shared by many steroidal and
nonsteroidal compounds, both naturally occurring and
synthetic.  xxxd2044xxx  (cee) are a
mixture of naturally occurring estrogens and contain
 xxxd2046xxx  and  xxxd2018xxx  sulfate as the main constituents. synthetic derivatives from natural human estrogens have been developed, e.g.  xxxd2054xxx  (the
most common estrogen used in contraception) to increase potency after oral administration.
nonsteroidal compounds with (anti)estrogenic activity occur naturally in a variety of plants and fungi.
these so-called phytoestrogens have only weak activity, and their therapeutic effects remain as of yet unproven.
diethylstilbestrol (des) was one of the first nonsteroidal estrogens to be synthesized. it is structurally
related to estradiol. des is as potent as estradiol in
most assays, but has a longer half-life. nowadays, des
has no longer widespread use because of its potential
to induce congenital anomalies. a number of other
synthetic agents, including pesticides and plasticizers,
also have hormonal or antihormonal activity. the affinity of these ‘environmental’ estrogens for the estrogen
receptor is relatively weak, but their widespread presence and their potency for bioaccumulation in adipose
tissue have raised concern about their potential toxicity for mankind and wildlife [2].

2. human pharmacokinetics of oral estrogens
estradiol when given orally in its native crystalline
state is poorly absorbed via the gastro-intestinal tract
because of its extensive first pass hepatic effect, but
in micronized form it is well absorbed [3–7]. the
steady state pharmacokinetics of unconjugated estrogens is complicated by, among others, induction of
 xxxg2066xxx  (shbg) upon multiple
dosing, but once steady state is reached, plasma lev-

els remain stable. mean steady state levels of estradiol
around 30 pg/ml have been reported with once daily
dosing at a dose level of 1 mg, and between 55 and
80 pg/ml at a dose level of 2 mg per day. estradiol is
extensively metabolized by the liver. the major unconjugated and conjugated metabolites are estrone and
 xxxd2046xxx ; these metabolites can contribute to the
estrogenic activity, either directly or after reconversion to estradiol. the estrone-estradiol ratio after oral
dosing is about 5–7, and is irrespective of the estradiol dose [8–10]. estradiol is mainly excreted into the
urine as glucuronides and sulfate conjugates of estradiol and estrone [1]. the plasma half-life of estradiol
is very short, i.e. within minutes. due to entero-hepatic
recirculation, complete elimination of estradiol and
its metabolites after a single oral dose may take several days (i.e. up to 72 h following a single oral 2 mg
dose) [11–13]. there is no evidence of accumulation
of estradiol following long-term treatment.
 xxxd2054xxx  can also be used orally and is
more potent than estradiol, because the ethinyl substitution in the c17 position inhibits the first pass hepatic
metabolism. it is rapidly and almost completely absorbed from the gastro-intestinal tract.  xxxd2581xxx , like
some other (semi)synthetic estrogens, is rapidly converted in the liver to  xxxd2054xxx .  xxxd2054xxx  has a long half-life, with reported values of up to
13–27 h.  xxxd2054xxx  increases shbg. however,
it does not bind to shbg but rather to  xxxg124xxx .  xxxd2040xxx  has a much shorter half-life of
1.5 h, and is extensively bound to shbg.
other oral preparations contain  xxxd2044xxx , mainly the  xxxd3258xxx  of naturally occurring
estrogens. these are absorbed across the intestinal epithelium after hydrolization in the lower gut. serum
levels of estradiol and estrone that are achieved with
 xxxd2044xxx  are similar to those achieved
with oral administration of other naturally occurring
estrogens.
relative potency of different estrogen preparations
was investigated by von schoultz, [14] who reported
on the effects of estriol,  xxxd2046xxx , 17␤-estradiol,
and  xxxd2054xxx  in postmenopausal women on
among others the karypyknotic index of the vaginal epithelium, and on changes in fsh and shbg
concentrations. whereas the directions of the induced changes were similar with all studied estrogens,  xxxd2054xxx  invariably induced the largest

h.j.t. coelingh bennink / maturitas 61 (1–2) (2008) 195–201

response, consistent with its receptor affinity and nuclear retention time profile.  xxxd2054xxx  is also
more potent than  xxxd2044xxx , micronized
estradiol, and piperazine estrogen sulfate ( xxxd2046xxx )
with respect to fsh levels and liver proteins, and also
more potent than  xxxd2044xxx , micronized
estradiol,  xxxd2046xxx ,  xxxd2040xxx , or esterified
estrogens with respect to the effect on bone density
[15].

3. transdermal delivery of estrogens
estrogens are well absorbed through the skin,
and the use of transdermal estrogen preparations via
patches or gel formulations, is rapidly increasing.
transdermal delivery formulations provide slow, sustained release of estrogens, and more constant blood
levels than with oral administration. conversion of
estradiol to estrone is more slowly with parenteral
administration, and estradiol–estrone ratios of about
one are commonly reported with transdermal delivery, which is similar to the physiological ratio of the
premenopausal state.
different administration forms each may have their
own distinct pharmacokinetic profile. a direct comparison between estradiol from a gel, from a patch,
and  xxxd2040xxx  from an oral tablet at doses that
are normally used in clinical practice revealed quantitative but no qualitative differences in absorption and
bioavailability. the bioavailability of estradiol from
the gel relative to the oral tablet was 61%, and 109%
as compared with the patch. the gel was also not bioequivalent with the patch or the tablet [16].
there also seem to exist some quantitative differences between the oral and transdermal administration forms. estrogens in general have a presumed favorable action on the lipoprotein profile by increasing high-density lipoprotein (hdl) and decreasing
low-density lipoprotein (ldl) levels. this effect has
consistently been demonstrated in large randomized
controlled primary (pepi) [17] and secondary (hers)
[18] prevention studies. due to the presence of estrogen receptors in the liver, the beneficial effect of estrogens on the ldl levels is considered to result from
direct hepatic actions. with transdermal application
the impact on hepatic protein synthesis is reduced, as
it does not expose the liver to high concentrations of

197

estrogens via the portal circulation. this may explain
why the transdermal route is associated with less favorable changes in lipid profile compared to oral administration forms [19–22].

4. hormone replacement therapy
the therapeutic use of estrogens is widespread.
both naturally occurring and synthetic compounds are
available for oral and parenteral use. the most common use of estrogens is in contraception and as hormone replacement therapy (hrt) in (post)menopausal
women.
due to a decline of ovarian function with follicular depletion, the plasma concentrations of estradiol
decrease from 40–400 pg/ml during the menstrual cycle to a level of 5–20 pg/ml at the time of menopause,
and peripheral conversion of adrenal androstenedione
to estrone becomes the principal source of estrogen.
in most women, this source does not provide enough
estrogen to prevent symptoms of estrogen deficiency.
the pharmacological principle behind hrt is to increase the circulating levels of estrogens, but additional treatment with progestogens is mandatory in
women with an intact uterus to limit the effects of
estrogen-induced hyperplasia [23–29].
4.1. climacteric complaints
climacteric complaints (mainly vasomotor changes
such as hot flushes and night sweats) are one of the
earliest symptoms of estrogen deficiency, and are the
most likely reason for starting hrt. different available estrogen preparations and administration forms
all seem to provide dose-dependent, adequate symptom relief [16,20,30]. other symptoms that may occur after a longer period of estrogen deficiency include tissue changes in the genital tract and bladder,
with resulting changes in sexual function and urinary
symptoms. urogential atrophy favorably responds to
estrogen replacement therapy with similar effects of
different estrogens [31].
4.2. osteoporosis
hrt has been proven effective for the long-term
consequences of estrogen depletion, i.e. prevention of

198

h.j.t. coelingh bennink / maturitas 61 (1–2) (2008) 195–201

postmenopausal osteoporosis. the annual rate of bone
loss in the first 5 years after menopause is estimated
at 3–5% [32,33]. estrogens prevent bone loss through
inhibition of bone resorption, and are associated with
an increase in bone mineral density. the effect of estrogen on the bone is dose-dependent, with no gross
differences between currently available formulations
or administration forms [34–40]. estrogen use is also
associated with a decrease in the incidence of osteoporotic fractures (e.g. fractures of the hip and vertebrae). epidemiological surveys have shown that the
incidence of fractures is reduced by 20–45% in hrt
users compared to non-users [41–44]. this was recently confirmed in a randomized placebo controlled
trial [45].
4.3. cardiovascular effects
estrogen has been considered to be a protective factor against cardiovascular disease, although the underlying mechanisms were incompletely understood.
before midlife, death due to cardiovascular disease is
infrequent in women, but not in men. from the age
of 55 onwards, numbers are increasing much more
rapidly in women than in males, and beyond the age
of 85 years, the gender ratio is inverted [46]. whether
estrogen supplementation reduces the risk of cardiovascular disease and related death in postmenopausal
women is currently under debate. a meta-analysis of
large observational studies has indicated that current
use of hrt is associated with a statistically significant reduction in coronary heart disease (chd) (rr,
0.80; 95% ci, 0.68–0.95) and also in mortality from
heart disease (rr, 0.62; 95% ci, 0.40–0.90) [47].
however, the results from prospectively randomized
placebo-controlled trials seem to point in another direction. the results from hers showed no reduction
in the overall rate of chd events in women with preexisting cardiovascular disease (rr, 0.99; 95% ci,
0.81–1.22), although there was a statistically significant time trend, with more chd events in the hrt
group after 1 year of use, but fewer chd events after 2 years of use [18]. the results from the long-term
follow up were comparable, i.e. a relative risk of 1.00
(95% ci: 0.77–1.29) [48]. the findings from the whi
study are also suggestive of a negative effect (rr,
1.29; 95% ci, 1.02–1.63), and the estrogen plus progestin arm of the study was prematurely stopped after

a mean number of 5.2 years of follow-up, although
the fact that the estrogen-only arm is being continued
indicates that the increased risk is possibly not considered estrogen-related [45]. also, the mean age of
the women in the whi study was rather high (63.2
years in the active treatment group, and 63.3 years in
the placebo arm), which is well above the age that
hrt should be started for prevention. it can further
be assumed that the frequency of baseline climacteric
complaints, in particular hot flushes, would have been
rather low in this study population, as it would have
been unethical to treat such women with placebo for a
prolonged time. this would put the whi study population distinct from the populations commonly described
in case control cohort studies, which are mostly selected for presence of (severe) climacteric complaints.
it could very well be that women who present with
hot flushes are more susceptible to beneficial arterial
cardiovascular effects of hrt than women with no
vasomotor complaints.
4.4. colon cancer
current or recent hrt use is clearly associated
with a reduced risk of colon cancer, and this effect is
consistently found both in retrospective cohort studies [49–51] as well as in prospectively randomized
controlled trials [45,52]. the duration of use does
not seem to play a significant role, however past
use did not provide protection. different treatment
regimens—either estrogen alone, or combination
treatment—appear to have similar effects.
5. risks associated with hrt
the most common side effects with estrogen use
include nausea, breast tension/pain, vaginal bleeding, headache and weight gain, but these side effects
are usually mild and transient. hair loss seems to
be specifically associated with premarin (prempro,
premphase) use [53]. other, less common, serious adverse effects include breast cancer, thromboembolic
disease, and gallbladder disease.
5.1. breast cancer
the risk of breast cancer seems definitely to be increased among hrt users. a reanalysis of data from

h.j.t. coelingh bennink / maturitas 61 (1–2) (2008) 195–201

51 studies [54] showed a slight increase in the relative
risk of having breast cancer diagnosed in current users
of hrt, and in those who ceased use 1–4 years previously. the increase was 1.023 (95% ci, 1.011–1.036)
with each year of use. mortality from breast cancer,
however, seems to be reduced [55]. the risk of breast
cancer is related to hrt treatment duration and returns to that of never-users within 5 years after stopping hrt. again, there seems to be no gross differences with different treatment regimens.

5.2. thromboembolic disease
it is now generally recognized that there is a twoto three-fold increase in the incidence of deep venous
thrombosis and pulmonary embolism with estrogen
replacement therapy [45,52,56–58]. the risk seems to
increase with higher doses of estrogen, and is highest within the first year of use (rr, 3.49; 95% ci,
2.33–5.59) [47]. again, there seem to be no differences between different estrogen preparations or administration forms.
5.3. gallbladder disease
many but not all studies have indicated an increase
in the incidence of gallbladder disease in current and
long-term users of hrt. the risk remains elevated
in those who stop treatment [47,59]. this finding is
consistent with the increase in biliary tract surgery
reported in hers (rr, 1.48; 95% ci, 1.12–1.95) [52].

parisons between different hrt regimens, and also
the addition of progestogens for uterine protection
makes it difficult to assess the role of different estrogen preparations in hrt. nevertheless, all currently
available estrogen preparations seem to have a comparable benefit–risk profile (see table 1).
transdermal estrogens appear to have a smaller beneficial effect on the lipid profile than oral estrogens,
presumably because the liver is not exposed to high
estrogen levels. whether this has an effect on cardiovascular disease risk is as of yet unclear.
currently available estrogens have both benefits
and harms. improvement should focus on known
safety issues, i.e. reduction of breast cancer incidence,
thromboembolic disease, and gallbladder disease.
tolerability—or more specifically, a more favorable
side effect profile—would be important for patient
compliance, especially with long-term treatment. as
estrogens have a direct hepatic action, drug–drug
interactions remain a source of potential concern.

6. concluding remarks
different estrogen formulations are currently available for oral and parenteral, especially transdermal
use. the relative potencies of the various oral preparations differ widely, mainly due to differences in pharmacokinetic behavior. the pharmacokinetic profile of
transdermal application forms is distinct from that of
oral preparations. the differences seem to be quantitative rather than qualitative.
a treatment regimen containing cee with  xxxd2554xxx  (mpa) was used in all larger
randomized placebo-controlled hrt trials, because it
constitutes the predominant regimen in the us, where
the trials were set up. there are no head-to-head com-
