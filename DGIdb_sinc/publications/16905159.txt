abstract
patterns of protein expression can be used to identify biomarkers of disease, prognosis or treatment response. peripheral 5-ht2a and d3
receptors have been proposed as protein markers in schizophrenia. we investigated the possible parallel regulation of these candidate biomarkers
in central nervous system (cns) and peripheral blood cells by a comparative study of the effects of antipsychotic treatment on the expression of
the receptors in both systems in rats. acute (24 and 48 h) and subchronic (16 days) treatment of rats with olanzapine induced a significant
decrease in  xxxg1113xxx  density both in frontal cortex (bmax ¼ 76.2%, 83.0% and 46.0% of control after 24 h, 48 h and 16 days of treatment,
respectively; p < 0.01) and blood platelets (bmax z 55% of control at all times measured; p < 0.01), without any changes in receptor affinity.
furthermore, olanzapine induced redistribution in 5-ht2a-like immunoreactivity and time-dependent remodelling of synaptic circuits involved
in the activity of pyramidal and gabaergic neurons in frontoparietal motor cortex of treated rats, as assessed by immunohistochemical studies.
 xxxg657xxx  mrna levels increased significantly by 52.5% (p < 0.01) and 21.1% (p < 0.05) in nucleus accumbens, and by 53.4% (p < 0.05)
and 91.7% (p < 0.01) in lymphocytes, after acute (24 h and 48 h) treatment with olanzapine, returning to levels similar to control after subchronic treatment (16 days). in conclusion, we observed in rats after olanzapine treatment: (1) parallelism in the regulation of 5-ht2a receptors
in frontal cortex and in blood platelets; (2) parallelism in the regulation of d3 mrna levels in nucleus accumbens and lymphocytes. these
results endorse the interest in future studies aimed at validating these receptors as candidate biomarkers in schizophrenia.

1. introduction
the most immediately promising outcome from the pharmacogenomics era has been the application of biomarkers in
clinical diagnosis and therapeutics (lewin and weiner,
2004). the identification of biomarkers for the response to
drug treatments in some situations may also offer

opportunities for the development of tests that provide early
prediction of the response of individual patients to therapy
(rolan et al., 2003).
the present study focused on two pharmacological targets
for antipsychotic drugs, which have previously been proposed
as candidate markers in schizophrenia. serotonin  xxxg1113xxx  has been proposed as a candidate marker both in
schizophrenia (pandey et al., 1993; govitrapong et al., 2000;
arranz et al., 2003) and in the drug response to the disease
(meltzer et al., 2003; meltzer, 2004). current hypotheses
suggest that the cognition-enhancing actions of atypical

924

j.f. padı́n et al. / neuropharmacology 51 (2006) 923e932

antipsychotics may occur due to enhanced prefrontal cortical
dopamine release brought about by interaction with these
receptors (williams et al., 2002; meltzer et al., 2003); the
so-called 5-ht2a/d2 model (meltzer et al., 2003; meltzer,
2004) is associated with the serotoninedopamine hypothesis,
which suggests that blockade of presynaptic 5-ht2a receptors
by atypical antipsychotics is predominant in the nigrostriatal,
mesocortical and tuberoinfundibular dopaminergic pathways
in which they increase dopamine release. this effect will
counteract the action of the drugs at d2 receptors, decreasing
the incidence of adverse extrapyramidal reactions, cognitive
deficits, hyperprolactinaemia and/or negative symptoms. in
contrast, d2 blockade would prevail in the dopaminergic
mesolimbic pathways, resulting in mitigation of the positive
symptoms of psychosis.
dopamine d3 receptors have been proposed as potential
peripheral markers for schizophrenia: higher levels of  xxxg657xxx  mrna have been found in schizophrenic patients
than in control subjects showing no psychiatric pathology
(ilani et al., 2001; kwak et al., 2001). in addition, these receptors are targets for antipsychotic drugs (for review see leriche
et al., 2004).
the definition of biomarkers provided by the food and
drug administration (fda) states that a ‘‘valid biomarker’’
is a ‘‘biomarker that is measured in an analytical test system
with well-established performance characteristics and for
which there is an established scientific framework or body
of evidence that elucidates the physiological, toxicological,
pharmacological, or clinical significance of the results’’
(biomarkers definitions working group, 2001; lewin and
weiner, 2004). an analytical test involving peripheral blood
would therefore be considered ideal. both 5-ht2a and d3
receptors are expressed in peripheral blood cells. for this reason, we are interested in assessing whether expression of these
receptors in the central nervous system (cns) and peripheral
blood in response to drug treatment varies in parallel.
in the present study, we hypothesize that olanzapine, which
shows high affinity for 5-ht2a and d3 receptors (pki ¼ 8.4
and 7.3, respectively; schmidt et al., 2001), would induce similar changes in the level of the expression of these receptors in
the cns and in peripheral blood cells. the experiments were
carried out with spragueedawley rats, and a protocol was
used in which the olanzapine dosage was equivalent to the
therapeutic dosage applied in clinical practice. frontal cortex
5-ht2a receptors and d3 mrna expressed in different dopaminergic areas were proposed for study because they appear to
play a key role in the effects of olanzapine in humans (for review see meltzer et al., 2003; leriche et al., 2004). levels of
expression of blood platelet 5-ht2a receptors and of d3
mrna in lymphocytes were used to compare olanzapinemediated peripheral regulation, because both receptors have
been proposed as peripheral biomarkers in schizophrenia
(see above).
methods that have already been widely applied and described
were used for studying these receptors ([3h] xxxd2419xxx  for
binding 5-ht2a receptors and rtepcr for d3 receptors) (see
gray and roth, 2001 for description of methods for 5-ht2a

receptors and ilani et al., 2001; kwak et al., 2001; vogel et al.,
2004 for d3 mrna expression). haloperidol competition binding studies were used to validate washout periods for binding
throughout the study.
the aim of the present study was therefore to investigate
in parallel regulatory effects induced by olanzapine on the
expression of 5-ht2a and d3 receptors in the cns and peripheral blood cells.
2. material and methods
2.1. animals
all experiments were carried out in duplicate, and a total of 96 male
spragueedawley rats were used. the animals were randomly distributed in
groups of 3e5 per cage, maintained in a room at constant temperature
(22  1  c) with 12 h of light (08:00e20:00 h) and provided food and water
ad libitum throughout the study. the rats used for acute treatments (24 and
48 h) weighed 260  20 g at the beginning of the experiment; those used
for chronic treatment (16 days) weighed 220  20 g. all procedures were conducted in accordance with the european communities council directive of 24
november 1986 (86/609/eec), royal decree of 14 march 1988 (223/1988/
boe). the animals were purchased from the central animal facility of the
university of santiago de compostela, registered and approved according to
the order of 13 october 1989 (250/1989/boe).

2.2. olanzapine administration
treated animals were administered olanzapine (i.p. 0.8 mg/kg/day), with
0.9% nacl and lactic acid (ph 6) as the vehicle. control animals were administered vehicle alone. all injections were carried out daily between 08:30 and
09:30 h. there was an interval of 24 h between the final administration of drug
or vehicle and killing the animals.

2.3. drugs
[3h] xxxd2419xxx  (specific activity, 88 ci/mmol) was obtained from perkine
elmer life sciences inc. (barcelona, spain). haloperidol,  xxxd2637xxx  and
sodium pentobarbital were purchased from sigma/rbi (madrid, spain). the
olanzapine used in the study was obtained by extraction from zyprexaò tablets
as follows. thirty zyprexaò tablets (10 mg) were suspended in 200 ml of
a mixture of dichloromethane/methanol (9:1) and stirred at room temperature
for 3 h. the solution turned yellow and was then filtered through a celite pad.
the filtrate was concentrated in vacuo to obtain a yellow residue. purification
by column chromatography on silica gel with dichloromethane/methanol (7:3)
as eluent afforded a yellow solid; further purification was performed by recrystallization from methanol to obtain 250 mg of a compound that has been
identified as the 2-methyl-4-(4-methyl-1-piperazinyl)-10h-thieno[2,3-b][1,5]
benzodiazepine. melting point 193e195  c (isopropanol). 1h-nmr (dmsod6 300 mhz), d (ppm): 7.60 (m, 1h, aromatic), 6.86e6.77 (m, 2h,
aromatics), 6.68 (m, 1h, aromatic), 6.32 (s, 1h, ch), 4.55 (bs, 1h, nh),
2.50 (m, 4h, 2 ch2), 2.45 (m, 4h, 2 ch2), 2.25 (s, 3h, ch3), 2.23 (s,
3h, ch3). ms (70 ev); m/z (%): 312 (mþ, 35), 254 (12), 242 (100), 210 (40).

2.4. isolation of rat platelets and membrane preparation
the rats were anaesthetized with sodium pentobarbital (i.p. 60 mg/kg)
before blood was extracted from them by cardiac puncture, with acd as anticoagulant (85 mm trisodium citrate, 65 mm  xxxd1710xxx , 111 mm anhydrous
glucose) at a ratio of 1:6 (v/v). the blood was centrifuged at 387  g for
8 min at 25  c to obtain platelet rich plasma (prp). the prp was then centrifuged at 1,076  g for 20 min at 25  c to obtain a pellet, which was washed
twice under the same conditions as before. the platelets were lysed with a
solution of 5 mm tris, 0.1% edta at ph 7.4 and then homogenized in
a polytronò for 15 s (setting 6, 3 times), on ice. the resulting cellular

j.f. padı́n et al. / neuropharmacology 51 (2006) 923e932
homogenate was centrifuged twice at 32,900  g for 20 min at 4  c. the
membranes obtained were finally resuspended in buffer containing 50 mm
tris, 120 mm nacl, 5 mm kcl, 1 mm mgcl2 and 0.05%  xxxd228xxx , ph
7.4. the membrane samples were stored at 80  c and defrosted immediately
before the experiments by homogenizing them manually for 5 min at 4  c.

2.5. isolation of rat lymphocytes
the platelets were removed from the blood, which was then reconstituted
with platelet free plasma and then diluted 1:1 with 0.9% nacl. the lymphocytes were isolated from 4 ml of diluted blood (1:1), on a discontinuous
percoll gradient (3 ml, density 1.078 g/ml, on 3 ml, density 1.086 g/ml). the
cells were centrifuged at 800  g for 20 min at 25  c, and the lymphocytes
obtained were then resuspended in 8 ml of 0.9% nacl and washed twice at
100  g for 10 min at 25  c. the pellet obtained was resuspended in 1 ml
of 0.9% nacl and centrifuged in an eppendorf tube at 3500  g for 10 min,
after an aliquot was reserved for counting number of cells in a cell-dyn
4000ò (abbott diagnostics). the final pellet of lymphocytes was dried and
stored at 80  c until use for total rna extraction.

2.6. isolation of rat frontal cortex and membrane preparation
immediately the blood cells were extracted, animals were divided into two
groups; one group was perfused for immunohistochemical studies and the
other was used for isolation of the rat frontal cortex for membrane preparation.
striatum and nucleus accumbens of the same animals were also removed and
immediately frozen at 80  c for further total rna isolation. the samples of
cerebral cortex were added to a 0.32 m solution of sucrose at a ratio of 1:10
(w/v), homogenized in a polytron and centrifuged at 1000  g for 10 min at
4  c. the supernatant was centrifuged at 24,000  g for 30 min at 4  c to
obtain a pellet of membranes. the pellet was resuspended in buffer containing
50 mm tris, 0.1% edta, ph 8.07 at a ratio of 1:10 (w/v) (calculated using the
initial weight of the sample), and was homogenized manually. the homogenate was incubated at 37  c for 15 min to eliminate endogenous 5-ht, and
was finally centrifuged at 24,000  g for 30 min at 4  c. the resulting pellet
was resuspended in buffer containing 50 mm tris, 0.1% edta, ph 6.6 at a
ratio of 2:1 (w/v) on the basis of the initial weight of the cerebral cortex. the
membrane samples were stored at 80  c and defrosted immediately before
the experiments by homogenizing them manually for 5 min at 4  c.

2.7. protein determination of membrane samples
the concentration of total protein in the membrane samples was determined by the method of bradford (1976).

2.8. radioligand binding assay for 5-ht2a receptors
2.8.1. [3h] xxxd2419xxx  saturation studies on rat frontal cerebral cortex
eight concentrations of [3h] xxxd2419xxx  (0.5e32 nm) were used. nonspecific binding was determined with  xxxd2637xxx  (60 mm). protein was added
at a rate of 30 mg/tube. the solutions were made up to a final volume of
200 ml with test buffer containing 50 mm tris, 4 mm cacl2 and 0.1% ascorbic
acid, ph 6.6. the samples were incubated for 30 min at 37  c.
2.8.2. [3h] xxxd2419xxx  saturation studies in rat blood platelets
the blood platelet membranes were incubated with 11 different concentrations of [3h] xxxd2419xxx  (0.5e32 nm). non-specific binding was measured with
 xxxd2637xxx  (60 mm). the amount of protein used was 140 mg/tube. a final
volume of 200 ml was achieved by adding test buffer containing 50 mm
tris, 120 mm nacl, 5 mm kcl, 1 mm mgcl2 and 0.05%  xxxd228xxx , ph
7.4. the samples were incubated for 1 h at 25  c.
2.8.3. [3h] xxxd2419xxx  competition studies on blood platelet and cerebral
cortex membranes
[3h] xxxd2419xxx  (3 nm for platelets and 1 nm for cortex) was added to all
tubes. competition experiments were carried out with 8 concentrations of
haloperidol (0.01 nm to 100 mm).

925

in all the binding studies the reaction was stopped by placing the tubes on ice.
vacuum filtering was carried out with a 30-channel brandel harvesterò, using
whatmanò gf/c filters of diameter 2.5 cm. the filters were dried and then
placed in vials with 4 ml of universolò scintillating fluid. the radioactivity
was measured by liquid scintillation in a beta counter (beckman ls-6000llò).

2.9. immunohistochemical studies of frontoparietal
motor cortex
rats were deeply anaesthetized with sodium pentobarbital then perfused
transcardially firstly with 0.1 m phosphate buffer (pb) (ph 7.4) and then
with 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 m pb. the rat brains were removed and
postfixed by immersion in the same fixative at 4  c for 6 h. after the brains
were cryoprotected, coronal blocks containing prefrontal cortex were cut on
a cryostat to provide sections of thickness 40 mm.
floating sections from the brain of each animal were incubated in a humid
chamber at room temperature with the following: (1) 10% h2o2 in 0.05 m
tris-buffered saline (tbs), ph 7.4, for 30 min to block the endogenous peroxidase activity; (2) three washes in 0.2% triton x-100 in tbs (tbs-t) each of
5 min (3  5 min); (3) incubation with a purified monoclonal mouse antiserotonin receptor 5-ht2a antibody (pharmingen) diluted 3 mg/ml in tbs-t
overnight at room temperature; (4) 3  5 min washes; (5) incubation with biotinylated goat anti mouse antiserum (dako) diluted 1:500 during 1 h; (6)
3  5 min washes; (7) incubation with strept abc complex (dako) for
30 min; (8) 3  5 min washes. peroxidase activity was visualized by incubation with 0.005% 3,3 0 -diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride (dab, sigma)
and 0.003% h2o2 in tbs. the sections were rinsed in tbs, dehydrated,
cleared in xylene and mounted with eukitt.
photomicrographs were obtained with an olympus dp-12 digital colour
camera on an olympus bx51 microscope (olympus optical, tokyo, japan).
pictures were adjusted using corel photopaint 12, and plate photomontage
and lettering were carried out with coreldraw 12 software (corel corp.,
ottawa, canada).

2.10. total rna isolation and reverse transcriptionepcr
analysis of  xxxg657xxx 
total rna was isolated from 1 million lymphocytes or from homogenates
of rat striatum or nucleus accumbens by the trizol method. the quantity and
quality of the rna was determined by absorption spectrophotometry (260e
280 nm). reverse transcription to cdna was carried out with 2 mg of total
rna, with random-primers (500 ng), dntps (1 mm), 40 iu of rnase inhibitor and 200 u of reverse transcriptase (moloney murine leukaemia virus) in
a final volume of 30 ml. the pcr amplification was carried out with 3 ml of
the obtained cdna, 1  pcr buffer (perkineelmer), dntps (100 nm), specific forward and reverse primers (100 nm) (invitrogen s.a., barcelona,
spain) and 1.25 u of taq dna polymerase (perkineelmer), in a final volume
of 50 ml. the pcr was carried out with a dna thermocycler (eppendorf personal mastercyclerò): 38 cycles were applied for the d3 product (217 bp) and
23 cycles for amplification of the constitutive  xxxg1075xxx  product (139 bp), at an
annealing temperature of 58  c. amplification was linear from 30e40 cycles
for d3 and between 19 and 25 cycles for  xxxg1075xxx . specific primers for d3 and
 xxxg1075xxx  pcr were designed to include at least one intron to avoid amplification
of genomic dna, and the sequences were as follows: d3 forward 5 0 tggtgtccttctacgttccc-3 0 (nucleotides 81e101), d3 reverse
5 0 -cccttattgaaaactgccga-3 0 (nucleotides 278e298),  xxxg1075xxx  forward
5 0 -cagccctgccgtcgtgatta-3 0 (nucleotides 97e117), and  xxxg1075xxx 
reverse 5 0 -agcaagacgttcagtcctgtc-3 0 (nucleotides 215e235).
the identity of the pcr products was confirmed by sequencing analysis
and southern blots. semi-quantification of the pcr products was carried out
by densitometry on 2% agarose gels stained with 0.5 mg/ml ethidium bromide
with the biorad gel doc 2000 and quantity one biorad software (bio-rad
laboratories, hercules, ca, usa). a semi-quantitative approach was used to
compare the optical density value of each d3 pcr product with that of  xxxg1075xxx 
pcr product from the same tissue sample.
the isolation method used yields a relatively low number of lymphocytes
(1 million/rat), and as no differences among rat groups were observed after

treatment with vehicle for 24 h, 48 h or 16 days (data not shown) in preliminary studies, a single control was used for each of the treatments to avoid
sacrificing a large amount of animals for each time-point tested.

2.11. expression of results and statistical analysis
saturation curves were analysed by non-linear regression (one-site binding
hyperbola). data were fitted to a rectangular hyperbola by the following
equation:
y ¼ bmax

x
½kd þ x

ð1þ

where x is the concentration of the radioligand and y represents the specific
binding. the maximum number of binding sites (bmax) and the dissociation
constant (kd) were determined from the non-linear regression curves as the
maximum plateau value and the ligand concentration required to reach halfmaximal binding sites occupied at equilibrium, respectively. the scatchard
plot (scatchard, 1949) is a straight line defined by the equation:
y¼

where y is the quotient of ligand bound/free and x is the bound ligand.
competition curves were analysed by non-linear regression. data were
fitted to a sigmoid curve defined by the equation:

where y is the specific binding, x is the log concentration (m ) and ic50 is the

saturation parameters (kd and bmax) in rat frontal
cerebral cortex
the characteristics of [3h] xxxd2419xxx  binding to 5-ht2a receptors were studied, by means of saturation experiments and
competition with haloperidol, in membranes from cerebral
frontal cortex and platelets of control rats and rats treated
with olanzapine at a dose of 0.8 mg/kg/day (i.p.) (equivalent
to the dose used in human therapy) for 24 h, 48 h and 16 days.
two-way anova revealed that olanzapine administration
caused a significant decrease in the density of 5-ht2a receptors in rat frontal cerebral cortex (bmax 76.2%, 83.0% and
46.0% of control in rats treated for 24 h, 48 h and 16 days,
respectively) [f(1,11) ¼ 33.91, p < 0.01] with no difference
among different times of treatment (fig. 1a, table 1).
the affinity constants (kd) for [3h] xxxd2419xxx  at 5-ht2a receptors in frontal cerebral cortex did not differ significantly

3.2. effect of olanzapine treatment on [3h] xxxd2419xxx 
saturation parameters (kd and bmax) in blood platelets
two-way anova revealed that administration of olanzapine caused a significant decrease in the density of [3h] xxxd2419xxx  binding sites in membranes from rat blood platelets at all

competition parameters in cerebral cortex and
blood platelet membranes
in the studies of competition for [3h] xxxd2419xxx  binding sites,
there was no significant difference in the affinity constant values
(pki) for haloperidol in either frontal cerebral cortex or blood
platelets among controls and treated groups (fig. 2, table 2).
3.4. changes in the neuronal distribution of 5-ht2a
receptor in the frontoparietal motor cortex after
olanzapine treatment
in the frontoparietal motor cortex of control rats, 5-ht2a
receptor immunolabelling was observed as two intensely

stained immunoreactive bands, located in layers ii and iii
and layer v (fig. 3a, b). in layer ii and iii numerous immunostained dendritic processes were observed, which were
aligned in parallel (fig. 3a). in layer v numerous pyramidal
neurons showed intense immunolabelling of the somata and
proximal part of the main apical dendrite (fig. 3b). some
immunoreactive neurons with non pyramidal morphology
were also found in layer i and layer vi, and most of these
cells exhibited immunoreactive dots in the periphery of the
somata (fig. 3c). scarce varicose 5-ht2a immunoreactive fibres were present in layers i and vi (fig. 3d). a schematic
representation of the pattern of expression of 5-ht2a receptors with respect to the pyramidal cell anatomy is shown in
fig. 3i.
although after 24 and 48 h of olanzapine treatment the pattern of 5-ht2a immunoreactivity was similar to that found in
control animals, treated animals displayed a lower level of 5ht2a immunoreactive pyramidal neurons in layer v (fig. 3f),
and a higher density of 5-ht2a immunoreactivity in dendrites
of layer ii and the upper part of layer iii (fig. 3e); in layers i
and vi the pattern of immunoreactivity and intensity of labelling were similar to those in untreated animals (data not
shown).
after 16 days of treatment, the  xxxg1113xxx  was almost
only restricted to the somata, and no immunolabelled dendrites
were distinguished. most of the positive cells showed pyramidal morphology and were located in layer v (fig. 3g). few
positive cells with a weak immunoreactivity were present in
layer i and vi (fig. 3h).

3.5. effect of olanzapine treatment on dopamine d3
receptor mrna levels in cns and in blood lymphocytes
comparison of two areas of the cns (striatum and nucleus
accumbens) with peripheral cells (blood lymphocytes) showed
that in the nucleus accumbens [f(3,8) ¼ 27.74, p < 0.01]
(fig. 4b, table 3) and blood lymphocytes [f(3,8) ¼ 29.95,
p < 0.01] (fig. 4c, table 3) there was a significant increase
in  xxxg657xxx  mrna levels after short-term olanzapine treatment (24 and 48 h) (p < 0.01 for 24 and p < 0.05 for
48 h in nucleus accumbens; p < 0.05 for 24 and p < 0.01 for
48 h in lymphocytes), whereas the levels of  xxxg657xxx 

mrna in the striatum remained unchanged after olanzapine
treatment for the same lengths of time. however, longer treatments (16 days) resulted in no significant changes in  xxxg657xxx  mrna levels in any of the tissue samples compared with
the levels in control rats (fig. 4a, table 3).
4. discussion
in the present study, olanzapine-mediated regulation of
serotonin 5-ht2a and dopamine d3 receptors were studied
in parallel in rat cns and blood cells, after acute (24 and
48 h) and subchronic (16 days) drug treatment.
5-ht2a and d3 receptors are targeted by olanzapine, a firstline atypical antipsychotic structurally related to clozapine and
widely used in clinical practice. the dosage of olanzapine
used in the present study (0.8 mg/kg/day) was chosen as
equivalent to the therapeutic dosage used in humans (0.1e
0.5 mg/kg/day). taking into account pharmacokinetic data
(aravagiri et al., 1999) and the fact that the rate of metabolism
in rats is 5 times faster than in humans, a dosage of olanzapine
in the range of 0.5e2.5 mg/kg/day was selected. further
requisites of the chosen dosage were the absence of adverse
affects in the animals equivalent to human extrapyramidal
side effects, lack of effects on the locomotor activity of the
animals or lack of induction of catalepsia, and the production
of anxiolytic activity without causing sedation (nowakowska

a dosage of olanzapine of less than 1 mg/kg/day (i.p.).
4.1. analysis of the expression of  xxxg1113xxx  in rat
cns and platelets
as previously mentioned, 5-ht2a receptors have been
proposed as candidate markers in schizophrenia and they constitute targets of antipsychotic medication. here a classical
methodology (i.e. [3h] xxxd2419xxx  binding) was used for the
determination of  xxxg1113xxx  density on antipsychotic
treatment both in rat cerebral cortex and blood platelets, which
allowed direct comparison of the results obtained in both systems as well as with those of previously reported studies (for
review see gray and roth, 2001).
in the present study, administration of olanzapine at a dosage of 0.8 mg/kg/day (i.p.) was shown to cause a decrease in
the density (bmax) of 5-ht2a receptors in frontal cerebral cortex of rats. the decrease in bmax values was significant

(p < 0.01) after 24 h (bmax ¼ 76.2% of control), 48 h
(bmax ¼ 83.0% of control), and 16 days of treatment
(bmax ¼ 46.0% of control). 5-ht2a bmax values for control
rats remained constant at all times of drug administration.
the present data are consistent with the results of previous
studies in which the density of 5-ht2a receptors in frontal cortex was reported to decrease significantly after 3 weeks of
chronic treatment of rats with olanzapine, at dosages of 1
and 2 mg/kg/day (i.p.) (kusumi et al., 2000), and the density
of receptors in the medial prefrontal cortex and in the dorsolateral frontal cortex decreased to 42% and 28% of control
values respectively, after 4 weeks at doses of 5 mg/kg administered by continuous perfusion (tarazi et al., 2002).
in blood platelets of olanzapine-treated animals, there was
a significant decrease in [3h] xxxd2419xxx  binding sites (bmax z
55% of control) for all lengths of treatment (p < 0.01). the results of a previous study showed that for the same length of
treatment, clozapine (10 mg/kg), ()1-(2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodophenyl)-2-aminopropane [()-doi] (2.5 mg/kg), and  xxxd1785xxx  (10 mg/kg) induced similar reductions in the
functional response of 5-ht2a receptors in rat aorta (enguix
et al., 2003). twist et al. (1990) carried out a study of
chronic treatment in rats in which regulation of 5-ht2a
receptors in the cns and blood platelets following treatment with ritanserin (i.p. 10 mg/kg/day) for 28 days, were
compared. ritanserin caused a decrease in the density of 5ht2a receptors labelled with [3h] xxxd2419xxx  in the cerebral
cortex although it caused an increase in the density of these
receptors in blood platelets, assessed by labelling of the receptors with [131i]lsd. one possible explanation for the differences between these results and those of the present study
may be the different radioligand employed in brain and
platelets (elliott and kent, 1989), which makes comparison
between both tissue systems more difficult.
under the experimental conditions used, the presence of
residual olanzapine in the tissues under study as a possible
cause of bias in the results was ruled out for three reasons:
(i) the time interval from the final administration of the drug
to killing the animals was 24 h, enough time to allow drug
clearance considering that the reported half life (t1/2) of olanzapine in rats after administration of an oral dose of 1 mg/kg is
5.1 h in the brain and 2.5 h in the plasma (aravagiri et al.,
1999); (ii) there were no significant differences in the affinity
(kd) for [3h] xxxd2419xxx  among control and treated animals in
either of the tissues studied; (iii) the same was observed for the
affinity (ki) of haloperidol among the different groups of
animals and different tissues studied. for these reasons, the
tissues were almost certainly free of olanzapine.
in summary, the present study of regulation of 5-ht2a
receptors demonstrated that in sprague dawley rats, a dosage
of 0.8 mg/kg/day of olanzapine produced a simultaneous decrease in the density of receptors in cerebral cortex and blood
platelets without affecting the affinity (kd) in either of the systems; this allowed consideration of the changes in the levels of
peripheral expression of these receptors as predictive of
changes in their expression in the cns. however, it should
be pointed out that the aim of the present study was only to

930

j.f. padı́n et al. / neuropharmacology 51 (2006) 923e932

compare  xxxg1113xxx  regulation in central and peripheral
systems, and not to propose blood platelets as an experimental
model for the study of neuronal regulation. there are intrinsic
differences between brain tissue and blood platelets that preclude comparison in absolute terms of the values of density
and affinity of [3h] xxxd2419xxx , the most obvious of which is
that the platelets lack a cell nucleus, which is involved in regulation of gene expression. furthermore, neuronal regulation
is very complex in terms of both cellular processes and integration of neuronal circuits, whereas blood platelets lack the
plasticity of neuronal regulation.
to further investigate the complex system of neuronal
regulation of the  xxxg1113xxx  after drug treatment, immunohistochemical studies were carried out with cerebral cortex.
4.2. changes in the neuronal distribution of 5-ht2a
receptors in the frontoparietal motor cortex
after olanzapine treatment
in control rats some 5-ht2a immunoreactive neuronal processes were observed in the upper cortical layers (i, ii and iii);
the somata and distal part of the apical dendrites of pyramidal
neurons of layer v also showed 5-ht2a immunoreactivity. in
addition, immunostained neurons that probably correspond to
gabaergic interneurons were observed. this pattern of immunoreactivity is consistent with previous findings in rats
(cornea-hebert et al., 1999; xu and pandey, 2000; santana
et al., 2004) and monkeys (jakab and goldman-rakic,
1998). in situ hybridization studies have shown that 5-ht2a
mrna is present in pyramidal cells of layer v and in numerous cortical neurons of layers iieiii and vi (mengod et al.,
1990; wright et al., 1995). the lack of 5-ht2a immunostaining in the cell body of neurons in layer iieiii may indicate
that in some cortical neuronal populations the receptor can
be synthesized in the somata and mainly expressed in
‘dendrites. the presence of 5-ht2a in specific domains of apical dendrites has previously been observed in rodents (corneahebert et al., 1999; xu and pandey, 2000; santana et al., 2004)
and primates (jakab and goldman-rakic, 1998). the presence
of  xxxg1113xxx  in the apical dendrites and varicose fibres
located in layers i and vi in untreated animals is consistent
with electron microscope observations in untreated animals,
which indicate that serotoninergic synaptic boutons are present
in the proximal and distal dendritic shafts, and varicose shafts
of local circuit neurons (jakab and goldman-rakic, 1998;
cornea-hebert et al., 1999).
there was an increase in 5-ht2a immunoreactivity in the
processes of upper cortical layers (ii and iii) in olanzapinetreated rats, after 24 and 48 h, as well as a decrease in the
immunolabelling of pyramidal cells in layer v. no changes
were observed in layers i and vi. all of this may indicate
that after 24 and 48 h of treatment, there was a decrease in
 xxxg1113xxx  expression in the somata and proximal part
of the apical dendrite and an increase in expression in the distal part. the results of ultrastructural studies (miner et al.,
2003) suggest that the apparent increase in 5-ht2a expression
observed in the supragranular layers would correspond to

a rise in the serotoninergic synaptic input, not only in the dendritic shaft, but also in dendritic spines, which would alter the
normal pattern of firing activity of pyramidal neurons, and
thus affect the output flow of information from the cortex.
after 16 days of treatment, 5-ht2a receptors were restricted to the somata of layer v and a few immunoreactive
neurons were present in layers ii and iii, and a characteristic
apparent lack of 5-ht2a immunostaining receptor in dendritic
processes. willins et al. (1999) reported that olanzapine and
other 5-ht2a antagonists induced a change in the subcellular
distribution of this receptor, both in vitro and in vivo. in a stably transfected nih 3t3 cell line, brief (30 min) exposure to
olanzapine caused an increase in intracellular 5-ht2a-like
immunoreactivity from the cellular membrane to perinuclear
cellular regions, which disappeared from the cellular membrane, as visualised by confocal microscopy. the same authors
also carried out in vivo studies in rats and showed that treatment with olanzapine at 20 mg/kg/day for 7 days caused internalization and cellular redistribution of  xxxg1113xxx  from
apical dendrites to intracellular compartments in the somata of
pyramidal glutamatergic neurons. the present findings showed
that olanzapine induced 5-ht2a immunoreactivity in the somata of pyramidal neurons, as well as in other somata with
non-pyramidal morphology after 16 days of treatment, which
indicates that the time-dependent cellular redistribution does
not only affect pyramidal neurons, as inhibitory gabaergic
interneurons are also regulated.
the present results therefore strongly suggest that olanzapine treatment is not only capable of regulating the density
of 5-ht2a receptors, as we have previously shown by binding
studies, but it can also induce time-dependent remodelling of
the synaptic circuits involved in the activity of pyramidal
and gabaergic inhibitory neurons. this remodelling can occur through changes in the subcellular transport from somata
to the dendrites, an idea that was previously suggested by
willins et al. (1999). it is possible that the reduction and redistribution of the  xxxg1113xxx  density observed after olanzapine treatment may induce changes in the dopaminergic
innervation that is regulated by serotonin, and may contribute
to the beneficial effects of the antipsychotic on the negative
symptoms and hypofrontality in schizophrenia.
4.3. effect of olanzapine treatment on dopamine d3
receptor mrna levels in cns and in blood lymphocytes
as previously mentioned,  xxxg657xxx  mrna may have
a potential use as a peripheral marker for schizophrenia (ilani
et al., 2001; kwak et al., 2001). to evaluate this, we analysed
the variations in  xxxg657xxx  mrna levels in the striatum, nucleus accumbens and lymphocytes after acute (24 and 48 h)
and subchronic (16 days) treatment with olanzapine.
olanzapine induced different regulation of  xxxg657xxx 
mrna levels in the different brain areas studied. in the nucleus accumbens of treated animals, the levels of d3 mrna
were significantly higher than in control tissues at 24
(p < 0.01) and 48 h (p < 0.05) and tended to decrease after
16 days, whereas no variations were observed in the striatum

j.f. padı́n et al. / neuropharmacology 51 (2006) 923e932

at any of the periods of treatment. previous studies of chronic
treatment of experimental animals with d3 antagonists have
provided contradictory results regarding regulation of these
receptors, with some reports of increased expression in certain
areas of the brain (lammers et al., 2000; rogoz et al., 2003),
and other reports of no changes in expression (joyce, 2001;
tarazi et al., 2001). such differences may be explained by
the occupation of d3 receptors by dopamine released by antipsychotic d3 antagonists during in vivo treatments (li et al.,
1998; zhang and bymaster, 1999), which along with the fact
that olanzapine is not distributed uniformly in all regions of
the brain, may explain the regional differences observed in
the regulation of the  xxxg657xxx  (aravagiri et al., 1999).
the observed increases in  xxxg657xxx  mrna in nucleus
accumbens but not in the striatum in the present study may
suggest that the dosage of antipsychotic drug used (equivalent
to a therapeutic dosage) has a greater effect on the mesolimbic
transmission than on striatum motor pathways, which would
favour improvement of positive psychotic symptoms without
unwanted extrapyramidal side effects by the drug.
similarly to the situation found in nucleus accumbens,
acute treatment with olanzapine (24 and 48 h) also resulted
in significant increases (p < 0.05 for 24 and p < 0.01 for
48 h of treatment) in  xxxg657xxx  mrna levels in a peripheral
cell system (lymphocytes), which validates interest in the peripheral receptor as a potential biomarker. parallel changes in
 xxxg657xxx  mrna levels by olanzapine in cns and peripheral cells may be explained, at least to certain extent, by the
synaptic plasticity that takes place via neurotrophic factors
such as  xxxg259xxx  (bdnf) in the
cns (fumagalli et al., 2003) and in the case of lymphocytes,
by the direct effect of the factor present in plasma (toyooka
et al., 2002), which may regulate  xxxg657xxx  mrna levels
(sokoloff et al., 2002).
the results of the present study showed that treatment of
sprague dawley rats with the atypical antipsychotic drug olanzapine at a dosage of 0.8 mg/kg/day resulted in: (1) parallelism in the regulation of the 5-ht2a receptors in frontal
cortex (bmax ¼ 76.2%, 83.0% and 46.0% of control after
24 h, 48 h and 16 days of treatment, respectively) and in blood
platelets (bmax z 55% of control at all times measured), and
a time-dependent remodelling of the synaptic circuits involved
in the activity of pyramidal and gabaergic neurons through
changes in subcellular transport processes from somata to
the dendrites; (2) parallelism in the regulation of  xxxg657xxx 
mrna levels, after 24 and 48 h of olanzapine treatment, in
the nucleus accumbens (increases of 52.5% and 21.1%, respectively) and in lymphocytes (increases of 53.4% and
91.7%, respectively), but not in striatum, and a return to levels
not significantly different from control levels in all tissues
after subchronic treatment.
the main novel observations made in the study were: (i) the
demonstration of parallel olanzapine-induced regulation of
5-ht2a and mrna d3 receptors in cns and peripheral blood
cells, which in the case of cns 5-ht2a receptors implies neuronal redistribution; (ii) regulation of  xxxg1113xxx  and
mrna d3 expression in both tissues following acute treatment

931

with olanzapine; (iii) regulation of  xxxg1113xxx  and
mrna d3 expression in peripheral tissues following subchronic treatment with olanzapine. the observation of parallel
regulation of these receptors in cns and peripheral blood cells
should encourage further studies of the validity of the receptors as biomarkers in the pharmacology of schizophrenia.
