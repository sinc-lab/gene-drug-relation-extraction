exenatide is a  xxxg873xxx  receptor agonist, which has recently
received fda approval in the us for the treatment of type 2 diabetes.
exenatide is an incretin mimetic that improves glycaemic control in patients
with diabetes through acute mechanisms, such as glucose-dependent stimulation of insulin secretion, suppression of inappropriate glucagon secretion
and slowing of gastric emptying, as well as chronic mechanisms that include
enhancement of beta-cell mass in rodent studies and weight loss and inhibition
of food intake in humans. this article reviews the mechanisms of exenatide
action, as well as its efficacy in the treatment of type 2 diabetes.

introduction

type 2 diabetes is characterised by both fasting and postprandial hyperglycaemia [1].
typically, hyperglycaemia results from the failure of beta-cells to adequately compensate for hepatic and peripheral (muscle) insulin resistance [2]. results from the
ukpds (united kingdom prospective diabetes study) indicate that beta-cell failure is
progressive, despite therapy with diet, insulin, sulfonylurea or metformin [3].
despite the number of therapeutic agents currently available for diabetes, glucose
control often remains inadequate, as average hba1c values reported in most epidemiological studies are well above 8% [4], compared with the goal level of < 7% set by
the american diabetes association [5]. this has led to a continuous search for new
treatments for type 2 diabetes, given the significant limitations of the available
therapeutic agents.
although several therapies are available for the treatment of type 2 diabetes, each
therapeutic agent has been associated with its specific adverse effects and contraindications. metformin is contraindicated in renal failure or in any other condition that
predisposes to lactic acidosis, and metformin therapy is associated with gastrointestinal side effects. sulfonylureas and insulin carry a substantial risk of hypoglycaemia
and cause weight gain. alpha-glucosidase inhibitors have significant gastrointestinal side
effects. the thiazolidinediones decrease hepatic and peripheral insulin resistance and
are effective in improving glycaemic control; however, therapy with thiazolidinediones is associated with fluid retention. for this reason, thiazolidinedione treatment is contraindicated in symptomatic heart failure (new york heart association
[nyha] class iii and iv).
a new class of anti-hyperglycaemic agents has recently been developed based on
the incretin effect. the incretin effect is defined as the increased stimulation of insulin secretion elicited by oral versus intravenous administration of glucose under similar plasma glucose levels. dupre and beck [6] demonstrated the incretin effect in
1966 by recognising that oral nutrient ingestion stimulated gut-derived signals that
were potent insulin secretagogues. patients with type 2 diabetes have been demonstrated to exhibit a loss of the incretin effect [7]. therefore, it is hypothesised that

exenatide

deficient incretin function plays an essential role in the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes. deficient incretin effect could be
due to the impaired secretion of incretin hormones, as well as
impaired effects on islet function.
 xxxg873xxx  (glp-1) is an incretin hormone
secreted mainly in the postprandial phase and is responsible for
augmenting insulin secretion in response to oral glucose [8].
subjects with type 2 diabetes or impaired glucose tolerance
exhibit significant reductions in levels of meal-stimulated circulating glp-1 [9], as well as lower baseline plasma glp-1 (7-37)
amide concentrations in comparison with nondiabetic individuals [10]. it has also been demonstrated that type 2 diabetic
subjects show an impaired response of glp-1 to oral glucose in
euglycaemic, isoinsulinemic conditions [10]. despite the blunting of glp-1 response to oral glucose and a reduction of
glp-1 levels in patients with type 2 diabetes, it has been
shown that beta-cell responsiveness to glucose may be increased to
normal levels with a low dose of glp-1 infusion. nevertheless,
the dose–response relationship between beta-cell responsiveness to
glucose and glp-1 is severely impaired in patients with type 2
diabetes [11]. treatment with exogenous glp-1 improves
glycaemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes [12].
glp-1 is derived from a larger proglucagon precursor that
encodes not only glp-1, but also glucagon, glp-2, oxyntomodulin and glicentin [13]. most glp-1 is produced within
intestinal l cells, which are located predominantly in the
ileum and colon [14]. plasma levels of glp-1 are low in the
fasting state and rise rapidly within minutes of food ingestion.
glp-1 secretion is directly correlated with insulin release and
is dependent on the rate of nutrient delivery. when glp-1 is
infused in type 2 diabetics, the insulinotropic effect of glp-1
is well preserved [15] and glp-1 has been shown to decrease
glucose levels [16,17], stimulate insulin secretion [18,19] and
decrease circulating plasma glucagon levels [18,20,21]. in addition, glp-1 delays gastric emptying [22,23] and reduces food
intake [24,25]. some, but not all, studies also suggest that
glp-1 improves insulin sensitivity [26-28]. furthermore,
glp-1 inhibits beta-cell apoptosis and improves glucose responsiveness of freshly isolated human islets [29]. glp-1 infusion
enhances beta-cell function and insulin secretion in human subjects with impaired glucose tolerance or type 2 diabetes [30].
insulin-treated diabetic subjects exhibit beta-cell glp-1 responsivity, with lowering of fasting and postprandial glucose in
association with enhanced insulin secretion [31].
glp-1-induced weight loss in preclinical experiments led
to an interest in the ability of such agents to diminish appetite and reduce weight in overweight human subjects.
healthy non-diabetic subjects, obese subjects, as well as
patients with type 2 diabetes show a significant reduction in
appetite and meal ingestion following glp-1 treatment [24,25].
the weight loss is associated with significant
glp-1-dependent reductions in energy consumption [32].
following the continuous infusion of glp-1 for 6 weeks in
obese type 2 diabetic subjects, reductions in appetite and
body weight (1.9 kg weight loss) were observed [33]. thus,
1056

glp-1 therapy in humans seems to be associated with
modest weight loss.
although single or repeated subcutaneous injections of
native glp-1 decrease blood glucose in human subjects, the
glucose-lowering effects are transient and last 1 – 2 h after peptide injection [20,34]. continuous intravenous or subcutaneous
infusion of glp-1 in short- and long-term studies has been
shown to be highly effective in lowering blood glucose in diabetic subjects [35], but this intensive and expensive approach has
major limitations for the treatment of large numbers of diabetic
patients. it has become apparent that the short plasma half-life
of glp-1 was a significant barrier to clinical development.
glp-1 is cleaved by the widely expressed ubiquitous enzyme
aminopeptidase  xxxg651xxx  ( xxxg651xxx ) in capillary
endothelial cells [36-38]. therefore, the half-life of exogenously
infused glp-1 is only ∼ 2 min in both non-diabetic subjects
and type 2 diabetic patients [39]. chronic hyperglycaemia
induces a significant increase in  xxxg651xxx  activity in both type 1
and type 2 diabetes. this phenomenon could contribute to the
reduction in circulating active glp-1 and to the consequent
postprandial hyperglycaemia in type 2 diabetic patients with
poor metabolic control [40]. the short plasma half-life of circulating glp-1 was a significant barrier to the development of
glp-1 as a therapeutic agent for type 2 diabetes, and led to the
clinical development of degradation-resistant  xxxg899xxx 
agonists with longer durations of action in vivo.  xxxg651xxx -resistant  xxxg899xxx  agonists, such as exenatide, have recently
been developed for the treatment of type 2 diabetes with
encouraging results.

introduction to the compound

2.1 chemistry

 xxxd2076xxx , the naturally-occurring form of exenatide, is a
potent  xxxg899xxx  agonist.  xxxd2076xxx  was originally isolated from the salivary secretions of the lizard, heloderma suspectum, commonly known as the gila monster [41]. in the gila
monster,  xxxd2076xxx  circulates after the animal bites its prey,
and may have endocrine functions related to digestion and
energy assimilation [42].  xxxd2076xxx  is a naturally-occurring
39 amino acid peptide and has a 53% amino acid sequence
overlap with mammalian glp-1, but is the product of a separate gene, distinct from the proglucagon gene from which lizard glp-1 is expressed in the gila monster [43]. in mammals,
 xxxd2076xxx  is resistant to proteolytic degradation by  xxxg651xxx 
and has a much longer plasma half-life than glp-1.
exenatide and glp-1 share many glucoregulatory actions,
which may be mediated by the pancreatic  xxxg899xxx  [44].
the  xxxg899xxx  ( xxxg899xxx ) is a 463 amino acid
seven-transmembrane-spanning, g-protein-coupled receptor,
and was first cloned from a rat pancreatic islet cdna
library [45,46]. distribution of the mammalian  xxxg899xxx 
includes pancreatic periductal and b cells, kidney, heart,
stomach and brain [47]. the pancreatic  xxxg899xxx  binds
 xxxd2076xxx  and glp-1 with equal affinity in in vitro assays,

briones & bajaj

and both peptides stimulate the receptor equipotently in
human receptor systems [48]. it may be emphasised that some
of the effects of  xxxd2076xxx  are mediated through receptors
other than the classic  xxxg899xxx  [49]
pharmacokinetics and metabolism
plasma exenatide concentrations increase in a dose-dependent manner after single subcutaneous doses. in a single-blind, placebo-controlled, rising-dose study [50], eight
type 2 diabetic patients received four escalating single doses
of exenatide or placebo. patients were randomised to one of
four treatment sequences consisting of a single dose of each of
the following: placebo, exenatide 0.1 µg/kg, exenatide 0.2 µg/kg,
exenatide 0.3 µg/kg, and either exenatide 0.4 µg/kg or an additional dose of placebo. exenatide was injected subcutaneously at approximately 08:00 on each of the 5 days the drug
was administered (days 1, 3, 5, 7 and 9). immediately after
injection of exenatide, patients received a defined-calorie
enteral nutrition formula (7 kcal/kg) to drink completely
within 5 min. plasma exenatide concentrations seemed to
exhibit dose-proportional kinetics, reaching peak concentrations between 2 and 3 h, and were still detectable 15 h postdose with doses of 0.2 mg/kg and higher, confirming the
prolonged half-life of exenatide in vivo, consistent with its
resistance to degradation by  xxxg651xxx . in addition, exenatide
was detectable in plasma as early as 10 – 15 min following
the injection, demonstrating its rapid absorption after subcutaneous injection. for patients receiving exenatide doses
of > 0.2 µg/kg, a dose-dependent increase in nausea was
observed. the t½ and tmax values of exenatide were not significantly affected by dose. mean t½ values were in the range
of 3.3 – 4.0 h, and mean tmax values were in the range of
2.1 – 2.2 h. plasma glucose was dose-dependently lowered
by subcutaneous exenatide administration during the 2 h
after a meal.
based on its prolonged in vivo t½ in the range of 2 – 4 h,
twice-daily subcutaneous administration of exenatide is necessary in patients with type 2 diabetes [51] and once-daily dosing is
insufficient [52]. mean cmax levels for exenatide was 211 pg/ml
and overall mean auc0-∝ was 1036 pg•h/ml following
subcutaneous administration of a 10 µg dose [53].
in patients with type 2 diabetes, subcutaneous administration of exenatide into the abdomen, arm or thigh results in
similar absorption and comparable bioavailability [54]. the
mean apparent volume of distribution of exenatide following
subcutaneous administration of a single dose is 28.3 l [53].
exenatide is predominantly eliminated by glomerular filtration with subsequent proteolytic degradation. the mean
apparent clearance of exenatide in humans is 9.1 l/h and the
mean terminal half-life is 2.4 h, independent of dose [53].
exenatide clearance is only mildly reduced in patients with
mild-to-moderate renal impairment (creatinine clearance
30 – 80 ml/min). however, in patients with end-stage renal
disease receiving dialysis, mean exenatide clearance is
significantly reduced [53].

2.2

pharmacodynamics
glucoregulatory actions of exenatide include glucose-dependent enhancement of insulin secretion [50,55-57], glucose-dependent suppression of inappropriately high glucagon
secretion [50,57], slowing of gastric emptying [50,57] and reduction in food intake [58,59]. in addition,  xxxd2076xxx  has been
shown to promote beta-cell proliferation and islet cell neogenesis
from precursor cells in both in vitro and in vivo models of
type 2 diabetes [60,61]. these glucoregulatory actions of  xxxd2076xxx , combined with enhanced pharmacokinetics, result in
very high in vivo potency relative to native glp-1 [62].
in phase ii studies in patients with type 2 diabetes on diet
control, or previously treated with oral hypoglycaemic therapy
or insulin, exenatide injected subcutaneously rapidly lowered
both fasting and postprandial plasma glucose for 5 h [57]. during fasting, glucose-dependent enhancement of insulin secretion and suppression of glucagon secretion are the
predominant mechanisms, and postprandially, slowing of gastric emptying is additionally operative. the glucose-dependent insulinotropism exhibited by exenatide in the fasting state
is associated with a enhanced insulin secretion and the prevailing glucose concentration is elevated (first 3 h) and a gradual
fall in insulin secretion with reestablishment of near basal
insulinaemia when the prevailing glucose concentration
decreases to the near normal range (beyond the first 3 h).

clinical efficacy

glycaemic control
fineman et al. [51] studied the effect of exenatide treatment in
patients with type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled on oral
sulfonylurea and/or metformin treatment. in total,
109 patients treated with diet and a sulfonylurea and/or metformin were randomly assigned to receive exenatide
0.08 µg/kg b.i.d. at breakfast and dinner, 0.08 µg/kg b.i.d. at
breakfast and bedtime, 0.08 µg/kg t.i.d. or placebo for
28 days. all three exenatide regimens led to a significant
reduction in hba1c (0.7 – 1.1%). in addition, 15% of type 2
diabetic patients achieved the hba1c goal of ≤ 7% (4%
with placebo) and significant reductions in postprandial
hyperglycaemia were noted following exenatide treatment.
three pivotal phase iii studies have examined the effects of
exenatide in combination with metformin, sulfonylurea or in
combination with both in type 2 diabetic patients. these
were 30-week randomised, triple-blind, placebo-controlled studies with a similar study design. in the first of these studies [63],
the effect of exenatide on glycaemic control in patients with
type 2 diabetes failing to achieve glycaemic control with maximally effective metformin doses (> 1500 mg/day) was evaluated. overall, 336 patients were randomised to receive
exenatide 5 µg or placebo subcutaneously twice daily for
4 weeks, followed by exenatide 5 or 10 µg or placebo subcutaneously twice daily for 26 weeks. at the end of the study,
hba1c values declined by 0.8% in those patients that received
exenatide 10µg b.i.d. and 0.4% in those who received
3.1

exenatide

exenatide 5 µg b.i.d., compared with a mean increase of 0.1%
for the placebo-treated patient group. by week 30, 46% of the
patients that received exenatide 10 µg b.i.d. and 32% of the
patients that received exenatide 5 µg b.i.d. achieved hba1c ≤
7%. exenatide-treated subjects displayed progressive
dose-dependent weight loss (1.6 – 2.8 kg). the most frequent
adverse events were gastrointestinal in nature and generally
mild-to-moderate. nausea was the most frequent severe
adverse event, and it was higher in exenatide- than placebo-treated subjects. incidence of mild-to-moderate
hypoglycaemia was low and similar across treatment arms,
with no severe hypoglycaemia.
in the second of three pivotal phase iii studies, the effects
of exenatide were assessed in 377 patients with type 2 diabetes unresponsive to maximally effective doses of sulfonylurea
treatment [64]. at the end of the study, hba1c decreased by
0.9 and 0.5% in those patients who received exenatide 10 and
5 µg b.i.d., respectively, and increased by 0.1% in the placebo
group. exenatide 10 µg b.i.d. reduced hba1c levels to ≤ 7%
in 41% of patients, whereas 33% of the patients that received
exenatide 5 µg b.i.d. were able to achieve a similar glycaemic
goal. patients that received exenatide also demonstrated
significant reductions in body weight.
in the third phase iii trial, exenatide was evaluated in
733 type 2 diabetics that were unable to achieve glycaemic
control with metformin and sulfonylurea combination treatment [65]. patients in each treatment group were further randomised into two groups; one group maintained their
maximally effective dose of sulfonylurea unless reduction was
necessitated by hypoglycaemia, and the other group reduced
their sulfonylurea dose before starting the study medication
and later titrated the sulfonylurea dose to maximise glucose
control. overall, 34 and 27% of the patients on exenatide
10 and 5 µg b.i.d., respectively, reduced their hba1c levels to
< 7%, despite having failed to reach treatment goals on two
oral agents prior to entering the study. placebo-adjusted
reductions of hba1c were 1.0 and 0.8% in patients who
received exenatide 10 and 5 µg b.i.d., respectively. both
exenatide arms demonstrated significant weight loss (1.6 kg).
mild or moderate nausea was the most frequent adverse event.
combination therapy with insulin and exenatide in
patients with type 2 diabetes has not been evaluated in phase
iii studies and exenatide is not approved by the fda for use
in combination with insulin.
insulin secretion
fineman et al. [51] used the homeostasis model assessment
methodology to assess beta-cell function at baseline and at
days 14 and 28 in patients with type 2 diabetes receiving
two or three daily subcutaneous injections of exenatide
(0.08 µg/kg body weight). homeostasis model assessment
(homa) analysis revealed enhanced beta-cell function
following exenatide therapy. beta-cell index (homa) was
significantly higher at 14 and 28 days for patients treated
with exenatide.
3.2

1058

defronzo et al. [63] demonstrated beneficial effects of
exenatide on beta-cell function, evidenced by a significant decrease
in the  xxxg1193xxx -to-insulin ratio in subjects receiving 10 µg
b.i.d. and a similar insulin secretory response to meal challenge,
despite lower fasting and postprandial glucose concentrations.
similar dose-dependent decreases in the  xxxg1193xxx -to-insulin
ratio were also observed in other studies [64].
type 2 diabetes is characterised by a significant reduction
in first-phase insulin, which contributes to postprandial
hyperglycaemia [66]. fehse et al. [67] recently demonstrated
the ability of intravenous exenatide to restore first phase
insulin secretion in response to intravenous glucose in
patients with type 2 diabetes.
glucagon secretion
circulating fasting and postprandial plasma glucagon concentrations were reduced following exenatide treatment in
patients with type 2 diabetes; however, suppression of fasting plasma glucagon levels did not extend beyond 3 h
post-exenatide treatment [57]. similarly, the available insulin
secretagogues, as well as exogenous insulin, do not suppress
the paradoxical postprandial glucagon rise observed in
patients with diabetes [68]. this inappropriate elevation in
postprandial plasma glucagon concentration results in an
inappropriately low insulin-to-glucagon ratio in the hepatic
portal vein, contributing to sustained rates of excess hepatic
glucose production [69-71]. the ability of exenatide to
enhance endogenous insulin and lower glucagon secretion
tends to reestablish a more physiological and favourable portal vein ratio of insulin-to-glucagon as compared with other
available agents.
3.3

enhanced beta-cell mass
one of the most provocative areas of recent research is based
on the observation that  xxxd2076xxx  may improve beta-cell mass,
thereby impeding or even reversing disease progression. a
number of published reports support the concept that  xxxd2076xxx  and glp-1 increase beta-cell mass via stimulation of beta-cell
neogenesis, stimulation of beta-cell proliferation and suppression
of beta-cell apoptosis [72]. multipotent progenitor cells in the
pancreatic islets and ducts, so-called nestin-positive
islet-derived progenitor cells, express functional glp-1 receptors. glp-1 stimulates the differentiation of nestin-positive
islet-derived progenitor cells into insulin-producing cells [73].
treatment of these cells with  xxxd2076xxx  produced a two- to
threefold increase in insulin secretion. locally-produced
glp-1 may act as an autocrine/paracrine developmental morphogen on receptors on nestin-positive islet-derived progenitor cells, resulting in the expression of the  xxxg1193xxx  gene,
conferring a beta-cell phenotype. zhou et al. [74] reported that
both  xxxd2076xxx  and glp-1 can induce ar42j cells (which are
derived from a pancreatic tumour and in their basal state are
negative for islet hormones) to differentiate into cells positive
for insulin,  xxxg1823xxx  and glucagon. when these
cells were exposed to glp-1, intracellular camp levels and
3.4

briones & bajaj

cell proliferation increased over the first 24 h, up to 50% of
the cells became positive for islet hormones and insulin was
detectable in the cell culture medium in response to glucose.
 xxxd2076xxx  caused the same cellular changes as glp-1, and
with a 10-fold higher potency. hence,  xxxd2076xxx  can induce
pancreatic precursor cells to differentiate into insulin and glucagon-secreting islet cells in vitro. in addition, glp-1 protects
beta cells against cell death induced by elevated glucose and/or
non-esterified  xxxd2154xxx  [75]. despite evidence implicating
 xxxg899xxx  signalling as an important pathway for regulating
beta-cell proliferation and survival, beta-cell mass is normal in
 xxxg899xxx  knockout mice ( xxxg899xxx -/- mice). however,
 xxxg899xxx -/- mice exhibit abnormalities in islet number, islet
size and distribution of alpha cells [76].
in a rodent model of type 2 diabetes (partial pancreatectomy), the daily administration of  xxxd2076xxx  for 10 days postpancreatectomy attenuated the development of diabetes [60].
in  xxxd2076xxx -treated rats, glucose levels were maintained at
levels 40% lower than untreated rats for the entire 2.5-week
observation period following the cessation of treatment, independent of changes in body weight.  xxxd2076xxx  stimulated
pancreatic regeneration by a 40% expansion of beta-cell mass in
treated rats.
neonatal wistar rats injected with  xxxd3249xxx  (stz) at
birth were examined to study whether early exposure to  xxxd2076xxx  or glp-1 could promote beta-cell regeneration and consequently improve islet function in adults [61]. following 7 days
of treatment, both  xxxd2076xxx  and glp-1 decreased plasma
glucose levels and increased pancreatic insulin content. at
2 months of age, stz rats treated with either  xxxd2076xxx  or
glp-1 had plasma glucose levels comparable to healthy wistar rats, whereas untreated stz rats had significantly higher
plasma glucose concentrations. fasting pancreatic insulin content was higher after  xxxd2076xxx  and glp-1 treatments. there
were increases in beta-cell mass that were attributable to cell proliferation, but not hypertrophy. li et al. [77] examined whether
 xxxg899xxx  activation could inhibit beta-cell apoptosis. healthy mice
were treated with low-dose stz to induce beta-cell apoptosis, and
this effect was greatly ameliorated by  xxxd2076xxx .
in summary, there is considerable evidence in rodent studies
that exogenously administered  xxxd2076xxx  may play an important
role in improving beta-cell mass and function through complementary actions to stimulate islet cell proliferation and neogenesis, and to inhibit islet cell apoptosis. recent studies suggest that
this effect is mediated via the  xxxg899xxx , as mice lacking a
functional  xxxg899xxx  do not exhibit beta-cell regeneration
following  xxxd2076xxx  treatment [78]. however, a more detailed
analysis of pancreatic beta-cell function in long-term treatment
with exenatide will be necessary to better characterise the
potential positive effects of exenatide on the beta-cell in humans.
gastric emptying
in patients with diabetes, gastric emptying can range from
excessively slow (gastroparesis) to accelerated. studies have
shown that at comparable glucose concentrations, accelerated
3.5

gastric emptying is common in patients with diabetes when
compared with non-diabetic subjects. phillips et al. [79] demonstrated that gastric emptying was more rapid in patients with
type 2 diabetes compared with healthy non-diabetic control
subjects. the importance of glp-1 on delaying gastric emptying and improving postprandial plasma glucose control was recognised by willms et al. [23], who demonstrated improved
postprandial glucose levels following glp-1 administration in
type 2 diabetic patients. some studies also suggest a predominant role for delayed gastric emptying in reducing postprandial
glucose levels following glp-1 treatment in healthy non-diabetic subjects [80]. continuous subcutaneous infusion of glp-1
for 6 weeks has been demonstrated to delay gastric emptying in
patients with type 2 diabetes [26]. similar effects on gastric
emptying have also been observed following treatment with
exenatide in type 2 diabetic patients [57]. kolterman et al. [50]
demonstrated dose-dependent slowing of gastric emptying in
type 2 diabetic subjects treated with exenatide.
nutrient intake and body weight
exenatide has been shown to acutely reduce food intake in
healthy non-diabetic subjects by 19% [59]. in phase iii studies, exenatide treatment (10 µg b.i.d.) elicited dose-dependent
reductions in body weight (∼ 3%) [63] in association with
improved glycaemic control in metformin treated type 2 diabetic patients. weight loss was independent of nausea and
food intake was not measured in these studies. similarly, type
2 diabetic patients on sulfonylurea treatment who received
exenatide 10 µg b.i.d. had an average weight loss of 1.6 kg
over the 30-week study period [64]. patients with type 2
diabetes on sulfonylurea and metformin combination therapy
also demonstrated a progressive weight loss following
administration of exenatide 5 and 10 µg b.i.d. [65].

insulin sensitivity
the effects of  xxxd2076xxx  and glp-1 on insulin sensitivity in
peripheral tissues are currently under active investigation.
some [26,27,81], but not all, studies [82] have demonstrated
that glp-1 improves insulin action. whether this action is
mediated by a direct effect on insulin responsive tissues to
enhance glucose uptake, or is secondary to improvement in
glycaemic control, reduced glucose toxicity and/or reduced
body weight, remains to be elucidated. exenatide has been
shown to improve insulin sensitivity, independent of
decreasing glucose and body weight in insulin-resistant
obese fa/fa zucker rats [83].

safety and tolerability

hypoglycaemia
the glp-1-induced suppression of glucagon secretion suggests the possibility that glp-1 therapy may be associated
with an increased risk of hypoglycaemia and defective glucose
counter-regulation. although acute administration of glp-1
to non-diabetic subjects in the fasting state was associated

exenatide

with mild hypoglycaemia in some subjects [84], appropriate
glucagon responses to hypoglycaemia do not seem to be
blunted in glp-1 treated subjects, and glp-1 infusion does
not impair normal counter-regulatory responses to hypoglycaemia in healthy non-diabetic subjects [85].
fineman et al. [51] examined the effect of exenatide
0.08 µg/kg b.i.d. or t.i.d. for 28 days in combination with sulfonylurea and/or metformin, and reported that 15% of
patients experienced hypoglycaemia; all of these subjects
received sulfonylurea treatment in combination with  xxxd2076xxx . defronzo et al. [63] reported that combining exenatide
with metformin treatment in type 2 diabetic patients did not
increase the risk of hypoglycaemia, despite a significant reduction in hba1c. combining exenatide with sulfonyurea treatment was associated with a 36% incidence of
mild-to-moderate hypoglycaemia in those type 2 diabetic
patients who received exenatide 10 µg b.i.d., but no cases of
severe hypoglycaemia were reported in this study [64].
hypoglycaemia occurred more readily in the exenatide-treated
patients in a dose-dependent fashion. kendall et al. [65]
reported a similar incidence of mild/moderate hypoglycaemia
in patients with type 2 diabetes in whom exenatide was
added to metformin/sulfonylurea combination therapy (28%
in the patients who received exenatide 10 µg b.i.d.). these
studies suggest that exenatide itself does not seem to intrinsically increase the risk of hypoglycaemia because, when added
to a background of metformin therapy, there was no increase
in reported hypoglycaemia, despite an improvement in overall
glycaemic control [63]. the mild/moderate hypoglycaemia
observed when exenatide was added to sulfonylurea therapy
was likely to be caused by the background susceptibility to
hypoglycaemia often observed in sulfonylurea-treated patients
coupled with lower ambient glycaemia. these findings suggest that a proactive approach to sulfonylurea dose management is likely to limit the incidences of hypoglycaemia in
exenatide-treated patients, that is, initial reduction of dosage
of a sulfonylurea may limit the risk of hypoglycaemia associated with such therapies upon initiation of exenatide treatment, even when retitration to maximal dose therapy is
subsequently permitted.
nausea
in a phase i study in 40 healthy volunteers, single ascending
doses of exenatide subcutaneous injection 0.01 – 0.1 µg/kg
were well tolerated, whereas tolerability of higher doses up to
0.3 µg/kg was limited by nausea and vomiting [86]. gradual
dose escalation of exenatide successfully reduced the proportion
4.2

1060

of subjects experiencing dose-limiting nausea and vomiting,
with no loss of glucoregulatory activity [87].
in phase iii studies, the most common treatment-emergent adverse event was dose-related nausea. mild-to-moderate nausea was reported in up to 48% of the type 2 diabetic
patients treated with exenatide [65], and the incidence of
severe nausea was low (3% of subjects who received
exenatide 10 µg b.i.d.) [63]. the incidence of nausea was
highest at initiation and became less frequent with subsequent dosing [63-65]. there was no correlation between
change in body weight and duration of nausea [63].
pregnancy and lactation
exenatide has been shown to cause reduced fetal and neonatal
growth and skeletal effects in mice at systemic exposure three
times the human exposure. there are no adequate and
well-controlled studies in pregnant women. exenatide should
be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies
the potential risk to the fetus (category c) [53].
it is not known whether exenatide is excreted in human
milk. studies in lactating mice have demonstrated that
exenatide is present at low concentrations in milk. caution
should be exercised when exenatide is administered to
lactating women [53].
4.3

5.

conclusion

exenatide has actions that significantly improve glycaemic control in type 2 diabetes by mechanism that include enhancing
glucose-dependent stimulation of insulin secretion, suppression
of glucagon secretion, enhancement of pancreatic islet health,
slowing of gastric emptying and reduction of food intake.
6.

expert opinion

chronic exenatide treatment lowers blood glucose and hba1c
in type 2 diabetic subjects in association with a decrease in
body weight. although exenatide produces remarkable effects
on beta-cell proliferation and cytoprotection in rodent studies,
and human beta-cells exhibit proliferative and cytoprotective
responses to exenatide in vitro, the potential for exenatide to
prevent progression to beta-cell failure in diabetic subjects is
intriguing but, as yet, remains to be investigated [14]. the current need for twice daily injections of exenatide raises acceptance and compliance issues for prolonged therapy with this
agent. however, the potential beneficial effects on beta-cell
function and mass may far outweigh these inconveniences.
