abstract
objective: to review the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, safety, and efficacy of  xxxd99xxx , a glucagon-like peptide-1
receptor agonist (glp-1 ra) in type 2 diabetes ( xxxd797xxx ). data sources: a medline search (1950-june 2014) was
conducted using the keyword  xxxd99xxx . references were reviewed to identify additional sources. study selection
and data extraction: articles evaluating pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, safety, or efficacy of  xxxd99xxx  were
included. data synthesis:  xxxd99xxx  is a long-acting glp-1 ra that lowers glycosylated hemoglobin (a1c) and reduces
weight by stimulating glucose-dependent insulin secretion, suppressing glucagon secretion, delaying gastric emptying, and
promoting satiety.  xxxd99xxx  has a long half-life as a result of resistance to degradation by dipeptidyl peptidase-4 and
fusion to albumin, thus allowing once-weekly dosing.  xxxd99xxx  has been studied as monotherapy and add-on therapy
to metformin, sulfonylureas, thiazolidinediones,  xxxd2362xxx , and varying combinations of these agents. clinical studies
have shown  xxxd99xxx  to be superior to placebo, sitagliptin, and  xxxd2203xxx  and noninferior to  xxxd2362xxx  and insulin
lispro at reducing a1c in  xxxd797xxx  patients, with a1c changes from baseline ranging from −0.55% to −0.9%. noninferiority
was not achieved when compared to  xxxd2495xxx  and pioglitazone. weight changes ranged from +0.28 to −1.21 kg. the most
common side effects are upper-respiratory-tract infections, diarrhea, nausea, and injection-site reactions. conclusion:
 xxxd99xxx  is the fourth glp-1 ra approved in the united states. advantages include once-weekly dosing and fewer
gastrointestinal side effects compared with  xxxd2495xxx , but it is less effective at reducing a1c and weight compared to
 xxxd2495xxx . it has not been compared head to head with other glp-1 ras.

introduction
diabetes affects 382 million people worldwide and more
than 25 million people in the united states alone.1,2 type 2
diabetes ( xxxd797xxx ) accounts for up to 95% of all cases.1
diabetes is a major cause of heart disease and stroke and the
leading cause of kidney failure, nontraumatic lower-limb
amputations, and new cases of blindness in adults in the
united states.1 the current position statement from the
american diabetes association (ada) and european
association for the study of diabetes (easd) recommends
an individualized, patient-centered approach to treatment.3
metformin and lifestyle modifications are preferred for
most patients as initial therapy. second-line treatment
options include sulfonylureas, thiazolidinediones, glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (glp-1 ras), dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (dpp-4) inhibitors, and insulin. the choice
between second-line options should be based on patient and
drug characteristics, with the goal of improving glycemic
control while minimizing adverse effects. despite this wide

array of treatment options, glycemic control remains challenging. multiple medications with complementary mechanisms of action are often required for patients to achieve
adequate glycemic control, and side effects such as hypoglycemia, weight gain, and gastrointestinal (gi) problems
limit the benefits of many treatment options.3 because of
the increasing prevalence of  xxxd797xxx , the complexity of its
pathogenesis, the progressive nature of the disease, and the
limitations of available treatment options, the development
and approval of new  xxxd797xxx  medications continues to be
needed.

trujillo and nuffer
the discovery of the incretin hormones and the subsequent development of the glp-1 ras and dpp-4 inhibitors
were significant advances in the treatment of  xxxd797xxx . glp-1 is
an endogenous incretin hormone that stimulates glucosedependent insulin secretion, suppresses glucagon secretion,
delays gastric emptying, and promotes satiety. however,
native glp-1 is rapidly inactivated by dpp-4, thereby limiting its therapeutic potential. glp-1 ras exert their incretin mimetic effects while being resistant to inactivation by
dpp-4, thus allowing them to be administered once or twice
daily or once weekly. glp-1 ras, as a class, are attractive
options because they improve glycemic control and reduce
weight, with minimal risk of hypoglycemia. there are 3
glp-1 ras currently available in the united states; exenatide twice daily (byetta),  xxxd2495xxx  once daily ( xxxd2495xxx ),
and exenatide once weekly ( xxxd2076xxx ).
 xxxd99xxx  ( xxxd99xxx , glaxosmithkline) is the newest
glp-1 ra and is indicated to improve glycemic control in
adults with  xxxd797xxx .  xxxd99xxx  lowers glycosylated hemoglobin (a1c) and weight and is administered as a subcutaneous (sc) injection once weekly via a pen device. the food
and drug administration (fda) approved  xxxd99xxx  for
the treatment of  xxxd797xxx  on april 15, 2014. the objective of
this article is to review the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, safety, and efficacy of  xxxd99xxx  in  xxxd797xxx .

data sources
a medline search (1950-june 2014) was conducted
using the keyword  xxxd99xxx . all articles published in
english identified from the data sources were evaluated,
prioritizing randomized controlled trials with human data.
references of identified articles were reviewed to find any
additional sources. additional data were obtained from the
manufacturer and published abstracts of phase 3 trial data.
articles evaluating the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics,
safety, or efficacy of  xxxd99xxx  for the treatment of  xxxd797xxx 
were included.

pharmacology
 xxxd99xxx  is a long-acting glp-1 ra consisting of 2 copies of a 30-amino acid sequence of a human glp-1 dimer
genetically fused to  xxxd100xxx .4 resistance to dpp-4
degradation is achieved by a single amino acid substitution
(glycine to alanine) at the eighth position. the fusion to
albumin and the amino acid substitution both result in a longer half-life and, thus, the need for less-frequent dosing.4
 xxxd99xxx  has a molecular weight of 72 970.5
patients with  xxxd797xxx  often have reduced levels of glp-1
compared with patients without  xxxd797xxx . therefore,  xxxd99xxx 
lowers glucose by acting as an incretin mimetic, specifically a glp-1 ra, thus promoting glucose-dependent insulin secretion, suppressing glucagon secretion, slowing
gastric emptying, and promoting satiety. as a long acting

glp-1 ra, it lowers both fasting and postprandial glucose
levels. although the fusion to albumin increases the halflife of the drug, this fusion to such a large molecule could
potentially affect the drug’s interaction with the glp-1
receptor. studies in mice suggest that the effects of  xxxd99xxx  on gastric emptying and satiety may be blunted because
of the molecule’s size.6

pharmacodynamics and
pharmacokinetics
an overview of pharmacokinetic parameters observed in
patients with  xxxd797xxx  is provided in table 1. maximum concentrations of  xxxd99xxx  were reached 3 to 5 days after a
single 30-mg sc dose.5 steady-state concentrations are
achieved after 4 to 5 weeks of once-weekly administration.
similar concentrations are achieved with sc adminis-tration in the abdomen, thigh, and upper arm.7 the elimination
half-life is approximately 5 to 7 days, making it suitable for
once-weekly administration.5,7,8
a phase i dose escalation study was conducted in 39
healthy adults to determine the pharmacokinetics and initial
safety and tolerability of  xxxd99xxx .4 participants were randomized to receive escalating doses of  xxxd99xxx  or placebo on days 1 and 8 in 5 different dose cohorts (cohort 1:
0.25 + 1 mg; cohort 2: 3 + 6 mg; cohort 3: 16 + 24 mg;
cohort 4: 48 + 60 mg; cohort 5: 80 + 104 mg). results
showed that  xxxd99xxx  had a terminal elimination half-life
of 6 to 8 days and a time to maximum observed plasma drug
concentration (tmax) of 3 to 4 days. a dose-dependent reduction in mean plasma glucose was observed with significant
decreases in higher-dose treatment arms.
seino and colleagues8 conducted a randomized, singleblind, placebo-controlled study of 40 japanese patients with
 xxxd797xxx . patients were randomized to receive  xxxd99xxx  15
mg once weekly, 30 mg once weekly, 50 mg every other
week, 100 mg every 4 weeks, or placebo. the median halflife was 5.3 days. a1c was significantly improved from
baseline in all treatment groups compared with placebo on
day 29 (−0.58%, −0.57%, −0.63%, −0.51%; all p < 0.03 vs
placebo). fasting plasma glucose (fpg) was significantly
reduced from baseline in all treatment groups except the

100-mg group compared with placebo. greater glucose
variability was seen in the biweekly and monthly dosing
groups. less gi adverse effects were seen in the 30-mg
weekly group compared with other treatment groups.
matthews et al7 conducted a randomized, single-blind,
placebo-controlled study of 54 patients with  xxxd797xxx . patients
were randomized to receive 9, 16, or 32 mg of  xxxd99xxx 
on day 1 and day 8. the half-life ranged between 6 and 7
days. fasting and postprandial glucose levels were reduced
in a dose-dependent fashion compared with placebo.
rosenstock et al9 conducted a randomized, double-blind,
parallel-group study of 3 different dosing schedules of  xxxd99xxx  in 356 patients with  xxxd797xxx . patients were randomized
to sc placebo or  xxxd99xxx  weekly (4, 15, or 30 mg),
biweekly (15, 30, or 50mg), or monthly (50 or 100mg).
a1c was reduced in all  xxxd99xxx  groups in a dosedependent fashion. the 30-mg weekly, 50-mg biweekly,
and 100-mg monthly schedules of  xxxd99xxx  resulted in
similar a1c reductions from baseline (−0.87, −0.79, −0.87)
versus placebo (−0.17, p < 0.004). less gi adverse effects
were seen in the 30-mg weekly schedule compared with
other treatment groups. the half-life of  xxxd99xxx  was 5
days in this study, and steady-state concentrations were
achieved in 4 to 5 weeks.
seino et al10 conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study of 3 different dosing
schedules of  xxxd99xxx  in 215 japanese patients with  xxxd797xxx .
patients were randomized to  xxxd99xxx  15 mg weekly, 30
mg weekly, or 30 mg biweekly or placebo for 16 weeks.
change in a1c from baseline was significantly better for all
treatment groups compared with placebo (−0.63, −1.29,
−0.84, +0.27, respectively; p < 0.0001).
 xxxd99xxx  is a protein that is expected to be degraded to
small peptides and amino acids by proteolytic enzymes.
increases in  xxxd99xxx  exposure of approximately 30% to
40% have been observed in patients with severe renal
impairment. clinical trials examining the effects of hepatic
impairment on the pharmacokinetics of  xxxd99xxx  have not
been done. in drug-drug interaction studies, no significant
changes in exposures or pharmacodynamic effects were
identified with digoxin, oral contraceptives, or warfarin.11
when  xxxd99xxx  was coadministered with simvastatin, the
cmax of simvastatin and its active metabolite were increased
by 18% and 98%, respectively. the area under the curve
(auc) of simvastatin was decreased by 40%, and the auc
of its active metabolite was increased by 36%.5 the clinical
significance of these interactions is unknown.

clinical trials
approval by the fda was based on results from 8 phase 3
trials (harmony 1-8) evaluating weekly doses of 30 to
50 mg of  xxxd99xxx  compared with and in combination
with commonly used  xxxd797xxx  treatments in more than 5000

patients. a summary of the harmony clinical trial
results related to a1c and weight is provided in table 2.
one study evaluated  xxxd99xxx  monotherapy,12 whereas
the others included patients on a variety of other background therapies.13-19  xxxd99xxx  has been compared with
placebo,12,18,19 sitagliptin,14,15 sulfonylureas,14 pioglitazone,19,  xxxd2495xxx ,17  xxxd2362xxx ,16 and insulin lispro.13 currently, only 3 of the 8 harmony trials have
been published in full.17 the other 5 trials have been presented nationally or internationally and published in
abstract form.

monotherapy
in the harmony 2 study, once-weekly monotherapy with
 xxxd99xxx  reduced a1c from baseline significantly better
than placebo in drug-naïve patients with  xxxd797xxx  inadequately
controlled with diet and exercise alone.12 treatment difference in the change in a1c from baseline ( xxxd99xxx  vs placebo) was −0.84% for the 30-mg weekly dose and −1.04%
for the 50-mg weekly dose (p < 0.0001 for both). the effect
was durable for the 52-week study period. weight decreased
modestly in both the  xxxd99xxx  and placebo groups ( xxxd99xxx  30 mg, −0.4 kg;  xxxd99xxx  50 mg, −0.9 kg; placebo,
−0.7 kg; p = nr).

add-on therapy versus placebo
 xxxd99xxx  was more effective than placebo when added on
to pioglitazone ± metformin in patients with  xxxd797xxx  in the
harmony 1 study.18 after 52 weeks of therapy, the
change in a1c from baseline was −0.81% in patients taking
 xxxd99xxx  compared with −0.05% for placebo (p < 0.0001).
this effect was sustained during the 52-week study period.
weight increased slightly in patients taking  xxxd99xxx  and
was not significantly different when compared with placebo
(+0.28 vs +0.45 kg, p = ns).

add-on therapy versus active comparator
 xxxd99xxx  was more effective than placebo, sitagliptin,
and  xxxd2203xxx  when added on to metformin in patients
with  xxxd797xxx  in the harmony 3 study.14 change in a1c
from baseline was superior for  xxxd99xxx  compared with
placebo (treatment difference = −0.9%; p < 0.0001), sitagliptin (treatment difference = −0.4%; p = 0.0001), and
 xxxd2203xxx  (treatment difference = −0.3%; p = 0.0001).
this effect was durable throughout the 104-week study
period.  xxxd99xxx  also had superior effects on fpg levels
compared with placebo (−28 mg/dl, p < 0.0001), sitagliptin
(−16 mg/dl, p = 0.0002), and  xxxd2203xxx  (−10 mg/dl, p =
0.0133). weight loss was similar between  xxxd99xxx  and
sitagliptin, and placebo  xxxd99xxx  weight loss was superior
to  xxxd2203xxx  (treatment difference = −2.4 kg, p < 0.0001).

abstract only.

the harmony 7 study conducted by pratley et al17 is
the only head-to-head study comparing  xxxd99xxx  with
another glp-1 ra. the 32-week, noninferiority study
compared  xxxd99xxx  to  xxxd2495xxx  in patients with  xxxd797xxx 
already treated with metformin, pioglitazone, a sulfonylurea, or any combination of those agents. the primary end

point was change in a1c from baseline, with noninferiority
being achieved if the upper margin of the 95% confidence
interval did not exceed 0.3. change in a1c from baseline
was −0.78% in the  xxxd99xxx  group compared with −0.99%
in the  xxxd2495xxx  group, which failed to reach noninferiority
criteria (treatment difference = 0.21%; 95% ci = 0.08-0.34;

noninferiority p value = 0.0846). in addition, weight loss
was significantly greater with  xxxd2495xxx  compared with
 xxxd99xxx  (−2.19 vs −0.64 kg; 95% ci = 1.05-2.06; p <
0.0001).
in the harmony 5 study,  xxxd99xxx  did not meet the
noninferiority criteria versus pioglitazone when added on to
metformin and  xxxd2203xxx .19 change in a1c from baseline
was −0.55% for  xxxd99xxx  and −0.8% for pioglitazone
(treatment difference = +0.25%; 95% ci = 0.10-0.40).
 xxxd99xxx  did lead to modest weight loss, which was superior
to the weight gain seen with pioglitazone (−0.4 vs +4.4 kg,
p < 0.0001).
 xxxd99xxx  was compared with  xxxd2362xxx  in
patients not adequately controlled on metformin ± sulfonylurea in the harmony 4 study.16 change in a1c from
baseline was −0.67% in the  xxxd99xxx  group and −0.79%
in the  xxxd2362xxx  group (treatment difference = 0.11%;
95% ci = −0.04 to 0.27). the upper bound of the 95% ci
was less than 0.3 indicating that  xxxd99xxx  was noninferior
to  xxxd2362xxx . reductions in fpg were better in the
 xxxd2362xxx  group (−37.1 vs −15.7 mg/dl, p < 0.0001),
whereas changes in weight were better in the  xxxd99xxx 
group (−1.05 vs +1.56 kg, p < 0.0001).
 xxxd99xxx  was compared with insulin lispro in patients
not adequately controlled on basal insulin ± metformin ±
thiazolidinedione in the harmony 6 study.13 change in
a1c from baseline was −0.82% in the  xxxd99xxx  group and
−0.66% in the insulin lispro group (95% ci = −0.32 to
0.00), thus meeting the noninferiority criteria. reductions
in fpg were not significantly different between groups.
changes in weight were better in the  xxxd99xxx  group compared with insulin lispro (−0.73 vs +0.81 kg, p < 0.0001).

special populations
 xxxd99xxx  was compared with daily sitagliptin in patients
with  xxxd797xxx  and renal impairment (estimated glomerular filtration rate [egfr] ≥15 and <90 ml/min/1.73 m2) in the
harmony 8 study.15  xxxd99xxx  did not require any renal
dose adjustment (35% of patients on  xxxd99xxx  were uptitrated to the 50-mg weekly dose); the sitagliptin dose was
adjusted per prescribing recommendations. change in a1c
from baseline was significantly better in the  xxxd99xxx 
group compared with sitagliptin (−0.83% vs −0.52; p =
0.0003). this difference was consistent regardless of degree
of renal insufficiency.

treatment satisfaction
treatment satisfaction was evaluated in the harmony 6
and harmony 7 trials.20,21 both studies used the validated diabetes medication satisfaction questionnaire,
which measures overall satisfaction and satisfaction in 3
domains (treatment burden, efficacy, and unwanted
side effects), all scored from 0 to 100, with higher scores

correlating with higher satisfaction. in harmony 6, overall satisfaction scores increased in the  xxxd99xxx  group and
decreased in the insulin lispro group (+2.7 vs −1.7; p <
0.0001). differences between the 2 groups were favorable
toward  xxxd99xxx  in all 3 domains, albeit both groups had
reductions in satisfaction in the side effects domain compared with baseline. in harmony 7, there were no significant differences in treatment satisfaction between the
 xxxd99xxx  and  xxxd2495xxx  groups. overall treatment satisfaction increased in both the  xxxd99xxx  and  xxxd2495xxx 
groups, as did satisfaction in the treatment burden and efficacy domains. treatment satisfaction declined in the side
effects domain in both groups.

dosage and administration
recommendations
 xxxd99xxx  is administered once weekly at any time of the
day, without regard to meals. the drug should be injected
sc into the abdomen, thigh, or upper arm. the initial starting dose is 30 mg once weekly. if additional glycemic control is needed, the dose can be increased to 50 mg once
weekly. the fully published harmony studies uptitrated
the dose to 50 mg after at least 6 to 8 weeks of treatment if
glycemic targets were not being met.13,14.17 although the
prescribing information does not provide specific guidance
on dose escalation, it seems reasonable to consider increasing the dose after at least 6 weeks of treatment if the patient
is tolerating the drug without side effects and glycemic targets are not met. missed doses should be administered
within 3 days of missing the dose. no dose adjustment is
needed in patients with egfr ≥15 ml/min/1.73 m2. there
are no recommendations for use in patients with egfr <15
ml/min/1.73 m2. the medication comes as a lyophilized
powder in a single-dose injector pen device supplied with a
5-mm, 29-gauge needle and requires reconstitution prior to
administration.5 reconstitution requires twisting the cartridge, rocking the pen side-to-side, and waiting 15 to 30
minutes to ensure that the solution is mixed. the reconstituted solution is good for up to 8 hours but must be administered immediately after the pen needle is attached and
primed to avoid clogging the needle.5 unmixed or unused
pens can be stored in the refrigerator until the manufacturer’s expiration date or for up to 4 weeks at room temperature. if stored in the refrigerator, they should be transferred
to room temperature for 15 minutes before starting the

abstract only.

diarrhea (7.5%-14.9%), and injection site reactions (6.8%22%). as with the other glp-1 ra agents, the potentiation
of insulin and glucagon release are glucose dependent, so
the risk of hypoglycemia is low, except in instances where
the drug is added to other therapies likely to cause hypoglycemia, such as sulfonylureas or insulin. because of the
larger overall molecule size, it appears that the centrally
mediated side effects may be less with this medication, specifically the decreased gastric emptying (which may manifest as symptoms of bloating and/or nausea) and appetite
suppression.
a phase 2 study with 356 patients with  xxxd797xxx  comparing
varying doses and intervals of  xxxd99xxx  with exenatide
treatment or placebo showed the occurrence of nausea/
vomiting in 29% of those taking 30 mg of  xxxd99xxx 
weekly, compared with 46% in patients taking exenatide
twice daily.9 the higher doses of  xxxd99xxx  required to
extend the dosing to biweekly or monthly increased the
incidence of nausea substantially, with the 50-mg biweekly
dose associated with a 54.3% incidence and the 100-mg
monthly dose associated with a 55.9% incidence. with all
dosing intervals, the highest severity of nausea occurred
shortly after administration. the 30-mg once-weekly dose
had no reports of nausea and vomiting during the second
half of the trial (weeks 9 to 16 of the 16-week study).
the fully published phase 3 harmony trials and
pooled data from the prescribing information showed a high
rate of uris in both the active  xxxd99xxx  and placebo

groups (16.2% vs 13%).5,13,14,17 other adverse reactions
associated with  xxxd99xxx  were primarily gi side effects
and injection site reactions (table 3). in most cases, the gi
symptoms were mild to moderate in severity; pooled data
across the trials indicated that 7% of patients reported that
their gi symptoms were severe in nature, and 2% of patients
discontinued treatment as a result of severe gi side effects
in both the treatment and placebo groups.5 the incidence of
nausea and vomiting in harmony 1 was comparable
with that in placebo, with diarrhea rates being slightly
higher (11.3% for  xxxd99xxx  vs 8.6% for placebo).18
harmony 3 showed slightly higher rates of nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea in the  xxxd99xxx  treatment group compared with the sitagliptin and  xxxd2203xxx  group, suggesting
that the superior efficacy does come with a higher gi side
effect profile.14 harmony 4 compared  xxxd99xxx  with
 xxxd2362xxx , and predictably,  xxxd99xxx  showed a
higher gi side effect profile across 1 year of treatment,
whereas the risk of hypoglycemia was lower.16 harmony
5 showed that  xxxd99xxx  was associated with a higher gi
side effect profile compared with pioglitazone, with lower
hypoglycemia.19 harmony 7 demonstrated that while
 xxxd2495xxx  had better a1c reductions and better weight loss,
 xxxd99xxx  had a lower incidence of gi side effects.17
finally, harmony 8, performed in patients with renal
impairment, demonstrated that while the incidence of gi
side effects were overall low, they were still higher with
 xxxd99xxx  compared with sitagliptin.15

harmony 8 was designed to study patients with  xxxd797xxx 
who had some degree of renal impairment (egfr ≥15 and
<90 ml/min/1.73 m2) across 26 weeks, using either  xxxd99xxx  30 mg (titrated up to 50 mg if needed) or sitagliptin. these
data indicated that  xxxd99xxx  was well tolerated by this population, with no dosing adjustment needed. the package insert
for the drug currently recommends no dose adjustments in
patients with egfr between 15 and 89 ml/min/1.73 m2.
there are no trials currently evaluating the use of  xxxd99xxx  in pregnant women. animal models were restricted
by the formation of drug-clearing antibodies; however, they
did suggest some reproductive toxicity but not teratogenicity. it is recommended that women stop the medication at
least 1 month before planning a pregnancy, and the drug is
listed as a category c.5 because of the fact that  xxxd99xxx 
is albumin based, it is probable that it would be present in
breast milk. it is recommended that nursing mothers decide
whether to discontinue nursing or discontinue the drug.
pancreatitis continues to be an area under close observation with all incretin mimetics, and  xxxd99xxx  is no exception. across the 8 phase 3 clinical trials, there were a total of
6 cases determined to be “likely related to therapy” with
 xxxd99xxx  (6 of 2365 [0.3%]) compared with 2 cases in
comparator groups (2 of 2065 [0.1%]) and none in the placebo groups (0 of 468 [0%]).5 the fda required the inclusion of this risk in the risk evaluation and mitigation
strategy program with  xxxd99xxx , warning both providers
and patients of this potential adverse effect.5,22 similar to
 xxxd2495xxx  labeling, the fda required inclusion of a black
box warning in the  xxxd99xxx  prescribing information,
warning of potential thyroid medullary c-cell tumors, based
on rodent studies with other glp-1 ra agents. it is currently unknown whether  xxxd99xxx  poses this risk in
humans. carcinogenicity studies were not performed on the
drug because of the rapid development of drug-clearing
antibodies in the animals that were tested. the fda did
issue postmarketing requirements with  xxxd99xxx , including the maintenance of a medullary thyroid case registry for
at least 15 years to further evaluate this risk as well as a
study evaluating safety in pediatric patients and a long-term
cardiovascular outcomes trial to assess the risk of  xxxd99xxx  in patients with underlying cardiovascular disease. this
trial is scheduled to be completed in 2019. these requirements will add significant data to evaluate the safety of  xxxd99xxx  in the future.

formulary considerations
currently, there are no published studies analyzing the
cost-effectiveness of  xxxd99xxx  in clinical practice. in
addition, although it has been fda approved, it is not yet
available for use in the united states. therefore, the average wholesale price is not available. metformin remains
the first-line therapy for  xxxd797xxx , and  xxxd99xxx  is not

recommended as first-line therapy for  xxxd797xxx . for patients
who do not achieve glycemic control on metformin or who
cannot tolerate metformin, the american diabetes
association recommends an individualized approach to
selecting second-line agents.3 the glp-1 ra class is
appealing because of the good glucose-lowering effect, the
potential for weight loss, and the low risk of hypoglycemia.
however, the glp-1 ras have gi side effects that may
limit their use in some patients. they are also expensive
and must be given via sc injection, thus requiring additional supplies and patient education.
formulary considerations with  xxxd99xxx  require comparisons to be made within the glp-1 ra class. currently
available products within the class include exenatide twice
daily (byetta), exenatide once weekly ( xxxd2076xxx ), and  xxxd2495xxx  once daily ( xxxd2495xxx ). head-to-head trials of these
agents indicate that exenatide twice daily has less glucoselowering effect and higher rates of gi side effects compared
with  xxxd2495xxx  and exenatide once weekly, and  xxxd2495xxx  is
more effective at lowering glucose but has a higher gi side
effect profile than exenatide once weekly.23-26  xxxd99xxx 
did not demonstrate noninferiority to  xxxd2495xxx  and was less
effective at reducing weight but did result in less nausea and
vomiting than  xxxd2495xxx .17 to date,  xxxd99xxx  has not been
compared head to head with exenatide once weekly.
therefore,  xxxd99xxx  may be a suitable alternative to  xxxd2495xxx  in patients who are candidates for a glp-1 ra but
cannot tolerate the gi side effects of  xxxd2495xxx  or who prefer once-weekly dosing. finally, cost will be an important
formulary consideration for  xxxd99xxx  once the drug and
cost information is available in the united states.

conclusion
the approval of  xxxd99xxx  provides clinicians with another
glp-1 ra to consider in the treatment of  xxxd797xxx . clinical trials to date indicate that  xxxd99xxx  lowers a1c by 0.55% to
0.9%.  xxxd99xxx  was shown to be superior to placebo, sitagliptin, and  xxxd2203xxx  and noninferior to insulin lispro and
 xxxd2362xxx  but failed to meet noninferiority to  xxxd2495xxx  and pioglitazone. weight changes with  xxxd99xxx  in
clinical trials were modest, ranging from +0.28 to −1.21 kg.
the most common patient-reported side effects are uris,
diarrhea, nausea, and injection site reactions. compared
with another glp-1 ra— xxxd2495xxx — xxxd99xxx  seems to
be less effective at reducing a1c and weight but causes less
nausea and vomiting and is administered once weekly
instead of once daily. the long-term safety of  xxxd99xxx  is
currently being evaluated.
