abstract
fermented foods are frequently contaminated by histamine that is generated by
microorganisms with  xxxg1040xxx  activity. the ingestion of large
amounts of histamine can cause serious toxicological problems in humans. a
study of the effects of histamine, histidine, and growth phase on histamine
production by lactic acid bacteria isolated from wine is reported here. with
northern blots and specific activity analysis, we observed that histidine induces the
expression of the  xxxg1040xxx  gene (hdc) and that histamine causes a
decrease in the expression of this gene. the expression of hdc is also mediated by
the bacterial growth phase. histidine and histamine do not affect histidine
decarboxylase activity, whereas pyridoxal 5 0 -phosphate does. data on histamineproducing lactic acid bacteria isolated from wine should contribute to the
prevention of histamine formation during winemaking and storage.

introduction
biogenic amines are nitrogenous compounds that can cause
food poisoning. they may induce headaches, respiratory
distress, heart palpitations, hyper- or hypotension, and
several allergic disorders (silla-santos, 1996). the formation
of biogenic amines in food and beverages depends on the
quantities of free amino acids and the presence of microorganisms with decarboxylase activities. biogenic amines are
frequently found in wines and other fermented foods.
histamine is the most important amine in food-borne
intoxicants, because it has the greatest biological activity
(cabanis, 1985). its accumulation in food is the result of
bacterial  xxxg1040xxx  (hdc; e.c. 4.1.1.22) activity (halàsz et al., 1994).
the histamine in wine is of particular interest because it
has been reported that the presence of alcohol and other
amines promotes its effects by inhibiting the human detoxification systems (chu & bejdanes, 1981). many studies of
histamine in wines are reported each year.
yeast, acetic acid bacteria, and lactic acid bacteria (lab)
are the microorganisms present in wine and are possible

histamine producers, although lab are reported to be the
principal bacteria responsible for histamine production in
wine (le jeune et al., 1995; lonvaud-funel, 2001; landete
et al., 2005a). landete et al. (2005a) have demonstrated that,
of the lab present in wine, lactobacillus hilgardii and
pediococcus parvulus are the histamine producers principally
responsible for the high histamine concentrations in wine.
others species, such as oenococcus oeni, also produce
histamine. although the proportion of o. oeni histamine
producers is very high, this species produces histamine at
low levels.
the presence of these lab histamine producers in
histamine-containing wines is consistent with the results of
other studies (le jeune et al., 1995; guerrini et al., 2002) and
with reports of higher histamine levels after malolactic
fermentation (castino, 1975; aerny, 1985; cilliers & van
wyk, 1985).
the goal of this study was to examine the expression of
the hdc gene and hdc activity in relation to the bacterial
growth phase and the presence of histidine and histamine.
to achieve this, we used northern blotting and specific
activity experiments. the microorganisms investigated were

p. parvulus, l. hilgardii, and o. oeni. we also report the
effects on hdc activity and hdc expression of pyridoxal 5 0 phosphate.

material and methods
microorganisms and culture conditions
lactobacillus hilgardii 464, p. parvulus  xxxg190xxx , and o. oeni
4042 strains were isolated from wine in this laboratory, and
were maintained in 20% (v/v) glycerol frozen at  20 1c, or
freeze dried. lactobacillus and pediococcus were grown
routinely on mrs medium (scharlau chemie s.a., barcelona, spain) and oenococcus in medium for leuconostoc oenos
(mlo; caspritz & radler, 1983). they were maintained on
mrs or mlo plates, respectively, at 4 1c until needed.
microorganisms were incubated in h-ram (h-mdbmod
medium (landete et al., 2004) at ph 5.0 containing 1 g l1
histidine) for the studies of hdc regulation and hdc activity.
these strains were selected for their capacity to produce
histamine. we also confirmed the presence of the hdc gene in
these strains by pcr (landete et al., 2005a).

influence of growth phase on hdc expression
lactobacillus hilgardii 464 was inoculated in h-ram, and its
growth was recorded by periodic sampling. optical densities
of the samples were measured at 600 nm. samples (125 ml)
were taken at different times (3, 6, 12, 24, 32, 48, 60, and 72 h
after inoculation) to analyse the specific activity of hdc in
cell-free extracts and to quantify hdc mrnas by northern
blotting.
analysis of specific activity
cell-free extracts were prepared from samples at different
growth phases (3, 6, 12, 24, 32, 48, 60, and 72 h after
inoculation), according to the method of maicas et al.
(2002) by breaking the cells with glass beads. the supernatant was collected in a precooled eppendorf tube and
stored at  20 1c for further analyses. micro bca protein
assay reagent (pierce, rockford, il) was used to measure
the protein concentration in the cell-free extracts, according
to the manufacturer’s instructions, using bovine serum
albumin as the standard. then, 1 mg of protein from the
cell-free extracts was incubated in ammonium acetate buffer
(0.5 mol l1, ph 4.8). the reaction mixture used to determine histamine formation, in a final volume of 3 ml,
contained histidine (2 g l1) in the same acetate buffer. the
experiments were conducted at 37 1c for 10 min. the
enzyme was totally inactivated by incubation at 110 1c for
3 min. histamine production was then measured by the
enzymatic method of landete et al. (2004). one enzyme
unit (u) was defined as the amount of enzyme that released
fems microbiol lett 260 (2006) 84–90

1 mmol of histamine per minute under the given assay
conditions. specific activity was expressed as enzyme units
per milligram of protein.
analysis of mrnas by northern blotting
total rna was isolated during different growth phases from
l. hilgardii 464 cells grown in h-ram using the high pure
rna isolation kit (roche diagnostics, san cugat del vallés,
barcelona, spain) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. rna was transferred onto hybond-n1 membrane
(amersham biotech, uppsala, sweden) and hybridized as
described by sambrook et al. (1989). labelled single-stranded
probes were prepared as follows. first, a dna fragment was
amplified by pcr using the chromosomal dna of l. hilgardii
and the primer set jv16hc and jv17hc (landete et al.,
2005a) labelled with digoxigenin-11-deoxyuridine triphosphate (dutp) using the dig dna labeling kit (roche
diagnostics). the amplification conditions for the jv16hc/
jv17hc couple were denaturation at 95 1c for 5 min,
followed by 35 cycles of denaturation at 94 1c for 1 min,
annealing at 39.6 1c for 1 min, and extension at 72 1c for
1 min. products were detected by luminescence with an antidigoxigenin antibody and cdp-star (roche diagnostics).

influence of histidine on hdc expression
to assay the effects of histidine on hdc expression, we used
the minimal medium described by neidhardt et al. (1974)
supplemented with histidine at concentrations ranging from
0 g l1 to 2 g l1. microorganisms [0.1 ml (od600 nm =
0.50) of lactobacillus, pediococcus, and oenococcus] were
inoculated into 10 ml of this medium. cell-free extracts
were made from samples of these cultures to analyse the
specific activity of hdc with the enzymatic method (landete et al., 2004). northern blot experiments were performed
as described above.

effects of histamine and pyridoxal 5 0 -phosphate
on hdc expression
to study the effects of histamine and pyridoxal 5 0 -phosphate
on hdc expression in the three microorganisms described
above, experiments were conducted as described for the
analysis of histidine except that the medium used was hram supplemented with histamine at concentrations ranging from 0 to 2 g l1 or with pyridoxal 5 0 -phosphate at
concentrations ranging from 0 to 1 g l1.

reproducibility
to validate the method, the minitab student test was used.
three replicate determinations were made. the relative
standard deviations for amine concentrations were  5%.

results
the influence of the growth phase was analysed in l.
hilgardii 464. the effects of histidine, histamine, and pyridoxal 5 0 -phosphate on histamine production were evaluated for three different lab: l. hilgardii 464, p. parvulus
 xxxg190xxx , and o. oeni 4042. the capacity of each strain to
produce histamine differed, although the effects of histidine,
histamine, and pyridoxal 5 0 -phosphate on histamine production were similar.
landete et al. (2005a) have shown that the specific hdc
activity is higher in l. hilgardii 464 and p. parvulus  xxxg190xxx 
than in o. oeni 4042.

effects of the growth phase of lab on histamine
production
the specific hdc activity was determined during different
growth phases (fig. 1). it appeared during the early growth
phase, with peaks in specific hdc activity at 24, 32, and 48 h
after inoculation, which corresponded to the exponential
growth phase. the specific activity at 3 h after inoculation
was higher than that 6 h after inoculation. part of the
specific activity measured at 3 h was residual specific activity
from mrs medium, where the strains were grown routinely.
at 72 h, in the stationary growth phase, a significant
decrease in specific hdc activity was observed.
we observed that the decrease in the hdc activity is
rapid, and a large proportion of hdc activity is eliminated
in 12 h (data not shown).
to confirm that the growth phase mediates the regulation
of hdc expression, we performed northern blot experiments
at different growth phases. total rna samples were prepared from cultures of l. hilgardii at 3, 6, 12, 24, 32, 48, 60,
and 72 h after inoculation. equivalent amounts of rna

microorganisms grown in h-ram were added to 2.8 ml of

the effects of pyridoxal 5 0 -phopsphate, the reaction mixture
contained 2 g l1 histidine in the same buffer and pyridoxal
5 0 -phosphate at concentrations ranging from 0 to 1 g l1. to
study the effects of histidine or histamine, concentrations
ranging from 0to 2 g l1 of histidine or histamine were used,
respectively. the experiments were conducted at 37 1c for
10 min, and the enzyme was then totally inactivated by
incubation at 110 1c for 3 min. histamine production was
then measured by the enzymatic method of landete et al.

from each sample were transferred to a nylon membrane
and hybridized with a labelled hdc probe. maximal gene
expression occurred during the exponential growth phase
(24, 32 and 48 h after inoculation), it is indicated by peaks in
hdc rna concentration on northern blot analysis (fig. 2).
thus, the results observed for specific activity were confirmed by northern blotting, demonstrating that hdc expression is influenced by the bacterial growth phase.
moreover, hdc expression was highest at 6 h that at 3 h after
inoculation in the northern blot experiments.
the northern blot experiments demonstrated that the
hdc expression is very low at 72 h.

effects of histidine and histamine on hdc
expression
we used minimal medium to grow the lab strains to
preclude the inclusion of histidine. the specific hdc
activity was between 15% and 18% in minimal medium
without histidine. when histidine was added, an increase in
the percentage of specific activity was observed (fig. 3a).
the maximum percentage (100%) of specific hdc activity
was observed when 1 or 2 g l1 histidine was added. figure
3(a) shows that in the presence of 1 g l1 histidine, an
increase of between five- and sixfold occurred in the specific
activity of hdc.
when we studied the influence of the histidine on hdc
activity, we observed as the histidine had no effect on hdc
activity at histidine concentrations higher than 1 g l1, but
histidine concentrations below 1 g l1 produced a decrease
in histamine production (data not shown).
we used northern blotting to demonstrate that the
presence of histidine in the medium induced an increase in
the expression of hdc. at a concentration of 2 g l1 histidine,
the expression of hdc rna was high, whereas the expression
of hdc rna was very low without histidine (fig. 4).

not increase hdc activity.

discussion
in previous works, it has been important to quantify the
histamine concentration in wine because the presence of this
amine can cause toxicological disorders (lehtonen, 1996;
glória et al., 1998; vázquez-lasa et al., 1998; mafra et al.,
1999; landete et al., 2005b). in addition to quantifying this
amine, it is also important to know the capacity of bacteria
to produce amines involved in fermented foods in order to
establish the potential risk of histamine generation (coton
et al., 1998; guerrini et al., 2002; moreno-arribas et al.,
2003; landete et al., 2005a). in this study, we show that
histamine production is regulated by the presence of histidine and histamine and by the bacterial growth phase.
moreover, the presence of pyridoxal 5 0 -phosphate affects
histamine production. lactobacillus hilgardii, p. parvulus,
and o. oeni were the microorganisms evaluated because they
are the principal histamine-producing microorganisms in
wine (landete et al., 2005a).
the growth phase influences the expression of the hdc
gene. we observed that its expression is highest in the
exponential growth phase because histidine decarboxylation
generates metabolic energy (molenaar et al., 1993), and
maximum energy is consumed during growth and the
period of greatest cell division (zhang & lovitt, 2006). a
decrease in hdc expression was observed during the stationary growth phase, during which growth and cell division are
reduced. pessione et al. (2005) also observed that hdc
biosynthesis is closely dependent on the presence of high
concentrations of free amino acids in the growth medium
and is modulated by the growth phase. however, they
c 2006 federation of european microbiological societies
journal compilation 
published by blackwell publishing ltd. no claim to original spanish government works

analysed the presence of hdc protein, whereas we analysed
the specific activity of hdc and the expression of hdc rna.
they found that maximum hdc production occurred
during the stationary phase. however, they cultured their
bacteria on mrs medium, the glucose and fructose constituents of which decrease hdc expression (data not shown).
the glucose and fructose are consumed by the cells and
during the stationary phase their concentrations are very
low. the experiments performed in our study involved
bacteria cultured in h-ram, which contains no glucose or
fructose.
histidine is the substrate of hdc, and we observed the
induction of hdc expression by histidine, although a basal
level of hdc expression occurs without histidine. the presence of histidine in wine should have double effect on
histamine production because it is both the substrate of
hdc and it induces the expression of hdc. rollan et al.
(1995) found that hdc displays a high level of cooperativity, suggesting that low substrate affinity and an increase in
substrate concentration favour its binding. the decrease
observed in histamine production is probably attributable
to a histidine concentration lower than 1 g l1. any increase
in the histidine concentration produced by the lysis of yeasts
and their maceration must be controlled. on the other
hand, the presence of histamine represses hdc expression.
the induction of a gene by the substrate of its enzyme and
its repression by the product of this enzyme (end-product
inhibition) is very common in nature. rollan et al. (1995)
found that the inhibition of hdc activity by histamine, the
final product of the reaction, in a cell suspension was higher
(69%) than that measured in a cell-free extract (48%).
histamine acted as a competitive inhibitor and the inhibition constant (ki) was 50 mmol l1. in this paper, we
showed the inhibition of hdc expression by histamine.
studies of hdc have shown significant regulation of the
expression of this gene. inhibition of hdc expression by
malic acid,  xxxd1710xxx , glucose, and fructose has been
observed in our laboratory (unpublished data). in this
paper, we demonstrate a novel inhibitor of hdc expression
(histamine) and an inducer of hdc expression (histidine).
histidine decarboxylases from animals and gram-negative bacteria are monomeric pyridoxal-5 0 -phosphate-dependent enzymes (tanase et al., 1985), whereas those from
gram-positive bacteria are heteromeric enzymes. konagaya
et al. (2002) showed that this enzyme contains an essential
 xxxd2613xxx  but not pyridoxal 5 0 -phosphate. however,
this study has demonstrated that pyridoxal 5 0 -phosphate is a
decarboxylase cofactor, enhancing the enzyme’s amino acid
decarboxylase activity, as previously shown by recsei et al.
(1983). we have also demonstrated that this enzyme has
activity in the absence of pyridoxal 5 0 -phosphate, although
this activity is minor. therefore, hdc activity is also subject
to regulation.
fems microbiol lett 260 (2006) 84–90

regulation of the  xxxg1040xxx  gene

although the specific activities of hdc differed in the
three strains studied (l. hilgardii 464, p. parvulus  xxxg190xxx ,
and o. oeni 4042), a similar proportional response was
induced with histidine, histamine, and pyridoxal 5 0 -phosphate, and the level of regulation (expression and activity)
was similar in each of them. this could mean that a general
mechanism underlies the synthesis and activity of hdc in
these organisms.
these results should contribute to our understanding of
histamine production by lab in wine, and could lead to
future applications in the prevention of excessive amounts
of histamine forming during vinification and storage.
