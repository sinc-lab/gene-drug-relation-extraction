alkaloidinhibition
of  xxxg2417xxx 
(vip)-stimulated cyclicamp production in gh4zr7
cells, stablytransfectedwitha
rat d2 dopamine
receptor, were evaluated. ergovaline inhibition of the
binding of the d2-specific radioligand, l3h1ym09151-2, exhibited a k1 (inhibition constant) of 6.9 f
2.6 nm, whereas dopamine was much less potent(370
k 160 nm). ergotalkaloids
were also effective in
inhibiting vip-stimulated  xxxd1773xxx  production, with
ec50 values for ergovaline,  xxxd2021xxx , cr-ergocrypkeywords:

tine, ergotamine, and dopamine of 8 f 2,47 f 2, 28 _+ 2,
2 k 1, and 8 +_ 1 nm, respectively. inhibition of cyclic
amp production by ergovaline was blockedby the
dopamine receptorantagonist,
( -)-sulpiride(ic50,
ergot
300 f 150 nm). ourresultsindicatethat
compounds, especially ergovaline, bind to d2 dopamine receptors and elicit second messenger responses
similar to that of dopamine. these findings suggest
that some of the deleterious effects of consumption of
endophyte-infected tall fescue, which contains several
ergot alkaloids including ergovaline, may be due to d2
dopamine receptor activation.

introduction
ergopeptide alkaloids (yates et al.,1985; yates and
powell, 1988) have been isolated from tall fescue
infected withthe
endophytic fungus acremonium
coenophialum (morgan-jonesandgams,1982).ergopeptide alkaloids have been suggested as perhaps
the most responsible compounds involved inthe
toxicity of endophyte-infected tall fescue to cattle
(lyons et al., 1986). among the natural ergopeptide
alkaloids found in endophyte-infected tall fescue,
ergovaline is the most abundant, accounting for 84 to
97% of the total ergopeptide alkaloid fraction (yates
et al., 1985).
the ergoline ring structure,found in all ergopeptide
alkaloids and most otherergot
compounds, shares

structural
similarities
with
the
monoamine neurotransmitters
epinephrine,
norepinephrine, dopamine, and serotonin (berde,1980). ligand binding
experiments have demonstrated the high affinity that
various ergot alkaloids have
for d2 dopamine receptors(badiaet
al., 1988; okumuraet
al., 1988;
carginale et al., 1992), which correlates with inhibition of prolactinrelease inculturedpituitary
cells
(caron etal., 1978) and inhibitionof adenylyl cyclase
activity in
rat
striatal
and
nucleus accumbens
homogenates (spano
and
trabucchi, 1978). the
effects of ergovaline on monoamine receptor binding or
second messenger generation have not been reported.
the objectives of thisstudy were todetermine
whether ergovaline binds to d2 dopamine receptors
and whether ergopeptide alkaloids affect second messengergeneration. to addressthisissue,
we used
bindingwith a d2 dopamine receptor-specific radioligand and inhibition of  xxxg2417xxx 
(vip)-stimulated cyclicamp production in gh4zr7
cells stablytransfectedwith
the rat d2 dopamine
receptor (shortform).

materials andmethods
the gh4zr7 cells were obtained from david

on d2 dopamine receptor

ergovaline was isolated by a. s. moubarak, university of arkansas, fayetteville (95% purity, moubarak
et al., 1993). the vip was purchased
from bachem
(torrence,ca).seraandculturemedia
were obtained from gibco (grand island, ny). the following compounds were purchased from sigma chemical
(st. louis, mo): dopamine, ( -)-sulpiride,  xxxd2021xxx ,
a-ergocryptine, and  xxxd2022xxx . the r3h1ym09151-2 (emonapride) and [3h]adenine were obtained
from dupontnen(boston,ma).
cell culture. the gh4zr7 cells were grown in
ham's f-l0 medium,supplementedwith10%fetal
bovine serum, at 37°c in 5% c02. growth medium
waschanged
12 t o 24 h before experimentation.
ligand binding. cell membranes were prepared by
first replacing growth medium with ice-cold hypotonic
buffer (1 mm hepes, ph7.4, 2 mm edta). after
swelling for 10 to 15 min, the lysed cells were scraped
from the place and centrifuged (24,000 x g , 20 min)
and resuspended (tekmar tissumizer;
maximum
speed;10
s ) in 20 volumes of deionized water.
aliquots of 20 p l were removed for protein determinations
(lowry
et al., 1951) using bovine serum
albumin as the standard.
binding experiments( n = 3 )
were performed at a finaltissuedilution
of 250
volumes in 50 mm tris (ph 7.4) containing (mm)
edta ( l . o ) , cac12 (1.51, mgc12 (4.0), kc1 (5.01,
and nacl ( 120). saturation experiments (turner et
al.,1985; bylund and yamamura, 1990) were done
with various concentrations (.02 to 6 m of the d2
selective antagonist
radioligand,
[3hlym-09151-2
(specificactivity = 70 to 87 cummol; terai et al.,
1989). resuspended cell membranes(970@l)and
[3h]ym-09151-2 (20 pl) were incubated for 1 h at
room temperature. nonspecific bindingwasdetermined by the inclusion of 10 p m (-)-sulpiride and
constituted less than 15% of total binding at concentrations of radioligand near the equilibrium dissociation constant ( k d ) value. the incubation was terminated by filtration through whatman gfa3 glass-fiber
filters (whatman, clifton, n j ) , followedby rinsing
the filters with 10 ml of ice-cold 50 mm  xxxd3449xxx 
(ph 8.0) and transferring them to vials containing 10
ml of scintillation cocktail. radioactivity was deterat an
mined by liquid
scintillation
spectrometry
efficiency of 41% (external, quantified r3h1 standard).

acid wasadded.the
[3h)cyclicamp and [3h]atp
were separated by dowedaluminachromatography
(minnemanet al., 1979)and quantified by liquid
scintillation spectrometry. values were calculated as
percentage of conversion: [3h]cyclicamp/[3h]cyclic
amp + r3h1atp.

results and discussion
saturation radioligand binding analysis with membranes from gh4zr7 cells stably transfected (albert
et al., 1990) with a rat d2 dopamine receptor cdna
(bunzowet al., 1988) revealed a kd for r3h1ym09151-2 of 46 f 1 pm (mean and range, n = 2 ) and a
receptordensity
( bmm) of 700 f 50 fmovmg
of
membrane protein. as shown in figure 1, dopamine
inhibited radioligand binding with low affhity (k1 =
370 f 160 m. thus,theresults
from ourinitial
bindingexperiments were in reasonableagreement
with the results reported previously in this heterologous expression system (albert et al., 1990). as also
shown in figure 1, ergovaline inhibited the binding of
[3hlym-09151-2 withsubstantiallyhigheraffinity
than dopamine, exhibiting a k1 value of 6.9 f 2.6 n m .

dopamine receptor, we compared their effects on vipstimulated  xxxd1773xxx  production with that of dopamine. comparative research of endophyte-infected tall
fescue’s ergot alkaloids often includes several natural
ergot compgunds because of their commercial availability and structural similarities (porter et al., 1985;
jackson et al., 1989; solomons et al., 1989). ergotamine, an ergopeptide alkaloid produced by clauiceps,
but not by acremonium, is occasionally found in
samples of tall fescue. ergotamine is most common in
small grains such as rye and content seems to vary
yearly, dependent on growing season climatic conditions.
as shown in figure 2, ergovaline,  xxxd2021xxx , aergocryptine, and ergotamine were all potent inhibitors of vip-stimulated cyclic
amp
production as
assessed in intact gh4zr7 cells with the c3h1adenine

nm) were potent to the same order of magnitude as
dopamine ( 8 k 2 m.thus, all four ergot compounds
are good agonists at thed2 dopamine receptor, in this

compared with

thesuggestion that the inhibitory effects of the
ergot compounds on  xxxd1773xxx  prodyction are mediated by d2 dopamine receptors is strongly supported
by blockade of the inhibition (figure 3 ) by the d2
dopamine receptorantagonist ( -)-sulpiride(inhibitory concentration - ic50 = 300 k 150 n m , n = 3 1 over
an appropriate concentration range (. 1 nm to 10 clm>.

mechanism for this observation is not postulated.
the rat has previously been establishedasan
appropriate animal model (porter et al., 1985; jackson et al., 1989; larson, 1993) andwe have suggested
long-term regulation of d 2 dopamine receptor mrna
by rats consuming adiet of seeds from endophyteinfected tall fescue (325 ppb of ergovaline, larson et
al., 1994). the ability of ergovaline t o inhibit binding
and
to inhibit vipof a d2-specific radioligand
stimulated  xxxd1773xxx  production would additionally
suggest the potential of short-term regulation of the
d 2 dopamine receptor by this ergopeptide alkaloid.
the d 2 dopamine receptor is known to be involved in
the regulation of body temperature in mice (nunes et
al., 1991) and hasbeen implicated in the reduction of
prolactin secretion noted in rats (porter et al., 1985;
larson, 19931, sheep (elsasser and bolt, 19871, and
cattle(rhodeset
al., 1991) consuming endophyteinfected tall fescue diets.

implications
ergovaline and other ergopeptide alkaloids found in
endophyte-infected tall fescue functionally affect d 2
dopamine receptors in a manner
similar
to the
endogenous ligand dopamine. consumption of endophyte-infected tall fescue mayincreasecirculating
