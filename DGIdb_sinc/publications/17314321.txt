activation of single nicotinic receptor channels from caenorhabditis elegans muscle.  nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nachrs) are pentameric neurotransmitter-gated ion channels that mediate synaptic transmission throughout the nervous system in vertebrates and invertebrates. caenorhabditis elegans is a nonmammalian model for the study of the nervous system and a model of parasitic nematodes. nematode muscle nachrs are of considerable interest because they are targets for anthelmintic drugs. we show single-channel activity of c. elegans muscle nachrs for the first time. our results reveal that in the l1 larval stage acetylcholine (ach) activates mainly a levamisole-sensitive nachr (l-achr). a single population of 39 ps channels, which are 5-fold more sensitive to levamisole than ach, is detected. in contrast to mammalian nachrs, open durations are longer for levamisole than for ach. studies in mutant strains reveal that unc-38, unc-63, and unc-29 subunits are assembled into a single l-achr in the l1 stage and that these subunits are irreplaceable, suggesting that they are vital for receptor function throughout development. recordings from a strain mutated in the lev-1 subunit show a main population of channels with lower conductance (26 ps), prolonged open durations, and reduced sensitivity to levamisole. thus, although lev-1 is preferentially incorporated into native l-achrs, receptors lacking this subunit can still function. no single-channel activity from levamisole-insensitive nachrs is detected. thus, during neuromuscular transmission in c. elegans, the majority of ach-activated current flows through l-achrs. this study contributes to the understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying functional diversity of the nachr family and offers an excellent strategy to test novel antiparasitic drugs.
