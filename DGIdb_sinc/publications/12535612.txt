abstract
the interactions between  xxxg913xxx  (gad) and its cofactor  xxxd3047xxx  (plp) play a key role in the regulation of
gad activity. the enzyme has two isoforms,  xxxg850xxx  and  xxxg849xxx . a comparison of binding constants, rate constants, and kinetic profiles for
the formation of holoenzyme (hologad65 and hologad67) revealed that the two isoforms interact distinctively with the cofactor.  xxxg849xxx 
exhibits a higher binding constant for plp binding, making it more difficult to dissociate plp from hologad67 than hologad65.
meanwhile, plp binding occurs at a much slower rate for  xxxg849xxx  than  xxxg850xxx , as evidenced by lower rate constants and a slower initial rate
of the holoenzyme formation. job’s plots revealed a stoichiometry of 1:1 for plp binding to  xxxg850xxx  before and after the saturation level of
plp, while 1:2 for plp binding to  xxxg849xxx  prior to the saturation of plp and 1:1 at the saturation level of plp. these results suggested that
the two binding sites of  xxxg850xxx  exhibit similar affinities for plp. in contrast, one binding site of  xxxg849xxx  exhibits a significantly higher
affinity for plp than the other binding site. based on these findings, it was proposed that a slower plp binding to  xxxg849xxx  than  xxxg850xxx  and a
less ease to dissociate plp from hologad67 than hologad65 are important underlying factors. this attributes to  xxxg849xxx  being more highly
saturated by plp and  xxxg850xxx  being less saturated by plp. a larger conformation change constant for  xxxg849xxx  than  xxxg850xxx  supported a
significant conformational change induced by the initial plp binding to  xxxg849xxx , which affects the other binding site affinity of  xxxg849xxx . the
present studies provided valuable insights into distinctive properties between the two isoforms of gad.

1. introduction
brain  xxxg913xxx  (gad) catalyzes the synthesis of the inhibitory transmitter g- xxxd2177xxx 
(gaba). gad requires the cofactor  xxxd3047xxx 
(plp) for its activity. elucidation of gad –cofactor interactions is essential to understanding the regulation of gad.
the brain contains two isoforms of gad with molecular
masses of 65 and 67 kda, named  xxxg850xxx  and  xxxg849xxx  [1,2].
rat  xxxg850xxx  and  xxxg849xxx  have an overall 65% of identity. in
the c terminus, the two isoforms have 73% identity and are
highly conserved. in the n terminus,  xxxg850xxx  and  xxxg849xxx 
have only 23% identity.

the two isoforms of gad are derived from two different
genes and differ in amino acid sequence and in cellular and
subcellular location [1,2].  xxxg850xxx  is present primarily in
axon terminals, and is much less saturated by the cofactor
[3,4]. in contrast,  xxxg849xxx  is widely distributed throughout
neurons, and is highly saturated by the cofactor in brain
extracts. an understanding of the difference in the saturation
of plp in  xxxg850xxx  and  xxxg849xxx  and its implication in the
regulation of gad activity requires a comparative elucidation of the cofactor interactions with  xxxg850xxx  and  xxxg849xxx .
at the present time, no three-dimensional x-ray structure is
available for brain gad.
the formation of holoenzyme of gad (hologad)
involves two steps [5 – 7]: an initial association of the
cofactor with the apoenzyme (apogad) to form an intermediate apogad –plp complex, followed by a complex
conformational change [5– 7]. apogad65 –cofactor inter-

mediate complex formation is a fast reaction, with a
pseudo-first order rate constant of 0.93 s 1, as determined
when the concentration of cofactor is much larger than that
of apogad65 [7]. in contrast, the complex conformational
change is a slow reaction, with a rate constant of
1.0  10 2 s 1, suggesting that the rate of intermediate
complex formation plays an essential role in determining
the quantity of hologad65 formed. atp was found to
reduce the rate of complex formation to one third of its
original value [7], which could be the underlying reason
for atp’s ability to function as an important factor in
regulating  xxxg850xxx .
an understanding of hologad formation at the molecular level requires understanding the active site and the
conformational change that the protein undergoes. at the
active site of gad, the cofactor plp is exposed to solvent
and is present in a positively charged microenvironment
[8], making plp accessible for interactions with anions.
tryptophan residues in  xxxg850xxx  are partially exposed to the
solvent. the exposed trp residues are located primarily
outside of the active site, as suggested by the differences in
the exposure of trp residues and the cofactor to charged
quenchers such as i and cs+. cofactor binding changes
the microenvironment of trp residues, implying a significant change in enzyme conformation. this conformational
change is also evidenced by increases in the a-helical
content and the enthalpy and temperature of thermal
unfolding of the enzyme [9,10].
despite the importance of understanding the differences
in plp interacting with  xxxg850xxx  and  xxxg849xxx  and their level
of saturation by plp, a comparative elucidation of the
cofactor interactions with the two isoforms has not been
investigated. the present work intended to carry out such an
investigation by comparing binding constants, rate constants, and subunit bindings for  xxxg850xxx  and  xxxg849xxx . by
delineating key underlying factors that attribute to their
interactions, the results provided a better understanding of
distinctive properties between these two isoforms.

2. materials and methods
2.1. preparation and purification of gad
the preparation and purification of recombinant rat brain
 xxxg850xxx  have previously been described [7 –10]. briefly,
sf9 cells were grown in tnm-fh medium containing 10%
fetal bovine serum, and were infected with a recombinant
baculovirus containing the entire rat  xxxg850xxx  coding region
at a multiplicity of infection of 2. the harvested cells were
homogenized and centrifuged. the supernatant was passed
through q-sepharose and hydroxylapatite chromatography
columns, eluted with a 10– 250 mm sodium phosphate
gradient, ph 7.0, containing 1 mm 2-aminoethylisothiouronium bromide (aet) [11], and collected in 20 am plp.
similar procedures were followed to prepare and purify

recombinant rat brain  xxxg849xxx , except that sf9 cells were
infected with a recombinant baculovirus containing the
entire rat  xxxg849xxx  coding region at a multiplicity of infection of 1.
purified recombinant brain  xxxg850xxx  and  xxxg849xxx  were
identical to unmodified rat brain gad, based on sds
polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, dna sequence composition, amino-acid sequencing, and enzyme assay. electrophoresis gel determinations revealed a single band for
purified  xxxg850xxx  or  xxxg849xxx . the estimated purity was
97– 98% based on immunoblots. the protein concentration
was determined by the coomassie blue method using bsa
as the standard and was confirmed by absorbance measurements.
apogad65 or apogad67 was prepared by adding
aspartate (final concentration 5 mm) to hologad65 or
hologad67, incubating at 4 jc, and dialyzing against the
same buffer to remove plp and aspartate.
2.2. chemicals
plp, aet, and  xxxd233xxx  (monosodium salt) were
purchased from sigma chemical co. sodium phosphates
(monobasic and dibasic) were from j.t. baker chemical co.
these chemicals were reagent-grade and were used without
further purification. all other reagents were also from
commercial sources.
2.3. ultraviolet and visible spectra of gad
a beckman du640 uv/visible spectrophotometer was
employed to characterize hologad and to ensure that plp
was completely removed in apogad [7 –10]. the absorbance at 280 nm was also used to determine gad concentration.
2.4. fluorescence quenching measurements
plp binding to apogad65 or apogad67 forms hologad65 or hologad67. the overall binding constant was
determined by fluorescence quenching experiments using a
perkin-elmer ls-50b luminescence spectrometer equipped
with fluorescence data-manager software for data presentation and analysis [12]. two milliliters of apogad65 or
apogad67 solution (0.07 – 0.10 mg/ml) was placed in a 1cm path length cuvette. the excitation wavelength was 295
nm and the emission wavelength was 352 nm. in the
absence of plp, the initial fluorescence emission intensity
was recorded as fo. readings of emission intensity ( f) were
taken after each incremental addition of 5 al of 30 am plp,
giving a final plp concentration ranging from 0 to 1.4 am.
after a 90-s resolving period at 20 jc, duplicate readings
were taken to ensure homogeneity and reproducibility. the
value of [( fo  f)/fo]  100 was then determined for each
additional 5 al of plp. the dilution effect was measured in a
similar experiment with the addition of buffer. the corrected

c.-h. chen et al. / biochimica et biophysica acta 1645 (2003) 63–71

values of [( fo  f)/fo]  100 were obtained after considering the small dilution effect. binding constant (kb) for plp
binding to gad was determined by best-fitting of
[( fo  f)/fo]  100 versus [plp] using a sigma plot program for windows (spss) [13].
2.5. determinations of free energy changes
free energy changes, dgb, dgcpx, and dgcom, for binding of plp to gad, intermediate complex formation, and
conformational change, were calculated from the obtained
corresponding binding constant (kb), intermediate complex
formation constant (kcpx), and conformational change constant (kcom), based on the relationships, dgb =  rt  lnkb,
dgcpx =  rt  lnkcpx, and dgcom =  rt  lnkcom, respectively, where r is the gas constant and t is the temperature in jk.
2.6. stopped-flow fluorescence spectroscopy
kinetics of plp binding to apogad67 was determined
by stopped-flow fluorescence spectroscopy as previously
described [7], using an olis stopped-flow instrument. this
instrument was equipped with a 450-w xenon arc lamp as
the excitation source, a single-grating monochromator as the
excitation light wavelength selector, and a photomultiplier
tube with a 320-nm cutoff filter placed at 90j to the
excitation source to collect fluorescence. the sample chamber was controlled  xxxd1891xxx  jc. excitation wavelength was 280
nm. scanning times ranging from 20 to 65 s were used
mainly to detect the initial cofactor– apogad67 complex
formation in the binding reaction.

65

2.7. manual mixing fluorescence spectroscopy
mixing of plp with apogad67 was also performed by
fluorescence in a conventional spectrophotometer to investigate the conformational change following the formation of
cofactor– apogad67 complex [7]. excitation wavelength
was 280 nm and emission wavelength was 333 nm. changes
in trp fluorescence emission intensity were monitored. the
fluorescence intensity – time response curve obtained upon
mixing of plp with apogad was then fitted to an exponential function by least-square analysis.
2.8. continuous variation method
a continuous variation method [14 – 16] was also applied
to determine the binding of plp to apogad65 and apogad67, and their stoichiometry. experimentally, a series of
apogad –plp solutions were prepared by addition of an
appropriate volume of 0.05 mg/ml apogad to an appropriate volume of 7.6  10 7 m plp. in each mixing
solution, the total mole concentrations of apogad and
plp were held constant (6.1  10 10 mol in 0.80 ml), while
the mole fraction of plp varied from 0 to 1.0. each mixed
solution was incubated for at least 2 h at 4 jc. its
fluorescence emission intensity was then measured at 20
jc. the excitation and emission wavelengths were 295 and
353 nm, respectively. duplicate fluorescence intensity readings were taken to ensure reproducibility. a job’s plot of
fluorescence emission intensity difference (df ) versus the
mole fraction of plp (vplp) was used to determine the
stoichiometry of binding from the ratio of mole fraction of
gad to plp.

hologad formation involves two steps: an initial association of the cofactor with apogad to form an intermediate
apogad –cofactor complex, followed by a significant conformational change [7,9,10]. the overall binding constant
(kb) is therefore the product of two individual formation
constants: the complex formation constant (kcpx) and the
conformational change constant (kcom) (fig. 1). values of
kb for the two isoforms were determined by fluorescence
quenching measurements. fig. 2a and b presents typical
plots of [( fo  f)/fo]  100 versus plp concentration
([plp]) for  xxxg850xxx  and  xxxg849xxx , respectively. fo and f
denote fluorescence emission intensities in the absence and
presence of plp. at [plp]>1.2  10 6 m, the fluorescence
change becomes much less as [plp] increases, and eventually reaches a plateau.
at the level of saturation of plp, the cofactor binds
to  xxxg850xxx  or  xxxg849xxx  with a stoichiometry of 1:1 [17].
a model of bimolecular equilibrium was therefore adop-

the parameter kb and fs can be determined by best
fitting of experimental data to eq. (6) using a sigma plot
program for windows (spss). excellent fitting of the data
to eq. (6) supported the model of bimolecular equilibrium in
eq. (1). table 1 lists the values of kb and their corresponding free energy change dgb( =  rt  lnkb). the results
reveal that  xxxg849xxx  exhibits a higher kb and a larger
negative dgb than  xxxg850xxx .
in a negative control, the binding of plp to bovine serum
albumin (bsa) was also determined. bsa has a molecular
weight similar to gad (66430 for bsa versus 65310 for
 xxxg850xxx  and 66551 for  xxxg849xxx  monomers). unlike gad,
bsa is not a plp-dependent protein and does not require
plp for its activity. however, the q-amino of lysine in bsa
can also react with the aldehyde group of plp to form schiff
base [10]. the value of kb was found to be (4.69 f
0.89)  106 m 1 for plp binding to the strong binding site
of bsa. this value is about one tenth or one half of that for
 xxxg849xxx  or  xxxg850xxx , respectively.

3.2. kinetics of hologad formation

where

stopped-flow fluorescence and uv/visible observations
are consistent with a two-step kinetics for hologad formation [7]. this two-step kinetics scheme can be empirically expressed by the following reactions:

k1 v¼ ½k1 k2 =ðk1 þ k2 þ½plpo

ð12aþ

k1 vi½k1 k2 =k1 ½plpo

ð12bþ

k1

fast step: apogad þ plp w apogad  plp;

ð7þ

k1

k2

combining eqs. (10c) and (12b) gives

slow step: apogad  plp w hologad;

ð8þ

k ¼ k1 v=½plpo

overall reaction: apogad þ plpwhologad

ð9þ

eq. (12) represents a pseudo-first-order reaction, and k1v
is the pseudo-first-order rate constant.
k1vand k2 can be determined by stopped-flow fluorescence or uv/visible measurements. according to the twosteps kinetics for the hologad formation, k1vshould be
dependent on [plp]o (eq. (12b)), and k2 should be independent of [plp]o (eq. (11)). stopped-flow uv/visible
results supported such criteria: k1vdecreases from 1.17 to
0.38 s  1 , and k 2 remains essentially unchanged at
5.31  10 3 s 1 for  xxxg850xxx , as [plp]o decreases from 60
to 20 am [7].

k2

where k1, k 1, k2, and k 2 are rate constants.
based on the steady-state approximation (the rate of
change in the intermediate complex, apogad – plp, is
negligibly small), the rate law for the fast step is:
d½apogad=dt ¼ ½k1 k2 =ðk1 þ k2 þ½apogad½plp
ð10þ
d½apogad=dt ¼ k½apogad½plp

ð10aþ

where
k ¼ k1 k2 =ðk1 þ k2 þ

ð10bþ

kik1 k2 =k1

ð10cþ

since k 1hk2 for [apogad – plp] to reach a steady-state
level. meanwhile, the rate law for the slow step is
d½hologad=dt ¼ k2 ½apogad  plp

ð11þ

where the k 2 [hologad] term is not included because k 2
is very small.
under the condition that [plp] is much larger than
[apogad], [plp] at time t is approximately equal to the
initial concentration of plp ([plp]o). then, eq. (10) becomes
d½apogad=dt ¼ k1 v½apogad

ð12þ

ð13þ

3.3. rate constants
fig. 3 plots the average relative fluorescence emission
intensity versus time (up to 50 s) for five stopped-flow
fluorescence measurements. nonlinear least-square exponential fitting to the curve gives k1v= 0.029 s 1 for the
intermediate apogad67 – plp complex formation (the fast
step). an analysis of similar plots (figure not shown)
collected up to a longer time gave k2 = 0.93  10 3 s 1
for the conformational change (the slow step), thus, the
faster step is approximately 30-fold quicker than the slower
step. the determined value of k2 is comparable to that
(0.67  10 3 s 1) obtained for plp binding to  xxxg8xxx  [20], a plp-dependent protein.
rate constant k2 in the slow step could also be determined by manual mixing fluorescence measurements (fig.
4). nonlinear least-square exponential fitting to the curve
ranging from 50 to 2000 s gives k2 = 0.94  10 3 s 1, in
excellent agreement with stopped-flow measurements.
merging of the data in figs. 3 and 4 leads to the curve in
fig. 5, which is consistent with a two-step kinetics of

fitting to fig. 5 gives the values of k1vand k2 (0.030 and
0.92  10 3 s 1, respectively), in excellent agreement with
those determined individually from figs. 3 and 4. table 2
compares the values of k1vand k2 for  xxxg849xxx  and  xxxg850xxx .
the results reveal that these values for  xxxg849xxx  are much
smaller than those for  xxxg850xxx .
stopped-flow uv/visible measurements confirmed the
two-step kinetics for plp binding to gad [7]. in the
negative control, the binding of plp to bsa was determined

as 113 f 22 s 1 for k1vand (27 f 5)  10 2 s 1 for k2.
these values are quite different from those for gad as
determined from figs. 3 – 5. this discrepancy may be
caused by a different kinetics mechanism for plp binding
to bsa.
3.4. formation constants and free energy changes
according to eq. (7), the intermediate complex formation constant (kcpx) can be determined from the ratio of the
forward (k1) and backward (k 1) reaction rate constants:

 xxxg849xxx  has a smaller negative value of dgcpx and a larger
negative value of dgcom than  xxxg850xxx .
3.5. job’s plots
plp titration to apogad65 in a continuous variation
method shows a maximum occurring at vplp (mole fraction of plp) = 0.53 (fig. 6a), indicating that the overall
molar binding ratio is 1:1 for plp to  xxxg850xxx . in contrast,
a job’s plot of plp titration to apogad67 reveals a
mixing curve with two apparent endpoints at vplp = 0.34
and 0.56 (fig. 6b). a similar mixing curve was also
observed in the binding of  xxxd81xxx  to poly b nucleic acid
[16]. fig. 6b indicates an initial binding ratio of 1:2 for
plp to  xxxg849xxx  prior to the saturation of plp, and
subsequently a binding ratio of 1:1 at the saturation level
of plp. at the saturation level of plp, the overall mole
ratio of 1:1 for plp to  xxxg850xxx  or  xxxg849xxx  is consistent

4. discussion
a comparison of binding and formation constants
between  xxxg850xxx  and  xxxg849xxx  reveals that the two isoforms
interact distinctly with the cofactor plp. a higher binding
constant (kb) or lower dissociation constant (kd) for  xxxg849xxx 
makes it more difficult to dissociate plp from hologad67
than hologad65. there is a much greater difference in
kcom than kcpx between  xxxg850xxx  and  xxxg849xxx . a much
greater kcom for  xxxg849xxx  supports a larger conformation
change in  xxxg849xxx  than  xxxg850xxx  upon the cofactor binding.
this larger kcom attributes to a higher kb for  xxxg849xxx  than
 xxxg850xxx . a conformational change in the enzyme upon the
cofactor binding was previously demonstrated by alterations
in the a-helical content and the thermal unfolding of the
enzyme [7,10].
the binding of plp is much slower for  xxxg849xxx  than
 xxxg850xxx , as evidenced by much lower values of k1vand k2
for  xxxg849xxx . a much quicker binding for  xxxg850xxx  is also
supported by a drastic difference in the initial response to
plp binding in the formation of plp –apogad intermediate complex, as observed by stopped-flow fluorescence
measurements. when plp was mixed with apogad65,
there was an initial sharp drop within 5 s of the mixing.
this change in fluorescence emission intensity within 5 s
was 4.5 times that occurring from 5 to 50 s [7]. under a
similar stopped-flow dead time setting, a plot of fluorescence emission intensity versus time for apogad67 exhibits no initial sharp drop (fig. 3).
a slower rate of holoenzyme formation for  xxxg849xxx  was
further confirmed by the experiments involving the inactivation of the enzyme. in those experiments, plp was added to a
mixture of apogad and glutamate (substrate). the mixing
resulted in the formation of hologad. the rate of decarboxylase reaction was measured as a function of the mixing time
to obtain the catalysis rate –reaction time response curve. by
exponential fitting of this curve, the rate of hologad67
formation was found to be 1.2  10 3 s 1 for  xxxg849xxx . this
value is comparable to 0.94  10 3 s 1 for k2, confirming a
slower rate of holoenzyme formation for  xxxg849xxx .
 xxxg850xxx  and  xxxg849xxx  are dimers consisting of two identical subunits and each subunit has one active site [21]. plp
binding to  xxxg850xxx  or  xxxg849xxx  exhibits a stoichiometry of
1:1 at the saturation level of plp [17]. this stoichiometry
implies that one plp molecule binds to each binding site,
and both sites are available for plp binding. job’s plot of
 xxxg850xxx  also reveals a stoichiometry of 1:1 at the saturation
level of plp. activity assay measurements for  xxxg850xxx 
showed that as [plp] rises,  xxxg850xxx  activity increases until
a mole ratio of 1:1 (plp to  xxxg850xxx ) before leveling off [17].
these results imply that the two binding sites in  xxxg850xxx 
have similar binding affinities, and the binding to the two

c.-h. chen et al. / biochimica et biophysica acta 1645 (2003) 63–71

sites occurs simultaneously. accordingly, binding of plp to
 xxxg850xxx  is faster, as demonstrated by larger values of k1vand
k2 and a sharp initial drop in stopped-flow kinetics measurements [7].
in contrast, job’s plot of  xxxg849xxx  reveals that one plp
molecule initially binds to one active site prior to the
saturation of plp, giving a mole binding ratio of 1:2. at the
level of saturation of plp, a second plp molecule binds to
another active site, giving an overall mole binding ratio of
1:1. these findings suggest that one binding site of  xxxg849xxx 
has a significantly higher affinity for plp than the other
binding site. the higher affinity binding occurs first, followed
by the lower affinity binding. due to this slower, lower
affinity binding, the overall binding process is slower for
 xxxg849xxx , as evidenced by smaller values of k1vand k2 and the
lack of initial sharp drop. activity assay measurements for
 xxxg849xxx  before and after the saturation of plp are consistent
with the job’s plot for  xxxg849xxx . before the saturation level of
plp,  xxxg849xxx  activity increases fast as [plp] rises. beyond a
mole ratio of 1:2, the activity increases much slower until it
reaches a mole ratio of 1:1 before leveling off [17].
job’s plots and activity assay measurements seemed to
suggest one class of binding site for  xxxg850xxx  and two classes
(nonequivalent) of binding site for  xxxg849xxx . the presence of
two classes of binding site was reported for plp binding to
 xxxd2177xxx  aminotransferease, another plp-dependent
protein [22], and for aspartate binding to aspartate receptor
of escherichia coli [23]. a negative cooperativity was
proposed that ligand-induced conformational change in
one binding site reduces the affinity for the ligand at the
subsequent binding site [23]. issues regarding the class of
binding site and related conformational change for  xxxg849xxx 
require further elucidation in future investigations.
results of binding constants, rate constants, kinetic profiles, job’s plots, and activity measurements suggested that
distinct interactions are key underlying factors attributing to
slower plp binding to  xxxg849xxx  than  xxxg850xxx , and less ease to
dissociate plp from hologad67 than hologad65. consequently,  xxxg849xxx  is more highly saturated by the cofactor than
 xxxg850xxx  [3,4]. the present work provided important information needed for an understanding of plp as an important
factor in regulating gad activity.
