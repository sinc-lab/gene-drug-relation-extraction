abstract
in asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (copd), the number of eosinophils and neutrophils in the lung is increased. one
described mechanism leading to the impaired clearance of these cells from the lung is the delay in their programmed cell death
(apoptosis). selective inhibitors of phosphodiesterases (pdes) are under development for the treatment of lung diseases because of their
anti-inﬂammatory and bronchodilator activity. the aim of the present study was to establish whether inhibitors of  xxxg1695xxx , pde4 and
pde5 modulate human eosinophil or neutrophil apoptosis or b2-adrenoceptor agonist- or cytokine-afforded survival. we also evaluated
whether a pde4 inhibitor could modulate the effect of a corticosteroid on eosinophil and neutrophil apoptosis. apoptosis was measured
by using the relative dna fragmentation assay and annexin-v binding.
inhibitors of pde4 ( xxxd3142xxx ; 0.1–10 mm) and  xxxg1695xxx  ( xxxd1698xxx ; 0.1–10 mm) delayed spontaneous eosinophil apoptosis maximally by
25% and 15%, respectively. a combination of a pde4 or  xxxg1695xxx  inhibitor (10 mm) with salbutamol (100 nm) further delayed eosinophil
apoptosis maximally by 42–49%. in neutrophils,  xxxd3142xxx  (10 mm) also decreased apoptosis with a maximal inhibition of 13%. the
combination of  xxxd3142xxx  (10 mm) and salbutamol (100 nm) produced a 27% inhibition of neutrophil apoptosis. inhibitor of cgmpspeciﬁc pde5 (zaprinast; 0.1–10 mm) did not affect eosinophil apoptosis and only slightly increased spontaneous neutrophil apoptosis.
the effect of budesonide on apoptosis was not signiﬁcantly modulated by a pde4 inhibitor in eosinophils or neutrophils.
the present results show that selective inhibitors of camp-hydrolyzing pdes ( xxxg1695xxx  and pde4) delay eosinophil apoptosis and, thus,
increase their survival in vitro. furthermore, b2-adrenoceptor agonists enhance the anti-apoptotic effects of  xxxg1695xxx  and pde4 inhibitors,
suggesting that such drug combinations may prolong eosinophil and neutrophil longevity in the lung.

eosinophils are considered to play a major role in
asthma and in the exacerbations of chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease (copd). in contrast, neutrophils are
thought to play a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of copd
and severe asthma [1]. both of these granulocytes release
many toxic substances such as proteases and oxygen
radicals, which cause tissue injury, remodelling and
contraction of bronchial smooth muscle [2–4]. in asthma

and copd, the number of these cells in lungs is increased
and their role in disease pathogenesis is suggested by the
ﬁnding that the removal of granulocytes from an inﬂamed
area is associated with the relief of symptoms. the number
of granulocytes in the lung tissue is determined by cell
maturation and death. apoptosis (programmed cell death)
is an efﬁcient method for eosinophil and neutrophil
removal from inﬂamed area without releasing their toxic
contents into the tissue. finally, apoptotic cells are
recognized and removed by phagocytes [5]. in vitro and
in vivo granulocyte apoptosis is delayed by cytokines such
as granulocyte-macrophage  xxxg526xxx 
(gm-csf) [2–4].
phosphodiesterases (pdes) are enzymes that hydrolyze
cyclic adenosine and guanosine 30 ,50 -monophosphates
(camp/cgmp) to inactive forms. inhibition of these
enzymes elevates camp and cgmp levels in the cells.
these second messengers affect the signalling pathways of
the cell, leading to phosphorylation of several enzymes.
thus, modulation of pde activity affects various cellular
functions. there are 11 known families of pdes [6].
different pdes are prominent in different cells or tissues.
for example, camp-hydrolyzing pde4 is present in
bronchial smooth muscle and inﬂammatory cells such as
eosinophils and neutrophils. clinically, selective inhibitors
of pde4 have attracted considerable attention because
they seem to have both anti-inﬂammatory and bronchodilating actions [7,8]. this is especially so in copd where
pde4 inhibitors are reported to reduce exacerbations [9].
pulmonary hypertension is a relatively common complication of severe copd. attempts to treat this condition
have been disappointing, but inhibitors of pde5, leading
to increased cellular content of cgmp, are a promising
group of drug candidates to treat this condition [10].
bronchoconstriction in asthma or copd is commonly
relieved with b2-agonists. however, b2-agonists may also
have pro-inﬂammatory effects such as the prolongation of
human eosinophil survival, which is probably mediated via
an increase in camp levels [11]. in eosinophils, selective
inhibitors of pde4 have anti-inﬂammatory properties by
suppressing degranulation, chemotaxis and adhesion [7].
these effects are quite similar to those induced by
increased intracellular camp in eosinophils [8]. in contrast, other camp-increasing agents may decrease eosinophil or neutrophil apoptosis, a property which may
promote granulocytic inﬂammation [11–17]. this suggests
that selective pde4 inhibitors might prolong the lifespan
of granulocytes. however, the effect of a combination of a
b2-agonist and pde4 or pde5 inhibitor on eosinophil or
neutrophil apoptosis remains unknown.
the aim of the present study was to evaluate the effect of
selective pde4 inhibitors on spontaneous apoptosis of
human eosinophils and neutrophils and on the survivalenhancing activity of gm-csf. in addition, as pde4
inhibitors and b2-agonists may emerge as a combination
therapy for asthma and/or copd, we also wished to
determine if these two classes of drug interact in regulating

granulocyte longevity. furthermore, as inhaled corticosteroids are widely used to treat asthma and copd, we also
evaluated whether a pde4 inhibitor could modulate the
effect of a corticosteroid (budesonide) on eosinophil and
neutrophil apoptosis.
2. materials and methods
2.1. eosinophil and neutrophil purification
blood (100 ml) for eosinophil experiments was obtained
from individuals with normal or slightly elevated blood
eosinophil counts. the donors were atopic or healthy.
approximately 50% of the donors were smokers. patients
with hypereosinophilic syndrome were excluded. for
neutrophil experiments blood (50 ml) was obtained from
healthy, non-smoking volunteers. eosinophils and neutrophils were isolated to 499% purity under sterile conditions
as previously reported [11,18,19]. the cells were resuspended at 106 cells ml1 and cultured in rpmi 1640, 10%
fetal calf serum and antibiotics. subjects gave informed
consent to a study protocol approved by the ethical
committee of the tampere university hospital (tampere,
finland).
2.2. determination of neutrophil and eosinophil apoptosis
in this study eosinophil and neutrophil apoptosis was
determined by using the relative dna fragmentation assay
in  xxxd3027xxx  iodide (pi)-stained cells and ﬂow cytometer
(facscan, becton dickinson, san jose, ca) as previously
described [11,19,20]. the cells showing decreased relative
dna content were considered to be apoptotic. the results
were conﬁrmed by showing the changes in phosphatidylserine (ps) expression on the surface of eosinophils
by using the annexin-v binding assay as previously
reported [21].
2.3. materials
pi, triton-x-100, salbutamol,  xxxd3142xxx , zaprinast,  xxxd1698xxx  and ro 20-1724 were obtained from sigma chemicals
co. (st. louis, mo, usa). gm-csf was obtained from
r&d systems europe (abingdon, uk). budesonide was
obtained from the alexis corp. (lausen, switzerland).
anti-cd16-microbeads and magnetic cell separation systems were obtained from the miltenyi biotec (bergish
gladbach, germany) and  xxxd3253xxx -paque from the pharmacia ab (uppsala, sweden). pde inhibitors were dissolved
in dmso. the ﬁnal concentration of dmso in the cells
was 0.1% and was shown not to affect apoptosis (n ¼ 6,
data not shown). a similar concentration of dmso was
added to the control incubations. salbutamol and  xxxg526xxx  were dissolved in rpmi 1640. budesonide was
dissolved in ethanol. pde inhibitors were added to the
cells 15 min before salbutamol, budesonide or gm-csf.
the cells were incubated under sterile conditions and the

incubation time for eosinophils was 17 h for the annexin-v
binding assay and 40 h for the relative dna fragmentation
assay. the incubation time for neutrophils was 17 h for the
relative dna fragmentation assay.
2.4. statistics
eosinophil and neutrophil apoptosis is expressed as an
apoptotic index (number of apoptotic cells/total number of
cells). results are expressed as the mean7sem. statistical
signiﬁcance was calculated by analysis of variance for
repeated measures supported by the student–newman–
keuls test. differences were considered signiﬁcant if
po0.05.
3. results
3.1. effects of pde inhibitors on spontaneous eosinophil
apoptosis
cultured human eosinophils undergo extensive spontaneous apoptosis in the absence of life-supporting cytokines.
after the culture for 40 h, the apoptotic index was
0.6270.03 (n ¼ 10). incubation of the cells with the
selective pde4 inhibitor,  xxxd3142xxx  (10 mm), decreased the
number of cells showing decreased relative dna content
(fig. 1a, c), suggesting that  xxxd3142xxx  had inhibited
eosinophil apoptosis. this delay in eosinophil apoptosis
by  xxxd3142xxx  was concentration-dependent (fig. 2a). the
maximal inhibition of apoptosis produced by 10 mm
 xxxd3142xxx  was 25%. to conﬁrm that  xxxd3142xxx  inhibits
eosinophil apoptosis,  xxxg166xxx -binding assay was employed.  xxxd3142xxx  reduced the number of eosinophils
expressing ps on the outer leaﬂet of the cell, a typical
hallmark of apoptosis (fig. 1b and d; table 1). to see
whether the effect was related to pde4 inhibition
speciﬁcally or more generally to inhibition of camphydrolyzing pdes, we also evaluated the  xxxg1695xxx  inhibitor,
 xxxd1698xxx . like  xxxd3142xxx ,  xxxd1698xxx  also increased eosinophil survival by decreasing apoptosis (fig. 2b). in contrast,
zaprinast, an inhibitor of cgmp-hydrolyzing pde5, had
no signiﬁcant effect on eosinophil apoptosis (fig. 2c). the
inhibition of apoptosis by  xxxd3142xxx  was not due to
induction of primary necrosis in human eosinophils, as

salbutamol, a selective short-acting b2-agonist, is widely
used to relieve bronchoconstriction in asthma and copd.
salbutamol reduced the number of cells with reduced
relative dna content (fig. 1a, e) suggesting delayed
apoptosis in eosinophils. the apoptotic indices were
0.6270.03 and 0.4770.04 in the absence and presence of
salbutamol (100 nm), respectively (po0.001, n ¼ 10). in
eosinophils, the average decrease in apoptosis compared
with control was approximately 25% (fig. 3). inhibition of
apoptosis was conﬁrmed by showing a decrease in the
number of cells expressing ps on the outer leaﬂet of the
cell, i.e. reduction in annexin-v+ cells (fig. 1b and f;
table 1). when eosinophils were cultured in the presence of
a pde4 inhibitor  xxxd3142xxx  and a ﬁxed concentration of
salbutamol (100 nm), the number of cells showing reduced
relative dna content (fig. 1e, g) or ps expression on the
outer leaﬂet (fig. 1f, h) was further decreased in a
concentration-dependent manner indicating reduced apoptosis (fig. 3a). to see whether a similar inhibition of
eosinophil apoptosis could be obtained with another
selective pde4 inhibitor, ro 20-1724 was employed. in
the presence of salbutamol the apoptotic indices were
0.4570.07 and 0.4170.07 in the absence and presence of
ro 20-1724 (30 mm), respectively (po0.05, n ¼ 6). furthermore, a  xxxg1695xxx  inhibitor,  xxxd1698xxx , also potentiated the
delay of apoptosis in salbutamol-treated eosinophils as
evidenced by reduced dna fragmentation (fig. 3b) or
reduced expression of ps on the outer leaﬂet of the
cells (table 1). the delay in eosinophil apoptosis by a
combination of salbutamol (100 nm) and  xxxd3142xxx  (10 mm)
was 4979% as compared with respective control in the
absence of these compounds (po0.001, n ¼ 6). similarly,
the combination of salbutamol (100 nm) and ro 20-1724
(30 mm) produced 3175% (po0.001, n ¼ 6) inhibition and

3.3. effects of pde inhibitors on gm-csf-induced
eosinophil survival
gm-csf is an anti-apoptotic cytokine involved in many
inﬂammatory reactions, including asthma and copd [3,4].
gm-csf reduced the number of cells with decreased
relative dna content (fig. 1a, i) and expression of ps on
the outer leaﬂet of the cells (fig. 1b and j; table 1)
indicating reduced apoptosis in eosinophils. the apoptotic
indices were 0.6270.03 and 0.0870.01 in the absence and
presence of gm-csf (10 pm), respectively (po0.001,
n ¼ 10). however, none of the selective pde inhibitors
( xxxd3142xxx ,  xxxd1698xxx  or zaprinast) tested had any signiﬁcant effect on gm-csf-afforded eosinophil survival at any
concentration (0.1–10 mm) examined as assessed by relative dna fragmentation or annexin-v-binding assays
(fig. 1i–l, table 1 and data not shown).
3.4. effects of pde4 inhibitor on budesonide-induced
eosinophil apoptosis
a corticosteroid, budesonide, is an anti-inﬂammatory
drug used to treat asthma and copd. budesonide (1 mm)
increased the number of apoptotic cells by 90% as
compared with control (po0.001, n ¼ 6, data not shown).
this increase in eosinophil apoptosis caused by budesonide
was not modulated by  xxxd3142xxx  (10 mm) (n ¼ 6, data not
shown).
3.5. effects of pde inhibitors on neutrophil apoptosis

mean7sem, n ¼ 5.

isolated and cultured human neutrophils undergo rapid
apoptosis. a pde4 inhibitor  xxxd3142xxx  (10 mm) reduced
spontaneous neutrophil apoptosis by 13%, whereas apoptosis was enhanced 7% by zaprinast (table 2).
salbutamol (100 nm) had no signiﬁcant effect on
neutrophil apoptosis (table 2) but in combination with
 xxxd3142xxx  (10 mm) neutrophil apoptosis was signiﬁcantly
delayed, approximately 27% (table 2). in contrast, the
combination of pde5 inhibitor zaprinast and salbutamol
did not signiﬁcantly affect apoptosis (table 2).
gm-csf reduced neutrophil apoptosis by 45%
(table 2). neither  xxxd3142xxx  nor zaprinast modiﬁed  xxxg526xxx -afforded survival of human neutrophils (table 2).
budesonide (1 mm) reduced spontaneous neutrophil
apoptosis maximally by 30%.  xxxd3142xxx  (10 mm) did not
modify the effect of budesonide on neutrophil apoptosis
(n ¼ 5, data not shown).
4. discussion

the combination of salbutamol (100 nm) with  xxxd1698xxx 
(10 mm) produced 4274% (po0.001, n ¼ 6) inhibition to
spontaneous apoptosis. as in the case of spontaneous
eosinophil apoptosis, selective inhibitor of pde5, zaprinast, had no signiﬁcant effect on eosinophil apoptosis in
the presence of salbutamol (fig. 3c).

in the present study we have shown that selective
inhibitors of camp-hydrolyzing pde4 and  xxxg1695xxx  delay
spontaneous eosinophil apoptosis. furthermore, a combination of a b2-agonist salbutamol and inhibitors of pde4
or  xxxg1695xxx  leads to a further reduction in eosinophil
apoptosis resulting in increased eosinophil longevity. in

isolated human neutrophils were cultured for 17 h in the presence and

addition, we showed that  xxxd3142xxx , a pde4 inhibitor,
delays spontaneous neutrophil apoptosis and that a
combination of salbutamol and  xxxd3142xxx  results in a
further increase in neutrophil survival by inhibiting
apoptosis.
bronchoconstriction in asthma and copd is commonly
relieved with b2-agonists. however, excessive use of b2adrenoceptor agonists has been associated with increased
risk of death or near death from asthma. one possible
mechanism contributing to this detrimental activity could
be the prevention of eosinophil clearance by inhibition of
apoptosis resulting in a more severe inﬂammatory response
and asthmatic symptoms. in fact, the use of salbutamol has
been associated with increased number of eosinophils in the
lung [11]. in line with this, b2-agonists have been reported
to increase human eosinophil longevity via inhibition of
apoptosis. this effect is probably mediated via an increase
in the intracellular level of camp [11]. in the treatment of
asthma or copd, a situation where in the future a patient
may use both a pde4 inhibitor and a b2-agonist, it is
important to know the effect of this combination on
eosinophil apoptosis. however, until now, the effects of
this drug combination on eosinophil apoptosis have not
been reported. our results indicate that the combination of
a b2-agonist and an inhibitor of camp-hydrolyzing pdes
delays eosinophil apoptosis leading to a signiﬁcant increase
in eosinophil longevity, which, in vivo, may aggravate
eosinophilia. salbutamol has been shown to delay eosinophil apoptosis at a concentration range of 10–1000 nm [11].
the mean maximum plasma concentration after a single
4 mg tablet of salbutamol is 30–60 nm [22,23]. after
inhalation of salbutamol the peak plasma concentrations
of salbutamol have been reported to be 7.5–23 nm [24].
however, the concentration of salbutamol in the lungs is
inevitably much higher as compared with the concentration
in the blood. thus the concentration of salbutamol

(100 nm) used in the present study can be considered to
be clinically relevant. pre-treatment with pde4 inhibitors
has been shown to possess anti-inﬂammatory effects and to
reduce eosinophilia in acute models of sensitized animals
[25–27]. this effect may be due to the inhibitory effect of
pde4 inhibitors on eosinophil adhesion and migration
[28–30]. however, at later time-points inhibition of
eosinophil accumulation by  xxxd3142xxx  has not been reported
in all the studies [26]. whether pde4 inhibitors reduce
existing, established eosinophilia similar to human asthma
remains unknown.
corticosteroids are currently used to treat asthma and
copd. in the present study, budesonide increased
eosinophil apoptosis and decreased neutrophil apoptosis
as previously described [31,32]. the effect of budesonide
was not signiﬁcantly modulated by a pde4 inhibitor in
either eosinophils or neutrophils. this suggests that pde
inhibitors do not reverse the effect of corticosteroids on
eosinophils or neutrophils.
although the anti-apoptotic effect of camp on spontaneous eosinophil apoptosis has been relatively well
demonstrated [11–13], little is known of the effects of
selective pde inhibitors. in one study, selective pde4
inhibitors have been reported to delay eosinophil apoptosis
at high-drug concentrations, ranging from 100 to 1000 mm
[14]. in the present study we report that  xxxd3142xxx  inhibits
eosinophil apoptosis at concentrations (1–10 mm) that are
similar to those reported to inhibit pde4 activity or to
produce speciﬁc effects in animals (0.2–30 mm) [33].
however, to our knowledge there are no studies where
the concentrations of pde inhibitors are determined on
epithelial lining ﬂuid. furthermore, we were not able to
identify any studies evaluating the plasma concentrations
of pde inhibitors after inhalation in humans. zaprinast,
an inhibitor of cgmp-hydrolyzing pde5, did not have any
effect on eosinophil apoptosis. this suggests that cgmp
has a negligible role in the regulation of human eosinophil
apoptosis. this conclusion is further supported by our
recent ﬁnding that  xxxd2738xxx , which reverses cytokineafforded eosinophil survival, does not mediate its effects
via cgmp in eosinophils [34].
in patients with copd and severe asthma, neutrophilic
inﬂammation is a prominent feature in the lung [1].
therefore, when developing novel drugs to treat copd
or asthma, it is important to ﬁnd out their effects on
neutrophil survival. for example, theophylline has been
shown to be of clinical beneﬁt in copd [35] and one
possible reason for this could be its pro-apoptotic effects
on neutrophils [14,36]. there is an evidence to suggest
that camp-increasing agents delay neutrophil apoptosis
[15–17]. however, according to a previous report, pde4
inhibitors have not been able to modulate neutrophil
apoptosis [37]. for the ﬁrst time, we have shown that
 xxxd3142xxx , a selective inhibitor of pde4, delays spontaneous
neutrophil apoptosis at a relatively small concentration
(10 mm). furthermore, a combination of a b2-agonist and
 xxxd3142xxx  leads to an increase in neutrophil survival.

severe pulmonary hypertension may complicate up to
5–10% of cases with advanced copd [10]. regardless of
whether inhibitors of pde5 will be used to treat pulmonary
hypertension associated with severe copd, the results of
our study suggest that pde5 inhibitors may not worsen
granulocytic inﬂammation. indeed, zaprinast failed to
enhance eosinophil or neutrophil longevity in the absence
or presence of salbutamol or the survival-prolonging
cytokine, gm-csf.
eosinophils isolated from asthmatic patients survive
longer when compared with eosinophils isolated from
healthy donors. this may be partly explained by cytokines
which decrease apoptosis and thus prolong eosinophil
survival [11,34,38]. in the present study, none of the
selective inhibitors of  xxxg1695xxx -5 affected gm-csf-afforded
eosinophil survival. our results are supported by one
earlier report with similar results [39], even though
apoptosis was not speciﬁcally measured in that study.
the results of our present investigation suggest that it is
unlikely that effects of gm-csf are signiﬁcantly dependent on camp or cgmp. in our study we used for example
 xxxd3142xxx  at concentrations that selectively inhibits pde4
[33] and found that it delays spontaneous apoptosis as well
as potentiates salbutamol-induced survival.
taken together our results suggest that eosinophil
apoptosis is delayed by selective inhibitors of pde4 and
 xxxg1695xxx . this effect occurs at pharmacologically relevant
drug concentrations. combination of a pde4 or  xxxg1695xxx 
inhibitor with a b2-agonist produces a further delay in
eosinophil apoptosis. this suggests that the effect of this
combination on pulmonary eosinophilia should be studied
before the large-scale use of a combination of these drugs
in daily clinical practice. our preliminary data also suggest
similar kind of effects in neutrophils.
