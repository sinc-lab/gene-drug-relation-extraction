inhibition of ionotropic neurotransmitter receptors by antagonists:
strategy to estimate the association and the dissociation rate
constant of antagonists with very strong affinity to the receptors1

received for publication, november 21, 1991

since binding of an agonist to an ionotropic neurotransmitter receptor causes not only
channel opening, but also desensitization of the receptor, inhibition of the receptor by the
antagonist sometimes becomes very complicated. the transient state kinetics of ligand
association and dissociation, and desensitization of the receptor were considered on the
basis of the minimal model proposed by hess' group, and the following possibilities were
proposed. 1) when an agonist is simultaneously applied to the receptor with an antagonist
whose affinity to the receptor is extremely strong and different from that of the agonist, it
is usually impossible to estimate the real inhibition constant exactly from the responses
because desensitization of the receptor proceeds before the equilibrium of the ligand
binding. simultaneous addition of the antagonist with strong affinity to the receptor may
apparently accelerate inactivation (desensitization) of the receptor. the association rate
constant of the antagonist can be estimated by analyses of the rate of the inactivation in the
presence and the absence of the antagonist. 2) a preincubated antagonist with a slow
dissociation rate constant, le., a very effective inhibitor, may cause apparent noncompetitive inhibition of the receptor, since the receptor is desensitized by an agonist as soon as the
antagonist dissociates from the receptor and the dissociation of the antagonist from the
receptor becomes the rate-determining step. a  xxxg456xxx  (nachr)
was expressed in xenopus oocytes by injecting mrna prepared from electrophorus
electricus electroplax and used for the experiments on inhibition by an antagonist. when
an antagonist such as  xxxd2174xxx  (gal), ( + )- xxxd3456xxx  (tub), or pancuronium (pan) was
applied simultaneously with acetylcholine (ach), it inhibited the nachr competitively
and apparently accelerated the rate of inactivation of nachr. on the other hand, it inhibited
the receptor in an apparently noncompetitive manner, and very effectively, when it was
preapplied to the receptor. these results were analyzed on the basis of our model. both the
association and the dissociation rate constant of the antagonists were estimated from the
inhibition experiments on the basis of the model. moreover, our results suggested the
presence of not only competitive binding sites with a high affinity in the nachr but also a
noncompetitive inhibitory site with a low affinity toward the antagonists. strychnine (str)
also inhibited  xxxg904xxx  (glyr) competitively when applied simultaneously with
glycine (gly), but inhibited glyr in a noncompetitive manner when it was preapplied.

antagonists of  xxxg456xxx  (nachr)
have been used widely as nondepolarizing neurotransmitter
blocking agents, le. skeletal muscle relaxants (1). so it is
important to study the inhibition mechanism of the nachr
by the antagonists (2), which bind competitively to the
agonist binding sites in the receptor and prevent the
channel-opening.
the nachr has been studied extensively and is the best
characterized channel protein gated by a ligand (3). the
response of the nachr is complex, since agonist binding
causes not only the channel opening, the current, but also
the inactivation, desensitization, of the receptor in the

millisecond to second time region (4). the minimal model
was proposed by hess' group based on measurements of
receptor-mediated ion translocation under various conditions in membrane vesicles of electrophorus electricus
electroplax by using a quenched-flow method (5, 6). this
model was extended to the responses of the nachr in the
presence of various kinds of inhibitors, on the assumption
that agonists and the inhibitors bound to the nachr and
reached equilibrium immediately before desensitization of
the receptor (7, 8). however, some antagonists have a very
strong affinity to the nachr, le. very slow dissociation rate
of the antagonist. in that case, desensitization of the nachr
will proceed before equilibrium of the ligand binding (9,

there is little change between the initial and the final
fractions of the receptor bound by the agonist(s) and the
antagonist(s). however, when their dissociation rate constants, i. e. equilibrium constants, are very different, inhibition of the nachr-response by the antagonist will change
with incubation time (9). in that case, it is impossible to
estimate a real equilibrium (inhibition) constant of the
antagonist exactly from the inhibition of nachr-induced
electrical responses, since desensitization of the receptor
proceeds before the final equilibrium of ligand binding, and
the response of the nachr in the presence of the antagonist
becomes very complicated.
for the special case whenfe_iof an antagonist is much
slower than fe_l) the following equation is derived if
recovery of the desensitized receptor is neglected and the
rate constant of desensitization of lrl form is expressed as

theory

-d[lrl]

simultaneous application of an agonist and an antagonist to nachr—to simplify the situation, we assume that
an agonist (l) and an antagonist (i) bind competitively to
two identical binding sites of nachr with equilibrium
constants, kx for an agonist and kt for an antagonist, and
that their concentrations are high enough to occupy most of
the two binding sites of the nachr, i.e. [l] >x, and [i] >
k, where [l] and [i] represent the concentration of the
agonist and the antagonist, respectively.
if an agonist and an antagonist are applied simultaneously to the nachr, they will bind to two identical binding
sites with first order association rate constants, k+l for an
agonist and fen for an antagonist. immediately, the nachr
will be occupied by the agonist and the antagonist with the
following fractions (12):
[lrl] 0 =
_

[mi]

2fe+lfem[l][i]

(3)

where dissociation of the antagonist was assumed to be
negligible because of the strong affinity to the nachr, that
is, only the transfer of lrl to lri form or to the desensitized form, ldl, was considered. the transfer rate of lrl
to lri form (the first term of the equation) is derived from
the dissociation rate of the agonist (2fe_l [lrl]) multiplied
by the antagonist-binding ratio to the free binding site (fen
[i]/(fen.[l]+fen[i])). this equation can be integrated,
yielding
[lrl] =
[lrl]0 exp-[2al l mi]/(*u.[l] + m i ] ) + *«]* (4)
this equation suggests that the rate of desensitization
(inactivation) of the nachr is apparently accelerated by
addition of the antagonist. some examples in the presence
of various concentrations of the antagonist were calculated
and are shown in fig. 1.
when [l] > [i], this equation can be expressed simply as

(1)

mi]

+ mlrl]

[lrl] = [lrl]0 exp-(2x 1 a +i [i]/[l] +

fej2)i

(5)

so we can estimate the association rate constant of the
antagonist, fen, from the ratio of inactivation rate constant

- ( :

where [lrl] 0 , [lri] 0 , and [iri]0 indicate the fraction of
the nachr occupied by two agonists, one agonist and one
antagonist, and two antagonists, respectively, after a very
short time. then they dissociate with the rate constants,
fe_l for the agonist and fe_, for the antagonist from the
nachr and rebind to the nachr again with the rate
constants, fen. and k+i. finally, their binding to the nachr
will reach equilibrium with the following fractions:

where kx and k, represent the equilibrium dissociation
constant of the agonist and the antagonist, respectively.

the nachr when an antagonist with a very strong affinity to
the receptor was applied simultaneously with the agonist to
the nachr and also when it was preapplied. the nachr
was expressed in xenopus oocytes by injecting mrna
prepared from e. electricus electroplax (11). when an
antagonist such as  xxxd2174xxx  (gal), ( + )- xxxd3456xxx 
(tub), or pancuronium (pan) was applied simultaneously
with an agonist to the oocyte, the nachr was inhibited in a
competitive manner by the antagonist. however, the
nachr was apparently inhibited noncompetitively by the
antagonist when it was preincubated with the antagonist.
these results were interpreted on the basis of the proposed
theory and both the association and the dissociation rate
constant of the antagonists were estimated. the inhibition
of  xxxg904xxx  (glyr) by strychnine (str) was also
examined similarly.

where aw« and ka are the rate constants of inactivation of

preapplicadon of antagonists to the nachr—binding of
agonists to an ionotropic neurotransmitter receptor causes
not only channel opening, but also inactivation (desensitization) of the receptor. when a concentrated agonist is
applied to the receptor preincubated with an antagonist,
whose concentration is high enough to occupy most of the
binding sites, but is low enough to allow replacement by the
agonist, the following scheme 1 can be considered;

step 3

step 2

where r, d, l, and i represent the receptor, the desensitized receptor, the agonist, and the antagonist, respectively. rl form is assumed to cause channel opening. if
association of the agonist to the receptor (step 2) is much
faster than dissociation of the antagonist from the receptor
(step 1), scheme 1 can be expressed simply as:

r»rl"

rl-

scheme 2

k.,
step 1

step 2

where jli and ka represent the dissociation rate constant of
the antagonist and the rate constant of desensitization,
respectively. this scheme is a simple consecutive two step
reaction model and [rl] is expressed as
[rl] =
where [ri] 0 is the initial concentration of ri form. we can
estimate the rate constant of jl, from the time course of the
vol. 112, no. 4, 1992

fraction of rl form, le. the time course of the response, if
we know the desensitization rate constant of hi.
however, the nachr has two agonist binding sites, which
makes the scheme more complex. on the basis of the
minimal model with two identical binding sites in the
nachr proposed by hess et al. (5), the following scheme
3 can be considered:

iri-

lri-

(k „ - 2k l2)

ldl

ldi

scheme 3

where lrl includes both closed (lrlcom) and open
(lrlopen) forms of the nachr with two agonists, whose
rate of equilibrium is assumed to be much faster than the
rate of desensitization of the nachr. the following differential equations can be derived from the scheme:
-d[iri]/dt = j
(8)
since the association rate of an agonist to the receptor is
very fast, initial fractions of the receptor, [lri] 0 and
[lrl] 0 , are assumed to be equal to [ri] 0 and [r] o , which
are the initial fractions of the receptor with one antagonist
and the free receptor, respectively, before addition of the
agonist. these fractions can be calculated from the inhibition constant of the antagonist, kt.
the fraction of lrl form, [lrl], which is proportional
to the current, is expressed as

materials and methods
chemicals—acetylcholine (ach) bromide, gallnmine
(gal) triethiodide, ( + )- xxxd3456xxx  (tub) chloride, pancuronium (pan) bromide, and strychnine (str) nitrate were
purchased from sigma chemicals, st. louis. other chemicals were of reagent grade.
preparation of mrna and xenopus oocytes—an electric
eel, e. electricus, was purchased from shimonoseki pet
center, shimonoseki. wistar male rats (about 100 g
weight) were purchased from kyudo, tosu. poly(a) mrna
was prepared from e. electricus electroplax or rat brain by
the procedure described by maniatis et al. (15).
adult female frogs {xenopus laevis) were purchased
from hamamatsu seibutsu kyozai, hamamatsu. xenopus
oocytes were prepared according to the procedure of
kusano et al {16). oocytes at stages v and vi were
micro-injected with the mrna and incubated in modified
barth solution (88 mm nacl, 1 mm kcl, 2.4 mm nahc0 3 ,
0.33 mm ca(no3)2, 0.41 mm cacl2, 0.82 mm mgso«, 7.5
mm tris, ph 7.6) containing 25 mg/liter penicillin, 50 mg/
liter streptomycin, and 1% calf serum, at 15-18'c for 2-7
days before electrophysiological measurements.
electrophysiology—membrane current of the nachr
evoked by an agonist was measured by the voltageclamping method, using a voltage clamp amplifier, cez1100 (nihon koden kogyo, tokyo). the xenopus oocyte
was continuously perfused with normal frog ringer solution
(115 mm nacl, 1 mm kcl, 1.8 mm cacl2, 5 mm tris, ph
7.2) via a gravity feed system usually at the flow rate of 2
ml/min {17). the oocyte was placed on the bottom of a
small chamber and was impaled with two microelectrodes
filled with 3 m kcl, one for monitoring membrane potential
and the other for injecting current for clamping the
membrane potential to — 50 mv {18). the electrical response of the current was filtered by a p-84 filter (nf
electronic instruments, kanagawa).
inhibition of the receptor when an agonist and an
antagonist were applied simultaneously—the response
of the injected oocyte was measured by the application of
various concentrations of ach. the response caused by 2

mm ach was taken as a control. the mixture of an
antagonist and various concentrations of ach was bathapplied to the oocyte and the currents were measured
electrophysiologically by the voltage-clamping method.
the inhibition of the nachr by the antagonist was evaluated from the ratio of the response in the presence of the
antagonist to that in the absence of the antagonist. when
the same oocyte was used for several hours, controls were
occasionally taken to revise the time-dependent variation
of the amount of the synthesized nachr in the oocyte.
when the effect of the antagonists on the rate of inactivation of the receptor was examined, 1 mm ach for pan or 10
mm ach for tub and gal was applied simultaneously. both
the flow rate of the bath application and the chart speed of
the recorder were increased.
to examine the effect of str on glyr expressed in the
oocyte {19), 1 /*m str was simultaneously applied to the
oocyte with various concentrations of gly. the response
was normalized to that caused by 10 mm gly.
inhibition of the response when an antagonist was
preincubated with the receptor—the current of the injected oocyte was measured as a control by application of 0.5 or
10 mm ach. after washing of the oocyte with frog ringer
solution for 30 min, the oocyte was continuously perfused
with various concentrations of an antagonist for 5 min.
then the current was measured by application of 0.5 or 10
mm ach with the antagonist. the ratio of this peak current
to the control was obtained as the remaining activity.
in the inhibition of glyr by str, various concentrations of
gly with 200 nm str were applied to the oocyte injected
with rat brain mrna after application of 200 nm str for 1
min. the response was normalized to that caused by 10 mm
gly.
results
figure 4 shows some examples of inhibition of nachrmediated current by antagonists, gal, tub, and pan, when
they were applied simultaneously with ach. the doseresponse relationship of ach and that in the presence of the
antagonists are shown in fig. 5. addition of the antagonist
caused an approximately parallel shift of the dose-response
curve of ach, which indicates apparent competitive inhibition of the nachr by these antagonists. as described in the
theory, we cannot estimate the inhibition constant kt
accurately, because nachr is desensitized before true
equilibrium between nachr, ach and the antagonist is
established. here we tentatively estimated apparent k,
using the equation of competitive inhibition at equilibrium.
on the basis of the minimal model, the equilibrium constant between ach and the nachr, ki, was estimated to be
76 ii m (13). the following equation has been obtained from
the simple competitive inhibition model (7):

in this scheme 3, the rate constants of desensitization of
irl and lrl form, kai and ki2 for ach, were estimated to
be 7.7 and 15.5 s"1 at 20'c, respectively, from the rate
constants of the minimal model (13) and their temperature
dependency {14). the time courses of the response under
various conditions were calculated by a computer with the
assumption that k-u is equal to 2fe_i2 and that all the binding
sites are occupied by the antagonist at first. some examples
are shown in fig. 2. with the decrease of jfe_12, broadening
of the response and decrease of the peak response are
shown in fig. 2. the peak response was calculated at
various values of k-,2 and is plotted against the rate
constant, &_i2 in fig. 3. it is possible to estimate the rate
constant, k-l2, from the peak response, using this relationship between the rate constant and the peak response in fig.
3.
when the experimental data were analyzed, each fraction of the receptor, [r] o , [ri]o, or [iri] 0 was calculated
from the inhibition constant, kit and the response curve

and the dissociation rate constant, k-i2, was estimated from
the results in fig. 8 using eq. 9 described in the theory.
however, the dotted theoretical curve drawn by using the
estimated k-n value could not explain the results well at
high concentrations of the antagonist (fig. 8). it was
reported that tub has both competitive and noncompetitive
inhibitory sites in nachr; the former has high affinity (120
nm) and the latter has low affinity (4 //m) for the receptor
(22). so we analyzed the results, assuming two kinds of
binding sites, a competitive one with high affinity and a
noncompetitive one with low affinity, in the receptor. the
dissociation rate constant of the antagonist, k-l2, was
estimated from the result of the inhibition by lower
concentrations of the antagonist (dotted curves in fig. 8),
assuming that noncompetitive binding was negligible at the
low concentrations of the antagonists. the noncompetitive
inhibition constants were estimated by fitting them to the
results at the higher concentrations of the antagonist (solid
curves in fig. 8). this noncompetitive inhibition may be a
voltage-dependent block of open channels by antagonists as
reported by colquhoun et al (22). the values of the
dissociation rate constant and noncompetitive inhibition
constant of the antagonists are summarized in table ii.
however, clear noncompetitive inhibition was hardly
observed, even when the antagonist at a concentration high
enough to induce the noncompetitive inhibition was simultaneously applied with ach. this may be due to the slow
application of ligands, that is, the real concentration of the
antagonist was lower at first than that of added antagonist.
it was also reported that the two competitive inhibitory
sites of antagonists were nonequivalent (2). so further
experiments and analyses with better accuracy are required to clarify these problems in future.
even now very little is known of the rate at which an
antagonist associates with or dissociates from the nachr,
though a number of attempts have been made to investigate
these rates of the antagonist. the value of the dissociation
rate constant of tub was reported to be 700-1,000 s~\ as
estimated by a voltage-jump relaxation method (2). in
conjunction with an inhibition constant of 200 nm, this
would imply a very fast association rate constant of over
3.5-5.0xl0*m~'-s" 1 , which seems too fast, since the
upper limit of the diffusion-controlled encounter of the
receptor and its ligand is estimated to be 10 s -10' m~' • s"1
(23). our estimated value of about 70 s"1 for tub implies
an association rate constant of 3.5xl0*m~ 1 -s" 1 , which is
within the upper limit. in our experiment of simultaneous
application of ach and tub, the association rate constant,
fen, of tub was estimated to be 8.5xlo 7 m"'-s"' from the
acceleration of the inactivation. this value of k+, is not so
far from the above value and seems reasonable.
ionotropic neurotransmitter receptors such as y- xxxd2177xxx  and gly receptor are thought to be composed of
similar subunits to those of the nachr (24-26) and to
follow a similar kinetic model (5,19, 27). so our hypothesis
and the model are important generally to analyze the action
of effective antagonists on the ionotropic receptors which
show desensitization. some researchers have observed
noncompetitive inhibition of glyr by str, a very effective
antagonist of glyr, when it was preapplied (28, 29), though

the equilibrium constant of ach, kx, was estimated to be
76 //m from the dose-response curve in fig. 5 on the basis
of the minimal model proposed by hess et al. (5). this
value of the constant is almost equal to that estimated from
ion flux measurement in membrane vesicles of e. electricus
by using a quenched flow method (23). using this constant
kt and the results in fig. 5 where ach and the antagonists
were simultaneously applied to the oocyte, the apparent
competitive inhibition constants of gal, tub, and pan were
estimated to be 2.4 ^m, 1.3 ^m, and 66 nm, respectively,
tentatively using a simple competitive inhibition model at
equilibrium as proposed in the previous paper (7), since the
antagonists caused parallel shifts of the dose-response
curve of ach in fig. 5. the results were apparently well
analyzed by the simple competitive inhibition model and
the order of inhibitory effectiveness of the antagonists was
the same as that reported before (2). however, the estimated value of k, was several times as large as the binding
constants obtained from a radiolabeled ligand binding
experiment (9) (table ii). this is possibly because desensitization of the receptor occurs before the completion of
equilibrium of agonist- and antagonist-binding to the
nachr, as mentioned in the theory.
as predicted in the theory (fig. 1), simultaneous application of ach and the antagonists accelerated the rate of
apparent inactivation (fig. 6 and table i). the association
rate constant of the antagonists, &,.,, was estimated from
eq. 6, using the ratio of inactivation in the presence and the
absence of the antagonists, kinna/ xxxg959xxx   xxxg962xxx , and fe2 of 15.5 s"1.
the estimated constants, k+,b, are shown in table i.
unfortunately, these estimated k+1 s possibly contain some
error for two reasons. one reason is that the dissociation
rate constant of the antagonist, k-l2, which is estimated
later, is not sufficiently small in comparison with  xxxg959xxx   xxxg962xxx , even
though k-l2 is assumed to be very small. the other reason
is that the time resolution of our measurements was not
good enough to allow us to observe the real rate of desensitization exactly, and the rate of desensitization observed in
our experiment was apparent and much slower than the
real one. further improvement of the ligand-application
system such as laser photolysis of a caged compound (20)
will be necessary to carry out accurate measurements in
future.
when the antagonist was incubated for 5 min before
application of ach, inhibition of the response by the
antagonist increased with the antagonist concentration but
was almost independent of the agonist concentration (figs.
7 and 8), which suggests noncompetitive inhibition. as
mentioned in the theory, even a simple competitive binding
of an antagonist to the nachr causes apparent noncompetitive inhibition when the dissociation rate constant
of the antagonist is comparable to or less than the rate
constant of desensitization. since it was impossible to
estimate the exact equilibrium constant of the antagonist
from the inhibition of the nachr response, the real k, of
the antagonist was estimated from radiolabeled ligand

the competitive binding of gly and str to gly binding sites
in the receptor was observed in binding experiments with
radiolabeled ligands (30). our electrophysiological measurements also showed that str inhibited glyr competitively when it was simultaneously applied with gly, while
it inhibited glyr in a noncompetitive manner when it was
preapplied (fig. 9). however, this discrepancy has not been
explained clearly (28, 29). the equilibrium dissociation
constants of gly and str in non-desensitized glyr were
estimated to be 570 //m (19) and 35 nm (30), respectively.
though the rate constants of desensitization of glyr, ku
and  xxxg959xxx   xxxg962xxx , which are necessary for the exact calculation of
k-l2, have not been obtained yet, the mmrimiim rate of
desensitization of glyr was reported to be about 1.9 s"1
(29), which is ten times less than that of nachr. considering the experiment in fig. 9 and the calculation in fig. 3, the
dissociation rate constant of gly from the receptor, k-n,
was roughly estimated to be about 5s" 1 , which suggests a
value of the association rate constant, fe^, of 1.4 x108 m"1 •
s~'. these estimated values of the constants seem reasonable. so it is likely that str inhibits glyra in a noncompetitive manner when it is preapplied, since its dissociation from the receptor is slow and becomes the ratedetermining step.
