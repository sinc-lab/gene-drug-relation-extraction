summary
heparin possesses antimetastatic effects that were related to
various molecular mechanisms beyond anticoagulant activities.
the ability of heparin to interfere with the function of adhesion
receptors in the metastatic course appears as a promising therapeutic approach. this refers to numerous findings that heparin
attenuates metastasis in a selectin-dependent manner. we recently demonstrated that heparin interferes with the integrin
 xxxg1203xxx  on murine melanoma cells binding to  xxxg2406xxx . to confirm this activity and to obtain further insight into molecular recognition of heparin by  xxxg1203xxx , we investigated the inhibition of
 xxxg1203xxx  mediated binding of human melanoma mv3 cells to immobilised  xxxg2406xxx  by different heparins.the size of heparin has
an important impact on inhibition. unfractionated heparin
(ufh) and  xxxd3379xxx , a  xxxd1997xxx  (lmwh)
representing a mean of about 18–20 monomers, displayed high

inhibitory activity. fractionating  xxxd3379xxx  to 14–18 monomers
reduced inhibition slightly, while the pentasaccharide fondaparinux was without effects.to confirm molecular recognition of  xxxd3379xxx  byvla-4, a surface acoustic wave-biosensor was applied.
a  xxxg1203xxx  containing membrane preparation of mv3 cells was immobilised at the sensors to allow for detection of kinetic binding constants of  xxxd3379xxx  compared to  xxxg2406xxx .  xxxd3379xxx 
binds to  xxxg1203xxx  with affinity in the low micromolar range
(4.61×10–6 m), which clearly indicates specific molecular recognition. furthermore,  xxxd3379xxx  displays a nearly identical koff
compared to  xxxg2406xxx  (5.13×10–3 s-1 versus 3.44×10–3 s-1) which
is evident for interference with the ligand binding.the data provide evidence for a direct confirmation of heparin binding to
 xxxg1203xxx  and thus, contribute to understand the antimetastatic activity of heparin.

introduction
tumor cell metastasis may lead to serious complications in
cancer. thus, its effective treatment is required to inhibit tumor
growth or to improve survival of cancer patients. the mechanisms of metastasis are complex and versatile including
multiple steps that allow tumor cells to disseminate and to proliferate. cell adhesion molecules (cams) are crucially involved in
the metastatic cascade promoting cell-cell, cell-endothelium,
cell-platelet, and cell-extracellular matrix (ecm) interactions.
thus, anti-adhesion strategies appear as promising approaches
in oncology (1). the selectins, a class of carbohydrate-binding
proteins, recognise several structures on tumor cell surfaces, leukocytes, platelets, and endothelial cells, thereby creating
multiple binding possibilities. this leads to the formation of
microemboli enabling the tumor cells to survive and to arrest in
the microvasculature (2). beside selectins, integrins and their li-

gands of the immunoglobulin superfamily participate in adhesive interactions between tumor cells and the endothelium, such
as the integrin alpha4beta1 (very late activation antigen-4,  xxxg1203xxx ) and
vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 ( xxxg2406xxx ). both, the selectin
and the  xxxg1203xxx  mediated binding pathway contribute to experimental metastasis of tumor cells bearing the respective ligands/
receptors, such as malignant melanoma cells (3, 4), whereas their
activities are even of clinical relevance (5). we and others were
able to show that especially melanoma cells utilise the vla4/ xxxg2406xxx  binding pathway to directly adhere to the endothelium, whereas selectins are involved in forcing platelet-cell interactions and in polymorphnuclear neurophils (pmns)-facilitated
extravasation (6, 7).
for prophylaxis and treatment of thrombosis, heparin has
been the drug of choice for several decades. with the findings
that – in addition to the prevention of thromboembolism – heparin prolongs the survival of cancer patients (8), research is going

on to identify the molecular mechanisms. currently assumed heparin actions beside anticoagulation are (i) inhibition of p- and
l-selectin, (ii) inhibition of angiogenesis via stimulation of  xxxg2266xxx  ( xxxg2266xxx )-release, (iii) modulation of
growth factor binding, and (iv) inhibition of  xxxg1076xxx  enzymatic activity (9–12). taking into account that  xxxg1203xxx  plays a
dominant role in melanoma cell adhesion, its inhibition seems to
be essential to decrease metastasis. in a recent study, we showed
for the first time that the adhesion of murine b16f10 melanoma
cells to  xxxg2406xxx  could be inhibited by heparin in vitro and suggest  xxxg1203xxx  as a novel heparin target (6). although a combination of different techniques was used, the final proof of a direct binding between heparin and  xxxg1203xxx  was lacking. indeed,
there are observations of others, who refer to the binding ability
of heparin to the integrins alphaiibbeta3, alphambeta2 (mac-1), alphaxbeta2 (gp
150,95) (13–15) and to specific integrins on a transfected erythroleukemic cell line in dependence on the integrin beta-subunit
(16). however, none of these studies was associated with the
antimetastatic properties of heparin.
to strengthen our hypothesis of heparin/ xxxg1203xxx  interactions,
the present study investigates the inhibitory effects of different
heparins on human mv3 melanoma cell adhesion to  xxxg2406xxx 
under flow conditions. unfractionated heparin (ufh),  xxxd1997xxx  (lmwh)  xxxd3379xxx , a fraction of  xxxd3379xxx  representing a proportion of 14, 16, and 18 monosaccharides as well as fondaparinux were included. the results show a
clear dependence of the inhibitory capacity on the molecular
weight of heparin.
to detect heparin/ xxxg1203xxx  binding on a molecular level, a surface acoustic wave (saw) biosensor was applied. on basis of the
piezoelectric properties, mass changes on the surface of sensors
can be detected as phase shift of an applied acoustic wave. for
detailed principles of measurement, the underlying physical
mechanisms, and the mathematical bases for determination of
kinetic binding constants the reader is referred to (17) and for
several applications to (18–20). saw-based cell experiments
have been applied mainly using bacteria, bacteriophages, and
yeasts (21–23), but also mammalian cell interactions (24, 25).
in the present study, the saw method was applied for the
first time at adhesion receptor mediated interactions, i.e. between  xxxg1203xxx  expressing mv3 cells and  xxxg2406xxx . by immobilising a membrane preparation of mv3 cells on the sensor surface we were able to determine binding kinetics of  xxxg2406xxx  and
 xxxd3379xxx  to  xxxg1203xxx  and thus, confirmed heparin binding to
 xxxg1203xxx .
therefore,  xxxg1203xxx  is coming into light as an attractive target
for the antimetastatic effects of heparin leading to a decrease of
human melanoma cell adhesion.

materials and methods
cell culture
all cell lines were cultured at 37°c in humidified atmosphere
containing 5% co2.
the human melanoma cell line mv3 was grown in rpmi
1640 supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum (fcs). for
subcultivation, mv3 were detached at 80–90% confluency using
edta-solution (0.2 g/l edta × 4 na) for 3 min at 37°c. all

reagents were from sigma-aldrich chemie gmbh (taufkirchen, germany).
human umbilical vein endothelial cells (huvecs) were cultured in endothelial cell growth medium. subcultivation was
performed at 60–80% confluency using detachkit in accordance with the provided protocol. huvecs and all reagents were
obtained from promocell gmbh (heidelberg, germany).
antibodies and adhesion molecules
the humanised anti- xxxg1203xxx  (alpha-chain) mab natalizumab was
kindly provided from biogen idec gmbh (ismaning, germany).
goat anti- xxxd2207xxx -horseradish peroxidase (hrp) was purchased from antibody online (aachen, germany).
function-blocking anti-human  xxxg2049xxx  mab and recombinant human  xxxg2406xxx  fc (human igg1) chimera were obtained
from r&d systems gmbh (wiesbaden-nordenstadt, germany).
sulfated polysaccharides
ufh 1 was kindly provided by dr annamaria naggi (“g ronzoni” institute for chemical and biochemical research, milan,
italy). ufh 2 (heparin-natrium 5000 ratiopharm®) was purchased from ratiopharm gmbh (ulm, germany),  xxxd3379xxx 
was from leo pharma gmbh (neu-isenburg, germany) and
fondaparinux from sanofi-aventis gmbh (frankfurt/m, germany). the fraction of  xxxd3379xxx  consisting of 14, 16, and 18
monosaccharides was isolated by size-exclusion chromatography on biogel-p10 as described by bisio et al. in the present
issue of t.h.
flow chamber assay
adhesive interactions of mv3 cells with  xxxg2406xxx  fc chimera or
huvecs were determined under physiological flow conditions.
glass slides containing 0.2 µg  xxxg2406xxx  or confluent huvecs,
stimulated with 50 ng/ml human  xxxg2296xxx  (tnf)-alpha
(sigma-aldrich gmbh, taufkirchen, germany) for 4 to 6 hours,
were incorporated into a parallel plate flow chamber as described
in detail in our previous investigations (6, 26). briefly, the flow
chamber was mounted onto an inverted microscope. pbs (ph
7.4) as flow medium was driven by hydrostatic pressure at a shear
rate of about 200 s-1. experiments were performed after treatment
of 1×106 mv3 cells suspended in fcs-free rpmi 1640 with 1
mm mn2+ for 5 min at 37°c (stimulated cells) in comparison to
untreated cells. to determine the contribution of  xxxg2049xxx  on
mv3 cell interaction with huvecs, 10 µg of a function-blocking
anti-human  xxxg2049xxx  mab were mixed with 1×106/100 µl mv3
cell suspension and put into the flow chamber.
for inhibition experiments, heparin preparations and natalizumab were used at 500 µg (according to 150 iu ≈ 1 mg) and
5 µg, resp., and compared with the inhibitor-free control experiment (cells in fcs-free medium only). the substances were
added to 100 µl stimulated mv3 cells and incubated for 5 min at
37°c prior to injection into the flow system.
adhesion behavior of the mv3 cells was monitored over a
period of 5 s. video sequences were captured with the camera
csc-795 (pacific corporation, tokyo, japan) and analysed with
the software imagoquant multitrack-avi-2 (mediquant gmbh,
lützen, germany).

saw biosensor measurements
biosensor investigations were performed using a s-sens™ k5
surface acoustic wave biosensor supplied by biosensor gmbh,
bonn, germany.
immobilisation of  xxxg2406xxx  and natalizumab on the
saw sensor
gold-coated sensors (biosensor) were incubated in a solution of
11-mercaptoundecanoic acid (10 mm) in ethanol abs. forming a
self-assembled monolayer by binding of the sulfur headgroups to
the gold surface. the carboxyl groups were activated with 200
mm n-ethyl-n-(dimethylaminopropyl)-carbodiimide (edc)
and 50 mm n-hydroxysuccinimide (nhs) to bind 50 µg/ml natalizumab and  xxxg2406xxx , respectively, forming carboxylamides.
an excess of activated unreacted nhs esters was blocked by 1 m
ethanolamine (ph 8.5). the amount of bound protein was determined using the protocol described in (17).
cell binding experiments to  xxxg2406xxx  and natalizumab
after immobilisation of  xxxg2406xxx  and natalizumab, respectively,
a baseline equilibration in pbs containing 1 mm ca2+ and mg2+
was performed for 30 min. in that time, 5×106 mv3 cells were
suspended in 1 ml running buffer containing 1 mm mn2+. the
number of injected cells was optimised based on the findings
that 1×103 cells was the minimum to detect binding events, while
numbers >1×106 did not lead to increased binding. the flow rate
to ensure sufficient time for cell-ligand interaction and to prevent unspecific binding due to sedimentation was 100 µl/min.
for inhibition experiments, 500 µg  xxxd3379xxx  in 10 µl buffer
were added to 1×106 cells, injected into the biosensor system and
rinsed either over immobilised  xxxg2406xxx  or natalizumab. binding of cells with or without inhibition was measured as shift of
phase. since the penetration depth of a love wave sensor is restricted to the near sensor surface, only mass changes caused by
ligand-receptor/antibody interactions close to the sensor surface
were detected without balancing the whole cell.
preparation of membrane vesicles
mv3 cells were harvested from 80% confluently grown cell
dishes. cell membrane vesicles were prepared according to the
protocol described in detail in (27). all steps were performed at
4°c. membrane vesicles were homogenised using a potter-elvejhem homogenisator. the protein yield was determined in an
amido black-protein assay (28). presence of  xxxg1203xxx  was determined applying a sds-page under non-reducing conditions.
proteins from the gel were plotted on a polyvinyldifluoride
membrane at 100 v, 350 ma for 60 min. unspecific binding sites
on the membrane were blocked using a solution of skim-milk
protein (5%) in tbs with 0.2% tween.  xxxg1203xxx  was detected
using natalizumab and anti- xxxd2207xxx -hrp as secondary antibody. chemoluminescence was detected after treating the membrane with immobilontm-western chemoluminescent kit
(millipore corporation, billerica, usa) according to the manufacturer’s protocol.
immobilisation of membrane vesicles on saw sensors
gold-coated saw sensors were inserted into an aqueous solution of 1-beta-thioglucose (10 mm) over night to form an adhesion

layer for the membrane vesicles. after rinsing briefly with ethanol and drying under a stream of nitrogen, the sensor chips were
inserted into the flow chamber of the saw biosensor and a baseline equilibration was performed for 30 min in pbs containing
1 mm ca2+ and mg2+. the amount of injected membrane vesicles
was defined by a dilution series of the membrane vesicles. a
1:10-dilution of the membrane vesicles in running buffer was assumed to be appropriate after detection experiments using
 xxxg1203xxx  binding antibody natalizumab.
determination of kinetic binding constants of  xxxg2406xxx ,
 xxxd3379xxx , and fondaparinux
 xxxg2406xxx ,  xxxd3379xxx , and fondaparinux, resp., were injected in
dilution series between 10–12 m and 10–3 m to interact with the
immobilised membrane vesicles. association and dissociation
events were detected as phase shifts indicating binding and unbinding events at the membrane vesicle surface. kinetic binding
constants were calculated from the slopes of the obtained curves
applying a 1:1-binding model.
statistics
data represent means ± standard deviations of at least three independent experiments. comparisons were performed by the unpaired student’s t-test (*p<0.05, **p<0.01, ***p<0.001).

results and discussion
 xxxg1203xxx -mediated binding of mv3 melanoma cells to
 xxxg2406xxx  can be blocked by different heparins – insight
into structural requirements
in order to simulate the situation of tumor cell adhesion to the endothelium, the binding of mv3 cells to confluent,  xxxg2296xxx -treated huvecs was determined under physiological flow
conditions. tnf-alpha induces  xxxg2406xxx  expression on huvecs in
a time-dependent manner with near maximal expression being
seen after 4 to 6 hours of stimulation (29). it can be noticed that
mn2+-treatment enhanced cell adhesion in a statistically significant extent from 76.5% ± 6.9% up to 87.3% ± 5.8% at 4 s (fig.
1a). beside chemokines, the treatment with mn2+ is an experimentally accepted way of activation of almost all integrins. thus,
the mn2+-induced increased cell adhesion points to a contribution of integrin-mediated binding pathways. since the vla4-blocking mab natalizumab was able to decrease cell binding
(76.0% ± 4.2%) to the level of unstimulated cells, an explicit
 xxxg1203xxx  dependency can be assumed.  xxxg1203xxx  positivity of mv3
was ensured by flow cytometry (data not shown).
in addition to  xxxg2406xxx , a variety of other cell adhesion molecules are expressed/induced on huvecs, such as  xxxg2049xxx .
mv3 cells possess binding ability to  xxxg2049xxx  fc chimera as investigated by flow cytometry (data not shown). to determine the
contribution of  xxxg2049xxx  expressed at the cellular level to mv3
cell binding, experiments on huvecs were carried out using a
function-blocking  xxxg2049xxx  mab. a slight, statistically not significant decrease in cell adhesion could be observed upon  xxxg2049xxx  blockade, which indicates that  xxxg2049xxx  is of minor relevance regarding the mv3/huvec interaction. this fact is of
special importance for our inhibition studies on heparins, since
endothelial  xxxg2049xxx  is another target of heparin action (3).

schlesinger et al. heparin binding to  xxxg1203xxx 

figure 1: inhibition of  xxxg1203xxx -mediated mv3 cell binding by heparin. a) adhesion of 1×106 mn2+-stimulated mv3 cells to confluent
huvecs under flow conditions was determined after preincubation of
the cells with 500 µg of the indicated heparins and 5 µg natalizumab,
resp., for 5 min. in some cases, the influence of a function-blocking  xxxg2049xxx  mab was investigated by adding 10 µg of the mab to 1×106/100
µl mv3 cell suspension prior to injection into the flow system. after 5

min of sedimentation, the flow was started and the adhesion behavior
was monitored over the indicated time range. b) influence of different
heparins and heparin fractions on mv3 cell adhesion to immobilised
 xxxg2406xxx  under flow conditions was determined as described above.
data are presented as mean values ± sd (n³3; *p<0.05, **p<0.01,
***p<0.001 with respect to stimulated mv3 cells). ms, monosaccharide;
ufh, unfractionated heparin.

however, to rule out any  xxxg2049xxx -mediated cell adhesion, inhibition studies on huvecs were performed at concomitant application of the  xxxg2049xxx  mab. the effects of different heparin
preparations were analysed after a preincubation period of 5 min
with stimulated cells according to our previous investigations
(6). figure 1a illustrates that both ufh 2 and  xxxd3379xxx  were
able to reduce cell adhesion (74.3% ± 11.6% and 72.5% ± 9.7%,
resp.) to the same extent as natalizumab in the presence of the
 xxxg2049xxx  mab. in contrast, fondaparinux failed to further decrease cell adhesion. these results reveal that heparin blocks
 xxxg1203xxx -mediated mv3 cell binding under physiological conditions using an endothelial cell layer. however, the observed inhibitory effects are relatively weak and probably hindered by unspecific binding events, which impede the determination of clear
structure-activity relationships.
thus, further inhibition studies were performed on immobilised  xxxg2406xxx  fc chimera allowing to focus more closely on the
involvement of  xxxg1203xxx  (fig. 1b). as observed for the adhesion
experiments on huvecs, mn2+-treatment led to an increase of
percentaged cell adhesion, which is much more pronounced on
the isolated ligand. we initially used  xxxd3379xxx , which also displayed a high inhibition capacity regarding p- and l-selectin
(30).  xxxd3379xxx  reduced the mv3 cell adhesion to isolated

 xxxg2406xxx  in a statistically significant manner. it is known that
 xxxd3379xxx  contains more high molecular weight heparin fragments than other lmwhs. in order to investigate whether molecular weight of heparin has an impact on the blocking capacity
of  xxxg1203xxx / xxxg2406xxx  interaction, two ufhs and the pentasaccharide fondaparinux have been applied. preincubation of
cells with each of the ufhs decreased cell adhesion stronger
than  xxxd3379xxx , while fondaparinux revealed no inhibitory effect. although it is not clear, which saccharide component is responsible for  xxxg1203xxx  inhibition, a correlation between molecular
size and inhibitory efficiency might be assumed. moreover, exceeding a critical size appears as essential for inhibition. since a
smaller  xxxd3379xxx  fraction (mw 5,600 da compared to 6,500 da
of  xxxd3379xxx ) representing only fragments of 14, 16, and 18
monosaccharides displayed significant activity (slightly reduced
compared to  xxxd3379xxx ), the critical threshold of heparin size
seems to be between five and 14 monosaccharides. in further investigations, even smaller heparin fractions should be applied to
further focus on this aspect, as well as ufh derivatives differing
in sulfation or n-acetylation to obtain more information on the
heparin binding epitope to  xxxg1203xxx .
our findings on size dependency correspond to others, who
were able to show that only certain heparin fractions inhibit the

schlesinger et al. heparin binding to  xxxg1203xxx 

this appears to be due to synergistic effects with sdf-1alphainduced phosphorylation of kinases implicated in integrin function (31). consequently, inhibition of this process by heparin
might result in opposed effects leading to impaired  xxxg1203xxx  regulation. additionally, the functional heparin binding domain of
 xxxg1076xxx  was shown to facilitate cell adhesion and spreading
by clustering of cell surface  xxxg2036xxx -1 and  xxxg2036xxx -4 on
human tumor cells as a consequence of initiating different signaling pathways (32). however, the influence of these  xxxg1076xxx -dependent actions by heparin might be excluded for our
discrete experimental conditions using the recombinant immobilised ligand. moreover, the integrin activation performed in the
present study was chemokine-independent. thus, our data point
to a direct interaction between heparin and  xxxg1203xxx .

figure 2: detection of kinetic binding constants using a saw
biosensor. a) a  xxxg1203xxx  containing membrane preparation was immobilised on the surface of a saw sensor chip.  xxxg2406xxx  was injected under
flow to bind to  xxxg1203xxx . b) the applied voltage induces an acoustic love
wave in the guiding layer of the sensor chip. the phase of this wave depends on the mass load on the sensor surface. binding of  xxxg2406xxx  to
 xxxg1203xxx  led to a phase shift. unbinding of  xxxg2406xxx  due to buffer rinsing
led to returning of the initial phase. c) phase shift versus time diagrams
for increasing concentrations of injected  xxxg2406xxx  can be analysed using
a non-linear curve fitting in area i for the concentration depending association rate constant (kobs) and in area ii for the dissociation rate constant (koff). kobs is a function of concentration and according to the
equation kobs = kon c + koff, the association rate constant (kon) can be determined via plotting kobs versus c and applying a best linear fit. the
underlying mathematics are explained in detail in (17). the equilibrium
dissociation rate constant (kd) is determined by kd = koff/kon.  xxxg2406xxx ,

binding of integrin alphaxbeta2 to complement fragment ic3b (15).
these indications on heparin blockade of mv3 melanoma cell
adhesion to a  xxxg2406xxx  substratum are in line with our previous
suggestion of  xxxg1203xxx  being a novel heparin target (6). however,
other mechanisms might contribute to the observed heparin effects, such as inhibition of  xxxg1076xxx  that is known to have
multiple cellular effects beside ecm-degradation. for instance,
sotnikov et al. were able to demonstrate that the  xxxg1203xxx -mediated binding of t-cells to ecm components and to  xxxg2406xxx  is
increased in the presence of enzymatically quiescent  xxxg1076xxx .

biosensor-based investigation of mv3 binding
to get a deeper insight into the molecular mechanisms of mv3
binding, we applied a saw biosensor. the principle of measurement is schematically illustrated in figure 2.  xxxg2406xxx  fc chimera were immobilised on the sensor surface to investigate the
binding of mv3 cells. binding of 1×106 stimulated mv3 cells
was measured versus binding of 1×106 mv3 cells under preincubation with 500 µg  xxxd3379xxx . figure 3a shows that  xxxd3379xxx 
effectively suppressed mv3 binding to  xxxg2406xxx  in agreement
with the microscopic assay.
next, we immobilised the  xxxg1203xxx  antibody natalizumab to
the saw sensor surface and detected the binding of 1×106 stimulated mv3 cells as well as inhibition by  xxxd3379xxx  (fig. 3b). assuming that an interaction between cellular  xxxg1203xxx  and natalizumab is based on binding of the alpha-subunit of  xxxg1203xxx , further insight into heparin binding activity can be obtained. thus,  xxxd3379xxx  may bind directly to the alpha-subunit of  xxxg1203xxx  and cause a
steric hindrance for natalizumab binding. another possibility is
the conformational change of  xxxg1203xxx  after  xxxd3379xxx  binding
leading to a prevented binding to the alpha-subunit allosterically.
however, the data strengthen our hypothesis of direct heparin/
 xxxg1203xxx  interaction, since we could also exclude (i) binding of natalizumab and of  xxxd3379xxx  to immobilised vcam and (ii) binding of  xxxg2406xxx  and of  xxxd3379xxx  to immobilised natalizumab.
for concentrations between 1×10–9 m and 1×10–4 m neither interaction nor even unspecific binding could be detected (data not
shown).
detection of kinetic binding constants of  xxxd3379xxx 
and  xxxg2406xxx  using a  xxxg1203xxx  membrane preparation
in order to investigate the heparin/ xxxg1203xxx  binding on a molecular level, a membrane preparation of mv3 cells was performed
to obtain  xxxg1203xxx -containing membrane fractions. the presence
of  xxxg1203xxx  in the membrane vesicles was confirmed by sdspage and western blot leading to bands at 280 kda for the
 xxxg1203xxx  heterodimer, at 150 kda for the alpha-subunit and at 80 kda,
which could represent a  xxxg2296xxx  of the alpha-subunit
(33) (data not shown). membrane vesicles were immobilised in
situ on a saw sensor chip that had been prepared with a layer of
1-beta-thioglucose. injections of increasing concentrations of
 xxxg2406xxx  and  xxxd3379xxx , respectively, led to binding events that
were analysed by non-linear curve fitting based on a monomolecular growth model. an exponential decay model for the deter-

to the a-subunit of  xxxg1203xxx .  xxxd3379xxx  induced a significant inhibition of mv3 cell binding to
natalizumab, which might indicate a specific interaction of
 xxxd3379xxx  with the a-subunit
of  xxxg1203xxx . data are presented

mination of the corresponding binding kinetics was assumed
(table 1).
we were able to detect kinetic constants of  xxxg2406xxx  binding
to  xxxg1203xxx  in a biosensor assay for the first time. the binding affinity in the mean nanomolar range is obvious for a cell adhesion
receptor. the rapid association rate constant confirms the potency of this interaction as a mediator of leukocyte rolling in the process of cellular immune response. the dissociation rate constant
is slower than the koff of the selectins (e.g. koff = 1.4 s-1 for  xxxg2049xxx /psgl-1 interaction (34)) and refers to the role of  xxxg1203xxx 
to slow down the rolling and to initialise firm adhesion. the only
data available for  xxxg1203xxx / xxxg2406xxx  interaction are published by
chigaev et al. (35). they determined kd values between
3.31×10–8 m and 48.9×10–8 m depending on activation with
mn2+ and ca2+ using  xxxg1203xxx -positive u937 cells and fluorescently-labelled  xxxg2406xxx  in flow cytometry experiments. they
postulated that affinity changes drive change of  xxxg1203xxx  avidity
most importantly and could also show that intracellular activation as well as shear forces mainly affected the dissociation
rate leading to different affinities. although our approach is
neither cell-based nor can it be influenced by mn2+, ca2+ or shear
forces due to lacking signaling pathways, the obtained data are in
good accordance with these findings. thus, the kinetic data of
 xxxg1203xxx / xxxg2406xxx  interaction have to be regarded as affinity data
for one single activation state of  xxxg1203xxx  and have to be compared
to the data of  xxxd3379xxx .
 xxxd3379xxx  binds to  xxxg1203xxx  with an affinity in the low micromolar range, which clearly indicates a specific molecular recognition. the data underscore the potency of  xxxd3379xxx  as an in-

hibitor of  xxxg1203xxx -mediated interactions. although  xxxd3379xxx 
binds  xxxg1203xxx  with a hundredfold slower association rate constant
than  xxxg2406xxx , it displays a nearly identical dissociation rate constant. this appears as an important aspect with respect to inhibitory capacity, since the dissociation rate constant was shown
to correlate with inhibition in case of the selectins (36). since the
pentasaccharide fondaparinux could neither show an effect in the
table 1: kinetic binding constants of  xxxg2406xxx  and  xxxd3379xxx 
binding to  xxxg1203xxx  in an immobilised membrane preparation.
data were extracted from sensor signals of injections of increasing concentrations of  xxxg2406xxx  and  xxxd3379xxx  using the monomolecular growth
model. binding kinetics were determined assuming an exponential decay
model via non-linear curve fitting using origin7.5tm (additive, friedrichsdorf, germany). kobs values extracted from the ascending part of
the sensor signals for every concentration and were plotted versus concentrations of  xxxg2406xxx  and  xxxd3379xxx , resp. a linear best fit was applied
to the data using the equation kobs = kon c + koff with kon = association
rate constant (on-rate) and koff = dissociation rate constant (off-rate), c
= concentration of the injected analyte. data are presented as means ±
sd (n>3).

schlesinger et al. heparin binding to  xxxg1203xxx 

cell rolling assay nor binding could be detected in the saw assay,
the specific recognition of  xxxd3379xxx  by  xxxg1203xxx  is confirmed.
in summary, following a recent hypothesis of inhibiting vla4-mediated cell binding by heparin, this study provides the first
clear indication that a lmwh binds directly to  xxxg1203xxx  with an affinity in a low micromolar range. although a clear size-dependency could be obtained, further experiments using modified heparins are necessary to evaluate structural requirements of this
recognition process. these results focus the interest on  xxxg1203xxx  as
a novel target for heparin in antimetastatic approaches and should
be considered as worthwhile to continue research in this field.
