abstract:  xxxg1579xxx  (enos) is a self-sufficient p450-like enzyme. a p450 reductase
domain is tethered to an oxygenase domain containing the heme, the substrate (l-arginine) binding site,
and a cofactor, tetrahydrobiopterin (bh4). this ‚Äútriad‚Äù, located at the distal heme pocket, is the center of
oxygen activation and enzyme catalysis. to probe the relationships among these three components, we
examined the binding kinetics of three different small heme ligands in the presence and absence of either
l-arginine, bh4, or both. imidazole binding was strictly competitive with l-arginine, indicating a domain
overlap. bh4 had no obvious effect on imidazole binding but slightly increased the kon for l-arginine.
l-arginine decreased the kon and koff for cyanide by two orders, indicating a ‚Äúkinetic obstruction‚Äù
mechanism. bh4 slightly enhanced cyanide binding.  xxxd2738xxx  (no) binding kinetics were more complex.
increasing the l-arginine concentration decreased the no binding affinity at equilibrium. in both bh4abundant and bh4-deficient enos, half of the no binding sites showed a sizable decrease of the binding
rate by l-arginine, with the rate of no binding at the other half of the sites remaining essentially unaltered
by l-arginine, implying that the two heme centers in the enos dimer are functionally distinct.

 xxxd2738xxx  synthase (nos)1 is an unusual self-sufficient
p450 cytochrome catalyzing the conversion of l-arginine to
 xxxd2738xxx  (no) and  xxxd2429xxx  (1-4). there are three
known isozymes of nos; the constitutive  xxxg1577xxx 
( xxxg1577xxx ) and  xxxg1579xxx  (enos) require calmodulin for
enzyme activity, whereas the  xxxg1578xxx  (inos) contains
tightly bound calmodulin (1-4). all three isozymes have a
common bidomain structure with the reductase domain
containing fad, fmn, and nadph binding sites and the
oxygenase domain containing the heme center and binding
sites for l-arginine and tetrahydrobiopterin (bh4) (1-4). the
main function of the reductase domain is to provide reducing
equivalents to the heme center in the oxygenase domain
where the key chemistry of l-arginine conversion occurs.
several x-ray crystallographic structures for the inos and
enos oxygenase domains have been reported recently (57). the overall structure surrounding the heme center is
conserved and confirms the proximity between the heme
center and the l-arginine and bh4 binding sites, which
together make up an active site ‚Äútriad‚Äù. these crystal‚Ä† this work was supported by u. s. public health service grants

lographic data provide a framework for studying structurefunction relationships and the reaction mechanism in nos.
a useful approach to characterizing the dynamic relationship among the active site triad elements involves kinetic
examination of the interaction of nos with various active
site ligands through spectroscopic measurements (8-13).
data of this sort has been accumulating steadily, providing
useful information about subtle differences in ligand binding
between nos isozymes and revealing the influences of
l-arginine and bh4 on heme ligand binding (14-21). this
approach, however, suffers from potential difficulties in data
interpretation. nos samples lacking a full complement of
essential cofactors are likely to display heterogeneous ligand
binding behavior, and the role of bh4 as a ligand and/or a
cofactor has not been well-defined. interpretation of ligand
binding based on apparent rate constants can be quite
difficult, especially in this multiple-ligand binding system.
to begin to address these issues, we have established an
expression system that produces enos with a full complement of heme and flavins and have treated bh4 as a cofactor
instead of as a ligand in the binding studies. both equilibrium
and kinetic binding measurements were performed in the
presence and absence of l-arginine, and a mechanistic model
was derived that satisfies binding data from both types of
binding experiments. we focused on three ligands, imidazole,
cn-, and no, that interact with ferric enos heme in distinct
ways. our data and computer modeling indicate that bh4,
present as a cofactor, has a small effect on binding of these
ligands by fixing the heme orientation to give a rigid
framework. on the other hand, l-arginine has a strictly

competitive effect on imidazole binding, whereas the effect
on cn- and no binding is most properly interpreted by an
‚Äúobstruction‚Äù model. the detailed analyses of the ligand
interactions in the enos oxygenase active site should be
useful in understanding the oxygenase catalysis that involves
l-arginine, bh4, and small heme ligand, including oxygen
and no. this information will also help in defining the
structural differences not revealed by x-ray crystallography
between enos and other nos isozymes.

experimental procedures
materials. l-[2,3,4,5-3h]arginine and 2‚Ä≤,5‚Ä≤-adp-sepharose
4b were purchased from amersham pharmacia biotech. inc.
(22). bh4 was obtained from schircks laboratories (jona,
switzerland).  xxxd2738xxx  and argon were from h. p. gas
products, inc. (houston, texas). no was further purified
by passage through a column packed with koh pellets. all
other chemicals were obtained from sigma. sf9 cells were
purchased from pharmingen.
expression and purification of human enos. recombinant human  xxxg1579xxx  (enos) was
prepared using a baculovirus expression system as previously
described (22-24) with slight modifications. for expression
of enos, sf9 cells cultured in suspension were infected by
recombinant baculoviruses at a multiplicity of infection of
2. sepiapterin (10 ¬µm) and  xxxd148xxx  (100 ¬µm)
were added to the culture medium 24 h after infection and
hemin chloride (2 ¬µg/ml) was added 48 h after infection.
the cells were harvested 72 h postinfection and washed with
phosphate buffered saline. purification of recombinant enos
was as reported previously (9).
expression and purification of bovine enos. bovenospcw was kindly provided by dr. bettie sue siler
masters of the university of texas health science center
at san antonio. the bov-enos was expressed in escherichia
coli and purified as described by martaÃÅsek et al. (25). these
bh4(-) enos preparations were stored at liquid nitrogen
in buffer containing 50 mm tris, ph 7.5, 10% glycerol, and
0.15 m nacl. bh4(+) enos was prepared by incubation of
the purified bh4(-) enos protein with 500 ¬µm bh4 for
about 2 h during sample concentration by centriprep
(amicon). extended incubation with bh4 did not enhance
further bh4 incorporation but led to heme loss. excess bh4
was removed by gel filtration through a 30-cm bio-gel
p-6dg gel (bio-rad) column. protein fractions were pooled,
concentrated by centriprep 30 (amicon), and stored in liquid
nitrogen in the same buffer as described above for the
bh4(-) enos preparations.
assays of enzyme activity. nos activity was assayed by
measuring conversion of l-[3h]arginine to l-[3h]citrulline
(22, 23), using a 3-min incubation at 37 ¬∞c.
biopterin determination. the bh4 content of purified
enos was measured using the procedure described previously (24).
protein determination and pyridine hemochromogen
assay. protein was determined by the bca (26) or modified
lowry (27) methods or by quantitation of tryptophan by
mcd with l-tryptophan as standard (a282 ) 5500 m-1 cm-1)
(28). the heme content of purified enos was measured by
pyridine hemochromogen assay (29).
stopped-flow experiments. binding and dissociation rate
constants, kon and koff, were determined by kinetic measure-

a
a is  xxxd220xxx ; b is imidazole; c is cyanide or no; e is bh4(-) or
bh4(+) enos; k1, k2, k3 are the on rate constants; and k-1, k-2, k-3 are
the off rate constants.

ments on an applied photophysics model sx-18mv stoppedflow instrument with rapid-scan diode-array accessory at 24
¬∞c. quantitation of ligand binding used the molar absorbance
coefficients for ferric enos (400 ) 100 mm-1 cm-1), for
the ferric complexes (imidazole, 432 ) 110 mm-1 cm-1;
cyanide, 438 ) 87 mm-1 cm-1; and no, 442 ) 105 mm-1
cm-1) or the difference coefficient for the cyanide complex
(‚àÜ442-400 ) 97 mm-1 cm-1) and the no complex (‚àÜ444-398
) 95 mm-1 s-1). for no binding measurements, the enos
samples were made anaerobic in a tonometer by five cycles
of vacuum and equilibration with argon gas on an anaerobic
train. working no solutions were prepared by dilution of
no-saturated anaerobic buffer (2 mm at 21 ¬∞c) into 0.1 m
 xxxd3449xxx , ph 7.5, 10% glycerol, and 0.1 m nacl.
formation of ferric-ligand (cyanide, imidazole, no) complexes was monitored at the wavelengths indicated in the
text. the time courses were analyzed by nonlinear regression
to single- or multiple-exponential functions. estimated kon
and koff values were derived from the slope and intercept,
respectively, in plots of kobs versus ligand concentrations.
computer modeling. the scop program (simulation
resources inc., redlands, ca) was used for kinetic simulations and for fittings of single-wavelength kinetic data to
the mechanistic model described in scheme 1. the values
for k1 (1.0 √ó 106 m-1 s-1) and k-1 (1.0 s-1) for l-arginine
binding were determined by binding competition with imidazole (9) or assigned based on a kd of ‚àº5 ¬µm obtained
from static equilibrium titrations for the e. coli-expressed
enos (data not shown). values of k2 and k-2 were obtained
from data from single-ligand kinetic measurements (9; and
this study). model a has no floating variables; there are two
floating variables in model b (k3 and k-3), but they are
interdependent and constrained by the measured dissociation
constant, kd. values for k3 and k-3 consistent with the
observed kinetic data were obtained by iterative simulations.
it is assumed that l-arginine binding rate constants are not
influenced by the binding of cyanide or no, as indicated by
the use of k1 and k-1 in both eqs b1 and b4.

(values ranging from 71 to 135 mm-1 cm-1) in the literature
for enos samples prepared in different laboratories (12, 3032; and our data) and the related variation in heme content,
from 0.4 to 1/monomer (12, 30, 31).
we have analyzed four different enos samples, three
different  xxxg1577xxx  samples, and one inos sample for their
heme content and extinction coefficient. two b-type heme
proteins, sperm whale myoglobin and horseradish peroxidase,
and two p450s, bm3 and 1a1, were used as standards. three
methods were used for protein determinations as described
in experimental procedures. the absorbance at 393 nm of
l-arginine-treated enos, which is fully high-spin enos, was
used as our reference to determine the molar absorption
coefficient. the absorbance at 393 nm was about 3% higher
than the absorbance at the 400-nm peak in purified enos,
which contains both high- and low-spin heme. the flavin
components have ‚àº10% contribution at both 393 and 400
nm, as estimated from the spectrum of the isolated reductase
domain (data not shown). after correction for the flavin
absorbance, the heme extinction of all nos samples we
analyzed ranged from 78 to 97 mm-1 cm-1, very similar to
published values for typical p450 proteins.
we succeeded in preparing enos and its reductase domain
with fad and fmn stoichiometries close to 1 (table 1) by
adding riboflavin to the cell medium (for bacterial expression
system only) and supplementing the cell extract with fmn
and fad at the stage of cell breakage. we were also able to
further increase the heme content of enos and the oxygenase
domain to full stoichiometry by adding  xxxd148xxx 
and hemin to the sf9 cell medium. as shown in table 1,
four preparations of enos purified by adp-sepharose
affinity chromatography showed a heme content close to
unity, a substantial improvement from an earlier value of
0.52 (table 1). both fad and fmn stoichiometries were
also close to unity. surprisingly, even the bh4 content was
significantly increased, to about 0.7/monomer. it thus appears
that increasing heme levels in enos improves bh4 incorporation. the enos sample expressed from the bacterial
system already has a high heme content (‚àº0.8) and a full
complement of flavin cofactors, but further treatments used
for the sf9 expression further enhanced the heme stoichiometry to unity and the biopterin content to 0.7 (data not
shown). the isolated oxygenase domain from sf9 expression
prepared by the same method showed an optical spectrum
significantly improved in quality; the a280/a398 ratio was
decreased from 2.8 ( 0.5 (n ) 4) to 1.56. the heme content
of this oxygenase is 0.9:1 monomer, significantly better than
the values of ‚àº0.5:1 for oxygenase domain samples prepared
earlier. improvement in heme content is also indicated by
the decrease of the heme extinction from 122 to 90 mm-1

cm-1 after we obtained the enos preparation with stoichiometric amount of heme (table 1).
effect of l-arginine on the binding kinetics of imidazole
to enos. it was shown earlier that binding of imidazole and
l-arginine appears to be competitive to each other due to
overlap in binding domains (9, 12, 13). in our previous
published study using baculovirus-expressed enos, equilibrium binding competition was performed between imidazole and l-arginine. kd and ki values and kinetic imidazole
binding was measured at 0.5 mm imidazole and l-arginine
varying from 0.05 to 2.5 mm to obtain the on and off rate
constants for l-arginine (9). to test this competition hypothesis further, enos preparations with a full complement of
cofactors were used, and computer simulations were performed against the simple competition model (model a) in
scheme 1. moreover, the effects of both l-arginine and bh4
were assessed under different experimental conditions.
in the first set of experiments, e. coli-expressed enos,
which is bh4-deficient [bh4(-) enos], was reacted with a
mixture containing 1 mm imidazole and a content of
l-arginine varying from 0.025 to 0.5 mm (figure 1a). at
low l-arginine concentrations, i.e., 25 and 50 ¬µm, there was
a discernible initial increase of formation of imidazole-ferric
enos complex as a432 increased, followed by a dissociation
of imidazole due to l-arginine binding (figure 1a). when
l-arginine concentrations were greater than 0.05 mm, only
imidazole dissociation was observed. in the second experiment, e. coli-expressed enos reconstituted with bh4 as
described in experimental procedures, was first preincubated
with different amounts of l-arginine and then mixed with
25 mm imidazole in the stopped-flow apparatus to measure
the kinetics of imidazole complex formation (figure 1b).
the binding kinetics appears to be exponential, and the
equilibrium level of enos-imidazole complex decreased
with increasing levels of l-arginine. while the appearance
of the data in figure 1, panels a and b, are very different,
the observed rate and extent of imidazole complex formation
in both data sets were fit exactly by model a using the rate
constants obtained previously for individual imidazole and
l-arginine binding (figure 1 and table 2) (9). in the third
set of experiments, bacterial [bh4(-) and bh4(+)] enos
(figure 2) were first treated with 25 ¬µm l-arginine and
reacted with various amounts of imidazole. each reaction
showed biphasic kinetics with a rapid increase in a432 in less
than 50 ms followed by another slower phase that plateaued
in a few seconds. this same data (figure 2) can be fit by a
two-exponential function interpreted as a heterogeneity of
the enos heme. the latter interpretation is, however, very
misleading in terms of binding mechanism. in contrast,

constant values are successful for all three sets of data (lines
in figures 1 and 2). this indicates that the biphasic kinetics
in figure 2 is not due to heme heterogeneity and that bh4
has minimal influence on the binding behaviors of either
imidazole or l-arginine.
simulations based on model a demonstrated that bh4
binding enhanced l-arginine binding because a larger kon

value for l-arginine had to be used to simulate our binding
data that associated with bh4(+) enos than simulation for
the bh4(-) enos and accounts for the smaller amount of
fast phase observed in figure 2 (compare panel a vs b).
the fast phase is concluded to be the imidazole binding to
l-arginine-free enos molecules as the on and off rates in
this phase match those of free enos.

figure 3: effects of l-arginine on cyanide binding equilibrium
with bh4(+) enos and bh4(-) enos. (a) binding of cyanide to
bh4(+) enos (2.5 ¬µm) was monitored by a398-444 nm in the absence
(closed circles) and presence of 2 (open squares), 10 (open circles),
and 50 ¬µm (open triangles) l-arginine concentrations. the experiment containing 1 mm l-arginine was essentially superimposable
to that containing 50 ¬µm l-arginine. (b) binding of cyanide to
bh4(-) enos containing 0 (closed circles), 5 (open squares), 50
(open circles), 100 ¬µm (open triangles) l-arginine. titration with
1 mm l-arginine was very similar to that with 100 ¬µm l-arginine.
lines are the hyperbolic fits to the enos controls.

effects of l-arginine and bh4 on the cyanide binding to
enos. equilibrium binding of cyanide to the baculovirusexpressed enos [bh4(+) enos] and e. coli-expressed
enos [bh4(-) enos] were conducted using a444-398 nm and
a444-400 nm as indices, respectively. these titrations were
performed at l-arginine concentrations ranging from 0 to 1
mm. for both enos controls, the binding isotherms were
hyperbolic and the kd‚Äôs determined, 9.6 and 5.6 mm,
respectively, are similar (figure 3). increasing the l-arginine
concentration did not change the end point of the titration
using either enos sample indicating that there is no
overlapping in binding domain between l-arginine and
cyanide. however, the apparent kd in the e. coli sample
appears to be more sensitive to the l-arginine concentration
than that of the baculovirus-expressed sample. a 170 and
57% increase in kd was found for these two enos samples,
respectively, indicating that the presence of bh4 attenuated
the effect of l-arginine on cyanide binding.
the kinetics of binding of cyanide for the baculovirusexpressed enos was also performed in the absence and
presence of 25 ¬µm l-arginine using the stopped-flow

biochemistry, vol. 39, no. 31, 2000 9377

technique. without l-arginine, the cyanide binding is accurately monoexponential under pseudo-first-order conditions
(figure 4a). the secondary plot of kobs vs ligand concentrations is linear and yields a second-order on rate constant of
7.6 √ó 102 m-1 s-1 from the slope and an off rate constant
of 11.5 s-1 from the intercept (figure 4a, inset). these values
give a calculated kd of 15 mm, similar to that obtained from
equilibrium binding measurements (table 2). in the presence
of 25 ¬µm l-arginine, cyanide binding slowed substantially
although still appeared to be monoexponential (figure 4b).
the apparent kon and koff determined from the secondary plot
(figure 4b, inset) are 1.17 m-1 s-1 and 0.6 s-1, respectively,
giving a calculated kd of 0.5 m, more than 30 times higher
than the l-arginine-free enos (figure 4b and table 2). this
kd value is also very different from that obtained by the
equilibrium titration method (figure 3a and table 2). this
marked contradiction of kd values obtained by equilibrium
titration and straight secondary plot analysis for the kinetic
binding data demands a critical mechanistic assessment.
the competition model (model a in scheme 1) used for
imidazole binding does not apply to cyanide binding kinetics.
first of all, the binding equilibrium measurements, particularly for the bh4(+) enos, are not sensitive to l-arginine.
although the apparent kd for the bh4(-) enos was
increased with increasing l-arginine level, the kd value
reaches plateau at 15 mm (figure 3). furthermore, the end
point of ferric heme cyanide complex formation in equilibrium binding measurements remained practically constant
regardless of the l-arginine concentration (figure 3). to
interpret these data, we propose that binding of l-arginine
impedes the cyanide ligand in both the on and off directions,
but there is no binding domain overlap with the l-arginine
binding site. thus cn- binding to the enos heme will show
the same final level of binding complex either with or without
l-arginine in the binding system. this simple obstruction
model shown in scheme 1 (model b) successfully simulated
the cyanide binding data in the presence of l-arginine (solid
lines in figure 4b) by decreasing the values of k2 and k-2
(600 m-1 s-1 and 11.0 s-1, respectively) to k3 and k-3 (2.0
m-1 s-1 and 0.06 s-1, respectively) when l-arginine is
introduced (table 2). these are ‚àº300- and ‚àº180-fold
changes, respectively.
the cyanide binding kinetics of e. coli-expressed enos
[bh4(-)] are very similar to those of the baculovirusexpressed enos [bh4(+)]. the control experiments without
l-arginine treatment also exhibit homogeneous kinetic behavior (figure 5a) with a linear dependence of kobs on
cyanide concentrations (figure 5a, inset). the second-order
association rate constant is 1.8 √ó 103 m-1 s-1, and the
dissociation rate constant is 22 s-1, leading to a kd of 12
mm. this calculated kd is also close to that obtained from
an optical equilibrium titration study (figure 3 and table
2). with 50 ¬µm l-arginine present, the cyanide binding
kinetics became clearly biphasic (figure 5b). the fast phase
that contributed ‚àº10-20% of the total observed change had
a rate close to that of the untreated enos, whereas the
dominant slow-phase showed a greatly decreased rate. the
secondary plot of kobs for the slow phase and cyanide
concentration was linear and yielded an apparent kon of 1.36
m-1 s-1 and an apparent koff of 1.4 s-1 (figure 5b, inset).
the calculated kd is thus 1.03 m, about 85-fold higher than
that obtained from enos binding kinetics without l-arginine

(12 mm), and is also much larger than that obtained from
static titration methods (15.2 mm) (figure 3b and table 2).
to resolve the apparent contradiction, computer simulations based on model b was again conducted and successfully
fit the observed kinetic data of bh4(-) enos, both the
biphasic behavior and the observed rates. in the absence of
l-arginine, the values for k2 and k-2 obtained by direct
exponential fits (1.8 √ó 103 m-1 s-1 and 22 s-1, respectively)
match closely those obtained by optimal simulation (2.0 √ó
103 m-1 s-1 and 22 s-1, respectively) (table 2). in the
presence of l-arginine, the optimal values for k3 and k-3 (5.0
m-1 s-1 and 0.2 s-1, respectively) are ‚àº400 and 110 times
those of k2 and k-2, respectively, but the calculated kd based
on simulations, 40 mm, is much closer to that obtained from

equilibrium titration (15.2 mm) than that obtained from
secondary plot analysis (1.03 m). these results strongly
indicate that l-arginine also decreases the ‚Äúon‚Äù and ‚Äúoff‚Äù
rate of cyanide binding to bh4(-) enos via an obstruction
mechanism. further, the biphasic kinetics (figure 5b) are
not due to heme heterogeneity but are simply the consequence of two populations of enos molecules that are either
l-arginine-free or bound. the l-arginine-free enos molecules are proposed to bind cyanide with a nonobstructed
rate (the fast phase in figure 5b). apparently l-arginine, at
50 ¬µm, does not saturate all binding sites in bh4(-) enos.
this implication of a lower l-arginine affinity in bh4(-)
enos than bh4(+) enos also supports the notion that bh4
enhances l-arginine binding, corroborating the results of

static titration of cyanide binding (figure 3, panel a vs panel
b).
to evaluate the effect of l-arginine concentration, cyanide
binding kinetics was further determined under another set
of conditions. bh4(+) enos (figure 6a) or bh4(-) enos
(figure 6b) were each reacted with a mixture containing 100
mm cyanide and varying amounts of l-arginine, ranging from
0 to 2.5 mm, in the stopped-flow apparatus. multiphasic
kinetics are observed for both enos samples under the same
experimental conditions (figure 6). the kinetic traces
obtained using baculovirus-expressed enos can be fit by
two exponentials, but the data on bacterial enos sample
cannot be fit similarly because the absorbance changes
change directions during the binding process (e.g., see the
bimodal kinetic data obtained for reactions with 25 ¬µm
l-arginine shown in figure 6b). it is noted that the total
observed changes at a442 nm due to cyanide binding is almost
independent of l-arginine concentration. the overall effect
of l-arginine is a concentration-dependent change in the
proportions of the fast and slow components. with an
apparent shift from the fast to slow component with
increasing levels of l-arginine in the reaction.
computer simulations based on model b were carried out
to test its validity in interpreting the data of figure 6. to
our delight, the same set of parameter values used in fitting
the data of figures 4 and 5 also successfully simulate the
multiphasic kinetic data in figure 6. the simulations were
not only remarkable in providing very similar rates and extent
but also predicted the changes in the direction of the observed
absorbance change. the agreement gives several important
implications. the higher the concentration of l-arginine, the
more efficient is its obstruction of cyanide binding, a
consequence of faster l-arginine binding. the similar final
level of cyanide binding suggest nonoverlapping binding sites
for l-arginine and cyanide, a result supported by equilibrium
binding data (figure 3). the multiphasic binding kinetics is
not due to heterogeneity of enos because the proportion of
the different phases is regulated by the level of l-arginine.
changes in the direction of absorbance at 442 nm (figure
6b) is a consequence of the difference in the rates of

approach to equilibrium for l-arginine and cyanide and also
further supports its lower l-arginine affinity for bh4(-) than
the bh4(+) enos.
it is worth mentioning that the apparent binding rates at
100 mm cyanide and 25 ¬µm l-arginine shown in figure 6
as compared to those in figures 4b and 5b are significantly
larger. this difference in observed rates is the result of
different experimental conditions. in the latter case, the
binding equilibrium of l-arginine was first established before
cyanide addition, whereas in the former case, both ligands
are introduced simultaneously. the obstruction of cyanide
binding shown in figures 4b and 5b appeared to be more
pronounced because l-arginine binding had already reached
equilibrium.
effect of l-arginine and bh4 on the no binding to enos.
under pseudo-first-order conditions, no binding kinetics of
baculovirus-expressed enos is monoexponential (figure
7a). the kon and koff obtained from the secondary plot of
kobs vs no concentration were 3.3 √ó 106 m-1 s-1 and 39
s-1, respectively (figure 7b). in contrast, in the presence of
a saturating amount of l-arginine (50 ¬µm), the kinetics of
no binding became heterogeneous (figure 7b). individual
kinetic traces fit reasonably well to a two-exponential
function with the fast phase contributing about 70% of the
total observed changes. the on and off rate constants for
both phases were analyzed by the secondary plot of kobs vs
no concentrations. for the fast component, a kon of 3.3 √ó
106 m-1 s-1 and a koff of 35 s-1 were estimated, and a kd of
10.6 ¬µm was obtained (figure 7c). these three values are
very close to those obtained for the control (zero l-arginine).
similar results were obtained at three different l-arginine
concentrations: 12.5, 25, and 50 ¬µm (figure 7c, three
additional symbols). a koff of 1.5 s-1 was similarly obtained
for the slow phase of the reaction containing 25 ¬µm
l-arginine from the secondary plot, but the on rate could
not be determined due to the negative slope (figure 7b,
inset), implying a rather small rate.
these kinetic data are best simulated as a 1:1 mixture with
one heme center showing a standard no binding reaction
and the second heme follows a binding obstruction mecha-

nism by l-arginine. as shown in figure 7b and table 2,
simulations including a fast phase of 50% overall contribution
with a kon of 3 √ó 106 m-1 s-1 and a koff of 33 s-1 and a slow
phase with a kon of 1 √ó 103 m-1 s-1 and a koff of 1.5 s-1
match well with the observed kinetic data (figure 7b). the
calculated kd from the simulations for the fast component
is thus 11 ¬µm, and kd for the slow component is 1.5 mm,
it is not possible to determine the latter from the secondary
plot (figure 7c, inset). this mechanism implies that the two
heme centers in the enos dimer are different and l-arginine
binding reveals subtle differences between these two heme
centers. in contrast to the cyanide binding data, l-arginine
showed a sizable effect on the plateau of the no-enos
complex, while the final level of the enos-cyanide complex
is rather insensitive to the l-arginine concentration. the
amount of no-enos complex formation was verified by
rapid-scan diode array, and it was confirmed that l-arginine
binding significantly changed the binding affinity and thus
the end point of no binding to the ferric heme in both enos
samples (figure 7b).

e. coli-expressed enos (bh4-deficient) also exhibited
homogeneous no binding kinetics (figure 8a) with an estimated kon of 3.4 √ó 106 m-1 s-1 and a koff of 35 s-1 (figure
8c). kd was then calculated to be 10.3 ¬µm. all three values
are similar to those obtained for bh4-abundant enos, indicating lack of an effect from bh4 on no binding to the ferric
heme. on the other hand, pretreatment of enos with 50 ¬µm
l-arginine resulted in biphasic no binding kinetics (figure
8b). the fast phase accounts for 60% of the total observed
optical change at 444 nm and had an association rate constant
of 3.3 √ó 106 m-1 s-1 and a dissociation rate constant of 35
s-1 (figure 8c and table 2). these two values and the calculated kd, 10.6 ¬µm, are very close to the control. the slow
phase that accounted for 40% of the total optical changes
showed a kon of 4.1 √ó 104 m-1 s-1 and a koff of 4.3 s-1 (figure 8c, inset). the on rate constant is 2 orders of magnitude slower than that of the fast phase, but the off rate
constant is decreased by only 1 order of magnitude, thus
leading to a kd of 104 ¬µm, 10 times larger than the fast
phase (table 2).

ligand binding characteristics of  xxxg1579xxx 
similar to the bh4(+) enos, computer simulations
containing a fast phase with 50% overall contribution, a kon
of 2 √ó 106 m-1 s-1 and a koff of 40 s-1, and a slow phase
with a kon of 3 √ó 104 m-1 s-1 and a koff of 6.3 s-1 nicely fit
the observed kinetic data (figure 8b). the calculated kd for
the fast phase is thus 20 ¬µm, and the value for the slow
phase is 210 ¬µm. these kd values are quite close to those
values calculated from the ratio of the observed on and off
rate constants obtained directly from the secondary plot
(table 2).
thus, bh4 did not show a significant effect on the no
binding to enos, as reflected by the lack of changes of the
rate constants of the plain enos samples and the fast phase
component of l-arginine-treated enos either bh4(-) or
bh4(+) (table 2). however, the slow phase component of
the bh4(+) enos appears to be more sensitive to l-arginine
binding than that of bh4(-) enos (table 2).
again, in the presence of l-arginine, the final level of noferric nos is dependent on the no concentration and failed
to plateau at no concentrations that saturated the control
enos. this indication of a shift of no affinity in the slow
component was further confirmed by rapid-scan diode array
stopped-flow which showed that l-arginine indeed changed
the affinity of the no for both enos preparations (data not
shown).
discussion
we have prepared enos with a full complement of heme,
fad, and fmn. by replenishing hemin and sepiapterin
during cell growth, the bh4 content can be raised to 0.7.
with this enos preparation, we could undertake the experiments in which the stoichiometry of these cofactors is critical
for data interpretation. to study the ligand binding kinetics,
we need a homogeneous preparation to avoid possible
heterogeneous kinetic data. we accomplished this for the
heme and flavin groups of enos but are still unable to
reconstitute bh4 to a stoichiometric level. with stoichiometric amounts of heme, it is possible to define the heme
extinction coefficient and thus the absorption coefficient of
different ligand-heme complexes. this facilitates assessing
the expected end point of binding equilibrium in static
titrations and stopped-flow kinetic measurements. this will
be critical for future characterization of electron-transfer
mechanism. to evaluate the effect of bh4, we chose to
compare bh4-deficient e. coli-expressed enos and bh4abundant enos (either baculovirus-expressed enos or e.
coli-expressed enos reconstituted with bh4), rather than
adding excess exogenous bh4, thus minimizing two potential
problems:
(i) we may treat bh4 as a cofactor if we have only proteinbound bh4. with excess exogenous bh4, this component
will serve dual roles, both as a ligand and a cofactor. most
of our experiments to evaluate the effect of l-arginine on
small heme ligand binding already have two ligands in the
binding system. introducing another free ligand, bh4, will
further complicate data analysis.
(ii) free bh4 molecules autoxidize rapidly in the buffer
systems commonly used for nos samples (33; and our
unpublished data). with excess exogenous bh4, we face a
heterogeneous population of biopterin present at different
redox states with the concentration of bh4 at each redox
state constantly changing during the experiments.

biochemistry, vol. 39, no. 31, 2000 9381

to control the autoxidation of bh4 and to achieve a
homogeneous system for the binding reaction, we decided
to use enos samples that are either free of bh4 [bh4(-)
enos] or specifically reconstituted to the enos protein
[bh4(+) enos]. excess exogenous bh4 used to reconstitute
e. coli-expressed enos has been removed by gel filtration.
imidazole and l-arginine binding to enos were demonstrated previously to be mutually exclusive (9). depending
on how the experiments are executed, the kinetic data can
take a very different appearance, as illustrated in figures 1
and 2. the data with simple exponential kinetics was easily
fit by model a (scheme 1) using the previously measured
on and off rate constants for both ligands (9) (figure 1, panels
b and d). kinetic data obtained for bh4(+) and bh4(-)
enos were conspicuously biphasic (figure 2, panels a and
b) but are also fit to model a using the same set of rate
constants that optimally fit the data in figure 1 (lines in
figure 2). our simulations not only validate the simple
competition model but also demonstrate that the influence
of bh4 on the interaction between l-arginine and imidazole
is minimal.
in contrast, l-arginine substantially reduced the rates of
cyanide binding on both the association and dissociation steps
in enos samples whether bh4 was present or not (figures
4-6). this sizable decline in apparent binding rates is not
due to the crowding of the ligand access channel, because
binding of cyanide is not influenced by weakly associated,
but bulkier, type ii ligands such as histamine and nicotinic
acid (data not shown). the simple obstruction model listed
in scheme 1, model b successfully simulated all our cyanide
binding data (compare figures 4-6) by decreasing the values
of k2 and k-2 to k3 and k-3 when l-arginine is present. the
modeling closely simulates the observed rates, extent, and
also the multiphasic kinetics with opposite absorbance
changes as manifested by the data (figure 6b, see the data
for 25 and 50 ¬µm l-arginine). because the cyanide binding
kinetics was measured at one fixed l-arginine concentration
(figures 4 and 5) or increasing levels of l-arginine (figure
6), a single set of values capable of fitting all the kinetic
data attest to the correctness of the model.
this obstruction model is also coincident with the recent
3-d structure of the enos oxygenase domain (6, 7),
containing an l-arginine sitting right on top of the heme
moiety and able to impede cyanide ligation to and dissociation from the heme iron. the distance between the arginino
nitrogen and the heme iron defined by x-ray crystallography
and endor study, 4.05 √• (34), is larger than the space
required for a cyanide ligand, ‚àº3 √•. (‚àº1.9 √• between fe
and c and ‚àº1.1 √• for the ctn bond) (35). on the other
hand, with cyanide bound to the heme iron should not
influence the l-arginine binding kinetics, as corroborated by
the same rate constants, k1 and k-1, used in scheme 1, eq
b4.
in the presence of l-arginine, both kinetics of imidazole
and cyanide binding show an initial jump of binding to
bh4(-) enos as compared to bh4(+) enos (figure 2,
panels b vs a, and figure 5b vs figure 4b). this difference
is due to the lower l-arginine binding affinity for bh4(-)
enos than to bh4(+) enos, so the former has a larger fast
phase to the l-arginine-free enos protein. to simulate the
kinetics properly, a kd value of ‚àº5.0 ¬µm for l-arginine was
used for bh4(-) enos and 1.0 ¬µm was used for bh4(+)

9382 biochemistry, vol. 39, no. 31, 2000
enos. these results corroborate a previous observation that
bh4 binding enhances the l-arginine binding (36). furthermore, the subtle difference in the equilibrium cyanide binding
between bh4(+) and bh4(-) enos substantiate the effect
of bh4 in enhancing the heme ligand binding. thus, the
heme, bh4, and l-arginine ‚Äútriad‚Äù enhance one another to
achieve a stable and rigid ‚Äúscaffold‚Äù. such rigid orientation
is essential for efficient oxygen activation and no formation
chemistry. the absence of bh4 or l-arginine or both in the
heme distal region results in a ‚Äúwobbling‚Äù heme, leading to
a slow on rate or faster off rate constant for heme ligands.
this concept is supported by x-ray data, which show
extensive direct and indirect hydrogen-bonding interactions
between l-arginine and heme and between heme and bh4
(5-7).
it is noteworthy that in the presence of l-arginine, the
apparent kd calculated from secondary plots, 1.03 and 0.5
m for bh4(-) and bh4(+) enos are substantially larger
than those calculated as k-3/k3 from numerical integration,
i.e., 40 and 30 mm, respectively, and those equilibrium
constants obtained by optical titrations, i.e., 15.2 and 15.1
mm, respectively (table 2). the similar ending points of
the stopped-flow kinetic data shown in figure 6 also indicate
that cyanide binding affinity was little affected by l-arginine.
this discrepancy is not due to the data scatter for the low
values of measured rate of l-arginine-treated enos. the
linearity of the data measured in the presence and absence
of l-arginine is very similar with r2 >0.99. this result
indicates that the apparent kon and koff obtained from the
secondary plot cannot be used to define the ligand affinity
in our binding experiments that involve multiple ligands.
computer simulation or fitting to a reliable mechanistic
model is essential to get optimal values for the rate and
equilibrium constants.
kinetic data of no binding are more complicated. both
bh4(+) and bh4(-) ferric enos exhibited standard homogeneous second-order binding kinetics (figure 7a and 8a).
however, addition of l-arginine appeared to separate each
enos sample into two different populations with one part
remaining insensitive to l-arginine binding but the other part
showing substantially reduced rates. although we succeeded
in interpreting the no binding data using an extended
obstruction model, other binding models might explain the
same data. however, the simple model that l-arginine
binding resulted in a significant ‚Äúpartial obstruction‚Äù of no
binding association and dissociation provides a remarkably
simple interpretation for the l-arginine-insensitive fast binding phase and the l-arginine sensitive slow phase both in
their rates and extent.
the implication for structural differences between the two
heme centers in the nos dimer is not apparent from the
recent x-ray crystallographic data (7). however, our earlier
epr study of the low-spin heme complexes of imidazole
and its analogues clearly showed heterogeneous heme
rhombicity (37). in addition, more than one ferrous hemeco structures are revealed by rr studies (21). the possible
existence of a structural difference between the two heme
centers in enos was only apparent after the introduction of
l-arginine in our kinetic measurements, indicating these
changes are subtle and not disclosed by x-ray crystallography. the significance of this heme perturbation in terms
of catalysis is yet to be defined. the l-arginine effect on

berka and tsai
no binding kinetics corroborates our recent study of the
geminate rebinding of no (38). in the presence of l-arginine,
the multiphasic rebinding of no after the laser flash shifts
to a slower rate as compared to the control and also the
contribution of each phase is changed sizably. it was
proposed that l-arginine binding resulted in a larger activation barrier for those no ligands that escaped out of the heme
pocket to overcome for the reassociation process. such a
kinetic barrier is likely to be the result of the physical location
of the bound l-arginine relative to the heme plane as
disclosed by the x-ray crystallographic data (5-7). such a
barrier should slow both the binding and the dissociation of
no as observed in our stopped-flow measurements.
abu-soud et al. have measured no kinetic binding to the
ferric inos and evaluated the effect of both l-arginine and
bh4 on the no binding (15). their results indicate that
neither bh4 nor l-arginine showed a significant effect. the
rate constants they obtained are comparable with our control
bh4(+) and bh4(-) enos data. the insensitivity to bh4
of no binding to inos is similar to enos. however, the
lack of effect from l-arginine is in sharp contrast to our data.
the structure in the heme pocket that contains the bh4 and
l-arginine groups are essentially superimposable between
enos and inos based on the x-ray data (2, 7). it is not
clear why the no binding kinetics showed a large difference
in l-arginine sensitivity between inos and enos, although
the experiments were carried out at somewhat different
conditions. the main difference is that abu-soud et al. used
an excess exogenous bh4 to evaluate the bh4 effect, thus
bh4 was both a ligand and a cofactor (15). recent geminate
rebinding kinetics between no and ferric  xxxg1577xxx  also showed
monophasic binding kinetics and no dependence on either
l-arginine or bh4 (18). although the binding affinity and
kinetics of l-arginine-free nos are very similar for all three
isoforms (15, 18; and this study), l-arginine only caused
significant changes in the no binding kinetic behavior of
enos. this is another selective effect observed so far for
this substrate.
although no and cyanide are isoelectronic and similar
in molecular size, their binding kinetics and the response to
l-arginine are quite different. the substantially reduced
affinity for heme of anionic cyanide than no is likely be
the result of the stronger negative trans effect from the
thiolate heme ligand. this additional charge probably also
plays a role in the stronger obstruction in heme binding by
l-arginine as the electrostatic interaction between the cationic
arginino headgroup and the cyanide anion should be much
stronger than that with no, thus leading to slower kon and
koff for cyanide. it is not clear why l-arginine distinguished
the two heme populations in the enos-no complex but
not in the cyanide-heme complex. the ability of no but
not cyanide to adopt either a linear (sp hybridization) or bent
(sp2 hybridization) conformation may explain its different
sensitivity to the l-arginine binding than cyanide. further
characterization is needed to test this proposal.
in summary, an enos preparation with a full complement
of heme and flavins was used to evaluate the intricate
interactions among the heme, l-arginine, and bh4 triad using
three small heme ligands; each exhibited distinctive binding
behavior to enos. this study is first in which bh4 was
treated solely as a cofactor and not a ligand. in addition, for
the first time, discrete mechanistic models were developed

ligand binding characteristics of  xxxg1579xxx 
to successfully interpret the binding mechanism. imidazole
is strictly competitive with l-arginine, but the binding of
cyanide and no are very differently affected by l-arginine.
an obstruction model was successfully applied to fit all the
kinetic data. bh4 showed only an indirect effect by strengthening the ‚Äútriad‚Äù scaffolding. potential pitfalls in analyzing
kinetic data derived from multiple ligand interactions and
using a secondary plot between the kobs and ligand concentrations are well-exemplified by the cyanide binding kinetics.
it is thus critical to resolve the ligand binding mechanism
using computer modeling. implication of two different heme
centers in the enos dimer was also provided by the no
binding data, which is in sharp contrast with other nos
isozymes. this subtle difference has yet to be revealed by
the x-ray crystallography.
