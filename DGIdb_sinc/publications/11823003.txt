abstract
 xxxd3456xxx , a reversible peripheral inhibitor of cholinesterases accelerates methanesulfonylation of drosophila melanogaster wild type and w359l mutant. the kinetic evaluation
of the process was performed in a step-by-step analysis. the second order overall sulfonylation rate constants, determined from classical residual activity measurements, were used in
the subsequent analysis of progress curves. the latter were obtained by measuring the
hydrolysis of acetylthiocholine in a complex reaction system of enzyme, substrate, irreversible and reversible inhibitor. the underlying kinetic mechanisms, from such a complex
data, could only be untangled by targeted inspection and successive incorporation of reaction
steps for which experimental evidence existed. the study showed that the peripheral ligand
 xxxd3456xxx , by binding at the entrance into the active site of the two investigated
enzymes (goličnik et al., biochemistry 40 (2001) 1214), enhances the affinity for small
methanesulfonylfluoride, rather to speeding up the formation of a stable covalent enzyme-inhibitor complex. the specific arrangements at the rim of the active site of each individual

1. introduction
the catalytic mechanism and inhibition of ches have been extensively investigated [1] during the past decades. recently, the crystal structure determination of
aches from vertebrates and from drosophila melanogaster [2–5] revealed the
active site, :20 a, deep inside the core of the molecule, at the bottom of a narrow
gorge. it seems that such penetrated catalytic site is responsible for their peculiar
kinetic behavior. all ches, either native or various specifically mutated enzymes,
exhibit deviations from michaelis–menten hyperbolic kinetics. while moderate
positive homotropic pseudo-cooperativity at intermediate substrate concentrations
is present only in certain enzymes, the inhibition by excess substrate is seldom
missing [6– 8]. several kinetic models were proposed to describe non michaelis–
menten behavior of ches [9,10], but they were able only to explain one deviation.
recently, a six parameter kinetic model valid for all ches was introduced [11]. it
can describe both mentioned deviations and by an appropriate extension, also the
data in the presence of various reversible or irreversible active site directed
inhibitors [7,12– 14]. it was also found that  xxxd3456xxx  (tc), an inhibitor,
whose shape and size prevent the interaction with the active site at the bottom of
the gorge, can enhance the substrate hydrolysis at high substrate concentrations in
the case of drosophila w359l ache mutant [14]. this paradox has been explained
as inhibition, less effective than the substrate inhibition itself.
to obtain further information on the behavior of relatively narrow active site
gorge in drosophila ache (50% less space as in torpedo enzyme [5]) we investigated the methanesulfonylation of wild type dmache and the w359l mutant in
the absence and presence of tc. methanesulfonylfluoride (msf), a poweful
irreversible anticholinesterase agent, sulfonylates insect ache with faster rates than
vertebrate enzymes or bches [15–17]. it is also known that the action of this tiny
sulfonate on vertebrate aches is accelerated by active site directed inhibitors like
 xxxd3337xxx  and  xxxd1820xxx  [16] but tc is an inhibitor of methanesulfonylation [18]. the fact, that tc can also activate w359l dmache, lead us to
investigate its action on the methanesulfonylation of wild type dmache and the
w359l mutant. we have performed the experiments, where the substrate hydrolysis
was followed in the presence of two inhibitors, tc and msf. such experiments
represent a very complex system, and the obtained data require sophisticated
step-by-step kinetic analysis [19]. in the present paper, a two level description of the
underlying events is given: (i) a logical explanation based on thorough inspection of
raw experimental data and (ii) a profound successive kinetic analysis using modern
mathematical modelling principles.

2. materials and methods

2.1. chemicals
acetylthiocholine (atch) and 5,5%-dithio-bis-nitrobenzoic acid (dtnb) were
purchased from sigma chemicals co. (st. louis, usa),  xxxd3456xxx  chloride
(tc) from fluka chemie ag (buchs, switzerland) and methanesulfonylfluoride
(msf) was a product of serva biochemica (heidelberg, germany). msf stock
solution was prepared in spectroquality acetone. other substances were reagent
grade. all experiments were done at 25 °c in 25 mm sodium phosphate buffer with
ph 7.0.

2.2. source of enzymes
truncated cdna encoding soluble ache of d. melanogaster was expressed with
the baculovirus system [20]. secreted enzymes were purified and stabilized with 1
mg/ml bsa according to estrada-mondaca and fournier [21]. the titration of the
enzyme’s active sites was carried out using 7-(methylethoxyphosphinyloxy)-1methylquinolinium iodide (mepq) synthesized as described by levy and ashani
[22]. residue numbering follows that of the precursor [23].

2.3. kinetic experiments
2.3.1. dilution experiments
the time course of irreversible ache inhibition by methanesulfonylfluoride was
determined by measuring residual enzyme activity after various times of incubation
in the absence and presence of tc, according to the dilution method of aldridge
[24]. the enzyme, in the presence of seven tc concentrations (0–500 mm), was
incubated for 0.5– 20 min (eight time points on the average) with five different msf
concentrations (62.5– 750 mm). after a dilution of 300 times, the remaining enzyme
activity was determined spectrophotometrically according to ellman et al. [25].
each measurement was repeated at least twice to obtain : 560 data points for the
wild type enzyme and the w359l mutant, respectively. we added in the incubation
mixture 5% of acetone.
2.3.2. progress cur6e measurements
in other different experiments, sulfonylation was followed on a stopped-flow
apparatus in order to get important diagnostic information on the early stages of
this process. aliquots of two solutions, one containing only the enzyme and the
other one atch, tc, dtnb, various concentrations of msf and 6% of acetone
were mixed together in the mixing chamber of the apparatus. the absorbance of the
reaction mixture was recorded spectrophotometrically [25] at 412 nm. the measurements were performed in the presence of 1 mm substrate and with final msf
concentrations between 5.5 and 60 mm. the concentration of dtnb was 1 mm.
in order to avoid possible product modulation, we stopped the measurement when
: 60 mm concentration of the product was formed.

scheme 1.

2.4. data analysis
2.4.1. dilution experiments
the sulfonylation of aches by msf may be represented by scheme 1 [16],
where e is free enzyme, emsf represents a reversible complex between the enzyme
and msf and e* is the inactivated enzyme. ki is the equilibrium constant and k2
is the first order sulfonylation rate constant. it has been shown that scheme 1 gives
the following equation [16]:
ln

 

[e]t
k2·[msf]·t
=−
[e]0
[msf] +ki

(1)

where [e]0 is the total enzyme concentration and [e]t is the remaining enzyme
concentration at any time. due to the relatively rapid sulfonylation of drosophila
ache in the investigated msf concentration range, sulfonylation appeared as a
single step process. since higher msf concentrations are technically not applicable
we used, for the analysis, the following simplified reaction scheme which permits
the same flux through the step as the full mechanism [26] as in scheme 2, where ks
is the second order sulfonylation rate constant. in this case, eq. (1) also simplifies:
ln

 

[e]t
= −ks·[msf]·t
[e]0

(2)

to describe the methanesulfonylation of dmache in the presence of tc, the
appropriate steps should be added in the reaction scheme. according to previously
collected kinetic data [14], the binding of one tc molecule to the wild type
dmache can be detected, but two molecules of tc bind to the w359l mutant.
therefore, we constructed a general kinetic scheme for the methanesulfonylation of
dmache in the presence of tc, which foresees a double successive tc binding as
in scheme 3 where i represents tc.
according to this scheme, we derived the equation for residual activity, assuming
instantaneous establishment of equilibria that involve the binding of tc and slow
sulfonylation of all enzyme species. under the conditions where [msf], [i] [e] the
following equation for residual activity was obtained:
[e]t =[e]0·e − ks[msf]st

scheme 3.

the kinetic parameters ks, p and q (scheme 3) were determined by fitting eq. (3)
simultaneously to all experimental data obtained in dilution experiments, with each
individual tested enzyme (:560 data points, see section 2). k3 and k7 were set as
previously evaluated [14] (for values see table 1).

2.4.2. progress cur6es measurements
it should be emphasized that in these experiments the enzyme in the reaction
vessel can react with the substrate (atch), tc and msf. the kinetic representation of such a complex reaction system must include all these interactions, but it
should also be in accordance with the data from the precedent dilution experiments.
we included therefore, the interaction of msf with all non-acylated enzyme
species. we also included fast forming reversible msf complexes with these species,
since the rapid stopped-flow technique provided us the relevant information on
these steps (scheme 4).

in this scheme, m denotes msf, the symbol ea stands for acylated enzyme,
while s, p1 and p2 are acetylthiocholine, thiocholine and acetate, respectively.
the progress curve equation valid for this reaction scheme was derived essentially
as described previously [27], again assuming that concentrations of msf and tc
were several grades of magnitude higher than the enzyme concentration (the
derivation is given in appendix a).

experimental curves, setting previously determined parameters as constants (table

it follows from dilution experiments and scheme 4 that ks = k2/k8, pks =  xxxg1234xxx /k10
and qks =jk2/k12. so, instead of ten, we had to evaluate only seven missing
parameters (k9, k11, k2, gk2,  xxxg1234xxx ,  xxxd1920xxx , jk2) from progress curves data.
all calculations were performed on ibm-pc compatible computer running
linux, using c translation of non-linear regression program, originaly written by
duggleby [28].

3. results
dilution experiments are the basic approach for the determination of acylation rate
constants of irreversible cholinesterases’ inhibitors. briefly, initial rates measured at
various preincubation times yield pseudo first order rate constants which upon
plotting vs. msf concentration give second order sulfonylation rate constant.
subsequently, the effect of various tc concentrations on this second-order sulfonyl-

mutant of d. melanogaster aches in the absence and presence of  xxxd3456xxx  and methanesulfonylfluoride. measurements were performed at 1 mm substrate concentration in the presence of 3% acetone.
in panels a and c the concentrations of  xxxd3456xxx  are 0, in panels b and d are 0.2 mm.

ation rate constant is inspected. we, however, performed a simultaneous analysis of
all residual activity data using equation with three independent variables: time, [msf]
and [tc] (eq. (3)). for clarity, only final dependence, the second order sulfonylation
rate constants vs. tc concentration, is simulated in fig. 1, according to the evaluated
parameters ks, p and q. although the curves for both studied enzymes describe
acceleration of methanesufonylation, one can clearly distinguish different shapes of
the two curves. for wt dmache, it shows a hyperbolic increase of second order
overall sulfonylation rate constant (ks in scheme 2) as a function of tc concentration.
such a pattern points to a simple michaelis–menten like saturation mechanism. it
should be emphasized that the shape of hyperbolic curve provides the information
for the high affinity binding of only one tc molecule (k3) and consequently, the
analysis yields only the corresponding parameters (see table 1, parameters denoted
with ‘– ’ were omitted). in contrast, the acceleration of methanesulfonylation in the
w359l mutant follows a sigmoidal curve, which can only be explained by multiple
binding of tc (k3, k7). therefore, we have included in the analysis the successive
binding of two tc molecules (scheme 3).

of dmache are presented in fig. 2. a targeted inspection of the curves for the two
enzymes reveals three very important differences in the effect of tc on the time course
of product formation during the sulfonylation. (i) the initial slopes of the curves in
panels a and b, representing wt dmache are msf independent, but the progress
curves for the w359l mutant (panels c and d) show clear msf dependence of initial
slopes. (ii) the next clearly visible characteristic of progress curves is the opposite
effect of tc on the two enzymes, that can be recognized from the slope of the
uppermost lines (the curves in the absence of msf are linear). while tc inhibits wt
dmache, it increases the initial rate of the w359l mutant. (iii) finally, the
sulfonylation is more accelerated by tc in the wt enzyme, but goes faster in the
w359l mutant in the absence of tc. these can be seen by comparing the curvatures
of the corresponding progress curves (faster sulfonylation, more concave progress
curves) and is reflected by the values of the kinetic parameters in table 1.

4. discussion
methanesulfonylation and the influence of various anti-cholinesterase agents on
this process have been extensively studied with various cholinesterases. usually, the
dilution method proposed by aldridge [24] which excludes the interference of the
substrate was used to determine the reversible michaelis–menten complex formation
and irreversible sulfonylation rate constant. with vertebrate aches as well as with
bches, the acceleration of methanesulfonylation by various active site-directed
ligands is due to increased affinity of the enzyme for a small inhibitor rather to
speeding up the formation of a stable covalent enzyme-inhibitor complex [16]. in
drosophila ache, however, dilution experiments do not distinguish the two steps in
the reaction. our data agree completely with krupka’s results [15] for ache from
the brain of the house fly: very low affinity of msf for these enzymes and rather
fast sulfonylation rate do not permit to use saturating msf concentration.
surprisingly, tc turned to be an accelerator rather an inhibitor of methanesulfonylation in the wt enzyme and the biphasic activation is seen in the w359l mutant
(fig. 1). to be able to explain these findings, we measured the simultaneous influence
of msf and tc on the hydrolysis of atch by both enzymes. indeed, these
experiments also confirmed a very low affinity of the wt enzyme for msf,
characterized by non-dependent initial rates in fig. 2, panels a, b [29]. on the other
hand, the data for the w359l mutant show msf dependent initial rates, allowing
us to discriminate two steps in the process of sulfonylation: rapid initial complex
formation is followed by slow irreversible inactivation. of course, the enlargement
of the kinetic model required for the analysis is such, that several sets of parameters
apply unless some are fixed. this is reasonable, since scheme 4 includes reaction
intermediates which theoretically appear as the reaction system gets more and more
complex. therefore, in the analysis we fixed those parameters that we had determined
in the analysis of dilution measurements but also in an independent study in the
absence of msf [14]. as mentioned in section 2.4, there were seven parameters to
be evaluated from progress curves. according to the conclusions based on the

154

m. goličnik et al. / chemico-biological interactions 139 (2002) 145–157

inspection of the data in fig. 1 (section 3), only six parameters for the wt enzyme
and five for the w359l mutant remained to be determined. unfortunately, our
progress curves for the wt enzyme could only provide the information for two
parameters and for the w359l mutant four of five. the experiments in the
presence of the substrate do not discriminate k2 and k8 (scheme 4), because the
high substrate affinities of free enzymes prevent their accumulation (see the values
of k1). the dissociation constants for the initial binding of msf to the wt enzyme
also cannot be evaluated as the initial rates are msf independent. however, from
the values of dissociation constants for the binding of msf to the w359l mutant
and the corresponding first order sulfonylation rate constants we can anticipate
that k8 is of the same order as k9, k10 or k12. in this case it is evident that with
dilution experiments it is technically impossible to evaluate k8. we can speculate
that a similar situation happens when the substrate reacts with the enzyme: high
affinity at the modulation site masks low affinity formation of the michaelismenten complex. additionally, a continuous affinity gradient in the main catalytic
pathway results kinetically in an overall second order acylation step (ki ) in scheme
4.
we have shown that by using rapid kinetic equipment and in the presence of tc
it is possible to follow early stages in methanesulfonylation of w359l drosophila
ache. the pattern of progress curves revealed the existence of an initial addition
complex which gradually accumulates with the rising msf concentrations or by the
addition of reversible peripheral ligand tc. an appropriate analysis enabled us to
evaluate dissociation constants for enzyme–msf complexes but unfortunately,
these study and all our previous attempts did not provide direct evidence for the
existence of an analogous enzyme-substrate complex (es).
at the end, an important virtual discrepancy should be discussed. from our
experimental data it is evident that methanesulfonylation is accelerated in both
tested enzymes (fig. 1), but the activity towards atch is only increased in the
w359l mutant (uppermost lines in fig. 2 and see also ref. [14]). the explanation
most probably lays in the size of the ligand entering the gorge of various
dmaches. small ligands are enhanced in their action under the influence of
peripheral inhibitors and the ligands which exceed a certain size are hindered. the
actual sign of the effect, however, depends upon specific arrangements at the rim of
the active site of each individual enzyme. a similar conclusion can be drawn from
the action of triton x-100, another peripheral inhibitor of wt drosophila ache:
small carbamates and organophosphates are accelerated in their action but the
large are inhibited [30].
