we examined the effects of a variety of ligands/activators of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor ( xxxg1805xxx ) on the
expression of the superoxide scavenger enzyme, cu2ⴙ,zn2ⴙ-superoxide dismutase (cuzn-sod), and the superoxide generating enzyme  xxxd3210xxx  (reduced form) (nadph) oxidase in primary cultures of human
umbilical vein endothelial cells (huvec) and human aorta endothelial cells (haec). our data show that 3 types of ppars,
 xxxg1805xxx ␣,  xxxg1805xxx ␤/␦/ xxxg1806xxx , and  xxxg1805xxx ␥ are expressed in endothelial cells.  xxxd331xxx , which is a ligand/activator for  xxxg1805xxx ␣,
increased the cuzn-sod gene expression and protein levels in endothelial cells. troglitazone and pioglitazone, which are
ligands/activators for  xxxg1805xxx ␥, also induced  xxxg1805xxx ␣ gene and protein expression and increased cuzn-sod gene expression and
protein levels in addition to increasing  xxxg1805xxx ␥ gene and protein expression in endothelial cells. moreover, with treatment of
monounsaturated and polyunsaturated  xxxd2154xxx  (pufa), the cuzn-sod mrna levels were positively correlated with  xxxg1805xxx ␣
mrna levels (r ⴝ .872, p < .0001) in primary endothelial cells. in addition, the phorbol  xxxd2681xxx  acetate (pma)-stimulated or
pma-nonstimulated 22-kd a-subunit (p22phox) mrna levels and 47-kd a-subunit ( xxxg1508xxx ) protein levels in nadph oxidase
were decreased by treatment with  xxxg1805xxx ␣ and  xxxg1805xxx ␥ ligands/activators. these results suggest that  xxxg1805xxx ␣ and  xxxg1805xxx ␥ gene
and protein expression in endothelial cells may play a physiologic role as radical scavengers, although the details of these
mechanisms remain to be established.

t

he peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor
( xxxg1805xxx ) is a member of the steroid  xxxg1603xxx 
superfamily.1 three types of ppars have been described in
rodents, humans, and amphibians:  xxxg1805xxx ␣,  xxxg1806xxx  (also
called  xxxg1805xxx ␤ or  xxxg1805xxx ␦), and  xxxg1805xxx ␥.  xxxg1805xxx ␣ has been
reported to be expressed in the liver, retina, digestive mucosa, proximal tubules of kidney, heart, muscle, and brown
adipose tissue.2 however,  xxxg1805xxx ␤/␦/ xxxg1806xxx  is ubiquitously
expressed.3  xxxg1805xxx ␤ has been identified in amphibians,
 xxxg1805xxx ␦ was isolated in mice, and  xxxg1806xxx  was identified in
mammals.  xxxg1805xxx ␥ is a transcription factor selectively expressed in adipose tissues4 and seems to be associated with
differentiation of adipocytes.
ppars are differentially activated by a variety of  xxxd2154xxx .
 xxxg1805xxx ␣ is activated by polyunsaturated  xxxd2154xxx  (pufa),
such as  xxxd2318xxx  (epa), and a variety of hypolipidemic fibrates such as  xxxd331xxx ,5  xxxd1724xxx ,  xxxd2096xxx ,6
and gemfibrozil.7  xxxg1805xxx ␥ is activated by 15-deoxy-delta 12,
delta 14 prostaglandin j2 (pgj2)8,9 and a variety of hypoglycemic thiazolidinediones, such as troglitazone,10 and pioglitazone.11 however,  xxxg1805xxx ␤/␦/ xxxg1806xxx -selective ligands have not
yet been identified.

recently, it has been reported that  xxxg1805xxx ␣ affects the duration of inflammation induced by leukotriene b4/arachidonic
acid.12 moreover, it has been reported that  xxxg1805xxx ␥ is expressed
at high levels in peritoneal macrophages.13 these findings
suggest that  xxxg1805xxx ␣ and  xxxg1805xxx ␥ may play a role in atherosclerotic and inflammatory events, as well as in pathophysiologic
alterations of lipid and glucose metabolisms.
atherosclerosis and inflammation involve a variety of
cells including endothelial cells, vascular smooth muscle
cells, monocytes, neutrophils, lymphocytes, and platelets.
among these, endothelial cells play a crucial role in the
regulation of platelet function, coagulation, and vascular
tone, and they initiate the inflammatory response. interestingly, endothelial dysfunction occurs at an incipient stage of
atherosclerosis, particularly when cardiovascular risk factors
such as hyperlipidemia, hypertension, and diabetes are
present. recently, we reported that  xxxg1805xxx ␣ is expressed in
endothelial cells and regulated by hormones, such as dexamethasone and insulin.14 moreover, we have found that
 xxxg1805xxx ␣ is associated with the expression of cu2⫹,zn2⫹superoxide dismutase (cuzn-sod),15 which scavenges reactive oxygen species (ros), which can be produced by
 xxxd3210xxx  (reduced form)

the purpose of this study was to explore the possibility that
the enzyme mrna and protein levels of cuzn-sod or
nadph oxidase may change in response to the ligands/activators for  xxxg1805xxx ␣ and  xxxg1805xxx ␥ in endothelial cells.
materials and methods
primary cultures of human umbilical vein endothelial cells
(huvec) (lot #31091) and primary cultures of human hepatocytes

(huh) (lot #ri-3716) were purchased from cell systems (kirkland,
wa). in addition, human aorta endothelial cells (haec) were obtained
from 3 commercial sources (lot #ri-375, cell systems; lot #14319 and
lot #6f0741, clonetics, san diego, ca). the endothelial cells were
checked for their ability to produce factor viii-related antigen by
indirect immunofluorescence microscopy, and all cells were identified
as endothelial cells. cell cultures were maintained in 25-cm2 flasks in
a commercial medium: cs-4zo-500, dainippon pharmaceutical, supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (fbs), hepes (15 mmol/l),
acidic-fibroblast growth factor (fgf), and heparin in an atmosphere of
5% co2 and 95% air at 37°c. some huvec were also incubated
without fbs. at confluence, the cell population was divided after
detachment from the flasks with 0.24% edta. the medium was
changed twice weekly. most of cultures were used within 3 weeks, at
the third to fifth passage. the tissue samples were immediately frozen
in liquid nitrogen and were stored at ⫺80°c until extraction of total
rna.

cell treatments
 xxxd2777xxx  (oa) (c18:1, ␻-9),  xxxd208xxx  (aa) ( xxxd208xxx , ␻-6),
linoleic acid (la) (c18:2, ␻-6), epa (c20:5, ␻-3) or docosahexaenoic
acid (dha) (c22:6, ␻-3) was added at a final concentration of 10
␮mol/l, 20 ␮mol/l, 30 ␮mol/l, 100 ␮mol/l, or 300 ␮mol/l, respectively, to the cultured endothelial cells. the medium plus the abovementioned  xxxd2154xxx  was replaced with fresh medium every day. after
the cells were incubated with the above-mentioned  xxxd2154xxx  for 6
hours, 12 hours, 24 hours, and 48 hours, the cells were removed and
assayed for the enzyme activity, mrna, and protein expression. troglitazone or pioglitazone, which was dissolved in 0.1% dimethylsulfoxide (dmso), was used at a final concentration of 10 ␮mol/l or 30
␮mol/l. troglitazone was a generous gift from sankyo, tokyo, japan
and pioglitazone, a generous gift from takeda, osaka, japan.  xxxd331xxx , which was used as sodium- xxxd331xxx , was used at a final
concentration of 2 ␮mol/l, 10 ␮mol/l, or 30 ␮mol/l. sodium- xxxd331xxx  was kindly provided by kissei pharmaceutical, matsumoto,
japan. the cells were incubated with the above-mentioned drugs for 6
hours, 12 hours, and 24 hours.

preliminary experiments had shown that  xxxg1805xxx ␣,  xxxg1805xxx ␤/␦/
 xxxg1806xxx , and  xxxg1805xxx ␥ mrna expression was low, and that accurate

rt-pcr. total rna, which was isolated from huvec or haec
(107 cells) using a commercial kit (isogen; nippon gene, toyama,
japan), was used as a template for dna synthesis using oligo (dt)
primer and a dna cycle kit (geneamp rna pcr kit; perkin
elmer, foster city, ca) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. the rt reaction was performed at 42°c for 15 minutes to
maximize cdna synthesis and was terminated by heating at 99°c
for 5 minutes. the resulting cdna was used as the template for
pcr.
oligonucleotide primers for  xxxg1805xxx ␣ rt-pcr were designed to
amplify partial cdna sequences. the synthetic oligonucleotides were
obtained from nippon flour mills, kanagawa, japan. the primers used
for  xxxg1805xxx ␣ were 5⬘-aga act tca aca tga aca agg tca-3⬘
for the forward primer and 5⬘-gcc agg acg atc tcc aca gca

glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate-dehydrogenase ( xxxg861xxx ) mrna expression was determined as a control.
pcr reactions were performed using the same temperatures for
denaturation (94°c, 30 seconds) and extension (72°c, 90 seconds), but
an annealing temperature was 50°c for 50 seconds. the number of
amplification cycles was 28, 30, 33, 34, and 36 cycles. the pcr
products were separated on a 7.5% polyacrylamide gel (npu, 7.5 type;
atto, tokyo, japan). dna was visualized by ethidium bromide stain-

ing at a concentration of 10 mg/ml. the intensities of the bands that
corresponded with the mrna levels were evaluated using an ultraviolet (uv)-light box imaging system (atto).

dna sequencing
direct sequencing of the rt-pcr products was performed using an
automated sequencer (abi prism 310 genetic analyzer; perkin
elmer, foster city, ca). all dna sequences were confirmed by
reading both dna strands.

transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (millipore, tokyo, japan)
by using semidry blotting. membranes were treated overnight
with tbs-tween/5% dry milk and incubated with goat antihuman ppars, cuzn-sod, and  xxxg1508xxx  antibodies for 1 hour.
antibody against human ppars, cuzn-sod, and  xxxg1508xxx  were

oa treatment in huvec (fig 2).  xxxg1805xxx ␥ mrna expression
was significantly increased by treatment with oa and epa
compared with control (fig 2).  xxxg1805xxx ␥ mrna expression
was significantly decreased by treatment with aa or la
compared with control (fig 2). figure 3 shows the protein

patterns consistent with mrna levels.
 xxxd331xxx  significantly increased cuzn-sod mrna expression (fig 7a and b) and protein levels by western analysis
(fig 7c). troglitazone and pioglitazone also increased  xxxg1805xxx ␣
mrna expression (fig 8) and cuzn-sod mrna levels (fig
9), in addition to  xxxg1805xxx ␥ expression (fig 10) in medium
without fbs during 6 hours.

troglitazone, or pioglitazone attenuated p22phox mrna expression in haec (fig 11). moreover, troglitazone and
 xxxd331xxx  significantly decreased the pma-stimulated
p22phox mrna levels in haec (fig 12). to assess the
 xxxg1508xxx  protein level, which was the other subunit of
nadph oxidase, western blotting was performed (fig 13),
and the results were consistent with the mrna level in
haec (data not shown).

discussion

our present study indicates that in addition to  xxxg1805xxx ␣,14
 xxxg1805xxx ␤/␦/ xxxg1806xxx  and  xxxg1805xxx ␥ might be expressed in endothelial
cells (fig 1). although  xxxg1805xxx ␥ was expressed at lower levels in
endothelial cells (fig 1), expression was induced by the pufas
(fig 2) and thiazolidinediones (fig 10) during 6 hours. these
findings indicate that serum pufas and tiazolidinediones
might have a direct action on endothelial cells, in addition to
adipocytes, which may play a role in glucose and lipid metabolism.
of interest is the observation that both  xxxg1805xxx ␣ and
 xxxg1805xxx ␥ ligands/activators significantly induced cuzn-sod
gene expression in cultured endothelial cells (figs 7 and 9).
recently, we have reported that liver cuzn-sod gene expression shows a significant positive correlation with liver
 xxxg1805xxx ␣ mrna levels in vivo after treatment with  xxxd331xxx , a ligand/activator of  xxxg1805xxx ␣.15 a point to be noted in
our present in vitro study is that  xxxg1805xxx ␣ gene expression
was positively correlated with cuzn-sod gene expression
in the cultured endothelial cells (fig 5). the expression of
cuzn-sod, which scavenges the free radicals, might be
regulated by  xxxg1805xxx . kim et al16 have already cloned the
1.5-kb upstream region of the cuzn-sod gene, demonstrat-

ing peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor response elements (ppre) at ⫺797 region in upstream region of the rat
cuzn-sod gene.  xxxg1805xxx ␣ and  xxxg1805xxx ␥ ligands/activators
might activate the transcription of the cuzn-sod gene
through binding to ppre. in fact, our data indicates that
cuzn-sod expression in cultured endothelial cells is increased by the addition of ligands/activators for  xxxg1805xxx ␣
(figs 3, 6, and 8) and  xxxg1805xxx ␥ (figs 3 and 10) into the culture
medium. reactive oxygen-induced free radicals play an important role as mediators of tissue injury associated with
many pathologic conditions, such as inflammatory and ischemic states.

endothelial cells themselves can release both o⫺
2 and
h2o2. these ros are metabolized to h2o and o2 by catalase and cuzn-sod, which are expressed in endothelial
cells, as well as in the liver. it is known that sod selectively scavenges superoxide anions. although it has been
reported that the administration of exogenous cuzn-sod
was dose-dependently toxic to the tissue,17 wang et al18
recently reported that the overexpression of endogenous cuzn-sod dramatically prevented injury to ischemic
tissue. they referred to the increased expression of cuznsod in the endothelial cells of transgenic mice with overexpression of human cuzn-sod. moreover, fang et al19

also reported that the overexpression of endogenous cuznsod inhibited the elevation of oxidized low-density lipoprotein by endothelial cells. increasing endogenous cuzn-sod
activity by such a regimen might prevent atherosclerotic
changes.
moreover, it is known that sod selectively scavenges superoxide anions and can prolong the biological half-life of
 xxxd2738xxx  (no).20,21 davda et al22 reported that  xxxd2777xxx ,
which had little effect on induction of  xxxg1805xxx ␣, reduces the
activity of the  xxxg1577xxx   xxxg1579xxx  (nos) in vitro.
okuda et al23 reported that epa, which could induce  xxxg1805xxx ␣,
enhances no production from huvec. although preliminary,
we have found reduced nitrotyrosine content in endothelial
cells treated with fibrate and thiazolidinediones. the formation
of nitrotyrosine seems to be due to peroxynitrite in injured
tissues. a possible mechanism of no-induced cellular damage
is through its interaction with superoxide to produce peroxynitrite, which reacts with tyrosine to form nitrotyrosine in cellular
proteins.24
recently, ricote et al13 reported that a  xxxg1805xxx ␥ agonist
inhibited the induction of  xxxg1578xxx  (inos) mrna
levels in response to interferon-␥ in the activated macrophage, resulting in reduction of no production. moreover,
they have reported that  xxxg1805xxx ␥ also inhibited inos expression by blocking the activities of the transcription
factors ap-1, signal transducers and activators of transcription (stat), and nuclear factor (nf)-␬b. in contrast,
staels et al25 reported that  xxxg1805xxx ␣ activator inhibited the
pma-stimulated activation of the promoter of the  xxxg1884xxx  (cox-2) gene in smooth muscle cells.  xxxg1454xxx   xxxg1884xxx  is rapidly induced upon stimulation by growth factors
and cytokines. recently, lehmann et al26 reported that
nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs, which inhibit both
cox-1 and cox-2, also have the effect on  xxxg1805xxx ␣ and
 xxxg1805xxx ␥. it is clear that  xxxg1805xxx ␣ and  xxxg1805xxx ␥ function in the
inflammatory response. this potential action of  xxxg1805xxx ␣ and
 xxxg1805xxx ␥ might be due, at least in part, to induction of
cuzn-sod.  xxxg1805xxx  is activated by a variety of  xxxd2154xxx  and
hypolipidemic fibrates and hypoglycemic thiazolidinedione,
resulting in an increase in cuzn-sod gene expression and
prevention of atherosclerosis and inflammation in endothelial cells. moreover, our data indicate that  xxxg1805xxx ␣ and
 xxxg1805xxx ␥ ligands/activators decrease pma-nonstimulated (fig
11) and pma-stimulated expression of p22phox (fig 12),
which is a critical component of nadph oxidase.27 although we need to determine the activity of nadph oxidase
in addition to cuzn-sod, the reduction of p22phox mrna
levels might be due to induction of cuzn-sod expression
by the addition of  xxxg1805xxx ␣ and  xxxg1805xxx ␥ agonist. alternatively, the  xxxg1805xxx ␣ and  xxxg1805xxx ␥ agonist may have a direct
effect on the reduction of p22phox mrna levels. the
above-mentioned pleiotropic function of ppars might also
operate in endothelial cells.
in summary, we have shown that  xxxg1805xxx ␤/␦/ xxxg1806xxx  and
 xxxg1805xxx ␥ mrna are expressed in endothelial cells, in addition
to  xxxg1805xxx ␣. further studies should be performed to clarify

whether the  xxxg1805xxx  genes in endothelial cells confer some
benefit in preventing vascular complications. it is quite
likely that  xxxg1805xxx  activity in endothelial cells may be a
regulatory factor in the pathogenesis of hyperlipidemia and
atherosclerosis, inflammation,12 coagulation, and apoptosis28
through an increase in cuzn-sod activity.
