abstract
the nonhalogenated double ester of prednisolone,  xxxd3002xxx  (pc), is the first topical
glucocorticoid with an improved benefit/risk
ratio verified clinically and in vitro. to evaluate if this is due to unique characteristics of
this steroid, a new compound created according to an identical concept, prednisolone
17-ethylcarbonate, 21-phenylacetate (pep),
and the new halogenated monoester  xxxd1851xxx  21-cinnamate (dce) were tested
and compared to pc,  xxxd1851xxx  (dm)
and betamethasone 17-valerate (bmv). isolated foreskin keratinocytes served for in vitro investigations of anti-inflammatory pro-

cesses in the epidermis, fibroblasts of the
same origin were used to investigate the
atrophogenic potential. inflammation was induced by tnf·, resulting in an increased
interleukin 1· (il-1·) synthesis. as quantified
by elisa, all drugs significantly reduced il-1·
production. but pc and bmv appeared particularly potent, followed by dm and the two
new congeners, which revealed minor antiinflammatory activity. glucocorticoid esters
including pep are rapidly degraded in keratinocytes (85% within 12 h). hence, a ribonuclease protection assay of il-1· mrna was
performed allowing short incubation times
and thus minimizing biodegradation. this assay confirmed the anti-inflammatory potency
of native pc and bmv. in contrary dce and
pep did not reduce il-1· mrna to a significant extent. therefore pep acts as a prodrug
only. in fibroblasts, il-1· and il-6 syntheses

introduction

investigations in healthy volunteers as well
as clinical studies in patients with atopic dermatitis clearly indicate a separation of the
wanted anti-inflammatory effects on the skin
and the reduction of the dermal thickness
with the nonhalogenated prednisolone double
ester  xxxd3002xxx  (prednisolone 17-ethylcarbonate, 21-propionate, pc) [1, 2]. these in
vivo results have been elucidated by our in
vitro test system using isolated foreskin keratinocytes and fibroblasts to measure glucocorticoid effects on epidermal and dermal cytokine synthesis and in proliferation assays.

tent glucocorticoids, betamethasone 17-valerate (bmv), turned out to be identical in
vitro [3] and in vivo [4, 5].
cytokines like il-1· and il-6 are constitutively synthesized by keratinocytes and fibroblasts, production increases transiently following inflammatory stimuli such as tnf·
[6, 7]. il-1· in fibroblasts is responsible for
proliferation, collagenase induction and il-6
synthesis, the latter appears to be associated
with connective tissue inflammation [8]. in
keratinocytes, however, il-1· is formed and
partly released following inflammatory stimuli [9]. thus, inhibition of il-1· synthesis in
keratinocytes indicates antiphlogistic potency, il-1· inhibition in fibroblasts, however,
atrophogenic effects. for detailed survey of
the antiproliferative effects, 3h-thymidine incorporation into cellular dna was measured.
finally, correlation of beneficial effects, i.e.
il-1· suppression in keratinocytes, with the
atrophogenic risk, i.e. il-1· suppression in
fibroblasts, helps to evaluate the therapeutic
value. the target of our present research was
to evaluate if there are other topical glucocorticoids suppressing efficiently epidermal inflammation without influencing fibroblast
proliferation. this pharmacodynamic profile
would comprise beneficial anti-inflammatory
effects without causing dermal atrophy in
vivo. ideally, these agents should even surmount the favorable benefit/risk ratio of pc.
the new substances prednisolone 17-ethylcarbonate, 21-phenylacetate (pep) and  xxxd1851xxx  21-cinnamate (dce) followed the
principle of esterification to enhance lipophilicity and thus penetration. this allows rapid
degradation in blood and other tissues as it
was observed with pc being rapidly and almost completely metabolized in keratinocytes
via prednisolone 17-ethylcarbonate (pec) to
prednisolone within 24 h. on the contrary,
fibroblasts showed a pc metabolization rate
of about 1% per hour only [10].

spectively. whereas pc and pep inhibited  xxxg1169xxx · and il-6 production in fibroblasts only to a
minor extent, cytokine synthesis was strongly affected by the conventional glucocorticoids bmv and dm, but also by dce. the
minor unwanted effect of pc and pep on
fibroblasts was also reflected by their low
influence on cell proliferation as derived
from 3h-thymidine incorporation. again,
more pronounced antiproliferative features
were seen with the halogenated glucocorticoids. in the following, the correlation between antiphlogistic effects in keratinocytes
(suppression of il-1·) and antiproliferative effects in fibroblasts (suppression of il-1· and
il-6; 3h-thymidine incorporation) was analyzed. here, pc is revealed as the only glucocorticoid with an improved benefit/risk ratio.
native pep is shown to be almost ineffective
and dce presents exactly the opposite features of pc. it is tempting to speculate if this
is due to different  xxxg1601xxx 
subtypes or different signaling pathways in
keratinocytes and fibroblasts.

materials and methods
solutions and preparations
pc, pep and dce were obtained from hoechst
marion roussel (bad soden, germany). dm, bmv,
trypsin, sodium-edta, trizol®, trichloracetic acid,
3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazoliumbromide (mtt), phosphate-buffered saline (pbs), glutamine and dulbecco’s modified eagle’s medium
(dmem) were purchased from sigma (deisenhofen,
germany). fetal calf serum (fcs) was acquired from
gibco brl, life technologies (eggenstein, germany),
and tnf· from seromed biochrom (berlin, germany). scintillation fluid was obtained from wallac (freiburg, germany) and 3h-thymidine from icn (eschwege, germany).
keratinocyte basal medium (kbm), bovine pituitary extract (bpe), human  xxxg681xxx 
(hegf), insulin,  xxxd164xxx ,  xxxd2193xxx 
and hydrocortisone were purchased from clonetics
(san diego, calif., usa). dimethylsulfoxide, acetic

acid,  xxxd3215xxx  and ethylacetate were acquired from merck (darmstadt, germany). elisa kits
for il-1· and il-6 were purchased from coulter-immunotech (hamburg, germany), ribonuclease protection
assay kits from ambion (austin, tex., usa), iîb·
antibody from santa cruz (heidelberg, germany),
phototope hrp western blot detection kit from new
england biolabs (beverly, mass., usa) and poly[dl
dc] from boehringer mannheim (mannheim, germany).
glucocorticoid stock solutions (10–3 m ) in ethanol
(96%) kept at –80 ° c were stable for at least 3 months.
stock solutions were diluted in medium immediately
before the experiment. growth medium for keratinocytes was serumfree kbm, supplemented with hydrocortisone (0.5 ìg/ml), bpe (30 ìg/ml), hegf (0.1 ng/
ml), insulin (5 ìg/ml),  xxxd164xxx  (50 ng/ml) and
 xxxd2193xxx  (50 ìg/ml). during experiments,
medium without hydrocortisone and bpe was used.
fibroblasts were grown in dmem, supplemented with
fcs (10%), glutamine (2 mm),  xxxd164xxx  (50 ng/
ml) and  xxxd2193xxx  (20 ìg/ml).
cell culture
human juvenile foreskin from elective surgery was
incubated at 4 ° c in a 0.25% trypsin/0.1% edta solution for 20 h. trypsinization was stopped by ice-cold
pbs, and keratinocytes were scraped off from the skin
surface by forceps, filtered through sterile gauze, centrifuged (5 min/1,000 rpm) and resuspended in medium. the keratinocytes were seeded into prewarmed
medium and incubated at 37 ° c/5% co2. the remaining skin was trypsinized for another 10 min at 37 ° c.
the enzymatic reaction was stopped by fibroblast medium, and the fibroblasts were scraped off from the
dermis. as mentioned before, cells were filtered, centrifuged, resuspended, seeded into fibroblast medium
and incubated at 37 ° c/5% co2.
stimulation of il synthesis
keratinocytes pooled from two or more donors of
the 2nd or 3rd passage and pooled fibroblasts of the
2nd to 7th passage were used. mtt assays accompanied each experiment to correct results for cytotoxic
effects if necessary. for cytokine experiments, 105 cells
were seeded per well of a six-well plate. plates were
incubated for 24 h at 37 ° c/5% co2. il-1· and il-6 production was induced by 600 u tnf· (in pbs). after
10 min glucocorticoid solutions were added to yield a
final concentration of 10–8 m. plates were shaken with
350 rpm for 10 min to allow appropriate distribution.

besides differences in pharmacokinetics,
critical pharmacodynamic features such as influence on interleukin (il) synthesis and cell
proliferation were identified. with respect to
il synthesis, even native pc appeared highly
active in the suppression of inflammatory  xxxg1169xxx · in keratinocytes only, whereas il-1· and  xxxg1181xxx  synthesis in fibroblasts were not affected to
a significant extent. controversely, bmv and
betamethasone showed anti-inflammatory
activity in keratinocytes as well as atrophogenic potential in fibroblasts in parallel [3].
pep and dce effects on cytokine synthesis and cell proliferation were studied in isolated human foreskin keratinocytes and fibroblasts comparing findings with pc and also
with conventional glucocorticoids. including
new glucocorticoid entities into our investigations, we also expected a better understanding
of the cause of the differences in the benefit/
risk ratio of topical glucocorticoids. moreover, looking at the nf-îb/iîb· production
[11–14], we intended to get a deeper insight
into the signaling pathway of glucocorticoids
in the skin.

îb occurred within 30 min. disc sds-page (6 ìl of
the text sample, proteins denaturated by heating to
90 ° c for 5 min) and western blotting using an antihuman iîb· antibody served for the detection of the
inhibitor protein [20]. nonspecific binding sites were
saturated by a milk protein, excessive iîb· antibody
was removed by washing, and the specific bound antibody detected using a commercial blot detection kit.
3h-thymidine assay
fibroblasts (104) and keratinocytes (4 ! 104) were
seeded in each well of a 24-well plate. twenty-four
hours after seeding, growth medium containing 10–5 or
10–6 m of the respective agent was dispensed into the
wells, and the cells were incubated for 48 h. afterwards, the cells were allowed to incorporate radioactive 3h-thymidine (1 ìci/well) for 23 h. after a total
incubation time of 72 h, the cells were washed twice
with pbs as well as with ice-cold trichloroacetic acid
(3%) to remove excessive radioactivity. cells were
lysed by 200 ìl of 0.3 n naoh/well and shaken for
1 h/300 rpm. an aliquot of 100 ìl was mixed thoroughly with 1.5 ml of scintillation fluid, and incorporated 3h-thymidine was measured.

pep metabolism
in keratinocytes and fibroblasts of the 2nd or 3rd
passage, pep metabolism was determined as described
for pc [10]. in short, cells were incubated for up to
24 h with pep (2.5 ! 10–6 m ). the internal standard
(betamethasone) was added, and the entire content of
each well was transferred to centrifuge tubes and
extracted twice with ethyl acetate. the organic phase
was evaporated, and 20 ìl of the residue dissolved in
0.1 ml of methanol were subjected to reversed-phase
hplc analysis. pep biotransformation was determined by drug concentrations in the cellular incubate
corrected for spontaneous hydrolysis in the incubation
medium. pharmacokinetics were analyzed using the
topfit program package.
mtt test
viability was measured by mtt test as described
elsewhere [21]. quantification was realized by an
elisa reader from merlin at 590 nm.
statistics
arithmetic mean values and standard deviation of
at least triplicate analysis were determined. significance of differences between substances was analyzed
using the shapiro-wilk test, f and student’s t test. if
necessary, the welch test and dixon test were applied.
a value of p ^ 0.05 was considered significant.

were lysed in 0.1% edta solution (in pbs) by repeated freeze-thawing cycles. the probes remained
frozen at –80 ° c until used in the elisa. il-1· and il-6
were quantified by selective elisa kits following the
instructions of the manufacturer. samples were analyzed and quantified by an elisa reader from merlin
(bornheim, germany) at 405 nm. detection limits
were 3 pg il-6/ml and 5 pg il-1·/ml. the antibody of
il-1· cross-reacted with the active il-1· precursor but
not with il-1ß.
rnase protection assay: il-measurement at the
mrna level. for rnase protection assay, 3 h after
stimulation and subsequent treatment with glucocorticoid solution (10–8 m ), supernatants were removed
from the cells and incubation was stopped by 1 ml
trizol®. a volume of 0.2 ml chloroform per tube was
added, the tubes shaken and centrifuged (12,000 g,
15 min, 4 ° c). following centrifugation, the aqueous
phase was transferred to a fresh tube, and rna was
precipitated by 0.5 ml isopropanol. after incubation
for 10 min and subsequent centrifugation (12,000 g,
10 min, 4 ° c), the rna pellet was washed with 1 ml
ethanol (75%), vortexed and centrifuged (7,500 g,
5 min, 4 ° c). the rna pellets were briefly dried (10–
15 min) and redissolved in rnase-free water.
total rna prepared from the cells was used for
rnase assay with probes for the human il-1· and  xxxg861xxx  (hgapdh)
genes isolated by reverse-transcription-polymerase
chain reaction from human keratinocyte rna. the  xxxg1169xxx · probe corresponds to nucleotides 87–307 in the
sequence published by nishida et al. [15]. the
 xxxg861xxx  probe was prepared with the primers described by wong et al. [16] and corresponds to nucleotides 51–234 of hgapdh mrna [17].
rnase protection assays were performed with a
commercially available kit from ambion according to
the manufacturer’s instructions. briefly, 45,000 cpm of
both labeled rna probes were coprecipitated with the
cellular rna, resuspended and hybridized overnight
at 45 ° c. unbound probe was digested by rnases a
and t1, and the protected portion was electrophoretically analyzed and quantified using a phosphoimager
system (fuji, düsseldorf, germany). the intensity of
the il-1· signal was normalized to the one of the

anti-inflammatory effects in
keratinocytes and drug metabolism
to evaluate the anti-inflammatory effects
of glucocorticoids, we have measured the glucocorticoid-dependent decline of tnf·-stimulated il-1· synthesis which represents a useful parameter of anti-inflammatory activity.
as expected, all tested glucocorticoids inhibited tnf·-stimulated il-1· production dose
dependently within 24 h, effects were already
seen  xxxd1891xxx –9 m. interestingly, there was a significant difference in the extent of the glucocorticoid-mediated suppression. bmv and
pc showed the most effective inhibition reducing il-1· by 35–37% (fig. 1), whereas dm,
dce and pep at a concentration of 10–8 m,
revealed less pronounced effects.

effects of topical glucocorticoids on
cutaneous inflammation and
proliferation

due to the fact that especially double esters
are subject to an intensive metabolism in keratinocytes [10], and il-1· concentrations were
measured after 24 h, it remained to consider
whether il-1· suppression in keratinocytes
was mediated by the mother compounds pc,
pep and dce or by their metabolites pec
and dm, respectively. therefore, a rnase
protection assay was performed 3 h after stimulation by tnf· and glucocorticoid addition.
the results show a significant anti-inflammatory effect of native pc and bmv only,
whereas pep and dce do not appear active
(fig. 2).
with respect to pep, this was verified by
the evaluation of drug metabolism. as expected, the metabolic pattern closely followed pc metabolism. keratinocytes rapidly
cleaved the 21-ester. at 9 h, pec concentra-

tions exceed pep levels, and 85% of the
native drug was degraded at 12 h. at 24 h,
pep was no longer detectable, and almost all
the drug had been transformed to the final
metabolite prednisolone (table 1). as with

98

skin pharmacol appl skin physiol
2000;13:93–103

pc, pep turned out more stable in fibroblasts
which transformed only 30% of the drug to
pec within 12 h. prednisolone was the main
metabolite, and only spuriously low levels of
pec were seen. because of the once more
observed rapid cleavage of 21-esters in keratinocytes, the evaluation of dce metabolism
appeared insignificant. a rapid cleavage of
the 21-monoester dce could be well anticipated and indeed was shown by its influence
on il-1 synthesis.
taking the results together, pc and bmv
were identified as the most potent anti-inflammatory agents, significantly more potent
than dce and pep which inhibit inflammatory processes only following drug metabolism.

antiproliferative effects of topical
glucocorticoids on fibroblasts
to evaluate the risk of topical glucocorticoid therapy for cutaneous atrophy, we measured the influence of the test agents on fibroblast proliferation. in analogy to keratinocytes, cytokine production in fibroblasts was
enhanced by tnf·. subsequent glucocorticoid treatment induced a concentration-dependent inhibition of il-1· production. following 10–8 m for 24 h, there was a strong correlation between il-1· and il-6 suppression
(r = 0.95; fig. 3). in both assays, bmv appeared
most potent, diminishing il-1· production by

38% and il-6 even by 76%, closely followed by
dm and dce. pep was almost devoid of any
influence. pc, the potent inhibitor of inflammatory il-1· synthesis in keratinocytes, reduced il-1· production in fibroblasts by 15%
and il-6 production by 13% only. in contrast
to keratinocytes [10], pc and pep (see above)
are metabolized in fibroblasts at a rate of
about 1% per hour only, and thus, rnase
protection assay was not of importance here.
to further elucidate antiproliferative effects, 3h-thymidine incorporation assays
were performed. in agreement with our cytokine assay data, bmv, dm and also dce ap-

peared particularly antiproliferative, whereas
pc even  xxxd1891xxx –5 m reduced dna synthesis to
a minor extent only, and pep remained the
least active (fig. 4). the same result was obtained with the mtt test, which, however,
appeared less sensitive (data not shown). taking the results together, pc and pep have
only minor antiproliferative effects in fibroblasts. all the halogenated glucocorticoids exert major influence on fibroblast proliferation, explaining dermal atrophy as observed
with bmv in clinical trials.
correlation of benefit and risk
to evaluate the benefit/risk ratio, we related the antiphlogistic effects of glucocorticoids
on il-1· in keratinocytes (benefit) with the
antiproliferative suppression of il-1· synthesis in fibroblasts (risk). substances that reveal
high antiphlogistic activity and suppress il-1·
potently in keratinocytes, appear in the upper
part of figure 5. agents with strong antiproliferative effects are registered on the right side.
a substance combining high benefit and low
risk is to be found on the upper left of figure 5.

discussion

in this paper, we show for the first time the
beneficial and possibly harmful effects of two
new topical glucocorticoids on the most important cell types of the skin. regarding the
parameters used in the assay, efficient suppression of il-1·-related inflammation in keratinocytes holds for antiphlogistic effects
(benefit), while suppression of il-1· and il-6
in fibroblasts stands for the unwanted, antiproliferative action (risk). results were confirmed by proliferation assays, i.e. 3h-thymidine incorporation and mtt assay.
suppression of tnf·-induced il synthesis
by topical glucocorticoids turned out to be a
sensitive method to ascertain pharmacodynamic effects, as steroid concentrations of
10–8 m were sufficient to attain a significant
reduction. 3h-thymidine incorporation, however, was not reduced until concentrations of
10–6 m were used. especially in fibroblasts,
low concentrations of pep and pc even induced cell proliferation. this is explainable by

signaling pathway
since the observed differences in the benefit/risk ratios may result from divergent signal
transduction pathways in keratinocytes and
fibroblasts, the influence of pc and bmv on
nf-îb and iîb· synthesis was evaluated. as
to be expected, nf-îb synthesis increased
considerably following tnf· for 3 h. glucocorticoid incubation, however, did not diminish active nf-îb or increase iîb· synthesis to
a measurable extent (data not shown). this
holds true both for keratinocytes and fibroblasts. therefore, this pathway does not seem
to be of importance in the anti-inflammatory
and antiproliferative glucocorticoid effects in
the skin. alternatively, minor alterations not
detectable by our analysis system may already
result in pronounced effects.

the fact that fibroblast medium is devoid of
hydrocortisone, which in concentrations up to
10–6 m serves as a growth factor. addition of
hydrocortisone to the media, however, averts
the differentiation of effects. the differences
in the active concentrations in the test systems used here appear suitable to explain the
varying risks of topical glucocorticoid treatment: overt skin atrophy is not to be seen until
higher concentrations of potent congeners are
applied, as shown in the 3h-thymidine assay.
the antiproliferative potential, however, becomes obvious already by the effect of low
drug concentrations (10–8 m) used in the il
assay, which turned out to be more sensitive.
the strong correlation of both assays (r =
0.91) underlines this fact.
the conventional glucocorticoids tested,
bmv and dm, exhibit more or less the classical way of action. they inhibit inflammatory
response in keratinocytes and fibroblast proliferation almost in parallel. especially bmv
combines high benefit and high risk, as it
exerts significant antiphlogistic effects in keratinocytes, but also suppresses il-1· and il-6
production (fig. 3) and 3h-thymidine incorporation (fig. 4) in fibroblasts most potently.
dm did not show convincing anti-inflammatory potency, but provided potent antiproliferative effects. thus the benefit/risk ratio of
dm (fig. 5) appears even less favorable. this
holds true even more for the 21-monoester
dce which in keratinocytes appears to act via
its metabolite dm only. therefore, dce appears disappointing from the therapeutical
point of view, but scientifically speaking,
dce might respresent an ‘opposite pc’, with
remarkable activities in fibroblasts and negligible influences on keratinocytes. this, however, does not apply to halogenated monoesters in general, as  xxxd2665xxx 
[22–24] is reported to be well tolerated. this
drug, however, has been tested less extensively as compared to pc.

pc induces potent anti-inflammatory effects in keratinocytes corresponding to bmv
activity, which is well in accordance with clinical data [25, 26]. the rapid metabolism of
pc in keratinocytes [10] does not contradict a
substance-specific antiphlogistic potency, as
the rnase protection assay proved native pc
to be very active. in fibroblasts, native pc
reveals minor antiproliferative activity as reflected by nonsignificant suppression of il-1·
synthesis and by the weak influence on il-6
synthesis and cell proliferation.
the other prednisolone double ester
tested, pep, does not show comparable antiinflammatory potency in keratinocytes. although it inhibited the il-1· production significantly, too, the activity was only due to the
metabolite pec. thus, the present experiment clearly demonstrates that pep is a prodrug, which is not the case for pc. although
pep appears to be of minor influence on
fibroblasts only (fig. 3, 4), its discrete antiphlogistic effects may limit its therapeutic value. as with pep, the benefit/risk ratio for
dce appears disappointing. therefore, a detailed evaluation of dce metabolism was
omitted.
using the above-described test system, the
well-known clinical differences of topical glucocorticoids emerge clearly. this holds true
despite the fact that not all relevant factors of
glucocorticoid actions have been evaluated
here. the influences on chemotactic factors,
such as il-8, or inflammation-limiting cytokines, such as il-10, still remain unproven.
moreover, the induction of receptor antibodies or silent receptors has not been investigated so far.
nevertheless, the question arises, how the

lone, whereas pec affinity is more than 10fold higher [27]. the differences in glucocorticoid effects in keratinocytes and fibroblasts
observed here stress the need for receptor
binding studies with isolated receptors from
keratinocytes and fibroblasts. a selectivity for
different  xxxg1601xxx  subtypes
may explain the differences in effects on keratinocytes and fibroblasts. the close correlation (r = 0.95) of the influence on il-1· and
il-6 in fibroblasts with all glucocorticoids
tested and the clear separation of effects on il
synthesis in keratinocytes versus fibroblasts
hint at  xxxg1601xxx  subtypes with
different affinities for the drugs tested here.
recently, ·- and ß-subtypes of this receptor
have been described [28, 29]. given that this
hypothesis is true, subtype selectivity in keratinocytes and fibroblasts may explain the
differences in the benefit/risk ratios observed.
besides, a different way of transcriptional
activity has to be considered. as published
recently for blood cells and different cell lines,
the mode of action by which glucocorticoids
influence the transcriptional activation following inflammatory stimuli is not definitively clear. the precise way of activation and

inhibition for each cell in particular remains
to be determined. a physical interaction of
the  xxxg1601xxx  with transcription
factors [11] as well as the induction of inhibiting proteins like iîb· by glucocorticoids
[12, 30] are conceivable, besides unidentified
mechanisms.
in conclusion, the improved benefit/risk
ratio of pc results from specific drug metabolism and selective influence on cytokine production in keratocytes which is not seen with
the other congeners tested. despite this, the in
vitro assays appear suitable to find glucocorticoids with an improved benefit/risk ratio
without the need to perform animal experiments.
