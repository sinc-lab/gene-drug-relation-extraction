abstract
the effects of  xxxd2669xxx  on na+ channel currents (ina) were investigated in guinea-pig atrial myocytes and its effects on ina in ventricular
myocytes and on cloned  xxxg2028xxx  current were compared using the whole-cell, patch-clamp technique.  xxxd2669xxx  induced the tonic block of ina
with the apparent dissociation constant (kd,app) of 6.3 mm at 100 mv and 99.3 mm at 140 mv.  xxxd2669xxx  at 30 mm shifted the h1 curve to
the hyperpolarizing direction by 8.6 ± 2.4 mv.  xxxd2669xxx  also produced the phasic block of ina, which was enhanced with the increase in the
duration of train pulses, and was more prominent with a holding potential (hp) of 100 mv than with an hp of 140 mv. the onset block
of ina induced by  xxxd2669xxx  during depolarization to 20 mv was continuously increased with increasing the pulse duration, and was
enhanced at the less negative hp. the slower component of recovery of the  xxxd2669xxx -induced ina block was relatively slow, with a time
constant of 4.2 ± 2.0 s at 100 mv and 3.0 ± 1.2 s at 140 mv. since  xxxd2669xxx  induced the tonic block of ventricular ina with kd,app of
3.1 ± 0.8 mm at hp = 100 mv and 30.2 ± 6.8 mm at hp = 140 mv, and cloned  xxxg2028xxx  with kd,app of 3.0 ± 0.5 mm at hp = 100 mv and
22.0 ± 3.2 mm at hp = 140 mv, respectively, either ventricular ina or cloned  xxxg2028xxx  had significantly higher sensitivity to  xxxd2669xxx  than atrial
ina. the h1 curve of ventricular ina was shifted by 10.5 ± 3.5 mv by 3 mm  xxxd2669xxx  and that of  xxxg2028xxx  was shifted by 5.0 ± 2.3 mv by 30 mm
 xxxd2669xxx . from the modulated receptor theory, we have estimated the dissociation constants for the resting and inactivated state to be 99.3
and 1.2 mm in atrial myocytes, 30 and 0.17 mm in ventricular myocytes, and 22 and 0.2 mm in cloned  xxxg2028xxx , respectively. we conclude that
 xxxd2669xxx  has a higher affinity for the inactivated na+ channel than for the resting state channel in atrial myocytes, and  xxxd2669xxx  showed
the significant atrioventricular difference of  xxxd2669xxx  block on ina.  xxxd2669xxx  would exert an antiarrhythmic action on atrial myocytes, as
well as on ventricular myocytes, by blocking na+ channels with a high affinity to the inactivated state and a slow dissociation kinetics.

 xxxd2669xxx  hydrochloride, a phenothiazine derivative
(2-carbethoxyamino-10-(3-mopholylpropionyl)  xxxd1677xxx ) (zipes and jalife, 1995), is effective in
the treatment of ventricular tachycardia, which is attributed
to its ability to decrease the upstroke velocity of action

arations of ventricular muscles and single ventricular myocytes. data obtained from studies on ina of mammalian
cardiac myocytes suggest that  xxxd2669xxx  is thought to bind
to the inactivated state of ina predominantly with relatively
fast kinetics. inactivated state block by  xxxd2669xxx  has been
demonstrated in a number of studies. schubert et al. (1986)
and saeki et al. (1994) have reported that  xxxd2669xxx  binds
to the inactivated state with slow kinetics in rat and feline
ventricular cells. however, similar studies in various
mammalian species have not always demonstrated  xxxd2669xxx -induced inactivated state block or its contribution to
use-dependent block. for example, makielski et al. (1988)
have reported that  xxxd2669xxx  preferentially binds to the
activated state of ina with slow kinetics in canine purkinje
cells. saeki et al. described that  xxxd2669xxx  appears to
have some affinity to the activated state. these contrasting
results could reflect species-specific, tissue-specific, and/or
experimental differences. although ina in atrial myocytes
with shorter action potentials would be less affected by the
fast kinetic drug binding primarily to the inactivated state,
 xxxd2669xxx  is effective in preventing and abolishing supraventricular arrhythmias (kaverina et al., 1978; horowitz,
1990; morganroth, 1990), suggesting that  xxxd2669xxx  is
possibly an open state blocker for atrial myocytes. however,
it is not clear whether  xxxd2669xxx  induces activated or
inactivated state block of ina in atrial myocytes, although
a single gene encodes for na+ channel of both atrial and
ventricular myocardium predicting identical properties of
the  xxxd2669xxx  binding site in the atrial and ventricular
myocardium. therefore, we studied the effects of  xxxd2669xxx 
on ina in guinea-pig atrial myocytes using the whole-cell,
patch-clamp technique. the kinetics of the moricizineinduced tonic and phasic (use-dependent) block of ina was
examined, then the affinities of  xxxd2669xxx  to the resting and
inactivated states were determined from the modulated
receptor theory (hondeghem and katzung, 1977). the
affinity of  xxxd2669xxx  to each states of the atrial i na
was also compared with each state of the guinea-pig
ventricular ina as well as the cloned human na+ channel
a-subunit ( xxxg2028xxx ).

145; naf, 10; and hepes, 5 (titrated to ph 7.2 with csof).
the use of these solutions allowed the effective isolation of
ina from other ionic current. the low sodium tyrode’s
solution was cooled down to 17 c for the successful voltage
clamp control. the pipette had a tip resistance of less than
0.5 mm v when filled with the internal solution. cell
capacitances (cm) were estimated from the current transient
produced by a small (10 mv) voltage clamp step, and were
determined by integrating the current transient: cm = 74 ± 6 pf
(n = 5). series resistance (rs) was determined by fitting the
exponential to the current transient which was well described
by a single exponential. rs was estimated from the time
constant (t) of the capacitive transient on the assumption of
t = rscm. mean time constant was 98 ± 8 s (n = 5), and rs
was 1.3 ± 0.4 mv (n = 5). the series resistance was compensated by 60% to minimize the voltage control error.
several criteria described by colatsky and tsien (1979)
which permit indirect determination of the adequacy of
space-clamp control in the cardiac preparation were used.
1. the inward current record shows a smooth decay,
with no secondary humps or ‘abominable notches’.
2. the time course of the current remains unchanged
when its magnitude varies due to prepulse inactivation.
3. the measured reversal potential lies close to the
theoretically expected value.
4. the activation is a gradual function of the membrane
potential of which the i –v curve had a wide ( > 25 mv)
negative slope region, extending over a range of about
50 mv as in other excitable tissue.
under our experimental conditions, current recordings
from isolated myocytes satisfied these criteria, as shown in
the original current traces of control and the i –v curve of
the control (fig. 1). the membrane current signal was
filtered  xxxd1891xxx  khz with a two-pore active filter, digitized at
a sampling rate of 40 khz, and recorded on videotapes
(video recorder, mitsubishi hv-f73, mitsubishi, tokyo,
japan) through a pcm converter (shoshin em, pcmdp16, shoshin, tokyo, japan) for later computer analysis
(nec pc98xl, nec, tokyo, japan).
all procedures met the guidelines stipulated by the
animal ethics committee of tottori university faculty
of medicine.

2.1. cardiac cell isolation and electrophysiological
recording

2.2. cell culture and transfection conditions

single guinea-pig atrial and ventricular myocytes were
isolated by the previous described enzymatic dissociation
technique (tanaka et al., 1999), and ina were recorded using
the whole-cell, patch-clamp technique. cells were perfused
with a low sodium tyrode’s solution of the following
composition (mm): nacl, 25; cscl, 5: cacl2, 1.8; mgcl2,
0.5; cocl2, 1.0; d-glucose, 5.5; hepes, 20;  xxxd3337xxx  (tma) chloride, 105 (titrated to ph 7.4 with tmaoh). the pipette (internal) solution contained (mm): csf,

the vector prc/cmv (invitrogen, san diego, ca,
usa) was used as the expression vector for  xxxg2028xxx  cdnas.
the  xxxg2028xxx  cdna as described elsewhere (makita et al., 1996)
was used. cos7 cells were routinely maintained in dulbecco’s modified eagle medium (dmem; gibco, grand
island, ny) containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mmol/l
l-glutamine, and 1% penicillin and streptomycin. cell
cultures were kept at 37 c in a 5% co2 incubator. cells
grown on glass cover slips in 30-mm dishes were cotrans-

fected with both  xxxg2028xxx  cdna and green fluorescence protein
cdna (invitrogen) as a marker to identify the transfected
cells using the calcium phosphate method (hisatome et al.,
1998). after 48 h, transiently transfected cells were visualized by the fluorescence light, and subsequently, electrophysiological recordings were performed using the cells
expressing green fluorescence protein.
2.3. electrophysiological recordings in cultured cells
whole-cell, voltage-clamp experiments were performed
at 22 c as described (bennett et al., 1993). the external
solution had the following composition (mmol/l): nacl 140,
cscl 5.0, mgcl2 1.0, cacl2 1.8, hepes 10, and glucose 10,
ph 7.4 with naoh. patch-clamp electrodes were filled with
a solution of the following composition (mmol/l): csf 90,
cscl 10, csegta 10, naf 10, mgcl2 2, and hepes 10,
ph 7.4 with csoh.
2.4. definition of tonic and phasic block
to study the tonic block of ina, test pulses (step
depolarizations) from a holding potential (hp) of 140 or
100 mv to 20 mv were applied at a low frequency of
0.1 hz. the pulse interval of 10 s was sufficient to ensure
full recovery of ina from the use-dependent block. the
degree of the tonic block was calculated as the percentage
of decrease in peak ina after perfusion of the drug with
respect to the control.
to study the phasic block of ina, 20 train pulses with the
duration of 10 – 300 ms were applied at 2 hz until decreasing peak ina reached a new steady state. a rest of 60 s was
interposed between the sequence of stimuli. the degree of
the phasic block was calculated as the percentage decrease
in peak ina in the new steady state with respect to that
during the first pulse (tanaka et al., 1999). all data are
expressed as mean ± s.e.m. unless otherwise stated.

2.5. mathematical modeling
according to the modulated receptor theory (hondeghem
and katzung 1977, 1984), we have determined the kd
values for the resting and inactivated states of the na+
channel using the simplified kinetic model shown as
scheme 1. in this scheme, r and i represent the drug-free
resting and inactivated state, respectively; rd and id are the
drug-bound resting and inactivated state, respectively. a and
b are the rate constants of state transition between r and i or
between rd and id. k and l are the rate constants of drug
binding and unbinding, respectively; kd is the equilibrium
dissociation constant for the resting or inactivated state
( xxxg1274xxx  = lr/kr, kdi = li/ki). using the kinetic model show as
scheme 1, we determined the kdi value for  xxxd2669xxx  from
kd,app values of the tonic block and the steady-state inactivation curves (vh and slope factor). the value of  xxxg1274xxx  was
set equal to kd,app at an hp of 140 mv, where all of the na
channels transit between r (rd) and i (id) over an energy
barrier. according to the erying rate theory, rate constants
for state transitions are described as a function of gibbs free

scheme 1. the kinetic model on the modulated receptor hypothesis.

energy. the rate constants for the transition between r (rd)
and i (id) are given by:

at 140 mv, and the time constant of the slow ina
recovery at 140 mv, being given by

a ¼ ðkt =hþexp½ðdgi þ dzfv =rt þ,

kr ¼ ð1=ts140 þ=ð½d þ  xxxg1274xxx  þ,

b ¼ ðkt =hþexpf½dgr þ ðd  1þzfv =rt g,
where z is the number of gating charges, and d is the
fractional electrical distance. dgr and dgi denote the energy differences between the transition state and the resting
or inactivated state (in rt unit). the constants h, k, r, f, and
t have their usual meanings. the parameters to be
determined from the experimental data are dgr, dgi, z,
and d. the value of z and the energy difference between the
resting and inactivated states (dgri) for the drug-free
channel can be calculated from the vh and slope  xxxd344xxx  in
the absence of  xxxd2669xxx , using the following equations:

lr ¼ krkdr :
since the time constants of the slow ina recovery in the
presence of  xxxd2669xxx  were very close at 100 and
140 mv, we assumed that the rate constant of the drug
dissociation from the inactivated state (ki) is identical to that
from the resting state (i.e., ki = kr). to estimate the kdi value,
we predicted the kd,app of the tonic block at 100 mv and
the vh in the presence of 30 mm  xxxd2669xxx  for each kdi
value by calculating the probability of na+ channels to be
in the state r (drug-free resting state). then, the kdi value
to reproduce the experimental data was determined.

 xxxd2669xxx  was kindly supplied by duppone pharmaceutical (tokyo, japan) and was directly dissolved in
low sodium tyrode’s solution.

fig. 1 shows the effects of  xxxd2669xxx  on ina in an atrial
myocyte. the currents were elicited by the 30-ms depolarizing pulses from an hp of 100 mv to the test potentials
(from 70 to +25 mv in 5-mv increments).  xxxd2669xxx  at
30 mm reduced the peak ina of the atrial myocyte to 50% of
the control in a voltage-independent manner. as shown by
the peak ina – v curves,  xxxd2669xxx  blocked ina without
changes in either the threshold potential (  60 mv), the
maximum peak ina potential (  35 mv), or the reversal
potential ( + 25 mv). washout of  xxxd2669xxx  restored the
amplitude of ina over the range of membrane potentials.
fig. 2 shows the concentration dependence of the  xxxd2669xxx -induced tonic block of ina at an hp of 100 or
140 mv (n= 5). the currents were elicited by 30-ms test
pulses to 20 mv from either an hp of 100 or 140 mv.
 xxxd2669xxx   xxxd1891xxx  mm reduced the peak ina by 45% and 22%
at 100 and 140 mv, respectively, in panels (a) and (b).
the concentration dependence of the tonic block (a blocked
ration, ptb) was fitted with the hill equation (panel (c))
(eq. (1)):

where a100 and a140 are the rate constants for the
transition from the state i to r at 100 and 140 mv,
respectively. the value of a140 was calculated from the
recovery time constant at 140 mv; a100 was calculated
from the recovery time constant at 100 mv, being given by
a100 ¼ ð1=t100 þð1 þ expðð100  vh þ=sþþ:
we assumed that the parameter values (dgr, dgi, z, d) for
the drug-bound channel are the same as those of the drugfree channel; shifts in vh of the drug-bound channel, usually
assumed in the modulated receptor theory, resulted in only
small changes in the predicted kdi value.
the rate constants for the drug binding and unbinding
(k and l) can be related to the kd value and the time
constant of the drug binding/unbinding (denoted td) with
the equations:
kd ¼ l=k,
td ¼ 1=ðk½d þ 1þ,
where [d] is the concentration of the drug. thus, the k and
l values for the resting state (kr and lr) can be calculated
from the  xxxg1274xxx  value which is equal to the kd,app determined


ptb ¼ 1= 1 þ ðkd;app =½dþn

ð1þ

where [d] stands for the concentration of  xxxd2669xxx , kd,app
is the apparent dissociation constant at a given hp, and n is
the hill coefficient. the values of kd,app at an hp of 100
and 140 mv were 26.2±4.5 and 99.3±7.2 mm, respectively;

fig. 2. tonic block of ina induced by  xxxd2669xxx  in atrial myocytes. (a, b) representative original traces of ina elicited by 30 ms test pulses to 20 mv from
either an hp of 100 mv (a) or an hp of 140 mv (b) under control conditions and in the presence of  xxxd2669xxx  at various concentrations (1 – 100 mm). the
dotted line means the 0 current level. (c) the concentration dependence of the  xxxd2669xxx -induced tonic block of ina at an hp of either 100 or 140 mv
(n = 4). kd,app values were 26.2 ± 4.2 mm at 100 mv and 99.3 ± 7.2 mm at 140 mv.

the n values for 100 and 140 mv were 1.2 ± 0.2 and
1.3 ± 0.3, respectively. these results indicate that  xxxd2669xxx 
produces the greater tonic block of ina at more depolarized
membrane potentials in guinea-pig atrial myocytes.
as shown in fig. 3,  xxxd2669xxx  induced a negative shift
in the voltage dependence of the steady-state inactivation of
ina (h1) (n = 4). the h1 curve was assessed using a standard two-pulse protocol: a prepulse to a test potential
ranging from 140 to 50 mv was applied for 1000 ms,
then a 30-ms test pulse to 20 mv was applied after a 1-ms
interpulse interval. the inactivation curve was fitted by a
boltzmann equation (eq. (2)):
h1 ¼ ð1 þ exp½ðvm  vh þ=sþ1

ð2þ

where vm represents the prepulse potential, vh is the midpoint at which h = 0.5, and s is the slope factor.  xxxd2669xxx 
at 30 mm shifted the h1 curve towards more negative
potentials by 8.6 ± 2.4 mv (vh = 87.2 ± 4.1 mv in control
vs. vh = 95.1 ± 4.3 mv with 30 mm  xxxd2669xxx ) without
significant changes in the slope factor (6.2 ± 0.4 mv in
control vs. 6.1 ± 0.8 mv with 30 mm  xxxd2669xxx ). after
washout of  xxxd2669xxx , the h1 curves shifted back to the
depolarizing direction and partially returned towards the
control level (vh = 89.8 ± 5.5 mv).
3.2. phasic block of ina by  xxxd2669xxx  in atrial myocytes
in addition to the tonic block,  xxxd2669xxx  produced the
phasic block of ina. fig. 4 shows the phasic block of ina
induced by 30 mm  xxxd2669xxx , which is examined with 2 hz
train pulses of various durations (10 – 300 ms). the currents

fig. 3. effects of  xxxd2669xxx  on the steady-state inactivation of ina in atrial

protocol as shown in the inset (a). the curves (b) are the fits with a
boltzmann equation: h1 1=ð1 þ exp½ðvm  vh =sþþ1 where vm represents
the prepulse potential, vh is the half-maximum potential at which h1 = 0.5,
and s is the slope factor.  xxxd2669xxx  at 30 mm shifted the h1 curve to the
hyperpolarizing direction by 8.6 ± 2.4 mv (n = 4).

the pulse sequences with 10 s (control) or 3 –30,000 ms
prepulses were applied  xxxd1891xxx -s intervals to avoid build-up of
the ina block. the 1.0-s recovery time was long enough to
allow full recovery of the drug-free channels (toff = 34.3 ms
at an hp of 100 mv and toff=6.3 ms at an hp of 140 mv;
see below for the results of recovery), but short enough to
minimize recovery from the phasic block (toff = 4.2 s at an
hp of 100 mv and toff = 3.0 s at an hp of 140 mv; see
below). in panel (c), with 3 ms prepulse, 30 mm  xxxd2669xxx 
blocked ina by only 4.0 ± 1.2% and 2.0 ± 1.0% at both an hp
of 100 and 140 mv, and with 100 ms prepulses, 30 mm
 xxxd2669xxx  blocked ina by 5.0 ± 1.2% and 3.0 ± 0.6% at an
hp of 100 and 140 mv, respectively, while with
10,000 ms prepulse, 30 mm  xxxd2669xxx  produced the ina
block of 33 ± 4.5% and 21 ± 3.6% at an hp of 100 and
140 mv, respectively. thus, a prepulse of longer duration
accelerated the onset block of ina, and the degree of the
onset block with an hp of 100 mv was greater than that
with an hp of 140 mv.

depolarizing pulse to 20 mv with either 10 or 300 ms duration, and the

pulses were applied at 2 hz. the dotted line means the 0 current level. (c)

of 10, 30, 100, 300 ms duration from an hp of 100 or 140 mv to
20 mv (n = 5). note that the degree of the phasic block of ina at each hp
increased with an increase in the pulse duration. in addition, the more
cumulative block was observed at the more depolarized hp.

were elicited by the depolarizing pulses to 20 mv from an
hp of 100 or 140 mv. the degree of the phasic block
was calculated as a percentage decrease in the peak ina
elicited by the 20th pulse in reference to that during the first
pulse (n = 5). with an hp of 100 mv, the 10- and 300-ms
train pulses caused the phasic block of 12% and 47%,
respectively; with an hp of 140 mv, the 10- and
300-ms train pulses produced the phasic block of 13%
and 21%, respectively, in panels (a) and (b). the degree
of the  xxxd2669xxx -induced phasic block of ina increased with
an increase in the duration of train pulses, and the more
dramatic block was observed with the more depolarized hp.
3.3. onset block of ina by  xxxd2669xxx  in atrial myocytes
to assess the onset block of ina during depolarization
(n = 5), a prepulse (3– 30,000 ms) to 20 mv from either an
hp of 100 or 140 mv was followed by a 1000-ms
recovery period and a test pulse to 20 mv from each hp in
the presence of  xxxd2669xxx  (in panels (a) and (b): fig. 5).

fig. 5. time course of onset block of ina by  xxxd2669xxx  in the atrial
myocytes. the kinetics of onset block by  xxxd2669xxx  was assessed by the
double-pulse protocol shown in panel (c) in the atrial myocytes. panels (a)
and (b) show superimposed records of ina elicited by the prepulse of
various durations (100 – 30,000 ms) to 20 mv and a test pulse of 30 ms to

3.4. recovery of ina from the  xxxd2669xxx -induced block in
atrial myocytes
to determine the rate of recovery of ina from the
 xxxd2669xxx -induced block, a double-pulse protocol was
employed. prepulses of 1000 ms were followed by various
recovery periods and subsequent 30 ms test pulses to
20 mv from an hp of 100 or 140 mv (n = 5). in
the control, the time course of recovery of ina (from
inactivation) was expressed by a single exponential function with a time constant of 34.3 ± 4.3 ms for an hp of
100 mv and 6.3 ± 3.0 ms for an hp of 140 mv. in the
presence of 30 mm  xxxd2669xxx , in contrast, the recovery
time course was expressed as a sum of two exponential
terms, with a time constant of 31 ± 6.0 ms and 4.2 ± 2.0 s
for an hp of 100 mv, and 8.0 ± 4.5 ms and 3.0 ± 1.2 s
for an hp of 140 mv.
3.5. the tonic block of  xxxd2669xxx  on the ventricular
myocytes na+ current and the cloned na+ channel
-subunit ( xxxg2028xxx )
fig. 6 shows the tonic block of  xxxd2669xxx  on the ina of
the ventricular myocytes. panels (a) and (b) show the peak
amplitude of ina elicited by a 30-ms test pulse to 20 mv
from either an hp of 100 mv or 140 mv before and
during administration of  xxxd2669xxx , respectively. in ventricular myocytes 1 and 10 mm  xxxd2669xxx  blocked ina by

137

23% and 85% from 3 to 2.3 and 0.45 na at an hp of
100 mv, respectively, although 10 and 100 mm  xxxd2669xxx 
blocked ina by 28% and 83% from 3.6 to 2.6 na and 0.6 na
at an hp of 140 mv, respectively. this tonic block of ina
induced by  xxxd2669xxx  showed the voltage-dependency.
panel (c) shows the semilogarithmic plot of the drug
concentration and the tonic block of na+ current at hp of
100 and 140 mv. each point represents the mean value
of the block ratio of na+ current for each concentration
(n = 4). the sigmoidal curve was calculated from the empirical equation in fig. 1. in ventricular myocytes, kd,app was
3.1 ± 0.8 mm at hp = 100 mv and its n was 1.1 ± 0.3, and
kd,app was 30.2 ± 6.8 mm at hp = 140 mv and its n was
1.1±0.4. these results suggest that  xxxd2669xxx  produced the
greater tonic block of na+ current at the more depolarized
membrane potentials and  xxxd2669xxx  had the significantly
higher affinity to the na+ channels of ventricular myocytes
than those of atrial myocytes (see fig. 2).
fig. 6b shows the shift in the h1 curve by  xxxd2669xxx  in
ventricle myocytes. based on the data obtained from four
experiments,  xxxd2669xxx  at 3 mm shifted the h1 curve of
ventricular myocytes towards a more negative potential by
10.5 ± 3.5 mv significantly (control: 82.3 ± 3.8 mv vs.
 xxxd2669xxx  3 mm: 93.5 ± 4.1 mv: p < .05) without changes
in the slope factor (control: 6.4 ± 0.4 mv vs.  xxxd2669xxx  3 mm:
6.3 ± 0.6 mv).
after washout of  xxxd2669xxx , the h1 curve shifted to the
depolarizing direction and partially returned towards the

fig. 6. tonic block of ina induced by  xxxd2669xxx  in ventricular myocytes. panel a: representative original ina traces were elicited by a test 30 ms pulse to
20 mv from either hp = 100 mv (a) or hp = 140 mv (b) under control conditions and in the presence of  xxxd2669xxx  at various concentrations from 1 to
100 mm in ventricular myocytes. the dotted line means the 0 current level. panel (c) shows the concentration-dependent tonic block of ina by  xxxd2669xxx  at either
hp of 100 or 140 mv in ventricular myocytes (n = 4). kd,app were 3.1 ± 0.8 mm at hp = 100 mv and 30.2 ± 6.8 mm at hp = 140 mv in ventricular
myocytes (n = 4). panel b: the h1 curve drawn through the data points was described above.  xxxd2669xxx  of 3 mm shifted the h1 curve to the hyperpolarizing
direction by 10.5 ± 3.8 mv in ventricular myocytes and washout of  xxxd2669xxx  partially returned it towards control level, obtained from four experiments.

peak potentials (40 mv), and reversal potentials (+60 mv). panel b: shows the concentration-dependent tonic block of  xxxg2028xxx  by  xxxd2669xxx  at either hp of
100 or 140 mv in  xxxg2028xxx  (n = 4). kd,app was 3.0 ± 0.5 mm at hp = 100 mv and 22.0 ± 3.2 mm at hp = 140 mv obtained from five experiments. panel c:
the h1 curve drawn through the data points was described above.  xxxd2669xxx  of 30 mm shifted the h1 curve of  xxxg2028xxx  to the hyperpolarizing direction by
5.0 ± 2.3 mv and washout of  xxxd2669xxx  partially returned it towards control level, obtained from five experiments.

control level (vh = 85.6 ± 4.7 mv) without changes in the
slope factor (6.2 ± 0.7 mv in atrial, 6.4 ± 0.3 mv).
fig. 7a shows the effects of  xxxd2669xxx  on cloned  xxxg2028xxx 
currents of the cultured cos7 cells. the currents were
elicited by the 30-ms depolarizing pulses from an hp of
100 mv to the test potentials (from 70 to +25 mv in
5-mv increments) in the absence (a) and presence (b) of
 xxxd2669xxx .  xxxd2669xxx  at 3 mm reduced  xxxg2028xxx  current to
50% of control. as shown by the peak  xxxg2028xxx  i– v curves,
 xxxd2669xxx  blocked  xxxg2028xxx  without changes in either the
threshold potential (60 mv), the maximum peak  xxxg2028xxx 
current potential (40 mv), or the reversal potential
(+ 60 mv). washout of the  xxxd2669xxx  partially restored
the amplitude of  xxxg2028xxx  over the range of membrane potentials. fig. 7b shows the concentration dependence of the
 xxxd2669xxx -induced tonic block of  xxxg2028xxx  at an hp of 100 or
140 mv (n = 5). the concentration dependence of the
tonic block was fitted by the hill equation. the values of
kd,app at an hp of 100 and 140 mv were 3.0 ± 0.5 and
22.0 ± 3.2 mm, respectively. as shown in fig. 7c,  xxxd2669xxx  induced a negative shift in the h1 curve of the  xxxg2028xxx 
current (n = 5).  xxxd2669xxx  at 30 mm shifted the h1 curve
towards more negative potentials by 5.0 ± 2.3 mv

(vh = 79±4.6 mv in control vs. 84 ± 3.3 mv with
 xxxd2669xxx  30 mm) without changes in the slope factor.
after washout of  xxxd2669xxx , the h1 curve shifted back to
the depolarizing direction and partially towards the control
level (vh = 80 ± 5.5 mv).

4. discussion
in the present study for guinea-pig atrial myocytes, we
have demonstrated that (1)  xxxd2669xxx  produces the tonic
block of the atrial ina with the apparent dissociation constant
being smaller at a more depolarized hp, (2)  xxxd2669xxx  shifts
the h1 curve of the atrial ina to the hyperpolarizing
direction, (3) the  xxxd2669xxx -induced phasic block of the
atrial ina is enhanced with increase in the duration of train
pulses as well as with a less negative hp, (4) the onset block
of the ina by  xxxd2669xxx  is enhanced by the longer prepulse
and by using a less negative hp, (5) according to the
recovery time constant,  xxxd2669xxx  showed the slow kinetics, and (6) the kd value of the  xxxd2669xxx  block of atrial
ina was significantly larger than either that of ventricular ina
or that of cloned  xxxg2028xxx .

4.1. mechanism on the block of atrial na+ current by
 xxxd2669xxx 
according to the modulated receptor theory (hondeghem
and katzung 1977, 1984), we have estimated the value of
kd for the inactivated state of the atrial ina (kdi) as well as
that for the resting state of the atrial ina ( xxxg1274xxx ) for  xxxd2669xxx 
from the apparent kd for the tonic block (kd,app) and the vh
in the presence of  xxxd2669xxx  using the simplified kinetic
model described in the materials and methods section
(tanaka et al., 1999). the values of kd,app at 100 mv
and vh with 30 mm  xxxd2669xxx  were calculated for various
kdi values with  xxxg1274xxx  = 99.3 mm. with kdi = 1.2 mm, the
model predicted the kd,app at 100 mv of 27.6 mm and a
negative shift of 11.8 mv in vh with 30 mm  xxxd2669xxx ,
which are very close to the experimentally observed values.
this result indicates that  xxxd2669xxx  has an approximately
100 times higher affinity for the inactivated ina (kdi = 1.2 mm)
than for the resting channel ( xxxg1274xxx  = 99.3 mm) in the atrial
myocyte. our experiments did not clearly separate the
guarded receptor hypothesis from the modulated receptor
hypothesis (starmer and grant, 1985). the guarded receptor
hypothesis assumes a constant affinity receptor and does not
propose altered gating kinetics of the drug-bound channel.
ingress of the drug to the receptor is possible only when it is
unguarded and egress occurs when the drug is not trapped.
in a guarded receptor hypothesis, the local anesthetics or
antiarrhythmic agents are generally considered to have their
binding site inside na+ channels. however, saeki et al.
(1994) showed that  xxxd2669xxx  is only active from the
external surface, which argued for a guarded receptor
model. therefore, we applied our experimental data to the
modulated receptor hypothesis.
since the therapeutic plasma concentration of  xxxd2669xxx 
ranges from 0.13 to 6.5 mm with 92 –95% of the drug bound
on plasma proteins (raymond et al., 1987), the free serum
concentration of  xxxd2669xxx  would range from 0.008 to
0.423 mm. assuming that only one  xxxd2669xxx  molecule
binds to a receptor site, the fraction of blocked channels in a
state x ( pbx) can be calculated by the equation (eq. (3)):
pbx ¼ f½d=ðkdx þ ½dþg

ð3þ

where [d] represents the serum concentration of  xxxd2669xxx ,
kdx is the dissociation constant for the state x. from the
estimated kd values for the resting state (99.3 mm) and
inactivated state (1.2 mm), the ina block in atrial myocytes
was calculated to be
0.4% in the resting state and
26.1% in the inactivated state at the free serum  xxxd2669xxx 
concentration of 0.423 mm. since a 10% block of
ventricular ina is speculated to exert a therapeutic effect
on cardiac arrhythmias (saeki et al., 1994), the block of
inactivated ina by  xxxd2669xxx  at the therapeutic concentration may be effective in treating atrial arrhythmia.
however, we should not simply apply this concept to the
atrium. in addition, since the estimated kd values for the

139

resting state and inactivated state are based on experiments
performed at the condition of a strongly reduced external
na+ concentration (25 mm), the presented kd values are not
representative for in vivo conditions of the physiological
external na+ concentration (140 mm) and the kd values for
in vivo conditions may be much less drug-sensitive.
therefore, we might not apply the presented kd values to
the clinical situations directly.
an antiarrhythmic drug binds to the activated and inactivated states during membrane depolarization (hille, 1977;
hondeghem and katzung, 1977). makielski et al. (1988)
reported that initial block of ina by 2 mm  xxxd2669xxx  in
noninactivated cells (at an hp of 150 mv) was 9.3% in the
canine cardiac purkinje cells, indicating use-dependent
block by  xxxd2669xxx  was modeled according to the guarded
receptor hypothesis assuming ingress to the channel binding
site during the open state of the channel and egress from the
channel independent of the kinetic state of the channels.
more recently, makielski et al. (1990) and saeki et al.
(1994) demonstrated that  xxxd2669xxx  has a higher affinity
to the inactivated state of either the canine cardiac purkinje
cells or the feline ventricular myocytes than that to the
activated state, although they indicated that  xxxd2669xxx  has
some affinity to the activated state of the na+ channels. in
the present study,  xxxd2669xxx  indeed appears to have some
affinity to the activated state of the atrial ina, because it
blocked ina during the initial 3 ms of the experiment in
which the start of the block was studied. however, the
affinity of  xxxd2669xxx  for the inactivated na+ channel may
be higher than that for the activated state channel in the
atrial myocyte, since the fraction of blocked channels with
10,000 ms prepulses (33 ± 4.5% and 21 ± 3.6% at an hp of
100 and 140 mv, respectively), during which na+
channels are mostly in the inactivated state, was significantly larger than that (4.0 ± 1.2% and 2.0 ± 1.0% at both an
hp of 100 mv and an hp of 140 mv, respectively) with
3 ms prepulses during which na+ channels are mostly in the
activated state. multiple factors such as size, hydrophobicity, and charge have been proposed as being important in
determining whether or not a drug will block only an open
state or the inactivated state (bokesch et al., 1986; ehring
et al., 1988). it is well accepted that antiarrhythmic drugs in
the charged form preferentially bind to the activated state,
whereas those in the neutral form bind to the inactivated
state (clarkson et al., 1988; makielski et al., 1990).  xxxd2669xxx  molecules, pka of which is 6.26, are mostly neutral
at the physiological ph of 7.4, suggesting that  xxxd2669xxx 
predominantly binds to the inactivated state of ina (voigt
et al., 1988) the pka values of  xxxd2669xxx  (6.26) are quite
acidic as compared with those of other class 1 antiarrhythmic agents (7.8 –9.5). thus, the fraction of the neutral form
of  xxxd2669xxx  at ph = 7.4 (93.24%) is much higher than that
of other class 1 antiarrhythmic agents (1– 50%), indicating
that  xxxd2669xxx  has the potent hydrophobicity under the
physiological condition. this may be one reason why
 xxxd2669xxx  can block inactivated ina more effectively, while

140

g.u. ahmmed et al. / vascular pharmacology 38 (2002) 131–141

it is not clear that the idea of neutral charge blocker with
inactivated state blocker is proven for  xxxd2669xxx .
the time course of recovery of ina from the  xxxd2669xxx 
block reflects the unbinding of the agent from the receptor
site of the resting state channel. in the atrial myocytes, the
time constant of the ina recovery was 3.0– 4.2 s in the
presence of 30 mm  xxxd2669xxx . saeki et al. reported that
 xxxd2669xxx ’s recovery time course was retarded to 8 s and
that  xxxd2669xxx  should be classified as an intermediate-type,
class 1 antiarrhythmic agent, which is in favor of our
present data. pharmacologically, slow dissociation of the
drug from the inactivated state results in a marked use- or
frequency-dependent block of ina because the fraction of
drug-bound channels would increase cumulatively with
repeated stimulation at short diastolic intervals. the slow
recovery of the  xxxd2669xxx -induced ina block in the atrial
myocytes could prolong the postrepolarization refractoriness and cause cumulative block of ina even during the short
action potential duration of the atrial myocytes, thereby
exerting an antiarrhythmic action on atrial myocytes.
4.2. atrioventricular difference of  xxxd2669xxx  block on the
cardiac na+ channels
there are several controversial reports that the affinity of
 xxxd2669xxx  for the ina of feline ventricular myocytes shows
the discrepancies of the results obtained from the canine
purkinje cells. makielski et al. (1988) reported that in canine
purkinje cells,  xxxd2669xxx ’s dissociation constants for the
resting and inactivated na+ channel states were 13 and
0.67 mm, respectively, based on the guarded receptor
hypothesis. on the other hand, saeki et al. (1994) calculated
that in feline ventricular myocytes,  xxxd2669xxx ’s  xxxg1274xxx  and kdi
were 105 and 4.6 mm, respectively, based on the modulated
receptor hypothesis, which was one order larger than that
reported by makielski et al. the discrepancy of  xxxd2669xxx 
action on the ina in the various reports may be attributed
either to species differences or to tissue specificity. however, it has never been tested if  xxxd2669xxx  equally blocks
ina of atrial and ventricular myocytes in the same species. in
the present study,  xxxd2669xxx  blocked the ina in the ventricular myocytes significantly stronger than that in the atrial
myocytes, since both  xxxd2669xxx ’s  xxxg1274xxx  and kdi were significantly smaller in the ventricular myocytes (30 and
0.17 mm, respectively) than those in the atrial myocytes
(99.3 and 1.2 mm, respectively) based on the modulated
receptor hypothesis. there is no molecular basis for atrioventricular differences of na+ channels, although conventional understanding is that na+ channels of both atrial and
ventricular cells are the same, and come from the same gene
predicting identical properties of the  xxxd2669xxx  binding site
in the atrial and ventricular myocardium. furukawa et al.
(1995) reported that lidocaine block on ina was virtually
identical for human atrial and ventricular cells, thus they
have suggested that any difference in drug effects on ina
between atrial and ventricular cells results from the different

action potential waveforms of the tissue, but under voltageclamp conditions, na+ channels behave the same. however,
the few available in vitro studies comparing antiarrhythmic
effects on the electrical activity of atrial and ventricular cells
have not resulted in consistent findings. in multicellular
rabbit heart specimens, the reduction in vmax during a pulse
train by lidocaine was reported to be more pronounced in
ventricular than in atrial cells (langenfield et al., 1990) and
quinidine showed a significant difference in the dissociation
constants, which were nearly one decade smaller in the
atrium than in the ventricle, while no atrioventricular
difference of the dissociation constant was found for prajimalin. chi et al. (1997) reported that quinidine shifted h1
curve of ventricular myocytes to more hyperpolarized
direction than that of atrial myocytes. these data support
the atrioventricular difference of sensitivity of some antiarrhythmic agent to the na+ channels like  xxxd2669xxx .  xxxd2669xxx  blocked the heterologously expressed na+ channel
a-subunit ( xxxg2028xxx ) with the same affinity ( xxxg1274xxx  = 22 mm and
kdi = 0.2 mm) to the  xxxd2669xxx  block of ventricular ina in
the present study. this means that the affinity of  xxxd2669xxx 
to  xxxg2028xxx  is same to the ventricular ina but is different from
that to the atrial ina. we calculated the difference of gibbs
free energy for  xxxd2669xxx  binding to na+ channels in the
atrium and ventricle to be < 5.94 kj/mol. the gibbs free
energy of the hydrogen bonding to stabilize the primary
structure of the protein has been estimated to be > 20 kj/mol,
and the energy of the electrostatic bond has been estimated to
be 2 kj/mol. the difference in binding energy between the
atrial and ventricular na+ channels was much smaller than
the energy of the hydrogen bonding but was close to the
energy of the electrostatic bond. this indicates that the
atrioventricular difference of  xxxd2669xxx  block on ina may
not come from the large structural difference of the  xxxd2669xxx  binding site such as the changes in its primary structure
among them. the atrioventricular differences of the localization of the cardiac na+ channels have reported that the
ventricular na+ channels are remarkably localized in the
intercalated disks at the end; on the other hand, the atrial na+
channels are localized mainly in the surface and t-tubular
systems (cohen, 1996). therefore, cardiac na+ channels
reside at tissue-specific location, predicting the different
cytoskeletal interactions between atrium and ventricle
(cohen, 1996). cytoskeletal interaction may be critical not
only to cardiac na+ channel localization but also to gating of
cardiac na+ channels, since treatment of inside-out patches
of ventricular cells with cytochalasin-d induced na+ channels to enter a mode characterization by lower peak open
probability with greater persistent activity consistent with a
decrease in the rate of inactivation of na+ channels (undrovinas et al., 1995). the ankyrinb knockout mice display a
reduced current density and an abnormal kinetic that contributes to prolonged action potential duration and abnormal
qt rate adaptation (chauhan et al., 2000). atrioventricular
difference of na+ channel localization reflects the tissuespecific cytoskeletal interaction, which may explain the

g.u. ahmmed et al. / vascular pharmacology 38 (2002) 131–141

atrioventricular difference of action of antiarrhythmic agents.
since we cannot make the conclusive explanation for the
atrioventricular differences of the antiarrhythmic effect of
 xxxd2669xxx , further experiments would be necessary to clarify this discrepancy.
