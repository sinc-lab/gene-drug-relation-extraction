the molecular mechanism for the anti-inflammatory action of
theophylline is currently unknown, but low-dose theophylline is an
effective add-on therapy to corticosteroids in controlling asthma.
corticosteroids act, at least in part, by recruitment of histone
deacetylases (hdacs) to the site of active inflammatory gene
transcription. they thereby inhibit the acetylation of core histones
that is necessary for inflammatory gene transcription. we show
both in vitro and in vivo that low-dose theophylline enhances
hdac activity in epithelial cells and macrophages. this increased
hdac activity is then available for corticosteroid recruitment and
predicts a cooperative interaction between corticosteroids and
theophylline. this mechanism occurs at therapeutic concentrations
of theophylline and is dissociated from phosphodiesterase inhibition (the mechanism of bronchodilation) or the blockade of adenosine receptors, which are partially responsible for its side effects.
thus we have shown that low-dose theophylline exerts an antiasthma effect through increasing activation of hdac which is
subsequently recruited by corticosteroids to suppress inflammatory genes.

sthma is a chronic inflammatory disease of the airways
characterized by reduced airway patency, which is regulated
by bronchodilators such as ␤-agonists, and by the infiltration of
inflammatory and immune cells, which is treated by corticosteroids (1). theophylline has been used in the treatment of asthma
for over 70 years, but its use has recently declined, as inhaled
corticosteroids have become the mainstay of asthma control and
inhaled ␤2-agonists are more effective bronchodilators. furthermore, side effects, such as nausea and headaches, commonly
occur at previously recommended doses of theophylline. originally, theophylline was used as a bronchodilator and the optimal
plasma concentration that gave maximal bronchodilation with
the lowest risk of side effects was found to be 10–20 mg兾liter
(55–110 ␮m) (2).
there is increasing evidence that theophylline has antiinflammatory or immunomodulatory actions in asthma (2). low
doses of theophylline, which give a plasma concentration of ⬍5
mg兾liter, may achieve control of asthma comparable to a low
dose of inhaled corticosteroids in both children and adults (3, 4).
in asthmatic patients low-dose theophylline reduces eosinophils
and other inflammatory markers (5–7), inhibits the eosinophilia
induced by an inhaled allergen (8), and reduces the expression
of cytokines, such as interleukin (il)-5 (9). long-term treatment
with theophylline reduces airway hyperresponsiveness to  xxxd2586xxx  challenge (10). in addition, in patients with severe
asthma who are withdrawn from theophylline, there is a deterioration of asthma control, despite the fact that patients are
maintained on high does of inhaled corticosteroids (11, 12).
several studies have demonstrated an interaction with corticosteroid therapy and the steroid-sparing effects of theophylline
(13). in patients with mild and moderate asthma, the addition of

low-dose theophylline gives a greater improvement in asthma
control, measured as lung function, symptoms, and rescue
␤2-agonist use, than that achieved by doubling the dose of
inhaled corticosteroid (5, 14, 15).
the molecular mechanisms for the anti-inflammatory action
of theophylline are unclear. the bronchodilator action of theophylline can be explained by the inhibition of phosphodiesterases (pdes) in airway smooth muscle, but this occurs at concentrations of ⬎50 ␮m (16). in addition, the common side
effects of theophylline, nausea and vomiting, are probably
because of pde4 inhibition (13, 17). another proposed mechanism involves the antagonism of the bronchoconstrictor adenosine, which may also account for some of the serious side effects
of theophylline, including cardiac arrhythmias and seizures.
there is also evidence for other anti-inflammatory mechanisms
that cannot be accounted for by either pde inhibition or
adenosine-receptor antagonism, including the inhibition of nuclear factor ␬b (nf-␬b) (18) and the inhibition of  xxxg1180xxx - and
 xxxg526xxx  (gm-csf)induced eosinophil survival (19, 20).
acetylation of core histones by coactivator proteins, such as
 xxxg516xxx  (cbp), facilitates transcription (21). we
have recently demonstrated that the activation of gm-csf by
il-1␤ results from nf-␬b activation and increased histone
acetyltransferase (hat) activity, leading to increased inflammatory gene transcription (22). corticosteroids inhibit the expression of gm-csf by reversing the activation of hat through
the activated  xxxg1601xxx  recruiting corepressor
proteins that have histone deacetylase (hdac) activity (22).
hdacs then deacetylate the histones acetylated by nf-␬b
activation, thereby suppressing inflammatory gene expression.
because theophylline affects gene transcription in low concentrations and appears to interact beneficially with corticosteroids,
we studied the effect of theophylline alone, and in combination
with dexamethasone, on histone acetylation and deacetylation in
vitro by using bronchoalveolar lavage (bal) macrophages and in
bronchial biopsies of asthmatic patients treated with low-dose
theophylline.

(⬍1 mg兾liter). the clinical characteristics and effects on eosinophilia have been published elsewhere (5).
fiberoptic bronchoscopy and isolation of bal macrophages. subjects
attended our bronchoscopy suite at 8.30 a.m. after having fasted
from midnight and were pretreated with atropine (0.6 mg i.v.)
and midazolam (5–10 mg i.v.). oxygen (3 liters兾min) was
administered with nasal prongs throughout the procedure and
oxygen saturation was monitored with a digital oximeter. while
the subject received local anesthesia with lidocaine (4%) to the
upper airways and larynx, a fiberoptic bronchoscope (olympus
bf10, key-med, southall, u.k.) was passed through the nasal
passages into the trachea. bal was performed from the right
middle lobe by using warmed 0.9% nacl with four successive
aliquots of 60 ml. bal cells were spun (500 ⫻ g; 10 min) and
washed twice with hanks’ buffered salt solution (hbss) (12).
cytospins were prepared and stained with may–grunwald stain
for differential cell counts. cell viability was assessed by using
trypan blue exclusion. in some experiments macrophages were
isolated by plastic adhesion and cells (1 ⫻ 106) incubated in
24-well plates in the presence of theophylline, dexamethasone, or
salmonella enteritidis lipopolysaccharide (lps; 100 ng兾ml). in
addition, we studied bal macrophages isolated from six normal
nonsmoking subjects (28.8 ⫾ 0.9 yr) and six normal smokers
(26.3 ⫾ 1.3 yr).
cell culture. a549 cells were grown to 50% confluence in

dulbecco’s modified eagle’s medium (dmem) containing 10%
fcs before incubation for 48–72 h in serum-free medium. cells
were stimulated by il-1␤ (1 ng兾ml) or lps (3 ng兾ml) in the
presence of theophylline or dexamethasone.
gm-csf and il-8. gm-csf and il-8 were measured by sandwich
elisa (r&d systems europe, abindon, u.k.) according to the
manufacturer’s instructions.

direct histone extraction. histones were extracted from nuclei
overnight by using hcl and h2so4 at 4°c and using a method
modified from that as described by turner (23) and by yoshida
(24). cells were microcentrifuged for 5 min and the cell pellets
extracted with ice-cold lysis buffer (10 mm tris䡠hcl, ph 6.5兾50
mm sodium bisulfite, 1% triton x-100兾10 mm mgcl2兾8.6%
sucrose兾complete protease inhibitor mixture (roche molecular
biochemicals) for 20 min at 4°c. the pellet was repeatedly
washed in buffer until the supernatant was clear (centrifuged at
7,500 ⫻ g, 5 min after each wash) and the nuclear pellet was
washed in nuclear wash buffer (10 mm tris䡠hcl兾13 mm edta,
ph 7.4) and resuspended in 50 ␮l of 0.2 m hcl and 0.2 m h2so4
in distilled water. the nuclei were extracted overnight at 4°c and
the residue was microcentrifuged for 10 min. the supernatant
was mixed with 1 ml of ice-cold acetone and left overnight at
⫺20°c. the sample was microcentrifuged for 10 min, washed
with acetone, dried, and diluted in distilled water. protein
concentrations of the histone-containing supernatant were determined by bradford protein assay kit (bio-rad).
western blotting. immunoprecipitates, whole-cell extractions, or

isolated histones were measured by sds兾page and western
blot analysis using ecl (amersham pharmacia). proteins were
size-fractionated by sds兾page and transferred to hybondecl membranes. specific protein bands were detected by ecl
according to the manufacturer’s instructions.

acrylamide gels. gels were stained with coomassie brilliant blue,
and the core histones (h2a, h2b, h3, and h4) were excised. the
radioactivity in extracted core histones was determined by liquid
scintillation counting and normalized to protein level.
histone deacetylation activity. radiolabeled histones were pre-

pared from a549 cells after incubation with the hdac inhibitor
 xxxd3426xxx  a (tsa), at 100 ng兾ml for 6 h, in the presence of 0.1
mci兾ml [3h]acetate. histones were dried and resuspended in
distilled water. crude hdac preparations were extracted from
total cellular homogenates with tris-based high-salt buffer (10
mm tris䡠hcl, ph 8.0兾500 mm nacl兾0.25 mm edta兾10 mm
 xxxd26xxx ) as reported (25). the crude hdac preparation or immunoprecipitates were resuspended in the trisbased low-salt buffer (10 mm tris䡠hcl, ph 8.0兾20 mm
nacl兾0.25 mm edta兾10 mm  xxxd26xxx ), and incubated with 3h-labeled histone for 30 min at 30°c before the
reaction was stopped by the addition of 1 m hcl兾0.4 m acetic
acid. released 3h-labeled acetic acid was extracted by ethyl
acetate, and the radioactivity of the supernatant was determined
by liquid scintillation counting. in some experiments the ph and
substrate concentrations were altered. experiments were also
conducted using a commercially available fluorescent hdac
assay kit (fluor de lys, biomol, exeter, u.k.) according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. the results were essentially identical to those obtained with the radioactive assay.
chromatin immunoprecipitation assay. a-549 cells were pretreated

for 30 min with dexamethasone or theophylline before stimulation with il-1␤ (1 ng兾ml) for 4 h. protein–dna complexes were
fixed by formaldehyde (1% final concentration) and treated as
described (26). cells were resuspended in 200 ␮l of sds lysis
buffer (50 mm tris, ph 8.1兾1% sds兾5 mm edta兾complete
proteinase inhibitor mixture) and subjected to three cycles of
sonication on ice with 10-s pulses. sonicated samples were
centrifuged to spin down cell debris and the soluble chromatin
solution was immunoprecipitated by using an anti-acetylated
 xxxg1052xxx  antibody (upstate biotechnology, buckingham,
u.k.) as described (27). protein-bound immunoprecipitated
dna was washed with licl wash buffer and 10 mm tris兾1 mm
edta, ph 8.0, te buffer, and immune complexes were eluted
by adding elution buffer (1% sds兾0.1 m nahco3). the elution
was treated successively for 4 h at 65°c in 200 mm nacl兾1%
sds to reverse crosslinks and incubated for 1 h at 45°c with 70
␮g兾ml proteinase k (sigma). dna was extracted with phenol兾chloroform, precipitated with ethanol兾0.3 m nahcooh兾20 ␮g glycogen, and resuspended in 50 ␮l of te.
quantitative pcr was performed with 10 ␮l of dna sample and
30 cycles (94°c, 45 s; 61°c, 45 s; 72°c, 45 s. primer pairs of
gm-csf were as follows: forward 5⬘-ctgaccacctagggaaaaggc-3⬘; reverse 5⬘-cagccacatcct cctccagagaac-3⬘. pcr products were resolved by electrophoresis
through a 3% agarose gel and visualized with ethidium bromide.
statistics. results are expressed as mean ⫾ standard error of the

mean of the control and the mean from each individual treatment group in the in vitro study by dunnett’s test, and a
comparison between the mean of placebo and that of theophylline treatment in clinical study by paired t test using sas/stat
software (sas institute, cary, nc). all statistical testing was
performed by using a two-sided 5% level of significance. the
concentrations of dexamethasone or tsa producing 50% inhibition (ic50) were calculated from concentration–response

effect of theophylline on hdac activity in bal macrophages. we next
examined whether low-dose theophylline could also have an
effect on hdac activity in a clinically relevant cell, such as
macrophages that are involved in asthmatic inflammation. alveolar macrophages were incubated for 12 h in the presence of
lps (10 ng兾ml) and increasing concentrations of theophylline
and dexamethasone. lps significantly reduced whole-cell
hdac activity (fig. 3a) and theophylline caused a concentration-dependent increase in lps-suppressed hdac activity that
was maximal  xxxd1891xxx ⫺5 m and was returned back to control levels
 xxxd1891xxx ⫺3 m (data not shown). dexamethasone also enhanced
hdac activity in a concentration-dependent manner with a
maximal effect  xxxd1891xxx ⫺6 m (fig. 3a). neither the pde4 inhibitor
 xxxd3142xxx  (10 ␮m) nor the nonspecific pde inhibitor 3-isobutyl1-methylxanthine ( xxxd2388xxx ) (500 ␮m) had any effect on hdac
activity in these cells (data not shown).
interaction with corticosteroids. we have previously shown that a
major component of glucocorticoid actions in the suppression of
inflammatory cytokine production is through the recruitment of
hdac activity to the activated transcriptional complex (22).
because theophylline enhances hdac activity directly we have
examined whether theophylline enhances glucocorticoid activity
in vitro in a manner similar to that seen clinically (14, 15). in
alveolar macrophages from nonsmokers we found that theophylline (10⫺5 m) significantly enhanced hdac activity in vitro,
whereas a low concentration of dexamethasone (10⫺10 m) had no
effect (fig. 3a). combined treatment with dexamethasone
(10⫺10 m) and theophylline (10⫺5 m) markedly enhanced the
effect seen with theophylline alone and this effect was similar
that seen with 10⫺6 m dexamethasone (fig. 3a). these results
correlated with functional repression of lps-induced il-8 release by combined theophylline and dexamethasone treatment
(fig. 3b). dexamethasone (10⫺10 m) failed to suppress lpsinduced il-8 production. low concentrations of theophylline
alone had no effect on lps-induced il-8 release, presumably
because the increased hdac activity is not targeted to the
activated transcriptional complex. in contrast, combined dexamethasone (10⫺10 m) and theophylline (10⫺5 m) caused a 50%
reduction in lps-induced il-8 release similar to levels seen with
the highest concentration of dexamethasone tested (10⫺6 m).

or if it was more universal we used the human lung epitheliumlike a549 cell line. we examined the direct effect of theophylline
and dexamethasone on nuclear extracts containing hdac activity in vitro, as described (22). theophylline gave a concentration-dependent increase in hdac activity that reached a maximum  xxxd1891xxx ⫺5 m, whereas at higher concentrations (10⫺4 to 10⫺3
m) theophylline inhibited hdac activity (fig. 4a). a similar
effect was seen with another methyl xanthine,  xxxd1999xxx  (data
not shown). in contrast, dexamethasone had no direct effect on
hdac activity (fig. 4a).  xxxd2388xxx  (10⫺11 to 10⫺3 m) also had no
effect on hdac activity (data not shown). this suggests that
theophylline enhances hdac activity by modulating enzyme
function directly, whereas dexamethasone increases hdac activity indirectly through an increase in hdac expression. this
effect of theophylline on hdac activity was not specific to all
hdac isoforms. theophylline (10⫺5 m) enhanced immunoprecipitated hdac1 and  xxxg1035xxx  activity but had little effect on
 xxxg1034xxx  activity (fig. 4b).
functionally, both theophylline (10⫺5 m) and dexamethasone
(10⫺10 m) alone failed to cause significant suppression of
il-1␤-induced gm-csf release, whereas combined dexamethasone (10⫺10 m) and theophylline (10⫺5 m) caused a significant
70% reduction in il-1␤-induced gm-csf release (229 ⫾ 84 vs.

to confirm that the effects of theophylline were mediated

inhibitory effect of combined dexamethasone and theophylline
treatment. dexamethasone (10⫺6 m) alone caused a 96% inhibition of il-1␤-stimulated gm-csf release, which was inhibited
by 48% with tsa (506 ⫾ 40 vs. 969 ⫾ 84 pg兾ml, fig. 4c), thus
confirming a role for hdacs in dexamethasone-mediated gene
repression.
theophylline in combination with dexamethasone reduces histone
h4 acetylation at the gm-csf promoter. to be functionally relevant

this reduced acetylation must occur at the correct promoter sites.
by using chromatin immunoprecipitation assays, we showed that
 xxxg1052xxx  acetylation was involved in il-1␤-stimulated  xxxg526xxx  promoter activation. both theophylline (10⫺5 m) and
dexamethasone (10⫺10 m) had no effect on the il-1␤-stimulated
increase of gm-csf promoter associated with acetylated h4
(fig. 4d). in contrast, the combination of theophylline (10⫺5 m)
and dexamethasone (10⫺10 m) markedly reduced the amount of
il-1␤-stimulated acetylated  xxxg1052xxx  associated with the
gm-csf promoter to a level similar to that seen with 10⫺6 m
dexamethasone. as described (22) the hdac inhibitor tsa (10
ng兾ml) increased the amount of acetylated lysine residues
stimulated by il-1␤ (fig. 4d, lane 7).
theophylline does not act through pde4 or adenosine receptors. it
has been postulated that the effects of theophylline are mediated
through the inhibition of pde4 or by means of the antagonism
of adenosine receptors. we therefore examined the effect of a
pde4 inhibitor ( xxxd3142xxx , 10⫺11 to 10⫺3 m), a  xxxg1695xxx  inhibitor
[motapizone (byk-gulden, konstanz, germany), 10⫺11 to 10⫺3
m], and an adenosine receptor antagonist (cgs 15943, 10⫺11 to
10⫺3 m), on hdac activity (fig. 5a). neither these drugs nor the
nonselective pde inhibitor  xxxd2388xxx  (10⫺1 to 10⫺3 m) had any
direct effect on hdac activity (fig. 5a), indicating that this is
a previously undocumented molecular action of theophylline. it
is also one of the few effects that has been reported at therapeutic drug concentrations. neither  xxxd2388xxx ,  xxxd3142xxx , nor motapizone (all  xxxd1891xxx ⫺5 m) had any direct effect on hat activity
(data not shown).

discussion
low concentrations of theophylline had a marked effect on
hdac activity in bal macrophages and in a human epithelial
cell line (a549). theophylline at concentrations of 10⫺6 to 10⫺5
m had a significant stimulatory effect on whole-cell hdac
activity even after the lps-induced repression of hdac activity.
this effect was because of a direct induction of hdac enzymatic
activity, rather than an induction of hdac protein or gene
expression, although prolonged in vivo treatment with theophylline for 4 weeks may also result in increased hdac expression. after this period, hdac expression may play a role in
theophylline actions. however, previous studies (14, 15) indicate
that the beneficial effects of theophylline in combination with
inhaled steroids occur within 1 week of treatment. this is too
early to be accounted for by theophylline induction of hdac
expression in these patients. interestingly, the improvement in
lung function continues between 4 and 6 weeks, which may
reflect the additional effect of theophylline on hdac expression seen in this study. the effects of combined theophylline and
dexamethasone treatment in cells suggest that this direct effect
of theophylline on hdac activity is predominant, at least during
the short-term treatment, when rapid increases in lung function
are seen. steroids, which also induce hdac expression over the
long term, take up to 8 weeks clinically to achieve a comparable
effect seen with the combination therapy over 1 week (14, 15).
the anti-inflammatory effects of theophylline have previously
been ascribed to pde4 inhibition and adenosine receptor antagonism, although these effects occur at higher concentrations
of theophylline than are needed for anti-inflammatory actions
(2). we demonstrated that neither pde inhibition nor adenosine
receptor antagonism mimicked the effects of theophylline on
hdac activation. this result suggests that we are describing a
molecular mechanism of the action of theophylline. in contrast,
glucocorticoids at high concentrations increased total cell
hdac activity through means of the induction of hdac
protein and gene expression. this action of theophylline on
hdac activity is selective, targeting hdacs 1 and 3 preferentially, and shows the previously undocumented existence of a
selective activator of hdac activity.
several studies have shown that low doses of theophylline have
an anti-inflammatory or immunomodulatory effect in vivo (3, 4,
6–12, 29). in our current study we did not find any significant
effect of theophylline on lung function or airway hyperresponsiveness (5). however, we found a significant decrease in bal
and airway eosinophils, along with an induction of hdac
activity in bronchial biopsies and bal macrophages. eosinophil
infiltration is characteristic of asthmatic airway inflammation,
and eosinophil survival in the airways depends on gm-csf
secretion from epithelial cells (30). the modest antiito et al.

inflammatory effects seen in our patients may be because the
subjects had mild asthma, allowing little room for improvement,
and the fact that these patients were not treated with inhaled
corticosteroids. the level of endogenous cortisol may be sufficient in these subjects to target activated hdac to the site of
inflammatory gene expression.
the molecular mechanisms for the anti-inflammatory action
of theophylline are currently unclear. pde inhibition in airway
smooth muscle can explain the bronchodilator action of theophylline (16). however, this action occurs at doses too high to be
relevant in our study (⬎10⫺4 m). however, many of the side
effects of theophylline, including nausea and headaches, can be
ascribed to pde inhibition, suggesting that if the mechanism of
the anti-asthma effect were identified it might be possible to
develop safer drugs in the future.
more recently it has been shown that low concentrations of
theophylline were able to inhibit the activation of nf-␬b and
reduce the expression of inflammatory genes in a manner similar
to corticosteroids (18). in addition, eosinophil survival induced
by  xxxg1180xxx  and gm-csf is decreased by low concentrations of
theophylline independently from pde inhibition and changes in
camp (19, 20). our proposed mechanism of action of theophylline may account for these effects of theophylline on eosinophil survival through the inhibition of  xxxg1180xxx  and gm-csf gene
transcription.
the effects of theophylline are relatively small (up to 75%
increase), but, by using a chromosome immunoprecipitation
assay we can see that this drug can markedly reduce  xxxg1052xxx 
acetylation at the gm-csf promoter when targeted by dexamethasone. waterborg (31) has shown that even in the resting
state histones are acetylated and that small differences in the
number of acetylated histones result in biophysical changes.
histone acetylation is now thought to be an important area of
regulation whereby only small alterations in the number of
acetylated lysines can rapidly switch a gene from an inactive to
an active state and vice versa.
hdacs are phosphoproteins whose activity is modified according to their phosphorylation status (28). we have shown that
the effect of theophylline is mediated, at least in part, by p38
mapk. using a protein motif sequence scanning program
(scanprosite within expasy, http://www.expasy.ch) we could
find consensus phosphorylation sites within hdac1,  xxxg1034xxx ,
and hdca3. however, a p38 mapk docking site was detected
only within  xxxg1035xxx , and a potential docking site was found
within hdac1 but not within  xxxg1034xxx . in addition, we found
that the presence of tyrosine phosphorylation sites also differentiates between  xxxg1034xxx , hdac1, and hdca3. changing the
assay conditions enhanced the effect of theophylline on hdac
activity, suggesting a possible allosteric action. it is unclear
exactly how theophylline increases hdac activity, whether it is
allosteric or not, but it probably involves a phosphorylation event
unrelated to  xxxg1836xxx  (pka).
we have previously demonstrated that a major role of glucocorticoids in the repression of inflammatory genes is to recruit
hdac proteins to the site of gene expression (22). these data
suggest that theophylline should enhance glucocorticoid actions
by enabling glucocorticoids to recruit hdacs with increased
activity. we have shown in the present study that low concentrations of theophylline and low concentrations of dexamethasone can increase the repression of inflammatory cytokine
release in both macrophages and epithelial cells. the importance
of hdacs in this process was confirmed by the ability of the
hdac inhibitor tsa to completely block the combined action
of low concentrations of theophylline and dexamethasone on
il-1␤-stimulated gm-csf release. this result suggests that the
enhanced hdac activity seen in the theophylline-treated patients would enable low doses of glucocorticoids to have enhanced efficacy in controlling airway inflammation. these studpnas 兩 june 25, 2002 兩 vol. 99 兩 no. 13 兩 8925

hdac activity and since allosteric activators work best away
from maximal assay conditions, we examined the effect of ph on
theophylline-induced hdac activity. altering the ph of the
assay changed both the basal hdac activity and the ability of
theophylline to induce hdac activity from a 40% increase at
ph 8.0 to a 75% increase at ph 7.8 (fig. 5b). because hdacs
are phosphoproteins whose activity is altered on phosphorylation status (28) we also examined the effect of mitogen-activated
protein kinase (mapk) inhibition on theophylline actions. the
treatment of hdac extracts with alkaline phosphatase reduced
hdac activity (521 ⫾ 53 vs. 897 ⫾ 64 dpm兾␮g of protein),
confirming a role for phosphorylation in hdac activity. the
inhibition of p38 mapk by  xxxd3177xxx  partially inhibited theophylline-induced hdac activity (198 ⫾ 17 vs. 259 ⫾ 25 dpm),
whereas the inhibition of mek by pd098059 had no effect
(220 ⫾ 21 vs. 259 ⫾ 25 dpm) (fig. 5c). this finding suggests that
theophylline may modulate hdac activity, at least in part, by
stimulating p38 mapk-modulated hdac phosphorylation.

ies suggest a mechanism to explain the in vivo beneficial
interaction between low-dose theophylline and corticosteroids in
asthmatic subjects (13, 14).
in summary, we have shown that both in vitro and in vivo
theophylline induced a direct activation of hdac activity. in
vitro experiments indicated that this enhanced hdac activity
induced by theophylline was capable of synergizing with glucocorticoids on increasing total cell hdac activity, inhibiting
gm-csf release, and modulating  xxxg1052xxx  acetylation at the
gm-csf promoter. this result suggests that the molecular
mechanism behind the synergistic effect of theophylline on
glucocorticoid actions in vivo is related to increased hdac
activity being recruited by  xxxg1601xxx  to suppress

inflammatory genes. these data may also explain why theophylline alone is not a very effective anti-inflammatory agent. in
the absence of glucocorticoids the activated hdac is not
targeted to the site of inflammatory gene transcription. these
studies suggest that there is potential to develop novel therapeutic agents that increase hdac activity resulting in improved
anti-inflammatory actions. these agents would act as steroid
add-on therapies enhancing the transrepression兾transactivation
ratio of steroids and thus possessing a reduced side effect profile.
