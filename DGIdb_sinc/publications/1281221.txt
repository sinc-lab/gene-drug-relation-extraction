myocardial cells have two types of ca channels commonly called
t-type and l-type. whole cell ca channel currents in guinea pig atrial myocytes can
be separated and quantitated by analyzing channel closing kinetics after a brief
depolarization (tail current analysis). l-type ca channels deactivate rapidly when
the membrane is repolarized and t-type ca channels deactivate relatively slowly. ca
channel block by the therapeutically useful ca channel antagonists is voltage
dependent, so it is desirable to study block of both channel types over an extended
voltage range. tail current analysis allows this and was used to study block of both
types of ca channels under identical conditions. amiodarone,  xxxd318xxx , and  xxxd1704xxx  block t-type ca channels more potently than l-type ca channels when
binding equilibrates at normal diastolic potentials (~ - 9 0 mv). none of these drugs
is a selective blocker of t-type ca channels because block of l-type ca channels is
enhanced when cells are almost completely depolarized. although weak block of
t-type ca channels by 1,4-dihydropyridines has usually been reported, we found
that  xxxd2092xxx  blocks these channels with high affinity. when most t-type ca
channels are inactivated, the apparent dissociation constant (kl) is 13 nm.  xxxd2092xxx  also blocks t-type ca channels in gh3 cells (a cell line derived from rat
anterior pituitary), but ki = 700 nm. thus, t-type ca channels in different cell
types are pharmacologically distinct.  xxxd2092xxx  can block l-type ca channels in
atrial cells more potently than t-type ca channels, but block of l-type ca channels
is potent only at depolarized potentials; block of both channel types is comparable
at normal diastolic membrane potentials.  xxxd2092xxx  and the 1,4-dihydropyridines
isradipine and (-)-202-791 are approximately equipotent at blocking t-type ca
channels, but differ substantially in potency for block of l-type ca channels. block
of t-type ca channels may account for some of the pharmacological effects of
1,4-dihydropyridines and for the antiarrhythmic activity of amiodarone and  xxxd318xxx .

introduction

myocardial cells have predominantly two populations of ca channels, called t-type
(or low voltage activated) and l-type (or high voltage activated) (bean, 1989). the
pharmacological properties of the t-type ca channels are not well characterized
because this channel type was discovered only recently. there are several reasons for
believing that blockers of t-type ca channels would be novel and useful antiarrhythmic agents: (a) t-type ca channels are prevalent in cells that can display pacemaker
electrical activity, such as the sino-atrial node and purkinje fibers (hagiwara, irisawa,
and kameyama, 1988; hirano, fozzard, and january, 1989; tseng and boyden,
1989). current through these channels strongly affects rates of rhythmic activity
because t-type ca channels activate substantially in the voltage range where
pacemaker depolarization occurs. hence, blockers of t-type ca channels should be
efficacious in treating some forms of supraventricular tachycardia. (b) none of the
negative feedback mechanisms that apply to l-type ca channels apply to t-type ca
channels (fedulova, kostyuk, and veselovsky, 1985; carbone and lux, 1987), so that
blockers of t-type ca channels may have the greatest effect on ca influx in cells that
are metabolically compromised. l-type ca channels are subject to a number of
negative feedback mechanisms that can inhibit ca overload. these channels are
subject to ca-induced inactivation, whereby increases in cell ca inhibit further ca
entry (pelzer, pelzer, and mcdonald, 1990). activation of l-type ca channels is
modulated by a number of intracellular metabolites such as atp, so that ca influx
through l-type ca channels will be reduced in metabolically compromised tissue
(pelzer et al., 1990). blockers of t-type ca channels may inhibit arrhythmias arising
from ca overload with relatively little negative inotropic effect. (c) the therapeutically
useful ca entry blockers are thought to selectively block l-type ca channels (bean,
1985; nilius, hess, lansman, and tsien, 1985; mitra and morad, 1986; hagiwara et
al., 1988; tytgat, vereecke, and carmeliet, 1988; hirano et al., 1989; tseng and
boyden, 1989; bois and lenfant, 1991; but see akaike, kanaide, kuga, nakamura,
sadoshima, and tomoike, 1989a; kuga, sadoshima, tomoike, kanaide, akaike, and
nakamura, 1990). to our knowledge, no selective blocker of the t-type ca channels
has been identified.
we have evaluated the effects of several known antiarrhythmic agents and ca
channel antagonists on t-type ca channels. our goal was to determine whether block
of t-type ca channels could account for antiarrhythmic activity and to identify
structural leads in a search for a selective blocker of t-type ca channels. since most
of the drugs studied cause voltage-dependent block of l-type ca channels, it was
highly desirable to utilize techniques that would allow us to study both l- and t-type
ca channels over a broad range of voltages and to reliably separate these two
components of ca channel current. as in some other types of excitable cells, t-type
ca channels in atrial myocytes deactivate much more slowly than l-type ca channels,
so total ca channel current can be separated into two components by tail current
analysis. we unexpectedly found that the slow component of ca channel tail current
was potently blocked by some 1,4-dihydropyridines such as  xxxd2092xxx , which were
widely believed to be specific blockers of l-type ca channels (van skiver, spires, and
cohen, 1989). this finding generated concern that some l-type ca channels

deactivate slowly in atrial myocytes, so that tail c u r r e n t analysis could not be reliably
used in m y o c a r d i a l cells to s e p a r a t e the two c o m p o n e n t s o f ca c h a n n e l current.

a n d c o h e n , 1988; van skiver et al., 1989).

preparations
ca channel currents were measured in guinea pig atrial cells using the whole cell variation of
the patch voltage clamp technique. the enzymatic dissociation procedure was similar to that
described by mitra and morad (1985), except that cells were placed into tissue culture media at
37°c for at least 1 h before use. we chose atrial cells rather than ventricular cells for our studies
for three reasons: (a) previous studies indicated that the ratio oft-type ca channels to l-type
ca channels might be higher in atrial cells (bean, 1985); (b) atrial cells are better suited to the
whole cell variation of the patch voltage clamp technique because of their smaller size and more
favorable shape; and (c) adult atrial cells have been successfully maintained in tissue culture, so
that cells can be used for several days after isolation (bechem, pott, and rennebaum, 1983).
almost all studies of t-type ca channels were performed on the same day that cells were
dissociated because the current through t-type ca channels seemed to decrease with time in
culture.

voltage clamp measurements
the methods used for patch voltage clamp experiments in our laboratory have been described
previously (cohen and mccarthy, 1987). an axopatch 1a amplifier (axon instruments, inc.,
foster city, ca) was modified to allow low pass filtering of the series resistance compensation
and a headstage with a 50-ml'/ feedback resistor was used (model cv 3-0.1/100; axon
instruments, inc.). membrane current was sampled at 40 or 50 khz and filtered with a 4-pole
bessel filter with a cut-off frequency ( - 3 db) of 10 or 20 khz. linear leak and capacity currents
were subtracted digitally by scaling the response to a test pulse from - 1 0 0 to - 1 4 0 inv. bath
and pipette solutions were chosen so that tail currents were typically 0.5-2 na in amplitude.
larger tail currents were avoided in order to limit errors due to incomplete series resistance
compensation. smaller currents were avoided to minimize the contribution of dihydropyridinesensitive gating currents to tail current measurements (see below).

data analysis
each tail current measurement was fit by the sum of two exponentials plus a constant using the
levenberg-marquardt nonlinear least-squares curve-fitting procedure (press, flannery, teukolsky, and vetterling, 1986). the curve-fitting procedure excluded data collected before the
change in membrane voltage was complete (typically 100-200 ~s after a step in command
voltage). the reported amplitudes of the exponentials represent the amplitude at the end of
this blanking period and current recordings in the figures also exclude these data.

solutions and drugs
the bath and pipette solutions used in electrophysiological experiments were designed to
minimize currents through na and k channels and run-down of l-type ca currents. the
pipette solution usually contained (ram): 87 n-methyl-d-glucamine (nmg) glutamate, 20
nmg-f, 20 nmg-ci, 1 tetrabutylammonium ci, 11 bapta, 0.9 caci~, 1 mgci~, 20 hepes, 5
mg-atp, and 0.1 li~gtp, ph 7.2 with csoh. in later experiments, cs salts were used in place
of nmg. f- enhanced the l-type ca channel currents. the bath solution for most experiments
contained (mm): 134 tetraethylammonium (tea) c1, 20 baci~ or caci~, 0.5 mgci~, and 10
hepes, ph 7.5 with csoh. solutions with a lower concentration of charge carrier were made
by mixing the standard bath solution with a similar solution containing 165 mm tea-ci and no
ba or ca. solutions with ph 9.8 contained 10 mm 3-(cyclohexylamino)-l-propane sulfonic acid
(caps) in place of 10 mm hepes. solutions were gassed with 100% 02 and experiments were
conducted at room temperature (18--24°c).

the steady-state availability of each component of ca channel current was determined by
plotting the amplitude of each component of tail current vs. the prepulse potential. the
prepulse duration was typically 30 s. each data set was fit by a two-state boltzmann distribution,
given by 1 = l~x/{l + exp [(lip - v~/2)/k]}, where vo is the prepulse potential, k is the slope
factor, and v,/e is the potential corresponding to half-maximal current. binding constants for
rested and inactivated states of the ca channels were calculated by use of the modulated
receptor theory (bean, 1984; hondeghem and katzung, 1984; sanguinetti and kass, 1984).
binding constants of drug for the rested and inactivated states (denoted by kr and kb
respectively) were calculated using the equation ki = d/[(1 + d/kr) exp ( - a v / k ) - 1], where d
is the drug concentration and av is the shift in the availability curve (bean, cohen, and tsien,
1983). kr was calculated from the amount of block at vp = - 1 1 0 mv.
our analysis of block of l-type ca channels assumes that channel block is proportional to
block of the rapidly decaying component of tail current. there are two major concerns with this
analysis: (a) the time constant describing tail current decay (--300 i~s at - 4 5 mv) is not much
slower than the settling time of the voltage clamp after a step in voltage; and (b) dihydropyridine-sensitive gating currents decay at about the same rate as l-type ca channel tail currents
and can account for a signal of ~ 100 pa in atrial cells (field, hill, and lamb, 1988; bean and
rios, 1989; hadley and lederer, 1989, 1991). the contribution of gating currents to tail
current measurements depends on the nature and concentration of charge carrier and on the
pulse protocol. the validity of our measurements of l-type currents by tail current analysis was
assessed by comparing the current during a test pulse elicited from a holding potential ~ - 4 5
mv with the tail current measured after repolarization. both measures indicated the same time
course and voltage dependence of channel inactivation and the same effect of dihydropyridines
on steady-state availability. apparently both ionic current and gating current are similarly
affected by the drugs that we have studied.

from previous studies of t-type ca channels in myocardial cells, this extra current
component inactivates rapidly and activates at more negative potentials than the
slowly inactivating current (bean, 1985; nilius et al., 1985; mitra and morad, 1986;
bonvallet, 1987; hagiwara et al., 1988; droogmans and nilius, 1989; hirano et al.,
1989; kawano and dehaan, 1989; tseng and boyden, 1989; tytgat, nilius, and
carmeliet, 1990; xu and best, 1990; bois and lenfant, 1991). the slowly deactivating ca channel current had the same voltage and time dependence of activation and
inactivation as the transient component of inward current observed during long test
pulses (data not shown).
the results presented thus far are consistent with the idea that the two components
of tail current arise from two distinct populations of ca channels, but they do not rule
out the possibility that some l-type ca channels deactivate slowly and contribute to
the slow component of tail current. several laboratories have reported that l-type ca
channels sometimes shift into an alternate "mode" of gating, characterized by long
open times and referred to as "mode 2" (hess, lansman, and tsien, 1984; pietrobon
and hess, 1990; yue, herzig, and marban, 1990). l-type ca channels in mode 2
would contribute to a slow component of tail current. however, channels in mode 2
have the same conductance as channels that gate normally and induction of mode 2
activity by bay k 8644 has little or no effect on ionic selectivity (hess, lansman, and
tsien, 1986; but see lacerda and brown, 1989). we therefore tested for slowly
deactivating l-type ca channels by characterizing the ionic selectivity of each
component of tail current. figs. 3 and 4 show that the two components of tail current
differ in relative current-carrying ability for ca and ba. the left-hand panels in fig. 3
show superimposed current measurements in 5 mm ca and 5 mm ba at test
potentials of - 2 0 and 0 inv. for vt = - 2 0 mv, the slow component of tail current is
decreased in amplitude when ba is substituted for ca, while the fast component of
tail current is increased. the effect of substituting 5 mm ba for 5 mm ca on the
slowly decaying component of tail current was evaluated in five experiments; the
average decrease after a test pulse to - 2 0 mv was 34.7 + 3.0% (+_sem, n = 5). for
vt = 0 mv, substituting ba for ca results in an increase in the fast component of tail
current with little change in the slow component of tail current. these observations
are most readily accounted for by associating each component of tail current with a
different channel type. the right-hand panels of fig. 3 indicate the effect of
substituting the charge carrier on the voltage dependence of activation of each
component of tail current. as in fig. 2, the amplitude of each component of tail
current is plotted vs. the test potential, and the solid curve through each set of data
points is defined by a two-state boltzmann distribution. if current through l-type ca
channels accounted for a significant portion of the slowly decaying tail current, then
this component would be increased in amplitude by substitution of ba for ca as
charge carrier. no such increase was observed, even for very positive test pulses that
are most likely to elicit mode 2 activity. also note that substituting ba for ca as the
charge carrier shifts the voltage dependence of activation of t-type ca channels to
more positive potentials, while shifting the activation of l-type ca channels to more
negative potentials. the effect of charge carrier on the voltage dependence of
activation of t-type ca channels can account for the apparent conflict between
previous studies of divalent cation permeability (bean, 1989); depending on the test

preferentially increased the slow component of tail current. the effect of ph on the
voltage dependence of activation of both components of tail current is shown in the
middle and bottom panels of fig. 5. as for figs. 2 and 3, the amplitude of each
component of tail current is plotted vs. test potential (vt). both components of tail
current increase with ph at all potentials, but the voltage dependence of activation is
shifted to more negative potentials only for t-type ca channels. at high ph there is
a greater separation of the two components of ca channel current into low
voltage-activated and high voltage-activated components. similar proton block of
t-type ca channels in guinea pig ventricular cells has been reported (tytgat et al.,
1990).
the results presented thus far support the idea that l- and t-type ca channel
currents in atrial cells can be separated and quantitated by the use of tail current
analysis. tail current analysis allows the study of both types of ca channels over a
broad range of voltages and simultaneous evaluation of block of l- and t-type ca
channels. these are important advantages for pharmacological studies because ca
channel block by the therapeutically useful ca antagonists is voltage dependent. it is
therefore desirable to evaluate the affinity of drugs for the two types of ca channels
using identical pulse protocols.
fig. 6 shows the effect of amiodarone,  xxxd318xxx , and  xxxd1704xxx  on l- and t-type
ca channels. all three drugs have anti-arrhythmic activity and block of l-type ca
channels is thought to contribute to this activity (van neuten and janssen, 1973;
spedding, 1982; marshall, winslow, lamar, and apoil, 1984; yatani, brown, and
schwartz, 1986; nishimura, follmer, and singer, 1989). the top panel of each
column shows superimposed measurements of ca channel currents made with and
without the indicated concentration of drug. only tail currents are shown for the
experiments with amiodarone and  xxxd1704xxx . the records in drug are indicated by
asterisks and the amplitude of the tail current in drug is indicated by an arrow when
necessary. each of these panels shows conditions under which block of t-type
channels relative to block of l-type channels is maximal. for these conditions,
amiodarone and  xxxd1704xxx  cause substantial block of t-type ca channels with little
or no block of l-type ca channels. drug binding was allowed to equilibrate at the
indicated prepulse potential (vp) and a brief test pulse was applied to activate both land t-type ca channels. the two panels under each set of current records show the
steady-state voltage dependence of block of t- and l-type ca channels determined
with the same pulse protocol described in fig. 1. the middle row of panels shows the
amplitude of the slowly decaying component of tail current as a function of vp.
likewise, the bottom row of panels shows the amplitude of the rapidly decaying
component of tail current vs. vp. the solid curve through each set of data points is a
best fit by a two-state boltzmann distribution and defines channel availability.
block of t-type ca channels by amiodarone or  xxxd1704xxx  is weakly voltage
dependent, such that block is enhanced when drug binding equilibrates at less
negative prepulse potentials. as in previous pharmacological studies of na channels
and l-type ca channels, voltage-dependent block of ion channels by neutral
molecules can be accounted for by the modulated receptor theory. the solid curve
determined by the control data in each panel describes the voltage dependence of
the equilibrium between the rested and inactivated states, denoted by r and i,

dependent, so that  xxxd2092xxx  shifts the voltage dependence of t-type ca channel
availability to more negative potentials. use of the modulated receptor theory
indicated k! = 4.4 nm in this experiment. t h e steady-state voltage dependence of
block was also determined in the same cell with 5 nm  xxxd2092xxx  and these data
indicated ki = 7.4 nm. thus, the model accounts for both the voltage and
concentration dependence of channel block. similar results were obtained in five
other experiments, with an average ki of 12.8 +- 3.4 nm (-sem). in one experiment,
there was very little block with 25 nm  xxxd2092xxx  and in another experiment there was
litde block by 1 o.m drug.
as expected,  xxxd2092xxx  is also a very potent blocker of l-type ca channels in atrial
cells. quantitating this effect is difficult because  xxxd2092xxx  can also increase l-type
ca channel currents when currents are elicited from well-polarized cells (data not

shown; similar increases in l-type ca channel current have been seen with other
dihydropyridine "ca antagonists" [brown, kunze, and yatani, 1986; okabe, kazumasa, kitamura, a n d kuriyama, 1987; aaronson, bolton, lang, and mackenzie,
1988] and can be seen in fig. 9). it is not known whether the blocking and enhancing
effects o f  xxxd2092xxx  are due to binding at a single site. t h e blocking effects o f
 xxxd2092xxx  were observed in all experiments, but increases in ca current were only
observed in two o f seven experiments, suggesting that two distinct mechanisms are
involved. in experiments where only blocking effects were observed, an a p p a r e n t ki
of 0.43 - 0.16 nm ( - s e m ) was calculated. although the ki for  xxxd2092xxx  block of
the l-type ca channels is m u c h less than that for the t-type ca channels, the
effective binding constant for each channel type is not m u c h different over a large
portion o f the physiologically relevant voltage range, as seen in the current records in
the u p p e r panel o f fig. 7. inactivation of l-type ca channels occurs at less negative
potentials than for t-type ca channels, so that most t-type ca channels are in the
high affinity state for - 7 0 < v < - 5 0 mv, while the l-type ca channels are not.
t h e potent block o f t-type ca channels by  xxxd2092xxx  is p e r h a p s surprising
because most previous studies with other 1,4-dihydropyridines have indicated relatively weak block of t-type ca channels in a variety of cell types (bean, 1989). we
therefore evaluated the effects o f  xxxd2092xxx  on t-type ca channels in gh3 cells,
which are derived from rat anterior pituitary cells and have previously been used to
characterize ca channel block by other 1,4-dihydropyridines (cohen and mccarthy,
1987; simasko, weiland, a n d oswald, 1988). t h e results of one of these experiments
are shown in fig. 8. t h e amplitude o f the slow c o m p o n e n t o f tail current is plotted

than in atrial cells. use o f the modulated receptor theory indicates that kx = 1.7 ~m.
in six experiments, the average kx was 680 - 220 nm ( - s e m ) , so that block is
~ 50-fold less potent than in atrial cells. thus, substantial variations in the sensitivity
of t-type ca channels to block by dihydropyridines can occur between different cell
types.

discussion

our studies indicate that tail current analysis can be used to separate and quantitate
current through l- and t-type ca channels in guinea pig atrial cells. tail current
analysis allows us to study both types of ca channels over a broad range of voltages
and to evaluate block of both channel types simultaneously. this analysis revealed
that: (a) block of t-type ca channels by a number of commonly used ca channel
antagonists and antiarrhythmic agents is more potent than block of l-type ca
channels when binding equilibrates at normal diastolic potentials; and (b) some
commonly used 1,4-dihydropyridines cause substantial block of t-type ca channels
at concentrations frequently used in pharmacological studies. many pharmacological
studies have attributed the effects of these same ca channel antagonists to block of
l-type ca channels and may have thereby underestimated the role of t-type ca
channels in electrogenesis, excitation-contraction coupling, or stimulus-secretion
coupling.

affinity block of t-type ca channels and that the structure-activity relationship for
block of t-type ca channels differs from that for block of l-type ca channels. the
left column of fig. 9 shows the steady-state voltage dependence of ca channel block
by isradipine ( xxxd2405xxx -110) for a guinea pig atrial cell. isradipine is a very potent
blocker of l-type ca channels often used in 3h-ligand binding studies (hof,
scholtysik, loutzenhiser, vuorela, and neumann, 1984; kokubun, prod'hom,
becker, porzig, and reuter, 1986). the top left panel shows superimposed measurements of ca channel currents made with and without 10 nm isradipine. isradipine
reduced the inward current during the test pulse and both components of tail current
when the membrane was repolarized. the effects of (-)-202-791 under the same
conditions are shown in the top right panel. this compound was tested because it is
structurally similar to isradipine, but is known to be a weaker blocker of l-type ca
channels (kokubun et al., 1986). currents were increased by the drug during the test
pulse, and the tail current measurements indicate that current through the l-type ca
channels was increased, while current through the t-type ca channels was decreased.
the four other panels of this figure show the steady-state voltage dependence of
block of both types of ca channels by both dihydropyridines. channel block was
assayed by tail current analysis, as described above. isradipine and (-)-202-791 are
approximately equipotent at blocking t-type ca channels, with ki = 20.4 nm for
isradipine and ki = 15.3 nm for (-)-202-791. however, these two compounds are
quite dissimilar in their effect on l-type ca channels, as is already apparent from the
two top panels. as already indicated for our studies with  xxxd2092xxx , there is presently
no theoretical framework that allows us to quantitate the two effects of (-)-202-791 on
l-type ca channels. if we ignore the increase in ca current, then a kx of 4 nm is
inferred, so that the ratio of the high affinity binding constants for the two types of
ca channels (t/l) is 3.6. the ratio of the high affinity binding constants for
isradipine (t/l) is ~25. this calculation correctly indicates that 1,4-dihydropyridines differ significantly in the relative affinity for the two types of ca channels.
however, the calculation is misleading in that it suggests that block of l-type ca
channels is more potent than block of t-type ca channels for both drugs, when in
fact (-)-202-791 selectively blocks t-type ca channels at most voltages.

the slowly deactivating component of tail current provides a reliable indicator of
the instantaneous conductance of t-type ca channels

downloaded from jgp.rupress.org on may 24, 2015

the two components of ca channel tail current have different activation, inactivation,
and deactivation kinetics and different selectivities for ca vs. ba. these results can
best be explained by invoking two distinct populations of ca channels similar to the
l- and t-type ca channels previously described in myocardial cells (bean, 1985;
nilius et al., 1985; mitra and morad, 1986; bonvallet, 1987; hagiwara et al., 1988;
droogmans and nilius, 1989; hirano et al., 1989; kawano and dehaan, 1989; tseng
and boyden, 1989; tytgat et al., 1990; xu and best, 1990).
our analysis of ca channel block rests on the assertion that the slowly deactivating
component of tail current is entirely due to current through t-type ca channels.
changes in the amplitude of the tail current with changes in the concentration of
bath ca or ba indicate that these divalent cations are the only significant charge
carriers (see figs. 3 and 4). the tail current was not through na channels because it
was unaffected by 30 wm tetrodotoxin (data not shown). slowly deactivating current
through l-type ca channels has been demonstrated in ventricular cells and was a
particular concern for our studies (bean and rios, 1989; pietrobon and hess, 1990;
yue et al., 1990). mode 2 activity is most prevalent after long test pulses to very
positive potentials or during rapid trains of test pulses (pietrobon and hess, 1990).
slowly deactivating tail currents associated with l-type ca channels could be detected
in guinea pig atrial cells only after very strong test depolarizations (data not shown).
almost all of the tail current analysis evaluating block of t-type ca channels was done
using test pulse durations < 10 ms and test potentials _<+30 inv. the evidence
against significant mode 2 activity under these conditions is as follows: (a) test pulses
from a holding potential of - 3 0 mv did not elicit slowly decaying tail currents (see
fig. 1); (b) the voltage dependence of inactivation of the slow component of tail
current was the same for test potentials of + 10 and +60 mv, even though activation
of the l-type ca channels is much greater at the more positive test potential (data
not shown); (c) the slowly decaying component of tail current was not increased by
substituting ba for ca as charge cartier, while currents through l-type channels were
increased by this change (see figs. 3 and 4); and (d) changes in the amplitude of the
two components of tail current caused by ca channel antagonists were not correlated
(see fig. 9).
although most properties of the slowly deactivating ca current are consistent with
previous descriptions of t-type ca current in myocardial cells, several significant
differences exist. the boltzmann distribution describing the voltage dependence of
activation of slowly deactivating ca current typically had a slope factor of ~ 15 (see
figs. 2, 3, and 5), while most studies of t-type ca channels report a much steeper
voltage dependence of activation, with slope factors ranging from 4.4 to 6.3
(hagiwara et al., 1988; hirano et al., 1989; tytgat et al., 1990; xu and best, 1990).
some of the difference in activation kinetics may derive from methodological
differences (we used an isochronal measurement of activation while previous studies
calculated maximal conductance at each voltage), but genuine heterogeneity in the
properties of t-type ca channels apparently exists. considerable variation in
activation kinetics was found in our studies, with slope factors as low as 3 or as high as

block of t-type ca channels by ca channel antagonists and antiarrhythmic agents
l-type ca channels have many distinct binding sites for ca antagonists 0anis, silver,
and triggle, 1987; hosey and lazdunski, 1988). the three best-described binding
sites are those for 1,4-dihydropyridines, verapamil, and diltiazem, but many structurally dissimilar classes of compounds can block l-type ca channels. the potent block
of t-type ca channels by amiodarone,  xxxd318xxx ,  xxxd1704xxx , and  xxxd2092xxx  indicates
that t-type ca channels have multiple binding sites for drugs similar to those on
l-type ca channels.
 xxxd1704xxx  binds to a site on l-type ca channels distinct from that for dihydropyridines, diltiazem, or verapamil (siegl, garcia, king, scott, morgan, and kaczorowski,
1988).  xxxd1704xxx  block of t-type ca channels was particularly interesting for two
reasons: (a) the high affinity binding constant (k0 of  xxxd1704xxx  for t-type ca
channels is comparable to that for l-type ca channels, while all other drugs studied
bind more strongly to l-type ca channels; and (b) block of t-type ca channels is
strongly voltage dependent, in a manner similar to the block of na channels and
l-type ca channels by therapeutically useful drugs. voltage-dependent channel block
can account in part for the tissue specificity of class i antiarrhythmic agents and
clinically used ca antagonists (hondeghem and katzung, 1984).  xxxd2125xxx , a
congener of  xxxd1704xxx , blocks t-type ca channels in aortic smooth muscle,
ventricular myocytes, and hippocampal and hypothalamic neurons (tytgat et al.,
1988; akaike et al., 1989a; akaike, kostyuk, and osipchuk, 1989b; kuga et al., 1990;
takahashi and akaike, 1991). the potency of  xxxd2125xxx  block oft-type ca channels
differs dramatically in these studies. hence, studies with  xxxd2125xxx  support our
conclusion, based on studies with  xxxd2092xxx , that t-type ca channels are pharmacologically heterogeneous.
 xxxd318xxx  is an arylalkylamine analogue of verapamil. inhibition of verapamil
binding to l-type ca channels is consistent with competitive block (garcia, trumble,
reuben, and kaczorowski, 1984; galizzi, borsotto, barhanin, fosset, and lazdunski,
1986). although verapamil and gallopamil are reportedly weak blockers oft-type ca
channels in myocardial cells (hagiwara et al., 1988; tytgat et al., 1988), we found
fairly potent block by  xxxd318xxx .  xxxd318xxx  block of t-type ca channels is more potent
than block of na channels or l-type ca channels when binding equilibrates in

23. it is interesting to note that slowly deactivating ca channels in basilar artery
smooth muscle have a shallow voltage dependence of activation and are highly
sensitive to block by nifedipine (simard, 1991).
our results indicate methods for enhancing the isolation of t-type ca currents.
the separation of ca channel currents into low voltage-activated and high voltageactivated components is enhanced by using ca rather than ba as the charge carrier
and by increasing the bath ph (see figs. 3 and 5). many studies of t-type ca
channels use ba as charge carrier in order to prevent ca-induced inactivation of
l-type ca channels and thereby better separate the two components of current based
on their rate of inactivation. however, this advantage is negated by buffering cell ca
with high concentrations of bapta in the pipette solution. ba is also sometimes used
as charge carrier to maximize the amplitude of l-type ca currents, but we found that
l-type currents are not always increased when ba is substituted for ca as the charge
carrier (see fig. 4).

well-polarized cells (see fig. 8 and yatani et al., 1986), which may account in part for
the activity of this drug in treating supraventricular arrhythmias. block of l-type ca
channels in guinea pig ventricular cells similar to our results has been reported
(yatani et al., 1986).
amiodarone is effective in treating some forms of ventricular arrhythmias that are
resistant to other drugs (mason, 1987). the mechanism of action of this drug is
ill-defined because many ion channels are blocked by drug. the most potent block is
of na channels and l-type ca channels (follmer, aomine, yeh, and singer, 1987;
nishimura et al., 1989). the apparent binding constants for the inactivated state of
na and l-type ca channels are 120 and 360 nm, respectively. it is difficult to
compare our results with amiodarone with previous studies because the onset of
channel block is very slow. however, block of t-type ca channels is likely to be
relevant to the therapeutic activity because block of t-type ca channels is approximately equipotent to that for l-type ca channels (see fig. 8, with kx -~ 1 ~m for both
channel types).
although amiodarone,  xxxd318xxx , and  xxxd1704xxx  block t-type ca channels more
potently than l-type ca channels when binding equilibrates at normal diastolic
potentials, the relative potency of ca channel block may differ in working myocardium that is electrically driven.
our results with  xxxd2092xxx  and isradipine are not inconsistent with previous
reports that some t-type ca channels are relatively insensitive to block by 1,4dihydropyridines. high affinity block of t-type ca channels by  xxxd2092xxx  is tissue
specific (see figs. 7 and 8). block of l-type ca channels by dihydropyridines also
differs substantially between different cell types and the partition coefficient of these
drugs into the membrane may be an important factor in accounting for the tissue
specificity of block (mccarthy and cohen, 1989). similar factors may contribute to
the tissue specificity of block of t-type ca channels. most previous studies also used
dihydropyridines other than those reported on in this study and the choice of drug is
significant. for example, nifedipine and  xxxd2728xxx  are significantly weaker blockers
of t-type ca channels in guinea pig atrial cells than  xxxd2092xxx  or isradipine, with
ki = 100 nm (data not shown). finally, most previous studies with dihydropyridines
did not evaluate block of the l- and t-type ca channels at the same voltage; block of
l-type ca channels is often shown only in depolarized cells, where block is most
potent.
high affinity block of t-type ca channels by 1,4-dihydropyridines has previously
been reported in aortic and portal vein smooth muscle cells (loirand, mironneau,
mironneau, and pacaud, 1989; kuga et al., 1990). in these studies, t-type ca
channel current was isolated by dialyzing the cell with solutions that contained f- or
high concentrations of ca ions. hence, the potency of block of l- and t-type ca
channels was evaluated in parallel experiments under different ionic conditions. our
studies allowed simultaneous evaluation of block of both channel types, with qualitatively similar results. however, we never observed increases in t-type ca current
produced by dihydropyridines, such as the  xxxd2718xxx -induced increase observed in
aortic smooth muscle (kuga et al., 1990).
several other previous studies suggest potent block of t-type ca channels by
dihydropyridines: (a) smooth muscle cells from rabbit mesenteric arteries contain a
ca channel with a conductance of 10 ps that is blocked by  xxxd2734xxx  with high

affinity (worley, deitmer, and nelson, 1986). l-type ca channels usually have a
conductance of ~ 25 ps, while t-type ca channels have a conductance of ~ 9 ps
(bean, 1989). (b) all of the ca current in smooth muscle cells from rabbit ear artery is
potently blocked by nifedipine (aaronson et al., 1988) and these cells contain both land t-type ca channels (benham, hess, and tsien, 1987). (c) noradrenaline
increases t-type ca channel current and decreases l-type ca channel current in rat
portal vein cells and the contractions induced by noradrenaline are potently blocked
by dihydropyridines (dacquet, mironneau, and mironneau, 1987; pacaud, loirand,
mironneau, and mironneau, 1987). (d)  xxxd2737xxx  blocks t-type ca channels in
adrenal glomerulosa cells, with kl = 190 nm (cohen et al., 1988).  xxxd2737xxx  is
probably a weaker blocker of t-type ca channels than  xxxd2092xxx  or isradipine.
the t-type ca channels in atrial cells have many properties in common with the
dihydropyridine-sensitive ca channels in skeletal muscle. both channel types have a
primary conductance of ~ 10 ps, are less sensitive to dihydropyridine block than
cardiac l-type ca channels, show little or no ca-dependent inactivation, and have
similar conductances for ca and ba (rosenberg, hess, reeves, smilowitz, and tsien,
1986; smith, mckenna, ma, vilven, vaghy, schwartz, and coronado, 1987; beam
and knudson, 1988). a major difference between the skeletal muscle channel and
cardiac t-type ca channels is that current is enhanced by bay k 8644 only for the
skeletal muscle channel. however, the same gene codes for both the skeletal muscle
channel and dihydropyridine-sensitive charge movement, and charge movement is
not increased by bay k 8644 (lamb and walsh, 1987; rios and brum, 1987;
tanabe, beam, powell, and numa, 1988).
1,4-dihydropyridines have often been used as probes to test for the involvement of
l-type ca channels in ca-dependent signal transduction. drug effects are often
evaluated in cells that are relatively well polarized or are only depolarized for brief
periods during trains of action potentials. our results indicate that dihydropyridines
may not be selective blockers of l-type ca channels if block is assayed under
conditions where t-type ca channels are available to open. a similar conclusion was
reached in studies with rat aortic smooth muscle and hypothalamic neurons (akaike
et al., 1989a, b; kuga et al., 1990). the potency of dihydropyridine block of l-type
ca channels seems to vary substantially between different tissues, with much weaker
block in some neuronal and endocrine cells than in myocardial or smooth muscle
cells (boll and lux, 1985; gahwiler and brown, 1987; holz, dunlap, and kream,
1988; but see jones and jacobs, 1990). hence, the block of t-type ca channels in
guinea pig atrial cells is much more potent than block of l-type ca channels in some
other tissues. consequently, the role of t-type ca channels in excitation-contraction
coupling or stimulus-secretion coupling may have been greatly underestimated.
