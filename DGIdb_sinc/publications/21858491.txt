abstract
objective: the objective of this review is to
evaluate the safety and efficacy of  xxxd3274xxx ,
a fluoroprostaglandin receptor analog, for
reduction of intraocular pressure in open
angle glaucoma and ocular hypertension.
methods: a search of published literature was
performed on the pubmed database using the
search term “ xxxd3274xxx .” the literature search
identified 48 publications, including clinical
and preclinical studies, from 2003 to 2011.
from these ressults, articles available in the
english language and in full text were selected
and systematically reviewed by the authors.
results: recent studies have shown that  xxxd3274xxx 
is an effective iop-lowering medication. evidence

based medicine also reveals that  xxxd3274xxx  is safe
and well-tolerated. preservative-free  xxxd3274xxx 
is as potent as the preserved formulation, but
with fewer and milder ocular surface side effects.
conclusion: since its introduction in 2008,
initial studies have demonstrated that preserved
and preservative-free  xxxd3274xxx  formulations
have proven efficacy and safety in the treatment
of glaucoma and ocular hypertension. larger
studies with longer follow-up are needed to
assess long-term safety, efficacy, and tolerability
compared with other prostaglandin analogs used
for treating glaucoma.

increased intraocular pressure (iop) is
considered a primary factor in the pathogenesis
of glaucoma and is the only modifiable risk
factor known at this time. 1-4 prostaglandin
(pg) analogs (pga) are currently used as firstline therapy for the treatment of open angle
glaucoma (oag) and ocular hypertension
(ohtn) because of their potent iop-lowering
efficacy, low likelihood of systemic adverse

708

effects, once-daily dosing, and good patient
adherence.  xxxd3274xxx  is a novel pga with high
affinity for the fluoroprostaglandin (fp) receptor
pgf 2alpha . initial studies have demonstrated
excellent iop reduction in pre-clinical studies as
well as in multiple clinical trials.5-10 it has been
approved for ophthalmic use in a number of
markets worldwide. this review will focus on
the efficacy and safety profile of  xxxd3274xxx  as
well as the potential role of the preservative free
 xxxd3274xxx  formulation in reducing long-term
ocular side effects.

methods
the search of the pubmed database was performed
using the search term “ xxxd3274xxx .” the literature
search identified 48 publications from 2003 to
2011. articles available in full text and in the
english language were systematically reviewed by
the authors and included in this review.

pharmacological profile of
 xxxd3274xxx 
 xxxd3274xxx  (1-methylethyl [5z]-7-[(1r,2r,3r,5s)
-2-[(1e)-3,3-difluoro-4-phenoxy-1-butenyl]-3,5dihydroxycyclo-pentyl]-5- heptenoate)
is a 16-phenoxy analog of pgf 2alpha with a
15,15-difluoro substitution.6,11 it is an isopropyl
ester that, like other pga, is rapidly hydrolyzed
by corneal esterases to the free acid of  xxxd3274xxx ,
which is the active form. because of its difluoro
substitution, ketonization by 15-hydroxydehydrogenase (one of the major pathways
involved in the metabolic degradation of pg)
does not occur with this compound. instead, the
drug is metabolized only through beta-oxidation
of the alpha-chain of the pg skeleton. despite
this lone pathway for metabolic degradation,
 xxxd3274xxx  did not appear to accumulate in rat
studies.12  xxxd3274xxx  increases in vivo uveoscleral

outflow as measured by fluorophotometry. 6
after both single and repeated topical dosing, the
plasma concentration of  xxxd3274xxx  remains low.
the active form,  xxxd3274xxx  acid, can be detected
in plasma for up to one hour after topical
administration, with a peak  xxxd1891xxx  minutes. 10
 xxxd3274xxx  has an affinity for the  xxxg1878xxx 
that is approximately 12 times higher than that
of the carboxylic acid of  xxxd2446xxx , but with
almost no potential to bind to other receptors.6
in comparison, the affinity of  xxxd3414xxx  for the
 xxxg1878xxx  has been reported to be
2.8 times as high as that of  xxxd2446xxx .13

 xxxd3274xxx  efficacy and
safety - preclinical and
animal studies
the iop-lowering action of  xxxd3274xxx  has been
demonstrated both in ocular normotensive
monkeys and in laser-induced ocular
hypertensive monkeys. 6 in both the ocular
hypertensive and normotensive groups, singledose applications of  xxxd3274xxx  (0.00002%
to 0.0025%) induced a dose-dependent iop
reduction. in the normotensive monkeys, a
statistically significant iop reduction compared
to vehicle was achieved with a single dose of
 xxxd3274xxx  at doses of 0.0005% and 0.0025%.
the iop reduction of  xxxd3274xxx  at 0.0025%
was significantly greater than  xxxd2446xxx  at
0.005%, while with  xxxd3274xxx  at 0.0005% it
was almost equal to that of  xxxd2446xxx  in
this group. when the normotensive monkeys
received repeated doses of  xxxd3274xxx  (0.0015%,
0.0025%, or 0.005%) once-daily for 5 days,
iop-lowering was achieved on the first, third,
and fifth days of administration, without an
attenuation of efficacy over time. similarly,
0.005% of  xxxd2446xxx  achieved iop reduction
at days 1, 3, and 5, however, iop returned to
baseline when measured at the trough time-point

adv ther (2011) 28(9):707-715.

(24 hours after drug administration) on each
day. in contrast, when any concentration
of  xxxd3274xxx  was administered, iop levels at
the trough-points of day 3 through 5 were
significantly lower than those in the vehicletreatment group.6 these results suggest that the
duration of action of  xxxd3274xxx  may be extended
upon repeated dosing. kurashima et al. tested
10 monkeys with a low susceptibility to
 xxxd2446xxx  and first confirmed an inadequate
reduction of iop in response to treatment with
the drug.14 the monkeys were then switched
to  xxxd3274xxx  therapy and the responses
were compared. they demonstrated that
the magnitude of iop reduction induced by
 xxxd3274xxx  0.0015% (2.4 mmhg) was significantly
greater than  xxxd2446xxx  0.005% (0.4 mmhg) in
all monkeys tested (p<0.01).14
a dose-dependent reduction of iop with
 xxxd3274xxx  was also demonstrated in the eyes
of prostanoid fp-receptor deficient mice. 15
 xxxd3274xxx ’s effect on iop was similar to that
of  xxxd3414xxx , but stronger and more durable
than that of  xxxd2446xxx . in this animal model,
ota et al. also confirmed that  xxxd3274xxx  lowered
iop via prostanoid fp receptors, and found
that part of the hypotensive effect may be
related to  xxxg1878xxx -mediated pg production
and stimulation of pg e3 (ep3) receptors.16
this iop-lowering effect in mice was confirmed
by akaishi et al.17
recent clinical studies have suggested
that impaired blood flow to the optic nerve
head (onh) may contribute to glaucomatous
optic neuropathy. 18 blood flow to the onh
was significantly lower in patients with oag
compared to ocular hypertension patients or
normal volunteers. 19,20 it has been suggested
that a decrease in onh blood flow is linked to
the progressive visual field loss in glaucoma.21,22
izumi et al. noted that administration of
 xxxd3274xxx  0.0015% significantly increased retinal

709

blood flow and blood velocity as measured
by laser doppler velocimetry in cats. 23 this
observation was then confirmed by akaishi et
al. who found that onh blood flow increased
in rabbit eyes after 28 days of treatment with
any of the three f 2alpha prostaglandin analogs
( xxxd3274xxx ,  xxxd2446xxx , or  xxxd3414xxx ). 24
using laser speckle flowgraphy, the effect
of  xxxd3274xxx  (+11.9%) on blood flow was
significantly greater than that seen with
 xxxd3414xxx  (+6.7%, p=0.037) and tended to be
greater than that seen with  xxxd2446xxx  (+7.2%,
p=0.086) at 60 min on day 28 post treatment.24
dong et al. found that  xxxd3274xxx  induced
concentration-dependent relaxation of
precontracted isolated rabbit ciliary arteries,
but by a mechanism that was independent
of endothelial-derived factor.25 they showed
that the  xxxd3274xxx -induced relaxation might
be due, at least in part, to an inhibition of
the capacitative entry of extracellular ca 2+.
an improvement in blood flow was
demonstrated with pgf2alpha analogs in a rabbit
model of disturbed blood flow induced by
administration of  xxxg674xxx  (et-1) into
the vitreous.26  xxxd3274xxx  had a longer-lasting
inhibition of the et-1-induced impairment of
onh blood flow than the three 15-hydroxyltype pgf2alpha analogs tested (15-oh  xxxd3274xxx ,
 xxxd3414xxx , and  xxxd2446xxx ).
the authors speculate that these in vivo
results were due to the di-fluorine at the
carbon 15 position of  xxxd3274xxx . the fluorine
moiety imparts resistance to oxidation by the
15-hydroxyl prostaglandin dehydrogenase
present in the onh and blood, therefore making
its observed inhibitory effect more prolonged
than those of the 15-hydroxyl-type pgf2alpha analogs.
 xxxd3274xxx  also increased onh blood flow in both
normal and experimental glaucomatous eyes in
monkeys.27 however, at this time we do not have
sufficient means of reliably and reproducibly

710

measuring blood flow in human eyes and the
potential beneficial role of ocular blood flow
improvement by pg derivatives, including
 xxxd3274xxx , should be verified in the future.
there is evidence that  xxxd3274xxx  has some
neuroprotective action as well. kanamori
et al. identified a direct antiapoptotic effect of
 xxxd3274xxx  on cultured retinal ganglion cells
and rat retinal ganglion cells after optic nerve
crush. 28 for the in vitro model, where retinal
ganglion cell apoptosis was induced by serumremoval or by glutamate exposure,  xxxd3274xxx 
suppressed apoptosis in a dose-dependent
manner, significantly reducing the number of
 xxxg341xxx -positive cells (p<0.05) and suppressing
intracellular ca2+ levels evoked by exogenous
glutamate. for the in vivo rat model of optic
nerve crush,  xxxd3274xxx  increased the survival rate
of ganglion cells in eyes treated for 14 days after
optic nerve crush (p=0.01).28 in a more recent
study, commercially available preservative-free
 xxxd3274xxx  was applied directly onto the surface
of a rat retinal explant culture.29 the authors
noted a reduction of both neuronal and total
cell loss from the retinal ganglion cell layer at
4 days ex vivo, compared to controls, although
no effect was found after 1 week.29
one of the known adverse reactions to pg
derivatives is pigmentation of the iris and/
or eyelids. work by takagi et al. analyzed the
potential melanogenesis effect of  xxxd3274xxx  in
vitro.6 melanoma cells that had been incubated
for 4 days in a medium supplemented with
a high concentration of  xxxd3274xxx  failed to
exhibit the elevated melanin content seen in
cultures containing the same concentration
of  xxxd2446xxx . 6 the lack of reaction in the
 xxxd3274xxx -treated cells, despite the presence
of such a reaction in the  xxxd2446xxx -treated
cells, may indicate that the incidence of iris
or eyelid pigmentation will be lower with
 xxxd3274xxx , and if present, it will not be severe.

perhaps the most distinguishing feature of
 xxxd3274xxx  is that it is the first preservativefree pga formulation. it has been speculated
that removal of benzalkonium chloride (bac),
which helps in corneal penetration of less
lipophilic medications, would reduce intraocular
delivery, and therefore effectiveness. 30,31
however, the removal of bac did not affect
corneal penetration of preservative-free
 xxxd3274xxx  in rabbits.32 after the administration
of a single topical dose (30 µl), the maximum
concentrations at 45 minutes of  xxxd3274xxx 
acid in aqueous humor were 4.50 ng/ml
for preservative-free  xxxd3274xxx  and 3.99 ng/ml
for preserved  xxxd3274xxx . this may be due to
the fact that  xxxd3274xxx  is a lipophilic prodrug
ester with inherently high corneal permeability.
in vivo and in vitro studies have shown that
the preservative-free  xxxd3274xxx  causes less
conjunctival damage than the preserved pg.33,34
in a conjunctival cell line, the application
of preservative-free  xxxd3274xxx  showed
significantly higher membrane integrity
and lower pro-apoptotic and pro-oxidative
effects compared to preserved  xxxd2446xxx ,
 xxxd3414xxx , or  xxxd340xxx . 33 liang et al.
assessed conjunctival and corneal reactions
to preservative-free  xxxd3274xxx , commercially
available  xxxd2446xxx , and bac 0.02% following
repeated applications to rabbits in vivo. 34
they found that both the preserved  xxxd2446xxx  and
bac induced greater expression of inflammatory
markers and caused more ocular surface toxicity
than the preservative-free  xxxd3274xxx .

 xxxd3274xxx  efficacy and
safety - clinical studies
the pharmacodynamics, safety, and tolerability
of  xxxd3274xxx  were assessed in two placebocontrolled phase i clinical trials. 8,9 in the
first phase i study,  xxxd3274xxx  0.0025% and

adv ther (2011) 28(9):707-715.

0.005%,  xxxd2446xxx  0.005%, and placebo were
administered to healthy volunteers for 7 days.
the decline in iop from baseline was 4.3 mmhg
for  xxxd3274xxx  0.0025%, 6.8 mmhg for  xxxd3274xxx 
0.005%, 5.3 mmhg for  xxxd2446xxx , and
3.1 mmhg for placebo. the decrease in iop
values compared to baseline was significant
for all treatment groups, and superior with
 xxxd3274xxx  0.005% compared with placebo, and
for several time-points with  xxxd3274xxx  0.005%,
compared with  xxxd2446xxx .8
in the second placebo-controlled phase i study,
healthy volunteers were given sequential increasing
doses of  xxxd3274xxx , ie, 0.0001%, 0.0005%, 0.0025%,
and 0.005%. for all doses, iop reduction was
present as compared with placebo. the effect was
dose-dependent and significant for concentrations
of 0.0005%, 0.0025%, and 0.005%. the effect
was maximal at 12 hours after administration
and lasted throughout the duration of treatment
(2 days).9 after a subsequent dose-response
phase ii trial in japan, the therapeutic concentration
of  xxxd3274xxx  was set at 0.0015%, which was not
used in phase i studies.11 the systemic safety
was similar for  xxxd3274xxx ,  xxxd2446xxx , and
placebo when administered topically. 8,9 the
investigators did not observe clinically significant
changes in laboratory parameters, vital signs, or
electrocardiographic parameters in any of the
49 participants throughout the course of the first
phase i study.
the most common ocular side effect
was ocular hyperemia. this was more
frequent after administration of  xxxd3274xxx  in
concentrations of 0.0025% or 0.005% than
after administration of  xxxd2446xxx  0.005%.8
the incidence of photophobia was also
greater in the  xxxd3274xxx  group than in the
 xxxd2446xxx  group, however, this only occurred
at doses greater than the currently available
preparations, ie, 0.0015%. similar observations
were made in the second phase i study. 9

711

the authors stated that the overall rates of
adverse effects were similar for the  xxxd3274xxx 
0.0001%,  xxxd3274xxx  0.0025%, and  xxxd2446xxx 
0.005% groups, but rates of ocular hyperemia
was significantly lower in eyes receiving
 xxxd2446xxx . all adverse events described in the
first two phase i studies were mild to moderate
and did not result in treatment discontinuation.
in a third phase i study evaluating the
pharmacokinetics and efficacy of preserved
and preservative-free  xxxd3274xxx , uusitalo et
al. did not observe any significant differences
in pharmacokinetic parameters between the
formulations after single or repeated dosing.10
ocular hyperemia occurred with the same
frequency in both groups, but was predominantly
of moderate severity in eyes treated with
preserved  xxxd3274xxx , compared to only mild
severity with the preservative-free formulation.
the authors assessed the conjunctival hyperemia
using reference photographs and a five-step
scale; half steps were allowed to refine the scale.
in a randomized, double-masked, controlled,
multicenter, multinational phase ii study,
traverso et al. assessed the duration and stability
of the iop-lowering effect and tolerability of
 xxxd3274xxx  0.0015% compared with  xxxd2446xxx 
0.005% in patients with primary open-angle
glaucoma, exfoliation glaucoma, or ohtn. 35
the maximum reduction of iop was reached
by day 7 of treatment and sustained until
day 42. the  xxxd3274xxx  0.0015% decreased iop
9.7±3.3 mmhg from baseline, while  xxxd2446xxx 
0.005% lowered iop by 8.8±4.3 mmhg.
the overall treatment group difference was 0.17 mmhg
(95% ci −1.27-1.61; p=0.811).
the effect of  xxxd3274xxx  0.0015% on iop and
the safety of this medication were demonstrated
in a randomized, parallel-group, double-masked
european phase iii study conducted in 49 centers
in eight countries for up to 24 months.36 this
study compared the efficacy and safety profiles

712

of preserved  xxxd3274xxx  0.0015% and  xxxd2446xxx 
0.005% in 533 patients with oag, including
pigmentary and exfoliative glaucoma, and
ohtn. after 24 months, the mean decrease
in iop from baseline was 7.1 mmhg (29.1%)
in the group treated with  xxxd3274xxx  and
7.7 mmhg (32.2%) in the group treated with
 xxxd2446xxx . this difference was clinically
small (0.6 mmhg) and the noninferiority of
 xxxd3274xxx  to  xxxd2446xxx  over all diurnal iop
measurements was shown with analysis of
variance, and almost reached with analysis
of covariance (upper limits of the 95% ci 1.38
and 1.52 for the overall period, respectively).
the noninferiority limit was 1.5 mmhg.
both drugs were well tolerated. reported
adverse events were mild to moderate.
nonocular adverse events were reported in 133
(50.4%) patients treated with  xxxd3274xxx , and in
114 (43.2%) patients treated with  xxxd2446xxx .
of these, eleven participants in the  xxxd3274xxx 
group and nine in the  xxxd2446xxx  group
were considered to be related to treatment.
ocular adverse effects were reported by 48.1%
of patients in the  xxxd3274xxx  group and by
44.3% of patients in the  xxxd2446xxx  group.
the most frequently reported adverse effect
was conjunctival hyperemia. the stimulating
effect on eyelash growth was absent or mild
in 90% of patients after 24 months in both
the  xxxd3274xxx  and  xxxd2446xxx  groups. more
cases of iris pigmentation were reported in the
 xxxd2446xxx  group (28%) than in those treated
with  xxxd3274xxx  (26.1%), but these differences
were not significant.36
the diurnal iop-lowering efficacy and
safety of  xxxd3414xxx  0.004% and  xxxd3274xxx 
0.0015% in 48 patients with primary oag or
ohtn was compared in a randomized, doublemasked, active-controlled, crossover trial for
6 weeks with each medication.37 the 12-hour
mean diurnal iop was significantly lower with

adv ther (2011) 28(9):707-715.

 xxxd3414xxx  than with  xxxd3274xxx  (16.9 mmhg
versus 17.5 mmhg, respectively; p=0.01).
neither therapy produced a significant increase
from baseline in light sensitivity, blurred/
dim vision, stinging/burning, foreign body
sensation, or pain. hyperemia was increased
with both therapies (p≤0.01). investigatorobserved hyperemia was also significantly
increased from baseline for both  xxxd3414xxx 
(0.26±0.56, p<0.01) and  xxxd3274xxx  (0.42±0.54,
p<0.01), although the increase with  xxxd3414xxx 
therapy was significantly smaller than with
 xxxd3274xxx  (p<0.01). 37 the study provided
only 6 weeks of treatment with each study
medication, thus it could not identify any
long-term efficacy and safety differences
between  xxxd3414xxx  and  xxxd3274xxx .
the efficacy and safety profile of preserved
and preservative-free  xxxd3274xxx  was also
compared in a phase iii crossover study.7 in this
group of 43 patients with oag, the authors
showed that both formulations demonstrated
a clear reduction of iop within 1 week, which
was sustained at week 4. the overall difference
between the two formulations was not
statistically significant.
the preservative free formulation of
 xxxd3274xxx  appears to be a good alternative for
patients exhibiting ocular surface side effects
while receiving other pg formulations. in an
effort to evaluate this, uusitalo et al. investigated
the hypotensive effect and tolerability of
preservative-free  xxxd3274xxx  in 158 patients
with oag and ohtn who were exhibiting
ocular surface side effects during  xxxd2446xxx 
treatment. 38 twelve weeks after switching
from preserved  xxxd2446xxx  to preservativefree  xxxd3274xxx , iop remained at the same level.
mean iop values were 16.8±2.5 mmhg at
baseline on  xxxd2446xxx , and 16.2±2.4 mmhg,
16.4±2.5 mmhg, 16.4±2.7 mmhg at 2, 6, and
12 weeks of treatment with preservative-free

adv ther (2011) 28(9):707-715.

 xxxd3274xxx , respectively. compared to baseline,
the iop levels were similar, but statistically
significantly lower during treatment with
preservative-free  xxxd3274xxx  (p=0.002; 0.018, and
0.049, respectively). the number of patients
with objective ocular side effects (conjunctival
hyperemia, corneal, and conjunctival fluorescein
staining, etc.) was reduced by approximately
50% after switching the drugs. the same was
reported for ocular symptoms including itching,
tearing, irritation, burning, stinging, and foreign
body sensation. after 12 weeks of  xxxd3274xxx 
preservative-free treatment, fluorescein break-up
time increased from 4.5±2.5 seconds at baseline
to 7.8±4.9 seconds (p<0.001).
results of impression cytology samples
revealed there was a statistically significant
reduction of abnormal conjunctival cells based
on hla-dr and mucin-5ac expression. these
observations may indicate a less harmful impact
of preservative-free  xxxd3274xxx  on the conjunctiva
than preserved  xxxd2446xxx . furthermore, in a
multicenter, observational, open-label study of
544 glaucoma patients, hommer et al. showed
that preservative-free  xxxd3274xxx  provided further
iop reduction in patients with poor iop control
and/or poor tolerance of their medication
prior to  xxxd3274xxx  use. 39 iop reduction was
achieved for patients being switched from other
monotherapies, including beta-blockers, carbonic
anhydrase inhibitors, and other pga to a
monotherapy with preservative-free  xxxd3274xxx .
patients also demonstrated a decrease in signs
and symptoms of ocular side effects.39
in a recent prospective, multicenter,
noninterventional, observational, open-label
study conducted in germany between july 2009
and february 2010, patients with glaucoma or
ohtn were followed after switching to oncedaily therapy with preservative-free  xxxd3274xxx 
0.0015%. patients were selected once investigators
determined a need for a change of medication, an

713

add-on therapy, or who were treatment naïve.
subjects were then followed for 6 to 12 weeks
after they were switched to once-daily therapy
with preservative-free  xxxd3274xxx  0.0015%.
at the final visit of 6 to 12 weeks, the mean
iop value for all patients was significantly
lowered from 19.5±4.4 mmhg at baseline to
16.4±2.9 mmhg on  xxxd3274xxx  (p<0.001).
preservative-free  xxxd3274xxx  also significantly
lowered iop in all monotherapy subgroups
including beta blockers (n=307), carbonic
anhydrase inhibitors (n=158), pga (n=447),
and treatment-naïve patients (n=440).
at baseline, tolerability of the prior treatment
was rated as “very good” and “good” by 28.3%
of the patients; 38.4% of patients had rated the
tolerability as “less satisfactory,” and 18% as “not
acceptable.” the tolerability had improved after
the change to preservative-free  xxxd3274xxx  with a
total of 85.7% of patients rating the tolerability
as “very good” and “good.”40 the observed iop
reduction in these observational open-label studies
may be a result of increased compliance due to
the improvement of the subjective symptoms and
clinical signs. also, regression to the mean cannot
be ruled out since a control group was not used.

conclusion
 xxxd3274xxx  appears to be a promising new
alternative in the treatment of glaucoma.
clinical trials have demonstrated good iop
lowering efficacy and safety profile of this
novel agent. the available preservative-free
formulation appears to provide an effective
alternative to patients intolerant of preserved
pga or other medications, by decreasing signs
and symptoms of ocular side effects. further
studies are needed to confirm  xxxd3274xxx ’s
efficacy and tolerability in clinical practice and
establish its role among other pgas available
for the treatment of glaucoma.
