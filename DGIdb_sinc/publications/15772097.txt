in the mouse, neurotransmitter metabolism can be regulated by modulation of the synthesis of pyridoxal
50 -phosphate and failure to maintain  xxxd3047xxx  (plp) levels results in epilepsy. this study of
five patients with neonatal epileptic encephalopathy suggests that the same is true in man. cerebrospinal
fluid and urine analyses indicated reduced activity of aromatic l -amino acid decarboxylase and other plpdependent enzymes. seizures ceased with the administration of plp, having been resistant to treatment
with pyridoxine, suggesting a defect of pyridox(am)ine 50 -phosphate oxidase ( xxxg1793xxx ). sequencing of the
 xxxg1793xxx  gene identified homozygous missense, splice site and stop codon mutations. expression studies in
chinese hamster ovary cells showed that the splice site (ivs3-1g > a) and stop codon (x262q) mutations
were null activity mutations and that the missense mutation (r229w) markedly reduced pyridox(am)ine
phosphate oxidase activity. maintenance of optimal plp levels in the brain may be important in many neurological disorders in which neurotransmitter metabolism is disturbed (either as a primary or as a secondary
phenomenon).

introduction
the main feature of neonatal epileptic encephalopathy (nee)
is the onset within hours of birth of a severe seizure disorder
that does not respond to anticonvulsant drugs and can be
fatal. some patients with nee have shown biochemical
changes in the cerebrospinal fluid (csf) and urine that indicate reduced activity of aromatic l -amino acid decarboxylase
( xxxg618xxx ) (1,2). these include (i) build up of metabolites of
l -3,4- xxxd2471xxx  (l-dopa) [including a markedly elevated csf concentration of 3-methoxytyrosine and
increased urinary excretion of vanillactic acid (vla)] and
(ii) decreased csf concentrations of the dopamine metabolite,
homovanillic acid (hva), and the serotonin metabolite,

5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-hiaa) (3 –5). however, the
reported patients with nee had additional biochemical
changes in the csf (raised concentrations of glycine and threonine) (1,2) that were most easily explained by cellular deficiency
of  xxxd3047xxx  (plp), the co-factor for  xxxg618xxx , threonine dehydratase and the glycine cleavage enzyme. treatment
with plp stopped the seizures where pyridoxine treatment had
failed (2). this suggested a defect in an enzyme required for
the synthesis of intracellular plp from dietary pyridoxine
(but not from pyridoxal/plp—pyridox(am)ine 50 -phosphate
oxidase ( xxxg1793xxx ) deficiency.
the human  xxxg1793xxx  gene (omim 6032870) is situated on
chromosome 17q21.2 and extends 7.5 kb (6). it contains
seven exons and produces an mrna transcript of 2.4 kb that

 xxxg1793xxx  in five patients with biochemistry suggestive of
 xxxg1793xxx  deficiency and have identified homozygous missense,
splice site and stop codon mutations all of which markedly
reduced  xxxg1793xxx  activity when expressed in chinese hamster

patient details are summarized in tables 1 and 2. additional
features are given below.

family j. the parents were of east african asian origin and
were second cousins (2). they had difficulty in conceiving
and had two unsuccessful attempts at ivf and one miscarriage. their two live-born children were both conceived
naturally: j1: a daughter was born at 33 weeks gestation by
emergency caesarean section for fetal distress. she had
apgar scores of 6 (1 min) and 7 (5 min) and a metabolic
acidosis on day 1. onset of seizures was at 2 h; a computed

family g. the parents were first cousins of turkish origin and
they lost at least four (and possibly six) children from nee
(1). g1: the first child was born at 32 weeks gestation and
died at 21 days. this infant was thought to have non-ketotic
hyperglycinaemia (nkh) on the basis of seizures plus elevated plasma and csf glycine, but threonine concentrations
were also elevated. g2, g3, g4: triplets, conceived by in
vitro fertilization (ivf) and born at 24 weeks; two died after
1 day and one survived longer. this child had elevated
plasma glycine and threonine concentrations, severe feeding
problems and intestinal obstruction; surgical exploration
showed malrotation and volvulus. she also had recurrent
anaemia requiring transfusion. she had treatment-resistant epilepsy from 2 weeks and also developed progressive microcephaly. she died at 6 months of her epilepsy plus
symptoms of ileus and severe failure to thrive (1.56 kg). g5,
g6: twins boys conceived by ivf and born at 29 weeks
following premature labour. both were in poor condition at
birth, required intubation and ventilation and had a (compensated) metabolic acidosis on day 1 (e.g. g5: ph 7.36, pco2,
3.2 kpa, base excess (be) – 10 mmol/l). from birth, they had
severe convulsions, myoclonus, rotatory eye movements and
sudden clonic contractions. the electroencephalogram
(eeg) showed a burst suppression (bs) pattern and biochemical investigations revealed episodes of hypoglycaemia and
also intermittent acidosis. the lactate concentrations in
blood, csf and urine were moderately elevated (e.g. g5:
csf lactate 3.2 mmol/l), and alanine concentrations were
normal. the severe epilepsy was resistant to conventional
anticonvulsant therapy. treatment with pyridoxine led to a
partial improvement of clonic contractions and lip-smacking
automatisms. however, severe seizure activity continued and
the infants died at the ages of 17 and 19 days, respectively.
g7: the parents requested prenatal diagnosis for the next
pregnancy. dna analysis from the chorionic villus indicated
that the foetus was affected (homozygous for the r229w
mutation) and they requested the termination of pregnancy.

tomography (ct) scan of the brain was interpreted as
showing bilateral ischaemic changes in the basal ganglia.
the seizures were never fully controlled and she had
additional problems with anaemia and with abdominal distension and vomiting and she died aged 5 weeks. j2: a son
was born at 35 weeks gestation by emergency caesarean
section for fetal distress (abnormal cardiotocogram (ctg)
trace and meconium-stained liquor). birth weight was
2.12 kg and apgar scores 7 (1 min) and 8 (5 min). he developed signs of respiratory distress and required ventilation for
12 h; blood gas analysis revealed a profound metabolic acidosis (ph 7.09, be –19 mmol/l) and he was also anaemic
(packed cell volume 28%). he improved with sodium bicarbonate therapy and transfusion but then started to develop
abnormal posturing, limb movements and mouth movements.
despite loading with  xxxd2908xxx , he developed further fits
and apnoea requiring re-intubation. examination of the
abdomen revealed a liver edge palpable 3 cm from the
costal margin and abdominal ultrasound confirmed hepatomegaly. a cranial ct showed an area of cerebral oedema in the
left parieto-occipital region and two eegs showed bs and
discontinuous patterns. the fits were now tonic – clonic with
mouthing and eye movements. for 2 days, the fits appeared
to be controlled by  xxxd2908xxx . however, between the
7th and 12th day of life, he developed further seizures and
eventually status epilepticus. the latter did not respond to
pyridoxine (50 mg twice daily) or to a midazolam infusion,
and he required  xxxd3354xxx  infusion and ventilation. by
now, the eeg showed a severe bs pattern with bursts consisting entirely of sharpened epileptiform activity. during the
initial period of acidosis, blood lactate was mildly elevated
(e.g. blood lactate 2.84 mm , lactate/pyruvate ratio 44) but subsequent determinations and csf lactate analysis were normal.
j2 was given 50 mg of plp (solgar) via his nasogastric
tube. one hour later the seizures had stopped, but he had
become extremely hypotonic and apnoeic with no response
to pain. an eeg showed prolonged isoelectric periods with
only transient responses to auditory stimulation. (these
phenomena are similar to those seen during treatment of a
neonate with pyridoxine-dependent epilepsy.) treatment
with plp was continued at a dose of 10 mg/kg 6-hourly.
the infant remained akinetic and unresponsive for 4 days
(during which he had a period of hypotension requiring
colloid and dopamine infusion). thereafter, there was a
steady improvement in both clinical status and eeg. two
weeks after starting plp therapy and while still on vigabatrin
as anticonvulsant, the infant had two further seizures and the
dose of plp was increased to 15 mg/kg 6-hourly. repeat analyses of csf were undertaken when j2 was receiving plp
therapy: the 3-methoxytyrosine concentration had fallen
to within the normal range, the hva had risen to within the
normal range and the 5-hiaa had risen to just below
the normal range. the csf glycine concentration had fallen
to normal, and concentrations of threonine, taurine and
histidine remained elevated.
j2 was the only patient in this series to receive plp treatment and only he survived beyond the neonatal period. unfortunately, he showed persistent central hypotonia and by the
second year of life severe painful dystonic spasms as well as
some seizures. he had marked acquired microcephaly and

development.

family k. the parents were of asian origin and consanguineous. k1 was the first child, born at 32 weeks gestation,
weighing 2.08 kg and with apgar scores of 10 (1 and
5 min). she developed intractable seizures from 30 min;
these were refractory to phenytoin,  xxxd2908xxx , clonazepam,  xxxd2482xxx , paraldehyde and piracetam. pyridoxine,
100 mg twice daily, also failed to improve the seizures. the
eeg was consistent with severe myoclonic encephalopathy.
the infant was hypotonic but there was no organomegaly or
dysmorphism. on the third day of life, a metabolic acidosis
was noted (ph 7.05, pco2 5.2 kpa, be –20.1 mmol/l, hco3
13.3 mmol/l). she was sufficiently sick at this time to
require intubation and ventilation. she was extubated on the
10th day but again developed metabolic acidosis (ph 7.27,
pco2 3.9, po2 4.6, be –12 mmol/l, hco3 13.3 mmol/l,
lactate 1.4 mmol/l). weight gain remained poor in spite of
 xxxd3210xxx  and the infant died at 23 days.
blood lactate measurements had varied between 1.4 and
7.1 mmol/l, with the higher values being recorded when the
infant was most unwell. postmortem examination showed
milk aspiration and bronchopneumonia. the thymus was atrophied. the liver was congested and showed extramedullary
haemopoiesis. the kidneys showed proximal tubular necrosis.
the brain showed widespread changes including laminar
cortical and selective hippocampal damage. the degree of
astrocytosis suggested that brain damage was probably prenatal in onset. electron microscopy revealed unusual ‘fuzzy’
mitochondria in the myocardial tissue. k2, a sister of k1,
was born following the spontaneous onset of premature
labour at 29þ4 weeks gestation with a weight of 1.23 kg
and apgar scores of 1 at 9 min and 5  xxxd1891xxx  min. she developed
abnormal movements and a high-pitched cry within 30 min of
birth. continuous positive airway pressure (cpap) was
required for frequent apnoeas and full ventilation (with
minimal pressures and oxygen) was required from day
3. the seizures remained resistant to  xxxd2908xxx , phenytoin and clonazepam. intravenous pyridoxine, 200 mg daily,
was commenced without benefit. reasonable seizure control
was eventually achieved with a high-dose clonazepam infusion. the eeg showed a severe bs pattern, which continued
even when no seizures were evident clinically. pyridoxine
treatment, although not effective in seizure control, was
associated with a fall in 3-methoxytyrosine (from 2860 to
900 nmol/l) and a rise in 5-hiaa (from 151 to 299 nmol/l)
but no rise in csf hva or reduction in csf threonine. k2
became progressively less responsive, showing no spontaneous movements or spontaneous respiratory effort, and
she died at the age of 15 days. blood lactate levels had
varied between 1.8 (stable) and 7.0 mm (unwell). k3: when
the third pregnancy was diagnosed, the parents were offered
prenatal diagnosis on the basis that both their affected children
had been homozygous for mutations in the  xxxg1793xxx  gene
(x262q) and this was probably responsible for their fatal
epileptic encephalopathy. the foetus was shown to be homozygous normal and the pregnancy was continued. k3 was born
at term and is a female infant now 13 months old who has not

and

the affected infants in family g (1) were homozygous for a
missense mutation, r229w, affecting a highly conserved arginine residue (figs 1a, f and 2a). restriction enzyme studies
showed that the parents were heterozygous for the r229w
mutation (fig. 2a). this was not detected in 80 chromosomes
from control subjects of turkish origin (data not shown).
in family j (2), the propositus was homozygous for the
following variations (i) a missense mutation/polymorphism,
e50k, in a non-conserved region of the gene (figs 1b, f
and 2b) and (ii) a splice site mutation ivs3-1g.a (figs 1c
and 2c). the mrna in the patient’s fibroblasts lacked exon
4 (54 bases) (fig. 1e) confirming that the splice site mutation
causes aberrant splicing. a restriction enzyme test showed that
the parents were heterozygous for both mutations (fig. 2b and
c). these were not present in 114 control chromosomes of
subjects of asian origin (data not shown).
in family k, the propositus (k1) was homozygous for a stop
codon mutation (x262q) (figs 1d and 2d). restriction
enzyme studies showed that the affected sibling (k2) was
also homozygous for the stop codon mutation and that the
parents were heterozygotes (fig. 2d). prenatal diagnosis of a
further sibling (k3) indicated that neither allele carried the
stop codon mutation. the foetus was correctly predicted to
be unaffected. this mutation was not detected in 160 chromosomes from control subjects of asian origin (data not shown).
expression in mammalian cells
in vitro expression studies in cho cells showed that transfection with wild-type  xxxg1793xxx  produced readily measurable
activity, whereas transfection with dna containing the
r229w mutation resulted in a reduced level of  xxxg1793xxx 
enzyme activity of 30% (21, 40%; n ¼ 2) of that of the
wild-type (table 3). transfection with dna containing the
x262q stop codon mutation produced undetectable activity
of  xxxg1793xxx . similarly, transfection of cho cells with a construct
containing the cdna of the fibroblasts of j2 engineered to
mimic the effects of the splice site mutation (i.e. deletion of
exon 4) plus e50k, produced no  xxxg1793xxx  activity (table 3).
however, when the dna contained e50k only,  xxxg1793xxx  activity
in the transfected cells was similar to that in cells transfected
with wild-type dna (128, 143%; n ¼ 2) (table 3). it was
concluded that the splice site mutation was the pathogenic
mutation in j2.

discussion
dietary  xxxd3049xxx  enters the blood stream as pyridoxine,
pyridoxamine and pyridoxal. the conversion of pyridoxine
and pyridoxamine to the active co-factor, plp, requires
the activity of a kinase and then of  xxxg1793xxx ; synthesis of
active co-factor from dietary pyridoxal or plp requires the
kinase only (7).  xxxg1793xxx  probably also plays a role in a
salvage pathway recycling the co-factor from degraded

to be the same as that in the liver and other non-neural cells
(8). in 2003, musayev et al. (8) cloned the cdna encoding
human  xxxg1793xxx , expressed it in escherichia coli and studied

the properties of the recombinant enzyme. they showed that
the three-dimensional folding of the human  xxxg1793xxx  is very
similar to those of the e. coli and yeast enzymes. furthermore, the binding sites for the substrate and for the flavine

mononucleotide (fmn) co-factor are highly conserved
between the human and e. coli enzymes. recently, kang
et al. (6) reported on the genomic organization and tissue distribution of human  xxxg1793xxx . they pointed out that the  xxxg1793xxx 
gene had the characteristics of a housekeeping gene: absence
of tata-like sequences, presence of sp1-binding sites and
more importantly, the presence of cpg islands in the regulatory region.
it has long been known that dietary deficiency of vitamin
b6 can produce (i) biochemical changes suggestive of plp
deficiency (including raised plasma concentration and
urinary excretion of threonine and glycine) (9) and (ii) seizures in young infants (10). recent work in the mouse
suggests that circadian control of enzyme activities in the
brain and peripheral tissues may be achieved through regulation of tissue concentrations of plp.  xxxg1720xxx  is activated by three circadian par bzip transcription factors which
are in turn activated by bmal1 and clock (the members of
the positive limb of the circadian oscillator) and repressed by
cry and per proteins (the members of the negative limb).

when all three par bzip transcription factors are knocked
out, mice show deranged neurotransmitter metabolism and
severe epilepsy (11). in the liver, gluconeogenesis is abolished
by the deletion of bmal1 and depressed by the mutation of
clock (12). the study of inborn errors affecting plp synthesis
will provide a unique opportunity for studying the role of plp
as a regulator of enzyme activities in man.
all five patients with biochemical results suggestive of
 xxxg1793xxx  deficiency had mutations in the  xxxg1793xxx  gene which
could be expected to result in reduced enzyme activity, and
all of these mutations were shown by expression studies to
reduce or abolish enzyme activity. affected infants in family
g had a mutation of arg229, the last amino acid in the
sequence rlhdr (residues 225 – 229 in the human gene)
which is completely conserved in all species examined. structural studies of recombinant human  xxxg1793xxx  have shown that
arg229 residue is one of many amino acids that help to
bind fmn tightly to the active site of  xxxg1793xxx  (8). substitution
of arg with trp (r229w) would be predicted to disrupt
this interaction and that of other amino acids in the vicinity.

30 -utr, which are required for mrna stability. this phenomenon is seen in chain termination mutations of the a2 globin
gene. seven single-nucleotide variants of the natural termination codon of the a2 globin gene have been reported which
result in a thalassemia (14). mutation of the stop codon of
the a chain of haemoglobin enables mrna translation to
continue to the next in-phase termination codon located
within the polyadenylation signal and extends the a chain
by 31 amino acids. studies have shown that the mrna of
the most extensively studied variant of this group (chain termination mutants), hbconstant spring, is unstable because
of disruption of a putative rna/protein complex associated
with the a2 globin 30 -utr which is required for mrna
stability in erythroid cells (15). expression studies confirmed
that x262q  xxxg1793xxx  was a null activity mutant (table 3).
having confirmed that all five patients had mutations in the
 xxxg1793xxx  gene that reduce the activity of the enzyme, we can
now review the phenotype of  xxxg1793xxx  deficiency (tables 1
and 2). all the patients were born prematurely and all but
one had low apgar scores and/or required intubation. early
acidosis was also common. thus,  xxxg1793xxx -deficiency must
enter the differential diagnosis of hypoxic-ischaemic encephalopathy (hie) in a prematurely born infant. further work is
needed to determine whether a simple non-invasive test such
as urinary organic acids (vanillactate) can be used to screen
neonates diagnosed as having hie for  xxxg1793xxx  deficiency. seizures commenced on the first day of life and were associated
with an eeg showing a bs pattern.  xxxg1793xxx  deficiency must,
therefore, figure in the differential diagnosis of ohtahara syndrome and nkh. fortunately, it would appear that the csf
glycine/plasma glycine ratio in  xxxg1793xxx  deficiency is not as
high as it is in nkh and, of course, the other amino acid,
and neurotransmitter amine metabolite abnormalities are not
seen in nkh. an eeg showing bs is usually considered an
indicator of severe cortical dysfunction—the eeg is flat
apart from the intermittent seizure activity. our results
indicate that bs cannot be considered a marker of irreversible
cortical damage. as it is frequently seen in nkh as well as in
 xxxg1793xxx  deficiency, it may sometimes be a marker of an
elevated glycine concentration in the brain: in  xxxg1793xxx 
deficiency, this is reversible.
the biochemical abnormalities in the csf and urine were as
for  xxxg618xxx  deficiency with the additional features of raised

the immediately adjacent asp228 is involved in one of two
pairs of intersubunit salt – bridge interactions, interacting
with arg181. this is conserved in the yeast, e. coli and
human  xxxg1793xxx  structures (8). in addition, in e. coli invariant
residues arg197 and his199 (which are the equivalent of
arg225 and his227 in human  xxxg1793xxx ) are found in the flexible
turn located between the strands s6 and s7 and directly
interact with plp at the active site (13). these two residues
act as a clamp on plp sandwiching the pyridine moiety
onto the isoalloxazine ring of fmn while catalysis takes
place (13). the expression studies in cho cells confirmed
the importance of arg229 for the activity of  xxxg1793xxx  with the
substitution of arg with trp (r229w) markedly reducing
the activity of  xxxg1793xxx  (table 3).
affected infants in family j had two  xxxg1793xxx  sequence variations (ivs3-1g.a and e50k). expression studies with the
construct engineered to contain both the splice site mutation
and the e50k confirmed the mutant  xxxg1793xxx  was not active
(table 3). we considered that e50k was more likely to be a
polymorphism than a pathogenic mutation. it is not conserved
across species and characterization of the roles of the n- and
c-terminal regions of human  xxxg1793xxx  has shown that deletion
of the n-terminal 56 residues affects neither the binding of
coenzyme nor catalytic activity (6). expression studies of
e50k alone confirmed that the substitution of glu with lys at
this position did not have a deleterious effect on enzyme activity
and hence is a polymorphism. indeed, it appears that the mutant
e50k  xxxg1793xxx  is slightly more active than the wild-type
 xxxg1793xxx  (table 3). therefore, it can be concluded that the pathogenic mutation in this patient is the splice site mutation,
ivs3-1g.a, which was predicted to result in the loss of exon
4. studies of the mrna in cultured skin fibroblasts confirmed
the deletion of exon 4. if translated, this would produce a
protein lacking amino acids 122– 139. the complete loss of
b-sheet 4 and parts of a-helix 2 and b-sheet 5 (8) could be
expected to have a major effect on the tertiary structure of
 xxxg1793xxx . the deletion would also remove arg138 and gln139
which are involved in binding fmn (8).
the abolition of the stop codon (x262q) would be predicted to cause a c-terminal 28 amino acid extension
(fig. 1f), which may disrupt the dimeric structure and
therefore the activity of the enzyme. in addition, translational
readthrough may disrupt determinants associated with the

the csf plp had normalized but only at the expense of a
35-fold increase in the csf level of pyridoxal.
the family histories of our patients suggest that parents
heterozygous for  xxxg1793xxx  deficiency have reduced rates of
conception and perhaps also an incidence of homozygous
affected pregnancies higher than the expected one in four.
there are three observations that may be of relevance here.
first, it is known that high doses of pyridoxine are toxic to
the testis and spermatozoa (although the mechanism is not
understood) (19). secondly, both testis and spermatozoa
express a unique transcript of the  xxxg1720xxx  gene (20)
(the translation product of which can probably convert pyridoxine to pyridoxine-50 -phosphate, one of the substrates for
 xxxg1793xxx ). thirdly, rats given pyridoxine show increased rates
of implantation and an increased number of live births but at
high doses, a reduction in the body weight of the pups (21).
in summary, mutations in the  xxxg1793xxx  gene resulting in
reduced  xxxg1793xxx  activity are responsible for ‘nee mimicking
aromatic amino acid decarboxylase deficiency’ and for ‘pyridoxine-resistant, plp-sensitive seizures’. the biochemical
phenotype of  xxxg1793xxx  deficiency is complex but the observed
abnormalities in the csf and urine can largely be explained
by defects in specific plp-dependent enzymes. these effects
are important, not only for the management of this disorder
but also for our understanding of (i) how plp homoeostasis
prevents epilepsy and (ii) how the biochemical activity of
the brain and liver can be regulated by variation in plp
levels (e.g. in their circadian rhythms). finally, our findings
have implications for the treatment of epilepsy. plp has
been used successfully in japan in the treatment of a range
of epilepsies from infantile spasms to status epilepticus in an
adult (22 – 24); neurologists in the west need to look anew at
its role.

genomic dna was extracted from venous blood by a modified version of the ammonium acetate salting out method
(25,26). in the case of k1, genomic dna was extracted
from samples of occipital lobe, liver and muscle obtained at
postmortem and stored frozen. the 7 exons and intron/exon
boundaries of the  xxxg1793xxx  gene were amplified by pcr using
intronic primers (supplementary material, table s1). a
typical pcr reaction using 100 ng of genomic dna contained
25 pmol of each primer, 1  nh4 reaction buffer (bioline ltd,
london, uk), 0.2 mmol/l dntps and 0.5 ml (2.5 units) biopro
dna polymerase (bioline ltd) (added after a ‘hot start’).

glycine (in all five), threonine (4/5), taurine (4/5), histidine (5/
5) and low arginine (3/5). these could all be explained by
reduced activities of specific plp-dependent enzymes.
glycine, threonine and histidine are catabolized by
plp-dependent enzymes. one possible explanation for an
elevated taurine concentration can be derived from the consideration of the pathway for taurine synthesis. taurine is
synthesised from cysteine via cysteine sulphinate. cysteine
sulphinate has two possible metabolic fates; it can be converted to pyruvate and sulphite by a plp-dependent aspartate
aminotransferase or converted via a plp-dependent decarboxylase to hypotaurine (and hence to taurine). the aminotransferase reaction involves the conversion of enzyme-bound plp
to pyridoxamine-phosphate (at least in e. coli ) (16). thus, this
enzyme (like threonine dehydratase) might be particularly
susceptible to deficiency of the enzyme required to convert
pyridoxamine-phosphate back to plp. thus,  xxxg1793xxx  deficiency
might favour the conversion of cysteine sulphinate to taurine.
another possibility is that raised csf taurine is merely a
reflection of cell damage as taurine is present at high concentrations inside cells. the three patients with low csf arginine
also had low plasma arginine suggesting that this was the
cause.
concentrations of amino acids in plasma were highly
variable, depending on dietary protein/intravenous amino
acid intake. most of the samples were taken when protein
intake was low and showed normal/elevated glycine and
threonine and low arginine. the low arginine in plasma and
secondarily in csf was probably due to reduced synthesis
from proline and glutamate via d1-pyrroline 5-carboxylate
( xxxg1905xxx ) and ornithine due to reduced activity of ornithine
d-aminotransferase (oat). in the neonate (in contrast to the
adult), oat activity is orientated towards ornithine and
arginine synthesis (17).
an elevated blood lactate was documented at one time or
another in all five patients. the significance of this is difficult
to interpret in such sick infants; levels were not sufficiently
high to be the main cause of marked acidosis when it occurred.
hypoglycaemia may have been in part attributable to the
disordered glucose homeostasis that occurs in sick premature
infants (18). we had insufficient data on fuels and hormones
to determine whether impaired gluconeogenesis or glycogenolysis (secondary to the plp deficiency) might be a contributory factor.
measurement of plp and pyridoxal in frozen csf samples
from three of the infants showed all had low concentrations of
both these compounds. these results need to be interpreted
with caution as samples were taken when the patients were
having very frequent seizures and a poor oral intake of
 xxxd3049xxx . in order to answer the question of whether
 xxxg1793xxx  is required to recycle plp from pyridoxaminephosphate, we will need methods that can measure all the
b6 vitamers. plp given by nasogastric tube to j2 was dramatically effective in stopping the seizures and improving the
appearances of the eeg. when ingested in physiological
doses, plp is hydrolysed by intestinal phosphatase(s) prior
to absorption to pyridoxal. it is likely that the same occurs
with pharmacological doses of plp and that treatment with
pyridoxal would be equally effective. measurements made
when j2 was receiving 30 mg/kg/day of plp indicated that

cloning and generation of mutations by site-directed
mutagenesis
to facilitate expression vector construction, an eco ri recognition site was introduced at both ends of the  xxxg1793xxx  cdna by
pcr with primers shown in supplementary material,
table s1. the cdna was amplified using proofstart dna
polymerase (qiagen ltd, west sussex, uk) and the primers
described in supplementary material, table s1. pcr was
carried out for 50 cycles of 30 s at 948c (denaturation), 30 s at
658c (annealing) and 75 s at 728c. a final extension time of
10 min at 728c was used. the wild-type  xxxg1793xxx  cdna and
the  xxxg1793xxx  cdna of hj were cloned into the eco ri-restriction
site of the plasmid vector psp72 (promega, southampton,
uk). site-directed mutagenesis was carried out using the
quikchangew xl site-directed mutagenesis kit (stratagene,
la jolla, ca, usa), according to the manufacturer’s instructions. following mutagenesis, the  xxxg1793xxx  gene from one clone
was completely sequenced to confirm that no other errors had
been introduced into the cdna by the pcr-based procedure.
then, an eco ri digested fragment was subcloned into the
mammalian expression vector pires2 – enhanced green fluorescent protein (egfp) (bd biosciences clontech, palo alto,

ca, usa). correct orientation of the gene was confirmed by
digestion with apa i.

expression studies
cho cells were cultured in dulbecco’s modifed eagle’s
medium (dmem) (invitrogen ltd) supplemented with 10%
fetal bovine serum (sigma-aldrich, gillingham, dorset,
uk), 1% (v/v) penicillin/streptomycin (sigma-aldrich) and
2 mmol/l of l -glutamine (sigma-aldrich) at 378c in a 5%
(v/v) co2/air atmosphere. cells were transfected with wildtype or mutant cdna constructs using lipofectaminetm transfection agent (invitrogen ltd). experiments were carried out
in 175 cm2 flasks and 3.52  106 cells were seeded prior to
transfection. each construct was transfected using 14 mg of
dna and 88 ml lipofectamine. the transfection complexes
were removed 6 h after transfection and replaced with supplemented dmem as described previously. twenty-four
hours after transfection, the cells were visualized using an
inverted fluorescent microscope, and the efficiency of transfection was estimated by the number of cells expressing egfp.
cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline
(pbs) and harvested in 8 ml of pbs. cells were centrifuged
at 778g for 10 min and were resuspended in 100 ml cold
water. the lysates used for the protein and enzyme assays
were isolated from the cells by freezing (21508c) and
thawing (378c) three times. lysates were centrifuged at
16 000g for 5 min and the resulting supernatant represented
the crude cellular lysate.  xxxg1793xxx  enzyme activity was measured
with pyridoxamine 50 -phosphate as substrate using the
method described by kang et al. (6), but with the following
modifications: enzyme activity was measured by following
the formation of plp at 414 nm at 258c in 0.1 m tris– hcl
(ph 8.4) containing 0.1 mm pmp in a total volume of 1 ml.

measurement of pyridoxal and plp in csf
the concentration of pyridoxal and plp in csf was
determined using a chromsystems hplc kit (münchen,
