abstract
rationale second-generation antipsychotics have some beneficial effect on cognition. recent studies, furthermore,
indicate differential effects of second-generation antipsychotics on impairment in executive cognitive function.
objective we evaluated the effect of the second-generation
antipsychotic drug,  xxxd3195xxx , on extracellular levels of
dopamine (da), acetylcholine (ach), and glutamate (glu)
in the rat medial prefrontal cortex (mpfc). risperidone was
studied for comparison. moreover, selective serotonin 5ht2a, 5-ht2c, and  xxxg1119xxx  receptor antagonists were used,
given alone and in combination with the preferential da d2
receptor antagonist, haloperidol, to further clarify the action
of the two drugs.
materials and methods rats were treated acutely with
vehicle or drugs, and extracellular levels of neurotransmitters were assessed by microdialysis in freely moving
animals.
results  xxxd3195xxx  and risperidone significantly increased
extracellular levels of da. haloperidol; the 5-ht2a
receptor antagonist, m100907; the  xxxg1115xxx  antagonist, sb242084; and the  xxxg1119xxx  receptor antagonist, gsk742457, induced minor increases in levels of da, but the

three latter compounds raised the da levels notably in
combination with haloperidol.  xxxd3195xxx  and risperidone
significantly increased the extracellular levels of ach but
only  xxxd3195xxx  raised the extracellular levels of glu. the
selective  xxxg1119xxx  receptor antagonist, sb-271046, significantly increased the extracellular levels of glu.
conclusion  xxxd3195xxx  and risperidone markedly increased extracellular levels of da in mpfc. the builtin 5-ht2a/5-ht2c/ xxxg656xxx  antagonism of the two
drugs might be involved in this action. both drugs
increased the extracellular levels of ach but only
 xxxd3195xxx  enhanced glu levels. the high affinity of
 xxxd3195xxx  for the  xxxg1119xxx  receptor compared to risperidone
may differentiate  xxxd3195xxx  from risperidone.

introduction
several lines of evidence suggest that current antipsychotics
have one common denominator regarding their mechanism
of action; they interfere with dopaminergic neurotransmission in the brain (arnt and skarsfeldt 1998). moreover,
current antipsychotics have the ability to block dopamine
(da) d2 receptors to a varying degree at therapeutically
relevant doses (talbot and laruelle 2002). while conventional  xxxg656xxx -blocking antipsychotics primarily have
clinical effect on positive symptoms of schizophrenia, the
second-generation antipsychotics, which have a broader
receptor profile, seem to have some beneficial effects on
negative symptoms and moderate effects on cognitive

40

deficits as well (meltzer and mcgurk 1999; o'grada and
dinan 2007; pratt et al. 2008; remington and kapur 2000).
the additional  xxxg1113xxx  antagonistic property of
some second-generation antipsychotics is assumed to be
involved in their therapeutic mechanism of action (wood et
al. 2006).
dopaminergic hypofunction in the prefrontal cortex
(pfc) has been suggested to be associated with the etiology
of negative symptoms and cognitive dysfunction of
schizophrenia (abi-dargham and moore 2003; stone et
al. 2007). the lack of ability of  xxxg656xxx  antagonism
alone to robustly mediate da neurotransmission in the pfc
(ago et al. 2005; kuroki et al. 1999; li et al. 2005) may be
implicated in the lack of effect of conventional antipsychotics on negative symptoms and cognitive dysfunction
(didriksen et al. 2007; grayson et al. 2007). in contrast,
second-generation antipsychotics have been reported to
produce increases in da levels in the medial prefrontal
cortex (mpfc; kuroki et al. 1999). kuroki et al. (1999)
suggested that the ability of some antipsychotics to produce
greater increases in extracellular levels of da in the mpfc
compared to the nucleus accumbens may in part be related
to weak  xxxg656xxx  affinity relative to  xxxg1113xxx 
antagonism. moreover,  xxxg1108xxx  agonism (ago et
al. 2005; bortolozzi et al. 2007) and  xxxg831xxx -adrenoceptor
antagonism (devoto et al. 2004) have been proposed to be
capable of releasing prefrontal da.
acetylcholine (ach) activity has been suggested to be of
significance for attention and various aspects of cognition
(gray and roth 2007). shirazi-southall et al. (2002)
demonstrated that the second-generation antipsychotics,
olanzapine and clozapine, markedly increased the levels
of ach in the rat hippocampus, leaving the conventional
antipsychotics, haloperidol, thioridazine, and chlorpromazine, with a very modest increase. furthermore, clozapine,
olanzapine, risperidone, and ziprasidone, but not haloperidol, sulpiride, and thioridazine, increased ach release in
the rat mpfc (ichikawa et al. 2002b). in the latter study,
none of the drugs affected the level of ach in the nucleus
accumbens or striatum. the multireceptor profile of the
second-generation antipsychotics is probably involved in
these ach effects, but so far it has not been possible to
clarify the mechanism of action (ichikawa et al. 2002a, c;
shirazi-southall et al. 2002).
as previously mentioned, dopaminergic hypofunction in
the pfc is thought to have a major role in the etiology of
negative symptoms and cognitive dysfunction of schizophrenia (abi-dargham and moore 2003; stone et al. 2007).
however, in humans, the n-methyl-d-aspartate (nmda)
receptor antagonists, phencyclidine (pcp) and ketamine,
induce psychotic symptoms and neurocognitive disturbances with similarities to those observed in schizophrenia
(enomoto et al. 2007; javitt 2007; krivoy et al. 2008; stone

psychopharmacology (2009) 206:39–49

et al. 2007; tan et al. 2007). thus, it has been hypothesized
that insufficient glutamate (glu) neurotransmission is
involved in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia. this
hypothesis has led to clinical trials with several positive
nmda modulators with encouraging findings (for review,
see javitt 2007). although single administration of an
nmda antagonist to rodents seems to reflect some facets
of schizophrenia (enomoto et al. 2007), withdrawal from
repeated nmda antagonist treatment reproduces
schizophrenia-like psychosis (positive/negative symptoms
and cognitive dysfunctions) and induces neurochemical and
neuroanatomical changes (abdul-monim et al. 2007;
cochran et al. 2003; enomoto et al. 2007; hajszan et al.
2006; noda et al. 2000). thus, the latter approach might be
a valuable animal model of schizophrenia. though single
injection with the nmda antagonist, mk-801, has been
reported to increase extracellular levels of glu in the mpfc
(lopez-gil et al. 2007; zuo et al. 2006), repeated
administration of mk-801 decreased glu levels in the
mpfc (zuo et al. 2006). interestingly,  xxxg1119xxx  antagonism
has been demonstrated to increase glu release in the rat
pfc (dawson et al. 2001).
second-generation antipsychotics may improve cognitive impairments in schizophrenic patients since
 xxxd3195xxx , risperidone, and clozapine, but not haloperidol, were observed to reverse cognitive deficits induced
by repeated pcp administration measured by the morris
water maze (didriksen et al. 2007). recent animal
studies indicate differential effects of second-generation
antipsychotics on impairment in executive cognitive
function, since  xxxd3195xxx  induced a significant reversal
of impairment in extradimensional set shifting, while
risperidone, olanzapine, and clozapine were ineffective
(goetghebeur and dias 2009; rodefer et al. 2008). the
latter differences may be associated with different receptor
profiles. as indicated in table 1,  xxxd3195xxx  and risperidone have a broad receptor profile with shared potent
antagonistic effects on the  xxxg656xxx  subfamily as well
as on the 5-ht2a, 5-ht2c, and the alpha1-adrenergic
receptors. moreover,  xxxd3195xxx  has high  xxxg1119xxx  receptor
affinity, while that of risperidone is negligible (arnt and
skarsfeldt 1998; leysen 2000).
in the present work, we studied the effects of
 xxxd3195xxx  on extracellular levels of neurotransmitters in
the brain. furthermore, the effects of risperidone and
haloperidol as well as selective antagonists of the 5ht2a, 5-ht2c, or  xxxg1119xxx  receptor on extracellular levels
of neurotransmitters in the rat mpfc were studied. the
drug doses chosen in these experiments were based on a
study demonstrating antipsychotic-like action in the
conditioned avoidance response model where drug effects
were related to plasma levels of drugs and  xxxg656xxx 
occupancy (olsen et al. 2008).

materials and methods
animals
male sprague–dawley rats (charles river), initially weighing 250 g, were used. the animals were housed two per
cage in makrolon cages (20 × 35 cm) with one plastic house
for enrichment. the animals were kept in an animal room at
room temperature under a 12-h light/dark cycle (lights on at
0600 hours). food and water were available ad libitum. the
rats had a minimum of 5 days adaptation in the animal
facility prior to the initiation of experiments and the
animals were brought to the experimental room the day
before the experiment. ethical permission for the procedures used in this study was granted by the animal welfare
committee, appointed by the danish ministry of justice
and all animal procedures were carried out in compliance
with ec directive 86/609/eec and with danish law
regulating experiments on animals.
compound administration
 xxxd3195xxx  (free base; h. lundbeck a/s) was dissolved in
isotonic water to which was added a small amount of acetic
acid and administered per os (p.o.) in a volume of 5 ml/kg.
risperidone (free base; jansen) and haloperidol (free base;
sigma) were dissolved in saline to which was added a small
amount of hcl and tartaric acid, respectively. m100907 (r
(+)-alpha-(2,3-dimethoxyphenyl)-1-[2-(4-fluorophenylethyl)4-piperdine-methanol]; free base; axon biochemicals

meditech), and sb-271046 (5-chloro-n-(4-methoxy-3piperazin-1-yl-phenyl)-3-methyl-2-benzothio-phenesulfonamide; hydrochloride; axon biochemicals bv) were
dissolved in 10% 2-hydroxypropyl-beta-cyclodextrin. risperidone, haloperidol, m100907, sb242084, and
gsk742457 were administered subcutaneously (s.c.) in
volumes of 2.5 ml/kg. sb-271046 was administered s.c.
in a volume of 5 ml/kg.
microdialysis
male sprague–dawley rats were anesthetized and intracerebral guide cannulas (cma/12) were stereotaxically implanted
into the brain positioning the dialysis probe tip in the mpfc
(coordinates=3.2 mm, anterior to bregma; 0.8 mm, lateral;
4.0 mm ventral to dura) or the nucleus accumbens (coordinates=1.7 mm, anterior to bregma; 0.7 mm, lateral; 8.0 mm
ventral to dura; paxinos and watson 1998). the microdialysis
probe (cma/12, 0.5 mm diameter, 2 or 3 mm length) was
inserted through the guide cannula and perfused with filtered
 xxxd3213xxx  solution (145 mm nacl, 3 mm kcl, 1 mm mgcl2,
and 1.2 mm cacl2 [+0.5 mum neostigmine for ach
measurements]) at a constant flow rate of 1 mul/min.
analysis of dialysate da
the content of da in the dialysates was analyzed by means of
high-performance liquid chromatography (hplc) with electrochemical detection. the monoamines were separated by
reverse-phase liquid chromatography (ods 150 × 2 mm
column). the mobile phase consisted of 150 mm nah2po4,
4.8 mm  xxxd1710xxx  monohydrate, 3 mm  xxxd3215xxx ,
50 mum ethylenediaminetetracetic acid, 11.3% methanol, and
16.7 % acetonitrile (ph5.6); flow rate of 0.2 ml/min.
electrochemical detection was accomplished using a coulo-

42

metric detector; potential was set at e2 = 200 mv (coulochem ii, esa). the lowest level of quantification was
0.5 fmol/20 mul.
analysis of dialysate glu
the content of glu in the dialysates was determined by means
of hplc with fluorescence detection after precolumn online
derivatization with o-phthalaldehyde (opa) using a fully
automated hplc fluorescence system (agilent 1100). the
reaction buffer was a 0.4 m boric acid buffer adjusted to ph
9.0 with naoh. using the autoinjector of the hplc system,
5 mul reaction buffer, 1 mul opa derivatization solution (opa;
10 mg/ml), and 1 mul microdialysis sample was mixed and
allowed to react for 2 min and thereafter injected onto the
hplc system. glu was separated on a  xxxd3100xxx  aa-ods
column (5 mum, 2.1 × 200 mm, agilent) with oven temperature
of 40°c. flow rate was 0.45 ml/min. mobile phase a
consisted of 20 mm sodium acetate, 0.018% triethylamine,
and 3% tetrahydrofuran (ph7.2). mobile phase b consisted of
20 mm sodium acetate, 40% acetonitrile, and 40% methanol.
a linear gradient was applied from 0 min (a/b = 100:0 v/v) to
7 min (a/b = 40:60 v/v) after which (from 8 min) elution was
carried out with mobile phase b alone. a 5 min reequilibration period was allowed between samples. the
agilent 1100 fluorescence detector was set to excitation at
340 nm and emission at 450 nm. the lowest level of
quantification was 100 fmol/µl.
analysis of dialysate ach
the content of ach in the dialysates was analyzed by means
of hplc with electrochemical detection using a mobile phase
consisting of 100 mm na2hpo4, 2.0 mm octane sulfonic
acid, 0.5 mm tetramethyl ammonium chloride, and 0.005%
mb (esa), ph8.0. a precolumn enzyme reactor (esa)
containing immobilized choline oxidase eliminated choline
from the injected sample (10 mul) prior to separation of ach
on the analytical column (esa ach-250); flow rate
0.35 ml/min, temperature 35°c. after the analytical column,
the sample passed through a postcolumn solid-phase reactor
(esa) containing immobilized acetylcholine esterase and
choline oxidase. the latter reactor converted ach to choline
and subsequently choline to betaine and h2o2. the latter was
detected electrochemically by using a platinum electrode;
potential was set at e1 = 300 mv (coulochem iii, esa, model
5040). the lowest level of quantification was 25 fmol/10 mul.
data presentation
the mean value of three consecutive dialysis samples
immediately preceding compound administration served as
the basal level for each experiment and data were converted to

percentage of basal (mean basal preinjection values normalized
to 100%). all data are presented as mean values ± sem. data
were analyzed by two-way analysis of variance followed by the
bonferroni post hoc test for between-groups multiple comparisons. data were evaluated by sigmastat version 3.0.1.

effects of  xxxd3195xxx  and risperidone on the level of da

administration of  xxxd3195xxx  (2.5 and 10 mg/kg p.o.; f2,286 =
42.60, p < 0.001) and risperidone (1 mg/kg s.c.; f1,100 =
133.24, p < 0.001) significantly increased extracellular levels
of da in the mpfc compared to vehicle-treated animals
(fig. 1a, b). moreover,  xxxd3195xxx  (2.5 and 10 mg/kg p.o.)
and risperidone (1 mg/kg s.c.) induced equivalent and
significant increases in the extracellular levels of da in the
nucleus accumbens (by 200% and 190%, respectively)
compared with their respective effects in the mpfc (data
not shown).

in dialysates from rat mpfc
the administration of haloperidol alone (0.5 mg/kg s.c.)
enhanced the da levels to a minor degree in the mpfc
(122 % at t = 60 min, normalizing the preinjection levels
to 100%) compared to vehicle-treated animals (f1,48 =
7.45, p = 0.009). m100907 (0.5 mg/kg s.c.; f1,40 = 7.4, p =
0.01) induced a minor but significant overall increase in
the da levels. sb242084 (0.5 mg/kg s.c.; f1,62 = 3.9, p =
0.052) also tended to increase the da levels when
administered alone (fig. 2a). gsk-742457 (1.25 mg/kg s.c.;
f1,84 = 8.06, p = 0.006) induced a slight but significant overall
increase in the da levels (fig. 2b). however, the combinations
of haloperidol plus m100907 (f1,63 = 31.58, p < 0.001),
sb242084 (f1,55 = 40.36, p < 0.001), or gsk742457 (f1,111 =
26.50, p > 0.001) induced robust increases in the extracellular
levels of da compared to that in vehicle-treated animals
(fig. 2a, b).

risperidone. accordingly, other second-generation antipsychotics have been reported to increase da levels in the
mpfc (bortolozzi et al. 2007; ichikawa et al. 2002a;
kuroki et al. 1999). the increase in extracellular levels of
da in the nucleus accumbens induced by  xxxd3195xxx  and
risperidone may primarily be due to blockade of presynaptic d2 receptors (westerink and de vries 1989), since d2/3
receptor affinities of antipsychotics correlate to their
preferential effects on da levels in the nucleus accumbens
(kuroki et al. 1999). the increase in mpfc da levels
induced by second-generation antipsychotics appears to
involve additional receptors giving the fact that most
prefrontal dopaminergic neurons do not possess d2 autoreceptors (lammel et al. 2008). in the present study,

levels (olsen et al. 2008) and induce behavioral effects in a
number of animal models of psychosis (arnt and skarsfeldt
1998). moreover, the risperidone dose has been used
frequently to study the effect on neurotransmitter systems
(kuroki et al. 1999; shirazi-southall et al. 2002).
as previously mentioned, both  xxxd3195xxx  and risperidone have a broad receptor profile with shared potent
effects on the  xxxg656xxx  subfamily as well as on the 5ht2a, 5-ht2c, and alpha1-adrenergic receptors (arnt and
skarsfeldt 1998). furthermore,  xxxd3195xxx  has high  xxxg1119xxx 
receptor affinity, while that of risperidone is negligible
(leysen 2000; table 1).
in this study, we demonstrated that acute treatment with
 xxxd3195xxx  increases the extracellular levels of da in the
mpfc and nucleus accumbens. this was also observed for

haloperidol induced a small increase in the da levels in the
mpfc in agreement with other observations (li et al. 2005;
liegeois et al. 2002).
serotonergic pathways seem to be of significance for the
regulation of extracellular da in the mpfc (gobert et al.
2000; li et al. 2005). in the rat, prefrontal 5-ht2a receptors
are located on pyramidal neurons and, to a lower degree, on
gabaergic interneurons (cornea-hebert et al. 1999; jakab
and goldman-rakic 2000). local activation of 5-ht2a
receptors in the mpfc influences da neuron activity in the
ventral tegmental area (vta) and da release in the
mesocortical pathway (bortolozzi et al. 2005). the 5ht2a antagonist, m100907, has been reported to increase
(schmidt and fadayel 1995) or exert no effect on da levels
in the mpfc (liegeois et al. 2002). it has been suggested
that the increase in da levels in the mpfc, relative to those
in the nucleus accumbens, following the administration of
second-generation antipsychotics, which produce relatively
weaker  xxxg656xxx  blockade and more potent 5-ht2a
receptor blockade, largely depend on combined d2/5-ht2a
receptor blockade (kuroki et al. 1999; li et al. 2005;
liegeois et al. 2002). at higher doses, which produce
greater  xxxg656xxx  occupancy, other mechanisms may be
involved, e.g.,  xxxg831xxx -adrenoceptor (devoto et al. 2004) or
 xxxg1115xxx  antagonism (gobert et al. 2000; pozzi et
al. 2002). it has been suggested that the combination of d2
and  xxxg1113xxx  blockade increases da release via the
 xxxg1108xxx  since some (ichikawa et al. 2001) but not
all (assie et al. 2005) studies have shown that the 5-ht1a
antagonist, way100635, antagonizes da release induced
by the d2 and  xxxg1113xxx  combination. in the present
study, m100907 alone induced a minor but significant

45

increase in extracellular da levels, but in combination with
haloperidol, m100907 robustly enhanced the da levels in
the mpfc, indicating that the d2/5-ht2a antagonism of
 xxxd3195xxx  and risperidone may critically control the da
release in the mpfc. however, at present, the mechanism
of action of the combined d2 and 5-ht2a antagonism on
extracellular levels of da in the mpfc is unclear.
as previously mentioned,  xxxd3195xxx  and risperidone
have  xxxg1115xxx  antagonistic properties (arnt and
skarsfeldt 1998). a recent study on  xxxg1115xxx 
immunoreactivity revealed that 5-ht2c receptors are
located on gabaergic interneurons in the vta and on
da neurons in the middle vta (bubar and cunningham
2007). systemic administration of the selective 5-ht2c
receptor agonist, way-163909, decreased the number of
spontaneously active da neurons in the vta (marquis et
al. 2007). administration of the selective  xxxg1115xxx 
agonist, ro-60-0175, locally into the vta antagonized
stress-induced increases in da levels in the mpfc without
affecting basal da levels (pozzi et al. 2002). thus, 5-ht2c
receptors may regulate da efflux in the mesocortical
system by activating tonic gaba inhibition or influencing
5-ht2c receptors on da neurons in the vta. in the present
study, a lower dose of sb242084 (0.5 mg/kg s.c.) tended to
increase the da levels in the mpfc, but the increase did
not reach statistical significance (p = 0.052). however, in
combination with haloperidol, sb242084 enhanced the da
levels distinctly in the mpfc compared to the vehicletreated animals, suggesting that the d2/5-ht2c antagonism
of  xxxd3195xxx  and risperidone may also contribute to the da
release in the mpfc.
in the present study, the administration of the potent  xxxg1112xxx  antagonist, gsk-742457 (upton et al. 2008), induced
a slight but significant increase in the mpfc da levels
when injected alone. when combined with haloperidol, the
increase in da levels was distinct compared to vehicletreated animals. the dose of gsk-742457 in the present
study has been shown to yield approximately 90%
occupancy at the  xxxg1119xxx  receptor in vivo (unpublished inhouse data), consistent with data reported by upton et al.
(2008). in a recent study, the  xxxg1119xxx  antagonist, sb271046  xxxd1891xxx  mg/kg p.o., produced augmented levels of
da and noradrenaline without altering the serotonin levels
in the mpfc (lacroix et al. 2004). another study using
the  xxxg1119xxx  receptor antagonist, sb-399885, reported that
this antagonist did not affect basal levels of da in the rat
mpfc significantly and had no effect on haloperidol
(0.1 mg/kg s.c.)-induced da efflux but potentiated
risperidone (1.0 m/kg s.c.)-induced da efflux (li et al.
2007). this indicates that  xxxg1119xxx  antagonism may affect
cortical da levels positively when administered alone or
in combination with current antipsychotics. however,
since  xxxd3195xxx  and risperidone have similar effects on

46

the da levels, the  xxxg1119xxx  antagonistic effect of  xxxd3195xxx 
may not be of significant importance for the effect on the
da levels.
 xxxd3195xxx  may enhance da levels in the mpfc by
affecting the above-mentioned receptor types. restoration of
prefrontal da levels would be expected to increase transmission through the  xxxg655xxx , which may alleviate cognitive
impairments and negative symptoms (abi-dargham and
moore 2003).
in the present study,  xxxd3195xxx , like risperidone, was found
to increase the extracellular levels of ach in the mpfc. as
previously described, second-generation antipsychotics markedly increased the levels of ach in the rat hippocampus,
leaving conventional antipsychotics with a very modest
increase (shirazi-southall et al. 2002). moreover, olanzapine,
but not haloperidol, increased ach release in the rat mpfc
(ichikawa et al. 2002b). in the latter study, none of the drugs
affected the level of ach in the nucleus accumbens or
striatum. so far, it has not been possible to clarify the
mechanism by which second-generation antipsychotics affect
ach levels. the combination of m100907 and haloperidol,
which enhances da release in the mpfc, did not affect the
ach release (ichikawa et al. 2002a). shirazi-southall et al.
(2002) reported that 5-ht2a, 5-ht2c, d2, or  xxxg1119xxx  receptor
antagonism alone increased ach levels approximately 50%
in the rat hippocampus without attaining statistical significance, while olanzapine and clozapine, both possessing high
affinities for muscarinic receptors, induced robust ach
increases. the selective  xxxg1119xxx  receptor antagonists, 4-(2bromo-6-pyrrolidin-1-ylpyridine-4-sulfonyl)phenyl xxxd2850xxx 
(riemer et al. 2003) and sb-399885 (hirst et al. 2006),
increased rat cortical ach levels significantly. however,
since  xxxd3195xxx  and risperidone have similar effects on the
ach levels, the  xxxg1119xxx  antagonistic effect of  xxxd3195xxx  may
not be of significant importance for the effect on the ach
levels. a recent study showed that local infusion of the d2
receptor agonist, quinelorane, into the nucleus accumbens
simultaneous with the infusion of nmda blocked the
nucleus accumbens nmda receptor-mediated increases in
ach in the rat mpfc (brooks et al. 2007), indicating a
complex regulation of the ach efflux in the mpfc. it is,
however, likely that the broad receptor profile of the secondgeneration antipsychotics is involved in the facilitating effect
on the ach neurotransmission in the mpfc.
it should be noted that, in the present work, the drug
effects on ach levels were measured in the presence of
neostigmine in the perfusion solution to detect potential
effects of the drugs reliably. however, increased basal
levels of ach due to ach esterase inhibition are assumed
to activate muscarinic autoreceptors (moor et al. 1998).
thus, this condition may complicate the interpretation of
results from experiments with drugs, which have additional
muscarinic receptor antagonism, e.g., clozapine produced

psychopharmacology (2009) 206:39–49

greater increases in the ach levels in mpfc in the presence
of neostigmine (ichikawa et al. 2002b). however, since
 xxxd3195xxx  and risperidone do not block muscarinic receptors (table 1), this is not considered an issue in the present
study.
in the present study,  xxxd3195xxx  and sb-271046 increased
the extracellular levels of glu in the mpfc. enhanced
extracellular levels of glu in the rat frontal cortex induced
by sb-271046 have been observed previously (dawson et
al. 2000, 2001). thus, the potent affinity of  xxxd3195xxx  for
the  xxxg1119xxx  receptor may be involved in the effect on the glu
levels. it is notable that the onset of increases in glu levels
induced by  xxxd3195xxx  and sb-271046 seems to be rather
slow. this might indicate that the effect of the compounds
on glu levels is mediated through indirect mechanisms.
however, plasma levels of sb-271046 peaks 3–4 h after
administration (routledge et al. 2000). this may also
explain the slow onset of increase in glu levels as regards
sb-271046.
it is well-established that acute pcp treatment increases
release of brain glu levels in the brain (enomoto et al.
2007; jentsch and roth 1999). adams and moghaddam
(2001) concluded that the acute pcp glu activation model
lacks predictive validity for current antipsychotics, since
haloperidol, clozapine, and m100907 were ineffective in
inhibiting the dopaminergic and motoric effects of acute
pcp (adams and moghaddam 2001). by comparing acute
and repeated pcp treatments, it has been concluded that
care should be taken when arguing for a complete
isomorphism between acute nmda antagonist-induced
behavioral deficits in animals and symptoms of schizophrenia (enomoto et al. 2007; jentsch and roth 1999). in
contrast, repeated pcp treatment has been suggested to be a
valid animal model of schizophrenia (for reviews, see
jentsch and roth 1999; enomoto et al. 2007). subchronic
treatment with pcp induced increased depolarization of
pyramidal neurons in the pfc after the application of
exogenous nmda (arvanov and wang 1999). this may
indicate an upregulation of nmda receptors due to
reduced glutamatergic transmission. in the same study, it
was demonstrated that clozapine administration prevented
the functional hypersensitivity. accordingly, acute administration of the nmda antagonist, mk-801, increased the
extracellular levels of glu in the mpfc (lopez-gil et al.
2007; zuo et al. 2006), while repeated administration of
mk-801 decreased glu levels in the mpfc (zuo et al.
2006). moreover, basal da levels seem to be reduced in the
rat pfc after subchronic pcp (jentsch and roth 1999).
since released glu facilitate cholinergic transmission in the
pfc (parikh et al. 2008), a normalization of glutamatergic
hypofunction may positively affect da and ach functions
in the pfc. the selective  xxxg1119xxx  antagonist, sb-399885,
was shown to fully reverse the deficit in spatial learning in

psychopharmacology (2009) 206:39–49

aged rats and scopolamine-induced deficit in the novel
recognition paradigm (hirst et al. 2006).
the increase in extracellular glu levels in the pfc, which
may be regulated by  xxxg1119xxx  receptor antagonism, differentiates  xxxd3195xxx  from risperidone. as previously described,
 xxxd3195xxx  induced a significant reversal of impairment in
extradimensional set shifting, while risperidone was ineffective (goetghebeur and dias 2009; rodefer et al. 2008).
basal level of glu of synaptic origin may be difficult to
measure due to the fact that glu apparently barely escapes the
synaptic cleft during basal conditions. astroglial cells have
been suggested to be an important source of basal glu levels
(schousboe and waagepetersen 2006) and more than 60% of
the basal extracellular level of glu has been suggested to be
of nonsynaptic origin (bogen et al. 2008; fonnum 1984).
microdialysis experiments using potassium depolarization
and extracellular calcium removal have indicated small
releasable pools of synaptic glu in the brain (frantz et al.
2002; herrera-marschitz et al. 1996). however, a variety of
studies have detected synaptic glu release by microdialysis
by means of chemical, electrical, and behavioral stimulation
(for review, see van der zeyden et al. 2008). despite the fact
that the source of the reported glu changes after acute and
chronic nmda antagonist and  xxxg1119xxx  antagonist treatments
is unclear at present, it is likely that the increased glu levels
facilitate the function of the nmda receptor.
one consideration for any drug that acts to modulate glu
would be the potential for excitotoxicity. however, various
strategies aimed at different neurotransmitter systems actually
alter the activity of glutamatergic neurons. for example, ach
esterase inhibitors increase the release of glu (dijk et al.
1995b), while 5-ht1a antagonism potentiates the effects of
both muscarinic agonists and nmda on glu release (dijk et
al. 1995a). thus, it is possible that cognitive benefits of
drugs directed at these targets involve actions on glutamatergic neurons. more direct approaches include ampakines,
which are positive modulators of the action of glu at ampa
receptors (arai and kessler 2007), and as previously
mentioned, strategies for increasing the nmda receptor
function (javitt 2007). in the context of reduced glu function
in schizophrenia and the fact that the above compounds have
actions, which modulate the efficacy of glu released in
normal synaptic transmission, an excitotoxicity potential
would appear to be less of a concern. in comparison,
cerebral ischemia has been reported to induce fivefold to
eightfold increase in extracellular glu levels in the rat brain
(benveniste 2009; dohmen et al. 2005).
in the present study, we demonstrate that the secondgeneration antipsychotic drug,  xxxd3195xxx , enhances extracellular levels of da, ach, and glu in the rat mpfc. thus,
restoration of insufficient dopaminergic and glutamatergic
transmission and strengthening of the cholinergic transmission in the pfc may be involved in the beneficial effects of

47

 xxxd3195xxx  on cognitive function and the superior effect
against negative symptoms compared to risperidone
reported in a clinical study on  xxxd3195xxx  and risperidone
(azorin et al. 2006).
