the late-gestation
surge in fetal plasma cortisol levels stimulates final stage
development of the lung and other organ systems (7, 22) and
indeed, in sheep, initiates birth (19, 32). parturition occurring
before this surge is associated with increased fetal mortality
and morbidity, most notably as a consequence of lung immaturity. whereas the sequence of events leading to cortisol
production per se are well understood, the precise mechanisms
involved in driving the rise in fetal plasma cortisol in late
gestation are yet to be fully explained.
it is apparent that important changes take place at each level
of the hypothalamic-pituitary adrenal axis, leading to the
prepartum increase in fetal plasma cortisol. an intact hypothalamic pituitary connection is essential, as clearly demonstrated
by hypothalamic pituitary disconnection (hpd) studies in fetal

sheep, in which the major consequences of this disruption are
the absence of the cortisol surge (11, 34, 38, 48, 53) and
delayed parturition (1, 2, 4, 33). increased adrenal responsiveness also is a critical mediating factor (18, 21, 41, 51). two
important effectors to this end, the  xxxg1385xxx  ( xxxg1385xxx , specifically known as the  xxxg1385xxx ) and steroid acute regulatory protein (star),
exhibit ontogenic increases in expression that occur in parallel
to the cortisol surge (8, 17, 49). the  xxxg1385xxx  is a seventransmembrane-spanning g protein-coupled receptor located
in the zona fasciculata of adrenal gland, whereas star transports the steroid precursor cholesterol from the outer to the
inner mitochondrial membrane for further processing. fetal
plasma acth concentrations also increase significantly in late
gestation (7, 26, 29), suggesting that acth may be the driving
force behind the changes in  xxxg1385xxx  and star expression.
although the importance of acth in regulating  xxxg1385xxx 
expression is, to our knowledge, yet to be examined in fetal
sheep, controversy exists regarding its impact on acth expression. findings from numerous in vitro studies support the
notion that acth is a positive regulator of  xxxg1385xxx  mrna
expression (23, 24, 27, 30, 31, 35). conversely, the two in vivo
studies undertaken to date have not demonstrated a positive
influence of acth on receptor expression in the fetus (6, 44).
recently, our investigative group (48) reported that hpd at
around 120 days of gestational age (dga) prevented not only
the late-gestation cortisol surge but also the increase in fetal
plasma acth levels, adrenal  xxxg1385xxx  mrna and protein
expression, and, indeed, adrenal responsiveness. we also demonstrated that  xxxg1385xxx  mrna levels and adrenal responsiveness could be restored by acth treatment of adrenal cells in
vitro. in addition, our group (49) has found a strong positive
correlation between plasma bioactive acth concentrations
and fetal adrenal  xxxg1385xxx  mrna expression. these findings
strongly suggest that acth regulates expression of its own
receptor and that increases in receptor mrna are positively
related to increased cortisol secretion.
considering the striking lack of agreement between the in
vitro and in vivo data, we decided to conduct a series of
experiments in an attempt to clarify whether physiological
increases in acth can upregulate  xxxg1385xxx  mrna expression
and, if so, whether this is accompanied by increased adrenal
responsiveness to acth. in doing so, we infused fetal sheep
with acth and subsequently examined adrenal  xxxg1385xxx 
mrna expression. we used fetuses from two age cohorts
distinguished by the supposed level of adrenal responsiveness

late-gestation plasma cortisol surge in the sheep fetus is critical for
stimulating organ development and parturition. increased adrenal
responsiveness is one of the key reasons for the surge; however, the
underlying mechanisms are not fully understood. our recent studies
suggest that acth-mediated increased expression of  xxxg1385xxx 
( xxxg1385xxx ) and steroid acute regulatory protein (star) may play a
role in enhancing responsiveness. hence, we examined effects of
acth infusion in fetal sheep on mrna expression of these two
mediators of adrenal responsiveness and assessed the functional
consequences of this treatment in vitro. fetuses of ⬃118 and 138 days
of gestational age (dga) were infused with acth-(1–24) for 24 h.
controls received saline infusion. arterial blood was sampled
throughout the infusion. adrenals were isolated and analyzed for
 xxxg1385xxx  and star mrna, or cells were cultured for 48 h. cells were
stimulated with acth, and medium was collected for cortisol measurement. fetal plasma acth and cortisol concentrations increased
over the infusion period in both groups.  xxxg1385xxx  mrna levels were
significantly higher in acth-infused fetuses in both the 118 and 138
dga groups. star mrna increased significantly in both the 118 and
138 dga groups. adrenal cells from acth-infused fetuses were
significantly more responsive to acth stimulation in terms of cortisol secretion than those from saline-infused controls. these findings
demonstrate that increases in circulating acth levels promote increased expression of  xxxg1385xxx  and star mrna and are coupled to
heightened adrenal responsiveness.

(low: 118 dga; high: 138 dga) with the expectation that a
more pronounced response would be evident in the older age
group. considering the importance of star in facilitating
steroidogenesis, star mrna levels also were assessed. furthermore, we determined whether increases in mrna levels
had any functional significance by examining the responsiveness of adrenocortical cells isolated from the fetuses to acth.

animals and surgery. time-dated, mixed breed, pregnant sheep
were obtained ⬃4 –5 days before surgery from local suppliers and
housed in straw-lined pens with ad libitum access to food and water.
the sheep were divided into two groups, ages ⬃112 and 132 dga at
the time of surgery, respectively. surgery was performed under
general anesthesia, using aseptic techniques to insert fetal femoral
arterial and venous and amniotic catheters. bolus gentamicin (80 mg;
abbott laboratories, north chicago, il) and ampicillin (500 mg;
american pharmaceutical partners, schaumburg, il) in isotonic saline were administered to the ewe for 2 days after surgery. all
procedures were approved by the wake forest university animal
care and use committee.
acth infusion. approximately 5 days after surgery, fetuses were
intravenously infused with acth-(1–24) ( xxxd1755xxx ; organon, west
orange, nj; n ⫽ 8 and 7 for the 118 and 138 dga groups, respectively) in saline at a dose intended to deliver ⬃0.5 ␮g 䡠 kg⫺1 䡠 h⫺1 over
24h. this dose was calculated with regard to expected fetal weight for
the particular gestational age. control fetuses were infused with saline
only (n ⫽ 6 and 7 for the 118 and 138 dga groups, respectively). in
the case of twin pregnancies (the majority, n ⫽ 14 of 20), one fetus
received acth whereas the other served as a control. all singleton
data and twin data were pooled. fetal blood samples (3 ml) were taken
at 0, 6, and 24 h for measurement of plasma acth and cortisol, gases
(o2 and co2, ph, and hematocrit). blood gases and ph were determined using an abl5 blood gas analyzer (radiometer, copenhagen,
denmark). fetal blood pressure, heart rate, and amniotic fluid pressure
were recorded to monitor fetal health (digi-med; micro-med enterprises, tustin, ca) during the first 6 h and the final hour of the
infusion period.
after the infusion was complete, both ewe and fetus(es) were killed
by pentobarbital sodium overdose (85 mg/kg iv), and fetal adrenals
were removed and immediately processed for cell culture or snap
frozen for later  xxxg1385xxx  and star mrna analysis. fetuses and data
are hereafter referred to as belonging to either the 118 or 138 dga
group in light of average postmortem age.
cell dispersion and culture. adrenals were cleaned, weighed, and
bisected, and the medulla was gently peeled out with a small layer of
cortex to ensure separation. cortical cells were dispersed in 0.4%
collagenase type i (worthington biochemical, lakewood, nj) for 2–3
h, washed, centrifuged through 60% percoll (sigma, st louis, mo),
counted, diluted in dmem-ham’s f-12-10% fetal calf serum, and
plated on 48-well plates at a density of 2 ⫻ 105 cells per well. after
48 h at 37°c in a 5% co2 atmosphere, the cells were rinsed two times
with serum-free dmem-ham’s f-12 medium containing 0.1%
polypep (sigma). this medium was used for all subsequent treat-

ments. after 1 h, the medium was removed and replaced with fresh
medium (unstimulated/control) or medium containing acth1–24
(0.15 nm  xxxd1755xxx ; organon) for 2 h, after which the medium was
removed and frozen for later cortisol determination.
tissue rna extraction and rnase protection assay. adrenocortical
tissue was isolated as already described, and total rna was extracted using trizol reagent (gibco-brl, carlsbad, ca) according
to the manufacturer’s recommendations. rna was quantified by
measuring absorbance at 260 nm and was then stored in aliquots at
⫺80°c until use.
rnase protection assay (rpa) was performed using an rpaii kit
(ambion, austin, tx). known quantities (0.5–20 ␮g) of rna (for a
standard curve) or aliquots of rna from samples were hybridized
with 32p-labeled probes for the  xxxg1385xxx  (1 ⫻ 105 cpm), star (1 ⫻
104 cpm), and 28s rrna (an internal control). after hybridization and
incubation with rnase solution, the protected fragments from each
reaction were precipitated and subsequently run on a 5% polyacrylamide gel containing 8 m urea. gels were then exposed to x-ray film
overnight, and the amount of signal was detected using a scanning
laser densitometer. a standard curve was constructed by plotting
standard rna concentration versus optical density of the signal from
the protected fragment. unknowns were quantitated using the
standard curve and regression analysis. the data are expressed as
the ratio of the optical density of  xxxg1385xxx  or star mrna to that
of 28s r rna.
acth and cortisol measurement. plasma-immunoreactive acth
and plasma and cell media cortisol concentrations were measured
using commercial ria kits (dsl, webster, tx). these assays have
been validated for measuring fetal sheep cortisol and acth. minimum detection limits were 0.6 ng/ml for cortisol and 3.5 pg/ml for
acth. coefficients of variation were 4.2% intra-assay and 7.0%
interassay for cortisol and 6.0% intra-assay and 7.0% interassay for
acth.
statistical analysis. the following data sets were compared using
two-way anova and the newman-keuls multiple comparison procedure:  xxxg1385xxx  and star mrna, in vitro cortisol secretion, and
adrenal (combined left and right)-to-body weight ratio. all fetal
plasma acth and cortisol concentrations, heart rate, blood pressure,
blood gas, and ph measurements over the infusion period were
compared using repeated-measures anova and the newman-keuls
multiple comparison procedure. postmortem-calculated acth infusion dose and within-age group fetal body and adrenal weights were
compared using student’s t-test. data are presented as means ⫾ se,
and differences were considered significant when p ⬍ 0.05.

acth infusion and  xxxg1385xxx  and star mrna in fetal sheep

discussion

our novel findings in this study indicate that acth can
upregulate mrna expression of its receptor and star in the
fetal sheep adrenal in vivo. furthermore, we have demonstrated that this can occur in fetuses of different gestational age
(118 and 138 days) and is accompanied by increased adrenal
responsiveness.
in adrenals isolated from 118 and 138 dga fetuses, we
found that expression of both  xxxg1385xxx  and star mrna was
markedly increased after 24-h infusion of acth. although

values represent means ⫾ se. basal (0 h) plasma cortisol concentrations were
significantly higher in 138 dga fetuses (p ⬍ 0.05). plasma acth concentrations in both acth-infused groups were significantly elevated by 6 h.
these levels were maintained at 24 h. plasma cortisol concentrations in both
acth-infused groups increased significantly with time (p ⬍ 0.05).

others have examined the influence of acth infusion on
 xxxg1385xxx  mrna levels, this is the first study to report the
effects of increased plasma acth concentrations on star
mrna expression in the fetal sheep adrenal. in accordance
with this regulatory influence of acth on star expression,
there have been studies conducted using other adult animal
models (i.e., rats and hamsters) demonstrating that acute
acth treatment increases expression of star mrna (3, 16,
25). the induction of star gene expression by acth is
predominately mediated by camp generated after acth ligand-receptor binding, which in turn facilitates the phosphorylation of various transcription factors (45).
with respect to  xxxg1385xxx  mrna expression, we are aware
of only one other study comparable to our own in which
measurements were made after 24 h of acth infusion (6). in

infusion in 118 dga fetuses (table 1). there were no significant differences in adrenal-to-body weight ratio (table 1).
fetal health, heart rate, and blood pressure. within both the
118 and 138 dga groups, there were no differences in blood
gases, ph, or hematocrit over the experimental period following the acth infusion. values fell within the following
ranges: ph, 7.32–7.35 (118 dga) or 7.33–7.35 (138 dga);
hematocrit: 26.5–31.6 (118 dga) or 31.6 –36.7 (138 dga);

and pco2, 43.7–51.5 (118 dga) or 45.9 –50.4 mmhg (138
dga). similarly, neither heart rate (data not shown) nor blood
pressure (baseline values were 45.2 ⫾ 6.4 and 54.3 ⫾ 6.4
mmhg in 118 and 138 dga fetuses, respectively) in any of the
treatment groups changed significantly over the infusion period.
plasma acth and cortisol concentrations. for plasma
acth concentrations there were effects of time (f ⫽ 7.39,
p ⬍ 0.01) and treatment (f ⫽ 11.16, p ⬍ 0.01), whereas for
cortisol concentrations there were effects of time (f ⫽ 31.92,

(f ⫽ 31.10, p ⬍ 0.0001).
there were no differences in basal plasma acth concentrations between groups, whereas basal plasma cortisol concentrations were significantly higher in 138 dga fetuses (fig.
1). in both 118 and 138 dga acth-infused fetuses, plasma
acth concentrations were significantly elevated from basal
levels at 6 h but were not any higher at 24 h. in contrast, plasma
cortisol levels were further elevated at 24 h (fig. 1). neither
acth nor cortisol concentrations changed significantly in
response to saline infusion in either age group.
adrenal  xxxg1385xxx  and star mrna. for adrenal  xxxg1385xxx 
mrna expression there were effects of both treatment (f ⫽
22.9, p ⬍ 0.001) and age (f ⫽ 48.0, p ⬍ 0.001). the same was
true for adrenal star mrna expression (treatment: f ⫽ 11.3,
p ⬍ 0.01; fetal age: f ⫽ 37.2, p ⬍ 0.001).
expression levels of both  xxxg1385xxx  and star mrna were
significantly increased after acth infusion in both the 118
and 138 dga groups (fig. 2).  xxxg1385xxx  and star mrna
levels were significantly higher in 138 compared with 118 dga
adrenals from saline-infused fetuses. representative gels for
 xxxg1385xxx  and star mrna are presented in fig. 3.
cell cortisol secretion data. in all unstimulated/control
groups, cortisol was below the limit of assay detection. there
were overall effects of both treatment (f ⫽ 10.8, p ⬍ 0.01) and
age (f ⫽ 34.6, p ⬍ 0.001) with regard to acth-induced
cortisol secretion from adrenocortical cells. the pattern of
cortisol secretion following acth stimulation was consistent
between the two age cohorts, with higher secretory responses
evident in cells isolated from acth-infused fetuses (fig. 4).

that study, infusion of acth-(1–24) at a dose of 0.5 ␮g/h to
126 –127 dga fetuses was found to have no effect on expression of  xxxg1385xxx  mrna. as in our study,  xxxg1385xxx  mrna
was quantified using rpa, leaving only the dose, timing, and
other differences in procedure to explain the disparity. one
such technical difference that may have had an impact was our
choice to restrict the analysis to adrenocortical tissue rather

than utilizing the whole adrenal. this may have enhanced our
ability to detect a treatment effect. another investigation undertaken by simmonds et al. (44), in which fetuses were
infused for a maximum of 18 days (from 115 dga) at 14.7
pmol䡠kg⫺1 䡠h⫺1, also failed to demonstrate an increase in
expression of  xxxg1385xxx  mrna. the relatively low sensitivity
of the slot blot technique used for quantifying  xxxg1385xxx  mrna
in this study may have precluded the detection of a treatment
effect. others (14, 17, 37, 50), including our group (49), have
reported the presence of multiple bands with the use of northern blot analysis for  xxxg1385xxx  mrna, with a major band at
⬃3.6 kb, whereas simmonds et al. were only able to detect one
band at 4.0 kb. their inability to detect all the bands usually
found to hybridize with the probe also may be a factor
underlying the difference between reports.
a report by fraser et al. (17) is consistent with our findings.
they examined plasma acth and  xxxg1385xxx  mrna changes
following hypoxemia in sheep fetuses. after 48 h of hypoxia,
plasma acth concentrations had increased from 20 to ⬎350
pg/ml in 132–134 dga fetuses. corresponding  xxxg1385xxx 
mrna expression was increased by ⬃40% over normoxic
controls. in addition, our group found a strong positive relationship between plasma acth-(1–39) concentrations and
adrenocortical  xxxg1385xxx  mrna levels in fetal sheep (49),

acth infusion and  xxxg1385xxx  and star mrna in fetal sheep

ajp-endocrinol metab • vol

adrenal maturation (15) did not appear to affect our results,
because we observed similar responses to acth infusion at
two different gestational ages.
aside from  xxxg1385xxx  and star mrna, other factors in the
acth signal cascade are likely to have been altered by acth
infusion in the present study. for instance, tangalakis et al.
(47) reported that mrna expression of both 17␣-hydroxylase
and cholesterol side-chain cleavage enzyme were significantly
elevated after infusion of acth, whereas in the studies of
carter et al. (6) and simmonds et al. (44), changes in steroidogenic enzymes were evident after infusion. in addition, the g
protein coupled to the  xxxg1385xxx , adenylate cyclase, and camp
also have been shown to be positively regulated by acth (12,
13, 28).
although not statistically significant, there was a definite
trend for acth-infused fetuses to have larger adrenals relative
to body weight. this was particularly evident in the 138 dga
group. other studies have noted direct or indirect effects of
acth on adrenal weight. for instance, carter et al. (5) found
that adrenocortical weight was increased in 105–112 dga
fetuses after 24 h of acth infusion. warnes et al. (50)
demonstrated that fetal sheep infused with  xxxd2633xxx  (a
competitive inhibitor of 11␤-hydroxylase) for 15 days had
plasma acth concentrations at 140 dga that were almost
double those in control (157 vs. 81 pg/ml) and that corresponding adrenal weights also were approximately double (830 vs.
430 mg). the importance of acth in promoting adrenal
growth is further emphasized in the fetal sheep hpd model, in
which our group has demonstrated that lower prevailing bioactive plasma acth concentrations are associated with decreased adrenal weights close to term. a number of other
studies also have found hpd fetuses to have lower adrenal
weights (9, 36, 42). the answer as to whether this increased
fetal adrenal weight following acth infusion is a consequence of hypertrophy or hyperplasia is unknown (in our
study, we did not have sufficient tissue to perform histology);
however, early work in adult rats suggests that acth exerts a
hypertrophic effect (10).
the late-gestation surge in plasma glucocorticoid levels is a
critical event with respect to preparation for birth in all mammals in which it has been examined. the precise mechanisms
underlying this phenomenon are currently the subject of investigation, with a number of mediating factors likely to be
involved. in this study we examined the importance of plasma
acth in regulating two key mediators of adrenal responsiveness,  xxxg1385xxx  and star mrna, and we report for the first
time that acth upregulates expression of both in fetal sheep
of different gestational ages. significantly, we found that these
in vivo changes had functional consequences in vitro, with
adrenal cells isolated from acth-infused fetuses exhibiting
heightened responsiveness. our findings are supportive of the
hypothesis that acth acts in vivo at the adrenal to upregulate
expression of the  xxxg1385xxx  and star. in the late-gestation
fetus, these changes are likely to be important contributory
mediators of increased fetal adrenal responsiveness and, hence,
the cortisol surge.

which is consistent with the in vivo effect in this study of
acth on expression of its receptor.
our findings with regard to acth-induced  xxxg1385xxx  and
star mrna upregulation are supported by a number of in
vitro studies. for example, lebrethon et al. (24) noted that
 xxxg1385xxx  mrna in cultured human fetal and adult adrenal
cells was significantly increased after incubation with acth.
penhoat et al. (35) reported similar findings using adult bovine
adrenal fasciculata-reticularis cells, as did mountjoy et al. (30)
with mouse and human adrenocortical carcinoma cell lines.
heightened expression of star mrna following acth exposure also has been demonstrated in cultured adult bovine and
human adrenocortical cells (23, 27, 31).
the fact that we were able to demonstrate upregulated
expression of  xxxg1385xxx  and star mrna in fetuses from two
distinct age cohorts is particularly important and provides
strong evidence for acth being a primary mediator of the
change in adrenal responsiveness. it also suggests that either 1)
the effects of acth are not limited to a critical window of
development, or 2) the critical window is large. that these
changes also have functional consequences is also a crucial
finding, as evident in our in vitro studies showing a positive
effect of acth on adrenal responsiveness.
although we did not have sufficient tissue to measure either
 xxxg1385xxx  or star protein expression in this investigation, both
the mrna and steroid secretion findings strongly suggest that
they would have been accordingly upregulated. in support of
this assertion, our group recently published work demonstrating in late-gestation fetuses that changes in  xxxg1385xxx  mrna
expression were accompanied by similar directional and proportional changes in protein expression (48). furthermore, in
earlier work (49), our group found that there was an excellent
correlation between  xxxg1385xxx  mrna expression and  xxxg1385xxx 
binding capacity, which in turn suggests a correlation between
receptor mrna and protein levels. with regard to star,
coulter et al. (8) reported that both star mrna and protein
expression increased in an ontogenic manner in late-gestation
sheep fetuses and that parallel postpartum decreases were
evident. we also have found that changes in star mrna
reflect changes in protein expression in adrenals from hpd
fetuses (46).
as previously mentioned, the acth-(1–24) infusion dose
used in our studies was designed to increase plasma acth
concentrations to those seen in the near-term fetus. there have
been numerous studies published in which plasma-immunoreactive acth concentrations in near-term control fetuses were
in excess of 200 pg/ml (20, 38 – 40, 52, 54). hence, we feel that
the mean peak concentrations attained in the present study
(over 200 pg/ml) are certainly within the physiological range.
it should be noted that in all of the studies cited (as in ours),
measurements were made using ria.
there were no within-age group differences in basal plasma
acth or cortisol concentrations in the present study. this is
consistent with findings from a previous study in which
schwartz and rose (43) showed that fetal plasma cortisol
levels in twins are similar until 2 days before the onset of labor
at term. these data suggest that is it feasible to utilize twins
fetuses in experimental designs in which one fetus receives
treatment and the other serves as a control until just before
parturition, when differences in plasma cortisol may be apparent. the possibility that twins may show a slight delay in

acth infusion and  xxxg1385xxx  and star mrna in fetal sheep
