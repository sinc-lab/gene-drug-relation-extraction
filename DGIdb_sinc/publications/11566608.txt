abstract
there is an increasing body of evidence demonstrating that growth factor networks are highly
interactive with  xxxg730xxx  (er) signalling in the control of breast cancer growth. as such,
tumour responses to anti-hormones are likely to be a composite of the er and growth factor inhibitory
activity of these agents. the current article examines the modulation of growth factor networks during
endocrine response, and presents in vitro and clinical evidence that  xxxg682xxx 
signalling, maintained in either an er-dependent or -independent manner, is critical to antihormonal-resistant breast cancer cell growth. the considerable potential of the epidermal growth
factor receptor-selective  xxxg2198xxx  inhibitor,  xxxd2186xxx  (iressa; astrazeneca) to efﬁciently treat,
and perhaps even prevent, endocrine-resistant breast cancer is highlighted.

introduction
until relatively recently endocrine response pathways in
breast cancer were described solely in terms of the
intracellular pathways used by oestrogens and the subsequent
disruptive effects exerted by anti-hormonal treatments on
 xxxg730xxx  (er) signalling (seery et al. 1999). thus,
it was frequently proposed that oestrogens promoted tumour
growth by binding to ers, which then acted as nuclear
transcription factors regulating the expression of genes
involved in proliferation and survival mechanisms. in
contrast, anti-hormones, acting either to reduce the amount
of oestrogens available to the tumour cells or by binding the
er to antagonise the cellular actions of oestrogens, prevented
this ﬂow of information to promote tumour remission
(nicholson et al. 1993a, seery et al. 1999).
however, a more modern view of endocrine response
pathways retains the concept that oestrogens acting through
ers are central to the development of breast cancer, but also
recognises that it is naive to consider er signalling in
isolation from the remainder of the cancer cell biology
(nicholson & gee 2000). indeed, an increasing number of
elements within the breast cancer phenotype, notably
including peptide growth factors, have now been identiﬁed
which modify and can be modiﬁed by er signalling

(nicholson & gee 2000). as such, they have the capacity to
signiﬁcantly inﬂuence the sensitivity of breast cancer cells to
oestrogens. importantly, however, these factors are also
likely to be critical in the mechanism of response to
anti-hormonal drugs, and moreover may be integral in the
escape from anti-hormone control of growth that occurs on
disease relapse.
within this context, the current article outlines a number
of concepts regarding the interplay between er and growth
factor signalling in hormone-sensitive breast cancer. in
particular, it is now known that while anti-hormones suppress
both er and insulin-like growth factor (igf) signalling
during response (freiss et al. 1990, guvakova & surmacz
1997, surmacz 2000), paradoxically they promote the
expression of  xxxg682xxx  (egfr) and
c-erbb2, receptors employed by egf-like ligands (dati et al.
1990, chrysogelos et al. 1994, yarden et al. 1996, defazio
et al. 1997). our recent experimental data demonstrate that
increased expression of egfr and c-erbb2 can occur in vitro
following challenge with several anti-hormonal drugs (he
jones, jmw gee, me harper, ae wakeling & ri nicholson,
unpublished observations; jm knowlden, i hutcheson, jmw
gee & ri nicholson, unpublished observations; mcclelland
et al. 2001). importantly, while such increases are redundant
in the anti-hormonal response, we have shown that the

nicholson et al.: egf receptor in er-positive breast cancer
egfr/c-erbb2 signalling network is ultimately harnessed by
the cells, enabling re-establishment of their growth in an
er-dependent or -independent manner. these events thus
appear to be critical in the generation of several forms of
acquired endocrine resistance and insensitivity. excitingly,
the phenotypic characteristics of breast tumours from patients
with hormone-resistant disease in many ways parallel these
experimental data (nicholson et al. 1993a, 1994a,b, 1997a,b,
gee et al. 2001a). furthermore, our in vitro data also show
that such endocrine-resistant or -insensitive cells are highly
sensitive to the egfr-selective  xxxg2198xxx  inhibitor, zd
1839 (iressa; astra zeneca). the compound obliterates
egfr
signalling
and
effectively
blocks
anti-hormonal-resistant tumour cell growth in the presence
or absence of exogenous ligands for the egfr. since the
anti-tumour effects are long lasting and synergistic with
anti-hormones, the data highlight the considerable potential
of such inhibition as a means of efﬁciently treating
endocrine-resistant and -insensitive breast cancer.

er signalling and growth factors in
hormone-sensitive breast cancer
the concept that peptide growth factors can act as mediating
factors in the growth of hormone-sensitive breast cancer is
not a new one. it has its origins in the late 1980s, when it
was ﬁrst recognised that oestrogens were able to stimulate
expression of a number of growth factor regulatory elements
(e.g. transforming growth factor-alpha (tgf-alpha) and  xxxg1146xxx )
in hormone-sensitive human breast cancer cell lines (bates
et al. 1988, lee et al. 1994). such actions signiﬁcantly
supplemented the cellular mitogenic responses and gene
expression directly primed by oestrogens (cho &
katzenellenbogen 1993, smith 1998). importantly, this
concept, although not repudiated in more recent years, has
now been substantially modiﬁed to incorporate a further
fascinating dimension. the intracellular signalling pathways
associated with oestrogen and growth factor action are
known to be more highly networked and interactive than was
originally thought. indeed, it is unlikely that mitogenic
signalling arising from either of the pathways can operate
efﬁciently in the absence of the other (nicholson & gee
2000). moreover, this is perceived to be not just a function
of their ability to coregulate the expression of genes involved
in proliferation and cell survival (musgrove et al. 1993,
lukas et al. 1996, huang et al. 1997, wang et al. 1998), but
is, in part, due to a physical overlapping and common use of
their signalling elements (nicholson & gee 2000). for
example, numerous studies have now shown that key
receptors in such pathways (for example er and  xxxg1144xxx 
receptor ( xxxg1145xxx )) are subject to activation by both
oestrogens and peptide growth factors (aronica &
katzenellenbogen 1993, bunone et al. 1996, richards et al.
1996). the important pharmacological signiﬁcance of such

176

convergence in hormone-sensitive breast cancer cells is that
anti-hormonal drugs not only possess anti-oestrogenic
activity through their ability to block er signalling, but also
have anti-growth factor actions by virtue of their ability to
disrupt the intimate cross-talk between oestrogen and growth
factor signalling (freiss et al. 1990, guvakova & surmacz
1997). indeed, the increasing body of experimental data,
supplemented by recent clinical studies examining the
phenotypic proﬁle during the tamoxifen-responsive phase of
the disease, indicates it is most likely a combination of these
anti-oestrogenic and anti-growth factor actions that is
responsible for tumour remissions following anti-hormonal
challenge of breast cancer patients (gee et al. 2001b).
at this juncture, it is noteworthy that the experimental
and clinical data imply that not all growth factors are used
equally to drive the growth of oestrogen-sensitive breast
cancer cells, a phenomenon governed, at least in part, by the
cellular availability of growth factor receptors. thus,
oestrogens appear to ‘favour’ synergistic growth interactions
with igfs (dupont et al. 2000), with oestrogens inducing the
expression of the  xxxg1145xxx . not surprisingly, therefore, many
er-positive breast cancer cells in vitro and in vivo coexpress
considerable levels of  xxxg1145xxx , with a strong correlation
apparent between  xxxg1145xxx  and er levels in the clinic (railo
et al. 1994, happerﬁeld et al. 1997, surmacz 2000).
in marked contrast, oestrogens appear to ‘disfavour’
growth interactions with egf and tgf-alpha. expression of the
egfr protein (and mrna), as well as its favoured
heterodimerisation partner c-erbb2 (martinez-lacaci et al.
1999), is suppressed by long-term therapy with oestrogens in
vitro (dati et al. 1990, chrysogelos et al. 1994, yarden et
al. 1996, defazio et al. 1997). in contrast to igfs, egfr
ligands are poor inducers of the growth of hormone-sensitive
cells, where at best they promote growth responses which are
additive (but not synergistic) with  xxxd2037xxx . finally, there
are obvious inverse associations between these receptor
 xxxg2198xxx  receptors and er expression in clinical and
experimental samples (nicholson et al. 1993a, 1994a,
1997a,b, sharma et al. 1994a,b). in parallel, there is merely
low expression of the egfr ligand tgf-alpha (nicholson et al.
1994b), with activation of the important downstream
signalling target for egfr, mitogen-activated protein (map)
kinase, also minimal in er-positive disease both in the clinic
(gee et al. 2001a) and in vitro (mcclelland et al. 2001).
in total, these data convincingly demonstrate that
hormone-sensitive breast cancer cells possess potent
mechanisms to limit egfr/c-erbb2-mediated signalling
(yarden et al. 1996).
this concept has signiﬁcant clinical implications. several
studies have now demonstrated that while anti-hormones
disrupt favoured er–growth factor interactions to inhibit
breast cancer cell growth (e.g. via diminishing activation/
expression of  xxxg1145xxx  (freiss et al. 1990, guvakova &
surmacz 1997, surmacz 2000)), there is parallel

de-repression of disfavoured pathways. indeed, we and
others (warri et al. 1991) have observed time-dependent
increases in expression of egfr/c-erbb2 during
anti-hormonal challenge of mcf-7 human breast cancer cells
in vitro and within clinical material obtained during therapy.
the existence of such cellular mechanisms may offer breast
cancer cells the option of using these pathways to (i) initially
survive oestrogen deprivation (yarden et al. 1997) and
(ii) eventually re-instigate endocrine-resistant or -insensitive
tumour cell growth (mcclelland et al. 2001).

long-term effects of anti-hormones on
the growth of mcf-7 breast cancer cells
in order to further monitor the inductive effects of
anti-hormonal drugs on egfr and c-erbb2 signalling
pathways, interplay with er signalling, and tumour regrowth
during therapy (i.e. endocrine-resistant or -insensitive
growth), we have cultured mcf-7 breast cancer cells with
various anti-oestrogens in long-term monolayer culture
(mcclelland et al. 2001).

anti-oestrogens induce egfr and c-erbb2
signalling and instigate an egfr-primed
autocrine growth regulatory loop in
tamoxifen- and  xxxd2165xxx -resistant breast
cancer cells
mcf-7 cells are oestrogen-responsive for their growth and
are growth inhibited by many anti-oestrogenic drugs
(nicholson et al. 1995, 1996). however, their continuous
culture in the presence of tamoxifen or  xxxd2165xxx  eventually
generates sublines which tolerate the presence of the
anti-oestrogens, regrowing at rates equivalent to the original
hormone-responsive parental cells (mcclelland et al. 2001).
this closely mirrors the clinical scenario, where development
of resistance is almost inevitable for patients demonstrating
an initial endocrine therapeutic sensitivity (cheung et al.
1997).
in our own studies, such anti-hormonal-resistant mcf-7
sublines uniformly express increased amounts of egfr
mrna and protein (mcclelland et al. 2001). thus, for
example, while egfr immunostaining of the parental
mcf-7 cells demonstrates that they express only extremely
modest levels of egfr, both tamoxifen- and
 xxxd2165xxx -resistant cells contain up to 10-fold higher levels
of egfr membrane staining. we have also noted parallel
increases
in
c-erbb2
immunostaining
in
the
anti-oestrogen-resistant cells. complementary data have
previously been reported for the egfr by yarden et al.
(1997), who showed that in the absence of oestrogen egf
had a much stronger proliferative effect, indicating an
increased potential of such cells to use the egfr for growth.
indeed, treatment of the cells with  xxxd576xxx , a pure

www.endocrinology.org

anti-oestrogen that similarly increases egfr levels, also
increased egf growth responses, again indicating that
therapies depriving cells of their oestrogenic input increase
sensitivity to egfr ligands. our phenotypic data monitoring
egfr and c-erbb2 in the cell lines are further supported by
a battery of in vitro gene transfer studies and the expression
proﬁles observed in several additional acquired
tamoxifen-resistance models (vickers et al. 1988, clarke et
al. 1989, valverius et al. 1990, van agthoven et al. 1992,
1994, benz et al. 1993, miller et al. 1994, pietras et al. 1995,
van den berg et al. 1996, kurokawa et al. 2000).
consistent with the concept that overexpressed egfr
and c-erbb2 may play a role in the development of
anti-oestrogen resistance, we have been able to demonstrate
by immunoprecipitation studies that these receptors are
heterodimerised and fully active in such cells (jm
knowlden, i hutcheson, jmw gee & ri nicholson,
unpublished observations). since the tamoxifen-resistant
variants also express numerous egfr ligands, each of
which is able to further increase the levels of activated
egfr and c-erbb2 and induce additional growth responses,
it appears likely that the new growth signal originates from
an egfr-primed autocrine regulatory loop. signiﬁcantly,
yarden et al. (1997) demonstrated that increased egfr
acts as a survival factor, since blocking this receptor with
an egfr-neutralising antibody caused a 2-fold induction
of apoptosis.
further assessment of the importance of egfr/c-erbb2
signalling in the resistant cells was made following our
development of an immunohistochemical procedure for
localising the activated (i.e. phosphorylated) forms of erk
1/2 map kinases (actmapk) using a phosphorylation
state-speciﬁc antibody (gee et al. 2001a). these enzymes are
pivotal components of the intracellular phosphorylation
cascade from the plasma membrane to the nucleus recruited
for egfr/c-erbb2 signal transduction (english et al. 1999).
using this technique, actmapk was found to be
considerably higher in the anti-hormonal-resistant sublines
than in the parental mcf-7 cells (mcclelland et al. 2001)
and to be further inducible by various ligands for the egfr.
interestingly, complementary associations have previously
been reported in vitro between acquisition of steroid
hormone independence (coutts & murphy 1998) or
tamoxifen resistance (kurokawa et al. 2000) by er-positive
breast cancer cells and increased erk 1/2 mapk
phosphorylation. we conﬁrmed staining speciﬁcity in the
resistant cells following its reduction by  xxxd1169xxx , a  xxxg1361xxx 
inhibitor previously shown to inhibit the phosphorylation and
activation of erk 1/2 mapk (alessi et al. 1995). importantly,
 xxxd1169xxx  was also found to be a highly effective inhibitor
of the growth of the anti-hormonal-resistant cells, producing
an arrest of cell proliferation (mcclelland et al. 2001). these
data in total conﬁrm that this signalling pathway has been
harnessed by the resistant cells and is of critical importance

tamoxifen-resistant breast cancer cells
express and use er as part of the
egfr-regulated growth pathway
the tamoxifen-resistant variants, like their clinical
counterparts (robertson et al. 1992, nicholson & gee 1996,
robertson 1996, johnston et al. 1997), continue to express er
at a level equivalent to that observed in the parental cell line.
signiﬁcantly, the er can be demonstrated to be involved in
maintaining the new egfr-driven growth regulatory loop.
exposure of tamoxifen-resistant cells to the pure antioestrogen  xxxd2165xxx  at a dose which obliterates the er protein
by increasing the sensitivity of the receptor to proteolytic
attack and disrupting its nucleocytoplasmic shuttling (gibson
et al. 1991, dauvois et al. 1992, seery et al. 1999) interestingly
leads to a concomitant loss of activation of egfr and c-erbb2.
there is an equivalent reduction in activation of the egfr/
c-erbb2 downstream signalling components erk 1/2 mapk.
importantly, the parallel loss of er and egfr/c-erbb2
signalling following  xxxd2165xxx  treatment is associated with an
effective inhibition of the growth of the cells (jm knowlden, i
hutcheson, jmw gee & ri nicholson, unpublished
observations). since  xxxd2165xxx  does not decrease the total
cellular levels of the egfr, c-erbb2 or erk 1/2 mapk
proteins in such cells, it appears likely that this anti-oestrogen
inﬂuences the activity of the growth factor signalling pathway
by limiting the availability of one or more of its ligands.
interestingly, our preliminary studies indicate that a ligand
targeted by  xxxd2165xxx  in tamoxifen-resistant cells may be
tgf-alpha. such a concept is reinforced by ‘add-back’
experiments, where exogenous tgf-alpha or egf not only
activates egfr, c-erbb2 and erk 1/2 mapk but also supports
substantial tumour cell growth in the presence of  xxxd2165xxx .
strengthening the egfr pathway thus appears able to entirely
circumvent the catastrophic effects of this anti-oestrogen on
the er protein in such cells. egfr ligand-treated cells are thus
refractory to the growth inhibitory effects of both tamoxifen
and  xxxd2165xxx  (i.e. complete endocrine insensitivity), data
certainly implying that the primary growth regulatory role for
er in the tamoxifen-resistant cells is to maintain the efﬁciency
of egfr signalling.

 xxxd2165xxx -resistant cell growth is egfr
regulated independently of er
in marked contrast to the tamoxifen-resistant subline, we
have observed that cells actively growing in the presence of
 xxxd2165xxx  (i.e.  xxxd2165xxx -resistant) show only very low basal
expression of the er protein. indeed, using our standard
h222-erica assay, only 2% of such cells can be shown to
be weakly or very weakly stained for er, and also with lower

178

er mrna levels than the parental cell line (mcclelland et
al. 2001).  xxxd2165xxx -resistant cells also fail to express the
classically oestrogen-regulated gene  xxxg1737xxx 
and show no oestrogen-response element (ere) activity as
judged through transient transfection of an ere-bearing
reporter gene plasmid construct into the cells (mcclelland et
al. 2001). results in many aspects comparable with these
data have been published by larsen et al. (1997). these data
indicate that the enhanced egfr signalling observed in
 xxxd2165xxx -resistant cells provides their primary mitogenic
stimulus that is not supplemented by an er-mediated
input.

egfr/c-erbb2 signalling and endocrine
response in clinical breast cancer
almost two decades have now elapsed since the ﬁrst report
describing the presence of egfr in some human breast
tumours (sainsbury et al. 1985). of particular interest was
the observation that predominance of the protein was
associated with elevated proliferative capacity, disease
progression and extremely poor patient prognosis (nicholson
et al. 1993a, 1994a, 1997a,b). since that time, a universal
ﬁnding has been that expression of the egfr protein is
highly variable within the breast cancer population. for
example, 앑50% of operable cases showing egfr membrane
immunostaining and several studies have recorded that
egfr positivity is associated with an increased likelihood of
failure to respond to endocrine measures de novo (nicholson
et al. 1993a, 1994a, 1997a,b). a parallel relationship
between c-erbb2 overexpression, poorer prognosis and
anti-hormonal resistance has also been observed, although
these associations as yet remain controversial (nicholson et
al. 1993a, 1997a,b, elledge et al. 1998, houston et al. 1999).
similarly, we have observed that elevated tgf-alpha
expression is correlated with de novo endocrine failure in
er-positive disease, where there is also a prominent
association with proliferation (nicholson et al. 1994b). in
addition, we have observed a highly signiﬁcant association
between elevated actmapk, shortened survival, and poorer
quality and shortened duration of anti-hormonal response
(gee et al. 2001a). enhanced actmapk was observed in
앑80% of er-positive, tamoxifen-resistant tumours that also
demonstrated evidence of elevated tgf-alpha/egfr signalling
(gee et al. 2001a), with multivariate analysis demonstrating
actmapk to be a signiﬁcant independent predictor for
response duration and patient survival in such patients. in
total, these data certainly indicate the existence of an
egfr-driven autocrine growth regulatory loop capable of
maintaining tumour cell growth in the presence of
anti-hormonal drugs. indeed, although few data exist
monitoring egfr/c-erbb2/tgf-alpha/actmapk levels in breast
cancer specimens obtained during endocrine response and at

the time of relapse, our early clinical data employing highly
sensitive
immunocytochemical
procedures
have
demonstrated small but signiﬁcant increases in these
elements at the time of acquisition of tamoxifen resistance.
moreover, it is feasible that there is cross-talk of such
signalling with er in acquired resistant disease, since
second-line anti-hormonal responses (cheung et al. 1997)
and substantial er expression (robertson et al. 1992,
nicholson & gee 1996, robertson 1996, johnston et al.
1997) are commonly noted in such patients.

studies with the egfr-selective tyrosine
kinase inhibitor iressa
inhibition of tumour cell growth and egfr
signalling
the observation that our tamoxifen- and  xxxd2165xxx -resistant
cells express high levels of egfr, c-erbb2 and actmapk
(mcclelland et al. 2001) and a proﬁle of egfr ligands led
us to evaluate the anti-tumour effects of  xxxd2186xxx . this is a
small molecule egfr-selective  xxxg2198xxx  inhibitor,
which we previously demonstrated to be highly effective in
blocking growth of egfr-positive du145 and lncap
prostate carcinoma cells in vitro (jones et al. 1997, 2001).
the compound is a non-peptide anilinoquinazoline currently
demonstrating considerable promise in pre-clinical and
clinical studies examining cancer types enriched for egfr
positivity (baselga & averbuch 2000, ciardiello et al. 2000,
meric et al. 2000). it inhibits egfr  xxxg2198xxx  at
concentrations at least 100-fold lower than for many other
kinases tested, notably including c-erbb2 (wakeling et al.
1994, 1996). in line with its action as a competitive inhibitor
of atp binding to egfr,  xxxd2186xxx  has been shown to
prevent autophosphorylation of egfr in a number of
cultured tumour cell lines, resulting in an inhibition of the
activation of key downstream signalling molecules
(baselga & averbuch 2000).
signiﬁcantly, in our breast cancer models of tamoxifen
and  xxxd2165xxx  resistance, 1 µm  xxxd2186xxx  efﬁciently blocks
the egfr autophosphorylation and the activation of erk 1/2
mapk under both basal and egfr-primed conditions (jm
knowlden, i hutcheson, jmw gee & ri nicholson,
unpublished obsevations). in each instance, cell growth was
markedly inhibited, contrasting the relative lack of effect of
this drug on the growth of the parental endocrine-responsive
mcf-7 cells (mcclelland et al. 2001). importantly, the
growth inhibitory effects of  xxxd2186xxx  were long-lasting,
indicating that the autocrine egfr loop is critical to the
growth of these anti-hormonal-resistant cells and that no
other mitogenic network is readily available when egfr
signalling is blocked. the increase in cellular expression of
egfr generated by anti-hormones thus appears to provide a

www.endocrinology.org

promising molecular target for effective treatment of
endocrine-resistant and -insensitive phases of the disease.
since parallel analysis of egfr expression proﬁles in
resistant breast tumour specimens indicates this concept
could prove applicable to clinical disease (nicholson et al.
1993a, 1994a, 1997a,b), trial data with  xxxd2186xxx  in such
breast cancer patients are eagerly awaited.

combination of anti-oestrogen and anti-egfr
treatments efﬁciently blocks development of
resistance in parental anti-hormone-sensitive
breast cancer cells
as described above, in our breast cancer cell lines the
upregulation of egfr proved to be consistently critical in the
development of anti-hormone resistance. in anticipation of
their switch to this essential egfr pathway used in resistance,
we undertook experiments in which the parental
anti-hormone-responsive mcf-7 cells were treated with zd
1839 alone or in combination with tamoxifen or  xxxd2165xxx .
importantly, while  xxxd2186xxx  was largely without an additive
growth inhibitory effect with the anti-hormones during the ﬁrst
month of therapy, thereafter the agents showed synergistic
growth inhibitory activity, fully blocking the development of
anti-hormone resistance (jmw gee & ri nicholson,
unpublished observations). indeed, during this period not only
did  xxxd2186xxx  substantially suppress proliferative activity
within the dual-treated cells, but its presence led to a massive
loss of cell numbers due to marked increases in the rate of
apoptosis. this ﬁnding is highly supportive of the concept that
combination therapies that simultaneously target oestrogen
and growth factor signalling may be more effective than the
sequential use of such drugs. moreover, these exciting
experimental studies indicate that  xxxd2186xxx  may prevent
development of the endocrine-resistant state.

herceptin challenge reveals an important role
for c-erbb2 in directing the growth of
tamoxifen-resistant cells
although the data we have presented with  xxxd2186xxx  clearly
demonstrate a central role for egfr in the development of
anti-hormone resistance, it is equally evident that
phosphorylation of c-erbb2, the favoured heterodimerisation
partner of the egfr (martinez-lacaci et al. 1999), is also
relevant. we have thus examined the role of c-erbb2 in
anti-hormone-resistant cell growth using herceptin, a
c-erbb2-directed antibody therapy which inhibits the growth
of many c-erbb2-positive cancer cell lines (sliwkowski et
al. 1999) and promotes tumour remissions in breast cancers
overexpressing c-erbb2 by gene ampliﬁcation (baselga 2001,
slamon et al. 2001). we have noted that herceptin is highly
effective at inhibiting the growth of the tamoxifen-resistant
variants, in marked contrast with its lack of effect on the

179

nicholson et al.: egf receptor in er-positive breast cancer
parental hormone-responsive cell line. complementary data
have been obtained by kurokawa et al. (2000), who report
efﬁcacy of a small molecule inhibitor of this receptor in their
mcf-7 model of tamoxifen resistance derived by stable
transfection of c-erbb2 cdna. our data indicate that (i) the
role of c-erbb2 in growth regulation is extremely limited in
the parental anti-hormone-sensitive cells and (ii) autocrine
activation of egfr in the tamoxifen-resistant cells recruits
the c-erbb2 receptor protein as an essential partner directing
cell growth.

summary and conclusions
anti-oestrogen therapy is considered by many as the ﬁrst-line
therapeutic option for the management of er-positive breast
cancer. unfortunately, clinical application of such endocrine
measures has revealed that responses are remarkably variable
and often short-lived. an understanding of the complex
mechanisms contributory towards loss of anti-oestrogen
response is an important research goal since it should allow
a rational approach to be taken in the effective treatment,
delay or even prevention of the development of resistance,
thereby severely compromising the disease process and
improving patient survival.
signiﬁcantly, in our current studies we have
demonstrated that increases in egfr/c-erbb2/actmapk
signalling can promote tamoxifen and  xxxd2165xxx  resistance in
a human breast cancer cell line in vitro, and that resistant
growth can be inhibited in a sustained manner by blocking
of egfr signalling using  xxxd2186xxx . moreover, if  xxxd2186xxx 
is used to treat hormone-responsive cells in combination with
either of the anti-oestrogens, it increases tumour cell kill to
such a degree that resistance to these agents cannot occur.
clinical trials of  xxxd2186xxx  are now obviously required to
determine if such responses apply as fully to human breast
cancer exposed to anti-hormones in vivo as they apparently
do in vitro. finally, our model indicates that in order for
breast cancer cells to escape the cellular actions of
anti-hormones, they must possess compensatory survival
pathways that ultimately allow the development of drug
resistance. the strategic targeting of such survival factors
could potentially prove a highly complementary addition to
the existing pharmacological armoury appropriate to the
cancer patient. the identiﬁcation and exploitation of such
pathways in cancer cells treated with anti-hormones or
chemotherapeutic agents is now the primary research goal
within the tenovus centre for cancer research.
