department of neurology, stanford university medical center, stanford, ca 94305, usa

summary. the affinities of 11 drugs for both dopamine d2
and 5-hydroxytryptamine3 (5-ht3) receptor sites were determined in brain membranes. the five "traditional" antiemetics (chlorpromazine,  xxxd3018xxx ,  xxxd1945xxx ,
fluphenazine, and  xxxd1927xxx ) displayed high affinity
( < 20 nm) for dopamine d2 receptors in corpus striatum
but were inactive at 5-ht3 receptors. in contrast, five recently developed
5-ht3 antagonists
(brl 43694,
ics 205-930, zacopride, lilly 278584, and mdl 72222)
displayed nanomolar affinity for the 5-ht3 site but were
inactive ( > 10,000 nm) at the dopamine d 2 receptor. metoclopramide was unique among these agents in that it was
similarly potent at dopamine d2 (240+_60 nm) and 5-ht3
(120 +_30 nm) receptors.

introduction

nausea and vomiting resulting from cancer chemotherapy
are common side effects that can cause patients to refuse
subsequent chemotherapeutic sessions [19]. however,
against certain types of chemotherapy- or radiation-induced nausea and vomiting, traditional antiemetics such
as  xxxg656xxx  antagonists [27, 30, 33] are only
minimally effective. moreover, dopamine d2 antagonists
often cause side effects such as extrapyramidal symptoms,
which further restrict their usefulness [3, 17, 21].
a new class of pharmacological agents has recently
been developed that appears to possess uniquely potent
and effective antiemetic activity [24]. these drugs have
been designated 5-hydroxytryptamine3 (5-ht3) receptor
antagonists and include drugs such as ics 205-930 and
mdl 72222 [12, 28]. metoclopramide, traditionally considered to be a dopaminergic antagonist, has also been reported to have  xxxg1116xxx  antagonist properties
[13, 22]. in animals, 5-ht3 antagonists block both cytotoxic drug- and radiation-induced emesis [1, 6, 11, 22-24, 31].
these drugs also appear to abolish nausea and vomiting in
patients receiving cytotoxic drugs [4, 10, 20]. in the present
study, a series of five traditional dopamine d2 antagonists,
five recently developed 5-ht3 antagonists, and metoclopramide were analyzed at both dopamine d2 and  xxxg1116xxx  binding sites in brain membranes.

material and methods

radioligand-binding studies were carried out according to
the methods of ison and peroutka [18] and peroutka and
hamik [26]. frozen rat brains (pel freez biologicals; rogers, ark) were thawed from - 20 ° c and dissected. tissue
was homogenized in 20 vol. 50 m m t r i s (ph 7.7 at 25 ° c)
for [3h]-spiperone binding or krebs-hepes buffer for
[3h]-quipazine assays and centrifuged at 49,000g for
10 min. cortical tissue was used for [3h]-quipazine binding
and corpus striatum, for [3h]-spiperone binding. the supernatant was discarded and the pellet resuspended in the
same volume of buffer. after a 10-min incubation at 37 ° c,
the tissue was again centrifuged. the final pellet was resuspended in 80 vol. assay buffer. for dopamine binding
([3h]-spiperone +40 n m  xxxd2419xxx  [25]), the assay buffer
consisted of lo-sm  xxxd2850xxx , 4 m m cac12, and 0.1% ascorbate in 50 m m tris. [3h]-quipazine binding was carried out in a krebs-hepes buffer that consisted of 25 m m
hepes, 120 m m  xxxg2020xxx , 2.5 m m caci2, 4.8 m m kc1, and
1.2 m m mgci2 (ph adjusted to 7.4).
binding assays consisted of 0.1 ml [3h]-ligand, 0.1 ml
buffer or displacing drug, and 0.8 ml tissue homogenate.
following a 30-rain incubation at 25 ° c, the assays were
rapidly filtered under vacuum through ~¢32 glass-fiber filters (schleicher and schuell; keene, nh) with two 5-ml
washes using 50 m m  xxxd3449xxx . radioactivity was measured by liquid scintillation spectroscopy in 2.5 ml scintillation cocktail (research products international; mr.
prospect, ill) at 61% efficiency. all experiments were carried out in triplicate and repeated 3 - 6 times. specific
binding was defined as the excess over blanks taken in the
presence of 1 0 - 6 m (+)butaclamol for [3h]-spiperone
binding and 10 - 7 m ics 205-930 for [3h]-quipazine binding. generally, 75% of the [3h]-spiperone binding and 40%
of the [3h]-quipazine binding was specific.
drugs were prepared for experiments as follows: endon-(9-methyl-9-azabicyclo-[3,2,1 ]non-3-yl)- 1-methyl- 1h-indazole-3-carboxamide (brl43694), (3a-tropanyl)-lhindole-3-carboxylic acid ester (ics 205-930), zacopride,
1-methyl- n-(8-methyl-8-azabicyclo[3.2.1 ] xxxg1803xxx -yl)- 1hindazole-3-carboxamide (lilly 278584), and metoclopramide were dissolved in assay buffer; lah,3a,5ahtropan-3-yl-3,5-dichlorobenzoate (mdl 72222), chlorpromazine, and  xxxd2419xxx  were dissolved in dh20 and
then diluted in assay buffer; (+)butaclamol,  xxxd1945xxx ,
and fluphenazine were dissolved in 25%-50% etoh at

308
10 -3 m and then diluted in buffer; and  xxxd1927xxx  and
 xxxd3018xxx  were dissolved in 25% 1 m acetic acid
and diluted in assay buffer.

discussion

the major finding of the present study is that the 11 drugs
tested showed differential interactions with dopamine d2
and  xxxg1116xxx  sites. the 5-ht3 antagonists, although
showing nanomolar affinity for central 5-ht3 recognition
sites, were inactive at  xxxg656xxx  sites. conver-

309
sely, the traditional antiemetics showed high affinity for
the dopamine d2 site. with the exception of metoclopramide, these drugs were approximately 100-2,000 times
more potent at the d2 site than at the 5 - h t 3 site. metoclopramide appeared to be similarly potent at d2 and 5-ht3
sites, a unique finding among the 11 drugs tested.
the antiemetic efficacy of various drugs, including dopamine d2 antagonists, antihistamines, anticholinergics,
and corticosteroids has been well documented [14, 15, 30,
32-34]. unfortunately, these traditional antiemetics provide only modest relief from nausea and vomiting in patients undergoing therapy with most chemotherapeutic
drugs; they are of extremely limited value with agents such
as cisplatin, doxorubicin, and  xxxd1796xxx , which induce
severe nausea and vomiting. of particular interest is the
claim that high-dose metoclopramide is the most effective
agent currently available for the treatment of adverse effects caused by these regimens [33].
in
contrast,
5-ht3
antagonists
(mdl 72222,
ics 205-930,  xxxd3097xxx , and gr38032f) are a recently
developed group of drugs that have been shown to be potent antiemetics in ferrets receiving cisplatin and totalbody radiation [6, 7, 8, 22-24, 31]. in recent human trials,
the 5-ht 3 antagonists gr38032f [101, ics 205-930 [20],
and brl 43694 [4] provided excellent relief from chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting. for example, 14 of
15 patients did not experience nausea or vomiting when
given gr38032f along with cytotoxic drugs [10]. the only
adverse effects were headache and mild sedation with
ics205-930 and dry mouth and mild sedation with
gr38032f. therefore, 5-ht3 antagonists appear to be extremely effective antiemetics when given with strongly
emetic anticancer agents.
the mechanism(s) by which the drugs examined in this
study relieve nausea and vomiting are not completely
known [2]. specific dopamine d2 antagonists are thought
to act via central dopamine antagonism in the chemoreceptor trigger zone [15]. metoclopramide is thought to act
at the cortex as well as with receptors in the periphery,
where it induces gastric motility and emptying [16, 29].
this peripheral action may be explained in part by antagonism of dopamine d2 receptors. however, since the role
of dopamine in the control of gut motility seems minor,
other mechanisms must exist through which metoclopramide exerts these effects [29]. it seems likely that this drug
interacts with 5-ht3 receptors located in the enteric system, and it may mediate gastric effects through this mechanism. in addition, since metoclopramide has relatively
high affinity for 5-ht3 recognition sites in rat brain tissues,
some of its antiemetic effects may be due to its interactions
with these cns sites.
the antiemetic effects of the 5-ht3 antagonists appear
to be a consequence of 5 - h t 3 blockade; however, whether
this is due to largely peripheral actions or to both peripheral and central interaction with the receptor remains unclarified. for example, at small doses  xxxd3097xxx  (a potent
stimulant of gastric motility [51) mimics abdominal vagotomy in total-body-irradiated ferrets; that is, retching and
vomiting is delayed by 30 min. higher doses of  xxxd3097xxx 
almost eliminate retching and vomiting for the entire
90-min test period [1]. these results were interpreted as indicating that  xxxd3097xxx  may, in addition to its probable
action at the abdominal vagi, have an important effect in
another area of the body.

in addition to their direct effect on 5-ht transmission,
the 5-ht3 antagonists may also have some modulatory effects on the dopaminergic system. a potent and highly selective 5-ht3 antagonist, gr38032f, has been shown to
modulate hyperactivity resulting from dopamine administration to rats and marmosets [9]. gr38032f was hypothesized to work by interrupting a 5-ht-dopamine-5-ht
loop by which 5-ht serves to facilitate dopaminergic
transmission. perhaps a similar interaction between 5-ht
and dopamine transmission is involved in the reduction of
nausea and vomiting by 5-ht3 antagonists.
however, the direct antagonism of dopamine d2 receptors does not appear to be necessary for effective antiemetic treatment. metoclopramide, which is significantly
less potent at dopamine d2 receptors than are the other
traditional dopamine d 2 antiemetic agents, has also been
shown to be the most effective antiemetic of the group [33].
recent trials suggest that the 5-ht3 antagonists are at least
as effective as metoclopramide in reducing or eliminating
nausea and vomiting resulting from chemotherapy. thus,
it is not apparent that the dopamine d2 antiemetic effects
of metoclopramide are a necessary component of its antiemetic efficacy; its 5-ht3 antagonism alone may be sufficient to control emesis effectively.
finally, radioligand-binding studies may be used as a
screening tool for the selection of clinically useful drugs.
for example, in the present study, two of the 5-ht3 antagonists (zacopride and lilly 278584) were not shown to
have antiemetic effects. these drugs showed a binding pattern similar to those of the demonstrated antiemetics
ics 205-930, mdl 72222, and brl 43694; that is, high affinity for the 5-ht3 site in cortical tissue and inactivity at
the dopamine d2 site in corpus striatum. zacopride shows
an affinity for the 5-ht3 site similar to that of brl 43694.
lilly 278584 is more potent at the site than is m d l 72222.
thus, we would predict that both of these drugs would be
effective in reducing emesis caused by agents such as cisplatin or by total-body radiation.
in summary, this study demonstrates that affinities of
drugs to 5-ht3 and dopamine d 2 sites correlates with their
efficacy as antiemetics. metoclopramide is superior to the
other traditional agents in its antiemetic action and is also
the only traditional agent that displays moderate affinity
for 5-ht3 receptors. clinical trials with the 5-ht3 antagonists
mdl 72222,
ics 205-930,
brl 43694,
and
gr38032f have shown them to be at least equal to, and
probably superior to, metoclopramide in antiemetic efficacy. these data indicate that the  xxxg1116xxx  plays a
novel and important role in the pathophysiology of nausea
and vomiting.
