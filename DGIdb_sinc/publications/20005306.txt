recent years have observed signiﬁcant advances in our understanding of how the  xxxg1377xxx 
 xxxg1478xxx  (tor) controls key cellular processes such as cell survival, growth and proliferation.
consistent with its role in cell proliferation, the mtor pathway is frequently hyperactivated in a number of
human malignancies and is thus considered to be an attractive target for anti-cancer therapy. rapamycin and
its analogs (rapalogs) function as allosteric inhibitors of mtorc1 and are currently used in the treatment of
advanced renal cell carcinoma. rapamycin and its derivatives bind to the small immunophilin  xxxg798xxx  to
inhibit mtorc1 signalling through a poorly understood mechanism. rapamycin/ xxxg798xxx  efﬁciently inhibit
some, but not all, functions of mtor and hence much interest has been placed in the development of drugs
that target the kinase activity of mtor directly. several novel active-site inhibitors of mtor, which inhibit
both mtorc1 and mtorc2, were developed in the last year. in this manuscript, we provide a brief outline of
our current understanding of the mtor signalling pathway and review the molecular underpinnings of the
action of rapamycin and novel active-site mtor inhibitors as well as potential advantages and caveats
associated with the use of these drugs in the treatment of cancer.

1. introduction
1.1. mtor signalling in health and disease
the  xxxg1377xxx  mammalian  xxxg1478xxx 
(mtor) plays a central role in regulating critical cellular processes
such as growth, proliferation, cytoskeletal organization, transcription,
protein synthesis and ribosomal biogenesis. mtor is present in two
distinct protein complexes commonly referred to as mtor complex 1
(mtorc1) and mtor complex 2 (mtorc2; fig. 1). mtorc1 modulates
cap-dependent translation in response to nutrients, hormones and
growth factors and is composed of mtor, the scaffolding protein raptor
(regulatory associated protein of tor), the gtpase beta-subunit like
protein gbetal (also known as mlst8) and the recently identiﬁed deptor
(disheveled, egl-10, pleckstrin [dep] domain containing mtor interacting protein) [1,2]. some of the mtorc1 components are also
present in mtorc2: these include mtor, mlst8 and deptor. other
proteins, like rictor (rapamycin insensitive companion of tor), msin1
(mammalian stress-activated protein kinase ( xxxg1372xxx )-interacting protein) and prr5 (proline-rich protein 5, also known as protor) are found
exclusively in mtorc2 [3–7].
mtorc1 and mtorc2 phosphorylate different substrates to
regulate distinct cellular functions. for instance, mtorc2 phosphorylates akt, sgk1 and pkc (members of the agc kinase family) which
control cell survival and cytoskeletal organization [1,8–10]. mtorc1,

on the other hand, stimulates cell growth and proliferation by
increasing cap-dependent translation initiation and this is mediated
by its two major downstream targets: the  xxxg692xxx -binding proteins (4ebps) and s6 kinases ( xxxg1989xxx  and s6k2) [11]. s6 kinases are believed to
control translation by modulating the activity of their downstream
targets including ribosomal protein s6, eukaryotic initiation factor 4b
(eif4b) and  xxxg1689xxx  protein ( xxxg1689xxx ) [12]. 4e-bps
are a family of small molecular weight translational repressors that
include  xxxg693xxx , 4e-bp2, and 4e-bp3. these proteins suppress
translation of a subset of transcripts referred to as “ xxxg692xxx -sensitive
mrnas” by competing with eif4g for binding to  xxxg692xxx , and thereby
preventing formation of the  xxxg692xxx  initiation complex [13]. eif4esensitive mrnas are characterized by long and complex 5′utr
regions and encode proliferation and survival promoting proteins
such as cyclins, c-myc and  xxxg251xxx  [14,15]. due to the complexity of
their 5′utrs,  xxxg692xxx -sensitive mrnas are translated less efﬁciently
than mrnas bearing short, unstructured 5′utrs, such as mrnas
encoding housekeeping proteins [16–18]. the most extensively
studied and best-understood member of the 4e-bp family is  xxxg693xxx .
upon activation, mtorc1 phosphorylates thr37 and thr46 on  xxxg693xxx , which acts as a priming event essential for the phosphorylation
of ser65 and thr70 leading to the release of  xxxg692xxx  and subsequent
assembly of the  xxxg692xxx  complex [19,20]. mtorc1 is also thought to
modulate protein synthesis indirectly through the activation of tif-ia
and consequent stimulation of transcription of ribosomal rna and
ribosomal biogenesis [21], as well as through phosphorylation of
eif4g [22].
in addition to its well-established role in translation, the mtorc1
pathway is suggested to play a role in a variety of important cellular

fig. 1. schematic representation of mtor signalling pathway. mammalian  xxxg1478xxx  (mtor) exists in two distinct complexes: mtorc1 and mtorc2. mtorc1 is activated
by various extra- and intracellular cues which regulate a multitude of signalling pathways including pi3k/akt,  xxxg2337xxx / xxxg2338xxx / xxxg1954xxx ,  xxxg2218xxx /ampk and vam6/rag gtpases. in yeast,
amino acids activate vam6/vps39 (the guanine nucleotide exchange factor) that loads gtp onto gtr1/gtr2 gtpases (the yeast homologs of rag gtpases in mammals). in turn, in
mammals, rag gtpases are believed to activate mtorc1 by recruiting this complex into close proximity of  xxxg1954xxx , a small gtpase that switches mtorc1 signalling on through a poorly
understood mechanism. gtp loading onto  xxxg1954xxx  is controlled by the tuberous sclerosis complex that comprises both the scaffolding protein,  xxxg2337xxx  and the gtpase activating protein
(gap),  xxxg2338xxx .  xxxg2338xxx  is phosphorylated at multiple sites by akt and ampk. phosphorylation of  xxxg2338xxx  by akt and ampk has been proposed to inhibit (block) or activate (arrow) the
 xxxg2337xxx / xxxg2338xxx  complex, respectively. mtorc1 is believed to modulate protein synthesis through activation of s6ks and inhibition of 4e-bps. several additional downstream targets of
mtorc1 have been described over the years and their proposed roles in mediating functional outputs of mtorc1 pathway are outlined. kinase inhibitors that directly or indirectly
affect mtorc1 signalling are shown in red. abbreviations: mtor: mammalian  xxxg1478xxx ; astori: active-site mtor inhibitors; aicar: aminoimidazole carboxamide

processes. for instance, mtorc1 inhibits autophagy, an evolutionarily
conserved catabolic process triggered by nutrient deprivation in
which cellular organelles and/or long-lived proteins are degraded by
the lysosomal machinery [23]. recent studies revealed that this is
achieved through the phosphorylation and subsequent repression of
the autophagy promoting factors unc-51-like kinase 1 (ulk1) and
autophagy-related gene 13 (atg13) [24–26]. an emerging body of
data suggests that mtorc1 also plays an important role in the
regulation of lipid synthesis and mitochondrial metabolism and
biogenesis. at the molecular level, the effects of mtorc1 on lipid
homeostasis are thought to be mediated by lipogenic transcription

factors (e.g. sterol regulatory element binding protein 1 (srebp1) [27]
and  xxxg1807xxx  ( xxxg1807xxx ) [28]), and
a phosphatidic acid phosphatase, lipin-1 [29]. mtorc1 stimulates
mitochondrial biogenesis and oxidative metabolism [30] possibly by
modulating the interaction between  xxxg1807xxx  coactivator 1 (pgc1-alpha)
and the transcription factor yin-yang 1 (yy1) [31]. mtor was also
shown to phosphorylate clip-170/restin, which is a member of a
family of conserved microtubule associated proteins [32]. the
phosphorylation of clip-170/restin was abrogated by rapamycin,
indicating a possible role for mtorc1 in cytoskeletal organisation
[32]. additional substrates of mtorc1 include hif1alpha [33] and stat3

r.j.o. dowling et al. / biochimica et biophysica acta 1804 (2010) 433–439

[34]. albeit the precise role of these substrates in mtorc1 signalling
needs to be established, these ﬁndings implicate the mtorc1 pathway
in transcriptional regulation during hypoxia and inﬂammation.
mtorc1 signalling is regulated by a multitude of signalling
cascades (depicted in fig. 1). for instance, the tuberous sclerosis
complex ( xxxg2337xxx / xxxg2338xxx ) functions upstream of mtorc1 to inhibit
signalling through this complex (see for example [35] for review).
consistent with the inhibitory effect of  xxxg2337xxx / xxxg2338xxx  on mtorc1,
overexpression of  xxxg2338xxx  drastically reduces the phosphorylation of
mtorc1 targets: 4e-bps and s6ks [36]. phosphorylation of 4e-bps and
s6ks is also dramatically reduced by overexpression of a recently
identiﬁed component of mtorc1 termed pras40 (for proline rich
akt substrate 40 kda) ([37–41]). it is not entirely clear how
overexpression of pras40 inhibits the phosphorylation of 4e-bps
and  xxxg1989xxx : early reports suggested pras40 inhibited mtorc1 by acting
upstream of this complex [37,38] but other mechanisms may also
exist. pras40 binds to raptor via a tor signalling (tos) motif,
commonly found in other mtorc1 targets: 4e-bps, s6ks and hif1alpha
and is subject to phosphorylation by mtorc1 at multiple sites,
including rapamycin-sensitive (ser 183 and ser 221) and rapamycininsensitive (ser 212) residues [40,41]. the observation that pras40
contains a tos motif and is itself a target for phosphorylation by
mtorc1 [39,41,42] suggests that pras40 is not an upstream
regulator, but rather, a downstream target of mtorc1 which inhibits
mtorc1 signalling by competing with 4e-bps and s6ks for binding
and phosphorylation by mtorc1. the exact mechanism whereby
pras40 exerts its inhibitory effects on mtorc1 remains unclear to
date and further work is required to elucidate the signiﬁcance of its
phosphorylation by mtorc1.
mtorc1 signalling is frequently dysregulated in cancer [1,43]. loss
or inactivation of tumor suppressors such as p53,  xxxg2218xxx , pten, and
 xxxg2337xxx /2, which antagonize pi3k-dependent activation of mtorc1, can
promote tumorigenesis via increased signalling through mtorc1
[44–47]. moreover, increased levels and/or phosphorylation of
downstream targets of mtorc1 have been reported in various
human malignancies in which they correlate with tumor aggressiveness and poor prognosis [1,43,48].  xxxg1989xxx  is reported to be overexpressed in breast cancer [49] and  xxxg693xxx  is downregulated and/or
hyperphosphorylated (i.e. inactivated) in breast, ovarian, and other
cancers [50–52]. accordingly, in our recent study we show that 4e-bps
act as tumor suppressors in p53-null mice and that the loss of 4e-bps
results in premature senescence in ﬁbroblasts derived from p53-wild
type mice [53]. alterations in components of the  xxxg692xxx  complex have
also been linked to a wide variety of human malignancies. for
example, high levels and/or hyperactivity of  xxxg692xxx  have been reported
in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, lung, colon, breast cancer,
leukemias and lymphomas [54–57]. taken together, these ﬁndings
link aberrant mtorc1 signalling with dysregulated translational
control in cancer. as a result, mtorc1 has emerged as an important
target for anti-cancer therapy.
2. mtor inhibitors
2.1. rapamycin and rapalogs
rapamycin is a naturally occurring macrolide triene antibiotic that
acts as a speciﬁc, allosteric inhibitor of mtorc1 [11,58,59]. although
rapamycin has been widely used to study mtorc1 signalling for more
than a decade, the molecular underpinnings of rapamycin's actions
are still poorly understood. rapamycin associates with its intracellular
receptor,  xxxg798xxx  ( xxxd3271xxx -binding protein of 12 kda) and the resulting
complex interacts with the frb ( xxxg798xxx -rapamycin binding) domain
located in the c-terminus of mtor [60]. binding of rapamycin/
 xxxg798xxx  to the frb domain of mtor precludes the binding of mtor to
raptor and this is believed to uncouple mtorc1 from its substrates
(e.g. 4e-bps and s6ks) [61,62]. a recent study using high micromolar

435

doses of the rapamycin analogue  xxxd3307xxx  indicated that
rapamycin and its derivatives can directly bind to the frb domain
of mtor, thus disputing the absolute requirement of  xxxg798xxx  for
rapamycin-mediated inhibition of mtorc1 signalling [63].
in contrast to mtorc1, mtorc2 does not bind rapamycin/ xxxg798xxx 
and this is thought to confer mtorc2 its resistance to acute
rapamycin treatment. mtorc2 is sensitive, however, to prolonged
rapamycin treatment which (as proposed by [64]) interferes with de
novo assembly of mtorc2. according to this model binding of
rapamycin/ xxxg798xxx  to mtor impedes the subsequent binding of the
mtorc2-speciﬁc components msin1 and rictor which are required for
signalling downstream of mtorc2. this model is corroborated by the
observation that rapamycin treatment leads to dephosphorylation
and sub-cellular re-localization of msin1 and rictor in non-immortalized
human diploid ﬁbroblasts and nih 3t3 cells [65]. however, these
effects are cell type speciﬁc and the factor(s) that render mtorc2
sensitive to rapamycin in some but not all cell types still need to be
determined [64].
the ability of rapamycin to suppress both cellular proliferation and
growth (through inhibition mtorc1) suggested that rapamycin and
its analogs could serve as potent anti-cancer agents [59,66]. this
observation prompted the development of rapamycin analogs
(rapalogs), which share the mechanism of action of rapamycin but
display improved pharmacokinetic properties. presently, rapamycin
and several rapalogs are in clinical development for the treatment of a
wide variety of human malignancies. it has been reported that
rapamycin and rapalogs effectively inhibit cell proliferation and
angiogenesis in some human tumors [67,68]. at the molecular level,
this could be partly explained by the mtorc1/ xxxg693xxx  mediated
suppression of translation of “ xxxg692xxx -sensitive” mrnas such as cyclin
d1,  xxxg368xxx  and vegf.
2.2. molecular mechanisms underlying the relative inefﬁcacy of
rapamycin and rapalogs in cancer treatment
the us fda (united states food and drug administration) has
recently approved the rapamycin analogs  xxxd3307xxx  ( xxxd3307xxx ) and
 xxxd2072xxx  ( xxxd2072xxx ) for the treatment of advanced stage renal cell
carcinoma and sarcoma, respectively [58,68,69]. however, the efﬁcacy
of rapamycin and rapalogs as broad based monotherapies for cancer
does not appear as promising as initially expected [54,58]. this has
been attributed to the inability of rapamycin to inhibit the
phosphorylation of 4e-bps in an effective and sustained manner and
thus suppress translation of  xxxg692xxx -sensitive mrnas (fig. 2). the
relative inefﬁcacy of rapamycin in cancer treatment has been
attributed to rapamycin-mediated upregulation of pi(3)k/akt phosphorylation resulting from the loss of the negative-feedback loop from
 xxxg1989xxx  to  xxxg1198xxx . [54,58,70,71]. upon activation, mtorc1 activates  xxxg1989xxx ,
which in turn phosphorylates inhibitory sites (i.e. ser 636/639) on the
 xxxg1194xxx  substrate-1 ( xxxg1198xxx ), thereby suppressing  xxxg1198xxx 
mediated activation of the pi3k/akt pathway. inhibition of
mtorc1 by rapamycin results in the attenuation of negative feedback
to  xxxg1198xxx , leading to increased akt activity. the full activation of akt
requires two phosphorylation events, on ser473 which lies in its
hydrophobic motif, and on thr308 within its activation loop. pdk1 has
long been known to be the major kinase for thr308 [72]. recently, it
was revealed that mtorc2 is also implicated in the activation of akt,
through phosphorylation of ser473 [9,73]. as mentioned above,
mtorc2 is rapamycin-insensitive in the majority of cancer cell lines
[64,74], suggesting that mtorc2-dependent phosphorylation of akt
on ser473 still persists during rapamycin treatment.
taken together these ﬁndings indicate that at the molecular level,
rapamycin treatment leads to hyperactivation of akt through loss of
the mtorc1/ xxxg1989xxx / xxxg1198xxx /pi3k negative feedback loop, which in some
types of cancer is further reinforced by the inability of rapamycin to
efﬁciently suppress mtorc2 signalling towards akt. accordingly,

fig. 2. diagram depicting differences in the effects of the active-site mtor inhibitors and rapamycin on mtor signalling. active-site mtor inhibitors suppress the phosphorylation of
4e-bps on ser65 to a higher extent than rapamycin. furthermore, these compounds completely abolish the phosphorylation of rapamycin-insensitive thr37/46 sites on 4e-bps. in
turn, the effects of the active-site mtor inhibitors on s6 kinase ( xxxg1989xxx ) activation through inhibition of thr389 phosphorylation are comparable to those of rapamycin. prolonged
rapamycin treatment leads to a loss of the negative feedback between  xxxg1989xxx  and  xxxg1198xxx , resulting in increased phosphorylation of akt on thr308 and its subsequent activation. it is
suggested that the active-site mtor inhibitors counteract the effect of the loss of the negative feedback between  xxxg1989xxx  and  xxxg1198xxx , by inhibiting mtorc2 dependent phosphorylation
of akt on ser473. intriguingly, it has been reported that in a limited number of cell lines, mtorc2 signalling towards akt is inhibited by prolonged rapamycin treatment (⁎).
relatively limited success of rapamycin as an anti-cancer agent has been attributed to activation of the akt pathway as well as the inability of rapamycin to inhibit phosphorylation
of 4e-bps.

phosphorylation of akt is reportedly increased in tumors derived
from patients treated with  xxxd2072xxx  [66]. the activation of aktdependent pro-survival mechanisms may not only hinder the antineoplastic activity of rapamycin, but also promote tumorigenesis and
lead to resistance of tumor cells to other anti-cancer agents.
2.3. new generation of mtor inhibitors: targeting the active site
in addition to the emerging role of mtorc2 in the activation of
akt, it was recently shown that mtorc2 activity is necessary for
pten-dependent tumorigenesis. a study by guertin at al., [75]
revealed that mtorc2 signalling is necessary for the development
of prostate cancer caused by pten deletion. intriguingly, mtorc2
activity was dispensable for the function of normal prostate epithelial
cells. these ﬁndings highlight the importance of developing speciﬁc
inhibitors of mtorc2 in order to efﬁciently target mtor signalling in
cancer. a number of active-site mtor inhibitors have now been
developed, which speciﬁcally suppress mtor signalling by competing
with atp for binding to the kinase domain of mtor [76–79]. these
compounds, pp242,  xxxd3403xxx , wye-354 and  xxxd2585xxx  suppress both
mtorc1 and mtorc2 activity with signiﬁcant selectivity over
phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (pi3k) isoforms and display more
dramatic effects on cell growth, proliferation, cell cycle and capdependent translation than rapamycin [76–79]. furthermore, it was
shown that  xxxd3403xxx , unlike rapamycin, potently induces autophagy in
mouse embryonic ﬁbroblasts [78]. as expected, active-site mtor
inhibitors, but not rapamycin, suppressed mtorc2-mediated phosphorylation of akt on ser473 [76,78]. surprisingly, the active-site
mtor inhibitors inhibited cell proliferation, growth and cell cycle
progression to the same extent in wild type and mouse embryonic
ﬁbroblasts lacking rictor or msin1 which are deﬁcient in mtorc2
activity [76,78]. these ﬁndings indicate that the effects of the activesite mtor inhibitors are not mediated by mtorc2. furthermore, the
active-site mtor inhibitors and rapamycin reduced the phosphorylation of s6ks and its substrate, ribosomal protein rps6, to the same
extent [76–78]. in stark contrast, the effects of active site mtor
inhibitors on  xxxg693xxx  phosphorylation were much stronger than
rapamycin. rapamycin has little effect on the phosphorylation of
thr37 and thr46 on  xxxg693xxx , whilst  xxxd2585xxx , pp242 and  xxxd3403xxx 

completely inhibited the phosphorylation of these residues in vivo
[76–78]. in addition,  xxxd2585xxx , pp242 and  xxxd3403xxx  caused a greater
reduction in ser65 phosphorylation compared to rapamycin [76–78].
these ﬁndings are consistent with recent studies showing that  xxxg693xxx 
phosphorylation is resistant to rapamycin in several cancer cell lines,
especially after prolonged treatment [58,70].
thus, the ability of active-site mtor inhibitors to exert more
prominent effects on mtor functional outputs than rapamycin is
largely due to their ability to suppress rapamycin-resistant mtorc1
signalling towards 4e-bps [76–78]. a question that remains unanswered is how does rapamycin cause complete deactivation of  xxxg1989xxx ,
while having only a moderate effect on  xxxg693xxx  phosphorylation? one
possible explanation to this conundrum is that mtorc1 binds to 4ebps and s6ks with a different afﬁnity and/or conformation, wherein
the rapamycin-mediated structural changes in mtorc1 are sufﬁcient
to disrupt its association with s6ks, but not with 4e-bps [80,81]. this
would allow mtor to still signal to  xxxg693xxx  while simultaneously
loosing its ability to phosphorylate  xxxg1989xxx . whilst assessing the binding
afﬁnity of the mtorc1 complex to its substrates is experimentally
challenging, the observation that raptor binds more efﬁciently to  xxxg693xxx  than  xxxg1989xxx  supports this model of rapamycin-resistant signalling to
 xxxg693xxx  [80,82]. alternatively, it has been proposed that kinases other
than mtor regulate the phosphorylation of  xxxg693xxx  on thr 37/46 [83].
thus, the discrepancy in the effects of rapamycin and the active-site
mtor inhibitors on the phosphorylation of 4e-bps and s6ks, could
also be explained by the inability of rapamycin to inhibit the kinase
responsible for the phosphorylation of 4e-bps on thr 37/46. finally, it
is plausible that the differential effects of the active-site mtor
inhibitors and rapamycin on the phosphorylation of s6ks and 4e-bps
are the consequence of the activation of a hitherto unidentiﬁed
phosphatase. undoubtedly, future studies will be necessary to answer
the conundrum of differential sensitivity of s6ks and 4e-bps to the
active-site mtor inhibitors and rapamycin.
2.4. new active-site mtor inhibitors in cancer treatment
while new active-site mtor inhibitors have been important in
elucidating the molecular mechanisms of mtorc1 and 2 signalling,
their most critical role may be in the treatment of cancer. due to the

r.j.o. dowling et al. / biochimica et biophysica acta 1804 (2010) 433–439

existence of the rapamycin-resistant mtorc2 complex and its role in
akt activation, active-site mtor inhibitors have the potential to be
potent anti-cancer agents. these new inhibitors may function as more
effective anti-cancer therapies because they counteract the activation
of akt, which can occur as a result of rapamycin-mediated disruption
of the mtor/ xxxg1989xxx / xxxg1198xxx  negative feed back loop. to date,  xxxd2585xxx ,
pp242 and  xxxd3403xxx  have not been tested in animal models for the
inhibition of tumor growth. however, new active-site inhibitors
(way-600, wye-687, and wye-354) have been developed by wyeth
(pearl river, ny) and tested on a variety of cancer cells in vitro and in
vivo [79]. in a xenograft model, the mtor active-site inhibitor wye354 signiﬁcantly inhibited the growth of tumors established with
 xxxg1682xxx -mm2 prostate cancer cells, indicating that these new inhibitors
represent future potential anti-cancer agents [79].
when considering compounds as anti-cancer agents, it is important to identify factors that may be responsible for governing
sensitivity or resistance to treatment. for example, increased
activation of akt and over-expression of  xxxg1989xxx  have correlated with
rapamycin sensitivity [84,85]. in addition, loss of the tumor
suppressor pten is thought to increase the sensitivity of cells and
tumors to treatment with rapamycin [86]. however using pten status
as a marker of sensitivity to rapamycin treatment has been somewhat
unreliable in human patients [54]. the level of  xxxg692xxx  activation may
correlate with resistance to rapamycin as over-expression of  xxxg692xxx , or
decreased expression of its inhibitor,  xxxg693xxx , have been associated
with poor responses to rapamycin based therapies [87,88].
in addition to identifying markers of rapamycin sensitivity, it is of
paramount importance to identify biomarkers to assess the efﬁcacy of
rapamycin and other mtor inhibitors in human patients. in general,
inhibition of mtor activity can be monitored by assessing the
phosphorylation status of its downstream targets,  xxxg1989xxx  and  xxxg693xxx .
indeed, several clinical studies have demonstrated a decrease in the
phosphorylation of  xxxg1989xxx  and  xxxg693xxx  in skin, blood, and tumor samples
from cancer patients undergoing therapy with rapamycin derivatives
[66,89]. however, the existence of rapamycin-resistant phosphorylation sites on  xxxg693xxx  renders the use of  xxxg693xxx  as a biomarker for
rapamycin based anti-cancer therapies problematic.
3. conclusions and future directions
the dysregulation of mtor signalling is implicated in a number of
human diseases including cancer. consequently, a great deal of
research has focused on elucidating the mechanisms linking mtor
signalling to the control of cell growth, proliferation, differentiation
and transformation. despite recent advances in the understanding of
mtor structure and function, much work still needs to be done. the
development of the novel active-site mtor kinase inhibitors has
already yielded interesting ﬁndings on mtorc1 and mtorc2
signalling. the use of these mtor inhibitors will likely reveal new
targets for phosphorylation by mtor and further our current
understanding of mtor signalling and its role in health and disease.
furthermore, the optimization of new active-site mtor inhibitors for
use in patients and the identiﬁcation of biomarkers of efﬁcacy of
mtor inhibition in patients will be key for the effective treatment of
