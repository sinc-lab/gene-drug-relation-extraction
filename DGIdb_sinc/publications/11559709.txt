an elevated plasma concentration of homocysteine, a sulfurcontaining amino acid derived from methionine, has been recognized as an independent risk factor for the development of
vascular disease (1). methionine is adenylated by methionine
adenosyltransferase to form  xxxd3156xxx , an important biological methyl donor. numerous methyltransferases
catalyze the transfer of a methyl group from  xxxd3156xxx  to a methyl acceptor, producing a methylated product
and s- xxxd3157xxx , which is subsequently hydro-

lyzed to form adenosine and homocysteine. homocysteine has
several possible fates: 1) remethylation to form methionine via
either the  xxxg1479xxx  (using
n5-methyltetrahydrofolate as a methyl donor) or betaine:homocysteine methyltransferase (using betaine as a methyl donor);
2) catabolism by the transsulfuration pathway, ultimately
forming cysteine; 3) export to the extracellular space. two
 xxxd3049xxx -dependent enzymes comprise the transsulfuration
pathway: cystathionine ␤-synthase, which condenses homocysteine with serine to form cystathionine, and cystathionine
␥-lyase, which cleaves cystathionine to cysteine, nh4⫹, and
␣-ketobutyrate.
altered flux through the remethylation or transsulfuration
pathways as a result of genetic mutations or impaired vitamin
status has been shown to affect plasma homocysteine levels (2,
3). in recent years it has also become apparent that certain
hormones can affect homocysteine metabolism. it has been
shown that hypothyroid patients tend to have elevated plasma
homocysteine and that these levels are normalized when thyroid levels are restored by thyroxine treatment (4, 5). estrogen
therapy for post-menopausal women has been shown to lower
plasma homocysteine (6). altered homocysteine metabolism
has been observed in diabetes mellitus. diabetic patients
(types 1 and 2) with signs of kidney dysfunction (i.e. elevated
creatinine levels) tend to have increased plasma homocysteine
(7). however, in the absence of renal dysfunction, patients with
type 1 diabetes exhibit decreased plasma homocysteine relative to normal subjects (8). studies in our laboratory have
shown that plasma homocysteine is decreased in the  xxxd3249xxx -diabetic rat (a model for type 1 diabetes mellitus).
insulin treatment increased plasma homocysteine in these diabetic animals (9). we have also shown that enzyme activities
of the hepatic transsulfuration pathway are increased during
uncontrolled diabetes. these changes in activity were reversed
by insulin treatment (9).
the regulatory effects of glucagon on amino acid metabolism
are well known. it can, for example, activate the glycine cleavage system (10), stimulate the y⫹ transporter (11), and induce
the five urea-cycle enzymes (12). patients with a glucagonoma
have diminished plasma amino acid levels, which are related to
increased clearance by the liver (13). in light of the broad
effects of glucagon on amino acid metabolism, it appears likely
that homocysteine metabolism would be similarly regulated,
given that it is a product of the metabolism of dietary essential
methionine, and a precursor to cysteine. in addition, plasma
glucagon is frequently elevated in type 1 diabetes (14). we
therefore examined the role of glucagon in regulating homocysteine metabolism in the rat. we show that glucagon treatment
lowered plasma homocysteine levels and those of related amino
acids. glucagon administration elevated the activity of both

an elevated plasma level of homocysteine is a risk
factor for the development of cardiovascular disease.
the purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of
glucagon on homocysteine metabolism in the rat. male
sprague-dawley rats were treated with 4 mg/kg/day (3
injections per day) glucagon for 2 days while control
rats received vehicle injections. glucagon treatment resulted in a 30% decrease in total plasma homocysteine
and increased hepatic activities of  xxxg928xxx , cystathionine ␤-synthase, and cystathionine ␥-lyase. enzyme activities of the remethylation
pathway were unaffected. the 90% elevation in activity
of cystathionine ␤-synthase was accompanied by a 2-fold
increase in its mrna level. hepatocytes prepared from
glucagon-injected rats exported less homocysteine,
when incubated with methionine, than did hepatocytes
of saline-treated rats. flux through cystathionine ␤-synthase was increased 5-fold in hepatocytes isolated from
glucagon-treated rats as determined by production of
14
co2 and ␣-[1-14c]ketobutyrate from l-[1-14c]methionine. methionine transport was elevated 2-fold in hepatocytes isolated from glucagon-treated rats resulting in
increased hepatic methionine levels. hepatic concentrations of  xxxd3156xxx  and s- xxxd3157xxx , allosteric activators of cystathionine ␤-synthase,
were also increased following glucagon treatment.
these results indicate that glucagon can regulate
plasma homocysteine through its effects on the hepatic
transsulfuration pathway.

in vivo effects of glucagon on homocysteine metabolism
enzymes of the hepatic transsulfuration pathway. increased
hepatic cystathionine ␤-synthase mrna was also observed. in
addition, higher sam1 and sah concentrations provide positive allosteric modulation of cystathionine ␤-synthase, the committed step for the conversion of homocysteine to cysteine. the
increased enzymes and positive effectors of the transsulfuration pathway could therefore provide a viable mechanism for
the decrease in plasma homocysteine by stimulating flux
through this pathway. such an increased transsulfuration flux
was directly demonstrated in isolated hepatocytes. finally, we
report novel data on the hepatic concentration of the relevant
amino acids. in particular, we demonstrate that glucagon
treatment, which decreases plasma levels of most amino acids,
including methionine, actually results in an increase in hepatic
levels of this amino acid. this, which would also contribute to
the increased transsulfuration flux, was brought about by
marked increase in methionine transport into hepatocytes.

(22), and cystathionine ␥-lyase (23). for the determination of betaine:
homocysteine methyltransferase and cystathionine ␤-synthase activity,
methionine and cystathionine, respectively, were measured by reversephase hplc (24). protein concentration was determined using the
 xxxd2444xxx  method (25), after solubilization with  xxxd1835xxx , using bovine
 xxxg124xxx  as a standard (26). all assays were demonstrated to be
linear with respect to time and protein concentration. enzyme activities
are expressed as nanomoles of product per milligram of protein per
minute.
homocysteine export from isolated hepatocytes—hepatocytes were
isolated by the method of berry et al. (27), and viability was assessed by
0.2% (w/v) trypan blue exclusion. viability was at least 95% in all
cases. hepatocytes were preincubated for 20 min at 4 – 6 mg of dry
weight of cells/ml (1 ml of final volume) in krebs-henseleit medium
equilibrated with 95% o2/5% co2 and containing 1.25% (w/v) bsa.
following preincubation, 1 mm methionine was added and cells were
incubated for another 30 min. cells were gassed with 95% o2/5% co2 at
the beginning of preincubation and at the addition of methionine. at the
end of the incubation, the contents of the flasks were immediately
centrifuged at 14,000 ⫻ g for 2 min to sediment the cells. the supernatant was then frozen at ⫺20 °c until analyzed. homocysteine export
was determined by subtracting a zero time point and is expressed as
nanomoles of homocysteine per milligram of hepatocytes per 30 min.

co2 production from isolated hepatocytes—in a separate series of
experiments, hepatocytes were incubated with 1 mm l-[1-14c]methionine (american radiolabeled chemicals, inc., st. louis, mo) in the
presence and absence of propargylglycine and ␣-cyanocinnimate. following the addition of methionine, flasks were incubated for 30 min,
after which they were equipped with rubber septa with suspended
plastic center wells containing ncs tissue solubilizer. incubations were
terminated by injection of 0.3 ml of 30% (w/v) perchloric acid through
the septa, and 14co2 was collected for 1 h. radioactivity was then
measured by placing the center wells in scintillation vials containing
omnifluor scintillation fluid. to collect 14co2 from intermediate ␣-ketoacids, a new center well containing ncs was then added to each flask
and 0.3 ml of 30% (w/v)  xxxd2298xxx  was injected through the
septa (28). 14co2 was collected for 1 h and measured as described above.
methionine transport—methionine transport into isolated hepatocytes was measured as described by salter et al. (29). following a
20-min preincubation period, [1-14c]methionine was added to a final
concentration of 0.5 mm (0.2 ␮ci). at 5, 35, 65, 95, and 125 s following
the addition of methionine, 1-ml aliquots were transferred to 1.5-ml
microcentrifuge tubes containing 0.25 ml of silicone oil mixture (2:1
(v/v) dow corning 550 silicone oil and dinonyl phthalate) layered on top
of 0.1 ml of 6% (v/v) perchloric acid. the tubes were centrifuged at
14,000 ⫻ g for 15 s to sediment cells through the silicone oil and into the
acid layer, leaving the extracellular fluid on top of the oil. following
centrifugation, the tubes were frozen in liquid nitrogen and then the
tubes were cut at the end of the silicone oil layer. the bottom layer,
containing the intracellular [14c]methionine, was placed in a scintillation vial containing 10 ml of omnifluor scintillation mixture, and radioactivity was determined by a scintillation counter. the volume of
extracellular space that was carried through the silicone oil was determined by measuring radioactivity in the bottom layer following cell
incubation with [carboxyl-14c]inulin. this value was used to correct
rates of methionine transport. methionine transport rates were determined by subtracting 5-s rates, representing primarily amino acid
binding to membranes, from the values obtained at subsequent time
points.
 xxxd3156xxx  and s- xxxd3157xxx  determination—sam and sah were measured in the liver using the method of
wagner2 with minor modifications. freeze-clamped liver was quickly
added to 5 volumes of 8% cold trichloroacetic acid. samples were homogenized with a polytron for 10 s and were placed on ice for 10 min.
the samples were then centrifuged for 10 min at 13,000 ⫻ g. the
supernatant was retained and analyzed by hplc using a vydac c18
column (model 2187p54) that was equilibrated with 96% 50 mm
nah2po4, 10 mm heptane sulfonic acid (adjusted to ph 3.2 with concentrated  xxxd3258xxx ), and 4% acetonitrile. a 15-min gradient from 4%
to 20% acetonitrile was used to separate sam and sah. peaks were
monitored by uv detection at 258 nm and quantified using a 3390a
hewlett packard integrator.
isolation of total rna and northern blot analysis—total rna was
isolated from rat livers by the acid guanidinium thiocyanate-phenolchloroform method as described by chomczynski and sacchi (30). 15 ␮g

chemicals—injectable glucagon was obtained from eli lilly canada
inc. (toronto, canada). all other chemicals were obtained from sigma
chemical co. (st. louis, mo) unless otherwise noted.
animals—all procedures were approved by memorial university’s
institutional animal care committee and were in accordance with
guidelines of the canadian council on animal care. male spraguedawley rats (supplied from our university’s breeding colony) weighing
between 225 and 275 g were used in all studies. animals were placed in
individual cages and exposed to a 12-h light/dark cycle beginning with
light at 8:00 a.m. the animals ate commercial rodent chow (20% crude
protein; prolab威 rmh 3000 rat chow) ad libitum and had free access to
water.
glucagon treatment followed the procedure of snodgrass et al. (12).
glucagon (4 mg/kg/day, subcutaneously) was administered in three
equal daily doses (at 8:00 a.m., 4:00 p.m., and 12:00 midnight) for 2 days
while control rats received the vehicle (eli lilly canada inc). two hours
following the last injection, animals were anesthetized with 65 mg/kg
intraperitoneal sodium pentobarbital. following a midline abdominal
incision, a blood sample was collected from the abdominal aorta. the
liver was then rapidly removed, and a portion was freeze-clamped at
⫺70 °c while the remaining tissue was placed in ice-cold 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer (ph 6.9). heparinized tubes containing the blood
samples were placed on ice until plasma was separated by centrifugation in a clinical centrifuge (15 min, 3700 ⫻ g). the plasma was then
frozen (⫺20 °c) for later use. fresh tissues were diluted 1:5 with phosphate buffer and then homogenized with a polytron (brinkman instruments, toronto, canada) for 20 s at 50% output. homogenates were
centrifuged at 18,000 ⫻ g at 4 °c for 30 min, and the supernatant was
retained. all enzyme assays were carried out on this 18,000 ⫻ g,
post-mitochondrial supernatant.
analytical procedures—total homocysteine and cysteine concentrations were determined in plasma and liver using reverse-phase hplc
and fluorescence detection of ammonium 7-fluoro 2-oxa-1,3- xxxd3045xxx -4sulfonate thiol adducts, using the method of vester and rasmussen
(15). for amino acid determination, plasma and freeze-clamped liver
were first deproteinized with 10% sulfosalicylic acid. following centrifugation, the resulting supernatant was adjusted to ph 2.2 with lithium
citrate buffer. the samples were then analyzed on a beckman 121 mb
amino acid analyzer using benson d-x, 0.25 cation xchange resin and
a single-column, three-buffer lithium method as per beckman 121mbtb-017 application notes. results were quantitated using a hewlett
packard computing integrator model 3395a. plasma glucose concentrations were determined enzymatically (16). plasma insulin and glucagon levels were measured by linco research inc. (st. charles, mo)
using rat insulin and glucagon, respectively, as standards.
we measured the activities of enzymes responsible for the remethylation of homocysteine to methionine:  xxxg1479xxx  (17), betaine:homocysteine methyltransferase (18), and  xxxg1475xxx  (19). four enzymes that catabolize methionine
conversion to cysteine were also measured:  xxxd3156xxx  synthase (20),  xxxg928xxx  (21), cystathionine ␤-synthase

results

alterations in plasma and liver amino acids following glucagon treatment—table i gives information on body weight,
food intake, plasma glucose, plasma insulin, and plasma glucagon. two-day glucagon treatment did not affect weight gain
in male rats. likewise, there was no change in food intake
following glucagon treatment. therefore, none of the metabolic
changes observed can be attributed to alterations in vitamin or
amino acid intakes. plasma glucose was increased by 80% (as
expected) following glucagon administration. plasma glucagon
was increased 35-fold versus control rats, and there was no
change in plasma insulin.
total plasma homocysteine levels were decreased by 30% by
glucagon treatment (table ii). this is the first report, to our
knowledge, of the homocysteine-lowering effects of glucagon.
table ii also shows the effects of the glucagon treatment on
plasma and liver concentrations of the other amino acids involved in sulfur amino acid metabolism. all plasma amino
acids shown were significantly decreased by glucagon treatment. hepatic amino acid levels are also reported. liver homocysteine and glycine levels were significantly decreased by
glucagon treatment, whereas the concentration of taurine was
increased. no change was observed in the hepatic levels of
methionine, cysteine, and serine. however, calculation of intracellular amino acid concentrations revealed increased methionine and taurine in the glucagon-treated rat, whereas intracellular homocysteine was decreased.

hepatocytes isolated from glucagon-treated rats export less
homocysteine—the liver is the central organ in sulfur amino
acid metabolism. it contains a full complement of enzymes
involved in the methionine cycle and the transsulfuration pathway and is the site of 85% of all methylation reactions in the
body (32). in light of this, it is reasonable to assume that
alterations in hepatic homocysteine metabolism would have a
profound effect on circulating levels of this atherogenic amino
acid. we therefore measured homocysteine output by isolated
hepatocytes. previously, our laboratory has showed that the
half-maximal rate of homocysteine export occurs at a methionine concentration of 0.44 mm and is linear for at least 60 min
(28). a methionine concentration of 1 mm was chosen for all
experiments. following incubation with methionine, hepatocytes isolated from the glucagon-treated rats exported less than
half as much homocysteine as the control hepatocytes (fig. 1).
our earlier studies have shown that addition of serine (a substrate for cystathionine ␤-synthase), together with methionine,
reduced homocysteine export (28). we therefore undertook experiments with both serine and methionine in the incubation
medium. serine incubation decreased homocysteine export
from the control hepatocytes by 50%. however, serine did not
reduce, any further, the homocysteine export of hepatocytes
from glucagon-treated animals. there was no change in cysteine export found in any of the experimental groups (data not
shown).
glucagon treatment increases hepatic enzyme activities involved in methionine catabolism—such a decrease in homocysteine export by hepatocytes coupled with a decreased intracellular homocysteine concentration suggests an appreciably
altered metabolism. therefore, we assayed the major enzymes
involved in producing (transmethylation) and removing (transsulfuration and remethylation) homocysteine in the liver. glucagon-treated rats exhibited increased hepatic activities of enzymes involved in the catabolism of methionine to cysteine
(table iii). the activities of  xxxg928xxx  and
cystathionine ␥-lyase activity were elevated by 25% whereas
cystathionine ␤-synthase activity was increased by 90%. these
changes are still evident when activities are expressed per
gram of liver or per 100 g of body weight (data not shown).
methionine adenosyltransferase activity was unaffected by glucagon treatment. these data suggest the importance of the
hepatic transsulfuration pathway in glucagon’s regulation of
homocysteine metabolism. no changes were observed in  xxxg1479xxx , betaine:homocysteine methyltransferase, or
 xxxg1475xxx  activity.
mrna levels in the glucagon-treated rats—we measured
the mrna levels for cystathionine ␤-synthase and cystathionine ␥-lyase following glucagon treatment by comparing their
abundance to that of ␤-actin. glucagon treatment increased
cystathionine ␤-synthase mrna levels by 90% (fig. 2). this
increase is similar to the increase in enzyme activity. no
change was observed in cystathionine ␥-lyase mrna levels.

of total rna was separated on a 1% agarose gel containing formaldehyde and transferred to a hybond-nylon membrane (amersham pharmacia biotech). cdnas for rat cystathionine ␤-synthase, cystathionine
␥-lyase, and ␤-actin (clontech) were labeled with [␣-32p]dctp using
a random-labeling kit (ambion). the probes (specific activity ⬃109
cpm/␮g) were allowed to hybridize to the membrane for 16 h at 42 °c in
northern max ultrahybridization buffer (ambion). following high
stringency washing (0.1% ssc, 0.1% sds) and radioautography, the
bands were quantitated by densitometry. the cystathionine ␤-synthase
and cystathionine ␥-lyase mrna abundance were normalized to the
amount of rna applied, using ␤-actin mrna.
calculations—intracellular hepatic amino acid concentrations were
calculated using published data from our laboratory on hepatic cellular
spaces (31). the measured hepatic concentration for an amino acid is
the sum of the amino acid in the intracellular fluid (icf) and the amino
acid in the extracellular fluid (ecf). the following equation was used to
determine the hepatic intracellular concentration of an amino acid
(aa).

allosteric regulation of cystathionine ␤-synthase—cystathionine ␤-synthase can also be regulated allosterically by sadenosylmethionine and s- xxxd3157xxx  (33). we
therefore measured the hepatic levels of these modulators.
hepatic concentrations of both  xxxd3156xxx  and sadenosylhomocysteine were elevated following glucagon administration (fig. 3). however, the ratio of sam:sah, often
described as the “methylation ratio,” was unchanged.
increased flux through transsulfuration following glucagon—the second step of the transsulfuration pathway involves
the cleavage of cystathionine to produce cysteine, nh4⫹, and
␣-ketobutyrate. incubating cells with l-[1-14c]methionine will
give rise to ␣-[1-14c]ketobutyrate, which may be metabolized
via pyruvate dehydrogenase to produce 14co2, which may in
turn be readily collected and counted. label in unmetabolized
␣-[1-14c]ketobutyrate can be released with h2o2. such 14co2,
released from ␣-ketobutyrate, must also be included in measures of flux through the transsulfuration pathway (32). following incubation with l-[1-14c]methionine, there was a 5-fold
increase in 14co2 production from hepatocytes isolated from
the glucagon-treated rats as compared with control cells, indicating a profound activation of flux through the transsulfura-

discussion

the regulatory effects of glucagon on amino acid metabolism
have been well documented. it increases the catabolism of a
variety of amino acids (e.g. glycine, glutamine, arginine, and
phenylalanine), it increases gluconeogenesis from amino acids,
and it increases the rate of ureagenesis (10, 34 –38). with this
in mind, an investigation of the specific effects of glucagon on
homocysteine metabolism is warranted. the dose of glucagon
used in this study was indeed pharmacological. we observed a
35-fold increase in plasma glucagon using this dosage, well
above circulating levels in healthy organisms. although these
levels are not observed in a healthy organism, patients with
glucagon-producing tumors have been reported to have a 60fold increase in plasma glucagon (13). therefore, our model is a
good reflection of human glucagonoma. this view is supported
by the similar decreases in total and specific plasma amino
acids in both the glucagon-treated rat and the human glucagonoma patient (13). the decrease in amino acids in glucagonoma patients has been linked to increased clearance from
the plasma, likely by the liver, not due to decreased export from
the muscles (13). given the plethora of effects glucagon has on
amino acid metabolism it is not surprising that glucagon had a
profound effect on circulating homocysteine levels.

actually a product of the transsulfuration pathway, propargylglycine, an irreversible inhibitor of cystathionine ␥-lyase, was
included in the incubations. blocking cystathionine ␥-lyase
resulted in an 80% reduction in 14co2 production from hepatocytes isolated from control and glucagon-treated rats. when
hepatocytes were incubated with cyanocinnimate, an inhibitor
of the mitochondrial ␣-ketoacid transporter, there was a reduction in 14co2 released after the addition of perchloric acid with
a corresponding elevation of 14co2 release after addition of
peroxide. this result further confirms 14co2 production from
[1-14c]methionine as a measure of flux through the transsulfuration pathway and emphasizes the need to determine 14c in
␣-ketobutyrate to fully quantify flux through this pathway.
glucagon activates methionine transport in isolated hepatocytes—our calculations show that the hepatic intracellular
concentration of methionine was elevated in the glucagontreated rats (table ii). of particular interest is the fact that the
ratio of liver to plasma methionine was 5-fold greater in the
glucagon-treated animal. this could be explained by an effect of
glucagon on methionine transport. methionine transport rates
were, therefore, measured from hepatocytes isolated from control and glucagon-treated rats. glucagon treatment resulted in
a doubling of methionine uptake into hepatocytes (fig. 4).

alterations in substrate availability and in the levels of the
effector molecules, sam and sah. this work demonstrates, for
the first time, the effects of the catabolic hormone, glucagon, on
these regulatory parameters and on the expression of the ratelimiting transsulfuration enzyme, cystathionine ␤-synthase.
our in vitro and in vivo experiments show a dramatic effect of
glucagon on the metabolism of the atherogenic amino acid,
homocysteine.
it is clear, from our data, that glucagon administration intervenes at a number of sites (reviewed in fig. 5), in methionine and homocysteine metabolism, and, thus, the observed
changes in homocysteine are a reflection of these different
actions. glucagon affects methionine transport. this is evident
from the fact that the hepatic intracellular concentration of
methionine was increased by 25% and, more impressively, that
the ratio of intracellular to plasma methionine was elevated
5-fold. this suggests a marked stimulation of methionine
transport into liver cells, and, indeed, we found that this was
increased 2-fold in the glucagon-treated rats. this is consistent
with the observation that glucagon up-regulates the system a
amino acid transporter (39), because this is the major hepatic
transporter of methionine. it is likely that the increased hepatic methionine level has important metabolic consequences.
in an elegant theoretical analysis of the control of hepatic
methionine metabolism, martinov et al. (40) showed that this
system is extraordinarily sensitive to small changes in methionine concentration, largely due to the kinetic properties of the
liver-specific  xxxg1378xxx . therefore,
even in the absence of a detectable increase in activity of this
enzyme, it is expected that the increased intracellular methio-

nine concentration will stimulate flux through  xxxd3156xxx  synthase, which can account for the increased hepatic
sam levels.
the markedly decreased plasma methionine concentration,
at a constant dietary intake, implies increased methionine
catabolism, which is consistent with the general plasma amino
acid picture in our rat model, as well as in human glucagonoma
patients. this would involve increased flux through glycine
n-methyltransferase, whose activity is modestly, though significantly, increased. s- xxxd3157xxx , produced in the
 xxxg928xxx  reaction, is also increased in the
livers of these glucagon-treated rats. this may result partially
from the increased flux though  xxxg928xxx 
but must also, in part, reflect its removal though  xxxg104xxx . this is a freely reversible reaction,
thought to operate close to thermodynamic equilibrium in vivo

(41). because sah levels are increased and homocysteine levels are decreased after glucagon treatment, the maintenance of
an equilibrium would require the concentration of adenosine,
the other product of  xxxg104xxx , to be
increased. however, we did not examine this issue.
the increased hepatic sam and sah levels, alone, would
tend to stimulate flux through the transsulfuration pathway,
because both of these nucleotides are allosteric activators of
cystathionine ␤-synthase. they both decrease cystathionine
␤-synthase’s km for homocysteine (33). however, the increased
activities of the two enzymes of the transsulfuration pathway,
especially that of the rate-limiting cystathionine ␤-synthase,
also play a major role. the role of cystathionine ␤-synthase in
regulating plasma homocysteine levels is evident in mice and
humans. watanabe et al. (42) have shown that transgenic mice,
heterozygous for a mutant cystathionine ␤-synthase, have only
half the normal activity of this enzyme and twice the normal
plasma homocysteine level, whereas down’s syndrome patients, who have an extra allele of the cystathionine ␤-synthase
gene, tend to have very low plasma homocysteine concentrations (43). glucagon treatment increased both cystathionine
␤-synthase activity and mrna levels. this is likely to result

from a direct effect on cystathionine ␤-synthase expression.
goss et al. (44) showed that camp, glucagon’s intracellular
messenger, can increase cystathionine ␤-synthase activity in
cultured hepatoma cells. work in our laboratory has shown
that camp increases cystathionine ␤-synthase mrna, protein,
and activity in h4iie cells.3 insulin levels were unchanged in
our glucagon-treated rats so that changes in this hormone
cannot account for the increased activity of cystathionine
␤-synthase, although we have shown that insulin treatment of
diabetic rats can reduce cystathionine ␤-synthase activity to
normal levels (9). it is currently unknown whether glucagon’s
effects on cystathionine ␤-synthase are mediated by an increase in gene transcription, enhancement of mrna stability,
or both. it has been reported that liver cystathionine ␤-synthase mrna is increased in rats fed a high protein diet (45).
because such a diet is known to elevate plasma glucagon (46)
our results provide an explanation for this dietary regulation of
cystathionine ␤-synthase.
that flux through the transsulfuration pathway is stimulated by glucagon treatment is directly shown in isolated hepatocytes (table iv). these data also provide evidence that the
␣-ketobutyrate produced by cystathionine ␥-lyase must enter
mitochondria on the mitochondrial ketoacid transporter for
decarboxylation. a key finding is that glucagon treatment
caused a 4-fold increase in flux through the transsulfuration
pathway even though the increased activity of cystathionine
␤-synthase and cystathionine ␥-lyase was less than 2-fold.
clearly, additional factors must play a role. in this context, the
doubling of the rate of methionine transport into the hepatocyte is key. it is possible that glucagon exerts effects at other
sites, because it activates cellular protein kinases. cystathionine ␤-synthase does contain a  xxxg1836xxx  consensus
sequence, but phosphorylation of this enzyme has yet to be
shown. we can eliminate the idea that flux through the transsulfuration pathway is mediated by changes in serine, the
co-substrate for cystathionine ␤-synthase. indeed, hepatocytes
isolated from the glucagon-treated rats exported less homocysteine, when incubated with methionine, than did control hepatocytes. when serine was included in the incubation, homocysteine export was reduced in control hepatocytes but not in the
hepatocytes isolated from the glucagon-treated rat. however,
the possibility that such a mechanism is important in vivo is
eliminated by the finding that the hepatic concentration of
serine was unaffected by glucagon treatment.
the decreased plasma homocysteine, upon glucagon treatment, follows from the decreased hepatic homocysteine concen-

tration. very little is known about the transport of homocysteine across hepatocyte membranes. in rat cortical tubules
homocystine has been shown to share the y⫹ system transporter with cystine and the dibasic amino acids (47). the uptake of homocystine is plausible, because most of the free
homocysteine in plasma exists in an oxidized disulfide form.
however, uptake of homocystine by liver cells has not been
reported. furthermore, because hepatocytes have such low activity of the y⫹ transporter, another mechanism may be required for homocyst(e)ine uptake (48). given the reduced nature of the intracellular milieu (the cytoplasmic nadph/
nadp⫹ ratio is about 100 (49) and that of  xxxd2213xxx /
 xxxd2811xxx  is about 150 (50)), most of the intracellular
homocysteine is believed to be in the reduced form. this necessitates a transporter that recognizes reduced homocysteine to
effect homocysteine export. at present this carrier has not been
identified. however, glucagon treatment caused no change in
the liver/plasma ratio for total homocysteine. thus it appears
that the concentration of plasma homocysteine followed the
decrease in hepatic homocysteine levels. it is not necessary to
ascribe any role to changes in homocysteine transport.
activated flux through the transsulfuration pathway also
requires increased disposal of cysteine because this substance
does not accumulate (table ii). pyruvate is the carbon product
of cysteine catabolism and is a good gluconeogenic precursor. in
view of glucagon’s well-established role in stimulating gluconeogenesis (36) and given that gluconeogenesis is the likely fate of
much of our dietary amino acids (51), we suggest that glucose
production is the carbon end-product of cysteine oxidation in
these glucagon-treated rats.
this report illustrates the effects of glucagon on sulfur amino
acid metabolism and provides a plausible explanation of how
this catabolic hormone regulates circulating homocysteine concentrations. our previous work (9) emphasized the role of insulin in regulating plasma homocysteine. this anabolic hormone increases plasma homocysteine in the type 1 diabetic

rat. taken together, it is clear that the opposing effects of these
metabolic or “fuel” hormones can be very important in controlling plasma homocysteine metabolism and that the liver is the
site of this hormonal regulation.
