in homocystinuria due to  xxxg350xxx  (cbs) deficiency,  xxxd3049xxx  response has
been linked to distinct mutations and ruled out for others. the splice site mutation c.12242a>c leading to the deletion of exon 12 is predominantly found in patients from central
europe, where it has been found on in average 14% of mutant alleles. in this study we
analyzed the clinical picture in 17 cbs deficient carriers of c.1224-2a>c. homozygotes for
c.1224-2a>c did not respond to  xxxd3049xxx , while in compound heterozygotes the response
to  xxxd3049xxx  depended on the mutation on the second allele. maximum likelihood analysis
revealed one common haplotype of the c.1224-2a>c alleles. additionally, we report the four
novel cbs mutations c.451g>a (p.gly151?), c.740_769del (p.lys247_gly256del), c.862g>c
(p.ala288pro) and c.1135c>t (p.arg379trp). in summary, the data of this study suggest
that the cbs c.1224-2a>c allele confers  xxxd3049xxx  nonresponsiveness and that this mutant
allele came from a common ancestor. © 2004 wiley-liss, inc.

introducton

the classical and most common form of inherited homocystinuria is due to autosomal recessive deficiency of
 xxxg350xxx  (cbs;  xxxg350xxx ; mim# 236200). cbs deficiency leads to an accumulation of

homocysteine in all body tissues and to the formation and renal excretion of homocysteine disulfide, homocystine,
which defines the name of this disease (mudd et al., 1964). the phenotype of cbs deficiency is characterized by
(sub)dislocation of the ocular lenses and skeletal abnormalities, psychomotor retardation, thrombophilia frequently
leading to life-threatening thromboembolic events and premature vascular occlusion (mudd et al., 2001). recently,
several cases have been reported showing that cbs deficiency can lead to isolated venous or arterial thrombosis
with no other symptoms (gaustadnes et al., 2000; linnebank et al., 2003; maclean et al., 2002).
depending on the individual genotype, about one half of patients respond to  xxxd3049xxx  therapy (the active
form of  xxxd3049xxx , pyridoxal 5’-phosphate, is the cofactor of cbs) (kraus et al., 1999; mudd et al., 2001). up to
now (june 2004), 131 disease causing mutations on 551 patient alleles have been published (e.g., kraus et al.,
1999; for mutation update and allele frequencies see cbs mutation database). the most prevalent disease causing
mutation is the c.833t>c transition (p.ile278thr; 140 alleles in total), which has been found on up to one half of
affected alleles depending on the respective population. surprisingly, frequency of heterozygosity for this mutation
in the general population is much higher, i.e. around 1.5% in the danish and german and 0,2% in the czech
population (gaustadnes et al., 1999; linnebank et al., 2001a, sokolova et al., 2001). in the irish population, the
mutation c.919g>a (p.gly307ser) is the most frequent one. it supposedly spread by a founder effect (found on 87
alleles in total; kim et al., 1997). the splicing mutation c.1224-2a>c (p.trp409_gly453del) in intron 11 is the
fourth most common mutation deposited in the cbs database (19 alleles, mostly of european origin). it leads to
the deletion of exon 12 and is not associated with mrna instability, but with a functionally inactive enzyme
(kozich and kraus, 1992). however, detailed clinical analyses in larger groups of patients carrying this mutation
have not been conducted, and the severity and b6 responsiveness of the mutant allele has not yet been firmly
established. furthermore, no molecular data are available on the origin of the mutant allele.
in this study we analyzed the clinical picture and the  xxxd3049xxx  responsiveness in a cohort of 17
homocystinuric patients of european origin, who are homozygotes or compound heterozygotes for c.1224-2a>c.
furthermore, we explored whether the high frequency of the mutant allele in europe may have arisen from a
common founder ancestor by determining haplotypes of 19 c.1224-2a>c chromosomes.
subjects and methods

17 cbs deficient patients of caucasian origin carrying the mutation c.1224-2a>c were included in this study.
they were known from the cbs database, from personal communication or from our own hospitals and
laboratories. except for one patient of turkish origin, all these patients were of "central" europe ancestry: 4
polish, 4 slovak, 3 czech, 2 german, 1 austrian, 1 croatian, 1 hungarian. some data on a pert of these patients
(cz and sk) have already been published under the same ids as shown in this paper (janosik et al., 2001b;
orendac et al., 2004). the clinical course with special regard to  xxxd3049xxx  response was evaluated. in the healthy
population, the upper limit of the normal range of fasting total plasma homocysteine is around 15µmol/l, whereas
cbs deficient patients often present with elevations up to 500µmol/l (mudd et al., 2001). in the present study,
response to  xxxd3049xxx  supplementation – usually 500mg to 1000mg per day – was defined as a decrease of fasting
total plasma homocysteine to 50µmol/l or lower, partial response as a decrease to 50-200µmol/l.
the nucleotide numbering in this article refers to the cbs gene accession af042836.1, whereby the a of the
atg start codon (p.1) was set as nucleotide g.1 and c.1 according to den dunnen and antonarakis (2000).
the protocol for genomic dna-based mutation detection by polymerase chain reaction (pcr) and direct
sequencing of all coding exons and flanking intronic regions employed established methods (gaustadnes et al.,
1998; janosik et al., 2001b; kozich and kraus, 1992; linnebank et al., 2001b). polymorphic markers were
analyzed in genomic dna using previously published conditions for g.6955c>t, g.11686c>t (kraus et al.,
1993), g.18854c>t (avramopoulos et al., 1993), g.9132_g.9133ins68 (linnebank et al., 2001a), the cbs ivs12polymorphisms (g.13514a>g, g.13617a>g, g.13715c>t, g.13800a>g, 13904c>t; linnebank et al., 2001b),
and the vntr g.14048 (kraus et al., 1998). in patients with thrombophilic events, presence of  xxxg749xxx 
(omim 227400) and polymorphic hyperprothrombinemia (mim# 176930) were investigated as published
(martinelli et al., 1998). in addition, 100 control chromosomes were analyzed for the presence of the novel
mutations reported in this study. mutations were confirmed on a second pcr product and, when possible, on the
transcriptional level and parental dna.
haplotypes were constructed from genotypes using the maximum likelihood method (software hapmax,
developed by m. krawczak, http://www.uni-kiel.de/medinfo/mitarbeiter/krawczak/download/).

all patients or their parents gave written informed consent for molecular genetic analyses. the genetic
investigation was approved by the local ethics committee.
results

the 17 cbs deficient patients carrying the mutation c.1224-2a>c were clinically and genetically
characterized. two patients ( xxxd2951xxx  and ger-26) were homozygous for c.1224-2a>c, which could be proven by
analysis of parental dna in one case. the other patients were compound heterozygous with different mutations on
the second allele (table 1). on 1 of the 34 alleles, no mutation was found (patient sk-12; table 1).

4 linnebank et al.

four mutations found in the 17 patients were novel: c.451g>a (p.gly151?; splice donor site defect of
undetermined consequences: cells for rt-pcr analysis were not available for the affected patient ger-13),
c.740_769del (p.lys247_gly256del; patient ger-16), c.862g>c (p.ala288pro; patient ger-37) and c.1135c>t
(p.arg379trp; patient ger-34). these mutations were found on a single allele each, but not on 100 control
chromosomes. they affect amino acid residues conserved in homo sapiens, rattus norvegicus, dicdi (amoebae),
and saccharomyces cerevisae derived from a blast analysis (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast/; not shown).
the clinical spectrum varied from rather mild phenotypes with isolated thrombotic events or ocular lens
dislocation to severe phenotypes with disabling mental retardation and generalized involvement of connective
tissue. at the time of diagnosis, the two patients homozygous for c.1224-2a>c presented with severe phenotypes
( xxxd2951xxx  and ger-26; tab. 1; requests for detailed clinical and personal data on the patients are welcome). they
exhibited  xxxd3049xxx  nonresponsiveness, while  xxxd3049xxx  response of the other patients depended on the
mutation of the second allele. those with apparently severe mutations did not respond to  xxxd3049xxx : ger-13
(splice defect), cz-04 and sk-09 (frameshift mutations) and sk-06 (nonsense mutation). contrarily, several
patients who responded to  xxxd3049xxx  had less severe mutations on the second allele, suggesting that the overall
response maybe determined by the nature of the second allele. thus, b6 responsiveness in compound heterozygotes
probably indicates whether the other mutation is mild or severe, whereas c.1224-2a>c itself was associated with
("recessive")  xxxd3049xxx -non-responsiveness. the three patients who carried the novel mutations c.451g>a,
c.740_769del and c.862g>c, respectively, in compound heterozygous state together with c.1224-2a>c presented
with  xxxd3049xxx  nonresponsiveness in vivo. thus, these novel mutations are likely to be  xxxd3049xxx  nonresponsive.
in contrast, the novel mutation c.1135c>t seems to confer b6-responsiveness.
none of the patients with thrombotic events carried the  xxxg749xxx  or the prothrombin polymorphism
confirming that those are not necessary for thrombotic events in cbs deficiency (kluijtmans et al., 1998). in the
17 patients we analyzed 10 polymorphisms in the cbs gene and constructed haplotypes by maximum likelihood
approach. all 19 c.1224-2a>c chromosomes shared the same haplotype (table 2). these data indicate that
c.1224-2a>c originated from a single mutational event, and a founder effect may be responsible for the origin of
the mutation in europe. tab. 3 summarizes the data on cbs mutations and haplotypes of this study.

discussion

cbs deficiency is the most common inborn error of methionine metabolism (gaustadnes et al., 1999; janosik et
al., 2001b; linnebank et al., 2003). as the genotype of cbs deficiency is correlated to the clinical phenotype, in
particular to  xxxd3049xxx -responsiveness (kraus et al., 1999), a detailed work-up of the genetic background of cbs
deficiency seems to be a reasonable approach. this study focused on the disease causing cbs mutation c.12242a>c, which is rather frequent in cbs deficient patients in europe (janosik et al., 2001b; cbs mutation
database). we found that c.1224-2a>c is associated with  xxxd3049xxx  nonresponsiveness in vivo and most probably
spread from a founder-effect.
c.1224-2a>c was initially described in a male patient of ashkenazi jewish origin, who was mildly affected
presenting only with dislocation of both ocular lenses, whereby psychomotor development was normal (kozich
and kraus, 1992). he was compound heterozygous for c.1224-2a>c together with c.833t>c on the other allele,
whilst the second allele was thought to be responsible for the mild phenotype and the  xxxd3049xxx  response
observed in that patient. later, seven compound heterozygous patients of czech and slovak origin were
ascertained (janosik et al., 2001b), who were re-evaluated as part of the present study. in spite of the high number
of genetically analyzed alleles in all cases of cbs deficiency (currently n=551; cbs mutation database ), the
c.1224-2a>c mutation has rarely been observed out of "central" europe, so far: one patient of the present study
was from turkey, and one of ashkenazi jewish origin was described as mentioned above. therefore, this mutation
seems to be frequent in europe, but probably not out of this area, which is important for strategies in genetic
screening and diagnosis.
the majority of exon 12 is part of the so-called cbs domain, which might be essential for enzyme regulation
and binding of  xxxd3156xxx , a cbs activator (bateman, 1997; janosik et al., 2001a; scott et al., 2004). in
e.coli expression experiments, peptides from transcripts missing exon 12 showed a complete and  xxxd3049xxx  non-

responsive lack of enzyme activity in comparison to expressed wild type peptides suggesting a severe  xxxd3049xxx 
nonresponsive enzyme deficiency due to c.1224-2a>c in vitro (kozich and kraus, 1992). accordingly, the data of
the present study suggest a correlation of c.1224-2a>c with a severe  xxxd3049xxx  nonresponsive phenotype in vivo:
the two cbs deficient patients homozygous for c.1224-2a>c presented with a severe phenotype and did not
respond to supplementation of  xxxd3049xxx . in the compound heterozygous patients, the phenotype and the vitamin
b6 response seemed to depend on the second allele.
the data of the present study supplement the information on genotype-phenotype-correlation in cbs
deficiency, which can be helpful in the prediction of the clinical outcome and the therapeutic and predictive
options in genetically analyzed patients. de-novo diagnosed patients should be tested for  xxxd3049xxx 
responsiveness without waiting for genetic data, but a quick detection of  xxxd3049xxx  non-responders, e.g., by
standardized molecular genetic analysis, can be helpful to recognize those patients, who must be treated with
alternative strategies (mudd et al., 2001).
the analyses of polymorphic markers revealed that c.1224-2a>c is associated with a certain cbs haplotype.
therefore, the affected alleles reported in this study seem to stem from a common ancestor allele of that haplotype.
the haplotype system introduced in this study may be helpful for future investigations of the genetic background
of cbs deficiency or for clinical purposes like haplotyping of affected families, e.g. for pre- or perinatal diagnosis.
concerning the four novel private mutations, we classify them as most likely disease causing, because they
affect conserved amino acid residues, they were not found on other chromosomes of this or prior studies, and no
further mutations were found in the respective patients (except for c.1224-2a>c on the other allele). these
mutations further exemplify the genetic and phenotypic heterogeneity in cbs deficiency.
in conclusion, this study reports that the cbs splice site-mutation c.1224-2a>c is associated with  xxxd3049xxx 
nonresponsiveness and that this mutation most probably came from a common founder ancestor allele as analyzed
by a novel haplotype system. additionally, we introduce four novel cbs mutations and report genotypephenotype-correlations. the information of this study might e.g. help in the understanding of the genetic
background of cbs deficiency, in the design of screening strategies and in the prediction of the clinical course and
the therapeutic response in cbs deficient patients.
