summary: the in vitro effects of  xxxd2785xxx , a dual vasopeptidase inhibitor
that simultaneously inhibits  xxxg1417xxx  (nep) and angiotensinconverting enzyme (ace), on exogenous bradykinin metabolism after a
single passage through the coronary bed were compared with that of a nep
inhibitor (retrothiorphan, 25 nm), an ace inhibitor (enalaprilat, 130 nm), and
 xxxd2785xxx  (25 nm). bradykinin and inhibitors were infused into isolated
langendorff rat hearts perfused at 1 ml/min followed by reperfusion  xxxd1891xxx 
ml/min. residual bradykinin was quantified in the coronary effluent by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay to calculate bradykinin recovery and its
kinetic parameters (vmax/km). bradykinin degradation rate at 1 ml/min was
4.56 ± 0.39 1/min per gram without inhibitors and was significantly reduced
to 2.57 ± 0.19 1/min per gram in the presence of enalaprilat, to 2.97 ± 0.38
1/min per gram with retrothiorphan, to 1.82 ± 0.17 1/min per gram with both
enalaprilat and retrothiorphan, and to 1.14 ± 0.35 1/min per gram with
 xxxd2785xxx . in a second set of experiments, the effect of a 14-day treatment
of rats with either ace inhibitors (enalapril,  xxxd3063xxx , and ramipril), a nep
inhibitor ( xxxd419xxx ), or  xxxd2785xxx  on exogenous bradykinin metabolism
was studied in langendorff perfused hearts isolated from these long-term
treated rats. in untreated rats, bradykinin degradation at a coronary perfusion
of 1 ml/min was 4.35 ± 0.41 1/min per gram. this value was reduced by 30%
for the nep inhibitor, by 50% for all ace inhibitors, and by 75% for  xxxd2785xxx . all inhibitors administered either short term or long term significantly
reduced bradykinin degradation during a single passage through the coronary
bed. however,  xxxd2785xxx  administration resulted in the greatest protection
from bradykinin breakdown than ace or nep inhibitors alone. key words:
bradykinin—metabolism—ace inhibitors—nep inhibitors—heart—

the nonapeptide bradykinin, generated from plasma
precursors, kininogens, by specific and nonspecific kininogenases, has important vasoactive and antiproliferative effects. once formed, it is rapidly metabolized.  xxxg36xxx  (ace) represents an
important metabolic pathway for bradykinin in rat and
human serum (1), in the rat coronary bed (2), and in
cardiac membranes of different animal species (3). however, ace (also known as  xxxg36xxx ) is not the sole
enzyme responsible for the metabolic breakdown of bradykinin because other enzymes such as  xxxg1417xxx  (nep,  xxxg1417xxx ) and kininase i are also involved. kininase i, a generic name for different plasma
and membrane carboxypeptidases responsible for the
metabolism of bradykinin into its active metabolite, desarg9-bradykinin (4), is normally only a minor metabolic
pathway for bradykinin in serum (1) and cardiac membranes (3). we have previously reported that nep plays
a critical role in the degradation of bradykinin by the
coronary endothelium when ace activity is impaired
(2). in addition, the short-term administration of a combined treatment with the ace inhibitor enalaprilat and
the nep inhibitor retrothiorphan reduced bradykinin
degradation to a value that was lower than that seen with
either inhibitor alone (2). moreover, it has been demonstrated that  xxxd2785xxx , a vasopeptidase inhibitor that
simultaneously inhibits nep and ace, was significantly
more effective than the ace inhibitor, enalaprilat, on
bradykinin degradation by cardiac membranes prepared
from healthy and postinfarction rat hearts (5). to determine whether the vasopeptidase inhibitor  xxxd2785xxx 
was more effective than nep and ace inhibition, the
present investigation was performed to examine the
short-term effect of  xxxd2785xxx  on exogenous bradykinin
metabolism in langendorff rat hearts after a single passage through the coronary bed, in comparison with nep
inhibition by retrothiorphan, ace inhibition by enalaprilat, and their combination. in addition, to verify that the
superior effect of  xxxd2785xxx  remains after long-term
treatment, bradykinin metabolism in hearts isolated from
rats treated for 14 days with either a nep inhibitor, ace
inhibitors, or  xxxd2785xxx , was evaluated.
methods
drugs and peptides
bradykinin was obtained from peninsula laboratories
(belmont, ca, u.s.a.). enalaprilat and enalapril,
 xxxd3063xxx , ramipril, and  xxxd419xxx  were kindly provided
from their respective manufacturers.  xxxd2785xxx  was obtained from bristol-myers squibb (princeton, nj,
u.s.a.). retrothiorphan was a generous gift from dr.
j cardiovasc pharmacol™, vol. 37, no. 4, 2001

bernard p. roques (laboratory of molecular and structural pharmacochemistry, université rené descartes,
paris, france). all these inhibitors were dissolved in a
0.9% nacl solution. for  xxxd2785xxx  and  xxxd419xxx ,
solubilization was obtained by increasing the ph value to
8 with 1 n naoh, and bringing the ph back slowly
toward physiologic values with 1 n hcl. sodium pentobarbital (somnotol) was purchased from mtc pharmaceuticals (mississauga, ontario, canada).
animals and methods
short-term experiments. experiments were conducted
according to the guidelines from the canadian council
on animal care using male sprague–dawley rats weighing between 200 and 225 g. rats were narcotized with
co2 until complete loss of consciousness and promptly
decapitated. the thorax was rapidly opened and hearts
were excised and immersed in ice-cold buffer containing
heparin (20 ui/ml) before being perfused at constant
flow through the aorta according to the langendorff
model. the perfusion solution was a modified krebs–
henseleit buffer continuously gassed with o2 and co2
(95:5) at a temperature of 37°c, ph 7.4, containing (mm)
nacl, 118; kcl, 4; cacl2, 2.5; kh2po4, 1.2;  xxxd2534xxx , 1;
nahco3, 24; d-glucose, 5; and pyruvate, 2. hearts
were allowed to stabilize for 20 min  xxxd1891xxx  ml/min. the
experiments were performed with hearts perfused at
1 ml/min (low-flow ischemia) for 28 min and the coronary flow rate was returned to 10 ml/min (reperfusion)
for the last 10 min. five minutes after the reduction in
flow, exogenous bradykinin was infused with syringe
pumps (model 355, sage instruments, cambridge, ma,
u.s.a.) into the aortic flow line at 1/100th of the coronary flow rate throughout the experiment, to obtain a
final concentration in the heart of 10 nm. in treated
hearts (short-term treatment) enzyme inhibitors were coinfused with bradykinin, for a final concentration of
25 nm for retrothiorphan, 130 nm for enalaprilat, and
25 nm for  xxxd2785xxx . effluent fractions of 2 ml were
collected at the end of the stabilization period, at 1 and
26 min after the reduction in flow, and 10 min after the
reperfusion, into tubes containing ice-cold trifluoroacetic
acid (100 ␮l of a 10% solution per milliliter of perfusate)
under constant agitation. hearts were kept immersed in
the buffer solution at 37°c throughout the reduced flow
to ensure a constant temperature. coronary perfusion
pressure (cpp) was measured with a pressure transducer
connected to a sidearm of the aortic flow line. isovolumetric developed left ventricular pressure (dlvp) was
measured with a fluid-filled latex balloon inserted into
the left ventricle and connected to a second pressure
transducer. heart rate (hr) was derived from the dlvp.

bradykinin metabolism in the coronary bed
these variables were recorded on a nihon-kohden (tokyo, japan) polygraph system.
long-term pretreatment. enalapril,  xxxd3063xxx , and
ramipril (ace inhibitors),  xxxd419xxx  (nep inhibitor),
and  xxxd2785xxx  were administered for 14 days (5.0 ␮l/h)
at a dose of 20 mg/kg per day for  xxxd419xxx  and 1
mg/kg per day for all the other inhibitors using miniosmotic pumps (model 2ml2, alzet, cupertino, ca,
u.s.a.). rats were anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital, 65 mg/kg, injected intraperitoneally, and the osmotic pumps were implanted subcutaneously through a
small incision performed in the skin between the scapulae. at the 14th day, hearts were extracted and perfused
on the langendorff model as described above. the same
experimental protocol was applied, but without perfusing
the enzyme inhibitors.
purification and quantification of bradykinin and
des-arg9-bradykinin from perfusate
the perfusate was purified by chromatography on c8silica column (waters, milford, ma, u.s.a.) as described earlier (6). the eluate containing kinins was
evaporated to dryness in a speed vac system (savant,
farmingdale, nj, u.s.a.). the residue was dissolved in
500 ␮l of a tris-hcl buffer (50 mm) containing tween
20 (0.5 ml/l) and nacl (100 mm). residual immunoreactive bradykinin was quantified by a competitive enzyme immunoassay as previously described (6,7). this
assay used highly specific polyclonal rabbit immunoglobulins raised against the carboxy-terminal end of bradykinin, digoxigenin-labeled peptide as tracer, and alkaline phosphatase-labeled iggs anti-digoxigenin fab
fragments with the substrate  xxxd2822xxx  to
detect and quantify the immune complexes. typical calibration curves were characterized by half-maximal saturation values of 0.78 pmol/ml.
statistical analysis
all results were expressed as mean ± sem. bradykinin samples were assayed in triplicate. the bradykinin
degradation rate (vmax/km , per minute) was calculated
with the michaelis–menton equations as follows (8,9):
100
vmax 1
,
= ln
km
t %recovery
where t is the transit time and % recovery is the percent
of bradykinin recovered after a single passage through
the coronary bed. vmax/km was corrected for the heart
mass (per minute per gram). the transit time was calculated by the following equation:

t=

361
vdbk
,
flow

where vdbk and flow refer to the volume of distribution
of bradykinin and coronary flow rate, respectively. the
volume of distribution of bradykinin used in the present
study was measured previously with tritiated bradykinin
at 1 and 10 ml/min and was equal to 0.426 ± 0.019 and
0.316 ± 0.026 ml/g, respectively (2). the statistical significance was evaluated using anova (systat for windows, version 9, spss, inc., chicago, il, u.s.a.). a p <
0.05 was considered statistically significant.
results
the concentration of endogenous bradykinin in the
perfusate in time-matched control experiments without
infusion of bradykinin, either in the absence or presence
of enzyme inhibitors, corresponded approximately to
1%–3% of the exogenous bradykinin infused (data
not shown). reducing coronary flow rate from 10 to
1 ml/min was accompanied by changes in hr (from 278
± 9 to 137 ± 13 beats/min, p < 0.05), cpp (from 52 ± 1
to 12 ± 1 mm hg, p < 0.05), and dlvp (from 89 ± 3 to
17 ± 2 mm hg, p < 0.05), and returned to 255 ± 8
beats/min, 51 ± 1 mm hg, and 85 ± 3 mm hg, respectively, after 10 min of reperfusion (10 ml/min). the effect of flow modification on hr, cpp, and dlvp in
treated hearts was comparable with that in untreated
hearts (data not shown).
short-term treatment
bradykinin degradation rate, at a coronary flow of 1
ml/min and measured after 20 min of bradykinin infusion
without inhibitors, was 4.56 ± 0.39 1/min per gram. this
degradation rate was significantly reduced to 2.57 ± 0.19
1/min per gram in the presence of enalaprilat, to 2.97 ±
0.38 1/min per gram with retrothiorphan, to 1.82 ± 0.17
1/min per gram with the combination of enalaprilat and
retrothiorphan, and to 1.14 ± 0.35 1/min per gram with
 xxxd2785xxx . these data were analyzed with a one-way
anova followed by orthogonal contrasts. enalaprilat
and retrothiorphan reduced bradykinin degradation rate
to a similar extent (fig. 1).  xxxd2785xxx  and the combination of enalaprilat plus retrothiorphan were comparable and were more effective than enalaprilat alone and
retrothiorphan alone in preventing bradykinin breakdown (fig. 1). at the end of the experiments, when the
flow rate was returned to 10 ml/min, bradykinin catabolism was also significantly reduced by all treatments
(table 1).

long-term treatment
bradykinin degradation rate at 1 ml/min (fig. 2) in
untreated control hearts was 4.35 ± 0.41 1/min per gram
and was significantly reduced to 2.10 ± 0.22 1/min per

0.14 1/min per gram with  xxxd3063xxx , to 1.98 ± 0.12 1/min
per gram with ramipril, and to 2.98 ± 0.02 1/min per
gram with  xxxd419xxx .  xxxd2785xxx  was more effective in
diminishing bradykinin degradation rate (1.05 ± 0.08
1/min per gram) than all other inhibitors, with the exception of  xxxd3063xxx , for which the difference did not
reach the statistical level of significance. at a flow rate
of 10 ml/min, bradykinin recovery was significantly increased with all inhibitors (table 1).
to evaluate the additivity of ace and nep inhibitors,
a two-way factorial anova was performed to test the
interaction between ace and nep inhibition on bradykinin degradation rate in short-term and long-term protocols. all hearts were regrouped according to the presj cardiovasc pharmacol™, vol. 37, no. 4, 2001

effect on bradykinin breakdown, whether the other enzyme is inhibited or not (fig. 3).

discussion
in the present study we demonstrated that  xxxd2785xxx ,
a new class of cardiovascular drugs that act by combined
inhibition of nep and ace, was more effective than
single ace or nep inhibitors in reducing bradykinin
metabolism after a single passage through the coronary
bed of isolated rat hearts. to compare these inhibitors,
concentrations producing complete enzyme inhibition
were used. enalaprilat and retrothiorphan are potent and
highly selective inhibitors, with ki values of 1.2 and 2.3
nm, respectively (10). in the present study, we used 130
nm enalaprilat and 25 nm retrothiorphan, which amounts

are more than 100 and 10 times their respective ki values. furthermore, we performed a dose-response pilot
study with  xxxd2785xxx  (from 25 to 510 nm) and found
maximal protection against bradykinin breakdown already at 25 nm (m.-j. dumoulin, a. adam, d. lamontagne, 1999, unpublished observation).  xxxd2785xxx  was
also more effective than ace and nep inhibitors in
preventing bradykinin degradation after a 2-week longterm treatment. although ace inhibitors differ slightly
with regard to their potency, the dose ranges used in
patients are wide and overlapping. therefore, the same
dose was used for  xxxd2785xxx  and all ace inhibitors. a
higher dose of  xxxd419xxx , proven effective in rats (11),
was used. however, we cannot warrant complete enzyme
inhibition with this drug regimen in vivo. in addition, the
possibility that differences in some pharmacokinetic parameters of these drugs, such as distribution and clearance, may contribute to the differences observed in the
long-term–treated groups cannot be completely ruled
out. however, the fact that the data observed with the

long-term treatment (bottom). figure is adapted from figures 1 and 2, with hearts regrouped according to the presence of acei, nepi,
both inhibitions (acei + nepi), or no inhibition (untreated).

long-term treatments are in agreement with the data obtained when the drugs were directly perfused into the
hearts strongly argues against this possibility.
the bradykinin degradation rate is a better measurement of bradykinin catabolism than the simple percentage of bradykinin recovery, taking into account the
j cardiovasc pharmacol™, vol. 37, no. 4, 2001

transit time through the coronary vascular bed. hence,
the degradation rate was used in the present study for
the data obtained at a coronary flow of 1 ml/min. however, it could not be applied to the data obtained at
10 ml/min for the following reason: as bradykinin recovery approaches 100%, as in the case of  xxxd2785xxx  at

bradykinin metabolism in the coronary bed
10 ml/min, minute changes in bradykinin recovery yield
huge changes in bradykinin degradation rate. therefore,
under these conditions, bradykinin degradation rate becomes highly sensitive to the small fluctuations in the
analysis technique, making it an unreliable variable.
 xxxg36xxx  is mainly endothelial
and is responsible for conversion of  xxxg99xxx  into
 xxxg99xxx  and degradation of kinins within the vascular compartment. nep is involved in the in vitro catabolism of several peptides including atrial natriuretic
peptide (anp), bradykinin, endothelin, and  xxxg99xxx 
and ii (12–14), and appears to participate in these processes in vivo as well (15). both ace and nep inhibitors reduced bradykinin degradation rate, suggesting an
important contribution of not only ace, but also nep in
the catabolism of bradykinin by the coronary vascular
bed. in a previous study, we reported that inhibition of
nep had no effect on bradykinin degradation rate (2).
however, under the present experimental conditions,
hearts were kept immersed in the buffer solution at 37°c
throughout the reduced flow period to ensure a constant
temperature, which was not possible in our former study
with continuous effluent sampling. therefore, it is possible that a difference in temperature could explain the
contrasting results with the nep inhibitor in our former
study and the present one. moreover, the overall bradykinin rate of degradation was higher under the present
conditions than in our former study, a finding that is
compatible with the enzymes’ being more effective at a
physiologic temperature. we also observed that bradykinin catabolism was higher at low coronary flow rate,
which is probably explained by an increased transit time
and exposure to the enzymes. interestingly, this implies
that the enzyme inhibitors will have a more profound
effect on bradykinin degradation in situations of impaired coronary flow, like ischemic heart diseases.
in the present study,  xxxd2785xxx  was more effective
than the nep inhibitor and the ace inhibitor in preventing bradykinin degradation, which should be expected
from this dual inhibitor. such an additive effect of ace
and nep inhibition in preventing bradykinin breakdown
has also been reported in cultured endothelial cells (16).
after a 2-week long-term treatment,  xxxd2785xxx  was still
the most effective in preventing bradykinin degradation,
compared with three ace inhibitors and a nep inhibitor.
besides the comparison of  xxxd2785xxx  with these agents,
this result indicates that the dual inhibition of ace and
nep by  xxxd2785xxx  is not accompanied, at least within 2
weeks, by compensatory mechanisms that could offset its
effect on bradykinin catabolism.
co-inhibition of ace and nep could be of great
therapeutic interest in cardiovascular diseases, because it

365

combines a renal effect due to nep inhibition with a
vasodilating effect resulting from ace inhibition (17).
this could result in additive or synergistic responses because  xxxg99xxx  and anp have opposite effects on
blood pressure and renal sodium handling (18). there is
mounting evidence that at least part of the protective
effect of ace and nep inhibitors is the result of the
inhibition of bradykinin metabolism, which in turn increases  xxxd2738xxx  hyperpolarizing factor, and prostaglandin levels. for example,
antagonists of kinin receptors can block the cardioprotective effect of both ace (19) and nep inhibitors (20).
furthermore, the present study clearly demonstrates that
the dual inhibitor of nep and ace,  xxxd2785xxx , is more
efficient in reducing the catabolism of bradykinin than
the single inhibitors, which could lead to enhanced bradykinin accumulation and, in turn, cardioprotective effects. the antihypertensive effect of ace inhibitors in
conscious spontaneously hypertensive rats was enhanced
by co-administration of selective inhibitors of nep (21).
it has been shown that  xxxd2785xxx  has a long duration of
antihypertensive activity in low-, normal-, and high- renin models of hypertension (22). in dogs with pacinginduced heart failure, nep inhibitors potentiated the vasodilatory effects of ace inhibitors (23). in a similar
model, long-term treatment with ace inhibitors potentiated the renal hemodynamic and excretory responses to
nep inhibitors (24). however, in a coronary artery occlusion model, nep inhibitors did not potentiate the cardioprotective effects of ace inhibitors, although they
significantly reduced infarct size similarly to ace inhibitors (20). recently trippodo et al. (25) showed that,
in cardiomyopathic hamsters, inhibition of nep and
ace with  xxxd2785xxx  caused a significant decrease in
left ventricular pressure and total peripheral resistance
and an increase in cardiac output compared with an ace
or nep inhibitor alone. overall, numerous studies have
shown that dual inhibition of nep and ace in different
models of hypertension and heart failure results in cardiovascular effects greater than those caused by either
inhibition alone.
in conclusion, all inhibitors resulted in significant reduction in bradykinin degradation. importantly, this
study demonstrated that the short term or long term administration of the vasopeptidase inhibitor,  xxxd2785xxx ,
resulted in the greatest protection from bradykinin breakdown than single nep or ace inhibition.
