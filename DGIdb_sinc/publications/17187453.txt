dofetilide is a relatively new class iii antiarrhythmic agent that selectively blocks the rapid
component of the cardiac ion channel delayed rectifier current. this results in an increase
in the action potential duration and effective refractory period of the myocyte, thereby
terminating reentrant tachyarrhythmias and preventing their re-induction. oral dofetilide is
effective in the conversion of atrial fibrillation and flutter to sinus rhythm and in the
maintenance of sinus rhythm after conversion. it is generally well tolerated but like other
antiarrhythmic agents in its class, torsades de pointes may be induced as a consequence
of therapy. this risk is minimized by dosage adjustment according to creatinine clearance
and qtc interval, by selecting patients without known risk factors for torsades and by
initiating treatment in a monitored hospital setting for the first 3 days. unlike other
antiarrhythmic agents, oral dofetilide did not increase mortality in patients with a recent
myocardial infarction or congestive heart failure, hence its importance as an alternative
medication for the pharmacological conversion of atrial fibrillation and flutter, and
maintenance of sinus rhythm after conversion in patients at high risk of sudden death.
expert rev. cardiovasc. ther. 5(1), 9–19 (2007)

pharmacologic therapy for the conversion and
prevention of atrial fibrillation (af) in high
risk patients has been associated with rather
disappointing efficacy, tolerability and safety,
including an increase risk of death [1]. the long
term use of class ic agents:  xxxd2113xxx ,  xxxd1991xxx  and  xxxd2669xxx  in the cast studies [2,3]
and the class iii agent d-sotalol in the
sword study [4] was associated with an
increased risk of mortality compared with placebo when used in high risk patients post myocardial infarction (mi) with left-ventricular
dysfunction. quinidine therapy was also associated with about threefold increase in mortality
when used for maintenance of sinus rhythm
after cardioversion of af [5]. in addition, their
side effect profile has further restricted their use
in specific patient populations [6]. to date, amiodarone is the most extensively studied agent
that has a proven safety profile in patients with
structural heart disease and was not associated
with increased mortality when compared with
placebo in the treatment of various arrhythmias
[7]. amiodarone maintains sinus rhythm in
nearly two-thirds of patients after cardioversion

with up to 1 year follow-up, but has a 41% discontinuation rate mostly related to its side
effects involving the lung, liver and thyroid,
some of which might be life threatening such as
pulmonary toxicity.
dofetilide ( xxxd1923xxx ™) is a relatively recent
oral class iii antiarrhythmic drug that has been
approved by the us fda for the conversion of
af and flutter and maintenance of normal
sinus rhythm. it has been evaluated in patients
with heart failure and post-mi. this article
reviews the pharmacology, safety, efficacy and
clinical use of dofetilide.
introduction to the compound

dofetilide is a vaughan williams class iii
antiarrhythmic agent. it is a  xxxg1232xxx 
blocker that selectively inhibits the rapid
component of the delayed rectifier potassium
current (ikr) [8].

chemical name is n-[4-[2-[methyl[2-[4-[(methylsulfonyl)amino]phenoxy]ethyl]amino]ethyl]phenyl]-methanesulfonamide (figure 1).
pharmacodynamics

dofetilide is a selective blocker of ikr, the major repolarizing
current, resulting in delayed myocardial repolarization and
increased myocardial refractoriness. at the recommended
doses, it does not have any effect on the slow component of
the delayed rectifier potassium current (iks) or the inward
current ( xxxg1160xxx   xxxg1267xxx ), nor does it possess any sodium channel (ina),
calcium channel (ica) or beta-receptor blocking effects [8].
therefore, it has a selective effect of prolonging the action
potential and the refractory period in myocardial tissue. this
constitutes the basis of its antiarrhythmic action; by prolonging refractoriness, a reentrant arrhythmic wavefront has
a higher chance of encountering refractory tissue and would
therefore be suppressed or terminated (figure 2). dofetilide
has no effect on the resting membrane potential, maximum
upstroke velocity of the action potential (vmax) and does not
alter conduction parameters, resulting in a selective prolongation of the qt interval on the ekg without any effect
on pr, qrs, ah or hv intervals [10].
dofetilide prolongs the refractory period in the atria to a
greater extent than in the ventricle. dose for dose, the

increase in atrial effective refractory
period is double that of ventricular
effective refractory period [11]. this may
h
account for its greater effectiveness in
n

treating atrial arrhythmias. it also has
s
more effect on purkinje fibers from
o
o
female dogs compared with fibers from
male dogs, which is consistent with the
increased risk of torsades de pointes in
women [12].
dofetilide does not significantly affect
the cycle length or recovery time of the
sinus node (table 1). it prolongs repolarization linearly in a concentration related
fashion. it does not increase dispersion of ventricular repolarization [13]. the effects of dofetilide do not seem to be
attenuated by metabolic acidosis [14] or hypoxia [15], which
are two major manifestations of myocardial ischemia. dofetilide prolongs the effective refractory period in a reverse frequency-dependent manner at different potassium concentrations but hyperkalemia and hypokalemia seem to decrease
this effect in rabbit myocardium [16]. it also exerts
antiarrythmic effects during both simulated ischemia and
reperfusion [17], but these effects did not seem to be
explained by its pure class iii action [18].
hemodynamic effects

both animal and human studies have shown that dofetilide
does not depress left-ventricular contractility [19,20]. unlike
other nonspecific class iii agents, such as amiodarone or sotalol, when dofetilide was given intravenously to patients with
congestive heart failure (chf) and compromised ventricular
function (nyha class ii and iii, and left-ventricular ejection
fraction [lvef]<35%), mean cardiac output was maintained
despite a small reduction in mean heart rate [20]. moreover,
some data suggest a positive atrial inotropic effect as shown
echocardiographically after administration of oral dofetilide
500 µg twice daily in patients with af [21].

dofetilide is almost completely absorbed after oral administration with a bioavailability of more than 90% and wide distribution (table 2). time to peak plasma concentration after oral
administration is approximately 2 h irrespective of dose [22],
and is nearly doubled by food [23]. other data however, suggest
that overall oral bioavailability is actually unaffected by food.
dofetilide is mainly eliminated (approximately 80%)
through the kidneys [24] via passive glomerular filtration and
cationic tubular secretion. the remainder is excreted in the
feces (<10%) or metabolized in the liver, predominantly by
the cytochrome p4503a4 family, into inactive metabolites
[25]. it exhibits first-order elimination kinetics with a half-life
of 8–10 h in patients with normal renal function. the
steady-state plasma concentration is reached by the third day
of a twice-daily dosing regimen.

isoenzyme should be cautiously coadministered with dofetilide
as they can potentially increase its levels. dofetilide is not
inhibitor p450 isoenzymes and is not expected to increase levels
of drugs metabolized by cyp3a4 [9]. dofetilide does not significantly affect the pharmacokinetics of digoxin [29], warfarin,
propanolol, theophylline, phenytoin or oral contraceptives.

by increasing myocardial refractoriness, there is shortening of the excitable
gap and a higher chance that the reentrant wavefront would encounter
refractoriness and be therefore terminated.

patients with renal impairment have decreased drug clearance,
higher plasma concentration and increased half-life. therefore, the dose should be decreased in these patients. patients
with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance
<20 ml/min) and patients on hemodialysis were not included
in clinical or pharmacological studies. on the other hand,
hepatic dysfunction does not significantly affect the
pharmacokinetic profile of dofetilide and dosage adjustment
is not required [26]. patients with severe hepatic impairment
were not studied. the elderly have reduced clearance of the
drug primarily because of decreased renal function. women
tend to have 14–22% higher plasma concentration than males
even after correcting for body weight and creatinine clearance,
with renal function being the most important factor influencing dofetilide clearance in both sexes. smoking and coronary
artery disease do not affect the disposition of dofetilide [27].
drug interactions

the concomitant use of verapamil, hydrochlorothiazide (alone
or in combinations such as with triamterene), cimetidine, trimethoprim (alone or in combination with sulfamethoxazole) or
ketoconazole with dofetilide is contraindicated, as each of these
drugs cause a substantial increase in dofetilide peak plasma concentration (cmax) [9]. cimetidine at 400 mg twice daily reduces
both the renal and hepatic clearance of dofetilide [28]. similarly,
ketoconazole (400 mg/day) and verapamil increased cmax by 53
and 42%, respectively. furthermore, verapamil increases the
absorption rate of dofetilide (by increasing gi blood flow) and
therefore decreases the time to peak concentration. other
known inhibitors of the renal cation transport system such as
 xxxd3018xxx  and  xxxd2557xxx  should not be used in patients

atrial fibrillation is one of the most common arrhythmias
observed in clinical practice, occurring in 5.9% of patients
older than 65 years [30], and is an independent risk factor for
thromboembolic events and stroke [31]. data from three main
randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled studies [32–36]
suggest that when compared with placebo, oral dofetilide has
higher rates of conversion to sinus rhythm, better maintenance
of sinus rhythm after conversion and better prevention of af in
patients with sinus rhythm at baseline.
the emerald study

the european and australian multicenter evaluative research on
atrial fibrillation dofetilide (emerald) study [32] included
671 patients with 1 week to 2 years history of af (median duration of 3 months) randomized to dofetilide in one of three doses
(125, 250 and 500 µg twice daily), sotalol (80 mg twice daily) or
placebo. dofetilide dose was adjusted for renal dysfunction and
qt prolongation. patients who did not convert to normal sinus
rhythm within 48–72 h received electrical cardioversion. a dose

response was noted across the dofetilide-treated groups. dofetilide at 500 µg twice daily was significantly more effective than
either placebo or sotalol (80 mg twice daily) in both the conversion and maintenance of normal sinus rhythm (nsr) (table 3).
pharmacological cardioversion to sinus rhythm at the initial
phase of the study was noted in 1% in the placebo group, 5% of
the sotalol group, 6% in the 125 µg twice daily 11% in the
250 µg twice daily and 29% in the 500 µg twice daily dofetilide
groups. the probabilities of remaining in nsr after either pharmacologic or electric cardioversion were 0.71 and 0.66 at 6 and
12 months respectively (dofetilide 500 µg twice daily group)
compared with 0.57 and 0.49 in the sotalol group and 0.26 and
0.21 in the placebo group. in the sotalol treated group, maintenance of nsr was similar to the dofetilide 250 µg twice daily
group. 70% of the patients who converted pharmacologically did
so within the first 24 h of treatment initiation. further dose
adjustment for either renal impairment or qt increase did not
affect treatment efficacy. efficacy was also consistent regardless of
age, gender or target arrhythmia (af or flutter).
the safire-d study

the safire-d study [36] randomized 325 patients who had
been in af for 2 weeks to 6 months to 125, 250 or 500 µg
dofetilide or placebo twice daily of the patients, 72% were in
nyha classes ii and iii. structural heart disease (including
myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, ischemic heart
disease, valvular heart disease, and dilated and obstructive cardiomyopathy) was present in 67% of patients. similar to the
emerald study, dofetilide restored sinus rhythm in a dosedependent manner. the conversion rates of the 250 and 500 µg
dofetilide groups (9.8 and 29.9%, respectively) were both significantly higher than with placebo (1.2%). of the patients
who converted pharmacologically, 70% did so within 24 h and
91% within 36 h. the probability of remaining in sinus
rhythm at 1 year was 0.4, 0.37 and 0.58 for the 125, 250 and
500-µg groups with the difference being significant for the
500-µg group (table 3).
the diamond-af substudy

the danish investigations of arrhythmia and mortality on
dofetilide (diamond) study consists of two separate randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group,
multicenter studies of safety and efficacy of oral dofetilide in
patients with chf [33] or recent mi [34]. those patients were
randomized to either placebo or dofetilide 500 µg bid but
this was reduced to 250 µg if patients had af. the incidence of
conversion to and maintenance of sinus rhythm in patients
with af at base line was analyzed as part of a predefined substudy. the diamond-af substudy [35] pooled subgroups of
patients (n = 506) with af in the two mentioned investigations. after 1 month of treatment, normal sinus rhythm was
restored in 12% of dofetilide-treated compared with 2% of
placebo-treated patients. dofetilide was a predictor of successful maintenance of sinus rhythm with a 1 year probability of
0.79 (table 3).

12

intravenous dofetilide was also used for conversion of af and
flutter. two placebo controlled trials of 91 and 96 patients
[37,38], showed that 4 or 8 µg/kg of intravenous dofetilide was
more effective than placebo for the reversion of the arrhythmia
with higher conversion rate for atrial flutter (15–24% for fibrillation and 54–64% for flutter). in a third controlled trial of
150 patients, intravenous dofetilide (8 µg/kg) was more effective than intravenous amiodarone (5 mg/kg) in restoring sinus
rhythm in patients with af or flutter, with a higher effectiveness with atrial flutter [39]. on the other hand, intravenous
dofetilide did not seem to be superior to placebo in converting
af after coronary artery bypass surgery [40].
paroxysmal af & flutter

as opposed to chronic af, there was only a trend in prolongation of time to recurrence of paroxysmal af in the dofetilidetreated patients as compared with placebo [41]. the potential
hypothesis is that dofetilide might not be effective for treating
the triggers of paroxysmal af (automatic foci) but is more
effective in nonparoxismal af through its effect on electrical
modulation of the atrial myocardium by increasing atrial effective refractory period and preventing perpetuation of af once
it occurs. study designs and the patient population being
studied might also account for these differences.
supraventricular tachycardia

a randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study compared the effectiveness of oral dofetilide 500 µg twice daily with
that of propafenone 150 mg t.i.d. and placebo in preventing the
recurrence of supraventricular tachycardia in 122 symptomatic
patients. after 6 months of treatment, dofetilide was as effective
as propafenone and more effective than placebo in preventing
the recurrence of (freedom from episodes in 50 and 54 vs 6%
for placebo) or decreasing the frequency of supraventricular
tachycardia [42]. in another study, intravenous dofetilide 2.5–5.0
µg/kg terminated supraventricular tachycardia in four of six
patients [43]. during the electrophysiologic study, dofetilide
completely suppressed the induction of supraventricular tachycardia in 7 of 13 patients, restricted the induction zone in 5, and
inhibited perpetuation of the arrhythmia in the remaining 1.
dofetilide was also used for the conversion of arrhythmias in
patients with wolf–parkinson–white syndrome (wpw). in
one small study of 15 males with wpw syndrome and af or
atrioventricular reentrant tachycardia induced in the electrophysiology laboratory, intravenous dofetilide converted the
arrhythmia in 71% with dofetilide compared with 20% for placebo [44]. in another study of 51 patients without structural
heart disease, intravenous dofetilide at 6–5 µg/kg prevented
reinduction of atrioventricular re-entrant tachycardia at a rate
of 36% [45].

agent to be approved for the treatment of ventricular arrhythmias since the cast study [2]. dofetilide 500 µg twice daily
was as efficacious as sotalol 160 mg twice daily in preventing
the induction of sustained ventricular tachycardia in a doubleblind randomized crossover study of 135 patients with
ischemic heart disease and inducible sustained ventricular
tachycardia (35.9 vs 33.6% respectively). similarly, in two
other studies, intravenous dofetilide suppressed or slowed
inducible ventricular tachycardia (vt) in about 40% of
patients [47,48].
dofetilide has little effect on suppression of asymptomatic
premature ventricular complexes and nonsustained ventricular tachycardia. it was less effective than amiodarone in suppressing asymptomatic premature ventricular complexes
(pvc) and nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (nsvt) in
patients with dilated or hypertrophic cardiomyopathy
(response rate of 90% in the amiodarone group vs 7% in the
dofetilide group). furthermore, in the diamond studies,
there was no significant difference in the incidence of polymorphic vt (other than torsades de pointes), monomorphic
vt or ventricular fibrillation [33,34] and no difference in suppression of asymptomatic pvcs or nsvt [33] in the dofetilide
group as compared with the placebo group.
device interaction

in patients undergoing implantable cardioverter defibrillator
(icd) implantation, intravenous dofetilide significantly
decreased defibrillation thresholds from 6.9 ± 3.7 joules at
baseline to 4.6 ± 2.6 joules [49]. this is thought to be the
result of enhancement of ‘shock-induced extension of refractoriness’ by dofetilide as shown in experimental animal models [50]. this effect is similar to that of sotalol but is opposite
to that of class i agents [51] and amiodarone which increase
defibrillation thresholds in patients with icds. dofetilide did
not significantly change pacing thresholds in patients with
permanent pacemakers.

effect on mortality

previous experience with antiarrhythmic agents in cast [2,3]
(cardiac arrhythmia suppression trial i and ii) and sword [4]
(survival with oral d-sotalol) showed increased risk of mortality
compared with placebo when agents like  xxxd2113xxx ,  xxxd1991xxx ,
 xxxd2669xxx  and d-sotalol were used in high-risk patients. the two
diamond studies [33,34], were 3-year trials comparing the
effects of prophylactic oral dofetilide on mortality and morbidity
in patients at high risk for sudden cardiac death. in both studies,
patients were randomized to receive either dofetilide 500 µg twice
daily with dose adjustment according to an algorithm (figure 3) or
placebo in addition to the best available medical therapy. dofetilide was initiated in the hospital and all patients were monitored
on telemetry for the first 3 days of treatment and treated for at
least 1 year. there were no statistically significant difference in
mortality between the placebo and dofetilide group in both studies: the 1 year mortality rate with dofetilide was similar to that
with placebo (chf patients 41%, post-mi patients 31%).
supraventricular arrhythmias

the effect of dofetilide on mortality was also evaluated in
patients with supraventricular arrhythmias. a pooled survival
analysis of data from 10 randomized clinical trials involving 1346
patients treated with dofetilide and 677 patients receiving placebo provided reassurance regarding the safety of this agent in
patients with supraventricular arrhythmias (low prevalence of
structural heart disease) [52]. oral dofetilide had no effects on
overall survival compared with placebo (figure 4). after adjusting
for effects of arrhythmia diagnosis, age, sex and structural heart
disease, the hazard ratio for risk of death with dofetilide versus
placebo was 1.1 (95% ci: 0.3–0.43).

was 70 years and 60% were nyha class iii or iv. there was
no significant difference in all cause mortality between the
dofetilide and placebo groups (mortality rate of 41 and 42%
respectively) after a median follow-up of 18 months (figure 4).
similar results were seen for cardiac deaths and arrhythmic
deaths. the dofetilide group also had a lower rate of hospitalization for worsening heart failure regardless of the presence of
af at baseline, in comparison to the placebo group. in dofetilide treated patients, the all cause mortality risk was significantly reduced in patients with a baseline qtc interval
<429 ms, while increased in patients with qtc interval
>479 ms [53].
recent myocardial infarction

the diamond-mi study [34] randomized 1510 patients hospitalized with recent myocardial infarction (2–7 days) who had
confirmed impaired left-ventricular function (ejection fraction
≤35%). the mean age was 68 years and 34% were in nyha
class iii or iv. all-cause mortality did not differ significantly
between the dofetilide and the placebo groups with a mortality
rate of 31 and 32% respectively (figure 4). there was no effect
on risk of cardiac death, total arrhythmic death or worsening
congestive heart failure.
atrial fibrillation

the diamond-af [35] studied 506 patients who had af at
entry to both diamond studies. the mean age was 72 years
and 56% were nyha class iii and iv. dofetilide had no effect
on all-cause mortality rate (45% in each dofetilide and placebo
group). in addition, all-cause and chf rehospitalization was
significantly reduced by dofetilide therapy.
comparison with other antiarrhythmics

similar to amiodarone, dofetilide does not affect mortality in
patients with impaired lv function and congestive heart failure
or post myocardial infarction, but this effect contrasts with the
increased mortality with  xxxd1991xxx  [2],  xxxd2113xxx  [2],
mexiletine [3], or d-sotalol [4]. the effects of dofetilide cannot
be directly compared with any of these other antiarrhythmic
agents because of the different populations of patients studied
and selection bias.
the sword trial evaluated d-sotalol in patients with lv
dysfunction and previous myocardial infarction, a patient
population somehow similar to that of the diamond trial.
it was stopped prematurely because of an increase in mortality, which was presumed to be primarily arrhythmic. several
reasons could have accounted for this difference in outcome
between these two ikr blockers: the mortality rate in the diamond study (31%) was much higher than in the sword
study (5%) which might reflect an acutely sicker patient population. in addition, diamond was an in-patient treatment initiation and the majority of torsades de pointes and
cardiac arrest that were excessive in the dofetilide group
occurred within the first three days when the patient was in a
monitored hospital setting. furthermore, the sword study

www.future-drugs.com

comprised a mix of an early and a remote mi group. the
remote mi group is different from the diamond population in that the average time was 4 years post mi. it is in that
group of patients with remote mi and preserved lvef
(31–40%), that almost two-thirds of all excessive deaths in
sword occurred whereas there was almost no deaths on
placebo [54]. for these reasons, these two trials could not be
directly compared.
similar differences exist with between the diamond studies and the emiat (european myocardial infarct amiodarone
trial) [55] and camiat (canadian amiodarone myocardial
infarction arrhythmia trial) [56] studies. the 2-year mortality
rates were about 15 and 11% in the emiat and camiat
respectively. the older population in the diamond trial
(5–9 years older) and the recruitment of patients soon after the
myocardial infarction in the diamond-mi trial resulted in a
study population at higher risk.
safety & tolerability

like all antiarrhythmic agents, the most worrisome side effect
related to dofetilide is proarrhythmia, specifically torsades de
pointes, because of its class iii action.
in studies of patients with supraventricular arrhythmias,
dofetilide was discontinued in 8.7% of patients (vs 8.0% in the
placebo groups) due to adverse events, the most frequent reason
being ventricular tachycardia (2.0 on dofetilide vs 1.3% on placebo) [52]. torsades de pointes is the only arrhythmia that
showed a dose–response relationship to dofetilide treatment. it
did not occur in placebo-treated patients. the incidence of torsades de pointes in patients with supraventricular arrhythmias
was 0.8%.
in the high risk population of the diamond studies, the
incidence of torsades de pointes was 3.3% in the congestive
heart failure patients and 0.9% in the patients with a recent
myocardial infarction, with respectively 76 and 57% occurring
in the first 3 days of initiation of therapy [33,34]. the frequency
of other ventricular arrhythmias was similar in the dofetilide
and placebo groups. adjusting the dose according to renal
function and continuous cardiac monitoring during the first
three days of treatment reduced the risk of torsades de pointes.
in the diamond-chf study, female sex and a nyha class
of iii and iv at baseline were significantly associated to occurrence of torsades de pointes after dose adjustment of dofetilide
to creatinine clearance.
although proarrhythmia with dofetilide is most typically
torsades de pointes in the first 3 days of therapy, two case
reports described runs of monomorphic ventricular tachycardia
shortly after the first dose and torsades de pointes following the
development of isolated ventricular premature beats during an
exercise test [57].
other side effects included headache, chest pain, dizziness,
dyspnea, nausea, insomnia, diarrhea, rash and abdominal discomfort. the incidence of clinically significant laboratory test
abnormalities were similar in patients on dofetilide and those
on placebo [9].

oral dofetilide has also been shown to adversely affect in
utero growth and survival of rats and mice when administered
during organogenesis at doses equal or more than 2 mg/kg/day.
there are no well controlled studies in pregnant women.
therefore, dofetilide should only be administered to pregnant
women where the benefit to the patient justifies the potential
risk to the fetus [9]. nursing mothers should be advised not to
breast feed an infant if they are taking dofetilide, since there is
no data on the presence of dofetilide in breast milk.
a total of 46% of all patients in clinical studies of dofetilide
were 65–89 years old. there is no difference in safety, effect on
qtc, or effectiveness between elderly and younger patients
except that elderly patients are more likely to have a reduced
creatinine clearance and care must be taken in dose selection [9].
conclusion

dofetilide is indicated for the conversion of af and flutter to
sinus rhythm and for the maintenance of sinus rhythm after
cardioversion. in high-risk patients with structural heart disease,
dofetilide offers a reasonable alternative to amiodarone in

a 1.0

patients at no additional risk for torsades de pointes, by virtue of
its efficacy, its neutral effect on mortality and the lack of long
term multiorgan side effects. dofetilide should be initiated in a
hospital setting with continuous cardiac monitoring for the first
3 days, or for a minimum of 12 h after cardioversion, whichever
is greater. the dosage should be individualized according to the
algorithm set for the diamond study (figure 3).
future studies comparing dofetilide to other currently used
antiarrhythmics would help further establish the role of dofetilide and determine its place in the treatment of atrial arrhythmias. in addition, drugs that could block more than one channel are currently being developed.  xxxd272xxx  is the first class iii
agent that blocks both the rapid and the slow component of the
delayed rectifier [57]. a number of other drugs, such as  xxxd1944xxx  and trecetilide, share k-channel-blocking properties and
are still under investigation [58]
identification of intracellular biochemical pathways and modulation of the molecular and genetic substrate involved in arrhythmogenesis is the other long term goal for the development of
antiarrhythmic therapy.

dofetilide: a new class iii antiarrhythmic agent

expert commentary & five-year view

despite the absence of therapeutic effect of dofetilide on ventricular arrhythmias and overall mortality in patients with
ischemic heart disease and heart failure, its use for the treatment of af and flutter has increased significantly over the
past few years. it offers yet another option for pharmacological therapy in this patient population with limited choices of
antiarrhythmic medications with an acceptable safety profile
when used in accordance to suggested guidelines. these
guidelines are fairly strict and might exclude the use of this
medication in patients with already wide qrs complex (and
secondarily long qt at baseline) such as patients with bundle
branch block and paced ventricular rhythm. in the most
recent revision of the acc/aha/esc (2006) guidelines for
the management of af, dofetilide was advanced to first line
antiarrhythmic drug choice for af patients post-mi or with
chf [59]. similar to most other antiarrhythmic drugs available, the risk of proarrhythmia and the overall limited efficacy

continues to plague the field of pharmacologic treatment of
atrial arrhythmias. the risk of proarrhythmia is predominantly related to the effect of this drug on the ventricular
myocardium with resultant delayed repolarization and the
potential for dispersion of refractoriness leading in certain situations to ventricular arrhythmias. therefore, drugs affecting
selective ion channels in the atria with minimal or no effect
on the ventricular myocardium would be theoretically valuable. such drugs would allow higher dosage treatment for better efficacy without the potential risk for ventricular proarrhythmia. some of these drugs with selective blockade of
ionic channels in the atria are being developed and investigated. on the other hand, af does not appear to be a disease
of ion channels and pharmacologic therapy directed at other
targets such as myocardial gap junctions and connexins, autonomic nervous system modulation among many others might
offer a more effective and safer alternative or adjunctive
therapy to ionic channel blockade.

key issues
• dofetilide is a class iii antiarrhythmic agent that selectively blocks the rapid component of the cardiac delayed rectifier current (ikr)
• dofetilide delays myocardial repolarization and increases myocardial refractoriness.
• dofetilide does not depress left-ventricular contractility and cardiac output.
• the concomitant use of verapamil, hydrochlorothiazide, cimetidine, trimethoprim or ketoconazole with dofetilide is contraindicated.
• oral dofetilide is effective in the conversion of atrial fibrillation and flutter to normal sinus rhythm and in the maintenance of sinus
rhythm after conversion.
• unlike other antiarrhythmic agents except amiodarone, oral dofetilide was not associated with an excess risk of mortality in high
risk patients with a recent myocardial infarction or with congestive heart failure. the presence of atrial fibrillation did not affect
outcome.
• torsades de pointes remains a major risk and is dose related. most episodes of torsades de pointes occurred within the first three
days of therapy.
• to minimize proarrhythmic risk, dofetilide dose must be adjusted to creatinine clearance and qt interval and treatment must be
initiated in a monitored hospital setting for 3 days.
