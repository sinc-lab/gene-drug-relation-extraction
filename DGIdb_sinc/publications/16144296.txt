open-label pilot study of  xxxd114xxx  gel 0.1% in the treatment of photoaging.   xxxd114xxx  (9- xxxd2404xxx ) is an fda-approved topical therapy for the treatment of kaposi sarcoma.  xxxd114xxx  is a naturally occurring endogenous retinoid that binds to and activates all known intracellular  xxxd3417xxx  receptor (rar) subtypes alpha, beta, and gamma and retinoic x receptor (rxr) subtypes alpha, beta, and gamma. photoaging of the skin is the result of accumulated exposure to solar uv radiation. several topically applied retinoids have been proven clinically effective for treating the appearance of photoaging. tretinoin and  xxxd3297xxx , which have been shown to improve photodamaged skin, bind rar subtypes only. the theoretic benefit of  xxxd114xxx  gel 0.1% ( xxxd114xxx ) in the treatment of photoaged skin stems from the binding and activation of both rars and rxrs, which promote the repair mechanisms in damaged skin. the objective of this study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of topical  xxxd114xxx  gel 0.1% in the treatment of photodamaged skin. the treatment was well tolerated by participants (n=20) and subjectively showed improvement of benign skin lesions (eg, seborrheic keratoses) and precancerous lesions (eg, actinic keratoses). larger, blinded, controlled trials are needed to investigate the role of this novel retinoid in the treatment of photoaging.
