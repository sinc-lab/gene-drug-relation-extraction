 xxxg353xxx  antagonist ym022 prevents hypersecretion after long-term acid suppression.  female rats were treated orally for 13 wk with ym022 (300 mumol.kg-1.day-1) and with omeprazole (400 mumol.kg-1.day-1) or  xxxd2082xxx  (900 mumol.kg-1.day-1) with or without ym022. at 2 h after the last dose, ym022 and omeprazole markedly inhibited basal and  xxxd2873xxx -induced acid secretion.  xxxd2082xxx  was less potent than ym022 and omeprazole against both secretions. the degree of increase in plasma gastrin level in the three groups was parallel to the antisecretory potencies of the drugs. at 14 days after the cessation of omeprazole treatment, the secretory response to  xxxd2873xxx  increased above that of the control. this hyperresponse lasted for > or = 56 days. in the  xxxd2082xxx -treated group, a small increase in secretory response to  xxxd2873xxx  was observed but was not statistically significant. the increase in secretory response to  xxxd2873xxx  was paralleled by an increase in mucosal cell mass. in contrast, ym022 not only exhibited a long-lasting inhibition of  xxxd2873xxx -induced acid secretion but also prevented the hyperresponse to  xxxd2873xxx  caused by omeprazole. these results indicate that the hypergastrinemia caused by long-term administration of antisecretory drugs increases mucosal secretory response to  xxxd2873xxx  through a gastrin/ xxxg353xxx -mediated pathway in rats.
