small molecule  xxxg2198xxx  inhibitors (tkis) are developed to block intracellular signaling
pathways in tumor cells, leading to deregulation of key cell functions such as proliferation and
differentiation. over 25 years ago, tyrosine kinases were found to function as oncogenes in
animal carcinogenesis; however, only recently tkis were introduced as anti cancer drugs
in human cancer treatment.  xxxg2198xxx  inhibitors have numerous good qualities. first, in
many tumor types they tend to stabilize tumor progression and may create a chronic disease
state which is no longer immediately life threatening. second, side effects are minimal when
compared to conventional chemotherapeutic agents. third, synergistic effects are seen in vitro
when tkis are combined with radiotherapy and/or conventional chemotherapeutic agents. in
this article, we will give an update of the  xxxg2198xxx  inhibitors that are currently registered
for use or in an advanced stage of development, and we will discuss the future role of tkis in
the treatment of solid tumors. the following tkis are reviewed: imatinib (gleevec/glivec),
geﬁtinib (iressa),  xxxd2029xxx  (osi-774, tarceva), lapatinib ( xxxd2445xxx , tykerb),  xxxd421xxx 
( xxxd421xxx ), sunitinib ( xxxd3264xxx , sutent),  xxxd3489xxx  (zd6474),  xxxd3496xxx  ( xxxd3496xxx ),
sorafenib ( xxxd3226xxx , nexavar), and leﬂunomide ( xxxd2450xxx , arava).

tyrosine kinases (tks) are enzymes that catalyze
the phosphorylation of tyrosine residues. there are
two main classes of tks: receptor tks and cellular
tks. receptor tks have an extracellular ligand
binding domain, a transmembrane domain, and an
intracellular catalytic domain. the kinase is activated
by binding of a ligand (mostly growth factors) to the
extracellular domain, leading to dimerization of the
receptors and autophosphorylation of the tyrosine
residues of the intracellular catalytic domain. this
results in an active receptor conformation and activation of signal transduction within the cell. cellular

conventional chemotherapeutical agents act by
creating toxic eﬀects on all dividing cells, frequently
resulting in severe damage of normal tissues leading
to side eﬀects like myelosuppression, alopecia, or
gastrointestinal problems. the optimum goal is to
ﬁnd a treatment modality that speciﬁcally kills
malignant cells and causes little or no side eﬀects.
targeted therapies were developed to target key elements that play a role in tumor development and
tumor growth, with hormonal therapy in breast
cancer being the oldest targeted therapy known in
oncology. a more recent discovery are the tyrosine
kinase inhibitors, developed to block intracellular

small molecule  xxxg2198xxx  inhibitors update

fig. 1.  xxxg2198xxx  activation and the
mapk/erk intracellular signaling pathway;
mechanism of action of  xxxg2198xxx 
inhibitors (tkis). the mapk/erk intracellular signaling pathway is an example of one of
the pathways that can be activated by binding
of a ligand (mostly growth factors) to the
receptor  xxxg2198xxx . atp binds to the
 xxxg2198xxx  and auto-phosphorylation
takes place, resulting in activation of the
mapk/erk intracellular signaling pathway.
an activated erk dimer can translocate to the
nucleus where it phosphorylates a variety of
transcription factors regulating gene expression.  xxxg2198xxx  inhibitors block the
atp-binding site of the  xxxg2198xxx  and
therefore inhibit the activation of the intracellular signaling pathway, resulting in
blockage of protein synthesis necessary for
proliferation and differentiation of the tumour
cells.

tks are located in the cytoplasm, nucleus, or at the
intracellular side of the plasma membrane. tyrosine
kinases are involved in cellular signaling pathways
and regulate key cell functions such as proliferation,
diﬀerentiation, anti-apoptotic signaling, and neurite
outgrowth (fig. 1).4
unregulated activation of tks, through mechanisms such as point mutations or over-expression,
can lead to various forms of cancer as well as benign
proliferative conditions.5 these ﬁndings lead to the
hypothesis that inhibitors of tks could have antitumor effects, and many  xxxg2198xxx  inhibitors
(tkis) were subsequently developed.1,5 today, there
are two main mechanisms to block the activation of a
 xxxg2198xxx . first, the tki can block the atpbinding side and prohibit the autophosphorylation of
the tyrosine residues, and therefore prohibit the
activation of the intracellular signal-transduction
pathways. these drugs are usually referred to as
small molecule  xxxg2198xxx  inhibitors. second, a
monoclonal antibody can occupy the extracellular
ligand domain of the receptor  xxxg2198xxx  and
prohibit binding of the actual ligand and, therefore,
prohibit activation of the intracellular signal-transduction pathways.
in this article, we will focus on the small molecule
 xxxg2198xxx  inhibitors. the development and
registration of new small molecule  xxxg2198xxx 
inhibitors is proceeding remarkably fast. therefore,
frequent new updates of small molecule  xxxg2198xxx  inhibitors are very relevant for physicians

treating cancer patients. in this article, we will give an
update of the  xxxg2198xxx  inhibitors that are
currently registered for use or in an advanced stage of
development, and we will discuss the future role of
tkis in the treatment of solid tumors.
c-kit  xxxg2198xxx  inhibitors
imatinib (sti-571, gleevec (in us), glivec
(in europe))
imatinib is a small molecule that reversibly competes with atp for binding to the kinase domain of
the c-kit,  xxxg23xxx   xxxg24xxx , and platelet-derived growth factor
receptor-b ( xxxg1709xxx   xxxg1710xxx -b) tyrosine kinases. imatinib
was the ﬁrst commercially available as a small molecule  xxxg2198xxx  inhibitor, giving astonishing
results in patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia (cml) by inhibiting the phosphorylation of the
bcr-abl tk, and thereby suppressing the proliferation of bcr-abl expressing leukemic cells. a phase ii
study was performed in approximately 1000 patients
with cml, with patients in the chronic phase
receiving 400 mg of imatinib orally a day, and patients in accelerated phase or blast crisis receiving 600
mg/day. complete hematological responses were seen
in 91% of the patients in chronic phase cml, 53% of
patients in accelerated phase cml, and 26% of patients in blast crisis. however, in the late-stages disease, the eﬀects were short lasting, with a recurrence
of imatinib-resistant cells within months.6 in this
article, we will focus on the results in solid tumors.

n. steeghs et al.

in gastrointestinal stromal tumors (gists), imatinib also showed remarkable results.7,8 imatinib
blocks the c-kit  xxxg2198xxx , which is constantly
activated in 90% of gists by a gain-of-function
mutation in the c-kit proto-oncogene.9 approximately 30–50% of gists that harbour no c-kit
mutation do have pdgf mutations, and depending
on the subtype of the pdgf mutation these gists
are also sensitive to imatinib. the highest responses
were seen in gists with exon 11 mutations and,
the more rare, pdgf mutations.9,10 approximately
5–10% of gists are negative for both c-kit and
pdgf mutations. in a phase iii trial reported in
2004, 946 patients were randomized for treatment
with 400 mg imatinib once daily or 400 mg twice
daily.11 complete responses were seen in 5 vs. 6%,
partial responses in 45 vs. 48%, and stable disease in
32 vs. 32% of patients. at median follow-up of 760
days, 56% in the group receiving imatinib 400 mg
once daily showed progression of the disease, compared with 50% of patients receiving 400 mg twice
daily. side effects were frequent but mostly mild.
anemia, edema, fatigue, nausea, pleuritic pain, diarrhea, granulocytopenia, and rash were the most
common side effects. these were impressive results
for a tumor type that, until recently, was poorly affected by chemo- or radiotherapy and for small
molecule tkis in general. therefore, studies were
initiated to explore the role of imatinib in the adjuvant setting in high risk patients with gists. currently, the results of these studies with adjuvant
imatinib in high and intermediate risk gist are
awaited. resistance to imatinib in gists is a well
known problem and can be caused by secondary
mutations or c-kit ampliﬁcation. therefore, other
therapies for gists are being explored, like sunitinib
(see chapter on sunitinib).12
imatinib is also designated as orphan drug for the
treatment of dermatoﬁbrosarcoma protuberans
(dfsp), based on case reports of this rare tumor
type, in cases that can not be managed with surgery
alone.13,14 the cutaneous malignant mesenchymal
tumor dermatoﬁbrosarcoma protuberans is typically
associated with a translocation between chromosomes 17 and 22, involving the platelet-derived
growth factor-b (pdgf-b) gene, forming a ring
chromosome. imatinib inhibits the growth of these
tumor cells by inhibiting  xxxg1709xxx   xxxg1710xxx   xxxg2198xxx .
imatinibõs activity in advanced aggressive ﬁbromatosis (desmoid tumor) and, to a lesser extent, in
advanced chordoma may also be based on  xxxg1709xxx   xxxg1710xxx -b
inhibition. in a recently published article, 3 out of 19
desmoid patients demonstrated a partial response,
ann. surg. oncol. vol. 14, no. 2, 2007

with 4 additional patients showing stable disease for
more than one year.15 in a multicenter phase ii trial,
51 patients with advanced aggressive ﬁbromatosis
were treated with imatinib 300 mg po bid. at the
time of analysis, 45 patients were evaluable. median
time to treatment failure was 6.8 months. remarkably, in only 1 of 22 available tumor specimens a
 xxxg1709xxx   xxxg1710xxx  mutation was found.16 in chordoma patients, the effect was often less clear on ct-scan, but
in some cases clearly by subjective improvement of
complaints.17 recent clinical studies suggest that
there might also be an effect of imatinib in glioblastoma multiforme and malignant gliomas by inhibiting  xxxg1709xxx   xxxg1710xxx   xxxg2198xxx .18–21
imatinib inhibited growth of small-cell lung cancer
(sclc) cells in vitro by inhibiting c-kit; however,
there was no objective tumor response in sclc patients in vivo. this was probably caused by the fact
that there was no c-kit mutation detectable in most
of the patients.22,23 this was also seen in other tumor
types, like uterine leiomyosarcomas.24
egfr/ xxxg682xxx  and her2  xxxg2198xxx  inhibitors
the her-family of tyrosine kinases consists of
four members:  xxxg682xxx  (human epidermal growth
factor receptor: egfr,  xxxg682xxx ), her2 (erbb2),
 xxxg722xxx  ( xxxg722xxx ), and  xxxg723xxx  ( xxxg723xxx ). after binding of a
receptor-speciﬁc ligand homodimeric or heterodimeric complexes are formed. her-kinase activation
deregulates growth, desensitises cells to apoptotic
stimuli, and regulates angiogenesis.25 overexpression
of egfr and her2 is a factor of poor prognosis in a
variety of malignancies, including breast cancer,
ovarian cancer, and lung cancer.26,27
geﬁtinib (iressa)
geﬁtinib was the ﬁrst commercially available
egfr tki and is now registered for use in asia and
the united states in second- or third line therapy for
advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (nsclc). two
phase ii trials evaluated the eﬃcacy of geﬁtinib in
patients with advanced nsclc: ideal (iressa dose
evaluation in advanced lung cancer)-1 and
ideal-2. ideal-1 included 210 patients in europe,
australia, south africa, and japan who had previously received one or two chemotherapy regimens,
with at least one containing platinum. ideal-2 included 216 patients in the united states who had
failed two or more prior chemotherapy regimens
containing platinum and docetaxel. patients were
randomized for continuous treatment with 250 or
500 mg geﬁtinib monotherapy once daily orally.

small molecule  xxxg2198xxx  inhibitors update

ideal-1 showed that geﬁtinib dosage of 250 and
500 mg/day were equally eﬀective, with an objective
tumor response of 18% and 19% respectively.28 the
objective tumor response rate in ideal-2 was 12%
in the 250 mg/day geﬁtinib patients and 9% in the 500
mg/day patients.29 the difference in response was
most likely caused by the worse performance status in
ideal-2, a higher number of previous chemotherapy regiments in ideal-2, and the japanese origin
of a subset of patients in ideal-1 (which later became correlated with an higher number of activating
mutations in the egfr gene).30 overall survival was
18.5 (ideal-1) and 16.3 (ideal-2) months in patients with complete or partial response, 8.5 and 9.4
months in stable disease, and 3.8 and 4.2 months in
progressive disease. most reported side effects were
cutaneous and gastrointestinal complaints. since the
use of geﬁtinib became more widespread, a more
serious side effect, pulmonary ﬁbrosis, was noted in
approximately 1% of patients.31,32 the recommended
dose for use was established at 250 mg/day while this
was equally effective and better tolerated.
in large phase iii studies, intact-1 and-2, geﬁtinib in combination with chemotherapy in previously untreated nsclc patients did not show
improved eﬃcacy over chemotherapy alone.33,34 a
placebo-controlled phase iii trial randomizing
nsclc patients in second- or third-line treatment
for treatment with geﬁtinib 250 mg/day or placebo
plus best supportive care also did not show any survival beneﬁt.35
in the approval of geﬁtinib, the egfr status of the
tumor was not included in selecting patients for
treatment. patient characteristics that were associated
with responsiveness to egfr inhibitors were histologic features of adenocarcinoma, female sex, no
history of smoking, and asian ancestry. the egfr
level in immunohistochemical staining does not predict response to egfr inhibiting therapies and does
not correlate with poor survival.36–38 recent studies
reported an activating mutation in the  xxxg2198xxx 
side of the egfr gene in nsclc that seemed predictive for response to geﬁtinib treatment.39–41 for
future use of geﬁtinib, it will be highly important to
select those patients that are likely to beneﬁt from this
egfr-tki, while non-selection is probably the main
cause of the disappointing results of geﬁtinib.
phase ii studies with geﬁtinib monotherapy or
combination therapy have been conducted in many
tumor types, including esophageal carcinoma, metastatic breast cancer, prostate cancer, head and neck
cancer, colorectal cancer, renal cell carcinoma, and
ovarian carcinoma.42–53 in egfr expressing colo-

945

rectal cancer (crc), the monoclonal antibody cetuximab has been proven active.54,55 therefore,
beneﬁcial effects of egfr tkis were expected.
however, recent trials showed no effect of geﬁtinib in
crc patients. of the 115 geﬁtinib treated patients,
only one patient obtained a partial response, progression free survival was 1.9 months, and median
survival 6.3 months. no signiﬁcant changes in biological indicator of egfr pathway activation were
detected.52 however, a second phase ii trial reported
partial responses in 78% of patients treated with
geﬁtinib in combination with ﬂuorouracil and oxaliplatin (folfox-4).56 many trials with geﬁtinib for
various tumor types are still ongoing.
 xxxd2029xxx  (osi-774, tarceva)
 xxxd2029xxx  is an egfr tki with proven eﬃcacy in
monotherapy phase ii trials in nsclc, ovarian
cancer, pancreatic cancer, head and neck squamous
cell cancer, and primary glioblastoma.57–59
a survival beneﬁt of  xxxd2029xxx  compared with best
supportive care was reported in previously treated
nsclc patients.60 patients with stage iiib or iv
nsclc were randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to
receive oral  xxxd2029xxx , at a dose of 150 mg daily, or
placebo. the response rate was 8.9 percent in the
 xxxd2029xxx  group and less than 1 percent in the placebo
group. progression-free survival was 2.2 months and
1.8 months, respectively. in contrast to the trial with
geﬁtinib,35 the study comparing  xxxd2029xxx  with best
supportive care60 did show improved survival for
 xxxd2029xxx  treated patients. the trials were similarly
designed; however, the strict inclusion criterion
describing refractory disease in the geﬁtinib trial may
have resulted in a different patient population. after
the publication of these trials, clinicians favored the
use of  xxxd2029xxx  over geﬁtinib. however, a trial directly comparing the two drugs was never started.
in phase iii trials (talent and tribute) in
nsclc patients, there was no additional beneﬁt of
 xxxd2029xxx  in combination with chemotherapy, compared to chemotherapy alone.61,62  xxxd2029xxx  is registered for the second- and third-line treatment of
patients with advanced nsclc after failure of at
least one prior platinum treatment.
since late 2005,  xxxd2029xxx  is also registered for advanced pancreatic cancer. a phase iii trial in 569
chemotherapy-naı̈ve patients with advanced pancreatic cancer reported an improval in 1-year survival
from 17% to 24% when  xxxd2029xxx  100 mg daily was
added to gemcitabine 1000 mg/m2/week, compared to
gemcitabine alone.63 median overall survival increased from 5.9 months to 6.4 months. egfr status

was not an entry criterion; however, tumor samples
are being evaluated for egfr expression by immunohistochemistry. current studies in pancreatic
cancer patients focus on combination with chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and other targeted therapies,
or on maintenance therapy of  xxxd2029xxx .
a phase ii study of  xxxd2029xxx  in patients with advanced biliary cancer showed a potentially beneﬁcial
eﬀect of  xxxd2029xxx . progression free survival at
6 months was 17% and partial responses were seen in
3 of 42 patients.64 earlier, the same author reported
a phase ii study of  xxxd2029xxx  in hepatocellular cancer
patients. progression free survival at 6 months was
32%, and partial responses were seen in 3 of 38 patients.65 phase ii trials in metastatic colorectal carcinoma patients with  xxxd2029xxx  alone or in
combination with chemotherapy showed promising
results.66,67  xxxd2029xxx  150 mg orally daily, in combination with bevacizumab 10 mg/kg intravenously
every 2 weeks, was evaluated in 63 patients with
metastatic clear-cell renal carcinoma, which resulted
in a median survival of 11 months and 1-year progression-free survival of 43%. treatment was well
tolerated; skin rash and diarrhea were the most frequent treatment-related toxicities.68
the most frequent reported adverse events in  xxxd2029xxx  treatment are skin rash and diarrhea. the
incidence of interstitial lung disease in patients
receiving  xxxd2029xxx  was equal to that in geﬁtinib,
approximately 1%.69,70
lapatinib ( xxxd2445xxx , tykerb)
lapatinib is an egfr and her2  xxxg2198xxx 
inhibitor.71 phase i studies in trastuzumab refractory
breast cancer and nsclc demonstrated clear tumor
responses.72 in a phase ii study in 86 patients with
metastatic colorectal cancer, effects of lapatinib were
minor, with 1 partial response, 5 minor responses,
and 5 patients with stable disease.73 reported adverse
events were diarrhea and skin rash.
an international, multicenter, randomized, openlabel phase iii trial in patients with documented
her2 overexpressing refractory advanced or metastatic breast cancer treated with lapatinib in combination with  xxxd425xxx  versus  xxxd425xxx  alone
was recently stopped after the interim analysis. at the
time of interim analysis, 392 patients had been enrolled in the study, of which 321 were included in the
analysis (161 in the combination arm and 160 in the
monotherapy arm). median time to progression in
the combination arm was 8.5 months, compared with
4.5 months in the  xxxd425xxx  alone arm.74 the
addition of lapatinib to  xxxd425xxx  resulted in such
ann. surg. oncol. vol. 14, no. 2, 2007

a striking increase in time to progression that this
combination will probably be used by clinicians as
standard of care in patients with advanced her2positive breast cancer that failed on trastuzumab.
however lapatinib is not yet registered for use in this,
or any, indication.
in a phase iii trial, patients with advanced renal
cell carcinoma (rcc) who failed prior cytokine
therapy were randomized to receive oral lapatinib
1250 mg od or hormone therapy. at the time of the
analysis, 417 patients were randomized. in the general study-population, median time to progression
and median overall survival did not diﬀer between the
two groups. in the egfr overexpressing patients,
median time to progression was 15.1 months in the
lapatinib treated patients, vs. 10.9 weeks in the hormone therapy treated patients. the reported median
overall survival was 46.0 vs. 37.9 weeks.75
phase ii results on the use of lapatinib in breast
cancer patients with brain metastases, locally advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the head and
neck, biliary carcinoma, and hepatocellular carcinoma have recently been reported at the 2006 asco
annual meeting (http://www.asco.org).
 xxxd421xxx  ( xxxd421xxx )
 xxxd421xxx  is a  xxxg2198xxx  inhibitor that nonselectively inhibits all members of the her-family.
this might result in a broader spectrum of anti tumor
activity. in phase i studies, reported adverse events
were diarrhea, rash, anorexia.76 in a phase ii study in
patients with platinum-refractory or recurrent ovarian cancer,  xxxd421xxx  did not show activity in
unscreened patients.77 studies in breast cancer and
nsclc are currently ongoing.
 xxxg2413xxx   xxxg2198xxx 
inhibitors
the  xxxg2413xxx  (vegf)
family belongs to the platelet-derived growth factor
(pdgf) superfamily and consists of  xxxg2413xxx , -b,
-c, -d, -e, and the  xxxg1734xxx  ( xxxg1734xxx ).
 xxxg2413xxx  (normally referred to as vegf) is the most
potent endothelial growth factor. it contributes to
tumor angiogenesis and presumably to tumor growth
and haematogenous spread of tumor cells.78 moreover,  xxxg2413xxx  protects endothelial cells from apoptosis and contributes to the maintenance of the
vascular system.79,80
most of the vegf receptor ( xxxg800xxx   xxxg802xxx   xxxg1274xxx ) kinase
inhibitors under investigation inhibited multiple kinases not involved in angiogenesis, resulting in diverse

small molecule  xxxg2198xxx  inhibitors update

side eﬀects. new  xxxg800xxx   xxxg802xxx   xxxg1274xxx  kinase inhibitors are being
developed to selectively target a small subset of protein kinases, and therefore minimalize the side-eﬀects.
sunitinib ( xxxd3264xxx , sutent)
sunitinib is an orally available inhibitor of
 xxxg800xxx   xxxg802xxx   xxxg1274xxx ,  xxxg1709xxx   xxxg1710xxx , c-kit, and  xxxg801xxx  kinase activity.
in a phase ii study in patients with immunotherapy
refractory metastatic renal cell carcinoma treated
with sunitinib (6-week cycles: 50 mg orally once daily
for 4 weeks, followed by 2 weeks oﬀ), 40% of patient
showed a partial response and 27% stable disease.81
when the results were combined with a second study
with an identical patient population, the total evaluable patient population was 168 patients. objective
responses were seen in 42% and stable disease of 3 or
more months in 24%. median progression free survival was 8.2 months.82 these response rates were
much higher than seen with any other systemic
treatment in rcc. the main adverse effects were
fatigue, diarrhea, nausea, dyspepsia, stomatitis, and
bone marrow abnormalities. motzer reported the
results of a phase iii study comparing sunitinib
(6-week cycles: 50 mg orally once daily for 4 weeks,
followed by 2 weeks off) to ifn-a (6-week cycles:
subcutaneous injection 9 mu given three times
weekly) as ﬁrst line therapy for metastatic renal cell
cancer patients. there was a statistically signiﬁcant
improvement in median progression free survival
(47.3 vs. 24.9 weeks) and objective response rate
(24.8% vs. 4.9%) for sunitinib over ifn-a.83 sunitinib
might therefore now be considered the new standard
ﬁrst-line treatment for advanced kidney cancer.
in january 2006, sunitinib was not only approved
by the fda for advanced renal cell carcinoma, but
also for imatinib-resistant and imatinib-intolerant
gist. this was based on the early results of a phase
iii trial in patients with documented progression of
gist on imatinib.84,85 patients were treated with a
starting dose of 50 mg sunitinib once daily for four
weeks, followed by 2 weeks off treatment, in repetitive 6-week cycles (n = 207) or placebo (n = 105).
due to the positive results found at a planned interim
analysis, the trial was unblinded and all patients
started treatment with sunitinib. partial response was
seen in 6.8% of sunitinib treated patients, compared
to 0% in the placebo group. stable disease for more
than 22 weeks occurred in 17.4%, compared to 1.9%.
time to progression was signiﬁcantly longer in the
sunitinib treated patients, 27.3 weeks compared to 6.4
weeks. the most common non-hematological adverse
events were fatigue, diarrhea, nausea, sore mouth,
and skin discoloration.

947

from a biological point of view, continuous
dosing of sunitinib seems more logical. a study in
28 patients with advanced imatinib-resistant gist
explored the continuous daily 37.5 mg dosing regimen, which was feasible and associated with similar
tolerability as is seen with intermittent sunitinib
dosing.86
sunitinib showed a potentially beneﬁcial eﬀect in
previously treated advanced nsclc and unresectable neuroendocrine tumors in phase ii studies.87,88
 xxxd3489xxx  (zd6474)
 xxxd3489xxx  is an orally available, small molecule, dual
vegf receptor-2 ( xxxg1274xxx ) and egfr tyrosine
kinase inhibitor.  xxxd3489xxx  has the potential to directly
inhibit tumor cell proliferation and survival by
blocking egfr and inhibit tumor angiogenesis by
blocking vegf activity.  xxxd3489xxx  inhibits vegf
signaling and angiogenesis in vivo and shows broadspectrum antitumor activity in a range of histologically diverse tumor xenograft models.89 in phase i
trials, dose limiting toxicities were diarrhea, hypertension, thrombocytopenia, and prolongation of the
cardiac qt interval. phase ii assessment of  xxxd3489xxx  is
now in progress in a variety of tumor types in single
and combination regimens.90,91 in early reports of
two phase ii studies of  xxxd3489xxx  in combination with
docetaxel or carboplatin and paclitaxel for nsclc,
 xxxd3489xxx  did not signiﬁcantly increase toxicity compared to chemotherapy alone.92 in the study reported
by heymach, patients with locally advanced or metastatic (stage iiib/iv) nsclc after failure of ﬁrstline platinum-based chemotherapy were randomized
to treatment with  xxxd3489xxx  100 mg orally once daily
plus docetaxel (75 mg/m2 i.v. infusion every 21 days)
(n = 42),  xxxd3489xxx  300 mg orally once daily plus
docetaxel (n = 44), or docetaxel alone (n = 41).
median progression free survival was higher in the
combination therapy treated groups (19 vs. 17 vs. 12
weeks respectively).93 this resulted in the initiation of
a phase iii evaluation of  xxxd3489xxx  plus docetaxel in
second-line nsclc.
in a double-blind, randomized phase ii trial, 168
patients with nsclc were randomized for initial
treatment with  xxxd3489xxx  300 mg or geﬁtinib 250 mg.
 xxxd3489xxx  demonstrated a signiﬁcant prolongation of

 xxxd3496xxx  ( xxxd3496xxx  ( xxxg1890xxx /zk))
 xxxd3496xxx  is an oral inhibitor of a number of kinases including  xxxg800xxx  and  xxxg1274xxx  as well as
the platelet-derived growth factor receptor ( xxxg1709xxx   xxxg1710xxx ). it clearly demonstrated an anti-tumor eﬀect
in several solid tumor types. adverse events were
lightheadedness, fatigue, transaminase elevation,
hypertension, nausea, and vomiting.96 dynamic
contrast-enhanced molecular resonance imaging
(dce-mri) in patients with advanced colorectal
carcinoma and liver metastases showed a  xxxd3496xxx 
dose-dependent reduction of vascular permeability
and blood ﬂow in the liver metastases.97 a phase iii
study (confirm-1, colorectal oral novel therapy
for the inhibition of angiogenesis and retarding of
metastases in first-line) showed no beneﬁcial effects
of adding  xxxd3496xxx  to chemotherapy (oxaliplatin/5ﬂuorouracil/ xxxd2462xxx  (folfox4)) in metastatic
colorectal cancer patients.98 a second phase iii study
in 855 pretreated patients with metastatic colorectal
carcinoma (confirm-2, colorectal oral novel
therapy for the inhibition of angiogenesis and
retarding of metastases in second-line) demonstrated a signiﬁcant improvement in progression free
survival when  xxxd3496xxx  1250 mg qd was added to
folfox. overall survival was the same in both
treatment arms.99 combination and monotherapy
trials are currently also conducted in other tumor
types.
sorafenib ( xxxd3226xxx , nexavar)
sorafenib is a novel oral  xxxg1924xxx  kinase, platelet-derived growth factor receptor ( xxxg1709xxx   xxxg1710xxx ) and  xxxg800xxx   xxxg802xxx   xxxg1274xxx 
kinase inhibitor with antitumor eﬀects in colon, pancreas and breast cancer cell lines and in colon, breast
and non-small-cell lung cancer xenograft models.100 a
phase i study in 69 patients with refractory solid
tumors reported promising results.101 dose limiting
toxicities were hematological toxicity, diarrhea, fatigue, hypertension, and skin rash. in a recent phase ii
randomized discontinuation trial in patients with
metastatic renal cell carcinoma, sorafenib showed
anti-tumor activity and was well tolerated.102,103 an
interim analysis of a phase iii trial randomizing 769
patients with advanced rcc to sorafenib 400 mg bid
or placebo reported an improvement of progression
free survival from 12 weeks to 24 weeks in sorafenib
treated patients compared to placebo.104 updated
results reported at the asco 2006 meeting showed a
survival beneﬁt for sorafenib over placebo (median
overall survival of 19.3 months vs. 15.9 months).105
sorafenib was granted fda fast track approval in
december 2005.

phase iii trials in stage iii or iv melanoma and in
advanced hepatocellular carcinoma, and phase ii
trials in multiple tumor types are currently ongoing.
it has previously been suggested that rash commonly associated with egf-pathway inhibitors could
be predictive of treatment outcome, and that the
onset of rash could be used for optimal dose titration.106 this might also be effective in treatment with
sorafenib, as it is an inhibitor of  xxxg1924xxx , which is
a downstream effector molecule of the egfr signaling pathway. a recent report combining data from
four phase i trials supported this hypothesis. patients
receiving sorafenib dosed at or close to the recommended dose of 400 mg bid, and experiencing skin
toxicity and/or diarrhea, had a signiﬁcantly increased
time to progression compared with patients without
such toxicity.107 blood pressure has also been reported as a possible biomarker in patients treated
with sorafenib and other vegf inhibitors.108,109
platelet-derived growth factor  xxxg2198xxx 
inhibitors
platelet-derived growth factor (pdgf) and its
 xxxg2198xxx  receptor ( xxxg1709xxx   xxxg1710xxx ) have been implicated in the pathogenesis of a number of tumor types
and play an important role in various cellular functions, including growth, proliferation, diﬀerentiation,
and angiogenesis.110 multiple  xxxg1709xxx   xxxg1710xxx  kinase inhibitors have been evaluated in human solid tumors;
many are not speciﬁc for pdgf and act on a number
of  xxxg2198xxx  receptors. examples are imatinib
(bcr-abl, c-kit,  xxxg1709xxx   xxxg1710xxx ), sunitinib ( xxxg800xxx   xxxg802xxx   xxxg1274xxx ,
 xxxg1709xxx   xxxg1710xxx , c-kit, and  xxxg801xxx  kinase),  xxxd3496xxx 
( xxxg800xxx   xxxg802xxx   xxxg1274xxx ,  xxxg1709xxx   xxxg1710xxx , c-kit), sorafenib (c- xxxg1924xxx ,
b-raf,  xxxg800xxx   xxxg802xxx   xxxg1274xxx ,  xxxg1709xxx   xxxg1710xxx ), and leﬂunomide ( xxxd2450xxx ;
 xxxg1709xxx   xxxg1710xxx , egfr, fgfr).111
leﬂunomide ( xxxd2450xxx , arava)
leﬂunomide is a small molecule inhibitor of the
 xxxg1709xxx   xxxg1710xxx   xxxg2198xxx  and partially inhibits egfr
and the ﬁbroblast growth factor receptor (fgfr).
leﬂunomide is an immunomodulatory agent that is
indicated in adults for treatment of active rheumatoid
arthritis. it has demonstrated broad-spectrum antitumor activity in preclinical studies. a multicenter
phase ii study in hormone refractory prostate cancer
patients treated with leﬂunomide showed partial responses in 1 of 19 patients, a prostate-speciﬁc antigen
decline greater than 50% in 3 of 39 patients, and
improvement in pain in nine of 35 evaluable patients.
the patients received a 4-day i.v. loading dose of
 xxxd2450xxx  at 400 mg/m2 for 4 consecutive days, followed

by 10 weekly infusions at 400 mg/m2. despite the
detection of  xxxg1709xxx   xxxg1710xxx  overexpression in 80% of the
metastases and 88% of the primary tumors, these
were disappointing results.112 the most frequently
reported side effects with leﬂunomide were asthenia,
nausea, anorexia, and anemia.

multiforme in ﬁrst relapse, and a phase ii/iii randomized study of leﬂunomide with mitoxantrone and
prednisone versus mitoxantrone and prednisone

cancer have just ﬁnished recruiting. results have not
yet been reported.
tyrosine kinases as a target: success or failure?
imatinib (gleevec/glivec) was the ﬁrst small molecule tki that was successfully developed. the results of imatinib in gist, a tumor that is poorly
aﬀected by chemotherapy and radiotherapy, were
astonishing and lead to a boost in research of small
molecule  xxxg2198xxx  inhibitors in solid tumors.
the results of these investigations in other solid tumors were not as astonishing, although substantial
eﬀects were seen in many diﬀerent tumor types.
there are multiple reasons for this more modest
eﬀect in other solid tumors. first, most tumor cells
harbor multiple genetic defects, and inhibiting one
 xxxg2198xxx  might not be suﬃcient. second,
inhibiting tyrosine kinases leads to a stop in cell
division, and lack of further growth is therefore the
maximum achieved goal. third, inhibiting an intracellular signaling pathway by a tki can be overcome
by tumor cells by redirecting the signals through
other pathways. fourth, tumor cells can become
resistant to tkis, mostly due to new mutations in the

 xxxg2198xxx , drug eﬄux mechanisms, receptor
down-regulation, and loss of tk-inhibitory pathways.
however, tkis do have numerous good qualities.
first, in many tumor types, they tend to stabilize
tumor progression and may create a chronic disease
state which is no longer immediately life threatening.
second, side eﬀects are minimal when compared to
conventional chemotherapeutic agents. third, synergistic eﬀects are seen in vitro when tkis are combined with radiotherapy and/or conventional
chemotherapeutic agents.113–117 if studies in vivo
conﬁrm these results, one should consider studying
the effects of reducing chemotherapy dose, which
might lead to fewer side effects with equal efﬁcacy.
one of the mechanisms of synergy between these
drugs and chemotherapy is the increase of drug uptake due to decrease of interstitial ﬂuid pressure by
pdgf inhibition.1–3
the tkis that are currently registered or in advanced stages of clinical development are shown in
table 1.

future directions
the identiﬁcation of patients who are likely to
beneﬁt from inhibition of speciﬁc tyrosine kinases will
become highly important. an important issue is the
high costs of small molecule  xxxg2198xxx  inhibitors, up to $30,000 per patient per year.1 patients
should be selected based on genetics of their cancer
cells, as is proven to be effective in nsclc patients,
where only patients with a mutation in the egfr
receptor showed a favorable response to geﬁtinib.
alterations should be made to the conventional
phases of drug-development. maximum tolerated

dose (mtd) can no longer be the only end-point in
phase i studies, since tkis have limited side eﬀects
and mtd might never be reached. instead, phase i
studies should aim at identifying the maximum biological active dose, i.e. the dose that creates the
maximum target inhibition. in phase iii studies,
selection of the study population should be made
based on biogenetics of the tumor, and investigations
should also include pharmacodynamic analysis of
target inhibition. in previous large phase iii trials in
unselected patients, tkis were incorrectly judged to
be ineﬀective, and research of an eﬀective drug has
incorrectly been stopped. instead of response rate,
other endpoints should be chosen, like time to progression, while with  xxxg2198xxx  inhibitors it
might take some time before stabilization of the disease occurs.
most small molecule  xxxg2198xxx  inhibitors lack
substantial beneﬁt when given as monotherapy.
therefore combination therapies based on synergy,
combining multiple small molecule tkis (like geﬁtinib and sunitinib in rcc trials), combining a small
molecule tki with an antibody tki (like  xxxd2029xxx 
and bevacuzimab in crc trials, and lapatinib and
trastuzumab in breast cancer trials), or combining a
tki with conventional chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy are more likely to be eﬀective.
in the near future, preclinical studies will hopefully be able to identify more activated tyrosine
kinases, as overexpression of a target is not a
guarantee for treatment success. molecular markers
for toxicity, response and survival, such as the various mutations in gists are needed. future treatment regiments are likely to include multiple
 xxxg2198xxx  inhibitors, based on biogenetics of
the tumor cells, in combination with chemotherapy,
radiotherapy, and other anticancer agents. hopefully, this will improve the prognosis of patients
with several solid tumors by giving a complete or
partial tumor response or by creating a chronic
stable state in which the disease is no longer
immediately life threatening.
