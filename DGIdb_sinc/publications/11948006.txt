abstract
purpose: this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of topiramate (tpm) in patients with severe myoclonic
epilepsy in infancy ( xxxg2020xxx ) and refractory seizures. methods: we performed a prospective multicentric open label
add-on study in 18 patients (age 2–21 years, mean 9 years) with  xxxg2020xxx  and refractory seizures of different types. tpm
was added to one or two other baseline drugs and the efficacy was rated according to seizure type and frequency.
results: tpm was initiated at a daily dose of 0.5–1 mg/kg, followed by a 2-week titration at increments of 1 – 3
mg/kg/24 h up to a maximum daily dose of 12 mg/kg. after a mean period of 11.9 months (range 2 – 24 months),
three patients (16.7%) had 100% fewer seizures and ten patients (55.5%) had a more than 50% seizure decrease. in no
patient there was a seizure worsening. mild to moderate adverse events were present in four patients (22.2%),
represented by weight loss, hypermenorrhoea, renal microlithiasis, nervousness and dysarthric speech. conclusion:
tpm may be a useful drug in patients with  xxxg2020xxx , being particularly effective against generalized tonic– clonic
seizures. further studies are needed to evaluate the early use of this drug in such a severe syndrome. © 2002

gaba-induced influx of chloride, reducing corrents of l-type, high voltage activated-calcium
channels and by inhibiting kainate/ampa glutamate receptors. probably due to such a broad
spectrum of action, tpm has been shown to be

effective in children with generalized or partial
refractory seizures (elterman et al., 1999; dooley
et al., 1999; uldall and buchholt, 1999; glauser,
2000; mohamed et al., 2000; yeung et al., 2000;
coppola et al., 2001), in lennox– gastaut syndrome (sachdeo et al., 1999), as well as in refractory infantile spasms (glauser et al., 1998).
recently, nieto-barrera et al. (2000) reported a
more than 50% seizure reduction in about 70% of
their patients with severe myoclonic epilepsy during infancy.
here we report the short and middle term
efficacy and safety of tpm as add-on drug in a
multicentric series of refractory patients with
severe myoclonic epilepsy in infancy ( xxxg2020xxx ).

2. methods
the study group was composed of 18 out patients (nine males, nine females), aged between 2
and 21 years (mean: 9 years), all affected by
 xxxg2020xxx . the patients were recruited from six italian centers for children and adolescents’ epilepsy
care. they were selected according to the following criteria: (i) age 12 months and over; (ii)
seizures refractory to antiepileptic drugs; (iii) at
least four seizures a month during the 3 months
before tpm was administered; (iv) use of at least
one other aed, but no more than two; (v) absence of systemic or progressive neurologic diseases; and (vi) informed consent by parents
and/or caregivers to participate in the study. the
institutional review board from each epilepsy unit
approved the study and no pharmaceutical support was provided.
pseudoseizures were excluded by means of
video-eegs and/or long-term monitoring eegs.
ct/mri scans were performed in all cases. the
number of seizures was recorded by parents and
care-givers both at home and at school. seizure
frequency, type and duration were recorded in an
epilepsy diary. seizures were classified according
to the international league against epilepsy
(ilae) classification of epileptic seizures (ilae
commission, 1981) and  xxxg2020xxx  was diagnosed according to dravet et al.’s criteria (1984).

after a baseline observation period of 3 months
during which drug changes were not allowed,
tpm was initiated at the daily dose of 0.5– 1
mg/kg, followed by a 2-week titration at increments of 1– 3 mg/kg/24 h, up to a maximum daily
dose of 12 mg/kg, unless the patient was unable to
tolerate it. in the presence of any adverse event in
a given patient, the titration phase could be prolonged according to the clinical conditions. eeg,
side-effects, body weight and blood levels of concomitant aed were monitored in all patients
every month. cognitive and behavioral assessment was performed by means of a questionnaire
from parents or caregivers. the response to treatment was rated as follows: seizure control (100%
seizure remission); decrease in seizure rate by
50– 98% (very good) and less than 50% with minimal change in seizure severity (minimal); unmodified or worsened when seizure frequency and
severity were the same or increased as compared
to baseline period, respectively.
before tpm was administered, two patients
were taking one aed (11.1%), and 13 (72.2%)
two aed. three patients were on three aed
(16.7%), but when tpm was introduced, one of
them was tapered off. patients were taking the
following aed:  xxxd3485xxx  (14);  xxxd1718xxx  (4);
 xxxd2908xxx  (7); nitrazepam (2); clonazepam
(2); carbamazepine (1);  xxxd2090xxx  (3); acetazolamide (1); lamotrigine (1), gabapentin (1). if adverse side-effects occurred such as somnolence or
excessive sedation, one of the baseline aed could
be partially decreased even to the point of total
withdrawal; if adverse events persisted, the tpm
daily dose could be lowered according to the tips
for an optimal use of tpm as reported by
glauser (2000).
the mean age at onset of epilepsy was 5.6
months (range: 2–10 months). neurological examination at the time of entry revealed abnormalities in five patients (33.3%): mild to moderate
generalized hypotonia in eight, associated with
ataxia in one.
ct/mri scans showed a mild atrophy in three
patients; normal findings were present in all other
cases. mental retardation was present in 15 patients (83.3%): mild to moderate in 12, severe in
three. three other children aged less than 3 years

g. coppola et al. / epilepsy research 49 (2002) 45–48

showed a mild to moderate developmental delay.
seizure frequency before tpm was started was
the following: \4/month (7); \12/month (7);
\ 120/month (4). eeg recordings during baseline
period were generally obtained during wakeness
in most of our patients: they showed a slow
background activity in all patients associated with
diffuse theta waves in 10, localized or multiple
sharp or spike-wave discharges in six, and generalized spike-wave discharges in two patients. an
eeg improvement was defined as any significant
reduction in generalized or localized spike and
wave discharges and/or a decrease of the photoparoxysmal response.
statistical analysis was performed by means of
rank sum test for non parametric data and by
fisher’s exact test.

3. results
the 18 patients were treated with tpm for a
mean period of 11.9 months (range 2– 24 months).
the mean tpm dose at follow-up was 5.4 mg/kg/
24 h (range 2.8–10 mg/kg).

3.1. efficacy
three patients (16.7%) had 100% fewer seizures,
six patients (33.3%) had about 75% decline in
seizures and four (22.2%) a 50% seizure decrease;
seizure frequency was unchanged in five (27.8%);
in none of them there was a seizure worsening.
response rate by seizure type is shown in fig.
1. response to tpm was  xxxd102xxx  in generalized tonic– clonic seizures as compared with complex partial and myoclonic ones. accordingly,
total number of generalized tonic– clonic seizures
was significantly decreased as compared to baseline period (224 vs 111; p = b0.0001; rank sum
test). eeg findings during treatment with tpm
were substantially unchanged in 15 patients,
slightly improved in one and worsened in another.
in one case photoparoxysmal response was clearly
decreased. there was no relationship between response to tpm and age at therapy onset, sex,
number of previous antiepileptic drugs and eeg
changes during tpm therapy.

3.2. tolerability
adverse events during treatment were present
in four patients (22.2%). they were represented by
mild weight loss (b 5% of baseline body weight)
and hypermenorrhoea (1), renal microlithiasis (1),
hyporexia and nervousness (1), transient
dysarthric speech (1). they appeared usually during the first weeks of treatment and never caused
themselves drug withdrawal.

4. discussion
in our series, tpm was effective in about 72.2%
of patients and the overall response was substantially in agreement with the few data reported in
literature (10% seizure-free and 60% with more
than 50% reduction in seizure frequency by
burkart et al. (1999); 16.6 and 55%, respectively,
by nieto-barrera et al. (2000)).
as for seizure type, tpm resulted significantly
more effective in generalized tonic–clonic seizures
as compared with complex partial and myoclonic
seizures; conversely, nieto-barrera et al. (2000)
reported a slightly better response in partial than
in generalized seizures. it is noteworthy that
about 70% of their patients with cgts showed a
50% or more decline in seizure frequency.
as for dose-range of tpm maximal efficacy, in
our patients it was 2.8–10 mg/kg/day (mean dose
5.4 mg). it can be stressed that the dose-range of
maximal efficacy in patients with  xxxg2020xxx  doesn’t

substantially differ from that reported for partial
or generalized seizures (moreland et al., 1999;
elterman et al., 1999; wheless, 2000; coppola et
al., 2001).
as for adverse reactions, tpm was a well tolerated add-on therapy, never causing drug withdrawal in any patient. effects on liver, renal and
haematologic function were unremarkable. in our
series a mild and transient hyporexia recurred in
two patients: in one it was associated with hypermenorrhoea, in another it was selective for milk
and associated with a transient nervousness. as
for the renal microlithiasis, it appeared in one
patient after 4 weeks of treatment at a daily dose
of 2.8 mg/kg and did not further recur with
increasing amounts of daily oral liquids.
in conclusion, this prospective study suggests
that tpm may be a useful drug in patients with
 xxxg2020xxx ; parents and/or caregivers found it particularly effective against tonic– clonic or secondary
generalized seizures. the efficacy of tpm seemed
to persist over time, just like in other types of
epilepsy. further studies are needed as well to
evaluate the early use of this drug in such a severe
epilepsy syndrome.
