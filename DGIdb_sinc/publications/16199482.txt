cardiovascular physiology is profoundly regulated by multiple endocrine signals via nuclear and cell surface receptors,
and age-related hormonal decline may increase the risk of
cardiovascular disease (1). current controversy regarding cardiovascular effects of hormone therapy (35, 38) emphasizes the
need for research to enhance our understanding of steroid
hormone actions on structural and functional changes in the
blood vessel wall (7). growing evidence suggests a role for
estrogen receptors (er) in regulation of vascular healing and
proliferation following injury as well as er-mediated regulation of endothelial-dependent vasodilator reactivity responses

(23). however, published data on er-mediated effects on
coronary vasoconstrictor reactivity responses are sparse.
despite a large body of evidence on the biological actions of
17␤-estradiol (e2) (33), there is a paucity of information on the
biological actions of metabolites of e2, such as the endogenous
er ligand estriol (e3), which can be present at significant
concentrations at the tissue level (5, 11, 19). e3 is abundantly
produced during late-stage pregnancy and, thus, is present in
 xxxd2044xxx  preparations, which are known to
relieve menopausal symptoms (43), has antiatherosclerotic
actions, improves endothelial and bone function (15), and
ameliorates symptoms in autoimmune demyelinating disorders
such as multiple sclerosis (21). optimal homeostatic regulation
of vascular tone and response to injury and inflammation may
require a balance of multiple estrogenic metabolites in the
vascular wall. for example, accruing evidence supports the
concept of regulation of vascular proliferation by an array of
steroid metabolites (4, 5). however, there has been little or no
investigation of effects of metabolite er ligands on the regulation of vascular reactivity.
our previous research showed that e2 and progesterone
protect surgically menopausal rhesus macaque monkeys (rm)
from in vivo coronary hyperreactivity (ch) and attenuate
persistent ca2⫹ signals (27, 28). in this study, experiments
were designed to investigate the effects of e3 on regulation of
in vivo ch. furthermore, we tested effects of e3 and 5␣androstane-3␤,17␤-diol (3␤-adiol), a dihydrotestosterone
(dht) metabolite with er-␤ agonist activity (45), on ca2⫹
signals in coronary vascular muscle cells (vmc) and, for
comparison, examined the effects of the reported pharmacologically selective er-␤ ligands diarylpropionitrile (dpn) (40)
and genistein (36) on ca2⫹ signals in coronary vmc. in
addition, using immunocytochemistry and western blotting,
we examined the association of regulation of thromboxaneprostanoid receptor (tpr) expression with vmc reactivity.

september 30, 2005; doi:10.1152/ajpheart.00468.2005.—previous reports showed that 17␤-estradiol implants attenuate in vivo coronary
hyperreactivity (ch), characterized by long-duration vasoconstrictions
(in coronary angiographic experiments), in menopausal rhesus monkeys.
prolonged ca2⫹ contraction signals that correspond with ch in coronary
vascular muscle cells (vmc) to the same dual-constrictor stimulus,
serotonin ⫹ the thromboxane analog u-46619, in estrogen-deprived
vmc were suppressed by ⬎72 h in 17␤-estradiol. the purpose of this
study was to test whether an endogenous estrogen metabolite with
 xxxg730xxx -␤ (er-␤) binding activity, estriol (e3), suppresses in
vivo and in vitro ch. e3 treatment in vivo for 4 wk significantly
attenuated the angiographically evaluated vasoconstrictor response to
intracoronary serotonin ⫹ u-46619 challenge. in vitro treatment of
rhesus coronary vmc for ⬎72 h with nanomolar e3 attenuated late ca2⫹
signals. this reduction of late ca2⫹ signals also appeared after ⬎72 h of
treatment with subnanomolar 5␣-androstane-3␤,17␤-diol (3␤-adiol), an
endogenous dihydrotestosterone metabolite with er-␤ binding activity.
r,r-tetrahydrochrysene, a selective er-␤ antagonist, significantly
blocked the e3- and 3␤-adiol-mediated attenuation of late ca2⫹ signal
increases. er-␤ and thromboxane-prostanoid receptor (tpr) were coexpressed in coronary arteries and aorta. in vivo e3 treatment attenuated
aortic tpr expression. furthermore, in vitro treatment with e3 or 3␤adiol downregulated tpr expression in vmc, which was blocked for
both agonists by pretreatment with r,r-tetrahydrochrysene. e3- and
3␤-adiol-mediated reduction in persistent ca2⫹ signals is associated with
er-␤-mediated attenuation of tpr expression and may partly explain
estrogen benefits in coronary vascular muscle.

of s ⫹ u pulse stimulation were determined as described previously
(17, 27–29) after ⬎72 h of in vitro exposure to er-␤ ligand (or
placebo). when selective er-␤ antagonist treatment (e.g., r,r-thc)
was also performed, the antagonist was added to vmc culture plates
3 h before subsequent treatment with the agonist (and continued
during the entire agonist treatment). reactivity effects of chronic (72
h) in vitro treatment with e3, 3␤-adiol, genistein, and dpn, alone or
in the presence of r,r-thc, were examined by vmc ca2⫹ signal
amplitude over 30 min. the vmc ca2⫹ was determined as percent
change in fluo 3 fluorescence from baseline in response to 15 s of
stimulation with 10 ␮m s ⫹ 100 nm u. the statistically determined
end point was the late (30 min) rise in ca2⫹ fluo 3 fluorescence,
expressed as percent change (27, 28). vmc cultures from three or
more separate rm were intrinsic to each resulting data point.
immunocytochemistry. immunocytochemistry was performed by
an adaptation of the indirect immunofluorescence method of yu et al.
(49), as reported previously (17, 29). ovx rm coronary arteries were
dissected, fixed, and prepared as serial sections for receptor localization. coronary and aorta cross sections were prepared using a leica
cryomicrotome. er-␤ labeling was performed with a mouse monoclonal anti-human er-␤ antibody (cfk-e12) (3). tpr labeling was
performed with a custom-prepared polyclonal chicken antibody targeted against the ligand binding domain of tpr (aves labs, tigard,
or) based on the reported amino acid sequence for this domain (cfl
tlg aes gd) (17, 44) or with a rabbit polyclonal antibody ( xxxg1653xxx ;

(28). controls were included for all immunocytochemical studies
(neutralizing antigen peptide or omission of primary antibody) to
ascertain the specificity of each antibody. at least four coverslips from
each treatment and control group were examined, and images were
recorded using a zeiss axiovert meta confocal microscope (courtesy
of dr. john welsh, neurological sciences institute, oregon health
and science university) or a nikon confocal microscope with a
radiance 2100 system (courtesy of bio-rad and dr. robert summers,
salk institute, san diego, ca). imaging was performed in nonconfocal studies with a c-apochromat ⫻40/1.2 na water-immersion objective on an axiovert 200m microscope using a hamamatsu electron
bombardment charge coupled device camera and compix simple pci
software. captured analog images were converted to digital images
and digitally stored on an intel pentium or amd athlon computer
hard disk and a dvd disk to allow security, redundant backups, and
offline analysis of differences in expression of receptors as measured
by intensities under matched conditions.
western blots. western blots were performed as described previously (17). primary cultures of vmc grown to confluence in 100 ⫻
20 mm falcon tissue culture dishes were treated with agonists for
72 h. if selective er-␤ antagonist treatment (e.g., r,r-thc) was
performed, the antagonist was added to the cell culture plates for 3 h
before addition of the agonist, and antagonist treatment continued
during the agonist treatment. parallel time-matched untreated vmc
served as controls.

cream made to good laboratory practice specifications was provided
by dimera. e3 and 3␤-adiol were purchased from steraloids (newport, ri), dpn and genistein from tocris chemicals (ellisville, mo),
fluo 3 from molecular probes (eugene, or), and secondary antibodies
from jackson immunolabs (westgrove, pa). r,r-thc was provided

anticipated transdermal systemic absorption (7%) was ⬃0.2 mg.
trained personnel used a squeeze-box cage for application of the drug
through a window in the cage especially designed to allow optimal
application with minimal animal discomfort. the cream covered an
⬃6-cm2 area on the shaved subscapular area on the back of the trained
rm without need for anesthetic or tranquilizer. this subscapular area,
which is inaccessible for licking and minimally noticed by the rm,
was used for subdermal or transdermal dosing for optimum steroid
hormone delivery as reported previously (17).
angiography data from 6 ovx historical control rm (untreated
ovx; 12.4 ⫾ 0.8 yr old, 6.1 ⫾ 0.5 kg body wt), performed in the same
laboratory, with use of the same protocol, and by the same investigators, were also included in the study analysis for comparison of the
in vivo protective effects of e3 with ch. these controls were
considered appropriate, because no specific effect of the vehicle in a
placebo cream was anticipated on the basis of previous demonstration
of no treatment effect of placebo with the identical formulation
(without the active pharmaceutical ingredient) applied following
the same primate center protocol with the same special window
cages (17). experimental protocols were approved by the oregon
regional primate research center animal care and use committee.
provocation of constriction to test for ch. rm were subjected to
the coronary artery combined vasoconstrictor stimulus in a catheterization laboratory protocol described previously (16, 17, 26, 28, 29,
31). briefly, the stepwise injection protocol tests the ability of slow (1
ml over 30 s) intracoronary infusion of vasoactive endogenous substances, 100 ␮m serotonin (s) and 1 ␮m u-46619 (u, a thromboxane
analog), to initiate the prolonged (⬎5 min), severe (to ⬍33% of
control diameter) vasoconstriction that defines ch producing ischemia and, if unrelieved, myocardial infarction. acetylcholine-induced
vasodilation of 5– 8% was found in all e3-treated rm, indicating
normal endothelial dilator function. an observer blinded to the treatment groups measured coronary artery diameters (⌽) from serial
angiograms to define the points of minimum ⌽ after each injection
(16, 17, 26, 28, 29, 31). the corresponding anatomic point on the
control image was the 100% reference ⌽. average minimum ⌽ of
major epicardial coronary arteries were digitally analyzed to determine minimum ⌽. a reduction in ⌽ to ⬍33% of control for ⬎5 min
was classified as ch, whether or not focal vasospasm was observed
(16, 17, 26, 28, 29, 31).
fluorescence polarization er-␤ coactivator assay. fluorescence
polarization er-␤ coactivator assay (35) was performed according to
the manufacturers’ published protocol (panvera discovery screening,
madison, wi; invitrogen, carlsbad ca) to test er-␤ agonist/antagonist activity of 3␤-adiol, dpn, genistein, e3, or r,r-tetrahydrochrysene (r,r-thc) studied individually using the er-␤ coactivator
assay along with reference agonists and antagonists. in the er-␤
coactivator assay, recombinant human er-␤ and a fluorescent er
ligand are used to determine the er-␤ agonist/antagonist activity of
test compounds. the indicator d22 is a peptide containing an lxxll
motif and flanking sequences that resemble known nuclear receptor
coactivators. agonist-bound er-␤ promotes d22 binding, resulting in
a larger fraction of bound d22 and measurable increases in polarization value, whereas antagonist-bound er-␤ represses d22 binding,
yielding a larger fraction of unbound d22 and a measurably lower
polarization value. polarization of fluorescence signals was measured
in 96-well microplates using a tecan ultra instrument (research
triangle park, nc). the concentration of ligand that resulted in
half-maximum increase (agonist) or decrease (antagonist) in polarization by sigmoidal b spline curve fit to a dose-response curve (origin)
was taken as the ec50 or ic50 for the er-␤-d22 interaction.
vascular muscle culture and vmc reactivity. coronary vmc used
in cell culture live cell fluorescent, immunocytochemistry, and western blot studies were obtained from a separate group of 12 ovx rm
through the tissue distribution program at the oregon national primate research center. coronary vmc culture protocols were performed as described previously (27–29). vmc ca2⫹ responses to 15 s

for live cell fluorescence experiments, comparisons were made between ca2⫹ signals in ovx rm coronary control (untreated) vmc
and vmc treated with the er-␤ agonists e3, 3␤-adiol, dpn, or
genistein, alone or in the presence of the selective er-␤ antagonist
r,r-thc.

e3 reduces in vivo ch. angiography data showed that e3
treatment effectively reduced s ⫹ u-provoked persistent vasoconstriction compared with controls (fig. 1a, e3-treated ovx
rm vs. untreated ovx rm). the hyperreactivity in one untreated ovx rm manifested in the form of a vasospasm (arrow
in fig. 1a), i.e., a severe segmental vasoconstriction to 10% of
control ⌽ that persisted for ⬎5 min. as a group, untreated ovx
rm exhibited severe vasoconstriction (⬍33% for 5–15 min,
⌽ ⫽ 25 ⫾ 3.66% of control; fig. 1b), meeting our criterion for
ch. in sharp contrast, e3 treatment resulted in reduced and
only transient vasoconstriction in every case. the minimum
(constricted) epicardial coronary artery ⌽ exceeded 50% of the
prestimulus ⌽ for the e3 group (⌽ ⫽ 63.87 ⫾ 3.5% of control;
fig. 1b). all six e3-treated rm showed no ch (by the criterion
of ⬍33% of control ⌽ for ⬎5 min) and completed the entire
multiple-challenge protocol without developing severe, persistent constriction.
er-␤ agonist activity of 3␤-adiol, genistein, dpn, and e3.
fluorescence polarization analysis performed in a simultaneous series with ici-187780, tamoxifen, and 4- xxxd91xxx  as positive controls demonstrated that, according to
changes in rotation of polarized light as effected by ligand-toreceptor binding, 3␤-adiol, e3, dpn, and genistein act as
er-␤ agonists, whereas r,r-thc acts as an er-␤ antagonist
(fig. 2). specific ec50 values (nm) for the agonists were as
follows: 10 for e2, 17 for e3, 23 for 3␤-adiol, 15 for dpn, and
20 for genistein. ic50 values (nm) for antagonists were as
follows: 47 for  xxxd2165xxx  ( xxxd2165xxx ), 97 for tamoxifen, 79 for
4- xxxd91xxx , and 38 for r,r-thc.
e3 and 3␤-adiol attenuate late intracellular ca2⫹ signals.
the remarkably potent effect of e3 on reducing the duration
and extent of provoked vasoconstriction in primate coronary
angiographic studies, the documented affinity of 3␤-adiol for
er-␤ in rat prostate (45), and independent confirmation of
er-␤ agonist activity of e3 and 3␤-adiol in the abovementioned er-␤ coactivator fluorescence polarization assay
prompted us to explore vmc effects of these endogenous
metabolite er ligands (in comparison with the more familiar
pharmacological er-␤-selective probe genistein) on fluorescent intracellular ca2⫹. the physiological range of circulating
3␤-adiol concentration is 100 – 800 pm in healthy women and
men (12). we therefore tested effects of near-physiological
3␤-adiol concentrations.
treatment with 1 nm e3 or 0.3 nm in vitro for 72 h
significantly reduced persistent (⬎30 min after the stimulus)
ca2⫹ signals (fig. 3a). vmc stimulation after 0.3–3 nm
3␤-adiol resulted in significantly decreased late ca2⫹ signals
compared with controls. however, 0.03 nm 3␤-adiol was
ineffective in preventing late ca2⫹ signal increases (fig. 3b)
and, thus, defined the foot of the 3␤-adiol dose-response
curve. the low-physiological-range 72-h treatment with 0.3
nm 3␤-adiol was as effective as 1 nm 3␤-adiol in decreasing

there were no significant differences among e3, 3␤-adiol, and
dpn in ability to significantly attenuate the late ca2⫹ signals.
dpn (1 nm) and genistein (10 nm) concentrations were based
on previously reported er-␤ agonist ec50 values (25).
in addition, 3␤-adiol not only significantly reduced the late
ca2⫹ increase but also reduced early ca2⫹ signals (fig. 3c).
because such reductions in intracellular ca2⫹ could hypothetically occur as direct (nongenomic) actions of 3␤-adiol on
vmc, we also tested short-term incubations (5– 60 min) with
3␤-adiol. there was no significant reduction in vmc ca2⫹

discussion

this study is the first demonstration of a coronary protective
effect of low-dose transdermal e3 in a surgically menopausal
primate model, as evidenced by the reduction of in vivo ch.
reduction of ch by e3 treatment was, in fact, equivalent to
reduction of ch in previous studies in which primates were
treated for 2– 4 wk with e2 subdermal implants with plasma e2
levels of 60 pg/ml (26, 27, 31). although gc-ms demonstrated that serum estrogen metabolites in the e3-treated rm
remained at ovx levels (data not shown) and, despite a short
half-life (due to a single pass through the liver) with rapid
glucuronide or sulfate conjugation and subsequent rapid renal
excretion, application of transdermal low-dose e3 for 4 wk
significantly reduced ch.
whereas the literature is replete with evidence (animal and
human data) supporting beneficial cardiovascular effects of e2,
few studies have examined e3 actions on cardiovascular pathophysiology. in a spontaneously hypertensive stroke-prone rat
model of moderate renal dysfunction, e3 treatment significantly reduced cardiac lesions (10). in humans, e3 augments
the beneficial effect of pravastatin in retarding the progression

3␤-adiol (data not shown).
r,r-thc blocked e3, 3␤-adiol, and dpn reduction of late
ca2⫹ signals. pretreatment with a selective er-␤ antagonist,
r,r-thc (30 ␮m), significantly blocked the effects of e3,
3␤-adiol, and dpn in reducing the persistent elevations in
ca2⫹ (fig. 3d). incubation of vmc with 30 ␮m r,r-thc
alone for 1– 6 h had no significant effect on late ca2⫹ signals.
the r,r-thc concentration was chosen on the basis of the
molar ratios for selective er-␤ blockage by r,r-thc in
transactivation assays (24, 41).
er-␤ and tpr are expressed in rm coronary arteries and
vmc. double-labeling immunocytochemistry studies employing indirect immunofluorescence showed er-␤ and tpr coexpression in primate coronary arteries and aorta (fig. 4a).
tpr expression in aorta from e3-treated rm was dramatically
attenuated compared with control rm (fig. 4b). in addition,
er-␤ and tpr were coexpressed in immunocytochemistry
studies of coronary vmc, with a tendency for suppression of
tpr in the e3- or 3␤-adiol-treated groups (fig. 4c). in
primary coronary vmc lysates, er-␤ was detected as a 52kda protein band with use of mouse monoclonal er-␤ antibody (fig. 5a).
e3 and 3␤-adiol attenuated tpr expression in vmc, which
is blocked by r,r-thc. although immunocytochemistry results only qualitatively implied decreased tpr expression by
3␤-adiol and e3 (fig. 4c), western blotting demonstrated the
quantitative reduction of tpr by 3␤-adiol or e3 (fig. 5, b and
c). studies of the effects of the other er-␤ ligands, with or
without r,r-thc, on tpr expression showed that in vitro
treatment with dpn or genistein also significantly decreased
tpr. there were no significant differences among the effects
of er-␤ agonists in attenuating tpr. although r,r-thc
alone did not significantly change tpr expression (data not
shown), r,r-thc pretreatment significantly blocked the reduction of tpr by e3 or 3␤-adiol (fig. 5, b and c). similarly,
r,r-thc significantly blocked the reduction of tpr by
genistein or dpn (fig. 5, b and c).

formation of e3 from e2 may allow continued stimulation of

antagonist r,r-thc) point to a possible contribution of er-␤
to the in vitro reduction of late ca2⫹ signals by these endogenous metabolites.
ch is hypothesized to involve tpr upregulation, which has
been documented in ovarian steroid-deficient states (17, 28,
29). because e3 and 3␤-adiol independently attenuated the
persistent ca2⫹ signals, we reasoned that er-␤-mediated
downregulation of tpr expression and signaling may contribute to the reduction in late ca2⫹ signals. attenuation of tpr
expression in the aorta by in vivo e3 treatment was corroborated by evidence demonstrating attenuated tpr expression in
ajp-heart circ physiol • vol

vmc after in vitro er-␤ agonist treatment. specificity shown
by in vitro r,r-thc-antagonizing effects against e3 or 3␤adiol (which, unless they were blocked, would reduce late
ca2⫹ signals and attenuate tpr expression) suggests that
er-␤ may suppress tpr expression and associated downstream persistent ca2⫹ signaling. to our knowledge, these data
provide the first evidence that downregulation of tpr expression, including an obligatory contribution of er-␤ that results
in decreased late ca2⫹ signals in coronary vascular muscle,
may significantly alleviate or prevent ch. suppression of
tpr-mediated exaggerated, persistent vmc ca2⫹ signals

would therefore appear to offer a cellular mechanism for
physiological suppression of ch.
although pharmacological data from the present study suggest a role for er-␤ in reducing the late intracellular ca2⫹
signals and in attenuating tpr expression in coronary vmc,
an acknowledged limitation of this study is that we have not
examined the specific contribution of er-␣ to regulation of the
abnormal late ca2⫹ signals and tpr expression. therefore, we
cannot rule out a significant contribution of er-␣ in suppressing tpr expression and diminishing the late ca2⫹ signals.
nonetheless, the r,r-thc (a selective er-␤ antagonist) evidence suggests that er-␤ stimulation is a major contributor.
moreover, because er-␤ is the dominant isoform of er
expressed in vascular muscle (18), its role in regulation of
vascular reactivity warrants evaluation. relative contributions
of the roles of er-␣ and er-␤ in ch regulation will depend on
clarification in future studies as more selective er agonists and
antagonists become available.
increased late ca2⫹ signals, in the presence of pharmacological er-␤ blockade with r,r-thc observed in this study,
appear to be an important cellular mechanistic extension of the
concept of enhanced vasoconstrictor sensitivity reported in
er-␤-knockout (ko) mice (50). ko studies showed that er-␣
stimulation in the absence of er-␤ resulted in hypertension in
the er-␤-ko mice, which was hypothesized to be due to
increased sensitivity to vasoconstrictors in female and male
mice (50). an unexplored question is whether regulation of
ajp-heart circ physiol • vol

sensitivity to vasoconstrictors is mediated specifically by er␣-er-␤ heterodimers or, rather, as a balance of dual actions
mediated by er-␣ and er-␤. because binding of ligands to a
particular er subtype and the resulting balance of er-␣ and
er-␤ actions in a tissue are clearly species dependent (14),
there is a potential pitfall in a global interpretation of primate
and mouse steroid receptor data. because of uncertainties
inherent in ko approaches and steroid receptor phenomena
that are uniquely primate, predictions of human er actions
should rely on primate data when differences from mouse or
other nonprimate studies are reported (14).
we previously demonstrated the presence of er-␣ (25) and
tpr (17, 28, 29) in rm aorta and coronary arteries. although
the predominant er expressed in human vmc has been shown
to be er-␤ (18) and mrna expression for er-␣ and er-␤ has
been previously demonstrated in primate coronary artery and
aorta (37), in this study we demonstrate, for the first time,
er-␤ protein expression in rm aorta, coronary arteries, and
coronary vmc (isolated cells). expression of two forms of er
in the blood vessel wall requires consideration of the possibility that er-␣ and er-␤ separately or cooperatively, with
synergistic or opposing molecular actions, regulate reactivity
(and probably also proliferation) in vmc and endothelial cells.
er-␤ has been implicated in the vmc antiproliferative effects
of e2 during the repair response to vascular injury in both
genders (20). in contrast, e2-mediated reendothelialization (46)
is promoted by er-␣ (2). this dichotomy of e2 effects be-

tween endothelium and vascular muscle would be consistent
with the hypothesis that er-␣ predominates in the endothelium
but er-␤ predominates in vascular muscle. recent data suggest that e2 contributes to the vascular healing process and that
restenosis is prevented by promoting reendothelialization via
er-␣ activation (9). there may be a concomitant decrease in
vmc migration and proliferation via er-␤ actions that allows
for repair without occlusion (9). er-␤ may also mediate
gender differences in ischemia-reperfusion injury, inasmuch as
er-␤-ko female mice display significantly less functional
recovery (and more necrosis) than wild-type female (or male)
control mice; thus er-␤ may have a greater cardioprotective
role in females (8).
 xxxg1884xxx  (cox-2) is the dominant source of prostaglandins, which mediate pain and inflammation, and also
biosynthesis of the cardiovascular protective substance prostacyclin, a short-lived autacoid that is normally continuously
synthesized in the blood vessel wall (32). the central role of
cox-2 in the beneficial effects of estrogens has been recently
recognized, with the implication that cox-2 inhibition might
remove beneficial protection, particularly in women (6). in
view of recent adverse outcomes with cox-2 inhibitors, the
hypothesis that cox-2 inhibition may unbalance estrogen
benefits is a concept that should be carefully examined.
the reduction of intracellular ca2⫹ by 3␤-adiol (an androgen metabolite), which implies beneficial coronary vascular
effects, is counterintuitive to reported potentially deleterious
effects of androgens on ch (27). however, cardiovascular
actions of androgens are conflicting and poorly understood (22,
47). the 3␤-adiol (a direct dht metabolite) data, showing
reduction of persistent ca2⫹ signals, virtually mirror e3 in vitro
data, which correlate strongly with e3 in vivo data to implicate
reduction of ch as a salutary er-␤ agonist effect on coronary
artery function. we speculate that such an er-␤-mediated
action of androgen metabolites, e.g., 3␤-adiol, may counterbalance potentially adverse coronary vascular actions of the
major active androgen dht, which is only one enzymatic step
away. this possibility warrants further exploration.
clinical outcomes of treatment with estrogens to achieve
cardiovascular protection against dysfunction may depend on
the state of blood vessels (whether diseased or relatively
normal), the duration of a deficiency, and the form of drug
delivery (type of estrogen, dose, and route of administration).
therefore, timing of the intervention, dose, and continuous
circadian release may be important in optimizing vascular
benefits and outcomes (13, 17, 38). future research to enhance
understanding of mechanisms of ch and its complex regulation by steroid receptor signal transduction pathways has the
promise of leading to the discovery of better coronary protective strategies focused on transcriptional origins of vascular
reactivity.
