abstract
recent information suggests that free radicals are closely involved in the pathogenesis andror progression of parkinson’s disease
žpd.. high-dose levodopa therapy has been suggested to increase oxidative stress, thereby accelerating the progression of pd. based on
this viewpoint, free radical scavenging, antioxidant and neuroprotective agents which may prevent the progression of pd have recently
attracted considerable attention. for example, ergot derivative dopamine žda. agonists have been reported to scavenge free radicals in
vitro and show a neuroprotective effect in vivo. non-ergot da agonists have also recently been used in the treatment of pd despite the
lack of substantial evidence for any free radical scavenging activity or antioxidant activity. the present study was conducted to assess the
in vitro free radical scavenging and antioxidant activities of  xxxd3145xxx , a non-ergot da agonist, as well as its glutathione žgsh., catalase
and superoxide dismutase žsod. activating effects and neuroprotective effect in vivo.  xxxd3145xxx  scavenges free radicals and suppresses
lipid peroxidation in vitro, but these activities are very weak, suggesting that the antioxidant effect of  xxxd3145xxx  observed in vitro may be
a minor component of its neuroprotective effect in vivo. administration of  xxxd3145xxx  for 7 days increased gsh, catalase and sod
activities in the striatum and protected striatal dopaminergic neurons against 6-hydroxydopamine ž6-ohda. in mice. pre-treatment with
sulpiride prevented  xxxd3145xxx  from enhancing striatal gsh, catalase and sod activities and abolished the protection of dopaminergic
neurons against 6-ohda. our findings indicate that activation of gsh, catalase and sod mediated via da d2 receptors may be the
principal mechanism of neuroprotection by  xxxd3145xxx . q 1999 elsevier science b.v. all rights reserved.

1. introduction
parkinson’s disease žpd. is characterized by progressive degeneration of dopaminergic ždaergic. neurons of
the nigrostriatal system and dopamine žda. replacement
therapy with levodopa is currently the gold standard for
symptomatic treatment for pd. although the introduction
of levodopa has markedly improved the prognosis of pd,
gradual progression of the disease occurs despite levodopa
therapy, resulting in severe impairment of quality of life
žqol. 10 years or more after the disease onset. furthermore, if high-dose levodopa therapy is continued for several years, the majority of patients begin to experience

various adverse reactions, including the wearing-off phenomenon, on–off phenomenon, dyskinesia and psychiatric
symptoms w8,12,27x.
various mechanisms have been implicated in the progression of pd. among them, the free radicalroxidative
stress hypothesis has been accepted as the most plausible
mechanism of disease progression w1,10,21,35x. high-dose
levodopa therapy has also been suggested to produce free
radicals and increase oxidative stress, and some experimental and clinical studies have suggested that treatment
with levodopa may accelerate the progression of pd
w1,9,14,18,45x, although direct evidence is lacking and the
subject is controversial w7,39x.
based on the free radical hypothesis for pd, and in
view of the complications associated with levodopa therapy, an alternative approach to treatment of this disorder

would be the use of antioxidant or neuroprotective therapy
to prevent or slow down pd progression w20,25,31x. among
possible neuroprotective agents, da agonists, particularly
of the ergot derivative, such as pergolide or bromocriptine,
are reported to have neuroprotective effects in experimental models w20,25,31x, and may prevent observable clinical
progression of the disease w16,19,26x. ergot derivatives
with daergic activity have been reported to scavenge free
radicals in vitro w15,17,28,34,42,44x and show a neuroprotective effect in vivo w4,24,34x. non-ergot da agonists
have also been recently used in the treatment of pd despite
a lack of substantial evidence of any free radical scavenging or antioxidant activity. the present study was conducted to assess the in vitro free radical scavenging activity and antioxidant activity of  xxxd3145xxx , a non-ergot da
agonist, and its in vivo neuroprotective properties.

3. results
3.1. in õitro free radical scaõenging actiõity of  xxxd3145xxx 
3.1.1. ho ø scaõenging actiõity
ho ø radicals produced by fenton’s reaction between
fe 2q and h 2 o 2 were trapped by dmpo and the dmpo–
ho ø adducts generated were quantified by esr spectrometry.  xxxd3145xxx  reduced the level of dmpo–ho ø
adducts in a concentration-dependent manner žfig. 1a..
 xxxd3145xxx  showed a clear scavenging effect at 80 mm
with an approximate ic 50 of 1.5 mm žfig. 1b..  xxxd3145xxx 
had a lower scavenging activity than the other two ergot
da agonists, pergolide and bromocriptine, and their ic 50
values were 300 mm and 150 mm, respectively ždata not

3.1.2. superoxide (o2øy ) scaõenging actiõity
superoxide radicals žo 2øy . produced in the xanthinerxod system were trapped by dmpo and the

3.1.3. no ø scaõenging actiõity
esr spectrometric analysis of noc-7 and carboxyl–
ptio was performed as described previously w28x. since
no ø generated from noc-7 is oxidized by carboxy–
ptio, which in turn is reduced to carboxy–pti, the observed carboxy–pti signal is indicative of the concentration of no ø . in this system,  xxxd3145xxx  reduced the level
of no ø radicals detected as carboxy–pti signal in a
concentration-dependent manner žfig. 2a.. however, the

56

m. iida et al.r brain research 838 (1999) 51–59

no ø scavenging activity of  xxxd3145xxx  was not very strong,
with an approximate ic 50 of 20 mm žfig. 2b.. in the same
system, however, the ic 50 values observed with pergolide
and bromocriptine were 30 mm and 200 mm, respectively
ždata not shown..

a high concentration of  xxxd3145xxx  ž25 mm. suppressed
auto-oxidation žfig. 3..

3.2. in õitro effects on auto-oxidation in mouse striatal
homogenates

at 1 h after the last of seven daily i.p. doses of 0.2 or 2
mgrkg of  xxxd3145xxx , the striatum was isolated from mice
and assayed for gsh, catalase and sod. striatal gsh
level was significantly increased by administration of both
0.2 and 2 mg kgy1 dayy1 , and the striatal catalase and
sod activities were significantly increased by administration of  xxxd3145xxx  at 2 mg kgy1 dayy1 žfig. 4..
although sulpiride, a da  xxxg656xxx  antagonist, alone
had produced a depletion or no change in gsh, catalase

determination of tbars was performed after incubation of the mouse striatal homogenate for 30 min at 378c
for peroxidant stimulation in the presence of  xxxd3145xxx .
 xxxd3145xxx  žat concentrations from 5 mm to 12.5 mm. did

and sod activities, pre-treatment with sulpiride 30 min
before each dose of  xxxd3145xxx  completely abolished the
promoting effect of daily  xxxd3145xxx  administration on striatal gsh, catalase and sod activities. this indicated that
the activation of striatal gsh, catalase and sod by repeated administration of  xxxd3145xxx  was mediated by its
daergic effect on da d2 receptors.
3.4. effect of daily administration of  xxxd3145xxx  on striatal
leõels of da and its metabolites
the mean levels of da and its metabolites ždopac
and hva. in the mouse striatum are shown in fig. 5.
 xxxd3145xxx  was administered i.p. at 0.2 or 2 mgrkg daily
for 7 days, with the last dose given 1 h before injection of
6-ohda. one week after i.c.v. injection of 6-ohda, the
striatum was isolated and assayed to determine levels of
da and metabolites. in mice treated with vehicle alone,
striatal da, dopac, and hva levels were markedly
reduced by 6-ohda compared with the vehicleq shamoperated group. in mice treated with  xxxd3145xxx  however,
striatal da, dopac, and hva levels showed a smaller
decrease after i.c.v. injection of 6-ohda. particularly, in
 xxxd3145xxx  ž2 mgrkg. q 6-ohda treated mice, the striatal
da level was significantly higher than in the vehicleq 6ohda group. in vehicleq 6-ohda mice, the striatal
ždopacq hva.rda ratio, a parameter of da turnover,
was significantly higher than in vehicleq sham-operated
mice, as has been reported in the brains of patients with
pd w29x. however, the da turnover was normalized completely by pre-treatment with  xxxd3145xxx . thus, pre-treatment with  xxxd3145xxx  prevented acceleration of striatal da
turnover induced by 6-ohda lesion.
sulpiride, a da  xxxg656xxx  antagonist, alone had no
effect on either depletion in striatal da, dopac and hva
levels or acceleration of the striatal da turnover induced
by an i.c.v. 6-ohda lesion. however, pre-treatment with
sulpiride 30 min before each dose of  xxxd3145xxx  cancelled
protective effect of  xxxd3145xxx  on da dopac and hva
levels, and da turnover after i.c.v. injection of 6-ohda,
similar to the changes observed in the vehicleq 6-ohda
group. thus, repeated sulpiride treatment before each
 xxxd3145xxx  injection abrogated the neuroprotective effect of
 xxxd3145xxx  against 6-ohda. this finding indicates that the
neuroprotective effect of  xxxd3145xxx  was mediated by da
d2 receptors.

4. discussion
the free radical hypothesis is thought to be the most
plausible mechanism explaining the progression of pd.
indeed, an increased deposition of iron w11x, which promotes the production of free radicals, has been reported in
the brains of patients with pd. in addition, biochemical

57

measurements on postmortem brains have shown increased
lipid peroxidation and reduced levels of free radical scavengers such as gsh, gsh peroxidase and catalase
w3,23,37x.
furthermore, it should be noted that free radicals are
inevitably produced by da metabolism in the brain
w1,22,35x. through the action of monoamine oxidase-b
žmao-b. or by auto-oxidation, da produces h 2 o 2 , which
reacts with iron to generate ho ø radicals. ho ø radicals
have the greatest cytotoxicity of all radicals and are thought
to cause lipid peroxidation, dna injury, and even neuronal death. excessive activation of cerebral da
metabolism by high-dose levodopa therapy may promote
oxidative stress and thereby accelerate the rate of cell
degeneration already observed in the substantia nigra of
patients with pd w32,40,41x. to minimize free radical
production in the brains of patients with pd, reduction of
the dose of levodopa andror concomitant use of antioxidants may be effective. ergot da agonists, which are
used as symptomatic therapy in pd, have been reported to
show free radical scavenging and antioxidant activity in
vitro w15,17,28,34,42,44x. use of da agonists may not
only suppress oxidation but also decrease the required dose
of levodopa. the present study showed that  xxxd3145xxx , a
non-ergot da agonist, had free radical scavenging and
antioxidant activity in vitro and a neuroprotective effect in
vivo. the action profiles of  xxxd3145xxx  were similar to those
reported previously for ergot da agonists, but somewhat
different in potency.  xxxd3145xxx  was much less potent than
ergot da agonists žpergolide and bromocriptine. in scavenging ho ø and no ø radicals and suppressing autooxidation in striatal tissues in vitro w17,28,34,44x, but was
as effective as ergot da agonists in protecting daergic
neurons against 6-ohda in vivo w4,34x. these findings
suggested that the in vitro free radical scavengingrantioxidant activity of  xxxd3145xxx  may not be the primary mechanism of its neuroprotective effect.
repeated pre-administration of  xxxd3145xxx  protected striatal daergic neurons against 6-ohda in mice žfig. 5. as
has been reported for pergolide and bromocriptine w4,34x.
furthermore, da agonists are also known to act on presynaptic d2 receptors žautoreceptors. at lower doses than
those needed to act on postsynaptic d2 receptors w36x,
thereby suppressing da turnover in the brain. a marked
increase in the striatal ždopacq hva.rda ratio, a
parameter of da turnover, was evident 1 week after the
i.c.v. injection of 6-ohda, as has been reported in pd
brains w29x. however, repeated pre-treatment with  xxxd3145xxx  before 6-ohda injection almost completely abolished
the increase in striatal da turnover induced by 6-ohda
žfig. 5.. this  xxxd3145xxx  effect against 6-ohda is consistent with our previous results with the ergot da agonists
bromocriptine and pergolide w4,34x. chronic administration
of pergolide also protected against age-related decreases in
nigrostriatal daergic neurons in rat brain w13x. therefore,
da agonists could normalize the decreased da synthesis

or storage and increased da turnover that was induced by
6-ohda.
 xxxd3145xxx  exerted a complete neuroprotective effect in
mice treated daily for 7 days žfig. 5., although the in vitro
free radical scavengingrantioxidant activity of  xxxd3145xxx 
was very weak žfig. 4.. in a previous in vitro neuronal
culture study, protective effects of bromocriptine against
glutamate toxicity were only observed when neurons were
pre-incubated with the drug, and the neuroprotective effect
was abolished by simultaneous treatment with a protein
synthesis inhibitor w38x. this finding suggests that protein
synthesis may be involved in the mechanism of neuroprotection by bromocriptine. of the various antioxidants in the
brain, the gsh system plays a major role in controlling
cellular redox states and is the primary defense mechanism
for peroxide removal from the brain. alterations in its
availability could promote formation of free radicals and
lead to cellular degeneration w35x. the strong neuroprotective effect of  xxxd3145xxx  may depend on increases in antioxidants, as repeated pre-administration of  xxxd3145xxx  enhanced the antioxidants, gsh, catalase and sod, thereby
increasing antioxidant activity in the striatum žfigs. 4 and
5..
it has also been reported that the protective effect of
bromocriptine on cultured neurons against glutamate toxicity can be blocked by  xxxd1927xxx , a da d2 receptorblocker w38x. in the present study, we used sulpiride, a da
 xxxg656xxx -blocker which can penetrate the blood-brain
barrier, to assess the neuroprotective effect of  xxxd3145xxx  in
vivo. pre-treatment with sulpiride prevented  xxxd3145xxx  from
enhancing striatal gsh, catalase and sod activity and
abolished the protection of daergic neurons against 6ohda. these findings indicated that activation of gsh,
catalase and sod mediated via da d2 receptors is a
mechanism of neuroprotection by  xxxd3145xxx .
in conclusion, repeated administration of  xxxd3145xxx  protected striatal daergic neurons against 6-ohda in mice,
probably by increasing gsh, catalase and sod activities
in the striatum. the activation of these antioxidants and the
neuroprotective effect of  xxxd3145xxx  are thought to be mediated by da d2 receptors.  xxxd3145xxx  also scavenges free
radicals and suppresses lipid peroxidation in vitro, but
these activities are very weak, suggesting that the antioxidant effect of  xxxd3145xxx  observed in vitro may be a minor
component of its neuroprotective effect in vivo. thus,
 xxxd3145xxx  may well exert its neuroprotective effect via
activation of gsh, catalase and sod activities, although
the reduced turnover of da in  xxxd3145xxx -treated animals
may also be a contributing factor.
