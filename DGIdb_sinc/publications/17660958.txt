opinion statement
treatment of early stage breast cancer requires a multimodality approach in order to
eradicate residual cancer and prevent recurrent disease. targeting the pathways that
promote or sustain cancer cell growth and invasion is critical to the effective treatment of breast and other cancers. overexpression of the family of her receptors have
been associated with a variety of malignancies; the first and best studied is the
association of overexpression of the her2/neu receptor with a more aggressive breast
cancer phenotype and poorer survival. a humanized antibody to her2/neu,  xxxd3412xxx , is now fda approved for the treatment of early stage, her2/neu overexpressing breast cancer sequenced with chemotherapy including doxorubicin,
cyclophosphamide, and paclitaxel. additional international and national studies
support the significant impact of  xxxd3412xxx  on both disease free and overall survival
in women with this aggressive form of breast cancer. toxicity includes a low but clear
risk of congestive heart failure, and the large phase iii trials have helped to determine
which patients are at higher risk for this complication. non-anthracycline containing
regimens are an alternative therapy associated with reduced cardiac toxicity.  xxxd3412xxx  therapy is now the standard of care for the treatment of early stage, her2/neu
positive breast cancer given in combination with one of several chemotherapy regimens. ongoing questions include the appropriate duration of  xxxd3412xxx  treatment
as well as the optimal chemotherapy regimen and sequence. the next large phase iii
adjuvant trial for this subset of breast cancer is an international collaboration designed to evaluate the added or alternative benefit of an oral  xxxg2198xxx  inhibitor
targeting her2/neu as well as the  xxxg682xxx  (egfr), lapatinib.
other trials are investigating differences in duration. studies in the neoadjuvant
setting should help to define markers of  xxxd3412xxx  and lapatinib sensitivity and
resistance. preliminary data combining  xxxd3412xxx  with the antiangiogenic antibody
bevacizumab is encouraging; this combination will be tested in both early stage and
late stage disease.

breast carcinoma

introduction
breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer
among women. despite improvements in diagnosis
and treatment, it is estimated that over 40,000 women
in the united states will die of this disease each year
[1]. prognostic and predictive factors help to predict
outcome and response to specific therapies. in addition to the prognostic factors of tumor size and grade,
extent of axillary lymph node involvement, and lymphovascular invasion; expression of hormone receptors (e.g.  xxxg730xxx ,  xxxg1737xxx )
and the her2/neu receptor are both predictive and
prognostic [2]. the her2/neu receptor is part of a
family of transmembrane  xxxg2198xxx  receptors;
gene amplification is associated with overexpression

of this growth factor receptor. found in approximately
20%–30% of breast cancers, amplification of the
her2/neu (c-erbb2) gene is associated with aggressive
clinical course: larger tumors, more commonly with
lymph-node involvement, and a shorter disease free
survival [3]. initially approved in combination with
chemotherapy for the treatment of metastatic disease
based on studies demonstrating improvement in response and survival,  xxxd3412xxx  was recently approved by the united states food and drug
administration (fda) for the treatment of early stage
 xxxg721xxx  overexpressing breast cancer based on
remarkable data from four phase iii randomized trials
[4••, 5••, 6••].

standard of care in early breast cancer
• although there is no universally accepted definition for early breast
cancer, in general clinical trials include patients with invasive adenocarcinoma that is not metastatic or locally advanced (stages i–iiia).
• early stage breast cancer is treated with a multimodality approach, which
includes surgical removal of the primary breast tumor with axillary
lymph node sampling, followed or preceeded by chemotherapy and
endocrine therapy as indicated. adjuvant radiation therapy is applied
after breast conservation and in the cases of higher risk disease.
• in an updated meta-analysis of 18,000 patients performed by the early
breast cancer trialists’ collaborative group, adjuvant chemotherapy of
several months duration improved 10 year survival by 7%–11% in patients under age 50 and 2%–3% in patients age 50–69 [7, 8].
• the use of anthracycline containing regimens results in improved relapse
free survival and overall survival compared to cyclophosphamide,
methotrexate, and 5-fluorouracil (cmf) as demonstrated in the canadian intergroup trial ma.5 [9]
• addition of taxanes to adjuvant anthracycline based chemotherapy improves disease free and in one study overall survival without overlapping
toxicities; this effect as well as the effect of anthracyclines is more pronounced in  xxxg1603xxx  negative and her2/neu overexpressing
disease [10–12].
• in patients whose tumors overexpress estrogen and/or progesterone
receptors, endocrine therapies include selective estrogen modulators
(serms, tamoxifen and  xxxd3402xxx ), aromatase inhibitors (e.g.  xxxd173xxx , letrozole, exemestane), and either surgical or chemical ovarian
ablation.

role of  xxxg721xxx 
• erbb2 is a protooncogene encoding the  xxxg721xxx  receptor, a protein
with  xxxg2198xxx  activity resulting in cellular differentiation and
proliferation. amplification of erbb2 (the gene for her2/neu) is associated with more aggressive tumors, more nodal metastases, and poorer
relapse free survival (rfs) as well as overall survival (os) [13].

s her2/neu positivity predicts sensitivity to anthracycline and taxane
based chemotherapy
s gene amplification and receptor overexpression are both prognostic
of outcome and predictive of response to specific therapy [14].
her2/neu positive tumors are defined as having protein overexpression
and/or gene amplification [15].
recent guidelines have set forth recommendations for testing and defined testing in relationship to treatment [16••, 17••]. it is recommended that her2/neu status be determined in all cases of invasive
breast cancer.
testing for the protein receptor is accomplished by immunohistochemistry (ihc). gene amplification is measured by fluorescence in situ
hybridization (fish); both tests should be performed in an experienced
laboratory in order to decrease the rates of false negatives or positives [18].
ihc utilizes one of several her2/neu specific antibodies to evaluate
protein expression in paraffin-embedded breast tissue and is scored
based on intensity of staining over a range from 0 to 3+.
fish determines her2/neu gene amplification by quantifying the
number of gene copies for her2 on chromosome 17 and has been
considered the ‘gold standard’ for assessing responsiveness to  xxxd3412xxx  [19, 20].
the pivotal trial in the metastatic setting as well as other trials demonstrated that a score of 3+ by ihc correlated with response to  xxxd3412xxx 
[21, 22], and with gene amplification as measured by fish [23].
a positive her 2 result is defined as ihc staining of 3+ (uniform,
intense membrane staining of > 30% of invasive tumor cells), or fish
testing with > 6 her2 gene copies per nucleus or a fish ratio (her2
gene signals to chromosome 17 signals) of more than 2.2.
a negative result is an ihc staining of 0 or 1+, a fish result of < 4.0
her2 gene copies per nucleus, or a fish ratio of < 1.8.
recent data has questioned the role of fish testing and suggests that a
positive result for either ihc or fish is sufficient to determine positivity
and support the use of  xxxd3412xxx  until further information is available.
approximately 25% of tumors that score in the 2+ range will demonstrate amplification by fish; all equivocal results require further testing.
the responsiveness of tumors that are ihc negative but positive by fish
to  xxxd3412xxx  remains unclear.
other methods used for her2/neu testing but not approved for clinical
use include protein evaluation with chromogenic in situ hybridization
( xxxg466xxx ), western blotting and enzyme-linked immunsorbent assay
(elisa), and evaluation of gene amplification with differential polymerase chain reaction (pcr), northern blotting or reverse transcription
polymerase chain reaction [24].

pharmacological properties of  xxxd3412xxx 
•  xxxd3412xxx  is a recombinant, humanized igg monoclonal antibody
that binds to extracellular domain of human  xxxg681xxx 
receptor-2 (her2/neu) and results in growth inhibition and apoptosis
of tumor cells expressing her2 [25].
•  xxxd3412xxx ’s actions involve several pathways and are still incompletely understood.

50

breast carcinoma
s down-regulation of signal transduction in breast tumor cells occurs
via the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (p13k) and mitogen-activated
protein kinase (mapk) pathways, which promotes cell cycle arrest via
the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor  xxxg419xxx  [26, 27].
s  xxxd3412xxx  also inhibits metalloproteinase mediated cleavage of
her2 [28] as well as target tumor cells expressing her-2 via antibody-dependent, cell-mediated cytotoxicity (adcc). in a murine
model that did not express fc gamma receptor that is involved in
adcc, fewer tumor cells were inhibited by  xxxd3412xxx  compared to
control group, which express fc gamma receptor found on natural
killer cells (29% vs 96%) [29].
s in addition,  xxxd3412xxx  has anti-angiogenesis effects by targeting
factors such as  xxxg2413xxx , plasminogen
activator inhibitor-1, and transforming growth factor-a, which result
in decreased microvessel density in vivo [30].

pharmacokinetic properties of  xxxd3412xxx  and drug interactions
• dosing schedules by intraveneous route:
s 4 mg/kg loading dose then 2 mg/kg weekly [25]
s 8 mg/kg loading dose then 6 mg/kg every 21 days [31].
•  xxxd3412xxx  has a half-life of approximately 21 days.
• based on in vitro cytotoxicity in her2 positive breast tumor cell lines, a
combination index score was derived from multiple drug-effect analysis
at fixed molar ratios with  xxxd3412xxx  [32].
s this demonstrated a synergistic interaction between  xxxd3412xxx 
combined with docetaxel, docetaxel plus carboplatin, platinum
agents alone, and  xxxd3515xxx   xxxd3516xxx . additive effects were shown with
paclitaxel, anthracyclines, and some antimetabolites. a variable effect
was seen with gemcitabine. combinations with 5-fluorouracil were
less than additive.
s this data was used to plan rational combinations of chemotherapy
with  xxxd3412xxx  for the phase iii adjuvant trials.
•  xxxd3412xxx  was initially approved for the treatment of metastatic,
her2/neu positive disease in combination with paclitaxel [22]. subsequent studies demonstrated efficacy in combination with docetaxel,
 xxxd3515xxx   xxxd3516xxx , and as a single agent [21].
• the primary toxicity in the metastatic setting is cardiac, and is influenced
by the extent of prior therapy with anthracyclines and pre-existing cardiac dysfunction.

phase iii trials
• 5 phase iii trials testing the use of  xxxd3412xxx  in addition to chemotherapy for early stage breast cancer have been performed with interim
results presented.
• all studies required patients to have a left ventricular ejection fraction
(lvef) greater than or equal to the institutional lower limit of normal
(llnl), and her2/neu positive disease as defined by an ihc of 3+ or
fish positivity.
• the north central cancer treatment group breast intergroup trial
(n9831) and national surgical adjuvant breast and bowel project
(nsabp b-31) [4••] joint analysis.
s eligibility included women with her2/neu overexpressing or gene
amplified breast cancer that was node-positive. the n9831 trial also

51

included high-risk node-negative disease (defined as a > 2 cm tumor
with positive hormone receptors (hr) or > 1 cm tumor with negative
hr).
s surgical margins were required to be clear of tumor, women with
inflammatory breast cancer or evidence of skin involvement were
excluded.
s study treatment was as follows:
• nsabp b-31 compared doxorubicin (60 mg/m2) and cyclophosphamide every 3 weeks for 4 doses followed by paclitaxel
(175 mg/m2) every 3 weeks for 4 doses (group 1, ac/p) with the
same regimen plus 52 weeks of weekly  xxxd3412xxx  beginning
with the first dose of paclitaxel (group 2, ac/pt).
• n9831 compared three regimens: ac followed by  xxxd2824xxx 
(80 mg/m2) for 12 doses (group a), the same regimen followed by
52 weeks of  xxxd3412xxx  after paclitaxel (group b), and the same
regimen plus 52 weeks of  xxxd3412xxx  beginning with the first
dose of paclitaxel (group c).
s the studies were amended to include a joint analysis comparing
groups 1 and a (the control group) with groups 2 and c (the  xxxd3412xxx  group). group b was excluded because  xxxd3412xxx  was not
given concurrently with paclitaxel.
s 1679 women in the control group (ac/p) were compared to 1672
women in the treatment group (ac/pt).
s as of march, 2005, 394 dfs events had been reported, triggering
the first interim efficacy analysis. the difference between the two
groups crossed early stopping rules and resulted in unblinding of the
trials.
s at a median follow-up of 2 years, the use of  xxxd3412xxx  in conjunction with standard chemotherapy resulted in a 12% absolute
improvement in disease-free survival (dfs) at 3 years (87.1% vs
75.4%, hazard ratio (hr), 0.48; p < 0.0001) and a 2.5% absolute
improvement in the risk of death (94.3% vs 91,7%, hr 0.67;
p = 0.015) [4••].
s a reduction was seen in both distant and locoregional events. brain
metastases were more common as the first site of distant relapse in
the t group (33 vs 15 events) due to earlier failures at other distant
sites in the control group, but were overall less frequent (b31: 28 vs
35).
s the principle adverse effect was cardiac dysfunction (n9831: 2.9% in
 xxxd3412xxx  group vs 0% in control group, b-31: 4.1% in  xxxd3412xxx  group vs 0.8% in control group).
s rare cases of interstitial pneumonitis were seen (9 patients treated
with  xxxd3412xxx ).
s most patients completed a full year of  xxxd3412xxx ; 31.4% discontinued at < 52 weeks. a total of 4.7% discontinued for symptomatic
cardiac effects and 14.2% for asymptomatic decline in lvef.
s 6.7% of patients were unable to go on from ac to pt due to reduced
cardiac function (defined as a decrease in lvef by at least 16% from
baseline, a fall below the llnl, or cardiac symptoms). the majority
of these patients recovered a normal lvef.
s a preliminary comparison of arm b from n9831 trial to arm c
suggested that concurrent administration of t with p might be
superior to sequential administration. a formal comparison is expected in 2009.

s eligibility for this breast international group (big) trial included
women with early stage invasive breast cancer that was node positive
or node negative with a tumor size greater than 1 cm.
s treatment included at least 4 cycles of adjuvant or neoadjuvant
chemotherapy and appropriate local-regional therapy followed by
randomization to one of three arms: no further treatment, one year
of t, and 2 years of t. t was given every 3 weeks in all patients. a
total of 5081 patients were enrolled and evaluable for outcome.
s an initial interim efficacy analysis was performed at a median followup of one year. at this time, benefits in dfs crossed the stopping
boundary and led to release of results comparing patients enrolled in
the observation arm (1693) to those receiving one year of t only
(1694).
s treatment characteristics were different from the combined analysis.
• approximately 33% of patients had node negative disease
• 94% of patients received an anthracycline, and 26% received a
taxane.
s t improved 2 year dfs by 8.4% (85.8% vs 77.4%, hr 0.54;

vs 82.8%, hr 0.49; p < 0.0001). at this first interim analysis, there
was no difference in os [5••].
s a subsequent analysis at a median follow-up of 2 years was presented
at asco in 2006. at a median follow-up of 2 years, improvement in
dfs was maintained, and os was also improved by 2.7% (92.4% vs
89.7%, hr 0.66; p = 0.0115). at this time, 861 patients were known
to have crossed over to t from the observation arm.
s benefit was seen from the addition of t in all subsets including patients with both hr positive and negative disease, and those with
node negative tumors.
s the primary toxicity was cardiac. a decrease in lvef was seen in 7%
of patients treated with t vs 2% in the observation group. symptomatic chf was noted in 1.7% vs 0.06%.
s efficacy results from patients treated with 2 years of t are expected in

across all grades as well.
s cardiac toxicity differed significantly between the two t containing

below).

side effects of  xxxd3412xxx  and cardiac toxicity
• common side effects (e.g. fever and chills) occur at the time of the
infusion in 25%–40% of patients and are easily controlled with

54

breast carcinoma
acetaminophen and diphenhydramine [21].
• other symptoms reported in at least 10% of patients in one monotherapy trial with  xxxd3412xxx  included pain, asthenia, headache, nausea, diarrhea, constipation, rash, flu-like symptoms, anxiety, insomnia,
and rhinitis [25].
• more serious effects such as bronchospasm, hypotension, and dyspnea
occur in approximately 0.3%.
• the most serious side effect is cardiac dysfunction defined generally as a
decline in left ventricular ejection fraction (lvef) more than 20% with
> 50% lvef, a decline greater 10% with lvef < 50%, or symptomatic
chf.
s in the adjuvant setting, the risk of cardiac toxicity appears to be
higher in patients with prior exposure to anthracyclines. the cumulative incidence of chf ranges from 1.1 to 3.3%, but a larger number
of women will experience a mild and transient decline in lvef.
 xxxd3412xxx  given with non-anthracycline based chemotherapy in
the bcirg trial did not increase the risk of chf over that seen with
ac/d (0.3%) compared to a 1.9% risk of chf in the ac/dt arm
[6••, 34••, 35••]
s risk factors for developing chf as determined in the nsabp b31 trial
include a lvef following ac of < 55% compared to 55% or higher
(12% vs 2.5%), age of 50 or older compared to < 50 (5.3% vs 2%),
and use of anti-hypertensive medications compared to no use (6.4%
vs 3%) [35••].
s potential mechanisms of  xxxd3412xxx  induced cardiotoxicity include
drug-drug interactions, immune mediated killing of cardiomyocytes,
alteration in cardiac contractility, and indirect effects of  xxxd3412xxx 
outside the heart [36]. her2 is essential in cardiac function.
s t should be discontinued in patients with a symptomatic decline in
lvef or chf. decisions about restarting therapy after cardiology
evaluation and recovery should be made on an individual basis; this
is generally appropriate in the metastatic setting only.
s an algorithm for modification of t use based on cardiac function in
asymptomatic patients modified from the adjuvant trials is set forth
in table 2. it is critical that lvef is monitored at baseline, followed
ac, following the combination of a taxane and t, and then every
3 months during therapy with t.

mechanisms of resistance
• despite the significant benefit seen with the addition of t to adjuvant
chemotherapy for early stage breast cancer, 15% of women relapsed at
only 2 years of median follow-up. this number is gradually increasing
over time and could affect over 25% of this population making resistance to t an important treatment consideration.
• a number of mechanisms have been postulated to explain resistance to
 xxxd3412xxx  including overexpression of the insulin-like growth factor-1
receptor ( xxxg1145xxx ) [37], increased levels of the her2 extracellular domain (ecd) derived from cleaved her2 protein [38], and alterations in
steps in the downstream signaling cascade [39].
• increased levels of the  xxxg2413xxx  receptor
(vegfr) have been associated with resistance to  xxxd3412xxx ; preclinical studies have demonstrated improvement in response with dual
blockade of these two pathways [40].
• an understanding of these mechanisms of resistance has led to a
number of clinical trials combining targeted agents in order to improve

response and prevent resistance [41], including the adjuvant trials outlined below.

summary of current recommendations, ongoing trials and emerging therapies
• current recommendations for therapy
s  xxxd3412xxx  should be included in the adjuvant treatment of women with early stage, her2/neu positive breast cancer.
s careful attention should be paid to the quality of her2/neu testing,
results should be confirmed by the combination of ihc and fish
when a question or discordance arises.
s chemotherapy regimens include ac/p, ac/d or dc combined with
t. regimens containing anthracyclines alone followed by t are also a
reasonable option.
s cardiac function should be closely monitored in all patients.
s the optimal duration of therapy with t is not known, current recommendations are to treat for a total of one year.
• ongoing and planned clinical trials
s the next large cooperative group randomized clinical trial is a collaboration between the u.s. breast intergroup and the breast international group.
s this trial is testing the addition or alternative use of lapatinib, an oral
 xxxg2198xxx  inhibitor (tki) that targets the epidermal growth
factor receptor (egfr) as well as her2. lapatinib was recently approved by the u.s. fda for the treatment of  xxxd3412xxx  resistant
metastatic breast cancer in combination with  xxxd425xxx  [42••].
• in the altto (adjuvant lapatinib and/or  xxxd3412xxx  treatment
optimisation) study, 8000 women with node positive or high risk
node negative (tumor size ‡ 1 cm) her2+ disease will be randomized into one of 4 treatment arms following completion of all
adjuvant or neoadjuvant anthracycline based chemotherapy
•  xxxd3412xxx  every 3 weeks for one year
• lapatinib, 1500 mg by mouth daily for one year
• the combination of every 3 weeks  xxxd3412xxx  and lapatinib,
1000 mg daily for one year.
• sequential  xxxd3412xxx  weekly for 12 weeks followed by a
6 week washout, followed by lapatinib, 1500 mg daily for
34 weeks.
• the study design allows optional paclitaxel given weekly for
12 weeks following anthracycline based therapy.
• if paclitaxel is given,  xxxd3412xxx  is given weekly with the chemotherapy followed by every 3 weeks dosing depending on the
treatment arm.

• translational studies including evaluation of  xxxg2312xxx  gene
expression, as well as an assessment of markers of resistance and
sensitivity to  xxxd3412xxx  or lapatinib will be performed.
• this study is expected to open to enrollment in late 2007.
s other planned clinical trials in the adjuvant setting include:
• a phase iii study of lapatinib after completion of adjuvant chemotherapy in women with her2/neu overexpressing tumors who
did not receive  xxxd3412xxx , the teach study.
• patients with a history of node positive or high risk node negative disease may be enrolled at any duration of time following
diagnosis.
• 3000 women will be randomized to take lapatinib, 1500 mg
daily for one year or placebo.
• a phase iii study of  xxxd3412xxx  duration modeled on the finher
trial, the sold study.
• approximately 3000 patients with a history of her2/neu overexpressing early stage breast cancer will be treated with docetaxel
with  xxxd3412xxx  for 3 cycles followed by fec for 3 cycles and
then randomized to receive one year of  xxxd3412xxx  or no further therapy.
• an italian study also evaluating duration of  xxxd3412xxx  therapy.
• following treatment with ac followed by p with  xxxd3412xxx ,
patients are randomized to one year of  xxxd3412xxx  vs no further therapy.
• a french cancer institute study randomizing patients to  xxxd3412xxx  for either 6 months or one year following any adjuvant
chemotherapy.
s a phase ii study in the metastatic setting [43] as well as preclinical
data [40] suggest that the combination of  xxxd3412xxx  and antiangiogenic therapy with the antibody to the vascular endothelial
growth factor receptor (vegf), bevacizumab, may be synergistic and
result in improved anti-tumor efficacy.
• a combined study is planned between the bcirg and the nsabp
foundation that will randomize patients with early stage, her2/
neu positive breast cancer to dcbt with or without bevacizumab.
the final trial design is still pending, but the study will include an
interim safety evaluation after the first 200 patients are enrolled.
s two trials in the neoadjuvant setting are also scheduled to open in
2007.
• neo-altto
• 450 women will be randomized to 6 weeks of  xxxd3412xxx , lapatinib or the combination for 6 weeks followed by the same
agent in combination with 12 weeks of paclitaxel followed by
surgery.
• all patients receive 9 weeks of fec chemotherapy following
surgery, followed by 34 weeks of the same assigned anti-her2/
neu directed therapy.
• biopsies will be obtained at treatment start, before starting
chemotherapy and at the time of surgery.
• gene expression, protein assays, and ihc for multiple markers
of resistance or sensitivity will be performed.
• u.s. cooperative group (calgb)
• women will be randomized to receive  xxxd2824xxx  for with
either  xxxd3412xxx , lapatinib or the combination followed by
surgery, followed by ac chemotherapy, then  xxxd3412xxx  for
one year.

breast carcinoma
• biopsies will be obtained at treatment start, during therapy and
at surgery for gene and protein analysis as outlined above.
s multiple novel therapies are being tested in the metastatic setting in
phase i and ii trials including immunotoxins, antibodies, multitargeted tkis, vaccines and others.

conclusion
• overexpression of the her2/neu receptor or amplification of the
her2/neu (erbb2) gene has been associated with a more aggressive
phenotype of early stage breast cancer. several large trials incorporating the humanized monoclonal antibody against her2,  xxxd3412xxx , into adjuvant chemotherapy schema have demonstrated
marked improvements in both dfs and os in patients with known
her2/neu positive disease. the primary toxicity across all trials is
cardiac, with the potential for reduced cardiac toxicity when a nonanthracycline regimen is used, or  xxxd3412xxx  is given for a shorter
duration preceeding anthracycline therapy.  xxxd3412xxx  is now fda
approved for the treatment of early stage breast cancer in conjunction
with adjuvant chemotherapy and should be the standard of care for
patients with node positive or high risk node negative disease. cardiac
function should be carefully monitored in all patients. new studies
are evaluating the addition or alternative use of an oral tki to her2
and egfr in both the adjuvant and neoadjuvant settings, the
appropriate duration of  xxxd3412xxx  use, and the addition of antiangiogenic therapy to  xxxd3412xxx . these studies will obtain important information on factors associated with response or resistance to
 xxxd3412xxx  and other targeted therapies.
