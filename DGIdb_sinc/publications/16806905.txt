abstract
4-hydroxy tamoxifen ( xxxd3285xxx ) and  xxxd3436xxx  interact differently with the  xxxg730xxx  (er).  xxxd3285xxx  is a competitive inhibitor whereas
 xxxd3436xxx  has direct, but non-competitive effects on er. this study compared the effects of  xxxd3285xxx  and  xxxd3436xxx , in the presence of 17␤ xxxd2037xxx  (e2) on gene expression in mcf-7 breast cancer cells using microarrays each representing nearly 20,000 human genes. striking
differences between the sets of genes affected by these two drugs were observed. both  xxxd3285xxx  and  xxxd3436xxx  affected transcription of genes
involved in cell cycle regulation, cell adhesion and matrix formation, however, only 12.5% of  xxxd3436xxx  down-regulated genes and 9.2% of
up-regulated genes were similarly regulated by  xxxd3285xxx . a selective up-regulation of er␤ by  xxxd3436xxx , but not  xxxd3285xxx , was observed and confirmed
by qrt-pcr. similar up-regulation of this gene by  xxxd3436xxx  was observed in the uterus of  xxxd3436xxx -treated (4 mg/kg for 7 days) rats, in
which er␤ mrna (3-fold) and er␤ protein expression (10-fold) were both increased. these data show that  xxxd3285xxx  and  xxxd3436xxx  regulate the
expression of different sets of genes, reflecting their different modes of interaction with er.  xxxd3436xxx -specific up-regulation of er␤ could
explain its positive benefit rates in acquired tamoxifen resistance.

1. introduction
tamoxifen, and its active metabolite 4-hydroxy tamoxifen
( xxxd3285xxx ), has been the drug of choice for treatment of hormonally responsive breast cancer for many years [1,2]. as a consequence of its differential tissue effects – anti-oestrogenic
in breast and a partial antagonist in endometrium – it has
been regarded as a selective  xxxg730xxx  modulator
(serm) [3], even though its relative affinities for binding to
the two  xxxg730xxx  (er) subtypes, er␣ and er␤,
are equivalent [4]. apart from the greater risk of endometrial cancer in tamoxifen-treated patients there is a much
more common problem of acquired resistance to tamoxifen
where cancer recurs despite continued treatment [5]. largely

as a result of these limitations, tamoxifen’s status as first line
endocrine treatment of choice is now being challenged by a
new generation of aromatase inhibitors (ais) which, rather
than selectively competing with oestrogen at the er, reduce
the local supply of oestrogen to the breast tumour [6,7].
ais are therefore non-selective with respect to the actions of
oestrogens through er␣ and er␤ and elicit a different profile
of side effects, particularly on bone [8]. however, development of resistance to these ai treatments is also a common
occurrence [9].
tamoxifen competes with 17␤- xxxd2037xxx  (e2) for binding in the ligand-binding domain (lbd) of er. once bound,
tamoxifen causes a specific conformational change in er
that, at least in the breast, prevents the binding of coactivators and reduces gene transcription mediated at oestrogenresponse element (ere)-dependent gene promoters [10].
other anti-oestrogens, such as raloxifene and  xxxd2165xxx  (ici

182 780), also act by competitively displacing e2 from its
hydrophobic ligand-binding pocket and induce defined and
different alterations in er conformation [11,12].
 xxxd3436xxx  (which was originally introduced as an inhibitor
of 3-beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase) [13] has also been
used for treatment of hormone-responsive breast cancer
[14–16] and, importantly, has proven efficacy in advanced
post-menopausal breast cancer after development of acquired
resistance to tamoxifen or the aromatase inhibitor  xxxd147xxx  [17].  xxxd3436xxx  is a steroid that has direct effects
on er without displacing e2 from, or competing with e2 for,
binding in the er lbd [18]. it changes the binding kinetics
of e2 binding to er and, in a mixed receptor population from
rat uterine homogenates (containing both er␣ and er␤), it
caused a shift in binding preference of e2 from er␣ to favour
binding to er␤. in addition, we observed a concentrationdependent inhibition of oestrogen-stimulated ere–reporter
activity in both mcf-7 and t- xxxd751xxx  breast cancer cells by
 xxxd3436xxx , with a threshold inhibition at 1 ␮m  xxxd3436xxx  [18].
this action of  xxxd3436xxx  is therefore similar to that of tamoxifen, which also inhibits oestrogen-dependent ere–reporter
activity [19]. however, we have also observed differences
between tamoxifen and  xxxd3436xxx  in activating protein-1 ( xxxg1222xxx ) reporter systems whereby  xxxd3436xxx  inhibits oestrogen and
growth factor ( xxxg681xxx  — egf) stimulated
 xxxg1222xxx -activity while tamoxifen does not [20]. this has led us
to postulate that the distinct modes of action of tamoxifen
and  xxxd3436xxx  would have a profound affect on the action
of er at different gene promoters. we therefore decided
to compare the effects of these two drugs in the presence
of e2, on gene transcription, using microarray technology.
the aim was to identify groups of genes either co-regulated
by  xxxd3436xxx  and tamoxifen, or groups of genes selectively
regulated by  xxxd3436xxx . this extends our previous studies in
simple reporter assay systems showing that  xxxd3436xxx  can
repress gene transcription at an ere (as does tamoxifen) but
could also affect ap-1-mediated gene transcription (where
tamoxifen does not) [18,20]. it is important to establish the
consequences of these differences in terms of both the mechanism of action of  xxxd3436xxx  and in terms of clinical therapy.

2. materials and methods
2.1. materials
unless otherwise stated, all cell culture media and supplements were obtained from sigma–aldrich co. ltd., poole,
uk.  xxxd3436xxx  was supplied by stegram pharmaceuticals
ltd. (billingshurst, uk). microarray hybridisations and initial imagenetm (biodiscoverytm inc., los angeles, usa)
analyses were carried out by mwg-biotech (ebersberg, germany). for in vivo experiments, adult female wistar rats
(12–14 weeks old) were obtained from commercial suppliers,
and maintained at queen mary, university of london, under
standard conditions of light and temperature, in accordance

with appropriate guidelines for animal care under home
office licence.
2.2. cell culture and drug treatment
mcf-7 breast cancer cells (atcc) were routinely cultured in modified eagles medium containing 5% fetal bovine
serum (fbs) [18] and then for 5 days in two changes of dulbecco’s modified eagle’s medium without phenol red and
supplemented with 10% dextran-coated charcoal treated fbs
to exclude steroids within the serum. the cells were then
treated for 72 h in the presence of vehicle (1%, v/v methanol)
alone or with 10 nm e2, or e2 (10 nm) plus 1 ␮m  xxxd3285xxx , or
e2 (10 nm) plus 10 ␮m  xxxd3436xxx .
2.3. microarray analysis
after aspiration of the culture media, total rna was
extracted from each of three replicate 75 cm2 cell culture
flasks containing confluent monolayers of mcf-7 cells using
trizol reagent (invitrogen, paisley, uk). total rna from
each of the flasks was pooled to give a represent average sample of rna from each of the test treatments. the rna was
treated with dnase and then subjected to a further round of
purification using rneasy columns (qiagen, crawley, uk).
rna was stored at −80◦ until required. the final total purity
and integrity was tested using a 2100 bioanalyzer (agilent technologies, south queensferry, uk) to ensure that
rna samples were not degraded and therefore contained all
expressed full length rna transcripts in the individual sample pools.
fluorescently labelled crnas were synthesised at mwg
biotech (ebersberg, germany — transferred to ocimum
biosolutions, nűrnberg, germany), using a t7 amplification
protocol, from 10 ␮g of total rna per sample. briefly, this
involves first strand cdna synthesis with avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase (roche products ltd., welwyn garden city, uk) and an oligo[dt24 –t7promoter]65
primer (roche products ltd.). double-stranded dna
(dsdna) was then synthesised through second strand synthesis using dna polymerase. after treatment with rnase i
and proteinase k, dsdna was column purified and stored at
−20 ◦ c until required. crnas incorporating either cyanine3 (cy3)-utp or cyanine-5 (cy5)-utp were then produced
corresponding to each test sample rna using t7 rna polymerase (ambion rna diagnostics, austin, usa). for each
comparison, cy3 and cy5 labelled crnas for each sample were co-hybridised with the oligonucleotide array which
contained specific oligomers (∼50 mers), 19,968 individual
spots per glass slide (human 40k gene array – section a –
mwg biotech). the same amount of crna was used for each
hybridisation. signals from either cy3 or cy5 were read on
different channels in an affymetrix 428 array scanner. different colours were assigned to the cy3 and cy5 signals using
imagenetm analysis software (biodiscovery inc., los angeles, usa) to allow relative comparison of test sample hybridi-

sation by overlay of signal intensities. a dye swap experiment
in which comparisons were made in reverse dye orientation
was also carried out to eliminate false positives that might
arise from dye bias. dye bias can occur due to different dye
incorporation or performance of the dye in the experiment.
differences in intensities for cy3 and cy5 were also normalised using a linear regression method (mavi-microarray
analysis validation [21]) and corrected for background fluorescence using the imagenetm analysis software. different
photomultiplier-tube gain-settings were used to obtain valid
data from both strong (saturated) and weak (low signal) signals. the microarray readouts used for final comparison were
therefore from a duplicate analysis of pooled total rna from
three experiments. the use of a 2-fold cut-off was recommended as it had previously been shown to yield reliable and
significant data for gene regulation. the use of even a single
replicate of a microarray experiment as a ‘first pass’ in developing a hypothesis for further investigation has been accepted
previously, as has the pooling of rna samples to reduce biological variability in the cell culture system [22]. k-means
clustering analysis was carried out using genesighttm analysis software (biodiscovery inc., los angeles, usa). this is
a hierarchical clustering system using rows and columns for
the cluster choice, and a euclidean distance metric (dr. betz,
personal communication). results obtained for certain genes
were verified using quantitative rt-pcr (qrt-pcr) using
total rna obtained from subsequent separate experiments
under identical conditions as those used in the microarray
experiment.
2.4. qrt-pcr
qrt-pcr was carried out using mcf-7 cell total rna
from repeat experiments that paralleled the treatments used
in the microarray study. rna was extracted using trizol
reagent and quantified by uv absorption at 260 nm. cdna
was synthesised using superscriptase ii reverse transcriptase
(invitrogen) and pcr amplification using platinum taq polymerase (invitrogen).
fluorescent detection of amplified product was achieved
using specific dual labelled fam (6-carboxyfluorescein)tamra
(n,n,n ,n -tetramethyl-6-carboxyrhodamine)
probes (applied biosystems, warrington, uk) using an
mx3000p real time pcr system (stratagene, lajolla,
usa). initially, standard curves were set up for each probe
to establish the appropriate amount of total rna to be used.
subsequently, comparative analysis was carried out between

143

samples using an appropriate sample set as a calibrator
to which each further sample was then calculated as a
relative value for cycle threshold (ct ). joe (6-carboxy-4 ,5 dichloro-2 7 -dimethoxyfluorescein)-labelled luxtm (light
upon extension) primers (invitrogen) corresponding to
hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase-1 ( xxxg1075xxx -1) were
used as a reference housekeeping gene.
2.5. in vivo experiments in wistar rats
ovary-intact female wistar rats were injected subcutaneously with  xxxd3436xxx  dissolved in 10% ethanol in
cottonseed oil (2 mg/0.1 ml), 4 mg/kg/day (n = 6) or with
10% ethanol in cottonseed oil alone (control animals, n = 6).
the treatment period was for 7 days after which time the
rats were injected inter-peritoneally with 100 u of heparin.
after 15 min the rats were killed by stunning and cervical
dislocation. vaginal smears were taken at the end of the
treatment period, and just prior to killing by cervical dislocation. smears were stained with haematoxylin and eosin to
determine the stage of the oestrous cycle. uteri were then
removed, weighed, snap-frozen and stored in liquid nitrogen
until required. tissue was ground by mortar and pestle under
liquid nitrogen and further disrupted in rnalater stabilization buffer using qiashredder columns (qiagen). total rna
was purified using rneasy columns (qiagen) and quantified
by measuring the absorbance at 260 nm. rt-pcr was carried
out using 200 ng of total rna per reaction. oligonucleotide
primers are defined in table 1. the rt-pcr protocol (access
rtpcr, promega) involved an initial rt step for 45 min
at 48◦ followed by of cycles of denaturation at 94◦ for
1 min, annealing for 30 s (see table 1), and 68◦ for 2 min.
the amplification ended with a final extension at 68◦ for
7 min.
for immunoblotting, anti-er␤ antibody h-150 (santa
cruz biotechnology inc., santa cruz, usa) was used. frozen
tissues were ground in liquid nitrogen and homogenised on
ice using an ultraturrax t25 homogeniser (janke & kunkel,
ika-labortechnik, staufen, germany) in 1 ml phosphate
buffer saline containing 1% nonidet p-40, 0.5%  xxxd1835xxx , 0.1%  xxxd3215xxx , supplemented with
pmsf (0.1 mg/ml) and 5 ␮l/ml of protease inhibitor cocktail
(sigma p8340). samples were then centrifuged  xxxd1891xxx ,000 × g
for 10 min at 4◦ . the supernatant was taken as the total cell
lysate and protein assayed by a detergent insensitive dc assay
(bio-rad, hertfordshire, uk). proteins were separated on
an 11% sds-page gel after denaturation in laemmli loading

to breast tumour cell function, although some additional genes are included. these further selected genes are the basis for table 3 ( xxxd3285xxx -regulated) and table 4

buffer [23] at 70◦ for 10 min. the proteins were transferred to
hybond-ecl nitrocellulose membranes (amersham pharmacia biotech, amersham, uk). to reduce non-specific binding
the membranes were first treated with pbs containing 5%
non-fat dry milk powder and then incubated with primary
antibody (1:100, v/v) in pbs containing 0.05% tween 20
(pbs–tween) containing 5% non-fat dry milk powder at 4◦
overnight. after extensive rinsing and washing for 1 h with
pbs–tween, membranes were then probed with horseradish
peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit igg secondary antibody (1:2000, v/v) for 1 h in and pbs–tween containing 5%
non-fat dry milk at room temperature, before a final wash
step. bands were visualized using ecl reagents (amersham

3.1. assessment of e2 versus e2 plus  xxxd3285xxx  or e2 plus

table 2 shows the number of genes that were significantly
down-regulated (>50% reduced versus comparison) or

up-regulated (>2-fold increase versus comparison) in dye
swap experiments for each of the different comparisons
carried out. a significant proportion of each of these gene
sets could be classified as either unrelated to breast cancer
cell survival pathways (according to current interpretation)
or not sufficiently functionally characterised, present in the
human genome but described in the database as hypothetical
or similar to or of unknown function. such genes were
excluded from the subsequent list of selected genes of interest. tables 3 and 4 show details of gene expression for those
genes of interest that are potentially relevant to breast cancer
cell survival, related to steroid receptor or growth factor
pathways, and of known function. these genes have been
categorised on the basis of this known function. of these,
only 12.5% of  xxxd3436xxx  down-regulated and 9.2% of upregulated genes were commonly regulated by  xxxd3285xxx . of the
very few genes which were coincidentally regulated by both
 xxxd3436xxx  and  xxxd3285xxx  in the presence of e2, these included the
cell matrix protein, fibronectin [24], and the prostaglandin
synthesising enzyme, cyclo-oxygenase 2 (cox-2 — a breast
cancer therapeutic target in its own right [25]), which was
down-regulated by both  xxxd3285xxx  and  xxxd3436xxx . the so-called
egf receptor pathway substrate 15 protein (eps-15), a

table shows gene changes selected as either >2-fold increase or >50% inhibition after treatment for 72 h with e2 (10 nm) plus  xxxd3285xxx  (1 ␮m) with respect to
mcf-7 cells treated with e2 (10 nm) alone. data represents pooled rna from three separate experiments and uses dye swap duplicates as a basis for identifying
robust changes in gene expression. (>50% inhibition equates to >−2-fold change). genes in italics were genes regulated by both 4-hydroxy tamoxifen ( xxxd3285xxx )
and  xxxd3436xxx .

protein associated with egf receptor endocytosis [26], was
up-regulated by both treatments. there was a tendency for
 xxxd3436xxx  treatment to up-regulate cell matrix proteins and
cell adhesion molecules, such as collagen, laminin and cadherins, while it down-regulated metalloproteinases  xxxg1419xxx 
and -15 and conversely,  xxxd3285xxx  tended to down-regulate matrix
proteins (fig. 1). however, there was no significant clustering of gene sets found in this study using k-means clustering
analysis (data not included). indeed, the vast majority of

genes regulated by these two drugs were not the same, even
though some genes may be involved in similar pathways.
of direct relevance to our original studies of  xxxd3436xxx ’s
mode of action [18] was the observation that er␤ gene transcription was selectively up-regulated by  xxxd3436xxx . indeed,
up-regulation by  xxxd3436xxx  of er␤1 was accompanied by
similar up-regulation of er␤3, with each of the mrnas for
these gene variants increased ∼2.5-fold above the levels of
expression in e2-treated cells in the microarray experiment.

qrt-pcr validation of the microarray data with respect to
selected genes confirmed that  xxxd3436xxx  and  xxxd3285xxx  have different effects on specific gene transcription, and some effects in
common in the presence of oestrogen. oestrogen-dependent
up-regulation of  xxxg1419xxx  gene transcription was selectively
reduced in the presence of  xxxd3436xxx , but not in the presence of  xxxd3285xxx  (fig. 2a). in contrast, eps-15 was positively
co-regulated by both  xxxd3436xxx  and  xxxd3285xxx  (fig. 2b). these
findings were in agreement with the changes observed for
these genes within the microarray experiment. in addition,
the  xxxd3436xxx -specific increase in er␤ gene transcription

changes was confirmed in separate qrt-pcr experiments
in mcf-7 cells (fig. 2c). levels of the housekeeping gene
 xxxg1075xxx  mrna were not altered by any of the treatments
(fig. 2d).

threshold (ct ) values for these two receptor subtypes (using
62.5 ng of rna template) were 19.6 ± 0.06 and 29.2 ± 1.1
(mean ± s.d.; n = 3), respectively, which equates to a 1000fold higher relative abundance of er␣ over er␤, assuming
comparable amplification efficiencies for the two specific
probes used, and equal stability of mrna species. we therefore investigated the effects of  xxxd3436xxx  in vivo in a classical
target tissue, rat uterus. we found that er␤ mrna expression
levels were increased 3-fold (fig. 3) and consistent with the
increase in er␤ mrna,  xxxd3436xxx  also increased er␤ protein
levels in the uterus 10-fold (fig. 4). in fact, er␤ protein levels
changed from virtually undetectable in un-treated animals, to
significantly expressed in  xxxd3436xxx -treated animals (a ∼10fold increase). the dose of  xxxd3436xxx  used in these studies
was below that required to give a significant decrease in circulating steroid (data not shown). furthermore,  xxxd3436xxx  did
not prevent progression through the normal oestrous cycle:
at the end of the treatment period vaginal smears showed that
four of the  xxxd3436xxx -treated animals were in metoestrus, one
was dioestrus and one was proestrus.

turn influences coactivator/corepressor recruitment [28]. for
tamoxifen (and  xxxd3285xxx ) this has been shown to result from a
shift of er ligand-binding domain (lbd) helix 12 to a new
location, thus eliminating the interaction of specific coactivators with er [29]. in addition, a further tier of regulation via
coactivator recruitment can be exerted by the tertiary structure

4. discussion
there is a great complexity in protein–protein interactions
that determine the gene expression profile of a particular cell
at a given time point, however, a key element is the nature
of ligand interaction with transcriptional enhancer proteins
such as the er [11,12,27]. thus a serm, such as tamoxifen, can mediate tissue/cell-specific outcomes by virtue of
the specific conformational change it elicits in er, which in

 xxxd3436xxx  treatment. (a) representative immunoblot; (b) mean of the od

of different response elements within different gene promoter
settings [30]. an altogether different interaction with er
shown by  xxxd3436xxx , as a non-competitive/allosteric modulator of er function, might therefore be expected to result
in an alternative receptor conformation with a distinct effect
on coactivator/corepressor recruitment and thereby on gene
expression. it may be of particular importance that  xxxd3436xxx 
modulates the action of  xxxd2037xxx  without competing for
binding of  xxxd2037xxx  in the natural lbd of er [18].
the results of the global microarray experiment indicate
that, indeed,  xxxd3285xxx  and  xxxd3436xxx  in the presence of e2 alter the
gene expression profile of mcf-7 cells in very different ways,
with transcriptional up- or down-regulation of relatively few
genes being similarly effected by these two distinctly acting
drugs. although the expression of genes relating to similar cellular functions such as cell cycle progression and
cell–cell adhesion and cell matrix proteins was affected by
both  xxxd3285xxx  and  xxxd3436xxx , these were mostly different proteins. it is acknowledged that this array experiment can only
provide a snapshot of the effects of these two drugs on gene
transcription profiles in mcf-7 cells. however, the use of
72 h as a time point in microarray studies has been previously reported [31,32], and 72 h can be regarded as a stable
end-point after direct transcriptional effects and more indirect secondary effects have occurred. in fact, this time point
was chosen after other studies showed a differential effect
of  xxxd3436xxx  and  xxxd3285xxx  on er in an ap-1 reporter system
[20]. moreover, during treatment of breast cancer, exposure
to these compounds is for a much longer duration — from
months to years. the important observation is therefore, not
necessarily the precise combinations of genes that have been
affected by these two treatments after this period of time, but
more that the effects are so strikingly different. this must be
due to fundamental differences in how these two molecules
interact with er and how these differences impact on the variety of transcriptional multi-protein complexes with which the
er interacts.
from the array experiment it was possible to identify certain genes whose transcription was selectively modulated by
 xxxd3436xxx  and not by  xxxd3285xxx . er␤ mrna levels were elevated
more than 2-fold by  xxxd3436xxx  in the presence of e2 compared with e2 alone. this increase was not shown for  xxxd3285xxx 
in the presence of e2. furthermore, this was true for the main
er␤ transcript and also for er␤ isoform 3, a c-terminal
variant derived from alternate splicing of the er␤ gene
[33–34]. er␤ up-regulation in mcf-7 cells was confirmed
in separate experiments using qrt-pcr where a similar 2fold increase in expression was observed. similarly, selective
down-regulation of  xxxg1419xxx  by  xxxd3436xxx  and coincidental
up-regulation of eps-15 by both  xxxd3436xxx  and  xxxd3285xxx  were
consistent in both the microarray experiment and in subsequent experiments using qrt-pcr, although these latter
observations were not developed further. there are obvious
issues regarding the relevance of the gene expression changes
observed in these studies and how they relate to the treatment
of breast cancer itself. these arise because of the inherent

149

variability in microarray data from tumour to tumour and
cell line to cell line. for example, it has been reported that
the gene expression profiles for cell lines implanted in vivo
are dramatically different from those of the same cell line in
culture [35]. this is also apparent with only minor changes in
culture conditions for the same cell line in vitro (unpublished
observations). in fact, a very rigorous use was made of the
2-fold cut-off rule and only those genes showing the same
direction of change were accepted for these studies. so the
data presented here represents a platform from which it will
be possible to focus on selected gene promoters, differentially regulated by  xxxd3436xxx  and  xxxd3285xxx , in order to understand
more fully the effects of  xxxd3436xxx  via er at the dna level.
the effects on er␤ mrna were of particular interest
because of the importance of this receptor in  xxxd3436xxx ’s
mode of action [18]. the human er␤ gene promoter contains an unconventional ere in the form of an alu-ere
region from position −1416 to −1703 [36,37] that is thought
to enhance transcription in an oestrogen-dependent manner,
but this would not explain our results showing trilostaneinduced er␤ mrna. however, there is also a negative regulatory element (nre) associated with putative ap-1 binding
sites within the region between −594 and −178 [36] (also
a feature of the mouse er␤ promoter [38]), which could
provide a route for  xxxd3436xxx -mediated induction of transcription through alleviation of the repression in this region of
the promoter. this is possible at least for the human promoter, since we have shown that  xxxd3436xxx  is able to block
ap-1 reporter activity in both breast cancer cells [17] and
prostate epithelial cells (data not shown). the precise mechanism for this effect is unclear but could relate to a disruption
or interference with binding of the ap-1 protein complex
to the nre-associated ap-1 element thereby facilitating an
increase in er␤ gene transcription. we know that er␤1 and
er␤3 are both expressed in mcf-7 cells (data not shown) but
it is not known how the process of alternate splicing during
er␤ gene transcription is regulated in these cells.
the observation (table 2) that more down-regulated genes
were modulated by tamoxifen (plus  xxxd2037xxx ) than  xxxd3436xxx 
(plus  xxxd2037xxx ) can be explained if one assumes that er
␤ has functions in its own right. that some of these may
involve up-regulation of genes, either directly or by release of
repression, may explain some of the positive effects of oestrogen through er␤. however, it is difficult to reconcile this
selective up-regulation of er␤ with the selective repression
of oestrogen-stimulated  xxxg1419xxx  gene transcription and coregulation of eps-15 in these cells without substantial further
work. definitive information in this regard requires extensive
and direct experimental investigation of promoter function,
which is beyond the scope of the current studies.
the gene changes observed in the microarray and further
validated by qrt-pcr have not previously been reported as
targets for regulation by tamoxifen or  xxxd3436xxx , either in
vivo or in the clinical setting, however, despite the lack of
such mechanistic information, treatment of rats for 7 days
resulted in an increase in er␤ at both the mrna and protein

150

level specifically in the rat uterus, which was chosen as an
oestrogen-responsive target tissue in which er␣ and ␤ are
both known to be co-expressed, although levels of er␤ have
been found to be low or undetectable in this tissue [39]. furthermore, er␤ levels do not change during the various stages
of the oestrous cycle [40,41]. this suggests that the changes
in er␤ mrna and protein levels seen in our study are due
to direct actions of  xxxd3436xxx .
the up-regulation of er␤ isoforms by  xxxd3436xxx  could
be seen as a part of the mechanism by which it exerts its
inhibitory effect on breast cancer cell survival. er␤ is known
to inhibit the actions of oestrogens through er at both ere
and ap-1 regulated genes [42,43]. in contrast, tamoxifen,
and indeed raloxifene and the pure anti-oestrogen ici 164
384, have been shown to have stimulatory effects through
er␤ acting on ap-1 complexes [44]. this may explain why
 xxxd3436xxx  can still be effective after tumours have become
refractory and begin to reassert themselves during prolonged
exposure to tamoxifen. furthermore, er␤ has been shown to
be a positive prognostic indicator in breast cancer [45], associated with lower grade tumours [46] and also with a reduced
likelihood of tumour recurrence after tamoxifen therapy [47].
these findings confirm a novel mode of action of
 xxxd3436xxx , and one that enhances er␤ expression in oestrogen target tissues. overexpression of er␤ in breast cancer
cells in culture renders them more sensitive to tamoxifen and
prevents development of tamoxifen-resistance [48]. decline
in er␤ levels is correlated with tumour progression [49] and
er␤ expression in primary tumours has been associated with
negative nodal status [50]. because acquired tamoxifen resistance is accompanied by an increase in ap-1 dna binding
activity [51], an increase in er␤ as a result of  xxxd3436xxx  treatment would act in opposition to this. thus, in the clinic, this
may translate to the positive effect of  xxxd3436xxx  with respect to
disease stabilization and remission after treatment with other
endocrine agents has failed [17].
