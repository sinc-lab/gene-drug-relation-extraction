summary: the present study was designed to evaluate the bronchodilating role of  xxxd3545xxx , a  xxxg599xxx 
receptor antagonist, at the standard dosage currently recommended in the marketing of this agent in smokers with
copd. the study was performed using a double-blind, cross-over, randomized design and was conducted on 2
non-consecutive days. sixteen outpatients suffering from stable copd received 40 mg oral  xxxd3545xxx , or placebo.
lung function was controlled before drug administration and 30, 60, 120, 180, 240 min thereafter. at the end of
the 4-h period, each patient received 400 g inhaled salbutamol and spirometric testing was performed 30 min
later.  xxxd3545xxx , but not placebo, produced a significant (p<0.05) bronchodilation between 30 min and 4 h
following administration, with a maximum mean increase in fev1 of 0.134 l (11.2%) above baseline after 2 h.
nine of 16 patients showed an increase in fev1 of at least 15% above baseline after  xxxd3545xxx . the maximum
mean increase in fev1 after  xxxd3545xxx  in these subjects, who were considered responders, observed after 2 h, was
0.221 (19.4%). the mean difference of post-salbutamol fev1 values after  xxxd3545xxx  and placebo (−0.036 l) was
not significant (p>0.05). in responders, the mean of differences in pre- and post-salbutamol fev1 values after
 xxxd3545xxx  was 0.077 l, whereas the mean of differences between post-salbutamol values after  xxxd3545xxx  and those
after placebo was −0.064 l. the mean auc0–4 h for all patients was 0.121 l for placebo and 0.385 l for  xxxd3545xxx .
the difference between the placebo and  xxxd3545xxx  auc0–4 h was significant (p<0.05). the individual fev1 auc0–4 h
after  xxxd3545xxx  were higher than those after placebo in 12 out of 16 patients. these findings suggest that cysteinyl
leukotrienes might be one of the causes of persistent bronchoconstriction in copd, at least in several smokers,
but do not confirm the hypothesis that the effects of  xxxd3545xxx  and salbutamol are independent and additive.

administration of  xxxd3545xxx  resulted in a 5–10% improvement in fev1. in the same patients, inhalation
of a 2-agonist increased fev1 by 20–30%. however,
the eﬀects of the 2-agonist were additive with the
eﬀects of the  xxxg599xxx  antagonist; this observation suggests that distinct contractile mechanisms
are involved in each response.
similar results were found in several other trials
of similar design in which diﬀerent  xxxg599xxx 
antagonists were examined.2–5 these data indicate that
a significant component of asthmatic bronchoconstriction is directly due to the action of leukotrienes at their receptors. it is possible that the

the cysteinyl leukotrienes ltc4, ltd4, and lte4 can
cause airway smooth muscle contraction and have
been implicated in the pathophysiology of asthma.
the capacity of a  xxxg599xxx  antagonist to
reverse asthmatic bronchoconstriction was first shown
by hui and barnes1 in a group of patients with
moderately severe asthma, most of whom were using
inhaled steroids. hui and barnes showed that the

stimuli resulting in leukotriene synthesis are continuously activated. in fact, the  xxxg147xxx  inhibitor  xxxd3554xxx  was as eﬀective as cysteinyl
leukotriene antagonists in reversing asthmatic bronchoconstriction.6
the eﬀects of cysteinyl leukotriene antagonists in
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (copd) have
never been reported, although a number of diﬀerent
investigative groups demonstrated the presence of
cysteinyl leukotrienes in sputum of patients with
chronic bronchitis.7–9
therefore, in the present study we sought to evaluate the bronchodilation elicited by oral  xxxd3545xxx  in
comparison to that of oral placebo in a group of
smokers with stable copd.

patients and methods
sixteen smokers with moderate-to-severe copd, but
in a stable phase of the disease, participated in the
study after giving their informed consent. all fulfilled
the criteria proposed by the american thoracic society.10 they were required to be 40 years of age or
older, to have a current smoking history of more than
10 pack-years and to report dyspnea when walking
quietly on level ground and chronic cough with sputum production on most days during at least three
consecutive months in two consecutive years. patients
had a fev1 28–61% of predicted values after longacting bronchodilator drugs had been withheld for
24 h and short-acting drugs withheld for 12 h. a
bronchodilator response prior to entry into the study
was not required. patients with a history of asthma,
allergic rhinitis, atopy, skin-test positivity or and/or
with a total blood eosinophil count over 400/mm3
were excluded. unstable respiratory disease requiring
oral/parenteral corticosteroids within the 4 weeks
prior to commencing the study, upper or lower respiratory tract infection within the 4 weeks of screening
visit, concurrent use of medications that aﬀect copd,
evidence of alcohol abuse were other exclusion criteria.
table 1 outlines the baseline characteristics of the
population studied.
the study, which was carried out according to the
rules of the declaration of helsinki, was performed
using a double-blind, cross-over, randomized design.
the bronchodilator activity of 40 mg oral  xxxd3545xxx 
and oral placebo was investigated on two non-consecutive days, at least 1 week apart. no oral bronchodilators were permitted for 1 week before and during
the study. while inhaled short-acting bronchodilator
drugs and inhaled long-acting bronchodilator agents
were not permitted for at least 12 h and 24 h prior to
each test, respectively. patients were also asked to
refrain from consumption of cola drinks, coﬀee, tea,

and smoking in the 12 h before and during the investigation.
spirometry was performed according to the procedures described in the american thoracic society’s
1987 update.11 three acceptable forced expiratory
manoeuvres were performed in order to obtain two
reproducible results for fvc and fev1. the higher
of the two fev1, results was kept for analysis. measurements were performed immediately before drug
administration and 30, 60, 120, 180, 240 min thereafter. at the end of the 4-h period, each patient
received 400 g inhaled salbutamol and spirometric
testing was performed 30 min later.
increases in the functional indices from baseline
after  xxxd3545xxx  and placebo were assessed. the
change in fev1 was chosen as the primary outcome
variable to demonstrate bronchodilation.12 as an expression of the total eﬀect of each treatment, the areas
under the fev1 response-time curves (auc) from
baseline to 4 h were determined for each patient using
the trapezoidal rule. comparisons of baseline characteristics among the four groups were performed by
anova analysis and fisher’s exact test. analysis of
spirometric data were performed using the student’s
t-test for paired variables. the time-averaged changes
in the 4 h after drug administration between  xxxd3545xxx 
and placebo were compared by means of the distribution free cross-over analysis.13 with respect to
the multiple testing of two lung function parameters,
a significance level of 0.05 was considered as relevant.
we underline that sample size calculations were not
conducted a priori because this was a pilot study.

discussion
the present study demonstrates that the cyslt1receptor antagonist  xxxd3545xxx  induces a moderate,
but significant bronchodilation in some smokers
suﬀering from copd, although this eﬀect might not
be seen in patients with more fixed airflow obstruction.
to our knowledge, this is the first study with cysteinyl
leukotriene antagonists that has demonstrated significant bronchodilatory action in patients with partially reversible copd.
several studies have established the capacity of
the cysteinyl leukotrienes to contract isolated human
airways14 or, when given by inhalation, to induce
airway obstruction in normal subjects.15–17 the cysteinyl leukotrienes are also potent bronchoconstrictors in subjects with asthma.18 unfortunately,
there is no evidence of a role of these mediators in
copd, although the presence of cysteinyl leukotrienes in sputum of patients with chronic bronchitis has been documented.7–9 in eﬀect, leukotrienes
were detected in sputum of patients with chronic
bronchitis, although analysis of sputum extracts
showed a four-fold increase in the level of ltb4,
compared to the cysteinyl-containing leukotrienes
(ltc4/ltd4).8
all these findings suggest that cysteinyl leukotrienes
might contribute to the bronchospasm in copd,
although there is no direct documentation for an
association between increased production of cysteinyl
leukotrienes and impaired respiratory function in
patients with copd. in any case, our data are an
indirect evidence of the possibility that basal airway
tone in some smokers with partially reversible copd
is influenced by endogenous cysteinyl leukotrienes and
may be responsible, at least in part, for persistent
bronchoconstriction.
the present study does not confirm the hypothesis
that the eﬀects of  xxxd3545xxx  and salbutamol are
independent and additive.1 in fact, the diﬀerence
between placebo and  xxxd3545xxx  was not significant
after inhaled salbutamol given 4 h after each treatment. it is possible that  xxxd3545xxx  had no acute
bronchodilation action additive to that of inhaled
salbutamol because the subjects studied in this
specific clinical situation, who were not asthmatics
but patients with partially reversible copd, were
at the top of their bronchodilation after inhalation
of the 2-agonist.
in conclusion, this study suggests that  xxxd3545xxx 
has an acute bronchodilating eﬀect in some smokers
suﬀering from copd and that cysteinyl leukotrienes
might contribute to the bronchospasm in these
patients. however, this eﬀect might not be seen in
patients with more fixed airflow obstruction. although  xxxd3545xxx  might have a place in the treatment of some patients with copd, more detailed

information about the functional consequences of
regular use of this drug, and, more important. the
role that cysteinyl leukotrienes may play in this
disease, is now needed.
