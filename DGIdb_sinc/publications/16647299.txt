hematopoietic progenitor cells (hpcs) represent an ideal target for gene therapy treatment of human
immunodeficiency virus (hiv) infection. however, gene delivery into quiescent hpcs by retroviral or
lentiviral vectors remains relatively poor. we evaluated a selection scheme based on the expression of
a variant of  xxxg1187xxx  ( xxxg1187xxx ), the rate-limiting enzyme in the de
novo purine biosynthesis pathway. as lymphocytes depend more than other cell types on de novo
synthesis of purines, impdh inhibitors such as  xxxd2678xxx  (mpa) can selectively expand
lymphocytes overexpressing the enzymes. we used hiv vectors to deliver an impdh variant into t
cells and hpcs. we showed that the transduced t cells became resistant to mpa selection. by
expressing a short hairpin rna gene targeted to the hiv gag transcript, the mpa-selected t cells
became resistant to hiv-1 infection. monocyte/macrophages derived from the transduced hpcs
differentiated normally and exhibited normal function as measured by b7 up-regulation and
phagocytosis when stimulated. our results suggest that this system may be applicable as a selection
strategy to enrich transduced t lymphocytes and mononuclear cells in vivo for hiv gene therapy.

introduction
low levels of genetically modified cells can prevail in vivo if
the modified cells have a selective advantage, as shown in
the case of gene therapy treatment of severe combined
immunodeficiency [1,2]. for disorders in which a naturally
occurring selective advantage does not exist, enforced in
vivo selection is one approach to increase the fraction of
genetically modified hematopoietic cells. one strategy is to
use a drug-resistant gene to enrich the transduced cells.
examples include variants of  xxxg631xxx 
(dhfr) [3,4], multiple drug resistance protein 1 ( xxxg10xxx )
[5], and variants of dna alkyltransferase such as methylguanine methyltransferase (mgmt) [6–10]. however, adult
cancer patients receiving  xxxg10xxx -transduced autologous
cd34+ cells followed by etoposide treatment showed no
enrichment for the transduced cells [11]. dhfr variants
confer resistance to methotrexate and  xxxd3442xxx

(tmtx), but these drugs do not exert selective pressure in
the stem cell compartment. although this limitation can
be overcome by combined treatment with tmtx and the
nucleoside transport inhibitor nitrobenzylmercaptopurine
riboside 5v-monophosphate [3], in vivo selection in a large
animal model achieved only transient selection [12].
mgmt protects cells by removing the dna adducts
induced by nitrosourea, such as bis-chloroethyl nitrosourea ( xxxd444xxx ) [13]. o 6-benzylguanine (bg) is frequently
used in combination with  xxxd444xxx  since bg acts by functionally inactivating endogenous mgmt. to facilitate the
selection strategy, mgmt variants that contain specific
amino acid substitutions conferring bg resistance were
used [14]. in murine serial transplantation studies, drug
treatment of animals transplanted with dhfr- or mgmttransduced cells demonstrated that selection occurred at
the level of hematopoietic progenitor cells (hpcs) [13].

however, selection with either system was also accompanied by a significant reduction in hpc numbers [15]. this
raises safety concerns as it could lead to hematopoietic
failure. due to the shortcomings of these approaches,
alternative selection strategies need to be developed.
we have evaluated a potential lymphocyte selection
scheme based on the expression of a variant of inosine
monophosphate dehydrogenase 2 ( xxxg1187xxx ), the ratelimiting enzyme in the de novo purine biosynthesis pathway [16]. impdh catalyzes the conversion of inosine
monophosphate (imp) to xanthosine monophosphate
[16]. humans have two impdh isoenzymes, termed type
1 and type 2, that are 84% identical at the amino acid level
and possess indistinguishable catalytic activities. since
proliferating lymphocytes depend more than other cell
types on de novo synthesis of purines, impdh inhibitors
such as  xxxd2678xxx  (mpa) and its prodrug  xxxd2677xxx  (mmf) can selectively inhibit lymphocyte proliferation and confer immunosuppression [16]. in
addition to the extensive clinical experience with mmf in
organ and bone marrow transplantation, mmf has been
used to supplement anti-hiv-1 chemotherapy because it
has a synergistic interaction with nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors [17–19]. the  xxxg1187xxx  variant we use
contains two mutations in the mpa binding site that lead
to a significantly increased resistance to mpa. in this
study, we used hiv vectors to deliver a small interfering
rna (sirna) gene targeted to hiv-1 together with this
 xxxg1187xxx  variant into t lymphocytes, peripheral blood
mononuclear cells (pbmcs), and cd34+ cells; optimized
the conditions for mpa selection; and characterized the
phenotypes of the transduced cells, including their ability
to secret cytokines upon stimulation and the ability of the
selected cells to inhibit hiv-1 replication. our results
suggest that this system may be applied as a selection
strategy to enrich transduced t cells in vivo.

results
 xxxg1187xxx  expression conferred mpa resistance to
t lymphocytes
to facilitate detection of the transduced t cells under
mpa selection, we fused the green fluorescent protein
(gfp) gene with the  xxxg1187xxx  variant to generate
 xxxg1187xxx -gfp (i-gfp). the gene encoding i-gfp was
controlled by the promoter derived from spleen focusforming virus (sffv), and we cloned it into a hiv vector
backbone to generate phiv7/i-gfp (fig. 1a). we also
constructed a second vector, phiv7/p24/i-gfp, containing an h1 promoter-driven short hairpin (sh) rna gene
specific for the hiv gag transcript. we generated these
vectors from 293t cells and used them to transduce
human t lymphocytes in this study. to serve as a
control, we generated and used the previously described
hiv7/sf-gfp [20] containing the gfp gene in this study.
to determine if mpa resistance could be demonstrated,

hiv7/i-gfp-transduced h9 cells increased from 81 to
99% and the gfp+ fraction of hiv7/p24/i-gfp-transduced cells increased from 45 to 94% (fig. 1b). serial
passaging of mpa-selected cells for up to 2 months
retained the same percentage of gfp+ cells in each
population (data not shown), suggesting that stable
expression of the  xxxg1187xxx –gfp fusion protein did not
affect cell proliferation. similarly, when pbmc-derived t
cells were analyzed by fluorescence-activated cell sorting
(facs), we noted that selection in 0.4 am mpa led to an
increase in the gfp+ cell fraction from 14 to 51% in
hiv7/i-gfp-transduced cells and from 26 to 60% in
hiv7/p24/i-gfp-transduced cells (fig. 1c).
escalation of the mpa concentration from 3.1 to 24.8
am had only minimal effect on the viability of hiv7/igfp-transduced and hiv7/p24/i-gfp-transduced h9 cells
(fig. 2a). in contrast, mock-transduced or hiv7/sf-gfptransduced h9 cells were eliminated by mpa at a concentration of 6.2 am. pbmcs were more sensitive than h9
cells to the selection, and 0.4 am mpa was sufficient to
eliminate mock-transduced or control vector-transduced
cells (fig. 2b). the hiv7/i-gfp-transduced and hiv7/p24/
i-gfp-transduced pbmcs were resistant to an mpa concentration as high as 3.1 am (fig. 2b). mpa-resistant
pbmcs expanded 251-fold during a period of 10 days in
selection, and more than 98% of these cells expressed
cd3 (data not shown), indicating that t cells were
selected by this procedure. these studies demonstrated

that  xxxg1187xxx  could serve as an effective drug selection
marker to enrich for transduced t cells in culture. in
addition, a wide range of mpa concentrations could be
used for such a selection process without significantly
affecting cell proliferation or viability (data not shown).
cytokine production from mpa-selected
t lymphocytes
to ensure that the mpa selection did not interfere with
normal t cell activities, we measured cytokine production from mpa-selected pbmcs upon stimulation with
antibodies against cd3 and cd28. for six cytokines
tested, mock- and vector-transduced cell populations
responded to stimulation with increased cytokine production (fig. 3). however, the cytokine responses were
generally lower in cells transduced with hiv7/p24/i-gfp.
this could be attributed to potential boff-targetq effects of
stable sirna expression in pbmcs [21]. however, given
the variability of the assay in healthy subjects [22], this
quantitative difference could be due to the small sample
size (four patients) we used in this assay. since pbmcs
used for this study were transduced and expanded in
culture for at least 1 month in the continuous presence of
mpa selection, these results demonstrated that cytokine
production from these pbmcs was not inhibited by the
selection procedure or by the stable expression of either
the i-gfp fusion protein or the p24 sirna.
i-gfp and shrna expression did not interfere with
the ability of cd34+ cells to differentiate in culture
hpcs represent the major target for the delivery of antihiv rnai genes. to ensure that p24 shrna or i-gfp
fusion protein expression does not interfere with hpc
differentiation, we transduced cord blood cd34+ cells
with the three vectors shown in fig. 1a and plated them
in  xxxd2609xxx . we scored colony formation and gfp
expression after 2 weeks. as shown in table 1, colonies
derived from bfu-e, cfu-gm, and cfu-gemm were
readily detectable. the fractions of gfp+ colonies in
hiv7/i-gfp- and hiv7/p24/i-gfp-transduced cells were
25 and 43%, respectively. as the fraction of gfp+ colonies
in hiv7/p24/i-gfp-transduced cells was similar to that in
hiv7/sf-gfp-transduced cells, we concluded that i-gfp
and shrna expression did not interfere with hematopoietic progenitor cell differentiation in this culture
system.
transduced cd34 progenitor cells can be differentiated into myelomonocytic cell lineages in liquid culture.
as shown in fig. 4a, we detected a significant fraction of
cd14+/gfp+ cells in liquid culture after a 3-week incubation of the transduced cd34+ cells in the presence of
 xxxg1177xxx  ( xxxg1177xxx ), il-6, and stem cell factor (scf).
hiv7/sf-gfp-transduced cells had the highest gfp mean
fluorescence intensity. this is consistent with our observation that hiv7/sf-gfp gave the highest mean fluorescence intensity in the ht1080 fibroblasts we used for

vector titering (data not shown). the lower gfp mean
fluorescence intensity derived from i-gfp could be due to
protein fusion that reduced gfp fluorescence. myelomonocytic differentiation of the transduced cells as evaluated for cd14 expression was not inhibited (41% for
hiv7/sf-gfp, 61% for hiv7/i-gfp, 53% for hiv7/p24/igfp). in comparison, 36% of mock-transduced cells
expressed cd14 (fig. 4a). we also pooled myeloid
colonies from the  xxxd2609xxx  and placed them in
cytokine-containing medium to differentiate these cells
further into mature macrophages. as shown in fig. 4b,
both nontransduced (nonshaded) and vector-transduced
(shaded) cells expressed similar levels of cd14, hla-dr,
cd4, ccr5, and cxcr4 on their surfaces. thus, normal
macrophage differentiation could occur in the presence
of i-gfp or shrna expression.
as a measure of erythroid differentiation, we held the
transduced cd34+ cells in liquid culture for 3 weeks in
the presence of scf and erythropoietin, followed by facs
analysis for glycophorin a expression. as shown in fig.

4c, we observed a significant fraction of glycophorin a+/
gfp+ erythroid cells. similar to myelomonocytic cells, the
fractions of the transduced erythroid cells with different
vectors were similar (75% for hiv7/sf-gfp, 79% for
hiv7/i-gfp, 62% for hiv7/p24/i-gfp, 75% for mock
control). in addition, we examined wright-stained slide
preparations microscopically and observed the presence
of reticulocyte and hemoglobinized erythrocytes (data
not shown). these results demonstrate that expression of
i-gfp and the p24 shrna did not interfere with the
ability of cord blood cd34+ cells to differentiate in
culture.
up-regulation of  xxxg396xxx  expression and
phagocytosis of macrophages derived from
transduced cd34+ cells
macrophages normally express low levels of b7 costimulatory molecules that present antigen to memory
and effector t cells. however, upon activation with
various stimuli, b7 in macrophages is up-regulated on

derived from the transduced cd34+ cells were functionally normal in up-regulating the b7 costimulatory
molecule, we stimulated the cells with lipopolysaccharide (lps) and analyzed them for  xxxg396xxx  expression by
facs. as shown in fig. 5, irrespective of the vector
used,  xxxg396xxx  expression was up-regulated in the transduced cells to levels similar to those in untransduced
cells.
integral to antigen presentation is the ability of
macrophages to phagocytose foreign material [24]. to
determine whether macrophages derived from the
transduced cd34+ cells are capable of normal phagocytosis, we mixed tetramethylrhodamine-conjugated
escherichia coli with the transduced cells and analyzed
the ingested bacteria by facs. as shown in fig. 6,
phagocytosis by the transduced macrophages was normal compared with the macrophages derived from

240

mock-transduced cd34 + cells. hela-derived magicxcr4 cells [25] served as nonphagocytic controls.
these results suggest that expression of the p24 shrna
and i-gfp did not interfere with hpc differentiation
and normal functions of the differentiated progenies in
culture.
inhibition of hiv-1 replication by p24 shrna in
mpa-selected t cells
to determine whether p24 shrna expression in mpaselected cells can confer resistance to hiv-1 replication,
we challenged mpa-resistant h9 cells and pbmcs transduced with either hiv7/i-gfp or hiv7/p24/i-gfp with
hiv-1nl4–3. as shown in fig. 7a, hiv7/p24/i-gfp transduced h9 cells inhibited hiv-1 replication by at least 5
orders of magnitude compared with hiv7/i-gfp or
mock-transduced cells. with the same challenge dose
as h9 cells, mpa-selected pbmcs transduced with hiv7/

stimulated by adding 5 ag/ml lipopolysaccharides (lps) to the culture. after 24 h, the cells were stained with pe–cy5-conjugated anti- xxxg396xxx  and analyzed by
facs.

p24/i-gfp also demonstrated a similar ability to inhibit
hiv-1 replication compared with mock- or hiv7/i-gfptransduced cells (fig. 7b). the emergence of the resistant
hiv-1 4 weeks after challenge was due to the selection of
hiv-1 mutants with nucleotide changes in the sirna
target site (data not shown). together, these results
suggested that the mpa selection process did not
interfere with the ability of t cells either to inhibit or
to support hiv-1 replication, depending on whether an
anti-hiv-1 shrna was expressed.

discussion
one challenge of gene therapy is how to transduce a
sufficient number of the target cells to produce a
therapeutic effect. in vivo drug selection addresses this
problem and potentially allows a low fraction of the
transduced cells to be expanded. this is most clearly
demonstrated by the delivery of mutant mgmt cdna
into mouse and canine models [6,26]. in both models,
cytotoxic drug treatment produced a significant and

cells were analyzed by facs for gfp-induced fluorescence or for tetramethylrhodamine-induced fluorescence, detectable in the  xxxd752xxx  channel as
phycoerythrin (pe). negative control cells are magi-cxcr4 cells transduced with hiv7/sf-gfp, which serve as nonphagocytic cells treated similarly, and

sustained multilineage increase in genetically modified
hpcs. however, the drug toxicities in bone marrow, liver,
and lung and a depletion of overall hpc number induced
by the mgmt selection scheme suggest that alternative
approaches to enrich the transduced cells in vivo should
be explored.
in the current study, we have evaluated the use of
 xxxg1187xxx  as a way to enrich directly for the transduced t
lymphocytes. the selection scheme based on this enzyme
used to treat hiv infection provides at least two advantages: first, it uses mpa and its prodrug mmf, a clinically
approved immunosuppressive drug, for the enrichment
of the transduced cells. this drug specifically suppresses
lymphocyte proliferation but has less effect on other
hematopoietic cell lineages. we confirmed this property
by showing that mpa had little effect on the survival of
 xxxd2609xxx  colonies consisting mostly of erythroid,
granulocytic, and monocytic cell lineages (data not
shown). second, mmf is an antiviral agent and has a
synergistic effect when combined with other nucleoside
analog inhibitors of reverse transcriptase to suppress hiv
replication. our study showed that  xxxg1187xxx -expressing t
cells survived a wide range of mpa selection with little

242

doi:10.1016/j.ymthe.2006.02.017

effect on cell proliferation. mpa-resistant cells continued
to respond to t cell stimulating signals and produce both
th1 and th2 types of cytokines. these studies showed
that hiv vector-mediated transfer of the mutant  xxxg1187xxx 
cdna could protect t lymphocytes in culture from the
toxic effects of mpa and thus provide a basis to use this
system for direct cell expansion in vivo.
the two amino acid changes that we introduced into
 xxxg1187xxx  were based on a study of selected mouse
neuroblastoma cells having increased resistance to mpa
[27]. the murine  xxxg1187xxx  enzyme isolated from one such
resistant cell line containing an alteration of threonine333 to isoleucine and serine-351 to tyrosine exhibited a
2400-fold increased k i for mpa. as the crystal structures
of  xxxg1187xxx  in complex with imp and mpa were solved
[28], it showed that the hydroxyl group of thr-333
formed hydrogen bonds with the c1 carbonyl oxygen
in mpa, whereas ser-351 did not contact mpa. a single
point mutation in thr-333 in  xxxg1187xxx  led to  xxxd3426xxx -fold
increase in k i for mpa, while the role that ser-351 plays in
mpa resistance remains unclear. to design a mutant that
has the least affinity for mpa, and that also allows for
more efficient selection, we chose to mutate the amino
acid at both positions. importantly, the t333i  xxxg1187xxx 
mutant still retained at least 30% of the catalytic activity
[28]. since ser-351 is not involved in the interaction with
the  xxxg1187xxx  enzymatic active site [28], the mutation is
not expected to alter the enzymatic activity significantly.
the ability of the mutated  xxxg1187xxx  to induce mpa
resistance in the transduced lymphocytes is consistent
with this prediction. the fact that the transduced cells
survived a wide range of mpa also reflected the extent of
the reduced affinity of this mutant enzyme toward mpa.
it has been shown before that primary lymphocytes
could be stimulated to proliferate with  xxxd2676xxx  and
anti-cd28 antibodies coimmobilized on beads [29]; it
remained unclear whether stable  xxxg1187xxx /shrna
expression or mpa selective pressure could alter the
ability of these cells to proliferate. a previous study had
demonstrated that transfection of an sirna directed to
hiv gag effectively inhibited hiv-1 replication in cell
culture [30]. we used an shrna form of this same rnai
since the hairpin structure appears to have improved
expression (data not shown). of note, even in the
presence of an otherwise lymphotoxic agent and with
expression of the double-stranded rna transgene, the
mpa-resistant lymphocytes retained many of their
physiological functions: the selected cells could expand
exponentially in culture, the expanded t cells were able
to mount a normal cytokine response when stimulated,
and they could support or inhibit hiv replication
depending on the absence or presence of the shrna
gene. the fusion protein, i-gfp, when expressed in
transduced cells, produces lower mean fluorescence
intensity of gfp than does the sf-gfp gene. except
for this, experimental data in our study indicate no

deleterious effect of the  xxxg1187xxx  expression on the
cellular systems evaluated here. although we have not
tested whether mpa selection affects polyclonal cell
growth, the study by levine et al. demonstrated that
prolonged culture of cd4 cells with the same cell
expansion scheme resulted in a diverse t cell repertoire
[29]. thus, it is likely that mpa selection plus cell
expansion may allow the production of polyclonal
populations of t cells with th1 and th2 phenotypes.
our studies in cd34+ cells demonstrated that i-gfp
and p24 shrna expression did not interfere with ex
vivo hpc differentiation and the differentiated myelomonocytic cells exhibited normal macrophage functions such as  xxxg396xxx  up-regulation and phagocytosis
upon stimulation. since no system that allows ex vivo
cd34+ cell differentiation into t cells is currently
available, the issue of whether hpc-derived t cells
can be selected by mpa needs to be addressed with in
vivo studies. direct in vivo selection of the transduced
lymphocytes with the  xxxg1187xxx  mutant represents a
new approach to enrich the transduced cell fraction.
unlike the selection of hpcs with mgmt,  xxxg1187xxx 
selection largely expands the lymphocyte fraction.
lineage-specific cell expansion could be further modulated by using t-cell-specific cis-regulatory sequences,
thereby increasing the safety of using such a strategy
for gene therapy against hiv infection. as t cells have
a definite life span in vivo, the persistence of the in vivo
mmf-selected lymphocytes remains to be determined.
the evaluation of this mmf application in vivo as a
strategy to achieve efficient selection of genetically
transduced cells remains to be addressed. ample
information on the dosing of this drug in both animal
models and human patients exists, and we are
currently exploring these issues in animal models.

sequence: 5v-tacggtacccaccggcggccgccaccatgagcaagggcgaggaactgttc-3v. and 5v-cagttcctcgcccttgctcattccaccgcctccgaaaagccgcttctcatc-3v. the pcr products of the
 xxxg1187xxx  and gfp genes were annealed and further amplified with the
downstream primer of the  xxxg1187xxx  cdna and the upstream primer of the
gfp gene. the pcr product was digested with kpni and hindiii and cloned
into pbluescript sk( ). the i-gfp gene was placed under the control of the
0.6-kb sffv promoter and cloned into phiv7 to generate phiv7/i-gfp. a 0.3kb fragment containing the p24 shrna gene linked to the h1 promoter was
inserted immediately upstream of the sffv promoter in phiv7/i-gfp and
generated phiv7/p24/i-gfp. construction of phiv7/sf-gfp has been
described previously [20].
cell lines and virus. 293t and ht1080 cells were maintained in highglucose (4.5 g/liter) dulbecco’s modified eagles’ medium (dmem)
supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (fbs), 2 mm glutamine,
and 100 mg/liter gentamicin. h9 cells were grown in rpmi 1640, 10%
fbs, 2 mm glutamine, and 100 mg/liter gentamicin. hiv vectors were
produced by transient transfection of 293t cells with each vector
construct, pcmv-hiv-1 and pcmv-g. vectors were harvested 40 h
after transfection and titered on ht1080 cells for gfp expression by
facs analysis. hiv-1nl4–3 was generated by transfection of pnl4-3 into
293t cells. the virus was harvested 40 h after transfection and titered
on hela-cd4-ltr-h-gal cells as described [25]. for hiv-1 challenge,
cells were infected in duplicate with hiv-1nl4–3 at an m.o.i. ranging
between 0.0002 and 0.02. the infected cells were continually passaged
twice weekly and the supernatants were collected for p24 detection
using an hiv-1 p24 antigen assay kit (beckman coulter, fullerton, ca,
usa).
transduction and mpa selection of h9 cells. h9 cells were transduced
with the indicated vector for 18 h at an m.o.i. of 1 to 4. the optimal
dose for mpa selection was predetermined by a dose–response curve
(data not shown). selection was initiated 6 days after transduction with
the indicated doses. cell enrichment was determined by facs of gfp+
cells and cell viability was determined by trypan blue exclusion
analysis.
transduction and mpa selection of pbmcs. pbmcs from healthy donors
were isolated by  xxxd3253xxx –hypaque (amersham biosciences, uppsala, sweden). to stimulate cell proliferation, 106 pbmcs were seeded onto a plate
coated with 50 ag/ml retronectin (biowhittaker, walkersville, md, usa).
dynabeads (dynal biotech llc, brown deer, wi, usa) coated with the
antibodies against cd3 and cd28 were added in the ratio of 3 beads/cell.
the cells were stimulated for 18 h in rpmi 1640 supplemented with 10%
fbs and 2 mm l-gutamine. this was followed by vector transduction for
16 h at an m.o.i. of 5. the transduced culture was maintained in rpmi
medium supplemented with 50 units/ml il-2 (r & d systems, minneapolis, mn, usa). the transduction efficiency was measured by facs after
day 5. selection with 0.41 am mpa began 6 days after transduction and
was maintained for 10 days.
cytokine production upon pbmc stimulation. to assay for cytokine
production, the cells were washed and restimulated for 24 h with
dynabeads coated with cd3/cd28 antibodies. culture supernatants
were collected immediately before restimulation and 24 h after.
cytokine production was measured by cytometric bead array assay
(cba; becton–dickinson, san jose, ca, usa) as described previously
[31,32].
cd34 transduction. cd34+ cells were isolated from umbilical cord
blood samples with the approval of the institutional review board and
the institutional biosafety committee of the city of hope national
medical center. about 5  104 to 1  105 cd34+ cells were transduced
with the indicated vector at an m.o.i. of 20 in 200 al of iscove’s
modified dulbecco’s medium (imdm) containing 15% bit9500 (stem
cell technology, inc., vancouver, bc, canada) supplemented with flt
3, scf, and  xxxg2282xxx  at 50/50/10 ng/ml (r & d) [20]. the
conditions used for cd34 cell differentiation into myelomonocytic and
erythroid lineages were described previously [20].

 xxxd2609xxx  colony formation from the transduced cd34+ cells. for
 xxxd2609xxx  colony formation, the transduced cd34+ cells were
plated in 0.9%  xxxd2609xxx  medium according to the manufacturer’s
instructions (stem cell technology) and incubated at 378c for 2 weeks.
the colonies were scored by morphology and gfp expression by
fluorescence microscopy.
differentiation of cd34+ cells derived from fetal liver into
macrophages. cd34+ hematopoietic progenitor cells were purified from
human fetal liver using monoclonal antibody-conjugated immunomagnetic beads (miltenyi biotech, auburn, ca, usa) [33]. cells were cultured
in imdm containing 10% fbs and 25 ng/ml of each of the cytokines  xxxg1177xxx ,
il-6, and scf. cells were transduced twice with the indicated hiv vectors.
to drive transduced cd34+ cells toward the myeloid lineage, cells were
differentiated in methocult medium (stem cell technology) for 12 days.
to derive monocytes/macrophages, the myeloid colonies were then
pooled and cultured in dmem containing 10% fbs and 25 ng/ml each
of the cytokines gm-csf and  xxxg524xxx  for 5 days. subsequent experiments
on phenotypic analysis,  xxxg396xxx  up-regulation, and phagocytosis were
performed on these in vitro-derived pure populations of mature macrophages as described below. monoclonal antibodies used for cell surface
markers were purchased from bd biosciences (san jose, ca, usa).
measurement of macrophage functions by b7 up-regulation and by
phagocytosis. to determine whether the transduced macrophages produced were able to mount a normal stimulatory response, lps (5 ag/ml)
was added to the macrophage cultures. twenty-four hours after stimulation, the cells were stained with phycoerythrin (pe)–cy5-conjugated
anti- xxxg396xxx  and analyzed for  xxxg396xxx  up-regulation by facs [34]. for
phagocytosis assay, both lps and tetramethylrhodamine-conjugated e.
coli (k12) bioparticles (invitrogen) at 5 ag/ml were added to the cell
culture. the cells were analyzed for gfp and tetramethylrhodamine,
which is detectable in the  xxxd752xxx  channel as pe in a flow cytometer
(beckman coulter epics xl) [34].
challenge by wild-type hiv-1. transduced t cells were seeded at 5  105
cells per well onto 24-well plates and infected with increasing amounts of
hiv-1nl4–3 from m.o.i. 0.0002 to m.o.i. 0.02 for 24 h. the infected cells
were continually passaged, and supernatant was collected twice weekly.
the levels of p24 in the supernatant were determined by the p24 antigen
assay kit (beckman coulter, fullerton, ca).
