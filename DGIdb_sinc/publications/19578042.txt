introduction
prostate cancer is the leading cause of cancer morbidity and mortality
in american men aged 55 years and older (1). as such, there is a great
need for its chemoprevention. the high incidence of prostate cancer
and the decades of preneoplasia during its development make it an
ideal target for chemoprevention (2). prostate carcinogenesis is a multistage process that begins with the initiation of normal prostate epithelium by a carcinogen followed by promotion to prostate
intraepithelial neoplasia and then subsequent progression to invasive
metastatic carcinoma (3). the promotion stage, with its longer duration, is ideal for chemoprevention (4).
epidemiologic data suggest that cancer mortality inversely correlates with selenium consumption (5). experimental studies in animals
indicate that supplementation with selenium, depending on the form
and at a dose well above the dietary requirement, can prevent cancer at
various sites (5–7). the trial carried out by clark et al. (8) suggests

selenium prevents cancer in some cases but fails to do so in others.
selenium’s failure in this respect may be due to the development
of resistance to its chemopreventive actions.  xxxd3298xxx 
induce a variety of cancer-preventive actions in tumor cells, but
these actions may be limited by the low concentrations of free
 xxxd3298xxx  able to reach cells from the plasma. therefore,
we have sought to identify the chemopreventive action requiring
the lowest concentration of the redox-active form of selenium,
methylseleninic acid (msa). at submicromolar concentrations,
msa inhibited the malignant transformation of rwpe-1 prostate
epithelial cells. in contrast, in already transformed prostate cancer cells, selenium in the micromolar range was required to
inhibit cell growth and invasion and to induce apoptosis. the role
of protein kinase c (pkc) in these cellular processes, especially
the moderately selenium-sensitive pkce, was demonstrated using
pkc-specific inhibitors and small interfering rna. pkce levels
inversely correlated with cellular sensitivity to msa. an overexpression of pkce minimized msa-induced inhibition of
rwpe-1 cell transformation and induction of apoptosis.  xxxg1826xxx  (tr), a selenoprotein, reversed the msa-induced
inactivation of pkc isoenzymes. high tr expression in advanced
prostate cancer cells correlated with resistance to msa. furthermore, inhibition of tr by its specific inhibitor,  xxxd248xxx , resulted
in increased sensitivity of prostate cancer cells to msa. collectively, these results suggest that the cancer-preventive actions of
selenium may be negated both by an over-expression of pkce,
which is a redox-sensitive target for msa, and by the selenoprotein tr, which reverses pkc sulfhydryl redox modification.

that selenized yeast may reduce both the incidence of and mortality
associated with prostate, lung and colorectal cancers, but not cancers
of the breast and skin. however, the recent selenium and  xxxd3521xxx 
cancer prevention trial did not support the efficacy of  xxxd3187xxx  in the prevention of prostate cancer (9). thus, it is important to
elucidate the mechanism of action of selenium in order to understand
why selenium appears to prevent cancer in some cases but fails to do
so in others. the development of resistance to the actions of chemotherapeutic agents is a well-known phenomenon. whether resistance
develops to the cancer-preventive actions of selenium remains to be
determined.
previous elegant studies have demonstrated selenium-induced inhibition of tumor cell growth and induction of apoptosis (10,11), which
are considered to be important mechanisms of selenium’s cancerpreventive actions. these actions require micromolar concentrations
of selenium. however, at cancer-preventive doses, the majority of
selenium in circulation is present as selenoproteins or is bound to
proteins, and only a limited amount of selenium (,3%) is present as
low-molecular weight  xxxd3298xxx  (12,13). in this context, it is
noteworthy to mention that the concentration of selenium required for
in vitro inhibition of tumor promotion is in the submicromolar range
and is lower than that required for growth inhibition or apoptosis
of established malignant cells (14,15). nevertheless, these growthinhibiting and apoptosis-inducing mechanisms are also important in
the tumor promotion stage, in which there is a clonal expansion of
preneoplastic cells.
protein kinase c (pkc) is a potential target involved in both tumor
promotion and progression (16,17). therefore, it is possible that chemopreventive agents such as selenium act on pkc just as tumor
promoters do but induce an opposing response (18). in this scenario,
the cancer-preventive agent efficiently counteracts the tumor
promoter-induced effects on pkc. direct acting  xxxd3298xxx 
inactivate pkc isoenzymes by inducing the oxidative modification
of pkc at its cysteine-rich regions, an action which is reversed by
a reductase system involving  xxxg1826xxx  (tr), a selenoprotein (19). therefore, the degree of expression of pkc within a cell as
well as the ratio of intracellular  xxxd3298xxx  to tr, particularly
in the vicinity of pkc, may determine cellular response to selenium.
when methylseleninic acid (msa) is generated within the vicinity of
pkc, it specifically inactivates pkc isoenzymes (19). moreover,
an over-expression of pkce, an oncogenic, pro-survival and promitogenic isoenzyme, resulted in a relative resistance to seleniuminduced apoptosis in du145 advanced prostate cancer cells (19).
however, it remains unknown whether there is any difference in the
distribution of pkce in pre-cancer and early stage cancer cells showing variable degrees of sensitivity to selenium.
immortalized human prostate epithelial cells (rwpe-1) provide an
excellent model for studying in vitro transformation and biochemical changes at various stages of carcinogenesis (20,21). these nontumorigenic cells do not grow in soft agar; however, upon initiation
with  xxxd2685xxx  (mnu), they transform and form
colonies in soft agar (22). previous elegant studies of cancer chemoprevention have utilized rwpe-1 cells and the cancer cell lines
derived from it (23).
in this study, we show that submicromolar concentrations of msa
inhibit the transformation of pre-malignant prostate epithelial cells,
but not the growth and invasion of already malignant cells at this low
concentration. additionally, we show the role of pkce in malignant
transformation as well as tumor cell growth and invasion. furthermore, we demonstrate that the over-expression of either pkce, a redox
target for msa, or tr, an enzyme which reverses pkc redox modification, could lead to development of resistance to the cancerpreventive actions of selenium.

materials and methods
chemicals
the msa used in these experiments was a kind gift from dr howard ganther,
university of wisconsin, madison, wi. aprotinin, leupeptin, pepstatin a, 5,5#dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) and 3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (mtt) were from sigma, st louis, mo.  xxxd2195xxx  (bim) and bim v were from alexis biochemicals, plymouth meeting,
pa.  xxxd248xxx  and [c-32p]atp (specific activity 20 ci/mmol) were from mp
biochemicals, irvine, ca. using a previously published procedure, we raised
rabbit polyclonal antibodies against pkce by injecting hemocyanin coupled
with sequence-specific peptide from the variable region in pkce (19). this
peptide and a pkc-specific substrate peptide that corresponds to a neurogranin
sequence (residues 25–43) were synthesized at the core facility of norris
comprehensive cancer center.

in vitro transformation and anchorage-independent growth in soft agar
rwpe-1 cells were seeded in six-well plates in complete ksfm at a density of
5  104 cells per well. after 1 day, cells were treated with mnu at a final
concentration of 50 lg/ml for 1 h. then cells were washed with hanks’  xxxd2988xxx  and maintained in complete ksfm. clonal expansion of
initiated rwpe-1 cells was promoted in soft agar by  xxxg681xxx 
(22). for soft agar growth, 2 ml of 0.6% agar in complete ksfm were placed in
35 mm petri dishes. one day after mnu treatment, rwpe-1 cells derived from
each well were seeded separately at 5  104 cells per 35 mm petri dish in 2 ml
of 0.3% agar over the bottom agar layer in complete ksfm and then incubated
in a cell culture incubator. on days 9 and 18, 1 ml of 0.3% agar in complete
ksfm with or without msa was added. after 28 days, colonies consisting of
.20 cells were counted.
isolation of transformed prostate cancer cell line (rw-m)
from a rapidly growing colony of rwpe-1 mnu transformants in soft agar,
cells were isolated and allowed to grow in an anchorage-dependent manner.
these cells were again subjected to soft agar growth and the rapidly growing
cells were isolated. this process of selection was repeated two more times. the
transformed cell line thus isolated was referred to as rw-m (m denotes mnu).
the soft agar growth and matrigel invasion of rw-m cells are higher than that
of rwpe-1 untransformed cells, but they are lower than those of highly
malignant du145 cells. the rw-m-transformed cell line maintained its
intermediate malignant phenotypic properties such as growth in soft agar
and matrigel invasion even after several passages in cell culture.
pkc assay
cells were treated with msa and then homogenized in buffer (20 mm
tris–hcl, ph 7.4, 1 mm ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 150 nm pepstatin a, and 1% igepal ca-630). unless
otherwise indicated, mercapto compounds were omitted from all the buffers
used for cell homogenization and chromatographic isolation of pkc. the cell
extracts were subjected to diethylaminoethyl-cellulose chromatography as described previously (24). the assay of pkc was carried out in 96-well plates
(24). briefly, pkc reaction samples containing 20 mm tris–hcl (ph 7.4),
10 mm mgcl2, 0.33 mm cacl2, 0.1 mm [c-32p]atp (3 million c.p.m.),
5 lm neurogranin substrate polypeptide (residues 25–43), 40 lm leupeptin
and 25 ll of pkc sample in a total volume of 125 ll were incubated for 5 min
at 30°c. the reaction was arrested with 10 ll of 1 m phosphoric acid, the
samples were applied to whatman  xxxg740xxx  paper (2  2 cm) and the papers were
washed four times with 75 mm phosphoric acid. radioactivity retained in the
washed paper was counted. the basal activity observed in the absence of
cofactors was subtracted from the activity observed in the presence of cofactors. the difference was expressed as pkc activity in units, where 1 u enzyme
transfers 1 nmol of phosphate to neurogranin polypeptide per minute at 30°c.

stable transfection of pkce
the metallothionein expression vector (25) used in these experiments was
a kind gift from dr wayne anderson, national cancer institute, bethesda,
md. the cells were transfected with either a metallothionein-driven pkce
expression vector (to over-express pkce) or an empty vector (as a control)
using lipofectamine 2000 according to the manufacturer’s recommended
procedure. one day after transfection, rwpe-1 cells were plated at a lower
density and grown in a selection medium containing 450 lg/ml  xxxg418xxx . after
4 weeks in the selection medium, single colonies were picked, expanded and
screened for the presence of pkce by using western blot analysis.
transient transfection of rw-m cells with pkce small interfering rna
rw-m cells were plated in a six-well plate. after 24 h, 50 nm pkce small
interfering rna (sirna) oligonucleotides (three pre-designed silencer oligonucleotides from ambion, austin, tx) were transfected into rw-m cells with
lipofectamine 2000 according to the manufacturer’s instructions. as a negative
control, we used scrambled sirna that did not exhibit homology to any encoding region but had similar guanine and cytosine content. the experiments were
continued with the pkce sirna oligonucleotide producing the greatest knockout (a decrease of 70–80% from the control).
tr assay
tr activity was determined using an insulin–thioredoxin method (26). sulfhydryls released from insulin were determined by 5,5#-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid)
and the absorbance of the nitrothiobenzoic acid was measured at 405 nm. this
method was modified to suit 96-well plates. one unit of the enzyme produces
one absorbance at 405 nm/min.
anchorage-dependent cell growth assay
cells grown in 96-well plates were treated with various concentrations of msa
for 48 h. then, cells were fixed in 10% trichloroacetic acid. after washing
them with water, the cells were stained with a 0.4% solution of sulforhodamine
b for 30 min. the excess dye was removed by washing the cells with 1% acetic
acid, and the dye bound to the cells was later dissolved in 10 mm  xxxd3449xxx . the
absorbance was read at 550 nm as a growth index (27).
cell viability assay
we determined the cytotoxicity of msa using the mtt reduction assay.
initially, cells were grown in 96-well plates and treated with msa for 24 h.
then, an mtt solution (5 mg/ml) in hanks’  xxxd2988xxx  was added,
and the plates were incubated for 4 h. the formazan formed was dissolved in
dimethylsulfoxide, and the absorbance was read at 550 nm (28).
apoptosis assay
to assess morphological changes in the chromatin structure of cells undergoing apoptosis, cells were stained with 4#,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (dapi).
cells were grown on culture slides, treated with msa for 24 h and then fixed
with 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline for 20 min at room
temperature. after rinsing them with phosphate-buffered saline, cells were
stained with dapi (10 lg/ml) for 5 min. the morphology of the nuclei was
observed using a fluorescence microscope (nikon eclipse te300) at an excitation wavelength of 345 nm. apoptotic nuclei were identified by chromatin
condensation and fragmentation. the incidence of apoptosis in each preparation was analyzed by counting 500 cells and determining the percentage of
apoptotic nuclei (29).
caspase-3 assay
enzyme activity was determined by using tetrapeptide substrate (n-acetylasp-glu-val-asp-p-nitroanilide) with an assay kit obtained from biomol
(plymouth meeting, pa). cells were seeded in 100 mm petri dishes and
allowed to grow for 24 h. the cells were treated with various concentrations
of msa for 24 h. then, the treated cells were homogenized, and caspase-3
activity was determined according to the manufacturer’s instructions.

cell culture and treatments
the rwpe-1 cell line used in this study was kindly provided by dr mukta
webber, university of michigan, east lansing, mi. rwpe-1 cells were maintained in complete keratinocyte-serum-free medium (ksfm) containing bovine
pituitary extract (50 lg/ml),  xxxg681xxx  (5 ng/ml) and 1% antibiotic
and antimycotic mixture (penicillin 100 u/ml, streptomycin 100 lg/ml and
 xxxd164xxx  0.25 lg/ml). androgen-independent du145 prostate carcinoma cells
were obtained from the american type culture collection and maintained in
eagle’s minimum essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum.
msa was diluted in hanks’  xxxd2988xxx  and added to the culture
medium. mnu was dissolved in ethanol and used immediately. when agents
were dissolved in organic solvents, appropriate solvent controls were used.

western immunoblotting for pkce isoenzyme
cell extracts were subjected to  xxxd3215xxx –polyacrylamide gel
electrophoresis. electrophoretically separated proteins were transferred to
a polyvinylidene fluoride membrane. the membranes were blocked with 5%
dry milk and subsequently incubated with pkce isoenzyme-specific primary
antibodies followed by goat anti-rabbit secondary antibodies conjugated with
horseradish peroxidase. the immunoreactive bands were visualized by the
enhanced chemiluminescence western blot detection kit (pierce, rockford,
il). these bands were analyzed by densitometric scanning using the omega
12 ic molecular imaging system and ultraquant software.

resistance to the cancer-preventive actions of selenium

cell invasion assay
approximately 100 lg of reconstituted basement membrane (matrigel) was
used to coat polycarbonate filters (8 lm, pore size) fitted in transwell inserts
(costar, cambridge, ma). prostate cancer cells were grown to confluency and
detached by brief trypsinization, and 200 000 cells were added to a transwell
insert in minimum essential medium supplemented with 0.1% fetal calf serum.
in the lower well, 1% fetal calf serum was added as a chemoattractant. after 24
h, the cells that invaded the lower chamber were counted (30).

fig. 1. msa-induced inhibition of anchorage-independent growth of
prostate cells in soft agar. initially, rwpe-1 cells were treated with mnu
(50 lg/ml) for 1 h. the mnu-treated rwpe-1 cells (50 000), rw-m cells
(5000) or du145 cells (5000) were suspended in 0.3% agar in complete
ksfm along with the indicated concentrations of msa. this suspension was
layered over the top of 0.6% agar containing the same concentrations of
msa in complete ksfm in 35 mm petri dishes and incubated in a cell
culture incubator. after 28 days, colonies consisting of .20 cells were
counted. the mean number of colonies formed in the absence of msa for
rwpe-1 (mnu treated), rw-m and du145 cells were 94, 123 and 228,
respectively. these values were expressed as 100%. the data are
means ± standard errors of three experiments.

effect of pkc inhibitors on the clonal expansion of mnu-initiated
cells
first, it is important to establish a causal role of pkc isoenzymes in
prostate cell transformation before evaluating pkc as a molecular
target for selenium in preventing prostate cell transformation. we
assessed the role of pkc in cell transformation by using three cellpermeable pkc-specific inhibitors, each acting by a different mechanism. calphostin c is a pkc-specific inhibitor that irreversibly
inactivates pkc by binding to the regulatory domain (34). chelerythrine is an irreversible inactivator of pkc and covalently binds to
cysteine residues at the catalytic site (34). bim was used at low
(100 nm) and high (2 lm) concentrations to preferentially inhibit
a subset of pkc isoenzymes.
both calphostin c (100 nm) and chelerythrine (2 lm) substantially
decreased colony formation of mnu-initiated rwpe-1 cells in soft
agar (figure 3a). this supports a critical role for pkc in prostate cell
transformation. bim at 100 nm concentration partially inhibited cell
transformation. since bim is a highly potent inhibitor for conventional pkc isoenzymes with an ic50 of 10 nm (35), a partial
inhibition of cell transformation suggests the role of conventional
pkc isoenzymes in rwpe-1 cell transformation. however, a lack
of complete inhibition even at 100 nm (a 10-fold higher than ic50)
suggests the involvement of other pkc isoenzymes as well whose
inhibition requires higher concentration of bim. since bim inhibits
novel pkc isoenzymes (d and e) with lower affinity (ic50 0.2 lm),
we tested whether bim at a higher (2 lm) concentration inhibits cell

enhanced sensitivity of promoting cells to msa
for this study, we used msa, an oxidation product of methylselenol
that has been postulated to mediate the cancer-preventive actions of
selenium (6,31). a recent study has revealed superior in vivo inhibitory efficacy of msa against prostate cancer over  xxxd3187xxx 
or selenite (32). considering that only limited amounts of free  xxxd3298xxx  are available to tissues from the plasma, we have compared the relative sensitivity of cell transformation, cell growth, cell
invasion and apoptosis to msa in order to identify which of the
processes is more susceptible to selenium. since the precise intracellular concentration of low-molecular weight  xxxd3298xxx  is not
known, we have considered msa effects occurring at submicromolar
concentrations to be sensitive ones and the effects occurring in the
micromolar range to be relatively resistant ones. msa completely
inhibited mnu-initiated transformation of rwpe-1 cells with
a 50% inhibitory concentration (ic50) of 0.35 lm (figure 1). this
concentration of msa was significantly lower than that required for
the inhibition of soft agar growth of already transformed prostate
cancer cells (rw-m), which was in the low micromolar range. similarly, inhibition of anchorage-independent (soft agar) growth of other
prostate cancer cells, such as du145, required micromolar concentrations of msa (figure 1). the greater sensitivity of rwpe-1 cell
transformation to msa is either due to the process of transformation
itself being more sensitive to selenium or the initiated rwpe-1 cells
being more susceptible to selenium-induced growth inhibition in soft
agar. since rwpe-1 cells cannot grow in soft agar, it is difficult to

determine whether anchorage-independent growth of rwpe-1 cells is
more sensitive to msa. therefore, another set of experiments was
performed in which anchorage-dependent growth was compared
among the three cell types.
for comparison of msa sensitivity, all these three cell lines were
switched to complete ksfm medium so that the differences in
medium constituents would not influence cell sensitivity to msa.
anchorage-dependent growth was measured by sulforhodamine
b assay. rwpe-1 cells (not mnu treated) were most susceptible to
msa-induced growth inhibition with an ic50 of 0.75 lm (figure 2a).
this was followed by rw-m cells (ic50 5 1.5 lm), which were more
susceptible to msa than du145 cells (ic50 5 2 lm).
cytotoxicity and cell viability of msa-treated cells were determined by an mtt assay (28). as shown in figure 2b, msa decreased
the viability of these cells to a variable extent. again, rwpe-1 cells
were most sensitive to msa-induced cytotoxicity, followed by rw-m
cells and du145 cells. next, we assessed whether the loss of viability
induced by msa correlated with the induction of apoptosis, a common
property of many cancer-preventive agents (33). apoptosis was
determined by identifying chromatin condensation and fragmentation
after dapi staining (29). at a low concentration (,1 lm), msa
induced apoptosis to an appreciable extent in rwpe-1 cells, whereas
a high concentration (.1 lm) was required to induce apoptosis in
rw-m cells and du145 cells (figure 2c). under these conditions, the
activation of caspase-3 correlated well with the observed apoptosis by
dapi staining method (figure 2d). collectively, these results suggest
that rwpe-1 cells and intermediate rw-m cells are more sensitive to
the cytotoxic effect of msa than highly malignant du145 cells.
invasion is the hallmark of malignancy. therefore, we measured the
invasive ability of these cell types in vitro. parent rwpe-1 cells did
not show matrigel invasion. however, rw-m-transformed cells,
derived from rwpe-1 cells, showed invasion of nearly 55% that of
the highly malignant du145 cell line. msa inhibited matrigel
invasion in both cell types (figure 2d). however, the invasion of
rw-m cells was more sensitive to msa than that of du145 cells.
in our studies,  xxxd3187xxx  at low (1–10 lm) concentrations
did not produce any significant effect on cell transformation, apoptosis or invasion. this is not an unexpected finding, as  xxxd3187xxx 
requires metabolism into methylselenol for efficacy, a process that
may be slow in cells in culture.

transformation. at this concentration, bim further inhibited colony
formation in soft agar. in order to exclude the possibility of nonspecific inhibition of other enzymes by bim at a high (2 lm)
concentration, we used its inactive analogue bim v (2 lm) as a negative control. this inactive analogue did not inhibit rwpe-1 cell
transformation. since bim poorly inhibits pkcf with a high ic50
of 5 lm, it is unlikely that pkcf plays a key role in rwpe-1
prostate cell transformation. these observations support the role of

over-expression of pkce decreases cellular sensitivity to msa
to evaluate the role of pkce as a cellular resistance factor to msa,
we determined whether elevation of its levels inhibits the cancerpreventive actions of msa. pkce was transfected into rwpe-1 cells
and then the sensitivity of these cell lines to msa was evaluated. as
shown in figure 4b, rwpe-1 cells transfected with pkce showed
enhanced transformation as judged by growth in soft agar compared
with the control cells transfected with an empty vector. furthermore,
the concentration of msa needed to inhibit rwpe-1 cell transformation increased by nearly 10-fold after transfection with pkce. control
rwpe-1 cells transfected with empty vector did not show resistance
to msa. thus, with over-expression of pkce, a resistance was
developed to msa-induced inhibition of cell transformation. furthermore, over-expression of pkce in rwpe-1 cells also led to resistance
of msa-induced apoptosis (figure 4c). similarly, an over-expression
of pkce in the moderately msa-sensitive rw-m cell line resulted in
a decrease in sensitivity to msa-induced inhibition of cell growth and
induction of apoptosis (figure 4d, e and f). these results suggest that
pkce over-expression during tumor progression makes prostate
cancer cells less sensitive to the cancer-preventive actions of msa.

inverse relationship between tr activity and cellular sensitivity to
msa
given that the tr system can reverse msa-induced modification of
purified pkc (19), its intracellular over-expression may counteract
those of selenium’s actions that are caused by selenium-induced pkc
inactivation. therefore, we determined the activity of this reductase in
prostate cells. as shown in figure 5a, tr activity was low in rwpe-1
cells, intermediate in rw-m cells and high in du145 cells, inversely
correlating with their relative sensitivity to msa. furthermore, msa
induced tr activity in rwpe-1, rw-m and du145 cells by 1.1-, 1.9and 2.7-fold, respectively, from their base level.

 xxxg1839xxx  isoenzymes. pkce can induce the aggressive behavior of
tumors and is involved in invasion of tumor cells (36). therefore,
we determined the role of this pkc isoenzyme in tumor cell invasion
by using an sirna approach. rw-m cells transfected with pkce
sirna, exhibiting a decrease of .70% in pkce, showed a substantial
decrease in invasion. scrambled sirna did not cause a significant
decrease in invasion, suggesting the involvement of pkce in this
process.

tr counteracts msa-induced pkc inactivation and cellular actions
when rwpe-1 and rw-m cells were treated with msa, a substantial
decrease in the activity of pkc (all isoenzymes) occurred within
5–15 min, which then partially recovered over a 90 min time period
to a level still below that of the control (figure 5b and c). the extent
of inactivation of pkc inversely correlated with tr distribution, suggesting that tr may be reversing the msa-mediated inactivation of
pkc. to assess the role of tr in intact cells, we have used  xxxd248xxx ,
a potent specific inhibitor of tr (ic50 5 20 nm). a nearly 1000-fold
higher concentration of  xxxd248xxx  is required to inhibit other selenoenzymes such as glutathione peroxidase and sulfhydryl enzymes such as
 xxxg981xxx  and pkc (37). thus, it is likely that only tr is
inhibited in cells treated with the limited concentration of  xxxd248xxx 
(25–100 nm) used in this study. since the tr system reverses the
msa-induced redox modification of purified pkc (19), we used  xxxd248xxx  to determine whether tr system blockade enhances pkc
inactivation by msa in intact cells. as shown in figure 5b and c,
 xxxd248xxx  pre-treatment increased msa-induced inactivation of pkc
and minimized its reversal, suggesting that tr can reverse msainduced pkc inactivation.
in addition to increasing msa-induced inactivation of pkc in
intact cells,  xxxd248xxx  enhanced the cancer-preventive actions of
selenium. as shown in figure 6a,  xxxd248xxx  co-treatment resulted
in a reduction in the concentration of msa required to inhibit

inverse relationship between distribution of pkce and cellular
sensitivity to msa
since pkce is an oncogenic, pro-mitogenic and pro-survival enzyme
(36), we determined its intracellular levels by western immunoblotting to evaluate whether the intracellular levels of this isoenzyme
correlate with cellular sensitivity to msa. as shown in figure 4a,
pkce was low in rwpe-1 cells, intermediate in rw-m cells and high
in du145 cells, inversely correlating with their relative sensitivity to
msa.

rw-m cell growth. similarly,  xxxd248xxx  sensitized rw-m cells to
msa-mediated induction of apoptosis (figure 6b). collectively, these
results suggest that tr expression can counteract msa action and can
negate the cancer-preventive actions of selenium in tumor cells.
discussion
the following key points emerge from this study. first, based on the
results of our study, it is clear that clonally expanding initiated cells
(promotion) are likely to be the most sensitive to selenium’s action,
followed by early stage tumor cells and finally by advanced
tumor cells. after administration of cancer-preventive doses of  xxxd3187xxx , the majority of selenium in circulation is present in
selenoproteins and albumin and ,3% of selenium exists in the low-

1558

molecular weight form in the plasma (12,13). in humans supplemented with selenized yeast (200 lg selenium per day), total plasma
concentration of selenium reaches levels of 200 ng/ml that corresponds to a 2.5 lm (38). therefore, it is likely that under these
conditions, plasma concentrations of low-molecular weight selenium
are exceedingly low (,1 lm). furthermore, the methylated selenometabolites, methylselenol and dimethylselenide are volatile and
unlikely to accumulate in high amounts in tissues. therefore, only
cellular processes that are highly sensitive to selenium are likely to be
blocked by selenium supplementation. although at high concentration selenium kills advanced tumor cells in culture, the selenium
supplementation in a canine model indicated an intriguing u-shaped
dose–response relationship between selenium status and the extent of
dna damage within the prostate (39).

fig. 4. (a) western immunoblotting of pkce in prostate cells (du145, rw-m and rwpe-1) and rwpe-1 cells stably transfected with either a control vector or
a metallothioneine-driven expression vector. b-actin as the loading control was carried out. the band density of pkce in each sample was quantitated by
densitometry and expressed considering the band density of du145 cells as one. (b) resistance of rwpe-1 cells over-expressing pkce to msa-induced
inhibition of cell transformation. growth in soft agar was compared between mnu-treated rwpe-1 cells transfected with pkce vector and mnu-treated
rwpe-1 cells transfected with control vector. in the absence of msa, the mean values of colonies formed for these two cell types were 164 and 89, respectively.
these values were expressed as 100%. (c) resistance of rwpe-1 cells over-expressing pkce to msa-induced apoptosis. apoptosis was measured by identifying
chromatin condensation and fragmentation after dapi staining. (d) western immunoblotting of pkce in rw-m cells, rw-m cells transfected with control vector
and rw-m cells transfected with pkce vector. the band density was expressed considering the band density of rw-m as one. (e) resistance of rw-m cells overexpressing pkce to msa-induced cell growth inhibition. anchorage-dependent cell growth was determined as described in materials and methods. (f) resistance
of rw-m cells over-expressing pkce to msa-induced apoptosis. the results obtained with the control cells transfected with empty vector are not significantly
different from that of the wild-type control cells. therefore, the results obtained with wild-type cells were not shown in (b, c, e and f). for (e), the values are the
mean ± standard error of eight replicate estimations. for (b, c and f), the values are the mean ± standard error of three experiments.

fig. 6. (a) inhibition of tr in rw-m cells enhances their sensitivity to

culture plates, and after 24 h, cells were treated with indicated concentrations

treated with tr-specific inhibitor  xxxd248xxx  (100 nm) or vehicle (ethanol) for
1 h and then treated with msa (5 lm) for the indicated time periods. cells
were homogenized and total pkc isoenzymes were extracted from both the
cytosol and membrane and subjected to diethylaminoethyl-cellulose
chromatography (24). pkc activity was determined using neurogranin
peptide as a substrate. the values are the mean ± standard error of triplicate
estimations.

 xxxd3187xxx  was detected in trace quantities in the prostate
(40). moreover, various pre-clinical models of prostate cancer did not
support any in vivo anticancer activity of  xxxd3187xxx  (32).
therefore, it has been argued that  xxxd3187xxx  was an inappropriate choice for selenium and  xxxd3521xxx  cancer prevention trial,
which did not support the efficacy of selenium in the prevention of
prostate cancer (9).  xxxd3187xxx  non-specifically incorporates
into proteins (6). in addition, it needs to be metabolized to methylselenol to exert its cancer-preventive effects, which may be a limiting
factor.
second, the current studies have shown that rwpe-1 cells are more
sensitive to msa than prostate cancer cells. previous studies also have

shown that rwpe-1 cells are more sensitive to selenite than lncap
and  xxxg1682xxx  prostate cancer cell lines (41). although the conditions used
in our study and in others are different, rwpe-1 cells have consistently shown a higher sensitivity to selenium. conversely, few studies
have shown resistance of normal prostate cells to selenium (42).
although rwpe-1 cells possess some features resembling normal
prostate epithelial cells such as lack of growth in soft agar or nude
mice and lack of matrigel invasion, they are immortalized by papillomavirus 18, a postulated etiologic factor involved in prostate carcinogenesis (21). despite rwpe-1 cells being widely used as normal
cells, they are likely to be already partially initiated even prior
to treatment with mnu. mnu-initiated or promoted rwpe-1 cells
are then likely to be even more sensitive than parent rwpe-1 cells to
msa.
third, selenium may encounter a resistance mechanism to its
cancer-preventive actions. such counteractive resistance may be present in pre-cancer and tumor cells constitutively or induced as a cellular
adaptive response to selenium’s actions. elevated levels of redox
target pkce, which is modified at its sulfhydryls by selenium, and
elevated levels of selenoprotein tr, the enzyme that reverses this
modification, may be involved, at least in part, in the counteractive
mechanisms to selenium’s cancer-preventive actions. pkce, an oncogenic, pro-mitogenic and pro-survival enzyme, is involved in tumor
cell invasion (36). this isoenzyme is moderately sensitive to
msa (19). an over-expression of this enzyme in rwpe-1 cells
caused a loss of their sensitivity to selenium. selenoproteins as

antioxidants may oppose the actions of redox-active  xxxd3298xxx , which are pro-oxidants. selenometabolites as pro-oxidants
produce free radicals and cause lipid peroxidation and dna damage
(43–45).  xxxd3298xxx  such as selenite produce  xxxd2298xxx  and lipid peroxides (43,45), which are removed by the selenoprotein glutathione peroxidase. similarly, selenometabolite-induced
protein thiol oxidation is reversed by tr (19). thus, selenium itself
induces its own adaptive cellular response to counteract its toxic
action.
besides selenium, a variety of cancer-preventive agents induce
oxidative stress in tumor cells resulting in cell death (46–48). induction of antioxidant enzymes such as tr is an adaptive response to cell
survival. thus, pre-cancer cells may escape from pro-oxidant cancerpreventive agents, especially when these agents are given at low doses
for many years. it has also been shown that tr inhibition may
enhance the ability of anticancer drugs to induce cell death (49).
furthermore, pkc may play a role in the induction of tr, suggesting
an interaction between these two enzymes that results in resistance to
selenium (50).
the resistance mechanisms we have proposed account for both the
success and failure of selenium as a cancer-preventive agent. understanding these mechanisms is also relevant to the study of other prooxidant chemopreventive agents such as  xxxd3521xxx ,  xxxd228xxx  and
 xxxd1979xxx  agents. within the class, selenium is an ideal model
for study as the molecular players (selenometabolites and selenoproteins) have been well characterized.
