abstract
the effects of g- xxxd2177xxx  (gaba) receptor modulators and gaba uptake inhibitors on volatile and intravenous anestheticinduced anesthesia were examined in male icr mice, as assessed by the loss of righting reflex (lorr). the gaba uptake inhibitors,
no-711 and skf89976a, which are permeable to the blood – brain barrier (bbb), but not nipecotic acid or  xxxd2248xxx , which poorly
permeate bbb, shortened the onset of lorr but did not affect the duration of lorr induced by 1.5% halothane and 2% isoflurane.
no-711 and skf89976a shortened the onset of and prolonged the duration of lorr induced by  xxxd3348xxx  (45 mg/kg ip). the gaba
mimetics, muscimol and diazepam, shortened the onset of and prolonged the duration of lorr induced by halothane, isoflurane, and
 xxxd3348xxx . on the other hand,  xxxd2947xxx , a gabaa receptor antagonist, prolonged the onset of lorr induced by all anesthetics tested.
another gabaa receptor antagonist, bicuculline, prolonged the onset of lorr induced by halothane, but not by isoflurane or
 xxxd3348xxx . both antagonists failed to affect the duration of lorr induced by halothane, isoflurane, or  xxxd3348xxx . baclofen, a gabab
receptor agonist, enhanced both volatile anesthetics- and  xxxd3348xxx -induced anesthesia. these results suggest that anesthesia induced
by volatile and intravenous anesthetics might be correlated with the modification of the pre- and/or postsynaptic gabaergic activities.

1. introduction
although the mechanisms underlying anesthesia are not
well elucidated and remain controversial, it appears likely
that the brain’s primary inhibitory neurotransmitter system
such as g- xxxd2177xxx  (gaba) is involved in anesthesia, since it has been shown that numerous classes of
anesthetic and hypnotic agents including volatile anesthetics, barbiturates, and benzodiazepines enhance endogenous gaba-mediated inhibition of neuronal activity in
the mammalian nervous system (see reviews franks and
lieb, 1998; little, 1996; pocock and richards, 1993;
tanelian et al., 1993). there is direct evidence indicating
the interaction of anesthetics with gabaa receptor demonstrated by in vitro electrophysiological studies. jones and

harrison (1993) showed that volatile anesthetics altered the
gating kinetics of gabaa receptor to prolong the duration
of gaba-mediated synaptic inhibition. volatile anesthetics
have been also found to reduce spontaneous firing of
neocortical neurons in culture mainly by increasing the
gabaa receptor-mediated mechanism (antkowiak and
helfrich-forster, 1998). however, in vivo elucidation of
the relationship between the central gabaergic system and
volatile or intravenous anesthetic-induced anesthesia have
not been fully carried out. in vivo behavioral studies
revealed that gabaa receptor agonists increase and the
antagonists decrease barbiturate-induced hypnosis (chweh
et al., 1987; sivam et al., 1982). there is also evidence
indicating the interaction of the volatile anesthetic halothane
and benzodiazepines in producing anesthesia in mice
(chambers et al., 1978; geller et al., 1989; moody and
skolnick, 1988). recently, irifune et al. (1999) reported that
propofol anesthesia in mice was potentiated by muscimol
and reversed by bicuculline. however, the mechanisms of

the action of volatile anesthetics have yet to be extensively
elucidated in vivo.
facilitation of gabaergic inhibitory neuronal systems
can be induced by several mechanisms different from the
potentiation of postsynaptic gabaa receptor function.
potential presynaptic mechanisms include: decreased
gaba metabolism, enhanced gaba release, and decreased gaba uptake, as suggested by in vitro studies
using brain slices and synaptosomes (see review griffiths
and norman, 1993). the purpose of the present study was to
elucidate in vivo the involvement of pre- and postsynaptic
gabaergic mechanisms in anesthesia using a behavioral
model in mice. to this end, we examined the effects of
gaba uptake inhibitors on anesthesia induced by the
volatile anesthetics halothane and isoflurane together with
the intravenous anesthetic barbiturate,  xxxd3348xxx . these
effects were compared with those of gaba receptor mimetics or antagonists.

2. methods
2.1. animals
the present study was approved by the committee of
research facilities for laboratory animal science, hiroshima university school of medicine. we used 4 –5-week-old
icr male mice (slc, japan), weighing 16– 24 g.
2.2. drugs
gaba uptake inhibitors, (±)-nipecotic acid (sigma,
usa), skf89976a hydrochloride (tocris, usa),  xxxd2248xxx 
hydrochloride (tocris), no-711 hydrochloride (sigma),
gabaa receptor agonist, muscimol (sigma),  xxxg828xxx  agonist, baclofen (ciba-geigy; novartis, japan), gabaa
receptor antagonists,  xxxd2947xxx  (katayama chemical,
japan), bicuculline (sigma) were dissolved in 0.9% saline.
the benzodiazepine receptor agonist, diazepam (wako,
japan) was dissolved in 0.1 ml ethanol and added to 9.9 ml
saline. each drug solution was freshly prepared on the day of
the experiment. all drugs described above were administered
intraperitoneally (ip) at a volume of 10 ml/kg. control
animals received equal volume of vehicles. the doses and
pretreatment times of these drugs were nipecotic acid: 200
and 400 mg/kg, 30 min; skf89976a: 1 and 2 mg/kg, 30 min;
 xxxd2248xxx : 10 and 20 mg/kg, 30 min; no-711: 1 and 2 mg/kg,
30 min; muscimol: 0.5 and 1 mg/kg, 15 min; baclofen: 10 and
20 mg/kg, 10 min; diazepam: 1 and 2 mg/kg, 10 min;
 xxxd2947xxx : 1 and 2 mg/kg, 5 min; and bicuculline: 1, 2, and
4 mg/kg, 10 min. a preliminary study confirmed that these
agents at the doses used caused neither loss of righting reflex
(lorr) nor convulsion by themselves.
experiments with volatile anesthetics were conducted in
a flow-through system (chambers et al., 1978; geller et al.,
1989; moody and skolnick, 1988). based on the prelim-

inary examination of concentration (1% to 3%), exposure
time (3 to 10 min), and flow rate (2 to 4 l/min) of volatile
anesthetics, 1.5% halothane (zeneca takeda chemical
industries, japan), and 2% isoflurane (abott, usa) were
administered from the calibrated fluotec 3 (for halothane)
and forwick (for isoflurane) vaporizer at a flow rate of
4 l/min oxygen for 5 min. the vaporizer was connected to
a plastic box with internal dimensions of 21  15  8 cm,
and inlet and outlet holes of 1.0 cm diameter on opposite
faces. anesthetic concentrations in the chamber were
monitored using an infrared analyzer. intravenous anesthetic  xxxd3348xxx  (45 mg/kg ip) (yoshitomi pharmaceutical,
japan) was administered at a volume of 10 ml/kg.
2.3. estimation of anesthesia
the anesthetic action was assessed using the righting
reflex. after administration of anesthetics, the plastic box
was inclined gradually and mice were placed on their backs
at 15-s intervals. animals were considered to have lost their
righting reflex when they did not right themselves for more
than 10 s. they were considered to have regained that
ability when all four paws touched the ground simultaneously upon landing (chambers et al., 1978; geller et al.,
1989; moody and skolnick, 1988).
after pretreatment with gabaergic agents or vehicles,
animals were individually placed in the plastic box and
exposed to 1.5% halothane or 2% isoflurane for 5 min.
the onset of the lorr was defined as the time between
the start of exposure to anesthetics and the loss. after
5 min exposure, mice were removed from the plastic box
and placed on their back in an open cage. the duration of
lorr was determined as the time between the removal
from the box and the recovery of the righting reflex
(chambers et al., 1978; geller et al., 1989; moody and
skolnick, 1988). for  xxxd3348xxx  anesthesia, the onset of
lorr was the time between the injection of  xxxd3348xxx 
and the lorr. the duration of lorr in  xxxd3348xxx 
anesthesia was the time between the onset of and the
emergence from lorr.
2.4. statistical analysis
the results were analyzed by a one-way factorial analysis
of variance (anova) with fisher’s plsd for post hoc test.
statistical significance was assumed where p values were
less than .05.

in table 1.
both skf89976a (2 mg/kg) and no-711 (2 mg/kg),
gaba uptake inhibitors known to be permeable to the
blood – brain barrier (bbb) (borden et al., 1994; nielsen

(up to 400 mg/kg) or  xxxd2248xxx  (up to 20 mg/kg), which
are less permeable to the bbb, significantly shortened the
onset of lorr induced by halothane and isoflurane.
similar effects of these agents were observed in thiamylalinduced anesthesia.
all the gaba mimetics, muscimol (0.5 and/or 1 mg/kg),
baclofen (10 and 20 mg/kg), and diazepam (1 and/or 2 mg/kg)
shortened the onset of lorr induced by halothane, isoflurane, and  xxxd3348xxx . on the other hand,  xxxd2947xxx  (2 mg/kg),
a gabaa receptor antagonist, prolonged the onset of lorr
induced by halothane, isoflurane, and  xxxd3348xxx . another
gabaa receptor antagonist, bicuculline at doses of 2 and
4 mg/kg shortened the onset of lorr induced by halothane, but failed to affect the onset of lorr induced by
isoflurane or  xxxd3348xxx .

table 2 shows the effects of gabaergic agents on
the duration of lorr induced by halothane, isoflurane,
and  xxxd3348xxx .
all the gaba uptake inhibitors at the doses tested failed
to change the duration of lorr induced by volatile anesthetics, except that no-711 and skf89976a at doses of
1 and/or 2 mg/kg prolonged the duration of lorr induced
by halothane and isoflurane, but these differences were not
significant. however, no-711 (2 mg/kg) and skf89976a
(2 mg/kg), but not nipecotic acid (up to 400 mg/kg) or
 xxxd2248xxx  (up to 20 mg/kg), significantly prolonged sleeping
time induced by  xxxd3348xxx .
all the gaba mimetics examined profoundly prolonged
the duration of lorr induced by halothane, isoflurane, and
 xxxd3348xxx  (muscimol at 1 mg/kg for halothane and isoflurane and 0.5 and 1 mg/kg for  xxxd3348xxx ; baclofen at 20 mg/kg
for halothane and isoflurane and 10 and 20 mg/kg for
 xxxd3348xxx ; diazepam at 1 and 2 mg/kg for halothane and

receptor antagonists,  xxxd2947xxx  and bicuculline, at the doses
tested had no effect on the duration of lorr induced by
these anesthetics, except that  xxxd2947xxx  (2 mg/kg) shortened
the  xxxd3348xxx -induced sleeping time, but this was not

4. discussion
numerous attempts have been made to elucidate the
involvement of the gabaergic system in the mechanisms
of anesthesia. in vitro studies have clearly demonstrated that
various types of anesthetic and hypnotic agents including
volatile anesthetics, barbiturates, and benzodiazepines
potentiate gabaergic synaptic transmission at least by
activation/potentiation of gabaa receptor (see reviews
franks and lieb, 1998; little, 1996; tanelian et al.,
1993). li and pearce (2000) showed that halothane slows
the dissociation of gaba from gabaa receptor, resulting
in the prolongation of the inhibitory postsynaptic current
(ipsc) decay at central synapses, which was suggested to be

a major factor in the production of anesthesia. however, the
precise mechanisms of the pre- and postsynaptic actions of
anesthetic agents on the gabaergic system underlying
anesthesia were not fully clarified, and there is little evidence from in vivo investigations on the interaction of
anesthetics with the gabaergic system. to address this
issue, the present study examined the relationship between
changes in gabaergic activities by pharmacological
manipulation in the central nervous system and anesthetic
effect of volatile and intravenous anesthetics in an in vivo
behavioral model in mice.
consistent with previous studies demonstrating the
effects of barbiturates and benzodiazepines on anesthesia
in vivo (chambers et al., 1978; chweh et al., 1987; geller et
al., 1989; moody and skolnick, 1988; sivam et al., 1982),
the present study demonstrated that the gabaa receptor
agonists, muscimol, as well as the benzodiazepine receptor
agonist, diazepam, shortened the onset of lorr and
prolonged the duration of lorr induced by volatile and
intravenous anesthetics, while gabaa receptor antagonists
reversed the anesthetics action in some cases. these results
suggested that gaba receptor agonists and antagonists

m. sugimura et al. / pharmacology, biochemistry and behavior 72 (2002) 111–116

conversely modified anesthetics-induced lorr. furthermore, gaba uptake inhibitors permeable to the bbb, but
not those less permeable to the bbb, accelerated the onset
of lorr induced by anesthetics. in addition, the selective
 xxxg828xxx  agonist, baclofen (bowery, 1993), shortened the onset of and prolonged the duration of lorr
induced by all anesthetics examined in the present study.
 xxxg828xxx  can be distinguished pharmacologically
from gabaa receptor (bowery, 1993) and a recent molecular biological approach successfully identified gabab
receptor cdna, which is a member of gene family of g
protein-coupled receptor with the 7 transmembrane structure
(marshall et al., 1999). activation of  xxxg828xxx  is
known to cause the inhibition of ca2 + channels and the
activation of k + channels, resulting in presynaptic inhibition (bowery, 1993). hirota and roth (1997) demonstrated
that  xxxd3197xxx  at clinical concentrations activates both
gabaa- and gabab-mediated inhibitions in area ca1
of the rat hippocampus. taken together, it is suggested that
anesthesia induced by volatile and intravenous anesthetics
might be correlated with the modification of pre- and/or
postsynaptic gabaergic activities.
however, the current results do not provide any clear
distinction between pre- and postsynaptic events necessary
for anesthesia induced by volatile and intravenous anesthetics. the effects of gaba uptake inhibitors on halothane-, isoflurane-, and  xxxd3348xxx -induced lorr suggest,
at least in part, the importance of presynaptic gabaergic
activity in the anesthetic state induced by these volatile and
intravenous anesthetic agents. if the effect on the gaba
uptake system is involved in the presynaptic modulation of
gabaergic activities produced by anesthetics, it should be
requisite to provide evidence that they do affect the gaba
uptake. however, the effects of general anesthetics on the
gaba uptake process are not thoroughly understood. a
previous study reported no effect of thiopental,  xxxd2599xxx , ketamine, halothane, or urethane on the uptake of
gaba into rat brain slices (minchin, 1981), while another
reported a concentration-dependent inhibition of gaba
uptake into rat striatal synaptosomes by propofol, etomidate, thiopental, and ketamine, but not by halothane or
 xxxd1993xxx  (mantz et al., 1995). we have strictly examined
the effects of the volatile anesthetics, halothane and isoflurane, and the intravenous anesthetic,  xxxd3348xxx , on
gaba uptake in cos cells transfected with mouse gaba
transporter ( xxxg1402xxx -1) cdna and in rat brain synaptosomes,
and found that both halothane and isoflurane, but not
 xxxd3348xxx , at clinically relevant concentrations inhibited
gaba uptake in both preparations (sugimura et al.,
2001). provided that this presynaptic mechanism is
involved in the production of anesthesia, further manipulation of the same pathways would not yield an appreciable
affect. such an idea appears to be in favor of accounting for
the present observation that the pretreatment with gaba
uptake inhibitors shortened the onset of lorr, but failed to
affect the duration of lorr induced by halothane or

isoflurane, while they shortened the onset of and prolonged
the duration of lorr induced by  xxxd3348xxx . although the
studies examining the effects of gabaergic agents on
anesthesia induced by volatile and intravenous anesthetics
in an in vivo behavioral model in mice used here do have
clear limitations in interpretation, taken together with our
previous observation of the effects of anesthetics on gaba
uptake in in vitro systems (sugimura et al., 2001), it is
suggested that possible sites in the presynaptic gaba
uptake system in addition to postsynaptic gaba receptors
might be involved in the anesthetic action.
the noncompetitive antagonist,  xxxd2947xxx , prolonged the
onset of lorr induced by the volatile anesthetics, halothane
and isoflurane, and the intravenous anesthetic,  xxxd3348xxx ,
whereas the competitive antagonist, bicuculline, only prolonged the onset of lorr induced by halothane. the latter
finding may, at least in part, reflect the different mechanisms
underlying anesthesia induced by volatile and intravenous
anesthetics. hirota et al. (1998) reported that the action of
volatile and intravenous anesthetics on evoked synaptic
responses are different, which may result from different
effects on gabaergic mechanisms that modulate synaptic
transmission, as suggested by the different sensitivities to
bicuculline. however, bicuculline slowed the onset of lorr
induced by halothane but not by isoflurane. the present
results were inconsistent with such an interpretation. it is not
known at present why the different antagonists have markedly different effects. further studies are needed to clarify the
effects of bicuculline and  xxxd2947xxx  on anesthesia induced
by volatile and intravenous anesthetics.
in conclusion, the present study examined the in vivo
effects of gaba receptor modulators and gaba uptake
inhibitors on volatile and intravenous anesthetic-induced
anesthesia in mice as a behavioral model. although the
present study has clear limitations in interpretation, it is
suggested that anesthesia induced by these anesthetics might
be correlated with the modification of the pre- and/or
postsynaptic gabaergic activities.
