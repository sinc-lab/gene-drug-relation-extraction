t h e increasing clinical use of the beta adrenergic
receptor blocking agents such as propranolol has
stimulated interest in the entire s p e c t r u m of
adrenergic drugs. in a series of three articles this
whole field will be examined and reviewed. t h e
first part will consider the receptor and its agonists. t h e second will cover the general aspects of
adrenergic b l o c k a d e . t h e third section will
consider the beta-blocking agents in some
detail.
t h e adrenergic receptor is the site of action of
norepinephrine, the n e u r o t r a n s m i t t e r of sympathetic adrenergic nerves, l o c a t e d on the effector
cell (muscle or gland), the adrenergic receptor is
also the site of action of epinephrine, the principal
h o r m o n e of the h u m a n adrenal medulla. in addition, the receptor is acted on by a m u l t i t u d e of
drugs related s t r u c t u r a l l y to the n a t u r a l catecholamines. n o t all receptors are associated with
innervated effectors. some a p p e a r to be " n a k e d . "

t h e function of the adrenergic receptor is to
detect and interact with the transmitter. this
interaction triggers s o m e characteristic response
of the effector cell. t h e basic i n t e r a c t i o n between
the agonist and the receptor is p r o b a b l y a conformational change in some p a r t of the cell
membrane. some evidence for this is: (1) the
receptor responds best to a favorite chemical
structure, epinephrine, and (2) it prefers lefthanded (levorotatory) molecules. it is p o s t u l a t e d

cyclase and cyclic-amp. however, for our
purposes the exact mechanism of this step is
unimportant.
the i m p o r t a n t cardiovascular responses controlled by adrenergic receptors are: (1) increased
sinus h e a r t rate (positive chronotropic action), (2)
increased force of m y o c a r d i a l c o n t r a c t i o n (positive inotropic action), (3~ increased rate of
conduction within the a-v system, (4) vasoconstriction of almost all blood vessels, and (5}
vasodilation of n u t r i e n t blood vessels.
dale 1 in 1906 described w h a t he called the
"receptive mechanism for adrenaline" he used
this concept at the time to explain the actions of
the ergot alkaloids. however, he a p p a r e n t l y never
again considered receptors. cannon and rosenblueth 2 evoked an adrenergic receptor in their
theory of the two sympathins, e and i. in their
view the receptor was a tissue c o m p o n e n t that
joined with epinephrine from the nerve end to
form sympathin. t h e idea of s y m p a t h i n e {excitatory) and s y m p a t h i n i linhibitory) has not
survived.
in 1948 we ~'4 ~ published the results of a
comparative study of five catecholamines. these
amines were those most closely related to
epinephrine and included  xxxd2401xxx , norepinephrine, cobefrine, epinephrine, and methylepinephrine. t h e i r activities were compared on a
variety of isolated tissues and i n t a c t animal
systems. it was found t h a t only two orders of
activity were found. on one set of responses
epinephrine was the most potent, with  xxxd2401xxx  the least potent. on the o t h e r set of
responses,  xxxd2401xxx  was the most p o t e n t and
norepinephrine the least potent.
t h e only way t h a t the results could be
explained was to assume t h a t there are at least
two different kinds of adrenergic receptor. one we
called alpha, the other beta. according to this
concept, the adrenergic cardiovascular responses

are: (1) vasoconstriction through alpha receptors,
and (2) cardiac stimulation and vasodilation
through beta receptors.
our dual receptor concept was more or less
ignored in the united states. however, it was well
accepted abroad and m a ny confirmatory papers
appeared. it was not until a specific blocking
agent for the beta receptor was found t ha t the
dual receptor concept became generally acceptable and clinically useful.
the classical sympathetic blocking agents such
as the ergot alkaloids and yohimbine were found
to act mainly on the alpha receptor. the
discovery by nickerson 6 of dibenamine, an absolutely specific alpha-blocking agent, initiated a
search for more and better alpha blockers.
table i lists some clinically useful agonists. it
demonstrates th a t epinephrine is the most potent
agonist when both receptors are considered. as is
well known, the administrator of this catecholamine evokes all adrenergic cardiovascular
responses. this leads to a confusing manifestation
of action. an intravenous infusion can produce
tachycardia, increased pulse pressure, increased
cardiac output, a decrease in total peripheral
resistance, a decrease in diastolic pressure, and
intense cutaneous and renal vasoconstriction.
the exact response depends on the control conditions.
it is not the purpose of this series to detail the
clinical uses of adrenergic drugs, since with the
possible exception of the beta receptor blocking
agents these are well known. rather, it is our
purpose to describe these drugs in terms of

(}62

modern adrenergic receptor theory. this should
make it easier to understand the clinical actions,
uses, interactions, and precautions.
norepinephrine, when administered as a pressor agent, gives the appearance of acting only on
alpha receptors. peripheral resistance and diastolic pressure are increased, the m e a n arterial
pressure increases causing a reflex bradycardia,
and the skin shows vasoconstriction. t he renal
blood flow decreases markedly. all of these are
alpha effects. norepinephrine, however, does act
on beta receptors since this catecholamine is the
adrenergic transmitter. it is only when it is
administered exogenously t hat the alpha effect
predominates.
phenylephrine is a specific alpha agonist. its
cardiovascular effects are obvious. generalized
vasoconstriction resulting in a pressor response
with reflex bradycardia results from any form of
parenteral administration. a comparison with
norepinephrine can be illustrated by the drug
concentration in the intravenous infusate. for
 xxxd2750xxx  this is 2 rag. of base in 500 ml. of
dextrose 5 per cent: for phenylephrine this is 10
mg. in 500 ml. phenylephrine can be administered
subcutaneously, intramuscularly, or intravenously. norepinephrine can be administered only
intravenously. if norepinephrine escapes into the
perivenous tissue, a "perm anent " alpha receptor
mediated vasoconstriction is the result. this leads
to tissue necrosis and sloughing. this accident
can be treated by local administration of an
alpha-blocking agent such as  xxxd2914xxx .
in ordinary clinical usage phenylephrine has no
direct adrenergic action on the heart. phenylephrine bradycardia is a reflex effect due to t he rise in
pressure. therefore, no rise in arterial pressure, no
bradycardia. under certain conditions phenylephrine can induce ventricular arrhythmias. for
example, in a hypotensive state there may be
excessive reflex sympathetic cardiac stimulation.
the reflex vagal stimulation evoked by phenylephrine as it raises the pressure can produce a
transient heart block. this allows the ventricle to
show a sympathetic-induced arrhythmia.
the actions and uses of  xxxd2601xxx  are
similar to those of phenylephrine. of historical
interest is a paper by levy and ahlquist ~in which
it was hinted that  xxxd2601xxx  could block beta
receptors, especially those of blood vessels. this
finding was made before beta-blocking agents
were discovered.

alpha and beta adrenergic drugs i.

 xxxd2401xxx  ( xxxd2398xxx } is the specific beta
receptor agonist. this catecholamine produces an
increase m heart rate, myocardial contraction,
and atrioventricular conduction velocity.  xxxd2401xxx  also produced vasodilation. this is greatest in skeletal muscle and least in the kidney.
 xxxd2401xxx  is a well-established drug in cardiology.8 however, as with any other drug, there are
still disagreements as to its actions and uses m
specific patients. for example, which is better in
cardiogenic shock, norepinephrine or  xxxd2401xxx ? both stimulate the myocardium. but norepinephrine increases the peripheral resistance while
 xxxd2401xxx  decreases resistance.
epinephrine is the second most potent beta
agonist. its use. however, is limited by its strong
vasoconstricting action through alpha receptors.
vasoconstrictors are commonly added to local
anesthetic solutions. in this regard epinephrine is
the most potent, followed by norepinephrine and
phenylephrine. care must be taken when
epinephrine is injected into areas having only
alpha receptors. for example, gangrene can be
produced in the toes. norepinephrine also acts on
beta receptors but this action is obscured by its
alpha action.
each adrenergic receptor and its associated
effector cell has a unique dose-response relationship. this means t h a t it is possible to have
agonists ~hat are selective in their action. terbutaline is a selective agonist acting primarily on
the beta receptors of smooth muscle. when used
to treat bronchial asthma, terbutaline has only a
slight action on cardiac beta receptors. this is in
contrast to  xxxd2401xxx  whose antiasthmatic
action may be complicated by excessive myocardial stimulation.
a third category of adrenergic agonists include
the indirect agents such as  xxxd2567xxx , the
false-transmitter producers like  xxxd2584xxx , the
partial agonists such as ethylnorepinephrine, and
the mixed-function substances exemplified by
dopamine.
 xxxd2567xxx  acts by displacing the norepinephrine stored in the granules in adrenerglc
nerve ends. this drug requires an intact nerve end
in order to show its pharmacodynamic effect.
chronic adrenergic denervation, either surgical or
chemical, interferes with its action. on administration, the cardiovascular effects are cardiac
stimulation and vasoconstriction.
 xxxd2584xxx  acts partly indirectly by displac-

american heart journal

ing norepinephrine from nerve ends. it also acts
directly on alpha receptors. and finally,  xxxd2584xxx  replaces norepinephrine in the nerve end,
enters the storage mechanism, and then functions
as a false-transmitter. when administered intravenously, it acts basically as a pressor agent.
however, on stopping long-term infusion, the
adrenergic nerves' natural function is impaired.
ethylnorepinephrine is a beta agonist used as
an antiasthmatic. however, its action is so
complex it is difficult to understand how it can be
used clinically. in experimental animals, at least,
repetitive administration shows it to be a betablocking agent and an alpha agonist. the following illustrates these effects. the first intravenous
dose of ethylnorepinephrine produces a depressor
response. as this dose is repeated, the depressor
response vanishes and is replaced by a pressor
response. these effects could occur in a patient
with severe asthma using frequent doses of ethylnorepinephrine.
dopamine is a complex agent. it increases
contractility, stroke volume, and cardiac output
by acting on beta receptors of the heart. in high
dosage dopamine produces vasoconstriction by
acting on alpha receptors. in low and moderate
doses it increases renal blood flow by acting on
specific dopaminergic receptors. however, at high
doses renal vasoconstriction will appear. from a
clinical standpoint the adverse effects of dopamine are identical to those of norepinephrine;
the adverse effects are due to alpha receptor
activation.

summary
the cardiovascular alpha adrenergic receptors
evoke vasoconstriction, the cardiovascular beta
receptors evoke vasodilation and cardiac stimulation: all blood vessels have both alpha and beta
receptors, in some areas, for example skin and
kidney, the alpha receptors predominate. in some
vascular beds, for example the nutrient vessels in
skeletal muscle, beta receptors predominate. in
other beds, such as coronary, visceral, and
connective tissue, both receptors are active.
the cardiovascular effects of adrenergic agonists depend on which receptor they act on. phenylephrine is specific for alpha receptors.  xxxd2401xxx  is specific for beta receptors. epinephrine
and norepinephrine act on both.
the real value of knowing the receptor specificity of each agonist is that side effects can more
