abstract

 xxxd2594xxx  (mmi) and  xxxd3036xxx  (ptu) are common antithyroid drugs for treating hyperthyroidism because the 2 drugs inhibit  xxxg2320xxx  (tpo)-catalyzed thyroid hormone formation. we studied whether
the 2 drugs actually inhibit cellular tpo activity in cultured porcine follicles. porcine follicles were cultured in
the presence of 1 mu/ml  xxxd3368xxx  (tsh) for 7 days. then follicles were exposed to mmi or ptu in the presence of 0.1 pm kl for 2 days. tpo activity was measured in the 100,000 x g-pellet of the thyroid sonicate by
the guaiacol oxidation method. exposure to mmi (1 pm and 10 pm) or ptu (10 pm and 100 pm) for 2 days
caused a significant increase in cellular tpo activity; 100 pm mmi inhibited cellular tpo activity. the presence of  xxxd1773xxx  (camp)-generating system ( xxxd1742xxx ) in tsh-free medium increased
mmi-mediated tpo activity. cyclohexamide inhibited mmi-mediated tpo activation, indicating that new protein synthesis is required for increased tpo activity. reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (rt-pcr)
showed an increase in tpo mrna by ptu or mmi. in conclusion, mmi and ptu at therapeutic concentrations can increase tpo mrna and cellular tpo activity, although the 2 drugs inhibit the tpo-h202-mediated
catalytic reaction.

in the present study
the 2 antithyroid drugs have any direct
effect on cellular tpo activity and tpo mrna levels.
there has been no study demonstrating changes in cellular tpo activity in response to ptu or mmi. leer et al.
(11) have shown that mmi increased tpo and thyroglobulin gene expression in cultured human thyroid
cells and frtl-5 cells; however, tpo activity in the thyroid cell has not been measured. isozaki et al. (12) showed
that mmi at high concentrations increased thyroglobulin
mrna and not tpo mrna in frtl-5 cells. thus, the
effect of mmi on tpo mrna levels is controversial. furthermore, it is difficult to measure tpo activity in cultured thyroid cells except in primary culture of dog thyroid cells (13) and porcine follicular cells (14). our
present study describes an increase in cellular tpo activity and tpo mrna by mmi and ptu in cultured
porcine thyroid follicles.

many clinicians. the antithyroid mechanisms of the 2

(7-9). these studies revealed reversible and irreversible

follicles in 2 wells of 6-well culture plates were pooled,
washed twice with phosphate buffered saline (pbs) solution, ph 7.0, and sonicated. then, they were centrifuged
at 100,000 x g for 60 minutes at 4°c; the pellet was reconstituted to 1 ml with pbs, sonicated, and used for measurement of tpo activity by the modified method of guaiacol oxidation (18). the reaction mixture contained pbs

buffer, a 100 to 200 pl sonicated 100,000 g pellet, 12
pmo\ guaiacol and 880 nmol h2o2 in a total volume of 1
ml. the reaction was started by adding h2o2, and the increases in absorbance were measured at optical density
(od) of 470 nm in a shimadzu spectrophotometer (kyoto,
japan). this crude tpo sample gave a linear increase in
tpo activity up to 300 pl of volume. the dna content

of the sonicate was measured by the  xxxd2976xxx  fluorescent method (19). tpo activity was expressed as guaiacol
unit per mg dna; 1 guaiacol unit was arbitrarily defined
as an increase in od of 1.0 at 1 minute. to examine
whether mmi or ptu affects other microsomal enzymes,
nadph- xxxg569xxx  reducíase activity (a marker of microsomal enzyme) was also measured in the sonicate of a
100,000 g-pellet by the rate of  xxxg569xxx  reduction at
550 nm (20). the result was expressed as nanomoles of
 xxxg569xxx  reduced per milligram dna in 1 min using
an extinction coefficient of 21.1 (cm-1, mm-1) (20).

program, and was analyzed with the gelbase gel-blot pro
program (uvp). band intensities were measured in arbitrary units. the ratios of the native (pf-6) and internal
standard (h' fragment) intensities were plotted against the
quantity of pf-6 rna to construct the standard curve; the
quantity of tpo (pf-6 fragment) mrna from experimental samples was measured using this standard curve.

statistical

analysis

the results of tpo activity shown here are one of multiple experiments; it was not feasible to use all experimental
data for statistical analysis because tpo activity varied
widely in each experiment depending on the quality of the
follicles. the dünnet multiple comparison test was used
when all experimental data were compared with the control. when 2 samples were compared, the unpaired student's t test was used.

when tpo activity is to be measured in cultured follicles, changes in tpo activity during culture should be examined first, because the initial decrease in tpo activity
followed by an increase in tpo activity is common in the
primary culture system (13). we found that the guaiacol

up to the sixth day of culture in the presof tsh; thereafter, enzyme activity rose. when tsh
was removed from the medium on the fourth day of culture, tpo activity decreased progressively. when  xxxd1742xxx 
(1 pg/ml) was added to the tsh-free medium on the
fourth day of culture, tpo activity was restored to almost
the same level as seen in the presence of tsh, indicating
that camp controls tpo activity.
figure 2 shows changes in cellular tpo activity in response to different concentrations of mmi and ptu. cellular tpo activities increased significantly after follicles were
exposed to 1 and 10 pm mmi for 48 hours; however, mmi
ence

at

pm inhibited cellular tpo activity. exposure to 10
jum ptu also increased cellular tpo activity.

ferent culture conditions. when mmi was added to the
small increase in tpo
activity. the mmi-mediated increase in cellular tpo activity was more prominent in the presence of  xxxd1742xxx . exposure to cyclohexamide negated mmi-mediated activation of tpo activity. the presence of 0.1 pm ki did not
alter mmi-or ptu-mediated tpo activity when compared
with that of no iodide in the medium (results not shown).

and 32.7 ± 0.6 nmole/mg dna, respectively (p:ns among
3 groups). thus, mmi and ptu did not affect nadphcytochrome c reductase activity.
tpo mrna levels

figure 4 depicts changes in tpo mrna levels by the
rt-pcr method in response to mmi and ptu. the density of the tpo band increased when follicles were exposed
to mmi or ptu in the presence of tsh. interestingly, 100
pm mmi, at which cellular tpo activity was inhibited,

antithyroid drug-induced

became

apparent 6 hr after exposure to mmi (results not shown);
also, the presence of camp system increased mmi-mediated tpo activation, since  xxxd1742xxx  increased mmi-mediated tpo activity in tsh-free medium (fig. 3). negation of mmi-mediated tpo activation by cyclohexamide
indicates an involvement of a new protein formation for
mmi-mediated tpo activation. mmi-or ptu-mediated increase in enzyme activity was specific to tpo, since
nadph- xxxg569xxx  reductase activity, another microsomal enzyme, was not activated by mmi or ptu. to investigate the mechanisms of tpo activation by the antithyroid drugs, tpo mrna levels were estimated by the
rt-pcr method. figure 4 clearly suggests that the antithyroid drugs increased tpo mrna levels. to confirm
this finding, the quantity of tpo mrna was measured by
the competitive rt-pcr method; indeed, mmi increased
the quantity of tpo mrna levels even in the absence of
tsh, although its increment was not as great as in the presence of tsh (table 1). these results suggest that activation of cellular tpo activity by therapeutic concentrations
of mmi or ptu is due to increased tpo mrna. however, 100 pm of mmi inhibited tpo activity, despite increased tpo gene expression (figures 2 and 4); thus, mmi
at a higher concentration appears to inhibit cellular tpo
activity directly or translation of the tpo mrna or both.

mrna. leer et al. (11) have shown an increase in tpo
and thyroglobulin mrna levels by mmi in cultured thyroid cells. however, the experiment by isozaki et al. (12)
did not show an increase in tpo mrna by mmi in frtl5 cells (12). our results are in agreement with the data of
leer et al. (11). what is the mechanism of activation of
tpo mrna by mmi or ptu? it is known that the tissuespecific expression of the tpo gene is regulated mainly at
the transcriptional level (22-24). thyroid transcription factor-1 (ttf-1) and a paired domain-containing protein
(pax-8) are well-known transcription factors for tpo and
thyroglobulin (24,25). interestingly, recognition sites of
transcription factors on tpo and thyroglobulin promoters
are aligned in a similar manner (24,25). thus, the data of
leer et al. (11) showing that mmi increases both tpo and
thyroglobulin mrna levels appear to fit coactivation of
both genes at the transcriptional level. arnone et al. (26)
and kambe et al. (27) have shown that the binding of thyroid transcription factors to thyroglobulin and tpo promoter or tpo enhancer is regulated by the oxydoreducsystem. mmi and ptu are sulfur-containing reducing
agents. it is conceivable that mmi or ptu might have facilitated the binding of thyroid transcription factors to the
tpo promoter, particularly in the presence of camp; this
event might have led to tpo gene activation and increased
cellular tpo activity.
our data clearly indicate that therapeutic concentrations
of mmi and ptu are not inhibitors of cellular tpo. in-
