abstract
 xxxd3350xxx  (tcc) is used clinically for its muscle relaxant, anti-inflammatory, and analgesic properties, and it has been shown to
interact with g- xxxd2177xxx  (gaba) type a receptors (gabaars) and strychnine-sensitive glycine receptors in the rat central nervous
system. in contrast to a proposed agonistic action at these two types of inhibitory receptors, pharmacological evidence has shown that, under
certain conditions, tcc manifests convulsant activity in animals and humans. we now show that the phasic and tonic gabaar-mediated currents recorded from purkinje cells and granule neurons, respectively, in parasagittal cerebellar slices from adult male rats were inhibited by tcc
in a concentration-dependent manner. the median inhibitory concentrations of tcc for these effects were w0.15 and w0.9 mm, respectively.
tcc did not potentiate gababr-mediated currents in hippocampal slices, suggesting that its muscle relaxant action is not mediated by
gababrs. intraperitoneal injection of tcc in rats either alone or in combination with negative modulators of gabaergic transmission
revealed convulsant and proconvulsant actions of this drug. our data, consistent with clinical observations of the epileptogenic effect of this
compound, suggest that tcc is a potent competitive antagonist of gabaar function.

1. introduction
 xxxd3350xxx  (tcc) (fig. 1a) is a semisynthetic sulfur
derivative of colchicoside, a naturally occurring glucoside present in the plant gloriosa superba. tcc has been used clinically
for more than 35 years as a muscle-relaxant, anti-inflammatory,
and analgesic drug (janbroers, 1987), but its molecular targets

and mechanisms of action are still under investigation. this
compound has been shown to inhibit the binding of
[3h]gaba (g- xxxd2177xxx ) or [3h]strychnine to rat cerebrocortical or spinal cord membranes, respectively, in vitro
as well as to corresponding autoradiographic sections in vivo
(balduini et al., 1999, 2001; cimino et al., 1996). [3h]tcc
was also displaced in a concentration-dependent manner by
gaba or by several agonists or antagonists of the type a
receptor for gaba (gabaar). moreover, tcc was shown
to interact preferentially with a subpopulation of gabaars
with low-affinity binding sites for gaba (balduini et al., 2001).
although its precise mechanisms of action remain unknown, tcc has been thought to act as a gabaar agonist

fig. 1. reversible inhibition by tcc of gabaar-mediated eipscs in cerebellar purkinje neurons. (a) molecular structure of  xxxd3350xxx  (tcc). (b) simplified representation of the cerebellar circuits relevant to the present study. mossy fibers, which originate in the spinal cord and brain stem, provide excitatory
inputs to granule and golgi cells. granule cells also receive inhibitory input from golgi cells and provide excitatory inputs to purkinje cells and molecular-layer
interneurons via parallel fibers. molecular-layer interneurons provide inhibitory input to purkinje cells. (c) averaged traces of three to five gabaar-mediated
currents recorded from a single cerebellar purkinje neuron. the eipscs were elicited by stimulation of molecular-layer interneurons near the recorded purkinje cell
in the presence of kynurenic acid (3 mm). currents were recorded under control conditions (a), in the presence of 0.1 mm tcc (b), after washout of tcc for 5 to
10 min (c, d), and in the presence of 20 mm bicuculline (e). scale bars: current amplitude, 200 pa; time, 100 ms. (d) time course of the effects of tcc and

that induces depression of the central nervous system and, in
turn, myorelaxation (biziere et al., 1981). however, under specific experimental or clinical conditions, tcc has been shown
to induce epileptic seizures (de riu et al., 2001; sechi et al.,
2003), challenging the notion that this drug acts as an agonist
at gabaars and raising the possibility that it may directly or
indirectly inhibit gabaergic transmission. moreover, tcc
possesses a molecular structure similar to that of colchicine,
a plant alkaloid that  xxxd1740xxx  and induces the depolymerization of microtubules (osborn and weber, 1976), disrupts axonal transport (karlsson and sjostrand, 1969), and
inhibits mitosis (wilson and friedkin, 1966). colchicine induces epileptic seizures in rodents (dasheiff and ramirez,
1985), and its intracranial administration triggers generalized
convulsions and death (wisniewski and terry, 1967). in addition to its well-characterized effects on microtubules, colchicine acts directly as a competitive antagonist of gabaar
function (weiner et al., 1998), possibly explaining, at least
in part, its epileptogenic action.
in view of these contrasting observations with tcc, we
have now investigated the effects of this drug on the function

of native gabaars in cerebellar slices with the patch-clamp
technique. purkinje neurons and cerebellar granule cells
of adult rats manifest a relatively uniform expression of
gabaar isoforms. in particular, purkinje neurons express
mostly gabaars that contain the a1, b2 or b3, and g2 subunits; these receptors exhibit a relatively low affinity for
gaba and are localized in the synaptic cleft (pirker et al.,
2000; wisden et al., 1996). in contrast, granule cells, in their
extrasynaptic regions, express gabaars that mostly comprise the a6, b2 or b3, and d subunits, exhibit a higher affinity
for gaba, and mediate the tonic component of inhibitory
transmission. in addition to these extrasynaptic receptors,
granule cells express synaptic gabaars that contain a1 or
a6, b2 or b3, and g2 subunits; these low-affinity receptors
bind gaba that is released from golgi cells and mediate
fast-rising spontaneous inhibitory postsynaptic currents
(sipscs) (brickley et al., 1996, 2001; hamann et al., 2002;
rossi and hamann, 1998; rossi et al., 2003; tia et al.,
1996; wall and usowicz, 1997). we now show that tcc is
a potent competitive antagonist of gabaar function. this
compound shows a greater potency at the synaptic gabaars

m. carta et al. / neuropharmacology 51 (2006) 805e815

of purkinje cells than at the extrasynaptic gabaars of granule cells. consistent with our electrophysiological observations,
in vivo experiments revealed that tcc acts as a convulsant and
proconvulsant drug. our results are thus in accord with the previous demonstration of focal and secondarily generalized convulsive epileptic activity of tcc in rats and humans (de riu et al.,
2001; sechi et al., 2003).
2. methods
2.1. animals
male spragueedawley cd rats were obtained from charles river (como,
italy). after arrival at the animal facility, rats were allowed to acclimatize to
the new housing conditions for at least 1 week. they were housed six per
cage under an artificial 12-h-light, 12-h-dark cycle (lights on from 08:00 to
20:00 h) and at a constant temperature of 22   2  c and relative humidity
of 65%. they had free access to water and standard laboratory food at all
times. animal care and handling throughout the experimental procedures
were in accordance with the european communities council directive of 24
november 1986 (86/609/eec). the experimental protocols were also approved by the animal ethics committee of the university of cagliari.

2.2. preparation of brain slices and electrophysiological
recording
rats (28 to 40 days old) were anesthetized in a chamber saturated with chloroform and then decapitated. the brain was removed rapidly and placed in an
ice-cold solution containing 220 mm sucrose, 2 mm kcl, 1.3 mm nah2po4,
12 mm  xxxd2534xxx , 0.2 mm cacl2, 10 mm glucose, and 2.6 mm nahco3 (ph
7.3, equilibrated with 95% o2 and 5% co2). coronal hippocampal slices (thickness, 300 mm) and parasagittal cerebellar slices (thickness, 200 to 250 mm) were
prepared with a vibratome 1000 plus instrument (vibratome, st. louis, mo)
and then incubated first for 40 min at 34  c and then for 30 min at room temperature in artificial cerebrospinal fluid (acsf) containing 126 mm nacl,
3 mm kcl, 1.25 mm nah2po4, 1 mm  xxxd2534xxx , 2 mm cacl2, 10 mm glucose,
and 26 mm nahco3 (ph 7.3, equilibrated with 95% o2 and 5% co2).
slices were transferred to a chamber perfused with acsf at a rate of w2 ml/
min and at room temperature. whole-cell patch-clamp electrophysiological recordings were performed with an axopatch 200-b amplifier (axon instruments,
union city, ca) and an infrared-differential interference contrast microscope.
patch microelectrodes (borosilicate capillaries with a filament and an outer diameter of 1.5 mm; sutter instruments, novato, ca) were prepared with a twostep vertical puller (sutter instruments) and had a resistance of 4 to 6 mu.
evoked inhibitory postsynaptic currents (eipscs) as well as tonic gabaergic
currents were recorded at a holding potential of 65 mv with an internal solution containing 140 mm cscl, 2 mm mgcl2, 1 mm cacl2, 10 mm egta,
10 mm hepes-csoh (ph 7.3), 2 mm atp (disodium salt), and 5 mm
qx-314 (lidocaine n-ethyl bromide). gababr-mediated currents were recorded at a holding potential of 50 mv with an internal solution containing
4 mm kcl, 0.1 mm egta, 10 mm hepes-koh (ph 7.3), 140 mm potassium
gluconate, and 2 mm atp (magnesium salt). all gabaergic currents were recorded in the presence of kynurenic acid (3 mm) in the external solution. access
resistance varied between 20 and 40 mu; if it changed by >20% during an experiment, the recording was discarded. currents through the patch-clamp amplifier were filtered at 2 khz and digitized at 5.5 khz with commercial software
(pclamp 8.2, axon instruments). in purkinje cells, eipscs were elicited with
a concentric bipolar stimulating electrode placed 100 to 200 mm from the
patched neuron. pairs of stimuli were delivered at 300-ms intervals every 20 s
(frequency of 0.05 hz). for analysis of tonic gabaergic currents, we used parameters described previously (carta et al., 2004). in brief, we selected epochs
of 3 s every 30 s of recording and visually excluded sipscs from the analysis.
for the analysis of sipscs, we visually selected all events, which are readily distinguishable from the background noise on the basis of their characteristic fast
rise times and slower decay times. evoked gababr-mediated currents were

807

elicited by placing the stimulating electrode 100 to 200 mm from the patched
ca1 hippocampal pyramidal neuron; a single stimulus was delivered every
30 s. unless indicated otherwise, each slice was exposed only once to a single
tcc concentration. the effect of tcc was quantified with respect to the average of control responses obtained before drug application.

2.3. primary culture of hippocampal neurons and
electrophysiological recording
primary cultures of hippocampal neurons were prepared from rats on postnatal days 1 to 3 as described previously (costa et al., 2000), with minor modifications. pups were killed by decapitation, and the hippocampus was
removed and transferred to a culture dish containing neurobasal a medium
(invitrogen, san diego, ca) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (sigma, st. louis, mo), 25 mm glutamate, 0.5 mm glutamine,
penicillin (100 u/ml), streptomycin (0.1 mg/ml), and  xxxd164xxx 
(0.25 mg/ml). the tissue was chopped with scissors, and the resulting fragments were transferred to a sterile tube and gently dissociated by repeated passage through a pasteur pipette with an opening of 0.5 mm. the dissociated cells
were plated in 24 well dishes (6  105 cells per well) containing 12-mm-diameter round glass coverslips coated with poly-l-lysine. cells were cultured in
a humidified incubator containing 5% co2 at 37  c. twenty-four hours after
plating, fetal bovine serum was replaced with b-27 supplement (invitrogen),
and glutamate was removed from the medium after 3 days of culture.
immediately before recording, coverslips were transferred to a perfusion
chamber (warner instruments, hampden, ct), and neurons were visualized
with a nikon upright microscope equipped with nomarski optics (40). large
neurons with a pyramidal shape and well-defined dendritic processes were selected for electrophysiological recording. the membrane potential was
clamped at 60 mv with an axopatch 200-b amplifier. preparation of the recording pipettes and the internal solution were as described for slice recording.
the external solution contained 130 mm nacl, 5 mm kcl, 2 mm cacl2,
1 mm mgcl2, 10 mm hepes-naoh (ph 7.3), and 11 mm glucose. drugs
were applied with a fast-exchange flow-tube perfusion system driven by a motor (warner instruments). gaba (0.5, 1, 10, 30, 100 mm) was applied at intervals of 30 s. all experiments were performed at room temperature (23 to
25  c). data were analyzed by pclampfit 8.01 software (axon instruments).
modulation of gaba-evoked cl currents by tcc was expressed as percentage change, [(i0 /i )  1]  100%, where i is the average of control responses
obtained before drug application, and i0 is the average of the gaba-induced
responses obtained from the same cell in the presence of drug.

2.4. evaluation of proconvulsant and convulsant activity
rats with body masses of 150 to 180 g were divided into groups of three to
nine for each pharmacological treatment. in one set of experiments, animals
were injected intraperitoneally (i.p.) with various doses of tcc from 10 to
30 mg per kilogram of body mass. in a second set of experiments, tcc (10
or 15 mg/kg, i.p.) was administered 30 min before the injection of pentylenetetrazol (ptz) at doses of 35, 45, or 55 mg/kg (i.p.).
in a third set of experiments, tcc (15 mg/kg, i.p.) was administered
30 min prior to the injection of the proconvulsant b-carboline fg 7142 (nmethyl-b-carboline-3-carboxamide) at 25 mg/kg (i.p.). all treated animals
were monitored for at least 60 min after drug administration for determination
of the seizure onset time (time between drug administration and the appearance of convulsions), the number of animals that manifested convulsions,
and the number of deaths. the pattern of seizure activity, which usually consisted of muscular contractions (twitches), wild running, and tonic and clonic
convulsions, was also monitored.

2.5. drugs
a stock solution of 10 mm tcc (kindly provided by inverni della beffa,
limito, milano, italy) was prepared in distilled water. stock solutions of bicuculline methiodide (sigma) and sch 50911 (tocris, bristol, uk) were prepared in  xxxd1896xxx  (maximal final concentration of 0.03%) and

808

m. carta et al. / neuropharmacology 51 (2006) 805e815

distilled water, respectively. kynurenic acid (sigma) was dissolved directly in
acsf at 3 mm. fg 7142 (kindly provided by schering a.g., berlin, germany) was dissolved in saline with one drop of tween 80 per 3 ml of solution.
ptz (sigma) was dissolved in physiological saline.

we first examined the effects of tcc on the function of
gabaars in purkinje and granule neurons present in thin cerebellar slices. we recorded eipscs in purkinje cells, in which
most synaptic gabaars comprise a1, b2 or b3, and g2 subunits (pirker et al., 2000; wisden et al., 1996). the eipscs
were elicited with a bipolar concentric stimulating electrode
placed in the molecular layer near the target neuron
(fig. 1b). kynurenic acid (3 mm) was added to the external
solution in order to block the various types of ionotropic glutamate receptors, thereby isolating gabaar-mediated currents. the eipscs were characterized by a fast rise time
(7.31  2.1 ms, n ¼ 29) and by a slower decay time
(69.8  4.8 ms, n ¼ 29), with an amplitude in the range of
300 to 1000 pa and with an average of 370.3  35.5 pa
(n ¼ 29). bath application of tcc (0.1 mm) induced a reversible inhibition of the gabaergic synaptic currents
(fig. 1c, d). the gabaar antagonist bicuculline (20 mm)
completely blocked all eipscs, confirming that they were
mediated by gabaars (fig. 1c, d). the inhibitory effect
of tcc was fully reversible at concentrations of 1 mm, but
was only partially reversible, even after several minutes of
washout, at concentrations of >1 mm (data not shown).
tcc (0.001 to 100 mm) reduced the amplitude of eipscs in
a concentration-dependent manner (fig. 2), with this effect being significant at 0.1 mm (50  9%) and maximal  xxxd1891xxx  mm
(96  2%). non-linear regression analysis yielded an apparent median inhibitory concentration (ic50) of 145 nm [95%
confidence interval (ci), 51 to 408 nm], with a hill slope of
0.44 (95% ci, 0.233 to 0.653).
we also examined whether tcc affected the kinetic parameters of eipscs. whereas tcc at concentrations of 0.001, 0.1,
or 1 mm had no significant effect on the rise time of eipscs, it
slightly but significantly reduced the decay time at 1 mm but
not at 0.1 or 0.001 mm (fig. 3a, b). we were not able to
analyze the effects of tcc at concentrations of >1 mm
because of the complete inhibition of gabaar-mediated currents apparent at such concentrations.

dose-ratios obtained from the displacements in the gaba concentration-response curves in the presence of increasing concentrations of tcc.

we next evaluated whether the inhibitory effect of tcc on
eipscs might be exerted at the presynaptic level through inhibition of gaba release. for these experiments, we applied
a paired-pulse protocol to study the function of presynaptic
terminals. when synaptic responses are elicited by two stimuli
delivered with a brief interpulse interval and at the same intensity, the amplitude of the second response depends on the
probability of neurotransmitter release. we placed the stimulating electrode near (within 50 to 100 mm of) the recorded
purkinje cell in order to stimulate the axons of the surrounding
interneurons. under these conditions, the paired-pulse ratio

tcc at concentrations of 0.001 to 100 mm had no significant
effect on the paired-pulse ratio (fig. 3c, d), suggesting that
tcc does not act at the presynaptic level and that its inhibition
of eipscs is mediated postsynaptically.
3.2. effect of tcc on gabaergic currents in cerebellar
granule cells
the possible effect of tcc on tonic inhibitory gabaergic
currents in cerebellar granule cells was next investigated.
these neurons express gabaars composed of a6, b2 or
b3, and d subunits in their extrasynaptic regions (brickley
et al., 1996, 2001; hamann et al., 2002; rossi and hamann,
1998; rossi et al., 2003; wall and usowicz, 1997). these
receptors possess a high affinity for gaba that is released
from golgi cells and spills over from the synaptic cleft, and
they mediate a non-desensitizing type of inhibitory current.
in addition, the gaba released from golgi cell axons activates synaptic gabaars that are composed mostly of a1 or

a6, b2 or b3, and g2 subunits and which generate sipscs
(brickley et al., 1996, 2001; hamann et al., 2002; rossi and
hamann, 1998; rossi et al., 2003; tia et al., 1996; wall and
usowicz, 1997).
consistent with previous observations (brickley et al.,
1996, 2001; carta et al., 2004; wall and usowicz, 1997), we
found that granule cells exhibited a tonic gabaergic current
that was abolished by a saturating concentration of bicuculline
(20 mm). in the presence of kynurenic acid (3 mm), the average size of the outward current induced by the application of
bicuculline (20 mm) was 28.95  6.1 pa (n ¼ 11), whereas
the percentage reduction in the noise variance was
62.97  5.29 (n ¼ 11) (fig. 4a, b). the application of tcc
(0.1 mm) had no significant effect on either the holding current
or the current noise variance (fig. 4c). after a washout period
of 10 min, bath application of tcc (10 mm) markedly reduced both the holding current and the noise variance. this effect of tcc was not completely reversible. finally, application
of bicuculline (20 mm) blocked all residual current. the effects of tcc on both the holding current (fig. 4d) and the

fig. 4. inhibition by tcc of tonic gabaergic currents in cerebellar granule neurons. (a) representative traces of tonic gabaergic currents recorded from a cerebellar granule neuron under control conditions and during the application of bicuculline (20 mm). scale bars: current amplitude, 20 pa; time, 10 ms. (b) summary
of the effects of bicuculline (20 mm) on the holding current (current shift) and current noise variance. data are means  sem (n ¼ 11). (c) representative traces of
the effect of tcc on tonic gabaergic currents. tcc was applied at concentrations of 0.1 and 10 mm with a washout (w/o) period of about 10 min between the
two applications. bicuculline (20 mm) was applied after subsequent washout of tcc at the higher concentration. scale bars: current amplitude, 20 pa; time, 10 ms.
(d, e) summary of the effects of tcc at 0.1 mm (n ¼ 5), 1 mm (n ¼ 7), 10 mm (n ¼ 5), and 100 mm (n ¼ 6) on the tonic holding current and noise variance,
respectively. data are means  sem. *p < 0.05, **p < 0.005, versus the hypothetical mean of zero (one-sample t test). (f, g, h) summary of the effects of
tcc at 0.1 mm (n ¼ 4), and 1 mm (n ¼ 6) on the amplitude, frequency and decay time of the sipscs, respectively. data are absolute values and are expressed
as means  sem. *p < 0.05, one-sample t test vs control value.

noise variance (fig. 4e) were concentration dependent. nonlinear regression analysis revealed that the ic50 for the effect
of tcc on the holding current was 0.89 mm (95% ci,
10.9 nm to 5.89 mm), with a hill slope of 1.42 (95% ci,
13.1 to 15.94), whereas that for the effect on noise variance
was 0.99 mm (95% ci, 0.39 to 2.5 mm), with a hill slope of
1.32 (95% ci of 1.2 to 3.8). all tonic gabaergic currents
were blocked by bicuculline (20 mm), confirming that they
were mediated by gabaars.
embedded in the tonic current, recordings from most (17 out
of 23) granule cells were detectable sipscs with an average
frequency of 0.42  0.11 hz, amplitude of 42.9  6.9 pa,
and a decay time of 6.24  0.71 ms. application of tcc at
0.1 mm (n ¼ 4), 1 mm (n ¼ 6), 10 mm (n ¼ 5), and 100 mm
(n ¼ 2) induced a concentration-dependent reduction in the
amplitude of sipscs. tcc, at 0.1 mm and 1 mm, changed the

amplitude of sipscs to 44.4  16.2 and 17.2  5.8 pa, respectively (fig. 4f). the inhibitory effect of tcc was significant
( p < 0.05) at 1 mm and the blockade of sipscs was complete
at the concentration of 10 mm. the apparent frequency of
sipscs was also reduced by tcc at concentrations of
1 mm, but this effect could be most likely attributable to a decrease in sipsc amplitude (fig. 4g), and not to a decrease in
frequency per se. finally, tcc at all the concentrations tested
failed to affect the decay time values of the sipscs (fig. 4h).
3.3. effect of tcc on gabaergic currents in cultured
hippocampal neurons
to determine whether the inhibition of gabaar function
by tcc was competitive or allosteric in nature, we performed
electrophysiological recordings from cultured hippocampal

m. carta et al. / neuropharmacology 51 (2006) 805e815

neurons. we tested the effect of three different concentrations
of tcc (0.1, 0.5 and 1 mm) on the cl currents evoked by
increasing concentrations of gaba (0.3 to 100 mm). the inhibitory effect of tcc on these currents decreased as the
gaba concentration increased (fig. 5). tcc (0.1, 0.5 and
1 mm) significantly shifted the gaba concentration-response
curves increasing the gaba ec50 from 6.1  1.1 mm to
7.9  1.8 mm, 18.66  1.18 mm, and 40.35  1.12 mm
respectively. the hill coefficient, from a control value of
0.99  0.2647 was not significantly changed in the presence
of tcc (0.1 mm, 0.9007  0.2973; 0.5 mm, 0.9118 
0.3556; 1 mm, 1.003  0.2558). the schild plot of log(dose
ratio e 1) against log tcc concentration resulted in a fitted
line with a slope value of 1.21  0.23 (fig. 5b).
3.4. effect of tcc on gababr-mediated currents in
hippocampal ca1 pyramidal neurons
given that baclofen, a selective gababr agonist, is used
clinically as a muscle relaxant (bowery et al., 2002; enna,
1997), we examined whether the observed myorelaxant effect
of tcc might be mediated by interaction with gababrs.
the gababr is a metabotropic receptor that, on stimulation
with gaba, activates a kþ channel in the postsynaptic neuron
and thereby induces hyperpolarization (newberry and nicoll,
1984). we recorded evoked gababr-dependent kþ currents
from visualized ca1 pyramidal neurons by electrically stimulating interneurons in the stratum radiatum (fig. 6a). we studied hippocampal ca1 pyramidal cells because of the lack of
a prominent gababr-mediated current in purkinje neurons.
for these experiments, we used a potassium gluconate-based
solution in the recording electrode and clamped the cells at
50 mv in the presence of kynurenic acid (3 mm) and bicuculline (20 mm). most gababr-mediated currents had an amplitude of 22.8  1.5 pa (n ¼ 21) and were characterized by slow
rise and decay times with an area of 5719  577 pams (n ¼ 21)

811

(fig. 6b), consistent with the kinetics of metabotropic receptormediated signal transduction (solis and nicoll, 1992). tcc 0.1,
1, and 10 mm changed the area of the gababr-mediated current to 5808  450, 4753  750, and 4104  823 pams, respectively. statistical analysis failed to reveal any significant
difference among groups. all the currents were blocked by
the gababr-selective antagonist sch 50911 at 20 mm. similar results were obtained by measuring the peak amplitude of
gababr-mediated currents (data not shown).
3.5. proconvulsant and convulsant actions of tcc in
healthy rats
previous in vivo studies showed that, under certain conditions, tcc induced focal and secondarily generalized convulsive epileptic seizures in both animal models and humans (de
riu et al., 2001; sechi et al., 2003). our in vitro data showing
that tcc is a competitive inhibitor of gabaar function suggested that this drug might have a convulsant or proconvulsant
profile. to evaluate this hypothesis, we tested the effects of
various doses of tcc administered to rats either alone or together with the b-carboline fg 7142 (a proconvulsant drug)
or ptz (a convulsant drug).
the i.p. administration of tcc (10 to 30 mg/kg) revealed
that the drug induced tonic-clonic seizures at doses of
20 mg/kg (table 1). at 20 mg/kg, tcc induced convulsions
in two out of five (40%) animals with a delay of 29  2 min.
in general, the seizures were characterized by a clonic component, affecting both the anterior and posterior limbs, and by
a more marked tonic component, with extension and rigidity
of limbs. the latency of seizures decreased as the dose of
tcc increased. at a dose of 30 mg/kg, tcc induced seizures
and death in all animals tested.
ptz, a non-competitive antagonist of the gabaar that
acts at the  xxxd2947xxx  site in the associated cl channel, exerts
convulsant activity in rats when injected i.p. at doses of

>60 mg/kg (macdonald and olsen, 1994; sieghart, 1995).
however, injection of non-convulsant doses of ptz (35 or
45 mg/kg) subsequent to injection with tcc at 15 mg/kg induced seizure activity in 80% of treated rats (table 1).
finally, we tested the effect of tcc in association with the
proconvulsant b-carboline derivate fg 7142 (little et al.,
1984; macdonald and olsen, 1994; sieghart, 1995). as expected, i.p. administration of fg 7142 alone at a dose of
25 mg/kg failed to induce seizures. however, injection of
this dose of fg 7142 subsequent to administration of tcc
at 15 mg/kg resulted in the development of tonic-clonic seizures and death in w70% of treated rats (table 1).
4. discussion
previous studies have suggested that tcc acts as an agonist
at gabaars in the central nervous system, and that this
action might contribute to the muscle relaxant, analgesic,
and local anesthetic properties of this drug (artusi et al.,
2003; biziere et al., 1981; janbroers, 1987; marcel et al.,
1990; perucca et al., 1995; schousboe, 1999). whereas the
results of our study support the notion that tcc interacts

with gabaars (balduini et al., 1999, 2001; biziere et al.,
1981; cimino et al., 1996), they provide direct evidence that
tcc inhibits the function of these receptors. our in vitro
and in vivo data, together with previous animal and clinical
studies (de riu et al., 2001; sechi et al., 2003), thus demonstrate that tcc acts as an effective inhibitor of gabaar
function and as a convulsant. we found evidence that allows
to suggest that tcc is a competitive antagonist at gabaars
and that the potency of its inhibitory effect may depend on the
subunit composition of these receptors. moreover, we showed
that gababrs appear to be largely unaffected by tcc, excluding the possibility that they mediate the myorelaxant
effect of this drug. finally, our results demonstrate that, in
addition to acting as a convulsant, even in rats with an intact
bloodebrain barrier, tcc has a proconvulsant profile at lower
doses.
4.1. tcc inhibits the function of synaptic gabaars
with a higher potency than it does that of
extrasynaptic gabaars
our electrophysiological data show that tcc reversibly inhibits the function of gabaars in cerebellar purkinje and
granule cells as well as in cultured hippocampal neurons.
the inhibitory potency of tcc was greater for evoked phasic
synaptic currents recorded from purkinje cells than for the
tonic currents recorded from granule cells. these two types
of gabaergic inhibitory currents are mediated by receptors
with different subcellular localizations, affinities for gaba,
and subunits. the synaptic currents in purkinje cells are mediated predominantly by gabaars that are composed of a1, b2
or b3, and g2 subunits and which possess a relatively low affinity for gaba (pirker et al., 2000; wisden et al., 1996). in
contrast, tonic currents in cerebellar granule cells are mediated
by gabaars that contain a6, b2 or b3, and d subunits and
which have a high affinity for gaba (brickley et al., 1996,
2001; hamann et al., 2002; rossi and hamann, 1998; rossi
et al., 2003; wall and usowicz, 1997). our finding that tcc
inhibits the function of synaptic receptors with a greater potency than it does on extrasynaptic receptors may suggest
that the former receptor subpopulation, which has a lower affinity for gaba, could represent a more sensitive target for
the inhibitory action of tcc. synaptic gabaars containing
a1, b2 or b3, and g2 subunits exhibit a median effective concentration for activation by gaba that is about 50 times the
corresponding value for extrasynaptic gabaars containing
a6, b2 or b3, and d (10 versus 0.2 mm) (saxena and macdonald, 1996). tcc also reduced the amplitude of sipscs recorded from granule cells in a concentration-dependent
manner and slightly reduced the decay time constant of
eipscs in purkinje cells.
our functional results are consistent with previous binding
data showing that tcc displaced the specific binding of
[3h]gaba in rat cortical synaptic membranes (balduini
et al., 1999). the authors of this previous study hypothesized
that tcc interacts differentially with gabaa receptors that
possess different affinities for gaba. the same researchers

813

subsequently found that tcc preferentially inhibited the specific binding of [3h]muscimol in sections of rat brain from regions that express low-affinity gabaars, such as those from
the cerebral cortex (balduini et al., 2001). tcc was not able to
displace completely the binding of [3h]muscimol in brain regions enriched in high-affinity gabaars, such as the granule
cell layer of the cerebellum. it is likely that these high-affinity
gabaars in the granule cell layer of the cerebellum are those
that contain a6, b2 or b3, and d subunits.
the preferential inhibition of synaptic versus extrasynaptic
gabaars is also a feature of gabazine (sr 95531), a competitive gabaar antagonist (stell and mody, 2002; ueno et al.,
1997). on the basis of its ability to inhibit the function of
synaptic receptors at lower concentrations than those required
to block the function of extrasynaptic receptors, gabazine is
commonly used in experimental settings to isolate pharmacologically the tonic component of gabaergic inhibition.
the profile of tcc as a competitive antagonist at gabaars
was confirmed by our observation that the efficacy of tcc
with regard to inhibition of gaba-evoked cl currents in
pyramidal neurons in culture decreased as the concentration
of gaba increased. similarly, the tcc analog colchicine
was previously shown to inhibit currents mediated by human
recombinant gabaars containing a1, b2, and g2l subunits
expressed in murine l(tk-) cells and to shift the concentration-response curve for gaba to the right (weiner et al., 1998).
4.2. tcc does not modulate gababr-dependent
currents in ca1 pyramidal neurons
ca1 pyramidal neurons express functional postsynaptic
gababrs that trigger a kþ current on activation by gaba
released from interneurons. our electrophysiological and
functional data support previous biochemical results suggesting that the myorelaxant effect of tcc is not dependent on
an interaction with gababrs. the gababr agonist baclofen
was thus previously found to be ineffective in displacing the
specific binding of [3h]tcc in synaptic cortical membranes
(balduini et al., 1999).
4.3. tcc is a potent proconvulsant and convulsant drug
our in vivo data show that tcc exerts a convulsant action
when administered i.p. in male rats at doses of 20 mg/kg
(but not at lower doses). these results are in agreement with
previous observations showing that tcc was ineffective in inducing seizures in healthy rats at doses up to 12 mg/kg (sechi
et al., 2003). tcc, being a highly hydrophilic molecule, thus
appears to have a limited capacity to cross the bloodebrain barrier (de riu et al., 2001; sechi et al., 2003). we also found that,
at doses of 10 to 15 mg/kg, which were ineffective alone in inducing convulsions, tcc acted as a proconvulsant agent when
injected in association with non-convulsant doses of ptz. furthermore, a non-convulsant dose of tcc (15 mg/kg) potentiated the proconvulsant action of the b-carboline fg 7142.
together, these data demonstrate that tcc is an effective
proconvulsant agent that is able to synergistically potentiate

814

m. carta et al. / neuropharmacology 51 (2006) 805e815

the effects of others antagonists and negative modulators of
gabaars.
5. conclusions
we have shown that tcc is a potent antagonist of gabaar
function. this action is consistent with and may explain the
epileptogenic effects of tcc observed under specific experimental and clinical conditions (de riu et al., 2001; sechi
et al., 2003). in contrast, the mechanisms by which tcc exerts
its myorelaxant and analgesic effects remain to be elucidated.
given that, especially in the spinal cord, tcc binds to additional targets, such as glycine receptors (balduini et al., 1999,
2001), it is likely that this widely used drug induces its therapeutic effects by interacting with various types of neurotransmitter receptor. indeed, the function of rat glycine receptors
expressed in xenopus laevis oocytes appears to be inhibited
by tcc at concentration in the low micromolar range (m.p.
mascia et al., unpublished observations).
