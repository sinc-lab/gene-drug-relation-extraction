abstract
lymphocyte function associated antigen-1 (lfa-1;  xxxg1205xxx / xxxg1209xxx ) is an important mediator of leukocyte migration and t cell activation.
we previously showed that antithymocyte globulin stimulates an independent, non-neuronal cholinergic system in t cells via lfa-1mediated pathways, as evidenced by increases in acetylcholine (ach) synthesis and  xxxg440xxx  (chat) mrna expression. the
cholesterol-lowering drug simvastatin inhibits lfa-1 signaling by binding to an allosteric site on  xxxg1205xxx  ( xxxg1205xxx  chain), which leads to
immunomodulation. in the present study, we investigated whether simvastatin modulates lymphocytic cholinergic activity in t cells. we
found that anti- xxxg1205xxx  monoclonal antibody (mab) increased chat activity, ach synthesis and release, and expression of chat and m5
muscarinic ach receptor mrna in molt-3 cells, a human leukemic t cell line. simvastatin abolished these anti- xxxg1205xxx  mab-induced
increases in lymphocytic cholinergic activity in a manner independent of its cholesterol-lowering activity. these results indicate that lfa-1
contributes to the regulation of lymphocytic cholinergic activity via  xxxg1205xxx -mediated pathways, and suggest that simvastatin exerts its
immunosuppressive effects in part via modification of lymphocytic cholinergic activity.

1. introduction
lymphocytes possess the necessary cholinergic components to constitute an independent, non-neuronal cholinergic
system: t cells contain acetylcholine (ach) in physiologically relevant concentrations and express  xxxg440xxx  (chat), an ach synthesizing enzyme, while
both t and b cells express muscarinic and nicotinic ach
receptors (machrs and nachrs, respectively) and acetylcholinesterase (ache) (see reviews by kawashima and
fujii, 2000, 2003, 2004; fujii and kawashima, 2001b).
stimulation of machrs expressed on t and b cells using
ach or oxotremorine-m (oxo-m) elicits increases in the
intracellular free ca2+ concentration ([ca2+]i) with [ca2+]i
oscillations and up-regulates c-fos expression, suggesting t

cells can be activated via machr-mediated pathways (fujii
and kawashima, 2000a,b). stimulation of nachrs on t and
b cells using nicotine causes rapid and transient increases in
[ca2+]i (kimura et al., 2003). in addition, we have shown (i)
that stimulation of the t cell receptor (tcr)/cd3 complex
using phytohemagglutinin (pha), a t cell activator, induces
ach synthesis and release in two human leukemic t cell
lines (molt-3 and hsb-2 cells) (fujii et al., 1996); (ii) that
pha up-regulates chat transcription and activity in human
mononuclear leukocytes (mnls), comprised mainly of t
and b lymphocytes (fujii et al., 1998); and (iii) that pha
stimulates expression of both machrs and ache (szelenyi
et al., 1987; paldi-haris et al., 1990). collectively, these
findings suggest that ach released from t cells contributes
to the regulation of immune function by modulating the
activities of both t and b cells in an autocrine and/or
paracrine fashion, and that t cell activation is a key
modulator of lymphocytic cholinergic activity.

antithymocyte globulin (atg)-fresenius (atg-f), a rabbit
globulin against human thymocytes, is an immunosuppressive
(bock et al., 1995; passweg et al., 1996; remberger et al.,
1999; fouladi et al., 2000; kojima et al., 2000; tisdale et al.,
2000), that acts via the cd2, cd7 and  xxxg1205xxx  cell surface
molecules, also known as lymphocyte function-associated
antigen 2 ( xxxg377xxx ), an ig superfamily member and lfa-1 alphachain, respectively (remberger et al., 1999). stimulation of
these cell surface molecules using the appropriate monoclonal
antibodies (mabs) activates intracellular signaling pathways
leading to increases in [ca2+]i and modulation of lymphocyte
function (ledbetter et al., 1987; leta et al., 1995). in fact, we
found that in the short term (6 h), atg-f enhanced ach
release from the ccrf-cem (cem) human leukemic t cell
line through transient increases in [ca2+]i mediated by cd7,
which led to declines in intracellular ach content. within 48 h,
however, the ach content was elevated, as compared to the
control, due to up-regulation of chat expression mediated by
 xxxg1205xxx  (fujii et al., 2002). we suggested, therefore, that
stimulation of  xxxg1205xxx  induces activation of the lymphocytic
cholinergic system.
statins are commonly used cholesterol-lowering drugs
that inhibit 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl- xxxd1739xxx 
(hmg-coa) reductase. in addition to their hypocholesterolemic effects, statins also exert immunomodulatory effects;
for instance, they reduce the incidence of chronic rejection in
cardiac (kobashigawa et al., 1995) and renal transplant
recipients (wanner et al., 2000). moreover, simvastatin is a
promising candidate for use in the treatment of multiple
sclerosis (neuhaus et al., 2004). while the mechanisms
involved in the immunomodulatory effects of statins are not
yet fully understood, it is known that statins selectively
inhibit lfa-1( xxxg1205xxx / xxxg1209xxx )-mediated adhesion and costimulation of lymphocytes in a manner independent of their
inhibition of  xxxg1060xxx  activity (weitz-schmidt
et al., 2001). taken together, these findings suggest that
simvastatin modifies lymphocytic cholinergic activity via
 xxxg1205xxx -mediated pathways.
in the present study, we used anti- xxxg1205xxx  mab and the
molt-3 human leukemic t cell line, which served as a t cell
model, to investigate whether simvastatin has the ability to
inhibit lymphocytic cholinergic activity via  xxxg1205xxx  (lfa-1
alpha-chain)-mediated pathways.
2. materials and methods
2.1. chemicals and reagents
the following sense and antisense oligonucleotide
primers were custom synthesized at takara (shigaken,
japan) and used for reverse transcription-polymerase chain
reaction (rt-pcr) analysis of chat (fujii et al., 1998, 1999)
and the m3, m4 and m5 machr subtypes (fujii and kawashima, 2001a): 5′-aagacgcccatcctggaaaag-3′
(chat sense), 5′-tgagacggcggaaattaatgac-3′
(chat antisense), 5′-agccaaacgaacaacaaagag-

3′(m3 sense), 5′-ttgaaggacagaggtagagtg-3′
(m3 anti-sense), 5′-cgctatgagacggtggaaatg-3′
(m4 sense), 5′-cgtcttggctttcttctcctt-3′ (m4
anti-sense), 5′-ggaaacagagaagcgaaccaa-3′ (m5
sense), and 5′-agcacaaccaatagcccaagt-3′ (m5
anti-sense).
rpmi 1640 medium was from nissui seiyaku co., ltd.
(tokyo, japan). simvastatin, diisopropyl  xxxd3217xxx 
(dfp), ach iodide, acetyl  xxxd1739xxx  (accoa), dl-mevalolactone and physostigmine sulfate were all from wako pure
chemicals (osaka, japan). bromoacetylcholine (brach) bromide was from research biochemicals international (natick,
ma). choline chloride was from tokyo kasei (tokyo, japan).
rna bee™ was from teltest (friendswood, tx). superscript™ ii was from invitrogen (carlsbad, ca). fetal calf
serum (fcs) was from gibco brl (grand island, ny). [3h]
ach with a specific activity of 3.02 tbq/mmol and [3h]
accoa with a specific activity of 7.4 tbq/mmol were from
amersham (buckinghamshire, uk) and dupont new england
nuclear (boston, ma), respectively. mouse anti-human
 xxxg1205xxx  (clone 25.3.1, igg1kappa) mab and mouse anti-human
igg2 mab (clone gom1, igg1kappa, immunotech), which served
as a control igg, were from immunotech (cedex, france). all
other reagents used were of reagent grade and purchased from
commercial sources (e.g., wako pure chemicals).
2.2. cell culture
molt-3 cells, a human acute lymphoblastic t cell line that
synthesize and release ach (fujii et al., 1996, 1999, 2002;
horiuchi et al., 2003; suenaga et al., 2004), were obtained
from the fujisaki cell center, hayashibara biochemical inc.
(okayama, japan) and used as a t cell model. the cells were
maintained in culture flasks (corning 2511-75, corning, ny)
in rpmi 1640 medium supplemented with 7% heatinactivated fcs at 37 °c under a humidified atmosphere of
5% co2 in air. cell numbers were counted using a
hemocytometer (reichert, buffalo, ny); their viability was
determined by trypan blue (gibco brl) exclusion.
2.3. measurement of ach using a specific, sensitive
radioimmunoassay (ria)
molt-3 cells (5 × 105 cells) were cultured in medium
containing 1 mum dfp, an ache inhibitor, in the presence or
absence of 2 mug/ml anti- xxxg1205xxx  mab with and without 1 mum
simvastatin. in some experiments, 1 mm dl-mevalolactone
was also added to the medium, where it was converted to the
open-ring product mevalonate (meyers et al., 2003). after
incubating 48 h, the cells were transferred to a centrifuge
tube, pelleted at 300×g for 8 min at 4 °c, and the supernatant
was collected and assayed for ach released into the medium.
the pellet was washed twice with 10 ml of phosphatebuffered saline (pbs) containing 1 mum dfp, then resuspended to 1.0 × 106 cells/ml in pbs containing 1 mum dfp
and assayed for ach stored within cells.

t. fujii et al. / journal of neuroimmunology 179 (2006) 101–107

for the assay, samples (1 ml) of the culture supernatant
or cell suspension were mixed with 500 mul 1.2 n perchloric
acid and homogenized using a ud-201 ultrasonic disruptor
(tomy, tokyo, japan). the homogenate was kept on ice for
15 min and then centrifuged at 27,000 ×g for 30 min at 4 °c
to prepare ach extracts. the ach content of the extracts was
determined by ria using [3h]ach and an antiserum against
ach raised in a rabbit immunized with choline hemiglutarate–bovine  xxxg124xxx  conjugates (kawashima et al.,
1980). this ria is highly specific for ach: its crossreactivity with choline, phosphatidylcholine, and  xxxd2929xxx  is less than 0.012%; the sensitivity of the assay is
3 pg/tube (about 20 fmol/tube). detailed procedures for the
determination of ach in the extract have been described
elsewhere (fujii et al., 1998, 2002; oosawa et al., 1999).
2.4. preparation of total rna for analysis of machrs and
chat mrna expression
molt-3 cells (5 × 106 cells) were cultured in medium
containing 1 mum dfp in the presence or absence of 2 mug/ml
anti- xxxg1205xxx  mab, with and without of 1 mum simvastatin. the
cells were then transferred to centrifuge tubes (corning
25311) (5.0 × 106 cells/tube), pelleted at 300 ×g for 8 min at
4 °c, and washed three times with 10 ml of pbs. total rna
was then extracted from the pellets using rna bee™ b as
previously described (fujii et al., 1998). rna concentrations
and qualities were determined from the absorbance at
260 nm and the ratio of the absorbances at 260 and
280 nm, respectively.
2.5. first strand cdna synthesis and rt-pcr analysis of
machrs and chat mrna expression
first-strand cdna was prepared using 20 mug of total
rna, 50 pmol of random primer p(dn)6 and reverse
transcriptase as described elsewhere (fujii et al., 1998,
1999). as a negative control, reverse transcriptase was
omitted from the reaction mixture in some cases. using a
dna thermal cycler (perkin-elmer cetus, norwalk, ct),
5% of the cdna obtained was amplified in a 50 mul reaction
volume containing 25pmol of the respective sense and antisense primers and amplitaq dna polymerase. for chat,
the amplification protocol entailed 33–40 cycles of denaturation at 94 °c for 1 min, annealing at 62 °c for 1 min and
extension at 72 °c for 2 min. amplification of machrs
entailed 33–40 cycles of 95 °c for 1 min, 60 °c for 2 min
and 72 °c for 3 min, followed by a 15-min final extension at
72 °c. as an internal control for the efficiency of the cdna
amplification, we also amplified  xxxg861xxx  ( xxxg861xxx ) mrna using an appropriate
primer set: 5′-atcaccatcttccaggagcg-3′ ( xxxg861xxx 
sense) and 5′-cctgcttcaccaccttcttg-3′ ( xxxg861xxx 
anti-sense). amplification entailed 21 cycles of 94 °c for
1 min, 60 °c for 1 min and 72 °c for 1 min, followed by a
15-min final extension at 72 °c. the pcr products present

103

in 10 mul of the reaction mixture were then separated
according to size on 2.5% agarose gels and visualized by
ethidium bromide staining. the resultant fluorescent bands
were digitized and quantified using a luminous imager
(aisin cosmos r&d co. ltd., aichi, japan). although our
rt-pcr analysis was not strictly quantitative, relative
changes in mrna expression were detectable since the
same amount of total rna was used in each amplification.
the machr/ xxxg861xxx  and chat/ xxxg861xxx  ratios were
expressed as percentages of control.
2.6. measurement of chat activity
chat activity in molt-3 cells after various treatments
was determined using a modification of the procedure of
fonnum (1975). because ach is synthesized by both chat
and, to a lesser extent,  xxxg513xxx  (carat)
(fujii et al., 1996) in molt-3 cells, ach synthetic activity
was assayed in the presence and absence of 10 mum brach, a
specific chat inhibitor (tuèek, 1982). all assays were
carried out in duplicate. the cells were washed twice with
30 ml of pbs, resuspended in 24 mm sodium phosphate
buffer (ph 7.4) containing 24 mm mgcl2, 200 mm nacl
and 1.2% triton x-100, and homogenized using a ud-201
disruptor. the homogenates were then centrifuged at
27,000×g for 30 min at 4 °c to prepare the enzyme extracts.
a 50-mul sample of the extract was incubated for 120 min at
37 °c with 100 mul of the assay mixture (0.15 mm [3h]
accoa, 24 mm sodium phosphate buffer, ph 7.4, 15 mm
choline chloride, 0.15 mm physostigmine), after which the
reaction was terminated by placing the tubes on ice and
adding 500 mul ice-cold pbs. the ach formed was extracted
with sodium tetraphenyl borate into a toluene-based
scintillation cocktail containing acetonitrile, and the radioactivity was measured using a liquid scintillation counter (ls
6500, beckman, columbia, md). chat activity was
calculated by subtracting the ach synthesizing activity
determined in the presence of br ach from that determined
in the absence of brach.
the protein concentration in the enzyme extract was
determined by the method of bradford (1976), using bovine
 xxxg124xxx  as a standard.
2.7. statistical analysis
all values are expressed as means ± sem. statistical
comparisons between the control and treatment groups
were carried out using one-way analysis of variance
(anova) followed by a post hoc modified t-test (tukey's
test), as appropriate. values of p < 0.05 were considered
significant.
3. results
given the known effects of anti- xxxg1205xxx  mab on
lymphocytic cholinergic activity (fujii et al., 2002), we

104

t. fujii et al. / journal of neuroimmunology 179 (2006) 101–107

examined the effects of simvastatin (final concentration,
1 mum) by adding it to molt-3 cells cultures, with and
without anti- xxxg1205xxx  mab. then after incubating 48 h,
samples of cells and conditioned media were collected for
assay. the concentration of simvastatin (1 mum) was selected
based on the ki (1.8 mum) with which simvastatin blocks the
binding of lfa-1 to icam-1 (weitz-schmidt et al., 2001).
3.1. effects of simvastatin and anti- xxxg1205xxx  mab on
proliferation
by themselves, neither simvastatin nor anti- xxxg1205xxx  mab
significantly affected the proliferation of molt-3 cells (fig.
1), which indicates that at a concentration of 1 mum,
simvastatin has no toxic effects on molt-3 cells. in
combination, however, the two tended to inhibit cell
proliferation, as compared to anti- xxxg1205xxx  mab alone, but
the effect was not statistically significant.
3.2. effects of simvastatin and anti- xxxg1205xxx  mab on ach
content and release
fig. 1. effects of simvastatin and anti- xxxg1205xxx  mab on proliferation of
molt-3 cells. cell viability was determined by trypan blue exclusion,
and the cells were counted using a hemocytometer. the calculation of cell
number was performed in duplicate. initially, 5 × 105 molt-3 cells were
plated. the columns respectively represent means ± sem (n = 9) for cells
incubated for 48 h with mouse igg (2 mug/ml; control), simvastatin
(1 mum), anti- xxxg1205xxx  mab (2 mug/ml) or simvastatin + anti- xxxg1205xxx  mab.

as shown in fig. 2a and b, anti- xxxg1205xxx  mab
significantly (p < 0.01) increased both the ach content of
molt-3 cells and its release into the culture medium,
whereas simvastatin had no effect on ach content or its
release. on the other hand, simvastatin completely blocked
the enhancement of ach content and release evoked by anticd11a mab.

(b) were measured using a specific ria. all assays were carried out in duplicate. data are means ± sem (n = 3). ⁎⁎p < 0.01 vs. control (tukey's test).

3.3. effects of simvastatin and anti- xxxg1205xxx  mab on
expression for chat and machr mrna
similarly, anti- xxxg1205xxx  mab significantly (p < 0.05) upregulated chat mrna expression (fig. 3a, compare lanes
1 and 3; fig. 3b), whereas simvastatin had no effect on the
expression of chat mrna (fig. 3a, compare lanes 1 and
2; fig. 3b). but when added to the culture medium along
with anti- xxxg1205xxx  mab, simvastatin completely blocked anticd11a mab-induced chat mrna expression (fig. 3a,
compare lanes 3 and 4; fig. 3b). likewise, simvastatin
significantly (p < 0.01) diminished anti- xxxg1205xxx  mabinduced expression of m5 machr mrna (fig. 3a and
e). by contrast, neither simvastatin nor anti- xxxg1205xxx  mab
had any effect on expression of m3 or m4 machr mrna
(fig. 3c and d).
3.4. effects of simvastatin and anti- xxxg1205xxx  mab on chat
activity
consistent with its effects on chat expression and ach
content and release, anti- xxxg1205xxx  mab significantly
enhanced chat-catalyzed ach synthesis in molt-3
cells, as compared to control (fig. 4). and consistent with
all of the results summarized above, simvastatin alone did
not affect basal chat activity, but did abolish the anticd11a mab-induced enhancement of that activity.

48 h with mouse igg (2 mug/ml; control), simvastatin (1 mum), anti- xxxg1205xxx 
mab (2 mug/ml) or simvastatin + anti- xxxg1205xxx  mab. the expected sizes of the
chat, m3, m4, m5 machr and  xxxg861xxx  rt-pcr products were 652, 846,
648, 800 and 574 bp, respectively. (a) rt-pcr representative of three

3.5. effects of mevalonate on lymphocytic cholinergic
activity in the presence of simvastatin and anti- xxxg1205xxx  mab
mevalolactone is a reaction intermediate produced by
 xxxg1060xxx  and is converted to the open-ring
product mevalonate (meyers et al., 2003). in order to
investigate whether inhibition of  xxxg1060xxx  by
simvastatin is involved in its modulation of lymphocytic
cholinergic activity, we added dl-mevalolactone (1 mm) to
the incubation media. we found, however, that dlmevalolactone had no effect on intracellular ach content
or on ach release in untreated molt-3 cells or those treated
with simvastatin in combination with anti- xxxg1205xxx  mab (data
not shown).
4. discussion
one of the main objectives of the present study was to
identify substances that affect lymphocytic cholinergic
activity via  xxxg1205xxx -mediated pathways. our results provide
the first evidence that simvastatin attenuates lymphocytic
cholinergic activity via  xxxg1205xxx -mediated pathways.
we confirmed that anti- xxxg1205xxx  mab stimulates ach
synthesis and release and up-regulates chat gene expression in molt-3 cells, which we previously showed to
synthesize ach via chat (fujii et al., 1995) and to express
the m3, m4 and m5 machrs (sato et al., 1999). the present
results also are in line with our earlier findings that
stimulation of  xxxg1205xxx  with atg-f or anti- xxxg1205xxx  mab
increased synthesis of ach and expression of chat mrna
in the cem t cell line (fujii et al., 2002). furthermore, as
 xxxg1205xxx  acts in conjunction with the tcr/cd3 complex to
mediate transmembrane signaling leading to t cell activation
(carrera et al., 1988; kanner et al., 1993), it seems likely that
a costimulatory pathway – perhaps one activated by cell-tocell adhesion or aggregation of cell surface molecules, such
as occurs with cd28 on t cells or  xxxg396xxx / xxxg398xxx  on antigen
presenting cells (apcs) (carreno and collins, 2002) – is also
involved in anti- xxxg1205xxx  mab-induced enhancement of chat
expression and ach synthesis in vivo.
simvastatin and statin derivatives are thought to be
prospective immunosuppressive agents (neuhaus et al.,
2004). consistent with that idea, the results of the present
study demonstrate, for the first time, that simvastatin inhibits
the anti- xxxg1205xxx  mab-induced increases in the synthesis and
release of ach and the expression of chat and m5 machr
mrnas in molt-3 cells. that these effects of simvastatin
were not reversed by mevalolactone indicates simvastatin
antagonized the anti- xxxg1205xxx  mab-induced facilitation of
lymphocytic cholinergic activity via a pathway other than by
inhibition of mevalonate synthesis. weitz-schmidt et al.
(2001) showed that statins block the binding of lfa-1 to
icam-1, suggesting that statins exert their immunomodulatory effects in part through inhibition of t cell interaction
with apcs (weitz-schmidt et al., 2001). it thus seems likely
that the observed inhibition of lymphocytic cholinergic

activity by simvastatin is related to its immunomodulatory
effects, since the interaction of t cells with apcs facilitates
lymphocytic cholinergic transmission via  xxxg1205xxx -mediated
pathways (fujii and kawashima, 2003).
stimulation with ach or machr agonists elicits a
variety of functional and biochemical changes in t and b
cells, including increases in t cell-dependent antibody
production and cytotoxicity, increases in [ca2+]i, and
increases in ip3 and cgmp formation (see a review by
kawashima and fujii, 2000). in that regard, zimring et al.
(2005) recently used an m1 machr-deficient mouse,
whose t cells have a defect in the ability to differentiate
into cytolytic cells, to demonstrate that the m1 machr
plays a key role in the generation of cd8+ cytolytic t
cells. in addition, we have shown that anti- xxxg1205xxx  mab
specifically up-regulates m5 machr mrna expression
(fujii et al., 2002), as does stimulation of t cells with
pha or atg-f and stimulation of b cells with staphylococcus aureus cow i (fujii et al., 2003). apparently,
signal transduction via m5 machrs is preferentially
enhanced during immune responses mediated via stimulation of cell surface molecules, though the mechanism by
which that occurs is not yet known. although it remains to
be confirmed whether m5 machr function is enhanced by
the binding of mab to  xxxg1205xxx , it would be interesting to
investigate the role of m5 machrs in the regulation of
immune cell function.
in conclusion, simvastatin abolishes the anti- xxxg1205xxx 
mab-induced enhancement of ach synthesis and release
mediated via up-regulation of chat gene expression in
molt-3 cells. this suggests that the immunosuppressive
effect of simvastatin is related, at least in part, to the
inhibition of lymphocytic cholinergic activity induced by
stimulation of lfa-1.
