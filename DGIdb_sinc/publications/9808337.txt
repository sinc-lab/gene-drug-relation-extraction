comt inhibition
in the treatment of parkinson’s disease

abstract a new approach in the
treatment of parkinson’s disease is
the inhibition of  xxxg487xxx  (comt) with new generation comt inhibitors,  xxxd2000xxx 
and  xxxd3395xxx .  xxxd2000xxx  acts mainly peripherally whereas  xxxd3395xxx 
acts both peripherally and centrally.
they induce a dose-dependent inhibition of comt activity in erythrocytes and a significant decrease in
the plasma levels of 3-o-methyldopa, indicating their effectiveness
as comt inhibitors. consequently,
they increase the elimination half-life
of levodopa and thus prolong the
availability of levodopa to the brain
without significantly affecting the
cmax or tmax of levodopa. clinically,
the improved levodopa availability is
seen as prolonged motor response to
levodopa/ddc inhibitor and also as
prolonged duration of dyskinesias in
parkinson’s disease patients with
end-of-dose fluctuations. the dyskinesias are managed by decreasing
the daily levodopa dose in parkinson’s disease patients with end-ofdose fluctuations. both pharmaco-

introduction
levodopa ( xxxd2471xxx ) is still the most
effective therapeutic agent for the treatment of parkinson’s disease (pd). however, levodopa is not an ideal
drug. it has a short plasma elimination half-life of 1–2 h
[14, 38] owing to its abundant and rapid peripheral me-

kinetically and clinically the 200-mg
dose of  xxxd2000xxx  is the most effective dose compared with placebo.
for  xxxd3395xxx  100 and 200 mg have
most often proved to be the optimal
doses. based on the duration of
comt inhibition  xxxd2000xxx  is administered with each levodopa/ddc
inhibitor dose whereas  xxxd3395xxx  is
given three times daily. both  xxxd2000xxx  and  xxxd3395xxx  are well-tolerated. however, there seems to be a
trend for  xxxd3395xxx  to induce more
often diarrhoea and increase in liver
transaminases compared with  xxxd2000xxx . thus, comt inhibitors are
clinically significant and beneficial
adjunct to levodopa therapy in
parkinson’s disease patients with
end-of-dose fluctuations. their effects and significance also in the
treatment of de novo patients need
to be clarified.

tabolism. only a small fraction of an oral levodopa dose
reaches the brain for decarboxylation to dopamine (da)
[35]. in addition, after a few years the clinical responses
of many parkinsonian patients become critically dependent on brain levels of levodopa, and end-of-dose fluctuations to levodopa emerge [30, 43]. decreased storage capacity of da in the presynaptic dopaminergic neurons or
postsynaptic changes may play a pathogenetic role in the

p26

development of motor fluctuations [52]. various means to
extend the effect of levodopa have therefore been developed. one means is to inhibit the levodopa-metabolizing
enzymes. levodopa has two main metabolic pathways: decarboxylation (70%) and o-methylation (10%) [37]. for
example,  xxxg618xxx  (ddc) is routinely inhibited
in levodopa therapy. another, new means is to inhibit omethylation, the other main metabolic route of levodopa,
by inhibitors of  xxxg487xxx  (comt).
comt ( xxxg487xxx ) is an intracellular enzyme that is
widely distributed in the peripheral tissues. the highest
levels of activity are in the liver, kidney and intestinal
tract [20, 36, 45]. only a small proportion of levodopa is
o-methylated by central comt in the brain. the substrates of comt include levodopa, catecholamines
(dopamine, noradrenaline and adrenaline), catecholestrogens, and some drugs, e.g. benserazide, carbidopa, dobutamide and  xxxd2398xxx  [17, 36]. since the endogenous
catecholamines are substrates for comt, interactions between comt inhibition and endogenous or exogenous
catecholamines are theoretically possible.
in the levodopa treatment of parkinson’s disease, peripheral ddc ( xxxg618xxx ) is almost invariably inhibited,
either with benserazide [(±)-dc-seryl-2-(2,3,4-trihydroxybenzyl)hydrazine] or carbidopa [(–)-l-alpha-hydrazino-3,4dihydroxy-alpha-methylbenzenepropanoic acid]. after ddc
inhibition, the metabolic profile of levodopa is altered in
two ways. firstly, less levodopa is metabolized to dopamine in the periphery [55], and secondly, more levodopa
is shifted to the comt pathway [13, 32, 55]. ddc inhibitors double the bioavailability of levodopa [55].
comt enzyme catalyzes the o-methylation of levodopa to yield 3-o-methyldopa (3-omd). 3-omd has a
long elimination half-life of 15–18 h [12, 26], which leads
to the accumulation of 3-omd during chronic levodopa
treatment. by inhibiting both the peripheral comt enzyme and the peripheral ddc, we can further improve the
availability of levodopa in the brain for decarboxylation.
two nitrocatechol-structured compounds from the new
generation comt inhibitors, developed in the late 1980s,
are being introduced for the treatment of pd as an adjunct
to levodopa/ddc inhibitor: the mainly peripherally acting
 xxxd2000xxx  [4] and both peripherally and centrally acting
 xxxd3395xxx  [5].

pharmacokinetics and metabolism of comt inhibitors
 xxxd2000xxx 
 xxxd2000xxx  [(e)-2-cyano-n,n-diethyl-3-(3,4-dihydroxy5-nitrophenyl)propenamide,  xxxd2000xxx , orion pharma, finland] is an effective, selective, reversible and a peripheral
comt inhibitor. the pharmacokinetics and metabolism
of  xxxd2000xxx  have been investigated both in healthy controls and in pd patients.

 xxxd2000xxx  shows dose-proportional pharmacokinetics over a dose range from 5 to 800 mg in healthy controls
[24]. the cmax and the area under the plasma concentration-time curve (auc) of  xxxd2000xxx  are dose-related
[24, 47].  xxxd2000xxx  is rapidly absorbed, with a time of
maximal concentration (tmax) of 44 min for a 200-mg dose
of  xxxd2000xxx  (range from 28 min to 53 min for 5–800
mg, respectively). its systemic availability is between 29
and 46%. the systemic availability increases with the
dose, and the tmax tends to be prolonged after increasing
 xxxd2000xxx  doses [24, 47], suggesting a tendency towards
slowed absorption of  xxxd2000xxx  with increasing doses.
 xxxd2000xxx  is eliminated by metabolic (non-renal) route
and is metabolized mainly in the liver. it has a short elimination half-life (t ⁄ el). the beta-phase of the t ⁄ el is 0.3–0.5 h
and the gamma-phase 2.5–3.4 h after i.v. administration in
healthy volunteers (korpela, 1998, personal communication). after oral administration, the t ⁄ beta of  xxxd2000xxx  is
0.5–0.7 h (90% of elimination of  xxxd2000xxx ) and the t ⁄ gamma
2.4–3.5 h (10% of elimination of  xxxd2000xxx ) [24; gordin
1998, personal communication]. the total plasma clearance of  xxxd2000xxx  is 750 ml/min [24]
the main matabolite of  xxxd2000xxx  (which itself is an
e-isomer) in human plasma is the z-isomer of  xxxd2000xxx 
[58]. the auc of the z-isomer accounts for only 5% of
the total auc of both isomers [47]. the z-isomer is as effective a comt inhibitor in vitro as  xxxd2000xxx , but owing the low plasma levels in humans, the z-isomer barely
contributes to the  xxxd2000xxx -induced comt inhibition.
about 10% of an oral dose of  xxxd2000xxx  is excreted into
the urine mainly as glucuronides of  xxxd2000xxx  and its zisomer. thus, more of  xxxd2000xxx  seems to be eliminated
by biliary than by urinary excretion [58]. although  xxxd2000xxx  has a catechol-structure, it is a poor substrate for
human comt [4, 58].

 xxxd3395xxx 
 xxxd3395xxx  (3,4-dihydroxy-4′-methyl-5-nitrobenzophenone,
 xxxd3395xxx , f. hoffmann-la roche ltd, basel, switzerland) is also an effective, reversible and selective comt
inhibitor, which is considered both a peripherally and centrally acting comt inhibitor [59].
 xxxd3395xxx  shows linear and stable pharmacokinetics
up to 200 mg t.i.d. the peak concentration of  xxxd3395xxx  is
achieved about 2 h (range 1–3.1) after administration of a
200-mg dose of  xxxd3395xxx  [10–12, 19, 54]. the systemic
bioavailability of  xxxd3395xxx  has been reported to be much
better than that of  xxxd2000xxx  [10]. it is rapidly eliminated, with a t ⁄ el of 2 h after a single oral 200-mg dose,
ranging from 1.7 h for 5 mg to 3.4 h for 800 mg [10, 11,
54]. during multiple dosing of 400–800 mg, some change
in clearance of  xxxd3395xxx  is seen, which results in prolongation of t ⁄ el up to 19.0 h after an 800-mg dose t.i.d. and
accumulation of  xxxd3395xxx  [12, 19]. about 3% of tol1

capone is o-methylated into 3-o-methyltolcapone (ro
40-7591) [8], which has a very poor comt inhibitory activity in vitro and ex vivo. the t ⁄ el for 3-o-methyltolcapone is dose-independent, ranging from 30 to 40 h.
however, only minor accumulation of 3-o-methyltolcapone occurred, owing to suppression of its formation by
 xxxd3395xxx  [10–12, 19].  xxxd3395xxx  also has two oxidated
metabolites present in low concentrations in plasma [8].
both are equipotent to  xxxd3395xxx  in vitro and in vivo.
they barely contribute to the inhibitory effect of  xxxd3395xxx , since their concentration is less than 3% of that of
 xxxd3395xxx  [8]. about 30% of  xxxd3395xxx  is conjugated to
glucuronides, which do not inhibit comt.

pharmacodynamics of comt inhibitors
activity of  xxxg487xxx  (s = soluble) in erythrocytes is a
pharmacodynamic parameter to assess the effect of comt
inhibitors. erythrocyte  xxxg487xxx  activity reflects the activity of comt in the liver, kidney and lung [6, 57]. thus,
determination of  xxxg487xxx  activity in erythrocytes is considered an easily accessible method to evaluate systemic
comt inhibition.

capone 200 mg t.i.d. during levodopa/carbidopa administration induced around an 80% maximum comt inhibition in erythrocytes in elderly healthy subjects [19].

pharmacokinetic responses to comt inhibitor
as an adjunct to levodopa treatment
 xxxd2000xxx 
in healthy volunteers,  xxxd2000xxx  dose-dependently increases the auc of levodopa by decreasing the metabolic
loss of levodopa to 3-omd [23]. largely similar results
have been obtained in a study with controlled-release levodopa-carbidopa administered with  xxxd2000xxx  to healthy
persons [2].  xxxd2000xxx  seems to improve the bioavailability of levodopa slightly more with standard than with
controlled-release levodopa, probably owing to different
absorption profiles:  xxxd2000xxx  is already almost eliminated before the cmax of controlled-release levodopa is
reached [2].
our dose-finding study [47] shows that on a pharmacokinetic basis the most effective  xxxd2000xxx  dose is 200 mg
compared with placebo in pd patients: the 200-mg dose
of  xxxd2000xxx  induces the highest increase both in the
t ⁄ el of levodopa by 39% (25 min) and in the auc0–4 h of
levodopa by 23% compared with the placebo. neither the
t ⁄ el nor the auc0–4 h of levodopa increases further with the
400-mg dose of  xxxd2000xxx .
in other studies in pd patients,  xxxd2000xxx  also slows
the elimination of levodopa from plasma.  xxxd2000xxx  increases the t ⁄ el of levodopa significantly by 32–75%
(20–56 min) after a 200-mg dose of  xxxd2000xxx  [31, 33,
39, 49]. consequently, the auc of levodopa increases
significantly by 29–48% after a single 200-mg dose of  xxxd2000xxx  [21, 33, 39, 48], and by 21–52% after repeated
 xxxd2000xxx  dosing [21, 22, 29, 39, 48, 49]. the cmax and
tmax of levodopa remained virtually unaffected after the
200-mg dose of  xxxd2000xxx  [2, 21, 29, 31, 39, 47–49].
however, there was a trend for the cmax to decrease (ns)
[22, 33], the tmax to be delayed after a 200-mg dose [23,
33, 48], and there was a significant delay in the tmax in the
studies by merello et al. [31] and kaakkola et al. [22]. in
one study, the tmax even slightly decreased (ns) after 8
weeks on  xxxd2000xxx  [39]. although the cmax of levodopa
is not increased after a single dose of  xxxd2000xxx , repeated  xxxd2000xxx  dosing results in increased interdose
trough levodopa concentrations during 1 day and decreased
variability in levodopa concentrations [39].
repeated administration of a 200-mg dose of  xxxd2000xxx  along with each levodopa dose decreases the
plasma 3-omd levels by 43–63% [21, 22, 29, 39, 48, 49].
single doses of  xxxd2000xxx  do not usually influence the
plasma 3-omd levels in levodopa-treated patients [21,
33, 48, 49] since the 3-omd level is rather high and stable in chronic levodopa therapy owing to the long half-life

 xxxd2000xxx  has been shown to be an effective inhibitor of
comt both in healthy volunteers [2, 24] and in pd patients [29, 47]. there is a clear and significant correlation
between plasma  xxxd2000xxx  levels and the inhibition of scomt activity in erythrocytes, the correlation coefficient
being 0.995 (p < 0.001) [24]. the inhibition of  xxxg487xxx 
in erythrocytes, caused by  xxxd2000xxx , is rapid and dosedependent: with a 200-mg dose the inhibition is 65%,
and the highest 800-mg dose of  xxxd2000xxx  yields a
maximal inhibition of 82%, determined 1 h after  xxxd2000xxx  intake without concomitant levodopa [24]. in pd
patients 1 h after administration of 200 mg of  xxxd2000xxx 
and levodopa/ddc inhibitor, the inhibition is 38% [29,
48]. the erythrocyte  xxxg487xxx  activity recovers within 8
h of the doses of 5–800 mg of  xxxd2000xxx , and within 6–8
h the activity of  xxxg487xxx  is recovered after a 200-mg
dose of  xxxd2000xxx .
 xxxd3395xxx 
in healthy controls, single  xxxd3395xxx  doses of 5–800 mg
cause a dose-dependent comt inhibition in erythrocytes:
a dose as low as 5 mg causes a 20% inhibition, a 200-mg
dose induces an 80% inhibition, whereas an 800-mg dose
causes about 90% inhibition for about 4 h [10–12]. complete recovery of comt activity occurs at 24 h after the
doses of 5–800 mg [10, 60, 61]. repeated dosing of tol-

of 3-omd [13, 26]. the auc of 3-omd is therefore often reduced not after a single dose but after repeated  xxxd2000xxx  dosing. the auc of dihydroxyphenylacetic acid
(dopac) increases by 77–245% [22, 29, 33, 47, 49] after
single and repeated dosing with 200 mg of  xxxd2000xxx .
the auc of homovanillic acid (hva) decreases significantly by 17–33% both after the first and after repeated
dosing with 200 mg of  xxxd2000xxx  [21, 22, 29, 31, 47– 49].
the increased auc of dopac and the decreased auc of
hva presumably reflect improved peripheral comt inhibition.
selegiline coadministered with levodopa/benserazide
and  xxxd2000xxx  did not affect the t ⁄ el or the auc of levodopa or the decrease in the auc of hva, but selegiline
attenuated the  xxxd2000xxx -induced increase in the auc of
dopac [29]. possibly, da metabolism was shifted towards the comt-dependent pathway or sulfate-conjugation of da.

 xxxd3395xxx 
another comt inhibitor,  xxxd3395xxx , has induced qualitatively nearly similar changes in pharmacokinetics of
levodopa compared with  xxxd2000xxx . the differences are
mainly quantitative,  xxxd3395xxx  inducing a longer-lasting
comt inhibition in erythrocytes compared with  xxxd2000xxx . in healthy volunteers, single graded doses of  xxxd3395xxx  (10–800 mg) dose-dependently decrease the auc
of 3-omd and for levodopa double the t ⁄ el and the auc
without virtually affecting the cmax or tmax [11, 54]. however, higher  xxxd3395xxx  doses of 400–800 mg tend to prolong absorption of levodopa, the delay in tmax of levodopa
being significant after the 800-mg dose of  xxxd3395xxx  [11,
54]. the maximum, nearly twofold, increase in the t ⁄ el
and auc of levodopa is achieved at doses 100–200 mg of
 xxxd3395xxx  [11, 54]. multiple dosing with  xxxd3395xxx  200
mg t.i.d. increases the t ⁄ el of levodopa by 17–68% (18–78
min) and the auc of levodopa by 33–64% without systematic differences during 1-week dosing in elderly
healthy subjects [12, 19]. the 800-mg dose of  xxxd3395xxx 
t.i.d. decreases the auc of 3-omd by up to 98% and
200 mg t.i.d. by 64-93% [12, 19]. the effect of  xxxd3395xxx  is maintained throughout 1 week’s multiple dosing [12, 19].

fluorodopa pet response to comt inhibition
the influences of comt inhibition on peripheral and
central levodopa metabolism have been investigated with
positron emission tomography (pet) using 6-[18f]fluorodopa (18f-dopa). pet can be applied to examining the
function of the dopaminergic system in pd and the effect
of drug treatment on striatal dopaminergic function.
18f-dopa qualitatively behaves in vivo very similarly to

levodopa, and the striatum handles 6-[18f]fluorodopamine
(18f-dopamine), the decarboxylation product of 18f-dopa,
very similarly to endogenous dopamine.
peripherally,  xxxd2000xxx  induces a significant decrease
by 47–66% in the auc of 3-omfd, a comt-dependent
metabolite of 18f-dopa [51]. correspondingly,  xxxd2000xxx 
induces a significant increase in the auc of unmetabolized 18f-dopa by 28–37% [51] and in the fractions of 18fdopa to 2.5– to 3-fold [18, 50, 51, 53]. thus,  xxxd2000xxx 
increases the plasma level of 18f-dopa available for decarboxylation to the brain.
in the brain, the  xxxd2000xxx -induced improved 18fdopa availability is seen as increased 18f-dopa accumulation by 25–45% in the caudate nucleus and by 29–54%
in the putamen in healthy controls and early pd patients [18, 50, 51, 53] measured with the occipital influx constant (kiocc), which uses the radioactivity concentration in the reference region (occipital region) as an input function [7, 41]. the kiocc reflects mainly the level of
free 18f-dopa in the striatum and its decarboxylation to
18f-dopamine. in levodopa-treated pd patients, the increase in the kiocc values is 22% in the caudate nucleus and
26% in the putamen after  xxxd2000xxx  administration [51],
and in pd patients with end-of-dose fluctuations the increase is 14% in the caudate nucleus (p < 0.05) but only
2% (ns) in the putamen [50]. the striatal 18f-dopa accumulation increases in the same proportion as the auc of
unmetabolized 18f-dopa in plasma in healthy controls and
early pd patients. the striatal 18f-dopa accumulation also
increases in levodopa-treated pd patients, but less than
the auc of unmetabolized 18f-dopa concentration in
plasma, as indicated by the smaller increase in their kiocc
values in proportion to the 18f-dopa availability [51]. the
lower increase in the striatal 18f-dopa uptake in the levodopa-treated and severely diseased, fluctuating pd patients after  xxxd2000xxx  administration is presumably owing to decreased overall ability to convert 18f-dopa to 18fdopamine and to store the 18f-dopamine available.
thus, the pet findings form a background for clinical response to comt inhibition with  xxxd2000xxx  in the
treatment of pd.

clinical responses to comt inhibitor
as an adjunct to levodopa therapy
the clinical effects of comt inhibitors have often been
studied using the levodopa test [15]. the clinical response
to levodopa/ddc inhibitor is scored frequently, for example with various rating scales [e.g. the unified parkinson’s
disease rating scale (updrs) or the columbia university rating scale] [16], global assessment, with tapping
and walking test, and often also with the dyskinesia scale,
without and with the study medication. a summary of
clinical responses to comt inhibitors as an adjunct to
levodopa is presented in tables 1, 2.

 xxxd2000xxx 
the effects of  xxxd2000xxx  have mainly been studied in pd
patients with end-of-dose fluctuations. since the t ⁄ beta of  xxxd2000xxx  (~ 1 h in pd patients) [33] is relatively near that
of levodopa (1–2 h) after oral administration [12, 14, 19,
38] and there is a good correlation between the comt inhibition in erythrocytes and the concentration of  xxxd2000xxx  in plasma, their coadministration appears rational.
 xxxd2000xxx  is therefore given with each levodopa dose.
according to the clinical dose-finding study, the
highest and significant increase both in the on time and
in the duration of dyskinesias was achieved with the 200mg dose of  xxxd2000xxx  compared with placebo in pd patients with end-of-dose fluctuations [47] (table 3). the
on time increased by 33 min (21%), and the duration of

dyskinesias by 45 min (32%) after the 200-mg dose of  xxxd2000xxx . the 400 mg of  xxxd2000xxx  did not further increase the duration of motor response. the 30-min prolongation in on time after each levodopa dose can be
considered a clinically significant achievement to stabilize end-of-dose fluctuations in disability.
in other clinical studies, the single 200-mg oral dose of
 xxxd2000xxx  has also significantly prolonged the duration
of motor response to levodopa (on time) by 18–66 min in
open studies [22, 39, 49]. in a double-blind 4-week, crossover study  xxxd2000xxx  caused a 34-min (24%) increase in

uprds scores [31]. the 200-mg dose of  xxxd2000xxx  did
not significantly change the magnitude, onset, or peak latency of the motor response or dyskinesias, which is in accordance with the virtually unchanged cmax and tmax [47, 49].
the prolonged motor response presumably to each levodopa dose was reflected as a clinically significant 2.1 h

–0.13

–1.02

increase in the total daily on time, as reported by the pd
patients with end-of-dose fluctuations in their home diaries [49].
recent large studies have shown a long-lasting efficacy of  xxxd2000xxx . in long-term studies, the parkinson
study group [40] and rinne et al. [44] reported an in-

p31

crease in daily on time of 1 h (8%) and of 1.2 h (13%) respectively, in pd patients with end-of-dose fluctuations
assessed with patients’ home diaries in 6-month doubleblind studies. correspondingly, the mean daily off-time
was reduced significantly by 1.3 h (–22%) more in the
 xxxd2000xxx  group than in the placebo group [44]. the
global evaluation, the activities of daily living (adl) subscore of the updrs and the mean total motor score of
the updrs also improved significantly after  xxxd2000xxx 
[44]. similarly, in the study by the parkinson study group
[40], there was a trend towards improvement in the adl
and mean total motor subscore after  xxxd2000xxx .
compatibly with the prolonged t ⁄ el of levodopa and on
time,  xxxd2000xxx  prolonged the duration of dyskinesias
[47– 49]. the unchanged magnitude and starting time of
dyskinesias (table 1) are also in accordance with the virtually unchanged cmax and tmax of levodopa. there has
been a trend for the magnitude of dyskinesias to increase
in some studies [31, 39], and the frequency of dyskinesias
increased according to the home diaries [40]. the dyskinesias are controlled by decreasing the mean daily levodopa dose [39, 40, 44, 48, 49].
 xxxd2000xxx  thus results in a reduction of the total daily
levodopa requirement [39, 40, 44, 48, 49]. however, despite lower levodopa doses, the mean plasma levodopa
levels were higher [39] and the duration of motor response
prolonged during  xxxd2000xxx  treatment [39, 48, 49]. by
slowing the elimination of levodopa,  xxxd2000xxx  increased
the daily interdose trough levodopa concentrations and reduced variability in daily plasma levodopa concentrations
as shown by nutt et al. [39]. thus,  xxxd2000xxx  not only
increases on time but may also smoothen motor fluctuations in disability and decrease their development.

 xxxd3395xxx 
the clinical effects of  xxxd3395xxx  have been investigated
not only in patients with end-of-dose fluctuations, but also
in non-fluctuating pd patients. the dose-response relationship has not been systematically unambiguous and
clear with  xxxd3395xxx  [25, 42, 46]. as far as therapeutic responses are concerned in humans, the inhibition of peripheral o-methylation induced by  xxxd3395xxx  is presumably far more important than central comt inhibition.
single doses of  xxxd3395xxx  increased the duration of motor
response to levodopa/benserazide by 55–62 min (65%;
200 mg) and by 72 min (77%; 400 mg) in fluctuating pd
patients assessed on the motor updrs scoring during a
levodopa test in a double-blind manner [27, 28]. another
single-dose double-blind study showed that 50, 100 and
400 mg of  xxxd3395xxx  significantly extended the clinical response to levodopa/carbidopa assessed with the columbia
rating scale [46].  xxxd3395xxx  did not affect the magnitude
or the onset latency of motor response [27, 28, 46], but
higher  xxxd3395xxx  doses of 200 and 400 mg significantly

delayed the peak latency by some 30 min [46].  xxxd3395xxx 
increased the duration and/or magnitude of dyskinesias
[9, 27, 28, 46].
during long-term double-blind studies in pd patients
with end-of-dose fluctuations,  xxxd3395xxx  200 mg t.i.d. increased the daily on time by 0.3–2.1 h (4–34%) according to home diaries [1, 3, 25, 34], but the magnitude of
motor response remained unchanged [25, 42]. correspondingly, the daily off time reduced by 1.5 h measured with
the investigator’s on/off rating scale [25] or by 1.8–
4.2 h measured with home diaries [1, 3, 34, 42]. mean
daily levodopa dosages were decreased by 21–32 mg
(6–8%) at  xxxd3395xxx  doses of 100–200 mg t.i.d. in stable
pd patients [56], and by 109–166 mg (16–21%) at  xxxd3395xxx  dosing of 100 mg t.i.d. [3, 42], and by 80–207 mg
(12–26%) at  xxxd3395xxx  dosing of 200 mg t.i.d. in fluctuating patients [1, 3, 25, 34, 42]. waters et al. [56] reported
that fewer patients in the  xxxd3395xxx  group developed motor fluctuations during the study period compared with the
placebo group among non-fluctuating pd patients.

adverse events
 xxxd2000xxx 
in general,  xxxd2000xxx  coadministered with levodopa/
ddc inhibitor has been well tolerated both in healthy
controls and in pd patients [2, 21–23, 31, 33, 39]. mild
and transient adverse events, such as dizziness, headache,
fatigue, lack of appetite, epigastric pain, nausea, loose
stools or diarrhoea, have been reported in some patients.
most adverse effects are due to increased dopaminergic
stimulation. neither supine and standing blood pressure
nor heart rate were significantly affected by  xxxd2000xxx 
treatment, although  xxxd2000xxx  tended to slightly decrease the mean systolic supine blood pressure and increase the supine heart rate [22].  xxxd2000xxx  did not provoke any clinically significant changes in electrocardiograms or on the clinical haematological and biochemical
variables. most patients observed their urine turn temporarily dark yellow or orange, which was owing to the
colour of  xxxd2000xxx  and its metabolites. increased dyskinesia was common after  xxxd2000xxx  administration but
was managed by reducing levodopa doses.
 xxxd3395xxx 
adverse events associated with the addition of  xxxd3395xxx  to
levodopa/ddc inhibitor, such as nausea, dyspepsia, vomiting, abdominal pain or cramping and orthostatic hypotension, insomnia, confusion and hallucinations, were also
mainly mild and transient. they did not differ substantially from those occasionally occurring when receiving
levodopa/ddc inhibitor alone [25, 46]. a higher sensitiv-

p32

ity of women to gastrointestinal side effects at high  xxxd3395xxx  doses coadministered with levodopa/ddc inhibitor has been reported [12, 19]. the most frequently reported adverse event was dyskinesia [3, 25]. most of the
side effects were dopaminergic in nature [3, 25]. diarrhoea was the most often reported non-dopaminergic side
effect, occurring in 25–28% of patients on 200 mg t.i.d.
[3, 42] and leading to withdrawal in 8–10% of patients
[3, 42]. it usually appeared during the first 3 months of
treatment and was resolved after stopping  xxxd3395xxx  [3].
raised liver transaminases probably related to  xxxd3395xxx 
have been reported in a few patients [3, 42], appearing
during the first 6 months. the underlying mechanisms of
diarrhoea and raised liver transaminases are unclear. no
abnormalities were reported in vital sign parameters, electrocardiograms or other laboratory tests.

conclusions
comt inhibitors cause a dose-dependent, reversible inhibition of comt activity in erythrocytes,  xxxd3395xxx  inducing a longer-lasting inhibition than  xxxd2000xxx . they significantly decrease 3-omd concentration in plasma, and
correspondingly significantly increase the t ⁄ el and auc of
levodopa in plasma. the  xxxd2000xxx -induced improved
[18f]dopa availability in plasma to the brain for decarboxylation is seen as increased striatal [18f]dopa accumulation both in pd patients and in healthy control subjects.
this forms the background for the therapeutic responses.
clinically, the prolonged levodopa availability is seen
as increased on time and decreased off time both after
the first single dose and after repeated dosing in pd  xxxd2211xxx 

2

tients with end-of-dose fluctuations. the 200-mg dose of
 xxxd2000xxx  is the most effective dose compared with
placebo. for  xxxd3395xxx  doses of 100 mg and 200 mg have
most often proved to be the optimal doses. besides on
time, comt inhibitors also prolong the duration of dyskinesias, or possibly increase their magnitude or frequency. the dyskinesias are controlled by decreasing the
mean daily levodopa dose.
comparative studies between  xxxd2000xxx  and  xxxd3395xxx  are not available. therefore valid conclusions of
their comparison cannot be drawn. however, according to
the results published so far, it seems that the beneficial responses of both compounds during long-term studies are
rather similar. the requirement of total daily levodopa
dose for therapeutic response seems to be decreased on a
similar range with both compounds during long-term
treatment. in respect to adverse effects, there seems to be
a tendency for  xxxd3395xxx  to induce diarrhoea and increases in liver transaminases more often.
in clinical practice,  xxxd2000xxx  and  xxxd3395xxx  differ in
dosing frequency: 200 mg of  xxxd2000xxx  is given along
with each levodopa dose, whereas  xxxd3395xxx  is administered at a dose of 100 or 200 mg three times daily. concomitant dosing of  xxxd2000xxx  with each levodopa dose
may improve patient compliance and make it easier to
control the treatment responses.
comt inhibitors are thus a clinically significant and
beneficial adjunct to levodopa therapy in pd patients with
end-of-dose fluctuations. the effects and significance of
comt inhibitors in the treatment of drug-naive de novo
pd patients need to be clarified. only then will it be possible to consider comt inhibition as a standard treatment for
pd, which always has to be initiated together with levodopa.
