cloning and sequencing of cdna segments of human  xxxg2311xxx  gene encoding the 170 kda form
of human dna topoisomerase
ii show that arg486 of the enzyme has been mutated to a
lysine in the enzyme from two human leukemia cell lines hl-go/amsa
and kbm-s/amsa.
which were independently
selected for resistance
to the antitumor
drug  xxxd168xxx

comparisons
ii and bacterial
gyrase

observed in mamsaresistant human  xxxg2311xxx  corresponds to that of the point mutation
nal-31 in the escherichia
coli gyrase b gene, which confers resistance to nalidixic
acid. because  xxxd168xxx  and nalidixic
acid are known to act on their respective targets by a common mechanism of trapping
the
these results provide
strong evidence
that the

eukaryotic
dna topoisomerase
ii is a ubiquitous
atp-dependent
topoisomerase
that
introduces
enzyme-mediated
gates into double-stranded
dna
which
t’hrough
other
double-stranded
dna
segments clan pass (wang,
1985; vosberg,
1985;
maxwell
$ gellert,
1986). in a manner similar to
that, of phage t4 dna topoisomerase
and bacterial
dna gyrase (bacterial
dna
topoisomerase
ii),
eukaryotic
dna topoisomerase
ii opens and closes
a gate in duplex
dna by two successive transesterification
reactions: in the first, a pair of dna
strands are cleaved and two  xxxd1075xxx 
linkages are formed, anchoring the 5’ phosphoryl
ends of
the severed dna strands to the pair of protomers of
the dimeric enzyme; in the second, the  xxxd1075xxx  links are broken and the continuity
of the dna
strands
is restored.

wyckoff et al., 1989; tsai-pflugfelder
et al., 1989;
chung et al., 1989). between the human and
drosophila
enzyme, for example, over 60% of the
first 1000 amino acid residues are identical. in the
same region, eukaryotic dna  xxxg2312xxx  also
shares sequence similarity
with bacterial dna
gyrase and t4 dna topoisomerase (moriya et al.,
1985; yamagishi et al., 1986; swanberg & wang,
1987; adachi et al., 1987; huang, 1986aj).
recent evidence indicates that eukaryotic dna
 xxxg2312xxx  is the intracellular
target of a
number of clinically relevant antineoplastic agents
of distinct structures, including doxorubicin,  xxxd168xxx  ( xxxd168xxx ), etoposide and  xxxd3309xxx  (ross,
1985; ross et al., 1984; chen et al., 1984; tewey et
al., 1984; waring, 1981; wilson et al., 1981; chow et
al., 1988). all of these drugs apparently stabilize the
covalent enzyme intermediate, and the trapping of
this covalent intermediate is most, likely a critical
step in the pathway leading to drug-induced cell
death (zwelling, 1985; glisson & ross, 1987; liu,
1989).
how these drugs interfere with the enzymemediated
manipulation
of dna strands and
whether drugs of distinct structures interact with
the same domain in the enzyme-dna complex are
not known. by isolating cell lines with altered sensitivity
to a particular
drug but lacking crossresistance to other drugs targeting
the same
enzyme, it should be possible to acquire mutations
in the enzyme that affect specifically interactions
between the drug and the dna-bound enzyme; the
positions of the mutations would in turn provide
information
on how the drug interacts with the
enzyme-dna complex.
hl-60/amsa
is a human myeloid leukemia cell
line selected for  xxxd168xxx  resistance by intermittent
exposure of the cells to  xxxd168xxx . it is uniquely
resistant to  xxxd168xxx , with minimal cross-resistance
to etoposide and anthracycline antibiotics (odaimi
et al., 1986; beran & anderson, 1987). the resistance is not associated with a decrease in the intracellular concentration of  xxxd168xxx , as evidenced by
pharmacokinetic studies using the radiolabeled drug
(odaimi et al., 1986; beran & anderson, 1987).
growth of hl-60/amsa cells in the absence of drug
for 400 doubling times revealed unchanged level of
resistance, suggesting that a stable genetic alteration had occurred (odaimi et al., 1986; beran &
anderson, 1987). hl-go/amsa also differs from its
 xxxd168xxx -sensitive parent by having a large decrease
in the extent
of protein
denaturant-induced
cleavage of intracellular dna in the presence of the
drug, which yields dna fragments with protein
moieties covalently linked to their 5’ end (bakic et
al., 1986; zwelling et al., 1989). when etoposide
instead of  xxxd168xxx  was used, the extents of dna
cleavage in hl&o/amsa
and its parent are not
significantly
different. assays of dna  xxxg2312xxx  activity in nuclear extracts and immunoblotting experiments with antibodies specific to the
170 kda human  xxxg2312xxx  revealed no
significant difference in the enzyme content and the

the drug sensitivity was measured by a cytotoxicity

based on the survival of clonogenic cells growing in semi-sobd
agar medium in the presence of increasing concentrations of the
respective drug. after 6 days of culture, the number of surviving
clonogenic cells was determined by scoring clones of 220 dls.
the drug concentrations
inhibiting 50% of colony formation
(= 50% inhibiting concentration,
ic,,) were determined from
computed cell survival curves as described (odaimi it al.. 1986:

these characteristics of hl-bo/amsa were also
observed in another myeloid leukemia cell line,
erm-3/amsa,
which was independently
selected
for  xxxd168xxx  resistance (table 1) except that hl-60/
amsa was cross-resistant to 5-iminodaunorubicin
(zwelling et al., 1989). taken together, these studies
suggest strongly that the  xxxd168xxx -resistance phenotype of these lines is the consequence of an alteration in dna  xxxg2312xxx  that specifically
affects interaction
between the enzyme and
 xxxd168xxx ,
but not between the enzyme and
etoposide.
to test the possibility that a mutation in the
 xxxg2311xxx  gene of the  xxxd168xxx -resistant
cell lines might
be responsible for the drug-resistance phenotype, we
employed the polymerase chain reaction (pcr) and
dna sequencing to examine the  xxxg2311xxx  cdna fragments from both  xxxd168xxx -resistant
cell lines and
their parent drug-sensitive
counterparts.
after
reverse transcription
of total cellular rna, pcr
was carried out with three sets of oligonucleotide primers: if, 5’-gaccgtcaccatggaagtgtca-3’ (nucleotide positions - 10 to 12t) and

pcr products were about 1.5 kb, 938 bp and 1.1 kb
in size, respectively.
the full-length pcr products obtained from the
pairs of primers 2f-2r and 3f-3r were subcloned
into a plasmid vector pucl8; the 750 bp bamhihind111 fragment of the pcr product from the pair
of primers lf-lr
was similarly subcloned. dna
sequencing was then carried out in at least two
different subclones from each pcr product.
when compared to the published  xxxg2311xxx  cdna
et al., 1989) and the
sequence (tsai-pflugfelder
sequences of the parent drug-sensitive cell lines, we
observed eight nucleotide sequence differences scattered throughout the %9 kb sequenced region in the
two  xxxd168xxx -resistant lines (table 2). the majority
of these changes were not consistent from clone to
clone, except for the changes at nucleotide positions
1435, 1457 and 1555 (equivalent to amino acid
positions 479, 486 and 519, respectively). at nucleotide position 1435, a was replaced by g in both of
the t,wo clones sequenced in kbm-slamsa.
however, this change was not observed in any of
four clones examined in hl-60/amsa.
at nucleotide position 1555, a was switched to t in three out
of five clones sequenced in kbm-slamsa,
suggesting a possibility of heterozygous mutation.
however, this change was not present in the two
clones examined in hl-bo/amsa. strikingly,
the
base change at nucleotide position 1457 was consistently present in four different clones of hl-60/
amsa and in two different clones of kbm-3/amsa
(fig. 1). this change involved replacement of  xxxg1457xxx 
by a, which in turn changed arg486 to lys. there
had been no such switch in both  xxxd168xxx -sensitive
parent counterparts, and thus the possibility of
polymorphism could be excluded.

two oligonucleotide primers, 4f (5’-gcttatcctgactgaggga-3’;
nucleotide positions 1365 to
1383) and 1r as described above, were utilized for
pcr amplification
of genomic dna segments
containing
nucleotide 1457. the expected pcr
product was 133 bp in size, and should be cut either
by ddei in the presence of wild-type alleles or by
msei in the presence of mutant alleles. pcr was
performed with dna samples obtained from
hl-60/amsa,
kbm-3/amsa,
their parent cell
lines, two other unrelated drug-resistant cell lines
(hl-6o/doxorubicin
and cem/vinblastine),
and ten
patients with previously untreated acute myelogenous leukemia (aml). as expected, a dna fragment 133 bp in size was amplified in all of the
samples tested. these products were then digested
with either ddei or msei, and the results are shown
in figure 2. the pcr fragments from the two
 xxxd168xxx -sensitive parent lines, hl-60/doxorubicin,
cem/vinblastine
and ten pretreatment
aml
samples were completely digestible with ddei, but
not with msei. in contrast, the pcr fragments of
hl-go/amsa and kbm-s/amsa
were completely
digested by msei, but not by ddei. these results
demonstrate clearly that the mutation is homozygous at th e genomic level in both mamsaresistant cell lines, and confirm the dna sequencing
results that originally identified the base change at
the rna level.

of a lysine residue at this position in bacterial
gyrase. furthermore,
because bacterial gyrase is
known to be insensitive to  xxxd168xxx  (liu, 1989), it is
not unreasonable that a conservative change of
arg486 to lys in the human enzyme can lead to
resistance to the drug. interestingly, an e. coei nalidixic acid-resistant mutant ml-31 is known to be
due to a mutation of lysine at this position (lys447
of the b subunit) to  xxxd2431xxx  (yamagishi et al.,
1986). this correspondence is likely to be significant
in view of the structural and evolutionary relatedness between eukaryotic dna  xxxg2312xxx  and
bacterial gyrase. sequence comparison between
human and yeast dna  xxxg2312xxx  indicates
that tyr804 is the active site tyrosine that becomes
covalently linked to dna in the enzyme-mediated
transient breakage of dna (tsai-pflugfelder et al.,
1989). because both  xxxd168xxx  and nalidixic acid
appear to interfere
with
the second transesterification reaction catalyzed by their respective
target enzymes, the location of a nalidixic acid
resistance mutation as well as an  xxxd168xxx  mutation
to the -pro-leu-(arg/lys)-gly-lys-(leu/ile/met)leu-asn- motif suggests that both this motif and
the active site tyrosine might be proximal to the
dna scissile bonds.
the sequence -pro-leu-arg-gly-lys-ile-leu-asnis present in the 170 kda human dna  xxxg2312xxx  as well as its 180 kda isozyme (tsaipflugfelder
et al., 1989; chung et al., 1989).
however, the sequences of our pcr primers were
less than 80% identical with their counterparts in
the 180 kda form of human dna  xxxg2312xxx ,
except for primers 1r and 2f. therefore, whether a
mutation may have occurred in the 180 kda form of
the human  xxxg2312xxx  was not examined in
our study. nevertheless, the results presented here
provide strong evidence that the 170 kda form of
human  xxxg2312xxx  encoded by the  xxxg2311xxx  gene
on chromosome 17q21-22 is a cellular target of
 xxxd168xxx . since the simultaneous presence of an
 xxxd168xxx -sensitive
180 kda form and that of an
 xxxd168xxx -resistant
170 kda form in a cell are
expected to give an  xxxd168xxx -sensitive
phenotype
(liu, 1989; drake et al., 1987), the 180 kda form is
either present at a low level in the  xxxd168xxx -resistant
lines hl-6o/amsa
and kbm3/amsa,
or has
mutated to a drug-resistant form as well.
resistance to other drugs targeting dna  xxxg2312xxx , such as doxorubicin or etoposide, has
frequently been observed. the identification
of a
common mutation
in the top.2 gene in two
independently
isolated  xxxd168xxx -resistant
human
cell lines suggests that resistance to other topoisomerase-targeting
drugs may also arise due to
mutations in the  xxxg2311xxx  gene. the present results,
with
previous
results showing that
together
mutations in the eukaryotic  xxxg2310xxx  gene encoding
 xxxg2310xxx  can lead to resistance to the
eukaryotic
 xxxg2310xxx -targeting
drug
 xxxd412xxx  (tamura et al., 1991), provide strong
evidence that mutations in dna topoisomerase
structural genes are one mode of drug resistance in

cancer chemotherapy. with the use of the described
approach, it is likely that detailed studies in cells
selected for resistance to different topoisomerasetargeting drugs will lead to the discovery of other
mutations and ultimately
to the mapping
and
molecular
characterization
of
drug-specific
alterations.
