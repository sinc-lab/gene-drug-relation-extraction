background/aims: to determine the use and safety profile of
non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (nsaids) among turkish osteoarthritis patients. methods: osteoarthritis patients
were interviewed by 138 doctors from clinics in nine different cities. doctors completed a questionnaire regarding non-steroidal
anti-inflammatory drugs use and safety profile while interviewing the patients. results: totally 3,755 patients (female/male: 3/1, mean age 59.0 ± 12.2 years), 3,442 under non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs treatment, were included in the
study. the use of  xxxd2561xxx  (5.5% vs. 14.4%) and specific  xxxg1884xxx  (cox-2) inhibitors (for celecoxib 3.3% vs. 12.2%;
for rofecoxib 3.0% vs. 11.2%) increased more than that of other
non-selective non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. the most
common side effects were epigastric burning (37%), other
dyspeptic symptoms (25.3%), abdominal pain (17.0%), constipation (12.7%), nausea (10.6%) and diarrhea (3.0%). cox-2 selective and specific inhibitors had significantly lower incidence of
dyspeptic complaints compared to non-selective non-steroidal
anti-inflammatory drugs. no difference was found between the
different non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs regarding the
ratio of discontinuation of therapy due to inefficacy. the ratios
of discontinuation due to side effects were lower in patients
using cox-2 specific inhibitors compared to non-selective and
selective non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs: celecoxib
(7.7%), rofecoxib (10.3%),  xxxd2065xxx  (12.4%),  xxxd2561xxx  (12.6%),
 xxxd3311xxx  (16.5%), diclofenac (16.8%), ibuprofen (19.4%), and
naproxen (27.4%). discontinuation of the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs due to dyspeptic complaint was significantly
less for specific cox-2 inhibitors than for non-selective and selective non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs: celecoxib (2.5%),
rofecoxib (8.4%),  xxxd2561xxx  (9.5%),  xxxd2065xxx  (13.4%),  xxxd3311xxx 
(14.0%), diclofenac (14.1%), ibuprofen (17.2%), and naproxen
(24.4%). conclusions: the use of  xxxd2561xxx  and specific cox2 inhibitors seems to have increased more than that of other
non-selective non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, if previously used non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are considered. fewer dyspeptic complaints have been reported with
specific cox-2 inhibitors.

nsaids in osteoarthritis

this hospital-based epidemiological surveillance
study was designed to determine the use and safety profile of nsaids among a large population of
turkish patients with osteoarthritis.
materials and methods
this study was designed as an epidemiological
surveillance study. between may 2002 and january 2003, a total of 250 doctors (primary care
physicians, physical therapy and rehabilitation
specialists, orthopedic surgeons, internists and
rheumatologists) from nine different cities in turkey were invited to the study, and 138 of them interviewed the osteoarthritis patients who were under nsaids treatment and had provided informed
consent. participating doctors were located in cities scattered widely enough geographically as to be
representative of the whole country. the specialty
distribution of the doctors showed a similar profile; therefore, the study was considered to include a
representative sample of osteoarthritis patients.
a questionnaire regarding previous and current
nsaids usage, reasons for discontinuation of
nsaids and the side effects of nsaids was completed for each patient during the interview in one
visit. the questionnaire is given in figure 1.

nsaids are among the most widely prescribed
and used classes of drugs worldwide. despite their clinical benefits in the management of osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis, nsaids have
considerable side effects, mostly affecting the upper gastrointestinal system, which limit their use
(4, 5). selective and specific  xxxg1884xxx 
(cox-2) inhibitors, which have a better gastrointestinal risk profile, have been shown to be comparably effective, safer and cost-effective alternatives to conventional nsaids, which are mostly
non-selective cyclooxygenase inhibitors (6, 7).

current guidelines for the treatment of osteoarthritis recommend pharmacological therapy, including acetaminophen for mild-to-moderate pain
and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (nsaids) for moderate-to-severe osteoarthritis symptoms, if non-pharmacological interventions fail (3).

the most common chronic joint disease throughout the world is osteoarthritis, which is associated
with degeneration of the joints. the prevalence of
osteoarthritis of the knee is between 0.1%-44%
and is dependent on increasing age and female
gender (1, 2).

statistical method
the data were expressed using descriptive statistics such as number and percentage of patients.
the frequencies and ratios were compared using chi2
test. the statistically significant level of p was regarded as 0.05. the total number of patients in the
different tables may differ because of some missing information in the questionnaires.
results
nsaids usage
a total of 3, 755 patients (female/male: 3/1, mean
age 59.0 ± 12.2 years), 3, 442 of whom were under
nsaids treatment, were included in the study.
most of the patients (87.2%) were using only one
nsaid, while others were using two or three
nsaids (table 1). forty-nine percent of the patients had used nsaids previously.

dyspeptic complaints
epigastric burning, other dyspeptic complaints
(bloating, postprandial fullness, abdominal fullness, indigestion), abdominal pain, constipation
and nausea were the five most commonly seen
dyspeptic complaints of nsaids in the studied patient population (table 4). the patients using
cox-2 specific inhibitors (celecoxib and rofecoxib)
were found to have a significantly lower incidence
of dyspeptic complaints compared to non-selective
nsaids (p<0.001) (table 5).
discussion
this hospital-based non-interventional epidemiological study is the first to be performed on a large number of patients representing a population of
turkish patients with osteoarthritis under nsaids therapy.
as expected from previous epidemiological studies
on rheumatological diseases, most of the patients
included in the study were female and over 50 years of age (8).
in this study, diclofenac was found to be the most
commonly used nsaids among turkish patients.
regarding the nsaids usage, the most remarkable finding of the study was the increased preference of patients and doctors towards  xxxd2561xxx  and
specific cox-2 inhibitors (celecoxib and rofecoxib).
this preference is similar to that observed in the
other countries in which selective and specific
cox-2 inhibitors have been introduced into the
market (9, 10).
it has been demonstrated in many previous large
scale studies that selective ( xxxd2561xxx ,  xxxd2727xxx  and  xxxd2065xxx ) and specific (celecoxib and rofecoxib) cox-2 inhibitors have an efficacy that is comparable to non-selective, conventional nsaids
(i.e. naproxen, ibuprofen, diclofenac), but with a
significantly lower incidence of gastrointestinal
complications (11-16).

in this study, patients under nsaids therapy reported mostly dyspeptic complaints, and the incidence of dyspeptic complaints in patients using
non-selective conventional nsaids was significantly higher than that in patients under selective or specific cox-2 inhibitor therapy. also, the
percentage of discontinuation of previous nsaids
due to side effects was higher in the conventional
nsaids therapy group. regarding the discontinuation of therapy for dyspeptic complaints, specific
cox-2 inhibitors seem superior to both conventional and selective cox-2 inhibitors. this indicates that specific cox-2 inhibitors (celecoxib and
rofecoxib) have a better dyspeptic complaint profile than both conventional and selective cox-2 inhibitors. on the other hand, no difference was found in the percentage of discontinuation of therapy due to inefficacy between patients using nonselective, selective or specific cox-2 inhibitors.
this study is important due to its naturalistic,
hospital-based epidemiological design in a large
osteoarthritis population in turkey. the findings
of the study are consistent with the previous studies and add further daily practice data to the outcome of large clinical trials.
in conclusion, the use of  xxxd2561xxx  and specific
cox-2 inhibitors seems to have increased more
than that of other non-selective nsaids, when
previously used nsaids are considered. fewer
overall side effects have been reported with selective and specific cox-2 inhibitors. furthermore,
the percentage of patients who discontinued the
nsaids due to dyspeptic complaints was significantly less in the specific cox-2 inhibitor therapy
patient group.
