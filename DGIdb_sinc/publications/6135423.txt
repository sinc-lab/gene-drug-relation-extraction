abstract- xxxd3255xxx 
is a potent antiinflammatory drug used in the treatment of ulcerative colitis.
the mechanism of action of  xxxd3255xxx  is unknown but a recent study [w. f. stenson and e. lobos,
j. clin. inuest. 69, 494 (1982)] demonstrated that  xxxd3255xxx , at therapeutic concentrations, blocks
human neutrophil lipoxygenase, suggesting that its antiinflammatory effects may be mediated in part
by the inhibition of the synthesis of the chemotactic lipids 5-hydroxy-6,8,11,14-eicosatetraenoic
acid
(5-hete) and leukotriene bd (ltb4). in the present study the effect of  xxxd3255xxx  on metabolism
of exogenous  xxxd208xxx  by human platelets was investigated.  xxxd3255xxx  inhibited platelet
thromboxane synthetase (~0 = 0.9 mm) and partially inhibited cyclooxygenase. a methylated analog
of  xxxd3255xxx  also inhibited thromboxane synthetase (ic50= 0.3 mm) and partially inhibited cyclooxygenase. neither of the cleavage products of  xxxd3255xxx  ( xxxd2579xxx  and sulfapyridine)
inhibited thromboxane synthetase although  xxxd2579xxx  blocked cyclooxygenase (1~50= 5 mm).
neither  xxxd3255xxx  nor the methylated analog nor the cleavage products inhibited platelet lipoxygenase.
this is in contrast to the inhibitory effects of  xxxd3255xxx  on neutrophil  xxxg147xxx . the concentration of  xxxd3255xxx  in the colons of treated patients is several-fold ireat& than the lcso for
thromboxane synthetase.

acid cyclooxygenase and n - 8 lipoxygenase
are the initial enzymatic steps in the two pathways
of  xxxd208xxx  metabolism in the human platelet. the sole known product of the lipoxygenase
pathway in platelets is 12-hydroperoxy-5,8,10,14eicosatetraenoic acid (1zhpete) which is reduced
to 12-hydroxy-5,8,10,14-eicosatetraenoic
acid (12hete). the major products of the cyclooxygenase
pathway in platelets are thromboxane bz (txb2) and
12-hydroxy-5,8,10-heptadecatrienoic
acid (hht).
prostaglandin ez (pge2) and pgf2,are also formed
but in much smaller amounts. the production of
hht and txbz can be selectively blocked by inhibition of thromboxane synthetase [ 1,2]. aspirin and
other non-steroidal
antiinflammatory
drugs have
been found to inhibit cyclooxygenase [3] and under
certain circumstances the lipoxygenase pathway [4].
 xxxd3255xxx  is an antiinflammatory agent used in
the treatment of ulcerative colitis. bacteria in the
colon split  xxxd3255xxx  into  xxxd2579xxx  and
sulfapyridine. most of the sulfapyridine is absorbed
but both  xxxd3255xxx  and  xxxd2579xxx 
are
poorly absorbed. in patients treated with  xxxd3255xxx , the concentrations of  xxxd3255xxx  and  xxxd2579xxx  in the stool are 2 and lomm, respectively [5], while the blood concentrations are much
lower; the peak serum concentration of  xxxd3255xxx 
after a 2 g oral dose has been reported to be 50 pm
[6] while the serum concentration of  xxxd2579xxx  is below the limits of detection.
the mechanism of action of  xxxd3255xxx  is known.

several studies have suggested that its therapeutic
activity is related to its effects on arachidonic
acid
metabolism.
increased levels of prostaglandins and

prostaglandin metabolites have been found in the
stool, serum and urine of patients with inflammatory
bowel disease [7]. treatment with  xxxd3255xxx 
results in a decrease in the levels of these products.
similarly increased amounts of pge2, prostacyclin
and txb2 are secreted by colonic mucosal explants
from patients with inflammatory bowel disease [8].
incubation of these explants in vitro with  xxxd3255xxx  and other antiinflammatory
drugs diminishes the synthesis of  xxxd208xxx 
metabolites.
other studies have revealed that  xxxd3255xxx 
inhibits the enzymes that metabolize prostaglandins
[9]. this effect would increase rather than decrease
prostaglandin levels.
we recently reported that  xxxd3255xxx , at concentrations found in the colons of treated individuals,
inhibits neutrophil  xxxg147xxx  in vitro and thus
diminishes the synthesis of 5-hydroxy-6,8,11,14eicosatetraenoic acid (5-hete) and leukotriene bj
(ltbi) [lo]. 5-hete and ltb4 are potent chemotactic compounds thought to be important in the
amplification and modulation of the inflammatory
response.
in the present study, we have examined the effects
of  xxxd3255xxx  in the metabolism of arachidonic
acid in platelets. we chose to study  xxxd208xxx 
metabolism in platelets for several reasons: (1) to
determine whether the inhibitory effects of  xxxd3255xxx  on neutrophil  xxxg147xxx  extend to
platelet n - 8 lipoxygenase, (2) to determine the
effects of  xxxd3255xxx  on thromboxane synthetase
in view of the report of increased levels of txbz
production by mucosal explants from inflammatory

bowel disease, and (3) to define the effects of  xxxd3255xxx  and 5aminosalicylate
on cyclooxygenase.
although
both of these compounds
have been
reported to inhibit prostaglandin
synthesis, they have
never before been studied in a well-defined
population of homogeneous
cells where their effects on
cyclooxygenase
could be separated from effects on
other
enzymes
involved
in arachidonic
acid
metabolism.
in this study we have demonstrated
that  xxxd3255xxx  and methylsulfasalazine
(2-hydroxy-5-[[4(3-methyl-2-pyridinyl
amino) sulfonyl phenyl]azo]benzoic
acid) inhibited
thromboxane
synthetase
and partially inhibited
cyclooxygenase.
 xxxd2579xxx  inhibited cyclooxygenase
but not thromboxane synthetase.
neither  xxxd3255xxx  nor  xxxd2579xxx  inhibited platelet n - 8 lipoxygenase.

methylsulfasalazine,
 xxxd2579xxx 
and sulfapyridine on the metabolism
of exogenous
arachidonic
acid in platelets.  xxxd3255xxx  inhibited the synthesis
of thromboxane
b2 with an 1~50of 0.9 mm. as the
production
of thromboxane
bz and hht progressively declined, the production
of pgez and pgfza
increased.
this pattern is consistent with inhibition
of thromboxane
synthetase
and the diversion
of
pgh2 into the synthesis of pge2 and  xxxg1734xxx , [2].
there was also an increase in the synthesis of 12hete, consistent with diversion of  xxxd208xxx 
away from cyclooxygenase
and into lipoxygenase.
methylsulfasalazine
had the same effects as  xxxd3255xxx  but with a lower 1~50 (0.3 mm) for thromboxane bz synthesis.
5aminosalicylate

discusslon

the major goal of this study was to define better
the effects of sulfasaiazine on  xxxd208xxx 
metabolism. platelets were chosen because their
pathways of  xxxd208xxx 
metabolism
are well
defined and it is possible to use them to delineate
the effects of  xxxd3255xxx  and its metabolites on
specific enzymes. in this study we demonstrated that
 xxxd3255xxx  and a methyl analog inhibited platelet
thromboxane
synthetase.
 xxxd3255xxx 
and its
methyl analog also inhibited cyclooxygenase, but
only weakly. 5aminosalicylate,
one cleavage product of  xxxd3255xxx , blocked cyclooxygenase but not
thromboxane synthetase. sulfapyridine, the other
cleavage product, and no effect on  xxxd208xxx 
metabolism.
none of the drugs tested bfocked
platelet n - 8 lipoxygenase although  xxxd3255xxx 
blocks neutrophil lipoxygenase [lo].
it was not the purpose of this study to determine
which of the pharmacologic effects of  xxxd3255xxx 
and 5aminosalicylate
account for their therapeutic
efficacies in inflammatory bowel disease, nor was
the study designed to determine whether the major
therapeutic agent is  xxxd3255xxx  or  xxxd2579xxx  [14]. however, this study may give some insight
into both of these questions. this is the first demon-

stration of  xxxd3255xxx  inhibiting thromboxane synthetase. an earlier study demonstrated increased
levels of thromboxane i32 secreted by explants of
colonic mucosa from patients with inflammatory
bowel disease [8]. however, the cell of origin of the
thromboxane measured in that study is unknown.
thromboxane az has proinflammatory
properties,
including the induction of platelet aggregation, it is
possible that inhibition of thromboxane synthesis
could contribute to the diminution of the intlammatory response in inflammatory bowel disease. the
concentration of  xxxd3255xxx  in the colons of treated
patients is about 2mm is], which is considerabiy
more than the dose required to inhibit thromboxane
synthesis. however, the serum concentration of  xxxd3255xxx  is fess than the iq for thromboxane synthesis so one would not expect a prolongation of the
bleeding time. how much of the antiinflammatory
effects of  xxxd3255xxx  in ulcerative colitis can be
related to inhibition of thromboxane synthesis is
unknown.
this study contains the clearest evidence to date
of inhibition of cyclooxygenase by s-aminosalicylate.
the concentration of  xxxd2579xxx  in the colon
that is greater than the ic~ofor inhibition of cyclooxygenase [15]. this finding is consistent with the
suggestion that the therapeutic effect of  xxxd2579xxx  is secondary to the inhibition of cyclooxygenase. this study also shows that the parent
molecule,  xxxd3255xxx , is a relatively poor inhibitor
of cyclooxygenase, compared to  xxxd2579xxx .
in addition, the dose of  xxxd3255xxx  required for
even partial inhibition of cyclooxygenase is a good
deal higher than that required for inhibition of
platelet thromboxane
synthetase
or neutrophil
lipoxygenase.
this study does not help determine if the therapeutic effects of  xxxd3255xxx  are induced by the
entire molecule or by the cleavage product,  xxxd2579xxx . however, it reaffirms that suifasalazine has pharmacologic properties not shared by
either of its cleavage products, in this case the inhibition of thromboxane synthetase.
