abstract: the  xxxg87xxx  adrenoceptors are three of nine well-characterized receptors that are activated by epinephrine and
norepinephrine. agonists acting at the  xxxg87xxx  adrenoceptors produce numerous physiological effects, and are used
therapeutically for several indications. many known  xxxg87xxx  adrenoceptor agonists are alpha1a selective, but the discovery of
highly selective alpha1b and alpha1d adrenoceptor agonists has proven to be an extremely difficult goal to achieve. this review
will focus on recent advances in the discovery, development and clinical utility of subtype-specific  xxxg87xxx  agonists as well as
contributions to our understanding of agonist-receptor interactions.

introduction

oh

norepinephine (noradrenaline, 1) is a major neurotransmitter of the peripheral sympathetic nervous system, and
epinephrine (adrenaline, 2) is the key circulating hormone
produced by the adrenal medulla. these two important
chemical messengers mediate their effects in the body via
adrenoceptors, or adrenergic receptors, which are heptahelical (7tm) g-protein coupled receptors. adrenergic
receptors and their ligands have long been an area of active
research, as the ability of the extracts of the adrenal gland to
elicit certain physiological responses in living organisms
(such as blood pressure increases) was demonstrated over a
century ago [1]. the existence of more than one adrenergic
receptor, alpha and beta, was postulated in 1948 by ahlquist to
explain different physiological responses in different tissues
(muscle relaxation versus muscle contraction) [2]. in the
early 1970s, langer suggested a further sub-classification of
the alpha receptors into  xxxg87xxx  and  xxxg831xxx  based on location (postsynaptic and presynaptic, respectively) [3]. over the last two
decades, advances in molecular biology have enabled the
thorough characterization of nine adrenoceptors, which have
been cloned, expressed, and sequenced. these nine receptors
are divided into three sub-families (based on structural
similarity, localization and pharmacology): the  xxxg87xxx  receptors
(alpha1a, alpha1b, and alpha1d), the  xxxg831xxx  receptors (alpha2a, alpha2b, and alpha2c) and
the beta receptors ( xxxg836xxx ,  xxxg837xxx   xxxg1553xxx   xxxg2356xxx , and  xxxg838xxx ). the history of adrenoceptors,
including their discovery, identification and classification
has been extensively reviewed [4-8]. norepinephrine and
epinephrine (fig. (1)) regulate a wide range of diverse
physiological functions by virtue of interacting with the
various receptor types in different tissues. while numerous
drugs have been commercialized that act on adrenergic
receptors to produce desirable effects in areas including the
cardiovascular, pulmonary, and central nervous systems, the
development in understanding receptor subtypes has allowed
the intentional design of adrenergic agents that attempt to
utilize subtype selective action to obtain desired pharmacology while minimizing unwanted effects. this review will
concentrate on recent efforts in the field of  xxxg87xxx

adrenoceptor agonists, with an emphasis on the medicinal
chemistry around subtype selectivity.
historical  xxxg87xxx  agonists
adrenergic receptor agonists have been used to treat a
variety of conditions. the endogenous ligands, which are
active at  xxxg87xxx ,  xxxg831xxx , and beta receptors, have clinical applications.
norepinephrine (1) has been employed to treat hypotension
associated with sudden blood loss, anesthesia or trauma, and
as adjunct therapy in cardiac arrest. epinephrine (2) has
several clinical uses, including as adjunct therapy for
anesthesia, treatment of asthma, nasal decongestion, and as
first line therapy for treatment of anaphylaxis [9]. the
vasoconstrictive effects of these agents are primarily alpha
receptor mediated. use of these agents must be carefully
monitored, as the potent broad effects on adrenergic
receptors which give the needed vasoconstriction can also
lead to severe hypertension or cerebrovascular hemorrhage.
even prior to full delineation of adrenergic receptor
subtypes, many other adrenergic receptor agonists had been
successfully developed and marketed. agents with  xxxg87xxx 
adrenoceptor activity include the anti-hypotensive agents
phenylephrine (3),  xxxd2601xxx  (4),  xxxd2584xxx  (5) and
midodrine (6) (which is a pro-drug, as in vivo cleavage of the
 xxxd149xxx  provides the active phenethylamine) (fig.
(2)).
these drugs are effective due to their ability to increase
blood pressure through peripheral vasoconstriction, an  xxxg87xxx 
adrenoceptor mediated effect. local vasoconstriction in nasal
or eye tissue can relieve congestion, and drugs with  xxxg87xxx 
adrenoceptor agonist activity are commonly used for these
purposes, including phenylephrine (3),  xxxd3539xxx  (7),

bond (such as a hydroxyl or sulfonamide) is generally
needed for potent and efficacious compounds in the
phenethylamine series. imidazolines, such as  xxxd2698xxx ,
can be very simple structures with little functionality. the
sar is not identical for phenethylamine and imidazoline  xxxg87xxx 
adrenoceptor agonists, and demonstration of a lack of crossdesensitization between agonists from these two classes
strengthened the hypothesis that they do not bind or activate
 xxxg87xxx  adrenoceptors through the exact same ligand-receptor
interactions [14].

oxymetazoline (8),  xxxd2698xxx  (9) and  xxxd3336xxx  (10)
(fig. (3)). topical application of  xxxg87xxx  adrenoceptor agonists to
the eye leads to mydriasis (sustained dilation of the pupil),
and  xxxd2698xxx  (9) is often used in eye exams for this
purpose.
the general structure-activity relationships for early  xxxg87xxx 
adrenoceptor ligands have been extensively described, and
reviews highlight excellent historical work in the field of
medicinal chemistry [10-12]. structure-activity relationships
developed using isolated tissue preparations and in vivo
studies (prior to knowledge of the sequence or structure of
the receptors) provided remarkable insight into ligandreceptor interactions. briefly,  xxxg87xxx  agonists fall into two broad
structural classes, phenethylamines and imidazolines. the
phenethylamines, structural analogues of norepinephrine and
epinephrine, usually require the hydroxyl group on the
phenethylamine alkyl chain for agonist activity. the eassonstedman hypothesis proposed in the 1930’s suggests a threepoint binding orientation for these ligands, requiring a
specific stereoisomer. in fact, the r-enantiomer of norepinephrine and other  xxxg87xxx  agonists in the phenethylamine class
are much more active than the s-enantiomer or the
deshydroxy compounds. the hydroxyl is not an absolute
requirement for activation, especially in constrained
analogues, such as aminotetralins like sdz nvi 085 (11)
(see fig. (4))[13]. imidazoline and imidazole  xxxg87xxx  agonists do
not benefit from a benzylic hydroxyl group. for  xxxg87xxx  adrenoceptors, agonists do not require both catecholic hydroxyl
groups to potently activate the receptor, but retention of at
least one aromatic ring substituent that can form a hydrogen

still, most, if not all, well-characterized  xxxg87xxx  adrenoceptor
agonists share a simple core structure. a basic amine, 3-4
bonds away from a phenyl ring (or isostere) is required.
unlike some beta adrenoceptor agonists, potent  xxxg87xxx  adrenoceptor
agonists do not possess large substituents on the basic
nitrogen. small alkyl groups, or the completion of a small
ring, are usually all that is tolerated in that region of the
molecule for retention of agonist activity. an unusual
exception may be the  xxxg1108xxx   xxxg1110xxx   xxxg1113xxx   xxxg1114xxx   xxxg1115xxx   xxxg1117xxx   xxxg1119xxx  ligand buspirone
(12) (fig. (4)), a larger molecule that is generally regarded as
a functional antagonist at  xxxg87xxx  adrenoceptors, but has been
characterized as a partial agonist at the alpha1d adrenoceptor
subtype in isolated tissue experiments [15,16].
the compact, simple  xxxg87xxx  adrenoceptor agonist pharmacophore provides an exciting starting point for the search for
subtype selective agonists, as adding substituents or
constraints that might preferentially favor ligand-receptor
interactions at only one subtype could still yield relatively
small molecules with favorable drug-like properties.

recent advances in the discovery of  xxxg87xxx -adrenoceptor agonists

 xxxg87xxx  receptor subtypes
the advances in molecular biology in the 1980’s and
1990’s led to the cloning, expression, and sequencing of
numerous proteins. for many 7tm gpcr families, this led
to a clearer understanding of the different receptor subtypes
that are activated by the same endogenous ligands. nine
adrenoceptors were identified with different amino acid
sequences, including three distinct  xxxg87xxx  adrenoceptors,
eventually designated alpha1a, alpha1b, and alpha1d (when referring to the
recombinant receptor, the lower case letter is used to
designate the subtype, while upper case letters are used for
the pharmacologically defined subtypes, alpha1a, alpha1b, and alpha1d,
respectively) [17].
a putative fourth  xxxg87xxx  receptor subtype, referred to as the
alpha1l subtype, has been pharmacologically defined in several
tissues [18]. no unique sequence for alpha1l has been reported,
and it has been postulated (and supported experimentally)
that alpha1l may be an affinity state of the alpha1a subtype [19].
several  xxxg87xxx  agonist patent applications refer to the claimed
small molecules as alpha1l agonists, and for the purposes of this
review those will be discussed with the alpha1a agonists.
the three cloned  xxxg87xxx  adrenoceptors share 50-51% amino
acid identity between the individual receptor proteins [8]. in
peripheral tissues their primary signaling pathway is through
gq/11 to release intracellular calcium and activate the inositol
phosphate pathway, although other signaling pathways are
also utilized by these receptors [20].
all three subtypes are widely distributed within the body,
with significant expression in the cardiovascular system,
other smooth muscle, and the cns. however, the subtypes
do show different distribution patterns. several reviews
provide detailed information on tissue localization of the
three  xxxg87xxx -adrenoceptor subtypes [4,21,22]. all three subtypes
are found in the brain, but with variation in subtype
expression between brain regions. while all three subtypes
are found in the vasculature, different vascular tissues can
have one subtype dominate the alpha 1 -adrenergic effects in that
tissue, for instance alpha1a dominates in the rat caudal artery,
alpha1b in the rabbit aorta, and alpha1d in the rat aorta. differential
expression of  xxxg87xxx  subtypes in various tissues is well
documented, and therefore the development of subtype
specific ligands may result in more effective therapeutic
agents with fewer side effects [23].
an exciting advance in the last few years has been the
generation of knockout mice lacking one or multiple  xxxg87xxx 
subtypes. the physiological roles of the individual subtypes
have been difficult to define in many tissues and systems,
and the transgenic mice may facilitate this effort. for
instance, the knockout phenotypes indicate that all three
subtypes are involved in blood pressure control and likely in
cardiovascular tissue growth and differentiation as well
[24,25]. on-going work with knockout animals (and isolated
tissues from these animals) with subtype-selective ligands
should further clarify the functional roles of the individual
subtypes.
the ability of  xxxg87xxx  adrenoceptors to form homodimers as
well as heterodimers with other g-protein coupled receptors
(including other  xxxg87xxx  subtypes) has recently been documented,
and the functional role of these dimers is poorly understood

current topics in medicinal chemistry, 2007, vol. 7, no. 2 137

[26,27]. as the subtype-specificity of ligands is often defined
using in vitro systems that overexpress one subtype, it is
possible that different functional activity of ligands on
heterodimers in natural tissues may complicate our interpretation of adrenergic receptor subtype pharmacology in
vivo.
 xxxg87xxx  subtype-selective agonists
historically, the ability of different compounds to initiate
contractions in diverse blood vessels gave some indication
that individual agonists could display varying potency and
efficacy at different receptor subtypes. different tissues have
been utilized for in vitro selectivity determination: rat vas
deferens, rat submaxillary gland and rat kidney for the alpha1a,
rat spleen and rat liver for alpha1b, and rat aorta for the alpha1d
subtype [4]. however, a definite correlation between different tissues and a single subtype was lacking. availability of
the cloned receptor subtypes allowed for in vitro evaluation
of the subtype activity and selectivity of  xxxg87xxx  adrenoceptor
ligands. in 1994, minneman and coworkers evaluated a
number of known agonists using cloned animal receptors
(hamster alpha1a, bovine alpha1b, and rat alpha1d) expressed in hek 293
cells, and demonstrated that norepinephrine and epinephrine
had similar potencies and intrinsic efficacies at all three
subtypes [28]. interestingly, they also found that all six of
the imidazoline compounds tested (oxymetazoline (8),
clonidine (13),  xxxd1707xxx  (14),  xxxd3539xxx  (7), sgd
101/75 (15), and st 587 (16), see fig. (5)) selectively
activated the alpha1a subtype, with little intrinsic activity at the
other two subtypes. amidephrine (17) also activated only the
alpha1a subtype, and skf89748 ( 18) showed good selectivity for
the alpha1a subtype, while still displaying some activity at the
other two subtypes (fig. (6)). a patent application from
synaptic pharmaceuticals containing data using the cloned
human  xxxg87xxx  adrenoceptors also highlighted this phenomenon
[29]. data in this patent application showed that sdz nvi
085 (11), sk&f 102652 (19), st-1059 (20), and a-61603
(21) selectively activated the alpha1a subtype (fig. (7)). these
early reports on in vitro characterization of  xxxg87xxx  agonists
demonstrated that alpha1a subtype-selective agonists are relatively easy to identify, while agonists with good selectivity for
alpha1b and alpha1d subtypes may be less common.
alpha1a selective agonists
the possibility that subtype-specific ligands may
separate some of the cardiovascular effects from the
urogenital effects of  xxxg87xxx  agonists, thus improving their utility
for the treatment of stress urinary incontinence, has driven
most of the exploration for selective alpha1a agonists. stress
urinary incontinence is characterized by the involuntary loss
of urine due to a sudden increase in intra-abdominal pressure
(for example, pressure from sneezing, laughing, coughing, or
strenuous exercise) [30]. the cause can be weakened or
damaged bladder neck and urethral muscle tissue. activation
of  xxxg87xxx  adrenoceptors in the bladder neck and urethral smooth
muscle causes muscle contraction, leading to increased
bladder outlet resistance, which can offset increases in intraabdominal pressure. while  xxxg87xxx  agonists are sometimes
prescribed (off-label in the u.s.) for stress urinary
incontinence, typical alpha adrenergic side effects (cardiovascular and cns) limit doses, and therefore limit clinical

efficacy [31-33]. literature evidence suggests that the alpha1a
adrenoceptor (or the putative alpha1l form of alpha1a) may be the
predominant subtype in urethral tissue [34-36]. based on this
hypothesis, pharmaceutical companies have sought to
identify novel, potent, highly selective alpha1a or alpha1l agonists
(vs. alpha1b and alpha1d) for treatment of stress urinary incontinence,
hoping for an improved side effect profile. several
companies have patented or reported on selective alpha1a
agonists, and in some cases have shared evidence of
improved uroselectivity (increase in urethral pressure versus
increase in blood pressure) over common  xxxg87xxx  agonists that
have been used clinically for urinary incontinence, including
midodrine, phenylephrine and phenylpropanolamine.
ns-49 (22), a selective alpha1a agonist discovered by nippon
shinyaku, exhibited good uroselectivity vs. blood pressure in
animal models [37]. in a calcium mobilization assay using
the cloned human  xxxg87xxx  receptors expressed in cho cells, ns49 was reported to be a partial agonist of the alpha1a subtype,

with roughly 10-fold selectivity over the other two subtypes,
but with low intrinsic activity at alpha1b and alpha1d (alpha1a pec50=6.44
(67% of norepinephrine response); alpha1b pec50=5.49 (19% );
alpha1d pec50=5.37 (31% )) [38,39]. ns-49 is a phenethylamine,
structurally similar to phenylephrine. ns-49 possesses a
methylsulfonamide at the 3-position of the aromatic ring,
which is a common feature of several alpha1a agonists.
catecholamines like norepinephrine have a phenol at this
position, and the sulfonamide of ns-49 is an isosteric
replacement for this phenol and may make an important
hydrogen bond with the receptor. ns-49 completed a phase
ii clinical trial for the treatment of urinary incontinence, but
was discontinued, reportedly due to disappointing efficacy
results.
boehringer ingelheim filed a patent application on the
enantiomers of a known related racemic molecule (the direct
sulfonamido isostere of norepinephrine), 23, claiming
surprisingly outstanding alpha1l agonism with high selectivity

for bladder tissue, but with no receptor activity or selectivity
data supplied [40].

the n-h proton of the sulfonamide, but shows little change
in activity versus the non-methylated analogue. compound
27 is still capable of participating in a hydrogen bond with
the serine as a hydrogen bond acceptor, via the oxygens of
the sulfonamide, but it does lack the acidic proton that can
mimic the phenol as a hydrogen bond donor. it is also
possible that hydrogen bonding interactions from the
sulfonamide substituent are not critical to activity within this
series.

over the last decade boehringer ingelheim has published
several patent applications describing various simple
anilinoimidazolines as alpha1l selective agonists [41-44]. the
phenyl rings of these molecules generally have two or three
additional substituents, such as small alkyls, halides, small
alkoxyl and dimethylamino groups. while no actual receptor
subtype data was provided, several compounds (for example
24) were described as selective for increasing urethral
pressure versus blood pressure in a rabbit or dog model.

simpler imidazole compounds without the constraint of
the tetralin were also reported by abbott, and led to an
exciting idea. abt-866 (28) is an alpha1a agonist (600 nm, 80%
of phenylephrine maximal effect on rabbit urethra tissue)
that is a functional antagonist at alpha1b and alpha1d [51]. abbott
scientists hypothesized that selective alpha1a agonism may not
be sufficient for excellent uroselectivity, but that a
compound with alpha1a agonism and actual antagonism at alpha1b
and alpha1d subtypes would provide a better in vivo profile.
while a-61603 (21) is very selective for alpha1a, it still
possesses weak agonist activity at alpha1b and alpha1d subtypes in
isolated tissue strips. in an anesthetized dog model to
evaluate intraurethral pressure (iup) versus mean arterial
pressure (map), abt-866 (28) demonstrated a much better
map/iup ratio than a-61603 (21), the active metabolite of
midodrine st-1059 (20) and phenylephrine (3) (6.5 vs. 1.7,
1.3, and 0.4, respectively)[52]. a large scale synthesis of
abt-866 has been reported, indicating significant development activities [53]. however, there are no indications that
abt-866 is still being developed.

a constrained imidazoline compound containing the
methylsulfonamide and an adjacent hydroxyl on the phenyl
ring (a catechol mimic) was disclosed by abbott
laboratories scientists to be a very potent, selective alpha1a
agonist, a-61603 (21) (fig. (9)) [29,45,46]. a-61603 (21)
was selective for alpha1a in isolated tissue assays, and was
highly selective for alpha1a using both cloned animal and human
receptors. they also reported the activity of an analogue with
the sulfonamide replaced with a hydroxyl (25), and showed
that the sulfonamide that is present in a-61603 (and other
alpha1a selective agonists) provides better selectivity than the
corresponding catechol, presumably making it more difficult
for the molecule to bind and activate alpha1b and alpha1d subtypes.
abbott patent applications also exemplify related imidazoles
[47]. a-204176 (26), which is an imidazole analogue of a61603 lacking the hydroxyl group, is a full agonist at alpha1a but
with reduced affinity and selectivity in binding assays [48].
however, it possesses greater functional selectivity for alpha1a
versus alpha1b and alpha1d than a-61603 in isolated tissue strip
assays. excellent descriptions of the sar within the
imidazole series have been published [49,50]. for example,
sulfonamides such as a-204176 (26) have a relatively acidic
n-h proton that can mimic the phenol of the catechols and
make a potentially valuable hydrogen bond with a serine on
the receptor. interestingly, methylated compound 27 lacks

scientists at mitsui chemicals have filed a patent
application on uroselective compounds that are similar to a61603, but with the tetralin replaced with a chroman, for
instance 29 (fig. (9))[54]. while there is no data defining
these as  xxxg87xxx  agonists, based on structural similarity it seems a
safe assumption that they are  xxxg87xxx  agonists. similarly, a patent
application from kyowa hakko kogyo claims naphthyl-

aminoimidazolines such as compound 30 for urethral smooth
muscle contraction [55]. these compounds are structurally
similar to  xxxg87xxx  agonists  xxxd2698xxx  (9) and st 587 (16), and
30 was reported to be uroselective in a guinea pig model, so
these are also likely to be alpha1a agonists.

hoffmann-laroche has also patented a series of
imidazolines and imidazoles, including benzylimidazolines,
anilinoimidazolines, and phenoxymethylimidazolines, with
sulfonamides and related substituents in the 3-position of the
aromatic ring, such as 36 and 37 (fig. (11))[66]. a
subsequent patent application with more narrow claims
showed that benzylimidazolines with sulfonamides in the 4position of the aromatic ring were also alpha1a agonists, although
no selectivity data was provided [67]. of the six compounds
for which in vitro data was provided, the most potent was
compound 38, with an alpha1a pec50=7.12 (81% of
norepinephrine response) in a calcium mobilization assay.

a series of glaxo wellcome (now glaxosmithkline)
publications describe anilinomethylimidazolines, phenoxymethylimidazolines, and related imidazoles as alpha1a selective
agonists (fig. (10)) [56-62]. the best compounds generally
derive their selectivity from key substituents at the 2-position
on the aromatic ring. for instance, 31, 32 and 33 were
reported to have greater than 1000-fold functional agonist
selectivity for human alpha1a over alpha1b and alpha1d subtypes in
calcium mobilization assays.  xxxd3171xxx  was reported to
have better uroselectivity in an anesthetized dog model
(similar to the one described above) than ns-49 (22) and
phenylpropanolamine (map: iup ratio of 5.6 vs. 4.2 and
0.3, respectively) [63].

while no biological data for specific compounds was
provided in the patent application containing compounds 36
and 37, recent reports show that a clinical compound resulted
from this effort. compound 37 (ro 115-1240, dabuzalgron)
has been reported to be a selective partial agonist at the
alpha1a/1l receptor (calcium mobilization: alpha1a pec 50=7.47 (51%
of norepinephrine response); alpha1b pec 50<5.0; alpha1d pec 50<5.0)
and has good uroselectivity in rabbit and pig models [68]. in
this report the authors hypothesize that a selective alpha1a/1l
partial agonist will provide greater selectivity over vascular
effects than a full agonist, possibly due to natural differences
in receptor reserve between tissues. in a conscious pig
model, ro 115-1240, unlike the full agonist amidephrine,
produced its maximum effect on urethral pressure with no
effect on blood pressure or heart rate. ro 115-1240 has
completed a phase ii clinical trial, demonstrating improve-

hoffmann-laroche has patented similarly-substituted
indolemethylimidazolines as  xxxg87xxx  agonists, preferably as alpha1a/1l
agonists, such as compound 34 (fig. (11))[64]. selectivity
data was not provided, however in a functional assay
measuring intracellular calcium 34 demonstrated subnanomolar potency on the alpha1a subtype (pec50=9.08). an
interesting series of regioisomeric indoles was claimed in
another patent (e.g. compound 35), with no specific
compound data [65].

alpha1a agonists to treat stress urinary incontinence prefer no
brain exposure to limit undesirable side effects, and ro 1151240 does not readily penetrate the cns. however, the 28%
improvement versus placebo over four weeks did not meet
the efficacy hurdle set by roche, and the clinical development of ro 115-1240 was discontinued. according to
company reports, roche has reported taking another
compound (structure and mechanism undisclosed) into
clinical trials for stress urinary incontinence (r 1484). while
neither the structure nor mechanism have been disclosed yet,
given roche’s strong effort in the discovery and
understanding of  xxxg87xxx  receptor ligands, it is possible that this
compound is also some type of alpha1a agonist.

sdz nvi 085 penetrates into the central nervous system,
and was evaluated clinically as a treatment for dementia and
other cns disorders. while most of the therapeutic research
on alpha1a agonists has focused on stress urinary incontinence,
the varied effects of adrenergic receptor activation coupled
with the tissue localization of the alpha1a subtype has led to
patent claims for a number of other indications for alpha1a
agonists. these include sexual dysfunction, deficiencies in
attentiveness and cognition, depression, anxiety, eating
disorders, dementia, and alzheimer’s disease. more
common are claims for ailments that are commonly treated
with  xxxg87xxx  agonists, such as nasal congestion and otitis. in fact,
in support of the claims of alpha1a subtype selective agonists for
nasal decongestion, ns-49 (22) was shown to contract
guinea pig nasal mucosa vasculature, and the effect was
blocked by alpha1a selective antagonists but not by alpha1b or alpha1d
selective antagonists [85]. however, no recently described
selective alpha1a agonists appear to have been in clinical trials
for indications other than stress urinary incontinence.

sanofi-synthelabo (now sanofi aventis), co-developer
with nippon shinyaku of the former clinical compound ns49, patented a series of 3-(imidazolinylamino)benzenesulfonamides as alpha adrenoceptor agonists for stress urinary
incontinence, such as 39 (fig. (12)), which contain “reverse
sulfonamides” relative to ns-49, a-61603 and ro 115-1240
[70].

several alpha1a subtype selective agonists have been
identified, and a few have progressed into clinical trials for
stress urinary incontinence. demonstration of sufficient
efficacy at safe, tolerable doses appears to be difficult with
alpha1a subtype selective agonists. it may be possible that the
alpha1a subtype selective agonists evaluated thus far in the
clinic, given their small amine-containing structures, may
have off-target effects that contribute to unacceptable
therapeutic indices. however, the alpha1a subtype is present in
the heart and many other vascular tissues. adding to earlier
literature reports of the importance of the alpha1a subtype in
vasoconstriction is recent data from abbott showing a
correlation of alpha1a in vitro activity with mean arteriole
pressure increases (ped20) within a series of  xxxg87xxx  agonists
[49]. recent reports on transgenic mice lacking the
individual alpha1a subtype further support a role of the alpha1a
subtype in blood pressure regulation, as a lower resting
blood pressure was observed and the pressor effects of a61603 (21) were not observed in the knock-outs [86]. thus,
even though avoiding activation or even blocking endogenous activity on alpha1b and alpha1d subtypes while activating the
alpha1a subtype may provide a reduction in cardiovascular
effects, it may be difficult to achieve absolute uroselectivity.

sanofi has also filed a large series of patent applications
covering many bicyclic heteroaromatic compounds as
vasoconstrictors, with the examples clearly supporting
claims for treating stress urinary incontinence [71-83]. while
some of these, such as 40, are substituted phenethylamines
(and were stated to be  xxxg87xxx  agonists), several others, for
example 41, are  xxxd314xxx  derivatives with a pendant
alcohol (see fig. (12)). adrenergic receptor data was not
provided, but if compounds such as 41 are alpha1a agonists, they
represent an interesting structural departure from the typical
 xxxg87xxx  agonist pharmacophore, which has a basic amine three to
four bonds away from the lipophilic (usually aromatic) core.
according to company communications, sanofi progressed
an  xxxg87xxx  adrenoceptor agonist through phase iia clinical trials
(sl 25.1039), before discontinuing it in 2002 due to lack of
a therapeutic window versus cardiovascular effects. while
the structure of sl 25.1039 was not disclosed, it seems likely
that it is either a 3-(imidazolinylamino)benzenesulfonamide
or was exemplified in this series of patents.
sdz nvi 085 (11), one of the early  xxxg87xxx  agonist clinical
agents that was later found to have very good functional
agonism selectivity for the alpha1a subtype, has been pursued as
a lead for the development of novel alpha1a agonists. scientists
from synaptic pharmaceuticals presented a poster describing
a series of analogues of sdz nvi 085, but only two closely
related compounds were nearly as potent and selective, and
none improved upon the sdz nvi 085 profile (inositol

while there have been numerous reports of selective alpha1a
agonists and antagonists, there have been far fewer selective

subtypes. a few selective antagonists have been discovered
for these subtypes, such as bmy 7378, which is roughly
100-fold selective for alpha1d versus alpha1a and alpha1b [87]. however,
alpha1b and alpha1d selective agonists have been even more difficult
to find. using binding assays, several  xxxg87xxx  agonists, including
catecholamines phenylephrine and norepinephrine, are
reported to have ~20-fold greater affinity for the alpha1d subtype
compared to the alpha1b and alpha1a subtypes. however, in
functional agonist assays in intact cells, these same
compounds showed similar potencies at the three subtypes,
and there has been little evidence in the literature for
compounds with selective alpha1b or alpha1d agonism [4].
it has been reported that buspirone is a selective partial
agonist at the alpha1d subtype, based on isolated tissue assays
[15]. however, literature reports of alpha1b or alpha1d agonist
selectivity using cloned receptor systems are lacking.
based on the tissue expression profile of the alpha1b subtype
and the phenotype of the knockout mouse, there are several
possible diseases that could potentially be treated with an
alpha1b selective agonist, including narcolepsy, epilepsy, and
various cognitive disorders [21]. activation of all three
subtypes play a role in blood pressure and cause vasoconstriction in various tissues, and it is possible that an alpha1b or alpha1d
selective agonist could be useful for local vasoconstriction or
improved hypotension treatment. other utilities for an alpha1d
selective agonist are still poorly understood, but the
expression of the subtype in the cns could indicate a role in
attention and cognition [88]. the discovery of highly
selective alpha1b and alpha1d adrenoceptor agonists would provide
exciting pharmacological tools to further our understanding
of the roles of these receptor subtypes in vivo. however, the
lack of clear therapeutic potential for alpha1b or alpha1d
adrenoceptor agonists has limited the amount of research
directed toward this goal.
determinants of agonist binding and
subtype selectivity
some of the most exciting results in the field over the last
10-15 years have been from work to further our
understanding of the molecular interactions involved in
agonist binding and activation. the knowledge of the actual
amino acid sequences of the receptors, the ability to induce
functional expression of altered proteins within cells, and the
x-ray crystal structure of a related protein (rhodopsin) have
facilitated exploration of these interactions. site-directed
mutagenesis, the replacement of one amino acid by another,
has been an invaluable tool, often aided by molecular
modeling.
adrenoceptors are members of the large family of 7transmembrane g-protein coupled receptors that, when
functional, are located in the cellular membrane. the proteins have seven alpha-helices made up primarily of hydrophobic
residues that transverse the membrane and associate to form
a bundle, connected by six hydrophilic sections (three extracellular and three intracellular loops). while the transmembrane domains are largely hydrophobic, the binding site for
the endogenous adrenergic ligands needs to be hydrophilic,
as norepinephrine and epinephrine have positively charged
amines and several additional polar functional groups. in
fact, agonists bind through interactions with amino acids in

michael j. bishop

the transmembrane domains, and the g-protein is activated
via receptor-g-protein interactions within the intracellular
loops [89].
evidence indicates that rhodopsin, a much studied 7transmembrane receptor, is activated by the disruption of a
salt bridge between a  xxxd2431xxx  in transmembrane
domain three (tmd3) and a lysine in transmembrane
domain seven (tmd7) [90]. adrenergic receptors may be
activated via a similar mechanism. mutagenesis studies
using the alpha1b receptor subtype indicate that an  xxxd233xxx 
on tmd3 (asp125) forms a salt bridge with a lysine in
tmd7 (lys331) in the inactive state, as mutation of lys331
to an amino acid that cannot form a salt bridge leads to a
constitutively active receptor [91]. these residues are
conserved across  xxxg87xxx  adrenoceptors. a key interaction for
receptor activation is likely the interaction of the basic amine
of the  xxxg87xxx  agonist with this  xxxd233xxx  on tmd3, which
could weaken or break the interhelical salt bridge [91,92]. in
addition to the asp125 (and homologous aspartic acids on
alpha1a and alpha1d ), other amino acid residues have been shown to
be critical for agonist binding and activation. for the
endogenous adrenoceptor ligands, serines in tmd5 make
important interactions with the two hydroxyl groups of the
catechol. ligand binding studies with receptor mutants
suggest that for  xxxg87xxx  adrenoceptors the two serines (ser188 and
ser192 in alpha1a) each form only weak hydrogen bonds to the
catechol, and the meta-hydroxyl interaction with ser188 is
the strongest [93,94]. mutation studies have also helped
identify the likely important interactions of the beta-hydroxyl
group with serines on tmd2 and tmd7 [95]. this elegant
study provides the ligand-receptor molecular interactions to
support the easson-stedman hypothesis that defines the
stereochemical requirement for optimal catecholamine
binding. other residues appear to be important in  xxxg87xxx  agonist
binding, including phenylalanines that may interact with the
aromatic ring of the agonist, for instance phe310 in tmd6
(alpha1b ), phe163 in tmd4 (alpha1a ), and phe187 in tmd5 (alpha1a )
[96,97].
there is also alpha1b mutagenesis data to support a key role
of arg143 in tmd3 and glu289 in tmd6 forming an
important salt bridge, as disruption of this interaction also
leads to constitutive activity [98,99]. these residues are
toward the cytosolic end of the helical bundle, and disruption
of this interaction may lead to structural changes that allow
amino acids in the third intracellular loop (the region that
interacts directly with the g-protein) to achieve a
conformation that activates the g-protein.
based on sar differences and lack of cross desensitization, it has long been thought that phenethylamine and
imidazoline adrenoceptor agonists bind in different orientations within the ligand binding pocket [12,14]. mutation
study data supports this hypothesis. several mutants that
affect the binding of phenethylamines don’t affect imidazoline agonists [97,100]. mutations have been identified that
affect the binding of certain imidazolines but not phenethylamines, and interestingly, these mutations also effect
the binding of antagonists [101]. the locations of the various
amino acids give some indication of how the imidazolines
and phenethylamines may be oriented differently in the
binding site. the basic amines of both ligands presumably

recent advances in the discovery of  xxxg87xxx -adrenoceptor agonists

interact with the key  xxxd233xxx  residue in tmd3, but
modeling based on the mutation data suggests that the
aromatic ring of phenethylamines points toward tmd4,
while the aromatic ring of imidazolines is oriented toward
tmd7, higher up in the binding pocket [101].
site-directed mutagenesis has also been useful for the
identification of amino acids that appear to differentiate
agonist binding activity between  xxxg87xxx  receptor subtypes.
mutation of leu314 to methionine in tmd6 or ala204 to
valine in tmd5 of the alpha1b receptor subtype increased the
affinity of alpha1a selective agonists [102]. the double mutant
gave alpha1a-like binding activities for several agonists, and the
reciprocal alpha1a subtype double mutant gave decreased
activities, similar to the alpha1b wild type. based on the mutation
data and modeling, perez and co-workers hypothesized that a
hydrophobic ortho substituent on the phenyl ring of an
imidazoline  xxxg87xxx  agonist would lead to more favorable
interactions with the alpha1a subtype than with the alpha1b subtype,
which would lead to binding selectivity for the alpha1a subtype.
the different interactions between the methionine-valine pair
and the leucine-alanine pair, and the ligand’s ability to affect
these interactions may lead to the observed affinity
differences. further work indicated that bulk at the para
position of oxymetazoline (8), an imidazoline  xxxg87xxx  agonist
with a t-butyl group in this position, afforded selectivity for
alpha1a over the alpha1d subtype [103]. the alpha1d subtype has more
difficulty accommodating bulk at this position, possibly due
to the presence of a phenylalanine residue (phe360) on
tmd6 in a location where the alpha1a subtype has a leucine.
the combination of molecular modeling and site-directed
mutagenesis is yielding new information about how  xxxg87xxx 
agonists may bind and activate  xxxg87xxx  adrenoceptor subtypes,
and future work in this exciting area has the potential to aid
in the design of potent, selective ligands. so far the data
helps explain the alpha1a subtype selectivity that is commonly
found, but advances in this area that aid in the design of alpha1b
or alpha1d subtype selective agonists would be especially
valuable contributions to the field.

summary
[18]

research over the last decade has provided excellent
advances in our understanding of  xxxg87xxx  adrenoceptor subtype
structure, receptor-ligand interactions, signaling, and
function. there is still considerable territory to be explored,
including the function of the various subtypes in a number of
tissues, the role of dimers in adrenoceptor function, and the
further development of useful subtype-selective ligands.
many known  xxxg87xxx  adrenoceptor agonists are alpha1a selective,
and several pharmaceutical companies have been successful
in discovering subtype selective alpha1a agonists for clinical
evaluation, primarily for stress urinary incontinence. however, clinical success has proven difficult, and it remains to
be seen whether an alpha1a agonist can provide excellent efficacy without cardiovascular or other unwanted side effects.
the discovery of highly selective alpha1b and alpha1d adrenoceptor agonists has proven to be an extremely difficult goal
to achieve. success in this effort would be an exciting
development that could facilitate further exploration and
understanding of adrenergic receptor function.
