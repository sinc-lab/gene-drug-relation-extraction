bignami, a., w. s. lane, d. andrews and d. dahl. structural similarity of  xxxd2289xxx  bindingproteins in brain
and cartilage. brain res bull 22(l) 67-70, 1989. -a glial  xxxd2289xxx -binding
protein (chap) was isolated from human
brain white matter by affinity chromatography
on immobilized
 xxxd2289xxx .
the 60 kda protein appeared
remarkably
homogeneous
by reversed-phase

analysis. four cyanogen bromide peptides and 10 tryptic peptides were characterized
by amino acid sequence, a total of 12 sequences since overlaps were found between 2 cyanogen bromide and 2 tryptic peptide sequences. two sequences of brain  xxxg2407xxx  had similarity with rat link protein, a  xxxd2289xxx 
binding protein in cartilage. the region of similarity was contained in the evolutionary
conserved cooh-terminal
half of link
protein which is involved in the binding of  xxxd2289xxx .
the remaining
10 amino acid sequences of brain chap had no
similarity with link protein, nor with previously reported protein sequences. the findings suggest that the  xxxd2289xxx 
binding
domains of such diverse proteins as brain chap and  xxxg1018xxx  are similar, probably due to the fact that hyaluronic
acid is highly conserved in evolution.

lowing properties: 1) white matter specificity; 2) cell surface or
extracellular localization; 3) late appearance in ontogeny (axons
continue to grow until relatively late in development). furthermore, the white matter astrocytes appeared to be the most
likely site of production. radial glia serving gray matter and
white matter are the prominent type of astrocytes in fish and
amphibia, both capable of spinal cord regeneration.
hyaluronectin, a  xxxd2289xxx  binding protein isolated by
delpech and halavent (7) from human brain, was selected as
a possible candidate in a search of the literature for brain proteins sharing some properties with cartilage proteins. together
with myelinated white matter, cartilage is one of the few tissues of the body where axons do not grow.  xxxd2289xxx  and
proteoglycans form macromolecular complexes in cartilage
extracellular matrix due to noncovalent binding. the  xxxd2289xxx -proteoglycan complex is stabilized by the link protein,
another  xxxd2289xxx  binding protein (12).
immunohistological
studies conducted with hyaluronectin
polyclonal antibodies (4) were not compatible with our hypothesis. in accordance with a previous report (7) large amounts of
hyaluronectin immunoreactive material were found in embryonal brain and mesenchyma. however, with monoclonal antibodies obtained from mice immunized with hyaluronectin, we
were able to identify a glial  xxxd2289xxx  binding protein ( xxxg2407xxx )
with the expected properties of a putative axonal growth repellent, i.e., localization in white matter astrocytes and late
appearance in development (l-3). furthermore,  xxxg2407xxx  did not

working
on spinal cord injury and cns
plasticity have reached different conclusions concerning axonal
growth in mammalian cns. the inability of axons to regenerate in spinal cord has been repeatedly confirmed. conversely,
the sprouting of intact axons in many regions of the cns as a
result of partial denervation has been emphasized by several
investigators. although axonal sprouting from severed or intact
axons may be entirely different processes, a possibility to be
considered as the reason for the difference is that following
partial denervation axonal growth occurs in gray matter, while
in spinal cord injury axons fail to grow in myelinated white
matter. recent observations concerning the growth of serotonergic and adrenergic axons in denervated spinal cord appear
to support this hypothesis (10,17). in these experiments, rat spinal cord was depleted of serotonergic or adrenergic axons either
by transection or by injection of specific neurotoxins. suspensions of embryonic cells derived from the raphe (serotonergic
neurons) or the locus coeruleus (noradrenergic neurons) were
then injected into the denervated spinal cord. in both instances,
reinnervation of the spinal cord occurred through extensive axonal growth in gray matter. also, it should be noted that in
cns, the only examples of spontaneous true regeneration (i.e.,
growth from severed axons) occur in nonmyelinated tracts
(olfactory nerve and hypothalamo-hypophysial
tract).
if axons cannot grow in myelinated white matter, the next
step is to identify the white matter component preventing axonal growth. on theoretical grounds one could expect the folinvestigators

provide a suitable substrate for neuronal attachment and neurite extension in primary dissociated cultures (5). the finding
per se is not particularly compelling if one does not bear in
mind the localization
of  xxxg2407xxx  in white matter. after all,
many proteins do not provide a suitable substrate for axonal
growth. however, taking in consideration
the localization of
 xxxg2407xxx , it is possible to envisage a situation in which all available space in white matter is sealed by a protein nonconducive
to axonal growth.
the purpose of this communication
is to show that there are
structural similarities between  xxxg2407xxx  and a protein of cartilage
extracellular matrix, the link protein.
method

isolation
 xxxg2407xxx  was isolated from human white matter according to
the procedure of delpech and halavent (7) as reported (1).
briefly, the protein was extracted from the tissue with hcl at
ph 2.1, adsorbed on  xxxd2289xxx -sepharose
and eluted with 4 m
guanidine hcl. the fraction eluted from the column migrated
as a major band at approximately
60 kda by sds-page.

and discussion

figure 1 shows reversed-phase
hplc analysis of  xxxg2407xxx 
isolated from human white matter. the protein appeared remarkably homogenous
by this criterion considering that the
purification
is essentially one step procedure,
that is affinity
chromatography
on immobilized  xxxd2289xxx .
amino acid sequence analysis was done on cyanogen and
tryptic peptides. the amino terminus of the uncleaved protein
was blocked, whether as a natural event or an isolation artefact
remains to be determined. sequences were obtained from 4 cyanogen bromide peptides and 10 tryptic peptides. the sequences
of 2 tryptic peptides and 2 cyanogen bromide peptides overlapped. ten sequences of brain  xxxg2407xxx  were unique, i.e., no
significantly similar amino acid sequences were found when a
computer-assisted
search of the nbrf protein database was
performed
(9). this was rather surprising considering
that

by making the
solution 30 mm in dtt (calbiochem) and incubating at 37°c
for 2 hr, followed by alkylation with 70 mm iodoacetic acid
(sigma) for 20 min at room temperature
in the dark. when
completed, 2 ~1 of a 10% dtt solution was added to consume
any excess alkylating reagent. reduced and alkylated  xxxg2407xxx 
was then precipitated by adding 1 ml of 1% acetic acid in  xxxd102xxx , storing overnight at -20°c
and removing the supernatant after centrifugation.
the resulting pellet was then
washed with 1 ml of 70% ethanol (-20°c
overnight).

preparation of peptides
aliquots of approximately
500 pg of reduced and carboxymethylated  xxxg2407xxx  were subjected to digestion with either cyanogen bromide or trypsin. briefly, for reaction with cyanogen
bromide,  xxxg2407xxx  was dissolved in 200-500 ~1 of 70% formic
acid/l00 mg/ml cnbr. the reaction was allowed to proceed
at room temperature,
in the dark, for 24 hr. for trypsin,

peptide purification
peptides were separated by microbore hplc on a hewlettpackard 1090 hplc equipped with a 1040 diode array detector, using a brownlee c8 column (2.1~100 mm). a linear
gradient of 2 to 80% acetonitrile in 0.1% trifluoroacetic
acid
over 45 min was used at a flow rate of 200 @min. fractions
were manually collected while monitoring absorbance at 220 nm
and allowing for a calculated 7 set delay volume.
chromatographic
data at 220 and 280 nm, and uv spectra from 214 to
320 nm of each fraction were obtained.

fig. 3. comparison of chap tryptic peptide t37 with link protein from rat cartilage (14). amino acids of t37 are num-

bered arbitrarily. the gap (.) at position 21 of t37 is introduced to maximize the regions of similarity. identical residues
are enclosed by a solid line. residues which represent common changes based upon the dayhoff tables of evolutionary
similarity (6) are enclosed by a dashed line. cysteinezw and cysteine2*9 are probably involved in the secondary structure
of the  xxxd2289xxx -bjnding domain of link protein [see fig. 3 in (1411.

 xxxg2407xxx  is a major component

of white matter (approximately
5 mg protein from 50 g of wet brain tissue). conversely, two
amino acid sequences of brain  xxxg2407xxx  demonstrated strong
similarity to  xxxg1018xxx  (figs. 2 and 3).
the link protein is a 40 kda  xxxd2289xxx  binding-protein
stabilizing the  xxxd2289xxx -proteoglycan
ionic interactions
which result in the formation of macromolecular complexes in
cartilage extracellular matrix (12). the nh2-terminal half of
the molecule probably binds proteoglycan. it was recently demonstrated that the evolutionary conserved cooh-terminal part
binds  xxxd2289xxx  (11, 13, 14, 16). the  xxxd2289xxx -binding
region contains tandemly repeated sequences forming two loops
due to the formation of disulfide bonds between cysteine residues [see fig. 3 in (14)].
with both chap sequences, the region of homology was
contained in the nhz-terminal part of the link protein loops,
the alignment of 3 cysteine residues involved in disulfide bond
formation makes it unlikely that the similarity was occurring
by chance. this was particularly true for one of the two  xxxg2407xxx 

sequences aligning with 2 cysteine residues, i.e., cysticand
cys**s in the link protein sequence.
it was reported that cartilage proteoglycan and link protein
have similar structures within their hy~uronate binding regions
(15). this, together with our findings, suggests that the  xxxd2289xxx  binding domain is relatively conserved in proteins
which otherwise are very different.
finally, we do not have an explanation for the differences
between hyaluronectin and  xxxg2407xxx , both with respect to their
localization and their biochemical properties in&ding amino
acid composition (unpublished results). a possibility to be considered is that cerebral gray matter and white matter contain
different  xxxd2289xxx -binding proteins. hyaluronectin was isolated from whole brain extracts while in the case of  xxxg2407xxx  dissected white matter served as the starting material.
