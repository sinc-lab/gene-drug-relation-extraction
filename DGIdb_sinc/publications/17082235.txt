abstract
most drugs currently employed in the treatment of type 2
diabetes either target the sulfonylurea receptor stimulating insulin release (sulfonylureas, glinides), or target the peroxisome
proliferator-activated receptor (ppar␥) improving insulin resistance (thiazolidinediones). our work shows that sulfonylureas
and glinides additionally bind to ppar␥ and exhibit ppar␥
agonistic activity. this activity was predicted in silico by virtual
screening and confirmed in vitro in a binding assay, a transactivation assay, and by measuring the expression of ppar␥
target genes. among the measured compounds,  xxxd2205xxx 
and  xxxd2204xxx  (two sulfonylureas), as well as  xxxd2702xxx  (a glinide), exhibit ppar␥ agonistic activity at concentrations comparable with those reached under pharmacological treatment. the

poor eating habits and sedentary lifestyle have led to an
increasing prevalence of metabolic disorders, such as type 2
diabetes mellitus, which is attaining epidemic proportions
(world health organization, 2002). primary prevention by
dietary adjustments and increased exercise remains the most
desirable and cost-effective strategy. nevertheless, pharmacotherapeutic intervention to prevent severe immediate and
long-term consequences of type 2 diabetes is often unavoidable.
the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (ppars)
are involved in the regulation of lipid and glucose metabolism
(willson et al., 2001). they are ligand-dependent transcripthis research was funded by the swiss commission for technical innovation (kti/cti, grant 6570.2 mts-ls).

most active of these compounds,  xxxd2205xxx , is shown to be as
potent as pioglitazone at inducing ppar␥ target gene expression. this dual mode of action of sulfonylureas and glinides
may open new perspectives for the molecular pharmacology of
antidiabetic drugs, because it provides evidence that drugs can
be designed that target both the sulfonylurea receptor and
ppar␥. targeting both receptors could increase pancreatic
insulin secretion and improve insulin resistance. glinides, sulfonylureas, and other acidified sulfonamides may be promising
leads in the development of new ppar␥ agonists. in addition,
we provide a unified concept of the ppar␥ binding ability of
seemingly disparate compound classes.

tion factors that contain an n-terminal activation domain, a
dna-binding domain, and a ligand-binding domain (renaud
and moras, 2000). ppars activate target genes by binding to
response elements located within regulatory regions of these
target genes (laudet and gronemeyer, 2002). accessory proteins, termed coactivators and corepressors, associate with
dna-bound ppars and modulate the expression of target
genes through chromatin structure modifications and recruitment of the transcription machinery (hermanson et al.,
2002). three subclasses of ppars are known, called ␣, ␥, and
␦, that are coded by different genes, exhibit tissue-specific
expression patterns, and are associated with various functions. of these, ppar␥ is expressed mostly in adipose tissue,
where it is essential in adipocyte differentiation and controls
the storage of  xxxd2154xxx , increasing triglyceride synthesis
and storage within adipocytes. in addition, there is strong
evidence that ppar␥ regulates glucose homeostasis (willson

the consequent biological activity. we followed a three-step
approach. first, a virtual screening search on two large databases of drugs and biologically active compounds allowed
us to identify a few glinides and sulfonylureas as promising
ppar␥ ligands and prompted us to concentrate on these two
drug classes, screening several more members thereof. most
of these compounds showed good affinities to ppar␥ in silico.
in a second step, we found that selected sulfonylureas and
glinides bind to ppar␥ and enhance ppar␥-mediated gene
expression in vitro. in a third step, encouraged by these
results, we screened in silico a few new compounds related to
the sulfonylureas (i.e., n-acylsulfonamides), resulting in the
prediction that they would bind ppar␥ with relatively high
binding affinities.
sulfonylureas and glinides are hypoglycemic drugs in clinical use for the treatment of type 2 diabetes, by virtue of their
insulin secretagogue properties. these compounds bind to
the sulfonylurea receptor  xxxg19xxx  on the membrane of ␤-cells,
triggering the closure of the nearby  xxxg1232xxx ,
which in turns leads the ␤-cell to increase insulin secretion
(farret et al., 2005). our discovery that some insulin secretagogue drugs activate ppar␥ has attractive implications for
the pharmacological treatment of type 2 diabetes. moreover,
sulfonylureas and n-acylsulfonamides are new classes of
ppar␥ agonists.

materials and methods
virtual screening database. the therastrat ag inhouse database (hug et al., 2003; gut and bagatto, 2005) contains most
marketed drugs and many of their metabolites (approximately 8000
compounds). the freely available chembank database contains approximately 6000 bioactive compounds (http://chembank.broad.
harvard.edu).
ligand docking. each compound was docked into the ppar␥
binding site using the autodock 3.0.5 software (morris et al., 1998).
autodock finds several low-energy arrangements (“poses”) of a given
flexible ligand into a given receptor assumed to be rigid. for each
pose, a pki value is calculated. the ppar␥ three-dimensional structure was obtained from protein data bank entry 1fm9. this is a
2.1-å resolution crystal structure of the heterodimer of the human
retinoid x receptor ␣ and ppar␥ ligand binding domains, bound to
9  xxxd2404xxx  and farglitazar, respectively, together with coactivator peptides (gampe et al., 2000). the ppar␥-farglitazar complex was imported in moe (chemical computing group inc., montreal, qc, canada) where hydrogens were added and energyminimized. the resulting structure without farglitazar was imported
in autodock, where the protonation state of acidic and basic groups
was adjusted (his323 and his449 were protonated), and partial
charges were assigned. the protonation state of ligands to be docked
was adjusted to the species assumed predominant at physiological
ph. in particular, carboxylic acid, thiazolidinedione, sulfonylurea,
and n-acylsulfonamide moieties were deprotonated. partial charges
were assigned according to the mmff94x force field (moe). for
method verification and calibration, we docked to ppar␥ a set of 121
carboxylic acids that are ppar␥ agonists with known experimental
binding affinities, a collection detailed in our earlier work (rücker et
al., 2006). for the compounds whose best pose showed both carboxylate oxygen atoms within 2 å of the corresponding atoms of farglitazar in the x-ray structure (83% of the total), the pki calculated by
autodock and the experimental pki correlated with r2 ⫽ 0.6 (slope
and intercept of the linear regression were 0.9 and 3.5, respectively).
because in this test autodock consistently overestimated experimental pki values, all calculated pki values given in the following
are linearly rescaled using the above numbers for slope and inter-

et al., 2000, 2001; wang and tafuri, 2003; rangwala and
lazar, 2004). activation of ppar␥ improves insulin resistance, and therefore ppar␥ is an established molecular target for the treatment of type 2 diabetes (perfetti and
d’amico, 2005; staels and fruchart, 2005).
for ppar␥, several unsaturated  xxxd2154xxx  have been
proposed as natural ligands, in particular prostaglandins
such as 15-deoxy-⌬12,14-prostaglandin j2 (ferry et al., 2001),
nitrolinoleic acids such as 10-nitrolinoleic acid (schopfer et
al., 2005), and putative metabolites of docosahexaenoic acid
such as 4-hydroxydocosahexaenoic acid (yamamoto et al.,
2005). a few synthetic ppar␥ agonists are approved drugs
[e.g., rosiglitazone, pioglitazone, which are members of the
glitazone (thiazolidinedione) class (willson et al., 2001)] or
are under development as antidiabetics [e.g., tesaglitazar
(ericsson et al., 2004) and muraglitazar (cox, 2005)]. see fig.
1 for chemical structures. all ppar␥ agonists in clinical use
or development (in fact, most known ppar␥ agonists) are
either thiazolidinediones or carboxylic acids (martin et al.,
2005). many drug therapies targeting ppar␥ have their
disadvantages [e.g., the liver toxicity of glitazones (hug et al.,
2004), weight gain, fluid retention, enhanced adipogenesis,
and cardiac hypertrophy (picard and auwerx, 2002)]. the
development of an otherwise promising ppar␥ ligand and
drug candidate, farglitazar (see fig. 1), had to be discontinued in phase iii because of the emergence of edema (parker,
2002; shi et al., 2005). therefore, demand is increasing for
new ppar␥ ligands, and compound classes other than
carboxylic acids or thiazolidinediones could be of special
interest.
the goal of the present study was to identify new ppar␥
agonists among known drugs and biologically active compounds by combining virtual screening with experimental
verification in biological assays. this strategy provides a
detailed model of ligand-receptor complexes, together with
an experimental confirmation of ligand-receptor binding and

measurement of ppar␥ target gene expression. 3t3-l1
fibroblasts were purchased from european collection of cell cultures (porton down, wiltshire, uk). they were amplified in dmem/
10% calf serum and subsequently seeded into six-well plates. two
days after the cells reached confluence, the medium was changed to
dmem/10% fetal calf serum containing 0.5 m  xxxd2388xxx , 2 ␮g/ml insulin (actrapid), and 0.5 ␮m dexamethasone, to
which the experimental compounds were added. two days after
induction of the cells, the medium was changed to dmem/10% fetal
calf serum containing 2 ␮g/ml insulin, to which the experimental
compounds were freshly added. compounds were tested at the following concentrations: rosiglitazone, 1 ␮m; pioglitazone, 10 ␮m;
 xxxd2205xxx , 10 ␮m;  xxxd2204xxx , 100 and 200 ␮m;  xxxd2702xxx , 50 and
200 ␮m; and  xxxd3098xxx , 50, 100, and 200 ␮m. the cells were
harvested in trizol (invitrogen, breda, the netherlands) 5 days
after induction, and rna was isolated by the standard procedure.
rna (1 ␮g) was used for cdna synthesis using iscript (bio-rad
laboratories, veenendaal, the netherlands). cdna was amplified
with platinum taq polymerase using sybr green on a biorad myiq
cycler. specificity of the amplification was verified by melt curve
analysis and evaluation of the amplification efficiency. subsequently, expression of the genes of interest was normalized using
 xxxg798xxx  as housekeeping gene.
the following primers were used: ap2: forward, aagaagtgggagtgggcttt; reverse, aatccccatttacgctgatg; glut4:

results
in a first step, all compounds in the therastrat and chembank databases were docked to ppar␥. among them,  xxxd3098xxx  (a carboxylic acid belonging to the glinide group of
drugs), sulfadimidine (an acidified sulfonamide), and
 xxxd2203xxx  (a sulfonylurea) were thereby assigned relatively
high binding affinities (scarsi et al., 2005). in a second step of
virtual screening, we focused on these compound classes,
docking several more members thereof, as well as structurally related compounds.
several glinides and sulfonylureas are docked to
ppar␥ with a high binding affinity. figure 2, a to c,
depict  xxxd3098xxx ,  xxxd2702xxx , and  xxxd2654xxx , respectively,
docked into ppar␥ and superimposed to the farglitazar complex x-ray structure (for structures, see fig. 3). the predicted
bound conformations to ppar␥ are similar to that of farglitazar. the carboxylate group of the glinides superimposes
well with that of farglitazar, forming hydrogen bonds with
residues his323, his449, ser289, and tyr473 of ppar␥, as
farglitazar does.  xxxd3098xxx  forms several hydrophobic contacts in the large  xxxd1850xxx  cavity (fig. 2a, bottom left) that in
the case of farglitazar is occupied by its long hydrophobic tail.
 xxxd2702xxx  and  xxxd2654xxx  fit well the smaller hydrophobic
cavity (fig. 2, b and c, bottom right) that in the farglitazar
complex is occupied by the benzoylphenyl group.
 xxxd3098xxx ,  xxxd2654xxx ,  xxxd2702xxx , and meglitinide are
predicted to bind ppar␥ with pki values of 7.2, 6.3, 5.9, and
5.0, respectively. the smaller molecules  xxxd2654xxx , nateg-

cept. among the many poses returned by autodock for each compound, we selected as best the one assigned the highest pki value,
provided it had a hydrogen bond to tyr473 and at least two further
hydrogen bonds to his323, his449, or ser289. in all ppar␥-ligand
complexes with known x-ray structures, such hydrogen bonds seem
to be essential for binding (nolte et al., 1998; gampe et al., 2000;
cronet et al., 2001; xu et al., 2001; sauerberg et al., 2002), and the
hydrogen bond to tyr473 was proposed to play a vital role for ppar␥
coactivator recruitment (cronet et al., 2001), which justify the constraints above.
reagents and plasmids. standard cell culture and transfection
reagents were purchased from invitrogen (carlsbad, ca). charcoalstripped delipidated fbs was purchased from sigma-aldrich (buchs,
switzerland).  xxxd2205xxx  was purchased from apin chemicals
(oxon, uk);  xxxd2204xxx ,  xxxd2203xxx ,  xxxd3098xxx , and linoleic acid were
purchased from sigma-aldrich;  xxxd2702xxx  was purchased from toronto research chemicals inc. (north york, on, canada); and
 xxxd2654xxx  and pioglitazone were purchased from molekula ltd.
(dorset, uk). the 3xppre-luc vector was kindly provided by ron
evans (the salk institute for biological studies, san diego, ca). the
expression vector encoding human ppar␥ was provided by walter
wahli (centre integratif de genomique, lausanne, switzerland).
ligand binding assay. the green polarscreen ppar competitor assay (invitrogen) was used according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. this cell-free assay is based on purified recombinant
human ppar␥ ligand-binding domain and a selective fluorescent
ppar␥ ligand. the complex between the ligand and the ligandbinding domain exhibits high fluorescence polarization, which is lost
upon ligand displacement by nonlabeled competitors. millipolarization values for different competitors were determined in a viewlux
reader (perkinelmer life and analytical sciences, boston, ma) by
measuring the fluorescence intensities of the s (parallel to excitation) and p (perpendicular to excitation) channels, and background
fluorescence of the assay buffer was subtracted. relative specific
activity (ar) was determined by scaling measured values according
to ar ⫽ (v ⫺ b)/(c ⫺ b), where v is the value measured, and b and
c are the median millipolarization values of 0% and 100% control
wells. ic50 values (concentrations at which 50% of the fluorescent
ligand is displaced) and pic50 values (negative decadic logarithm of
ic50) were determined for test compounds by measuring ar values
for a series of concentrations. a four-parametric sigmoidal curve was
fitted to each data set using datafactory (biofocus dpi, allschwil,
switzerland) or data analysis toolbox (elsevier mdl, san ramon,
ca), and the ic50 value was determined from the fitted curve.
transactivation assay. cv-1 cells were cultured in dmem
(4500 mg/l glucose), supplemented with 10% fbs and 50 u of penicillin/streptomycin. three days before transfection, cells were steroldepleted by exchanging the culture medium to dmem/ham’s f12
medium without phenol red, supplemented with 10% charcoalstripped fbs and 50 u of penicillin/streptomycin. cells were plated
in a 96-well dish with a density of 5 ⫻ 105 cells/ml (100 ␮l per well).
dna transfection was carried out in optimem i (invitrogen) without phenol red using lipofectamine (invitrogen). each well received
8 ng of expression vector, 20 ng of reporter vector, and 60 ng of
␤-galactosidase vector. twenty-four hours after transfection, drugs
dissolved in  xxxd1896xxx  were added in dmem/ham’s f12
without phenol red, supplemented with 10% charcoal-stripped delipidated fbs (sigma-aldrich), and 50 u of penicillin/streptomycin.
sixteen hours after addition of drugs, cells were lysed in chloramphenicol acetyltransferase assay lysis buffer (catalys ag/promega,
wallisellen, switzerland). supernatants were analyzed for luciferase
activity by addition of luciferase reagent (catalys ag/promega).
background normalization was carried out by measuring ␤-galactosidase activity as described previously (iniguez-lluhi et al., 1997).
ec50 values (concentrations at which 50% of the maximal gene
expression is induced) and pec50 values (negative decadic logarithm
of ec50) were determined for test compounds by measuring the
increase of ppar␥ target gene expression induced at different con-

linide, and meglitinide (molecular mass, ⬍350 da) bind at a
lower affinity compared with the larger  xxxd3098xxx  (molecular mass, 453 da), because the latter forms more favorable
contacts between the hydrophobic cavities of the ppar␥
binding site and its large hydrophobic moieties.
figure 2, d to f, show  xxxd2205xxx ,  xxxd2203xxx , and  xxxd2204xxx , respectively, docked into ppar␥ and superimposed to
the farglitazar complex x-ray structure (for structures, see
fig. 3). the predicted binding mode of  xxxd2205xxx  and
 xxxd2203xxx  in the polar part of the binding site exhibits
interesting similarities to that of farglitazar. in analogy to

the carboxylate oxygens of farglitazar, the sulfonamide oxygen atoms point toward the pocket built by the side chains of
his323, his449, ser289, and tyr473 and form hydrogen
bonds to the h donor atoms in these residues. it is noteworthy that in the case of  xxxd2205xxx  and  xxxd2203xxx , there are
two alternatives for h-bond formation to his449, either to a
sulfonyl oxygen or to the urea oxygen atom.  xxxd2203xxx 
deviates considerably in the lower part of the binding cavity
from the bound conformation of farglitazar. this is not unexpected, because this part of the binding cavity is wide,
allowing some conformational freedom for the ligand (nolte

measured in the binding assay were also tested in a cellbased transactivation assay for ppar␥ agonistic activity. all
tested compounds activate ppar␥, albeit at various concentrations. figure 3 reports the increase in gene expression
induced by these compounds.
among the sulfonylureas tested,  xxxd2205xxx  is the most
potent ppar␥ agonist (pec50 5.0), followed by  xxxd2204xxx 
(pec50 4.6) and  xxxd2203xxx  (pec50 4.0). among the tested
glinides,  xxxd3098xxx  shows the highest potency (pec50 4.8),
followed by  xxxd2702xxx  (pec50 4.0) and  xxxd2654xxx  (pec50
3.7). as for the standard agonists, pioglitazone (pec50 6.0)
was found to be far more active than linoleic acid (pec50 3.2).
for pioglitazone, ppar␥ activity was reported at concentrations approximately 5 times lower than those found here
(ferry et al., 2001; minoura et al., 2004; inukai et al., 2005).
hence, the sensitivity of our experimental setup may be
somewhat low, and the true minimum concentrations of the
drugs needed for ppar␥ activation may be lower than found
here.
ranking the compounds by decreasing potency, pioglitazone is followed by the sulfonylureas ( xxxd2205xxx ,  xxxd2204xxx ,
 xxxd2203xxx ), the glinides ( xxxd3098xxx ,  xxxd2702xxx ,  xxxd2654xxx ), and by linoleic acid.  xxxd2205xxx  approaches pioglitazone
in terms of potency, reaching similar agonistic activity at a
concentration 1 order of magnitude higher.
sulfonylureas and glinides enhance ppar␥-induced target gene expression. the effects of  xxxd2205xxx ,
 xxxd2204xxx ,  xxxd2702xxx ,  xxxd3098xxx , pioglitazone, and rosiglitazone on the expression of ppar␥ target genes were measured in 3t3-l1 fibroblasts. for the sulfonylureas and glinides, concentrations bracketing ec50 values from the
activation study were chosen (see materials and methods).
three bona fide target genes of ppar␥ (knouff and auwerx,
2004) were selected for analysis by quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction: adiponectin, ap2, and
glut4.  xxxd2205xxx ,  xxxd2702xxx , and  xxxd2204xxx  significantly
enhanced the expression of these genes. for these three
compounds, maximal induction was observed at the lowest
measured concentration (10 ␮m for  xxxd2205xxx , 50 ␮m for
 xxxd2702xxx , and 50 ␮m for  xxxd2204xxx ). in contrast,  xxxd3098xxx 
showed no induction at concentrations ranging from 50 to
200 ␮m. figure 4 shows the results for the selected sulfonylureas and glinides, together with pioglitazone as positive
control. the induction of gene expression is reported relative
to that observed in the presence of 1 ␮m rosiglitazone, a
strong thiazolidinedione ppar␥ agonist.  xxxd2205xxx  is as
potent as pioglitazone and  xxxd1891xxx  ␮m causes approximately
80% of the induction observed in the presence of 1 ␮m rosiglitazone. nateglide and  xxxd2204xxx  show somewhat lower
activities (between 30% and 70% compared with 1 ␮m
rosiglitazone) at higher concentrations compared with
 xxxd2205xxx .
acidified sulfonamides other than sulfonylureas
are docked to ppar␥ with a high binding affinity.
because the docking study did not reveal any significant
role in ppar␥ binding for the second n atom of the sulfonylureas, we replaced this terminal nh in silico with ch2,
arriving at carbon analogs of  xxxd2203xxx , glisamuride, and
 xxxd2215xxx  (n-acylsulfonamides; fig. 5). these compounds were subjected to the docking procedure, which
resulted in predicted pki values of 7.2, 7.2, and 6.9, respectively.

et al., 1998; xu et al., 1999).  xxxd2204xxx  exhibits a slightly
different binding mode compared with  xxxd2205xxx  and
 xxxd2203xxx , in that the sulfonyl group does not superpose to
the carboxylate of farglitazar. in this case, two hydrogen
bonds are formed by the urea oxygen atom with tyr473 and
with his449, whereas the deprotonated sulfonamide nitrogen
forms a hydrogen bond with ser289. here, the deprotonated
amide seems to be almost as good a mimic of farglitazar’s
carboxylate as the sulfonyl group is in the other examples.
many sulfonylureas are predicted to bind ppar␥, with pki
values ranging from 3.7 to 8.8 (table 1). as in the case of the
glinides, smaller sulfonylureas such as  xxxd3394xxx  and
chlorpropramide (molecular weight ⬍300) are assigned
lower binding affinities (pki, ⬃4) than larger ones such
as  xxxd2203xxx ,  xxxd2204xxx , and glisamuride (molecular weight
⬎400, pki, ⬃6–8). the larger molecules form a higher number of favorable contacts to the hydrophobic walls of the
receptor’s binding cavity.
sulfonylureas and glinides bind to ppar␥. the predicted ppar␥ ligands  xxxd2205xxx ,  xxxd2204xxx ,  xxxd2203xxx ,  xxxd3098xxx ,  xxxd2702xxx , and  xxxd2654xxx , as well as two known
ligands, linoleic acid, an endogenous agonist, and pioglitazone, a synthetic drug used in the treatment of type 2 diabetes (all selected for commercial availability), were tested in a
ppar␥ competitor binding assay.  xxxd2205xxx ,  xxxd2203xxx ,
 xxxd3098xxx ,  xxxd2702xxx , pioglitazone, and linoleic acid bind
to ppar␥ and completely displace the reference ligand at
different concentrations. the pic50 values resulting from
this experiment are 5.1 for  xxxd2205xxx , 3.9 for  xxxd2203xxx , 2.8
for  xxxd3098xxx , 3.5 for  xxxd2702xxx , 6.5 for pioglitazone, and
6.6 for linoleic acid.  xxxd2204xxx  and  xxxd2654xxx  partially displace the reference ligand at concentrations between 500 and
2000 ␮m (maximal concentration measured), but ic50 values
could not be determined.

the major results of this work are that several sulfonylurea and glinide drugs bind to and activate ppar␥ in vitro
and that a detailed three-dimensional binding mode underlying this activation is proposed. experimental evidence for
direct binding to ppar␥ has been provided in a competitor
binding assay, whereas ppar␥ agonistic activity was measured both in a transactivation assay and by observing target
gene levels in 3t3-l1 cells. in all these experiments,  xxxd2205xxx  showed the strongest ppar␥ agonistic activity among
the measured sulfonylureas and glinides.
while this study was underway, two sulfonylureas,
 xxxd2203xxx  and  xxxd2215xxx , were reported to activate
ppar␥ (fukuen et al., 2005; inukai et al., 2005). our work
provides strong evidence that additional sulfonylureas, as
well as glinides (which equally target the sulfonylurea receptor), can bind and activate ppar␥ and allows the interpretation of binding data based on docking results.
sulfonylureas and glinides are standard treatments for
type 2 diabetes. so far, members of these classes were presumed to act by a mechanism independent of ppar␥. according to this mechanism, they bind to the sulfonylurea receptor
 xxxg19xxx  in pancreatic islet ␤ cells, closing k⫹ channels and
leading to increased insulin production (farret et al., 2005).
in contrast, here we provide evidence that binding to and
activating ppar␥ may be a new mode of action for at least
some of these drugs, resulting in enhanced insulin sensitivity
in peripheral tissue. this discovery opens new pharmacological perspectives for drugs targeting both  xxxg19xxx  and ppar␥.
for this hypothesis to be useful from a clinical point of

view, it is important that the minimal drug concentrations
required for ppar␥ activity are reached under pharmacological treatment.
according to our measurements,  xxxd2205xxx  starts exhibiting a significant ppar␥ agonistic activity at a concentration
of 5 ␮m. the mean maximal plasma concentration (cmax) of
 xxxd2205xxx  measured in diabetic patients treated with a
30-mg dose is 1.2 ␮m, with a range going from 0.2 to 4.0 ␮m
(von nicolai et al., 1997). the maximum recommended single
dose of  xxxd2205xxx  is 60 mg, and the maximum daily dose is
180 mg (anonymous, 2001). hence, we can conclude that
 xxxd2205xxx  activates ppar␥ at pharmacologically relevant
concentrations.
for  xxxd2204xxx , which activates ppar␥  xxxd1891xxx  ␮m, measured cmax values are 1.0 ⫾ 0.3 ␮m in patients treated
with a 5-mg dose (jaber et al., 1996).  xxxd2204xxx  cmax values
are approximately 40% higher in chinese than in white
patients (jönsson et al., 2000). the suggested maximal
single dose of  xxxd2204xxx  is 15 mg (40 mg is the maximum
daily dose; http://www.pfizer.com/pfizer/download/uspi_
 xxxd2204xxx .pdf). this may lead to  xxxd2204xxx  concentrations in
the plasma where ppar␥ activation starts being significant.
cmax values for  xxxd2203xxx  can reach 1 ␮m after a single
8-mg dose (langtry and balfour, 1998), which is the suggested maximum single dose (http://www.fda.gov/cder/foi/
label/2002/20496s7lbl.pdf). this is 2 orders of magnitude below the  xxxd2203xxx  concentration required for ppar␥ activation according to our measurements (100 ␮m). however, in
similar experiments, other authors reported  xxxd2203xxx 
ppar␥ agonistic activity at 1 and 10 ␮m (fukuen et al.,
2005; inukai et al., 2005).
for  xxxd2702xxx , a cmax value of 18 ␮m has been reported
in patients treated with a 120-mg dose (luzio et al., 2001;
weaver et al., 2001; mcleod, 2004). the maximum recommended single dose of  xxxd2702xxx  is 180 mg (http://www.
 xxxd2702xxx .info/ xxxd2702xxx /content/pages/basic.php). according to
our measurements,  xxxd2702xxx  starts exhibiting ppar␥
agonistic activity between 10 and 100 ␮m. hence, phar-

sulfonylureas and glinides exhibit ppar␥ activity

fig. 5. structures of carbon analogs of  xxxd2203xxx , glisamuride, and
 xxxd2215xxx  (n-acylsulfonamides).

these properties are highly important for binding (nolte et
al., 1998; gampe et al., 2000; cronet et al., 2001; xu et al.,
2001; sauerberg et al., 2002; ebdrup et al., 2003). sulfonamides (3) are not sufficiently acidic for binding unless
acidified by a substituent such as an acyl group ⫺c(⫽o)r⬘
that stabilizes the conjugate base by further delocalizing
the negative charge. at the same time, such a substituent
provides another h bond acceptor atom, the carbonyl oxygen. the compound classes shown or predicted here to be
ppar␥ ligands, sulfonylureas [4, r⬘ ⫽ (substituted)
amino] and n-acylsulfonamides [4, r⬘ ⫽ (substituted) alkyl or aryl, pka values of ⬃5] smoothly fit into this picture.
other compound classes exhibiting similar or higher acidity and similar h acceptor ability of their anions were
recently shown to be ppar␥ ligands [oxazolidinediones
(momose et al., 2002b), tetrazoles (momose et al., 2002a),
phosphates, and thiophosphates (durgam et al., 2005)].
circumstantial evidence for our views is provided by the
observation that the succinimide analog of an antihyperglycemic thiazolidinedione (2, but s replaced by ch2, pka
9.7), as well as the corresponding n-methylthiazolidinedione, are both inactive (cantello et al., 1994). thus, a unified understanding of the ppar␥ binding ability of seemingly disparate compound classes is emerging.

aryl], or the respective anions. in the anions, oxygen and nitrogen
atoms participating in charge delocalization as indicated are potential
hydrogen bond acceptors. both sulfonyl oxygen atoms are equivalent.
for simplicity, charge delocalization onto the second sulfonyl oxygen
atom is not shown.

macological concentrations of  xxxd2702xxx  may be sufficient
for activating ppar␥. indeed, ppar␥ activation might
explain the beneficial effects on insulin resistance recently
observed in patients with diabetes treated with  xxxd2702xxx  (hazama et al., 2006).
 xxxd3098xxx  levels in the plasma can be as high as 0.4 ␮m
after a 4-mg dose, which is the highest recommended single
dose (owens et al., 2000; culy and jarvis, 2001; hatorp,
2002). this concentration is below the minimal  xxxd3098xxx 
concentration (around 10 ␮m) at which we observed ppar␥
activation. hence,  xxxd3098xxx  does not seem to show ppar␥
activity under pharmacological treatment.
 xxxd2654xxx  starts exhibiting ppar␥ agonistic activity at
between 100 and 250 ␮m. this concentration is above the
cmax value measured in a patient treated with an unspecified dose of  xxxd2654xxx  (1.6 ␮m) (anonymous, 2004).
to summarize, there is evidence that  xxxd2205xxx ,  xxxd2204xxx ,
and  xxxd2702xxx  may activate ppar␥ at pharmacologically
relevant concentrations, whereas  xxxd2203xxx ,  xxxd3098xxx ,
and  xxxd2654xxx  only activate ppar␥ at concentrations
higher than the those reached under clinical circumstances.
our computational results strongly suggest to experimentally test members of the third compound class considered, n-acylsulfonamides (n-sulfonylcarboxamides),
such as c- xxxd2203xxx , c-glisamuride, and c- xxxd2215xxx , for ppar␥ activity. these compounds are not yet
synthesized. one recent publication, however, described a
n-acylsulfonamide, fk614, as both an insulin sensitizer
and ppar␥ activator (minoura et al., 2004). when subjected to our docking procedure, fk614 was assigned a pki
value of 6.4.
as illustrated in fig. 6, common properties of carboxylic
acids (1) and thiazolidinediones (2), the major ppar␥ ligand classes at present, are their acidity and the hydrogen
bond acceptor potential of their deprotonated forms. according to x-ray analyses of ppar␥-ligand complexes,
