background & aims: irritable bowel syndrome (ibs) is
a functional disorder with an etiology that has been
linked to both psychological stress and infection. the
primary aim of this study was to examine the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis in patients with ibs
and to relate such response to plasma cytokine proﬁles. methods: a total of 151 subjects, 76 patients
and 75 controls, were recruited. the patients with ibs
were diagnosed according to rome ii criteria. fortynine patients and 48 matched controls had cytokine
levels measured, and a subset of 21 patients and 21
controls also underwent a  xxxg517xxx  (crh) stimulation test with plasma levels of
 xxxg1801xxx  (acth) and cortisol
measured. the remaining 27 patients and 27 controls
underwent a dexamethasone (1 mg) challenge.
results: cortisol and the proinﬂammatory cytokines
interleukin (il)-6 (together with its soluble receptor)
and il-8 were elevated in all ibs subgroups (diarrhea
predominant, constipated, and alternators), although
the elevation was most marked in the constipated
subgroup. there was no alteration in the anti-inﬂammatory cytokine il-10. following crh infusion, an
exaggerated release of both acth and cortisol was
observed in patients with ibs. there was a signiﬁcant
correlation between the acth response (␦acth) and
the il-6 levels. a similar relationship existed between
the ␦acth/␦cortisol ratio and the il-6 levels. dexamethasone suppression of cortisol was similar in patients and controls. conclusions: ibs is characterized
by an overactivation of the hypothalamic-pituitaryadrenal axis and a proinﬂammatory cytokine increase.

rritable bowel syndrome (ibs) is a highly prevalent
functional disorder of the gastrointestinal tract characterized by the presence of abdominal pain or discomfort, an alteration in bowel habit, and the absence of

reliable biomarkers.1–3 it can result in significant impairment in social and psychological function with an associated impairment in quality of life. the latter occurs to
an extent seen with major organic diseases such as hypertension and diabetes.4,5 the precise pathophysiology
of ibs remains to be elucidated. while gut dysmotility
and altered visceral perception are considered important
contributors to symptom pathogenesis,6,7 this condition
is now generally viewed as a disorder of the brain-gut
axis. recently, roles for enteric infection and intestinal
inflammation have also been proposed. studies have documented the onset of ibs following bacteriologically
confirmed gastroenteritis, while others have provided
evidence of low-grade mucosal inflammation8 –10 and immune activation11,12 in ibs. the enteric flora has also
been implicated, and in a recent placebo-controlled study
we demonstrated the efficacy of the probiotic organism
bifidobacterium in treating the disorder through a modulation of immune activity.13
the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (hpa) is the
core endocrine stress system in humans14 and provides an
important link between the brain and the gut immune
system. activation of the axis takes place in response to
both physical and psychological stressors,15 both of
which have been implicated in the pathophysiology of
ibs.10 patients with ibs are reported as having an increased rate of sexual and physical abuse in childhood
together with high rates of stressful life events in adulthood.16 such psychosocial trauma or poor cognitive coping strategy profoundly affects symptom severity, daily
functioning, and health outcome. it is inappropriate to
attempt to determine whether physiologic or psychological factors cause pain or other bowel symptoms.17 the

manner in which the hpa responds to stress, both
physical and psychological, may have significant implications for the emergence and maintenance of symptoms
and play a key role in any biopsychosocial explanation of
the disorder.18  xxxg517xxx  (crh),
produced in the parvicellular neurons of the paraventricular nucleus, is the primary hypothalamic regulatory
peptide.19,20 in response to psychological stress, its release is controlled by classic central neurotransmitters
such as norepinephrine and 5-ht21; in response to infection, crh-containing neurons respond to proinflammatory cytokines such as interleukin (il)-1, il-6, and
 xxxg2296xxx  (tnf)-␣.22,23 thus, the hpa-gut
circuit represents an important regulatory loop linking
the brain and gut. activation of the hpa results in
increased glucocorticoid secretion from the adrenal cortex, resulting in multiple effects, including suppression
of inflammatory processes in the gut. in turn, proinflammatory cytokines from the gut directly impact on the
hypothalamus and monoaminergic networks in the
brain.24 –27 it can therefore be seen that humoral crosstalk between the brain and gut may well be as important
as neurally mediated interactions in situations of stress
such as gastrointestinal infection and inflammation. indeed, evidence exists for both hpa dysfunction and
mucosal inflammation in ibs.
with regard to the hpa, fukudo et al28 examined
acth release following intravenous challenge with
crh both in patients with ibs and matched healthy
controls. they found an exaggerated response in the
patient group, which was accompanied by an increased
intestinal response to crh. the reason for the increased
acth response to crh is not clear. inflammation cannot be directly implicated because no mucosal biopsy
specimens were taken. however, in a related study of 77
patients, none of whom had a confirmed infectious origin
for their ibs, chadwick et al29 did study colonic biopsy
specimens and found that 31 had demonstrated microscopic inflammation and 8 fulfilled criteria for lymphocytic colitis. even those with “normal” histology showed
increased intraepithelial lymphocytes. in a study of patients with severe ibs, tornblom et al30 found inflammation extending beyond the mucosa, with infiltration
of lymphocytes in the myenteric plexus. peripheral inflammation is know to activate the hpa31 and may
account for the exaggerated hpa responses reported by
fukudo et al.28 despite the considerable interest that
now exists in the potential role of infective and/or inflammatory triggers in ibs and other functional disorders, interactivity between mucosal inflammation, on the
one hand, and the hpa, on the other, has not been
explored in these disorders.

in this study, we investigated plasma cytokine levels
and hpa response to crh infusion, thus examining 2
key components of the hpa-gut circuit. we measured
unstimulated basal plasma cytokine levels rather than
stimulated whole blood or peripheral blood mononuclear
cells because the free plasma cytokine component is the
biologically active humoral element that produces effects
at the level of the paraventricular nucleus.32 we also
investigated glucocorticoid responses by examining negative feedback in the hpa as assessed by a dexamethasone challenge. the study is based on the hypothesis that
ibs is an inflammatory disorder sustained by hpa dysregulation.

patients and methods
study population
patients were recruited from gastroenterology clinics
at st james’s hospital (dublin, ireland). individuals aged
between 18 and 55 years who satisfied rome ii criteria for the
diagnosis of ibs3 and in whom organic gastrointestinal diseases, including inflammatory bowel disease, and clinically
significant systemic diseases had been excluded were considered for inclusion in the study. pregnant women, individuals
with known lactose intolerance or immunodeficiency, and
individuals who had undergone any abdominal surgery, with
the exception of hernia repair and appendectomy, were excluded, as were patients with a formal psychiatric illness. no
attempt was made to select patients with ibs on the basis of
either sex or predominant bowel habit.

trial protocol
a total of 151 subjects, 76 patients with ibs (50
women and 26 men) and 75 healthy, age- and sex-matched
comparison subjects, gave fully informed consent to take part
in this study, which had ethics committee approval. the age
(mean ⫾ sd) of the patients was 34.6 ⫾ 13.1 years and of the
comparison group was 30.2 ⫾ 13.5 years (table 1). all were
within 10% of ideal body weight. of the 151 subjects, 49
patients and 48 controls had cytokine levels measured, and a
subset of 21 patients and 21 age- and sex-matched controls
also underwent a crh stimulation test. the remaining 27
patients and 27 controls underwent a dexamethasone (1 mg)
challenge. the inclusion and exclusion criteria used in each
component of the study were identical. the decision to restrict
the crh test to 21 patients and 21 controls was based on a
power calculation aimed at detecting differences at the .05
level. for practical reasons (work and family commitments),
some patients were happy to provide blood for cytokine measures but were reluctant to undergo a time-consuming endocrine test.
each potentially eligible patient was evaluated by a full
review of clinical history, physical examination, and full blood
count and routine biochemistry analysis. clinically significant
abnormalities in any of the latter tests led to exclusion from

the study. each subject underwent a mental state examination
to out rule the presence of dsm-iv major depression, anxiety
disorder, or other significant psychiatric illness.
the following 3 core ibs symptom clusters were assessed:
abdominal pain or discomfort, bloating or distention, and
bowel movement difficulty. each symptom was evaluated using a 10-cm visual analogue scale (maximum score, 10).33 a
composite score with a maximum of 30 was calculated for each
patient. the gastrointestinal symptom rating scale was completed for each subject.34
all premenopausal female subjects were evaluated in the
early follicular phase of the menstrual cycle (within 7 days of
commencing menstruation). all patients and healthy comparison subjects were drug free.
following a fast from 10 am, an indwelling forearm cannula
was inserted at 12:30 pm and the subject remained in a supine
position for the duration of the test. at 1 pm (0 min), ovine
crh (1 ␮g/kg) was injected intravenously over 60 seconds.
blood was taken for estimation of plasma adrenocorticotropic
hormone (acth) and serum cortisol levels at ⫺15, 0, 15, 30,
45, 60, 90, and 120 minutes. those subjects not undergoing
a crh test had blood sampled for cytokine measures between
12 pm and 1 pm. the dexamethasone (1 mg) challenge was
conducted as previously described.35,36 dexamethasone 1 mg
was given at 11 pm and a blood sample for estimation of
cortisol level was drawn at 3:30 pm the following afternoon. a
cortisol level ⬎137 nmol/l was defined as nonsuppression.
plasma cortisol level was measured by an unextracted, nonchromatographic radioimmunoassay. the coefficient of variation at both 100 nmol/l and 1000 nmol/l was 6%. plasma
acth level was measured using a 2-site unextracted immunoradiometric assay with a commercially available kit supplied
by the nichols institute (san juan capistrano, ca). the
sensitivity of the assay was 5 ng/l. intra-assay and interassay
coefficients of variation were 3% and 6%, respectively.

six milliliters of whole blood was collected (before
crh administration in those who underwent the endocrine
challenge test) in edta tubes. samples were centrifuged
immediately and serum frozen at ⫺36°c. il-6, il-8, il-10,
sil-6r, and tnf-␣ were measured in duplicate by enzymelinked immunosorbent assay (elisa). the dynamic range of
the il-6 assay varies between 0.16 and 10.0 pg/ml with an
intra-assay coefficient of variation of 8.33% and an interassay
coefficient of variation of 10.00% at the 2.0-pg/ml level.
sil-6r was quantified with a sandwich elisa (biosource,
camarillo, ca) based on a monoclonal-monoclonal antibody
pair and a biotin-streptavidin amplification system. the dynamic range of the immunoassay varies between 62.5 and 4000
pg/ml with an intra-assay coefficient of variation of 5.0% and
an interassay coefficient of variation of 5.6% at the 300-pg/ml
level. il-8 was quantified with a sandwich elisa (biosource)
based on a monoclonal-monoclonal antibody pair and a biotinstreptavidin amplification system. the dynamic range of the
immunoassay varies between 0.39 and 25.0 pg/ml with an
intra-assay coefficient of variation of 4.1% and an interassay
coefficient of variation of 6.2% at the 6.0-pg/ml level. il-10
was also quantified with a sandwich elisa (biosource), the
dynamic range of which varies between 0.78 and 50.0 pg/ml
with an intra-assay coefficient of variation of 4.5% and an
interassay coefficient of variation of 7.8% at the 4.2-pg/ml
level. the range of the tnf-␣ assay varies between 0.5 and
32.0 pg/ml with an intra-assay coefficient of variation of 6.7%
and an interassay coefficient of variation of 8.2% at the 6.1pg/ml level.

statistics
a 2-way repeated-measures analysis of variance was
used to examine differences in response between patients and
controls. response (␦) was also measured as the difference
between baseline level and the maximum level following administration of ovine crh for both acth and cortisol.
two-tailed student t tests were used to compare acth and
cortisol responses in patients and comparison subjects and also
to compare baseline cytokine measures. an analysis of covariance was used to determine the impact of cytokine measures on
hpa response. a pearson product-moment correlation coefficient was used as appropriate. results are expressed as mean ⫾
sem.

results
baseline characteristics
classification of subjects at baseline by predominant symptom indicated that 30 were alternators, 36
diarrhea predominant, and 10 constipation predominant.
patients and control subjects were well matched in terms
of alcohol use; however, 18 of the patients were cigarette
smokers, whereas only 8 healthy controls smoked.

discussion
our results indicate that patients with ibs have
an exaggerated stress response, as evidenced by the enhanced release of both acth and cortisol following
crh infusion. such patients also showed increased levels
of the proinflammatory cytokines il-6 and il-8. the
former is known to be a potent activator of the hpa, and
our analysis suggests that the hpa hyperresponsivity is
related to elevation of il-6 levels. we measured free
plasma cytokine levels because these will reflect the
biologic activity of the cytokines at a hypothalamic level.
although ibs is regarded as a functional bowel disorder, it is clear that the hpa responses seen in the
condition are different from those observed in psychiatric
illnesses such as depression. it is well established that
patients with major depression have a blunted release of
acth in response to crh infusion and a normal cortisol response.37,38 this is generally interpreted as indicating a down-regulation of the  xxxg517xxx  receptor on the
anterior pituitary brought about by increased production
of crh. the latter fact is supported by the increased
crh-like immunoreactivity seen in the cerebrospinal
fluid in depressed patients.39 depression was an exclusion
criterion in our study, and the acth responses we
observed in ibs are directly opposite of those described
in depression and other mood disorders. this indicates
that while ibs falls within the spectrum of functional
disorders, it does not share a core biologic marker associated with mood disorders. this observation is in agreement with the finding that for patients with ibs taken as
a whole, there is no evidence of an increase in prevalence
of major psychiatric disorders.40 indeed, depression and
anxiety are now viewed not as causes of ibs but rather as
comorbid factors that may influence an individual’s response to ibs symptoms and act as confounders in clinical studies. a failure to screen ibs-affected patients with
depression, especially likely in a tertiary referral center,
may explain the conflicting findings. bohmelt et al41 in
a small study reported attenuated acth and cortisol
responses in ibs, and their results more closely resemble
those seen in major depression than those obtained by us
or those of posserud et al.42 the latter used mental stress
as the mechanism for hpa activation and found that
patients with ibs release more acth than healthy
controls. using a different form of mild psychological
stress, dickhaus et al43 found altered perceptual response
to balloon distention but no difference between patients
and controls on measures such as acth and cortisol.
the exaggerated acth release following crh infusion in ibs may be due to a number of factors. firstly,
exogenous crh may act synergistically with the in-

irritable bowel syndrome and stress hormones

309

creased proinflammatory cytokines in bringing about
acth release. secondly, and alternately, the  xxxg517xxx 
receptor on the anterior pituitary may be up-regulated in
ibs. there is evidence to suggest from motility studies
that a similar increased sensitivity or up-regulation of
 xxxg517xxx  takes place at the level of the gut as a result of
stress.28,44 if this is the case, the use of  xxxg517xxx  antagonists
in the treatment of ibs is worthy of further exploration.
thirdly, there may be an increase in other secretogogues,
which act additively or synergistically with crh. in this
regard, the importance of vasopressin as a regulator of the
hpa in situations of stress (either infection or psychological) is well established.45,46 the current results lend
greatest support for the first hypothesis.
the combination of high basal cortisol levels and
exaggerated hpa responses in the face of elevated levels
of proinflammatory cytokines could be taken to indicate
a decreased sensitivity at the level of the glucocorticoid
receptor. to explore this possibility, we examined hpa
response to dexamethasone challenge. this response, mediated by the  xxxg1601xxx , was found to be
similar in patients and controls. it is therefore unlikely
that the proinflammatory cytokine profile and overactive
hpa are due to decreased responsivity at the level of the
 xxxg1601xxx . previous studies have found a
high correlation between glucocorticoid hpa feedback
and  xxxg1601xxx  messenger rna expression
in lymphocytes.36 our findings are best explained in
terms of a sustained stressor rather than a defect in
glucocorticoid suppression or negative feedback. because
both cortisol and cytokine levels fluctuate throughout
the day, future studies should include sampling over
longer periods.
in a recent study, we showed superiority for a probiotic bifidobacterium over both a lactobacillus and placebo for each of the cardinal symptoms of ibs.13 we
found a cytokine ratio in peripheral blood mononuclear
cells skewed toward a th1 proinflammatory profile and
symptomatic improvement was associated with a normalization of the il-10/il-12 ratio. elsenbruch et al47
conducted the first study to provide evidence that peripheral immune function might be altered in ibs. they
stimulated whole blood with lipopolysaccharide and
measured both tnf-␣ and il-6 levels; patients failed to
show a postprandial decrease in the in vitro tnf-␣
production observed in controls. while we also found a
proinflammatory profile in ibs, our plasma tnf-␣ levels
were similar in patients and controls. these apparent
contradictions may be due to differences in methodology.
we measured free cytokine levels in plasma using
ultrasensitive kits, because this cytokine component is
the most relevant when exploring the central effects of

310

dinan et al

cytokines on the hypothalamus. it is not currently possible to measure plasma il-12 levels in unstimulated
blood, and hence we have no such measures in the
present study. however, the results provide further support for the view that ibs is associated with a proinflammatory response and that effective therapy should be
capable of modulating such a profile. the elevation in
il-6 level was similar in all subgroups of ibs, but while
il-8 level was elevated in all 3 groups, the greatest
elevation was seen in the constipation-predominant subgroup (n ⫽ 8). this finding should be viewed cautiously
given the small sample size. future studies should prospectively assess cytokine profiles in conjunction with the
development and remission of symptoms. it is unclear
from the present study whether cytokine alterations are
state or trait markers.
support for the view that hyperactivity of the hpa
might initiate or sustain ibs is provided by studies in a
recently described animal model of ibs and is consistent
with proposed biopsychosocial views of the syndrome.16
the neonatal maternal deprivation model is known to
trigger long-term alterations in gut transit time, colonic
epithelial barrier function, and mucosal immunity in the
rat.48 the core biologic alteration in these animals is
increased hpa activity with high levels of corticosterone49 and increased production of proinflammatory cytokines. these endocrine and immune alterations are
similar to those observed in our patients. however, it is
possible that the immune alterations detected in our
patients are related to factors other than hpa disturbance. for example, several studies indicate sympathoadrenal medullary axis alterations in ibs, with patients
showing high basal norepinephrine levels42 and greater
than normal postprandial increases.41 our finding of
increased proinflammatory cytokines may be a result of
exaggerated sympathoadrenal medullary axis responses.
the present study has a number of limitations. to
start, the sample size recruited for the crh study was
based on a power calculation determined to detect differences in the endocrine responses but is inadequate to
explore the biology of different symptom subgroups. the
study was not placebo controlled. in general, acth
response to placebo is negligible and a placebo control in
such studies is not considered necessary.46 furthermore,
the study protocol did not include mucosal biopsy specimens, which would have enabled an examination of the
relationship between colonic mucosal histology/immune
activation with the plasma cytokine levels. the protocol
also did not include a measurement of chronic stressors or
life events.
in summary, patients with ibs were found to have
increased acth and cortisol response to crh infusion

gastroenterology vol. 130, no. 2

and a heightened level of the proinflammatory cytokines
il-6, its soluble receptor, and il-8 in the presence of
high basal cortisol levels but normal dexamethasone
suppression. the data provide evidence to support the
view that ibs is characterized by a proinflammatory
cytokine response and an exaggerated activation of the
hpa. the elevation in proinflammatory cytokines may
be centrally driven, as in the case of other biopsychosocial
disorders.50 the cytokine alterations described are worthy of exploration as a potential biomarker, and future
studies should focus on the factors that drive the elevation.
