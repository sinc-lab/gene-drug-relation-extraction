preclinical studies with  xxxd2029xxx  (tarceva).   xxxd2029xxx  hcl (tarceva; genentech, inc, south san francisco, ca) is an orally available, highly selective, reversible inhibitor of  xxxg682xxx  ( xxxg682xxx /egfr)  xxxg2198xxx . inhibition of  xxxg2198xxx  activity prevents  xxxg682xxx /egfr phosphorylation, the associated downstream signaling events, and may block tumorigenesis mediated by inappropriate  xxxg682xxx /egfr signaling. in vitro and in vivo studies show that  xxxd2029xxx  has activity against human colorectal, head and neck, non-small cell lung, and pancreatic tumor cells. recent preclinical studies suggest that  xxxd2029xxx  may also have activity against tumors that are dependent on her2 activation for growth and/or survival. preclinical studies have addressed the feasibility of using  xxxd2029xxx  in combination with various chemotherapeutic agents, radiotherapy, and targeted agents. combining agents that have different mechanisms of action has the potential to improve efficacy and inhibit the development of resistance. for example, in preclinical studies, combining  xxxd2029xxx  with cisplatin, doxorubicin, gemcitabine, or low-dose paclitaxel has an additive effect on antitumor activity with no increase in toxicity. preclinical data provide a strong rationale for investigating  xxxd2029xxx  in the clinical setting. however, additional studies are required to gain further insights into the processes that regulate or influence the antitumor activity of  xxxd2029xxx .
