stadtman, 1975). the functions of  xxxd2300xxx  and cyanocobalamin have not been
established.
vitamin b12 is transported in plasma on
specific carrier proteins designated transcobalamins (tc). one of these proteins, transcobalamin 11, is involved in intravascular transport of
vitamin b12and in the entry of vitamin b12into
the cells (allen, 1975,1976; mahoney & rosenberg, 1975), and absence of this protein is
characterized by a life-threatening illness
(hakami, neiman, canellos & lazeron, 1971 ;
scott, hakami, teng & sagerson, 1972;
hitzig, dohman, pluss & vischer, 1974). in
contrast the absence of the other carrier proteins in serum shows only as a iow serum
vitamin bizconcentration and does not imperil
life (carmel & herbert, 1969).
only a small proportion of the vitamin b12in
plasma is bound to tcii (hall, 1969; benson,
rapazzo & hall, 1972; burger, mehlman &
allen, 1975; england, down, wise & linnell,
1976) but tcii mediates 33-99% of the total
plasma vitamin bi2 clearance and 99% of the
clearance to cells other than hepatocytes (allen,
1976). the forms of vitamin biz which are
normally transported on this vitally important
protein have not been determined, however, and
this point was therefore investigated.

1. the transcobalamins from normal serum
were obtained in two fractions. one contained
 xxxg2255xxx  and transcobalamin i11: the
other contained transcobalamin 11. the forms
of  xxxd2716xxx  i z in the two fractions were then
examined.
2. methylcobalamin and adenosylcobalamin
were found in both fractions.  xxxd2300xxx  was found in the fraction containing  xxxg2255xxx  and transcobalamin 111. cyanocobalamin was found in both fractions in two
cases, in the transcobalamin 111fraction only in
one case and was absent in one case.

introduction
four forms of vitamin b12 are normally present
in human serum. methylcobalamin is the predominant form. adenosylcobalamin and  xxxd2300xxx  account jointly for an average
of 33% and cyanocobalamin for an average of
2% (linnell, hoffbrand, hussein, wise &
matthews, 1974). two of these forms have
established biochemical functions: methylcobalamin in the synthesis of homocysteine from
methionine and adenosylcobalamin in the isomerization of methylmalonyl  xxxd1739xxx  to
succinyl  xxxd1739xxx  (babior, 1975; poston &

materials and methods
samples of venous blood were obtained from
four normal subjects by clean venepuncture with
foil-wrapped syringes and transferred to foil-

wrapped glass tubes in a darkroom illuminated
by two ilford safelights fitted with 15 w bulbs
and f904 dark-brown filters. after clotting, the
samples were centrifuged and the serum was
removed in the darkroom and stored at -20°c
in foil-wrapped glass tubes.
preparation of the transcobalamin fractions
and extraction and separation of cobalamins
were all carried out under darkroom conditions.
serum was fractionated on a k26/70 column
(pharmacia ltd) containing sephadex g-200
(pharmacia ltd) with a bed volume of 300 ml
and a bed height of 56 cm by upward elution
with degassed tris/hci buffer, ph 8.0, at a flow
rate of 15 ml/h maintained by a persistaltic pump
(12000 varioperpex lkb ltd). the eluent was
collected continuously in 6 ml fractions in an
ultrorac fraction collector (lkb ltd). before
separation of the test samples, the column was
calibrated with 4 ml volumes of serum containing [57co]cyanocobalamin and the eluent volumes of the two transcobalamin fractions were
ascertained. the test samples were applied to
the column in volumes of 4 ml and the appropriate eluent fractions were pooled to give two
fractions, one containing tcii-vitamin b1 and
the other containing the other (tci and tciii)
tc-vitamin b1 complexes. the pooled fractions were stored in foil-wrapped glass containers
at -20°c until dialysis in cuphrophan tubing
against distilled water for 15 h to remove buffer
salts.
the vitamin b12in the dialysed fractions was
extracted into a concentrated aqueous extract by
the method described by farquharson & a d a m
(1976) and the forms of  xxxd2716xxx  i 2 were
separated by thin-layer chromatography in the
dark by using silica gel sheets (eastman

chromogram sheets no. 6061) with a solvent
system of butan-2-ol/ xxxd3026xxx /water/ammonia,
7:4:3:1,by vol.
the identification of the separated forms was
effected in daylight by the bioautographic
method described by linnell, mackenzie,
wilson & matthews (1969); the growth zones
from the test sample were identified by their
position relative to standards of methylcobalamin, adenosylcobalamin, hydroxocobalmin
and cyanocobalamin. the amounts of each form
of  xxxd2716xxx  i 2in the extracts were estimated by
comparing the size of the growth zones obtained
from the extracts with those yielded by the
standards which had been applied in known
amounts. account was also taken of the effect of
the diluting and concentrating procedures and
the amount of each form of vitamin bizin the
extract was finally expressed as a percentage of
the total in both extracts.
results
the results are shown in detail in table 1. the
expression of results in the form used implies a
degree of precision which is unrealistic in practice but was dictated by the disproportion in the
amounts of vitamin b12in the two tc fractions.
this does not affect the essential features of the
results which are that methylcobalamin and
adenosylcobalamin were present in both tc
fractions in all cases, that  xxxd2300xxx 
was present in all the samples but never in the
tcii-vitamin  xxxd2237xxx  fractions, and that cyanocobalamin was found in three samples, being
present in both t c fractions in two samples and
in the tcii-vitamin biz fraction only in the
third.

forms of b i zon transcobalamitu

the predominant form of vitamin  xxxd2237xxx  was
methylcobalamin, which accounted for 39-62%
(average 54%), adenosylcobalamin accounting
for 22-39% (average 32%),  xxxd2300xxx 
for 8-15% (average 10%) and cyanocobalamin
for up to 12% (average 4%).
the ratios of methylcobalamin to adenosylcobalamin ranged from 0.5 to 1.0 for the tciivitamin b12fraction and from 1.0 to 3.7 for the
other tc-vitamin b12 fraction.
discussion
tcii and tciii participate in intravascular
transport of  xxxd2716xxx  i zand facilitate entry of
vitamin b12 into cells. the tcii-cyanocobalamin complex is cleared rapidly from plasma by
various tissues; shortly after cell uptake, the
tcii moiety is degraded and a significant fraction of the vitamin  xxxd2237xxx  in as yet unidentified
form leaves the cell and enters the plasma in the
free state. the tciii-cyanocobalamin complex
is also cleared rapidly but exclusively by the
liver; part of the complex is excreted in bile, and
the tciii moiety of the remainder is degraded
and the vitamin bi in unknown form is excreted
into plasma bound to tcii. the fate of the
tci- xxxd1771xxx  which is cleared
relatively slowly is not known (cooksley,
england, louis, down & tavill, 1974; burger,
schneider, mehlman & allen, 1975; nexo &
gimsing, 1975; allen, 1975, 1976; schneider,
burger, mehlman & allen, 1976).
leaving aside the unknown quantities of the
function of tci and the affinities of the tc for
the various forms of vitamin b12,the absence of
 xxxd2300xxx  from the tcii- xxxd2716xxx 
complex would therefore suggest that this form,
unlike the others which can enter all cells, can
enter only hepatocytes and is not excreted from
hepatocytes to plasma. such concepts, however,
leave open to question the origins of non-dietary
 xxxd2300xxx  in plasma and do not accord
with observations on the uptake of  xxxd2300xxx  by cells other than hepatocytes both
in uivo and in uitro (linnell, 1975). a more
interesting and acceptable concept is that tci
effects the cell entry and exit of  xxxd2300xxx  and is solely responsible for this function
in cells other than hepatocytes.
