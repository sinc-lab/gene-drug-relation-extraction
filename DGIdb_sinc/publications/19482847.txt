abstract
objective: inhibition of interleukin-1 activity improves
nitro-oxidative stress, endothelial and coronary function.
the authors investigated (a) the association of nitrooxidative stress and endothelial function with myocardial
deformation, (b) the effects of anakinra, an interleukin-1a
receptor antagonist on myocardial deformation in patients
with rheumatoid arthritis (ra).
methods: the authors compared 46 ra patients to 23
normal controls. 23 patients received anakinra (150 mg
subcutaneously once daily) and 23 patients a 5-mg
increase of prednisolone dose for 30 days. at baseline
and post-treatment this study assessed (a) the left
ventricular (lv) longitudinal, circumferential and radial
strain and strain rate, using speckle tracking echocardiography, (b) the coronary flow reserve (cfr), (c) the flowmediated endothelial-dependent dilation of the brachial
artery (fmd) and (d) nitrotyrosine (nt) and malondialdehyde blood levels.
results: patients had impaired baseline myocardial
deformation indices compared to controls (p,0.05). cfr
and nt levels were related to longitudinal strain, systolic
and diastolic strain rate, circumferential strain and systolic
strain rate (p,0.05). fmd was related to longitudinal and
circumferential diastolic strain rate (p,0.01). compared
to baseline, anakinra-treated patients increased the
longitudinal strain (217.8% (3.7%) vs 222.1% (3.5%)),
systolic (21.02 (0.23) l/s vs 21.25 (0.23) l/s) and
diastolic (0.96 (0.37) l/s vs 1.20 (0.39) l/s) longitudinal
strain rate, circumferential strain and strain rate (p,0.05
for all comparisons). no significant changes were
observed among prednisolone-treated patients
conclusions: myocardial deformation is impaired in ra
patients and is related to nitro-oxidative stress and
endothelial dysfunction. chronic inhibition of il-1 improves
lv deformation in parallel with endothelial function and
nitro-oxidative stress.

the inflammatory processes in patients with
rheumatoid arthritis (ra) are strongly linked to
an excess risk of cardiovascular disease and
mortality.1 in this process interleukin-1 (il-1)
activity may cause myocardial cell damage and
endothelial dysfunction leading to an impaired
coronary flow reserve (cfr).2 3 the adverse
effects of il-1 on myocardial and endothelial
cells are mediated by an enhanced nitro-oxidative
stress4 5 and production of other inflammatory
mediators.6–8
anakinra, a recombinant form of human il-1
receptor antagonist ( xxxg1172xxx ), is commonly used for
the treatment of ra.9 we have previously shown
1502

that treatment with anakinra reduces il-1mediated nitro-oxidative stress, leading to an
improvement in endothelial function (as expressed
by cfr and flow-mediated dilation of the brachial
artery (fmd)) as well as in tissue doppler-derived
parameters of left ventricular (lv) function.10
however, tissue doppler imaging (tdi) velocities
of the mitral annulus may offer information only
for the longitudinal component of lv function and
are angle and load dependent. conversely, speckle
tracking echocardiography is considered a reliable
method for the assessment of longitudinal, radial
and circumferential lv myocardial deformation
during systole and diastole11 and is angle and load
independent. studies have shown that lv myocardial systolic strain and long axis function are
impaired even in the presence of preserved ejection
fraction.12–14
in the present study, we hypothesised that
nitro-oxidative stress in ra patients affects
endothelial function, coronary microcirculation
and myocardial function leading to impaired lv
myocardial deformation. thus, we investigated (a)
whether lv myocardial deformation as assessed by
two-dimensional (2d) speckle tracking echocardiography11 is impaired in ra patients compared to
normal controls; (b) the association of endothelial
function (as assessed by fmd15 and cfr), markers
of nitro-oxidative stress (malondialdehyde and
nitrotyrosine) on lv myocardial deformation
parameters; and (c) the effects of chronic treatment with anakinra in comparison to the respective effects of treatment with corticosteroids on lv
myocardial deformation.

methods
study population and protocol
we examined 46 patients (mean age 56 (sd 16)
years, 31 females) with ra (american rheumatism
association criteria16) who had an inadequate
response to disease modifying antirheumatic drugs
(dmards) and corticosteroids. all patients were
on methotrexate 7.5 mg once per week, leflunamide 20 mg once daily and prednisolone 5 mg once
daily. none of our patients was being treated with
non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (nsaids)
within the past year. out of 46 ra patients four
(9%) were had been on stable treatment with
statins and 11 (24%) on stable treatment with
cardioactive medications for the past 6 months
(table 1). we used the following equation to
calculate the composite inflammatory disease
activity score (das), which utilises c-reactive

protein (crp), the visual analogue score (vas) of wellbeing and
the number of tender and swollen joints (from a total of 28
joints assessed): das = !(0.566number of tender joints) +
!(0.286number of swollen joints) + [0.706ln(crp)] +
(0.0146vas).17 to assess changes in physical activity at baseline
and after 30 days of treatment, we used the duke activity
status index (dasi). dasi is a brief, self-administered questionnaire designed to estimate patients’ ability to perform daily
activities and provides an estimation of exercise capacity
measured in metabolic equivalents (mets).18
of the 46 patients, a group of 23 patients (mean age 57 (sd
17) years, 17 females) received anakinra treatment (150 mg
subcutaneously once daily) for 30 days. a second group of 23
ra patients were selected on 1:1 basis to have similar baseline
age, sex and inflammatory disease activity as assessed by das
with the anakinra-treated group. the prednisolone-treated ra
patients also had an inadequate response to treatment with
dmards and prednisolone but were treated with an increase of
their initial dose of prednisolone by 5 mg for 30 days according
to standard clinical practice.10 patients were examined in the
outpatient clinic every 15 days to assess clinical status and crp.
to examine the patients’ compliance with therapy, we asked
these patients to provide the used ampoules of anakinra and the
used cartridges of prednisolone tablets at each visit.
none of the patients had cardiovascular or renal disease or
ischaemia during thallium scintigraphy or dobutamine stress.
patients with known or suspected coronary artery disease were
excluded to ensure that measurement of cfr would reflect the
status of coronary microcirculation and not the effects of
epicardial coronary artery stenosis. none of our patients had a
history of steroid induced diabetes.

twenty-three asymptomatic subjects of similar age and sex
as the ra patients and with a normal ecg, echocardiogram and
treadmill test were selected as healthy control subjects among
subjects attending the cardiology outpatient clinic.
both subgroups of ra patients had measurements of
biochemical, vascular and lv function markers at baseline and
after 30 days of treatment. the healthy control subjects had a
single baseline measurement of the examined markers.
the study protocol was approved by the institute’s ethics
committee, and written informed consents were obtained from
all patients.

echocardiography
studies were performed using a vivid 7 (ge medical systems,
horten, norway) ultrasound system. all studies were digitally
stored in a computerised station (echopac ge, horten, norway)
and were analysed by two observers blinded to clinical and
laboratory data. all patients had adequate images for analysis.

2d echocardiography
we measured the following parameters from cross-sectional
echocardiographic images of the left ventricle (lv): (1) enddiastolic (lvd), end-systolic diameter (lvs) (mm) and fractional shortening (fs) (%), and (2) ejection fraction (ef) (%)
using the simpson’s method of discs.

2d strain measurements
using a dedicated software package (echopac, ge medical
systems, horten, norway), two-dimensional strain was measured.11 19 apical four-chamber and parasternal midventricular

systemic disease and the heart
short-axis views of the lv were obtained at end-expiratory
apnoea and three cardiac cycles were stored from each view in
cineloop format for subsequent offline analysis. sectors were
adjusted to achieve frame rates >50 frames/s (50–82 frames/s).
by tracing the endocardiac contour from an end-diastolic frame
the software automatically tracked the contour on subsequent
frames. adequate tracking can be verified in real time and
corrected by adjusting the region of interest or manually
correcting the contour to ensure optimal tracking.11 19 mitral
and aortic valve opening and closure were defined by
anatomical m-mode. the average longitudinal (l), circumferential (c) and radial (r) peak systolic strain (s), as well as
longitudinal, circumferential and radial peak systolic, and early
diastolic strain rate (sr) were measured.11 17
the inter-observer and intra-observer variability for all
measurements were (8% and (10%, respectively.

coronary flow
coronary flow velocities in the left anterior descending
coronary artery were obtained with colour-guided pulse-wave
doppler from long-axis apical projections with a 7-mhz
transducer.10 the velocity time integral of the diastolic
component of coronary flow wave was measured at baseline
and after adenosine infusion (140 mg/kg/min) for 3 minutes and
the ratio of hyperaemic to resting measurement was used to
calculate the coronary flow reserve (cfr).10 measurements from
three cardiac cycles were averaged. all subjects abstained from
alcohol, caffeine and food for 8 hours and stopped taking any
vasoactive medications for 24 hours before the study. interobserver and intra-observer variability of these measurements
were 5% and 2%, respectively.

endothelial function
fmd and nitrate-induced vasodilatation of the brachial artery
were determined according to a previously published methodology.10 15 before the study, all subjects abstained from alcohol,
caffeine and food for 8 hours and stopped taking any vasoactive
medications for 24 hours. inter-observer and intra-observer
variability of the brachial artery diameter were 0.08 (0.19) mm
and 0.1 (0.12) mm, and the day-to-day variability of fmd was
1.1 (1)%.15

laboratory assays
 xxxg520xxx  (crp) was measured by a high-sensitivity
particle-enhanced immunonephelometry (dade behring,
marburg, germany, measurement range: 0.175–1100 mg/l).
malondialdehyde (mda) was determined spectrophotometrically using a commercial kit (oxford biomedical research
colorimetric assay for lipid peroxidation, measurement range:
1–20 nm), as previously described.10 elisa was used to
determine nitrotyrosine (nt) (hycult biotechnology bv,
uden, netherlands; measurement range 2–1500 nmol/l).

statistical analysis
to examine whether patients included in two treatment groups
(anakinra-treated and prednisone-treated) were adequately
balanced for the presence of atherosclerosis, we calculated the
logit propensity score in each patient. for this calculation, we
used a logistic regression model which included as dependent
variables age, sex, hypertension, hyperlipidaemia, smoking,
cardioactive medication, statins and baseline cfr and fmd as
markers related to atherosclerosis. propensity scores between
1504

anakinra-treated and prednisolone-treated patients were compared using a two-tailed t test.20
categorical data were compared between patients treated
with anakinra, prednisolone and normal controls by contingency tables (p value in table 1) and between each treatment
group and normal controls by the x2-test or fisher exact test
when five patients or fewer were included in each cell (table 1).
continuous variables were tested for normality using the
kolmogorov-smirnov test. normally distributed variables are
given as mean (sd). spearman correlation analysis was used to
determine bivariate correlations. because biomarkers had a nonnormal distribution, data are expressed as median (interquartile
range) and were analysed after transformation into ranks.21
analysis of variance (anova) (general linear model, spss
13) for repeated measurements was applied to compare the
effects of anakinra versus prednisolone, with measurements at
baseline and 30 days post-treatment used as a within-subject
factor and type of treatment as between-subject factor. the f
and p values of the interaction between time of measurement of
the examined markers and type of treatment were calculated.
the greenhouse-geisser correction was used when the sphericity assumption, as assessed by mauchly’s test, was not met.
post-hoc comparisons were performed with bonferroni’s correction.
comparisons between normal controls and each treatment
group at baseline or at 30 days were performed using the
unpaired t test (vascular and lv deformation indices) and
mann-whitney test (biomarkers), as well as the percentage
changes of the examined indices between baseline and 30 days
in the anakinra group versus changes in the prednisolone group.
statistical significance was considered as p,0.05.

results
patients and controls had similar age sex, body mass index
(bmi), atherosclerotic risk factors and medications, as well as
fs, ef and blood pressure (table 1). by logistic regression
analysis including age, sex, hypertension, hyperlipidaemia,
smoking, cardioactive medication, statins, baseline cfr and
fmd, the calculated logit propensity scores were similar
between the two treatment groups (0.195 (0.093) for anakinra-treated patients vs 0.180 (0.093), for prednisolone-treated
patients, p = 0.535). thus, the two groups were adequately
balanced for markers of atherosclerosis. twenty ra patients
complained of mild erythema at the injection site and none was
withdrawn from the study because of adverse effects or
inadequate response to treatment.
patients’ physical activity, as assessed by dasi, was similarly
improved in both treatment groups (from 3.9 (1.0) to 6.3 (1.1)
mets, post-anakinra and from 4.1 (1.2) to 5.9 (0.9) mets, postprednisolone, f for interaction with treatment = 3.4, p = 0.07).
at baseline, the dasi (mets) was related to das
(r = 20.454, p = 0.004) and crp levels (r = 20.510, p = 0.001).
furthermore, the percentage improvement in physical activity
as assessed by dasi, was related to the percentage improvement of das (r = 20.612, p,0.001). no other significant
associations between changes in physical activity and changes
in vascular or biochemical parameters were observed.

inter-relations between 2d speckle tracking parameters,
biochemical markers and vascular function indices at baseline
at baseline, cfr was associated with longitudinal strain
(r = 0.436, p = 0.013), longitudinal systolic strain rate
(r = 0.487, p = 0.005) and longitudinal early diastolic strain rate

treatment groups had similar age, sex, bmi, atherosclerotic risk

compared to baseline, there was an improvement in longitudinal strain, systolic and early diastolic strain rate, as well as
circumferential strain and systolic strain rate and radial strain
after 30 days of anakinra treatment (p,0.05 for all comparisons, table 3). in the prednisolone-treated group, there were no
statistically significant changes after treatment compared to
baseline. conversely, longitudinal strain, systolic and early
diastolic strain rate, as well as circumferential strain and systolic
strain rate were higher in patients after anakinra treatment than
after prednisolone treatment (p,0.05 for all comparisons).

discussion
2d speckle tracking derived parameters in patients versus
controls
at baseline, patients with ra had impaired longitudinal and
circumferential strain and systolic strain rate, compared to
controls, as well as radial strain (p,0.05, table 2). furthermore,
longitudinal and circumferential early diastolic strain rate
modestly deteriorated in patients versus controls (p = 0.04 and
p = 0.045, table 2). radial systolic and early diastolic strain rate
was similar between ra patients and controls.

2d-speckle tracking derived parameters post-anakinra versus
post-prednisolone
baseline 2d-speckle tracking parameters were similar between
the two treatment groups (table 3). additionally the two

to our knowledge, this is the first study to report a significant
deterioration in longitudinal and circumferential strain and
systolic strain rate in ra patients with preserved ef compared
to healthy controls. these findings suggest that lv systolic
deformation at longitudinal and circumferential directions is
impaired, despite the presence of normal ef in rheumatoid
arthritis patients without overt heart failure. furthermore, in
the present study we have shown that endothelial function, as
assessed by fmd and cfr, and nitro-oxidative stress, as
assessed by nt and mda, are related to lv myocardial
deformation in ra patients. finally, in our study lv myocardial
deformation improved to a greater extent after chronic
inhibition of il-1 activity by anakinra than after treatment
with corticosteroids.

systemic disease and the heart
studies have shown an impaired coronary microcirculatory
function, as assessed by cfr, in patients with ra,10 22
ankylosing spondylitis23 and behçet’s disease.24 myocardial
microcirculatory dysfunction in ra is attributed to inflammation and enhanced nitro-oxidative stress10 25 and is improved by
treatment with anti- xxxg2296xxx  a (anti- xxxg2296xxx ) 25 or
interleukin-1ra.10 the impairment of coronary microcirculation
may compromise myocardial perfusion, and thus causes lv
systolic and diastolic dysfunction. in the present study, we
demonstrated that coronary microcirculatory function as
expressed by cfr was related to longitudinal and circumferential systolic and diastolic deformation parameters. also,
endothelial function as estimated by fmd was related to
circumferential and longitudinal diastolic deformation. thus,
the impairment of myocardial deformation in ra patients
compared to controls, as observed in our study, may be a result
of the endothelial and coronary microcirculatory dysfunction
characterising these patients.
however, previous studies suggest that myocardial cell
function is impaired10 26 in ra. pathological processes contributing to myocardial dysfunction in ra include increased
oxidative4 and nitrosative5 27 stress, production of il-1 and  xxxg1181xxx .6–8 21 26 products of nitro-oxidative stress and inflammatory
cytokines have a direct negative inotropic action.10 21 26
additionally, interstitial fibrosis caused by cytokine-induced
fibroblast activity and collagen deposition in the heart muscle
are present in ra28 and thus may play a part in the abnormal
myocardial deformation observed in our study. in support of
this hypothesis, we observed that nitro-oxidative stress as
expressed by nt and mda levels was related to longitudinal
systolic and/or diastolic deformation parameters at baseline.
thus, the inflammatory process and enhanced nitro-oxidative
stress may have a direct effect on myocardial function and,
therefore, may explain the impairment of longitudinal and
circumferential myocardial deformation at systole and early
diastole in the present study.
adenosine-induced cfr is endothelial dependent.29 il-1
enhances the production of  xxxg520xxx  (crp)6–8 and
inflammatory cytokines with negative inotropic action.8 10 21
furthermore, il-1 promotes the release of superoxide anion,2 10
contributing to an enhanced nitro-oxidative stress. through the
above mechanisms, il-1 impairs vascular reactivity, endothelial
function and coronary flow2 3 and contributes to myocardial
dysfunction. in our previous study,10 we have shown that
administration of anakinra, an  xxxd2806xxx , reduced
il-6 and nitro-oxidative stress with a parallel improvement of
fmd and cfr after acute and chronic treatment. the reduction
of nitro-oxidative stress demonstrated the highest correlation
with improvement of endothelial and coronary function.
in the present study we have extended our previous findings,
as we have now shown an improvement in longitudinal and
circumferential myocardial deformation after 30 days of treatment with anakinra in ra patients. furthermore, the improvement of these parameters was greater in the anakinra group
than in the prednisolone group after chronic treatment. this
improvement in myocardial deformation after anakinra administration is in parallel with the improvement in nt, mda, fmd
and cfr after anakinra treatment reported in our previous
study. these findings suggest that il-1 inhibition may improve
myocardial deformation to a greater extent than corticosteroids
because of a greater reduction of nitro-oxidative stress and
improvement in endothelial function. in our previous study,10 the
reduction of nitro-oxidative stress by anakinra caused normalisation of endothelial function and coronary microcirculatory
1506

function as assessed by cfr. thus, chronic treatment with
anakinra may increase myocardial perfusion and consequently
improve longitudinal and circumferential deformation, as
observed in the present study. furthermore, anakinra treatment
may contribute to the improvement in myocardial deformation
parameters by limiting the direct detrimental effects of nitrooxidative stress on myocardial cells. experimental studies have
demonstrated that anakinra treatment reduces the adverse cardiac
remodelling after myocardial infarction by inhibiting cell apoptosis.30 we may assume that, through these mechanisms, chronic
treatment with anakinra may improve lv myocardial deformation parameters in ra patients, as shown in the present study.

conclusions
in the present study we have shown a significant impairment of
myocardial deformation parameters of ra patients compared
with control group, in the presence of preserved ejection fraction.
the early detection of abnormalities in myocardial deformation
by speckle-tracking might provide a means of identifying patients
at risk for progressive heart failure and thus, may be important in
clinical practice when assessing the prognosis and optimising
treatment. moreover, administration of an  xxxd2806xxx  improves myocardial deformation in patients with rheumatoid arthritis, probably through the reduction of nitro-oxidative
stress and improvement in endothelial and coronary function.
anakinra treatment was more effective than corticosteroids in
improvement of lv deformation parameters.

study limitations
the study design does not permit us to explore the causality
between the changes of the vascular and lv function after
anakinra treatment. as ra patients with coronary artery
disease were excluded, the effects of anakinra in the presence
of coronary artery disease were not explored in our study.
improved physical activity after anakinra, as reflected by the
reduced das, may have contributed to the improvement in
biochemical, vascular and lv deformation parameters in our
study.31 the non-invasive assessment of endothelial function and
coronary flow should also be acknowledged as a limitation.14
