summary
as part of a more extensive investigation on structural features
of different low-molecular-weight heparins (lmwhs) that can
affect their biological activities, enoxaparin,  xxxd3379xxx  and  xxxd1805xxx  were characterised with regards to the distribution of
different chain length oligosaccharides as determined by size-exclusion (se) chromatography, as well as their structure as defined by 2d-nmr spectra (hsqc). the three lmwhs were
also fractionated into high affinity (ha) and no affinity (na)
pools with regards to their ability to bind antithrombin (at).the
ha fractions were further subfractionated and characterised.
for the parent lmwhs and selected fractions, molecular weight
parameters were measured using a se chromatographic system
with a triple detector (tda) to obtain absolute molecular
weights.the se chromatograms clearly indicate that enoxaparin
is consistently richer in shorter oligosaccharides than  xxxd3379xxx 

and  xxxd1805xxx . besides providing the content of terminal
groups and individual glucosamine and uronic acid residues with
different sulfate substituents, the hsqc-nmr spectra permitted us to evaluate and correlate the content of the pentasaccharide, at-binding sequence a-g-a*-i-a (at-bs) through quantification of signals of the disaccharide sequence g-a*. whereas the percent content of ha species is approximately the same
for the three lmwhs, substantial differences were observed for
the chain distribution of at-bs as a function of length, with the
at-bs being preferentially contained in the longest chains of each
lmwh. the above information will be useful in establishing
structure-activity relationships currently under way.this study is
therefore critical for establishing correlations between structural features of lmwhs and their at-mediated anticoagulant
activity.

introduction
low-molecular-weight heparins (lmwhs), are a class of antithrombotic drugs derived from unfractionated heparin (ufh),
which have been introduced into clinical practice some 20 years
ago. their always increasing use in the treatment of thromboembolic and cardiovascular disorders is justified by a number of distinct advantages that these compounds offer over ufh. besides
minimisation of some unwanted side effects of ufh, such as
bleeding, thrombocytopenia (1) and osteoporosis, lmwhs also
exhibit a higher bioavailability, prolonged plasma half-life and a
more predictable pharmacological response (2–4), together with
a reduced anti-factor iia activity with respect to anti- xxxg741xxx 
activity (5–7).

heparin is a linear polymer made up of 1→4 linked disaccharide repeating units, consisting of a alpha- xxxd2211xxx  (a)
and a hexuronic acid, alpha-l-iduronic (i) or beta-d-glucuronic (g)
acid. variations within the disaccharide units occur especially in
the form of o-sulfation in position 2 of iduronic acid (i2s), and
position 3 and 6 of glucosamine (a3s, a6s) or in the form of
n-sulfation or n-acetylation at position 2 of the glucosamine
(ans, anac). this array of structural features generates a potential total of 48 different disaccharide combinations; however, not
all of these possible combinations are allowed by the biosynthetic process. different sulfation patterns are unevenly distributed along the heparin chain: the disaccharide sequence
–i2s–an,6s– is the major repeating structural unit and constitutes
the highly sulfated region within heparin and are primarily lo-

cated toward the non-reducing end of the heparin chains. conversely, undersulfated sequences containing nonsulfated iduronic acid residues and anac are prevalently located toward the
reducing end of the polymer (8). some of the heparin chains contain a specific pentasaccharide sequence, –anac,6s–g–ans,3s,6s–
i2s–ans,6s– (a-g-a*-i-a) constituting the antithrombin (at)
binding site (at-bs), characterised by a central rare trisulfated
glucosamine, ans,3s,6s (a*) (9–11).
ideally, lmwhs should differ from their parent heparins
only for their average molecular weight, which are approximately one third of that of the original ufh. in practice, depending on methods used for manufacturing lmwhs, lmwhs
differ from their parent heparin not only in terms of molecular
weight but also in terms of monosaccharide composition and oligosaccharide sequence. a number of strategies have been designed to obtain lmwhs, including size fractionation of heparin
to select lower molecular weight material and partial cleavage of
heparin chains through chemical or enzymatic processes. the
three most commonly used commercial lmwhs are produced
by different methods of depolymerisation, each resulting in
unique structural alterations at either the reducing and/or non-reducing end of the cleaved heparin chains (12, 13). enoxaparin is
the result of chemical beta-eliminative cleavage by alkaline treatment of heparin benzyl esters that generates delta4,5 uronic acid
residues at the non-reducing end. for this lmwh also the presence of 1,6-anhydro aminosugars at the reducing end has been
described (14).  xxxd3379xxx , prepared through enzymatic beta-eliminative cleavage of unmodified heparin by heparinase-i, is also
characterised by a unsaturated uronate residue present at the
non-reducing end of virtually every chain.  xxxd1805xxx  is produced through deaminative cleavage with nitrous acid followed
by reduction, resulting in formation of an anhydromannitol ring
at the reducing end.
besides the chemical nature of the terminal monosaccharide
residue, the internal structure of lmwhs differs from that of
parent heparins, depending on the cleavage point along the heparin chain. in particular, preferential cleavage at either highly
sulfated regions or the undersulfated ones influences disaccharide sequence distribution (i.e. monosaccharide composition and
substitution pattern) of resulting lmwhs. furthermore, the type
of depolymerisation can affect the preservation and location of
the specific pentasaccharide sequence aga*ia of the active site
for at (15, 16). previous studies have identified the fact that a
pentadecasaccharide with the antithrombin binding sequence located at the reducing end is optimal for bridging the at/fiia
complex (16). moreover, both the reducing and non-reducing extension of the pentasaccharide, together with possible structural
modifications inside the pentasaccharide itself, may sensibly influence the binding ability to at and consequently affect the biological activity of lmwhs (15, 18). functional assays performed in vitro, evaluating plasma protein binding and at-mediated
antiprotease activity, showed wide variations among the commercially available lmwhs, indicating that their compositional
differences have an important impact on biological activity (19).
with the aim of deepening the knowledge of structural features within lmwhs which may correlate with their biological
activities, the present work focuses on the investigation of the
composition of the three most common commercial lmwh,

enoxaparin,  xxxd3379xxx  and  xxxd1805xxx . each of them was characterised for its affinity to at and separated into high-affinity
(ha) and no-affinity (na) fractions. both fractions and the corresponding parent lmwhs were characterised for their molecular weight measured via hp-sec/tda (20), and for their monosaccharide composition evaluated by two-dimensional nuclear
magnetic resonance (2d-nmr) (21). each ha fraction was
further separated into three sub-fractions, with graded affinity
towards at. importantly, we find that the amount of a* is significantly increased in the ha fractions compared to either the parent lmwh or the na fraction as is the amount of the disaccharide g-a*, consistent with the known structure of the at-bs. furthermore, we find that this latter signature is a more reliable
marker of the pentasaccharide motif than a* alone. finally, comparison of enoxaparin,  xxxd3379xxx  and  xxxd1805xxx  to one another
indicated while there were some structural similarities, there
were also substantial molecular differences between the
samples.

materials and methods
materials
enoxaparin was supplied by sanofi-aventis pharma (milan,
italy) as injectable  xxxd1997xxx ;  xxxd3379xxx  was supplied by leopharma (ballerup, denmark) as a powder;  xxxd1805xxx  was from
pharmacia ab (stockholm, sweden) as injectable  xxxd1805xxx .
antithrombin was obtained from kybernin p1000 pharmaceutical preparation (zlb behring gmbh, marburg, germany).
size-exclusion chromatography
se chromatography was performed on bio-gel p10 column
(2.6 cm x 160 cm) as previously described (22).
affinity chromatography
two columns of different capacity were prepared for analytical
and preparative purposes. 10 mg of at were coupled to cyanogen
bromide (cnbr) activated sepharose 6 fast flow (pharmacia),
as described by hook et al. (23), to obtain an analytical column
(0.9 x 5.5 cm) of at-sepharose gel. following the same procedure, 100 mg of at was employed to set up a preparative column (1.6 x 10 cm). at was previously purified by ultrafiltration
with centricon ym p1000 (amicon) starting from kybernin
p1000 (zlb, behring gmbh, marburg, germany). preliminary
experiments to assess the maximum heparin binding capacity of
the at-sepharose column were carried out by loading different
amounts of enoxaparin. it was found that for amounts equal to or
lower than 2 mg and 15 mg respectively, the relative percentages
of interacting species were constant.
analytical affinity chromatography
of the samples, 1.5 mg were dissolved in 1.5 ml of equilibrium
buffer (tris-hcl 50 mm ph 7.4, nacl 50 mm) and loaded onto
the column (flow rate 0.5 ml/min). heparin chains with no affinity toward the antithrombin were eluted with 12 ml of equilibrium buffer and collected as a single fraction called na fraction.
heparin chains with high affinity toward the antithrombin were
eluted with 10 ml of elution buffer (tris-hcl 50 mm ph 7.4,
nacl 2.5 m) and collected as a single fraction named ha frac-

tion. the column was finally washed with 70 ml of equilibrium
buffer. all the effluent fractions from at-sepharose column were
analysed for uronic acid content by the carbazole reaction (24).
in each colorimetric assay, the calibration curve was built up
with an amount of the same lmwh solution loaded onto at-sepharose column.
subfractionation of ha fractions
to separate ha fractions into subfractions having graded affinity toward at, a preparative at-sepharose column was overloaded with an amount of lmwh (50 mg) corresponding to
three times the retention capacity of the resin. after a first chromatography, performed as described above, buffer at high ionic
strength eluted the first ha fraction, named  xxxd951xxx , whereas
buffer at lower ionic strength eluted a fraction composed by both
heparin chains devoid of affinity for at and chains exceeding the
retention capacity of the resin. this material was loaded again
onto the column and eluted under the same conditions as above:
ha2 and a second flow-through fraction were obtained. the reloading procedure was repeated twice again until no ha fraction
was retained by the column. a further ha fraction (ha3) and a
final fraction depleted of affinity for at (na), were obtained. all
the fractions were analysed for uronic acid content by the carbazole reaction. finally, fractions ha and na were desalted first
by ultrafiltration through amicon chamber (160 ml) with a 500
da cut off millipore filter, then by size exclusion chromatography with tsk-gel hw40s column (2.6 x 58 cm). to remove the traces of tris a cation-exchange chromatography was
finally performed on amberlite ir-120 [h+] column (2 x 12.5
cm). samples were neutralised with 0.1 n naoh.
molecular weight evaluation
molecular weight determinations were performed by hp-sectda on a viscotek (houston, texas) instrument equipped with a
ve1121 pump, rheodyne valve (100 µl), and triple detector
array 302 equipped with ri, viscometer, and light-scattering
(90° and 7°) systems. a g2500 and g3000 7.8mm x 30 cm tsk
gmpwxl tosoh columns were used with 0.1 m nano3 as
eluent (flow, 0.6 ml/min). samples were dissolved in the eluent
solution at 5 mg/ml. chromatogram analysis was performed
with omnisec 4,1 software, all molecular weight parameters
were obtained, number-average mean molecular weight (mn),
weight-average mean molecular weight (mw), and polydispersity (mw/mn, d), of each sample.
nmr spectra
spectra were recorded at 25°c on a bruker avance 600 spectrometer (karlsruhe, germany) equipped with 5-mm tci cryoprobe. in proton spectra water signal was presaturated during relaxation delay. samples were prepared by dissolution of 2–10 mg
of heparin in 0.6 ml of deuterium oxide. a recycle delay of 10
seconds and from 32 to128 number of scans were used, depending on the sample amount. two-dimensional heteronuclear
single quantum coherence (2d-hsqc) spectra were recorded
with carbon decoupling during acquisition with 320 increments
of 32–64 scans for each. the polarisation transfer delay (d = 1/[2
· 1jc–h]) was set with a 1jc–h coupling values of 150 hz. the matrix size 1k x 512 was zero filled to 4k x 2k by application of a

squared cosine function prior to fourier transformation. integration of peak volumes was made using standard bruker topspin 2.0 software. the monosaccharide composition was calculated following the procedure previously published (13). the
average degree of polymerisation (dp) is calculated through the
ratio between the total volume of anomeric signals (uronic acids,
glucosamines and lr residues) and that of anomeric signal residues at the reducing end (including the first galactose residue of
lr at 104.0/4.526 ppm) (25). mn is obtained by multiplying dp
value by the average mw of disaccharide (calculated by nmr
considering the average acetylation and sulfation degree).

results
size-homogeneous chromatographic fractions
the three lmwh preparations were separated into their oligomeric components through gel permeation chromatography on
bio-gel p10, obtaining notably different chromatographic profiles (fig. 1). a series of peaks, each one corresponding to sizehomogeneous oligomeric families, ranging in size from  xxxg170xxx   xxxg1871xxx  to
dp16 (enoxaparin) or dp18 ( xxxd3379xxx ) and from dp8 to dp22
( xxxd1805xxx ), were resolved. the larger unresolved oligosaccharides were present in different proportions for each lmwh. the
average chain length of most of the components was determined
through analysis by mass spectrometry, by collecting the fractions corresponding to individual peaks (data not shown). moreover, for enoxaparin between peaks of the shortest major oligomers (e.g. tetramers, hexamers etc.) small peaks were observed and were identified as arising from odd-numbered oligomers (i.e. trimer in front of the tetramer; pentamer between the
tetramer and hexamer). from this, a first important compositional difference is immediately apparent: the three lmwhs
greatly differ in their oligosaccharidic distribution. in particular
enoxaparin is the richest in small oligosaccharidic chains from
 xxxg170xxx   xxxg1871xxx  to dp8;  xxxd1805xxx  is the richest in chains larger than dp12,
whereas chains under dp8 are not detectable or negligible.
among the three lmwhs,  xxxd3379xxx  is the one with the highest
polydispersity, all the oligomeric families being represented.
each oligomeric fraction was collected and their relative percentage with respect to the total compound was estimated (fig. 2).
affinity chromatography fractions
affinity chromatography on at-sepharose of lmwhs, resulted
in separation of two portions: the first, eluting at lower ionic
strength, represents the non-adsorbed material and was designated as the “no affinity” (na) fraction; the second, eluting at
higher salt concentration, was designated the “high affinity”
(ha) fraction. the relative content of ha fraction of the three
lmwhs, calculated as a mean of three experiments, appeared
very similar: 13.6 ± 0.71 for enoxaparin, 14.2 ± 0.62 for  xxxd3379xxx , and 13.6 ± 1.21 for  xxxd1805xxx .
with the aim of further fractionating ha components, the
at-sepharose column was overloaded with an amount of each

lmwh corresponding to three times the retention capacity of
the resin. passage of a large excess of heparin species through the
affinity column permits a continuous exchange of adsorbed material and a selection, by multiple passages, of the more strongly
interacting species. three ha subfractions endowed with graded
strength of interaction with at were separated from each
lmwh ( xxxd951xxx , ha2 and ha3, in scaling order of affinity), together with the corresponding no affinity fraction (na).
molecular weights evaluation
molecular weight parameters of enoxaparin,  xxxd3379xxx  and
 xxxd1805xxx , and their corresponding na and ha fractions, were
evaluated by hp-sec/tda. hp-sec on-line with triple detector
array permits the evaluation of the size of polymeric species by
exploiting the combined and simultaneous action of three detectors: laser light scattering (ralls/lalls), refractometer and
viscometer. the method, successfully employed to determine the
molecular weight of ufh and dermatan sulfate (20), does not
require any chromatographic column calibration. a comparison
of the elution profile of the three lmwhs together with a typical
ufh is displayed in figure 3. the resulting molecular weight parameters, mn, mw and d, are shown in table 3. in agreement
with the diversity of biogel p10 elution profiles that was observed for the lmwhs (fig. 1) the parent lmwhs exhibited
very different molecular weight and polydispersity values.  xxxd3379xxx , had the highest average mw (8300 da) and exhibited the
broadest polydispersity (1.40);  xxxd1805xxx  with an mw of 6900
da had the lowest polydispersity degree (1.22), thus appearing as
the most homogeneous sample; enoxaparin had the lowest mw
(5300 da) and an intermediate d value (1.30). all the ha fractions exhibited significantly higher molecular weight with respect to their parent lmwh and, in the case of enoxaparin and
 xxxd3379xxx , they also had a reduced polydispersity. of note is the
fact that no chains below 2400 da were detected in the ha fractions.
of the ha subfractions, only  xxxd951xxx  and na of all lmwhs
and ha3 of enoxaparin were in sufficient quantity for hp-sec/
tda analysis. we find that all  xxxd951xxx  fractions exhibited a decreased mn value and, in parallel, an increase in polydispersity
compared to the ha fraction as a whole (table 1). the ha3 fraction of enoxaparin showed, in turn, consistently reduced mn,

mw and d values with respect to the corresponding ha fraction.
the mw values of na fractions obtained after normal and overloading chromatographic conditions respectively, were comparable. in all cases, na fractions exhibited lower mw values
with respect to parent lmwhs than did the corresponding ha
fractions.
nmr characterisation
all fractions and subfractions separated by affinity chromatography were studied using the quantitative compositional
analysis method based on two-dimensional (2d) 1h-13c correlation measurements (heteronuclear single quantum coherence, hsqc) that have been previously applied towards the characterisation of the corresponding parent lmwhs (13). the average monosaccharide content of the three lmwhs and of all their
fractions are presented in table 2. the data obtained for enoxaparin, compared to that obtained for  xxxd3379xxx  and  xxxd1805xxx 
confirm that enoxaparin contains a larger number of different
monosaccharide residues (fig. 4). whereas we have identified
that oligosaccharide chains within enoxaparin and its fractions
can have eight distinct reducing residues,  xxxd3379xxx  and  xxxd1805xxx  and their fractions have a lower number of possibilities:
i.e., two and one, respectively (13). slight differences in the
monosaccharide composition can be observed between lmwhs
(i.e. a higher content of n-acetyl-glucosamine of  xxxd3379xxx 
with respect to enoxaparin and  xxxd1805xxx ), however, the total
sulfation degree, calculated by adding all different sulfated
monosaccharides, was almost the same (2.4–2.6) for all
lmwhs, indicating that lower n-sulfation is compensated for
by somewhat higher o-sulfation. notably, the ‘‘linkage region’’
(lr) reminiscent of the attachment, through a serine (ser) residue, to the peptide core of the original proteoglycans (26), is appreciable only for  xxxd3379xxx  (3–4%) and practically absent in
enoxaparin and  xxxd1805xxx  (≤1%). the observed difference

might be related either to the manufacturing process or to the
parent heparin used for the lmwh production, or to both.
although both a* and g linked to a* [g-(a*)] residues are
present within the pentasaccharide motif, as has been demonstrated previously,we find that only g-(a*) reliably correlates
with the content of at-bs. indeed, weaker signals associated with
a* residues are found in heparin fractions with no affinity for

at, indicating that this residue can be located also in sequences
not directly involved in the interaction with at (27, 28). conversely, the amount of g-(a*) found in the three lmwhs follows the same trend as their reported anti-xa activity, increasing
from  xxxd3379xxx  (2.1%, 90 ui/mg), to enoxaparin (3.2%, 104
ui/mg), to  xxxd1805xxx  (4.1%, 122 ui/mg) (29). in figure 5, the
g-a* disaccharide is highlighted within the structure formula of
at-bs.
nevertheless, the most important differences are displayed
by each ha and na fraction with respect to the corresponding
parent lmwh. all signals of residues associated to the pentasaccharide sequence are stronger in the ha and especially in the
 xxxd951xxx  fractions with respect to the parent lmwhs and very weak
in the na fractions (table 2 and fig. 4). the amount of both a*
and g-(a*) increases about three times in ha fractions with respect to the parent lmwh. a parallel increase is also observed
for signals associated to iduronic acid linked to n-sulfated6-o-sulfated glucosamine [i-(a6s)], n-acetylated glucosamine
(anac) and n-sulfated glucosamine linked to non-sulfated iduronic acid residues [ans-(i)]. the latter residues are not exclusive to the pentasaccharide sequence aga*ia, since they are

present also in other positions of the heparin chains (12, 27).
however, anac (or less frequently ans) is the first residue of the
pentasaccharide and invariably precedes the natural at-binding
domains of heparin and hs.
less pronounced differences were observed between the
 xxxd951xxx  and ha3 fractions of the same lmwh. a slight decrease of
g-(a*) content from the  xxxd951xxx  to the ha3 fractions of enoxaparin and  xxxd1805xxx  was observed, while the content of the other
residues related to the pentasaccharide sequence varies within
experimental error. only in  xxxd3379xxx  is there a decrease of
about 50% of g-(a*) and a* going from the  xxxd951xxx  (7.2 %) to the
ha3 (3.1 %) fraction.
the average mn values obtained via nmr (table 3) and via
hp-sec/tda (table 1) exhibit the same trend of variation within each family of fractions, confirming the higher molecular
weight of the ha fraction with respect to the na fractions and
the corresponding parent lmwh. with regards to the differences between the  xxxd951xxx  and ha3 fractions of enoxaparin and
 xxxd1805xxx , three different situations were observed. in particular, i) for enoxaparin, a slight decrease of mn with a dp difference of 2–3 monosaccharidic units, ii) for  xxxd3379xxx , a slight in-

appeared. as such,  xxxd1805xxx  was confirmed to be the most
size-homogeneous of the three lmwhs.
the evaluation of dp values allowed us to calculate the average values of the g-(a*)/chain ratios to evaluate the content of
at-bs per chain (table 3). as expected, for ha and  xxxd951xxx  fractions of enoxaparin and  xxxd1805xxx , the content of g-(a*)/chain

was equal to or slightly higher than 1 (1.1, 1.0 and 1.2, 1.1 respectively). their corresponding ha3 fractions revealed a slight
decrease of the g-(a*) content per chain, which was 1 for  xxxd1805xxx  and apparently lower than 1 (0.8) for enoxaparin. an
anomalous situation was represented by  xxxd3379xxx : for all ha
subfractions, the g-(a*) content per chain was reproducibly and
consistently lower than 1 (0.7 for ha and  xxxd951xxx , and 0.4 for
ha3). whereas for enoxaparin and  xxxd1805xxx  the slight de-

crease of at-bs content per chain from  xxxd951xxx  to ha3 appears to be
responsible for their different affinity to at, structures additional
and/or alternative to the at-bs are needed to explain the apparently low content of a-g-a*-i-a in the ha species of  xxxd3379xxx . more in depth investigations are required to clarify this
point.

discussion and conclusions
although the internal structure of lmwh chains is largely unaffected by the most common depolymerisation processes, different approaches to the cleavage of the parent heparin dictates the
type of terminal groups for a particular lmwh, as well as the
average size of fragments, and dispersion of molecular weights
around the average values (12, 28). a first level of characterisation of lmwhs accordingly involves identification and quantification of terminal groups (13) and determination of the average molecular weight and polydispersity. a second, important

level requires determination of the at-binding sequences (atbs). in the present study, assessment of the content of at-bs was
approached both by affinity chromatography which determines
the percent content of species with ha for at (9), and by quantification of nmr of signals identified as specific for the disaccharide g-a* prevalently present in the at-bs (13).
besides generating different terminal residues, different
methods of depolymerisation of heparin currently used to generate lmwhs may cleave glycosidic bonds both outside and inside the at-bs. despite any expected process-related differences,
the percent content of ha species determined by affinity chromatography was quite similar for enoxaparin,  xxxd3379xxx , and
 xxxd1805xxx . however, such a content is not a direct measure of the
actual content of at-bs when this sequence is contained in chains
of different length. as illustrated in figures 1, 2 and 3, the average mw and the distribution of different oligosaccharide components is quite different for the three lmwhs. as shown in
table 1, such a difference is amplified when comparison is made
between the ha and na fractions of each lmwh, ha chains
being consistently longer than na chains. it is noteworthy that
our data indicates that no chains under 2400 da were detected in
ha fractions. although a detailed comparison of compositional
data for the three lmwhs is outside the scope of this publication, it is worth noting that the lr is contained in significant
amounts (3.1%) only in  xxxd3379xxx  and that it is distributed in all
its fractions regardless of their affinity for at. more relevant to
the main aim of this study is the comparison of contents of a*
and g-a* components (shaded columns in table 2). both residues may cause overestimation the active sequence a-g-a*-i-a,
especially when this sequence lacks the essential 6-o-sulfate
group at residue a at its non-reducing end. accordingly, low but
not negligible amounts of both a* and g-a* components were
detected also in na fractions.
the most relevant difference emerging from comparison of
the nmr spectra of the three series of lmwh derived fractions
is the content of at-bs per chain (table 3) estimated by nmr
from the marker signal g-(a*) [as proposed by guerrini et al.
(13)]. we find that the level of g-(a*) is quite different for individual lmwhs as well as for the ha,  xxxd951xxx , ha3 and na fractions of each of them.
furthermore, the data presented in table 3 deserves additional comment. first, the content of g-a* per average chain of
enoxaparin and  xxxd1805xxx  is slightly higher than 1 (1.1 and 1.2,
respectively), suggesting that some of the chains of these

lmwhs, especially the longest chains, may contain two at-bs,
as already observed for ufh (27). on the other hand, data for the
ha fraction of  xxxd3379xxx  and for its subfractions are unexpectedly low (0.7 and 0.4, respectively). although these data may be
explained by structures contributing to the apparent affinity for
at which do not contain intact a-g-a*-i-a sequences, this hypothesis requires in depth studies to be validated.
in this sense, in addition to the different content of at-bs of
heparin oligosaccharides, the extension of the active pentasaccharide sequence can also influence the at binding properties
of an oligosaccharide chain and regulate its interaction with factor iia as well. this, in turn, may influence the anti- xxxg741xxx  and
anti-factor iia activities of the three lmwhs. since the at-bs
can occur randomly within ha heparin chains, its differential
positioning, together with the occurrence of glucuronic acid
rather than iduronic acid at the non-reducing end of aga*ia
(14), can affect the strength of interaction with at and, possibly,

anti-xa activity. moreover, when the extension of the at-bs toward the non-reducing end is sufficiently long (at least 10 residues) to accommodate thrombin, a tertiary complex can be formed which results in thrombin inhibition (17). the larger the extension of the heparin chain beyond the non-reducing end of atbs, the higher is the probability that thrombin molecules can interact with at (16).
studies are in progress on the detailed structure of ha and
na fractions of size homogeneous fractions of the three heparins, with the aim of rationalising the contribution of typical
lmwh chains to the measured anti-xa potency and other biological activities.
