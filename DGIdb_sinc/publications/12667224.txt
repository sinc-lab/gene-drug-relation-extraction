abstract

drug-resistant malaria is primarily caused by plasmodium falciparum, a species highly
prevalent in tropical africa, the amazon region and south-east asia. it causes severe
fever or anaemia that leads to more than a million deaths each year. the emergence
of chloroquine resistance has been associated with a dramatic increase in malaria
mortality among inhabitants of some endemic regions. the rationale for chemoprophylaxis is weakening as multiple-drug resistance develops against well-tolerated
drugs. plasmodium falciparum drug-resistant malaria originates from chromosome
mutations. analysis by molecular, genetic and biochemical approaches has shown
that (i) impaired chloroquine uptake by the parasite vacuole is a common
characteristic of resistant strains, and this phenotype is correlated with mutations
of the pfmdr1, pfcg2 and pfcrt genes; (ii) one to four point mutations of dihydrofolate
reductase (dhfr), the enzyme target of antifolates (pyrimethamine and  xxxd1672xxx )
produce a moderate to high level of resistance to these drugs; (iii) the mechanism of
resistance to sulfonamides and sulfones involves mutations of dihydropteroate
synthase (dhps), their enzyme target; (iv) treatment with sulphadoxine–pyrimethamine selects for dhfr variants ile(51), arg(59), and asn(108) and for dhps
variants ser(436), gly(437), and glu(540); (v) clones that were resistant to some
traditional antimalarial agents acquire resistance to new ones at a high frequency
(accelerated resistance to multiple drugs, armd). the mechanisms of resistance for
amino-alcohols (quinine, mefloquine and  xxxd2258xxx ) are still unclear. epidemiological studies have established that the frequency of chloroquine resistant mutants
varies among isolated parasite populations, while resistance to antifolates is highly
prevalent in most malarial endemic countries. established and strong drug pressure
combined with low antiparasitic immunity probably explains the multidrugresistance encountered in the forests of south-east asia and south america. in
africa, frequent genetic recombinations in plasmodium originate from a high level of
malaria transmission, and falciparum chloroquine-resistant prevalence seems to
stabilize at the same level as chloroquine-sensitive malaria. nevertheless, resistance
levels may differ according to place and time. in vivo and in vitro tests do not provide
an adequate accurate map of resistance. biochemical tools at a low cost are urgently
needed for prospective monitoring of resistance.

introduction
plasmodium falciparum, which is responsible for fatal
malaria in humans, is a major cause of morbidity and
mortality throughout the tropics. each year in africa,

approximately 500 million cases of falciparum malaria
occur, and nearly 2 million people die [1]. this major
public health problem is aggravated by the widespread
diffusion of chloroquine resistance in p. falciparum, accompanied by an increase in malaria-related mortality [2].

chemoresistance, which concerns mainly falciparum, the
parasite for the most serious type of malaria, is one of
the factors in the worldwide upsurge of malaria in tropical
regions. the chemoresistance of p. vivax involves the
antimetabolites and for the past several years in asia,
chloroquine. chloroquine remains generally effective for
p. vivax, p. ovale and p. malariae. the resistance phenotype
is determined by culturing the parasite. it is not necessarily
expressed by treatment failure (particularly in subjects
who have acquired defenses during previous malaria
episodes); inversely, chemoresistance is only one possible
cause of treatment failure. the mechanisms by which
the parasite is chemoresistant to antimalarials generally
involve chromosomal mutations. parasite genetics, which
has now been studied for a decade, should illuminate
the epidemiology of chemoresistance. essentially, malaria
involves the interaction of three populations (humans,
anopheles and plasmodium), and the parasite adapts
through mitotic mutations and meiotic recombinations.
these parasites are extremely diverse, and a subject is
infected on average by three different strains (from the
bite of one or several mosquitoes) [3]. this diversity is
assumed to be based on a high variation in allele frequency
in the initial phase of mutant selection by drug pressure, a
balance of selection and mutation that varies according to
population size, with low levels of mixing in the islands,
and high levels in dense african populations.
mechanism of chloroquine
resistance
the most spectacular characteristic of chloroquine is its
capacity to concentrate itself from nanomolar levels
outside the parasite to millimolar levels in the digestive
vacuole of the intraerythrocytic trophozoite. it is here
that it inhibits haemoglobin degradation and forms
complexes with haematin. the resistant isolates have in
common an alteration in the chloroquine accumulation
in the digestive vacuole. previous theories suggested that
these accumulation deficits were because of changes in
the ph gradient or to altered membrane permeability
related to an efflux mechanism, or both. chloroquineresistance is reversible by verapamil, which modulates
resistance in the cancer cells of multi-drug-resistant
(mdr) mammals. this discovery led to the identification
of the protein pgh1 in the digestive vacuole membrane of
p. falciparum; it is an analog to the glycoproteins
overexpressed in cancer cells where they function as
pumps expelling cytotoxic drugs (atp-binding cassette
transporters). resistance was initially attributed to

variations in the number of copies of the corresponding
gene, the pfmdr1 gene, perhaps combined with isolated
mutations. there is, however, no evidence of amplification of this gene with chloroquine-resistance. chloroquine transport is altered in the cells with modified pgh1.
the associations between isolated mutations of pfmdr1
and chloroquine remain uncertain [4]. it now appears
that chloroquine resistance is related to diminished
uptake of the drug. chloroquine accumulation has high
structural specificity; this suggests the involvement of
either a specific transporter/permease or a molecule
associated with hematin in the digestive vacuole [5].
the pfcrt gene, located on chromosome 7, codes for a
transmembrane protein located in the digestive vacuole
membrane [6]. a set of mutations of this gene is found in
all natural isolates from clinical chloroquine treatment
failures [7] and in vitro in isolates with a chloroquineresistant phenotype [8]. transfection of this genotype
suffices to confer chloroquine resistance. four independent mutation profiles are seen, varying geographically:
asia–africa, papua, south america 1 and 2. the major
event in chloroquine resistance thus is the emergence in
indo–china at the end of the 1950s of mutants selected
by drug pressure; these have spread to 90% of the
territory of p. falciparum in the 40 years since. nonetheless, the wild isolates, which are very polymorphous,
have not been totally replaced; they still represent
approximately half the strains in circulation.
resistance to pyrimethamine,
 xxxd1672xxx  and other
antimetabolites
because plasmodium in humans can capture and use the
host’s purines but not their pyrimidines, the parasites
must synthesize the latter (figure 1). isolated mutations
of the pfdhfr gene are the molecular bases of
p. falciparum resistance to pyrimethamine and to cycloguanil, the active metabolite in  xxxd1672xxx  (paludrineò;
astrazeneca, macclesfield, uk) [9]. in vitro isolates of p.
falciparum from failures of  xxxd1672xxx  prophylaxis or
sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine treatment present resistance
simultaneously to cycloguanil and to pyrimethamine.
the s108n substitution is the principal mutation associated with resistance to pyrimethamine or cycloguanil
in africa and in south-east asia. substitution s108t is
also found in south america [9]. the most frequent
additive mutations are n51i and c59r. the mean ic50
of cycloguanil increases with the number of mutations
[10]. the simple substitution of asn or thr at codon 108

and  xxxd243xxx  ( xxxg1456xxx ).

in the recombinant  xxxg631xxx  (dhfr) of
the parasite reduces the drug’s affinity without affecting
the enzyme’s operation on its natural substrate. multiple
mutations diminish the efficacy of the enzyme on
dihydrofolate and thus suggest that additional mutations
are unfavourable to the parasites in the absence of drug
pressure [11]. the reports below define the resistance
threshold as an ic50 of 50 nmol/l of cycloguanil. for
pfdhfr, 95% of 148 isolates from travellers with a wildtype codon in position 108 (ser) were susceptible and
91% of 68 isolates with serine replaced by asparagine at
codon 108 (s108n) were resistant [12,13]. the s108n
mutation is selected in isolates of travellers taking
 xxxd1672xxx  prophylaxis [14]. in cameroon, the isolates
with an s108n mutation for pfdhfr, alone or combined
with a mutation of codon 59, showed adequate in vivo
clinical response to fansidarò (roche, switzerland), and
those with three pfdhfr mutations responded with
early or late treatment failure ( xxxg1348xxx ) [15]. in physiological conditions, the blood folate concentration can
influence the effect of sulfadoxine, which may explain
the fansidarò failures on p. falciparum isolates with only
an s108n mutation of pfdhfr. it was initially thought
that the mutations on the dihydropteroate synthetase
gene (pfdhps, target of some antifolates) might be
responsible for sulfadoxine resistance. that is, pfdhfr
and pfdhps mutants are selected during sulfadoxine/
pyrimethamine treatment [16]. the progeny of a genetic
cross between sulfadoxine-sensitive and sulfadoxineresistant parents demonstrate the close association
between the pfdhps mutations and resistance and a
complete correlation between multiple pfdhfr mutations and resistance [17]. the predictive value of the

dhps mutations in the wang study was poor. in kenya
and tanzania, the isolates with a s108n mutation of
pfdhfr, alone or combined with a codon 59 mutation,
responded in vivo to fansidarò by an adequate clinical
response (n ¼ 3/3) or  xxxg1348xxx  (n ¼ 6/17), and all those
(n ¼ 13) with three pfdhfr mutations responded by
either early or  xxxg1348xxx  [16]. the predictive value of the
dhps mutations in the curtis study was also poor. in the
peruvian amazon region, 24 isolates with single s108n
or s108t mutations of pfdhfr showed the following in
vivo responses to fansidarò: s (n ¼ 11), ri (n ¼ 8), rii
(n ¼ 4) and riii (n ¼ 1); all those (n ¼ 21) with three or
more mutations of pfdhfr had grades ri–riii responses
[18,19]. the predictive value of the dhps mutations in
this study was 21of 34. cross-resistance has been
demonstrated between cycloguanil and pyrimethamine,
and the potential use of other antifolates such as
chlorproguanil plus dapsone (lapdapò; glaxosmithkline; uxbridge, uk) to treat strains resistant to sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine seems limited [16].  xxxd243xxx ,
whose target is supposed to be  xxxg1456xxx  in the
pyrimidine metabolic pathway [20], can be used with
 xxxd1672xxx  (malaroneò; glaxosmithkline) to treat malaria. as with the antifolates, use of  xxxd243xxx  alone
against p. falciparum leads to rapid selection for resistant
mutants [21].
multiple-drug chemoresistance
multiple-drug chemoresistance for malaria refers to
the resistance to several antimalarial drugs that has
been observed in p. falciparum. it can be simultaneous
or cross-resistance. simultaneous resistance results

principally from the large-scale and simultaneous use
of several antimalarials, which causes strong selective
pressure. accordingly, cycloguanil resistance is added
to chloroquine resistance, as is pyrimethamine–sulfadoxine (fansidarò) resistance, to the extent to the
latter is combined with or used to back up chloroquine. the heterogeneity of these multiple-resistant
strains corresponds to the distribution of the level of

malaria transmission (figure 2) and drug pressure
(table i).
cross-resistance between antimalarials is a phenomenon linked to the common or shared aspects of their
modes of action and probably of their resistance mechanisms. a close correlation was observed between
sensitivity to cycloguanil and pyrimethamine in 314 isolates from africa (r ¼ 0.9, personal data). the parasites

the threshold of 50% of dual resistance was chosen to classify a country in zone iii [26].

that have a high level of chloroquine resistance, as in
south-east asia, are generally resistant to  xxxd159xxx 
as well (flavoquineò [aventis, france] and camoquinò
[parke davis, usa]). the same is probably true in this
region for mefloquine (lariamò [roche] and mephaquinò [mepha]) and  xxxd2258xxx  (halfanò [glaxosmithkline]). a correlation analysis is the first indication of a
common mode of action and perhaps of a common
mechanism of resistance. it is possible to assess in vitro
the response of a single strain to several antimalarials
and therefore to compare the action of different lysosomotropic antimalarials in a population of parasites.
accordingly, in the african p. falciparum strains imported into france, the variation of the level of sensitivity to
monodesethyl– xxxd159xxx , the active metabolite of
 xxxd159xxx , can be explained by the level of chloroquine sensitivity.  xxxd159xxx  may thus fail in subjects
infested by highly chloroquine-resistant strains. a similar rationale may account for  xxxd2258xxx  failures with
mefloquine-resistant strains. the inverse correlation
observed between chloroquine and mefloquine or  xxxd2258xxx  reflects an opposite trend: chloroquine-sensitive
strains are substantially less sensitive to mefloquine or
 xxxd2258xxx  and vice versa in africa [22,23]. in vitro
evidence thus tends to support the view that chloroquine

and  xxxd159xxx  share common mechanism of resistance, as do mefloquine and  xxxd2258xxx  [24]. clinical
evidence however does not confirm frequent crossresistance between chloroquine and  xxxd159xxx  [25].
similarly, epidemiologic evidence about the origin of
multiple drug resistance observed in south-east asia, in
particular, does not allow us to determine whether we
see a common mechanism of resistance for diverse antimalarials or independent selection of resistance to each
compound (table ii). important and multiple drug pressure has existed since the beginning of the 1950s, with
the combined use of chloroquine,  xxxd159xxx , quinine,
and then after 1980, mefloquine as lysosomotropic
agents. multiple resistance has not been observed in
the absence of substantial utilization of the corresponding antimalarial. a single mechanism of resistance
preventing the accumulation of several compounds by
some p. falciparum strains in the border areas of thailand
may nonetheless explain the frequent multiple drug
resistance in these regions (accelerated resistance to
multiple drugs). in the grassland regions of africa, the
efficacy of antimalarials is highly heterogeneous, as
numerous authors have observed, with excellent response to doses less than the standard chloroquine or
quinine regimen (in the absence of immunity) or poor

conclusion
the absence of rigorous clinical studies on the chemoresistance of p. falciparum (with blood assays for
antimalarials) make it difficult to determine the respective roles of clinical resistance on the one hand and
dosage errors and defective compliance, very frequent in
chemical prophylaxis and in treatment, on the other
[26]. the types of resistance observed in the laboratory
in p. falciparum are linked to one or several associated
chromosomal mutations. amplification of genes linked
to chemoresistance has not been observed but overexpression of proteins or differences in drug accumulation
could explain the differences in sensitivity for the same
mutation profiles. we currently lack information about
the back-mutation of resistance and the possible disadvantages of mutant strains relative to the wild type.
regionally, the levels and proportions of chemoresistance are highly heterogeneous and can probably be
explained by drug pressure, in particular, from slowelimination drugs such as sulfadoxine–pyrimethamine or
mefloquine. a single point mutation, easily selected by
drug pressure, is sufficient to create resistance to an
antimetabolite. it appears in multiple foci, with a high
frequency for pfdhfr. half of the african isolates
studied carry at least two mutations, enough to impede
the efficacy of  xxxd1672xxx  or pyrimethamine, given alone.

the proportion of isolates with three or more mutations,
resistant to the sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine combination, is not known. chloroquine resistance, which is
more complex, probably corresponds to several simultaneous but rare mutations (that probably appeared alone
at the end of the 1950s and then dispersed by migration). it involves a phenotype that prevents accumulation of the drug. its overall prevalence in africa is now
around 50%, with no evidence of a major increase in the
last decade, but with important geographic fluctuations.
resistance to quinine, mefloquine and  xxxd2258xxx  is
probably because of mechanisms of the type observed for
chloroquine. unlike chloroquine, however, these compounds do not currently face high levels of resistance,
and they thus remain, depending on the region,
completely or partly active. the most critical situation
is in the jungle areas of thailand, cambodia and
myanmar, where multiple drug chemoresistance has
been frequent since 1980. this situation, which fortunately corresponds to a very low proportion of malaria
worldwide, is a worrisome singularity that is nonetheless
extremely useful for the study of multiple drug resistance
and its treatments. as the alternating use of antimalarials in pandemic areas is illusory, it seems essential
to combine them for treatment and for prophylaxis in
order to limit the extension of resistant genotypes.
