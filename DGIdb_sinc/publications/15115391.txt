six previously undescribed n-(2,4-diaminopteridin-6-yl)methyldibenz[b,f]azepines with watersolubilizing o-carboxyalkyloxy or o-carboxybenzyloxy side chains at the 2′-position were
synthesized and compared with trimethoprim (tmp) and  xxxd2968xxx  (ptx) as inhibitors of
 xxxg631xxx  (dhfr) from pneumocystis carinii (pc), toxoplasma gondii (tg), and
mycobacterium avium (ma), three of the opportunistic organisms known to cause significant
morbidity and mortality in patients with aids and other disorders of the immune system.
the ability of the new analogues to inhibit reduction of dihydrofolate to tetrahydrofolate by
pc, tg, ma, and rat dhfr was determined, and the selectivity index (si) was calculated from
the ratio ic50(rat dhfr)/ic50(pc, tg, or ma dhfr). the ic50 values of the 2′-o-carboxypropyl
analogue (10), with si values in parentheses, were 1.1 nm (1300) against pc dhfr, 9.9 nm
(120) against tg dhfr, and 2.0 nm (600) against ma dhfr. the corresponding values for
the 2′-o-(4-carboxybenzyloxy) analogue (12) were 1.0 nm (560), 22 nm (21), and 0.75 nm (630).
by comparison, the ic50 and si values for tmp were pc, 13 000 nm (14); tg, 2800 nm (65);
and ma, 300 nm (610). for the prototypical potent but nonselective inhibitors ptx and tmx,
respectively, these values were pc, 13 nm (0.26) and 47 nm (0.17); tg, 4.3 nm (0.76) and 16
nm (0.50); ma, 0.61 nm (5.4) and 1.5 nm (5.3). thus 10 and 12 met the criterion for dhfr
inhibitors that combine the high selectivity of tmp with the high potency of ptx and tmx.
introduction
despite the considerable number of active new antiretroviral agents and a growing understanding of the
origin and potential means of circumvention of drug
resistance to these agents, typically through the use of
multidrug cocktails,1,2 major progress in the treatment
of aids has thus far been confined to the economically
most affluent countries of the world. as a result of
limited access to these often very costly antiviral
medications in underdeveloped nations,3 disabling and
often life-threatening opportunistic infections by various
parasites to which aids patients are especially vulnerable4 are a global public health concern with major
social and political implications.5 among the more
prevalent of these infections, and indeed in some cases
the earliest event signaling t-cell destruction by the
hiv-1 or hiv-2 virus, are those caused by the opportunistic organisms pneumocystis carinii (pc),6 toxoplasma gondii (tg),7,8 mycobacterium avium (ma),9 and
cryptosporidium parvum (cp),10 to name just four.
because of the severe impact that infections by these
often coexisting parasites can have on the duration and
quality of life of aids patients, and because a general
concensus is lacking as to the proper length of treatment
with antiparasitic drugs once intensive multidrug antihiv therapy has brought down the number of virus

particles in the blood to very low levels, efforts are
continuing to find newer agents that can complement
the currently available drugs for treatment and/or
prophylaxis of hiv-associated opportunistic infections.
our laboratory11 and others12-15 have been engaged
since the early 1990s in the design and synthesis of
small-molecule inhibitors of  xxxg631xxx 
(dhfr), in the hope of finding agents that would be
superior to two-drug antifolate regimens combining, for
example, an inhibitor of dihydropteroate synthetase
(e.g., sulfamethoxazole or dapsone) with a dhfr inhibitor such as trimethoprim (1) or pyrimethamine (2).16
coadministration of the sulfa drug is typically required
in the case of trimethoprim because the latter, when
given alone, is not potent enough to completely eradicate
the infection. however many patients develop severe
allergic skin reactions to sulfa drugs17 and therefore
have to discontinue treatment before a complete cure
is achieved. furthermore, given the fact that only
mutations in dihydropteroate synthetase, and not dhfr,
have been observed in resistant pc strains, investigators
are beginning to question the role of trimethoprim in
 xxxd1734xxx  (trimethoprim + sulfamethoxazole), the
two-drug combination almost universally prescribed for
pc prophylaxis.18 a much more potent dhfr inhibitor
than trimethoprim, approved a few years ago for use in
aids patients suffering from pneumocystis carinii
pneumonia, is  xxxd3442xxx  (3).19 unlike trimethoprim,
which is much more selective in its ability to bind
selectively to pc dhfr and other opportunistic para-

sites as compared with human dhfr,  xxxd3442xxx

dhfr than trimethoprim. in a subsequent study, the
3d structure of the ternary complex of 6 and nadph
with pc dhfr was analyzed by crystallography, and
an unusual role was uncovered for the dibenz[b,f]azepine moiety in positioning the diaminopteridine
within the active site.23
in an assay based on measurement of [3h]uracil
incorporation into the dna of tg tachyzoites in culture,
6 had an ic50 of 0.077 µm22 and thus was roughly 100
times more potent than pyrimethamine. reasonable
growth inhibition was also observed against intact p.
carinii organisms grown on monolayers of human
embryonic lung fibroblasts (with  xxxd2146xxx  present in
the medium in order to protect the feeder cells). the
ic50 of 6 in this assay was estimated to be ca. 2 µm,
whereas trimethoprim had essentially no effect.22 although the methods used to compare activity against
intact pc and tg organisms were different, there was
reasonable consistency between the dhfr inhibition
data on one hand and the growth inhibition data on the
other. in sum, 6 appeared to be a promising starting
point from which to launch structure-activity optimization with both species, as well as ma, as targets.
the results with other compounds in our original
study22 suggested that the dibenz[b,f]moiety might be
contributing in a major way to the structure-activity
and structure-selectivity profile. an attempt to enhance
the potency of 6 by replacing the pteridine ring with a
 xxxd3047xxx [2,3-d]pyrimidine or quinazoline, or by interchanging the azepine ring nitrogen and ch2 bridge, did
not yield encouraging results.24 however, we now report
that a substantial improvement in potency and selectivity against not only tg dhfr but also pc and ma dhfr
can be realized by modifying the 2′-position of the
dibenz[b,f]azepine ring as in structures 7-12. the
carboxylic acid side chain in these compounds is also
present as a key structural motif in several recently
studied 2,4-diamino-5-(2′,5′-disubstituted benzyl)]pyrimidines from this laboratory.11a,b the best of the new
analogues reported here is 2,4-diamino-6-[2′-o-(3-carboxypropyl)oxydibenz-[b,f]azepin-5-yl]methylpteridine
(10), which has an ic50 of 1.1 nm against pc dhfr and
a remarkable selectivity index of 1300 (95% confidence
interval ) 850-2000) for pc versus rat dhfr. compound 10 is also very potent and selective against ma
dhfr, but is less selective against the tg enzyme than
against the pc or ma enzyme. to our knowledge, it is
among the most potent and selective inhibitors of pc
dhfr reported to date.

closely resembles  xxxd3442xxx  in that it has very high
affinity for dhfr, but lacks selectivity and thus requires  xxxd2462xxx  coadministration.20 the explanation
generally given for this selectivity of protection is that
the parasites synthesize their own reduced folate cofactors de novo and therefore, in contrast to mammalian
cells, have no need for folate transporter proteins in
their cell membrane.21 given the limitations of both the
trimethoprim/sulfa and  xxxd3442xxx / xxxd2462xxx  regimens mentioned above, a single dhfr inhibitor combining the potency of  xxxd3442xxx  (or  xxxd2968xxx ) with
the species selectivity of trimethoprim would be desirable, in that it would eliminate the need to coadminister
either a sulfa drug or  xxxd2462xxx .
in 1999 we reported the synthesis of a novel group of
2,4-diaminopteridine dhfr inhibitors containing a
lipophilic tricyclic group at the 6-position, as exemplified
by general structure 5.22 the most interesting member
of the series was the dibenz[b,f]azepine 6, whose potency

chemistry

and selectivity against pc dhfr were only moderate,
but whose potency against tg dhfr approached that
of  xxxd3442xxx . moreover, while  xxxd3442xxx  was a
better inhibitor of the mammalian dhfr (in this case
the rat enzyme) and thus was completely devoid of
selectivity, 6 showed a 100-fold binding preference for
tg dhfr. compound 6 was also several times more
potent and selective against ma dhfr than rat dhfr
and was a much better inhibitor of both tg and ma

the synthesis of compounds 7-12 from dibenz[b,f]azepine (iminostilbene, 13) is depicted in scheme 1 and
required us to prepare the key intermediate 5h-dibenz[b,f]azepin-2-ol (15) which was obtained essentially as
described in the literature.25,26 oxidation of 13 with
potassium nitrosodisulfonate (fremy’s salt) at 5 °c
overnight in a mixture of acetone and potassium phosphate buffer adjusted to precisely ph 7.22 afforded the
deep-red iminoquinone 14 in 77% yield. also formed,
and easily separated by silica gel chromatography, was
a small amount (ca. 10%) of acridine-9-carboxaldehyde,
readily identified by the presence in its 1h nmr
spectrum of a singlet at delta 11.5 for the aldehyde proton.

some unchanged 13 (ca. 10%) was also recovered and
could be recycled. the 1h nmr spectrum of purified 14
featured a well-defined pair of doublets at delta 7.20 and delta
7.57 which we assigned to the 10,11-double bond. the
lower-field doublet at delta 7.57 was tentatively assigned
to the proton at the 11-position on the basis of its closer
proximity to the electronegative oxygen on the quinone
ring. it should be noted that a number of reaction
conditions based on literature examples of the use of
fremy’s salt27 were investigated with the aim of minimizing the formation of side products in this somewhat
capricious oxidation. the ph should optimally be maintained between 7.2 and 8.3, as the yield drops when the
ph is <7.2, whereas a large amount of tar forms when
the ph is >8.5. it is also important to continuously
purge the system with argon during rotary evaporation
of the reaction mixture to dryness. and finally, because
14 is somewhat unstable when adsorbed on silica gel,
as well as air- and light-sensitive, it should not be
allowed to remain on the column any longer than is
necessary to obtain it in a pure enough state for the next
step, and should be protected from bright illumination
as much as possible.
extraction of a solution of 14 in chcl3 in a separatory
funnel with aqueous na2s2o4 (sodium hydrosulfite) for
a few minutes until the color changed from red to yellow
afforded the alcohol l5 (87%) as a pale greenish-yellow
solid whose 1h nmr spectrum featured a pair of
doublets at delta 6.07 and delta 6.17 for the azepinyl protons,
a broad singlet at delta 6.04 for the proton on n-5, and a
sharp singlet at delta 8.82 for the phenolic proton. the
distinctive upfield shifts of the azepinyl protons, the c-1,
c-3, and c-4 protons, and even the protons of the other
ring in comparison with 14 were fully consistent with
reduction of the quinone to a phenol. treatment of 15
with tert-butylchlorodimethylsilane (tbdmscl) and
et3n in chcl3 (room temperature, 4 h) afforded the
protected ether 16 (71%). this selective o-silylation step
was critical in that it prevented reoxidation and also
made it possible to selectively alkylate n-5 without
o-alkylating the phenol.
initial attempts to condense 16 with 2,4-diamino-6bromomethylpteridine as in our earlier synthesis of 6
were unpromising, and we therefore turned our attention to the versatile synthon 2-amino-3-cyano-5-chloromethylpyrazine (17),28 with which we already had
some experience in the synthesis of 2,4-diamino-6-

arylaminomethylpteridines with bulky aryl substituents.29 when 16 and 17 were stirred in the presence of
k2co3 in mecn at room temperature for 72 h the
desired amino nitrile 18 was isolated in 43% yield as a
light-yellow powder after silica gel flash chromatography (4:1 chcl3-meoh). notably, all the protons of the
dibenzazepine ring system in 18 were shifted upfield
relative to 15 and 16, suggesting that the n-5 substituent has a pronounced effect on the magnetic ring current
of the entire tricyclic system.
although we had originally thought that heating 18
with guanidine in refluxing etoh would result in ring
closure without loss of the o-tbdms group, we were
pleasantly surprised to find that under the conditions
used for this reaction (refluxing etoh, 24 h) the
protecting group was removed, presumably by the
naoet used to convert guanidine hydrochloride to the
free base. after chromatography on silica gel (85:15
chcl3-meoh), the deprotected ring closure product 7
was obtained in 60% yield as a light-yellow powder.
that the desired annulation product had formed with
concomitant loss of the o-protecting group was confirmed by the 1h nmr spectrum, which contained a
singlet at delta 8.66, which is characteristic for the c-7
proton in 6-substituted 2,4-diaminopteridines, but no
trace of a singlet at ca. delta 0.1 for the tbdms group,
which had been prominently visible in the spectra of
16 and 18.
o-alkylation of 7 was typically performed (except in
one case as discussed below) in a one-pot operation in
which freshly prepared naoet was dissolved in dry
dmso under an argon atmosphere, the phenol was then
added, and after 30 min to allow the na salt to form, a
10% molar excess of a bromo ester was added. the
reaction mixture was left to stir overnight under argon,
the ester group was cleaved directly with aqueous
naoh, and the deprotected product was isolated in
analytically pure form by two-stage chromatography,
initially on dowex 50w-x2 (h2o, then 1.5% nh4oh
to elute the product as an ammonium salt) and then on
silica gel (3% acoh in 4:1 chcl3-meoh to elute the
product as the free acid). in the case of the 2′-o-(2carboxyethyl) analogue 9, attempted alkylation of the
anion of 7 with ethyl 3-bromopropanoate led to almost
none of the desired ester, presumably reflecting facile
base-catalyzed beta-elimination to methyl acrylate. to
circumvent this problem, alkylation of the anion of 7

was performed with 3-bromopropanoic acid in the presence of an extra 1 equiv of base. the superiority of
3-bromopropanoic acid over methyl 3-bromopropanoate
in the o-alkylation of a phenolic oh group is wellknown, and was noted, for example, by kuyper and coworkers30 during their synthesis of the trimethoprim
analogue 2,4-diamino-5-[3′-o-(3-carboxyethoxy)-4′,5′dimethoxybenzyl]pyrimidine. interestingly, when the
crude acid 9 was eluted from a dowex 50w-x2 (h+
form) column with 1.5% nh4oh, and the eluate was
acidified with hcl (instead of acoh), freeze-dried, and
finally chromatographed on silica gel using chcl3meoh as the eluent, the isolated product gave a tlc
spot with a much higher rf than would be expected from
an acid, and its elemental analysis as well as 1h nmr
and mass spectra confirmed that it was in fact the
methyl ester 9a. saponification of 9a, followed by ionexchange chromatography and acidification of the nh4oh eluate with hcl, yielded the hydrated sesquihydrochloride salt of 9 with an overall 22% yield starting from
7.
enzyme inhibition
the ability of 8-12 and their phenolic precursor 7 to
inhibit reduction of dihydrofolate by pc, tg, ma, and
rat dhfr in the presence of nadph was determined
spectrophotometrically at 340 nm according to the
standardized assays we have used previously.22,31,32
 xxxd543xxx  was tested as a sesquihydrochloride salt,
the form in which it was obtained after purification, but
this was not expected to affect the results since the ph
of the dhfr assay medium was buffered to ph 7.4. the
ic50 value and selectivity index (si), together with the
corresponding 95% confidence intervals, are shown for
each compound in table 1. also included for comparison
are the ic50 and si values for trimethoprim and  xxxd2968xxx  as prototypical examples of dhfr inhibitors that
can be viewed as weak but selective (trimethoprim)
versus potent but nonselective ( xxxd2968xxx ).
pneumocystis carinii dhfr. the ic50 of the 2′hydroxy derivative 7 against pc dhfr was approxi-

mately 2-fold lower than that of 6. however, because
potency against rat dhfr increased to an even greater
degree, this modification was unfavorable for selectivity
against the pc enzyme. replacement of the 2′-hydroxy
group by a 2′-o-carboxymethyl or 2′-o-(2-carboxyethyl)
group as in 8 and 9, respectively, did not improve
inhibition of pc dhfr in comparison with 7. in contrast,
the 2′-o-(3-carboxypropyl analogue 10 had an ic50 of
1.1 nm against pc dhfr as compared with 1500 nm
against the rat enzyme, corresponding to a selectivity
index of 1300, a value 34 times greater than that of 6,
and among the highest we have observed in our work
on pc dhfr inhibitors to date. interestingly, the longer
homologue 11, with four ch2 groups in the side chain,
was less potent and also less selective than 10, indicating that potency and selectivity diminish when the
number of ch2 groups in the side chain exceeds three.
this contrasted with our earlier findings on 2,4-diamino[2′-methoxy-5′-(omega-carboxyalkyloxy)benzyl]pyrimidines,
where potency and selectivity against pc dhfr was
greater with four rather than three ch2 groups in the
side chain.11a this difference can probably be explained
on the basis that the larger diaminoheterocyclic moiety
in 7 projects the cooh group somewhat differently into
the binding pocket of the enzyme. of interest, finally,
was the considerable potency and selectivity of the 2′o-(4-carboxybenzyl) analogue 12, whose ic50 of 1.0 nm
equaled that of 10 although its selectivity index of 560
was somewhat lower. this finding suggests that replacement of the ch2ch2ch2 chain by a benzyl group
is allowed, and that this type of structural modification
may be worth exploring (e.g., by making the corresponding phenethyl derivative or moving the carboxyl
group to the meta or ortho position).
trimethoprim has been reported by workers at hoffman-laroche to inhibit pc and human dhfr with ic50
values of 46 and 900 µm, respectively, corresponding
to a selectivity index of 20.33 by contrast, in comparisons
of the activity of trimethoprim against pc and rat dhfr
under standardized conditions, the average si value

proximately 10 years has been only 14 (95% confidence
interval 10-20) (table 1). in assays comparing pc and
human dhfr the ic50 and selectivity values of the
newer trimethoprim analogue 2,4-diamino-6-(3′,5′-diethoxy-4′-pyrrolobenzyl)pyrimidine (epiroprim, 19) were

900 and 600 000 (i.e., a somewhat higher selectivity
index of 670). more recently, piper and co-workers13a
reported a pteridine derivative, 21, with ic50 values of
770 nm against tg dhfr and 250 000 nm against rat
dhfr (si ) 320), and a  xxxd3047xxx [2,3-d]pyrimidine derivative, 22, whose corresponding ic50 values were 7.9 and
770 nm (si ) 98) thus, 22 was more potent but less
selective than 21. compound 10 (ic50 ) 9.9 nm) was
78-fold more potent than 21 but only 7-fold more potent
than 22, and its selectivity index appeared to fall
between the two of them. however, because 95% confidence intervals were not reported for 21 and 22, the
differences in selectivity among the three compounds
should probably be viewed with caution. regardless of
whether the selectivity difference between 10 and 21
withstands statistical analysis, it seems clear that 10
is one of the most potent lipophilic 2,4-diamino-6substituted pteridines we have encountered until now.

reported by the hoffman-laroche group to be 3000 nm
and 200, respectively,33 whereas in assays comparing
pc and rat dhfr these values were found to be 2600
nm and 160.34 thus, the potency and selectivity 10 as
an inhibitor of pc dhfr appear to be superior to those
of both trimethoprim and epiroprim.
interestingly, when the selectivities of several antifolates, including 6 and trimethoprim, for pc versus
either rat or human dhfr were compared, a considerable variation in the species selectivity pattern was
observed.35,36 while the si of trimethoprim for pc versus
human dhfr was ca. 50% higher than the si for pc
versus rat dhfr, the si of 6 for pc versus rat and
human enzyme was virtually the same. in striking
contrast, the si of the triazenyl pyrimethamine analogue tab (20)14a,b for pc versus human dhfr was 350fold higher than the si for pc versus rat dhfr.

toxoplasma gondii dhfr. the 2′-hydroxy analogue 7 was nearly as potent as 6 against tg dhfr,
but was a 73-fold better inhibitor of the rat enzyme. as
a result, 7 was less selective than 6. the 2′-o-carboxymethyl analogue 8 was very similar to 7 in terms of both
potency and selectivity. in the case of the 2′-o-(2carboxyethyl) and 2′-o-(4-carboxybutyl) analogues 9 and
11 there was a small improvement in selectivity, but
this reflected a decrease in the inhibition of the rat
enzyme rather than an increase in inhibition of the tg
enzyme. on the other hand, the selectivity of 2′-o-(3carboxypropyl) analogue 10 was  xxxd102xxx  than that
of the other congeners, apparently as a result of the
combined effect of increased inhibition of tg dhfr and
decreased inhibition of rat dhfr. although 10 was the
most potent and selective inhibitor of tg dhfr among
the compounds in this group, its selectivity was 10 times
lower against this enzyme than against pc dhfr,
indicating that whatever differences in the 3d structure
of the active site may exist between rat and tg dhfr,
these differences are not exploited as effectively by this
2′-modification as the corresponding differences between
the rat and pc enzymes.
in assays comparing tg and human dhfr, the
hoffman-laroche group found trimethoprim to have
ic50 values of 2700 nm and 900 000 nm, i.e., a selectivity index of 330.33 for epiroprim (19), these values were

mycobacterium avium dhfr. as shown in table
1, the 2′-hydroxy group in 7 resulted in a one-log
increase in potency against m. avium dhfr relative
to 6, but because this was nearly matched by a 73-fold
increase in potency against the rat enzyme, the selectivity index did not change appreciably. with the introduction of a 2′-o-(carboxymethyl) group, as in 8, there was
a slight increase in potency against ma dhfr relative
to 6. however, because this was accompanied by a larger
11-fold decrease in potency against the rat enzyme, this
modification appeared to have a detrimental effect on
selectivity, just as it did in the case of the pc and tg
enzymes. the 2′-o-(2-carboxyethyl) analogue 9 was
8-fold more selective than 8, and this appeared to be
due to a combination of increased inhibition of the ma
enzyme and decreased inhibition of the rat enzyme.
elongation of the side chain to three ch2 groups, as in
10, elicited a 4-fold increase in potency and an 18-fold
increase in selectivity relative to 8. however, when one
more ch2 group was introduced, as in 11, potency and
selectivity both decreased, recalling the pattern observed with 11 versus 10 against pc and tg dhfr.
replacement of the 2′-o-(3-carboxypropyl) group of 10
by a 2′-o-(4-carboxybenzyl) group, as in 12, led to a
modest increase in potency against the ma enzyme, but
because this was accompanied by a similar increase in
potency against the rat enzyme there was essentially
no change in selectivity, with both compounds giving
an si value of ca. 600. the ic50 of 12 against ma dhfr
was several times lower than the reported values for
2,4-diamino-5-[2′-methoxy-5′-o-(4-carboxybutyl)oxybenzyl]pyrimidine (23, ic50 ) 5.8 nm)11a and 2,4-diamino5-[2′-methoxy-5′-(4-carboxy-1-butynyl)benzyl]pyrimidine (24, ic50 ) 4.4 nm),11b the most potent inhibitors
of this enzyme we had encountered up to that point.
apart from its excellent potency, the selectivity of 12
for ma versus rat dhfr (si ) 630) was of the same
order as that of 23 (si ) 660) and 24 (si ) 910). it
should be noted, however, that 10 and 12 are neither

the most potent nor the most selective ma dhfr
inhibitors thus far described in the literature. for
example, workers at hoffman-laroche have reported
that epiroprim (19) has an ic50 of 4.1 nm against ma
dhfr and a prodigious selectivity index of >14 000
relative to the human enzyme.33 a second compound,
2,4-diamino-5-methyl-6-[(3′,5′-di-n-propyloxyanilino)methyl] xxxd3047xxx [2,3-d]pyrimidine (25), which may be
viewed as an analogue of both  xxxd2968xxx  (heterocyclic
system) and  xxxd3442xxx  (bridge), was reported by
suling and co-workers13b to have an ic50 of only 0.19
nm against ma dhfr, with a selectivity index of 7300
relative to the human enzyme. several other compounds
in their series had ic50 values of <1.0 nm and selectivities of >1000.37 since the si of 6 for pc versus human
dhfr has been found to be comparable to its si for pc
versus rat dhfr,35 and compounds 10 and 12 have the
same basic structure as 6, their si for ma versus human
dhfr is not likely to differ much from the values in
table 1. thus, where ma dhfr inhibition is concerned,
these compounds are of interest only insofar as they are
the best pteridine derivatives in our work to date.
however, on the basis of the results obtained by the
southern research institute groups,13b analogues of 25

with a 2′-(3-carboxypropyl)oxy moiety in the side chain
would be of potential interest. given the promising in
vitrodatarecentlyreportedforthecombinationepiroprimdapsone against mycobacterium leprae and mycobacterium ulcerans,38 potent and selective dhfr inhibitors
of the type reported in this paper could be considered
for testing against non-aids associated mycobacteria.

modeling studies
to better understand the reason for the remarkable
selectivity of binding of 10 to pc dhfr, we used sybyl
6.939 on a silicon graphics octane 2 workstation to
perform a computational simulation of the 3d structure
of the ternary complex with nadph. the starting
coordinates for the simulation were generated by leastsquares superposition of the pteridine moiety of 10 onto
the previously solved crystal structure of the ternary
complex with pc and human dhfr with 6 as the bound
ligand.22,23 the complex was solvated in a box of water,
but the current force field did not take polarizable
parameters into account. in considering such a model,
it is important to remember that molecular dynamics
can only regarded as snapshots of low energy states,
and that a global minimum is unlikely to be derived by
this method even after extensive cycles of dynamics
simulation and energy minimization.
the simulated structure of the ternary complex of 10
and nadph with pc and human dhfr is presented
in figure 1, which depicts a view looking down into the
cleft of the enzyme where the diaminopyrimidine moiety
lies buried. based on the finding that every residue in
the active site of human and rat dhfr is conserved,35
the assumption was made that the 3d structure of the
ternary complex of 10 would probably be very similar,
if not identical, with both enzymes. visible in both panel
a and panel b is the nonplanar dibenzazepine ring
system and its rotationally twisted orientation with
respect to the diaminopteridine moiety, already noted
in the case of 6.23 important active site residues located
within a 4.5 å radius from the inhibitor are denoted
according to standard amino acid nomenclature. the
inhibitor is anchored to both enzymes through the usual
interaction of protonated n1 and the 2-amino group of
the pteridine moiety with  xxxd2431xxx  (e32 in the pc
enzyme; e30 in the human enzyme). the n4 amino
group lies within h-bonding distance of backbone amide
oxygens in i10 and i123 of pc dhfr and i7 and v115
of human dhfr (omitted from the figure). the inhibitor

 xxxg631xxx  inhibitors

lies in a hydrophobic channel that allows for van der
waals interaction of the dibenzazepine moiety with
phenylalanine (f69, 5.75 å to the center of the a-ring,40
offset stacking), proline (p66, 3.77 å from the center of
the b-ring), and leucine (l25, 3.80 å to the center of
c-ring) in the case of the pc enzyme, and with phenylalanine (f31, 4.65 å to the center of the a-ring, offset
stacking), and proline (p61, 4.14 å to the center of the
b-ring) in the case of the human enzyme. the offset
stacking interaction of f69 with one face of the a-ring
in the pc enzyme is not possible in the human enzyme,
whose corresponding residue is asparagine (n64). instead there is in the human ternary complex an offset
stacking interaction of f31 with the opposite face of the
a-ring. probably of greatest importance in terms of
species-selective dhfr inhibition, however, is the ionic
or h-bonded interaction of the terminal cooh group
of 10 with the -amino group of a lysine residue ( xxxd904xxx )
in pc dhfr, which is not possible in the case of the
human enzyme because the homologous residue is a
neutral glutamine (q35). although it would possible in
principle for the conh2 side chain of q35 to engage in
an ion-dipole interaction with this cooh group, the
contribution of ion-dipole interactions in molecular
recognition is considered to be weaker than ionic
interactions.41 thus ion-dipole interaction between the
cooh group and q35 in human dhfr is unlikely to
produce as much binding energy as ionic interaction of
the cooh group with the positively charged amino
group of  xxxd904xxx  in pc dhfr.
the cooh group of 10 appears to lie within approximately 3 å of the arginine side chain in both the
pc (r75) and the human (r70) enzyme. the energyminimized distances between the o2 and o3 atoms of
the cooh group and the -nh2 group of  xxxd904xxx  are 3.19
and 3.09 å. the distances between these oxygens and
the n2 and n1 atoms, respectively, of the guanidine
group are 4.02 and 2.99 å for pc dhfr, and 2.96 and
2.97 å for human dhfr. since the arginine residue is
conserved in both enzymes, it presumably cannot account for the observed preferential inhibition of the pc
enzyme. it is worth noting that similar interactions of
the lysine and arginine residues in pc and human
dhfr with the side-chain cooh group of 24 were
predicted from modeling studies42a and subsequently
confirmed by crystallography.42b crystallographic analysis of the 3d structure of the ternary complex of 10 with
nadph and pc dhfr is currently being performed in
dr. vivian cody’s laboratory, and the results will be
reported in due course.

dhfr, with ic50 values of 9.9 and 2.0 nm and si values
of 120 and 600, respectively. thus it was somewhat less
potent and selective against these enzymes than against
pc dhfr. 2,4-diamino-6-[2′-o-(4-carboxybenzyl)oxydibenz[b,f]azepine (12) was as potent as 10 but somewhat less selective against pc and tg dhfr and was
approximately as potent and selective against ma
dhfr. these compounds are the most active pteridines
we have tested to date against these enzymes and may
be viewed as promising leads for further investigation.
especially attractive would be the possibility of using a
compound such as 10 without coadministration of a
sulfa drug to boost efficacy or  xxxd2462xxx  to prevent host
toxicity.

conclusion
in summary, six 2,4-diamino-6-(dibenz[b,f]azepin-5yl)methylpteridine analogues in which a 2′-(omega-carboxyalkyloxy) or a 2′-(4-carboxybenzyloxy) substituent has
been introduced in order to afford water solubility and
enhance dhfr affinity were synthesized and tested as
inhibitors of pc, tg, ma, and rat dhfr. 2,4diamino-6-[2′-o-(3′-carboxypropyl)oxydibenz[b,f]azepin-5-yl]methylpteridine (10) was an exceptionally potent and selective inhibitor of the pc enzyme, with an
ic50 of 1.1 nm and a selectivity of 1300 for the pc
enzyme versus the rat enzyme (ic50 ) 1500 nm). this
compound was likewise a good inhibitor of tg and ma

molecular modeling studies (by d. chan). computational simulations were performed using the molecular dynamics package amber 743 implementing the all-atom nonpolarizable ff99 force field44 based on the force field of cornell
and co-workers.45 molecular mechanics parameters for 10 and
nadph were not present in the standard amber database
and thus were derived using antechamber.46 am1-bcc
partial charges were obtained from mopac.47 formal charges
of -1 and -4 were assigned to 10 and nadph, respectively.
starting coordinates for the simulations were furnished by
least-squares superimposition of the pteridine moiety of 10
onto inhibitors displayed in previously reported ternary complexes of pc dhfr (pdb code: 1klk)23 and human dhfr
(pdb code: 1ohj)48 using the molecular graphics package
sybyl 6.9.39 the carboxyalkoxy side chain of 10 was manually
rotated to minimize steric clashes with the enzyme. all
crystallographically determined h2o molecules were retained

except two, which were removed from the active site in order
to accommodate the dibenz[b,f]azepine moiety. the ternary
complexes were solvated in tip3 h2o by adding a 10 å (pc
dhfr) or 9 å (human dhfr) shell around the solute, raising
the total number of h2o molecules in the system to 7262 and
8106, respectively. all molecular dynamics simulations were
unrestrained and began with a 2000-step energy minimization
protocol consisting of cycles of steepest descent minimization,
followed by conjugate gradient minimization to remove unfavorable contacts between the enzyme, nadph, and 10.
periodic boundary conditions with a nonbonded cutoff of 10 å
were applied. dynamics runs were 0.5 ns in length and had a
time step of 2 fs. the pressure was regulated at 1 atm, and
the temperature was maintained at 298 k with the exception
of the final 20 ps, when the system was cooled to 1 k over a
period of 10 ps. the shake algorithm49 was applied to
constrain bonds involving hydrogen at their equilibrium
values. at the end, the complexes were subjected to a 2000step energy minimization procedure.

2523. note that the si of compound 6, referred to as pt653 in
this paper, was inadvertently listed as 1.9, instead of 13.9 for
pc versus human dhfr. however, as evident from the ic50
values and the accompanying discussion, the potency and
selectivity of 6 for pc versus human and for pc versus rat dhfr
are very similar.
structural studies on rat dhfr by crystallography are in
progress in the laboratory of dr. vivian cody, hauptmanwoodward medical research institute, buffalo, ny.
