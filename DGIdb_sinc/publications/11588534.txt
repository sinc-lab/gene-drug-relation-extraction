summary: platelet deposition and aggregation are the major determinants of
acute thrombosis in coronary stents. we aimed to compare the antiplatelet
efficacy of different treatments—glycoprotein (gp) iib/iiia inhibitors and
conventional antiaggregants—in an experimental model for stenting. blood
samples were obtained from patients with coronary artery disease (n ⳱ 15)
and healthy volunteers (n ⳱ 8) and incubated either with  xxxd2017xxx  (2.0
␮g/ml),  xxxd53xxx  (3.0 ␮g/ml), indomethacin (15 ␮g/ml), or saline. platelet
 xxxd80xxx –induced aggregation in whole blood was assessed for
all groups. blood was also tested in an experimental circulation model containing metallic probes, on which platelet deposition in shear flow conditions
was assessed by means of fluorescent-labeled platelet-specific (anti- xxxg1210xxx 
and ib) antibodies.  xxxd2017xxx  and  xxxd53xxx , in comparison with indomethacin and no treatment, significantly reduced platelet aggregation (0, 0, 4, and
3 arbitrary units [au], respectively; p < 0.001), anti- xxxg1210xxx  (2.25, 1.83, 11.24,
and 13.42 counts per second [cps]/mg, respectively; p < 0.001), and anti-gpib
binding (0.61, 0.61, 1.00, and 1.83 cps/mg, respectively; p < 0.001). antigpiiia and anti-gpib binding were significantly correlated (r ⳱ 0.36; p <
0.01). patients showed a higher anti- xxxg1210xxx , but not anti-gpib binding, than
controls (8.43 versus 3.33 cps/mg; p < 0.01), irrespective of treatment. in
conclusion,  xxxd2017xxx  and  xxxd53xxx  show equivalent in vitro antiplatelet
efficacy, superior to that of indomethacin. given the occurrence of  xxxg1202xxx /iiia
platelet overexpression in the course of coronary artery disease, an extended
use of  xxxg1202xxx /iiia inhibitors may be proposed to prevent acute thrombosis
during routine coronary stenting. key words: platelets—inhibitors—
stents—coronary disease—receptors.

coronary stenting has progressively become a fundamental tool in the treatment of occlusive coronary artery
disease (cad) (1,2). however, thrombosis and occlusion
of the coronary artery can occur at an early stage after
stenting (3). prevention of stent thrombosis is mandatory, to decrease patients’ morbidity and mortality and
the cost of health care needed for reintervention (4,5).
conventional antiaggregant therapies (aspirin,  xxxd80xxx  [adp] receptor antagonists) have
proven to be effective in reducing thrombotic complications after coronary stenting (6,7). arterial thrombus formation depends mainly on deposition and subsequent
aggregation of circulating platelets on the damaged arterial wall and the implanted stent (8,9). although a targeted antagonism of the platelet glycoprotein (gp)
iib/iiia receptor clearly improves the clinical outcomes
after coronary stenting (10,11), the routine use of
 xxxg1202xxx /iiia inhibitors is still under debate (12). moreover,
currently available  xxxg1202xxx /iiia inhibitors express a wide
variability in pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics
(13,14) and, to date, only few studies have explored the
equivalency of these compounds during coronary interventions (15,16).
the objective of the current study was to compare the
efficacy of two different  xxxg1202xxx /iiia inhibitors, also
against conventional antiaggregant therapy, in inhibiting
platelet deposition and aggregation in an experimental
model for stenting.

methods
study drugs
the study represents an in vitro comparison of the
antiplatelet effects of  xxxd2017xxx  (integrilin, schering
plough bv, maarssen, the netherlands),  xxxd53xxx  (reopro, eli lilly bv, nieuwegein, the netherlands), and
indomethacin (fluka chemie ag, buchs, switzerland),
an i.v. aspirin-like drug.
blood sampling and preparation
blood samples were collected immediately before the
procedure at the university hospital of groningen, the
netherlands, from patients with cad undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention. exclusion criteria were
unstable angina or impending myocardial infarction, abnormal platelet count, use of anticoagulation therapy, or
international normalized ratio > 2.0. anticipating the potential implantation of a coronary stent, all patients had
received within 12 h prior to the procedure  xxxd3426xxx -mg
loading dose of clopidogrel bisulfate (plavix, sanofisynthelabo, paris, france), a novel thienopyridinic platej cardiovasc pharmacol™, vol. 38, no. 4, 2001

let adp receptor antagonist. all patients were already
receiving low-dose  xxxd234xxx  (100 mg/d).
blood samples were also collected from healthy volunteers. written informed consent for blood withdrawal
was obtained from all participants. blood from each individual was collected with ppack (calbiochem, la
jolla, ca, u.s.a.) as anticoagulant, at a concentration of
0.5 ␮g/ml, 9.5 ␮m. despite the hazard of excessive
sample anticoagulation, ppack was preferred to citrate,
which enhances the activity of  xxxd2017xxx  via ca2+
depletion (17). the final volume of the collected samples
was 30 ± 5 ml.
blood from each individual was separated into four
equal aliquots, to which medication or saline (no treatment) was added. selection of the final concentrations
for  xxxg1202xxx /iiia inhibitors was based on the known therapeutic active dose: for  xxxd2017xxx  (18) 2.0 ␮g/ml, and
for  xxxd53xxx  (10) 3.0 ␮g/ml. for indomethacin a concentration was chosen (15 ␮g/ml) to mimic the effect of
325 mg of oral  xxxd234xxx  (19). medications
were incubated with blood for 10 min at room temperature. subsequent analyses were performed by investigators blinded to treatment.
platelet aggregation
in vitro platelet aggregation was induced by adding to
whole blood adp (5 ␮m), which provokes platelet interaction via fibrinogen binding to  xxxg1202xxx /iiia receptors.
blood was equilibrated at 37°c for 2–5 min under constant stirring. platelet aggregation was measured by decrease of impedance on a dual-channel chrono-log aggregometer (havertown, pa, u.s.a.). curve heights of
the tracings generated by the apparatus (% of resistance
in ohm) for each experiment were classified into six
discrete categories of platelet aggregation, according to a
semiquantitative scale (range: 0–5 arbitrary units [au])
(table 1).

compared with both indomethacin and no treatment (p < 0.001).

platelet deposition
a standardized experimental model was used to reproduce platelet-stent interaction in shear flow conditions.
the system has been extensively described elsewhere
(20). briefly, it is composed of a closed-loop circuit
made of polyvinyl chloride tubing (3.0-mm inner diam-

eter), kept at 37°c, and a semiocclusive roller pump. a
stainless steel probe was inserted in the system, as a
model for coronary stent. probes (20-mm long, 3-mm
wide, and 0.2-mm thick) were cut from high-grade quality stainless steel flat sheets (aisi 316l; goodfellow
cambridge, london, u.k.), electropolished, cleansed by

ultrasonication, and rinsed in demineralized water and
95% methanol. blood was recirculated through the tubing for 15 min, at a flow rate of 40 ml/min; the steel
probe was then removed, gently washed in phosphatebuffered saline, and stored at −80°c.
human platelet-specific  xxxg1210xxx  ( xxxg1210xxx ) and gpib
(cd42b) antigen deposition on probes after circulation
was assessed by specific fluorescent-labeled antibodies
(dako a/s, glostrup, denmark). antibody labeling and
binding were performed as described elsewhere (21). results were corrected for controls, obtained by incubating
antibodies with nonrecirculated probes, and are expressed as counts of fluorescence per second, corrected
for milligrams of metal (cps/mg).
statistical analysis
because variables were predominantly not normally distributed, they are presented as median and range
(min-max). differences for blood donors (patients or
controls) were analyzed using wilcoxon two-sample
test/wilcoxon rank sum test, both irrespective of and
according to treatment. comparison between treatment
groups ( xxxd2017xxx ,  xxxd53xxx , indomethacin, no treatment) was performed using the friedman test for multiple comparisons for nonparametric randomized block
design. post hoc analysis was performed by bonferroni
test. spearman correlation analysis was performed for
variables showing statistically significant changes. all

statistical analyses were performed using sas, windows
version 6.12 (sas, cary, nc, u.s.a.).
results
blood was withdrawn from 15 patients with cad (11
men, mean age 61 years) and eight healthy volunteers
(seven men, mean age 42 years). however, blood from
two patients coagulated before proper aggregation tests;
thus 23 adhesion and 21 aggregation experiments, respectively, were performed for each experimental group.
both  xxxd2017xxx  and  xxxd53xxx  equally inhibited
adp-induced platelet aggregation in almost all samples
(0 [0–1] and 0 [0–3] au, respectively; p ⳱ 0.57), in
comparison with indomethacin (4 [0–5] au; p < 0.001
versus  xxxd2017xxx  and  xxxd53xxx ), which had almost no
effect, and no treatment (3 [0–5] au; p < 0.001 versus
 xxxd2017xxx  and  xxxd53xxx ). no differences between patients and controls were demonstrated (1 [0–5] and 2
[0–5] au; p ⳱ 0.20)(fig. 1).
anti- xxxg1210xxx  and anti-gpib binding onto steel probes
were significantly correlated (r ⳱ 0.36, p < 0.01)(fig.
2), as well as they were with adp-induced platelet aggregation (for anti- xxxg1210xxx  binding, r ⳱ 0.61; p <
0.001)(fig. 3).
when compared with indomethacin or no treatment,
 xxxd2017xxx  and  xxxd53xxx  induced an equal and significant reduction both of anti- xxxg1210xxx  binding (11.24 [4.16–

among samples incubated either with  xxxd2017xxx  or  xxxd53xxx , five of 26 from patients, but none from controls,
exceeded median values, either for platelet aggregation
or anti- xxxg1210xxx  binding (fig. 3).
irrespective of any treatment, patients’ samples
showed a significantly higher anti- xxxg1210xxx  binding than
controls (8.43 [−0.51–22.35] versus 3.33 [−2.27–17.82]

cps/mg, respectively; p < 0.01) (fig. 4), whereas no significant difference was found for anti-gpib binding (1.05
[−1.29–4.11] and 1.17 [−0.76–4.61] cps/mg, respectively; p ⳱ 0.70)(fig. 5).
discussion
as expected,  xxxd2017xxx  and  xxxd53xxx  exhibited an
equivalent in vitro efficacy in preventing adp-induced
platelet aggregation. in addition, both  xxxg1202xxx /iiia inhibitors reduced platelet deposition onto stent-like surfaces
exposed to blood shear flow, at a higher extent than an
aspirin-like treatment (indomethacin). cumulatively,
these data suggest a potential role for  xxxg1202xxx /iiia inhibitors in the prevention of platelet deposition, aggregation,
and subsequent thrombosis after coronary stenting.

with both indomethacin and no treatment (p < 0.001). experiments with blood from patients showed a higher anti- xxxg1210xxx  binding than
controls (p < 0.01).

previous studies have already demonstrated the involvement of activated platelet  xxxg1202xxx /iiia receptors, not
only in promoting aggregation (22) but also in mediating
platelet adhesion to fibrinogen-covered structures, as an
alternative to the well-established von willebrand factorgpib pathway (23–25). our results follow previous findings, which demonstrated that, under low shear flow,
anti- xxxg1202xxx /iiia antibodies ( xxxd53xxx  fabs) inhibit fibrinogen-mediated platelet adhesion (26). this capability is
acknowledged by the current study also for currently
available drugs, such  xxxd2017xxx  and  xxxd53xxx .
extending the role of  xxxg1202xxx /iiia inhibitors beyond
simply blocking platelet-to-platelet cohesion has important clinical implications. in fact, this treatment comes
forward as a definitive solution for the problem of stent
thrombosis. indeed, although convincing evidence has
already been reported that  xxxd53xxx  significantly rej cardiovasc pharmacol™, vol. 38, no. 4, 2001

duces 30 day-adverse events after stent placement (from
10.8–5.3%) (27),  xxxd2017xxx  has been acknowledged
only in a recent trial for the same results (from 10.5–
6.8%) (18). the clinical success of  xxxd53xxx  has been
also attributed to the additional blockade of nongpiib/iiia receptors, i.e.,  xxxg2422xxx  and mac-1. this
capability is not shown by  xxxd2017xxx , but it seems not
to influence drug effect on platelet adhesion to the fibrinogen-covered metallic surface, probably the major
determinant of thrombus formation in the immediate
phases after coronary stenting. our data then suggest
that, for preventing acute stent thrombosis,  xxxd2017xxx 
and  xxxd53xxx  could be administered with equivalent
results.
in our experimental model, an aspirin-like treatment
(indomethacin) was not as effective as  xxxg1202xxx /iiia inhibitors in achieving platelet inhibition. this finding appears

median values for treatment subgroups (white boxes), total of patients (black box), and controls (gray box) are also reported. units are
counts of fluorescence per second/mg of metal (cps/mg).  xxxd2017xxx  and  xxxd53xxx  provoked a significant reduction compared with both

particularly relevant in patients, who, unlike controls,
were also receiving clopidogrel. in fact, a front-load dose
of this compound, followed by a 28-day administration,
has recently been proposed as the antithrombotic treatment of choice after stenting (28,29). instead, considering also that the adverse event rate after stenting seems
not to increase after the first 48 h (10,18),  xxxg1202xxx /iiia
inhibitors, administered at the time of intervention, could
be proposed as a self-sufficient therapy. patients in our
study, however, could have profited by an additional
platelet inhibition, provided by clopidogrel. moreover,
experimental studies have demonstrated that adp inhibitors enhance the platelet blockade of  xxxg1202xxx /iiia inhibitors (30). thus a combined strategy (parenteral

 xxxg1202xxx /iiia inhibitors during and oral antiaggregants before and after stenting) could be advisable.
in the current study, tests with blood from patients, in
comparison with controls and regardless of any antiplatelet treatment, resulted in an increased anti- xxxg1210xxx , but not
anti-gpib, binding onto metallic probes. these data confirm an altered expression of surface platelet antigens in
the course of cad. a reduced expression of gpib receptors (e.g., by cleavage or internalization), partly concealing an increased platelet deposition, cannot be excluded a priori. however, cad poorly influences gpib
expression, and only in parallel with that of  xxxg1202xxx /iiia
receptor (31). instead, atherosclerosis and stable cad
can induce the overexpression of surface receptors, parj cardiovasc pharmacol™, vol. 38, no. 4, 2001

ticularly those (like  xxxg1202xxx /iiia receptor) involved in the
process of platelet activation (32,33). then, although
anti-gpib binding could be considered as a relatively
constant indicator of platelet deposition, instead, to explain the increased anti- xxxg1210xxx  binding found in the current study, we hypothesize an increased expression of
activated  xxxg1202xxx /iiia receptor (e.g., by externalization or
structural changes) on platelets from patients with cad.
whether this phenomenon was already present, or developed only after interaction with stent-like surfaces
(34,35), could not be determined. nevertheless, gawaz
et al. (8) found that the relative risk of stent thrombosis
is 18.5-fold for patients with enhanced  xxxg1202xxx /iiia surface
expression. additionally,  xxxg1202xxx /iiia receptor expression
manifests a wide interindividual variability (36) (e.g., by
genetic polymorphisms). this is probably exacerbated,
and can assume clinical relevance, in the presence of
cad, as, in the current study, a variability in the response to  xxxg1202xxx /iiia inhibitors was demonstrated only
among patients but not healthy controls (fig. 3). extended  xxxg1202xxx /iiia receptor blockade in candidates for
routine coronary stenting could then offer a broad protection against unexpected acute thrombotic complications.
study limitations
in the current study a single concentration of both
 xxxd2017xxx  and  xxxd53xxx  was used; thus a doseresponse curve could not be drawn. potential differences
in drug availability and distribution between in vivo and
in vitro conditions should also be considered. finally,
gender and age bias, risk factors, or concomitant medications could have induced differences in platelet receptor expression between patients and controls.
conclusion
 xxxd2017xxx  and  xxxd53xxx  at therapeutic concentrations
exhibit an equivalent in vitro efficacy in inhibiting platelet
aggregation and deposition on stent-like surfaces.
considering the occurrence of  xxxg1202xxx /iiia-receptor
overexpression in the course of cad, and the incomplete
blockade achieved by conventional antiplatelet therapy
(aspirin-like and adp inhibitors), an extended use of
these compounds may be justified to prevent acute
thrombosis in candidates for routine coronary stenting.
however, the enforcement in clinical practice of this
policy will require further investigations, taking into account also safety and economic profiles of different
 xxxg1202xxx /iiia inhibitors.
