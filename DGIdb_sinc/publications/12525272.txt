the ergot alkaloids were the first specific  xxxd2022xxx 
therapy available. however, with the advent of the triptans,
their use in the treatment of migraine has declined and
their role has become less clear. this review discusses the
pharmacology, efficacy, and safety of the ergots. in randomized clinical trials, oral ergotamine was found to be superior to placebo, but inferior to 100 mg of oral sumatriptan.
in contrast, rectal ergotamine was found to have higher efficacy (73%  xxxd234xxx ) than rectal sumatriptan (63%
 xxxd234xxx ). intranasal dihydroergotamine was found
to be superior to placebo, but less effective than subcutaneous and intranasal sumatriptan. ergotamine is still widely
used in some countries for the treatment of severe
migraine attacks. it is generally regarded as a safe and useful
drug if prescribed for infrequent use, in the correct dose,
and in the absence of contraindications; however, safer and
more effective options do exist in the triptans. in patients
with status migrainous and patients with frequent headache
recurrence, ergotamine is still probably useful.

introduction
in the middle ages, grain contaminated with ergot (claviceps purpurea) caused epidemics of gangrene known as
“st. anthony's fire” [1]. ergotamine, one of the ergot alkaloids mainly responsible for this effect, was isolated from
ergot in 1918 and introduced in migraine therapy in 1926
as a sympatholytic drug [2•]. in 1938, graham and wolff
[3] concluded that the efficacy of ergotamine probably
resulted from vasoconstriction of the extracranial vasculature. in 1945, dihydroergotamine (dhe) was introduced
in migraine therapy as a more potent sympatholytic agent
than ergotamine [2•].
the vasoconstrictor activity of these ergot alkaloids initially was thought to be the mode of action in migraine pain,
although other possible mechanisms for the beneficial effect
of ergot alkaloids are now thought to be more likely,

including an effect on neurogenic inflammation [4,5] and an
action on central serotonergic neurons [6,7••,8,9].
the ergot alkaloids, obtained from naturally occurring
ergot, are a family of interrelated molecular entities that
share the ergoline ring system [10] (fig. 1). the earliest
ergot formulations were simple fluid extracts; some were
very potent and others were practically inert, owing to differential extraction of active substances and the instability
of the compounds in an alkaline solution [11]. the extract
was injected or administered orally, although the superiority of parenteral administration was noted [11,12].
the ergot alkaloids were the first specific anti-migraine
therapy to be available. with the advent of the triptans,
their use in the treatment of migraines has declined and
their role has become less clear. this review discusses the
pharmacology, efficacy, and safety of the ergots.

mechanism of action
ergotamine consists of a natural d-lysergic acid (the
ergoline ring) linked to a tricyclic peptide by a peptide
bond (fig. 1). only e isomers, which are derivatives of the
natural d-lysergic acid, have pharmacologic importance.
the most important and conspicuous pharmacologic
effect of ergot alkaloids is undeniably the vasoconstrictor
action. despite its unclear role in therapeutic function, the
vasoconstrictive property has had major importance in the
potential adverse effects of these drugs [13].
the ergot alkaloids interact with multiple receptors,
but receptor access is organ specific. the receptor affinity
and efficacy (intrinsic activity) vary as a function of structural configuration.
 xxxd2022xxx  (et) and dhe are structurally
related to the biogenic amines (norepinephrine [ne], epinephrine, dopamine [da], and serotonin [5-ht]). this catecholamine structural similarity allows the ergots to
interact with naturally occurring biogenic amine receptors.
the ergot alkaloids have a long duration of action
despite their rapid clearance from plasma. thus, their
plasma levels do not directly correlate with their biologic
activity [10–12].
dihydroergotamine and et can cause vasoconstriction by
stimulating omicron-adrenergic and 5-ht receptors, although et is a
more potent vasoconstrictor. both can inhibit the actions ne
and 5-ht. they are both venoconstrictors [11,12].

there are multiple 5-ht receptors with varied biologic
effects [11,12]. at least seven classes of 5-ht receptors exist
(table 1): the inhibitory 5-ht1 receptor, in part, modulates
neurotransmitter release presynaptically; the 5-ht2, 5-ht3,
 xxxg1117xxx ,  xxxg1119xxx , and 5-ht7 receptors are excitatory. all of the
5-ht receptors are linked to g proteins, except for the 5ht3 receptor, which is linked to an ion channel.
evidence for the involvement of 5-ht in headache is
based on the pharmacologic observation that reserpine,
which depletes central nervous system 5-ht, precipitates a
headache that can be relieved by 5-ht, its precursors, and
5-ht agonists. in addition to their actions on the adrenergic and dopaminergic receptor systems, et and dhe have
affinity for the  xxxg1108xxx , 5-ht1b,  xxxg1110xxx , 5-ht21f, 5-ht2a
(d),  xxxg1115xxx , and 5-ht3 (m) receptor sub-types [13]. triptans bind only to 5-ht1b, d, and f receptors; thus et and
dhe are far “dirtier” drugs and less “designer” in receptor
profile binding than triptans, which is to be expected
because of the ergots’ provenance from rye mold. table 1
provides a summary of the various receptor classes and
subtypes with which et and dhe interact.
understanding the mechanisms of action of ergot
derivatives in migraine can be achieved partly by understanding the pathophysiology of migraine. multiple
threads of research over the past 15 years have led to the
concept that migraine develops from a hyperexcitable
brain [14–16]. although we do not know if migraine is
generated in the cortex or in the brainstem, one possible
scenario would include a cascade of events beginning with
cortical activation, followed by brainstem activation,
which leads to activation of ascending and descending
pathways, with the initiation of a perimeningeal vasodilatation and neurogenic inflammation [14,15,17,18].
experimental neurogenic inflammation results in leakage of plasma protein into the dura mater, which can be
quantified by measuring the leakage of radioactive albumin. stimulation of the trigeminal nerve in rats produces
neurogenic inflammation and albumin leakage on the
stimulated side. the trigeminal nerve terminal has
prejunctional 5-ht1 heteroreceptors. the ergot alkaloids

are 5-ht1 receptor agonists that block the release of neuropeptide mediators ( xxxg2240xxx  and calcitonin generelated peptide [cgrp]) that could produce or exacerbate
the pain and vasodilatation of migraine [19]. administration of dhe, a 5-ht1 agonist, prevents albumin leakage
and inhibits the expression of c-fos-like activity (a marker
for activated cells secondary to intense neuronal stimulation) in the trigeminal nucleus caudalis. c-fos is a nuclear
phosphoprotein that regulates gene expression.
neurogenic inflammation can be prevented by blocking
neuronal transmission, thereby providing a mechanism of
action for acute headache medications independent of the
vascular effects [10]. these observations are relevant to
migraine because elevated cgrp levels have been found in
human jugular blood during a migraine attack and because
5-ht1 agonists (eg, dhe and sumatriptan) abort the headache and reduce cgrp to control levels.
the  xxxd2022xxx  action of ergot alkaloids, including
et and dhe, may involve effects on a receptor-mediated
neural pathway in the central nervous system and on the
trigeminal nerve terminal. in cats, dhe has been shown to
distribute into the nuclei in the brain stem and spinal cord,
which are closely involved with pain transmission and
modulation [20].

pharmacokinetics of ergotamine and
dihydroergotamine
there is poor correlation between et and dhe plasma
concentrations and their pharmacologic activity. the
effects of ergot alkaloids persist for much longer than the
parent drugs can be detected in plasma [21–23].
with tritium-labeled et, 66% of the orally administered et was absorbed; however, it was shown that the oral
bioavailability of et was less than 1% [24]. thus, even if et
is well absorbed, most of the drug is metabolized during
the first pass through the liver [8].
after intravenous (iv) injection, et is distributed
quickly, with a half-life from 2 to 3 minutes and an elimination half-life of 2 hours. the intramuscular (im) bioavailability is approximately 50% and the peak plasma
concentration is seen after 10 minutes. it is almost impossible to detect et after other routes of administration.

ergotamine and dihydroergotamine: a review • bigal and tepper

 xxxd2022xxx  is extensively metabolized by the
liver [22]. after oral administration, it is rapidly cleared
from the blood by first-pass hepatic metabolism. et and its
metabolites are excreted principally in the feces through
biliary elimination (greater than 90%). only a small
amount of unchanged drug is excreted in the urine. enterohepatic recirculation has been suggested by some studies.
oral dhe has a lower bioavailability (less than 1%)
than et because of incomplete drug passage across the gastrointestinal mucosa and a high first-pass metabolism
[25], contrasting with the absolute bioavailability of im
dhe (100%) [25]. the absolute bioavailability of dhe
after intranasal (in) administration is approximately 40%
[26]. peak plasma levels occur approximately 1 to 2 minutes after iv administration, 24 minutes after im administration, and 30 to 60 minutes after in administration.
intranasal administration of dhe [27] avoids first-pass
hepatic metabolism.
the distribution of dhe is very poor. the metabolism
is hepatic. only 6% to 7% of an im dose is excreted in the
urine. the major route of elimination is the feces after biliary excretion of unchanged drug and metabolites. dhe
has many metabolites, some of them active, with an effect
similar to that of the parent compound. [26]. the apparent
dissociation between plasma concentrations of the parent
drug and the observed biologic effects may reflect the presence of active metabolites and tight tissue binding.

the clinical role of  xxxd2022xxx 
 xxxd2022xxx  was introduced in the 1920s for the
treatment of vascular headaches, which are known as
migraine or cluster headaches today. since that time, et
has consistently proven to be somewhat effective in the
treatment of moderate to severe migraine [27–30]. a variety of dosage forms have been employed to optimize the
administration of et in different clinical situations;
because of the variability in bioavailability, the optimal
route of administration should be tested before concluding
that a patient is not responding to the drug.
rectal suppositories, available only in combination
with caffeine, provide more rapid and consistent absorption and onset of action than oral or sublingual tablets.
the addition of caffeine or belladonna to et preparations
may enhance effectiveness. caffeine likely has some mild
analgesic properties and enhances the absorption of orally
administered et. belladonna alkaloids may help lessen the
nausea in some patients. the effectiveness of et depends
partly on the delivery [30].
oral tablets
the poor bioavailability limits the clinical use of oral tablets [31]. oral et is appropriate for patients with slowly
evolving migraine without early onset nausea.
patients should take one 1-mg tablet at the start of an
attack, with a maximum total dose of 6 mg per attack. even

57

this dose, which is the smallest available in the united
states, often can cause nausea. nausea may be a marker for
a dose that is too high; however, the et available in the
united states is not scored or broken into smaller doses,
further limiting clinical usefulness. taking the et before
migraine nausea has begun with its associated gastric stasis
is critical for using the oral formulation. in some south
american countries, such as brazil, et is marketed commonly with an antiemetic and caffeine (in the same tablet)
to prevent nausea and increase the absorption and antimigrainous effect.
efficacy and tolerability are highly dependent on the
patient, so each patient's therapy is tailored to the
response. patients should not take more than 10 mg
weekly. however, more important than total dosage is to
limit the use of et to 2 or fewer days per week (this can be
relaxed in cluster headaches), with an interval of at least 4
days in between usage days to prevent drug-induced
headache [32], which is extremely common with frequent
et usage.
daily oral et is appropriate for the prophylaxis of cluster headache. the patient should be instructed to take one
1-mg tablet in the morning if necessary and a second tablet
in the evening during the cluster period. patients are
advised to discontinue the daily et therapy after they have
been free of headache for 2 weeks [30].
that et works best with a nocturnal dose and is only
available in the united states combined with caffeine,
which can cause insomnia. another problem is that international regulatory agencies, including the food and drug
administration, contraindicate combining ergots and triptans in the same day. also, injectable sumatriptan is the
treatment of choice for aborting clusters among international regulatory agencies. thus, patients on daily et cannot use sumatriptan rescue. however, they can safely use
oxygen to abort cluster if they are taking et.
rectal suppositories
this form is another alternative in the united states
because of the poor bioavailability of the oral form. the
suppository yields higher plasma levels of et and greater
efficacy than oral tablets. this delivery is specifically useful
in patients with early onset of migraine with severe nausea
or vomiting.
according to mathew [30], the likelihood of drug-associated nausea, which is a frequent side-effect of ergotamine, or vomiting can be reduced through determination
of a subnauseating dose of et suppository. the patients are
instructed to cut the suppositories; subnauseating doses
may range from one half of a suppository (1 mg) to as little
as one eighth of a suppository (0.25 mg) [28]. if an attack
develops, the patient should administer the subnauseating
dose immediately. again, the dose required to achieve the
desired response will vary from patient to patient, but up
to two suppositories (4 mg) per attack may be necessary. as
with oral dosing, the maximum total dose of et should

58

advancements in the pharmacologic treatment of headache

not exceed 10 mg weekly [30,32], and limiting administration to no more than 1 to 2 days of usage weekly is critical
to avoiding habituation, rebound, and daily headache.

the clinical role of dihydroergotamine
dihydroergotamine is an advance beyond et in treating
migraine with or without aura, status migrainous, chronic
daily headache (transformed or chronic migraine), and
cluster headaches [30]. dhe causes substantially less nausea and vomiting, and is a more potent alpha -adrenergic
blocker than et [33,34]. additionally, headache recurrence
is low and infrequent [35,36] and rebound headache is
much less common with dhe.
clinically, dhe has been proven to be highly effective in treating acute migraine with or without aura [37–
39] and may be administered at any time during the
attack, including the aura, in contrast to the triptans.
repetitive iv dhe is a treatment of choice for status
migrainous [28] and is particularly effective for the treatment of chronic daily headache (transformed or chronic
migraine) and analgesic rebound headache. repetitive iv
dhe also is effective for the treatment of acute cluster
headache and for breaking the cycle of cluster headaches,
which may occur three or four times daily for several
weeks [40].
intravenous administration
the iv delivery of dhe was reviewed by mathew [30].
plasma levels of dhe are achieved within 1 to 2 minutes of
iv injection, providing a rapid onset of  xxxd234xxx  [10].
before receiving iv dhe, these patients ideally should be
pretreated with an iv anti-emetic, a neuroleptic (eg,
promethazine or  xxxd3018xxx ), or a 5-ht3 antagonist
(eg, ondansetron), and should be rehydrated with iv fluids. a heparin lock should be in place for the administration of repetitive doses of iv dhe. five to 30 minutes after
the patient is premedicated, a test dose of 0.33 or 0.5 mg of
dhe should be administered over a period of 2 to 3 minutes. if the patient has tolerated the test dose after 10 minutes with no nausea, vomiting, chest pain, or other adverse
events, the remaining 0.67 or 0.5 mg of dhe is administered. a total dhe dose of 1 ml (1 mg) is highly effective
for an acute attack in most patients.
status migrainous can be managed according to a modification of raskin's protocol [41] (fig. 2). patients with
status migrainous must be hydrated and should receive an
iv antiemetic, such as 10 mg of iv metoclopramide in 50
ml of dextrose 5% injection administered over 30 minutes. extrapyramidal side effects have been observed in
some patients receiving neuroleptics; therefore,
ondansetron can be substituted.
a 0.5-mg test dose of iv dhe is then administered over
1 minute. signs of intolerance to dhe include increased
blood pressure or chest pain; the few patients who experience these reactions should not continue on dhe. the

majority of patients will tolerate the dhe test dose and
will be able to continue.
patients reporting improvement can continue to
receive metoclopramide with 0.5 mg dhe, or the next dose
of dhe can be decreased to 0.25 mg. for patients with persistent headache but no nausea, the next dhe dose can be
increased to 1 mg 60 minutes after the test dose. the
patients continuing on therapy should receive dhe every 8
hours until the headache is eliminated, then switched to
an every 12-hour schedule for an additional two or three
doses, with metoclopramide administered as needed. the
usual recommended period of repetitive iv dhe treatment
is 72 hours.
repetitive dosing of iv dhe has been proven to be
highly effective in patients with refractory headaches. in
several studies, approximately 90% of patients with severe
and refractory migraine, chronic daily, or cluster headache
became symptom-free within 48 to 72 hours after starting
dhe therapy. the most common side effects (nausea, diarrhea, tightness and burning, leg cramps, and vomiting)
usually resolved spontaneously with downward dose
adjustment of dhe or adjunctive therapy [42].
intramuscular administration
dihydroergotamine may be administered im in an office setting. administration of dhe by the im route provides lower
level of nausea compared with the iv route [43]. the patient
will need training to self-administer dhe by im injection,
starting with a single im injection of i ml (1 mg) of dhe,
which may be repeated if needed after 60 minutes. with
some experience, patients may find that they need less than 1
mg to obtain the desired relief. in any case, the maximum
recommended daily dose for an individual attack is 3 ml (3
mg), with a maximum of 20 mg weekly. studies published in
the 1990s have shown comparable efficacy between subcutaneous and im administrations. we also have found anecdotally that patients can mix their dhe with 0.25–0.5 cm3 of
1% to 2% lidocaine in the same syringe (they are miscible)
to reduce injection site burning.
intranasal administration
theoretically, this route is the most convenient; however,
the intranasal dhe device available in the united states is
difficult to use correctly. the relative absolute bioavailability of intranasal dhe is lower than it is after im administration. however, intranasal dhe appears to be an effective
therapy for acute migraine with or without aura, especially
in patients with associated nausea or vomiting because it
bypasses the gastrointestinal tract.
dosing of intranasal dhe is one spray (0.5 mg) into
each nostril (without sniffing) at the first sign of migraine,
followed 15 minutes later by an additional spray into each
nostril. thus, the total dose administered is 2 mg in four
sprays. the maximum recommended dose is 4 mg for each
attack [30]. figure 3 summarizes the relative absorption
and onset of action of et and dhe.

results of randomized clinical trials with
ergotamine and dihydroergotamine
the recent clinical trials of et and dhe were reviewed by
tfelt-hansen [7••] and are presented here. in randomized,
clinical trials (rcts) that are generally not carried out with
current methodology, oral et (1–5 mg) has shown superiority to placebo [44•]. the clinical relevance of the different efficacy parameters used in the old studies can be
questioned, and no uniform picture of the effectiveness of
oral et emerges from these rcts. in recent rcts, 2 mg of
et plus 200 mg of caffeine were found to be inferior to 100
mg of sumatriptan [44•], and the rather small dose of 1 mg
of et plus 100 mg of caffeine was inferior to the combination of calcium carbasalate (equivalent to 900 mg aspirin)
plus 10 mg of metoclopramide [44•].
the rectal route of administration of et, which should
be more efficacious from a kinetic point of view, has
scarcely been investigated [7••,44•]. in a recent randomized, cross-over, double-blind trial including 251 patients
[45], et plus caffeine suppositories (2 mg plus 200 mg)
and one optional suppository after 30 minutes were superior to 25-mg sumatriptan suppositories, with response
rates of 73% and 63% after 2 hours and recurrence rates of
11% and 22%, respectively. because there were more side
effects after the use of et (27%) than after sumatriptan
(8%), slightly more patients preferred sumatriptan (44%)
than et (36%).
intravenous dhe was compared with placebo in one
rct, and the results indicated superiority of dhe [46].

intranasal dhe was compared with placebo in several
rcts with variable results [47]. an overview of four more
recent rcts using current methodology with intranasal
and subcutaneous dhe is shown in table 2.

safety profiles
after a single dose of et and dhe, the side effects include
nausea and vomiting, abdominal discomfort, acroparesthesia, and leg cramps [49]. in patients with ischemic heart
disease, et, administered in therapeutic doses, has caused
variant angina, myocardial infarction, and cardiac arrest in
a few patients [50]. after chronic daily intake, unwanted
symptoms include those attributed to vasospasm (eg, intermittent claudication) and et-induced headache [1].
any medication used for the treatment of migraine
attacks probably can be misused if they are taken daily or
almost daily. migraine can evolve into chronic daily headache with et rebound headache if patients with migraine
take et more than 1 to 2 days weekly.
although dhe and et effectively relieve migraine pain,
a review of their published pharmacologic and safety data
shows significant clinical differences between the two
(table 2). et probably is a stronger arterial vasoconstrictor
than dhe, although the two agents are nearly equipotent
as venoconstrictors [51]. both agents induce a much more
prolonged coronary constriction than triptans, persisting
even after repeated washing of the vessels [52]. however,
dhe has somewhat stronger alpha -adrenergic antagonist

activity. et is much more likely to produce nausea and
vomiting, uterine effects, and rebound headache [52]. coadministration of antiemetics with im dhe is unnecessary
because they do not appear to reduce nausea more than
dhe alone does [52].
contraindications for dhe and et are a consequence
of their adverse effect profiles. they include pregnancy,
renal or hepatic failure, coronary, cerebral, and peripheral
vascular disease, hypersensitivity reactions, sepsis, and
uncontrolled hypertension [51,53,54]. ergots should not
be administered to patients who are likely to have asymptomatic coronary artery disease based on risk factor profiles without an adequate workup. caution is advised in
patients with basilar or hemiplegic migraine or migraine
with prolonged aura. co-administration of triacetyloleandomycin or erythromycin also is relatively contraindicated
because these antibiotics may decrease the metabolism of
dhe or et and thus increase plasma levels. the degradation of ergots by  xxxg590xxx  (cyp3a4) in the
liver leads to a contraindication for ergot use with all macrolide antibiotics or other potent cyp3a4 inhibitors
[51,53,54].
regarding et, special caution is suggested regarding
concomitant use of  xxxd2621xxx  and triptans based on
studies reporting an increased risk of vasospasm [49]. beta
blockers also should be avoided because they could theoretically increase the alpha-adrenergic vasoconstrictive properties of dhe and et [54].
 xxxd2022xxx  also is contraindicated in patients
with prolonged aura or vertebrobasilar migraine because
of the possibility of frank migrainous infarction.
migraine, especially migraine with prolonged aura, is a
risk factor for stroke, particularly in young women; there-

fore, distinguishing drug-attributable and disease-attributable cerebral infarction may be difficult [55]. dhe has
not been reported to lengthen or aggravate the aura and
can be administered during the aura if necessary.
the vasospastic effects of et should not be underestimated. in addition to myocardial infarction, et has been
associated with claudication, gangrene, and ischemia of
the extremities [56].
 xxxd2022xxx  has been associated with multiple
case reports of fibrotic complications. these are serotonergic
idiosyncratic reactions and can occur in the pericardium, coronary ostia and valves, lung, and retroperitoneum. chronic
use of et suppositories also has been associated with rectal
fibrosis [56].
 xxxd2022xxx -induced rebound headache is considered by many headache specialists to be the most difficult form of chronic migraine with medication overuse to
treat because withdrawal of the et invariably induces
severe headache and withdrawal symptoms. most patients
with et rebound require hospitalization to detoxify. to
make matters worse, the number of days of weekly et
usage necessary to trigger rebound is low— probably only
1 to 2 days [57].

conclusions
in rcts, oral ergotamine was found to be superior to placebo, but inferior to 100 mg of oral sumatriptan. in contrast, rectal ergotamine was found to have higher efficacy
(73%  xxxd234xxx ) than rectal sumatriptan (63%
 xxxd234xxx ). intranasal dhe was found to be superior to placebo, but less effective than subcutaneous and
intranasal sumatriptan.

ergotamine and dihydroergotamine: a review • bigal and tepper

in general, the use of the more specific drugs, the triptans, which cause less adverse events and are more effective, is preferable to the use of the ergotamine in the acute
treatment of migraine. if ergotamine is to be used, the rectal route is preferable. the rectal dose of ergotamine
should be tailored to each patient.
the intranasal dose of dhe, between 1 and 2 mg, also
should be tailored to each patient. to avoid drug-induced
headache, ergotamine and dhe should not be used daily.
ergotamine is still widely used in some countries for
the treatment of severe migraine attacks. it is generally
regarded as a safe and useful drug if prescribed in the correct dose infrequently, and in the absence of contraindications. however, there is consensus among european and
south american headache experts that for most patients
with migraine patients who require a specific  xxxd2022xxx 
treatment, a  xxxd3263xxx  is generally a better option than ergotamine from an efficacy and side-effect standpoint. headache recurrence probably is less likely with ergotamine
than with triptans. for patients with long attacks (more
than 48 hours) and those with frequent headache recurrence, ergotamine probably is useful.
no similar consensus has been reached for dhe, which
generally results in fewer side-effects than ergotamine [7••].
the potential of ergots for vascular side effects (eg, nausea, and development of rebound), added to their pharmacologic “dirty profile” and the prohibition of using them in
association with triptans, suggests that clinicians should
avoid ergotamine use for patients in favor of triptans.
