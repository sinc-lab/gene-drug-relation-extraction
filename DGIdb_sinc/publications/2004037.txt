soft drugs--10. blanching activity and receptor binding affinity of a new type of glucocorticoid:  xxxd2509xxx  etabonate.  an improved synthesis of  xxxd2509xxx  etabonate (chloromethyl 17 alpha-ethoxycarbonyloxy-11 beta-hydroxy-3-oxoandrosta-1,4-diene 17 beta-carboxylate) was achieved. the design of the new type of glucocorticoid was based on the soft drug concept. the relative binding affinities of  xxxd2509xxx  and its putative metabolites (pj90 and pj91) to rat lung type ii  xxxg1601xxx  were determined in a competitive binding experiment with [3h]triamicinolone acetonide. the medium contained cortienic acid (10(-5) m) in order to block transcortin binding sites.  xxxd2509xxx  etabonate exhibited a binding affinity which was 4.3 times that of dexamethasone, both compounds having a hill factor close to 1 whereas pj90 and pj91 did not show any affinity to the receptor.  xxxd2509xxx  etabonate was compared to betamethasone 17 alpha-valerate in a vasoconstriction test which was performed on the forearm skin of human volunteers. the results showed that  xxxd2509xxx  etabonate has good skin-permeation properties and strong glucocorticoid activity.
