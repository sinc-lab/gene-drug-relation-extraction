abstract
until recently, three classes of medical therapy were
available for the treatment of pulmonary arterial
hypertension (pah)—prostanoids, endothelin receptor
antagonists and phosphodiesterase type 5 (pde5)
inhibitors. with the approval of the soluble guanylate
cyclase stimulator  xxxd3127xxx , an additional drug class has
become available targeting a distinct molecular target in
the same pathway as pde5 inhibitors. treatment
recommendations currently include the use of all four
drug classes to treat pah, but there is a lack of
comparative data for these therapies. therefore, an
understanding of the mechanistic differences between
these agents is critical when making treatment decisions.
combination therapy is often used to treat pah and it is
therefore important that physicians understand how the
modes of action of these drugs may interact to work as
complementary partners, or potentially with unwanted
consequences. furthermore, different patient phenotypes
mean that patients respond differently to treatment;
while a certain monotherapy may be adequate for some
patients, for others it will be important to consider
alternating or combining compounds with different
molecular targets. this review describes how the four
currently approved drug classes target the complex
pathobiology of pah and will consider the distinct target
molecules of each drug class, their modes of action, and
review the pivotal clinical trial data supporting their use.
it will also discuss the rationale for combining drugs (or
not) from the different classes, and review the clinical
data from studies on combination therapy.

pulmonary arterial hypertension (pah) is a chronic,
potentially fatal disease characterised haemodynamically by increased mean pulmonary artery pressure
≥25 mm hg, normal pulmonary artery wedge pressure ≤15 mm hg and elevated pulmonary vascular
resistance (pvr) >3 wood units. pah is caused by
progressive remodelling of the pulmonary vasculature by cell proliferation and ﬁbrosis, occluding the
blood vessels and ultimately leading to right ventricular failure and death.1–3 the vascular pathology
of pah results at least in part from endothelial cell
dysfunction, accompanied by impaired signalling in
several pathways.4–9 despite advances in current
therapies for pah, there is still a signiﬁcant unmet
medical need, as the mortality of patients with pah
remains high.10–12
until recently, three classes of medical therapy
were available for the treatment of pah targeting
three dysfunctional pathways—prostanoids, endothelin receptor antagonists (eras) and phosphodiesterase type 5 (pde5) inhibitors. with the approval of
the soluble  xxxg1587xxx  (sgc) stimulator

 xxxd3127xxx ,13–16 a new, fourth class of therapy has
become available, targeting the same pathway as
pde5 inhibitors. the treatment algorithm discussed
at the 5th world symposium on pulmonary
hypertension (ph)17 recommends the use of all four
drug classes to treat pah (table 1), as do the recently
published chest guidelines on pharmacological
therapy for pah in adults (table 2).18 however, there
is a lack of comparative data for these therapies;
therefore, an understanding of the mechanistic differences between these agents and the clinical data sets
supporting their use is critical when making treatment decisions.
inter-individual differences mean that patients
can respond differently to the same pah treatment.
monotherapy may be adequate for some patients,
while others may only improve when treated with a
combination of two or three different classes of
drugs. although it is unclear whether these patients
are beneﬁting from combination therapy, or
whether the use of more than one drug is increasing the patient’s chances of receiving the treatment
to which they are most responsive, for patients who
receive combination therapy, it is important to consider alternating or combining compounds with different molecular targets. combination therapy is
often used to treat pah and it is important, therefore, that physicians understand how the modes of
action of these drugs might result in additive, synergistic or antagonistic interactions which could
lead to differences in safety and efﬁcacy.
this review will give a comprehensive overview
of the available approved medical treatments for
pah, describing how each drug class targets the
complex pathobiology of pah, and will consider
the distinct target molecules of each drug class. we
will also discuss the rationale for combination
therapy and review the clinical evidence for the use
of combination therapy.

currently approved therapies and their
molecular targets
the modes of action of the approved classes of
therapy for pah are illustrated in ﬁgure 1. key
positive clinical trial data for each therapy are summarised in tables 3 and 4.

 xxxd2331xxx  is a carbacyclin analogue of pgi2 that has improved stability at room temperature and a longer half-life (20–30 min) compared with epoprostenol. it can be administered intravenously or
by inhalation. inhaled  xxxd2331xxx  is approved in the usa for patients
with pah in who fc ii or iii, and in europe and several other
countries for patients with pah in who fc iii. details of the
air study of inhaled  xxxd2331xxx  are listed in table 3. intravenous  xxxd2331xxx  treatment has been evaluated in several open-label uncontrolled clinical studies, however not in a randomised controlled
clinical trial, and is only approved in new zealand for pah.

and in europe for patients with pah in who fc iii.
intravenous  xxxd3415xxx  should be reserved for patients who are
intolerant of the subcutaneous route, patients with a preference
for intravenous administration, or in whom the risks are considered warranted. inhaled and oral  xxxd3415xxx  are only approved
in the usa, and oral  xxxd3415xxx  is only approved in
treatment-naïve patients with pah, whereas inhaled  xxxd3415xxx 
is only approved for use in combination therapy. details of the

blockade of endothelin receptors
 xxxg674xxx  (et-1) is a potent vasoconstrictor and promoter of
pulmonary artery smooth muscle cell proliferation51 which is
upregulated in pah.52 there are two et-1 receptor subtypes:
endothelin receptors a (etar) and b ( xxxg677xxx ). etar is highly
expressed in vsmcs and contributes to et-1-induced contraction and proliferation of vsmcs in pah.53 54  xxxg677xxx  is predominantly expressed in vascular endothelial cells where activation
with et-1 promotes vasodilation through accelerated production of pgi2 and  xxxd2738xxx  (no) and clearance of et-1,55–57
but is also expressed in vsmcs, where it has vasoconstrictive
and proliferative actions.55 et receptors are also upregulated in
pah.51 the dual eras  xxxd358xxx  and  xxxd2529xxx , and the selective etar antagonist  xxxd138xxx  bind and block the et receptors, preventing et-1-mediated responses.

 xxxd358xxx 
 xxxd358xxx  is a dual era, administered orally. it is approved for
the treatment of patients with pah in who fc ii–iv in the usa
and several other regions, and in patients in who fc ii–iii in
europe. it may be associated with increased levels of liver transaminases; therefore patients are started on a low dose, which is
up-titrated to the therapeutic dose as long as liver transaminase
levels remain normal. monthly monitoring of liver transaminases
is mandatory for patients taking  xxxd358xxx .58 details of the
breathe-1 and early studies are given in table 3.

 xxxd138xxx 
 xxxd138xxx  is a selective etar antagonist with a longer half-life
than  xxxd358xxx  (9 h vs 5.4 h, respectively), administered orally. it
is approved for the treatment of patients with pah in who
fc ii and iii in the usa, europe and several other regions.
theoretically, selective etar antagonists should be more effective than dual eras in that they only target the vasoconstrictive
and mitogenic activities of et-1–etar, while preserving the
vasodilatory and antimitogenic effect of et-1– xxxg677xxx .59 despite
its selectivity for etar,  xxxd138xxx  has not shown greater efﬁcacy in non-comparative monotherapy clinical trials, compared
with  xxxd358xxx .60 this may be because the distribution or function of  xxxg677xxx  is altered in disease states, and thus dual receptor
blockers appear to perform as well as those eras with a speciﬁc
target.61 unlike  xxxd358xxx ,  xxxd138xxx  was not associated with
elevated liver toxicity,62 32 but peripheral oedema was reported
more frequently compared with placebo.27 details of the
aries-1 and aries-2 trials are given in table 3, and the
aries-e extension study is detailed in table 4.

 xxxd2529xxx 
 xxxd2529xxx  is a dual receptor era, administered orally. it is
approved for the treatment of pah for the long-term treatment
of who fc ii and iii patients with pah in the usa and europe.
 xxxd2529xxx  was not associated with liver toxicity.28 decreased
haemoglobin levels have been reported more frequently in
patients receiving  xxxd2529xxx  versus placebo in randomised controlled trials. details of the seraphin study are given in table 3.

review
inhibition of phosphodiesterase-5
the pde superfamily of enzymes inactivates and degrades cyclic
 xxxd1067xxx  (cgmp) and camp, important vasoactive mediators that, via activation of cgmp-dependent protein
kinase (pkg) and pka, trigger vasodilation and inhibit proliferation (pkg can also be activated by increasing levels of camp).
pde5 is abundantly expressed in the vsmcs of the pulmonary
vasculature and is upregulated in pah in the vsmcs, and in
right ventricle (rv) cardiomyocytes.63–66 the upregulation of
pde5 results in increased hydrolysis of cgmp. the pde5 inhibitors sildenaﬁl and tadalaﬁl occupy the catalytic site on pde5,
blocking the degradation of cgmp.67 pde5 inhibitors prevent
cgmp degradation but are dependent on cgmp synthesis and
the presence of no.68 69 however, there is also evidence to
suggest that the beneﬁcial effects of pde5 inhibition in ph are
inﬂuenced by natriuretic peptide activity and the presence of
natriuretic peptide-derived cgmp.70

sildenaﬁl
sildenaﬁl is an oral pde5 inhibitor approved for the treatment
of patients with pah in who fc ii–iii in europe and
who fc ii–iv in the usa. the details of super-1 and
super-2, the long-term extension are given in tables 3 and 4.

tadalaﬁl
tadalaﬁl is an oral pde5 inhibitor with a longer half-life than
sildenaﬁl, allowing once-daily dosing, rather than the three
times daily dose that is indicated with sildenaﬁl. it is approved
in the usa, europe and several other countries for the treatment of patients with pah in who fc ii–iii. details of the
phirst-1 study and its long-term extension phirst-2 are
given in tables 3 and 4.

stimulation of sgc
sgc is expressed in the vsmcs of the pulmonary vasculature,
platelets, rv and other tissues. when bound to no, sgc catalyses the conversion of gtp to cgmp,71 72 promoting vasodilation and inhibiting smooth muscle proliferation, leucocyte
recruitment, inﬂammation, ﬁbrosis, platelet aggregation and vascular remodelling via several downstream mechanisms.73 the
sgc stimulator  xxxd3127xxx  is the ﬁrst member of this novel class
of therapeutics.69 73–75

 xxxd3127xxx 
 xxxd3127xxx  is an oral sgc stimulator with a dual mode of action.
it sensitises sgc to endogenous no by stabilising no–sgc
binding.  xxxd3127xxx  also directly stimulates sgc, independently
of no,73 69 resulting in increased generation of cgmp.73 69–76
currently,  xxxd3127xxx  is the only pharmacotherapy to be approved
for the treatment of two ph indications, pah and chronic
thromboembolic ph (cteph).14–16  xxxd3127xxx  is approved in
the usa, europe and several other regions for patients with
group i pah in who fc ii or iii; and for the treatment of
patients with inoperable cteph, or persistent/recurrent ph
after pulmonary endarterectomy in who fc ii or iii. patients
receiving  xxxd3127xxx  have their dose individually adjusted up to
the optimal dose over a period of 8 weeks, according to the
patient’s systolic systemic arterial blood pressure and signs or
symptoms of hypotension.
 xxxd3127xxx  and pde5 inhibitors act on separate targets within
the no signalling pathway. combining them may increase the
risk of amplifying their effects, leading to systemic hypotension.
therefore, the use of pde5 inhibitors in conjunction with
humbert m, ghofrani h-a. thorax 2015;0:1–11. doi:10.1136/thoraxjnl-2015-207170

 xxxd3127xxx  is contraindicated.14–16 77 rare cases of haemoptysis
have been reported with  xxxd3127xxx  therapy in patients with pah
and cteph. details of the patent-1 study and its long-term
extension patent-2 are given in tables 3 and 4.

combination therapy
combining two or more classes of agent is a strategy that has
been used successfully in the treatment of many other cardiovascular conditions such as systemic hypertension and heart
failure.17 combination therapy can be given as ﬁrst-line treatment or by sequentially adding drugs to a patient’s treatment
regimen. the 2013 updated algorithm of pah treatment from
the 5th world symposium on ph recommends sequential combination therapy, due to the high level of evidence of efﬁcacy, in
patients with pah with an inadequate response to monotherapy,
and possible ﬁrst-line combination therapy in who fc iii and
iv patients with a lower recommendation.17 several clinical
trials have now assessed the effect of combination therapy in
patients with pah, with mixed results (see below). several
recent meta-analyses of the efﬁcacy of combination therapy
versus monotherapy, however, conclude that combination
therapy can improve clinical outcomes, but has no proven effect
on mortality.78–81 however, all acknowledge that more data are
required from further studies.

first-line combination therapy
there are few data available on the use of combination therapy
as a ﬁrst-line treatment. the breathe-282 study investigated
the effect of combined treatment with  xxxd358xxx  and epoprostenol versus epoprostenol and placebo in a small group of 33
patients with severe pah (who fc iii and iv) over 16 weeks,
but did not demonstrate a signiﬁcant difference between the
two treatments in the primary endpoint of total pulmonary
resistance. three deaths were reported, all in the  xxxd358xxx  arm;
however, investigators concluded that they reﬂected the severity
and progressive nature of pah and were not related to study
treatment.
first-line combination therapy with  xxxd138xxx  and tadalaﬁl
was evaluated in the randomised, multicentre ambition
study.83 84 this study had a dual placebo design, with one
placebo group receiving  xxxd138xxx  monotherapy with placebo
tadalaﬁl, while the second placebo group received tadalaﬁl
monotherapy with placebo  xxxd138xxx . with 610 patients
enrolled, and followed up for up to 3.5 years,84 ambition
was a considerably larger trial than the pioneer breathe-2
study. signiﬁcant improvements were seen in the composite
primary endpoint of morbidity/mortality in the combination
group compared with the pooled monotherapy arms, which
were driven by differences in hospitalisation. hierarchical
testing of secondary endpoints showed signiﬁcant improvements
in n-terminal prohormone of brain natriuretic peptide
(nt-probnp), proportion of patients with satisfactory clinical
response, and 6mwd. no important safety signals were
observed. at the time of writing, the results of the ambition
trial have only been presented in abstract form and have not yet
been published.83

sequential combination therapy
several studies have evaluated the efﬁcacy of adding a new
therapy to a patient’s existing pah treatment regimen, with
variable results (ﬁgure 2).
the addition of sildenaﬁl or  xxxd3127xxx  to prostanoid treatment
has proved successful. the paces study investigated the addition of sildenaﬁl 80 mg three times daily (four times the

approved dose) to the treatment of 267 patients with pah
already receiving epoprostenol.85 after 16 weeks of treatment,
improvements were seen in 6mwd, mean pulmonary arterial
pressure, cardiac output, time to clinical worsening (ttcw)
and quality of life (qol) compared with placebo. adverse
events (aes) observed more often with sildenaﬁl treatment were
headache and dyspepsia.85 patent-131 investigated the efﬁcacy
and safety of  xxxd3127xxx  as combination therapy and monotherapy. of 443 patients, 222 were receiving eras (n=194) or nonintravenous prostanoids (n=28). overall, after 12 weeks of
treatment, 6mwd, pvr, nt-probnp, who fc, ttcw, qol
and borg dyspnoea score were signiﬁcantly improved.  xxxd3127xxx 
was effective in combination therapy and as monotherapy. the
most common aes that occurred during the study were headache, dyspepsia and peripheral oedema.31
 xxxd2529xxx  has been shown to be effective in patients already
receiving either non-intravenous prostanoids or pde5 inhibitors. the seraphin study28 investigated whether long-term
treatment with  xxxd2529xxx  reduced a combined endpoint of
morbidity or mortality in patients with pah as either combination or monotherapy over 3 years.86 of 742 patients treated,
471 were receiving either pde5 inhibitors (n=454) or nonintravenous prostanoids (n=40). overall, there was a signiﬁcant
reduction in the risk of a combined endpoint event in patients
8

receiving  xxxd2529xxx  compared with placebo, which was driven
by deterioration in pah. the risk of a combined endpoint event
for patients receiving  xxxd2529xxx  as monotherapy was lower
than for patients receiving  xxxd2529xxx  in combination therapy.
however, patients receiving combination therapy showed a signiﬁcant improvement in 6mwd, whereas patients receiving
 xxxd2529xxx  monotherapy did not. nasopharyngitis, headache
and anaemia were more common in patients receiving  xxxd2529xxx  than in those receiving placebo.28
the efﬁcacy of adding  xxxd358xxx  to other therapies has not
been proven, despite its evaluation in several studies. in the
phase iv, event-driven compass-287 study, 334 patients receiving sildenaﬁl for at least 12 weeks were randomised to either
placebo or  xxxd358xxx . the primary endpoint of time to the ﬁrst
morbidity/mortality event (deﬁned as death, hospitalisation for
pah worsening or intravenous prostanoid initiation, atrial septostomy, lung transplant, or worsening pah) was not met, with
a non-signiﬁcant observed risk reduction for morbidity/mortality. improvements were observed in secondary endpoints
6mwd and nt-probnp. the safety proﬁle was consistent with
that of  xxxd358xxx , with no new signals observed.87
in a study design that was essentially a reversal of

review
receiving  xxxd358xxx . the trial did not meet its primary endpoint
of a signiﬁcant increase in 6mwd in patients treated with combined  xxxd358xxx  and sildenaﬁl compared with patients treated
with  xxxd358xxx  alone. the most common aes in the sildenaﬁl
group were diarrhoea, headache and peripheral oedema.88
the addition of  xxxd3127xxx  on top of  xxxd358xxx  therapy has
been efﬁcacious in patent-1.31 however, the step89 study
investigating the addition of inhaled  xxxd2331xxx  to  xxxd358xxx  treatment in patients with pah (n=67) showed a numerically
greater 6mwd in the inhaled  xxxd2331xxx  plus  xxxd358xxx  group
compared with  xxxd358xxx  alone at 12 weeks. while this trend
did not reach statistical signiﬁcance, there were signiﬁcant
improvements in who fc, ttcw, mean pulmonary artery
pressure and pvr. the most frequently reported aes in the  xxxd2331xxx  group were consistent with the safety proﬁle of prostanoids, and included headache, ﬂushing and jaw pain.89
the phirst study30 investigated tadalaﬁl as monotherapy or
in combination therapy, with  xxxd358xxx  in 405 patients. after
16 weeks, improvement in 6mwd in patients receiving tadalaﬁl
as monotherapy was signiﬁcant, whereas that of patients receiving combination therapy was not. the most common
treatment-related aes reported with tadalaﬁl were headache,
myalgia and ﬂushing.30
compass-390 was a study investigating the beneﬁts of a
stepped approach to combination therapy. one hundred
treatment-naïve patients started receiving  xxxd358xxx  for
16 weeks. if they failed to achieve a 6mwd ≥380 m by
week 16, they were given sildenaﬁl in addition to  xxxd358xxx . at
the end of the trial, 31% of patients had achieved the ≥380 m
threshold (16% on monotherapy and 15% on combination
therapy). no statistical analysis is available. the most common
reported aes were peripheral oedema, dyspnoea, headache, dizziness, anaemia and abnormal liver function tests.90
there is some evidence that the delivery route of a drug may
inﬂuence its efﬁcacy in combination with other drugs. the
triumph study21 investigated the effect of adding inhaled
 xxxd3415xxx  to the therapy regimen of 235 patients with pah
who were receiving  xxxd358xxx  or sildenaﬁl. after 12 weeks,
there were signiﬁcant improvements in 6mwd, qol and
nt-probnp, but not in ttcw or who fc. aes associated
with  xxxd3415xxx  treatment were cough, headache and ﬂushing.21 conversely, the addition of oral  xxxd3415xxx  to similar
background therapy as triumph was not successful. the
freedom-c study91 investigated the effect of adding oral
 xxxd3415xxx  to the regimen of 350 patients receiving eras and/
or pde5 inhibitors. after 16 weeks, the primary endpoint,
improvement in 6mwd, did not reach signiﬁcance. aes that
resulted in study drug discontinuation included headache,
nausea, diarrhoea, vomiting, worsening ph, extremity pain,
chest discomfort and myalgia.91
the background therapy of a patient may also inﬂuence the
choice of add-on treatment. for patients who are already receiving pde5 inhibitors,  xxxd3127xxx  is contraindicated. the phase ii
patent-plus77 study investigated the safety and clinical effect
of  xxxd3127xxx  in combination with sildenaﬁl in 18 patients. after
12 weeks, combination therapy showed no favourable effects on
exploratory clinical parameters, including haemodynamics and
6mwd. the primary endpoint of the trial, change from baseline in supine systolic blood pressure versus placebo, did not
show a difference between  xxxd3127xxx  and placebo. there were
unfavourable safety signals (high rates of discontinuation due to
hypotension and saes) with sildenaﬁl plus  xxxd3127xxx  in the longterm, single-arm, open-label phase of the study and no evidence
of a positive beneﬁt:risk ratio.77

conclusions
the pathobiology of pah is complex, and it is necessary for
prescribing clinicians to have a thorough understanding of the
mode of action of the drugs available for pah and of the evidence base of various combinations. the approval of  xxxd3127xxx 
has introduced a new, fourth class of pharmacotherapy, targeting
the no–sgc–cgmp pathway with a different molecular target
to previously approved pde5 inhibitors. however, comparative
studies of the approved classes of therapy are lacking. although
more evidence from trials of various therapies in combination is
becoming available, the beneﬁts of many therapy combinations
remain inconclusive. the question of sequential versus ﬁrst-line
combination therapy is still under investigation, with further
studies warranted. combination therapy according to patient
phenotype will also need to be guided by future studies. despite
the advances made in recent years, pah remains an incurable
disease and as such, there is still an unmet medical need for new
therapies, possibly targeting alternative pathways.
