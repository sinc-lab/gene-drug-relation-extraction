abstract
 xxxg730xxx  alpha ( xxxg730xxx ) is present in the heart consistent with estrogen-induced modulation of cardiac function by genomic and nongenomic mechanisms, and with estrogen-mediated cardioprotective effects. we show that, in heart from adult male rats,  xxxg730xxx  is detected mainly as
two distinct isoforms: (i) a ∼66 kda isoform with the expected mass of the classical full-length  xxxg730xxx  and (ii) an additional isoform of ∼45 kda.
differential centrifugation separated the 66 kda isoform into the cytosolic fraction; while the 45 kda isoform was enriched in the membrane
fraction. high-resolution confocal studies show that  xxxg730xxx  is distributed in the nucleus, cytosol, and various membranes including the
plasmalemma. notoriously,  xxxg730xxx  labeling was very prominent in t-tubular membranes defined by alpha-actinin staining and the intercalated disks. in
the t-tubules,  xxxg730xxx  degree of association to alpha-actinin depends on the distribution pattern of the receptor along the t-tubules; association is high
when  xxxg730xxx  pattern is “continuous,” while it is low when the receptor has a discontinuous “granular” distribution. nuclear  xxxg730xxx  has a distinct
trabecular distribution and it is excluded from the heterochromatin, consistent with an active transcription factor. treatment with estrogen (∼4 h)
produced an overall decrease in both nuclear and non-nuclear  xxxg730xxx  levels and made more evident discrete  xxxg730xxx  nuclear puncta uncovering cellular
mechanism(s) of short term action of estrogen in the heart. the results indicate that the levels of the cardiac  xxxg730xxx  isoforms are downregulated by
estrogen and are differentially distributed: the full-length  xxxg730xxx  is mainly compartmentalized in the cytosol and nucleus, while the 45 kda isoform
is mainly present in membrane structures. the membrane localization of  xxxg730xxx  may support the rapid effects of estrogens on heart function.

1. introduction
estrogens act through the estrogen receptors alpha ( xxxg730xxx ) and
beta ( xxxg731xxx ) which are members of the nuclear receptor family. the
full-length classical  xxxg730xxx , formed by 595–600 amino acids
(∼66 kda), regulates the transcription of downstream target genes
upon estrogen (e2) stimulation, and produces the typical genomic

long-term effects of the transcription factors [1–3]. immunolabeling of cultured cardiomyocytes showed the presence of  xxxg730xxx 
(66 kda) and  xxxg731xxx  (54 kda) with  xxxg730xxx  mainly in the cytoplasm
[4]. consistent with a functional role of estrogen receptors in the
heart, e2 can modulate cardiac function by both genomic and
rapid non-genomic mechanisms [5]. in fact, recent work showed
that e2 treatment reduces myocardial injury associated with
ischemia–reperfusion [6];  xxxg730xxx  but not  xxxg731xxx  is required for the e2
induced cardioprotective effect [7]. furthermore, e2 can exert
rapid effects on the heart by reducing the activity of l-type ca2+
channels; and raloxifene, a selective modulator of estrogen
receptors, can acutely reduce cardiomyocyte contractility through

the inhibition of l-type ca2+ channels [8,9]. in spite of the functional role of  xxxg730xxx  in the heart, its biochemical characterization,
potential targeting to the plasma or tubular membranes, or its
regulation by e2 has not yet been established in adult heart.
in this work, we show that, in heart from adult male rats,  xxxg730xxx 
is present in two main forms, the expected full-length of
∼66 kda protein and a new form of ∼45 kda not previously
detected in heart. a salient finding is the high abundance of  xxxg730xxx 
in t-tubular membranes with a variable degree of association
with alpha-actinin depending upon the  xxxg730xxx  pattern uncovering two
classes of cardiomyocytes. the abundance of  xxxg730xxx  in t-tubular
membrane correlates with the 45 kda form enrichment in the
crude membrane fraction. furthermore, e2 treatment reduced
the overall abundance of  xxxg730xxx  and modified the nuclear  xxxg730xxx 
labeling revealing a strong punctate distribution.

at 3500 rpm for 10 min followed by centrifugation of the supernatant at 100,000 × g; the resulting pellet contained the crude
membranes and the supernatant is referred to as the cytosolic
fraction (cf). proteins (20 mug) were separated using 10% sdspage and immunoblotted with anti- xxxg730xxx  antibodies (mc20 2 mug/
ml; sra1010 1 mug/ml; and ab16460 1 mug/ml). immunoblots
were scanned using the odyssey infrared imaging system (li-cor)
and analyzed using metamorph (universal imaging corp.).
2.4. myocyte isolation and effect of e2

2. materials and methods

adult cardiomyocytes were isolated as previously described
[10] and allowed to attach to laminin (10 mug/ml)-precoated
coverslips for ∼30 min at room temperature prior fixation. to
test the effect of e2, cardiomyocytes were isolated in the
continuous presence of either 10 nm or 1 mum e2 or vehicle
(dmso).

2.1. animals

2.5. cell staining and microscopy

adult male sprague–dawley rats (3 to 4 months old) were
sacrificed under isoflurane anesthesia. protocols received institutional review committee approval.

whole heart sections and isolated cells were used. whole hearts
were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (pfa), 2% picric acid in 0.1 m
na2hpo4 and 23 mm nahpo4 (ph 7.4) for 2 h on ice, and
transversal 20 mum sections were obtained with a cryostat. prior to
immunostaining, sections were treated with cold acetone (15 min
at −20 °c). freshly isolated cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 m na2hpo4 and 23 mm nahpo4 (ph 7.4) at room
temperature for 20 min, and permeabilized with 0.2% triton-x
100; or fixed with cold acetone (15 min at −20 °c). non-specific
binding was blocked for 30 min at room temperature using 10%
goat or donkey serum in pbs ph 7.4 containing 0.2% triton x100 to permeabilize the cells. samples were incubated with antieralpha antibodies (mc20 2 mug/ml; sra1010 6.6 mug/ml; and/or
ab16460 6.6 mug/ml) dissolved in pbs plus 1% goat or donkey
serum for 24–48 h at 4 °c under gentle shaking. the specificity of
mc20 and sra1010 antibodies was tested by preadsorbing the
antibodies with the corresponding antigenic peptides (10 mug
antigen/mug antibody) overnight at 4 °c prior to immunostaining.
the anti-alpha-actinin antibody (sigma) was used at 1:800 dilution.
samples were washed and incubated with secondary antibodies
alexa 488 anti-rabbit igg and alexa 594 anti-mouse igg1 (2 mug/
ml, molecular probes) or with alexa 488 anti-mouse igg (2 mug/
ml, molecular probes) and rhodamine redtm-x-conjugated
affinity-purified donkey anti-rabbit igg (3 mug/ml jackson immunoresearch laboratories, inc.) in pbs plus 1% goat serum and
0.2% triton x-100 for 1 h at room temperature. for dna staining,
cells were incubated with dapi (500 nm) in pbs for 15 min. as
additional control, samples were incubated with secondary antibodies alone which yielded no signals.

2.2. reagents
anti- xxxg730xxx  antibodies: rabbit polyclonal mc20 directed toward
the c-terminal domain of  xxxg730xxx  (lot  xxxg1504xxx , epitope 575–595)
and corresponding antigenic peptide were from santa cruz;
mouse monoclonal sra1010 (cat. sra1010, lot b112427,
epitope 582–595) and corresponding antigenic peptide were from
stressgen; mouse monoclonal ab16460 (clone te111.5d11,
cat. ab16460, epitope 302–595) was from abcam. anti-alphaactinin antibody was from sigma. 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole
(dapi) and secondary antibodies were from molecular probes or
li-cor.
2.3. tissue preparation for western blots
hearts from anesthetized rats were removed, washed in
phosphate-buffered saline (pbs in mm: 2.68 kcl, 1.47
kh2po4, 137 nacl, 8.1 na2hpo4), frozen in liquid nitrogen,
and immediately processed. all procedures were performed at 1–
4°c. single frozen hearts were powdered on dry ice and homogenized (polytron, brinkmann instruments) in 2–3 ml lysis buffer
(carbonate buffer: 0.5 m na2co3, ph 11.5 or triton buffer:
25 mm mes in 1% triton x-100) supplemented or not with
protease inhibitors (cocktail 1 or cocktail 2). cocktail 1: 4 mug/ml
pepstatin (roche), 0.1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride
(roche), 0.1 mm  xxxd302xxx  (sigma) plus 40 mul/ml of a mixture
of protease inhibitors dissolved in 2 ml (complete, roche).
cocktail 2: 1 mm p-hydroxy- xxxd2843xxx , sodium salt
(sigma), 2.5 mm iodoacetamide (sigma), 1 mg/ml leupeptin
(roche), and 1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride (roche).
heart lysates (hl) were prepared by filtering with cheesecloth the
whole heart homogenate without centrifugation. crude membranes (cm) were obtained after an initial centrifugation of the hl

2.6. improved resolution by image restoration
the major advantage of confocal over wide-field microscopy
consists in reducing the amount of out of focus signal obtained
by means of a pinhole positioned in the light path. in spite of this
improvement, intrinsic optical non-uniformities still produce
some out of focus fluorescence in confocal images. this can be

498

a.b. ropero et al. / journal of molecular and cellular cardiology 41 (2006) 496–510

significantly improved by image processing with deconvolution
algorithms using 3d image stacks to restore the signal lost by
diffraction to its original point source (autoquant) [11]. we
processed the images with a 3d-blind deconvolution algorithm
that involves the characterization of the point-spread function
(psf) in the sample. this algorithm applies the “maximum
likelihood” to search for the psf in the specimen causing the
acquired image [12]. the deconvolution process removes the out
of focus information transforming diffuse psf in a single point
psf [13].
in previous work, we showed the improvement of resolution
by image restoration on the psf at a lower resolution (0.057 mum/
pixel in the x, y plane) [14]. here we illustrate with more detail a
similar effect at higher resolution (0.0115 mum/pixel in the x, y
plane). fig. 1a shows the projection in different planes of the
stack of images of a 0.1 mum fluorescein fluorescent bead (fitc).
the images were acquired with a laser scanning confocal
microscope (60x, 1.4 na, oil immersion) at a sampling distance
of 100 nm in the z axis and with a pixel size of 11.5 nm in the x, y
plane. the psf in a confocal microscope is oval being longer
when visualized in the z axis (fig. 1a). fig. 1b shows the same
image after restoration by 3d-blind deconvolution. note the
reduction in the psf size in all planes. as the psf is the unitary
element producing the images, the reduction of the psf size
increases the image resolution [14]. with this methodology, we
have been able to resolve in the x, y plane two beads separated
by 170 nm (data not shown).
the increase in spatial resolution and signal to noise ratio
by image restoration in isolated heart cells immunostained
with anti- xxxg730xxx  antibody is illustrated in fig. 1, which displays
unprocessed (c) and deconvolved (d) images from a single
confocal section. the pixel size was 38 nm in the x, y plane
and the sampling distance in the axial (z) direction was
0.1 mum. for comparative purposes, the images are displayed
with the same intensity settings. note the increase in
sharpness, contrast, and intensity after image restoration as
the light diffracted by the optical system was recovered after
deconvolution. membrane and nuclear patterns that were
barely discernible in the unprocessed image became clearly
delineated after image restoration. to illustrate the improvement in the signal to noise ratio, the pixel intensity vs.
distance was plotted in fig. 1e along line 1 in panels 1c (fig.
1e, dotted line) and 1d (fig. 1e, continuous line). note the
reduction in noise and the increase in the peak signal after
deconvolution due to the restoration of the diffracted
fluorescence intensity to the source points. here, we used
this improved methodology to characterize the different
subcellular compartments of  xxxg730xxx  in isolated heart myocytes.

3. results
3.1. adult heart possesses two  xxxg730xxx  isoforms with different
molecular masses and distribution in cytosolic and crude
membrane fractions
we initially characterized the existence of immunolabeled
proteins in heart lysates (hl) from adult male rats with two antieralpha antibodies raised against overlapping but distinct epitopes
(mc20 and sra1010). fig. 2a illustrates that two strong bands of
approximately 66 kda and 45 kda were recognized by both
antibodies. these bands are specific since they were effectively
competed by the antigenic peptide. the 66 kda band has the
expected size of the full-length  xxxg730xxx  as reported in cardiomyocytes
[4]; however, the 45 kda band is firstly accounted here as present in
adult heart. the fact that two different anti- xxxg730xxx  antibodies
recognize the same bands and that the antibody labeling was
blocked when the antibodies were preincubated with the
corresponding antigenic peptides support the view that these
antibodies recognize the  xxxg730xxx  protein in the heart. a lighter band at
∼55 kda was sometimes detected with both antibodies that could
also be blocked. to evaluate whether the 45 kda protein is a
degradation product of the full-length  xxxg730xxx  produced during the
biochemical procedure, we used heart lysates with different
cocktails of protease inhibitors. three conditions were tested: (1)
absence of protease inhibitors; (2) cocktail 1 (standard protease
inhibitors), and (3) cocktail 2, with protease inhibitors known to
decrease  xxxg730xxx  proteolysis [15]. the 45 kda band was not altered by
the different protease cocktails used and was similarly abundant in
all three conditions (fig. 2b) (equal loading was controlled by
ponceau-s staining of the membranes, not shown). further, the ratio
between the intensities of the 45 kda and the 66 kda bands showed
no significant difference among the three conditions (fig. 2c).
to gain insight into the subcellular localization of both  xxxg730xxx 
isoforms, we determined the relative abundance of the 66 kda and
45 kda bands in crude membrane and cytosolic fractions. fig. 2d
shows that the 66 kda band was only present in the cytosolic
fraction, while the 45 kda band was strikingly enriched in the
crude membrane fraction (5.7 ± 0.5 fold enrichment, n = 3).
the results indicate that heart  xxxg730xxx  is present in at least two
forms of 66 kda and 45 kda, where the latter is not the result of the
extraction protocol but a native form of the receptor. furthermore,
the differential sedimentation properties suggest that both forms of
the receptor may be located in different subcellular compartments
in the heart. we hypothesized that  xxxg730xxx  – besides localizing to the
nucleus and cytoplasm – would be present in membranous
structures of cardiomyocytes, and thus, investigated its
subcellular localization using high resolution confocal
microscopy.

2.7. statistics
data were expressed as means ± se with n the number of
independent observations. comparisons between two groups
were analyzed by student's t test. a probability level less
than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. experimental observations were repeated at least in three different
animals.

3.2.  xxxg730xxx  immunostaining of nuclear and membrane regions in
heart sections and isolated cells
whole heart sections and freshly isolated cardiomyocytes were
immunostained with various anti- xxxg730xxx  antibodies including those
used in immunoblots. supporting our hypothesis, fig. 3a shows
that, in heart sections, anti- xxxg730xxx  mc20 antibody staining delineates

a.b. ropero et al. / journal of molecular and cellular cardiology 41 (2006) 496–510

in a striking manner transversal “membranous” structures, intercalated disks (id), and as expected for a transcription factor, the
nuclei (n). to achieve higher optical resolution and details of the
subcellular distribution of  xxxg730xxx , we stained isolated cardiomyocytes as in this case images are better processed due to lower
optical non-uniformities. isolated cardiomyocytes showed a
similar pattern of  xxxg730xxx  staining (fig. 3b) as the whole heart
sections indicating that the isolation procedure did not disturb the
native subcellular localization of  xxxg730xxx . single cells displayed

499

labeling of  xxxg730xxx  in the nuclei, at the surface plasma membrane, in
transverse structures and at the intercalate disks. the  xxxg730xxx  labeling
of the transverse structures could differentiate two types of cells
with distinct patterns: a “continuous” (cells marked *) and a
“granular” labeling (cells marked **) with the latter being in
general less intense. to confirm the validity of  xxxg730xxx  labeling, we
compared the labeling pattern with three different anti- xxxg730xxx 
antibodies. figs. 3c–e illustrate a similar labeling pattern in
transverse structures and intercalate disks with sra1010 (c),

ab16460 (d), and mc20 (e). the labeling of all these subcellular
structures by the anti- xxxg730xxx  mc20 and sra1010 antibodies was
specific as the labeling was blocked when the antibody was
preadsorbed with the antigenic peptide. an example of blocking is
illustrated for mc20 in figs. 3f and g. the fusion protein used to
raise the ab16460 antibody was unavailable; nevertheless
incubation with only the secondary yielded no signal and its
signals tightly colocalized with mc20 labeling (see below).
3.3. quantification of the degree of colabeling of  xxxg730xxx  by two
different antibodies
to quantify the degree of protein colabeling by two different
antibodies, we followed several steps: (i) maximized the loca-

lization precision of our images by acquiring confocal images at
0.028–0.058 nm/pixel in the x, y plane and every 0.1 mum in the z
axis; (ii) deblurred confocal images by 3d blind deconvolution
which can give a spatial resolution reaching the diffraction limit
[13,16] of ∼0.2 mum (x, y plane) and ∼0.4 mum (z plane) [14]
(spatial resolution can be higher than localization precision as it
depends on the sampling frequency and the sharpness of the pixel
intensity gradient [17]); and (iii) used a novel “colocalization”
analysis by subdividing the image in discrete 1 mum2 regions and
performing correlation analysis in each one of them to avoid
vectorial nullification of correlation as a result of analysis of the
whole image as described below.
we designed a modification to the method of correlation
analysis of the planes [18]. in this analysis, the prediction is that

fig. 2.  xxxg730xxx  receptor is present as two isoforms proteins (∼66 and ∼45 kda) with different sedimentation properties. (a) immunoblots of heart lysate (hl) with the
anti- xxxg730xxx  antibodies (lysates were in carbonate buffer for mc20 and in triton buffer for sra1010). both antibodies show strong labeling of two similar bands of
approximately 66 and 45 kda that are absent when the antibodies were preincubated with the antigenic peptide. a similar pattern was observed using ab16460
antibody. all three abs labeled a ∼66 kda band in lysates from hek293t cells expressing rat  xxxg730xxx  (not shown). (b) immunoblots of heart lysates (hl) obtained
under three different conditions of protease inhibitors: absence of protease inhibitors, cocktail 1 or cocktail 2 of inhibitors. (c) ratio between the pixel intensities of
the 45 kda and 66 kda bands (n = 3). the differences are not statistically significant. (d) immunoblot of the cytosolic (cf) and crude membrane (cm) fractions

(cm). mm = molecular weight markers. each lane was loaded with 20 mug of total protein. panels b, c, and d are with mc20 antibody.

when two proteins associate, the intensity staining landscape of
the two images should have a positive correlation coefficient
(cc); if the two proteins are localized in distinct compartments,
the result will be a negative cc; and when the proteins are labeled
in a diffuse non-structured pattern (random), cc will tend to zero.
cc values range between −1 and 1, and their statistical significance can be evaluated by the non-parametric psign test [19].
however, real images show in most cases areas of positive and
negative “colocalization” that, when globally analyzed, will tend
to subtract each other. thus, the information of individual regions
with positive or negative “colocalization” is ignored missing
information of discrete areas. to overcome this caveat, we developed a strategy (discrete correlation analysis) to differentiate, in
the same plane, regions with positive and negative correlation; the
objective was to differentiate and quantify in the whole image the
number of regions displaying protein “colocalization” or “noncolocalization.”
to take into account the “colocalization” levels in the various
regions of the image, we divided the image with a grid of equal
squares (1 mum2) and calculated the cc and psign test for each square

501

in the grid. to quantify the degree of protein association, we divided
the number of squares with positive cc values and p < 0.05 by the
total number of squares. we refer to this quantity as protein
proximity index (ppi). we validated this method in cardiomyocytes
by measuring ppi labeling  xxxg730xxx  with two different antibodies.
3.3.1. high ppi of  xxxg730xxx  labeling with two anti- xxxg730xxx  antibodies
fig. 4 illustrates  xxxg730xxx  immunolabeled with anti- xxxg730xxx  antibodies raised against different epitopes (a, ab16460 green; b,
mc20, red) and the overlayed images (c); a–c are the regions
outlined in the upper panels at higher magnification. both
antibody labelings show a high degree of overlap (c, c). fig. 4d
shows the plot of the psign value vs. cc of 1 mum2 regions of images
in figs. 4a and b. the shadowed area depicts the regions with
positive cc and with p < 0.05. the large majority of the discrete
regions show positive cc values resulting in ppi = 0.98. this can
be seen in the cc distribution histogram showing the number of
regions with positive cc values >0 (fig. 5e, red columns). the
validity of the high degree of association was confirmed by
measuring ppi values as a function of pixel shift in the x axis

which was reduced from 0.98 to 0.18 after 0.40 mum pixel shift of
one plane (fig. 4f) (compare figs. 4f and 6i for equivalent results
for  xxxg730xxx  and alpha-actinin association). the dependence of the ppi
values on the one plane shift confirmed a high degree of colocalization of both antibody labelings indicating that the anti- xxxg730xxx 
antibodies mc20 and ab16460 are labeling the same protein, i.e.
 xxxg730xxx . this analysis further validates the use of mc20 to label
 xxxg730xxx  in the following studies.
3.4. quantification of “continuous” and “granular” membrane
labeling
fig. 5a shows at a higher magnification  xxxg730xxx  labeling at the
surface plasma membrane in two cells of the same preparation

displaying distinct labeling patters: “continuous” (*) and
“granular” (**). the two patterns were observed in practically
all preparations (>20) of isolated cardiomyocytes and were
independent of the fixation procedure. in both types of cells, the
labeling of the intercalated disks was seemingly more evident
(fig. 5b, c, arrows). in addition to the strong staining in nuclear
and membranous structures,  xxxg730xxx  also localized in the cytosol
forming diffuse aggregates difficult to visualize due the strong
labeling in the other compartments.
to define in a quantitative manner the “continuous” and
“granular” patterns found in isolated myocytes, we characterized in
non-nuclear regions the dependence of pixel intensity area above
threshold as a function of the threshold by plotting the % area above
threshold (%a) vs. the threshold (t) defined as the fraction of

maximum intensity. fig. 5d illustrates the results for two groups of
six cells each showing “continuous” (*) or “granular” (**) patterns.
the solid lines are the fit to the sum of two decaying exponential
functions: %a1 *exp(−t /epsilon1) + %a2 * exp(−t /epsilon2), where %a1 and
%a2, and epsilon1 and epsilon2 are the amplitudes and decay threshold
constants for the 1st and 2nd components, respectively. the first
steep component mainly corresponds to pixel intensity values close
to background while the shallow second component arises from the
stronger  xxxg730xxx  labeling. the dashed line is the fit of the shallow
second exponential demonstrating that its decay threshold constant,
epsilon2, and its corresponding area  xxxg831xxx  = %a2 *epsilon2 are larger for cells with
a “continuous” pattern than for cells with a granular structure

503

( xxxg831xxx ,continuous = 4.72, epsilon2,continuous = 0.12 vs.  xxxg831xxx ,granular = 1.5,
epsilon2,granular = 0.06). this is to be expected for a labeling in the
“continuous” pattern as a smoother pixel intensity distribution
would result in a relatively more shallow relationship between
the thresholded area (above threshold) and the threshold. on
the other hand, a granular and spiky intensity distribution
would generate a steeper dependence between the thresholded
area (above threshold) and the threshold, as it is the case for
the “granular” pattern. to estimate the overall distribution of
cells with “continuous” and “granular” patterns, we constructed
the histogram of the shallow 2nd exponential area,  xxxg831xxx , of 104
cells from 4 different preparations (fig. 5e). the histogram

demonstrates the existence of two distinct cell populations with
mean  xxxg831xxx  values of 1.11 and 5.7 corresponding to the “granular”
(**) and “continuous” (*) distribution patterns, respectively.
3.5.  xxxg730xxx  distributes along the transverse tubules marked by
alpha-actinin
 xxxg730xxx  immunostaining in cells with continuous labeling as
described above seemed to be highly concentrated in transversal
structures along the cells as labeling the z line (figs. 3–5). to
test whether these transversal structures correspond to the z
line, we performed double labeling for  xxxg730xxx  and alpha-actinin
which is an actin-binding protein associated with the z-lines

where t-tubules are located [20,21]. indeed, figs. 6a–c show a
sharp labeling of  xxxg730xxx  (green) and alpha-actinin (red) with a striking
transversal distribution of both proteins with high overlap (the
boxed areas are displayed in larger detail in figs. 6d–f). the
strong colabeling of  xxxg730xxx  and alpha-actinin indicates that  xxxg730xxx  is
distributed accompanying the t-tubular membranes along the
z-line. these immunolabeling results together with the high
levels of  xxxg730xxx  (45 kda) in the crude membrane fraction (fig.
2d) support the hypothesis that  xxxg730xxx  may be in close
association with proteins forming functional complexes in the
t-tubular membrane. thus, we investigated in closer detail the
degree of association between  xxxg730xxx  and alpha-actinin in cardiomyocytes showing the continuous pattern.

3.5.1. high ppi between  xxxg730xxx  and alpha-actinin in cardiomyocytes
with  xxxg730xxx  “continuous” pattern
fig. 6g shows the plot of the psign value vs. cc of 1 mum2
regions of images in figs. 6a and b which corresponds to a
cardiomyocyte with a “continuous” pattern of  xxxg730xxx  ( xxxg831xxx  = 4.9).
the shadowed area depicts the regions with positive cc and with
p < 0.05. the large majority of the discrete regions show positive
cc values resulting in ppi = 0.70. this can be seen in the cc
distribution histogram showing the number of regions with
positive cc values >0 (fig. 5h, red columns). these data indicate
a high degree of correlation between the landscape intensities of
 xxxg730xxx  and alpha-actinin. to evaluate the spatial sensitivity of this

505

method, the graph in fig. 6i demonstrates the sharp ppi reduction
as function of a pixel shift of one of the images. the ppi was
reduced from 0.70 to 0.21 for a 0.059 mum shift (1 pixel) providing
an experimental determination of the localization precision. fig. 6j
illustrates that the high degree of ppi is maintained across the
various confocal planes of the cell.

with  xxxg730xxx  “granular” patter

d) ( xxxg831xxx  = 1.5). the overlays in panels c and f demonstrate that
 xxxg730xxx  distributes along the z lines marked by alpha-actinin but with a
less degree of overlap (yellow) when compared with the
cardiomyocyte having  xxxg730xxx  with a “continuous” pattern (fig.
5f). figs. 7g and h show that the vast majority of the regions
have negative cc values with ppi = 0.01.
we next examined whether there is a correlation between the
ppi of  xxxg730xxx  and alpha-actinin with the distribution pattern of  xxxg730xxx 
as measured by  xxxg831xxx . to this end, we determined ppi values for
 xxxg730xxx  and alpha-actinin in 45 cells from 3 different preparations. the
ppi distribution histogram of all cells (fig. 7i) shows two clear
populations with ppi mean values of 0.12 and 0.74. interestingly, the plot of ppi vs. xxxg831xxx  (fig. 7j) shows a high degree of

correlation (cc = 0.64; p < 0.05) between ppi and  xxxg831xxx  (red and
green squares correspond to cells in figs. 6 and 7, respectively)
indicating that the degree of association between  xxxg730xxx  and alphaactinin depends on the distribution pattern of  xxxg730xxx  being their
association higher in cardiomyocytes showing  xxxg730xxx  with the
“continuous” pattern.
3.6. trabecular distribution of nuclear  xxxg730xxx  and lack of
association with heterochromatin
 xxxg730xxx  is found in nuclei from tissue sections and isolated cells
(figs. 3a and b). fig. 8 illustrates that  xxxg730xxx  is not uniformly
distributed in the entire nucleus but it shows a trabecular pattern.

a.b. ropero et al. / journal of molecular and cellular cardiology 41 (2006) 496–510

double labeling with dapi (fig. 8b) and anti- xxxg730xxx  demonstrates that  xxxg730xxx  does not associate with heterochromatin which
is preferentially labeled by dapi (figs. 8c and d). this example
is from a cardiomyocyte with a “continuous” t-tubular pattern.
similar observations were found in cardiomyocytes with a
“granular”  xxxg730xxx  pattern. the ppi analysis in figs. 8e and f
shows a larger number of 1 mum2 regions having negative cc
confirming that  xxxg730xxx  and heterochromatin are mutually
excluded (ppi = 0.02 ± 0.007, n = 10 cells). these results

507

indicate that  xxxg730xxx  is excluded from transcriptionally silent dna
and support the view that, in cardiomyocytes,  xxxg730xxx  is an active
transcription factor associated with dna engaged in cardiac
genomic transcription [22].
3.7. effect of e2 on  xxxg730xxx  levels and nuclear pattern

isolated in the presence of e2 or the vehicle (4–5 h) until the cells

were fixed. in each experiment two hearts with and without e2
treatment were used. analysis was performed in 40 cells in each
condition in unprocessed images acquired with the same
confocal parameters as in fig. 8a.
figs. 9a and b illustrate the overall decrease in  xxxg730xxx  labeling
after 1 mum e2 treatment; magnified images are in panels c,d.
fluorescence intensity measurements (average intensity)
showed that both nuclear and non-nuclear  xxxg730xxx  labeling were
greatly decreased after e2 treatment by ∼50% (fig. 8e, n = 3).
similar results were obtained in one experiment using 10 nm
e2. these results suggest that both subpopulations of  xxxg730xxx  are
downregulated to the same extent by e2.
figs. 8c and d show that the  xxxg730xxx  nuclear pattern but not the
t-tubular pattern is altered by e2 treatment. for better visualization, images in panels c and d were deconvolved and contrasted
to the same level. after e2 treatment, nuclear  xxxg730xxx  seems to loose
the trabecular structure making more evident a punctate pattern.
these changes take place without obvious pattern modifications
in the  xxxg730xxx  t-tubular membranes. to evaluate this change in
nuclear pattern, we have applied the same procedure used to
quantify the degree of granular distribution in t-tubular  xxxg730xxx  (fig.
4) by plotting the %area above threshold vs. threshold. the
graph in fig. 9f illustrates one representative experiment showing
that 1 mum e2 treatment increases the steepness of reduction of %
area above threshold as function of threshold as expected from
the punctate  xxxg730xxx  pattern after e2 treatment. similar findings were
obtained in other 3 preparations (2 with 1 mum e2 and 1 with
10 nm e2).
4. discussion
this work shows that in male hearts from adult rats there are at
least two forms of  xxxg730xxx , the full-length 66 kda receptor and a new
 xxxg730xxx  cardiac form of approximately 45 kda. both proteins have
different subcellular distribution with the 66 kda being present
only in the cytosolic fraction, while the 45 kda form is enriched in
the crude membrane fraction. immunocytochemistry experiments
in whole heart sections and freshly isolated cardiomyocytes
demonstrated that  xxxg730xxx  could be located in several subcellular
compartments: nucleus, cytosol, plasma membrane, t-tubules,
and intercalated disks. in the nuclei,  xxxg730xxx  is excluded from the
heterochromatin. the treatment of hearts with e2 produced a
decrease in overall  xxxg730xxx  levels and made more evident the
accumulation of nuclear  xxxg730xxx  into smaller discrete areas without
noticeable changes in the  xxxg730xxx  t-tubular pattern.
several  xxxg730xxx  isoforms of molecular sizes <66 kda have been
observed in various tissues including 40–46 kda forms that may
arise from splice deletions [23,24], internal ribosomal entry [25],
or partial proteolysis. in rat heart, only two mrna deletion
variants of  xxxg730xxx  have been reported that predict proteins of
∼53 kda and 56 kda [23]. our results make unlikely that the
novel 45 kda heart isoform reported here is a degradation
product during the biochemical procedure. yet to be determined
alternative mechanisms underlying the cardiac 45 kda isoform
could be an unknown splice deletion variant, the usage of an
alternative start codon and/or a specific proteolytic product by a
native cellular mechanism.

 xxxg730xxx  receptor labeling that associated with intracellular
transversal structures, likely t-tubular membranes as shown by
their staining with the z-line associated protein alpha-actinin [20,21],
has two expression patterns that we referred to as “continuous”
and “granular.” these expression patterns could be differentiated
from the size of the area ( xxxg831xxx ) of the shallow 2nd exponential
component of the fit of %area above threshold vs. threshold
curves. we may speculate that these two distinct distribution
patterns may reflect a different compartmentalization and/or
functional state of  xxxg730xxx  receptors.
we have developed a new algorithm to quantify the degree of
association between two proteins, in this case  xxxg730xxx  and alpha-actinin,
by evaluating the cc of the intensity staining landscape of the two
images. we performed a discrete analysis in 1 mum2 regions and
calculated the ppi from the ratio between the number of regions
with cc > 0 and psign test < 0.05 and the total number of regions.
these measurements were made after deconvolution to reach the
optical resolution at the diffraction limit. furthermore, images
were taken at a high sampling frequency to maximize the position
precision. the plot of ppi vs. pixel shift demonstrates a large
reduction of ppi with 1 pixel shift (0.038 mum) which indicates the
degree of closeness resolved in these measurements. we found a
positive cc between ppi and the degree of “continuous” pattern:
the degree of association between  xxxg730xxx  and alpha-actinin was high in
cells with a “continuous” pattern and low in cells with a “granular”
pattern. this finding supports the view that  xxxg730xxx  can associate or
not with alpha-actinin depending on the cell subtype, and that  xxxg730xxx  can
be differentially compartmentalized in the transversal structures.
early studies identified alpha-actinin as a core component of the
dense bodies, thought to be the structural and functional analogs
of sarcomere z-discs; recently, a new picture is emerging for its
role as a multipurpose protein involved not only in shaping the
cells but also as a scaffold for signaling proteins [26]. in addition,
the cardiac alpha-actinin-2 can modulate the transcriptional activity of
nuclear receptors, including that of human  xxxg730xxx  [27]. thus, our
findings showing a close association of alpha-actinin with  xxxg730xxx  in a
subset of cardiomyocytes may suggest a role of alpha-actinin in the
regulation of  xxxg730xxx  function within a macromolecular complex
microenvironment.
 xxxg730xxx  labeling was detected at the plasma membrane and
intercalated disks of cardiomyocytes and its 45 kda isoform is
enriched in the heart crude membrane fraction. these results can
be interpreted as the 45 kda isoform being present in membrane
structures. the mechanism used by  xxxg730xxx  to locate to the plasma
membrane of cardiomyocytes is unknown. interestingly, a 46 kda
form of  xxxg730xxx  has been detected in the plasma membrane of human
endothelial cells being its membrane location dependent on
palmitoylation [28]. the location of  xxxg730xxx  on membrane structures
of cardiomyocytes reported here could have a critical role for the
rapid (non-genomic) e2 effects in heart [5].
recent work in microglial cells demonstrated that e2 can
upregulate proteasomal activity through the mapk pathway [29].
this is in agreement with the reported e2 induction of  xxxg730xxx 
proteolysis through the activation of the ubiquitin–proteasome
pathway [30–32]. although regulatory aspects of the heart
proteasome activity are yet unknown [33], one may speculate
that this organelle is involved in mediating e2-induced reduction

a.b. ropero et al. / journal of molecular and cellular cardiology 41 (2006) 496–510

of heart  xxxg730xxx  contributing to e2-mediated cardioprotection [6,7].
an alternative explanation of e2-induced reduction of  xxxg730xxx 
protein is by a decrease in  xxxg730xxx  mrna stability [34]. in any event,
our data indicate that short-term (4–5 h) e2 treatment reduces
cardiac  xxxg730xxx  content in a similar manner in the nucleus and nonnuclear regions suggesting a rather stable compartmentalization of
heart  xxxg730xxx  receptors without an apparent short-term nuclearcytoplasmic  xxxg730xxx  trafficking as reported in other systems [35].
thus, in rat heart, one of the cellular mechanisms of e2 action is
the downregulation of  xxxg730xxx  expression.
heart nuclear  xxxg730xxx  has a distinct trabecular distribution throughout the nucleus and as expected for an active transcription factor, it
is excluded from inactive dna forming the heterochromatin
(identified by intense dapi staining) [22]. interestingly, e2 treatment in addition to reducing the nuclear and non-nuclear  xxxg730xxx 
labeling, made more evident the accumulation of nuclear  xxxg730xxx  into
discrete nuclear spots in a similar manner as in  xxxg730xxx -gfp-transfected cell lines [36]. the spatial organization of  xxxg730xxx  suggests that
an underlying structure facilitates the partitioning of  xxxg730xxx  in
specific subnuclear domains that could be regulated by e2 resulting
in  xxxg730xxx  rearrangements facilitating its interaction with target genes.
the cardioprotection of women during reproductive years has
been proven for decades [37]. however, estrogens may also be
involved in cardiac protection in men as suggested by the cardiac
pathologies of  xxxg730xxx  knockout male mice, including longer qt
interval [38,39]. some of the protective effects of estrogens are
long-term effects, well in accordance with the role of estrogen
receptors as transcription factors. however, a large number of
studies show that estrogens can also produce rapid effects on the
heart mediated by non-genomic mechanisms [5]. these effects
are mainly on the excitation–contraction coupling machinery of
the cardiomyocytes. a decrease in heart rate, action potential
duration, and calcium currents has been seen within few minutes
of treatment with estrogen [8,40–45]. since the effects are mainly
the modulation of ion channels located at the plasma membrane or
t-tubules, the involvement of an e2 membrane receptor has been
speculated. our results provide a candidate  xxxg730xxx  membrane
receptor for mediating the rapid effects of estrogens in heart.
