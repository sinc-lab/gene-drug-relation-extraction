abstract

they decreased
both the affinity
and the number
of [3h]dex-binding
sites, increased
the dissociation
rate of [3h]dex
from the lags, and
provoked
a time- and dose-dependent
inactivation
of the [3h]dexbinding
site. these results strongly
suggest that st and da exert a
negative
allosteric
modulation
on [3h]dex
binding to the lags. the
in uiuo administration
of st (but not other androgens)
to male rats
provoked
a time- and dose-dependent
decrease in the lags level. full
recovery
of the lags
concentration
required
at least 8 h and was
blocked
by protein
synthesis
inhibitors.
such results suggest that st
irreversibly
inactivates
the [3h]dex-binding
site in uiuo as it does in

some 17a-alkylated
androgens
used as anabolic
agents, such as
stanozolol
(st) and  xxxd1806xxx 
(da),
have specific effects on the liver
that are not exerted by testosterone.
this gives rise to the possibility
that a steroid-binding
protein,
other than the androgen
receptor,
could
modulate
the intracellular
actions
of these agents.
male
rat liver
microsomes
contain a homogeneous
population
of [3h]dexamethasone
([3h]dex)-binding
sites which
we have denominated
low affinity
glucocorticoid-binding
sites (lags).
because glucocorticoids,
progestagens, and the synthetic
estrogen ethynyl
estradiol
compete with (3h]
dex for binding
to the lags, we aimed to study the possible interactions
between
androgens
and the lags.
to investigate
whether
several androgens
had the capability
of interacting
with the lags, we
performed
competition
experiments.
the lags
had no affinity
for
testosterone
or methyltrienolone
( xxxd2631xxx ).
however,
some 17a-alkylated androgens
(da (i&,
116 nm) > st >>  xxxd2136xxx 
> mestaline
> methandriol
>> methandrostenolone
> methyltestosterone)
were able to compete with [3h]dex
binding
to liver microsomes.
st
and da were potent inhibitors
of [3h]dex
binding to liver microsomes.

uitro.

together,
these observations
are indicative
of an irreversible
between some 17a-alkylated
androgens
and the lags both
in vitro and in uiuo and suggest that st may be an important
pharmacological
tool that can be used in the elucidation
of the molecular
structure
of the lags.
these results also mean that the lags are a
steroid-binding
entity
able to distinguish
between
natural
androgens
and 17a-alkylated
testosterone
derivatives
used as anabolic
agents.

t

he effects of androgens on the liver are well documented. they induce several hepatic proteins, e.g. (ye”globulin, carbonic anhydrase-iii, and cytochrome p-450h,
and repress the expression of other proteins, e.g. the senescence marker protein-2 (l-4). androgens act on the mammalian liver mainly through their binding to the androgen
receptor (ar) (5-7). however, several differences have been
reported between the effects on the liver of two commonly
used androgenic steroids, testosterone esters and 17a-alkylated androgens.
the 17cr-alkylated androgens (but not testosterone or testosterone esters) cause increases in the concentrations of
several plasmaglycoproteins that are synthesized in the liver,
such as some clotting factors and the inhibitor of the first
component of the complement (8-12). thesefindings suggest
that the specific effects of the 17a-alkylated androgens on

the liver cannot be mediated by the ar. if the 17a-alkylated
androgens could be shown to interact with steroid-binding
molecules other than the ar, it could help to clarify the
reasons for the different responses of the liver to these
compounds compared to the responses shown to natural
androgens. the low-affinity glucocorticoid-binding sites
(lags) are a possible candidate that could highlight these
differences.
the lags are entities present in the microsomal fraction
(13-24) and the nuclear envelopes of the rat liver (25-27).
although the lags have not been fully characterized, some
topics regarding their ontogeny, endocrine regulation, and
binding properties have been clarified. we have previously
shown that lags are very rare before puberty in the male
rat, but increase afterward and reach a peak at 2-3 months
of age (17). we have also shown that lags are subject to
endocrine regulation by thyroid hormones, glucocorticoids,
and gh (22, 23). the lags seemto form a unique classof
steroid-binding sites,capable of binding several steroidswith
relatively low affinity (ka, 20-300 nm), including glucocorticoids [prednisolone, cortisol, dexamethasone (dex), and corticosterone, but not  xxxd3418xxx  (ta)], progestagens (progesterone > r5020), and the synthetic estrogen

is known about the possible intracellular role of lags, it is
interesting to note that most of the steroids that they are
capable of binding have powerful effects on the liver.
because the lags bind eez, a 17a-alkylated estrogen, the
possibility that they might also interact with 17a-alkylated
androgens led us to investigate the effects of natural and
synthetic androgens on [3h]dex binding to the lags both
in vitro and in viva. the study included the 17~alkylated
androgens stanozolol (st) and  xxxd1806xxx  (da), which are
frequently used asanabolic agents. our results are consistent
with the hypothesis that the lags could modulate the
intracellular activity of several 17~alkylated androgens.

higher concentrations
of dcc could not achieve greater efectiveness.
in
the control experiments,
incubations
were carried out in the presence of
the vehicle alone (1% ethanol,
final concentration).
no effect of ethanol
was observed.
as many
different
steroids
were used during
the course of the
experiments,
we also tested an alternative
method
to make sure that
dcc treatment
of the samples
to remove
the unbound
steroid was
equally effective
with all of the steroids assayed. a suspension
of the
lipophilic
sm-2 beads (bio-rad,
richmond,

according
to
the protocol
described
by the manufacturer,
was used instead of the
dcc method to remove unbound
steroids. both methods yielded similar
results (data not shown).
therefore,
the dcc method
for removing
the
unbound
steroid was selected for the following
experiments.
when the rats were treated with steroids,
the microsomal
samples
were treated with dcc before the exchange assay to remove the steroids.
dcc was eliminated
by cenhifugation.

process over the concentration range of 10-1000 nm. scatchard analysis (fig. 1) of the binding isotherms (fig. 1, inset)
revealed that [3h]dex binds to a single classof low affinity
binding sites. the equilibrium dissociation constant (kd) was
100 f 6 nm, the maximal number of [3h]dex-binding sites
(b,,,) was 13 f 1 pmol/mg microsomal protein, and the hill

dose-dependent
effects of st and da on the saturation
binding of fh]dex
to the lags

as st and da showed the greatest inhibitory effect, the
binding parameters of [3h]dex to the lags were measured
in the presence of increasing concentrations (50-400 nm) of
these 17a-alkylated androgens. table 2 summarizes the
binding parameters of the [3h]dex binding to the lags in
the presenceor absenceof inhibitors.
as shown in scatchard plots (31) (fig. 3) of the binding
data, both affinity and b,,, decreased with increasing concentrations of either st or da. when the apparent dissociation constants (kd) were plotted against the concentration of
either st (fig. 3a, inset) or da (fig. 3b, inset), it was
observed that the kd values of [3h]dex increased nonlinearly
with increasing concentrations of both 17a-alkylated androgens, suggesting that the inhibition of [3h]dex binding induced by both st and da was noncompetitive.
when the data on binding in the presence of either st or
da were plotted in the form of lineweaver-burk plots (data
not shown), it was found that inhibition of [3h]dex binding
by both 17lu-alkylatedandrogens was a mixed noncompetitive type, i.e. both the affinity and b,,, of [3h]dex were
lowered along the entire range of concentrations tested. a

rate of

the observation that st and da decreasethe affinity and
maximal binding of [3h]dex to the microsomes of the male
rat liver led us to investigate their effects on a kinetic constant, the dissociation rate constant (k-i).
the rate of dissociation of [3h]dex from its complex with
lags was studied in the presenceof unlabeled steroids (fig.
4 and table 3). da and st significantly increased the k.1 of
the [3h]dex-lags complex up to 1.6-2.3 times, respectively,
and reduced the t112approximately 2 times compared to
unlabeled dex. the ability of some 17a-alkylated androgens
(e.g. st, da,  xxxd2136xxx , and mestaline) to enhance
the k-i of [3h]dex from the lags strongly suggeststhat
their site of action is different from the [3h]dex-binding site
and agrees with the noncompetitive type of inhibition induced by the 17a-alkylated androgens. it also suggeststhat
the 17a-alkylated androgens, through their binding to this
secondsite, change the conformation of the [3h]dex-binding
site to reduce its affinity for the glucocorticoid, i.e. a negative
allosterism.

microsomal
samples were preincubated
for
2 h with vehicle (a) or increasing
concentrations
[50 (ii), 100 (w), 200
(o), or 400 (0) nm] of either st (a) or da (b). [3h]dex
binding to
liver microsomal
supensions
was then measured
as described
in fig. 1.
insets, the apparent
kd values were plotted against st (a) or da (b)
concentrations.
the data are representative
of six separate
experiments.
table
2 gives the binding
parameters
for [3h]dex
in the
presence or absence of 17cu-alkylated
androgens.

somal samples were preincubated for 5 min with 0.4 pm of
either st or da. after this initial effect, longer preincubation
of microsomal samples with st or da resulted in a slight,
but progressive, decreasein [3h]dex binding. this decrease
was time and dose dependent for both st (fig. 5) and da
(data not shown). when these studies were performed at 25
c, identical results were obtained (data not shown).
in the samples preincubated with either st or da, the
extremely rapid fall in [3h]dex binding is compatible with
the negative allosterism described previously. it also suggests
a very high affinity of the second binding site for both st or
da and/or an irreversible inactivation of the [3h]dex-binding site (40). therefore, in a separate seriesof experiments,
the reversibility of both st and da (data not shown) inhibition of [3h]dex binding to microsomeswas explored. the
results of these studies are summarized in table 4.

the value of specific [3h]dex binding to membranes assayed under control conditions was arbitrarily set at 100%.
incubation of membranes with buffer at either 0 or 25 c,
followed by four dcc steps, produced no significant decrease in the control binding activity. a 7 h (at 0 c) or 90
min (at 25 c), preincubation with 2 pm dex without subsequent dcc steps essentially abolished all [3h]dex binding,
as would be expected; however, when the membranes that
were preincubated with 2 pm dex were subsequently treated
four times with dcc, the specific [3h]dex-binding activity
measured after the dcc steps was at the level of control
values. this observation was also predictable, because the
association of dex with its binding sites (i.e. lags) is a
reversible process.
a 2-h (at 0 c) or 20-min (at 25 c) preincubation with 0.4
pm st produced 60% inhibition of specific [3h]dex binding
to the membranes. this inhibition was apparently irreversible, as evidenced by the fact that st inhibition of specific
[3h]dex binding to the membranes was 40% of the control
value after four repeated dcc steps.

both time-course
and a dose-response
experiments
in vivo.
for the time-course
experiment,
groups of rats were injected with st and killed at the times stated in fig. 6. these
results suggest that the st administration
decreases the liver
microsome
concentration
of lags. the maximal
decrease
(70 + 10%) was obtained 2 h after st administration,
and at
least 8 h were needed to recover the basal lags concentration.
we next determined
whether
the recovery of lags after
st treatment depends on protein synthesis. an experiment
was designed in which groups of rats received one of the
following
treatments: sc injection of 0.1 ml corn oil (vehicle)
containing
10% (vol/vol)
ethanol,
sc injection
of a single
dose of st (1 mg/loo g bw), ip injection
of cycloheximide
(chx; 4 mg/kg .6 h), or sc injection
of st plus ip injection
of chx. the lags level again decreased (70% lower than
control at 2 h) after treatment
with st and recovered
its
initial level after 8 h. the lags level also decreased slowly
after chx injection (35% lower than the control value at 8
h). however, when st and chx were injected together, the
lags decrease was more intense than treatment with chx
alone, and they remained
at the same low level (70% lower
than control) after 8 h, in contrast to the effect of st alone
(data not shown). this finding indicates that the recovery of
the lags level after st treatment depends on protein synthesis. the effect of chx alone suggest that lags have a
t,/* shorter than that of the glucocorticoid
receptor
(gr),
whose concentration
is not affected by chx treatment (17).
the observed decrease in lags was also a dose-dependent effect. as shown in fig. 7, the decrease in the hepatic
level of lags was dependent
on the dose of st administered. when steroids other than st (e.g. da, mibolerone,
dihydrotestosterone,
testosterone
propionate,
mestaline,
dex, cortisol, or prednisolone)
were assayed, none of them
proved effective in lowering
the level of lags.

discussion
androgens
can act directly
on the liver through
their
binding
to the ar (1, 5-7). however,
the 17a-alkylated
androgens
have specific effects on the expression of several
hepatic proteins, which are not exerted by testosterone,
thus
suggesting that these effects are not mediated by the ar (812). although
the use of 17a-alkylated
androgens
is frequently associated with hepatotoxicity,
the exact mechanism
by which the 17cy-alkylated androgens
act on the liver is still
unknown
(32, 33).
the present results show that the rat liver microsomal
lags interact with some 17cy-alkylated androgens.
the fact
that the lags do not bind testosterone
or  xxxd2631xxx  allows us
to discard the possibility
that they could be a microsomal
form of the ar. microsomal
binding
sites for steroids have
previously
been described
in the rat liver [progesteronebinding
sites (28, 34), dex-binding
sites (13-24), and estrogen-binding
sites (28, 35)]. the results described here and
those previously reported by our laboratory
(17) make lags
the only known
entity capable of binding
four types of
steroid hormones with similar affinity: glucocorticoids
(prednisolone
> cortisol > corticosterone
= dex), progestagens
(progesterone
> r5020), the synthetic estrogen  xxxd2054xxx , and 17aalkylated
androgens
(da > st >>  xxxd2136xxx 
> mestaline > methandriol
> methyltestosterone).
the interaction
of lags with some 17cy-alkylated androgens (e.g. st and da) seems to be complex. competition
experiments
show that the 17a-alkylated
androgens compete
with [3h]dex for binding
to lags with variable affinity,
and some steroids show a cooperative
pattern of interaction
with lags. these results suggest that the lags may be
formed by multiple interacting
steroid-binding
sites.
changes in [3h]dex binding to the lags in the presence
of increasing
concentrations
of st and da were evident;

17~alkylated

androgens

both the affinity and the b,,, decreased. the reduction in
b,,, may be due to either 1) the 17a-alkylated
androgens
binding to a second site, which exerts a negative allosteric
influence on the [3h]dex-binding
site; or 2) an irreversible
binding of 17a-alkylated androgens to the [3h]dex-binding
site.
some steroid-binding proteins show allosteric modulation
by molecules other than their natural ligands. a well known
example of allosteric inhibition of [3h]dex binding is provided by the interaction of progesterone or unsaturated fatty
acids with the rat liver gr by acting on a different binding
site from that of the glucocorticoid (36-38). the fact that the
k,, of [3h]dex varied nonlinearly as a function of increasing
st or da concentrations clearly supports an allosteric modulation of the lags. studies of the k.r also showed that
some 17a-alkylated androgens, e.g. st, da,  xxxd2136xxx , and mestaline, increased the dissociation of [3h]dex
from the lags. these results further suggest that the 17~
alkylated androgens bind to a second site different from the
dex-binding site.
it has been suggested that the covalent attachment to
specific proteins is a mechanism for the action of many
biologically active molecules that also bind to specific receptors, e.g. 17@estradiol, thyroid hormones, or progesterone
(39). part of the [3h]dex-binding capacity of the liver microsomes seems to be irreversibly damaged by preincubating
the microsomes with st and, to a lesser extent, with da.
this [3h]dex-binding
site modulation occurs in seconds,
which implies that the st and da interaction with the lags
is a strong reaction, perhaps irreversible (40). the fact that
short term treatment with st decreases the concentration of
lags, and protein synthesis is required to recover the basal
level of lags strongly suggest that st irreversibly inactivates
the [3h]dex-binding
site in vim as it does in vitro. the
observed differences between st and da on the lags level
in vim suggest that st, unlike da, forms a higher affinity
ligand complex that irreversibly
modulates the [3h]dexbinding site.
unlike testosterone esters, it is believed that 17cu-alkylated
androgens act within the cell as such, i.e. the alkyl groups
are not removed before the hormones act within the cells
(32). the implication of the ar lowering the lags level
after in uiuo st treatment is not obvious, as other androgens
tested do not cause such effects. androgens are known to
interact with gr, progesterone receptors, and, to a lesser
extent, estrogen receptors (41-43). however, the role of these
well characterized steroid receptors in explaining the effect
that st, unlike testosterone and the other 17cu-alkylated
androgens tested, exerts on the lags is at present unknown.
information on the interaction of st and da with microsomal proteins is very limited. in the rat liver, st has been
described to interact with cytochrome p-450 by forming a
high affinity ligand complex, compatible with a noncompetitive inhibition type (44). in contrast, the inhibitory effects
of st and da on other microsomal proteins, e.g. testicular
microsomal oxygenase, are competitive (45, 46). it is known
that chronic administration of da to male rats decreases the
hepatic microsomal cytochrome p-450 content (47). identical

experiments performed in our laboratory showed that da
did not modify the b,,, of [3h]dex binding to microsomes
from treated animals, suggesting that the lags are not
related to the cytochrome p-450 enzymes (data not shown).
because the intracellular role of the lags is not known,
the biological meaning of their interaction with the 17~
alkylated androgens cannot be deduced from the present
results. these interactions and other properties of the lags
previously described, do not allow us to conclude that they
can mediate genomic actions of the 17a-alkylated androgens.
however, our findings suggest that the 17a-alkylated androgens may exert some effects on the liver through a nonreceptor-mediated mechanism. the reported results also show that
st has a particular interaction with the lags not shared by
other 17~alkylated
androgens.
in summary, we have found evidence of interaction between some 17a-alkylated androgens and the lags in vitro.
as far as we know, the present results make the lags the
only known entity able to discriminate between natural and
some 17a-alkylated
androgens. these findings may be of
help in understanding the observed differences between the
effects of testosterone esters and those of some 17~alkylated
androgens in the liver.
