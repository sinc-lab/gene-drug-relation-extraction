 xxxd3564xxx : new drug. no advantage in refractory partial epilepsy.  (1) the first-line treatment for patients with partial epilepsy is carbamazepine monotherapy. second-line options include monotherapy with  xxxd3485xxx , gabapentin, lamotrigine or  xxxd2809xxx . other antiepileptics are also available for combination therapy of refractory partial epilepsy. (2)  xxxd3564xxx  is a sulphonamide derivative that inhibits carbonic anhydrase; it resembles topiramate, a drug already approved for use for this indication in the european union. (3) the main clinical trial, a double-blind study lasting 36 weeks, compared the addition of  xxxd3564xxx  or placebo to ongoing treatment in 351 patients with refractory partial epilepsy. the "response rate" (the proportion of patients with at least a 50% reduction in the frequency of seizures) was significantly higher with  xxxd3564xxx  plus the previous treatment than with placebo plus the previous treatment (46.6% versus 17.6%). an indirect comparison suggests that this is no better than treatment with a second-line antiepileptic drug. (4) results of three other placebo-controlled trials of third-line combinations in a total of 499 patients treated for 12 weeks were similar. (5) the main adverse effects of  xxxd3564xxx  are those typically seen with topiramate: neuropsychological disorders and disorders due to carbonic anhydrase inhibition (kidney stones, reduced perspiration, and hyperthermia). there are various other adverse effects, including a risk of severe skin rash. (6) the profile of interactions is complex. there is a risk of pharmacokinetic interactions, and of pharmacodynamic interactions with other carbonic anhydrase inhibitors. (7) in france, treatment with  xxxd3564xxx  costs nearly 20 times more than treatment with carbamazepine or  xxxd3485xxx . (8)  xxxd3564xxx  has no therapeutic advantages over other antiepileptics available for combination therapy of partial epilepsy.
