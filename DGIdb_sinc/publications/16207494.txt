abstract
in the present study, age-related changes of pyridoxal 50 -phosphate (plp) synthesizing enzymes,  xxxg1720xxx  (plk) and pyridoxine 50 phosphate oxidase ( xxxg1793xxx ), their protein contents and activities were examined in the gerbil hippocampus proper. significant age-dependent
changes in plk and  xxxg1793xxx  immunoreactivities were found in the ca1 region, but not in the ca2/3 region. in the postnatal month 1 (pm 1) group,
plk and  xxxg1793xxx  immunoreactivities were detected mainly in the stratum pyramidale of the ca1 region. plk and  xxxg1793xxx  immunoreactivities and
their protein contents were highest in the pm 6 group, showing that many ca1 pyramidal cells had strong plk and  xxxg1793xxx  immunoreactivities.
thereafter, plk and  xxxg1793xxx  immunoreactivities started to decrease and were very low at pm 24. alterations in the change patterns in protein
contents and total activities of plk and  xxxg1793xxx  corresponded to the immunohistochemical data, but their specific activities were not altered in any
experimental group. based on double immunofluorescence study, plk and  xxxg1793xxx  immunoreactive cells in the strata oriens and radiatum were
identified as gabaergic cells. therefore, decreases of plk and  xxxg1793xxx  in the hippocampal ca1 region of aged brains may be involved in aging
processes related with  xxxd2177xxx  (gaba) function.

1. introduction
it has been reported that  xxxg1360xxx 
immunoreactivity is significantly decreased in the hippocampal
ca1 region of 59-week-old mice. this result means that
dendrites and axons in the hippocampal ca1 neurons are
particularly susceptible to aging processes (himeda et al.,
2005). the balance of glutamate and  xxxd2177xxx 
(gaba) in the neurons is very important in maintenance of
hippocampal neurons. an abnormal gaba function is related

with various neurological disorders such as depression
(tunnicliff and malatynska, 2003), epilepsy (houser, 1991;
kang et al., 2001a,b, 2002a,c), schizophrenia (reynolds et al.,
2001; heckers et al., 2002), parkinsonism (calabresi et al.,
2000) and cerebral ischemia (arabadzisz and freund, 1999;
kang et al., 2002b). moreover, it has been suggested that
gaba is involved in a number of cerebral functions that
become altered with age, such as learning and memory,
emotion and motivation, and motor functions (cook and
sepinwall, 1975; marczynski et al., 1994). hence, the
metabolic pathway of gaba is of much importance in terms
of aging processes.
gaba is formed from glutamate by the action of two
 xxxg913xxx  (gad) isoforms,  xxxg850xxx  and  xxxg849xxx

tetraacetic acid (edta), 1 mm 2- xxxd26xxx  and 1 mm phenylmethyl
sulfonyl fluoride (pmsf). the individual 25% (w/v) homogenates were
centrifuged  xxxd1891xxx ,000  g for 1 h. five microliters of each supernatant was
mixed with an equal volume of a 2 sds-sample buffer and boiled for 3 min.
the cooled samples were applied to a sds-page and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. the blots were processed by the procedures described in
western blot.
in order to establish the specificity of the immunostaining, a negative
control test was carried out with pre-immune serum instead of the primary
antibody. the negative control test was conducted in all groups.

(esclapez and houser, 1999; fukuda et al., 1998; kang et al.,
2001a). and, gad activity is regulated by a cycle of activation
and inactivation determined by the binding and release of its
cofactor pyridoxal 50 -phosphate (plp), and plp is catalyzed by
 xxxg1720xxx  (plk) or pyridoxine 50 -phosphate oxidase
( xxxg1793xxx ) (choi et al., 1987; erlander et al., 1991; erlander and
tobin, 1991).
the metabolism of plp has been studied extensively in
normal tissues in several laboratories (bahn et al., 2002; choi
et al., 1987; kwok and churchich, 1980). plp is formed in
mammalian cells by the phosphorylation of pyridoxal by plk
( xxxg1720xxx ) or by the oxidation of pnp or by the oxidation of
pyridoxamine-5-phosphate (pmp) by the cytosolic enzyme
 xxxg1793xxx  ( xxxg1793xxx ).
the mongolian gerbil provides an ideal opportunity for
studying the mechanisms of epileptogenesis (kang et al.,
2001a) and delayed neuronal death after transient forebrain
ischemia (kang et al., 2002b). recently, we reported that plk
and  xxxg1793xxx  immunoreactivities were significantly lower in a
30 min postictal group than that in a pre-seizure group (kang
et al., 2002a,c). in addition, we found that gad isoform
immunoreactivities were elevated markedly in the hippocampal
ca1 region at 30 min after 5 min of transient forebrain
ischemia. moreover, at 3–12 h after transient ischemia, their
immunoreactivities recovered to the sham level (kang et al.,
2001b). thus, our findings suggest that the differential
alterations of gaba metabolism might be one of the important
factors of the neuronal damage induced by ischemia. because
we used only 3–4 months gerbils in these studies, we were not
able to determine whether aging influences gaba metabolism.
this issue must be resolved by studying the relationships
between gaba metabolism and age-related dysfunction in the
hippocampus at various ages.
in this study, we first identified age-dependent changes in
plk and  xxxg1793xxx  immunoreactivities, in their protein contents
and in their activities in the hippocampus proper at various ages
in a gerbil model.

seven gerbils in each group were anesthetized by injecting sodium
pentobarbital (40 mg/kg body weight, i.p.) and perfused transcardially with
0.1 m phosphate-buffered saline (pbs, ph 7.4) containing 0.1% sodium nitrite
and 1 u/100 ml of heparin, followed by 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 m pb
(ph 7.4). after perfusion, forebrains with the hippocampus were removed,
post-fixed for 4–6 h in the same fixative at 4 8c and stored in a 30% phosphatebuffered sucrose solution for 12–24 h. serial coronal sections of 30 mm
thickness were cut with a freezing microtome, and immunohistochemically
processed by using the free floating method (hwang et al., 2004a,d).
the sections were sequentially treated with 0.3%  xxxd2298xxx 
(h2o2) in pbs for 30 min, incubated in 10% normal horse serum in pbs
for 30 min, and in diluted mouse anti-plk (hwang et al., 2004c; kang et al.,
2002a) and anti- xxxg1793xxx  (bahn et al., 2002; kang et al., 2002c) for 48 h at 4 8c.
thereafter, the sections were exposed to biotinylated anti-mouse igg (diluted
1:200; vector, usa) and streptavidin peroxidase complex (diluted 1:200;
vector). they were then visualized with 3,30 -diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride (dab; fluka, usa) and  xxxd2298xxx  in 0.1 m  xxxd3449xxx 
(ph 7.4).

2. materials and methods

2.5. western blot analysis

2.1. experimental animals

rat, mouse and gerbils in each group, which are mentioned above, were
used in this immunoblot study. after sacrifice and removal of the hippocampus, the tissues were homogenized in 50 mm tris containing 50 mm n-2hydroxyethylpiperazine-n0 -2-ethanesulfonic acid (hepes) (ph 7.4), 0.1 mm
ethylene glycol bis (2-aminoethyl ether)-n,n,n0 ,n0 tetraacetic acid (egta)
(ph 8.0), 0.2% np-40, 10 mm edta (ph 8.0), 15 mm sodium pyrophosphate,
100 mm b-glycerophosphate, 50 mm naf, 150 mm nacl, 2 mm sodium
orthvanadate, 1 mm pmsf and 1 mm dithiothreitol (dtt). after centrifugation  xxxd1891xxx ,000  g, the protein concentration was determined in the supernatants by using the micro bca protein assay kit with bovine  xxxg124xxx 
as the standard (pierce chemical, usa). aliquots containing 20 mg total
protein were boiled in loading buffer containing 150 mm tris (ph 6.8), 3 mm
dtt, 6% sds, 0.3% bromophenol blue and 30% glycerol. then, each aliquot
was loaded onto a 10% polyacryamide gel. after electrophoresis, the gels were
transferred to nitrocellulose transfer membranes (schleicher and schuell,
usa). to reduce background staining, the filters were incubated with 5%
non-fat dry milk in pbs containing 0.1% tween 20 for 45 min, followed by
incubation with mouse anti-plk antiserum (1:500) or anti- xxxg1793xxx  antiserum
(1:500), with peroxidase conjugated anti-mouse igg (sigma, usa), and then
with ecl kit (amersham, usa).

we used the progeny of mongolian gerbils (meriones unguiculatus)
obtained from the experimental animal center, hallym university,
chunchon, south korea, at postnatal month 1 (pm 1) (n = 14), pm 3
(n = 14), pm 6 (n = 14), pm 12 (n = 14) and pm 24 (n = 14). the animals
were housed at constant temperature (23 8c) and relative humidity (60%)
with a fixed 12-h light:12-h dark cycle and free access to food and water.
procedures involving animals and their care were conformed to the institutional guidelines, which are in compliance with current international laws and
policies (nih guide for the care and use of laboratory animals, nih
publication no. 85-23, 1985, revised 1996) and were approved by the
hallym’s medical center institutional animal care and use committee.
all the experiments were conducted to minimize the number of animals used
and suffering.

2.2. confirm of antibody specificity
animal brains from rats, mice and gerbils were removed and homogenized
in a 10 mm phosphate buffer (pb) containing 0.1 mm ethylenediamine

2.3. tissue processing and immunohistochemistry

2.4. double immunofluorescence study
to confirm the neuronal type containing plk and  xxxg1793xxx  immunoreactivities, double immunofluorescence staining for both the mouse anti-plk
antiserum (1:25) or mouse anti- xxxg1793xxx  antiserum (1:25) and the rabbit antigad (diluted 1:200; chemicon, usa) was performed. sections were incubated in the mixture of antisera overnight at room temperature. after washing
three times for 10 min with pbs, the sections were also incubated in a mixture
of both cy3-conjugated goat anti-mouse igg (1:200; jackson immunoresearch, usa) and fitc-conjugated goat anti-rabbit igg (1:600; jackson
immunoresearch) for 2 h at room temperature. the immunoreactions were
observed under the axioscope microscope attached hbo100 (carl zeiss,
germany).

2.6. enzymatic assay
seven animals in each group (the same animals in western blot analysis)
were used in this enzymatic assay. plk and  xxxg1793xxx  from gerbil hippocampus
were purified according to a procedure of kerry et al. (1986) using a combination of deae-cellulose, and affinity chromatography and g-100 gel filtration.
enzymatic activity was measured by following change in absorbance at 388 nm,
at which plk and  xxxg1793xxx  have an absorption coefficient of 4900 cm1 m1 at
ph 7.0. initial rate measurements were carried out by monitoring the change in
absorbance at 388 nm for at least 3 min in a double beam spectrophotometer.
the standard assay mixture was to measure plk and  xxxg1793xxx  activity contained
0.07 m potassium phosphate (ph 6.5), pyrodoxal (0.1 mm), atp (0.1 mm) and
 xxxd3556xxx  (0.05 mm).

2.7. quantification of data and statistical analysis
all measurements were performed in order to ensure objectivity in blind
conditions, by two observers for each experiment, carrying out the measures
of control and experimental sections at the same moment in the same
day.
for quantitative analyses of plk and  xxxg1793xxx  immunoreactivities in the
hippocampus proper, 15 sections per animal were randomly selected within the

fig. 1. specificity of plk and  xxxg1793xxx  antibodies from rat, mouse, gerbil and
negative control (nc). note that only one immunoblot is shown in 39 kda (a)
and 30 kda (b), respectively.

corresponding levels of the hippocampus proper. at a magnification of 25–50,
the regions were outlined on the monitor and measured their areas. all the plk
and  xxxg1793xxx  immunoreactive structures taken from three layers (strata oriens,
pyramidale and radiatum in the hippocampus proper) were obtained through an
axiophot light microscope (carl zeiss) connected via ccd camera to a pc
monitor. video images were digitized into an array of 512  512 pixels
corresponding to a tissue area of 140 mm  140 mm (40 primary magnification). to evaluate the plk and  xxxg1793xxx  immunoreactive fibers and neurons, the

immunoreactivity is detected mainly in the stratum pyramidale (sp). note that some neurons (arrows) in the strata oriens (so) and radiatum (sr) show plk
immunoreactivity. at pm 3 (b), plk immunoreactivity is increased compared to the pm 1 group. in the pm 6 group (c), plk immunoreactivity is significantly
increased compared to the pm 3 group. note that many pyramidal cells in the sp show strong plk immunoreactivity, and some neurons (arrows) in the so and sr
show strong plk immunoreactivity. at pm 12 (d), plk immunoreactivity is similar to that in the pm1 group. in the pm 24 group (e), plk immunoreactivity is
reduced significantly compared to the pm1 group. bar = 200 mm.

plk and  xxxg1793xxx  immunolabeled fibers or neurons were selected by the imagej
software by interactively determining each cell limit.
each pixel resolution was of 256 gray levels. the intensities of plk and
 xxxg1793xxx  immunoreactivities were evaluated by means of a relative optical density
(rod) value. as it was previously described (ramos et al., 2000; tagliaferro
et al., 1997), rod was obtained after transformation of mean gray values into
rod using the formula: rod = log(256/(mean gray)). a background parameter was obtained from each section out of the immunolabeled structures and
subtracted from each cell rod value before statistically processing the obtained
values. rod values are informed as rod units. also, the results of the western
blot study were scanned and a rod value was obtained using scion image
software (nih).
four to six separate immunohistochemical experiments were run for each
primary antibody. individual experiment was composed of 6–10 tissue sections
of each animal from each group. five to 10 fields were measured for each area in
each section of each animal. interanimal differences in each group, as well as
interexperiment differences, were not statistically significant. shown values
represent the means of experiments performed for each marker and each area.
differences among the means were statistically analyzed by one-way analysis
of variance followed by the duncan’s new multiple range method or newman–
keuls test to elucidate the age-related changes of  xxxg1793xxx  and plk or to
investigate the age-differences between pm1 and other groups. p < 0.05
was considered significant.

3.1. specificity of plk and  xxxg1793xxx  antibody in rat, mouse
and gerbil brain
in order to examine the specificity of the plk and  xxxg1793xxx 
antibody, brain homogenates from rat, mouse and gerbils were
immunoblotted with the plk and  xxxg1793xxx  antibody. these
antibodies reacted with a single-protein band of 39 and 30 kda,
respectively (fig. 1a and b). in the pre-serum treated negative
study, plk or  xxxg1793xxx  immunoreactivity was not detected in any
structures (data not shown).

 xxxg1793xxx  immunoreactivity is observed mainly in the stratum pyramidale (sp). at this age stage, some neurons (arrows) in the strata oriens (so) and radiatum (sr) show
 xxxg1793xxx  immunoreactivity. at pm 3 (b),  xxxg1793xxx  immunoreactivity is increased as compared with the pm 1 group. at pm 6 (c),  xxxg1793xxx  immunoreactivity is significantly
increased as compared with the pm 3 group. in this group, strong  xxxg1793xxx  immunoreactivity appears in many pyramidal cells and in some neurons (arrows) in the so
and sr. at pm 12 (d),  xxxg1793xxx  immunoreactivity is decreased compared to the pm 6 group. in the pm 24 group (e),  xxxg1793xxx  immunoreactivity is significantly decreased
compared to the pm1 group. bar = 200 mm.

changes of plk immunoreactivity in the hippocampal ca1
region were very similar to that of  xxxg1793xxx  immunoreactivity in
all groups (figs. 2, 3 and 5).
in the pm 1 group, plk and  xxxg1793xxx  immunoreactivities were
detected mainly in the stratum pyramidale of the ca1 region
(figs. 2a and 3a). in the pm 3 group, plk and  xxxg1793xxx 
immunoreactivities were increased slightly in the stratum
pyramidale of the ca1 region as compared with the pm 1 group
(figs. 2b, 3b and 5).
at pm 6, plk and  xxxg1793xxx  immunoreactivities were
significantly increased and peaked in the ca1 region
(figs. 2c, 3c and 5). in this group, many ca1 pyramidal
cells showed strong plk and  xxxg1793xxx  immunoreactivities. at this
age stage, strong plk and  xxxg1793xxx  immunoreactivities were
detected in a few neurons in the strata oriens and radiatum
(figs. 2c and 3c).
in the pm 12 group, the immunodensity of plk and  xxxg1793xxx 
immunoreactivities in the ca1 region were decreased as
compared with the pm 6 group (figs. 2d, 3d and 5). in this
group, the plk and  xxxg1793xxx  immunoreactivities were similar to
that of pm1 group (fig. 5). in the pm 24 group, plk and  xxxg1793xxx 
immunoreactivities in the ca1 region were significantly

decreased compared to that in the pm 1 group (figs. 2e, 3e
and 5). in addition, these immunoreactivities in the pm 24
group were significantly decreased compared to that of the pm1
group. at this age stage, plk immunoreactive neurons were
not detectable in the ca1 region (fig. 2e), and a few  xxxg1793xxx 
immunoreactive neurons were detected in the strata oriens and
radiatum of the ca1 region (fig. 3e).
3.2.2. ca2/3 region
in all the experimental groups, weak plk and  xxxg1793xxx 
immunoreactivities in the hippocampal ca2/3 region were
detected and these immunoreactivities were not significantly
changed with age (fig. 4).
3.3. colocalization of plk/gad and  xxxg1793xxx /gad
in the pm 6 group, plk and  xxxg1793xxx  immunoreactivities in
the ca1 region were highest in all the experimental groups
(figs. 2c, 3c and 5). in this group, many ca1 pyramidal cells
as well as non-pyramidal cells showed strong plk and
 xxxg1793xxx  immunoreactivities. based on the double immunofluorescence study, plk immunoreactive non-pyramidal cells were

in the present study, reverse ‘‘u’’ shaped patterns of plk

aliquots (fig. 7). the result of western bolt study showed that
the patterns of plk and  xxxg1793xxx  expressions were similar to
those of immunohistochemical data at various aged groups. the
relative optical densities of plk and  xxxg1793xxx  in the western blot
study were elevated significantly at pm 6 (fig. 7). thereafter,
the protein contents of plk and  xxxg1793xxx  were decreased
significantly by pm 24 (fig. 7).

highest at pm 6. thereafter, the total activities of plk and
 xxxg1793xxx  were decreased significantly by pm 24 (fig. 8).

3.5. changes in plk and  xxxg1793xxx  activities

4. discussion

in this study, we examined plk and  xxxg1793xxx  activities in the
hippocampus proper at various age stages. specific plk and
 xxxg1793xxx  activities (0.0027–0.0031 u/mg protein) were not
altered in all the experimental groups (fig. 8). however, total
activities of plk and  xxxg1793xxx  were increased significantly and

because phosphorylated forms of  xxxd3049xxx  do not easily
cross the blood–brain barrier (spector and greenwald, 1978),
plp within the brain tissue is essential for the synthesis of
gaba. hence, increase of plp is directly correlated with
intracellular gaba levels.

brain gad catalyzes the synthesis of the inhibitory
transmitter gaba, and gad requires the cofactor plp for
its activity. elucidation of gad–cofactor interactions is
essential to the understanding of gad regulation. the brain
contains two isoforms of gad with molecular masses of 65 and
67 kda, named  xxxg850xxx  and  xxxg849xxx  (bu et al., 1992; erlander
et al., 1991). rat  xxxg850xxx  and  xxxg849xxx  share an overall identity
of 65%. in their c-termini, the two isoforms share 73% identity
and are highly conserved. however, in the n-termini, they share
only 23% identity (chen et al., 2003). the two isoforms of
gad are derived from two different genes and differ in amino
acid sequence and in cellular and subcellular locations (bu
et al., 1992; erlander et al., 1991).  xxxg850xxx  is present primarily
in axon terminals, and is much less saturated by its cofactor
(kaufman et al., 1991; martin and rimvall, 1993). in contrast,
 xxxg849xxx  is widely distributed throughout neurons, and is highly
saturated by its cofactor in brain extracts. an understanding of
the difference in the saturation of plp in  xxxg850xxx  and  xxxg849xxx 
and of its implication in the regulation of gad activity requires
a comparative elucidation of cofactor interactions with  xxxg850xxx 
and  xxxg849xxx  (chen et al., 2003). gad with bound plp
(holoenzyme) decarboxylates glutamate to form gaba, but it
also catalyzes a transamination reaction that produces inactive
apogad (without bound plp). the apoenzyme can reassociate

hippocampus proper at various age stages. there is no statistical difference in
the specific activity between experimental groups. however, the total activity is
increased at pm 6 group, and thereafter the total activity is decreased.

with plp to form hologad, thus completing the cycle. hence,
the modulation of plp is important in terms of intracellular
gaba concentrations.
gerbils are gent and easy to handle, and can be maintained in
standard animal fanilities with the minimum of card. the mean
survival (50%) survival of male gerbils was 110 weeks; of
females, 139 weeks. the oldest surviving male was 208 weeks;
oldest female, 209 weeks (troup et al., 1969). in recent years,
the life span of gerbils becomes longer than that in the past.
some investigators reported that the life span of gerbils is 24–
36 months (langemann et al., 1999; schmiedt et al., 1990). in
the present study, we adapted 24-month-old gerbils for aged
group.
in the present study, we investigated the age-dependent
changes of the plp synthesizing enzymes, plk and  xxxg1793xxx , in
the hippocampus proper at various age stages in a gerbil model
to identify the relationship between gaba and its cofactor,
plp. significant age-dependent changes of plk immunoreactivity, their protein contents and total activities were
observed in the hippocampal ca1 region, but not in the
ca2/3 region. changes in  xxxg1793xxx  were similar to that of plk. in
addition, in the present study, we confirmed that the specific
activities of plk and  xxxg1793xxx  in the hippocampus proper were
not altered in all experimental groups. these results suggest
that the bioavailability of plp is not altered with aging.
however, the total activities of plk and  xxxg1793xxx  in the
hippocampal ca1 region were increased in the pm 6 group. we
also observed that the immunodensities or protein contents of

i.k. hwang et al. / mechanisms of ageing and development 126 (2005) 1322–1330

plk and  xxxg1793xxx  were significantly increased at pm 6.
thereafter, the immunodensities and protein contents of
plk and  xxxg1793xxx  significantly reduced age-dependently to
pm 24. this result strongly suggests that plp may increase by
pm 6, and thereafter decease gradually. our results are
supported by a previous study which found that gaba levels in
the gerbil hippocampus are significantly increased between pm
5 and pm 10, and thereafter they decrease (delbarre et al.,
1992). in some studies,  xxxg849xxx  immunoreactive neurons are
significantly decreased in the hippocampus and median septum
of aged brain (flood et al., 1998; shi et al., 2004; stanley and
shetty, 2004).
in a previous our and other studies, gaba receptor subunits
and transporters have expressed in human or mice ca
pyramidal neurons at higher levels than in ca1 pyramidal
neurons by immunohistochemistry (mizukami et al., 1998;
hwang et al., 2004b) and consistent with single-cell gene
expression observations (ginsberg and che, 2005). in addition,
significant decline of inhibitory neurons in the hippocampal
ca1 region between middle and old age rat may be correlated
with compromised inhibitory control over pyramidal neurons
as well as impaired communication among the remaining
gabaergic cells (shi et al., 2004). these results suggest that
the hippocampal ca1 region are more vulnerable to various
environmental changes compared to the ca2/3 region.
in present study, plk and  xxxg1793xxx  immunoreactivities, their
protein contents and total activities were lowest at pm 24.
these results indicate that at age brain the gabaergic
inhibition of ca1 glutamatergic pyramidal cells may be lower
than at adult brain.
it has been reported that the injection of bicuculline (a
gabaa antagonist) produces multiple population spikes in
slices from young and aged groups; however, this increase in
population spike burst duration was much greater in slices from
young rats than in slices from aged rats (post-munson et al.,
1994). moreover, agonist radiolabeled gabaa binding site
density was found to be significantly reduced in the
hippocampal tissue of aged rats. this result supports our
finding of a significant reduction in gabaergic inhibition in
the hippocampus of aged animals. in a previous study, we also
observed that gaba degradation enzyme ( xxxg8xxx ) immunoreactivity and protein content were increased
significantly in the hippocampus at pm 24 (hwang et al.,
2004a). this result suggests that the gaba level may reduce
significantly in the hippocampus at pm 24.
in conclusion, we suggest that reduced levels of plk and
 xxxg1793xxx  in the hippocampal ca1 region of aged brain may be
involved in some aging processes related with gaba
function.
