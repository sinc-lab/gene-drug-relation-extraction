abstract
we used the reversibly binding d2 dopamine receptor radioligand
[123111bzm(iodobenzamide)to test whether the endogenous neurotransmitter dopamine
competes in vivo for radiotracer binding measured with single photon emission computed
tomography (spect). in a series of nonhuman primate experiments (n = 271, the effects
of temperature, amphetamine, haloperidol, and reserpine on brain uptake of [1231]ibzm
were measured. specific brain uptake of [123111bzmreached a peak by 100 min postinjection of radioligand and demonstrated a gradual, apparent “steady-state”washout over the
next 2 hr. brain uptake was temperature dependent, with rates of washout of specifically
bound radioligand greater under normothermic conditions (26%/hr: core body temperature 35-37°c) than under conditions of controlled hypothermia (1l%/hr; 3234°c). given
the greater retention of radioactivity, low-temperature conditions were used in all other
experiments. administration of haloperidol (0.02 mgfkg iv) during the period of apparent
steady state resulted in a dramatic increase in washout (60%/hr;p < o.oool), consistent
with its potent  xxxg656xxx  antagonist properties. d-amphetamine (1.0 mgkg iv), which
has negligible affinity for the  xxxg656xxx  but mediates the release of endogenous stores of
dopamine, also enhanced washout (34%/hr;p < 0.0005).reserpine pretreatment at doses
(1.0 mgkg) sufficient to cause greater than 90% depletion of striatal dopamine levels
blocked this amphetamine-enhanced washout (10%/hr;p < 0.05). reserpine did not block
the increased washout induced by the direct-acting  xxxg656xxx  antagonist haloperidol.
these results are consistent with the hypothesis that endogenous dopamine may effectively compete for radioligand binding in vivo in neuroreceptor imaging studies using pet
and spect.
introduction
with the advent of radionuclide imaging techniques
such as pet (positron emission tomography) and
spect (single photon emission computed tomography),
opportunities now exist for the noninvasive study of in
vivo brain chemistry. initial approaches using these
methodologies have focused on general measures of
cerebral blood flow, oxygen consumption, or glucose
metabolism (phelps et al., 1982). the recent development of receptor-specific radioligands, however, offers
the potential for functionally assessing individual neurotransmitter systems in human and nonhuman primates.

dopamine systems. for example, investigators have

dopamine receptor densities in the postmortem brains

displacement studies

detailed kinetic analyses of the effects of haloperidol,
d-amphetamine, and reserpine administration on the
washout of specifically bound radioligand were performed. in a series of control studies, baboons were
maintained at approximately 32-34°c (n = 10) or 3537°c (n = 31, and the brain uptake of [1231]ibzmwas
monitored for an average of 4 hr (range 2.5-6 hr). all
other experiments were performed at the lower temperature range. displacement studies using intravenous
haloperidol (0.02 mg/kg), a specific  xxxg656xxx  antagonist, were performed in two baboons. d-amphetamine
experiments (n = 10)were carried out at doses ranging
from 0.5 to 2.0 mgkg (average 1.0 mgkg). in two of
these experiments, animals received reserpine (1.0
mgkg iv) 4 hr prior to amphetamine infusion, a time
period that, based on studies in the rat, is sufficient to
allow greater than 90% depletion of tissue dopamine
content (spector et al., 1961). following completion of
the imaging studies in the reserpine-treated baboons, a
euthanizing dose of iv pentobarbital was given. the
brain was removed and sectioned in planes parallel to
the cm line, as previously described (elsworth et al.,
19871, and punch biopsies of striatal and cortical regions
were taken from the brain slice, roughly corresponding
to the plane of imaging. brain tissue was then assayed
for levels of endogenous dopamine content according to
the methods of elsworth et al. (1989).
statistical analyses
analyses of the rate of washout of brain uptake were
carried out when specific radioactivity reached a plateau or period of apparent steady state. beginning at
this point in controls, or at the time of injection in
d-amphetamine- or haloperidol-treated animals, data
points collected over the ensuing 60 min were fit t o a
linear curve using a graphics program (kaleidagraph'"
v2.0: synergy software, redding, pa), and the percentage change per hour was calculated. statistical calculations were made using an unpaired group (two-tailed)
t test.

constant rate of "washout" over a period of approximately 120 min. this period of apparent steady state
(i.e., 1.5-3.5 hr post-injection of [1231]ibzm)was targeted in subsequent studies to determine the effects of
intravenously administered agents on specifically
bound radioligand.
temperature effect
during the course of these studies with [123111bzm,
we serendipitously discovered that the clearance of
brain radioactivity was temperature dependent. this
finding emerged due to the tendency of barbiturate
anesthesia to lower body temperature. although not
differing significantly in the time to reach plateau, we
found that animals with hypothermic core temperatures (measured with a deep rectal probe) of 32-34°c
(n = 6) showed a more gradual washout of specific brain
radioactivity (11.2 2 4.9%/hr) than animals maintained in the 35-37°c range (n = 3; 26.3 2 o.g%/'hr).
this temperature effect approached significance a t the
p < 0.075 level. subsequent to this discovery (about
midway in the studies), experiments were performed at
controlled and monitored hypothermic core temperatures (32-34°c). when animal studies with monitored
temperatures shown to be hypothermic (n = 6 ) were
compared with previously unmonitored experiments
retrospectively thought to have been hypothermic as a
result of pentobarbital anesthesia (n = 41, no statistical
difference between groups was found. groups were
therefore combined and constitute the series of experiments hereafter referred to as controls (n = 10;
10.8 2.8%/hr).

in two experiments, intravenous haloperidol (0.02
m&g) was administered during the period of apparent
steady state (given 100 1 min after injection of
[123111bzm) (figs. 2 and 4). haloperidol produced a
greater than fivefold increase in the rate of washout

this increased washout appeared to represent displacement of the radioligand by the potent d2-receptor antagonist haloperidol. haloperidol was also given at the
end of other displacement studies to confirm the reversibility of 1123111bzmbinding. although not formally
analyzed, a similarly dramatic decrease in specific radioactivity was produced.
effect of amphetamine on washout
in a series of 10 spect scanning experiments, administration of d-amphetamine alone at an average
dose of 1.0 mgkg (range 0.5-2.0 mgkg iv; time of
injection 99 2 6 min) produced a 33.8 2 4.6%/hr decrease (range 14.6-53.6%/hr) in specific radioligand
binding (fig. 5). as with control studies, no significant
difference between monitored, known hypothermic
(n = 4) and unmonitored, presumed to be hypothermic
(n = 6 ) experiments was found, and the groups were
pooled. the rate of clearance of brain radioactivity in the
d-amphetamine group was significantly enhanced relative to controls (p < 0.0005).

ously described (lidowet al., 1989).the ics0(or concentration required t o displace 50% of specifically bound
[3h]raclopride)of d-amphetamine was greater than 10
mm. thus, it is unlikely that d-amphetamine itself
caused displacement of [1231]ibzmfrom the  xxxg656xxx . however, d-amphetamine is known to increase
extracellular levels of dopamine through the blockade of
cellular reuptake and through the release of intracellular (extravesicular) dopamine stores (mcmillen, 1983).
thus, the enhanced washout may have been produced
indirectly by amphetamine-stimulated release of endogenous dopamine. this idea is supported by the recently
published observation (dewey et al., 1991) that amphetamine pretreatment blocks brain uptake of the
high-affinity d2 agent, [18f]-n-methylspiroperidol,as
measured by pet.
recent in vivo studies in rodents have suggested that
endogenous levels of neurotransmitter (i.e., dopamine)
may effectively compete for  xxxg656xxx  radioligand

binding (seeman et al., 1989; ross and jackson, 1989).
using the nonselective dopamine receptor agonist n-npropylnorapomorphine, ross and jackson (1989) found
a decrease in apparent affinity (&) without a change in
receptor density (b,,,) following d-amphetamine administration. the actions of amphetamine were blocked
by pretreatment of animals with reserpine. these results are consistent with competitive inhibition by amphetamine-stimulated dopamine release.
to test the hypothesis that the enhanced washout of
brain uptake is mediated indirectly by amphetamine's
ability to increase extracellular dopamine, we examined
the effect of reserpine pretreatment on radioligand
displacement. pretreatment with reserpine resulted in
a marked attenuation of amphetamine-accelerated
washout of specific radioligand binding (decreased from
34 to 10%/hr).subsequent administration of the directacting antagonist, haloperidol, produced its characteristically rapid and robust displacement of radioligand.
although these results support the notion that endogenous dopamine competes for ['23111bzm binding, the
ability of reserpine pretreatment to block the effect of
d-amphetamine might not have been expected, given
existing data from other studies. in rodents, reserpine
blocks neither the locomotor effects of d-amphetamine
nor the release of striatal dopamine as measured by
microdialysis techniques (callaway et al., 1989).such a
finding in nonhuman primates may represent a species
difference. preliminary microdialysis studies in rhesus

dopamine competes for [lz3i1ibzmbinding

monkeys have shown a 50- to 100-fold increase in
extracellular dopamine in the caudate following amphetamine treatment (moghaddam et al., 1990). comparable experiments in rodents have resulted in only a
3- to 8-fold increase in extracellular dopamine (bradberry and roth, 1989). thus, although the literature
from rodent studies has generally pointed to extravesicular, reserpine-insensitive dopamine stores as a site of
amphetamine's pharmacologic action, our findings in
nonhuman primates suggest a possible dependence on
reserpine-sensitive pools. in contrast to studies of striatal dopamine release, a putative effect on reserpinesensitive stores is supported by recent studies of nucleus accumbens-dependent behaviors in the rat, where
reserpine, but not alpha-methylparatyrosine, successfully blocked amphetamine-conditioned reward (hiroi
and white, 1990). further spect studies, combined
with microdialysis using dopamine synthesis inhibitors
(alpha-methylparatyrosine),selective uptake blockers
(amfonelic acid), and impulse blocking agents (gammabutyrolactone), may help clarify such potential differences in nonhuman primates.
our finding of increased brain retention of specifically bound radioligand under hypothermic conditions
is noteworthy. although the exact mechanism responsible for this effect is unknown, metabolic factors may
play a role. the metabolic fate of [123111bzmin vivo
remains to be fully characterized in primates. recent
studies in humans demonstrate that by 2 hr postinjection the majority of organically extractable radioactivity
is in the form of a single metabolite (kung et al., 1990).
given the significant degree of metabolism seen in
humans at normal body temperature, hypothermic retention of radioactivity may result from decreased hepatic metabolism and clearance. alternatively, given
the well-known effects of lowered body temperature on
brain metabolism, a central mechanism may be primarily responsible. for example, a decrease in brain metabolism might result in reduced central dopamine turnover. in light of our findings above, such an effect might
be expected to reduce the brain washout of radioactivity.
in either instance, this effect may be useful in kinetic
analyses where stable, steady-state conditions are optimal. it is important to note, however, that the amphetamine-stimulated washout of brain radioactivity was
not due to a potential rise in body temperature. animals
were continuously monitored with a deep rectal thermal
probe and were found to maintain hypothermic core
temperatures.
as noted above, definitive metabolic studies of
[1231]ibzmin primates have yet to be done. as a result,
though consistent with the  xxxg656xxx  binding properties of [123111bzm, brain radioactivity has not been
shown in these experiments to represent the parent
compound. therefore, brain uptake in our studies is
referred to simply as radioactivity.however, reextraction studies of [1231]ibzmin rodents support the idea

183

that only the parent compound enters the brain (kung
et al., 1989) and that prepared authentic metabolites,
which are more polar, do not cross the blood-brain
barrier (kung, personal communication). furthermore,
the ability of the highly selective d2 dopamine receptor
antagonist haloperidol to rapidly and dramatically displace this radioactivity suggests its association with the
 xxxg656xxx .
our findings that endogenous dopamine may effectively compete for [1231]ibzmbinding to the d2 dopamine receptor represents an important variable to be
considered in the interpretation of in vivo neuroreceptor
imaging studies in general. for example, apparent receptor density may be underestimated in conditions
such as schizophrenia, where high rates of dopamine
turnover may exist (seeman et al., 1989). use of techniques such as reserpine pretreatment (or perhaps even
inducement of hypothermic conditions) may reduce the
effect of endogenous dopamine on measurements of
receptor number or affinity. conversely, given known
receptor densities and affinities, in vivo imaging of
neuroreceptors might ultimately be useful in estimating
synaptic levels of endogenous neurotransmitter (ross,
1991). such a technique might thus provide a direct
measure of neuronal activity in vivo for a given transmitter system.
in summary, we confirm the utility of ['231]ibzm as a
probe for labeling brain d2 dopamine receptors in nonhuman primates using spect. moreover, our findings
demonstrate its potential usefulness in more detailed
kinetic studies of the dopamine system. although absolute quantitative measures of receptor affinity (iq and
number (bmm)are not currently possible with spect,
relative measures of regional radioactive density enable
the assessment of changes in specific radioligand binding. under apparent steady-state conditions, both haloperidol and amphetamine resulted in a significantly
increased washout of specifically bound radioactivity.
pretreatment of animals with reserpine appeared to
reverse the effect of the amphetamine alone, suggesting
that dopamine itself competes for [1231]ibzmbinding to
the  xxxg656xxx .
