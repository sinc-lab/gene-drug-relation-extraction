abstract. when freshly drawn, heparinized human whole

blood is incubated with 501am calcium ionophore
a23187, platelets are stimulated to produce thromboxane
b2 (txb2) by activation of prostaglandin g/h synthase-1
( xxxg1883xxx ). txb2 concentration, as measured by immunoassay, is maximal at 20-30rain and declines thereafter.
addition of  xxxd234xxx  (ics0 = 2.8 [tm) or other
nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (nsaids) 15rain
or 4.5 h prior to 30 rain stimulation with ionophore results
in concentration dependent inhibition of txb2 production. when blood is incubated with 0.01-10 ~tg/ml e. coli
lipopolysaccharide (lps),  xxxg1884xxx  is induced and txb2
levels become detectable at 3 h and continue to increase
through 24h. using a 5 h incubation with 10 gg/ml lps,
aspirin (10 gm added at 0 h), which is rapidly metabolized
to  xxxd3159xxx , had no effect on 10 gg/ml lps-induced
txb2, but inhibited txb2 production by ionophore
a23187 added at 4.5h, through acetylation of preexisting  xxxg1883xxx . in a 5h assay, nsaids added at oh
were compared for inhibition of txb2 production
stimulated by addition of ionophore a23187 at 4.5h
( xxxg1883xxx ), or by addition of lps at 0 h ( xxxg1884xxx ). most
nsaids were more potent against  xxxg1883xxx  than pghs2. diclofenac, naproxen and  xxxd2122xxx  were
equipotent or slightly selective for  xxxg1884xxx .  xxxd1882xxx 
and  xxxd2727xxx  were >4-fold selective for  xxxg1884xxx , and

introduction

following the recognition that prostaglandin g/h
synthase exists in two forms (one constitutive,  xxxg1883xxx ;
and the other inducible in response to inflammatory
stimuli,  xxxg1884xxx ) [1-9], and the proposal that the
undesirable effects of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory
drugs (nsaids) were due to inhibition of  xxxg1883xxx ,
whereas the desirable effects were due to inhibition of
 xxxg1884xxx  [10, 11], considerable effort has been devoted to
identifying compounds which selectively inhibit  xxxg1884xxx 
[10-18]. assay systems to investigate the potency and
selectivity of existing and novel nsaids have included,
for example: microsomal preparations of recombinantly
expressed murine enzymes [10]; intact cells, broken cells
and purified enzymes from various animal sources [11];
purified human recombinant enzymes [13-15]; and
isolated human whole cells [16]. it has become apparent
from these studies that there are sufficient differences
between the enzymes from different species, such that
selectivity and potency established with animal enzymes is
not always predictive of effects on the human enzymes.
further, it is our experience that interpretation of results
is complicated by the wide variety of mechanisms of
enzyme inhibition encountered: eg., competitive, noncompetitive, uncompetitive, time-dependent and pseudoirreversible [14, 19, 20], and individual compounds may
display different mechanisms of inhibition against  xxxg1883xxx  and  xxxg1884xxx . in order to address these issues, at least in
part, we wished to design a human in vitro system, as
close to physiological as possible, in which new compounds could be rapidly screened for potency and
selectivity against the two human enzymes.
it has been reported that freshly drawn whole blood
incubated in vitro with the calcium ionophore a23187,
undergoes platelet activation with the rapid release of
thromboxane a2 (txa2), which is determined as thromboxane b2 [21]. inclusion of nsaids in the incubation
mixture prevents the formation of prostaglandin h2,
which is the precursor of txb2. therefore, inhibition of
txb2 production can be taken as a surrogate measure of

materials and methods
human blood (~45 ml), from fasted male and female donors who
had received no medication for at least 10 days, was collected
between 7:30 a.m. and 9:00 a.m. into siliconized vacutainers containing heparin (19 units per ml final concentration) and used within
1 h of collection. calcium ionophore a23187 free acid was obtained
from sigma chemical co., st. louis, mo, usa (catalogue no. c
7522) or from calbiochem, san diego, ca, usa (catalogue no.
100105) and was prepared as a 25mm stock solution in
dimethylsulfoxide (dmso), and stored at -20~
lipopolysaccharide (from escherichia coli serotype 026:b6) was obtained
from sigma chemical co., st. louis, mo, usa (catalogue no. l
3755) and prepared as a 5 mg/ml stock solution in dmso stored at
4 ~ the thromboxane b2 radioimmunoassay kit was obtained
500

247
from nen research products, boston, ma, usa (cat. no. nek
007) and the thromboxane b2 enzyme immunoassay kit was
obtained from perseptive diagnostics, inc., cambridge, ma, usa
(cat. no. 8-6802). dexamethasone and the nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs were obtained from sigma chemical co., st.
louis, mo, usa, or were synthesized at syntex research, palo
alto, ca, usa. these test compounds were prepared as stock
solutions in dmso, and appropriate dilutions were made in
dmso. preliminary experiments (not shown) indicated that
incorporation of dmso between 2 and 10 gl per ml human blood
had no effect on basal or a23187 stimulated txb2 release.
accordingly, dmso was used as the vehicle for all additions,
including a23187, lps and test materials. other solvents were not
investigated.
reactions were carried out using 1 ml aliquots of human whole
blood in loosely capped 12 â€¢ 75 mm glass tubes incubated at 37 ~
in a water bath under ambient atmosphere. at the times indicated in
the results section, test materials, calcium ionophore a23187 and/
or lipopolysaccharide were added as 2 gl aliquots each in dmso
solution. the reactions were terminated by quickly chilling the tubes
in an ice bath, centrifuging the tubes to separate the plasma, and
storing the separated plasma and duplicate 2gl aliquots in
polypropylene tubes at -20 ~ for the determination of thromboxane b2 levels, the plasma samples were diluted in buffer and
aliquots were analyzed by either radioimmunoassay or by enzyme
immunoassay according to instructions provided with the respective
kits.
for each test material, the results were expressed as percent
inhibition of txb2 production relative to control incubations
containing dmso vehicle. the data were analyzed with a nonlinear
estimation program using the nelder mead algorithm to estimate
parameters (pcnonlin from sci software). initial analyses of
the data for nine nsaids in each of six donors using a 4 parameter
model (% maximum inhibition, % minimum inhibition, slope and
ics0) indicated that the data were best analyzed in a one parameter
model of the form:
f(x) = 100/(1 + ic50/x)
with the assumption that the response ranged between 0% and
100% and that the slope of the curve was 1.0.
for the analyses of acetylsalicylicacid and  xxxd3159xxx , human
whole blood, to which 10 gg/ml  xxxd234xxx  was added at
time 0, was maintained at 37 ~ and aliquots were removed at the
indicated times. aliquots were spiked with an internal standard,
diluted with water, acidified and extracted twice with  xxxd2052xxx .
the  xxxd2052xxx  extracts were evaporated under nitrogen and
reconstituted in hplc mobile phase (22 % acetonitrile, 78 % 0.1%
aqueous trifluoroacetic acid). hplc quantitation was carried out
with an lc-235 photodiode array set at 230 nm. peak height was
used for quantitation and the lower detectable limit was 30 ng/ml.

inhibition of txb2 production (measured after an
additional 30min of incubation) occurs. with the exception of aspirin (see below), similar ics0s were obtained
when the drugs were added 4.5 h prior to activation with
a23187 for 30rain (table 1). over the course of
numerous assays, typical amounts of txb2 in control
incubations were in the range of 200-400 ng/ml. some
donors, each on at least two occasions, yielded control
values lower than 100 ng/ml or as much as 800 ng/ml, and
these individuals were not used on a regular basis.
addition of 10 ~tg/ml final concentration e. coli lipopolysaccharide to blood samples resulted in a slow and
moderate increase in txb2 levels through 24 h (fig. 4).
further studies were carried out using a 5 h incubation
time, which appeared to give reasonably consistent levels

of txb2 well elevated above background. addition of
1 gm dexamethasone to blood samples 15 min prior to the
addition of lps resulted in 65% inhibition of txb2
production, and indomethacin at 10gg/ml completely
blocked txb2 production (data not shown). using blood
from five donors, an attempt was made to analyse the
concentration-dependence of lps-induced txb2 production over the concentration range 0.001-101,tg/ml. as
shown in figure 5, there was considerable individual
variation in sensitivity to lps, resulting in an apparently
quite shallow concentration-response curve. this was not
investigated further, and 10 gg/ml lps was selected as the
concentration to be used in subsequent assays.
when aspirin (or  xxxd3159xxx ) was added  xxxd1891xxx  gg/ml
to blood stimulated with lps for 5h, there was no
inhibition of txb2 production (fig. 6). this is in contrast
to the >95% inhibition of txb2 production obtained
when a23187 was used as the sole stimulus (fig. 2). as
shown in figure 6, lps added at 0 h and a23187 added at
4 h were additive with respect to the amounts of txb2
produced, and inclusion of 10 gg/ml aspirin at 0 h reduced
the level of txb2 to that obtained with lps alone.
 xxxd3159xxx , the de-acetylation product of aspirin, was
without effect when included  xxxd1891xxx  gg/ml.
as shown in figure 7, aspirin is rapidly de-acetylated in
whole blood (half-life approximately 30 min, and less than
10% of the original amount remains after 3 h incubation,
or when a23187 was added at 4 h as in figure 6 or at 4.5 h
as in the standard assay (for example table 1).
on the basis of these preliminary experiments, a
standard assay methodology was adopted in which the
test materials were added at various concentrations at 0 h
to 1 ml samples of freshly isolated, heparinized whole
blood. to one set of incubates, lps (10 gg/ml) was also
added at oh; to the second set of incubates a23187
(50 gm final concentration) was added at 4,5 h; and all
incubations were terminated at 5 h. the results shown in
table 1 represent the pooled values for a minimum of 4
concentrations of test material using blood from three or
more donors. as indicated previously, 101xm aspirin,
added at - 1 5 min or at 0 h, was an effective inhibitor of
txb2 production induced by addition of a23187 at either
0 h or 4.5 h, respectively. aspirin at 167 gm (added at 0 h)
had no effect on lps-induced txb2 production. a series
of assays were carried out (data not shown) in which
aspirin up to 167 gm was added at 1, 2, 3, and 4 h o f a 5h
incubation with lps. although some inhibitory activity
was observed (up to 33%), the results were variable and a
calculation of an ics0 could not be made. this was
assumed to be a consequence of the short, approximately
30 rain, half-life of  xxxd234xxx  (fig. 7) coupled
with the continuous synthesis of new  xxxg1884xxx  beyond 2 h
(fig. 4). compounds of the  xxxd189xxx  series (with,
perhaps, the exception of  xxxd2723xxx ) behaved anomalously with respect to inhibition of lps-stimulated
 xxxg1884xxx : the concentration-inhibition curves were quite
flat; statistical analysis did not support the assumption
that the slope of the curve, n, was equal to 1; and 95%
confidence limits were either very broad or could not be
calculated.
for a selected subset of compounds, the values using
human whole blood are compared with the values

conclusions
soon after we began our search for selective inhibitors of
 xxxg1884xxx , it became clear that our own results with
recombinant h u m a n cell-free enzymes or isolated human
cells or cell lines (unpublished data), and reported results
with isolated h u m a n cells or cell lines, and cells, cell lines
or enzymes from other species, were difficult to reconcile
with in vivo results. factors which complicated the
interpretation of the results included: 1) variation in
sequence homology of the two enzymes ( xxxg1883xxx  and -2)
amongst species, such that selectivity with respect to rat
enzymes did not translate in every case into selectivity for
the human enzymes; 2) variations in mechanism of
inhibition (competitive, non-competitive, uncompetitive,
time-dependent, irreversible, etc.) were not necessarily the
same for the two enzymes or across species; and 3) factors
such as protein binding, cell-cell interaction, and
substrate availability were not adequately or consistently
addressed. with this background we began our attempt
to develop a system which would permit moderate-tohigh throughput screening of compounds for selectivity
against human  xxxg1883xxx  and  xxxg1884xxx  under as near to
in vivo physiological conditions as possible. h u m a n
whole blood appeared to represent a consistently obtainable source of species relevant cells which could be
maintained (at least for short periods of time) under para
vivo conditions and which: t) was composed of cells
which only possess  xxxg1883xxx  and cannot be induced to
express  xxxg1884xxx  (platelets); as well as 2) cells involved in
the inflammatory process which express very low levels of
 xxxg1883xxx  but can be induced to express  xxxg1884xxx  (monocytes and, perhaps, other leukocytes); and 3) accounted
for differences in plasma protein binding and cellular
accumulation; as well as 4) could reconcile differences in
mechanism of inhibitory action under near physiological
conditions.
as shown previously by sweeney et al. [21] cyclooxygenase product formation in response to 50 pm a23187
stimulation of h u m a n whole blood occurs rapidly and is
essentially complete within 20-30 rain (fig. 1). the peak
may occur earlier than shown, since the metabolic
product is thromboxane a2 which must undergo conversion to thromboxane b2 which is the actual substance
recognized by the r i a or eia. beyond 30rain the
detectable levels of txb2 decline presumably because of
further metabolic degradation to materials which are not
recognized by the immunoassay antibodies. although
basal levels of txb2 are detectable in unstimulated blood
treated with up to 10 gl/ml d m s o , no effort was made to
further characterize these levels which were less than 5%
of the ionophore stimulated levels out to 3 h (fig. 1), and
less than 5% of the lps stimulated levels in the 5 h assay

fig. 6. thromboxane b 2 production in human whole blood from
three donors incubated for 5 h. e. coli lipopolysaccharide (10 gg/
ml), acetylsalicylicacid (aspirin, 10 gg/ml) and  xxxd3159xxx  (10 p,g/
ml) were added at 0 h where indicated. calcium ionophore a23187
(50gm) was added at 4h where indicated. bars represent the
average of replicate determinations for each donor.
a23187 was found to produce a consistently maximal
response for different subjects with minimal hemolysis
(data not shown), although it should be noted that lower
levels may be required in rat blood in order to avoid very
significant hemolysis.
 xxxd234xxx  (aspirin) is an effective inhibitor of
a23187-induced txb~ production when added to samples
15min prior to stimulation with ionophore, and the
concentration dependence of inhibition is quite consistent
between different donors (fig. 2). a similar consistency
between donors was observed for indomethacin inhibition (fig. 3). analysis of the data using a p c n o n l i n
program showed that the curves were typically sigmoidal
with a slope equal to 1, consistent with a direct inhibitory
effect on an enzymatic process.
under the conditions of ionophore stimulation and
the resultant time-course of txb2 production (5-30 min),
prostanoid formation appears to be a consequence of

inflammres

activation of pre-existing enzyme (constitutive  xxxg1883xxx )
primarily in platelets [12, 16], although other sources of
constitutive enzyme cannot be excluded. the approximately linear decrease in txb2 concentration from 30300 min (fig. 1) is not consistent with the induction of
additional enzyme or enzymatic activity.
several groups had demonstrated that monocytes
from various species could be induced to produce
prostanoid metabolites by treatment with lipopolysaccharide (lps) either in isolated monocytes or in whole
blood [1, 9, 11, 16, 23, 24]. initial experiments involving
treatment of human whole blood with 10 gg/ml e. coli
lipopolysaccharide (fig. 4) showed that txb2 levels were
within 0-15 ng/ml during the first 2 h (consistent with
dmso control levels, see fig. 1), but were significantly
increased at 3 h and continued to increase through 24 h
(the last time point examined). this time-course was
consistent with the induction of new enzyme (inducible
 xxxg1884xxx ) as shown by fu et al. [1] for isolated monocytes
and by patrignani et al. [24] for human whole blood; and
our own results (data not shown). using an incubation
time of 5 h, which was judged to be most convenient for
an assay run on a daily basis, the dependence of txb2
production on lps concentration was examined. as
shown in fig. 5, there was a relatively flat concentrationresponse curve averaged over five donors, with onset
occurring between 0.001 and 0.01 gg/ml, an apparent
plateau occurring between 0.1 and 1 gg/ml, and higher
levels of txb2 production occurring with 10 gg/ml lps.
higher concentrations of lps were not investigated, and
a similarly flat concentration dependence curve has been
observed by others [1, 24].
the experiment shown in figure 6 suggests that
calcium ionophore a23187 and lps activate different
and independent pools of enzyme.  xxxd234xxx 
addition at 0 h irreversibly inactivates the constitutive
 xxxg1883xxx  pool such that a23187 has no stimulatory effect
when added at either 0 h or 4 h of a 5 h incubation. since
 xxxd234xxx  is rapidly degraded (fig. 7), it has no
effect when added at oh on  xxxg1884xxx  subsequently
induced by lps. as shown in fig. 6, aspirin addition at
oh had no affect on lps induced txb2 levels at 5h.
dexamethasone at 1 lam inhibited lps stimulated txb2
production by 65%, which is consistent with the results of
fu et al. [1] who showed that 2 g m dexamethasone
blocked lps induced release of txb2 by 80% from
monocytes incubated for 24 h. similarly, patrignani et al.
[24] reported 89% and 96% inhibition of lps stimulated
pge2 production at 4 and 24 h, respectively, using 2 gm
dexamethasone.
during the course of this work, patrignani et al. [24]
described a whole blood system for determining  xxxg1883xxx 
and  xxxg1884xxx  activity, based on txb2 production by
unheparinized, spontaneously clotting blood (1 h), and
pge2 production in heparinized, aspirin pre-treated, lps
stimulated blood (24 h incubation). aspirin was included
to suppress a possible contribution of  xxxg1883xxx  to pge2
production in the 24h assay, but, in fact, its inclusion
appears to have no significant effect [24]. although pge2
was considered to be a more appropriate readout for
 xxxg1884xxx  activity by patrignani et al. [24], we elected to use
txb2 as the endpoint because of the wider dynamic range

afforded which allowed incubation times of 5 h rather
than 24h. in any event, txb2 is the major prostanoid
produced by lps stimulated monocytes (8-10 fold
greater than pge2 [1, 22]. the data summarized in
figure 6 are consistent with a non-significant contribution o f  xxxg1883xxx  to lps stimulated txb2 formation.
the activities of a range of n s a i d s representing
different structural categories are given in table 1.
 xxxd234xxx  was reasonably potent against
 xxxg1883xxx , but showed inconsistent activity against
 xxxg1884xxx  under a variety of assay conditions. when
added at 0 h it is rapidly degraded to  xxxd3159xxx  as
shown in figure 7, such that very little remains at the time
of appearance of lps-induced txb2. in experiments not
shown,  xxxd234xxx  was added at 1, 2, 3, and 4 h of
lps incubation at concentrations up to 167gm, and
although some degree of inhibition was obtained, in no
case did it reach 50%. these results are similar to those
reported by glaser et al. [17, 18].  xxxd234xxx  is
capable of acetylating p g h s - 2 [8] and inhibiting phgs-2
activity in whole cells, broken cells and purified enzyme

[11], but the ics0 in whole ceils is 50 i 10 ~tg/ml [11],
which is far above the m a x i m u m plasma level achieved in
man. although it was quite weak against both enzymes,
 xxxd1882xxx  showed a >4-fold selectivity for  xxxg1884xxx .
in the  xxxd3029xxx  series, all compounds but
naproxen were selective for  xxxg1883xxx . glaser et al. [18],
found a similar degree of  xxxg1884xxx  selectivity for
naproxen, but in addition reported that  xxxd2141xxx 
was balanced with respect to the two enzymes.
in the acetic acid series, compounds were strongly
selective for  xxxg1883xxx  ( xxxd3563xxx  and indomethacin), or
weakly  xxxg1884xxx  selective (dmofenac). again, the results
with indomethacin and diclofenac are similar to those
reported [18].
during our survey of different classes of nsaids,
barnett et al. [14] found that some members of the
anthranific acid series demonstrated substantial  xxxg1884xxx 
selectivity using the human recombinant cell-free enzyme
system (table 2). grossman et al [16] also reported pghs2 selectivity for a series of anthranilic acids using isolated
platelets and lps-stimulated monocytes with exogenous
 xxxd208xxx . barnett et al. [14] showed that niflumic
acid time-dependently inhibited both  xxxg1883xxx  and pghs2, but that inhibition of  xxxg1883xxx  was much slower in onset
than inhibition of  xxxg1884xxx ; in contrast,  xxxd2141xxx  and
indomethacin acted more rapidly against  xxxg1883xxx  than
against  xxxg1884xxx . their results, shown in table 2, are based
on a 10 rain pre-incubation with inhibitor followed by a 45 s
incubation with substrate. these conditions approximate
initial enzyme velocities, and minimize inhibitory potency
of compounds with a time-dependent (slow onset) action.
this and strong protein binding might account, at least
with respect to  xxxd2723xxx , for the dramatic change in
selectivity of the  xxxd189xxx  series between the cell-free
enzyme results and the human whole blood results (table
2). while several of these compounds appear to be nearly
balanced in human whole blood, the data do not support
significant selectivity for  xxxg1884xxx , nor are these compounds recognized as possessing a distinct therapeutic
advantage in the clinic.

selectivity for  xxxg1884xxx . ns-398, which was reported to
show  xxxg1884xxx  selectivity in animal microsome preparations and to show an improved therapeutic advantage in
rat models [25], was the most selective agent for  xxxg1884xxx 
inhibition in the whole blood system.
when the results obtained with the whole blood assay
are compared with those from purified enzymes [14] as
shown in table 2, it is clear that there are major
discrepancies with respect to: 1) absolute inhibitor potency
against cell-free and whole cell enzyme; 2) calculated
selectivity ratios; and 3) rank ordering of selectivity.
there is no apparent algorithm relating cell-free results to
whole blood assay results. while the protocols described
attempt to minimize bias with respect to protein binding,
in vitro metabolism, and endogenous substrate pools, by
relying on single blood samples from donors, selectivity
ratios must be considered as relative between compounds,
rather than absolute measures for a particular compound.
the txb2 levels in response to 5 h stimulation with lps
are at least 3 fold lower than those in response to 30 min
stimulation with a23187, which might be considered to
bias the results in favor of p g h s - 2 inhibition. however,
with the longer incubation times with lps, txb2 levels as
measured by r i a or eia continue to rise (fig. 4, and [cf.
1, 24]), and  xxxg1884xxx  enzyme continues to increase [1, 24],
while unassayed (undetectable) txb2 degradation products must also increase (fig. 1). since p g h s undergoes
oxidative destruction with substrate turnover [19; and
references therein], inhibitory ics0s in either assay are
dependent on substrate availability, the reversible or
irreversible nature of the inhibitor, and the length of the
incubation with either inducer. the measure of  xxxg1883xxx 
activity is based on enzyme existent at the time of blood
draw. in vivo, p g h s - 1 may be continually synthesized in,
for example, gastrointestinal tissues and kidney. these
considerations lead us to believe that the selectivity ratios
shown in table 1 may be biased in favor of  xxxg1883xxx . for
example, indomethacin,  xxxd2141xxx  and  xxxd2423xxx 
(with ratios <0.1 in whole blood) have well-recognized
anti-inflammatory activity at relatively non-toxic levels,
which would not be predictable from the ratios listed in
table 2. in addition, diclofenac, naproxen and  xxxd2727xxx 
(with ratios >1.0 in whole blood) do not show a
particularly greater margin of clinical safety than other
n s a i d s listed. we conclude that much larger separations of activity against  xxxg1883xxx  and  xxxg1884xxx  will be
required of a new generation of n s a i d s showing
substantially improved safety characteristics. it remains
to be seen if the high ratio displayed by ns-398 (a
structural analog of  xxxd2727xxx ), which displays
improved gastro-intestinal safety in the rat [25], translates
into improved safety in man.
