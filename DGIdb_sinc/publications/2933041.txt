abstract-the
effect of four slow ca2+ channel blockers ( xxxd2092xxx , nifedipine,  xxxd3007xxx  and
 xxxd318xxx ) that possess the ability to bind to calmodulin (cam)§ and to inhibit myosin light chain kinase
( xxxg1491xxx ) on cam-regulated ca2+ pumping atpase of cardiac sarcolemma (sl) and brain  xxxd1773xxx 
phosphodiesterase
(pde) was studied. the ability of these drugs to inhibit ca2’ pumping atpase
correlated with their inhibitory effect on cam-activated ca 2f-dependent pde. nifedipine was unable
to inhibit markedly both enzymes.  xxxd3007xxx  also was a weak inhibitor, which was unexpected because
of its cam binding potency.  xxxd2092xxx  (10-50 @i) and  xxxd318xxx  (50 @v4)markedly reduced activities
of sl ca2+ pumping atpase and pde. striking differences were, however, demonstrated when ca2+
and cam concentrations, respectively, were increased. previously it was reported that inhibition of the
sl ca2+ pumping atpase by the cam antagonist calmidazolium could be overcome by increasing ca2+
concentrations (j. m. j. lamers and j. t. stinis, cell calcium 4,281-294,1983).
 xxxd2092xxx  (io-50 fl)
in the present study, appeared to be equipotent with calmidazolium in reducing ca2+ pumping atpase,
but increasing ca2+ up to 12.2 $4 could not counteract this effect.  xxxd2092xxx  (2-10 @i) also inhibited
brain pde noncompetitively with respect to cam contrary to the competitive effecters calmidazolium
and  xxxd318xxx . on the other hand,  xxxd318xxx  (10-20 pm) decreased or increased ca2+ pumping atpase
activity depending on the ca2+ concentration (0.29 and 12.2m, respectively) used. these findings
suggest at least two types of cam antagonists, which can be discriminated on basis of their inhibition
patterns of pde and heart sl ca2+ pumping atpase.

slow ca*+ channel blockers (also termed ca2+ entry
blockers or ca2+ antagonists) represent a broad class
of or anic compounds which inhibit the movement
of ca9 + through ca2+ selective channels [11. several
lines of evidence suggest that these drugs are not only
active at the extracellular side of the sarcolemma, but
also act intracellularly [2-61. it seems reasonable to
expect that interference with ca2+-cam-mediated
processes plays a role in their intracellular actions.
indeed, a number of slow ca2+ channel blockers,
 xxxd2092xxx ,  xxxd2737xxx , nifedipine, verapamil,  xxxd3007xxx  and  xxxd318xxx  are capable of binding and
inhibiting cam [3,5,7-10
these selected drugs,
like the whole group of ca \ + antagonists, are structurally and pharmacologically different which indicates that differences in the mode of action perhaps

not only exist at the slow ca2+ channel, but also at
the intracellular site of action.
ca2+ binding to cam exposes hydrophobic sites
that can bind inhibitory ligands such as calmidazolium,  xxxd3431xxx  and several slow ca2+ channel blockers [ll-131. calmidazolium,
 xxxd2092xxx ,
 xxxd3007xxx  and verapamil bind ca2+ dependently
to cam with kd’s of 2.5 nm, 3, 0.5 and 3opm,
respectively [7]. it is generally believed that the
hydrophobic drug binding site on cam, exposed by
occupation of the ca2+ sites, also represents the
binding site for cam binding proteins and camactivated enzymes [ll-131, such as  xxxg1491xxx  and
camp-pde. it is, however, not a general property
of all cam-activated enzymes as, e.g., the sl ca2+
pumping atpase and phosphorylase b kinase have
cam subunits which remain tightly bound to the
enzyme molecules after isolation of microsomal
respectively supernatant fractions [14-171. hypotonic and subsequent hypertonic treatment in the
presence of a ca ‘+ chelating agent is required to
remove cam from the ca2’ pumping atpase in
cardiac sl vesicles [18]. we reported earlier that
inhibition of sl ca2+ pumping atpase by calmidazolium and  xxxd3431xxx  could be overcome
by increasing ca2+ concentrations
[14,17]. this
finding offered the first indication that the sl ca2+
pumping atpase is regulated by endogenous cam

[14,17-191. it was most convincingly demonstrated
by purification of the cam-depleted sl enzyme on
a cam-affinity chromatography column [18]. at present there are only two studies on the effect of ca2+
antagonists
on the sl ca2+ pumping atpase
[20,21]. the results are, however, conflicting as inhibition [20] as well as activation [21] of the enzyme
has been shown. other studies dealing with sr ca2+
pumping atpase have demonstrated that verapamil,
diltiazem,  xxxd2734xxx  and  xxxd2092xxx  all were stimulatory in a concentration range 20-40 pm [22,23].
slow ca2+ channel blockers of different chemical
structures,
undergoing
complex
chemicalmembrane interactions may prove to be valuable
as probes for studying the molecular mechanism(s)
involved in the regulation of ca2+ pumping atpases.
recent studies with microsomal membranes from
guinea pig intestinal smooth muscle and rabbit ventricle revealed that the high-affinity dihydropyridine
binding sites are proteins with a hydrophobic
domain, very similar to that exposed by complexation of cam with ca2+ [24,25]. it represents,
in fact, the first indication for drug binding to a camlike protein present in its physiological environment.
cam antagonists inhibit high affinity dihydropyridine
binding in the order of potency calmidazolium >
 xxxd3431xxx  > chlorpromazine,
which correlates
quite well with the potency of these drugs to inhibit
cam-dependent processes [24,25]. on the basis of
electrophysiological data johnson [5,26] postulated
that the slow ca2+ channel may contain an intracellularly localized cam-like subunit protein which
functions as the ca2+ receptor for the ca2+-dependent closing gate [26]. in this hypothesis cam and
ca2+ antagonists increase the ca2+ affinity of the
intracellular ca*+-dependent closing gate of the slow
ca2+ channel. thus, in view of the apparent analogy
of cam-like protein representing the intracellular
receptor site for ca2+ of the cardiac sl ca2+ channel
and ca2+ pumping atpase, the protein may also
turn out to be a common target of ca2+ antagonists.
to gain further insight into the anti-cam action
of some slow ca*+ channel blockers, their effects
were studied on the sl ca2+ pumping atpase. as
the latter enzyme represents an example of a membrane-bound enzyme, the same drugs are compared
for their ability to inhibit the soluble brain pde
enzyme.

(sl). sl was
isolated from porcine heart according to the procedure described by reeves and sutko [28], the only
difference being the addition of protease inhibitor
phenylmethylsulfonyl
fluoride to all media in 0.5 mm
concentration. the preparation was highly enriched
in sl as was revealed by the high specific activity of
na+/k+-atpase [29]. cross contamination with sr
membranes was minimal which was verified with
na+- and ca2+-dependent
32p incorporation
into
120 kda proteins separated on sds-polyacrylamide

(sds-page [see refs. 4, 29,

sulfonic acid (mops),
h7.4 at a protein concentration of about 1 mg pml, immediately frozen in
liquid nitrogen and stored at -80”.
assay of sl ca2+ pumping atpase. ca2+/ xxxd2531xxx atpase activity was determined with the [32pi]-molybdate extraction method and [ y-32p]-labeled atp
as a substrate [4,29,30]. ca2+-cam antagonists were
added to plastic eppendorf tubes containing 0.2 ml
reaction mixture of 5 mm mgc12, 100mm kci,
50 mm tris-maleate (ph 6.8, 37”), 0.1 mm [y-“~p]atp (10 mci/mmol). free ca2+ (0.29 or 12.2 pm as
indicated) was controlled in the sub-,um range by
buffering with 100 ,um ethylene glycol bis (p-amino
ethylether-n,n,n’,n’,-tetraacetic
acid (egta).
ionic strength, ph corrections and free ca2+ were
calculated by a computer program [14,17]. after
incubation at 37” for 5 min, the reactions were terminated by the addition 20 ,ul 20% trichloroacetic
acid (plus 5 mm pi) and the [32p]-molybdate complex
was extracted in isobutanol as described in detail
by ruitenbeek [31]. the drugs were added to the
reaction mixture in the form of stock dimethylsulfoxide (dmso) solutions, until the final medium
had a dmso concentration of 1% (v/v) independent
of the drug concentration
(controls without drug
included). dmso only slightly (5-10% inhibition)
affected enzyme activity.
assay of pde. pde was determined according to
a previously reported method [32] using [adeniner4c]-labeled camp as a substrate. the reactions were
carried out in a medium (0.2 ml) containing 5 mm
mgcl,, 100 mm kcl, 0.2 mm cac12, 10mm tris
(ph 7.5, 37”), 37.5 mm  xxxd26xxx ,
0.25 mm
[adenine-u-rjc]-camp,
calmodulin as indicated,
and 5 mu/ml of cam-deficient pde. the reactions
were stopped after 10 min incubation at 37” by adding
a 20 ~1 carrier solution of camp, adenosine and
amp each at 30 mm concentration and by immediate
placement of the eppendorf tubes in a 95” thermostat
bath for 10 min. the denatured protein was pelleted
by centrifugation at 12,000 g for 30 set and spotting
100 ~1of the supernatant on whatmann 3 mm paper.
[14c]-amp was separated from unreacted [14c]camp after an overnight descending
chromatography with an elution fluid composed of 30% 1 m
ammonium acetate and 70% ethanol (v/v). the spots
were visualized under u.v. light and paperstrips containing radioactive amp were directly counted by
liquid scintillation technique in 10 ml lumagel (pack-

oxidizer (packard) was used to completely destroy
the paperstrips before solubilization of the residue
in the lumagel. in these studies it was demonstrated
that counting of the intact paperstrips is sufficient
for estimating the adherent radioactivity.
results

effects of  xxxd2092xxx  and nifedipine
the inhibition of sl ca2+ pumping atpase by
 xxxd2092xxx  is shown in fig. 1. to determine whether
dihydropyridine inhibition is competitive with ca2+,
we also examined the effect of increasing ca2+ concentration on  xxxd2092xxx -induced
inhibition.  xxxd2092xxx  was tested at 20 and 50 ,&i concentrations.
increasing the ca2+ concentration
up to 100 pm,
which caused a decrease in atpase activity, slightly
modified the degree of inhibition of the ca2+ pumping atpase by  xxxd2092xxx  (fig. 1). thus,  xxxd2092xxx 
at ca2+ levels between 0 and 12 @l does not compete
with the binding of ca2+ to the membrane-bound
enzyme. this is an unexpected finding, in view of
the previously reported data on the potent anticam drug calmidazolium [14,27,33]. calmidazohum, tested at 20 pm concentration, exerted an inhibition of the sl ca2+ pumping atpase which was
competitive with respective to ca2+ ions [14]. it
should be noted that calmidazolium [cf. refs. 14 and
331 as well as  xxxd2092xxx  had a slightly inhibitory
effect on the basal atpase. this result supports the
cautionary
observations
of other investigators
[33-361 that cahnidazolium as well as other putative
cam antagonists may directly inhibit enzyme catalysis, independently
of any effects on ca2+ sites or
ca2+-cahnodulin. the different nature of inhibition
by  xxxd2092xxx  and calmidazolium on the ca2+ activation of sl ca2+ pumping atpase suggested that
their interaction with soluble cam-activated pde
might also be distinct. this was further tested by
examining the ability of cam (20-100nm) to alter
drug-induced
inhibition
of cam-activated
pde.

 xxxd2092xxx -induced inhibition (fig. 2) suggesting that
 xxxd2092xxx  does not compete with cam binding to
pde. this should be compared with the general
property of a number of very potent anti-cam drugs,
calmidazolium,
trifluoperazin,
w-7 and 48180, to
bind the ca2+-exposed hydrophobic site on cam
which prevents the binding of the ca2+-cam complex
to and the subsequent
activation
of pde
[5,7,11,33,35].
some of these characteristic cam
inhibitors (calmidazolium and trifluoperazin) have
previously been reported to inhibit sl ca2+ pumping
atpase in competition with cal+ ions [14,-17,18,
291. therefore, it was also suggested that the cam
subunit, endogenously
present in the sl ca2+
pumping atpase preparation,
contains, in fact,
the ca*+ activation site of the catalysis of atp
hydrolysis [14,18,19,32]. the results shown in figs.
1 and 2 suggest that  xxxd2092xxx  interacts with cam-

activated enzymes in a different manner as the putative cam antagonists. previously, stimulatory effects
of dihydropyridine ca2+ antagonists on the sl [21]
and sr [22,23,38] ca2+ pumping atpase even have
been described by testin! a wider range of drug
concentration
(10-7-10- m). therefore,
in the
present work the effects of  xxxd2092xxx  and nifedipine
were examined on the sl ca2+ pumping atpase at
2,5,10,20 and 50 ,um concentration. the results are
illustrated in fig. 3. it should be noted that in concentrations in which nifedipine did not inhibit the sl
ca2+ pumping atpase  xxxd2092xxx  markedly reduced
the activity (see also fig. 1). furthermore, a slightly
stimulatory action of nifedipine and  xxxd2092xxx  was
seen at 2 ,um, although it is very unlikely that this
small effect of the dihydropyridine
drug has any
significance
for
its pharmacological
action.

and  xxxd318xxx 

discussion

both  xxxd3007xxx  and  xxxd318xxx  belong to a group
of ca*+ slow channel blockers which are known to
interact with the intracellular ca*+ receptor cam
and to inhibit the cam-dependent activation of ca*+cam-dependent enzymes [7,13,39,40]. in fig. 4 the
concentration dependence of  xxxd3007xxx  inhibition
of soluble pde is compared to that of  xxxd318xxx  at
two different cam concentrations (20 and 100 nm).
 xxxd318xxx  displayed a competitive inhibition with
respect to cam at variance with the noncompetitive
effect of  xxxd3007xxx .  xxxd3007xxx  appears to be a
less potent inhibitor than  xxxd318xxx  at 20nm cam.
the present finding of competitive action of  xxxd318xxx 
with cam confirms previously reported data [39,40].
moreover, the sigmoid shape of the  xxxd318xxx  inhibition curve (fig. 4) may suggest the existence of
more than one binding site of the drug on calmodulin
having different affinities. the different nature of
interaction of  xxxd3007xxx  and  xxxd318xxx  with pde
made it useful to explore possible differences in
interaction of the drugs with the sl ca*+ pumping
atpase. as illustrated in fig. 5,  xxxd3007xxx 
(50 @i) is a very poor inhibitor of the ca*+ activated
part of the atpase, whereas  xxxd318xxx (50 @4) markedly reduced the ca2+ activated part of the atpase
activity at non-saturating
ca*+ concentrations
(0.29 @4). on the basis of the previous observations
with the drug calmidazolium, which also inhibited
gm-activated
pde competitively with cam, it is
not surprising that  xxxd318xxx  inhibition on the ca*+
pumping atpase is relieved by increasing ca*+ to
12.2 @f [14,32]. it is rather striking to see even a
moderate stimulation of the atpase by  xxxd318xxx  at a
(fig. 5). except for the
high ca*+ concentration

our studies demonstrate the ability of two slow
ca*+ channel blockers,  xxxd2092xxx  and  xxxd318xxx  to
inhibit the ca*+ pumping atpase of cardiac sl,
which membrane-bound
enzyme recently has been
recognized to be cam-regulated [14,17,19,32]. the
inhibition occurs most likely via binding to the cam
subunit of the atpase as the cam-dependent activation of the soluble enzyme camp-pde became
also inhibited at similar concentrations
(figs. 2
and 4 and compare
previous
reports
[refs.
8,10,13,37,41]).
furthermore,
 xxxd2092xxx ,
 xxxd3007xxx  and  xxxd318xxx  bind to cam as shown with a
wide variety of techniques: displacement of [3h]-w7 from cam [8,40], increase in fluorescence due
to ca2+-dependent complex formation between nphenyl-1-naphtyl amine and cam [8,13], fluorescence increase of dansylated cam in the presence of
ca*+ [5,7,26], [1251]-cam binding to erythrocyte
membranes [39] and [l13cd]-nmr spectra of (cd)dcam [3]. the use of the hydrophobic fluorescence
probes has shown that when ca2+ binds to its high
affinity sites of cam, it induces a conformational
change which exposes hydrophobic regions in the
cam protein. slow ca*+ channel blockers and the
known cam antagonists ( xxxd3431xxx ,
calmidazolium and w-7) bind to these hydrophobic sites
which has offered an explanation for the ca*+ dependence of drug binding. drug (e.g. calmidazolium and
diltiazem) binding sites on cam emerged from other
studies that could allosterically affect the binding of
 xxxd2092xxx  at a ca*+-induced hydrophobic site [5,26].

vided evidence that binding sites of  xxxd2092xxx  and
 xxxd3007xxx  on cam are different from those of the
potent anti-cam drugs tri~uoperazine,
calmidazolium and w-7 [s, 8,13,26], whereas  xxxd318xxx  binds
to a common site [8,40]. indeed, the present study
demonstrates that only  xxxd318xxx  inhibition of camppde is competitive with cam as previously found
for calmidazolium [ 141. that  xxxd3007xxx  was no
inhibitor of the ca*+-activated part of the ca”
pumping atpase, is not in agreement with its cam
binding potency [8,13] and its ability to inhibit
camp-pde (fig. 4). while none of the present
experiments conclusively demonstrates inhibition by
direct interaction of slow ca2+ channel blockers with
cam, when taken together, the data strongly suggest
that the interaction between  xxxd2092xxx  (or  xxxd3007xxx ) and cam is different from the interaction
between  xxxd318xxx  and cam.
selective binding and subsequent inactivation of
cam action may also result from differences in the
cam environment as some cam-activated enzymes
(cardiac sl ca2+ pumping atpase and phosphorylase b kinase) have previously been shown to
possess a cam subunit which remains bound to the
microsomal membrane vesicles, respectively, supernatant fractions after isolation [14--171. the cardiac
sl ca*” pumping atpase, described in the present
report, may therefore be useful for identification and
evaluation of other types of selectivity in anti-cam
action. it should be noted that the cardiac sl ca2+
pumping atpase has some properties that sets it
apart from the more extensively studied plasmamembrane ca2+ pumping atpase of the erythrocyte: (1) cam is bound more tightly to the cardiac
enzyme [ls]; (2) a complex regulatory system
mediated by camp- and ca2+-cam-activated protein kinases only is operative in cardiac sl membranes [reviewed in 421. fn u&o the latter protein
phosphorylation system can be activated by addition
of camp or ca2+-cam to the membranes, which
ingredients were both absent in the present experiments [14,17,30,32,42].
apparently cam required
for the action of the intrinsic protein kinase remains
not bound to the sl vesicles after isolation at variance with the cam operative in the direct ca2’
sensitivity regulation of the intrinsic ca2+ pumping
atpase. previously we demonstrated
that calmidazolium interacts with the sl ca2+ piping
atpase competitively with respect to ca2+ [ 141. the
present study shows that  xxxd2092xxx  inhibits the sl
ca2+ pumping
atpase
noncompetitively
with
respect to ca’+ in concentrations not far from those
effective in inhibiting camp-pde. that the effective
concentration of  xxxd2092xxx  in depressing sl ca2+
pumping atpase is higher than that against camppde is not surprising in view of our earlier observations with calmidazolium 1141. the sl membrane
protein concentration
used in the assay of ca2+
atpase critically determined the inhibitory potency
of calmidazolium. apparently, the lowered potency
to inhibit the sl ca2+ pumping atpase is due to
dilution of the lipophilic drug into the sl lipid
bilayer. in conclusion,  xxxd2092xxx  and  xxxd3007xxx 
possess specific anti-cam properties which do not
resemble those of caimidazolium because: (a) no
cam antagonism of drug action on soluble camp-

pde, (b) no ca2’ antagonism of drug action on
membrane-bound
heart sl ca2’ pumping atpase,
except for  xxxd3007xxx  which was unable to inhibit.
on the basis of the previously reported data [14]
and present results illustrated in fig. 4 a competitive
interaction with respect to ca2+ of  xxxd318xxx  with the
sl ca*+ pumping atpase is expected. our  xxxd318xxx 
studies rather indicate that the slight inhibition of
suboptimal ca2+ (0.29,um) can be reversed into a
stimulation at higher ca?* concentration (12.2 pm).
further studies are needed to determine more precisely the relation between ca2+ concentration and
 xxxd318xxx  interaction with heart sl ca*+ pumping
atpase. the significance of these observations is
that  xxxd318xxx  interacts with cam like calmidazolium,
 xxxd3431xxx  and w-7, but that in addition to its
inhibiting effect there may be an interaction with
cam or directly with the atpase, resulting into a
stimulation of the enzyme. one restriction should
be made to the latter interpretation.
previously we
demonstrated that by ca2’ pumping of the vesicle
atpase an electrochemical cal+ gradient may subsequently inhibit ca2+ pumping atpase.  xxxd318xxx 
might have uncoupled the uptake process from atp
hydrolysis by increasing vesicle ca2+ permeability
[43]. however, reported inhibition by 5-10hm
 xxxd318xxx  of contraction intact smooth muscle makes it
rather difficult to believe that  xxxd318xxx  would increase
membrane ca2+ permeability [40,44,45].  xxxd318xxx 
(10 pm) had a small inhibitory effect on ca2+ binding
to isolated sarcolemma, which result also is rather
unexpected if the drug would have increased sl ca2+
permeability [cf. ref. 461
in view of the observed stimulation of sl atpase
it is interesting that agre et al. [39] reported that
 xxxd318xxx  inhibited the erythrocyte caz* pumping
atpase, but competitive studies were restricted to
cam. another important aspect is whether stimulation of the ca2+ pumping atpase, as observed in
cardiac sl vesicles, is reflected by an increase of ca*+
uptake activity. however, proper interpretation of
such results will be difficult because of the abundant
presence of intact rightside-out vesicles and leaky
inside-out vesicles produce an extremely low coupling ratio of transported ca2+ over hydrolyzed atp
[17,29].
the effects on sl ca2+ pumping atpase, may
provide a model for understanding the interaction of
various ca*+ antagonists with membrane proteins
which mediate active ca2+ extrusion from the myocardial cell. it also provides additional information
on the selectivity in cam inhibition, when one wants
to compare
different
types of cam-activated
enzymes. it should be stressed, however, that the
described effects of  xxxd2092xxx  are first seen at concentrations far above those which are therapeutically
interesting. since the structural analog nifedipine in
&i amounts had almost no effect on the sl ca”+
pumping atpase and camp-pde and 1,4 dihydropyridines exert their vasodilator action in the
nanomolar range, it seems not plausible that this
class of drugs act in the therapeutical ranges through
inhibition of cam activated enzymes f 19,24,37,41].
on the other hand, recent reports demonstrate that
 xxxd318xxx  on concentrations between 10e6 and loa m
depressed contractions of intact [40,44-45] as well

slow calcium channel blockers and calmodulin
as skinned smooth muscle fibers [40,45]. this is
within the range presently shown to be effective
in interacting with cam-activated enzyme systems.
therefore the vasodilatory action of  xxxd318xxx  in intact
smooth muscle may be partially dependent on its
stimulatory effect on sl ca2+ pumping atpase and
inhibitory action on the  xxxg1491xxx  [40]. this is even
more likely if one takes into account the large
accumulation of  xxxd318xxx  that occurs in muscle in
comparison with other slow ca*+ channel blocking
drugs, e.g. nifedipine, diltiazem and verapamil [cf.
refs. 47 and 481. bkaily et al. [49] reported recently
that  xxxd3431xxx  injection into chick embryo cells
blocked ca2+ slow inward current. this supports the
work of johnson and wittenauer [7] which led them
to postulate of the existence of a cam-like protein
that controls the ca2+ dependent ca*+ channel closing. both studies including the present investigation
indicate that slow ca*+ channel blockers may exert
their action on the ca2+ channel as well as the ca*+
pumping atpase by affecting their cam regulation.
