background: although currently available 5-hydroxytryptamine type 3 receptor (5-ht3) antagonists are

introduction
nausea and vomiting associated with highly emetogenic chemotherapy such as cisplatin-based regimens are mediated by 5hydroxytryptamine release by gut enterochromaffin cells [1].
emesis can be acute (occurring within 24 h of chemotherapy),
delayed (beginning 24–48 h after chemotherapy), or in anticipation of chemotherapy [2]. chemotherapy-induced nausea and
vomiting (cinv) may result in dehydration, malnutrition or
electrolyte imbalance, which can affect quality of life, the desire to
continue antitumor therapy, and survival [3, 4]. since their introduction, 5-hydroxytryptamine type 3 receptor (5-ht3) antagonists
have become the most frequently used agents in the control of
emesis resulting from moderately to highly emetogenic chemotherapy [5]. although 5-ht3 antagonists are currently the stand-

ard therapy for preventing cinv, not all patients achieve adequate
control with these agents, and those currently marketed agents
have limited efficacy in the treatment of delayed emesis [2, 6, 7].
therefore, there is a need to investigate new treatments and regimens in an effort to improve the therapeutic response.
 xxxd2834xxx  is a potent and selective 5-ht3 antagonist with a
high affinity for 5-ht3 receptors (pki = 10.45 in cultured mouse
neuroblastoma–rat glioma hybridoma cells) [8] compared with
granisetron (pki = 8.91 in cultured mouse neuroblastoma–rat
glioma hybridoma cells) [8], ondansetron (pki = 8.39 in cultured
mouse neuroblastoma–rat glioma hybridoma cells) [8],  xxxd1924xxx 
(pki = 7.6 in cultured neuroblastoma glioma cells) [9],  xxxd3451xxx 
(pki = 8.81 in cultured mouse neuroblastoma–rat glioma hybridoma cells) [8, 10], and azasetron (ki = 0.33 nm in the small intestines of rats) [11]. in contrast to other 5-ht3 antagonists that exist
as racemic mixtures,  xxxd2834xxx  exists as a single stereoisomer,
with improved pharmacological and pharmacokinetic profiles
[12]. in preclinical studies,  xxxd2834xxx  demonstrated potent
antiemetic properties in several standard animal models [13]. in

effective, not all patients receiving these agents achieve adequate control of chemotherapy-induced nausea and
vomiting (cinv).  xxxd2834xxx , a potent and highly selective 5-ht3 antagonist with a strong affinity for 5-ht3
and a prolonged plasma elimination half-life, may provide a longer duration of action than other approved
agents.
patients and methods: one hundred and sixty-one patients were randomly assigned to receive a single intravenous bolus dose of  xxxd2834xxx  (0.3, 1, 3, 10, 30 or 90 µg/kg) before administration of highly emetogenic
chemotherapy, with no pretreatment with corticosteroids.
results: the four highest doses of  xxxd2834xxx  were similarly effective during the first 24 h, producing clearly
higher complete response (cr) (no emesis, no rescue medication) rates in the 3, 10, 30 and 90 µg/kg groups
(46%, 40%, 50% and 46%, respectively) than in the 0.3–1 µg/kg group (24%) of evaluable patients (n = 148).
the 3 µg/kg dose was identified as the lowest effective dose. a single dose of  xxxd2834xxx  showed prolonged
efficacy in preventing delayed emesis, with approximately one-third of patients who received  xxxd2834xxx 
10 or 30 µg/kg maintaining a cr throughout the 7-day period following chemotherapy administration. doseproportional increases in pharmacokinetic parameters and a long plasma half-life (43.7–128 h) were observed.
 xxxd2834xxx  was well-tolerated, with no dose–response effect evident for the incidence or intensity of adverse
events.
conclusions:  xxxd2834xxx  is an effective and well-tolerated agent for the prevention of cinv following
highly emetogenic chemotherapy, with 3 and 10 µg/kg identified as the lowest effective  xxxd2834xxx  doses.

previous phase i studies in healthy volunteers, intravenous (i.v.)
 xxxd2834xxx  (0.3–90 µg/kg) was found to be well-tolerated, with
mean plasma elimination half-life (t1/2) values of ∼40 h [13], substantially longer than that of ondansetron (4–6 h) [14], hydrodolasetron (the active metabolite of  xxxd1924xxx ; 7 h) [15], granisetron
(5–8 h),  xxxd3451xxx  (7 h) and azasetron (9 h) [2, 16, 17]. its high
antiemetic potency, high binding affinity, and longer t1/2 give
 xxxd2834xxx  the potential to provide more complete and prolonged protection against cinv compared with currently available
5-ht3 antagonists. the primary objective of this study was to
determine the dose–response relationship of single i.v. doses of
 xxxd2834xxx  (0.3–90 µg/kg) in chemotherapy-naive patients
receiving highly emetogenic chemotherapy, in order to identify
the lowest effective  xxxd2834xxx  dose that produces maximal
efficacy. additional objectives included the assessment of safety
and the pharmacokinetics of  xxxd2834xxx  over the range of doses
evaluated.

subjects
patients at least 18 years of age with histologically proven cancer who were
chemotherapy-naive and scheduled to receive their first dose of highly emetogenic chemotherapy (≥70 mg/m2 cisplatin or >1100 mg/m2 cyclophosphamide)
[18] were enrolled. patients were required to have a karnofsky performance
status ≥60% and acceptable hepatic function (transaminases <2× upper limit of
normal) and renal function (creatinine clearance ≥50 ml/min).
exclusion criteria included severe, uncontrolled, concurrent illness other
than neoplasia; unstable metastases to the brain; a history of seizures during
adulthood; gastric outlet or intestinal obstruction; known vomiting within 24 h
preceding  xxxd2834xxx  dosing; a known hypersensitivity to other 5-ht3
antagonists; previous or current exposure to highly emetogenic chemotherapies
(i.e.  xxxd1796xxx , nitrosoureas or  xxxd2551xxx ); and participation in
another drug study or receipt of any investigational agents within 30 days of
study entry. patients were excluded if they had received, within 24 h before
receipt of study medication, any antiemetic, sedative, corticosteroid, or other
drug, that, in the opinion of the investigator, could influence the results of the
study. all patients (men and women) were required to practice adequate contraception for 1 month after  xxxd2834xxx  dosing.

study design
this was a randomized, double-blind, multicenter, parallel-design study conducted within the united states. thirty minutes before the start of scheduled
administration of highly emetogenic chemotherapy, patients received a single
i.v. bolus of  xxxd2834xxx  0.3, 1, 3, 10, 30 or 90 µg/kg over 30 s. initial  xxxd2834xxx  dosing ranged from 0.3–30 µg/kg. however, because the lowest dose
(0.3 µg/kg) was thought to possibly be too low to provide adequate protection
against cinv, a protocol amendment eliminated the use of this dose and a
90 µg/kg dose group was added, without breaking the study-blind. efficacy
data from the two patients who received the 0.3 µg/kg dose were pooled with
the 1 µg/kg group data. no concomitant corticosteroids were administered
prophylactically. for ethical reasons, placebo was not a feasible option for a
control group.
all patients were observed in the hospital or clinic for a minimum of 6 h
after dosing and subsequently followed for 14 days after administration of
 xxxd2834xxx . blood samples from patients at selected study sites were collected at specific intervals for pharmacokinetic analysis. the study protocol
was approved by the institutional review board of each participating study

study visits and assessment procedures
during the week before  xxxd2834xxx  dosing, patients underwent a complete
physical examination, laboratory assessment (i.e. hematology, blood chemistry, urinalysis), vital sign measurement, and 12-lead electrocardiogram
(ecg). one hour before the start of chemotherapy, sitting blood pressure and
heart rate were measured, and patients completed a pre-dose nausea assessment that consisted of a categorical scale of nausea (none, mild, moderate, or
severe). blood pressure and heart rate were measured 20 min before chemotherapy initiation, throughout the 6-h observation period following treatment,
and at 24 h after the start of chemotherapy. patients used diary cards to report
the number of emetic episodes and degree of nausea at 2, 4, 8, 12 and 24 h after
the start of chemotherapy, as well as time of their first emetic episode (if any).
patient satisfaction with control of nausea and vomiting was evaluated every
24 h via a 100-mm visual analog scale ranging from 0 (not at all satisfied) to
100 (completely satisfied). patients were instructed to continue to record
emetic episodes for 1 week after dosing and to rate, on a daily basis, the degree
of nausea or the sensation of having to vomit and the degree of satisfaction
with the control of nausea and vomiting.
twenty-four hours following chemotherapy initiation, patients returned to
the clinic (if not hospitalized) to report adverse events (aes) and concomitant
medications and to undergo a limited physical examination, a 12-lead ecg,
blood tests and urinalysis. patients again returned to the clinic 1 week after
dosing for a limited physical examination, clinical laboratory evaluation, and a
12-lead ecg if the 24-h ecg was significantly different from the screening
ecg. aes and concomitant medications were recorded and diary cards were
collected. all patients were contacted 14 days after dosing and questioned
regarding nausea and vomiting, concomitant medications and aes. any aes
that persisted beyond the 14-day follow-up period were followed until resolution or explanation, or until 1 month after the dose.
therapeutic response was evaluated by recording the occurrence of an
emetic episode, the degree of nausea, and the need for rescue medication. an
emetic episode was defined as (i) a single vomit of solid or liquid gastric contents; (ii) a single retch, or ‘dry heave’, that did not produce solid or liquid
gastric contents; or (iii) any episode of continuous vomiting or retching. episodes separated from each other by the absence of retching or vomiting for at
least 1 min were considered separate emetic episodes. rescue medication
could be administered according to standard practice at each participating
institution following the first emetic episode or succeeding episodes, or at
the request of the patient. a complete response (cr) was defined as no emetic
episode and no rescue medication; complete control (cc) was defined as no
emetic episode, no rescue medication, and no more than mild nausea. efficacy
for acute (0–24 h) and delayed (2–7 days) cinv was determined. treatment
was considered to be a failure (i.e. unsatisfactory therapeutic response) if a
patient had at least one emetic episode or received rescue medication.
for patients participating in the pharmacokinetic portion of the study, 7 ml
of whole blood were drawn into heparinized vacuum tubes 30 min before, and
0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 12, 24, 48, 72, 120 and 168 h after the administration
of  xxxd2834xxx . as only two patients received  xxxd2834xxx  0.3 µg/kg, this
dose level was not included in the pharmacokinetic portion of the study.
plasma was separated from whole blood by centrifugation and stored at –20°c.
plasma samples were assayed for  xxxd2834xxx  and its n-oxide metabolite
(metabolite m9) using a validated high-pressure liquid chromatography
method, with detection and quantification of each analyte via single-ion monitoring mass spectrometry. the lower limit of quantification was 0.020 ng/ml
for  xxxd2834xxx  and 0.050 ng/ml for metabolite m9. standard pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated by non-compartmental methods.
aes occurring in the study were documented during the 24 h after dosing,
on day 7, and on day 14. events were assessed by the investigator for intensity

and possible association with study medication. all reported events were
followed until the overall clinical outcome was ascertained or until 1 month
after dosing.
the primary outcome variable was the proportion of patients with a cr
during the 24-h period following the start of chemotherapy. this was also evaluated each day cumulatively for 7 days following chemotherapy. secondary
measures, assessed each day for 7 days after chemotherapy initiation, included:
proportion of patients experiencing cc of emesis following the start of chemotherapy; time to treatment failure (first emetic episode or rescue medication);
time to first emetic episode; time to rescue medication; number of patients free
from emetic episodes and with a maximum of mild nausea; number of patients
free of emetic episodes with no rescue medication; number of patients free
from emetic episodes with no rescue medication and no nausea; and global
assessment of nausea (assessed only at 24 h).

statistical analyses

efficacy analyses were carried out on the itt population (156
patients) and the pp population (148 patients). the majority (156
of 161) of enrolled patients received cisplatin (median dose
96 mg/m2). to provide for a more homogeneous study population,
the five patients who received cyclophosphamide-based therapy
were excluded from efficacy analyses. an additional eight patients
were excluded from efficacy analyses due to receipt of prohibited
concomitant medication (four patients), low cisplatin dose and/or
a slow infusion time (three patients), and patient unreliability (one
patient).
patient characteristics are summarized in table 1. treatment
groups were generally balanced with respect to demographic variables and medical history. there were no clinically meaningful
differences between groups with regard to age, gender, race, weight,
height, emetogenic chemotherapy agent, body surface area and
tobacco and alcohol use within the past 6 months.

the primary efficacy hypothesis of the study was that there was no difference
in the proportion of patients with a cr between the 0.3 or 1 µg/kg dose and any
of the higher i.v. doses (3, 10, 30 and 90 µg/kg). the number of patients to be
included in the study was estimated to be 115 patients (23 patients for five dose
groups), assuming a responder rate of the lowest dose group of 20% and a cr
rate of the higher dose group of at least 70%.
statistical analyses were carried out using sas software, version 6.08
(sas institute, inc., cary, nc, usa). significance of group differences in
efficacy parameters was determined at an alpha level of 0.05 using two-sided
tests; comparability among groups with respect to baseline characteristics was
made at the 0.10 level. the cochran–mantel–haenszel test, stratified by
center, was used to test the significance of differences in cr rates between the
lowest-dose group (pooled 0.3 and 1 µg/kg doses) and each of the other dose
groups. additionally, a 95% confidence interval (ci) (adjusted for multiple
cis) for the true difference in cr rates between the combined 0.3 and 1 µg/kg
groups and each of the other dose groups was obtained using dunnett’s
method, modified for a dichotomous response [19]. treatment group differences for the other binary efficacy variables were analyzed similarly. comparisons in the time-to-event distributions were assessed using the log-rank test.
the wilcoxon rank-sum test was used for comparisons of the area under the
categorical nit curve, while tests involving overall assessment of nausea were
based on the cochran–mantel–haenszel test stratified by center. for the cr
rate at 24 h, analyses were carried out for both intention-to-treat (itt) and
per-protocol (pp) populations; the other parameters were analyzed only for the
evaluable patients (pp population). safety data were tabulated and summarized descriptively. maximum plasma concentration (cmax) and area under the
plasma concentration–time curve (auc) were tested for dose-proportionality
with a one-way analysis of variance controlling for dose level. dose proportionality of plasma elimination t1/2, total body clearance (clt), and apparent
volume of distribution (vd) was evaluated without adjusting for dose.

one hundred and sixty-one patients were enrolled in the study at
23 sites. all patients were included in the safety evaluation, while

efficacy
in the pp population, a cr was achieved in 24%, 46%, 40%, 50%
and 46% of patients in the 0.3–1, 3, 10, 30 and 90 µg/kg groups,
respectively, during the first 24 h following chemotherapy administration (figure 1). the lowest-dose group (0.3–1 µg/kg) had a
clearly inferior response rate compared with the higher-dose
groups, with differences between groups reaching significance in
the 30 µg/kg group (p <0.05). rates of cc were only slightly
lower than rates of cr, with the lowest-dose group again appearing to show a lesser response to antiemetic therapy than those
receiving the higher doses. the percentage of patients free from
emetic episodes during the 24 h following chemotherapy ranged
from 31% (for the 0.3–1 µg/kg group) to 58% (for the 3 and 30 µg/kg
groups), with 29–57% of patients free from emetic episodes and
experiencing none-to-mild nausea (0.3–1 µg/kg group and 30 µg/kg
group, respectively). in general, about one-third of patients in the
higher-dose groups experienced a total response (i.e. no emetic
episodes, no rescue medication, and no nausea).

median time to first emetic episode was also longer in the four
highest dose groups compared with the 0.3–1 µg/kg group.
median times to first emetic episode were statistically significantly higher in the 3, 30 and 90 µg/kg groups than in the lowestdose group (p = 0.008, 0.012 and 0.007, respectively) (table 2).
similarly, time to rescue medication was significantly longer in
the 3, 30 and 90 µg/kg dose groups than in the 0.3–1 µg/kg group
(p = 0.043, 0.022 and 0.015, respectively) (table 2). when
patients were assessed according to time to treatment failure (i.e.
time to first emetic episode or time to rescue medication), the differences between the lowest-dose and the higher-dose groups were

even more striking. median time to treatment failure was 5.6, 22.7,
19.0, >24 and 21.8 h, respectively. patients who received higher
doses of  xxxd2834xxx  also experienced less nausea during the first
24 h after chemotherapy than those who received 0.3–1 µg/kg
doses, with significant differences in the 3, 30 and 90 µg/kg
groups.
a single dose of  xxxd2834xxx  showed prolonged efficacy in
preventing delayed emesis, with approximately one-third of patients
who received  xxxd2834xxx  10 or 30 µg/kg maintaining a cr
throughout the 7-day period following chemotherapy administration (figure 2). these data suggest a prolonged efficacy of palono-

who were free from emetic episodes throughout days 1–7 ranged
from 26% to 38% for the four highest  xxxd2834xxx  doses, with
25–50% free from rescue medication.

safety
one hundred and twenty-nine of 161 patients (80.1%) experienced
at least one ae during the 14-day study period after administration of  xxxd2834xxx , with the majority of aes (86%) considered
not related to the study medication. the most frequently reported
drug-related aes (i.e. adverse reactions) were headache and
constipation (table 3). most aes (83.9%) were rated as mild or
moderate in intensity by the investigator. serious aes were
reported for 25 patients (15.5%). however, none of these serious
aes were considered to be related to study drug; instead, they
were usually considered to be secondary to the patient’s chemotherapy or underlying disease. there was no apparent dose–

available data allowed for calculation of  xxxd2834xxx  pharmacokinetics in 35 patients. mean  xxxd2834xxx  plasma concentrations
for the various dosage groups are illustrated in figure 3 and the
computed pharmacokinetic parameters of  xxxd2834xxx  and metabolite m9 are summarized in table 5. plasma  xxxd2834xxx 
concentrations declined biexponentially—with an initial rapid distribution phase followed by a slower elimination from the body —
and were measurable up to 168 h after the dose. mean cmax values
ranged from 0.89 to 336 ng/ml and were generally proportional to
the dose. similarly, auc values increased dose-proportionally,
with auc from time zero to infinity (auc0–∞) ranging from
13.8 ng•h/ml in the 1 µg/kg group to 957 ng•h/ml in the 90 µg/kg
group. mean clt of  xxxd2834xxx  ranged from 1.51 to 2.23 ml/min/kg,
indicating low clearance compared with hepatic blood flow
(approximately 20 ml/min/kg). vd was large, with mean values
ranging from 6.83 to 12.5 l/kg, consistent with extensive distribution into tissue. the low clt and large vd resulted in a long t1/2,
with mean values ranging from 43.7 to 128 h. although there was
interpatient variability for many of the pharmacokinetic parameters, there were no statistically significant differences between
dosage groups for any parameter, demonstrating dose-proportionality. mean plasma concentrations of metabolite m9 were low
relative to the parent compound, with plasma concentrations not
measurable in most samples at the 1 and 3 µg/kg dose levels.
mean cmax values for metabolite m9 ranged from 0.055 to
0.855 ng/ml across the five dose levels. the ratios of auc0–∞ for
metabolite to parent drug averaged between 0.079 and 0.118.

response relationship for the occurrence of aes. the incidence,
intensity and relationship of aes to study medication were generally similar between the various  xxxd2834xxx  dose levels, indicating no apparent dose–response relationship for the occurrence of
aes (data not shown). no clinically meaningful differences
between treatment groups were observed for heart rate, blood
pressure or other laboratory parameters evaluated. results of ecg
recordings showed no dose-dependent changes in any interval,
including qt/qtc intervals (table 4).

discussion
the results of this study show that  xxxd2834xxx , administered in
the absence of pretreatment with corticosteroids, is an effective
antiemetic agent among patients receiving highly emetogenic
cisplatin-based chemotherapy. a cr (no emetic episode and no
rescue medication) was achieved in 40–50% of the patients in the
3–90 µg/kg dose groups in the 24-h period following chemotherapy, with 39–48% of patients experiencing cc (no emetic
episode, no rescue medication, and no more than mild nausea)
during the same time period. a single i.v. dose of  xxxd2834xxx 
also showed prolonged efficacy in preventing delayed emesis,
with approximately one-third of patients who received  xxxd2834xxx  10 or 30 µg/kg experiencing a cr through the 7 days after
administration of chemotherapy. a dose–response relationship
for efficacy of the higher doses of  xxxd2834xxx  was not observed
at doses above the lowest effective dose of 3.0 µg/kg [20–25].
similarly, with other 5-ht3 antagonists, dose–response relation-

ships for efficacy above a minimal threshold dose are generally
not found. for example, a single i.v. dose of granisetron 40 µg/kg
was found to be as effective as 160 µg/kg in three dose-ranging
studies, with efficacy clearly lower at doses <10 µg/kg. two
studies of  xxxd1924xxx  also failed to demonstrate a dose–response
relationship [24, 26], with one of the studies identifying a dose of
1.8 mg/kg as suboptimal [26]. results of two dose-ranging studies
of ondansetron are inconsistent, with one study reporting no difference in efficacy between a single i.v. dose of ondansetron 8 and
32 mg [25], and the other study reporting substantially greater
efficacy with the higher dose following moderately and highly
emetogenic chemotherapy [27].
 xxxd2834xxx  was well-tolerated, with no unexpected aes
reported. only a small proportion of events (approximately 15%)
were considered possibly or probably related to study medication,
with the majority (>80%) of aes considered mild-to-moderate in
intensity. importantly, incidences, frequencies, intensities and
drug relationships of aes appear to be equally distributed among

the various  xxxd2834xxx  dose levels, with no apparent dose–
response relationships.
over the range of doses evaluated, both cmax and auc0–∞
values increased with increasing dose in a dose-proportional
manner, within the range 1–90 µg/kg. vd of  xxxd2834xxx  was
large (6.8–2.5 l/kg) and clt was low (1.51–2.23 ml/min/kg),
resulting in a long plasma elimination t1/2 (>44 h). the exposure
of metabolite m9 relative to  xxxd2834xxx  as determined by auc
ratio was low (0.079–0.118). this finding, coupled with the negligible pharmacological activity of metabolite m9 (data on file),
suggests that the antiemetic effect observed in patients is mainly
due to  xxxd2834xxx . pharmacokinetics of  xxxd2834xxx  in this
dose-ranging study were similar to studies in healthy volunteers
[28], and are improved over other 5-ht3 antagonists due to its long
t1/2, dose-proportional pharmacokinetics, large vd, and low clt.
in summary,  xxxd2834xxx  showed substantial efficacy in the
prevention of cinv in patients receiving highly emetogenic
cisplatin-based chemotherapy. the prolonged protection observed
with  xxxd2834xxx  in the management of chemotherapy-induced
emesis following a single i.v. dose is particularly notable and is
likely related to its strong binding affinity for 5-ht3 receptors and
its longer plasma elimination t1/2. the pharmacokinetics of  xxxd2834xxx  in this study were similar to those previously reported in
phase i trials. based on the results of this dose-ranging study, fixed
 xxxd2834xxx  doses of 0.25 mg (∼3 µg/kg) and 0.75 mg (∼10 µg/kg)
are recommended for further evaluation, as they appear to be the
lowest effective doses for the prevention of cinv in patients
receiving highly emetogenic chemotherapy.
