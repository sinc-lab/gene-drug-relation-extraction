summary: in 13 normotensive subjects on a normal so-
dium diet, we studied renal vascular, blood pressure, and
hormonal changes induced by infusion of exogenous an-
giotensin ii (ang ii) (5 ng/kg/min) during baseline con-
ditions and after 5 days of  xxxd1694xxx  administration. in
both conditions, ang ii elicited a slight pressor response
accompanied by renal hemodynamic and hormonal
changes that were similar. this suggests that hourly
changes in ang ii concentrations and/or in ang ii recep-

in normotensive subjects, angiotensin-converting
enzyme (ace) inhibitors have been found to induce
renal hemodynamic changes, including renal vaso-
dilation and natriuresis, and less consistently to de-
crease blood pressure, depending upon supine po-
sition, sodium content of the diet, and initial blood
pressure (1-4). however, during chronic ace in-
hibitor treatment, vascular reactivity to endogenous
 xxxg99xxx  (ang ii) could be affected by several
factors, including upregulation of the number or
density of vascular receptors to ang ii (5), and dis-
sociation between persistent ace inhibition and
hourly changes in plasma ang ij concentrations (6).
in the present study in healthy normotensive sub-
jects, the vascular reactivity to exogenous ang ii
was compared before and after short-term ace in-
hibition. our results clearly showed that exogenous
ang ii had similar effects on renal hemodynamics,
sodium excretion, blood pressure, and hormonal
changes, whether administered under baseline con-
ditions or superimposed on short-term ace inhi-
bition.

tor density after short-term administration of the angio-
tensin-converting enzyme (ace) inhibitor  xxxd1694xxx  does
not significantly affect renal vascular reactivity. in ad-
dition, these results also indirectly suggest that most of
the renal effects of ace inhibition are mediated through
suppression of ang ii formation. key words: angiotensin

patients and methods

thirteen healthy normotensive subjects (7 males), aged
29 + 1 years, participated in the study after giving in-
formed consent. all were receiving a controlled normal
sodium diet (100—120 mmol/24 h) and none took any other
drug during the study. renal function was studied im-
mediately before and 5 days after once-daily oral admin-
istration of  xxxd1694xxx  2.5 mg (the last dose being given 1
h before the initiation of the second renal study).

clearances were performed in the  xxxd2476xxx  over-
night fasting, as previously described (4) using a constant
rate infusion of inulin (polyfructosan, inutest) and p-ami-
nohippuric acid (pah, nephrotest) and six consecutive
clearance periods of 30 min each. urine was collected
every 30 min by spontaneous voiding and blood speci-
mens were drawn at the beginning and the end of each
collection period. after the end of period 3, angio ii-
amide (hypertensin, ciba, basel, switzerland) was in-
fused at a constant rate of 5 ng/kg/min; mean arterial pres-
sures (map) were measured using an automatic device
(dinamap, critikon, tampa, fl, u.s.a.; cuff size of 23
x 13cm) every 10 min during clearance evaluation. sam-

creased slightly whereas plasma renin activity in-
creased, which is consistent with removal of ang
ii-mediated feedback of renin release (2,6).

chronic treatment with ace inhibitors may upre-
gulate the number or density of vascular receptors
to ang ii (5), which could increase the renal vas-
cular reactivity to angiotensin. moreover, it has re-
cently been shown that inhibition of ace and
suppression of ang ii formation are dissociated. in-
deed, the small amount of ace activity not inhib-
ited by the ace inhibitor and the increase in pra
due to initial removal of ang ii-mediated feedback
of renin release were found to result in a significant
recovery of ang ii concentration, which rose by
50% or more of initial values in the 4—6 h following
ace inhibition (6).

we were therefore interested in studying whether
prior short-term ace inhibition may affect the renal
and hormonal responses to exogenous angiotensin.
in both settings, ang ii induced similar significant
renal and systemic vasoconstriction whereas glo-
merular filtration was unchanged.  xxxg99xxx 
consistently exerted a profound antinatriuretic ef-
fect that is probably mediated both through a direct
tubular effect and through hemodynamic changes
(12).

our results clearly showed that a slight pressor
dose of ang ii had comparable effects upon renal
hemodynamic and hormonal changes, regardless of
whether it is administered in baseline conditions or
superimposed onto short-term ace inhibition. this
suggests that hourly changes in ang ii concentra-
tions and/or in ang ii receptor density after re-
peated once-daily ace inhibitor administration do
not significantly affect renal vascular reactivity.

although blockade of ang ii formation is re-
sponsible for a large part of the effects of ace in-
hibition on renal hemodynamics and sodium excre-
tion, ace inhibitors, which also reduce degradation
of kinins, may have additional effects by enhancing
the availability of this peptide. as the same dose of
ang ii exerted similar effects on renal hemodynam-
ics, sodium excretion, and blood pressure, our re-
sults also indirectly suggest that most, if not all, of
the renal effects of  xxxd1694xxx  are mediated through
suppression of ang ii formation, as previously sug-
gested by studies in dogs (12,13).
