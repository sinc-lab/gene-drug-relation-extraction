abstract
the present study characterizes the involvement of the nmethyl-d- xxxd233xxx  receptors (nmdars) in mediating thermal hyperalgesia induced by activation of group i metabotropic
glutamate receptors (mglurs). intrathecal administration of the
 xxxg972xxx /5 agonist (s)-3,5- xxxd2178xxx  [(s)-3,5-dihydroxyphenylglycine] to mice resulted in significant hyperalgesia as assessed
by the tail immersion test. the pretreatment of mice i.t. with

first time that i.t. injection of psm2 (pshag magic version 2) xxxg965xxx  (coding for an short-hairpin rna to the nr2b subunit of
the nmdar) resulted in a dose-dependent decrease in the
nr2b protein and blockade of hyperalgesia induced by activation of the  xxxg972xxx /5 in (s)-3,5- xxxd2178xxx - treated mice. taken
together, our results suggest the hypothesis that mglurs are
coupled to the nmdar channels through the nr2b subunit in
the spinal cord and that this coupling involves the activation of
protein kinase c and  xxxg1836xxx .

glutamate primarily activates the ionotropic non-n-methyl-daspartic acid (non-nmda) type ␣-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4isoxazolepropionic acid and kainate receptors (yoshimura and
jessell, 1990), whereas in superficial (lamina i) and deep dorsal

activation occurs in control conditions (millan, 1999). several

the role of nmda-nr2b subunit in mglur-induced hyperalgesia

genes encoding nmdar subunits have been identified. these
genes fall into three categories: nmda-r1 subunit (nr1), a to
d isoforms of nmda-r2 subunit ( xxxg964xxx -d), and nmda-r3
subunit (kutsuwada et al., 1992). although nmdar stimulation enhances synaptic transmission in the dorsal horn of the
spinal cord, activation of the g-protein-coupled metabotropic
glutamate receptors (mglurs) serves mainly to modulate synaptic neurotransmission (pin and acher, 2002). eight subtypes
of mglurs have been identified and divided in three groups on
the basis of pharmacological and signal transduction mechanisms and amino acid homology. group i mglurs ( xxxg972xxx /5)
are linked to phospholipase c and the activation of protein
kinase c (pkc). group ii mglurs (mglur2/3) and group iii
mglurs ( xxxg973xxx /6/7/8) are negatively coupled to adenylyl cyclase through gi/go to decrease camp accumulation (conn and
pin, 1997).
interestingly, group i mglurs have been demonstrated to
interact biochemically with nmdars in vitro. for example,
activating  xxxg972xxx  potentiated nmdar currents in xenopus
oocytes, leading to an increase in intracellular ca2⫹ and
activation of pkc (lan et al., 2001). furthermore, in mice
cortical slices, nmda-induced depolarization was enhanced
by the selective  xxxg972xxx /5 agonist (s)-3,5-dihydroxyphenylglycine [(s)-3,5- xxxd2178xxx ] and blocked by the selective  xxxg974xxx 
antagonist 2-methyl-6-(phenylethynyl)-pyridine (mpep) (attucci et al., 2001). in contrast to in vitro studies, in vivo
studies have been conducted to examine the potential coupling between group i mglurs and nmdars in mediating
nociception in animals. the role of group i mglurs in nociception has been well established, but less is known about
the functional interaction between those receptors and the
nmdars. activation of group i mglurs has been demonstrated to produce nociception in animals. intrathecal administration of (s)-3,5- xxxd2178xxx  was shown to induce persistent
thermal hyperalgesia and mechanical allodynia (fisher and
coderre, 1998). in addition, carrageenan-induced thermal
and mechanical hyperalgesia in rats with hindpaw inflammation were blocked by i.t. of the group i mglurs antagonist
(s)-4-carboxy-3-hydroxyphenylglycine [(s)-4c3hpg] (young
et al., 1997).
there is considerable evidence that pain associated with
peripheral tissue or nerve injury involves nmdar activation
(doubell et al., 1999). consistent with this, nmdar antagonists have been shown to effectively alleviate pain-related
behavior in animal models as well as in clinical situations
(fisher et al., 2000; hewitt, 2000). however, nmdars are
important for normal central nervous system functions, and
the use of nmdar antagonists can often be limited by serious side effects, such as memory impairment, psychotomimetic effects, ataxia, motor incoordination, hallucinations,
and agitation (petrenko et al., 2003). newly developed
nmdar antagonists at the glycine site, nr2b sites, and
weak-binding channel blockers have demonstrated an improved side effect profile in animal models of pain (brown
and krupp, 2006). other recent studies indicate that modulating the activity of nmdars with group i mglurs drugs
might be effective in treating chronic pain (guo et al., 2004),
thus limiting the incidence of nmda-like side effects. the
goal of this study was to use a model of thermal hyperalgesia
to investigate the mechanisms by which group i mglurs
interact with nmdars. the hypothesis that pharmacologi-

187

cal stimulation of group i mglurs results in the concomitant
activation of nmda receptors was tested.
we also evaluated, for the first time, the interaction between the mglurs and the nr2b subunit of the nmdar at
a molecular level. functional nr2b-containing nmdars are
formed by their coassembly with the obligatory nr1 subunits
(masuko et al., 1999). the nr1 subunits are ubiquitously
expressed in the central nervous system, whereas the nr2b
protein is localized predominantly in the superficial dorsal
horn of the spinal cord (boyce et al., 1999). therefore, another aim was to investigate the role of nr2b receptor subunit in the modulation of (s)-3,5- xxxd2178xxx -induced thermal hyperalgesia using a more selective experimental tool of small
interfering rna that involves a double-stranded short-hairpin rna (shrna) specifically silencing the mouse nr2b.

drugs and chemicals. the following agents were purchased
from tocris cookson bioscience (ellisville, mo): (s)-3,5-dihydroxyphenylglycine [(s)-3,5- xxxd2178xxx ;  xxxg972xxx /5 agonist]; ␣-amino-5-carboxy-3-methyl-2-thiopheneacetic acid (3-matida;  xxxg972xxx  antagonist; moroni et al., 2002); mpep hydrochloride ( xxxg974xxx  antagonist);
cis-4-[phosphomethyl]-piperidine-2-carboxylic acid (cgs 19755;
selective competitive nmdar antagonist); and [(1s)-1-[[(7bromo-1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-2,3-dioxo-5-quinoxalinyl)methyl]amino]ethyl]phosphonic acid (cgp 78608; selective nmdar antagonist
that acts through the glycine site). the selective nr2b subunit antagonists ␣-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-␤-methyl-4-benzyl-1-piperidineethanol tartrate salt ( xxxd2326xxx ) and [r-(r*,s*)]-␣-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-␤methyl-4-(phenylmethyl)-1-piperidinepropanol hydrochloride (ro
25-6981) were purchased from sigma (st. louis, mo). the following
agents were purchased from calbiochem (san diego, ca). 2-[1-(3dimethylaminopropyl)-1h-indol-3-yl]-3-(1h-indol-3-yl)-maleimide
( xxxd2195xxx  i hcl; selective inhibitor of pkc␣, ␤i, ␤ii, ␧, ␦,
and ␨ isoforms), 12-(2-cyanoethyl)-6,7,12,13-tetrahydro-13-methyl-5oxo-5h-indolo(2,3-a)pyrrolo(3,4-c)-carbazole (go-7874; selective
inhibitor of pkc␣, ␤i, ␤ii, and ␥ isoforms), and myristoylated pki(14 –22)-amide [myr-n-gly-arg-thr-gly-arg-arg-asn-ala-ile-nh2;
selective pka inhibitor] as well as h-arg-gln-ile-lys-ile-trp-phegln-asn-arg-arg-met-lys-trp-lys-lys-leu-arg-lys-lys-lys-lyslys-his-oh (dt-3; selective pkg inhibitor). [(r)-[(s)-1-(4-bromophenyl)-ethylamino]-(2,3-dioxo-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroquinoxalin-5-yl)methyl]-phosphonic acid (nvp-aam077; selective  xxxg964xxx  subunit
antagonist) was a generous gift from novartis pharma (basel, switzerland). the drugs were dissolved in saline or mixture of 10%
 xxxd1896xxx  (sigma, st. louis, mo), 20% cremophor el
(sigma), and 70% saline. the appropriate drug vehicle was used as a
control.
nr2b shrna. the vector directing the transcription of a shrna
specifically targeting the nr2b ( xxxg965xxx ) subunit of the mouse
nmdar, as well as a shrna nonsilencing (ns) control vector, were
purchased from open biosystems (huntsville, al) as glycerol stocks
of transformed escherichia coli. the base vector for both plasmids is
a retroviral psm2. the psm2- xxxg965xxx  is designed for high-level expression of shrna for the mouse nr2b subunit under the control of

188

gabra et al.

the mouse u6 promoter. the psm2-ns represents a negative control
shrna vector. e. coli were grown according to the manufacturer’s
recommended protocols. the plasmids were gradient-purified using
cesium chloride (cscl). the sequence of the shrna insert in psm2grin2b was confirmed using a primer developed for the u6 promoter
region (5⬘-tgt gga aag gac gaa aca cc-3⬘). sequence analysis
was performed using an applied biosystems 377 prism xl automated dna sequencer (applied biosystems, foster city, ca) by the
massey cancer center nucleic acid synthesis and analysis core
resource (virginia commonwealth university, richmond, va).
arrest-in, a polymeric transfection reagent (open biosystems,
huntsville, al), was used for the highly efficient delivery of both
psm2- xxxg965xxx  and psm2-ns plasmids into neurons. once in the cells,
arrest-in promotes the entry of the shrna-containing plasmid into
the nucleus where it is transcribed into a hairpin, enters the cytoplasm, and is processed by the endogenous rna interference machinery into functional small interfering rnas.
intrathecal injections. intrathecal injections were made
through the intervertebral space in unanaesthetized mice between
the l5 and l6 of the spinal cord, as described by hylden and wilcox
(1980). in brief, a volume of 5 ␮l was administered i.t. with a
28-gauge 1/2-inch stainless steel needle connected to a 50-␮l hamilton microsyringe, the animal being lightly restrained to maintain the
position of the needle. puncture of the dura was indicated behaviorally by a slight flick of the tail.
the tail immersion test. the warm-water tail immersion test
was performed according to coderre and rollman (1983). the mouse
was gently wrapped in a towel, held at a 45° angle to a thermostatically controlled water bath set at 50 ⫾ 1°c. the latency between
submersion of the tail and its removal from the water by the animal
was recorded, with a maximal cut-off time of 10 s to avoid tissue
damage. pretreatment latencies were determined in mice, three
times with an interval of 24 h starting 3 days before drug administration, to obtain a stable predrug response (basal latency). mice
with a latency value between 5.0 and 7.0 s were used. the average
basal latency for the experiments was 5.7 ⫾ 0.01 s. the test latency
after drug administration was assessed at the appropriate time.
the tail immersion response was expressed as percentage of basal
latency.
immunoblotting. to examine changes in expression of nr2b
protein in the spinal cord, seven groups of mice (n ⫽ 6) were used for
immunoblot analysis: naive, three psm2-ns-treated groups (0.5, 1.0,
and 1.5 ␮g/mouse), and three psm2- xxxg965xxx -treated groups (0.5, 1.0,
and 1.5 ␮g/mouse). animals were euthanized by decapitation under
anesthesia (120 mg/kg i.p. pentobarbital). spinal cords were extracted by injecting normal saline under pressure through a 16gauge needle into the upper sacral spine, thus forcing the spinal cord
out rostrally. the l4–l6 dorsal spinal cord segments were rapidly
dissected and homogenized with a hand-held pellet pestle in 250 ␮l
of lysis buffer [20 mm tris, ph 7.5, 150 mm nacl, 1% nonidet p-40,
0.5% sodium  xxxd1835xxx , 1 mm edta, 0.1% sds, and complete
protease inhibitor cocktail from roche (indianapolis, in; 1 tablet/50
ml of lysis buffer)] and centrifuged at 13,000g for 3 min at 25°c. the
supernatant was decanted and used for the subsequent western blot
analyses. the protein concentration of the supernatant was measured using a pierce bicinchoninic acid protein assay kit (pierce,
norcross, ga). nr2b protein levels were determined using an immunoblotting procedure essentially as described previously (ritter et
al., 1999; guillemette et al., 2000). proteins were separated on a
7.5% sds-polyacrylamide gel (bio-rad; hercules, ca) and transferred to a nitrocellulose membranes (bio-rad, hercules, ca). membranes were blocked with superblock t-20 (tris-buffered saline)
blocking buffer (pierce) and incubated overnight at 4°c with rabbit
polyclonal antibody to nr2b (1:500 dilution; novus biologicals,
littleton, co). proteins were visualized by incubation with ecl plus
western blotting detection reagents (ge healthcare, piscataway,
nj) and scanned at 200-␮m resolution using the molecular dynamics storm system (ge healthcare). images were analyzed by using

imagequant software 5.2 (ge healthcare), and data were expressed
as volume of pixilation. because of the molecular weight disparity
between nr2b and ␤-actin, duplicate blots were prepared at the
same time and probed with a purified mouse monoclonal anti-␤actin, peroxidase (1:35,000 dilution; sigma), and visualized as described above and used as a loading control.
pharmacological treatments. in the first experiment, a doseresponse curve for (s)-3,5- xxxd2178xxx  (1.5–15 nmol/mouse) was performed  xxxd1891xxx -min intervals until 80 min after the drug administration. the following experiments then examined whether the
hyperalgesic effects of (s)-3,5- xxxd2178xxx  could be inhibited by pretreatment with various antagonists. mpep (12.5–50 nmol/mouse), 3-matida (0.5–5 nmol/mouse), cgs 19755 (0.01–5 pmol/mouse), cgp
78608 (1–100 pmol/mouse),  xxxd2326xxx  (0.5–2 nmol/mouse), ro 256981 (0.02–2 nmol/mouse), nvp-aam077 (0.005–10 nmol/mouse),
 xxxd2195xxx  i (1–100 pmol/mouse), go-7874 (0.25–2.5 nmol/
mouse), pki-(14 –22)-amide (0.025–2.5 nmol/mouse), or dt-3
(0.01–10 nmol/mouse) was administered 5 min before a 15 nmol/
mouse i.t. injection of (s)-3,5- xxxd2178xxx  (the dose that produced maximal hyperalgesia) and then reassessed for the tail immersion test 30
min later (time point that showed maximal hyperalgesia).
in another series of experiments, mice were administered arrest-in vehicle psm2-ns (0.5, 1.0, and 1.5 ␮g/mouse) or psm2- xxxg965xxx 
(0.5, 1.0, and 1.5 ␮g/mouse), 7 days before a 15 nmol/mouse i.t.
injection of (s)-3,5- xxxd2178xxx , and then reassessed for the tail immersion test 30 min later. spinal cords were then extracted for western
blot analyses. groups of 6 to 12 mice per dose per treatment were
tested for each compound following baseline determination (discussed in the section entitled “the tail immersion test”).

discussion
the present study addresses the coupling of the group i
mglurs to the nmdars in mediating thermal hyperalgesia
in mice. we showed that competitive nmdar antagonists
and glycine site nmdar antagonists blocked (s)-3,5-dhpginduced hyperalgesia. the link between mglur and nmdar
receptors was further strengthened by our data demonstrating for the first time that gene knockdown of the nr2b
subunit of the nmdar blocked the hyperalgesia as well. in
addition, the study addressed signal pathways involving
group i mglur-mediated pkc and pka activation of the

nmdar to express hyperalgesia in mice. these findings
suggest that mglur activation is key to initiating enhanced
nmda receptor responses. thus, the ionotropic function of
the nmdars in mediating thermal hyperalgesia in vivo is
subject to regulation that is initiated by mglurs/g-proteinlinked mechanisms.
antagonism of type i mglurs and nmdars blocks
the (s)-3,5- xxxd2178xxx -induced hyperalgesia. it is known
that activation of group i mglurs produces nocifensive behaviors in rats, although the mechanisms of these effects
were unclear. a number of studies have indicated a role for
group i mglurs in central sensitization and hyperalgesia
(fisher and coderre, 1996; neugebauer et al., 1999; karim et
al., 2001). in contrast, i.t. application of group ii and group
iii agonists did not produce nociceptive effects (fisher and
coderre, 1996); moreover, in a rat model of neuropathic pain,
they were shown to decrease mechanical and cold allodynia
(fisher et al., 2002). evidence thus far has suggested that
group i mglurs tend to be excitatory, whereas groups ii and
iii mglurs have an inhibitory role in the spinal cord dorsal
horn. in the present study, i.t. administration of the
 xxxg972xxx /5 agonist (s)-3,5- xxxd2178xxx  to mice resulted in significant hyperalgesia as assessed by the tail immersion test. the
pretreatment of mice with  xxxg972xxx  or  xxxg974xxx  antagonists
dose-dependently blocked the development of thermal hyperalgesia in mice. these antagonists given i.t. did not produce
an effect in control mice, suggesting a selective effect on
(s)-3,5- xxxd2178xxx -induced hyperalgesia. importantly, competitive antagonists of the nmdar or its glycine-binding site
significantly blocked group i mglur-mediated hyperalgesia,
suggesting that the coupling between mglur-nmdar facil-

itates ionotropic synaptic transmission and spinal desensitization.
nr2b gene knockdown blocks the (s)-3,5-dhpginduced hyperalgesia. the present study addresses the
coupling of the group i mglurs to the nmdars in mediating
thermal hyperalgesia in mice. competitive antagonism of the
nmdar or its glycine-binding site significantly blocked
group i mglur-mediated hyperalgesia we also demonstrated
for the first time that gene knockdown of the nr2b subunit
of the nmdar or pretreatment with a selective nr2b subunit antagonist blocked (s)-3,5- xxxd2178xxx -induced hyperalgesia.
these results demonstrate that nr2b subunits in the spinal
cord play an important role in maintaining functional
nmdars. in contrast, recent evidence indicates that nociceptive stimuli were more selective at increasing  xxxg964xxx  subunit phosphorylation in the brain rather than in the spinal
cord. in a model of inflammation, tyrosine-phosphorylation of
 xxxg964xxx  was up-regulated in the rostral ventromedial medulla
(turnbach et al., 2003), whereas it was unchanged at the
spinal level (guo et al., 2002). this could account for why the
 xxxg964xxx  subunit antagonist nvp-aam077 failed to significantly block (s)-3,5- xxxd2178xxx -induced hyperalgesia (fig. 3).
these findings suggest that the activation of mglurs is key
to initiating enhanced nmda receptor responses.
signal transductions mechanisms linking the type
i mglurs and the nmdars. the (s)-3,5- xxxd2178xxx -induced
hyperalgesia was blocked by pkc and pka, but not pkg
inhibitors, indicating that activation of mglur receptors
leads to increases in the activity of both pkc and pka.
 xxxg972xxx /5 receptors stimulate phospholipase c␤ through
gq/11 proteins to convert phosphatidylinositol bisphosphate
into diacylglycerol and ip3. diacylglycerol activates ca2⫹dependent (conventional) and independent (novel) pkc isoforms, which can phosphorylate serine/threonine sites on the
nmdar (sánchez-pérez and felipo, 2005). stimulation of
mglur receptors in rats with neuropathic pain leads to
nmdar-induced sensitization and increases in pkc activity. this effect was prevented by transient knockdown of
 xxxg972xxx  receptors with antisense (fundytus et al., 2001). in
addition, mglur stimulation could increase the activity of
pka through homer protein-linked stimulation of ip3 receptors (sala et al., 2005). the ca2⫹ that is released from ip3sensitive ca2⫹ pools is known to stimulate the ca2⫹-dependent isoforms of adenylyl cyclase. the finding that a selective
pkg inhibitor could not block the (s)-3,5- xxxd2178xxx -induced hyperalgesia confirms the lack of linkage between mglurs
stimulation and activation of the  xxxg1587xxx  pathway.
taken together, it could be suggested that the ionotropic
function of the nmdars in mediating thermal hyperalgesia
in vivo is subject to regulation that is initiated by mglurs/
g-protein-linked mechanisms.
protein structure linking mglurs to nmdars. the
spinal dorsal horn is the major site for initial nociceptive
processing. the results of our study confirm previous coimmunoprecipitation experiments, which suggested in the dorsal horn, that the mglur-homer-shank complex and
nmdar are biochemically linked through related postsynaptic density proteins such as  xxxg642xxx  and shank (guo et al.,
2004). the cytoskeletal elements and adaptor proteins that
make up the postsynaptic complex linking the mglur to the
nmdar also include protein kinases (tezuka et al., 1999;
lei et al., 2002; guo et al., 2004) that are important modu-

the role of nmda-nr2b subunit in mglur-induced hyperalgesia

lators of nmdar channels. accordingly, we suggested that
the nr2b subunit is phosphorylated by kinases intrinsic to
this protein complex. the present study show that the effects
of group i mglur agonists are coupled to nr2b phosphorylation and that this coupling requires pkc and pka, but not
pkg activation. the coupling of the mglurs to the nmdars
in dorsal horn neurons is supported by the fact that selective
mglur antagonists block inflammation-induced nr2b tyrosine-phosphorylation and selective mglur agonist-induced
nr2b tyrosine-phosphorylation in spinal slices (guo et al.,
2004). previous studies have shown that activation of group
i mglurs enhances nmda-induced currents (bond and
lodge, 1995) and the nmda-mediated increase in intracellular calcium concentration in dorsal horn neurons (bleakman et al., 1992). a role of the mglurs in central sensitization and persistent pain has been suggested previously
(morisset and nagy, 1996; neugebauer et al., 1999; karim et
al., 2001). in addition, it has been found that a coactivation of
hippocampal mglurs and nmdars is required for the induction of long-term potentiation (ltp) (fujii et al., 2004).
moreover, in mice lacking  xxxg974xxx , ltp was significantly
reduced in nmdar-dependent pathways, such as the ca1
region and dentate gyrus of the hippocampus. however, ltp
was not altered in the ca3 region, an nmdar-independent
pathway (lu et al., 1997).
nmdar-nr2b subunit provides a new target for
pain management. in summary, our results demonstrated
a coupling between the mglur and the nr2b subunit of the
nmdar in the spinal cord, and this coupling involved the
activation of pkc and pka mechanisms. ongoing projects in
our laboratory are targeting the structural proteins that link
mglurs and nmdars and their role in pain transmission in
acute and chronic animal pain models. these biochemical
events are correlated with the development of thermal hyperalgesia and may underlie the mechanisms of spinal sensitization. an important implication from the present study
is that mglurs facilitate ionotropic synaptic transmission as
a mechanism of modulation in the spinal cord. it is known
that phosphorylation of the nmdar results in an increase in
nmdar channel current and ca2⫹ influx through the
channel (wang and salter, 1994). thus, one functional
consequence of mglur activation under painful stimuli is
to prime nmdar for further enhanced hyperexcitability.
this mechanism may be a critical initiator for central
nociceptive sensitization.
