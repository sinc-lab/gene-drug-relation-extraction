d. ukena, c.g. schirren and u. schwabe, effects of  xxxd1999xxx  on a 1 and a , adenosine receptors, european
j. pharmacol. 117 (1985) 25-33.
the effects of  xxxd1999xxx  were studied on a 1 adenosine receptors of rat fat cells and on a 2 adenosine receptors of
human platelets and of guinea-pig lung.  xxxd1999xxx  antagonized the 5'-n-ethylcarboxamidoadenosine (neca)-induced stimulation of platelet adenylate cyclase activity with a k b of 130 ~tm. in human platelets,  xxxd1999xxx  did not
antagonize but potentiated the neca-induced inhibition of aggregation. this potentiation was abolished in the
presence of the phosphodiesterase inhibitor papaverine. an adenosine antagonistic effect of  xxxd1999xxx  could not be
evaluated on a 2 receptors of guinea-pig lung because the xanthine enhanced basal and neca-stimulated  xxxd1773xxx 
accumulation.  xxxd1999xxx  antagonized the n6-r-( - )-phenylisopropyladenosine (r-pia)-induced inhibition of rat fat
cell adenylate cyclase with a k b of 32 /~m. the k i value for inhibition of [3h]pia binding to fat cell membranes was
45/lm.  xxxd1999xxx  inhibited  xxxd1773xxx  phosphodiesterase activity of human platelets, guinea-pig lung and rat fat
cells with k i values of 15, 130 and 110/~m, respectively. the results show that  xxxd1999xxx  was nearly equipotent as
antagonist at a 1 and a 2 adenosine receptors. mechanisms other than adenosine antagonism or phosphodiesterase
inhibition may be involved in the pharmacological effects of  xxxd1999xxx .

1. introduction

xanthine derivatives with antiasthmatic effects
have been developed which differ from theophylline and caffeine in their profile of action. a m o n g
these c o m p o u n d s  xxxd1999xxx  ( xxxd1999xxx )
has been shown to be an effective bronchodilator
in animals and man, being about 5 times as potent
as theophylline (persson and kjellin, 1981; lunell
et al., 1982).  xxxd1999xxx  had no theophylline-like
diuretic effect or cns-stimulatory behavioural action in experimental animals (persson et al., 1982a).
it has been suggested that the differences in the
profile of action of  xxxd1999xxx  and theophylline
m a y reflect the involvement of adenosine (persson
et al., 1982a). theophylline is a potent adenosine
antagonist at therapeutic concentrations (for review see fredholm, 1980; daly, 1982), whereas

 xxxd1999xxx  seems to lack adenosine receptor
antagonistic properties (persson et al., 1982a). on
the other hand, fredholm and persson (1982) have
presented evidence that  xxxd1999xxx  is a more
potent antagonist at a z adenosine receptors which
mediate stimulation of adenylate cyclase activity,
than at the inhibitory a] adenosine receptors.
these authors suggested that  xxxd1999xxx  might
distinguish between adenosine receptor subtypes.
we therefore studied the effects of  xxxd1999xxx  on
adenosine receptors in several adenosine-sensitive
systems.

(boehringer mannheim); 4-(3-butoxy-4-methoxybenzyl)-2-imidazolidinone (ro 20-1724) was provided by dr. w.e. scott (hoffman-la roche,
nutley, n j, u.s.a.). all other reagents were from
standard commercial sources and were of analytical or the best available grade.

2.2. preparation of human platelet membranes
platelet membranes were prepared as described
by tsai and lefkowitz (1979). the protein concentration was determined according to the method
of lowry et al. (1951) using bovine  xxxg124xxx 
as standard.

2.3. preparation of guinea-pig lung slices
guinea-pigs (250-400 g) were killed by cervical
dislocation. the heart and the lungs were perfused
with 50 ml tris-saline buffer (10 mm tris-hc1,
ph 7.5, 0.154 m naci, 37°c, supplemented with

100 units sodium heparinate) to reduce contamination by blood cells. the lungs were removed and
freed from connective tissue and trachea. guineapig lung slices were prepared according to the
method described by stoner et al. (1974). the
lungs were chilled in ice-cold krebs-ringer bicarbonate-10 mm glucose (krbg) buffer, ph 7.4,
gassed with 95% 02-5% co2, and chopped into
1 × 0.1 × 0.1 mm slices using a mcllwain tissue
chopper (mickle lab. engin. co., gomshall, surrey, england). the slices were resuspended in
krbg buffer, ph 7.4, 37°c, and filtered through
nylon cloth. the supernatant was removed after
sedimentation and the slices were washed 3 times
with krbg buffer, ph 7.4. after the last washing
step the slices were resuspended in krbg buffer,
ph 7.4, and 0.2 ml portions of the slice suspension
were rapidly distributed into plastic vials prewarmed to 37°c.

2.4. preparation of rat fat cell membranes
isolated rat fat cells were prepared according to
the method of rodbell (1964). plasma membranes
were prepared as described by mckeel and jarett
(1979). after the last centrifugation step the membranes were resuspended in 50 mm tris-hc1, ph
7.4, frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at - 80°c.

2.5. adenvlate cyclase assay
adenylate cyclase activity of human platelet
membranes and of rat fat cell membranes was
determined as described previously (ukena et al.,
1984). the assay medium contained 0.1 mm [c~32p]atp (0.5-0.75/~ci/tube), 1 mm mgc12, 1 ~m
gtp, 0.1 mm  xxxd1773xxx , 0.5 mm ro 20-1724,
0.2 mm ethyleneglycol-bis-(fl-aminoethylether)n,n'-tetraacetic acid (egta), 5 mm creatine
phosphate as tris salt, 0.4 m g / m l creatine kinase,
2 m g / m l bovine  xxxg124xxx  and 50 mm trishci, ph 7.4, in a total volume of 100 ~1. in the
case of fat cell membranes,  xxxg62xxx 
(1 # g / m l ) and 150 mm  xxxg2020xxx  were included in the
assay. incubations (10 min at 37°c) were initiated
by the addition of fat cell membranes (approximately 15 /~g protein/tube) or human platelet
membranes (approximately 20-30/,g protein/tube)

27
to reaction mixtures that had been preincubated
for 5 min at 37°c. reactions were stopped by the
addition of zinc acetate and na2co 3.

2.6. platelet aggregation
human platelet-rich plasma was separated from
citrated venous blood by centrifugation at 260 × g
for 20 min at room temperature. platelet aggregation was measured as described previously (ukena
et al., 1984). incubation mixtures consisting of 210
~1 platelet-rich plasma (platelet count about
300000//~1) and additions of 5'-n-ethylcarboxamidoadenosine (neca) and xanthine derivatives
in 0.154 m  xxxg2020xxx  were stirred in a final volume of
250 ~tl at 37°c in an aggregometer (elvi 840, elvi,
milano, italy). after preincubation for 3 min,
platelet aggregation was initiated by adding 5 ~m
adp and was recorded for 5 min.

2.7. assay of  xxxd1773xxx 
lung slices (about 50-100 ~g protein/tube) were
incubated at 37°c in a total volume of 1 ml of
k r b g buffer, ph 7.4, gassed with 95% 02/5%
co 2 and shaken at 120 cycles/min. after 10 min
preincubation the phosphodiesterase inhibitor
 xxxd3142xxx  (30 i~m) was added 5 min prior to the
addition of other agents. incubation was carried
out for 15 rain at 37°c. all assays were done in
triplicate. the incubation was terminated by transferring the lung slice suspension into an eppendorf tube containing 200 ~1 ice-cold perchloric
acid (3.9 m). the  xxxd1773xxx  concentration was
determined by a radioimmunoassay according to
harper and brooker (1975). the protein content in
the perchloric acid precipitate was determined as
described above after the pellet had been dissolved
in 5%  xxxd3215xxx  (in 1 m naoh) and
heated for 5 rain at 95°c.

2.8. radioligand binding
the measurement of [3h]pia binding to rat fat
cell membranes was carried out as described previously (ukena et al., 1984). the assay contained 1
nm [3h]pia, 1 ~ g / m l  xxxg62xxx , 50
mm tris-hc1, ph 7.4, and 20-30/~g fat cell membrane protein in a final volume of 250 ~1. other

substances were added as indicated. incubation
was carried out at 37°c for 90 min and was
terminated by rapid filtration of an aliquot of 200
~1 through a whatman g f / b glass fibre filter.
the filter was immediately washed with two 3 ml
portions of ice-cold incubation buffer. specific
binding was defined as the amount of radioligand
bound in the absence of competing drugs minus
the amount bound in the presence of 10 ~m
n6-r-( - )-phenylisopropyladenosine (r-pia).

2.9. phosphodiesterase assay
phosphodiesterase activity of human platelets,
guinea-pig lung and rat fat cells was determined as
described by bauer and schwabe (1980). after the
last washing step tissues were homogenized in 10
volumes of 10 mm tris-hc1, ph 7.4, using a
polytron homogenizer (20 s setting 6). the homogenates were centrifuged at 100000 × g for 30 min
and aliquots of the supernatants were stored at
- 7 0 ° c until use. in the case of fat cells, aliquots
of the infranatant solution were used. under
standard conditions the assay mixture for measurement of phosphodiesterase activity contained
40 mm tris-hc1, ph 8.0, 5 mm mgci z, 1 ~m
cyclic [3h]amp (20-30000 cpm) and 5-15 ~g of
enzyme (diluted in 0.1% bovine  xxxg124xxx ) in
a total volume of 200 /~1. incubations (10 rain at
30°c) were initiated by the addition of enzyme
solution to reaction mixtures that had been preincubated for 3 min at 30°c. the reaction was
terminated by transferring the tubes to a thermoblock preheated at 95°c for 3 min followed by
immediate cooling in an ice-cold aluminium block.
following re-equilibration to 30°c, 50 ~1 of
crotalus atrox snake venom (1 m g / m l ) was added.
after 10 min incubation at 30°c the reaction was
terminated by applying a 0.2 ml aliquot to the
qae a-25 sephadex column ( 6 x 15 mm in
pasteur pipettes) followed by 2 ml 30 mm ammonium formate, ph 6.0. the effluent was collected and the radioactivity counted in a liquid
scintillation counter.

2.10. data analysis
ecs0 and ics0 values were obtained from concentration-response curves by linear regression

28
analysis after logit-log transformation. k b values
for competitive antagonism were calculated by
linear regression from schild plots. in other cases,
k b values were calculated by using the schild
equation k b = c/(cr-1), where c denotes the
concentration of competitor and cr the ratio of
the ics0 values in the presence and absence of the
competitor. equilibrium binding data were
analyzed by non-linear curve fitting with the aid of
the program sctfit (de lean et al., 1982).

neca was used to determine the potency of
 xxxd1999xxx  at a 2 receptors of human platelets. in
these cells, n e c a has been shown to be a potent
agonist at a 2 receptors which mediate the inhibition of aggregation via activation of adenylate
cyclase (cusack and hourani, 1981). figure 1
shows the concentration-response curve for the
effect of n e c a on platelet adenylate cyclase.
n e c a stimulated adenylate cyclase activity approximately 6-fold over basal values with an ecs0
of 0.27/~m.  xxxd1999xxx  alone did not affect basal
enzyme activity but shifted the concentration-response curve of the agonist to the right without
changing the slope or the degree of stimulation by
neca. this favours competitive antagonism.
thus, the ecso values of n e c a were 0.46 and 2.2
~m in the presence of 100 and 1000 ~m  xxxd1999xxx , respectively. the dissociation constant k b for
 xxxd1999xxx  calculated from the schild plot of
these data was 130 /zm as shown in the lower
panel of fig. 1. the slope of the line is near unity
confirming the competitive antagonism between
n eca and  xxxd1999xxx . for comparison, we have
also evaluated the a 2 receptor antagonism of
theophylline. the ecso values of n e c a for stimulation of adenylate cyclase were 0.29, 0.48 and 2.0
~m in the presence of 1, 10 and 100/zm theophylline, respectively. from these data we calculated a
k b of 14.1 ~m for theophylline.
in experiments on the effects of  xxxd1999xxx  on
the neca-induced inhibition of platelet aggregation, n e c a inhibited adp-induced aggregation

concentrations which alone produced only a

ic50 for neca. thus, the ic50 values of neca
were 0.09 and 0.06/~m in the presence of 100 and

theophylline antagonized the neca effect on aggregation (table 1) in a concentration-dependent

was 9.6/xm.

markedly potentiated the inhibitory effect of
neca on aggregation as indicated by a decrease
of the ics0 of neca from 0.46 to 0.031 ~tm (table
1). under these conditions,  xxxd1999xxx  did not
significantly affect the neca-induced inhibition
of aggregation. theophylline again competitively
antagonized the effect of neca on aggregation.
in the presence of papaverine, the k b of theophylline calculated from a schild plot of the data in
table 1 was 7.2 ~tm which agrees closely with that
determined in the absence of the phosphodiesterase inhibitor.
there is recent evidence for adenylate cyclasecoupled a 2 adenosine receptors in guinea-pig lung
(ukena and schirren, 1985). figure 3 shows the
effects of theophylline and  xxxd1999xxx  on basal
and neca-stimulated  xxxd1773xxx  formation in
guinea-pig lung slices. theophylline (1 mm) did
not affect basal values but reversed the neca-induced increase in  xxxd1773xxx  levels. theophylline
inhibited the neca-stimulated  xxxd1773xxx  formation with a k~ of 8.1 ~tm (ukena and schirren,
1985).  xxxd1999xxx  (1 mm) increased basal cyclic
amp levels by about 65%. in the presence of 0.5
>m neca  xxxd1999xxx  further enhanced cyclic
amp accumulation. therefore, an adenosine antagonistic effect of  xxxd1999xxx  could not be detected in the  xxxd1773xxx  studies.
3.2. a 1 adenosine receptors

r-pia was used to determine the potency of
 xxxd1999xxx  at a 1 receptors of rat fat cells. r-pia
has been characterized as a potent a 1 receptor
agonist for inhibition of adenylate cyclase, lipolysis and radioligand binding in fat cells (londos et
al., 1978; 1980; trost and schwabe, 1981). as
shown in fig. 4, the basal adenylate cyclase activity
of rat fat cell membranes was inhibited by r-pia
with an ics0 of 26 nm.  xxxd1999xxx  did not affect
the basal activity in the absence of r-pia, but
produced a parallel rightward shift of the concentration-response curve without a change of
slope or maximal effect. the ics0 of r-pia in the
presence of 100/~m  xxxd1999xxx  was 107 nm. the
k b of  xxxd1999xxx  calculated from the schild
equation was 32 /.tm. for comparison, the ic50 of
r-pia for inhibition of fat cell adenylate cyclase

[3h]pia binding with a k i of 45 /tm and" was
therefore about 6-fold less potent than theophyiline which had a k, of 7.4 # m (table 2). furthermore, these k i values for inhibition of [3h]pia
binding are in good agreement with the kb values
for antagonism of r-pia-induced inhibition of fat
cell adenylate cyclase.

3. 3. phosphodiesterase activity
the last series of experiments concerned the
inhibition of phosphodiesterase activity by  xxxd1999xxx  and theophylline.  xxxd1999xxx  inhibited
cyclic a m p phosphodiesterase activity of human
platelets with a k i of 15 # m and was therefore
6-fold more potent than theophylline (table 3).
the k i values of  xxxd1999xxx  for inhibition of
phosphodiesterase activity in guinea-pig lung and
rat fat cells were approximately 8-fold higher than
those determined in platelets. again,  xxxd1999xxx 
was more potent than theophylline as inhibitor of
phosphodiesterases in lung and fat cells. the k~
values of theophylline for inhibition of phosphodiesterase activity were much higher than those
determined for inhibition of a 1 and a 2 adenosine
receptor-mediated responses, thus confirming the
higher affinity of theophylline for adenosine receptors compared to that for phosphodiesterases.

4. discussion
 xxxd1999xxx  has been described as a novel type
of an antiasthmatic xanthine which exhibits a high
degree of lung selectivity compared to theophylline
(persson et al., 1982a).  xxxd1999xxx  is about 5
times more potent than theophylline as bronchodilator in vitro and in vivo in experimental animals
and in man (persson and kjellin, 1981; lunell et
al., 1982). both  xxxd1999xxx  and theophylline may
inhibit the development of airway and pulmonary
edema in guinea-pigs exposed to histamine aerosol
(persson, 1982). it has further been shown that
 xxxd1999xxx  was about 3 times more potent than
theophylline in stimulating the rate and force of
cardiac contraction (persson and andersson, 1977).
 xxxd1999xxx  was found to be devoid of theophylline-like effects on cns measured as locomotor
stimulation and convulsions, respectively (persson
and kjellin, 1981). finally, in contrast to theophylline,  xxxd1999xxx  did not produce significant
natriuretic and diuretic effects (persson et al.,
1982a). this different profile of action of the two
xanthines has been explained by different actions
at the cellular level. in low concentrations theophylline is a potent competitive antagonist at
adenosine receptors. this mechanism has been
proposed to be involved in several effects of theophyllme including bronchodilation, diuresis and
cns stimulation (fredholm, 1980; daly, 1982). in
contrast,  xxxd1999xxx  has been described as a
xanthine derivative without adenosine antagonistic
properties (persson et al., 1982a,b).
our results demonstrate clearly that  xxxd1999xxx  is an antagonist at a 1 and a 2 adenosine
receptors. it competitively antagonized both a1
and a 2 receptor-mediated effects on adenylate
cyclase. the k b values of  xxxd1999xxx  at a 2
adenosine receptors of human platelets and at a~
adenosine receptors of rat fat cells were in the
same concentration range. the k s values from the
adenylate cyclase studies are in good agreement
with the k i value for inhibition of [3h]pia
binding to a 1 adenosine receptors of fat cell membranes. nearly identical k i values were obtained
for inhibition of radioligand binding to a 1 adenosine receptors of cerebral cortex membranes
(schwabe et al., 1985). our results differ from

32
those published by fredholm and persson (1982).
they found that  xxxd1999xxx  inhibited n e c a - i n duced cyclic a m p accumulation in rat hippocampal slices with a k i of about 5/~m c o m p a r e d
to a k~ of about 100 ~ m for inhibition of [3h]pia
binding to a~ receptors of rat cerebral cortex
membranes. f r e d h o l m and persson (1982) suggested that  xxxd1999xxx  might be a subtype-selective antagonist at a 2 adenosine receptors. using
subtype-selective cells, we found that  xxxd1999xxx 
was nearly equipotent as antagonist at a 1 and a 2
adenosine receptors.
however, the results obtained with h u m a n
platelets and guinea-pig lung slices indicate that
 xxxd1999xxx  may have additional effects b e y o n d
adenosine antagonism.  xxxd1999xxx  increased the
antiaggregatory p o t e n c y of n e c a . a similar observation was reported by vinge et al. (1984). the
potentiating effect of  xxxd1999xxx  on n e c a - i n duced inhibition of platelet aggregation was
abolished in the presence of the phospl]odiesterase
inhibitor papaverine. in contrast, the k b values of
theophylline for inhibition of the n e c a effect
were nearly the same in the absence and presence
of papaverine. similar results were obtained in the
cyclic a m p studies with guinea-pig lung slices. an
adenosine antagonistic effect of  xxxd1999xxx  in
lung slices could not be evaluated, because it enhanced both basal and n e c a - s t i m u l a t e d cyclic
a m p formation. theophylline inhibited n e c a stimulated cyclic a m p formation with a k~ of 8
/~m.
the effects of  xxxd1999xxx  on platelet aggregation and cyclic a m p formation in lung tissue
could indicate that it acts via inhibition of phosphodiesterases. indeed,  xxxd1999xxx  inhibited
cyclic a m p phosphodiesterase activity of h u m a n
platelets and of guinea-pig lung with k i values of
15 and 130 /~m. the data for lung tissue agree
reasonably well with those obtained by bergstrand
(1985) who studied the effects of  xxxd1999xxx  on
three distinct cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterases
from h u m a n lung. the xanthine inhibited cyclic
nucleotide phosphodiesterase (f ii) and the relatively specific cyclic a m p phosphodiesterase (f
iii) with k~ values of 330 and 60 ~m, respectively.
the corresponding k~ values of theophylline were
240 and 90 /~m (bergstrand, 1985). however, as

previously described for theophylline (poison et
al., 1978; fredholm, 1980), these k~ values are
much higher than the therapeutic plasma concentrations of  xxxd1999xxx  which are in the range
of 5 to 25 t~m (vinge et al., 1984). despite its
attractiveness as a possibility, adenosine antagonism or phosphodiesterase inhibition may not be
the relevant mechanisms in the action of  xxxd1999xxx . it seems, therefore, that further studies are
warranted if the antiasthmatic effects of  xxxd1999xxx  are to be explained.
