1 we have previously demonstrated that contractions of rat vas deferens to exogenous noradrenaline
involve predominantly a1a-adrenoceptors, but that contractions to endogenous noradrenaline involve
predominantly a1d-adrenoceptors. in this study, we have examined the effects of sympathectomy on
the subtypes of a1-adrenoceptor in rat vas deferens in radioligand binding and functional studies.
2 in vehicle-treated tissues, antagonist displacement of [3h] xxxd3000xxx  binding to a1-adrenoceptors
was consistent with a single population of a1-adrenoceptors. binding affinities for a range of a1adrenoceptor antagonists were expressed as pki values and correlated with known affinities for a1adrenoceptor subtypes. the correlation was significant only with a1a-adrenoceptors.
3 in tissues from rats sympathectomised with 6-hydroxy-dopamine (2  100 mg kg1 i.p.), binding
affinity for the a1d-adrenoceptor antagonist bmy 7378 fitted best with a two-site model.
4 in functional studies, the potency of noradrenaline at producing total (phasic plus tonic) but not
tonic contractions was increased in tissues from sympathectomised rats.
5 results obtained from sympathectomised rats suggest that phasic contractions are mainly a1dadrenoceptor mediated, whereas tonic contractions are mainly a1a-adrenoceptor mediated, based on
the effects of bmy 7378 and the a1a-adrenoceptor antagonist rs 100329.
6 it is concluded that the predominant a1-adrenoceptor in vehicle-treated rat vas deferens is the a1aadrenoceptor, both in terms of ligand binding and contractions to exogenous agonists. the a1dadrenoceptor is only detectable by ligand binding following chemical sympathectomy, but is involved
in noradrenaline-evoked contractions, particularly phasic contractions, of rat vas deferens.

introduction
a1-adrenoceptors were initially subdivided into a1a- and a1bsubtypes in ligand binding studies (morrow & creese, 1986;
han et al., 1987). molecular cloning techniques revealed
initially four subtypes of a1-adrenoceptor: a1a, a1b, a1c and a1d
(cotecchia et al., 1988; schwinn et al., 1990; lomasney et al.,
1991; perez et al., 1991). the a1a/a1d clone represented a novel
subtype of a1-adrenoceptor (a1d), whereas the a1c is now
identified with the a1a-ligand binding site. these clones have
now been renamed to match the functional receptors: a1a
(formerly a1c), a1b (formerly a1b), and a1d (formerly a1a/a1d)
(heible et al., 1995). selective agonists such as a61603 are
available for a1a-adrenoceptors, with selective antagonists
such as rs 100329 for a1a-adrenoceptors, and bmy 7378 for
a1d-adrenoceptors (see docherty, 1998; guimares & moura,
2001).
it has been variously suggested that contractions of rat vas
deferens to exogenous noradrenaline or adrenaline are
mediated predominantly by a1a-adrenoceptors (han et al.,
1987; hanft & gross, 1989; aboud et al., 1993), or the

postulated a1l-adrenoceptor in addition to a1a-adrenoceptors
(ohmura et al., 1992). in a previous study of rat vas deferens,
we found that contractions to exogenous noradrenaline were
mediated predominantly by a1a-adrenoceptors, and contractions to endogenous noradrenaline by a1d-adrenoceptors
(honner & docherty, 1999). in this study, we have examined
the subtypes of a1-adrenoceptor present in rat vas deferens in
normal rat and how these are changed following sympathectomy. some of these results have been published in abstract
form (slattery et al., 2003).

methods
male wistar rats (250–350 g) were obtained from trinity
college dublin, and vas deferens was employed as outlined
below. some animals were injected with 6-hydroxy-dopamine
(100 mg kg1 i.p.) on days 1 and 4 to produce a chemical
sympathectomy, or with vehicle. tissues were investigated on
day 5 or 6. animals were killed by co2 overdose. the studies
were carried out in accordance with the declaration of

746

l. cleary et al

helsinki and have been approved by the department of health
and by the rcsi research ethics committee.

rat vas deferens: membrane preparation
membrane radioligand binding was performed using a method
adapted from those of cheung et al. (1982), neylon &
summers (1985), michel et al. (1989) and connaughton &
docherty (1990). the vasa deferentia were removed and
carefully cleaned of any adherent connective tissue. they were
then weighed and chopped finely using small sharp scissors.
the tissue was diluted in 10 volumes of ice-cold initial wash
buffer (tris-hcl 50 mm, edta 5 mm: ph 7.4 at 41c). the
soluble components of the tissue were removed by a series
of homogenisation and centrifugation steps. the tissue was
homogenised in an ultra-turrax homogeniser for 30 s and
centrifuged using an eppendorf micro-centrifuge 5415c at
16,000  g for 12 min at 41c. following this, the supernatant
was discarded and the pellet fraction was resuspended in 10
volumes of ice-cold initial wash buffer. the homogenisation
and centrifugation steps were repeated. the supernatant was
again discarded and the pellet suspended in 10 volumes of icecold incubation buffer (tris-hcl 50 mm, edta 5 mm: ph 7.4
at 251c) and homogenised again. the homogenate was filtered
through two layers of nylon 43 t-mesh gauze to remove
connective tissue. prepared membranes were used immediately
in the radioligand binding assays.

competition radioligand binding
competition binding assays were carried out in duplicate in
5 ml polypropylene test tubes. a measure of 100 ml membrane
aliquots were incubated with 100 ml of radioligand ([3h] xxxd3000xxx , 2 nm) and 100 ml of unlabelled ligand, incubation buffer or
 xxxd2914xxx  (10 mm). assays were performed at 251c for
30 min.
specific binding was determined by subtracting the radioligand binding to nonspecific sites from the total radioligand
binding for all sites. nonspecific binding was determined in the
presence of 10 mm  xxxd2914xxx .
following the 30-min incubation period, bound and free
radioligand were separated by vacuum filtration. the assays
were terminated by the addition of 5-ml ice-cold wash buffer
(tris-hcl 50 mm, edta 5 mm: ph 7.4 at 41c) to all tubes.
this was followed by rapid filtration through whatman gf/c
glass fibre filters using a brandell call harvester. filters and
tubes were then washed four times with 5 ml of ice-cold wash
buffer.
each filter was placed in a standard polypropylene
scintillation vial and 5 ml of organic liquid scintillation
medium (pico-fluor 40, packard) was added to each vial.
the vials were placed on a shaker for 20 min before counting
on a lkb 1214 rack beta counter.

saturation radioligand binding
saturation binding experiments were carried out as described
above for competition studies, but employing increasing
concentrations of [3h] xxxd3000xxx  (70–87 ci mmol1, new england nuclear) (0.1–20 nm).  xxxd3000xxx  kd was 0.3370.12 nm
(n ¼ 6) and bmax was 7407155 fmol mg1 protein in vehicletreated tissues.

vas deferens a1-adrenoceptor subtypes

rat vas deferens: contractile studies
rats were killed by co2 overdose, and whole vas deferens was
dissected out. tissues were placed between platinum electrodes
and attached to myograph transducers, orientated with the
epididymal portion uppermost, under 1.0 g tension in organ
baths at 371c in krebs–henseleit solution of the following
composition: (mm): nacl 119; nahco3 25; d-glucose 11.1;
kcl 4.7; cacl2 2.5; kh2po4 1.2;  xxxd2534xxx  1.0. the solution was
bubbled with 5%co2/95%o2. cocaine (3 mm) was additionally
present prior to and during noradrenaline concentration–
response curves. data acquisition was carried out using a
maclab system.

contractile responses to electrical stimulation
and to exogenous agonists
tissues were equilibrated for 30 min then stimulated with a
single pulse, followed 5 min later by 40 pulses  xxxd1891xxx  hz
(supramaximal voltage, 0.5 ms duration. tissues were then
contracted with noradrenaline (10 mm). cocaine was then
added and bathing fluid was changed every 15 min for the next
hour. following 45 min exposure to bmy 7378 (0.3 mm) or rs
100329 (0.03 mm) or vehicle, a single noradrenaline concentration–response curve was obtained per tissue. tissues were
contracted with noradrenaline cumulatively in 1.0 log unit
increments at approximately 2-min intervals beginning with
100 nm. responses to noradrenaline consisted of phasic and
tonic contractions. phasic contractions were measured as the
total contraction (phasic plus tonic) and called total contraction. tonic contractions were measured as the underlying
baseline on which phasic contractions were superimposed.
these tonic contractions were more difficult to measure in
tissues from sympathectomised animals due to the high level of
phasic contractions.

drugs were dissolved in distilled water, except for 6hydroxy-dopamine ( xxxd228xxx  1 mg ml1), spiperone
(100% ethanol), and rs 17053 (dmso), and dilutions were
made up in distilled water.

statistics
values are mean7s.e.m. from n experiments. statistical and
graphical analysis was carried out using instat for macintosh
and graphpad prism for pc. antagonist ki values were
obtained from the equation ki ¼ ic50/(1 þ [3h]/kd), where ki is
the ligand affinity constant, ic50 is the concentration of ligand
that produces 50% displacement of binding, [3h] is the
concentration of radioligand employed (2 nm) and kd is the
equilibrium dissociation constant for [3h] xxxd3000xxx  (0.33 nm).
correlations were made between functional antagonist potency and pooled binding affinity data from a number of
studies. two- and one-site models of ligand binding were
compared by an f test based on increase in sum of squares
divided by increase in degrees of freedom in going from two
site to one. hill slopes were considered significantly different
from 1 when 95% confidence limits did not include 1.0.

results
in vehicle-treated rats, displacement of [3h] xxxd3000xxx  binding
to membranes of rat vas deferens fitted best with a one-site
model for all 10 antagonists investigated, with hill slopes not
significantly different from 1, although hill slopes were
relatively low for several ligands including the a1a-adrenoceptor selective antagonists rs 17053 and rs 100329 and the a1dadrenoceptor selective antagonist bmy 7378 (table 1).
in sympathectomised tissues, binding affinity for the a1dadrenoceptor selective antagonist bmy 7378 fitted best with a
two-site model (significant in five from five individual
experiments and for all data combined), with pki values of
9.5970.30 (46710% of specific binding) and 7.1870.14 for
high- and low-affinity sites respectively (n ¼ 5) (values quoted
are the means from individual experiments and differ from
those in table 1). for the a1a-adrenoceptor selective antago-

model in individual experiments (two-site model was best in
only one from seven experiments), although the hill slopes for
both bmy 7378 and rs 100329 were significantly different
from 1 (table 1).
for bmy 7378, all data points obtained in five to six
separate experiments for both vehicle-treated (n ¼ 6) and
sympathectomised (n ¼ 5) tissues are shown in figure 1. from
these data, a ki value for bmy 7378 of 7.1070.12 was
obtained for a one-site model in vehicle-treated tissue, and
high- and low-affinity pki values of 9.2070.24 (42% of
specific binding) and 7.1770.14 were obtained for a two-site
model in sympathectomised tissues. these affinities closely
fit the published affinities of bmy 7378 for a1d- and a1aadrenoceptors, respectively, and were used for calculation of
correlations in table 2.
correlation analysis between ligand affinities for a1-adrenoceptors in rat vas deferens (table 1) and published data for
their affinities at subtypes of a1 was carried out (table 2).
correlation of rat vas deferens binding using the low-affinity
site for bmy 7378 was significant only with the a1aadrenoceptor (r ¼ 0.78, po0.01), and was poor with the a1badrenoceptor (r ¼ 0.47, ns) and the a1d-adrenoceptor
(r ¼ 0.57, ns). if the value of bmy 7378 at the high-affinity
sites obtained in sympathectomised rats were used in correlations with a1a- and a1d-adrenoceptors, respectively, the

in terms of time to maximum response and time from end of

noradrenaline produced contractions of rat vas deferens
consisting of phasic and tonic components (figures 2 and 3),
but the relative importance of the phasic response was greater
in tissues from sympathectomised animals, so that responses
were analysed as total response (phasic and tonic combined)
and tonic (maintained) response (figures 4 and 5).
in control experiments (in the absence of receptor antagonists), there were no significant differences between vehicletreated and sympathectomised rats in the maximum total or
tonic responses to noradrenaline (figures 4 and 5). there was
no difference between vehicle-treated and sympathectomised
animals in the potency of noradrenaline in producing tonic
contractions (figure 5). however, noradrenaline was significantly more potent at producing phasic contractions in tissues
from sympathectomised animals (figure 4 and table 3).
the total contraction to noradrenaline was unaffected by
rs 100329 (0.03 mm) in tissues from sympathectomised rats
(figures 3 and 4 and table 3), whereas this concentration of
rs 100329 produced a very marked shift in the total
contaction to noradrenaiine in tissues from vehicle-treated
animals (figures 3 and 4 and table 3). rs 100329 produced

bmy 7378 is altered by sympathectomy in rat vas deferens.

firstly, sympathectomy using the current protocol was not
complete in that some response to nerve stimulation remained.
despite this, there were marked changes in ligand binding and
in responses to exogenous noradrenaline.
bmy 7378 is especially interesting as an a1d-adrenoceptor
selective antagonist (goetz et al., 1995) that has high potency
as an antagonist in rat aorta, but low potency in vas deferens
(deng et al., 1996). in a previous study, taking the published
data for a1-adrenoceptor ligand binding sites, we correlated
with contractile data and found that the predominant receptor

mediating contractions to exogenous noradrenaline in rat vas
deferens was an a1a-adrenoceptor (honner & docherty, 1999),
in agreement with previous findings (teng et al., 1994; burt
et al., 1995). for responses to endogenous noradrenaline
(nerve-mediated responses) in rat vas deferens, there was a
significant correlation only with a1d-adrenoceptors (honner
& docherty, 1999), in agreement with evidence for expression
of a1d-adrenoceptors in rat vas deferens (perez et al., 1991;
rokosh et al., 1994).
in the present study, we initially investigated whether these
two subtypes of a1-adrenoceptor can be identified in ligand
binding studies of rat vas deferens. in vehicle-treated tissues,
antagonist binding was consistent with a single population of
a1-adrenoceptors, with hill slopes not significantly different
from unity. binding affinities for a range of a1-adrenoceptor
antagonists were expressed as pki values and correlated with
known affinities for a1-adrenoceptors. there was a significant
correlation with published data for ligand binding affinities
at a1a-adrenoceptors but not at a1b- or a1d-adrenoceptors.
furthermore, the pki values obtained in the present study
correlated significantly with the potency of antagonists
at inhibiting contractions to exogenous noradrenaline (an
a1a-adrenoceptor mediated response: r ¼ 0.81, po0.01), but
not with the potency of antagonists at inhibiting the
nifedipine-insensitive a1-adrenoceptor mediated electrically
evoked contraction (a1d-adrenoceptor mediated; r ¼ 0.49,
ns) (functional data taken from honner & docherty, 1999).
hence, in vas deferens from vehicle-treated rats, ligand binding
reveals only the predominant a1a-adrenoceptor involved in
contractions to exogenous noradrenaline, which is presumably
located widely on the smooth muscle cells. the a1d-adrenoceptor involved in nerve-stimulation evoked contractions is
presumably localised to areas postjunctional to nerve terminals, and, although making a major contribution to contractile responses to endogenous noradrenaline, is relatively
unimportant in terms of receptor number. we next hypothesised that it might be possible to identify these a1dadrenoceptors following chemical sympathectomy, which
should result in denervation supersensitivity. hence, experibritish journal of pharmacology vol 143 (6)

vas deferens a1-adrenoceptor subtypes

ments were carried out employing 6-hydroxy-dopamine to
cause chemical sympathectomy (thoenen & tranzer, 1968).
following chemical sympathectomy, binding of bmy 7378
to rat vas deferens membranes fitted best with a two-site
model, yielding affinities which fitted with its known affinity
for a1d-adrenoceptors (high-affinity site) and with a1a- or a1badrenoceptors (low-affinity site). however, since the predominant site in untreated rat vas deferens is an a1a-adrenoceptor,
it can be assumed that the low-affinity site in sympathectomised tissue is an a1a-adrenoceptor. for the a1a-adrenoceptor
selective antagonist rs 100329, binding to vas deferens from
sympathectomised rats fitted best with a one-site model,
although the hill slope was significantly less than 1 (0.64), a
two-site model was best in one experiment and the affinity
value (8.43) was significantly lower that that in untreated
vessels (9.61), but still higher than its affinity for a1b- or a1dadrenoceptors. this may suggest that the presence of an
increased number of a1d-adrenoceptors affected the affinity of
rs 100329, but not enough to produce a two-site model.
presumably, since bmy 7378 shows 300-fold selectivity for a1d
over a1a but rs 100329 shows only 30-fold selectivity for a1a
over a1d (see table 2), a two-site model is more easy to obtain
with bmy 7378.
it has long been known that, following chemical or surgical
denervation of adrenergic nerves, a postjunctional supersensitivity to agonists occurs. part of the supersensitivity to
exogenous noradrenaline is prejunctional by loss of nerve
terminals, and so loss of noradrenaline re-uptake, similar to a
cocaine supersensitivity (trendelenburg, 1966; iversen, 1967).
a postjunctional component has also been postulated.
reserpine increases the potency of phenylephrine (nasseri
et al., 1985), and surgical denervation increases the potency of
noradrenaline (campos et al., 2003) in rat vas deferens
surgical or chemical sympathectomy produces supersensitivity
in other tissues (amark & olson, 1992; chou et al., 2001). the
enhanced contractile response of rat vas deferens to noradrenaline following surgical denervation has been linked to
protein kinase c and to decreased involvement of nifedipinesensitive calcium entry (abraham et al., 2003). in our
neurotransmission studies, the a1d-adrenoceptor mediated
contaction of rat vas deferens is indeed insensitive to
nifedipine (honner & docherty, 1999), suggesting that the
changes seen by abraham et al. (2003) may involve
a1d-adrenoceptors.
in terms of receptor number, the number of a1d-adrenoceptors increases from undetectable in vehicle-treated tissue (say,
less than 10%) to 46% in sympathectomised tissues. we did
not look at maximum number of binding sites in sympathectomised tissues (given the large variation in bmax values
obtained in vehicle-treated tissues, we would only have been
able to detect large changes in bmax), so that we cannot say
whether this represents an increase in total number of
receptors or substitution of a1d for a1a. previous studies of
the effects of chemical sympathectomy in rat or guinea-pig vas
deferens with 6-hydroxydopamine or reserpine reported no
change in a1-adrenoceptor density (watanabe et al., 1982;
cowan et al., 1985; nasseri et al., 1985). if there is no increase
in receptor number following chemical sympathectomy, then
supersensitivity to agonists must be due to change in receptor
subtype. indeed, noradrenaline and phenylephrine are more
potent in rat aorta (a1d) than in rat mesenteric artery (a1a) (e.g.
from our group: cawley et al., 1995; connolly et al., 1999), so

l. cleary et al

that it is likely that such a change in receptor subtype would
result in supersensitivity to agonists.
the second part of our study looked at whether changes in
ligand binding sites resulted in changes in functional responses
to noradrenaline. to eliminate a prejunctional component to
supersensitivity (due to loss of nerve terminals and noradrenaline transporters), experiments were carried out in the presence
of cocaine to block noradrenaline uptake. as always with rat
vas deferens, the results were complicated, but interesting. the
contractile response to noradrenaline changed from a largely
tonic response with small phasic contractions superimposed in
tissues from vehicle-treated animals, to a predominantly phasic
contraction in tissues from sympathectomised animals. potency of noradrenaline was significantly increased in tissues
from sympathectomised animals in terms of total contraction
but not tonic contraction. we next asked whether phasic
contractions differed from tonic contractions in the receptor
subtype involved. we have previously investigated this
problem but found no clear differences (honner & docherty,
1999). the results from vehicle-treated animals in the present
study might suggest that tonic and phasic contractions involve
both a1a- and a1d-adrenoceptors, although a1a-adrenoceptors
may predominate in tonic contractions. the results from
sympathectomised animals give a much more clear answer:
phasic contractions are predominatly a1d-adrenoceptor
mediated (antagonised by bmy 7378 but not rs 100329)
and tonic contractions are predominantly a1a-adrenoceptor
mediated (antagonised by rs 100329 but not bmy 7378).
given that it is less easy to separate the two components of
contraction in vehicle-treated animals, we would like to
suggest that the same is true for vehicle-treated animals: a1d-

vas deferens a1-adrenoceptor subtypes

adrenoceptor mediate phasic and a1a-adrenoceptor mediate
tonic contractions.
a1-adrenoceptor agonists have been used with some limited
success in the treatment of male infertility (kamischke
& nieschlag, 2002). they act to contract the vas deferens, to
treat particularly anejaculation (ae). phasic contractions
are more likely to produce propulsive movements than
tonic contractions. this study suggests that development of
an a1d-adrenoceptor agonist may lead to more effective
therapy for ae, and possibly in retrograde ejaculation (re),
with fewer side effects. a1d-adrenoceptor knockout mice are
apparently fertile, so that this receptor does not seem to be
essential for sperm propulsion (tanoue et al., 2003). however,
in combination with, for instance a  xxxg1643xxx  receptor antagonist
(mulryan et al., 2000), an a1d-adrenoceptor antagonist may
potentially have a role also as a male contraceptive.
it is concluded that the predominant a1-adrenoceptor in
vehicle-treated rat vas deferens is the a1a-adrenoceptor, both in
terms of ligand binding and contractions to exogenous
agonists. the a1d-adrenoceptor, although involved in nerveevoked contractions of rat vas deferens, is only detectable by
ligand binding following chemical sympathectomy. this suggests
that sympathectomy increases the number of receptors in the
junctional region of the postjunctional membrane, or that
these spread to other areas of the smooth muscle. the evidence
obtained from sympathectomised rats suggests that phasic
contractions are mainly a1d-adrenoceptor mediated, whereas
tonic contractions are mainly a1a-adrenoceptor mediated.
