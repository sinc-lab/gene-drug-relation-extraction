thalidomide was a widely used drug in the late 1950s and early
1960s for the treatment of nausea in pregnant women. it became
apparent in the 1960s that thalidomide treatment resulted in
severe birth defects in thousands of children. though the use of
thalidomide was banned in most countries at that time,
thalidomide proved to be a useful treatment for leprosy and later,
multiple myeloma. in rural areas of the world that lack extensive
medical surveillance initiatives, thalidomide treatment of pregnant women with leprosy has continued to cause malformations.
research on thalidomide mechanisms of action is leading to
a better understanding of molecular targets. with an improved
understanding of these molecular targets, safer drugs may be
designed. the thalidomide tragedy marked a turning point in
toxicity testing, as it prompted united states and international
regulatory agencies to develop systematic toxicity testing protocols; the use of thalidomide as a tool in developmental biology led
to important discoveries in the biochemical pathways of limb
development. in celebration of the society of toxicology’s 50th
anniversary, which coincides with the 50th anniversary of the
withdrawal of thalidomide from the market, it is appropriate to
revisit the lessons learned from the thalidomide tragedy of the
1960s.
key words: birth defects; teratogen; multiple myeloma; leprosy;
testing.

thalidomide was first marketed in the late 1950s as
a sedative and was used in the treatment of nausea in pregnant
women (fig. 1). within a few years of the widespread use of
thalidomide in europe, australia, and japan, approximately
10,000 children were born with phocomelia, leading to the ban
of thalidomide in most countries in 1961. some countries
continued to provide access to thalidomide for a couple of
years thereafter (lenz, 1988). in addition to limb reduction
anomalies, other effects later attributed to thalidomide included
congenital heart disease, malformations of the inner and outer

ear, and ocular abnormalities (miller and strömland, 1999).
the thalidomide tragedy was averted in the united states
because of the hold on its approval by dr frances kelsey of the
u.s. food and drug administration, who was recognized by
president john f. kennedy as a recipient of the gold medal
award for distinguished civilian service. dr kelsey’s
decision to hold the approval of thalidomide was not because
of the birth defects, which had not yet been attributed to
thalidomide, but because of her concerns about peripheral
neuropathy (sometimes irreversible) in the patient and the
potential effects a biologically active drug could have after
treatment of pregnant women. the thalidomide tragedy also
brought into sharp focus the importance of rigorous and
relevant testing of pharmaceuticals prior to their introduction
into the marketplace (kelsey, 1988). dr kelsey was awarded
an honorary membership to the society of toxicology in
celebration of its 50th anniversary in 2011.
josef warkany, one of the founders of the teratology
society, doubted in april of 1962 that thalidomide was
responsible for the epidemic of limb defects (warkany, 1988).
his reasoning was that rat experiments had not produced
comparable malformations and that malformations in humans
were inconsistent (i.e., some mothers who were exposed to
thalidomide had normal children and some malformations
occurred in children whose mothers did not knowingly take
thalidomide) (warkany, 1988). the thalidomide episode led to
the adoption of requirements for the systematic testing of
pharmaceutical products for developmental toxicity prior to
marketing. the adoption of these requirements is sometimes
considered a benefit of the thalidomide tragedy. the legacy
of thalidomide extends further than the creation of detailed
testing protocols. with thalidomide came, the widespread
recognition that differences in sensitivity between species
required consideration. as a consequence, developmental
toxicity testing for pharmaceuticals is conducted in two

toxicologists have long held dear the tenet of paracelsus that
‘‘all substances are poisons; there is none which is not
a poison. the right dose differentiates a poison from a remedy.’’

species, one of which is not a rodent. it is not clear, however,
that the routine use of the second species (usually rabbit) has
resulted in better testing, and it has been suggested that a more
thorough understanding of results in a single species may be
preferable (janer et al., 2008).
in order to address potential developmental and reproductive
toxicities of pharmaceuticals, the u.s. fda (1966) laid the
foundation for the development of the segment i (fertility and
general reproduction), ii (teratogenicity), and iii (perinatal)
testing protocols in 1966. prior to the development of the
segment i, ii, and iii testing protocols, toxicology testing was
more hypothesis driven rather than a systematic bioassay
testing strategy that is in place today. the segment i, ii, and iii
studies, or their international conference on harmonisation
and organisation for economic co-operation and development
equivalents, are performed in addition to routine short-term,
subchronic, and chronic toxicity assays and have been in place
with little change for over 40 years.
an examination of the pubmed literature database revealed
a bimodal pattern (fig. 2) in the number of citations containing

thalidomide as a keyword. as a direct result of the thalidomide
tragedy in the early 1960s, not surprisingly, there was a steady
number of publications in that decade. because of the ban in its
use, interest in thalidomide waned in the 1970s and 1980s. for
reasons that will be described below, the number of
thalidomide publications began increasing in the latter half of
the 1990s and have increased dramatically in the last 10 years.
though its use in pregnant women was banned in 1961,
thalidomide continues to be used in the treatment of leprosy
because of its immunomodulatory properties. the world
health organization still does not recommend thalidomide
for the treatment of leprosy because of its use in areas of poor
medical surveillance resulting in a number of thalidomideaffected children (http://www.who.int/lep/research/thalidomide/en/).
in 1998, thalidomide was approved by the u.s. food and
drug administration for the treatment of leprosy and, subsequently, for multiple myeloma. studies are ongoing to evaluate
the effectiveness of thalidomide in the treatment of other
diseases. thalidomide inhibits angiogenesis and could be used
to treat human diseases that are dependent on angiogenesis.
inhibition of angiogenesis is one of the proposed mechanisms of
action for thalidomide’s teratogenic properties (discussed below).
as a ‘‘model’’ teratogen, thalidomide is also being used as
a tool to evaluate the predictivity of alternative testing methods
such as in vitro assays.

overview of thalidomide

mechanisms of action

a diverse collection of thalidomide mechanisms of action
has been proposed (hansen and harris, 2004; stephens, 1988).
hansen and harris (2004) noted over 30 hypotheses for the
mechanism of thalidomide teratogenicity from 1966 to 2003,

fig. 3. critical exposure periods for thalidomide embryopathy during
human development.

including: (1) acylation of macromolecules, (2)  xxxd228xxx 
synthesis, (3) downregulation of adhesion receptors, (4) alteration of cytokine synthesis, (5)  xxxd2146xxx  antagonism,
(6) inhibition of dna synthesis, (7) dna oxidation, (8)
interference of glutamate metabolism, and (9) mesonephrosstimulated chondrogenesis. as described below, more recent
research has focused on hypotheses involving (1) oxidative
stress/damage, (2) dna intercalation, (3) inhibition of
angiogenesis, and (4)  xxxg514xxx  ( xxxg514xxx ) binding.
thalidomide has been reported to increase the production of
oxygen radicals and induce oxidative stress (hansen and harris,
2004). for example, rabbits treated with 400 mg/kg/day
thalidomide on gestational day (gd) 8–12 produced litters with
phocomelia (parman et al., 1999). for dna oxidation studies,
the rabbits were treated 6 h before sacrifice with a single dose of
400 mg/kg (parman et al., 1999). levels of dna oxidation in
maternal tissues (liver, lung, kidney, brain, and placenta) and in
embryos were decreased when the rabbits were pretreated (by
15 min) with 40 mg/kg phenyl n-tert-butylnitrone (pbn; a spintrapping agent). cotreatment of the rabbits with pbn also
reduced the incidences of phocomelia (parman et al., 1999).
using in vitro whole embryo culture techniques,
rat (thalidomide-resistant sprague-dawley) and rabbit
(thalidomide-sensitive new zealand white) embryos were
exposed to thalidomide (0, 5, 15, and 30lm), and changes in
glutathione were assessed (hansen et al., 1999). the rabbit
embryo cultures exhibited glutathione depletion (to 50% of
control values) at 15lm, about twice the peak concentration
achieved in humans on therapy, whereas rat embryo cultures did
not. glutathione depletion was also observed in the rabbit but not
rat visceral yolk sacs at 15lm thalidomide. these experiments
suggested a species-specific role for oxidative stress in
thalidomide teratogenesis, though the mechanism still needs
exploration.
hansen and harris (2004) have proposed that nuclear factor
kappa-b (nf-jb) mediates the redox regulation of limb
outgrowth. pregnant rabbits, which are thalidomide-sensitive,
were treated with thalidomide (70 mg/kg bw/day) on gd 8–12
and pregnant rats, which are thalidomide insensitive, were
treated with thalidomide (300 mg/kg bw/day) on gd 9–13.
limb buds were harvested on the last day of treatment, and
green fluorescent protein (gfp) reporter vectors containing
 xxxg1559xxx -binding promoter sites were transfected into the cells
for expression experiments (hansen et al., 2002). gfp
expression was decreased in thalidomide-exposed rabbit limb
bud cells, whereas rat limb bud cells did not exhibit such
a decrease. in situ hybridization of rabbit embryos (maternal
rabbits treated with 400 mg/kg/day thalidomide) demonstrated
decreased expression of genes (twist, fibroblast growth factor
[fgf]-8, fgf-10) involved in the proposed pathway (hansen
and harris, 2004). decreased gfp expression in the transfected
limb bud cells and decreased expression of twist, fgf-8, and
fgf-10 could be prevented by cotreatment with the free radical
spin-trapping compound pbn.

(gallo, 2008). for developmental and reproductive toxicology,
this tenet needs to be modified with a consideration of the
exposure period. in the early 1960s, it was recognized that the
timing of exposure was as important as the dose for teratogenic
effects (lenz, 1962; nowack, 1965). based on the literature,
miller and strömland (1999) and miller et al. (2009) constructed a timetable of critical exposure periods for thalidomide
embryopathy. for example, the window of exposure in humans
for upper limb malformations is days 24–32 postfertilization;
the window for lower limb malformations is days 27–34
postfertilization (miller and strömland, 1999). other endpoints
include external ear malformations (days 20–24), inner ear
malformations (days 24–34), thumb hypoplasia (days 21–28),
and triphalangism of the thumbs (days 32–36). the sensitive
period during pregnancy for thalidomide effects in humans is
approximately days 20–34 after fertilization (miller and
strömland, 1999; miller et al., 2009). a summary of these
windows of critical exposures and limb defects is presented in
figure 3.
miller and strömland (1999) also listed other findings in
thalidomide-exposed children: kidney malformations, ventricular septal defects, dental malformations, autism and mental
retardation, ocular anomalies, and duane syndrome (lack of the
sixth nerve and aberrant innervation of ocular muscles by the
third cranial nerve) (miller et al., 2009). autism and mental
retardation, ocular anomalies, and duane syndrome are not
always accompanied by limb anomalies.

to evaluate  xxxg514xxx  function in vivo. zebrafish have a  xxxg514xxx 
ortholog (zcrbn) that is 70% identical to human  xxxg514xxx .
zebrafish injected with an antisense morpholino oligonucleotide for zcrbn exhibited a phenotype (defects in fin and
otic vesicle development) similar to that found in zebrafish
treated with very high concentrations of thalidomide (0, 200, or
400lm); coinjection with zcrbn messenger rna rescued the
embryos from those antisense-induced defects. more compelling
was the observation that zebrafish expressing zcrbn mutant
proteins (with low thalidomide binding affinity) were resistant to
thalidomide effects; in addition, normal zebrafish embryos that
are thalidomide sensitive were rescued when the zcrbn mutant
protein was overexpressed. these antisense experiments
were repeated using the zebrafish ortholog to cul4a, resulting
in similar observations. the zebrafish knockdowns for
zcrbn and zcul4a also exhibited decreased fgf-8 expression. chick embryos were used to confirm the findings.
thalidomide-induced limb defects were attenuated by overexpression of the mutant human  xxxg514xxx  protein possessing low
thalidomide-binding affinity.
there is evidence to support all the hypotheses for
the mechanisms of action of thalidomide limb teratogenicity:
(1) oxidative stress/damage, (2) dna intercalation, (3)
inhibition of angiogenesis, and (4)  xxxg514xxx  binding, although
the use in some experiments of very high concentrations of
thalidomide raises questions about more clinically relevant
exposure levels. the proposed mechanisms are not mutually
exclusive. it is quite possible that several of the proposed
mechanisms are working in parallel or synergistically to result
in the hallmark thalidomide-associated limb anomalies.

the continued use of thalidomide

thalidomide appears to operate through anti-inflammatory and
anti-angiogenesis mechanisms (calabrese and fleischer, 2000;
matthews and mccoy, 2003). these properties of thalidomide
have been used as the basis for the treatment of leprosy (calabrese
and fleischer, 2000; sheskin, 1965, 1980) and multiple myeloma
(calabrese and fleischer, 2000; miller and strömland, 1999).
leprosy patients with erythema nodosum leprosum exhibit
vasculitic nodules and sometimes severe neuritis, conditions that
cause extreme pain. thalidomide administration to these patients
is useful in suppressing these reactions.
thalidomide has also been used to treat the wasting
syndrome of advanced hiv infection (calabrese and fleischer,
2000; matthews and mccoy, 2003). this syndrome is marked
by increased  xxxg2296xxx -a, the synthesis of which
can by inhibited by thalidomide. other diseases proposed to
benefit from the anti-inflammatory properties of thalidomide
include systemic lupus erythematosus, nodular prurigo, behcxet
syndrome, erythema nodosum, längerhans cell histiocytosis,
and graft versus host disease (calabrese and fleischer, 2000;
matthews and mccoy, 2003).

mutant mice that are deficient in antioxidant enzymes (i.e.,
 xxxg825xxx ) or glutathione or that
have inhibition of glutathione peroxidase or reductase are more
sensitive to thalidomide embryopathy than are wild-type mice
(reviewed by wells et al., [2005]). in addition, p53 knockout
mice that are deficient in dna damage responses and repair are
also more sensitive to thalidomide- and radiation-induced
embryopathies. thalidomide has also been observed to induce
cell death via upregulation of bone morphogenetic proteins and
the wnt antagonist, dickkopf1 ( xxxg639xxx ), resulting in inhibition of
wnt/b-catenin signaling in chicken embryos and human embryo
fibroblasts (at about 5 times the maximum human therapeutic
concentration) but not in mouse embryo fibroblasts (knobloch
et al., 2007). perturbation of signaling pathways via oxidative
stress has been hypothesized to result in apoptosis of key
progenitor cells in limb development (knobloch and ruther,
2008; knobloch et al., 2008).
as early as 1986, koch and czejka (1986) reported the
intercalation by thalidomide of dna of various specimens.
stephens et al. (2000) demonstrated that thalidomide binds to
gc-rich promoter sites by intercalation and thereby decreases
the transcription of insulin-like growth factor (igf-1) and
 xxxg787xxx . these gene products are known to stimulate transcription of a5- and b3-integrin subunit genes, resulting in
stimulation of angiogenesis in the limb bud and proper limb
growth. this theory is consistent with thalidomide exerting its
teratogenic effects by inhibiting angiogenesis (stephens et al.,
2000; stephens and fillmore, 2000). to investigate a hypothesis
that thalidomide interferes with genes regulated by gc-rich
promoters by blocking the binding of sp-1, drucker et al.
(2003) reported this same observation while studying the
mechanism of thalidomide in the treatment of multiple myeloma.
inhibition of angiogenesis may be a mechanism of thalidomide
action common to teratogenicity and utility against multiple
myeloma (drucker et al., 2003; stephens et al., 2000).
d’amato et al. (1994) demonstrated in a rabbit cornea
micropocket assay that fgf-induced angiogenesis could be
inhibited by thalidomide. pellets containing basic fibroblast
growth factor and  xxxd3252xxx  were implanted into the micropockets
of both corneas of rabbits to stimulate angiogenesis. thalidomide
(200 mg/kg) administered by gavage on the same day as pellet
implantation resulted in inhibited angiogenesis. therapontos et al.
(2009) reported that those thalidomide analogs that were antiangiogenic but not anti-inflammatory could induce limb defects in
chicken embryos. thalidomide caused temporary blockage of
mature blood vessels but caused complete obliteration of
immature blood vessels in the chicken embryo, resulting in the
hallmark limb defects (therapontos et al., 2009).
a recent publication by ito et al. (2010) reported that
 xxxg514xxx  is a thalidomide-binding protein.  xxxg514xxx  normally
forms an e3 ubiquitin ligase complex with damaged dna
binding protein 1 (ddb1) and cullin-4a (cul4a). ddb1
and cul4a are important for the expression of fgf-8 and
limb development. ito et al. (2010) used zebrafish as a model

overview of thalidomide

current and future challenges

as a result of the thalidomide tragedy of the 1960s, the
following lessons were learned:
pharmaceutical products should be systematically tested for
developmental effects prior to marketing.
there are differences in species sensitivity and manifestations
of developmental toxicity.
use of a second species or more thoroughgoing interpretation
of results in a single species (taking pharmacokinetics into
consideration) are important considerations in drug testing.
because thalidomide is useful in the treatment of serious
diseases, it is likely that this product will continue to be used in
therapeutics until safer alternatives become available. prevention
of inadvertent exposure of pregnant women to this drug is
a continuing challenge, particularly in parts of the world where
access to the drug is less restricted than in the united states.
the development of thalidomide analogs that retain the
therapeutic benefits of the drug without its teratogenic liability
is a second challenge. the goal of a safe thalidomide analog
may be elusive if the therapeutic mechanisms of action and the
teratogenic mechanisms of action are closely related or even
identical.
research into mechanisms of action remains a priority for
a better understanding of whether and how safer alternatives can
be developed. toward this end, significant advances over the last
two decades in molecular techniques and alternative test species
have provided unique methodologies to test hypotheses on
thalidomide’s mechanisms of action. technologies such as the
in vitro whole embryo culture test and zebrafish have been used
to gain insight into mechanisms of action. the recent publication
by ito et al. (2010) exemplifies the use of advanced molecular
techniques and an alternative test species (zebrafish) for facile
phenotypic evaluations to understand mechanisms. advances in
gene expression analysis (pathway analysis, snp) and omics
technologies within the last 10–15 years now allow a rapid
collection of information to further our understanding of
embryonic development and perturbation of key developmental
pathways. hopefully, technological advances will also provide
opportunities to investigate the less frequently encountered
endpoints associated with thalidomide (e.g., autism, mental
retardation, ocular anomalies, duane syndrome) on which
literature is limited.

as an anti-angiogenic drug, thalidomide inhibits tumor hypervascularity, growth, and metastasis (calabrese and fleischer,
2000). because of these properties, thalidomide has been
demonstrated to be useful in the treatment of multiple myeloma.
the fda has mandated a strict surveillance program to
prevent the availability of thalidomide to pregnant women. the
celgene corporation (the maker of thalidomide) has developed
a program called system for thalidomide education and
prescribing safety (steps) to safeguard against potential
exposure of pregnant women (public affairs committee
[pac], 2000). the steps program requires that physicians
prescribing thalidomide in the united states be registered with
the program and that both male and female patients adhere to
mandatory contraceptive plans. steps is a three-step program:
(1) physicians must educate patients on the potential benefits and
side-effects of thalidomide, (2) patients must receive contraceptive counseling and regular pregnancy testing, and (3) patients
must provide informed consent and continued participation in
mandatory surveys. prescribers of thalidomide that do not
comply with any of these steps will not have prescriptions
honored at registered pharmacies (pac, 2000). the steps
program also has the following strict requirements to decrease
the possibility of exposure to pregnant women: (1) only a 4-week
supply can be prescribed with no automatic refills and (2) female
patients must use two forms of birth control. the steps program
has so far been successful in managing the risks of thalidomide
teratogenicity in the united states (uhl et al., 2006). however,
the availability of thalidomide has not been restricted in other
areas of the world for the treatment of leprosy; access to
thalidomide has likely resulted in cases of thalidomideassociated phocomelia on many continents but has been
particularly well documented in south america (castilla et al.,
1996; schuler-faccini et al., 2007).
a recent publication by johnson et al. (2011) investigated
the association of thalidomide-associated peripheral neuropathy with single nucleotide polymorphisms (snp) in 1495
multiple myeloma patients. this study reported that the risk of
developing peripheral neuropathy was mediated by polymorphisms in genes involved in repair and inflammation of
the peripheral nervous system. though the mechanism of
thalidomide-associated peripheral neuropathy is unclear, this
report illustrates the continued interest in understanding
thalidomide’s effects.
lenalidomide is a thalidomide analog currently used in the
treatment of multiple myeloma. an evaluation of lenalidomide
developmental toxicity in rabbits concluded that embryo-fetal
effects were only manifested at maternally toxic doses
(christian et al., 2007). this finding contrasts with thalidomide
studies, in which teratogenesis is observed at nonmaternally
toxic doses. lenalidomide possesses antineoplastic activities
that are important for its therapeutic use but does not appear to
have the developmental toxicity associated with thalidomide.
however, more research is needed to understand the mechanistic differences between the two compounds.
