abstract: the molecular bases for  xxxg1701xxx  (pde5) catalytic-site affinity for cyclic guanosine
monophosphate (cgmp) and potency of inhibitors are poorly understood. cocrystal structures of pde5
catalytic (c) domain with inhibitors reveal a hydrogen bond and hydrophobic interactions with tyr-612,
hydrogen bonds with gln-817, a hydrophobic clamp formed by phe-820 and val-782, and contacts with
his-613, leu-765, and phe-786 [sung et al. (2003) nature 425, 98-102; huai et al. (2004) j. biol.
chem. 279, 13095-13101]. present results of point mutations of full-length pde5 showed that maximum
catalysis was decreased 2650-fold in h613a and 55-fold in f820a. catalytic-site affinities for cgmp,
vardenafil, sildenafil, tadalafil, or  xxxd2388xxx  ( xxxd2388xxx ) were respectively weakened 14-,
123-, 30-, 51-, and 43-fold for y612a; 63-, 511-, 43-, 95- and 61-fold for q817a; and 59-, 448-, 71-,
137-, and 93-fold for f820a. the data indicate that these three amino acids are major determinants of
affinity for cgmp and potency of selective and nonselective inhibitors, and that higher vardenafil potency
over sildenafil and tadalafil results from stronger contacts with tyr-612, gln-817, and phe-820. affinity
of v782a for cgmp, vardenafil, sildenafil, tadalafil, or  xxxd2388xxx  was reduced 5.5-, 23-, 10-, 3-, and 12fold, respectively. change in affinity for cgmp, vardenafil, sildenafil, or  xxxd2388xxx  in y612f, h613a, l765a,
or f786a was less, but affinity of h613a or f786a for tadalafil was weakened 37- and 17-fold,
respectively. the results quantify the role of pde5 catalytic-site residues for cgmp and inhibitors, indicate
that tyr-612, gln-817, and phe-820 are the most important cgmp or inhibitor contacts studied, and identify
residues that contribute to selectivity among different classes of inhibitors.

cyclic nucleotide (cn)1 phosphodiesterases (pdes) are key
regulators of signaling by cyclic adenosine and guanosine
monophosphate (camp and cgmp), and inhibition of pdes
by drugs can lead to elevation of intracellular camp/cgmp.
the mammalian pde superfamily is composed of 11 families
of enzymes (3). each pde monomer contains a conserved
carboxyl-terminal catalytic (c) domain composed of ∼270
amino acids (figure 1). nineteen c-domain residues are
invariant among mammalian pdes. the x-ray crystal
structures of the isolated c domain of mammalian pdes
reveal strong similarity in the general topography of the
catalytic site (1, 4-8).
the similarity of pde catalytic sites has complicated
development of inhibitors that are highly selective for a
particular pde family or subfamily (9). many nonspecific
pde inhibitors such as caffeine, theophylline, and 3-isobutyl1-methylxanthine ( xxxd2388xxx ) contain a heterocyclic ring that

can block interaction of cn with the catalytic site of many
pdes. despite the similarity in the pde catalytic sites,
compounds have been identified in recent years that preferentially inhibit particular pde families; examples include
 xxxd1698xxx  ( xxxd1698xxx ), a  xxxg1695xxx -selective inhibitor;  xxxd3142xxx , a
pde4-selective inhibitor; and sildenafil (viagra), tadalafil
(cialis), vardenafil (levitra), and  xxxd3464xxx  ( xxxd3464xxx ), pde5selective inhibitors (3). however, despite the pressing need
to develop selective pde inhibitors as therapeutic drugs, the
molecular mechanisms by which conserved c domains of
the various pde families simultaneously recognize substrates
and inhibitors as well as distinguish among selective inhibitors are poorly understood.
the recent availability of x-ray crystal structures of a
number of pde isolated c domains in complex with various
inhibitors provides the promise of a more rational approach
to the design of new inhibitors and further optimization of
their potencies and selectivities (1, 7, 8, 10-15). even so,
the information imparted by x-ray crystal structures is
primarily descriptive, and in most instances the relative
energy contributed by each contact to the potency and
selectivity for binding of a particular inhibitor is unknown.
to date, pdes have been crystallized as isolated c domains
without attached regulatory (r) domains. it is now clear that
contacts with some inhibitors differ between the isolated c
domain and its corresponding holoenzyme; this emphasizes

amino acid requirements for pde5 catalytic-site ligands

biochemistry, vol. 46, no. 47, 2007 13555

hpde3a (np_000912); 4b, hpde4b (np_002591); 5a, hpde5 (np-001074); 6a, hpde6a (np_000431); 7a, hpde7a (np_002594);

amino acids in c domains of mammalian pdes are in red, highly conserved residues are in blue, and less conserved residues are in green.
the pde5 amino acids underlined are those that have been shown in the crystal structure of human pde5 to be in contact with the fused
double ring of the bound inhibitors as shown in figure 2a and 2b. except for ile-768, all of these were mutated in the present study.

the importance of examining the impact of particular amino
acids on affinity for ligands in the context of the holoenzyme
(16, 17). cocrystal structures of pde5 isolated c domain
with 5′-gmp and several inhibitors reveal numerous contacts
between c domain residues and either the product or
inhibitors (figure 2) (1, 2, 9, 11, 15); up to now, the structure
of an active pde c domain containing substrate has not been
observed since the cyclic phosphate ring is hydrolyzed when
the molecule is infused into the crystals (12) (h. ke, personal
communication).
three pde5-selective inhibitors [sildenafil (viagra), vardenafil (levitra), and tadalafil (cialis)] are highly successful
pharmacological agents for treatment of erectile dysfunction,
and more recently, sildenafil (revatio) has been approved
for treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension.  xxxd3464xxx 
( xxxd3464xxx ), another pde5-selective inhibitor, has recently been
approved for marketing in korea. while these inhibitors share
some structural similarity with the pde5 substrate, cgmp,
they are 1000-40 000-fold more potent than cgmp or
 xxxd2388xxx , a nonselective pde inhibitor (18). the potency of
pde5-selective inhibitors is due to contacts that simulate
interactions formed with cgmp as well as novel contacts
that cgmp does not make.
cocrystals of pde5 with 5′-gmp, sildenafil, vardenafil,
tadalafil, and  xxxd2388xxx  have indicated that each ligand exploits
some of the same contacts. in previous reports, we have
quantified the contribution of tyr-612 to affinity of pde5
for cgmp and potency of vardenafil and sildenafil (19) and
of gln-817 to affinity for cgmp, vardenafil, sildenafil, and
 xxxd2388xxx  (20). quantification of the role of pde5 catalytic-

site residues for interaction of pde5 with tadalafil has not
been reported. herein, we provide a comprehensive quantification of the contributions of his-613, tyr-612, leu-765,
val-782, phe-786, gln-817, and phe-820 to affinity for
cgmp, vardenafil, sildenafil, tadalafil, and  xxxd2388xxx . on the
basis of x-ray crystal structures of pde5 in complex with
these inhibitors (figure 2) or the product, 5′-gmp (1, 2, 11,
15), and previous mutagenesis studies (19-22), we hypothesize herein that gln-817, phe-820, and tyr-612 are critical
contacts for high-affinity interaction with cgmp, vardenafil,
sildenafil, tadalafil, or  xxxd2388xxx . we also hypothesize that
contributions involving these residues, as well as phe-786,
val-782, and his-613, would significantly differ for the
potencies of the inhibitors. to address these hypotheses, point
mutations have been created to determine the importance of
these amino acids in providing for potency of interaction of
pde5 with cgmp or inhibitors. combined insights from
x-ray crystallographic structures previously reported and the
studies herein provide a more accurate profile of catalyticsite function and will optimize efforts to design drugs with
improved affinities and selectivities.

generation of wild-type and mutant hpde5a1 constructs. human cdna coding for full-length pde5a1
(courtesy of dr. k. omori, tanabe-seiyaku pharmaceutical
co. ltd., saitama, japan) was used as a template to generate
the full-length enzyme by introduction of start and stop
codons at appropriate loci. the resulting pcr fragment was
cloned into pcr 2.1-topo vector (invitrogen), verified by
sequencing, and then ligated into the ecori and noti unique
sites of the baculovirus expression vector pachlt-a
(pharmingen). pachlt-a vector contains a his6 sequence
in front of the coding region. this step resulted in plasmid
paca-pde5 (m1-n875), which generated n-terminally histagged recombinant hpde5a1. the quick change sitedirected mutagenesis kit (stratagene) was used to make point
mutations (tyr-612 to ala, his-613 to ala, leu-765 to ala,
val-782 to ala, phe-786 to ala, gln-817 to ala, and phe820 to ala) in the paca-pde5 expression vector according
to the manufacturer’s protocol by use of the following pairs
of mutagenic oligonucleotides (altered bases underlined): (1)

expression of hpde5a1 proteins. sf9 cells (bd pharmingen) were cotransfected with baculogold linear baculovirus
dna (bd pharmingen) and one of the hpde5a1 constructs
in the pachlt-a baculovirus expression vector by the
calcium phosphate method according to the protocol from
bd pharmingen. at 5 days postinfection, the cotransfection
supernatant was collected, amplified three times in sf9 cells,
and then used directly as viral stock without additional
purification of recombinant viruses. sf9 cells grown at
27 °c in complete grace’s insect medium with 10% fetal
bovine serum and 10 µg/ml gentamicin (sigma) in t-175
flasks (corning) were typically infected with 100 µl of viral
stock/flask and then harvested at 92 h postinfection.
purification of hpde5a1 proteins. the sf9 cell pellet from
each t-175 flask (∼2 × 107 cells) was resuspended in
3 ml of ice-cold buffer (20 mm tris-hcl, ph 8, and
100 mm nacl) containing protease inhibitor mixture lacking
edta (complete; roche molecular biochemicals) as recommended by the manufacturer. cell suspension was homogenized in 10-20-ml aliquots on ice by 2 × 6-s bursts
in an ultra-turrex microhomogenizer (tekmar) with a 20-s
recovery between bursts. cell homogenate was centrifuged
(10 000 rpm in a beckman ja-20 rotor) for 20 min at 4 °c,
and the supernatant was applied to a ni-nta agarose
(qiagen) column (1 × 2 cm) equilibrated with buffer
containing 20mm tris-hcl, ph 8, and 100 mm nacl. the
column was washed with 100 ml of the equilibration buffer
followed by washes with the same buffer containing a
stepwise gradient of imidazole (0.8-20 mm). the same
buffer containing 100 mm imidazole was then soaked into
the resin, and the column was incubated for 2 h at 4 °c before
10 1-ml fractions were collected. fractions containing pde5
protein were pooled and dialyzed versus 2000 volumes of
ice-cold 10 mm potassium phosphate, ph 6.8, and 25 mm
 xxxd26xxx  (kpm buffer) containing 150 mm nacl
to remove imidazole. all purification steps were done at
4 °c; enzyme was flash-frozen in kpm buffer containing
150 mm nacl and 10% sucrose and stored at -70 °c.
activity in frozen samples was stable for at least 10 months.
sds-page. purity and physical integrity of proteins were
assessed by sodium  xxxd3215xxx -polyacrylamide gel
electrophoresis (sds-page). protein samples were boiled
for 4 min in the presence of 10% sds, 2 m  xxxd26xxx , and 0.1% bromphenol blue and subjected to sds12% page before visualization by coomassie brilliant blue
staining.
cgmp binding. to measure allosteric cgmp binding,
millipore filter binding assays were conducted in a total
volume of 50 µl of reaction mixture that contained 10 mm
potassium phosphate buffer, ph 6.8, 1 mm edta, 0.5 mg/
ml histone type iotaiota-as, 30 mm dl-dithiothreitol, 0.2 mm
sildenafil, and either 3 µm (for stoichiometry determination)
or 0.05-4 µm (for binding affinity determination) of [3h]cgmp (25). the binding reaction was initiated by addition
of enzyme and incubated on ice for 60 min. one milliliter
of cold buffer containing 10 mm potassium phosphate, ph
6.8 (kp buffer), was added to each sample, and samples were

filters (pore size 0.45 µm). filters were washed with 2 ml
of cold kp buffer two times, dried, and counted in nonaqueous ready safe scintillation cocktail (beckman). counts
bound to pde5 were corrected by subtraction of nonspecific
binding (+1 mm unlabeled cgmp). blanks containing no
pde5 were included for each [3h]cgmp concentration.
pde catalytic activity and inhibitor selectivity of hpde5a1
proteins. pde activity was determined by a modification of
the assay described previously (20). reaction mixture
contained 50 mm tris-hcl, ph 7.5, 10 mm mgcl2, 0.3 mg/
ml bovine  xxxg124xxx , 0-750 µm cgmp and [3h]cgmp
(60 000-150 000 cpm/assay tube) as substrate, and one of
the pde5 proteins in a total volume of 50-100 µl. assay
incubation time was 10-20 min at 30 °c. the apparent km
and vmax or kcat values were determined by nonlinear
regression analysis of data with prism graphpad software.
in all studies, less than 10% of total [3h]cgmp was
hydrolyzed during the reaction. to determine ic50 values
for sildenafil, vardenafil, tadalafil or  xxxd2388xxx , pde catalytic
activity was assayed in triplicate in three experiments in the
presence of a wide range of inhibitor concentrations (from
1 to 109 pm) and 0.5 µm cgmp as substrate.
calculation of free energy of binding. all values
determined represent three measurements, each in triplicate.
the value for the gibbs free energy change, ∆g, that occurs
by association of either cgmp, vardenafil, sildenafil, tadalafil, or  xxxd2388xxx  with pde5 is related to the equilibrium
association constant for the interaction and was calculated
from

where k ) km or ki, r is the ideal gas constant (equal to
1.98 × 10-3 kcal deg-1 mol-1), and t is the temperature at
which the assay was done (303 k). ki values were calculated
from the experimentally determined ic50 values for the
inhibitors:

expression and purification of hpde5a1 proteins. proteins were his-tagged constructs of full-length hpde5a1;
they included pde5a1 containing wild-type sequence,
pde5wt (m1-n875), and mutants containing the following
substitutions: tyr612phe (pde5y612f), tyr612ala (pde5y612a),
his613ala (pde5h613a), leu765ala (pde5l765a), val782ala
(pde5v782a), phe786ala (pde5f786a), gln817ala (pde5q817a),
and phe820ala (pde5f820a). all proteins were expressed at
high levels (∼2-3 mg/l of culture) in a baculovirus/sf9
expression system, and detected on sds-page followed
by western blot analysis with a polyclonal pde5-specific

mutants. a 5 µg aliquot of wild-type or mutant hpde5a1 protein
that had been expressed in sf9 cells and purified to apparent
homogeneity through the ni-nta chromatography step as described
under experimental procedures was applied to each lane. low

size markers. proteins were visualized by staining the gel with

antibody (results not shown). following purification as
described under experimental procedures, each exhibited a
high degree of purity (>98%) as determined by sds-page
[12% (w/v) gel] stained with coomassie brilliant blue
(figure 3) and migrated with essentially the same mobility
as that of pde5wt (a 99-kda band). this migration correlated
well with the predicted molecular weight based on amino
acid composition of hpde5. this indicated that all mutated
pde5s were expressed as full-length proteins. pde5 proteins
were characterized with respect to their allosteric cgmpbinding properties, kinetics of catalytic activity, and potency
of inhibition by vardenafil, sildenafil, tadalafil, or  xxxd2388xxx .
structural integrity of pde5 mutants. to address overall
structural integrity of the mutant pde5 constructs, stoichiometry and affinity of [3h]cgmp binding to the allosteric
cgmp-binding sites in the r domain of pde5 proteins were
determined as described under experimental procedures. all
 xxxg1701xxx  mutants bound cgmp with affinities (kd ∼ 190210 nm) comparable to that of pde5wt (kd ∼ 200 nm).
the stoichiometry of cgmp binding for each mutant protein
was 0.5-0.55 mol of [3h]cgmp per pde5a1 monomer,
which was similar to that of pde5wt (0.6 mol of [3h]cgmp
per monomer; data not shown). these values approximated
those reported for native and non-his-tagged recombinant
bovine pde5 (22, 26). the data indicated that overall
structures of the proteins were preserved and that differences
in their kinetic parameters and inhibitor affinities were not
due to nonspecific conformational effects induced by mutations.
kinetic analyses of pde5 proteins. the kinetic characteristics of catalytic function (kcat and km for cgmp) of each
purified pde5 construct were determined as described under
experimental procedures (table 1, figure 4). the impact of
each of the mutated amino acids on enzyme function fell
into three categories: (1) those defective mainly in kcat, (2)
those defective mainly in km, and (3) those defective in both
parameters. pde5wt had a km for cgmp of 2.9 ( 0.8 µm
and vmax of 1.3 ( 0.3 µmol min-1 mg-1 (kcat value of 2.2 (
0.4 s-1). only pde5h613a and pde5f820a had markedly
reduced kcat values, less than 0.04% and 1.8% that for
pde5wt, respectively (table 1). pde5y612a, pde5l765a,

values represent the average of three experiments of triplicate determinations ( standard deviations. x-fold effect for km was determined by
dividing the km value for mutant by that for wild type for each protein. change in the free energy of binding in enzyme-transition-state complexes
attributable to the substituted group (∆∆g) was calculated by subtracting the ∆g value for mutant from that for wild type for each protein.

figure 4: comparison of cgmp hydrolysis by pde5wt, pde5y612a,
pde5v782a, pde5q817a, and pde5f820a. phosphodiesterase assays
were conducted as described under experimental procedures. the
data are derived from one of three experiments performed in
triplicate and analyzed by use of prism graphpad software (singlesite model). error bars indicate range of values within the single
experiment shown. experiments were conducted at a substrate
concentration of 0-750 µm cgmp as described under experimental
procedures.

pde5f786a, pde5q817a, and pde5f820a exhibited the most
significant reductions in affinity for substrate compared to
pde5wt (14-, 10-, 10-, 63-, and 59-fold, respectively).
effect of mutation of his-613 on pde5 catalytic function
and affinity for inhibitors. pdeh613a profoundly lowered
catalytic activity (kcat ) 0.00083 ( 0.00005), but affinity
for cgmp was decreased only 2.5-fold (km ) 7.1 ( 2.4 µm)
(table 1); this result was verified for two separate preparations of purified h613a (figure 3). potency of pde5h613a
inhibition by vardenafil, sildenafil, tadalafil, or  xxxd2388xxx  (ic50
0.78, 13.2, 81, or 42 000 nm, respectively) was weaker than
that for pde5wt (ic50 0.12, 3.3, 2.2, or 3500 nm, respectively) (table 2). this mutation produced a particularly
significant decline in tadalafil affinity (37-fold), compared
to a more modest decline in affinity for vardenafil, sildenafil
or  xxxd2388xxx  (7-, 4-, or 12-fold, respectively). these results are
in good agreement with our previous report (22) that
substitution of the corresponding residue in bovine  xxxg1701xxx 
(his-603) with ala produced a marked decrease in kcat (39fold) and a modest decline in affinity for the cgmp substrate
(3-fold) and the inhibitor zaprinast (6-fold), suggesting that
his-613 is likely to be important for efficient catalysis.
effect of mutation of tyr-612 on pde5 catalytic function
and affinity for inhibitors. we previously showed that
pde5y612a had a 15-fold decrease in affinity for cgmp,
whereas kcat decreased only 2.5-fold (19). pde5y612a had a
∼123-fold loss in affinity for vardenafil which was much
higher loss than that for sildenafil, tadalafil, or  xxxd2388xxx  [30-,
-51-, and 43-fold, respectively (table 2)]. substitution of
phenylalanine for tyr-612 only slightly reduced affinity for

cgmp (2-fold) or tadalafil (∼3-fold), but affinity for
sildenafil, vardenafil, or  xxxd2388xxx  improved ∼2-fold. the kcat
of pde5y612f was unchanged compared to that of pde5wt.
our previous work (22) showed that the corresponding
mutant (pde5y602a) in bovine pde5 exhibited dramatic
increases in km for cgmp (32-fold), with a modest decrease
in kcat and affinity for zaprinast (4- and 7-fold, respectively),
suggesting that this residue is particularly important for
cgmp binding in the catalytic site. zaprinast is a potent
competitive inhibitor of pde5, but the key residues for its
binding differ significantly from those for cgmp, vardenafil,
sildenafil, and tadalafil.
effect of mutation of gln-817 on pde5 catalytic function
and affinity for inhibitors. our previous results showed that
substitution of gln-817 by alanine (pde5q817a) significantly
altered affinity of the enzyme for cgmp, sildenafil, vardenafil, or  xxxd2388xxx , but maximum catalytic activity was not
compromised (20). in the present studies the effect of this
mutation on tadalafil potency was compared to the effect
on affinity for cgmp and the other three inhibitors. pde5q817a
again exhibited a 63-fold decrease in affinity for cgmp (km
) 182 ( 5.2 µm) (figure 4, table 1) and potency for
inhibitors was also decreased: vardenafil (511-fold), sildenafil (43-fold), tadalafil (95-fold), and  xxxd2388xxx  (61-fold) (figure
5, table 2).
effects of mutation of amino acids involved in hydrophobic clamp on pde5 catalytic function and affinity for
inhibitors. the cocrystal structures of pde5 in complex with
inhibitors revealed a “hydrophobic clamp” that is formed
by phe-820 and val-782 in the inhibitor-binding pocket. the
fused double rings of 5′-gmp, sildenafil, vardenafil, tadalafil,
and  xxxd2388xxx  are sandwiched (figure 2) between the hydrophobic side chains of these residues. to examine the impact
of the interactions of phe-820 and val-782 with substrate
and inhibitors, these residues were individually replaced by
alanine (pde5f820a and pde5v782a, respectively).
pde5f820a had a significant reduction in affinity for cgmp
and catalytic activity. km for cgmp was weakened 59-fold
(172 ( 5.5 µm) compared to that for pde5wt (2.9 (
0.8 µm) (figure 4, table 1), and catalytic activity (kcat )
0.04 ( 0.005) was reduced 55-fold compared to pde5wt
(figure 4, table 1). potencies of vardenafil, sildenafil,
tadalafil, and  xxxd2388xxx  were also significantly decreased (448-,
71-, 137-, and 93-fold, respectively) (figure 5, table 2)
compared to pde5wt. this mutation produced a particularly
dramatic decline in vardenafil affinity compared to that for
sildenafil, tadalafil, or  xxxd2388xxx . the potency of vardenafil over

all values are mean ( sem of three experiments of triplicate determinations. to facilitate comparison, the ic50 values for vardenafil, sildenafil,
tadalafil and  xxxd2388xxx  for pde5wt were taken as 1.0. the corresponding values for the pde5 mutants were divided by the pde5wt value to calculate
the x-fold change.

pde5f820a was determined as described under experimental procedures with 0.5 µm cgmp substrate. the data are derived from one of
three experiments performed in triplicate and analyzed with prism graphpad software (single-site model). error bars indicate range of
values within the single experiment shown. the final concentration of pde5 proteins used in these studies was 0.45-0.70 nm.

sildenafil declined sharply from 28-fold in pde5wt to 4-fold
in pde5f820a.
changes in affinity of pde5v782a for cgmp and catalytic
function were much less than that of pde5f820a; pde5v782a
exhibited a ∼6-fold loss in affinity for cgmp as substrate
(km ) 15.9 ( 2.3 µm) (figure 4, table 1) and no significant
change in kcat. the deleterious effects of the alanine substitution of val-782 on potency of vardenafil, sildenafil, tadalafil,
and  xxxd2388xxx  were substantially less (23-, 10-, 3-, and 12-fold,
respectively) (figure 5, table 2) than the effects of substitution of phe-820. the relative influence of phe-820 in the
hydrophobic clamp compared to that of val-782 (x-fold effect
of f820a vs v782a) on affinity for cgmp, vardenaflil,
sildenafil, tadalafil, and  xxxd2388xxx  varied somewhat (10.7-, 19.4-,
7.1-, 45.7-, and 7.8-fold, respectively), but the influence of
phe-820 was always substantially greater for all five ligands.
these results revealed the particular importance of phe-820
in the hydrophobic clamp to provide effective hydrophobic
interaction for pde5 inhibitors.
influence from other catalytic-site residues on pde5
catalytic activity and inhibitor affinity. the importance of
other hydrophobic contacts (phe-786 and leu-765) previously identified in the substrate and inhibitor binding pocket

of pde5 were also quantified. pde5f786a showed a 10-fold
decrease in affinity for cgmp (km ) 29.7 ( 2.7 µm) (table
1) with no decline in catalytic activity (kcat ) 3.7 ( 0.2);
this revealed the involvement of hydrophobic interactions
of phe-786 in substrate binding. potency of inhibition of
pde5f786a by vardenafil, sildenafil, tadalafil, or  xxxd2388xxx  was
significantly weaker than that for pde5wt (7-, 6-, 17-, and
12-fold, respectively) (table 2). mutation of leu-765
(pde5l765a), which is in close proximity with inhibitors in
the x-ray cocrystal structures of pde5 c domain (figure
2), weakened affinity for cgmp by ∼10-fold but had a
modest effect on kcat (table 1). change in affinity of
pde5l765a for vardenafil, sildenafil, tadalafil, or  xxxd2388xxx  was
modest (4-, 3-, 4-, and 0.9-fold, respectively).
contribution of catalytic-site amino acids to free energy
of binding of cgmp or inhibitors. the energy involved in
interactions of cgmp, vardenafil, sildenafil, tadalafil, or
 xxxd2388xxx  with pde5wt were quantified from the km for cgmp
or the ki for the respective inhibitors by calculating the gibbs
free energy of binding (∆g) of 7.7, 13.8. 11.0, 12.1, and
7.5 kcal mol-1, respectively, as described under experimental
procedures. these values reflected the varying affinities with
which the respective ligands bind to the pde5 catalytic site.

all values are average of three experiments of triplicate determinations. change in the free energy of binding in enzyme-transition-state
complexes attributable to the substituted group (∆∆g) was calculated by subtracting the ∆g value for mutant from that for wild type for each
protein for each inhibitor.

in mutant proteins, the magnitude of the contribution of the
substituted amino acid side chains to the binding energy in
enzyme-transition-state complexes (∆∆g) was quantified
by calculating the gibbs free energy of binding (∆g) of
cgmp, vardenafil, sildenafil, tadalafil, and  xxxd2388xxx  in pde5
mutants compared to the free energy of binding of these
ligands in pde5wt (tables 1 and 3).
the change in the free energy of binding (∆∆g) of
pde5y612a for cgmp, vardenafil, sildenafil, tadalafil, or
 xxxd2388xxx  was equivalent to 1.6, 2.9, 2.0, 2.4, and 2.3 kcal
mol-1, respectively (table 3). the free energy of binding
(∆∆g) of pde5q817a with cgmp, vardenafil, sildenafil,
tadalafil, or  xxxd2388xxx  was substantially weakened compared
to pde5wt as reflected in ∆∆g values that were decreased
by 2.5, 3.7, 2.3, 2.7, and 2.5 kcal mol-1, respectively (table
3). the magnitude of the change in free energy of binding
of pde5y612a for vardenafil and tadalafil as well as the
change in pde5q817a for cgmp and inhibitors was consistent
with loss of at least one hydrogen bond (27, 28). the loss
of free energy of binding (∆∆g) in the pde5f820a mutant
for cgmp, vardenafil, sildenafil, tadalafil, and  xxxd2388xxx  was
equivalent to 2.5, 3.7, 2.6, 3.0, and 2.7 kcal mol-1,
respectively (table 3), suggesting that stacking interactions
might have a role in higher binding affinity of pde5 toward
vardenafil in comparison with cgmp and other inhibitors.
discussion
pde5 provides a major portion of the cgmp-hydrolyzing
activity in many tissues; it is the target of sildenafil (viagra),
tadalafil (cialis), vardenafil (levitra), and  xxxd3464xxx  ( xxxd3464xxx ),
all of which are competitive inhibitors of pde5 and used
for treatment of male erectile dysfunction and other maladies
associated with vascular diseases. however, the molecular
bases for interaction of either substrate, cgmp, or inibitors
with the pde5 catalytic site are still poorly understood. in
the present study, tyr-612, his-613, leu-765, val-782, phe786, gln-817, and phe-820, which in x-ray structures of
cocrystals of pde5 with either 5′-gmp or inhibitor were
shown to be in close proximity to these ligands, have been
individually mutated to alanine. the importance of these
residues to catalysis and interaction with either substrate or
inhibitors varies substantially. all mutations diminish catalytic efficiency, in most cases due to effects on km for the
substrate, cgmp. tyr-612, gln-817, and phe-820 play
prominent roles in interaction of pde5 with catalytic-site
ligands irrespective of their absolute potencies; phe-820 and

his-613 also importantly impact catalytic rate. the kcat values
of pde5y612a, pde5v782a, pde5f786a, and pde5q817a are
either equal to or exceed that for pde5wt, and kcat is
modestly lowered in pde5y612a and pde5l765a. allosteric
cgmp-binding function in all mutants is similar to that of
pde5wt. in combination, these characteristics make it
unlikely that the effects of these mutations are the result of
general impairment of the protein, although, as with any
study using site-directed mutagenesis, this possibility cannot
be ruled out. it is unlikely that the catalytic-site mutations
alter quaternary structure of pde5 since the high-affinity
(kd < 20 pm) dimerization contacts within the enzyme
structure are located in the regulatory domain (25).
the importance of contact(s) provided by invariant tyr612 for binding four inhibitors of differing potencies and
structures exceeds that for substrate (cgmp) affinity or
catalysis. according to the x-ray cocrystal structures, tyr612 contributes both hydrophobic and hydrophilic interactions in the pde5 catalytic site (1, 2, 11), and the pde5y612a
mutant has a dramatic loss in affinity for cgmp and
inhibitors. a nitrogen in the five-member ring of sildenafil
or vardenafil forms a hydrogen bond with a water that is
hydrogen-bonded to the tyr-612 hydroxyl and another water
that coordinates to the catalytic-site zn2+ (figure 2a) (1,
11). tadalafil does not make similar contacts (figure 2b)
(1). removal of the tyr-612 hydroxyl (pde5y612f) actually
increases affinity for sildenafil, vardenafil, and  xxxd2388xxx . this
is surprising since the hydrogen-bond bridge involving the
hydroxyl (figure 2a) would have been predicted to increase
affinity (1, 11). however, this hydroxyl may compromise
interaction with the inhibitors by altering orientation of the
phenyl ring or reducing volume in the catalytic pocket.
tadalafil or cgmp affinity is modestly reduced despite the
fact that tadalafil lacks the hydrogen-bond contact (figure
2b) (1). the results indicate that tyr-612 contributes
substantially to the potency difference between vardenafil
and sildenafil or tadalafil and that the phenyl ring is critical
for potency of interaction with all five catalytic-site ligands.
gln-817 is invariant in mammalian pdes; this glutamine
has been suggested to be an important determinant of
substrate affinity in the pde superfamily, but evaluation of
the effect of point mutation of this residue on substrate
affinity and specificity has been tested only in pde5 (15,
20). the x-ray crystal structure of pde5 isolated c domain
in complex with the low-affinity product, 5′-gmp, implies
that the gln-817 side chain forms a bidentate hydrogen bond

amino acid requirements for pde5 catalytic-site ligands
with guanine (15). the x-ray cocrystal structure of pde5
with sildenafil, vardenafil, or  xxxd2388xxx  exhibits similar bidentate
hydrogen bonding with gln-817, whereas tadalafil forms a
single hydrogen bond (1, 2, 11). pde5q817a exhibits major
loss in affinity for cgmp, vardenafil, sildenafil, tadalafil,
and  xxxd2388xxx  but not for camp, a low-affinity substrate, which
suggests that the low affinity of camp interaction may result
in part from poor contact with gln-817 (20). loss in
vardenafil potency in pde5q817a is 5-12 times greater than
that for the other ligands. pde5q817a selectivity for vardenafil
over sildenafil or tadalafil, compared to pde5wt, declines
from 28- to ∼2-fold and from 18- to ∼3-fold, respectively.
pde5q817a kcat for cgmp is greater than that for pde5wt
(1.7-fold); affinity for camp is only 2-fold weaker than that
for pde5wt, and kcat for camp, which is similar to that for
cgmp, is unaffected (20). this indicates that the deleterious
effect of this mutation on cgmp catalysis is not due to
generalized impairment of the catalytic site.
despite absolute differences in pde5 affinity for these
inhibitors, and disparate hydrogen-bonding patterns reported
or predicted from x-ray crystallographic structures, the loss
in free energy for each is similar. in particular, the loss in
free energy of binding in pde5q817a for sildenafil and  xxxd2388xxx ,
both of which form bidentate bonds with gln-817 in the
x-ray crystal structures, is the same as the loss in free energy
for tadalafil binding, which forms only one hydrogen bond
with gln-817 in the cocrystal x-ray structure (1, 2, 11). since
the absolute energy that is involved in a hydrogen bond
between a ligand and its protein receptor varies considerably
(27-29), it cannot be stated with certainty that the hydrogenbonding patterns for ligands suggested from the present
studies differ from those detected in the x-ray cocrystal
structures with isolated c domain. however, as was concluded many years ago, the results of studies demonstrating
the high affinity of pde5 for cgmp analogues containing a
substituent at the n-1 position [1-ch3-cgmp, 1, n2-phenyletheno-cgmp, beta-(2-napthyl)-1,n2-etheno-cgmp, and 1,n2(4-methoxyphenyletheno)-cgmp] indicate that hydrogen
bonding via the n-1 hydrogen of the pyrimidine of cgmp
is not a key component of affinity for cgmp or cgmp
analogues (30-32). rather, the combined results of analogue
studies, mutagenesis studies, and calculation of the loss in
free energy support the interpretation that there is functionally
a single hydrogen bond contact between gln-817 in the
catalytic site of pde5 and the c-6 carbonyl oxygen (or the
equivalent thereof) in cgmp, vardenafil, sildenafil, or  xxxd2388xxx .
we have earlier reported another difference between
predictions from x-ray crystal structure of pde5 isolated c
domain and effects of mutations in the holoenzyme. in that
study, mutation of gln-775 (pde5q775a), which in the x-ray
crystal structure forms a hydrogen bond with gln-817,
thereby orienting the gln-817 side chain for purportedly
optimal bidentate hydrogen bonding with substrate, has no
effect on affinity for vardenafil or sildenafil (20); in x-ray
crystal structures, vardenafil and sildenafil are predicted to
require the same fixed orientation of the gln-817 side chain
for forming these bonds. the differences between the
predicted importance of bonds in the x-ray crystal structures
and the impact of removal of these bonds by point mutation
or amino-teminal truncation mutants on interaction in solution with several ligands (cgmp, vardenafil, sildenafil,
 xxxd2388xxx , and camp) emphasize the importance of assessing

biochemistry, vol. 46, no. 47, 2007 13561
functional significance of amino acids in the context of the
holoenzyme (16).
a hydrophobic clamp anchors substrate or inhibitors in
the active site of mammalian pdes (1, 2, 5, 8, 10-12). the
phenylalanine that forms one side of the clamp (phe-820 in
 xxxg1701xxx ) is conserved in almost all mammalian pdes, and
another conserved hydrophobic residue (val-782 in pde5)
forms the other side. in x-ray cocrystal structures, all four
inhibitors interact with the clamp (and based on modeling,
cgmp does also). the five-membered rings in vardenafil,
sildenafil, and  xxxd2388xxx  form a face-to-face pi-pi electron
stacking interaction with the phe-820 phenyl ring (figure
2a).
the dramatic difference in effect of the f820a mutation
on vardenafil versus cgmp or sildenafil affinity indicates
that, despite purportedly similar interactions between phe820 and vardenafil, sildenafil, or 5′-gmp, respectively, as
indicated in the x-ray cocrystal structures, significant differences exist. the results also emphasize the importance
of phe-820 along with gln-817 as a determinant of vardenafil
potency and selectivity over sildenafil or tadalafil. the similar
magnitude of change in affinity for sildenafil and  xxxd2388xxx  in
pde5f820a indicates that, despite the ∼1200-fold difference
in potencies, the relative importance of phe-820 for binding
of each is similar.
substitution of val-782 impacts affinity of the inhibitors
far less than that for substitution of phe-820. pde5v782a
exhibits a 3-fold decline in tadalafil potency compared to
the 137-fold decline in pde5f820a. this suggests that tadalafil
primarily contacts phe-820 in the clamp. in x-ray cocrystal
structures leu-765 is closely approximated to the inhibitors,
but pde5l765a has modest effects on inhibitor potency with
slightly greater impact on cgmp affinity. pde5f786a exhibits
modest effects on potency of vardenafil, sildenafil,  xxxd2388xxx ,
or cgmp, whereas tadalafil inhibitory potency is reduced
17-fold. this suggests that targeting differences in the impact
of amino acids in the hydrophobic clamp region on inhibitor
potency within and among pde families may be useful in
designing selective pde inhibitors for particular pdes.
his-613, which is invariant in all class i pdes, is closely
juxtaposed to the heterocyclic ring of several inhibitors in
the x-ray cocrystal structures but lacks direct contact.
pde5h613a affinity for cgmp, vardenafil, sildenafil, or  xxxd2388xxx 
is modestly impaired, but tadalafil potency is affected more
(37-fold). this suggests that tadalafil positioning in the
catalytic site directly or indirectly exploits structural features
provided by his-613. as reported previously, pde5h613a has
a major loss in catalytic function (22). taken together, the
data indicate that his-613 provides for optimal substrate
hydrolysis in pde5 and high affinity for certain classes of
inhibitors.
to date, x-ray crystal structures of pde catalytic sites
share many conserved physical features that provide contacts
for binding substrate as well as selective and nonselective
inhibitors (5, 7-9, 11, 12, 33). structural variation within
and external to the catalytic sites provides for major
differences in interaction with inhibitors, but the differences
are not fully defined. we recently reported selective impact
of pde5 r domain on potency of vardenafil over sildenafil
or tadalafil (16), and similar observations have been made
regarding pde4 affinity for  xxxd3142xxx  (17, 34). combined
insights derived from x-ray crystallographic structures of

13562 biochemistry, vol. 46, no. 47, 2007
isolated c domains and enzymatic studies using mutated pde
holoenzymes allow for better quantification of the impact
of highly conserved structural features on potency of
inhibitors of varying structures. these insights will aid
significantly in the design of more potent and selective
inhibitors toward different pde families or even within a
pde family. this is the first comprehensive study to address
the quantitative contribution of amino acids in the catalytic
site of any pde using the x-ray crystal structure for
direction.
