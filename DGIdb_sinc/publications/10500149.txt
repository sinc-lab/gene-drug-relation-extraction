‘‘adrenal androgen’’ group. it has also been known that adiol
can bind directly to the  xxxg730xxx  (er) and act as an
estrogen at physiological concentrations (5). the in vitro
androgenic activity of adiol, like that of testosterone, is
relatively weak but greatly augmented by some selective ar
coactivators, such as ara70 (6–12). orchiectomy decreases
the blood concentration of adiol by approximately 50% (13).
adiol is produced in very small amounts by the adrenal glands
(14) but in greater amounts from dhea conversion in several
tissues (15). its concentration in blood plasma is directly
proportional to the higher intracellular concentration of
dhea and dhea-sulfate (16, 17). another important piece
of evidence, as demonstrated by labrie et al. (18), is that total
androgen blockage caused only a 41% reduction in the serum
adiol level. thus, the serum levels of adiol in patients
undergoing total androgen blockage treatment remain relatively high and may still be able to activate ar target genes.
therefore, blocking the androgenic activity of the remaining
adiol may be worth considering. however, our previous study
suggested that treatment with hf or  xxxd334xxx  may be
insufficient to block adiol action in ar-positive prostate
cancer and may provide a possible explanation for the well
documented disappointing clinical findings (4).
this evidence suggested that there could be a potential
benefit in blocking androgenic activity of adiol in patients with
prostate cancer. to accomplish this blocking, we have tested
22 dhea derivatives兾metabolites (fig. 1) as potential antiandrogenic compounds to see whether these compounds can
compete with adiol and block its action on ar transcriptional
activity in human prostate cancer cells. we found that four of
them can inhibit adiol-induced ar transcriptional activity in
pc-3 cells.

abstract
our earlier report suggested that androst-5ene-3␤,7␤-diol (⌬5-androstenediol or adiol) is a natural
hormone with androgenic activity and that two potent antiandrogens, hydroxyf lutamide ( xxxd2143xxx ) and  xxxd334xxx 
( xxxd334xxx ), fail to block completely the adiol-induced  xxxg183xxx  (ar) transactivation in prostate cancer cells.
here, we report the development of a reporter assay to screen
several selective steroids with anti-adiol activity. among 22
derivatives兾metabolites of dehydroepiandrosterone, we found
4 steroids [no. 4, 1,3,5(10)-estratriene-17␣-ethynyl-3,17␤diol; no. 6, 17␣-ethynyl-androstene-diol; no. 8, 3␤,17␤dihydroxy-androst-5-ene-16-one; and no. 10, 3␤-methylcarbonate-androst-5-ene-7, xxxd2153xxx ] that have no androgenic
activity and could also block the adiol-induced ar transactivation in prostate cancer pc-3 cells. interestingly, these
compounds, in combination with hydroxyf lutamide, further
suppressed the adiol-induced ar transactivation. reporter
assays further showed that these four anti-adiol steroids have
relatively lower glucocorticoid, progesterone, and estrogenic
activity. together, these data suggest some selective steroids
might have anti-adiol activity, which may have potential
clinical application in the battle against the androgendependent prostate cancer growth.
prostate cancer represents the most commonly diagnosed
noncutaneous malignancy in aging males and is the second
leading cause of cancer-related death in north american men
(1). androgen ablation has been the cornerstone of treatment
for advanced forms of this disease, and a combination therapy
of surgical or medical castration with an antiandrogen, such as
hydroxyflutamide (hf;  xxxd2143xxx ) or  xxxd334xxx  ( xxxd334xxx ), is
now widely used to reduce the level of endogenous androgens
coming from, for example, adrenal sources (2).
limiting the availability of androgens to regional or metastatic prostate cancers usually induces remission, but after
some time, the cancer may become refractory to treatment. it
has been suggested that genetic changes of the androgen
receptor (ar) gene may contribute to a short response to
hormone therapy (3). however, the mechanisms responsible
for androgen independence remain uncharacterized. the reason for this poor response is enigmatic, but the recent findings
(4) that androst-5-ene-3␤,7␤-diol (adiol) can activate ar
target genes and that two potent antiandrogens, hf and
 xxxd334xxx , fail to block completely the androgenic activity
of adiol in human prostate cancer cells may offer one of the
possible explanations.

fig. 1. the effects of various dhea metabolites on the transcriptional activity of ar. pc-3 cells were transiently transfected with 1.5 ␮g of
wild-type ar (wtar) and 4.5 ␮g of mouse mammalian tumor virus (mmtv)-chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (cat). after a 24-h transfection,
cells were cultured without hormones (mock) or with 1 nm 5␣-dihydrotestosterone (dht) or with 1,000, 10, or 0.1 nm of various dhea metabolites.
the cat activity was determined, and the ethanol (etoh) treatment was set as 1-fold. values are the means ⫾ sd of at least three determinations.
the numbers of various dhea metabolites and derivatives were assigned arbitrarily. on the y axis, these compounds were arranged in order of
the strength of induced ar transcriptional activity by the compounds at the concentration of 1 ␮m.

were performed as described (4, 6, 7). briefly, 4 ⫻ 105 cells
were plated on 60-mm dishes 24 h before transfection, and the
medium was changed to phenol-red-free dmem with 10%
(vol兾vol) charcoal-stripped fcs 1 h before transfection. the
cells were transfected by using the calcium phosphate precipitation method. the total amount of dna was adjusted to 8.5
␮g with psg5 in each transfection assay. after a 24-h transfection, the medium was changed again, and the cells were
treated with hormones for another 24 h. the cells were then
harvested, and whole-cell extracts were used for cat assay.
transfection efficiency was normalized by ␤-galactosidase
activity. the cat activity was quantitated with a phosphorimager (molecular dynamics).

results
induction of ar transcriptional activity by dhea derivatives. for the screening of these 22 dhea derivatives, we first
investigated their ability to induce ar transcriptional activity
in the ar-negative pc-3 cell line. the results of the cat assay
were obtained by transient cotransfection of ar plasmid and
androgen response element-reporter plasmid (mmtv-cat).
after transfection, the cells were treated with various dhea
derivatives at 1,000, 10, and 0.1 nm. as shown in fig. 1, 11
compounds (nos. 0, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 13, 15, 16, 18, and 22) had very
little androgenic activity and induced only small ar transactivation.

further screening of anti-adiol activity of dhea derivatives with low androgenic effects. dhea derivatives (n ⫽ 10)
were screened further for their anti-adiol activity on ar
transactivation in pc-3 cells. cells were cotransfected with ar
plasmid and mmtv-cat reporter in the presence of 50 nm
adiol and these 10 dhea derivatives  xxxd1891xxx , 100, or 1,000 nm.
as shown in fig. 2b, compounds nos. 4, 6, 8, and 10 have better
suppression effects on adiol-induced ar transcriptional activity. at the concentration of 0.1–1 ␮m, compounds nos. 4 and
6 can suppress the adiol-induced ar transactivation to less
than 30%. the chemical structures of compounds nos. 4, 6, 8,
and 10 are shown in fig. 2 a. the six other dhea derivatives
(nos. 0, 5, 13, 15, 18, and 22) show either activation or no
suppression effect on the adiol-mediated ar transcriptional
activity (fig. 2b).
anti-dht effect of dhea derivatives (nos. 4, 6, 8, and 10).
we then investigated whether these four anti-adiol compounds have the ability to repress dht-induced ar transactivation. pc-3 cells were cotransfected with ar plasmid and
mmtv-cat reporter in the presence of 1 nm dht and these
compounds  xxxd1891xxx , 100, or 1,000 nm. as shown in fig. 3,
compound no. 4 turned out to be the best suppressor and can
repress the dht-induced ar transactivation to less than 40%
at 1 ␮m.
dhea derivatives (nos. 4, 6, 8, and 10) can further
suppress the adiol-induced ar transcriptional activity in

age (treated with castration plus antiandrogen), we further
tested the ability of these four compounds to block adiolinduced ar transactivation in combination with hf. in the
presence of 1 ␮m hf, 50 nm adiol, and 10–1,000 nm of these
four compounds, pc-3 cells were transiently transfected with
ar plasmid and mmtv-cat reporter. as shown in fig. 4, hf
could suppress the adiol-mediated ar transcription activity
to 60%. after adding these four compounds, transcription
activity was decreased to less than 25%.
steroid hormone specificity of dhea metabolites (nos. 4,
6, 8, and 10). the er-positive mcf-7 cells were transfected
with ere-cat reporter, and pc-3 cells were transfected with
mmtv-cat reporter and  xxxg1737xxx  (pr) or

 xxxg1601xxx  (gr) to test the steroid hormone
specificity of these four compounds. as shown in fig. 5, all four
compounds have some estrogenic activity, and only compound
no. 4, which has a 17␣-ethynyl group, shows some weak pr
activity. this result agreed with previous findings that steroids
with an ethynyl group may have some progesterone activity.
none of these four steroid compounds show any gr activity.

we have screened many steroids derived from dhea for their
ability to block the adiol-induced ar transactivation and
found four steroid derivatives that can inhibit adiol-induced

this screening system, which uses transient transfection and

prostate cancer undergoing androgen ablation therapy, some
compounds with anti-dht and兾or anti-adiol effects identified from the screening may have potential values in prostate

androgen ablation has been the cornerstone of treatment
for advanced prostate cancer, but most of the androgendependent prostate cancers progress into androgen independence. in addition, the phenomenon that antiandrogens act as

agonists, the so-called antiandrogen-withdrawal syndrome, has
been reported in many patients with prostate cancer (21).
however, the detailed molecular mechanisms for the progression and withdrawal syndrome remain unclear. it has been
suggested that mutations in the ar gene may contribute to
androgen independence and the agonist effect of antiandrogens (22, 23). other reports showed that hf could also activate
the transcriptional activity of wtar (24, 25). our previous
reports also showed that, under some conditions, certain
selective ar coactivators could enhance the agonist effect of
antiandrogens, including hf (8, 9, 26, 27). moreover, our early
studies showed that adiol itself is an androgenic hormone and
its androgenic activity also can be enhanced significantly by
some selective ar coactivators in du145 prostate cancer cells
(4). all these data may provide some possible explanations for
androgen independence and withdrawal response.
based on the above explanations, we have been interested in
identifying some compounds that have the ability to block
adiol-mediated ar transcriptional activity in prostate cancer
cells. our results have shown four dhea derivatives that have
no intrinsic androgenic activity (fig. 1) and also block adiolinduced ar transactivation with (fig. 3) or without (fig. 2)
addition of hf. because compounds that can repress ar
transactivation may become potential therapeutic drugs for

biochemistry: chang et al.
prostate cancer, these four compounds screened from this
study may have some chance of becoming therapeutic drugs.
furthermore, as these four dhea metabolites were shown to
have no agonist effect, they may have a lower risk of causing
withdrawal syndrome.
we have developed a reliable method to screen compounds that can block adiol-mediated ar transactivation
and have found four dhea derivatives as potential antiandrogenic drugs to block the adiol-induced ar transactivation in prostate cancer. these compounds have no intrinsic
androgenic activity as well as the capacity to significantly
repress the adiol-induced ar transactivation with or without other antiandrogens in prostate cancer cells. further
modification of these potentially useful compounds may
allow us to develop new and better antiandrogenic drugs for
the treatment of prostate cancer.
