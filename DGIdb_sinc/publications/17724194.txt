purpose. despite structural similarity with prostaglandin f2␣,
the ocular hypotensive agent  xxxd340xxx  ( xxxd340xxx ; allergan,
inc., irvine, ca) shows unique pharmacology in vitro and
functional activity in vivo. unfortunately, the precise mechanisms that underlie  xxxd340xxx ’s distinctive impact on aqueous humor dynamics are unclear. the purpose of the present
study was to investigate the effects of  xxxd340xxx  and a novel
 xxxd340xxx -selective antagonist agn 211334 on human conventional drainage.
methods. two model systems were used to test the consequences of  xxxd340xxx  and/or agn 211334 treatment on
conventional drainage. human anterior segments in organ culture were perfused at a constant flow rate of 2.5 ␮l/min while
pressure was recorded continuously. after stable baseline facilities were established, segments were treated with drug(s),
and pressure was monitored for an additional 3 days. in parallel, the drugs’ effects on hydraulic conductivity of human
trabecular meshwork (tm) cell monolayers were evaluated.
pharmacological properties of agn 211334 were characterized in isolated feline iris preparations in organ culture and
heterologously expressed g-protein-coupled receptors were
examined in vitro.
results.  xxxd340xxx  increased outflow facility by an average
of 40% ⫾ 10% within 48 hours of treatment (n ⫽ 10, p ⬍
0.001). preincubation or coincubation with agn 211334 significantly blunted  xxxd340xxx ’s effects by 95% or 43%, respectively. similar results were obtained in cell culture experiments
in which  xxxd340xxx  increased hydraulic conductivity of tm
cell monolayers by 78% ⫾ 25%. pretreatment with agn
211334 completely blocked  xxxd340xxx ’s effects, while coincubation decreased its effects on average by 74%. in both

models, agn 211334 alone significantly decreased fluid flux
across trabecular tissues and cells.
conclusions. the findings indicate that  xxxd340xxx  interacts
with a  xxxd340xxx  receptor in the trabecular meshwork to
increase outflow facility. (invest ophthalmol vis sci. 2007;48:

laucoma is a leading cause of adult blindness, affecting
nearly 70 million people worldwide.1,2 the most common form, primary open-angle glaucoma, is characterized by
decreased outflow through the conventional drainage pathway
that results in ocular hypertension.3–5 elevated intraocular
pressure (iop) over time appears to contribute to blindness by
increasing mechanical stress on the optic nerve head, resulting
in irreversible damage to retinal ganglion cell axons.6,7
because of their efficacy at lowering iop, prostaglandin
(pg) compounds have been widely used in clinical practice to
treat ocular hypertension. the first pg mimetic used in the
successful management of iop was  xxxd2446xxx , a synthetic
pgf2␣ analogue.  xxxd2446xxx  is relatively inactive until its isopropyl ester is hydrolyzed to create a biologically active free
acid that then functions as an  xxxg1878xxx  agonist.8 because of
the efficacy of  xxxd2446xxx , two additional mimetics,  xxxd3414xxx 
and unoprostone, have been developed for the treatment of
ocular hypertension. the hypotensive activity of these three
f2␣ analogues seems to be accomplished by long-term remodeling of the extracellular matrix in the ciliary body.9,10 thus,
the iop lowering by pgs appears to be predominantly due to
enhanced uveoscleral (unconventional) outflow.11
recently, a related pg compound, the  xxxd340xxx   xxxd340xxx , was introduced, and has been shown to be an effective
ocular hypotensive agents in patient studies.12–14  xxxd340xxx 
is synthetic molecule derived from anandamide that has structural and pharmacological similarity to pgf2␣ ethanolamide.
although structurally similar, evidence shows that  xxxd340xxx 
possesses unique pharmacologic and pharmacokinetic properties, distinct from known  xxxg1878xxx  agonists. for example,
1000-fold higher concentrations of  xxxd340xxx  than pgf2␣ are
necessary to induce [ca2⫹]i mobilization in cells that express
endogenous fp receptors or cells that heterologously express
human fp receptors.14,15 moreover, clinical pharmacologic
studies with  xxxd340xxx  reveal that, unlike  xxxd2446xxx ,  xxxd340xxx  is not significantly metabolized, because of the absence of free acid hydrolysis product in systemic circulation
after topical ocular administration to human volunteers.16,17
the hydrolysis of  xxxd340xxx  to a free acid occurs at a very
slow rate (⬍1% per hour) when exposed to several ocular and
nonocular tissues in three studies14,16,18 and at a higher rate in
two other studies.19,20 last,  xxxd340xxx  fails to activate more
than 100 known drug targets, including a variety of receptors
that may be involved in regulating iop.14 unfortunately, because a  xxxd340xxx  receptor has not been cloned, the existence of prostamides is currently based on pharmacologic
criteria.

the mechanism by which prostamides differ from pgf2␣
agonists in their efficacy toward iop regulation is still unknown. a recent study showed that  xxxd340xxx  treatment
dampens the increase in iop caused by water drinking in a
group of patients with glaucoma, suggesting an effect on the
pressure-sensitive, conventional drainage pathway.12 in recent
clinical studies,  xxxd340xxx  successfully lowered iop in patients who were refractory to  xxxd2446xxx  therapy, suggesting
differences in the mechanism of action of  xxxd340xxx  and
pgf2␣-receptor agonists.13,21 in addition to changes observed
in the extracellular matrix of the ciliary body, bimatoprosttreated monkeys displayed morphologic changes in their conventional drainage pathway after 1 year of treatment.22 taken
together, these data suggest that  xxxd340xxx  acts on the conventional drainage tract.
to test specifically the effects of  xxxd340xxx  on conventional drainage, we used the anterior segment perfusion model,
that preserves the architecture of the trabecular meshwork
(tm) and allows the testing of conventional outflow function
separately from unconventional function. to examine the role
of  xxxd340xxx  receptors in control of conventional drainage,
we tested the ability of a second-generation  xxxd340xxx -selective antagonist, agn 211334, to block  xxxd340xxx ’s effects.
agn 211334 is the latest compound in the series and is more
than 10 times more potent than the prototypical  xxxd340xxx 
antagonist agn 204396.23 the presence of  xxxd340xxx  receptor activity in human tm cells was tested by recording changes
in hydraulic conductivity of primary cultures of tm cell monolayers on  xxxd340xxx /agn 211334 treatments. results show
that  xxxd340xxx  interacted with  xxxd340xxx  receptors on tm
cells to increase outflow facility in situ and hydraulic conductivity in vitro.

methods
materials
 xxxd340xxx  was synthesized by allergan inc. (irvine, ca). agn
211334 was designed and synthesized by selcia ltd. (ongar, uk). stock
solutions were prepared by dissolving drugs in ethanol giving a stock
concentration of 10⫺3 m for  xxxd340xxx  and 3 ⫻ 10⫺3 m for agn

211334 that were kept at ⫺20°c until use. stock solutions of  xxxd2401xxx  (10⫺2 m; calbiochem, la jolla, ca) were made fresh in perfusion medium. final solutions were prepared fresh by diluting stock
solutions in perfusion medium immediately before chamber exchanges.

anterior segment perfusion model
fresh human eyes were obtained postmortem from the national disease research interchange (philadelphia, pa) and the donor network
of arizona (phoenix, az). characteristics of the eyes are shown in
table 1. the eyes were free of any known ocular disease, and were
stored in moistened chambers at 4°c until dissected. preparation and
perfusion of anterior segments were performed exactly as previously
described by our laboratory, slightly modifying original descriptions of
perfusion methods.24 –27 after dissection and mounting into culture
chambers, anterior segments were perfused at a constant flow rate of
2.5 ␮l/min with dulbecco’s modified eagle’s medium (dmem). to
which antibiotics (penicillin 100 u/ml, streptomycin 100 ␮g/ml; sigma-aldrich, st. louis, mo), bovine  xxxg124xxx  (bsa) 25 mg/dl, and
1% fetal bovine serum (fbs) were added. the anterior segments were
cultured at 37°c in humidified air containing 5% co2. intrachamber
pressures were continuously recorded with dedicated pressure transducers that interfaced with a digital data recorder and computer.
when stable baseline facilities were reached (typically after 2– 4
days of perfusion), medium in anterior segments was exchanged under
approximately 10 mm hg (13.6 cm h2o) of constant pressure with
medium containing 1 ␮m  xxxd340xxx . we chose this concentration
based on ciliary body and iris tissue concentrations of  xxxd340xxx 
observed in topically treated nonhuman primates28 and from preliminary studies in which we performed sequential dose–response exposures (10 nm–1 ␮m) and obtained consistent results only at 1 ␮m (not
shown). contralateral segments were exchanged with 30 ␮m agn
211334 plus 1 ␮m  xxxd340xxx  (protocol 1) or 30 ␮m agn 211334
alone and then were constantly perfused with drug solution. anterior
segments that initially received agn 211334 were exchanged with
medium containing 30 ␮m agn 211334 plus 1 ␮m  xxxd340xxx  after
24 hours of pretreatment (protocol 2) and then were constantly perfused with drug solution. forty-eight hours after initial drug treatments,
medium from anterior segment pairs was exchanged with fresh me-

iovs, september 2007, vol. 48, no. 9
dium without drug(s), and the segments were perfused for an additional 3 to 4 days.

central corneal thickness
a pachymeter (sp-100 handy pachymeter; tomey corp., nagoya, japan) was used to obtain central corneal thickness (cct) measurements
of whole globes on arrival at our laboratory and of anterior segments
during perfusion.27 after initial measurements on whole globes, cct
was measured on anterior segments 2 hours after the start of perfusion,
and every 24 to 48 hours afterward.27 data points were the average of
three readings taken sequentially. if one of the readings was significantly different from the other two (⬎100 ␮m), two more readings
were made, and both the highest and the lowest were discarded. the
slope was calculated from the cct measurements obtained after the
start of perfusion to the day of the first of the drug treatment(s).

morphologic analysis
at the end of perfusion, medium in anterior chambers was exchanged
with 3% paraformaldehyde (pfa) in phosphate-buffered saline (ph 7.4)
under 10 mm hg pressure. after perfusion at 2.5 ␮l/min for 1 hour
with pfa, anterior segments were removed from culture chambers and
several wedges (⬃2 mm wide) containing outflow tissues were cut
from each of four quadrants using a no. 15 scalpel blade and were
stored in 2% pfa. representative wedges from each quadrant were
embedded in spurr’s plastic according to standard methods and stained
with toluidine blue.26 sagittally oriented 0.5 ␮m sections were viewed
by light microscopy (bh-2; olympus, tokyo, japan) with an upright
microscope at magnifications of 200⫻ and 400⫻. all sections were
evaluated in a masked fashion by two observers according to a grading
scheme that is described elsewhere27: 0, no cells in the trabecular
meshwork (tm) or only a few swollen cells, with inner wall disruption
(breaks, other damage) present; 1, only a few cells in the tm, typically
in the juxtacanalicular tissue (jct), but existing cells show little or no
swelling, with the inner wall intact; 2, jct well populated with cells,
corneoscleral and uveal meshworks contain few or no cells, and intact
inner wall; 3, jct and most of corneoscleral meshwork filled with cells,
normal-appearing cells (no swelling), and intact inner wall; and 4,
essentially normal-looking trabecular meshwork, the cells present everywhere in the jct and corneoscleral meshwork (uveal mesh not
considered), and intact inner wall.
the final reported grade for each anterior segment was calculated
by averaging the scores of all four quadrants in an anterior segment
from two observers (table 1).

cell culture
three previously characterized strains of human trabecular meshwork
cells (htm61, -86, and -89) were used in the present study.29,30 htm
cells were cultured in dulbecco’s modified eagle’s medium (lowglucose dmem; invitrogen, carlsbad, ca) and supplemented with 10%
fetal bovine serum (gemini, woodland, ca) and 100 u/ml penicillin,
0.1 mg/ml streptomycin, 0.29 mg/ml glutamine (invitrogen), and
grown in humidified air containing 5% co2 at 37°c. cells (1 ⫻ 105)
were seeded onto polycarbonate membrane filters (tissue culture
treated, 12-mm diameter, 0.4-␮m pore size; corning inc., corning, ny)
at confluence and the monolayers allowed to mature 9 to 12 days for
before the experiments.

cell perfusion
filters with cells were placed in an ussing-type chamber filled with
hepes-buffered dmem (25 mm hepes; ph 7.4). the chamber, tubing,
and reservoir were gently filled with dmem⫹hepes, and the cells
were allowed to acclimate for 30 minutes at 37°c with no pressure
gradient. the experiment was begun by raising the reservoir to 13.6
cm above the midline of the filter containing cells (giving a 10-mm hg
pressure differential across the cells) and allowed to perfuse for 30
minutes at 37°c, giving initial baseline measurement. afterward, the

chamber was exchanged with fresh medium containing 1 ␮m  xxxd2401xxx , 1 ␮m  xxxd340xxx , and/or 30 ␮m agn 211334. the cell
monolayers were again exposed to a pressure head of 10 mm hg for 30
minutes, and hydraulic conductivity was recorded.31,32 the experiments were concluded by removing the filters from the chamber,
rinsing cells twice in phosphate-buffered saline and fixing cells with 4%
paraformaldehyde in pbs. for inclusion of the data, initial hydraulic
conductivity measurements (both before and after mock exchange)
must have been stable, (i.e., within 5% of each other) and in the span
of 1.5 to 6 ␮l/min/mm hg/cm2 such that drug-induced changes relative to the baseline would remain in the range of detection for the
force displacement transducer.

feline iris contraction model
feline iris sphincter tissues prepared as described previously were
mounted vertically under 50 to 100 mg tension in a jacketed 10-ml
organ bath.33 smooth muscle tension of the isolated iris sphincter was
measured isometrically with force displacement transducers (ft-03;
grass telefactor, west warwick, ri) and recorded on a polygraph
(model 7; grass telefactor). the organ baths contained krebs’ solution
maintained at 37°c by a heat exchanger and circulating pump. the
krebs’ solution (118.0 mm nacl, 4.7 mm kcl, 1.2 mm kh2po4, 1.9
mm cacl2, 1.18 mm  xxxd2534xxx , 25.0 mm nahco3, 11.7 mm glucose, and
0.001 mm indomethacin) was gassed with 95% o2 and 5% co2 to give
a ph of 7.4. tissues were allowed 60 minutes to stabilize before each
experiment. the feline iris experiments were designed so that a direct,
four-way comparison for antagonist versus  xxxd340xxx , vehicle versus
 xxxd340xxx , antagonist versus corresponding pg, and vehicle versus
corresponding pg was provided in tissue preparations obtained from a
single animal. one cumulative dose–response curve to agonist was
obtained in each tissue. vehicle (ethanol) and antagonist (agn
211334) were given 30 minutes before the agonist dose–response
curves were constructed. the response to pgf2␣ 10⫺7 m was determined at the beginning and end of each dose–response curve, with
appropriate washout, and responses were calculated as the percentage
of this reference contraction.

ca2ⴙ signaling studies on human recombinant
prostanoid receptors
the use of chimeric g protein cdnas (prostanoid dp, ep1,  xxxg1873xxx ,  xxxg1875xxx ,
fp, ip, and tp) stably expressed in hek-293 ebna cells allowed
responses to gs- and gi-coupled prostanoid receptors to be measured
as a ca2⫹ signal, as previously described.33 ca2⫹ signaling studies were
performed with an flipr (fluorometric imaging plate reader). cells
were seeded at a density of 5 ⫻ 104 cells/well in a poly-d-lysine-coated
(biocoat), black-walled, clear-bottomed, 96-well plates (bd biosciences, franklin lakes, nj) and allowed to attach overnight in an
incubator at 37°c. the cells were then washed twice with hbss-hepes
buffer (hanks’  xxxd2988xxx  without bicarbonate and phenol
red, 20 mm hepes; ph 7.4) with a plate washer (denley cellwash;
labsystems, franklin, ma). after 45 to 60 minutes of dye loading in the
dark using the ca2⫹-sensitive dye fluo-4am, at a final concentration of
2 ⫻ 10⫺6 m, the plates were washed four times with hbss-hepes
buffer to remove excess dye and leaving 100 ␮l of buffer in each well.
the plates were then placed in the flipr instrument and allowed to
equilibrate at 37°c. compound solutions were added in a 50-␮l volume to each well to give the desired final concentration. cells were
excited with an argon laser at 488 nm, and emission was measured
through a 510- to 570-nm band width emission filter (flipr; molecular
devices, sunnyvale, ca). the peak increase in fluorescence intensity
was recorded for each well.
the experimental design for the flipr studies was as follows. on
each plate, four wells each served as negative (hbss-hepes buffer) and
positive controls (standard agonist: for dp, bw 245c; for ep1– xxxg1875xxx ,
pge2; for fp, pgf2␣; for ip, carbaprostacyclin; and for tp, u-46619).
the peak fluorescence change in each well containing drug was
expressed relative to the control. to obtain concentration–response

ventional outflow function. twenty anterior segments from 11
donors were examined. age of donors ranged from 49 to 91
(mean, 67.5 ⫾ 3.5 years), average time from death to enucleation was 6.3 ⫾ 1.1 hours, whereas mean time from death to
perfusion was 34.6 ⫾ 1.6 hours (table 1).
to examine effects of  xxxd340xxx  on conventional drainage, two experimental paradigms were used: in the first, one
anterior segment from a pair with stable outflow facilities was
treated with  xxxd340xxx , and the contralateral segment was
exposed to  xxxd340xxx  (1 ␮m) plus agn 211334 (30 ␮m). in
the second protocol, one segment of the pair was treated with
 xxxd340xxx , and the other was first pretreated with agn
211334 and then 24 hours later was treated with  xxxd340xxx 
plus agn 211334. examples of traces from anterior segments
that were subjected to the two protocols are shown in figure
2. both traces show that  xxxd340xxx ’s effects were immediate
and steady over the 2 days of exposure (black traces). on
washout of  xxxd340xxx  with fresh perfusion medium, we

in addition to postperfusion evaluation of conventional outflow tissues by standard histology, cct slope and outflow
facility were two functional measurements in the present study
that were used to assess the quality of anterior segment tissues
during perfusion (table 1).27 the rate of cct recovery was
calculated as the rate of change of corneal thickness over the
first 3 days of perfusion. on average, the cct of the 20 anterior
segments tested decreased by 1.4 ␮m/h over the first 3 days of
perfusion (table 1).
after administrating drugs, we continued to measure cct
on all anterior segments. we observed that compared to initial

cells, we examined the effects of  xxxd340xxx  on hydraulic
conductivity (hc) across mature monolayers of human tm
cells in culture. figure 6a shows that  xxxd340xxx  (1 ␮m)
increased hc of tm monolayers by 78% ⫾ 25% and 75% ⫾

were not additive or synergistic. to determine the specificity
of agn 211334 on  xxxd340xxx ’s effects in this third model

discussion
our findings provide, for the first time, direct evidence that
 xxxd340xxx  interacts with cells of the conventional drainage
pathway to increase outflow facility. such effects were attenuated significantly by pretreatment or coadministration with
the  xxxd340xxx -specific antagonist agn 211334.  xxxd340xxx 
receptors appear to be located on tm cells, because agn
211334 effectively blocked  xxxd340xxx -induced increases in
hydraulic conductivity of tm cell monolayers. collectively,
these results suggest that in addition to effects shown previously on uveoscleral outflow,  xxxd340xxx  working through
 xxxd340xxx  receptors, increases conventional outflow.
to test our hypothesis that  xxxd340xxx  affects conventional drainage, fresh human anterior segments in organ culture were used, providing several advantages over other model
systems. first, the architecture and cellular relationships in the
conventional drainage tract are preserved; second, the anterior
segment allows for long-term study of drug effects, enabling
multiple manipulations (e.g., sequential drug treatments) to
occur over the lifetime of the experiment35; third, the conventional drainage pathway in humans differs from that in other
species, including nonhuman primates, in terms of micro and
gross anatomy36 –39; last, and most relevant to the present
study, nonhuman primates seem to differ from humans with
respect to  xxxd340xxx ’s effects on outflow facility. thus,  xxxd340xxx  appears to increase conventional and unconventional outflow facility in humans, but only unconventional in
monkeys.14,40
the cellular target (receptor) for  xxxd340xxx  has been
controversial. some argue that  xxxd340xxx  is a prostaglandin
f2␣ prodrug, like  xxxd2446xxx , which on application to the eye
is hydrolyzed and behaves as an  xxxg1878xxx  agonist.19,20 in
fact, when  xxxd340xxx  is hydrolyzed in the test tube, its free
acid potently activates fp receptors.15 however, in some studies  xxxd340xxx  appears to be highly resistant to hydrolysis,
and thus the appearance of the free acid of  xxxd340xxx  is rare
in ocular tissues, particularly in regions such as the ciliary body
thought primarily to mediate outflow effects.19,41 other evidence suggests that pgf2␣ and  xxxd340xxx  interact at different
receptors. when tested in the same tissue preparation, pgf2␣,
and  xxxd340xxx  stimulate calcium transients in different cell
populations34,42 and differentially stimulate connective tissue
growth factor.43 last,  xxxd340xxx  shows no meaningful activity at prostaglandin fp receptors or other pg receptor subtypes
(kd ⱖ 10⫺5 m).16,33
in our hands, agn 211334 effectively blocked bimatoprostand  xxxd340xxx  f2␣- but not pgf2␣-mediated contractions. in
addition, in both of our models for the conventional pathway,
agn 211334 antagonized  xxxd340xxx ’s ( xxxd340xxx ’s) effects
on fluid flow through trabecular tissues and across trabecular
monolayers. agn 211334 alone decreased baseline outflow
facility measurements in perfused anterior segment and initial
hydraulic conductivity measurements for tm cell monolayers,
suggesting that agn 211334 interferes with endogenous signaling pathways or acts as an  xxxd1422xxx  in these preparations. because of potent and reproducible effects of agn
211334 on hydraulic conductivity of tm cell monolayers, this
model will serve as a useful tool to uncover the mechanism of
agn 211334 action in future studies.

glaucoma. in the present study, we observed that  xxxd340xxx 
treatment adversely affected cct measurements, effects that
were antagonized by agn 211334. to our knowledge, corneal
edema has not been reported during clinical trials with  xxxd340xxx . a recent study indicated that other antiglaucoma drugs
including  xxxd2446xxx  may affect the physiologic function of
corneal endothelial cells through change of [ca2⫹]i mobility.44
the effect of  xxxd340xxx  on the corneal endothelium is still
unclear and requires further characterization.
in clinical studies  xxxd340xxx  appears to affect iop earlier
than other prostaglandin mimetics, and effects are long lasting.
 xxxd340xxx  demonstrated effective 24-hour iop control after a
single dose in both human and normal dogs, and almost 10 mm
hg was dropped 4 hours after a single dose in dogs with
glaucomatous eyes.14 in the anterior segment perfusion model
used in the present study,  xxxd340xxx  gradually increased
outflow facility over the 2 days of exposure and continued to
increase outflow facility in some segments after chamber exchange with fresh medium (probably because of difficulty in
washing  xxxd340xxx  out of tissues). consistent with this finding, careful examination of outflow tissues exposed to  xxxd340xxx  with the light microscope revealed no consistent morphologic changes (i.e., breaks in inner wall, data not shown).
in contrast,  xxxd340xxx ’s effects in the cell-perfusion model
were observed immediately, during the first 30 minutes of
exposure. because  xxxd340xxx ’s effects were not additive or
synergistic with  xxxd2401xxx , we concluded that both drugs
affect intracellular pathways that control cell contractility, as
shown before.31 the reasons for the time differences between
the models are unclear. however, in both cases, effects appeared sooner than would be anticipated if  xxxd340xxx  was
influencing remodeling of extracellular matrix in juxtacanalicular tissues or in cell monolayers. alternatively,  xxxd340xxx  may
have two mechanisms of action: one that occurs immediately
and another that occurs over time. for example, we cannot
rule out that  xxxd340xxx  alters the extracellular matrix environment in the conventional drainage tract and/or the sclera,
similar to effects of pgf2␣ and its analogues.45 clearly, more
work needs to be done to characterize  xxxd340xxx ’s effects in
the outflow tracts.
the unique pharmacology of  xxxd340xxx  and its effects on
conventional drainage make it a leading compound for determining mechanisms that regulate resistance to outflow in the
conventional drainage tract. understanding these mechanisms
will enable the design of more efficacious compounds with the
ability to increase conventional outflow in those with ocular
hypertension and glaucoma.
