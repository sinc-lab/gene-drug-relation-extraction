abstract:

 xxxg1626xxx  (odc) is a pyridoxal 5′-phosphate dependent enzyme that catalyzes
the first committed step in the biosynthesis of polyamines. odc is a proven drug target for the treatment
of african sleeping sickness. the enzyme is an obligate homodimer, and the two identical active sites are
formed at the dimer interface. alanine scanning mutagenesis of dimer interface residues in trypanosoma
brucei odc was undertaken to determine the energetic contribution of these residues to subunit association.
twenty-three mutant enzymes were analyzed by analytical ultracentrifugation, and none of the mutations
were found to cause a greater than 1 kcal/mol decrease in dimer stability. these data suggest that the
energetics of the interaction may be distributed across the interface. most significantly, many of the
mutations had large effects (∆∆g kcat/km > 2.5 kcal/mol) on the catalytic efficiency of the enzyme.
residues that affected activity included those in or near the substrate binding site but also a number of
residues that are distant (15-20 å) from this site. these data provide evidence that long-range energetic
coupling of interface residues to the active site is essential for enzyme function, even though structural
changes upon ligand binding to wild-type odc are limited to local conformational changes in the active
site. the odc dimer interface appears to be optimized for catalytic function and not for dimer stability.
thus, small molecules directed to the odc interfaces could impact biological function without having to
overcome the difficult energetic barrier of dissociating the interacting partners.

pharmacological manipulation of interactions between
proteins could alter many cellular processes but is difficult
to achieve. a detailed understanding of the energetics of these
interactions is thus needed. sites of interaction between
proteins typically include a large surface area of interacting
amino acid residues (1), making the task of disrupting the
interaction potentially daunting. systematic mutagenesis of
several receptor-ligand protein interfaces has demonstrated
that small regions of a protein interface can account for the
bulk of the energetic contributions to an interaction (2-6).
these data support the conclusion that the functional epitope
driving these interactions is not simply defined by the
contacts observed by structural analysis of a protein interface.
many enzymes form their active sites at the subunit
interface and thereby require the association of subunits for
activity. thus interactions that influence the energetics of
subunit association may also impact catalytic function, a
complexity that is not a component of the receptor-ligand
interactions that have been previously studied. further, this
influence may extend beyond amino acid residues that
directly participate in the active site structure and involve

residues throughout the subunit interface. the energy of
binding interactions on proteins can be propagated to remote
sites throughout the protein structure (7-9), and amino acid
residues distant from the active site have been shown to
impact catalytic efficiency and/or substrate specificity in
several enzyme systems (10-14). however, no systematic
analysis of the relationship between the protein interface and
catalysis has been undertaken for a multimeric enzyme.
 xxxg1626xxx  (odc)1 catalyzes the decarboxylation of  xxxd2793xxx  to form the diamine putrescine, the first
step in the polyamine biosynthetic pathway. the polyamines
are ubiquitous cell growth factors, and inhibitors of polyamine
biosynthesis have been studied as potential chemotherapeutic
agents in a broad range of proliferative diseases, including
cancer (15) and microbial infections (e.g., african trypanosomiasis 16). odc is a pyridoxal 5′-phosphate (plp)
dependent enzyme and an obligate homodimer. the availability of extensive structural and mechanistic information
(17, 18) makes odc an ideal target to study binding
interactions at the subunit interface and their relationship to
enzyme function. the x-ray structure of trypanosoma brucei
odc reveals two identical active sites that are formed in
the dimer interface. substrate analogues are bound at the
interface, making essential contacts with both subunits
(figure 1). the dimer is in rapid equilibrium with the
1 abbreviations: odc,  xxxg1626xxx ; plp, pyridoxal 5′phosphate;  xxxd1972xxx , r- xxxd2430xxx ; orn,  xxxd2793xxx ; put,
putrescine. t. brucei odc mutant enzymes are designated by single
amino acid code, followed by the residue number and by the
replacement amino acid.

monomers, and the functional requirement for contribution
of active site residues from both subunits has been demonstrated (19).
to evaluate the nature of the interactions that stabilize
dimerization of odc, alanine scanning mutagenesis of t.
brucei odc interface residues was undertaken. the wildtype and mutant enzymes were evaluated by sedimentation
equilibrium analysis and by steady-state kinetic analysis.
none of the mutations caused a significant weakening of
the dimer interaction, suggesting that the structural features
of the odc dimer interface that contribute to the energetics
of subunit association are distributed throughout the interface.
however, mutations of the dimer interface residues caused
significant detrimental effects on enzyme activity. these
effects were not limited to residues in or near the active site
but were distributed throughout the interface.
experimental procedures
materials
amino acids, amines, buffers, and plp were purchased
from sigma. ni2+-agarose was purchased from qiagen.
centricon concentrators were purchased from amicon.
methods
enzyme purification and assay. site-directed mutagenesis
of the odc dna was performed using the quickchange
protocol as recommended by the manufacturers (strategene).
all clones were sequenced throughout the entire coding
region to verify the mutation. wild-type and mutant odcs
were expressed from the cloned gene as his-tag fusion

proteins in bl21/de3 cells from the t7 promoter. odc was
purified by ni2+-agaorose column chromatography and gel
filtration as described (19, 20). odc activity was assayed
at 37 °c using a coupled spectrophotometric assay as
described (19). enzyme concentrations used for the assay
varied depending on the activity of the enzyme. approximate
ranges that were used are as follows: wild-type odc (5200 nm), mutants with kcat’s 10-fold below wild type (0.10.5 µm), mutants with kcat’s 100-fold below wild type (1-5
µm), and mutants with kcat’s >1000-fold lower than wild
type (10-50 µm). substrate concentrations were collected
over a range above and below the km for each mutant
enzyme. data were fitted to the michaelis-menten equation
using sigma plot 5.0 to determine the kinetic constants.
molecular modeling to identify dimer interface residues.
the x-ray structure of native t. brucei odc (pdb 1qu4)
and of the  xxxd1972xxx -bound enzyme (pdb 2tod) were used to
analyze the nature of the amino acid residues at the dimer
interface. interface residues were identified by calculating
the change in solvent-accessible surface area between the
dimer and monomer using the program naccess (36).
analytical ultracentrifugation. analytical ultracentrifugation was performed in a beckman xli centrifuge. odc
samples were analyzed in 100 mm hepes, ph 7.5, 100 mm
nacl, 0.5 mm  xxxd26xxx , and 20 µm plp at 20
°c. a minimum of three odc concentrations (ranging from
3.5 to 14 µm) were used for each analysis. for equilibrium
sedimentation analysis odc was loaded into a six-sector
equilibrium centerpiece, and the protein was equilibrated for
data collection at three rotor speeds (11000, 13 000, and
15 000 rpm). once equilibrium had been reached (typically

in a beckman xli analytical ultracentrifuge. the data in the figure include nine data sets used in the global analysis for a representative
fit to determine the kd for dimer dissociation. the monomer molecular mass was fixed at 49 050 da during the fit, and the baseline values
were allowed to float. the panels (from left to right) represent three odc concentrations (4.8, 9.6, and 14.4 µm). for each odc concentration,
three speeds [from left to right 11 000 (circles), 13 000 (triangles), and 15 000 (squares) rpm]) were collected. the solid line represents the
weighted global fit to a monomer/dimer equilibrium with kd ) 341 nm and 95% confidence limits of 250-460 nm. the residuals to the
fit are shown in the upper panel in absorbance units. the dimerization constant (kd ) 406 ( 92 nm) for wild-type odc was calculated
by averaging the model-derived kd’s from n ) 6 independent experiments where the error is the standard deviation of the mean.

windows at 280 nm, using a radial step size of 0.001 cm,
and recorded as the average of 15 measurements at each
radial position. to determine the baseline values in the cell,
at the end of the data collection time the rotor speed was
increased to 42 000 rpm for 8 h, and the absorbance of the
depleted meniscus was measured (over-speed data).
equilibrium data were analyzed using the beckman
xl-a/xl-i data analysis software version 4.0. a minimum
of nine data sets were included in the global nonlinear leastsquares analysis using a monomer-dimer equilibrium model

enzyme was determined on the basis of the analysis of
multiple (n ) 6) data sets of this type. the full range of
odc concentrations (3.5-14. 4 µm) was explored within
these data sets.
analysis of dimer interface mutations by analytical
ultracentrifugation. the x-ray structure of native t. brucei
odc was used to identify residues in the dimer interface.
the change in solvent-accessible surface area between the
dimer and monomer was calculated using the program
naccess. a total of 2775 å2 of solvent-accessible surface
area is buried in the interface upon dimerization (17); 87%
of the surface area is contributed by amino acid side chains
(figure 3a). the odc dimer interface is formed by
interactions between the c-terminal domains of the two
subunits and between the n-terminal and c-terminal domains

biochemistry, vol. 40, no. 44, 2001 13233
of opposite subunits (figure 1; 17). a row of aromatic
residues (f397, y323, and y331) that pass through the 2-fold
axis and is positioned between the two active sites, makes
up the bulk of the contact between the two c-terminal
domains. the interface between the n-terminal and cterminal domains of the two subunits contains the active site
and is partially composed of hydrophilic interactions between
amino acid side chains and/or backbone carbonyls (e.g.,
 xxxd134xxx /k294,  xxxd364xxx /k169, and i291/k141).
amino acid residues identified to contribute >35 å2 of
surface area to the interface in both the native and dfmobound structures by this analysis were mutated to ala (figure
3a) to determine the contribution of these side chains to the
energetics of the subunit association. the dimer dissociation
constants (kd) for each of the mutant odcs were determined
by analytical ultracentrifugation by collecting a standard data
set of three concentrations and three speeds for each mutant
as described in experimental procedures. the k169a
mutation could not be evaluated because the protein failed
to come to equilibrium despite multiple attempts, a finding
that may be a reflection of reduced stability for this mutant
enzyme. none of the mutations that could be evaluated
increased the kd for dimerization by more than 3-fold
compared to the wild-type value. for several of the mutant
enzymes (e36a, k69a, c114a, w356a, v392a, and
s395a) the kd’s determined for the monomer-dimer equilibrium were approximately 10-fold lower than measured for
the wild-type enzyme. for such monomer-dimer equilibria
the theoretical concentration of monomer present in the
analysis is near the limit of detection [the lower limit of kd
that can be measured is 10 nm (22)], and the accuracy of
the method is reduced.
kinetic analysis of the dimer interface mutations. the
active site of odc is formed at the dimer interface,
suggesting that residues in the dimer interface may also be
important for the catalytic function of the enzyme. to address
this question, steady-state kinetic analysis of the wild-type
and mutant enzymes was undertaken to determine the
michaelis-menten parameters for the decarboxylation of
 xxxd2793xxx . mutation of 18 of the tested interface residues
decreased kcat/km by at least 1 kcal/mol (table 1, figure 4).
predictably, the residues where mutation had the largest
effects (∆∆gkcat/km > 4 kcal/mol) are located in the active
site and participate in either direct contacts with substrate/
analogues or contact mediated through a water molecule [e.g.,
k69, y323,  xxxd361xxx , y389, and f397 (figure 1b)]. the roles
of several of these active site residues (k69, c360, and  xxxd361xxx )
have previously been well characterized (18, 23, 24).
however, mutation of a number of residues that are distant
from the active site also had large detrimental effects (2-3
kcal/mol) on enzyme activity (table 1 and figure 4). these
long-range effects occurred predominately in the interface
region formed by contacts between the n- and c-terminal
domain (figure 1c, residues k141, i291, k294, y317, and
w356), and they effect both kcat (decreases by 2-40-fold)
and km (increases 3-20-fold). the most striking examples
of these long-range effects are for residues k141, i291, and
k294, all of which are 15-20 å from the nearest active site
(figure 1c and table 1).
the specific activity (vmax/et) of wild-type odc is
constant between enzyme concentrations of 5-200 nm (data
not shown), suggesting that the kd for dimer dissociation is

less than 5 nm in the conditions of the assay, which is
minimally 80-fold lower than observed in the analytical
ultracentrifuge. however, there are several notable differences between the assay conditions and those used to analyze
dimer formation by analytical ultracentrifuge. first, the
presence of substrate may affect dimer association. second,
the enzyme activity is measured at 37 °c while the
centrifugation studies were performed at 20 °c and at higher

ionic strength. for most of the mutant enzymes the specific
activity was also constant over the range of enzyme
concentrations tested. however, because many of the mutant
enzymes are significantly less active than the wild-type
enzyme, the concentration of enzyme used for the activity
assay (see experimental procedures) was much higher and
thus does not allow for a comparison of dimer stability under
the conditions of the assay. for i291a odc the specific
activity does not reach maximal levels for enzyme concentrations below 50-100 nm, suggesting that, in contrast to
what was observed by centrifugation, the kd for the dimer
under the conditions of the assay is weaker than for the wildtype enzyme.
discussion
odc is an obligate homodimer with the substrate binding
sites formed at the dimer interface (figure 1). x-ray structure
analysis facilitates identification of the residues that make
contacts at the dimer interface, but the energetic contribution
of the individual residues to subunit association can only be
addressed by functional analysis. alanine scanning mutagenesis of the t. brucei odc dimer interface suggests that no
single amino acid in the interface contributes more than 1
kcal/mol of stabilizing energy to the interaction. these data
suggest that the subunit association is driven by many small
energetic contributions distributed throughout the interface.
these results are in contrast to the interaction “hot spots”
observed in some previously studied systems. analyses of
several protein interfaces by mutagenesis [e.g., the growth
hormone-receptor interaction (2, 3), antibody interactions
with antigen (4, 5), and the barnase-barnstar interaction (6)]
indicated that small regions of a protein interface can account
for the bulk of the energetic contributions to an interaction.
the finding that no significant energetic consequences are
observed upon mutation of dimer interface residues in odc
may be an indication of structural plasticity in the interface.
structural analysis of the antigen-antibody system and of
the barnase-barnstar interaction suggests that mutations can

interactions in the dimer interface of odc
be accommodated by the incorporation of water molecules
at the site of the mutation (4, 25). additionally, the
detrimental effects of mutating a key residue in the growth
 xxxg1603xxx  could be complemented by a mutation in
the hormone that allowed for repacking of the interface (8).
the odc interface may accommodate the mutations by
similar mechanisms. structural plasticity may be particularly
important for the function of an interface that is associated
with a catalytic cycle and may be necessary for accommodation of the substrate into the interface in a catalytically
competent state.
in contrast to the limited disruptive effects caused by the
mutations of the dimer interface residues, a number of the
mutations (e36a, k69a, c114a, w356a, v392a, and
s395a) appear to strengthen the dimer. the kinetic data
suggest that the dimer may also be strengthened in the
presence of substrate. the structural basis for these effects
is not clear; however, these mutations may cause local
conformational changes that affect the electrostatic or dipole
interactions between the subunits either directly or indirectly.
in support, an analysis of interfacial hydrogen bonds and
salt bridges in protein-protein interfaces suggested that
residues involved in these interactions might not be oriented
in their global minimum conformations (26). thus mutation
of residues in the interface could cause repacking of the
interface that leads to optimization of these interactions.
the most significant effects of mutating residues in the
dimer interface were on enzyme activity. many of the largest
effects on activity of interface mutations can be ascribed to
proximity to the active site, an obvious reflection of the fact
that many of these residues play a role in the binding of
substrate or the chemistry of the reaction (17, 18). likewise,
the mutation of second-sphere residues (e.g., k169, f170,
and n398) could disrupt active site architecture and impede
catalysis. similar effects have been described in other systems
and typically involve the disruption of a hydrogen bond
network (12, 14). indeed, k169 forms a salt bridge across
the dimer interface with the backbone carbonyls of  xxxd361xxx 
and  xxxd364xxx , while f170 also makes contacts with this region.
these interactions are likely to play a key role in stabilizing
the loop that contains both c360 and  xxxd361xxx , two key active
site residues.
however, interface mutations with large catalytic consequences were not limited to the first- and second-sphere
residues of the active site. mutation of a number of peripheral
interface residues (e.g., k141, i291, k294, y317, and w356)
that are 15-20 å away from the active site significantly
reduced the catalytic efficiency of the enzyme. interestingly,
many of these residues are contained in the same region of
the interface (e.g., the backbone carbonyl of i291 and the
side chain of k141 form an h-bond across the interface).
the effects of these mutations were observed on both kcat
and km. both parameters potentially reflect multiple steps
in the reaction pathway, including schiff base formation and/
or the chemical steps of the reaction. these data provide
evidence for long-range energetic coupling of the interface
residues to the active site. taken together with the dimerization data, these data suggest that the subunit interactions
in odc are optimized for catalytic function and not for highaffinity subunit association. the data leave open the possibility that the energetic contribution of the interface residues
to dimer strength may be distributed differently in the

presence of substrate or product. in support, kinetic analysis
of the i291a mutant enzyme suggested that the dimer was
weaker than for wild-type odc, while the sedimentation data
collected in the absence of substrate did not.
the structural basis for the coupling of dimer interface
residues and the active site is likely to be subtle. x-ray
structural analysis of t. brucei odc in the absence and
presence of putrescine demonstrates that the conformational
changes that are observed upon putrescine binding are limited
to local rotational changes in two catalytic residues in the
active site. c360 rotates toward the bound ligand, and as
the schiff base between k69 and plp is exchanged for the
schiff base to substrate, k69 rotates away from the cofactor
to form new interactions (18). however, unlike what has been
observed upon binding of ligands to some enzymes [e.g.,
 xxxg631xxx  (27),  xxxg2366xxx  (28, 29),
aspartate amino transferase (30)], no domain rotations or
global repositioning of loops or structural elements have been
observed upon binding of putrescine or  xxxd1972xxx  to odc (17,
18). long-range effects on catalysis of mutating surface loop
residues in  xxxg631xxx  are related to a network
of interactions that form between these distant loops and a
mobile active site loop structure that has conformational
flexibility (14). in contrast for odc, the structural data
suggest that the propagation of small structural or electronic
changes are likely to be sufficient to account for the coupling
of catalytic efficiency to the interface energetics. orbital
overlap is thought to be a major driving force of catalysis,
and small structural changes in bonding overlap have been
demonstrated to be sufficient to cause large catalytic deficits
in enzyme-catalyzed reactions (31). likewise, dimer interface
mutations that disrupt odc activity may cause suboptimal
orientation of the pi-orbitals of the cofactor-substrate
complex, a critical factor in catalysis by plp-dependent
enzymes (32).
t. brucei odc is a drug target for the treatment of african
trypanosomiasis (16). inhibitors that could either dissociate
the dimer or bind in the dimer interface and disrupt activity
would have advantages over traditional active site directed
inhibitors. for example, protein interfaces of multimeric
enzymes do not tend to be highly conserved (33), suggesting
that greater selectivity could be obtained by targeting the
subunit interface. inhibitors that dissociate the odc dimer
might be found, but the lack of discrete regions of the
interface that drive the energetics of the interaction may limit
this approach. however, the observation that mutations in
the interface at sites distant from the active site disrupt
enzyme activity suggests that an inhibitor would not have
to dissociate the dimer to be effective. rather, a small
molecule could bind and disrupt activity by a mechanism of
induced allostery. ultimately, this latter approach may prove
to be more generally useful, since it may be easier to find
ligands that bind in the dimer interface and disrupt activity
than to identify molecules that can effectively compete and
disrupt a protein-protein interaction.
