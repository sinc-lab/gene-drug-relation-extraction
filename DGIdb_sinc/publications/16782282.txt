regulation of  xxxd3417xxx  receptors ␣, ␤ and retinoid
x receptor ␣ after sciatic nerve injury
n. zhelyaznik and j. mey*

tive processes. cell culture experiments with retina (mey
and rombach, 1999), dorsal root ganglia (corcoran and
maden, 1999) and adult spinal cord explants (corcoran
et al., 2002) indirectly support this idea. recently, ra
injections into the tibial nerve of adult rats were used to
promote nerve regeneration, and this treatment resulted in
larger numbers of regenerating axons in vivo (taha et al.,
2004). viral transfection of rar␤2 induced axonal regeneration of dorsal root ganglia neurons in vitro and, in coculture, permitted fiber growth into the spinal cord. after
crush injury of cervical dorsal roots rar␤ transfection
even led to a regenerative response with associated functional recovery of sensory functions (wong et al., 2006).
ra exerts most of its biological effects by interacting
with two families of receptors, which belong to the superfamily of nuclear hormone receptors. they are the retinoic
acid receptor (rar) family with three genes: rar␣,
rar␤, rar␥, and the retinoid x receptor (rxr) family
also including three genes, rxr␣, rxr␤ and rxr␥
(chambon, 1996). due to alternative splicing and differential promoter usage there are several isoforms for each
family member. the pleiotropic effects of retinoids in development can in part be explained by the patterns of
expression of various rar and rxr genes (mccaffery
and dräger, 2000). while less is known about the functions
of ra in the adult cns, this signaling system appears to be
important for neuronal plasticity in the hippocampus, spatial learning in mice, song acquisition in zebra finches and
synaptic function in the visual system (for review: mey and
mccaffery, 2004). we postulated that the ra system participates in peripheral nerve regeneration: all necessary
components of the ra signaling pathway are detectable in
sciatic nerves, and transcript expression and protein levels
of cellular retinol binding protein ( xxxg1938xxx ) -i and cellular
 xxxd3417xxx  binding protein (crabp) -ii are strongly upregulated after crush lesion or nerve transection (zhelyaznik et al., 2003). an additional mechanism of the regulation of ra-signaling may include changes of retinoid
receptor levels. such regulation was reported to be caused
by estrogen (han et al., 1997), interleukin (il)-1␤ (nikawa
et al., 2001),  xxxg1564xxx  (ngf) (cosgaya and
aranda, 2001), ␤-carotene (ponnamperuma et al., 2000)
and by ra itself (nikawa et al., 2001). the aim of this study
was therefore to investigate the expression of rar and
rxr in the sciatic nerve and to compare their expression
during nerve degeneration and regeneration. we identified
schwann cells and macrophages as possible targets of ra
activity and discovered lesion-induced changes in the intracellular distribution of retinoid receptors in the regenerating sciatic nerve.

abstract—cell culture experiments indicated that activation
of the  xxxd3417xxx  signaling system is involved in axonal
regeneration. this hypothesis was tested with sciatic nerve
injury in the rat. since the effect of  xxxd3417xxx  is mediated
via  xxxd3417xxx  receptors and retinoid x receptors, we investigated mrna and protein expression of these receptors
during injury-induced degeneration and regeneration. seven
days after crush injury, transcript concentrations of all  xxxd3417xxx  receptors and of retinoid x receptor ␣ were significantly higher than in non-lesioned nerves. protein levels of
 xxxd3417xxx  receptor ␣,  xxxd3417xxx  receptor ␤ and retinoid
x receptor ␣ were upregulated 4, 7 and 14 days after injury. in
degenerating nerves a significant increase of  xxxd3417xxx 
receptor ␣ was detected 7 and 14 days, and of  xxxd3417xxx 
receptor ␤ 14 and 21 days after complete transection. immunohistochemical staining of retinoid receptors revealed their
expression in schwann cells and macrophages. in addition,
we observed that  xxxd3417xxx  receptor ␣ and retinoid x
receptor ␣ appeared in the cell nuclei of macrophages during
the lesion-induced inflammatory reaction, and that retinoid x
receptor ␣-staining co-localized with some regenerating axons. experiments with schwann cell primary cultures revealed an effect of  xxxd3417xxx  on the expression of the
neuregulin receptor  xxxg722xxx , suggesting that one function of
 xxxd3417xxx  consists in the regulation of neuroglial interactions after peripheral nerve injury. © 2006 ibro. published by

 xxxd3417xxx  (ra) is an important morphogen during development of the nervous system. in hindbrain, retina,
spinal cord and neural crest– derived cells ra participates
in the regulation of cellular differentiation including neural
development and axonal growth (mccaffery and dräger,
2000; plum et al., 2001). these observations gave rise to
the hypothesis that ra may also be involved in regenera*corresponding author. tel: ⫹49-241-8024852; fax: ⫹49-241-8022133.

experimental procedures
animal experimentation and surgical procedures
a total of 43 adult male sprague–dawley rats weighing 150 –300 g
were deeply anesthetized with i.p. injection of 10% ketamine
hydrochloride (sanofi-ceva, düsseldorf, germany; 0.1 ml/100 g
body weight) and 0.1 ml rompun (bayer, leverkusen, germany).
under aseptic conditions the right sciatic nerve was exposed and
a lesion was performed. the nerve was crushed once with jeweler’s forceps for 15 s. alternatively, it was completely transected,
and the distal stump was sutured to the muscle. for easier localization of the lesion site after crush, this position was marked with
a thin thread (10 – 0), and it was always identified when preparing
the tissue. the first kind of operation caused wallerian degeneration and subsequent axonal regeneration into the distal nerve
segment. the second procedure, in contrast, prevented regeneration into the distal, degenerating nerve stump (ito et al., 1998).
after a survival period of 2, 4, 7, 14 or 21 days the animals were
killed to obtain a 1 cm nerve segment distal to the lesioned site. at
4 and 7 dies post operationem (dpo) axonal regeneration following
nerve crush and the lack of regenerating axons following complete
transection were checked immunohistochemically in the distal
nerve segment (anti-growth-associated protein 43 kda (gap43)).
contralateral nerves were used as controls. all procedures were
conducted in accordance with animal protection laws and were
approved by the regierungspräsidium köln. experiments conformed to the u.s. national institutes of health guide for the care
and use of laboratory animals. the number of rats used in this
study was kept to a minimum.
ra activity in the injured sciatic nerve was visualized with a
transgenic mouse that carries an ra-response element driving the
␤-galactosidase gene (rossant et al., 1991). four adult mice were
deeply anesthetized with avertin. their right sciatic nerves were
exposed and completely crushed, while the contralateral nerves
served as controls. after a survival period of 7 days the animals
were killed, sciatic nerves were dissected and processed for histochemical staining with the x-gal reaction (zhelyaznik et al.,
2003). experiments with mice were carried out at the shriver
center, waltham, ma, usa, and were approved by the local
animal research committee.

cell culture
primary cultures of schwann cells were prepared from newborn
sprague–dawley rats. as previously published (johann et al.,
2003) nerves were dissected, digested with collagenase, trypsin
and triturated. the cell suspension was treated with cytosine
arabinoside, and fibroblasts were eliminated with thy 1.1 antibody
and complement lysis. schwann cells were then cultured in polyl-lysine-coated flasks in dulbecco’s modified eagle medium supplemented with 10% fcs, 2 ␮m  xxxd1742xxx  and 100 ␮g/ml bovine
pituitary extract. the identity of cultivated schwann cells was
confirmed immunocytochemically using a rabbit antiserum against
s-100 (sigma s2644; 40 ␮g/ml).
for ra treatment, cells were cultivated in medium without  xxxd1742xxx . final concentrations of 0.1, 1, 10, 100 and 1000 nm all-trans
ra (stock solutions 0.1 ␮m–1 mm in  xxxd1896xxx , dmso)
were added and cells were kept in darkness for 24 or 40 h at 37 °c,
5% co2. control cells received an equal volume of dmso.

reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction
(rt-pcr)
total rna was isolated from sciatic nerves using trizol (invitrogen). five hundred nanograms of dnase-treated rna was reverse transcribed with oligo-dt-primer and omniscript reverse
transcriptase (qiagen, hilden, germany) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. pcr was performed using redtaq solu-

 xxxd1837xxx , dttp), 0.03 units/␮l redtaq polymerase, 4 mm tris–hcl,
20 mm kcl, 0.6 mm mgcl2, gelatin, stabilizers. to each readymix
aliquot 1 ␮m of sense and antisense primer was added with 25 ng
of cdna. primer sequences for rar␣, ␤, ␥, rxr␣, ␤, ␥, erbb2
and  xxxg722xxx  are listed in table 1. a range from 25 to 35 pcr cycles
was tested to determine the linear phase and saturation of the
amplification. for semiquantitative measurements, the pcr reaction parameters were: first denaturation 180 s at 94 °c, 28 cycles
of annealing 60 s at 51 °c, extension 90 s at 72 °c, denaturation
60 s at 94 °c, followed by 60 s annealing and last elongation 600 s
at 72 °c. the pcr products were separated by agarose gel
electrophoresis and stained with ethidium bromide. from fluorescence intensity data the logarithms of the signal ratios of lesioned
nerves to control nerves were calculated and tested with anova
and post hoc dunnett’s test. data from lesioned and non-lesioned
tissues were not pooled but each experimental nerve was compared with the contralateral control nerve of the same rat. thus,
independent experiments from the different animals were statistically evaluated. all mrna measurements were normalized with
the expression of glyceraldehyde phosphate dehydrogenase
( xxxg861xxx ).

quantitative pcr
to measure the relative change of erbb2 and  xxxg722xxx  mrna expression after ra treatment, quantitative pcrs were performed
by means of the roche light cycler system using the quantitect
sybr green pcr kit (qiagen) and light cycler software, version 3. reactions were carried out in 20 ␮l volume/capillary. the
experimental protocol consisted of a first denaturation 15 min at
95 °c, followed by 35– 40 cycles of annealing 20 s at 52 °c,
amplification 20 s at 72 °c, fluorescence measurement 5 s at
81 °c and denaturation 15 s at 94 °c. with every pcr amplification of erbb2 and  xxxg722xxx  mrna, the expression of  xxxg861xxx  was
used as a non-regulated control. the identity of pcr products was
confirmed with melting curve analysis and agarose gel electrophoresis. for all primer combinations, concentration series of the
extracts were run to calculate efficiency of the pcr. the pcr
efficiencies (amplification per cycle) were for  xxxg861xxx  1.65, for
erbb2 and  xxxg722xxx  2.00. for every ra concentration three to eight
independent cell culture experiments with pairs of ra- and
dmso-treated schwann cells were performed and statistically
analyzed with jmp software (sas institute). for this, logarithms of
the mrna ratios of ra treated and control cells were calculated

and corrected for differences in the extract concentrations based
on the  xxxg861xxx  analysis.

western blotting
for immunoblotting, nerves were sonicated in hypotonic buffer
with a mix of protease inhibitors. soluble protein extracts were
separated with discontinuous sodium  xxxd3215xxx  polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (sds-page) and transferred by western blotting onto a nitrocellulose membrane (bio-rad). rabbit
antisera binding to specifically rar␣, ␤ or rxr␣, ␤, ␥ were
obtained from santa cruz (sc-551, sc-552, sc-553, sc-831, sc555, all used in 1/500 dilution). a mouse monoclonal antibody was
used against rar␥ (sc-7387). indirect immunodetection was
based on peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (sigma)
and the enhanced chemiluminescence method (amersham) according to standard protocol. x-ray films (hyperfilm, amersham)
were exposed 30 s to 1 h to determine the linear range of the
signal and were then evaluated with a digital image analysis
system ( xxxg1348xxx , wasserburg, germany). equal amounts of protein
were loaded in all lanes (bca protein assay, sigma) and this was
checked by staining with ponceau-s. for quantification, the
strength of the immunoreactive bands was expressed in relation to
the contralateral side, set at 100%, and tested with anova and
dunnett’s test. as with the pcr results, each experimental nerve
was compared with the contralateral control nerve of the same
animal. western blotting experiments indicated that antisera
showed no cross-reactivity. since the rar/rxr antisera produced more than one band in the blots we confirmed the specificity of the signals by pre-absorbing the antibodies with the rar␣,
rar␤, rxr␣ and rxr␤ peptides that had been used to generate
the antisera (sc-551p, sc-552p, sc-553p, sc-831p, santa cruz;
diluted 1/50).
to test whether ra affects the expression of the neuregulin
(nrg) receptor  xxxg722xxx , protein extracts from schwann cell cultures were also investigated in immunoblots. the  xxxg722xxx  antibody
was a polyclonal rabbit antiserum purchased from santa cruz
(sc-285, working dilution 1/200).

immunohistochemistry
four, 7, 14 and 21 days following the surgery sciatic nerves were
prepared and postfixed in 4% phosphate-buffered paraformaldehyde for 1 h at 4 °c. the tissues were cryoprotected in 25%
sucrose and then sectioned longitudinally  xxxd1891xxx  ␮m with a cryostat
and dry-mounted on gelatinized slides (fisher scientific, pittsburgh, pa, usa). primary antibodies were directed against rar␣,
rxr␣ (diluted 1/100, santa cruz), rar␤ (1/50, santa cruz), p75
(1/500, chemicon), ed-1 (1/500, serotec), gap43 (1/500, abcam) and neurofilament 200 kda (nf200, recognizing the phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated forms; 1/500, sigma). for
detection we used fluorescence-labeled secondary antisera goat
anti-rabbit, conjugated with alexa-488 (1/1000, molecular probes)
and goat anti-mouse alexa-594 (1/2000, molecular probes). in the
double labeling experiments we combined polyclonal antisera
against retinoid receptors with monoclonal antibodies as cell type
markers: p75 for schwann cells (liu et al., 2005), ed-1 for activated macrophages (hu and mclachlan, 2003) and nf200 for
axons. anti-p75 schwann cell staining was corroborated with a
polyclonal serum against s100 (sigma s2644). immunohistochemical titration experiments were performed with sciatic nerve
sections. in addition, the cell nuclei were counterstained with
4=,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole dihydrochloride (dapi). to test the
specificity of the histological staining procedure, controls using
preabsorbed antibodies were performed with sections from nonlesioned and from crushed nerves at 14 dpo. for this, antisera
against retinoid receptors were incubated 2 h at room temperature
with rar␣ peptide (20 ␮g/ml), rar␤ peptide (40 ␮g/ml) and
rxr␣ peptide (20 ␮g/ml, all from santa cruz).

fluorescence microscopy
a zeiss axiophot epifluorescence microscope with digital camera
and axiovision software was used. all parameters, such as image
resolution, time of exposure, adjustment of brightness and contrast, were kept equal for each primary antibody when representing or evaluating immunoreactivity signals of different sections or
experimental conditions. controls with no or only one primary but
both secondary antibodies revealed no non-specific background
staining at these settings and no false-positive results from crossreactivities between primary and secondary antibodies nor bleedthrough into inappropriate filter sets. for quantitative assessment
of the intensity of immunostaining three sections about 3 mm
distal from the lesion site (crush or transection) of each nerve were
photographed (40⫻ objective) and the fluorescence was measured using nih image software.
cell counts after staining with dapi and ed-1, in combination
with rar␣, rar␤ or rxr␣ were performed at 4, 7, 14 and 21
days after nerve crush and in contralateral, non-injured nerves.
for each time point, two injured sciatic nerves were evaluated,
and cells were counted in three randomly chosen photographs
close to the crush site. variance was low between the sections of
one nerve. results from two nerves per time point were averaged
but not statistically evaluated.
colocalization experiments of retinoid receptors with the immunohistochemical markers p75 for schwann cells, ed-1 for macrophages and nf200 for axons were confirmed with a leica
confocal laser microscope (40⫻ objective, 4⫻ digital zoom, consecutive scanning of dapi, alexa-488 and alexa-594 excitation
and filters, sampling rate 200 hz, leica 2004 software). the
confocal microscope was also used to visualize the intracellular
localization of rar␣, rar␤ and rxr␣.

results
the present work was motivated by the hypothesis that the
ra signal transduction system is involved in nerve regeneration. western blotting experiments with protein extracts
from sciatic nerves of adult rats confirmed the presence of
rar and rxr in the peripheral nervous system (pns)
(fig. 1a). immunoreactive bands of rar␣ had an electrophoretic mobility of 43 kda, 58 kda and 79 kda. rar␤ was
detected at 41 kda, rxr␣ at 53 kda with additional bands
at 38 kda and 79 kda, and rxr␤ immunoreactivity migrated at 59 kda. to check the specificity of these signals
the antisera were preabsorbed with the respective immunogenic peptides. this control procedure abolished the
enhanced chemiluminescence signals (fig. 1a, lanes
marked ⫹p).
ra itself could not be measured with hplc in sciatic
nerve extracts, possibly due to insufficient sensitivity of the
method (zhelyaznik et al., 2003). however, analysis of a
transgenic mouse revealed ra-induced gene expression
after sciatic nerve crush. enzyme activity of the reporter
gene was not detected in the contralateral, non-injured
nerve at the same time (fig. 1b).
transcript concentrations of rar␣, rar␤, rar␥
and rxr␣ increase after sciatic nerve crush
with semiquantitative rt-pcr and western blotting we
analyzed the expression of the known rar (rar␣, ␤, ␥)
and rxr (rxr␣, ␤, ␥) at different time points after peripheral nerve injury. as published previously, the operation
consisted of a sciatic nerve crush, which severed all nerve

tive signals whose identity is not known, but whose signal
intensity correlated with the evaluated bands at 43 kda
(rar␣), 41 kda (rar␤) and 53 kda (rxr␣). minor bands
with slightly higher molecular weight indicated posttranslational modification (zimmerman et al., 2006; fig. 3a).
when comparing crushed and intact sciatic nerves we
found a strong (more than four-fold) and highly significant
upregulation of rar␣ immunoreactivity 4 and 7 days after
lesion (anova, dunnett’s test p⬍0.01; fig. 3a, b). there
were no significant changes 2 and 21 days after the lesion,
but still a moderate and significant increase 14 days after
axotomy (p⬍0.05). for rar␤, a significant upregulation of
protein was noticed for all measured time points (fig. 3a, c).
immunoreactivity rose 2 days after nerve crush and remained
above control levels for at least 3 weeks (anova, p⬍0.001,
dunnett’s test p⬍0.05). with immunoblots rar␥ was neither
detected in control, nor in crushed sciatic nerves. this is a
discrepancy from the rt-pcr data, however, we were not
able to produce a positive staining with this antibody (santa
cruz sc-7387). when we were looking at gene expression,
rar␥ amplification indicated very low levels in the normal
nerves that became stronger 7 days after crush.
the immunoreactive signal of rxr␣ was significantly
higher than in the contralateral control nerve after 7 and 14
days (p⬍0.05) and declined back to baseline 3 weeks after
fig. 1. ra signal transduction in the pns. (a) retinoid receptors are

rar␣, rar␤, rxr␣ and rxr␤ produced several immunoreactive
bands, which disappeared when the antisera were preincubated with
the respective immunogenic peptides (⫹p). (b) sciatic nerve crush
caused expression of an ra-dependent reporter gene (enzyme activity of ␤-galactosidase, blue, 7 dpo) as demonstrated in a transgenic

fibers but allowed subsequent axonal regeneration into the
distal nerve segment (ito et al., 1998). gene expression
and immunoreactivity were measured in the nerve segment 1 cm distal from the lesion site. fig. 2 shows injuryinduced changes in gene expression 7 days after lesion,
evaluated with semi-quantitative rt-pcr. sciatic nerves
contained mrna for all rar and rxr. we found that a
crush lesion induced elevated transcript levels of rar␣,
rar␤, rar␥ and rxr␣ (anova, p⬍0.05; dunnett’s test:
rar␣, rar␤, rxr␣ p⬍0.01; rar␥ p⬍0.05). there were
no significant changes in mrna levels of rxr␤ or rxr␥
(fig. 2). since mrna expression patterns do not always
predict protein expression and therefore biological activity,
we investigated changes of retinoid receptor proteins.
protein expression of rar␣, rar␤ and rxr␣ is
upregulated during sciatic nerve regeneration
for the assessment of rar and rxr proteins, extracts
from sciatic nerves were separated by sds-page and
analyzed with western blotting. consistent with the results
on gene expression, the protein levels of rar␣, rar␤ and
rxr␣ were significantly higher than in control nerves. in
addition to major rar- and rxr-bands at expected molecular sizes, the antisera detected specific immunoreac-

lesion (fig. 3d). rxr␤ protein did not change significantly,
except for a moderate increase 7 days after crush (1.6fold; p⬍0.05). in accordance with the pcr results, immunoreactivity signals of rxr␥ were not statistically different
from controls at any point in time. data are listed as supplementary material. since the crush lesion caused the
strongest significant changes in mrna and protein expression of rar␣, rar␤ and rxr␣, these three retinoid receptors were further investigated.
the histochemical staining patterns of retinoid
receptors change in the regenerating sciatic nerve
to assess protein changes in situ, longitudinal sections of
sciatic nerves 4, 7, 14 and 21 days after crush injury were
stained with the same antibodies against rar␣, rar␤
and rxr␣ as for the biochemical experiments. in addition
we co-stained the same sections with ed-1, p75 and
nf200. in accordance with the immunoblots, signals after
crush injury were stronger than in control nerves for all
three receptor molecules (fig. 4).
the most dramatic change in signal intensity was observed for rar␣ 7 days after the injury (fig. 4a– e). the
increased immunoreactivity was most pronounced at and
distal to the crush site and to a lesser degree also proximal
from the lesion. at the later time points (14 –21 days) there
were also histological changes in the staining pattern: in
non-lesioned nerves only longitudinal structures were labeled, which appeared to be either nerve fibers or the
cytosol/membranes of myelinating schwann cells. the intensity of this staining pattern increased in the regenerating nerve. in addition to these fibers, distinctly rar␣labeled cell nuclei appeared (fig. 4d, e). most of these

nuclei were observed at 14 and 21 dpo immediately distal
of the crush site and none in the proximal nerve segment.
for rar␤ (fig. 4f–j), a low signal was detected in intact
nerves. in accordance with the western blotting data, there
was only a moderate increase in the staining intensity.
however, more prominent than the mere increase after
injury, we saw a marked change in the cellular distribution
of rar␤. the crush lesion induced rar␤-immunoreactivity mostly in distinct cell somata, whose cell nuclei were
devoid of staining (fig. 4g–j). the changes in intensity and
intracellular distribution of rxr␣ resembled that of rar␣
(fig. 4k– o). in comparison with rar␣ the increase in
rxr␣ staining was less pronounced, while even more
rxr␣-immunoreactive cell nuclei appeared during the first
and second week after injury.
to check the specificity of these staining patterns,
rar␣, rar␤ and rxr␣ antisera were preabsorbed with
the respective peptides that had been used to generate the
antibodies. fig. 5(a–f) demonstrates that peptide preincubation abolished rar␣- and rxr␣-staining of longitudinal
structures and cell nuclei, as well as the rar␤-labeling of
cell bodies.
a semiquantitative assessment of the immunohistochemical staining after crush injury as well as after
complete nerve transection is shown in fig. 5 g, h. the
graphs corroborate the data obtained with western blotting. they also indicate that the lesion-induced upregulation of rar␣ and rar␤ proteins was lower when
axonal regeneration was prevented and that rxr␣ did
not increase under this condition. this was in accordance with independent biochemical experiments (described below).

expression of retinoid receptor proteins in schwann
cells and macrophages
since the patterns of retinoid receptor immunoreactivity
indicated staining of glia and macrophages, this was further investigated with double labeling experiments. the

rar␣-immunoreactive signal was localized in longitudinal
structures, resembling schwann cells. accordingly, this
signal colocalized with the p75  xxxg259xxx  (nt) receptor,
which is also expressed in schwann cells (fig. 6). at 14
and 21 days after nerve crush, rar␣ was visible in cell
nuclei as determined with dapi labeling on the same

days after crush, slightly distal from the lesion site, longitudinal staining and nuclear labeling of rar␣ (a), cell somata staining of rar␤ (b) and
longitudinal staining and nuclear labeling of rxr␣ (c) were completely prevented with the specific peptides (d–f). (g, h) strength of immunoreactivity

intensity was observed in the regenerating nerve after crush (g). changes were smaller or absent in degenerating nerve segments after transection

sections (fig. 4d– e, 6a, c). most rar␣ positive cell nuclei
were small and belonged to the ed-1 positive macrophages (fig. 7a– c).
during the time period under investigation, the specific
rar␤ labeling that was induced by the lesion largely colocalized
with ed-1 staining (fig. 7d–f). in most cells this signal was
contained in the cytosol. we also noticed some nuclear staining,
which belonged to the ed-1 positive macrophages as well.
as observed for rar␣, the rxr␣ fiber staining was
found in colocalization with the p75 receptor (fig. 6 g–i). after
crush injury, nuclear signals were again present in ed-1
positive macrophages (fig. 7 g–l). rxr␣-containing cell nuclei appeared already at 4 days after lesion. while the nuclear
location of rar␣ and rxr␣ receptors was observed mostly
in ed-1 positive macrophages, this staining pattern describes
only a subpopulation of macrophages because the majority
of these cells did not express retinoid receptors in their nuclei
(table 2). adjacent to the crush site the percentage of macrophages that contained retinoid receptors in their nuclei
reached 20% (rar␣), 17% (rar␤) and up to 45% (rxr␣).
are retinoid receptors expressed in axons?
since retinoid receptors act as ligand-activated transcription factors we did not expect their expression in axons far

from the somata of nerve cells. given the histological staining
patterns of rar␣ and rxr␣, this was nevertheless possible
and was therefore investigated with confocal microscopy using neurofilament (nf200) as a marker for axons that had
regenerated distal from the crush site (fig. 8). confirming the
interpretation based on p75 staining, the rar␣-positive
longitudinal structures were nf200-negative. in close
proximity to the axons rar␣ seemed to be contained in
the cytosol of schwann cells (fig. 8a– c for 14 dpo, distal of
the crush site). as expected, rar␤-labeled cell bodies did
not express nf200 either (fig. 8d–f). while most of the
rxr␣-positive structures were also not reacting with the
nf200 antibody and many axons were rxr␣-negative,
confocal microscopy revealed expression of this receptor
in some regenerating axons (fig. 8g–i).
increase of rar␣ and rar␤ but not of rxr␣ protein
expression after nerve transection
in addition to crush lesions we performed nerve transections and ligated the distal nerve segment to the peroneus muscle. this caused wallerian degeneration but prevented axonal regeneration into the distal nerve segment,
which was then analyzed biochemically. relative changes in
protein expression in the distal, degenerating nerve, com-

panels in c, f, i and l are superimposed photographs of two antibody staining procedures combined with dapi nuclear staining (blue). rar␣ is
expressed in longitudinal structures and some distinct cell nuclei (b, c) and is largely co-localized with p75 (a– c). rar␤ showed only weak staining
in p75 positive schwann cells (d–f). rxr␣ immunoreactivity also co-localized with p75 (g–i). experiments were performed with two animals for each
time period (4, 7, 14, 21 dpo), and with the exception of histological changes noted before, results were similar as shown here for 7 days after crush
injury. arrows point to examples of receptor staining in p75 positive schwann cells. (j–l) images of one sciatic nerve section  xxxd2274xxx  dpo obtained with

pared with the non-lesioned contralateral nerve were determined with western blotting and are presented in fig. 9.
we observed increased expression of rar␣ protein  xxxd2274xxx 
days after nerve transection (p⬍0.05). it was strongest
after 14 days (three-fold, p⬍0.01), but not different from
baseline after 21 days. rar␤ upregulation began in the
second week (three-fold, p⬍0.01) and persisted for at
least 3 weeks (two-fold, p⬍0.05). in contrast to the observations after crush injury, where axonal regeneration was
induced, the expression of rxr␣ was not significantly
affected by nerve transection at any point in time (fig. 9).
changes of rxr␤ and rxr␥ were also not observed (data
not shown). quantitative evaluation of immunocytochemistry data showed only a moderate increase of rar␣
(fig. 5h), instead there was a slight decrease in the expression of all three receptors 21 days after the injury
indicating their involvement in the earlier part of wallerian
degeneration.
if gene expression of a receptor is specifically linked to
nerve regeneration, an increase only in the crush paradigm
was expected, and this seems to be the case with rxr␣.
similarly, the changes in protein levels of rar␣ were

much more pronounced in the regenerating than in the
degenerating nerve (six-fold vs. three-fold increase). a
lasting increase of rar␤ in the distal segments of crushed
and transected nerves indicates an involvement of this
receptor in wallerian degeneration.
effect of ra on erbb2 and  xxxg722xxx  expression in
schwann cell primary cultures
the immunohistochemical pattern of rar␣/rxr␣ indicated that ra acts on schwann cells. to investigate one
possible function of ra signals, schwann cell primary
cultures were prepared from sciatic nerves (fig. 10a– d)
and treated with ra. as a potential molecular target we
looked at the expression of nrg receptors which, among
other functions, serve as a putative trigger of wallerian
degeneration (citri et al., 2003). in addition to the expression of retinoid receptors, cultured schwann cells expressed the nrg receptor  xxxg722xxx  and the erbb2 tyrosine
kinase (fig. 10e). with an antibody against  xxxg722xxx , presence of this protein was demonstrated with immunocytochemistry and western blotting (fig. 10c, f).

expressed in ed-1 positive macrophages (d–f). the pattern of rxr␣ immunoreactivity resembles that of rar␣, but more rxr␣-labeled nuclei are
found in ed-1 positive cells (g–i). experiments were performed with two animals for each time period (4, 7, 14, 21 dpo). except for histological changes
as evident in fig. 3 results of cellular localization were similar as shown here for 7 days after crush injury. arrows point to examples of receptor staining
in macrophages. (j–l) images obtained with confocal laser microscopy illustrate nuclear localization of rxr␣ in ed-1 positive macrophages  xxxd2274xxx  dpo.

erbb2 and  xxxg722xxx  were measured after exposure to five
different doses of ra. while the effect on erbb2 was not
significant (data not shown), ra caused a highly significant
increase in  xxxg722xxx  expression (anova p⬍0.001). concentrations of 0,1 nm to 10 nm ra induced a four-fold upregulation of  xxxg722xxx  (fig. 10i). higher concentrations of
100 nm and 1 ␮m ra had no significant effects.

development ra regulates differentiation of brain cells and
in some cases promotes axonal regeneration in vitro. the
activation of  xxxd3417xxx  response element (rare)-regulated gene expression in a transgenic reporter mouse after
sciatic nerve lesion indicates the involvement of ra in
traumatic processes following peripheral nerve injury (for
review: mey, 2006).
the control of ra action after pns injury may involve
different mechanisms. they include negative regulation by
1) ra-degrading enzymes, such as cytochrome p450 oxidase 26 (swindell et al., 1999), 2) compartmentalization of
ra by  xxxg1938xxx  (dong et al., 1999), and 3) competition of
orphan receptors like chick ovalbumin upstream transcription factor ii that interfere with dna-binding of the retinoid
receptors (mccaffery et al., 1999). mechanisms of positive
regulation are 1) increased ra synthesis (mey et al.,
2005), 2) changes in expression of  xxxg512xxx , which transports ra to its nuclear receptors (delva et al., 1999; budhu
and noy, 2002), or 3) of nuclear retinoid receptors, which
activate gene transcription upon ligand binding. in the
presence of ra elevated concentrations of  xxxg512xxx  and
rar/rxr may directly enhance transcriptional activity. a
strong activation of  xxxg512xxx  during wallerian degeneration was previously shown (zhelyaznik et al., 2003). the

present study focused on the expression of rar and rxr.
two paradigms were investigated: sciatic nerve crush and
transection. in the 5–10 mm segment distal from a crush
lesion, axonal regeneration is strongly progressing during
the first week after injury (fawcett and keynes, 1990;

gillen et al., 1997). at this time a moderate but significant
elevation of mrna levels of all rar and of rxr␣ was
observed. on the protein level, two rar, rar␣ and
rar␤, were upregulated 4, 7 and 14 days after crush
injury. for rar␤ significant changes were also noticed

1772

n. zhelyaznik and j. mey / neuroscience 141 (2006) 1761–1774

2 and 21 days after axotomy. the fact that rar␣ immunoreactivity was much higher in regenerating than in
degenerating nerve segments and in both cases higher
than in non-injured nerves points to possible functions of
this molecule in both processes, axonal regeneration
and wallerian degeneration. rar␤, in contrast, exhibited lasting and similarly elevated protein levels in
transected and crush-lesioned nerves, indicative of a
role in wallerian degeneration. with a commercially
available antibody (santa cruz sc-7387) rar␥ could not
be detected either in control, or in injured sciatic nerves,
however we were not able to produce a positive control
staining with this antibody.
as for rxr, immunoreactivity of all three rxr was
present in sciatic nerves. of these, transcript and protein
levels of rxr␣ were found to be induced after crush injury.
the time course of rxr␣ expression was delayed compared with that of rars, which may indicate the involvement in different processes. in contrast to rar␣ and
rar␤, we found no increase of rxr␣ protein in the degenerating nerve segment when axonal regeneration was
prevented after transection. no upregulation of rxr␤ or
rxr␥ gene expression was observed  xxxd2274xxx  days after nerve
crush. during the 3 week period investigated with western
blotting rxr␤ protein levels were raised significantly only
 xxxd2274xxx  dpo, and rxr␥ protein expression did not change
significantly. in this study, an immunohistochemical analysis was therefore limited to rar␣, rar␤ and rxr␣.
possible functions of ra signaling after nerve injury
although the regulatory functions of ra in the pns have
yet to be identified, our data indicate that schwann cells as
well as macrophages are the most likely cellular targets.
after injury a strong rar␤ label was restricted to macrophages, marked by the co-expression of ed-1. distinguishable from the immunoreactive signals in longitudinal
structures and from signals in the cytosol of macrophages
was a lesion-induced nuclear localization of retinoid receptors. for the most part rar␣ and rxr␣ positive cell nuclei
belonged to ed-1 positive macrophages. their cytosolic
compartments lacked rar␣/rxr␣ staining. although not
all cells that displayed a nuclear staining with retinoid
receptor antibodies were ed-1 immunoreactive, most appeared to be macrophages due of their morphological
appearance. indeed, other populations of resident monocytes are recognized in the pns, including ed-1 negative
but ed-2 and major histocompatibility complex-ii positive
cells (hu and mclachlan, 2003). anti-inflammatory effects
of ra, which have been found with macrophage cell cultures, constitute a possible function of ra in the context of
nerve injury. in peritoneal macrophages, ra inhibited almost completely the production of  xxxg2296xxx -␣
(tnf␣),  xxxd2738xxx  (sjöberg et al., 1992), the lipopolysaccharide-induced production of prostaglandin-e2 and expression of cyclooxigenase-2 protein, which take part in
pro-inflammatory reactions as well (kim et al., 2004). in
activated rat microglia the ra-induced reduction of tnf␣
and  xxxd2738xxx  synthase correlated with enhanced expres-

sion of rar␤, transforming growth factor-␤1 (tgf␤1) and
with inhibited translocation of nf-␬b (dheen et al., 2005).
in similar experiments il-1␤ and il-12 were reduced by
 xxxd3417xxx  (xu and drew, 2006).
some axons, distal of the crush site and labeled with
nf200 antibody were immunoreactive for rxr␣. since
this receptor functions as a nuclear transcription factor and
the labeling was observed at a long distance from neuronal
cell bodies in spinal cord or dorsal root ganglia, the significance of this finding remains obscure. however, very
recently, axonal transport of retinoid receptors was demonstrated in rat sciatic nerves (robson et al., 2005), and a
direct influence of ra on axonal growth is certainly a
possibility (wong et al., 2006; clagett-dame, 2006). since
the increase of rxr␣ immunoreactivity did not occur in the
degenerating nerve stump after transection, its regulation
appears to be connected with processes related to the
growth of axons. as noted in the introduction, support of
axonal regeneration by ra in vivo has been reported
(taha et al., 2004; wong et al., 2006). some of this may be
mediated by other cell types and may involve the activation
of rxr␣.
is ra a regulator of schwann cell differentiation?
the increased cytosolic immunoreactivity of rar␣ and
rxr␣ appeared in patterns resembling schwann cells and
colocalized with the low-affinity nt receptor p75, which
served as a schwann cell marker in the sciatic nerve. ra
may thus stimulate physiological reactions of schwann
cells. to explore this possibility we report one experiment
with schwann cell primary cultures.
while ra has been implicated in the regulation of glial
differentiation in development (mey, 2006), the regulation
of schwann cell de- and re-differentiation is an important
function after peripheral nerve injury (fawcett and keynes,
1990).  xxxg881xxx  (␤-ngr-1) and its receptors erbb2 and
 xxxg722xxx  are essential in this context. it has been suggested
that the immediate expression of ␤- xxxg881xxx  in schwann
cells after nerve injury may prevent apoptotic death (grinspan et al., 1996), stimulate their proliferation and migration and may influence the production of chemotactic cues
for macrophages which will clear myelin debris (carroll
et al., 1997; tofaris et al., 2002). the induced expression
of erbb2 and  xxxg722xxx  in response to axotomy suggests that
schwann cell responses to ␤- xxxg881xxx  are influenced by
changes in receptor density (grinspan et al., 1996). our
results point to ra as a possible modulator of this physiological response.
in a subset of breast cancer types, the application of
ra has previously been shown to regulate the expression
of  xxxg682xxx  receptors (offterdinger et al., 1998). while none of
the  xxxg682xxx  promoters contain classical retinoid response
elements, potential ap-1 sites are present in erbb2 and
 xxxg722xxx  promoters. this may explain the effects of ra,
because it can activate or inhibit c-jun/c-fos (ap-1) depending on the cell type (li et al., 1999). positive effects of
ra on ap-1 are mediated via the protein kinase c and/or
mitogen-activated protein kinase (desai and niles, 1997).
the rapid increase of ␤- xxxg881xxx  mrna at neuromuscular

n. zhelyaznik and j. mey / neuroscience 141 (2006) 1761–1774

junctions is induced by a number of regulatory factors,
such as  xxxg1614xxx , nt-4, brain-derived  xxxg1614xxx  and
glia-derived  xxxg1614xxx , which in a variety of cell
cultures are also targets of the transcriptional activity of ra
(mey, 2006). whether these and other regulatory molecules that are implicated in the schwann cell response
after nerve injury are actually under control of ra in the
pns remains to be seen.
regulation of retinoid receptor expression
the causes of increased expression of rar␣, rar␤ and
rxr␣ after axotomy are unknown. our histological data
suggest that the increase of rar␣ and rxr␣ signals is
mostly derived from schwann cells, but that the rising level
of rar␤ is caused by a massive invasion of hematogenous macrophages and not by the upregulation of gene
expression in resident cells.
with respect to the regulation of rar/rxr expression
in schwann cells, probably more than one trigger is involved. wallerian degeneration and axonal regeneration
are based on a sequence of cellular and molecular interactions, which reflect differential expression of a number of
regulatory genes. comparing the temporal expression patterns of different genes (gillen et al., 1997; boyd and
gordon, 2003) with the time course of expression of rarelated molecules, several possible candidates are obvious. they include: il-1␤, neuropoietic cytokines il-6, ciliary  xxxg1614xxx  and  xxxg1327xxx , the
nts ngf and  xxxg259xxx , epidermal
growth factor (egf) and tgf␤. it was shown previously
that ngf and egf in co-operation with ra increase rar␤
protein levels by enhancing rar␤2 promoter activity (cosgaya and aranda, 2001). il-1␤ was also reported to enhance ra induced expression of rar␤ and rxr␤ mrnas
(nikawa et al., 2001). most probably, a combination of
different cytokines and nts shapes the activity of the ra
signaling system.
whereas a nuclear localization of retinoid receptors
was noted both in regenerating and degenerating nerves,
we observed cytosolic staining in the non-injured nerves in
general and in schwann cells even after injury. this observation contradicts the standard model of ra-dependent
gene regulation, which proposes that even in the absence
of ligand rar/rxr heterodimers bind to rare on the
dna in the nucleus (weston et al., 2003). apparently, in
peripheral nerves the non-nuclear distribution of retinoid
receptors is the physiologically normal condition. a similar
pattern has recently been noticed in the spinal cord, where
neurons, astrocytes and reactive microglia cells contained
rar␣ and rxr in the cytosol. a mild contusion injury
induced the nuclear translocation of rar␣ and the rxr
into the cell nuclei of reactive macrophages and motoneurons (schrage et al., 2006). while nuclear staining of
rar␣ and rxr␣ was caused by the peripheral nerve
injury, appeared in macrophages during the first week after
lesion and increased at 14 and 21 dpo, we do not demonstrate cytosolic labeling of macrophages with these receptors in the non-lesioned nerve. therefore, it may well be

1773

that invading monocytes from the blood carry retinoid receptors in their nuclei.

conclusion
in conclusion, the lesion-induced increase in local concentrations of rar␣, rar␤ and rxr␣ and the changes in
their distribution within the sciatic nerve corroborate the
hypothesis that the ra signaling cascade participates in
the molecular regulation of physiological responses to
nerve injury.
