serotonergic neurotransmission

mirtazapine is a new antidepressant with a unique mode of action: it preferentially blocks the noradrenergic o2-auto- and
heteroreceptors held responsible for controlling noradrenaline and serotonin release. in addition, mirtazapine has a
low affinity for serotonin (5-ht);, receptors but potently blocks 5-ht, and 5-ht3 receptors. it increases serotonergic
celi-firing in the dorsal raphe and 5-ht release in the hippocampus as measured by microdialysis. these effects are
explained by noradrenergic enhancement of 5-ht cell-firing and blockade of noradrenaline-mediated inhibition of
hippocampal 5-ht release. because mirtazapine blocks 5-ht, and 5-ht;3 receptors, only 5-ht,-mediated transmission
is enhanced. the noradrenergic activation and the consequent indirect enhancement of serotonergic transmission most
probably underlie the marked therapeutic activity of mirtazapine. the blockade of 5-ht2 and 5-ht3 receptors prevents
development of the side effects associated with non-selective 5-ht activation and may contribute to the anxiolytic and
sleep-improving properties of this new compound. therefore mirtazapine can be described as a noradrenergic and specific

serotonergic antidepressant (nassa).

introduction

despite new insights into the neurobiology of depression
and the mechanisms of actions of antidepressants, the
tricyclic antidepressants (tcas) are still unsurpassed
in clinical efficacy, which is possibly related to
their non-selective interaction with noradrenergic and
serotonergic transmission (richelson and nelson, 1984;
baldessarini, 1989; potter ef al., 1991; richelson, 1991).
their severe side effects and lack of safety in overdose
stimulated the research for a new generation of safer
antidepressants with a similar efficacy, resulting in
the development of the  xxxg1357xxx   xxxg1358xxx  inhibitors
(maois) and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors
(ssris) (stahl, 1993; lejoyeux et al., 1994). while
lacking the side effects typically seen with the classical
tcas, the ssris and maois still produce clinically
relevant central and peripheral side effects in up to 40%
of patients, due to their non-selective stimulation of the
serotonin (5-ht, and 5-ht3) receptor subtypes (stokes
et al., 1993; williams et al., 1993; dubovsky, 1994;
finley, 1994; moll et al., 1995).

the new antidepressant mirtazapine is similar to
the tcas in its interaction with noradrenergic and
serotonergic transmission and overall efficacy (kasper,
1995). yet it also demonstrates the safety in over-
dose and the absence of cholinergic-, adrenergic- and

tion antidepressants (montgomery, 1995).

interactions with noradrenergic and
serotonergic receptors

neurochemical studies

neurochemical studies in vitro have shown that mirtaza-
pine differs from other clinically effective antidepres-
sants in the way it modulates noradrenergic and sero-
tonergic neurotransmission. mirtazapine does not inhibit
noradrenaline reuptake, but preferentially blocks the
presynaptic noradrenergic @-auto- and heteroreceptors,
held to be responsible for controlling noradrenaline or
serotonin release, respectively (de boer et al., 1988).
the affinity of mirtazapine for central presynaptic
qy-autoreceptors is about 10-fold higher than for
central postsynaptic and peripheral presynaptic @-
autoreceptors. furthermore, mirtazapine has a 30-fold
higher affinity for central presynaptic o&-autoreceptors
compared to central and peripheral o,-adrenoceptors
(fig. 1). taken together, the biochemical data indicate
that mirtazapine has selective &2-adrenergic antagonistic
properties with a preference for central presynaptic
(y-adrenergic auto- and heteroreceptors.

in vivo animal studies

mirtazapine has no effect on the reuptake of 5-ht
into rat striatal synaptosomes (de boer et al., 1988).
neurochemical studies have further shown that mirtaza-
pine has differential effects on serotonergic receptors,
with a low affinity for 5-ht, receptors including the
5-ht,,, 5-ht,p and 5-ht,p subtypes (fig. 1; de
boer et al., 1988, 1994a). in contrast, mirtazapine
has a high affinity for the 5-ht, receptor subtypes,
with values of approximately 8.0 for the negative
logarithm of the drug concentration causing 50%
receptor occupation (pk;) for 5-ht 4 and 5-ht2¢
receptors. the affinity for the mainly peripheral 5-ht2,
receptor is 20-fold lower than for the other two 5-ht»
receptor subtypes. mirtazapine has a high affinity for
5-ht3 receptors as measured in binding studies as well
as neurophysiological experiments (kooyman ef al.,
1994).

the a-adrenolytic properties have also been demon-
strated in vivo. muirtazapine antagonizes clonidine-
induced mydriasis in the rat with a 50% effective
dose (edso) of 1.3mg/kg intravenously and 2 mg/kg
subcutaneously (gower et al., 1988). furthermore,
taste aversion induced by mirtazapine at 0.3 mg/kg
subcutaneously was prevented by pretreatment with
the g»-adrenoceptor antagonist idazoxan (0.5 mg/kg

t. de boer

subcutaneously for 4 days), indicating that the stimulus
properties of mirtazapine and idazoxan are similar
(berendsen er al., 1995).

the interactions of mirtazapine with 5-ht receptors
were studied in vivo in experiments measuring selective
5-ht receptor subtype-mediated behaviours, such as
lower lip retraction mediated by 5-ht,, receptors,
penile erections mediated by 5-ht ¢ and head shakes
mediated by 5-ht», receptors. mirtazapine was found
to induce lower lip retraction in rats in a dose-dependent
manner with an edsg of 0.3mg/kg subcutaneously
(berendsen et al., 1995). moreover, the taste aversion
induced by mirtazapine (0.3 mg/kg subcutaneously) was
also prevented by pretreatment with the 5-ht,, agonist
8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin (8-oh-dpat),
indicating similar stimulus properties of mirtazapine
and 8-oh-dpat (berendsen ef al., 1995). these
5-ht,,a-mediated effects of mirtazapine on lower
lip retraction and in conditioned taste aversion are
indirect because mirtazapine has no affinity for s-ht,,
receptors. 5-ht»¢-mediated penile erections induced
by m-chlorophenylpiperazine were antagonized with
mirtazapine with an edso of 0.06 mg/kg subcutaneously.
mirtazapine potently antagonized quipazine-induced,
5-ht>,-receptor mediated head shakes in the rat with an
edso of 0.1 mg/kg subcutaneously. these 5-ht,- and
5-ht2¢-receptor blocking effects of mirtazapine are in
agreement with the high affinity of the compound for
the same 5-ht» receptor subtypes observed in vitro.
in conclusion, after acute treatment, mirtazapine shows
functional 5-ht,,-receptor agonistic and additional
5-ht,4 and 5-ht2¢ receptor antagonistic properties.

after repeated treatment with mirtazapine (10 mg/kg
for 10 days) the number of head shakes induced by the
mixed 5-ht>,/5-ht2¢ agonist (dl)-1-(2,5-dimethoxy-
4-iodophenyl)-2-aminopropane (doi) was significantly
reduced, whereas in the same rats the number of
penile erections was significantly increased compared to
placebo (berendsen ef al., 1995). the observed reduc-
tion in 5-ht2, receptor-mediated head shakes observed
after repeated treatment with mirtazapine suggests a
downregulation of these receptors. changes in the
balance between 5-ht»2,4 and 5-ht»¢ receptor-mediated
transmission may contribute to the therapeutic activity
of the compound (berendsen and broekkamp, 1990).

noradrenergic and serotonergic
transmission

today it is well accepted that noradrenergic neuro-
transmission is under the control of a-adrenergic
autoreceptors, which are located on the noradrenergic
cell bodies (control of firing rate) and terminals (control
of release). blockade of these receptors increases nor-

mirtazapine effects on noradrenergic and serotonergic neurotransmission

adrenergic transmission by facilitating the firing rate of
noradrenergic neurons and by increasing noradrenaline
release (baraban and aghajanian, 1980; clement ef al.,
1992; blier and de montigny, 1994; rouquier ef ai.,
1994). electrophysiological and microdialysis studies
have demonstrated that serotonergic neurotransmission
is controlled by the noradrenergic system in two ways:
firstly by activation of 5-ht cell-firing, an a;-mediated
effect, and secondly by inhibition of 5-ht release,
an q»-mediated effect (baraban and aghajanian, 1980;
mongeau et al., 1993; blier and de montigny, 1994).
the effects of mirtazapine on noradrenergic trans-
mission were studied by measuring the release of
dihydrophenylacetic acid (dopac), considered to be
a reliable measure of the activity of noradrenergic
neurons (de boer er al., 1994a; rouquier et al., 1994).
mirtazapine enhanced dopac release in agreement
with its autoreceptor-blocking effects (fig. 2; de boer
et al., 1994a and b). electrophysiological experiments
showed that mirtazapine also increases the firing
rate of noradrenergic neurons located in the locus
coeruleus (haddjeri ef al., 1995). these experiments
are in agreement with a blockade by mirtazapine of
qy-autoreceptors demonstrated in vivo and they confirm
that mirtazapine enhances noradrenergic transmission.

variance, followed by student’s ttest, two-tailed. *p<0.05,
***9<0.01.

as mirtazapine enhances noradrenaline release by
blocking ©,-autoreceptors and because it has a low
affinity for a@,-adrenoceptors, it is expected to cause
subsequent stimulation of a,-adrenoceptors located
on serotonergic cell bodies. in electrophysiological
experiments measuring the firing rate of serotonergic
neurons in the dorsal raphe, mirtazapine (10-250 pg/kg,

intravenously) enhanced the firing rate of these neurons
in a dose-dependent manner (haddjeri er al., 1994).
these experiments clearly show that the observed
enhancement of serotonergic cell-firing by mirtazapine
originates from blockade of © -autoreceptors and that
the consequent noradrenergic activation of serotonergic
cells is mediated by a)-adrenoceptors. thus mirtazapine
increases both the firing rate of noradrenergic neurons as
well as the subsequent release of noradrenaline.

serotonin release in the hippocampus is tonically
inhibited by the noradrenergic system via inhibitory
q-adrenergic heteroreceptors. by blocking these recep-
tors mirtazapine removes this inhibitory control and
increases serotonin release (fig. 3; de montigny et al.,
1994; haddjeri et al., 1995). thus mirtazapine increases
both the firing rate of serotonergic neurons as well
as the subsequent release of serotonin. this results in
enhancement of 5-ht,, mediated transmission because
mirtazapine specifically blocks 5-ht, and 5-ht3 recep-
tors. furthermore, these specific and direct 5-ht - and
5-ht3-blocking properties of mirtazapine prevent the
development of serotonin-related side effects, and may
also contribute to the anti-anxiety and sleep-improving
propertics of the compound.

™9<0.01.

in combination, the enhancement of both noradren-
ergic and 5-ht,,-mediated serotonergic transmission
most probably mediates the antidepressant properties of
mirtazapine.

affinity for other receptors

mirtazapine has a low affinity for muscarinic, cholin-
ergic and dopaminergic receptors, does not inhibit
dopamine re-uptake but has a high affinity for histamine

international clinical psychopharmacology + vol 10, supplement 4 -1995 21
h, receptors (de boer ef al., 1988). however, the
animal behavioural data do not reveal strong sedative
effects of mirtazapine (ruigt et al., 1993; andrews
et al., 1994). this observation has been confirmed
in human volunteers as well as in depressed patients
(ruigt et al, 1990; sitsen and zivkov, 1995). the
most probable explanation is the activation of the
noradrenergic system caused by mirtazapine, which has
an arousal effect. this &-mediated alerting effect may
functionally compensate for the anti-histamine-related
sedative potential of mirtazapine. in addition, the
peripheral a&-adrenolytic properties of mirtazapine are
moderate and the ratio of its affinities for peripheral
qy- and a ,-adrenoceptors is close to 1. this probably
explains why mirtazapine has minimal cardiovascular
side effects in contrast to more selective @;- or
@»-adrenoceptor antagonists (dickinson, 1991).

thus it seems likely that the o)-adrenolytic properties
of mirtazapine are sufficiently low to permit enhance-
ment of 5-ht transmission in the central nervous
system, a consequence of its 30-fold higher selectiv-
ity for presynaptic o-adrenoceptors. in contrast, the
equivalent affinity of mirtazapine for peripheral @,- and
(2-adrenoceptors may prevent prominent cardiovascular
side effects.

conclusions

mirtazapine is a selective o-adrenoceptor antagonist
with preference for central presynaptic @ -auto- and
heteroreceptors. it enhances noradrenergic transmission
by blocking o-adrenergic autoreceptors and increases
noradrenergic cell-firing and noradrenaline release.
mirtazapine enhances serotonergic transmission via two
synergistic mechanisms: an increase in 5-ht cell-firing
and a facilitation of 5-ht release. only 5-ht, a-medi-
ated neurotransmission is enhanced, because 5-ht)
and  xxxg1116xxx -mediated effects are specifically
blocked.

therefore mirtazapine can be best described as a

noradrenergic and specific serotonergic antidepressant
(nassa).
