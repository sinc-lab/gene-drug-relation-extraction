abstract: opioids are commonly used analgesics in clinical practice. three opioid receptors (µ, delta and kappa) that mediate
opioid effects have been identified by molecular cloning. each type of opioid receptors consists of subtypes of receptors
as suggested by pharmacological studies. although µ opioid receptors are the major receptor to mediate the analgesic
effects of opioids, delta and kappa receptors are also important in anti-nociception (for example, delta and kappa receptors can mediate
spinal analgesia).
recently, the cytoprotective effects of opioids have been recognized. the presence of opioids during harmful events such
as ischemia reduces cell injury in multiple organs including heart and brain. these effects appear to be mediated by delta
receptors in most studies. a new form of cytoprotection in which a prior exposure to opioids renders protection against
cell ischemia (opioid preconditioning) has been identified. in the heart, this opioid preconditioning-induced protection has
been well documented by multiple studies and may be mediated by delta receptors, gi/o proteins, protein kinase c, atpsensitive potassium channels and free radicals. our initial study suggests that opioid preconditioning also induces
neuroprotection. this neuroprotection involves delta1 receptors, mitochondrial atp-sensitive potassium channels and free
radical production.
in this review, we will briefly describe the analgesic effects of opioids. we will focus our discussion on opioid
preconditioning-induced protection and its mechanisms. opioids and agents that specifically work on the signaling
molecules for opioid preconditioning-induced protection may prove to be useful in inducing protection against ischemia in
clinical practice.

key words: opioids, opioid receptors, analgesia, ischemia-reperfusion injury, cardioprotection, neuroprotection,
preconditioning.
introduction
opioids are naturally occurring alkaloids or related
synthetic/semi-synthetic drugs that interact with opioid
receptors to produce pharmacological effects. morphine is a
commonly used opioid in clinical practice and remains the
standard of comparison for new opioid agonists [1]. the
analgesic properties of opioids have long been known and
are the major clinical application for these drugs. in addition,
several potential new applications for morphine and opioid
agonists have been under investigation in recent years. this
article will review the analgesic effects of opioids and
discuss some of their potential applications related to cytoprotection and preconditioning against hypoxic, ischemic or
ischemia/reperfusion-induced injury.
opioid receptors
in 1973, three independent teams of investigators described the presence of opioid receptors in the central nervous
system (cns) [2]. currently, the opioid receptors are
classified into three types: µ, kappa and delta opioid receptors [3, 4].
morphine is an agonist for all three types of opioid receptors
[3]. pharmacological studies suggest that each type of opioid
receptor consists of 2 to 3 subtypes (reviewed in [4]).

for example, at least two subtypes of delta opioid receptors, delta1
and delta2, are hypothesized to exist based on the selectivity of
agonists and antagonists: deltorphine i and 2-methyl-4a-alpha(3-hydroxyphenyl)-1,2,3,4,4a,5,12,12a-alpha-octahydroquinolino
[2,3,3-g]isoquinoline (tan-67) are selective agonists for delta1
receptors, 7-benzylidenenaltrexone (bntx) is a selective
antagonist for delta1 receptors, deltorphine-d is a selective agonist for delta2 receptors, and naltriben is a selective antagonist
for delta2 receptors [4-6]. however, molecular cloning has found
only one cdna clone for each type of the three opioid
receptors and no molecular cloning evidence supports the
existence of opioid receptor subtypes [4]. this apparent
discrepancy suggests that the various opioid receptors may
not originate from separate genes but arise from posttranslational modifications. furthermore, a theory of receptor
dimerization may explain the incongruity [4]. for example,
kappa/ xxxg1632xxx  heterodimers may represent a  xxxg1633xxx 
subtype [7] and delta/µ complex may be the delta2 opioid receptor
described via functional and pharmacological studies [4].
formation of kappa/µ, delta/delta, and kappa/kappa dimers has also been
suggested, although functional link of these complexes to
particular subtypes has not been determined [4]. thus, the
subtypes of opioid receptors may in fact represent different
opioid receptor complexes [4].
studies have revealed that the opioid receptors are g
protein-coupled (gi and/or go) receptors [2]. the activation
of opioid receptors induces changes in two major
intracellular second messenger systems via gi/o proteins: 1)
inhibition of adenylate cyclase and 2) activation of

phospholipase c [3, 8-10] (fig. 1). inhibition of adenylate
cyclase results in reduced adenosine 3’, 5’-cyclic monophosphate (camp) that may underlie opioid-induced modulation of the release of neurotransmitters such as  xxxg2240xxx 
[3]. phospholipase c activation produces diacylglycerol
(dag) and inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate (ip3) from phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate. ip 3 then mobilizes intracellular
calcium (ca2+) that, along with dag, activates protein
kinase c (pkc) (fig. 1). at least 11 isozymes of pkc have
been identified. they are classified into three groups:
conventional pkcs (cpkc) (alpha, betai, betaii, and gamma), novel pkcs
(npkc) (delta, epsilon, eta, and theta), and atypical pkcs (apkc) (zeta and
iota/lambda) [11]. all isozymes have a c-terminal catalytic domain
with atp, substrate binding domains and an n-terminal
regulatory domain, which is autoinhibitory [11]. the activity
of both cpkc and npkc isozymes is regulated by phorbol
esters, dag and phospholipids. the cpkc isozymes require
ca2+ for activity, whereas npkc and apkc isozymes are
ca2+-independent [12]. the apkc isozymes are not activated
by dag [12].
activation of opioid receptors also inhibits voltagedependent ca2+ channels and activates inwardly rectifying
k+ channels [3]. these effects are thought to be important
for opioids to reduce cell excitability and to inhibit
neurotransmitter release. since the effects of opioids on ca2+
and k + channels are blocked by pertussis toxin, gi/o proteins
may also be involved in these effects (fig 1) [3].
classic analgesic effects
opioids interact with opioid receptors for their analgesic
effects. opioid receptors are present throughout the nervous
system, the heart and peripheral tissues. expression levels
and distribution of opioid receptors vary among the different
organs and between different species. for example, several

barry and zuo

investigators have identified delta and kappa, but not µ opioid
receptors in rat myocytes [13]. although all opioid receptor
types are involved in anti-nociception, studies of µ-knockout
mice have shown that the analgesic effects of morphine
occur predominately through µ-receptors [14, 15]. indeed,
morphine has a high affinity for the µ receptor (ki at ~2
nm), but it can also interact with delta and kappa receptors to a lesser
degree (ki at high nm level) [3]. interestingly, the analgesic
effects induced by  xxxg1632xxx  agonists are also
reduced in µ-knockout mice [14], consistent with the idea
that heterodimers of the opioid receptor units may be the
molecular basis for the subtypes of opioid receptors. this
phenomenon may also be an example of the cross-talk
believed to occur between delta and µ opioid receptors, with delta
agonists having shown both positive and negative modulatory effects on morphine µ receptor activity [16].
after binding to their receptors, opioids produce analgesia by several mechanisms. in the cns cells, they decrease ca2+ and increase k+ currents. decreased ca2+ influx
results in decreased presynaptic neurotransmitter release,
while enhanced k+ efflux results in postsynaptic membrane
hyperpolarization and decreased transmission of pain information. opioids also inhibit  xxxd2177xxx  (gaba)mediated transmission in local circuits such as in the brain
stem, thereby preventing gaba inhibition of descending
inhibitory pain pathways [17]. in the dorsal root ganglion
cells, opioids inhibit ca2+ currents, but have varying effects
on k+ currents depending on opioid concentration [18, 19].
opioid receptors are also present in peripheral sensory nerve
endings and their expression has been shown to be up
regulated in inflammation. during inflammation, endogenous opioids secreted by immune cells bind to these
peripheral receptors to inhibit the excitability of sensory
nerves or to block the ca2+-dependent release of excitatory

opioids

neurotransmitters (such as  xxxg2240xxx ) (reviewed in [20]).
thus, opioids interact with opioid receptors throughout the
nervous system to produce anti-nociception through
regulation of excitability of a neuronal pathway or
modulation of neurotransmitter release.
differing responses to painful stimuli and efficacies of
opioids in pain management exist among humans and also
among animals. it has been suggested that polymorphisms
and variations in expression of the opioid receptors,
especially the µ receptors, may account for this variability in
individual responses to pain and to opioids [21].
cytoprotective effects
traditionally, the clinical application of opioid receptor
agonists has been related to their efficacy in the treatment of
pain. recent evidence suggests that opioids also induce
cytoprotective effects. under ischemic conditions, interruption of blood supply causes progressive damage of metabolically active tissues as atp is depleted, which leads to a
detrimental increase in intracellular ca2+ levels and the production of free radicals. restoration of blood flow, although
essential for cell survival, can cause additional tissue injury
through further cytosolic calcium accumulation and free
radical release. the term “ischemia-reperfusion (i-r) injury”
includes both types of damage that are not easily distinguishable from each other.
a role for opioid receptor ligands in ir injury has been
implied for some time. early studies reported that systemic
treatment with high doses of the pan opioid receptor antagonist naloxone could improve post-ischemic neurological
function in humans [22, 23] and animals [24-26]. however,
this neuroprotective role of naloxone could not be confirmed
in other in vivo studies with human and animal subjects [2729]. in fact, subsequent work suggests that activation, rather
than inhibition, of opioid receptors during ischemia or
hypoxia attenuates i-r and hypoxic injury in the brain.
hayward et al. found that subcutaneously administered
enadoline, a  xxxg1633xxx  agonist, reduced brain damage
(infarction and swelling) after focal cerebral ischemia in rats
[30]. the reasons for such conflicting in vivo results are not
known. however, opioid receptor agonists or antagonists
applied systemically at high doses may act on multiple
opioid receptors and may induce responses other than
changes of cell tolerance to ischemia (such as vasodilation or
vasoconstriction around the ischemic site) [31]. thus, the
outcome after application of these agents in in vivo ischemia
models represents the sum of these effects. to avoid
potential confounding effects from systemic opioids, xia and
colleagues applied opioid agents directly to cultured neurons
and showed that activation of the delta opioid receptors, but
not µ or kappa receptors, during periods of insult protects rat
neocortical neurons against glutamate- and hypoxia-induced
injury [32, 33].
the cytoprotective effect of opioids against hypoxia or
ischemia has also been observed in other organs. for
example, the administration of  xxxg1632xxx  agonists
prolonged survival time during severe whole body hypoxia
in mice [34]. in a canine model, hibernation induction trigger
(hit) and d-ala2-d- xxxg2329xxx -enkephalin (dadle), two delta
opioid agonists, increased the duration of preserved organ

current pharmaceutical design, 2005, vol. 11, no. 10 1345

survival under normothermic conditions prior to organ
transplantation [35, 36]. dadle also showed a protective
effect against ischemic injury in a hypothermic rat lung
preservation model [37] and a normothermic rat hepatocyte
model [38]. interestingly, morphine attenuated rat small
intestinal mucosal injury after i-r [39], but did not induce
protection against renal ischemia [40]. the cardioprotective
effects of various opioid receptor agonists have been
reviewed in detail (reviewed in [41-43]). in brief, most
studies suggest that delta opioid agonists are protective against a
variety of i-r-induced myocardial injuries including infarction and stunning. for example, dadle and hit improved
post-ischemic ventricular function in isolated rabbit hearts
[44] and morphine and dadle improved function in
isolated swine hearts [45]. thus, the presence of opioids
during various detrimental insults has been shown to be
cytoprotective in several organs.
preconditioning effects
in addition to cytoprotection, where the presence of
opioids during periods of harmful insults such as ischemia
protects cells from injury, “preconditioning” refers to a prior
“treatment” that induces cell protection against a subsequent
lethal event. “ischemic preconditioning (ipc)”, therefore,
refers to a short ischemic insult that is not severe enough to
cause cell injury but induces ischemic tolerance. similarly,
“opioid preconditioning (opc)” refers to a prior exposure to
opioids that protects against a subsequent severe i-r event.
preconditioning before ischemia presents unique features: it
prepares cells before the insult and may initiate prophylactic
events against ischemia-induced pathogenic processes. two
phases of protection occur after preconditioning: acute and
delayed phases. the acute phase is present within minutes
and disappears a few hours later. the delayed phase develops
hours after the preconditioning event and can be sustained
for several days. interestingly, the timing and duration of
each phase vary between species and organ systems.
ipc has been described in many species, including pigs,
rabbits, dogs, rats, ferrets, and possibly humans. although
many endogenous chemical mediators such as kinins,
prostaglandins, adenosine and catecholamines have been
implicated in mediating the cardioprotection produced by
ipc, schultz et al. were the first to show that the endogenous
opioid system might be involved in the phenomenon. they
found that naloxone blocked the cardioprotective effects of
ipc in rats [46]. similar results supporting opioid receptor
involvement in ipc were obtained in rabbits [47]. schultz et
al. subsequently demonstrated that exogenous morphine
administration (opc), in the absence of ipc, could induce
protection against myocardial infarction in rats [48].
morphine also effectively preconditioned rabbit hearts [49].
opc has since been demonstrated in a variety of in vivo and
in vitro animal models of two important organs: heart and
brain.

heart
the majority of research into opioid involvement in ipc
thus far has been in the realm of cardioprotection. schultz

and colleagues [50], using an intact rat heart model, showed
that the acute phase of ipc-induced protection was mediated
by the delta1 opioid receptors because the ipc-induced protection was attenuated by bntx (a delta1 receptor antagonist), but
not by naltriben (a delta2 receptor antagonist), beta-funaltrexamine
(beta-fna, a µ receptor antagonist) or nor-binaltorphimine
(nor-bni, a  xxxg1633xxx  antagonist). however, using cultured
rat myocytes, wu et al. [51] showed that mild metabolic
inhibition (glucose deprivation)-induced delayed phase of
protection was inhibited by nor-bni, but not by µ and delta
receptor antagonists, suggesting the involvement of kappa opioid
receptors in glucose deprivation-induced cardioprotection.
not only is the endogenous opioid system involved in
ipc, exogenous opioids are also found to induce preconditioning effects. initial evidence that opc induced protection came from two groups led by gj gross and tm wong,
respectively. in an in vivo rat heart model, gross’s group
showed that tan-67 induced a delayed phase of cardioprotection and that this protection was inhibited by bntx,
indicating that the activation of delta1 receptors induces
cardioprotection [52]. however, wong’s group showed that
u50,488h induced a delayed phase of protection in cultured
rat myocytes and that nor-bni blocked this protection,
suggesting that activation of kappa receptors is also protective
[51]. to further support the involvement of kappa receptors, cao
et al. [53] showed that cardioprotection induced by met5enkephalin, a peptide agonist for opioid receptors, was
inhibited by a  xxxg1633xxx  antagonist. in a fourth study,
gross’s group treated chick cardiac myocytes with morphine
for 5 minutes followed by an incubation in morphine-free
media (10 minutes) before ischemia was induced. the
survival rate of morphine-pretreated cells was higher than
that of control cells [54], suggesting that morphine preconditioning induced an acute phase of cardioprotection. these
results, along with the results from wong’s group, suggest
that opioids can directly precondition cardiac myocytes
(without the need of coronary vasculature) against ischemia.
interestingly, different animal species may require activation of different opioid receptors to induce preconditioning
in the heart. in contrast to the importance of delta1 receptors in
rat hearts indicated by gross’s group, sigg et al. showed that
d-pen2-d-pen2-enkephalin (dpdpe), a delta agonist, and
deltorphan-d, a delta2 selective agonist, reduced infarct size in
swine hearts. dadle in this study did not confer any
improvement in post-ischemic function or infarct reduction
[55]. in swine heart, dadle pretreatment was potentially
arrhythmogenic [55]; whereas pretreatment with tan-67, a
delta1 selective agonist, had potent antiarrhythmic effects in rats
during i-r injury [56]. preconditioning with kappa-opioid
receptors was pro- and anti-arrhythmic in rats (biphasic
effect) [57]. however, in swine the proarrhythmic effects of
dadle preconditioning were attenuated by kappa-opioid
receptor blockade [58]. consistent with these results,
preconditioning swine heart with pentazocine, a kappa and partial
µ receptor agonist, also led to increased ischemia-induced
arrhythmias, suggesting that  xxxg1633xxx  activation
prior to ischemia is proarrhythmic in swine [58]. these
apparent species differences in outcome after activation of
different opioid receptor types caution us in extrapolating
preconditioning results from one species to another.

barry and zuo

elucidating the intracellular signaling molecules that are
involved in cardiac preconditioning after activation of opioid
receptors has received a great deal of attention. schultz et al.
showed that opioids, via gi/o protein-linked mechanisms,
induced cardioprotection that is inhibited by atp-sensitive
potassium (katp) channel inhibitors [50]. miki et al. found
that opc induced by morphine in the rabbit myocardium is
mediated by protein kinase c (pkc) [49]. the importance of
pkc in opc is supported by several other studies [5, 59,
60]. activation of pkc increases the activity of katp
channels in ventricular myocytes. in an in vivo rat model,
fryer et al. subsequently showed that mitochondrial katpchannels (present in the inner mitochondrial membrane),
rather than sarcolemmal katp-channels (present in the
surface membrane), are likely the important end effectors of
delta1 opioid receptor-mediated cardioprotection [56]. multiple
other studies support the role of mitochondrial k atp channels
in the opc-induced cardioprotection [5, 54, 60, 61]. as with
the antinociceptive mechanism of opioids, this alteration of
potassium currents hyperpolarizes cell membrane and
decreases its excitability. thus, opioid receptor activation
appears to initiate an intracellular signaling pathway via
opioid receptor-associated g-proteins, pkc and mitochondrial katp channels (fig. 2).

for opioid preconditioning-induced cardioprotection. pkc: protein
kinase c.
indicates that the mediators are not known yet.

although oxygen free radicals can be deleterious and
contribute to i-r cell injury, small amounts of free radicals
also appear to play a role in ipc- and opc-induced
cardioprotection. in chick cardiomyocytes [62] and rabbit
hearts [63], free radical production appears to mimic ipc.
radicals such as  xxxd2298xxx  and hydroxyl ions have
been shown to activate pkc-epsilon and open mitochondrial katp
channels [64]. with regards to opc, mcpherson et al.
showed that morphine or bw373u86 (a  xxxg1632xxx  agonist)
administration to isolated chick cardiomyocytes resulted in
an increase of mitochondrial free radical production that is
correlated with decreased cell death after in vitro simulated
ischemia and reperfusion. the increase in free radical pro-

opioids

duction was abolished by an antioxidant (2-mercaptopropionyl glycine), a pan opioid receptor antagonist (naloxone),
a delta1 receptor antagonist (btnx), and a mitochondrial
selective  xxxg1253xxx  blocker (5-hydroxydecanoate) [61].
recent data suggests that the free radicals generated after
morphine preconditioning in chick cardiomyocytes may be
 xxxd2738xxx  synthesized by  xxxd2738xxx  synthases. nitric
oxide may activate pkcdelta to mediate cardioprotection [59].
in addition, pkc, mitochondrial katp channels and free
radicals may be involved in a positive feedback loop, with
free radicals activating pkc and katp channels, and activated katp channels inducing free radical production (fig. 2)
[59].
the importance of pkc, free radicals and katp channels
in the delayed phase of opc-induced cardioprotection has
also been suggested. tan-67 produced delayed cardioprotection in rats when administered at 1 hour or 24 - 48
hours, but not at 12 or 72 hours, prior to ischemia. this
protective effect involved mitochondrial katp channels as
well as extracellular signal-regulated kinase and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase activation [52, 65]. patel et al.
showed that antioxidants eliminated the ability of
bw373u86 to reduce infarct size in rats 24 hours after
treatment. however, bntx, a delta1 antagonist, did not entirely
block the effects of the  xxxg1632xxx  agonist, suggesting that the
delta1 opioid receptor may not be solely responsible for delayed
opc [66]. kodani et al. found that bw373u86 administration induced a delayed phase of protection against
myocardial stunning and infarction in rabbits and that this
protection was blocked by bntx and by  xxxg1884xxx 
inhibitors, indicating that the delta1 opioid receptor and  xxxg1884xxx  are involved in the delayed phase of opc [67].
wu et al. showed that u50,488h induced a delayed preconditioning effect at 16 - 20 hours after administration in rat
myocytes and that this protection was attenuated by inhibiting pkc [51]. thus, opc may involve similar intracellular
signaling molecules to mediate acute and delayed cardioprotection. however, the longer duration of delayed cardioprotection may prove to be more clinically useful.
in addition to the intracellular mechanisms to induce
ischemic tolerance in cells, opioid-induced cytoprotection
and preconditioning effects may involve interference with
the functions of adhesion molecules responsible for
neutrophil and endothelial cell activation. neutrophils tend
to adhere to injured endothelium and extravasate into sites of
i-r injury. they are thought to cause further ischemic
damage by microvascular obstruction and generation of
cytotoxic cytokines, free radicals, and other proinflammatory
substances. wang et al. have shown that both morphine and
morphine preconditioning, independent of pkc and katp
channels, can attenuate neutrophil adhesion and activation in
rat models of acute myocardial infarction. in these studies,
morphine reduced plasma levels of circulating adhesion
molecules such as intercellular adhesion molecule-1, lselectin, and gp100mel14 during cardiac ischemia and
reperfusion [68, 69]. use of monoclonal antibodies against
adhesion molecules has been shown to significantly reduce ir injury [42]. thus, decreased neutrophil-endothelium
activation by morphine treatment may be an additional
mechanism by which opioids reduce injury.

brain
various authors have reported ipc neuroprotection from
gerbil and rats in vivo, brain slices, and cultured neurons
(reviewed in [70]). multiple mechanisms including activation of glutamate receptors, adenosine receptors, katp
channels,  xxxd2738xxx  synthesis, pkc and calcium have been
suggested to be involved in ipc of the brain (reviewed in
[71, 72]). evidence also suggests that the endogenous opioid
system is involved in the neuroprotective effects of ipc and
that morphine can produce preconditioning in the brain just
as in the heart. rubaj et al. [73] showed that a short exposure
(5.5 min) to hypoxia reduced convulsions induced by
pentylenetetrazol 30 min, 24 hr, 4 days, and 7 days later in
mice. morphine mimicked this hypoxic preconditioninginduced neuroprotection by attenuating pentylenetetrazolinduced seizures. naloxone, (-)-n-(cyclopropylmethyl)-4,14dimethoxymorphinan-6-one (a µ receptor antagonist), and
nor-bni were able to block both hypoxic and morphine
preconditioning-induced protection, suggesting that the µ
and kappa opioid receptors are involved in this antiseizure effect
[73]. more recently, morphine preconditioning has been
shown to reduce rat purkinje cell death after in vitro simulated ischemia and reperfusion applied 30 min after morphine
pretreatment. this acute phase of neuroprotection was
inhibited by bntx, but not by beta-fna, nor-bni or naltriben,
suggesting the involvement of delta1 opioid receptors in the
effects. in addition, mitochondrial katp channels and free
radical production were implicated in the effects of the study
[74]. limited information exists regarding the signaling
molecules involved in opc-induced neuroprotection.
however, these initial studies suggest that the mechanisms
may be similar to those that produce cardioprotection.
studies in humans
the studies discussed in the previous sections of this
review regarding opc-induced protection were performed in
various animal models. thus, it is not appropriate to extrapolate these results directly to humans. however, there is
some data to suggest that opc also induces cardioprotection
in humans. tomai et al. [75] showed that naloxone blocked
ischemia-induced adaptation of myocardium during coronary
balloon angioplasty in humans, indicating that the endogenous opioid system is involved in the protection. bell et al.
[76], using human atrial trabeculae, showed that both
hypoxia and dadle induced an acute phase of protection
and this protection was blocked by naltrindole, a  xxxg1632xxx 
antagonist, and 5-hydroxydecanoate, a mitochondrial katp
channel antagonist. these results suggest that similar
signaling molecules are involved in opc-induced protection
in both human and animal myocardium.
there are two studies regarding ipc effects on human
brains in the literature [77, 78]. both studies found that prior
transient ischemic attacks in the ipsilateral brain are
associated with better neurological outcome after an ischemic stroke, suggesting that ipc-induced neuroprotection
exists in humans. as of yet, there are no human data to
suggest that the ipc-induced neuroprotection involves the
endogenous opioid system or that opc induces neuroprotection.

conclusion

analgesia has been the main indication for the use of
opioids. however, as a growing body of evidence suggests
that the opioid system is involved in the protective effects of
ischemic preconditioning and that morphine and other
opioids can mimic ischemic preconditioning to induce
protection in several organs, new clinical uses for opioids
may be on the horizon. preconditioning has clear advantages
over intra-ischemic intervention (cytoprotection) in that it
aims to block pathogenic processes before they have started.
potentially, opioids that are already used in cardiac anesthesia
due to their potent analgesic effects and cardiovascular
stability could eventually be utilized to confer protection
against a variety of anticipated ischemic insults such as
cardiopulmonary bypass during heart surgery. neurosurgery
and neuroanesthesia may also benefit from this potential to
provide pharmacological prophylaxis before ischemic brain
injury can occur. improving organ preservation could potentially reduce acute allograft failure and allow for prolonged
organ storage prior to transplantation. thus, preconditioning
with opioid agonists to produce periods of protection without
involving noxious stimuli such as ischemia is of great
clinical interest.

the studies of opc-induced protection in the heart and
the brain have revealed the involvement of delta opioid receptors, pkc, mitochondrial katp channels and free radicals in
this protection. specific targeting of these molecules may
represent opportunities for pharmaceutical design to reduce
