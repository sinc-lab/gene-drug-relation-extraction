abstract
the aim of this study was to evaluate the predictive value of ﬁve diﬀerent biological factors in breast cancer patients treated with
neoadjuvant anthracycline-based chemotherapy: (1) tumour grade scored according to the elston–ellis classiﬁcation, (2) hormonal
receptor (hr) status; (3) tumour cell proliferation evaluated by ki-67 staining, (4) her-2 and  xxxg2312xxx  alpha (topoiia)
expression evaluated by immunohistochemistry (ihc), (5) her-2 and topoii ampliﬁcation evaluated by real-time polymerase
chain reaction (pcr). 119 patients with operable breast cancer were treated with six cycles of fec (100 5-ﬂuorouracil (5-fu) 500
mg/m2,  xxxd2008xxx  100 mg/m2, cyclophosphamide 500 mg/m2). tumour response was assessed clinically and by computed tomography (ct) scan, then by pathological assessment. the clinical overall response (or) was 80%, with 19% of complete responders
(cr). the radiological or was 71%, with 16% of cr. a pathological cr was demonstrated in 13% of the patients according to
the sataloﬀ classiﬁcation. in the multivariate analysis, the absence of hr expression and ki-67520% were predictive for a clinical
cr. a high tumour grade was predictive for a pathological cr. overexpression or ampliﬁcation of her2 or topollc were not
predictive of response.

1. introduction
as the clinical and pathological responses of breast
cancer to neoadjuvant chemotherapy are short-term
markers for a long-term outcome [1,2], it is important to
identify accurately biological factors that may predict
the response to neoadjuvant therapy. these factors
should identify patients who will beneﬁt most from

treatment, and spare patients from the toxicity of treatment that is known to be ineﬀective. these factors could
also provide mechanistics insights into understanding
tumour biology. recent retrospective studies have suggested a correlation between her2 overexpression and
a beneﬁt from anthracycline therapy [3,4], but a biological mechanism linking her2 overexpression to
anthracycline sensitivity is lacking.  xxxg2312xxx 
alpha (topoii) is localised close to her2 on chromosome 17 q12-q21 and the enzyme is a molecular target
for anthracyclines [5]. because of the physical proximity
to her2, topoii is frequently co-ampliﬁed with
her2 in breast cancer [6]. this co-ampliﬁcation could

206

provide a plausible explanation for the link between
her2 overexpression and anthracycline response.
in the present study, the role of tumour grade, hormonal
receptors (hr), ki-67, her-2 and topoiia status as predictive markers of response to neoadjuvant anthracyclinebased chemotherapy was evaluated in primary tumour
specimens from 119 patients with breast carcinomas.

2. patients and methods
2.1. patient and tumour characteristics
all patients with operable breast cancer and treated
between january 2000 and december 2001 at the paul
strauss center with neoadjuvant anthracycline-based
chemotherapy were included in this retrospective study.
neo-adjuvant chemotherapy was indicated when the
largest tumour diameter was equal to or larger than 20
mm. patients with a primary inﬂammatory carcinoma
or with a long clinical history of neglected tumour in
breast were excluded. a microbiopsy was performed
before the chemotherapy treatment to allow a pathological diagnosis and evaluation of biological parameters.
all tumours were adenocarcinomas. patients received
six cycles of an anthracycline-based therapy (5-ﬂuorouracil (5-fu) 500 mg/m2,  xxxd2008xxx  100 mg/m2,
cyclophosphamide 500 mg/m2, on day 1 of a 21-day
cycle). no patient received tamoxifen as part of her
neoadjuvant treatment. patients were scheduled to
undergo surgery 4 weeks after the sixth cycle with
tumour excision and axillary node dissection. table 1
shows the patient and tumour characteristics.
2.2. assessment response
assessment of the tumour response was undertaken
by bidimensional clinical and computed tomography
(ct) measurements both prior to chemotherapy treatment and after six cycles, but before surgery. the clinical baseline and preoperative measurements were
obtained with a caliper by the same medical oncologist.
clinical and radiological responses were recorded
according to the international union against cancer

(uicc) criteria: a complete response (cr) indicating
the disappearance of the primary tumour; a partial
response (pr) indicating a reduction of 550%; stable
disease (sd) indicating a reduction of < 50% or
increase in size of < 25%; progressive disease (pd)
indicating an increase in size of 525%.
the pathological cr was evaluated by tumour excision
and axillary node resection after six cycles of chemotherapy. two experienced breast pathologists looked at
all samples. two grading classiﬁcations were utilised to
evaluate the tumour response after chemotherapy. in
the chevallier classiﬁcation, the absence of invasive
tumour cells, or persistence of in situ disease, and negative axillary lymph nodes deﬁne a pathological cr [7].
in the sataloﬀ classiﬁcation, we have similar criteria for
a pathological cr, but also observe the persistence of
small clusters of widely dispersed cells in these cases [8].
2.3. evaluation of pathological factors
five diﬀerent pathological factors were determined on
the initial microbiopsy and studied as predictive factors
in a single laboratory (centre paul strauss): tumour
grade, tumour cell proliferation evaluated by ki-67
staining [9], hr, her2 and topoiia status (table 2).
all slides were reviewed by the two pathologists without
knowledge of the treatment response.
the tumour grade was scored according to the
elston–ellis classiﬁcation on a scale of 1–3 [10].
the four other pathological factors were evaluated by
immunohistochemistry (ihc). reagents used for ihc
studies are listed in table 3. 3-mm sections from formalin-ﬁxed, paraﬃn-embedded tissues were cut and
mounted on positively-charged slides. tissue sections
were deparaﬃnised and rehydrated in graded alcohol.
the slides were subjected to heat-induced epitope
retrieval by immersing them in 0.01 m boiling citrate
buﬀer (ph 6) in a pressure cooker for 3 min, followed
by a 20-min cooling-oﬀ period. slides were then

incubated overnight with the monoclonal antibody. the
antibody was localised using the dako detection system
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. diaminobenzidine (sigma inc.) was used to visualise antibody
binding. negative and positive control slides were
included with each assay. ki-67 staining equal to or
more than 20% was considered as high level [9].
tumours were considered hr-positive if either or both
oestrogen (er) and progesterone receptors (pr) were
positive in 510% of tumour cells. her2 status was
scored on a scale of 0–3+ according to the dako scoring system. a score of 2+ or 3+ was considered as
overexpression. topoiia status was scored quantitatively and, based on prior studies, staining equal to or
more than 10% was considered as overexpression [11].
the number of her2 and topoii gene copies was
also evaluated using a real-time polymerase (pcr)
method with the light cyclertm system (roche molecular biochemicals). dna was obtained from 518mm
sections of formalin-ﬁxed paraﬃn-embedded blocks
using a qiaamp dna mini-kit (qiagen), with a
modiﬁed version of protocol (wilkam, qiagennews).
her2 ampliﬁcation was measured with the lightcycler–her2 dna quantiﬁcation kit (cat. no. 3 113
922, roche, france), according to the supplier’s
instructions, in which a 112-bp fragment of the her2
gene and a 133-bp fragment of the reference gene are
simultaneously ampliﬁed by the use of speciﬁc sets of
primers. both genes are localised on chromosome 17.
speciﬁc pairs of hybridisation probes (labelled with
ﬂuorescein at the 30 end for both genes and at the 50 end
with lightcycler-red 705 for her2 and lightcyclerred 640 for the reference gene) allowed the diﬀerential
ﬂuorescent detection of the ampliﬁed dna. this was
observed after light excitation, due to the fret (ﬂuorescence energy transfer) between ﬂuorescein and the
ﬂuorophors, which occured only when the probes were
hybridised on the template dna and were therefore in
close proximity. the amount of measured ﬂuorescence
was proportional to the increasing amount of dna
generated during the pcr process). the calculation of
the relative amounts of the her2 gene was performed
by the lightcycler relative quantiﬁcation software.
the ﬁnal results were expressed as a ratio between the

number of her2 gene copies and number of reference
gene copies. a ratio < 2 was assumed to be negative for
her2 ampliﬁcation, a ratio 52 was assumed to be
positive for her2 ampliﬁcation.
topoii ampliﬁcation was measured using the master
sybr green i dye kit (roche molecular biochemicals)
with primers:  xxxg2311xxx -3f 50 -cagcgtgttgagcctgaatg-30 and  xxxg2311xxx -3r 50 -ttgcaggaccacccagtacc-30 . an optimal concentration of 4 mm of
mgcl2 was used.
the reaction mixture was preheated at 95  c for 10
min, followed by ﬁve cycles at 98 for 10 s, 62  c for 10
s, 72  c for 10 s and 35 cycles at 95 for 10 s, 62  c for
10 s, 72  c for 10 s. as a reference gene,  xxxg1025xxx  was
measured using the lightcycler-control kit dna (cat
no. 2 158 833 roche molecular biochemicals). all analyses were performed in at least two independent experiments. for each experimental sample, the amount of
target and reference were determined from the standard
curve included in the lightcycler-control kit dna. then
the target amount was divided by the reference amount
to obtain a normalised topoii value. a ratio 52 was
assumed to be positive for topoii ampliﬁcation.
2.4. statistical analysis
to study the agreement between pathological cr and
the clinical and radiological cr, cohen’s kappa coeﬃcient was used [12]. if there is complete agreement,
kappa is equal to 1. kappa values close to or less than 0
show poor agreement (no better than by chance).
the eﬀect of the diﬀerent biological factors on the
response rate to neoadjuvant chemotherapy was assessed by means of the chi-square test or fisher’s exact
test in comparisons with small numbers. p < 0.05 was
considered to indicate statistical signiﬁcance, and all
resulting p were two-tailed. to identify variables independently related to the response, a multivariate analysis using a logistic regression model was performed. all
variables with a p value less than 0.20 in the univariate
analysis were included in a stepwise forward logistic
regression model, allowing for interaction. p values are
presented for the ﬁnal model. ‘goodness of ﬁt’ was
assessed by the hosmer–lemeshow test.
the statistical analysis was performed using  xxxg22xxx 
( xxxg22xxx  statistical software, inc., los angeles, ca,
usa).

3. results
119 patients with operable breast cancer were treated
with neoadjuvant anthracycline-based chemotherapy at
the paul strauss cancer center between january 2000
and december 2001 (table 1). all breast cancers were
stage ic–iiia invasive adenocarcinomas.

3.1. tumour response to neoadjuvant treatment
as assessed by the physical examination, 61% of the
patients had a pr and 19% had a cr, allowing a clinical overall response (or) of 80%. there was no pd.
following ct measurement, the or was 71% (16%
cr and 55% pr). no pd was observed in the radiological measurements.
after the six cycles of neoadjuvant chemotherapy,
lumpectomy was achieved in 72% of the patients. the
median number of excised axillary lymph nodes was 11.
according to the chevallier classiﬁcation, the pathological cr rate was 9%. according to the sataloﬀ classiﬁcation, this pathological cr rate was 13%.
we studied the agreement of clinical and radiological
cr with the pathological cr. the kappa coeﬃcient
between clinical cr and pathological cr was 0.42
(p=1106). the kappa coeﬃcient between radiological cr and pathological cr was 0.28
(p=6103). with a higher kappa value, clinical
response seemed to be superior to radiological response
in predicting the pathological cr in the present study.
however, the diﬀerence was not statistically signiﬁcant.
3.2. predictive value of tumour grade, hr. ki-67,
her2 and topoii evaluated by ihc
99 patients were assessable for these ﬁve biological
variables. these variables were not evaluated in 20
patients because of a lack of tumour samples. in the
univariate analysis (table 4), high tumour grade, high
tumour cell proliferation (ki-67520%) and absence of
hr expression were predictive of a clinical cr
(p=0.004, 0.002, 0.003, respectively). these three biological factors were also predictive of a pathological cr
according to the sataloﬀ classiﬁcation, (p= 0.0001,
0.01, 0.008, respectively). in our series, the pathological
cr rate (sataloﬀ) was 42% for grade 3 tumours compared with 10% for grade 2 tumours and 0% for grade
1 tumours. the pathological cr rate (sataloﬀ) was
27% for negative hr tumours, compared with 8% for
positive hr tumours. the pathological cr rate (sataloﬀ) was 23% for highly proliferative tumours, compared with 4% for tumours with a low cell proliferation.

overexpression of her2 and topoiia (with a cut-oﬀ at
10%) was not predictive of response to anthracyclinebased chemotherapy. the pathological cr rate (sataloﬀ) was 15% for tumours overexpressing her2 compared with 8% for tumours without overexpressed
her2. the pathological cr rate (sataloﬀ) was 14%
for tumours overexpressing topoiia compared with
10% for tumours without overexpressed topoiia.
we also studied topoiia as a quantitative variable,
using the mann-whitney non-parametric test. increased
topoiia expression was related to a clinical and radiological cr (p=0.01 and 0.05, respectively). median
topoiia expression level was higher when a pathological cr (sataloﬀ) was achieved than when it was not,
but the diﬀerence was not statistically signiﬁcant
(p=0.07).
in multivariate analysis, using a logistic regression
model (table 5), ki-67 and hr status were identiﬁed
as independent variables in predicting a clinical complete response (‘goodness of ﬁt’: p=0.54). tumour
grade was identiﬁed as the only independent variable to
predict a pathological cr according to the sataloﬀ
classiﬁcation (‘goodness of ﬁt’: p=0.98). in this model,
64% of patients with a negative hr tumour and a high
tumour cell proliferation had a clinical cr, and 42%
of patients with a grade 3 tumour had a pathological
cr.
3.3. predictive value of her2 and topoiia evaluated
by real-time pcr
evaluation of the ampliﬁcation of her2 and topoii
by real-time pcr was performed on 99 tumour samples
and results were obtained in 88 and 82 tumour samples,
respectively. ampliﬁcation of her2 gene was demonstrated in 88% of her2 3+ tumours, 25% of her2
2+ tumours and 5% of her2 0-1+ tumours. ampliﬁcation of the topoiia gene was demonstrated in 24%
of tumours with a high topoiia expression and in 26%
of tumours with a low topoiia expression. her2 status and topoii status, assessed by quantitative pcr,
were not related to either the clinical or radiological
tumour response or to the pathological response
(table 6).

4. discussion
in the present study, 119 patients with stage ic to
iiia invasive adenocarcinomas were treated with six
cycles of an anthracycline-based therapy. the clinical
or was 80%, with 19% of cr. the radiological or
was 71%, with 16% of cr. no pd was observed during
the chemotherapy. after surgery, a pathological cr
was demonstrated in 9% of the patients according to
the chevallier classiﬁcation and in 13% of the patients
according to the sataloﬀ classiﬁcation. with a higher
kappa value, clinical response seemed to be superior to
the radiological response evaluated by ct to predict the
pathological cr. in univariate analysis, high tumour
grade, ki-67520%, and absence of hr expression were
predictive factors for a clinical cr and pathological cr
according to the sataloﬀ classiﬁcation. increased
topoiia expression studied as a quantitative variable
was related to a clinical cr (p=0.01). in multivariate
analysis, absence of hr expression and ki-67520%
were predictive for a clinical cr, high tumour grade
was predictive for a pathological cr according to the
sataloﬀ classiﬁcation. her2 expression was not predictive of response. ampliﬁcation of her2 or topoii
was not predictive of the response to anthracyclinebased chemotherapy.
the superiority of a physical examination compared
with radiology to predict pathological ﬁndings on the
primary breast tumour, although not formally demonstrated in our study, possibly due to a lack of statistical
power, has been reported in previous studies. herrada
and colleagues [13] evaluated 100 patients to correlate
physical examination, sonographic and mammographic
measurements of breast tumours with pathological
ﬁndings after neoadjuvant chemotherapy. physical
examination provided the best correlation with pathology ﬁndings on the primary tumour, and sonography
showed the best correlation for the lymph nodes. lluch
and colleagues [14] evaluated 60 patients to study the
role of physical examination and ct in deﬁning the

209

tumour response after neoadjuvant chemotherapy.
physical examination provided the best assessment of the
primary breast tumour, whereas ct was the best noninvasive method to detect axillary node involvement.
several studies have already assessed the predictive
value of tumour grade, hr status, and tumour cell
proliferation in predicting the response to neoadjuvant
chemotherapy. high-grade tumours generally show a
signiﬁcantly higher percentage of responders compared
with low-grade tumours [15,16]. negative hr status
[17,18] and a high tumour cell proliferation [19,20] are
also correlated with chemosensitivity. in the present
study, 64% of patients with a negative hr tumour and
a high tumour cell proliferation had a clinical cr,
compared with 3% for tumours with the opposite characteristics. a pathological cr was demonstrated in
42% of patients with grade 3 tumours compared with
0% for those with grade 1 tumours.
ampliﬁcation and overexpression of her2 are
strongly linked in breast cancer [21,22]. the overall
concordance of ihc with the cb11 antibody with
quantitative pcr was also 88% in a prospective study
on 254 breast cancers [23]. our data support the
hypothesis that topoiia could be ampliﬁed simultaneously with her2, because they are located close to
one another on chromosome 17. in the present study,
90% (18/20) of tumours with topoii ampliﬁcation also
had a her2 ampliﬁcation. there was no relationship
between topoii ampliﬁcation and expression in our
study. the fact that topoii is a cell-cycle-regulated
protein might explain these results [24]. topoiia
expression can be considered as a marker of cell proliferation [25]. in the present study, ki-67 and topoiia
expressions were strongly correlated (p=4109,
spearman rank correlation coeﬃcient=0.62).
most data on her2 expression and anthracycline
sensitivity have been derived from adjuvant clinical
trials. the addition or dose increase of doxorubicin in
the adjuvant treatment signiﬁcantly improved the outcome of patients with her-2+ tumours, but not of
patients with her-2 tumours in three retrospective
studies [26–28]. data in the neoadjuvant setting are
conﬂicting. some studies have failed to show any predictive value for her2 expression [17,29,30]. a recent
study from the md anderson cancer centre did not
found any correlation between the clinical and pathological response to neoadjuvant anthracycline-based
chemotherapy and her2 expression in 97 patients [31].
similarly, her2 status did not predict response to
neoadjuvant anthracycline-based chemotherapy in 97
patients in a netherlands cancer institute study [32]. in
contrast, willsher and colleagues found a correlation
between her2 expression and resistance to mitoxantrone-based chemotherapy [33]. geisler and colleagues
demonstrated that her2 overexpression predicted
resistance to a low-dose anthracycline chemotherapy

210

t. petit et al. / european journal of cancer 40 (2004) 205–211

[34]. we recently showed in the neoadjuvant setting that
low-dose anthracycline and her-2 overexpression predicted a poor or, low- or high-dose anthracycline and
the absence of her-2 overexpression predicted an
intermediate or, and high-dose anthracycline and
her-2 overexpression predicted a high or [35]. in the
present study, the high dose of anthracycline ( xxxd2008xxx 
100 mg/m2) used for all patients could explain the
absence of a predictive value of her2 overexpression
or ampliﬁcation.
two studies have evaluated the predictive value of
her2 and topoii ampliﬁcation, in 35 and 67 patients,
respectively, treated with an anthracycline-based
chemotherapy (doxorubicin 50 mg/m2) [36,37]. in the
ﬁrst study, her2 and topoii ampliﬁcation evaluated
by in situ hybridisation were signiﬁcantly associated
with an increased response rate [36]. in the second
study, response to chemotherapy was increased in cases
with a coampliﬁcation of her2 and topoiia evaluated
by a chromogenic in situ hybridisation [37].
in conclusion, her2 or topoiia were not predictive
markers of response to neoadjuvant anthracyclinebased chemotherapy in breast cancer patients in the
present study. patients with a negative hr status, high
grade breast tumours with a high tumour cell proliferation (ki-67520%) were much more likely to respond to
neoadjuvant anthracycline-based chemotherapy than
patients with the opposite characteristics. nevertheless,
the predictive value of these markers for an individual
patient is limited. microarray technology should allow,
in the future, the individual adjustment of treatment
and selection of patients who would beneﬁt most from
neoadjuvant chemotherapy [38].
