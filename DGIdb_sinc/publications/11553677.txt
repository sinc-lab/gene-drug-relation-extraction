activity of  xxxd1792xxx  and its brominated isosteres on recombinant human alpha7, alpha4beta2 and alpha4beta4 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors.  effects of  xxxd1792xxx  (cy), 3-bromocytisine (3-br-cy), 5-bromocytisine (5-br-cy) and 3,5-dibromocytisine (3,5-dibr-cy) on human (h) alpha7-, alpha4beta2- and alpha4beta4 nicotinic acetylcholine (nach) receptors, expressed in xenopus oocytes and cell lines, have been investigated. cy and its bromo-isosteres fully inhibited binding of both [alpha-(125)i]bungarotoxin ([alpha-(125)i]bgtx) to halpha7- and [(3)h]cy to halpha4beta2- or halpha4beta4-nach receptors. 3-br-cy was the most potent inhibitor of both [alpha-(125)i]bgtx and [(3)h]cy binding. cy was less potent than 3-br-cy, but 5-br-cy and 3,5-dibr-cy were the least potent inhibitors. cy and 3-br-cy were potent full agonists at halpha7-nach receptors but behaved as partial agonists at halpha4beta2- and halpha4beta4-nach receptors. 5-br-cy and 3,5-dibr-cy had low potency and were partial agonists at halpha7- and halpha4beta4-nach receptors, but they elicited no responses on halpha4beta2-nach receptors. cy and 3-br-cy produced dual dose-response curves (drc) at both halpha4beta2- and halpha4beta4-nach receptors, but ach produced dual drc only at halpha4beta2-nach receptors. low concentrations of cy, 3-br-cy and 5-br-cy enhanced ach responses of oocytes expressing halpha4beta2-nach receptors, but at high concentrations they inhibited the responses. in contrast, 3,5-dibr-cy only inhibited, in a competitive manner, ach responses of halpha4beta2-nach receptors. it is concluded that bromination of the pyridone ring of cy produces marked changes in effects of cy that are manifest as nach receptor subtype-specific differences in binding affinities and in functional potencies and efficacies.
