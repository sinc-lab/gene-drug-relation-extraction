bacterial hyaluronidases have long been known as the
“spreading factors” or virulence factors responsible for a wide
range of acute and invasive infections in humans causing lifethreatening diseases, such as pneumonia, meningitis, and septicemia among many others (1–3). these enzymes directly
facilitate the spread of infection by degrading the ha3 matrix,
which constitutes a highly organized network in the extracellular space in all vertebrates, acting as a diffusion barrier in vivo
and regulating the transport of other substances through the
intercellular space (4). the ha matrix in extracellular matrix is
mainly composed of ha polymer, a negatively charged polysac-

charide of repeating disaccharide units of d-glucuronic acid
(␤-1,3) and n-acetyl-␤- xxxd2211xxx , and is highly viscous in
nature (5). hyaluronidases are able to split this matrix, reducing
its viscoelasticity and increasing membrane permeability,
thereby allowing greater microbial access to or promoting diffusion between host tissues for colonization (4, 6, 7). the organized structure of ha substantially influences binding to receptors and to the active site of hyaluronidases. bacterial
hyaluronidases, isolated from strains of various microorganisms such as clostridium, micrococcus, streptococcus, or streptomyces, degrade ha at very fast rates via a ␤-elimination reaction that cleaves the alternate ␤-1,4-glycosidic linkage between
the repeating units, resulting in unsaturated disaccharide products (8, 9). although the mechanism of hyaluronidase-mediated degradation of ha has been very well elucidated through
biochemical as well as structural investigations (10, 11), relatively little is known about the defense mechanisms used by the
host during infection or about the role of ha and hyaluronidase
in pathophysiological processes. it is believed that the balance
of ha biosynthesis and intrinsic hyaluronidase levels may
be regulated by invoking specific inhibitors (12–14). as a result,
potent and specific inhibitors of bacterial  xxxd2289xxx  lyase
would have enormous therapeutic potential as drugs in the
treatment of various bacterial infections.
the search for effective hyaluronidase inhibitors began more
than half a century ago (2, 15–18) and continues to this day.
exogenous small molecule inhibitors have been identified, but
they have weak potency and low selectivity, and there are many
unanswered questions with regard to their mechanism of inhibition and whether they would be active against bacterial hyaluronidases as well. for example, heparins and derivatives of
alginic acids (19, 20) have structural similarity to ha, whereas
polyphenols, flavone analogues (21), saponins, norlignans, or
antiallergic drugs are among other reported inhibitors of hyaluronidases (22, 23).  xxxd228xxx , l-arginine derivatives, and fatty
acids have been reported to inhibit streptococcal hyaluronidases at submillimolar concentrations, but a comparison of
percent inhibition and ic50 values between these and previous
reports is difficult because of differences in the experimental
conditions (24 –26). in view of the enormous medical applications of effective inhibitors, a systematic search has continued,
using computer-aided drug design strategies. a rational analysis based on structural interactions led to the identification of a
hydrophobic derivative of  xxxd228xxx  as a strong inhibitor of

bacterial hyaluronan lyase enzymes are the major virulence
factors that enable greater microbial ingress by cleaving hyaluronan (ha) polymers present predominantly in extracellular
space of vertebrates. based on the premise that effective inhibitors may bind to and stabilize ha thereby protecting it from
degradation, here we investigated inhibitory activity of human
 xxxg278xxx  ( xxxg278xxx ) on bacterial hyaluronidase because it is highly specific to ha and localized on the cell
surface. biochemical characterization revealed that  xxxg278xxx  is a
competitive inhibitor of streptococcus pneumoniae  xxxd2289xxx 
lyase (spnhl) with an ic50 value of 22 ␮m. this is thus the first
report of an endogenous protein inhibitor that may be used during natural antibacterial defense. our findings also support a
novel multipronged mechanism for the high efficacy of habp1mediated inhibition based on structural modeling of enzyme,
substrate, and inhibitor. evidence from docking simulations
and contact interface interactions showed that the inherent
charge asymmetry of  xxxg278xxx  plays a key role in the inhibitory
activity. this novel role of  xxxg278xxx  may pave the way for peptide
inhibitors as alternatives to synthetic chemicals in antibacterial
research.

inhibition of spnhl by  xxxg278xxx 

experimental procedures
general materials and reagents—substrate from human
umbilical cord ha was purchased from sigma co. all other
chemicals were of analytical grade and obtained from sigma.
purification and estimation of  xxxg278xxx — xxxg278xxx  (amino
acids 74 –282) was overexpressed in escherichia coli and purified following the method described earlier (34) with modifications using the 55–90% ammonium sulfate cut followed by ion
exchange chromatography on mono qtm hr (10/10) column
(amersham biosciences) using a linear gradient of 0 –1 m nacl
in 20 mm tris, ph 7.2, after washing the column with 150 mm
nacl in 20 mm tris, ph 7.2. the pooled peak fractions were
dialyzed in 150 mm nacl, 20 mm tris, ph 7.2, and quantified for
further use.
assay of spnhl enzymatic activity—the activity of spnhl
was determined following the method described earlier (35)
and is defined as its ability to break down ha to unsaturated
disaccharide units (36). in a 1-ml solution of 0.2 mg/ml ha in
50 mm sodium acetate buffer, 10 mm cacl2, ph 6.5, 10 ␮l of
enzyme sample (3 ng/␮l, diluted just before taking measurement) was added. the reaction mixture was incubated for 5 min
during which the measurements were carried out by monitor-

bio uv-visible double beam spectrophotometer (varian inc.).
determination of inhibitory activity on hyaluronidase—the
in vitro enzyme inhibition experiments were performed with
varying concentrations of  xxxg278xxx . the inhibitory effect of
 xxxg278xxx  on s. pneumoniae hyaluronidase was measured by
using two different enzymatic inhibition assays. in the first
assay 0.2 mg/ml ha was preincubated with varying concentrations (0 –100 ␮m) of  xxxg278xxx  for 1 h at 4 °c in a l-ml reaction
volume of 50 mm sodium acetate buffer, 10 mm cacl2, ph 6.5.
the reaction was initiated with 30 ng of enzyme, and activity
was measured. in the second assay, 30 ng of spnhl was preincubated in the above mentioned 1-ml reaction volume of buffer
with varying concentrations of  xxxg278xxx  (0 –100 ␮m) for 1 h at
4 °c. the reaction was initiated with 0.2 mg/ml ha, and enzymatic activity was measured. in both assays, the reaction was
initiated exactly at 60 s after the addition of either enzyme or
ha, respectively, to the reaction mixture. the progress of the
reaction was monitored by detecting the appearance of ha oligosaccharide at 232 nm absorbance.
enzyme activity in absence and presence of inhibitor—to
study the effect of varying the concentration of substrate in the
presence of inhibitor, ha concentration in solution was
expressed as moles of hexasaccharide based on a hexasaccharide molecular weight of 1203.9 (37). in the absence of inhibitor,
varying concentrations of ha (0.0625– 0.750 mm) in 150 mm
sodium acetate buffer, 10 mm cacl2, ph 6.5, was added to the
enzyme (30 ng), and the activity was measured. in the presence
of inhibitor, 20 ␮m  xxxg278xxx  was preincubated with the enzyme
(30 ng) for 1 h at 4 °c in a 1-ml reaction volume of buffer,
increasing concentrations of ha (0.0625– 0.750 mm) were
added, and enzymatic activity was measured exactly 60 s after
the ha was added to the reaction mixture. the progress of the
reaction was monitored by detecting the appearance of ha oligosaccharide at 232 nm absorbance.
initial velocity measurement and data analysis—the reaction progress curves for the enzymatic activity and enzyme
inhibition were obtained by measurement of the absorbance at
232 nm due to the unsaturated disaccharide product. the reaction was carried out in a 1-ml solution of 50 mm sodium acetate
buffer, 10 mm cacl2, ph 6.5, with substrate concentration
ranging from 0.2072 to 0.3469 mm ha in the above buffer. the
reaction was initiated by the addition of 10 ␮l of enzyme in the
same buffer. the product absorbance was measured every 60 s
for 5 min at 25 °c. the reaction progress was linear over the
time of measurement within the precision of the instrument.
the initial velocity of the reaction was determined from the
increase in absorbance over the first 5 min of the reaction.
the slope was divided by the molar absorption coefficient for
the disaccharide product, 5.5 ⫻ 103 mol⫺1 cm⫺1 (36). the values were calculated and expressed in ␮m/min ha degradation
by spnhl in the presence of  xxxg278xxx .
the data for initial velocity, vi, from each experiment in
which the concentration of substrate, s, was varied, were fit into
the michaelis-menten equation with a nonlinear regression
program (graphpad prism, version 5, graphpad software inc.,
san diego, ca). for all experiments, goodness-of-fit statistics
showed that r2 and correlation values were greater than 0.987

streptococcus agalactiae hyaluronidase, but it was weakly active
against streptococcus pneumoniae, a major human gram-positive pathogen (27). computer-aided drug design-based strategies mainly explore new leads by virtue of structural similarity
to ha or, in some cases, by rational de novo approaches. an
alternative strategy may also exist wherein an inhibitor may
bind to and stabilize ha thereby protecting it from degradation. such an alternative is plausible because ha has been
known to bind and interact with receptors and a large number
of ha-binding proteins. hyaladherins are a very well characterized and highly selective family of proteins reported to interact non-covalently with ha and have a wide array of functions,
including receptor-mediated activation of intracellular signaling and structural aggregations in the extracellular matrix (28 –
30). we therefore began this work with the surmise that a
potent hyaluronidase inhibitor may be supplied endogenously
by one of these ubiquitous proteins.  xxxg278xxx  (synonym human
p32 or  xxxg278xxx ), a member of the multifunctional hyaladherin
family, is a 68-kda protein originally purified and cloned from
human fibroblast as a novel ha receptor by our group (31). in
this work,  xxxg278xxx  was tested as an inhibitor of bacterial hyaluronidase because we had already confirmed its localization on
the cell surface (32). according to the crystal structure of
 xxxg278xxx , it exists as a homotrimer having n-terminal ␣-helices
and asymmetric charge distribution with structural plasticity
(33).
here we report the role of  xxxg278xxx  as an inhibitor of s. pneumoniae hyaluronidase (spnhl) and the elucidation of its competitive nature of inhibition. we also propose a unique multipronged mechanism of action based upon evidence from
structural modeling of the interactions among substrate,
enzyme, and inhibitor. thus we present biochemical evidence
for a novel role of  xxxg278xxx  in pathophysiological processes as a
highly potent inhibitor of spnhl, offering a variety of avenues
for optimization of selectivity and potency.

ng of the enzyme. the second curve (e) represents increasing concentrations
of  xxxg278xxx  (0 –100 ␮m) preincubated with spnhl (10 ␮l of 3 ng/␮l) before the
reaction was initiated with 0.2 mg/ml ha. in both cases, activity was measured at 232 nm. in b, the graph represents the percent inhibition of spnhl
activity as plotted against varying concentrations of inhibitor. the values represent the average of four different experiments.

results
in vitro effect of  xxxg278xxx  on the activity of spnhl
the in vitro enzyme inhibition experiments demonstrated
that highly purified  xxxg278xxx  inhibits spnhl activity in a concentration-dependent manner as shown in fig. 1. the activity
of purified spnhl gradually decreased in the presence of
increasing concentrations of purified  xxxg278xxx  either when
 xxxg278xxx  was preincubated with ha and the reaction was initiated with spnhl or when it was preincubated with the enzyme
spnhl and the reaction was initiated with ha. this can be seen
much better in fig. 1b, which shows a plot of percent inhibition
of spnhl activity versus inhibitor concentration.  xxxg278xxx  was
found to inhibit spnhl with an ic50 value of 22 ␮m.

and 0.982, respectively. among the curve fitting results, the
program gave values of vmax and km as well as their respective
standard deviations (␴).
computational simulations—the structural details of the
interactions among substrate, enzyme, and inhibitor were elucidated by molecular docking experiments. available crystal
structures of the s. pneumoniae  xxxd2289xxx  lyase (protein data
bank code 1loh) and human  xxxg278xxx  (protein data bank code
1p32) were used for docking studies (33). the three-dimensional structures of the ha oligomers, namely disaccharide,
tetrasaccharide, and hexasaccharide, were processed from the
available crystal structure complex of spnhl and ha hexasaccharide (protein data bank code 1loh). details of local noncovalent interactions were studied using an in-house fortran
program/script that requires an interacting complex in protein
data bank format. the solvent-accessible area lost upon complexation was measured using naccess (38). all visualizations and renderings were done using vmd (visual molecular
dynamics) (39) and pymol (40).
substrate inhibitor interaction—the three-dimensional
structure of the inhibitor (protein data bank code 1p32)
having three potential active sites (one per monomer) was
treated as the static “receptor” molecule with ha polysaccharide as the mobile “ligand” molecule. the three processed
ha oligomers were docked to  xxxg278xxx , one at a time, with the
experimentally characterized bx7b (where b is a basic residue) ha binding motif (residues 119 –128, 1p32 numbering)
defined as the binding site (31, 41). flex-x molecular docking program was used because it is able to accurately predict
the geometry of the protein-ligand complex for a protein
with known three-dimensional structure and a small ligand
molecule. flex-x is based on a robust incremental construction algorithm where the ligand is decomposed into pieces
and thereafter flexibly rebuilt in the active site using multiple
placement strategies followed by a ranking of all orientations
using a variety of scoring functions. hydrogens were added
to both structures before the experiment. default parameter
values were used, and the top ranking orientations were considered for further analysis.
enzyme inhibitor interaction—the enzyme s. pneumoniae
 xxxd2289xxx  lyase protein (protein data bank code 1loh),
which was the smaller of the two proteins, was kept flexible and
docked onto the  xxxg278xxx  homotrimer, which was kept static.
preprocessing of the hyaluronidase involved removal of ha and
water molecules. the receptor and ligand were projected onto a
160-å cubical grid using zdock, a rigid body docking program, followed by a refinement program, rdock. zdock
uses a fast fourier transform to search all possible binding
modes for the proteins, evaluating based on shape complementarity, desolvation energy, and electrostatics. the top 2000 predictions from zdock were submitted to rdock where they
were minimized by charmm (chemistry at harvard molecular mechanics) to improve the energies and eliminate clashes.
finally the electrostatic and desolvation energies were recomputed by rdock, and the top ranking complex was selected for
analysis of the contact interface.

value for ki was obtained from plots of 1/v versus 1/[s]. it was

these results confirmed that the inhibition observed in fig. 1 is
competitive in nature.

to comprehend the molecular details and structural implications of the observed competitive inhibition,  xxxg278xxx  was
docked with spnhl as described under “experimental procedures.” analysis of the top ranking docking complex confirmed
that  xxxg278xxx  binds to the enzyme in the same region where
substrate ha has been reported to bind (37); the data thus support the competitive inhibition observed in the experimental
assays.

of the inhibitor. for example, arginines 462 and 466 of this
patch lose 27 and 47 å2 of their residue surface accessibility,
respectively, to ionic interactions with glutamates 198 and 200
of  xxxg278xxx , amounting to a 77.4% loss of accessibility. other
residues comprising the positive patch, namely lys-250, arg300, arg-355, and arg-480, also get buried during the inhibitory interaction, resulting in an overall loss of 71% surface
accessible area for this patch. the negative patch comprising
residues glu-388, asp-398, and thr-400 has been implicated in
the product release process of spnhl. the above mentioned
interactions involving the positive patch of the enzyme also lead
to the occlusion of the residues in the negative patch because
the two patches lie in close vicinity of each other. in particular,
glu-388 was observed to lose 12.5-å2 (roughly 26%) surface
area during the interaction with  xxxg278xxx .
it may be noted that the residues of the ha binding motif (of
 xxxg278xxx ) are not involved in any of its interactions with spnhl.
of the three potential ha binding sites on a given  xxxg278xxx  trimer, two are completely accessible during the inhibitory interaction. the third binding site shows a small overlap as three of
the 24  xxxg278xxx  residues required for sugar binding lose partial
side chain accessibility during the inhibitory interaction. these
three residues are shown in table 1. a perusal of this partially
buried region reveals that the lost  xxxd234xxx . is relatively insignificant
(roughly 6%) as a result of which all three binding sites of
 xxxg278xxx  retain sufficient accessibility when it mediates the inhibition of spnhl. the significance of this observation for the
mechanism of action is discussed below.

discussion
in the present study, we have characterized human  xxxg278xxx 
as the only known endogenous protein inhibitor of spnhl, thus
implying indirectly its functional role in defense against bacterial invasion. the mechanistic/structural aspects of this inhibition have been elucidated with the help of docking simulations.
 xxxg278xxx  with an ic50 value of 22 ␮m is one of the most potent
inhibitors of spnhl reported to date.  xxxd228xxx  6- xxxd2833xxx  has previously been reported as an inhibitor of s. agalactiae  xxxd2289xxx  lyase with an ic50 of 4 ␮m, but it showed
much weaker inhibition of spnhl with an ic50 of 100 ␮m (27).
we have analyzed enzyme substrate interaction in context with
enzyme-inhibitor and substrate-inhibitor interactions to elucidate the structural details of the observed inhibition.
preincubation of  xxxg278xxx  and ha was able to inhibit the
enzyme activity, and there was no further degradation of ha
upon addition of spnhl to the reaction solution. it was
observed that ha degradation and product release are totally
dependent on the ratio of  xxxg278xxx  and ha molecules present in
the reaction solution. with the increase in  xxxg278xxx  concentration in the reaction solution, a decrease in enzymatic activity
was observed, whereas upon increasing the concentration of
ha, the enzymatic activity was retained. for a given amount of
ha, however, low  xxxg278xxx  was not able to block enzyme or
sequester substrate, but with high concentration of  xxxg278xxx ,
95% inhibition was observed. furthermore there was no change
in enzymatic activity when the concentration of ha was kept
equal to that of  xxxg278xxx . it is therefore plausible that during the
preincubation binding occurred between  xxxg278xxx  and its ligand

ionic interactions. the inhibitory activity of  xxxg278xxx  is evidently
due to the combined effect of the considerable number of noncovalent interactions it forms with catalytically essential residues in the active site of the enzyme.
as can be seen in fig. 4, the binding potency of the inhibitor
is a virtue of electrostatic, hydrophobic, and hydrogen bonding
interactions all along the contact interface mainly in the catalytic pocket region and a few involving the ␣-domain of the
enzyme. several interesting features of the complex become
evident because the orientation of inhibitor obstructs the
region on the enzyme where substrate must enter and bind,
thereby rendering the cleft inaccessible. the majority of interactions at the interface are electrostatic in nature. it may be
noted that the enzyme active site, which is in the form of a cleft
between the two structural domains of spnhl, has a highly
positive center, and the negatively charged projection of
 xxxg278xxx  plays a key role in facilitating the attachment, thereby
effecting the high charge complementarity at the interface. the
maximum ionic contacts are observed in the product release
region, which has previously been shown to be an important
target site for hyaluronidase inhibitors (27). small moleculebased inhibitor design strategies also target specific residues
within the active site that are known to be crucial for catalysis.
targeting of these sites in the enzyme has been reported to add
to the potency of inhibition (43). these reports add strength to
our data because many of the reported crucial groups of residues were observed to be blocked by the inhibitor  xxxg278xxx  in the
final refined model as follows.
the catalytic triad—the side chain of the catalytically
active his-399 residue is blocked by close proximity to the
backbone and negative side chains of residue asp-197 on the
inhibitor. as shown in fig. 4, residues his-399 and asn-349 of
the catalytic triad make electrostatic and hydrogen bond interactions with the inhibitor. his-399 makes a hydrogen bond with
ser-201 of  xxxg278xxx , whereas asn-349 is involved in hydrogen
bonding with residue asp-197. although tyr-408 does not
interact specifically with the inhibitor, it is within 5-å distance
of the negative projection of  xxxg278xxx  and thus rendered
solvent-inaccessible.
the aromatic patch—residues trp-291, trp-292, and phe343 of spnhl are known to constitute the aromatic patch on
one end of the enzyme cleft, which has been reported to be
responsible for the correct positioning of substrate chains for
catalysis, i.e. for the selection of cleavage sites on the ha substrate (27). asp-197 of  xxxg278xxx  completely obstructs this aromatic patch, making hydrophobic interactions with all three
patch residues. trp-292 makes additional hydrophobic interactions with residues 198 –200 of the inhibitor. interactions
between other residues in the vicinity, namely ile-296 and gly297 from the enzyme and ala-199 from the inhibitor, further
obstruct the surface accessibility of this patch. overall these
interactions lead to a total loss of more than 75% residue
surface accessibility for the aromatic patch, thereby burying
it extensively.
the positive and negative patches—the dense electrostatic
interactions at the binding interface depicted in fig. 4 are
formed between the outermost residues of the catalytically
essential positive patch of the enzyme and the negative surface

figure 5. proposed model for the multifaceted mechanism of habp1mediated spnhl inhibition. in this figure, multiple ha hexasaccharide
ligands (atom colors, stick representation) have been structurally superimposed upon the docked complex of enzyme and inhibitor (trimer shown in
gray). spnhl has been colored by secondary structure (helices, red; sheets,
yellow; loops, green), and its active site has been depicted with ha oligomer
to highlight how the substrate binding region is entirely blocked by the one
side/face of the inhibitor. similarly multiple ha oligomers have been depicted
bound to the inhibitor to show that the three ha binding motif sites (green,
line representation) are free to bind substrate ha molecules even when one
entire side of the protein is blocking the spnhl active site. residues of the
enzyme and inhibitor within 5 å of each other are depicted in blue and purple
lines. hydrogen bonds are depicted as yellow dashes. the ha orientations
used for superimposition have been taken from the crystal structure (for
spnhl), and the top ranking docked complexes are discussed in the text (for

architectures and are therefore not likely to be inhibited by
 xxxg278xxx . it may be conjectured that this strategy of selective
defense against bacterial hyaluronidases may have evolved in
mammalian hosts to protect their own hyaluronidases from
inhibition. it is encouraging to note that there have been
reports of up-regulation and involvement of  xxxg278xxx  in inflammation, apoptosis, and bacterial infections like listeria (44, 45).
based on the crystal structure it has been suggested that terminal ␣-helices of  xxxg278xxx  are critical for maintaining trimeric
assembly as well as protein-protein interactions (33, 46). this is
also evident from the trp-glu signature motif at the n-terminal region of  xxxg278xxx  that is homologous to the wd-40 family of
proteins that play predominant roles in interprotein interactions (47). a few viral proteins and bacterial proteins have
already been reported to interact with  xxxg278xxx  (48). however,
although its multifunctional nature has been characterized, its
role in hyaluronan protection has never been explored before.
apart from the ability to competitively inhibit bacterial hyaluronidases,  xxxg278xxx  has the added advantage of being able to
bind and sequester multiple ha oligomers by virtue of its
unique structural asymmetry. our observations thus also
explain the inherent charge asymmetry of the  xxxg278xxx  structure
that had not been accounted for until now. it may be speculated
that, at least to some extent, this characteristic may be used to

ha, thereby protecting the latter from the enzyme. this deduction was structurally supported by docking experiments
between  xxxg278xxx  and ha that revealed a tight binding with the
␤-1,4-glycosidic linkage of ha via hydrogen bonding as well as
hydrophobic interactions (shown in fig. 2 and table 1).
having thus confirmed the protection of ha by  xxxg278xxx , we
tested whether this was the exclusive mode of inhibition used
by the inhibitor. as shown in fig. 1a, the inhibition of enzyme
observed upon preincubating substrate and inhibitor was found
to be comparable to the inhibition observed upon preincubating the enzyme and inhibitor. subsequently assays were carried
out to determine the nature of this inhibition. as shown in fig.
3, lineweaver-burke plot analysis confirmed that  xxxg278xxx 
inhibits spnhl activity in a competitive manner. docking
experiments between spnhl and  xxxg278xxx  further provided the
molecular details of the contact interface between  xxxg278xxx  and
the active site cleft of spnhl (fig. 4). it was also observed that
 xxxg278xxx  uses only the negative side/face of its trimeric (roughly
flat) structure during the inhibition of spnhl. these observations were taken together to build a novel mechanism of
 xxxg278xxx -mediated inhibition of spnhl.
a novel mechanism for  xxxg278xxx -mediated inhibition of
spnhl—the fascinating aspect of our study is that the sugar is
capable of binding to both enzyme and inhibitor, and in both
cases, it is the ␤-1,4-glycosidic linkage of the sugar, which is
buried in the receptors. rationalization of the competitive
nature of inhibition has further revealed that the enzyme
spnhl binds to the substrate and inhibitor in the same region,
namely the active site cleft. it is remarkable that the doughnutshaped  xxxg278xxx  acting as an inhibitor uses only its negative face/
side for blocking the enzyme, whereas the opposite side/face is
used for binding to the relatively negatively charged ha. evidently the inhibitor uses two distinct and spatially separate sites
for binding to the enzyme and the substrate. based on these
observations from experiments as well as computational simulations, we hypothesize that  xxxg278xxx  may use a novel and unique
multipronged mechanism/model for lowering hyaluronidase
activity. according to this model, on one hand,  xxxg278xxx 
obstructs the active site of the enzyme to inhibit its activity,
thereby following the nature of competitive inhibition. on the
other hand, it uses its large free side/face to bind and sequester
up to three additional ha polymers from the matrix, thereby
protecting ha from spnhl-mediated degradation during
infection. this model has been structurally depicted in fig. 5.
although one of the three inter chain junctions (or ha binding
sites) shows a slight loss of residue surface area during the
inhibitory interaction, 21 of 24 residues depicted in table 1
remain fully accessible and free to bind ha oligomers. alternatively a single long polymer of ha may bind to  xxxg278xxx  using all
three of its binding sites to circumvent degradation.
biological implications—our findings reveal that  xxxg278xxx 
interacts with and blocks a large number of crucial/conserved
groups of residues in the active site cleft of spnhl. a majority of
bacterial  xxxd2289xxx  lyases are known to have a high degree of
sequence conservation in the cleft region, and consequently, we
speculate that they may also be inhibited by  xxxg278xxx  in a similar
manner. in contrast, mammalian and bacteriophage hyaluronidase enzymes have very different sequence as well as structural

protect the host ha matrix from endogenous hyaluronidases as
well.
competitive inhibition conventionally refers to structural
analogy between substrate and inhibitor leading to competition
of both for the active site of the enzyme. it must be noted that
although we demonstrate the phenomenon of competitive
inhibition here the inhibitor is structurally distinct from the
substrate, and there is also a simultaneous blocking interaction
of  xxxg278xxx  with its substrate ha. such a dual mode of inhibition
is a unique phenomenon by itself, not previously demonstrated
by any other enzyme inhibitor. it is true that free unbridled
hyaluronidase activity would create much havoc, and nature
must have created a great number of mechanisms for keeping
these enzymes in check, mechanisms that must function at
multiple levels. we believe that the data presented in this work
may describe how remarkable such checking mechanisms can
be and that they may indeed function at multiple levels
simultaneously.
in conclusion, the identification of  xxxg278xxx  as a competitive
inhibitor of spnhl constitutes a new line of defense against
bacterial invasion and offers novel opportunities for therapeutic intervention, making it a highly suitable candidate to be
investigated further for optimization of potency and specificity
against bacterial virulence factors. furthermore based on the
insights obtained in this study, it will be possible to design short
inhibitory peptides for binding and protecting ha polymers.
efforts in this direction present an alternative to synthetic
chemicals and are currently underway in our laboratory.
