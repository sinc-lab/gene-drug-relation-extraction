abstract
the present study was performed to evaluate the role of glucagon in the regulation of ghrelin secretion from the rat stomach. mrna
for ghrelin and  xxxg874xxx  was expressed predominantly in the lower body and pylorus of stomach, but little or not in the upper
body and cardia. ghrelin- and  xxxg874xxx -immunoreactive cells were detected in lamina propria mucosae of stomach and some
cells expressed both. intravenous administration of glucagon caused transient increases in both acyl- and desacyl-ghrelin levels in the
gastric vein within 10 min, which was followed by gradual increases in desacyl-ghrelin levels until 60 min. steady state levels of ghrelin
mrna in the stomach were increased by 1.9-fold 20 min after glucagon administration, but not at 5 or 120 min. these results suggest
that glucagon stimulates acute release of both forms of ghrelin and thereafter upregulates synthesis and release of desacyl-ghrelin in the
rat stomach.

ghrelin was originally discovered in rat and human
stomachs as an endogenous ligand for the growth hormone
secretagogue receptor ( xxxg894xxx ) and is a 28-amino acid
peptide with an n-octanoylation modiﬁcation at ser3 [1].
the main source of circulating ghrelin is considered to be
the stomach, and ghrelin is also produced in various tissues
[2]. in addition to stimulating growth hormone secretion,
ghrelin exerts a variety of metabolic eﬀects including stimulation of food intake and body weight gain [3], gastric
acid secretion and stomach motility [4]. ghrelin also inﬂuences insulin and gastrin secretion [5]. these ﬁndings
strongly support the notion that ghrelin is an important
metabolic hormone. in addition to the acylated form of
ghrelin, another form of the molecule, desacylated ghrelin,

is also present in the peripheral circulation, and the plasma
level of desacyl-ghrelin is higher than that of acyl-ghrelin
[2,6].
expression and secretion of gastric ghrelin increase with
food restriction and decrease with food intake [5]. the regulatory mechanism of the ghrelin secretion from the stomach is still largely unknown, but may reﬂect actions of
enteric or pancreatic hormones that are altered by changes
in nutritional status. somatostatin suppresses ghrelin secretion [7] whereas eﬀects of insulin and leptin on ghrelin
secretion are somehow conﬂicting as both stimulation [8]
and inhibition [9] have been reported. glucagon is secreted
by a cells of the pancreas and plays an important role in
carbohydrate metabolism together with insulin. apart
from islets of the pancreas where it regulates insulin secretion, numerous other tissues including the gastrointestinal
tract express glucagon receptors which act through the
camp-signaling pathway [10]. considering that the

secretion of glucagon increases with fasting [11], the present study was performed to examine eﬀects of glucagon
on the secretion of acyl- and desacyl-ghrelin selectively into
the gastric vein of rats. the eﬀect of glucagon on steady
state levels of ghrelin precursor mrna in the stomach
was also investigated. further, regional distribution of  xxxg874xxx  and ghrelin expression in the rat stomach
was elucidated.
materials and methods
animals. adult male sprague–dawley rats of eight to fourteen weeks
of age were used in this study. the rats were maintained under a 12:12 h
light/dark cycle (lights on at 07.00 h) and room temperature of 24 ± 2 c
with food and water provided ad libitum. all procedures were performed
in accordance with the japanese physiological society’s guidelines for
animal care.
double staining immunohistochemical analyses for ghrelin and glucagon
receptor. rats were anesthetized by an intraperitoneal injection of pentobarbital, perfused transcardially with 100 ml of 0.1 m phosphate buﬀer
(ph 7.4) containing 100 u heparin, and then with 150 ml of ﬁxative
containing 2% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 m phosphate buﬀer. the stomach
was removed and placed in ﬁxative for 2 days at 4 c and then transferred
to 0.1 m phosphate buﬀer containing 20% sucrose. sections were cut at a
thickness of 10 lm with a cryostat at a temperature of 20 c. the sections were pretreated with blocking solution with 1.5% donkey serum and
3% bovine  xxxg124xxx  for 1 h, and then, incubated for 2 days at 4 c
with each rabbit antiserum against rat ghrelin (against the n-terminal
[cys12]-ghrelin [1–11]) together with goat antiserum against human  xxxg874xxx  [1–16] (santa cruz biotechnology, santa cruz, ca). the
anti-ghrelin antibody speciﬁcally recognizes ghrelin with n-octanoylated
ser3 and does not recognize desacyl-ghrelin [12]. after washing, they were
incubated with second antibody solution of alexa-488 labeled anti-rabbit
igg antibody and alexa-546 labeled donkey anti-goat igg antibody
solution (molecular probes, eugene, or) for 30 min. samples were
observed under ﬂuorescence microscope (akisoskope 2plus, zeiss).
glucagon administration, plasma collection, and tissue resection. rats
were anesthetized with intraperitoneal injection of 1.25 g/kg bw ethyl
carbamate (urethane; tokyo chemical industry, tokyo, japan). for
plasma collection, a heparin-treated cannula was implanted into the gastric vein, and 50 ll of blood was taken every 10 min. after the third collection of blood samples, 3 nmol of glucagon (sigma, st. louis, mo) or
vehicle (200 ll saline) was injected to the femoral vein, and blood was
collected every 10 min for additional 60 min. for tissue resection, 3 nmol
of glucagon or vehicle was injected to the femoral vein, and 50–100 mg of
tissues was resected from the lower body of stomach 5, 20, and 120 min
after injection. glucagon or vehicle administration was performed
between 12:00 and 13:00 h, and animals were decapitated under continuous deep anesthesia after the treatment periods. for tissue resection from
four parts of stomach of intact rats, non-anesthetized rats were decapitated between 10:00 and 15:00 h, and 50–100 mg of tissues was resected
from cardia, upper body, lower body, and pylorus of stomach.
measurement of plasma acyl- and desacyl-ghrelin. blood samples were
quickly transferred into microtubes ﬁlled with 500 kiu/ml aprotinin and
1.25 mg/ml edta–2na, and immediately centrifuged for 4 min. plasma
samples were acidiﬁed with 1:10 volume of 1 m hcl and stored at 80 c
until assay. acyl- and desacyl-ghrelin were measured using the active
ghrelin elisa kit and the desacyl-ghrelin elisa kit, respectively (mitsubishi kagaku iatron, tokyo, japan). these kits use combination of two
monoclonal antibodies raised against the n-terminal of either octanoyl- or
desoctanoyl-ghrelin and against the c-terminal of ghrelin [13].
total rna extraction and cdna synthesis. total rna was extracted
from the tissues using trizol reagent (invitrogen, carlsbad, ca)
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. trace contamination of
dna was removed by dnase i (invitrogen) digestion, and cdna was
synthesized from 500 ng total rna in 20 ll reaction buﬀer including 50 ng

random hexamers and 200 u superscript iii reverse transcriptase (invitrogen). rt-minus negative controls were also prepared.
quantitative pcr. primers used in this study are as follows: glucagon
receptor (accession no. m96674.1; product size, 90 bp), 5 0 -gaca
atatgggattctggtgga-3 0 (forward), 5 0 -aagatgaatgatg
cggacaaag-3 0 (reverse); ghrelin (accession no. nm_021669.1;
product size, 107 bp), 5 0 -aagaggcgccagctaacaag-3 0 (forward),
5 0 -gagtgctgggagttgcagag-3 0 (reverse); hypoxanthine guanine
phosphoribosyl transferase ( xxxg1075xxx ; accession no. nm_012583.2; product size, 138 bp), 50 -cagtcccagcgtcgtgatta-3 0 (forward), 5 0 -gca
agtctttcagtcctgtcca-3 0 (reverse). real-time quantitative pcr was
performed in duplicate in 25 ll reaction buﬀer containing 12.5 ll of power
sybr green pcr master mix (2·) (applied biosystems, foster city,
ca), 200 nm each of forward and reverse primers, and 5 ll of cdna
(diluted 1:30 prior to addition). five microliters of serially diluted cdna
was used as the template for generating standard curves. ampliﬁcation
reactions were performed using abi prism 7000 sequence detection
system (applied biosystems). after 10 min at 95 c, the cycle proﬁles
were 40 cycles of 15 s at 95 c and 1 min at 61 c. expression levels of
 xxxg874xxx  and ghrelin, normalized to those of  xxxg1075xxx  in the
same samples, were calculated as relative values to standardizing
calibrators according to methods described by pfaﬄ [14] and rasmussen
[15]. amplicon size and speciﬁcity were conﬁrmed by melting curve
analysis and 3.5%  xxxg889xxx  agarose gel electrophoresis, and sequences of
amplicons were veriﬁed using bigdye terminator ver.1.1 cycle sequencing
kit and abi prism 3100-avant genetic analyzer (applied biosystems).
data analysis. data are expressed as values of individual rats or
means ± sem of groups. comparisons between groups were performed
using unpaired t test or anova followed by tukey–kramer test for
multiple comparisons. changes in plasma ghrelin levels over time were
analyzed using repeated-measures anova followed by dunnett’s test. a
value of p < 0.05 was considered signiﬁcant.

expression levels were higher in lower body than in pylorus
in all rats, though the diﬀerence was not statistically significant when compared as groups (fig. 1d). ghrelin mrna
was expressed in all parts of stomach (fig. 1a and c). similar to the regional distribution of  xxxg874xxx 
mrna levels, expression levels of ghrelin mrna were signiﬁcantly higher in lower body than in pylorus, upper
body, and cardia by approximately 4.7-, 220-, and 450fold, respectively (fig. 1e).

(fig. 2b) were abundant in lamina propria mucosae of rat
stomach. photographs in higher magniﬁcations reveal that
immunoreactions for acyl-ghrelin were observed throughout cytoplasm (fig. 2d), whereas those for glucagon recep-

tor were detected as spots (fig. 2e). this is probably
because the antibody for  xxxg874xxx  recognizes the
extracellular domain of the receptor molecules that are
expressed in scattered fashions in cell membrane. while
most cells revealed immunoreactions for either acyl-ghrelin
or  xxxg874xxx  alone, a few cells were reactive for
both antibodies (fig. 2c and f).
eﬀects of glucagon on plasma levels of acyl- and desacylghrelin
plasma concentrations of acyl- and desacyl-ghrelin in
the gastric vein at the start of experimental period, at
20 min in fig. 3, were 78.7 ± 17 and 3593 ± 405 fmol/
ml, respectively (means ± sem, n = 8). saline administration did not cause signiﬁcant changes in plasma acyl-ghrelin levels (fig. 3a). desacyl-ghrelin levels revealed
signiﬁcant changes over time by saline administration and
was signiﬁcantly higher at 50 min than at 0 min (fig. 3b).
glucagon, on the other hand, induced signiﬁcant increases

in both acyl- and desacyl-ghrelin levels within 10 min following administration (fig. 3c and d). the increases in
both hormone levels were transient and acyl-ghrelin levels
thereafter remained similar to the basal level at 0 min until
the end of experimental period (fig. 3c). in contrast, desacyl-ghrelin levels gradually rose again from 30 min and
were signiﬁcantly higher than the basal level at 40, 50,
and 60 min (fig. 3d).
eﬀects of glucagon on ghrelin mrna expression in the lower
body of stomach
glucagon induced a signiﬁcant 1.9-fold elevation of the
ghrelin mrna level 20 min after administration, compared
to saline-injected controls. ghrelin mrna levels were not
signiﬁcantly diﬀerent between saline- and glucagon-administer rats at 5 or 120 min (fig. 4a). the baseline of ghrelin
mrna levels, that is, levels in saline-administer rats, signiﬁcantly ascended from 20 min to 120 min by 1.7-fold
(fig. 4b).

discussion
ghrelin-producing cells in the stomach have been identiﬁed mainly from the neck to the base of the oxyntic
glands, especially in the x/a-like cells [12]. the present
study showed that ghrelin mrna was expressed at relatively high levels in lower body and pylorus, and at lower
levels in cardia and upper body of the rat stomach. the
upper body of the rat stomach mostly consists of stratiﬁed
ﬂattened epithelium, while lower body and pylorus consist
of lamina propria mucosae enriched with gastric glands.
the reginal dependency of the ghrelin mrna expression
in the present study is in agreement with the previous ﬁnding. immunohistochemical analyses also conﬁrmed the
expression of acyl-ghrelin predominantly in lamina propria
mucosae of rat stomach.
 xxxg874xxx  mrna is expressed widely throughout rat tissues [16] and its expression is increased by glucose
and somatostatin, whereas it is decreased by glucocorticoids and agents stimulating intracellular camp in rats
[17]. however, little information was available concerning
the regional distribution of  xxxg874xxx  within the
stomach. the present study demonstrated that expression
of  xxxg874xxx  mrna revealed similar regional distribution to that of ghrelin mrna except for little or no
expression in cardia and upper body. the  xxxg874xxx  mrna level in lower body of stomach was lower than
that in liver by approximately 6-fold (data not shown).
immunohistochemical analyses indicated the predominant
expression of the receptor proteins in lamina propria
mucosae of rat stomach. in addition, some stomach cells
appeared to express both acyl-ghrelin and glucagon receptors. the similarity in regional expression proﬁles of ghrelin and  xxxg874xxx  mrnas and the existence of
cells expressing both proteins in the stomach would support a possibility of interactions between ghrelin production and glucagon.
our previous study using free-feeding rats demonstrated
that both acyl- and total ghrelin levels exhibited a diurnal
pattern of release, with bimodal peaks occurring at
15:00 h in the light period and at 06:00 h in the dark period
[6]. the results in the present study are, at least in part,
consistent with these ﬁndings in that ghrelin mrna levels
in stomach tissues from rats c to e (tissue resection at
13:00, 15:00, and 15:00 h, respectively) were totally higher
than those from rats a and b (tissue resection  xxxd1891xxx :00
and 11:30 h, respectively). based on these observations,
eﬀects of glucagon on ghrelin secretion and mrna expression were investigated by glucagon administration between
12:00 and 13:00 h, the period where the plasma ghrelin
level is in an increasing phase. the results suggest that glucagon induces acute and transient increases in the secretion
of both acyl- and desacyl-ghrelin from the stomach. since
ghrelin mrna levels were not changed by glucagon prior
to these increases in hormone secretion, it is likely that glucagon stimulates release, but not synthesis, of both forms
of ghrelin in this period. furthermore, plasma desacyl-

869

ghrelin levels, but not acyl-ghrelin levels, revealed signiﬁcant increases from 40 min after glucagon administration.
this increase in desacyl-ghrelin secretion was accompanied
by a preceding increase in the ghrelin mrna level
observed at 20 min. it is thus suggested that glucagon also
has an ability to increase synthesis and release of desacylghrelin selectively in a prolonged fashion. however, the
increase in ghrelin mrna level by glucagon treatment
was no longer observed 120 min after administration. this
time point corresponds to 14:00–15:00 h, the period exhibiting a peak in the diurnal pattern of plasma ghrelin levels
[6], and the basal level of ghrelin mrna was indeed higher
than that at 20 min after administration. therefore, the
ineﬀectiveness of glucagon on ghrelin mrna expression
at this time point might be due to the end of the increasing
phase of ghrelin production.
recent ﬁndings indicated that promotor activity of
ghrelin gene was stimulated by glucagon and its second
messenger camp [18,19] and that glucagon exerted acute
stimulation of total ghrelin release from the isolated perfused rat stomach [9]. prolonged 3-day treatment of rats
with glucagon was also shown to increase ghrelin mrna
levels in stomach [19]. these results, together with those
in the present study, suggest that glucagon is involved in
ghrelin production and secretion in the stomach.
the concentration of desacyl-ghrelin in the gastric vein
was higher than that of acyl-ghrelin by 45-fold, which is
consistent with previous observations [2,6]. the interpretation of the physiological signiﬁcance of the stimulatory
eﬀect of glucagon on desacyl-ghrelin secretion is diﬃcult.
regulatory mechanisms of octanoylation and des-octanoylation of ghrelin are unclear. while n-octanoylation at ser3
residue of the molecule is essential for the expression of
biological activities of ghrelin though  xxxg894xxx  [1], recent
studies have presented biological eﬀects of non-octanoylated desacyl-ghrelin through pathways independent of  xxxg894xxx . administration of desacyl-ghrelin was demonstrated to
inhibit food intake via signaling through corticotropinreleasing factor 2 receptor in rats [20]. on the contrary,
central but not peripheral administration of desacyl-ghrelin
was shown to induce food intake in rats [21]. the eﬀect of
desacyl-ghrelin on food intake is therefore obscure so far.
from the results in the present study, a question may
remain why saline administration caused slight but signiﬁcant changes over time in plasma levels of desacyl-ghrelin.
since electrical vagal stimulation in isolated perfused rat
stomach has been reported to lead to consistent elevation
of total ghrelin secretion [22], it is possible that vagal stimulation occurred during surgical treatments and/or blood
collection and such an artiﬁcial eﬀect led to the elevation
of desacyl-ghrelin secretion. if this is the case, it might be
assumed that modes of vagal regulation on acyl- and desacyl-ghrelin are dintinct since little elevation was observed in
acyl-ghrelin levels in the same rats.
in summary, the present study has shown that glucagon
receptor mrna is expressed with similar regional distribution as that of ghrelin in the rat stomach. furthermore,

870

biphasic eﬀects of glucagon on ghrelin secretion have been
suggested, that is, stimulating acute release of both forms
of ghrelin and thereafter upregulating systhesis and release
of desacyl-ghrelin selectively in the rat stomach. since
physiological eﬀects of desacyl-ghrelin especially on food
intake remain to be controversial, further studies are
required to elucidate the physiological role of glucagon as
a regulator of ghrelin secretion.
