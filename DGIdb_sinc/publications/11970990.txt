espite progress in the clinical development of mabs and
igg fusion proteins as therapeutics, the mechanism(s)
contributing to their efficacy and patient responsiveness
is still largely undefined (reviewed in refs. 1 and 2). although
initial evaluations of ig-based therapeutics focused on antagonism
or agonism of cellular processes mediated upon ligation of the
targeted ligand, it is now apparent that the fc regions of ig-based
agents also may contribute to their biological activity (3, 4). thus,
both regions may be engineered to enhance the therapeutics’ pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics to maximize efficacy. more
specifically, chemical and genetic modifications can be made to
alter the specificity/affinity of binding: 1) to ligand on target cells
(5) and 2) of the ig fc domains to complement, fcrn, and fcr
(6 –9). the three classes of differentially expressed igg fc receptors are functionally of two types: the multimeric activation receptors fc␥ri ( xxxg770xxx ) and fc␥riii ( xxxg775xxx   xxxg776xxx ) comprised of both an
fc-binding and a signaling subunit (the immunoreceptor tyrosinebased activation motif), and a inhibitory receptor, monomeric
fc␥rii (cd32), containing an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motif (6). in this context rational design of the igg fc
domains of therapeutics can thus select for or against the recruit-

ment of indirect host effects, such as the release of inflammatory
cytokines, immune regulation, ag presentation, target cell death
(e.g., complement-dependent cytotoxicity (necrosis) or ab-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (apoptosis)), endocytosis, and
phagocytosis (4, 6). moreover, engineering of igg-based therapeutics may address patient-specific factors, such as ligand or fc
receptor polymorphisms, which potentially may differ in control
and diseased populations and are likely to be reflected in therapeutic efficacy in vivo. this has been suggested for the therapeutic
mabs herceptin and rituxan (both from genentech, south san
francisco, ca), specific for the signaling receptors c- xxxg682xxx -2 and
cd20, respectively (10 –12). initially it was postulated that the
therapeutic activities of these mabs might derive solely from the
agonistic or antagonistic functions mediated upon binding of their
complementarity-determining regions to their molecular target on
cells. more recent data from experimental models suggest that the
molecular mechanism(s) underlying the biologic activities of herceptin and rituxan (4) and  xxxd105xxx , the  xxxg377xxx  receptor-specific
therapeutic  xxxg395xxx /igg1 fusion protein (13, 14), may also reside
with igg fc-recruited host effector functions, including the activation of apoptosis and ig-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (e.g.,
adcc). as such, clinical and experimental exploration of the relative benefits of human fc␥ isoforms of such therapeutic constructs that differ with regard to their ability to mediate effector
functions are prescribed.
 xxxd105xxx  (human  xxxg395xxx /igg1 fusion protein), previously referred to as  xxxd105xxx , is an immunomodulatory recombinant fusion protein composed of the first extracellular domain of  xxxg395xxx 
fused to the human igg1 hinge, ch2, and ch3 domains (13).
 xxxg395xxx  ( xxxg395xxx ) is the primary physiologic ligand for human  xxxg377xxx 
and is expressed on many cell types, including apcs (reviewed in
ref. 15). in contrast, human  xxxg377xxx  has a more restricted distribution,

 xxxd105xxx , an immunomodulatory recombinant fusion protein composed of the first extracellular domain of  xxxg395xxx  fused to the
human igg1 hinge, ch2, and ch3 domains, has recently been shown in phase ii and iii clinical trials to safely reduce disease
expression in patients with chronic plaque psoriasis.  xxxd105xxx  modulates the function of and selectively induces apoptosis of cd2ⴙ
human memory-effector t cells in vivo. we have sought to gain further understanding of the mechanisms of action that influence
the biological activity of  xxxd105xxx  and may contribute to its efficacy and patient responsiveness. specifically evaluated is the ability
of  xxxd105xxx  to activate intracellular signals mediated via  xxxg377xxx  and/or fc␥riii ( xxxg775xxx   xxxg776xxx ). experimentation using isoforms of  xxxd105xxx 
engineered to have amino acid substitutions in the igg1 ch2 domain that impact fc␥r binding indicate that  xxxd105xxx  mediates
cognate interactions between cells expressing human  xxxg377xxx  and  xxxg775xxx   xxxg776xxx  to activate cells, e.g., increase extracellular signal-regulated
kinase phosphorylation, up-regulate cell surface expression of the activation marker cd25, and induce release of granzyme b. in
the systems used, this signaling is shown to require binding to  xxxg377xxx  and  xxxg775xxx   xxxg776xxx  and be mediated through  xxxg775xxx   xxxg776xxx , but not  xxxg377xxx .
experimentation using human  xxxg377xxx -transgenic mice and isoforms of  xxxd105xxx  confirmed the requirement for fc␥r binding for
detection of the pharmacological effects of  xxxd105xxx  in vivo. thus  xxxd105xxx  acts as an effector molecule, mediating cognate
interactions to activate fc␥rⴙ cells (e.g., nk cells) to induce apoptosis of sensitive cd2ⴙ target cells. the journal of immunology,

materials and methods
cells
human pbl were separated from freshly drawn blood using ficollhypaque (icn biomedicals, aurora, oh) gradient centrifugation, as previously described (14). nk cells were then enriched using  xxxd2676xxx -coated
magnetic beads and a miltenyi biotec macs column, following the manufacturer’s instructions (miltenyi, auburn, ca). up to 1 ⫻ 109 pbl were
bound to the  xxxd2676xxx -coated beads and passed over the macs column.
the cd3⫺ cells were collected, washed, and run over the same column.
the yield of cd3⫺ cells was approximately 10%. this population was
cultured (50,000 –100,000 cells/well) with irradiated feeders (200,000/well
human pbls exposed to 3000 rad) in wells of 96-well, round-bottom plates
using iscove’s (life technologies, grand island, ny), 10% ab-matched
human serum (biowhittaker, walkersville, md), 1% glutamine, 1% penicillin/streptomycin (life technologies), 5.0 ␮g/ml pha (difco, detroit,
mi), and 100 u/ml ril-2 (r&d systems, minneapolis, mn). cells were
fed on day 2 and restimulated on day 5 with irradiated feeders using medium without pha, but with 5% (v/v) purified il-2 (hemagen, columbia,
md). cells were fed every other day until growth in the well was obvious,
at which time cells were split 1:1. nk cell culture can continue up to
approximately 30 days after the initiation of culture. phenotypic analyses
of in vitro-cultured nk cells demonstrated that the cells were ⬎90% nk
cells ( xxxg377xxx ⫹, cd56⫹,  xxxg775xxx   xxxg776xxx  (fc␥riii)⫹, cd3⫺; data not shown) at approximately 2–3 wk after the initiation of culture. t cells were also prepared by culturing  xxxd3253xxx -hypaque gradient-separated human pbl (2 ⫻
106/ml) with  xxxd2676xxx  (10 ng/ml) in complete rpmi (life technologies) for
3 days. cells were then split 1:1 using complete rpmi supplemented with
recombinant human il-2 (5 ng/ml). after 2 additional days of culture, cells
were used for cell death studies. cultures were maintained in the il-2supplemented medium for up to 21 days.

cell lines
the u937 monocytic cell line expressing  xxxg770xxx  (fc␥ri) and cd32
(fc␥rii) and the  xxxg377xxx ⫹ cho transfectants have been described previously
(14). the  xxxg377xxx ⫹cd3⫹ xxxg775xxx   xxxg776xxx ⫺ jurkat tumor t cell line was originally obtained from dr. steve burakoff (dana-farber cancer institute, boston,
ma).  xxxg377xxx ⫹cd3⫺ xxxg775xxx   xxxg776xxx ⫹ (fc␥riii⫹) jurkat cells, obtained from dr. paul
anderson (dana-farber cancer institute, boston, ma), have been described previously (14, 26). subsequently, variants of jurkat cells were
generated by transfecting the  xxxg377xxx ⫹cd3⫹ xxxg775xxx   xxxg776xxx ⫺ jurkat e6- 1 clone
(atcc tib-152; american type culture collection, manassas, va) with
a  xxxg775xxx   xxxg776xxx  cdna inserted into the pef-bos-derived vector (27). the  xxxg775xxx   xxxg776xxx 

cdna was generated by rt-pcr from rna extracted from the  xxxg775xxx   xxxg776xxx ⫹
jurkat cells (26). cotransfections were conducted by electroporation of the
 xxxg775xxx   xxxg776xxx  construct with a vector carrying the neomycin resistance gene (pgxn28) for positive selection. stable transfectants were isolated and expanded by selection with  xxxd2191xxx  ( xxxg418xxx  sulfate). the cells were then
sorted by facs to isolate populations observed to be phenotypically
 xxxg377xxx ⫺cd3⫹ xxxg775xxx   xxxg776xxx ⫹ or  xxxg377xxx ⫹cd3⫹ xxxg775xxx   xxxg776xxx ⫺. the expressed recombinant
 xxxg775xxx   xxxg776xxx  is expected to form a heterodimeric receptor complex with the tcr
␨-chain to allow for  xxxg775xxx   xxxg776xxx -generated signaling cascades (6, 26). these cells
were transiently transfected with a reporter gene construct (nfat-luciferase; clontech, palo alto, ca) and assayed as described below.

fusion proteins
 xxxd105xxx  is composed of the first extracellular domain of  xxxg395xxx  fused to
the hinge, ch2 domain, and ch3 domain of human igg1. its construction,
expression, and purification have been described previously (13). constructs encoding fusion proteins identical with  xxxd105xxx , but with mutations encoding amino acids substitutions at  xxxd105xxx  positions 106, 107,
and 109, which correspond to amino acid positions 234, 235, and 237
(according to european union numbering) of the human igg1 ch2 domain, or only at  xxxd105xxx  position 107 (amino acid 235 of human igg1)
were also prepared. these constructs, designated ca139 and l107e, respectively, were expressed transiently in cho-s cells, and the proteins
derived were purified on a protein a column (amersham/pharmacia, piscataway, nj). the concentration was determined as the absorbance at 280
nm divided by the extinction coefficient (1.47). ca139 has the following
amino acid substitutions in the  xxxd105xxx  igg1 ch2 domain: leucine to
alanine at  xxxd105xxx  position 106, leucine to  xxxd2431xxx  at position 107,
and glycine to alanine at position 109. l107e has only the leucine to
 xxxd2431xxx  substitution at  xxxd105xxx  position 107. a lymphotoxin ␤ receptor (lt␤r)/igg1 fusion protein possessing the same human igg1 fc
hinge, ch2, and ch3 regions as  xxxd105xxx  was employed as a control in the
studies herein (28).

antibodies
the human  xxxg377xxx -specific mabs gd10 and cb6, both murine igg1, were
prepared at biogen (cambridge, ma) using standard techniques. briefly,
rbf mice were immunized via the i.p. route simultaneously with cfa and
4 ⫻ 106 cho transfectants expressing human  xxxg377xxx . mice were boosted
five times via the i.p. route at 2- to 3-wk intervals with both 4 ⫻ 106  xxxg377xxx ⫹
cho transfectants and ifa. three days after the fifth boost, mice with sera
exhibiting human  xxxg377xxx -specific abs received an i.p. injection of  xxxg377xxx ⫹
cho transfectants and were then sacrificed, and their spleen cells were
harvested and fused to  xxxg179xxx -p3x.653 myeloma cells. after hybridomas
were selected in medium containing adenine-aminopterin-thymidine, hybridoma supernatants were screened for binding to  xxxg377xxx ⫹ jurkat cells. selected hybridoma subclones were grown in balb/c mice as ascetic tumors, and abs were purified by protein a-sepharose chromatography
following standard procedures. the agonist human cd3-specific mab
 xxxd2676xxx  is a murine igg2a (atcc). the agonist anti- xxxg775xxx   xxxg776xxx  mab (murine
igg1, clone 3g8) was purchased from bd pharmingen (san diego, ca)
and medarex (annandale, nj). the fas ( xxxg764xxx )-specific murine igm mab
ch11 was purchased from kamiya biomedical (seattle, wa). the blocking human  xxxg377xxx  specific mab ts2/18 was gift from dr. t. springer (harvard medical school, boston, ma). a murine igg1 and the control
mopc21, a murine igg1, were purchased from sigma (st. louis, mo).

human  xxxg377xxx ⫹ transgenic mice
male and female 2- to 3-mo-old transgenic mice expressing one copy of the
human  xxxg377xxx  gene received one i.v. injection of a 100-␮l volume of fusion
protein. mice were bled on the day after injection. pbl were stained using
fitc-conjugated abs specific for human  xxxg377xxx  (leu 5b; bd biosciences,
san diego, ca) and murine cd3 (mab 145-2c11, purchased from pharmingen), which are t cell markers, and with a fitc-conjugated ab specific for murine igm (jackson immunoresearch laboratory, west grove,
pa), which is a marker for b cells. cell staining was evaluated by flow
cytometry.

flow cytometry
binding assays were performed as described previously (19). in vitro  xxxg1173xxx -expanded nk cells (3 ⫻ 105) were incubated at room temperature for 30
min with various concentrations of  xxxd105xxx  as indicated in the figure or
with commercially available cd-specific mab reagents to which a fluorescent tag was directly conjugated. to detect  xxxd105xxx  binding, cells were
then washed twice with pbs and 0.5% bsa and incubated with a 1/200

being detected primarily on t cells and nk cells (reviewed in ref.
16), with elevated expression noted on activated or memory-effector
cd45ro⫹ t cells (17–19). engagement of  xxxg377xxx  on responder t or
nk cells by  xxxg395xxx  on accessory cells costimulates immune responses
potentially by improving the avidity of cellular interactions or by mediating activating signals in the responder cells (15, 16). indeed, anticd2 mabs and soluble forms of  xxxg395xxx , including  xxxg395xxx /igg1 fusion proteins, have been shown to costimulate t cell activation and
proliferation under certain experimental conditions (20, 21). additionally, however, both  xxxd105xxx  and abs specific for human  xxxg377xxx  and
human  xxxg395xxx  have been shown to inhibit t cell activities in vitro and
in vivo (13, 14, 22). recently,  xxxd105xxx  as a monotherapy has been
shown in phase ii and iii clinical trials to reduce disease expression
safely in patients with chronic plaque psoriasis (23) (m. lebwohl, e.
christophers, r. langley, j.-p. ortonne, j. roberts, c. e. m. griffiths,
and the  xxxd105xxx  clinical study group, manuscript in preparation
and g. krueger, k. papp, d. stough, k. loven, w. gulliver, c. ellis,
and the  xxxd105xxx  clinical study group, manuscript in preparation),
consistent with reports that t cells are central to the underlying pathogenesis (24, 25). the clinical trial data show that  xxxd105xxx  targets the
memory-effector cd45ro⫹ t cells thought to be responsible for disease activity and induces sustained remissions that are maintained
even after therapy is withdrawn. herein, we report investigations evaluating the biological activities of  xxxd105xxx  by employing wild-type
and fc␥ isoforms of  xxxd105xxx  in vitro and in vivo to gain understanding of mechanisms that may contribute to the efficacy of and patient
responsiveness to  xxxd105xxx .

dilution of pe-conjugated goat anti- xxxd2207xxx  (jackson immunoresearch
laboratories) for 30 min at room temperature. cells were then washed
twice, fixed with 1% paraformaldehyde, and analyzed by flow cytometry
using a facscalibur flow cytometer (bd biosciences). ten thousand
events were monitored. reagents specific for human  xxxg377xxx ,  xxxg775xxx   xxxg776xxx , cd3,
cd25, cd69, and fas ( xxxg764xxx ) used for flow cytometry were purchased
from pharmingen. to detect nk cells, pbl were stained with fitc-conjugated mouse anti-human  xxxg775xxx   xxxg776xxx  and cychrome-conjugated mouse antihuman cd56 (bd pharmingen). data are expressed as the median fluorescent channel intensity.

elisa for granzyme b

 xxxd105xxx -mediated bridging assay
bridging assays were performed as described previously (14). cho cells
transfected with human  xxxg377xxx  were grown to confluence in wells of flatbottom, 96-well plates. wells were washed twice, 50 ␮l of varying concentrations of fusion protein were added, and plates were incubated for 30
min at 37°c. one hundred thousand u937 cells (expressing  xxxg770xxx  and
cd32) or 105  xxxg775xxx   xxxg776xxx ⫹ jurkat cells labeled with 2-7-bis-(2-carboxyethyl)5-(and-6)-carboxyfluorescein acetoxymethyl ester (molecular probes, eugene, or) according to the manufacturer’s directions were then added in
50 ␮l to wells. plates were incubated for 30 min at 37°c. wells were then
washed up to four times. background signal was that of wells with cells but
without added fusion protein, incubated and washed as were the experimental groups. total input signal was defined as the fluorescence signal
released from 105 bcecf-am-labeled cells. the percent binding was determined as the (observed ⫺ background)/(total input ⫺ background)
fluorescence ⫻ 100.

of released lactic dehydrogenase (ldh)3 according to kit instructions, and
absorbance was read at 490 nm in a molecular devices spectramax plus
plate reader. spontaneous release (sr) is ldh released from the cells in
the presence of medium alone, and maximum release was that released
from the cells incubated in the presence of 9% triton x-100. percent lysis
was calculated as ((experimental ⫺ sr)/(maximum release ⫺ sr)) ⫻ 100.
concanamycin a (sequoia, st. louis, mo), an inhibitor of vacuolar type
h⫹-atpase thus perforin-based cytotoxic activity (30), was employed at a
50-nm concentration. granzyme b-mediated cell death is referred to herein
as apoptosis (contrasting with necrosis mediated by the complement membrane attack complex), as it is known to activate the caspase cascade in
target cells to cause cell death.

p42/44mapk (extracellular signal-regulated kinase (erk))
activation assay
jurkat cells (2 ⫻ 106 cells in 1 ml rpmi medium with 2% fbs) were
treated in vitro for 12 min at 37°c with either fusion proteins or mabs as
indicated in the figure legends. following stimulation, cells were sedimented by brief centrifugation, and the pellet was resuspended in 100 ␮l of
a hypotonic solution (10 mm tris and 1 mm edta buffer). after addition
of an equal volume of gel loading buffer, cell extracts were separated by
12.5% sds-page and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes
(millipore, bedford, ma), and the samples were subjected to immunoblotting with phospho-specific abs to p42/44mapk specific for activated kinase. blots were developed using the ecl system and were visualized by
exposure to x-ray film. autoradiographs were scanned using a
densitometer.

luciferase reporter assays
cells (2 ⫻ 107 cells in 400 ␮l) were transfected with 80 ␮g pnfatluciferase reporter gene construct (stratagene, la jolla, ca) and then diluted into 20 ml rpmi medium supplemented with 10% fbs and incubated (5% co2, 37°c) overnight. to measure the induction of luciferase
expression, cells were treated with either a combination of pma (calbiotech, la jolla, ca) and  xxxd2379xxx  (calbiotech) at concentrations of 0.1
and 5 ␮g/ml, respectively, or with mabs and fusion proteins in wells of a
96-well, round-bottom well plate. following 4 – 6 h of incubation (5% co2,
37°c), the plate was centrifuged (800 ⫻ g for 5 min), the cells were lysed
in 100 ␮l of 1⫻ reporter lysis buffer (promega, madison, wi) for 10 min
while being shaken at room temperature. the cell lysates (40 ␮l) were
transferred into wells of a white  xxxd2988xxx , 75 ␮l luciferase substrate was
added to each well, and after 1 s the luminescence was counted for 1 s
using a microbeta jet reader (wallac, gaithersburg, md). the data are
expressed as corrected light units per second (clps). the signal was normalized by dividing the clps values for each experimental well by the
average clps value of the  xxxd2676xxx -treated sample and then multiplied by
100. thus, the signals are represented as a percentage of the cd3-stimulated signal.

t cell proliferation assays

ribonuclease protection assays (rpas)

human pbl (1–2 ⫻ 105/well) were suspended in complete medium (rpmi
1640 supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fbs, 1% hepes, 1% penicillin (100,000 u/ml), 1% streptomycin (10,000 ␮g/ml), and 2% glutamine (200 mmol/l)) and cultured in 96-well microtiter plates. pha or
irradiated (10,000 rad) human allogeneic jy tumor b cells serving as apc
were added, and plates were incubated at 37°c in 5% co2. mlr were
incubated for a total of 6 days. pha-induced proliferation assays were
incubated for a total of 3 days. wells were pulsed with 1 ␮ci tritiated
thymidine ([3h]tdr; amersham) for 18 h before harvesting cells onto
glass-fiber filters using a mash harvester (tomtec, orange, ct). radioactivity incorporated was measured using a liquid scintillation counter
(wallac, gaithersburg, md).

il-2-expanded nk cells were incubated for 48 h in fresh medium containing 5% il-2 (purified), after which they were incubated with the various
mabs and fusion proteins in the same conditioned medium. thirty ⫻ 106
cells were used per experimental condition. after 4 h of incubation at 37°c,
cells were harvested, and rna was extracted (qiagen, valencia, ca). to
perform the rpas, 10 ␮g of each rna sample was then hybridized overnight separately with three [33p]dctp (amersham)-labeled probe sets:
huck-1 (cytokines), and apo-3 and apo-4 (apoptotic genes) as indicated
by the manufacturer (bd pharmingen). the rna/probe hybrids were then
treated with  xxxg1963xxx  to digest unprotected rna. after proteinase k treatment, the rnase digests were phenol extracted once, precipitated with
ethanol, and separated by quickpoint acrylamide gel electrophoresis
(novex, san diego, ca). labeled probes were visualized by autoradiography, and the intensity of the signal was measured with a storm 860
phosphorimager scanner (molecular dynamics, sunnyvale, ca). hybridization signals for the individual mrna species were then normalized
against the mean value obtained for the  xxxg861xxx / xxxg1980xxx  signals (⫻100)
within each experimental sample. hence, the detected expression levels for
the genes of interest are expressed relative to the expression levels observed for two housekeeping genes. individual mrna species were identified against labeled standards following the manufacturer’s procedures.

cell death assays
cell death was measured by flow cytometry or in standard cell-mediated
cytotoxicity assays. death of in vitro il-2 expanded nk or t cells or of
jurkat cells, which had been stimulated as described in results, was detected by staining with fitc-annexin followed by flow cytometric analyses. cell death was also measured in nonradioactive standard cell-mediated
cytotoxicity assays using a commercially available kit (cytotox96; promega, madison, wi). briefly, 30,000 nk cells in 0.1 ml were added to
wells of round-bottom, 96-well microtiter plates. fusion proteins were
added to wells at the concentrations shown in the figures to make a total
volume of 0.2 ml/well. the microtiter plates were incubated (37°c, 5%
co2) for 4 h, and then 0.05 ml supernatant was removed for measurement

an elisa for detection of granzyme b in supernatants derived from stimulated nk cells was based on that previously reported (29). briefly, purified mab gb11 (research diagnostics, flanders, nj) specific for granzyme b was coated (50 mm  xxxd3212xxx /bicarbonate coating buffer,
ph 9.6, 16 h at 4°c) on the wells of nunc polysorp immunoplate (copenhagen, denmark). following washing (pbs/0.05% tween 20 and blocking
(pbs/2% (w/v) milk, 1 h at room temperature), purified granzyme b (calbiochem, la jolla, ca) as a standard and samples that had been treated
with hyaluronidase (sigma; 40 ␮g/ml for 30 min at room temperature) and
diluted in pbs were added (100 ␮l/well), and plates were incubated for 2 h
at room temperature. following washing, the detecting granzyme b-specific ab, biotinylated gb10 mab (0.5 ␮g/ml in pbs/1% normal mouse
serum) was added, and plates were incubated for 1 h. following another

1b). these data are consistent with published results (19) showing
that high avidity binding at the lower  xxxd105xxx  concentrations reflects binding to both  xxxg377xxx  and  xxxg775xxx   xxxg776xxx , and low affinity binding at
higher  xxxd105xxx  concentrations reflects  xxxg395xxx  binding to
 xxxg377xxx  only.
next we tested the ability of  xxxd105xxx , ca139, or l107e to
mediate intercellular bridging of plate-adherent  xxxg377xxx ⫹ cho transfectants to fluorescently labeled  xxxg770xxx ⫹ cd32⫹ (fc␥ri and
fc␥rii, respectively) u937 cells or  xxxg775xxx   xxxg776xxx ⫹ (fc␥riii)-transfected
jurkat cells (14). as shown in fig. 1c,  xxxd105xxx  mediates intercellular bridging, whereas both ca139 and l107e failed to bridge
in assays employing u937 cells. in contrast, both  xxxd105xxx  and
l107e mediated intercellular bridging of  xxxg775xxx   xxxg776xxx ⫹ jurkat cells to
 xxxg377xxx ⫹ cho transfectants, and ca139 failed to bridge  xxxg775xxx   xxxg776xxx ⫹ jurkat cells to  xxxg377xxx ⫹ cho transfectants (fig. 1d). thus, the mutations in ca139 abrogated bridging of  xxxg377xxx ⫹ cells to either
 xxxg770xxx ⫹cd32⫹ cells or  xxxg775xxx   xxxg776xxx ⫹ cells, whereas the mutation in

to investigate the role of the igg1 fc portion and cell-expressed
fc␥r (particularly fc␥riii,  xxxg775xxx   xxxg776xxx ) in the functional activity of
 xxxd105xxx , two isoforms expressing mutations in the human igg1
ch2 domain of the fusion protein were generated. these isoforms,
designated l107e and ca139, were mutated, respectively, at igg1
h chain aa position 235 only or at 234, 235, and 237 (employing
the european union nomenclature). these amino acid substitutions are expected to abrogate binding to fc␥r (31, 32). initial
experiments compared the binding of  xxxd105xxx  and ca139 to
freshly drawn human peripheral blood t cells or to in vitro il-2expanded human nk cells that express  xxxg377xxx  and  xxxg775xxx   xxxg776xxx  (fig. 1, a
and b, respectively). bound fusion proteins were detected using
flow cytometry. the concentration range for saturation binding
was not addressed in these experiments, as equilibrium conditions
were  xxxd3237xxx . the shapes of the binding profiles of  xxxd105xxx  and ca139 to t cells (detected in fig. 1a as
 xxxg377xxx ⫹ xxxg775xxx   xxxg776xxx ⫺cd56⫺ peripheral blood cells) were similar in that
binding is detected primarily at high (⬎100 ␮g/ml) and less so at
lower (1–100 ␮g/ml)  xxxd105xxx  concentrations. in contrast,  xxxd105xxx  binds to the in vitro cultured nk cells (which are
 xxxg377xxx ⫹ xxxg775xxx   xxxg776xxx ⫹, fig. 1b) at high as well as lower concentrations.
ca139 (which binds  xxxg377xxx , but not  xxxg775xxx   xxxg776xxx ; see below) appears to
bind better at higher and less well at the lower fusion protein concentrations. the binding of both fusion proteins (at all concentra-

had little effect. this pattern confirms a role for  xxxg775xxx   xxxg776xxx  binding as
well as  xxxg377xxx  binding in  xxxd105xxx  inhibition of t cell proliferation
(14). as t and b cells do not express  xxxg775xxx   xxxg776xxx , it is likely that the

of human  xxxg377xxx  transgenic mice to remove nk cells did not abrogate  xxxd105xxx ’s activity (14), other fc␥r⫹ murine cells, e.g., macrophages, may also mediate  xxxd105xxx ’s effect on t cells in
these mice.

as the studies reported above and previously show a role for

and potentially macrophages in  xxxd105xxx ’s effects on t cell proliferation in vitro and on peripheral t cell counts in vivo, it was of
interest to evaluate the effect of the fusion protein directly on
 xxxg775xxx   xxxg776xxx -expressing cells. for this purpose we employed a homogeneous population of primary cells that express  xxxg775xxx   xxxg776xxx , which are
capable of lytic function. specifically, the effect of  xxxd105xxx  and its
mutant isoforms on in vitro propagated  xxxg775xxx   xxxg776xxx ⫹ xxxg377xxx ⫹ nk cells
was examined. initially,  xxxd105xxx  was tested for its ability to induce apoptosis of human nk or t cells. relatively homogeneous
preparations of in vitro il-2-expanded nk or t cells were incubated with various concentrations of  xxxd105xxx , ca139, anti- xxxg775xxx   xxxg776xxx 
mab, or their isotype controls, human lt␤r/igg1 fc-fusion protein (lt␤r/igg1), and mopc21. following incubation, the cells
were collected and stained with fitc-conjugated  xxxg166xxx . an
increase in the percentage of cells binding  xxxg166xxx  represents an
increase in apoptotic cells, as  xxxg166xxx  binds  xxxd1857xxx ,
which is known to flip from the inner to the outer membrane of the
cytoplasmic membrane when cells undergo apoptosis. as shown in
table ii, incubation of nk cells with  xxxd105xxx  or the  xxxg775xxx   xxxg776xxx -specific mab, but not ca139, lt␤r/igg1, or mopc21, resulted in a
substantial increase in the percentage of nk cells that bind annexin

with regard to  xxxd105xxx ’s effects on t cells in vivo, it has previously been shown that a single injection of ⱖ50 ␮g (⬃2.5 mg/kg)
 xxxd105xxx  into human  xxxg377xxx  transgenic mice diminished human
 xxxg377xxx ⫹ murine t cells in the blood and secondary lymphoid tissues
by a mechanism that does not require complement but is dependent
on the expression of the igg1 ch2 domain by the fusion protein
(14). human  xxxg377xxx  transgenic mice were used, as the endogenous
murine  xxxg377xxx  does not bind human  xxxg395xxx  expressed in  xxxd105xxx 
(14); in fact, the receptor for murine  xxxg377xxx  is murine cd48 (33),
and an  xxxg395xxx ( xxxg395xxx ) equivalent has not been identified in mice.
the data from a representative experiment (table i) show that
administration of 50 ␮g  xxxd105xxx  or l107e eliminated peripheral
human  xxxg377xxx ⫹ t cells from human  xxxg377xxx ⫹ transgenic mice. the
percentage of peripheral blood (human  xxxg377xxx ⫹, murine cd3⫹) t
cells observed on days 2 and 3 postdosing was 0 or 1%, compared
with approximately 35% human  xxxg377xxx ⫹ and murine cd3⫹ t cells
in untreated mice. the percentage of pbl that were igm⫹ b cells
was ⬎85% in the  xxxd105xxx - and l107e-treated mice compared
with approximately 50% in untreated mice, showing a corresponding increase in the percentage of b cells as the t cell counts decreased. in contrast, administration of ca139 to human  xxxg377xxx  transgenic mice had no effect on peripheral t cell counts. elisa
analyses of plasma samples taken from the mice at the time of the
flow cytometric analyses showed approximately equivalent fusion
protein concentrations (data not shown). thus, ca139, which
binds to  xxxg377xxx , but not to human,  xxxg770xxx , cd32, and  xxxg775xxx   xxxg776xxx , fails to
reduce, whereas the l107e mutant, which binds human  xxxg377xxx  and
human  xxxg775xxx   xxxg776xxx , is able to reduce peripheral t cell counts in human
 xxxg377xxx  transgenic mice comparably to  xxxd105xxx . thus, this in vivo
effect of  xxxd105xxx  on peripheral t cells requires that the fusion
protein bind to cells that express the murine homologue of human

jurkat cells were cultured for 72 h with the reagents at the concentrations indicated. cells were collected and stained with fluoresceinated  xxxg166xxx  and analyzed

 xxxd105xxx  induces activation of and intracellular signaling in in
vitro il-2-expanded nk cells that is dependent on  xxxg377xxx  and
 xxxg775xxx   xxxg776xxx  binding.
we next considered that  xxxd105xxx -mediated apoptosis of nk cells
(fig. 2) may reflect activation-induced intracellular processes similar to the apoptosis of il-2-activated nk cells stimulated by anticd16 mab (35) or anti- xxxg377xxx  mabs (36, 37). thus, we investigated
whether  xxxd105xxx  has agonistic properties. nk cells were incubated with 10 ␮g/ml  xxxd105xxx  or control proteins for 20 h in the
presence of il-2 and then analyzed by flow cytometry for the
expression of activation markers cd25, and  xxxg764xxx  (fas). the results show that incubation of nk cells with  xxxd105xxx , anti- xxxg377xxx 
mabs, or anti- xxxg775xxx   xxxg776xxx  mab, but not ca139 or lt␤r/igg1, resulted
in up-regulation of the expression of cd25 (fig. 2b, upper panel),
but not  xxxg764xxx  (fig. 2b, lower panel), which is already highly expressed by these in vitro il-2 expanded nk cells (fig. 2b, lower
panel). such an agonistic effect of  xxxd105xxx  on il-2-expanded human t cells was not noted (data not shown).

v. in a parallel experiment using the homogeneous preparations of
il-2-expanded t cells (that lack  xxxg775xxx   xxxg776xxx  expression on the surface),
the t cell population was induced to undergo apoptosis by  xxxd412xxx  and fas- or  xxxg377xxx -specific mabs, but not by either  xxxd105xxx  or ca139 (data not shown). this indicates that  xxxd105xxx  is
able to induce apoptosis of in vitro il-2-expanded nk cells, but
not that of in vitro il-2-expanded t cells. as the  xxxg775xxx   xxxg776xxx -specific
mab, but not the control lt␤r/igg1 fusion protein or ca139,
also induced nk cell apoptosis, the data indicate that  xxxg775xxx   xxxg776xxx  binding by mab alone is sufficient to mediate such activity, but that
 xxxd105xxx  must bind both  xxxg377xxx  and  xxxg775xxx   xxxg776xxx  to mediate its effect.
similarly, but less impressively, in studies employing jurkat cells,
 xxxg377xxx ⫹ xxxg377xxx ⫹ xxxg775xxx   xxxg776xxx ⫹ jurkat transfectants incubated with  xxxd105xxx ,
but not ca139, were induced to undergo apoptosis (table iii). in
contrast, jurkat cells expressing  xxxg377xxx , but not  xxxg775xxx   xxxg776xxx , were not
induced by  xxxd105xxx  to undergo apoptosis (table iii).
the molecular mechanisms contributing to  xxxd105xxx -induced
apoptosis of sensitive  xxxg377xxx ⫹ cells were evaluated. first, the ability
of  xxxd105xxx  to induce nk cells to secrete granzyme b was assessed. the results shown in table ii demonstrate that the addition
of various concentrations of  xxxd105xxx  or the  xxxg775xxx   xxxg776xxx -specific mab,
but not ca139 or lt␤r/igg1, to cultures of nk cells induces the
secretion of granzyme b. to evaluate whether this may contribute
to  xxxd105xxx -stimulated nk cell apoptosis, concanamycin a was
used in 4-h cytotoxicity assays. concanamycin a is an inhibitor of
vacuolar type h⫹-atpase and inhibits perforin-based cytotoxic
activity primarily due to accelerated degradation of perforin by an
increase in the ph of lytic granules. in a representative experiment
shown in fig. 2a, il-2-expanded nk cells were incubated with
 xxxd105xxx  or the control protein lt␤r/igg1 for 4 h in the presence
or the absence of concanamycin a, and cytotoxicity was measured
as an increase in the release of ldh by the nk cells. the data
show that concanamycin a almost completely inhibited alefaceptinduced nk cell death detected in 4-h cytotoxicity assays. thus, in
these il-2-expanded nk cells,  xxxd105xxx  appears to induce apoptosis by a mechanism that is mediated primarily by granzyme b.
by contrast concanamycin a only partially reduced nk cell lysis
of k562 target cells (data not shown), consistent with published
data suggesting that nk cell-mediated lysis of k562 cells reflects
the activity of both the perforin/granzyme b and the  xxxd3135xxx /fas
death receptor pathways (34). attempts to investigate the induction
of caspase activity in response to  xxxd105xxx  or control fusion proteins or mabs were difficult due to high levels of endogenous

 xxxg395xxx /igg1 induces  xxxg775xxx   xxxg776xxx  signaling and apoptosis

since both  xxxg377xxx  and  xxxg775xxx   xxxg776xxx  can be engaged to induce intracellular signaling in nk cells (38, 39), the ability of  xxxd105xxx  to
induce signaling in in vitro il-2-expanded nk cells was evaluated
(fig. 3a). incubation of these nk cells with  xxxd105xxx , but not
ca139 or lt␤r/igg1, increased the levels of p42/44mapk (erk)
phosphorylation approximately 21-fold compared with cells exposed to medium alone (fig. 3a and data not shown). the anticd16 mab also stimulated increased erk activation (⬃18-fold).
in contrast, whereas neither the igg controls ( xxxd2207xxx ,
mopc21, and lt␤r/igg1), the  xxxd2676xxx  mab, nor the anti- xxxg377xxx 
mabs induced activation of erk in these il-2-expanded nk cells,
even though the anti- xxxg377xxx  and  xxxd2676xxx  mabs induced high levels
of erk activation in jurkat cells (see below, fig. 3b). this indicated that coengagement of  xxxg775xxx   xxxg776xxx  and  xxxg377xxx  by  xxxd105xxx  is required to induce nk cell signaling.
to determine whether  xxxd105xxx  is capable of inducing erk
activation when  xxxg377xxx  or  xxxg775xxx   xxxg776xxx  are expressed on the same or apposing cells, jurkat transfectants were employed. as shown in fig.
3b,  xxxd105xxx  induced erk activation in  xxxg377xxx ⫹ xxxg775xxx   xxxg776xxx ⫹ jurkat
transfectants or when  xxxg377xxx ⫹ xxxg775xxx   xxxg776xxx ⫺ and  xxxg377xxx ⫺ xxxg775xxx   xxxg776xxx ⫹ jurkat
transfectants were cocultured. in contrast, erk activation was not
induced when  xxxd105xxx  was incubated with either the
 xxxg377xxx ⫹ xxxg775xxx   xxxg776xxx ⫺ jurkats alone or  xxxg377xxx ⫺ xxxg775xxx   xxxg776xxx ⫹ jurkat transfectants
alone, although these cd3-,  xxxg377xxx -, or  xxxg775xxx   xxxg776xxx -specific mabs did
induce erk activation in the jurkat transfectants expressing the
corresponding cd3,  xxxg377xxx , or  xxxg775xxx   xxxg776xxx  cell surface molecule (fig.
3b). incubation of the  xxxg377xxx ⫹cd3⫹ xxxg775xxx   xxxg776xxx ⫹ jurkat transfectants
with an isotype control fusion protein (lt␤r/igg1) or with
ca139 failed to induce erk phosphorylation (data not shown).
these results showed again that  xxxd105xxx  must bind to both  xxxg377xxx 

and  xxxg775xxx   xxxg776xxx  to induce erk activation consistent with the data generated with the il-2-expanded nk cells (fig. 3a). importantly, the
data demonstrate a functional consequence (erk activation) of
 xxxd105xxx -mediated cognate interactions between  xxxg377xxx  and  xxxg775xxx   xxxg776xxx 
expressed on different cells.
to distinguish whether  xxxd105xxx  induced signaling of jurkat
cells via  xxxg377xxx ,  xxxg775xxx   xxxg776xxx , or both, the same stably transfected
 xxxg377xxx ⫹ xxxg377xxx ⫹ xxxg775xxx   xxxg776xxx ⫺ and  xxxg377xxx ⫺ xxxg377xxx ⫹ xxxg775xxx   xxxg776xxx ⫹ jurkat cells were
transiently transfected with a pnfat-luciferase reporter construct.
the reporter-expressing jurkat transfectants were then cultured either individually or with the reciprocal untransfected cells in the
presence of  xxxd105xxx  or mabs specific for either  xxxg377xxx ,  xxxg775xxx   xxxg776xxx , or
cd3. as shown (fig. 4), when cultured individually in the presence of  xxxd105xxx  or ca139, neither pnfat-luciferase jurkat

 xxxg377xxx -specific mabs activated nfat in these reporter cells. thus,
in this jurkat model system  xxxd105xxx -induced signaling is primarily mediated by the interaction of its fc portion with  xxxg775xxx   xxxg776xxx . although binding of the  xxxg395xxx  portion of  xxxd105xxx  to  xxxg377xxx  alone, as
in the case of ca139, was not capable of inducing nfat activity,
this  xxxg377xxx / xxxg395xxx  interaction was nevertheless required, since incubation with  xxxd105xxx , but not a control human igg1 fusion protein
(lt␤r/igg1), induced nfat activity.
 xxxd105xxx  activation of il-2 expanded nk cells generates a gene

rpas were performed to evaluate whether  xxxd105xxx  was capable
of signaling gene expression in these nk cells and how the expressed patterns compared with those induced by stimulation with
mabs specific for  xxxg377xxx  or  xxxg775xxx   xxxg776xxx . consistent with the cytolytic
functions of nk cells, the il-2-propagated nk cells constitutively
expressed high levels of mrna for  xxxg1008xxx , granzyme b, and
perforin. these were essentially not up-regulated upon stimulation
with  xxxd105xxx  (table iv), except perhaps marginally for granzyme
a mrna. it is possible that the ability of  xxxd105xxx  to up-regulate
these mediators is masked by the propagation of these cells with
il-2, since freshly isolated human nk cells constitutively demonstrate only low expression of granzyme b (and high expression of
granzymes a and m, and perforin) (40). constitutive expression
levels of mrna for other molecules involved in apoptotic pathways, such as granzyme h, granzyme 3, rat ventral prostate (an-

drogen withdrawal apoptosis protein), and various tnf family
death receptors and their ligands (fas,  xxxd3135xxx , tnf-related
apoptosis-inducing ligand, and tnfrp55), were also moderately
high in these il-2-propagated nk cells (table iv), with only a
suggestion of increases in rat ventral prostate mrna levels upon
stimulation with  xxxd105xxx . thus, although spontaneous nk cell
killing of tumor cell lines, and ab-dependent (nk/k) cell-mediated cytolysis are reported to be mediated in part by members of
the tnf receptor subfamily that express intracellular death domains (41– 43), these data do not provide evidence for their role in
the biological activity of  xxxd105xxx . this may reflect the fact that
although these ligands and receptors are expressed on nk cells,
they may not have a major role in the induction of apoptosis of the
nk cells themselves (37, 43– 45), consistent with the observation
(fig. 2a) that concanamycin a almost completely inhibited the nk
cell apoptosis induced by  xxxd105xxx .
the cytokine mrnas evaluated (il-4,  xxxg1180xxx , il-13, il-14,
ifn-␥) were expressed at low or undetectable levels and were
shown to be robustly up-regulated when the nk cells were stimulated with the agonistic  xxxg377xxx -specific mab mitogenic pair (table
iv and fig. 5). in contrast,  xxxd105xxx  and anti- xxxg775xxx   xxxg776xxx  mab failed to
induce the expression of these genes. an apparent slight increase
(3- to 4-fold) in the level of ifn-␥ mrna was observed when the
nk cells were stimulated with  xxxd105xxx , anti- xxxg775xxx   xxxg776xxx , or lt␤r/
igg1, but this effect was slight in comparison with the 23-fold
change in the expression levels induced by the anti- xxxg377xxx  agonist

4470

mab pair. these data indicate again, as noted for cd25 up-regulation (fig. 2b), that these nk cells are not refractory to activation
via  xxxg377xxx , but fail to provide evidence for  xxxd105xxx  recruitment of
 xxxg377xxx -mediated signaling cascades.

discussion
taken together the data presented herein suggest that upon coengagement of  xxxg377xxx  and  xxxg775xxx   xxxg776xxx ,  xxxd105xxx  induces signals in and stimulates  xxxg775xxx   xxxg776xxx ⫹ (e.g., nk) cells to release granzyme b, which, acting in concert with perforin, induces the activation of substrates,
potentially caspases, and consequently apoptosis in ligand-expressing ( xxxg377xxx ⫹) target cells (nk and potentially sensitive t cells).
in the case of  xxxd105xxx -induced nk cell apoptosis, this may be a
fratricidal process similar to that previously reported to be induced
by a  xxxg377xxx -specific mab (46). the patterns of erk activation and
gene induction (the rpa data) observed upon  xxxg377xxx  mab,  xxxg775xxx   xxxg776xxx 
mab, and  xxxd105xxx  induction suggest that in the nk cells employed in the studies herein,  xxxd105xxx  primarily stimulates the
 xxxg775xxx   xxxg776xxx  pathway to generate effector functions. this contrasts with
data showing that both the ag and fc binding domains of herceptin and rituxan engage their molecular receptors (c-erbb2,
cd20, and fc␥r) to induce cellular activation and adcc (4, 10 –
12). this distinction may reflect the fact that abs typically have
100- to 1000-fold higher affinities for their cellular receptors than
does  xxxg395xxx  for  xxxg377xxx . in the case of  xxxd105xxx , the data generated
using the fc␥ isoforms suggest that binding to  xxxg377xxx  may function
primarily to increase  xxxd105xxx ’s avidity for fc␥r on nk cells
and/or macrophages and to target their effector functions to sen-

sitive (apposing)  xxxg377xxx ⫹ (t or nk) cells. this is consistent with
data showing that  xxxg775xxx   xxxg776xxx ⫹ cells are required for  xxxd105xxx  inhibition
of t cell proliferation in mlr (14). these findings are further
substantiated by studies employing a variant of  xxxd105xxx , which
was found to be less active in  xxxg377xxx / xxxg775xxx   xxxg776xxx -mediated bridging assays. administration of this variant was observed to have lower
efficacy in a small clinical trial in psoriasis patients and to have
lesser effects on the peripheral t cell counts of monkeys and humans (biogen, unpublished observations). together these results
suggest that  xxxd105xxx  induces the signaling and activation of the
 xxxg775xxx   xxxg776xxx ⫹ cells and cytolysis of sensitive  xxxg377xxx ⫹ cells in vivo, leading
to the diminution of peripheral t cell counts in rodents and
primates.
as in the case of ab-dependent (nk/k) cell-mediated cytolysis,
our data suggest that the signaling pathways that are activated in
 xxxd105xxx -mediated apoptosis involve the membranolytic agent
perforin (47, 48) and the granzyme serine proteases. these are
released from secretory vesicles in the killer cell cytoplasm into
the target cells (49) where the granzymes access intracellular substrates and initiate a caspase-dependent or independent apoptotic
cascade (48, 50). given the higher levels of surface  xxxg377xxx  expression in preactivated or memory/effector t cells (19) and observations that activated cells are more susceptible to apoptotic pathways (51–53), these cells may be selectively targeted by  xxxd105xxx ,
resulting in the selective decrease in the numbers of memory-effector  xxxg377xxx ⫹ cd45ro⫹ t cells in the blood of psoriatic patients
treated with  xxxd105xxx  in clinical trials (23). it should be considered
that such  xxxd105xxx  activation of fc␥r⫹ effector cells leading to
apoptosis of sensitive  xxxg377xxx ⫹ cells may not be restricted to nk
cells, as macrophages also express  xxxg775xxx   xxxg776xxx  and are implied in the
effect of  xxxd105xxx  in nk cell-depleted human  xxxg377xxx  transgenic mice
(14). additionally, the potential exists for  xxxd105xxx  to mediate effects via other igg1 binding fc␥r, and in this regard  xxxd105xxx  can
induce signaling in  xxxg377xxx ⫹ jurkat cells that have been transfected
with  xxxg770xxx  (data not shown). however, results to date do not provide direct evidence that  xxxg770xxx  influences the biological activity of
 xxxd105xxx .
finally, the definition of the molecular players underlying the
cellular and biochemical mechanism(s) influencing the efficacy
and patient responsiveness to  xxxd105xxx  may contribute to identifying segments of patient populations likely to derive the most
gain from  xxxd105xxx  treatment. the results herein suggest that studies investigating polymorphisms in the molecular targets of  xxxd105xxx  (e.g.,  xxxg377xxx , fc␥r, particularly  xxxg775xxx   xxxg776xxx , and the participants
downstream in its signaling cascade) and their expression in
patients undergoing  xxxd105xxx  treatment may reveal correlations
with therapeutic efficacy, as has recently been shown for rituximab (54).
