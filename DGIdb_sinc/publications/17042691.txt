differential evolution of  xxxg2320xxx  and  xxxd3368xxx 
receptor antibodies in graves’ disease:
 xxxg2320xxx  antibody activity reverts to
pretreatment level after  xxxd435xxx  withdrawal
isabelle guilhem,1 catherine massart,2 jean-yves poirier,1 and didier maugendre1†

in this study, we compared the evolution of  xxxg2320xxx  antibody (tpoab) and thyroid-stimulating antibody (tsab) activities before, during, and after treatment of graves’ disease (gd) with  xxxd435xxx . tpoab
and tsab were measured in sera from 75 patients with gd, during an 18-month block-replace regimen and
after drug withdrawal (12, 24, and 36 months). at diagnosis, tpoab were present in 85% of the patients versus 99% for tsab. during the treatment, tpoab values and prevalence significantly decreased, as observed
with tsab. after drug withdrawal, tpoab levels increased once again to reach the pretreatment values,
whereas tsab remained unchanged. tpoab values and prevalence at drug withdrawal were not significantly
different between patients who remained euthyroid and those who had a relapse of hyperthyroidism. in contrast, tsab values and prevalence were higher at drug withdrawal in relapse patients. in conclusion, tpoab
and tsab changes are similar during gd treatment by  xxxd435xxx  but diverge after drug withdrawal. tpoab
might reflect autoimmune perturbations independently of the clinical status and of the thyroid-stimulating activity.

introduction

subjects and methods

t

subjects

hyrotropin receptor antibodies (tshrab) and thyroid
peroxidase antibodies (tpoab) are among the best-characterized autoantibodies in graves’ disease (gd) (1,2).
tshrab with thyroid-stimulating activity (tsab) are responsible for the hyperthyroidism of gd (2) and is the most
predictive marker that can predict outcome when evaluated
at drug withdrawal (3–7).
since the identification of  xxxg2320xxx  as the microsomal antigen (8,9), few clinical studies have been published on tpoab. it has been shown that during gd there
is a strong autoimmune response against this autoantigen
(10), whereas its significance and the effect of antithyroid
drug (atd) treatment remain unclear.
the aim of this study is to compare the evolution of
tpoab and tsab in patients with gd during an 18-month
treatment by  xxxd435xxx  and a 3-year follow-up after drug
withdrawal.

seventy-five serum samples from patients (15 men and 60
women; mean age of 39 years, range: 19–64 years) with recent
onset of hyperthyroidism due to gd were retrospectively
tested for tpoab and tsab. these patients were recruited in
the department of endocrinology of the rennes university
hospital and enrolled in studies on gd management after giving their informed consent according to protocols approved by
the local ethical committee. all were caucasian and living in
brittany (france). the diagnosis of gd was made on the basis
of the usual clinical signs including hyperthyroidism, homogeneous goiter, and ophthalmopathy in patients who consulted for their first episode of hyperthyroidism. the diagnosis was in all cases confirmed by elevated levels of free t3 and
t4 hormone in serum, suppressed tsh value, and homogeneous and high thyroid 99mtc uptake.

patients were treated for 18 months by a daily high dose
of  xxxd435xxx  (60 mg/day) followed by addition of 25–75
g t3 hormone daily 1 month later to maintain clinical and
biological euthyroidism (11). no patient received thyroid
hormones after  xxxd435xxx  discontinuation. all patients
were examined at diagnosis and at 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 12, and 18
months after the onset of treatment. at each time, thyroid
tests (free t3, free t4 and tsh) were done to adjust the t3
administration. after drug withdrawal, all patients were
seen at 6 months and then were followed up at 12-month intervals for 3 years in case of persistent euthyroidism or until hyperthyroidism recurred. thirty-four patients (45%; 29
females and 5 males) developed a persistent hyperthyroidism after atd withdrawal. thirteen had a relapse of hyperthyroidism within the first year after drug discontinuation, 14 within the second year, and 7 within the third year.
no patient became hypothyroid during the follow-up.
the sera were collected at diagnosis and at 18 months in
all the patients. sera were also available 3, 6, and 12 months
during the atd treatment for 70, 70, and 66 patients, respectively. serum samples were collected 12, 24, and 36
months after drug withdrawal for 68, 58, and 36 patients, respectively. blood samples were collected in anticoagulantfree tubes and centrifuged at 1000g for 10 min at 4°c. sera
were decanted for storage at 40°c until assayed.
laboratory tests
tpoab were measured using a commercial ria kit
(dynotest® anti-tpon, brahms ga, berlin, germany). all
determinations were made in duplicate. the intra-assay and
interassay coefficients of variation were 8.5% at concentrations 60–2000 ku/l. sera were considered positive if the
levels were 60 ku/l.
tsab levels from patient sera were assayed in human thyrocyte cultures according to the method previously described
(12). total camp was measured both in cells and in incubation medium by a radiocompetition method with a kit obtained from amersham (les ulis, france). all tsab determinations were made in triplicate and performed during a 6
month-period. tsab activity was expressed as a percentage
of thyrocyte stimulation during 48-h culture as compared with
the stimulation observed for pooled equal volumes of 30 control sera. values 125% were considered as positive. for mean

tsab concentrations 195% and 489%, the between-run assay
precision determined during a 6 month-period was 9% and
20%, respectively. the within-run assay precision evaluated
for the above tsab levels was 14% and 18%, respectively.
statistical analysis
qualitative variables were compared with the 2 test.
quantitative variables were analyzed using nonparametric
tests. the wilcoxon or mann–whitney tests were used to
compare the time course of variables within groups or the
levels of variables between the different groups, respectively.
correlation analyses were performed using the spearman’s
test. statview version 4.11 (abacus concepts, berkeley, ca)
was used for statistical calculations.
results
evolution of antibodies
the changes in tpoab and tsab were quite similar during the treatment. the prevalence of patients with positive
thyroid antibodies significantly decreased: from 85% (t0) to
47% at the end of treatment (t18) for tpoab (2  25, p 
0.0001) and from 99% to 20% for tsab (2  96, p  0.0001).
the median range of these two parameters significantly decreased during the treatment from 816 to 91 ku/l (z  6.8,
p  0.0001) for tpoab and from 359% to 111% (z  7.2,
p  0.0001) for tsab.
in contrast, the evolutions of tpoab and tsab were different after drug withdrawal. the percentage of tpoab-positive patients significantly increased at 2 years (t24) (68% vs.
47% at t18; 2  5.52, p  0.02). at 3 years, the prevalence of
tpoab was similar to that found at diagnosis (76% vs. 85%,
2  1.45, p  0.23). similarly, tpoab values progressively increased from 91 ku/l (range: 30–8163 ku/l) at t18 to reach
123 ku/l (range: 30–10,000 ku/l; z  3.17, p  0.0015) at
t12, 417 ku/l (range: 30–10,000 ku/l; z  4.48, p  104)
at t24 and 1201 ku/l (range: 30–10,000 ku/l; z  4.01,
p  104) at t36. the values observed at t24 and t36
were similar to those found at diagnosis (p  0.05).
in contrast, the prevalence of tsab-positive patients did
not change after atd withdrawal, and tsab median values
remained below the positivity threshold during the 36month follow-up.

anti-tpo antibody changes in graves’ disease
thyroid antibodies according to the treatment outcome
at diagnosis: neither tpoab nor tsab were predictive of
the outcome.
at the end of treatment: the tpoab prevalence (table 1) and
values (fig. 1a) were not significantly different according to
the outcome. in contrast, the tsab prevalence (table 1) and
values (fig. 1b) at t18 were significantly higher in patients
who developed hyperthyroidism as compared to those who
remained euthyroid.
after drug withdrawal: a similar increase in tpoab val-

1043
ues was observed whatever the outcome (fig. 1a). tsab
values remained higher in patients who became hyperthyroid as compared with patients who remained euthyroid
(fig. 1b).
discussion
our study was carried out to follow the changes in tpoab
during atd treatment as well as during a 3-year follow-up
after the end of treatment. we observed a decrease in tpoab
levels and in tpoab prevalence during atd therapy in

relapse of hyperthyroidism, respectively. the mann–whitney test was used to compare the thyroid antibody levels between
the two groups. no correlation was found between tpoab and tsab at any time of the study (spearman’s test) *p  0.05;

agreement with previous studies (13). more interestingly, we
showed an early and progressively increase in tpoab levels and prevalence during the 3 years after drug withdrawal.
this increase of tpoab activity contrasted with the evolution of tsab median values that remained under the positivity threshold after discontinuation of atd treatment.
these results suggest that the immunosuppressive action of
atd previously reported (14) could induce a shorter effect
on tpoab levels than that caused to tsab.
few works have compared the evolution of these two antibodies during gd. tamaki et al. (15) found that microsomal antibody levels uniformly decreased during pregnancy
and increased after delivery, whereas various patterns of
change were observed in tshrab levels. the authors concluded that immunosuppression during pregnancy might
have a selective influence on the production of different antithyroid antibodies. these data suggest, in agreement with
our results, that different mechanisms may be involved in
the production of tshrab and microsomal/tpo antibodies during gd.
at least two parameters could contribute to the observed
differences between tshrab and tpoab during and after
treatment. first, low levels of tshrab, as detected by immunofluorescence (16) or flow cytometric analysis (17),
could be efficiently downregulated by the immune system
during atd treatment. in contrast, very high levels of
tpoab (10) could resist such a regulation on a long-term basis and revert to baseline levels after drug withdrawal, as
suggested by our data.
second, tshrab affinity and activity could be modified
during the atd treatment. it has been shown that epitopes
for tsab change in half of the patients during gd treatment (18). these changes in tsab epitopes result in the
production of tsab that may be less potent stimulators.
because our study used a functional assay in thyrocyte cultures, the observed evolution in tsab levels could be accounted by for changes in tsab epitopes. the recent development of  xxxg2341xxx  monoclonal antibodies (19–22) may
help to elucidate the complex molecular mechanisms involved in functional interactions between  xxxg2341xxx 
and autoantibodies.
it is well known that tsab causes the hyperthyroidism of
gd (1,2). however, the pathological significance of tpoab
remains unclear. high microsomal antibody levels correlated
with chronic lymphocytic thyroiditis have been reported in
patients who either relapsed (23) or remained in long-term
remission (24). it has been suggested that gd may evolve
gradually into chronic thyroiditis (24). we propose that the
increase of tpoab after the end of treatment might play a
role in such an evolution of the disease.
in conclusion, using a very sensitive tpoab assay, this
study shows that changes in tpoab levels differ from those
in tsab after the end of treatment. an increase in tpoab
levels up to pretreatment values contrasts with tsab titers,
which remain unchanged after drug withdrawal. we suggest that tpoab reflect immune defects independently of
the clinical status and thyroid-stimulating activity.
