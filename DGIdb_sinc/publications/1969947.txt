abstract-the
rise in transmural potential difference (pd) and the fluid secretion induced by 5hydroxytryptamine (5-ht) were measured in rat small intestine in-vivo. both  xxxd1708xxx  and  xxxd2419xxx 
abolished the 5-ht-induced rise in systolic blood pressure mediated by 5-ht2receptors.  xxxd1708xxx  inhibited
the 5-ht-induced increases in the transintestinal pd, but over the same dose range it had no effect on the
fluid secretion induced by 5-ht. in contrast,  xxxd2419xxx  caused a dose-dependent reduction in 5-htinduced fluid secretion at doses that failed to influence the rise in pd. it is concluded that different receptors
are responsible for the effects of 5-ht on fluid secretion and electrical activity in the rat small intestine.

m e ability of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-ht) to influence
transport processes in the small intestine is well-established.
in this tissue 5-ht causes a net secretion of fluid and
electrolytes into the intestinal lumen (kisloff & moore 1976;
mnowitz et a1 1977) and flux determinations have shown
that a decrease in coupled nacl absorption and a stimulation of net ci- secretion could be responsible (donowitz et al
1980; hardcastle et a1 1981). since the ci- secretory
mechanism is electrogenic, 5-ht action is associated with a
rise in the potential difference and short-circuit current
moss the intestinal wall (hardcastle et a1 1981). the nature
of the 5-ht receptors that mediate the stimulation of ci-tion
and inhibition of nacl absorption has not yet been
ckarly established and most studies have used the 5-htrise in transintestinal electrical activity to monitor
the effects of antagonists on 5-ht action on intestinal ion
h s p o r t (cooke & carey 1985; baird & cuthbert 1987;
moriarty et a1 1987; bunce et a1 1988). such methods do not
bwever, detect changes in the activity of electrically neutral
ion transport processes, so in this study the effect of 5-ht
was measured both as a change in electrical activity and a
h u l a t i o n of fluid secretion. the effects of two 5-ht
bntaf30nistson these actions of 5-ht were investigated. both
lanserin (bradley et a1 1986) and  xxxd1708xxx  (schuurkes &
'anheten 1985)have been described as 5-ht2 antagonists,
with  xxxd1708xxx  also exhibiting weak 5-ht3 antagonism
q)unbar et a1 1986; van nueten & schuurkes 1989). in this
3hdy however,  xxxd2419xxx  and  xxxd1708xxx , in spite of their
demonstrating 5-ht2 antagonism, exerted different
*ects on 5-ht-induced changes in fluid movement and
activity in the small intestine.

obtained from the sheffield field laboratories and allowed
free access to food (diet 86, oxoid, london) and water. the
rats were anaesthetized with sodium pentobarbitone (60 mg
kg-i i.p.).
the transintestinal potential difference (pd) was measured in-vivo across a 5 cm segment of mid-intestine. this was
tied off at the distal end and a cannula was inserted into the
proximal end. the loop and the peritoneal cavity were then
filled with 154 mm naci. the pd was measured between two
salt bridge electrodes, one in contact with the luminal fluid
and the other in contact, via a wick electrode, with the fluid in
the peritoneal cavity. these electrodes were connected via
calomel half cells to a vibron electrometer (electronic
instruments ltd., model 33b-2) whose output was displayed
on a vitatron chart recorder (mse scientific instruments,
2001 series). drugs were administered through a cannula in
the jugular vein and each dose was washed in with 0.2 ml
154 mm naci. the electrical response to 5-ht was taken as
the difference between the maximum pd achieved after each
dose of the drug and the value immediately before its
addition. a dose-response curve was constructed for 5-ht
before the administration of an antagonist and was repeated
10 minafter each dose of the blocker.
during these experiments arterial blood pressure was
measured in the left carotid artery via a saline/heparin filled
cannula connected to a pressure transducer (bell & howell)
from which the heart rate was continuously monitored. all
outputs were displayed on a devices mx2 recorder.
control experiments were undertaken which showed that
four consecutive 5-ht dose-response curves, measured over
a period of 180 min, did not differ significantly, validating the
protocol adopted in fig. 2.

the abdomen was opened and a polythene catheter was
placed in the jejunum about 5 cm distal to the flexura
duodenojejunalis and fixed by ligation. a second ligature
was tied approximately 20 cm distally. one h after the
preparation, 2 ml tyrode solution was instilled into the
intestinal loop and the catheter withdrawn before tying off
the proximal end. 5-ht creatinine sulphate (equivalent to
7 x 10-lomol5-htmin-i) orcreatinine sulphate was infused
close intra-arterially into a branch of the superior mesenteric
artery (0.949 ml h- i) using a perfusor (braun-melsungen,
frg). after 30 rnin the loop was removed from the animal
and the volume of fluid it contained determined gravimetrically. the empty loop was weighed and fluid transport was
taken as the difference between the initial and final volumes
in the loop and expressed as pl g- i wet wt/ 30 min. the effect
of 5-ht was calculated by subtracting the mean basal fluid
transport (with creatinine sulphate) from each value
obtained in the presence of 5-ht. when present,  xxxd1708xxx 
and  xxxd2419xxx  were administered s.c. 15 min before filling
the intestinal loop.

results
effects of  xxxd1708xxx  andketanserin on the 5-ht-induced rise in
systolic pressure
rapid intravenous bolus injections of 5-ht elicit changes in
blood pressure that can be classified into three phases, each
associated with activation of a different 5-ht receptor. the
first phase is a rapid, transient fall in blood pressure
accompanied by a decrease in heart rate. this constitutes the
bezold-jarisch effect and results from a reflex stimulation of
the vagus following activation of 5-ht3receptors on sensory
afferent fibres. the second phase is a brief pressor response
associated with the activation of 5-ht2 receptors before the
third phase, mediated via “5-hti-like” receptors, showing a
relatively sustained fall in blood pressure with no accompanying fall in heart rate. these effects are illustrated inset in
fig. 1. 5-ht increased blood pressure in a dose-dependent
manner (fig. i), but this pressor response was effectively
antagonized by prior administration of either  xxxd1708xxx 
(5.2 x
rnol kg-i) or  xxxd2419xxx  (7.6 x lo-* rnol kg-i),
demonstrating effectiveblockade of 5-htz receptors at these
doses.  xxxd1708xxx  will also interact with 5-ht3receptors at the
doses used in this study as is evident from its ability to
antagonize the bezold-jarisch reflex (dunbar et a1 1986).

effects of  xxxd1708xxx  and  xxxd2419xxx  on the 5-ht-induced
increase in the transintestinal pd
the intestinal loop generated a pd of 4-7 mv, serosa
positive and this was increased transiently by 5-ht (fig. 2).
ten rnin after  xxxd1708xxx  administration the basal pd was
not significantly different from its initial value.  xxxd1708xxx 
reduced the pd changes induced by increasing doses of 5-ht
and also suppressed the maximal responses (fig. 2a), effects
that were both dose-dependent. this action of  xxxd1708xxx  does
not appear to represent a non-specific inhibition of secretion
as the rise in pd induced by 1.3 x
rnol kg-l pgez was
rnol kg-i
unaffected (control: 4.8*0.4(6) mv, +2.1 x
 xxxd1708xxx : 4.6+0.3(6) mv, p > 0.05).  xxxd2419xxx  had no
significant effect on the basal pd nor on the changes induced
by 5-ht (fig. 2b). both  xxxd1708xxx  and  xxxd2419xxx , at the
lowest doses tested, blocked the increase in systolic blood
pressure observed in response to 5-ht administration
(fig. 1).
effects of  xxxd1708xxx  and  xxxd2419xxx  on 5-ht-induced puid
secretion
under control conditions there was a net absorption of fluid
of 137f 24(25) pl g-l wet wt/30 min. 5-ht reversed this to a
net secretion of 116f36(22) pl g-l wet wt/30 min
(p<o.ool).  xxxd2419xxx  alone has no effect on basal fluid
movement (beubler et a1 1984, 1989), but in these experiments it reduced the secretory response to 5-ht in a dosedependent manner (fig. 3a). the failure of  xxxd2419xxx  to
influence basal fluid movement or the 5-ht-induced changes
in pd suggests that its inhibition of 5-ht-induced fluid
secretion was not the result of a non-specific action.
 xxxd1708xxx  (2.1 x
rnol kg-i; 8.3 x
mol kg-i) had no
significant effect on basal fluid movement ( p > 0.05 in both
cases). a stimulation of fluid secretion can be demonstrated
using a i5 rnin incubation period, but the transient nature of
this response is evident from the brief rise in short-circuit

qment induced by  xxxd1708xxx  (hardcastle et a1 1984), and this
probably accounts for the failure to detect a significant
-tion
in the 30 min incubation period used in the present
study. the fluid secretion induced by 5-ht (fig. 3b) was not
@wed by  xxxd1708xxx . this lack of effect could not be
to restricted access of  xxxd1708xxx  from its subcutainjection site since its actions in inhibiting the 5-htlndrises in pd were similar when  xxxd1708xxx  was
administered either subcutaneously or intravenously.

‘kebn*rin and  xxxd1708xxx  act as 5-ht receptor antagonists,
both are considered to affect 5-ht2 receptors (bradley et
‘986; schuurkes & van nueten 1985).  xxxd2419xxx  is
%sidered to be particularly useful in characterizing 5-ht2

affinity for the “5-hti-like” receptor (bradley et a1 1986).
 xxxd2419xxx  does however, have some affinity for cr-adrenoceptors but the involvement of such receptors in the actions
of 5-ht reported here can be ruled out. the 5-ht-induced
rise in the transintestinal pd in-vivo is unaffected by the aantagonist phenoxybenzamine (hardcastle et a1 1981) and ctadrenoreceptor stimulation enhances fluid absorption, not
fluid secretion (levens et a1 1979). although  xxxd1708xxx  has
been used as an antagonist for 5-ht2receptors (schuurkes &
van nueten 1985; moriarty et a1 1987) it has been shown to
exhibit weak 5-ht-m receptor antagonism as assessed using
the bezold-jarisch reflex (dunbar et al 1986). the classical
5-ht receptor groups of d and m receptors (gaddum &
picarelli 1957) have been subsumed into the more recent
classification of 5-ht2and 5-ht3, respectively (bradley et a1
1986), although there is now doubt over whether the m
receptor is indeed a 5-ht3receptor (fozard 1987). in spite of
their possible affinity for other receptors, the ability of
 xxxd1708xxx  and  xxxd2419xxx  to antagonize the 5-ht-induced rise
in systolic blood pressure is confirmation of their affinity for
5-ht2receptors (fig. 1). however,  xxxd2419xxx  and  xxxd1708xxx 
acted differently in their ability to block the actions of 5-ht
on fluid transport and the transmural pd in the small
intestine.  xxxd2419xxx  inhibited 5-ht-induced fluid secretion
without affecting the electrical responses to 5-ht (figs 2b,

38

e. beubler et a l

3a), while in contrast,  xxxd1708xxx  had no effect on 5-htinduced fluid secretion but reduced the electrical responses
(figs 2a, 3b). the ability of  xxxd1708xxx  to antagonize the
electrical response to 5-ht (measured as an increase in shortcircuit current) has been noted previously in a variety of
in-vitro preparations including guinea-pig stripped ileum
(cooke & carey 1984), rat stripped ileum (moriarty et a1
1987) and rat stripped descending colon (bunce et a1 1988),
as has the lack of effect of  xxxd2419xxx  on the electrical
responses to 5-ht induced in rat stripped ileum (ball et al
1988), guinea-pig stripped ileum and colon (baird & cuthbert 1987) and rat stripped descending colon (bunce et a1
1988). however, the actions of these agents on 5-ht-induced
fluid secretion has not previously been reported. the present
study indicates that the 5-ht receptors responsible for the
effects of 5-ht on fluid secretion and electrical activity in the
intestine must be of two types-one stimulating electrogenic
c1- secretion and inhibited by  xxxd1708xxx  but not by  xxxd2419xxx , the other inhibiting electroneutral nacl absorption
and antagonized by  xxxd2419xxx  but not by  xxxd1708xxx . by
definition (bradley et a1 1986), the effect on nacl absorption
must be mediated by 5-htz receptors, while that on c1secretion is not. however, the inability of  xxxd1708xxx  to block
5-ht-induced fluid secretion in spite of demonstrating
antagonism against 5-htz-mediated changes in blood pressure raises the possibility of subtypes of 5-ht2 receptors.
another 5-ht2antagonist,  xxxd2637xxx , shares with  xxxd1708xxx 
the ability to inhibit the electrical response to 5-ht (hardcastle et a1 1981). it also reduces nutrient absorption by the
small intestine, an effect that is not observed with either
 xxxd1708xxx  or  xxxd2419xxx  (hardcastle et a1 1986).
the net movement of fluid across the intestine is determined by the net movement of solute. the fluid secretion
induced by 5-ht results from its ability to both inhibit
electroneutral nacl absorption and to stimulate electrogenic
c1- secretion.  xxxd1708xxx  reduced the electrical response to
5-ht, but failed to influence 5-ht-induced fluid secretion. it
would therefore appear to be capable of antagonizing the
actions of 5-ht on the ci- secretory process without altering
its effects on nacl absorption. this is consistent with the
movement of fluid being primarily linked to the cotransport
of naci, since an inhibition of c1- secretion is not reflected
in reduced fluid secretion.  xxxd2419xxx  had contrasting
actions. this agent failed to influence the electrical response
of the intestine to 5-ht, but reversed the 5-ht-induced
inhibition of nacl absorption. under these circumstances
the ci- still secreted in response to 5-ht would be reabsorbed by the nacl cotransport mechanism and so net ion
secretion would not be enhanced, thus accounting for the
inhibition of 5-ht-induced fluid secretion.
although 5-ht influences both nacl absorption and c1secretion, the receptors responsible for these effects appear to
be different. there is still no concensus regarding the location
of these 5-ht receptors that regulate intestinal ion transport.
specific 5-ht binding sites have not been detected on rat
intestinal epithelial cell membranes (gaginella et a1 1983),
although in chicken isolated enterocytes, 5-ht has been
shown to inhibit sodium absorption by releasing endogenous
ca2+ (hirose & chang 1988). tetrodotoxin and atropine
inhibit 5-ht-induced increases in the short-circuit current
across guinea-pig ileum (cooke & carey 1985), suggesting

that 5-ht does not interact with receptors on the enterocyte
but indirectly via a cholinergic mechanism. in contrast,
tetrodotoxin does not affect the action of 5-ht in rat colon
(zimmerman & binder 1984), nor does atropine  xxxd2180xxx &
the 5-ht-induced rise in the pd across rat small intestine
(hardcastle et a1 1981), so further clarification of the site of
the 5-ht receptors is required. 5-ht influences both electro,
genic and electroneutral ion transport mechanisms,
attempts to characterize the 5-ht receptors that regulate
these processes solely by determining the effects of a variety
of 5-ht antagonists on the electrical response to 5-ht which
have concluded that the receptor type cannot be designated
s-ht,-like, 5-ht2 or 5-ht3 (bunce et a1 1988), must be
interpreted with caution because, even if successful, it only
provides information about one aspect of 5-ht action in the
regulation of intestinal ion transport.
