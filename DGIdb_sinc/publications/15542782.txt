specific inhibition of  xxxg411xxx /6 by  xxxd2828xxx  and associated antitumor activity in human tumor xenografts.   xxxd2828xxx  is a highly specific inhibitor of  xxxg411xxx  ( xxxg411xxx ) (ic50, 0.011 micromol/l) and  xxxg414xxx  (ic50, 0.016 micromol/l), having no activity against a panel of 36 additional protein kinases. it is a potent antiproliferative agent against retinoblastoma (rb)-positive tumor cells in vitro, inducing an exclusive g1 arrest, with a concomitant reduction of phospho-ser780/ser795 on the rb protein. oral administration of  xxxd2828xxx  to mice bearing the colo-205 human colon carcinoma produces marked tumor regression. therapeutic doses of  xxxd2828xxx  cause elimination of phospho-rb and the proliferative marker ki-67 in tumor tissue and down-regulation of genes under the transcriptional control of e2f. the results indicate that inhibition of  xxxg411xxx /6 alone is sufficient to cause tumor regression and a net reduction in tumor burden in some tumors.
