toll-like receptors (tlrs) are a family of highly conserved germline-encoded pattern-recognition receptors
(prr), which are utilized by the innate immune system to recognize microbial components, known as
pathogen-associated molecular patterns ( xxxg80xxx ). we cloned and characterized porcine  xxxg2291xxx  and  xxxg2292xxx 
genes from pig lymph node tissue. sequence analysis showed that the aa sequence identities of porcine
 xxxg2291xxx  with human, mouse and bovine  xxxg2291xxx  are 85, 78 and 90%, respectively, whereas porcine  xxxg2292xxx  aa
sequence identities with human, mouse and bovine  xxxg2292xxx  are 73, 69 and 79%, respectively. both porcine
 xxxg2291xxx  and  xxxg2292xxx  proteins were expressed in cell lines and were n-glycosylated. the stimulatory activity
of  xxxg2291xxx  and  xxxg2292xxx  ligands to porcine and human  xxxg2291xxx  and  xxxg2292xxx  in transiently transfected cos-7 and
293t cells were analyzed using a nf-␬b reporter assay. two imidazoquinoline molecules,  xxxd2339xxx  and
gardiquimod, markedly activated both porcine  xxxg2291xxx  and  xxxg2292xxx  whereas only human  xxxg2291xxx , but not  xxxg2292xxx ,
was activated by the ligands. therefore, receptor speciﬁcity for porcine  xxxg2292xxx  is clearly species speciﬁc.
we further showed that porcine  xxxg2291xxx  and  xxxg2292xxx  are located intracellularly and are mainly within the
endoplasmic reticulum. moreover, activation of transfected cells and porcine pbmc by  xxxg2291xxx  ligands was
inhibited by baﬁlomycin a1 indicating the requirement of endosomal/lysosomal acidiﬁcation for activation
of the receptors.

1. introduction
toll-like receptors (tlrs) are a family of highly conserved pattern-recognition receptors (prrs) essential for immune
response. tlrs are utilized by the innate immune system to
recognize microbial components, known as pathogen-associated
molecular pattern (pamps). there is a broad range of pamps from
bacteria, viruses, parasites, fungi and even from host itself, such
as lipoproteins, glycolipids and nucleic acids (akira et al., 2006).
upon engagement with these ligands, tlrs can elicit intracellular cell signaling, leading to cytokine secretion and expression of
co-stimulatory molecules (west et al., 2006).  xxxg2291xxx  and  xxxg2292xxx  are
highly related receptors and are activated by the synthetic antivirus imidazoquinoline molecules,  xxxd2339xxx  ( xxxd2339xxx ), resiquimod
(r-848) (hemmi et al., 2002; jurk et al., 2002), and some guanine

nucleotide analogs (loxoribine) (heil et al., 2003). speciﬁcally, both
 xxxd2339xxx  and resiquimod were identiﬁed as  xxxg2291xxx  ligands because
they failed to induce responses in  xxxg2291xxx  deﬁcient mice but were
able to induce nf-␬b activation in either human or mouse  xxxg2291xxx 
tansfected hek293 cells (gibson et al., 2002; hemmi et al., 2002).
later, resiquimod was reported to also be a ligand of human  xxxg2292xxx 
(jurk et al., 2002). in 2004, three groups independently reported
that uridine-rich or uridine/guanosine-rich single stranded rna
(ssrna) of both viral and host origins were the physiological ligands for mouse  xxxg2291xxx  and human  xxxg2292xxx  (diebold et al., 2004; heil et
al., 2004; lund et al., 2004).
human and mouse  xxxg2291xxx  and  xxxg2292xxx  showed different receptor speciﬁcity to both synthetic and physiological ligands (barton,
2007). for example, neither resiquimod nor ssrna activates mouse
 xxxg2292xxx , which appeared to be nonfunctional, but was recently shown
to be activated by  xxxg2292xxx  ligand when in combination with poly
t odn (gorden et al., 2006). given the species speciﬁc receptor
speciﬁcity of  xxxg2292xxx  exhibited in human and mice, we wondered
whether the receptor speciﬁcity of  xxxg2291xxx  and 8 in other mammals is
also species speciﬁc. we cloned porcine  xxxg2291xxx  and  xxxg2292xxx  genes, and
found that both receptors are activated by a selective  xxxg2291xxx  ligand,
 xxxd2339xxx . we further showed that both receptors are intracellularly localized in er (endoplasmic reticulum) compartment and
require endosomal/lysosomal maturation for their activation.

2. materials and methods
2.1. ligands, cells and tissues
the imidazoquinoline molecules,  xxxd2339xxx  and gardiquimod,
were purchased from invivogen (san diego, ca, usa). the rna orn,
r-1075, which has the sequence: 5 -ccgucuguugugugacu-3
derived from hiv u5 region rna sequence (heil et al., 2004),
was obtained from coley pharmaceutical group (wellesley, ma,
usa). human embryonic kidney (hek) 293t cells and cos-7 cells
(african green monkey sv40-transfected kidney ﬁbroblast cells)
were cultured in dulbecco’s modiﬁed eagle’s medium (dmem)
supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (hyclone) and penicillin/streptomycin. pig mesenteric lymph node and blood were
obtained from pigs (prairie swine center, floral, canada) by dissection and by venipuncture using an 18-gauge needle, respectively.
all experimental protocols were approved by the university of
saskatchewan animal care committee.
2.2. cloning of porcine  xxxg2291xxx  and  xxxg2292xxx  genes
total rna was extracted from pig mesenteric lymph node samples using trizol® reagent (invitrogen). the full-length orf of
porcine  xxxg2291xxx  was cloned using sequence information of the 3 end
of the  xxxg2291xxx  from a porcine est (ncbi accession no. cj015502) and
the 5 end of the porcine  xxxg2291xxx , which was obtained by 5 race using
a 5 race template switching method (matz et al., 1999) with the
primers  xxxg1929xxx  and gsp2 (table 1). the full-length orf was then
pcr ampliﬁed from cdna using the primers ptlr7f and ptlr7r
(table 1) which contained nhei and smai sites for cloning. the complete orf of porcine  xxxg2292xxx  was pcr ampliﬁed from cdna using the
primers ptlr8f and ptlr8r (table 1) which were designed using
the genbank sequence nm 214187 and contained nhei and ecorv
sites for cloning.
both porcine  xxxg2291xxx  and  xxxg2292xxx  pcr products were digested with
the introduced double restriction endonuleases and inserted into
the nhei and ecorv sites of vector pcdna3.1 (invitrogen) modiﬁed
to contain double ha tags which were fused in frame with the c
termini of the inserted genes.
2.3. western blot analysis
cos-7 or 293t cells (2–3 × 105 cells/well in 24-well microtiter
plates) were transfected with 1 ␮g porcine  xxxg2291xxx ,  xxxg2292xxx  or empty
vector pcdna3.1. at 48 h post-transfection, the transfected cells
were lysed in ripa buffer (50 mm tris ph 7.2, 150 mm nacl,
1% sodium  xxxd1835xxx , 0.1% sds, 1% triton x-100) containing
protease inhibitor cocktail (complete, mini, roche). cell lysates
were resolved on 10% sds-polyacrylamide gels in the presence of
 xxxd26xxx . the protein bands on gels were transferred
onto nitrocellulose membranes and incubated with anti-ha mouse
monoclonal antibody (1:200, santa cruz biotechnology). after
washing with tris-buffered saline, the membranes were incubated

3239

with 1:2000-diluted horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat antimouse igg (cell signaling). the bound secondary antibodies were
detected with chemiluminescence substrate (kpl).
for glycosylation analysis, cell lysates were sonicated and
treated with endoglycosidase h (endo h, new england biolabs) and
n-glycosidase f (pngase f, new england biolabs) at 37 ◦ c for 1 h.
the treated cell lysates were applied to sds-polyacrylamide gels
and western blot as above.
2.4. nf-b and type i interferon (ifn) reporter luciferase assay
cos-7 or 293t cells were plated in 96-well microtiter plates
(3–4 × 104 cells/well) 1 day before transfection. the following
amounts of dna per well were transfected by the fugene 6 (roche)
as described (krishnegowda et al., 2005): 10 ng of  xxxg2048xxx  nf-␬b,
pifn␤ or pisre ﬁreﬂy luciferase reporter, 0.2 ng of ␤-actin renilla
luciferase, 2.5 ng of porcine  xxxg2292xxx , human  xxxg2292xxx  or 20 ng of porcine
 xxxg2291xxx , human  xxxg2291xxx  and mouse  xxxg2291xxx  (adjusted for equivalent expression of ha-tagged tlr proteins as judged by western blot). total
dna per well was normalized to 50 ng by adding empty pcdna3.1
vector. twenty-four hours post-transfection, the cells were stimulated with medium or ligands for 6–10 h, and then the cells were
washed once in pbs and lysed in passive lysis buffer (promega). the
luciferase activity was measured using the dual luciferase reporter
assay system (promega). the relative light units were quantitated
using the formula (light output by nf-␬b or type i ifn promoter ﬁreﬂy luciferase)/(light output by ␤-actin-renilla luciferase control).
the stimulatory activity was expressed as the fold nf-␬b or type i
ifn promoter activation by ligands relative to that by medium.
2.5. microscopy
about 4 × 104 cells were plated in 8-well chamber slides 1 day
before and transfected with 250 ng porcine  xxxg2291xxx  and  xxxg2292xxx , respectively. forty-eight hours post-transfection, cells were ﬁxed in a
mixture of acetone and methanol (1:1) for 15 min at −20 ◦ c. after
rehydration with pbs, cells were incubated with anti-ha mouse
monoclonal antibody (1:200, santa cruz biotechnology) or antihuman  xxxg2292xxx  rabbit polyclonal antibody (1:200, d-15 santa cruz
biotechnology) for 1 h at room temperature. cells were rinsed two
times in pbs and incubated with secondary antibody, alexa fluor
594 conjugated anti-mouse igg (1:1000, molecular probes) or alexa
fluor 488 conjugated anti-rabbit igg (1:1000, molecular probes),
for another 1h at room temperature. finally, the cells were counter
stained by dapi (4 , 6-diamidino-2-6 phenylindole) with prolong
gold dapi (molecular probes). images were obtained on a carl
zeiss axiovert 200m inverted ﬂuorescent microscope. for confocal
microscopy, the transfected cells were stained with anti-ha rabbit polyclonal antibody (1:200, santa cruz biotechnology) together
with anit- xxxg334xxx  (1:200 bd pharmingen), anti- xxxg1915xxx  (1:200 bd
pharmingen) or anti- xxxg1300xxx  (also known as anti- xxxg1300xxx , 1:200 bd
pharmingen) mouse monoclonal antibody. cells were then stained
with a mixture of the above two secondary antibodies. finally, the

fig. 1. phylogram tree of  xxxg2291xxx ,  xxxg2292xxx  and  xxxg2293xxx  across pig, cattle, human and mouse
species. the picture was generated through multi-alignment using clustalw based
on the protein sequences retrieved from genbank database. the accession no. for
each protein is indicated. btlr, bovine tlr; htlr, human tlr; mtlr, mouse tlr.

cells were mounted with prolong gold mounting medium and analyzed using a confocal microscope zeiss lsm410 equipped with
external argon ion laser.

and bovine  xxxg2292xxx  are 73, 69 and 79%, respectively. as domestic animals, pig and cattle shared a higher similarity for  xxxg2291xxx  and  xxxg2292xxx 
with each other than the rest across the species mentioned above
(fig. 1).
the expression of ptlr7 and ptlr8 were examined in mammalian cos-7 cells and 293t cells. both ptlr7 and ptlr8 were
expressed as ∼160 kda proteins with the former one a little bit
smaller in molecular weight (fig. 2a and b). in contrast, the length
of ptlr7 and ptlr8 are 1050 and 1028 aa, respectively and the
expected molecular weights are about 116 and 113 kda accordingly.
the discrepancy suggested that both proteins are n-glycolsylated
which is common in tlr family members and that ptlr8 is more
heavily glycosylated than ptlr7. indeed, electrophoretic mobility
of ptlr8 was sensitive to glycosidase endo h and pngase f treatment; after removal of glycosylation by both glycosidases, ptlr8
appeared as ∼120 kda bands consistent with that deduced from
its aa sequence (fig. 2c). due to much lower expression level of
ptlr7, we could not test the sensitivity of ptlr7 to glycosidase. in
addition to existence as monomer forms, both proteins also form
dimer/oligomers (>250 kda bands; fig. 2a–c) which are thought as
necessary for tlr signaling transduction (gay et al., 2006).

2.6. porcine pbmc stimulation and baﬁlomycin a1 inhibition
3.2. the activation of porcine  xxxg2291xxx  and  xxxg2292xxx 
the pbmcs were isolated from blood of 8-week-old pigs by
density gradient centrifugation as previously described (dar et
al., 2008) with minor modiﬁcation. brieﬂy, buffy coat was collected from blood after centrifugation at 1400 g for 30 min. cell
suspension was overlaid to  xxxd3253xxx -paque plustm (ge healthcare) and
centrifuged at 2000 × g for 45 min. puriﬁed pbmcs were washed
three times, counted, resuspended in aim-v (gibco-brl) supplemented with 2% fetal bovine serum, and plated in 96-well plate at
a cell density of 5 × 105 cells/well. the cells were pretreated with
the baﬁlomycin a1 for 2 h, washed and stimulated with  xxxd2339xxx 
or lps for 48 h. supernatant from cell cultures were harvested and
il-12 production was measured by elisa as previously described
(dar et al., 2008).
3. results
3.1. sequence analysis and expression of porcine  xxxg2291xxx  and  xxxg2292xxx 
the full-length coding sequences of porcine  xxxg2291xxx  and  xxxg2292xxx 
(also designated as ptlr7 and ptlr8 hereafter) genes we cloned
were submitted to genbank database under the ncbi accession nos. ef583901 and ef583903, respectively. the coding aa
sequences of ptlr7 and ptlr8 were compared by clustalw
(http://ca.expasy.org) with other  xxxg2291xxx  and 8 across human, mouse
and cattle species. as shown in fig. 1, the aa sequence similarity of ptlr7 with human, mouse and bovine  xxxg2291xxx  are 85, 78 and
90%, respectively, whereas ptlr8 similarity with human, mouse

upon ligand engagement tlr proteins trigger downstream cellular signaling, leading to the activation of nf-␬b and mapks
including p38 and jnk mapk (west et al., 2006). we used the nf␬b reporter assay to measure the activation of ptlr7 and ptlr8
by the  xxxg2291xxx  and 8 ligands:  xxxd2339xxx , gardiquimod and orn (r1075). as shown in fig. 3a and b, both ptlr7 and ptlr8 were
activated by  xxxd2339xxx  and gardiquimod but not orn. speciﬁcally,
in both transfected cos-7 cells and 293t cells, the ptlr7 was comparably activated by  xxxd2339xxx  and gardiquimod, whereas ptlr8
was preferentially activated by  xxxd2339xxx  and this preference was
more pronounced in transfected 293t cells. in contrast, human
 xxxg2292xxx  was recognized only by orn as previously reported, whereas
human  xxxg2291xxx  and mouse  xxxg2291xxx  were activated by both  xxxg2291xxx  ligands
 xxxd2339xxx  and gardiquimod as expected. cells transfected with
only nf-␬b reporter, as a control, did not respond to any tlr ligand stimulation suggesting that the activation by tlr ligands was
receptor speciﬁc. pma (sigma), as a ligand control, which activates
nf-␬b independent of tlr pathway, activated nf-␬b in all transfected cells.
human and mouse  xxxg2291xxx ,  xxxg2292xxx ,  xxxg2293xxx  also elicit type i interferon
induction, especially ifn-␣ (kawai and akira, 2006). we examined
the type i ifn induction by stimulation of ptlr7 and ptlr8 transfected cells co-transfected with type i ifn reporter plasmid pifn␤
(matsumoto et al., 2002) or pisre (stratagene). however, no obvious induction of type i ifn was observed for either transfected cos-7
cells (left panel, fig. 3c) or 293t cells (not shown). to ensure that the

3.3. subcellular localization of porcine  xxxg2291xxx  and  xxxg2292xxx 
among the human and mouse tlr family,  xxxg2289xxx ,  xxxg2291xxx ,  xxxg2292xxx , and
 xxxg2293xxx  are localized inside cells, while others are expressed on the cell
surface (akira et al., 2006). using ﬂuorescence microscopy, we conﬁrmed the intracellular localization of ptlr7 and ptlr8 by virtue
of the carboxyl ha tag which was recognized by anti-ha antibody
(left and middle panels, fig. 4a). porcine  xxxg2292xxx  was also recognized
by commercial anti-human  xxxg2292xxx  antibody by immunoﬂuorescence
(right panel, fig. 4a), but ptlr7 could not be detected by commercial anti- xxxg2291xxx  antibodies in either immunoﬂuorescence or western
blot experiments.
we extended the study by examining the subcellular localization of ptlr7 and ptlr8 using confocal ﬂuorescence microscopy.
the ptlr7 and ptlr8 were analyzed for co-localization with er,
early endosomal and late endosomal/lysosomal resident proteins
which were labeled with anti- xxxg334xxx  (barton et al., 2006), antirab5 (funami et al., 2004), and anti- xxxg1300xxx  (clemens et al., 2004)
antibody, respectively. as shown in fig. 4b and c, both ptlr7 and
ptlr8 were co-localized with er resident protein, which was also
indicated by the sensitivity of the ptlr8 to endoglycosidase h treatment (fig. 2c). additionally, both proteins were also co-localized, to
a lower extent, with the early endosomal resident protein, but no
co-localization was observed with the late endosomal/lysosomal
resident protein.
3.4. the activation of porcine  xxxg2291xxx  and  xxxg2292xxx  are baﬁlomycin a1
sensitive
next we tested the effect on cellular signaling of baﬁlomycin
a1 , an inhibitor of v-type h+ -atpase that is required for acidiﬁcation of golgi, late endosome, and lysosome (yoshimori et al.,
1991). in ptlr7 and ptlr8 transfected cells, we used 25, 50,
100 nm baﬁlomycin a1 to pretreat the cells before stimulation with
 xxxd2339xxx  or gardiquimod. baﬁlomycin inhibited both  xxxd2339xxx 
and gardiquimod induced nf-␬b activation in a dose dependent
manner in transfected cos-7 cells (fig. 5a) and in 293t cells (not
shown).
the effect of baﬁlomycin a1 on  xxxd2339xxx  and lps induced il12 production in porcine pbmcs was also investigated (fig. 5b).
stimulation of il-12 production with  xxxd2339xxx  was inhibited by
baﬁlomycin in a dose dependent manner. however, baﬁlomycin had
no effect on lps stimulated il-12 production, which is activated
via the cell surface expressed tlr4 receptor. thus, the stimulation
of ptlr7 and ptlr8 by  xxxd2339xxx  requires endosomal/lysosomal
acidiﬁcation, which is consistent with results observed for the activation of tlr 3,  xxxg2291xxx ,  xxxg2292xxx  and  xxxg2293xxx  of human and mouse species

was transfected into cos-7 cells (a) and 293t cells (b). twenty-four hours later, the
transfected cells were stimulated with 10 ␮g/ml  xxxd2339xxx , 5 ␮g/ml gardiquimod,
10 ␮g/ml orn r-1075 complexed with dotap or 100 ng/ml pma for another 8 h.
(c) cos-7 cells transfected with pifn␤ ﬁreﬂy luciferase reporter or pisre ﬁreﬂy
luciferase reporter together with ptlr7 or ptlr8 were stimulated with 10 ␮g/ml
imquimod or 5 ␮g/ml gardiquimod for 8 h (left panel). cos-7 cells transfected with
only pifn␤ reporter or pisre reporter were stimulated with 10 ␮g/ml poly(i·c) to
measure endogenous  xxxg2289xxx  mediated type i ifn production (right panel). all experiments were performed three times with similar results. the error bars indicate range
between duplicate samples. htlr, human tlr; mtlr, mouse tlr; nf-␬b, reporter

type i ifn production machinery exists in these cells, reporter gene
transfected cos-7 cells were stimulated with poly(i·c) and the promoter activation occurred, which is mediated through endogenous
 xxxg2289xxx  in cos-7 cells (right panel, fig. 3c).

4. discussion
our investigation reveals for the ﬁrst time that ptlr8 is
recognized and activated by known  xxxg2291xxx  ligands especially by
 xxxd2339xxx .  xxxd2339xxx  ( xxxd2339xxx ), an imidazoquinoline, has been
widely considered as an agonist speciﬁc to  xxxg2291xxx  because it has no
immunostimulatory activity in  xxxg2291xxx  knockout mice and induces
nf-␬b activation in either human or mouse  xxxg2291xxx  but not human
 xxxg2292xxx  tansfected hek293 cells (gibson et al., 2002; hemmi et al.,
2002; jurk et al., 2002; philbin and levy, 2007). small molecular
imidazoquinolines were synthesized and from them  xxxg2291xxx ,  xxxg2292xxx ,
and  xxxg2291xxx /8 selective ligands were screened and used to reveal functional differences between human  xxxg2291xxx  and  xxxg2292xxx . among these
selective ligands,  xxxd2339xxx  was used successfully as a selective
 xxxg2291xxx  ligand (gorden et al., 2005). previously, it had been suggested that mouse  xxxg2292xxx  was non-functional. however, later studies

demonstrated that mouse  xxxg2292xxx  was responsive to human  xxxg2292xxx  ligands but only in the presence of  xxxd3365xxx  odn. moreover, mouse
 xxxg2292xxx  was not responsive to the human and murine  xxxg2291xxx  ligand
 xxxd2339xxx  (gorden et al., 2006) which further strengthened the
notion that  xxxd2339xxx  is a strict  xxxg2291xxx  ligand. our result that
 xxxd2339xxx  activates ptlr8 is adding a layer of complexity to the
previous thoughts. we also cloned  xxxg2291xxx  and  xxxg2292xxx  genes from cattle
(genbank database accession nos. ef583900 and ef583902) and
analyzed their receptor speciﬁcity. bovine receptors had similar
ligand recognition patterns as porcine  xxxg2291xxx  and  xxxg2292xxx  (data not
shown). this similarity may reﬂect a common feature between
domestic animals, which is also indicated by their higher  xxxg2291xxx /8/9
sequence similarity between pig and cattle (fig. 1).
in this study, neither ptlr7 nor ptlr8 conferred responsiveness to orn, although we tested different concentrations of orn
r-1075 and other stimulatory orn sequences. however, orn r1075 is known to stimulate porcine pbmcs and such activation can
be inhibited by baﬁlomycin a1 (unpublished data). it is very possible that as in the case of mouse  xxxg2291xxx  (heil et al., 2004), which was
responsible for orn activation based on the results from knockout

mice but failed to respond to orn in transfected cells, there is some
limitation for ptlr7 and/or ptlr8 reconstitution in ﬁbroblasts such
as hek293t and cos-7 cells. alternatively, ptlr7 and/or ptlr8 may
optimally function in certain cell types, such as plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pdc).
like human  xxxg2292xxx  (gibbard et al., 2006) and human  xxxg2293xxx  (latz
et al., 2004), ptlr7 and ptlr8 are localized mainly in the cellular
er compartment. it was also validated by the complete sensitivity
of ptlr8 to endo h, a common property of er resident proteins. in
the case of human  xxxg2293xxx  (latz et al., 2004), stimulation of dendritic
cells and macrophages with cpg dna results in  xxxg2293xxx  redistributing from er to lysosome, which is acidiﬁed by v-type h+ -atpases
and therefore, the  xxxg2293xxx  activation will be abolished by baﬁlomycin
a1 . however, as with human  xxxg2292xxx  (gibbard et al., 2006), we did not
ﬁnd the alteration of ptlr7 and ptlr8 subcellular localization upon
imidazoquinoline stimulation (not shown). we also show here that
both ptlr7 and ptlr8 are co-localized, to some degree, with early
endosomal but not late endosomal/lysosomal resident protein. er
and early endosome are not acidiﬁed by v-type h+ -atpase; therefore, like human  xxxg2292xxx  (gibbard et al., 2006), there should be some

cells transfected with nf-␬b ﬁreﬂy luciferase reporter together with ptlr7 or
ptlr8 were treated with 25, 50 or 100 nm baﬁlomycin a1 for 1 h at 24 h posttransfection. cells were then separated from baﬁlomycin solutions and stimulated
with 10 ␮g/ml  xxxd2339xxx  or 5 ␮g/ml gardiquimod for another 8 h. data shown

the indicated concentrations for 2 h and stimulated with 10 ␮g/ml  xxxd2339xxx  or
100 ng/ml lps for 48 h. il-12 amount in supernatant was measured by elisa. data

mechanism of delivery for a small fraction of ptlr7 and ptlr8 to be
trafﬁcked into the acidiﬁed compartment such as late endosome or
lysosome because the activation of ptlr7 and ptlr8 were inhibited
by baﬁlomycin a1 .
in summary, our results provide new insights into receptor
speciﬁcity for mammalian  xxxg2292xxx  and may be valuable in the rational use of  xxxg2291xxx /8 ligands in immunotherapy and vaccination of
mammalian species.
