site selectivity of competitive antagonists for the mouse adult  xxxg452xxx .  the muscle-type  xxxg456xxx  has two nonidentical binding sites for ligands. the selectivity of acetylcholine and the competitive antagonists (+)- xxxd3456xxx  and  xxxd2625xxx  for adult mouse receptors is known. here, we examine the site selectivity for four other competitive antagonists: cisatracurium, pancuronium, vecuronium, and rocuronium. we rapidly applied acetylcholine to outside-out patches from transfected bosc23 cells and measured macroscopic currents. we have reported the ic(50) of the antagonists individually in prior publications. here, we determined inhibition by pairs of competitive antagonists. at least one antagonist was present at a concentration producing > or =67% receptor inhibition.  xxxd2625xxx  shifted the apparent ic(50) of (+)- xxxd3456xxx  in quantitative agreement with complete competitive antagonism. the same was observed for pancuronium competing with vecuronium. however, pancuronium and vecuronium each shifted the apparent ic(50) of (+)- xxxd3456xxx  less than expected for complete competition but more than expected for independent binding. the situation was similar for cisatracurium and (+)- xxxd3456xxx  or  xxxd2625xxx . cisatracurium did not shift the apparent ic(50) of pancuronium or vecuronium, indicating independent binding of these two pairs. the data were fit to a two-site, two-antagonist model to determine the antagonist binding constants for each site, l(alphaepsilon) and l(alphadelta). we found l(alphaepsilon)/l(alphadelta) = 0.22 (range, 0.14-0.34), 20 (9-29), 21 (4-36), and 1.5 (0.3-2.9) for cisatracurium, pancuronium, vecuronium, and rocuronium, respectively. the wide range of l(alphaepsilon)/l(alphadelta) for some antagonists may reflect experimental uncertainties in the low affinity site, relatively poor selectivity (rocuronium), or possibly that the binding of an antagonist at one site affects the affinity of the second site.
