1 two types of ca2+ channel a1-subunits were co-expressed in xenopus oocytes with the ca2+ channel
a2- and b1-subunits. the ba2+ current through the a1ca2b and the a1ba2b channels had
electrophysiological and pharmacological properties of l- and n-type ca2+ channels, respectively.
2 amlodipine had a strong blocking action on both the l-type and n-type ca2+ channels expressed in
the oocyte. the potency of the amlodipine block on the  xxxg303xxx  was comparable to that on
the l-type ca2+ channel. at 7100 mv holding potential, the ic50 values for amlodipine block on the
l-type and  xxxg303xxx  were 2.4 and 5.8 mm, respectively.
3 the blocking action of amlodipine on the  xxxg303xxx  was dependent on holding potential
and extracellular ph, as has been observed with amlodipine block on the l-type ca2+ channel. a
depolarized holding potential and high ph enhanced the blocking action of amlodipine,
4 the time course of block development by amlodipine was similar for l-type and n-type ca2+
channels. however, it was slower than the time course of block development by nifedipine for the l-type
ca2+ channel.

introduction

methods

the dihydropyridines (dhps) are a group of ca2+ channel
blocking agents that are used for the treatment of hypertension. the therapeutic role of ca2+ channel blockers arises from
their ability to lower blood pressure by relaxing the arteriolar
smooth muscle and decreasing the peripheral vascular resistance.
a common side eect of dhps is moderate re¯ex tachycardia mediated by the sympathetic system.
amlodipine is a dihydropyridine compound characterized
by a low incidence of tachycardia (lopez et al., 1990), which is
consistent with ®ndings that the ability of amlodipine to stimulate the sympathetic system is very weak compared to other
members of the dhp family (kaplan, 1991; leenen & fourney, 1996). so far, the unique action of the drug has been
explained by its extremely slow pharmacokinetic properties
(burges et al., 1989). however, some studies have suggested
that amlodipine may have modulating eects on the neurohormonal system (donati et al., 1992; leenen & fourney,
1996).
although it is generally accepted that the dhps are
speci®c blockers of the l-type ca2+ channels, we hypothesized that amlodipine may also act on n-type ca2+ channels. the activity of the n-type ca2+ channels in nerve and
secretory cells is linked to both sympathetic nerve tone and
catecholamine release. the eect of amlodipine on the
sympathetic and neurohormonal system may be explained by
interaction with the  xxxg303xxx . to test this hypothesis, we compared the blocking eect of amlodipine and
nifedipine on cloned l-type and n-type ca2+ channels expressed in xenopus oocytes. our results clearly show that
amlodipine has a strong blocking action on both the n-type
and l-type ca2+ channels.

the plasmid containing the a1b calcium channel cdna
(pkcrb3) has been described previously (fujita et al., 1993).
the 7.3 kb hindiii/hindiii fragment from pkcrb3 was ligated with the hindiii-cleaved psp64as to yield pspb3. the
6.8 kb hindiii/hindiii fragment containing the entire coding
region of the a1c ca2+ channel (mikami et al., 1989) was inserted into the hindiii site of the pspa2 vector (nakamura et
al., 1991), to yield pspcdr. the psp65 or psp72 recombinant
plasmids carrying the a2- or b1a-ca2+ channel subunit cdnas
have been described previously (mikami et al., 1989; mori et
al., 1991). crnas speci®c for the a1b, a1c, a2 and b1a ca2+
channel subunit were synthesized in vitro by use of the
megascript sp6 kit (ambion).
xenopus oocytes were injected either with 0.3 mg ml71 a1b or
a1c crna in combination with 0.2 mg ml71 a2 crna and
0.1 mg ml71b1a crna. the injected oocytes were incubated for
2 to 5 days and then were subjected to electrophysiological
measurements at 21+28c (takao et al., 1994). oocytes were
bathed in a chamber perfused with an extracellular solution
containing (mm): ba2+ 10, tma-oh 50, k+2, hepes 5 and
ni¯umic acid 0.3 (ph 7.5 with methanesulphonic acid), and iba
¯owing through the ca2+ channels was measured by a twomicroelectrode voltage-clamp method by a geneclamp 500
ampli®er (axon instruments, foster city, ca, u.s.a.). the
experimental chamber was 0.5 ml in volume and was perfused
continuously (2.0 to 3.0 ml min71) with the extracellular solution. commercial software (pclamp version 6.0, axon instruments) was used for generating voltage pulses, acquiring
data and analysing the currents. typically, the ooctyes were
clamped at 7100 or 780 mv, and depolarized +10 mv every
15 s. microelectrodes were ®lled with 3m kcl, and those
showing a resistance of 0.5 ± 1.2 om were used.
statistical data are presented as the mean+s.e.mean. fits of
experimental data to mathematical equations were performed
by use of a non-linear least squares ®tting algorithm. amlodipine was a generous gift from sumitomo pharmaceuticals
co., ltd. (tokyo, japan). all other drugs were purchased from
sigma (u.s.a.).

figure 1a illustrates inward ba2+ currents (iba) recorded from
xenopus ooctyes that had been injected with a1c (upper panel)
or a1b (lower panel) crna in combination with crnas of the
a2-subunit (mikami et al., 1989) and the b1a-subunit (mori et
al., 1991) of the ca2+ channel. a step depolarization from a
holding potential of 780 mv to 10 mv produced inward
current in ooctyes injected with either a1b or a1c subunit
crna. mean peak inward current through the expressed ltype ca2+ channels (a1ca2b) and n-type ca2+ channels
(a1ba2b) was 1.34+0.5 ma (n=23) and 1.62+0.4 ma (n=48),
respectively. in the control study, we observed that the ba2+
current (iba) through both the l-type (n=10) and n-type
(n=8) ca2+ channels was stable over 30 min. each type of
current was completely blocked by its speci®c pharmacological
antagonist as shown in figure 1a (mikami et al., 1989; ellinor
et al., 1995). thus, the expressed channel subunits had typical
pharmacological characteristics for l- and n-type ca2+
channels. the xenopus oocytes have an endogenous ca2+
channel and this endogenous ca2+ channel is insensitive to
both dihydropyridines and o-conotoxin (bouron et al., 1995).
iba through the endogenous ca2+ channels had a maximal
inward current amplitude of 762.0+11.3 na (n=10) at
around +20 mv, under our experimental conditions in the
oocytes injected only with crnas of the a2- and b1a-subunit.
the fraction of iba through the endogenous ca2+ channels is
considered to be less than 5% of the total current amplitude.
therefore, contamination of the endogenous ca2+ channel
was considered to be negligible when the eect of a drug on
expressed ca2+ channel was measured. the right lower panel
of figure 1a shows the eect of nifedipine on n-type ca2+
channels (a1ba2b). nifedipine had little eect on the channel at
a concentration of 10 mm.
figure 1b shows a representative trace illustrating the eect
of amlodipine on iba through an  xxxg303xxx . amlodipine blocked the iba in a dose-dependent manner. when
the membrane potential was depolarized to +10 mv from a
holding potential of 7100 mv, maximal peak inward current
was 1.42 ma in the control. when amlodipine was added to the
extracellular solution, the iba decreased gradually. a steady
state inhibition was obtained within about 5 min after beginning of amlodipine superfusion. iba was decreased to 0.98 ma
by 1 mm amlodipine. the amlodipine concentration was then
increased to 10 mm and the iba was observed for another 5 min.
the current was further decreased to 0.43 ma. as shown in
figure 1c, amlodipine did not aect the threshold of iba or the
membrane potential at which the maximal peak inward current
was obtained.
to evaluate the blocking potency of amlodipine, we compared the dose-dependent eect of amlodipine and nifedipine
on an  xxxg303xxx . the eect of each drug was
evaluated at 5 min after beginning the superfusion. similar
experiments were repeated to evaluate the actions of both
drugs on the l-type ca2+ channel. dose-response curves for
the eect of amlodipine and nifedipine on the l-type and ntype ca2+ channel are shown in figure 2a. both drugs blocked
the l-type ca2+ channel. however, under our experimental
conditions, the drug concentration for 50% blockage of the
current amplitude (ic50) was about 10 times higher for amlodipine. amlodipine blocked the  xxxg303xxx  in a
dose-dependent manner. the ic50 for amlodipine block on the
 xxxg303xxx  was 5.8 mm. the hill coecient for drug
binding was 0.92, which suggests 1 : 1 binding of the drug to
the channel (n=12). as previously shown (tsien et al., 1991),
nifedipine had virtually no eect on the  xxxg303xxx .
the time course of block development for each drug at
10 mm was compared at a holding potential of 7100 mv.
when the change in current amplitude was described by a
single exponential process, the time constant of block development by amlodipine was 75.1+10.2 s for l-type ca2+
channels (n=8) and 93.8+7.4 s for n-type ca2+ channels
(n=6), respectively. the time constant of block development

of the ba2+ current (iba) are shown in the control and after 5 min of
superfusion with the ca2+ channel blockers. iba was elicited by a
step depolarization to +10 mv from a holding potential of 780 mv.
the peak iba amplitude in the oocyte expressing a1ca2b (l-type)
channel was 1.68 ma in the control, and was reduced to 0.11 ma by
nifedipine 10 mm (upper panel). iba in an oocyte expressing a1ba2b
(n-type) channel (lower panel left) was 1.27 ma. the current was
almost completely blocked by 1 mm o-conotoxin. on the other hand,
iba through the  xxxg303xxx  was insensitive to nifedipine
10 mm (lower right panel). nifedipine  xxxd1891xxx  mm had virtually no eect

by nifedipine for l-type ca2+ channels was 12.5+5.2 s (n=8),
which was signi®cantly smaller than the time constant for
amlodipine block of the l-type ca2+ channels (p50.01). after
washout of amlodipine the iba through the n-type ca2+
channels partially recovered. in 5 experiments, the iba recovered to 82.5+8.2% of control values with 5 min washouts.
the eect of amlodipine on the l-type ca2+ channel is
known to be dependent on holding potential and extracellular
ph. therefore, we evaluated whether the eect of amlodipine
on the  xxxg303xxx  was dependent on these para-

channel at two dierent holding potentials (7100 mv and

are shown. the block of iba by 1 mm amlodipine was more
prominent at a depolarized holding potential and high ph,
similar to the eect of amlodipine of l-type ca2+ channel
(kass & arena, 1989). to con®rm the eect of the holding
potential and ph, we measured the dose-dependent eect of
amlodipine. as clearly shown in figure 2c, the blocking eect
of amlodipine was enhanced by a depolarized holding poten-

tial and high extracellular ph. the eect of these two parameters on the dose-response curve was additive. the ic50 decreased to 0.08 mm when the holding potential was 780 mv
and the extracellular ph was 10.5. the voltage and ph dependent block by amlodipine of the n-type ca2+ channels is
similar to the block of l-type ca2+ channels by this drug (kass
& arena, 1989).

discussion
in the xenopus oocytes expression system, we discovered that
amlodipine blocks n- and l-type ca2+ channels with a comparable potency. this ®nding was quite unexpected, as dhp
compounds are generally recognized as speci®c l-type ca2+
channel blockers. our results demonstrate the need to evaluate
the ca2+ channel subtype selectivity of each individual dhp
compound.
recent studies indenti®ed the speci®c binding site of the
dhp compounds within the l-type ca2+ channel by making
chimeric channels constructed from dhp sensitive and nonsensitive channels (grabner et al., 1996), and by site directed
mutagenesis (peterson et al., 1996). determining the binding
site of amlodipine within the  xxxg303xxx  may provide insight into the subtype dierences seen between the interaction of amlodipine with the two types of ca2+ channels.
our results showed that block of the n-type ca2+ channels
by amlodipine was dependent on both membrane potential
and extracellular ph. previous studies have extensively investigated the voltage and ph dependent block of amlodipine on
the l-type ca2+ channel. the voltage-dependence was explained by state-dependent changes in the drug anity due to
alterations in the channel conformation (kass & arena, 1989).
the ph dependence was attributed to the transition between
the molecular and ionized forms of the drug (nayler & gu,
1991). the membrane potential and extracellular ph dependent block by amlodipine of the n-type ca2+ channels may be
controlled by similar mechanisms as those suggested for the ltype ca2+ channels. to determine this detailed channel kinetic
studies need to be performed.
the xenopus oocyte expression system allowed us to compare the eects of amlodipine on n-type and l-type ca2+
channels under identical experimental conditions. we found

block of n-type ca2+ channels by amlodipine

1139

that, at a 7100 mv holding potential with ph 7.5, 10 mm
amlodipine blocked both the l-type and  xxxg303xxx 
with a time constant of block development around 1 min.
therefore, we demonstrated that the blocking potency of
amlodipine on the expressed l- and n-type ca2+ channels
were comparable. however, the steady state block of amlodipine on the ca2+ channels might not be evaluated well by this
system. the development of block by amlodipine is known to
be very slow at physiological ph, at which more than 90% of
this compound is ionized (mason et al., 1989). the development of block is known to be even slower at lower concentrations of the drug (burges et al., 1989; kass & arena, 1989).
in a binding assay on rat cardiac membrane, nayler & gu
(1991) showed that amlodipine required several hours to reach
steady state block. such a long time span was not examined in
the two microelectrode voltage clamp method with xenopus
oocytes, and we did not study the very slow component of
block development. the steady state block of amlodipine on
 xxxg303xxx  needs to be revealed by further studies.
several ®ndings have suggested that amlodipine may aect
the neurohormonal system by modulating the pressor response
(donati et al., 1992) and plasma catecholamine levels (abernethy et al., 1988; leenen & fourney, 1996; lopez et al., 1990).
some of these studies have shown the sympatholytic eect of
amlodipine, which is exceptional for a dhp compound. we
assumed that the sympatholytic eect might be related to the
ability of amlodipine to block the  xxxg303xxx , which
is mainly distributed in the sympathetic nerve terminals to
trigger catecholamine release (hirning et al., 1988). our experimental conditions were far from the physiological state,
and clinical implications of our results are limited. the eect of
amlodipine in vivo has to be evaluated in other experimental
systems. however, the minimal concentration at which we
observed signi®cant block of the channel was quite comparable
to the clinical concentration of amlodipine (10710 to 1077 m)
(burges et al., 1989; elliot & meredith, 1991), and we believe
that our discovery provides novel clues for understanding the
eect of amlodipine on the cardiovascular system.
we are grateful to drs atsushi mikami and tsutomu tanabe for

dr nobuyuki hara and hiroshi tamura for technical assistance.
