androgen deprivation therapy with gonadotropin releasing-hormone (gnrh)
receptor agonists provides the mainstay of endocrine treatment for advanced
prostate cancer. although effective, gnrh agonists induce an initial testosterone
surge, which can cause painful and potentially dangerous clinical flare.  xxxd1826xxx 
is a novel  xxxg931xxx  blocker that provides immediate, profound and
sustained testosterone reduction, without an initial surge. in a phase iii trial,
 xxxd1826xxx  and leuprolide showed similar long-term efficacy in maintaining
testosterone levels of 0.5 ng/ml or less over 1 year, and induced significantly faster
testosterone and  xxxg1281xxx  suppression.  xxxd1826xxx  was well
tolerated; the most common side effects were mild/moderate injection-site
reactions and hot flashes. findings to date suggest that  xxxd1826xxx  may make an
important contribution to the treatment of prostate cancer.

prostate cancer (pca) is the most commonly
diagnosed malignancy in men and represents an
important public health burden across the world.
in the european union, the age-standardized
incidence rate for pca in 2006 was estimated to
be 106 per 100,000 males [1] . significant variation is observed in the incidence of pca in different countries, with estimates as low as 18.7 per
100,000 males in the republic of moldova, to
182 per 100,000 males in ireland [1] . this variation may reflect regional differences in medical care and screening policies, particularly the
use of the  xxxg1281xxx  (psa) test,
which allows early detection of pca but leads
to an overestimation of the incidence of pca in
relation to other cancers [2] .
pca rarely occurs in men younger than
50 years of age and its incidence is highest in
men aged 75 years and older [3] . with the aging
of populations in developed countries, it is anticipated that the number of individuals affected
will continue to increase, even if age-specific
incidence remains constant.
adenocarcinoma of the prostate is usually a
slow-growing cancer, and since the introduction of the psa test, most men are diagnosed
with localized disease at an early stage [4] . for
these individuals, the approach to treatment may
include watchful waiting, radical prostatectomy
or radiation therapy. hormonal therapy and
chemotherapy are usually reserved for disease
that has spread beyond the prostate. hormonal
therapy for pca involves depriving prostate cells
of androgens, which are required for their proliferation and metastasis. orchidectomy, while

highly effective at preventing the production of
androgens, is not acceptable to many patients
due to its permanency and psychological effects,
and is therefore no longer routinely used [5] .
overview of the market

currently, the most commonly used hormonal
agents in the treatment of pca are gonado­tropinreleasing hormone (gnrh) agonists. these therapies stimulate the gnrh receptors in the pituitary,
resulting in eventual suppression of gonadotropins
through desensitization of the pituitary–gonadal
axis [6] . gnrh agonists produce an initial surge
in secretion of the gonadotropin luteinizing hormone (lh), leading to secretion of androgens
(testosterone and dihydro­testosterone [dht])
for a period of 5–12 days [7–9] . chronic administration of gnrh agonists eventually leads to
suppression of lh, which results in suppression
of testosterone release.
in symptomatic patients, the initial surge in
testosterone can cause a painful and potentially
dangerous reaction, known as clinical flare. in
patients with metastatic disease, flare can precipitate a range of clinical symptoms such as
skeletal pain, ureteral obstruction and spinal
cord compression, and can lead to paralysis and,
in rare cases, death [10] . patients at greatest risk
for clinical flare are those with high-volume,
symptomatic, bony disease [11] . to block the
effects of testosterone surge, concomitant treatment with antiandrogens is commonly used in
the first few weeks of treatment with gnrh
agonists. current guidelines recommend that
anti-androgens should be started on the same

day as the gnrh agonist injection, and continued for 2 weeks in patients with advanced
disease [11] .
the negative effects of the initial testosterone
surge and requirement for concomitant use of
anti-androgens, with the additional side-effect
burden, have driven the search for alternative
approaches to reducing testosterone levels.
currently the most promising approach appears
to be through the use of  xxxg931xxx  blockers
(antagonists), which bind to the  xxxg931xxx 
and block the release of both lh and folliclestimulating hormone (fsh), thereby reducing
secretion of testosterone and dht [12–17] . in
contrast to the gnrh agonists,  xxxg931xxx  blockers do not cause an initial stimulation
of lh production, and therefore do not cause
testosterone surge or clinical flare [18] .
despite the clear advantages of  xxxg931xxx  blockers over gnrh agonists in suppressing
serum gonadal steroids, the clinical development
and successful introduction of these compounds
into clinical practice has been hampered by
practical issues such as poor solubility and unacceptable side effects, such as immediate-onset
systemic allergic reactions resulting from histamine release [14,15,19] .  xxxd51xxx  was the first gnrh
antagonist to be licensed by the us fda for the
treatment of pca [20] . however, this agent was voluntarily withdrawn from the us market in 2006,
although it is currently marketed in germany.
recent findings with the new  xxxg931xxx  blocker,  xxxd1826xxx  (ferring pharmaceuticals,
slough, uk), suggest that this compound may
provide rapid, profound and sustained reduction in testosterone levels, but without the systemic allergic reactions associated with other
gnrh antagonists.
introduction to the compound

 xxxd1826xxx  is a fully synthetic, linear decapeptide
amide containing seven unnatural amino acids,
five of which are d-amino acids (figure 1) . the
compound is water soluble (>50 mg/ml), and
upon subcutaneous administration forms a gel
that results in a sustained release into the circulation [21] . the bioavailability of  xxxd1826xxx  when
administered subcutaneously is influenced by the
dose volume and concentration: small injection
volumes increase its sub­cutaneous release compared with large volumes, and dose concentration is negatively correlated with bio­availability
[22] . pharmacokinetic modeling indicates that
 xxxd1826xxx  undergoes an initial fast release, followed by prolonged slow release [22] . the sustained release resulting from the depot formation
434

future oncol. (2009) 5(4)

provides a half life of 3–4 weeks with intramuscular or subcutaneous injection, compared with
14 h with intravenous injection [23] .
 xxxd1826xxx  immediately, competitively and
reversibly blocks gnrh receptors in the pituitary, resulting in fast suppression of lh and
fsh and, consequently, rapid testosterone suppression (figure 2) [23] . in contrast to the gnrh
agonists, this is achieved without initial stimulation of the hypothalamic–pituitary–gonadal
axis and the associated testosterone surge [17] .
furthermore,  xxxd1826xxx  has low histaminereleasing potential compared with other gnrh
antagonists [17,24–27] , and so is less likely to
generate allergic reactions.
clinical efficacy
phase ii studies

the efficacy and safety of  xxxd1826xxx  has been
evaluated in two phase ii, dose-finding studies, one conducted in europe ( xxxd1409xxx ) and the
other in north america (cs14) [28,29] . both were
open-label, randomized, parallel-group, 1-year
studies of similar overall design.
adult male patients with histologically
confirmed adenocarcinoma of the prostate, a
psa level of 2 ng/ml or more, and who were
candidates for hormonal therapy were eligible for inclusion in the two studies. exclusion
criteria included previous or current hormonal therapy for pca and treatment with any
other testosterone-modifying drugs. patients
were also excluded if they were candidates for
curative therapy. patients were discontinued if
they had an inadequate testosterone suppression (i.e., >1.0 ng/ml at one measurement, or
>0.5 ng/ml at two consecutive measurements
from 1 month onwards). in the european
study, following an initial dose of 200 or
240 mg, 187 patients received monthly maintenance doses of 80, 120 or 160 mg  xxxd1826xxx 
[28] . in the north american study, following an
initial dose of 200 mg, 127 patients received
monthly  xxxd1826xxx  doses of 60 or 80 mg [29] .
patients were treated for a period of 13 treatment cycles (each of 28 days duration) and
 xxxd1826xxx  was administered subcutaneously. a
total of 16 patients in each of the phase ii trials (representing 8.6% of patients in  xxxd1409xxx  and
12.6% in cs14) withdrew due to inadequate
testosterone suppression. however, since the
purpose of a dose-finding phase ii trial is to
identify an effective dose, it is expected that
some patients will be exposed to subtherapeutic doses, and consequently will be withdrawn
from the trial.

the primary end point for both studies was
the proportion of patients with serum testosterone at 0.5 ng/ml or less at month 1 and then at
every monthly visit up to 1 year. secondary end
points included the proportion of patients with
a testosterone level of 0.5 ng/ml or less at day 3;
time to 50 and 90% reduction of psa; time to
psa progression (defined as a psa increase of
≥50% from nadir and at least 5 ng/ml on two
consecutive visits at least 2 weeks apart); and
pharmacodynamic parameters (serum testosterone, psa, dht, lh and fsh) over time. at
the outset of the studies, the intention was to
perform the primary analysis at 6 months, but
during the course of both studies it was decided
that analysis of efficacy at 1 year would provide
data of greater interest.
overall, in both studies, 314 patients aged
47–93 years (median 73 years) received sub­
cutaneous  xxxd1826xxx  treatment [28,29] . at baseline, the median levels of testosterone and psa
were 4.1 and 20 ng/ml, respectively. baseline disease state was as follows: metastatic 19%; locally
advanced 24%; localized 30%; and m0/mx
(not t-staged) 27%.
in both studies,  xxxd1826xxx  treatment induced
fast, profound and sustained suppression of
serum testosterone levels. at day 3, 88 and 92%
of patients receiving 200 and 240 mg starting
doses, respectively, in the european study [28] ,
and 89% of patients in the north american
study, had testosterone levels of 0.5 ng/ml or
future science group

less [29] . after 1 month, 86 and 95% of patients
treated initially with 200 and 240 mg starting
doses, respectively, in the european study and
88% of patients in the north american study had
testosterone levels of 0.5 ng/ml or less (figure 3) .
serum testosterone was maintained at very low
levels throughout both studies in all treatment
groups (figure 4) . in the european study, for
patients with testosterone levels at 0.5 ng/ml or
less after 1 month, levels remained at 0.5 ng/ml
or below until the end of the study in 92, 96
and 100% of the patients treated with maintenance doses of 80, 120 and 160 mg, respectively. similarly, of the patients who had testosterone levels of 0.5 ng/ml or less after 1 month
and who attended the 1-year study visit in the
north american study, 93% (95% confidence
interval [ci]: 82–99) in the 200/60 mg group
and 98% (95% ci: 87–100) in the 200/80 mg
group maintained castrate testosterone levels
from 1 month onwards (table 1) . the findings
from the two studies suggested that the optimal
starting dose for  xxxd1826xxx  is 240 mg, and that 80
or 160 mg are the most effective doses for providing long-term testosterone suppression.
as expected, fast and sustained reductions in
lh and dht were also observed in both studies. psa levels were also rapidly reduced in both
studies, albeit more slowly than lh and dht
levels. the median times to 50 and 90% reduction in psa were 14 and 56 days, respectively, in
all treatment groups in both studies except for

point was suppression of testosterone to 0.5 ng/ml
or less at all monthly measurements from day 28
to day 364.
baseline characteristics were well balanced
between groups. the mean age at baseline
was 72 years; median serum testosterone was
3.93 ng/ml (interquartile range: 2.89–5.10),
and median psa was 19.0 ng/ml (8.70–57.5).
as observed in the phase ii trials, over 90% of
patients with testosterone levels of 0.5 ng/ml
or less at 1 month maintained these levels at
1 year (table 1) [30] .  xxxd1826xxx  was as effective
as leuprolide at maintaining testosterone levels
of 0.5 ng/ml or below from day 28 to the end
of the study period (day 364). in the intent-totreat population, this treatment response was
achieved by 97.2, 98.3 and 96.4% of patients in

0.5 ng/ml or less in 95.5 and 96.1%  xxxd1826xxx

 xxxd1826xxx  had a testosterone surge. the longterm consequences of testosterone surges and
microsurges have yet to be fully investigated.
in line with the reduction in testosterone
levels, psa levels also decreased more rapidly
in  xxxd1826xxx -treated patients than in leuprolidetreated patients [30] . after 14 days of treatment,
median psa levels had declined by 65, 64 and
18% in  xxxd1826xxx  240/160-,  xxxd1826xxx  240/80and leuprolide-treated patients, respectively;
after 28 days psa declines were 83, 85 and 68%.
 xxxd1826xxx  provided a fast and profound testosterone suppression leading to a rapid reduction in psa levels. the therapeutic benefits of
 xxxd1826xxx  were observed at least 2 weeks before
the effects of leuprolide, a gnrh agonist,
became apparent.

safety & tolerability

safety data for  xxxd1826xxx  are available from a
phase i, ii and, more recently, a phase iii trial.
in all of these studies,  xxxd1826xxx  was shown to
be well tolerated with uneventful toxicology.
the most frequently reported adverse events
in the phase ii trials were related to androgen
deprivation, namely hot flashes and fatigue, and
also to the mode of administration in the form
of injection-site reactions [28,29] . in general, the
adverse events associated with  xxxd1826xxx  were
mild to moderate in intensity and not doserelated. in total, 5 and 7% of patients withdrew
from the phase ii trials due to adverse events,
but only two of these withdrawals (one due to
injection-site urticaria and one due to depression) were considered to be related to  xxxd1826xxx

treatment. importantly, no cases of systemic
allergic reactions were documented in either of
the phase ii trials.
in the phase iii trial, the most commonly
reported adverse events with  xxxd1826xxx  were
injection-site reactions and hot flashes [30] (table 2) .
overall, adverse-event profiles were similar in the
three treatment groups, although injection-site
reactions were more common with  xxxd1826xxx  (40 vs
<1%; p < 0.001), possibly due to its sub­cutaneous
mode of administration, as were chills (4 vs 0%;
p < 0.01). while in some situations, chills can be
indicative of an allergic reaction, in the phase ii
and iii trials no systemic allergic reactions have
been reported with  xxxd1826xxx . the difference
in injection-site reactions may be explained by
the greater injection volume with  xxxd1826xxx  and
use of the subcutaneous route of administration compared with the intra­muscular route for
administering leuprolide. indeed, local injectionsite reactions have been reported with subcutaneous administration of gnrh agonists [31,32] .
the injection‑site reactions occurred predominantly after the first  xxxd1826xxx  injection; 33% of
409 starter dose injections and 4% of 2248 and
2208 maintenance dose injections (240/80 mg
and 240/160 mg groups, respectively) resulted in
injection-site events. all were documented as mild
to moderate by the patient/investigator, and five
(1%)  xxxd1826xxx -treated patients discontinued due
to injection-site reactions.
in contrast, arthralgia (9 vs 4%; p < 0.05)
and urinary tract infections (9 vs 3%; p < 0.01)
were more common during leuprolide treatment.
arthralgia is at least in part due to skeletal pain,
future science group

while urinary tract infections are most likely
disease-related.
in line with the phase ii observations, most
adverse events were mild to moderate in intensity. in total, 20% of  xxxd1826xxx  patients and 16%
of leuprolide patients discontinued the trial. of
these, 8 and 6%, respectively, withdrew due
to adverse events. no immediate- or late-onset
systemic allergic reactions were reported with
 xxxd1826xxx  in the cs21 study. overall, both
 xxxd1826xxx  and leuprolide were well tolerated in
this phase iii trial.
other gonadotropin-releasing
hormone antagonists

the only other gnrh antagonist previously
approved for clinical use,  xxxd51xxx , achieved rapid
suppression of testosterone to castrate levels in
the absence of a testosterone surge. however,
 xxxd51xxx  achieved testosterone levels of less than
50 ng/ml in 54–57% of patients by day 3/4
compared with 92–96% of patients receiving
 xxxd1826xxx  in phase ii or iii trials, respectively
[18,30] . moreover,  xxxd51xxx  was associated with
an increased risk of serious, potentially lifethreatening allergic reactions. immediate-onset
systemic allergic reactions occurred in 1.1% of
patients receiving  xxxd51xxx  in clinical trials, compared with no reported cases to date in clinical
trials of  xxxd1826xxx  [18] .

further improve outcomes in this setting. in
february 2008, ferring pharmaceuticals submitted applications in europe and the usa for the
marketing authorization of  xxxd1826xxx  at a starter
dose of 240 mg and a maintenance dose of 80 mg,
for patients with pca in whom androgen-deprivation therapy is warranted.  xxxd1826xxx  240/80 mg
subsequently received approval by the us fda in
december 2008 and by the european medicines
agency (london, uk) in february 2009. it is
indicated for treatment of patients with advanced
prostate cancer. current clinical trial data indicate
that this dose regimen is both effective and well
tolerated. from the patient’s perspective, achieving
castrate levels of testosterone without the testosterone surge will be beneficial, as there will be
no requirement for concomitant anti-androgen
therapy and no risk of initial stimulation of the
cancer. furthermore, exacerbation of associated
symptoms such as bone pain and urinary retention will be avoided. in addition, the symptoms
associated with pca may be relieved more quickly
than with gnrh agonists, and so there is potential for quality-of-life benefits – an important

consideration in a generally slowly progressing
disease such as pca. the likely development of
a 3-month depot for  xxxd1826xxx  could also permit
greater patient choice and improved convenience
in the future.
the next 5–10 years are also likely to see wider
improvements in the prevention, screening and
treatment of pca. better definition of those at high
risk of developing this disease would be useful in
optimizing screening practices. the identification
of molecular markers that help predict its natural
history would also be useful in monitoring highrisk patients, and could also support the use of psa
in monitoring response/progression in patients
undergoing androgen-deprivation therapy.
the development of androgen-independent disease is a key turning point in the natural history
of pca. treatments options are currently limited
in this setting, although the use of vaccines and
targeted therapies may become important in the
future. an ongoing aim in pca therapy is therefore
to delay the development of androgen independence for as long as possible, and further research
into the mechanisms of this process through
future science group

 xxxd1826xxx  for the treatment of prostate cancer

both  xxxg183xxx -dependent and -independent routes is critical. it has been postulated
that intermittent androgen-deprivation therapy
may delay the emergence of androgen independence. preliminary trial results have generally been
encouraging, although these have so far focused
mainly on the relative tolerability profiles rather
than the efficacy of intermittent versus continuous
androgen-deprivation regimes [33] . the tolerability
and potential quality-of-life benefits for patients
receiving intermittent therapy appear to be mostly
related to testosterone recovery during treatment
intervals eliminating symptoms of androgen suppression, particularly with respect to sexual function. phase iii trials of  xxxd1826xxx  in intermittent
therapy regimes are planned, and similar trials are
already underway for the gnrh agonists. the
results of these trials are awaited with interest as
they should better define any efficacy benefits
for intermittent therapy, as well as identify the
optimal dosing regimens and the most suitable
candidates for treatment with such regimes.
conclusion

phase iii data indicate that  xxxd1826xxx , initiated
at a dose of 240 mg and with a maintenance
dose of 80 or 160 mg, is as effective as leuprolide
over 1 year of treatment for pca and was well
tolerated.  xxxd1826xxx  provides fast, profound and
sustained suppression of testosterone without the
testosterone surge observed with gnrh agonists.
the rapid suppression of testosterone observed

drug evaluation

with  xxxd1826xxx  is accompanied by a rapid decrease
in psa levels, which contrasts with the initial
increase in psa levels observed with gnrh agonists without androgen blockage. most adverse
events were mild to moderate in intensity and
related to the mode of action of  xxxd1826xxx  – that is,
androgen deprivation or its mode of administration (subcutaneous injection). the side effects of
treatment were not dose related, and importantly,
with over 2000 patients receiving the drug, no
immediate- or late-onset allergic reactions have
been reported to date.
the effects provided by this compound are close
to those achieved with orchidectomy, without its
permanency and psychological drawbacks, and
without the initial increases in testosterone levels associated with gnrh agonists. overall, the
findings to date with  xxxd1826xxx  suggest that it has
the potential to make an important contribution
to the field of pca treatment.

executive summary
mechanism of action
n
n

 xxxd1826xxx  is a novel  xxxg930xxx  receptor blocker.
 xxxd1826xxx  immediately, competitively and reversibly blocks  xxxg930xxx  receptors in the pituitary, resulting in fast
suppression of luteinizing hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone and, consequently, rapid testosterone suppression.

administration & pharmacokinetics
n
n

n

 xxxd1826xxx  is water soluble, and upon subcutaneous administration, forms a gel that results in a sustained release into the circulation.
small injection volumes increase the subcutaneous release of  xxxd1826xxx  compared with large volumes, and dose concentration
negatively correlates with bioavailability.
sustained release from the depot formation provides a half life of 3–4 weeks on subcutaneous injection.

clinical efficacy
n

n

n
n

results from a phase iii randomized trial demonstrated that  xxxd1826xxx  240/80 mg is as effective as leuprolide at maintaining
testosterone levels of 0.5 ng/ml or less from day 28 to day 364.
testosterone levels had decreased to castrate levels in 96.1% of  xxxd1826xxx  240/80 mg-treated patients by day 3, whereas none of the
patients receiving leuprolide had testosterone levels of 0.5 ng/ml or less at this time point.
 xxxg1281xxx  levels also decreased more rapidly in the  xxxd1826xxx  group.
no patients receiving  xxxd1826xxx  had a testosterone surge, compared with 81% of those receiving leuprolide without  xxxd334xxx  for
flare protection.

safety & tolerability
n

n
n

the most common adverse events with  xxxd1826xxx  are injection-site reactions and hot flashes, and most events are mild or
moderate in intensity.
injection-site reactions occur predominantly after the first  xxxd1826xxx  injection, and reduce in frequency thereafter.
no immediate- or late-onset systemic allergic reactions have been reported with  xxxd1826xxx .
