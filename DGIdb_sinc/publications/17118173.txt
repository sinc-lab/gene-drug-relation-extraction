abstract
endometriosis is a disorder that affects 5% of the normal population but is present in up to 40% of
women with pelvic pain and/or infertility. recent evidence suggests that the endometrium of
women with endometriosis exhibits progesterone insensitivity. one endometrial protein that
fluctuates in response to progesterone is the  xxxg730xxx -alpha (er alpha), being downregulated at the time of peak progesterone secretion during the window of implantation. here we
demonstrate that the biomarker of uterine receptivity, beta 3 integrin subunit, is reduced or absent
in some women with endometriosis and that such defects are accompanied by inappropriate overexpression of er alpha during the mid-secretory phase. using a well-differentiated endometrial cell
line we showed that the beta 3 integrin protein is negatively regulated by estrogen and positively
regulated by  xxxg681xxx  (egf). by competing against estrogen with various selective
 xxxg730xxx  modulators (serms) and  xxxg730xxx  agonists and antagonists, inhibition
of expression of the beta 3 integrin by estrogen can be mitigated. in conclusion, we hypothesize
that certain types of uterine receptivity defects may be caused by the loss of appropriate er alpha
down-regulation in the mid-secretory phase, leading to defects in uterine receptivity. such changes
might be effectively treated by timely administration of the appropriate anti-estrogens to artificially
block er alpha and restore normal patterns of gene expression. such treatments will require
further clinical studies.

introduction
uterine receptivity is regulated by the cyclic secretion of
ovarian steroids as a consequence of follicular development and subsequent ovulation. as first described in the

uterus by its ability to bind estrogen [1], the classic  xxxg730xxx  ( xxxg730xxx ), increases in response to estrogen
during the proliferative phase, and is diminished in
response to progesterone during the secretory phase [2].

progesterone receptors (pr) undergo similar changes; we
and others previously reported that expression of both  xxxg730xxx  and pr are down-regulated at the time of implantation, particularly in the epithelial compartment [3-5].
while progesterone is an effective anti-estrogen, its role is
to reduce  xxxg730xxx  concentration rather than to act as a
competetive inhibitor of e2 binding, thereby rendering
the endometrium resistant to estrogen during the window
of implantation. this phenomenon has now been
observed in several mammalian species [6-8].
while steroid hormones were classically described as
stimulating gene expression, we now recognize from
genomic studies that steroid hormones can also inhibit
specific genes [9,10]. in endometrium, the decline in  xxxg730xxx  may be a critical event, releasing an inhibitory influence on specific genes and providing a signal for endometrial receptivity to commence. the highly specialized and
specific mid-secretory repertoire of endometrial gene
expression coincides with a reduction in the expression of
 xxxg730xxx  [10]. based on such studies, we now suggest that
the combination of progesterone action and coincident
estrogen withdrawal is required to stimulate key implantation-specific events in the mid-secretory phase of the
menstrual cycle.
early implantation is a complex process involving synchronous and complementary events on both maternal
and embryonic surfaces. it is now well-established that
many proteins are expressed specifically at the time when
embryos implant [11,12]. the timing of implantation has
now been firmly established, occurring around 7 to 10
days after ovulation, corresponding to days 21 to 24 of an
idealized 28 day menstrual cycle [13]. integrins are one of
many endometrial proteins that turn on or off around this
time in a woman's cycle [14,15], and the study of their
patterns of expression has yielded substantial information
about the factors that regulate endometrial receptivity in
the human [16,17]. one of these integrins is the alpha v/
beta 3 integrin that is expressed on the luminal and glandular epithelium of the endometrium. its appearance at
the time of implantation and its aberrant expression in a
variety of settings including luteal phase defect, endometriosis, polycystic ovarian syndrome (pcos) and tubal
disease suggests a critical role for this protein [18-21]. we
recently demonstrated that the reduction in endometrial
beta 3 integrin expression in pcos was associated with
elevated expression of  xxxg730xxx  and an over-expression of
steroid receptor coactivators [20]. in the present report we
examine the basis for this effect of estrogen on this particular marker of uterine receptivity and study women with
endometriosis as another group who appear to inappropriately express high levels of  xxxg730xxx  during the window of implantation.

materials and methods
patient samples
for these studies we used endometrial samples obtained
from 38 volunteers who had normal menstrual cycles and
proven fertility at various times in the menstrual cycle
(proliferative, n = 7; early secretory = 22; mid-secretory, n
= 13; late secretory = 6). some of these samples were
obtained in women undergoing bilateral tubal ligation,
each found to be free of endometriosis at laparoscopy.
the 13 mid-secretory samples were obtained in fertile
controls that were recruited and paid for their participation. in addition, 19 mid-secretory endometrial biopsies
were obtained from women with infertility that subsequently had endometriosis documented by laparoscopy.
each of these endometrial samples were selected because
they lacked epithelial expression of the alpha v/beta 3
integrin, despite having normal, "in phase" histologic
changes consistent with day 21 to 24 of the menstrual
cycle, according to the dating criteria of noyes et al [22].
all mid-secretory samples were obtained and timed to the
urinary lh surge (ovuiquick, quidel, san diego, ca). all
samples were formalin-fixed and paraffin embedded. histologic stage (endometrial dating) was assigned by two of
the investigators (ral and bal). samples were eliminated
from further consideration if there was evidence of histologic delay that exceeded 3 days compared to the expected
endometrial dating based on urinary lh testing. the
acquisition and use of human tissue for this study was
approved by the institutional review board at the university of north carolina at chapel hill and greenville hospital system, greenville, sc.
immunohistochemistry
immunostaining for  xxxg730xxx  was performed on 5-to 6-µ
sections of formalin fixed, paraffin-embedded endometrial biopsies using the vectastain elite abc kits (vector
laboratories, inc.,burlingame, ca). diaminobenzidine
(sigma, st. louis, mo) was used as the chromagen. tissue
sections were deparaffinized in xylene and hydrated in a
series of graded ethanols. following a rinse in pbs, ph
7.4, endogenous peroxidase activity was quenched upon
incubation for 30 min with 0.3% h2o2 in  xxxd102xxx , followed by a 10-min rehydration in pbs. tissue sections were heated in a microwave for 12 min in antigen
retrieval solution (10 mm citrate buffer) before incubation with primary antibody. after initial incubation with
blocking serum for 30 min at room temperature (4% normal goat serum), sections were incubated with mouse
monoclonal antibodies against human  xxxg730xxx  (novocastra, new castle upon tyne, uk) overnight at 4 c. negative controls were analyzed on adjacent sections
incubated without primary antibody. each primary antibody was serially diluted to achieve maximum sensitivity
and specificity. a pbs rinse was followed by treatment of
secondary antibody consisting of biotinylated goat anti-

mouse antibody for 30 min. after this incubation, sections were washed and incubated with avidin:biotinylated
horseradish peroxidase macromolecular complex for 60
min. visualization of peroxidase was carried out by adding diaminobenzidine and incubated for 10 min to complete the reaction. as a final step, sections were
counterstained with hematoxylin, dehydrated in a graded
series of ethanols, cleared with xylene, and a coverslip
placed over permount for evaluation by light microscopy.
the resulting staining was evaluated using a nikon microscope (tokyo, japan), by a single observer (b.a.l.) without knowledge of the specimen's identity. assessment of
staining intensity and distribution was made using the
semi-quantitative histologic score (hscore) system in
the glandular and luminal epithelium and in the stromal
compartment. hscore was calculated using the following equation: hscore: ∑ pi (i + 1), where i represents the
intensity of staining ranging from 1, 2, or 3, (representing
weak, moderate or strong, respectively) and pi representing the percentage of stained endometrial stromal and
epithelial cells for each intensity, varying from 0–100%.
cell culture and western blot analysis
ishikawa cells, the well differentiated endometrial carcinoma cell line, were obtained from dr. m. nishida
(kasumigaura national hospital, tsuchiura-shi, ibarakiken, japan) and maintained in mem (life technologies,
inc., grand island, ny) containing 5% charcoal stripped
fetal bovine serum (fbs), 1% pencillin-streptomycin (life
technologies, inc., grand island, ny) and 2 mm lglutamine (life technologies, inc., grand island, ny) at
37°c in the presence of 5% co2. the culture medium
was changed every 2–3 days. this cell line contains a functional  xxxg730xxx  and as evident by estrogeninduced alkaline phosphatase enzyme activity bioassay,
has been successfully used as a measure of estrogenic
activity in these cells [23,24]. cells were treated in phenol
red-free dmem/f12 media with 0.5% heat-inactivated
charcoal-stripped fbs, 1% pencillin-streptomycin and 2
mm l-glutamine. cells plated onto 100 mm dishes were
exposed to medium alone (control) or medium containing 17beta-estradiol (e2; 10-8 mol/l; sigma) and/or  xxxg681xxx  (egf; 10 ng/ml) individually or in
combination with the estrogen antagonist,  xxxd2165xxx 
(10-6 mol/l; zeneca pharmaceuticals, wilmington, de) or
 xxxd467xxx  antibody (30 nm/ml; monoclonal antibody that
neutralizes the egf receptor, provided by imclone, inc.
(new york, ny). in other experiments cells were treated
with and with e2 (10-8 mol/l; sigma), estriol (e3; 10-8
mol/l; sigma) or equimolar concentrations (10-8m) of
selective  xxxg730xxx  modulators (serms:  xxxd1726xxx , tamoxifen, raloxifene) the time of exposure in each experiment was 72 h.

for immunoblotting of ishikawa cell extracts, cells treated
as described above were harvested individually and cell
pellets obtained from the respective treatments were
resuspended in ripa extraction buffer (10 mm tris-hcl
[ph 8.0], 10 mm edta [ph 8.0], 150 mm nacl, 1% np40, and 0.5% sds) containing protease-inhibitor cocktail
(boehringer mannheim, indianapolis, in). after centrifugation  xxxd1891xxx  000 × g for 10 min, protein concentrations
were determined using the bio-rad protein assay kit (biorad laboratories, hercules, ca). total proteins (100 µg
from each treatment) were denatured in laemmli buffer,
electrophoresed on 10% sds-containing polyacrylamide
gel and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane. blots
were blocked for 1 h in tbst (20 mm tris [ph 7.5], 137
mm nacl, and 0.4% tween-20) containing 10% nonfat
dry milk. blots were washed twice for 5 min each time in
tbst, then incubated overnight with a 1:1000 dilution of
monoclonal antibody against alpha v/beta 3 integrin
(ssa6; a generous gift from james hoxie, university of
pennsylvania, philadelphia, pa) while rocking at 4°c.
the blots were then washed twice for 30 min each time
with tbst, followed by incubation for 1 h at room temperature with peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse igg secondary antibody while rocking. after washing twice for 30
min each time with tbst, the immunoreactive protein
complexes were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (amersham pharmacia biotech inc., piscataway,
nj). the results depicted are representative of 2 independent experiments.
statistical analysis
comparisons between treatment groups were analyzed
using anova with scheffe's correction for multiple comparisons using 95% confidence interval (p < 0.05). analysis was performed on a dell pc with graphpad prism 4
software.

results
the pattern of expression for  xxxg730xxx  changed throughout the menstrual cycle, as judged by immunohistochemistry. as shown in figures 1a–c and 2a–c, the temporal
and spatial pattern of  xxxg730xxx  was dynamic, with
increased expression in glandular, luminal, and stromal
compartments in the proliferative and early secretory
phases, and a subsequent decline in the mid to late-secretory phases. based on hscore determinations, the
expression of  xxxg730xxx  in all three cell types was significantly lower in the secretory than the proliferative phase.
luminal epithelium exhibited reduced  xxxg730xxx  immunostaining relative to glandular epithelium. stromal cells
also were devoid of  xxxg730xxx  immunostaining during the
time of maximal uterine receptivity in normal fertile samples. later in the secretory phase,  xxxg730xxx  immunostaining returned to the stromal compartment but little if any

immunostaining was observed in the epithelium in normal fertile controls.
women with endometriosis who exhibited an aberrant
lack of the alpha v/beta 3 integrin, as a group exhibited a
significantly higher level of  xxxg730xxx  expression in epithelial cells compared to normal fertile controls. examples of
this are shown in figure 1d and 1e. a comparison of  xxxg730xxx  staining intensity and distribution (hscore) is
also shown in figure 2d comparing glandular and luminal  xxxg730xxx  distribution only. note the higher levels of
 xxxg730xxx  immunostaining in both cell types in women
with endometriosis and suspected defects in uterine
receptivity compared to normal women during the midsecretory phase.
to understand the mechanism of the action of estrogen
on beta 3 integrin expression, we used the hormone
responsive, well-differentiated, ishikawa cell line. these
cells mimic the pattern of gene expression for endometrial
epithelium and provide a model to study factors that regulate specific genes in human endometrium [23,25-29].
as shown in figure 3, using western blotting analysis, we
show that estrogen strongly inhibits the expression of the
beta 3 integrin subunit in ishikawa cells, while egf significantly increases its expression. blockade of the egf receptor with a neutralizing antibody ( xxxd467xxx ) mitigates this
effect by egf. likewise, e2 counteracts the stimulatory
effect of egf on beta 3 expression. the absolute estrogen
antagonist, ( xxxd2165xxx ) released the inhibitor effect of
estradiol on beta 3 integrin expression, as well. this experiment suggests that the beta 3 gene product is regulated in
endometrial epithelium by dual mechanisms that
includes both stimulatory and inhibitory components
and that estrogen inhibition appears to be dominant over
egf stimulation.
if inhibitory factors block the expression of beta 3
integrin, we next asked how different estrogens or antiestrogens might compare as potential treatments for loss
of the beta 3 integrin. to examine the effect of various
selective  xxxg730xxx  modulators to reverse this
inhibitor effect of estrogen, we pretreated ishikawa cells
with estradiol and then added equimolar quantities of
either the weak estrogen (estriol; e3), the serms  xxxd1726xxx , tamoxifen, raloxifene and the anti-esrogen
 xxxd2165xxx . as noted in figure 4, tamoxifen and  xxxd1726xxx  did little to restore normal beta 3 integrin
expression.  xxxd2165xxx  was the most potent anti-estrogen
in terms of reversing inhibition of beta 3 protein. surprisingly, raloxifene was a fairly potent anti-estrogen in the
endometrial cells, as it induced reasonable inhibition of
the negative effect of estradiol on beta 3 integrin expression in ishikawa cells.

discussion
estrogen action has traditionally been considered
mitogenic and stimulatory in most target cells. during the
proliferative phase, estrogen stimulates a large number of
genes including c-fos and c-jun, cell cycle proteins and the
 xxxg730xxx  itself [30,31]. exposed to unopposed
estrogen, the endometrium undergoes hypertrophy and
hyperplasia and eventually risks becoming neoplastic in
the absence of cyclic progesterone exposure. as shown in
the present study, estrogen appears to inhibit expression
of specific proteins, a role we would argue is confined to
select genes that are expressed during the window of
implantation. while estrogen is a major hormone in the
proliferative phase, it was previously argued that estrogen
is unnecessary for the normal development of the secretory phase endometrium [32]. in our view, the disappearance of  xxxg730xxx  at the time of implantation as seen in
most mammalian species, argues that continued  xxxg730xxx 
expression may be detrimental to the development of
uterine receptivity, or at least a sign of other dysfunction
in the endometrial cycle.
based on expected steroid receptor changes, the loss of er
during the mid-secretory phase provides a time in the
cycle when mitoses cease and implantation occurs. in this
study we documented, again, this decline in  xxxg730xxx  that
has previously been described [3,4]. such changes in steroid receptors may account for the four stages of the
endometrial cycle as defined by recent dna microarray
studies [10]. in the first, estrogen works alone to stimulate
 xxxg730xxx  and pr isoforms and to increase expression of a
host of genes necessary for cell division and tissue growth.
with ovulation, in the early secretory phase, progesterone
acts to halt cell division and to induce secretory changes.
in the third (mid-secretory) phase,  xxxg730xxx  largely disappears, providing for the first time, the opportunity for progesterone to act alone, specifically targeting the stroma
[3]. the stroma contributes paracrine activity in response
to progesterone, stimulating epithelial gene expression
indirectly [16]. during the late luteal phase,  xxxg730xxx 
appears to return to the stromal compartment, reflecting
the time of sloughing and regeneration that will soon follow if pregnancy does not occur.
the elevation in  xxxg730xxx  that we describe in this study,
corresponds to the lack of beta 3 integrin in selected
patients with endometriosis. we described similar findings in women with polycystic ovarian syndrome (pcos).
this is another condition associated with infertility and
pregnancy wastage. while  xxxg730xxx  is elevated in pcos
and beta 3 levels are low, the pathophysiology may be
quite different between the two diagnoses. in the former,
chronic estrogen may alter the complement of steroid
receptor coactivators that are present; in endometriosis,
elevations in aromatase have been described, possibly

raising the local production of estrogen. alternatively,
faulty progesterone receptors have been reported in this
disorder. in this study, we document that  xxxg730xxx  is
increased in women with suspected defects in uterine
receptivity lacking the egf stimulated and estrogen inhibited gene, beta 3.
we suspect that there will be many genes other than beta
3 integrin subunit that are regulated in concert during
implantation in response to egf and the loss of  xxxg730xxx .
there are likely to be many other endometrial genes that
are inhibited by e2 and, like the beta 3 integrin protein,
are only expressed when  xxxg730xxx  is down-regulated
around the mid-secretory phase. conversely, any failure

to down-regulate er alpha in infertile women may predispose to altered gene expression, including failure to
express essential proteins associated with uterine receptivity [19]. such defects have been described in the
endometrium of women with endometriosis [33,34],
luteal phase defect (lpd), and polycystic ovarian syndrom (pcos) [19,20,35], each of which is associated with
either infertility or pregnancy loss.
what might account for the aberrant down-regulation of
 xxxg730xxx  by the time of implantation in all of these different disorders? in lpd, the timing of  xxxg730xxx  down-regulation is delayed, perhaps due to inadequate progesterone
levels in the serum [36]. for endometriosis patients, it is

concentrations of other anti-estrogens and serms, a differential competitive antagonism occurred with the most potent antagonism by  xxxd2165xxx ,780. raloxifene had an anti-estrogen effect on this well-differentiated endometrial cell line as well. con =

clear that the endometrium of women with endometriosis
is different from normal endometrium [33,34,37]. an
important difference between eutopic endometrium from
women with and without endometriosis is also inappropriate expression of aromatase [38,39]. if aromatase
increases local estrogen production within the
endometrium, this might alter the balance between estrogen and progesterone and could therefore account for the

elevation in  xxxg730xxx  observed in this study. alternatively, increased il-6 has been demonstrated in the
endometrium of women with endometriosis. il-6 was
recently shown in breast cancer cells to activate er and
this could lead to increased  xxxg730xxx  expression [40,41].
whether this effect is mediated through modulation of
aromatase is not clear. in endometriosis patients, defects
in the  xxxg1737xxx  have been postulated [37].

loss of progesterone activity may result in the persistence
of  xxxg730xxx , since down-regulation of er is one of the primary actions of progesterone. finally, in pcos, we suspect that elevated  xxxg730xxx  levels are also associated with
a decrease in uterine receptivity. in this case, however, the
failure to down-regulate  xxxg730xxx  may be due to a hypersensitivity to estrogen, as evidenced by the over-expression of steroid receptor coactivators and  xxxg730xxx  itself
[20].
thus, uterine receptivity defects may represent a common
pathway for many women with infertility. the presence of
 xxxg730xxx  in mid-luteal endometrium may be the best
biomarker of a dysfunctional endometrium. treatment of
such defects might be designed to block the estrogen
receptor or to correct the underlying cause of its overexpression. in women with elevated  xxxg730xxx  during the
window of implantation, short-term treatment with antiestrogens may prove useful. if raloxifene were used, for
example, its anti-estrogenic blockage of  xxxg730xxx  activity
may result in a normalization of biomarkers of uterine
receptivity. to our knowledge, no one has suggested such
a novel use of anti-estrogens, to stimulate uterine receptivity. alternatives to anti-estrogens might also include the
use of stronger progestins or the use of aromatase inhibitors. only appropriately designed clinical trials will we be
able to address these possibilities. given the large number
of women that might be affected, (e.g. pcos, endometriosis or lpd) the potential benefits are substantial. a simple and direct treatment to restore normal uterine
receptivity in the cycle of conception would truly be an
enormous advance in our approach to women with
implantation failure.
