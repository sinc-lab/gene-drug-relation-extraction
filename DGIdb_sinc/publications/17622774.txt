abstract
the contribution of -adrenoceptor subtypes to the catecholamine-mediated relaxations in gastric fundus from control and  xxxd3249xxx  (stz)-induced diabetic rats were investigated. isolated organ bath studies and molecular
techniques were used to characterize the -adrenoceptor
subtypes mediating relaxation of rat gastric fundus.  xxxd2398xxx -mediated relaxation was not significantly changed by
 xxxd2689xxx  (1-/2-adrenoceptor antagonist; 1 mol/l) but only
shifted to the right by sr59230a (3-(2-ethylphenoxy)-1[[(1s)-1,2,3,4-tetrahydronaphth-1-yl]amino]-(2s)- xxxd2400xxx  oxalate salt, 0.1–1 mol/l), a selective 3-adrenoceptor
antagonist, in a competitive manner. relaxant responses
to noradrenaline were antagonized in a concentration-dependent manner by sr59230a (0.1–1 mol/l), but not by
metoprolol (selective 1-adrenoceptor antagonist; 0.1–1
mol/l) and ici-118551 (1-[2,3-(dihydro-7-methyl-1hinden4-yl)oxy]-3-[(1-methylethyl)amino]-2-butanol
hydrochloride, selective 2-adrenoceptor antagonist; 0.1–1 mol/l).
sr59230a (1 mol/l) also caused a significant rightward shift
in  xxxd2098xxx -induced relaxation while ici-118551 (1 mol/l)
did not have any effect. selective 3-adrenoceptor agonist,
brl37344 ([4-[2-[[2-(3-chlorophenyl)-2-hydroxyethyl]amin
o]propyl]phenoxy]acetic acid), caused biphasic relaxation
which was not affected by  xxxd2689xxx  (1 mol/l). sr59230a
(1 mol/l) abolished only the first phase of brl37344 re-

sponse. 1-, 2- and 3-adrenoceptor mrna expressions
have been detected in a similar intensity in gastric fundus
from control rats. experimental diabetes caused a significant
decrease in emax and pd2 values of  xxxd2398xxx  and noradrenaline. diabetes also reduced emax but not pd2 value of
the first component of brl37344-induced relaxation response. the band intensity of mrna transcript of 3-adrenoceptor was reduced in diabetics while no alteration has been
found for 1- and 2-adrenoceptor mrna transcripts between groups. these results show that functional -adrenoceptor subtype involved in catecholamine-mediated relaxations is 3-adrenoceptor, and its function and mrna
expression are decreased in diabetes.

introduction

depending on the functional and molecular developments for the characterization of -adrenoceptor subtypes in different tissues, it has been proven that 3-adrenoceptor distinctly from 1- and 2-adrenoceptor plays
a pivotal role in the lipolysis of white and brown adipocytes [1], relaxation of airway [2] and vasculature [3], and
modulation of the negative inotropy in the heart [4].
-adrenoceptors are also important in the regulation
of gastric smooth muscle tone. until the 1980s, the 1-adrenoceptor had been known as the subtype which is associated with the -adrenoceptor-mediated responses
in gastrointestinal smooth muscle [5]. however, the
responses resistant to antagonism by classical 1- and

materials and methods
animals
the experiments were performed on 8-week-old male spraguedawley rats, weighing 200–250 g. the rats were housed 2 per cage
in a room with controlled temperature (22 8 1 ° c) and 12-h
light:12-h dark cycles. food and water were available ad libitum.
these experiments were carried out in accordance with the guidelines of ankara university animal care and use committee.
tissue preparation and incubation
rats were killed under thiopental sodium (50 mg/kg, i.p.) anesthesia. after the stomach contents were removed and dissected
free of connective tissue, gastric fundus was prepared as longitudinal strips (15 mm long, 3 mm wide) according to the method of
vane [20]. the gastric mucosae were carefully removed from the
muscle layer. two preparations were obtained from each animal.
strips were mounted vertically under an initial isometric tension
of 1 g in a 10-ml organ bath, containing krebs solution of the following composition (mmol/l): nacl 118, kcl 4.7, cacl2 2.5,
 xxxd2534xxx . 7h2o 1.2, kh2po4 1.2, nahco3 25, and glucose 11.1.
tissue bath solutions were maintained at 37 ° c and bubbled
continuously with 95% o2/5% co2 (ph 7.4). prednisolone (0.1
mol/l, an extraneuronal uptake inhibitor),  xxxd3000xxx  (0.1 mol/l,
-adrenoceptor antagonist) and  xxxd228xxx  (30 mol/l, to prevent oxidation of catecholamines) were present in the medium
throughout all experiments. tissue strips were equilibrated for 60
min before the experimental procedures began.
experimental protocols
initially, carbachol concentration response curves (crcs)
(0.001–30 mol/l) were performed and the concentration producing 80% of maximum contraction (ec80) was determined. in
most cases, this was between 1 and 3 mol/l. once carbachol-induced contraction reached steady state, agonists (noradrenaline,
 xxxd2098xxx , brl37344 and  xxxd2398xxx ; 0.001–100 mol/l) were
added cumulatively. in the presence of antagonists (metoprolol,
ici-118551, sr59230a and  xxxd2689xxx ), one control crc of agonist
( xxxd2398xxx  and noradrenaline) was followed by three crcs
with increasing concentration of antagonist (except the protocol
with  xxxd2398xxx  in the presence of sr59230a; for more details,
see results). antagonists were added 45 min before each crc was
performed. since there was a possibility that agonist relaxation
responses were affected by time-dependent changes, some preparations received no antagonist and served as controls to assess
time-dependent changes on  xxxd2398xxx  and noradrenaline-induced relaxations by calculating the rightward shifts without any
antagonist [14].
it was shown that the relaxations obtained from brl37344
crcs were significantly decreased due to desensitization [14].
therefore, the effects of antagonists ( xxxd2689xxx  and sr59230a) on
the brl37344-mediated relaxation responses were investigated
on one of the strips obtained from the same animal while the
other was evaluated as control brl37344 crc only.
in order to block the 1- and 2-adrenoceptors in the rat gastric fundus, 0.3 and 1 mol/l propranolol were used in previous
studies [14, 15]. in our study, 1 mol/l  xxxd2689xxx  was chosen as suitable concentration for the same purpose.

2-adrenoceptor antagonists like propranolol lead to
raise doubts about the existence of novel and atypical adrenoceptor subtype(s) different from 1- and 2-adrenoceptors [6]. it has been clearly shown that atypical adrenoceptors which are expressed in different parts of
gastrointestinal tract mediate relaxation in smooth muscles preparations such as esophagus [7], stomach [8], ileum [9], duodenum [10], jejenum [11] and colon [12, 13]
in different species including guinea pig, rat and rabbit.
today, the rat ileal and colonic ‘atypical’ -adrenoceptors
have been accepted as 3-adrenoceptor [9, 13].
atypical -adrenoceptors in rat gastric fundus were
first characterized by mclaughlin and macdonald [14].
afterwards, a strong relationship between the ‘atypical’
-adrenoceptor in rat gastric fundus and the cloned rat
3-adrenoceptor was demonstrated [15]. since then, there
has been no comprehensive study about gene expressions
and functional contributions of -adrenoceptor subtypes
to catecholamine-mediated responses by using selective
1-, 2- and 3-adrenoceptor agonists and antagonists in
rat gastric fundus.
the neuromuscular abnormalities of the stomach due
to diabetes are referred to as ‘diabetic gastropathy’ [16].
because diabetic neuropathy affects the parasympathetic
and sympathetic nervous system, it may play a role in the
pathophysiology of gastric neuromuscular problems that
is seen in diabetics. however, no correlation has been
found between the severity of diabetic neuropathy and
diabetic gastroparesis [16]. on the other hand, several
studies have shown both structural and functional changes in gastrointestinal smooth muscles including fundus,
duodenum, jejenum and ileum of experimental diabetic
rats. some of functional changes may be related to the
sensitivity of receptors to certain agonists and/or to altered number of receptors [17]. impaired fundic relaxation to -adrenoceptor agonists has been considered
one of the responsible mechanisms for diabetic gastropathy in rats [18, 19]. sakai et al. [18] showed that the decreased relaxation response mediated by  xxxd2398xxx 
was related to the reduced number of -adrenoceptors in
gastric fundus from diabetic rats. however, the effect of
diabetes on -adrenoceptor subtypes was not specifically investigated in this tissue.
therefore, the present study was undertaken for two
purposes: (1) to determine functionally predominant adrenoceptor subtype(s) which are responsible for catecholamine-induced relaxation and (2) to examine the
possible effects of long-term diabetes on -adrenoceptor
subtypes in rat gastric fundus by using molecular and
pharmacological techniques.

experimental protocols in stz-diabetic rats
the same carbachol-induced precontraction protocol was
used in fundus from both control and stz-diabetic rats. after the
determination of ec80, differences between -adrenoceptor-mediated relaxant responses of control and diabetic groups were investigated. firstly, on the precontracted preparations, agonist
(noradrenaline or  xxxd2398xxx ) crc (0.001–30 mol/l) was performed. after a 15-min washing period, the preparations were
contracted a second time for brl37344 crc. in this series of
experiments, we used brl37344 at a concentration of 0.001–
1 mol/l to evaluate specifically 3-adrenoceptor-mediated responses (for details, see results).
data and statistical analysis
all results are expressed as mean 8 sem of number of experiments. the relaxant action of the agonists was determined by
measuring the percentage decrease on the tone produced by carbachol. agonistic potency was expressed as a pd2 value calculated
with non-linear regression. the affinity of antagonist was determined by schild plot analyses [21] and x-intercept of the schild
plot was taken as pa2 value. antagonism was considered to be
simple competitive in nature if the slope of the regression line was
not significantly different from unity. in some experiments where
only one concentration of antagonist was tested or where the
schild plot was clearly non-linear, the antagonist affinity was expressed as pk b instead of pa2. pk b values were calculated according to pk b = log(cr-1) – log[antagonist], where cr was the dose
ratio between the ec50 value for an agonist in the presence of a
given antagonist concentration and the ec50 value in the absence
of the antagonist. statistical significance between two data sets
was tested by paired or unpaired student’s t test. the probability
level of p ! 0.05 was considered to be statistically significant.
total rna extractions, cdna preparation and amplification
of cdna encoding 1-, 2-, and 3-adrenoceptors by rt-pcr
rat gastric fundus smooth muscle tissue was powdered with
liquid nitrogen and stored at –80 ° c. total rna was extracted using sv total rna isolation system (promega, madison, wisc.,
usa). the optical density (od) values of each sample were determined spectrophotometrically using nanodrop (nanodrop technologies, wilmington, del., usa) at wavelength 260 nm (260) and
280 nm (280) and the od 260/od 280 ratio was used as a cursory estimation of rna quality. rt-pcr experiments were performed using improm-ii reverse transcription system (promega). mrnas were obtained using oligo dt (0.5 g) primer from
total rnas. briefly, 1 l oligo dt was added to equivalent amounts
of total rna from control rat gastric fundus smooth muscle. the
mixtures were then placed into a thermocycler (hybaid, pcr express, uk) and held at 70 ° c for 5 min. mrnas were used as tem-

plates for the synthesis of cdna strains by reverse transcriptase.
for this, 5! rt buffer, deoxynucleotide triphosphate (dntp) (0.5
mmol), mgcl2 (3 mmol), rnasin (1 u/l) and reverse transcriptase (1 l) were added; water was added to a final volume of 20 l.
the tubes were again placed into thermocycler and heated for 60
min at 42 ° c for rt, followed by 15 min at 70 ° c for denaturation.
first strand cdna samples were then cooled to 4 ° c and stored at
–80 ° c until use. the single strand cdnas were consequently amplified by pcr using gene-specific primers for rat 1-adrenoceptor
(forward 5-gccgatctggtcatggga-3 and reverse 5-gttgtagcagcggcgcg-3), 2-adrenoceptor (forward 5-acctctcctccttgcctatcca-3 and reverse 5-taggttttcgaagaagaccg-3), 3-adrenoceptor (forward 5-agtgggactcctcgtaatg-3 and reverse 5-cgcttagctacgacgaac-3) and -actin (forward, 5-cgtaaagacctctatgccaa-3 and reverse 5-agccatgccaaatgtgtcat-3) and
taq dna polymerase. 10! reaction buffer, dntp (0.5 mmol),
mgcl2 (2.8–3.8 mmol), taq dna polymerase (1 u), cdna (5 l)
and 2 l (10 pmol/ml) of respective sense and antisense primers
were added to pcr tubes. diethylpyrocarbonate-treated water was
then added to each tube for a final volume of 50 l. the samples
were then mixed and placed in the thermocycler. following initial
heating of samples at 94 ° c for 3 min (denaturation), each cycle of
amplification consisted of 3 min at 94 ° c (denaturation), 1 min at
annealing temperature appropriate for the primers used and 2 min
at 72 ° c (extension). this sequence was repeated for a total of 35
cycles. -actin was amplified in each set of pcr reactions and
these genes served as internal references during quantitation to
correct for operator and/or experimental variations. at the end of
the reactions, 25 l of each pcr product were mixed with 5 l 6!
blue orange loading dye. the samples are then loaded onto a 1.5%
agarose gel containing ethidium bromide and electrophoresed for
1 h at 100 v (sci-plas, uk). the resulting gels were visualized using an uv transilluminator (viber loumat tfx 20m uv, marnela-vallée, france) and photographed using uv gel camera (kodak
edas 290, usa). the expected lengths of the fragments were 327
basepairs (bp) for 1-adrenoceptor, 560 bp for 2-adrenoceptor
and 444 bp for 3-adrenoceptor.

responses to noradrenaline
in the presence of  xxxd3000xxx  (0.1 mol/l), noradrenaline relaxed carbachol-induced tone in the rat gastric fundus with a pd2 value of 6.04 8 0.06 (n = 24). there is no
significant time-dependent and/or repeated crc-dependent decrease in the sensitivity of tissues to noradrenaline
(data not shown). the selective 1-adrenoceptor antagonist, metoprolol (0.1, 0.3, 1 mol/l) and the selective 2adrenoceptor antagonist, ici-118551 (0.1, 0.3, 1 mol/l)
slightly inhibited the noradrenaline-induced relaxation
response (fig. 2a, c). however, schild plots for metoprolol

and ici-118551 had slope values which were significantly
different from unity (for metoprolol, 0.42 8 0.06, n = 5;
for ici-118551, 0.37 8 0.17, n = 5) with pa2 values of 7.42
8 0.24 and 7.10 8 0.35, respectively (fig. 2b, d). the selective 3-adrenoceptor antagonist, sr59230a (0.1, 0.3,
1 mol/l) shifted the noradrenaline crc rightward in a
concentration-dependent manner (fig. 2e). the slope of
the schild plot was very similar to the unity (1.03 8 0.08).
the calculated pa2 value for this antagonism was 7.91 8
0.07 (n = 5) (fig. 2f).
responses to  xxxd2098xxx 
 xxxd2098xxx , a selective 2-adrenoceptor agonist, caused
concentration-dependent relaxation on the carbacholprecontracted rat gastric fundus (pd2 = 5.48 8 0.07, n =
14). after the time-dependent and/or repeated crc-dependent rightward shifts were corrected (data not shown),
this relaxation had a pd2 of 5.02 8 0.15 (n = 4), and
was not significantly antagonized by ici-118551 (pkb =
6.05 8 0.08, 1 mol/l, n = 4). however,  xxxd2098xxx  crc
shifted to rightward with sr59230a (pkb = 7.71 8 0.11,
1 mol/l, n = 5) (fig. 3).
responses to brl37344
brl37344 (0.01–100 mol/l), a selective 3-adrenoceptor agonist, induced a concentration-dependent relaxation in rat gastric fundus. the brl37344-induced relaxations were noticeably slower than  xxxd2398xxx  (fig. 4a,
b). the relaxation caused by brl37344 was biphasic
(fig. 4b). the first component of response (0.01–1 mol/l)
was characterized by a slow and flat relaxation profile
(pd2 (1) = 7.13 8 0.19, n = 5). the second part (1–100
mol/l), however, was characterized by a fast and sharp
reduction on carbachol-induced tone (pd2 (2) = 4.87 8
0.14, n = 5). both components of brl37344 crc were
resistant to the antagonist effect of  xxxd2689xxx  (1 mol/l)
(in the presence of  xxxd2689xxx , 1 mol/l; pd2 (1) = 7.30 8
0.11, pd2 (2) = 4.86 8 0.11, n = 5) (fig. 5a). sr59230a
(1 mol/l) abolished the first but not second component of brl37344 crc (in the absence of sr59230a
pd2 (2) = 4.83 8 0.16, n = 4; in the presence of sr59230a,
1 mol/l, pd2 (2) = 4.69 8 0.13, n = 4) (fig. 5b).
detection of -adrenoceptor mrna in rat gastric
fundus
rt-pcr was used to detect 1-adrenoceptor, 2-adrenoceptor, 3-adrenoceptor and -actin mrna in longitudinal smooth muscle of rat gastric fundus. the mrna
expressions of 1-, 2- and 3-adrenoceptors were found
at the expected sizes with similar intensity (fig. 6).

adrenoceptor antagonist,  xxxd2689xxx  (0.1, 1, 10, 100 mol/l)
antagonized crcs to  xxxd2398xxx  in a concentration-dependent manner. however, when taking a time-dependent decrease in the sensitivity of the tissues to  xxxd2398xxx  into consideration (fig. 1a), the corresponding schild
plot analyses showed that the slope of the plot was significantly different from unity (0.46 8 0.07, n = 14), and
the antagonism was not in a competitive manner (fig. 1b,
c).  xxxd2689xxx  inhibited these relaxant responses with the
following pkb values: 7.22 8 0.09, 0.1 mol/l; 6.29 8
0.09, 1 mol/l; 5.92 8 0.14, 10 mol/l; 5.52 8 0.16, 100
mol/l.
the selective 3-adrenoceptor antagonist, sr59230a
(0.1, 0.3, 1 mol/l) caused concentration-dependent
rightward shifts in the  xxxd2398xxx  crc. in our preliminary studies, log(cr-1) values produced by sr59230a at
low concentrations (0.1 and 0.3 mol/l) against  xxxd2398xxx  was found to be lower than 0. to assess whether these
concentrations of sr59230a produced meaningful shifts
without regard to time-dependent changes, the effect of
sr59230a on  xxxd2398xxx -induced relaxations was investigated on one of the strips obtained from the same
animal while the other was evaluated as control  xxxd2398xxx  crc only. the slope of schild plot was not found
significantly different from unity (0.97 8 0.08, n = 12).
this result showed that the antagonism appeared to be
simple competitive in nature. the pa2 value for sr59230a
was 7.27 8 0.08 (fig. 1d, e).

discussion

a great deal of evidence in this study indicates that 3adrenoceptor is the predominant -adrenoceptor subtype that mediates catecholamine-induced relaxation in
rat gastric fundus. actually, the existence of atypical

-adrenoceptors different from 1- and 2-adrenoceptors has been shown by mclaughlin and macdonald [14].
afterwards, cohen et al. [15] demonstrated that atypical
-adrenoceptor mediating relaxation in rat gastric fundus was the 3-adrenoceptor based on the findings including antagonist dissociation constants of propranolol
and cyanopindolol, the potency of cl316243 (a 3-adrenoceptor agonist), the presence of 3-adrenoceptor
mrna and the correlation of the activity of some -adrenoceptor agonists between rat gastric fundus and cloned
3-adrenoceptor in chinese hamster ovary cells. since
then, there has been no comprehensive study about the
role of 3-adrenoceptor in rat gastric fundus.
today, four pharmacological criteria have been used
to claim the effect to be mediated through 3-adrenoceptor [13]: (i) resistance to blockade by antagonists possessing only high affinity for 1- and 2-adrenoceptor, (ii)
stimulation by 3-adrenoceptor agonists, (iii) blockade
by 3-adrenoceptor antagonists, and (iv) stimulation by
non-conventional partial agonists. however, in recent
years cgp12177 (a non-conventional partial agonist) has
been found to be the selective agonist of 4-adrenoceptor,
the low affinity state of 1-adrenoceptor [22]. therefore,
the first three criteria were examined in our experimental
protocol for characterization of 3-adrenoceptor in rat
gastric fundus.

effects of chronic diabetes on relaxant responses
there was no significant difference in precontraction
level of fundus strips from control (157.9 8 7.9 mn, n =
11) and diabetic (135.4 8 7.9 mn, n = 15) rats. in diabetics, both emax and pd2 values of  xxxd2398xxx  and noradrenaline crcs were decreased (table 1; fig. 7a, b). our
previous findings in the present study clearly showed that
low concentrations of brl37344 (0.001–1 mol/l) caused
relaxation by means of 3-adrenoceptor activation.
therefore, the effect of chronic diabetes on 3-adrenoceptor was assessed on first component of brl37344-mediated relaxation profile. the emax value but not the pd2
of brl37344-mediated relaxations were decreased significantly when compared with controls (table 1; fig. 7c).
chronic diabetes caused a significant decrease (26.1%)
in mrna transcript of 3-adrenoceptor while no alteration has been found for 1- and 2-adrenoceptor mrna
levels when compared with control (fig. 6). -actin, a
gene served as internal reference, was amplified to correct
experimental variations during quantitation in all pcr
reactions.

for initial characterization, the relaxation mediated
by  xxxd2398xxx  in gastric fundus has been examined.
the contribution of -adrenoceptor subtypes on  xxxd2398xxx -mediated responses was tested by using  xxxd2689xxx .  xxxd2689xxx  inhibited these relaxant responses with a
pk b value of 6.3 at 1 mol/l and 3.14-fold rightward
shift. this value is in agreement with findings reported
previously with propranolol (pk b = 6.31, 1 mol/l) in rat
gastric fundus [14]. however, compared with the given
pk b values of 8.2–8.8 for 1- and 2-adrenoceptor in
atria and trachea [23], our pk b value indicated a ‘resistant’ response. in addition, the slope of schild plot is
significantly different from unity. these observations
suggest that the major component of  xxxd2398xxx -mediated responses is independent of 1/2-adrenoceptor

subtypes. to investigate the contribution of 3-adrenoceptor on  xxxd2398xxx -mediated relaxation more directly, the affinity of sr59230a was evaluated. it produced concentration-dependent rightward shifts of  xxxd2398xxx  crc without any effect on emax. the slope of
schild plot that is not significantly different from unity
indicates that the antagonism produced by sr59230a
on  xxxd2398xxx  crc is competitive in nature. the pa2
value obtained (7.3) was found to be similar to the reported pa2 values in rat gastric fundus (7.4) [14], guineapig gastric fundus (7.3–7.8) [24], rat distal colon (7.1)
[12] and guinea-pig ileum (7.6) [25] by using selective
3-adrenoceptor antagonists. however, kaumann and
molenaar [13] have reported pk b values of 6.9–7.5 in rat
distal colon for sr59230a.

in our study, we also investigated the relaxation response to noradrenaline in the presence of  xxxd3000xxx . under these experimental conditions, noradrenaline can be
evaluated as a selective 1-adrenoceptor agonist. although metoprolol and ici-118551 were not found to be
able to antagonize noradrenaline responses in a competitive manner, sr59230a produced a concentration-dependent rightward shift of noradrenaline crc with a pa2
value of 7.9. the slope of schild plot of sr59230a against
noradrenaline was not different from unity, indicating a
competitive antagonism. from these findings, it can be
concluded that in rat gastric fundus the predominant adrenoceptor subtype responsible for noradrenaline-mediated relaxations is 3-adrenoceptor.
in the present study,  xxxd2098xxx  caused a marked relaxation with a low potency (5.5) in rat gastric fundus given
its known affinity (8.7) in rat uterine [6] at 2-adrenoceptor. interestingly,  xxxd2098xxx -induced relaxation could not
be antagonized by the maximum concentration of ici118551 (pkb = 6.1, 1 mol/l), but this response was inhibited by sr59230a (pkb = 7.7, 1 mol/l). our results reveal
that  xxxd2098xxx -induced relaxation in rat gastric fundus is
mainly due to activation of 3-adrenoceptors. similarly,
it has been shown that the relaxant responses to zinterol
in rat ileum [9] and to both  xxxd2098xxx  and terbutaline in
guinea-pig gastric fundus [26] are mediated by 3-adrenoceptor.
brl37344 produced a biphasic relaxation which was
resistant to antagonism by  xxxd2689xxx  (1 mol/l), indicating
another evidence for the presence of 3-adrenoceptor in
rat isolated gastric fundus. similar biphasic responses
were also obtained with zd7114, another selective 3-adrenoceptor agonist [27], and brl37344 [9] in rat ileum
precontracted with carbachol. kubota et al. [28] also
found that brl37344 caused biphasic crcs in rat urinary bladder contracted with carbachol but not kcl. in
addition, it has been shown that brl37344 causes monophasic relaxation responses in guinea-pig gastric fundus
precontracted with pgf2 [29]. the pd2 value calculated
in our study for the first component of brl37344 crc
(7.1) was consistent with the findings of growcott et al.
[27] (7.1), roberts et al. [9] (7.3) and kubota et al. [28]
(7.8). similar pd2 values for brl37344 were also calculated from monophasic responses in rabbit jejenum (7.4)
[11], rat distal colon (7.3) [12], and guinea-pig gastric fundus (7.4) [29] precontracted with agents different from
muscarinic agonists. on the other hand, the blocking
effect of sr59230a on brl37344 crc was found to
be phase-dependent. the maximum concentration of
sr59230a (1 mol/l) completely abolished the first phase

of brl37344 crc while no rightward shift was observed
at any concentration point of brl37344 crc in the second phase. our results suggest that brl37344 at high
concentrations (11 mol/l) causes relaxation by other
mechanism(s) different from -adrenoceptor activation.
indeed, kubota et al. [28] clearly showed that the second
component of brl37344-mediated relaxation response
in rat urinary bladder resulted from blockade of binding
of carbachol to muscarinic receptors.
in our study, the mrna transcripts of 1-, 2- and 3adrenoceptor were also detected in rat gastric fundus. surprisingly, the existence of 1- and 2-adrenoceptor mrna
transcripts was not reflected in the functional responses
in this tissue as mentioned above. this is consistent with
the findings of roberts et al. [9] who found that despite the
presence of 2-adrenoceptor mrna, selective 2-adrenoceptor agonist zinterol revealed its relaxing effect via the
3-adrenoceptor in rat ileum. one of the possible explanations for this discrepancy is that the mrna might not be
translated into functional receptors [9]. in addition, it may
also be the case that the receptors are expressed but subserve functions other than smooth muscle relaxation.
besides long-term complications of diabetes mellitus
such as neuropathy, cardiomyopathy, nephropathy and
retinopathy; gastrointestinal symptoms including gastric
dysrhythmias [30], antral dilation [31] and antral hypomotility [30] have been described in diabetic patients.
these pathophysiological events are referred to as ‘diabetic gastropathy’ [16]. one of the elements of diabetic
gastropathy is the failure of fundic relaxation [16].
a large body of evidence indicates that chronic diabetes causes a decrease in -adrenoceptor-mediated responses at different regions of gastrointestinal tract including duodenum, jejenum and ileum of experimental

diabetic rats [17]. it has been suggested that decreased
pd2 and/or emax values calculated in those studies reflect
a reduction in the number and/or affinity of -adrenoceptors. indeed, sakai et al. [18] showed that the decreased
relaxation response mediated by  xxxd2398xxx  was related
to the reduced number of -adrenoceptors in diabetic rat
gastric fundus. in their study, however, -adrenoceptors
were not differentiated according to their subtypes.
therefore, we also investigated the influence of diabetes
on relaxant responses and mrna levels of -adrenoceptor subtypes in the present study.
chronic diabetes caused a significant decrease in relaxation responses to  xxxd2398xxx  and noradrenaline
compared with the controls. in addition, diabetes reduced the first component of brl37344-induced relaxation response which seems to be responsible for 3-adrenoceptor activation. a decrease was also observed in
mrna levels encoding 3-adrenoceptor but not 1- and
2-adrenoceptor. although we did not measure 3-adrenoceptor protein levels directly, it can be suggested that
the decreased responsiveness of diabetic fundus to stimulation of -adrenoceptor agonists may be due to a decrease in expression of 3-adrenoceptors.
in summary, these results show that the functional adrenoceptor subtype involved in catecholamine-mediated relaxations in rat gastric fundus is 3-adrenoceptor,
and its function and mrna expression are decreased in
stz-induced diabetes.
