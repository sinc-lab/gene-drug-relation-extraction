characterization of the rat mesangial cell type 2 sulfonylurea
receptor.
background. sulfonylurea receptors are classified as either
high-affinity type 1 ( xxxg19xxx ) or low-affinity type 2 receptors
( xxxg20xxx ), and the gene expression of surs has recently been
demonstrated in kidney. however, functional data regarding
a renal sur are lacking. we previously demonstrated that
mesangial cell (mc) gene and protein expression of extracellular matrix components were up-regulated by the sulfonylurea,
 xxxd3392xxx . after noting this biological response, we next
sought to investigate the presence of a sulfonylurea receptor
in rat mcs.
methods. equilibrium binding studies employing [3h] xxxd2215xxx  as a ligand were performed on crude mc membrane
preparations. gene expression for sur was explored by northern analysis of cultured mcs and whole kidney tissue. the
effect of sulfonylurea on intracellular ca21 in mcs was assayed
by spectrofluorometry, and  xxxd2215xxx -induced changes in
the contractility of mcs were assessed.
results. mcs bound [3h] xxxd2215xxx  with a kd of 2.6 mm
and a bmax of 30.4 pmol/mg protein as determined by scatchard
analysis. three  xxxg20xxx  transcripts were detected in mcs. a
major transcript was detected at 5.5 kb and minor transcripts
 xxxd2274xxx .5 and 8.6 kb. following sulfonylurea treatment of mcs,
real-time videomicroscopy revealed intense mc contraction,
coinciding with oscillatory increments of intracellular ca21 concentration. further evidence of sulfonylurea-induced mc contraction was demonstrated by  xxxd2215xxx -induced deformation of a silicone rubber substrate.
conclusions. these results demonstrate that  xxxg20xxx  resides
on mcs. functional activation of this receptor by sulfonylurea
induces ca21 transients that result in mc contraction.

sulfonylurea compounds, commonly used in the treatment of non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus [1, 2],
exert an antihyperglycemic effect primarily by acting on
key words:  xxxd3392xxx ,  xxxd2215xxx , mesangial cell contraction, noninsulin dependent diabetes, glucose uptake, hypoglycemia.

pancreatic b cells as insulin secretagogues [3]. however,
in some extrapancreatic tissues, including hepatocytes,
myocytes, and adipocytes, sulfonylureas directly augment glucose uptake [4–6]. these effects and those in b
cells are mediated by specific receptors that bind sulfonylurea compounds, such as  xxxd2215xxx  and  xxxd3392xxx . high- and low-affinity sulfonylurea receptors have
been identified and are classified, respectively, as  xxxg19xxx 
and  xxxg20xxx  [3, 7, 8].  xxxg19xxx  has been localized to cardiac,
neuronal and smooth muscle tissues, brain microsomes,
and pancreatic b cells.
surs also bind the nonsulfonylurea hypoglycemic
agents, linogliride and meglitinide, and several k1-channel openers, including  xxxd1868xxx , minoxidil, nicorandil,
pinacidil, and cromakalim [9–12]. recently, naturally occurring ligands for sur, termed endosulfines a and b,
have been chromatographically isolated and purified
from ovine and porcine brain [13, 14]. the a isoform
is structurally related to the porcine camp-regulated
phosphoprotein. however, the function of endosulfines
remains speculative.
 xxxg19xxx  has been cloned recently, and its primary structure and membrane topology place it among members
of the  xxxd83xxx  (atp)-binding cassette
transporter/channel superfamily [15]. this diverse group
of transporters totals more than 100 members. included
among these are the human p-glycoprotein (p-gp), which
confers multiple resistance to chemotherapeutic agents,
pgh1, which accords chloroquine resistance to malariatransmitting falciparum species, and  xxxg437xxx  (cftr) [16]. all abc
transporters have two cytosolic nucleotide (atp/adp)binding and multiple transmembrane-spanning domains.
the entire complex confers substrate specificity to atpregulated solute transport. dissimilar to other abc
transport proteins, cftr is an ion channel, thus broadening the scope of the  xxxg22xxx  family.
the atp-sensitive sulfonylurea-sensitive k1 channels
(katp) in smooth muscle are comprised of two subunits.

2289

asano et al: rat mesangial  xxxg20xxx 

these are the regulatory subunit sur and the poreforming subunit that derives from the kir inward rectifier
gene family. increasing the cellular atp/adp ratio or
exposure to sulfonylurea inactivates katp channels,
thereby decreasing potassium efflux. engagement of
 xxxg19xxx  by sulfonylureas on pancreatic b cells induces
membrane depolarization and transiently augments ca21
influx through l-type calcium channels and accelerates
insulin secretion [17–20]. inadvertent interactions of normal pancreatic  xxxg19xxx  with compounds structurally related to sulfonylurea compounds, such as sulfonamide
antibiotics, have resulted in “therapeutic misadventure”
with serious episodes of hypoglycemia [3]. moreover,
mutations of the  xxxg19xxx  gene locus have been predictably
associated with disorders of glucose homeostasis, including persistent hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia [21–23].
the rat sur isoform  xxxg20xxx  is highly expressed in
skeletal muscle and heart [24]. the murine isoform,
sur2a, is exclusively expressed by the heart, whereas
the more ubiquitous sur2b has been localized to skeletal and intestinal smooth muscle, as well as neuronal
tissue. not surprisingly, the intrinsic functions of these
tissues, that is, force generation, peristalsis, and impulse
conduction, are coupled to their resting membrane electropotentials [17, 25]. to date, renal  xxxg1253xxx  activity
has been documented by ho et al and wang [26, 27],
and  xxxg20xxx  gene and protein expression in whole mouse
kidney has been demonstrated by chutkow et al [24]. we
have recently observed that the sulfonylurea compound
 xxxd3392xxx  enhances cytochalasin b-inhibitable 2-deoxyglucose uptake by mesangial cells (mcs) and gives rise
to marked alterations of extracellular matrix metabolism
[28]. collectively, these data suggest that these metabolic
effects of sulfonylurea may be mediated by a sur residing on the mc surface. to explore this hypothesis, we
initiated a series of experiments to characterize the putative mc sur.
methods
reagents
rpmi 1640 medium and rna markers were purchased from life technologies (gaithersburg, md,
usa). nu-serum and insulin-transferrin-selenium (its)
were obtained from becton dickinson (bedford, ma,
usa).  xxxd2215xxx , dimethylpolysiloxane, antibiotics,
morpholino-(propane)-sulfonic acid (mops) buffer, and
mops-ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (edta)-sodium acetate (mesa) buffer were purchased from sigma
co. (st. louis, mo, usa). [3h] xxxd2215xxx  (50 ci/
mmol) and [a-32p]dctp (3000 ci/mmol) were purchased
from dupont nen (boston, ma, usa). bicinchoninic
acid proteins assay kits were obtained from pierce
(rockford, il, usa). random oligomer priming kits
were obtained from boehringer mannheim (indianapo-

lis, in, usa). rat  xxxg20xxx  cdna (pjgar7) was a generous gift of dr. c. burant (university of chicago, chicago,
il, usa) [24]. quikhyb solution was obtained from
stratagene (la jolla, ca, usa). fura-2 am was obtained from molecular probes (eugene, or, usa). nytran membranes were purchased from schleicher &
schuell (keene, nh, usa).
tissue culture
the mcs used for all studies are from the previously
characterized rat cell line 16kc2, originally cloned from
glomerular explants of fischer rat glomeruli [28–30].
these spindle-shaped cells form hillocks in nonconfluent
tissue cultures and do not exhibit dome formation. the
cells stain positively for vimentin, desmin, and a-smooth
muscle actin, but not for cytokeratin or factor viii. cellular contraction occurs following exposure to either  xxxg99xxx  or  xxxd3495xxx . these cells also bear
anp receptors on their surfaces as well as the thy-1
antigen. the sv40-transformed hamster insulinoma tumor b cell line (hit) was obtained from the american
type culture collection (cat. no. crl-1777; rockville,
ma, usa) [31]. hit cells have  xxxg19xxx  receptors and
exhibit atp-sensitive k1 channel activity following their
exposure to sulfonylurea at nanomolar concentrations
[3, 9]. the fibroblast rna used in northern analysis
was obtained from sjl mouse cortical tubulointerstitial
fibroblasts (tfbs), as previously described by alvarez
et al [32, 33]. except where noted, mcs were seeded at
a density of 1.5 3 105 cells per 150 mm diameter culture
dish and were then grown for seven days to near confluence in rpmi 1640 medium containing 8 mm glucose,
20% nu-serum, and antibiotics (100 u/ml penicillin and
100 mg/ml streptomycin). the culture medium was
changed at two- or three-day intervals. hit cells and
tfb cells were passaged weekly and cultured in a similar
medium, except that they contained 10% fetal calf serum
(fcs) instead of nu-serum, as previously described [7].
cell membrane preparation
cells were scraped into an ice-cold homogenizing
buffer (ph 7.4) containing 20 mm hepes, 2 mm edta,
250 mm sucrose, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride
(pmsf), 1 mm pepstatin, and 1 mm leupeptin. cells were
immediately homogenized by 20 strokes in a glass
dounce with a matched teflon pestle. the homogenate
was centrifuged for 10 minutes at 760 g. the supernatant
was pooled and centrifuged at 100,000 g for 60 minutes
in a beckman model l5-65 ultracentrifuge (beckman
instruments, palo alto, ca, usa). the pelleted crude
membrane preparation was resuspended in a buffer containing 20 mm mops and 0.1 mm pmsf, ph 7.4, and
was aliquoted and stored at 2708c in preparation for
binding studies. prior to binding studies, the membrane
preparation was briefly rehomogenized, and the mem-

asano et al: rat mesangial  xxxg20xxx 

brane protein concentration was assayed by the bicinchoninic acid method, using bovine  xxxg124xxx 
(bsa) as the standard.
equilibrium binding assays
for high-affinity sur receptor-binding studies, 200
mg protein fractions of cell membranes were incubated
with [3h] xxxd2215xxx  (specific activity, 50 mci/nmol).
incubation mixtures contained final concentrations of 0
to 10 nm [3h] xxxd2215xxx , 50 mm mops, and 0.1 mm
pmsf (ph 7.4). incubations were carried out at 258c
for 60 minutes before their rapid termination by filtration
through whatman gf/f filters and immediate washing
two times with 4 ml of chilled 80 mm mops (ph 7.4)
containing 1% bsa. filtration and washing were completed within 10 seconds. the amount of radioactivity
retained by filters was determined by liquid scintillation
counting in a beckman model ls 3801 counter. for
the high-affinity sur receptor, nonspecific binding was
determined by adding 1 mm nonradioactive  xxxd2215xxx  to the incubation solution. for the low-affinity receptor, 500 mg of cell membrane samples and 0 to 4 mm
[3h] xxxd2215xxx  (specific activity, 2 mci/nmol) were
used, and all other steps were carried out as described
earlier here. in this case, nonspecific binding was determined by adding 400 mm of nonradiolabeled  xxxd2215xxx  to the incubation solution. the low solubility of  xxxd2215xxx  precluded the use of higher concentrations
to determine nonspecific binding. scatchard analysis of
the data was performed with commercial software (prism
vs. 2.0.3; graphpad, san diego, ca, usa).
northern analysis
total rna was extracted from fischer rat (charles
river labs, long island, ny, usa) brain, heart, and
kidney. organs were immediately snap frozen in liquid
n2, pulverized to powder in a liquid n2-cooled mortar,
and homogenized in rna stat-60 (tel-test, friendswood, tx, usa). rnas were then extracted with a
modified guanidinium thiocyanate method [33, 34]. cultures of mcs and tfbs were washed twice with ice-cold
hank’s buffered saline solution prior to rna extraction.
experimental and control rna species were vacuum
dried and denatured at 708c in 2 3 mesa buffer containing 2.4 m formaldehyde, 15% formamide, 0.8 mg/
ml ethidium bromide, and 10 mm edta. rnas were
fractionated on 1% agarose gels containing 1 3 mesa
and 0.4 m formaldehyde. rna species were transferred
by downward capillary action to nytran membranes. a
4.1 kbp eco ri restriction fragment of the rat  xxxg20xxx 
cdna was radiolabeled in the presence of [a-32p]dctp
by the random oligomer priming method [32]. membranes were prehybridized at 688c for 20 minutes in
quikhyb solution. hybridization was carried out at 688c
for 14 hours (1 3 106 cpm/ml). membranes were then

2291

washed twice in 2 3 ssc ( xxxd3213xxx  sodium citrate: 0.3 m  xxxd3213xxx  and 0.03 m sodium citrate)
containing 0.1%  xxxd3215xxx  for 15 minutes
at 258c and once in 0.1 3 ssc containing 0.1% sodium
 xxxd3215xxx  for 30 minutes at 608c. autoradiography
with intensifying screens was carried out for 16 to 72
hours at 2708c.
spectrofluorometric measurement of ca21
mesangial cells were plated on cover slips and cultured
for three to four days until a confluence of 60 to 70%
was achieved. a 10 mm solution of fura-2 am dye in
dimethylsulfoxide (dmso) was added to a perfusion
solution containing 120 mm nacl, 5 mm kcl, 25 mm
nahco3, 2 mm na2hpo4, 1.2 mm  xxxd2534xxx , 2.5 mm cacl2,
8 mm glucose, and 1% fcs, ph 7.4. mcs were loaded
with dye and then placed in an environment of 95% air
and 5% co2 for 60 minutes at 378c. after incubation,
cover slips were placed for 20 minutes in a temperatureregulated chamber and mounted on a diaphot-tmd
inverted microscope (nikon, tokyo, japan) that was
continuously irrigated with the perfusion solution at 1 ml/
min. the intensity of fluorescence was measured during
alternating excitations of the fluor at 340 and 380 nm
wavelengths. fluorescent images were filtered by a highpass 510 nm filter, and measurements were conducted
at 20-second intervals. autofluorescence of cells was negligible. fluorescence was digitally acquired with an image
intensifier at a magnification of 3100 (video scope international, herndon, va, usa) and a ccd camera
(hamamatsu, hamamatsu city, japan). digitized images of the spectrofluorometric ratio a340/380 were analyzed by the image one metafluor system (universal
imaging, west chester, pa, usa). after three control
measurements, 10 mm of  xxxd2215xxx  in dmso was
added to the perfusion solution to achieve a final concentration of 3 mm within five minutes. an increase in the
fluorescence ratio a340/380 signified an increase of the intracellular ca21 concentration [35, 36].
silicon membrane preparation
a thin silicon rubber substratum for cell contraction
experiments was prepared using a modification of the
protocol of harris, wild, and stopak [37]. one hundred
microliters of dimethylpolysiloxane (60,000 cs) were applied as a thin layer to the surface of round glass cover
slips (18 mm diameter). grid markings were engraved
on these coverslips to assist in the identification and
location of cultured mcs. to polymerize the substrate,
the dish was placed in a hummer v sputter coater chamber (technics inc., baltimore, md, usa), 4 cm from a
gold-palladium target [38, 39]. air was evacuated from
the chamber by gradual application of vacuum to 0.1
torr. the vacuum was continued at this level until air
bubbles were no longer present on the surface of the

2292

asano et al: rat mesangial  xxxg20xxx 

substrate. next, the sputter coating chamber was flushed
with argon gas until a pressure of 0.2 torr was achieved.
a vacuum was gradually reapplied until the pressure
declined to 0.1 torr, and this sequence was repeated a
total of three times. argon plasma was produced by the
introduction of gas into the chamber during application
of a steady 20 ma current for 16 to 20 seconds.
mesangial cell contraction
mesangial cells were grown on the coated coverslips
described earlier at a density of 2 3 104 cells/cm2 in rpmi
1640 containing 20% nu-serum for two days. twentyfour hours before experiments, the culture media were
replaced with rpmi 1640 containing 0.1% fcs and an
its culture supplement to provide per liter the following:
6.3 mg insulin, 6.3 mg transferrin, 6.3 mg selenious acid,
1.3 g bovine  xxxg124xxx , 5.4 mg linoleic acid. prior
to the experiments, cells were incubated for 60 minutes
in a perfusion solution similar to that used during intracellular ca21 measurements, but containing 0.1% fcs.
for experiments, coverslips were placed in a temperature-regulated observation chamber and observed with
a hoffman contrast-modulation optical system. images
were obtained at a magnification of 3100 with a ccd
camera and a videocassette recorder (sony corp.,
tokyo, japan). the temperature and ph of the perfusion
solution were 37.0 6 0.58c and 7.45 6 0.05, respectively.
in eight independent experiments, 30 to 50 cells per
experiment were located for observation with help of
the coverslip grid markings. the perfusion solution in
the chamber was then replaced with the same solution,
but containing 5 mm  xxxd2215xxx  or the vehicle used
for its dissolution (dmso). after 20 minutes, images of
the same cells were recorded again. a change in the
cell contractile force was determined by an increase or
decrease in the number of wrinkles surrounding each
cell. each cell was then classified as having either “contracted,” “no change,” or “relaxed” from its original
morphology, according to the appearance of wrinkles
in the neighboring substratum. in addition, during the
experimental period some cells underwent detachment.
differences between the numbers of cells classified in
each category, before and after exposure to  xxxd2215xxx  or its vehicle, were analyzed by a two-tailed unpaired
t-test. comparisons were considered significant at the
level of p , 0.05.

cell line (hit) cell sulfonylurea receptor. two hundred micrograms of
hit and mesangial cell (mc) membrane proteins were incubated at
258c for 60 minutes with increasing amounts of [3h] xxxd2215xxx  at a
constant specific activity of 50 mci/nmol during equilibrium radioligand
binding studies. the results of a representative experiment are shown
(n 5 2). specific binding of ligand (s) was calculated following the
subtraction of nonspecific binding (m) from total binding (d). specific
saturable binding of  xxxd2215xxx  to hit cell membranes is depicted
(a) with a scatchard plot of the binding data (inset). nonspecific binding
to mc membranes (b) is evident over the concentration range shown
(n 5 2). however, no specific binding (s) to mc membranes is demonstrated.

results
identification of sulfonylurea receptors
to determine whether sulfonylurea receptors were
present on mcs, we performed equilibrium binding studies on crude membrane preparations. using pancreatic
hit cells as a positive control, we first validated our
methodology by demonstrating the binding of [3h] xxxd2215xxx -

clamide to hit membranes (n 5 2). at nanomolar concentrations of sulfonylurea, specific and saturable binding of the radioligand to hit membranes was documented over the concentration range of 0 to 10 nm (fig.
1a). scatchard analysis of these data established an apparent kd of 0.65 nm and bmax of 0.65 pmol/mg protein,

asano et al: rat mesangial  xxxg20xxx 

fig. 2. identification of a low-affinity mesangial cell sulfonylurea receptor. five hundred microgram samples of mc membrane proteins were
used for binding studies, using increasing concentrations of  xxxd2215xxx  according to the methodology described in figure 1, except that
the specific activity of the sulfonylurea was 2 mci/nmol. total binding
(d), nonspecific binding (m), and specific saturable binding (s) of
[3h] xxxd2215xxx  to mc membranes are shown. a scatchard plot of
the binding data and apparent values for binding parameters are shown
(inset). each data point represents the pooled results obtained in four
independent experiments. in each experiment, samples were tested in
duplicate. values are expressed as means 6 se. except for the lowest
amount tested (0.2 mm), differences between specific and nonspecific
binding are statistically significant (p , 0.05) at all concentrations.

values consonant with those previously reported for
high-affinity sur receptors (fig. 1a, inset). to establish
the presence of a high-affinity sur in mcs, we performed similar binding studies on mc membranes. however, in contradistinction to our hit cell results, there
was no specific or saturable binding of radioligand to
mc membranes at the nanomolar concentrations tested
(fig. 1b). to determine whether a low-affinity sur receptor resided on mcs, we subsequently increased final
 xxxd2215xxx  concentrations to 0.2 to 4.0 mm. apparent
equilibrium binding was attained within 30 minutes of
incubation and did not change afterward (unpublished
data). in four independent experiments in which samples
were tested in duplicate, we demonstrated specific binding of  xxxd2215xxx  to mc membranes (fig. 2). the

quantities of total rnas extracted from rat mcs, brain, heart, and
kidney and mouse kidney fibroblasts were probed with rat  xxxg20xxx  cdna
(a). in brain, heart, and kidney, hybridization  xxxd2274xxx .5 kb was detected
after 16 hours of autoradiography. in mcs, a major transcript appeared
at 5.5 kb and a minor transcript at 8.6 kb.  xxxg20xxx  transcripts were not
detected in renal fibroblasts. in a separate experiment (b), after 72
hours of autoradiographic exposure, we reproducibly hybridized three
mesangial transcripts at 5.5, 7.5, and 8.6 kb with the rat  xxxg20xxx  cdna
used in (a).

scatchard analysis of binding data yielded an apparent
kd of 2.6 mm and a bmax of 30.4 pmol/mg protein (fig.
2, inset).
 xxxg20xxx  gene expression
to determine whether the  xxxg20xxx  gene was expressed
by rat mcs and whether this receptor was homologous
to that previously described in extrapancreatic tissues,
we probed total rnas extracted from cultured mcs and
rat brain, heart, and kidney. in northern analysis, we
probed for the  xxxg20xxx  message with a 4.1 kbp eco ri
fragment of the rat  xxxg20xxx  cdna. under high-stringency
conditions, we demonstrated hybridization to a 7.5 kb
transcript from whole brain and kidney, after autoradiography for 16 hours (fig. 3a). however, this hybridization
signal was much stronger in cardiac tissue. in total rna
from mcs, a signal equal in intensity to that of the heart
7.5 kb transcript was apparent at 5.5 kb, and a fainter

fig. 4.  xxxd2215xxx -induced ca21 transients in mesangial cells. the changes in the
mesangial cell fluorescence ratio a340/380 over
a 15-minute time course are shown. following
loading of subconfluent mesangial cell cultures with fura-2 dye, cells were incubated at
378c in an incubation/observation chamber
irrigated by a perfusion solution containing
1% fcs. a representative experiment is
shown in which three cells were marked, and
then spectrofluorometric measurements were
obtained after the addition of  xxxd2215xxx 
to the perfusion reservoir at t 5 25 minutes.
at t 5 22.5 minutes, small initial spikes representing increases in ca21 concentration were
demonstrated in all three cells, as  xxxd2215xxx  entered the incubation/observation chamber.  xxxd2215xxx  concentration in the
chamber’s incubation solution reached a maximum 2.5 minutes later at t 5 0 min (arrow).
ca21 transients in all observed cells oscillated
synchronously at two- to three-minute intervals following exposure to  xxxd2215xxx  until
the end of the observation period.

signal was detected at 8.6 kb. in addition, because fibroblasts share phenotypic similarities to activated mcs, we
attempted to discern if there was  xxxg20xxx  gene expression
by tfb.  xxxg20xxx  transcripts were undetectable from these
renal fibroblasts, despite probing up to 40 mg of total
rna [32, 33]. following 72 hours of autoradiography,
we reproducibly detected two minor transcripts  xxxd2274xxx .5
and 8.6 kb in replicate studies (fig. 3b).
 xxxd2215xxx -induced elevation of intracellular ca21
because cell depolarization is associated with sur
receptor binding and this results in the generation of
intracellular ca21 ion transients in pancreatic b cells,
we hypothesized that exposure of mcs to sulfonylurea
would induce alterations of their intracellular ca21 levels. to explore this issue, we treated fura 2-loaded mcs
with either a therapeutically relevant concentration of
 xxxd2215xxx  (3 mm) or the vehicle used to dissolve it
and then continuously monitored their respective fluorescence ratios (a340/380) in a perfusion/observation
chamber over a period of 15 minutes.  xxxd2215xxx ,
incorporated into the perfusate’s reservoir, reached the
perfusion/observation chamber within 2.5 minutes,
achieving its maximum concentration of 3 mm 2.5 minutes
later. coincident with the initial appearance of  xxxd2215xxx  in the observation chamber, oscillations in the
ca21 concentration were apparent (fig. 4). as  xxxd2215xxx  reached its final maximal concentration of 3 mm,
intracellular ca21 concentrations markedly increased simultaneously in all cells under observation (fig. 4).
these elevations returned to baseline after approximately 60 seconds. thereafter, oscillatory elevations of
intracellular ca21, as indicated by an increase in their

respective fluorescence ratios, occurred at two- to threeminute intervals, the magnitude of elevation varying
among cells. notably, changes in intracellular ca21 were
frequently accompanied by alterations of cell morphology due to cell contraction (unpublished data). in some
instances, the cells contracted with sufficient force to
cause their total detachment from the coverslip.
mesangial cell contraction
to demonstrate further that mc contraction was attributable to ca21 elevations mediated through sulfonylurea stimulation, we assessed the tensile forces generated
by cells cultured on the silicon rubber substrate. in these
cultures, tensile forces generated at points of mc adhesion are visually evident as a series of wrinkles in the
elastic substrate. exposure of mcs to  xxxd2215xxx  at
a final concentration of 5 mm resulted in cell contraction,
evident as “new” wrinkle formations (fig. 5), in a significant number of cells, as compared with vehicle-treated
cells in which only infrequent spontaneous contractions
were detected (39 vs. 6%; fig. 6). in addition, a significant
number of cells underwent detachment in the presence
of  xxxd2215xxx  (fig. 6). as previously observed during
the intracellular ca21 studies, this detachment is likely
related to the generation of large increments in  xxxd3100xxx 
forces by some cells. only a few cells in either vehicle- or
 xxxd2215xxx -treated groups demonstrated relaxation
from their baseline states.
discussion
these studies represent the initial demonstration of a
functional sulfonylurea receptor in mcs. we have shown

concentrations typical for those of lower affinity surs
[3, 8]. the binding kinetics imply that receptor binding
may occur at the micromolar concentrations that may
be encountered during therapeutic administration of sulfonylurea compounds [40]. in this study, gene expression
of the putative mesangial  xxxg20xxx  was constitutive, and
highly abundant levels of a 5.5 kb transcript were detected by northern blotting. in addition, the functionality
of this mesangial  xxxg20xxx  is exemplified by the oscillatory
ca21 transients and intense cell contraction that occur
following the exposure of mcs to  xxxd2215xxx .

the detection of competitive binding of sulfonylurea
agents to membrane preparations from various tissues
has been used extensively to demonstrate and characterize the presence of sur receptors in these tissues.  xxxg19xxx 
receptor is a high-affinity 140 kda receptor with kd of
0.05 to 1.0 nm.  xxxg20xxx  is a 170 kda receptor with an
apparent kd of 0.6 mm for  xxxd2215xxx  [7, 8]. northern
analysis of rat tissues has documented constitutive expression of a 7.5 kb  xxxg20xxx  transcript in heart, skeletal
muscle, kidney, brain, and testis [24]. in addition, a  xxxg20xxx 
isoform has more recently been localized in rat brain by
inagaki et al [8]. the 5.5 kb transcript detected in our
studies has not been previously described in rat, although
a homologue may exist in human skeletal muscle that
expresses transcripts of 5.6, 8.6, and 9.4 kb [24]. our
results suggest that the rat mesangial  xxxg20xxx  represents
an alternatively spliced variant of  xxxg20xxx  that has not
been previously described in kidney. the differential
gene expression of the mesangial 5.5 kb transcript, in
comparison to those found in whole rat kidney, insinuates that there is differential gene regulation of  xxxg20xxx 
among different nephronal compartments.
characteristically, ligation of sulfonylureas by their
receptors closes katp channels [3, 8, 12]. by contrast,
members of this channel family are activated by  xxxg1232xxx  openers such as  xxxd1868xxx  and pinacidil
that are operative at a locus distinct from the binding
site of sulfonylureas [9, 10]. physiologically, katp channels are reversibly inhibited by increasing cellular energetics, that is, elevated intracellular (atp/adp) ratio.
therefore, channel activation and ion transport are functionally linked to cellular metabolism. currently, surs
and kir6.0-type k1 channels, respectively, comprise the
regulatory and ion pore permeation subunits of a structurally and functionally engaged hetero-octameric katp
complex ( xxxg1250xxx :sur)4 [41, 42]. evidence for a func-

2296

asano et al: rat mesangial  xxxg20xxx 

tional interaction between kir and sur is found in studies involving  xxxg1250xxx  where c-terminus truncation mutants exhibit atp sensitivity, but neither sulfonylurea
( xxxd3394xxx ) nor  xxxd1868xxx  sensitivity in the absence
of  xxxg19xxx  coexpression [43]. furthermore, inagaki et al
generated a  xxxd2215xxx -inhibitable potassium current
in cv-1 origin of sv40 (cos) cells, presumably following generation of  xxxg1253xxx  activity (ki 5 1.8 nm)
after functional coexpression of  xxxg1250xxx  and  xxxg19xxx  [43].
moreover, the authors also noted the presence of distinctive  xxxg1253xxx  activity following reconstitution of
 xxxg1250xxx  and sur2a [8].
multiple k1 channels have been described in the kidney. among these are the  xxxg1249xxx / xxxg1249xxx  channels found
in the distal nephron [44]. however, dissimilar to classic
katp channels, the  xxxg1249xxx  channel subfamily does not
exhibit atp sensitivity. interestingly, ämmälä et al conferred sulfonylurea sensitivity to hek 293 cells by coupling  xxxg19xxx  to either  xxxg1249xxx  or kir6.1, with a consequent
blockade of whole-cell currents following exposure to
 xxxd2215xxx , implying the promiscuous nature of such
receptor–channel associations [11]. in addition, sur2b
may also form an atp-regulated, sulfonylurea-inhibitable complex after cotransfection with kir6.1 [43]. although the notion that mesangial  xxxg20xxx  is functionally
coupled to an inwardly rectifying k1 channel may be
extrapolated from our results, the exact nature of such
a channel in mcs remains speculative.
the influx of ca21, perhaps through opening of voltage-gated l-type channels, is coupled to cell contraction
in our studies. however, the cytosolic ca21 elevations
may not solely originate from entry of extracellular ca21
but may also derive from intracellular or nucleoplasmic
stores [36, 45–49]. this speculation may be particularly
relevant because sulfonylurea binding to an intracellular
membranous component has been demonstrated, in addition to its known plasma membrane binding [3]. oscillations of intracellular ca21 similar to those recorded
in our experiments have been previously confirmed in
hepatocytes, pancreatic cells, myocytes, and mcs [50–
53]. in the latter, the frequency of such transients has
been diminished by  xxxd3495xxx  administration
and augmented via  xxxd2925xxx -induced protein kinase
c activation [53]. aside from their obvious effects on
intracellular ca21, the exact mechanisms through which
sulfonylureas induce their functional and metabolic effects on mcs remain unclear. it has been surmised that
the modulation of  xxxg1253xxx  activity occurs by alternation of key phosphorylation/dephosphorylation sites
on inwardly rectifying k1 channels [44, 54].
in the aggregate, we have demonstrated the presence
of a membrane-associated sulfonylurea-binding protein
in which the binding characteristics parallel those of the
 xxxg20xxx  subclass of abc channel/transporters. ligation
of mesangial  xxxg20xxx  by  xxxd2215xxx  mediates cell con-

traction via elevations of intracellular ca21. the importance of this newly described receptor and its pathophysiological relevance will require further studies to elucidate whether surs participate in other mc functions,
including regulation of extracellular matrix metabolism.
nevertheless, it is intriguing to speculate the role that
sulfonylureas might play in diabetic renal disease,
wherein glomerular hyperfunction has been considered
a significant contributor to the development of glomerulosclerosis. because this hyperfunction is attributed, in
part, to diminished mesangial contractility, the restoration and normalization of mc contractility by sulfonylureas may exert a salutary effect on glomerular injury
[55]. the question of whether the summation of metabolic and functional consequences of sulfonylurea administration is beneficial or deleterious in the evolution
of diabetic renal disease represents an appealing avenue
of future inquiry.
