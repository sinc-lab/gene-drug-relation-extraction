abstract: n-sulfonylated and n-alkylated  xxxd446xxx  derivatives were
investigated for their inhibition and modulation of gamma-secretase, which
is associated with alzheimer‚Äôs disease. the introduction of a lipophilic
substituent transformed the cox-2 inhibitor  xxxd446xxx  into a potent
gamma-secretase modulator. several compounds (e.g., 9p, 11f) caused
selective reduction of abeta42 and an increase of abeta38. the most active
compounds displayed activities in the low micromolar range and no
effect on the gamma-secretase cleavage at the -site.

despite tremendous progress in understanding alzheimer‚Äôs
disease (ad), there remains the challenge to develop agents
for its therapy. approved drugs such as acetylcholinesterase
inhibitors and memantine hydrochloride offer symptomatic
treatment, but they do not address the basic pathology of the
disease: deposition of amyloid plaques and development of
neurofibrillary tangles. the metabolism of the beta-amyloid
precursor protein (app), which is cleaved by the aspartic
proteases  xxxg241xxx  and gamma-secretase, results in the generation
and pathological deposition of the 40 and 42 amino acid long
peptides abeta40 and abeta42 (figure 1). these fragments are the
major components of amyloid fibrils.1,2
promising results for the treatment of ad were obtained with
some  xxxg1883xxx  (cox-1) inhibitors,3-7 both in vitro and
in a prospective, population-based cohort study of 6989
patients.8 this is not a class effect because nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (nsaids) (e.g., diclofenac (2-[2-(2,6dichlorophenyl)aminophenyl]ethanoic acid) and naproxen ((+)(s)- xxxd2700xxx )) do not lower
 xxxg178xxx  in vitro,3,5 and neither naproxen nor rofecoxib (4-(4methylsulfonylphenyl)-3-phenyl-5h-furan-2-one, a cox-2 inhibitor) slows cognitive decline in patients with mild-tomoderate ad.9,10 the positive clinical results are still in need
of a sound rationale and experimental validation.11 the proof
of concept is still missing. nsaids that modulate gamma-secretase
cleavage of app affect the distance between app and presenilin
1, the catalytic subunit of gamma-secretase.12 they seem to interfere
with substrate recognition/cleavage and shift the precision of
gamma-secretase cleavage from the gamma42 to the gamma38 site (figure 1) to
generate more abeta38 and less abeta42.3,12 compounds with reverse
shift were reported recently, and these enhanced abeta42 produc* to whom correspondence should be addressed. phone: (+49) 6151163075. fax: (+49) 6151-163278. e-mail: schmidt_boris@t-online.de.

modulation of gamma-secretase cleavage by nsaids. (a) app is first
processed by  xxxg241xxx  to generate the c-terminal fragment ctfbeta,
which is subsequently cleaved within its transmembrane domain at two
principle sites, gamma and , by gamma-secretase to release  xxxg178xxx  and aicd. (b)
heterogeneous cleavage at the gamma-site generates different  xxxg178xxx  species
by cleavage at the gamma38, gamma40, and gamma42 sites. a subset of nsaids
increases the cleavage at the gamma38 site while reducing cleavage at the
gamma42 site.

reductions in abeta1-40 and abeta1-42 plasma levels but was found
to be toxic. it produced small reductions in abeta1-40 in the cortex
at 25 mg kg-1 d-1 but did not affect  xxxg178xxx  levels in the
hippocampus or cerebrospinal fluid. cyclopropylated  xxxd2141xxx  analogues without cox activity display improved potency
on gamma-secretase inhibition.14 contrary to previous reports,  xxxd3259xxx 
sulfide (2-((5z)-1-(4-(methylthio)benzylidene)-5-fluoro-2-methyl-1h-inden-3-yl)acetic acid, 2) and ibuprofen (2-(4-isobutylphenyl) xxxd3029xxx , 4) were found to be neither toxic nor
efficacious at doses up to 50 mg kg-1 d-1.15 the kinetics of
 xxxg178xxx  formation in the presence of the two nsaids and the
displacement of an active site directed inhibitor support allosteric, noncompetitive modes of action of  xxxd3260xxx  (2)6
and r- xxxd2141xxx  (1, scheme 1) at low concentrations.7 this
resulted in selective inhibition of abeta42 production. however,
both nsaids shift their modes of action from modulation to
complete, nonselective inhibition of gamma-secretase at high concentrations. unfortunately, nsaid derivatives have escaped
photoaffinity labeling techniques so far, except for biotinylated
 xxxd2096xxx  which labelled the c-terminal fragment of app.16

scheme 3a

in summary, just a few nsaids (1-4, scheme 1) were
reported to modulate gamma-secretase, and an even smaller number
of nsaids display confirmed modulation at physiological
concentrations. despite these vague, sometimes contradictory
results reported for nsaid activity, we and others13,17 were
encouraged to investigate nsaids as scaffolds for gamma-secretase
inhibitors. we commenced with the derivatization of the
carboxylic acid common to the cox-1 inhibitors. furthermore,
we included cox-2 inhibitors that are different from the coxib
class such as  xxxd446xxx  ((()-2-(3-chloro-9h-carbazol-7-yl) xxxd3029xxx , 6) and  xxxd2065xxx  ( xxxd2065xxx ) because they are
structurally closer to cox-1 than to cox-2 inhibitors. although
some of the esters and amides displayed moderate inhibition of
the cleavage by gamma-secretase (abeta38, abeta40, abeta42), this approach
was soon abandoned. few of these initial derivatives displayed
increased, unselective inhibition of gamma-secretase in comparison
to their parent drugs. most of the approximately 150 nsaid
carboxylic acid derivatives (e.g., 7) resulted in loss of activity.
this indicated an important contribution of the carboxylic acid
to target affinity. after a brief investigation of  xxxd3259xxx 
analogues we focused on  xxxd446xxx , which is a cox-2 inhibitor
approved for the use in dogs, cows, and horses. the selectivity
of  xxxd446xxx  versus cox-2canine and cox-1canine is greater than
100:1 (cox-2canine ic50: r/s- xxxd446xxx  102 nm, r- xxxd446xxx 
5.97 ¬µm, s- xxxd446xxx  37 nm).18 original  xxxd446xxx  (as isolated
from 500 mg tablets) was found to be a weak inhibitor of
gamma-secretase and reduced abeta38, abeta40, and abeta42 at high concentration (figure 2). this corresponds to the activity of r-methylated  xxxd446xxx , which was reported to inhibit abeta42 production
by 40% at 100 ¬µm.17 this is in contrast to the inverse
modulation of the cox-2 inhibitors that was reported recently.13
the readily accessible sulfonamides were inspired by the
gamma-secretase inhibitor 5 (bms-299897) and supported by a recent
series from merck sharp & dohme.19,20 an analogue series of
 xxxd446xxx  n-sulfonamides was prepared as outlined in scheme
2. the acid functionality of  xxxd446xxx  was protected as a benzyl
ester 7. n-sulfonylation of 7 was carried out using nah and a
sulfonyl chloride in thf. the benzyl group of 8 was removed
by hydrogenation (8a-m,p-r) or base hydrolysis (8n-o,s) to
give the acid 9. we expected these compounds to be inhibitors
of gamma-secretase activity because of their resemblance to the
gamma-secretase inhibitor 5. serendipitously, they turned out to be
modulators of gamma-secretase activity, which control the cleavage
pattern of gamma-secretase. such modulators may preserve the
cleavage of substrates like notch; thus, we adopted our initial
objectives from inhibition to modulation. notch-ligand interaction is a highly conserved mechanism that regulates specific
cell fate during development.21,22

n-alkylated  xxxd446xxx  derivatives were prepared (scheme 3)
to evaluate the contribution of the sulfonamide moiety in 9r
and the most active derivative 9p, where the sulfonamide is
shielded by isopropyl substituents. the  xxxd446xxx  benzyl ester
7 was alkylated using nah and rx in thf to yield the ester
10. subsequent benzyl deprotection by hydrogenation gave the
desired n-alkylated  xxxd446xxx  11. the benzyl deprotection of
10c was carried out by base hydrolysis.
the biotinylated  xxxd446xxx  derivative 12 was synthesized as
depicted in scheme 4 to identify the binding partner via
immunoprecipitation.
to evaluate the compounds for their potency in modulating
gamma-secretase activity, we used the  xxxg178xxx  liquid-phase electrochemiluminescence assay to measure  xxxg178xxx  isoforms.27 gamma-secretase
cleavage activity at the -site was monitored by de novo
production of aicd in vitro using the previously reported
assay.25
compounds 9a-s, 11a-f, and 12 turned out to be effective
modulators of gamma-secretase. they affected the cleavage at the
gamma38, gamma40, and gamma42 sites to a different extent and particularly
suppressed the formation of abeta42 while enhancing the formation
of abeta38 and thus showed the typical profile of effective nsaids
(see tables 1and 2, figures 3 and 4). compounds 9b,p and
11a,e,f were the most potent inhibitors of abeta42. interestingly,
the modulatory activity was preserved in the biotinylated 12,
which may therefore be used as an affinity reagent for

gamma-secretase. we observed from another series that n-alkylation
of carbazole with shorter n-alkyl chains such as n-butyl and
n-hexyl diminishes the gamma-secretase modulatory activity (unpublished results). the observed differences for octyl, nonyl, or
decyl substitution are small and so is the difference for
alkylsulfone amides of equivalent length (see 11e versus 9r).
the sulfone amides display an increased topological polar
surface area (tpsa) from 49 to approximately 93 √•2, which
makes blood-brain barrier penetration less likely.23 the calculated increase in tpsa is only partially compensated by a small
reduction of the clogp (- 0.5) in comparison to the analogue
alkyl derivatives. this favors the alkyl derivatives over the
sulfone amides for further investigation in animal models. the
n-benzylated or n-arylsulfonated derivatives benefit from
fluorinated substituents (9b, 11a) in the meta position. ortho
fluorination as in (9f) did not alter the activity in comparison
to the parent sulfonamide (9k). the replacement of the methoxy
group in 11b by a trifluoromethoxy resulted in a 5-fold
improvement of the ic50 (abeta42). this fluorine-derived enhancement may be due to lipophilicity or polar interactions. we
speculate that the lipophilic substituent anchors the n-substituted
 xxxd446xxx  in the required orientation within the membrane; thus,
the maximum tolerated length should be similar to those of
natural phospholipids. the effect of the most potent compounds
on gamma-secretase cleavage at the -site was assessed by an in vitro
assay that monitors the de novo generation of the app
intracellular domain (aicd).24,25 the generation of aicd was

of the mean.

affected by the compounds to various extent (figure 4).
however, consistent with previous results,3,7 generally much
higher compound concentrations than those determined to be
modulatory were required to inhibit the -cleavage. one of the
most active  xxxd446xxx  derivatives 11f was selected for evaluation
in cox-1 and cox-2 assays to rule out cox-1 or cox-2
mediated effects at the necessary concentrations for gammasecretase modulation. the assays were performed at cerep
(www.cerep.com) using indomethacin as a standard for cox-1
and ns398 (n-(2-(cyclohexyloxy)-4-nitrophenyl)methanesulfonamide) for cox-2. 11f displayed no activity on cox-1 and
only marginal activity on cox-2  xxxd1891xxx  ¬µm. no toxicity was
observed at 40 ¬µm in h4 cells except for 9p and 12, which
significantly decreased viability at 40 ¬µm, respectively (data
not shown).
in conclusion, the introduction of a single lipophilic substituent, which may vary from arylsulfone to alkyl substituents,
turns the cox-2 inhibitor  xxxd446xxx  into a gamma-secretase modulator
and improved potency 10-fold or more. thus, several compounds (e.g., 9p, 11f) caused the selective reduction of abeta42
and an increase of the less aggregatory abeta38. the most active
compounds are more potent than the best reported nsaids,
and they are devoid of cox-1 and cox-2 activity at the critical
concentration; thus, they do not interfere with the delicate cox1/cox-2 balance. some of the sulfonamides are comparable
in potency to the best n-alkylated analogues (11b), but the 50%
increase of the tpsa (9p: 93.4 √•2) makes a penetration of the
blood-brain barrier less likely. therefore, the n-alkylated
derivatives are favored over the sulfonamides for further
investigations. the properties of these n-alkylated lead candidates are close to the range of approved drugs or preclinical
candidates except for their clogp.26 the carboxylic acid group

letters

may interfere with uptake, but the tpsa of 11b is just 62.9 √•2.
this compares favorably to  xxxd2517xxx  ({2-[(2-chloro-6fluorophenyl)amino]-5-methylphenyl}acetic acid, tpsa ) 58
√•2). the more polar 11c has similar properties (tpsa ) 96.1,
clogp ) 5.83) as the carboxylic acid 5 (clogp ) 5.92, tpsa )
93.4 √•2).19 the lipophilic substituents cause amphiphilic properties of the carboxylic acids, which may interact with membranes.
however, the placement of a polar end group, as in 12,
weakened but did not reverse the modulatory effect. again, we
favor the n-alkylated derivatives for the investigation of
potential membrane interactions, as they allow the incorporation
of phospholipids analogues and membrane disrupting fragments.
if affected at all, the -cleavage of gamma-secretase was inhibited
at much higher compound concentrations than those determined
to be modulatory at the gamma-site (figure 4). the compounds are
therefore expected to have little or no impact on gamma-secretasemediated signaling via the aicd or via intracellular domains
of other gamma-secretase substrates. however, the interaction site of
these compounds has not been identified yet. the improvement
of potency and the investigation of in vivo activity are subject
to further investigations.
