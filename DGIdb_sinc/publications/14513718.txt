effects of steroidal and non steroidal drugs on the neovascularization response induced by tumoral ta3 supernatant on cam from chick embryo.  angiogenesis, the development of new blood vessels from the existing vascular network, may result as a consequence of the increase or decrease of proangiogenic or antiangiogenic factors, respectively. the tumor itself could up-regulate the production of angiogenic factors. recently, we established that the steroidal drug betamethasone in low concentration inhibit the neovascularization promoted by ta3 ts on cam of chick embryos. we describe here the effects of the non-steroidal drug  xxxd2423xxx , alone or in association with betamethasone, on the angiogenesis promoted by ta3 ts on cam. the main finding reported here is that the formation of new blood vessels is strongly inhibited by low concentrations of  xxxd2423xxx . the association of both drugs produced a synergistic effect, significantly decreasing tumoral supernatant angiogenesis. it is known that steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs inhibit the enzymes required for the production of prostaglandins through a nuclear gr mediated mechanism. this may operate as a general mechanism in endothelial cells as well. considering that the induction of cox 1 and  xxxg1884xxx  are inhibited by  xxxd2423xxx , and that these enzymes are located in the stromal compartment of the cam, we propose that its antiangiogenic effect may occur via inhibition of the two cox isoforms. in fact, we found that  xxxd2423xxx  induced apoptosis in both the stromal fibroblast and endothelial cells. the potentiated effect of the combination of betamethasone and  xxxd2423xxx  may have some therapeutic projections in the control of pathological angiogenesis.
