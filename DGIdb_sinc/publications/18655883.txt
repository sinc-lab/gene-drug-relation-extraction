abstract: the g protein coupled  xxxg1642xxx  (otr) reveals some speciﬁc molecular and
physiological characteristics. ligand–receptor interaction has been analysed by photoafﬁnity labelling,
site-directed mutagenesis, the construction of receptor chimeras and molecular modelling. major results of
these studies will be summarized. the n-terminus of the otr is mainly involved in agonist binding.
notably, antagonists that are derived from the ground structure of oxytocin, bind the receptor at distinct
sites partly non-overlapping with the agonist binding site. otrs are able to couple to different g proteins,
with a subsequent stimulation of phospholipase c-b isoforms. in dependence on g protein coupling, otrs
can transduce growth-inhibitory or proliferatory signals. some evidence is provided that otrs are also
present in form of dimeric or oligomeric complexes at the cell surface. the afﬁnity of the receptor for
ligands is strongly dependent on the presence of divalent cations (mg2+) and cholesterol that both act like
positive allosteric modulators. while the high-afﬁnity state of the receptor for agonists requires divalent
cations and cholesterol, the high-afﬁnity state for antagonists is only dependent on a sufﬁcient amount of
cholesterol. cholesterol affects ligand-binding afﬁnity, receptor signalling and stability. since the
puriﬁcation of the otr has never been achieved, alternative methods to study the receptor in its native
environment are necessary. promising strategies for the site-speciﬁc labelling of the otr will be presented.
the employment of diverse reporter molecules introduced at different positions within the otr might
allow us in the near future to measure conformational changes of the receptor in its native lipid
environment.

into the systemic circulation in response to a
variety of stimuli such as suckling, parturition or
certain kinds of stresses. maternal ot exerts a
powerful action on foetal neurons by inducing a
transient excitatory-to-inhibitory switch in their
gaba signalling shortly before delivery. reduced
neuronal activity may protect foetal brain from
hypoxic insults during delivery (tyzio et al., 2006).
ot is also synthesized in peripheral tissues, e.g.
in uterus, testis and heart. besides its classical

functions, labour induction and lactation, ot
plays an essential role in social behaviour, the
oestrous cycle, penile erection and ejaculation
(gimpl and fahrenholz, 2001). ot-deﬁcient mice
displayed impairments in milk ejection and social
recognition, but surprisingly no defects in parturition (nishimori et al., 1996). mice deﬁcient in the
 xxxg1642xxx  (otr) also exhibit normal parturition and defects in lactation and social behaviour (takayanagi et al., 2005). overall, the otr
system supports physiological processes associated
with reproduction at several levels in all vertebrates.
all neurohypophysial hormones are nonapeptides with a disulphide bridge between cys-1 and
cys-6 (fig. 1). this results in a peptide constituted
of a six-amino acid cyclic part and a c-terminal
a-amidated three-residue tail. the peptides are
classiﬁed into vasopressin and ot families, based
on the amino acid 8. the vasopressin family
contains a basic amino acid, whereas the ot family
contains a neutral amino acid at this position.
isoleucin in position 3 is essential for stimulating
the otrs and arg or lys in position 8 for acting
on vasopressin receptors. thus, the difference in
the polarity of these amino acid residues enable vasopressin and ot to interact with their

1

corresponding receptors (gimpl and fahrenholz,
2001).
oxytocin antagonists
oxytocin antagonists are valuable substances for
the treatment of preterm labour by reducing
myometrial contractions. previously, the antagonist
d(ch2)5[tyr-(me)2,thr4,orn8,tyr9]vasotocin has
been widely used (elands et al., 1988). however,
it exhibits substantial vasopressin v1a antagonism
(manning et al., 1995). atosiban, another peptide
antagonist, was shown to reduce the contraction rate in preterm labour and is used clinically
for the indication of delaying imminent preterm
birth. however, atosiban also suffers from lack of
speciﬁcity, e.g. it binds to the vasopressin v1a
receptor (akerlund et al., 1999) and its afﬁnity to
the otr is only sevenfold higher compared with its
afﬁnity to the vasopressin  xxxg231xxx . recently,
barusiban, a much more selective otr antagonist,
has been developed (nilsson et al., 2003). barusiban
shows several times higher afﬁnity and potency for
the human otr than vasopressin and any other
otr antagonist (pierzynski et al., 2004). the
structures of both atosiban and barusiban are
depicted in fig. 1.

oxytocin receptors
the otr belongs to the class a (rhodopsin-like)
superfamily of g protein coupled receptors
(gpcrs). within this class the vasopressin/otr
forms a small family that comprises three types of
vasopressin receptors, designated as v1a, v1b
and v2, and the otr. the vasopressin v2
receptor shows only 40% overall sequence identity
with the otr, but strongly discriminates between
the ligands [arg8]vasopressin and ot (structures
in fig. 1). [arg8]vasopressin is bound with nearly
400-fold higher afﬁnity than ot. the otr binds
ot and [arg8]vasopressin with similar high
afﬁnity (gorbulev et al., 1993; akerlund et al.,
1999). thus, chimeric ot/vasopressin  xxxg231xxx 
constructs can be used to identify ligand-binding
domains. employing displacement studies we have
investigated to what extent the introduction of
otr domains into the vasopressin  xxxg231xxx 
changes the afﬁnity of various ligands structurally
related to ot (postina et al., 1996; gimpl et al.,
2005).
ligand binding: agonists versus antagonists
ligand–receptor interaction has been studied by
photoafﬁnity labelling (breton et al., 2001), sitedirected mutagenesis (fanelli et al., 1999; hawtin
et al., 2001), the construction of receptor chimeras (postina et al., 1996; gimpl et al., 2005)
and molecular modelling (fanelli et al., 1999;
hawtin et al., 2001). major results of these studies
are summarized in the receptor model shown in
fig. 2.
the binding proﬁle for ot comprises the
extracellular amino-terminus e1 and the extracellular loops e2 and e3 of the receptor. the
contribution of the extracellular amino terminus
for ot binding has also been detected by other
studies (hawtin et al., 2001; wesley et al., 2002). in
particular, the amino acid residue r34 within the
e1 domain has been identiﬁed as essential for
high-afﬁnity ot binding using site-directed mutagenesis (wesley et al., 2002). in all members of the
neurohypophysial peptide  xxxg1603xxx 
family, an arginyl is conserved at this locus. this
residue might be required for agonist binding

throughout the receptor family. interestingly, the
binding proﬁles for ot and another agonist,
 xxxd434xxx , are very similar (gimpl et al., 2005).
 xxxd434xxx  is a highly stable agonist with a
long duration of action that binds to the otr
with 10-fold lower afﬁnity as compared with ot
(engstrom et al., 1998). overall, it appears that
the n-terminus of the otr is mainly involved
in agonist binding and can not select between
different agonists (hawtin et al., 2001; wesley
et al., 2002). glycosylation sites within the
n-terminal part of the otr are probably not
involved in agonist binding. receptor glycosylation may support efﬁcient receptor trafﬁcking and
enhanced cell surface expression (kimura et al.,
1997; wesley et al., 2002). as revealed by the
crystal structure of rhodopsin, the n-terminus of
gpcrs could form a compact domain which
overlays the extracellular loops (palczewski et al.,
2000; mirzadegan et al., 2003). according to molecular modelling, the ot-binding site is formed by
the upper parts of transmembrane helices 3–7 and
regions e2 and e3 (fanelli et al., 1999).
interestingly, ot antagonists have never been
found to bind to the n-terminus of the otr
(elands et al., 1988; postina et al., 1996; breton
et al., 2001; hawtin et al., 2001; wesley et al.,
2002; gimpl et al., 2005). in studies with chimeric
ot/vasopressin  xxxg231xxx  constructs, the competitive antagonist d(ch2)5[tyr(me)2,thr4,orn8,
tyr9]vasotocin (elands et al., 1988) has been
observed to bind at the transmembrane helices 1,
2, and upper parts of helix 7 (fig. 2), separate from
the agonist-binding domain (postina et al., 1996).
the photoreactive analogue of this antagonist
interacted with a tripeptide motif in the upper part
of transmembrane domain 3 of the otr (breton
et al., 2001). the homologue tripeptide motif
within the  xxxg229xxx  has also been
identiﬁed as a binding site for d(ch2)5[tyr(me)2,
thr4,orn8,tyr9]vasotocin (breton et al., 2001). in
terms of receptor speciﬁcity, results obtained with
this antagonist are therefore difﬁcult to interpret.
the binding domain of barusiban, the most
speciﬁc otr antagonist, clearly differs from the
binding domain of the non-selective antagonist
d(ch2)5[tyr-(me)2,thr4,orn8,tyr9]vasotocin. for
example, the tripeptide sequence ‘lvk’ at the

dotted rectangles, domains involved in coupling to gqa (hoare et al., 1999; yang et al., 2002; zhong et al., 2004; zhong et al., 2007).

upper part of transmembrane domain 3 (fig. 2)
that has been identiﬁed as binding site for the
non-selective antagonist by photoafﬁnity labelling
(breton et al., 2001), is probably not involved
in barusiban binding because the transfer of the
e2 domain into the vasopressin  xxxg231xxx  did
not result in increased afﬁnity for barusiban
(gimpl et al., 2005). using the chimeric receptor
approach, we provided evidence that the transmembrane domains 1 and 2 are in direct contact to
barusiban (gimpl et al., 2005). possibly, hydrophobic parts of barusiban, e.g.  xxxd1794xxx  at position 2,
interact with these transmembrane helices via
hydrophobic interaction.
overall, it is very likely that all ligands
structurally related to ot/vasopressin can bind

within a central receptor pocket of the otr.
due to the anti-clockwise arrangement of the
transmembrane helices of the otr (fig. 3),
amino acid residues far apart within the primary
sequence are spatially located close together.
different residues located at the central polar
pocket site of the receptor can interact with
otr agonists or antagonists (fig. 3). while
agonists form contact sites with both the ‘roof’
(i.e. amino terminus) and the extracellular loop
domains of the pocket, ot antagonists prefer
contact sites at the bottom of the pocket.
barusiban might gain its increased afﬁnity to the
receptor via dipping into the bottom of the
pocket between the transmembrane domains 1
and 2.

homodimeric receptor association. small black circle, position

by homology modelling using the programme ‘esypred3d’ with
the 3d structure of rhodopsin (pdb code 1f88) as template
(lambert et al., 2002). the ucsf chimera programme
(www.cgl.ucsf.edu/chimera) was employed for graphical display.

receptor activation
a network of interhelical hydrogen bonds and
hydrophobic interactions are proposed to

constrain the receptor in the inactive conformation. during activation of gpcrs rotations of
transmembrane helices relative to each other are
proposed to occur. in particular, due to bend
reduction helix 6 may move away from helix 3 and,
at its cytoplasmic end, towards helix 5 (ghanouni
et al., 2001). however, recent crystallographic
studies with photoactivated rhodopsin (albeit not
at the highest resolution) surprisingly suggested
that receptor activation is accompanied by only
minor structural rearrangements of transmembrane helices and their orientation to each other
(salom et al., 2006). instead, the activated receptor
undergoes structural disordering (relaxation)
mainly at the extracellular loops i2, i3 and the
c-terminus. this subsequently leads to increased
binding of the heterotrimeric g protein and its
activation.
otrs are able to couple to at least  xxxg923xxx  and gai
proteins (ku et al., 1995; strakova and soloff,
1997) that stimulate together with  xxxg433xxx  the
phospholipase c-b isoforms. this can induce an
increase in intracellular calcium concentration,
activation of various protein kinases (e.g. mitogen-activated protein kinases, protein kinase c,
myosin light-chain kinase) and/or production of
 xxxd1903xxx  (gimpl and fahrenholz, 2001;
zingg and laporte, 2003). in dependence on g
protein coupling, otrs can transduce growthinhibitory or proliferatory signals. receptor coupling to gai was shown to inhibit cellular
proliferation whereas coupling to another ga
protein was able to induce a growth-promoting
effect. interestingly, atosiban can act as a functional selective ligand, antagonistic on receptorgaq coupling but as an agonist on receptor-gai
coupling (reversi et al., 2005). more or less all
intracellular loops may contribute to the coupling
selectivity of the otr. for coupling to gq
proteins, two regions at the cytoplasmic side of
the otr have been found to harbour critical
motifs: juxtamembrane regions of intracellular
loop 3 (notably residue  xxxd1148xxx ) and the c-terminus
(see dotted boxes in fig. 2) (hoare et al., 1999;
zhong et al., 2004, 2007). particularly, residues in
the hydrophilic face of the putative amphipathic
helix 8 of the otr may be important for receptor

198

conformation and  xxxg923xxx  coupling (zhong et al.,
2004). the extent to which otrs signal via gi
seems to be species-speciﬁc, as judged by sensitivity against pertussis-toxin (blanks et al., 2007).
following stimulation of the otr, the homologous desensitization process is initiated by
receptor phosphorylation and subsequent arrestin
association. rapid and transient phosphorylation
by gpcr kinase-2, protein kinase c-a and
arrestin binding has been demonstrated in heterologous expression systems (berrada et al., 2000;
hasbi et al., 2004). internalization of the otr
primarily occurs via the clathrin-pathway (smith
et al., 2006).
structural studies with rhodopsin favour a model
in which dimers or higher-order oligomers are
functional receptor states (park and palczewski,
2005). using atomic force microscopy, rhodopsin is
the only receptor whose native oligomeric arrangement has been revealed (fotiadis et al., 2003). the
packing arrangement of rhodopsin molecules in
native disk membranes appears to possess not only
intradimeric, but also interdimeric and row–row
contacts. thereby, the strongest interactions are
provided by homodimeric receptor contacts via the
transmembrane segments 4 and 5 (fotiadis et al.,
2006). some evidence is provided that otrs are
also present in form of dimeric or oligomeric
complexes at the cell surface (terrillon et al.,
2003; devost and zingg, 2003). on the other hand,
a recent study convincingly demonstrated that
the monomeric b2-adrenergic receptor is sufﬁcient
to activate its corresponding g protein (whorton
et al., 2007).
oxytocin receptors and cholesterol
one remarkable property of the otr concerns its
functional dependence on cholesterol and divalent
cations. in vitro and in vivo, the receptor can exist
in at least two afﬁnity states for agonists and
antagonists. to exist in high-afﬁnity state, the
receptor requires at least two factors, namely
divalent cations such as mn2+ or mg2+, and a
high-cholesterol environment. in dependence on
these factors, the receptor can reversibly change its
conformation from high- (kd b 1 nm) to lowafﬁnity (kd b 100 nm) and vice versa (gimpl

et al., 1995; klein et al., 1995; gimpl et al., 1997).
unfortunately, the low-afﬁnity sites are difﬁcult to
characterize with binding studies. so, it cannot be
excluded that more than one population of lowafﬁnity receptor states exist. in each case, the
interaction of cholesterol with otrs is of high
speciﬁcity and not due to mere changes of the
membrane ﬂuidity (gimpl et al., 1997). to explore
the cholesterol-binding domain of the otr, a
variety of mutagenized or chimeric receptor
constructs have been analysed. site-directed mutagenesis was performed on the basis of a molecular
modelling study (politowska et al., 2001). therein,
cholesterol molecules were docked into the otr
using favourable and non-functional cholesterol
analogues. residues suggested as critical for
interaction with cholesterol are marked in fig. 2.
unfortunately, mutagenesis of most of these
residues to alanin resulted in receptors with nearly
undetectable expression yield (unpublished). we
hypothesize that the otr requires cholesterol
interaction not only to support its high-afﬁnity
state but also for efﬁcient receptor expression. this
conclusion is supported by studies with insect cells.
when otrs are expressed in insect cells that
naturally possess a low cholesterol content, addition of cholesterol to the culture has a much
stronger effect to gain high-afﬁnity state expression than addition of the same cholesterol amounts
to plasma membranes (gimpl et al., 1995).
possibly, cholesterol supports protein folding or
supports efﬁcient vesicular transport through the
secretory pathway. in a second approach, chimeric
ot/ xxxg353xxx  constructs were
created. this strategy was used in view of our
observations that the  xxxg353xxx 
showed no speciﬁc cholesterol interaction but
behaved similar to the otr with respect to signal
transduction (gimpl et al., 1997). preliminary
results with the chimeric receptor constructs
showed that transmembrane segments 6 and 7 are
dispensable for cholesterol binding.
cholesterol also stabilizes the otr against
thermal or proteolytical degradation (gimpl and
fahrenholz, 2002). in cholesterol-rich microdomains such as caveolae or lipid rafts, otrs were
signiﬁcantly more stable than in cholesterol-poor
domains (gimpl and fahrenholz, 2000). if the

otr becomes forced into lipid rafts by c-terminal
fusion with caveolin, a marker of these domains, a
switch in the proliferative behaviour of cells has
been observed: a growth-inhibitory effect induced
by ot reversed to a proliferative response (guzzi
et al., 2002). thus, the population of otrs
residing in cholesterol-rich domains may transduce
via different signalling cascades as compared to
receptors localized in domains with a lower
cholesterol amounts. the integrity of cholesterolrich domains also inﬂuences the behaviour and
signalling of many other gpcrs (chini and
parenti, 2004). a couple of gpcrs have now
been analysed with respect to their ligand-binding
parameters in dependence on the cholesterol status
of the cells or membranes. for almost all receptors
so far studied, cholesterol is positively correlated
with the afﬁnity state or ligand capacity (table 1).

 xxxg1642xxx  research: quo vadis?
the major goal of receptor biochemistry is to
obtain structural informations about the receptor,
e.g. their conformational changes induced by
ligand binding or g protein association. despite
much efforts puriﬁcation has been achieved only
for a handful of receptors. in case of the otr, all
attempts to purify the functional receptor have
been unsuccessful to date. however, even when
receptor puriﬁcation would be successful, uncertainty remains whether structural informations

obtained with puriﬁed preparations truly reﬂect
the situation in vivo. this is due to the fact that the
solubilization process dramatically alters the lipid
environment of the puriﬁed receptor. a receptor
that is normally localized in a speciﬁc microdomain, e.g. in a cholesterol-rich milieu for the
otr, might behave differently when isolated
from its lipid environment. one possibility to
overcome these limitations is to perform studies
with receptors that are tagged with different
reporter groups via recombinant dna techniques.
the most prominent and widely used reporter is
green ﬂuorescent protein (gfp) and its various
spectroscopic variants. the otr tagged at the
c-terminus with gfp behaves like the wild-type
receptor. using ﬂuorescence microscopy or spectroﬂuorometry receptor trafﬁcking could be
followed and/or total receptor amounts could be
quantitated independent on their afﬁnity state
(gimpl and fahrenholz, 2000). in case of the
parathyroid  xxxg1603xxx  and the a2a-adrenergic receptor even two gfp variants have been
introduced (at the intracellular loop 3 and the
c-terminus, respectively) that allowed to measure
the millisecond activation switch of the receptors
by ﬂuorescence resonance energy transfer (fret)
(vilardaga et al., 2003). however, gfp is a relatively large molecule. most likely, it will perturb
receptor function when introduced for example
at positions within loop domains of the receptor.
ideally, the researcher wishes to introduce small
reporter groups into different positions of the

receptor in a highly selective manner. the methodology for site-speciﬁc labelling of proteins has
greatly expanded in the last years. here, we will
shortly describe two promising tagging strategies
that both use small peptide targeting sequences:
(i) the 13-aa a-bungarotoxin-binding site (bbs)
(fig. 4a), and (ii) a 11-aa tag (named ‘ybbr’-tag
because part of its sequence is derived from
the ybbr orf in the b. subtilis genome) for
covalent attachment of reporter groups from coaderivatives (fig. 4b).
in the ﬁrst approach, the bbs tag binds to the
b8.4 kda protein bungarotoxin with high-afﬁnity
(sekine-aizawa and huganir, 2004). due to the
possibility to attach different reporter groups (e.g.
biotin or ﬂuorochroms) to bungarotoxin, this
strategy offers a versatile tool to explore receptor
trafﬁcking. we have demonstrated that this
strategy principally works for the otr (unpublished). notably, only receptors residing at or
translocating to the plasma membrane can be
selectively labelled simply by adding ﬂuorescent
bungarotoxin to the culture medium. this is a
major advantage as compared to the gfp-tagged
receptors that are always present in all stages
throughout the secretory pathway. the second
approach exploits the property of sfp phosphopantetheinyl (ppant) transferase that covalently
transfers 4u-phosphopantetheinyl groups from
coa-derivatives onto the serin residue within the
‘ybbr’-tag (yin et al., 2005). the sfp transferase
accepts a wide range of small molecules attached
to coa as substrate. thus, the method allows
the covalent labelling of ybbr-tagged receptors
by a variety of reporter probes such as biotin,
photoreactive compounds, ﬂuorophores or small
peptides. the site-speciﬁc labelling reaction can
be performed on cell lysates or living cells within
minutes. application of this method is more
laborious because it requires the synthesis of coacontaining substrates and the puriﬁcation of the
sfp transferase. provided that the tag adopts an
amphiphilic a-helix within its targeting sequence of
the receptor, a covalent labelling with the reporter
group may be achieved. we are currently testing
this strategy for the otr.
the employment of environmental-sensitive
ﬂuorescent probes in combination with orthogonal

receptor labelling might enable us in the near
future to measure conformational changes of the
receptor by spectroscopic and imaging techniques
in living cells.
