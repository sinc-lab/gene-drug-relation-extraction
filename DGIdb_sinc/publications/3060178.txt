introduction
this review discusses (a) the structure and possible functions of two vitamin­
k-dependent bone proteins,  xxxg260xxx  (bgp; osteocalcin) and matrix
gla protein (mgp), and (b) the insights into the mechanisms of  xxxd3522xxx 
action that have been obtained by analyzing these two proteins. bgp and
mgp are both regulated by 1,25- xxxd408xxx  [1,25(ohhd3], and
their functions are presumed to be linked to the actions of  xxxd1682xxx   xxxd2019xxx  on bone.
at present, these two proteins are the only well-characterized vitamin-k­
dependent vertebrate proteins other than the proteins involved in blood
coagulation. comparison of the amino acid sequences of mgp and bgp with
the sequences of coagulation proteins has identified probable structures that
target proteins for i'-carboxylation. comparison of the action of warfarin on

bgp synthesis and on blood coagulation times has also revealed a marked
difference in  xxxd3522xxx  metabolism between liver and bone. the general
aspects of bgp structure, regulation, biosynthesis, and function were recently
reviewed (41) and are not discussed here.

structure and properties of bgp and mgp
mature  xxxg260xxx  is a 49- or 50-residue protein containing three
residues of '}'-carboxyglutamic acid and one disulfide bond (41, 49). bgp is
secreted by osteoblasts (34, 41) and is one of the most abundant
noncollagenous bone proteins, accounting for 15-20% of the noncollagenous
protein in the bone of most vertebrates (41). bgp is also found in dentine and
is secreted by odontoblasts (2). low levels of bgp can be detected in most
soft tissues because it is present in plasma (41), but bgp mrna has not been
detected in any nonmineralized tissue examined to date (j. d. fraser and p.
a. price, personal observations). in vitro, bgp binds strongly to hydroxyapa­
tite (kd= 10-7 m) and is a potent inhibitor of hydroxyapatite formation (44).
both properties are lost when the three '}'-carboxyglutamic acid residues in
bgp are decarboxylated to  xxxd2431xxx  (40).
the structure of the initial bgp translation product, prepro rat bgp (figure
1), can be subdivided into a 23-residue transmembrane signal sequence, a
26-residue propeptide, and the 50-residue mature bgp isolated from rat bone

(38). the structure of pro bgp was established by direct sequence analysis of
the bgp precursor that builds up in warfarin-treated rat osteosarcoma cells
(39). these studies also showed that the n-terminal sequence of bgp secreted
into the culture media of vitamin-k-replete and warfarin-treated cells is
identical to mature bgp isolated from rat bone (39), which establishes that
proteolytic processing of pro bgp to bgp precedes secretion of bgp from the
cell and is independent of -y-carboxylation.
matrix gla protein has five gla residues and is 84 residues in length (figure
2). there is sufficient sequence identity between bgp and the c-terminal 42
residues of mgp (figure 3) to indicate that bgp and this region of mgp must
have arisen from a common ancestor by gene duplication and subsequent
divergent evolution (52). since bovine mgp is more closely related to
swordfish bgp than to bovine bgp (figure 3), it is likely that the gene
duplication event that gave rise to bgp and mgp preceded the divergence of
swordfish from other vertebrates, an event that must have occurred early in
vertebrate evolution.
in spite of their common ancestry, bgp and mgp have remarkably differ­
ent physical properties and a different tissue distribution of synthesis. bgp is
exceptionally soluble in neutral aqueous solutions (> 150 mg/ml). in contrast,
mgp is almost insoluble in neutral aqueous solutions «20 jlg/ml) unless
denaturants such as 6-m guanidinium hci are present (37, 51). the insolubil­
ity of mgp reflects a strong tendency of the protein to self-associate, which is

particularly noteworthy given its high percentage of hydrophilic amino acids
and its small size (52). while bgp is found only in bone and dentine, mgp is
found at comparable levels in bone, dentine, and cartilage (18). northern blot
analysis with a cdna probe for mop has demonstrated that mop mrna is
also found in cartilage as well as in bone (18). the high levels of mop in
cartilages that are not mineralized demonstrate that mop can anchor to the
organic matrix independently of mineral. the association of mgp with the
organic matrix rather than with mineral was ftrst proposed to account for the
observation that a major fraction of mop emerges only during extraction of
demineralized bone with denaturants (37, 51).
we have recently determined the cdna structure of rat mgp (45). the 521
base pair sequence predicts an 84-residue mature mgp and a 19-residue
transmembrane signal sequence. the cdna structure of mgp reveals it to be
the ftrst example of a vitamin-k-dependent protein that lacks a propeptide
(45). the absence ·of a propeptide in mgp demonstrates that the ')'­
carboxylation and secretion of vitamin-k-dependent proteins need not be
linked to the presence of a propeptide or to its proteolytic removal.
the 84-residue rat mgp predicted from the cdna sequence has an addi­
,tionalfive residues .at its c-terminus that are not present in the 79-residue

mgp isolated from bovine bone. the first two residues of this c-terminal
pentapeptide are arg-arg, a dibasic site at which proteolytic processing
frequently occurs (24). although it is not yet known whether proteolytic
cleavage to remove the c-terminal pentapeptide precedes the secretion of
mgp from the cell, a closely spaced doublet has been noted in the western
blot analysis of mgp in guanidine extracts of bone and cartilage from rat and
calf. if this doublet represents the 84-residue protein predicted from the
cdna and the 79-residue protein from bone whose structure was determined
by amino acid sequencing, both proteins must be present at comparable levels
in the extracellular matrix and proteolytic processing probably occurs after
secretion. it is clearly important to know the function of proteolytic process­
ing at the c-terminus of mgp and, in particular, whether the extraordinary
water insolubility of the 79-residue mgp isolated from bone, an unusual
feature of the protein given its high percentage of hydrophilic amino acids and
small size (37, 51, 52), is also a property of the 84-residue protein.
substrate recognition by the vitamin-k-dependent
y-glutamyl carboxylase

we previously showed that the propeptide of bgp contains a region (-16 to
-1 in figure 4) that is homologous to the propeptide of the vitamin-k­
dependent proteins involved in blood coagulation, and postulated that the
homologous propeptide domain is a recognition site for the 'y-carboxylase
(38, 39). although mgp has no propeptide, there is a region of the mature
protein (-16 to -1 in figure 4, bgp numbering) that is homologous to the
propeptide of all other vitamin-k-dependent vertebrate proteins.
we have recently discovered a previously unrecognized invariant structure
in the gla-containing region of vitamin-k-dependent vertebrate proteins, the
sequence gla-x-x-x-gla-x-cys (e- - -e-c, positions 17 to 23 in figure 4)
(45). the separation between the first glu in this invariant structure (e at+ 17)
and the previously recognized invariant arg in the homologous propeptide
domain (r at -1) is 15 to 17 residues in all cases except mouse bgp, where
the separation is 12 residues. if the sequences of the homologous propeptide
domain and the gla-containing region of known vitamin-k-dependent ver­
tebrate proteins are compared (-16 to + 30, figure 4), the two vitamin-k­
dependent bone proteins, bgp and mgp, are each as closely related to
coagulation proteins as to each other. there are two additional residues that
are invariant in mgp and in all coagulation proteins but not in bgp (a at
-10, e at + 30), and one additional residue that is invariant in bgp and in all
coagulation proteins but not in mgp (l at +6). there are, for comparison,
only two residues that are invariant in bgp and mgp but are not found in
coagulation proteins (r at +20, c at +29). these sequence relationships are
consistent with the hypothesis that the propeptide-gla domain unit of known

vitamin-k-dependent b0ne proteins

571

vitamin-k-dependent vertebrate proteins evolved from a common ancestor by
gene duplication and subsequent divergent evolution and indicate that the two
bone proteins probably diverged from this common ancestor at about the same
time as coagulation proteins.
there is evidence that the invariant propeptide and gia domain units of
vitamin-k-dependent proteins both play a role in substrate recognition by the
y-carboxylase. site-directed mutagenesis studies have shown that two con­
served amino acids in this region of  xxxg752xxx  (f at - 16, a at - 10; figure 4)
are indeed important to recognition by the y-carboxylase (22). although the
importance of the e- - -e-c unit has not yet been tested by site-directed
mutagenesis, there is indirect evidence to support a role for the e- - -e-c unit
in y-carboxylase binding to substrate. a variety of peptides have been syn­
thesized corresponding to the sequences of vitamin-k-dependent proteins in
gla-containing regions but lacking the invariant e---e-c unit (56,58). none
of these peptide substrates have km values lower than a few millimolar (7,
6 1). in contrast, intact bgp and the peptide corresponding to residues 13-29
in prothrombin both prove to be excellent y-carboxylase substrates (7, 6 1)
after gia residues are converted to giu by decarboxylation (40). for both
decarboxylated polypeptides, km values are 102_ to 103-fold lower than for
the best known synthetic peptide substrate, fleel (7, 61). since de­
carboxylated bgp and prothrombin 13-29 both lack the homologous pro­
peptide domain yet retain the e- - -e-c invariant structure, the excellent
substrate activities of these decarboxylated polypeptides is strong evidence for
a role of the e- - -e-c structure in y-carboxylase binding to substrate.
a problem with the previously proposed mechanism for substrate recogni­
tion by the y-carboxylase (38, 39) is that the propeptide segment recognized
by the y-carboxylase did not include the  xxxd2431xxx  substrate. there was,
therefore, no mechanism by which the enzyme could directly sense reaction
progress and so dissociate from product. if the e- - -e-c domain is critical to
substrate binding, it would provide a mechanism by which y-carboxyglutamic
acid formation and product binding to the y-carboxylase could be linked,
since both  xxxd2431xxx  residues in this structure are invariably sites of
y-carboxylation (figure 4). it is noteworthy that a cysteine residue is part of
this invariant structure. the y-carboxylase has an essential sulfhydryl group
(58), and the y-carboxylase assay is carried out under reducing conditions (7,
6 1) that would be predicted to reduce the disulfide bond in in vitro substrates
such as decarboxylated bgp and prothrombin 13-29. we speculate that the
invariant substrate cysteine could form a disulfide bond with the essential
sulfhydryl of the y-carboxylase. this covalent bond would form upon sub­
strate recognition, a process that would include interaction with the pro­
peptide and e- - -e-c domains of substrate, and would serve to anchor sub­
strate to enzyme while y-carboxylation of accessible  xxxd2431xxx  residues

invariant propeptide and e---e-c units will be fully y-carboxylated. mgpis
the first example of a vitamin-k dependent protein in which a  xxxd2431xxx 
-

residue that lies on the n-terminal side of 'the putative structures involved in
substrate recognition is y-carboxylated. this demonstrates that  xxxd2431xxx 

residues on either side of the substrate recognition site have access to the
active site of the y-carboxylase. the structure of mgpalso shows that some
 xxxd2431xxx  residues in the vicinity of the putative substrate recognition site
are not y-carboxylated (residues 5, 8, 11 in figure 2). this observation
indicates that proximity to the substrate recognition site is not sufficient in

itself to target  xxxd2431xxx  residues for modification, and that other factors,
such as the secondary structure of the polypeptide or the chemical nature of
nearby amino acid side chains, may determine which  xxxd2431xxx  residues
in this region are y-carboxylated. in our conceptual model of substrate
recognition by the y-carboxylase, enzyme binds target protein at sites that do

not d irectl y involve most of the  xxxd2431xxx  residues subsequently modified.
the property determining whether a given  xxxd2431xxx  residue in the
vicinity of the y-carboxylase becomes modified would therefore be the affin­
ity of that  xxxd2431xxx  residue for the catalytic site of the y-carboxylase.
residues with a high affinity for the catalytic site would be quantitatively

y-carboxylated during the lifetime of the complex formed between the y­
carboxylase and the substrate recognition sites (propeptide and e- --e-c

units). residues with a very low affinity would not be detectably y­
carboxylated; this presumably is the case for residues

5, 8, and 11 in mgp

(figure 2).

in this model, it is clearly possible to have  xxxd2431xxx  residues with an
intermediate affinity for the catalytic site that are only partially

y­

carboxylated during the lifetime of the y-carboxylase-target protein complex.
we believe this is the case for residue

2 in mgp, which is 80% gla and 20%

giu in the bovine and rat proteins (45, 52), and for residue 17 in human bgp,
which is 9% gla and 91% glu (41). if partial y-carboxylation does depend on
the affinity of given  xxxd2431xxx  residues for the catalytic site, sites of
partial y-carboxylation should be sensitive indicators of the probability of
y-carboxylation during the lifetime of the target protein-y-carboxylase com­

plex. any factor such as  xxxd3522xxx  nutritional status or presence of a vitamin

k antagonist, that changes the catalytic rate of '}'-carboxylation will, by these
arguments, be most readily detected at the  xxxd2431xxx  residues that are
partially '}'-carboxylated. for example, if the portion of non-'}'-carboxylated
 xxxd2431xxx  residues at a good site is 0.1%, reducing the catalytic rate of the
'}'-carboxylase by 50% would increase the portion not '}'-carboxylated to

0.2%, an amount that cannot be detected by chemical analysis. for residue 2
in mgp, which is normally 20% non-,},-carboxylated, reducing the rate of
'}'-carboxylation by 50% would increase the portion not '}'-carboxylated to

40%, an amount that can be easily detected by chemical analysis. sites of

partial '}'-carboxylation in vitamin-k-dependent proteins should therefore be
exceptionally sensitive and useful indicators of the in vivo rate of '}'­
carboxylation.
it is worth noting an obvious corollary to this argument. proteins with a
functionally important  xxxd2431xxx  residue that is normally a site of partial
'}'-carboxylation will be far more affected by a given degree of  xxxd3522xxx 
deficiency or a given dose of a  xxxd3522xxx  antagonist than will proteins in
which

all functionally important  xxxd2431xxx  residues are fully

'}'­

carboxylated. human bgp is a case in point, and we propose that the function
of bgp in human bone can be compromised by nutritional levels of  xxxd3522xxx 
that are still able to support a normal blood coagulation time.

the effect of warfarin on bgp synthesis
before reviewing the bgp response to the vitamin antagonist warfarin, it is
necessary to discuss plasma bgp and its relationship to bgp in bone. we
developed the radioimmunoassay for bgp, discovered bgp in serum and
plasma, and demonstrated that plasma bgp is an excellent marker for bone
metabolism

(47, 48). plasma bgp is identical in size to bgp in bone, arises

from new synthesis by osteoblasts, and appears to represent the fraction of
bgp secreted from the osteoblast that fails to bind to bone mineral and so
diffuses into blood (55). these relationships are illustrated schematically in
figure

5.

shortly after the administration of warfarin to a vitamin-k-replete rat,
serum bgp loses its ability to bind hydroxyapatite strongly (figure

6). this

reflects the undercarboxylation of the protein (55), although it is not known
whether one, two, or all three gla residues are in fact required for hydroxy­
apatite binding. if warfarin is administered daily, bone levels of bgp de­
crease to 2% of normal over several weeks, essentially at the rate at which
bone matrix turns over. bone levels of bgp remain at this decreased level as
long as warfarin treatment is continued

(53).

these observations indicate that warfarin affects the '}'-carboxylation status
of new bgp synthesis soon after its administration. since normal '}'­
carboxylation is required for bgp to anchor to hydroxyapatite in bone, nearly

figure 5

schematic outline of the probable relationship between  xxxg260xxx  secretion by

osteoblasts and its accumulation in bone or serum. in warfarin-treated animals, the non-,),­
carboxylated form of bgp that is secreted cannot bind to bone mineral and consequently appears
at elevated levels in serum (cf figure 6).

all new bgp synthesized by osteoblasts escapes to serum, where it elevates
total levels of serum bgp (figure 6). total bone levels of bgp change
slowly, as the bgp-replete matrix synthesized prior to warfarin treatment is
gradually resorbed by osteoclasts and replaced with a bgp-deficient matrix.
the protocol we devised to determine the effect of chronic warfarin ad­
ministration on bone levels of bgpemployed massive warfarin dosages (7.7
mg/ioo g body weight/day) together with the minimum  xxxd3522xxx  dosage
needed to prevent acute problems of bleeding (53). animals maintained on
this protocol for the long periods needed to observe altered bone structure (8
months) were remarkably free of any bleeding problems, even though bone
levels of bgp remained at 2% of normal (54).
we have recently discovered that the  xxxd3522xxx  dosage employed in our
warfarin protocol completely counteracts the effect of warfarin on blood
coagulation after approximately 7 days (46). we had previously failed to
recognize this effect because coagulation times were in fact quite elevated at 3
to 4 days of treatment with  xxxd3535xxx   xxxd3522xxx , the time arbitrarily
chosen in the earlier studies to establish the proper  xxxd3522xxx  dosage.
pretreatment for 7 days with the  xxxd3522xxx  dosage used in the protocol
reduced the degree to which coagulation times were prolonged after 4 days of
warfarin treatment (46). the prolonged coagulation time at 4 days of warfarin
treatment could be completely prevented by administering a single dose of 40

mg of  xxxd3522xxx  per 100 g body weight one day prior to the start of treatment
with  xxxd3535xxx   xxxd3522xxx  (46). surprisingly, the hydroxyapatite binding
activity of serum bgp remained at 5% of normal regardless of  xxxd3522xxx 
pretreatment or the duration of treatment with  xxxd3522xxx  plus warfarin (46).
to obtain a better measure of the ability of  xxxd3522xxx  to counteract the
effect of warfarin on blood coagulation and on serum bgp, we evaluated the
warfarin dose dependence of both effects in rats treated with  xxxd3522xxx 
compared to rats not receiving the vitamin (46). as can be seen in figures 7
and 8,  xxxd3522xxx  treatment completely prevented the ability of high warfarin
doses to prolong blood coagulation times but had essentially no ability to alter
the warfarin dose dependence of the serum bgp response. since, in the
absence of  xxxd3522xxx  treatment, comparable warfarin dosages were required
to double coagulation times (50 jlg/loo g/day) and to reduce the hydroxyapa­
tite binding activity of bgp by 50% (30 jlg/loo g/day), the inherent warfarin
sensitivities of the bone and liver systems are identical. the difference
between the two systems is that  xxxd3522xxx  treatment completely counteracts
warfarin effects on blood coagulation but not on bgp synthesis.

the ability of high  xxxd3522xxx  dosages to counteract the effect of warfarin
on blood coagulation has been known for many years (29). present evidence
indicates that  xxxd3522xxx  treatment enables a warfarin-insensitive enzyme to
reduce the  xxxd3522xxx  epoxide product of the ,),-carboxylation reaction back to
the hydroquinone (62, 63). without  xxxd3522xxx  treatment, endogenous levels
of  xxxd3522xxx  in the hepatocyte are evidently too low to allow significant
reduction of the epoxide by this warfarin-insensitive pathway and ')'­
carboxylation ceases. our results demonstrate that this warfarin-insensitive
pathway is not significantly active in the osteoblasts of vitamin-k-treated rats.
osteoblasts therefore must either lack the warfarin-insensitive epoxide reduc­
tase or are unable to accumulate sufficient  xxxd3522xxx  to enable this enzyme to
function at a rate sufficient to support ,),-carboxylation of bgp.

doses without affecting blood coagulation (46). thus the daily dosage of
warfarin, 7.7 mg/loo g/day, was over iso-fold greater than the dose required
to lower the hydroxyapatite activity of bgp by 50%, but blood coagulation
times were never greater than normal. any physiological changes elicited by
the  xxxd3535xxx   xxxd3522xxx  protocol must therefore be interpreted as a direct
effect of warfarin on bone, or on any other tissue with similar  xxxd3522xxx 
metabolism, rather than as any possible effect on blood coagulation.
the general health of rats maintained from birth to 8 months of age on the
 xxxd3535xxx   xxxd3522xxx  protocol was exceptionally good. weight gain was
unimpaired over the 8 months of treatment (53, 54), although there was a slight
decrease in bone growth after 3 months (see below). at no time during the
treatment was a significant difference noted in any parameter measured in the
standard smac test (sequential multiple analyzer with computer) of serum from
experimental and control rats. there was also no difference between experimental
and control animals in visual appearance, radiological analysis of skeletal
morphology, dentition, or the general ability to see and hear.

 xxxd3522xxx  that can be unambiguously related to the direct action of warfarin is
the excessive mineralization of growth plate cartilage, with eventual fusion of
the growth plate (54). in rats treated from birth to 8 months of age with
 xxxd3535xxx   xxxd3522xxx , growth plates were completely fused and longitudi­
nal growth had ceased. the overall length of the long bones was accordingly
reduced; for example, tibias of experimental animals were 7% shorter than the
8-month-old control rats. subsequent investigations revealed that growth
plate mineralization first becomes apparent at 3 months of age, the time at
which rapid skeletal growth is complete in the rat. this pattern of excessive

growth plate mineralization is strikingly similar to the fetal warfarin syndrome
in humans, a disorder seen in infants whose mothers had received warfarin
during the first trimester of pregnancy ( 19).
we have interpreted these observations as evidence that vitamin-k­
dependent bone proteins normally inhibit the seeded crystal growth of hy­
droxyapatite from the fully mineralized metaphysis into growth plate cartil­
age. when the action of  xxxd3522xxx  is antagonized by warfarin, the under-y­
carboxylated bone proteins now secreted are unable to retard seeded crystal
growth, and mineralization consequently engulfs the longitudinal septa of
growth cartilage. this eventually causes growth plate fusion. matrix gla
protein is currently the best candidate for the vitamin-k-dependent protein
that normally inhibits growth plate mineralization, since mgp is the only
vitamin-k-dependent protein known to be synthesized in cartilage ( 18).
however, because mgp is water insoluble (37, 5 1), it has not yet been
possible to evaluate the ability of mop actually to inhibit hydroxyapatite
crystal growth. it is worth noting that the structurally related protein bgp is a
potent inhibitor of hydroxyapatite crystallization only if it is y-carboxylated

(40, 4 1).
we have observed a second defect in the bone metabolism of animals
treated with  xxxd3535xxx   xxxd3522xxx , a defect seen only in the context of
physiological stress (50). rats received sufficient dosages of 1,25 (ohhd3 to
increase bop synthesis maximally (42), together with either  xxxd3535xxx 
 xxxd3522xxx  or  xxxd3522xxx  alone. treatment with 1,25(ohhd3 led to the
accumulation of unmineralized osteoid in the tibial metaphysis, while treat­
ment with 1,25(ohhd3 plus warfarin prevented this accumulation. we have
interpreted these observations as evidence that 1,25(ohhd3 stimulated the
synthesis of a vitamin-k-dependent mineralization inhibitor, which then
caused the accumulation of unmineralized osteoid. treatment with warfarin
caused the putative vitamin-k-dependent mineralization inhibitor to be secret­
ed in an inactive, under-y-carboxylated form, and consequently allowed the
mineralization of osteoid (50). we further suggested that the vitarnin-k­
dependent mineralization inhibitor is bop, since the synthesis of bgp is
stimulated 6- to lo-fold by 1,2s(ohhd3 (42, 43). with the recent discovery
that mop is similarly stimulated 6- to lo-fold by 1 ,25(ohhd3 in osteoblastic

cells (12), either mgp or bgp must now be regarded as a candidate for the
1,25(ohhd3-regulated protein that inhibits osteoid mineralization.
the warfarin treatment protocol has also been used to prepare bone matrix
for in vivo and in vitro tests of mineralized bone particle phagocytosis and
removal. when implanted in a vitamin-k-replete rat, the ground bone from
warfarin-treated rats was removed at only 60% of the rate of ground bone
from control rats (26). a similar impairment was also seen in the in vitro
degradation of bone particles by monocytes (25). these effects are apparently
due to the impaired recruitment and differentiation of cells capable of remov­
ing the dead bone particles (15). although the identity of the recruited cells
has yet to be firmly established, these cells do have tartrate-resistant acid
phosphatase, a biochemical marker for the osteoclast. since high con­
centrations of bgp are chemotactic for monocytes (32), a cell fraction
thought to contain osteoclast precursors, it has been suggested that the
impaired degradation of warfarin-treated rat bone is due to low levels of rgp.
one interpretation of the observation that dead bone matrix particles from
warfarin-treated rats are poorly degraded in vivo and in vitro is that a
vitamin-k-dependent protein, thought to be bgp, plays a critical role in the
normal resorption of bone (26). the stimulation of bgp synthesis by
1,25(ohhd3 would then be a mechanism by which 1,25(ohhd3 accelerates
bone resorption. although this is an intriguing model, the available in vivo
data on the effects of warfarin treatment on bone metabolism do not currently
support it. long-term warfarin treatment does not make rats detectably
osteopetrotic, the in vivo consequence of the total absence of osteoclastic
bone resorption. furthermore, long-term warfarin treatment has no effect on
the ability of rats to resorb bone in response to dietary calcium deficiency (53)
or 1,25(ohhd3 treatment (50).
implications of tissue differences in vitamin
k metabolism for warfarin prophylaxis

the obvious implication of the discovery that  xxxd3522xxx  counteracts warfarin
effects on blood coagulation but not on bgp synthesis is that blood coagula­
tion tests provide a reliable measure only of the effect of warfarin on the
hepatocyte. it is erroneous to infer warfarin sensitivity on bone from its effect
on coagulation times, because dietary levels of  xxxd3522xxx  (from food and
intestinal flora) determine the dose required to prolong blood coagulation but
not the dose required to inhibit normal bgp synthesis. thus it is possible to
have two individuals, one with a high average daily intake of  xxxd3522xxx  and a
correspondingly high warfarin dose required for prolonged blood coagulation
time and another with a low  xxxd3522xxx  intake and a correspondingly far lower
warfarin dose required to increase coagulation times. the first individual,
based on our results, will have a far greater impairment of bgp synthesis than

the second. this individual will be correspondingly at greater risk for any
complication, such as bone metabolic changes noted above, that is attribut­
able to the impaired synthesis of a gla-containing protein by an extrahepatic
tissue whose  xxxd3522xxx  metabolism is similar to bone. when the therapeutic
objective is to reduce the activity of the blood coagulation factors synthesized
by the liver, it would be advisable to regulate  xxxd3522xxx  intake so as to
minimize the warfarin dosage required.
the second, more intriguing, implication to warfarin prophylaxis is that we
can now contemplate an entirely new use for this drug. we can, by selectively
counteracting the effect of warfarin on blood coagulation with  xxxd3522xxx ,
stringently suppress the y-carboxylation of gla-containing proteins in tissues
with a  xxxd3522xxx  metabolism similar to bone without any concern whatever
about bleeding complications. it seems to us probable that most extrahepatic
tissues will fall into this category. storage of  xxxd3522xxx  is required before a
tissue can use the alternate, warfarin-insensitive pathway for reduction of
 xxxd3522xxx  epoxide to the hydroquinone (29, 62, 63), and liver is the only
organ known to store  xxxd3522xxx  (59).
there is at least one area in which we believe there is sufficient evidence to
justify experimental tests of the therapeutic efficacy of the  xxxd3535xxx 
 xxxd3522xxx  protocol. over the past seven years numerous studies have es­
tablished the synthesis of vitamin-k-dependent blood coagulation factors by
endothelial cells ( 10, 57), monocytes (35, 60), and macrophages (4, 27, 36).
each cell type has the ability, through the action of its endogenous fibrinolytic
pathway, to initiate thrombosis. these extrahepatic vitamin-k-dependent
coagulation systems each should, in our view, be susceptible to inhibition by
the  xxxd3535xxx   xxxd3522xxx  protocol. among the areas where warfarin has
documented activity (via a mechanism that could be due to extrahepatic
vitamin-k-dependent blood coagulation) are the suppression of tumor metas­
tasis (5, 16, 20, 33, 64) and the suppression of delayed-type hypersensitivity
(9). certain current therapeutic uses of warfarin may also be better managed
with  xxxd3535xxx   xxxd3522xxx . for example, venous thrombosis may in many
cases be due to endothelial cell activation of blood coagulation by a vitamin­
k-dependent mechanism. this could explain the clinical efficacy of warfarin
in this disorder at doses below those that prolong blood coagulation times ( 1),
since present evidence suggests that dietary  xxxd3522xxx  could selectively
reduce the effective dose of warfarin on the hepatic system. it is my hope and
expectation that the  xxxd3535xxx   xxxd3522xxx  protocol developed in our
laboratory will initiate an exciting new phase in warfarin prophylaxis.
