there are 11 human  xxxg1696xxx 
(pde) families. some selectively hydrolyze camp or cgmp,
whereas others hydrolyze both (beavo et al., 2006; conti and
beavo, 2007). important advances have been gained from
x-ray crystal structures of isolated catalytic domains (c domain) of several pdes, but contacts between catalytic site
amino acids of pde holoenzymes and cyclic nucleotides (cn)
or inhibitors are not fully understood for any pde (huai et
al., 2003; xu et al., 2004; blount et al., 2006; ke and wang,
2006; wang et al., 2006, 2007; zoraghi et al., 2007). the
pde11 family is derived from a single gene that produces
four splice variants; all hydrolyze camp and cgmp, although
this work was supported by the national institutes of health national
institute of diabetes and digestive and kidney diseases [grant dk40029]; the
national institutes of health national heart, lung, and blood institute
[grant 5t32-hl07752]; and american heart association predoctoral fellowship [grant 0515286b].

each. a cgmp analog lacking the c6 oxygen had ⬃80-fold
weakened affinity, modifications at n2, n7, or 2⬘-oh diminished
affinity ⬃16-fold, and analogs with groups appended at n1 had
only 2- to 6-fold weakened affinity. analogs with c8 substitutions were ineffective inhibitors, suggesting that cgmp binds in
the anti conformation. calculated decline in free energy of
binding was consistent with that for one hydrogen bond only in
the analog lacking binding potential at c6. in conclusion, gln869 interacts strongly with cgmp/camp and tadalafil, but not
with sildenafil; interactions with cn analogs suggest a hydrogen bond only between gln-869 and the c6 substituent. the
results define interactions between the pde11 catalytic site and
substrates/inhibitors and advance potential for inhibitor design.

kinetic characteristics for the variants are different (fawcett
et al., 2000; hetman et al., 2000; yuasa et al., 2000; weeks et
al., 2007). to date, there are no potent, specific inhibitors for
the pde11 family. tadalafil (cialis; lilly-icos co., indianapolis, in), which potently inhibits pde5, also inhibits
pde11 albeit with significantly lower affinity (weeks et
al., 2007); sildenafil (viagra) and vardenafil (levitra) are
weak inhibitors of pde11. most characteristics of the
pde11 catalytic site are unknown.
models of cns bound in pde catalytic sites have been
based on x-ray crystal structures of isolated c domains in
complex with low-affinity 5⬘-nucleotide catalytic product or
substrate-analog inhibitors because a cocrystal of a pde
wild-type (wt) c domain with cn is not available (xu et al.,
2004; zhang et al., 2004). in x-ray crystal structures of several isolated c domains of pdes and in models based on
these structures, the side chain of an invariant glutamine
forms two hydrogen bonds with the cn (fig. 1); in some
instances, similar bonds are formed with analogous positions

abstract
poor understanding of the topography of cyclic nucleotide (cn)
phosphodiesterase (pde) catalytic sites compromises development of potent, selective inhibitors for therapeutic use. in the
x-ray crystal structures of the catalytic domains of some pdes,
an invariant glutamine hydrogen bonds with groups at c6 and
n1 or n7 on catalytic products or analogous positions of some
inhibitors, inferring similar bonds with cns (nature 425:98 –102,
2003; j mol biol 337:355–365, 2004; mol cell 15:279 –286,
2004). a site-directed mutant (q869a) lacking this invariant gln
in cgmp-/camp-hydrolyzing pde11 had unaltered catalytic
activity and affinity for sildenafil; but cgmp/camp or tadalafil
affinity was reduced ⬃50- or 140-fold, respectively, and calculated free energy of binding suggested one hydrogen bond for

construction, expression, and purification of q869a mutant of pde11a4. the q869a mutant of human pde11a4 was
generated as follows: the expression plasmid containing full-length
pde11a4 (pfastbac-htc-pde11a4) was used as template with the
forward pcr primer 5⬘-gaactgcctcggttggcactggagtggattgatag-3⬘ and the reverse pcr primer 5⬘-ctatcaatccactccagtgccaaccgaggcagttc-3⬘ to generate the expression plasmid containing the q869a mutant, which was then verified
by dna sequencing and used to generate a recombinant baculovirus
as described for expression in sf9 cells. the expression and lysis
conditions for the q869a mutant were identical to those for wt
pde11a4. the q869a mutant was purified to essential homogeneity
by ni-nta affinity chromatography as described previously (weeks
et al., 2007). soluble supernatant from 2.8 ⫻ 109 cells infected with
the optimal amount of q869a virus was loaded onto a 11-ml ni-nta
column equilibrated in buffer containing 10 mm potassium phosphate, 25 mm  xxxd26xxx , roche complete protease inhibitors, 0.07 ␮g/ml pepstatin a, 250 ␮m pmsf or  xxxd502xxx , 1 ␮g/ml
leupeptin, 5 ␮m e-64, and 20 to 40 mm nacl at a final ph of 6.8. the
column was then washed with 20 ml each of 20, 25, 30, and 35 mm
imidazole in the same buffer. under the conditions tested, the majority of q869a enzyme remained bound to the column throughout
these washes. the column was then washed with 20 ml (⬃2 column
volumes) of the buffer containing 100 mm imidazole, ph 6.8. although this stringent wash eluted a small amount (⬍6% of bound
activity) of q869a mutant, it removed over 90% of contaminating
proteins. the column was then washed with 20 ml of the same buffer
containing 35 mm imidazole and then washed with 20 ml of the same
buffer that had been adjusted to ph 8.0. after this wash, the q869a
enzyme was eluted by the following method: 1 column volume of the
buffer containing 100 mm imidazole, ph 8.0, was applied to the
column and allowed to sit for 30 to 60 min at 4°c, after which
fractions (1 ml) were collected, and the process was repeated. eluted
fractions were assayed for pde11 catalytic activity at 300 nm
[3h]cgmp (described below), and elutions were repeated until the
eluted activity was negligible. fractions containing the highest activity or purity were pooled, dialyzed, and frozen as described previously (weeks et al., 2007).
measurement of pde11 catalytic activity. measurement of
maximal catalytic activity (vmax), michaelis-menten constant (km)
for camp or cgmp, and values for ic50 (inhibitor concentration at
50% inhibition) of inhibitors were determined using the pde catalytic activity assay essentially as described previously (weeks et al.,
2007). pde11 proteins were diluted in 10 mm potassium phosphate,
ph 6.8, with 25 mm ␤- xxxd26xxx  and 1 mg/ml bsa; in general,
10 ␮l of diluted enzyme was added to 90 ␮l of pde assay mixture (50

in inhibitors containing purine-like rings (sung et al., 2003;
zhang et al., 2004; ke and wang, 2006; wang et al., 2006,
2007, 2008a,b). in x-ray crystallographic structures of
 xxxg1700xxx  in complex structures with the 5⬘-amp catalytic
product, or 8-br-5⬘-amp, the invariant gln forms hydrogen
bonds involving the c6 amide and n1 or n7 (xu et al., 2004).
these reports 1) predict that two hydrogen bonds are important for high-affinity interaction of pdes with cns and inhibitors that are structurally similar to cns), 2) imply that
the bonds are essentially energetically equal for ligand binding, and 3) suggest that modifications at c6 and either n1 or
n7 of cns or analogous positions in purine-like inhibitors
would greatly diminish affinity for pde catalytic sites, thus
limiting design of inhibitors. despite widespread acceptance,
these concepts have not been verified using pde holoenzymes.
in pde5, site-directed mutagenesis of the invariant gln
(q817a) caused a major loss of affinity for cgmp substrate
and four inhibitors [sildenafil, vardenafil, tadalafil, and
 xxxd2388xxx  ( xxxd2388xxx )] (zoraghi et al., 2006,
2007); x-ray crystal structures indicate that three of these
(sildenafil, vardenafil, and  xxxd2388xxx ) form two hydrogen bonds
with the gln side chain involving the positions/substituents
that are analogous, respectively, to c6 and n1 in cgmp;
tadalafil forms only a single hydrogen bond with gln-817
(sung et al., 2003; huai et al., 2004). however, calculated
loss in free energy of binding for cgmp or the four inhibitors
in q817a was consistent with that for only one hydrogen
bond (zoraghi et al., 2006, 2007). whether this pattern was
unique to pde5 or would apply to other pdes was debated.
to advance understanding of the pde11 catalytic site and
improve the knowledge base for use in inhibitor design, we
have herein investigated the role of the invariant gln (gln869) as a determinant of substrate and inhibitor affinity
using mutagenesis (q869a), cgmp analogs, and a battery of
cn analogs to map features of the pde11 catalytic site. the
combined results support a critical role for a single hydrogen
bond between gln-869 and cns, or with the inhibitor
tadalafil, but no hydrogen bond with sildenafil. affinity of
pde11 catalytic site was greatly diminished for cns lacking
a c6 substituent and modestly weakened for those with
modifications at the n1, n2, n7, or 2⬘-oh. analogs with
groups appended at c8 did not measurably inhibit pde11,
suggesting that cgmp binds to the catalytic site in the anti
conformation. the results define molecular mechanisms for
interaction of pde11 with substrates and inhibitors, provide
new insights for design of pde11 inhibitors, and support the
interpretation that the invariant gln of pde11 holoenzyme
forms a single hydrogen bond with the c6 substituent in
catalytic-site ligands.

quantification of cn analog activation of cgmp-dependent protein kinase. bovine lung cgmp-dependent protein kinase
i␣ (pkgi␣) was purified to essential homogeneity using 8-(6-aminohexylamino)-camp-sepharose, and kinase activity was determined
as described previously (francis et al., 1991). pkg protein concentration was determined by the method of bradford (1976) using
staining reagent from bio-rad and bsa fraction v (sigma-aldrich)
as standard. five microliters of pkg␣ (0.002 ␮g) with a specific
activity of 10 ␮mol/min/mg was diluted in 10 mm potassium phosphate, ph 6.8, 1 mg/ml bsa, and added to 40 ␮l of a pkg reaction
mixture containing 150 ␮m of the synthetic heptapeptide
(rkrsrae), 120 ␮m atp with trace [32p]atp, 20 mm magnesium
acetate, 100 ␮m  xxxd2388xxx , 0.9 ␮m camp-dependent protein kinase
inhibitor (5–24), and 20 mm tris hcl, ph 7.4, in the presence and
absence of 5 ␮l of various concentrations of cgmp, 1-methyl cgmp,
or aliquots from the incubation of cgmp or 1-methyl-cgmp and
pde11a4 described above. samples were then incubated at 30°c for
20 to 40 min. reactions were terminated by spotting 35 ␮l of the
50-␮l reaction mixture onto whatman p-81 phosphocellulose cationexchange papers to determine the amount of 32p transferred to the
heptapeptide substrate. the papers were immediately dropped into
75 mm phosphoric acid, washed four times, dried, and counted.
a standard curve of activation of purified pkgi␣ kinase using
known concentrations of 1-methyl-cgmp or cgmp ranging from 0.01
to 0.4 ␮m was generated as described above, and a 10 ␮m cgmp
point was included as a positive control. the extent of breakdown of
the cns when incubated with pde11a4 was determined by analyzing samples of the supernatants in which 1-methyl-cgmp or cgmp
and pde11a4 had been incubated together for various periods of
time. pde assays containing the typical components (described
above) and 6 ␮m [3h]cgmp were conducted alongside as an additional control.

physical and kinetic characterization of pde11a4
q869a. q869a protein was expressed using the baculovirus
system in sf9 cells and purified to essential homogeneity as
described under materials and methods. q869a migrated on
sds-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (page) as a ⬃100kda protein (fig. 2), the migration of which was indistinguishable from that of wt pde11a4 (data not shown). affinities of q869a for cgmp (km ⫽ 50 ⫾ 1.5 ␮m) (fig. 3, a and
b) and camp (km ⫽ 94.6 ⫾ 7.33 ␮m) (fig. 3, c and d) were
⬃50- and 60-fold weaker than that of wt pde11a4 (km ⫽
1.0 ⫾ 0.07 and 1.6 ⫾ 0.2 ␮m, respectively) (table 1). vmax for
q869a was similar to that previously reported for wt enzyme (weeks et al., 2007).
role of gln-869 in affinity of pde11 for inhibitors.
the effect of substitution of alanine for gln-869 (q869a) on
affinity for tadalafil, a reasonably potent inhibitor of pde11,
or sildenafil (weeks et al., 2007), a weak inhibitor of pde11,
was determined using 0.1 ␮m cgmp as substrate. the affinity of q869a for tadalafil (ic50 ⫽ 10 ⫾ 3.9 ␮m) was 137-fold
weaker than that of wt pde11 (ic50 ⫽ 0.073 ⫾ 0.003 ␮m)
(fig. 4a; table 2). in contrast, affinity of q869a for sildenafil
(ic50 ⫽ 4.4 ⫾ 1.7 ␮m) was not significantly different from
that for wt pde11 (ic50 ⫽ 3.8 ⫾ 0.75 ␮m) (fig. 4b; table 2).
contribution of gln-869 to free energy of binding of
cgmp, camp, or inhibitors. the loss in energy involved in
potential interactions of the invariant gln in pde11 with
catalytic site ligands was calculated as described under materials and methods using the results derived above. the km
of substrates or ic50 of inhibitors of wt pde11 and q869a
was used to calculate the ⌬g; these values were then used to

mm tris-hcl, ph 7.5, 10 mm mgcl2, 0.5 mg/ml bsa, ph 7.5, with
trace [3h]cgmp or [3h]camp and unlabeled cn as indicated). reaction mixtures were incubated for various times at 30°c and terminated by addition of 20 ␮l of a stop mix containing 143 mm edta, 60
mm theophylline, 30 mm camp, 30 mm cgmp, and 286 mm trishcl, ph 7.5. the tubes were transferred to an ice-water bath. snake
venom nucleotidase (200 ␮g) was added to each tube, and reactions
were incubated for 30 min at 30°c before addition of 1 ml of an
ice-cold stop solution (0.1 mm adenosine, 0.1 mm guanosine, and 15
mm edta). reactions were applied to 2.1-ml qae-sephadex columns that had been equilibrated in 20 mm ammonium formate, ph
7.5, and the flow-through was collected. columns were washed with
2 ml of ammonium formate, and the combined flow-through eluants
were combined with 10 ml of scintillation fluid and counted in a
beckman scintillation counter (beckman coulter, fullerton, ca).
counts (counts per minute) were converted to picomole of cn hydrolyzed per minute per milliliter of enzyme. km values of human
pde11a4 isozymes for cgmp and camp were determined using
camp and cgmp concentrations ranging from 0.03 to 80 ␮m. km
studies for pde11 q869a were conducted at concentration of cn up
to 500 ␮m and with q869a concentration of 28 to 39 nm. reactions
were experimentally determined to be linear with respect to time
(data not shown). for determination of ic50 values for tadalafil or
sildenafil, pde11 proteins were analyzed using cgmp as substrate
at a concentration that was ⬃10 times below the experimentally
determined km. this method ensured that the ic50 obtained approached the ki. the apparent km and vmax values were determined
by nonlinear regression analysis of data with a single-site model in
prism graphpad software inc. (san diego, ca). in all studies, less
than 20% of total [3h]cgmp or [3h]camp was hydrolyzed during the
reaction. the km value approximates a dissociation binding constant
(kd) only when the enzyme-substrate complex is in thermodynamic
equilibrium. data for ic50 determinations were plotted and analyzed
with graphpad prism using a sigmoidal dose-response model. for
studies involving competition of unlabeled cgmp or cgmp analogs
with [3h]cgmp (0.1 ␮m) for the catalytic site, the apparent km/ki for
cgmp was 0.34 ␮m; this indicated that the substrate concentration
in these particular studies was 4-fold below the km; therefore, the
ic50 values for the three analogs were converted to ki values using
the following equation: ki ⫽ ic50/1 ⫹ [s]/km (cheng and prusoff,
1973).
calculation of free energy of binding. all values determined
represent at least three measurements, each in either duplicate or
triplicate. the value for the gibbs free energy change (⌬g) that
occurs by association of substrates or inhibitors with pde11 is related to the equilibrium association constant for the interaction and
were calculated as described from ⌬g ⫽ ⫺rt ln k, where k ⫽ km or
ki were calculated as described above. r is the ideal gas constant
(equal to 1.98 ⫻ 10⫺3 kcal deg⫺1 mol⫺1), and t is the temperature at
which the assay was done (303°k).
the contribution of a substituted amino acid side chain to the
gibbs free energy of binding in an enzyme-transition state complex
was calculated from ⌬⌬g ⫽ ⌬gwt ⫺ ⌬gmut, where ⌬⌬g is the
change in free energy of binding in enzyme transition-state complexes attributable to the substituted group. ⌬gwt and ⌬gmut are
the gibbs free energy change for wt pde11 and mutant (q869a),
respectively.
assays for pde11 hydrolysis of 1-methyl-cgmp. pde11a4
was highly purified as described by weeks et al. (2007). the enzyme
was added to a typical pde reaction mixture containing 50 mm tris
hcl, ph 7.5, 0.5 mg/ml bsa, 10 mm mgcl2, and 6 ␮m 1-methylcgmp or cgmp and incubated at 30°c for 30 to 60 min. reactions
were terminated by placing samples in a boiling water bath for 7 min
followed by centrifugation in a tabletop centrifuge at 6000 rpm for 10
min. extent of hydrolysis of 1-methyl-cgmp and cgmp was determined using aliquots of the supernatants in assays to activate purified cgmp-dependent protein kinase as described below.

calculate the loss in free energy of binding (⌬⌬g) in the
q869a protein compared with wt pde11. the loss in free
energy of binding (⌬⌬g) of cgmp, camp, tadalafil, or sildenafil, respectively, to q869a was calculated to be 2.4, 2.4, 3.0,
and 0.1 kcal/mol. these values reflected the change in binding affinities for the respective ligands caused by loss of the
gln-869 side chain in the pde11 catalytic site, and the loss
in free energy of binding for cgmp, camp, and tadalafil was
consistent with that for a single hydrogen bond (2.5– 4 kcal/
mol) (wilkinson et al., 1983; andrews et al., 1984).
mapping of pde11 catalytic site interactions using
cn analogs: assessment of importance of contacts
with n1, n2, n7, c6 oxygen, c8, or 2ⴕ-hydroxyl of
cgmp on affinity for pde11. cn analogs were then used
in a complimentary study to assess the relative importance of
two putative hydrogen bonds between the wt pde11 gln869 side chain and the c6 oxygen and n1 of cgmp, to systematically define the relative importance of various structural features for high-affinity interaction of pde11 with
substrate, and to characterize the physical and chemical
properties of the pde11 catalytic site that could affect binding of potential inhibitors. a range of concentrations of either
unlabeled cgmp or cn analogs was added to a typical pde
reaction mixture as described under materials and methods
using 0.1 ␮m [3h]cgmp as substrate, and potency (ic50) of
inhibition, or competition, by unlabeled cgmp or cgmp analogs was determined. the ic50 values were converted to ki

as described under materials and methods. ki for unlabeled
cgmp competition with [3h]cgmp hydrolysis in this series of
experiments was 0.34 ⫾ 0.03 ␮m (table 3). these studies
were conducted with cgmp analogs because more of these
nucleotides containing the modifications of interest are commercially available compared with camp analogs.
importance of contacts and space at n2. appending
an amino-hexyl at n2 (2-amino-hexyl-cgmp) or absence of
the c2-amide as in cimp had little or no effect on affinity of
pde11 for the cn (table 3). however, appending a butyryl
group at this position (n2-monobutyryl-cgmp) weakened affinity for the pde11 catalytic site by ⬃17-fold, suggesting
that despite the relative unimportance of n2 for substrate
interaction with the pde11 catalytic site, there are spatial
constraints in this region that could restrict inhibitor designs
using this position. appending a large aromatic phenyletheno group (pet-cgmp), which modifies both n1 and n2,
caused only a ⬃6-fold decrease in affinity for the cgmp
molecule; the effects of these cn analogs with modifications
of the pyrimidine ring of cgmp uniquely define features of
this region of the pde11 catalytic site.
importance of contacts and space at the ribose 2ⴕhydroxyl. deletion of the 2⬘-hydroxyl of cgmp (2⬘-deoxycgmp) diminished affinity only 1.6-fold, indicating that contact with this position was not particularly important in
interaction with the cgmp substrate. however, appending a
butyryl group at this position (2⬘-o-monobutyryl-cgmp) de-

pdes and catalytic products (5⬘-gmp or 5⬘-amp) contain these bonds (in pde11a4, gln-869 would be the contact amino acid), but cocrystal structure
of a pde with a cn has not been determined. in dual-specificity pdes such as pde11, the gln side chain is purportedly free to rotate to favorably
orient the oepsilon and nepsilon for interaction with substituents at c6 and n1 of either cgmp or camp. encircled question mark emphasizes the uncertainty

analogs were tested for potency in competing with cgmp.
n1-benzyl-cgmp, which contains a large hydrophobic substituent at n1, was only 1.8-fold weaker (ki ⫽ 0.61 ⫾ 0.13
␮m) (table 3) for inhibiting breakdown of [3h]cgmp than
cgmp. n1-methyl-cgmp (ki ⫽ 1.28 ⫾ 0.13 ␮m) was ⬃4-fold
less effective than unlabeled cgmp. the results provided
little support for a meaningful contact of the catalytic site
with the n1 of cgmp and countered the accepted interpretation that the side chain of the invariant gln forms a strong
bond with this position in the purine ring. in addition,
these results revealed considerable spatial tolerance for
substituents at this position and in the region extending
from n1 and n2.
realization of the importance of contact with n7 of cns in
some pde catalytic sites is longstanding (couchie et al.,
1983). to quantify the role of this position in pde11, n7 was
replaced with a carbon (7-deaza-cgmp). this compound had
16-fold lower affinity for the pde11 catalytic site (ki ⫽ 5.4 ⫾
2.0 ␮m) than did cgmp; the extent of the change in affinity
with this modification was similar to that found previously
with certain other pdes (couchie et al., 1983).
importance of the c6 oxygen of cgmp in affinity for
pde11 catalytic site. to assess the contribution of the c6
oxygen in cgmp to high affinity for the pde11 catalytic site,
2-amino- xxxd2705xxx  cyclic monophosphate was used. as
seen in table 3, this modification produced a dramatic drop
(82-fold) in affinity (ki ⫽ 28 ⫾ 6 ␮m). deletion of the c6
oxygen caused a 5-fold greater reduction in affinity for cgmp

than was observed in any of the other cn analogs; this
activity emphasized the critical importance of the group appended at c6 for high-affinity interaction.
importance of substitutions at c8. four analogs containing substitutions at c8 were tested and were entirely
ineffective up to 20 ␮m for inhibition of cgmp hydrolysis
(table 3). substitutions at c8 introduce bulk in this region,
which could sterically interfere with structures in the catalytic site. in addition, the bulk of these same substitutions
constrain rotation around the n9 ribosyl bond thereby favoring the syn conformation (fig. 1a) of the nucleotide, suggesting that cgmp is bound in the anti conformation (fig. 1c).
change in free energy of binding due to changes in
cgmp structure. the loss in energy of interaction between
pde11 catalytic site and various cns due to modifications in
the structure of the purine ring or groups appended to various positions of cgmp was calculated as described under
materials and methods. the ic50 value of each of the various
cn analogs compared to that of cgmp was used to calculate
the ⌬g, and these values were used to calculate the loss in
free energy of binding (⌬⌬g) due to modification of the cgmp
structure (table 3). modifications at the 2⬘-hydroxyl (2⬘-omonobutyryl-), n7 (7-deaza-), or n2 (n2-monobutyryl) caused
loss in free energy of binding of ⬃1.7 kcal/mol. the greatest
loss of free energy of binding (2.65 kcal/mol) was due to
deletion of the c6 carbonyl oxygen and was consistent with
loss of a single hydrogen bond (wilkinson et al., 1983; andrews et al., 1984).
evaluation of n1-methyl-cgmp as a substrate for
pde11. although n1-substituted cgmp analogs were potent
competitors for cgmp at the pde11 catalytic site, it was
important to assess whether the analog was positioned in the
site to allow for hydrolysis of the cyclic phosphate bond as
occurs with the natural substrate, cgmp. for this reason,
pde11 hydrolysis of n1-methyl-cgmp was tested as described under materials and methods. n1-methyl-cgmp was
hydrolyzed at approximately half the rate of hydrolysis of
cgmp (data not shown). the results supported the interpretation that interaction of cgmp, the natural substrate, and
n1-methyl cgmp with the pde11 catalytic site are similar.

discussion
pdes are prime targets for pharmacological intervention
in biological processes; consequently, members of this protein
superfamily have been the focus of major research efforts by
medicinal chemists in academia and the pharmaceutical industry. pde inhibitors (e.g., theophylline and  xxxd1914xxx )
have been used for years in myriad therapies, but the success
of potent and selective pde5 inhibitors in treatment of erectile dysfunction [sildenafil, tadalafil, and vardenafil] and pulmonary hypertension [sildenafil (revatio)] has renewed optimism that selective targeting of other pdes could yield
successful therapeutics in a variety of maladies. to this end,
there has been a major effort to determine the x-ray crystal
structures of the pdes to 1) map the topography of the
respective catalytic sites and 2) define contacts and constraints in interaction between these proteins and catalytic
site ligands such as inhibitors and substrates (wang et al.,
2005, 2007; zhang, 2006). appreciation of the role of certain
contacts and the spatial accommodations/restrictions around
positions in a cn or a structurally related inhibitor in deter-

mining the affinity with which pdes interact with ligands is
therefore of utmost importance.
to date, the x-ray crystal structures of pdes include only
those of isolated c domains, and there is currently no published structure for pde11. it has been demonstrated using
solution biochemistry that many of the kinetic characteristics of an isolated c domain can be quite similar to those of
the holoenzyme (fink et al., 1999; wang et al., 2006; weeks
et al., 2007). however, other characteristics of pde holoenzymes can influence contacts and potency of certain inhibitors (e.g., dimerization, phosphorylation, or additional structural features) (richter and conti, 2004; blount et al., 2006).
because these earlier reports demonstrated that significant
structural differences can exist between a pde holoenzyme
and its isolated c domain in solution, it seems equally plausible that contacts defined from an x-ray crystal structure of
an isolated c domain and certain ligands may not precisely
recapitulate those that occur in the holoenzyme. thus, for
development of the most accurate insights into the biochemical properties of interaction between pdes and ligands, it is
important to compare results derived from biochemical studies of pde11 holoenzyme in solution with insights and predictions derived from x-ray crystal structures of other pdes
(sung et al., 2003; zhang et al., 2004; blount et al., 2006).

in this report, we have used site-directed mutagenesis, cn
analogs, and pde inhibitors to define biochemical characteristics of the pde11 catalytic site; these are classic approaches that have been used fruitfully to characterize the
catalytic sites of many pdes (thomas et al., 1992; beltman
et al., 1995; butt et al., 1995; zoraghi et al., 2007). herein, we
demonstrate that invariant gln (gln-869) forms a critical

1992; beltman et al., 1995; butt et al., 1995; christensen et
al., 2003), but there are intrinsic limitations to the interpretation of the results of such studies. replacement of atoms
within the rings or appending substituents that vary in size
and/or chemical characteristics on the cn can uncover evidence for spatial constraints and direct binding contacts.
however, these same modifications can produce more global
changes in the cn chemistry including changes in the dipole
moment, alteration in electronegativity of particular positions, influences on hydrogen-bonding potential at various
points, and prevalence of the syn or anti conformer, thereby
affecting the affinity for a particular cn binding site (braumann et al., 1986; beltman et al., 1995; butt et al., 1995).
irrespective of these constraints, large changes in affinity
with a single modification such as that observed in this study
with the 2-amino- xxxd2705xxx  cyclic monophosphate are
likely to reflect the importance of a particular chemical component in the cn; this interpretation is further supported by
the results of site-directed mutagenesis of gln-869, which is
thought to contact this position, as well as by x-ray crystal
structures of a number of pdes. loss in affinity of the q869a
protein for substrates and tadalafil was specific because the
structural integrity of the q869a protein was verified by its
mobility of sds-page and the fact that maximal catalytic
activity and affinity for sildenafil were unchanged compared
with wt pde11a4.
these findings are of particular importance because, based
on results obtained from x-ray crystal structures of isolated
c domains in complex with ligands, it has become widely
accepted that the invariant gln side chain forms two critical

contact with cn substrates and tadalafil, which is energetically equivalent to a single hydrogen bond, that cgmp binds
to the pde11 catalytic site in the anti conformation, that the
c6 oxygen in cgmp forms a critical contact with pde11, that
the change in free energy of interaction upon deletion of this
oxygen is energetically equivalent to one hydrogen bond, and
that interaction between pde11 and n1 in cn is weak or
nonexistent. deletion of the c6 oxygen of cgmp caused a loss
in affinity that is at least a five times greater than the effects
of modification of other positions, and none of the latter
effects equates to the energy of a single hydrogen bond (2.5– 4
kcal/mol). change in affinity due to appending groups to n1
caused 22- to 46-fold lower effects than that observed after
deletion of the c6 oxygen. the results emphasize the importance of contact between pde11 catalytic site and this oxygen and argue against a hydrogen bond with n1. moreover,
spatial tolerance for groups appended at n1 indicates that
this position can be modified in efforts to improve inhibitor
potency or selectivity. based on our own work, including the
results reported herein, and that of others (thomas et al.,
1992; beltman et al., 1995; butt et al., 1995), there seems to
be no particular relationship between the selectivity of pde
catalytic sites for cn substrate(s) and the conformation (anti
or syn) of the cn that is preferred: pde1 (dual specificity)syn; pde2 (dual specificity)-syn;  xxxg1695xxx  (dual specificity)-anti;
pde4 (camp-specific)-anti; pd5 (cgmp-specific)-anti; pde6
(cgmp-specific)-syn; and pde11 (dual specificity)-anti.
use of cn analogs to map cn binding sites on a variety of
proteins has proved to be a highly useful tool (corbin and

hydrogen bonds with certain catalytic site ligands; (sung et
al., 2003; huai et al., 2004; wang et al., 2007). the combined
results of the studies reported herein are consistent with the
formation of a single hydrogen bond between the invariant
gln in pde11 and cn substrates and with the interpretation
that this hydrogen bond involves the c6 oxygen in cgmp.
the results also suggest that the moderately potent inhibitor,
tadalafil (but not the weak inhibitor, sildenafil), forms a
critical single hydrogen bond with gln-869 in the catalytic
site. the results with pde11 are in agreement with studies
of interaction between wt and mutated (q817a) pde5 with
cgmp, sildenafil, vardenafil, tadalafil,  xxxd2388xxx , or n1-substituted cgmp analogs, which suggested that the invariant gln
forms only one hydrogen bond with these ligands (francis et
al., 1990; thomas et al., 1992; zoraghi et al., 2007).
the affinities of the splice variants of pde11 (pde11a1a4) for cgmp and camp vary by ⬍4-fold, and affinities for
tadalafil vary ⬍5-fold (weeks et al., 2007); the magnitude of
these differences is less than that for one hydrogen bond in
any of the variants (wilkinson et al., 1983; andrews et al.,
1984). despite the 51% amino acid sequence identity between
the c domains of pde11 and pde5, there are significant
structural differences because 1) pde11 hydrolyzes camp
and cgmp equally well, whereas pde5 is highly cgmpselective, and 2) the potent pde5 inhibitor sildenafil is a
weak inhibitor of the pde11 splice variants (weeks et al.,
2007); the results presented herein suggest that the difference in potency of sildenafil for pde5 and pde11 may be
attributable in large part to the lack of contact between
sildenafil and gln-869 in pde11a4. thus, a novel structural
feature in the catalytic site of pde11 strongly discriminates
against optimal interaction with sildenafil. whether this feature also weakens interaction of the pde11 catalytic site
with vardenafil is not known. however, the calculated difference in free energy of binding of vardenafil to pde11, based
on potency of inhibition of pde11 (ic50 ⫽ 0.65 ␮m) compared
to potency of inhibition of pde5 (ic50 ⫽ 0.1– 0.4 nm), is
sufficient for at least one hydrogen bond (wilkinson et al.,
1983; andrews et al., 1984; blount et al., 2004; weeks et al.,
2007).
the results emphasize the importance of the invariant gln
in pde11 in determining affinity for substrates as well as for
inhibitors, and they quantify and define the contribution of
the invariant gln for interaction with catalytic site ligands.
spatial tolerance of the pde11 catalytic site for a large
hydrophobic group appended to n1 of cgmp suggests that
pde11 inhibitors containing a substituent in the analogous
position should be explored. in conclusion, the findings from
solution studies reported here reveal several novel features
of the pde11 catalytic site and provide insight into the
future development of selective inhibitors targeting this
poorly understood pde family.
