identification of the two missing bacterial genes involved in thiamine salvage: thiamine pyrophosphokinase and  xxxg2317xxx .  the genes encoding  xxxg2317xxx  in escherichia coli (ycfn) and thiamine pyrophosphokinase in bacillus subtilis (ylos) have been identified. this study completes the identification of the thiamine salvage enzymes in bacteria.
