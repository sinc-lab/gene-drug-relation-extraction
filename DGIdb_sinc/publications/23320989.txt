expert opinion

introduction:  xxxd443xxx  is an atypical antipsychotic in clinical development
for the treatment of schizophrenia and bipolar mania/mixed episodes.
areas covered: the purpose of this review is to describe the chemistry,
pharmacodynamic profile, pharmacokinetics, and clinical profile of  xxxd443xxx .
expert opinion:  xxxd443xxx  is a dopamine d3-preferring d3/ xxxg656xxx 
partial agonist. doses ‡ 1.5 mg/d yielded 69 -- 75% d2/ xxxg657xxx  occupancy
as measured in positron emission tomography scans. mean half-life for  xxxd443xxx  was 2 -- 5 d over a dose range of 1.5 -- 12.5 mg.  xxxd443xxx  produces
two clinically relevant metabolites: desmethyl- xxxd443xxx  and didesmethylcariprazine, the latter having a longer half-life than  xxxd443xxx . exposure to
didesmethyl- xxxd443xxx  exceeded that of the parent drug.  xxxd443xxx  is
metabolized by cyp3a4 and to a lesser extent by cyp2d6. the efficacy and
safety of  xxxd443xxx  have been so far investigated only in a few short-term
(unpublished) clinical trials; however, three studies in schizophrenia and three
studies in bipolar mania/mixed episodes evidenced a statistically significant
therapeutic effect compared to placebo for  xxxd443xxx  at doses ranging
from 1.5 to 12 mg/d. there does not appear to be clinically relevant adverse
effects of  xxxd443xxx  on metabolic variables. commonly encountered
adverse events associated with  xxxd443xxx  include insomnia, extrapyramidal
symptoms, akathisia, sedation, nausea, dizziness, and constipation.

introduction

schizophrenia and related disorders are relatively common chronic illnesses that are
challenging to treat effectively [1]. several different antipsychotic medications are
available, each with their own efficacy and tolerability profile [2]. in addition to psychotic disorders, many atypical (second-generation) antipsychotics have also
received regulatory approval for the treatment of bipolar disorder (usually for manic
episodes, but some have also received approval for maintenance treatment and two
for bipolar depression -- quetiapine monotherapy and olanzapine/fluoxetine
combination) [3]. three have also received approval in the us for adjunctive use
with antidepressants for the treatment of major depressive disorder [4].
 xxxd443xxx  is a new second-generation antipsychotic in late stage of clinical
development (box 1). the primary focus of this review is to describe the drug
metabolism and pharmacokinetic profile of  xxxd443xxx  and its clinical implications

pivotal trial(s)

one phase ii and two phase iii 6-week randomized controlled trials in acute
schizophrenia are positive for  xxxd443xxx  at all doses tested (1.5, 3.0, 4.5,
6.0, 3.0 -- 6.0, and 6.0 -- 9.0 mg/d). one phase ii and two phase iii 3-week
randomized controlled trials in bipolar mania/mixed episodes are positive for
 xxxd443xxx  at all doses tested (3 -- 6, 6 -- 12, and 3 -- 12 mg/d)

in the treatment of schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and major
depressive disorder. background information is provided
regarding chemistry, pharmacodynamics (with information
on dopamine (d) and serotonin (5-ht) receptor binding),
clinical efficacy, and safety/tolerability data. a pubmed search
was conducted on 31 october 2012 using the search terms
‘ xxxd443xxx ,’ ‘ xxxd443xxx ,’ and ‘ xxxd443xxx ’ without any date
or language restrictions. the resulting 15 publications [5-19]
and their reference lists were then specifically examined for
primary sources of information with emphasis on the drug
metabolism and pharmacokinetics of  xxxd443xxx  in humans.
query of www.clinicaltrials.gov on 31 october 2012 yielded
18 separate records (see table 1); however for the clinical trials
that were completed, study results were not posted. the
abstract books for the annual scientific meetings of the
american psychiatric association (2008 -- 2012), institute
on psychiatric services of the american psychiatric association (2008 -- 2012), new clinical drug evaluation unit
(2008 -- 2012), and american college of neuropsychopharmacology (2008 -- 2011) were also examined and yielded
five clinical trial reports (duplications excluded) [20-25]. not
all of these trials have been registered in www.clinicaltrials.
gov [20]. press releases from the manufacturer provided
additional information for trials not yet presented or
published [26-29]. the us patent for  xxxd443xxx  was filed on
20 january 2006 [30].

overview of the antipsychotic marketplace

there is no single antipsychotic that will be efficacious and
tolerable for every patient. in the us, among the first-line
second-generation antipsychotics, several are now available
as generic products -- risperidone, olanzapine, quetiapine (in
the immediate-release formulation), and ziprasidone. of
these, only ziprasidone is considered to be generally
194

‘metabolically friendly’ [31]. the other available secondgeneration antipsychotics are branded and relatively more
expensive, but represent additional treatment options and
have a smaller impact on weight and metabolic variables
than some of the older agents in the class. these
agents -- aripiprazole,  xxxd2830xxx ,  xxxd2330xxx , asenapine,
and  xxxd2518xxx  -- do differ in terms of dosing frequency,
need for titration to a therapeutic dose, drug--drug interactions, and commonly encountered adverse effects and are
thus not interchangeable [32].
all second-generation antipsychotics continue to have in
common dopamine d2 and serotonin  xxxg1113xxx 
affinity ( xxxd155xxx  being the exception). however, each of
these compounds has a unique pharmacodynamic profile
and involves consideration of a number of different dopamine, serotonin, noradrenergic, histaminergic, muscarinic,
and other types of receptors. in addition to potential differences in efficacy, it is believed that secondary receptor-binding
characteristics can also explain adverse effects including
sedation, weight gain, and orthostatic hypotension [33].
a special case is that of agents that have partial agonism at
the  xxxg656xxx  rather than pure antagonism. at present the
only available agent with this property is aripiprazole [34],
available as an oral tablet, oral disintegrating tablet, oral solution, and short-acting intramuscular injection [35], and
approved in the us for the treatment of schizophrenia, acute
treatment of manic or mixed episodes associated with bipolar
i disorder as monotherapy and as an adjunct to lithium or
valproate, maintenance treatment of bipolar i disorder, both
as monotherapy and as an adjunct to lithium or valproate,
adjunctive treatment of major depressive disorder, treatment
of irritability associated with autistic disorder, and the acute
treatment of agitation associated with schizophrenia or bipolar i disorder (injection only) [35]. in development is a depot
formulation of aripiprazole which may become available at

the time you read this [36]. also in the pipeline is another
d2 partial agonist,  xxxd365xxx  [32].
attempts are being made to identify other molecular
targets that would be helpful in the treatment of schizophrenia.
the most promising are those agents that impact on glutamate
receptors [37]. although results have been disappointing
and development halted for the metabotropic glutamate
receptor agonist pomaglumetad methionil [32], the glycine transport inhibitor bitopertin remains in phase iii of clinical
development [32].

introduction to  xxxd443xxx 

 xxxd443xxx  is a dopamine d3-preferring d3/ xxxg656xxx 
partial agonist and if commercialized would be the second
dopamine receptor partial agonist available. originally known
at  xxxd443xxx , the product was initially discovered by the
hungarian company gedeon richter ltd [30]. in november
2004, forest labs entered into a collaboration agreement to
develop and commercialize  xxxd443xxx  in the us and canada,
with gedeon richter retaining rights in the rest of the
world [14]. in may 2006,  xxxd443xxx  was licensed to
mitsubishi pharma corp for japanese and asian development
and commercialization [14].
4.

 xxxd443xxx  chemistry

 xxxd443xxx , 3-[4-[2-[4-(2,3-dichlorophenyl) xxxd2960xxx -1-yl]
ethyl]cyclohexyl]-1,1-dimethyl-urea (see also figure 1), was
discovered in the course of medicinal chemistry optimization
of an impurity leading to a new series of piperazine/piperidine
198

derivatives having high affinity to both dopamine d3 and d2
receptors [6]. of these compounds  xxxd443xxx  demonstrated
good absorption and brain penetration [6,18].
5.

 xxxd443xxx  pharmacodynamics

the in vitro receptor-binding profile of  xxxd443xxx  demonstrates
picomolar affinity for human dopamine d3 receptors (pki
10.07; ki 0.085 nm) and subnanomolar affinity for both d2l
and d2s subtypes of human d2 receptors (pki 9.31 and 9.16,
respectively; ki 0.49 nm and 0.69 nm, respectively), and human
5-ht2b receptors (pki 9.24; ki 0.58 nm) (from table 2 in
ref [17]). 5-ht2b receptors may have a role in controlling
dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens [38].
 xxxd443xxx  had nanomolar affinity for human 5-ht1a
receptors (pki 8.59; ki 3 nm), moderate to low affinity for
human 5-ht2a (pki 7.73; ki 19 nm), histamine h1 (pki
7.63; ki 23 nm), 5-ht7 (pki 6.95; 111 nm), and 5-ht2c
(pki 6.87; 134 nm) receptors, and it had low affinity for all
tested adrenergic receptors [17].
 xxxd443xxx  preference for rat d3 vs. d2 receptors was
similar to human receptors. the receptor-binding profile of
aripiprazole, assayed alongside  xxxd443xxx , differed; aripiprazole displayed highest affinity for both human dopamine
d2 subtypes and human 5-ht2b, followed by the human
histamine h1, dopamine d3, and human and rat 5-ht1a
receptors. moreover, aripiprazole exhibited higher affinity
than  xxxd443xxx  to rat striatal dopamine d2, human and rat
5-ht2a, 5-ht2c, and adrenergic receptors [17].
 xxxd443xxx  demonstrates partial agonism at dopamine
receptors, and in an in vitro assay measuring cyclic adenosine

 xxxd443xxx 

monophosphate production, intrinsic activity was relatively
high (emax 70.9%) [17]. activity of  xxxd443xxx  activity
in vivo is dependent on the functional status of the system;
 xxxd443xxx  is an antagonist in systems with normal dopaminergic activity, but is a partial agonist when dopaminergic
tone is reduced [14]. partial agonism was also present for
5-ht1a receptors using other assay techniques. activity at
5-ht2b receptors is that of pure antagonism [17].
when  xxxd443xxx  was compared with aripiprazole in the
functional assays for dopamine d2 and d3 receptors, similar
d2 and higher d3 antagonist-partial agonist affinity and a
3- to 10-fold greater d3 vs. d2 selectivity was observed for
 xxxd443xxx  [17].
the pharmacodynamic profile of  xxxd443xxx  was further
characterized using positron emission tomography (pet)
in monkeys [9], human volunteers [39], and persons with
schizophrenia [40,41]. in monkey brains,  xxxd443xxx  occupied
d2 and d3 receptors in a dose-dependent and saturable manner [9].  xxxg1108xxx  occupancy was considerably lower
compared with d2/d3 occupancy at the same doses [9]. in
healthy volunteers, single-dose  xxxd443xxx  of 0.5 mg occupied
up to 12% of striatal d2/d3 receptors, while striatal d2/d3
occupancy after multiple dosing up to  xxxd443xxx  1.0 mg/d
ranged from 63 to 79% [39]. in an open-label, fixed-dose,
2-week trial in eight males with schizophrenia, pet scans of
dorsal striatal regions (caudate nucleus and putamen) and
ventral striatum (nucleus accumbens) showed maximum
occupancy (‡ 90%) at a 3-mg target dose of  xxxd443xxx  following 14 d of treatment [40,41]. after 14 d of  xxxd443xxx 
1.5 mg/d, receptor occupancy was 69% in the caudate
nucleus, 69% in the nucleus accumbens, and 75% in the
putamen [40,41].

 xxxd443xxx  pharmacokinetics and
metabolism

6.

single- and multiple-dose pharmacokinetic studies of
 xxxd443xxx  and its active metabolites, desmethyl- xxxd443xxx 
and didesmethyl- xxxd443xxx , were conducted in healthy
male volunteers [42]. see also figure 1. single doses ranged
from 0.5 to 2.5 mg. the lowest multiple dose tested was
0.5 mg qod for 2 weeks and the highest multiple dose
tested was 1.0 mg qd for 3 weeks. in addition, the effect
of food on a single oral dose of 2.0 mg was also evaluated.
moderate inter-individual variability was noted for the pharmacokinetic parameters for  xxxd443xxx  and its metabolites.
after single dose administration, cmax for  xxxd443xxx  was
3 - 4 h under fasting conditions. food caused a slight delay
but had no significant effect on the extent of absorption.
the terminal disposition half-life was 5 -- 6 d. over the
single dose range of 0.5 -- 2.5 mg the  xxxd443xxx  plasma
concentration--time curves demonstrated dose proportionality
of exposure in terms of area under the curve (auc) but
greater than dose-proportional cmax. following multiple
administrations there was marked accumulation in plasma

concentrations for  xxxd443xxx  and its metabolites. steadystate plasma concentrations of  xxxd443xxx  were reached within
1 week. systemic exposure at steady-state circumstances was
dose proportional. the systemic exposure to the desmethylmetabolite was approximately 20 -- 30% of that to  xxxd443xxx 
and elimination of this metabolite was formation rate-limited.
however, elimination of didesmethyl- xxxd443xxx  was prolonged with an apparent terminal half-life of 2 - 3 weeks
and exposure to this metabolite was similar to, or exceeded,
the systemic exposure to  xxxd443xxx .
a similar pharmacokinetic profile is observed in persons
with schizophrenia [20,43]. in a double-blind trial with
escalating, multiple oral doses, male adult patients with
schizophrenia were randomized within each of eight cohorts
(six subjects each) to escalating doses of  xxxd443xxx 
0.5 -- 12.5 mg/d or placebo for 22 or 30 d [20,43]. there
was no evidence of a nonlinear dose relationship with
systemic exposure as measured by cmax and auc of
 xxxd443xxx  or its desmethyl and didesmethyl metabolites.
the mean half-life for  xxxd443xxx  was 2 -- 5 days over a
dose range of 1.5 -- 12.5 mg. systemic exposure to the
desmethyl- and didesmethyl- xxxd443xxx  was relatively low
compared with the parent drug on the first day of dosing
but on the last day of dosing with the 12.5 mg dose, systemic
exposure to didesmethyl- xxxd443xxx  relative to  xxxd443xxx 
was approximately three- and six-fold greater in terms of
auc (0 -- 24 h) and auc (0 -- 168 h), respectively. this
is consistent with the observation that didesmethylcariprazine has a longer elimination half-life than  xxxd443xxx 
itself. systemic exposure to desmethyl- xxxd443xxx  was
30 -- 40% of  xxxd443xxx , and was dose proportional. in
this study, attainment of steady state within the dosing
duration of 3 weeks was evidenced for  xxxd443xxx  and
desmethyl- xxxd443xxx , but not for didesmethyl- xxxd443xxx .
in vitro metabolism studies assessed the metabolic stability
of  xxxd443xxx  using liver microsomes of humans, monkeys,
dogs, rats, and mice, explored enzyme induction and inhibition potencies of  xxxd443xxx  using human liver microsomes
and/or hepatocyte cultures, determined the human cyp
isozyme profile of  xxxd443xxx  by recombinant systems, compared in vitro the metabolite profile of the compound in
different species, and identified the structure of detected
metabolites [44]. methods for the quantification of  xxxd443xxx 
and its active metabolites, desmethyl- and didesmethylcariprazine in human plasma and urine, have been published [19].  xxxd443xxx  demonstrated high metabolic stability
for each investigated species. it was characterized as a weak
competitive inhibitor of human cyp2d6 and cyp3a4
isozymes.  xxxd443xxx  did not induce cyp3a4 and cyp1a2
in human hepatocytes. the drug was metabolized by
cyp3a4 and to a lesser extent by cyp2d6 [44]. further information on the metabolism of the principal metabolites was
not found.
further studies and analyses, including pharmacokinetic
modeling for  xxxd443xxx , are anticipated.

 xxxd443xxx  clinical trials

overview
data from randomized controlled trials regarding subjects with
schizophrenia have been reported in one phase i study [20], two
phase ii studies [21,22] and one open-label extension [23] and two
phase iii studies [29]. data from randomized controlled trials
regarding subjects with bipolar mania/mixed episodes have
been reported in one phase ii study [24] and two phase iii
studies [25,26]. data from randomized controlled trials regarding
subjects with bipolar depression have been reported in one
phase ii study [27]. data from randomized controlled trials
regarding subjects with major depressive disorder have been
reported in one phase ii study [28]. all of these reports are either
abstracts/posters presented at scientific meetings [20-25], or press
releases from the manufacturer [26-29]. none have yet been
published in a peer-reviewed scientific journal. at least two
studies in subjects with schizophrenia and at least two studies
in subjects with bipolar mania/mixed episodes were positive
for  xxxd443xxx , enabling potential commercialization for these
two indications at this time.

schizophrenia
in a phase i pharmacokinetic study of 43 adults with schizophrenia (positive and negative syndrome scale (panss)
positive subscale score £ 21) randomized within each of
8 cohorts to  xxxd443xxx  0.5 -- 12.5 mg/d, or placebo, treatment was completed by 12 (75%) of 16 placebo patients
and 27 (59%) of 46  xxxd443xxx  patients. the cohorts varied
with regard to dosing schedule and treatment duration, and
pharmacokinetic sampling occurred through 37 d of doubleblind dosing. efficacy information is not available. adverse
events led to discontinuation of three (19%) placebo and
five (11%)  xxxd443xxx  patients [20].
in the first reported phase ii trial, 389 adults with an
acute exacerbation of schizophrenia were randomized to
receive up to 6 weeks of double-blinded  xxxd443xxx  low
dose (1.5 -- 4.5 mg/d; n = 128),  xxxd443xxx  high dose
(6 -- 12 mg/d; n = 134), or placebo (n = 130) [21]. mean baseline panss score was 95 and patients were required to be
hospitalized during screening and the first 3 weeks of
double-blind treatment. for each group, 54% of patients
completed treatment. the change from baseline to week
6 in panss total score was -9.7, -14.5, and -12.6 for the
placebo,  xxxd443xxx  low-dose, and high-dose groups, respectively (last observation carried forward (locf)). pairwise
comparison between the low-dose group and placebo was
statistically significant (p = 0.033); for the high-dose group
vs. placebo, p = 0.2. for the panss negative subscale,
pairwise comparisons yielded significant improvements
(p < 0.05) in the  xxxd443xxx  low-dose group at week 1 and
continued to week 6. adverse events leading to discontinuation were 15, 9, and 8% for placebo, low-dose, and
high-dose groups, respectively, primarily worsening of schizophrenia. there were no clinically meaningful changes in
7.2

metabolic parameters, including mean fasting serum glucose
and serum lipid levels and the prolactin level.
in a second phase ii trial, 732 adults with acute schizophrenia were randomized to 6 weeks of double-blind treatment
with fixed doses of  xxxd443xxx  1.5 (n = 145), 3.0 (n = 147),
or 4.5 mg/d (n = 148), risperidone 4.0 mg/d (n = 141), or placebo (n = 151) [22]. mean baseline panss was approximately
97 -- 98. of the randomized patients, 64% completed the study.
improvement in panss total score at week 6 was greater for
 xxxd443xxx  1.5, 3.0, and 4.5 mg/d vs. placebo (p < 0.001;
locf), with placebo-adjusted improvements of -7.5, -8.9,
and -10.4, respectively, and -15 for risperidone as measured
from figure 1 in ref [22]. statistically significant improvements
were observed for each  xxxd443xxx  group relative to placebo in
clinical global impressions-severity (cgi-s) scores, panss
positive subscale scores (1.5 mg/d, p = 0.0057; 3.0 and
4.5 mg/d, p < 0.0001), and panss negative subscale scores
(p < 0.0001, all doses). statistically significant differences
(p < 0.0001) were also noted for risperidone vs. placebo in
panss total score, cgi-s score, and panss subscales. the
most common adverse events in the  xxxd443xxx  groups
were insomnia, extrapyramidal symptoms (eps), akathisia,
sedation, nausea, dizziness, and constipation, and the incidence
was not dose proportional. discontinuation rates due to
adverse events were 15% for placebo, 10, 5, and 8% for  xxxd443xxx  1.5, 3.0, and 4.5 mg/d, respectively, and 9% for risperidone 4.0 mg/d. eps-related adverse event incidence was 13%
for placebo, 21, 22, and 22% for  xxxd443xxx  1.5, 3.0, and
4.5 mg/d, respectively, and 29% for risperidone 4.0 mg/d.
potentially clinically significant weight increase (> 7%) was
greater for risperidone (16.7%) than  xxxd443xxx  (8.5, 10.7,
and 4.9% for 1.5, 3.0, and 4.5 mg/d, respectively) or placebo (2%). no clinically relevant changes were noted for  xxxd443xxx  on metabolic variables, prolactin levels, or the ecg
qt interval. a 48-week extension study has also been
reported [23]. subjects in the extension were required to have
completed the 6-week randomized trial [22] and have achieved
a cgi-s score of 3 or better and a 20% or better reduction in
panss total score at end point of the lead-in study. subjects
in the extension received open-label treatment with flexibledose  xxxd443xxx  1.5 -- 4.5 mg/d. a total of 93 patients entered
the open-label extension study and received  xxxd443xxx ;
49.5% completed 48 weeks of open-label treatment with
 xxxd443xxx , with a mean duration of treatment of 222 d.
panss and cgi-s scores decreased over the course of the
study. serious adverse events were reported in 12.9% of patients
including one death (suicide), worsening of schizophrenia
(4.3%), and psychotic disorder (2.2%). treatment-emergent
adverse events reported in at least 10% of patients were
akathisia (14.0%), insomnia (14.0%), and weight increase
(11.8%). mean changes in clinical laboratory values, blood
pressure and pulse rate, and ecg parameters were small. no
patients had a qtc increase > 60 ms. the incidence of
treatment-emergent parkinsonism was 8.6% and the incidence
of treatment-emergent akathisia was 17.2%, as measured by

rating scales. no patient discontinued because of movement
disorder adverse events.
two subsequent positive phase iii trials in acute schizophrenia have been announced in a press release [29]. in the
fixed-dose study, 617 adults were randomized to receive
double-blinded  xxxd443xxx  3 mg/d,  xxxd443xxx  6 mg/d, aripiprazole 10 mg/d, or placebo, for 6 weeks [29]. patients were
required to be hospitalized during the washout period and for
the first 4 weeks of the double-blind treatment. statistically significant improvement in panss total score was observed in
each of the  xxxd443xxx  dose groups relative to the placebo treatment group (3 mg/d: -6.0, p = 0.0044; and 6 mg/d: -8.8,
p < 0.0001) by mixed models for repeated measures
(mmrm) analysis. the change from baseline in panss total
score was statistically significant at every time point starting at
week 1 for the  xxxd443xxx  6 mg/d group and week 3 onwards
for the  xxxd443xxx  3 mg/d group. statistically significant
improvements were also seen in the aripiprazole group relative
to placebo in the panss total score at each week. overall, 67%
of patients completed the study. the premature discontinuation rates (all causes, including adverse-event related) were
33% for  xxxd443xxx  3 mg/d, 38% for  xxxd443xxx  6 mg/d,
25% for aripiprazole 10 mg/d, and 38% for placebo. the
most common adverse events (‡ 10%) observed in any
treatment group were akathisia, insomnia, and headache.
in the fixed-flexible dose study, 446 adults were randomized to receive  xxxd443xxx  3 -- 6 mg/d,  xxxd443xxx 
6 -- 9 mg/d, or placebo, for 6 weeks [29]. patients were required
to be hospitalized during the washout period and for the first
4 weeks of the double-blind treatment. statistically significant
improvement in panss total score was observed in each of
the  xxxd443xxx  dose groups relative to the placebo treatment
group (3 -- 6 mg/d: -6.8, p = 0.0029; and 6 -- 9 mg/d: -9.9,
p < 0.0001) by mmrm analysis. the change from baseline
was statistically significant at every time point starting at
week 1 for the  xxxd443xxx  6 -- 9 mg/d group and week
2 onward for the  xxxd443xxx  3 -- 6 mg/d group. overall,
61% of patients completed the study. the premature discontinuation rates (all causes, including adverse-event related)
were 36% for  xxxd443xxx  3 -- 6 mg/d, 42% for  xxxd443xxx 
6 -- 9 mg/d, and 40% for placebo. the most common adverse
events (‡ 10%) observed in any treatment group were
akathisia, headache, insomnia, restlessness, and eps.
bipolar disorder
in a phase ii, 3-week, randomized controlled trial, 238 adults
with acute mania/mixed episode associated with bipolar i
disorder received flexibly dosed  xxxd443xxx  3 -- 12 mg/d or
placebo [24]. a total of 61.9% placebo and 63.6%  xxxd443xxx 
patients completed the study. baseline young mania
rating scale (ymrs) scores were approximately 30 -- 31.
 xxxd443xxx  significantly reduced ymrs scores vs. placebo
at week 3 (adjusted mean difference (95% confidence interval) = -6.12 (-8.91, -3.32); p < 0.0001; locf); sensitivity
analyses using observed cases and mmrm approaches yielded
7.3

similar results. change from baseline at week 3 in each
ymrs item was significantly greater for  xxxd443xxx  vs. placebo (locf). ymrs responders (50% reduction, locf)
were 48% for  xxxd443xxx  vs. 25% for placebo (number
needed to treat (nnt) 5). ymrs remitters (total
score £ 12, locf) were 42% for  xxxd443xxx  vs. 23% for placebo (nnt 6). serious adverse events were reported for five
(4%) placebo and four (3%)  xxxd443xxx  patients. the most
common adverse events (> 10% for  xxxd443xxx ) were eps,
headache, akathisia, constipation, nausea, and dyspepsia.
in a subsequent phase iii study, 312 adults with acute mania/
mixed episode associated with bipolar i disorder were randomized to flexibly dosed  xxxd443xxx  3 -- 12 mg/d or placebo
for 3 weeks of double-blind treatment [25]. patients were
required to be hospitalized for a 4 -- 7-d washout/
screening and for at least 14 d of treatment. a total of 69 and
68% of placebo and  xxxd443xxx  patients, respectively, completed the study. baseline ymrs scores were approximately
32. statistically significant improvement was demonstrated in
 xxxd443xxx  3 -- 12 mg/d patients relative to placebo on ymrs
(least-squared mean difference (lsmd) = =4.3; p < 0.001;
mmrm) and cgi-s (lsmd = -0.4; p < 0.01; mmrm)
change from baseline to week 3. ymrs responders were
59% for  xxxd443xxx  vs. 44% for placebo (nnt 7). ymrs
remitters were 52% for  xxxd443xxx  vs. 35% for placebo
(nnt 6). overall premature discontinuation rates were similar
for  xxxd443xxx  and placebo patients (32 and 31%). the most
common adverse events (‡ 10% and twice the rate of placebo)
were akathisia, eps, tremor, dyspepsia, and vomiting; 10% of
 xxxd443xxx - and 7% of placebo-treated patients discontinued
due to adverse events. eps-related adverse events occurred in
50 and 12% of  xxxd443xxx  and placebo patients, respectively.
announced in a press release are the results from a second
positive phase iii trial [26]. in this study, 497 adults with acute
mania associated with bipolar i disorder were randomized to
receive  xxxd443xxx  3 -- 6 mg/d,  xxxd443xxx  6 -- 12 mg/d,
or placebo, for 3 weeks. patients were required to be hospitalized throughout screening and for at least the first 14 d
following initiation of treatment. statistically significant
improvement on the ymrs was noted in both  xxxd443xxx 
dose groups (3 -- 6 mg/d: -6.1 points, p < 0.001; and
6 -- 12 mg/d: -5.9 points, p < 0.001) relative to patients receiving placebo (mmrm). overall premature discontinuation
rates (all causes, including adverse-event related) were 23%
for  xxxd443xxx  3 -- 6 mg/d, 30%  xxxd443xxx  6 -- 12 mg/d,
and 24% for placebo. the most common adverse events
(greater than or equal to 10% and twice the rate of placebo)
observed in the study were akathisia (both  xxxd443xxx  groups)
and constipation ( xxxd443xxx  6 -- 12 mg/d). discontinuations
due to adverse events were observed in 9% of patients for the
 xxxd443xxx  3 -- 6 mg/d, 15% for the  xxxd443xxx  6 -- 12 mg/d,
and 5% for the placebo group.
also announced in a press release are negative results from
a phase ii study in 233 adults with bipolar depression [27]. subjects were randomized to 8 weeks of treatment with flexibly

dosed  xxxd443xxx  0.25 -- 0.75 mg/d,  xxxd443xxx  1.5 -- 3.0 mg/d,
or placebo. the primary endpoint was the montgomery asberg
depression rating scale (madrs) score. the overall difference observed between the drug-treated and placebo-treated
groups was not statistically significant; however, over the course
of the trial there was evidence of a clinically relevant treatment
effect in the high-dose arm of the study by comparison to
placebo. approximately 9% of patients discontinued the
study early due to adverse events in the high-dose study arm
compared to 3% in the placebo arm.
major depressive disorder
announced in a press release are the results of a negative
phase ii study in 231 adults with major depressive disorder
who have failed to respond to at least 2 antidepressant therapies [28]. subjects on antidepressant therapy were randomized
to receive adjunctive  xxxd443xxx  0.1 -- 0.3 mg/d, adjunctive
 xxxd443xxx  1.0 -- 2.0 mg/d, or adjunctive placebo, for 8 weeks.
the primary endpoint was the madrs score. the overall
difference observed between the drug-treated and placebotreated groups was not statistically significant. approximately
3% of patients discontinued the study early due to adverse
events in the high-dose and 1% in the low-dose study arm
compared to 3% in the placebo arm.

8.  xxxd443xxx  safety and tolerability
overview

clinical trials. for example, in one of the phase iii studies,
eps-related adverse events occurred in 50 and 12% of  xxxd443xxx  and placebo patients, respectively [25], for an  xxxd669xxx 
vs. placebo of 3. in that study, treatment-emergent akathisia
was observed in 22.8% of subjects randomized to  xxxd443xxx 
vs. 4.5% for placebo ( xxxd669xxx  6); treatment-emergent eps was
observed in 15.2% of  xxxd443xxx -treated subjects vs. 1.9% for
placebo ( xxxd669xxx  8). similar results were reported for a phase ii
study of bipolar mania [24], where 24.6% of cariprazinetreated subjects exhibited eps vs. 9.3% for placebo ( xxxd669xxx 
7); 18.6% of  xxxd443xxx -treated subjects exhibited akathisia
vs. 5.9% for placebo ( xxxd669xxx  8).

regulatory affairs

the studies necessary to garner regulatory approval in the us
for  xxxd443xxx  for the acute indications of schizophrenia and
bipolar mania/mixed episodes have been completed. a new
drug application for these indications was submitted to the
us food and drug administration, as announced on
28 november 2012 [45]. a phase iii study for relapse prevention in schizophrenia is ongoing (table 1). although the
initial phase ii studies for bipolar depression and for adjunctive use in persons with major depressive disorder were
reported as negative [27,28], additional phase ii or iii studies
for these potential indications are ongoing (table 1).
10.

where available, safety and tolerability data have been
described in the prior section. there does not appear to be
clinically relevant adverse effects of  xxxd443xxx  on metabolic
variables, prolactin, or the ecg qt interval. in one of
the 6-week phase ii trials in subjects with schizophrenia, the
most common adverse events in the  xxxd443xxx  groups were
insomnia, eps, akathisia, sedation, nausea, dizziness, and
constipation [22]. eps-related adverse event incidence was
13% for placebo, 21, 22, and 22% for  xxxd443xxx  1.5, 3.0,
and 4.5 mg/d, respectively, and 29% for risperidone
4.0 mg/d, resulting in number needed to harm ( xxxd669xxx ) values
vs. placebo of 12 or 13 for  xxxd443xxx  and 7 for risperidone.
akathisia was observed in 5% of subjects receiving placebo,
9, 10, and 8% for  xxxd443xxx  1.5, 3.0, and 4.5 mg/d, respectively, and 9% for risperidone 4.0 mg/d, resulting in  xxxd669xxx 
values vs. placebo of 20 -- 34 for  xxxd443xxx  and 25 for risperidone. potentially clinically significant weight increase (> 7%)
was greater for risperidone (16.7%) than  xxxd443xxx  (8.5,
10.7, and 4.9% for 1.5, 3.0, and 4.5 mg/d, respectively)
or placebo (2%), resulting in  xxxd669xxx  values vs. placebo of
12 -- 35 for  xxxd443xxx  and 7 for risperidone. safety and tolerability results of a 48-week extension study were consistent
with the short-term study [23]. the top-line safety and tolerability results from the phase iii studies in schizophrenia did
not raise any new safety or tolerability concerns [29].
subjects with bipolar mania receiving  xxxd443xxx  exhibited
greater rates of eps than the subjects in the schizophrenia

conclusion

 xxxd443xxx  is a dopamine d3-preferring d3/ xxxg656xxx 
partial agonist and if commercialized would be the second
dopamine receptor partial agonist available. when  xxxd443xxx 
was compared with aripiprazole in functional assays for dopamine d2 and d3 receptors, similar d2 and higher d3
antagonist-partial agonist affinity and a 3- to 10-fold greater
d3 vs. d2 selectivity was observed for  xxxd443xxx .  xxxd443xxx  has also high affinity for 5-ht2b receptors (antagonist)
and is a partial agonist at 5-ht1a receptors. doses of at least
1.5 mg/d in subjects with schizophrenia yielded 69 -- 75%
d2/ xxxg657xxx  occupancy as measured in pet scans,
with ‡ 90% occupancy with a 3 mg target dose.
mean half-life for  xxxd443xxx  in subjects with schizophrenia
was 2 -- 5 d over a dose range of 1.5 -- 12.5 mg. there was no
evidence of a nonlinear dose relationship with systemic exposure as measured by cmax and auc of  xxxd443xxx  or its active
desmethyl and didesmethyl metabolites. systemic exposure
to desmethyl- xxxd443xxx  was 30 -- 40% of  xxxd443xxx , and
was dose proportional. the half-life of didesmethyl- xxxd443xxx 
is substantially longer than that of  xxxd443xxx , with a three to
six-fold greater exposure vs.  xxxd443xxx  as measured by auc
over 24 and 168 h, respectively.  xxxd443xxx  is metabolized by
cyp3a4 and to a lesser extent by cyp2d6.
results of four phase ii or iii 6-week randomized controlled trials in acute schizophrenia are available, in which
three studies are positive for  xxxd443xxx  at all doses tested

 xxxd443xxx 

(1.5, 3.0, 4.5, 6.0, 3.0 -- 6.0, and 6.0 -- 9.0 mg/d). results of
three phase ii or iii 3-week randomized controlled trials in
bipolar mania/mixed episodes are available, all positive for
 xxxd443xxx  at all doses tested (3 -- 6, 6 -- 12, and 3 -- 12 mg/
d). preliminary phase ii trials of  xxxd443xxx  for bipolar
depression or as an adjunct to antidepressant therapy in major
depressive disorder have been negative but other phase ii and
iii trials are ongoing for these indications as well as for prevention of relapse in schizophrenia.
there does not appear to be clinically relevant adverse
effects of  xxxd443xxx  on metabolic variables, prolactin, or
the ecg qt interval. commonly encountered adverse events
associated with  xxxd443xxx  include insomnia, eps, akathisia,
sedation, nausea, dizziness, and constipation. subjects with
bipolar mania exhibited greater rates of eps and akathisia.
further characterization of the comparative effectiveness of
 xxxd443xxx  with other antipsychotics for the treatment of
schizophrenia or bipolar disorder awaits the conduct of
appropriately designed clinical trials.

expert opinion

 xxxd443xxx  represents a new treatment option for schizophrenia
and bipolar mania, and holds promise as a treatment for bipolar
depression and as an adjunct to antidepressants for the treatment
of major depressive disorder. although similar to aripiprazole
regarding dopamine receptor partial agonism, it differs from aripiprazole regarding affinity to the  xxxg657xxx  and in
terms of secondary receptor-binding characteristics. whether
targeting the  xxxg657xxx  over the dopamine
 xxxg656xxx  is clinically advantageous in the treatment of
schizophrenia or mood disorders remains unknown. the
 xxxg657xxx  is an autoreceptor that controls the phasic, but
not tonic, activity of dopamine neurons and mediates behavioral
abnormalities elicited by glutamate/n-methyl-d-aspartate
receptor blockade [46]. theoretically, dopamine d3 preferring
agents may exert pro-cognitive effects, as evidenced in animal
studies [5,8]. serotonin 5-ht1a partial agonism, a property
 xxxd443xxx  also shares with aripiprazole and  xxxd2518xxx , is also
thought to possibly benefit negative symptoms and cognitive
deficits as evidenced in preclinical studies [11,15].
 xxxd443xxx  would be an alternative to aripiprazole in the
absence of other available dopamine receptor partial agonists.
it would be of interest to compare  xxxd443xxx  directly with
aripiprazole in a randomized controlled trial designed specifically for this; the registration trial that included aripiprazole
10 mg/d as an active control for assay sensitivity may or
may not be adequately informative regarding potential clinically relevant differences between  xxxd443xxx  and aripiprazole
in efficacy or tolerability [29].
when aripiprazole becomes available as a generic product,
differentiation will become more important as cost differences
will likely be large between branded  xxxd443xxx  and generic
aripiprazole. the availability of a long-acting injectable

formulation of aripiprazole may also factor into clinicaldecision making. additional formulations of  xxxd443xxx ,
including an oral solution, oral disintegrating tablet, and
short- and long-acting intramuscular injections, would allow
broader use, as would additional indications that are already
presently available for aripiprazole.
further characterization of didesmethyl- xxxd443xxx  is
important as its terminal half-life of 2 - 3 weeks results in substantial exposure to this metabolite. this may allow for the
development of a once-weekly oral formulation. this may be
quite attractive to patients and their families and would possibly improve medication adherence. a once-weekly oral formulation would potentially be an alternative to intramuscular
injection of depot formulations of antipsychotics.
because  xxxd443xxx  is primarily metabolized through
cyp3a4, it would be anticipated that potent cyp3a4
inducers, such as carbamazepine, or potent cyp3a4 inhibitors, such as ketoconazole, may impact the plasma levels of
 xxxd443xxx  and its metabolites. drug--drug interaction studies
have not yet been reported for  xxxd443xxx .
because the registration trials enrolled carefully selected subjects who were able to provide informed consent and were free
of significant comorbid psychiatric and medical conditions,
patients in ‘real-world’ clinical practice may be dissimilar and
the information about dosing, efficacy, and tolerability from
the pivotal studies may not necessarily be generalizable to a
more difficult-to-treat patient population. higher doses may
be necessary, incurring additional tolerability burdens.
there remains confusion in the literature on the characterization of drugs that elicit markedly different intrinsic activities at functions mediated by a single receptor. the term
‘receptor functional selectivity’ is preferred over others and is
a more accurate reflection of mechanism of action than simply
‘partial agonism’ [47,48].
caution should be exercised when interpreting the clinical
trial results as presented in posters and press releases as they
may represent preliminary results and may differ from what is
eventually published in a peer-reviewed study report. moreover,
the clinical data presented here are incomplete -- although
several clinical trials have been done, their results are not yet
publicly available. if commercialized in the us, the food and
drug administration will make available the drug approval
package, which typically contains comprehensive analyses of
preclinical and clinical data [49].
