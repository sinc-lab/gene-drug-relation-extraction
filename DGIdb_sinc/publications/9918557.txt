 xxxd94xxx  selectively blocks the n-methyl-d-aspartate subclass of  xxxg981xxx  channels in rat hippocampal neurons.  we investigated in rat hippocampus neurons whether 4-(aminobutyl)guanidine ( xxxd94xxx ), formed by decarboxylation of l-arginine by  xxxg232xxx  and metabolized to urea and putrescine, can modulate the function of n-methyl-d-aspartate (nmda) receptor channels. in cultured hippocampal neurons studied by whole-cell patch clamp, extracellular-applied  xxxd94xxx  produced a voltage- and concentration-dependent block of nmda but not alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid nor kainate currents. analysis of the voltage dependence of the block suggests that  xxxd94xxx  binds at a site located within the nmda channel pore with a dissociation constant of 952 microm at 0 mv and an electric distance of 0.62. we also tested effects of several  xxxd94xxx  analogs. arcaine (1,4-butyldiguanidine) also produced a similar voltage-dependent block of the nmda current, whereas putrescine (1, 4-butyldiamine) had little effect, suggesting that the guanidine group of  xxxd94xxx  is the active moiety when blocking the nmda channel. moreover,  xxxd3234xxx  (an endogenous polyamine) potentiated the nmda current even in the presence of blocker  xxxd94xxx  or arcaine, suggesting that the guanidine-containing compounds  xxxd94xxx  and arcaine interact with the nmda channel at a binding site different from that of  xxxd3234xxx . our results indicate that in hippocampal neurons  xxxd94xxx  selectively modulates the nmda subclass of  xxxg981xxx  channels mediated by the interaction between the guanidine group and the channel pore. the results support other data that  xxxd94xxx  may function as an endogenous neurotransmitter/neuromodulator in brain.
