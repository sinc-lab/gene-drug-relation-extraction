abstract — excess activation of glutamatergic neurotransmission in the cerebral cortex following ethanol withdrawal is considered to
contribute to significant behavioural disturbances, and to alcohol craving. astrocytes may play a role in these manifestations because
astrocytes are essential in the regulation of released glutamate and its conversion to glutamine through the enzyme  xxxg913xxx 
(gs). however, it is unclear if withdrawal from free-choice ethanol drinking causes changes in the numbers of astrocytes expressing gs
or the cytoskeletal protein of astrocytes  xxxg883xxx  (gfap). alcohol-preferring (p) rats exposed to free-choice ethanol
drinking were either maintained without forced interruption of ethanol drinking, subjected to a 3-day withdrawal period at the end of
2 months, or subjected to three 3-day withdrawal periods along 6 months. at 2 months, p rats were also compared with alcohol-naı̈ve
alcohol non-preferring rats (np) rats. packing density of gs and gfap-immunoreactive (ir) astrocytes was measured in sections from
the prelimbic cortex (plc) using the optical disector probe. an alcohol deprivation effect was observed in p rats with withdrawals
during a 6-month ethanol drinking period. ethanol withdrawal significantly increased the packing density of gs- and gfap-ir
astrocytes in the plc of p rats as compared with p rats with continuous access to ethanol. in addition, there was a positive correlation
between the pre-withdrawal ethanol consumption and the packing density of gs-ir astrocytes. the present results suggest the involvement of astrocytes in the regulation of the glutamatergic activation associated with withdrawal from free-choice ethanol consumption
and point to differential adaptations of gs and gfap to prolonged alcohol drinking in the plc of p rats.

(norenberg and martinez-hernandez, 1979; hallermayer and
hamprecht, 1984; hertz and zielke, 2004). glutamine is then
transferred to neurons, where it is converted into glutamate
once again. astrocytes expressing gs are thus a crucial
element in ensuring the rapid recycling of taken-up glutamate
for its use in synaptic transmission, and are likely to contribute
critically to the regulation of glutamatergic excitation during
and after ethanol deprivation.
in culture, ethanol exposure produces a reduction in
gs activity (davies and vernadakis, 1984). ethanol by itself
inhibits the proliferation of astrocytes in culture (kane et al.,
1996). in addition, the extracellular levels of glutamate affect
the activity and the expression of astrocytic gs
(tiffany-castiglioni et al., 1989; mearow et al., 1990; rauen
and wiessner, 2000; shen et al., 2004). since astrocytes are
the origin of gs involved in the conversion of glutamate to
glutamine, changes in the packing density of gs containing
astrocytes may influence the regulation of glutamate conversion and eventually the levels of excitation in the surrounding
neuropil. the packing density of astrocytes in cortex might
also influence the ability to limit the effects of excess
activation of glutamate receptors. in adult alcohol-preferring
(p) rats, a line of rats from indiana university that become
dependent on alcohol even when offered a free-choice
between water and aqueous ethanol solutions (mcbride and
li, 1998; rodd et al., 2004), the packing density of
glial-fibrillary-acidic-protein immunoreactive (gfap-ir)astrocytes in the prelimbic cortex is significantly lower than
in alcohol non-preferring (np) or in wistar rats (miguelhidalgo, 2005) and it is possible that this is paralleled by a
lower packing density of gs-ir astrocytes. in addition, given
the involvement of gs-ir astrocytes in the regulation of the
perisynaptic glutamatergic cycle, withdrawal may affect the
density of gs-ir astrocytes in the prelimbic cortex of p rats,
a cortical area with strong connections to subcortical nuclei

withdrawal from prolonged intake of alcoholic beverages
results in increased excitation of cortical and subcortical
neurons (de witte et al., 2003). this excitation has been proposed to contribute importantly to the behavioural and motor
pathology that accompanies withdrawal from ethanol drinking. various lines of evidence support that this increased
excitation is mediated by excess glutamatergic activation
brought about by upregulation of glutamate receptors induced
during the period of prolonged ethanol consumption
(tsai, 1998). another effect related to withdrawal from
alcohol drinking is the alcohol deprivation effect (ade), a
temporary increase (as compared with the pre-withdrawal period) in alcohol intake after a period of alcohol deprivation
(rodd et al., 2004). some lines of evidence also implicate
altered glutamatergic neurotransmission in the manifestations
of ade (backstrom et al., 2004; schroeder et al., 2005;
vengeliene et al., 2005).
the effects of ethanol intake on glutamatergic neurotransmission are not limited to changes in the abundance of
glutamate receptors. alcohol also causes changes in presynaptic terminals that eventually result in increased levels of
glutamate release during withdrawal from alcohol (dahchour
and de witte, 1999; rossetti et al., 1999). the levels of
released glutamate in the extracellular compartment are
tightly regulated by astrocytes (anderson and swanson,
2000; gadea and lopez-colome, 2001). in order for glutamate
to be reused by neurons, astrocytes rapidly convert glutamate
into glutamine by the action of  xxxg913xxx  (gs)

heavily involved in the regulation of responses to reward
stimuli and substances of abuse (pinto and sesack, 2000;
killcross and coutureau, 2003; zavala et al., 2003; kalivas
et al., 2005).
the present study aimed to ascertain whether withdrawal
from free-choice alcohol drinking in p rats is associated with
changes in the packing density of gs and gfapimmunoreactive astrocytes and whether those changes
correlated with the amount of alcohol consumed before
the withdrawal period. we also sought to ascertain whether
the packing density of gs-immunoreactive astrocytes was
lower in p rats than in alcohol-naı̈ve np rats.

materials and methods

packing density packing density of gs and gfapimmunoreactive astrocytes was measured in three sections
per immunostaining procedure under a microscope with a
40· objective with 1.3 numerical aperture. the counting procedure involved a motorized stage and the use of the stereo
investigator software (microbrightfield, inc.) according to
the method described in miguel-hidalgo (2005). the technician counting cells worked with coded slides and was blind
both to the group and the actual animal identification. to
obtain an estimate of the packing density of gs-ir or
gfap-ir astrocytes in each of the three sections per brain,
the total number of gs-ir or gfap-ir astrocytes counted
was divided into the total volume of the counting frames
sampled. values of packing density in the three sections
were averaged and the averages taken as values of the packing
density variable used for statistical comparisons.

animals
inbred alcohol-preferring (p) rats in the 40th and 41st generations and inbred alcohol non-preferring (np) rats in the 44th
generation from the alcohol research center at indiana
university were used throughout the study and were fed with
standard rat chow (rodent diet 8640, harlan, indianapolis,
in) ad libitum. upon arrival, all animals were housed in cages
with three animals per cage and drank only water for 1 week.
later, animals were singly caged and continued drinking
liquid ad libitum (24-h continuous availability). p rats
randomly tagged for alcohol drinking spent 4 days with only
one bottle of 10% ethanol and then they were given two bottles
according to the protocols below. rats were separated into
several groups and were subjected to one of the following
drinking protocols: groups 1 and 2: p rats offered two bottles
per cage containing only water for 2 (n = 15, group 1) or 6
(n = 8, group 2 months) months; groups 3 and 4: animals
with one bottle with water and another bottle with 10%
(vol:vol) ethanol diluted in water for 2 (n = 10, group 3) or
6 (n = 5, group 4) months of continuous access; group 5:
animals with one water bottle and a 10% ethanol bottle for
2 months that were withdrawn from ethanol (that is, they had
two bottles with water) the last 3 days before sacrifice (n = 9);
group 6: animals with one water bottle and a 10% ethanol
bottle for 6 months that were withdrawn from ethanol during
3 days at 60 and 150 days after single-caging and for 3 days
before sacrifice (n = 8); group 7: np rats, which had two
bottles, both with water, for 2 months (n = 6). two times per
week, the volume of liquid consumed from each bottle was
measured. at the end of each measuring session bottles were
refilled and their content measured again. measurements of
liquid intake were always made between 9 and 12 am and
the last measurement was made on the morning of the day
the animals were sacrificed and perfused. in those groups
with withdrawal periods, measurements of liquid intake were
always taken in the day before the start of withdrawal.
to rule out a bias towards drinking from a particular bottle
simply because of its position, the drinking spouts and the
position of the bottles were changed during the refilling
sessions. at the end of the drinking schedules rats were
perfused through the heart with 50 ml of phosphate buffered
saline solution and 250 ml of 4% paraformaldehyde. dissected
brains were postfixed overnight and submerged sequentially
into 10 and 30% sucrose. coronal sections at a thickness of

30 mm that included the rat prelimbic cortex were obtained
with a vibratome, and stored in an antifreeze solution at
–20 c. from each brain three coronal sections through the
pfc containing the prelimbic region and separated by
1 mm (approximately levels 6, 8 and 10 of the atlas of
paxinos and watson (paxinos and watson, 1998) were preincubated in a solution of 0.1 m tris–hcl buffer, ph 7.4,
containing 1% bsa, and 200 mg/ml triton x (incubation
solution, used throughout all incubations) and then stored
overnight in the same solution containing a monoclonal antibody to gfap (chemicon, temecula, ca, usa) at 1:1000
dilution. three other adjacent, equally spaced sections were
incubated overnight at 4 c with a monoclonal antibody to
gs (chemicon, temecula, ca, usa) also at 1:1000. after
incubation in the first antibody sections were washed for
30 min in tris–hcl and incubated for 90 min at room temperature with a biotinylated anti-mouse secondary antibody
(1:200, vector laboratories, burlingame, ca). after another
30-min wash in tris–hcl, sections were incubated for
60 min at room temperature with the abc complex (vector
laboratories, burlingame, ca). immunoreactivity was visualized in a solution with 0.05% 30 -30 -diaminobenzidine, 0.6%
and nickel ammonium sulphate, and 0.01% h2o2 in 0.1m
tris–hcl at ph 7.6. possible variability of immunostaining
due to varying experimental conditions between experiments
was minimized by immunostaining equal numbers of
samples from each of the four 2-month treatment groups
in every single experiment while using aliquots of the
same washing, antibody, and chromogenic reaction solutions. the sections from the animals with 6 months of treatment were also processed simultaneously although at a
different time from the 2-month survival experiments. in
the immunostained pfc sections, the prelimbic region (plc)
was delineated aided by an adjacent section stained with
cresyl violet. identification of plc was performed according to the cytoarchitectonic criteria described by uylings
et al. (van eden and uylings, 1985a, b; uylings and van
eden, 1990; uylings et al., 2003) for the rat brain. omission
of the primary antibody, the biotinylated secondary antibody
or the abc complex resulted in the absence of specific
immunoreactivity either in the neuropil, in cell bodies or in
processes.

lobe was drawn in nissl-stained coronal sections 360 mm
apart (8–10 sections per brain) from the rostral tip of the
pfc to the beginning of the corpus callosum, and the area
within each outline was measured using the area measurement
capabilities of the stereo investigator software (microbrightfield, inc.). in each brain, the sum of all areas from a brain
was multiplied by the distance in between the sections
measured (360 mm) to obtain an estimate of the volume of
the frontal lobe.
statistics differences in the packing density of immunoreactive astrocytes and in the volume of the frontal cortex
were analysed using analysis of variance (anova). if
anova showed a significant effect of the group on any
of the dependent variables the tukey–kramer test was
used for post hoc multiple comparisons. for comparisons of
alcohol intake before and after the withdrawal, the paired
student’s t-test was applied. correlation between the packing density of immunoreactive astrocytes and the ethanol
consumption in the days preceding withdrawal or sacrifice

in groups 1 and 3 were performed with pearson correlation
analysis.

results
qualitative observations
the immunostaining for both gs and gfap allowed distinguishing individual astrocytes. gfap immunostaining was
restricted to solidly immunoreactive processes and virtually
without diffuse staining in the neuropil. this immunostaining
pattern allowed identification of astrocytes by the several positive processes clearly diverging from a common centre,
although the cell bodies were not fully filled with gfap labelling. gs immunoreactivity was considerably more widespread
and was more diffusely distributed in the neuropil than gfap
immunoreactivity. in addition, the cell bodies of astrocytes
were filled with gs immunoreactivity, the initial segments

of their processes being easily identifiable (fig. 1). due to a
more conspicuous gs staining of the cell bodies of astrocytes,
more individual astrocytes were routinely identified and
counted in gs-immunostained sections than in gfapimmunostained sections.
packing density of gs and gfap-immunoreactive
astrocytes
the packing density of gs-immunoreactive astrocytes in the
prelimbic cortex was significantly different among the four
experimental groups with 2 months treatments f(3,36)
= 12.56, p < 0.0001 (fig. 2a). post hoc comparisons revealed
that packing density was significantly higher in ethanolwithdrawn p (wp) (group 5) rats than in naı̈ve (group 1)
(q = 6.11, p < 0.001) or in non-withdrawn ethanol drinking
(ep) (group 3) (q = 6.68, p < 0.001) p rats. in np rats

astrocytes in the prelimbic cortex of np rats, alcohol naı̈ve p rats, alcoholdrinking p rats, and alcohol drinking p rats with withdrawal after 2-month
(a) or 6-month treatments (b). the experiment with 6-month exposure only
included p rats. the identification of groups is as in fig. 2. whiskers represent
the standard error of the mean.

(group 7) the density of gs-ir astrocytes was not different
from that in wp rats although it was significantly higher
than in naı̈ve p rats (q = 5.34, p < 0.01) and in ep rats (q =
5.95, p < 0.001).
the density of gs-immunoreactive astrocytes was also
significantly different among the groups of animals with
6 months treatments f(2,18) = 4.51, p < 0.03 ) (fig. 2b).
again, rats with three withdrawal periods (group 6) had a
higher density of gs or gfap-immunoreactive astrocytes
than 6-month ep rats (group 4) (q = 4.05, p < 0.05). the
density in 6-month wp rats (group 6) was also higher than
in naı̈ve p rats (group 2), but the difference was not significant
(q = 2.93). the density in 6-month naı̈ve (group 2) and
6-month ep (group 4) rats appeared increased as compared
with the density in the groups of rats with 2-month treatments.
the results concerning the density of gfapimmunoreactive astrocytes were similar to those of
gs-immunoreactive astrocytes. differences between groups
at 2 and 6 months were significant [f(3,29) = 5.27,
p < 0.005, 2 months; f(2,20) = 5.74, p < 0.02, 6 months].

astrocytes was significantly higher in animals with withdrawal
periods than in naı̈ve or ep rats but was not significantly
different from np rats. at 6 months (fig. 3b), the density
of gfap-ir astrocytes was highest in the group with three
withdrawals, and in this group that density was significantly
higher than in the group with continuous access to 10%
ethanol (q = 4.781, p < 0.01).
at 2 months of survival the volume of the prefrontal cortex
comprised between the rostral most tip of the cortex and the
beginning of the corpus callosum was not different among
np rats, alcohol-naı̈ve p rats, alcohol-drinking p rats without
withdrawal, and alcohol-drinking p rats with a terminal
3-day withdrawal period.
alcohol deprivation effect on ethanol intake in rats with
three withdrawal periods
analysis of the drinking patterns immediately before and after
the two first 3-day withdrawal periods in rats exposed to alcohol drinking for 6 months revealed that, in the week after the
withdrawal, rats drink more alcohol than in the week immediately preceding the withdrawal (fig. 4), both in the first
(t = 2.562, p = 0.019) and the second withdrawal (t = 2.103,
p = 0.037). at those days corresponding to the days of
withdrawal of wp rats (group 7), ep rats (continuous
6-month ethanol drinking, group 6) did not show significant
differences in the levels of ethanol intake.

the prelimbic cortex of alcohol-withdrawn (a), and alcohol-drinking rats
without withdrawal (b).

correlation of pre-withdrawal ethanol intake and
density of immunoreactive astrocytes
in order to explore whether the levels of alcohol drinking
before withdrawal may predict the packing density of gs or
gfap-immunoreactive astrocytes measured after withdrawal,
we examined the correlation between the average ethanol consumption (expressed in daily grams of ethanol per kilogram
of body weight) in the 4 days preceding the initiation of
withdrawal and the packing density of gs-ir or gfap-ir
astrocytes after the last withdrawal (3 days duration before
sacrifice) in animals with 2-month ethanol exposure.

we found a significant positive correlation (r2 = 0.469,
p = 0.044) between the packing density of gs-ir astrocytes
and the pre-withdrawal level of alcohol consumption
(fig. 5a). however, there was no correlation between the
density of gfap-ir astrocytes and the pre-withdrawal ethanol
consumption (r2 = 0.039, p = 0.446). in animals that were not
withdrawn from ethanol there was no correlation of ethanol
consumption (in the same days as those in the
pre-withdrawal period of the withdrawn animals) with the
density of either gs-ir (r2 = 0.0068, p = 0.822) (fig. 5b)
or gfap-ir (r2 = 0.1002, p = 0.2007) cells.

the present results support a relationship between withdrawal
from free-choice ethanol intake and increases in the density
of gs- and gfap-immunoreactive astrocytes in the rat
prefrontal cortex. the present study does not distinguish
whether the increase in detectable gs-ir astrocytes is due to
alterations in the turnover of astrocytes, to an increase in the
numbers of identifiable astrocytes because of an increase in
gs synthesis, or to both phenomena simultaneously. the magnitude of the effect, however, appears to be larger for gs-ir
astrocytes than for gfap-ir astrocytes. in fact, a stronger
positive relationship between the detection of gs-ir
astrocytes and the magnitude of pre-withdrawal ethanol
consumption is underscored by the significant positive
correlation of ethanol consumption in the 4 days preceding
the withdrawal with the packing density of gs-ir (but not
gfap-ir) astrocytes measured 3 days into the final withdrawal. the regulation of gs-ir astrocytes during withdrawal
is consistent with the glutamatergic activation that has been
measured by other authors in the brain during withdrawal
(hoffman, 1995; dahchour and de witte, 1999; rossetti
et al., 1999). in addition, such regulation indicates that astrocytes, through the involvement of gs, may play an important
role in regulating the effects of putative glutamatergic activation in the prefrontal cortex of alcohol-preferring rats.
in vitro experiments have shown that alcohol inhibits the
activity of gs (davies and vernadakis, 1984) and the proliferation of cultured astrocytes (davies and vernadakis, 1984;
kane et al., 1996). a change in the population of immunoreactive astrocytes caused by alcohol drinking is not evident in
our experiments at 2 or 6 months of continuous free-choice
ethanol intake. although binge ethanol produces a reduction
in cell proliferation in the hippocampus, chronic ethanol
intake (30 days) appears to result in compensatory mechanisms that restore proliferation in the dentate gyrus to normal
levels (rice et al., 2004). if such compensatory mechanisms
occur in the plc, this may partly explain the absence of
changes in density of gs immunoreactivity in ethanoldrinking p rats. on the other hand the higher density of gsir astrocytes observed after withdrawal from free-choice
ethanol intake may be due to increased proliferation of gsimmunoreactive astrocytes caused by withdrawal itself.
recently, withdrawal from chronic binge alcohol intake has
been found associated with an increase in cell proliferation
in the hippocampus that appears to be independent of the
severity of withdrawal (nixon and crews, 2004). further
experimentation is needed to determine if the increased number of gs- and gfap-ir astrocytes in the prelimbic cortex
of the p rat is related to withdrawal-induced cell proliferation.
the present data of lower density of gs-ir (and gfap-ir)
astrocytes in the plc of alcohol-naı̈ve p rats as compared with
np rats are also in line with our previous study showing a
significantly lower number of gfap-ir astrocytes in p rats
as compared with np and wistar rats (miguel hidalgo,
2005). in addition, the withdrawal-related increase in the
packing density of gs- and gfap-immunoreactive astrocytes
appears to occur concomitantly with a significant ade
(observed in the two first periods of withdrawal in animals
with 6-month alcohol-drinking and three withdrawal periods).
this coincidence may link the ade to the increased gs

immunoreactivity. clearly, experiments with longer periods
of ethanol deprivation (at times when the alcohol deprivation
can still be detected) are needed to determine whether the
number of gs-ir astrocytes remains elevated or returns to
lower values beyond 3 days of abstinence.
the initially higher packing density of gs-ir astrocytes in
np rats than in alcohol-naı̈ve p rats would be consistent with
an influence of lower gs-ir astrocytes in the initiation of
high alcohol drinking. however, a simple correlation between
a higher density of gs-ir astrocytes and lower ingestion of
ethanol is not straightforward because, after withdrawal,
animals show both ade (increased alcohol intake) and a
higher average packing density of gs-ir astrocytes. it is
also possible that the packing density of gs-ir astrocytes is
linked to neural processes in the prelimbic cortex that influence the initial response to the ingestion of substances of
abuse, and, upon initiation of such ingestion and development
of dependence in p rats, compensatory changes due to withdrawal from free-choice ethanol drinking are more important
in driving the expression of gs in astrocytes, while the
increased ethanol drinking that defines ade might be unrelated to the withdrawal-induced increase in gs-ir astrocytes.
in summary, the present results suggest that a relatively low
(as compared with np rats) packing density of gs-ir astrocytes in p rats is increased after withdrawal from free-choice
ethanol drinking, but that the density of gs-ir astrocytes at
3 days of withdrawal is dependent on the levels of prewithdrawal alcohol drinking. further experiments are needed
to determine if changes in gs-ir astrocytes are due to
increases in the synthesis of gs, or to changes in the survival
and proliferation of astrocytes.
