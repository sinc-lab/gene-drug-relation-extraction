the chemical and enzymatic pathways of  xxxd3522xxx  , epoxide and quinone reduction have been investigated. the reduction of the epoxide by thiols is known to involve a thiol-adduct and a hydroxy vitamin
k enolate intermediate which eliminates water to yield the quinone. sodium borohydride treatment
resulted in carbonyl reduction generating relatively stable compounds that did not proceed to quinone in
the presence of base. nad(p)h: xxxg521xxx  ( xxxg1592xxx . e.c. i .6.99.2) reduction of
 xxxd3522xxx  to the hydroquinone was a significant process in intact microsomes. but 1/5th the rate of the
dithiothreitol (dtt)-dependent reduction. n o evidence was found for  xxxg1592xxx  catalyzed reduction
ofvitamin k , epoxide, nor was it capable of mediating transfer ofelectrons from nadh to the microsomal
epoxide reducing enzyme. purified  xxxg641xxx  reduced detergent- solubilized  xxxd3522xxx ,lo-’ as rapidly as
it reduced dichlorophenylindophenol(dcpip). reduction of iopm  xxxd3522xxx , by 200pm nadh was not
inhibited by iopm  xxxd1875xxx . whereas dcpip reduction was fully inhibited. in contrast to  xxxd3522xxx ,
( xxxd2563xxx ).  xxxd3522xxx  , (phylloquinone) did not stimulate microsomal nadph consumption in the
presence or absence of  xxxd1875xxx . dtt-dependent  xxxd3522xxx  epoxide reduction and  xxxd3522xxx  reduction
were shown to be mutually inhibitory reactions. suggesting that both occur at the same enzymatic site. on
this basis, a mechanism for reduction of the quinone by thiols is proposed. both the dtt-dependent
reduction of  xxxd3522xxx  , epoxide and quinone. and the reduction of dcpip by purified  xxxg1592xxx  were
inhibited by  xxxd1875xxx , warfarin. lapachol. and sulphaquinoxaline.

introduction
 xxxd3522xxx -dependent carboxylase catalyzes the post-translational formation of
gamma-carboxyglutamyl residues in the blood coagulation factors 11, vii, ix, and x,
proteins c , s, and z. and several other proteins.’ the reaction occurs in the rough
endoplasmic reticulum and requires  xxxd3522xxx  , hydroquinone (mh,), molecular
oxygen, carbon dioxide, and a peptide-bound glutamyl substrate. during the reaction, the vitamin is converted to  xxxd3522xxx  2.3-epoxide (ko). the epoxide can be
reduced by a coumarin anticoagulant sensitive microsomal  xxxd3522xxx  epoxide reductase which is assayed using dithiothreitol (dtt) as the reductant in vitro.’ recent
work has shown that thioredoxin, plus  xxxg1826xxx . can act as a reductant
for the reaction and this system may well represent the physiologically-relevant

initially inferred from the observation of anticoagulant-inhibitable (dtt
vitamink)-dependent carboxylation.' the reaction was subsequently detected by direct
hplc assay for the hydroquinone.' early work on  xxxg1592xxx  (also called
 xxxd3522xxx  reductase) while demonstrating nad(p)h oxidation in the presence of
 xxxd3522xxx , showed only a slow rate of reaction with  xxxd3522xxx  , .8.9 indirect evidence
for  xxxd3522xxx  , reduction was obtained by showing that purified  xxxg1592xxx  could

ed microsomes." indirect evidence was also obtained by observation of the coupled
reduction of fe(cn)i- entrapped in liposomes containing  xxxd3522xxx , in the membranes and  xxxg1592xxx , plus nadh on the outside." direct evidence of dtdiaphorase catalyzed  xxxd3522xxx  i hydroquinone formation was eventually obtained by
hplc analysis." the relative importance of the dtt-dependent and nadh-dependent quinone reduction pathways under various therapeutic conditions and in various
tissues are continuing subjects of debate.13-ls
recently, it has been shown that  xxxg1592xxx  can reduce benzoquinone epoxide
to 2-hydroxybenzohydroquinone and suggested that  xxxg1592xxx  also can reduce
dimethylnaphthoquinone epoxide."
in this paper, the chemically-feasible pathways of  xxxd3522xxx  epoxide reduction and
the potential for  xxxg1592xxx  to catalyze  xxxd3522xxx  epoxide and quinone reduction
are explored. the relationship and possible mechanisms of the dtt-dependent
 xxxd3522xxx  epoxide and quinone reduction reactions are examined. the mechanism of
a number of inhibitors of both  xxxg1592xxx  and  xxxd3522xxx  epoxide reductase is
discussed.

chemical pathways of  xxxd3522xxx  epo.\ide reduction

scheme 1 illustrates several potential pathways of  xxxd3522xxx  epoxide reduction. the
reaction of the epoxide (i) with thiols has previously been shown to involve a thiol
adduct intermediate (11) and a hydroxyvitamin k enol intermediate (iiia) which can
eliminate water upon treatment with base to yield the quinone (iv).’o.’’.’2the keto
tautomer of this intermediate (iiib) can be isolated as a by-product of the dttdependent reduction of the epoxide by warfarin-resistant rat liver microsomes, suggesting this is also an intermediate in the enzymatic reaction mechanism.” this same

scheme 1 potential pathways of  xxxd3522xxx  epoxide reduction. the pathway shown for  xxxg641xxx 
reduction occurs for benzoquinone epoxides, but is shown here to be negligible for  xxxd3522xxx  epoxide.

2,3-dihydro-3-hydroxy-vitamink derivative could also be obtained by direct reduction of the oxirane ring, however, a reaction following this pathway has not been
demonstrated. the quinone undergoes further reaction with thiols to generate the
hydroquinone (v) under conditions similar to those for epoxide reducti~n.~.".'~
in an attempt to synthesize standards for the expected initial products of dtdiaphorase catalyzed reduction of the epoxide, the reaction of the epoxide with
sodium borohydride was investigated. the reaction of 20mm  xxxd3522xxx  , epoxide
with 5 mm nabh, in ethanol is virtually instantaneous and complete. the product
of the reaction was stable to air reoxidation and treatment with the base triethylamine
for over 24 hours. the nmr spectrum of the product was clearly inconsistent with
the structure of the proposed 1,6-reduction product (vi), but would be consistent with
a mixture of the products of 1,2-carbonyl reduction (vii). the base stability of this
product suggests that it could not be an intermediate in the reported  xxxg1592xxx 
catalyzed reduction of epoxides. in the presence of excess nabh, rapid reduction of
the second carbonyl group occurs to yield  xxxd3522xxx  epoxide diol (viii). the
suggested, but only partially supported, structure of this previously reported material" was confirmed by 'h-nmr spectroscopy and a  xxxd2350xxx -nmr attached proton test.
this material was also found to be base stable, suggesting it cannot undergo isomerization to open the oxirane ring and eliminate water to yield the hydroquinone (v)
directly. it was, however, previously shown to be a weakly active form of the vitamin
in vivo," suggesting that some pathway for its conversion to the hydroquinone must
occur, perhaps involving its reoxidation to the epoxide.
the reported reduction of benzoquinone epoxide by  xxxg1592xxx  presumably
must involve an initial 1,6-reduction reaction to generate an intermediate similar to
vi, but lacking the fused benzenoid ring. this reaction may be more facile for
benzoquinone than for naphthoquinone epoxides since reduction of the former would
not result in loss of aromaticity. isomerization of the structure would open the

oxirane ring to form an intermediate similar to 111. formation of the reported
product, a hydroxy-substituted hydroquinone (ix), would result from enolization
driven by the aromaticity gained in the hydroquinone. for dialkyl-substituted quinone epoxides, such as  xxxd3522xxx  , epoxide. no such enolization is possible, and only
quinone product should be observed.

table 1 shows the results obtained by hplc analysis for the direct assay of dtdiaphorase catalyzed  xxxd3522xxx  reduction in comparison with the rate for spectrophotometric assay of dcpip reduction. conditions known to stimulate the dtdiaphorase reduction of other quinones were tested in an attempt to optimize the rate
of reaction. whereas bsa and tween-20 are well known stimulators of dcpip and
 xxxd3522xxx , ( xxxd2563xxx ) reduction.' they had a minimal effect or actually inhibited
 xxxd3522xxx  , (phylloquinone) reduction.  xxxd3522xxx  , reduction was five orders of
magnitude slower than dcpip reduction under the conditions tested. n o  xxxd3522xxx  ,
epoxide reduction was detected under any of the conditions tested and using two
different hplc analysis methods.
 xxxd1875xxx  is the classic inhibitor of dt-diaphorasexand is significantly more
potent than the related 4-hydroxycoumarin, warfarin. surprisingly, although these
compounds inhibited  xxxg1592xxx  reduction of dcpip, they had no effect on
reduction of  xxxd3522xxx  , . this may be reasonable in view of the action of these
compounds as competitive inhibitors versus nadh binding to the oxidized form of
the enzyme.24the low activity of  xxxd3522xxx  , may result in very low levels of the
oxidized enzyme being present in the steady state.

capable of reducing the epoxide nor of providing reducing equivalents to the membrane bound dtt-dependent epoxide reductase. cytosolic  xxxg1592xxx , as opposed to membrane associated enzyme. may not normally contribute significantly to
 xxxd3522xxx  , reduction in vivo since addition of a very large excess of purified enzyme
stimulated reduction only minimally. the dtt-dependent reduction of  xxxd3522xxx  , is
significantly greater than the nadh-dependent reaction and the thiol-dependent

workers.i3.l 4
 xxxd3522xxx , ( xxxd2563xxx ) is known to stimulate microsomal oxidation of nadph
via both 2-electron reduction and 1 -electron reduction/semiquinone reoxidation pathways. the latter pathway is stimulated upon  xxxd1875xxx  inhibition of the dtdiaphorase catalyzed 2-electron reduction.'5 addition of 10pm  xxxd3522xxx , to microsomes equivalent to 5 mg-liver/ml and 200 pm nadph in 0.25 m sucrose,
0.025m tris-hc1, 0.1% triton x-100 buffer, ph 7.4, containing 10pm  xxxd1875xxx , resulted in a greater than stoichiometric decrease in nadph absorbance at
340 nm with an initial rate of 0.025 au/min. no detectable decrease in absorbance
( < 0.002 au/min) occurred for addition of 10pm  xxxd3522xxx  , in the presence or
absence of  xxxd1875xxx . these results suggest that  xxxd3522xxx  , is a poor substrate for
redox cycling via nadph:cytochrome p450 reductase, as well as a poor substrate for
microsomal  xxxg1592xxx , in comparison with  xxxd3522xxx  , .

concentration of microsomes in the presence of dtt.  xxxd3522xxx  formation reaches
a steady state after several minutes whereas  xxxd3522xxx  hydroquinone formation only
becomes significant after accumulation of the quinone. in contrast, the formation of
 xxxd3522xxx  hydroquinone from exogenously added quinone is linear over the same
time interval (data not shown). these results are consistent with a sequential two step
reduction pathway in which the quinone is an intermediate in hydroquinone formation from the epoxide. the total extent of epoxide reduction is given by the sum of
the quinone plus hydroquinone concentrations and the total amount of reductive
activity by the quinone plus twice the hydroquinone concentration.

the extent of hydroquinone formation from exogenously added quinone with that for
quinone generated in situ from the epoxide. for this plot, the quinone concentration
present at the end of the incubation was used. at low epoxide concentrations, the
quinone generated in situ is a more effective substrate than exogenously added
quinone. this phenomenon most likely reflects diffusion limited channeling of the
intermediate. at high epoxide concentration, a decrease in the extent of hydroquinone
formation is observed, despite the continuing increase in the steady state concentration of quinone substrate. this result suggests possible inhibition of quinone reduction by the epoxide.
at shorter incubation times, secondary reduction of the quinone formed from the
epoxide may be neglected and valid initial velocity data for epoxide reduction can be
obtained in the absence of the competing reaction. under these conditions, the
epoxide and the quinone are fairly comparable substrates for microsomal reduction
(k,m= 14pm k,o, vma, = 1.2nmol/min/g-liver; k , = 8 p m k , , vma, =
0.5 nmol/min/g-liver).
several lines of evidence suggest that both the epoxide reduction and the quinone
reduction occur at the same enzymatic site.’h we have previously reported the use of
menaquinone-4 epoxide and quinone (geranylgeranyl-side chains) as competing substrates versus  xxxd3522xxx  , epoxide (phytyl-side chain) to demonstrate quinone inhibition of epoxide reduction.” in the following experiments, both the quinone and

figure 4 inhibition of iopm  xxxd3522xxx  , epoxide reduction by menaquinone-4

these results, together with the demonstration of epoxide inhibition of quinone
reduction, are consistent with reduction of both the epoxide and the quinone by a
single enzyme via a ping-pong mechanism involving oxidized and reduced forms of
an active site disulphide. release of the quinone in this model is irreversible, assuring
that the overall two step reduction sequence can occur. scheme 2 shows a proposed
model for  xxxd3522xxx  epoxide reduction by  xxxd3522xxx  epoxide reductase based on the
chemical model studies and observation of hydroxy  xxxd3522xxx  formation by the
warfarin-resistant rat strain enzyme. scheme 3 shows a potential model for vitamin
k reduction at the same active site utilizing the same catalytic groups.

inhibitors of  xxxd3522xxx  epoxide reductase and  xxxg1592xxx 
table 4 compares the sensitivity of  xxxd3522xxx  epoxide reductase and  xxxg1592xxx 
to a number of inhibitors. in warfarin-resistant-strain
rats, the
epoxide reductase is decreased, but that of the  xxxg641xxx  is not, distinguishing the
epoxide reductase as the pharmacologically important site of coumarin anticoagulant
action.” the  xxxg641xxx  is uniquely sensitive to  xxxd1875xxx , whereas the sensitivity
of the epoxide reductase is similar for various derivatives having large hydrophobic
side chains (data not shown). inhibition of  xxxg1592xxx  by  xxxd1875xxx  and warfarin is known to be competitive versus nadh, k, = 10nm  xxxd1875xxx ,
k, = 23pm warfarin in the presence of tween-20.24
it has been difficult to demonstrate reversibility of coumarin anticoagulant inhibition of the epoxide reductase, and until recently kinetic studies of the inhibition did

not seem appropriate. using a solubilized enzyme preparation,” it has been possible
to show that inhibition by 3-ethyl-4-hydroxycoumarin can be reversed by sephadex
g-25 chromatography. warfarin inhibition was only partially reversible, in the
absence of dtt, but almost fully reversible by addition of dtt prior to chromatography (data not shown). the kinetics of 3-ethyl-4-hydroxycoumarin inhibition were
found to be approximately competitive versus dtt (kj = 5.7pm) and uncompetitive versus the epoxide (data not shown). these results are consistent with binding of
4-hydroxycoumarins to the oxidized form of the enzyme as has previously been
suggested.33similar trends were found for warfarin inhibition of the epoxide reductase, but simple linear inhibitions were not observed. inhibition of the warfarin-resistant enzyme by high concentrations of warfarin was freely reversible and remained
approximately competitive versus dtt, but with a much higher ki. lapachol

reductase are similar in their behavior to 4-hydroxycoumarin anticoagulant inhibition.
we have previously suggested that these compounds act as analogues of the
proposed hydroxy  xxxd3522xxx  enolate intermediate (111) bound to the oxidized form
of the enzyme shown in scheme 2.2'.'4a lower affinity for the enolate, as well as for
these inhibitors, would account for the formation of hydroxy  xxxd3522xxx  (scheme i ,
iiib) by the warfarin-resistant rat enzyme.
that these compounds can assume similar electronic and steric structures is emphasized by the observation that they are all also inhibitors of  xxxg1592xxx . lapachol
was previously shown to be competitive versus nadh, k , = 0. i5 pm.i5 this observation is of particular note given the recent report that  xxxg1592xxx  can reduce
quinone epoxides to hydroxy-substituted hydroquinones.'6 we have subsequently
shown that sulphaquinoxaline is also an inhibitor of  xxxg1592xxx , competitive versus
nadh, k, = 6 pm (submitted). whether all three classes of compound bind to the
same site on the oxidized form of  xxxg1592xxx  in the same relative orientations as
suggested for inhibition of the epoxide reductase remains to be determined.
ticrynafen is unique in that it inhibits  xxxg1592xxx , but not  xxxd3522xxx  epoxide
reductase. inhibition of the  xxxg641xxx  is competitive versus nadh, k , = 1.3 pm,
and mutually exclusive with warfarin." the orientation and structural similarity of
this compound to the other inhibitors is not clear, and its local interaction with the
enzyme may be different. this inhibitor has been used to demonstrate that dtdiaphorase has no role in microsomal  xxxd3522xxx  epoxide reduction using cytosol as
the reductant." thus far no specific inhibitors are known which inhibit  xxxd3522xxx 
epoxide reductase, but not  xxxg1592xxx .
clearly the inhibitor binding sites of  xxxd3522xxx  epoxide reductase and dtdiaphorase share some common features and it is likely that additional mutual
inhibitors will be identified.
