abstract
antinociceptive effects of various neuroleptics in animal acute pain-models have been described, mediated trough different pathways
including the opioid system. in this study, we assessed the antinociceptive effects of the atypical neuroleptic drug  xxxd155xxx , which acts as a
selective blocker of dopamine d2 and d3 receptors. furthermore, at low doses  xxxd155xxx  has a selective preference for presynaptic
dopamine autoreceptors, while at high doses it manifests a preferential action at post-synaptic dopamine receptors. we found  xxxd155xxx  to
be a potent antinociceptor agent in the mouse tail-flick assay, with an ed50 of 36.6 mg/kg. this effect was antagonized by naloxone
( p < 0.05), indicating an involvement of opioid mechanisms as mediators of the antinociceptive effect of  xxxd155xxx . h-funaltrexamine (a1and a2-opioid receptor antagonist), naloxonazine (selective a1-opioid receptor antagonist), naltrindole (selective y-opioid receptor
antagonist), nor-binaltorphamine (n1-opioid receptor antagonist) reversed  xxxd155xxx  antinociception at the same dose that they antagonized
morphine’s antinociceptive effect (all p < 0.005). we found that the sensitivity of  xxxd155xxx -induced antinociception is mediated through
selective involvement of all three opioid receptor subtypes. based on previous studies with risperidone, clozapine and olanzapine we tend to
attribute this global interaction with the opioid system to  xxxd155xxx ’s action at the dopamine  xxxg656xxx  sites.

1. introduction
although antinociceptive effects of various neuroleptics
in animal pain-models have been described and assessed,
neuroleptics as a group do not have a well-established place
in the management of pain. the clinical use of the traditional neuroleptics for pain management was controversial
at best and limited, due to the frequent complications of
parkinsonian and other side effects (fields, 1989). these
side effects are inevitable when treating psychosis, but
outweigh benefit when treating pain, where other effective
classes of drugs exist. nevertheless, the clinical use of
traditional neuroleptics, especially in combination with
opiates or tricyclic antidepressants, is not uncommon (dundee et al., 1963; fields, 1989; mersky and hester, 1972;
taub, 1973; zitman et al., 1991). since the introduction of
the newer generations of neuroleptics (both novel and

atypical) with a reduced profile of side effects, the possible
use of this class of medications in the management of pain is
an issue to be addressed. in previous studies, we found that
some new-generation antipsychotic agents augment differently opioid-induced antinociception, as in the case of the
novel antipsychotic drug risperidone (schreiber et al., 1997)
and the atypical neuroleptic drugs clozapine and olanzapine
(schreiber et al., 1999).
 xxxd155xxx  is another new atypical antipsychotic agent,
which chemically is part of a class of substituted benzamides. it acts as a selective blocker of dopamine d2 and d3
receptors, and has little affinity for other dopamine receptor
subtypes (d1, d4 or d5) or other neurotransmitter receptors
(serotonin, histamine, muscarinic, adrenergic) (schoemaker
et al., 1997). its atypical profile depends on blockade of the
mesolimbic dopaminergic tracts rather than nigrostriatal
dopaminergic transmission and on a preferential blockade
of dopamine d3 receptors in the limbic system (castelli et
al., 2001). at low doses it has a selective preference for
presynaptic dopamine autoreceptors, thereby increasing dopaminergic transmission. this can explain its advantage in

treating negative symptoms in schizophrenic patients
(lecrubier, 2002; muller et al., 2002). however, at higher
doses it blocks post-synaptic dopamine receptors, thus
controlling the psychotic symptoms (coulouvrat and dondey-nouvel, 1999; perrault et al., 1997; castelli et al., 2001;
leucht et al., 2002).
in a study evaluating the interaction of the dopamine
 xxxg657xxx  agonist ( f ) -7-hydroxy-dipropylaminotetralin
(7-oh-dpat) with the opioid system, cook et al. (1999)
found it to induce a dose-dependent attenuation of the
antinociceptive effects of morphine and  xxxd1864xxx . this
finding suggests a possible modulation of antinociception
of morphine mediated through the  xxxg657xxx .
since  xxxd155xxx  involves  xxxg657xxx  blockade, we hypothesized that it would exert an antinociceptive effect. furthermore, since we found in our previous
studies that different dopamine receptor subtypes mediate
antinociception by different interactions with the opioid
system (schreiber et al., 1997, 1999), we assumed that
assessing the antinociceptive properties of a drug that
interacts both with dopamine d2 and d3 receptors
( xxxd155xxx ) may shed some light on the different effects
of dopamine d2 and  xxxg657xxx  subtypes on opioid
regulation.
the aim of this present study was to evaluate whether
 xxxd155xxx  has an antinociceptive effect, and if so, is this
effect mediated through opioid mechanisms.

2. materials and methods
2.1. subjects and surgery
male icr mice (age 5 – 6 weeks), from tel-aviv university colony (tel-aviv, israel), weight 25 –35 g were used.
the mice were maintained on a 12-h light/12-h dark cycles
with purina rodent chow and water available ad libitum.
animals were housed five per cage in a room maintained at
22 + 0.5 jc until testing. mice were used only once.
intrathecal (i.t.) injections were introduced by lumbar puncture (hylden and wilcox, 1980) all other injections were
made subcutaneously.
2.2. agents
several agents were generously donated as follows:
 xxxd155xxx  by synthelabo groupe (sylachim, mourenx,
france), morphine by teva (jerusalem, israel), naloxonazine by dr. g.w. pasternak from memorial sloankettering cancer center, new york, usa, u50,488-h
{trans-3,4-dchloro-n-methyl-n-[2-(1-pyrrolindinyl)-cyclohexyl]-benzeneacetamide} by upjohn pharmaceutics
(west sussex, england), [ d-pen 2,d -pen 5] enkephalin
(dpdpe), h-funaltrexamine, naltrindole hcl, nalorphine
hcl,  xxxd2694xxx  and nor-binaltorphamine were
obtained from the research technology branch of nida.

 xxxd155xxx  was dissolved in ethanol 70% and saline in
30:70 ratios. all other drugs were dissolved in saline.
2.3. antinociception assessment
mice were tested using the tail-flick apparatus (ugo
basile). the latencies of tail withdraw from a focused light
stimulus were measured electronically, using a photocell.
baseline latencies (1.0 – 3.5 s) were determined before
experimental treatment for each mouse as the mean of two
trials. post-treatment latencies were determined after 30 min
for each experiment and a maximal latency of 10 s was used
to minimize tissue damage. antinociception was defined
quantitatively as doubling or more of baseline values for
each mouse. for each dose at least 20 mice were checked
and their scores were summarized, showing the percentage
of animals, which became analgesic. post-treatment latencies for all s.c. administrations were determined after 30 min
and 15 min for the i.t. injected group.
2.4. procedure
the study was conducted in three experiments.
2.4.1. experiment 1
groups of mice (n = 20) were injected subcutaneously
with increasing doses of  xxxd155xxx  (from 1 mg/kg to 100
mg/kg) to determine the effect of the drug in eliciting
antinociception. normal motor behavior was observed following  xxxd155xxx  injection.
2.4.2. experiment 2
the sensitivity of  xxxd155xxx  to specific opioid receptor antagonists was examined. first we determined the
effect of two doses of the non-selective opioid antagonist
naloxone (1 and 10 mg/kg, s.c.) on high dose of  xxxd155xxx  (75 mg/kg, s.c.). both low and high doses of naloxone
inhibited  xxxd155xxx  antinociceptive effects, so we continued examining the effect of the specific opioid antagonists on  xxxd155xxx . mice (at least 20 in each group)
administrated with  xxxd155xxx  were treated with one of
the following drugs: h-funaltrexamine (a1- and a2-opioid
receptor antagonist; 40 mg/kg, s.c.) or naloxonazine (a1opioid receptor antagonist; 35 mg/kg, s.c.), 24 h before
 xxxd155xxx  challenge. naltrindole (y-opioid receptor antagonist) 20 mg/kg, s.c., nor-binaltorphamine (n-opioid
receptor antagonist) 10 mg/kg, s.c. or with saline were
injected at the same time with  xxxd155xxx . for comparison, each antagonist was tested against all the agonists in
separate groups of mice. as expected, h-funaltrexamine
and naloxonazine blocked only morphine’s antinociception, nor-binaltorphamine blocked u50, 488h antinociception and naltrindole blocked [d-pen2,d-pen5] enkephalin
antinociception (data not shown). all the drugs and doses
used in the present work were chosen in according to our
pervious works.

2.4.3. experiment 3
the sensitivity of  xxxd155xxx  to specific opioid receptor
agonists was examined. the action of  xxxd155xxx  on
selective opioid receptor subtype agonists was tested as
follows: groups of mice (n = 20) were given increasing
doses of morphine (a a-opioid receptor agonist), or with
u50,488h (a n1-opioid receptor agonist), or with [d-pen2,dpen5] enkephalin (a y-opioid receptor agonist), or with
nalorphine (a n3-opioid receptor agonist) with an inactive
dose of  xxxd155xxx  (1.0 mg/kg).
2.5. statistic analysis
dose – response curves were analyzed, using an spss
computer program. this program maximizes the log-likelihood function to fit a parallel set of gaussian normal
sigmoid curves to the dose – response data. single dose
antagonist studies were analyzed using the fisher exact test.

3. results
3.1.  xxxd155xxx  antinociception
 xxxd155xxx  induced a dose-dependent antinociceptive
effect following s.c. administration. the ed50 for mice in
the tail-flick assay for  xxxd155xxx  was 36.6 mg/kg (27.7;
47.8; 95% cl; fig. 1).
3.2. sensitivity of  xxxd155xxx  antinociceptive effect to
selective antagonists
high doses of  xxxd155xxx  (75 mg/kg, which produced
90% antinociception) were used with low and with high

doses of the non-specific opioid antagonist naloxone (1
mg/kg and 10 mg/kg). the antinociceptive effect of
 xxxd155xxx  was antagonized with both doses of naloxone
to 30% ( p < 0.05; fig. 2). these findings imply an opioid
mechanism of action involved in  xxxd155xxx -induced
antinociception.
the possible involvement of a-, y-, and n1-opioid receptor subtypes in  xxxd155xxx  antinociceptive effect was studied, using selective opioid antagonists (fig. 2). we found
that h-funaltrexamine (40 mg/kg; selective a1- and a2opioid receptor antagonist) and naloxonazine (35 mg/kg;
selective a1-opioid receptor antagonist), reversed  xxxd155xxx  antinociception at the same dose that they antagonized
morphine’s antinociceptive effect ( p < 0.005). naltrindole
(10 mg/kg; selective y-opioid receptor antagonist) reversed
 xxxd155xxx  induced antinociceptive effect at the same dose
it antagonized y-opioid receptor antinociception mediated
by [d-pen2,d-pen5] enkephalin ( p < 0.005). nor-binaltorphamine (10 mg/kg; selective k1-opioid receptor antagonist)
reversed  xxxd155xxx  induced antinociceptive effect at the
same dose that it antagonized n1-opioid receptor antinociception, mediated by u50,488h ( p < 0.005). the activity of
each of the opioid receptor antagonists was confirmed with
its prototypic agonists (data not shown). none of the opioid
receptor antagonists mediated antinociception by themselves, nor did they change the baseline latencies of the
pretreated animals. the described sensitivity of  xxxd155xxx

onists implies the selective involvement of all three opioid
receptor subtypes, thus a global opioid mechanism.
3.3. sensitivity of  xxxd155xxx  antinociceptive effect to
selective agonists
we injected the selective agonists of the opioid receptor
subtypes with or without an inactive dose of  xxxd155xxx  (1
mg/kg, s.c., table 1). we found no significant shift in the
dose – response curves, which indicate that there is no
significant augmentation of the antinociceptive effects of
opioid receptor agonists by  xxxd155xxx  (table 1).

4. discussion
in previous studies, we have found the novel antipsychotic
drug risperidone (a potent dopamine d2/ xxxg1113xxx 
antagonist) to interact with opioid receptors (mainly a1-,
a2- and n1-opioid receptor subtypes), while the two atypical
dibezo-benzodiazepines clozapine and olanzapine (both potent dopamine d3/d4/5-ht2/a2-adrenoreceptor and only
weak dopamine d2-receptor antagonists) differed regarding
their antinociceptive mechanisms. clozapine induced antinociception mediated through opioid (a1-, a2-, n1-opioid
receptor subtypes) and a2-adrenoreceptors, while olanzapine
induced nociception mediated through a2-adrenoreceptors,
with only a weak involvement of the opioid system. since
 xxxd155xxx  blocks both dopamine d2/ xxxg657xxx  subtypes,
we thought it would be interesting to assess the direct
influence of  xxxg657xxx  subtype in antinociception and analgesia, and compare it to our previous findings
with risperidone, clozapine and olanzapine. and indeed, in
the present study we have found that  xxxd155xxx  manifests
an antinociceptive effect in a dose-dependent manner, mediated through global opioid mechanisms. however, the present results show that this antinociceptive effect is blocked by
naloxone and by various selective opioid receptor subtype
antagonists with no specific augmentation of any opioid
receptor subtype agonist when given with sub-threshold
doses of  xxxd155xxx . these results may support a global
involvement of the opioid system in the antinociceptive effect
of  xxxd155xxx . contemplating these findings together with
those of our previous ones, we stipulate that the opioid
properties of  xxxd155xxx  are mediated by its dopamine d2

receptor subtype properties (and not its  xxxg657xxx 
subtype involvement).
the interactions of the dopaminergic system with the
opioid system in modulation of pain is not so simple,
although it is clear that both systems interact with each
other in more than one way. activation of dopamine that
lowered opioid analgesia and enhanced analgesia with
dopamine receptor antagonists was found in several studies
(tulunay et al., 1975; rodgers, 1977). recent studies also
show involvement of the dopaminergic system in mechanisms of antinociception. in some studies, dopamine receptors agonists facilitated analgesic response (michael-titus et
al., 1990; morgan and franklin, 1991). carta et al. (1999)
found that the dopamine  xxxg656xxx  antagonist sulpiride
suppresses the antinociceptive effects of d9-tetrahydrocannabinol using hot plate and tail-flick tests in rats. in contrast,
the antinociceptive effect of morphine in diabetic mice (but
not that in non-diabetic mice) was significantly enhanced
following pretreatment with sulpiride (kamei and saitoh,
1996). moreover, sulpiride has been also found to antagonize the dopamine-induced antinociceptive effect in rats
treated with dopamine injection to the lumbar subarachnoid
space (liu et al., 1992). king et al. (2001) supported the
traditional studies that suggested anti opioid activity of the
dopamine  xxxg656xxx  subtype by using dopamine d2
receptor subtype knock-out mice.
other studies show similar findings about the relation
between antinociception and dopamine (altier and stewart,
1998). in effort to specify which dopamine receptor subtype
is involved in analgesia and antinociception, many researchers used dopamine d1- and d2-receptor subtype agonists or
antagonists. the  xxxg655xxx  subtype in knockout mice was found not to be involved in antinociceptive
effect of n-opioid receptors in preweanling mice using the
tail-flick assay (karper et al., 2000). pretreatment with
either the selective  xxxg655xxx  antagonist sch
23390 or the dopamine  xxxg656xxx  antagonist ( )-sulpiride converted the hyperalgesia produced by the dopamine
 xxxg655xxx  agonist into an antinociceptive response, whereas the effect of the dopamine  xxxg656xxx  agonist was
significantly antagonized. sulpiride also increased antinociception induced by the n-opioid receptor agonist u50,488h
(rooney and sewell, 1989). these findings support the
relation between dopamine  xxxg656xxx  antagonists and
antinociception effect.
clozapine, a potent  xxxg658xxx  antagonist
comparing to its weak dopamine  xxxg656xxx  blockade (as
well as serotonergic, muscarinic, histaminergic and alpha
adrenergic involvements) has been found to exert an opioidmediated antinociceptive effect (schreiber et al., 1999). the
information about newer atypical neuroleptics does not
address the possible pain regulation. in a study that compare
the efficacy of serotonin selective reuptake inhibitors and
 xxxd155xxx  in burning mouth syndrome, the data suggest
that both  xxxd155xxx  and serotonin selective reuptake
inhibitors may be effective treatments (maina et al.,

t. weizman et al. / european journal of pharmacology 478 (2003) 155–159

2002). further studies are needed in order to assess the
relations of new atypical neuroleptics via their possible
opioid involvement to antinociception and analgesia, and
the possible use of this class of drugs in the pain clinic.
