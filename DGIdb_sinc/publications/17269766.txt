abstract: by solving high-resolution crystal structures of a large number (14 in this case) of adducts of
matrix metalloproteinase 12 ( xxxg1421xxx ) with strong, nanomolar, inhibitors all derived from a single ligand
scaffold, it is shown that the energetics of the ligand-protein interactions can be accounted for directly
from the structures to a level of detail that allows us to rationalize for the differential binding affinity between
pairs of closely related ligands. in each case, variations in binding affinities can be traced back to slight
improvements or worsening of specific interactions with the protein of one or more ligand atoms. isothermal
calorimetry measurements show that the binding of this class of mmp inhibitors is largely enthalpy driven,
but a favorable entropic contribution is always present. the binding enthalpy of  xxxd66xxx  (aha),
the prototype zinc-binding group in mmp drug discovery, has been also accurately measured. in principle,
this research permits the planning of either improved inhibitors, or inhibitors with improved selectivity for
one or another mmp. the present analysis is applicable to any drug target for which structural information
on adducts with a series of homologous ligands can be obtained, while structural information obtained
from in silico docking is probably not accurate enough for this type of study.

introduction

drug discovery projects aim at finding small molecules that
bind a selected protein target with high binding affinity. high
selectivity is also a desirable property especially when the
selected target belongs to a protein family. in the case of matrix
metalloproteinases (mmp), a family of closely related zinccontaining extracellular proteases, numerous high affinity inhibitors are available.1 well-known examples are  xxxd287xxx  and
marimastat belonging to the class of succinate peptidomimetic
inhibitors,2,3 the class of succinate macrocyclic inhibitors,4 the
class of sulfone hydroxamate inhibitors,5 the class of the reverse
hydroxamic acid inhibitors,6 and the class of sulfonamidic

inhibitors such as  xxxd1109xxx .7 their dissociation constants are in
the low nanomolar range. however, the selectivity versus one
or another mmp is often modest, and this is at the origin of
several side-effects discovered during the clinical trials.8 several
approaches have been proposed in order to design selective
ligands for protein targets.9-12 three-dimensional structures of
enzyme-inhibitor adducts for several ligands, belonging to the
various classes, with several different mmps are available.3,5,13-22

given the active site topology of mmps, most inhibitors share
similar features, i.e., the ability to bind to the metal ion, to the
hydrophobic pocket termed s1′, and to the substrate binding
groove (figure 1a). in such a situation, to attempt planning
ligands with increased selectivity requires an understanding of
the energetics of the inhibitor interactions with each of these
active site regions to an unprecedented level of detail. the
existing structural data for various mmp-inhibitor adducts are
many but scattered, and structure-affinity relationships at the
level of a meaningful dissection of the various contributions
can be hardly attempted.23 furthermore, the catalytic domains
of mmps undergo non-negligible conformational equilibria in
solution,17,24,25 which also involve the active site pocket. a
flexible active site is a serious drawback for the use of in silico
docking programs to design inhibitors,26 and even more to refine
them to increase selectivity.27
with this in mind, we felt it would be important to ascertain
whether, in case a large number of structures of mmp adducts
with a homologous series of ligands were available, structureaffinity relationships can be established, and, if so, whether these
relationships are accurate enough to enable meaningful proteinspecific ligand-refinement strategies. thus, we collected structural data for a large number of adducts of a homologous series
of ligands with one particular mmp. we selected  xxxg1421xxx , a
validated target for emphysema28 and multiple sclerosis,29
because a crystalline form of its catalytic domain is available17
that allows easy soaking of inhibitors. high-resolution crystal
structures of as many as 16 different adducts of the protein with
structurally related inhibitors were obtained. in parallel, the free

energies of binding (∆g°) through enzyme activity inhibition
experiments were measured for the same ligands. it is shown
that, indeed, a careful analysis of the structural data, performed
with the aid of structure-based computed interatomic interaction
energies, can provide a detailed description of how different
substituents on the same scaffold can interplay to improve or
worsen affinity and selectivity. it is proposed that this strategy
is of general validity for any drug target, provided structural
information on a number of homologous ligand-protein adducts
can be obtained. in particular, other therapeutically relevant
metalloproteinases9,30 may benefit from this approach.

expression and purification of human  xxxg1421xxx  and  xxxg1422xxx 
catalytic domain. cloning, expression, and purification of  xxxg1421xxx 
catalytic domain have been previously described.17 the cdna of
prommp13 (leu20-pro268) was cloned into the pet21 vector (novagen)
using nde i and xho i as restriction enzymes. one additional methionine
at position 19 was present in the final expression product. the e. coli
strain bl21 codon plus cells, transformed with the above plasmid,
were grown in lb medium at 310 k. the protein expression was
induced during the exponential growth phase with 0.5 mm of iptg.
the cells were harvested 3 h after induction. after lysis of the cells,
the inclusion bodies, containing the prommp13, were solubilized in 6
m urea and 20 mm tris (ph 8.0). the protein was purified on the
hitrap q column (pharmacia) with a buffer containing 6 m urea and
20 mm tris (ph 8.0). the elution was performed using a linear gradient
of nacl up to 0.6 m. the purified protein was then refolded using
multistep dialysis against solutions containing 50 mm tris (ph 7.2),
10 mm cacl2, 0.1 mm  xxxd3556xxx , and 0.3 m nacl and decreasing
concentration of urea. the refolded protein was exchanged, by dialysis,
against a buffer with 50 mm tris (ph 7.2), 5 mm cacl2, 0.1 mm
 xxxd3556xxx , and 0.3 m nacl. the protein was concentrated at roomtemperature using an amicon up to a concentration of about 30 µm.
the active protein is left overnight in these conditions to allow the
autoproteolysis of the prodomain. after addition of acetohydroxamic
acid (aha) to a final concentration of 0.5 m, the catalytic domain of
 xxxg1422xxx  (tyr104-pro268) was purified using size-exclusion chromatography with the buffer containing 50 mm tris (ph 7.2), 5 mm cacl2,
0.1 mm  xxxd3556xxx , 0.3 m nacl, and 0.2 m aha and then concentrated
using a centriprep concentrator at 277 k to a final concentration of
0.3 mm.

fluorimetric assays. the inhibition constants for the compounds
here investigated were determined, evaluating their ability to prevent
the hydrolysis of the fluorescent-quenched peptide substrate mca-proleu-gly-leu-dpa-ala-arg-nh2 (biomol inc.). all measurements were
performed in 50 mm hepes buffer, with 10 mm cacl2, 0.05% brij35, and 0.1 mm  xxxd3556xxx  (ph 7.0), using 1 nm enzyme and 1 µm peptide
at 298 k.
crystallization, data collection, and resolution of the crystal
structures. crystals of human  xxxg1421xxx , already containing aha from
the refolding process, grew at 293 k from a 0.1 m tris-hcl/30% peg
8000/200 mm aha/1.0 m licl2 solution at ph 8.0 using the vapor
diffusion technique. the final protein concentration was about 10 mg/
ml.
the complexes were obtained through soaking  xxxg1421xxx -aha
crystals with a solution containing the inhibitor itself in the presence
of licl2. crystals of  xxxg1421xxx -aha were obtained in the presence of
licl2 as well.17
the data were measured in-house, using a px-ultra copper sealed
tube source (oxford diffraction), for 3, 6, 7, 9, 13, and 14, at id29
esrf (grenoble, france) for 4 and 8, at bw7a desy (hamburg,
germany) for 1, 2, 5, 10, and 11 complexes, and at xrd-1 elettra
(trieste, italy) for 12. all the datasets were collected at 100 k, and
the crystals used for data collection were cryocooled without any
cryoprotectant treatment. the crystals of all complexes had a mosaicity
ranging from 0.3° to 0.8° and diffracted to a maximum resolution of
1.1 å.
all the soaked adducts crystallize in the c2 space group with one
molecule in the asymmetric unit while cocrystallized complex of 12
crystallizes in p21212 space group with one molecule in the asymmetric
unit.
the data were processed in all cases using the program mosflm31
and scaled using the program scala32 with the tails and secondary corrections on (the latter restrained with a tie surface
command) to achieve an empirical absorption correction. table 1s (in
supporting information) shows the data collection and processing
statistics for all datasets.
the structure of the adduct with 12 was previously solved17 using
the molecular replacement technique; the model used was that of a
molecule of human  xxxg1421xxx  (1os9) while the structure of all other
adducts were solved using the  xxxg1421xxx -aha adduct (1y93) as the
model from where the inhibitor, all the water molecules, and ions were
omitted. the correct orientation and translation of the molecule within
the crystallographic unit cell was determined with standard patterson
search techniques33,34 as implemented in the program molrep.35,36
the refinement was carried out using refmac5,37 and for the atomic
resolution datasets anisotropic b-factors were also refined. in between
the refinement cycles the models were subjected to manual rebuilding
by using xtalview.38 the same program has been used to model all
inhibitors. water molecules have been added by using the standard
procedures within the arp/warp suite,39 and for the atomic resolution
datasets, hydrogens were added at the riding positions and refined.
the stereochemical quality of the refined models was assessed using
the program procheck.40 the ramachandran plot for all structures is
of very good quality.

the coordinates for all adducts are under deposition at the proteindatabank.
energy calculation. autodock 3.05 was used to calculate the protein
ligand binding energy.41 the calculation was performed starting from
the x-ray crystal structure using reliable zn(ii) parameters.42 a box of
70 × 70 × 70 points with grid spacing of 0.375 å was created on the
protein side and centered near the catalytic zn(ii) ion. the ligands were
extracted from the x-ray structure, and hydrogen atoms were added
considering the hydroxamic group deprotonated; gaister-marsili partial
atomic charges were calculated using babel.43 the ligands were
modeled based on the x-ray structures which were already minimized
against the experimental diffraction data. energy contributions for
individual atoms were extracted from the autodock energy output.
calorimetry. isothermal titration microcalorimetry experiments
were performed at 298 k with a vp-itc microcalorimeter (microcal,
inc., northampton, ma). after an initial injection of 1 µl, aliquots of
9 µl of 200 µm inhibitor were stepwise injected into the sample cell
containing a solution 20 µm of  xxxg1421xxx  catalytic domain until complete
saturation. all experiments were performed in 20 mm tris (ph 7.2),
5 mm cacl2, 0.1 mm  xxxd3556xxx , 0.3 m nacl, and 4 mm aha with 0.1%
(v/v) dmso. heats of dilution were measured by injecting the ligand
into buffer and then subtracted from the binding heats. the thermodynamic parameters and ka values were calculated fitting data to a
single binding site model with origin 7.0 sofware (microcal, inc.).44

results and discussion

crystal structures and dissociation constants of ligandmmp12 adducts. the crystal structures of the complexes of
the catalytic domain of  xxxg1421xxx  with 14 closely related
inhibitors have been solved. figure 1b shows the scaffold
common to all these inhibitors, and the three positions on which
different functionalizations have been tested. the general
formula contains a hydroxamic group targeted to bind the
catalytic zinc ion, and an aromatic moiety bearing the r1
substituent targeted to the hydrophobic s1′ pocket. the two
groups are tethered by a sulfonamide moiety interacting with
the substrate binding groove and containing substituents r2 and
r3, potentially able to give rise to further interactions. r1 ranges
from h to f to och3 to c6h5. these variations were planned
to monitor their relative effects on the strength of the interaction
with s1′. r2 and r3 are either h or aliphatic groups with various
degrees of hydrophobicity/hydrophilicity.
a close up of the arrangement of the various ligands in the
active site of  xxxg1421xxx  is shown in figures 2-6. all the inhibitors
share the same binding mode, as expected, and in a first
inspection all relevant interactions (with the s1′ pocket, the
metal, and the substrate binding groove) are in place. to
emphasize the similarities, all structures are reported with the
same orientation, obtained by least-square fits of all the
coordinates of the adducts to one another. the left-hand column
of figures 2-6 shows the structures of each adduct, and the
central column reports the structure of the adduct with the closest
ligand homologue.

tions at 298 k (see materials and methods), span 2 orders of
magnitude. the associated ∆g° values are reported in table 1.
as described in materials and methods, the protein was used
as an adduct with the weak inhibitor  xxxd66xxx 
(aha). stock protein solutions contained 200 mm aha. at
the final dilution for the fluorimetric assays (1 nm enzyme),
the aha concentration was 5 µm at most, which is well below
the dissociation constant of 6.2 mm estimated through the same
fluorimetric assay. therefore, it may be concluded that aha
does not appreciably interfere with the assays. it can be seen
that there are relevant differences in binding affinities even
between ligands that are very close homologues, i.e., that are
next to one another in figures 2-6.
these results illustrate well the nature of the problem: as
large differences in the binding modes can be immediately ruled
out by visual inspection, the point is to ascertain whether small
differences in the binding mode are at all detectable (the nominal
resolution for the adduct structures obtained in this work range
between 1.2 and 1.7 å, which corresponds to indeterminations
in interatomic distances of (0.10 to (0.15 å) and, if so, whether

these small differences are consistently related with the differences in binding affinity.
careful examination of key interatomic distances and angles
does suggest that indeed not all interactions, despite being all
in place, may be energetically equivalent. for example, on
passing from r1 ) -h (1) to r1 ) -f (2), -och3 (3), -c6h5
(4), van der waals contacts are of course gained in the s1′
pocket, but less optimal h-bond interactions of the so2 group
are seen in all cases. a slight worsening is apparent in the
hydroxamic acid coordination mode in the -och3 derivative,
and a less deep penetration of the first phenyl ring in the s1′
pocket is seen in the -c6h5 derivative. as another example, by
comparing the r1 ) -c6h5, r2 ) -ch2ch2oh, r3 ) -h
derivative (7) with the r1 ) -c6h5, r2 ) -h, r3 ) -h derivative
(4) on one side, and the r1 ) -och3, r2 ) -ch2ch2oh, r3
) -h derivative (6) with the r1 ) -och3, r2 ) -h, r3 ) -h
derivative (3) on the other side, we notice that the addition of
the r2 ) -ch2ch2oh substituent may have opposite effects:
it modestly improves the overall binding of the r1 ) -och3
compound and strongly worsens the binding of the r1 ) -c6h5

compound. inspection of the structures suggests that the
worsening of the affinity of the -c6h5 derivative may be
qualitatively explained by the less optimal binding mode of the
hydroxamic moiety, with an average distance between the two
oxygens being 0.03 å longer, respectively, in the -c6h5 with
respect to the -och3 case. while an increase in binding affinity
upon increasing the size of the r1 substituent in the first example
could have been expected, the reversal in behavior of the r2 )

derivatives was unexpected.

pairs. from careful inspection of the structures, a qualitative
correlation seems to exist between good intermolecular interactions and binding affinity. it is difficult, however, to extend
these considerations to all molecules, especially when some
interactions seem to have improved and other to have been
worsened in the same adduct. in other words, it would be

desirable to have a simpler but reliable way to translate these
observations to contributions to binding. as the individual
interaction strengths can be ultimately traced down to either
hydrophobic or electrostatic effects, we decided to simply
evaluate the hydrophobic and electrostatic contributions to the
overall intermolecular interaction energy by each ligand atom
using standard parameter sets such as those employed in popular
docking programs. among them, the parameter set used by
autodock was selected because of its simple ad hoc treatment
of the ligand metal ion interaction.45 it should be immediately
stressed that we are not using these parameters to estimate
overall, absolute binding energies (see however later) but only
to attach a more quantitative meaning to structural observations
by calculating differences in interatomic interaction energies
between the protein and each atom of different homologous
ligands. by estimating differences, possible biases originating
from crude approximations, for instance those used by autodock
to parametrize the strength of the zinc-hydroxamic ligand
coordination bonds, should largely cancel. furthermore, the
differences are taken between ligands that are very close
homologues, i.e., are next to one another in figures 2-6.
the results are reported in pictorial form on the right-hand
columns of figures 2-6. for each row in these figures, the
ligand forming the adduct reported in the left-hand side of the
figure is drawn, and its atoms are color- and size-coded to show
whether their individual interactions with the protein are stronger
(green) or weaker (red), and by how much (sphere volume),
with respect to those of the corresponding atoms in the central
column adduct. for ligand atoms that do not have a corresponding atom in the homologue compound, their interaction strengths
with the protein are encoded as such. the right-hand columns
of figures 2-6 thus provide an immediate perception of which
atoms may be relevant in determining the differences in affinity
when the structures of closely related ligands are compared.
we have checked that the results of the above procedure are
largely independent of the set of parameters used, suggesting
that the estimated differences in interaction energies are reliable.
a better way to check their reliability is of course to compare
the algebraic sum of all the differences with the difference in
experimental ∆g° values (∆∆g°). this comparison is reported
in figure 7. remarkably, not only are the signs of the ∆∆g°s
predicted correctly in most cases, but their magnitudes are also
reproduced quite well. in only two cases (2-1 and 10-3) is the
calculated sign opposite to the predicted one, but in both cases
the differences are rather close to zero. an entropic penalty may
be further added to the algebraic sum of the individual energetic
terms if, between the two ligands, there is a difference in the
number of rotatable bonds that can be possibly immobilized
upon binding to the protein. for instance, in autodock the
entropic penalty is assigned a default value of 0.31 kcal/mol
per bond. the calculated ∆∆g° in figure 7 takes this contribution into account when deemed present, i.e., when the ligands
to be compared differ in the number of potentially immobilized
rotatable bonds. the lines extending inward or outward of the
calculated ∆∆g° bar values show the results obtained by
neglecting the entropic penalty. it is apparent that the general
trend is maintained whether or not such contribution is taken
into account. solvent effects due to the variations of interface

figure 7. calculated (white bars) and observed (black bars) free energy variations (∆∆g°) on passing from one  xxxg1421xxx  adduct to another with a close
analogue ligand. the calculated ∆∆g° values are the algebraic sum of all the intermolecular interaction energies plus a entropic penalty term related to
immobilization of rotatable bonds as described in materials and methods. the lines extending inward or outward of the calculated ∆∆g° bar values show
the results obtained by neglecting the entropic penalty. the individual intermolecular interaction energy differences are illustrated in figure 2 for ligand pairs
2-1, 3-1, and 4-1, in figure 3 for ligand pairs 5-2, 6-3, and 7-4, in figure 4 for ligand pairs 8-3, 9-3, 10-3, and 11-3, in figure 5 for ligand pairs 10-8 and
11-9, and in figure 6 for ligand pairs 12-3, 13-3, 14-3, and 14-8.

areas buried in the protein-ligand interface also contribute to
the energetics. in other approaches these effects are explicitly
taken into account. in the autodock parametrization, solvent
effects are taken into account implicitly.
in our opinion, the results in figure 7 constitute a strong
validation of the use of energetic considerations to examine the
details of the structure-affinity relationships in this series of
homologous mmp inhibitors. we turn now to describe such
details, to further show that their information content is adequate
to make this approach vital in terms of predictive power for
the refinement of inhibitors toward a particular target.
r1 groups. the first three pairs of experimental ∆∆g° values
in figure 7 show that the substitution of a hydrogen atom in
para position to the phenyl substituent targeted to the hydrophobic s1′ pocket with -f (2), -och3 (3), or a -c6h5 (4) r1
group is essentially neutral, moderately advantageous, and
strongly advantageous, respectively. the corresponding estimated ∆∆g° values (figure 7) agree very well with the
observations, albeit with a slight tendency to overestimate the
improvement. from figure 2a-c it appears that the atoms
involved in improving the binding are mostly the additional
atoms in the r1 group, as expected. the rest of the molecular
scaffold is scarcely affected. however, it is interesting to notice
that the perturbations on the rest of the scaffold are larger in
the -och3 than in the -f derivative, and that they extend as far

as to affect the coordination of the hydroxamic group to the
zinc ion. it is also interesting to note that individual interactions
can both gain and lose strength, with a prevalence of the latter.
this is to be expected as the bulkier the r1 group, the fewer
the degrees of freedom available to the rest of the molecule to
optimize these individual interactions. the worsening of a subset
of other interactions in the rest of the molecule is particularly
apparent for r1 ) -c6h5: its presence does substantially increase
the total hydrophobic interactions in the s1′ pocket but at the
same time decreases the hydrophobic interactions of the first
phenyl ring (right-hand side of figure 2c). as noticed already
by comparing the left and central panels in figure 2c, the
presence of the second ring apparently prevents the first phenyl
ring from entering the s1′ pocket as deeply as in the unsubstituted derivative. also the other qualitative observations made
by comparing the structures in panels a-c in figure 2 are
confirmed: -f introduces the least perturbations, slightly
worsening the hydrophobic interactions in the s1′ pocket and
the hydrogen bonds of the so2 group, while in the -och3
derivative an appreciable worsening is transmitted to the
hydroxamic moiety, and in the -c6h5 derivative there is a modest
but clear decrease of the hydrophobic interactions of the first
phenyl ring with the s1′ pocket.

atom in position r2 with -ch2ch2oh was investigated. the
alcoholic substituent in r2 slightly improves the binding to the
enzyme for the first two derivatives and sizably worsens the
binding for the third. again, the estimated ∆∆g° values agree
very well with the observations (figure 7). panels a-c in
figure 3 provide a rationale for the different behavior. in
summary, in all three cases the r2 substituent provides an
appreciable contribution to binding, especially through hydrophobic interactions of the two additional ch2 groups. for r1
) -f this is accompanied by a modest worsening of the
hydroxamic coordination strength. conversely, for r1 ) -och3
the hydroxamic coordination is actually slightly improved, and
a modest worsening of the hydrophobic contact of the phenyl
ring is seen. thus, in no case a perfect fit is achieved. it is
interesting to note that the nonperfect fits for the two different
molecules lead to different compromises for the interactions with
the three enzyme subsites: for r1 ) -f, the interaction is
optimized for the hydrophobic pocket and the substrate binding
groove, while the binding to zinc is sacrificed. for r1 ) -och3
the interaction is optimized for the binding to zinc and to the
substrate binding groove, while the binding to the hydrophobic
pocket is sacrificed.
unexpectedly, the r2 ) -ch2ch2oh substitution has a
sizable destabilizing effect on the r1 ) -c6h5 scaffold. in this
case, the binding to zinc is strongly worsened, and the additional
interactions established by the alcoholic r2 group do not
compensate for the loss of interaction strength of the zincbinding group. apparently, a sizable steric misfit is being faced
in this derivative. figure 2c shows that there is almost no
perturbation of the hydrophobic interactions of the biphenyl
group with respect to those experienced by the same group in
the r2 ) -h derivative. this suggests that the two phenyl rings
together are held so tightly in the s1′ pocket that the steric
perturbation introduced by the r2 substituent on the sulfonamide
nitrogen, which is apparently tolerated in the r1 ) -f and r1
) -och3 derivatives, is not tolerated by the r1 ) -c6h5
derivative. as a consequence, a serious mismatch of the
hydroxamic moiety in the zinc subsite occurs. it should be
recalled that the hydroxamic group, if free to optimize its
orientation, is very specifically tailored for the mmp active site,
featuring bidentate binding to zinc together with two strong
hydrogen bonds, one with the carboxylate side chain of the
active site glu-219 and one with the peptide carbonyl group of
ala-182.
r3 ) -d, xxxd3193xxx  or -d, xxxd3361xxx . the effect of these substituents
(8-11) has been examined on the scaffold having r1 ) -och3.
the d stereoisomers have higher affinity, and the l stereoisomers
lower affinity, for  xxxg1421xxx  with respect to the r3 ) -h scaffold
(figure 7). examination of figure 4a-d again provides a full
rationale for this behavior: the d-isomers, besides providing
additional binding interactions with the r3 group, also exert a
slight stabilizing effect on the hydroxamic moiety. the stabilization is somewhat larger for the d-thr derivative but is accompanied by a modest weakening of the sulfonamide nitrogen
interactions, so that the overall gain in affinity is slightly lower
for the d-thr (9) than for the  xxxd5xxx  (8) derivative. in the  xxxd3193xxx 
stereoisomer (10) the stabilizing effect on the hydroxamic
moiety is estimated to be essentially lost, leading to a very small
overall stabilization effect, while the experimental ∆∆g°
indicates an overall modest destabilization. finally, the behavior

of the r3 )  xxxd3361xxx  (11) is strikingly different, both the experiment
and the computational estimate showing a strong destabilization.
figure 5a,b shows that the  xxxd3361xxx  group actually has slightly
more stabilizing interactions that the d-thr group; however, its
stereochemistry causes an appreciable distortion of the scaffold
that apparently strongly destabilizes both the hydroxamic moiety
and the sulfonamide nh and so2 groups. again, it is remarkable
that the experimental ∆∆g° trend is reproduced so well by these
simple calculations (figure 7).
figure 7 also shows the direct differences between the l and
d isomers and confirms the analysis. in the case of the ser
derivatives (8, 10) the l isomer slightly stabilizes the ser itself
and mainly destabilizes the hydroxamic moiety, while in the
case of the thr derivatives (9, 11) the thr itself is slightly
stabilized, but the hydroxamic moiety and the sulfonamide nh
and so2 groups are substantially destabilized. this direct
comparison between the l and d isomers is of course redundant,
because the effects could have been deduced from the preceding
panels of figure 7. however, it is instructive because the ∆∆g°
values in this latter comparison are by definition free from
solvent-ligand interactions and essentially free also from
solvent-protein interactions. in other words, the ∆∆g° values
almost purely reflect ligand-protein interactions.
r2 ) -ch2ch(ch3)2; r2 ) -ch2chohch2oh with r3
t -h, -ch2oh. having established that the -och3 substitution
in r1 allows substituents in either r2 or r3 to increase the overall
affinity for  xxxg1421xxx , the relative effects of hydrophobic vs
hydrophilic substituents in r2 was investigated for r1 ) -och3,
both in the absence (-h) or in the presence (-ch2oh) of a
substituent in r3 with a d configuration. the experimental and
predicted ∆∆g° values for hydrophobic (12) vs hydrophilic (13)
r2 are shown in figure 7, and the calculated energetics of the
individual interactions are reported in figure 6a-d. the
estimated sign of the effect is again correct, i.e., both r2 groups
are predicted and found to stabilize the r1 ) -och3, r2 ) -h,
r3 ) -h scaffold, although the stabilizing effect is somewhat
overestimated for the hydrophobic substituent and underestimated for the hydrophilic substituent. in the first case, figure
6a shows that the hydrophobic substituent has by itself a strong
stabilizing effect, on top of which a non-negligible stabilization
of the hydroxamic moiety is also observed. in the second case
(figure 6b), the stabilizing effect of the r2 substituent is smaller,
but the stabilizing effect on the hydroxamic moiety is maintained. these findings are consistent with what observed for
the r2 ) -ch2ch2oh case already discussed: it can be
concluded that for r1 ) -och3 (but not r1 ) -f or r1 ) -c6h5)
any substituent at r2 improves the binding of the hydroxamic
group. with this in mind, the derivative with r2 ) -ch2chohch2oh and r3 ) -ch2oh simultaneously present (14)
was tested. these r2 and r3 groups, taken separately, both
improved the binding of the starting r1 ) -och3 scaffold.
figure 7 shows that the effect is not synergistic, the improvement
being of the same order of each substituent separately, and
actually slightly smaller than that caused by the r3 ) -ch2oh
substituent alone. again, the calculations are in qualitative
agreement in all cases. figure 6c,d surprisingly shows that the
hydroxamic moiety and the so2 groups are both improved by
the simultaneous presence of the two substituents, but each
substituent adopts a less optimal set of interactions with the
protein, essentially neutralizing the improvement.

implications for drug-design strategies. the above analysis demonstrates that the availability of high-resolution structures
of a series of enzyme adducts with homologous ligands provides
precious information on the subtle factors that modulate ligand
affinity and thus may be of much help in the optimization of
such ligands. for instance, increasing the size of the hydrophobic
group in the s1′ pocket increases the affinity but only provided
that no substituents are placed in r2 and r3 positions.
conversely, a smaller hydrophobic group such as the one with
r1 ) -och3 permits the insertion of other groups, including
more hydrophilic groups, in r2 and r3, provided their local
effect is not destabilizing. one could even conceive substitutions
in r1, r2, and r3 that strongly destabilize the hydroxamic moiety
but provide enough local stabilization to partially compensate
for the loss. under such circumstances, the substitution of the
now unfit hydroxamic moiety with a more druggable group with
a better fit could provide enough extra stabilization to obtain
nanomolar affinity for a non-hydroxamic ligand. for example,
we predict that a non-hydroxamic ligand could provide a
reasonable binding affinity in the case of 7, which displays a
nonoptimal fit of the hydroxamic moiety (figure 3). regarding
the r2 and r3 substituents, the present results also show that
hydrophilic substitutions are not severely disfavored with respect
to hydrophobic substitutions, as commonly assumed for this
class of molecules. furthermore, as other mmps such as
 xxxg1422xxx  have a larger binding site, one could exploit the present
findings to test ligands with substituents in, e.g., r1, r2, that
show more or less pronounced steric misfit in  xxxg1421xxx  for
improved selectivity for  xxxg1422xxx . indeed, ∆g° data on binding
of selected ligands to  xxxg1422xxx  confirm the correctness of the
approach (figure 8): adding an r2 ) ch2ch2oh to the r1 )
och3 or r1 ) c6h5 scaffolds stabilizes the adduct with  xxxg1422xxx 
more, or destabilizes it less, than the corresponding adduct with
 xxxg1421xxx , resulting in both cases in an increased selectivity for
 xxxg1422xxx . of course, if suitable crystals for ligand soaking were
available for other mmps, the potential of this strategy would
be further enhanced. finally, the degree of prediction achieved
with the present strategy should help avoiding the extensive
screening of substituents in n different positions (r1, r2, and
r3 in this case) by examining a full n-dimensional matrix of
compounds. indeed, once the interplay among a certain set of
substituents shows that one position is disfavored, examining
further substitutions in that position with the chosen set of
substituents can be avoided.

it should be stressed that the above findings have only been
made possible by the availability of experimental structures.
while docking programs are able to provide reasonable models
of ligand binding modes, especially in the presence of existing
structures with homologous ligands, the accuracy of the resulting
models is lower than that of experimental structures, and
insufficient for the present purpose. this has been tested by
taking the high-resolution (1.1 å) crystal structure of  xxxg1421xxx 
and using it to dock all the inhibitors described in this work.
despite the overall binding mode always being correct, the
details of the interatomic distances were not accurate enough
to make any energetic predictions. one drawback is the use of
the same protein structure for all adducts, while the present work
shows that the protein structures differ slightly from one another
in the various adducts, as a consequence of some mutual
adaptation or “induced fit”. attempts to mimic this induced fit,
either by allowing protein side-chain movements during docking
or by overall (i.e., ligand and protein) restrained energy
minimization of the final adduct did not improve the energetic
predictions significantly (data not shown). on the other hand,
it is reassuring that the choice of the set of potentials to extract
energetic information from the experimental structures is not
critical, as different popular potential sets provide similar results.
thermodynamics of ligand binding. of course, it is wellknown that the relationship between ∆g° and intermolecular
potential energy calculations is totally empirical, although it is
often found to hold.46-48 there are two reasons to question its
applicability. the first reason is that contributions to ∆g° from
solvent-ligand, solvent-protein, and solvent-adduct interactions are not taken into account. however, it can be speculated
that, at least in systems of this kind, solvation effects are not
so strong, and there is always partial cancellation between
solvent effects on the reactants and the product. furthermore,
in our approach ∆∆g° values are estimated, so the differential
solvent-protein effects are zero, and the other two terms are
likely to be further reduced. in one case, i.e., the comparison
between the behavior of the d- and l- isomers substituted in
r2, solvent effects on the ligands are also zero, and the
differential solvent-adduct effects are probably negligibly small.
it is obvious that the striking difference in binding affinity

between the r2d d-thr and r2 )  xxxd3361xxx  is almost entirely due
to the difference in protein-ligand interaction.
the second reason is that, even if the leading term is the
free energy of the protein-ligand interaction, the latter is still
composed by enthalpic and entropic terms, and intermolecular
interaction energy calculations only take into account the
enthalpic term (except for a modest correction for possible
differences in number of immobilized rotatable bonds). prompted
by these considerations, ∆h° values for the binding of some of
the present ligands were measured through isothermal titration
calorimetry (itc). two other well-known strong mmp ligands,
actinonin and  xxxd2329xxx  (biomol inc.), were also studied for
comparison purposes.
itc measurements. isothermal titration calorimetry is
widely used in drug discovery, since it permits an accurate and
extensive thermodynamic characterization of protein-ligand
interactions.49,50 in particular, itc measurements have already
been successfully exploited to design and characterize stromelysin inhibitors.51,52
all measurements were performed at 298 k. at variance with
fluorimetric assays, here the protein concentrations were much
higher (20 µm), and the aha concentration was correspondingly higher (4 mm). this concentration is comparable with
the dissociation constant of aha itself. therefore, aha
interferes with the binding of the inhibitors, and the experimental
∆h° values are conditional values. a proper estimate of the
∆h° for aha was needed, both to obtain the true ∆h° values
for the other inhibitors and to obtain thermodynamic parameters
of aha itself. a series of itc measurements on the binding of
the 3 (r1 ) och3, r2 ) h) were thus performed in the presence
of various aha concentrations in the range 1 to 256 mm. by
fitting the obtained enthalpy as a function of aha concentration,
a ∆h° of -3.180 kcal/mol was found for the binding of aha.
the latter parameter provides an experimental estimate of the
enthalpic contribution of the metal binding group to the overall
binding of all the inhibitors investigated here, as well as of all
hydroxamic-based inhibitors in general, to  xxxg1421xxx . furthermore, the aha ∆h° value allowed us to estimate the correction
to apply to the other ∆h° values. the corrected thermodynamic
parameters of some of the inhibitors investigated here, as well
as those of aha, are reported in table 1.
although itc measurements performed at increasing inhibitor
concentrations as in the present experimental scheme also
provide estimates of the dissociation constants, the latter are
affected by large errors when the constants approach nanomolar
values, and so are the derived ∆g° values. conversely, the ∆h°
values are not affected by such errors. therefore, estimates of
-t∆s° values were obtained by using the corrected ∆h° values
from calorimetry and the ∆g° values from fluorimetry measurements. the -t∆s° values are also reported in table 1. the
binding constants derived from itc measurements (not shown)
were in any case within a factor two with respect to the
fluorimetric values.
from the ∆h° and -t∆s° values reported in table 1 it
appears that the free energy of binding of all the homologous

ligands examined in this work contain an important enthalpic
contribution and a less important but sizable entropic contribution, both favorable to binding. this appears a general feature
for this class of ligands but is by no means general for other
inhibitors of mmps. for instance,  xxxd2329xxx  and actinonin, two
well-known strong inhibitors of mmps, show much less
favorable, or even unfavorable, enthalpic contributions, respectively, and much more favorable entropic terms (table 1).
by examination of the ∆h° values in table 1, no apparent
correlation can be seen with the corresponding ∆g° values,
neither with the intermolecular interaction energies estimated
from the experimental structures in the present homologous
series of ligands; nor do the differences ∆∆h° correlate better
with the ∆∆g°. apparently, the enthalpies (and entropies) of
the ligand-solvent interactions are sizable and vary in a rather
unpredictable way, while they largely cancel each other to give
a modest contribution to ∆g°. apparently, this is yet another
manifestation of the well-known entropy-enthalpy cancelation
phenomenon.
an interesting finding from itc measurements is the fact
that, as already observed for stromelysin,52 the binding of aha
to  xxxg1421xxx  (and thus presumably to all others mmps) is almost
exclusively enthalpy-driven. the ∆h° value of about -3.2 kcal/
mol for this ligand having millimolar affinity is only two to
three times smaller than the binding enthalpy of nanomolar
affinity ligands, which is a relevant contribution. the -t∆s
value for aha is close to zero. this relatively strong contribution to the overall binding enthalpy could be even higher if the
ligand solvent contribution were not unfavorable, as it is
expected to be for the very soluble aha molecule. indeed, in
our parametrization, the estimated contribution of the aha
moiety to the overall protein-ligand interaction energy has to
be as high as -6 kcal/mol if a reasonable estimate of the overall
interaction energy for this class of ligands has to be obtained.
this is not unexpected, as it is well-known that, if aha is
considered a fragment of a strong binding ligand rather than an
independent molecule, the loss of rigid body rotational and
traslational entropy upon binding occurs only once and not twice
as it would be for the isolated fragments. the corresponding
gain in ∆g°, which is parametrically incorporated in the
interaction energy in our calculations, can easily be of the order
of -3 kcal/ mol.52-54

conclusion

in summary, it is shown here that an analysis of the details
of the protein-ligand interactions, as they appear from the threedimensional structures in terms of simple hydrophobic and
electrostatic contributions, provides a remarkable semiquantitative account of (i) the ∆g° values of the adducts, (ii) the
differences in ∆g° (∆∆g°) between pairs of closely related
ligands, and (iii) the identity of the individual ligand atomprotein atom interactions that contribute in each case to increase,
or decrease, the affinity of each particular ligand with respect
to its closest analogue. this work demonstrates that this kind
of rationalization is possible and reliable and provides hints for

matrix metalloproteinases

the planning of finely tuned inhibitors, originating from the same
scaffold, for any structurally well-characterized biological target.
for some of the present ligands, the enthalpies of binding
(∆h°) were also measured through isothermal calorimetry. all
the ligands from this class are found to be characterized by
favorable enthalpic as well as entropic contributions. the
enthalpic contribution of the hydroxamic moiety, a popular zincbinding group in the mmp inhibitor landscape, has been
separately evaluated and discussed in terms of its relative
contribution to the potency of hydroxamic-based mmp ligands.
a detailed analysis of the ∆h° and ∆s° values, taken separately,
is less instructive, due to the well-known entropy-enthalpy
compensation effects.49 as in many other thermodynamic

articles

studies, the two terms are found to provide opposite and largely
canceling contributions to ∆g°.
