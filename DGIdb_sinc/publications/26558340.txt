prevention of preterm birth with vaginal progesterone
or 17-alpha- xxxd2303xxx  caproate:
a critical examination of efficacy and safety
john m. o’brien, md; david f. lewis, md, mba

t

he only class of medication to
demonstrate signiﬁcant reductions
repeatedly in the rate of early preterm birth
are progestogens,  xxxd3023xxx  or
the synthetic 17- xxxd2303xxx 
caproate ( xxxd2303xxx ).1,2 published guidelines have provided recommendations
regarding their use.3-5 these agents are
prescribed in asymptomatic patients who
are at increased risk for spontaneous preterm birth that was determined by obstetric history or a sonographic short
cervix. the risk for recurrent preterm birth
varies depending on the gestational age at
previous delivery, number of previous
preterm births, whether an intervening
term delivery has occurred, and the classiﬁcation of the previous preterm birth as
either spontaneous or indicated.6-9 the
risk for preterm birth based on the cervical
length also varies based on the gestational
age a short cervix is identiﬁed and the
population in which the measurement is
obtained.10-12 deﬁning an optimal strategy
for preterm birth prevention based on a
risk factor or a biomarker for a presumed
pathophysiologic process (a decline in
progesterone action) or both can improve
the risk-beneﬁt ratio, lower health care
costs, and enhance translation of scientiﬁc
ﬁndings along particular paths.13,14

progestogens are the first drugs to demonstrate reproducibly a reduction in the rate of
early preterm birth. the efficacy and safety of progestogens are related to individual
pharmacologic properties of each drug within this class of medication and characteristics
of the population that is treated. the synthetic 17- xxxd2303xxx  caproate and
 xxxd3023xxx  have been studied with the use of a prophylactic strategy in women
with a history of preterm birth and in women with a multiple gestation. evidence from a
single large comparative efficacy trial suggests that vaginal  xxxd3023xxx  is
superior to 17- xxxd2303xxx  caproate as a prophylactic treatment in women with
a history of mid-trimester preterm birth. progestogen therapy is indicated for women with
this highest risk profile based on evidence from 2 trials. a therapeutic approach based on
the identification of a sonographic short cervix has been studied in several phase iii trials.
independent phase iii trials and an individual patient metaanalysis suggest that vaginal
progesterone is efficacious and safe in women with a singleton and a short cervix. two
trials that tested 17- xxxd2303xxx  caproate in women with a short cervix showed
no benefit. no consistent benefit for the prophylactic or therapeutic use of progestogens
has been demonstrated in larger trials of women whose pregnancies were complicated
by a multiple gestation (twins or triplets), preterm labor, or preterm rupture of membranes. unfortunately, several large randomized trials in multiple gestations have
identified harm related to 17- xxxd2303xxx  caproate exposure, and the synthetic
drug is contraindicated in this population. the current body of evidence is evaluated by
the grading of recommendations assessment, development, and evaluation guidelines
to derive the strength of recommendation in each of these populations. a large confirmatory trial that is testing 17- xxxd2303xxx  caproate exposure in women with a
singleton pregnancy and a history of preterm birth is near completion. additional study of
the efficacy and safety of progestogens is suggested in well-selected populations based
on the presence of biomarkers.

drug development pathways initially
have focused on selecting candidate
compounds by generating an animal
model of disease or by deﬁning molecular responses to exposures. subsequent
phase i and ii studies provide information regarding pharmacokinetics, dose
response, initial safety observations, and
the potential to alter clinically meaningful endpoints (see glossary of terms).
ideally, phase iii trials should then
evaluate efﬁcacy and safety in a wellselected candidate population to yield
signiﬁcant improvement in the best
chosen, clinically important outcome.
after efﬁcacy is validated (often by
replication), the indication for use may
be expanded by additional trials that
consider the effectiveness and safety
proﬁle of the intervention. this
sequence for drug development was not
used when exploring the efﬁcacy of
progestogens to prevent preterm birth;
indeed, this systematic approach has
been used rarely in obstetrics. hence,
interventions in obstetrics should undergo more frequent reevaluation while
being implemented into clinical practice.
this review addresses the efﬁcacy and
safety of progestogen use, given recent
experimental observations regarding
pharmacodynamics and the evolving
understanding of risk-beneﬁt provided
from trials and metaanalysis.

glossary
phase i trial
a study early in the development process
of an intervention aimed to describe
pharmacokinetics, suggest optimal dose,
identify remarkable harms/frequent
adverse events, or establish the feasibility
of treatment.
phase ii trial
a study aimed to estimate the activity of
the drug (explore surrogate endpoints),
compare dosing schedules to alter pharmacodynamics, or provide an estimate
for demonstrating signiﬁcant differences
in clinically important endpoints.
phase iii trial
a study aimed to demonstrate superiority of an intervention (over placebo or
other comparator) to alter clinically

ajog.org
important endpoints or noninferiority
(an intervention is no worse than
another by a speciﬁed margin), in
conjunction with an aim to better deﬁne
the frequency of adverse events or harm.
to accomplish both aims, phase iii
studies most commonly have a sample
size in the hundreds or thousands.
pharmacodynamics
a study aimed at the inclusion of any
observed changes within the body that
are related to a drug exposure.
efﬁcacy
this is a function of a test article under
idealized circumstances in which the
exposure is more controlled by investigators who include stricter inclusion and exclusion criteria, standardized
provider skill assessment or testing, and
uniform response to clinical circumstances. this determination is potentially a product of phase iii trials.
effectiveness
this is a function of a test article under
clinical use conditions. this determination is potentially a product of trials with
pragmatic design features that include
limited exclusion criteria and few restrictions on additional therapies in
response to clinical circumstances.

pharmacodynamics and their
implications for treatment
the mechanism of action for supplemental progestogens to improve pregnancy outcome likely relies on increased
interaction between progesterone receptors and their ligands. presumably,
the enhanced receptor-ligand interaction alters 1 hormone-mediated
physiologic properties aimed at
meeting the dynamic functional demands placed on tissues of the reproductive tract during pregnancy. each
tissue of the reproductive tract, the
chorioamniotic membranes, and the
fetus express progesterone receptors
with potential physiologic activities.15-17
the potential to augment cellular and
tissue functions that are mediated by
progesterone receptors beyond that
achievable by the hormone that is produced from the preterm placenta alone

has been termed the progestogen
hypothesis.18
if increasing the bioavailability of
progesterone for its receptors within the
reproductive tract is the therapeutic
target, then this goal may be realized
through supplementation that increases
concentration within these target tissues
or by reduction of progesterone degradation. therefore, a potential alternative
site of action for progestogens is within
the liver. caritis et al19 reported a linear,
highly signiﬁcant positive correlation
between serum  xxxd2303xxx  concentration
and serum progesterone concentration
(r2 ¼ 0.46; p < .0001). an association
between  xxxd2303xxx  exposure and an
increased serum progesterone concentration has also been observed in 2 animal models, 1 of which was a primate
model (both p < .01).20,21 furthermore,
 xxxd2303xxx  and progesterone have been
shown to competitively interact with the
 xxxg590xxx  enzyme (cyp
3a4) in human liver microsome preparations.22 of note, supplemental progestogens do not act to increase the
placental production of progesterone or
cross-react with other steroid hormone
receptors.19,23 therefore, data support 2
potential sites of action for progestogens
to enhance the progesterone receptorligand interaction; however, each strategy may have different capabilities to
alter progesterone actions within the
reproductive tract.
both progesterone and  xxxd2303xxx  have
been shown to alter  xxxg1737xxx 
and cellular activity, but the relative binding afﬁnity of  xxxd2303xxx  for nuclear progesterone receptors a and b is only 26-30%
that of  xxxd3023xxx .23-25 this
lower binding afﬁnity raises the question
whether this synthetic drug can act with
equal efﬁcacy as  xxxd3023xxx  to
inﬂuence receptor-mediated activities
directly within the reproductive tract. in
addition to the pharmacologic properties
of these drugs and their site of action, other
factors inﬂuence treatment response to
progestogens. the population that is
treated is the most important consideration because a variation in response to
these agents has been demonstrated in
different populations. furthermore,
within populations, individual patient

characteristics appear to alter the effectiveness of this treatment strategy. in support of the latter construct, manuck et al26
demonstrated a variable response to 17ohpc exposure, based on the  xxxg1737xxx  genotype.
in an informative experiment in a
pregnant murine model, nold et al20
assessed differences in gene transcription after supplemental progesterone or
 xxxd2303xxx  exposure in select pathways
that are implicated in the pathophysiology of preterm delivery. the effects of
 xxxd2303xxx  and progesterone in the cervix
and myometrium were assessed. these
investigators found progesterone, but
not  xxxd2303xxx , had a treatment effect
that was localized to the cervix. specifically, defensin-1, an antimicrobial peptide, was signiﬁcantly up-regulated by
supplemental progesterone exposure.
these data suggest that a potential relationship exists among mucosal integrity,
inﬂammation, cervical remodeling,
spontaneous preterm labor, and this
treatment.
a detailed series of experiments that
tested the immune response to supplemental progestogens was performed
recently by furcron et al27 again in a
pregnant murine model. these investigators also observed that vaginal
progesterone, but not  xxxd2303xxx , was
associated with beneﬁcial effects. the
immune response to  xxxd3023xxx  alone resulted in a signiﬁcant increase in the proportion of decidual
cd4þ tregs, a reduction in the proportion of macrophages in decidual tissues, and a reduction of active mmp-9þ
cells in the cervix. furthermore, vaginal
progesterone was shown to protect
against endotoxin-induced preterm
birth (effect size, 50%; p ¼ .0008).
although additional study of supplemental progestogens is needed, current
evidence suggests that the alteration in
the immune response is an important
mechanism of action for these agents.
a paucity of experimental data is
available to describe the effects of supplemental progestogens on human tissues at preterm gestational ages. the
treatment response to a dose of supplemental progestogens may differ
throughout gestation because placental

production of the hormone varies so
remarkably based on gestational age.28 a
study by ruddock et al29 incubated
myometrial strips that were obtained
from term cesarean deliveries with
different progestogens. progesterone
treatment was found to induce relaxation of the smooth muscle;  xxxd2303xxx 
exposure stimulated myometrial activity. another study from term cesarean
deliveries by kumar et al30 noted that
exposure to progesterone signiﬁcantly
reduced membrane weakening.
in summary, the experimental observations in human tissue and animal
models demonstrate that (1) sites of action within the reproductive tract and
liver are possible after exposure to these
distinct progestogens, (2) the cervix or
decidua are likely primary targets to
prevent preterm birth by these agents,
but other activities are possible, and (3)
 xxxd3023xxx  may be the superior progestogen to alter gene transcription and cellular physiologies to
vary the immune response to prevent
spontaneous preterm birth.
clinical trial data that has assessed
pharmacodynamic responses to supplemental progestogens has focused on
cervical length measurement. a planned
secondary analysis of the largest trial to
date measured cervical length at enrollment and at 28 weeks gestation in
asymptomatic singletons.31 the difference in measurement at these timepoints was signiﬁcantly smaller, and the
cervical length at 28 weeks gestation was
signiﬁcantly longer in women who were
treated with progesterone. a slower rate
of cervical change was also demonstrated
in a randomized trial testing a higher
dose of  xxxd2303xxx  (682 mg/wk) in a
symptomatic population with an
episode of preterm labor.32 however, 2
retrospective studies that evaluated prophylactic treatment with 250 mg/wk of
 xxxd2303xxx  did not identify a treatment
effect on cervical length but did not
study differences in the rate of cervical
change.33,34 regarding myometrial activity, a large observational study
demonstrated a signiﬁcant increase in
contraction frequency after exposure to
 xxxd2303xxx , whereas  xxxd3023xxx 
exposure has been shown to signiﬁcantly

is there evidence of superiority
287
between progestogens?
288
given its results, the phase iii study by
289
meis et al38 stimulated design and
290
execution of numerous additional large
291
trials that tested progestogens in a variety
292
of populations. a signiﬁcant reduction
293
in recurrent preterm birth (36.3% vs
294
54.9%; relative risk [rr], 0.66 [95%
295
conﬁdence interval (ci), 0.54e0.81])
296
was demonstrated with exposure to 17297
ohpc in addition to fewer deliveries at
298
<35 weeks gestation (20.6% vs 30.7%;
299
rr, 0.67 [95% ci, 0.48e0.93]).
300
although this trial demonstrated efﬁ301
cacy, several concerns have been identi302
ﬁed that include an imbalance between
303
study groups, patient selection and
304
generalizability of its conclusions
305
because of the higher rate of preterm
306
birth in the placebo group compared
307
with other prospective observational
308
studies, and the vehicle (castor oil) for
309
this progestogen. despite randomiza310
tion, the women in the placebo group
311
had a signiﬁcantly higher mean number
312
of previous preterm births (1.6  0.9 vs
313
1.4  0.7; p ¼ .007) and a signiﬁcantly
314
greater percentage of these women had
315
>1 previous preterm delivery before
316
enrollment, (41.2% vs 27.7%; p ¼ .004
317
by chi square based on data presented in
318
table 1). a conﬁrmatory phase iii trial ½t1 319
was required by the food and drug
320
administration (fda) for its current
321
conditional approval, given these con322
cerns. this study has a planned enroll323
ment of 1707 women and is intended to
324
replicate the efﬁcacy of  xxxd2303xxx  as a
325
prophylactic treatment in women with a
326
history of preterm birth. (the pro327
long trial-clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/
328
nct01004029) this study will also
329
better assess the safety of the drug in
330
singleton gestations, given its planned
331
sample size.
332
the fda has also evaluated vaginal
333
progesterone that is indicated for
334
women with a sonographic short

decrease contraction frequency.35,36
therefore, clinical data also suggest that
these 2 compounds should not be
considered equivalent regarding their
actions on the reproductive tract
functions.37

cervix.39 the marketing of  xxxd3023xxx  that is indicated for this
biomarker was not approved. in their
analysis, the agency publicly focused on
treatment site interaction, the selection
of statistical tests, and potential confounding variables. an independent review of the trial data differed from the
fda analysis and noted treatment
beneﬁt.40 unfortunately, data from
phase iii trials by fonseca et al41 and
o’brien et al42 was discounted during
the review process, and a participant
level metaanalysis by romero et al43 was
also inappropriately criticized. to date,
the actions of the fda regarding progestogens have resulted in approval of a
synthetic hormone that is indicated for a
risk factor, but the parent natural hormone remains unapproved when indicated for a well-validated biomarker.
therefore, these regulatory actions may
have given the impression that 17ohpc is the superior progestogen and
that a treatment strategy based on a
prophylactic approach is better. however, further assessment is needed.
the largest comparative efﬁcacy trial
to date that has tested the relative efﬁcacy
of progestogens for preterm birth prevention was performed by maher et al.44
this trial enrolled women with more
selective inclusion criteria and who were
at greater risk for recurrent preterm
birth. inclusion criteria included (1) had
a history of 1 mid-trimester preterm
births or (2) had a cerclage suture placed
in a previous pregnancy. cerclage was
indicated per their protocol for an obstetric history of 2 mid-trimester preterm births or cerclage placement in a
previous pregnancy. women with a short
cervix <25 mm at <19 weeks gestation
and those with or planning a cervical
cerclage were excluded. this trial
enrolled 518 women; outcomes were
available for 253 participants who were
administered 90 mg vaginal progesterone daily and 249 participants who underwent weekly intramuscular injections
of 250 mg  xxxd2303xxx . the compliance
with each treatment was excellent. a
signiﬁcant reduction in preterm birth at
<34 weeks gestation was observed with
supplemental vaginal progesterone
(16.6% vs 25.7%; rr, 0.58; 95% ci,

0.37e0.89; p ¼ .02), and signiﬁcantly
lower rates of delivery at <32 and <28
weeks gestation were secondary ﬁndings.
pregnancy duration was in favor of  xxxd3023xxx  by kaplan-meier
analysis (p ¼ .0023). finally, the number of neonatal intensive care unit admissions was lower with progesterone
(15.4% vs 25.7; p ¼.006). therefore, this
study found that the efﬁcacy of vaginal
progesterone was superior to 17ohp-c
in the prevention of recurrent preterm
birth in a higher risk, compliant
population.
one potential explanation for
decreased efﬁcacy of the synthetic drug is
that dosing at 630 mg/week of natural
progesterone was administered vs 250
mg/week of  xxxd2303xxx . in support of this
concern, caritis et al45 found that the
women in the lowest quartile of serum
 xxxd2303xxx  concentration had higher
rates of recurrent preterm birth. these
data suggest, for singletons, that the
optimal dose of  xxxd2303xxx  has not been
identiﬁed and may vary based on factors
such as body mass index, coexisting drug
exposures, or innate differences in hepatic metabolism that may alter the
serum concentration of this synthetic
progestogen and/or  xxxd3023xxx .45,46 if monitoring serum  xxxd2303xxx 
concentration is ultimately deemed
necessary to optimize treatment, then
intramuscular dosing of this synthetic
drug will be more difﬁcult and costly.
the vaginal route of drug delivery likely
results in a greater concentration of
supplemental progesterone within the
uterus and cervix compared with serum
if vaginal absorption during pregnancy is
similar to nonpregnant women. a “ﬁrst
uterine pass effect” has been documented in nonpregnant women.47,48
the comparative efﬁcacy study by
maher et al44 also addresses a potential
misperception that these individual
progestogens are exclusively efﬁcacious
in particular populations that are at risk.
because both of these progestogens are
members of the same class of drugs,
most likely ultimately targeting changes
in cellular and tissue physiology that is
mediated via similar receptors, natural
progesterone has the potential to alter
outcomes in patients who are at risk like

expert review

 xxxd2303xxx . clinical trials that tested a q3
prophylactic strategy in women with a
history of preterm birth likely have
enrolled heterogeneous groups of
women with differing pathways that led
to their birth histories that may explain
some variation in trial ﬁndings. the
negative progesterone trial by o’brien
et al42 was not powered to assess efﬁcacy
in the subpopulation of women with a
history of mid-trimester preterm birth
and selection bias that was related to
cervical length measurement at enrollment likely reduced the number of
women who could respond to the
intervention.

indications for vaginal progesterone
and  xxxd2303xxx 
a history of preterm birth, a sonographic
short cervix, or both clinical problems
have served to provide indication for this
intervention.49 as noted previously,
women at highest risk with a history of
mid-trimester preterm birth should
undergo prophylaxis with a progestogen.
however, women with a history of later
spontaneous preterm birth in the third
trimester may not require this intervention. o’brien et al42 and defranco et al50
evaluated treatment response in the
largest randomized trial performed to
date in singletons. in this study, prevention of recurrent preterm birth was
not demonstrated with progesterone
treatment based on historic factors
alone, but a treatment response was
identiﬁed when cervical length was used
to stratify the population.50 this investigation identiﬁed a therapeutic effect to
prolong gestation in women with a history of preterm birth who had a cervical
length of 30 mm (n ¼ 116; p ¼ .04).
therefore, women with a history of
spontaneous preterm birth in the third
trimester who undergo cervical surveillance and have a cervical length >30 mm
may not beneﬁt because a positive
treatment response has not been replicated for this subpopulation.
the importance of cervical length in
deﬁning the indication for treatment in
asymptomatic patients has been veriﬁed
by 2 other phase iii trials that tested a
universal screening strategy. fonseca
et al41 and hassan et al51 demonstrated

that treatment that is indicated for a
sonographic short cervix can reduce the
rate of early preterm birth in women
who undergo a universal screening
strategy by transvaginal ultrasound
scanning. romero et al43 also quantiﬁed
a 42% reduction using this strategy in an
individual patient-level metaanalysis.
unfortunately, 2 large trials that tested
 xxxd2303xxx  in asymptomatic women with
a short cervix did not identify beneﬁt in
groups with either a high-risk or lowrisk proﬁle for preterm birth.52,53
furthermore, the study by grobman
et al52 did not observe a therapeutic effect in the subpopulation of low-risk
women with the shortest cervical
lengths, <15 mm. rozenberg et al54 also
did not demonstrate beneﬁt with 17ohpc exposure in a randomized trial
of symptomatic patients with a short
cervix. therefore, vaginal progesterone
appears to be the superior progestogen
for women with a sonographic short
cervix. other biomarkers in concert with
cervical length measurement ultimately
may facilitate a better deﬁnition for
treatment indication and of treatment
response.
the most conﬁdent conclusion that
can be made from randomized trials that
have been performed to date is that
prophylactic progestogen exposure in
women with a multiple gestation in unselected cohorts is ineffective and
potentially harmful when  xxxd2303xxx  is
used as the intervention.55-65 numerous
phase iii trials have all failed to
demonstrate positive results for their
primary endpoints. further study of a
prophylactic strategy with vaginal progesterone in multiples without risk
stratiﬁcation is not warranted.
other populations with negative results from larger trials include symptomatic
cohorts
with
preterm
contractions or premature rupture of the
membranes.66,67 however, 2 metaanalyses that synthesized data from
smaller trials have suggested progestogens may be beneﬁcial in symptomatic populations with preterm
labor.68,69 additional larger trials are
necessary to better assess the efﬁcacy of
supplemental progesterone in women
with preterm labor; treatment is not

ajog.org
recommended in symptomatic populations until such studies are
performed.
a summary of clinical investigations
to date is presented in the box. three
important constructs regarding an indication for treatment are derived from the
present data: (1) deﬁning an indication
for treatment primarily based on a
biomarker in the ongoing pregnancy is
likely optimal to basing therapy solely on
obstetric history for the majority of patients, except for those at highest risk (a
previous mid-trimester spontaneous
preterm birth), (2) vaginal  xxxd3023xxx  appears superior to  xxxd2303xxx 
for efﬁcacy in asymptomatic patients
with a short cervix, and (3) women with
multiples pregnancy and symptomatic
patients do not respond to this therapeutic strategy like asymptomatic cohorts. the strength of recommendation
for the use of progestogens to prevent
preterm birth is based on the grading of
recommendations assessment, development, and evaluation guidelines
(box), and the present review is the ﬁrst
to assess this treatment strategy using
these suggested guidelines.70
prophylactic treatment may be
considered and offered to women with a
singleton pregnancy and who have a
history of preterm birth in the third
trimester, based on the single study by
meis et al38 while awaiting conﬁrmatory
phase iii data. additional trials of progestogens are needed to assess (1) the
comparable efﬁcacy between progestogens to validate the ﬁndings of
maher et al, (2) whether dosing should
be increased at differing gestational ages
such as the start of the third trimester to
improve efﬁcacy, and (3) safety.
are vaginal progesterone and 17ohpc equally safe?
therapeutics aimed to prevent preterm
birth such as tocolytics have limited efﬁcacy once symptoms develop, necessitating earlier interventions. current
indications for supplemental progestogens to prevent preterm birth
include populations that will most
probably deliver at term. consequently,
a high margin of safety is required
because these medications will be

administered to pregnant women who
are not experiencing potential beneﬁt
but who are undergoing a prolonged
exposure.
the fda review of  xxxd2303xxx  raised a ½t2
safety concern based on the data from
the trial by meis et al.71 the agency q4
performed a survival analysis that
generated kaplan-meier curves for the
control and intervention groups that
documented a cross-over event (figure). ½f1
the fda has required labeling that acknowledges an increase in miscarriage
that was observed with this treatment
from this trial. an early metaanalysis
supported safety concerns related to the
synthetic, as have more recent reviews,
especially in women with a multiple
gestations.72,73 in a secondary analysis
derived from patients who were enrolled
in the trial by meis et al,38 an
increased risk for preterm birth was
observed in subpopulations that were
discriminated by  xxxg1737xxx 
genotype. manuck et al26 demonstrated
that particular haplotype blocks
(rs503362jrs666553 and rs578029j
rs666553) were associated with an
adjusted odds ratio >10 for preterm
birth <32 weeks gestation with exposure
to  xxxd2303xxx  in the white/hispanic
subpopulation (adjusted odds ratio,
13.98 [95% ci, 1.27e153.32] and 16.19
[95% ci, 1.27e206.77], respectively).
differences were observed by race in this
study, and further pharmacogenomic
investigation of treatment response by
race is needed.
larger studies and metaanalyses have
documented harm with exposure to
progestogens, particularly in subpopulations at greater risk (table). a
trial level metaanalysis by sotiriadis
et al55 quantiﬁed a risk for harm related
to  xxxd2303xxx  exposure in multiple gestations (rr, 1.21; 95% ci, 1.03e1.43),
for a composite outcome of death and
severe morbidity. the number needed to
harm was 31 (95% ci 17e167). a
recently published participant-level
metaanalysis validated this concern for
increased adverse outcomes.56 this
study by schuit et al56 found women who
initiated  xxxd2303xxx  treatment at <24
weeks gestation had a higher rate of
adverse outcomes (82/518 (16%) vs

i. history indicated: prophylactic therapy in an asymptomatic, singleton pregnancy in women with a history of spontaneous preterm birth
indicated: prior mid trimester spontaneous preterm birth — superior agent:  xxxd3023xxx . studied agents included  xxxd2303xxx ,
which is an option.
reproducible evidence is observed. secondary analysis by spong et al of the trial by meis et al identified efficacy for this subpopulation.
validation for efficacy is provided from evidence for superiority of  xxxd3023xxx  compared with  xxxd2303xxx , maher et al (assumes 17ohpc exposure in this trial would not cause harm). therapy should be initiated at 15-20 weeks gestation. validation of  xxxd3023xxx 
being superior is needed by additional highly powered pragmatic trials. grade 1ba
considered: prior spontaneous preterm birth at 28-36 weeks gestation—studied agents: synthetic  xxxd2303xxx  and  xxxd3023xxx 
efficacy with  xxxd2303xxx  treatment is suggested from a single phase iii trial by meis et al, but remarkable heterogeneity is present in
metaanalysis (cochrane review). the largest trial testing vaginal progesterone did not demonstrate benefit in this population, but the
prevalence of a short cervix was relatively low in this study. objective data, particularly cervical length, likely serves to better guide therapy
in this subpopulation based on data from defranco et al (later). the superior progestogen optimizing both efficacy and safety in this
subpopulation has not been defined clearly. if treated, therapy should begin at 15-20 weeks gestation. additional dose-ranging and safety
studies are also needed. insufficient evidence from phase iii trials for strongest recommendation. grade 2b
ii. biomarker-based indication for therapy in a singleton pregnancy
a. short cervix: asymptomatic, mid trimester, 19-24 weeks gestation
1. universal screening strategy to identify a short cervix
indicated: cervical length 20 mm—superior agent:  xxxd3023xxx . studied agents included  xxxd2303xxx , which should not be
prescribed for this indication.
reproducible evidence for efficacy from phase iii trials, (hassan et al and fonseca et al). the superior agent is suggested because of
negative trials/secondary analysis by several groups. safety and efficacy in patients with the shortest of cervical lengths, <10 mm, may be
the subject for additional study to define optimal intervention, particularly if fetal membranes are exposed or intrauterine infection is
suspected. the efficacy of treatment at longer cervical lengths, such as 21-25 mm, also requires validation in much larger trials; however,
metaanalysis by romero et al has suggested potential benefit. grade 1a
2. select subpopulation: history of spontaneous preterm birth with a short cervix
considered: cervical length 30 mm—studied agent:  xxxd3023xxx 
based on evidence for pregnancy prolongation from a phase iii trial over the continuum of cervical length by defranco et al and a
participant-level metaanalysis by romero et al. the utilization of this criterion may be limited to those undergoing cervical surveillance. the
efficacy of treatment at cervical lengths >20 mm in this subpopulation requires validation in phase iii trials. insufficient evidence for
strongest recommendation. grade 2b
b. a short cervix with symptomatic preterm labor, premature rupture of membranes, or at later gestational ages
no indication at present and safety concerns exist from experimental and animal data. further investigation reserved for carefully monitored,
phase iii randomized trials. a single phase iii trial, martinez de tejada et al, demonstrated possible harm in women who are diagnosed with
preterm labor exposed to progesterone. grade 2b
c. biochemical biomarker or other sonographic finding as an indication or exclusion for therapy
no indication or exclusion for treatment based on objective biochemical findings or other evidence of a potentially altered physiology has been
identified and validated.
iii. multiple gestations
contraindicated in unselected populations:  xxxd2303xxx  should not be further investigated or prescribed in multiples because of identified safety
findings in an individual participant data metaanalysis by schuit et al. grade 1b
subpopulations with an objective biomarker for decidual/placental dysfunction have not been studied adequately with  xxxd3023xxx .
also, 2 individual participant level metaanalyses have suggested that a short cervix at <24 weeks gestation in asymptomatic patients may
provide an indication worthy of study. because of the presence of risk, treatment is not recommended until additional phase iii trials have been
performed in such candidate subpopulations that are stratified by biomarkers.
a

level of recommendation is based on data that were derived preferentially from phase iii trials with the application of the grading of recommendations assessment, development, and evaluation
criteria.

control subjects 60/512 (12%); rr, 1.4;
95% ci, 1.26e1.5). a signiﬁcant increase in composite adverse outcome
was also identiﬁed in the subpopulation
with a longer cervix, >25 mm, at
enrollment.
this
metaanalysis
concluded that  xxxd2303xxx  should not be
prescribed to women with a multiple

gestation. therefore, evidence for harm
should be incorporated into prescribing
decisions, and a mechanistic assessment
of safety concerns should direct further
research.
the safety of  xxxd2303xxx  exposure in
this population can also be evaluated by
application of the bradford hill criteria

to the body of evidence.74 one of these 9
criteria includes evaluation of dose
response. the duration of pregnancy in
multiples has been related signiﬁcantly
inversely to the serum  xxxd2303xxx  concentration, (hazard ratio, 1.14; p ¼
.001).19 a dose-response for adverse
outcomes in multiple gestations is also

suggested by comparison of trials that
tested  xxxd2303xxx . the largest trial to date
in multiples that evaluated prophylactic
 xxxd2303xxx  was performed by lim et al57
who used a dose of 250 mg/wk. these
investigators found a signiﬁcant increase
in severe respiratory distress with exposure to the synthetic (rr, 1.55; 95% ci,
1.01e2.37). a study by senat et al58 used
a dose of 500 mg twice weekly of 17ohpc in women with a twin gestation
and a short cervix. they unfortunately
observed a 2.4-fold increase in early
preterm birth at <32 weeks gestation in
the intent-to-treat analysis (24/82 (29%)
treated vs 10/79 (12%) control; p ¼
.007). a signiﬁcant increase in perinatal
mortality rate and a composite adverse
outcome of stillbirth plus respiratory
distress were observed.75
other phase iii trials in multiple gestations have suggested potential beneﬁt
rather than harm with exposure to progestogens. norman et al59 observed a
reduction in cesarean delivery and
operative vaginal delivery with progesterone use. rode et al60 demonstrated a
reduction in emergency cesarean delivery and a signiﬁcant reduction in
birthweight of <1500 g in their monochorionic subgroup. subpopulations at
greater risk for suspected decidual/
placental pathophysiologic conditions
may be appropriate for future study with
 xxxd3023xxx . of interest, the
only trial that did not identify harm with
exposure to  xxxd2303xxx  in a twin

ajog.org
gestation, the progestwin trial,
recently found a signiﬁcant increase in
birthweight, a decrease in frequency of
birthweight <1500 g, and a decrease in
composite neonatal morbidity with
treatment.76 the mean gestational age at
delivery for the placebo group was 34.6
 3.8 weeks gestation in this study,
which could indicate a higher risk proﬁle
of participants that deserves further
evaluation.
whether asymptomatic patients with
a multiple gestation and short cervix
(<24 weeks gestation) could beneﬁt
from supplemental progesterone has
been suggested by 2 participant-level
metaanalyses and a recently published
randomized trial.43,56,77 el-refaie et al77
randomly assigned 250 women with a
cervical length of 20-25 mm between 2024 weeks of gestation. the rates of respiratory distress syndrome, mechanical
ventilation and of early neonatal death
were reduced signiﬁcantly with treatment. however, a retrospective study by
brubaker et al78 suggested caution in this
population because of safety concerns.
given the safety proﬁle of progestogen
exposure in multiples, additional phase
iii trials are necessary, and any future
trial should assess treatment response
thoroughly by interrogating multiple
biomarkers.
structural teratogenicity has not been
observed with early exposure to progestogens.79,80 mechanisms for harm
related to exposure later in gestation will
likely involve alteration of progesterone
receptor activity. because these receptors
are located within the central nervous
system of the developing fetus, functional abnormalities such as behavioral
teratogenicity requires further investigation. basic science investigations have
raised plausible concerns for such
developmental abnormalities particularly for the synthetic drug.81,82 however, to date, no longer have term adverse
harms been identiﬁed after exposure to
either of these medications, but the data
are limited.60,83-85
based on present data that were
derived from phase iii trials and metaanalysis,  xxxd3023xxx  appears to
be the safer progestogen, but plausible
concerns for adverse outcomes remain.

safety for an intervention in any obstetric population is more probable
when natural agents are administered at
doses that yield exposures that are within
boundaries observed in human reproduction.86 robust dose-response studies q7
have yet to be performed and should be
designed carefully. also, this treatment
strategy undoubtedly will be applied to
other populations who are at risk for
adverse events, such as women with an
episode of preterm labor. animal data
have demonstrated the potential for
adverse events, which include death,
when supplemental progestogens are
administered in models for preterm labor.84 of concern, a recent trial in
symptomatic women with an episode of
preterm labor demonstrated that supplemental  xxxd3023xxx  was
associated with a signiﬁcant increase in
spontaneous preterm birth at <34 weeks q5
gestation (74/180 (40%) intervention
group vs 48/168 placebo (29%); rr, 1.4;
95% ci, 1.04e1.88; p ¼.03).67 hence, in q8
symptomatic women, biomarkers that
augment cervical assessment, particularly those that describe infectious/inﬂammatory pathways, may be essential
to help guide safer exploration of the
efﬁcacy of supplemental progestogens.

risk/benefit and cost of progestogen
use
vaginal progesterone indicated for a
sonographic short cervix is the ﬁrst drug
to demonstrate reproducible efﬁcacy for
the prevention of early preterm birth in
independent phase iii trials. the number of patients needed to screen to prevent 1 early preterm birth (<34 weeks q6
gestation) has been estimated as 125
(95% ci, 88e288), and the number
needed to screen to prevent a case of
major neonatal morbidity/death has
been quantiﬁed as 225 (95% ci,
150e1013; calculated for treatment of
women with a cervical length of 25
mm).49 the proposed indications in the
box for progestogen use mimic the
maturation of indication observed with
cervical cerclage by focusing more on
cervical length than obstetric history.88,89 despite the success of vaginal
progesterone and cerclage in women
with a short cervix, other treatments are

needed to further reduce the sequelae of
early preterm birth. a poor treatment
response to progestogen therapy has not
been deﬁned (eg, progressive marked
cervical shortening). adjuvant interventions that use biomechanical
strategies or medications that further
alter the inﬂammatory milieu deserve
evaluation in well-selected higher risk
groups, based on biomarkers that suggest a poor treatment response.90,91
intramuscular therapy with 17ohpc has the advantage to document
compliance that is important for treatment response.51 additional large pragmatic trials may better deﬁne the
comparative effectiveness of these drugs
that are used in clinical practice.
methods to enhance compliance with
vaginal treatment are needed. however,
the treatment response to  xxxd2303xxx  also
appears to vary, based on the gestational
age of the previous preterm birth,
whether a term birth has occurred,
maternal weight, and serum concentration.45,92-95 such a variable response
explains, in part, the substantial heterogeneity that was noted in the cochrane
review of progestogens to prevent
recurrent early preterm birth.96
results from the conﬁrmatory prolong trial are expected relatively soon.
this trial will enroll women at 16-20þ6
weeks gestation with a history of spontaneous preterm birth (20-36 weeks
gestation) and prophylactically expose
them to either weekly  xxxd2303xxx  (250
mg) or placebo. because of its estimated
sample size of approximately 1700 participants, this trial will be important in
deﬁning the direction for progestogen
treatment. a positive trial with evidence
of safety will validate the approach and
emphasize prophylaxis for women with a
history of preterm birth that occurred
over a wide gestational age range (20-36
weeks). the prolong trial may also
ﬁnd that beneﬁt is limited to a select
subpopulation such as those with a history of mid-trimester preterm birth.
however, a negative trial should not
negate the therapeutic beneﬁts that have
been identiﬁed with vaginal progesterone because these progestogens are
different drugs with differing pharmacodynamics. given the importance of

this trial, its results should be forwarded
to the obstetric community as early as
possible.
progestogen treatment indicated for a
short cervix is cost-effective.13,14,97,98 an
updated investigation by werner et al98
again
demonstrated
the
costeffectiveness of this treatment strategy.
further savings are possible by the
avoidance of treatment in women with a
history of third-trimester preterm birth
and who have the longest cervical
lengths.50 cost-beneﬁt has become more
germane because the compounding of
 xxxd2303xxx  is being curtailed by the
fda.99
although the fda has responsibility
for the marketing of products in the
united states, professional organizations
in obstetrics have a greater inﬂuence on
practice. most medications in obstetrics
that demonstrate efﬁcacy (eg, corticosteroids for fetal lung maturity, magnesium for neuroprotection, and others)
are not approved by the fda.1 practice
guidelines that address newer interventions, such as progestogen use,
should be reassessed frequently because
the development of therapeutics in obstetrics rarely proceeds along common
regulatory pathways, which increases
uncertainty. select basic principles for
the assessment of efﬁcacy are common
to the application of the grading of
recommendations assessment, development, and evaluation guidelines and
the evaluation of new drugs by the
fda.100 such evaluations temporarily
may inﬂuence the practice of obstetrics
differently; however, the inevitable direction for therapeutics in obstetrics is
toward a better appreciation of pathophysiologic condition, more selective
intervention, better targeting of pathophysiologic condition, and use of the
safest treatments. remarkably, the ﬁrst
intervention to demonstrate a signiﬁcant
reduction reproducibly in early preterm
birth in phase iii trials fulﬁlls these
important objectives. recent data that
evaluated the pharmacodynamics, safety,
and efﬁcacy of progestogens provides
important new information regarding
the optimal use or avoidance of these
medications that should alter current
recommendations.
