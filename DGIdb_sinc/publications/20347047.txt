the mechanisms leading to airway hyper-responsiveness (ahr) in asthma are still not fully understood.
ahr could be produced by hypersensitivity of the airway smooth muscle or hyperreactivity of the
airways. this study was conducted to ascertain whether ahr in a murine model of asthma is produced
by changes at the level of the airway smooth muscle. airway smooth muscle responses were characterised in vitro in isolated trachea spirals from naive mice and from an acute ovalbumin (ova) challenge
model of allergic asthma. ahr was investigated in vivo in conscious, freely moving mice. inﬂammatory
cell inﬂux into the lungs and antibody responses to the antigen were also measured. in vitro study of
tracheal airway smooth muscle from naïve mice demonstrated concentration-related contractions to
 xxxd2586xxx  and 5-ht, but no responses to histamine or adenosine or its stable analogue, 50 -n-ethylcarboxamidoadenosine. the contractions to 5-ht were inhibited by  xxxd2419xxx  and alosetron indicating
involvement of 5-ht2a and 5-ht3 receptors, respectively. in an acute model of allergic asthma, ovatreated mice were shown to be atopic by inﬂammatory cell inﬂux to the lungs after ova challenge,
increases in total ige and ova-speciﬁc igg levels and contractions to ova in isolated trachea. in the
asthmatic model, ahr to  xxxd2586xxx  was demonstrated in conscious, freely moving mice in vivo and in
isolated trachea in vitro 24 and 72 h after ova challenge. no ahr in vitro was seen for 5-ht, histamine or
adenosine. these results suggest that, in our mouse model of asthma, changes occur at the level of the
muscarinic receptor transduction pathway of coupling to airway smooth muscle contraction. these
changes are maintained when tissues are removed from the inﬂammatory environment and for at least 3
days.

1. introduction
allergic asthma is a chronic inﬂammatory disease of the airways
with superimposed acute exacerbations [1,2]. exposure to
concentrations of allergens that would be innocuous in a normal
individual provokes acute exacerbations of asthma characterised by
airway inﬂammation and airway hyper-responsiveness (ahr)
leading to airway bronchoconstriction [3,4]. despite numerous
studies examining the potential causes for the development of ahr
in asthma, the mechanisms underlying ahr are still largely
unknown. it is usually difﬁcult to determine whether ahr is due to
hypersensitivity of the airway smooth muscle (asm) resulting in
a decrease in the threshold sensitivity to spasmogens, or to

hyperreactivity of the airways leading to exaggerated closure of
asthmatic airways, or to a combination of both mechanisms [5]. it
has been suggested that airway inﬂammation may contribute to
ahr by altering the contractile properties of the asm as well as its
autonomic regulation [6]. however, it seems unlikely that the mere
presence of inﬂammatory cells and their mediators in the airways
would be the only cause of ahr. indeed, ahr can persist in asthmatic patients treated with anti-inﬂammatory drugs, even in the
absence of airway inﬂammation [7]. therefore, it is essential to
study the behaviour of the asm isolated from the inﬂammatory
environment to investigate whether ahr is due to alterations at the
level of the asm itself. indeed, the importance of understanding the
complex role of the asm in ahr in asthma has been deﬁned as
a critical issue by the national heart, lung and blood institute
workshop in september 2006 [8].
in the present study, changes in asm contractile properties were
investigated in an acute model of allergic asthma in mice. this
model has been previously characterised in our group and shows
close resemblance to human asthma, with the presence of airway
inﬂammation, ahr, early and late phase asthmatic responses and

increased levels of total ige and ova-speciﬁc igg [9]. in human
asthma, the stimuli used to measure ahr are differentiated into
direct and indirect. direct stimuli, such as histamine or  xxxd2586xxx  which act directly on receptors on the asm, reﬂect the
persistent component of ahr. in contrast, indirect physical or
chemical stimuli such as exercise or adenosine, which act via
release of mediators from inﬂammatory cells, reﬂect more closely
variable or episodic ahr [10]. in order to study changes in asm
contractility in mice, we needed to use a range of agonists that act
on the main receptors in the airways and, in particular, are likely
mediators of asthmatic bronchoconstriction. therefore, we investigated muscarinic, histamine, 5-ht and adenosine receptor
agonists in our murine model of allergic asthma. in a previous
study, increased responsiveness to acetylcholine was demonstrated
in isolated bronchial but not tracheal preparations of ovasensitised and challenged mice [11]. here we used tracheal preparations and show ahr to  xxxd2586xxx  in vitro as well as in vivo,
but did not see ahr to 5-ht, histamine or adenosine in vitro. our
results suggest that ahr in this model involves speciﬁc changes in
muscarinic receptor signal transduction pathways in the asm but
not a non-speciﬁc change in asm sensitivity.
2. materials and methods
2.1. acute ova sensitisation and challenge protocol
male balb/c mice (harlan ltd, bicester, uk) weighing 20e25 g
were maintained under conventional animal housing conditions
receiving food and drinking water ad libitum. all studies complied
with the guidelines for the care and use of laboratory animals
according to the animals (scientiﬁc procedures) act 1986. the
acute sensitisation and challenge protocols have been described
previously [9]. brieﬂy, mice were sensitised on days 0 and 5 by an i.
p. injection of 100 mg/mouse ovalbumin (ova) and 10% (50 mg/
mouse)  xxxd131xxx  in phosphate-buffered saline (pbs);
controls received  xxxd131xxx  alone. twelve to sixteen
days after the last injection, ova-sensitised (o/o) and control
 xxxd131xxx -sensitised (v/o) mice were challenged by
inhalation of a 0.5% ova aerosol in 0.9%  xxxd3213xxx  solution
(saline) twice on the same day, 4 h apart. ova-sensitised animals
were also challenged with the vehicle saline alone (o/v). naive
animals were untreated.
2.2. non-invasive determination of ahr
airway function was measured in unrestrained, conscious mice
by barometric plethysmography using a single chamber, wholebody plethysmography system (buxco research systems,
winchester, u.k.) [9]. enhanced pause (penh) [12] was used as
a measure of in vivo airway responsiveness to inhaled  xxxd2586xxx 
24 and 72 h after the ﬁrst ova or saline challenge. baseline penh
was measured by placing the animals singly in the chamber for
1 min before a 5 min exposure to 1, 10 or 30 mg/ml  xxxd2586xxx 
aerosol delivered into the chamber by an aerogen nebuliser (buxco
research systems). results were expressed as percentage change in
penh with respect to baseline (mean  standard error of the mean,
s.e.m.).
2.3. cellular inﬁltration
after introducing 3  1 ml saline into the lungs, bronchoalveolar
lavage (bal) ﬂuid was withdrawn from the lungs of naïve mice and
mice killed 24 or 72 h after the ﬁrst ova or saline challenge [9].
smears of bal cells were prepared for differential cell counting by
cytocentrifugation and differentially stained with 0.15% leishman’s

301

stain [9]. lymphocytes, macrophages, eosinophils and neutrophils
were counted in the bal ﬂuid samples under a light microscope.
results were expressed as a percentage of the total number of cells
counted, with a minimum of 200 cells counted on two different
slides per animal (mean  s.e.m.). a total cell count was not
possible because of the occasional presence of red blood cells in the
bal ﬂuid.
2.4. total ige and ova-speciﬁc igg
blood samples were collected from all animals before the lavage
[9]. total ige in serum samples was measured using a direct
sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (elisa) [9].
brieﬂy, microplates were coated overnight at 4  c with 10 mg/ml
goat anti-mouse ige and then incubated with diluted serum
samples followed by 1:1000 monoclonal rat anti-mouse ige
conjugated to horseradish peroxidase. after addition of the enzyme
substrate, orthophenylene diamine (opd), the absorbance at
490 nm was measured and the concentration of total ige in the
serum samples was calculated with reference to serial dilutions of
a standard mouse ige isotype control (mean  s.e.m.). ova-speciﬁc
igg antibodies in the serum samples were measured using an
indirect elisa [9]. brieﬂy, microplates were coated overnight at 4  c
with 10 mg/ml ova and then incubated with diluted serum samples
followed by 1:2000 goat anti-mouse igg conjugated to horseradish
peroxidase. after incubation with opd, the absorbance was determined at 450 nm and the concentration of ova-speciﬁc igg in the
serum samples was calculated with reference to serial dilutions of
a standard mouse igg antibody (mean  s.e.m.).
2.5. isolated trachea
the trachea was carefully dissected out, cut into a spiral and
suspended in krebs-bicarbonate solution (nacl 118 mm, nahco3
25 mm, kcl 4.7 mm, cacl2 2.5 mm,  xxxd2534xxx  1.18 mm, kh2po4
1.18 mm, d-glucose 11.65 mm) at 37  c and gassed with 5% co2 in
o2. the epithelium was not removed. changes in isometric tension
of the asm were measured using an isometric tension transducer
(uf1 sensitivity range 55 g, pioden controls ltd, canterbury, uk)
and were recorded on a mt8p polygraph (lectromed ltd, jersey,
uk). intrinsic tone was induced by equilibrating the spirals under
an applied tension of 0.5 g for 60 min with regular washes.
following the equilibration period, the responses of tracheal spirals
to the cumulative addition of increasing concentrations of  xxxd2586xxx , 5-ht, adenosine, 50 -n-ethyl-carboxamidoadenosine
(neca) or histamine were measured. to study any relaxant effects
of 5-ht, adenosine or neca, the drugs were added cumulatively to
tracheal spirals precontracted with a submaximal concentration of
 xxxd2586xxx  (300 nm). to investigate the 5-ht receptor subtypes
involved in the contractions induced by 5-ht, 35 nm  xxxd2419xxx  (5ht2a receptor antagonist) or 30 nm alosetron ( xxxg1116xxx 
antagonist) were added to the trachea 15 min before the cumulative addition of 5-ht. finally, sensitisation to ova was determined
in all tracheal preparations using a single dose of 5 mg/ml ova.
responses of the tracheal smooth muscle were measured as
changes in isometric tension (grams) and were expressed as
a percentage of the maximal response to  xxxd2586xxx  (mean  s.e.
m.), for which a cumulative concentrationeresponse curve was
obtained in all tissues at the outset. in addition, in some experiments contractions to  xxxd2586xxx  were expressed as
a percentage of the maximal response to 5-ht (mean  s.e.m.).
these methods of standardisation were used to overcome interexperiment variability due to variation in asm content between the
small tracheal spirals obtained from different mice. the mean
maximal contractile responses (emax  s.e.m.) and mean ec50

values (molar concentration for 50% of maximal response, when
plotted as a percentage of their own maximum response) were
calculated from individual curves for contractile agonists.
2.6. statistical analysis
an unpaired two-tailed student’s t-test was used to calculate
signiﬁcant differences (p < 0.05) between two groups, whereas
one-way anova followed by a bonferroni post-hoc test was used
for statistical comparisons between more than two groups.
2.7. materials
antibodies used for the total ige elisas were obtained from
southern biotech, (cambridge bioscience, birmingham, u.k.). goat
anti-mouse ige-hrp was supplied by pierce (perbio science,
northumberland, u.k.). standard mouse igg antibody, adenosine,
neca, histamine diphosphate,  xxxd2586xxx  chloride and 5-ht
creatinine sulphate were obtained from sigma (poole, u.k.). alosetron hydrochloride was a generous gift from glaxosmithkline
(stevenage, u.k.).  xxxd2419xxx  was purchased from tocris
(avonmouth, u.k.).  xxxd131xxx  (rectapurô) was
obtained from merck eurolab (briare le canal, france). ovalbumin
was supplied by  xxxg257xxx  (poole, u.k.). all other chemicals were
obtained from fisher chemicals (loughborough, u.k.) and were of
analar grade.
3. results
3.1. in vitro pharmacology in trachea from naïve mice
 xxxd2586xxx  and 5-ht induced concentration-dependent
contractions in tracheal smooth muscle from naive mice (fig. 1).
the maximal response for  xxxd2586xxx  was reached at 100 mm
producing a contraction of 0.08  0.01 grams of tension. the
maximal contractile effect for 5-ht (65.4  9.6%) was signiﬁcantly
smaller than the maximal response obtained for  xxxd2586xxx .
both the  xxxg1113xxx  antagonist,  xxxd2419xxx  (35 nm) and the
 xxxg1116xxx  antagonist, alosetron (30 nm) greatly reduced the

3.2. allergen-induced airway responses
a signiﬁcant time-dependent eosinophilia was seen in o/o mice
compared to naïve mice 24 and 72 h after ova challenge which was
accompanied by a signiﬁcant decrease in the percentage of
macrophages at 72 h. in addition, the percentage of neutrophils in
o/o mice was signiﬁcantly increased after 24 h compared to naïve
animals (fig. 2). levels of cellular inﬁltration were also measured in
control o/v and v/o mice at 24 h and 72 h after challenge and were
not signiﬁcantly different from naive mice (data not shown). the
serum levels of total ige and ova-speciﬁc igg in o/o mice were
signiﬁcantly increased 24 h and 72 h after ova challenge compared
to naïve animals and compared to v/o mice at all time points except
72 h for total ige (fig. 3). ova-speciﬁc igg levels were also significantly increased in control o/v mice compared to naïve and v/o
mice 24 h and 72 h after challenge (fig. 3). no response was seen
after in vitro exposure of tracheal spirals from naïve and v/o mice to
the allergen ova (5 mg/ml) (fig. 4). however, a contraction was seen
to a single dose of 5 mg/ml ova in tracheal smooth muscle from
ova-sensitised mice (o/o and o/v) with the response in o/v mice
being signiﬁcantly greater than that seen in o/o mice 72 h after
challenge (fig. 4).
3.3. in vivo reactivity to inhaled  xxxd2586xxx 
small, signiﬁcant bronchoconstrictor responses were seen to
1 mg/ml  xxxd2586xxx  in all groups except for o/o mice after 24 h
and 72 h and o/v mice after 72 h (fig. 5). all groups exhibited
signiﬁcant bronchoconstriction to 10 and 30 mg/ml 24 h and 72 h
after challenge (fig. 5). however, in ova-sensitised and challenged
mice (o/o) a much larger concentration-dependent bronchoconstriction was seen after exposure to  xxxd2586xxx . 10 mg/ml  xxxd2586xxx  had no signiﬁcantly greater effect in o/o mice 24 h after
ova challenge compared to naive and control o/v mice, but
produced signiﬁcantly more bronchoconstriction in o/o mice 72 h
after challenge (fig. 5). 30 mg/ml  xxxd2586xxx  induced signiﬁcantly
more bronchoconstriction in o/o mice 24 and 72 h after challenge
compared to naive and control o/v mice (fig. 5).

tracheal spirals precontracted with  xxxd2586xxx  (data not shown).
no contractions or relaxations to histamine, adenosine or neca
were seen in non-precontracted or precontracted tracheal smooth

tracheal spirals from naïve, control o/v and v/o and ovasensitised and challenged (o/o) mice showed concentrationdependent contractile responses after cumulative addition of

response) in o/o mice 24 h and 72 h after ova challenge were
signiﬁcantly greater than those in naïve mice (fig. 6, table 1). the

concentration-dependent contractile responses to 5-ht were
similar in o/v, v/o and naïve groups, with no signiﬁcant differences in the maximal responses to 5-ht (expressed as
a percentage of the  xxxd2586xxx  response). there were small
signiﬁcant reductions in the maximum 5-ht responses in the o/o

4. discussion
in experimental mouse models both systemic sensitisation and
airway challenge with an allergen are necessary to induce ahr
similar to that observed in asthmatic patients. ahr has previously

a

been demonstrated in vivo in murine models of asthma [12e16].
however, few studies have investigated ahr in vitro to ascertain
whether it is due to changes in receptors at the level of the asm
[11]. in our study, tracheal spirals were used in vitro to identify any
hyper-responsiveness of 5-ht, muscarinic, histamine or adenosine
receptors which could contribute to ahr in ova-sensitised and
challenged mice. most previous studies have employed tracheal
preparations to investigate the pharmacology of the receptors

present in the trachea of naïve mice or actively sensitised animals
receiving no challenge [17e21].

4.1. pharmacology of naïve asm
to understand the factors that inﬂuence asm tone and function
to induce ahr in asthma, it was ﬁrst necessary to investigate the
pharmacology of the asm in naïve mice before extending the study
to a mouse model of asthma. the results demonstrated the presence of functional muscarinic and 5-ht receptors in the asm of
naïve mice in vitro similarly to previous studies in trachea with
 xxxd2586xxx  [20] and 5-ht [20,22].
histamine [23] and adenosine [14] are also important bronchoconstrictor or inﬂammatory mediators implicated in the pathogenesis of human asthma. however, no asm responses to
histamine were seen in trachea from naïve mice suggesting an
absence of histamine receptors in murine asm. in addition, murine
tracheal asm failed to show any contraction to adenosine. as the
usual response to adenosine analogues of isolated trachea from
naïve guinea-pigs is bronchodilation [24], relaxant effects of
adenosine were investigated in trachea precontracted with  xxxd2586xxx . however, no contractions or relaxations to adenosine or
its metabolically stable analogue, neca, were seen. the latter
ﬁnding suggests that the absence of a response to adenosine was
not due to the rapid metabolism of adenosine. the apparent lack of
histamine and adenosine receptors in murine tracheal asm agrees
with previous studies in murine trachea where no responses were
seen to histamine [19] or adenosine [25].
our results suggest that the contractile effects of 5-ht on
murine airways involve both 5-ht2a and  xxxg1116xxx  subtypes.
the 5-ht2a antagonist,  xxxd2419xxx , greatly reduced the contractile
response to 5-ht, in agreement with the results of moffatt et al.
[20] in murine tracheas. the  xxxg1116xxx  antagonist, alosetron,
also greatly reduced the contractile response to 5-ht in naïve
murine asm. the muscarinic antagonist, atropine, has also been
shown to reduce the maximum of the 5-ht concentrationeresponse curve in murine trachea [20]. these ﬁndings
combined with our data suggest that 5-ht activates 5-ht3
receptors on parasympathetic acetylcholine-containing neurones
resulting in the release of acetylcholine which then activates m3
receptors on the asm [26]. 5-ht may also indirectly contract
murine asm by activating  xxxg1113xxx -dependent release of
acetylcholine from the epithelium [20]. overall, our data show
that both 5-ht2a and 5-ht3 receptors are involved in the response
to 5-ht in mouse asm. interestingly, the involvement of both

once we had established the receptor pharmacology of our
murine tracheal smooth muscle in naive mice and shown that it
was consistent with the ﬁndings of others [19,20,22,25], we
investigated whether ahr could be demonstrated in our murine
model of asthma. we have previously described a model of acute
allergic asthma in mice showing the major features of the disease
[9]. here we characterised our model further and conﬁrmed that
sensitising animals with the allergen ova triggers an asthma-like
ige-mediated type i hypersensitivity response, producing an atopic
status. airway inﬂammation was demonstrated by the signiﬁcant
increase in eosinophils in bal ﬂuid samples and elevated plasma
levels of total ige and ovalbumin-speciﬁc igg in ova-sensitised and
challenged mice (o/o). levels of inﬂammatory cells in the lungs and
antibodies in the serum were increased 24 and 72 h after challenge.
eosinophil levels were signiﬁcantly higher after 72 h compared to
24 h. elevated levels of ova-speciﬁc igg antibodies in ova-sensitised saline-challenged animals (o/v) indicated the effectiveness of
the initial sensitisation. levels of total ige in serum samples from o/
v groups were also higher than naïve levels, although this was not
signiﬁcant. this is probably due to the elisa measuring total ige
rather than ova-speciﬁc ige; the non-speciﬁc ige would not
change, but would dilute the changes in ova-speciﬁc ige. also, the
asm from all ova-sensitised mice showed signiﬁcant contractile
responses after addition of ova in vitro. as expected, tracheas from
non-sensitised naïve and v/o animals did not respond to ova.
contractile responses to ova in vitro were higher in tracheal
smooth muscle from o/v animals compared to o/o mice and this
was signiﬁcant at 72 h. it is likely that the in vivo ova challenge
produces a partial degranulation of mast cells in the o/o group thus
reducing the subsequent in vitro response to ova.
4.3. ahr in vivo and in vitro
bronchoconstrictor responses of o/o mice to  xxxd2586xxx 
were demonstrated both in vivo and in vitro in our acute model of
allergic asthma. using a whole-body plethysmograph, signiﬁcant
concentration-dependent increases in penh after  xxxd2586xxx 
inhalation were seen in conscious, unrestrained naïve and o/v
mice. however, the responses to the higher doses of  xxxd2586xxx 
in the o/o mice were signiﬁcantly greater indicating that these
animals displayed a signiﬁcant degree of ahr. penh values were
measured as an index of airway resistance. this parameter has been
extensively used in the literature as an indicator of ahr [9,28e30].
however, the validity of penh as a measure of airways mechanics
has been severely criticised recently [31,32]. it has been recommended that results with unrestrained conscious animals are
corroborated with invasive measures in anaesthetized animals by
use of mechanical ventilation and the forced oscillation technique
[33]. it is, however, conceded that the anaesthetic and mechanical
ventilation may distort the effects seen in conscious animals by
interference with the animal’s natural breathing behaviour [33].
lomask [34] has described how penh derived from ﬂow wholebody plethysmography waveforms represents resistance and that
chambers that utilize a pneumotachograph, as employed in this
study, are acceptable. we therefore conclude that the changes in
penh represent bronchoconstriction and that we have demonstrated in vivo ahr to  xxxd2586xxx .
ahr to  xxxd2586xxx  was also shown in vitro in isolated tracheal
spirals from o/o mice. here, the increase in the magnitude of the
response but not the potency (ec50) of  xxxd2586xxx , suggests that

306

s. fernandez-rodriguez et al. / pulmonary pharmacology & therapeutics 23 (2010) 300e307

hyper-responsiveness rather than hypersensitivity is occurring. in
contrast to the ahr widely demonstrated in vivo, contradictory
results have been obtained in vitro with tissues from asthmatic
patients. some studies reported increased contractile responses of
tissues obtained post-mortem or surgically, whereas others
showed normal contractile function or even constrictor hyporresponsiveness [35]. thus, in some studies asm from asthmatic
subjects gave larger contractions to  xxxd2586xxx , histamine and
adenosine compared to tissue from non-asthmatics [36,37].
however, other studies obtained similar contractions to  xxxd2586xxx  and histamine in tissues from asthmatic and healthy
patients [37,38].
the validity of isometric force measurements, as opposed to
isotonic force measurements, as an index of airway bronchoconstriction has been questioned in the literature [7,39,40]. however,
in this paper we have demonstrated its validity as the ahr to
 xxxd2586xxx  we had seen in vivo in o/o mice was also obtained in
vitro. its use is also supported by the literature as isometric
measurements have been described previously as a very sensitive
technique for measuring airway responses [41]. de jonsgte et al.
[36] reported lower sensitivity to  xxxd2586xxx  in human small
airways when contractions were measured isotonically rather than
isometrically. we used tracheal smooth muscle for this study as,
although the tracheal musculature has a close anatomical and
physiological association with the bronchial musculature, it
produces larger contractile responses than bronchial spirals
[19,42].
in contrast to the in vitro ahr to  xxxd2586xxx , we did not see
any signiﬁcant ahr in vitro to 5-ht, histamine or adenosine in o/o
mice at any time point after challenge. the small reduction in
responses to 5-ht in o/o mice was probably because the responses
were expressed as a percentage of the increased  xxxd2586xxx 
responses. adenosine also failed to produce a contractile response
in trachea from o/v mice, i.e. sensitised but not ova-challenged.
this was surprising since sensitised and naive mice [15,43], sensitised guinea-pigs [44] and asthmatic patients [45] produce
bronchoconstriction to neca and adenosine in vivo. passive or
active sensitisation therefore favours a bronchoconstrictor
response to adenosine in isolated trachea from guinea-pigs [46]
but not mice. although, in vivo ahr to these agonists was not
investigated here, 5-ht and histamine have been demonstrated
previously to display ahr in murine models of asthma in vivo
[14,47] and in asthmatic patients [48,49]. in addition, both 5-ht2a
and 5-ht3 receptors have been shown to be involved in pulmonary
function in man [27]. therefore, our results suggest that in vivo
ahr in our murine model of allergic asthma does not involve
changes in 5-ht receptors or adenosine and histamine receptors, if
present, in the asm. instead, in vivo ahr appears to involve
changes in muscarinic receptor-mediated contractions, since ahr
to  xxxd2586xxx  was seen both in vivo and in vitro 24 and 72 h after
ova challenge in our model. in vitro ahr is unlikely to be a nonspeciﬁc phenomenon at the level of the smooth muscle contractile
process since no ahr was seen for 5-ht. an increase in the
expression level of muscarinic receptors is unlikely as chiba et al.
failed to show an increase in mrna levels for m2 and m3 receptors
[11]. it would appear that the increased responsiveness is located
at the downstream transduction mechanisms involved in coupling
to the contractile machinery, possible at the  xxxg1027xxx 
(gq), since increased expression of g proteins has been demonstrated in murine models of ahr [50]. our ﬁnding, however, shows
that in vivo ahr after ova challenge is associated with persistent
increases in muscarinic receptor sensitivity when the tissue is
isolated from the inﬂammatory environment. elucidation of the
mechanisms underlying ahr in asthma is essential for the development of new therapies to treat asthma.
