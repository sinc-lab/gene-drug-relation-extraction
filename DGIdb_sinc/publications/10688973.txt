abstract
nociceptin žorphanin fq. is the recently discovered peptide agonist for the orphan receptor opioid receptor-like 1 žorl1.. despite the
high sequence homology between  xxxg1634xxx  and the opioid receptors, most opioids lack affinity for the  xxxg1634xxx . the affinity and
functional profile of opioids possessing activity at the  xxxg1634xxx  was determined using w3 hxnociceptin and nociceptin-stimulated
w35sxgtpgs binding. the m-opioid receptor-selective agonist lofentanil potently and competitively displaced w3 hxnociceptin at rat brain
receptors žic 50 62 nm.. lofentanil exhibited full agonism for enhancement of w35sxgtpgs binding to human recombinant  xxxg1634xxx 
receptors žec 50 50 nm.. the related piperidines ohmefentanyl and sufentanil and the nonselective opioid receptor agonist  xxxd2070xxx  were
less potent  xxxg1634xxx  agonists. the k 1 q k 3-opioid receptor agonistrm-opioid receptor antagonist naloxone benzoylhydrazone
was a pure antagonist at both rat brain and human  xxxg1634xxx  receptors. the nonselective opioid receptor partial agonist buprenorphine and the
nonselective opioid receptor antagonist žy.-quadazocine exhibited pure antagonism at rat brain receptors, but displayed partial agonism
at human  xxxg1634xxx  receptors. thus, opioids displaying full agonism at the  xxxg1634xxx  are also opioid receptor agonists, whereas
opioids that are antagonists or partial agonists at the  xxxg1634xxx  show antagonism or partial agonism at opioid receptors. in
addition, the stereospecificity required at opioid receptors appears to be retained at the  xxxg1634xxx , since žq.-quadazocine is
inactive at both receptors. these findings illustrate the structural and functional homology of the opioid recognition site on these two
receptor classes and suggest that opioids may provide leads for the design of nonpeptide  xxxg1634xxx  agonists and antagonists
lacking affinity for the classical opioid receptors. q 2000 elsevier science b.v. all rights reserved.

1. introduction
following the cloning of the d-opioid receptor ževans
et al., 1992; kieffer et al., 1992., homology screening of
brain cdna libraries resulted in the cloning of other
members of the opioid receptor family. in addition, a clone
termed orphan receptor-like 1 žorl1. having ; 50%
overall sequence homology with the opioid receptors was
identified and given orphan receptor status since it was not
activated by any known opioid peptide žmollereau et al.,
1994.. subsequently, a 17 amino acid peptide, named
nociceptin žmeunier et al., 1995. or orphanin fq žrein)

scheid et al., 1995., was discovered and found to be a
selective agonist for this receptor. despite the structural
similarities of both  xxxg1634xxx  with the opioid receptors and
nociceptin with opioid peptides žparticularly dynorphin.,
nociceptin and its receptor constitute a novel neurotransmitter system distinct from the opioid receptor systems
žfor review, see henderson and mcknight, 1997; meunier,
1997; darland et al., 1998..
nociceptin has been shown to regulate a number of
behavioral and physiological processes. although effects
on pain systems are somewhat controversial, i.c.v. nociceptin appears to oppose opioid-mediated analgesia and
has been argued to be part of an anti-opioid system in the
brain žtian et al., 1997.. in contrast, i.t. nociceptin is
generally analgesic žtian et al., 1997.. nociceptin has also
been shown to have anxiolytic-like activity žjenck et al.,

clarification of the pharmacology of the nociceptin
system would be aided by the discovery of selective
bioavailable agonists and antagonists. recently, the discovery of the first selective  xxxg1634xxx  receptor antagonist has
been reported žkawamoto et al., 1999.. prior to this report,
opioids provided the only known templates for small
molecule ligands. although most opioids are inactive, a
few do possess affinity for the  xxxg1634xxx . the
current study examines the structural requirements of opioids retaining affinity for the  xxxg1634xxx  and
characterizes their functional activity in relation to their
known opioid receptor profiles.

2.5. data analysis
for saturation experiments, nonlinear curve fitting of
the specific binding as a function of free radioligand
concentration was done using the hyperbolic function in
prism 2.0 žgraphpad, san diego, ca.. in no case did a
two-site hyperbolic function fit the data significantly better
than a one-site hyperbolic function by f-test žprism.. the
one-site hyperbolic fit was transformed into scatchard
format and plotted with the transformed data. in all cases,
dissociation constant ž k d . and receptor density ž bmax .
values were obtained from one-site hyperbolic fits and
means" s.e.m. values were calculated from the individual experiments. for concentration–effect curves, the concentration of test compound producing 50% inhibition
žic 50 . or enhancement žec 50 . of specific binding, and the
maximal extent of inhibition ž imax . or enhancement ž emax .
were determined for the individual experiments using the
sigmoidal equation in prism.

other opioids displayed lower potency žic 50 ; 0.5–4 mm..
the potencies of these opioids were very similar at rat
brain and human  xxxg1634xxx  nociceptin receptors. lofentanil

little change in bmax žfig. 1b. consistent with competitive
displacement.

optimal conditions to obtain a high nociceptin enhancement of w35 sxgtpgs binding relative to the basal level
were evaluated at rat brain receptors. a concentration of
100 mm nacl provided the optimal ratio of nociceptinstimulated to basal binding. optimal nociceptin stimulation
occurred between 1 and 3 mm mgcl 2 . nociceptin-stimulated w35 sxgtpgs binding was detected at gdp concentrations ); 1 mm and increased up to the highest gdp

lofentanil was the most potent stimulator of

stimulation of w35 sxgtpgs binding was  xxxd2070xxx  g
lofentanil; ohmefentanyl) sufentanil. in addition, lofentanil, ohmefentanyl, and  xxxd2070xxx  increased w35 sxgtpgs
binding above that produced by a submaximal concentration of nociceptin ž100 nm. žfig. 3b.. in contrast, sufentanil produced little increase, if any, in w35 sxgtpgs binding beyond that elicited by 100 nm nociceptin. these
opioids were not evaluated as stimulators of w35 sxgtpgs
binding at rat brain receptors because their activity at the
 xxxg1634xxx  was difficult to distinguish from their
activity at opioid receptors in this tissue.

ceptin receptor. the present study characterizes the few
opioids that do possess activity at the  xxxg1634xxx .
saturation analysis indicates that w3 hxnociceptin interacts with a single population of nociceptin receptors present in rat brain membranes with very high affinity ž k d
1.75 pm., a value similar to that reported at human  xxxg1634xxx 
using w125 ixwtyr14xnociceptin žfawzi et al., 1997.. both
one- and two-component saturation analyses with a wide
range of k d values ž2 pm–5 nm. have been reported
using brain membranes or recombinant receptors ždooley
and houghten, 1996; adapa and toll, 1997; ardati et al.,
1997; butour et al., 1997; fawzi et al., 1997.. many of the
reported differences may be due to high bound:free ratios.
in the current study, saturation analyses were performed in
a large incubation volume ž15 ml. to obtain bound:free
ratios of ;f 1 for all concentrations of w3 hxnociceptin
used.
the structures of opioids active at the  xxxg1634xxx  are shown in fig. 4. the most potent inhibitor of
w3 hxnociceptin binding is the phenylpiperidine lofentanil
žic 50 ; 50 nm., confirming an earlier report žbutour et al.,
1997.. the related fentanyl analogs ohmefentanyl and
sufentanil also possess affinity for the  xxxg1634xxx .
fentanyl itself is inactive žbutour et al., 1997.. disubstitution at the 4-position of the piperidine ring and phenethyl
substitution of the piperidine nitrogen as in lofentanil
confer the highest known affinity of any opioid for the
 xxxg1634xxx . in the morphinan series, key features
for activity at the  xxxg1634xxx  appear to be bulky

oxygen-containing substituents extending from the 6- or
7-position of the c-ring, as in buprenorphine, naloxone
benzoylhydrazone, and  xxxd2070xxx . this structure–activity
relationship žsar. is consistent with the recently reported
activity of the 6-substituted morphinan trk-820 at  xxxg1634xxx 
žseki et al., 1999.. similarly, bulky oxygen-containing
substituents extending from the 11-position of the 6,7-benzomorphan nucleus confers affinity for the  xxxg1634xxx , as in žy.-quadazocine and zenazocine. interestingly, the stereospecificity required at opioid receptors
appears to be retained at the  xxxg1634xxx , since
žq.-quadazocine is inactive at both the opioid žwood et
al., 1984. and nociceptin receptors. lofentanil and
buprenorphine increased the apparent k d of w3 hxnociceptin with little change in bmax , consistent with competitive
displacement.
the pharmacological profile of the opioids possessing
affinity for the  xxxg1634xxx  was determined by
w35 sxgtpgs binding. naloxone benzoylhydrazone did not
affect basal binding, but completely inhibited nociceptinstimulated w35 sxgtpgs binding at both rat brain and human  xxxg1634xxx  receptors indicating that it is a pure nociceptin
receptor antagonist. this finding is consistent with competitive antagonism observed in the rat vas deferens ždunnill
et al., 1996., but contrasts with the agonist-like effect of
naloxone benzoylhydrazone reported in a camp assay in
cells expressing  xxxg1634xxx , the mouse homologue of human

 xxxg1634xxx  žpan et al., 1996.. buprenorphine and žy.quadazocine acted as pure antagonists at rat brain receptors. žy.-quadazocine has been reported to be a  xxxg1634xxx  antagonist in the rat vas deferens žnicholson et al., 1996.. however, at the human  xxxg1634xxx  receptor,
buprenorphine and žy.-quadazocine stimulated basal binding and inhibited nociceptin-stimulated w35 sxgtpgs binding so that the stimulatory and inhibitory curves met at
about the same level, indicative of partial agonism in this
system. agonism by buprenorphine has recently been
demonstrated at  xxxg1634xxx  using a reporter gene assay žwnendt
et al., 1999.. zenazocine was also a pure antagonist at
brain receptors and appeared to be a partial agonist at
human  xxxg1634xxx . human  xxxg1634xxx  receptors expressed in hek
cells may be more sensitive in detecting partial agonism as
compared to nociceptin receptors in brain membranes because a higher receptor to g-protein ratio may exist in
these recombinant cells. these differences in efficacy at
native and cloned nociceptin receptors have also been
observed with the peptide ligand acetyl-ryyrik-nh 2 ,
which is an antagonist at native nociceptin receptors and
an agonist at  xxxg1634xxx  žberger et al., 1999..
lofentanil, ohmefentanyl, sufentanil, and  xxxd2070xxx 
stimulated w35 sxgtpgs binding at human  xxxg1634xxx  receptors
indicating that they are  xxxg1634xxx  agonists.
lofentanil, ohmefentanyl, and  xxxd2070xxx  further increased
the stimulation of w35 sxgtpgs binding induced by a submaximal concentration of nociceptin. the enhancement
curves in the presence and absence of nociceptin met at
about the same level indicating that the agonistic effect of
these opioids was mediated by the human  xxxg1634xxx  receptor
and that they are full agonists, as shown previously for
lofentanil and  xxxd2070xxx  as inhibitors of camp production
žbutour et al., 1997.. sufentanil did not increase the
stimulation of w35 sxgtpgs binding induced by nociceptin
suggesting that it has less than full efficacy at the human
 xxxg1634xxx  receptor.
in general, opioids that are agonists at the nociceptin
receptor display only agonistic activity at opioid receptors,
whereas opioids that are antagonists or partial agonists at
the  xxxg1634xxx  show antagonism or partial agonism at opioid receptors. thus, the m-opioid receptorselective agonists lofentanil žmaguire et al., 1992., ohmefentanyl, and sufentanil žgoldstein and naidu, 1989. as
well as the nonselective opioid receptor agonist  xxxd2070xxx 
žniwa et al., 1995. are all agonists at the nociceptin
receptor. in contrast, the nonselective partial opioid receptor agonists buprenorphine žkajiwara et al., 1986. and
zenazocine žward et al., 1985., the nonselective opioid
receptor antagonists žy.-quadazocine žwood et al., 1984.,
and the k 1 q k 3-opioid receptor agonistrm-opioid receptor
antagonist naloxone benzoylhydrazone žberzetei-gurske et
al., 1995. are antagonists or partial agonists at the  xxxg1634xxx . considering the similarity between nociceptin and dynorphin and also the possible connection
between  xxxg1634xxx  and the k-opioid receptor žpan et al.,

j.e. hawkinson et al.r european journal of pharmacology 389 (2000) 107–114

1996., it might be predicted that opioids selective for
k-opioid receptors would have a higher probability of
binding to the  xxxg1634xxx . however, opioid receptor selectivity appears to have little to do with activity at
the  xxxg1634xxx .
the similar actions of the opioids at the nociceptin
receptor and at the opioid receptors indicate that there is
structural and functional homology between the agonist
binding sites on these two receptor classes. this conclusion is supported by the synthesis of a universal peptide
agonist activating both nociceptin and k-opioid receptors
žreinscheid et al., 1998.. in addition, activation of the
 xxxg1634xxx  and opioid receptors have similar functional effects, including inhibition of camp production
žmeunier et al., 1995; reinscheid et al., 1995., inhibition
of calcium channels žknoflach et al., 1996., activation of
potassium channels žconnor et al., 1996., and activation of
mitogen-activated protein kinase žfawzi et al., 1997.. further support for this conclusion comes from site-directed
mutagenesis studies in which key residues of  xxxg1634xxx  are
replaced with the corresponding opioid receptor residues.
opioids display greatly increased affinities at these mutant
nociceptin receptors and have similar stereospecificity and
agonistrantagonist profiles as at opioid receptors žmeng et
al., 1998..
in conclusion, certain morphinan, 6,7-benzomorphan,
and piperidine opioids possess affinity for the nociceptin
receptor. opioid affinity for the  xxxg1634xxx  appears to be unrelated to opioid receptor selectivity, but
rather is related to an agonist binding site on the nociceptin
receptor displaying a unique sar such that only a few
available opioids have affinity. the mode of interaction of
opioids with the  xxxg1634xxx  is probably similar to
that at opioid receptors since opioids displaying agonism at
the  xxxg1634xxx  are also agonists at opioid receptors. similarly, opioids that are antagonists or partial agonists at the  xxxg1634xxx  exhibit antagonism or
partial agonism at opioid receptors. these opioid ligands
may provide leads for the design of nonpeptide agonists
and antagonists selective for the  xxxg1634xxx  relative to opioid receptors.
