serms act as er agonists in bone despite their antagonistic properties in other tissues. as well as inhibiting
bone remodelling, this effect may involve stimulation of osteoblast activity, in light of evidence from recent
in vivo studies. however, progress in exploring this action has been hampered by a lack of accurate in vitro
models. for example, er antagonists are reported to stimulate reporter assays based on estrogen target genes
in osteoblasts, contrary to their inhibitory effects in vivo. we examined whether evaluating global aspects of
er function provides a more accurate reﬂection of er activation in osteoblasts, based on the use of
morphological and/or transcriptional read-outs with green ﬂuorescent protein (gfp)-receptor chimeras.
osteoblast-like (ros and u2os) and breast cancer (mcf7) cells were transfected with a human  xxxg730xxx –gfp
fusion protein, and treated with er agonists (17beta-estradiol, and  xxxd1878xxx ), antagonists ( xxxd2165xxx  and zk
164015) and serms (tamoxifen, raloxifene, 4- xxxd91xxx  (4-ht) and hexestrol). we investigated
cellular compartmentalisation of these constructs by ﬂuorescence microscopy, nuclear mobility by
ﬂuorescence recovery after photobleaching (frap), and global activation of estrogenic transcription using
a ere-luc reporter. serms caused a modest increase in ere-luc activity in osteoblast-like cells (but not in
breast cells), and a reduction in nuclear mobility in breast (but not osteoblast-like) cells. these studies were
then repeated using a gfp chimera where the human gr ligand binding domain (lbd) was replaced by the
human  xxxg730xxx  lbd (ergr–gfp), combined with a gre-luc reporter. interestingly, serms increased both
cytoplasmic to nuclear translocation of ergr–gfp, and gre-luc reporter activity, in osteoblast-like (but not
breast) cells. indeed, transcriptional responses to serms in osteoblast-like cells were considerably greater
with the ergr/gre-luc than the  xxxg730xxx /ere-luc system, 4-ht inducing 300 and 25% increases in reporter
activity respectively. er antagonists were entirely without effect. we conclude that evaluation of global
estrogenic activity, as opposed to activation of a speciﬁc target gene, provides a more accurate read-out for
osteoblast stimulation. in particular, ergr-mediated gre-luc activity provides a high signal response to
estrogen agonists and serms, in a cell context dependent manner closely resembling that observed in vivo.
further studies utilising this system are justiﬁed to explore the mechanistic basis for estrogenic stimulation
of osteoblast activity, and to identify newer serms capable of targeting this activity.

introduction
as well as suppression of osteoclastic bone resorption, in vitro and in
vivo studies suggest beneﬁcial effects of serms on bone involve
stimulation of osteoblastic bone formation [1–3]. although clinical
evidence for a positive effect of serms on bone formation is currently
lacking, such a mode of action seems likely given that several clinical
studies suggest that estrogen directly stimulates osteoblast activity in
humans [4]. to provide a basis for exploring the mechanism of action of
serm-dependent stimulation in osteoblasts, and for screening newer
more effective compounds, we previously examined whether reporters

based on osteoblast-regulatory genes such as bone morphogenetic
protein (bmp)-6 can be used to evaluate preferential responses to serms
in osteoblasts. we found that serms, but not 17beta-estradiol (e2),
stimulated bmp-6 reporter activity in ros (osteosarcoma) cells
transiently transfected with  xxxg730xxx , whereas no stimulation was observed
in mcf7 (breast cancer) cells [5]. similar ﬁndings have been reported for
other putative osteoblast target genes such as  xxxd2991xxx ,  xxxd2108xxx  and cbfa1
[5–8]. however, the physiological relevance of these reporters can be
brought into question, as they also appear to be activated by antiestrogens such as  xxxd2165xxx  [5–8], which we previously found
produces a pronounced inhibitory effect on bone formation in vivo [9].
it has been suggested that binding of serms to ers induces (or
stabilises) receptor conformations that differ from those induced by
native ligands such as e2, facilitating interactions with different co-

b.s. maru et al. / bone 44 (2009) 102–112

regulatory proteins [10]. hence, variation between cells in the relative
expression of different steroid co-activators and co-repressors may
contribute to the cell context-dependent activity of serms [11]. this
hypothesis implies that in cells such as osteoblasts where serms act as
er agonists, this activity proﬁle applies to all er target genes, rather
than a speciﬁc subset. therefore, a global read-out of er activation
may prove more accurate in analysing serm-dependent activation of
osteoblasts, as compared with reporter assays based on speciﬁc target
genes. for example, our study described above suggests that tissue
differences in cellular compartmentalisation may also contribute to
the tissue selectivity of serm action in osteoblasts, since an  xxxg730xxx –gfp
chimeric receptor appeared to be expressed at higher levels in the
cytoplasm of un-stimulated ros compared with mcf7 cells [5].
alternatively, serm-dependent osteoblast stimulation may involve
effects on  xxxg730xxx  nuclear mobility. for example, both e2 and tamoxifen
were found to re-distribute a  xxxg730xxx –gfp chimeric protein within the
nucleus of hela cells, leading to a more punctate distribution, and to
reduce mobility within the nucleus as assessed by ﬂuorescence
recovery after photobleaching (frap) [12].
ideally, a cell-based bioassay for serms would provide a rapid,
reproducible and robust read-out that mimics effects seen in vivo,
namely stimulation by  xxxg730xxx  agonists and no stimulation by pure
antagonists in any cell type, as well as stimulation by known serms in
bone cells but not in breast cells. however, we know of no published
model that meets these criteria. here, we evaluated a variety of
responses to serms, er agonists and antagonists in different cell
types, in order to identify a serm response which reproduced that to
estrogen in bone but not breast-derived cells. in particular, as well as
using standard approaches in which reporter constructs were used to
evaluate activation of gene transcription, we examined whether
quantiﬁcation of er intracellular compartmentalisation or nuclear
mobility using  xxxg730xxx –gfp chimeras as described above can provide a
more accurate read-out of cell-context-dependent serm effects.
to overcome the limitation that er is primarily nuclear even in unstimulated cells, we also tested for possible effects of er agonists,
antagonists and serms on cellular compartmentalisation of a
ﬂuorescently tagged chimera between the  xxxg1601xxx 
(gr) and er. except that both er and gr sequences were derived from
human cdna, the construct utilised in the present study was similar to
that described by martinez et al. [14], which consisted of a rat gr with
the ligand binding domain (lbd) replaced by the equivalent human er
sequence. the chimera retains helix 1 of the gr lbd, and is known to
bind hsp90 which is important for retention of the un-stimulated gr
in the cytoplasm [13]. hence, unlike the constitutively nuclear er, the
ergr chimera is cytoplasmic when expressed (in nih/3t3-derived
cells) in the absence of hormone, but translocates to the nucleus in
response to e2 [13].
materials and methods
chemicals
e2,  xxxd1878xxx , hexestrol, tamoxifen, 4- xxxd91xxx  (4-ht),
dexamethasone (dex)  xxxg681xxx  (egf) and phorbol
12,13-dibutyrate (pdbu) were purchased from sigma (poole, dorset,
uk),  xxxd2165xxx  (ici) and zk-164015 from tocris (bristol, avon, uk)
and raloxifene from eli lilly (basingstoke, hampshire, uk).
cell culture
human breast cancer cells (mcf7) and human osteosarcoma
(u2os) derived cells were obtained from the european collection of
cell cultures (salisbury, uk). rat osteosarcoma 17/2.8 (ros) cells were
kindly provided by l lanyon, royal veterinary college, london. cells
were maintained in dmem supplemented with 10% foetal calf serum,
l-glutamine (2 mm), penicillin (50 iu/ml) and streptomycin (50 mg/

103

ml) under a humidiﬁed atmosphere of 5% co2 in air at 37 °c, as
described previously [5]. the cells were subcultured twice weekly by
removing the conditioned medium, washing with 2 ml te (0.25%
trypsin, 0.03% edta in phosphate-buffered saline, pbs), and incubating for 5 min with a further 2 ml te, until the cells detached. 3 ml
fresh culture medium was then added and pipetted up and down to
break any clumps. this was then dispensed into a new t75 tissue
culture ﬂask at of ratio of 1:5–1:10, depending on cell type. cells
cultured for experiments were maintained in phenol red-free and
serum-free medium (sfm) with bsa (100 mug/ml) and apo-transferrin
(10 mug/ml).
generation of ergr–gfp
we generated a ﬂuorescently tagged chimera between the gr and
er as a reporter to be used in cell imaging. the pcdna3 eralphagr-gfp
vector encodes a receptor containing the n-terminus, dna binding
domain and hinge regions of the hgr upstream of a hybrid lbd. this
hybrid lbd is made of the hgr helix 1 and partial loop 1–3 sequences
linked (via tcacgaggt) to the heralpha lbd sequences, which start with the
c-terminus loop 1–3. this construct retains helix 1 of the gr lbd
(which binds hsp90 and is important for retention of the unstimulated gr in the cytoplasm) and is similar to that previously
described [14] except that we have used the human  xxxg730xxx  lbd. the
generation of the pcdna3egfp-eralphagr commenced with the polymerase chain reaction (pcr) of primers (5′) gcatcatcgataaaattcgaag (3′)
(primer 1), which includes a cla 1 site and (5′) ggctc-acctcgtgaaacagagctatcatatcctg (3′) (primer 2). primer 2 contained the linker site
too, which was to aid with the annealing of the sequence during the
ﬁnal pcr [14]. the template for this pcr was the pcdna3-egfp-gralpha
plasmid, creating pcr product 1 (pcr1). the template contains the
region of the dna sequence to be ampliﬁed and the primers
determined the beginning of and the end of the sequence to be
ampliﬁed. the second pcr was for primers (5′) tct-tcacgaggtgagccccccatactctattccg (3′) (primer 3) and (5′) catgca-ctcgag-tcagaccgtggcagggaaac (3′) (primer 4) which included an xho 1 site tail.
primer 3 contained the linker sequence, allowing for the annealing of
the heralpha sequence to the hgr sequence. the template for the second
pcr was the egfp- xxxg730xxx  plasmid creating pcr product 2 (pcr2)
following the initial two pcrs the ﬁrst two products were then
puriﬁed using the qiaquick pcr puriﬁcation kit (qiagen). the ﬁnal pcr
used primer 1 and 4 and pcr1 and pcr2 were used as the templates.
the ﬁnal product, which was 1117 bp, was then puriﬁed using the
qiaquick pcr puriﬁcation kit (qiagen). the pcr products and the
pcdna3-egfp-gralpha were then digested with cla 1 and xho 1. cla 1
(at/ xxxg2098xxx ) restricts the pcdna3 egfp vector at 3029 bp and xho 1
(c/tcgag) restricts the vector at 3970 bp. the size of the restricted pcr
product was 1103 bp and the cut vector was 7504 bp (having had
941 bp restricted). the restricted pcr product and vector were then
run on a gel and the bands puriﬁed using qiaquick gel extraction kit
(qiagen). the cla 1 and xho 1 fragment from the pcr product was then
subcloned in frame downstream of the cmv promoter into the
corresponding digest of the pcdna3-egfp-gr (invitrogen).
one shot® top10 chemically competent e. coli cells (invitrogen
life technologies) were transformed by adding 1.5 mul plasmid dna to
15 mul of chemically competent cells. clones were selected by plating
20 mul of the cell suspension on lb agar plates containing 50 mug/ml
ampicillin. discrete colonies were selected and used to inoculate 5 ml
lb broth containing ampicillin at 37 °c overnight in an orbital
incubator. plasmid dna was isolated using a qiaprep spin minprep kit
following manufacturer's instructions (qiagen). the dna concentration was determined by measuring the absorbance, of 1/100 dilution
(in te), at 260 nm in a gene quant ii rna/dna calculator (pharmacia
biotech) using te as a blank. large-scale plasmid dna cultures were
extracted using the qiagen hispeed plasmid maxi kit, according to
manufacturer's instructions (qiagen).

pcdna3.1 encoding the ere-luc (500 ng/well) and beta-gal (200 ng/well) reporters. the cells were then incubated for 48 h with the indicated ligands  xxxd1891xxx − 8 m (left panels), or with the
indicated concentrations of e2, 4-ht and ici (right panels), before processing for measurement of luciferase and beta-gal activity. the data shown are luciferase activity normalised to

plasmid dna was digested in reaction mixtures containing 2.5 mul
dna, 0.25 mul restriction enzymes (bamh1 and xba 1), 2 mul of the
appropriate buffer and distilled water in a ﬁnal volume of 20 mul. the
digest was allowed to proceed for 2–3 h at 37 °c before addition of 4 mul
dna loading buffer. samples were loaded onto a 1% agarose gel
containing a 1:20,000 dilution of ethidium bromide, which was then
subjected to electrophoresis in 1× tae buffer. the dna was viewed
under ultraviolet light using a high performance uv transilluminator
and images were captured using labworks™ image acquisition and
analysis software (both from bioimaging systems, ultra-violet products ltd., cambridge, uk). bamh1 restricts the vector to give
fragments at 723 and 7875 bp; and xba 1 restricts the vector to give
fragments at 667 and 7931 bp. after restriction analysis the vector was
sequenced and the sequence was checked using chromas 2.31 software.
reporter activity assessment
cells were plated in 96 well plates (5 × 103 cells/well) and allowed
to attach for 24 h before transfection with superfect. the cells were cotransfected with vectors encoding ere-luc (500 ng/1well) heralpha
(500 ng/well) and beta-gal (200 ng/well) or were transfected with
500 ng/well gre-luc, 500 ng/well ergr–gfp and 200 ng/well beta-gal.
this was added to serum free dmem making up a total of 30 mul. this
was then mixed with 2.5 mul superfect and allowed to complex for 10 to
15 min. after this 150 mul of serum with medium was added and 150 mul
of this mix was then added to each well. after 2–3 h the wells were
aspirated and washed with pbs. 200 mul serum free and phenol red-free

dmem, supplemented with bsa (100 mug/ml) and apo-transferrin
(10 mug/ml), (serum-free medium, sfm) was added and left to incubate
for 48 h at 37 °c with 5% co2 in air. the cells were then stimulated for
24 or 48 h with test compounds as described in the ﬁgure legends
before being washed in pbs and lysed by freezing and thawing in
reporter assay lysis buffer. 50 mul cell lysate from each well was
transferred to a 96-well luminometer plate (thermo labsystems,
altrincham, cheshire, uk). luciferase activity was assessed by addition
of 100 mul/well luciferin substrate mixture and measurement of
luminescence using an mlx microtitre plate luminometer (dynex
technologies, chantilly, va, usa). beta-gal activity was assessed by
transferring 30 mul cell lysate to a 96-well clear ﬂat-bottomed microtitre
plate (nalge nunc international, rochester, ny) and adding 170 mul
 xxxd24xxx  red-beta-d-galactopyranoside substrate mixture. plates
were incubated at 37 °c to allow a colour change of the substrate
from yellow to orange. optical density was then assessed using a
96-well microtitre plate reader with a 575 nm ﬁlter.
confocal ﬂuorescence microscopy
cells were plated (7 × 104 cell/well) on glass coverslips in 12 well
plates (linbro, oh, usa) and transfected with 2 mug/well ergr–gfp or
 xxxg730xxx –gfp which was added to serum free (non-supplemented serum
free dmem) dmem making up a total of 50 mul. this was then mixed
with 7.5 mul superfect and allowed to complex for 10 to 15 min. after
this 400 mul of serum with media was added to each well. after 2–3 h
the wells were aspirated and washed with phosphate-buffered saline.

fig. 2.  xxxg730xxx –gfp mobility in ros and mcf-7 cells. mcf7 (a) and ros (b) cells were cultured in serum-free and phenol red-free dmem and transfected with pcdna3.1 encoding
 xxxg730xxx –gfp (2 mug/well). the cells were then incubated for 48 h with the indicated ligands  xxxd1891xxx − 8 m, before frap. the data shown are mean ﬂuorescence intensity measured in a region
of interest within the nucleus immediately before and for 85 s after photobleaching. fluorescence in this region was normalised, setting the intensity before bleaching at 100% and
immediately after photobleaching at 0%. the data shown are mean ± sem from 6–9 independent experiments each with at least quadruplicate observations (n = 6–9). for the mcf7
data two way anovas revealed each of the treatment effects to be statistically signiﬁcant (p b 0.01) and post hoc (bonferroni) tests revealed signiﬁcant differences between
control and treatment values. for the ros data, two way anovas and post hoc tests revealed statistically signiﬁcant effects (p b 0.05) only for the ici treatment. the images show the
 xxxg730xxx –gfp immediately after bleaching (top panels) and following 85-second recovery (lower panels) and the scale bars are approximately 10 mum.

500 mul sfm was added and the cells were left to incubate for 48 h at
37 °c with 5% co2 in air before treatment with test compounds.
following the treatments noted in ﬁgure legends images of cells were
acquired for calculating cytoplasmic localisation or for ﬂuorescence
recovery after photobleaching. cells were observed using a confocal
laser-scanning microscope (leica, milton keynes, bucks, uk) with a
543 nm ﬁlter (green hene laser) and 488 nm ﬁlter (65 mw ar laser)
with a ×63 oil immersion lens. analysis of the  xxxg730xxx –gfp localisation
was performed using leica confocal software to calculate integrated
ﬂuorescence intensities which enabled the calculation of the amount
of  xxxg730xxx –gfp in the cytoplasm, as a % of the amount in the whole cell
(cytoplasmic ﬂuorescence %). frap was performed by selecting a
region of interest (roi) within the nucleus and bleaching the roi for
30 s by increasing the 488 and 476 nm lasers to 100% and subsequent
recovery of ﬂuorescence (as gfp- xxxg730xxx  migrated into the roi) was
quantiﬁed over 85 s.
semi-automated wide-ﬁeld ﬂuorescence microscopy and image analysis
cells were transfected with 500 ng/well ergr–gfp and plated as
described above on costar plain black-wall 96 well plates (corning,
arlington, uk) prior to treatment as noted in ﬁgure legends. cells were
then washed in ice cold pbs before ﬁxation in 4% paraformaldehyde/
pbs and permeabilisation in −20 °c methanol. nuclei were stained
using a 10 mug/ml solution of 4′6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (dapi,
sigma). image acquisition in each well was performed on an in cell
analyser 1000 (ge healthcare) microscope, using a ×10 objective and

360 nm (dapi) and 475 nm (gfp) excitation ﬁlters, and monitored
through 460 nm and 535 nm emission ﬁlters, respectively, with a
61002 trichroic mirror (ge healthcare). analysis of ergr–gfp
localisation was performed using the dual area objective analysis
algorithm in the in cell analyser workstation (ge healthcare) with
images collected from the 460 nm and 535 nm emission ﬁlters to
deﬁne nuclear and cytoplasmic regions respectively. non-transfected
cells were excluded by applying a ﬁlter to exclude cells in which whole
cell gfp ﬂuorescence was b10% above background. imaging data are
reported as a ratio of nuclear to cytoplasmic stain intensity (n/c ratio).
statistical analysis
the ﬁgures show means and sems of data pooled from at least 3
separate experiments. statistical analysis was by one or two way
anova and post hoc (dunnett's) tests accepting p b 0.05 as statistically
signiﬁcant. ec50 and ic50 values were calculated by ﬁtting data to
sigmoid curves using graphpad prism (graphpad software inc., la
jolla, ca).

pcdna3.1 encoding  xxxg730xxx –gfp (2 mug/well) and then incubated for 48 h with the indicated ligands  xxxd1891xxx − 8 m. live cell imaging was then used to determine  xxxg730xxx –gfp mobility (a and b)
and localisation (c and d). mobility was assessed by frap (as described under fig. 2). 85-second recovery proﬁles were ﬁtted to a one-phase exponential association curve in order to
calculate the ymax (maximal ﬂuorescence after recovery, as a proportion of ﬂuorescence before bleaching). these values were then used as measures of the proportion of  xxxg730xxx –gfp
that is mobile and this is shown as  xxxg730xxx –gfp mobility (%). to determine  xxxg730xxx –gfp compartmentalisation, integrated ﬂuorescence intensities were used to calculate the amount of

element-luciferase reporter (ere-luc, containing 3 adjacent consensus
eres). as expected, in mcf7 human breast cancer cell lines transiently
transfected with human  xxxg730xxx , er agonists (e2 and  xxxd1878xxx )
stimulated reporter activity, whereas activity was suppressed both
by serms (hexestrol, 4-ht, raloxifene and tamoxifen) and er
antagonists ( xxxd2165xxx  and zk-164015) (fig. 1a). er agonists and
antagonists exerted similar effects in ros cells transiently transfected
with  xxxg730xxx  to those seen in mcf7 cells, whereas inhibition by
serms was replaced by minor stimulation in ros cells (fig. 1b).
dose–response curves revealed similar potencies of e2, 4-ht and ici
182,780 in mcf7 and ros cells (figs. 1c and 1d). in the absence of
exogenous  xxxg730xxx , e2 and  xxxd2165xxx  respectively stimulated and
inhibited ere-luc activity in both cell lines, but the response was
considerably smaller (results not shown).
 xxxg730xxx –gfp chimera studies
an  xxxg730xxx –gfp chimera was then generated and used in frap studies
to compare effects of serms, er agonists and antagonists on receptor
mobility in mcf7 and ros cells (fig. 2). as expected, when a region of
the nucleus was exposed to the full power of the confocal laser beam
the gfp within the excited region was rapidly bleached (ﬂuorescence

reduced by n90% within 30 ss). this was followed by a recovery period
in which ﬂuorescence (within the bleached region) increased as
 xxxg730xxx –gfp migrated into the bleached region. in control mcf7 and ros
cells, the ﬂuorescence increased (half-time of approximately 20 s),
attaining 30–40% of the pre-bleach value within 85 s, providing a
measure of the proportion of receptors that are mobile in the absence
of exogenous ligand. in mcf7 cells, pre-treatment for 48 h with ici
182,780 almost completely prevented ﬂuorescence recovery and the
serm 4-ht reduced recovery to 12 ± 0.2% whereas e2 increased
recovery to 41.2 ± 0.5% (from 32.8 ± 0.5% in control cells) (mean ± sem).
in contrast, e2 and 4-ht had no measurable effect on recovery in ros
cells and although  xxxd2165xxx  reduced recovery (from 38.3 ± 0.4% to
20.0 ± 0.5%) it did not cause the pronounced reduction in mobility seen
in mcf7 cells.
the same protocol was employed to compare effects of other
ligands on nuclear receptor mobility. in these experiments the
recovery data were ﬁtted to one-phase exponential association curves
in order to estimate the plateau value (ymax, maximal ﬂuorescence
after recover, as a % of ﬂuorescence before bleaching) as a measure of
the proportion of  xxxg730xxx –gfp that is mobile. in mcf7 cells,  xxxg730xxx –gfp
mobility was increased by e2, reduced by serms and further reduced
by er antagonists (fig. 3a). in contrast, agonists and serms had no

larger cell numbers by means of semi-automated wide-ﬁeld ﬂuorescence microscopy and image analysis in 96 well culture plates. for most experiments 3 ﬁelds of view were taken

1000 cells in each experiment. panels i and j show dapi and ergr–gfp images respectively (for approximately 50% of a single representative ﬁeld of view). the dual area objective
analysis algorithm in the in cell analyser workstation (ge healthcare) was then used to segment the images (e.g. to deﬁne the nuclear perimeter from the dapi stain and the cell
perimeter from the gfp ﬂuorescence). panel k illustrates the segmentation with nuclei shown by light blue or mauve lines, and cell perimeters shown by red or green lines. it also
shows the ﬁltering process, with ergr–gfp expressing cells having green perimeters and ergr–gfp negative cells having red perimeters. transfection efﬁciency was typically
5–20%. figure l shows a greater magniﬁcation of the area in the box of panel k and illustrates the fact that, in these e2-treated cells the ergr–gfp reporter is clearly concentrated in
the nucleus.

measurable effect on  xxxg730xxx –gfp mobility in ros cells and although er
antagonists reduced receptor mobility, their effects were less marked
than in mcf7 cells (fig. 3b). thus, there is a clear distinction between
effects of serms on  xxxg730xxx –gfp mobility (reduction in mcf7 cells and
lack of effect in ros cells, fig. 3), just as in their effect on
transcriptional activity (inhibition in mcf7 cells and mild stimulation
in ros cells, fig. 1).
to quantify possible effects of different er ligands on intracellular
compartmentalisation, cytoplasmic ﬂuorescence as a proportion of
total cytoplasmic and nuclear ﬂuorescence was calculated. none of the
treatments measurably altered whole cell  xxxg730xxx –gfp levels in either
cell type (not shown). the er agonists both reduced the proportion of
 xxxg730xxx –gfp in the cytoplasm in both cell types, and this was also
reduced by all serms in ros cells and by raloxifene in mcf7 cells. in
contrast the proportion of  xxxg730xxx –gfp in the cytoplasm was increased by
both antagonists in ros cells and by zk-164015 in mcf7 cells (figs. 3c
and 3d).

ergr–gfp chimera studies
using our  xxxg730xxx –gfp chimera, little difference was observed in
effects of serms on nuclear compartmentalisation in mcf7 and ros
cells and this may reﬂect the fact that er is largely conﬁned to the
nucleus in both cell types, even in the absence of ligand. to overcome
this limitation, we generated an ergr–gfp chimera in which the
human gr ligand binding domain was replaced with equivalent
sequences from human  xxxg730xxx . confocal microscopy conﬁrmed
that ergr–gfp was distributed throughout the cytoplasm of unstimulated mcf7 and ros cells, while exposure to e2 increased
the proportion in the nucleus, whereas dex had no such effect
(figs. 4a–h). in addition, 4-ht increased nuclear ergr–gfp in ros but
not mcf7 cells. in order to quantify these effects in larger cell
numbers, we used a wide-ﬁeld microscope based system for semiautomated image acquisition and analysis (in cell 1000). automated
image segmentation was used to deﬁne nuclear and cytoplasmic

108

interestingly, serms increased the nuclear:cytoplasmic ratio of ergr–
gfp in ros cells but had no effect in mcf7 cells. since these
differences might reﬂect those in species (rather than the tissue) from
which cell lines were derived, we performed similar experiments with
a human osteosarcoma cell line (u2os). as shown, results obtained in
u2os cells were similar to those in ros cells (fig. 5c). in both cases,
the nuclear:cytoplasmic ratio of ergr–gfp was increased by e2 and
each serm, but not  xxxd2165xxx .
a similar rat ergr–gfp chimera has been shown to stimulate greluc reporter activity following activation by er agonists in several cell
types [13] so we examined whether serms also preferentially
stimulate gre-luc reporter activity, in ros cells co-transfected with
our human ergr–gfp construct. as expected, er agonists caused a
pronounced increase in gre-luc activity, whereas er antagonists were
without effect, in mcf7, ros and u2os cells (figs. 6a–c). dex failed to
increase gre-luc activity in these cells, demonstrating that the ergr–
gfp construct is not activated by dex and that the cells express too few
endogenous gr for measurable gre-luc activation. interestingly, all
four serms had little or no effect on gre-luc activity in mcf7 cells but
caused pronounced activation in ros and u2os cells. subsequent
dose–response studies conﬁrmed that whereas e2 caused similar
dose-dependent increases in gre-luc activity in mcf7 and ros cells
co-transfected with ergr–gfp, there was a striking discrepancy in
their response to 4-ht (figs. 6d and e).
ligand responses for  xxxg730xxx -mediated activation of ere-luc (fig. 1)
were smaller than those observed for ergr-mediated activation of
gre-luc (fig. 6), which may have reﬂected differences in the extent of
ligand-independent activation: serum growth factors are expected to
activate signalling pathways leading to phosphorylation within the nterminal a/b domain of the  xxxg730xxx ; absence of this er sequence
(replaced by the corresponding region from the hgr) within the
ergr/gfp construct would preclude such ligand independent activation, resulting in greater sensitivity to ligand. to test this, we assessed
effects of egf and a protein kinase c (pkc) activating  xxxd2925xxx 
(pdbu) on transcriptional responses to  xxxg730xxx /gfp and ergr/gfp
constructs. as expected, e2 caused a dose-dependent stimulation of
ere-luc in  xxxg730xxx  expressing mcf7 and ros cells. egf and pdbu also
caused dose-dependent increases in ere-luc activity and synergistically increased e2 effects in mcf7 (figs. 7a and b) and ros (figs. 7d
and e) cells transfected with  xxxg730xxx /gfp. in contrast, when mcf7 and
ros cells were transfected with the ergr/gfp and gre-luc constructs,
egf and pdbu failed to increase luc activity or to synergise with e2 in
either cell type (figs. 7c and f), suggesting that unlike  xxxg730xxx /gfp, ergr/
gfp is resistant to activation by ligand-independent pathways.

fig. 5. effects of ligands on cellular localisation of ergr–gfp in mcf7, ros and u2os
cells. mcf7 (a), ros (b) and u2os (c) cells were cultured in serum-free and phenol redfree dmem and transfected with pcdna3.1 encoding ergr–gfp (500 ng/well). they
were then incubated for 16 h in control serum-free media or in serum-free media with
indicated ligand (10− 8 m). semi-automated wide ﬁeld ﬂuorescence microscopy and
imaging were then used to quantify integrated ﬂuorescence values of ergr–gfp within
the nucleus and cytoplasm (as above) and these values were used to calculate the
nucler:cytoplasmic (n/c) ergr–gfp ratio. the data shown are the mean ± sem from 5
independent experiments showing the n/c ratio normalised to the values in control
cells (n = 5). one way anova revealed the treatments were statistically signiﬁcant
(p b 0.05) and post hoc (dunnett's) tests revealed statistically signiﬁcant differences to

regions and to determine the ratio of nuclear to cytoplasmic ergr–
gfp ﬂuorescence (figs. 4i–l).
in subsequent studies using a range of ligands with the in cell 1000
analysis system, er agonists were found to increase the nuclear:
cytoplasmic ratio of ergr–gfp in mcf7 and ros cells, whereas
dex and er antagonists had no measurable effect (figs. 5a and b).

in recent years fusion proteins of receptors with gfp have been
increasingly used as biosensors for receptor activation and several
groups have reported agonist effects on distribution and/or mobility of
 xxxg730xxx –gfp chimeras within the nucleus [12,14]. however, to our
knowledge, no previous studies have used this approach to examine
 xxxg730xxx  nuclear mobility in osteoblasts. in mcf7 cells, broadly similar
effects of ligand exposure on  xxxg730xxx  nuclear mobility were observed to
those previously reported in hela cells, with serms causing partial
slowing of recovery and antagonists a more complete immobilisation
[12,14]. however, whereas e2 was also found to slow recovery in hela
cells, though to a lesser extent than that observed with tamoxifen or
4-ht, it appeared to enhance recovery in mcf7 cells. in contrast, in
ros cells, neither e2 nor serms affected recovery, and whereas pure
antagonists delayed recovery, immobilisation to the extent seen in
hela or mcf7 cells did not occur. in terms of the functional
implications of these observations, mobility of  xxxg730xxx  within the
nucleus, as detected by frap, has been found to be a proteasomedependent process [14]. proteasome-function is in turn dependent on
transcriptional activity, such that reduced heralpha-mediated

fig. 6. regulation of gre-luc activity in cells co-transfected with ergr–gfp. mcf7 (a), ros (b) and u2os (c) cells were cultured in serum-free and phenol red-free dmem and cotransfected with pcdna3.1 encoding ergr–gfp (500 ng/well), gre-luc (500 ng/well) and beta-gal (200 ng/well) reporters. cells were then incubated for 24 h with the indicated
ligands  xxxd1891xxx - 8 m before processing for measurement of luciferase and beta-gal activity. in dose–response studies, mcf7 (d) and ros (e) cells were exposed to concentrations of e2, 4-ht
and ici as shown. the data shown are luciferase activity normalised to beta-gal activity and are the mean ± sem from 6 independent experiments, each with quadruplicate observations
(n = 6). ec50 values were 1.4 × 10− 10 m for e2 in mcf7 cells, and 8.3 × 10− 11 m, 7.5 × 10− 10 m, for e2 and 4-ht (respectively) in ros cells. one way anova revealed the treatments were
statistically signiﬁcant (p b 0.05) and post hoc (dunnett's) tests revealed statistically signiﬁcant differences to control values at ⁎p b 0.05, ⁎⁎p b 0.01, ⁎⁎⁎p b 0.001.

transactivation impairs proteasome-mediated degradation and receptor turnover [15]. consequently, the tendency for serms to delay
recovery in mcf7 and hela cells but not ros cells is consistent with
the view that serms act as global er antagonists in mcf7 and hela
cells but as agonists in ros cells.
recently, martinez et al. developed a biosensor consisting of the
gr in tandem with gfp and with its lbd replaced with that from the
rat  xxxg730xxx  [13]. this is primarily cytoplasmic but translocates to the
nucleus when activated by er agonists, providing a more robust

morphological read-out. hence, we examined whether this system
might provide a more suitable in vitro assay for tissue-selective
estrogenic activation of osteoblasts by serms. as expected, the
human ergr/gfp fusion protein which we generated for this
purpose, like the previously described rat ergr/gfp construct [13],
was primarily cytoplasmic but translocated to the nucleus on
stimulation with e2 but not in response to the gr agonist, dex.
interestingly, we saw no ergr/gfp translocation in breast or bone
cells stimulated with either of the pure antagonists, but whereas the

fig. 7. functional interaction between e2 and pdbu or e2 and egf in  xxxg730xxx -dependent ere-luc activation but not ergr-dependent gre-luc activation. mcf7 (a–c) and ros (d–f) cells
were cultured in serum-free and phenol red-free dmem and co-transfected with pcdna3.1 encoding  xxxg730xxx  and ere-luc (a–e) or with ergr–gfp and gre-luc (c and f) (each at
500 ng/well) and beta-gal (200 ng/well) reporters. the cells were then incubated for 24 h with the indicated concentration of e2 either alone or in the presence of egf (10− 11, 10− 9 or
10− 7 m) or pdbu (10− 8, 10− 7 or 10− 6 m) as indicated, before processing for measurement of luciferase and beta-gal activity. the data shown are luciferase activity normalised to beta-gal
activity and are the mean ± sem from 3–5 independent experiments, each with quadruplicate observations (n = 3–5). two way anovas (performed for each panel) revealed e2 to be a
signiﬁcant variable (p b 0.001) for each cell/reporter combination. egf and pdbu were also signiﬁcant sources of variation in each of the experiments with cells expressing  xxxg730xxx  and
ere-luc (upper and middle panels, p b 0.001) but not in the experiments with cells expressing ergr–sgfp and gre-luc (lower panels, p n 0.05).

four serms likewise had no effect on nuclear translocation in breast
cells, they all stimulated nuclear translocation of ergr/gfp in bone
cells (ros and u2os).
based on previous evidence that a similar rat ergr–gfp chimera
stimulates gre-luc reporter activity following activation by er
agonists in several cell types [13], we applied this method to examine
possible cell context-dependent effects of serms. the serms and er
antagonists had either weak or no measurable effects on gre-luc
reporter activity in the presence of ergr/gfp in mcf7 cells whereas
all four serms caused marked stimulation of gre-luc transcription in
the two bone cell lines. tamoxifen 10− 5 m was previously found to
stimulate gre-luc activity in a nih/3t3 murine ﬁbroblast-derived cell
line stably transfected with ergr [13], which is considerably higher
than the concentration of 10− 8 m used here, whereas lower doses
were without effect. several lines of evidence support the fact that

these ﬁndings represent an important feature of serm-dependent
stimulation of estrogenic pathways in osteoblasts. for example, both
human and rat-derived osteoblast-like cell lines showed similar
responses, all four serms tested showed equivalent effects, a
substantial response was observed to serms which was similar in
magnitude to that after  xxxg730xxx  agonists, and the response to e2 and 4-ht
occurred over an equivalent dose range. however, further studies are
required to conﬁrm that similar responses occur in other osteoblastlike cells, including primary cultures.
it was noteworthy that the ergr/gre-luc system could mimic
tissue-selective activation by serms in osteoblasts, in spite of the fact
that this appeared to be resistant to activation by protein kinases, as
reﬂected by the fact that pdbu and egf failed to increase gre-luc
activity in breast or bone cells expressing ergr/gfp, whereas both
caused pronounced stimulation (and synergy with e2) in cells

b.s. maru et al. / bone 44 (2009) 102–112

expressing  xxxg730xxx  and ere-luc. the lack of activation of ergr by protein
kinases, which play an important role in augmenting er signalling
[16], presumably reﬂects the fact that the ergr/gfp construct
generated herein contains only the lbd of the er and lacks the
s102/4, s118, s167, s236 and s305 sites phosphorylated by erk, rsk,
akt and pka to mediate ligand-independent (i.e. e2-independent but
protein kinase-dependent) activation [17]. although serine residues in
the n-terminal domain (ntd) of the gr are also subject to
phosphorylation, modulation of functions such as ligand binding or
co-factor recruitment are likely to involve interactions between the
ntd and the lbd domains that we predict would be compromised by
the heterologous nature of these domains in the ergr chimera.
it is well established that many stimuli acting via  xxxg2198xxx 
receptors (tkrs) and g-protein coupled receptors (gpcrs) can
stimulate er and alter the balance of agonist/antagonist effects
caused by serms [17–19]. however, although some studies suggest
that tissue-selective activation of osteoblasts involves the targeting of
these extra-nuclear pathways [20], the present observations imply
that protein kinase-dependent activation is not necessary for cell
context dependency of serm action. the lack of competing ligand
independent activation of ergr may also provide an explanation for
the greater fold increase in reporter activity induced by serms in
osteoblasts transfected with ergr as opposed to  xxxg730xxx . however,
against this suggestion, our studies were performed in serum-free
conditions which are likely to have minimised the level of ligand
independent stimulation. moreover, if ligand independent stimulation
contributed signiﬁcantly to ere-luc but not gre-luc activity, this may
have been expected to lead to higher baseline levels of reporter
activity in the former, which was not found to be the case.
these experimental observations also provide some interesting
insights into the molecular mechanisms which underlie the cell context
dependency of serm effects on osteoblasts. in view of the link between
nuclear mobility and transactivation as discussed above [14], the
differences in nuclear mobility of the  xxxg730xxx /gfp construct between
bone and breast cancer cells following treatment with serms which we
observed is consistent with the view that distinct repertoires of nuclear
co-regulatory proteins between cell types underlies the cell contextdependent activity of serms [11]. however, this would not explain
differences in cytoplasmic to nuclear translocation of the ergr/gfp
construct between breast and bone cells in response to serms which
were also seen, pointing to the role of other mechanisms which operate
outside the nucleus. the latter might include chaperone proteins such as
heat shock proteins 70 and 90, which regulate trafﬁcking of glucocorticoid receptors both into and within the nucleus [21]. for example, hsp90 has been found to regulate gr nuclear mobility as assessed by frap
[22]. moreover, hsp-70 has also been implicated in transcriptional
repression of un-liganded  xxxg730xxx  [23].
a potential limitation of these ﬁndings with respect to the mode of
action of serms in bone is that, although we have focussed on estrogenic
effects on osteoblasts, it is clear that direct effects on osteoclasts also play
an important role, which were not addressed here, including the recently
described up-regulation of  xxxd3135xxx  by estrogen in osteoclasts [24].
moreover, although we have included studies of  xxxg730xxx , we have yet to
extend our analyses to  xxxg731xxx -dependent effects. in light of evidence that
loss of function  xxxg730xxx  mutations cause bone loss in humans [25], and
deﬁciency of  xxxg730xxx  but not  xxxg731xxx  prevents estrogen-induced bone
formation in mice [26,27], it may be that estrogen-dependent effects
on osteoblasts are predominantly mediated via  xxxg730xxx . nonetheless, it is
recognised that  xxxg731xxx  is also expressed at relatively high levels in
osteoblasts [28–30], and there is some evidence to suggest that  xxxg731xxx  is
involved in mediating serm effects on osteoblasts through the formation
of eralphaerbeta heterodimers [31]. in addition, it is possible that estrogenic
effects on osteoblasts involve a distinct extra-nuclear receptor, gpr30
[32], which we are keen to study in future investigations.
in conclusion, we found that ergr-mediated gre-luc activity
responds to estrogen agonists and serms in a cell context dependent

111

manner closely resembling that seen in vivo. in addition, the response
magnitude using this system was considerably enhanced, resulting in a
much stronger signal to noise ratio, compared with alternative methods
based on osteoblast-like cells transfected with  xxxg730xxx . moreover, ergrmediated gre-luc activity appeared to be resistant to growth factor or
protein kinase modiﬁcation, rendering it a reliable and sensitive tool for
serm screening. further studies utilising this system are justiﬁed to
explore the mechanistic basis for estrogenic stimulation of osteoblast
activity, and to identify newer serms capable of targeting this activity.
