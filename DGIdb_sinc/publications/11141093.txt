in a search for less flexible analogues of caproctamine (1), a diamine diamide endowed with
an interesting ache affinity profile, we discovered compound 2, in which the terminal
2-methoxybenzyl groups of 1 have been incorporated into a tricyclic system. since this compound
retains good ache inhibitory activity and its hexahydrochromeno[4,3-b]pyrrole moiety is
reminiscent of the hexahydropyrrolo[2,3-b]indole of physostigmine (3), we have designed and
synthesized carbamates 4-6, and their biological evaluation has been assessed in vitro against
human ache and  xxxg248xxx . the 6-carbamate 4 was almost as potent as physostigmine and was
60- and 550-fold more potent than the 7-carbamate 5 and the 8-carbamate 6, respectively. the
two enantiomers of 4, (-)-4 and (+)-4, did not show a marked enantioselectivity. finally, a
similar time-dependent pattern of inhibition of ache was observed for 3 and 4.
introduction
acetylcholinesterase (ache) is the enzyme involved
in the hydrolysis of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine
(ach) at cholinergic synapses in the central and peripheral nervous systems. inhibitors of ache activity
promote an increase in the concentration and the
duration of action of synaptic ach, thus causing an
enhancement of the cholinergic transmission through
activation of the synaptic nicotinic and muscarinic
receptors.
in a previous study1 we were interested in developing
noncovalent inhibitors of ache based on a polyamine
backbone for potential use against alzheimer’s disease
because this type of inhibitor, through binding at a
peripheral anionic site, might affect amyloid formation,2
which appears to be accelerated by ache during an
early step in the development of the senile plaques. this
research led to the discovery of caproctamine (1), a
diamine diamide endowed with an interesting affinity
profile toward ache.1 in a related study on polyamines
as muscular nicotinic receptor noncompetitive antagonists in order to determine whether flexibility is an
important determinant of potency with respect to cholinergic receptors, we designed polyamines with less
flexible moieties.3 among other modifications, the terminal 2-methoxybenzyl groups of polyamines were
incorporated into a hexahydrochromeno[4,3-b]pyrrole
system to verify whether the spatial relationship of the
methoxy moiety relative to the amine function differentially affects affinity for nicotinic and muscarinic
receptors. since the hexahydrochromeno[4,3-b]pyrrole
moiety is reminiscent of the hexahydropyrrolo[2,3-b]indole system of physostigmine, a classical inhibitor of

ache that is used widely in medicine,4 it stimulated
our interest in designing new physostigmine-related
compounds to verify whether the new ring system may
act as a suitable molecular scaffold in ache recognition.
to this end, as a preliminary step, we synthesized
compound 2 and tested it for ache activity. interestingly, it turned out to be as active as benextramine, a
tetraamine disulfide which served as the basis for the
design of the diamine diamide caproctamine (1).1 this
finding suggests clearly that the terminal ring system
contributes to the affinity for ache owing to the
observation that polyamines lacking substituents on the
terminal nitrogen atoms only very weakly inhibited
ache.1 since it was known that removal of the carbamate group from the physostigmine structure leads
to a dramatic decrease in the affinity for ache,5 we
reached the conclusion that the inclusion, at an appropriate position, of a carbamate moiety into the
hexahydrochromeno[4,3-b]pyrrole system might produce
potent ache inhibitors. to this end, we synthesized
carbamates 4-6. furthermore, the enantiomers of the
most potent derivative 4 were investigated to verify the
importance, if any, of stereochemistry on the affinity for
ache. the quaternary derivative 7 has been included
in this study to verify further the role of a permanent
positive charge on affinity.
chemistry
the design strategy for our compounds is shown in
figure 1. all compounds were synthesized by standard
procedures (scheme 1) and were characterized by ir,
1h nmr, mass spectra, and elemental analysis. diamine diamide 2 was synthesized as previously reported.3

hexahydrochromeno[4,3-b]pyrroles,6 a cis fusion ring
was assigned to 11-13 since the benzylic methine
proton exhibited a coupling constant in the range 5-7
hz, which is a typical constant value for a cis relationship.
enantiomers (+)-4 and (-)-4 were obtained by hplc
chromatographic resolution of racemic 4. they were
separated in 20 min (tr ) 8.5 and 19 min for (+)-4 and
(-)-4, respectively) with a resolution factor of 6.2. the
enantiomeric excess (ee) was higher than 99.0% for both
enantiomers.
results and discussion

compounds was synthesized by following an adapted
procedure reported for related unsubstituted compounds.3,6 thus, starting from n-methylglycine and the
appropriate substituted 2-allyloxybenzaldehyde, compounds 11-13 were obtained, which, upon treatment
with bbr3, afforded phenols 8-10. the carbamate
functionality was introduced by reaction of methyl
isocyanate with 8-10, affording 4-6. quaternary derivative 7 was obtained by treatment of 5 with methyl
iodide.
the stereochemistry of the ring fusion in compounds
11-13, and as a consequence in the compounds that
were obtained starting from them, was deduced from
the coupling constant of hydrogens at the ring junction.
thus, in agreement with similar assignments for other

physostigmine (3) has been utilized widely in medicine for the treatment of several disorders, including
paralytic ileum and atony of the bladder, glaucoma,
myasthenia gravis, termination of the actions of competitive neuromuscular nicotinic antagonists, and overcoming intoxication with atropine and other drugs such
as tricyclic antidepressants and phenothiazines.4 more
recently, it is being used also in the experimental
treatment of alzheimer’s disease.4 however, 3 suffers
from a short half-life, variable bioavailability, and a
narrow therapeutic index, which may account for the
inconsistent clinical efficacy and for the continuing effort
to design more selective and more stable analogues.4,5,7-15
we report, herein, the synthesis and initial pharmacological evaluation of compounds 4-8 and enantiomers
(+)-4 and (-)-4 against human ache and  xxxg248xxx  ( xxxg248xxx ), compared to those of caproctamine
(1), its constrained analogue (2), and physostigmine (3).
an analysis of the results shown in table 1 reveals
that the position of the carbamate moiety in the phenyl
ring is of paramount importance for the anticholinesterase activity. the 6-substituted derivative 4 is 60-550fold more potent than 5 and 6, which bear the carbamate group at position 7 and 8, respectively, at both ache
and  xxxg248xxx . substituted hexahydrochromeno[4,3-b]pyrroles 4-6 did not discriminate, like physostigmine (3),
between ache and  xxxg248xxx . as expected,4 the quaternary
derivative 7 was as active as the parent tertiary amino

derivative 5. similarly, the finding that the phenolic
compound 8, lacking the carbamate function, was more
than 3 orders of magnitude less potent than 4 at both
ache and  xxxg248xxx  parallels the result observed following
removal of the carbamate group from the physostigmine
structure.5
it is known that inhibition of both ache and  xxxg248xxx 
by 3 is highly enantioselective, resting almost exclusively on the  xxxd953xxx  enantiomer.5 however, enantiomers
(-)-4 and (+)-4 did not follow the same trend as revealed
by a comparison of their pic50 values at ache and
 xxxg248xxx . it turned out that (-)-4 was 3- and 14-fold more
potent than enantiomer (+)-4 at ache and  xxxg248xxx ,
respectively. an analysis of dreiding stereomodels of
reference compound 3 ( xxxd953xxx  enantiomer), enantiomers
(-)-4 and (+)-4, and compounds 5 and 6 revealed that
only (-)-4 can be superimposed rather easily to 3, which
might explain why 5 and 6 were significantly less potent
than both 3 and (-)-4. however, this reasoning does not
apply to (+)-4, which was only slightly less potent than
the other enantiomer. although the reason for this
discrepancy is not clear yet, the low enantioselectivity
observed for the enantiomers of 4 is not surprising as
other physostigmine derivatives also showed a similar
pattern.5 interestingly, the nh group of the carbamate
function and the nuclear oxygen of the dehydropyran
ring of 4 are in a suitable position for the formation of
a hydrogen bond, which may have relevance because it
could stabilize a conformation close to that required for
the interaction with the enzyme. a study is in progress
to verify this hypothesis.
as previously reported,16-18 the inhibition of ache
by 3 involves a reversible complex formation followed
by carbamylation of the enzyme, yielding a covalent
adduct. the carbamylated enzyme is then hydrolyzed
to regenerate the free enzyme according to the following
mechanism:

where e and i are the enzyme and the inhibitor,
respectively. the carbamylation phase of the reaction
is considerably more rapid than the decarbamylation
phase, that is k3 > k5, and therefore the successive
phases can be characterized separately.18
to compare the mode of action of 4 to 3, their
equilibrium (kc ) k2/k1) and rate (k3) constants were
calculated by performing a traditional stopped assay.17
inhibitor-ache complex constant kc and the rate
constant k3 calculated for 4 were comparable with those
found for 3 (table 2). this would suggest a similar ‘timedependent’ pattern of inhibition for the two examined
inhibitors. the physostigmine rate constant k3 value
was similar to that obtained with bovine ache (10.8 (
0.34 min-1).16 similarly, the kc value calculated for 3
was in agreement with the value reported in the
literature.18

in conclusion, the most interesting finding of the
present investigation is that the hexahydropyrrolo[2,3b]indole moiety of physostigmine (3) can be replaced by
a hexahydrochromeno[4,3-b]pyrrole, as in 4, without
affecting the affinity for ache. clearly, compound 4
could form a lead for the development of new ache
inhibitors. however, it remains to determine whether
this new scaffold ring system improves the stability of
the compound relative to the prototype.

a jasco hplc system consisting of a jasco pu-980 solvent
delivery system equipped with a reodyne model 7125 injector
with a 20-µl sample loop. the eluents were monitored by a
jasco md 910 diode array detector set at 260 nm and
connected to a computer station. the chromatographic column
was a chiracel od (250 × 4.6 mm i.d.) (daicel chemical

brief articles
the single enantiomers (+)-4 and (-)-4 were obtained by
chromatographic resolution of racemic 4 using the same
condition as for the analytical separation. low-loading repetitive injections (60 µg each injection, one injection every 25 min)
allowed the collection of about 1 mg of each enantiomeric
fraction in about 15 h. all solvents used for the preparation of
the mobile phases were hplc grade from merck.
inhibition of ache and  xxxg248xxx . the method of ellmann
et al. was followed.20 five different concentrations of each
compound were used in order to obtain inhibition of ache or
 xxxg248xxx  activity comprised between 20% and 80%. the assay
solution consisted of a 0.1 m phosphate buffer ph 8.0, with
the addition of 340 µm 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid), 0.035
unit/ml ache or  xxxg248xxx  derived from human erythrocytes (0.5
and 3.4 ui/mg, respectively; sigma chemical), and 550 µm
acetylthiocoline iodide. test compounds were added to the
assay solution and preincubated with the enzyme for 20 min
followed by the addition of substrate. assays were done with
a blank containing all components except ache or  xxxg248xxx  in
order to account for nonenzymatic reaction. the reaction rates
were compared, and the percent inhibition due to the presence
of test compounds was calculated. each concentration was
analyzed in triplicate, and ic50 values were determined
graphically from log concentration-inhibition curves.
kinetic characterization of ache inhibition. the
stopped time assay was performed,17 in which ache and
inhibitors physostigmine and 4 at five concentrations comprised between 10 and 200 nm were mixed in the assay buffer
ph 8.0, and at specific incubation time intervals at 37 °c, the
determination of residual activity of the ache-catalyzed
hydrolysis of acetylthiocholine was followed spectrophotometrically at 412 nm. each concentration was analyzed in
triplicate. a parallel control, that is with no inhibitor in the
mixture, allowed to adjust activities measured at various
times. k3 and kc values were calculated as the mean of two
independent measurements.
