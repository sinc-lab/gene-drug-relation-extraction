abstract
a human mitochondrial isozyme of c1-tetrahydrofolate (thf) synthase was previously identiwed by its similarity to the human cytoplasmic  xxxg1473xxx . all c1-thf synthases characterized to date, from yeast to human, are trifunctional, containing the activities of
5,10-methylene-thf dehydrogenase, 5,10-methenyl-thf cyclohydrolase, and 10-formyl-thf synthetase. here we report on the enzymatic characterization of the recombinant human mitochondrial isozyme. enzyme assays of puriwed human mitochondrial  xxxg1473xxx  protein revealed only the presence of 10-formyl-thf synthetase activity. gel wltration and crosslinking studies indicated that
human mitochondrial  xxxg1473xxx  exists as a homodimer in solution. steady-state kinetic characterization of the 10-formyl-thf
synthetase activity was performed using (6r,s)-h4-pteglu1, (6r,s)-h4-pteglu3, and (6r,s)-h4-pteglu5 substrates. the (6r,s)-h4-pteglun km dropped from greater than 500 m for the monoglutamate to 15 m and 3.6 m for the tri- and pentaglutamates, respectively.
the km values for formate and atp also are lowered when thf polyglutamates are used. the formate km dropped 79-fold and the atp
km dropped more than 5-fold when (6r,s)-h4-pteglu5 was used as the substrate in place of (6r,s)-h4-pteglu1.

prised of parallel cytosolic and mitochondrial pathways [1]
(fig. 1). thf can be charged with a one-carbon unit in
either compartment via the serine hydroxymethyltransferase (shmt) reaction (reaction 4), resulting in the formation of 5,10-methylene-thf. in the mitochondria, 5,10methylene-thf can also be formed by the glycine cleavage
reaction (reaction 5), and by sarcosine dehydrogenase and
dimethylglycine dehydrogenase reactions (not shown) [2].
5,10-methylene-thf can be oxidized to 5,10-methenylthf by 5,10-methylene-thf dehydrogenase (reaction 3),
and the 5,10-methenyl-thf can be hydrolyzed to 10-formyl-thf by 5,10-methenyl-thf cyclohydrolase (reaction
2). 10-formyl-thf can either be broken down to formate
and thf by 10-formyl-thf synthetase (reaction 1), or
oxidized to form co2 and thf by 10-formyl-thf dehydrogenase (reaction 6; found in mammals but not yeast).

fig. 1. compartmentation of folate-mediated one-carbon metabolism in eukaryotes based on saccharomyces cerevisiae model. reactions 1, 2, and 3, 10formyl-thf synthetase ( xxxg1473xxx ), 5,10-methenyl-thf cyclohydrolase (ec 3.5.4.9) and 5,10-methylene-thf dehydrogenase (ec 1.5.1.5). in the cytoplasm, reactions 1–3 are catalyzed by the trifunctional c1- xxxg814xxx . the other reactions are catalyzed by 4, serine hydroxymethyltransferase (ec 2.1.2.1); 5, glycine cleavage system ( xxxg156xxx ); 6, 10-formyl-thf dehydrogenase ( xxxg131xxx ) (found in mammals but not s. cerevisiae). not all
coenzymes are shown for all reactions.

dehydrogenase, 5,10-methenyl-thf cyclohydrolase, and
10-formyl-thf synthetase (fig. 1, reactions 1–3) are present on one polypeptide called  xxxg1473xxx  [3–9]. trifunctional  xxxg1473xxx  has been shown to be a
homodimer of 100 kda subunits. each subunit consists of a
»30 kda n-terminal domain which contains the 5,10-methylene-thf dehydrogenase and 5,10-methenyl-thf cyclohydrolase activities, and a »70 kda c-terminal domain
which contains the 10-formyl-thf synthetase activity [3–
8,10,11].
yeast mitochondria also contain a trifunctional c1-thf
synthase [10], and it has been shown in yeast that the mitochondrial pathway produces one-carbon units in the form
of formate for export to the cytoplasm [12,13]. the enzymes
involved in folate-mediated one-carbon metabolism in
adult mammalian mitochondria are less clear. intact adult
rat liver mitochondria readily produce formate and co2
from the three-carbon of serine in a process that requires
no additional cofactors [14,15]. this indicates that all the
enzymes and cofactors necessary for oxidation of the onecarbon unit carried by thf are present in the mitochondrial matrix.
we previously identiwed the gene and cdna encoding
the human mitochondrial  xxxg1473xxx  [16]. based on
amino acid sequence similarity, the human mitochondrial
protein possesses the same domain structure as the
previously characterized trifunctional c1-thf synthases.
however, the human mitochondrial protein contains a »60
amino acid n-terminal extension not present in cytoplasmic
 xxxg1473xxx  homologs. the wrst half of this n-termi-

nal extension has the characteristics of a mitochondrial
presequence, whereas the second half has an unusual run of
nine glycines and several positively charged residues.
when the full-length cdna is expressed in cho cells, the
protein localizes exclusively to mitochondria [16,17], and
the n-terminus is cleaved after residue 31 [17], leaving the
glycine-rich n-terminal extension on the mature protein.
overexpression of the full-length cdna in s. cerevisiae
resulted in a 9-fold increase in 10-formyl-thf synthetase
activity in crude cell extracts, but 5,10-methylene-thf
dehydrogenase activity could not be detected, suggesting
that this mammalian mitochondrial  xxxg1473xxx 
might not be trifunctional. furthermore, christensen
et al. [18] recently reported that nadp-dependent methylene-thf dehydrogenase activity could not be detected in
mitochondria from an immortalized wbroblast cell line
that lacks cytosolic  xxxg1473xxx  activities. on the
other hand, mitochondrial 10-formyl-thf synthetase
activity was easily detectable, leading christensen et al. to
propose that mitochondrial  xxxg1473xxx  is monofunctional in mammals.
to clarify the nature of mammalian mitochondrial
 xxxg1473xxx , a cdna encoding the human mitochondrial  xxxg1473xxx  was expressed in e. coli,
puriwed and enzymatically characterized. in contrast to
the trifunctional mitochondrial  xxxg1473xxx  from
s. cerevisiae, the human protein appears to be a monofunctional 10-formyl-thf synthetase. the oligomeric
state of the protein was determined and steady-state
kinetic analysis was performed.

materials and methods
all reagents were of the highest commercial grade available. h4-pteglu1 was prepared from  xxxd2146xxx  (sigma) by
the standard method of hydrogenation [19] over platinum
oxide and puriwed over deae cellulose [20]. oligonucleotide primers were obtained from integrated dna technologies (coralville, ia).
humito32 cdna construction and subcloning
a 5⬘ primer (5⬘-tataggatccatgagcagcggc
ggc-3⬘) was designed to engineer in a bamhi site and
start codon (underlined), and to begin amplifying at the
codon for amino acid 32. the 3⬘ primer (5⬘-ggagagcc
acacccaaccttcccc-3⬘) was created to anneal
downstream of the unique avrii site located at base pair
803 of the humito1 cdna, previously referred to as
pcdna3.1-humito [16]. a separate construct that encodes
human mitochondrial  xxxg1473xxx  beginning at
amino acid 60 (humito60) was also utilized in the construction of humito32. pcr was performed in a dna thermal
cycler (perkin–elmer). the humito1 cdna was used as a
template for this pcr. ampliwcation was performed using
kod hot start dna polymerase kit (novagen), which
contained the kod high wdelity dna polymerase, dntps,
and buvers necessary for the reaction. humito60 and the
pcr product were doubly digested with bamhi and avrii.
the digested pcr product was ligated into humito60 using
the fast-link dna ligation kit (epicentre) to form the
pvt-humito32 construct. pvt-humito32 was transformed
into ca+2 competent e. coli xl1-b cells (stratagene). the
humito32 cdna was subcloned into the pmal-c2x h10
tev vector [obtained from the laboratory of dr. john tesmer [21]]. the humito32 cdna insert was released from
pvt-humito32 by digestion with bamhi and xhoi, and
ligated into the bamhi and sali sites of pmal-c2x h10
tev. the sequence of the complete open reading frame of
this wnal construct, mbp:humito32, was conwrmed by the
dna analysis facility of the university of texas at
austin.
human mitochondrial  xxxg1473xxx  expression and
puriwcation
human mitochondrial  xxxg1473xxx  was expressed
as a fusion protein with maltose binding protein
(mbp:humito32) in e. coli strain rosetta 2(de3)plyss
(novagen). cells were grown to an a600 of 0.4 at 37 °c in
luria broth supplemented with 0.2% glucose, and ampicillin (50 g/ml) and chloramphenicol (30 g/ml). the culture was allowed to equilibrate to 15 °c for 10 min. the
cells were then induced with 50 m iptg at 15 °c for 4 h.
mbp:humito32 was puriwed using talon metal aynity
resin co+2 sepharose beads (clontech). the puriwcation
buver consisted of 25 mm tris–so4, 100 mm kcl, 5 mm  xxxd26xxx , 20% glycerol, and 10 mm imidazole at a

wnal ph of 7.5. lysis buver consisted of puriwcation buver
supplemented with mini-complete edta-free protease
inhibitor cocktail (roche), pmsf (2.5 mm), tpck
(0.5 mm), and  xxxd302xxx -hcl (5 mm). all wash buvers
were composed of puriwcation buver supplemented with
pmsf (1 mm), tpck (0.2 mm), and  xxxd302xxx –hcl
(2 mm). elution buver was composed of 150 mm imidazole, 25 mm tris–so4, 100 mm kcl, 5 mm - xxxd26xxx , and 20% glycerol. all buvers were at a wnal ph
of 7.5.
puriwcation was accomplished by using a batch/gravity
procedure as follows. rosetta 2(de3)plyss cells containing expressed mbp:humito32 fusion protein were lysed by
sonication, and the lysate was clariwed by centrifugation at
20,000g for 30 min at 4 °c. co+2 sepharose beads (5 ml)
were equilibrated in puriwcation buver by two cycles of
centrifugation at 700g followed by removing the supernatant and resuspending in fresh puriwcation buver. clariwed
lysate was added to the beads and gently shaken at 4 °c for
20 min. co+2 sepharose beads were centrifuged at 700g for
5 min and the supernatant was taken as the unbound fraction. two washes were done, using 50 ml of wash buver, by
gently shaking the beads for 10 min at 4 °c and removing
the wash fraction by centrifugation at 700g. after the second wash, the co+2 sepharose beads were loaded into a
10 £ 1.5 cm column. the co+2 sepharose beads were
washed a third time with 50 ml wash buver at a xow rate
of 0.5–1 ml/min. fusion protein was eluted in 15 ml and
protein concentration was determined by the bradford
assay using bsa as a standard [22].
the mbp tag was cleaved during dialysis against 25 mm
tris–so4, 100 mm kcl, 5 mm - xxxd26xxx , 20%
glycerol at a wnal ph of 7.5. recombinant his-tagged tev
protease (see below) was added to the pooled mbp:humito32 in a ratio of 1:10 (w/w) and dialyzed for 5 h at room
temperature. untagged human mitochondrial  xxxg1473xxx  was obtained by running the dialysis/cleavage reaction over 1 ml of co+2 sepharose beads and collecting the
xow-through. the pooled human mitochondrial c1-thf
synthase was then dialyzed at 4 °c overnight against 25 mm
tris–so4, 100 mm kcl, 5 mm - xxxd26xxx , 50%
glycerol at a wnal ph of 7.5, and stored at -20 °c. n-terminal sequencing of the puriwed human mitochondrial c1thf synthase was performed at the university of texas at
austin protein sequencing facility.
tev protease expression and puriwcation
tev protease was expressed from plasmid prk793
[obtained from the laboratory of dr. john tesmer [23,24] in
rosetta 2(de3)plyss e. coli cells. cells were grown in
luria broth containing 0.2% glucose, ampicillin (50 g/ml),
and chloramphenicol (30 g/ml) to a600 of 0.4–0.6 and
induced overnight with 50 m iptg at room temperature.
tev protease was puriwed by the batch/gravity method
previously described for human mitochondrial c1-thf
synthase with modiwcations. the puriwcation buver

a.s. walkup, d.r. appling / archives of biochemistry and biophysics 442 (2005) 196–205

consisted of 25 mm tris–so4 (ph 7.5), 100 mm nacl,
5 mm - xxxd26xxx , 10% glycerol, and 20 mm imidazole. lysis buver consisted of puriwcation buver and minicomplete edta-free protease inhibitor cocktail and 1 mm
pmsf. wash buvers consisted of puriwcation buver and
1 mm pmsf. the elution buver was composed of puriwcation buver with 250 mm imidazole. immediately after elution, tev protease was frozen in aliquots at ¡70 °c.
gel wltration
gel wltration was performed using the biosep-secs3000 (300 £ 7.8 mm) analytical size exclusion column
(phenomenex) attached to a system gold hplc (beckman-coulter). the column was equilibrated in 100 mm
sodium phosphate (ph 6.8), and each run was performed at
a xow rate of 0.5 ml/min. protein standards used were
 xxxg569xxx  (14 kda), myoglobin (17 kda), carbonic
anhydrase (29 kda), conalbumin (77 kda), aldolase
(157 kda), and -amylase (224 kda). protein standards
were mixed in pairs to a wnal concentration of 2.5 mg/ml
each, and 20 l of each mixture was loaded onto the column, so that all standards were analyzed in three separate
runs. twenty microliters of human mitochondrial c1-thf
synthase (0.8 mg/ml) was run following the protein standards. protein elution was detected at 280 nm.
crosslinking
chemical crosslinking of human mitochondrial c1-thf
synthase was performed using dimethyl suberimidate
(pierce) [25]. puriwed human mitochondrial  xxxg1473xxx  was dialyzed into 0.2 m triethanolamine (ph 8.5),
100 mm nacl, 5 mm - xxxd26xxx , and 20% glycerol.
in a wnal reaction volume of 100 l, human mitochondrial
 xxxg1473xxx , at a wnal concentration of 0.5, 0.25, or
0.1 mg/ml, was treated with dimethyl suberimidate at a
wnal concentration of 2.5 mg/ml. reactions were carried
out for 3 h at room temperature. analysis of crosslinking
was performed using continuous sds–page with a composition of 3.5% acrylamide and 0.0945% bisacrylamide.
the running buver, as well as the buver used to make the
gels, was 0.1 m borate, 0.1 m sodium acetate, 0.1% sds (ph
8.5). gels were run  xxxd1891xxx  ma for 3 h then stained with 0.05%
coomassie brilliant blue in 25% isopropanol/10% acetic
acid for 1 h. the gel was destained in 25% isopropanol/10%
acetic acid.
tetrahydropteroylpolyglutamate preparation
(6r,s)-h4-pteglu3 and (6r,s)-h4-pteglu5 were prepared from the corresponding pteglun (schircks laboratories, jona switzerland) by a modiwcation of the nabh4
reduction described by yeo and wagner [26] using
pb(no3)2 as a water-soluble catalyst [27]. pteglun
(40 moles) was dissolved in 200 l of pb(no3)2
(0.265 mm) by microliter additions of 5 n naoh to

199

increase the ph to 7.5, along with extensive vortexing. this
was done at room temperature in the light. constant measurement of ph in such small volumes was achieved by
spotting small volumes (0.5 l) onto ph paper. the reaction mixture was cooled down to 4 °c and stirred rapidly.
nabh4 (0.2 mg/l) was added in 5 l aliquots for a total
of 25 l over a duration of 20 min.  xxxd1710xxx  (20% w/v)
was used to keep the reaction at ph 8–8.5. the reaction was
moved to room temperature, xushed with n2, and stirred as
rapidly as possible in the dark for 2 h. after the reduction,
the reaction was cooled to 4 °c and any unreacted nabh4
was destroyed by lowering the ph to 5 with 5 n acetic acid.
naoh (5 n) was used to bring the ph back up to 7.5 and
an absorbance spectrum of a 10¡4 dilution was taken. the
(6r,s)-h4-pteglun product showed a characteristic max at
300 nm. the reduced substrate was stored under nitrogen in
the dark at 4 °c.
10-formyl-thf synthetase assay
the 10-formyl-thf synthetase assay is an endpoint
assay that measures the ability to form 10-formyl-thf
from thf, atp, and formate [28]. kinetic constants were
obtained using (6r,s)-h4-pteglu1, (6r,s)-h4-pteglu3, and
(6r,s)-h4-pteglu5. when using (6r,s)-h4-pteglu1, slope
and intercept replots were performed to determine the
kinetic constants for atp, formate, and (6r,s)-h4-pteglu1
because saturating concentrations of (6r,s)-h4-pteglu1
could not be obtained. the reaction cocktail contained
25 mm tris–so4, 100 mm kcl, 10 mm  xxxd2534xxx , and either
saturating levels of atp (5 mm) or formate (200 mm).
fixed concentrations of 1, 1.5, 2, and 3 mm (6r,s)-h4-pteglu1 were used. atp concentrations were varied from 0.025
to 2 mm, and formate concentrations were varied from 25
to 400 mm at each (6r,s)-h4-pteglu1 concentration. reaction cocktail (350 l) and 50 l of diluted enzyme were
mixed and incubated at 30 °c for 1–2 min before the reaction was initiated with the addition of 100 l of (6r,s)-h4pteglu1. the reactions were allowed to proceed at 30 °c for
5 min before quenching with 0.5 ml of 0.48 m hcl. after
quenching, reactions were incubated for 5 min at room temperature to convert all 10-formyl-thf to 5,10-methenylthf, which was then quantiwed by absorbance at 350 nm
on a hewlett packard diode array spectrophotometer.
when using (6r,s)-h4-pteglu3 and (6r,s)-h4-pteglu5,
the enzyme could be saturated with thf and traditional
substrate–velocity series were performed. the reaction
cocktail contained 25 mm tris–so4, 100 mm kcl, 10 mm
 xxxd2534xxx , and the saturating concentration used for each
substrate was 30 mm formate, 5 mm atp, and 200 m
(6r,s)-h4-pteglu3/5. when using (6r,s)-h4-pteglu3, atp
was varied from 0.01 to 1 mm and formate was varied from
0.05 to 30 mm. when using (6r,s)-h4-pteglu5, atp was
varied from 5 to 500 m and formate was varied from 0.025
to 5 mm. atp and formate series were run at 30 °c for
5 min. time and temperature modiwcations of the assay
were made when performing the (6r,s)-h4-pteglu3/5 series.

reactions were allowed to proceed for 1 min at room temperature before quenching with hcl (0.48 m, 0.5 ml).
(6r,s)-h4-pteglu3 was varied from 10 to 100 m, and
(6r,s)-h4-pteglu5 was varied from 5 to 70 m. following
the addition of hcl, reactions were allowed to incubate for
5 min at room temperature to convert 10-formyl-thf to
5,10-methenyl-thf and quantiwed at 350 nm.
5,10-methylene-thf dehydrogenase and 5,10-methenylthf cyclohydrolase assays
5,10-methylene-thf dehydrogenase activity was determined by an endpoint assay [29,30]. the basic reaction
cocktail consisted of 50 mm hepes (ph 7.5), 100 mm kcl,
and a variety of diverent cofactors were tested in diverent
combinations including nad+ (0.5 mm), nadp+
(0.5 mm), and fad (50 m). mgcl2 (5 mm) and potassium
phosphate (25 mm, ph 7.4) were also included in some of
the assay reaction cocktails. reaction cocktail (400 l),
including cofactors, and 50 l of recombinant human
mitochondrial  xxxg1473xxx  were mixed and incubated
at 30° for 1 min. the reaction was initiated with the addition of (6r,s)-5,10-methylene-thf (50 l) and incubated
at 30 °c for 5 or 10 min. final assay concentrations of
1 mm (6r,s)-5,10-methylene-h4-pteglu1, or 0.1 mm (6r,s)
-5,10-methylene-h4-pteglu3/5 were used. the reaction was
quenched with 0.48 m hcl (0.5 ml), and incubated at room
temperature for 5 min. the amount of 5,10-methenyl-thf
produced was measured at 350 nm. 5,10-methenyl-thf
cyclohydrolase activity was assayed by the continuous
assay method of rabinowitz [31].

gel wltration

humito32 cdna encodes the mature form of human
mitochondrial  xxxg1473xxx  that occurs in vivo after
processing the mitochondrial leader sequence [17]. human
mitochondrial  xxxg1473xxx  was expressed and puriwed as a fusion protein with mbp (fig. 2, lane 1), which
serves to greatly increase the solubility of the overexpressed protein [32]. expression at 15 °c allowed for
higher 10-formyl-thf synthetase activity, presumably due
to better protein folding, as compared to expression
attempts at 30 °c. 1–2 mg of fusion protein could be
obtained from 1 l culture, and 0.5 mg of human mitochondrial  xxxg1473xxx  could be recovered after tev cleavage and removal of mbp and tev protease. the co+2
sepharose resin was chosen over traditional ni+2 resins
because it produced less contamination due to non-speciwc
protein binding. the tev protease cleavage reaction was
done at room temperature because the human mitochondrial  xxxg1473xxx  precipitates when treated at 4°.
complete cleavage, as determined by sds–page analysis
(fig. 2, lane 2), was accomplished in 5 h. the wnal puriwed

an analytical size exclusion column was utilized to
determine the native molecular weight of human mitochondrial  xxxg1473xxx  (fig. 3). the elution volume of
human mitochondrial  xxxg1473xxx  corresponded to a
molecular weight of 143 kda, falling between the calculated
molecular weights of 204 and 102 kda for the dimer and
monomer, respectively. also observed in the chromatogram
(data not shown) were some high molecular weight aggregates that eluted in the void volume. human mitochondrial
 xxxg1473xxx  is stored in 50% glycerol, and other c1thf synthases have been known to aggregate in the
absence of glycerol. during the course of the gel wltration
run, a glycerol gradient is created due to the absence of
glycerol in the running buver. since 143 kda falls between
the expected molecular weight of the monomer and dimer
forms of human mitochondrial  xxxg1473xxx , and due
to the fact that glycerol may be required to keep the protein
from aggregating, another means to determine the oligomeric structure was investigated.

crosslinking
crosslinking experiments were performed to unambiguously determine whether human mitochondrial c1-thf
synthase is a monomer or dimer. recombinant human
mitochondrial  xxxg1473xxx  was dialyzed into a triethanolamine buver (ph8.5) containing kcl, glycerol, and  xxxd26xxx . the chemical crosslinker dimethyl suberimidate, which reacts with primary amines, was used at a
wnal concentration of 2.5 mg/ml. crosslinking reactions
were analyzed on a 3.5% continuous sds–page using a
borate/acetate/sds buvering system. three diverent concentrations of human mitochondrial  xxxg1473xxx 
spanning a 5-fold range were crosslinked. fig. 4 shows the
continuous sds–page analysis of the crosslinking reactions. treatment with the dimethyl suberimidate (lanes 2–4)
resulted in the formation of a new band corresponding to

5,10-methylene-thf dehydrogenase activity was tested
with a number of diverent combinations of cofactors
(table 1). 5,10-methylene-thf dehydrogenase activity was
not observed under any of these conditions. 5,10-methenylthf cyclohydrolase activity of human mitochondrial
 xxxg1473xxx  was evaluated using (6r,s)-5,10-methenyl-h4-pteglu1. human mitochondrial  xxxg1473xxx 
did not show the presence of 5,10-methenyl-thf cyclohydrolase activity (data not shown).
10-formyl-thf synthetase activity dependence on formate
salts
it has been shown that activity of the cytosolic c1-thf
synthase from s. cerevisiae is dependent on the cationic salt
formed during preparation of formate [33]. it was of interest to determine if the human mitochondrial  xxxg1473xxx  also showed a dependence on the formate salt.
formate, prepared by titration to ph 7.5 with koh,
naoh, or nh4oh, was varied from 100 to 500 mm wnal
assay concentration. fig. 5 shows the 10-formyl-thf synthetase activity of human mitochondrial  xxxg1473xxx 
in the presence of diverent formate counter ions. an
increase in activity can be seen in the k-formate series from
100 to 200 mm, but a steady decline in activity from 200 to
500 mm. nh4-formate shows the highest activity at
100 mm, but a great decrease in activity is observed as the
concentration of nh4-formate is increased to 500 mm. naformate results in the most stable 10-formyl-thf synthetase activity over the range of 100–500 mm, as there is not a
signiwcant increase or decrease throughout this concentration range. in subsequent kinetic analyses, na-formate was
used.

fig. 5. evect of formate counterion on 10-formyl-thf synthetase activity
of human mitochondrial  xxxg1473xxx . the enzyme was assayed in
the presence of varying concentrations of k-formate (䊏), na-formate (䉱)
or nh4-formate (䉲) in a reaction containing 2 mm (6r,s)-h4-pteglu1,
5 mm atp, and 10 mm  xxxd2531xxx .

was performed using (6r,s)-h4-pteglu1, (6r,s)-h4-pteglu3, and (6r,s)-h4-pteglu5. an inherent problem in
kinetic analysis using (6r,s)-h4-pteglu1 is that high concentrations are diycult to prepare, and this results in the
inability to saturate the enzyme with (6r,s)-h4-pteglu1. to
circumvent the problem of having two substrates in nonsaturating conditions, slope and intercept replots were used
to obtain kinetic constants [34]. atp and formate series
were run at four wxed concentrations of (6r,s)-h4-pteglu1.
from each of the resulting substrate–velocity plots, an
apparent vmax for the reaction and an apparent km for the
substrate being varied (atp or formate) can be obtained by
nonlinear regression. an intercept replot (1/apparent vmax
versus 1/[(6r,s)-h4-pteglu1]) allows for the calculation of
vmax for the reaction at inwnite h4-pteglu1 and the km for
(6r,s)-h4-pteglu1. a slope replot (apparent km/vmax versus 1/[(6r,s)-h4-pteglu1]) allows for the calculation of km
for the varied substrate at inwnite (6r,s)-h4-pteglu1.
since the 10-formyl-thf synthetase assay used is an
end-point assay, it was veriwed that product formation was
linearly dependent upon time at the lowest substrate concentrations. four curves for both the atp and the formate
series were produced using 1, 1.5, 2, and 3 mm (6r,s)-h4pteglu1. an apparent km for each substrate and apparent
vmax for the reaction were obtained by non-linear regression curve wtting to the michaelis-menten equation. slope
and intercept replots for the formate series were performed
using (6r,s)-h4-pteglu1 concentration of 1, 1.5, and 3 mm.

the formate slope and intercept replots resulted in a km for
(6r,s)-h4-pteglu1 of 0.48 mm, and a km for formate of
11.8 mm (table 2). the atp intercept replot resulted in a
km for (6r,s)-h4-pteglu1 of 1.19 mm, thus we estimate the
km for the monoglutamate substrate to be something above
500 m. slope and intercept replots to determine vmax and
km for atp, formate, and (6r,s)-h4-pteglu1 were
attempted; however a negative y-intercept was obtained
when determining the km for atp when using the intercept
replot. however, visual inspection of the atp substrate–
velocity curves suggests the atp km exceeds 200 m when
the monoglutamate folate substrate is used.
steady-state kinetic series were performed using (6r,s)h4-pteglu3 and (6r,s)-h4-pteglu5 as the substrate to
determine the evects of polyglutamylation on the km for
each substrate. data from the triglutamate series are shown
in fig. 6; data from the pentaglutamate series were of similar quality. unlike the kinetic analysis using (6r,s)-h4-pteglu1, the enzyme can be saturated with (6r,s)-h4-pteglu3/5
so that it was possible to obtain pseudo wrst-order conditions. the atp and formate series were performed at 30°
for 5 min, and the (6r,s)-h4-pteglu3/5 series were performed at room temperature for 1 min. the time for each
assay was set at the maximal point at which product formation was linearly dependent on time. this variable was
tested independently for each series at the lowest substrate
levels.
the kinetic constants are summarized in table 2. the
(6r,s)-h4-pteglun km dropped from greater than 500 m
for the monoglutamate to 16 m and 3.6 m for the triand pentaglutamates, respectively. the formate km
dropped 27- and 79-fold when (6r,s)-h4-pteglu3 and
(6r,s)-h4-pteglu5 were used in place of (6r,s)-h4-pteglu1. the atp km also decreased when polyglutamylated
folate was used, although we observed no diverence in atp
km between (6r,s)-h4-pteglu3 and (6r,s)-h4-pteglu5. kcat
and kcat/km values were calculated for each (6r,s)-h4-pteglun series. a trend of decreasing kcat values was observed
as polyglutamate chain lengths increased. increasing kcat/
km values with increasing polyglutamate chain-length
indicate that enzyme eyciency increases with the higher
polyglutamate chain length.

sequence identity between the human mitochondrial and
cytoplasmic c1-thf synthases (61% overall) suggests the
proteins share the same overall domain structure, and it
was expected that mitochondrial  xxxg1473xxx  would
possess the same enzyme activities found in the trifunctional cytoplasmic c1-thf synthases. indeed, the human
mitochondrial protein exhibits a typical 10-formyl-thf
synthetase activity. like that of other c1-thf synthases
[35,36], the human mitochondrial 10-formyl-thf synthetase activity is very sensitive to the polyglutamate chain
length of the tetrahydrofolate substrate. the km values
for all three substrates decreased with increasing chain
length. the km for thf decreased at least 100-fold in
going from the mono- to the pentaglutamate. the km values for formate and atp also decreased dramatically (79and 5-fold, respectively). this was also seen with the yeast
cytosolic  xxxg1473xxx  [35]. the kcat values we
observed for the human mitochondrial  xxxg1473xxx 
are much lower than those reported for the yeast cytosolic
 xxxg1473xxx  [33,35] (16 s¡1 vs. 120 s¡1 using (6r,s)h4-pteglu1). reported kcat values for mammalian and
bird c1-thf synthases [3,37] (32–35 s¡1 using (6r,s)-h4pteglu1) are in better agreement with the human mitochondrial  xxxg1473xxx  value. as observed for the
yeast [35] and chicken [37] enzymes, kcat values decreased
as polyglutamate chain lengths increased, probably
rexecting slower product release for the longer chain
lengths. however, because the km values decreased, the
kcat/km values increased with increasing polyglutamate
chain-length. this increased catalytic eyciency with
increasing polyglutamate chain length nicely matches the
longer chain lengths (6–9) typically found in the folate
pools of mammalian mitochondria [38].

the most important observation, in terms of folate
metabolism, is that the human mitochondrial  xxxg1473xxx  appears to be devoid of 5,10-methylene-thf dehydrogenase or 5,10-methenyl-thf cyclohydrolase activities.
nad+ and nadp+ were tested in conjunction with fad
to determine if human mitochondrial  xxxg1473xxx  is a
xavin bound enzyme as has been seen with other folate
enzymes including  xxxg1475xxx , sarcosine dehydrogenase, and
dimethylglycine dehydrogenase [2,39]. the higher polyglutamates (6r,s)-h4-pteglu3/5 were tested to determine if the
enzyme was dependent on the polyglutamate chain length,
as was seen with the 10-formyl-thf synthetase activity.
the bifunctional mitochondrial nad+-dependent 5,10methylene-thf dehydrogenase ( xxxg1474xxx ) is dependent
on  xxxd2531xxx  for activity [40]. this variable was also tested with
the human mitochondrial  xxxg1473xxx . dehydrogenase activity could not be detected under any conditions.
this conwrms our inability to detect increased dehydrogenase activity in extracts of yeast cells overexpressing the
full-length human cdna [16], and lack of nadp-dependent methylene-thf dehydrogenase in mitochondria from
the cell lines studied by christensen et al. [18]. the sequence
identity between the mitochondrial and cytoplasmic c1thf synthases is considerably lower in the n-terminal
domain (33%) than in the c-terminal synthetase domain
(77%) [17]. christensen et al [18] note several residues in the
n-terminal domain that are involved in pyridine dinucleotide binding or are critical for cyclohydrolase function are
substituted in the human mitochondrial  xxxg1473xxx ,
perhaps explaining the loss of dehydrogenase and cyclohydrolase activities in this domain.
the lack of dehydrogenase and cyclohydrolase activity
in the human mitochondrial  xxxg1473xxx  raises the

204

a.s. walkup, d.r. appling / archives of biochemistry and biophysics 442 (2005) 196–205

question as to the function of the n-terminal domain that
typically contains these activities. structural studies on the
dehydrogenase/cyclohydrolase domain of the human cytoplasmic  xxxg1473xxx  suggest that this domain
mediates dimerization. thus, it has been proposed that the
n-terminus of the mitochondrial protein is retained, despite
being catalytically inactive, to serve this dimerization function [18]. gel wltration and crosslinking studies reported
here indicate that human mitochondrial  xxxg1473xxx 
is indeed a homodimer in solution, typical of the trifunctional c1-thf synthases. however, it is important to keep
in mind that the mature mitochondrial  xxxg1473xxx 
retains an »30 amino acid n-terminal extension after processing that is not present in the cytoplasmic isozymes.
nothing is known about the function of this extension. this
extension might alter the tertiary structure of the n-terminal domain, explaining the loss of dehydrogenase and
cyclohydrolase activities. alternatively, this extension
might be involved in speciwc protein-protein interactions or
perhaps anchor the protein to the inner mitochondrial
membrane. we note that while this n-terminal extension is
present in the mammalian mitochondrial c1-thf synthases (human, mouse, rat), it is absent in the s. cerevisiae
mitochondrial  xxxg1473xxx , which possesses the typical dehydrogenase and cyclohydrolase activities.
the lack of methylene-thf dehydrogenase activity in
mammalian mitochondrial  xxxg1473xxx  leaves a gap
in the pathway proposed for mitochondrial one-carbon
metabolism (fig. 1). it has been established using adult rat
liver mitochondria that all the necessary components to
oxidize the third carbon of serine to formate are present
within the mitochondria [14,15]. the n-methyl carbon of
sarcosine [15,41–43] and the second carbon of glycine
(anne tibbetts, personal communication) can also be oxidized to formate by adult rat liver mitochondria. the oxidation of these three substrates, serine, sarcosine, and
glycine, starts with the production of 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate, and in the case of glycine and sarcosine, occurs
exclusively in mitochondria. it has also been shown by
gregory et al. [44] in adult humans that one-carbon units
can xow through the mitochondria, in the direction of 5,10methylene-thf to 10-formyl-thf to formate, and can be
incorporated into methionine. the mitochondrial c1-thf
synthase characterized here has the ability to produce
formate from 10-formyl-thf (reaction 4). what is currently unknown is how 5,10-methylene-thf is converted
to 10-formyl-thf (reactions 2, 3) in adult mammalian
mitochondria. the bifunctional nad-dependent methylene-thf dehydrogenase/methenyl-thf cyclohydrolase
( xxxg1474xxx ) discovered by mackenzie’s group is a mitochondrial enzyme, but has not been detected in adult tissues, and therefore is unlikely to be the missing link
between 5,10-methylene-thf and 10-formyl-thf. the
human genome contains only four sequences with homology to methylene-thf dehydrogenase: the gene for the
mitochondrial  xxxg1473xxx  on chr 6; the gene for
the cytoplasmic  xxxg1473xxx  on chr 14; the gene for

the bifunctional  xxxg1474xxx  on chr 2; and an unexpressed
pseudogene on the x chromosome. we speculate the existence of a distinct mitochondrial 5,10-methylene-thf
dehydrogenase (or oxidase) that does not share sequence
identity with any known 5,10-methylene-thf dehydrogenases. this oxidation is probably not nad- or nadpdependent, since formate production from [3-14c]serine in
intact rat liver mitochondria is unavected by the complex i
inhibitor rotenone, whereas co2 was inhibited [14]. inhibition of co2 production can be explained by the nadpdependence of the 10-formyl-thf dehydrogenase reaction
(fig. 1, reaction 6). reoxidation of nadph produced in
this reaction is coupled to the electron transport chain via
transhydrogenase activity of mitochondria. the oxidation
of 5,10-methylene-thf (fig. 1, reaction 2) also requires an
oxidized electron acceptor that, upon reduction in the reaction, would need to be reoxidized. if this reaction is linked
to electron transport, it must be downstream of complex i,
since formate production is not inhibited by rotenone.
work is currently underway to try to identify the nature of
the enzyme(s) responsible for the oxidation of 5,10-methylene-thf in mammalian mitochondria.
