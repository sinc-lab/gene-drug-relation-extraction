abstract purpose: chemotherapy regimens based on
anthracycline (doxorubicin) are well established in lymphoma therapy. the purpose of this study was to
examine the eﬀects of l-carnitine with a view to reducing
cytotoxic side-eﬀects. methods: 20 patients were scheduled to receive 3 g l-carnitine before each chemotherapy
cycle, followed by 1 g l-carnitine/day during the following 21 days, while 20 patients received a placebo
(randomized controlled trial). the plasma lipid proﬁle
and relative mrna levels of key enzymes of oxidative
metabolism (carnitine acyltransferases) were measured
at three points of time. in addition to the clinical
parameters we used the mrna of white blood cells to
evaluate the toxic eﬀects on cardiomyocytes. results: in
the present study no cardiotoxicity of anthracycline
therapy was detected. carnitine treated patients showed
a rise in plasma carnitine which led to an increase of
relative mrna levels from  xxxg508xxx  (liver isoform of

introduction
for more than two decades anthracycline doxorubicin
(adriamycin, adr) has been a constituent of the most
eﬀective chemotherapeutic strategies (hale and lewis
1994; rabbani et al. 2005) in the treatment of a variety
of malignancies, including lymphoma, leukemia, and
solid tumors. unfortunately the dose-dependent cardiotoxicity of doxorubicin limits its clinical use and
threatens the cardiac function of many patients with
cancer. it has been suggested that doxorubicin may exert
at least part of its eﬀect by inhibiting fatty acid (fa)
oxidation in the heart (sayed-ahmed et al. 2000; yoon
et al. 2003). free  xxxd2154xxx  (ffas) represent the major
source of energy in the normal adult working heart,
whereas inhibition of their metabolism results in the
accumulation of toxic intermediates. one strategy for
the prevention of anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity is
based on the use of l-carnitine (b-hydroxy-c-trimethylaminobutyric acid). carnitine is a compound known for
its function on the transport of long-chain fas into the
mitochondrial matrix, where the fatty acyl group is
metabolized. novel aspects of l-carnitine were recently
summarized (pittner et al. 2005). carnitine acyltransferases, in particular carnitine palmitoyltransferase-1
(cpt1), play a key role in fatty acid oxidation. since
depletion of l-carnitine has been associated with the
inhibition of cpt1 in cardiac tissue after adriamycin

122

treatment, it was speculated that the doxorubicin-induced apoptosis of cardiac myocytes is mediated by
decreased cpt-dependent fatty acid oxidation.
in vitro studies showed that low carnitine levels in the
culture media resulted in the downregulation of cpt1
and  xxxg513xxx  ( xxxg513xxx ). carnitine
administration restored the mrna expression in a dosedependent manner (lohninger et al. 2002). since
depletion of l-carnitine has been associated with the
inhibition of cpt1 in cardiac tissue after adriamycin
treatment, it was speculated that the doxorubicin-induced apoptosis of cardiac myocytes is mediated by
decreased cpt-dependent fatty acid oxidation. inhibition of cpt1 has recently been reported as inducing
programmed cell death in some cell systems (paumen
et al. 1997a, b). this phenomenon was linked to the
generation of ceramide (andrieu-abadie et al. 1999).
in rats adr treatment resulted in the elevation of
total and free plasma carnitine, indicating an impaired
uptake by cells. the most important carrier in carnitine
uptake is the organic cation transporter  xxxg2112xxx . physiologically  xxxg2112xxx  is involved in the intestinal absorption and renal reabsorption of l-carnitine and also plays
a major role in tissue distribution. variations in transport rates and in levels of expressed mrna are also
found in diﬀerent tissues (lamhonwah et al. 2003;
ramsay et al. 2001; xuan et al. 2003).
white blood cells (wbcs) are known to reﬂect
changes in fa metabolism which are known to be
associated with physiologic alterations (choi et al. 2003;
gardner et al. 2005; karlic et al. 2003; nakashima et al.
2004; zeibig et al. 2005). a correlation of simultaneous
diﬀerential gene expression proﬁles in the wbcs and
heart following anthracycline-induced cardiomyopathy
has been shown to exist in the rat, thus suggesting that
blood cells may serve as a surrogate marker for the
heart. treatment resulted in the downregulation of a
number of genes, including the carnitine transporter
 xxxg2112xxx  both in the wbcs and heart (brown et al.
2002). we therefore estimated the relative mrna
amounts of carnitine acyltransferases in the wbcs of
the patients participating in this study.

materials and methods
experimental approach
forty patients with non-hodgkin lymphomas (nhls)
(three cll, two malt-lymphomas, three mantle cell
lymphomas, 16 centroblastic centrocytic lymphomas, 16
high malignant nhl) of a median age of 64 years
(placebo group) and 66 years (carnitine group) were
randomly assigned to the l-carnitine or to the unsupplemented group (n=20 for each group). the subjects
were informed of the possible risks involved in this
study. all subjects gave their informed consent before
participation. the study was approved by the ethics
commission of hanusch hospital.

quality of life was assessed using a standardized
questionnaire (hofmann et al. 1993; tuchler et al. 1992).
a stratiﬁcation based on impairment of cardiac function
(icf) was made.
of the six patients with icf, three were assigned to
the carnitine and three to the placebo group.
patients received an infusion containing 3 g l-carnitine (l-carnitin ‘‘fresenius’’ infusion solution) before each chemotherapy cycle, followed by oral
administration of 1 g l-carnitine (l-carnitin
‘‘fresenius’’, drinking solution)/day during the following 21 days.
chemotherapy consisted of six so-called chop cycles (day 1: cyclophosphamide 750 mg/m2 in 500 ml
nacl, vincristine 1.4 mg/m2, max. 2 mg absolute;
 xxxd1937xxx  50 mg/m2 in 259 ml nacl; days 2–5:
prednisolone 100 mg p.o.). cumulative  xxxd1937xxx 
doses of up to 600 mg/m2 were thus reached in this
study.
fasting morning blood samples were taken before the
ﬁrst chemotherapy, after the third and sixth chop cycle
(=4 months after starting the ﬁrst chemotherapy) and
in the washout phase, 2 months after the last chemotherapy.
the healthy control group consisted of 51 elderly
persons (49 females, 3 males) with normal hematological
parameters. they were residents of two geriatric units.
the mean age of the elderly females was 87.5 years
(range 78–95 years, median 87 years), that of the elderly
males 88.3 years (range 82–93 years, median 90 years).
ten of them (all females) received l-carnitine (2 g carnitine tartrate/day) as a nutritional supplement for
3 months. blood samples were taken during routine
health checkups after informed consent.
blood samples
venous blood samples were collected in plain evacuated
tubes from a forearm vein with minimal stasis after
approximately 10 min of rest in a sitting position. after
separation of cell-free plasma for l-carnitine determination and analysis of the serum lipid proﬁle the
mononuclear cells (wbcs) were enriched by density
gradient centrifugation using a  xxxd3253xxx –hypaque separation medium (density according to fraction index: 1.077)
and washed several times in phosphate buﬀered saline.
aliquots of 1–10 million mononuclear blood cells were
frozen in 4 m gtc (guanidine isothiocyanate) for
preparation of mrna and cdna for subsequent reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (rtpcr).

analysis of mrna expression
all mrna analyses were made from at least one million
wbcs collected in edta tubes. isolation of mrna
and preparation of cdna was carried out applying

123

standard procedures and using commercially available
kits. quantitative rt-pcr assay was carried out using
the lightcyclertm system (roche). dilutions of 200–
2 ng of cdna were used in each assay.
for the quantiﬁcation of  xxxg508xxx , cpt1b,  xxxg513xxx ,
microsomal cpt and  xxxg2112xxx  dilutions of known pcr
products or cloned amplimers (ranging from 1 ng to
10 fg) were included as standards in each assay for
quantitative pcr.
relative mrna levels were evaluated by calculating
the number of copies of the analyzed gene per 100 copies
of  xxxg53xxx , which was expressed at the most constant
levels per amount of cdna (1,000 copies/ng c-dna;
sd ±10) before mobilization and after apheresis. we
thus used  xxxg53xxx  as an internal standard. in order to
facilitate comparison, results were calculated as a percentage of the values for normal wbcs as previously
determined. further details of primers and reaction
conditions are shown in table 1.

chromatographic run the ptv injector was heated from
60c (sample introduction) to 400c to enable determination of the other lipid classes, except phospholipids
(lohninger et al. 1990).
statistics
medians and quartiles were calculated from all data.
diﬀerences between unpaired data were tested for
signiﬁcance by the mann–whitney u-test, between
paired data by the wilcoxon matched-pairs signed
rank test.
as coeﬃcient of correlation kendall’s tau together
with the corresponding signiﬁcance test was calculated.
a p-value of 0.05 (two-sided) was chosen as level of
signiﬁcance. no alpha-correction was applied.

results
analysis of plasma carnitine

clinical parameters in general

perchloric acid extracts of plasma were used for
assaying free carnitine and short-chain  xxxd3156xxx .
the carnitine esters were saponiﬁed and assayed as
free carnitine by a radioenzymatic method (lohninger
et al. 1990), with two modiﬁcations: hepes instead of
tris buﬀer, and  xxxd2684xxx  instead of tetrathionate.

as regards quality of life and quality of health no signiﬁcant diﬀerences were reported at any point of time.
however, a better quality of life was reported in both
groups after therapy than at commencement of treatment. survival time was not signiﬁcantly longer in the
carnitine group, duration of remission was similar in
both the carnitine and placebo group.

analysis of plasma lipids

cardiac parameters

free  xxxd2154xxx , free cholesterol, cholesteryl esters and
triglycerides were determined directly from total lipid
extract by capillary gas chromatography as described
previously. for ffa determination the programmed
temperature vaporizer (ptv) injector was heated from
40c (sample introduction) to 190c. in a second gas

echocardiographic parameters were checked before the
ﬁrst, after the third, before the fourth and after the sixth
chemotherapies. at no point of time were any signiﬁcant
diﬀerences observed in the size of the left ventricle
(lvidd), systolic function (ef) and e/a ratio between
the placebo and carnitine group (table 2).

e/a ratio describes echocardiographic phases of ventricular ﬁlling (cm/s). these have been termed early (e) and late, or atrial (a). the
latter phase is of course dependent upon atrial contraction and is therefore absent in atrial ﬁbrillation. characteristically, when diastolic
dysfunction is present, a larger percentage of the end-diastolic volume is the result of late rather than early ﬁlling. the e/a ratio is thus
reduced in diastolic dysfunction

in addition, there were no changes of single parameters during therapy. it can therefore be assumed that no
cardiac problems had arisen or that these could not be
proved using the above mentioned parameters.
inﬂuence of l-carnitine supplementation on mrna
levels of carnitine acyltransferases
the results of relative mrna levels of carnitine acyltransferases and  xxxg2112xxx  in wbcs were evaluated after
unblinding of the study. figure 1 shows the relative
mrna levels of carnitine acyltransferases and  xxxg2112xxx 
pre-therapy, immediately after the last chemotherapy
(4 months after commencement of therapy) and
2 months later, in the washout phase.
 xxxg508xxx  was signiﬁcantly (p=0.001) stimulated following therapy (at time point 2) in the carnitine group
(fig. 1b). the relative mrna content of  xxxg508xxx  was
then notably higher in the carnitine group than in the
placebo group (p=0.1). after l-carnitine supplementation there was a signiﬁcant correlation between the relative mrna level of  xxxg508xxx  and  xxxg2112xxx  (p=0.04;
tau=0.27).
in our control groups of healthy elderly probands the
subgroup which received carnitine supplementation had
a signiﬁcantly higher  xxxg508xxx  mrna level than the
unsupplemented probands (63% higher as compared
with the control group).
rise of carnitine transporter  xxxg2112xxx  and carnitine
acyltransferases in the washout phase
increased mrna levels 2 months after the last therapy
(in the washout phase) were observed for  xxxg508xxx  in the
placebo group and for cpt1b,  xxxg2112xxx  and  xxxg509xxx  both
in the placebo group and in the carnitine group, but
there were no signiﬁcant diﬀerences or correlations with
other genes. this conﬁrmed our observations from the
control group of healthy elderly people indicating the
relationship between serum carnitine levels and the
mrna levels of  xxxg2112xxx  and the carnitine acyltransferases cpt1b,  xxxg513xxx  and  xxxg509xxx .

rise of plasma carnitine levels and serum triglycerides
in the carnitine group
figure 1c, d shows the plasma carnitine levels and levels
of triglycerides ctgl50 and ctgl54 before and after
therapy. plasma carnitine levels were determined three
times, namely (1) before the ﬁrst chemotherapy, (2) after
the sixth chop cycle (4 months after commencement of
the ﬁrst chemotherapy) and (3) in the washout phase,
2 months after the last chemotherapy. following carnitine therapy at time point (2), levels of free carnitine
(fc) and total carnitine (gc) in plasma were signiﬁcantly higher in the carnitine than in the placebo group
(p<0.001). after therapy levels of short chain acyl
carnitines (ka) were 10.7 lg/ml in the placebo and
18.3 lmol/l in the carnitine group, but this diﬀerence
was not signiﬁcant (p=0.09). after the sixth chemotherapy the level of fc was 36.1 lmol/l in the placebo
and 53.4 lmol/l in the carnitine group, and the level of
gc 46.9 lmol/l in the placebo and 71.7 lmol/l in the
carnitine group. in the washout phase, there were no
signiﬁcant diﬀerences in serum carnitine levels between
the placebo and the carnitine group. following therapy
serum-triglyceride levels were signiﬁcantly higher in the
carnitine as compared to the placebo group (165.6 vs
240.1 mg/dl).
after therapy triglycerides from the groups ctgl50,
ctgl 52 and ctgl54 were signiﬁcantly higher in the
carnitine than in the placebo group. post-therapy differences between the carnitine and placebo group were
24.2 vs 36.3 mg/ml (p=0.03) for ctgl50, 55.1 vs
76.1 mg/ml (p=0.03) for ctgl 52 and 17.8 vs 24.5 mg/
ml (p=0.05) for ctgl54.

carnitine transporter  xxxg2112xxx  are shown for the placebo group (a)
and the carnitine group (b). relative mrna levels of  xxxg508xxx  was
signiﬁcantly increased in the carnitine group (p<0.001). serum
carnitine levels (fc free carnitine, ka short chain acyl carnitines,
gc total carnitine) and two types of triglycerides (ctgl50 and
ctgl54) are shown for the placebo group (c) and the carnitine

levels of free carnitine (fc) and total carnitine (gc) in plasma were

signiﬁcantly higher in the carnitine group as compared to the
placebo group (p<0.001). after therapy, triglycerides, from
groups ctgl50and ctgl54, were signiﬁcantly higher in the
carnitine group as compared to the placebo group. diﬀerences
between carnitine group and placebo group after therapy were 24.2

measured in the carnitine-treated group (fig. 1b, d). at
this point of time both fc and  xxxg508xxx  were signiﬁcantly higher in the carnitine than in placebo group.
while there was a signiﬁcant correlation between fc
and  xxxg508xxx  at the ﬁrst and the second points of time
(p=0.004 and p=0.06, respectively), at the third point

(p=0.3).
we deﬁned those patients in whom serum carnitine
(both ka and gc) and mrna levels of one or more
enzymes had increased by more than 50% as
‘‘responders.’’ the group of ‘‘responders’’ included all
three patients with cll (two of them belonging to the
carnitine group). of the nhl patients 14.3% (ﬁve of 35
patients, four of them from the carnitine group) were
‘‘responders’’, but neither of the two malt (mucosa
associated lymphoid tissue) lymphoma cases—one in the
carnitine group, one in the placebo group—were included in this group.
the above mentioned ‘‘responders’’ included one
person with nhl, in whom, in addition to  xxxg508xxx , the
relative mrna levels of other carnitine acyltransferases
(cpt1b,  xxxg513xxx ,  xxxg509xxx , microsomal cpt) were also
higher. in two nhl cases the mrna level of microsomal cpt had increased in addition to  xxxg508xxx . this
underlines the close link between the serum carnitine
concentration and mrna levels of carnitine acyltransferases in wbcs.

discussion
anthracyclines (doxorubicin) are constituents of many
polychemotherapy regimens as used for the patients with
b-cell nhls who were investigated in the present study.
the cytostatic eﬀect results from intercalation, inhibition of  xxxg2312xxx , inhibition of tyrosine kinases,
generating reactive oxygen species (olson and mushlin
1990; rabbani et al. 2005; singal et al. 1997) and
induction of apoptosis. there is a known cardiotoxicity
for anthracyclines which has been extensively reviewed
(minotti et al. 2004), the cumulative recommended
maximum dose being 600 mg/m2 (lefrak et al. 1973) in
view of the risk for dilatative cardiomyopathy.
in previous studies the protective eﬀect of l-carnitine
in anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity has been demonstrated through histopathologic investigations of
myocardial tissue. a remarkable reduction of mitochondrial lesions has been found to occur following
inhibition of apoptosis under adjuvant l-carnitine therapy (abd-allah et al. 2005; nakamura et al. 2000; paterna et al. 1984). the mitochondria supply most of the
energy necessary for the function and survival of cells.
consequently patients with cardiomyopathy showed an
improved ejection fraction following therapy with lcarnitine (gurlek et al. 2000).
although carnitine is also known to be a radical
scavenger (kraemer et al. 2003), it has been suggested
that l-carnitine does not simply interfere with oxygen
free radical formation (garcia-ruiz et al. 1997; quilletmary et al. 1997). it is well established that adr
inhibits both cpt1 and  xxxg509xxx  activity in a dose-dependent manner (yoon et al. 2003). in fact, cardiac injuries
induced by ischemia (grynberg 2005) or doxorubicin
treatment (mcfalls et al. 1986) are known to be

accompanied by reduced l-carnitine levels in cardiac
myocytes.
furthermore the reduction of l-carnitine is associated with inhibition of cpt1 in cardiac tissue after
adriamycin treatment (abdel-aleem et al. 1997). in vitro
studies have shown that low carnitine levels in the culture media result in the downregulation of cpt1 and
 xxxg513xxx . carnitine administration restored the mrna
expression in a dose-dependent manner (lohninger et al.
2002).
the anti-apoptotic factor bcl-2 is located in the
mitochondrial membrane in close association with cpt1
(paumen et al. 1997a), and l-carnitine is important for
the regulation of apoptotic processes both at the mitochondrial level and at the level of ceramide synthesis and
signaling (mutomba et al. 2000; paumen et al. 1997b).
due to impaired fa oxidation carnitine deﬁciency is
associated with high levels of ffas. in the present study
the levels of ffas were elevated at the beginning of the
study in both the placebo and carnitine group and remained in the upper range throughout the study period.
high levels of ffas are the main cause of insulin
resistance, which, in addition to diminished fa utilization, disturb energy production from glucose in heart
and skeletal muscle (kolovou et al. 2005; mingrone
et al. 1999).
because of pre-existing cardiac problems one patient
had to be omitted from this study. in the remaining
patients no symptoms of cardiotoxicity were observed,
but a higher risk for patients with pre-existing cardiovascular diseases has been reported (anderlini et al.
1995). in our study we observed no inﬂuence of l-carnitine on anthracycline action—e.g., on survival times,
relapse rate and major clinical parameters. this conﬁrms
previous studies indicating that carnitine treatment reverses the dysfunction of fa metabolism in nontumorous tissues of cancer patients without aﬀecting
anti-cancer therapeutic eﬃcacy (cruciani et al. 2004;
peluso et al. 2000; sayed-ahmed et al. 2000).
the results of this study show that increased plasma
carnitine levels following supplementation with l-carnitine induce enzymes of fa metabolism. the initial
concentrations of total plasma carnitine (tc) were in
general at lower average levels (40–55 lmol/l). after
therapy tc values rose above the normal level to
71.7 lmol/l in the carnitine group. also for fc
(53.4 lmol/l) and for short chain acyl carnitine (sa)
(18.3 lmol/l) values were above normal levels in the
carnitine group. there was a signiﬁcant rise in plasma
carnitine levels in the carnitine group but not in the
placebo group. triglyceride levels were higher in the
carnitine group but did not reach the pathologic range.
the eﬀect of l-carnitine on metabolism depends on
the intracellular concentration which is itself dependent
on the activity of  xxxg2112xxx . the most sensitive technique
for analyzing the eﬀect of l-carnitine on cellular metabolism is by analyzing the mrna synthesis of carnitine
acyltransferases which can be activated in cell culture
within a few hours after l-carnitine administration.

based on experience from our previous studies
(karlic et al. 2003), we analyzed the mrna expression
of carnitine acyltransferases and  xxxg2112xxx  by quantitative
rt-pcr (real time pcr) in wbcs. however, it must be
mentioned that the fraction of mononuclear blood cells
used in this study does not include several cell types
present in whole blood samples: neutrophils, basophils,
platelets, reticulocytes and red blood cells.
 xxxg508xxx  was the only gene which could be stimulated
by l-carnitine supplementation both in the patients of
this study and in healthy elderly persons who were used
as controls. our data from human wbcs and rat liver
(karlic et al. 2002) were conﬁrmed by recent studies that
show an improved activity of mitochondrial enzymes by
carnitine supplementation in skeletal muscle and heart
(kumaran et al. 2004, 2005) and brain (haripriya et al.
2005). recently, a possible concordant regulation of
carnitine associated enzymes after endurance exercise
training in wbcs and muscle has been shown (zeibig
et al. 2005).
this is also documented by the correlation between
concentration of free carnitine and relative mrna levels
of  xxxg508xxx . it appears that free radicals could play a role
in  xxxg2112xxx  expression (brown et al. 2002), and oxidative
stress could be the cause of downregulation of  xxxg2112xxx 
in our patients during therapy. in addition  xxxg2112xxx  is
directly inhibited by a number of xenobiotics, especially
lipophilic organic cations, that is, the antibiotic emetine
and the ion channel blockers quintine and verapamil
(wagner et al. 2000), zwitterionic compounds such as
the b-lactam antibiotics cephaloridine,  xxxd454xxx , ceftazidime and ceﬂuprenam (ganapathy et al. 2000). this
could be the reason for a higher eﬃciency of l-carnitine
as a nutritional supplement found in healthy probands
(karlic and lohninger 2004; karlic et al. 2003).
in conclusion, the results of this study provide evidence that doxorubicin-induced blocking of l-carnitine
uptake may be attenuated by l-carnitine treatment. lcarnitine supplementation can stimulate fa metabolism in wbcs and change the lipid proﬁle of serum.
further studies are necessary to ﬁnd out whether an
additional application of radical scavengers (e.g., bioﬂavonoids and/or  xxxd2494xxx ; al-majed et al. 2002; quiles
et al. 2002) could improve the cytoprotective eﬀect of lcarnitine by protecting the carnitine transporter  xxxg2112xxx 
from radical damage.
