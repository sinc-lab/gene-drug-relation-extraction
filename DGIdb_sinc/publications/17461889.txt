abstract
the objective of this article was to review and summarize the available reports on the
preclinical profile of the novel anticonvulsant drug  xxxd2466xxx  (lev). therefore, a careful search was conducted in the medline database and combined with guidelines from
regulatory agencies, proceedings of professional scientific meetings, and information provided by the manufacturers. this article provides detailed information on the anticonvulsant
effects of lev in various animal models of epilepsy and on its pharmacology in laboratory
animals. the mechanism of action of lev is reviewed, with special regard to its recently
discovered binding site, the synaptic vesicle protein 2a. in general, lev is shown to be a
safe, broad-spectrum anticonvulsant drug with highly beneficial pharmacokinetic properties and a distinct mechanism of action. the clinical studies with lev will be discussed in
the second part of this review article to be published subsequently.

introduction
 xxxd2466xxx  (lev, ucb l059, keppratm ) is the s-enantiomer of alpha-ethyl-2-oxo1-pyrrolidine  xxxd63xxx . this anticonvulsant drug (acd) is structurally related to the
nootropic drug piracetam. it was developed by random screening of various compounds
against epileptiform activity in sound-sensitive mice. despite the fact that the drug was
nearly inactive in either the maximal electroshock (mes) or the pentylenetetrazol (ptz)
seizure test, further preclinical and eventually clinical evaluation was pursued (klitgaard

et al. 1998; klitgaard 2001). findings from these development programs have demonstrated
that lev is a well-tolerated, broad-spectrum acd with therapeutic indications extending to
various types of epilepsy. recently, lev was shown to have a unique mechanism of action
(moa), possibly making it the first of a new class of acds (klitgaard 2001).

pharmacology
anticonvulsant activity in animal models of epilepsy
during early preclinical development, lev was shown to be an orally active, safe,
broad-spectrum anticonvulsant agent in various animal models of epilepsy (gower et al.
1992). lev was effective against audiogenic seizures in mice, providing first-line evidence
for its anticonvulsant properties (gower et al. 1992). lev administration also resulted
in noticeable protection against postural stimulation-induced seizures in epilepsy-prone
mice (de deyn et al. 1992). remarkably, lev has been shown to exhibit little or no
anticonvulsant activity in the mes- and ptz-model, both traditional seizure tests often
used in acd development (gower et al. 1992; löscher and honack 1993; klitgaard et al.
1998). lev did, however, exert a selective action against focal, limbic onset seizures elicited
by high doses of pilocarpine (pilo) and submaximal doses of kainic acid (ka) (klitgaard
et al. 1998). epileptiform activity triggered by these compounds mimics several features
of complex partial seizures in humans (klitgaard et al. 1998; klitgaard 2001). in further
preclinical development, lev has been shown to have potent anticonvulsive effects against
electrically induced partial and secondarily generalized seizures in amygdala-kindled rats.
these findings have been confirmed on many occasions in various kindling models (gower
et al. 1992; klitgaard et al. 1998; löscher and honack 1993, 2000; löscher et al. 1998,
2000; matagne and klitgaard 1998; stratton et al. 2003; de smedt et al. 2005).
results from early preclinical development seemed to suggest that lev was distinct from
other acds by primarily counteracting seizures in models mimicking a chronic epileptic
state, rather than opposing those elicited in acute seizure models (klitgaard et al. 1998;
klitgaard 2001). this view was reinforced by various other studies that corroborated these
findings in chronic epilepsy models.
in the status epilepticus (se)-model, a long-lasting seizure is triggered by electrical or
chemical stimulation, eventually giving rise to spontaneous seizures following a (latent) period of epileptogenesis. seizures in this model are usually partial, with or without secondary
generalization, and are accompanied by distinct pathophysiological aberrations, mimicking
mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (mtle) in humans. in rats showing spontaneous seizures following pilo-induced se, lev significantly reduced seizure frequency during a two-week
treatment period. some tolerance seemed to develop, however, during the second week of
treatment, and the average seizure semiology and duration remained unaltered. interestingly,
the individual response of the rats to lev varied markedly from complete seizure control
to no effect at all, presumably mimicking the therapeutic diversity also found in patients
with epilepsy (glien et al. 2002).
some studies have demonstrated that pretreatment with lev can also reduce or prevent
the development of the initial se. administration of lev before induction of the se with
pilo increased the latency of seizure onset, decreased the incidence of se, and reduced
mortality (oliveira et al. 2005). treatment with lev could also dose-dependently reduce

the development of self-sustaining se following electrical stimulation of the perforant path
at sufficient dose even with a higher efficacy than diazepam ( xxxd1866xxx ) (mazarati et al. 2004).
in general, with an increase in lag time between the induction of the se and the start of
treatment, the seizures are less likely to be terminated (mazarati et al. 2004).
apart from being an effective acd in animal models of mtle, lev has also been
shown to reduce the frequency of both partial and secondarily generalized seizures in the
tetanus toxin model, a chronic animal model of focal neocortical epilepsy (doheny et al.
1997, 2002). several other studies have described the effect of lev in animal models of
primary generalized epilepsy. in sound-sensitive mice and rats, lev was shown to dosedependently reduce wild running as well as tonic–clonic convulsions (gower et al. 1992;
klitgaard et al. 1998). in two genetic models for primary generalized epilepsy, genetic
absence epilepsy rats from strasbourg (gaers) and wag/rij rats, lev reduced the incidence and duration of spike-and-wave discharges (swds) (gower et al. 1995; bouwman
and van rijn 2004). in another study, lev, by long-term once-daily administration, induced
a reduction in epileptiform events in young gaers that outlasted treatment cessation by
four days (dedeurwaerdere et al. 2005). in spontaneously epileptic rats (sers), another genetic model of generalized epilepsy, seizures were inhibited by a series of once-daily lev
injections. furthermore, this significant inhibition of both tonic convulsions and absencelike seizures was detected respectively up to 3 or 8 days after the final injection of lev
(ji-qun et al. 2005). the latter studies seem to demonstrate a prolonged therapeutic effect of
lev, outlasting its normal central nervous system (cns) retention rate in animal models.

antiepileptogenic and neuroprotective properties
in animal models of epilepsy
in general, contemporary epilepsy therapy is mainly symptomatic, mostly aimed at improving the quality of life in patients by suppressing seizures. in recent years, various acds
have also been evaluated for their disease modifying or so-called antiepileptogenic potential.
kindling has been repeatedly proposed as a model to evaluate compounds for their
antiepileptogenic potential (e.g., wada 1974; silver and mcnamara 1991). in one study,
lev was shown to induce potential antiepileptogenic effects in mice, retarding the development of ptz-induced kindling (gower et al. 1992). these results were elaborated further by
löscher, stratton, and their respective colleagues in amygdala-kindled rats. in both studies,
lev administration during kindling acquisition (one hour prior to a once-daily kindling
stimulus) efficiently suppressed kindling progression. when kindling stimulations were
continued after termination of daily lev administration, lev-treated rats were kindled in a
fashion similar to naı̈ve rats that had not been kindled before (löscher et al. 1998; stratton
et al. 2003). interestingly, the discontinuation of lev administration still resulted in a longlasting reduction in electrographic seizure activity compared to vehicle-treated controls.
these authors concluded that lev exerts both acute anticonvulsant as well as long-term
antiepileptogenic effects. what mechanism might be responsible for these effects or how
this could translate into a clinical setting is currently unknown.
further evidence for antiepileptogenic properties came from a study in which lev
was administered over a prolonged period of time before and during the ontogenetic development of generalized seizure activity in sers (yan et al. 2005). sers typically start
with absence-like seizures and tonic convulsions after five and six weeks of age, respec-

tively. the seizures are increasing in frequency for several weeks thereafter until a lifelong
plateau is reached (serikawa et al. 1991). in the study conducted by yan and colleagues
(2005), chronic lev administration to sers during postnatal weeks five to eight resulted
in a significant drop in the mean number and duration of absence-like and tonic seizures
that outlasted treatment cessation by, respectively, three and five weeks. these very prolonged effects are suggested to be due to an antiepileptogenic and not an antiseizure effect of lev (yan et al. 2005). still, the clinical relevance of these results remains to be
demonstrated.
since neurodegeneration is part of the pathology of several forms of epilepsy, many acds
have also been assessed for neuroprotective properties. lev has been shown to induce a
significant degree of neuroprotection in several epilepsy models. in a model of electrically
induced self-sustaining se, lev treatment starting at 15 minutes after onset of established
se did not interrupt the status but provided potent protection against mitochondrial dysfunction (gibbs et al. 2006). although early lev administration counteracted se-induced
alterations in mitochondrial biochemistry without a clear correlation to its anticonvulsant
effects, the same authors recently reported that lev administered at five hours after se
does no longer protect from mitochondrial dysfunction (gibbs and cock 2006). again, the
time lag between the appearance of se and the start of acd therapy seems to be a crucial
factor in limiting neurological damage (gibbs and cock 2006; gibbs et al. 2006).
additional positive results were obtained in the ka-induced se-model. marini and
colleagues clearly showed that in rats, ka increases lipid peroxidation, depletion of endogenous antioxidants, and a marked increase in  xxxg1170xxx  ( xxxg1170xxx ) mrna, facilitating
free radical injury and inflammation. these effects were counteracted by lev at 30 minutes
prior to ka administration, suggesting that the neuroprotective properties of lev might
be partially mediated by stimulation of endogenous protective mechanisms (marini et al.
2004).
finally, lev has also noticeable neuroprotective effects in several stroke and head trauma
models. in a model of focal cerebral ischemia induced by middle cerebral artery occlusion
in rats, lev, by intraperitoneal (i.p.) infusion starting at 30 minutes before the induction of
stroke and continuing for 24 h, significantly reduced infarct volume (hanon and klitgaard
2001). neuroprotective effects of lev were also recently reported in animal models of
closed head injury (chi) and subarachnoid hemorrhage (sah) (wang et al. 2006). a single
intravenous (i.v.) dose of lev improved functional and histological outcome after chi,
while lev, by continuous infusion for three days, improved functional outcome following
sah (wang et al. 2006).
as with antiepileptogenic properties, the neuroprotective effects of lev remain to be
fully demonstrated in a clinical setting.

lev in models of highly drug-resistant epilepsy
despite the fact that several new acds have been approved for clinical use over recent years, almost 30% of patients are considered refractory or drug-resistant. there is
accumulating evidence demonstrating that multidrug transporters located at the level of the
blood-brain barrier, such as p-glycoprotein (pgp) and members of the multidrug resistanceassociated protein (mrp) family, could actively restrict the penetration of acds into the

47

brain (löscher and potschka 2002; sisodiya 2003). one report has shown that inhibition
of these multidrug transporters does not alter the blood-brain barrier penetration of lev in
rats and that lev is not a substrate for these transporters (potschka et al. 2004a).
additionally, lev has been shown to be highly effective in a rat model hallmarked by
severely drug-resistant seizures. phenytoin (pht)-resistant kindled rats do not respond well
to pht therapy (and to various other acds) and represent a model for highly refractory
epilepsy (löscher et al. 1993, 2000). remarkably, lev has been clearly shown to be more
effective in these pht-resistant kindled rats than in pht-responders, while in general,
reference acds are more efficient in pht-responders then in nonresponders (ebert et al.
2000; löscher et al. 2000; reissmuller et al. 2000). interestingly, the area labeled for pgp
expression in the amygdala of pht-resistant rats has been shown to be more than twice
as large as the corresponding area in pht-responders. this indicates that pgp expression
levels in the kindled focus could have a critical impact on the anticonvulsant response to
acds (potschka et al. 2004b). taken together, these findings seem to suggest a potentially
beneficial profile for lev in refractory epilepsy.

mechanism of action
lev has a nongabaergic mechanism of action (moa)
lev seems to be devoid of direct effects on gabaergic neurotransmission, has no
significant affinity for gabaergic or glutamatergic receptors, and does not interact directly with the benzodiazepine (bdz) binding site (gower et al. 1992; noyer et al. 1995;
margineanu and klitgaard 2003). early results already suggested that lev prevented increases in cornu ammoniś 3 (ca3) neuronal excitability by gaba antagonist bicuculline
through a nongabaergic mechanism (margineanu and wülfert 1995). the ca3 area plays
a crucial role in the hippocampal region as being an area where epileptiform bursting can
readily originate (schwartzkroin and prince 1978).
however, several indirect effects of lev on gabaergic neurotransmission have been
reported. lev induced changes in gaba turnover in the striatum, significantly decreasing
spontaneous neuronal activity in the substantia nigra pars reticulata (snpr) (löscher et al.
1996). in addition, lev provided significant seizure protection after focal injection into
the snpr of pilo-treated rats (klitgaard et al. 2003). lev has also been shown to oppose
inhibition of neuronal gaba- and glycine-gated currents by negative allosteric modulators
(e.g., zinc) (poulain and margineanu 2002). in hypothalamic neurons, lev also opposed
the gaba a -receptor blocking action of specific gaba a antagonists, such as bicuculline
methiodide (bmi) (rigo et al. 2002). this finding somewhat contrasts with those of previous
studies on ca3 neurons showing that the hyperexcitability caused by bmi not only involves
gabaergic but also calcium-dependent processes, with only the latter being involved in
the anticonvulsant effects of lev (margineanu and wülfert 1995, 1997).
one study investigated the action of lev on brain amino-acid levels. using microdialysis
in healthy rats, lev was shown to be associated with a significant reduction in taurine levels
in the hippocampus and frontal cortex, while levels of other amino acids, such as aspartate,
gaba, glutamate, glutamine, and glycine, were relatively unaffected (tong and patsalos
2001). taurine has been reported to act as a low affinity agonist for gaba a receptors, to

protect neurons against ka-induced excitotoxicity and to modulate ca2+ homeostasis (el
idrissi et al. 2003). finally, klitgaard and colleagues (2003) showed that in pilo-treated
rats, lev significantly normalized some of the induced biochemical alterations, increasing
aspartate levels and reducing glutamine, gaba, and to a lesser extent glycine levels.

lev modulates ionic currents and displays
potent desynchronizing properties
early on, lev was shown to have no specific effect on neuronal voltage–gated na+
and low-voltage-gated t-type ca2+ currents (zona et al. 2001). lev inhibits the na+ dependent cl− /hco 3 − exchange and lowers neuronal ph i in hippocampal ca3 neurons.
these effects may contribute to its anticonvulsant activity (leniger et al. 2004).
there are several reports indicating that lev also affects k+ - and high-voltage–
activated (hva) ca2+ currents. madeja and colleagues (2003) showed that lev reduces
repetitive action potential generation in neuronal preparations, which is likely due to a
moderate reduction of the k+ -delayed rectifier current. several in vitro studies have
also shown that lev selectively affects the n-type ca2+ -channel and reduces hva
ca2+ -conductance (niespodziany et al. 2001; lukyanetz et al. 2002; costa et al. 2006).
an in vitro study by pisani and colleagues showed that lev can limit the increased
neuronal ca2+ -influx ([ca2+ ] i ) accompanying seizure generation, reducing the fluctuations in membrane excitability occurring during epileptic discharges. the antagonistic
effects of lev on [ca2+ ] i overload might represent one of the main mechanisms behind its anticonvulsant efficacy and could help preserve neuronal viability (pisani et al.
2004).
another interesting study showed that in hippocampal slices, lev significantly delayed
the appearance of spontaneous bursting and ca2+ -dependent hyperexcitability (angehagen
et al. 2003). the inhibition of increased ca2+ -release from intraneuronal storage by
lev might lead to a reduction in excitability, contributing to its anticonvulsant activity
(angehagen et al. 2003). this finding has been corroborated by cataldi and colleagues,
who showed that lev inhibits ca2+ -release from intracellular inositol-trisphosphate (ip 3 )sensitive storage sites (cataldi et al. 2005). ip3-dependent release of ca2+ -ions from intracellular stores is regarded as a major factor responsible for the consistent elevation of
[ca2+ ] i observed in epileptic neurons (e.g., pal et al. 2001).
additionally, several studies point to the fact that, while lev seems to have little effect
on normal neuronal transmission, it has powerful desynchronizing properties in epileptic
neurons. one report showed that under experimental conditions, lev did not alter the components of normal synaptic transmission but selectively inhibited epileptiform bursting induced by bicuculline and n-methyl-d-aspartate (nmda) (birnstiel et al. 1997). margineanu
and colleagues showed that lev, in contrast to reference acds, specifically antagonized
neuronal hypersynchronization in the highly seizure-prone ca3 area of rat hippocampal
slices (margineanu and klitgaard 2000). another report suggested that lev is distinct from
other acds because of its selective effect on collective neuronal responses, rather than on
single neuron activity (niespodziany et al. 2003). interestingly, in neocortical slice preparations taken from patients who underwent resective epilepsy surgery, lev significantly
reduced synchronous epileptiform discharges (gorji et al. 2002).

lev influences expression of several genes implicated in epilepsy
molecular studies indicate that kindling is associated with an upregulation of hippocampal mrna levels of brain-derived  xxxg1614xxx  (bdnf) and  xxxg1590xxx  (npy),
while npy1- and npy5-like receptors are downregulated (ernfors et al. 1991; elmer et al.
1998). one study demonstrated that pretreatment with lev markedly delayed the progression of kindling and prevented these changes in gene expression (husum et al. 2004).
another interesting study identified many genes whose expression was changed throughout kindling epileptogenesis and following lev treatment. gu and colleagues highlighted
the fact that lev treatment normalized to some extent the kindling-induced upregulation
of npy,  xxxg2328xxx  (trh), and  xxxg883xxx  (gfap),
providing an additional basis for lev’s neuroprotective properties (gu et al. 2004).

lev has a distinct moa and novel binding site:
the synaptic vesicle protein 2a
over recent years, several reports have indicated that lev binds to a specific site in the
cns: the synaptic vesicle protein 2a ( xxxg2233xxx ) (noyer et al. 1995; fuks et al. 2003; lynch
et al. 2004; gillard et al. 2006). synaptic vesicles are the key organelles in neurotransmitter
release from nerve cells and seem to represent a previously underappreciated factor in the
neurobiology of epilepsy.
the specific function of the  xxxg2233xxx  proteins and  xxxg2233xxx  is largely unknown. initially, because of its molecular structure,  xxxg2233xxx  was presumed to be a  xxxg2148xxx .
this idea was soon disputed (feany et al. 1992). interesting results were obtained in genetic
knockout mice. indicative of the crucial role of  xxxg2233xxx  in various neuroendocrine systems
are two reports showing that  xxxg2233xxx  knockout mice exhibit limited growth, enhanced cns
excitability (they progressively developed severe seizures), and premature mortality (crowder et al. 1999; janz et al. 1999). despite the development of severe epilepsy in the knockout
mice, no differences were found in neuronal synapse density or synapse morphology and no
major differences in whole brain morphology (crowder et al. 1999). the loss of  xxxg2233xxx  also
did not affect the expression or functioning of postsynaptic receptors, did not change vesicle
stability, and did not alter basic vesicle neurotransmitter loading. these studies seemed to
support the notion that  xxxg2233xxx  was not required for synaptic transmission per se or for the
uptake and storage of neurotransmitters (crowder et al. 1999; janz et al. 1999). rather,
 xxxg2233xxx  seemed to be an important regulator of this traffic.
xu and bajjalieh demonstrated the priming role of  xxxg2233xxx  in neuronal vesicle fusion,
showing that  xxxg2233xxx  is required for neurons to establish a normal quantity of fusioncompetent vesicles. loss of  xxxg2233xxx  modulated the formation of protein complexes required
for progression of the vesicles into a fusion-competent state and, therefore, resulted in a
decrease of the readily releasable pool of vesicles (xu and bajjalieh 2001). these results
have been corroborated by at least one study, providing additional evidence that  xxxg2233xxx 
controls the numbers of vesicles competent for fusion by recruiting from a reserve pool and
interacting with proteins involved in this process (lezzi et al. 2005).  xxxg2233xxx  proteins likely
modulate the formation of soluble  xxxg1610xxx  attachment receptor
(snare)-complexes, proteins that mediate vesicle fusion by bridging between opposed
lipid bilayers (lezzi et al. 2005). another recent study further supports this hypothesis,

showing that stimulus-evoked neurotransmitter release was almost halved in hippocampal neurons lacking  xxxg2233xxx , despite a lack of obvious changes in the number of functional
synapses or in other quantitative measurements. custer and colleagues showed that  xxxg2233xxx 
proteins seem to act as positive modulators of synaptic transmission. the cells lacking  xxxg2233xxx 
proteins showed a drop of 40–50% in the size of the readily releasable pool of secretory
vesicles (custer et al. 2006). in conclusion,  xxxg2233xxx  proteins seem to enhance neurotransmission by increasing the available amount of secretory vesicles and thus release probability,
ensuring correct neurotransmission (custer et al. 2006). how lev would modulate this
crucial biochemical process is unclear at present.

safety
neurotoxicity in rodents, evaluated with an irwin-type observation test, the rotarod test,
and open-field exploration test, was minimal, with only mild sedation being observed at
doses 50–100 times higher than the anticonvulsant doses (gower et al. 1992). this was
also confirmed by another study using open field and standard tests (rotarod, chimney) to
study motor impairment (löscher and honack 1993). interestingly, gower, löscher, and
their respective colleagues reported slight hyperactivity at clinically relevant doses (gower
et al. 1992; löscher and honack 1993). mild sedation and muscle relaxation occurred
only at doses markedly higher than protective doses in rodents, revealing a very wide
safety margin between doses inducing seizure protection and doses inducing acute cns
adverse effects (klitgaard et al. 1998; klitgaard 2001). for instance, the ratio between doses
impairing rotarod performance and doses providing seizure protection in kindled mice and
gaers were roughly 10 and 50 times larger respectively, for lev than for reference acds
(klitgaard et al. 1998). this unusually high safety margin in animal models of both partial
and generalized epilepsy is also supported by recent data showing that lev had no negative
impact on cognitive function in normal and amygdala-kindled rats (lamberty et al. 2000).
reproduction toxicity studies were performed in the mouse, rat, and rabbit to evaluate
the effect of lev on fertility, general reproductive performance, fetal development, and
peri- and postnatal growth (genton and van vleymen 2000).
administration of lev to female rats throughout pregnancy and lactation was associated
with increased incidence of minor fetal skeletal abnormalities, with reduced growth and
with increased behavioral alterations and even mortality in offspring at doses equivalent to
or exceeding the maximum recommended human dose (mrhd) (genton and van vleymen 2000;  xxxd2466xxx  package insert). when pregnant rats were treated during the period of
organogenesis, fetal weights were decreased and the incidence of fetal skeletal aberrations
was increased at a dose equivalent to 12 times the mrhd (genton and van vleymen 2000;
 xxxd2466xxx  package insert). when rats were treated with lev during the end of gestation and
throughout lactation, no abnormal developmental or maternal effects were seen at doses up
to six times the mrhd (genton and van vleymen 2000;  xxxd2466xxx  package insert). therapeutic dosages of lev appeared to be reasonably safe (genton and van vleymen 2000;
 xxxd2466xxx  package insert).
in another study, administration of similarly high doses of lev or its major metabolites
to pregnant mice increased the overall frequency of fetal skeletal abnormalities (malformed
or missing ribs, sternebrae, and phalanges) and of fetal mortality, along with a decrease
in fetal weight (isoherranen et al. 2003). the authors concluded that lev and its major

cns drug reviews, vol. 13, no. 1, 2007

51

metabolite in humans appeared to be significantly safer than other first-generation acds
for use during pregnancy, but indicate that data from animal models should not be readily
extrapolated to a clinical situation (isoherranen et al. 2003). another animal study indicated
that lev does not induce apoptosis and neurodegeneration in the developing rat brain (0 to
21 days old) at therapeutic doses, which is in contrast to several reference acds (bittigau
et al. 2002; manthey et al. 2005).

animal pharmacokinetics
lev is highly water soluble and has a low molecular weight. therefore, high absorption
rates and low interspecies differences were expected and confirmed in mice, rats, rabbits,
and dogs (benedetti et al. 2004). analyses of plasma levels following lev administration
revealed a fast absorption rate and low metabolization, leading to a high concentration of
unchanged drug in the blood with peak times ranging from 30 minutes after treatment in
mice to three hours in male dogs (benedetti et al. 2004). these findings confirmed the
previous report by doheny and colleagues who showed that plasma levels of lev rise
linearly and dose-dependently, with mean peak levels at 0.25 h to 0.5 h in rats and then
decline exponentially. the elimination half-life of lev is usually very short, ranging from
1.3 h in male mice to 3.1 h in male dogs. lev is excreted mostly unchanged through the
urinary pathway (doheny et al. 1997; benedetti et al. 2004).
using microdialyses in rats, tong and patsalos have shown that lev readily enters the
brain without regional specificity but has a prolonged efflux from and slow equilibration
within the brain (tong and patsalos 2001). in rats, lev efflux from the brain extracellular
fluid shows a half-life approximately 50% longer than that observed in the blood. transport
of lev across the blood brain–barrier occurs rapidly and is not rate limiting over various
concentrations (doheny et al. 1997; tong and patsalos, 2001). although lev brain levels
are in general lower than the blood levels, they seem higher than expected based on the
blood content of the brain, and there are some indications for accumulation of lev in the
brain (benedetti et al. 2004).
one important requirement in epilepsy therapy is sustaining the anticonvulsant effect of
acds during chronic therapy. a few reports indicate that some functional tolerance seems to
develop during prolonged periods of lev administration to rats (glien et al. 2002; löscher
and honack 2000). remarkably, unidirectional cross-tolerance has also been reported from
lev to carbamazepine (cbz), but not the other way around (zhang et al. 2003). the clinical
equivalence of lev tolerance has not been shown in patients.

drug interactions in animals
pharmacokinetic interactions between drugs can affect plasma levels of either drug
because of changes in absorption, metabolism, or excretion. pharmacodynamic interactions
lead to changes in the effects of either drug without affecting their plasma levels (patsalos
and perucca 2003).
although lev has been reported to have little pharmacokinetic interactions, there are
several reports indicating pharmacodynamic interactions between lev and other acds

cns drug reviews, vol. 13, no. 1, 2007

t. de smedt et al.

in animal models of epilepsy. in general, lev seems synergistic (supra-additive) with
gabaergic acds (matagne 2001; klitgaard and matagne 2002). in audiogenic mice,
the combination of a low dose of lev with  xxxd3485xxx  (vpa), clonazepam (cnz),
phenobarbital (phb), cbz, or pht produced a marked increase in anticonvulsant potency
by a factor of 28, 23, 16, 4, and 2, respectively. furthermore, plasma and brain levels of
lev and the other acds were not modified during co-administration (matagne 2001). in
amygdala-kindled rats, combined administration of a low dose of lev with vpa, cnz,
phb, or cbz produced an increase in anticonvulsant potency by a factor of 3, 4, 4, and 2,
respectively. this increase was even more significant when the acds were combined with
a higher dose of lev (klitgaard and matagne 2002).
combination of lev with a subtherapeutic dose of  xxxd1866xxx  has also been shown to result
in synergistically enhanced anticonvulsant effects in the treatment of se in rats (mazarati
et al. 2004). additional supra-additive effects have been reported in the ptz- and mes-test
for combinations of lev with tpm and to a lesser extent also with  xxxd2809xxx  (oxz)
and cbz (sills et al. 2004; luszczki et al. 2006). there is also some evidence that in the
rotarod test in mice, lev co-administration can result in the nonbeneficial enhancement
of the acute neurotoxic effects of tpm or cbz, without any changes in the metabolism or
brain/plasma concentrations of the drugs (luszczki et al. 2005).

conclusions
lev is a novel acd with proven efficacy in various animal models of epilepsy. apart
from clearly showing a potent anticonvulsant profile, preclinical reports have provided
increasing evidence for neuroprotective and even antiepileptogenic properties. lev might
be the first of a new class of acds, presenting itself with a novel and distinct moa.
preclinical studies suggest lev as a safe and unique addition to the armamentarium of
acds.
