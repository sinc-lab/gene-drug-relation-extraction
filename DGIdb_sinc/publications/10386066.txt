methotrexate (mtx), a potent inhibitor of  xxxg631xxx 
(dhfr), that supplanted aminopterin, has enjoyed widespread use as an
anticancer agent, an immunosuppressive agent, and to treat psoriasis and
rheumatoid arthritis. to treat patients with malignancies, mtx is usually
administered in doses that produce some toxicity to bone marrow or the
gastrointestinal tract, in order to exert maximum antitumor effects.  xxxd2462xxx , an antidote for mtx toxicity, when used 24–48 h after mtx allows high
doses of mtx to be administered, with an improvement in the therapeutic
index in the treatment of patients with acute lymphocytic leukemia or
lymphoma [1, 2]. in contrast, treatment of patients with non-neoplastic diseases, e.g. rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis, only requires low-dose intermittent dosing (usually weekly) of this drug, at levels that do not ordinarily
produce toxicity [3, 4]. however, in patients who are elderly or have poor
diets, or with impaired renal function, severe and even fatal toxicity has been
observed, even with these low doses.
the finding that cellular resistance to mtx may occasionally be due to
mutations in the dhfr gene, whose product is the target for mtx, has
prompted studies to utilize these mutant cdnas and other mutations generated in the laboratory, i.e. by mutagenesis or site-directed mutagenesis, for
use in gene therapy approaches with the objective to protect hematopoietic
progenitor cells from mtx and tmtx toxicity.

the advantages of using dhfr mutant cdnas for this purpose are the
extensive use of mtx in the treatment of both neoplastic and non-neoplastic
diseases, a detailed understanding of its mechanism of action and clinical
pharmacology, the relatively small size of the cdna for dhfr (less than
1.1 kb), thus allowing this cdna along with other cdnas to be easily accommodated into retroviral vectors, and the availability of mutant forms of dhfr
that give rise to high levels of resistance to mtx and  xxxd3442xxx  (tmtx),
and yet are catalytically active.
in this manuscript, various mutant forms of dhfr, and retroviral constructs containing these cdnas are described. preclinical studies are reviewed,
and clinical studies in the planning stage are outlined.

mechanism of action of methotrexate and resistance
dhfr catalyzes the reduction of dihydrofolate, a product in the synthesis
of thymidylate to tetrahydrofolate ( xxxd3334xxx ). methylene  xxxd3334xxx , the cofactor for
 xxxg2366xxx  (fig. 1), is then generated via the enzyme  xxxg2069xxx , allowing thymidylate synthesis to continue. mtx and tmtx are
powerful inhibitors of mammalian dhfrs, with ki values in the picomolar
range [4, 5]. studies of acquired resistance to mtx in cell lines, and in murine
tumors propagated in vivo, have shown that overexpression of this enzyme,
due to amplification of the dhfr gene, and impaired uptake, due to decreased
expression or mutations in the reduced folate carrier, are the major changes
in the tumor cell phenotype that enable cells to survive the lethal effects of

this drug [1, 2, 7]. less commonly, mutations in the dhfr that weaken
the binding of mtx to this protein occur in resistant sublines, usually with
overexpression of this dhfr protein, and lead to a high level of resistance
to this drug. in the clinic, limited information is available concerning acquired
resistance mechanisms to mtx. recently leukemia blasts from patients with
acute lymphocytic leukemia that were clinically resistant to mtx were shown
to have impaired uptake of mtx, mainly due to decreased rfc expression,
and less commonly, low-level dhfr gene amplification [7]. thus far, alterations in dhfr leading to decreased mtx binding have not been found in
tumor cells from patients resistant to mtx [7, 8].

variant forms of  xxxg631xxx  that are useful for
gene transfer and protection from methotrexate and
 xxxd3442xxx  toxicity
five different mutations have been described that are associated with cell
lines selected for resistance to mtx (table 1). of interest, all but the g15w
mutant involve active site hydrophobic amino acids, l22 and f31. in a study
using ems mutagenesis and selection with  xxxd3442xxx , the only mutant form
of dhfr generated was also at amino acid 31 (f31s) [9]. the knowledge of
the crystal structure of human dhfr [10], and the amino acids involved in the
binding of substrates and cofactors to this protein, as well as the information
provided by the naturally occurring mutations in dhfr (table 1), have led
several laboratories to generate new mutations by site-directed mutagenesis,
with the goal of generating variants that provide a high level of resistance

[19–23]. mutations at several hydrophobic active-site amino acids have been
generated and explored in detail, in particular l22 and f31, with generation
of variants that have desirable attributes for use in gene transfer, namely a
high level of mtx resistance, good catalytic activity, and intracellular stability
[5, 19–22]. table 2 lists the variants for which data on catalytic activity and
inhibition by mtx and tmtx have led to their use in gene transfer studies.
a large number of other mutations have been generated, but limited information is available on some of these variants, either because of low catalytic
activity or lack of protection against mtx inhibition [23–29]. the l22r
mutant, the first mutant of dhfr described to give rise to mtx resistance
[11, 12], provides a high level of resistance to mtx, and especially tmtx;
however, the catalytic activity of this enzyme is very poor, and multiple copies
are necessary to generate sufficient  xxxd3334xxx  to allow thymidylate synthesis. it is
of interest that this mutant arose in a cell line that first amplified nonmutated
dhfr, then with further selection the mutated and amplified l22r mutant
was found [11]. this mutant has limited value for retroviral transduction of
normal hematopoietic precursors, as only one or two copies are transferred
via this method, and in vivo treatment with mtx or tmtx does not lead
to amplification of normal cells [30, 31]. in our own experience, mice receiving
marrow transduced with a retroviral vector containing the f31s variant and
treated with mtx over a long period of time did not show an increase in
the gene copy number of dhfr in hematopoietic progenitors (cfu-s). in
addition, transfection of human cd34+ cells with a retrovirus containing

use of variants of  xxxg631xxx  in gene transfer

this dhfr cdna after long-term culture in the presence of mtx did not
lead to amplification of the dhfr gene (either endogenous or transfected
cdna). these results are in accord with clinical observations of patients with
psoriasis or rheumatoid arthritis treated with mtx for extended periods in
that resistance to this drug is not observed. both the l22y and the f31
variants have been used for the transduction of mouse marrow progenitors,
as these variants produce a reasonably high level of resistance and also have
good catalytic properties (table 2). more recently, our laboratory has generated
double mutants of dhfr, namely l22y/f31s, l22y/f31g, l22f/31g and
l22f/31s (table 2). these double mutants have kis for mtx and tmtx that
are 5 logs greater than for wt dhfr [22]. although there is some loss of
catalytic activity, if one uses the combination of kinetic parameters as suggested
by blakley [5], ki·(kcat/km) is 4–5 times greater for the double mutants as
compared to the best single mutants. when 3t3 cells were infected with a
retroviral construct to compare the level of resistance generated by the single
mutant f31s to the double mutant l22f/31s, the double mutant provided
greater protection to high levels of mtx.

the mouse as a model for transduction of hematopoietic precursors
mice have been utilized primarily as a model system for purposes of
proving principles and testing new vectors and concepts. two major differences
between the mouse model and humans have emerged that must be considered
in relating these studies to patients. mouse marrow progenitors have proven
relatively easy to transfect, and long-term expression at relatively high levels
are observed, as compared to studies in patients (using mdr cdna). in
addition, mice have high levels of folates and thymidine, and thus inhibitors
of thymidine salvage may be necessary for ablation of early marrow progenitors, when using mtx or inhibitors of  xxxg2366xxx  as selecting
agents.
despite these limitations, studies of transfection of mouse marrow progenitors in vitro, as well as in vivo studies after ex vivo transfections, have provided
guidelines with regard to optimal vector use, optimal variants of dhfr, and
dose schedules of antifolates, that are of value for planning human studies.
larger species, such as dogs and monkeys may be of more value in prediction
of outcomes of gene therapy in patients, but the costs involved, the limited
availability of these species, and limited availability of species-specific cytokines, has hampered the use of these species for preclinical studies. calciumphosphate-mediated gene transfer into mouse bone marrow using genomic
dna from the 3t6 line, where the original arg22 mutation was characterized,

was the first report that such transfer of a mutant dhfr could result in
resistance of the bone marrow to mtx [33]. this genetic transformation of
murine bone marrow cells to mtx resistance was further improved and extended [34]. the next improvement in the field came with the retrovirusmediated gene transfer of the arg22 mutant dhfr cdna into murine bone
marrow cells [35]. the major problem with calcium-phosphate-mediated gene
transfer was the relative inefficiency of the transformation process, while the
retrovirus-mediated gene transfer proved to be far superior in this regard [35].
the first gene transfer of a mutant dhfr cdna using a retroviral vector used
the zipdhfr vector which utilizes the long-terminal repeat of the moloney
leukemia virus as promoter and does not carry any other marker. transduction
of murine bone marrow by coculture of bone marrow cells with virus-producing
cells and subsequent transplantation of transduced marrow led to successful
protection of the recipient marrow from mtx toxicity. the actual infection
of an early stem cell was further demonstrated by serial transplantation of
the marrow to secondary recipients who were also shown to be protected
similarly [35, 36] (fig. 2).
in an effort to pursue the transfer of mtx resistance to bone marrow
cells using better dhfr mutants, we initiated studies using the ser31 human
mutant dhfr cdna as our initial studies indicated that this mutant was
more efficient than the arg22 mutant [37]. the ser31 mutant human dhfr
cdna was cloned into the moloney leukemia virus derived n2a vectors
which carried the neor gene as another selectable marker. the vectors used
were the modified double-copy vectors where the gene of interest is cloned
into the 3ltr of the vector, so that during its cycle the virus will produce a
copy of the inserted gene in the 5ltr as the virus uses the 3ltr as a template
to make the 5ltr in the next cycle [38, 39]. thus the vector ends up with
two copies of the inserted gene, hence the name ‘double-copy vector’. further-

more, the inserted mutant dhfr cdna is placed under the transcriptional
control of various internal promoters in reverse orientation to the ltr promoter. this was done with a view to circumvent the possibility of reduced
transcription off an internal promoter in the same orientation as the viral
ltr promoter. of the five different promoters tested in various cell systems,
it was observed that the sv40 and the human ada promoters were the most
efficient in bone marrow cells [39]. it was therefore reasonable to carry out
comparative studies both in vitro and in vivo with the two promoters and the
two dhfr mutants the arg22 and the ser31 dhfr cdna. it was observed
that the ser31 dhfr cdna was able to protect mice from methotrexate
toxicity, and both secondary and tertiary recipients were also protected, indicating that this protection was due to transduction of an early progenitor or
stem cell [40–42].
direct evidence of gene transfer was obtained by polymerase chain reaction (pcr) amplification of the transfected neor sequences and hybridization
of southern blots with neor specific probes after restriction digestion of
genomic dna obtained from day 12 colony-forming-units-spleen (cfu-s)
colonies. long-term expression of the introduced gene was demonstrated by
serial transplantation from primary to secondary to tertiary murine recipients.

by sequential increases in percentage of mtx resistant colony-forming-unitsgranulocyte macrophage (cfu-gm) colonies from primary to secondary
murine recipients. moreover, direct evidence for the presence of the mutant
dhfr gene was obtained by sequencing the pcr-amplified mutant dhfr
sequences using primers specific for the sv40 promoter and the transferred
dhfr gene. various dose schedules were also employed in order to establish
a more clinically relevant situation. after transduction and bone marrow
transplantation with the mutant dhfr, the recipients were treated with 5
mg of mtx per kilogram body weight for the first week and 10 mg of mtx
per kilogram per week for the next 6 weeks. the control animals all died
within the first 3 weeks while the experimental animals survived the mtx
treatment [40].
in another experimental design, transduced animals were not treated with
mtx for the first 4 weeks after bone marrow transplantation but were then
treated with high-dose mtx (200 mg/kg for 2 weeks and then 400 mg/kg for
the next 6 weeks). this delayed high-dose selection allowed the recipients to
recover completely from the irradiation and bone marrow transplantation
before being subjected to mtx treatment. the 4-week delay allowed selection
with a much larger dose of mtx. the delayed high-dose selection with mtx
resulted in the deaths of all control animals within 4 weeks while more than
80% of experimental animals survived the treatment.
results of studies from quesenberry’s laboratory, as well as our own
(unpubl. observ.), indicate that marrow ablation may not be necessary to
obtain repopulation of marrow with cells transfected ex vivo, if larger numbers
of hematopoietic progenitor cells are transduced [43]. these results raise the
possibility that it may be possible to harvest autologous peripheral blood stem
cells from patients after g-csf treatment, and after infection with retrovirus,
return the marrow to the unirradiated patient and utilize mtx or tmtx to
allow selection and expression of progenitors expressing mutant dhfr (or
any other drug-resistant gene). if successful, even patients with nonneoplastic
disease undergoing long-term treatment with mtx may be candidates for this
approach, allowing safe use of this drug, even with increased doses. it has
been pointed out that gastrointestinal rather than hematologic toxicity may be
dose limiting when patients receive mtx. however, in the posttransplantation
period, this may not be the case, as evidenced by the poor hematologic tolerance
of patients to this drug after receiving an allograft, when this drug is used to
prevent graft-versus-host disease. therefore, if higher doses of mtx are tolerated posttransplantation, after transfection of marrow cells with a mutant
dhfr cdna, this procedure may allow larger doses of mtx to be used
safely in this setting (as an immunosuppressive agent), as well as in other
situations as an antitumor agent, e.g. breast cancer, lymphoma. the safe use

of this drug alone or in combination with another drug whose toxicity is also
diminished by the use of a vector that contains a second cdna that provides
resistance, in particular in lymphoma or breast cancer patients at high risk of
relapse, could provide additional tumor cell kill that may possibly increase
cure rates.

hybrid enzymes containing  xxxg631xxx  fused to
other drug-resistant proteins
although it is possible to express two or even possibly three cdnas
contained in a retroviral vector, using ires sequences that allow translation
of these messages, often the expression of one of these proteins is not optimal
[see sadelain et al., 44; this volume]. a new development based on the knowledge that dhfr gene exists in plasmodia fused to the  xxxg2366xxx 
gene [45], has been the construction of retroviral vectors containing fusion
cdnas, separated by a small spacer oligonucleotide. an l22y dhfr cdna
fused to wt ts cdna has been reported [46], and recently we reported on a
f22l/f31s cdna fused to a human  xxxg400xxx  cdna retroviral
construct [47]. this construct provided resistance to both mtx and cytosine
arabinoside in 3t3 cells and in mouse and human hematopoietic progenitors,
as measured by survival of cfu-gm colonies. a detailed analysis of the
steady-state kinetics of the recombinant fusion protein compared to recombinant dhfr and  xxxg400xxx  enzymes showed that the fusion protein
had properties (km, vmax) similar to the individual proteins; the ki for mtx
was also unchanged, although the fusion protein was a little less sensitive to
tmtx than the recombinant f22/f31s enzyme [47]. recent unpublished
studies from our laboratory show that mice are protected from the combined
toxicity of mtx and  xxxd1790xxx  if marrow is transfected with the
cdna containing the hybrid cdna.

proof of principle: retroviral transduction of marrow cells allows
high-dose chemotherapy posttransplantation, leading to an
improved cure rate
although in principle, the safe use of chemotherapy posttransplantation
after high-dose chemotherapy should lead to improved survival of patients,
it was important to demonstrate this in a model system [48]. mice bearing
the transplanted e0771 breast tumor were treated with lethal doses of cyclophosphamide and rescued from toxicity by administration of bone marrow

transduced with the f31s retroviral construct. animals receiving marrow not
transduced with mutant dhfr cdna died from mtx toxicity, whereas mice
transduced with mutant dhfr cdna containing marrow were able to tolerate
mtx treatment posttransplantation; 44% of the mice had no demonstrable
tumor when sacrificed on day 52. another control group of mice treated with
cyclophosphamide and transplanted but not treated with mtx posttransplantation succumbed to tumor regrowth. these data provide a strong rationale for the use of drug resistance genes to protect marrow from drug toxicity
because the increase in dose tolerated may result in an improved cure rate of
chemosensitive tumors.

are we ready for clinical trials using marrow
dihydrofolate reductases
as pointed out in this review as well as in other chapters in the volume,
recent developments have now encouraged the initiation of clinical trials, using
variants of dhfr for hematopoetic progenitor cell transduction to protect
patients from mtx and tmtx toxicity: (1) variant dhfr cdnas have
been generated that produce a high level of resistance to these antifolates;
(2) retroviral vectors have been developed that appear to be safe from recombination events, and express the cdnas at high levels in cells after transduction;
(3) transfection efficiencies of human cd34+ cells have increased, using higher
titers of virus, repeated exposures to viral supernatants, and fibronectin fragment-coated vessels; (4) and the use of coexpressed green fluorescent protein
or other proteins that allow selection in vitro, may be used to preselect cells
that have been successfully transduced in vitro. major obstacles still to be
overcome are loss of expression of dhfr cdna in vivo, and defective homing
of transduced cells as a consequence of prolonged incubation in vitro [49].
the possibility of obtaining prolonged expression in patients after transduction
with the use of continued mtx or tmtx-selective pressure may overcome
some of these obstacles. lessons from initial trials in patients transduced with
mdr cdna emphasize the need to include a control group (nontransduced)
to compare tolerance of drug treatment; surprisingly, even nonsuccessfully
transduced patients tolerated reasonable doses of paclitaxel in this trial [50].
additionally, it would be useful to extend mouse studies to dogs, with spontaneous tumors (breast, lymphoma osteosarcoma), to obtain further proof of
principle, as patients with these tumor types would be targeted for initial gene
therapy approaches in humans.
