nutritionally available vitamer forms in this family must be
converted to plp. the enzymes that are conventionally involved in the metabolism are an atp dependent pyridoxal
kinase ( xxxg1720xxx ) (3, 4) and a flavin mononucleotide-dependent pyridoxine 5⬘-phosphate (pnp) oxidase ( xxxg1793xxx ) (5, 6).
on the other hand, the preferred degradation route from plp
to 4-pyridoxic acid involves the dephosphorylation of plp by
the phosphatase (7) followed separately by the actions of  xxxg168xxx  and ␤-nicotinamide adenosine dinucleotide-dependent dehydrogenase (8, 9).
the major pathways of  xxxd3049xxx  metabolism have been
established for decades, but little is known of how the concentration of plp is controlled in mammalian tissues. studies on
the homeostasis have shown that there is not a single mechanism. the factors for the regulation of plp may include catabolism of plp by  xxxg1721xxx , activities of  xxxg1720xxx 
and pnp oxidase, degree of protein binding of the synthesized
coenzyme, and transport of the precursors (10, 11). although
pnp oxidase plays a kinetic role in regulating the level of plp
formation (12, 13), plp availability is mainly dependent on
protein binding and phosphatase action (10, 14, 15). thus, the
phosphatase action may be important in the regulation of plp
concentration.
a plp-specific phosphatase has been purified from human
erythrocytes (16). the molecular properties including the molecular weight, ph optimum, substrate specificity, and metal
requirement indicate that the  xxxg1721xxx  distinct from
other known phosphatases. alkaline phosphatase (ec 3.1.3.1)
and acid phosphatase (ec 3.1.3.2) also hydrolyze plp and
pyridoxamine 5⬘-phosphate (pmp), but they have broad substrate specificity for phosphomonoesters (17, 18). alkaline
phosphatase is resistant to fluoride and inhibited by l(⫹)tartrate and levamisole, whereas the plp-specific phosphatase
not. acid phosphatase is not inhibited by fluoride and edta.
the  xxxg1721xxx  is most active at physiological ph and
requires mg2⫹ for activity (19). it is a dimer with a molecular
mass of 64 kda, and has a km value of ⬃1 ␮m for plp, which is
10-fold lower than that reported with other phosphatases (16).
data obtained in chemical modification studies revealed that
 xxxg1721xxx  has essential residues such as cysteine, arginine, histidine, and a carboxylate group at or near the active
site (20 –22).
although the plp-specific phosphatase has been purified
and characterized, a cdna encoding  xxxg1721xxx  has not
yet been identified. here we cloned cdnas encoding  xxxg1721xxx  from human and mouse. in addition, we describe the
high efficiency expression of the protein in escherichia coli
with its kinetic properties and the tissue-specific expression.

 xxxg1721xxx  catalyzes the dephosphorylation of pyridoxal 5ⴕ-phosphate (plp) and pyridoxine
5ⴕ-phosphate. a human brain cdna clone was identified
to the  xxxg1721xxx  on the basis of peptide sequences obtained previously. the cdna predicts a 296amino acid protein with a calculated mr of 31698. the
open reading frame is encoded by two exons located on
human chromosome 22q12.3, and the exon-intron junction contains the gt/ag consensus splice site. in addition, a full-length mouse  xxxg1721xxx  cdna of 1978
bp was also isolated. mouse enzyme encodes a protein of
292 amino acids with mr of 31512, and it is localized on
chromosome 15.e1. human and mouse  xxxg1721xxx 
share 93% identity in protein sequence. a blast search
revealed the existence of putative proteins in organism
ranging from bacteria to mammals. catalytically active
human  xxxg1721xxx  was expressed in escherichia
coli, and characteristics of the recombinant enzyme
were similar to those of erythrocyte enzyme. the recombinant enzyme displayed km and kcat values for pyridoxal of 2.5 ␮m and 1.52 sⴚ1, respectively. human plp
phosphatase mrna is differentially expressed in a tissue-specific manner. a single mrna transcript of 2.1 kb
was detected in all human tissues examined and was
highly abundant in the brain. obtaining the molecular
properties for the human  xxxg1721xxx  may provide
new direction for investigating metabolic pathway involving  xxxd3049xxx .

experimental procedures

initial velocity data were fitted by a least-squares method to the lineweaver-burk transformation of the following equation,

␷ ⫽ vmax 关s兴/共km ⫹ 关s兴兲
where [s] represents the concentration of the varied substrate plp, and
km represents the michaelis constant.
a molecular weight of 64,000 for  xxxg1721xxx  with a specific
activity of 1.4 ␮mol䡠min⫺1mg⫺1 was used in the calculations of molar
enzyme concentrations. one unit of specific activity is defined as the
amount of protein that catalyzes the formation of pyridoxal/min from
plp. plp is known to have an extinction coefficient of 4900 cm⫺1 m⫺1
at ph 7. protein concentrations were determined by the bradford assay
using the reagent and micro procedure from pierce chemical co. bovine
 xxxg124xxx  was used as a standard.
in addition, hydrolysis of all other substrates was measured in 40
mm triethanolamine-hcl, ph 7.4, containing 4 mm mgcl2. the release
of free phosphate from potential substrates was measured colorimetrically as the molybdate complex with malachite green (16, 24).
multiple tissue expression array—a northern filter containing 8
human tissue-specific poly(a)⫹ rnas and a dot blot array containing
human poly(a)⫹ rnas from various adult tissues, fetal tissues, and
cancer cell lines were prehybridized at 65 °c for 1 h in expresshybtm
hybridization solution (clontech). the filters were then hybridized at
65 °c for 16 h with 32p-labeled cdna probe containing the complete
orf. after washing as recommended by the manufacturer, blots were
exposed to x-ray films at ⫺70 °c with an intensifying screen for the
appropriate time period. for scanning densitometry, the blot was
scanned and biolab image software was used to quantify the signals.
blots were reprobed with ␤-actin as a loading control.
results

identification and cloning of the  xxxg1721xxx  cdna
from human and mouse—using two tryptic peptide sequences
from the erythrocytes  xxxg1721xxx  previously reported by
gao and fonda (21), we conducted ncbi blast searches of
the human est data base. a cdna clone encoding both peptide
sequences, designated a hypothetical protein dj37e 16.5 from
lung carcinoma (genbanktm/ebi accession number nm020315)
was identified. when the tryptic peptide sequences were aligned
with the deduced amino acid sequence there was a perfect match,
confirming that the cdna in the est genbanktm data base
codes for  xxxg1721xxx .
we used the sequence information for designing specific
primers for pcr amplification utilizing a human brain cdna
library. sequencing of this clone revealed that the brain cdna
is identical to the hypothetical protein from lung carcinoma.
the orf encodes a 296-amino acid protein with a molecular
mass of 31698 da. a computer calculation reveals that the
isoelectric point for the protein is 6.12. scanprosite software
analysis by expasy showed that the deduced human protein
has the following putative post-translational modification
sites: 2 n-glycosylation sites, 7 phosphorylation sites, and 4
n-myristoylation sites.
in addition, we cloned a complete mouse homologue by 5⬘race and 3⬘-race-pcr using an est sequence (genbanktm/
ebi accession number ak043228). as shown in fig. 1, the
longest cdna contains 1978 bp consisting of a 879-bp orf, a
13-bp 5⬘-untranslated region, and a 1086-bp 3⬘-noncoding region. the 3⬘-end of the sequence contains a poly(a) stretch,
preceded by a putative polyadenylation signal aataaa. the
open reading frame encodes a 292-amino acid protein with a
predicted molecular mass of 31512 da and pi of 5.53. the
deduced protein has a putative n-glycosylation site, 5 phosphorylation sites, and 4 amidation sites.
using blast searches of the est data bases, we found
putative plp phosphatases in various species. multiple alignment of the protein sequence of  xxxg1721xxx  with other
homologous proteins or putative proteins was performed using
the clustalw program as shown in fig. 2. all of the plp

materials—we purchased a human brain cdna library as well as a
dot blot array containing poly(a)⫹ rnas from human tissues from
clontech (palo alto, ca). restriction endonuclease and other cloning
reagents were purchased from new england biolabs, inc. (beverly, ma)
or promega. double-stranded dna probes were radiolabeled with
[␣-32p]dctp (3000 ci/mmol) from amersham biosciences using a commercial random priming kit (amersham biosciences). all other reagentgrade chemicals were obtained from standard suppliers.
identification and cloning of human brain  xxxg1721xxx 
(hplpp) cdna—blast searches, conducted with  xxxg1721xxx 
peptides (aqgvlfdcdgvl and avlvgydehfsfak) as query sequences, revealed a full match with the predicted amino acid sequence
of a cdna (genbanktm/ebi accession number nm020315). this clone
was used to design pcr primers for the cloning of human  xxxg1721xxx  cdna.
we employed 5⬘-rapid amplification of cdna ends (race) using
hplpp-specific primer 1 (5⬘-cgatgctgaagttctccgtgatgcac3⬘),  xxxg1222xxx  anchor primer, and marathon ready cdna (human whole
brain, clontech) as a template. pcr was carried out with betaine in a
geneamp pcr system 2400 (perkinelmer life sciences) for 30 cycles of
denaturation (94 °c, 30 s annealing; 60 °c, 1 min; 72 °c, 2 min extension). the resulting pcr product of 737 bp fragment revealed that the
5⬘-untranslated region is completely matched except 9 bp shorter than
the cdna from lung carcinoma. the full-length open reading frame
(orf) of 891 bp was amplified using the hplpp-specific primers (sense,
5⬘-ggatccggctgcatggcgcgctgcga-3⬘; antisense, 5⬘-ggatccggggtgg gcctgtggctgcag-3⬘). the pcr product was cloned
into the pgem-t vector (promega) and sequenced (genbanktm accession number ay125047).
a multiple protein sequence alignment of the human  xxxg1721xxx  clone, along with the sequences most closely related to it, was
performed using the clustalw (version 1.74) program (23), and the
resulting aligned sequence were shaded using boxshade. identification
of the chromosomal localization of the human  xxxg1721xxx  was
performed by a blastn search of the human genome sequences of the
national center for biotechnology information (ncbi).
cloning of mouse brain  xxxg1721xxx  (mplpp) cdna—we also
identified a mouse expressed sequence tag (est) clone (genbanktm
accession number ak043228) with high similarity to human  xxxg1721xxx . to obtain a full-length cdna corresponding to this est clone,
5⬘-race and 3⬘-race were performed using mouse brain cdna (seegene, seoul, korea) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. two consecutive pcr reactions using ex taq polymerase (takara) were performed as follows: (1) 5⬘-race, 94 °c for 3 min followed by 30 cycles of
94 °c for 1 min and 63 °c for 40 s, followed by primer extension at 72 °c
for 5 min with 5⬘-race primer (5⬘-gtctaccaggcattcgcttcat3⬘) and mplpp-specific primer 1 (5⬘-atcccagcctcccttcact-3⬘);
and (2) 3⬘-race, 94 °c for 3 min followed by 30 cycles of 94 °c for 1 min,
56 °c for 40 s, and primer extension at 72 °c for 5 min with 3⬘-race
primer (5⬘-ctgtgaatgctgcgactacgat-3⬘) and mplpp-specific
primer 2 (5⬘-atggaagggaggctgggatccagg-3⬘). the pcr products were cloned and sequenced.
expression in e. coli and purification of human  xxxg1721xxx —
the  xxxg1721xxx  cdna was cloned between the bamhi of the
bacterial expression vector pqe30 (qiagen) after pcr amplification.
transformants of e. coli m15/prer4 with the resulting pqe30-hplpp
construct were grown at 37 °c in 200 ml of lb medium with 100 ␮g/ml
ampicillin and 25 ␮g/ml kanamycin. the plasmid prep4 constitutively
expresses the lac repressor protein encoded by the laci gene to reduce
the basal level of expression (qiagen). when that culture had grown to
an a600 of 0.6, isopropyl ␤-d-thiogalactopyranoside was added to a final
concentration of 1 mm. after inducing the expression of the  xxxg1721xxx  protein for 16 h at 25 °c cells were harvested, washed, and
resuspended in 20 ml of 20 mm tris-hcl buffer, ph 7.4, containing 200
mm nacl and 20 mm imidazole.
the cell suspension was sonicated, and the lysate was cleared by
centrifugation  xxxd1891xxx ,000 ⫻ g and 4 °c for 30 min. the supernatant was
then poured into the column loaded with the nickel- xxxd2739xxx 
agarose (qiagen), washed with  xxxd3449xxx  containing 40 mm imidazole,
and eluted protein was eluted with 200 mm imidazole. the purity of the
eluted protein was evaluated by 12% sds-page using coomassie blue
staining to visualize the protein.
enzyme assay and kinetic characterization—the enzymatic activity
of  xxxg1721xxx  was measured at ph 7.4 in 40 mm triethanolaminehcl. the rate of production of pyridoxal from plp was measured by
following the decrease in absorbance at 390 nm for at least 3 min. the

codon is marked by an asterisk, and the polyadenylation signal is double underlined. putative glycosylation sites (g), phosphorylation sites (p), and
n-myristoylation sites (m) in mouse  xxxg1721xxx  are indicated. a potential exon/intron junction is also indicated by a slash. the numbers on
the right refer to nucleotide and amino acid positions.

phosphatases are highly homologous at the amino acid sequence level. the mouse  xxxg1721xxx  sequence shows a
high degree of similarity (94% identity and 98% similarity)
with the human enzyme. the sequence identities of human
 xxxg1721xxx  to the hypothetical proteins from danio rerio,
drosophila melanogaster, caenorhabditis elegans, arabidopsis
thaliana, saccharomyces cerevisiae, and e. coli are 36, 28, 26,
25, 31, and 27%, respectively, and similarities share 77, 65, 68,
60, 70, and 66%, respectively. this result suggests that plp
phosphatase is highly homologous and widely expressed

throughout evolution. the tryptic sequences from human
erythrocytes enzyme that are perfectly matched with the deduced amino sequence are indicated by asterisks in fig. 2.
genomic organization and chromosomal localization—using  xxxg1721xxx  cdna as a query sequence, a blast analysis of the
genomic sequence available through ncbi web site mapped
the  xxxg1721xxx  gene to human chromosome 22q12.3.
mouse  xxxg1721xxx  gene is located on chromosome 15.e1
with a very similar genomic organization to that observed in
human. the orf of  xxxg1721xxx  is encoded by two exons

as shown in fig. 3. the intron/exon junctions followed the
gt/ag rule (25) and were flanked by conserved sequences. the
lariate branch-point in the consensus sequence is located at 23
nucleotides upstream of the 3⬘ splice site. the possible exon/
intron junction site in mouse cdna is also indicated by a slash
in fig. 1.
functional expression and catalytic properties of the human recombinant enzyme—after e. coli m15/pqe30-hplpp
was induced with isopropyl ␤-d-thiogalactopyranoside, the
his6-tagged recombinant  xxxg1721xxx  yielded a major
band with an apparent molecular mass of 32 kda on an sdspage gel corresponding to about 15% of the total applied
protein (fig. 4). most of the expressed protein was found in the
soluble extract after lysis of the cells. as shown in table i, the
crude extraction from 200 ml of cells contained ⬃14.5 mg of
total protein and 0.14 units/mg of  xxxg1721xxx  activity.
purification by binding to ni2⫹- xxxd2739xxx -agarose
resin and elution with buffer containing 200 mm imidazole
resulted in a near homogeneous preparation. the purified recombinant protein had a specific activity of 1.4 units/mg and
appeared as a single band with a molecular mass of 32 kda

agreeing with the value calculated from the deduced sequence
(fig. 4, lane 6).
activity of the human  xxxg1721xxx  toward plp, pnp,
and pmp was determined (table ii). recombinant human enzyme followed michaelis-menten kinetics with respect to plp,
and the michaelis constant and kcat value for this reactant was
2.5 ␮m and 1.52 s⫺1, respectively. km for pnp and pmp were 43
and 81 ␮m, respectively, and kcat values were 1.25 and 0.45 s⫺1,
respectively, whereas activity with  xxxd2822xxx 
was very low. thus, the specificity constant of the recombinant
 xxxg1721xxx  was highest with plp followed by pnp. the
recombinant enzyme requires a divalent ion for activity, and
mg⫹2 is the most effective in catalyzing the dephosphorylation
of plp.
to investigate the state of aggregation of recombinant human  xxxg1721xxx , the purified enzyme was examined by
fplc gel filtration at ph 7.4 in 50 mm triethanolamine-hcl
buffer. the elution profile of the enzyme exhibits a symmetrical
peak characterized by a molecular mass of about 60 kda when
the concentration of the recombinant protein in the fraction is
around 10 ␮m (data not shown). these data clearly indicate

that the recombinant enzyme is a dimer, agreeing with previous data for the erythrocyte enzyme.
tissue-specific expression of human  xxxg1721xxx —dot
blot array and northern blot analyses were used to determine
the expression pattern for  xxxg1721xxx  in human tissues.
as evident by multiple tissue expression (mtetm) array analysis,  xxxg1721xxx  transcripts were detected in most tissues, indicating ubiquitous expression. however, the level of
expression was markedly variable.  xxxg1721xxx  was most
highly represented in all the regions of central nerve system
except the spinal cord (fig. 5). the other major sites of expression were found in liver and testis. in fetus, expression levels of
 xxxg1721xxx  transcript showed a rather even distribution
in all organs except brain. like adult, fetal brain expressed
 xxxg1721xxx  transcript with a very high level. to determine the size of mrna transcripts, northern blots analyses
were performed. a single 2.1-kb transcript was detected with
variable intensity in all adult tissues examined: heart, brain,
placenta, lung, liver, skeletal muscle, kidney, and pancreas
(data not shown).

in this report, we describe the first identification and characterization of cdnas encoding a  xxxg1721xxx  from human and mouse. a human cdna clone of  xxxg1721xxx  was
identified by ncbi blast search on the basis of the amino
acid sequences of two peptides from the purified human erythrocytes enzyme. several lines of evidence confirm that the
cdna is indeed encoding the  xxxg1721xxx . first, the
amino acid sequences of the two peptides of the purified protein
are contained in the amino acid sequence deduced from the
orf (fig. 2). second, the molecular mass of the protein of 32
kda calculated from the deduced cdna sequence is identical to
the values from sds-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis for the
purified erythrocyte protein and the recombinant protein.
third, the kinetic parameters of the recombinant protein are
similar to those of purified enzyme. the km values for the
substrate plp (2.5 ␮m) are practically indistinguishable from
those of the erythrocyte (1.5 ␮m) (16).
human  xxxg1721xxx  cdna encodes a 296-amino acid
protein with a predicted molecular mass of 31698 da. the
hydropathy profile of  xxxg1721xxx  indicated a rather even
distribution of hydrophobic and hydrophilic regions throughout
the molecule (data not shown). therefore, no evidence for integral membrane domains in  xxxg1721xxx  was found. the
isolated cdna contains a short 5⬘-untranslated segment similar to lung carcinoma cdna. no larger product has been generated in repeated race experiments using different primer
sets. furthermore, the 2.1-kb message determined by northern
analysis agrees well with the size of the full-length cdna,
suggesting that the 5⬘-end of the cdna is at or near the transcription start site. therefore, the cloned human brain cdna
may be complete. by contrast, analysis the est clone for mouse
 xxxg1721xxx  shows that it was incomplete. the mouse
est sequence (genbanktm/ebi accession number ak043228)
contains several unidentified nucleotides and a stop codon in
orf, but no polyadenylate tail. thus, we cloned a full-length
cdna of mouse  xxxg1721xxx  by 5⬘- and 3⬘-race-pcrs,
and the sequence has been deposited in genbanktm/ebi as
accession number ay366300.
comparison of the identified cdna sequences with the
genome sequences revealed the genomic structure and chromosomal localization. the  xxxg1721xxx  gene is divided

well conserved as shown in fig. 3. in mammals two ends of
the intron are conserved by a donor-site consensus sequence
ag/guragu and an acceptor-site consensus sequence
(y)nncag/g, where r, y, and n indicate purine, pyrimidine,

and any nucleotide, respectively (25, 26). a branch-point consensus sequence, yncugac, is usually about 15– 40 nucleotides upstream of the 3⬘ splice site, and the adenosine in the
sequence forms the 2⬘–5⬘ linkage in the lariat structure. in
addition, the genomic sequences were examined for the pres-

human recombinant  xxxg1721xxx 
selectively present with the highest activity found in liver and
kidney (28).
in conclusion, the results obtained in this study will provide
valuable information on the action mechanism of human plp
phosphatase and the physiological role of this enzyme. the
availability of the cdnas encoding  xxxg1721xxx , and the
recombinant enzyme will be helpful to expand our view of
metabolic pathways that could involve  xxxg1721xxx  and to
evaluate its functional role in human cellular homeostasis.

ence of cpg islands using the cpg plot program in european
bioinformatics institute (ebi), as defined by gardiner-garden
and frommer (27). the hplpp gene contains a cpg island
with a cgobs/cgexp ratio in excess of 0.8 and a gc content of
74% spanning a region from 343-bp upstream to 614-bp downstream of the start codon, whereas the mplpp gene has a cpg
island extending from ⫺282 bp to ⫹643 bp with a cg content
of 71%.
we also reported here the functional expression of human
 xxxg1721xxx . the expressed protein was purified by a
one-step affinity chromatographic method, and consequently
endogenous  xxxg1721xxx  produced by e. coli was eliminated. enzymological analysis of the recombinant human protein expressed from this cdna clone showed a high specificity
for the hydrolysis of plp. characteristics of the recombinant
enzyme were similar to those from the native enzyme purified
from human erythrocytes, except kinetic values for pnp (16).
noteworthy is the relatively high vmax and km with pnp as a
substrate. as shown in table ii, the km values of recombinant
enzyme for pnp and plp were 43 and 2.5 ␮m, respectively,
whereas the vmax values for pnp were surprisingly high as 1.2
units/mg, which is almost same to the value for plp (1.4
units/mg). judging from the kinetic results, the catalytic efficiency (kcat/km) for pnp was 20-fold lower than that of plp. on
the other hand, the kinetic values for the native enzyme were
somewhat different (16). the enzyme had relatively low km and
vmax values with pnp. km values with respect to pnp and plp
were 5.2 and 1.5 ␮m, respectively, whereas the vmax were 3.2
units/mg and 0.7 units/mg, respectively. in consequence, catalytic efficiency value for pnp was 17-fold low than that of plp,
which is practically indistinguishable from that of the recombinant enzyme.
an interesting aspect of our work is the finding that plp
phosphatase is differentially expressed in a tissue-specific
manner. based on the levels of mrna expression, the widespread distribution of  xxxg1721xxx  in human tissues is
consistent with its essential role in cellular metabolism. in
addition to its housekeeping role in plp metabolism, however,
 xxxg1721xxx  may play a more specific role especially in
brain, where its level is substantially higher. in this connection, it is should be noted that  xxxg1720xxx  is expressed in
essentially all mammalian organs (4), whereas pnp oxidase is
