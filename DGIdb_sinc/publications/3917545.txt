inactivation of prostaglandin h synthase and  xxxg1880xxx  by phenylbutazone. requirement for peroxidative metabolism.  phenylbutazone (pb), a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug, is an efficient reducing cofactor for the peroxidase activity of prostaglandin h synthase (phs). most reducing cofactors for the peroxidase protect phs and  xxxg1880xxx  from inactivation by hydroperoxides. pb, however, does not protect these enzymes, but rather augments their hydroperoxide-dependent inactivation. using ram seminal vesicle microsomes as a source of phs and  xxxg1880xxx , we have examined the interaction of pb and exogenous hydroperoxides. chromatographic analysis of the metabolism of 14c-labeled  xxxd208xxx  in this system revealed that pb-dependent inactivation of phs is markedly increased in the presence of 100 microm h2o2. this inactivation is a linear function of pb concentration between 10 and 250 microm, with a half-maximal effect in this range at about 100 microm pb.  xxxg1880xxx  is even more sensitive to inactivation by the combined pb and h2o2 treatment, with a corresponding half-maximal effect at pb concentrations near 25 microm. this pb- and h2o2-dependent inactivation is demonstrable whether pgh2 is generated in situ from  xxxd208xxx  or is added exogenously, supporting a direct effect of the treatment on  xxxg1880xxx . as pb undergoes peroxide-dependent co-oxygenation catalyzed by phs, we propose that it is an oxygenated derivative of pb, rather than the parent compound, which is responsible for the inactivation of phs and  xxxg1880xxx . nafazatrom, a competitive inhibitor of pb co-oxygenation, blocks the effects of the pb and h2o2 treatment, supporting our proposal.
