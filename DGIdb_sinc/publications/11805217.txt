abstract
in an attempt to elaborate in vitro on a therapeutic strategy that
counteracts an inflammatory signal, we previously reported a
novel immunopharmacological potential of glutathione, an antioxidant thiol, in regulating inflammatory cytokines. in the
present study, we investigated the hypothesis that selective
regulation of phosphodiesterases (pdes), a family of enzymes
that controls intracellular camp/cgmp degradation, differentially regulates proinflammatory cytokines. selective pde1 inhibition (8-methoxymethyl- xxxd2388xxx ) blockaded lipopolysaccharide-endotoxin (lps)-mediated biosynthesis of interleukin (il)-6, but this pathway had no inhibitory
effect on  xxxg2296xxx -␣ (tnf-␣). furthermore, inhibition of  xxxg1695xxx  ( xxxd2341xxx ) abolished the effect of lps on il-6, but
attenuated tnf-␣ production. reversible competitive inhibition
of pde4 ( xxxd3142xxx ) exhibited a potent inhibitory effect on il-6

the alveolar epithelium is recognized as a dynamic barrier
that plays an important role in regulating the inflammatory
and metabolic responses to oxidative stress, sepsis, endotoxemia, and other critical illnesses in the lung (thompson et
al., 1985; freeman et al., 1993; pittet et al., 1995; matuschak
this study was supported by grants from the medical research council,
anonymous trust, and tenovus-scotland (to s.c.l.), and r.l. allocated grants
for supporting this research. j.j.h. holds the georges john livanos prize

and a dual, biphasic (excitatory/inhibitory) effect on tnf-␣ secretion. blockading pde5 (4-{[3⬘,4⬘-(methylenedioxy)benzyl]
amino}-6-methoxyquinazoline) showed a high potency in reducing il-6 production, but in a manner similar to the inhibition
of pde4, exhibited a biphasic effect on tnf-␣ biosynthesis.
simultaneous inhibition of pde5, 6, and 9 (zaprinast), purported
to specifically elevate intracellular cgmp, reduced, in a doseindependent manner, il-6 and tnf-␣ biosynthesis. finally,
nonselective inhibition of pde by  xxxd2880xxx  suppressed
lps-mediated secretion of il-6 and tnf-␣. the involvement of specific pde isoenzymes in differentially regulating
lps-mediated inflammatory cytokine biosynthesis indicates a
novel approach to unravel the potential therapeutic targets that
these isozymes constitute during the progression of inflammation within the respiratory epithelium.

however, has yet to be ascertained and characterized in the
alveolar epithelium. subsequently, we designed a series of
investigations to closely determine the role that selective and
nonselective modulation of pdes plays in regulating proinflammatory cytokines. we herein report the involvement of
specific pde isoenzymes that are differentially regulating
lps-mediated inflammatory cytokine biosynthesis, thereby
indicating a novel approach to unravel the potential therapeutic targets that these isozymes constitute during the progression of inflammation within the respiratory epithelium.

materials and methods
all experimental procedures involving the use of live animals were
reviewed and approved under the animals act legislation, 1986
(united kingdom). unless indicated otherwise, chemicals/reagents
of the highest analytical grade were obtained from sigma-aldrich
(dorset, uk) and calbiochem (nottingham, uk).
primary cultures of alveolar epithelia. fetal alveolar type ii
epithelial cells were isolated from lungs of rat fetuses on gestation
day 19, essentially as described elsewhere (haddad and land,
2000a,b; haddad et al., 2000). briefly, fetal rats were removed from
pregnant sprague-dawley rats by caesarian section at day 19 of
gestation (term of 22 days), and the lungs were excised, teased free
from heart and upper airway tissue, and finely minced then washed
free of erythrocytes by using sterile, chilled mg2⫹- and ca2⫹-free
hanks’  xxxd2988xxx . the cleaned lung tissue was resuspended in 1 ml/fetus hanks’  xxxd2988xxx  containing 0.1
mg/ml trypsin, 0.06 mg/ml collagenase, and 0.012% (w/v) dnase i,
and was agitated at 37°c for 20 min. the solution was then centrifuged at 100g for 2 min to remove undispersed tissue, the supernatant was saved to a fresh sterile tube, and an equal volume of
dulbecco’s modified eagle’s medium (dmem) with 10% (v/v) fetal
calf serum (fcs) was added to the supernatant. after passing the
supernatant through a 120-␮m pore size sterile mesh, the filtrate
was centrifuged at 420g for 5 min, the pellet resuspended in 20 ml of
dmem/fcs, and the cells were placed into a t-150 culture flask for
1 h at 37°c to enable fibroblasts and nonepithelial cells to adhere.
unattached cells were washed three times by centrifugation at 420g
for 5 min each and then seeded onto 24-mm-diameter transwellclear permeable supports (0.4-␮m pore size; costar, cambridge, ma)
at a density of 5 ⫻ 106 cells/filter and were allowed to adhere
overnight (po2 ⫽ 152 torr ⬇21% o2, 5% co2). dmem/fcs was
exchanged for 4 ml of serum-free  xxxg707xxx  media (biowhittaker, walkersville, md) pre-equilibrated to po2 ⫽ 152 torr and 37°c 24 h later
and cells were maintained at this po2 until the experiment. in each
case, and under conditions of independent treatments, the adenylate
energy charge, an index of cell viability and competence, remained
ⱖ0.7 and transepithelial monolayer resistance (rf) was monitored
constantly at 250 to 350 ⍀ 䡠 cm2 (haddad and land, 2000a,b; haddad
et al., 2000). therefore, the static cellular energy charge of cell
cultures treated with various drugs ruled out any nonspecific cytotoxicity. to further confirm this fact, the total protein content of
pretreated cells was determined to be not significantly different (p ⬎
0.05) from control cultures (data not shown). we have also shown
that these drugs selectively interfere with the stabilization, nuclear
translocation, and consensus dna binding activity of the redoxsensitive transcription factor, nuclear factor-␬b, implicating specific
intervention in signaling transduction pathways.
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (elisa) assessment of proinflammatory cytokine profile. the bioactivity of
extracellularly released cytokines was measured by a two-site, solidphase, developed sandwich elisa in cell-free supernatants (haddad
et al., 2001b,c). immunoaffinity-purified polyclonal rabbit anti-rat
il-6 and tnf-␣ (2 ␮g/ml) primary antibodies were used to coat
high-binding microtiter plates (maxisorp; nunc, paisley, scotland,
uk). recombinant rat and biotinylated immunoaffinity-purified

matory mediators (wong et al., 2000). inflammatory as well
as autoimmune disease is often associated with deregulated
expression and biosynthesis of inflammatory cytokines,
which influence a plethora of cellular functions (kelley, 1990;
nicod, 1993). therefore, the down-regulation of an inflammatory signal, and the amplification of a counter anti-inflammatory signal, remain a major focus of the rational approach
to the treatment of inflammatory diseases. for instance, a
novel recent study by haskó et al. (2000) reported a potential
role for extracellular purines, including adenosine and atp,
and inosine, a degradation product of these purines, as potent endogenous immunomodulatory molecules that inhibit
inflammatory cytokine biosynthesis and protect against endotoxin-induced shock. it has also been reported that selective inhibition of phosphodiesterases, a family of isoenzymes
involved in the degradation of cyclic nucleotides (houslay
and milligan, 1997; haskó et al., 1998; perry and higgs,
1998); steroids, such as glucocorticoids (visser et al., 1998);
pyrimidylpiperazine derivatives (fukuda et al., 2000; hisadome et al., 2000; haddad et al., 2001d); and mitogen-activated protein kinase-selective inhibitors (su and karin,
1996; garrington and johnson, 1999; haddad, 2001) differentially regulate the transcription and biosynthesis of inflammatory cytokines/mediators.
the cyclic nucleotides camp and cgmp are ubiquitous
second messengers participating in signaling transduction
pathways and mechanisms (bourne et al., 1972; degerman et
al., 1997; houslay and milligan, 1997; dukarm et al., 1999;
lucas et al., 2000). mammalian cells have evolved a complex
and highly conserved complement of enzymes that regulate
the generation and inactivation of cyclic nucleotides through
multiple and complex feedforward and feedback mechanisms
(bolger et al., 1993; demoliou-mason, 1995; perry and higgs,
1998). both camp and cgmp are formed from their respective triphosphates (atp and gtp) by the catalytic activity of
adenylyl (adenylate) or guanylyl (guanylate) cyclase, respectively (essayan, 1999). inactivation of camp/cgmp is
achieved by hydrolytic cleavage of the 3⬘-phosphodiester
bond catalyzed by the cyclic-nucleotide-dependent phosphodiesterases (pdes), resulting in the formation of the corresponding, inactive 5⬘-monophosphate (perry and higgs,
1998; essayan, 1999). of note, the inflammatory response
and its progression is exquisitely sensitive to modulations in
the steady-state levels of cyclic nucleotides, where target
cells for their effects extend beyond immune cells to include
accessory cells, such as airway smooth muscle, epithelial and
endothelial cells, and neurons (perry and higgs, 1998; essayan, 1999). in this respect, the emerging concept that selective modulation of intracellular cyclic nucleotides plays a
major role in regulating the inflammatory milieu has recently evolved in targeting and ameliorating inflammatory/
autoimmune responses. the cyclic nucleotide pdes are a
large, growing multigene family, comprising at least 10 families of pde isoenzymes (perry and higgs, 1998; essayan,
1999). the profile of selective and nonselective pde inhibitors in vitro and in vivo, therefore, suggested a potential
therapeutic utility as antidepressants, antiproliferative and
immunomodulatory agents, tocolytics, inotropes/chronotropes, and cytoprotective agents (pagani et al., 1992; bolger
et al., 1993; tsuboi et al., 1996; ekholm et al., 1997; essayan,
1999).

phosphodiesterase regulation of proinflammatory cytokines

discussion
within a physiological environment, the lung is remarkable for its stability despite the possession of the potential for
rapid proliferation and tissue remodeling (kelley, 1990;
zeiher and hornick, 1996; rogers and laurent, 1998). the
major participants in the regulation of cellular/molecular
composition of the lung are the cytokines, also known as
peptide growth factors, biological response modifiers, and
inflammatory mediators (kelley, 1990; nicod, 1993). well
known as extracellular signaling proteins transcribed and
biosynthesized in response to various stimuli by specific effector cells, cytokines are crucial molecules in the initiation
and/or progression of inflammatory disease and pulmonary
dysfunction (kelley, 1990; nicod, 1993; rogers and laurent,
1998). aberrant regulation of cytokines or their selective
receptors may therefore contribute to the exacerbation of
disease condition. indeed, such dysregulation has been implicated in a number of human diseases, including sepsis
syndrome (beutler and cerami, 1986), psoriasis (elder et al.,
1989), autosomal recessive disorders associated with premature aging (bauer et al., 1986), adult respiratory distress
syndrome (bunnell and pacht, 1993), idiopathic pulmonary
fibrosis (cantin et al., 1989), crohn’s disease and ulcerative
colitis (reimund et al., 1998), allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (wark and gibson, 2001), bronchopulmonary dysplasia (saugstad, 1997), cystic fibrosis (doring, 1996; zeiher
and hornick, 1996), and rheumatoid arthritis (feldmann and
maini, 2001).
insight into the molecular mechanisms of the regulatory
role of cytokines in cellular homeostasis as well as inflammatory/autoimmune/infectious diseases has begun to provide
new approaches to design therapeutic strategies for pharmacological interventions (zeiher and hornick, 1996; rogers
and laurent, 1998). one such novel approach is the chemotherapeutic potential of pde isoenzyme blockade, which revealed a phenomenal diversity and complexity scheme for
promising therapeutics across a broad spectrum of disease

states (perry and higgs, 1998; essayan, 1999). one mechanistic understanding of pde inhibition is centered on the
immunomodulatory properties of cyclic nucleotides (camp/
cgmp), thereby paving a channel through which anti-inflammatory, therapeutic applications could be clearly demonstrated (perry and higgs, 1998; essayan, 1999). the
observations herein reported revealed the involvement of
selective pde isoenzymes in differentially modulating an
inflammatory signal mediated by cytokines, for the moment
specific to alveolar epithelial cells, recognized as major participants in the evolution and progression of inflammatory
disease contracted and amplified from within the pulmonary,
infiltrated milieu (thompson et al., 1985; kelley, 1990; freeman et al., 1993; pittet et al., 1995; matuschak and lechner,
1996; zeiher and hornick, 1996; rogers and laurent, 1998;
matthay et al., 2000; haddad et al., 2001b,c).
there are three pde1 isoenzymes, termed  xxxg1692xxx , 1b, and
1c, respectively (perry and higgs, 1998; essayan, 1999). the
catalytic activity of this subtype of pdes is regulated via
calmodulin-binding domains, thereby allowing for control by
intracellular ca2⫹. pde1 isoforms hydrolyze both camp (km
⫽ 1–30 ␮m) and cgmp (km ⫽ 3 ␮m), although different
isoenzymes inactivate either nucleotide with different preference (perry and higgs, 1998). the primary distribution of
pde1 isoenzymes includes a variety of tissues, especially the
heart, brain, lung, and smooth muscle (essayan, 1999). despite the limitations of having selective inhibitors with preference to either of the aforementioned isoenzymes, vinpocetine and 8-methoxymethyl- xxxd2388xxx  have emerged as selective
inhibitors of ca2⫹-calmodulin-dependent pdei (demolioumason, 1995; perry and higgs, 1998; essayan, 1999). 8-methoxymethyl- xxxd2388xxx  is a xanthine derivative whose structureactivity relationship revealed a selective potency against
pde1, despite its mild, nonselective inhibitory effect on
pde5 (wells and miller, 1988; perry and higgs, 1998; essayan, 1999; piaz and giovannoni, 2000). although 8-methoxymethyl- xxxd2388xxx  efficiently reduced lps-mediated il-6
biosynthesis, it has no apparent effect whatsoever on tnf-␣
secretion. although the molecular basis for this preferential
discrepancy is not understood, it is possible that 8-methoxymethyl- xxxd2388xxx  selectively targets inflammatory cytokines. il-6, also termed interferon-␤, is involved in the induction of acute phase protein synthesis during the process of
pulmonary inflammation (kelley, 1990; nicod, 1993). we
have reported that alveolar epithelial cells strongly responded to exogenous irritants, such as lps, by up-regulating il-6 and other mediators (haddad et al., 2001a,b,c,d) and
that exogenous cytokines, such as tnf-␣, regulate endogenous formation of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines by
an autocrine mechanism (j. j. haddad, n. e. saadé, b.
safieh-garabedian, and s. c. land, unpublished observations). among those cytokines regulated by tnf-␣, il-6 is a
likely candidate; however, whether 8-methoxymethyl-ibmxmediated down-regulation of il-6 is tnf-␣-dependent cannot be excluded, but its inability to suppress lps-mediated
tnf-␣ biosynthesis rather suggested the involvement of a
tnf-␣-insensitive pathway mediating the inhibitory effect of
pdei1 on il-6 production.
 xxxg1695xxx  and  xxxg1696xxx  isoforms are products of different
genes located on chromosomes 12 and 11, respectively (perry

contrary to pde1 and 2, pde5, which is reportedly
present in lung tissue and platelets with more limited tissue
distribution in comparison with other pdes, catalyzes the
hydrolysis of cgmp with absolute specificity (perry and
higgs, 1998; essayan, 1999). mbmq is one such selective
inhibitor of cgmp-specific pde5. it elevates intracellular
cgmp level (km ⫽ 1 ␮m) without causing any change in the
camp level (km ⫽ 150 ␮m) (essayan, 1999). on the other
hand, zaprinast exhibits potential inhibitory effects of cgmpspecific pde5, 6, and 9 (km ⫽ 2000 and 60 ␮m for camp and
cgmp, respectively) (perry and higgs, 1998; cobrin and
francis, 1999; essayan, 1999). these potent inhibitors of
pde5 have been profiled extensively in preclinical models,
especially those of cardiovascular disease (eddahibi et al.,
1998; perry and higgs, 1998; dukarm et al., 1999). in a
manner similar to  xxxd3142xxx , mbmq exhibited a dual effect on
tnf-␣, but blockaded the production of il-6. in contrast,
zaprinast abolished the excitatory effect of lps on both
tnf-␣ and il-6, suggesting a nonspecific inhibition that is
not solely confined with pde5 blockade, thereby implicating
other pdes. despite the fact that the molecular basis for this
dual discrepancy has yet to be ascertained, the mobility and
efficiency of selective pde inhibition may thus explain the
involvement of one pathway or another mediating the effect
of specific pde isoenzymes in regulating a proinflammatory
signal within the alveolar space.
 xxxd2880xxx  is a rheologically active hemorheological
agent for the treatment of peripheral vascular disease, cerebrovascular disease, and a number of other conditions involving a defective regional microcirculation (ward and clissold,
1987). in addition,  xxxd2880xxx  is a nonspecific pde inhibitor, recognized as a modulator of immune functions with
immunopharmacological efficiency. for instance,  xxxd2880xxx  is well known for its clinical implications in regulating
proinflammatory cytokines (edwards et al., 1992; van furth
et al., 1997; poulakis et al., 1999; marcikiewicz et al., 2000)
and in the treatment of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (lauterbach and szymura-oleksiak, 1999) and sepsis (lauterbach
and zembala, 1996; staudinger et al., 1996; szymura-oleksiak et al., 1997; lauterbach et al., 1999). equipotently active,  xxxd2880xxx  reduced lps-dependent biosynthesis of
il-6 and tnf-␣, with comparable mechanics. on the mechanism of action of this rather nonspecific inhibition, it has
been previously reported that  xxxd2880xxx  may act as a
 xxxd2738xxx  and reactive nitrogen species (rns) scavenger
(lauterbach et al., 1995; gómez-cambronero et al., 2000)
and up-regulate a counter, anti-inflammatory loop via il-10
(van furth et al., 1997). moreover, we have previously reported a key role for the compartmentalization of intracellular ros in the induction of inflammatory cytokines (haddad
et al., 2001b,c). whether the inhibitory effect of  xxxd2880xxx 
on il-6 and tnf-␣ production is secondary to its effect on
intracellular ros/rns remains a possible mechanism. besides, the likely involvement of an il-10-sensitive pathway
mediating the effect of  xxxd2880xxx  on proinflammatory
cytokines is rather supported by equivocal evidence implicating il-10 in regulating inflammatory mediators within the
alveolar epithelium (haddad et al., 2001d). taken together,
the potent anti-inflammatory potential of  xxxd2880xxx 
points to a multifaceted mechanism of action: it is possible
that this nonselective pde inhibitor regulates an inflammatory signal by counteracting intracellular ros/rns and up-

fering selectivity to bind with mutually competitive affinities
to camp and cgmp (km ⫽ 0.2 and 0.3 ␮m, respectively)
(degerman et al., 1997; perry and higgs, 1998).  xxxg1695xxx  isoforms are particularly distributed within heart, lung, liver,
platelets, immunocytes, and adipose tissues (perry and
higgs, 1998).  xxxg1695xxx , furthermore, is known for its cgmpinhibited characteristics because some biological effects of
endogenous cgmp may be mediated by inhibition of  xxxg1695xxx ,
which results in increased camp and activation of campdependent protein kinase (degerman et al., 1997).  xxxd2341xxx 
is one of the selective inhibitors of  xxxg1695xxx  and a plethora of
other selective inhibitors have been already identified
(degerman et al., 1997; perry and higgs, 1998). selective
inhibition of  xxxg1695xxx  emerged with similar behavior to the
effect of 8-methoxymethyl- xxxd2388xxx , despite the observation
that  xxxd2341xxx  at 100 ␮m partially reduced lps-mediated
secretion of tnf-␣, with strong inhibitory mechanics on il-6
biosynthesis. this effect bears an interesting therapeutic
approach, because type 3 pdes have been reported to be
active in the airway epithelium (kelley et al., 1995), consistent with the notion that selective  xxxg1695xxx  blockade interfered
with the progression of cystic fibrosis in vivo (al-nakkash
and hwang, 1999; smith et al., 1999), reduced ischemiareperfusion injury in the heart (rechtman et al., 2000), and
conferred cardiac protection under surgery (butterworth et
al., 1995).
pde4 isoforms are camp-specific (km ⫽ 4 ␮m) and cgmpinsensitive (km ⬎ 3000 ␮m) phosphodiesterases, distributed
in sertoli cells, kidney, brain, liver, lung, and immunocytes
(essayan, 1999). there are four pde4 genes encoding distinct isoforms (a, b, c, and d) with additional diversity
particularly arising from alternative initiation sites and/or
alternative splicing (perry and higgs, 1998). the immunopharmacological potential of  xxxd3142xxx , a selective inhibitor of
pde4, is well documented. for instance, it was reported that,
from a functional standpoint, the up-regulation of pde4 activity resulted in a heterologous desensitization to the actions of  xxxd1903xxx  and, presumably, other adenylyl
cyclase activators, thereby conceivably concluding that this
regulatory pathway could compromise the long-term antiasthmatic efficacy of ␤-adrenoreceptor agonists (torphy et
al., 1995). furthermore, it has been recently reported that
the second-generation pde4 inhibitor ( xxxd1697xxx ,  xxxd1697xxx )
has antiasthmatic activity in vivo (underwood et al., 1998)
and an anti-inflammatory potential in vitro (barnette et al.,
1998), indicating a therapeutic potential for the treatment of
asthma and other allergic/inflammatory disorders. of note,
subtype selective inhibition of pde4 has been shown to suppress human inflammatory cell function (manning et al.,
1999), inflammatory hyperalgesia (cunha et al., 1999), and
immunological inflammation (boichot et al., 2000; ehinger et
al., 2000). our results jive with the anti-inflammatory potential assigned to pde4 inhibition, consistent with the observations reported that  xxxd3142xxx  (semmler et al., 1993;
kasyapa et al., 1999),  xxxd1697xxx  (griswold et al., 1998), and
 xxxd2945xxx  (brideau et al., 1999) regulate mediator-effected
biosynthesis of tnf-␣, leukotrienes, and other interleukins.
the observation, however, that  xxxd3142xxx  exhibited a dual
response on lps-mediated tnf-␣ production remains of particular interest in the alveolar epithelium, indicating dosedependent specificity and cytokine selectivity (il-6 versus
tnf-␣).

regulating a feedforward/feedback loop via amplification of
il-10. this latter mechanism, nevertheless, despite its eligibility, remains to be identified as part of the mechanism of
action of  xxxd2880xxx . however, the possibility that  xxxd2880xxx  suppresses il-6 via direct inhibition of tnf-␣
cannot be excluded (staudinger et al., 1996; lauterbach et
al., 1999).
the observations reported herein have revealed a novel
anti-inflammatory action of selective pde inhibition, a mechanism that may counteract the deleterious effects of overboosting an inflammatory response originating from within,
and spreading of, the respiratory epithelium. these results
could be highlighted as follows: 1) pde1 inhibition reduced
lps-mediated biosynthesis of il-6, whereas it had no inhibitory effect on tnf-␣; 2) inhibition of  xxxg1695xxx  abolished the
effect of lps on il-6 but attenuated tnf-␣ production; 3)
reversible inhibition of pde4 exhibited a potent inhibitory
effect on il-6 and a dual (excitatory/inhibitory) effect on
tnf-␣; 4) inhibiting pde5 showed a high potency in reducing il-6 production, but exhibited a biphasic effect on tnf-␣;
5) simultaneous inhibition of pde5, 6, and 9 reduced il-6
and tnf-␣ secretion; and 6) nonselective inhibition by  xxxd2880xxx  suppressed lps-mediated secretion of il-6 and
tnf-␣. the involvement of specific pde isoenzymes in differentially regulating inflammatory cytokines thereby indicates a novel approach to unravel the potential therapeutic
targets that these isozymes constitute during the progression
of inflammation.
