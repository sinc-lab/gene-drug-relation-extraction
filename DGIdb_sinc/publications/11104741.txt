evidence for possible involvement of 5-ht(2b) receptors in the cardiac valvulopathy associated with fenfluramine and other serotonergic medications.  serotonergic medications with various mechanisms of action are used to treat psychiatric disorders and are being investigated as treatments for drug dependence. the occurrence of fenfluramine-associated valvular heart disease (vhd) has raised concerns that other serotonergic medications might also increase the risk of developing vhd. we hypothesized that fenfluramine or its metabolite norfenfluramine and other medications known to produce vhd have preferentially high affinities for a particular  xxxg1114xxx  subtype capable of stimulating mitogenesis.
