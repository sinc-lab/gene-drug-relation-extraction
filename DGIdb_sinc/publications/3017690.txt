benzodiazepine receptors and their relationship to the
treatment of epilepsy

summary: benzodiazepines (bdz) interact with components of neuronal
membranes to modify excitability in three different ways. (1) action at a high
affinity central receptor (dissociation constant, kd, of 3 nm) linked to the gabaa recognition site enhances the inhibitory action of gaba by increasing the
number of openings of c1- channels produced by a given concentration of
gaba. this effect correlates with anticonvulsant activity as evaluated in the
antipentylenetetrazol test in animals and with antimyoclonic activity in human
beings. it also correlates with anxiolytic activity. (2) action at a lower affinity
membrane site (kd 100 nm to 1 pm) limits repetitive firing as observed in isolated neurons (in a manner similar to the action of phenytoin or carbamazepine). this does not depend primarily on neurotransmitter mechanisms, but
probably involves an increase in the population of sodium channels in the inactive state. (3) action at a lower affinity site (kd 45 pm) in presynaptic terminals decreases voltage sensitive ca++conductance and, by limiting ca++entry, decreases neurotransmitter release. the two lower affinity bdz systems may
be responsible for therapeutic action in status epilepticus and for sedative sideeffects. the high affinity central benzodiazepine binding sites can be differentiated into bz, and bz, receptors by ligands (such as triazolopyridazines and
 xxxd3058xxx ) that preferentially act on bz, sites. there are regional differences
in the density of the two receptor subtypes, but these have not yet been correlated with specific actions of benzodiazepines. differences between various
1,4- and 1,s-benzodiazepines in terms of therapeutic action in epilepsy and
neurologic side-effects can probably be explained on the basis of variation in
full or partial agonist action at the high affinity central receptor, or differing
relative action at the high and low affinity receptors. key words: p-carbolines-benzodiazepine receptors-gaba.

leur action agoniste partielle ou totale au niveau du recepteur central a haute

introduction

benzodiazepine receptors

1,4-benzodiazepines, such as diazepam and clonazepam, have been used clinically as antiepileptic
agents; 1,5-benzodiazepines such as  xxxd1718xxx  have
been used for about 7 years.
understanding of the molecular mechanisms of
action of benzodiazepines has developed rapidly
within the last 10 years. the suggestion that benzodiazepines act by enhancing the inhibitory action
of gaba at postsynaptic (and presynaptic) sites
originally arose from neurophysiologic studies
(haefely et al., 1975). subsequently, studies of brain
membrane preparations using various [3h] ligands
have led to the identification of high affinity benzodiazepine receptors linked to gaba receptors.
other interactions of benzodiazepines with membrane sites produce neuronal inhibition by presumed actions on na+, ca++ , and k+ conductance
channels.

an operational definition of “benzodiazepine receptors” was first provided in 1977 with the demonstration of the binding of [3h]-diazepam to brain
membrane homogenates and its displacement by
pharmacologically active 1,cbenzodiazepines and
not by a wide range of other centrally acting drugs
(mohler and okada, 1977; squires and braestrup,
1977). initially, benzodiazepines were thought to be
the only class of psychoactive drugs that bound (or
displaced) at this site. however, a wide range of
compounds were subsequently shown to displace
[3h]-diazepam or [3h]-flunitrazepambinding to brain
membranes. these are listed in table 1, and the
molecular structures of representative compounds
are illustrated in fig. 1. many of these compounds
reproduce the behavioral effects of benzodiazepines
in rodent tests that are considered to be indicative
of anticonvulsant and anxiolytic activity. some compounds, closely related structurally to these anxiolytic/anticonvulsants, have little intrinsic activity in
behavioral tests, but block the anxiolytic and anticonvulsant effects of diazepam and other active

membrane preparations. as indicated in table 1, all these compounds are anticonvulsant except for p-ccm (methyl-p-carbolined-carboxylate) and dmcm (methyc6,7-dimethoxy-4-ethyl-pcarboline-3-carboxylate).

central versus peripheral receptors
there is clear evidence for a central benzodiazepine receptor type found exclusively in the brain and
for a peripheral type found in many tissues including mast cells, platelets, heart, and kidney, and also
in brain. clonazepam, methyl clonazepam, and ro
15-1788 selectively bind to the central receptor,
whereas ro 5-4864(a p-chloro-derivative of diazepam) binds selectively to the peripheral receptor.
the binding of benzodiazepines to the central type
receptor exhibits stereospecificity, whereas binding
to the peripheral type receptor does not (wang et
al., 1984). the role of the peripheral receptor (or
acceptor) site is uncertain, but a function relating to
nerve growth has been proposed (morgan et al.,
1985). however, moderate doses of ro 5-4864are
convulsant in mice. an isoquinoline derivative, pk
11195,displaces ro 5-4864from its binding sites and
has been claimed to reduce the convulsant action of
ro 5-4864(file, 1984). a study of analogues of ro
5-4864,however suggests that its convulsant effect
arises from an action at the chloride ionophore (picrotoxinin site) and not at the “peripheral” benzodiazepine ( xxxd1459xxx ) binding site (weissman et al.,
1985). autoradiographic studies with [3h] pk 11195
indicate that the main peripheral receptor sites within

agents. the most intensively studied compounds of
this type are ro 15-1788and cgs 8216, which are
regarded as “neutral” benzodiazepine antagonists.
the search for an endogenous agent acting at the
benzodiazepine receptor has lead to: (1) the discovery of the convulsant and anxiogenic properties of
p-carboline-3-carboxylatemethyl and ethyl esters
and some of their derivatives (braestrup et al.,
1980), and (2)the isolation of a peptide (diazepambinding inhibitor, dbi) one segment of which, an
octadecaneuropeptide, is particularly potent in tests
thought to be indicative of anxiogenic activity (guidotti et al., 1983; ferrero et al., 1984). a recent
study using monoclonal antibodies suggests that
there are several brain peptides with benzodiazepine-like actions (sangameswaran and de blas,
1985).
in this review, we examine the evidence for the
existence of different types of benzodiazepine receptors, their functional significance and possible
contribution to the phenomena of epilepsy, and their
role in the anticonvulsant action of benzodiazepines
and related drugs.

benzodiazepine receptors

the brain are in the olfactory bulb, the median eminence, choroid plexus, and ependyma (benavides
et al., 1983).
purines such as inosine, hypoxanthine, and caffeine displace benzodiazepines that bind selectively
at central receptors, but do not displace ro 5-4864
(skerritt et al., 1982).  xxxd1914xxx  (an inhibitor of
adenosine uptake) preferentially displaces ro 5-4864
(benavides et al., 1983).

anticonvulsant action and the high affinity
central benzodiazepine receptor
studies of displacement of [3h] -diazepam or [3h]flunitrazepam binding using a wide range of benzodiazepines in vitro and in vivo show a very strong
correlation between relative anticonvulsant potency
(as assessed in the threshold pentylenetetrazol convulsion test in rodents) and the id,, for displacement of label from high affinity binding sites (duka
et al., 1979; braestrup and nielsen, 1982). this is
shown in fig. 2. although the quantitative data are
less precise, the same rank order for anticonvulsant
potency seems to apply for seizures induced in rodents by 3-mercaptopropionic acid, thiosemicarbazide, or  xxxd2947xxx . it is also true for some genetically determined syndromes of reflex epilepsy which
provide convenient test systems (sound-induced seizures in d b n 2 mice and photically induced seizures in the senegalese baboons, papio papio)
(meldrum and braestrup, 1984).
although an adequate range of benzodiazepines

has not been evaluated clinically in human subjects
to permit accurate comparison, the greater potency
of clonazepam compared with diazepam in myoclonic syndromes and primary generalised epilepsy
suggests that the same rank order of anticonvulsant
potency is found in human beings. this rank order
is not found if maximal electroshock is the test system (see discussion that follows).
studies of the correlation between the proportion
of benzodiazepine receptors occupied (as judged by
in vivo displacement of [3h]-flunitrazepam) and anticonvulsant effects in rodent models indicate that in
several animal test systems, a maximal anticonvulsant effect can be obtained when only a very small
proportion of receptor sites are occupied by the anticonvulsant benzodiazepine (duka et al., 1979;
jensen et al., 1983).
in contrast, certain anticonvulsant p-carboline derivatives (see herein) produce a maximal anticonvulsant action only when a relatively high proportion of the sites binding flunitrazepam are occupied.
this phenomenon can be interpreted in terms of full
and partial agonist action.

astrocytes vs. neurons
initial studies employing bulk separation techniques suggested that diazepam bound more potently to glia than to neurons (henn and henke,
1978). studies of [3h]-flunitrazepam binding in primary cultures of astrocytes (tardy et al., 1981;
bender and hertz, 1984) indicate a large number of

high affinity binding sites. at these “nanomolar”
sites, ro 5-4864 is a more potent displacer of flunitrazepam than is clonazepam, indicating that they are
of the peripheral type.

bz, versus bz, receptors

,

the initial binding data (including scatchard plots)
indicated that there was only one class of high affinity benzodiazepine receptors in the brain membrane
preparations. subsequent studies with other chemical classes of compound have suggested that there
are two subtypes of benzodiazepine receptors with
different regional distributions in the brain. in particular, the triazolopyridazine, cl 218 872, shows
heterogeneous binding, with high affinity (comparable with flunitrazepam) at one subtype (“bz, receptor”) and low affinity at the other subtype (“bz,
receptor”). the proportion of these receptor subtypes varies greatly between brain regions. bz, is
predominant in the cerebellum; bz2 and bz, are of
equivalent density in the hippocampus (lippa et al.,
1979). this provides a method for comparing benzodiazepines and other compounds binding to the
high affinity benzodiazepine receptor in terms of
their relative selectivity for bz, and bz, receptor
subtypes (table 2).
 xxxd3058xxx  and lorazepam bind preferentially at
bz, receptors, as do p-ccm and p-cce. however,
 xxxd1718xxx  and dmcm do not.
there is a marked ontogenetic difference between the two receptor subtypes. bz, receptors are
virtually absent in newborn rats and develop after 7
to 16 days, while bz, receptors are significantly
present at birth and increase rapidly in the first 4
days (lippa et al., 1980).
the differences in regional brain distribution of
bz, and bz, receptors have lead to the suggestion
that they may differ in terms of their localisation on
neuronal membranes. an autoradiographic study of
the substantia nigra reticulata 13 days after deafferentation (by lesioning the striatum) showed an increase in density of bz, receptors and a decrease in
bz, receptors, which was interpreted in terms of bz,
receptors being predominantly postsynaptic and bz,
receptors being predominantly presynaptic (lo et al.,
1983). a subsequent study, however, showed an increase in bz, receptors in substantia nigra reticulata
2 to 3 months after deafferentation (pan et al., 1984).
techniques for the physical separation of presynaptic terminals and postsynaptic densities indicate
that there is no consistent preferential localization
of bz, and bz, receptors pre- or postsynaptically,
but that there are significant variations between brain
regions in their subcellular distribution (tietz et al.,
1985).

s7

high affinity “nanomolar” versus low affinity
“micromolar” binding sites
the “central type” benzodiazepine receptors initially described bind nanomolar (nm) concentrations of diazepam or flunitrazepam. sites that show
selective, stereospecific binding of micromolar concentrations of benzodiazepines have been defined in
rat brain membranes (bowling and delorenzo,
1982). phenytoin inhibits [3h]-diazepam binding to
“low affinity receptors,” and diazepam inhibits
phenytoin binding to brain membrane. ro 5-4864
displaces [3h]-diazepam at low affinity brain sites.
if suppression of tonic extension in the maximal
electroshock test is used as the measure of anticonvulsant potency, a correlation with binding potency
is observed at the low affinity (micromolar) binding
sites, i.e., with diazepam appearing as potent as
clonazepam (fig. 3). the maximal electroshock test
emphasizes drugs (such as phenylhydantoin) that
have properties very different from drugs identified
by the ptz test. the molecular mechanisms that
may involve the “micromolar” receptor just described are of two types. in in vitro electrophysiologic tests with spinal neurons in isolated culture, potency in the maximal electroshock test correlates with

benzodiazepine receptors

suppression of electrically induced repetitive firing.
in contrast, potency in the ptz threshold test correlates with enhancement of the inhibitory effect of
gaba on isolated neurons (macdonald, 1983). this
action on repetitive firing is seen with concentrations of diazepam in the range 88 to 175 nm (skerritt et al., 1984). it corresponds with the binding sites
with an apparent kd of 100 to 200 nm (delorenzo
and taft, 1986).
the low affinity benzodiazepine binding sites,
originally described by bowling and delorenzo
(1982), are thought to operate on presynaptic terminals to reduce ca++ entry and, thus, synaptic
neurotransmitter release. the uptake of 45ca into
synaptosomes is blocked by micromolar concentrations of benzodiazepine and by phenytoin; this has
been shown to be a specific effect on the voltage-dependent ca++ entry (taft and delorenzo, 1984;
johansen et al., 1985). various benzodiazepines
show similar relative potency for inhibiting micromolar diazepam binding, synaptosomal ca++ uptake,
and suppression of maximal electroshock.
various other effects of benzodiazepines on ionic
conductances have been described. these include an
augmentation of the ca++-mediated potassium conductance by nanomolar concentrations of midazolam. this has the effect of hyperpolarizing the neurons (carlen et al., 1983).

convulsant and anticonvulsant
p-carbolines
a search for an endogenous ligand at the benzodiazepine receptor led to the demonstration that
ethyl, methyl, and propyl-esters of p-carboline 3carboxylic acid compete with 1,4benzodiazepines for
high affinity binding sites (braestrup et al., 1980;
braestrup and nielsen, 1981). it was subsequently
shown that the methoxy p-carboline 3-carboxylic acid
and its substituted derivative, dmcm, are potent
convulsant agents (cowen et al., 1981; oakley and
jones, 1980, 1982). these convulsions can be
blocked by the prior or subsequent administration
of ro 15-1788, indicating that binding at the high affinity central benzodiazepine receptor is responsible
(braestrup et al., 1982; schweri et al., 1982; jensen
et al., 1983). there is evidence from kinetic studies
of flunitrazepam binding that convulsant p-carbolines may act at a separate allosteric site rather than
competing at the benzodiazepine receptor (chiu and
rosenberg, 1985). a correlation between the incidence of convulsions and the percentage of [3h]flunitrazepam binding sites occupied has been observed (braestrup et al., 1982). subconvulsant doses
of p-ccm or dmcm facilitate the sensory provocation of seizures in susceptible animals (such as

cally induced seizures in papio papio baboons (jensen et al., 1983; croucher et al., 1984).
testing a wide range of substituted derivatives of
p-carboline 3-carboxylic acid has led to the identification of several such compounds that are potent
anticonvulsants in animal test systems (meldrum et
al., 1983c; meldrum, 1984). zk 91296 is as potent
as diazepam when evaluated in terms of suppression
of myoclonic response in photosensitive baboons
(fig. 4), but in tests of ataxia in rodents, it is more
than 100 times less potent (petersen et al., 1984). zk
93423 has similar anticonvulsant action in baboons,
but is also a potent muscle relaxant (klockgether et
al., 1985). thus, the separation of the anticonvulsant action from the acute neurologic side-effects is
shown only by selected anticonvulsant p-carboline
derivatives. it appears to be related to a partial agonist action. compounds, such as the standard 1,4benzodiazepines and some p-carbolines, can produce a full anticonvulsant action when only a small
proportion of benzodiazepine sites are occupied
(duka et al., 1979; jensen et al., 1983), whereas the
compounds considered to have a partial agonist action, such as zk 91296, show a normal anticonvulsant action only when the majority of high affinity
benzodiazepine receptors are occupied (petersen et
al., 1984).
this mechanism may account for the lesser impairment of motor performance observed with anticonvulsant doses of  xxxd1718xxx  as compared to diazepam.
genetically-determined syndromes of epilepsy and
abnormalities of the gaba-benzodiazepine
receptor complex
the clear evidence that convulsions can be induced or facilitated when the operation of the
gaba-benzodiazepine receptor system is impaired, raises the possibility that some natural syndromes of epilepsy may be due to abnormalities in
this system. among the genetic syndromes of epilepsy occurring in animals, those in sound susceptible (dba/2) mice, “genetically epilepsy-prone’’ or
audiogenic seizure (ags) rats, gerbils, hens, and
photosensitive baboons have been the subject of
relevant biochemical and pharmacologic studies.
these suggest that abnormalities of the gaba-benzodiazepine receptor systems do occur in these syndromes, but their exact relationship to the gene defect or the epileptic phenotype is not yet established.
in vitro studies of membrane receptor binding
properties have demonstrated abnormalities at the
brain stem level in d b n 2 mice (horton et al., 1982)
and in the hippocampus in ags rats (tacke and

s9

braestrup, 1984). brain slice autoradiography using
[3h]-flunitrazepam shows a reduction in the number
of high affinity binding sites in several midbrain areas
(inferior colliculus, laterodorsal segmental nucleus,
central gray areas, and the substantia nigra) (olsen
et al., 1986). a similar reduction in the number of
benzodiazepine receptors is found in the midbrain
(substantia nigra and periaqueductal gray matter) of
seizure-susceptible gerbils (olsen et al., 1985).
pharmacologic studies suggest that such apparent
receptor abnormalities are of functional significance. thus, animal strains with genetically determined seizure responses show abnormal sensitivity
to the convulsant or anticonvulsant actions of drugs
acting on the gaba-benzodiazepine receptor system. seizure-prone gerbils are particularly responsive to the anticonvulsant action of gaba-related
anticonvulsants (loscher et al., 1983).
data concerning the convulsant action of p-carbolines in d b n 2 mice, hens, and baboons are summarked in table 3. the convulsant action of @-carboline derivatives appears to depend on actions at
two functionally distinct benzodiazepine receptors.
this is shown by the differing in vitro and in vivo actions of dmcm and p-ccm. in vitro dmcm has
more potent actions on excitatory amino acid release than does @-ccm(chapman et al., 1985). in
vivo convulsions following (3-ccm may be more
specifically dependent on action at the bz, receptor
subtype. thus,  xxxd3058xxx  is preferentially active
against seizures induced by p-ccm in mice (fig. 5).
there is, as yet, no evidence that a primary disorder of the gaba-benzodiazepine receptor system is responsible for any syndrome of epilepsy in
human beings.
linkage of gaba and benzodiazepine
receptors and habituation
the close functional linkage between the gaba
rzcognition site and the benzodiazepine receptor can
be shown in electrophysiologic studies of single neurons (skerritt and macdonald, 1984) and in two types
of interaction in membrane binding studies. benzodiazepines increase low affinity gaba binding
(skerritt et al., 1982). the binding of benzodiazepines is enhanced in the presence of gaba (olsen,
1981). this interaction is of particular interest, first
because an inverse effect is seen with inverse agonists (i.e., the binding of convulsant p-carbolines is
decreased in the presence of gaba) (braestmp and
nielsen, 1981), and second, because it appears to
provide an explanation for the mechanism of habituation. the habituation or “escape” phenomenon

can be demonstrated in rodents following administration of a high dose of benzodiazepine for 2 to 4
weeks (rosenberg et al., 1985). brain membrane
preparations from habituated infant rats show a reduction in the normal gaba (or muscimo1)-induced enhancement of benzodiazepine binding, suggesting that the close physical coupling between the
gaba and benzodiazepine receptor sites has been
rendered ineffective (massotti et al., 1980). this
phenomenon applies only to the high affinity central
benzodiazepine receptor linked to the gaba, recognition site. thus, habituation related to micromolar sites (and protection against maximal electroshock and sedative side-effects) must depend on other
mechanisms. in a recent report, stephens and
schneider (1985) found no change in the coupling of
gaba and benzodiazepine receptors in mice toldmcm

erant to the anxiolytic activity of diazepam.
it is possible that partial agonists at the high affinity benzodiazepine receptor (such as the anticonvulsant p-carboline zk 91296) may be less effective at
uncoupling the linkage between the benzodiazepine
receptor and the gaba recognition site and, thus,
not induce habituation.
conclusions

the major anticonvulsant action of benzodiazepines is produced through an action at a high affinity receptor site that is part of the gaba receptor
complex. the inhibitory effect of synaptically released gaba is enhanced through an increase in the
number of c1- channel openings. actions at the
same molecular site are probably responsible for the
anxiolytic and myorelaxant properties of benzodiazepines.
differences between benzodiazepines in terms of
the spectrum of anticonvulsant activity and the ratio
of anticonvulsant potency to the sedative and motor
side-effects are probably attributable to differences
in receptor subtype specificity and in the degree of
partial (or full) agonist action. some benzodiazepines also show actions on membrane ionic conductances (na’, k + and ca++)that depend on low
affinity benzodiazepine receptor sites that are not
related to the gaba receptor. these interactions
may contribute to therapeutic action of benzodiazepines, particularly in status epilepticus.

discussion
dr. kisch (west germany): dr. meldrum, with
regards to the ionic effects of gaba, are the sodium and potassium conductances affected by the
administration of benzodiazepines? further, have
you any information regarding the blood-brain
barrier and benzodiazepines?

epilepsia, vol. 27, suppl. 1, 1986

dr. meldrum: the ionic specificity of the actions
of benzodiazepines, in so far as they concern the
benzodiazepine receptor linked to the gaba receptor , is highly specific for chloride conductance. the other type of anticonvulsant effect that
i mentioned, which is assessed in the electro-

b. s . meldrum and a . g. chapman
shock test and does not depend on the gaba receptor, is possibly related to changes in sodium
channels. in isolated neurons, there is an effect
on the inactivation of the sodium channel that
follows spike generation, and this prevents repetitive firing. this is a type of action that is shown
by phenylhydantoin and diazepam, but it doesn't
correlate with the antipentylene tetrazole action
of benzodiazepines.
in answer *to the blood-brain barrier question,
most of the benzodiazepines, of course, penetrate
very readily and, in general, this is not regarded
as a problem.

s13

dr. hebebrend (west germany): how do you interpret the recent results by the group of mohler
(using monoclonal antibodies to the benzodiazepine receptor) who could not find a difference between the bz, and bz, receptors? they found the
antibodies were able to detect two bands in the
cerebellum and two bands in hippocampus.
dr. meldrum: the peptide structures of the two
receptor subtypes are likely to be closely similar.
the differences in structure or conformational
state responsible for the differing interactions with
 xxxd3058xxx  or triazolopyridazines are not understood.
