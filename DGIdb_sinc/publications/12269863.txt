 xxxd3135xxx  is an orally active serotonin 5-ht1 receptor agonist that potently
and selectively binds to  xxxg1109xxx /1d subtypes.
earlier clinical trials demonstrated that  xxxd3135xxx  5 or 10mg is more effective
than placebo at providing pain relief and a pain-free state, relieving associated
symptoms of migraine, normalising functional ability and improving patient
quality of life, and showed that  xxxd3135xxx  provides faster freedom from pain and
reduces nausea to a greater extent than oral sumatriptan.
more recently,  xxxd3135xxx  10mg was shown to be more effective than  xxxd3562xxx  2.5mg or naratriptan 2.5mg at producing a pain-free state 2 hours
postdose. furthermore, compared with naratriptan, significantly more patients
who received  xxxd3135xxx  were pain free or had pain relief from 1 hour onwards.
the number of patients with normal functional ability at 2 hours was significantly
higher after  xxxd3135xxx  than after naratriptan or  xxxd3562xxx .  xxxd3135xxx  was also
generally more effective than  xxxd3562xxx  or naratriptan at relieving migraineassociated symptoms.
 xxxd3135xxx  is generally well tolerated, and adverse events are usually mild
and transient. the most common adverse events associated with  xxxd3135xxx  in
recent randomised trials were asthenia/fatigue, dizziness, somnolence and nausea. there was a trend towards a lower incidence of adverse events with  xxxd3135xxx  compared with  xxxd3562xxx  (31.2 vs 38.8%). however,  xxxd3135xxx  was
associated with a significantly higher incidence of adverse events than naratriptan
(39 vs 29%). the incidence of chest pain was similar after the administration of
 xxxd3135xxx ,  xxxd3562xxx  or naratriptan (2–4%).
in conclusion,  xxxd3135xxx  is an effective drug for the acute treatment of moderate or severe migraine. oral  xxxd3135xxx  5 and 10mg have shown greater efficacy
than placebo in providing pain relief, an absence of pain, relief from associated
symptoms, normal functional ability and an improvement in patient quality of

life. earlier results showed that  xxxd3135xxx  provides faster freedom from pain and
reduces nausea to a greater extent than oral sumatriptan. more recent studies have
shown that  xxxd3135xxx  10mg provides faster pain relief and a higher percentage
of patients with an absence of pain and normal functional ability at 2 hours than
naratriptan 2.5mg or  xxxd3562xxx  2.5mg. the efficacy of  xxxd3135xxx  is retained
when used in the long term, and the drug is generally well tolerated. although
well designed studies comparing  xxxd3135xxx  with almotriptan,  xxxd1976xxx  and
frovatriptan would further define the position of  xxxd3135xxx , current data suggest
that  xxxd3135xxx  should be considered as a first-line treatment option in the management of migraine.

1. pharmacodynamic profile
 xxxd3135xxx  is an orally active serotonin 5-ht1
receptor agonist that potently and selectively binds
to  xxxg1109xxx /1d subtypes.[1,2]
 xxxd3135xxx , sumatriptan and  xxxd3562xxx  induce vasoconstriction and reduce (albeit to a different extent) compliance of conduit arteries, suggesting that  xxxg1109xxx /1d agonists should be used
with caution in patients with an increased risk for
cardiovascular events.[3] in a double-blind study in
16 patients with migraine,  xxxd3135xxx , sumatriptan
and  xxxd3562xxx  caused similar decreases in the
diameter of the carotid and brachial arteries (by
about 4–10%); there were no significant differences between active treatments. distension, vascular resistance and isobaric cross-sectional compliance of the carotid artery were not affected by
any of the active drugs. unlike sumatriptan or
 xxxd3562xxx ,  xxxd3135xxx  did not significantly affect
isobaric compliance of the brachial artery.  xxxd3135xxx  had no effect on the diameter or vascular
resistance of the temporal artery.[3]
 xxxd3135xxx  generally produces only small and
transient increases in blood pressure and does not
affect heart rate or the increases in heart rate or blood
pressure in response to sympathetic stimulation.[4-7]
however,  xxxd3135xxx  is contraindicated in patients
with uncontrolled hypertension (section 5).
in guinea pigs, intravenous  xxxd3135xxx  0.01–1
mg/kg dose-dependently inhibited electrically stimulated neurogenic dural vasodilation, but had no
effect on rat-alpha-calcitonin gene-related peptide
(alphacgrp)–induced vasodilation, indicating that
 xxxd3135xxx  has an inhibitory action on the release

of cgrp via an action at receptors located on the
trigeminal sensory fibres.[8]
in rats, intravenous  xxxd3135xxx  100 and 1000
mug/kg inhibited dural plasma protein extravasation
induced by electrical stimulation of the trigeminal
ganglion (by about 57 and 89%).  xxxd3135xxx  inhibited electrically induced central nociceptive neurotransmission, suggesting a central antinociceptive
effect.[9]
 xxxd3135xxx  20–60mg does not affect serum prolactin concentrations, and produces transient increases in growth hormone concentrations similar
to those seen after sumatriptan 100mg.[4]
2. pharmacokinetic profile
the bioavailability of  xxxd3135xxx  after oral administration is about 45%.[10,11] maximum plasma
concentration (cmax) and area under the plasma
concentration-time curve (auc) values for  xxxd3135xxx  were generally dose proportional after singledose  xxxd3135xxx  5–60mg.[4] studies evaluating single-dose  xxxd3135xxx  10mg in healthy volunteers
showed cmax and auc values of between 17.7 and
32.1 mug/l and 49.6 and 97.0 mug • h/l, respectively.
the mean time to achieve cmax (tmax) was 0.7–1.5
hours after  xxxd3135xxx  10mg; the elimination halflife (t1⁄2) was 1.7–2.6 hours.[4,6,10-15]
after multiple-dose  xxxd3135xxx  (10mg every 2
hours for three doses on 4 consecutive days), the
auc was approximately 3-fold higher, cmax was
2-fold higher and tmax was 5-fold higher than after
single-dose  xxxd3135xxx  10mg; t1⁄2 and the rate of
renal clearance (clr) were not significantly affected.[6]
cns drugs 2002; 16 (10)

spotlight on  xxxd3135xxx 

cmax, auc, tmax and t1⁄2 values after single-dose
 xxxd3135xxx  10mg in healthy elderly volunteers
(aged between 65 and 78 years) were similar to
those found in younger adults; however, clr was
somewhat lower in the elderly (11.8 vs 17.6 l/h).[16]
 xxxd3135xxx  is predominantly metabolised by
 xxxg1357xxx  (mao-a) in the liver;[16]
the major metabolites are triazolomethyl- xxxd2348xxx  and  xxxd3135xxx -n-oxide (both inactive).[6,13]
the minor metabolite n-monodesmethyl- xxxd3135xxx 
is active at  xxxg1109xxx /1d receptors. 82.4 and 15.2% of
an administered dose of  xxxd3135xxx  10mg is excreted in the urine and faeces, predominantly
within the first 24 hours.[6]
coadministration of  xxxd3135xxx  with moclobemide (which is contraindicated) or propranolol
(but not  xxxd2689xxx  or metoprolol) causes an increase
in plasma concentrations of  xxxd3135xxx ;[10,15] patients receiving propranolol should be prescribed
 xxxd3135xxx  5mg (section 5). results from a study
in women taking oral contraceptives showed that
 xxxd3135xxx  has no effect on the pharmacokinetics
of  xxxd2054xxx  or  xxxd2751xxx  ( xxxd2751xxx ).[17]
3. therapeutic efficacy
the efficacy of  xxxd3135xxx  (standard tablets and
orally disintegrating tablets [wafers]) in the treatment of migraine has been demonstrated in large,
well designed, placebo-controlled studies and
comparative trials with oral sumatriptan,  xxxd3562xxx  and naratriptan.[18-26]
earlier comparative studies with sumatriptan
demonstrated that at 2 hours postdose,  xxxd3135xxx 
5 and 10mg were more effective than sumatriptan
25 and 100mg, respectively, at producing a painfree state, and that  xxxd3135xxx  5mg was more effective than sumatriptan 25mg at providing pain relief.  xxxd3135xxx  10mg has also been shown to be
more effective than  xxxd3135xxx  5mg at providing
freedom from pain within 2 hours of the dose.[21,22,24]
more recent randomised, double-blind, placebocontrolled studies showed that more patients who
received  xxxd3135xxx  10mg for the acute treatment
of a single migraine attack were free of pain 2

hours postdose than patients who received  xxxd3562xxx  2.5mg or naratriptan 2.5mg.[25,26] compared with  xxxd3562xxx  recipients, more  xxxd3135xxx  recipients had pain relief after 1 hour (but not
at 2 hours). compared with naratriptan recipients,
more patients who received  xxxd3135xxx  were pain
free or had pain relief from 1 hour onwards. patients were more likely to be free of pain or experience faster pain relief with  xxxd3135xxx  than with
naratriptan (odds ratios [ors] 2.68 and 1.62) but
not with  xxxd3562xxx  (1.26 and 1.22).[25,26]
in the earlier comparative studies with sumatriptan, 32–48% of patients receiving  xxxd3135xxx  5
or 10mg were functioning normally 2 hours postdose, compared with 33–43% of sumatriptan 25,
50 or 100mg recipients.[21,22,24] in one trial,[22]
more patients who received  xxxd3135xxx  10mg had
normal functional ability at 2 hours than those who
received sumatriptan 100mg or  xxxd3135xxx  5mg.
the effects of  xxxd3135xxx  5 and 10mg at 2 hours on
most migraine associated symptoms, except nausea, were similar to the respective comparative
doses of sumatriptan.[21,22] the incidence of nausea at 2 hours was lower after  xxxd3135xxx  5 and
10mg than after sumatriptan 100mg in one study.[22]
in another trial,[21] the incidence of nausea at 2
hours was lower when  xxxd3135xxx  5mg was compared with sumatriptan 25mg, but not when  xxxd3135xxx  10mg was compared with sumatriptan
50mg.
in more recent studies,[25,26] the number of patients with normal functional ability at 2 hours was
higher after  xxxd3135xxx  than after naratriptan or
 xxxd3562xxx . compared with  xxxd3562xxx ,  xxxd3135xxx  was associated with a lower incidence of
nausea or photophobia at 2 hours.  xxxd3135xxx  was
associated with a lower incidence of photophobia
or phonophobia than naratriptan at 2 hours. the
incidence of migraine recurrence within 24 hours
of the initial dose was similar among patients
treated with  xxxd3135xxx  or  xxxd3562xxx , but lower
with naratriptan.[25,26] a retrospective analysis of
five double-blind trials concluded that  xxxd3135xxx 
10mg was more effective than oral sumatriptan 25,
50 or 100mg or naratriptan 2.5mg, but not zolcns drugs 2002; 16 (10)

mitriptan 2.5mg, at eliminating nausea within 2
hours of a migraine attack in patients with nausea
at baseline.[27] in another retrospective analysis of
five clinical trials that compared the same treatment regimens, more  xxxd3135xxx  recipients had a
24-hour sustained pain-free response than patients
who received sumatriptan 25 or 50mg, naratriptan
or  xxxd3562xxx . although 24-hour sustained painfree rates were higher in  xxxd3135xxx  recipients than
in sumatriptan 100mg recipients, the difference did
not achieve statistical significance.[28]
in a large noncomparative trial involving 25 501
evaluable patients who treated up to three attacks,
the proportion of patients who reported feeling the
first effects (a definition of pain relief was not provided) of  xxxd3135xxx  within 30 minutes during the
first and third attacks was 32.3 and 43.9%. corresponding values for pain relief between 30 minutes
and 1 hour were 43.1 and 38.5%.[29]
the efficacy of  xxxd3135xxx  was not affected by
long-term administration. in a nonblind extension
study, 458 patients with migraine treated multiple
attacks (a total of 8229) with  xxxd3135xxx  5 or 10mg
or usual therapy (85% of patients in the usual therapy group used sumatriptan [dose not specified]
either alone or in combination with other agents to
treat most of the attacks [77%]) over a 6-month
period. the median percentage of attacks in which
 xxxd3135xxx  10mg recipients reported pain relief or
an absence of pain 2 hours after the dose was 82
and 46%; corresponding values among recipients
of  xxxd3135xxx  5mg (72 and 25%) or usual therapy
(73 and 30%) were lower. ors showed  xxxd3135xxx 
10mg was more likely to provide pain relief or an
absence of pain at 2 hours than  xxxd3135xxx  5mg
(1.60 and 1.93) or usual therapy (1.63 and 1.50).[30]
in a meta-analysis of 53 double-blind clinical
trials (involving  xxxd3135xxx , sumatriptan,  xxxd1976xxx , almotriptan,  xxxd3562xxx  and naratriptan),
 xxxd3135xxx  10mg,  xxxd1976xxx  80mg and  xxxd3562xxx 
2.5mg were better at providing  xxxd234xxx 
within 2 hours than sumatriptan 100mg, against
which all the triptans were compared. although
headache recurrence rates were higher with  xxxd3135xxx  5 or 10mg than with sumatriptan 100mg,

24-hour sustained pain-free rates were higher with
 xxxd3135xxx  10mg, almotriptan 12.5mg and  xxxd1976xxx  80mg than with sumatriptan 100mg.[31] in
an analysis of multiple-attack studies (data were
not available for  xxxd3135xxx  5mg, sumatriptan 25
or 50mg or  xxxd3562xxx  2.5 or 5mg),  xxxd3135xxx 
10mg was shown to provide the highest consistent
therapeutic response when compared with sumatriptan 100mg.[31]
in another meta-analysis of 28 clinical trials, in
which the primary efficacy variable analysed was
the proportion of patients who were pain free at 2
hours,  xxxd3135xxx  10mg was the only  xxxd3263xxx  associated with a higher therapeutic gain than oral
sumatriptan 100mg, against which all the studied
triptans (oral sumatriptan 50mg,  xxxd3562xxx  2.5
or 5mg, naratriptan 2.5mg,  xxxd1976xxx  20, 40 or
80mg or almotriptan 12.5mg) were compared.[32]
two retrospective analyses have demonstrated
that  xxxd3135xxx  is effective in the treatment of menstrual migraine (i.e. migraine that is exacerbated
around the time of menses).[33,34]  xxxd3135xxx  5 and
10mg were more effective than placebo at relieving a single migraine attack that occurred within 3
days of menstruation according to a retrospective
subgroup analysis of two double-blind studies.[33]
furthermore, a retrospective analysis of a longterm extension study showed  xxxd3135xxx  10mg to
be as effective in the treatment of multiple menstrually associated migraine attacks as it was in the
treatment of multiple nonmenstrual attacks.[34]
4. tolerability
 xxxd3135xxx  is generally well tolerated and adverse events are usually mild and transient. earlier
studies, as reviewed elsewhere,[35] showed that the
incidence of drug-related adverse events in patients who received  xxxd3135xxx  5 or 10mg or oral
sumatriptan 25 or 50mg were similar, but lower
with both doses of  xxxd3135xxx  than with sumatriptan 100mg; these studies also showed that the
most common adverse events associated with
 xxxd3135xxx  were cns or gastrointestinal related.
more recent studies showed that  xxxd3135xxx 
10mg was also well tolerated in the two doublecns drugs 2002; 16 (10)

spotlight on  xxxd3135xxx 

blind trials with  xxxd3562xxx  and naratriptan.[25,26]
the most common adverse events associated with
 xxxd3135xxx ,  xxxd3562xxx  or naratriptan were cns
or gastrointestinal related, and included asthenia/
fatigue, dizziness, somnolence and nausea. these
adverse events were, however, reported by relatively small percentages of patients (≤8%). there
was a trend towards a lower incidence of adverse
events with  xxxd3135xxx  compared with  xxxd3562xxx 
(31.2 vs 38.8%). however,  xxxd3135xxx  was associated with a higher incidence of adverse events than
naratriptan (39 vs 29%).
 xxxd3135xxx  10mg was well tolerated in a large
noncomparative study in 33 147 patients who
treated up to three moderate or severe migraine
attacks. 304 patients (0.9%) reported at least one
adverse event. the most frequent were dizziness,
asthenia/fatigue and nausea, which occurred in
0.21, 0.17 and 0.11% of patients, respectively.[29]
in the two recent double-blind studies,[25,26] the
incidence of chest pain (a feeling of tightness or
pressure in the chest) was similar after the administration of  xxxd3135xxx ,  xxxd3562xxx  or naratriptan
(2–4%). in the noncomparative study in 33 147 patients, chest pain was reported by only 0.05% of
patients.[29]
the incidence of adverse events (whether related to treatment or not) among patients who received  xxxd3135xxx  5 or 10mg or usual therapy for
the treatment of multiple migraine attacks over a
6-month period was similar (53, 60 and 66%, respectively). the incidence of adverse events thought
to be drug related was higher after  xxxd3135xxx  10mg
than after  xxxd3135xxx  5mg (31 vs 20%) but similar
to that after usual therapy (26%).[30]
5. dosage and administration
 xxxd3135xxx  is indicated for the treatment of migraine with or without aura in adults. it is available
in 5 or 10mg doses in standard tablet form or as
orally disintegrating tablets (wafers).[11]
the recommended initial dose is 5 or 10mg, and
dose selection should be made on a per patient basis. if required, additional doses for headache recurrence should be separated by at least 2 hours;

no more than 30mg should be taken during a 24hour period. the use of  xxxd3135xxx  for the treatment of more than four migraines in a 30-day period has not been established. dose adjustments
based solely on age are not considered necessary
in elderly patients.[11]
 xxxd3135xxx , like all  xxxg1109xxx /1d receptor agonists, is contraindicated in patients with ischaemic
heart disease, any other significant underlying cardiovascular disease, uncontrolled hypertension or
hemiplegic or basilar migraine. it should be used
with caution in patients on dialysis, with moderate
hepatic impairment or reporting signs or symptoms of angina.[11]
coadministration of  xxxd3135xxx  with mao inhibitors (within 2 weeks), ergot derivatives or other
 xxxg1109xxx /1d receptor agonists (within 24 hours) is
contraindicated. coadministration with propranolol increases plasma concentrations of  xxxd3135xxx 
by 75%; therefore, patients receiving propranolol
should be prescribed  xxxd3135xxx  5mg. observation
of patients is advised if  xxxd3135xxx  is coadministered with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, as symptoms of the serotonin syndrome have
been reported.[11]
