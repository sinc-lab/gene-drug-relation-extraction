abstract. objective: to investigate anti-inflammatory effects of  xxxd2508xxx  in vitro on cox-1/cox-2, on no formation from inos and on the formation of the pro-inflammatory cytokines  xxxg2296xxx , il-1b, il-6, and il-8.
materials and methods: cox-1 inhibition in intact cells was
assessed employing two systems: measurement of aggregation in human washed platelets and assessment of txb2 formation in hel cells. cox-2 inhibition was assessed by measuring 6-keto-pgf1a in supernatants of intact cells of lpsstimulated j774.2 cells (murine) and of mono mac 6 cells
(human). in whole blood inhibition of cox-1 was performed
by measuring txb2 formation after clotting, and cox-2
inhibition was examined in lps-stimulated whole blood cultures. the reduction of no levels as a measure of the inhibition of cellular no formation was assayed in supernatants of
lps-stimulated raw 264.7 cells using the griess reaction.
compound influence on the formation of  xxxg2296xxx , il-1b,  xxxg1181xxx , and il-8 was examined using lps-stimulated monocytic
cells (thp-1) and measurement of cytokine concentrations
by specific elisas.
results: in intact human cells,  xxxd2508xxx  showed a balanced
inhibition of cox-1/-2 exhibiting the lowest ic50
(0.005 mm/0.008 mm) of the large panel of nsaids tested.
similar results were obtained in the whole blood for cox1/-2. no formation was dose-dependently inhibited by
 xxxd2508xxx  (ic50 of 65 mm) whereas  xxxd2969xxx , diclofenac,
ibuprofen, ketorolac and naproxen inhibited the no formation markedly less. indomethacin was approximately equipotent with  xxxd2508xxx . in stimulated monocytic cells (thp-

1),  xxxd2508xxx  showed a marked inhibition of il-6 formation
(ic50 54 mm) while the formation of  xxxg2296xxx , il-1b and il-8
was only moderately affected.
conclusions: of the panel of nsaids tested,  xxxd2508xxx  was
found to be the most potent balanced inhibitor of human
cox-1/-2. the equipotent cox-isoenzyme inhibition by
 xxxd2508xxx  is complemented by a marked inhibition of il-6
production and of inos-derived no formation. the in vitro
activities described support the marked anti-inflammatory
and analgesic activities of  xxxd2508xxx  found in animal
models as well as in clinical studies.
key words:  xxxd2508xxx  – cox-1 – cox-2 – prostaglandin
– il-6 – inos – cytokines
introduction
 xxxd2508xxx  ( xxxd2508xxx ) is a novel non-steroidal antiinflammatory drug (nsaid) of the  xxxd3311xxx  class of nsaids.
 xxxd2508xxx  is distinguished from established oxicams by its
short plasma half life (3–5 h) [1] and good gastrointestinal
tolerability [2]. as with other nsaids the principle mechanism of action of  xxxd2508xxx  relates to the inhibition of
cyclooxygenase (cox), the key enzyme of the arachidonic
acid pathway, resulting in the inhibition of prostaglandin
(pg) synthesis [3–5]. thus, in rat polymorphonuclear
leukocytes  xxxd2508xxx  potently inhibited the formation of
 xxxg1073xxx  in vitro (ic50 20 nm) [1]. in vivo  xxxd2508xxx  exhibited
anti-inflammatory activities in acute (carrageenan-induced
paw oedema) as well as in chronic inflammation (adjuvantinduced arthritis) that were more potently than the ones of
other oxicams. in addition  xxxd2508xxx  showed effective antinociception in the acetylcholine induced writhing test in
mice [1].
the in vivo anti-inflammatory and anti-nociceptive properties of  xxxd2508xxx  were also observed in clinical trials.
 xxxd2508xxx  effectively relieved the symptoms of osteoar-

370

thritis, rheumatoid arthritis and  xxxg1055xxx  (for
review see [6]) [7, 8]. strong analgesic effects of  xxxd2508xxx  were also observed after dental surgery, hysterectomy,
lumbar disk surgery and in controlling lower back pain
[9–12].
the surprisingly strong analgesia found initiated further
pre-clinical studies. one recent study in a model of carrageenan-induced inflammatory nociception demonstrated
reduction of the number of activated neurones at that level of
the spinal cord that related to the inflamed extremity [13].
the type of neurones affected was suggestive of a predominantly peripheral site of analgesic activity of  xxxd2508xxx  in
this model.
as mentioned above one principal mechanism of action
of nsaids relies on the inhibition of cox which is the rate
limiting enzyme in the  xxxd208xxx  pathway [14]. cox
exists in two isoforms, cox-1 and cox-2 (for reviews see
[15, 16]). while cox-1 is thought to account for homeostatic amounts of eicosanoids, cox-2 is induced during
inflammation leading to the formation of pathologic amounts
of prostaglandins. the inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis
by nsaids has been demonstrated to effectively reduce
inflammatory symptoms such as oedema and pain [16–18].
however, this does not satisfactorily explain all the nsaids’
analgesic effects. other mediators of inflammation such as
reactive oxygen products and cytokines have also been
shown to considerably contribute to inflammation and
inflammatory pain [19, 20]. so, concurrently to the transcriptional induction of the cox-2 gene, the expression of the
gene encoding  xxxg1578xxx  (inos) is
induced, leading to increased levels of  xxxd2738xxx  (no) in
inflamed tissues [21]. in these, no has been shown to contribute to oedema formation, hyperalgesia and pain [20, 22].
pro-inflammatory cytokines such as cytokines  xxxg2296xxx  (tnf)-a, interleukin (il)-1b, il-6 and il-8 are
interlinked with the formation of small molecular mediators
of inflammation and thus contribute to the range of mediators
that critically control inflammation [23, 24]. the effects of
those pro-inflammatory cytokines have been demonstrated
by the marked clinical improvements in recipients of anticytokine therapies with monoclonal antibodies directed to
 xxxg2296xxx  [25], with soluble il-1 receptor [26], anti-il-6 monoclonal antibodies [27], or in in vivo experiments with monoclonal antibodies to il-8 [24].
to gain further insights into the mechanism(s) of action
of  xxxd2508xxx , we investigated in vitro effects of  xxxd2508xxx 
on human cox-1 and human cox-2, on inos, and on the
formation of the pro-inflammatory cytokines  xxxg2296xxx , il-1b,
il-6, and il-8. in order to arrive at in vitro conditions that
closely resemble the in vivo situation, intact cell assays or
whole blood assays were employed throughout the investigations.

kind gift from dr. d. binder, university of vienna, vienna, austria.
the compounds were dissolved in dmso, serially diluted in
dmso and added to the assays described below. the final concentration of dmso was kept constant at 1 %, which did not affect the formation of any of the mediators measured. controls treated with vehicle
only were always run in parallel.

cell culture
hel 92.1.7 cells, raw 264.7 cells, thp-1 cells (atcc, rockville md,
usa) and j774.2 cells (ecacc, salisbury, uk) were grown in rpmi
1640 medium (gibco-brl, vienna, austria) supplemented with 10 %
foetal calf serum (fcs), sodium pyruvate (1 mm), glutamine (2 mm),
penicillin (100 u/ml), streptomycin (100 mg/ml).
the mono mac 6 cell line was provided by dr. h.w.l. zieglerheitbrock, university of munich [28]. these cells were initially subcloned and the clone with the highest cox-2 protein expression (mono
mac 6.x2) used as source for cox-2 [29]. the cells were grown in 1 ml
cultures using 24 well plates (greiner, kremsmünster, austria) in rpmi
1640 medium supplemented with 10 % fcs tested for low endotoxin
content, sodium pyruvate (1 mm), glutamine (2 mm), penicillin
(100 u/ml), streptomycin (100 mg/ml), oxalacetic acid (1 mm), nonessential amino acids (2x), and bovine insulin (9 mg/ml).
for stimulation experiments lps from e. coli, serotype 026:b6
(sigma) was used throughout the study.

assessment of cox-1 activity in human platelets
informed consent was obtained from both male and female healthy volunteers (10 individuals, age of 25 to 35) that had not taken any drugs
within the previous 2 weeks. blood was drawn into vacutainer tubes
(9 volumes (vol.) blood and 1 vol. 0.129 m citrate) and centrifuged at
450 g for 4 min at room temperature (rt) to obtain platelet rich plasma
(prp). about 4 vol, prp was mixed with 1 vol. 0.129 m citrate (ph 6.5)
and centrifuged at 250 g for 10 min. then, the platelets were resuspended in hepes buffer (145 mm nacl, 5 mm kcl, 1 mm  xxxd2534xxx , 10 mm
hepes and 0.05 u/ml hirudin; ph 7.4) and adjusted to about 3 ¥
108/ml. platelets (200 ml) were incubated in a dual channel aggregometer cuvette for 4 min at 37 °c. fibrinogen, 25 ml, (1 mg/ml final
conc.) and 2.5 ml compound were added and incubated with stirring at
1000 rpm for 2 min. then, 25 ml  xxxd208xxx  (10 mm final conc.)
was added and aggregation was monitored for 4 min. maximum aggregation obtained during monitoring was taken as 100 %.

assessment of cox-2 activity in j774.2 cells
the inhibition of cox-2 activity in the murine monocytic j774.2 cells
was assessed as previously described with minor modifications [30].
briefly, j774.2 cells were stimulated with lps (10 mg/ml) for 16 h.
after exchange of the culture medium, compounds were added for
30 min at 37 °c. then,  xxxd208xxx  (sigma) was added to a final
concentration of 30 mm for a further 15 min at 37 °c. thereafter, 6-keto
prostaglandin f1a (pgf1a) was assessed in cell free culture supernatants
by elisa (cayman) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.

materials and methods
compounds
test compounds were obtained from the following sources:  xxxd2508xxx ,
tenidap and  xxxd3311xxx  (nycomed pharma, linz, austria); aspirin, diclofenac, ibuprofen, indomethacin, naproxen,  xxxd2969xxx  (sigma, munich,

the inhibition of cox-1 activity in intact cells was assessed as previously described [31]. briefly, cells of the human erythroleukemic cell
line hel were harvested, suspended in fresh medium (106/ml) and incubated with compound for 30 min at 37 °c. then,  xxxd208xxx 
(30 mm; sigma) was added for 15 min at 37 °c. thereafter, thromboxane b2 (txb2) was assessed in cell free culture supernatants by elisa
according to the manufacturer’s instructions.

assessment of human cox-2 activity in intact cells
inhibition of cox-2 was performed as previously described [31]. mono
mac 6 cells (106/ml) were cultured in 24-well plates for 6 h in the presence of 100 ng/ml lps. the culture medium was renewed and compound was added for 30 min at 37 °c. then,  xxxd208xxx  (30 mm;

of four washes p- xxxd2822xxx  (1 mg/ml) (sigma) dissolved in
substrate buffer (9.7 % (v/v) diethanolamine (sigma) in bi-distilled
h2o, 4 mm mgcl2, ph 9.8) was added and colour development was
assessed with a microplate reader (v-max spectrophotometer, molecular
devices) at l 405 nm. reference measurements were performed at l
650 nm. the concentrations of cytokines were calculated using standard
curves for each cytokine that were generated with purified human
recombinant cytokines ( xxxg2296xxx , il-1b, and il-6 from r & d systems,
oxon, uk; il-8 from genzyme, cambridge, ma, usa). the sensitivity for each elisa was 10 pg/ml.

assessment of cox-1 activity in whole blood
whole blood was drawn from healthy donors (same panel of volunteers
as above) by veinipuncture after informed consent had been obtained.
the donors had not taken any drugs the previous two weeks. the blood
(100 ml) was immediately mixed with graded amounts of compound or
vehicle and incubated for 1 h at 37 °c as described by patrigniani and
colleagues [32]. thereafter, serum was obtained by centrifugation at
1200 g, 4 °c for 10 min and assayed for txb2 by elisa according to
the manufacturer’s instructions.

assessment of cox-2 activity in whole blood
heparinized blood was collected from the same volunteers as for cox1 assessment. about 100 ml were incubated with lps (10 mg/ml),  xxxd234xxx  (10 mg/ml) (sigma) and compound for 24 h at 37 °c as
described [32]. then, plasma was obtained by centrifugation at 1200 g,
4 °c for 10 min and assayed for pge2 by elisa according to the manufacturer’s instructions.

assessment of  xxxg1578xxx  mediated no
accumulation
raw 264.7 cells were suspended in culture medium without phenol red
(gibco-brl, vienna, austria) and adjusted to 106/ml. then, the cells
were incubated with graded amounts of compound and with or without
lps (2 mg/ml) for 24 h at 37 °c as described previously [33]. thereafter, culture supernatants were removed and accumulated  xxxd2738xxx ,
as a measure of no synthase activity was assessed in cell-free culture
supernatants by the griess-reaction [34]. to 100 ml culture supernatant
100 ml griess reagent (1% sulphanilamide and 0.1% naphthylethylenediamine in 5% phosphoric acid) was added and colour development was
assessed at l 550 nm with a microplate reader (v-max spectrophotometer, molecular devices, munich, germany). standard curves were
generated with a serial dilution of sodium nitrite dissolved in culture
medium. the sensitivity of the assay was 0.5 mm.

assessment of il-6 steady-state mrna levels
we used rt-pcr to quantify il-6 steady-state mrna levels. rna was
isolated [35] and amounts were determined by measuring the absorbency at l 260 nm. rt-pcr was performed using the geneamp rna pcr
kit (perkin-elmer corporation, vaterstetten, germany) applying 1 mg
rna to synthesise oligo(dt)16-primed cdna. the cdna was normalised using b-actin specific primers (5¢-atc tgg cac cac acc ttg
tac aat gag ctg cg-3¢ and 5¢-cgt cat act cct gct tgc
tga tcc aca tct gc-3¢) and pcr-mimics (pcr-mimic-kit and
rt-pcr amplimer set for il-6 clontech, palo alto, ca, usa) according to the manufacturer’s instruction. then, b-actin and il-6 specific
pcr was performed applying equal amounts of the normalised cdna.
the sequences of the il-6 specific oligonucleotide primers were 5¢atg aac tcc ttc tcc aca agc gc-3¢ and 5¢-gaa gag ccc
tca ggc tgg act g-3¢. the 50 ml pcr mixtures comprised 0.4 mm
primer (clontech, palo alto, ca, usa) 0.2 mm dntps, 1.5 mm
mgcl2, 10 mm tris hcl ph 8.3, 50 mm kcl, 2 u amplitaq dna polymerase. after an initial step of 94 °c for 5 min, amplification was performed by 35 cycles at 94 °c for 45 s, 60 °c for 45 s, 72 °c for 2 min
followed by a final extension of 7 min at 72 °c. the pcr products
(8 ml/lane) were resolved on 1.5 % agarose gels and visualised by staining with ethidium bromide (sigma, munich, germany). the b-actin and
il-6 specific pcr generated fragments of 838 bp and 628 bp, respectively.

data analysis
results of 3 or more independent experiments each performed in triplicates were calculated as mean ± sd of percent eicosanoid formation,
no and cytokine levels relative to control (dmso vehicle). the ic50
values were calculated either by sigmoidal curve fitting [36], or by logarithmic-linear regression analysis using values in the range of 20 % to
80%.

results
assessment of the formation of  xxxg2296xxx , il-1b, il-6, and il-8
thp-1 cells (0.8 ¥ 105/ml) were incubated with compound for 10 min
at room temperature. then, cells were cultured for 15h at 37 °c with or
without lps (5 mg/ml ). thereafter,  xxxg2296xxx , il-1b, il-6 and il-8 were
assessed in cell free culture supernatants by capture elisas specific for
the respected human cytokines as previously described [29]. briefly, 96
well plates (nunc, vienna, austria) were coated with mouse monoclonal antibody directed to the respective cytokine ( xxxg2296xxx , il-1b, il-6
and il-8 (r&d systems, oxon, uk) and blocked with bsa. cell-free
culture supernatants serially diluted in pbs containing 0.1% bsa,
0.05 % tween 20 and 0.02% nan3 were added to the plates and incubated overnight at 4 °c. thereafter, the plates were washed four times with
pbst (pbs with 0.05% tween 20 and 0.1% nan3). goat antibodies
directed to the respective cytokines (r&d systems, oxon, uk) were
added and after extensive washing followed by alkaline phosphataseconjugated donkey f(ab¢)2 to goat immunoglobulin (jackson immuno

effects of  xxxd2508xxx  on  xxxg1883xxx /-2 activity
in intact cells
to assess the effects of  xxxd2508xxx  on both cox isoenzymes
separately intact cell assays specific for cox-1 and cox-2
were used.
in a first set of experiments,  xxxd2508xxx ’s inhibitory
potency on cox-1 and cox-2 was assessed using  xxxd208xxx -induced platelet aggregation for cox-1. for
cox-2 assessment, we used the lps-stimulated mouse
macrophage cells j774.2 which have been shown to display
only cox-2 [30]. from these cells, the production of pgf1a
was measured. as presented in table 1,  xxxd2508xxx  effectively inhibited the aggregation of human platelets as well as
the formation of pgf1a in that cox-1 was nine-fold more

comparison, showed similar preferential cox-1 inhibition as
 xxxd2508xxx  with the exception of indomethacin and tenidap
which inhibited cox-1 about 15-fold and 20-fold more
potently than cox-2.  xxxd2508xxx ’s inhibitory activity on
cox-1 and cox-2 was about 30-fold greater than of the
other oxicams  xxxd2969xxx  and  xxxd3311xxx . of the nsaids
tested,  xxxd2508xxx  showed the lowest ic50 value on both
isoenzymes (table 1).
in a second set of experiments  xxxd2508xxx ’s inhibitory
potency was examined in two almost identical assays using
different human cell types specific for cox-1 or cox-2.
 xxxd2508xxx  dose-dependently inhibited txb2 formation in
hel cells and pgf1a-formation in lps-stimulated mono
mac 6 cells (fig. 1). both cox isoenzymes were inhibited
almost equipotently, with ic50 values of 0.003 mm for cox1 and of 0.008 mm for cox-2. the maximum inhibition of

cox-1 was observed  xxxd1891xxx  mm, resulting in 98% inhibition
of txb2 formation. for cox-2, maximum inhibition was
obtained at 1 mm yielding 94% reduction of the pgf1a production. thus  xxxd2508xxx  appears to be an nsaid exhibiting
strong and equipotent cox-1/-2 inhibition.
for comparison, other nsaids were tested in parallel
(table 2).  xxxd2969xxx  and  xxxd3311xxx  inhibited cox-1 approximately 100 times less potently than  xxxd2508xxx . on cox-2
 xxxd2508xxx  was about 4 times more potent than  xxxd3311xxx 
and about 70 times more potent than  xxxd2969xxx . the other
nsaids, with the exception of  xxxd1873xxx , were also less
potent than  xxxd2508xxx  on both cox isoenzymes. with the
exception of  xxxd2561xxx , which showed a 14-fold greater selectivity for cox-2, the other nsaids were either equipotent
cox-1/-2 inhibitors, like  xxxd2508xxx , or were more selective
for cox-1 (table 2).

allowed to clot. serum concentrations of txb2 (open symbols) were

was incubated with heparinized blood together with lps (10 mg) for
24 h. plasma concentrations of pge2 (closed symbols) were measured
by elisa. values are presented as mean ± sd of the percentage of

in whole blood

effects of  xxxd2508xxx  on the formation of  xxxg2296xxx , il-1b,

in whole blood,  xxxd2508xxx  inhibited cox-1-derived txb2
and cox-2-derived pge2 dose dependently resulting in
almost identical inhibition curves (fig. 2). this was also
reflected by identical ic50 values of 0.13 mm for both cox
isoenzymes. at 3 mm  xxxd2508xxx  inhibited both cox isoenzymes completely. indomethacin showed approximately
equal inhibitory activities on both cox isoenzymes, whereas
 xxxd2561xxx  and ketorolac were slightly cox-2 selective
(table 3). thus,  xxxd2508xxx  showed potent and balanced
cox-1/-2 inhibition in whole blood.

we next investigated whether  xxxd2508xxx  affected the production of the pro-inflammatory cytokines  xxxg2296xxx , il-1b,
il-6 and the chemokine il-8 during lps-stimulation of the

were approximately three times less potent than  xxxd2508xxx .
ketorolac, ibuprofen and naproxen inhibited no formation

in parallel. the results are presented in table 5.  xxxd2508xxx 
dose dependently inhibited the il-6 formation with an ic50
value of 54 mm (fig. 3 and table 5). at 300 mm 89% inhibition of il-6 secretion was observed. the production of  xxxg2296xxx , il-1b and il-8 was only slightly affected. at the highest
concentrations used (300 mm)  xxxd2508xxx  showed a weak
stimulation of  xxxg2296xxx  , il-1b and il-8 production.
 xxxd2969xxx  also inhibited the il-6 production, albeit to a
lesser extent, not significantly and not strictly concentration
dependently. at the concentrations tested, a complete inhibition of il-6 formation was not obtained. with an ic50 of
approximately 470 mm  xxxd2969xxx ’s inhibitory activity was
found to be at least one order of magnitude lesser than that of
 xxxd2508xxx .  xxxg2296xxx  production was slightly increased by
 xxxd2969xxx  at the highest concentration (134% of control at
300 mm), whereas the production of il-1b and il-8 was not

affected (table 5). cellular toxic effect by the compounds
were monitored by measuring the concentration of lactate
dehydrogenase (ldh) in the culture supernatants in parallel.
the concentration of ldh were not increased in any of the
experiments (data not shown).
effects of  xxxd2508xxx  on il-6 mrna steady state levels
rt-pcr was performed to examine whether  xxxd2508xxx ’s
il-6 inhibitory activity was related to the inhibition of il-6
gene transcription (fig. 4). thp-1 cells were incubated with
vehicle (dmso) or with lps in combination with vehicle
and dexamethasone, or  xxxd2508xxx , or  xxxd2969xxx . the isolated rna was transcribed into cdna. using b-actin specific primers the cdna together with a b-actin mimic competitor template was amplified to quantify b-actin specific
cdna. then, about 0.12 attomole-eqivalents of b-actin
cdna were amplified with b-actin specific primers (fig. 4a)
or interleukin-6 specific primers (fig. 4b). figure 4b shows
that the il-6 mrna steady state level is increased by lps
(upper panel, lane 2), and that this increase is completely
inhibited by 10 nm of dexamethasone (upper panel, lane 3).
 xxxd2508xxx  or  xxxd2969xxx  did not affect the il-6 mrna
steady state levels detectably (fig. 4b, lanes 4 and 5). this
finding suggests that  xxxd2508xxx  does not act on the level of
induction and transcription of the il-6 gene but points to an
inhibition of one of the post transcriptional or translation processes of il-6 production as a possible mechanism of action.

nsaids reduce pain and swelling in inflamed tissues. their
mechanism of action is at least shared by the inhibition of
prostaglandin synthesis which is mediated by the enzyme
cox [37, 38]. cox exists in two isoforms, cox-1 and
cox-2, each with distinct expression pattern in various cell
types [39–42]. this is thought to reflect distinct functions.
thus, cox-1 has been suggested to provide a physiologic
level of prostaglandins for normal platelet, stomach and kidney function. in contrast, cox-2 has been found to be high-

ly induced at inflammatory sites in animals [43–46] as well
as in patients with inflammatory diseases [47]. hence, cox2 is considered to be responsible for pro-inflammatory prostaglandin formation [4, 48]. in addition, cox-2 has also
been discovered to be involved in the regulation of physiologic functions (for recent reviews see [15, 16]). in the kidney, cox-2 derived prostaglandins seem to mediate the renin
production that in turn regulates sodium balance and fluid
volume [77]. in the female genital tract, cox-2 derived prostaglandins have been suggested to control ovulation and after
fertilisation the implantation of the embryo in the uterine
endometrium [78]. in the spinal cord and in the brain cox2, is thought to provide prostaglandins that may modulate
postsynaptic signalling of excitatory neurones [79].
nsaids have been demonstrated to inhibit both cox
isoenzymes to various extents [4, 30, 49, 50]. the nsaid
 xxxd2508xxx  was previously found to inhibit cox at nanomolar concentrations in rat polymorphonuclear leukocytes
in vitro [1]. a discrimination of the two cox isoenzymes
was not then possible. hence with the discovery of cox-2,
we asked ourselves whether  xxxd2508xxx  would affect cox-1
or cox-2, or both of the cox isoenzymes.
cox-1 in the absence of cox-2 has been demonstrated
to be present in human platelets and in cells of the human

erythroleukemic cell line hel [31, 40]. testing  xxxd2508xxx ’s
cox-1 inhibitory potential employing these cells i.e. the  xxxd208xxx -induced aggregation of human platelets and
the formation of txb2 in hel cells confirmed the potent
cox inhibitory activity of  xxxd2508xxx  observed earlier [1].
 xxxd2508xxx ’s inhibitory activity was greater than that of
other oxicams and structurally unrelated nsaids. similar
ic50 values for  xxxd2508xxx  and the other oxicams were obtained in both assays, although compound incubation time
and principle of measurement was different (see materials
and methods). diclofenac, indomethacin and tenidap elicited
more pronounced cox-1 inhibition in the erythroleukemic
cells than in platelets. this could be explained by the different incubation periods in both assays, since inhibition of
cox by indomethacin and some other nsaids was found to
be time-dependent [51, 52].
to assess  xxxd2508xxx ’s potency against cox-2, we also
employed two intact cell assays and compared these results
with the ones from the cox-1 inhibition experiments. in
lps-stimulated murine macrophages (j774.2 cells)  xxxd2508xxx  and diclofenac inhibited cox-2 approximately equipotently, whereas the other nsaids showed markedly less
inhibitory effects (table 1). this was also observed in the
human cox-2 assay using lps-stimulated monocytic cells

376

(mono mac 6 cells) (table 2). the comparison of the ic50
values of murine cox-2 with the ones from either human
cox-1 assay indicated selectivity of all compounds for
cox-1 (table 1). this is in contrast to the comparison of
human cox-2 inhibition with human cox-1 inhibition of
either of the two cox-1 assays. the human cox-1/human
cox-2 comparison revealed equipotent inhibition of both
human cox isoenzymes by  xxxd2508xxx  (table 2). this was
also observed for the other nsaids tested, with the exception that tenidap and diclofenac showed some cox-1 selectivity, and that  xxxd3311xxx  and  xxxd2561xxx  showed some preference for cox-2 (tables 1, 2). of all tested oxicams and
structurally unrelated nsaids  xxxd2508xxx  was the most
potent cox-1/-2 inhibitor in the intact cell assays.
our ic50 values of the classical nsaids on both human
cox-1 and human cox-2 in intact cells are in good agreement with the observations made by others [49] who used
similar intact cell assays for the assessment of human cox1/-2 inhibition. our murine cox-2 inhibition data are also in
line with the ic50 values reported earlier [30]. the differences
between their and our murine cox-2 ic50 values to the ic50
values in human cox-2 testing suggests that comparisons of
potencies of compounds against cox-1 or cox-2 should be
made within the same species and within the same test set-up
in order to arrive at meaningful selectivities for the compounds tested for.
testing of compounds in the environment of whole blood
more closely resembles the in vivo situation than do intact
cell assays. therefore, in further experiments, we investigated  xxxd2508xxx ’s inhibitory potential on cox-1/-2 using
whole blood from healthy volunteers [32]. clotting of whole
blood as a measure of cox-1 as well as the formation of
pge2 in lps-stimulated blood as a measure of cox-2 was
markedly and equipotently inhibited by  xxxd2508xxx , albeit to
about 20-fold less than in intact cell assays. this was also
observed with the other compounds tested for comparison.
the cox-2 preferential inhibitor  xxxd2561xxx  was 4.7-fold
more selective for cox-2 and interestingly ketorolac also
exhibited a similar selectivity for cox-2. these two results
contrast with the selectivity results in the intact cell assays by
us and others [30, 49]. the differing effects of nsaids in
whole blood may be due to the complex environment of
blood per se [32]. thus, besides cox inhibition, other
properties of the compounds could influence their inhibitory
potency: effects on the mobilisation of  xxxd208xxx  from
intra- or extra-cellular sources [53], plasma protein binding
[54], stability in plasma, or effects on cox-2 gene expression. the latter point has been a matter of debate, and was
recently disproved for human macrophage cox-2 for
aspirin, indomethacin and naproxen [55].
the inhibition of the synthesis of prostaglandins by
nsaids or the specific neutralisation of pge2 by antibodies
has been demonstrated to effectively reduce inflammatory
symptoms such as oedema and pain [16–18]. however, prostaglandins do not seem to elicit inflammation per se. they
instead amplify inflammatory symptoms elicited by other
substances such as pro-inflammatory cytokines, histamine,
bradykinin and no [19, 56–58]. no localised in high
amounts in inflamed tissues has been shown to induce pain
locally [59, 60] and enhances central as well as peripheral
nociception [61]. inflammatory no is thought to be synthe-

sised by the inducible isoform of  xxxd2738xxx  synthase
(inos). the no inhibitory activity of  xxxd2508xxx  in lps-stimulated macrophages in vitro at mmolar concentrations suggests that  xxxd2508xxx  may exhibit this potentially favourable
activity in controlling inflammation and pain clinically. indomethacin and  xxxd2969xxx  showed comparable but lesser inhibitory activities on no levels in our experiments. ketorolac,
ibuprofen and naproxen did not show significantly reduced
no levels up to 300 mm. inhibitory activities of the no formation in stimulated rodent macrophages by indomethacin,
ibuprofen and aspirin have been demonstrated previously
[62]. the reported ic50 values for indomethacin at approximately 250 mmolar and for ibuprofen between 1 and 2 mm
suggest that our test model is in good agreement with theirs,
underscoring  xxxd2508xxx ’s potency in inhibiting no formation.  xxxd2508xxx ’s no inhibitory activity in vitro at
mmolar concentrations could translate to a clinically relevant
activity complementing  xxxd2508xxx ’s potent cox-1/-2 inhibition.
pro-inflammatory cytokines such as  xxxg2296xxx , il-1, il-6
and chemokines such as il-8 have been shown to control
inflammation in vitro as well as in vivo [23, 24]. these cytokines are thought to be interlinked in a cascade being produced serially by e.g. macrophages during an inflammatory
response. furthermore, the development of hyperalgesic
states during inflammation is thought to be mediated by proinflammatory cytokines [19]. therefore, we investigated
whether  xxxd2508xxx  would possibly influence the formation
of  xxxg2296xxx , il-1b, il-6 and il-8. since prostaglandins have
been shown to affect the formation of cytokines [18, 63], we
examined whether  xxxd2508xxx  would directly affect cytokine
formation in an in vitro model that does not involve either
cox-1 or cox-2 related prostaglandins. cells of the human
monocytic cell line thp-1 produce these cytokines without
synthesising prostaglandins following direct stimulation
with lps [64 and our own unpublished observations], which
is omitting any  xxxd2925xxx -induced differentiation [65].
 xxxd2508xxx  and  xxxd2969xxx  only slightly affected the production of  xxxg2296xxx , il-1b and il-8. a marked effect was however
seen with  xxxd2508xxx  inhibiting the production of il-6.  xxxd2969xxx  also inhibited il-6 production but, ten times less
potently. inhibition of il-6 production was not paralleled by
decreased levels of il-6 specific mrna. therefore,  xxxd2508xxx  and  xxxd2969xxx  do not seem to counteract lps-stimulation, signal transduction or il-6 gene transcription in this
model. they rather seem to inhibit post-transcriptional or
translational mechanisms of the il-6 gene expression. the
direct inhibition of il-6 formation by  xxxd2508xxx  may well
complement the indirect il-6 inhibition previously reported
for nsaids in general which is mediated by the inhibition of
pge2 formation by nsaids [18, 66]. thus, direct inhibition
of il-6 formation may present a favourable additional antiinflammatory and analgesic property of  xxxd2508xxx  since  xxxg1181xxx  exhibits a plethora of pro-inflammatory effects and its
levels have been correlated to inflammatory disease activity
including hyperalgesia [67, 68].
the potent cox-1/-2 inhibition by  xxxd2508xxx  we observed in vitro is in good agreement with animal experiments
where inhibition of cox-1-mediated prostaglandin synthesis
is thought to be at least partly involved in compound efficacy
such as acetylcholine-induced writhing, or where cox-2

vol. 48, 1999

 xxxd2508xxx  inhibits (cox)-1/-2, inos and il-6 formation

inhibition such as carrageenan-induced paw oedema has
been suggested to be causal for the anti-inflammatory effects [18, 45, 46]. furthermore,  xxxd2508xxx ’s potent in vitro
cox-1/-2 inhibition matches well the clinical observations
of effective anti-inflammatory and analgesic activities
[9–12]. however, whether clinically administered doses of
 xxxd2508xxx  are also clinically effective in inhibition of il-6
and no formation is unknown. the ic50 values for no and
il-6 formation inhibition differ by four orders of magnitude
to the ic50 values for cox inhibition from intact cells. the
peak plasma concentration of a single orally-administered
dose of 8 mg  xxxd2508xxx  amounts to approximately 2 mm
[69], which is well above the ic50 value for cox inhibition,
but below the ic50 values for the inhibition of inos or il-6
formation. in plasma,  xxxd2508xxx  and other nsaids are
bound to protein to more than 95% [6, 54]. capillary leakage
during inflammation leads to extravasion of protein-bound
nsaid and the acidic tissue environment can facilitate the
accumulation and cellular uptake of acidic nsaids such as
 xxxd2508xxx  [54]. therefore, the concentrations of  xxxd2508xxx  that inhibited the formation of il-6 and no in our in
vitro experiments could be relevant, not to the plasma concentrations, but perhaps to concentrations in inflamed tissues.
cox-1 inhibition is thought to be responsible for the
renal and gastrointestinal side effects of nsaids. the new
cox-2 selective inhibitors currently being developed [16,
70] have been demonstrated to effectively suppress symptoms of inflammatory prostaglandin formation in animals
[46, 71] as well as in man in the absence of classical nsaid
side effects [70]. however, it is still a matter of discussion
whether inflammation-related pain can be sufficiently treated with selective cox-2 inhibitors, since cox-2-mediated
prostaglandin formation starts only after the transcriptional
induction and synthesis of new cox-2 protein. studies on
acute pain have clearly shown involvement of cox-1-related
prostaglandins in the periphery as well as in the spinal cord
[72]. nsaids are effective in models of acute pain. in addition, nsaids have been observed to modify chronic inflammatory disease which is to some extent debated for cox-2
selective compounds [73]. furthermore, studies in cox-1
and cox-2 gene knock-out mice involving topically-administered skin irritants such as phorbol esters indicated significant cox-1-mediated prostaglandin formation [74–76]. in
these models, cox-2 was not required for this type of
inflammation. a recent study using the murine chronic
granulomatous tissue air pouch model pointed in the same
direction, that the cox-2 selective inhibitors  xxxd2727xxx  and
ns-398 failed to reduce granuloma development and vascularity whereas aspirin, indomethacin and steroids showed
these effects [73]. in the carrageenan-induced rat paw
oedema which is driven by cox-2-related prostaglandins a
selective cox-1 inhibitor produced markedly decreased
prostaglandin levels. surprisingly this did not parallel substantial anti-inflammatory or analgesic effects. however, the
administration of a cox-2 selective inhibitor was fully
active in reversing oedema and hyperalgesia [80]. the differing effects of decreased prostaglandin levels in the periphery
were reflected by the prostaglandin levels in the cerebrospinal fluids. the cox-1 selective inhibitor only marginally
reduced elevated prostaglandin levels, whereas the cox-2
selective inhibitor reduced the elevated prostaglandin levels

377

to normal [80]. thus, cox-2 selective inhibitors may ultimately prove to be superior in the management of inflammatory disease and pain. until then balanced cox-1/-2 inhibition, perhaps in combination with the inhibition of other proinflammatory principles, offers an effective therapeutic regimen in controlling acute and chronic inflammation, hyperalgesia and pain.
