metabolism and is a pro-inflammatory lipid mediator that potently stimulates neutrophil chemotaxis to sites of inflammation (1–3). ltb4 is involved in the following events: stimulating
immigration of leukocytes from the blood stream (4, 5); neutrophil activation leading to degranulation and release of noxious
mediators, enzymes, and superoxides (6); inflammatory pain
(7); host defense against infection (3); and increased interleukin production (8) and transcription (9). these processes have
been implicated in the pathogenesis of a variety of diseases
such as inflammatory bowel disease (ibd), psoriasis, arthritis,
and asthma (10, 11). considerable efforts have been devoted in
the development of antagonists targeting the cell surface receptors, by screening compounds with radioligand binding assays utilizing membrane preparations from cells such as neutrophils. potential treatments of various inflammatory
conditions with these antagonists have been recently illustrated in human and animal models (11–15).
extensive studies of ltb4 and the search for the molecular
identity of its receptors have resulted in the recent cloning of a
ltb4 receptor (16) (ltb4-r1). this protein is a cell surface
receptor and belongs to the g-protein-coupled receptor superfamily containing seven membrane-spanning domains. the
ltb4 receptor binds ltb4 with high affinity, which in turn
leads to intracellular signaling and chemotaxis. among the
major tissues tested, the receptor is expressed abundantly only
in peripheral leukocytes (16). in this report, we describe the
identification of a novel ltb4 receptor (ltb4-r2) that shares
homology with ltb4-r1, and the finding that the two receptors
are genetically linked. this novel receptor is highly expressed
in several peripheral tissues such as liver, spleen, and intestine
and binds ltb4 with high affinity. the ligand-receptor interaction activates the receptor leading to intracellular signal
transduction.

leukotriene b4 (ltb4) is a product of eicosanoid metabolism and acts as an extremely potent chemotactic
mediator for inflammation. ltb4 exerts positive effects
on the immigration and activation of leukocytes. these
effects suggest an involvement of ltb4 in several diseases: inflammatory bowel disease, psoriasis, arthritis,
and asthma. ltb4 elicits actions through interaction
with one or more cell surface receptors that lead to
chemotaxis and inflammation. one leukotriene b4 receptor has been recently identified (ltb4-r1). in this
report we describe cloning of a cdna encoding a novel
358-amino acid receptor (ltb4-r2) that possesses seven
membrane-spanning domains and is homologous (42%)
and genetically linked to ltb4-r1. expression of
ltb4-r2 is broad but highest in liver, intestine, spleen,
and kidney. in radioligand binding assays, membranes
prepared from cos-7 cells transfected with ltb4-r2
cdna displayed high affinity (kd ⴝ 0.17 nm) for
[3h]ltb4. radioligand competition assays revealed high
affinities of the receptor for ltb4 and ltb5, and 20hydroxy-ltb4, and intermediate affinities for 15(s)hete and 12-oxo-ete. three ltb4 receptor antagonists, 14,15-dehydro-ltb4, ltb4-3-aminopropylamide,
and u-75302, had high affinity for ltb4-r1 but not for
ltb4-r2. no apparent affinity binding for the receptors
was detected for the  xxxg599xxx -selective antagonists montelukast and  xxxd3545xxx . ltb4 functionally mobilized
intracellular calcium and inhibited  xxxd1742xxx -stimulated camp production in 293 cells. the discovery of this
new receptor should aid in further understanding the
roles of ltb4 in pathologies in these tissues and may
provide a tool in identification of specific antagonists/
agonists for potential therapeutic treatments.

novel ltb4 receptor subtype

three times with 150 ␮l of buffer containing hanks’ balanced salt
solution, 40 mm hepes, ph 7.4, and 250 mm probenecid. one hundred ␮l
of the wash buffer was added after the final wash, and ca2⫹ flux was
measured with a fluorometric imaging plate reader (molecular devices) after addition of 40 ␮l of the buffer containing appropriate concentration of ligands.
 xxxd1773xxx  assay—293 cells were transfected with plasmid dna
and the superfect agent. forty-eight hours post-transfection, 100
ng/ml pertusis toxin (ptx) was added to the cells, which were incubated
at 37 °c overnight. immediately prior to assay, the cells were released
from the plate by the cell dissociation buffer (sigma), and pelleted by
centrifuge at 2000 rpm, 5 min, at 4 °c in a 10-ml ficon tube. the cells
were resuspended and seeded at 50,000 cells/50 ␮l of stimulation buffer/
per well of flashplate. fresh ltb4 was prepared in hanks’-hepes
buffer (hanks’  xxxd2988xxx  with 10 mm hepes, ph 7.4, and
0.2% bsa (w/v), filtered, and stored at 4 °c). fifty ␮l of ltb4 plus or
minus 10 ␮m  xxxd1742xxx  was added to the flashplate. standard camp
ranging from 0 to 1000 pmol/ml were arranged in the same plate. the
plate was incubated on a rotating shaker at room temperature for 0.5 h.
at the end of the incubation, the assay was terminated by addition of
100 ␮l of the adenylyl cyclase activation flashplate detection mixture
(perkinelmer life sciences). the flashplate was covered and gently
agitated on a shaker for 3–5 h. after the development, the flashplate
was counted on a 96-well counter. a standard curve was prepared, and
the counts were converted to mass (pmol of camp/ml).  xxxd1773xxx 
production data were analyzed with non-linear regression.
analyses of northern blots/dot blots—hybridization to northern
blots and dot blots (clontech) was carried out using a pcr-generated 440-bp dna fragment from the 5⬘-untranslated region of the open
reading frame (orf) of ltb4-r2. the dna fragment was random
prime-labeled with [32p]dctp, and the blots were hybridized for 14 h in
expresshyb (clontech) containing ⬃2 million cpm/ml radiolabeled
probe. the following day the blots were washed according to the manufacturer’s protocol and exposed to kodak biomax ms film for 6 days at
⫺70 °c. the films were analyzed for relative expression levels using the
mcid m4 image analysis system (imaging research, ontario, canada).
for the known receptor ltb4-r1, a 425-bp fragment corresponding to
nucleotides 49 – 474 of the published ltb4 open reading frame (16) was
generated by pcr. the northern blot and dot blot analyses were carried out with the random-prime [32p]dctp-labeled fragment, hybridized overnight at 65 °c with multiple tissue dot blots and northern
blots (clontech).
results

sequence analysis of the 1.1-kb pcr product resulting from
multiple race amplification steps identified a putative orf of
1077 bp (fig. 1a), which encodes a protein of 358 amino acids
(fig. 1b). hydrophobicity analysis of the 358-amino acid sequence suggested that there are seven transmembrane-spanning regions. blast analysis with the amino acid sequence
against the genbank娂 data base revealed homology of the
amino acid sequence to the human leukocyte ltb4 receptor
(ltb4-r1, 42%) (16) (fig. 1b), the human  xxxg1871xxx  (32%) (17),
and the human somatostatin receptor sstr4 (27%) (18, 19).
the amino acid sequence of the receptor is only distantly related (⬃18% homology) to the recently cloned leukotriene d4
receptor (20, 21). the high amino acid sequence homology to
ltb4-r1 and the presence in all seven transmembrane domains of conserved amino acid motifs indicated that this was a
g-protein-coupled receptor. thus the novel receptor was tentatively termed as ltb4-r2.
alignment of the cdna of ltb4-r2 with the orf of ltb4-r1
revealed that the 5⬘-untranslated region (utrs) of the transcript (genbank娂 accession number d89079 (16)) is identical
to the coding region at the 3⬘-portion and the immediate downstream sequence in the 3⬘-utr of the orf of ltb4-r2. this
analysis suggests that portions of both ltb4 receptors could
exist on a single mrna and the two ltb4 receptors are in the
same chromosomal region. a genomic clone containing coding
regions of ltb4-r2 and ltb4-r1 was obtained (pac clone
159k10) by pcr screening of a human pac library using
primers 63u and 480l in the coding region of ltb4-r2 (fig.

(hdpya90r, see fig. 1a). a phylogenetic analysis (wisconsin package,
genetics computer group, madison, wi) suggested that the sequence
was related to a leukotriene receptor covering transmembrane domains
3 through 6. further computational survey of public data bases identified contiguous sequences that resulted in a composite 2451-base sequence that contained a 888-base sequence at the 3⬘-end, which appeared to be a portion of an open reading frame of a gpcr (met to tm6,
see fig. 1a). a 3⬘-race was performed to obtain the missing 3⬘-portion
of the putative open reading frame (orf) by pcr using the marathon
race kit for pcr reactions and human liver marathon-ready cdna
(clontech) as a template. primary pcr using oligo347 and  xxxg1222xxx  (35
cycles of 94 °c for 30 s and 68 °c for 3 min), secondary pcr using
primers ap2 and oligo348a (35 cycles of 94 °c for 30 s, 65 °c for 30 s,
and 72 °c for 2 min), and tertiary pcr using primers ap2 and
oligo348b (35 cycles of 94 °c for 30s, 65 °c for 30 s, and 72 °c for 2 min)
resulted in a ⬃400-base pair (bp) 3⬘-race product (see fig. 1a). to
obtain a full orf, a 5⬘-primer (oligo358) containing the atg codon in
the 888-base sequence and a 3⬘-primer (oligo359) containing the putative stop codon in the 3⬘-race sequence were generated. a pcr with
this pair of primers and human liver cdna as a template (35 cycles of
94 °c for 30 s, 65 °c for 30 s, and 72 °c for 2 min) yielded a pcr product
of ⬃1.1 kb (sp9030, fig. 1a).
isolation of genomic clone—a genomic clone containing both
ltb4-r2 (sp9030) and ltb4-r1 receptors was obtained by pcr screening a human pac pcrable dna pool (genome systems, st. louis, mo)
with primers 63u and 480l. pcr was performed using pcr supermix
(life technologies, inc) with a thermal cycling of 94 °c for 30 s, 55 °c
for 30 s, and 72 °c for 30 s (35 cycles). the size of the intron was
determined by pcr using supermix hifidelity (life technologies) with
primers oligo347 and mm311 and the pac dna as a template (94 °c
for 30 s, 55 °c for 30 s, and 68 °c for 5 min). the resulting pcr product
(⬃4.0 kb) was gel-purified with a qiaex ii gel extraction kit (qiagen)
and partially sequenced (⬃600 bp) at each of the two ends of the
fragment.
transfection of cells and membrane preparations—cos-7 cells
grown in dmem/10% fcs at 80 –90% confluency were transfected with
superfect agent (qiagen) at 20 ␮g of dna/150-mm plate. 48 h after
transfection, medium was changed to opti-mem or dmem/opti-mem
(1:1)/5%fcs. 72 h after transfection, the cells were washed with 20 ml
of phosphate-buffered saline without ca2⫹/mg2⫹ and incubated with 10
ml of 10 mm hepes, ph 7.4, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20
␮g/ml aprotinin at room temperature for 30 min. the cells were scraped
off the plate and vortexed. the cell suspension was then centrifuged at
13,000g at 4 °c for 15 min. the pellets were resuspended in 1.8 ml of 50
mm tris-cl, ph 7.5, and vortexed. the membranes were homogenized
with a 23-gauge needle. the protein concentration of the membrane
preparations was determined with the bca agents (pierce).
radioligand binding assay—for saturation binding, 150 ␮l of binding assay buffer (30 mm hepes, ph 7.4, 10 mm cacl2, 10 mm mgcl2,
0.05% fatty acid free bsa (w/v), kept cold on ice) containing 24 ␮g of
membranes were mixed with 50 ␮l of binding assay buffer containing 0
or 1 ␮m leukotriene in 2% (v/v) me2so. [3h]ltb4 (perkinelmer life
sciences, 50 nm) was added to the assays at increasing concentrations.
the reactions were incubated for 1 h at 4 °c with slow rotation. binding
solutions were filtered through multiscreen fb filters (millipore) presoaked with 50 ␮l of binding assay buffer for 1 h at room temperature,
and the filters were washed twice with 100 ␮l of 50 mm tris-cl, ph 7.5
(ice-cold). fifty ␮l of microscint fluid was added to the filters and
counted for the bound radioligands. for radioligand competition assays,
160 ␮l of binding assay buffer containing membranes were mixed with
20 ␮l of binding assay buffer containing various concentrations of
competing compounds in 6% me2so (v/v). a final 20 ␮l of binding assay
buffer containing 1 ␮l of [3h]ltb4 (perkinelmer life sciences, 50 nm,
final concentration 0.25 nm) in 6% (v/v) me2so was added to start the
binding reaction. the final concentration of ethanol as the solvent in the
stock ltb4 solution was 0.5% (v/v). binding data were analyzed with
non-linear regression software (prism; graphpad, san diego, ca).
intracellular ca2⫹ concentration measurement—293-ebna cells
grown in dmem/10% fcs at 80 –90% confluency were transfected with
the superfect agent (qiagen). on the next day the cells were
trypsinized off the plate and washed with phosphate-buffered saline
without ca2⫹/mg2⫹. the cells were then seeded at a cell density of
35,000 cells/100 ␮l of medium into 96-well plates precoated with polyd-lysine (becton dickinson). on the third day, the medium was removed, and 100 ␮l of hanks’  xxxd2988xxx  (without phenol red)
containing 4 ␮m of fluo-3, am (molecular probes), 20 mm hepes, ph
7.4, 0.1% (w/v) bsa, and 250 mm probenecid were added, and the cells
were incubated at 37 °c, 5% co2 for 1 h. the cells were then washed

novel ltb4 receptor subtype

2a). direct sequencing of the pac clone revealed no intervening sequences in the coding region of either receptor, thus both
receptors are encoded by intronless orfs (fig. 2a). a second
pcr using primers oligo347 and mm311 revealed a single
⬃3.6-kb intron 3⬘ downstream of ltb4-r2 and 5⬘ upstream of
ltb4-r1 (fig. 2a). genbank娂 entry al096870 is a genomic
sequence from chromosome 14. this fragment contains both
the ltb4-r1 and ltb4-r2 genes, as determined by blast.
the genomic sequence containing both ltb4-r2 and
ltb4-r1 was compared with several mrna transcripts of
ltb4-r2 and ltb4-r1 (fig. 2, b–d). the 3⬘-untranslated sequence of ltb4-r2 is identical to the 5⬘-end of the intron,
suggesting that this transcript contains only ltb4-r2 (fig.
2b). there were three genbank娂 entries that contained
ltb4-r1 mrnas: d89078, d89079, and u33448. d89079 (16)
contains the coding sequences of both ltb4-r2 and ltb4-r1
but does not have the 3.6-kb intron (fig. 2c). u33448 (22)
contains only the coding region of ltb4-r1, and the 5⬘-untranslated sequence is identical to the 3⬘-end of the 3.6-kb intron
sequence (fig. 2d). d89078 also contains only the coding region
of ltb4-r1; however, the 5⬘-untranslated region is identical to
the middle portion of the 3.6-kb intron (fig. 2e).
dot blot and northern blot analyses were performed to determine the expression of ltb4-r2 mrna in human tissues. a
dot blot containing mrnas from 56 human tissues (clon-

tech) was hybridized to a 440-bp fragment derived from the
5⬘-utr of ltb4-r2 cdna. the highest expression of ltb4-r2
was detected in liver followed by small intestine, spleen, and
fetal liver (20 – 40% of that of liver; fig. 3a). adrenal gland and
pituitary had expression levels between 10 and 20% of those in
the liver. all of the other 49 tissues expressed ltb4-r2  xxxd1891xxx %
of or less than that of the liver level (fig. 3a), including peripheral leukocytes in which ltb4-r1 is highly expressed (16).
using the same fragment as probe to hybridize a northern blot,
a mrna of approximately 1.6 kb with high abundance was
seen in the liver and a weak band in kidney (fig. 3b). no
expression was detected in heart, brain, placenta, skeletal muscle, and pancreas. employing a quantitative pcr method (taqman, pe biosystems) with 27 cdna preparations generated
primarily from human fetal and diseased tissues as templates,
the highest expression of ltb4-r2 was again detected in fetal
small intestine, crohn’s colon, fetal liver, and fetal lung (not
shown). as is the case for the novel ltb4 receptor, the ltb4-r1
mrna appears to be widely distributed in human tissues based
on the results of the dot blot. ltb4-r1 is most abundant in
immune-related tissues, including spleen, peripheral blood leukocytes, and bone marrow. although there is also low expression of the ltb4-r1 mrna in liver, it is not as prominent as
that for ltb4-r2. the dot blot data for ltb4-r1 are consistent
with the northern blot analysis shown by yokomizo et al. (16)

in which high expression was seen in peripheral leukocytes and
low or no mrna was detected in other tissues.
radioligand binding assays were performed to directly test
the ability of ltb4-r2 to bind ltb4. the orf of ltb4-r2 was
cloned in expression vector pcr3.1 to form construct pcr3.1ltb4-r2. cos-7 cells were transfected with the construct, and
membranes were prepared for a [3h]ltb4 binding assay. as
shown in fig. 4a, specific binding was observed with the membranes prepared from cells transfected with pcr3.1-ltb4-r2;
in contrast, no specific binding was seen with membranes prepared from cells transfected with vector alone. because serum
used in the cell cultures may carry low concentrations of ltb4
(23), radioligand binding assays were performed in parallel
with membranes prepared from cells grown for the last 24 h in
either serum-free (opti-mem) or medium containing 5% (v/v)
fcs. no difference in the abilities of the two membrane preparations to bind [3h]ltb4 were found (fig. 4a), indicating that
the serum used in the experiments did not affect ligand-receptor interaction through potential effects of either desensitization or receptor down-regulation. saturation radioligand binding assays employing membranes from cells cultured in serum
yielded a kd of 0.17 ⫾ 0.07 nm and bmax of 70 ⫾ 8 fmol/mg of
membrane protein (n ⫽ 3) (fig. 4b). similar kd and bmax
values were obtained when membranes were prepared from
cells cultured in serum-free medium: kd ⫽ 0.21 ⫾ 0.06 nm and
bmax ⫽ 64 ⫾ 7 fmol/mg of protein (not shown).
the pharmacological profiles of ltb4-r2 and ltb4-r1 were
compared in radioligand competition assays using [3h]ltb4 as
the radioligand and a number of unlabeled leukotrienes, leukotriene analogs, leukotriene receptor antagonists, and  xxxg147xxx  products as competitors (table i). ltb4, ltb5, and an
ltb4 metabolite, 20-hydroxy-ltb4, have high affinities for
both ltb-r2 (ki ⱕ 41 nm and relative affinity ⱕ 18) and
ltb4-r1 (ki ⱕ 3.7 nm and relative affinity ⱕ 5.3) receptors
(table i and fig. 5). a  xxxg147xxx  product, 15(s)-hete,
and an  xxxd2603xxx , 12-oxo-ete, displayed
moderate affinities for ltb4-r2 (relative affinity ⫽ 67–73) but
had low binding affinities for ltb4-r1 (ki ⬎ 1000 nm) (table i

and fig. 5). the affinities of the three ltb4 receptor antagonists (14,15-dehydro-ltb4 (24), ltb4-3-aminopropylamide
(25, 26), and u-75302 (27)) were relatively lower for ltb4-r2
(ki ⫽ 473–5434 nm) than for ltb4-r1 (ki ⫽ 5.1–27 nm) (table
i). another ltb4 metabolite, 20-carboxy-ltb4, bound ltb4-r1
with high affinity (ki ⫽ 20 nm) but bound ltb4-r2 with much
lower affinity (ki ⬎ 1000 nm) (table i).
other test compounds displayed generally low affinities for
the ltb4-r2 and ltb4-r1 receptors in the competition assay
(table i). these compounds include several  xxxg147xxx 
products such as 5(s)-hete, 20-hete,  xxxd163xxx , and (⫾)5hete (relative affinities ⬎ 435, table i), two  xxxd208xxx 
derivatives (5-oxo-ete and 5,6-dehydroarachidonic acid, relative affinities ⬎ 435), and lipoxin-a4 with affinities of ⬃1400
nm (ki) for the two receptors (table i). 6-trans-ltb4, a trans
stereoisomer of ltb4, also bound the receptors with relatively
low affinity (table i). leukotrienes in the c, d, e, and f
families and methyl ester of the leukotriene as, displayed weak
or no affinities for ltb4-r2, as well as ltb4-r1 (table i). two
 xxxg599xxx -antagonists, montelukast (singulair) and  xxxd3545xxx 
(accolate) that have high affinities for the  xxxg599xxx  (20,
21), had affinities at least 4000 times lower than that of ltb4
for ltb4-r2 and ltb4-r1 (fig. 5, table i).
the ability of ltb4-r2 receptor to mediate intracellular signal transduction was examined by measurements of fluorescence of fluo-3, am as intracellular ca2⫹ flux and by assays of
 xxxd1742xxx -induced camp production. interaction of ltb4-r2
expressed in 293-ebna cells with ltb4 activated cellular ca2⫹
release (fig. 6a), suggesting a functional coupling of ltb4-r2
with intracellular g-proteins. in contrast, cells that were mocktransfected with vector alone did not respond to incubation
with ltb4 (fig. 6a). the ability of the receptor to mediate
inhibition of  xxxd1742xxx -stimulated intracellular camp was
tested in 293 cells expressing ltb4-r2. ltb4 caused a dosedependent inhibition of the camp production (fig. 6b). nonlinear regression analysis of the data yielded a maximum inhibition of ⬃60% and ec50 of 58 ⫾ 20 nm (n ⫽ 2). incubation of

discussion

a thorough understanding of the roles of ltb4 requires
identification and characterization of all the ltb4 receptors.
we have cloned and characterized a novel ltb4 receptor that is
different from and genetically linked to the previously cloned
ltb4 receptor (ltb4-r1). the two receptors vary in primary
structures displaying only 42% homology and in tissue expression patterns, but both are able to bind ltb4 with high affinity
and are functional in stimulating intracellular signaling. in
addition, the two receptors are genetically linked at one locus of
the genome.
the cloned ltb4-r2 binds ltb4 with highest affinity among
the 31 ligands tested. the binding affinity is comparable to that
of ltb4 for the previously published ltb4-r1 receptor (table
i), indicating that the receptor is a ltb4 receptor subtype.

consistent with this conclusion are the observations that
ltb4-r2 shares a high homology to ltb4-r1 and that the two
receptors are genetically co-localized (figs. 1 and 2). the ligand
affinity of ltb-r2 extends from ltb4 only to ltb5 and 20hydroxy-ltb4, whose structures are closely related to ltb4,
suggesting a specific ligand recognition (table i). high affinity
binding of 20-hydroxy-ltb4 to human pmns has been observed previously (28); it is more soluble than and expresses
functional activities similarly to ltb4, suggesting a more important role of 20-hydroxy-ltb4 in inflammation than ltb4
(28). except the moderate affinity of 12-oxo-ete and 15(s)hete for ltb4-r2, all the other ligands tested, including
analogs of ltb4 or  xxxg147xxx  products, do not bind the
receptor with high affinity (table i). we note that clinically
used  xxxg599xxx  antagonists montelukast and  xxxd3545xxx 
have no affinity for the receptor (fig. 5), consistent with the
finding that the two ltb4 receptors share low homology with

the  xxxg599xxx . although ltb4 and ltd4 are derived from
a common metabolic pathway, their receptors are nevertheless
phylogenetically distant, suggesting the use of a common pathway in regulations of diverse physiological functions.
the two receptors possess different pharmacological profiles.
like ltb4-r2, ltb4-r1 binds ltb4, ltb5, and 20-hydroxyltb4 with high affinity (table i). however, several compounds,
including 14,15-dehydro-ltb4, ltb4-3-aminopropylamide,
u-75302, and 20-carboxy-ltb4, which do not bind ltb4-r2
tightly, bind ltb4-r1 with high affinity (table i). in contrast,
12-oxo-ete and 15(s)-hete showed preferential binding to
ltb4-r2 (table i). the trans stereoisomer of ltb4 (6-transltb4) displayed low affinity for either ltb4-r1 or ltb4-r2
(table i), suggesting trans stereospecificity at c-6 of ltb4 for
these receptors (29).
activation of the ltb4-r2 receptor leads to variable signaling events, including the mobilization of ca2⫹ and modulation
of intracellular camp levels. activation of the receptor leads to
the interaction of the receptor with two classes of g-protein: the
gq class, which mediates cellular ca2⫹ release, or the gi class,
which mediates inhibition of  xxxd1742xxx -stimulated camp production in a ptx-sensitive manner. the activation of multiple
signal transduction pathways suggests different roles for ltb4
through the interaction with ltb4-r2, depending on the availability of g-protein reserves in different cell types.

ltb4 activities may be regulated by differential expression
of the receptors in different tissues. the new ltb4 receptor is
highly expressed in the liver, intestine, and spleen, and to some
degree, in the kidney (fig. 3), suggesting that this receptor
regulates ltb4-mediated functions in these tissues. this expression pattern is in contrast to that of ltb4-r1, which is
expressed only in the peripheral leukocytes (16). the differential expression patterns (ref. 16, fig. 3) suggest the functions
of the two receptors are tissue-specific and may be involved in
different inflammatory processes associated with immune or
hepatointestinal systems. the characteristics of ltb4-r2 as an
active cell surface receptor that binds radiolabeled ltb4 saturatably (fig. 4b) and stimulates intracellular signaling (fig. 6)
support ltb4 acting as stimulant for cellular functions other
than merely being passively metabolized by liver cells.
relatively high expression of ltb4-r2 is consistent with
existing evidence implicating functions of ltb4 in these tissues. hepatic macrophages secreting ltb4 attract neutrophils
to the liver in rats with septic liver injury (30). in a hepatic
ischemia-reperfusion injury model, rat liver ltb4 levels were
increased to levels 50-fold those in control liver, accompanied
with increase of plasma  xxxg941xxx  activities
and polymorphonuclear leukocyte accumulation in the liver
(31). only the concentration of ltb4, not ltc4 and lte4, in

higher in rats fed corn oil and ethanol (alcoholic liver) than in
animals fed saturated fat and ethanol (no liver injury) (34).
finally, enhanced production of ltb4 by peripheral blood
mononuclear cells in patients was found with fulminant hepatitis (35).
in spleen, intraperitoneal ltb4 increased the survival rate
of mice infected with methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (36). guinea pig spleen membrane preparations have high
affinity for ltb4 and contain moderate number of ltb4 binding sites (37); this receptor has high affinity for ltb4 and
20-hydroxy-ltb4 but low affinity for 20-carboxy-ltb4 (37), a
profile similar to ltb4-r2 (table i). in a rat renal ischemiareperfusion injury model, chinese hamster ovary cells expressing a ltb4 receptor accumulate along with neutrophils in the
postischemic kidney; use of ltb4 antagonists led to the marked
decrease in accumulation of chinese hamster ovary cells and
neutrophils (38). spontaneously hypercholesterolemic rats,
characterized by glomerular infiltration of macrophages, fed a
normal diet developed end-stage renal failure in 26 weeks,
while those fed a diet supplemented with a ltb4 antagonist
showed normal renal function (39). in the intestinal system,
high ltb4 levels in colonic mucosa in patients with ibd were
detected (10), more than 10-fold chemotactic activity was found
in homogenates of ibd mucosa than in those of normal colonic
mucosa, and only lipid extract fraction co-eluted with ltb4 was
chemotactically active (40). furthermore, the response to ibd
mucosa was inhibited by anti-ltb4 antisera, suggesting that
ltb4 is an important stimulus to neutrophil chemotaxis in the
disease (40). given that ltb4-r1 is not found in either small

intestine or colon (16), ltb4-r2 may serve as a more promising
therapeutic target for treatment of ibd.
the close genetic linkage between the two ltb4 receptors
(fig. 2a) is unique to other gpcr families and may play a role
in regulating receptor activation. the genomic organization
illustrated in fig. 2a was confirmed by a more recent genbank娂 entry of a human genomic fragment, al096870, which
contains both ltb4 receptor genes. because the fragment is
located on chromosome 14, we mapped the ltb4-r1 and
ltb4-r2 receptors to this chromosome. although we have observed various transcripts that may contain single receptor of
ltb4-r1 or ltb4-r2, or may contain coding regions of both
ltb4-r1 and ltb4-r2, the molecular mechanism that regulates the formation of those transcripts from the two genes and
the regulatory roles of the transcripts in specific physiological
functions are still not clear.
identification of multiple ltb4 receptors with distinct primary structures, differential pharmacological profiles, and expression patterns points to the potential of differential regulation of ltb4 effects on a variety of inflammatory diseases.
delineation of pleiotropic ltb4 receptor activation is essential
for developments of disease- and receptor subtype-specific an-

antagonists (13–15, 41) toward the two ltb4 receptor subtypes, should these compounds be successfully developed and
safely used in clinic settings. the discovery of the hepatointestinal receptor and illustration of the cellular mechanisms mediated by this receptor should aid in design of further studies to
understand the roles of ltb4 in functions of the tissues and
identification of receptor subtype-specific antagonists and
agonists.
