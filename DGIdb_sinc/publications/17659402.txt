abstract clc-k cl- channels belong to the clc protein
family. in kidney and inner ear, they are involved in
transepithelial salt transport. mutations in clc-kb lead to
bartter’s syndrome, and mutations in the associated subunit
barttin produce bartter’s syndrome and deafness. we have
previously found that 3-phenyl-cpp blocks  xxxg473xxx  and
rclc-k1 from the extracellular side in the pore entrance.
recently, we have shown that  xxxd2723xxx  (nfa), a
nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory fenamate, produces biphasic behavior on human clc-k channels that suggests
the presence of two functionally different binding sites: an
activating site and a blocking site. here, we investigate in
more detail the interaction of nfa on clc-k channels.
mutants that altered block by 3-phenyl-2-(p-chlorophenoxy) xxxd3029xxx  (cpp) had no effect on nfa block,
indicating that the inhibition binding site of nfa is different from that of 3-phenyl-cpp and  xxxd2122xxx .
moreover, nfa does not compete with extracellular clions, suggesting that the binding sites of nfa are not located deep in the pore. differently from  xxxg473xxx , on the rat
homologue  xxxg473xxx , nfa has only an inhibitory effect. we
developed a quantitative model to describe the complex
action of nfa on  xxxg473xxx . the model predicts that  xxxg473xxx 
possesses two nfa binding sites: when only one site is
occupied, nfa increases  xxxg473xxx  currents, whereas the
occupation of both binding sites leads to channel block.

introduction
the clc cl- channels  xxxg473xxx  and clc-kb are two human,
highly homologous isoforms (kieferle et al., 1994). in rodents, these two isoforms are called  xxxg473xxx  and clc-k2
(adachi et al., 1994). probably,  xxxg473xxx  corresponds to  xxxg473xxx , whereas clc-kb is the species homologue of clc-k2.
within a single species the two isoforms are 90% identical in
their primary structure. the high degree of homology is
probably caused by a relatively recent gene duplication as
both genes are located on human chromosome 1p36 (brandt
& jentsch, 1995) and are separated by only 11 kb of genomic
dna (simon et al., 1997). they are selectively expressed in
the kidney and in the inner ear, where they are important for
transepithelial salt transport. in the kidney,  xxxg473xxx  is expressed in the thin ascending limb of henle’s loop and is
thought to be one major determinant of the efficiency of
urinary concentration (matsumura et al., 1999). in contrast,
clc-k2 is localized in the thick ascending limb of henle’s
loop and in other distal nephron segments (adachi et al.,
1994; kieferle et al., 1994; uchida & sasaki, 2005; vandewalle et al., 1997). in the inner ear, both channel isoforms
are expressed in the stria vascularis, where they are implicated in the production of k+-rich endolymph (estévez et al.,
2001). the relevance of these proteins is illustrated by genetic disorders. mutations in the gene coding for clc-kb
lead to bartter’s syndrome, a disease characterized by severe
salt wasting and hypokalemia (simon et al., 1997), whereas
mutations in the small essential clc-k channel subunit
barttin lead to bartter’s syndrome and deafness (birkenhäger
et al., 2001). a few years ago, the barttin protein was

123

74

identified as a b-subunit that is necessary for the functional
expression of clc-k channels (estévez et al., 2001). the
identification of barttin has allowed the functional heterologous expression of clc-k channels and exploration of
their pharmacological properties. small molecule ligands
may be useful tools and possible drug candidates in various
pathological situations (fong, 2004).
a structure-activity study allowed us to identify a compound, 3-phenyl-cpp, with a chlorophenoxy group and an
aromatic ring, able to block  xxxg473xxx  and  xxxg473xxx  currents.
interestingly, the highly homologous clc-kb channel is
fivefold less sensitive to 3-phenyl-cpp compared to  xxxg473xxx 
(picollo et al., 2004). we identified the amino acid residues
responsible for this different drug sensitivity that probably
make up part of the drug-binding site. in particular, asparagine n68 in  xxxg473xxx , located in helix b, plays a critical role in
the blocking activity of 3-phenyl-cpp (picollo et al., 2004).
very recently, liantonio et al. (2006) demonstrated that
 xxxg473xxx  has also an activating binding site.  xxxd2723xxx 
(nfa), a drug belonging to the class of fenamates and used
as a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug, increases  xxxg473xxx 
and clc-kb currents for concentrations in the 50–1,000 lm
range. instead, high concentrations (2–2.5 mm) of nfa
blocked  xxxg473xxx  currents (liantonio et al., 2006). the biphasic concentration-response relationship of nfa measured for  xxxg473xxx  evokes several questions. first, are there
one or two distinct nfa-binding sites on the channel protein? second, do nfa and the blocker 3-phenyl-cpp bind to
the same site(s)? third, is the nfa bind site(s) located in the
inner pore? to answer these questions, in the present study,
we used several approaches to investigate the mechanism
with which nfa interacts with clc-k channels. we demonstrate that the blocker-binding site of nfa is different
from that of 3-phenyl-cpp. moreover, we develop an
experimental protocol to study separately the potentiation
and inhibition effects of nfa on  xxxg473xxx . our data are well
described by a model in which there are two binding sites for
nfa. if nfa binds to one of the two sites, clc-k current
amplitude is increased, whereas if nfa binds simultaneously to both sites, the channel is blocked.
the ability of nfa to open and to block clc-k channels makes it a good starting point for identification of
diuretics or drugs useful in the treatment of bartter’s syndrome type iii.

(picollo et al., 2004), were coexpressed with mutant y98a
of human barttin, leading to enhancement of expression
(estévez et al., 2001). expression in oocytes and electrophysiological measurements were performed as previously
described (pusch et al., 2000). voltage-clamp data were
acquired at room temperature (21–25c) using a custom
acquisition program (gepulse) and a tec03 amplifier (npi
electronic, tamm, germany). currents were recorded in a
standard solution containing (in mm) 90 nacl, 10 cacl2, 1
mgcl2, 10 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazineethanesulfonic
acid (hepes) at ph 7.3. in experiments with low extracellular chloride concentration, 90 mm nacl was replaced
with 180 mm sucrose.
to evaluate the current-voltage relationship, the voltage-clamp pulse protocol was as follows: from a holding
potential of –30 mv, after a prepulse to 60 mv for 100
ms, voltage was stepped from –140 to 80 mv in 20-mv
increments for 200 ms, followed by a final tail pulse to –
100 mv. to evaluate the onset and washout of drug effects, a pulse to 60 mv was applied every 2 s. solutions
were applied under continuous perfusion. we noted that
under continuous perfusion the absolute effects of nfa at
500 lm and 1 mm were slightly different compared to
the data published earlier (liantonio et al., 2006), which
were obtained without continuous perfusion. the differences are relatively small; nevertheless, we regard the
current data obtained under continuous perfusion as more
reliable.
data analysis
to estimate the contribution of endogenous currents, we
used the following strategy. we applied a solution containing 100 mm i-, which blocks currents carried by clc-k
channels but not endogenous currents, and used the residual current in 100 mm i- to estimate the contribution of
endogenous currents (picollo et al., 2004). these leak
currents were subtracted from the control currents in the
absence and presence of a drug, to obtain a correct estimation of clc-k currents.
apparent dissociation constants, kd, for nfa and 3phenyl-cpp (for rclc-k1 and rclc-k1n68d) were determined by calculating the ratio of the steady-state currents
in the presence and absence of the drug and fitting the
ratios using a langmuir isotherm:

where c is the drug concentration and c is the hill coefficient. errors in the figures and text are indicated as

the perfusion protocol and the procedure to separate
nfa-mediated block and potentiation are described in
detail in the results section. the initial current immediately after washout (i2) was obtained by back-extrapolation
of a single-exponential fit to the decaying current phase
(see fig. 6).
nfa,  xxxd2122xxx  (ffa) and all other reagents were
purchased from sigma-aldrich (milan, italy). nfa, ffa
and 3-phenyl-cpp were dissolved in  xxxd1896xxx 
(dmso), leading to a final maximal concentration of
0.05% dmso. at this concentration, dmso by itself had
no effect on  xxxg473xxx -mediated currents and no effect on
membrane currents of water-injected oocytes. also, nfa at
200 lm had no effect on water-injected oocytes (data not
shown). because washout of nfa-mediated potentiation
was relatively slow (several minutes), we discarded oocytes after having applied nfa at a particular concentration. thus, the experiments illustrated below are from
unpaired oocytes. this strategy was adopted also to exclude unrelated long-term effects that may have been
caused by effects of nfa on cyclooxygenases.

results
effect of nfa on  xxxg473xxx 
nfa (fig. 1a) is a known blocker of many cl- and other
channels (gögelein et al., 1990; lee & wang, 1999;
mccarty et al., 1993; qu & hartzell, 2000; white &
aylwin, 1990). previously, we tested nfa on heterologously expressed clc-k channels and found that it inhibits
rat  xxxg473xxx  currents when applied at 200 lm (liantonio
et al., 2004). more recently, we showed that nfa has biphasic behavior on human  xxxg473xxx  and clc-kb channels:
low concentrations of nfa (50–500 lm) activate  xxxg473xxx ,
but higher concentrations (1–2 mm) block the channel
(liantonio et al., 2006). because in the earlier experiments
(liantonio et al., 2004) nfa was applied only at a single
concentration (200 lm) on  xxxg473xxx , in the first series of
experiments we tested different concentrations of nfa on
 xxxg473xxx  to find out if it has a biphasic effect also on the rat
channel. as  xxxg473xxx ,  xxxg473xxx  partially deactivates at positive potentials and activates at negative potentials
(fig. 1b, left). the >60% block seen after application of
200 lm nfa is illustrated in figure 1b (right). in contrast
to  xxxg473xxx , we observed that nfa blocked  xxxg473xxx  currents at all concentrations tested (10 lm–1 mm). the concentration-response curve is well fitted by a langmuir
isotherm equation with a hill coefficient equal to 1
(fig. 1c). this indicates that the inhibition produced by
nfa on  xxxg473xxx  can be well described by a simple 1:1
binding, resulting in the apparent kd of 94 ± 17 lm.

and absence of drug is plotted vs. nfa concentration. the line is
drawn according to the equation ic/i0 = 1/(1 + c/kd), with the apparent
kd value equal to 94 lm

because  xxxg473xxx  and  xxxg473xxx  are highly homologous, it
is reasonable to assume that the blocking site for nfa on
 xxxg473xxx  is identical, or at least very similar to the nfablocking site on  xxxg473xxx . therefore, using  xxxg473xxx  allowed
us to investigate in more detail the properties of the nfablocking binding site, without interference from nfa-induced potentiation. in particular, we investigated the relationship of the nfa inhibitory site with the previously
characterized inhibitory site for 3-phenyl-cpp (picollo
et al., 2004). we had identified several crucial amino acids
involved in the inhibitory binding site of 3-phenyl-cpp
(picollo et al., 2004). because nfa, as 3-phenyl-cpp, is
negatively charged at physiological ph, we tested if the
blocking site of nfa is equivalent to that of 3-phenyl-cpp.
in particular, we verified if residue 68 is involved in the
binding site of nfa. this neutral residue (asparagine) is
conserved among  xxxg473xxx  and  xxxg473xxx . in  xxxg473xxx , amino
acid 68 performs a critical role in the binding of 3-phenylcpp (picollo et al., 2004). the introduction of a negative
charge (clc-kan68d) in this position renders  xxxg473xxx  more

123

76

important for the blocking site of nfa. we conclude that
the inhibitory binding site of nfa is quite different from
that of 3-phenyl-cpp.
competition with ffa

drugs is plotted vs. drug concentration. lines are drawn according to
equation 1. 3-phenyl-cpp has a kd of 84 and 824 lm for  xxxg473xxx  and
clc-k1n68d, respectively. nfa has a kd of 94 lm and 156 for lm
 xxxg473xxx  and clc-k1n68d, respectively. dashed line in b represents

than fivefold less sensitive to 3-phenyl-cpp (picollo et al.,
2004). as in  xxxg473xxx , the corresponding mutation in  xxxg473xxx  (clc-k1n68d) is less sensitive to 3-phenyl-cpp compared with  xxxg473xxx  (fig. 2a). fitting equation 1 with a hill
coefficient of 1 resulted in an apparent kd for 3-phenylcpp >10-fold different in the mutant compared to wt
 xxxg473xxx  (84 lm for  xxxg473xxx  compared to 828 lm for the
n68d mutant). this result confirms that a neutral residue in
position 68 is important for the block produced by 3-phenyl-cpp also for  xxxg473xxx . instead, nfa produced only a
slightly smaller effect on clc-k1n68d with respect to wt
(fig. 2b). again, fitting equation (1) reveals a change in
the apparent kd of less than twofold (94 lm for  xxxg473xxx 
[dashed line in fig. 2b, taken from fig. 1c] and 156 lm
for clc-k1n68d [solid line in fig. 2b]), indicating that the
presence in position 68 of a neutral residue is much less

123

the above-described experiments suggest that the blocking
site of nfa is different from that of 3-phenyl-cpp, but
they do not answer the question of whether the inhibitory
binding site and the activating binding site overlap or if
they are independent from each other. to study the relationship between the two binding sites, we focused our
experiments on  xxxg473xxx , on which nfa has biphasic
behavior. among the fenamates, ffa is structurally very
similar to nfa, the pyridinic ring being substituted with a
phenyl ring (fig. 3a). ffa blocks  xxxg473xxx  currents in a
concentration-dependent manner, with a kd of ~120 lm,
whereas it produces an increase of clc-kb currents of
twofold (liantonio et al., 2006). to check if ffa and nfa
have overlapping binding sites, we performed the following competition experiment. at the fixed concentration of
100 lm ffa, corresponding roughly to the apparent kd for
ffa block, we changed the concentration of nfa in a
range that produces only stimulation of  xxxg473xxx  (0, 50, 100,
200 lm). we determined the effect of nfa on the block
produced by ffa. a typical experiment is shown in the
inset of figure 3b. as can be seen in figure 3b, nfa had
practically no effect on ffa-induced block, being around
50% at all nfa concentrations. this result strongly suggests that ffa binds to  xxxg473xxx  independently from its
occupation by nfa. to corrobate this conclusion, we
determined also the effect of ffa on the potentiation of
nfa. at a fixed concentration of nfa (200 lm), we
changed the concentration of ffa (50, 100, 500 lm). we
found that the potentiation produced by 200 lm nfa is not
significantly modified by the presence of ffa (fig. 3c).
these results demonstrate that occupation of the activating
binding site by nfa does not interfere with ffa-induced
block, strongly suggesting the presence of two nonoverlapping fenamate-binding sites.
competition with extracellular chloride ions
to test for a possible location of the binding site(s) of nfa
within the pore, we investigated the dependence of the
nfa-induced current activation on the extracellular cl–
concentration. applying 50 lm of nfa in high (112 mm)
and low (22 mm) extracellular chloride concentrations, we
observed only a small variation in effect (fig. 4). in fact, at
high [cl–], 50 lm nfa produced an increase of  xxxg473xxx 
currents (idrug/icontrol = 1.87 ± 0.05 at +60 mv, idrug/icontrol
= 1.78 ± 0.06 at –100 mv), slightly higher than that measured at low [cl–] (idrug/icontrol = 1.63 ± 0.08 at +60 mv,

b

idrug/icontrol = 1.28 ± 0.08 at –100 mv). clearly, extracellular cl– ions do not antagonize the nfa-mediated
potentiation, suggesting that the relevant drug-binding site
is not located within the pore.
independence of nfa-mediated potentiation of
cyclooxygenase activity
nfa is a well-known inhibitor of cycloxygenases (vane &
botting, 1998). to exclude an indirect, cyclooxygenasemediated mechanism underlying the potentiation of clcka seen after application of nfa, we tested the effect of
indomethacin, a structurally unrelated cyclooxygenase
inhibitor (vane & botting, 1998). indomethacin produced
a low-affinity block of  xxxg473xxx  with a current reduction of

channel. (a) chemical structure of ffa. (b) the block exerted by
100 lm ffa was measured in the additional presence of nfa (50,
100, 200 lm). the block is expressed as the ratio of steady-state
currents in the presence of ffa and nfa (infa+ffa) and the current
only in the presence of nfa (infa) and is plotted as a function of
[nfa]. to illustrate the experimental procedure, the inset shows the
time course of  xxxg473xxx  currents in a specific experimental condition
(100 lm nfa and 100 lm nfa + 100 lm ffa). arrows in the insets
indicate the time points at which the indicated current values were
obtained. the length of the arrows indicates the size of the
corresponding current values. horizontal scale bar = 50 ms, vertical
scale bar = 2 la. (c) potentiation produced by 200 lm nfa in the

plotted as a function of [ffa]. inset shows a typical experiment with
50 lm ffa. horizontal scale bar = 50 ms, vertical scale bar = 3 la.
the current increase seen after application of 200 lm nfa in the
continuous presence of ffa is similar to that seen in the absence of
ffa, indicating the independence of the block produced by ffa and
the potentiation produced by nfa

fig. 4 extracellular chloride only slightly affects activation of clcka by nfa. the ratio infa/icontrol is compared at 60 and –100 mv
measured in 112 mm cl- and 22 mm cl- using 50 lm nfa. the
measurements are from separate oocytes (n = 5 each condition) from
the same oocyte batches. the difference at 60 mv is marginally
significant (p = 0.031, student’s unpaired t-test), whereas the
difference at –100 mv is significant (p = 0.003, student’s unpaired
t-test)

around 29% at 200 lm (fig. 5a). fitting the data obtained
at 50 and 200 lm (fig. 5b) with equation 1 (assuming a
hill coefficient of 1) resulted in an apparent kd for indomethacin of 420 lm (fig. 5b, solid line). this concentration is well above that needed to block cyclooxygenase
activity (kalgutkar et al., 2000). more importantly, also at
lower concentrations (50 lm), no potentiation of  xxxg473xxx 
was detected (data not shown). thus, most likely, the nfamediated potentiation of  xxxg473xxx  results from a direct
interaction with the  xxxg473xxx /barttin protein complex.

provides the best fit to the data

separation of nfa-induced block and potentiation of
 xxxg473xxx 
to study in more detail the biphasic effect of nfa on clcka, we applied a particular protocol that allowed us to
separate potentiation and block. later, we will use these
results to develop a kinetic model that describes both
components. the idea of the protocol is illustrated in figure 6. we applied a train of 200-ms pulses to 60 mv and
plotted the mean current during the 60-mv period as a
function of time. the initial current level is indicated by i0.
applying 500 lm nfa with a fast and continuous perfusion
led to a gradual increase of the current to a level denoted i1
(fig. 6, arrow). fast washout of nfa produced an initial
enhancement, to an extrapolated level, denoted i2 (fig. 6,
arrow) and a slower decline to the initial current level.
complete washout of nfa-mediated potentiation required
7–9 min (liantonio et al., 2006). we interpret the biphasic
recovery after washout as follows: the potentiation induced
by nfa is probably caused by a slow conformational gating
change induced by nfa binding. washing out nfa
immediately relieves channel block, leading to the initial

123

current enhancement, while the conformational effect lasts
much longer. assuming that potentiation and block are
independent (an assumption that we will disprove later), the
results from the experiment shown in figure 6 can be formalized in the following way. the initial current is given by
i0 ¼ nipo
where n is the number of channels, i is the single channel
current and po is the open probability. we describe the
block in terms of the probability of not being blocked, pu,
and the enhancing effect by a potentiation factor, fp. thus,
the steady-state current with nfa is given by
i1 ¼ nipo fo pu
assuming that immediately after washout the block is
relieved but the potentiation initially persists, the initial
current after washout is given by
i2 ¼ nipo fp
thus, we obtain the unblock probability, pu, by
pu ¼ i1 =i2
and the potentiation factor, fp, by
fp ¼ i2 =io
figure 7a plots pu as a function of the nfa concentration. the data are clearly not well fitted by a 1:1 binding

j membrane biol (2007) 216:73–82

79

nfa has to take gating into account. for simplicity, we
assume the presence of only one open and one closed state.
thus, in the absence of nfa the channel is described by
o (model 0) and the total open probability in
c
the absence of nfa is described by one parameter, po. the
simplest model, with one nfa-binding site, is thus given
by

(model 1)
because we are interested only in the predictions of the
steady-state properties and assuming microscopic reversibility, we cannot determine the connectivity of the model.
for this reason, we draw all kinetic models with the minimal number of connections. model 1 is characterized by
two additional parameters, the binding constant of the
closed state, kc, and the binding constant of the open state,
ko. if we assume that state on is nonconducting, i.e.,
blocked, model 1 predicts that nfa can only reduce the
current but not enhance it. if, instead, we assume that state
on is conducting and if ko < kc, model 1 predicts
potentiation but no block at higher [nfa]. if ko > kc,
model 1 predicts only inhibition irrespective of whether on
is conducting or not. thus, we need at least one additional
binding site:

curve (fig. 7a, dashed line) but are well described by a
langmuir isotherm with a hill coefficient of about 2 and an
apparent kd of 500 lm (fig. 7a, solid line). this suggests
that two molecules of nfa are needed to block  xxxg473xxx 
currents. the potentiation factor, fp, shows a more complex, biphasic dependence on [nfa] (fig. 7b). potentiation has a maximal value of 3.8-fold at 500 lm nfa but
decreases again and levels off at a value of 2.7-fold for
larger [nfa].

cna cnb ona onb
(model 2)
model 2 is characterized by four binding constants, kca,
kcb, koa and kob, and the two binding sites (a and b)
cannot be simultaneously occupied. as above, both conformationally ‘‘open’’ nfa-bound states (i.e., ona and
onb) cannot be nonconducting or conducting in order to
predict a biphasic concentration-response relationship.
assume that ona is conducting and onb is blocked. the
predictions of model 2 for the parameters pu and fp, which
are operationally defined as illustrated in figure 6, can be
calculated based on the following reasoning. without nfa,
the current is proportional to po. in the presence of nfa, in
steady state, the current is proportional to p(o) + p(ona),
whereas initially after washout of nfa also channels in
state onb contribute to the current. thus,

because nfa is able to increase the open probability by
more than a factor of 3, a model that describes the action of

the calculation of the steady-state occupation probabilities
of the various states is straightforward. for example, all
occupation probabilities can be expressed in terms of p(o).
for p(c) we simply have

model 3 provides a reasonable description of our data if,
and only if, we assume that states ona and onb are conducting, whereas the channel is blocked when both binding
sites are occupied. very similar to the procedure described
above for model 2, we easily obtain expressions for the
unblock probability and the potentiation factor for model 3:

where c is the concentration of nfa. similar expressions
can be found for all other states. using finally the condition
that all occupation probabilities must sum to 1 and
inserting the expressions in the above equations for pu
and fp, we obtain these quantities in terms of the binding
constants:
pu ¼

however, these equations do not fit our data (not

the best fit of these equations to the data of figure 7 is
reported in figure 8 (solid lines). the model provides a
good description of the data. as an internal test of
consistency, we calculated also the prediction of the
model for the direct steady-state concentration-response
dependence (given simply by the product pu * fp; fig. 8,
dashed line). again, the model is consistent with the
experimental data. the parameters obtained from the fit are
reported in table 1. as can be seen from the values, the
model predicts that nfa binds to the closed state with
lower affinity (kca > koa and kcb > kob). moreover, for
the open channel, the two binding sites have a very
different affinity. clearly, within the model, block and
potentiation are not independent from each other.
nevertheless, the operationally defined parameters pu and
fp contain useful information about the kinetic mechanism.
in particular, the unblock probability, pu, correctly reflects
the open channel block in that this parameter is
independent from the nfa-binding properties of the
closed state.

discussion
nfa exhibits a complicated, biphasic effect on the kidney
cl- channel  xxxg473xxx . concentrations between 50 and
500 lm of nfa produce an increase of  xxxg473xxx  currents,
whereas larger concentrations lead to current block (liantonio et al., 2006). in contrast, the rat homologue  xxxg473xxx  is
simply blocked by nfa in an apparent 1:1 manner. in this
report, we have approached several questions regarding the
mechanism of nfa action. first of all, we can practically
exclude the possibility that the blocking action of nfa is

mediated by the same binding site at which 3-phenyl-cpp
acts. 3-phenyl-cpp block is sensitive to extracellular cland to a point mutation of n68, a residue that points its side
chain into the extracellular pore vestibule (picollo et al.,
2004). in contrast, nfa block is almost unaffected by
mutating n68 in  xxxg473xxx  (this work) as well as in  xxxg473xxx 
(liantonio et al., 2006). nevertheless, the slight sensitivity
of nfa block to mutations of n68 indicates a certain small
influence of the charge at position 68 on nfa block,
suggesting that nfa binds at a more external location
within the pore.
even more clearly, our present results show that the
nfa site that is responsible for  xxxg473xxx  potentiation is not
identical to the 3-phenyl-cpp site and that it is not located
deep in the pore. three lines of evidence support this
conclusion. first, nfa potentiation is not influenced by
mutating n68 (liantonio et al., 2006). second, nfa
potentiation is independent of extracellular cl-. third,
ffa, a  xxxg473xxx  blocker that binds to the 3-phenyl-cpp site

(liantonio et al., 2006), does not compete with the
potentiation mediated by nfa. the finding that nfa does
not bind to the previously identified 3-phenyl-cpp site
(picollo et al., 2004) correlates well with the molecular
properties of the nfa molecule compared to 3-phenyl-cpp
and ffa. according to the modeling studies of liantonio
et al. (2006), nfa has a rigid, coplanar geometry of its
aromatic rings. in contrast, 3-phenyl-cpp and ffa are
forced to adopt a noncoplanar configuration, likely being
thus also more flexible than nfa. even though also the
rings of nfa will rotate at some frequency, we speculate
that nfa is too rigid to be easily accommodated in the
narrow part of the extracellular vestibule, whereas 3-phenyl-cpp and ffa can reach the deeper binding site.
the third major conclusion that can be drawn from our
detailed analysis of nfa action on  xxxg473xxx  is that two nfa
molecules can bind to the channel. the model contains
several simplifying assumptions. in particular, we assumed
the presence of only two gating states. nevertheless, the
model makes several interesting qualitative predictions. the
modeling suggests that the two binding sites are not equivalent. thus, most likely, each protopore of the homodimeric
 xxxg473xxx  channel bears two binding sites. the higher-affinity
site (site ‘‘b’’ in model 3) is mostly responsible for the
potentiation of the channel, characterized by a binding
constant of 80 lm in the open state. one of the most
intriguing features of the model is that block is achieved only
if two nfa molecules are bound. the model predicts only a
very small positive cooperativity of the two sites in the open
state: the binding constants of both sites are roughly twofold
smaller if the other site is already occupied. in contrast, in the
closed conformation, binding is highly cooperative: binding
constants decrease by a factor of around 270 if the other site
is occupied. this points to a strong influence of the conformational change on nfa binding.
the ability of nfa to potentiate  xxxg473xxx  (and clc-kb)
relies on the fact that the open probability of these channels
is considerably smaller than 1. the value obtained by our
model fitting (po = 2.8 * 10–4) cannot be considered reliable. in fact, the predictions of the model are almost
independent of the exact value of po, as long as it is small.
for small po, equation b is reduced to

at saturating nfa concentrations. the fact that clc-kb is
more strongly potentiated by nfa than  xxxg473xxx  (liantonio

123

82

et al., 2006) indicates that, for this channel, the effect of the
conformational change on nfa binding is even larger. in
contrast, the finding that  xxxg473xxx  is not potentiated by nfa
suggests that, for this channel, the gating conformation has
little influence on nfa binding. the apparent 1:1 binding
in the case of  xxxg473xxx  revealed by the langmuir isotherm
fit suggests either that for this channel binding of one nfa
molecule, e.g., to the ‘‘b’’ site, is sufficient for block or that
the binding constants of the two sites have values such that
the block appears to be simpler, clearly a mathematical
possibility given by equations a and b.
it is not clear which gating process is affected by nfa.
single-channel measurements are indispensable to find out
if nfa alters the open probability of the individual protopores. alternatively, clc-k channel open probability
may be dominated by a common gate that acts simultaneously on both pores of the double-barreled channel, in
analogy to the slow gate of the clc-0 channel (pusch &
jentsch, 2005).
it will be highly interesting to identify the amino acids
that are involved in the nfa binding sites. this may allow
a better understanding of the molecular mechanism of
nfa-mediated potentiation and the development of higheraffinity potentiators. such drugs are of considerable medical potential, e.g., for the treatment of bartter’s syndrome
type iii.
