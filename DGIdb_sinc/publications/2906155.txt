abstract. barbiturates have been reported to augment benzodiazepine receptor affinity in vitro, but their effects in
vivo are uncertain. we determined benzodiazepine receptor
binding in vivo by specific uptake of [ah]ro15-1788 after
barbiturate administration. pentobarbital (30 mg/kg) increased receptor binding in cerebral cortex and cerebellum
at 30 rain after injection, with a peak effect occurring at
1 h after dosage, and a return to control levels at 2 h. specific binding was increased at 1 h after pentobarbital administration in a dose-dependent fashion (7.5-90 mg/kg). pentobarbital at doses up to 30 mg/kg failed to alter nonspecific
binding, but at doses of 60 mg/kg increases in nonspeeific
binding were observed. the increases in specific binding
observed after barbiturate administration were most likely
due to a change in apparent receptor aff'mity, as determined
by administration of varying doses of clonazepam to pentobarbital-treated (30 mg/kg) animals. the order of potency
of a series of barbiturates in augmenting benzodiazepine
receptor binding in cerebral cortex and cerebellum in vivo
was:  xxxd3183xxx  > pentobarbital >  xxxd158xxx  > phenobarbital >  xxxd285xxx . the same relative rank order of potency
exists for the anesthetic/hypnotic activity of these barbiturates. these data suggest that barbiturates increase the apparent affinity of benzodiazepine receptors in vivo; unlike
their in vitro actions, these alterations can be detected with
a receptor antagonist.

benzodiazepines bind to specific receptors within the central nervous system that are functionally and structurally
associated with the gabaa receptor (haefely et al. 1985).
this benzodiazepine-gaba receptor complex also includes
an associated chloride ion channel with binding sites for
drugs such as the convulsants  xxxd2947xxx  and the anesthetic
barbiturates (chweh et al. 1985). electrophysiological studies indicate that barbiturates may exert at least part of
their central effects by increasing the mean channel open
time of the chloride ion channel in this complex (mcdonald
and barker 1979; barker etal. 1984; study and barker
1984). in addition, numerous studies using brain membrane

preparations in vitro have established that certain barbiturates promote benzodiazepine binding to this complex. barbiturates appear to increase the apparent affinity at the
benzodiazepine receptor, presumably via allosteric modulation of the receptor (leeb-lundberg et al. 1980; davis and
ticku 1981 ; loeb-lundberg and olsen 1982; skolnick et al.
1982; ticku and maksay 1983). the effect of barbiturates
on benzodiazepine receptor binding is dependent on the
presence of chloride or other permeable anions, there is
a clear stereoselectivity of action, and barbiturates exert
an effect even after maximal stimulation by gaba. in addition, barbiturates can be distinguished based on their effects
on benzodiazepine receptor binding: those which cause essentially full enhancement of benzodiazepine receptor awmity, such as pentobarbital; those which cause partial enhancement, such as (+)-liexobarbital; and those which
cause little or no enhancement, such as phenobarbital.
while these in vitro studies demonstrate a clear enhancement of benzodiazepine binding to the benzodiazepine receptor by barbiturates, they may not completely reflect the
situation in vivo (schliebs et al. 1983). results of in vitro
binding studies may be affected by tissue preparation, assay
conditions such as temperature and buffer composition, radioligand characteristics, and methods of assessment of
bound versus free ligand (costa et al. 1979; fisher et al.
1986). little information is available concerning effects of
barbiturates on benzodiazepine binding in vivo, although
one study reported an increase in [3h]-ro15-1788 uptake
after pentobarbital administration using ex vivo methods
(koe et al. 1987). several studies have addressed effects of
chronic barbiturate treatment. two groups found no
change in diazepam binding in rats treated with phenobarbital or  xxxd285xxx  (m6hler et al. 1978; rosenberg and chiu
1979), while another group found a decrease in receptor
number after treatment with phenobarbital (sonawane
et al. 1980). these studies did not address acute effects of
barbiturates in vivo, nor did they use barbiturates found
to be active in in vitro studies. also, these studies used
in vitro membrane preparations to assess benzodiazepine
receptor binding.
techniques to assess in vivo benzodiazepine receptor
binding may avoid [imitations imposed by in vitro methods.
these techniques involve administration of a tracer quantity of a high affinity radioligand with subsequent determination of retained radioactivity in a given tissue (e.g., brain
regions) (goeders and kuhar 1985; miller et al. 1987a).

386
nonspecific binding is determined by pretreatment with a
saturating dose of nonradioactive ligand followed by administration of the radioligand. recent studies of the in
vivo labeling of benzodiazepine receptors are in close agreement with results obtained via ex vivo and in vitro autoradiographic methods, where evidence for stercoselectivity,
saturability and reversibility of receptor occupancy have
been demonstrated (goeders and kuhar 1985; miller et al.
1987a). in the present study, we used an in vivo technique
to examine the effects of acute barbiturate administration
of benzodiazepine receptor binding in vivo.

materials and methods

materials. male cd-1 mice, 6~8 weeks of age, were obtained from charles river laboratories (wellesley, mass),
housed with a 12 h light/dark cycle, and fed laboratory
chow and water ad lib.  xxxd285xxx  and phenobarbital were
obtained from sigma (st. louis, mo).  xxxd158xxx , clonazepam, desmethylflunitrazepam, ro15-1788, and  xxxd3183xxx  were kindly provided by their respective manufacturers. [3h]-ro15-1788, specific activity 81 ci/mmol, and protosol were obtained from new england nuclear (boston,
mass). scintillation fluid (hp) was obtained from beckman
(fulierton, calif). all other reagents were obtained from
standard commercial sources.
barbiturate administration. benzodiazepine receptor occupancy (see below) was determined under the following conditions:
1. administration of varying doses of several barbiturates
intraperitoneally (i.p.) 1 h prior to administering radioligand.
2. administration ofpentobarbital, 30 mg/kg i.p. at varying
periods (30 min-3 h) prior to administration of radioligand.
3. administration of pentobarbital, 30 mg/kg, followed
20 min later by varying doses of clonazepam (see below,
receptor affinity).
all barbiturates were given in a volume of 0.15 ml saline.
in some cases, barbiturates were initially dissolved in ethanol, and final ethanol concentrations were always less than
5%.

determination of benzodiazepine receptor occupancy. receptor occupancy was determined by a modification (miller
et al. 1987a) of the method of goeders and kuhar (1985).
at the appropriate time after barbiturate dosage, animals
were injected intravenously via the tail vein with 3 ~ci [3h]ro15-1788 in a volume of 0.15 mi saline. after 20 rain,
animals were sacrificed by decapitation and brains were
dissected on ice. brain regions were then weighed and
placed in scintillation vials to which 3 ml protosol was added. vials were incubated at 40°c for 24 h. scintillation
fluid, 10 ml, was subsequently added to each vial and vials
were allowed to sit at room temperature for 24 h. samples
were then counted by conventional scintillation spectrometry. control animals were treated with vehicle containing
the maximum ethanol concentration. for nonspecific binding, animals were treated with a saturating dose of clonazepam (5 mg/kg i.p.). after 30 rain, [3h]-ro15-1788 was in-

jected and tissue processed as above. receptor occupancy
was calculated as follows:

to ascertain whether barbiturate administration alters
the uptake of rol 5-1788, animals were pretreated with barbiturates and subsequently administered unlabeled ro151788 (6 mg/kg) rather than labeled compound. experiments
were conducted as above, except that cortices were hemisected, with one section reserved for determination of
ro15-1788 concentrations by gas-liquid chromatography
(lister et al. 1984).

benzodiazepine receptor affinity. animals were pretreated
with doses of clonazepam 10 rain after barbiturate injection.
experiments were then carried out as above, except that
cerebral cortices were dissected into approximately equal
parts and approximately one-half of the tissue was reserved
for analysis of clonazepam concentrations by gas-liquid
chromatography (miller et al. 1987b). the remainder of
the tissue was analyzed for receptor occupancy as above.
brain concentrations of benzodiazepines and gaba. after
weighing, brain tissue was placed in 0.5-1 ml 0.25 m borate
buffer, ph 8.3. tissue was homogenized with a polytron
homogenizer (setting 7, 4 strokes) and the homogenate was
frozen at - 2 0 ° c until assay. assays for clonazepam and
ro15-1788 were performed using gas-liquid chromatographic techniques as previously described (lister et al.
1984; miller et al. 1987b).
for gaba determinations, animals were decapitated
into liquid nitrogen, cerebral cortices dissected, and gaba
determined by enzymatic methods (jakoby 1962).
statistical analyses. comparisons among multiple groups
were performed using analysis of variance, with subsequent
correction for multiple comparisons. comparisons between
two groups were performed using student's t-test or the
wilcoxon test.
results

receptor occupancy after pentobarbital treatment. in vivo
benzodiazepine receptor binding increases in the cerebral
cortex in a dose-dependent fashion (7.5-90 mg/kg) after
pretreatment with pentobarbital (fig. 1). lower doses of
pentobarbital cause a small but nonsil, nificant increase in
benzodiazepine receptor binding. nonspecific binding is
similar to untreated controls after pentobarbital up to
30 mg/kg. however, the nonspecific binding in the cerebral
cortex increases approximately 40% at a pentobarbital dose
of 60 mg/kg or greater. results of treatment with a flxed
dose of pentobarbital, 30 mg/kg, for varying time periods
are presented in fig. 2. benzodiazepine receptor binding
increases in animals pretreated for 30 rain and is maximal
in those pretreated for 1 h. receptor binding returns to
control levels at 2 h after treatment and remains similar
to controls at 3 h after treatment.

results of benzodiazepine binding in cerebral cortex for
animals treated with pentobarbital,  xxxd3183xxx , and  xxxd158xxx  are presented in fig. 4a. as noted, benzodiazepine
receptor binding in pentobarbital-treated animals increased
at doses greater than 7.5 mg/kg. there was a greater increase in benzodiazepine receptor binding in animals
treated with  xxxd3183xxx ; binding was increased in animals
treated with doses as low as 2.5 mg/kg. receptor binding
was also increased in animals treated with  xxxd158xxx , but
significant increases were seen only at doses of 30 mg/kg
or greater. absolute increases in receptor binding were greatest with  xxxd3183xxx , less with pentobarbital, and less but
still greater than controls with  xxxd158xxx .
results of benzodiazepine receptor binding in the cerebral cortex of animals treated with phenobarbital and  xxxd285xxx  are presented in fig. 4b. receptor binding in animals
treated with phenobarbital was similar to controls following
doses from 2.5 to 90 mg/kg. at higher doses (120 and
150 mg/kg) receptor binding was substantially increased
compared to controls. nonspecific binding was similar to
controls. for  xxxd285xxx , receptor binding was similar to controls in doses from 60 to 180 mg/kg. however, specific (but
not nonspecific) binding was increased compared to controis in animals treated with 210 mg/kg.

there were no differences in cortical clonazepam concentrations in barbiturate-treated animals versus controls (data
not shown). results of receptor occupancy in animals pretreated with pentobarbital 30 mg/kg and then subsequently
injected with varying doses of clonazepam are presented
in fig. 3. sigmoidal relationships characteristic of receptormediated phenomena (holford and sheiner 1981) are present for both barbiturate-treated and control animals. the
data points can be fitted to the equation: y = x a / ( b + x a)
(correlation coefficient greater than 0.9 for both), and an
ic5o value can be calculated. for control animals, the icso
is 22.8 ng/g, with a 95% confidence interval of 19.4~26.1.
for pentobarbital-treated animals, the ic~o is 13.5 ng/g,
with a 95% confidence interval of 12.4~14.6. the difference
is highly significant (t=5.87, d f = 15, p<0.001). the data
can also be expressed as a hill plot and an apparent kd

to determine whether altered brain uptake o f ro15-1788
could account for a p p a r e n t changes in receptor occupancy,
animals received unlabeled ro15-1788 (6 mg/kg) after pretreatment with pentobarbital, 30 mg/kg. there were no significant differences in ro15-1788 concentrations in the cerebral cortex in barbiturate-treated animals c o m p a r e d to

n u m e r o u s studies have examined the effects o f barbiturates
on benzodiazepine binding in brain membranes in vitro.
several groups have reported that " a n e s t h e t i c " barbiturates such as p e n t o b a r b i t a l enhanced benzodiazepine binding to receptor sites (leeb-lundberg et al. 1980; davis and
ticku 1981). this enhancement is stereospecific, and was
present both in extensively washed p r e p a r a t i o n s and in
those in which benzodiazepine binding had already been
stimulated by g a b a . the observed enhancement o f benzodiazepine binding by barbiturates is blocked by  xxxd2947xxx .
thus, barbiturates a p p e a r to enhance benzodiazepine binding in vitro by an interaction at the  xxxd2947xxx  binding site
on the gabaa receptor complex. a u g m e n t a t i o n of binding
was found i n various brain regions, including cortex, cerebellum, hippocampus, and corpus callosum (skolnick et al.
1982). it should be noted that these studies used substantially different techniques in m e m b r a n e preparation, involving b o t h p1 and p2 p r e p a r a t i o n s and varying degrees o f
washing to remove g a b a .
two other m a j o r conclusions can be drawn from these
in vitro studies. first, several groups o f barbiturates can
be distinguished based on interactions with benzodiazepine
binding in vitro (leeb-lundberg et al. 1980; l e e b - l u n d berg and olsen 1982). the first group, exemplified by pen-

389
tobarbital, causes full enhancement of benzodiazepine binding. other agents in this category include  xxxd3183xxx  and
 xxxd158xxx . a second class includes barbiturates with less
effect on benzodiazepine binding, such as (+)- xxxd2279xxx 
and (-)- xxxd2569xxx . a third class comprises agents
which have little effect on their own but reverse the enhancing effect of pentobarbital. these include phenobarbital and
 xxxd2591xxx . in addition, these studied indicate that barbiturates exert their effects via an increase in affinity for benzodiazepine binding, that is, a decrease in kd. no effect was
seen on the number of benzodiazepine receptor sites in
preparations using various barbiturates (davis and ticku
1981 ; skolnick et al. 1982; ticku and maksay 1983).
results from electrophysiologieal studies largely complement the effects of barbiturates on gaba receptor-coupled responses (macdonald and barker 1979; barker et al.
1984; study and barker 1984). in these studies, the aliphatic
barbiturates such as pentobarbital and  xxxd3183xxx  enhanced the recurrent inhibition and iontophoretic responses
to gaba in various neuronal preparations. in some preparations, phenobarbital also had an effect, although substantially less than pentobarbital (gallagher et al. 1981 ; shultz
and macdonald 1981). in other preparations, phenobarbital had little effect on recurrent inhibition (iadarola et al.
1985).
in vivo studies of receptor occupancy avoid certain limitations imposed by in vitro methods. results of in vitro
binding may be affected by tissue preparation, assay conditions such as temperature and buffer composition, radioligand characteristics, and methods of assessment of bound
versus free ligand (schliebs et al. 1983; haefely et al. 1985).
in particular, tissue preparation may result in varying concentrations of gaba which in turn can substantially alter
benzodiazepine receptor binding (fisher etal. 1986).
especially with regard to barbiturate effects, ion concentrations such as chloride are of considerable importance (costa
et al. 1979). also, binding characteristics of ligands at 37 ° c
appear to be different from those at low temperatures used
in most in vitro studies (quast et al. 1982). in vivo binding
techniques provide high specific activity while preserving
physiological temperature, buffer, and gaba composition.
results of the present study indicate that barbiturateinduced enhancement of benzodiazepine receptor binding
can be demonstrated in the cortex and cerebellum of the
intact animal. the effect is evident at 30 rain after intraperitoneal pentobarbital, and appears to be maximal 1 h after
administration. the effect decreases rapidly, and by 2 h
after dosage receptor binding is similar to controls. further,
the effect of barbiturates is dose dependent, with enhancement of benzodiazepine binding observed at pentobarbital
doses as low as 7.5 mg/kg, and increasing with doses of
up to 90 mg/kg. these results are similar to those reported
by koe et al. (1987) in an ex vivo study using pentobarbital,
320 gmol/kg, at 1 h.
the augmentation of benzodiazepine binding by barbiturates could be due to increased receptor number, increased receptor affinity, or increased delivery of tracer radioligand to receptor sites. since barbiturates have been
reported to alter cerebral blood flow and perhaps bloodbrain barrier permeability (albrecht etal. 1985; harvey
1985), we measured concentrations of ro15-1788 in the
cerebral cortex after administration of a saturating dose
of this ligand preceded by barbiturate administration. concentrations of ro15-1788 in cerebral cortex were similar

in animals pretreated with pentobarbital, 30 mg/kg, and
control animals. while this dose of ro15-1788 is substantially greater than the tracer doses used in our radioligand
studies, uptake of ro15-1788 into brain is proportional to
dose (lister et al. 1984), making it unlikely that changes
in delivery of radioligand can account for the increase in
receptor binding seen at doses of 30 mg/kg or less. nonspecific binding increases in animnls treated with doses of pentobarbital 60 mg/kg or greater. at these high doses, it is
possible that effects on specific binding occur in parallel
and that the overall effect of pentobarbital is in part due
to nonspecific changes in blood flow and to corresponding
kinetics of association and/or dissociation. at doses of
30 mg/kg and below, nonspecific binding is not altered.
coupled with the evidence above concerning unlabeled ligand, these data indicate that pentobarbital effects on benzodiazepine receptor binding are specific at least up to doses
of 30 mg/kg. in addition, the lack of change in clonazepam
concentrations in cerebral cortex after pentobarbital treatment argues against a kinetic explanation for changes in
radioligand binding. enhancement of benzodiazepine binding is unlikely to be due to dissociation properties of barbi- ,
turates, since there is no correlation between pka values
and activity in enhancing receptor binding (toon et al.
1984). lipophilicity appears to correlate with binding enhancement, indicating that barbiturates act indirectly via
an effect on membrane lipids, or that lipophilicity is a measure of hydrophobic interactions with a specific membrane
receptor (toon and rowland 1983).
binding of benzodiazepine receptor agonlsts in vitro and
in vivo may be affected by gaba concentrations (miller
et al. 1988). to determine whether barbiturate-related effects on binding were due to changes in gaba concentrations, cortical gaba was measured in pentobarbitaltreated (30 mg/kg) and control mice. the lack of differences
in gaba concentrations argues against a gaba effect
to explain the observed increases in binding.
to determine whether changes in receptor aft'mity explain enhanced receptor binding, we examined the binding
characteristics of clonazepam in control mice and mice
treated with pentobarbital (30 mg/kg). prior studies indicate that characteristic sigmoidal functions relate receptor
occupancy to tissue concentrations for several benzodiazepines (miller et al. 1987a) and measures of affinity such
as ic5o can be estimated. pentobarbital treatment substantially decreased ic~o and ka for clonazepam compared to
controls. while receptor number cannot be measured directly in vivo, the bulk of the increase in binding in cortex
can be attributed to increased apparent affinity. however,
it is possible that effects on both apparent affinity and receptor number are present. the fact that barbiturates fail
to increase the apparent aft'mity at the benzodiazepine receptor measured with [3h]-ro15-1788 in vitro, but augment
binding measured with the same ligand in vivo, remains
unexplained. however, it is clear that agonist affinity, measured by clonazepam displacement, increases after barbiturate administration in vivo.
in both the cerebral cortex and cerebellum,  xxxd3183xxx 
and  xxxd158xxx  increased benzodiazepine receptor binding
in a dose-dependent fashion.  xxxd3183xxx  was substantially
more potent than pentobarbital, causing increases in receptor binding at doses down to 2.5 mg/kg. conversely,  xxxd158xxx  was less potent than pentobarbital, with increases
in receptor binding occurring at 30 mg/kg or greater. phen-

390
obarbital enhanced benzodiazepine receptor binding, but
only at relatively high doses, 120 and 150 mg/kg in cortex,
and 150 mg/kg in cerebellum. this order of potency for
these barbiturates in vivo is similar to the results obtained
in vitro.
the substantial difference in potency between phenobarbital and  xxxd285xxx  and the aliphatic barbiturates reflects
marked differences in potency seen in some electrophysiological studies (gallagher et al. 1981 ; iadarola et al. 1985).
thus, we have demonstrated that both aliphatic a n d nonaliphatic barbiturates can increase benzodiazepine receptor
binding in vivo. these results do not indicate that the two
types of barbiturates can be completely distinguished based
on effects on benzodiazepine binding.
the effects of barbiturates on benzodiazepine receptor
binding indicate close interactions between benzodiazepine
and barbiturate binding sites. it seems less likely that barbiturates produce their pharmacological effects by altering
benzodiazepine binding sites. a n assumption more clearly
supported by electrophysiological studies is that barbiturates exert at least some of their effects by altering the
function of the chloride channel associated with the benzodiazepine/gaba receptor complex. our results confirm
that such actions occur at pharmacologically relevant doses
in the intact animal.
