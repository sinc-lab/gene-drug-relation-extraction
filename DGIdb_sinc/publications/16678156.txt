abstract
opioid addiction modulates the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (erk) leading to synaptic plasticity in the brain.  xxxg1369xxx /2 are stimulated
by mitogen-activated protein kinase kinases ( xxxg1361xxx /2), but little is known about the regulation of mek activity by opioid drugs. this study was
designed to assess the acute effects of selective mu-, delta-, and kappa-opioid receptor agonists, as well as those induced by chronic morphine and opioid
withdrawal, on the content of phosphorylated  xxxg1361xxx /2 in the rat brain. sufentanil (1–30 mug/kg, 30–120 min) induced dose- and time-dependent
increases in  xxxg1361xxx /2 phosphorylation in the cerebral cortex and corpus striatum (30–177%) through a naloxone-sensitive mechanism. morphine
(100 mg/kg, 2 h) also augmented  xxxg1361xxx /2 phosphorylation in the both brain regions (50–70%). similarly, the selective delta-opioid receptor agonist
snc-80 (10 mg/kg, 30 min) increased  xxxg1361xxx /2 activity in the cortex (60%) that was antagonized by naltrindole. in contrast, the selective kappa-opioid
receptor agonist (−)-u50488h (10 mg/kg, 30–120 min) did not modify significantly  xxxg1361xxx /2 phosphorylation in the cortex. chronic morphine
(10–100 mg/kg, 5 days) was not associated with alterations in the content of phosphorylated  xxxg1361xxx /2 in the brain (induction of tachyphylaxis to
the acute effects). in morphine-dependent rats, however, naloxone (2 mg/kg)-precipitated withdrawal (2–6 h) induced robust increases in  xxxg1361xxx /2
phosphorylation in cortex (27–49%) and striatum (83–123%). spontaneous opioid withdrawal (24 h) in morphine-dependent rats did not alter
 xxxg1361xxx /2 activity in the brain. the findings may be relevant in the context of the pivotal role played by the mek/erk pathway in various longlasting forms of synaptic plasticity associated with opioid addiction.

1. introduction
the opioid receptors modulate many signaling pathways in
the brain, including several kinase cascades such as those
containing protein kinases a (pka) and c (pkc), calmodulin
kinase ii and, more recently, the extracellular signal-regulated
kinase (erk)/mitogen-activated protein (map) kinase system
(law et al., 2000; williams et al., 2001). the core module of
the erk signaling pathway consists of three kinases that
phosphorylate each other sequentially. thus,  xxxg1369xxx /2 are
activated by p45- xxxg1361xxx  and p46- xxxg1362xxx  (map/erk kinases

or map kinase kinases) (review in yoon and seger, 2006),
which in turn are phosphorylated by c- xxxg1924xxx , a kinase of the
raf family (baccarini, 2005). c- xxxg1924xxx  is initially stimulated
by different small gtp-binding proteins likewise ras (grewal
et al., 1999, baccarini, 2005). activated  xxxg1369xxx /2 phosphorylate and regulate many cytosolic and nuclear targets (yoon
and seger, 2006) to alter gene expression and modulate,
among other events, synaptic plasticity in the brain (pearson
et al., 2001; pouysségur and lenormand, 2003). it is
generally accepted that  xxxg1361xxx /2 (dual-specificity protein
kinases that share 78% amino acid identity) are equally
competent activators of  xxxg1369xxx /2 (chang and karin, 2001;
robinson et al., 2002), which are the only known substrates
of  xxxg1361xxx /2 (pearson et al., 2001). however, increasing

evidences suggest that  xxxg1369xxx /2 can be also activated via some
mek-independent pathway (band and posner, 1997; bapat et
al., 2001; barry et al., 2001; tapinos and rambukkana,
2005), as well as by other direct activators (tapinos and
rambukkana, 2005). transgenic mice models expressing an
active form of  xxxg1361xxx  (tissue/organ-restricted) have revealed a
number of substantial effects in various tissues related to
proliferation and differentiation phenomena (scholl et al.,
2005), which illustrates the physiological relevance of the
map/erk kinases.
opioid-induced activation of  xxxg1369xxx /2 was first described
in cells expressing the transfected opioid receptors (li and
chang, 1996; fukuda et al., 1996; belcheva et al., 1998;
schulz et al., 2004). human neuroblastoma sk-n-sh and
sh-sy5y cells, which endogenously express mu/delta-opioid
receptors, also exhibited a rapid and transient opioid-mediated
phosphorylation of  xxxg1369xxx /2 enzymes (trapaidze et al., 2000;
ferrer-alcón et al., 2004). in these in vitro studies, the main
mechanism for coupling opioid receptors with the erk
pathway was shown to involve the activation of ras via gbetagamma
subunits (belcheva et al., 1998) that are associated with gi/o
protein activity (i.e., sensitive to pertussis toxin) (audet et al.,
2005). other mechanisms by which opioid receptors could
regulate the erk pathway involve the modulation of pka
and pkc signaling systems (luttrell and luttrell, 2003;
belcheva et al., 2005).
chronic morphine in rats and opioid addiction in humans
have been shown to be associated with down-regulation of
 xxxg1369xxx /2 activity in the various brain regions (schulz and
höllt, 1998; ferrer-alcón et al., 2004; muller and unterwald,
2004). in contrast, little attention has been paid to the in vivo
short-term regulation of  xxxg1369xxx /2 in brains of laboratory
animals after the activation of mu-, delta- or kappa-opioid peptide
(mop-, dop-, kop-) receptors. thus, acute morphine
treatment in mice was shown to induce opposite brain
region-specific modulations of phosphorylated  xxxg1369xxx /2 (eitan
et al., 2003; valjent et al., 2004). acute morphine in rats has
been associated with up-regulation of  xxxg1369xxx /2 phosphorylation in the cerebral cortex (ferrer-alcón et al., 2004), but
other studies with this opioid failed to modulate the content of
phosphorylated  xxxg1369xxx /2 in various rat brain regions, including
the cortex and the ventral tegmental area (berhow et al.,
1996; schulz and höllt, 1998). in addition, acute morphine
was reported to induce down-regulation of phosphorylated
 xxxg1369xxx /2 in the rat nucleus accumbens but not in the caudate–
putamen (muller and unterwald, 2004). notably, these
conflicting in vivo studies have exclusively dealt with the
effects of morphine, a low efficacy mu-opioid receptor agonist
(williams et al., 2001), on the modulation of  xxxg1369xxx /2, the
classical map kinase, and very little is known (see ortiz et
al., 1995; lesscher et al., 2003) about the short- and longterm regulation of  xxxg1361xxx /2 activity by opioid drugs in the
brain.
therefore, this study was designed to assess the acute effects
of selective mu-, delta-, and kappa-opioid receptor agonists, as well as
those induced by chronic morphine and opioid withdrawal, on
the content of phosphorylated  xxxg1361xxx /2 in the rat cerebral frontal

cortex and corpus striatum, two brain regions relevant to opioid
addiction (see ferrer-alcón et al., 2004; valjent et al., 2005).
2. materials and methods
2.1. animals and treatments
adult male sprague-dawley rats (250–300 g) were used.
the rats were housed under controlled environmental conditions (20 ± 2 °c, 70% humidity and 12 h light/dark cycle) with
free access to standard diet and tap water. the rats were treated
in accordance with the european convention for the protection
of vertebrate animals used for experimental and other
scientific purposes (directive 86/609/eec), and in agreement
with the bioethical committee of the university of the balearic
islands. the animals were handled in the previous days of the
experiments to reduce stress on the day of drug administration.
for the acute drug treatments, the rats received single
subcutaneous (s.c.) or intraperitoneal (i.p.) injections of the
various opioids as follows: dose–response for sufentanil (1, 2.5,
5, 15 and 30 mug/kg, s.c., for 30 min); time–course for sufentanil
(15 mug/kg, s.c., for 5, 10, 15, 30, 60 and 120 min); dose–
response for morphine (10, 30 and 100 mg/kg, i.p., for
120 min); time–course for the selective delta-opioid receptor
agonist snc-80 (10 mg/kg, i.p., for 30, 60 and 120 min); time–
course for the selective kappa-opioid receptor agonist (−)-u50488h
(10 mg/kg, i.p., for 30, 60 and 120 min). in another series of
experiments, groups of rats received single doses of the
nonselective opioid receptor antagonist naloxone (10 and
100 mg/kg, i.p.) for 120 min, or naloxone (10 mg/kg, i.p.)
90 min before sufentanil (15 mug/kg, s.c., for 30 min), or a single
dose of the selective delta-opioid receptor antagonist naltrindole
(5 mg/kg, i.p.) 30 min before snc-80 (10 mg/kg, i.p., for
30 min). control rats received 0.9% saline vehicle (1 ml/kg) or
 xxxd1896xxx  (dmso, 1 ml/kg, in the case of snc-80),
and the animals were killed by decapitation at the indicated
times. the doses of the different opioids (sufentanil, morphine,
snc-80 and u50488h) were chosen from previous studies that
reported clear neurochemical effects in rats (garcía-fuster et al.,
in press) with little alteration in gross behavior (e.g. doses of
snc-80 higher than 10 mg/kg induce convulsant activity and
catalepsy; see broom et al., 2002). the doses of sufentanil used
(except 1 mug/kg) are extra-analgesic in the clinical setting, and
the opioid induced short-lived sedation and frozen postures in
most rats (see also serra et al., 2003).
for the chronic treatment with morphine, groups of rats were
injected (i.p.) three times (at 8:00, 14:00 and 20:00 h) during 5
consecutive days with increasing doses of the opioid (day 1: 10,
10 and 10 mg/kg; day 2: 10, 20, and 20 mg/kg; day 3: 20, 20 and
40 mg/kg; day 4: 40, 40 and 80 mg/kg; day 5: 80 and 100 mg/
kg) (see boronat et al., 2001), and the animals were killed 2 h
after the last dose of morphine. after this chronic treatment,
naloxone (2 mg/kg, i.p., for 2 h or 6 h)-precipitated withdrawal
or spontaneous (24 h) opiate withdrawal was induced, which
resulted in the standard behavioral reaction (data not shown; see
gabilondo and garcía-sevilla, 1995; miralles et al., 2005).
control rats received chronic 0.9% saline (1 ml/kg) in parallel.

after these treatments, the cerebral frontal cortex and corpus
striatum were dissected on ice, immediately frozen in liquid
nitrogen, and stored at − 80 °c for no longer than 2 weeks until
use.
2.2. sample preparation and immunoblotting
samples of cerebral frontal cortex (100–150 mg) and corpus
striatum (50–70 mg) were homogenized with an ultraturrax
homogenizer (1:15 wt./vol.) in cold 50 mm tris–hcl buffer,
ph 7.5, containing 1 mm edta, 2% sodium  xxxd3215xxx 
(sds), various protease inhibitors (1.3 mm 4-(2-aminoethyl)
benzenesulfonyl fluoride hydrochloride, 10 mug/ml of each
leupeptin, pepstatin a and antipain, and 5 mug/ml of e64), and
two phosphatase inhibitors (1 mm cantharidin and 1 mm

51

sodium orthovanadate). then the samples were sonicated 3× for
5 s. the protein content was determined by the  xxxd2444xxx  reaction
using bicinchoninic acid for the colorimetric detection of
cuprous cation (bca protein assay reagent, pierce chemical
co., rockford, il, usa). aliquots of brain samples were
combined with equal volumes of electrophoresis loading buffer
(50 mm tris–hcl, ph 6.8, 1.5% sds, 10% glycerol, 2.5%  xxxd26xxx  and 0.1% bromophenol blue), boiled (denaturated) and stored at − 80 °c until use.
in routine experiments, 50 mug protein of each brain sample
was subjected to sds–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis
(page) on 15-well (6 × 8-cm minigels, 1 mm thickness) gels
(8%). proteins were electrophoretically transferred (110 v, 3 h,
4 °c) to 0.45 mum nitrocellulose membranes (western blotting)
and blocked at room temperature for 1 h in  xxxd3449xxx  saline
(tbs: 137 mm nacl, 20 mm tris–hcl, ph 7.6) containing 5%
non-fat dry milk and 0.1% tween 20. then the membranes were
incubated overnight at 4 °c in tbs with the primary rabbit
polyclonal antibody (affinity purified) anti-phospho- xxxg1361xxx /2
(raised against a synthetic phospho-ser217/221 mek peptide of
human origin), dilution 1:1000 (cell signalling technology,
beverly, ma, usa). to immunodetect the total content of
 xxxg1361xxx /2, independently of the protein phosphorylation state,
the corresponding phosphorylated blots were stripped (2% sds
and 0.1 m  xxxd26xxx  in 62.5 mm tris–hcl, ph 6.8,
for 30 min at 50 °c), washed with phosphate-buffered saline
(pbs: 137 mm nacl, 2.7 mm kcl, 12 mm na2hpo4, 1.38 mm
kh2po4, ph 7.4), incubated in blocking solution (pbs
containing 5% non-fat dry milk, 0.5% bovine  xxxg124xxx 
and 0.2% tween 20), and then processed as above with the
primary rabbit polyclonal antibody (affinity purified) antimek1/2, dilution 1:5000 (cell signalling technology). the
secondary antibody, horseradish peroxidase-linked anti-rabbit
igg (dilution 1:3000 or 1:5000) (amersham, buckinghamshire,
uk) was incubated in the corresponding blocking solution at
room temperature for 2 h. these anti-mek antibodies labeled
bands with molecular masses of about 45 kda (phosphorylated
 xxxg1361xxx /2 and total  xxxg1361xxx /2), as described previously in the
human brain (ferrer-alcón et al., 2004). bound antibody
(immunoreactivity) was detected using the enhanced chemiluminescence western blot detection system (ecl, amersham)
and visualized by exposure to autoradiographic film (amersham ecl hyperfilm) for 1–10 min (autoradiograms).

with anti-total-protein antibodies.

the autoradiograms ( xxxg1361xxx /2 immunoreactivity) were
scanned in the transmittance mode with a resolution of
600 dpi with an agfa snapscan 600 scanner, and the analysis
of the images were performed with a power macintosh g3
computer using a public domain image program (developed at
the national institutes of health, usa, and available on internet
at http://rsb.info.nih.gov/nih-image/). the amount of  xxxg1361xxx /2
in the cerebral frontal cortex or corpus striatum of rats treated
with opioid drugs and that of control rats, which received saline
or dmso, were compared in the same gel using standard curves
[i.e., total protein loaded versus integrated optical density

theoretical amount of protein loaded in the gel (pt) was obtained
by intrapolation of its iod in the standard curve. the
percentage of target protein immunoreactivity of a given sample
respect to the standard (saline-treated) sample was calculated as
(pt/pr) × 100; where pr is the real amount of protein loaded in
the gel well. this quantification procedure was assessed 4–5
times for each rat brain sample in different gels, and the mean
value of the different gels was used as a final estimate.

3. results
3.1. effects of acute treatments with mu-opioid receptor ligands
on  xxxg1361xxx /2 activity in rat brain
the acute treatments of rats with the potent mu-opioid receptor
agonist sufentanil (1–30 mug/kg, s.c., for 30 min), compared with
saline administration, induced dose-dependent increases (significant with the highest doses) in the immunodensity of
phosphorylated  xxxg1361xxx /2 proteins in the cerebral cortex (30–
95%, fig. 1a) and corpus striatum (113–177%, fig. 1b),
without altering the content of total  xxxg1361xxx /2 in both brain
regions (fig. 1). similarly, a high dose of morphine (100 mg/kg,
i.p., for 2 h) significantly increased the inmunodensity of
phosphorylated  xxxg1361xxx /2 in the cortex (50%) and striatum
(70%) (fig. 2).
sufentanil treatment (15 mug/kg, s.c., for 30–120 min)
resulted in a rapid (30 min) and time-dependent (30–120 min)
phosphorylation of  xxxg1361xxx /2 proteins (65–140%) in the cerebral
cortex (fig. 3a). the observed time–course for sufentanil was
bell-shaped, with a maximal increase in phosphorylated  xxxg1361xxx /
2 detected at 60 min (140%) (fig. 3a). at shorter time points (5,
10 and 15 min), sufentanil (15 mug/kg) did not alter the content of
phosphorylated  xxxg1361xxx /2 in the cortex (data not shown). a
higher dose of sufentanil (30 mug/kg, s.c.) induced similar
increases in phosphorylated  xxxg1361xxx /2 (95 ± 11%, n = 5,
p < 0.001, and 80 ± 27%, n = 5, p < 0.05 at 30 min and 60 min,
respectively) (data not shown).
pretreatment of rats with naloxone (10 mg/kg, i.p.) fully
prevented the acute phosphorylation of  xxxg1361xxx /2 proteins
induced by sufentanil (15 mug/kg, s.c., 30 min) in the cerebral
cortex (fig. 4a), indicating the implication of mu-opioid
receptors in mek activation. naloxone by itself (10 mg/kg, i.
p., for 2 h) had no effect on the immunodensities of
phosphorylated  xxxg1361xxx /2 and total mek in the cortex (fig.
4a). moreover, the acute treatment with a high dose of
naloxone (100 mg/kg, i.p., for 2 h) did not alter significantly the
basal contents of phosphorylated  xxxg1361xxx /2 and total mek in the
cortex (data not shown), suggesting the absence of a tonic
regulation of opioid receptors (mediated by endogenous opioid
peptides) on these enzymes.
3.2. effects of acute treatments with delta- and kappa-opioid receptor
ligands on  xxxg1361xxx /2 activity in rat brain
the acute treatment of rats with the selective delta-opioid
receptor agonist snc-80 (10 mg/kg, i.p.) induced a rapid
(30 min) and significant increase in the phosphorylation of
 xxxg1361xxx /2 (60%), which disappeared by 60–120 min (fig. 3b).
snc-80 did not alter the total content of  xxxg1361xxx /2 in the cortex
(fig. 3b). pretreatment of rats with naltrindole (a selective deltaopioid receptor antagonist, 5 mg/kg, i.p.) fully prevented the
acute activation of phosphorylated  xxxg1361xxx /2 induced by snc80 (fig. 4b), which clearly revealed the involvement of deltaopioid receptors in  xxxg1361xxx /2 activation in the brain.
the acute treatments of rats with the selective kappa-opioid
receptor agonist (−)-u50488h (10 mg/kg, i.p., 30, 60 and

53

120 min) also showed a clear tendency to augment the
phosphorylation of  xxxg1361xxx /2 in the cerebral cortex (fig. 3c)
(anova, f = 3.68, p = 0.016), but the quantitated increases
(20–46%) did not reach statistical significance when compared
with the saline control group (multiple comparison post
test). however, the individual comparisons of the effects of

(two-tailed student's t-test) indicated the induction of a
significant drug effect at 30 min (46 ± 14% increase, n = 4;
t = 2.36, p = 0.046). this selective kappa-opioid receptor agonist did
not modify significantly the total content of  xxxg1361xxx /2 in the
cerebral cortex (fig. 3c).
3.3. effects of chronic morphine treatment and opioid
withdrawal on  xxxg1361xxx /2 activity in rat brain
chronic (5 days) treatment with morphine (10 to 100 mg/kg,
i.p.), compared with saline administration, did not alter
significantly the immunodensity of phosphorylated  xxxg1361xxx /2
or total mek in the cerebral cortex and corpus striatum (2 h
posttreatment) (fig. 5), which suggested the induction of
tachyphylaxis to the repeated and increasing doses of the opioid
drug (see the effects of 100 mg/kg in fig. 2). in morphinedependent rats, however, naloxone (2 mg/kg)-precipitated
withdrawal (2 h and 6 h after the last dose of morphine)
induced rapid and robust increases in the density of phosphorylated  xxxg1361xxx /2, but not in total mek, in the cortex (27% and
49%, respectively) and striatum (83% and 123%, respectively)
(fig. 5). in morphine-dependent rats, the spontaneous opioid
withdrawal (24 h after the chronic treatment) did not modify
significantly the immunodensities of phosphorylated  xxxg1361xxx /2
and total mek in the cortex or striatum (fig. 5).

however, acute treatments with sufentanil and morphine clearly
stimulated the activity of  xxxg1361xxx /2 in the rat cerebral cortex and
the corpus striatum. in fact, the in vitro and in vivo stimulation
of  xxxg1369xxx /2 by morphine and snc-80 have been shown to be
dependent on  xxxg1361xxx /2 activity, mainly because specific mek
inhibitors ( xxxd1169xxx ; sl-327) blocked the opioid-induced
 xxxg1369xxx /2 phosphorylation in sh-sy5y cells (ferrer-alcón et
al., 2004) and the rat brain (garcía-fuster et al., in press). these
findings ruled out the possibility that the activation of  xxxg1369xxx /2
signaling by opioid drugs might be caused by a  xxxg1361xxx /2-

4. discussion
the results demonstrate that acute treatments with mu- and deltaopioid receptor agonists (and to a lesser extent with a selective
kappa-opioid receptor agonist) induced the activation (phosphorylation) of  xxxg1361xxx /2 (map/erk kinases) in the rat brain. thus,
the high efficacy mu-opioid receptor agonist sufentanil (cox et
al., 1998) induced dose- and time-dependent up-regulations of
phosphorylated  xxxg1361xxx /2, through a naloxone-sensitive mechanism, in the cerebral cortex and corpus striatum. a high dose of
morphine, a low efficacy mu-opioid receptor agonist (williams et
al., 2001), also activated  xxxg1361xxx /2 in the cortex and striatum.
similarly, the selective delta-opioid receptor agonist snc-80
increased the content of phosphorylated  xxxg1361xxx /2 in the cortex,
an effect that was blocked by the selective antagonist
naltrindole. in contrast, a high dose of (−)-u50488h (garcíafuster et al., in press), a selective kappa-opioid receptor agonist, did
not consistently induce the activation of  xxxg1361xxx /2 in the cerebral
cortex. these findings indicated that mu- and delta-opioid receptors
have a preponderant role in the acute in vivo regulation of
 xxxg1361xxx /2 in the brain.
although opioid-induced activation of  xxxg1369xxx /2 has been
extensively studied in vitro (fukuda et al., 1996; li and chang,
1996; belcheva et al., 1998; trapaidze et al., 2000; ferreralcón et al., 2004; schulz et al., 2004),  xxxg1361xxx /2 stimulation by
opioid agonists was only described for the delta-opioid receptor
agonist deltorphin in jurkat t lymphocytes (hedin et al., 1999).
recently, fentanyl (a potent mu-opioid receptor agonist) was
shown to induce a naloxone-sensitive activation of  xxxg1369xxx /2,
without altering  xxxg1361xxx /2 activity, in the rat ventral tegmental
area in vitro (lesscher et al., 2003). in the present in vivo study,

cortex and corpus striatum. groups of rats were treated chronically (i.p.) with
saline vehicle (c, n = 7–15) and morphine (chr, 10–100 mg/kg for 5 days; n = 5),
or with chronic morphine followed by naloxone (nlx, 2 mg/kg, i.p.)-precipitated

independent pathway. also recently, it has been reported that i.
c.v. pretreatment of mice with various mek inhibitors
( xxxd1169xxx  or  xxxd3462xxx ) impaired the morphine-induced place
preference paradigm (ozaki et al., 2004), which is also in
support of the current findings.
another interesting finding of this study is that chronic
morphine treatment (5 days) resulted in the induction of
tachyphylaxis to the acute stimulatory effect of this opioid on
the content of phosphorylated  xxxg1361xxx /2 in the cerebral frontal
cortex and the corpus striatum, which most probably reflected
the process of mu-opioid receptor desensitization demonstrated
after repeated agonist exposure (dang and williams, 2004,
2005). in this context, an earlier study (ortiz et al., 1995) also
reported that chronic morphine treatment failed to alter the
levels of mek immunoreactivity in various brain regions of the
rat, but in this investigation mek activity (i.e., enzyme
phosphorylation) was not assessed and only the total content
of mek was measured (negative data in agreement with the
current results). in a recent study (eitan et al., 2003), chronic
morphine treatment in mice (resulting in analgesic tolerance)
also caused tolerance to morphine-induced  xxxg1369xxx /2 activation
in the anterior cingulate cortex and other brain regions, which is
also in line with the current data. however, various in vivo
investigations, dealing with the status of  xxxg1369xxx /2 after chronic
morphine administration (tolerant state), have demonstrated the
induction of decreases in the activity of these enzymes (schulz
and höllt, 1998; ferrer-alcón et al., 2004; muller and
unterwald, 2004), and only one study reported an increased
activity of  xxxg1369xxx /2 in the brain (ortiz et al., 1995). the reasons
for these discrepancies are not readily apparent and they may be
related to the marked different experimental conditions used in
the reported studies (e.g. opiate dose, duration of treatment,
cellular complexity of the brain region, and/or antibodies used).
notably, naloxone-precipitated withdrawal in morphinedependent rats (resulting in an intense behavioral reaction;
gabilondo and garcía-sevilla, 1995) induced a robust
stimulation of  xxxg1361xxx /2 in the cerebral cortex and corpus
striatum, indicating that morphine addiction (dependent state)
is associated with activation of the map/erk kinase
pathway. in fact, naloxone-precipitated withdrawal was
shown to increase  xxxg1369xxx /2 activity in brains of morphinedependent rats (schultz and höllt, 1998). moreover, recent
data from this laboratory also indicate the induction of upregulation in the content of phosphorylated  xxxg1369xxx  (20 ± 6%,
n = 5, p < 0.05) and phosphorylated  xxxg1366xxx  (42 ± 6%, n = 5,
p < 0.01) in a similar group of morphine- (naloxone-)
withdrawn rats (data not shown). together, these results
clearly indicate that the regulation of  xxxg1361xxx /2 and  xxxg1369xxx /2
followed a similar and parallel pattern of activation in the
brain of morphine-dependent rats during the state of opioid
withdrawal (induced by naloxone). this concomitant activation of  xxxg1361xxx /2 and  xxxg1369xxx /2 could be the result, in part, of
an increase in the release of endogenous enkephalins induced
by opioid withdrawal (mas nieto et al., 2002), which would
promote a new stimulus on mek/erk phosphorylation
acting the opioid peptides as mu/delta-opioid receptor agonists.
compared to naloxone-precipitated opioid withdrawal, spon-

55

taneous morphine withdrawal induced a slow and less intense
behavioral reaction (maximal at 24 h; gabilondo and garcíasevilla, 1995) that was not associated with significant
changes in  xxxg1361xxx /2 activation in the cortex and striatum,
which suggests that the increased phosphorylation of  xxxg1361xxx /2
during opioid withdrawal vanished with time and/or with the
intensity of the abstinence syndrome. the current findings
may be relevant in the context of the known role of the mek/
erk signaling pathway in various long-lasting forms of
synaptic plasticity (grewal et al., 1999; adams and sweatt,
2002), including those associated with the chronic adaptive
changes induced by morphine addiction in the brain (nestler,
2002; mazzucchelli et al., 2002).
to sum up, the acute treatment of rats with exogenous opioids
(mainly mu-opioid receptor agonists) increased the phosphorylation of  xxxg1361xxx /2 in the cerebral cortex and corpus striatum, then
mek activity gradually recovered toward normal levels during
the course of repeated morphine administration, and finally
removal of the opioid in these morphine-dependent animals
induced a new and robust increase in the phosphorylation of
 xxxg1361xxx /2 in the brain. these new findings expand our
understanding of the regulation of map kinase/mek/erk
pathway by opioid drugs in the brain.
