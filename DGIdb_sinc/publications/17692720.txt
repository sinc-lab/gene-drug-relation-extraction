abstract
background: varenicline, a selective alpha4beta2 nicotinic
acetylcholine receptor partial agonist, has been developed specifically for smoking cessation. in japan,
39.3% of men smoke and this is a major public health
concern.
objective: the primary objective of this study was
to evaluate the efficacy and dose-response relationship
of varenicline in japanese smokers.
methods: in this double-blind, placebo-controlled,
randomized, parallel-group study, subjects were randomized to receive varenicline at 0.25 mg bid, 0.5 mg
bid, 1 mg bid, or placebo for 12 weeks followed by
a 40-week, nontreatment follow-up phase. the primary efficacy variable was the continuous abstinence
rate (car), defined as no reported smoking (not even
a puff) or other nicotine use and confirmed by endexpiratory carbon monoxide level ≤10 ppm, during
the last 4 weeks of treatment (weeks 9–12). secondary
end points included cars for weeks 9–24 and 9–52.
craving, withdrawal, and smoking satisfaction were
determined by the minnesota nicotine withdrawal
scale, the brief questionnaire on smoking urges, and
the modified cigarette evaluation questionnaire. the
tolerability of varenicline was also evaluated.
results: of 618 subjects who received treatment,
515 (83.3%) were classified as nicotine dependent
(scoring ≥5 on the tobacco dependence screener),
and constituted the primary analysis group. of these,
385 (74.8%) subjects were male, and the mean age
was within the range of 39.0 to 40.2 years. across
1040

treatment groups, subjects claimed to have smoked a
mean of 23.1 to 24.9 cigarettes per day in the preceding 30 days, and the mean score on the fagerström
test for nicotine dependence was within the range
from 5.4 to 5.7. the car for weeks 9–12 was significantly higher for all doses of varenicline compared
with placebo (39.5% [51/129]). the highest car of
65.4% (85/130) was achieved with varenicline 1 mg
bid (odds ratio [or] [95% ci] = 2.98 [1.78–4.99];
p < 0.001). the car for weeks 9–52 was significantly
greater for varenicline 1 mg bid than placebo (34.6%
[45/130] vs 23.3% [30/129]; or [95% ci] = 1.81
[1.04–3.17]; p = 0.036). the cars for weeks 9–
24 at 0.25, 0.5, and 1 mg bid were 33.6% (43/128),
35.2% (45/128), 37.7% (49/130), and for weeks 9–
52 at 0.25 and 0.5 mg bid were 27.3% (35/128) and
28.9% (37/128) but failed to reach significance versus
the placebo (29.5% [38/129] for weeks 9–24 and
23.3% [30/129] for weeks 9–52). treatment-emergent
adverse events (aes) were more prevalent among
varenicline-treated subjects (79.1% [121/153] at 0.25 mg

[125/156] at 1 mg bid) than placebo subjects (71.4%
[110/154]). the 3 most prevalent aes at varenicline
1 mg bid were nasopharyngitis (35.9% [56/156]),
nausea (24.4% [38/156]), and headache (10.3%
[16/156]), all of which were of mild or moderate intensity. nausea was the only ae that appeared dose related (7.2% [11/153] at 0.25 mg bid, 9.7% [15/155]
at 0.5 mg bid, and 24.4% [38/156] at 1 mg bid) versus placebo (7.8% [12/154]).
conclusions: varenicline was associated with dosedependent improvement in smoking abstinence rates
during the last 4 weeks of treatment and in the longer
term over 40 weeks of nontreatment follow-up. the
dose associated with the highest efficacy was varenicline 1 mg bid. (clin ther. 2007;29:1040–1056) copyright © 2007 excerpta medica, inc.

introduction
smoking is a known cause of significant morbidity
and mortality worldwide, with almost 5 million individuals dying prematurely of diseases related to smoking per year worldwide.1 cigarette consumption in
japan is among the highest in the world, amounting to
>2500 cigarettes per person aged >15 years per year.1
although the majority of japanese smokers are men,
with a 39.3% smoking prevalence in 2005, a new and
worrying trend is that smoking rates in women have
been rising.2 smoking prevalence in japanese women
has risen from 9.4% in 1989 to 11.3% in 2005, a rise
largely accounted for by the increase observed among
younger women (in women aged 20–29 and 30–39 years,
smoking prevalence has increased from 8.9% and
11.7%, respectively, in 1989 to 18.9% and 19.4% in
2005).2,3
smoking is a major public health concern in japan,
and tobacco smoking accounted for an estimated
113,000 of 962,000 deaths in japan in 2000.4 annual
health care costs of tobacco-related deaths and diseases in japan are estimated at more than ¥1151.2 billion (us $9.5 billion), with societal costs exceeding
¥3700 billion (us $30.5 billion).5 evidence suggests
that smokers consume excess medical care, especially
inpatient care, and efforts to reduce tobacco exposure
are imperative to improve the health care and economic burden on japanese society.6 although japan is
june 2007

still lagging behind other countries, smoking control
initiatives have recently been introduced that may lead
to an increase in the number of individuals motivated
to stop smoking.
in japan, nicotine-replacement therapies (nrts)
have been approved as aids for smoking cessation,
with nicotine gums being available over the counter,
while  xxxd2721xxx  preparations require a prescription. all other forms of nrt, including nasal
sprays, inhalers, sublingual tablets, and lozenges, are
not approved for use in japan either over the counter
or by prescription. the nrts promote smoking cessation by providing an alternate source of nicotine, allowing smokers to gradually decrease their nicotine
use. a meta-analysis of 105 studies of nrt in a total
of 39,503 subjects concluded that all commercially
available forms of nrt (gum, transdermal patch,
nasal spray, inhaler, and sublingual tablet) are effective, with an odds ratio (or) (95% ci) for abstinence
with nrt compared with either placebo or a nonnrt control group of 1.77 (1.66–1.88).7 the other
primary smoking-cessation therapy is sustained-release
(sr) bupropion. a meta-analysis of 31 studies in a
total of 9940 subjects reported an or (95% ci) for
abstinence with  xxxd385xxx  monotherapy compared with either placebo or nonpharmacotherapeutic
control of 1.94 (1.72–2.19).8 given that bupropion
sr is not licensed in japan, leaving nrt gum and the
transdermal patch as the only pharmacologic aids to
smoking cessation in japan, there is a need for the introduction of new pharmacotherapies with novel
mechanisms of action for smoking cessation.
exposure to nicotine leads to a series of phenomena involving greater expression of nicotine receptors
in the brain, development of tolerance to the physiologic effects of nicotine, dependence on nicotine, and
withdrawal symptoms (eg, urge to smoke, negative affect, restlessness, increased appetite, insomnia) after
smoking cessation.9,10 evidence supports the role of
the alpha4beta2  xxxg456xxx  (nachr) in
the reinforcing effects of nicotine use.11 varenicline, a
selective alpha4beta2 nachr partial agonist developed
specifically for smoking cessation, is hypothesized to
relieve nicotine craving and withdrawal effects while
reducing the reinforcing effects of nicotine through its
partial agonist mechanism of action.12,13
in the united states, a large (n = 1027), randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 52-week study
found significantly improved continuous abstinence

rates (cars) with varenicline 1 mg bid compared
with  xxxd385xxx  150 mg bid and with placebo at
the end of 12 weeks of treatment, and higher cars
were evident for up to 1 year after treatment initiation.14 in this study, the car for the last 4 weeks of
treatment (weeks 9–12) was 43.9% compared with
17.6% in the placebo group (p < 0.001) and 29.8%
in the  xxxd385xxx  group (p < 0.001). furthermore,
52 weeks after quitting, 23.0% of smokers taking varenicline remained abstinent compared with only 10.3% of
placebo-group smokers (p < 0.001) and 14.6% taking
 xxxd385xxx  (p = 0.004). a second, identically designed
study in 1025 subjects had similar results.15
the present study was the first confirmatory trial of
varenicline to be conducted in japan. it was designed
to evaluate the dose-response relationship of varenicline, over 3 doses, versus placebo for smoking cessation in japanese smokers.

subjects and methods
study design
a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled,
parallel-group, japanese multicenter (19 sites) study
(clinicaltrials.gov identifier: nct00139750) was
conducted with the primary objective of comparing the
efficacy of varenicline at doses of 0.25 mg bid, 0.5 mg
bid, and 1 mg bid with placebo after 12 weeks of
treatment. secondary objectives included long-term efficacy of varenicline up to 40 weeks after the end of
treatment. the safety profile and tolerability of varenicline were also evaluated.
this study was conducted in accordance with the
declaration of helsinki16 and was approved by the institutional review board at each of the 19 study sites
and was conducted in compliance with international
conference on harmonisation and good clinical
practice guidelines.17

participants
japanese smokers aged between 20 and 75 years
who were motivated to stop smoking and who had
claimed to have smoked a mean of at least 10 cigarettes per day during the preceding year without a period of abstinence >90 days were eligible for the study.
women of childbearing potential were eligible if they
were not pregnant or breastfeeding, and if they practiced effective contraception for at least 30 days prior
to screening. smokers with a history of serious diseases or diseases that required close follow-up (includ1042

ing cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, and pulmonary
disease; cancer; significant hepatic or renal impairment; neurologic and psychiatric disorder) and those
with significant laboratory abnormalities were not eligible for participation. other exclusion criteria included a body mass index of <15 kg/m2 or >38 kg/m2,
body weight <45 kg, history of drug (except nicotine)
or alcohol abuse or dependence within the previous
12 months, and use of nrt within the previous 30 days.
study subjects who used tobacco products other than
cigarettes (pipe tobacco, snuff, chewing tobacco, cigars) within 30 days prior to screening or who did not
agree to abstain from use of these products during the
study period were also excluded.

interventions
a screening visit was conducted 5 to 21 days prior
to the baseline visit and subjects were enrolled into the
study based on inclusion and exclusion criteria. during the screening visit, written informed consent was
obtained, and the target quit date (tqd), the day
on which the subject agreed to initiate smoking abstinence, was set to coincide with the first scheduled
on-treatment visit. the tobacco dependence screener
(tds),18 a scale from 0–10 used in the smokingcessation treatment service reimbursed by public health
insurance in japan, was used to diagnose nicotine dependence (score ≥5), and the degree of nicotine dependence was determined by the fagerström test for nicotine
dependence (ftnd, scale from 0–10, with higher scores
indicating greater dependence).19 a medical history,
smoking history, physical examination (including blood
pressure, heart rate, and body weight), and 12-lead electrocardiogram (ecg) were also conducted.
at the baseline visit, a computer-generated list of
random numbers was used to assign subjects to receive
12 weeks of treatment with varenicline 0.25 mg bid,
0.5 mg bid, or 1 mg bid or placebo. all treatments
were provided as tablets to be taken with 200 ml
water. treatment began on the evening of the baseline
visit, and dose titration to full dose was implemented
during week 1 (0.25 mg qd for 7 days in the 0.25 mg
bid group, 0.5 mg qd for 7 days in the 0.5 mg bid
group, and 0.5 mg qd for 3 days followed by 0.5 mg
bid for 4 days in the 1 mg bid group), since earlier
clinical study results suggested improved tolerability
with initial dose titration.20 double-blinding of subjects and investigators was maintained throughout the
study using matching placebo tablets, including the

dose titration during week 1. adherence to treatment
was checked by counting leftover tablets or by interviews with subjects at weekly clinic visits during the
treatment period.
subjects were given brief smoking-cessation counseling based on the us agency for health care policy
and research guidelines,21 lasting up to 10 minutes at
each clinic visit, beginning at baseline and continuing
until the end of treatment. an educational booklet on
smoking cessation22 was distributed to subjects for
review at baseline. the week-1 visit was scheduled to
coincide with the tqd and set as the date that subjects
were to initiate abstinence from smoking. smokingcessation counseling (of up to 5 minutes) was also provided by telephone contact at tqd + 3 days.
the nontreatment follow-up period was 40 weeks,
with 6 clinic visits (weeks 13, 16, 24, 36, 44, and
52) and 5 telephone contacts (weeks 20, 28, 32, 40,
and 48). smoking-cessation counseling was also
provided during this period, lasting up to 10 minutes at clinic visits and up to 5 minutes by telephone
contacts.

efficacy evaluations
the primary end point was the end-expiratory carbon monoxide (co)–confirmed 4-week car for
weeks 9–12, with no reported smoking (not even a
puff) or other nicotine use. smoking status was obtained, beginning at the week-1 visit, through selfreports of cigarette and other nicotine use since the last
study visit and confirmed by measurement of endexpiratory co concentration. of the various biochemical markers used to confirm abstinence, such as nicotine, cotinine, co, and thiocyanate, end-expiratory
co concentration was used because it is considered an
appropriate measure for biochemical verification23,24
and is widely used in controlled clinical trials.25,26
although end-expiratory co cannot be used to detect the use of noncombustible sources of nicotine (eg,
nicotine gum), all forms of tobacco and nrt were
prohibited in this trial, as stated in the informed consent form signed by all subjects, and subjects were
asked about usage at each clinic visit and telephone
contact. end-expiratory co levels were measured
using a micro smokerlyzer (bedfont scientific limited,
rochester, united kingdom) following the subjects’
self-reported smoking status at each clinic visit from
baseline to week 52 or early termination of treatment/
follow-up. a subject was determined to be a nonjune 2007

smoker if the end-expiratory co concentration was
≤10 ppm. if co levels were found to be >10 ppm, the
subject was considered nonabstinent for the period associated with that measurement. the car was defined as the proportion of subjects confirmed to have
achieved abstinence during the period. subjects who
discontinued the study were considered smokers for
the remainder of the study.
the end expiratory co–confirmed cars for
weeks 9–24 and weeks 9–52 were also evaluated as
secondary end points. end-expiratory co–confirmed
7-day point prevalence (pp) of abstinence, defined as
the proportion of subjects confirmed to have achieved
abstinence during the past 7 days, was evaluated at
week 2 through week 12, week 24, and week 52 to facilitate comparison with existing literature.27

other evaluations
three instruments were used to assess craving,
withdrawal, and the reinforcing effects of smoking,
beginning at the baseline visit—the minnesota
nicotine withdrawal scale (mnws),28–30 the brief
questionnaire on smoking urges (qsu-brief),30–32
and the modified cigarette evaluation questionnaire
(mceq).30,33,34 nicotine-withdrawal symptoms were
assessed with the mnws scale. this scale comprised
9 items, categorized into 5 subscales (urge to smoke,
negative affect, restlessness, increased appetite, and
insomnia), in which withdrawal symptoms were rated
on a scale of 0 (not at all) to 4 (extreme). assessment
occurred at each clinic visit from baseline to week 7,
week 12, and week 13. the qsu-brief assessed the
urge to smoke (craving), using a 10-item scale rated
from 1 (strongly disagree) to 7 (strongly agree), based
on the total score as well as on 2 subscales, factor 1
(5 items concerning the urge to smoke) and factor 2
(3 items concerning relief from negative affect). it was
completed at each clinic visit from baseline to week 7
and again at the week-12 visit. the mceq was used
to assess the reinforcing effects of smoking. it was categorized into 5 subscales (smoking satisfaction, psychological reward, enjoyment of respiratory tract
sensations, craving reduction, and aversion) in
which higher scores indicated stronger intensity of
symptoms related to smoking effects on a 7-point
scale (from 1 = not at all to 7 = extremely). it was administered weekly from baseline to week 7 and was
completed only by those subjects who had claimed to
have smoked since the previous assessment.

tolerability assessments
tolerability assessments included physical examinations, blood pressure, heart rate, body weight,
ecg, laboratory tests, adverse events (aes), and serious aes (saes). an sae was defined as any untoward
medical occurrence at any dose that resulted in death;
was life-threatening; required inpatient hospitalization
or prolongation of existing hospitalization; resulted in
persistent or significant disability or incapacity; or resulted in a congenital anomaly or birth defect.
blood pressure, heart rate, and body weight were
measured at each clinic visit from baseline to week 52
or early termination of treatment/follow-up. blood pressure and heart rate were measured in the upper portion
of the dominant arm with the patient in the sitting position after an appropriate period of rest. ecgs were
carried out at screening, baseline, week 2, and week 12,
or early termination of treatment. laboratory tests to
determine clinical abnormalities included blood chemistry, complete blood count, and urinalysis. all observed or self-reported aes during the treatment period
and up to 7 days after the final dose were recorded in
case-report forms and followed up until they resolved
or to the study end.

randomization/statistical methods
before randomization, subjects were stratified into
2 groups based on their diagnosis of nicotine dependence as determined by the tds score at screening,
as follows: those with tds scores ≥5 (the nicotinedependent group) and those with tds scores ≤4.
subjects in each group were randomized to 1 of the
4 treatment groups in a 1:1:1:1 ratio using a central
procedure. the primary efficacy analyses of the primary and secondary end points (car at weeks 9–12,
9–24, and 9–52, and 7-day pp) were conducted in the
nicotine-dependent group (all subjects who received
≥1 dose of study medication and had a tds score ≥5);
the primary tolerability analyses were conducted in
the total group (all subjects who received ≥1 dose of
study medication, regardless of tds score). efficacy
analyses were also conducted in the total group, and
tolerability analyses were also conducted in the nicotinedependent group.
to detect differences at a significance level of 0.05
between varenicline 0.5 mg or 1 mg bid and placebo
in the primary analysis population with at least 90%
power (based on the results of an earlier varenicline
dose-response study20), it was estimated that a mini1044

mum sample size of at least 480 nicotine-dependent
smokers was required. operationally, enrollment of
smokers scoring ≤4 on the tds was planned to be
ended when the number of these subjects reached 200.
therefore, the maximum planned sample size was
680 subjects.
the primary end point (car for weeks 9–12) was
compared between each varenicline group and the
placebo group using a logistic regression model that
included dose and study center as categorical variables. to preserve the family-wise error rate, a stepdown procedure (1 mg bid > 0.5 mg bid > 0.25 mg
bid vs placebo) was used for pairwise comparisons
between the varenicline and placebo groups for the
primary end point.35 each test was carried out using a
2-sided type i error rate of 5%.
a logistic regression model was also used to investigate a dose-response relationship over the 3 varenicline doses (secondary analysis). no adjustment for
multiple comparisons was made for any of the secondary analyses. similarly, a logistic regression model that
included dose and study center as categorical variables
was used to evaluate comparisons between the 3 doses
of varenicline and placebo for the secondary end
points (car for weeks 9–24 and weeks 9–52, and
7-day pp). repeated-measures analysis was used to
evaluate mean scores on the mnws, qsu-brief, and
mceq. summary statistics (responder rates for binary variables; mean and standard error for continuous
variables) were calculated for each treatment group
for each evaluation period.

results
subject disposition and baseline characteristics
a total of 619 subjects were enrolled and randomly assigned to receive varenicline 0.25 mg bid (153 subjects), 0.5 mg bid (156), 1 mg bid (156), or placebo
(154). a total of 618 subjects received treatment;
1 subject originally assigned to the varenicline 0.5 mg
group withdrew prior to treatment. of the total
group, 577 (93.4%) subjects completed the treatment
and 510 (82.5%) completed the study (figure 1). the
1 subject who did not receive study treatment was not
included in these analyses. as this subject withdrew
prior to treatment for reasons unrelated to the study
and the decision to initiate treatment could not be
influenced by knowledge of the assigned treatment,
the intent-to-treat principle was preserved despite this
exclusion.

4-week car for weeks 9–12 was analyzed using a logistic regression model, the slope of the regression line
was 0.98 (95% ci, 0.50–1.48), confirming a significant dose-response relationship (p < 0.001).
the cars for weeks 9–24 in the nicotine-dependent
group (table ii, figure 3) were not significant for any

7-day point prevalence of abstinence
the 7-day pp for the nicotine-dependent group
increased from week 3 and thereafter in all of the
varenicline groups compared with the placebo group,
and was the highest in the varenicline 1 mg bid group
june 2007

at all time points (figure 4). at the end of treatment
(week 12), more participants were abstinent in each of
the varenicline groups (0.25 mg bid, 64.1% [82/128]
[or, 2.17; p = 0.003]; 0.5 mg bid, 62.5% [80/128]
[or, 2.02; p = 0.006]; and 1 mg bid, 72.3% [94/130]
[or, 3.21; p < 0.001]) compared with the placebo
group (45.7% [59/129]). at study end (week 52),
7-day pp remained higher in 2 of the 3 varenicline
groups (0.25 mg bid, 39.1% [50/128] [or, 1.71;
p < 0.05]; 1 mg bid, 42.3% [55/130] [or, 1.97; p =

measures of craving, withdrawal, and
smoking reinforcement
the effects of varenicline compared with placebo
on craving, withdrawal, and smoking satisfaction, as
determined by the mnws, qsu-brief, and mceq
questionnaires, are shown in tables iii and iv for the
nicotine-dependent group.
over weeks 1 through 7 (table iii), mean scores on
the mnws urge to smoke subscale were significantly lower with varenicline 0.25, 0.5, and 1 mg bid

restlessness (p = 0.018, p < 0.001, and p < 0.001). no
significant differences in mean scores on the mnws
subscales of increased appetite and insomnia were
observed between the varenicline and placebo groups.
the descriptive statistics of the mnws subscale
scores at week 13 were similar to week 12, suggesting
no withdrawal effects following discontinuation of
treatment.
results for the mean qsu-brief scores over weeks 1
through 7 (table iii) suggested a similar effect of
varenicline on the qsu-brief total craving score to
that observed by the mnws. mean scores in the
june 2007

varenicline 0.25, 0.5, and 1 mg bid groups were all
significantly lower than that in the placebo group
(p = 0.012, p < 0.001, and p < 0.001, respectively).
similarly, analysis of qsu-brief–factor 1 (urge to
smoke) and –factor 2 (relief from negative affect) subcomponents indicated that all mean scores in the
varenicline 0.25, 0.5, and 1 mg bid groups were significantly lower than those in the placebo group
(factor 1: p = 0.006, p < 0.001, and p < 0.001; factor
2: p = 0.019, p < 0.001, and p < 0.001).
finally, analysis of the mean mceq scores over
weeks 1 through 7 (table iv) found that varenicline
was associated with significantly reduced scores on
the subscale of smoking satisfaction at 0.5 and 1 mg
bid compared with placebo (both doses, p < 0.001),

tolerability
the percentage of subjects in the total group who
experienced all-causality, treatment-emergent aes was
higher in the varenicline groups (0.25 mg bid, 79.1%
[121/153]; 0.5 mg bid, 80.6% [125/155]; and 1 mg
bid, 80.1% [125/156]) than in the placebo group
(71.4% [110/154]) (table v). the aes that occurred
in ≥5% of subjects in any treatment group are reported in table vi. the 3 most prevalent aes at varenicline 1 mg bid were nasopharyngitis (35.9% [56 /
156]), nausea (24.4% [38/156]), and headache
(10.3% [16/156]). the incidence of nausea in the varenicline groups was dose dependent: 7.2% (11/153) at
0.25 mg bid, 9.7% (15/155) at 0.5 mg bid, and
24.4% (38/156) at 1 mg bid. most aes were of mild
or moderate intensity; only 2 aes were reported as severe (cholecystitis in 1 subject in the varenicline 0.25 mg
bid group, subarachnoid hemorrhage in 1 subject in
the placebo group).
saes developed in 5 (3.3%) of 153 subjects in the
varenicline 0.25 mg bid group, 2 (1.3%) of 155 subjects in the 0.5 mg bid group, 3 (1.9%) of 156 subjects
in the 1 mg bid group, and 3 (1.9%) of 154 subjects
in the placebo group. two of the saes were considered
treatment related: 1 case of cholecystitis in the vareni-

cline 0.25 mg bid group, which resolved after laparoscopic cholecystectomy, and 1 case of angina pectoris
in the 1 mg bid group, which resolved after discontinuation of treatment. one death occurred due to a traffic accident during the nontreatment follow-up period
in a subject in the varenicline 1 mg bid group.
aes that led to study discontinuation occurred in 3

group (1 subject with nausea; 1 with peritonitis and

nasopharyngitis, and headache), 5 (3.2%) of 156 subjects in the 1 mg bid group (1 subject feeling abnormal; 1 with nausea; 1 with angina pectoris; 1 with
ovarian hematoma; and 1 with nausea and asthenia),
and 3 (1.9%) of 154 subjects in the placebo group
(1 subject with subarachnoid hemorrhage; 1 with contusion; and 1 with rash), all of which resolved after termination of treatment (table v). across all treatment
groups, the proportion of subjects who had a temporary suspension of treatment due to aes ranged from
9.7% (15/154) to 13.5% (21/155) (table v), although
these subjects returned to full dosing and continued
in the trial. the ae profile in the nicotine-dependent
group was similar to that in the total group.
in 4 subjects in the total group, a total of 5 laboratory test abnormalities were reported as treatmentrelated aes. in the varenicline 1 mg bid group, 1 subject had both elevated aspartate aminotransferase

discussion
the current study suggests that varenicline, an alpha4beta2
nachr partial agonist, has significant efficacy for
smoking cessation in japanese smokers defined as
nicotine dependent by scoring ≥5 on the tds. results
for the primary end point, the cars for weeks 9–12,
were significantly higher for all doses of varenicline
over placebo at the end of treatment. efficacy was
evident in a dose-dependent manner, with the highest
june 2007

abstinence rate observed in the varenicline 1 mg bid
group for both primary and secondary efficacy measures.
in the varenicline 1 mg bid group, 65.4% of subjects
achieved continuous abstinence during the last 4 weeks
of treatment compared with 39.5% in the placebo
group (or, 2.98), and 34.6% of subjects who received varenicline 1 mg bid remained continuously
abstinent from week 9 through week 52 compared
with 23.3% of placebo subjects (or, 1.81). cars at
end of treatment and week-52 follow-up were similar
when the total group, including smokers with tds
scores of ≤4, was considered. results for the less conservative measure of smoking cessation, the 7-day pp,
supported these continuous abstinence measures.
the unique activity of varenicline was reinforced
by additional measures. based on the mean scores on
the mnws urge to smoke subscale and the qsubrief, all doses of varenicline were associated with a
reduced urge to smoke compared with placebo. mean
scores on the negative affect and restlessness mnws
subscales were also significantly lower with varenicline treatment compared with placebo, suggesting a
reduction in withdrawal symptoms. results of the
mceq subscales support the idea that varenicline reduces smoking satisfaction. this characteristic of
varenicline treatment may help to decrease the reinforcing effects of nicotine. similar effects were observed in the us studies.14,15
overall, varenicline was well tolerated. in the total
group, the incidences of aes were higher in the

varenicline groups (79.1%–80.6%) than in the placebo group (71.4%), and most were considered mild or
moderate in intensity, with 12 (2.6%) subjects treated
with varenicline discontinuing the study. the incidence of nausea in the 1 mg bid dosing group was
lower (24.4%) than that reported in the us studies
(29.4% and 28.1%),14,15 which suggests a favorable
tolerability profile of varenicline in japanese smokers
for the dosing regimens used in this 12-week study.
a limitation of the study design was that inclusion/
exclusion criteria limited the study population to relatively healthy subjects, excluding smokers with unstable diseases and psychiatric disorders. consequently,
extrapolation of these results to the general population requires some caution.
the cars for weeks 9–12 and weeks 9–52 observed in the present study at the varenicline 1 mg bid
dose were higher than those reported in the 2 us studies of varenicline.14,15 however, this was also true for
the placebo group in this study compared with the
us studies, and the treatment effect for varenicline defined by the absolute differences in cars between
varenicline 1 mg bid and placebo were similar for all
studies (present study car difference for weeks 9–12,
25.9% vs 26.3%14 and 26.3%15 in the us studies;
present study car difference for weeks 9–52, 11.3%
vs 12.7%14 and 13.5%15 in the us studies). the efficacy of varenicline in both this present study and the
2 us studies are reflected in the ors for quitting on
varenicline 1 mg bid compared with placebo. in this
study, the or for weeks 9–12 was 2.98, and for the 2
us studies the ors were 3.8514 and 3.85.15 similarly,
for weeks 9–52 the or was 1.81 in this study, and in
the us studies the ors were 2.6614 and 3.09.15
cars may have been influenced by differences in
smoking-cessation environments in japan and the
united states. there is a longer history of promotional strategies to encourage smoking cessation in the
united states than in japan. consequently, the majority of smokers in us studies had previously experienced failed quit attempts, with ~15% of subjects
making their first quit attempt.15 in contrast, in the
current japanese study, ~35% of subjects were making their first serious attempt to quit. successful tobacco control is thought to result in a higher dependence
among the remaining smokers due to selective quitting
by smokers with lower dependence.36 however, the
mean number of cigarettes smoked per day and ftnd
between the us and the japanese studies were compa1054

rable. thus, differences in smoking-cessation environments may have had minimal influence on the difference in the reported cars.
another consideration is better treatment compliance and the high enthusiasm in both the investigators
and the study participants in an environment with
limited pharmacotherapies available for smoking cessation compared with the united states. this could
explain the greater study retention rate in both the
treatment phase of the present study (93.3% for
varenicline and 94.6% for placebo in the nicotinedependent group) compared with the us studies
(75.8%14 and 74.2%15 for varenicline; 65.3%14 and
62.5%15 for placebo), as well as the nontreatment
phase (80.6% for varenicline and 89.1% for placebo
in the nicotine-dependent group) in this study compared with the us studies (70.0%14 and 61.0%15 for
varenicline; 60.0%14 and 54.3%15 for placebo). a
higher retention rate suggests that more subjects received treatment and counseling during the nontreatment follow-up phase, allowing an accurate evaluation of the abstinence rate in a study design in which
all subjects who discontinued treatment and followup were assumed to be smokers.

conclusions
the results of this study suggest that varenicline, the
first in a new class of compounds developed for smoking cessation, was an efficacious and well-tolerated
therapy in nicotine-dependent smokers within this
japanese study population. in a dose-dependent manner, treatment with varenicline for 12 weeks was associated with improved smoking-abstinence rates measured during the last 4 weeks of treatment as well as
long-term abstinence in the 40-week follow-up period. varenicline was generally well tolerated, with mild
or moderate nausea as the main dose-dependent ae.
