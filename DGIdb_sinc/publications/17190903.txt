pharmacological dissection and distribution of nan/ xxxg2019xxx , t-type
ca2+ currents, and mechanically activated cation currents in different
populations of drg neurons
bertrand coste, marcel crest, and patrick delmas

low voltage–activated (lva) t-type ca2+ (icat) and nan/ xxxg2019xxx  currents regulate drg neurons by setting the
threshold for the action potential. although alterations in these channels have been implicated in a variety of
pathological pain states, their roles in processing sensory information remain poorly understood. here, we carried
out a detailed characterization of lva currents in drg neurons by using a method for better separation of nan/
 xxxg2019xxx  and icat currents. nan/ xxxg2019xxx  was inhibited by inorganic ica blockers as follows (ic50, mum): la3+ (46) >
cd2+ (233) > ni2+ (892) and by  xxxd2638xxx , a non-dihydropyridine icat antagonist. amiloride, however, a preferential  xxxg308xxx  channel blocker, had no effects on nan/ xxxg2019xxx  current. using these discriminative tools, we showed
that nan/ xxxg2019xxx ,  xxxg308xxx , and amiloride- and ni2+-resistant icat (ar-icat) contribute differentially to lva currents in distinct sensory cell populations. nan/ xxxg2019xxx  carried lva currents into type-i (ci) and type-ii (cii) small
nociceptors and medium-adelta–like nociceptive cells but not in low-threshold mechanoreceptors, including putative
down-hair (d-hair) and aalpha/beta cells.  xxxg308xxx  predominated in cii-nociceptors and in putative d-hair cells. ar-icat
was restricted to cii-nociceptors, putative d-hair cells, and aalpha/beta-like cells. these cell types distinguished by their
current-signature displayed different types of mechanosensitive channels. ci- and cii-nociceptors displayed
amiloride-sensitive high-threshold mechanical currents with slow or no adaptation, respectively. putative d-hair
and aalpha/beta-like cells had low-threshold mechanical currents, which were distinguished by their adapting kinetics
and sensitivity to amiloride. thus, subspecialized drg cells express specific combinations of lva and mechanosensitive channels, which are likely to play a key role in shaping responses of drg neurons transmitting different
sensory modalities.
introduction

dorsal root ganglia (drg) neurons form a heterogeneous population based on criteria such as cell body
size, structures innervated, and sensory modalities.
during the last 20 years, compelling evidence has accumulated that suggests that these physiologically and
anatomically distinct populations of drg neurons also
express different subsets of ion channels (waxman
et al., 1999; wood et al., 2004; wang and woolf, 2005).
based on their differential sensitivity to tetrodotoxin
(ttx), na+ channels are typically classified into ttxsensitive and ttx-resistant subunits. small- to mediumsized drg neurons express ttx-resistant na+ currents
produced by  xxxg2018xxx  and  xxxg2019xxx  channel isoforms
(akopian et al., 1996; sangameswaran et al., 1996;
dib-hajj et al., 1998; tate et al., 1998; benn et al., 2001;
fang et al., 2002).  xxxg2018xxx  encodes a slowly activating and
inactivating current (also known as sns or  xxxg2018xxx ), which
has a relatively depolarized threshold for activation and
may support action potential propagation in c- and adeltanociceptive fibers (akopian et al., 1996; sangameswaran
et al., 1996; blair and bean, 2002). in contrast, the  xxxg2019xxx 
subunit (also known as nan or  xxxg2019xxx ) generates a low

voltage–activated (lva) channel current with very
slow activation and inactivation rates and larger single
channel conductance (herzog et al., 2001; coste et al.,
2004).  xxxg2019xxx  channels give rise to a “persistent” na+
current at subthreshold voltages that lowers action
potential threshold and promotes burst discharges
(herzog et al., 2001; baker et al., 2003; coste et al.,
2004). mice with nonfunctional  xxxg2019xxx  channels do not
develop the persistent heat hyperalgesia that is normally
seen in inflammatory pain models (priest et al., 2005).
in addition to  xxxg2019xxx  channels, drg neurons also
express lva t-type ca2+ currents (icat) (carbone and
lux, 1984; bossu et al., 1985; nowycky et al., 1985;
scroggs and fox, 1992; shin et al., 2003). these channels are activated by weak depolarizations near resting
potential and act as efficient tuners of cell excitability
(huguenard, 1996). the pivotal role of icat in nociception has been inferred previously (dogrul et al., 2003)
and recently confirmed by antisense knocking-down
strategies (bourinet et al., 2005).

drg cell cultures
young rats (male wistars, 120–130 g) were anesthetized with halothane and killed by severing of the carotid arteries in accordance
with the guide for the care and use of laboratory animals. cultures of drg neurons were established from thoraco-lumbar
drgs excised and freed from their connective tissue sheaths.
they were incubated in enzyme solution containing 2 mg/ml of
collagenase ia (gibco brl) for 45 min at 37°c and triturated in
hanks’ medium (gibco brl). the resulting suspension was
plated in nunclon dishes. culture medium was dulbecco’s modified eagle’s medium (dmem) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fcs, 100 u/ml penicillin-streptomycin, 2 mm l-glutamine,
25 ng/ml  xxxg1564xxx  (ngf), and 2 ng/ml glial-derived
 xxxg1614xxx  (gdnf) (all from gibco brl). neurons
were recorded within 4–12 h after plating. care and use of rats
were in accordance with institutional guidelines.
whole-cell patch-clamp recording
patch pipettes had resistance of 2–3 momega when filled with an internal solution consisting of (in mm) 100 cscl, 30 csf, 10 hepes, 10
egta, 8 nacl, 1 cacl2, 1 mgcl2, 4 mgatp, and 0.4 na2gtp (ph
adjusted to 7.3, 304 mosm). in some recordings of large drg
neurons, csf was substituted by cscl. the use of internal fluoride
facilitates inhibition of high voltage–activated (hva) ca2+ currents (kostyuk et al., 1975; akaike et al., 1989; herrington and
lingle, 1992; todorovic and lingle, 1998) and helps to reveal
nan/ xxxg2019xxx  currents (coste et al., 2004; maruyama et al., 2004).
thus, for all experiments, once the whole-cell configuration had
been attained, currents were allowed to stabilize for 5 min before beginning recordings. cells for which currents continued to
fluctuate after this time were not recorded further.
the extracellular solution consisted of (in mm) 60 nacl, 110
sucrose, 3 kcl, 1 mgcl2, 10 hepes, 2.5 cacl2, 10 glucose, 10
tea-cl, 0.0005 ttx (ph 7.3, 296 mosm). the “low sodium” external solution was achieved by isoosmotically substituting nacl

by sucrose but still contained 2 mm na+. this was done to prevent changes in intracellular [ca2+] that might result from the
reversing of the  xxxg2161xxx . whole-cell currents were
measured with an axopatch 200b amplifier (axon instruments
inc.), filtered at 1–2 khz (four-pole bessel filter), and sampled
at a rate five times the filter frequency. otherwise noticed, currents were leak subtracted using a p/6 protocol as previously
described (delmas et al., 2000; coste et al., 2004). voltage errors
were minimized using 70–85% series resistance compensation.
the access resistance ranged between 4 and 7 momega. cell capacitance was estimated from the time constant of the decay phase of
a current transient elicited by a 10-mv hyperpolarizing step from
a holding potential of −100 mv. all experiments were done at
room temperature.
mechanical stimulation
after electrophysiological characterization of drg neurons in
whole-cell recording mode, the cell was subjected to incremental
mechanical stimulation. mechanical stimulation was achieved using a fire-polished glass pipette (tip diameter 3–4 mum) positioned
at an angle of 60° to the cell being recorded. downward movement of the probe toward the cell was driven by a pclampcontrolled piezo-electric crystal microstage (step driver pz-100;
burleigh). the probe was typically positioned 2 mum from the cell
body. this distance probe-cell was then subtracted from the total
distance travelled by the probe, thereby defining the actual stimulus intensity. the probe had a velocity of 200 mum/s during the
ramp segment of the command for forward motion and the stimulus was applied for 100–200 ms. to assess the mechanical sensitivity of a cell, a series of mechanical steps in 1–2-mum increments
were applied every 15 s, which allowed full recovery of most mechanosensitive currents.
cell classiﬁcation
our approach to neuronal identification of rat drg neurons
draws on previous studies (cardenas et al., 1995; djouhri et al.,
1998; petruska et al., 2000; petruska et al., 2002). although the association between drg cell classes in vitro and in vivo remains
speculative, our classification scheme was based on the notion
that functionally uniform cell populations can be identified by
their repertoire of ion channels. cells were classified according to
five cluster variables, namely, peak amplitude (normalized for cell
size, pa/pf) of nan/ xxxg2019xxx , sns/ xxxg2018xxx , amiloride-sensitive
and amiloride-resistant icat, and cell capacitance (pf). for clustering, we used a nonhierarchical method based on a k-means
algorithm (anderberg, 1973) and a euclidean distance measure
was used to calculate how close each cell is to the target group.
the analysis was repeated for a number of clusters varying from
1 to 15, and the optimal number of clusters was determined using
the cubic clustering criterion statistics. based on these cluster
variables, five groups of cells could be classified into distinct, but
internally homogeneous, subpopulations. to determine whether
these groups had predictive validity, we examined whether each
cell cluster was homogeneous with respect to sensory modalities,
including properties of mechanosensitive currents and responsiveness to capsaicin. to obtain the entire battery of characteristics, we recorded cells for 60–90 min. note that the presence of
other, mostly heterogeneous, groups of drg cells ( 15% of the
total sampling) suggests the existence of additional types of neurons that occur less frequently. because of the paucity of data on
these cells, they were not included in this study.
the drg cells from which we recorded had properties consistent with nociceptors, down-hair (d-hair) cells, and aalpha/beta cells.
cells classified as nociceptors have small (c-type, 14–40 pf) or
medium (adelta-type, 35–70 pf) diameters, are sensitive to capsaicin,
and/or express  xxxg2019xxx /nan current (fang et al., 2002; 2006).
d-hair cells have medium size (39–65 pf) and very distinctive

given that the expression of lva currents has a
unique impact on neuronal excitability, it is of great interest to know which drg cell subpopulations express a
combination of nan/ xxxg2019xxx  and icat channels. using
pharmacological discriminating tools, we have broken
down lva currents and provided a thorough description of the specific contribution of nan/ xxxg2019xxx  and
icat complements in over 350 drg neurons. to better
characterize drg cell subpopulations, we combined
this approach with the measurement of cell size, capsaicin sensitivity, and characterization of mechanically
activated cation currents. reliance on identification of
drg cell populations from the presence of these different channels has the potential to provide criteria by
which nociceptive and nonnociceptive subpopulations
might be distinguished. based on these current signatures, drg cells were classified into five main, internally
uniform subgroups, each expressing a unique combination of lva and sensory channels. our study therefore
provides a characteristic fingerprint of lva-channels’
activity in drg nociceptors and mechanoreceptors,
which may aid in the understanding of their physiological function.

examined. statistical comparisons were analyzed using student’s
t test or anova. p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.

drug application and chemicals
extracellular media were exchanged using a gravity-fed bath perfusion system at a flow rate of 10 ml/min, while bath solution was
removed by continuous suction. the volume of fluid in the recording chamber was 1 ml, allowing the exchange of bathing solution within 6–8 s. recycling was used to reduce the amount of
ttx used. block of currents, irrespective of the channel types examined, was estimated as inhibition of peak currents during 100-ms
test pulses from a holding potential of −100 mv at a frequency
of 0.2–0.33 hz. for concentration–response studies, increasing
concentrations of blockers were applied sequentially while stimulation of the cell was continued at 0.2–0.33 hz until the response
for a given concentration reached a plateau. this procedure was
performed 5–8 min from rupturing the patch before any rundown of nan/ xxxg2019xxx  current could occur. sns/ xxxg2018xxx  and icat
were not susceptible to substantial rundown.
all chemicals were obtained from sigma-aldrich, except ttx
(alomone labs). stock solutions of ttx (0.1 mm),  xxxd2638xxx 
(5 mm), ni2+, la3+, and cd2+ (100 mm) were prepared in water.
a stock solution of 1 m amiloride was made by dissolving amiloride
hydrochloride in dmso. the maximum concentration of dmso
in the superfusate for these experiments was 0.3%, which was determined to have no effects on drg currents in control experiments. a stock solution of 50 mm capsaicin was prepared in 100%
ethanol. the maximum concentration of ethanol in the superfusate was 0.002%, which had no apparent effects on current
properties. our attempt to reduce external ca2+ ion concentrations to 0–10 mum (while increasing mg2+ to 5–8 mm) in order
to suppress ca2+ currents led to seal instability and made drg
cells unhealthy (see also rush et al., 1998). this made routine experiments with nominally ca2+-free solutions virtually impossible, especially because more than 1–2 h recording was typically required
in order to characterize electrophysiologically and pharmacologically the cells under investigation.

the whole-cell patch-clamp recording method section.

heterogeneity of lva currents in drg neurons
as revealed by variable sensitivities to cadmium

low voltage–activated (lva) inward currents were studied from 367 cells of acutely dissociated rat drgs, using
physiological ca2+ concentrations ([ca2+]o = 2.5 mm)
and reduced driving force for na+ ([na+]o = 60 mm).
under these conditions, the neurons were electrically
compact and amenable to careful voltage-clamp. with
ttx (500 nm) in the bathing solution, depolarizing
pulses from a holding potential of −100 mv evoked lva
inward currents in the vast majority (338 out of 367) of
neurons recorded irrespective of their cell body diameter.
fig. 1 a gives examples of lva currents recorded in
four different drg neurons, which activated roughly
between −80 and −70 mv and were distinguishable at
first glance by their inactivation kinetics. fig. 1 a (a and d)
shows uniform slowly activating lva currents with either
very modest or almost complete inactivation during
100-ms step depolarization, respectively. these two samples represent prototypical lva currents, which we predict to be mediated by nan/ xxxg2019xxx  (fig. 1 a, a) and
t-type ca2+ channels (fig. 1 a, d).
however, in most small- and medium-sized drg
neurons, lva currents were more complex, exhibiting
more or less pronounced inactivation. hereafter we
refer to these currents as mixed-lva currents, with the
presumption that they are generated by different classes
of channels. fig. 1 a (b and c) illustrates two of such
lva currents in small-diameter drg neurons (25 and
21 pf, respectively), which had very similar thresholds
of activation but distinct inactivation kinetics. we postulated that these mixed kinetics of inactivation might
reflect differential contribution of ca2+ and na+
components to lva currents. because ca2+ current
components could not be eliminated using ca2+-free
bathing solutions due to experimental instability (see
materials and methods), we first attempted to dissect
lva currents using cadmium (cd2+), a nonselective
ca2+ channel blocker. classically, cd2+ ions are considered to preferentially block ca2+ channels over na+
channels. however, there is now good evidence that
cd2+ is also a blocker of ttx-r na+ currents (visentin
et al., 1990; backx et al., 1992; sheets and hanck, 1992;
kuo et al., 2002; leffler et al., 2005).

data and statistical analysis
pclamp 8.02 (axon instruments inc.) and prism 4.0 (graphpad) software suites were used to perform linear and nonlinear
fitting of data. we refer to lva currents as currents activating at
voltages more negative than −55 mv. current density of nan/
 xxxg2019xxx  was measured between −55 and −65 mv where sns/
 xxxg2018xxx  was absent. amplitude of sns/ xxxg2018xxx  current was estimated using a 2-s conditioning prepulse to −50 mv before test
depolarization, to inactivate the nan/ xxxg2019xxx  current, leaving
the sns/ xxxg2018xxx  current almost intact (cummins et al., 1999).
conductance–voltage curves were calculated from the peak current
according to the equation g = i/(v − erev), where v is the test
pulse potential and erev the reversal potential calculated according
to the nernst equation. the activation curve (g-v) was fitted using
the boltzmann function: g/gmax = 1/(1 + exp[(v1/2 − v)/k]),
where g/gmax is the normalized conductance, v1/2 is the potential of half-maximum channel activation, and k is the steepness factor. nan/ xxxg2019xxx  i-v curves were fitted with a curve
according to: inan(v) = gmax(v – erev)/{1 + exp[(v1/2 – v)/k]},
where inan(v) is the peak current in response to the test depolarizing potential. the time courses of inactivation and tail currents
were fitted to exponentials using the chebyshev nonlinear leastsquare fitting procedure. the concentration–inhibition curves
for channel blockers were fitted with the hill equation of the
form y = ymax[blocker]nh/(ic50nh + [blocker]nh), where y is the
percentage inhibition (e.g., 100 * i/i[blocker]=0), ic50 the blocker
concentration that produces half-maximal inhibition, and nh the
hill coefficient. results are presented as mean ± sem (or mean
± sd when indicated), and n represents the number of cells

effects of cd2+ on a sample mixed-lva current evoked
by a step depolarization to −60 mv in a small drg neuron is shown in fig. 1 b. external cd2+ reduced the peak
lva current in a dose-dependent fashion, with marked
effects on both the timing of the peak current and the
decaying kinetics of the current. isolation of lva current components blocked by cd2+ shows that low concentrations of cd2+ (30 mum) preferentially abolished
a rapidly inactivating current, while slightly higher concentrations suppressed a “persistent” current. these
findings may be explained if the total lva current were
comprised of multiple components, showing different
sensitivity to cd2+ and distinct inactivating time course.
this heterogeneity is further illustrated in fig. 1 c,

onstrating mixed kinetics. cd2+ was able to produce total inhibition of lva currents measured isochronally at
20 ms, although with variable potencies. this large variation in ic50 from 17 to 200 mum and hill coefficients from
0.8 to 1.56 clearly indicated some deviation from one-toone binding curves in most cells, suggestive of channel
heterogeneity (e.g., multiple cd2+ binding sites). to
confirm that cd2+ inhibited distinct lva current components with different inactivation kinetics, plot of the
relative current against cd2+ concentration was determined isochronally at 95 ms after the onset of the test
pulse, where “persistent” currents predominate. using
this procedure, data points could be reasonably well fitted by a one-to-one binding curve, giving ic50 ranging
from 149 to 381 mum and cooperativity coefficients ranging from 1.05 to 1.2 (fig. 1 c, ○). these observations

prompted us to suggest that the inactivating component
of lva currents with the higher sensitivity to cd2+ reflects the contribution of icat, whereas the persistent
component, which appeared to be slightly less sensitive
to cd2+, is likely to arise from nan/ xxxg2019xxx  channels.
amiloride blocks t-type ca2+ currents
but not nan/ xxxg2019xxx  current

because nan/ xxxg2019xxx  and icat cannot be distinguished
by their sensitivity to cadmium, we examined some organic agents reported to be effective in inhibiting icat
and that act via a locus independent of the metal cation
binding site. one of these agents is the  xxxd3044xxx  diuretic amiloride, which was reported to potently inhibit icat in various systems (fox et al., 1987;
tang et al., 1988; scroggs and fox, 1992; todorovic and
lingle, 1998). fig. 2 a illustrates the effects of 1 mm
amiloride on lva currents evoked at −55 mv (a voltage at which sns/ xxxg2018xxx  is absent) in both small- and
medium-sized drg neurons. the 1 mm amiloride concentration blocked about half of the mixed-lva current
in the small drg neuron. only the component of peak
current with fast inactivation, which could be attribut-

able to icat, was suppressed by amiloride, leaving the
steady-state current, attributable to nan/ xxxg2019xxx , largely
unchanged (measured at t = 95 ms). these effects
were observed in additional 49 small-sized drg neurons.
the digitally subtracted amiloride-sensitive currents in
small drg neurons had kinetics similar to those blocked
by amiloride in medium diameter putative d-hair cells,
in which large icat, recently identified as  xxxg308xxx ,
predominates (shin et al., 2003; dubreuil et al., 2004)
(fig. 2 a, b and c).
the effectiveness and selectivity of amiloride in achieving inhibition of icat but not nan/ xxxg2019xxx  was further
tested by comparing effects of amiloride applied successively at 1 and 3 mm (fig. 2, b and c). in this set of
experiments, a two-pulse protocol was used to observe
inactivating and persistent lva currents in relative
isolation. an initial prepulse to –50 mv activated mixedlva currents, but resulted in complete inactivation of
presumptive icat, leaving only persistent nan/ xxxg2019xxx  to
be available for activation in the closely timed second test
pulse. here again, amiloride blocked the inactivating
current component but had negligible effects on the
persistent component. the currents in 3 mm amiloride

showed no greater degree of block, suggesting that
1 mm amiloride was sufficient to yield a saturating block.
we then explored the effects of amiloride on sns/
 xxxg2018xxx  currents recorded in small drg neurons (22–30
pf) in which sns was predominant. it was apparent
that sns/ xxxg2018xxx  currents were largely insensitive to
amiloride. in some instances, sns/ xxxg2018xxx  peak current
was slightly decreased by 5–10% by 1 mm amiloride
(fig. s1 a, available at http://www.jgp.org/cgi/content/
full/jgp.200609665/dc1). however, this apparent
inhibition could be due to a possible contamination
arising from block of residual hva ca2+ currents by
amiloride (i.e., not blocked by our f−-containing pipette solution; see materials and methods). for this
reason, subsequent experiments designed to test the
sensitivity of sns/ xxxg2018xxx  currents to amiloride were
performed in the presence of la3+, one of the most
powerful blockers of ca2+ channels. fig. s1 b shows an
experiment in a small-diameter drg neuron (24 pf) in
the presence of 30 mum la3+ (i.e., 30 times the ic50 for
most ca2+ channels). once currents were equilibrated
in the la3+-containing solution, subsequent superfusion of amiloride in the continued presence of la3+
produced no further block of sns/ xxxg2018xxx  current at

lva and mechanical currents in subspecialized drg cells

pharmacology of nan/ xxxg2019xxx  current

we next sought to characterize nan/ xxxg2019xxx  currents
pharmacologically, using amiloride as a discriminating
tool. this analysis was performed in drg neurons in
which only nan/ xxxg2019xxx  current contributed to lva
currents in the presence of amiloride, as tested in each
cell by substituting normal external solution with a low
na+ solution (still containing 2.5 mm ca2+, which was
required for stable long-lasting recordings). we will see
below that some drg cell populations also expressed
amiloride-resistant t-type ca2+ currents.
 xxxd2638xxx , a preferential t-type ca2+ channel antagonist,
blocks nan/ xxxg2019xxx  as well as  xxxg2018xxx  current

we were also interested in examining the response of
nan/ xxxg2019xxx  current to  xxxd2638xxx , a tetralol derivative
chemically distinct from other icat antagonists, which is
known to block all three cav3 channels with equal potency (ec50, 1–3 mum; martin et al., 2000) and to cause
mechanical and thermal antinociception (todorovic
et al., 2002; dogrul et al., 2003). to study block by  xxxd2638xxx , we held cells at sufficiently negative potential (vh =
−100 mv) at which a substantial proportion of nan/
 xxxg2019xxx  channels were not slow inactivated (coste et al.,
2004). fig. 3 a shows the effects of  xxxd2638xxx  on the
nan/ xxxg2019xxx  current in a small-sized drg neuron

every 2 or 5 s until current magnitude in  xxxd2638xxx 
stabilized.  xxxd2638xxx  blocked nan/ xxxg2019xxx  channels in a
use/frequency-dependent manner, suggesting preferential binding to inactivated state(s), as previously reported
by some investigators for other channels (todorovic and
lingle, 1998; martin et al., 2000; mcnulty and hanck,
2004). dose–response curves determined using increasing concentrations of  xxxd2638xxx  in 11 small drg neurons stimulated at 1 hz yielded an ic50 of 5.15 ± 0.5 mum
(nh = 1.2) (fig. 3 b).  xxxd2638xxx  also inhibited  xxxg2018xxx /
sns currents in a use-dependent fashion, producing full
inhibition  xxxd1891xxx  mum (0.5 hz; fig. 3, c and d). block of
nan/ xxxg2019xxx  and  xxxg2018xxx /sns by  xxxd2638xxx  was reversible within 20 min (unpublished data).
sensitivity of nan/ xxxg2019xxx  current to the inorganic
ca2+ channel blockers
cadmium. nan/ xxxg2019xxx  currents were isolated by con-

tinuous superfusion with 1–3 mm amiloride. as illustrated in fig. 4 a (a), cd2+ reduced nan/ xxxg2019xxx  currents

evoked at a test potential of −60 mv in a dose-dependent manner over the range of 30 to 3,000 mum. it should
be noted that currents blocked by cd2+ lacked any hint
of the decaying kinetics that characterizes icat, as would
be expected if some ca2+ currents were left unblocked
in the presence of amiloride. we went on to compare
cd2+ block of nan/ xxxg2019xxx  current in small neurons to
block of icat recorded in d-hair mechanoreceptors,
which lacked nan/ xxxg2019xxx  (fig. 4 a, b) (fang et al.,
2006). the concentration dependence of cd2+ block of
normalized currents determined from 11 small drg
neurons and 8 medium-sized d-hair cells conformed to
one-to-one dose–response relationships with halfblocking concentrations of 233 ± 5 and 28 ± 2 mum, respectively (fig. 4 b). blockade of nan/ xxxg2019xxx  by cd2+
was fully reversible within 5 min. in addition to blocking
nan/ xxxg2019xxx  current, cd2+ appeared to shift the i-v
curves to more depolarized potentials, without noticeable effect on reversal membrane potential. this trend
was more obvious with high concentrations of cd2+ and
can be clearly seen when the currents are normalized to

to block nan/ xxxg2019xxx  current in drg cells (fig. 5). currents recorded in amiloride-containing solution were
elicited by stepping to −50 or −55 mv and exposed to
increasing concentrations of la3+ (fig. 5 a) or ni2+ (fig.
5 b), respectively. the time courses of blockade of
nan/ xxxg2019xxx  current are also illustrated (fig. 5, c and d).
the dose dependence of la3+ and ni2+ blocks did not
show major deviation from one-to-one permeation
block, with hill coefficients of 0.96 and 0.91, respectively. the affinities of la3+ and ni2+ for nan/ xxxg2019xxx 
channels spanned more than one order of magnitude,
with la3+ being the most effective blocker (ic50 = 45.8 ±
3 mum) while ni2+ possesses a 20-fold lower affinity (892.7 ±
8 mum). although not tested systematically, inhibitions
of peak nan/ xxxg2019xxx  current by both cations showed little dependence over the potentials (unpublished data),
suggestive that, just like cd2+, the blocking effects had
little intrinsic voltage dependence.

essentially voltage independent over the potentials
tested (fig. 4 c, top), indicating little intrinsic voltage
dependence of cd2+ block. this suggests that cd2+ block
of nan/ xxxg2019xxx  resulted from concurrent pore blockade and antagonism of activation, a mechanism reminiscent to that of block of sns/ xxxg2018xxx  current by

lva and mechanical currents in subspecialized drg cells

we have devised a classification scheme for the drg
cells we recorded based on the notion that functionally
uniform cell populations can be identified by their repertoire of ion channels. cells were classified according
to five cluster variables, namely, cell capacitance (pf)
and peak amplitude (normalized for cell size, pa/pf)
of nan/ xxxg2019xxx , sns/ xxxg2018xxx , amiloride-sensitive icat,
and amiloride- and ni2+-resistant icat. we then examined whether each cell cluster was homogeneous with
respect to mechanoreactivity and capsaicin sensitivity.
type-i (c-i) and type-ii (c-ii) c-nociceptive cells. drg neurons were first assigned to c-nociceptive cells on the
basis of their small cell membrane capacitance (14 pf <
cm < 40 pf, n = 78) and the presence of nan/ xxxg2019xxx 
current, a marker of nociceptive cells (benn et al.,
2001; fang et al., 2002). these c-type cells could be
readily classified into two distinct, but internally homogeneous, subsets of nociceptive cells with very uniform
nan/ xxxg2019xxx  and sns/ xxxg2018xxx  currents but very different icat signatures. cells clustering in c-i type made up
65% of c-nociceptors (cm = 32 ± 2 pf, range from 25 to
40 pf, n = 51/78) and displayed peak current densities
for nan/ xxxg2019xxx  and sns/ xxxg2018xxx  of 12 ± 3 and 36 ± 4
pa/pf, respectively. a representative example of a cell
(25 pf) clustered in this subgroup is illustrated in fig. 6.
c-i type nociceptive cells exhibited an amiloride-sensitive
icat, which had a mean peak current density of 6.7 ±
1.1 pa/pf and a half-maximal activation (v1/2) of −65 ±
1.5 mv (fig. 6, a–d). this current was fully blocked by
low micromolar concentrations of la3+ (10 mum) and
ni2+ (50 mum; ic50 = 28 mum) (unpublished data). in this
category of cells, 1 mm amiloride entirely blocked icat,
as no lva currents were left in the presence of low na+
(2 mm) external solution (fig. 6, b and c). nan/ xxxg2019xxx

they were more rarely encountered and made up 35%
of the c-cell population (n = 27/78). note that these
proportions are only indicative since they may vary
according to sampling bias and technical limitations
(especially when recording small cells). this subset of
cells exhibited peak current densities for nan/ xxxg2019xxx 

and sns/ xxxg2018xxx  (15.6 ± 4 pa/pf and 37.5 ± 6 pa/pf,
respectively) that were not significantly different from
those of c-i type nociceptive cells, but had a fivefold
larger (35.7 ± 8 pa/pf) amiloride-sensitive icat (figs.
7, a–c). the amiloride-sensitive ca2+ current in these
cells had kinetics and voltage dependence essentially
identical to c-i type nociceptive cells, with a v1/2 of −65 ±
0.8 mv and a steepness factor of 4.4 ± 0.3 mv (fig.
7 f). in addition, these cells also expressed an icat resistant to amiloride (mean peak current density of 5.5 ±
2 pa/pf), as substituting external na+ in the presence
of amiloride did not abolish lva currents (fig. 7 ab
and c–f). the amiloride-resistant icat was fully blocked
by 10 mum la3+ (fig. 7, c and e) and, in contrast to the
amiloride-sensitive icat, was only half-reduced by 260 mum
ni2+ (not depicted). this current had inactivation and

within this cell subset, sns/ xxxg2018xxx  amplitudes were
typically ≥5 na (142 ± 20 pa/pf). the lack of amilorideresistant icat allowed us to precisely investigate the voltage dependence and kinetics of nan/ xxxg2019xxx  current in
these cells. over the whole potential range tested, the
inactivation kinetics of nan/ xxxg2019xxx  current is slow (fig.

with an e-fold change in time constant per 19 and 13.5

constant for deactivation of nan/ xxxg2019xxx  observed upon
repolarization at −100 mv was 590 ± 5 mus, which is at
least twofold faster than that of the amiloride-sensitive
icat (1.3 ± 0.1 ms; fig. 8 d). the amiloride-sensitive
icat in adelta-like nociceptive cells had a v1/2 of −65 ± 1 mv,

identical to nan/ xxxg2019xxx  currents expressed in c-i and

distinction between ma currents expressed by c-i and

of their soma with ma cation currents, of which 15 were

cells that were classified as d-hair cells had mediumdiameter cell bodies (54 ± 5.6 pf, range 39–65 pf).
they proved to be substantially different from other
current signature-classified cells in that they displayed
very typical icat (“giant icat”; shin et al., 2003;
dubreuil et al., 2004) and were insensitive to capsaicin
(1 mum). all the cells clustered in this subgroup exhibited uniform ma cation currents (erev −2 mv), which
typically required low stimulus intensity to activate (fig.
10 a). the minimum distance travelled by the probe
to evoke a response was 6.5 ± 1.5 mum, thereby classifying these cells as low-threshold mechanoreceptors. ma
currents in d-hair cells had rapidly adapting kinetics
with time constants ranging from 10 to 50 ms. encoding of the intensity of the stimulus was demonstrated
by the graded responses to varying mechanical stimulus

applied through the glass probe. it should be noted that
suprathreshold mechanical stimuli typically evoked ma
currents with both transient and sustained components
(fig. 10 a, inset). low-threshold ma cation currents in
d-hair cells were found to be more sensitive to amiloride
than high-threshold ma currents in c nociceptive cells,
with 95 ± 3% block by 1 mm amiloride (fig. 10 b and
fig. 12 c).
lva inward currents in d-hair mechanoreceptive
cells did not appear to be fully antagonized by 1–3 mm
amiloride (fig. 10, c and d). substituting external na+
revealed that d-hair cells also displayed an amilorideresistant icat. this current was fully blocked by 10 mum
la3+ but showed little sensitivity to ni2+ (ic50 = 245
mum; unpublished data). fig. 10 (c–e) illustrates the two
components of icat in a single d-hair cell (52 pf). in a
representative group of 39 cells, mean peak amplitudes
of the amiloride-sensitive and amiloride-resistant icat
were 93.3 ± 26 and 10.9 ± 3 pa/pf, respectively. their
voltage dependence (v1/2 of −65 ± 1.5 and −63 ± 1.5
mv, respectively) was not significantly different from
those in c-ii nociceptors (fig. 10 e). note that a small
 xxxg2018xxx /sns-like current (11.9 ± 4 pa/pf, n = 18), but
not  xxxg2019xxx /nan, was routinely detected in d-hair
mechanoreceptive cells (arrow in fig. 10 d, fig. 12 a,
and fig. 13).
large (aalpha/beta-like) drg cells express low-threshold,
intermediately adapting ma cation currents, different
t-type ca2+ currents, but no lva ttx-r na+ currents

cells that clustered in this subgroup fell within the
large cell range (70–105 pf) and in all cases but one
were found to be insensitive to capsaicin. in addition
to difference in size, these cells displayed distinguishing current signatures that serve to discriminate them
from other cell types. (a) lva currents were conducted
essentially through amiloride-sensitive and amilorideresistant icat, while lva ttx-r na+ currents were undetectable (fig. 11, a and b). in a representative group
of 18 cells, mean peak amplitudes of the amiloridesensitive and amiloride-resistant icat were 10 ± 3 and
3.75 ± 2.5 pa/pf, respectively. (b) these cells had
powerful hva ica, which was two- to threefold larger in
amplitude than those in d-hair cells (comparison using
cscl-based pipette solution; see materials and methods).
(c) relatively small sns/ xxxg2018xxx -type currents were seen
in these large cells with a mean peak current amplitude
of 12.5 ± 5 pa/pf. (d) all these cells exhibited ma cation currents (erev = −3 ± 1 mv), which had intermediately adapting kinetics with voltage-independent time
constants ranging from 70 to 90 ms (fig. 11, c and d).
these ma currents activated in response to small probe
displacements (8 ± 1 mum) and were equally permeable
to k+, na+, and cs+ and less to ca2+ with a pca/pna selectivity of 1–3. in contrast to other cell types, ma cation
currents in large cells were less susceptible to block by

low-threshold mechanoreceptors (see below). therefore, because of their relatively high pressure threshold
and sensitivity to capsaicin, most c-i nociceptors were
tentatively classified as high-threshold c-mechanoheat
(possibly polymodal) nociceptors. high-threshold ma
currents in these cells were inhibited by 79 ± 6% by
1 mm amiloride, irrespective of the capsaicin sensitivity
of the cell (unpublished data; see fig. 12 c).
although c-ii type nociceptors had somewhat smaller
cell bodies, which rendered difficult systematic investigation of their mechanical sensitivity, ma currents could
be evoked in 32% of these cells (figs. 9, b and d–f),
of which very few (1/9) were found to be responsive
to capsaicin. these ma currents were activated by relatively high pressure (14 ± 2 mum; fig. 9 b). therefore,
mechanoreactive c-ii cells were tentatively classified as
high-threshold c-mechanonociceptors. ma currents
had reversal potential of −4 ± 2 mv and nearly linear
i-v relationships in asymmetrical solution, indicating nonselective permeability. in contrast to c-i nociceptors, ma
currents in c-ii nociceptive cells did not decline in amplitude during the stationary part of the 200-ms stimulus,
i.e., showed nonadapting kinetics (fig. 9 b). kinetics
analysis further revealed an interesting additional facet
of these nonadapting ma currents. typically, current
amplitude continued to increase for a period of 10–30
ms after the cessation of probe movement, whereas the
current declined as soon as the pressure was removed. in
addition, the amplitude of repeatedly evoked nonadapting ma currents could be stable for up to 2 h and typically reached a plateau as higher pressures were applied
(fig. 9 d). nonadapting ma currents were inhibited by
82 ± 3% by 1 mm amiloride (fig. 9 e and fig. 12 c). no
ma whole-cell currents could be evoked in adelta-like nociceptive cells using the most intense mechanical stimuli
that could be applied to the neuron without disrupting
the seal (fig. 9 c).

a major purpose of this paper was to present a view of
drg cell lva channel heterogeneity developed from
over 3 years work on drg neurons. we first sought to
identify the different components of lva currents in
single cells by defining a method for better separation
of nan/ xxxg2019xxx  and icat. one major finding is that
amiloride, but not inorganic ca2+ channel blockers, can
be readily used to discriminate icat and nan/ xxxg2019xxx 
current. using amiloride as a discriminative agent,
we provided evidence that lva currents measured in
each of the 338 cells included in this study were composed of nan/ xxxg2019xxx  and/or amiloride-sensitive icat,
which coexisted with various extents from one cell to
the other. moreover, it quickly became apparent that
under conditions where nan/ xxxg2019xxx  was eliminated,
total icat was not fully inhibited by amiloride. the
amiloride-resistant icat, which has been overlooked in
previous studies, could be unambiguously distinguished
from amiloride-sensitive icat on both pharmacological
and biophysical grounds. in addition to differences in
amiloride sensitivity, this current was also distinct in its
sensitivity to ni2+, with an ic50 of 240–260 mum, which
is 10-fold higher than that of the amiloride-sensitive
icat (28 mum). recorded under physiological [ca2+]o,
the two identified types of icat have very similar voltage
dependence, with amiloride-sensitive icat activating at
most negative and amiloride-resistant icat at slightly
more positive potentials.
three types of icat,  xxxg307xxx ,  xxxg308xxx , and  xxxg309xxx , have
been cloned (cribbs et al., 1998; perez-reyes et al.,
1998; lee et al., 1999). based on kinetics data and the
fact that of the three cloned t-channels only  xxxg308xxx  is
blocked by micromolar concentrations of ni2+ while
much higher concentrations are required to half-block
 xxxg307xxx  (250 mum) and  xxxg309xxx  (216 mum) (lee et al., 1999;
perez-reyes, 2003), we suggest that the  xxxg308xxx  channel
profile corresponds closely to that of the amiloridesensitive icat. on the other hand, the slow inactivation
kinetics of the amiloride-resistant icat, along with its
relative resistance to ni2+ and amiloride, may support
the assumption that  xxxg309xxx , which gives rise to slowly
inactivating icat (gomora et al., 2002), represents the
counterpart of the amiloride-resistant icat. this is in accord with in situ hybridization data, which showed that
drg cells express  xxxg308xxx  and  xxxg309xxx  mrna but no
 xxxg307xxx  mrna (talley et al., 1999). this inference is
supported by the observations that peripheral pain
behavior is unaffected in  xxxg307xxx −/− mice (kim et al.,
2001) and that expression level of the  xxxg309xxx  gene is
reduced in nt-4−/− mice, indicating that  xxxg309xxx  is coexpressed with  xxxg308xxx  in d-hair mechanoreceptors
(shin et al., 2003).
a logical extension of these findings was to determine
the pharmacological profile of nan/ xxxg2019xxx , which was

five distinct cell types were identified from small-, medium-, and large-diameter cell populations. c-i and c-ii type nociceptors are distinguished by the amplitude of the amiloride-sensitive icat ( xxxg308xxx ), the presence of amiloride-resistant icat (putative  xxxg309xxx ), and, when
detected, the properties of the ma current. the combination of large amiloride-sensitive icat ( xxxg308xxx ), rapidly adapting ma currents,
unresponsiveness to capsaicin, and absence of nan/ xxxg2019xxx  is particularly important to distinguish d-hair cells from medium-sized
adelta-like cells. the low-threshold mechanoreceptors, aalpha/beta-like and d-hair cells, are distinguished by the kinetics of their ma currents.

the present investigations. first, inorganic ca2+ channel blockers are potent inhibitors of nan/ xxxg2019xxx , with
the following rank order (ic50): la3+ (46 mum) > cd2+
(233 mum) > ni2+ (892 mum). metal cations had two effects: they blocked nan/ xxxg2019xxx  and shifted the voltage
dependence of gating, suggestive of two sites of action.
this dual mechanism via pore block and antagonistic effect on channel activation has previously been reported
for block of sns/ xxxg2018xxx  (kuo et al., 2004). thus, our
data indicate that nan/ xxxg2019xxx  shares pharmacological
properties with icat, raising some doubt as to the suitability of metal cations as agents capable of distinguishing

nan/ xxxg2019xxx  from ca2+ channels. moreover because
cd2+ can alter nan/ xxxg2019xxx  gating, our results emphasize that absence of multivalent cations is critical in assaying functional properties of nan/ xxxg2019xxx  channels.
by doing so with the use of amiloride, we demonstrated
that nan/ xxxg2019xxx  current was selectively, although variably, expressed in c-i-, c-ii-, and adelta-nociceptive cells,
in agreement with immunological studies (fang et al.,
2002). second, we show that  xxxd2638xxx , a preferential
icat antagonist, is a potent blocker of nan/ xxxg2019xxx  (ic50,
5 mum).  xxxd2638xxx  blocked nan/ xxxg2019xxx  in a frequencydependent manner, indicating preferential binding to

electrophysiologically deﬁned drg cells express
distinct mechanosensitive channels

based on ion channel signatures, five groups of internally homogeneous drg cells could be distinguished
by cluster analysis (see fig. 12 a and fig. 13). small
drg cells could be subdivided into two groups that represented 65% (c-i type) and 35% (c-ii type) of c-cells.
systematic delineation of c-i and c-ii type cells showed
that they display identical densities of nan/ xxxg2019xxx  and
 xxxg2018xxx /sns currents. despite these similarities, clustered c-ii cells could be readily distinguished from c-i
type cells by an approximately fivefold larger icat. we
showed that icat arises from both  xxxg308xxx  and possibly
 xxxg309xxx  channels, with a prominent contribution of the
former. these cells closely resemble a novel class of
small drg cells recently designated as “t-rich” and
which have prevalent t-type over hva ca2+ currents
(nelson et al., 2005). although it is difficult to place our
cell classes in direct comparison with previous studies
due to different strategies of characterizing cells, our
c-i type cells match the type-1 cells of cardenas et al.
(1995) and petruska et al. (2000) with respect to cell
size, capsaicin-currents, and icat density. based on capsaicin sensitivity and mechanoreactivity, we propose
that c-i type cells comprise c-thermonociceptors and
c-mechanoheat nociceptors, while c-ii type cells contain two subspecialized groups principally composed of
c-thermonociceptors and c-mechanonociceptors.
during the course of recordings, we also examined
the signatures of 96 medium cells, from which 66 could
be studied in detail and fell into two uniform classes
(fig. 12 a and fig. 13). cells tentatively classified as
adelta-nociceptors are mostly responsive to capsaicin and
have large nan/ xxxg2019xxx  and substantial  xxxg308xxx  current but no sizeable amiloride-resistant icat, whereas

lva and mechanical currents in subspecialized drg cells

d-hair cells, besides being insensitive to capsaicin and
lacking nan/ xxxg2019xxx , can be reliably identified by their
“giant”  xxxg308xxx  current (white et al., 1989; cardenas
et al., 1995; shin et al., 2003; dubreuil et al., 2004) (fig.
12 a and fig. 13). cells clustering in the fifth group,
possibly corresponding to aalpha/beta-mechanoreceptors,
were generally capsaicin insensitive, had small icat,
had no nan/ xxxg2019xxx  current, and exhibited powerful
hva ca2+ currents in agreement with scroggs and fox
(1992). in addition, it should be noted that sns/ xxxg2018xxx 
current was found to be prominently expressed in cells
classified as nociceptive (fig. 12 c and fig. 13), which
correlates well with the notion that broad somatic action
potential is a fingerprint of nociceptive units in vivo
(fang et al., 2005).
current signature-identified cells were uniform in
term of mechanosensitivity. mechanoreactive cells in
c-i and c-ii groups responded primarily to the static phase
of the stimulus and to high levels of mechanical force,
suggestive of their putative function as high-threshold
mechanonociceptors. importantly, the observation that
ma currents in c-i and c-ii cells have distinct inactivation rates (fig. 12 b) suggests that they may differentially shape the electroresponsiveness of receptor
endings. in this regard, it is important to note that the
kinetics of ma currents in c-i (slowly adapting) and c-ii
(nonadapting) nociceptive cells in the present study are
well suited to sustain the discharges observed in vivo in
c-mechanoheat nociceptors (e.g., slowly adapting) and
c-mechanonociceptors (e.g., sustained), respectively
(see fig. 2 in lewin and moshourad, 2004).
in contrast, medium and large nonnociceptive drg
cells responded to the ramp phase of the stimulus and
to low levels of mechanical force, with either rapidly
(d-hair cells) or intermediately (aalpha/beta-like cells) adapting
ma currents, consistent with their function as lowthreshold mechanoreceptors. these ma currents are
also well suited to sustain the in vivo activity of rapidly
adapting d-hair mechanoreceptors and “slowly” adapting aalpha/beta-mechanoreceptors, respectively (see lewin
and moshourab, 2004).
unexpectedly, adelta-neurons were refractory to mechanical stimulation. given the common polymodal nature
of these cells (lawson, 2002), it is possible that adelta-like
cells have higher mechanical thresholds that were not
reached before disruption of pipette seals. of relevance,
trpa1, which has just been suggested to contribute to
mechanotransduction in c-fiber nociceptors (kwan
et al., 2006; but see bautista et al., 2006), is not expressed in adelta mechanonociceptors (kobayashi et al.,
2005). therefore it is likely that another high-threshold
ma channel exists in adelta mechanonociceptors.
nonselective currents activated by pressure applied to
the soma were previously reported in drg neurons
(mccarter et al., 1999; drew et al., 2002, 2004). these
currents were generally consistent with the ma currents

states visited during the depolarization. moreover, the
degree of block correlated well with the extent of the
slow inactivation (unpublished data), suggesting that
the slow time course of block during repeated stimulation results from interaction with slow-inactivated
nan/ xxxg2019xxx  channels. state-dependent block by  xxxd2638xxx  has been recently shown for other na+ channel
isoforms, including the ttx-r  xxxg2028xxx  (mcnulty and
hanck, 2004). thus, although  xxxd2638xxx  exhibits a
higher affinity in blocking icat over hva ca2+ currents
(clozel et al., 1997; martin et al., 2000), it also has micromolar affinity for nan/ xxxg2019xxx  channels, pointing to
a potentially common  xxxd2638xxx -binding motif across
targets. given that  xxxd2638xxx  is known to reverse some
experimental pain states (todorovic et al., 2002; dogrul
et al., 2003), such cross-reactivity with nan/ xxxg2019xxx ,
another important target for antinociceptive agents,
suggests that  xxxd2638xxx ’s antinociceptive actions might
involve interaction with multiple ion channels rather
than selective inhibition of icat.

observed in the present study. we have however obtained contradictory results concerning the pharmacology of the ma currents in that we found that ma
currents in different drg cell subpopulations are inhibited by amiloride, though with various extent (fig.
12 c). this is at odds with data by drew et al. (2002),
which showed no effects of amiloride on ma currents
but accords well with those by mccarter et al. (1999),
which reported that ma currents in drg cells are sensitive to the amiloride derivative benzamil. nevertheless,
the diversity of mechanosensitive channel kinetics,
threshold, and pharmacological sensitivity means that
different types of channels, although possibly related,
are involved in the transduction processes of low- and
high-threshold mechanoreceptors. furthermore, our
study also provides some hints that the high-threshold
mechanotransducer in nociceptive neurons may not be
a single channel entity. although there are several interesting candidate channels that can form an amiloride/
gadolinium-blockable channel, including some members of the deg/enac, asic, and trp channel families
(waldmann and lazdunski, 1998; price et al., 2000;
delmas, 2004; mcilwrath et al., 2005; hu et al., 2006;
kwan et al., 2006), it is not yet clear which channels
form the core mechanosensory apparatus in both lowand high-threshold mechanoreceptors.
