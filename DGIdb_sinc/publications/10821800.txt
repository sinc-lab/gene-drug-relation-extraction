1 the endothelial 5-ht receptor mediating relaxation of pig pulmonary artery has been
characterized using the selective  xxxg1114xxx  agonist bw 723c86 and a variety of structurally
diverse 5-ht receptor antagonists.
2 if arterial rings with intact endothelium were precontracted with prostaglandin f2a (3 mm), bw
723c86 caused concentration-dependent relaxation with a pec50=8.21+0.03 and emax=89+4%
relative to 5-ht. the relaxant responses to bw 723c86 were inhibited by the  xxxg1114xxx 
antagonist sb 204741, the 5-ht2b/2c receptor antagonist sb 206553 and the  xxxd2022xxx  drug
pizotifen, yielding pa2 values of 6.68, 7.20 and 8.32, respectively. the pa2 values against bw
723c86 were similar to those determined against 5-ht.
3 the relaxant eect of 5-ht was antagonized by a variety of 22 compounds of diverse chemical
structures. based on the calculated mean pa2 values the order of the most potent antagonists was
ritanserin (9.38) 4  xxxd2621xxx  (8.86) 4 pizotifen (8.47) 5 methiothepin (8.32) 4 ly 53857 (7.84)

(7.39). compounds with weak blocking potency were yohimbine (6.37), spiperone (5.88) and
 xxxd2419xxx  (5.85). correlation analysis between the anities of the antagonists in pig pulmonary
artery and those from radioligand binding studies at human and rat 5-ht2b receptors showed a
highly signi®cant correlation (r=0.95 and 0.84, p50.002 and 50.005). correlation with 5-ht2c
receptors was much lower (r=0.57, p=0.035), and no correlations were obtained with  xxxg1119xxx  and 5ht7 receptors.
4 it is concluded that the 5-ht receptor mediating endothelium-dependent relaxation of pig
pulmonary artery is of the 5-ht2b subtype.

introduction
it has been shown that the vasculature is endowed with a
variety of speci®c 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-ht) receptors.
contraction of blood vessels to 5-ht is mediated via smooth
muscle 5-ht1b/1d (formerly 5-ht1-like) receptors and/or
smooth muscle 5-ht2a receptors (saxena & villaloân, 1990;
hartig et al., 1996; saxena et al., 1998). relaxation to 5-ht is
mediated via activation of both smooth muscle 5-ht7
receptors or atypical endothelial 5-ht receptors coupled to
the release of  xxxd2738xxx  (see hoyer et al., 1994; martin, 1994
for reviews). the existence of relaxant 5-ht7 receptors has
been demonstrated in rabbit femoral vein (martin & wilson,
1995), cynomolgus monkey jugular vein (leung et al., 1996),
canine coronary artery (terroân, 1996; cushing et al., 1996),
rabbit pulmonary artery (morecroft & maclean, 1998), and
canine basilar and middle cerebral arteries (terroân & falcoânneri, 1999). by contrast, there has been some controversy over
the exact nature of endothelial 5-ht receptor subtype(s)
(sumner, 1991; martin et al., 1993; martin, 1994). at the
present time there seems to be a fairly clear consensus that two
distinct receptor types may be involved in the endotheliumdependent relaxant eect of 5-ht. in pig coronary artery
(schoeter & hoyer, 1990) and guinea-pig jugular vein

*author for correspondence; e-mail: glusa@zmkh.ef.uni-jena.de

(gupta, 1992) the endothelial 5-ht receptors resemble the 5ht1b/1d (formerly 5-ht1-like) receptor subtype, whereas the
relaxant 5-ht receptor in rat jugular vein (ellis et al., 1995),
canine vena cava (grayson & gupta, 1995), pig cerebral artery
(schmuck et al., 1996) and pig pulmonary artery (glusa &
richter, 1993; glusa & roos, 1996) exhibits operational
characteristics similar to the  xxxg1114xxx .
an important advance in the characterization of 5-ht2b
receptor-mediated eects represent the tryptamine analogue
bw 723c86. this compound is a potent partial agonist at 5ht2b receptors in rat stomach fundus (ellis et al., 1994), canine
vena cava (grayson & gupta, 1995), and rat jugular vein (ellis
et al., 1995). on the other hand, bw 723c86 displays lower
potency at both 5-ht2a and 5-ht2c receptors in various
functional assays (ellis et al., 1994; baxter et al., 1995; baxter,
1996; kennett et al., 1997).
the aim of the present study was to characterize the 5-ht
receptor responsible for endothelium-dependent relaxation of
pig pulmonary artery by means of the  xxxg1114xxx  agonist
bw 723c86. since agonist potencies by themselves do not
allow de®nitive characterization of receptors, we also
examined the eect of various 5-ht receptor antagonists
generally used to characterize 5-ht2b, 5-ht2c,  xxxg1119xxx  and 5ht7 receptors such as the selective  xxxg1114xxx  antagonist
sb 204741, ergolines and tricyclic psychotropic agents (table

e. glusa & h.h. pertz

1) (baxter, 1996; monsma et al., 1993; roth et al., 1994). based
on the potencies of the antagonists used, further evidence is
presented that the relaxant receptor has the characteristics of
the  xxxg1114xxx  subtype. a preliminary report of some of
these data has been published previously (roos & glusa,
1998).

methods
experimental protocol
pig lungs were obtained from the local slaughter-house. small
branches of pulmonary arteries were dissected and carefully
cleaned of parenchyma and connective tissue. up to six rings
(2 ± 3 mm long and 1.5 ± 2 mm wide) were horizontally
suspended between two l-shaped platinum hooks (150 mm
diameter) and mounted in a 10 ml organ bath ®lled with
modi®ed krebs-henseleit-solution of the following composition (mm): nacl 118, kcl 4.7, cacl2 2.5,  xxxd2534xxx  1.2, kh2po4
1.2, nahco3 25, and d-glucose 11. the solution was
continuously gassed with 95% o2/5% co2 and warmed to a
constant temperature of 378c. preparations were connected to
an isometric force transducer (hugo sachs elektronik, march,
germany) and changes in tension were recorded continuously.
resting tension was adjusted to 20 mn at the beginning of
each experiment. during an initial stabilization period of
60 min, the bathing medium was changed every 20 min and the
tension repeatedly readjusted to 20 mn. the tissues were
stimulated at intervals of 45 min once with kcl (30 mm) and
three times with prostaglandin f2a ( xxxd1902xxx ; 3 mm) until the
contractile response had become constant. the integrity of the
endothelium was assessed functionally by measuring the extent

 xxxg1114xxx  in pig pulmonary arteries

693

of endothelium-dependent relaxation following application of
bradykinin (10 nm).
the relaxant response to 5-ht (control) and bw 723c86
was studied after the third  xxxd1902xxx  (3 mm)-induced contraction
had stabilized, by constructing a cumulative concentrationresponse curve in the absence and presence of antagonist. each
successive agonist concentration was administered when the
response had reached a plateau; this occurred generally after
2 ± 4 min. relaxant eects were expressed as a percentage of
the  xxxd1902xxx -induced contraction. antagonists were added
30 min before the construction of agonist concentrationresponse curves. the eects of antagonists were investigated
in ring segments adjacent to those used as controls.

data presentation and statistical evaluation
data are presented as mean+s.e.mean for n separate
experiments, using vessels from dierent animals. agonist
concentration-eect curves were ®tted using the computer
program graphpad prism 3.0 (graphpad software, san
diego, ca, u.s.a.). agonist potencies and maximum
response were expressed as pec50 values (negative logarithm
of the molar concentration of agonist producing 50% of the
maximum response) and emax values, respectively. the
potencies of the antagonists were expressed as either an
apparent or a full pa2 value. the apparent pa2 value was
calculated from the equation pa2=7log c(b)+log (cr71),
where c(b) is the negative logarithm of the molar concentration of antagonist and cr the ratio of agonist ec50 measured
in the presence of antagonist over that measured in the absence
of antagonist (furchgott, 1972). the full pa2 value was
determined using the method of arunlakshana & schild
(1959). for the calculation of pa2 values from schild plot,

 xxxg1114xxx  in pig pulmonary arteries

the  xxxg1114xxx  agonist bw 723c86 (1 ± 100 nm) was
found to induce concentration-dependent relaxation of pgf2aprecontracted pig pulmonary artery with intact endothelium.
relaxation was absent in endothelium-denuded arteries. bw
723c86 was a partial agonist relative to 5-ht
(pec50=8.21+0.03, emax=89+4%; n=22). the 5-ht2b
receptor antagonist sb 204741 (0.1 ± 3 mm) produced a parallel
concentration-dependent rightward shift of the concentrationresponse curve to bw 723c86 with no signi®cant eect on
maximum response (figure 1). schild analysis yielded a
straight line with a full pa2 value of 6.68+0.05 (slope of the
schild plot 0.87+0.06, not signi®cantly dierent from unity).
in a similar manner, endothelium-dependent relaxation to bw
723c86 was antagonized by the 5-ht2b/2c receptor antagonist
sb 206553 (0.3 ± 3 mm) yielding a full pa2 value of 7.20+0.11
(slope of the schild plot 1.10+0.10, not signi®cantly dierent
from unity) (figure 2). furthermore, relaxation to bw 723c86
was antagonized by pizotifen (10 nm) with an apparent pa2
value of 8.32+0.08 (n=4). since the calculated pa2 values for

in the present study the functional integrity of the vascular
endothelium was evaluated by allowing  xxxd1902xxx  (3 mm)-precontracted arteries to relax following the addition of bradykinin
(10 nm). the bradykinin-induced relaxation amounted to
86+4% (n=30). the relaxation was abolished after mechanical
removal of the endothelium or after preincubation with ngnitro-l-arginine methyl ester (l-name; 200 mm).

sb 204741, sb 206553 and pizotifen against the relaxant eect
of bw 723c86 matched the anity of these antagonists
against the relaxant eect of 5-ht, the involvement of a
common receptor site can be suggested (table 2). it should be
emphasized that neither bw 723c86 (1 ± 100 nm) nor 5-ht
(0.1 ± 100 nm) were able to induce contractile responses of
quiescent rings of pig pulmonary artery, with and without
endothelium.

antagonist studies
a number of structurally dierent compounds were tested
against the relaxant eect of 5-ht, the results of the antagonist
potencies are given in table 3. the figures 3 and 4
demonstrate the inhibitory eects of two representatives from
the compounds used, pizotifen and ly53857. the antagonists
caused a concentration-dependent rightward shift of the
concentration-response curve to 5-ht with little or no eect
on maximum response with the exception of ritanserin,
 xxxd2621xxx  and methiothepin which antagonized the
relaxant eect of 5-ht in an unsurmountable manner. among
the compounds tested ritanserin,  xxxd2621xxx , pizotifen and
methiothepin proved to be the most potent antagonists (mean
pa2 values from 9.4 ± 8.3). the tricyclic psychotropic drugs
blocked the relaxant eect of 5-ht with mean pa2 values of
7.8 ± 6.5. among both the rauwol®a alkaloids rauwolscine
(pa2 7.4) was more potent than yohimbine (pa2 6.4).
compounds with weak blocking potency were spiperone

 xxxg1114xxx  in pig pulmonary arteries

discussion
it has been proposed that endothelial 5-ht2b receptors
mediate vascular relaxation by the release of no (see baxter
et al., 1995 for review). in previous studies on pig pulmonary
artery it was shown that the 5-ht-induced relaxation was due
to the release of endothelial no followed by an increase in
 xxxd1274xxx  in smooth muscle cells (glusa & richter, 1993).
however, it was not unequivocally clari®ed whether the
relaxation is mediated via endothelial 5-ht2c or 5-ht2b
receptors (glusa & richter, 1993; glusa & roos, 1996). the
existence of the 5-ht2b mrna transcript in pig pulmonary
artery implies the expression of the  xxxg1114xxx  protein in
this tissue (ulmer et al., 1995). the present study demonstrates
that the selective  xxxg1114xxx  agonist bw 723c86 caused
an endothelium-dependent relaxation of pig pulmonary artery.
the potent partial agonist activity of bw 723c86 in pig
pulmonary artery (pec50=8.21) is consistent with the ®ndings
at 5-ht2b receptors in rat stomach fundus (ellis et al., 1994),
rat jugular vein (ellis et al., 1995) and dog vena cava (grayson
& gupta, 1995). further evidence for the involvement of 5ht2b receptors in relaxation of pig pulmonary artery was
provided by the antagonist pro®le of sb 204741, a highly
selective  xxxg1114xxx  antagonist. sb 204741 acted as
competitive antagonist against the relaxant eects of bw
723c86 and 5-ht, respectively. the anity for sb 204741
(pa2=6.7 against bw 723c86 and 6.6 against 5.ht) was in

baxter et al., 1994), dog vena cava (pa2=7.5; grayson &
gupta, 1995), and cloned human 5-ht2b receptors (pki=6.7;
thomas et al., 1996).
a signi®cant correlation between the anity estimates in
pig pulmonary artery with those in radioligand binding studies
was obtained with cloned human 5-ht2b receptors and cloned
rat 5-ht2b receptors, respectively. in contrast, the correlation
was less favourable at the  xxxg1115xxx  subtype (r=0.57).
a variety of studies has demonstrated a high degree of
pharmacological similarity between 5-ht2b and 5-ht2c
receptors. unfortunately, there are only few drugs which are
able to discriminate between both closely related subtypes (see
baxter et al., 1995). in addition to sb 204741 which displays at
least 10 fold selectivity for 5-ht2b versus 5-ht2c receptors,
both subtypes may be further delineated by the use of
yohimbine, rauwolscine and  xxxd2419xxx . yohimbine and
rauwolscine have been shown to possess moderately high
anity for 5-ht2b receptors but a much lower anity for 5ht2c receptors, whereas  xxxd2419xxx  has been shown to possess
higher anity for 5-ht2c than for 5-ht2b receptors (baxter et
al., 1995; baxter, 1996; see also table 1). the anities
estimated in the present study for rauwolscine, yohimbine and
 xxxd2419xxx  argue for a role of 5-ht2b receptors in endotheliumdependent relaxation of pig pulmonary artery. the good
correlation between antagonist pa2 values and pki values for
human and rat 5-ht2b binding sites supports this ®nding
(figure 5). pig and human 5-ht2b receptors have been shown
to possess 95% sequence homology, while the sequence
homology of the pig  xxxg1114xxx  with the rat homologue
is 87% (ulmer et al., 1995). although it could be demonstrated
that the human  xxxg1114xxx  has an overall pharmacological pro®le consistent with its rat homologue, some dierences
have been detected which suggest that the 5-ht2b receptors are
not a pharmacologically homogeneous class of receptors
schmuck et al., 1996; wainscott et al., 1996). in this

connection, yohimbine justi®es special mention since this drug
showed appreciably lower anity for 5-ht2b receptors in pig
pulmonary artery than in rat jugular vein (pa2=7.3; ellis et
al., 1995), rat stomach fundus (pa2=6.9 ± 7.8; audia et al.,
1996; baxter et al., 1994) and cloned rat 5-ht2b receptors
(pki=7.3; wainscott et al., 1996). the discrepancy between
our observations in the pig and those in the rat provides
further evidence that species homologues exist in pharmacology of 5-ht2b receptors (see also bonhaus et al., 1995; baxter
et al., 1995 for review).
it has been shown that several drugs from structurally
dierent classes (e.g., ergolines, tricyclic psychotropic drugs)
possess high anity for 5-ht2c receptors and also for  xxxg1119xxx 
and 5-ht7 receptors (monsma et al., 1993; shen et al., 1993;
roth et al., 1994). these compounds were used to demonstrate
whether  xxxg1119xxx  and 5-ht7 receptors, respectively, might be
involved in endothelium-dependent relaxation of pig pulmonary artery. in this regard, it is worth pointing out that mrna
for 5-ht7 receptors has been found to be expressed in this
tissue (ulmer et al., 1995). by contrast,  xxxg1119xxx  mrna has not
been detected in peripheral organs studied (kohen et al., 1996).
the present ®ndings suggest that there is no role for  xxxg1119xxx  and
5-ht7 receptors in endothelium-dependent relaxation in blood
vessels.
in conclusion, by using the selective  xxxg1114xxx 
agonist bw 723c86 and a large number of structurally
dierent antagonists, the present data provide further evidence
that the endothelial receptor mediating relaxation of pig
pulmonary artery is a  xxxg1114xxx .
