abstract
angiogenesis and signaling through the raf/mitogen-activated
protein/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (erk) kinase
(mek)/erk cascade have been reported to play important
roles in the development of hepatocellular carcinomas (hcc).
sorafenib ( xxxd3226xxx , nexavar) is a multikinase inhibitor
with activity against  xxxg1924xxx  and several receptor tyrosine
kinases, including  xxxg2413xxx  receptor 2
( xxxg1274xxx ), platelet-derived growth factor receptor ( xxxg1709xxx   xxxg1710xxx ),
 xxxg801xxx , ret, and c- xxxg1279xxx . in this study, we investigated the in vitro
effects of sorafenib on plc/prf/5 and hepg2 hcc cells and the
in vivo antitumor efficacy and mechanism of action on plc/
prf/5 human tumor xenografts in severe combined immunodeficient mice. sorafenib inhibited the phosphorylation of mek
and erk and down-regulated  xxxg366xxx  levels in these two cell
lines. sorafenib also reduced the phosphorylation level of  xxxg692xxx 
and down-regulated the antiapoptotic protein  xxxg1388xxx  in a mek/
erk–independent manner. consistent with the effects on both
mek/erk–dependent and mek/erk–independent signaling
pathways, sorafenib inhibited proliferation and induced apoptosis in both hcc cell lines. in the plc/prf/5 xenograft
model, sorafenib tosylate dosed  xxxd1891xxx  mg/kg inhibited tumor
growth by 49%. at 30 mg/kg, sorafenib tosylate produced
complete tumor growth inhibition. a dose of 100 mg/kg
produced partial tumor regressions in 50% of the mice. in
mechanism of action studies, sorafenib inhibited the phosphorylation of both erk and  xxxg692xxx , reduced the microvessel
area (assessed by cd34 immunohistochemistry), and induced
tumor cell apoptosis (assessed by terminal deoxynucleotidyl
transferase–mediated nick end labeling) in plc/prf/5 tumor
xenografts. these results suggest that the antitumor activity of
sorafenib in hcc models may be attributed to inhibition of
tumor angiogenesis ( xxxg800xxx   xxxg802xxx   xxxg1274xxx  and  xxxg1709xxx   xxxg1710xxx ) and direct effects
on tumor cell proliferation/survival ( xxxg1924xxx  signalingdependent and signaling-independent mechanisms). (cancer

introduction
hepatocellular carcinoma (hcc) is the fifth most common
cancer in the world and is responsible for >600,000 deaths annually
(1). the majority of patients with hcc die within 1 year after the
diagnosis of their disease. unfortunately, the disease is often

diagnosed at a late stage when potentially curative therapies are
least effective. for these patients, medical treatments, including
chemotherapy, chemoembolization, ablation, and proton beam
therapy, remain disappointing. most patients show disease
recurrence that rapidly progresses to the advanced stages with
vascular invasion and multiple intrahepatic metastases and their
5-year relative survival rate is only 7% (2). the prognosis for hcc
patients who have surgically resectable localized tumors is better,
but they still have only a 15% to 39% 5-year survival rate (3). clearly,
there is an urgent need for new therapies for this aggressive
disease.
both angiogenesis and signaling through the raf/mitogenactivated protein (map)/extracellular signal-regulated kinase
(erk) kinase (mek)/erk (raf/mek/erk) cascade play critical
roles in the development of hcc. antiangiogenesis therapies,
which inhibit blood vessel formation, may hold promise in the
treatment of hcc, because hcc tumors depend on a rich blood
supply (4). in addition to being highly angiogenic, human hcc
tumors have high expression and enhanced activity of map kinase
(mapk) compared with adjacent nonneoplastic liver (5). furthermore, treatment of hcc cells with a mek inhibitor reduced cell
proliferation and induced apoptosis (6) and overexpression of
activated  xxxg1361xxx  in hepg2 cells enhanced tumor growth in vivo (7).
therefore, inhibition of both angiogenesis and raf/mek/erk
signaling may represent an attractive approach for the treatment
of hcc.
sorafenib (nexavar,  xxxd3226xxx ) is a multikinase inhibitor that
has shown efficacy against a wide variety of tumors in preclinical
models (8). it has been shown to block tumor cell proliferation and
angiogenesis by inhibiting serine/threonine kinases (c-raf, and
mutant and wild-type braf) as well as the receptor tyrosine
kinases  xxxg2413xxx  receptor 2 ( xxxg1274xxx ),
 xxxg802xxx , platelet-derived growth factor receptor ( xxxg1709xxx   xxxg1710xxx ),  xxxg801xxx ,
ret, and c- xxxg1279xxx  (8, 9). it has also been reported that sorafenib
induces apoptosis in human leukemia cells (10) and other human
tumor cell lines (11) through the inhibition of the translation and
down-regulation of myeloid cell leukemia-1 ( xxxg1388xxx ), a bcl-2 family
member. a recent report by rahmani et al. (10) showed that the
inhibition of  xxxg692xxx  phosphorylation by sorafenib in leukemia cells
was independent of its activity on the mek/erk pathway and
suggests a possible linkage between  xxxg692xxx  and translational control
of  xxxg1388xxx . the purpose of the studies reported here was to build an
understanding of the mechanism of action of sorafenib in
preclinical models of hcc. direct effects of sorafenib on hcc
tumor cells were evaluated in vitro in plc/prf/5 (p53-mutant, kras-mutant, and b-raf wild type) and hepg2 (p53 wild type, k-rasmutant, and b-raf wild type) hcc cell lines. the antitumor efficacy
and mechanism of action of sorafenib were also characterized
in vivo using the plc/prf/5 hcc tumor xenograft model.

sunnyvale, ca).
characterization of apoptosis morphology in cells. cells were plated
in 96-well plates at 3,000 cells per well. after compound treatment, cells
were fixed using 10% buffered formalin/4% formaldehyde. cellular dna
fragmentation morphology was detected by terminal deoxynucleotidyl
transferase (tdt)–mediated nick end labeling (tunel) staining using
apoptag red in situ  xxxg1279xxx  (chemicon international, inc., temecula, ca)
according to the manufacturer’s directions. dna nuclear morphology was
examined with  xxxd2284xxx  dye (0.1 ag/ml) staining in fixed cells. both
tunel-positive cells and nuclear morphology phenotype were visualized
and analyzed using cellomic arrayscan ii image analysis system (cellomics,
inc., pittsburgh, pa).
flow cytometry cell cycle analysis. cells were plated in six-well plates
at 3  105 per well. after compound treatment, cells were harvested by
trypsinization and washed with pbs. cells were fixed in ice-cold 80%
ethanol, washed, and resuspended in 1 ml pbs; treated with 10 al  xxxg1963xxx 
(21 mg/ml); and stained with 5 al  xxxd3027xxx  iodide at 1 mg/ml for 30
minutes at room temperature. the stained cells were analyzed by flow
cytometry (bd lsrii system, bd biosciences, san jose, ca) and dna
content was quantified using modfit software (verity software house, inc.,
topsham, me).
immunoblot analysis. cells were plated at 250,000 to 500,000 per well in
six-well plates (falcon multiwell, becton dickinson, franklin lakes, nj). the
following day, cells were treated with compounds in rpmi medium
containing 10% fbs or 0.1% bsa for the times indicated in the experiment.
after treatment, cells were washed with cold pbs and lysed in the culture
dishes using cell lysis buffer [40 mmol/l tris-hcl (ph 7.4), 10% glycerol,
50 mmol/l bgp, 5 mmol/l egta, 2 mmol/l edta, 0.35 mmol/l vanadate,

on 4% to 12% gradient nupage gels (novex, inc., san diego, ca),
electrophoresed under reducing conditions, and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes (0.45 am; bio-rad laboratories). blots were probed with
anti-phospho-erk (thr202/tyr204, cell signaling technology inc., beverly,
ma), anti-phospho-mek (ser217/221, cell signaling technology), antiphospho- xxxg692xxx  (ser209, cell signaling technology), anti-phospho-akt

horseradish peroxidase (hrp)–conjugated secondary antibodies (1:5,000),
and then blots were developed with enhanced chemiluminescence reagent
(amersham, piscataway, nj) on amersham hyperfilm.
tumor xenograft experiments. cb17 severe combined immunodeficient (scid) female mice (taconic farms, germantown, ny) were used for
all in vivo studies. the mice were housed and maintained within the
comparative medicine department at bayer corporation, in accordance
with bayer institutional animal care and use committee, state, and federal
guidelines for the humane treatment and care of laboratory animals. mice
received food and water ad libitum.
tumors were generated by harvesting plc/prf/5 cells from mid-log
phase cultures using trypsin-edta (life technologies). cells were then
pelleted and resuspended in a 50% mixture of matrigel (bd biosciences) in
hbss (life technologies) to a final cell count of 2.5  107/ml. a volume of
0.2 ml of the cell suspension was injected s.c. in the right flank of each
mouse. sorafenib tosylate was used for all in vivo experiments. cremophor
el/95% ethanol (50:50; sigma) was stored in the dark at room temperature.
sorafenib tosylate was formulated as previously described (8). sorafenib
tosylate was administered p.o., once daily for 16 or 21 days at dose levels of
10, 30, and 100 mg/kg body weight starting when all animals in the study
had established tumors averaging from 140 to 160 mg with 10 mice per
group.
tumor dimensions and body weights were recorded twice weekly
starting with the first day of treatment. treatments producing >20%
lethality and/or 20% net body weight loss were considered ‘‘toxic’’. tumor

figure 3. sorafenib down-regulates  xxxg366xxx  in hcc cells. plc/prf/5 (a) and
hepg2 (b ) cells were treated with compound for 5 or 16 hours in rpmi 1640
containing 10% fbs. after treatment, cells were lysed and 20 ag of soluble
protein were separated by electrophoresis on a sds-page gel. protein levels
were detected by western blot analysis. glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate
dehydrogenase ( xxxg861xxx  ) or h-actin was used as a loading control.

weights were calculated using the equation (l  w 2) / 2, where l and w refer
to the larger and smaller dimensions collected at each measurement.
antitumor efficacy was measured as the incidence of complete regressions
(cr), partial regressions (pr), and tumor growth inhibition (tgi). crs are
defined as tumors that are reduced to below the limit of palpation. prs are
defined as tumors that are reduced by >50% but are <100% of their initial
size. a minimum duration of 5 days is required for a cr or pr to be
considered durable. tgi is defined as [1 (t/c)  100], where t and c are
the mean tumor weight in the treated and untreated control groups,
respectively, at the first measurement after the end of treatment. tumor
volume data were statistically analyzed with one-way anova, and
individual group comparisons were evaluated by bonferroni’s multiple
comparison test. p values <0.05 were considered significant.
mechanism of action studies and immunohistochemical staining
and quantification. female scid mice with tumors measuring 200 to
300 mg in size received sorafenib tosylate p.o. once daily for 5 days at dose
levels of 30 and 100 mg/kg. tumors were harvested 3 hours after the last
treatment. tumors were either homogenized in tumor lysis buffer for
western blot analysis or fixed in paraformaldehyde for 24 hours, and
paraffin sections were used for immunohistochemical staining. immuno-

histochemical staining of paraffin sections of tumors was done with rat
monoclonal anti-cd34 antibody (abcam, cambridge, ma) at a dilution of
1:50 (2 ag/ml) made in rabbit serum and rabbit monoclonal anti-phosphoerk1/2 antibody (phospho- xxxd1355xxx /42 mapk, thr202/tyr204; cell signaling
technology) at a dilution of 1:60 made in antibody diluent (dakocytomation, fort collins, co). staining was done using the envision plus hrp (3,3¶diaminobenzidine) system from dako (carpinteria, ca) according to the
manufacturer’s protocol. the slides were counterstained with mayer’s
hematoxylin for 1 minute and washed with water. tunel staining for
mouse tumor tissue was based on the protocol of the tdt-fragel dna
fragmentation detection  xxxg1279xxx  (calbiochem).
the tissue sections were viewed at 100 magnification and images were
captured with a digital camera (diagnostic instruments, inc., sterling
heights, mi). four fields per section were analyzed, excluding peripheral
connective tissue and necrotic regions. total tissue area analyzed in each
section was 2.576 mm2. areas of cd34- or tunel-positive objects were
quantified using imagepro plus version 3.0 (media cybernetics, silver
spring, md). percentage of microvessel area (mva) in each field was
calculated as [(area of cd34-positive objects / measured tissue area)  100].
percentage of tunel-positive staining in each field was calculated as [(area
of tunel-positive objects / measured tissue area)  100]. mean values of
mva- or tunel-positive area in each group were calculated from five
tumor samples. data were analyzed statistically with one-way anova
followed by fisher’s probable least-squares difference (statview, version 4.5;
abacus concepts, inc., berkeley, ca), where p < 0.05 was considered
significant.

results
sorafenib inhibits proliferation and induces apoptosis in
hcc cell lines. the effect of sorafenib on cell proliferation was
measured by celltiter-glo (72 hours) assay and on apoptosis by
using dna fragmentation (48 hours) assays. sorafenib inhibited cell
proliferation dose-dependently with an ic50 of 6.3 amol/l in plc/
prf/5 and 4.5 amol/l in hepg2 cells (fig. 1a). furthermore,
sorafenib induced dna fragmentation in both hcc cell lines in the
presence of 10% fbs (plc/prf/5, ec50 = 7.7 amol/l; hepg2,
ec50 = 2.4 amol/l) with no significant difference when done in the
absence of serum (fig. 1b).
induction of apoptosis by sorafenib was further evaluated by
tunel staining and by characterizing changes in nuclear morphology. sorafenib increased tunel staining in a dose-dependent
manner (fig. 1c) in both hcc cell lines. sorafenib (15 amol/l)
increased the percentage of tunel-positive cells from 1.8% and
1.2%, as seen in the controls, to 16.4% and 12.0% as seen in the
treated plc/prf/5 and hepg2 cells, respectively. pretreatment of

sorafenib preclinical antitumor effect in hcc

cells with a pan-caspase inhibitor, zvad-fmk, did not block
sorafenib-induced apoptosis as measured by an increase in tunel
staining in plc/prf/5 cells. however, it decreased sorafenibinduced tunel staining f30% in hepg2 cells. furthermore, both
nuclear condensation and nuclear fragmentation (14), hallmarks of
apoptosis, were detected using hoechst staining of cells in both hcc
cell lines after sorafenib treatment when measured at 48 hours of
treatment. after treatment of plc/prf/5 cells with sorafenib, the
majority of apoptotic cells displayed nuclear condensation and
fragmentation (fig. 1d). in contrast, the most prominent type of
nuclear morphology present in sorafenib-treated hepg2 cells was
nuclear condensation with little fragmentation observed (fig. 1d).
pretreatment of cells with zvad-fmk had no significant effect on the
nuclear morphologic changes induced by sorafenib in either hcc
cell lines (fig. 1d).
cell cycle analysis by flow cytometry showed a decrease of g1
and increase of s phase after sorafenib treatment for 24 hours in
hepg2 cells, with less effects on cell cycle distribution observed in
plc/prf/5 cells (fig. 1e). dose-dependent increases in the ‘‘subg0’’ population, indicative of late-apoptotic or dead cells, were
observed in both plc/prf/5 and hepg2 cells after treatment of
sorafenib for 24 hours (fig. 1e).
sorafenib inhibits raf/mek/erk signaling pathway in hcc
cell lines. raf kinases are best known as key regulators of the mek/
erk cascade, and up-regulated signaling through the raf/mek/
erk pathway has an important role in hcc. changes in the phosphorylation levels of key proteins in the raf/mek/erk pathway
were determined by western blot analysis to evaluate the effect of
sorafenib on this pathway in plc/prf/5 and hepg2 tumor cells. in
both nonstimulated cells and  xxxg1044xxx –stimulated
cells, sorafenib inhibited mek and erk phosphorylation at a
concentration of between 3 and 10 amol/l in plc/prf/5 cells
(fig. 2a) and between 1 and 3 amol/l in hepg2 cells (fig. 2b). the
selective mek inhibitor  xxxd3462xxx , used as a control, inhibited erk
phosphorylation at 1 amol/l while increasing the level of phosphomek, which is consistent with the induction of a feedback loop
upon the inhibition of phospho-erk and mapk signaling in these
cells. total mek, erk, and akt levels were unchanged, and no
changes were observed in the phosphorylation levels of akt.
the level of  xxxg366xxx , which is involved in cell proliferation and
is activated by both the raf/mek/erk and phosphatidylinositol
3-kinase pathways in tumor cells (15, 16), was measured after 5 and
16 hours of sorafenib treatment to further characterize the effects
of sorafenib on cell proliferation. at a concentration of 10 amol/l,
sorafenib reduced  xxxg366xxx  protein level in both plc/prf/5 and
hepg2 cells (fig. 3). this seems to be a mek/erk–dependent
effect as the selective mek inhibitor  xxxd3462xxx  also reduced  xxxg366xxx 
level in hepg2 cells.
the above data showed that sorafenib inhibited mek and erk
phosphorylation and down-regulated  xxxg366xxx  in both plc/prf/5
and hepg2 cells in vitro, consistent with the known inhibitory
activity of sorafenib against  xxxg1924xxx  isoforms.
sorafenib reduces phosphorylation of  xxxg692xxx  and downregulates  xxxg1388xxx  levels in hcc cells, independent of mek/erk
signaling.  xxxg1388xxx , an antiapoptotic member of the bcl-2 family, has
been shown to be an important factor for apoptosis resistance in
hcc (17, 18). sorafenib has been reported to induce apoptosis in
human leukemia cells and other human tumor cell lines through
the inhibition of translation and down-regulation of  xxxg1388xxx  (9, 10).
 xxxg1388xxx  protein levels and the phosphorylation state of  xxxg692xxx  were
determined to understand if  xxxg1388xxx  could play a role in the

figure 5. sorafenib produces robust efficacy against plc/prf/5 hcc tumors
in mice. plc/prf/5 tumors cells (5  106 per animal) were implanted s.c. in the
flank of athymic mice as described in materials and methods in two independent
experiments. treatment was initiated on day 11 or 12 when all groups had
tumors averaging 140 to 160 mg in size. sorafenib tosylate was administered

mechanism of sorafenib-induced apoptosis in hcc cells. sorafenib
reduced the level of phospho- xxxg692xxx  after 2 hours of treatment at
concentrations of 1 and 10 amol/l (fig. 4) in both hcc cell lines.
 xxxg1388xxx  protein levels were also reduced after 16 hours  xxxd1891xxx  amol/l
(fig. 4) in both hcc cell lines. the mek inhibitor  xxxd3462xxx  had no
effect on the level of  xxxg692xxx  phosphorylation or  xxxg1388xxx  levels in
hepg2 cells under the same conditions (fig. 4). these data suggest
that sorafenib reduces the phosphorylation of  xxxg692xxx  and downregulates  xxxg1388xxx  independent of its effects on mek/erk signaling.
in vivo efficacy and mechanism of action of sorafenib
against plc/prf/5 human hcc tumor xenografts. sorafenib
tosylate produced dose-dependent growth inhibition of s.c.
implanted plc/prf/5 tumor xenografts in scid mice as shown
in fig. 5 and table 1. dose levels of 10 and 30 mg/kg produced
significant and dose-dependent tgis of 49% and 78%, respectively
(p < 0.001; fig. 5a). the effect at 30 mg/kg sorafenib tosylate was
confirmed in an independent experiment (p < 0.001) and the dose
response was further evaluated at a dose level of 100 mg/kg
(fig. 5b). sorafenib tosylate produced durable partial tumor
regressions in 50% of the mice at the 100 mg/kg dose level. it is

worth noting that establishment of s.c. plc/prf/5 tumors in scid
mice required implantation in a matrigel matrix. therefore, it is not
possible to achieve complete tumor regressions in this model
because the matrigel would persist even if the tumor cells were
completely eliminated. there was progressive moderate weight loss
(6–17% of initial body weight) in the untreated and vehicle-treated
control groups in these experiments. weight loss was similar in the
sorafenib-treated groups independent of the dose level, suggesting
that weight loss was associated with tumor growth and not with
drug treatment. these observations indicate that sorafenib was
well tolerated and highly efficacious against this human hcc
xenograft model.
the effects of sorafenib on angiogenesis and signaling through
the raf/mek/erk cascade, and on induction of apoptosis in plc/
prf/5 mouse xenografts, were assessed in a separate experiment.
plc/prf/5 xenograft tumors were generated as described
previously. however, for this experiment, treatment was administered once daily for only 5 days, rather than for 16 or 21 days, and
was not initiated until tumors were 200 to 300 mg in size. larger
tumors were required for this experiment so that when they were
collected 3 hours after the last treatment, they could be bisected.
half of each tumor was formalin fixed for 24 hours and then
analyzed by immunohistochemistry. the other half of each tumor
was homogenized to generate lysates for western blot analysis.
cd34 is a specific endothelial cell marker and has been commonly
used for microvessel quantification in hcc (19). sorafenib tosylate
at dose levels of 30 and 100 mg/kg significantly (p < 0.001) reduced
tumor mva in plc/prf/5 xenografts, as assessed by cd34 staining
(fig. 6a). figure 6a also shows that sorafenib reduced erk
phosphorylation and induced tumor cell apoptosis, as measured by
tunel staining, at both dose levels evaluated. the reduction in
cd34 and increase in tunel-positive staining is quantified in the
graphs shown in fig. 6c. cd34 staining was reduced from 0.51% in
the vehicle-treated tumors to 0.14% and 0.13% mva in tumors
treated with 30 or 100 mg/kg sorafenib, respectively. tunel
staining in the same samples was increased from 0.07% positive
area in the vehicle-treated tumors to 4.9% and 6.6% positive area in
tumors treated with 30 or 100 mg/kg sorafenib, respectively. tumor
extracts from vehicle and sorafenib-treated groups were analyzed
by western blotting for phosphorylation levels of  xxxg692xxx . a dosedependent reduction in p- xxxg692xxx  was observed in the tumor lysates

from the animals treated with 30 and 100 mg/kg sorafenib (fig. 6b).
the observation that sorafenib reduced phospho-erk and
phospho- xxxg692xxx  levels and induced apoptosis in plc/prf/5
xenograft tumors is consistent with a direct effect of sorafenib on
hcc tumor cell apoptosis in addition to its pronounced
antivascular effect on tumor microvessel content.

discussion
sorafenib is a multikinase inhibitor with activity against the ser/
thr kinase raf, which is known to be important in tumor cell
signaling and tumor cell proliferation, and several receptor tyrosine
kinases involved in angiogenesis, including  xxxg1274xxx  and  xxxg1709xxx   xxxg1710xxx .
this multikinase inhibitor was recently approved for the treatment
of advanced renal cell cancer based on the positive results of a large
phase iii randomized clinical trial and is currently under
evaluation in phase iii trials for malignant melanoma and hcc.
in this report, we show in two human hcc cell lines that sorafenib
blocks  xxxg1924xxx  signaling, inhibits tumor cell proliferation, and
induces apoptosis in vitro. in addition, sorafenib exhibits robust
antitumor efficacy, including partial tumor regressions in plc/
prf/5 hcc xenografts. the in vivo antitumor activity of sorafenib
correlated with the inhibition of mapk signaling, which is
indicative of  xxxg1924xxx  inhibition; induction of apoptosis as
measured by tunel staining; and inhibition of tumor mva (tumor
angiogenesis) as measured by the reduction in cd34 staining.
these results provide evidence that sorafenib may be an attractive
approach for the treatment of hcc by simultaneously inhibiting
both tumor angiogenesis (vegf and pdgf signaling) and tumor
cell survival ( xxxg1924xxx  signaling-dependent and signalingindependent mechanisms).
unlike other tumor types, most notably malignant melanoma,
braf-activating mutations are relatively rare events in hcc
(20, 21). however,  xxxg1924xxx  is overexpressed in a high percentage
of hcc patient tumors, and the raf/mek/erk pathway can be
activated by major etiologic factors such as hbv and hcv infection
and mitogenic growth factors (21, 22). the data obtained in the
present study indicate that sorafenib is able to inhibit  xxxg1924xxx 
and thus block mek/erk signaling in both plc/prf/5 and hepg2
cells. like  xxxd3462xxx , a selective mek inhibitor, sorafenib reduced cyclin
d1 level and inhibited cell proliferation in these two cell lines.

sorafenib preclinical antitumor effect in hcc

figure 6. in vivo mechanism of action of sorafenib
in plc/prf/5 hcc tumors. sorafenib tosylate was
administered once daily for 5 days at the indicated dose
levels to female scid mice with tumors measuring 200 to
300 mg in size. tumors were collected 3 hours after the
last treatment. tumors were either homogenized for
analysis by western blot or formalin fixed for 24 hours
and then analyzed by immunohistochemistry (ihc ).
a, sorafenib reduces the microvessel density,
as measured by cd34 staining; the amount of
phosphorylation of erk, as measured by phosphospecific
antibodies to phospho-erk (p-erk ); and induces
apoptosis, as measured by the increase in staining of
tunel-positive area in plc/prf/5 tumors in mice.
b, sorafenib reduces the phosphorylation level of  xxxg692xxx  in
plc/prf/5 hcc tumors in mice. c, quantification of

*, p < 0.05, treated group versus vehicle group by one-way
anova dunnet’s multiple comparison test.

in addition to the inhibition of proliferation, sorafenib also
induced apoptosis as measured by the increase in dna fragmentation, tunel staining, nuclear fragmentation, and condensation
in both plc/prf/5 and hepg2 cells. sorafenib-induced apoptosis
as assessed by tunel staining and nuclear morphology was not
inhibited by a pan-caspase inhibitor, zvad-fmk, in plc/prf/5 cells
(fig. 1c and d) and only partially inhibited by zvad-fmk in hepg2
cells using tunel staining (fig. 1c). we also observed that
sorafenib-induced caspase-3 activation was detected in hepg2 cells
but not in plc/prf/5 cells (data not shown). this suggests that
sorafenib-induced apoptosis may not be dependent on caspases in
plc/prf/5 cells. the induction of apoptosis by sorafenib through
both caspase-dependent and caspase-independent pathways has
been reported previously by panka et al. (23) and although sorafenib
induces apoptosis via different pathways in hepg2 and plc/prf/5
cells, both cell lines are equally sensitive to the compound in vitro.

although the effects of sorafenib on caspase activation and cell
cycle regulation differ between the hcc cell lines, sorafenib downregulated the antiapoptotic protein  xxxg1388xxx  and reduced  xxxg692xxx 
phosphorylation in both lines. these effects were similar to those
reported previously by yu, rahmani, and colleagues (10, 11) in
other tumor cell lines. the down-regulation of  xxxg1388xxx  and  xxxg692xxx 
phosphorylation were not seen with the mek inhibitor  xxxd3462xxx  in
hepg2 cells, suggesting that these effects are not mediated through
the mek/erk pathway. genetic evidence suggests that  xxxg1924xxx  may
regulate apoptosis in a manner independent of its kinase activity
and ability to signal through the mek/erk pathway (24–26). raf
kinase is a member of a large protein complex that includes 14-3-3,
 xxxg1723xxx , ksr, cnk, spred, and surb proteins (27, 28). it also regulates
the activity of ask1,  xxxg242xxx , mst2, and nuclear factor-nb in a
kinase-independent manner (26, 28–30). the mechanism underlying sorafenib-induced reduction of  xxxg692xxx  phosphorylation and

 xxxg1388xxx  down-regulation remains to be elucidated but may involve
regulation of translational control of  xxxg1388xxx  by an  xxxg692xxx -dependent
mechanism (10).
sorafenib has previously been reported to inhibit the growth of a
wide variety of human tumor xenografts in mice (8). the antitumor
effect of sorafenib can best be characterized as disease stabilization, and in many of these tumor models, it has been difficult to
measure the relative contributions of the antiangiogenic activity of
sorafenib versus its direct antitumor activity (8). in the current
study, sorafenib significantly inhibited angiogenesis, phosphorylation levels of erk and  xxxg692xxx , and induced cell death after only
5 days of treatment in plc/prf/5 tumors. this sorafenib-induced
tumor apoptosis resulted in tumor shrinkage that develops slowly
and progressively in this model and reached the level of objective
regression after 10 days of dosing. these results suggest that both
the antiangiogenic activity and the inhibition of the tumor cell
signaling activity through  xxxg1924xxx –dependent and  xxxg1924xxx –
independent pathways, including apoptosis induction, may contribute to the tumor regression observed in the plc/prf/5 tumor
mice treated with sorafenib. additional studies would be needed to
assess the efficacy of sorafenib against hcc tumors grown
orthotopically. therefore, these data support the ongoing phase

iii clinical trials to assess the antitumor efficacy of sorafenib in
hcc patients.
in summary, this study shows that sorafenib inhibits the raf/
mek/erk pathway both in vitro and in vivo, inhibits tumor
angiogenesis, induces tumor cell apoptosis in vivo, and is
efficacious against a model of human hcc in scid mice. the
inhibition of the raf/mek/erk signaling pathway, the reduction
of  xxxg692xxx  phosphorylation, and the down-regulation of  xxxg1388xxx 
protein levels may contribute to the proapoptotic effects of
sorafenib in hcc tumors in addition to its pronounced antivascular effects. these observations may provide potentially useful
biomarkers of sorafenib activity for the ongoing hcc clinical trials
and/or rationale to combine with other chemotherapeutic agents.
