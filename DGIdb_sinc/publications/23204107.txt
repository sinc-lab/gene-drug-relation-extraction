background—cxc- xxxg565xxx  4 (cxcr4) regulates the retention of stem/progenitor cells in the bone marrow
(bm), and the cxcr4 antagonist amd3100 improves recovery from coronary ligation injury by mobilizing stem/
progenitor cells from the bm to the peripheral blood. thus, we investigated whether amd3100 also improves recovery
from ischemia/reperfusion injury, which more closely mimics myocardial infarction in patients, because blood flow is
only temporarily obstructed.
methods and results—mice were treated with single subcutaneous injections of amd3100 (5 mg/kg) or saline after
ischemia/reperfusion injury. three days later, histological measurements of the ratio of infarct area to area at risk
were smaller in amd3100-treated mice than in mice administered saline, and echocardiographic measurements of left
ventricular function were greater in the amd3100-treated mice at week 4. cxcr4+ cells were mobilized for just 1 day in
both groups, but the mobilization of sca1+/ xxxg1274xxx + cells endured for 7 days in amd3100-treated mice compared with just 1
day in the saline-treated mice. amd3100 upregulated bm levels of endothelial  xxxd2738xxx  synthase (enos) and 2 targets
of enos signaling,  xxxg1440xxx  and soluble kit ligand. furthermore, the loss of bm enos expression
abolished the benefit of amd3100 on sca1+/ xxxg1274xxx + cell mobilization without altering the mobilization of cxcr4+ cells,
and the cardioprotective effects of amd3100 were retained in enos-knockout mice that had been transplanted with bm
from wild-type mice but not in wild-type mice with enos-knockout bm.
conclusions—amd3100 prolongs bm progenitor mobilization and improves recovery from ischemia/reperfusion injury,
and these benefits appear to occur through a previously unidentified link between amd3100 and bm enos expression.

n response to ischemic myocardial injury, stem/progenitor
cells are mobilized from the bone marrow (bm) to the
peripheral blood (pb) and become incorporated into the
injured tissue, where a subset of the mobilized cells, including
endothelial progenitor cells (epcs), contribute to cardiac
recovery by enhancing vessel growth.1–3 before mobilization,
progenitor cells are sequestered in the bm by interactions
between cxc  xxxg565xxx  4 (cxcr4) and stromalcell–derived factor 1 (sdf-1).4,5 mobilization is triggered
when this interaction is disrupted, and sdf-1 expression in the
ischemic tissue contributes to the recruitment and incorporation

of mobilized epcs.6 sdf-1 also induces the migration of epcs
in vitro,7 and sdf-1–cxcr4 signaling appears to influence
epc proliferation and survival.8,9 thus, the sdf-1/cxcr4
axis is a key regulator of the activity of stem/progenitor cells,
including epcs, particularly the release from bm and the
retention/recruitment of progenitors in/to ischemic tissue.

amd3100, a pharmacological cxcr4 antagonist.10–12 in
early pharmacokinetic studies, a single intravenous dose of
amd3100 unexpectedly increased circulating white blood
cell counts in healthy volunteers,13 and subsequent reports
indicate that amd3100 rapidly mobilizes hematopoietic progenitor cells in both humans and mice by reversibly blocking the sdf-1–cxcr4 interaction.13–16 previously, we have
shown that a single dose of amd3100 after surgical ligation
of the coronary artery17 increases the mobilization of bm
progenitor cells (bmpcs), which leads to a greater bmpc
accumulation in infarcted tissue and to improvements in
vascularity and myocardial performance; furthermore, the
effect of amd3100 on bmpc mobilization endured for >1
week. this is somewhat surprising because the half-life of
amd3100 in serum is just 2 to 3 hours and consequently
the short-term activity of amd3100 as a cxcr4 antagonist
should dissipate within a day of administration. here, we
investigated whether amd3100 also improves myocardial
recovery after ischemia/reperfusion (ir) injury, which more
closely resembles the clinical presentation of acute myocardial infarction, because blood flow is obstructed temporarily
rather than permanently. we also compared the time course
and signaling pathways involved in bmpc mobilization and
those associated with mobilization of cxcr4+ mononuclear
cells (mncs).

methods
injury model and treatment
all mice were obtained from the jackson laboratories. bm transplantation surgery and ir injury were performed as described previously18–20 and as summarized in the online-only data supplement.
mice received a single subcutaneous injection of amd3100
(5 mg/kg, 125 mug in 100 mul; sigma-aldrich) or an equal volume of
saline immediately after surgery was complete. area at risk (aar)
and infarct area were measured as described in the online-only
data supplement. aar was presented as a percentage of the area
of the entire left ventricle (lv); the infarct area, as a percentage of
the aar.

physiological assessments of lv function
echocardiographic measurements were performed with a commercially available high-resolution echocardiographic system (vevo
770, visualsonics inc). end-systolic and end-diastolic lv areas on
the short-axis view were traced at the midpapillary muscle level
according to the instruction of the echocardiographic program, and
the following calculation was used for area fractional shortening
(fs%): (diastolic lv area−systolic lv area)/diastolic lv area.

detailed information, including primer and probe sequences (table
i), is provided in the online-only data supplement.

statistical analysis
all values were expressed as mean±sem. comparisons among
samples from different mice at single or multiple time points were
evaluated by unpaired t test (bar graph). comparisons among consecutive samples from identified mouse in a single group were
evaluated by 1-way anova with the bonferroni post hoc test (line
graph). comparisons among consecutive samples from identified
mouse in multiple groups were evaluated by 2-way anova with
the bonferroni post hoc test (line graph; the factors are the groups
and time). we applied the bonferroni adjustment to both comparisons of the groups within each time point and comparisons of each
time point and baseline within each group only when the data were
collected from identical mouse at multiple time points. a 2-sided
value of p<0.05 was considered statistically significant.

results
the in vivo experiments for histological and echocardiographic analyses were performed separately. therefore, the
difference in sample sizes for each group is due to different
series of experiments.

amd3100 treatment reduces infarct size and
improves cardiac performance after ir injury
ir injury was induced by surgically occluding the left anterior descending artery for 60 minutes, and amd3100 (125
mug in 100 mul) or an equal volume of saline was injected
subcutaneously immediately after surgery was complete.
infarct size and the aar for infarction were evaluated 3
days after ir injury by briefly reoccluding the left anterior
descending artery, perfusing the hearts with microspheres,
and then staining sections of heart tissue with triphenyltetrazolium chloride (figure 1a). viable tissue was stained
deep red; the infarcted region remained colorless; and the
aar was identified by the absence of microspheres. the
size of the aar was similar in both treatment groups
(figure 1b), but the infarcted regions were significantly
smaller in amd3100-treated mice than in mice administered saline (figure 1c). amd3100 treatment was also
associated with significantly less apoptosis on day 3 (figure
1d) and with significantly less fibrosis on day 28 (figure
1e) after ir injury.
cardiac function was measured before ir injury and 7, 14,
and 28 days afterward via echocardiographic assessments
of lv fractional shortening, lv systolic area, and lv
diastolic area. fractional shortening was significantly
greater and lv systolic area was significantly smaller in
mice administered amd3100 than in saline-treated mice
on days 14 and 28 after ir injury, whereas lv diastolic
area did not differ significantly between groups at any time
point (figure 1f–1h and tables ii and iii in the onlineonly data supplement). collectively, the results from these

histological and echocardiographic assessments suggest that
a single injection of amd3100 after ir injury improves
cardiac performance by enhancing the preservation and/or
recovery of functional myocardial tissue.

amd3100 preferentially enhances the mobilization
of bm cells after ir injury
because amd3100 is a cxcr4 antagonist and has been shown
to enhance the mobilization of stem/progenitor cells from bm
to pb after permanent ligation of the coronary artery,17 we
investigated whether amd3100 treatment enhanced the mobilization of mncs, cxcr4+ mncs, and sca1+/ xxxg1274xxx + mncs in
both uninjured mice and mice with ir injury. pb levels of
the 3 types of cells were measured via fluorescence-activated
cell sorting, and fluorescence-activated cell sorting measurements of sca1+/ xxxg1274xxx + mnc levels were corroborated via the
epc culture assay.  xxxg2259xxx + bm progenitor mobilization was
also evaluated by monitoring green fluorescent protein (gfp)
expression in the bm of wild-type (wt) mice transplanted
with bm from  xxxg2259xxx -gfp transgenic mice, which express gfp
from the endothelium-specific  xxxg2259xxx  promoter.

in the absence of injury, fluorescence-activated cell sorting
analyses indicated that pb levels of mncs, including sca1+/
 xxxg1274xxx + subpopulation, tended to increase (figure 2a and c)
and cxcr4+ mncs significantly increased after amd3100
treatment (figure 2b). the time course of mobilization in the
3 cell types was almost similar: cell counts tended to peak
within 3 hours after amd3100 administration and returned
to near pretreatment levels by 24 hours (figure 2a–2c).
after ir injury, amd3100 treatment did not alter pb mnc
levels (figure 2d), but pb cxcr4+ mnc counts (figure 2e)
and sca1+/ xxxg1274xxx + mnc counts (figure 2f) were significantly
higher 1 and 3 days, respectively, after injury in amd3100treated mice than in mice administered saline. the enhanced
mobilization of cxcr4+ mncs diminished by day 3, whereas
pb sca1+/ xxxg1274xxx + mnc counts remained significantly higher in
the amd3100-treated mice than in the saline-treatment group
through day 7. when evaluated via culture assay, pb epc
levels (ie, the number of cells stained positively for both lectin
and acetylated low-density lipoprotein) were significantly
higher in the amd3100-treated mice than in the salinetreated mice on days 3 and 7 after ir injury (figure i in the

figure 2. amd3100 enhances the mobilization of circulating cxc-chemokine
receptor 4–positive (cxcr4+) mononuclear
cells (mncs) and sca1+/ xxxg1274xxx + cells after
ischemia/reperfusion (ir) injury. a through
c, peripheral blood (pb) levels of (a)
mncs, (b) cxcr4+ mncs, and (c) sca1+/
 xxxg1274xxx + cells were determined in uninjured
mice before injection of amd3100 (125 mug

mncs, (e) cxcr4+ mncs, and (f) sca1+/
 xxxg1274xxx + cells were determined in mice before
ir injury and treatment with amd3100 or
saline and from 1 to 28 days afterward.
mnc levels were measured with a hemavet hematology system, and the levels of
cxcr4+ mncs and sca1+/ xxxg1274xxx + cells were
measured via fluorescence-activated cell
sorter analyses of mncs labeled with
fluorescent cxcr4 antibodies (cxcr4+
mncs) or double-labeled with fluorescent
sca1 antibodies and  xxxg1274xxx  antibodies. g, ir

online-only data supplement), and in mice with  xxxg2259xxx -gfp bm,
gfp-expressing cells were significantly less common in
bm from the amd3100-treated group than in bm from
saline-treated animals on day 5 after ir injury (figure 2g).
thus, amd3100 appears to rapidly but briefly enhance the
mobilization of cxcr4+ mncs after ir injury, which is
consistent with the role of amd3100 as a cxcr4 antagonist.
however, the effect of amd3100 on sca1+/ xxxg1274xxx + mnc
mobilization is delayed, more durable, and consequently
likely mediated by a different mechanism.

amd3100 increases the contribution of
bm-derived progenitors to vascular growth after
ir injury
to determine whether the enhanced bmpc mobilization
observed in mice treated with amd3100 after ir injury

was accompanied by improved vascularity in the aar, the
functional vasculature of injured mice was stained via in
vivo perfusion with  xxxd812xxx -lectin before the mice were killed.
experiments were performed in wt mice transplanted
with bm from enhanced gfp–expressing mice to enable
identification of bm-derived cells in the vasculature.
compared with observations in saline-treated mice, the aar
of amd3100-treated mice contained significantly more gfp+
cells on day 3 after injury (figure 3a and 2b) and significantly
more gfp+ cells, gfp-lectin double-positive cells (figure 3c
and 3d), and lectin+ vessel density (figure 3c and 3e) on day
28. amd3100 treatment also kept elevated sdf-1 expression
levels in aar through day 3 to 7 after ir injury in mice with
wt bm (figure ii in the online-only data supplement),
which likely contributed to the enhanced incorporation of
bm-derived cells, perhaps including epcs.

amd3100 increases bm endothelial  xxxd2738xxx 
synthase expression and the number of endothelial
 xxxd2738xxx  synthase–expressing bm-derived
cells in the aar after ir injury
endothelial  xxxd2738xxx  synthase (enos) is a key regulator of
endothelial cell growth and migration, vascular remodeling,
and angiogenesis21–23 and has recently been shown to have an
important role in the activity of stem and progenitor cells. we
investigated whether the enhanced functional recovery and
bmpc mobilization associated with amd3100 administration after ir injury are accompanied by increases in enos
activity.
from day 1 through day 7 after ir injury, enos-expressing cells were significantly more common in the bm of
amd3100-treated mice than in the bm of mice administered
saline (figure 4a). amd3100 treatment was also associated
with higher bm protein levels of  xxxg1440xxx 
and soluble kit ligand,24 2 downstream components of the
enos pathway, from day 1 and 3, respectively, through day
7 (figure 4b and 4c) and with higher pb levels of nitrate
and nitrite (ie, the final metabolites of  xxxd2738xxx ) on day 3
(figure 4d). in mice transplanted with bm from transgenic
gfp-expressing mice, the number of cells in the aar that
expressed enos, gfp, or both enos and gfp was significantly higher in amd3100-treated mice than in saline-treated
mice on day 3 after injury (figure 4e–4h). thus, amd3100
administration after ir injury appears to increase enos activity in both the bm and the ischemic region.
the direct influence of amd3100 on enos activity was
investigated by determining whether amd3100 treatment
altered enos mrna expression and nitrate/nitrite production in cultured bmpcs or luciferase activity in murine
endothelial cells transfected with a gene coding for luciferase
expression from the enos promoter. amd3100 treatment

was associated with higher levels of both enos expression
and nitrate/nitrite production in bmpcs (figure iiia and iiib
in the online-only data supplement), and amd3100 dosedependently increased luciferase activity in transfected endothelial cells (figure iiic in the online-only data supplement).
collectively, these observations suggest that the benefits associated with amd3100 administration are accompanied by
increases in enos activity.

the benefit of amd3100 treatment after ir injury
is dependent on enos expression in the bm but
not in the ischemic region
to determine whether enos expression contributes to the benefits associated with amd3100 administration after ir injury
and, if so, whether that contribution comes from bm cells or
from cells already present in the ischemic tissue, we evaluated
the influence of amd3100 on myocardial recovery in enosknockout mice that had been transplanted with bm from wt
mice (enos-ko/wtbm) and in wt mice transplanted with
bm from enos-ko mice (wt/enos-kobm). an identical set
of assessments was performed in wt mice transplanted with
wt bm (wt/wtbm).
in enos-ko/wtbm mice, lv fractional shortening on
days 14 and 28 after ir injury was significantly greater with
amd3100 treatment than with saline treatment, but the functional benefit of amd3100 treatment was not observed in
wt/enos-kobm mice at any time point (figure 5a and 5b
and table ii in the online-only data supplement). similarly,
amd3100 treatment in enos-ko/wtbm mice but not in
wt/enos-kobm mice was associated with greater numbers
of enos+ bm cells, elevated bm  xxxg1440xxx 
and soluble kit ligand protein expression, higher pb sca1+/
 xxxg1274xxx + mnc counts, less cardiac apoptosis, and smaller infarcts
on day 3 after injury (figure 5d–5i) and with less cardiac

fibrosis and greater capillary density on day 28 (figure 5j
and 5k). the results associated with amd3100 treatment in
wt/wtbm mice matched those observed in enos-ko/wtbm
mice (figure 5c–5k), and the only treatment-related effect
observed in all 3 chimeric mouse lines was the enhanced
mobilization of cxcr4+ mncs, which occurred on day 1
after injury and diminished by day 3 (figure 5l). thus, the
benefits associated with amd3100 administration after ir
injury require enos expression in the bm but not in the ischemic region, and enos appears to have a role in the mobilization of sca1+/ xxxg1274xxx + mncs but not cxcr4+ mncs.

the expression of enos by pb epcs contributes
to myocardial recovery but is not required for
epc incorporation
because bm enos expression is required for both the beneficial effects of amd3100 treatment after ir injury and the
mobilization of progenitors from bm to pb, we investigated
whether enos expression in circulating bmpcs contributes
to myocardial recovery. bmpcs were isolated from wt mice
and enos-ko mice, cultured for 4 days, and then intravenously injected into wt mice 24 hours after ir injury; a
third group of mice were injected with saline. fourteen and
28 days after ir injury, lv fractional shortening was significantly greater in mice administered wt bmpcs than in mice
administered saline, but the difference between treatment with

enos-ko bmpcs and saline administration did not reach
statistical significance (figure 6a and table ii in the onlineonly data supplement).
to determine whether the expression of enos by circulating bmpcs contributes to myocardial recovery by increasing
the incorporation and whether amd3100 enhances the incorporation of circulating bmpcs, wt and enos-ko epcs were
labeled with dii and intravenously injected into wt mice 24

mice were euthanized 3 days after ir injury for histological
analyses. neither the type of cell injected (ie, enos-ko or
wt) nor the treatment administered (ie, amd3100 or saline)
significantly influenced the incorporation of injected cells
(figure 6b). nevertheless, apoptotic cells were significantly
less common and infarct sizes were significantly smaller in
mice administered wt bmpcs than in mice administered
enos-ko bmpcs, regardless of treatment group, and measurements in mice administered enos-ko bmpcs did not
differ significantly from those in saline-treated mice (figure
6c and 6d).
collectively, these observations suggest that the expression
of enos by circulating bmpcs does not have a role in their
recruitment and incorporation but does contribute to cardiac
protection. therefore, the greater number of bm-derived
endothelial cells observed in the aar of amd3100-treated
mice (figure 3c) appears to evolve primarily through

infarction patients. amd3100 enhanced the mobilization
of bm-derived progenitor cells, including epcs, that were
incorporated into aar and exerted cardioprotective effects
by antiapoptosis and anti-inflammation in the acute phase
and revascularizing effects in the remote phase, resulting
in minimization of scar size and preservation of cardiac
functions.

amd3100 has been approved by the us food and drug
administration for use as a stem cell mobilizing agent25;
however, few reports have evaluated the time course and
subpopulations of cells mobilized by amd3100 administration
after ir injury. our results indicate that rapid accumulation of
circulating mncs, specifically inflammatory cells, into aar
accounts for the decreased number of mncs in pb on day 1

after ir injury. on the other hand, ir injury could be a trigger
to mobilize progenitors (ie, cxcr4+ or  xxxg341xxx +/ xxxg1274xxx + mncs,
including epcs) from bm, resulting in the increased number
of progenitors in pb. amd3100 increased the mobilization
of cxcr4+ cells on day 1 after ir injury by disrupting  xxxg560xxx –cxcr4 binding in bm, but this enhancement dissipated
before the expression of sdf-1, a ligand of cxcr4, was
upregulated in ischemic myocardium on day 3 after ir injury.
the delay in sdf-1 upregulation may explain why the rapid
mobilization of cxcr4+ cells did not result in a dramatic
increase in bm-derived cell recruitment to the aar on day 1
after ir injury. the amd3100-induced delayed enhancement
of sca1+/ xxxg1274xxx + mnc mobilization coincided with elevated
bm levels of enos and 2 enos-targeted proteins, matrix
metalloproteinase-9 and soluble kit ligand, that have been
linked to progenitor cell mobilization,24,26 and the enhanced
mobilization of progenitors required bm enos expression.
enos is known to protect cardiomyocytes against
apoptosis,27,28 and amd3100 treatment led to increases in the
number of enos-expressing cells, to declines in the number
of apoptotic cells, and to a reduction in infarct sizes in aar
on day 3 after ir injury. similarly, systemically injected
enos-expressing wt bmpcs but not enos-ko bmpcs
were associated with less apoptosis and smaller infarct sizes
in both amd3100-treated and saline-treated mice on day 3
after injury, even though the number of recruited cells in both
cell types in the aar was similar. additionally, in ir-injured
mice without amd3100 treatment, enos expression in bm
was upregulated by myocardial transient ischemia alone from
day 1 through 7; therefore, amd3100 was assumed to give an
extra elevation of enos production in bm cells over ischemic
insult.
in the mechanistic aspect, it was reported that enosexpressing cells enhanced  xxxg2413xxx  (vegf) protein production.29 as known broadly, vegf
upregulates enos expression, suggesting that initial upregulation of enos expression was sustained up to day 7 after ir
injury with amd3100 treatment via an autocrine mechanism
involving the vegf-enos signaling pathway. we previously
showed that vegf played a crucial role in mobilizing progenitors from bm into pb in a mouse coronary ligation model.
however, in the present study, we confirmed a direct effect of
amd3100 on enos upregulation by reporter assay (figure
iiic in the online-only data supplement). in addition, enos
mrna expression was upregulated >2-fold in the amd3100treated bmpcs compared with control bm pcs, whereas
vegf mrna expression was limited to a <2-fold increase
in the amd3100-treated group (figure iv in the online-only
data supplement). thus, amd3100 could directly enhance
enos production in the recruited cultured bmpcs in ischemic myocardium, suggesting that amd3100 might exhibit
a cardioprotective effect via the recruited bmpc-derived
enos production, at least in part, in the wt and enos-ko
bmpc injection experiment. in addition, on the basis of the
evidence that enos promoted angiogenesis and reduced
apoptosis by inhibition of transforming growth factor- xxxg836xxx  signaling,30 imported bmpc-derived enos may contribute to
enhance capillary density after ir injury via a similar mechanism. thus, the cardioprotective effects of amd3100-induced

enos activity are a crucial component of the response to
ir injury, but these effects appear to evolve primarily from
bm-derived progenitors rather than from cells already present
in the aar.
in terms of the contribution of the mobilized bm-derived
progenitors by amd3100 to ischemic myocardium, although
there is no direct evidence that circulating cxcr4+ cells
incorporated into the aar in the acute phase after ir, the
peak number of mobilized cxcr4+ cells was striking (10
times more than that of mobilized sca1+/ xxxg1274xxx + cells); therefore, cxcr4+ cells may play a role in the aar. referring to
the reports in which cxcr4-expressing cells were shown to
enhance incorporation into ischemic area and to improve cardiac function after myocardial infarction31,32 and the fact that
the plasma half-life of amd3100 is very short (3.5 hours) in
circulation, mobilized cxcr4+ cells might not be affected by
its recruitment to sdf-1–releasing sites of ischemia at day 1 to
3 after ir injury. even though the enos ko- or wt-cultured
bmpc infusion study did not show significant differences in
cultured bmpc recruitment to sites of ischemia, endogenous
progenitors, namely cxcr4+ cells and sca1+/ xxxg1274xxx + cells mobilized by amd3100, might recruit to ischemic myocardium,
exhibiting cardioprotective effects, because sdf-1 and vegf
are released from ischemic myocardium and recruit circulating progenitors expressing receptors of cxcr431 and  xxxg1274xxx .33
the findings presented here indicate that amd3100
improves the recovery of cardiac function after ir injury and
that the beneficial effect of amd3100 on ischemic heart with
ir injury requires enos expression in bm but not in myocardium. amd3100 sustains the mobilization of sca1+/ xxxg1274xxx +
mncs rather than cxcr4+ mncs, resulting in the increased
number of recruited bm-derived enos-expressing cells, and
contributes to limiting infarct size, reducing cardiac apoptosis, and increasing vascularity in ischemic myocardium.
collectively, single treatment with amd3100 may give rise to
a novel supportive therapy in percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty and stenting for acute coronary syndrome via
a cardioprotection/proangiogenesis-dependent mechanism.

study limitations
in this study, we have not definitively identified the mobilized
bm-derived cells by amd3100, including sca1+/ xxxg1274xxx + mncs
and cxcr4+ cells, providing direct evidence for the incorporation into vascular structure, however, we and others have previously demonstrated that not the majority but a certain extent
of these bm-derived cells were exactly incorporated into neovasculature in ischemic tissue.31,32,34–36 in addition, because we
have focused on the therapeutic effect of amd3100 with its
enos-dependent bmpc mobilization in pb and the recruitment to sites of ir injury, we have not tried to identify what
type of cells, so-called epcs, defined by multiple cell surface
markers are incorporated into the neovasculature. the precise
definition of human/mouse epcs remains unclear and would
be quite difficult to ascertain.

clinical perspective
numerous clinical trials with cell therapy focusing on cardiac functional recovery after cardiovascular diseases, including myocardial infarction, have been performed over the past decade. despite a certain extent of favorable outcome by the evolutional
compared with conventional therapies, the trials have been required to overcome ethical, technical, and medical expense issues
that may hinder the development of a novel therapeutic strategy. we have shown here that single administration of the cxcchemokine receptor 4 antagonist amd3100 exhibited sufficient therapeutic effect on cardiac functional recovery via mobilizing
bone marrow–derived endogenous progenitor cells, including endothelial progenitor cells, by an endothelial  xxxd2738xxx  synthase–dependent mechanism in a mouse ischemia/reperfusion injury model. the easy-to-handle, low-invasiveness, and inexpensive therapy with amd3100 that we proposed in the present study can avoid the above-described hurdles to be cleared in clinical
trials for cell therapy. amd3100 treatment may not be able to restore cardiac function after myocardial infarction completely
but could be a potent supplemental option after the established coronary recanalization/reperfusion technique with percutaneous
transluminal coronary angioplasty balloons and stents. clinical trials of autologous stem/progenitor cell therapy are ongoing,
and positive outcomes have emerged, specifically in nonoption patients suffering from severe cardiovascular disease. our data
suggest that amd3100, an endogenous stem/progenitor cell mobilizer, has the potential to be a simple but promising additional
therapy, taking the place of stem/progenitor cell transplantation therapy for ischemic heart diseases.

supplementary methods
mice
all mice were obtained from the jackson laboratories (bar harbor, me, usa).
ischemia-reperfusion (ir) injury was induced in 10- to 12-week-old male c57bl/6j wt
mice, in female c57bl/6j wt mice transplanted with bm from male transgenic gfpexpressing (c57bl/ xxxd3352xxx [cag-egfp]1osb/j) mice, in female c57bl/6j wt mice
transplanted with bm from male enos-ko (b6.129p2-nos3tm1unc/j) mice, in female
enos-ko mice transplanted with bm from male c57bl/6j wt mice, in female

wt mice transplanted with bm from male  xxxg2259xxx /gfp transgenic (stock
tg[tie2gfp]287sato/j) mice, and in male c57bl/6j wt mice or enos ko mice that
had been intravenously injected with bmpcs from male enos-ko mice or c57bl/6j
wt mice. experiments in the absence of ir were performed with 10- to 12-week-old,
male c57bl/6j wt mice. all surgical procedures and animal care protocols were
approved by the northwestern university animal care and use committee.

bone-marrow transplantation
donor mice were age-matched to recipient mice aged 4-6 weeks. the transplantation
procedure was performed as described previously.1,2 briefly, the bone marrow of
recipient mice was ablated with radiation (12.0 gy for c57bl/6j mice and 9.0 gy for
fvb mice), then 5 x 106 donor bone-marrow cells were injected intravenously, and the
transplanted bone marrow was allowed to regenerate for 6-8 weeks before subsequent
experimental procedures were performed.

ir injury model and treatment
ir injury was induced as described previously.3 briefly, mice were anesthetized, orally
intubated, placed in a supine position on a warm circulating water pad covered with a
sterile drape, and a left thoracotomy was performed in the fourth intercostal space;
1

respiration was controlled with a mechanical rodent ventilator (nemi scientific, inc.,
framingham, ma) (tidal volume 0.4 ml, rate 100 strokes/min). the pericardium was
removed, and a curved tapered needle was used to pass an 8-0 monofilament nylon
suture under the lad artery just proximal to the first diagonal branch. to secure the
occlusion without damaging the artery, the suture was tightened over a polyethylene bar
that had been placed on the lad. ischemia was verified by epicardial cyanosis, and the
occlusion was maintained for 60 minutes before reperfusion while anesthesia was
maintained via intraperitoneal administration of tribromoethanol every 20 minutes.
reperfusion was induced by removing the polyethylene bar and verified by epicardial
hyperemia; then, the suture was left in place, the chest was closed, and treatment was
administered. mice received a single subcutaneous injection of amd3100 (5 mg/kg, 125
ug in 100 ul; sigma-aldrich co, st. louis, mo) or an equal volume of saline.

aar and infarct area
animals were anesthetized and intubated for mechanical ventilation; then, a left
thoracotomy was performed in the fourth intercostal space and a 7-0 silk suture was
inserted around the pulmonary artery and aorta. the lad artery was re-occluded for 5
minutes by tightening the suture used for the induction of ir injury; then, the suture
around the pulmonary artery and aorta was briefly tightened, and 750,000 microspheres
(15-um diameter; sterispheres, biopal, worcester, ma, usa) were injected into the
lv through the apex. five minutes later, the heart was arrested by injecting 0.15 ml of
100 mm cadmium chloride into the right ventricle, excised, placed in an agarosecontaining well, and cut into 8-12 500-um transverse sections. the sections were
stained for 10 minutes at 37°c in wells containing 1.5% triphenyltetrazolium chloride
(ttc) solution and digitally photographed under a dissecting microscope. areas of
viable tissue were stained deep red, the aar was identified by the lack of microspheres
(which appeared as blue-gray dots, when present), and the infarcted area remained
colorless. for each mouse, the aar, the area of the infarct, and the area of the lv were
quantified via computerized planimetry (imagej: nih image); aar was presented as a

2

percentage of the area of the entire lv, and the infarct area was presented as a
percentage of the aar.

bm  xxxg1440xxx  and skitl protein levels
bone marrow plasma was collected by flushing femurs and tibias with 0.5 ml of pbs
and then centrifuged for 20 minutes at 2,000 g and 4ºc and for 10 minutes  xxxd1891xxx ,000 g
and 4ºc. supernatant levels of  xxxg1440xxx  and skitl were measured by elisa (r&d
systems, minneapolis, mn usa).4

pb cell counts
blood (150 ul) was collected from the orbital veins of anesthetized mice. total pb mnc
counts were measured by determining the number of lymphocytes and monocytes in 10
ul of the blood sample with a hemavet mascot multispecies hematology system
counter 1500 r (cdc technologies inc., oxford, ct). for facs analyses, mncs were
isolated from the remaining sample via gradient-density centrifugation with histopaque1083 (sigma- aldrich corp.) as described previously3 and labeled with fitc-conjugated
anti-mouse sca1 antibodies, pe-conjugated anti-mouse  xxxg1274xxx  antibodies, and apcconjugated anti-mouse cxcr4 antibodies (bd pharmingen inc, san diego, ca, usa);
then, the number of sca1+/ xxxg1274xxx + mncs and cxcr4+ mncs in the mnc fraction was
determined with a dako cytomation cyan flowcytometer and flow-jo software (tree
star, inc., ashland, or, usa). isotype-matched igg antibodies (jackson
immunoresearch laboratories inc., west grove, pa, usa) were used as negative
controls, and 100,000 events were counted per sample.5 mncs positive for both sca1
and  xxxg1274xxx  expression were considered bmpcs, and pb cell counts were calculated by
multiplying the total pb mnc count by the proportion of positively-stained cells in the
mnc fraction. for the bmpc culture assay, mncs were isolated from 500 ul of pb via
density gradient centrifugation and cultured for 4 days in supplemented ebm-2 (lonza
walkersville inc., walkersville, md, usa) medium containing 5% fbs (singlequot kit;
lonza walkersville inc.) on 4-well glass chamber slides that had been coated with rat
 xxxg2422xxx  (sigma-aldrich corp.) in 0.1% gelatin; then, the cells were incubated with dii3

acldl (biomedical technologies inc., stoughton, ma, usa) for 2 hours and stained
with fitc-conjugated  xxxd812xxx  lectin (vector laboratories, burlingame, ca, usa). spindleshaped cells positive for both acldl and  xxxd812xxx  lectin were considered bmpcs and
counted in 10 randomly selected hpfs (20x).

recruitment of systemically injected bmpcs
seven days before the induction of ir injury, mice were splenectomized as previously
reported6 via vessel ligation through a lateral incision in the left abdominal wall. bmpcs
were isolated from wt and enos-knockout mice, cultured for 6 days, and labeled with
dii-acldl for 2 hours before injection. bmpcs (5x105 per mouse) were injected
intravenously 24 hours after ir injury was induced, and mice were sacrificed 48 hours
later (i.e., 3 days after ir injury).

no production
the concentration of nitrate and nitrite (i.e., the final metabolites of no) was determined
with a nitrate/nitrite colorimetric assay kit (cayman chemical, ann arbor, mi, usa) as
directed by the manufacturer’s instructions and reported as the optical density at 540
nm wavelength. pb measurements were performed with serum from 500 µl of blood
that had been collected from the heart and centrifuged (1500 rpm, 4°c) for 15 minutes.
for measurements in cultured cells, bmpcs were cultured in ebm-2 medium containing
5% fbs, or in ebm-2/fbs medium containing 10 um amd3100 for 48 hours at 37°c.

histological and immunofluorescent assessments
histological assessments were performed in frozen or paraffin-embedded sections. to
prepare frozen bone sections, explanted bones were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde
for 5 hours, decalcified with 10% edta for 72 hours, and washed with 30% sucrose
solution overnight. for frozen heart sections, hearts were washed with pbs delivered
through both the right and left ventricle before excision and with pbs delivered through
the aorta after excision; then, the coronary artery was perfused with 4% pfa delivered
through the aorta, and hearts were kept in 4% pfa for 5 hours and in 30% sucrose
4

solution overnight. bone and heart samples were embedded in oct compound (sakura
finetek u.s.a., inc., torrance, ca, usa), snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and cut into
sections.

to prepare paraffin-embedded sections, the abdominal aorta was cannulated with a
polyethylene catheter, and 1 ml of heparin/pbs solution (100 iu/ml heparin, 0.2 m
pba, ph 7.4) was injected; then, 0.15 ml of 100 mm cadmium chloride was injected
through the catheter to arrest the heart in diastole, the thorax was opened, the heart
was perfused at mean arterial pressure with phosphate-buffered formalin, the right
atrium was cut to allow drainage, and fixative was delivered through a 25 g3/4
vacutainer (bd, franklin lakes, nj, usa) that had been inserted into the left ventricle.
at the end of the procedure, the whole heart was excised (beginning at the ascending
aorta), embedded in paraffin, and cut into sections.

fibrosis
fibrosis was evaluated in paraffin-embedded, masson-trichrome–stained heart sections
with a computerized digital image analysis system (imagej: nih image) and reported as
the ratio of the length of fibrosis to the left-ventricular circumference.

capillary density
capillaries were identified by injecting mice with bs-1 lectin (vector laboratories) 10
minutes before sacrifice, and then staining paraffin-embedded sections with anti-lectin
primary antibodies (vector laboratories) and alexa 555-conjugated anti-goat igg
secondary antibodies (invitrogen, carlsbad, ca, usa). capillary density was evaluated
by counting positively stained tubular structures in 3 sections, 3 high-power fields
(hpfs) per section.

bm-derived cell incorporation
bm-derived cells were identified in the hearts of female wt mice transplanted with bm
from male gfp-expressing mice by staining paraffin-embedded sections with anti5

mouse gfp primary antibodies (invitrogen) and alexa 488-conjugated anti-goat igg
secondary antibodies (invitrogen). positively stained cells were counted in 3 sections, 3
hpfs per section.

enos expression
enos-expressing cells were identified by staining frozen bone sections and paraffinembedded heart sections with anti- xxxg1579xxx  primary antibodies (santa cruz
biotechnology, inc., santa cruz, ca, usa) and alexa 555-conjugated anti-rabbit igg
secondary antibodies (invitrogen). positively stained cells were counted in 3 sections, 3
hpfs per section.

apoptosis
cells with fragmented nuclear dna were identified in paraffin-embedded heart sections
via the terminal deoxynucleotide transferase-mediated dutp nick end labeling (tunel)
method (roche molecular biochemicals, mannheim, germany) followed by dapi
staining. positively stained cells were counted in 4 sections, 3 hpfs per section.

in vitro assessments with cultured, bone marrow-derived progenitor cells
cell collection and enrichment
bm cells were collected by flushing mouse tibias and femurs with 3 ml of 5 mm edta in
pbs; then, bm mncs were isolated from the total bm cell population by density
gradient centrifugation with histopaque-1083 (sigma-aldrich corp.) as described
previously,3 plated (5x105 cells per cm2) on repcell® culture dishes coated with rat
 xxxg2422xxx , and cultured in ebm-2 medium containing 10% fbs. four days later, nonadherent cells were washed away and adherent cells were detached by leaving the
plates at room temperature for 30 minutes. the detached cells were re-seeded on
 xxxg2422xxx -coated plates and cultured in fresh ebm-2/fbs medium for 2 days before
subsequent experiments were performed.

mrna expression
6

bmpcs were treated with 10 um amd3100 in ebm-2 medium containing 5% fbs or
with ebm-2/fbs medium alone for 6 hours at 37°c; then, mrna expression was
evaluated via quantitative rt-pcr.

quantitative real-time rt-pcr
total rna was extracted from cultured cells with a qiaamp rna blood mini kit
(qiagen inc.) and from homogenized heart tissue with rna stat-60 (tel-test, inc.) as
directed by the manufacturers’ instructions. the rna was reverse transcribed with a
taqman cdna synthesis kit (applied biosystems) and amplified on a taqman 7500
(applied biosystems); primer and probe sequences are listed in the supplementary
table 1. expression was calculated via the comparative threshold cycle (ct) method
and normalized to 18s expression.

luciferase reporter assay
mouse endothelial cells (svecs) were co-transfected with a luciferase reporter
construct coding for the enos promoter (enos-luc, generated by switchgear
genomics, menlo park, ca, usa) and with a pcmvnlacz plasmid coding for betagalactosidase; transfection was performed with transfast transfection reagent
(promega corporation, madison, wi, usa) as directed by the manufacturer's
instructions. twenty-four hours after transfection, cells were starved overnight and
treated with 0 µm, 1 µm, 10 µm, or 100 µm amd3100 for 18 hours; then, luciferase
activity was measured with a luciferase system (promega) and beta-galactosidase activity
was assayed as previously described.7 for each sample, luciferase activity was
normalized to beta-galactosidase activity to compensate for differences in transfection
efficiency. each condition was assayed in triplicate, and each experiment was
performed at least three times.
