castration is the most widely used form of androgen ablation employed in the
treatment of metastatic (m1) prostate cancer. non-steroidal antiandrogen monotherapy is a potential alternative treatment option for men for whom castration is
unacceptable or not indicated. of the three non-steroidal antiandrogens,  xxxd334xxx  (‘ xxxd334xxx ’),  xxxd2143xxx  and  xxxd2725xxx , only  xxxd334xxx  has been
compared with castration in large, controlled, randomised, phase iii trials in
m1 patients. a post-hoc analysis of these studies indicated that  xxxd334xxx 
150 mg/day monotherapy may be of benefit to m1 patients with a prostate specific
antigen (psa) level  400 ng/ml. significant advantages for m1 patients treated
with  xxxd334xxx  were observed in subjective response rate, maintenance of
sexual interest and physical capacity. patients with a higher disease burden (psa
> 400 ng/ml) may decide that quality of life and symptomatic benefits outweigh
the slight survival disadvantage seen in clinical trials and opt for  xxxd334xxx 
monotherapy as an alternative to castration. prostate cancer and prostatic diseases

introduction
since androgen sensitivity of prostate cancer was demonstrated in 1941,1 the mainstay of treatment for metastatic
(m1) prostate cancer has been androgen deprivation,
generally achieved by castration, either bilateral orchiectomy or maintenance luteinising hormone-releasing hormone ( xxxg930xxx ) agonist therapy. a major disadvantage
associated with both methods of castration is the reduction in the levels of circulating testosterone originating
from the testes. this can adversely affect patient quality of
life, an important consideration in this palliative setting.
in particular, libido and sexual potency are generally
diminished2,3 and this may be unacceptable to some
men. additionally, some patients may have personal
reasons for avoiding castration, may prefer oral therapy,
or may not tolerate  xxxg930xxx  agonist therapy. there is,

therefore, a need for alternative treatment options for
these men.
compounds that interfere with the production and/or
function of androgens have been introduced for the
management of advanced prostate cancer. the action of
such antiandrogens results from the competitive inhibition of the binding of the metabolite of testosterone,
dihydrotestosterone (dht), to nuclear receptors in prostate cancer cells.4 steroidal antiandrogens have progestagenic properties and suppress gonadotrophins to lower
plasma testosterone levels, and this also results in
decreased libido and sexual potency. in contrast, nonsteroidal antiandrogens have no antigonadotrophic
effects. as well as binding competitively to the prostatic
intracellular androgen receptors, they also block androgen receptors in the brain, leading to successive increases
in  xxxg930xxx , luteinising hormone (lh) and testosterone
secretion. by maintaining levels of circulating testosterone, non-steroidal antiandrogens have less of an impact
on patients’ libido and sexual potency.5
as a result of increasing awareness of prostate cancer
and advances in early detection, patients are being treated
at an earlier stage of their disease. in the future, patients

with metastatic prostate cancer will probably have less
tumour burden and better performance status, and therefore will require treatment which has minimal impact on
their quality of life.
this review discusses the possible role of the three nonsteroidal antiandrogens —  xxxd334xxx  (‘ xxxd334xxx ’, a
trade mark of the astrazeneca group of companies),
 xxxd2143xxx  and  xxxd2725xxx  — as alternatives to castration
in patients with m1 prostate cancer. as well as examining
the survival data, the benefits of non-steroidal antiandrogen monotherapy with respect to subjective response and
quality of life are assessed. the tolerability profiles of the
three compounds are also compared.

survival data from non-steroidal
antiandrogen studies in m1 patients
 xxxd334xxx 
 xxxd334xxx  is a potent, non-steroidal antiandrogen and
has a half-life of approximately 1 week, which allows
once daily dosing.6 two large, multicentre, randomised,
phase iii studies of identical design compared  xxxd334xxx  150 mg/day monotherapy with castration in men
with locally advanced or advanced prostate cancer.7,8 a
total of 480 patients with non-metastatic disease (m0) and
808 patients with confirmed metastatic disease (m1) were
recruited.
a pooled analysis of the m1 patients was conducted at
a median follow-up of 100 weeks. survival data for m1
patients were considered mature at this point as 43% of
m1 patients had died. the data showed that  xxxd334xxx 
150 mg/day was less effective than castration with

respect to survival (hazard ratio (hr) 1.30; 95% confidence interval (ci) 1.04, 1.64; p ¼ 0.02).7 however, the
difference in estimated median survival times between
the  xxxd334xxx  and castration groups was small (6
weeks (42 days)), see figure 1.

197

 xxxd2143xxx 
 xxxd2143xxx  is also a potent non-steroidal antiandrogen, but
with lower affinity for the  xxxg183xxx  than  xxxd334xxx .9 it is rapidly and extensively metabolised, and the
plasma half-life of its major metabolite (thought to be the
active form of  xxxd2143xxx ) is 5 – 6 h.10 therefore, the parent
drug must be administered three times daily.
studies of  xxxd2143xxx  monotherapy against active comparators in patients with m1 prostate cancer are summarised in table 1. of these seven studies,10 – 16 only one
compared  xxxd2143xxx  monotherapy and castration.14
although no definite conclusions can be drawn from this
small study (104 patients), overall survival at 69 months
was identical in the two treatment groups. the other six
studies compared  xxxd2143xxx  monotherapy with other methods of androgen deprivation (table 1): maximal androgen
blockade (mab),16  xxxd1880xxx  (des),10 – 13 and  xxxd2041xxx .15 five of the studies reported no statistically significant between-group differences in survival.10 – 12,14,16 in
contrast, in the trial of 92 patients reported by chang et al,13
the des treatment group had a significantly longer overall
survival than  xxxd2143xxx -treated patients (43.2 vs 28.5
months; p ¼ 0.04), although median survival in the des
group was longer than normally expected in this setting.
however, interpretation of the results of all these studies is
difficult. the results of the largest study are only available in
abstract form,16 while all other studies lacked adequate
statistical power.

 xxxd2725xxx 
 xxxd2725xxx  is structurally similar to  xxxd2143xxx  but has a
longer half-life (approximately 2 days).17
there are no comparative studies of  xxxd2725xxx  monotherapy vs castration in m1 patients. published clinical
experience with  xxxd2725xxx  monotherapy is limited to a
single uncontrolled study of 26 previously untreated
patients with metastatic prostate cancer.18 the objective
response rate to  xxxd2725xxx  100 mg three times daily was
approximately 40%, with a median progression-free survival and median overall survival of 9 and 23 months,
respectively. however, because of the small sample size
and lack of control group, it is impossible to draw any
meaningful conclusions regarding the efficacy of  xxxd2725xxx  monotherapy.

does disease volume affect the efficacy
of antiandrogen therapy?
theoretical basis
there is a theoretical basis for antiandrogen efficacy being
affected by tumour volume. castration removes the major
source of androgens from the body, irrespective of disease
burden. in contrast, antiandrogens reduce exposure of
prostate cancer cells to androgen by competing for the
 xxxg183xxx  binding sites in the tumour cells.
therefore, the effectiveness of antiandrogens is partly
dependent on the number of  xxxg183xxx  binding
sites and, indirectly, on tumour burden. in addition,
tumour volume will affect antiandrogen penetration. it
follows that a dose of antiandrogen is likely to block
androgen receptors more effectively in a patient with a
low tumour burden than in a patient with a high tumour
burden. other factors, such as mutations in the androgen
receptor gene, which occur more frequently in metastatic
lesions than primary tumours, may also affect the binding
and therefore the efficacy of antiandrogens in patients,
particularly in patients with high-volume disease.

circumstantial evidence from clinical studies
the possibility that the efficacy of antiandrogen monotherapy may be dependent on disease volume is sugprostate cancer and prostatic diseases

gested by the findings of the two large  xxxd334xxx 
monotherapy studies.7 in contrast to the m1 setting, m0
patients (after a median follow-up of 6.3 y with a death
rate of 56%) demonstrated no statistically significant
difference in overall survival between the  xxxd334xxx 
150 mg/day and castration groups (hr 1.05; 95% ci 0.81,
1.36; p ¼ 0.70).8 in addition, in a small study of  xxxd2143xxx 
monotherapy, a post-hoc analysis of 28 evaluable m1
patients suggested  xxxd2143xxx  monotherapy might offer a
reasonable alternative to castration in patients with lowvolume disease.14 however, the authors recommended
that these results should be interpreted with extreme
caution. in this study tumour burden was stratified on
the basis of prostate specific antigen (psa), since psa
concentrations in the serum correlate approximately with
disease bulk.19,20
prostatic disease burden has been reported to affect
antiandrogen efficacy in mab regimens. two studies
have reported benefits for mab over castration in patients
with minimal metastases but not those with extensive
disease.21,22 however, a recent meta-analysis suggests the
trend for efficacy in minimal disease is in favour of
castration23 and therefore this question has yet to be
resolved.
pre-treatment psa values have also been found to be
related to survival outcome in a study of 67 patients with
metastatic prostate cancer treated with orchiectomy or
 xxxd2143xxx  plus  xxxd2229xxx  (‘zoladex’, a trade mark of the
astrazeneca group of companies).24 a psa level of
300 ng/ml could be used to discriminate between poor
( > 300 ng/ml) and better ( < 300 ng/ml) risk groups
(p ¼ 0.003).

evidence from studies of antiandrogen monotherapy
based on psa values, a post-hoc analysis of the two large
 xxxd334xxx  monotherapy studies7,8 was conducted to
establish whether there was a trend which related efficacy
to the burden of the disease within the m1 patient
population.
in this analysis, the m1 patients were divided into three
groups of approximately equal size according to baseline
levels of psa: < 100 ng/ml (n ¼ 271), 100 – 400 ng/ml
(n ¼ 246) and > 400 ng/ml (n ¼ 260). as shown in figure
2,  xxxd334xxx  150 mg/day and castration had similar
efficacy in m1 patients with psa  400 ng/ml

antiandrogen monotherapy in m1 prostate cancer
av kaisary et al

(psa < 100 ng/ml, hr 1.1; psa 100 – 400 ng/ml, hr 1.1). in
contrast, the survival data favoured castration in m1
patients with baseline psa > 400 ng/ml (hr 1.4).
similar data relating survival to disease burden are not
available from the comparative  xxxd2143xxx  monotherapy
studies.

effect of non-steroidal antiandrogens on
subjective response and quality of life in
m1 patients
subjective response
in the two large  xxxd334xxx  monotherapy trials, a total of
288 m1 patients were symptomatic at study entry and
therefore potentially able to exhibit a subjective response
during the study.7 criteria for a subjective response were
based on scores for performance status, cancer-related pain
and requirements for cancer-related analgesia. analysis

revealed that the subjective response rate was significantly
higher in the  xxxd334xxx  150 mg/day group than in the
castration group (70.0 vs 58.2%; p ¼ 0.046), see figure 3.7
the odds ratio for this difference was 1.68, an odds ratio of
> 1 indicating a greater chance of a subjective response
being observed in m1 patients receiving  xxxd334xxx .
data on the subjective response to  xxxd2143xxx  monotherapy is limited, but in their study comparing  xxxd2143xxx 
monotherapy and  xxxd2143xxx -based mab, pavone-macaluso16 reported that 66.2% of patients had a subjective
response to  xxxd2143xxx  monotherapy, a figure similar
to that reported for  xxxd334xxx  150 mg/day in the two
large monotherapy studies but inferior to that for
 xxxd2143xxx -based mab (79.8%).

quality of life

advances in early detection, quality of life has become

an important consideration in patients with advanced
malignancy receiving palliative treatment. a comparative
trial of 656 men with and without prostate cancer showed
that a decline in sexual function was the most common
cause of disease-specific stress,25 and hence reduced
quality of life. the impact of such factors can be considerable, with survey data showing that many men are willing to accept a treatment with higher mortality rates to
avoid a 100% chance of impotence.26,27
in the two large trials of  xxxd334xxx  150 mg/day
monotherapy compared with castration, quality of life
was assessed at 12 months by a questionnaire covering 10
quality of life dimensions (overall health, pain, emotional
wellbeing, vitality, social function, physical capacity, sexual
interest, sexual functioning, activity limitation and bed
disability).7 very few patients with m1 disease answered
the question on sexual function. when the results for m1
and m0 patients were combined, a non-significant trend
towards less reduction of sexual function was seen in
patients treated with  xxxd334xxx  compared with castration (20 vs 36%). in patients with m1 disease, statistically
significant advantages were demonstrated in patients randomised to  xxxd334xxx  for physical capacity and sexual
interest (p ¼ 0.032 and 0.041, respectively), see figure 4.7
only the quality of life domain ‘overall health’ favoured
castration and this was not statistically significant.
similarly, antiandrogen monotherapy ( xxxd334xxx 
150 mg/day) has been shown to confer quality of life
advantages over mab ( xxxd2229xxx  plus  xxxd2143xxx ) in a
study involving a total of 220 patients (49.5% stage m0
and 50.5% stage m1 prostate cancer).28 after a median
follow-up of 38 months, significantly fewer patients
receiving antiandrogen monotherapy complained of loss
of sexual interest (p ¼ 0.01) and erectile dysfunction
(p ¼ 0.002) than in the mab group. there were also
significant trends favouring antiandrogen monotherapy
with respect to other quality of life parameters, ie social
prostate cancer and prostatic diseases

functioning, vitality, emotional wellbeing, and physical
capacity.
there are no data on the comparative effects of  xxxd2143xxx  monotherapy vs castration on sexual parameters, as
the majority of the patients studied by boccon-gibod and
colleagues14 were impotent before study entry. comparative data on other aspects of quality of life were not
reported in any of the  xxxd2143xxx  monotherapy studies.

tolerability of non-steroidal
antiandrogens
antiandrogen monotherapy is generally well tolerated in
men with metastatic prostate cancer, although differences
in side effect profiles are apparent, which may influence
the choice of antiandrogen.
in the two large-scale  xxxd334xxx  monotherapy studies, the events reported most frequently by the patients
with m1 disease treated with  xxxd334xxx  150 mg/day
were breast pain and gynaecomastia.7,8 this was as
expected because antiandrogens block receptors in a
variety of testosterone-sensitive tissues, leaving unopposed oestrogen action in the breast. the incidence of
hot flushes was lower in the  xxxd334xxx  group (9.5%)
than in the castration group (38.6%). otherwise the
adverse event profiles for the two treatment groups
were similar. the incidence of diarrhoea was low in
both treatment arms (3.9 and 5.8% in the bicalutamidetreated patients from the two studies, respectively). few
m1 patients in the  xxxd334xxx  monotherapy group
discontinued treatment due to drug-related adverse
events (2.2%) (astrazeneca, data on file).  xxxd334xxx 
was not associated with clinical hepatotoxicity in this
study, although isolated cases of elevated liver enzymes
were observed.29 cases of hepatic failure in  xxxd334xxx -

treated patients are rare.30 interstitial pneumonitis, an
inflammatory condition of the lung, has also only been
reported with  xxxd334xxx  therapy in isolated cases.31
gynaecomastia and breast pain are also the most
common adverse events observed during  xxxd2143xxx 
monotherapy for advanced prostate cancer.32 gastrointestinal side effects, in particular diarrhoea, are also commonly associated with  xxxd2143xxx  treatment,33 – 35 which
can lead to treatment withdrawal.32 additionally, cases
of clinical hepatotoxicity have been documented during
 xxxd2143xxx  therapy,32,36 some of which have been fatal.36
 xxxd2725xxx  is associated with delayed adaptation to
darkness after exposure to bright light,37 – 42 nausea and
vomiting,18,38 – 40 and alcohol intolerance.18,39,40,43 these
problems have not been associated with either  xxxd334xxx  or  xxxd2143xxx . in the small uncontrolled study
reported by decensi et al18 decreased adaptation to darkness, nausea and alcohol intolerance were reported by
30.8, 26.9, and 19.2% of m1 patients, respectively. interstitial pneumonitis has also been reported with
 xxxd2725xxx .32,39,42,44,45
there are no direct comparisons between the nonsteroidal antiandrogens in the monotherapy setting.
however, in the mab setting, diarrhoea was found to
be less frequent with  xxxd334xxx  therapy than with
 xxxd2143xxx  (12 vs 26%; p < 0.001).46 overall, withdrawal
from therapy due to adverse events occurred for 10 and
16% of patients receiving  xxxd334xxx  and  xxxd2143xxx ,
respectively. furthermore, there were fewer withdrawals
due to diarrhoea in the  xxxd334xxx  group than in
 xxxd2143xxx -treated patients (0.5 vs 6%). treatment-related
abnormal liver function test results were reported for 27
patients (7%) in the group receiving  xxxd334xxx  and 43

patients (11%) in the group receiving  xxxd2143xxx , but there
were no reports of fatal hepatotoxicity in either group.

conclusion
of the three non-steroidal antiandrogens, only  xxxd334xxx  has been compared with castration in controlled,
randomised, phase iii trials in m1 patients. indeed, the
majority of data on non-steroidal antiandrogen monotherapy in m1 prostate cancer originates from the combined results of two large-scale studies comparing
 xxxd334xxx  150 mg/day with castration.7,8 while  xxxd2143xxx  has been compared with castration and other forms
of androgen deprivation in phase ii and iii studies, most
studies had insufficient power to detect significant differences in survival outcome. there are no comparative data
on  xxxd2725xxx  monotherapy.
a post-hoc analysis of m1 patients in the  xxxd334xxx 
monotherapy studies, categorised by baseline psa values,
indicated that  xxxd334xxx  150 mg/day monotherapy
may be of particular benefit to m1 patients with a lower
disease burden (psa  400 ng/ml) for whom castration is
not indicated or acceptable. compared with castration,
 xxxd334xxx  150 mg/day monotherapy is associated with
a small survival disadvantage in m1 patients with a
higher disease burden (psa > 400 ng/ml). however,
because of quality of life advantages, these patients may
still decide on antiandrogen monotherapy. the efficacy of
second-line castration therapy following initial antiandrogen therapy has not been formally assessed. however, it is
prostate cancer and prostatic diseases

antiandrogen monotherapy in m1 prostate cancer
av kaisary et al

202

interesting to note that following progression in the m0
patients, some form of castration therapy was the commonest form of second-line therapy. patients treated with
 xxxd334xxx  tended to progress earlier than patients
treated with castration; however, there was little difference between the treatment groups in terms of survival.
this suggests that the development of a hormone-resistant
state with initial antiandrogen therapy is unlikely to be a
common problem, as patients still appear to respond to
second-line castration therapy. thus, initial  xxxd334xxx 
monotherapy may be followed by castration on progression, with little risk of decreased efficacy being apparent.
castration is the most widely used form of androgen
ablation employed in the treatment of metastatic prostate
cancer. patients may have personal reasons for avoiding
castration, may prefer an oral therapy or may not tolerate
 xxxg930xxx  agonist therapy. some men may also be willing to
choose an alternative treatment with lower long-term
survival in order to increase their chance of remaining
sexually potent.26 non-steroidal antiandrogen monotherapy is a potential alternative treatment option to castration in these men. the decision on which treatment option
to take should be made by the clinician in consultation
with the patient.
