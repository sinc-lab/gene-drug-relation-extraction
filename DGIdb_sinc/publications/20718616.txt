 xxxd3149xxx  is an  xxxg1079xxx  blocker frequently used in the treatment of
peptic ulcers.  xxxg1079xxx  blockers are reported to show antifertility activity.
to examine the mechanism of antifertility, estrogenic and antiestrogenic
activity was studied using an in vitro rat and rabbit uterine receptor binding
assay and in vivo using the uterotrophic assay in immature wistar rats.
the results revealed that  xxxd3149xxx  showed mild receptor binding affinity
to both rat and rabbit uterine receptors when compared to estradiol.
interstingly, in vivo  xxxd3149xxx  increases the wet uterine weight of immature
wistar rats significantly (po 0.001) when compared to a control group.
the increase in uterine weight within the  xxxd3149xxx  treated group was
somewhat similar to that of the estradiol treated group. histopathological
results and the structure of the  xxxd3149xxx  support that  xxxg1079xxx  blocker
 xxxd3149xxx  is an estrogenic compound.

h2 (histamine 2) receptor blockers (ranitidine,  xxxd2082xxx ,  xxxd3149xxx ,
 xxxd2744xxx ) are frequently used to treat peptic ulcers. histamine is involved
in the various stages of reproduction including ovulation [szego and gitin
1964; schmidt et al. 1988; kobayashi et al. 1983; jaiswal and krishna 1994;
schmidt et al. 1987; halterman and murdoch 1986; kitai et al. 1985],

[shelesnyak 1960; zipper et al. 1965]. various researchers have demonstrated that  xxxg1079xxx  blockers possess anti-fertility activity [agrawal
and alvin jose 2009; agrawal and aravinda 1995; brandon and wallis
1977]. the mechanism by which it produces this activity is still not clear.
our previous study revealed that h2 blockers (ranitidine and  xxxd2082xxx )

results
competitive  xxxg730xxx  binding curves
of the rat uterine receptor to  xxxd3149xxx  with
17- xxxd2037xxx  are shown in figure 1.  xxxd3149xxx 
showed 50% inhibition of [3h] estradiol binding at
250 ng as compared to 17- xxxd2037xxx  that produces
50% inhibition at 0.75 ng. the response to  xxxd3149xxx 
was then examined using the rabbit uterine estrogen
receptor model. the response from both models
are similar. a 50% inhibition with  xxxd3149xxx  was
achieved  xxxd1891xxx  ng as compared to 17- xxxd2037xxx  that
produced 50% inhibition at 0.065 ng level (fig. 2).
in comparison the in vivo uterotrophic assay
revealed that  xxxd3149xxx  significantly (po0.001)
increased the wet uterine weight when compared
to the control group. the uterine weight of the
 xxxd3149xxx  treated group was somewhat similar to
that of the estrodiol treated group. when  xxxd3149xxx 
was administrated along with estrodiol, no significant change in uterine weight was observed when
compared to the estrodiol treated group. but with
the clomiphine citrate treated group, a significant
(po0.05) decrease in uterine weight was observed
(fig. 3). this suggested that  xxxd3149xxx  is an estrogenic compound. in comparison samples treated
with estradiol and clomiphine citrate showed a poor
response to estrogen. the samples from the groups
 xxxd3149xxx  is an estrogenic compound

showed mast cell stabilizing activity which may
influence anti-fertility activity [agrawal and alvin
jose 2009].
however, there is a relationship between
histaminergic receptors and estrogenic activity.
intracellular histamine is important to growth and
its action may be antagonized by compounds that
bind to the anti-estrogenic binding site [brandes et
al. 1987]. there is clear evidence that estrogenic and
anti-estrogenic action of these various compounds
acts through histamine or histamine like receptors
[brandes et al. 1985; 1991; brandes and bogdanovic
1986]. the anti-estrogenic compound tamoxifen is a
histamine antagonist and the histamine antagonist
possess anti-estrogenic activity [brandes et al. 1986;
kroeger and brandes 1985; brandes and hogg 1990].
considering the above and the structure of the
 xxxd3149xxx , this study was undertaken to determine
the possible estrogenic and/or anti-estrogenic
activity of  xxxd3149xxx .

discussion
competitive rat uterine  xxxg730xxx  binding
curves were determined for  xxxg1079xxx  blocker
 xxxd3149xxx  along with 17- xxxd2037xxx . the results
revealed that  xxxd3149xxx  showed mild receptor
binding affinity. it showed 50% inhibition of [3h]
estradiol binding at a concentration of 250 ng as
compared to 17- xxxd2037xxx  that produced 50%
inhibition at 0.75 ng. 17- xxxd2037xxx  is the most
commonly accepted positive control in both in vitro
and in vivo estrogenic assay [korenman 1969;
blair et al. 2000]. the effect of  xxxd3149xxx  was subsequently confirmed in the rabbit uterine estrogen
receptor model. the t50 that is 50% inhibition was

figure 3 the relative estrogenic and anti-estrogenic activity of  xxxd3149xxx . the estrogenic and anti-estrogenic activity of  xxxd3149xxx 
was determined as a function of wet uterine weight. values were considered significant npo 0.05, nnp o0.01, nnnpo 0.001 when compared to the control group with a po 0.05 when compared to estradiol treated group; (n ¼ 6). values are expressed in mean7sem.

achieved  xxxd1891xxx  ng. the maximum competition with
[3h] estradiol for receptor sites in uterine cytosol is
dependent on the presence of a phenolic hydroxy
group in the third position [korenman 1969; shutt
and cox 1972; loose-mitchell and stancel 2001]. this
is similar to that observed in  xxxd3149xxx , consistent
with the view that may account for the estrogenic
activity.
the in vivo estrogenic and anti-estrogenic activities
of  xxxd3149xxx  were evaluated by the uterine weight
assay in immature wistar rats [vogel and vogel 1997;
emmens and miller 1969].  xxxd3149xxx  showed a
significant (po0.001) increase in wet uterine
weight when compared to the control group. the
increase in uterine weight of the  xxxd3149xxx  treated
group was similar to that of estradiol treated group.
there was no significant decrease in uterine weight
when estradiol was co-administered with  xxxd3149xxx .
in contrast when treated with the anti-estrogenic
compound, clomiphine citrate, a significant decrease
(po0.05) in wet uterine weight was observed.
in vivo studies showed that  xxxd3149xxx  has a
similar uterotrophic activity as 17- xxxd2037xxx , but in
vitro the inhibition was less. this could reflect the
differential binding activity of the metabolites of
 xxxd3149xxx . the major metabolites of  xxxd3149xxx  in
rats and dogs are 2-hydroxy-n- [3[3[m (2-oxo-1piperidinyl methyl) phenoxy] propyl]  xxxd63xxx ,
3-[m(1-piperidinyl methyl) phenoxy] propylamine,

2-hydroxy-n- [3[3[m (2-oxo-1-piperidinyl methyl)
phenoxy] propyl]  xxxd63xxx  is only found in rats
[honma et al. 1987]. therefore, it could be that
in rats the metabolite 3-(1-piperidinyl methyl) phenol
was responsible for the estrogenic activity in vivo,
since it has a phenolic oh group like 17- xxxd2037xxx 
(fig. 4a and b).
the data presented above showed that  xxxd3149xxx 
possessed a robust estrogenic activity as assessed
both in vitro and in vivo. the anti-ovulatory and antiimplantation activity of  xxxd3149xxx  as observed in our
laboratory (unpublished data), appears to be due to
s. s. agrawal and m. alvin jose

their estrogenic activity. the use of  xxxd3149xxx  to
treat ulcers in patients of reproductive age requires
careful consideration. the estrogenic activity of other
h2 blockers needs to be evaluated but preliminary
data has suggested that ranitidine and  xxxd2082xxx 
do not possess any estrogenic activity (unpublished
data).

materials and methods
in vitro receptor binding assay
the assay was adapted from bayard et al. [1978]
and verma and laumas [1981].  xxxd3149xxx  was a gift
obtained from hoechst marian roussel ltd., mumbai
and their analytical data was used for this study.
17- xxxd2037xxx  (sigma, st. louis, missouri, usa) and
radioactive estrogen (3h-estrogen; amershan, uk)
were purchased and utilized for the study.

tissue specimens
rats
all animal treatments and protocols received prior
approval from the institutional animal ethical
committee. inbred wistar 3–5 month old female
rats , issued from the animal house of delhi institute
of pharmaceutical sciences and research (dipsar)
were used for this study. the animals were
ovarectomized by the dorsal route under ether
anesthesia. thereafter, the rats were primed for
2 days with estradiol (10 mg in 1 ml saline i.p/day).
on day 4 the animals were sacrifice using ether
anesthesia and the uteri were removed and
washed in a xx m tegd buffer ph 7.4 containing
tris 10 mm, edta 1.5 mm,  xxxd2668xxx  1 mm,
mercaptoeethanol 1 mm, glycerol 10%. ethylene
diamine tetra acetic acid (edta), xx m  xxxd2668xxx ,
xx m glycerol and xx m  xxxd26xxx ) and
used for the study.

preparation of uterine cytosol
fraction
sliced uteri were washed in cold xx m  xxxd3449xxx 
(ph 7.4). slices were minced immediately and homogenized in a polytron homogenizer. the sample was
homogenized for a series of 10 s intervals. between
each interval the tissue was cooled for 2 min. the
cytosol (supernatant) was prepared by centrifuging
the homogenate at 35,000  rpm (100,000 g) for 1 h at
3–41c using ultra centrifuge (sorvall ultracentrifuge,
dupont, newtown, connecticut, usa).

assay
aliquots of cytosol (100 ml) were added to the tube
containing 10 pg of (2, 4 3h) estradiol while varing the
concentration of  xxxd3149xxx  (10 pg–100 ng) in 20 ml
of buffer. those compounds, which did not compete
at 100 ng, were further tested up to 10 mg. the tubes
were vortexed for 10 s and left for incubation at
2–41c for 12–16 h. at the end of incubation 0.5 ml of
0.5% charcoal and 0.05% dextran t70 prepared in
buffer was added to each tube at 0–41c. the tubes
were vortexed for 10 s and allowed to stand in ice for
20 min followed by centrifugation at 3,000  rpm
(2318 g) in an iec pr 6000 for 20 min. the supernatant was quantitatively decanted into vials.

radioactivity
radioactivity was measured in a liquid scintillating
spectrometer (1211 minibeta). the samples were
counted using diotol scintillation fluid (250 ml  xxxd1904xxx ,
150 ml methanol, 250 ml toluene, 52 g naphthalene,
3.25 g 2,5-diphenyl oxazole and 65 mg 1,4-bis-2
(4-methyl-5-phenyloxazolyl) benzene). the assays
were repeated four times and the mean values were
plotted.

in vivo uterotrophic assay
rabbits

animals

inbred female new zealand rabbits of 1.5–2 kg
issued from the animal house of dipsar were
used for this study. the animals were sacrificed
by ether anesthesia and the uteri were removed
and washed in a  xxxd3449xxx  as above for use in
this study.

the assay was adapted from vogel and vogel
[1997] and emmens and miller [1969]. immature
female wistar rats weighing about 55 g were
obtained from the dipsar animal house and
maintained under standard conditions at 21711c
and 50–60% relative humidity with a photoperiod of

12 h light/12 h dark. the animals were fed with
standard pellet diet and water ad libitum. the
protocols received prior approval from the institutional animal ethical committee and experiments
were conducted in accordance with guidelines set
by the cpcsea (committee for the purpose of
control and supervision of experiments on animals),
india.

pharmaceuticals
gift samples of each pharmaceutical were
obtained from various pharmaceutical companies
along with their analytical data,  xxxd3149xxx  (hoechst
marian roussel ltd, mumbai), clomiphine citrate (li
taka pharmaceuticals, pipri, pune), and estradiol
valerate (kilitch drugs (1) ltd., mumbai). solutions
containting 0.5% solution of cmc (carboxy methyl
cellulose)were prepared freshly in sterile water and
used for the daily administration.

animal experimentation
ovarectomy
the animals were anaesthetized with ether. a single
transverse incision was made in the skin of the back.
that incision could be shifted readily from one side
to the other so as to lie over each ovary in turn.
a small puncture was then made over the site of the
ovary, which can be seen through the abdominal
wall, embedded in a pad of fat. the tip of a pair of
fine forceps was introduced and the fat around the
ovary was grasped, care being taken not to rupture
the capsule around the ovary itself. the tip of the
uterine horn was then crushed with a pair of artery
forceps and the ovary together with the fallopian
tube was removed with a single cut by a pair of fine
scissors. the muscular wound was closed by
absorbable sutures (ethicon, chromic 2.0, johnson
and johnson, mumbai) and the outer skin wound
was closed by nylon suture.

uterine weight
immature female wistar rats weighing about 55 g
were ovarectomized and divided into different
groups containing six animals each. the animals
were treated with  xxxg1079xxx  blocker  xxxd3149xxx 
for seven days subcutaneously. estradiol was used
290

as the estrogenic and clomiphine citrate as the
anti-estrogenic compound, respectively. on day 8
the animals were sacrificed and both uteri were
excised immediately and wet uterine weight was
determined.

histopathological studies
the uterus of one animal from each group was
excised and immediately stored in a 10 % buffered
formalin solution and subjected to histopathological
evaluation using hematoxylin-eosin stain.

statistical analysis
one way anova followed by tukey’s test was
used to analyze the mean uterine weight of test
groups with the control group with the help of
graphpad instat software, version 3.01; po 0.05 was
considered significant.
