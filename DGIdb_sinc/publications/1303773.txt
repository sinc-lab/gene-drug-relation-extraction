[effect of loratadine (lo), a selective h1 antagonist, on histamine-induced bronchoconstriction].  the influence of single and repeated lo (10 mg/day) doses on histamine-induced bronchoconstriction was studied in 11 patients with stabile bronchial asthma. bronchial reactivity was estimated as histamine content potent to elicit a 20% fev, fall, i.e. pc20h. a single dose gave a significant (5.5 fold) reduction in bronchial reactivity to inhaled histamine. application of lo during 6 days gave a similar effect. withdrawal of lo for 6 days yielded an increase in bronchial hyperreactivity.
