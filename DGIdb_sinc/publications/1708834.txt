dna samples from a variety of human
tumor samples (leone a, mcbride ow,
weston a, et al: manuscript submitted for
publication). our data suggest that  xxxg1568xxx 
expression does not suppress colon cancer metastases. such tissue specificity has
previously been demonstrated for one established suppressor gene, the retinoblastoma gene, which shows increased
expression of a wild-type product in
colon cancers relative to normal colon tissue (16,17). future studies are still required to prove that in colon cancer the
 xxxg1568xxx  product is of a wild-type and not,
as is true of the p53-suppressor gene, inactivated by mutation (18). however, we
currently conclude that, in colon, tissuespecific events dissociate  xxxg1568xxx  expresion
from metastases-suppression activity.

previous comparisons among transformed lines of different metastatic
capability and among breast carcinomas
of different metastatic capability have
demonstrated diminished  xxxg1568xxx  expression in the tumors and cell lines of
greatest metastatic potential (1-3j5).
these observations suggest that  xxxg1568xxx 
may be a metastasis-suppressor gene (13). this study now demonstrates  xxxg1568xxx 
expression in normal tissue and finds that
 xxxg1568xxx  expression is generally increased in
colon neoplasms relative to normal
mucosa. while the numbers of patients
studied are too small for final conclusion,
this study does not detect any diminished
 xxxg1568xxx  expression in colon tumors of high
metastatic capability compared with
lower stage neoplasms. similarly, we did
not find differences in  xxxg1568xxx  expression
between cell lines established from either
metastatic or nonmetastatic colon lesions.
our preliminary data suggest that in contrast to breast cancer, simple measurement of  xxxg1568xxx  transcript levels is not
likely to be valuable as a prognostic
marker in human colon cancer.
several lines of evidence suggest that
 xxxg1568xxx  may play an important role in cellular behavior. the gene  xxxg1568xxx  shares
78% amino acid homology with the awd
gene, a drosophila melanogaster gene
whose mutation results in aberrant development of multiple tissues in the adult fly
(4), and shares 77% amino acid sequence
homology with gipl7, a nucleoside diphosphate kinase from dictyostelium discoideum (14).
on the basis of these observations, it
has been proposed that  xxxg1568xxx  is a
nucleoside diphosphate kinase that may
function to activate ras or other g
proteins involved in signal transduction
(15). it has been proposed that  xxxg1568xxx  is a
metastases-suppressor gene, based on
findings indicating that diminished expression of  xxxg1568xxx  transcript correlates
with enhanced metastatic capability in
human breast cancer (7,5) and with enhanced metastatic capability among different clones of murine k-1735 cells,
different clones of oncogene-transformed
rat embryo fibroblasts, and different nnitroso-yv-methylurea-induced rat mammary carcinomas (2,3). supporting the
proposition that  xxxg1568xxx  may be a suppressor gene in human cancers is the finding
of somatic deletion of one  xxxg1568xxx  allele in

the growth of solid tumors beyond a
few millimeters in diameter is dependent
on sufficient blood supply (1-6). thus,
the control of neoangiogenesis is a very
attractive approach to suppress malignant
growth (6,7). few systemic effects would
result from selective inhibition of angiogenesis in the healthy adult, since neoangiogenesis and endothelial cell proliferation are absent except during wound
healing and the reproductive cycle.
studies of potential angiogenesis inhibitors (8,9) are hindered by the fact that
numerous stimuli can induce endothelial
cell proliferation in vitro (7,5). it is even
more difficult to define the relative contribution of different angiogenesis factors
in vivo (70).
we thus established a tumor model that
narrows down the angiogenic stimulus to
one defined factor, kaposi's sarcomaderived fibroblast growth factor ( xxxg789xxx )
(77). we have chosen  xxxg789xxx  because it
is a secreted species of the fgf family
and has been closely related to the growth
of the highly vascularized kaposi's sarcoma (12-14). using this model system,
we hoped to gain a more specific access
to potential angiogenesis inhibition along
a well-defined pathway.
the fgf-responsive, nontumorigenic
human adrenal carcinoma cell line sw13 was used as recipient of a  xxxg789xxx  expression vector. we previously demonstrated that this transfected cell line
develops colonies in soft agar by virtue of
an autocrine loop due to the production
and secretion of recombinant  xxxg789xxx 
(77). in athymic nude mice the sw-13/ xxxg789xxx  transfectants produce large tumors
with prominent blood vessel growth due
to the autocrine and paracrine stimulation
by secreted  xxxg789xxx . in preliminary reports, we indicated the potential use of
polysulfates as fgf-inhibitors (11,15).
the present data extend these observations and demonstrate, in vitro and in
vivo, the selectivity of  xxxd2878xxx  (pps) for inhibition of  xxxg789xxx -induced growth.

materials and methods
cell lines
mda-mb-231 (human breast cancer)
cells, huve (human umbilical vein endothelial) cells, and sw-13 (human adrenal cancer) cells were obtained from the

american type culture collection
(rockville, md) and were cultured in improved minimum essential medium
(mem; gibco laboratories, grand island, ny) with 10% fetal calf serum
(imem/fcs). for propagation of huve
cells, endothelial cell growth supplement
(ecgs; collaborative research, inc,
bedford, mass) was included in this
medium.
development of the sw-13 cell derivative sw-13/ xxxg789xxx  was described earlier
(77). in brief, sw-13 cells were transfected with an expression vector for  xxxg789xxx  and the gene for resistance to the
neomycin analogue  xxxd2191xxx . cells expressing  xxxg789xxx  messenger rna and protein
product were shown to form colonies in
soft agar and to grow into tumors in
athymic nude mice, due to the secretion
of biologically active  xxxg789xxx  protein
(77).
growth assays
studies of anchorage-independent growth
of sw-13/ xxxg789xxx  cells and breast cancer
cells in soft agar were carried out as
described earlier (77). in brief, 10 000
cells in 0.35% agar were plated on top of
a solidified 0.6% agar bottom layer in a
35-mm dish. imem/fcs medium was incorporated into both layers and contained
different additions as indicated in the
legends to figs 1 and 3. colonies more
than 60 (im in diameter were counted
after 2 weeks, using an image analyzer
(dynatech laboratories, inc, chantilly,
va).

propriate inhibitors, we used a human
adrenal cancer cell line (sw-13/ xxxg789xxx )
engineered to secrete kaposi's sarcoma-derived fibroblast growth factor
( xxxg789xxx ), which we previously showed
to induce growth of highly vascularized
subcutaneous tumors in animals by
autocrine and paracrine stimuli. in the
present study, we tested different
polysulfates for their selective inhibition of proliferation induced by  xxxg789xxx 
versus proliferation independent of  xxxg789xxx .  xxxd3266xxx  and  xxxd1860xxx 
showed slight selective inhibition of  xxxg789xxx -induced proliferation, ie, inhibition three- and five-fold greater,
respectively, than the inhibition of
proliferation independent of  xxxg789xxx . in
contrast, heparin was inactive. the
heparin analogue  xxxd2878xxx 
(pps), however, showed selective inhibition that was more than 2000-fold
greater. the inhibitory effects of pps
on growth of sw-13/ xxxg789xxx  cells, as well
as endothelial cells, were fully reversible by an excess of added fgf. daily
intraperitoneal injections of pps were
tolerated well by athymic nude mice
and prevented growth of subcutaneous
sw-13/ xxxg789xxx  tumor xenografts. pps
will be a useful tool to elucidate the effects of fgfs in vitro and in vivo and

detached with trypsin/edetate sodium
(trypsin/versene) and counted using a
particle counter (coulter corp, hialeah,

huve cells was measured in 50% confluent monolayers. growth media in dishes

and

polysulfates as inhibitors in vitro
in preliminary screening studies for
fgf-inhibitory compounds, we used
anchorage-independent growth of the  xxxg789xxx  transfected cells as a measure for
fgf-related inhibition (15). human
breast cancer cell lines which do not require polypeptide growth factors for
anchorage-independent growth were used
to monitor cytotoxic effects unrelated to
fgf. since fgfs share a high affinity for
heparin and related glycosaminoglycans
(17), we tested several polyanionic compounds for potentially inhibitory effects
in our model system (table 1).
as expected from other studies (13,18),
heparin by itself (<1000 h-g/ml) did not
affect the growth of the  xxxg789xxx -transfected cells (table 1). the polyanion

the  xxxg789xxx -transfected human adrenal
cancer cell line sw-13 grows in an
anchorage-independent fashion due to
autocrine growth stimulation by secreted
 xxxg789xxx . by immunoprecipitation, heparin-affinity chromatography, and assay
of fgf receptor binding, the secreted factor that stimulates growth of the sw13/ xxxg789xxx  cells was characterized previously
as authentic  xxxg789xxx  protein {11). this
finding is illustrated by the fact that
media conditioned by the sw-13/ xxxg789xxx 
transfectants stimulates growth of sw-13
control cells (fig 1). the activity present
in these media also stimulates endothelial
cell proliferation (fig 1) and can be
blocked in vitro by an fgf receptorblocking peptide (unpublished data).

the autocrine and paracrine growth
stimulation exerted by the sw-13/ xxxg789xxx 
cells leads to the formation of highly vascularized tumors in athymic nude mice,
as illustrated in fig 2. we have thus extended the finding of thompson et al (16)
that fgfs induce site-directed neoangiogenesis when applied locally, inasmuch as forced release of fgf from
tumor cells induces angiogenesis in the
surrounding tissue.

toxicityofppsin vivo
the toxic effects of pps, as assessed in
earlier studies in animals and humans, are
no different from those of heparin (19). in
initial dose-finding studies of pps in
athymic nude mice, we observed the expected dose-related heparinlike toxicity.
in a study with four groups of animals
(five per group) that were given a single
daily intraperitoneal dose greater than
100 mg/kg, we lost all animals within 10
days due to bleeding. however, animals
vol. 83, no. 10, may 15, 1991

receiving 25 or 50 mg/kg per day survived with no significant toxic effects for
another 2 weeks. the dose we chose in
our further studies (25 mg/kg) was tolerated by the animals for up to 3 months
without any apparent toxic effects.
effect of pps on tumor growth
in the tumor studies, we used shamtreated and heparin-treated groups of
animals as controls. tumor cells were inoculated subcutaneously, and 1 day later,
the treatment was initiated. as shown in
fig 4, tumor xenografts of the sw-13/ xxxg789xxx  cells grow exponentially in athymic
nude mice and the growth rate in the
heparin-treated group is indistinguishable
from that in the sham-treated animals.
daily treatment with pps, however, suppressed macroscopic tumor growth completely. in the group of animals presented
in fig 4, pps was withdrawn after 3
weeks, and six of the 15 animals developed detectable tumors within another 4
weeks. microscopy of these tumors (fig
5) shows a lack of the strong neoangiogenic response observed in the salinetreated and heparin-treated controls (fig
2). prolonged treatment with pps led to
total suppression of the reappearance of
tumors (data not shown). pps treatment
starting 1 week after injection of tumor
cells reduced the tumor incidence to half
of that in the controls but had no effect on
the growth rate of the tumors that developed despite the drug treatment (data
not shown). treatment of animals with
macroscopically visible tumors larger
than 8 x 8 mm (2-3 weeks after injection
of cells) did not inhibit further tumor
growth.

a pps-treated animal (original magnification x40).
note that no major blood vessel formation is observed.

discussion
based on our in vitro data (figs 1 and
3) as well as the animal studies, we conclude that repression of tumor growth by
pps is due to an inhibition of autocrine
and paracrine stimulation by  xxxg789xxx 
released from the tumor stem cells. the in
vitro data show that this inhibition is reversible by addition of an excess of fgf.
the antitumor effect does not appear to
be due to an anticoagulatory effect, since

many) at a concentration of 100 (j.g/ml
inhibited the growth of the model cell line
to 50% of that in control cultures (ic50),
but it was only threefold selective for
fgf-dependent versus fgf-independent
growth.  xxxd1860xxx  (sigma chemical
co, st. louis, mo) was slightly more
selective for fgf-dependent growth but
was clearly superseded by the heparin
analogue pps (19,20). an ic50 value of
about 1 ^ig/ml for anchorage-independent growth of sw-13/ xxxg789xxx  cells and
for endothelial cell mitogenesis was observed (fig 3). the growth inhibition can
be overcome by an excess of basic fgf,
indicating a reversible cytostatic effect
(fig 3). pps exerted no effect on mdamb-231 breast cancer cells, even at 2000
|ig/ml (table 1 and fig 3a) and is hence
more than 2000-fold selective for fgfdependent growth. other fgf-independent
breast cancer cell
lines
(mda-mb-435 and t- xxxd751xxx ) were equally
resistant to pps treatment. the high in
vitro selectivity of pps for the fgf pathway, independent from the origin of the
cells used, prompted us to choose this
compound for further studies in animals.

cy virus (hiv) (24). in light of our
present study results, it is tempting to
speculate that the effect of  xxxd3266xxx  might
be brought about by the high level of circulating glycosaminoglycans induced by
this agent (25) and thus may be an indirect effect now achievable with the
direct administration of a suitable glycosaminoglycan. clinical studies are in progress to test this hypothesis (26).

conclusions
the results of the present in vitro and
animal studies indicate that the tumor
growth supported by autocrine and
paracrine growth stimulation of  xxxg789xxx  is
inhibited by pps. our very recent tumor
xenograft studies with pps-resistant
human breast and prostate cancer cell
lines indicate that pps can also block the
fgf stimulus exerted by the tumor stem
cells and thus prevent tumor progression
in vivo (manuscript in preparation). pps
may hence become an extremely useful
tool to study the significance of the fgfmediated pathway in vivo and may be a
prototype for the development of growth
factor-selective tumoricidal agents.

heparin lacked an antitumor effect in vivo
and was ineffective in vitro. the loss of
efficacy of pps with increasing size of
tumors indicates reversibility of the inhibition in vivo: beyond a critical tumor
mass, the growth factor activity of the
tumor cells appears to overcome the inhibitory potential of pps. whether a more
frequent injection of pps or continuous
infusion of the drug could overcome this
higher growth factor stimulus remains to
be tested.
the different effects of the two closely
related drugs, heparin and its analogue
pps, seem astonishing, since pps has
been in clinical use as an anticoagulant
interchangeable with heparin (79). both
drugs act on the same step in the bloodclotting cascade by binding to antithrombin (79). very recent studies have
analyzed this interaction in more detail
and have shown that these polyanions occupy overlapping but discrete sites on this
protein (21).
it is possible that the different actions
of heparin in comparison to pps in our
tumor and angiogenesis model might also
be due to a differential interaction with
fgf. the binding sites for heparin on
basic fgf have been defined recently
(22), and a comparison with  xxxg789xxx  binding sites showed that, between the two
fgfs, the heparin-binding regions are
about 80% conserved (77). to understand
the polyanion-fgf interaction, we studied the ability of heparin and pps to
prevent the binding of radiolabeled basic
fgf to sepharose-immobilized heparin.
in this assay, even a 1000-fold excess of
pps over heparin failed to inhibit heparin
binding of fgf, supporting the notion
that the two polyanions have distinct and
exclusive binding sites on the fgf
molecule (unpublished data). we hypothesize that pps acts by blocking access
of the growth factor to its receptor,
whereas heparin fails to do so.
in addition to the antitumor effects
shown in the present study, ppsâ€”due to
its antiviral activityâ€”is a candidate for the
treatment of disease related to acquired
immunodeficiency syndrome (aids)
(20,23). interestingly, earlier reports have
shown some therapeutic effects of
 xxxd3266xxx  in the control of kaposi's sarcoma related to human immunodeficien-
