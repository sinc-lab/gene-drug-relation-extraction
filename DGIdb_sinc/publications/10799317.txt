activators of peroxisome proliferator activated receptors (ppars) are effective drugs to improve the
metabolic abnormalities linking hypertriglyceridemia
to diabetes, hyperglycemia, insulin-resistance, and
atherosclerosis. we compared the pharmacological
profile of a ppar␣ activator,  xxxd2096xxx , and a ppar␥
activator, rosiglitazone, on serum parameters, target
gene expression, and body weight gain in (fa/fa) fatty
zucker rats and db/db mice as well as their association
in db/db mice.  xxxd2096xxx  faithfully modified the expression of ppar␣ responsive genes. rosiglitazone increased adipose tissue ap2 mrna in both models
while increasing liver acyl coa oxidase mrna in
db/db mice but not in fatty zucker rats. both drugs
lowered serum triglycerides yet rosiglitazone markedly increased body weight gain while  xxxd2096xxx  decreased body weight gain in fatty zucker rats. krp
297, which has been reported to be a ppar␣ and ␥
co-activator, also affected serum triglycerides and insulin in fatty zucker rats although no change in body
weight gain was noted. these results serve to clearly
differentiate the metabolic finality of two distinct
classes of drugs, as well as their corresponding nuclear receptors, having similar effects on serum
triglycerides. © 2000 academic press

hypertriglyceridemia is a risk factor for cardiovascular disease (1). it is indirectly implicated in the progression of atherosclerosis via reductions in hdlcholesterol, incomplete catabolism of remnant lipoproteins and elevations of atherogenic small-dense ldl.
fibrates, via activation of the peroxisome proliferator
activated receptor-␣ (ppar␣) (2) and stimulation of a
large panel of genes controlling the ␤-oxidation and
catabolism of  xxxd2154xxx , ameliorate the above athero1

genic lipid profile in diabetic patients (3, 4). while
ppar␣ is expressed in several tissues including all cell
components of the vessel wall (5–7), its main effects on
serum lipid levels derive from the modification of hepatic genes of intermediate metabolism (2).
hypertriglyceridemia may be also directly linked to
diabetic hyperglycemia and insulin resistance via randle’s cycle whereby  xxxd2154xxx  and glucose compete as
an energy source in a variety of tissues. thiazolidinedione derivatives activate ppar␥ leading to an enhanced
insulin sensitivity and lowering of serum glucose (8).
ppar␥ is also expressed in a variety of tissues (6, 9,
10), though, again, reductions in serum triglycerides
are felt to be the result of a specific coordinated shift in
fatty acid flux from muscle to adipose tissue which is
linked to a ppar␥-mediated differentiation of preadipocytes (11).
thus, ppar␣ activation in tissues catabolizing fatty
acids such as the liver, and ppar␥ activation in peripheral tissues involved in fatty acid storage, represent two main treatment strategies to ultimately
reduce serum triglycerides. while thiazolidinediones
are essentially employed for the treatment of diabetic
patients, fibrates are being actively investigated in
patients both at risk for diabetes and/or atherosclerosis (12).
fatty (fa/fa) zucker rats and ob/ob mice are animal
models of diabetes and obesity, displaying hypertriglyceridemia, hyperglycemia and/or hyperinsulinemia
(13, 14). the pharmacological profiles of ppar␣ and
ppar␥ activators are sufficiently complementary that
it is logical to envisage their association in an exploratory fashion in models of diabetes and obesity. a previous report investigated the association of a fibrate
and a thiazolidinedione in non-diabetic animals (15).
in this report we investigated the effect of  xxxd2096xxx 
and rosiglitazone, or their association, in db/db mice.
additionally, we compared  xxxd2096xxx  and rosiglitazone with krp-297, which has been recently reported
to be a co-ligand for ppar␣ and ppar␥, in fatty (fa/fa)
zucker rats (16).

results
the effects of rosiglitazone,  xxxd2096xxx , and krp
297 on serum parameters db/db mice and
fatty (fa/fa) zucker rats
rosiglitazone and  xxxd2096xxx  both lowered serum
triglycerides and glucose levels in db/db mice treated
for 14 days (fig. 1a). for each drug, the percent reductions in triglycerides and glucose were similar, while
rosiglitazone was more active than  xxxd2096xxx . the
co-administration of rosiglitazone and  xxxd2096xxx  in
db/db mice did not significantly enhance the effects
observed with rosiglitazone, alone. in fatty zucker
rats, rosiglitazone reduced serum triglycerides and insulin more than  xxxd2096xxx . the effects of krp 297
were similar to those of rosiglitazone (fig. 1b).

the effects of rosiglitazone,  xxxd2096xxx , and krp 297
on ppar␣ and ppar␥-mediated gene expression
in db/db mice and fatty zucker rats
the effect of  xxxd2096xxx  on the expression of ppar␣mediated hepatic genes such as acyl coa oxidase
(aco) and apolipoprotein ciii (apo ciii) in db/db mice
and zucker rats conformed to what has been previously
published (figs. 2 and 3) (2). hepatic aco mrna
levels were increased in zucker rats and db/db mice
treated with  xxxd2096xxx  while apo ciii mrna levels
were reduced. in db/db mice, rosiglitazone treatment
also modified aco and apo ciii mrna levels, while
the co-administration of rosiglitazone did not significantly additionally alter the effect on aco and apo
ciii genes observed with  xxxd2096xxx , alone. rosiglitazone had no effect on aco mrna levels in fatty zucker
rats while krp 297 increased aco mrna levels by
60% (fig. 3). rosiglitazone increased adipose tissue
ap2 mrna in db/db mice and fatty zucker rats while
the co-administration of  xxxd2096xxx , which did not
modify ap2 mrna levels in either model, did not alter
the effect of rosiglitazone, alone in db/db mice (figs. 2
and 3).
thus,  xxxd2096xxx  faithfully modified only the expression of ppar␣-mediated hepatic genes in db/db mice
and zucker rats, while rosiglitazone, in addition to
increasing adipose tissue ap2 mrna levels in both

db/db mice and zucker rats, altered aco and apo ciii
mrna levels in db/db mice. krp 297, with the exception of a slight induction of aco mrna levels, did not
alter liver weight (results not shown) and displayed a
pharmacological profile similar to rosiglitazone, but
not  xxxd2096xxx , in fatty zucker rats (fig. 3).
the effects of rosiglitazone,  xxxd2096xxx , and their
association on body weight gain in db/db mice
in db/db mice after two weeks of treatment, rosiglitazone significantly increased body weight gain by 22%
while the latter was non-significantly reduced 10% by
 xxxd2096xxx , and co-administration of  xxxd2096xxx  did
not reduce the body weight gain induced by rosiglitazone (results not shown).
the effects of rosiglitazone,  xxxd2096xxx , and krp
297 on body weight change in fatty zucker rats
while rosiglitazone and  xxxd2096xxx  both lowered serum triglycerides their effects on body weight gain in
zucker rats were opposite, with rosiglitazone markedly
increasing body weight gain (fig. 4) while the latter
was reduced by  xxxd2096xxx . interestingly, despite a
serum pharmacological profile similar to rosiglitazone,
no significant increase in body weight was observed
with krp 297.
discussion
ppar␣ and ppar␥ activators can be pharmacologically differentiated by their respective centripetal and
centrifugal effects on fatty acid metabolism.
in db/db mice and fatty (fa/fa) zucker rats,  xxxd2096xxx  and rosiglitazone both reduced elevated serum
triglyceride concentrations yet rosiglitazone markedly
increased weight gain while  xxxd2096xxx  reduced weight

gain. these individual effects of  xxxd2096xxx  and rosiglitazone on body weight gain are evidence of a different
utilization of  xxxd2154xxx .  xxxd2096xxx  had no effect on
the adipose tissue marker ap2 mrna levels while hepatic ppar␣-dependent aco and apo ciii mrna levels were modified as previously described in rodents
(2). concomitant with the increase of fatty acid
␤-oxidation in the liver, the effect of  xxxd2096xxx  on body
weight gain may not be altogether surprising, as
ppar␣-deficient mice are obese (18). still,  xxxd2096xxx 
has been previously stated not to affect body weight in
sprague dawley rats (19). the effect of  xxxd2096xxx  on
body weight gain seen here may become evident only in
the context of an altered and enhanced flux of fatty
acids as seen in fatty zucker rats. in this respect, these
results may be more pertinent to the metabolic situation that exists in the diabetic patient. in zucker rats,
rosiglitazone increased body weight gain and did not
affect hepatic aco mrna levels. krp-297, while displaying a pharmacological profile similar to rosiglitazone and not  xxxd2096xxx , did not increase body weight
compared to control fatty zucker rats. we confirmed
transactivation of ppar␣-mediated genes in vitro (result not shown) with krp 297 (16), though only a
modest 60% increase in aco mrna levels was observed in vivo. still, as krp-297 did not provoke an
increase in body weight gain as seen with rosiglitazone, the slight increase in aco may be sufficient to
explain the difference in the body weight changes between these two groups of fatty zucker rats, although
aco induction may not be sufficient to outweigh the
effects of ppar␥ activation in db/db mice (see below).
rosiglitazone has been shown to have no effect on
body weight change in sprague dawley rats, although
adipose tissue weight was increased (15). in this latter
study, rosiglitazone had no effect on aco mrna levels. in contrast to fatty zucker rats, we observed an

448

increase in aco mrna levels in db/db mice treated
with rosiglitazone. rosiglitazone has been shown to
have qualitatively different effects on the expression of
proteins of peroxisomal fatty acid ␤-oxidation in obese
versus lean ob/ob mice (20). only in obese ob/ob mice
did rosiglitazone induce enzymes of peroxisomal fatty
acid ␤-oxidation, including aco, which was modestly
induced. furthermore, in obese ob/ob mice relative to
lean littermates as well as ppar␣ deficient mice,
ppar␥2 mrna expression is enhanced in liver, possibly as a result of the presence of steatotic fat-filled liver
cells (18, 19). therefore, the increase in aco with
rosiglitazone observed in our studies is similar to what
has been reported in a comparable murine model.
pioglitazone, a related ppar␥ activator, has been
shown to increase body weight gain in zucker rats
while plasma insulin levels were unaffected (21).
therefore, the degree of effects of thiazolidinediones
and fibrates on body weight gain and the expression of
hepatic genes of fatty acid metabolism may depend on
the animal model employed and the extent of hypertriglyceridemia.
the association of rosiglitazone and  xxxd2096xxx  in
db/db mice did not lower serum triglycerides or glucose
to a greater extent than rosiglitazone alone, due possibly to the already marked reductions observed with
rosiglitazone alone. after 2 weeks of treatment rosiglitazone significantly increased body weight gain in
db/db mice while the latter was non-significantly reduced by  xxxd2096xxx , and co-administration of  xxxd2096xxx  did not reduce the body weight gain induced by
rosiglitazone.  xxxd2096xxx -mediated ppar␣ activation
was thus unable to reduce the heightened weight gain
induced by rosiglitazone.  xxxd2096xxx  is an activator of
ppar␣, though probably not an endogenous ligand. as
 xxxd2096xxx  had no effect on weight gain in db/db mice
the effect of krp-297, which has been shown to be a
co-ligand for ppar␣ and ppar␥ (16) was investigated
in fatty zucker rats.
as rosiglitazone was capable of increasing aco
mrna in db/db mice yet, unlike  xxxd2096xxx  provoked
an increased weight gain, this would infer that the
increase in hepatic ␤-oxidation is secondary to the peripheral ppar␥-mediated effects of rosiglitazone. this
raises the possibility that  xxxd2154xxx  routed to adipose
tissue via ppar␥ activation have a reduced turn over
and are then cycled only slowly back to the liver to
potentially undergo ␤-oxidation.
the beneficial effects of  xxxd2096xxx  observed here on
several parameters of syndrome x suggest that more
potent ppar␣ activators and/or ligands could have
even greater impact on the underlying metabolic
causes of diabetes.
in conclusion, the ppar␣ activator  xxxd2096xxx  and
the ppar␥ activator rosiglitazone have been shown to
both reduce serum triglycerides in two models of diabetes and obesity. the resulting effect on body weight

is opposite as rosiglitazone increased weight gain while
 xxxd2096xxx  reduced body weight gain.
