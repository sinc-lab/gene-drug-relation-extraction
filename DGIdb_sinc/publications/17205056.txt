activating internal tandem duplication (itd) insertions in the
juxtamembrane domain of the  xxxg228xxx  are found in
about one fourth of patients with acute myeloid leukemia and
have been shown to be an independent negative prognostic
factor for survival. we show that sorafenib ( xxxd3226xxx ,
nexavar) potently inhibits  xxxg801xxx  enzymatic and signaling
activities. in hek293 cells stably transfected with  xxxg801xxx -wt or
 xxxg801xxx -itd, sorafenib blocked basal and ligand dependent flt3mediated tyrosine autophosphorylation as well as extracellular
signal-regulated kinase1/2 and  xxxg2216xxx  phosphorylation. in leukemia cell lines mv4-11 and eol-1, sorafenib treatment resulted
in decreased cell proliferation and inhibition of  xxxg801xxx  signaling.
the growth of the  xxxg801xxx -independent rs4-11 cell line was only
weakly inhibited by sorafenib. cell cycle arrest and induction of
apoptosis were observed upon treatment with sorafenib in
mv4-11 and eol-1 cells. the antitumor efficacy of sorafenib
was evaluated against the mv4-11 leukemia grown subcutaneously in ncr nu/nu mice. doses of 3 and 10 mg/kg
administered orally for 14 days resulted in six and nine out of
10 animals with complete responses, respectively. the demonstration that sorafenib exhibits potent target inhibition and
efficacy in  xxxg801xxx -driven models suggests that this compound
may have a therapeutic benefit for patients with  xxxg801xxx -driven
leukemias.

activating mutations in  xxxg801xxx  are found in approximately 25% of
acute myeloid leukemias (aml) and 5–10% of patients with
myelodysplastic syndrome (mds).1,2 these mutations are
primarily internal tandem repeat domain (itd) insertions within
the juxtamembrane domain of the enzyme3,4 which lead to the
constitutive activation of  xxxg801xxx  and ligand-independent
growth.6,7 sorafenib ( xxxd3226xxx , nexavar) is an oral multikinase inhibitor that targets tumor cell signaling and tumor
angiogenesis.5 sorafenib was recently approved by the food and
drug administration for patients with advanced kidney cancer,
and is continuing to be evaluated in other tumor types. in the
present study, we report that sorafenib potently inhibited  xxxg801xxx 
enzymatic and cellular activities and induced significant tumor
growth inhibition and regressions of subcutaneously implanted
 xxxg801xxx -itd containing tumors in athymic mice. these results
furnish evidence that sorafenib may provide therapeutic benefit
to patients with  xxxg801xxx -driven malignancies.

materials and methods

cell lines
rs4;11, mv4-11 and eol-1 cells were obtained from the dsmz
(braunschweig, germany). cells were grown in rosewell park
memorial institute 1640 (invitrogen, carlsbad, ca, usa) with
10% fetal bovine serum (fbs) (fisher scientific, pittsburgh, pa,
usa). mv4-11 cells were supplemented with 5 ng/ml of  xxxg526xxx  (biosource, cambridge, ma, usa).

cloning and expression of  xxxg801xxx -wt and  xxxg801xxx -itd
human full-length and cytoplasmic (571–993)  xxxg801xxx  cdnas
were isolated from a human fetal brain cdna library (clontech,
mountain view, ca, usa) by polymerase chain reaction (pcr).
the  xxxg801xxx -itd mutation was introduced using the quikchange
site-directed mutagenesis kit (stratagene, la jolla, ca, usa)
according to the manufacturer’s protocol using primers 50 -gtt

ttcc-30 and 50 -ggaatcactcatgatatatcgagccaatcca
aag-30 were used. to generate the gst fusion proteins, flt3wt (571-993),  xxxg801xxx -d835y (571-993) and  xxxg801xxx -itd (571-993),
cdna fragments were ligated into the pfastbac1 vector
(invitrogen) together with a cdna encoding gst. recombinant
baculoviruses expressing gst- xxxg801xxx -wt (571-993) and gstflt3-itd (571-993) itd were generated using the bac-to-bac
baculovirus expression system (invitrogen).

 xxxg801xxx  biochemical assay
the  xxxg801xxx  biochemical fret assay was performed in 96-well
plates and measured the ability of the enzyme to phosphorylate
biotinylated poly-glu-tyr. the reactions were carried out in a
100 ml reaction with a final concentration of 5 mm atp (sigma, st
louis, mi, usa), 20 nm poly-glu-tyr biotin (cis bio, cedex,
france), 1 nm eu-py20 antibody (perkin-elmer, boston, ma),
12.5 nm streptavidin-apc (perkin-elmer, boston, ma, usa),
50 mm n-2-hydroxyethylpiperazine-n0 -2-ethanesulfonic acid,
ph 7.5, 10 mm mgcl2, 0.1 mm ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid
(edta), 0.1% bovine  xxxg124xxx  (bsa), 0.1%  xxxd26xxx , 0.5% dimethylsulfoxide (dmso). recombinant
 xxxg801xxx -wt 1 nm and  xxxg801xxx -itd were added to a final concentration of 1.25 and 1 nm, respectively. incubations were performed
at room temperature for up to 90 min and were stopped with the
addition of edta to 10 mm. plates were read on a victor 3
instrument (perkin-elmer, torrance, ca, usa) at 615 and

665 nm wavelength and the 665/615 nm ratio was calculated.
ic50 values were generated using analyze5 (vissim, westford,
ma, usa) software. inhibition constants (ki) were calculated
using the cheng–pursoff equation (ic50 ¼ ki*(s/km þ 1)) in
nlreg software.

cell proliferation
effects on cell proliferation were measured using cell titer glo
reagent (promega, madison, wi, usa) as described previously.5
cells were seeded at 3000 cells/well in a 96-well plate and
grown at 371c in 5% co2 for 72 h.

cell cycle analysis and apoptosis assays
for cell cycle analysis, mv4-11 cells were exposed to drug for
72 h and then trypsinized, fixed, treated with rnase (roche,
indianapolis, in, usa) and stained with  xxxd3027xxx  iodide (pi)
(invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. samples
were analyzed by flow cytometry on a fluorescence-activated
cell sorter (facs) calibur instrument (bd biosciences, franklin
lakes, nj, usa). for apoptosis assays, mv4-11 cells were
exposed to drug for 72 h and eol-1 cells were exposed for 24 h.
after compound treatment the cells were harvested and stained
for apoptosis using the  xxxg166xxx -fluorescein isothiocyanate
(fitc) apoptosis detection kit (bd biosciences). samples were
analyzed by multicolor gating using a facscalibur flow
cytometer (bd biosciences).

when mice had established tumors ranging in size from 75 to
126 mg.

tumor mode of action studies
mv4-11 tumors (n ¼ 3 per group) were implanted as described
earlier and once the tumors reached 150–200 mm2 in size,
animals were treated with sorafenib (administered orally at 3 or
10 mg/kg) or vehicle. two treatments were administered 24 h
apart and tumors were collected 3 h after that second treatment.
the tumors were cut in half and one half was homogenized for
immunoprecipitation/western blot analysis and the other half
was fixed and processed for immunohistochemistry as detailed
previously.5 for  xxxg2216xxx  immunoprecipitation, 500 mg of proteins
were incubated with  xxxg2216xxx  antibody (santa cruz biotechnology, santa cruz, ca, usa) overnight at 41c and with protein a/
g-agarose for 2 h at 41c.  xxxg2216xxx  phosphorylation was measured
by probing with an anti-pstat5 (tyr694) antibody from upstate
biotechnology. for the immunohistochemical staining of
phosphorylated histone h3, a rabbit polyclonal phosphohistone h3 (ser10) (cell signaling) was used at a dilution of
1:50 with dako antibody diluent (dakocytomation, carpinteria, ca, usa). staining was performed using the envision plus
hrp dab system (dakocytomation). the staining procedure
was carried out according to the manufacturer’s protocol. the
slides were counterstained with mayer’s hematoxylin.

antitumor activity of sorafenib
d auclair et al

treatment of mv 4-11 cells ( xxxg801xxx -itd)7 with sorafenib
potently inhibited cell proliferation in a dose-dependent manner
with an ic50 of 0.88 nm (table 1). potent antiproliferative effects
of sorafenib were also observed with eol-1 cells which
overexpress  xxxg801xxx  wild-type receptor and also possess an  xxxg801xxx 
ligand (fl) autocrine loop.8 in contrast,  xxxg801xxx -independent
rs4;11 cells containing low levels of wild-type flt39 were
weakly inhibited by sorafenib, with an ic50 value of 12 mm
(table 1). the difference in sensitivity of the mv4-11 and eol-1
cells as compared to the rs4;11 cells suggests that a specific
proliferative signaling pathway was being inhibited in flt3dependent cells by sorafenib.

sorafenib induces cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in
 xxxg801xxx -itd leukemic cells
induction of apoptosis following treatment of  xxxg801xxx -itd leukemic mv4-11 and eol-1 cells was assayed by flow cytometry. in
mv4-11 cells, a concentration of 100 nm sorafenib induced
43.675.2% of the cells to undergo apoptosis whereas in eol-1
cells a concentration as low as 10 nm of sorafenib induced
89.2971.8% of the cells to become apoptotic (figure 1a).
eol-1 cells have been recently reported to also contain a
fip1l1-platelet-derived growth factor receptor (pdgfr) alpha
translocation, which results in a constitutive activation of
pdgfralpha.10 we have reported previously that sorafenib
potently inhibits pdgfr.5 inhibition of fip1l1-pdgfralpha

441
and the imatinib-resistant fip1l1-pdgfralpha t674i mutant by
sorafenib has also been recently reported by lierman et al.11
dual inhibition of pdgfralpha and  xxxg801xxx  in eol-1 by sorafenib
may account for the extreme sensitivity of these cells to the drug.
cell cycle analysis of sorafenib-treated mv4-11 cells afterpi
staining confirmed the induction of apoptosis with 20.370.5%
of the cells in the sub-g0 compartment at 100 nm sorafenib and
61.770.8% of the cells in the sub-g0 compartment  xxxd1891xxx  mm
(figure 1b). treatment with sorafenib also induced a dosedependent cell cycle arrest with an increase in the percentage of
cells in g0/g1 from 52.770.9% (dmso control) to 66.871.5%
(100 nm inhibitor). a parallel reduction of the percentage of cells
in s phase and g2/m phase was also seen (figure 1b). taken
together, these data indicate that sorafenib inhibits the
proliferation of  xxxg801xxx -driven leukemic cells by inducing cell
cycle arrest and apoptosis.

sorafenib inhibits  xxxg801xxx -wt and –itd-dependent
signaling
the effect of sorafenib on  xxxg801xxx -dependent downstream signaling pathways was investigated in  xxxg801xxx -wt and  xxxg801xxx -itd stably
transfected hek293 cells. tyrosine autophosphorylation in
 xxxg801xxx -wt containing cells was dependent on the addition of
fl, whereas in  xxxg801xxx -itd containing cells  xxxg801xxx  was constitutively phosphorylated (figure 2a). both fl-induced and constitutive autophosphorylated  xxxg801xxx  receptor was inhibited by low

figure 1 induction of apoptosis and cell cycle arrest in  xxxg801xxx -itd leukemic cells treated with sorafenib. (a) cells were treated with sorafenib for
72 h (mv4-11) or 24 h (eol-1). cells were stained with  xxxg166xxx - fitc/pi and analyzed by flow cytometry. (b) mv4-11 cells were treated with
various concentrations of sorafenib for 72 h. cells were fixed in ethanol, stained with pi and analyzed by flow cytometry.

figure 2 sorafenib inhibits  xxxg801xxx -dependent signaling. (a) hek293 cells that were stably transfected with either wild-type  xxxg801xxx  ( xxxg801xxx -wt) or  xxxg801xxx 
with an internal tandem duplication ( xxxg801xxx -itd) were starved and then incubated with various concentrations of sorafenib or dmso for 2 h, after
which they received or did not receive fl.cell lysates were subjected to western blot analysis for phosphorylated (p) or total  xxxg801xxx ,  xxxg1369xxx /2 or  xxxg2216xxx .
(b) cell lysates were subjected to western blot analysis for phosphorylated (p) or total  xxxg801xxx , and  xxxg2216xxx . for phosho- xxxg801xxx  and phospho- xxxg2216xxx 
detection in mv4-11, polyclonal primary antibodies, a secondary biotinylated anti-rabbit immunoglobulin g (igg) and avidin hrp were used for
detection. (c) for eol-1 cells, the same primary phospho- xxxg801xxx  and phospho- xxxg2216xxx  primary antibodies and secondary hrp-conjugated anti-rabbit
igg antibodies were used.

nanomolar concentrations of sorafenib (figure 2a). the effects of
sorafenib on  xxxg801xxx  autophosphorylation was also investigated
using an elisa assay. sorafenib inhibited  xxxg801xxx -itd receptor
tyrosine phosphorylation in a dose-dependent manner following
a 2-h treatment with drug. in three separate experiments, ic50
values ranged from 4 to 8.3 nm, with a mean of 5.5 nm (table 1).
the effect of constitutive and fl-induced phosphorylation of
 xxxg801xxx -itd and  xxxg801xxx -wt respectively on downstream signaling
cascades was also investigated. whole-cell lysates were
immunoblotted with phosphospecific and total  xxxg2216xxx  and
 xxxg1369xxx /2 antibodies. both ligand-induced ( xxxg801xxx -wt) and constitutive ( xxxg801xxx -itd) activation of  xxxg801xxx  led to the phosphorylation of  xxxg2216xxx  and  xxxg1369xxx /2 (figure 2a). both downstream
phosphorylation events were inhibited by low nanomolar
concentrations of sorafenib.
to further characterize the effects of sorafenib on endogenous
 xxxg801xxx -mediated signaling in leukemic cells, mv4-11 and eol-1
cells were treated with increasing concentrations of sorafenib for
2 h, after which time the cells were lysed and the levels of  xxxg801xxx 
and  xxxg2216xxx  phosphorylation were monitored by western blot
analysis. as observed earlier in 293/ xxxg801xxx -itd cells, sorafenib, at
low nanomolar concentrations, inhibited  xxxg801xxx -driven  xxxg1369xxx /2
and  xxxg2216xxx  phosphorylation in both mv4-11 and eol-1 cells
(figure 2b). in eol-1 cells, pdgfralpha autophosphorylation
was also potently inhibited by sorafenib (figure 2c), confirming
that dual inhibition of  xxxg801xxx  and pdgfralpha signaling was
blocked by the drug in this cell line.
leukemia

sorafenib induces regression of subcutaneous  xxxg801xxx -itd
tumors in athymic mice
the antitumor activity of sorafenib was evaluated using an flt3itd subcutaneous tumor xenograft model in athymic mice.
groups of 10 tumor-bearing mice were either left untreated or
treated with vehicle alone or with sorafenib administered orally
at 0.3, 1.0, 3 or 10 mg/kg. the compound was well tolerated
and no significant body weight loss or lethality was observed.
the antitumor activity of sorafenib was dose dependent. the
0.3 mg/kg sorafenib did not produce a significant tumor growth
delay or tumor regressions (figure 3a), whereas at the 1 mg/kg
dose level one out of 10 animals had a complete regression (cr)
and the overall tumor growth delay was approximately
equivalent to the duration of treatment. treatment with 3 or
10 mg/kg resulted in six and nine out of 10 animals with
complete responses, respectively (figure 3a). these results were
confirmed in a second independent experiment (data not
shown).
to further characterize the in vivo biological activity of
sorafenib, mv4-11 tumors were harvested, homogenized and
analyzed by immunoprecipitation/western blot analysis for
phospho- xxxg2216xxx . phosphorylation of  xxxg2216xxx  was completely
abolished in mv4;11 tumors 3 h after the second administration
of sorafenib (figure 3b). the inhibition of  xxxg2216xxx  phosphorylation
in mv4;11 tumors by sorafenib is consistent with the inactivation of  xxxg801xxx  signaling by the drug as  xxxg2216xxx  has been reported to
be the main downstream effector of  xxxg801xxx -itd in vivo.12,13

figure 3 sorafenib induces significant regression of subcutaneous  xxxg801xxx -itd tumor in nude mice. (a) mv4-11 tumors cells (containing  xxxg801xxx -itd
mutation) were implanted subcutaneously in the flank of athymic mice as described in materials and methods. treatment was initiated on day 10
when all mice had tumors ranging in size from 75 to 150 mg. treatment groups were as follows: untreated (k), vehicle (b) and sorafenib tosylate
given orally at 0.3 (’), 1 (j), 3 (n) and 10 (m) mg/kg, q.d.  9. doses are presented as equivalents of sorafenib free-base. (b) mv4;11 tumors
(150–200 mm3; n ¼ 3 mice per group) from control, vehicle-treated or sorafenib-treated (3 and 10 mg/kg) animals were collected as described in
materials and methods. tumor lysates were immunoprecipitated with an anti- xxxg2216xxx  antibody, resolved by sodium  xxxd3215xxx -polyacrylamide
gel electrophoresis , and immunoblots were probed with anti-phospho- xxxg2216xxx  (top panel). membranes were stripped and reprobed with antistat5 for determination of total  xxxg2216xxx  protein (bottom panel). each lane represents a separate tumor. (c) paraffin sections of mv4-11 tumors from
control, vehicle-treated and sorafenib-treated animals (3 and 10 mg/kg) were stained with hematoxylin and eosin and phospho-histone h3.
representative results are shown.

tumors were also analyzed by anti-phospho-histone h3
immunohistochemistry to determine the effects on cell cycle
progression. mv4-11 tumor cells from the untreated or vehicletreated groups stained strongly with phospho-histone h3,
indicating a tumor with a high proliferation index (figure 3c).
tumors from animals treated with sorafenib showed a marked
reduction in phospho-histone h3 staining (figure 3c). these
data are consistent with a potent inhibition of mv4-11 tumor
cell proliferation induced by sorafenib.

discussion
the prognostic significance of  xxxg801xxx -itd mutations in clinical
studies suggests that it plays a important role in aml.14
consistent with a previous report describing high-affinity

binding of sorafenib to  xxxg801xxx -wt,6 we report that sorafenib
can inhibit  xxxg801xxx -itd kinase activity and cell signaling and
demonstrates potent antitumor efficacy in the mv4-11 tumor
xenograft model. sorafenib is among the most potent inhibitors
of  xxxg801xxx -itd kinase described to date. interestingly, sorafenib
was nearly 10 times more potent at inhibiting phosphorylation
of  xxxg801xxx ,  xxxg2216xxx  and  xxxg1369xxx /2 in  xxxg801xxx -itd 293 cells than in flt3wt 293 cells. sorafenib also potently inhibits the enzymatic
activity of  xxxg801xxx  activation loop mutant d835y, suggesting that
this compound may have activity against multiple mutant forms
of  xxxg801xxx , something also supported by our modeling of sorafenib
against  xxxg801xxx  (auclair et al., proc am assoc cancer res, 2005;
46: 1409; 5991). differential sensitivity of wild-type and mutant
forms of  xxxg801xxx  to inhibitors has been reported previously.15 the
selectivity of sorafenib for  xxxg801xxx -itd versus  xxxg801xxx -wt may have
significant implications for therapy given the association of

 xxxg801xxx -itd with disease progression or relapse of aml.14,16 in a
randomized phase i trial of sorafenib in patients with mds or
aml, clinical effects (reduction in peripheral blood and bone
marrow blasts) were seen in 4/27 evaluable patients with one
confirmed complete response lasting three cycles (crump et al. j
clin oncol., 2004; 22: 6611). in that study, biological activity
was assessed in blasts from 14 patients and pathway inhibition
was observed in 5/14 patients. the potential therapeutic role of
sorafenib in aml patient with an  xxxg801xxx -itd mutation is being
addressed in a phase ii follow-up trial.
several small-molecule inhibitors with activity against  xxxg801xxx 
have been recently described (see levis and small17 for a recent
review). each inhibitor has its own spectrum of activity for other
kinases including  xxxg1274xxx , pdgfr, kit and protein kinase c
(pkc). one unique feature of sorafenib compared to other
inhibitors of  xxxg801xxx  is its activity against  xxxg1924xxx . the raf/mek/
erk pathway has been shown to be potentially involved in aml
physiopathology.18,19 in a recent study looking at aml samples
from 42 patients, markedly elevated phospho-erk levels were
found in 83.3% of the aml samples and treatment with a mek
inhibitor resulted in significantly decreased phospho-erk levels,
which was associated with growth arrest but not apoptosis
induction.20 on that last point, other studies on pharmacological inhibition of the ras/raf/mek pathway in aml cells in vitro
have reported conflicting data, with some studies showing
mostly cell cycle arrest without immediate significant induction
of apoptosis in treated cells21,22 whereas other studies have
demonstrated induction of apoptosis.23,24 sorafenib also has
potent activity against kinases reported to potentially be
contributing to aml physiopathology such as pdgfr, kit and
vegfr.25–27 although the selective antiproliferative and proapoptotic effects of sorafenib in  xxxg801xxx -dependent cells versus
 xxxg801xxx -independent cells as well as the potent inhibition of  xxxg2216xxx 
phosphorylation, a major downstream target of  xxxg801xxx -itd,28
argue for  xxxg801xxx  as an important driver of the activities reported, it
is likely that the inhibition of other kinases by sorafenib may also
contribute to the observed antiproliferative effects. it is
noteworthy that mv4-11 cell proliferation was inhibited with
an ic50 of 0.88 nm, 3–5-fold less than the ic50 for inhibition of
 xxxg801xxx . also, the benefits of a multi-kinases inhibitor like
sorafenib are perhaps best illustrated by the activity of sorafenib
in eol-1 cells where inhibition of proliferation and induction of
apoptosis are observed at subnanomolar concentrations of the
drug. it has been reported in a recent study that in primary blasts
(irrespective of their  xxxg801xxx  status) treated with  xxxg801xxx  inhibitors,
induction of cytotoxicity correlated closely with deactivation of
 xxxg2216xxx  and erk and cases were observed where minimal
cytotoxic responses were seen when  xxxg2216xxx  and/or erk activation
persisted despite complete inhibition of  xxxg801xxx .29 given the multifactorial pathogenesis of aml and these emerging data
suggesting that targeted inhibition of  xxxg801xxx  may not, in some
cases, be sufficient in itself to induce cytotoxicity, multi-kinases
inhibitors like sorafenib are therefore attractive agents.
in summary, the demonstration that sorafenib exhibits potent
target inhibition and efficacy in  xxxg801xxx -driven tumors suggests that
this compound may have therapeutic benefit for patients with
 xxxg801xxx -driven leukemias.
