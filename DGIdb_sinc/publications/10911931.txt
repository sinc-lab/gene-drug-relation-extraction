been extraordinarily helpful for both conducting studies to further understand the
addictive diseases, as well as offering many insights into potential appropriate and
effective pharmacotherapies for the addictions. in this context, my presentation
and paper will focus primarily on clinical studies related to the development of
methadone-related opioid agonist pharmacotherapies for heroin addiction, including
the history of the development of methadone maintenance pharmacotherapy, and
also on some recent neurochemical and molecular research findings, as well as comments on the future of opioid agonist and partial agonist pharmacotherapy in mainstream medicine.

introduction
in late 1963, professor vincent p. dole at the rockefeller university decided to
turn his scientific efforts to developing a pharmacotherapy for the management of
heroin addiction. in early 1964, he formed a small team including the late dr. marie
nyswander and dr. mary jeanne kreek, and joined within one year by dr. ann ho
and others. we hypothesized that heroin addiction is a disease of the brain with
behavioral manifestations, and not simply a personality disorder or criminal behavior. the team began to address the specific question of whether a long-acting opioid
agonist could be used in the long-term maintenance treatment of heroin addiction.
although analytical technology was not yet available, a variety of clinical observations had suggested that the synthetic opioid methadone was long acting as well as
orally effective. the 1964 studies documented the ability of methadone, when used
in an appropriately moderate to high dose (now 60 to 150 mg/day), to prevent all narcotic abstinence signs and symptoms, and reduce or prevent drug hunger, and thus
allow rehabilitation efforts. the “narcotic blockade” studies of the spring of 1964
also documented that steady dose methadone treatment, through the mechanism of
tolerance and cross-tolerance, would prevent, in a dose dependent manner, the narcotic-like effects of any superimposed short-acting opiates.
over the next 35 years, innumerable studies documented the safety, efficacy and
effectiveness of methadone pharmacotherapy for heroin addiction. however, in part
because of extraordinarily stringent federal regulations, as well as the stigmatization
of heroin addiction as a disease, adequate access to treatment, as well as adequate
numbers of excellent treatment resources, remains limited. in 1994, the institute of
medicine of the national academy of sciences recommended changes in the federal
regulations to allow increased medicalization of pharmacotherapy for heroin addiction, as well as increased access to treatment. in 1997, a nih consensus conference
was convened, and its report published in 1999 unequivocally supported methadone
maintenance pharmacotherapy for heroin addiction and further recommended
increased access to, and diversification of, sites for treatment, as well as increased
medicalization of treatment. to achieve these goals, in july, 1999, the ondcp
(office of national drug control policy), working in concert with the department
of health and human services, promulgated suggested changes in federal regulations governing methadone maintenance treatment and future pharmacotherapies for
addictions.

two other effective opioid agonist treatments have been developed: the even
longer acting opioid agonist  xxxd2475xxx  (laam) has been approved for
pharmacotherapy for heroin addiction, and still under study is the opioid partial
agonist-antagonist buprenorphine-naloxone combination.
a variety of studies, both laboratory based and basic clinical research, have
revealed the mechanisms of action of long-acting opioid agonists in treatment,
including prevention of disruption of molecular, cellular and physiologic events and,
in fact, allowing normalization of those functions disrupted by chronic use of the
short-acting opiate, heroin. altered stress responsivity, a major dysfunction seen
during cycles of heroin addiction, becomes normalized during steady dose methadone pharmacotherapy. recent molecular biological studies have revealed single
nucleotide polymorphisms of the human µ-opioid receptor gene; the µ opioid receptor is the site of action of heroin, the major opiate drug of abuse, analgesic agents
such as morphine, and the major treatment agents for heroin addiction. all of these
findings support the early hypotheses of our laboratory that addiction may be due to
a combination of genetic, drug-induced and environmental (including behavioral)
factors and also, that atypical stress responsivity may contribute to the acquisition
and persistence of, as well as relapse to, use of addictive drugs.

it is appreciated through various epidemiological studies that around three million
persons in the united states have used heroin at some time. an even much larger
number, around 11 million, have illicitly used off-prescription opioid medications.
it is currently estimated that between 800,000 and one million persons now meet the
definition of heroin or opiate addiction as defined as part of the essential criteria for
entry into opioid agonist treatment for heroin and other opiate addictions, specifically at this time, methadone maintenance treatment and also laam maintenance
treatment. the federal guidelines define heroin (and related opiate) addiction as
specifically one year or more of multiple daily self-administration of illicit opioids
(primarily heroin) with the development of tolerance, physical dependence, and continued use in spite of potential negative consequences to self and others.1
our early treatment research began in the beginning of 1964, with planning in the
autumn of 1963, work conducted under the leadership of professor vincent dole,
who was joined by the late dr. marie nyswander as well as by myself, to conduct
studies on potential pharmacotherapies for heroin addiction. these studies were conducted at the then rockefeller institute for medical research (now the rockefeller
university) and at the rockefeller hospital, and led to the development of methadone maintenance treatment for opiate addiction.1–4
professor dole, having worked with the late dr. lewis thomas on a new york
city health research committee on major health problems, had identified heroin
addiction as the leading health problem of new york city and state, and the nation,
which had not been previously addressed by adequate medical care, clinical research
or related fundamental research. very few laboratories or institutions, with the notable exception of the usphs hospital at lexington, kentucky, were conducting
any rigorous basic or clinical research related to addiction. at that time, heroin

addiction was viewed as primarily a criminal problem, or alternatively, an anti-social
personality disorder, or at best, a personality disorder characterized by “weak-will.”
however, careful scrutiny of the world’s literature at that time taught us that, irrespective of the type of withdrawal from heroin (“cold-turkey” abrupt cessation of
heroin, a practice then and still used in many places, including in criminal detention
and prisons, short or immediate term detoxification using the synthetic opioid methadone, then available in limited centers including bellevue hospital in new york and
usphs hospital in lexington, and either mode of detoxification, coupled with the
most supportive psychiatric and behavioral care, or alternatively, the least supportive
punishment models, led to the same outcome, that is) over 70–90% of heroin addicts
(defined with long-term addiction similar to the later-to-be-developed federal
regulations as cited above) would relapse to illicit opiate use within one to two
years. subsequently, studies over the last 35 years have shown repeatedly that, irrespective of mode of detoxification, now ranging from intermediate to extended term
methadone or buprenorphine-assisted detoxification, with or without adjunctive use
of clonidine, the so-called “ultra-rapid detoxification,” or any other mode, nevertheless have very similar long-term outcomes, with 70–90% of persons returning to
illicit opiate use within one to two years. it was also apparent from scrutiny of the
world’s literature even by 1963-64 that heroin addiction was a problem of all
economic and ethnic groups within the united states and worldwide. we therefore
hypothesized in early 1964 that heroin (opiate) addiction is a disease, a “metabolic”
disease of the brain, with resultant behaviors of “drug hunger” and drug selfadministration, despite potential or actual negative consequences to self and others.
we thus hypothesized that heroin addiction is not a criminal behavior, or due solely
to anti-social personality or some other personality disorder.4
the late marie nyswander had worked with heroin addicts as a psychiatrist at
lexington, at bellevue and in the streets of new york city and was recruited by
dr. dole because of her clinical experience; dr. dole was a clinical and bench scientist studying lipid metabolism and the related disorders of hypertension and obesity; and i (dr. kreek), a resident in training in internal medicine at new york
hospital–cornell medical center, with plans to specialize in neuroendocrine and
brain-gut axis-related research, was recruited for work on this project as a young
clinical investigator, by dr. dole, with the permission of the then-president of the
rockefeller institute, the late dr. detlov bronk, and the head of the rockefeller
hospital at that time, dr. maclyn mccarty.
dr. nyswander insisted that we go out to detoxification centers and the other limited treatment resources, and to the streets in new york city, to observe and understand the problems of heroin addiction. then and now, heroin addiction is
characterized by multiple, daily self-administrations of heroin, a necessity due to the
short-acting properties of heroin, as well as the desire to attempt to first achieve a
euphoria or “high,” and later, simply to prevent the onset of narcotic withdrawal
symptoms or the “sick” phase2–4 (fig . 1). to that end, the heroin addict will selfadminister heroin three to six times every day and, with the increasing development
of tolerance and physical dependence, will use increasing amounts of heroin to
attempt to achieve the euphoria or “high.” we found then (and now) that the heroin
addict will also enter and reenter various detoxification programs in an attempt to
become free from illicit drug use, or alternatively and subsequently, to simply reduce

the level of tolerance and physical dependence. however, with almost inevitable
relapse, with each new cycle of heroin addiction, the development of tolerance and
physical dependence is more rapid, necessitating very promptly the need to use
increasing amounts of this short-acting opiate.
we, therefore, conceptualized that the goals and rationale for specific pharmacotherapy of addiction included:3–5

to prevent opiate abstinence symptoms;
to reduce “drug hunger” or “drug craving” which contributes to and may
lead to relapse;
3. to normalize any physiologic functions, which we proposed and later documented may be disrupted by chronic use of a short-acting drug.
also, the goal of targeting a treatment agent to a specific site of action or receptor,
or to some physiological system which had been altered or deranged by chronic use
of the drug of abuse, in this case by heroin, was discussed in our laboratory even in
1964.5,6 long before the formal elucidation of opiate receptors in 1973, we discussed the probability of the existence of specific opiate receptors, at the time that
similar discussions were going on in a few other laboratories, including those of
martin at lexington and collier in england.5 dole and ingoglia, and later, goldstein,
all conducted studies utilizing a research protocol in which competitive binding by
active and inactive enantiomers of a specific opioid-directed ligand in membrane
homogenate binding assays was used to attempt to elucidate the presence of this
“specific opioid receptor” or binding sites by such receptors.5–8 later, with availability of much higher specific activity radioactive labeled opioid ligands, this same protocol was used and led to essentially the simultaneous discovery by snyder, simon
and terenius of specific opioid receptors in early 1973.9–11
at the beginning of that work, we also wanted to choose a medication which
would be orally effective, have a slow onset of action to prevent any perception of

191

rapid change or opiate-like effect, a long duration of action and a slow offset of
action to prevent any rapid opiate withdrawal.2–4 for heroin addiction, we wanted to
select a medication that would be targeted at the hypothesized opioid receptor. there
were very few orally effective opiate-like analgesic medications, primarily two or
three very short-acting opioid analgesics. however, both marie nyswander, working
as a staff psychiatrist, and myself, as a medical student from columbia college
of physicians and surgeons rotating through the detoxification unit at bellevue
hospital, had observed the effects of the use of methadone in the detoxification management of heroin addiction. methadone, which had been synthesized in germany
by the bayer company and brought to the united states by u.s. health officials,
then had been studied primarily by houde at memorial hospital and beecher at
harvard for potential use in pain management. it had been found by those groups to
be short-acting with respect to relief of acute pain in opioid-naïve subjects. however,
in those studies it was also found that when repeated doses of methadone were given
to opiate-naïve subjects, respiratory depression would ensue, suggesting that some
effects of methadone were long-acting, despite its limited four to six hours effectiveness when used in single doses for the relief of pain. thus, in these early times there
was very limited usage of methadone in the management of acute pain (although in
the past 25 years, it has become widely recognized and used as an excellent agent
for the management of chronic pain).2,3,12,13 a limited numbers of studies had also
been carried out primarily to look at the abuse liability of methadone at usphs hospital in lexington.14 they also characterized methadone as being relatively shortacting when given in single doses, thus leading to the planned and prescribed use of
methadone to be administered four times a day in short term (7 to 14 day) detoxification from heroin addiction. methadone was used in short-term detoxification to a
very limited extent at lexington as well as a few other resources in the united states,
including bellevue. however, dr. nyswander and i had both observed that when the
nursing staff was unable or failed to give the prescribed multiple doses of methadone
each day, that even a single dose of methadone nevertheless prevented or attenuated

the onset of withdrawal symptoms in heroin addicts receiving this short-term detoxification from heroin.
we therefore proposed that methadone might be an appropriate medication to use
in our early research for a pharmacotherapeutic approach to treatment. after the first
four weeks of preliminary research, we proceeded to give methadone in a single
dose, by the oral route of administration, each day to heroin addicts admitted to our
treatment research at the rockefeller hospital.2–4,13 then and now, the initial dose
of methadone administered was 20 to 40 mg a day, to be sure not to exceed the degree
of opioid tolerance and dependence developed by the individual. we then found that
if methadone doses were increased and titrated to an appropriate dose to prevent
withdrawal symptoms during the first weeks of treatment, with careful clinical
observations of each subject, and then further gradually increased at a rate of not to
exceed 10 mg per week up to a final treatment dose of 80 to 120 mg/day, a successful
induction into maintenance treatment would be achieved, with no narcotic-like
effects appreciated by the individual receiving the medication (figure 1). at that
time, there were no analytical technologies available—no gas liquid chromatography, mass spectrometry, radioimmunoassay or other techniques—to use to measure
plasma levels of heroin, morphine or methadone. we had to rely on careful clinical
observations to characterize the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of treatment. however, with these clinical observations, we made the following determinations (see table 1):

whereas heroin had to be administered intravenously to be fully effective,
methadone could indeed be administered orally;
whereas heroin had an immediate onset of action, the onset of orally
administered methadone was slow, beginning at around 30 minutes;
whereas the duration of heroin in preventing opiate withdrawal symptoms
was three to four hours, daily doses of methadone, orally administered,
would prevent the onset of opiate withdrawal for 24 to 36 hours;
and whereas euphoria would be observed during the first one to two hours
after heroin administration, there was no euphoria, and no observation or
sensation experienced by the patient of any opiate-like effects at any time,
when the dose of methadone was carefully selected to reach maximum levels which were consistently less than the degree of tolerance which had
been developed by that individual, (usually achieved by the protocol
above).2–4,13

with those findings forthcoming from our own research in the winter and spring
of 1964, it was reaffirmed that methadone could prevent opiate withdrawal symptoms.2–4,13 it also, however, became clear that “drug hunger” or “drug craving” also
was prevented over a 24-hour dosing interval, and that the thoughts and desires of
the patient turned away from the acquisition and use of heroin, and instead focused
on returning to education, training and/or employment and also, that previously usually disrupted social relations with family and friends began to be re-established.
since it was apparent that a potentially effective pharmacotherapeutic treatment
approach for heroin addiction had been developed, that is, methadone maintenance
treatment utilizing single daily oral doses of the now obviously long-acting opioid,
it was clearly essential to determine whether it would be medically safe to allow
someone to stay on methadone treatment in an out-patient setting, since such
a patient might attempt to achieve euphoria by self-administering heroin. we also
wanted to explore the action and mechanism of action of methadone, with the
hypothesis that methadone might act through the mechanism of the high level of opioid tolerance, and thus cross-tolerance to other opiates developed, and thereby might
protect against not only potentially adverse opioid effects of methadone itself, but
also prevent any perception of purposefully superimposed short-acting narcotics.4
we therefore conducted two series of four-week long, random ordered, latin
square design, double-blinded studies, in which three different short-acting opiates
including heroin, morphine and hydromorphone, methadone itself and saline were
administered in a single, intravenous bolus against a background of daily oral methadone administration.3,4,13 when the code was broken, it became apparent that no
euphoric or other opiate-like effect was observed by the clinical investigators, or perceived objectively or subjectively by the research subject following the superimposed administration of any of the short-acting opiates or methadone. only a “pins
and needles” sensation had been reported (when the code was broken) after each
morphine administration on the blinded basis, but with no subsequent or expected
euphoria, “high” or other opiate-like effects. this led the study subjects to ask, after
the double-blinded morphine administration and the resultant “pins and needles”
sensation, “where is the rush?” and “where is the high?” no changes in respiratory
rate, or any other vital signs, or any other potential adverse effects were observed. a
third and final set of single-blinded studies were conducted where increasing doses
of heroin were superimposed against a background of daily oral methadone administration.4 these studies showed that heroin, in amounts up to 200 mg per intravenous bolus, could not be perceived by the individual maintained on 100 mg/day of
methadone, with no perception of any opiate-like effect, and only with amounts of
heroin of 200 mg or more were any narcotic-like effects perceived or observed.4
these studies taught that it would be safe to have a person receive daily methadone
treatment even if they should attempt to try to achieve a euphoria or “high” with a
superimposition of a short-acting opiate like heroin.these studies became of
extreme importance since subsequently it was found that around 50% or more of persons who are receiving methadone treatment will attempt to use heroin at least once.
the medical safety with respect to any potential additive adverse effects was also
documented by these studies.
however, the fact that very large doses of heroin (200 mg or more) could exceed
the degree of tolerance and cross-tolerance achieved by methadone treatment, with

194

annals new york academy of sciences

usual doses (80 to 120 mg/day), was documented by these studies. this observation,
in retrospect, showed that there was an ample “opioid receptor reserve,” that is,
unoccupied opioid receptors. the presence of unoccupied opioid receptors was to
become extremely important in later studies which showed that physiological systems dependent on activation of the µ opioid receptor system and disrupted during
cycles of abuse of the short-acting opiate heroin could become normalized during
methadone maintenance treatment.3,5,12–15 these early observations have now been
documented in our recent ongoing studies conducted in both healthy volunteer subjects and in stabilized methadone maintained former heroin addicts using positron
emission tomography. in these recent studies we have shown that only 25 to 35% of
opiate receptors in each brain area are occupied during steady dose methadone maintenance treatment.15 finally, and possibly most importantly, these studies also
showed that no “priming” effect of a short-acting opiate, that is, no potential modest
opiate effect leading to relapse to illicit heroin use, was achieved by superimposition
of small to moderately high doses of the short-acting opiate heroin, doses which heroin addicts might use on the street, since all euphoric and reinforcing effects of such
amounts of heroin were “blocked” and prevented by the level of tolerance and crosstolerance that had been achieved by the daily dose of the long-acting opioid
methadone.
these findings of these studies have very important implications in the setting of
the recent change in the purity of heroin, at least in the northeast segment of the
united states. since the purity of heroin has recently soared from the usual 5 to 30%,
to over 70% in the areas of new york, new jersey, pennsylvania and increasing
regions beyond, it has become essential to use even larger doses of methadone in the
treatment of heroin addiction, both because the levels of tolerance and physical
dependence of persons entering treatment are greater and also to protect, through the
mechanism of tolerance and cross-tolerance, the potential priming and euphorigenic
effects of any superimposed, increasingly pure, short-acting heroin.
thus, these early studies showed that medication with daily oral adequate doses
of methadone, then 80 to 120 mg/day in most subjects, subsequently shown to be 60
to 120 mg/day in many subjects and most recently, shown to be 80 to 150 mg/day in
most subjects, would prevent any onset of opiate withdrawal symptoms over a
24-hour dosing interval; would also significantly reduce or eliminate “drug hunger”
or “drug craving”; would not contribute to any adverse effects if short-acting opiates
were superimposed, thus with a very high therapeutic index of safety because of tolerance and cross-tolerance; and finally, would offer the additional therapeutic advantage of two different mechanisms of action, first due to steady-state perfusion of
specific opioid receptors, with prevention of abstinence and reduction of an elimination of drug craving, and a second mechanism, due to classical conditioning and
deconditioning phenomena which could ultimately lead to the extinction of any use
of heroin superimposed against the background of methadone treatment, since no
euphoric effects would be perceived.
by 1972 two different groups had developed techniques using gas liquid chromatography to quantitatively measure plasma levels of methadone, as well as later
heroin and morphine, in blood, as well as in urine.16–18 in these studies, it was found
that the half-life of  xxxd2587xxx  in humans as used in the chronic treatment
of addiction was 24 hours (fig . 2). in later studies using gas chromatography-

kreek: methadone treatment for heroin addiction

195

chemical ionization mass spectrometry with selective ion monitoring, and with different stable isotope labeling of the two enantiomers or methadone, carried out by
our group in collaboration with the group of klein, then at the argonne national
laboratories, we found that the active r-enantiomer of methadone has a half-life of
over 36 hours, whereas the inactive s-enantiomer has a half-life of only 16 to 20
hours.19–22 also, in our studies we learned that methadone has an over 90% systemic
bioavailability after oral administration.18–22 in contrast, the group of inturrisi
showed that the half-life of heroin was three minutes in humans; its 6-acetylmorphine metabolite, 30 minutes; and its major metabolite, morphine, 4 to 6 hours
in humans.23these findings confirmed our clinical observations. also, they further
supported the concepts that have been derived from many studies both in animal
models and in humans, that the rates of rise of blood levels, and presumably, levels
in specific brain sites of action, of drugs of abuse are related positively to the reinforcing effects. also, rates of fall of blood and presumably brain sites of action levels
of drugs of abuse are related to the onset of signs and symptoms of withdrawal (if
these are to occur) and also to the onset of “drug craving” and “drug hunger.”2,3
another opioid agonist which began to be developed in 1980 by jaffe, schuster,
senay and colleagues is l-alpha-acteylmethadol (laam) and which, many years later, in 1994, was finally approved as an alternative medication for use in the opioid agonist pharmacotherapy for heroin addiction. laam has an even longer half-life than
methadone.14,24,25 the parent compound, laam, has a half-life of over two days,
and its nor- and dinor-laam metabolites have half-lives of two and four days,
respectively.14,24,25 in contrast with methadone, which is metabolized primarily by
n-demethylation to biologically inactive compounds, laam is metabolized to two
biologically active compounds which have similar effectiveness as the parent compound of laam itself.14,24,25 several medications have been found to have significant interactions altering the pharmacological effectiveness of methadone.26−34 early
discoveries included the significant interactions of the anti-tuberculosis agent,
rifampin, and the anti-convulsant agent, phenytoin, with methadone, both of which
accelerate its biotransformation, resulting in lower plasma levels for dose of methadone administered and will result in the onset of mild to modest withdrawal symptoms if the dose of methadone is not adjusted upward and also, preferably, with
divided doses.26–34 another notable demonstrated agent which has an important
interaction with methadone is ethanol, which has a bimodal interaction, that is, inhibition of methadone biotransformation when very high blood levels of ethanol are
present, followed by acceleration of biotransformation of methadone after ethanol has
cleared in those who were regular, heavy consumers of ethanol and thus, have
enhanced activity of p-450-related hepatic drug metabolizing enzymes.28,29,33 other
drug interactions with methadone have also been recently elucidated, including some
interactions in which methadone may alter the biotransformation of a second agent
used to treat hiv-1 infection with more interactions probably to be elucidated with
specific agents used in triple therapy treatment of aids.
there are currently 179,000 persons in methadone maintenance treatment in the
united states and approximately an equal number abroad. the voluntary retention
in treatment in “good” programs, which use adequate doses of methadone and have
on - site counseling and access to medical and psychiatric care as needed, range from
60 to 85%, with the same results pertaining since the mid 1960s.1,3,13,14,35,36 also,

196

annals new york academy of sciences

in such well-run programs which combine the important components of effective
methadone pharmacotherapy with counseling and medical care, continuing use of
illicit opiates drops to less than 20% in one year. we have recently completed a
prospective study of all heroin addicts entering a well-run methadone program over
a four year period and again, have reconfirmed these findings.
in summary, it has been established that the actions of methadone include preventing withdrawal symptoms and eliminating or reducing “drug hunger” or “drug
craving.” also, it has been found in our studies and others that studies of adequate
dose methadone treatment will block the euphoric effects of superimposed shortacting narcotics in doses similar to those commonly used on the streets. however,
with the increasing purity of heroin, increasing doses of methadone may be needed
both to manage the level of tolerance and dependence, as well as to protect, through
the mechanism of tolerance and cross-tolerance, the perception of any superimposed
short-acting opiate. we also now know that methadone acts by providing steadystate levels of the synthetic opioid at specific receptors, now elucidated to be specifically the µ opioid receptor site.2,12,14,35
the relative effectiveness of various approaches of treatment of opiate addiction
have been assessed in numerous different papers. methadone maintenance treatment, when carried out with adequate doses of medication and access to counseling,
as well as to medical and psychiatric care as needed, leads to a voluntary, one-year
retention of 60 to 80% in unselected persons, with very significant reduction of illicit
opiate use from 100% of persons entering treatment who are using multiple doses of
heroin each day, to less than 20% of persons using any heroin, within one
year.2,12,14,35–48 in contrast, treatment with the narcotic antagonist, naltrexone, has
been relatively unsuccessful, except in special treatment groups who have no access
to alternative treatment, such as probationers or medical personnel in states that do
not allow methadone maintenance treatment.37 in numerous, well-controlled studies, naltrexone antagonist treatment of opiate addiction in unselected patient populations, and with no severe contingency contracting, less than 20% will remain in
opioid antagonist treatment for 6 months or more.37 diverse varieties of abstinencebased, “drug-free,” non-pharmacotherapeutic approaches to treatment of long-term
heroin addiction, as defined by the federal regulations, have been ineffective in the
majority of unselected heroin addicts; only 5 to 30% of long-term heroin addicts
respond to abstinence-based treatment, irrespective to the type of detoxification preceding such treatment. also, short-term detoxification treatment itself of any mode
has been shown to lead to continuing sustained abstinence in less than 20% of unselected patients when appropriate follow-up studies with face-to-face interviews and
urine monitoring have been conducted.
two other pharmacotherapies have been shown to be very effective in long-term
treatment of heroin addiction, as defined. one is an opioid agonist pharmacotherapy
using the longer acting  xxxd2475xxx  (laam).14,24,25 the second, which
is still experimental in the united states, is an approach using the long-acting (by
virtue of sustained receptor occupancy, not pharmacokinetic profile) partial opioid
agonist, buprenorphine, which, when combined with the specific opioid antagonist,
naloxone, which has very limited systemic bioavailability, (less than 2% when
administered by an oral route), but which will prevent any parenteral abuse of
buprenorphine, has been shown to be effective in the management of heroin addic-

tion, especially when doses equivalent to only moderate to low doses of methadone
(40 to 60 mg per day) are needed. this therapeutic approach has not yet been
approved by the fda as of the autumn of 1999 (and spring of 2000), but approval
is anticipated in the near future.3,13,14,37
prospective studies to determine the safety, efficacy and effectiveness were conducted from the beginning of our clinical research of the potential use of methadone
in pharmacotherapy for heroin addiction.41–48 every person receiving one dose or
more of methadone was included in these studies.41–43 in these studies it was shown
that in addition to being effective, methadone was medically safe as used in moderate to high doses in the chronic management of heroin addiction. the only side effect
which persisted in the three year prospective study of all persons entering treatment
research with methadone was increased perspiration, but which was also not shown
to interfere with any type of work activity or physical exertion.42,43 more recent
studies have rigorously evaluated at a follow-up of a random group of subjects in
methadone treatment continuously for ten years or more.46 in these studies, it was
shown that the only disorders which were more common in the methadone maintained population as contrasted to age and years of addiction matched untreated heroin addicts were three disorders commonly found in sedentary, middle-aged
americans: adult onset diabetes mellitus, obesity, and radiologically diagnosed hiatus hernia. in contrast, in the heroin-addicted populations, problems related to continued heroin addiction included cutaneous ulcers, skin infections, bacterial
endocarditis, burns, and gunshot wounds were far more common.46 similarly, the
continued drug abuse patterns were elucidated in this group of long-term methadone
maintained patients as contrasted with a matched group of long-term parenteral heroin addicts. it was found that whereas only 13% of long-term methadone-maintained
patients met the criteria for alcohol abuse, over 64% of continuing heroin addicts
did, and whereas only 17% met the criteria of continuing cocaine use, over 88% of
the continuing heroin addicts were chronic cocaine users or addicts.46
as part of our ongoing surveillance and research into other disorders and diseases
prevalent in the untreated heroin-addicted population, with or without persistence
during methadone-maintenance treatment, we conducted very early studies on aids
infection, the first to elucidate and track the arrival of the hiv-1 epidemic among
parenteral drug users in new york city, just after the disease was first elucidated
and while it was still referred to as lav, before the redesignation as hiv-1 and
aids.49–55 in 1983 in collaboration with the centers for disease control, utilizing
their initial attempted tests for hiv-1 infection, which were ineffective, and then,
using their first effective test to detect antibodies of hiv-1, and by studying blood
specimens which we had prospectively banked from 1969 onward from persons
coming in for neurobiological and treatment research, we elucidated that hiv-1
infection entered the parenteral drug abusing population in new york city around
1978 (with subsequent extensive studies showing a very limited number of cases
from 1975 to 1978).49,50,53 we also found that the hiv-1 prevalent in the untreated
parenteral drug abusers rose rapidly so that by 1981-82 over 50% were hiv-1 positive.49 in further studies conducted by des jarlais and colleagues, this 50–60% prevalence of hiv-1 infection in untreated drug users in new york city persisted until
1992 when, with over 7 years of aggressive aids risk reduction education and measures, new cases of hiv-1 infection began to be reduced.49–55 as part of these same

198

annals new york academy of sciences

studies we found that at a time in 1983-84 when over 50% of parenteral drug abusers
(primarily heroin addicts) in new york city tested positive for hiv-1 antibodies,
only 9% of those former heroin addicts who had entered into and remained in methadone maintenance treatment from 1978 onward were hiv positive.49 further early
studies from our group in the 1980s and subsequently by others confirmed the very
positive impact of methadone-maintenance treatment in preventing exposure to and
infection with the aids virus.50,51,54 we found also that concomitant cocaine use by
heroin addicts increased the risk of aids virus infection.52 our original findings,
with their enormous implications for public health and aids prevention, led us to
publish our results immediately in the cdc weekly report in july of 1984, a publication which unfortunately went unheeded for many years both in the united states
and abroad.49 to attempt to further emphasize the need for enhancing effective treatment for heroin addiction at that time, we also published a paper in the world health
organization bulletin in 1986.51 this did have some modest impact in europe
where, soon after that time, the hiv-1 epidemic was finally recognized.54
other diseases which have been found to be very prevalent in heroin addicts from
the beginning of our research include hepatitis b, which, at the beginning of our prospective studies in 1964, and with the subsequent elucidation of the hepatitis b virus
and development of specific markers to test for hepatitis b infection in 1967, was
found to be present with markers of current or previous infection in over 90% of
untreated heroin addicts in the new york city area coming into and during methadone maintenance treatment in the 1960s through the mid-1980s.41–45,51,55–64 however, with aggressive aids risk reduction education and other measures in new york
city, the prevalence of hepatitis b has dropped steadily since 1985 so that now only
around 30 to 40% entering methadone maintenance treatment have any markers
indicating former or active hepatitis b infection or are hiv-1 positive.63
with the discovery of hepatitis c virus as the major “non-a/non-b” hepatitis
virus in 1989, we were able to go back and again study sera collected from 1978
onward; we found that hepatitis c was present in over 90% of those heroin addicts
with liver disease coming into or in treatment.65 again, recently, hepatitis c prevalence in untreated heroin addicts has begun to fall, but still remains present in over
50% in the new york city area intravenous drug–abusing population entering treatment. hepatitis delta was a problem for many years in those heroin addicts and
former heroin addicts in treatment who had hepatitis b antigenemia, or had had antigenemia in the past and later cleared hepatitis b virus antigen, but had persistent
delta-agent infection.55,61 however, in the last 8 to 10 years, infection with delta
agent, an rna viroid-like agent which requires replicating hepatitis b virus for its
own infectivity, has essentially disappeared in the drug abusing population in the
new york city area.
because of the decline in persons with hepatitis b markers, but the continuing
potential risk for hepatitis b infection in active and former heroin addicts, hepatitis b
vaccination was studied to determine whether methadone-maintained patients would
be compliant with the three injection vaccination protocol, and also whether they
would be able to mount an adequate immune response to such vaccination.63 this was
of especial importance given the fact that many studies, including those from our own
laboratory, have shown that in heroin addicts, many specific components of immune
function are severely compromised, including especially natural killer cell activity,

kreek: methadone treatment for heroin addiction

199

which is profoundly reduced in active heroin addicts.64 however, our studies had
shown that during methadone-maintenance treatment there is a steady and continuing
improvement, with eventual normalization of these specific components of immune
function, including normalization of natural killer cell activity, possibly accounting
for the brisk clearance of hepatitis b antigenemia in former heroin addicts in methadone maintenance treatment, with usual appearance of the protective hepatitis b surface antibodies.63,64 we have hypothesized that the response to the hepatitis b
vaccination would be normal in methadone-maintained patients.63,64 in fact, our studies have shown that methadone-maintained patients are both compliant with the vaccination protocol and mount an adequate, protective immune response.63 thus
vaccination for hepatitis b, as well as identification and treatment of active hepatitis
b (antigenemia with demonstration of dna virus and with liver dysfunction) as well
as active hepatitis c (demonstration of hepatitis c virus rna and documentation of
liver dysfunction) should be considered and usually carried out in former heroin
addicts in treatment (as well as not in treatment, if possible).42,43, 55,56,63–65
numerous studies have shown that the psychiatric co-morbidity in heroin addicts
when coming into treatment commonly occurs, in 20 to 50% of persons, and with
anxiety, depression and anti-social personality as the most commonly recognized comorbid conditions. in a recent studies from our clinic populations, we have found
that the most common psychiatric co-morbid problem are phobic disorders, primarily social phobia which may be considered a subset of anxiety disorders.66 this is
followed by depressive disorders, anxiety disorders and anti-social personality disorders, each occurring in 30 to 50% of our population under study.66
over 15 years ago (and subsequently repeated since) we proposed that there
should be a cascade of diverse resources for offering methadone-maintenance treatment.2,3,12,35 given the public health issues which we had unearthed by that time,
and the documentation of highly significantly reduced prevalence of hiv-1 infection
in former heroin addicts in methadone maintenance treatment, we had proposed
“holding clinics” to allow all heroin addicts seeking treatment to come immediately
into methadone (or alternative) opioid agonist pharmacotherapy, and then, as space
permitted, enter “full-services” methadone-maintenance treatment programs. we
then suggested that after two years or more in conventional methadone-maintenance
treatment programs, persons who are doing well in treatment, with no continuing
illicit drug use or heavy alcohol abuse, should be allowed to progress to a “medical
maintenance” paradigm, that is, methadone pharmacotherapy in a physician’s officeor in a hospital-based setting, and with pharmacies providing the medication, and
with counseling and speciality medical and other psychiatric care available on referral, but not on an on-site basis, along with continuing access to return to full-services
methadone programs if needed. we also recommended that specialty programs
be developed for those with diseases or situations requiring special services or care,
such as terminal illnesses or aging, and finally, that medication clinics be developed
for daily pharmacotherapy administration, but without full-services methadone
program access, for those with persistent unresponsiveness to counseling and behavioral care after five years or more in conventional programs.
one of these novel, yet generally unavailable, resources which our own group acted on was medical maintenance. under ind-fda 15 years ago, david novick in
our group, working with the late dr. marie nyswander and myself, systematically

200

annals new york academy of sciences

developed a medical maintenance program which continues to be conducted with
success and evaluated rigorously, initially by dr. d. novick and subsequently by his
successor, dr. e. salsitz.67–70 the first “medical maintenance” criteria for entry into
this program were very stringent: five years of sustained success in conventional
methadone-maintenance program with no continued drug or alcohol abuse, and
social and/or occupational rehabilitation.67 the continued successes of this medical
maintenance program, where patients come once every four weeks to a physician’s
office, have been documented by prospective and continuing evaluation. methadone
is dispensed by a specific, designated pharmacy for up to four week intervals after
the patients are seen by their private physician in the physician’s office. it is quite
clear that further medicalization of methadone treatment is needed at this time.1,67–71
in the early 1990s, a series of meetings were held leading to a report of the institute of medicine of the national academy of sciences which strongly recommended
reducing the long-standing criteria for entry into opiate-agonist pharmacotherapy,
primarily methadone maintenance, but also laam maintenance by that time. the
recommended adjustment would be to consider an individual a heroin “addict” if
there has been 6 months or more (rather than one year or more) of daily multiple selfadministrations of heroin (or other short-acting opiate, used illicitly) with potential
harm to self and others, the current inclusion criteria for entry into methadone- (or
laam-) maintenance treatment.1 this was based on increasing information of the
natural history of those heroin addicts not in treatment, those in abstinence-based
treatment, and those in effective pharmacotherapy. also, the major part of that report
was to strongly recommend the federal guidelines be changed to allow “medicalization” of treatment, including physician- and office-based treatment, as well as to
allow decision-making to be on a medical basis, rather than based on regulations.
in november of 1997, an nih consensus conference was convened by dr.
harold varmus, director of the national institute of health, and dr. alan leshner,
director of national institute on drug abuse. following the usual nih consensus
conference format, after listening to extensive reports by scientists, as well as criminal justice, regulatory affairs, public health and policy officials, and followed by a
rigorous deliberation by the consensus panel, a report was presented, issued on-line
and published in 1999 which unequivocally endorsed methadone-maintenance and
related opioid agonist (and when, approved, partial opioid agonist) pharmacotherapy
for opiate addiction.71 this report also strongly recommended increasing and diversifying the sites of access to treatment, increasing medicalization, in general, of
treatment, and allowing such sites as physicians’ offices and hospital-based clinics,
as well as special addiction clinics to be credentialed and to allow to offer agonist
pharmacotherapy treatment as appropriate.71
we have formulated several related hypotheses on the vulnerability to develop
and the molecular neurobiological basis for addictions and have postulated a prominent, and potentially central, role of the endogenous opioid system in this vulnerability and neurobiological basis for addictions. in the early 1980s, we proposed that
there were three domains of factors, which contribute to vulnerability to develop
addictions:
1.

genetic factors, probably involving specific alleles of multiple genes, may
act in concert to enhance or reduce vulnerability to develop specific addictions;

kreek: methadone treatment for heroin addiction

2.

3.

secondly, we hypothesized that drugs of abuse may alter physiology, and
specific molecular, neurochemical and cell biological components thereof,
and;
thirdly, we hypothesized that variable host responses to drug self-exposure
would occur, depending on a variety of factors including early developmental changes, environmental factors, physiological and psychological
status, including the role of “set and setting,” as well as the presence of
other diseases, and especially responses to stress and stressors.

we also hypothesized that the endogenous opioid system might be involved in each
of these domains of factors and thus, be intrinsically involved in the molecular neurobiological basis of heroin addiction, and also of cocaine addiction and alcoholism,
two other addictive diseases under rigorous study in our laboratory for several
years.3,5,12,13,35,38,39
it is now known that the endogenous opioid system has at least three classes of
endogenous opioids—the endorphins, the enkephalins and the dynorphins, each of
which has been found to have a single gene coding for a single, large peptide which
in turn is processed to yield several biologically active peptides, including, in the
case of the enkephalins and dynorphins, several opioid peptides, and in the case of
proopiomelanacortin (pomc), both  xxxg1801xxx  and acth, as well as other neurobiologically active peptides. also, there have been found to be three types of opiate
receptors, µ, delta, and kappa; although these were clearly delineated by increasingly selective synthetic chemical ligands, it was not until 1992 that the first of these endogenous opioid receptor genes were cloned. now it has been found that there are three
(and to date, only three) genes each coding for one receptor, µ, delta, or  xxxg1633xxx . a fourth class of endogenous opioids, the endomorphins, two different small
four amino acid residue compounds, have been identified and yet their parent peptide
and the gene coding for these peptides have yet to be elucidated.
studies from many laboratories have shown that heroin and other short-acting
opiates such as morphine acts primarily on the opioid system, binding at the µ-opioid
receptor. however, these short-acting opiates also affect the dopaminergic system
through disinhibition of the gabaergic normal inhibitory control of dopamine
release, an action primarily centered at the ventral tegmental area. cocaine acts primarily on the dopaminergic as well as on the serotonergic and noradrenergic system.
it acts by binding at the monoamine reuptake transporters at presynaptic sites, resulting in increased accumulation of each of these neurotransmitters in the perisynaptic
region. we hypothesized, and our group and many others now have shown, that
cocaine profoundly affects specific components of the endogenous opioid system. it
has now been shown that alcohol, which is both a stimulant and a depressant, acts at
both the opioid and also at the monoaminergic, as well as other classical neurotransmitter systems.
in the early 1960s we also hypothesized that an atypical responsivity to stress and
stressors may contribute to the vulnerability to develop addictions. this led us, in our
earliest prospective studies initiated in 1964, to include specific static and provocative tests of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (hpa) axis function, one of the
major components of the stress responsive system in humans, and one which can be
studied by sampling peripheral fluids including blood and urine. we hypothesized

202

annals new york academy of sciences

specifically that atypical responsivity to stress and stressors may contribute to the
persistence of and relapse to self-administration of drugs of abuse and addiction and
that, moreover, such atypical responsivity to stressors may actually exist in some
individuals prior to the use of addictive drugs and lead to the acquisition of drug
addiction. in turn, we hypothesized that genetic and environmental and direct drug
effects may play a role in this intrinsic or acquired atypical stress responsivity.
the hpa axis component of stress responsivity may simply be characterized in
humans as being driven primarily by the production of  xxxg517xxx 
(crf) in the hypothalamus, which then drives the anterior pituitary to produce and
process the  xxxg1801xxx  (pomc) peptides, which results in increased levels
of acth and  xxxg1801xxx  in peripheral blood; acth then acts at the adrenal cortex in humans to produce the glucocorticoid, cortisol, (and in rat and mouse models,
to produce the glucocorticoid, corticosterone). it has been well documented over
several years, in human as well as in animal studies, that these glucocorticoids, cortisol and corticosterone, act in a negative feedback mode both at the hypothalamic
site to decrease crf production and release, and at the anterior pituitary site to
decrease the production and release of pomc and its constituent peptides.
using a modified solution hybridization rnase protection assay, with increased
sensitivity and specificity, developed in our laboratory, we have gone back to study
the molecular events of regulation of the hpa axis genes by both glucocorticoids and
by crf. in these studies, zhou in our laboratory found that the synthetic glucocorticoid, dexamethasone, modulates by decreasing crh mrna levels in the hypothalamus, but with no effect of this glucocorticoid on crf mrna levels in other regions
of the brain which may be extremely important in different aspects of stress responsivity and which may be involved in a variety of affective, as well as addictive disorders.72 thus, no effects of glucocorticoid on crf mrna levels were found in the
frontal cortex, the amygdala or the brain stem.72 zhou went on to study the effects
of both dexamethasone and crf itself on the crf-r1 type receptor levels in several
brain regions where the message for this gene is expressed. he found that in the
anterior pituitary, dexamethasone significantly reduces crf-r1 mrna levels, but
with no effect, in the neurointermediate lobe of the pituitary nor in the olfactory
bulb, the amygdala or in the frontal cortex.72 zhou also studied effects of dexamethasone and crf on pomc mrna levels in the rat. he found that the glucocorticoid,
as previously determined from studies of peptide levels, reduced pomc mrna levels in both the anterior pituitary as well as in the neurointermediate lobe, but had no
effect on pomc mrna levels in either the hypothalamus or the amygdala.72 in contrast, crf administration enhanced pomc mrna levels in the anterior pituitary,
but had no effect on pomc levels in the neurointermediate lobe, in the hypothalamus or in the amygdala.72,73 as anticipated, dexamethasone reduced plasma corticosterone levels, and crf enhanced plasma corticosterone levels in the rat, similar
to findings previously made by many different investigative groups.72
zhou went on to study the effects of the synthetic,  xxxg1635xxx -directed
opioid methadone which is long-acting in man, but unfortunately, is short-acting in
the rodent, including rat and mouse.73 we have found that the plasma terminal halflives of methadone in the rat and mouse are 90 and 60 minutes respectively, as contrasted with over 24 hours in humans.74,75 therefore, zhou administered methadone
by pump to achieve levels similar to those achieved during maintenance treatment of

kreek: methadone treatment for heroin addiction

203

heroin addiction; he found that methadone administrated in this “steady-state” manner brought about no alterations in gene expression, that is, no changes in quantitatively measured mrna levels of crf, crf-r1 receptor or pomc, and no changes
in peripheral hormone levels. in sharp contrast, zhou has recently shown that intermittent morphine administration in the rodent (which has the opposite effects in
rodents with respect to the effects of acute administration of short-acting opiates in
man) significantly alters levels of expression of these genes and their peptides.76
on the basis of our early prospective studies in heroin addicts entering methadone
maintenance treatment, both during induction into treatment while methadone dose
escalation was going on and following stabilization in treatment, we reported several
very intriguing findings which supported our hypothesis of derangement of the hpa
portion of the stress responsive axis during cycles of heroin addiction, and normalization during methadone maintenance treatment.2,3,5,13,35,41,43–45,77–91 first, we found
during cycles of heroin addiction there was a flattened circadian rhythm of levels of
glucocorticoids.2,3,41,43–45,77–91 subsequent studies have shown that in both addicts,
and non-addicts receiving short acting opioids, e.g., for pain management, there is a
suppression of the hpa axis, with lowered levels of both acth, as well as cortisol.77–80 conversely, we found that during opiate withdrawal, there is activation of
this axis with increased levels of glucocorticoids.77–80 later, with the advent of
assays for the pomc-derived peptides, we also found increased levels of acth and
 xxxg1801xxx  in opiate withdrawal.81–84,86–91 however, during steady-state methadone treatment we found that there was normalization of both plasma levels and the
circadian rhythm of levels of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal part of the stress
responsive axis, including normal levels and circadian rhythm of plasma levels of
acth and  xxxg1801xxx , both derived from pomc and normal plasma levels of circadian rhythm of levels of cortisol from the adrenal cortex.77–85 thus, the “on-off”
effects of short-acting opiates caused the disruption of this aspect of not only levels
of gene expression and receptor-mediated events, but also the hormones themselves,
thus disrupting the physiology of the hpa axis (see table 1).
further studies from my laboratory by culpepper-morgan as well as studies carried out in collaboration with rosen and kosten at yale university have shown that
activation of the hp part of the hpa axis actually precedes the onset of withdrawal
symptoms, rather than following the onset of objective and subjective signs withdrawal.92,94–96 thus, the previously formulated concept of activation of the stress
responsive axis during the setting of the stress of opiate withdrawal, that is, the
activation thought to be a response to the actual physical and emotional stress of
withdrawal itself, may not be entirely correct, since more recent findings suggest that
activation of this hpa axis may actually precede and thus, help to precipitate the
onset and drive the signs and symptoms of opiate withdrawal.92,94–96 in a very provocative set of studies, kennedy in our group found that when activation of the hp
part of the hpa axis is brought about by  xxxd2633xxx  challenge (see below) with
resultant increased levels of crf and in turn (and directly measured) increased plasma levels of acth and  xxxg1801xxx , well-stabilized former heroin addicts in methadone-maintenance treatment thought that they were going into opiate withdrawal,
but the signs and symptoms of opiate withdrawal were milder than those of actual
withdrawal and were very short-lived.85 there was no lowering of methadone plasma levels and no displacement of methadone from the µ-opioid receptors. thus, in

204

annals new york academy of sciences

the setting of  xxxd2633xxx  challenge, and the resultant enhanced processing and
release of pomc peptides, there was either release of a yet-to-be-identified opioid
antagonist, or alternatively, and more.likely, a “cueing” phenomena due to increased
levels of crf, acth and  xxxg1801xxx , perceived by the research subject in methadone treatment and interpreted as “endogenous cues” that they were going into opiate withdrawal; however, there was a rapid reversal of this phenomenon during the
 xxxd2633xxx  test itself, despite the fact that acth and  xxxg1801xxx  levels remained
elevated.85
extending the very early findings of volavka et al., our group and others have
studied the effects of opioid antagonists in both healthy humans and those with specific addictive disease disorders.86–103 like volavka, we have found that in normal
healthy volunteers, specific opioid antagonists have a profound effect on the hpa axis.91,98–101 when an opioid antagonist is administered, the endogenous opioids
should be prevented from actions at specific opioid receptors at hypothalamic and
pituitary sites. therefore, only the tonic, negative inhibitory modulation by glucocorticoids is left to modulate release of crf and, in turn, the release of the pomc
peptides,  xxxg1801xxx  and acth. thus, a defined increase in levels of peripherally
circulating  xxxg1801xxx  and acth and, in turn, of cortisol should result. there are
three opioid antagonists which have been introduced and approved for use in
humans: (1) naloxone, which has minimal (1–2%) systemic bioavailability after oral
administration, a one to two hour half-life in humans, and which is metabolized primarily by the route of glucuronidation; (2). the second, naltrexone, which has a
moderate (30 to 40%) systemic bioavailability after oral administration, a half-life
in humans of five to six hours, and is metabolized by oxidative metabolism; and
(3) nalmefene, which has moderate systemic bioavailability (60 to 70%) after oral
administration, a longer half-life of eight to nine hours, and is metabolized primarily
by glucuronidation.86,87,90,91,93,98 two of these, naloxone and nalmefene, have been
approved by the united states food and drug administration for the reversal of
anesthesia-related, or accidental or purposeful opioid overdose. naltrexone has been
introduced and approved for the adjunctive management of opiate addiction and,
under a different trade name, also for the management of chronic alcoholism. these
three opioid antagonists have been shown to have different binding affinities at specific opioid receptors in human membranes.102 naloxone, nalmefene and naltrexone
all bind primarily at the mu human opioid receptor. however, both nalmefene and
naltrexone, but not naloxone, have high binding affinity for kappa opioid receptors,
whereas naloxone does not.98,102 all three have very low binding affinity to delta opioid
receptors in human membranes.102
schluger in our laboratory performed a series of studies in normal healthy volunteers in which two doses of naloxone, a high dose (10 mg in a bolus) and a very high
dose (30 mg in a bolus) and in a parallel set of studies, two doses of nalmefene, a
high dose (10 mg in a bolus) and a very high dose (30 mg in a bolus) were each given
on two different days by the intravenous route of administration to normal healthy
volunteers, as well as one day of placebo administration.98 both doses of naloxone,
10 and 30 mg, gave a similar level of activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary axis,
as measured by plasma acth levels from the pomc peptide, and by plasma cortisol
levels. the two doses of nalmefene also gave similar activation of the hpa axis measured by plasma acth and cortisol levels. however, the nalmefene activation of the

kreek: methadone treatment for heroin addiction

205

hpa axis was significantly greater than the activation by naloxone.98 these findings
in normal healthy volunteers suggest that endogenous opioid ligands, probably primarily dynorphins, directed at the  xxxg1633xxx  are playing a role in the tonic
inhibition of the hp part of the hpa axis, in addition to the endogenous ligands primarily, probably  xxxg1801xxx ,  xxxg1801xxx -arg-phe,  xxxg1801xxx  and possibly endomorphins, directed at the µ opioid receptor.
in summary, our studies have now shown that modulation of release of the
hypothalamus–pituitary neuropeptides, crf and the pomc-derived acth and
 xxxg1801xxx  in humans is under tonic negative feedback inhibition by glucocorticoids, specifically cortisol in humans (and corticosterone in rats and mice), but in
addition, is under tonic inhibitory control by the endogenous opioids acting at kappa,
as well as at µ-opioid receptors. this implicates the possible primary role of
 xxxg1801xxx  and meta-enkephalin-arg-phe acting at the µ receptor and dynorphin
a1–17 peptides acting at the kappa-opioid receptor.98
in another series of studies initially conducted from 1967 to 1973, in our first
studies addressing our hypothesis about the role of altered stress responsivity in the
addictive diseases, and in several more recent studies, we have used a  xxxd2633xxx 
challenge to probe the integrity and responsivity of the hp part of the hpa
axis.2,3,5,12,13,38,41–45,77,78,83,85,103  xxxd2633xxx  is a compound which in humans
blocks the final step of cortisol synthesis, 11 beta-hydroxylation, and thus removes the
normal tonic inhibition of the hypothalamic and pituitary part of the stress responsive axis by cortisol. in the early tests which we carried out in the 1960s and 1970s,
multiple doses of  xxxd2633xxx  were given over a 24-hour period and then the urinary
levels of the precursors of cortisol were measured over a 72-hour period. in a more
recent test, which we began to use when radioimmunoassay analytical techniques
were available for direct measurement of acth and  xxxg1801xxx  in peripheral plasma, a single dose of  xxxd2633xxx  is administered and multiple time points are taken
over an 8 hour period to determine the responsivity of the hp part of the hpa axis
to this chemical “stressor.” in each case, there is defined activation in normal healthy
volunteers. when  xxxd2633xxx  is administered, plasma cortisol levels drop to close
to zero levels, significantly below baseline (unlike in the rodent models where
 xxxd2633xxx  only prevents stress-induced increases in glucocorticoid levels, but simply maintains glucocorticoid levels at baseline). with the precipitous drop over 30
minutes to one hour of cortisol levels, after the single  xxxd2633xxx  test dose, there is
a surge of release of crf and in turn of the pomc peptides, acth and  xxxg1801xxx .
these elevations persist for two to eight hours and then return to baseline. in our earlier studies, we found that in heroin addiction, there is a hyporesponsivity to this
 xxxd2633xxx  induced chemical stress.77–80 in other studies we found that during the
first one to three months of induction into methadone maintenance treatment, at a
time when the dose of methadone is gradually being elevated, there is still a lower
than normal response showing relative inadequate hypothalamic pituitary reserve in
the former heroin addicts entering methadone maintenance treatment.41,43–45 however, after three months or more of steady dose methadone maintenance treatment,
normalization of the responses to this stress-induced  xxxd2633xxx  challenge occurred
and was sustained during chronic maintenance treatment.41,43–45,83,85 these findings suggest that there is a greater than normal modulation of the hp component of
the hpa stress responsive axis by the exogenous opiates itself during cycles of her-

oin addiction, when the short-acting opioid heroin is being self-administered, as well
as during methadone induction, when full adaptation and tolerance is being developed to the effects of this long-acting synthetic opioid. however, new homeostasis
is achieved after stabilization in moderate to high dose methadone maintenance
treatment. 2,3,5,12,13,35,38,39,43,44,78,81,83,85
very provocatively, we found, reported in 1984, and continue to find that in medication-free, illicit opiate-free and other drug free former heroin addicts, a hyperresponsivity to the  xxxd2633xxx -induced stressor is seen.3,5,13,35,83 when we first
described this in the 1980s, there was no precedent for hyperresponsivity to any
 xxxd2633xxx  challenge.3,5,13,35,83 although a novel finding without precedent in
1984, subsequently, other workers have found such a hyperresponsivity in small subgroups of depressed patients. in a sub-group of the very few former heroin addicts
who are able to stay free of any drug abuse and without pharmacotherapy with an
opioid agonist (or antagonist), this hyperresponsivity has been observed to persist in
most, but not all, subjects studied. most former long-term heroin addicts not receiving pharmacotherapy relapse in a short period of time, initially to licit drug or alcohol use and then, to illicit opiate use, or alternatively, (and far preferably), return to
methadone (or laam or burpenorphine-naloxone) maintenance treatment because
of appropriate fear of or actual relapse.
in the late 1980s we made the observation, which we have recently reconfirmed,
that in recently abstinent cocaine addicts, a similar hyperresponsivity to the
 xxxd2633xxx  induced stress pertains, and that this persists for several weeks or
months after achieving cocaine abstinence.35,103
in summary of this area of our work on the role of atypical stress responsivity in
the acquisition, persistence of and relapse to addictions, a hypothesis that led us in
our earliest studies in the mid 1960s to include measurements of plasma levels and
circadian pattern of levels of hormones of the hpa axis; to conduct  xxxd2633xxx  challenge tests to determine integrity of the hp part of the axis; as well as to conduct dexamethasone suppression tests, which showed that all heroin addicts and all
methadone maintenance patients entering and in treatment, responded normally to
dexamethasone suppression despite a very high prevalence of depression (which
may yield a status of inability to suppress the hp part of the hpa axis with dexamethasone), we found that our hypothesis was supported. during cycles of heroin
addiction there are lower than normal plasma levels of hormones of the hpa axis;
flattened circadian rhythm of those levels; and a hyporesponsivity due to the
 xxxd2633xxx  challenge. in contrast, we found that at a time when behaviors become
normalized, and drug hunger and drug craving is significantly reduced or eliminated,
along with a concomitant reduction or elimination of illicit heroin (and other opiate)
use, in most (over 80%) persons receiving effective methadone treatment with adequate doses, there is normalization of plasma levels of hormones of the hpa axis;
normal circadian rhythm of those levels; and normal response to chemically-induced
stress using  xxxd2633xxx . at the same time, further studies showed that in drug-free,
medication-free former heroin addicts, there is also a hyperresponsivity to the chemically-induced stressor, a hyperresponsivity that might or might not pertain in the
setting of environmental or emotional stress and which would be reversed by selfadministration of a short-acting opiate such as heroin, thus, possibly contributing to
relapse.

we have hypothesized that in cocaine addicts, and in alcoholics, there may be
actually a desire for stimulation or “stress seeking” component to the addictive disease behavior, that is, the cocaine addict and the alcoholic may be seeking the activation of the hpa axis, along with possible activation of other parts of the brain
stress responsive and also reward systems involving crf, pomc peptides, the opioid system, other neuropeptides such as orphanin and cholecystokinin and the classical neurotransmitters including dopamine, serotonin and norepinephrine. studies
from our group as well as from others have shown that both alcohol (in the ascending
limb of blood alcohol levels) and cocaine, on an acute and chronic basis, in both
humans as well as in animal models, activate the hpa axis. some long-term alcoholics and cocaine-dependent individuals may have a lower than normal basal level of
activation of the hpa axis. in contrast, based on our very early hypothesis and findings, we suggest that the heroin addict is looking for the opposite, that is, a
suppression of their own atypical, endogenous (genetic or early environmentally
induced) or drug-induced hyper-responsivity to stress and stressors, which with
administration of a short-acting opioid such as heroin could be reversed to a suppression of the hpa axis. clearly, appropriate treatment, such as that achieved by opioid
agonist pharmacotherapy using the long-acting synthetic opioid methadone for heroin addiction, allows normalization of the measurable components of the stress
responsive systems with normal responsivity, rather than hyper- or hyporesponsivity
to stress or stressors. however, during the early induction period, methadone, like
heroin, yields a modest suppression of this axis, which may in fact be critical during
the induction with gradual restoration to the normal state.
it is provocative that naltrexone and nalmefene have both been shown to be effective in the intermediate term (up to 6 months) management of 30 to 50% unselected
alcoholics, and that these antagonists, like alcohol itself, activate the hpa axis. thus,
this activation may, in fact, contribute to the therapeutic efficacy of opioid antagonist
in the management of alcoholism. in sharp contrast, use of the opioid antagonist naltrexone has been singularly unsuccessful in the treatment of unselected long-term
heroin addicts, with many studies showing that less than 15% of unselected heroin
addicts will stay in treatment with naltrexone for more than one year and with more
favorable responses seen only in those with no options for treatment and severe consequences if any relapse occurs (e.g., health care personnel in some states enigmatically not allowing opioid-agonist treatment, or parolees in municipalities similarly
not allowing opioid-agoinst treatment).1,37,71,88,89,99 this may in part be due to the
activation of the hpa axis caused by acute or chronic administration of opioid
antagonists.3,15,13,37,39,86–89 we have shown in a study of the longest-term naltrexone treated heroin addicts available for study participation, with our collaborators at
yale university, kosten and kleber, that activation of the hpa axis persists after
every dose of naltrexone administered in persons in treatment with naltrexone for
heroin addiction for 15 weeks or more; subjects in longer-term naltrexone treatment
were not available for study because of the rapid and high dropout rate.88,89 intriguingly, we have found that in methadone maintained patients who are not yet experiencing opioid withdrawal in the mornings before the usual daily dose, there is an
elevation of  xxxg1801xxx  levels in csf, but not in plasma, suggesting the possible
onset of “sub-clinical” opioid withdrawal.84 in other more recent studies culpeppermorgan has documented the hpa axis supersensitivity to naloxone in opioid  xxxd2870xxx -

208

dency and, in fact, her findings, along with other subsequent findings conducted in
collaboration with rosen and kosten at yale university have shown that the activation of the hpa axis actually precedes, and not follows, the onset of opiate withdrawal symptoms.94–96 these findings, coupled with those (discussed earlier) from
kennedy in our group, in which  xxxd2633xxx  induced transient, but moderate to
severe, withdrawal symptoms in well-stabilized methadone maintained patients
(which we postulate may be due to the “cueing” effects of elevated levels of crf
and pomc peptides in these well-stabilized persons, but elevations which in such
study subjects might be reminiscent of the onset of opiate withdrawal experienced
during cycles of heroin addiction), again, support the hypothesis of the role of activation of the stress responsive hpa axis (which is modulated in part by the endogenous opioid system, and which by the opiate addict is interpreted as “unpleasant” or
dysphoric), in both endogenous cueing leading to “drug hunger” and thus, to drugseeking behavior and self-administration in the heroin addict, or even possibly the
former heroin addict in treatment. thus, we propose that for some addicts, there is
“stress or exhilaration seeking behavior,” for instance, in the alcoholic and cocaine
addicts, and for others, there is “stress minimizing or calmness seeking behavior,”
that is, in the heroin addicts. in either case, the opioid system, including both the µand kappa-opioid systems, interactive with other neuropeptides and neurotransmitters,
undoubtedly play a role in not only the molecular neurobiology, but also the behaviors of addiction.
we have hypothesized that since the µ-opioid receptor is the primary site of
action of several endogenous opioid peptides, and also, a major target of opioid
analgesic agents and a major drug of abuse (heroin), that potentially important single
nucleotide polymorphisms (snp’s) may exist for the µ-opioid receptor gene in
humans. these, with or without functional consequences, could serve as markers for
the studies of the genetic basis of addiction; and if present within the coding region,
could result in the amino acid residue changes that might in turn alter receptor function.104 dr. lei yu and his group, then at the university of indiana and now at the
university of cincinnati, and our group decided in early 1994 to write a grant proposal to determine whether or not there were snp’s within the coding region of the
µ-opioid receptor gene, as a first start in asking what we consider to be an extremely
important question: do individual differences in opioid receptors exist which may
alter function, that is, both the binding and activity, of either some endogenous or
exogenous opioid? recognition of the need to identify specific snp’s and other
polymorphisms, along with our hypothesis and proposal concerning the possible role
of snp’s in variability to endogenous components of normal physiology, either in
the response to exogenous agents, or also, possible altered responsivity to endogenous compounds as specifically related to the neurobiology of addictive diseases,
was in fact formulated several years before the major need to identify snp’s was recognized by others.104 the human genome project at the nih only since late 1997, as
well as many outside not-for-profit and for-profit human genome sequencing groups,
identified the need for the determination of not only a single human genome, but of
multiple, different genomes, with now wide recognition of the fact that polymorphisms may lead to functional consequences, either through direct alteration of the
resultant peptides or to alteration of levels of gene expression of those peptides,
which might be important for human disorders. the term “pharmacogenomics” has

kreek: methadone treatment for heroin addiction

209

been coined and refers to differences in response to pharmacotherapeutic agents on
a genetic basis. we have recently coined the word “physiogenomics” to refer to any
possible differences in responses to endogenous substances due either to altered receptors, ligands, signal transduction mechanisms, or other amplification mechanisms due to the existence of snp’s or other polymorphisms.13,105,106
in our studies begun in 1994 in collaboration with the group of lei yu, and
first reported in 1998, we identified five snp’s in the coding region of the human
µ-opioid receptor gene.104 one of these had recently been the only polymorphism
identified by another research group, and a second one of these had been the only
common allele identified by a third independent research group.107,108 in our initial
studies in human µ-opioid receptor gene, we found that three of the five snp’s in the
coding region lead to amino acid changes, whereas the other two are silent.104,105
moreover, we found that two of the three snp’s resulting in amino acid changes had
very high allelic frequency of 10.5% for the a118g variant and 6.6% for the c17t
variant.104,105 this means that approximately one in five persons carry at least one
copy of the a118g variant and one in eight carry one copy of the c17t variant. in
collaboration with the statistical genetics group of jurg ott with suzanne leal, we
then conducted association studies with our initial study cohort of 152 subjects,
including normal healthy volunteers and long-term heroin addicts meeting the criteria of the federal guidelines for entry into methadone maintenance (at least one year
of daily self-administration of an illicit opiate, primarily heroin, with the development of tolerance and physical dependence and drug-seeking behavior, despite possible adverse consequences to self and others).104,105 in those association studies, we
found that the c17t variant came close to, but did not reach, significant levels
(p = 0.054) for association with opioid dependence.104 very similar findings were
reported by the group of berrettini and again, not reaching significant levels (with
a p level of just over 0.05).107 with respect to the a118g variant, we found no
association with opiate dependency or lack thereof, when all ethnicities were
considered.104,105 however, with respect to the ethnic group with the largest numbers in our study, the hispanic group, primarily of dominican republic and puerto
rican origin, we found an association with the lack of opiate dependency.104 these
findings, which may due simply to an admixture of population, might, however, suggest some protective contribution by the a118g variant.
since the most frequent of the allelic variants or snp’s found was the a118g
variant, and since the location of this variant at a site of putative glycosylation, we
elected to select this variant for our first rigorous binding and functional studies.104
in studies conducted with dr. yu and dr. judith strong, it was found that, whereas
the a118g variant bound all exogeneous ligands studied, including methadone,
fentanyl and morphine, similarly to the prototypic receptor, and also bound most
endogenous ligands, including  xxxg1801xxx , dynorphin and the endomorphin
similarly,  xxxg1801xxx  which is the longest (31 amino acid residues) and with the
longest half-life of the endogenous opioid peptides, as well as the most widespread
with respect to its production and which also circulates in peripheral blood, was
found to bind three-fold more tightly to the a118g variant than to the prototype in
appropriate cellular constructs.104 in further studies conducted by judith strong with
lei yu and colleagues, we found that one of the two most important single transduction systems of the  xxxg1635xxx , the g-protein coupled inwardly rectifying

210

annals new york academy of sciences

potassium currents (girk’s) were similar after binding of exogenous opioid ligands,
as well as short-length endogenous opioid ligands, to the a118g variant, as contrasted with the prototypic µ-opioid receptor gene. however, again, using appropriate
cell constructs, we found that when  xxxg1801xxx  bound to the a118g variant µopioid receptor, there was a three-fold greater activation of the girk’s.104 thus,
both binding and activation by  xxxg1801xxx  acting at the a118g variant was greater
than binding and activation by  xxxg1801xxx  at the usual or prototypic µ-opioid
receptor. the findings of alterations at the a118g variant suggests the possibility
that in all the diverse physiologic systems in which  xxxg1801xxx  is intrinsically
involved, including stress responsivity, endogenous response to pain, modulation of
pulsatile lh release, gastrointestinal function and immune function may be altered,
possibly enhanced, when  xxxg1801xxx  binds to the a118g variant. further studies
will be essential to determine whether this hypothesis is correct.105 studies are currently in progress to determine the binding and functional consequences of the c17t
variant.
because of the potential importance of each of these very common snp’s, in
human physiology and pathological disorders, in collaboration with the group of
mirzabekov at the argonne national laboratory, we have been developing a custom
gel pad oligonucleotide microarray for the µ-opioid receptor system.105,106 using
this gel pad microarray, we can identify the a118g and c17t snp’s of the µ-opioid
receptor present in heterozygote or homozygote individuals with greater throughput
and equal fidelity to automated or hand gel sequencing.105,106
in summary, historically, in 1964 we started our research by addressing a major
medical and public health problem, and developed a very effective pharmacotherapy
for heroin addiction, that is, methadone-maintenance treatment, the efficacy and
effectiveness of which has been repeatedly documented over the past 35 years and
which remains an enduring and important pharmacotherapy for addiction. in parallel
with this developmental, there has been the developmental of two other opioid agonist pharmacotherapies, the full opioid µ-opioid agonist, laam, and the partial
agonist buprenorphine-naloxone (which is rendered safe from parenteral drug abuse
when combined with the antagonist naloxone). our group and many others have also
gone on to learn a great deal about the neurochemistry, molecular biology, receptor
function and related behaviors of opiate addiction, both through animal models, as
well as from basic and applied clinical research studies. in 1994 with the group of
lei yu we began our studies of single nucleotide polymorphisms of the human
µ-opioid receptor including identification of snp’s association analyses and studies
of binding and activity.104,105 very recently and encouragingly, the elegant epidemiological work of the group of ming tsuang in which heroin addiction was shown to
have an even greater genetic component than other addictions with respect to relative
risk in rigorous epidemiological-type twin studies. we have gone on to initiate studies of both the human molecular genetics of addiction, as well as further studies
of potential roles of polymorphisms including snp’s within the coding region, or
in the promoter regions and other sites within the genes in individual
responsivity.105,106 our studies were initiated with the µ-opioid receptor and will be
continued and extended to the study of many other genes to determine their possible
role in functional differences, both for “pharmacogenomics” and “physiogenomics.”
we also have initiated family studies which will be used to attempt to identify new

211

genes, as well as to determine the relevance of known genes, in the human molecular
genetic basis of addiction, specifically heroin addiction.
