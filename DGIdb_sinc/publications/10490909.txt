 xxxd2957xxx  suppresses serotonergic neuronal activity and does not block the inhibition of serotonergic neurons produced by 8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylam...  clinical studies have shown that  xxxd2957xxx  can enhance the effects of antidepressant drugs, presumably by acting as an antagonist at somatodendritic 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-ht)(1a) autoreceptors, which regulate the firing rate of central serotonergic neurons. the current study characterized the action of  xxxd2957xxx  on the single-unit activity of serotonergic neurons in the dorsal raphe nucleus of freely moving cats. (+/-)- xxxd2957xxx  produced a dose-dependent inhibition of neuronal activity after i.v. (ed(50) = 0.25 mg/kg) and s.c. (ed(50) = 1.23 mg/kg) administration. the active enantiomer (-)- xxxd2957xxx  (1 mg/kg i.v.) also suppressed neuronal activity (maximal decrease, 88%). upon p.o. administration, (+/-)- xxxd2957xxx  (10 mg/kg) produced a marked, long-acting suppression of neuronal activity similar to that observed after s.c. administration. in all cases, the reduction in firing rate produced by  xxxd2957xxx  was completely reversed by low doses of n-[2-[4-(2-methoxyphenyl)-1-piperazinyl]-ethyl]-n-(2-pyridinyl)cycloh exanecarboxamide (way-100635) (0.1 mg/kg i.v. or 0.2 mg/kg s.c.), a selective 5-ht(1a) antagonist. systemic administration of (-)-tertatolol (1-5 mg/kg i.v.), another beta-adrenoceptor blocker/putative 5-ht(1a) antagonist, had no significant effect on neuronal activity. the ability of i.v. (+/-)- xxxd2957xxx  (0.1-1 mg/kg) to reverse the suppression of serotonergic neuronal activity produced by 8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin (8-oh-dpat) (10 microg/kg i.v.), a selective 5-ht(1a) agonist, also was examined. (+/-)- xxxd2957xxx  had no appreciable effect on the action of 8-oh-dpat. in contrast, the 5-ht(1a) antagonist drugs way-100635 (0.1 mg/kg i.v. ), 4-fluoro-n-[2-[4-(2-methoxyphenyl)-1-piperazinyl]ethyl]-n-2-pyridinyl benzamide (0.1 mg/kg, i.v.), n-tert-butyl-3-(4-(2-methoxyphenyl) xxxd2960xxx -1-yl)-2-phenylprop anamid e [(s)-way-100135] (0.5 mg/kg i.v.), and (-)-tertatolol (1-5 mg/kg i. v.) reversed the effect of 8-oh-dpat to varying degrees. overall, these results indicate that  xxxd2957xxx  acts as an agonist rather than an antagonist at 5-ht(1a) autoreceptors in awake animals.
