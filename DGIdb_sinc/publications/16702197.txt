anti-rankl therapy—implications for the bone-vascular-axis in ckd?
 xxxd1833xxx  in post-menopausal women with low bone mineral density*

less than a decade ago substantial changes in our
understanding of bone metabolism emerged by the
discovery of the outstanding importance of the
 xxxg2299xxx  (opg)–receptor activator of nuclear
factor-kb (rank)—rank ligand (rankl) system
for bone cell regulatory processes. the opg–rank–
rankl axis is the biochemical correlate for the wellknown ‘coupling’ in bone remodelling: a strongly
linked interplay between continuously ongoing bone
degradation and bone formation—in other words
between osteoblastic and osteoclastic activity [1,2].
in this locally active, triangular system, rankl
exerts the action of an osteoclastic activator, enhancing
both differentiation as well as functional status of
osteoclasts and hence increasing bone resorptive
activity. in contrast,  xxxg2299xxx  (nomen est
omen) functions as a soluble decoy receptor for
rankl and thus antagonizes rankl action with
the net effect of bone resorption inhibition.
preservation of the rankl-to-opg balance is of
critical importance for bone remodelling and preservation of bone mass.
the importance of the opg–rank–rankl
system may extend to vascular health [3]. opgdeficient mice develop both premature and severe
osteoporosis as well as arterial calcifications in the
aorta and renal arteries, predominantly occurring in
the medial layer of these vessels [4]. transgenic

treatment,  xxxd1682xxx   xxxd2019xxx  toxicity) [6] also revealed a
combined vasculo- and osteoprotective role of opg.
maintenance of bone mineralization and prevention
of vascular calcification are obviously closely linked.
epidemiological studies have clearly shown that
patients with osteoporosis are prone to vascular
calcification and vice versa [7].
is a safe and effective pharmaceutical influence of
the human opg–rank–rankl system feasible?
a very recent publication says ‘yes’.
in a february issue of the new england journal of
medicine, mcclung and colleagues [8] report a phase 2
study of the efficacy of various doses of  xxxd1833xxx 
for treatment of post-menopausal osteopenia and
osteoporosis.  xxxd1833xxx  is a neutralizing human
monoclonal antibody to rankl, mimicking the
biological function of opg. in a cohort of 412 postmenopausal women with low bone density, the efficacy
of seven different dosing regimens of  xxxd1833xxx  were
tested compared with placebo and a standard dose of the
bisphosphonate alendronate, respectively.  xxxd1833xxx 
was administered intermittently either every 3 or
every 6 months. the antibody strongly inhibited
bone resorption as judged by up to 88% reduction in
the levels of serum c-telopeptide, with a rapid onset
of action 3 days after administration and with
a sustained, but reversible antiresorptive effect. at
1 year,  xxxd1833xxx  treatment significantly increased
bone mineral density, especially in the lumbar spine
(þ3.0 to þ6.7%) and to a minor extent in the total hip
and the distal radius. these changes due to  xxxd1833xxx 
treatment were at least comparable and somewhat
superior to those induced by alendronate and revealed
dose-dependency. apart from the established increment of dyspepsia during bisphosphonate treatment,
no significant differences in adverse events were
observed between the treatment groups. in summary,
the report by mcclung added a promising and
presumably safe antiresorptive agent to the currently
available drug armatorium for the treatment of osteopenia and osteoporosis in post-menopausal women.
what are the potential implications for patient-care
in nephrology? can we regard  xxxd1833xxx  as a ‘magic

the second reason for speculating rather cautiously
about the potential of  xxxd1833xxx  treatment in esrd
is the unclear role of opg in human vascular disease.
quite unexpectedly, serum levels of the presumed
calcification inhibitor opg correlated directly, and not
inversely, with the severity of vascular disease in the
normal population and with the magnitude of vascular
calcification in an esrd cohort, respectively [21,22].
the issue of whether high serum opg levels in patients
with vascular disease reflect counter-regulation and
an endogenous defence effort, or in contrast a driving
pro-calcificatory force of opg in humans is still
unresolved [3]. it is noteworthy that high opg, as
well as low rankl, serum levels were recently found
to be independently linked to increased mortality in
esrd patients [23]. however, to make matters worse
and even more complex, the relative risk association
between opg serum levels and mortality appeared
to be u-shaped in a subgroup of inflamed dialysis
patients (crp >10mg/l) [23].
in conclusion, there is a rapidly growing understanding of the complex interplay concerning the
regulation of bone formation as orchestrated by
a number of bone regulatory proteins, e.g. opg,
rankl, the wnt-pathway, bone morphogenetic
proteins, and others. ckd significantly and specifically contributes to a disequilibrium of bone turnover,
even with consequences leading to vascular pathology
[24]. at this time, the potential of antagonizing
rankl in post-menopausal osteoporosis can be
regarded as a major therapeutic breakthrough and as
a biology-based cause-and-effect-related approach.
there is as well stimulating hope that the availability
of  xxxd1833xxx  as a novel treatment tool may find its
place and use in the spectrum of bone and vascular
disease in ckd, but it is too early to oversee all the
consequences of such an approach.

bullet’ for our end-stage renal disease (esrd) patients,
of whom the majority display a reduced bone mineral
density [9] with concomitantly increased fracture rates
[10] and with an excess of cardiovascular calcification
and mortality burden [11]?
regrettably, it is as yet not guaranteed, if such
a magic bullet will hit its target. first, renal osteodystrophy and the affiliated demineralization in chronic
kidney disease (ckd) is a broad spectrum of disease
conditions with two extreme variants warranting
special attention: (1) adynamic bone disease (abd),
i.e. low-turnover bone disease, and (2) osteitis fibrosa,
i.e. high-turnover bone disease as the histological
equivalent of renal hyperparathyroidism (hpt) [12].
it is a noteworthy fact that abd has been continuously catching up with hpt in the last decade in terms
of prevalence in esrd patients [13].
in states of high-turnover bone disease with characteristically increased bone resorption—in other
words with a disequilibrium in the rankl–opg
balance in favour of the former factor— xxxd1833xxx 
treatment may probably be of value to rapidly suppress
osteoclast mediated bone-resorption for a prolonged
period of time. indeed, it has recently been shown in
a rat model of renal insufficiency and hyperparathyroidism that opg administration diminishes pth
action on bone [14]. moreover, as underscored by
the small decreases of serum calcium levels in
 xxxd1833xxx -treated subjects [8], additive  xxxd1833xxx 
administration for treatment of severe secondary
hyperparathyroidism may diminish the risk of hypercalcaemia with concomitant calcitriol therapy—
although this clearly remains to be proven. a similar
approach has been described for the combination of
calcitriol and the anti-osteoclastic, anti-resorptive
agent  xxxd2837xxx  [15].
on the other hand, abd is characterized histopathologically by a diminished cellular activity of
both osteoblasts and osteoclasts and is suspected to be
related to increased fracture and mortality rates [16].
as demonstrated by mcclung et al. [8],  xxxd1833xxx 
treatment is presumably associated not only with a
decrease in osteoclast activity, but also with a
subsequent decrement in osteoblast activity as judged
by diminished bone-specific alkaline phosphatase
serum levels. thus,  xxxd1833xxx  bears the risk of
aggravating abd by further reducing bone remodelling activity. the hazard of over-depression of bone
metabolism is supported by findings of coco and
colleagues [17] who discovered very low bone turnover
in renal transplant recipients treated with  xxxd2837xxx .
the association of reduced osteoblastic surfaces in
bone histomorphometry accompanied by enhanced
vascular calcification further underscores a potential
causal link between low bone turnover and cardiovascular morbidity in haemodialysis patients [18].
conflicting results have been published regarding
serum levels of circulating opg in dialysis patients
with low-turnover bone disease compared with those
with high-turnover bone disease [19,20].
