summary

gamma-vinyl
gaba (gvg, vigabatrin), an irreversible inhibitor of gaba
transaminase ( xxxg8xxx ) that inhibits cocaine-induced
place preference and self
administration has been proposed as a treatment for cocaine addiction. it was therefore
important to assess if there was an enhanced toxicity from the combination of gvg
with cocaine. no mortality was observed with administration of gvg (60 mg/kg iv)
alone (n=g) or in combination (n=6) with cocaine (5 mg/kg iv). cocaine-induced
ekg alterations were not affected by gvg pretreatment. plasma alanine amino
transferase activity was reduced by gvg treatment and this was not further modified
by cocaine administration. these results suggest that acute co-administration of gvg
and cocaine does not result in immediate cardiovascular or hepatic toxicity of sufficient
significance, to preclude further clinical trials.

gaba by inhibiting the gaba catabolizing enzyme  xxxg8xxx

biochemical and behavioral effects. using microdialysis techniques we have demonstrated the
effectiveness of gvg in attenuating cocaine-induced increases in nucleus accumbens dopamine release
(2). gvg has also been shown to dose-dependently attenuate cocaine-induced dopamine release in the
corpus suiatum at doses that do not produce sedative effects (3). furthermore, we have shown that

abolished both the expression and acquisition of cocaine-induced conditioned place preference (cpp)
in rodents, without affecting cpp for a food reward, the delivery of cocaine to the brain or locomotor
activity (4). these findings indicate that selective increase of gabaergic tone attenuates
cocaine-induced dopamine release without the apparent side effects typically associated with sedative
hypnotics and have led us to propose that targeting brain gabaergic systems is a potentially effective
pharmacologic treatment strategy for cocaine addiction. furthermore, use of gvg is advantageous
due to its prolonged inhibitory effects on the enzyme, resulting in elevated endogenous gaba levels
without the addictive liability associated with gaba agonists acting directly at the receptor site (i.e.
benzodiazepines).
clinical experience with gvg (vigabatrin@) has been accumulated mainly in europe, where the drug
has been licensed in several countries since 1989 (5). reports of studies spanning more than 5 years
of more than 1,100 patients with epilepsy indicate that gvg is a very potent antiepileptic drug which
is well tolerated in humans (6). however, gvg has not been approved by the fda because of visual
field constriction and blurring reported following chronic gvg therapy (7). currently, human trials
with gvg are being developed to directly examine the utility of this novel strategy for the treatment
of cocaine addiction. although the long-term goal of this treatment would be to decrease cocaine use;
during the initial phases of treatment, the possibility of cocaine use during gvg treatment could be
high. because of the inherent toxic effects of cocaine, gvg treatment could result in enhanced cardiac
and/or hepatic toxicity. thus, the aim of the present study was to determine whether acute gvg and
cocaine co-administration results in overt hepato- and/or cardiotoxicity.
methods
animalpreparation:
all animal studies were conducted in strict accordance with the nih guidelines
for the care and use of laboratory animals and approved by the institutional animal care
committee. male sprague-dawley rats (325-350 g bw, taconic farms, germantown, ny) were
housed in a controlled environment, exposed to a 12: 12 h light-dark cycle and fed a standard rat diet
(purina rat chow, ralston purina, st. louis, mo) for one week before being used in an experiment.
on the day before the experiment, animals were anesthetized with an intramuscular injection of
ketamine (9 mg/loo g) and xylazine (0.9 mg/loo g). using aseptic surgical techniques, a catheter
(pe-50) was implanted in the left carotid artery, and advanced to the arch of the aorta, and another
catheter placed in the right jugular vein as previously described by our laboratory (8,9).
electrocardiographic (ekg) electrodes (insulated 26 awg copper wire) were sutured to the anterior
chest musculature over the superior aspect of the right hemithorax and over the superior and inferior
aspects of the left hemithorax. leads were then tunneled out through the inter-scapular region. after
surgery, the animals were returned to individual cages, fasted overnight and provided water ad-libitum.
experiments were started between 0800 and 0900 h the following day, with rats conscious and
unrestrained throughout the duration of the protocol. animals were kept in a quiet environment in
plexiglass cages to allow for observation of their behavioral responses. the animals were not handled
at all during the experimental procedures. the carotid catheter was connected through a three-way
stopcock to a pressure transducer for monitoring arterial blood pressure and the ekg leads connected
to an ekg monitor (detailed below). basal arterial blood pressure, baseline ekg recordings, and
baseline blood samples were obtained prior to injecting the gvg. animals (5-6 per group) were
injected intravenously (2 ml) with gvg 60 mg/kg or saline. three hours later, mean arterial blood
pressure, ekg, heart rate were recorded and an additional blood sample was collected prior to
intravenous injection of 5 mg/kg cocaine (pre-cocaine). this time-frame was chosen in order to use
a similar protocol as that used for microdialysis studies of cocaine-induced dopamine release from the
nucleus accumbens. hemodynamic parameters were monitored during cocaine injection and for the
following 15 min.

cardiac and hemodynamic status: rats were implanted with ekg leads 24 hours prior to the
protocol. the leads were attached to an ekg monitor (sirecust 404, siemens medical systems,
englewood, co) and ekg monitored continuously on lead ii from just prior to the gvg injection and
up until 5 min after cocaine administration.
blood pressure was measured using the same monitor
(sirecust 404) attached to the carotid catheter. blood pressure was determined prior to drug
administration and during the following 15 min. heart rate was determined by counting qrs
complexes over a given time period using the ekg trace obtained prior to and during cocaine
administration as well as at 1, 5 10 and 15 min later.
because vigabatrin has been
plasma alanine amino transferase activity and lactate concentrations:
reported to result in marked decreases in plasma  xxxg941xxx  (ala-t) activity (lo), blood
samples were collected for enzymatic determination of alt activity (sigma diagnostics, st louis,
mo). blood lactate levels were assessed as an additional measure of possible interaction of gvg and
cocaine on hepatic intermediary metabolism. a 0.5 ml sample of blood was deproteinized with 4%
perchloric acid (pca; 1:3 vol/vol) and the supematant collected was stored at -20” c for later
enzymatic assay of blood lactate (11) using a technicon autoanalyzer.
statistical analysis. significant differences in hemodynamic and biochemical parameters between
groups were established using anova. student newman keuls tests were performed following a
significant f test to examine the nature of the significance. statistical significance was set at ~~0.05.

hemodynamic parameters (figure i): gvg alone did not produce any noticeable changes in heart
rate (372*13 vs 367*9 bpm), mean arterial pressure (1 l&2 vs 108*4 mmhg) or ekg during or
throughout the five minutes following its injection (data not shown). cocaine administration produced
a significant (p<o.ool) transient increase in mean arterial blood pressure from basal values of 103&4
mmhg to an average of 136*5 mmhg within 30 seconds of its injection. however, values were not
different from baseline at 2 min (p=o.o9). in the animals that were pre-treated with gvg, cocaine
resulted in a similar (105*3 to 147+4 mmhg) short-lived (~2 min), yet significant (p<o.ool) , increase
in mean arterial pressure. values were not different from basal two min after cocaine administration.
a modest decrease in heart rate was noted during cocaine injection in both the saline treated and gvg
treated animals (p=o.o72). however, values were not statistically different from basal values.
cardiac abnormalities (figure 2): the ekgs were monitored for significant changes from the
baseline rhythm during and immediately following gvg and cocaine injections. gvg injection alone
did not result in ekg changes. cocaine injection produced occasional and short-lived (+~i30set)
changes in cardiac rhythm in both gvg and saline treated animals. these consisted of widening in
qrs complex, and occasional extra-systoles. no significant prevalence was observed in the incidence
of ekg abnormalities in either group.
 xxxg941xxx  (figure 3): gvg alone produced a marked 40% decrease in circulating
levels of alt which was evident 3 h after its administration and remained decreased 24 h later
(pco.05). no further significant alterations were noted following cocaine administration in either the
gvg treated or the saline treated animals. the decrease in alt produced by gvg administration was
not accentuated or masked by cocaine administration.

discussion
the present study determined the effects of acute administration of gvg prior to a cocaine injection
in awake rats. no lethality was observed with either gvg alone or in combination with cocaine.
furthermore, it appears that acute single dose co-administration of gvg and cocaine did not result in
significant morbidity in rodents, nor did it appear to produce effects that would preclude its further
testing in a clinical setting.
previous studies have demonstrated the marked cardiodynamic alterations resulting from cocaine use
(12). the results from the present study show that gvg administration alone did not elicit any
significant alterations in mean arterial pressure or heart rate nor did it alter the transient increase in
mabp observed following cocaine administration.
in the present study we did not detect significant
ekg recording strips of events during the
changes in heart rate following cocaine administration.
cocaine injection and at subsequent time points following the injection were used to determine heart
rate in these animals. it is possible that continuous second-to-second digital recording would have
detected changes in heart rate in response to cocaine. this could explain the differences in
cardiovascular responses observed in this study from those reported by tella, et al (13). however, the
lack of effects on heart rate has been a reproducible phenomena in our laboratory. the observed
alterations in cardiac rhythm resulting from cocaine administration have been previously described by
other investigators (14). however, it is important to note that the changes observed in the present
study were transient in nature and were not affected by gvg pre-treatment.
cocaine-induced
arrhythmias are a known cause of toxicity in cocaine use. gvg pre-treatment, while not expected to
decrease the incidence of cocaine-induced arrhythmias, would be expected to decrease morbidity and
mortality due to them as a result of decreased intake of cocaine.
previous studies have reported 20- 100% decreases in plasma  xxxg941xxx  (ala-t) activity
following the use of gvg in patients with uncontrolled epilepsy (10. 15). this has been considered
of potential clinical significance as it may mask signs of early, underlying hepatic disease of other
etiology including that ofdrug abuse or resulting from infectious disease. hence, plasma alt activity
is not recommended as an index of liver cell damage in patients receiving gvg. this is of particular
importance when considering administration of the drug to a patient population with a potentially
higher than average risk of hepatotoxicity, such as would be the expected result from cocaine abuse
alone or in combination with alcohol. consistent with the reports in the literature, the results from the
present study indicate that acute administration of gvg produces detectable changes in plasma alt
activity within a relatively short period of time, and these are still evident 24 h after a single dose of
gvg. no changes were elicited by cocaine injection alone nor did we observe any alterations when
cocaine was given to the gvg pre-treated animals. whether chronic use of gvg would produce a
greater decrease in the activities of this enzyme or whether these changes would still be observed in
a chronic cocaine user remains to be elucidated. it should be noted, however, that decreases in alt
activity are not considered to be a deleterious side effect of this drug and should only be of concern
when liver specific alterations are suspected in a particular individual.
this should also be a
considered factor in the design of clinical trials of gvg treatment of cocaine abusers.
we determined arterial lactate levels as an additional index of potential metabolic disruptions resulting
both groups of animals showed a drop in
from the combination of gvg and cocaine administration.
circulating levels of lactate from basal 3 h after the administration of cocaine. these findings indicate
that this is a time-dependent phenomena and not one that is due to cocaine and/or gvg administration.
this could reflect a state of lower metabolic stress in the animals following a period of about 6 h in
the experimental setting. in addition, plasma glucose levels were also determined in these animals

1182

(data not shown) and these failed to show any changes in response to either gvg or cocaine
administration.
in summary, the results from the present study indicate that the administration of gvg prior to a
cocaine challenge does not result in overt and immediate side effects that would preclude their
combination in clinical trials. overall, the ultimate aim of reducing cocaine use and it’s associated
morbidity and mortality, is of greater benefit to the affected individual than any ofthe effects observed
in this pre-clinical study. furthermore, selection criteria for eligibility to participate in clinical trials
of treatment of cocaine abuse with gvg could be defined based on reported, yet rare, side effects of
gvg.
