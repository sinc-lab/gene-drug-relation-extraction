abstract
non-small cell lung cancer (nsclc) cells have constitutively high
expression of cytosolic  xxxg1759xxx  ( xxxg1228xxx   xxxg1763xxx ) and cyclooxygenase
(cox) 2. these nsclc cells also have increased prostaglandin expression
(pge2). many lung cancers also express 12-lipoxygenase rna and 12lipoxygenase protein and biosynthesize 12(s)-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic
acid, which correlates with their metastatic potential. several studies have
demonstrated that  xxxg1883xxx  and cox-2 inhibitors could inhibit the in vitro
growth of human lung cancer cell lines. in this report, we evaluated the
growth-inhibitory effects of  xxxd3259xxx  sulfide, a  xxxg1883xxx  and cox-2 inhibitor; exisulind ( xxxd3259xxx  sulfone), a novel proapoptotic agent that does not
inhibit cox enzymes; and  xxxd2748xxx  ( xxxd2748xxx ), a lipoxygenase inhibitor on human lung cancer cell lines. we compared these
effects with those of  xxxd2404xxx , a chemoprevention agent, and
with the cytotoxic chemotherapeutic agents paclitaxel and cisplatin, alone
or in combination. our goal was to develop new chemoprevention and
treatment strategies. each of the six agents tested inhibited the in vitro
growth of three nsclc and three sclc cell lines at the highest concentration. paclitaxel was the most potent agent (ic50 5 0.003– 0.150 mm);
 xxxd3259xxx  sulfide,  xxxd2748xxx , and  xxxd2404xxx  had intermediate potency
(ic50 5 4 – 80 mm), and cisplatin and exisulind were the least potent
(ic50 5 150 –500 mm). combination studies showed synergistic interactions for  xxxd3259xxx  sulfide, exisulind, and  xxxd2748xxx  with paclitaxel, cisplatin,
and  xxxd2404xxx , regardless of drug-resistance phenotype. at high
concentrations, the combination of  xxxd2404xxx  and each of the five
other drugs resulted in a strong synergistic effect. these studies provide a
rationale for chemoprevention (exisulind 6  xxxd3417xxx  6  xxxd2748xxx ) and
therapeutic (exisulind 6 paclitaxel 6 cisplatin) studies in patients at risk
for, or with, lung cancer.

introduction
lung cancer is the third most common cancer in the united states
(178,000 new cases in 1998) and the leading cause of cancer death
(160,400 deaths in 1998; 1). the mortality is high because there are no
known effective screening procedures, there is a high propensity for
early spread, and systemic therapies do not cure metastatic disease.
more than 85% of cases develop in current or former tobacco smokers, and more than one-half of new cases develop in former smokers,
which indicates a need for both new chemopreventive and treatment
agents (2, 3).
understanding lung cancer biology opened the opportunity for new
treatment strategies. increased levels of eicosanoids have been reported in both sclcs3 and nsclcs, which indicates that they may

play a role in tumorigenesis (4, 5). in sclc cells, neuropeptide
autocrine growth factors stimulate  xxxd208xxx  release through
activation of  xxxg1759xxx  (5). in nsclc cells, especially those
with ras mutations, there is constitutively high expression of the mr
85,000 cytosolic  xxxg1759xxx  and cox-2 (6). the arachidonic
acid metabolic pathway generates bioactive lipids that modulate physiological and pathological responses involved in tumor growth and
promotion (5). loxs generate various hydroperoxides (such as
hetes), which tend to promote invasion and metastases (5, 7).
several lox inhibitors inhibit the growth of human lung cancer cell
lines and inhibit lung tumor carcinogenesis (7, 8).  xxxg1883xxx  and cox-2
generate prostaglandins and thromboxanes.  xxxg1883xxx  is a constitutive
enzyme present in most cells, whereas cox-2 is inducible and is often
up-regulated in tumors (5, 9, 10).
classical nsaids (such as  xxxd3259xxx ) inhibit both of the cox
enzymes and were shown to inhibit tumor formation in animal models
(11–13). however, the inhibition of  xxxg1883xxx  has serious side effects
such as peptic ulcer formation and renal dysfunction. selective
cox-2 inhibitors and exisulind were developed to avoid these toxicities (14 –16). exisulind lacks the inhibitory effects on  xxxg1883xxx ,
cox-2, and lox but induces apoptosis and inhibits tumor growth in
studies involving rodent models of chemically induced mammary and
colon carcinogenesis (14 –16). exisulind was also reported to inhibit
lung tumor carcinogenesis in mice (17). a recent study reported that
exisulind inhibits cgmp phosphodiesterases, which leads to apoptosis
(18).
the combination of cox and lox inhibitors produced synergistic
growth inhibition against lewis lung carcinomas when used together
and in combination with cisplatin (4). in another study, both exisulind
and  xxxd3259xxx  sulfide produced synergistic cytotoxicity with doxorubicin and  xxxd2068xxx  against the lung cancer cell line a549, which
overexpresses mrp. these synergistic cytotoxicities did not occur
with cell lines overexpressing mdr-1p170(19). on the basis of these
results, we chose to evaluate the effects of a  xxxg1883xxx  and -2 inhibitor
( xxxd3259xxx  sulfide), a non-cox inhibitor (exisulind), a lox inhibitor
( xxxd2748xxx ),  xxxd2404xxx , cisplatin and paclitaxel on the growth
of human lung cancer cells (both sclc and nsclc) alone and in
combination. our goal was to determine whether combinations of
these agents would produce synergistic activity which would open the
potential for combination-chemoprevention and therapeutic strategies.
materials and methods
cell lines. human sclc line nci-h345 and human nsclc lines ncih157 and nci-h460 were kindly provided by drs. bruce johnson (national
cancer institute, bethesda, md) or john minna and adi gadzar (simmons
cancer center, dallas, tx). the sclc cell line shp77 was obtained from dr.
aurelia koros at the university of pittsburgh (pittsburgh, pa). the sclc line
nci-h69 and the nsclc line a549 were obtained from american type

serum or serum-free hites (hydrocortisone, insulin, transferrin,  xxxd2037xxx ,
and sodium selenium) medium. all of the cell lines were grown in 5% co2 at
37°c, 100% humidity.
immunofluorescent staining for mdr-1, mrp, and lrp. for mdr-1
cell surface staining, 5 3 105 cells were stained with the murine monoclonal
antibody 4e3 (signet laboratories inc., dedham, ma) or the isotype matched
control upc-10 (igg2a, sigma immunochemicals, st. louis, mo). the cells
were counterstained with a goat antimouse igg2a-fitc (southern biotechnology associates, inc., birmingham, al). all of the staining was done at 4°c
for 45 min followed by washing three times with hepes/ xxxd2988xxx  1 5% newton calf serum. the samples were analyzed by flow cytometry
for the percentage of positive cells (see table 1.
for mrp cytoplasmic staining, 5 3 105 cells were fixed and permeabilized
in 10% facs brand lysing solution (becton dickinson, san jose, ca) and
then stained with the murine monoclonal antibody mrpm6 (kamiya biomedical co, tukwila, wa) or with the isotype matched control mopc-21 (igg1,
sigma). the cells were counterstained with goat antimouse igg1-fitc (southern biotechnology). all of the staining was carried out as above.
lrp cytoplasmic staining was performed as above using the lrp murine
monoclonal antibody (lrp-56, iggb) which reacts with an internal epitope of
the mr 110,000 lrp, mdr-related antigen (kindly provided by dr. r. j.
scheper, free university hospital, amsterdam, the netherlands). the isotypematched control was mopc-141 (igg2b, sigma). the counterstaining antibody was goat antimouse igg2b-fitc (southern biotechnology).
agents.  xxxd2748xxx ,  xxxd2404xxx  and cisplatin were obtained from
sigma chemical co. (st. louis, mo). paclitaxel was kindly provided by terry
dugan (bristol myers-squibb co., princeton, nj).  xxxd3259xxx  sulfide and exisulind were kindly provided by cell pathways inc. (horsham, pa).
mtt growth assay. cell viability was assayed in triplicate using a mtt
assay (22). briefly, 10,000 nsclc or 20,000 sclc cells were plated in each
well of 96-well flat-bottomed microtiter plates (corning glass works, corning
ny). cell populations were harvested and plated when 75– 80% confluent.
adherent cell lines were trypsinized. the cells were allowed to recover
overnight. the following day, the various agents to be tested were added alone
or in combination at various concentrations to each triplicate well. the drug
solvent (dmso and h2o) concentrations in all of the samples were #1%.
appropriate solvent controls were run with the assays and produced no
cytotoxic effects. after a 5 day incubation, 50 ml of a 2 mg/ml solution of the
tetrazolium salt mtt (sigma chemical company), dissolved in rpmi 1640,
was added to each well. the microtiter plates were incubated for 4 h at 37°c.
at the end of the 4-h incubation, the medium was aspirated off leaving the dark
blue formazan product in the bottom of the wells. the reduced mtt product
was solubilized by adding 100 ml of 0.2 n hcl in 75% isopropanol, 25%
milliq water to each well. thorough mixing was done using a titertek
multichannel pipetter. the absorbency of each well was measured using an
automated plate reader. the data were analyzed using a slidewrite program to

determine the ic50 of each drug alone. the ci-isobologram by chou and
talalay (23) was used to analyze the drug combination assays. variable ratios
of drug concentrations were used in the studies, and mutually exclusive
equations were used to determine the cis. each ci was calculated from the
mean affected fraction at each drug ratio concentration (triplicate). ci . 1,
ci 5 1, and ci , 1 indicate antagonism, additive effect, or synergy, respectively.
cell cycle analysis. shp77 cells were added to each well of a 6-well plate
(corning glass works, corning ny) at a concentration of 1 x 105 cells/well
and incubated overnight. drugs, at various concentrations, were added to each
well the following day. cells were harvested at several time points. edta at
a concentration of 0.6 mm was used to separate the cells from the plate. cells
were spun and resuspended in krishan’s reagent (24). after an overnight
incubation, the cells were analyzed by flow cytometry at a wavelength of 488
nm on an epics xl-mcl (coulter electronics, hialeah, fl) for cell cycle
distribution. data were analyzed by modfit lt software (verity house software, topsham, maine).
apoptosis assay. a549 and shp77 cell lines at a concentration of 1 3 105
cells were added to each well of 6-well plates and incubated overnight. drugs
at various concentrations that were found to inhibit growth in an mtt assay
were added the following day. the plates were then incubated for various
times–24, 48,72, 96 and 120 h. on the scheduled day, 15 ml of a dye made of
propridium iodine (1 mg/ml) and hoechst (1 mg/ml) at a ratio of 6:1 were
added to each well and incubated for 1 h. cells were then removed from the
plates using edta (0.6 mm) and spun at 1000 rpm. the supernatant was
removed, and the precipitate containing the cells was placed on a slide. cells
were viewed on a fluorescent microscope (zeiss axioskop) under 340 with oil
immersion, and 200 cells were scored for the percent of apoptotic cells.
data analysis. statistical analysis was done using the sas proc general
linear models procedure (sas pkg 6.14 manual; sas institute, cary, nc).
the significant results in table 3 indicate contrasts comparing each drug
regimen with the control. the overall anova was significant at the 0.05 level
for each column, and the individual contrasts indicated in bold are significant
at the 0.05 level.

results
in vitro cytotoxicity. all of the six agents completely inhibited
the growth of the 6 cultured lung-cancer cell lines (table 2 and fig.
1). of the two chemotherapeutic agents tested, paclitaxel was the most
potent with an ic50 ranging from 3 to 50 nm in all of the cell lines with
the exception of the mdr-1-positive shp77 cell line, which, as
expected, required a higher concentration (0.15 mm) to inhibit 50% of
control cell growth.  xxxd2748xxx  was the next most potent drug with an
average ic50 of 28 mm in the sclc cell lines and 52 mm in the
nsclc cell lines.  xxxd3259xxx  sulfide had cytotoxicities similar to those
of  xxxd2748xxx  in five of the cell lines tested. the sclc cell line h69 was
more sensitive to  xxxd2748xxx . the sclc cell line h345 was the cell line
most sensitive to four of the drugs (excepting exisulind and cisplatin)
and was particularly sensitive to  xxxd2748xxx  (ic50 5 10 mm),  xxxd3259xxx 
sulfide (ic50 5 8 mm), and  xxxd2404xxx  (ic50 5 4 mm). like
 xxxd3259xxx  sulfide and  xxxd2748xxx ,  xxxd2404xxx  had a similar effect
on all of the cell lines with the exception of h345, which was the most
sensitive (ic50 5 4 mm). exisulind, was the least potent of the

fig. 1. in vitro mtt cytotoxicity of cisplatin, paclitaxel,  xxxd2748xxx ,  xxxd3259xxx  sulfide, exisulind, and  xxxd2404xxx  on sclc and nsclc cell lines. each concentration was run
in triplicate. the se in each triplicate was , 10%. a and b show the cytotoxicity of the chemotherapeutic drugs, cisplatin, and paclitaxel. the sensitivity of the sclc (ic 50, 300 –500
mm) and nsclc cell lines (ic50, 200 – 450 mm) to cisplatin was similar. the sensitivity of the lines to paclitaxel was also similar (sclc: ic50, 0.003– 0.05 mm and nsclc: ic50,
0.009 – 0.025 mm) except in the  xxxg10xxx  sclc line shp77 (ic50, 0.150 mm). the cytotoxicity of the nsaids— xxxd2748xxx ,  xxxd3259xxx  sulfide, and exisulind—are shown in c, d, and e,
respectively.  xxxd2748xxx  cytotoxicity was greatest in the sclc lines h345 and h69 (ic50, 10 and 15 mm, respectively). the sensitivity of the nsclc lines (ic50, 40 – 65 mm) and the sclc
line shp77 (ic50, 60 mm) to  xxxd2748xxx  was similar. the sclc lines shp77 (ic50, 60 mm) and h69 (ic50, 65 mm) and the nsclc lines (ic50, 40 – 65 mm) showed similar sensitivities
to sulfide. the sclc line h345 was very sensitive to  xxxd3259xxx  sulfide (ic50, 8 mm). exisulind cytotoxicity was similar in both sclc (ic50, 175–225 mm) and nsclc (ic50, 150 –225
mm). the cytotoxicity of the chemopreventive agent  xxxd2404xxx  is shown in f. the sensitivity of the sclc lines shp77 (ic50, 80 mm) and h69 (ic50, 65 mm) was similar
to the nsclc lines (ic50, 65– 80 mm). the sclc line h345 was the most sensitive (ic50, 4 mm).

nsaid-related compounds (ic50 5 175–225 mm). the inhibitory
effects of exisulind were similar in both nsclc and sclc cell lines.
cisplatin was found to be the least potent drug tested (ic50 5 200 –
500 mm). like exisulind, cisplatin produced similar effects on nsclc
and sclc cell lines. overall, no relationship between p53 status, the
presence of mdr-1, mrp, or lrp, and drug cytotoxicity were ob-

cell cycle analysis. as shown in fig. 2 and table 3, each of the
six drugs produced strikingly different effects in the sclc line
shp77 on cell cycle distribution and apoptosis. these differences are
consistent with different mechanisms of action. as previously reported, paclitaxel resulted in a block in g2-m with a shift in cell
population from g0-g1 to g2-m (see table 3). the peak effect was
evident after 72 h of drug exposure, but increases in g2-m were seen
as early as after 24 h, the first time point evaluated. paclitaxel’s cell
cycle effects lasted through 120 h, the last time point evaluated. the
only other drug that produced an increase in the g2-m fraction was
cisplatin which led to a maximum of 52% of cells in g2-m at 96 h (in
contrast to 23% of control cells). a striking finding was the increase
in g1 and the decrease in the s phase fraction produced by exisulind.
this effect was seen as early as 24 h, peaked at 96 h, and was still
present at 120 h. the reasons for this previously unreported accumu-

added simultaneously to the cell line. after a 5-day incubation, mtt was added, and the plates were harvested 4 h later. the effects of exisulind on the cytotoxicity of paclitaxel and cisplatin
are shown in a and c, respectively. the interaction between cisplatin and paclitaxel is shown in e. the cis for exisulind 1 paclitaxel and exisulind 1 cisplatin are shown in b and d, respectively.
the ci for paclitaxel 1 cisplatin is shown in f. a ci equal to 1 indicates an additive effect; ci , 1 indicates synergy between the two drugs; and ci . 1 indicates antagonism between the
two drugs. the cis were determined using the index-isobologram method based on the median-principle developed by chou and talalay (23). variable ratios of drug concentrations and mutually
exclusive equations were used to determine the ci. each ci was calculated from the mean affected fraction at each drug ratio concentration (triplicate).

lation in g1 and decrease in s phase are not completely clear. piazza
et al. and others have shown that the drug causes g1 arrest in colon
cancer cells (14). none of the other drugs led to either an increase in
g1 or a decrease in the s phase fraction. in fact,  xxxd2748xxx  and 13-cisretinoic acid produced an s-phase block with a higher percentage of
cells in the s phase.  xxxd3259xxx  sulfide produced little change in the cell
cycle distribution. these results imply that  xxxd3259xxx  sulfide, exisulind,
and  xxxd2748xxx  work by completely different mechanisms of action.
similar results were seen in the other five cell lines (data not shown).
apoptosis analysis. paclitaxel produced the greatest increase in
apoptotic cells in all of the three cell lines tested (a549, shp77, and
h460). the results for the  xxxg10xxx  sclc line shp77 are shown in
table 3. a greater than 10-fold increase in apoptotic cells was seen at
the highest paclitaxel concentration. this effect was evident after 48 h
of drug exposure with early evidence of apoptosis seen on fluorescent
microscopy. although cisplatin was the least potent drug for growth
inhibition, it produced the second highest precentage of apoptotic cells
(44% in shp77 cells), a 9-fold increase compared with controls. this
effect was observed as early as 72 h, peaked at 96 h and persisted
through 120 h. exisulind,  xxxd3259xxx  sulfide, and  xxxd2748xxx  produced
similar degrees of apoptosis in the shp77 line. a maximum of 25%
of cells was apoptotic at 96 h with  xxxd2748xxx , 22% with  xxxd3259xxx  sulfide,
and 19% with exisulind.  xxxd2404xxx , produced the lowest
maximal percentage (17%) of apoptotic cells.
growth inhibitory effects of drug combinations. paclitaxel
and cisplatin are frequently used in combination to treat both sclc
and nsclc patients. modest synergy (ci 6 to 21) was noted
between these agents. peak synergy (21) with these two cytotoxics
occurred in the two nsclc cell lines at moderate concentrations.
greater synergy was achieved when several of the inhibitors of
 xxxd208xxx  metabolism were combined with the cytotoxic
agents. for example, exisulind at the highest concentration produced
synergy with paclitaxel and additive or synergistic effects with cisplatin in all three of the cell lines tested. (fig. 3 and table 4).
exisulind combined with  xxxd2748xxx  or  xxxd2404xxx  also produced
21 or greater synergy in each of the three cell lines tested. the
combination of exisulind and  xxxd3259xxx  sulfide produced synergy in the

two nsclc cell lines but antagonism in the sclc cell line shp77.
the above synergies occurred most often at the highest concentration
of exisulind tested. the synergy between these agents is consistent
with the differing mechanism of actions of these agents.
the most consistent synergy was observed with  xxxd2404xxx 
combinations. combinations of  xxxd2404xxx  with  xxxd3259xxx 
sulfide, exisulind and  xxxd2748xxx  resulted in moderate to strong synergy
at high concentrations. no significant difference was noted between
nsclc and sclc cell lines. when combined with cisplatin, better
synergy was seen in the sclc cell line shp77, compared with the
nsclc cell lines. when  xxxd2404xxx  was combined with
paclitaxel, strong synergy was seen in the nsclc cell lines.
the synergy of the noncytotoxic agents suggests that combinationchemoprevention strategies are warranted, and the synergy with cytotoxic agents suggests that preclinical and clinical trials of these
combinations in advanced stages are indicated. the sclc cell line
shp77 has strong expression of mdr-1 and is more resistant to
cytotoxic agents including paclitaxel compared with other lung cancer
cell lines. in this cell line, these inhibitors of  xxxd208xxx  metabolism produced greater synergy than the combination of cytotoxic
agents.
discussion
in this report, we showed that three inhibitors of  xxxd208xxx 
metabolism inhibited the growth of both sclc and nsclc cell lines
at clinically achievable concentrations. the growth inhibition seemed
to be due to different mechanisms of action because the inhibitors
produced different effects on cell cycle and were synergistic with one
another (although there was less synergy between  xxxd3259xxx  sulfide and
 xxxd2748xxx ). these differences are consistent with the differences in the
effects of the agents on  xxxd208xxx  metabolism (4). these agents
were also synergistic with  xxxd2404xxx , which is being evaluated as a chemoprevention agent for lung cancer, and with paclitaxel
and cisplatin, which are used routinely in lung cancer therapy (25).
this suggests the possible clinical use of these agents in combinationchemoprevention strategies. such combination strategies have not,

synergistic effects of agents against human lung cancer

heretofore, been studied. the results also suggest that studies of
therapeutic combinations should be conducted.
abnormalities in  xxxd208xxx  metabolism are present in both
nsclc and sclc (4, 5). the generation of bioactive lipids, from this
metabolic pathway modulates physiological and pathological responses involved in both tumor growth and promotion. lox and
cox inhibitors have been shown to inhibit the growth of human lung
cancer cell lines in vitro and in animal models (7, 8). lox inhibitors
have been shown to prevent lung carcinogenesis in a xenograft model
as well as in a/j mice given the tobacco-specific carcinogen 4-(methlynitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone (nnk; ref. (7). similarly,
 xxxd3259xxx , a potent cox inhibitor, has also been shown to inhibit tumor
formation in animal models (11–13). the mechanism of growth
inhibition of  xxxd3259xxx  sulfide has been attributed to the inhibition of
cox. one study noted the markedly up-regulated cox-2 expression
in about one-third of atypical adenomatous hyperplasia and carcinoma
in situ specimens and a significant increase in cox-2 expression in
70% of invasive adenocarcinomas (9). in contrast, small cell carcinomas showed virtually negligible expression, and squamous cell carcinomas showed infrequent and low expression (9). in the present
study,  xxxd3259xxx  sulfide showed similar growth inhibitory effects on all
of the lung cancer cell lines except for the sclc line h345, which
was more sensitive.
in a study involving a549 nsclc cells, huang et al. (26) demonstrated increased pge2 production in response to il-1b. tumorderived pge2 promotes lymphocyte and macrophage il-10 induction
while simultaneously inhibiting macrophage il-12 production, thus,
altering the cytokine balance in the lung cancer microenvironment.
they further demonstrated that specific inhibition of cox-2 abrogated the capacity of il-1b-stimulated a549 cells to induce il-10 in
lymphocytes and macrophages as well as reversing the tumor-derived
pge2-dependent inhibition of macrophage il-12 production. an effect on cell cycle regulation may be involved in tumor growth.
aspirin, a cox inhibitor, was shown to induce cell cycle arrest with
a decrease in the proportion of cells in g0-g1 and a relative increase
in the percentage of cells in s phase and g2-m when given in high
concentrations (27). in the present study, however, no effect on the
cell cycle was seen with the addition of the cox inhibitor  xxxd3259xxx 
sulfide. higher concentrations may, thus, be needed to see this effect.
in a study involving colon cancer cells, tsujii et al. (28) demonstrated
an inhibitory effect of ns-398 (a selective cox-2 inhibitor) on
endothelial migration and tube formation, which suggested a possible
role of cox in endothelial cell migration and angiogenesis. thus, it
remains unclear whether the inhibition of cox is necessary for
growth inhibition.
the  xxxd3259xxx  metabolite, exisulind, which is devoid of inhibiting
prostaglandin synthesis activity, was the least potent of the nsaids
but produced a similar apoptotic rate to  xxxd2748xxx  and  xxxd3259xxx  sulfide.
unlike  xxxd2748xxx  or  xxxd3259xxx  sulfide, exisulind seemed to cause cell
cycle arrest in g0-g1 with a significant proportion of the cell population remaining in g1. this effect was evident by 48 h of drug
exposure and lasted up to 120 h. cell cycle regulation involves
multiple factors known as cyclins and cdks. the phosphorylation of
rb by cdks results in the release of e2f, which drives the cell into
completing the cell cycle. the activity of the cdks requires cyclin
binding, and this activity is suppressed by the inhibitors  xxxg421xxx  and
 xxxg422xxx . exisulind may affect the cell cycle by either indirectly or
directly inhibiting  xxxg366xxx  or stimulating p16 and thus regulating
the effect of rb on the cell cycle in nsclc. a similar effect was seen
in the sclc lines that lack rb. thus, the mechanism by which
exisulind blocks cell cycle in g0-g1 remains to be elucidated. other
possible targets for the effects of exisulind may be the reduction of
b-catenins, which are also known to regulate the levels of  xxxg366xxx .

piazza et al (14). also studied the mechanism of growth inhibition
of both exisulind and  xxxd3259xxx  sulfide and showed that it was produced by the induction of apoptosis, independent of p53 status in
comparison to 5-fluorouracil, an agent that requires p53 to induce
apoptosis. apoptosis by exisulind has been shown to occur via a
cox-independent pathway in multiple tumor cell lines (29). recently, thompson et al. (18) reported that exisulind induced apoptosis
in cultured tumor cells via the inhibition of  xxxd1274xxx  phosphodiesterase. phosphodiesterases are responsible for the hydrolysis of
 xxxd1773xxx  and  xxxd1274xxx , which act as intracellular second messengers in a variety of cellular functions.
the cure rate for lung cancer is a low 14%. more than 85% of cases
are found in current and former smokers. one-half of the newly
diagnosed cases develop in former smokers, which indicates a need
for chemopreventive agents.  xxxd2404xxx  is a vitamin-a derivative that has been shown as an effective chemopreventive agent.
two small studies suggested a benefit of  xxxd2404xxx  in the
prevention of secondary malignancies in high-risk individuals (30,
31). a clinical trial of  xxxd2404xxx  as a chemopreventive agent
for second malignancies in patients with completely resected nsclc
has been completed, and the final results are eagerly awaited.
a smaller trial evaluating  xxxd2404xxx  in combination with
 xxxd3521xxx  is currently in progress for patients with longstanding
tobacco abuse and evidence of sputum dysplasia. the present study
showed that the addition of  xxxd3259xxx  sulfide, exisulind, or  xxxd2748xxx  to
 xxxd2404xxx  produced synergistic growth-inhibitory effects.
these data suggest that clinical combination-chemoprevention trials
be warranted.
their side effects and the development of drug resistance limit the
use of conventional cytotoxic chemotherapeutic agents for treating
patients with lung cancers. continuous usage of cisplatin and paclitaxel often results in severe peripheral neuropathy, myelosuppression,
and resistance to multiple cytotoxic chemotherapeutic agents. in the
present study, the addition of exisulind or  xxxd3259xxx  sulfide to cisplatin
and paclitaxel resulted in synergistic growth inhibition, especially at
high concentrations, in all of the cell lines including shp77, which
overexpresses mdr-1 and is resistant to many chemotherapeutic
agents. the addition of  xxxd3259xxx  sulfide, exisulind, or  xxxd2748xxx  to
paclitaxel and cisplatin may increase effectiveness, limit toxicity, and
overcome drug resistance.  xxxd3259xxx  sulfide at high concentrations can
result in serious gastrointestinal and renal toxicity because of its effect
on prostaglandins. exisulind, being devoid of any antiprostaglandin
activity, would be a logical candidate for combination studies with
present chemotherapeutic agents. the combination of the sulfide
metabolites with either cisplatin or paclitaxel is presently being evaluated in animal models and should be evaluated also in a clinical
setting.
