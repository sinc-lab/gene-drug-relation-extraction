abstract
the purpose of the present study was to explore the analgesic effects of the low voltage-activated t-type ca2+ channel blockers  xxxd2056xxx ,
 xxxd3438xxx , and  xxxd2638xxx  in persistent and acute nociceptive tests. the anticonvulsant effects of the compounds were also determined in the
intravenous pentylenetetrazol seizure model. following intraperitoneal administration,  xxxd2056xxx  and  xxxd3438xxx  dose-dependently reversed
capsaicin-induced mechanical hyperalgesia. similarly, the highest dose of  xxxd2638xxx  tested (30 mug, intracisternal) reversed capsaicin-induced
mechanical hyperalgesia.  xxxd2056xxx  and  xxxd2638xxx  produced statistically significant analgesic effects in both early and late phase formalininduced behaviors and  xxxd3438xxx  reduced late phase behaviors. additionally,  xxxd2056xxx  and  xxxd3438xxx  produced antinociceptive effects
in the rat-tail flick reflex test. in contrast, following intracisternal administration,  xxxd2638xxx  had no effect in the tail flick reflex test. in addition,
the anticonvulsants  xxxd2056xxx  and  xxxd3438xxx  increased the doses of pentylenetetrazol required to produce both first twitch and clonic
seizures. in contrast however,  xxxd2638xxx  had no anticonvulsant effect. the present results demonstrate that the clinically used anticonvulsants
 xxxd2056xxx  and  xxxd3438xxx  provide analgesic effects at doses, which are anticonvulsant. furthermore, the data further supports the idea that
t-type ca2+ channels may be important targets for treating persistent pain syndromes.

1. introduction
a hallmark of epilepsy and neuropathic as well as
inflammatory pain is hyperexcitable neurons. from a
pharmacological perspective then, treating persistent pain
conditions with antiepileptic drugs may not be entirely
unexpected as the primary goal of antiepileptic therapy is to
decrease or limit neuronal network excitability. a number of
antiepileptic drugs are in fact efficacious in treating some pain
syndromes. for instance, the sodium channel blocker
carbamazepine is useful in treating trigeminal neuralgia (e.g.,
campbell et al., 1966) and diabetic neuropathy (e.g., gomezperez et al., 1996). in addition, the anticonvulsant gabapentin
has been reported to be effective in treating diabetic neuropathy

(backonja et al., 1998) and post herpetic neuralgia (e.g.,
rowbotham et al., 1998).
evidence has been accumulating that the anticonvulsant
 xxxd2056xxx , a low voltage-activated t-type ca2+ channel
blocker (coulter et al., 1989a,b), may also be efficacious in
the treatment of persistent pain. for instance, studies have
shown that  xxxd2056xxx  produced dose-dependent inhibition
of mechanical and thermal evoked responses (matthews and
dickenson, 2001; doğrul et al., 2003) in the spinal nerve
ligation model of kim and chung (1992). moreover, flatters
and bennett (2004) have shown that  xxxd2056xxx  reversed
paclitaxel-induced cold allodynia and vincristine-induced
mechanical hyperalgesia. additionally, shannon et al. (2005)
have recently shown that  xxxd2056xxx  produced analgesic
effects in the formalin-induced model of persistent pain.
t-type channels were originally characterized in sensory
neurons and described as small conductance channels that were
activated by weak depolarization (carbone and lux, 1984;
nowycky et al., 1985). t-type channels have been reported in

80

dorsal root ganglion and dorsal horn neurons (ryu and randic,
1990; talley et al., 1999; ikeda et al., 2003; shin et al., 2003)
and t-channel mrna transcripts have been reported in small
and medium but not large sized neurons of the dorsal root
ganglion (talley et al., 1999). correspondingly, large t-type
currents have been recorded in medium-sized dorsal root
ganglion neurons (scroggs and fox, 1992). collectively, the
data suggest that t-type currents are expressed in smaller
sensory neurons, which transmit thermal and nociceptive
information.
the primary purpose of the present study was to further
investigate the analgesic effects of several t-type calcium
channel blockers. dose–response curves were determined for
 xxxd2056xxx  (coulter et al., 1989a,b),  xxxd3438xxx  (coulter et
al., 1990; zhang et al., 1996), and  xxxd2638xxx  (clozel et al., 1997)
using the formalin, capsaicin, and tail flick tests in rats.
 xxxd2056xxx ,  xxxd3438xxx , and  xxxd2638xxx  also were tested in
the intravenous pentylenetetrazol seizure model to determine
whether doses producing antinociception were also anticonvulsant. in addition, dose–response curves were determined
for the opioid agonist morphine in each test for purposes of
comparison.

cm; length 16 cm), which were positioned in startle behavior
chambers (model sr-lab, san diego instruments, san diego,
ca). following a 30 min pretreatment and acclimation
period, rats were removed, injected s.c. with formalin (50 mul
of a 5% solution in saline) into the plantar surface of the right
hind paw, and immediately placed back into the restraint
cylinders. the magnitude of movements was recorded
continuously for 60 min in 1-s bins, as previously described
in detail (shannon and lutz, 2000). “agitation” events,
defined as the number of 1-s bins with a change in force that
exceeded a predetermined threshold (20 arbitrary units), were
totaled into 5-min bins and included licking and flinching the
affected paw, hopping, and turning.
2.4. tail flick reflex
tail flick latency was measured using the ugo basile tail
flick unit (ugo basile, comerio (va), 21025, italy), as
previously described (d’amour and smith, 1941; simmons et
al., 2002). briefly, rats (180–220 g) were gently restrained
and tested prior to drug administration to establish a baseline
latency to tail flick. drug or vehicle was then administered
and tail flick latencies were determined 30, 60, and 120 min
following treatment. the heat (50 w, i.r. = 40 u) was focused

subcutaneously (s.c.) into the plantar surface of the right hind
paw. fifteen minutes after the administration of capsaicin,
tactile allodynia was determined by an up–down method with a
calibrated series of von frey filaments, as previously described
in detail by chaplan et al. (1994). briefly, animals were placed
into clear plastic cages (17.5 × 15 × 15 cm) fitted with a wire
floor for a 5-min acclimation period. each filament was applied
to the mid-plantar region of each hind paw from below the wire
floor. von frey filaments with a bending force above 15 g lifted
the hind paws of uninjected animals without bending and were
not used; consequently the maximum withdrawal threshold was
15 g.

approximately midway the length of the tail and was set so
that baseline response latencies were 2–4 s in naïve animals,
with a 10 s time limit to prevent tissue damage. the percent
of maximal possible effect (% mpe) was calculated based on
the recorded tail flick latencies: % mpe = [(post test drug
latency − baseline latency) / (10 s − baseline latency)] * 100.
2.5. intravenous pentylenetetrazol seizure threshold
separate groups of animals weighing 55–75 g were
pretreated with vehicle or drug. following a 30 min
pretreatment period, pentylenetetrazol (1% ptz, in 0.9%
saline, 10 u.s.p. u/ml heparin sulfate, sigma, st. louis, mo)
was infused into the lateral tail vein at a constant rate (0.34
ml/min; white, 1998). time in seconds from the start of the
infusion to the appearance of the first twitch and the onset of
clonic activity were recorded for each animal. each time was
then converted to mg/kg ptz for each animal.
2.6. drugs
morphine so4,  xxxd2056xxx ,  xxxd3438xxx  and  xxxd2638xxx 
were purchased from sigma (st. louis, mo), dissolved in water
and administered subcutaneous (s.c.; morphine, 1.25–10 mg/
kg), intraperitoneally (i.p.;  xxxd2056xxx , 30–600 mg/kg and
 xxxd3438xxx , 100–600 mg/kg), or intracisternally (i.c.;
morphine, 2.5–10 mug and  xxxd2638xxx , 3–100 mug).

2.7. statistics
dose–response curves in the formalin test were constructed
by totaling the number of events during the first 5-min bin after
formalin administration (early phase) and the total number of
events from the third to ninth 5-min bins (late phase). for
capsaicin and tail flick data, median effective doses (ed50) and
corresponding 95% confidence intervals were calculated using a
litchfield–wilcoxon regression. treatment groups were
compared to appropriate vehicle control groups by analysis of
variance and dunnett’s t-test.

3.1. capsaicin test
paw withdrawal threshold to a mechanical stimulus was
reduced to approximately 1.2 g when determined 30 min
after vehicle administration and 15 min following capsaicin
administration (fig. 1, points above “v”). pretreatment with
 xxxd2056xxx  (i.p.),  xxxd3438xxx  (i.p.), or morphine (s.c.)
resulted in a dose-dependent reversal of capsaicin-induced
mechanical allodynia (fig. 1a) with a rank order of potency:
morphine (ed50 = 2.5 mg/kg) n  xxxd2056xxx  (ed50 = 108 mg/
kg) n  xxxd3438xxx  (ed50 = 567 mg/kg). in addition,  xxxd2056xxx  and morphine produced complete reversal of the
allodynia. following systemic administration (i.p.) however,

 xxxd2638xxx  had no effect on capsaicin-induced allodynia (data
not shown). however, pretreatment with  xxxd2638xxx  i.c. or
morphine i.c. resulted in dose-dependent reversal of
capsaicin-induced mechanical allodynia with ed50 values of
9.2 and 4.1 mug for  xxxd2638xxx  and morphine, respectively (fig.
1b).
3.2. formalin test
administered 30 min before formalin, morphine (2.5–10
mg/kg, s.c.) and  xxxd2056xxx  (100–450 mg/kg, i.p.)
produced dose-dependent analgesic effects in the early phase
(the initial 5 min block; fig. 2a) of the formalin response.
the effects of the 5 and 10 mg/kg doses of morphine and 300
and 450 mg/kg of  xxxd2056xxx  were statistically different
from vehicle controls. similarly, pretreatment with  xxxd2638xxx 
(i.c.) produced dose-dependent analgesic effects in the early
phase (fig. 2b) of the formalin response with doses of 10 and 30
mug providing modest but statistically significant decreases when
compared to vehicle controls. in contrast, however, pretreatment
with  xxxd3438xxx  up to 600 mg/kg did not alter the early phase
response (fig. 2a). in addition, morphine,  xxxd2056xxx , and
 xxxd2638xxx  also produced dose-dependent analgesic effects in the
late phase (5 min blocks 3–9; fig. 2c and d) of the formalin
response. moreover,  xxxd3438xxx  (i.p.) produced analgesia in
the late phase at the highest dose tested (600 mg/kg; fig. 2c).
3.3. tail flick reflex
tail flick latencies were time- and dose-dependently
increased following pretreatment with morphine (ed50 = 1.2
mg/kg; fig. 3a),  xxxd2056xxx  (ed50 = 132 mg/kg; fig. 3b),
and  xxxd3438xxx  (ed50 = 232 mg/kg; fig. 3c). additionally,
 xxxd2056xxx  and morphine produced the maximum possible
effect at the highest doses tested (450 mg/kg, i.p. and 10 mg/kg,
s.c., respectively). in contrast,  xxxd2638xxx  (3–30 mug/rat) was
without significant effect on tail flick latencies after i.c.
administration (fig. 3d).
3.4. i.v. ptz seizure threshold
pretreatment with  xxxd2056xxx  (100–600 mg/kg, i.p.)
produced approximately a 7-fold increase in the threshold
dose of ptz required to produce the first twitch (fig. 4a).
 xxxd3438xxx  (100–600 mg/kg, i.p.) increased first twitch
threshold approximately 3-fold (fig. 4a).  xxxd2638xxx  (30–100
mug, i.c.) pretreatment however had no significant effect on
ptz-induced twitch threshold (fig. 4b). in contrast, the dose
of ptz required to produce the first twitch was reduced
following the administration of morphine (5–10 mg/kg, s.c.;
fig. 4a).
as observed with first twitch thresholds, pretreatment with
 xxxd2056xxx  (100–600 mg/kg, i.p.) and  xxxd3438xxx  (100–
600 mg/kg, i.p.) produced approximately 8- and 4-fold
increases in the dose of ptz required to produce clonus when
compared to vehicle controls (fig. 4c), respectively.  xxxd2638xxx 
(30–100 mug, i.c.) had no significant effect on ptz-induced

83

clonic seizure thresholds (fig. 4d). morphine (5–10 mg/kg, s.
c.) however produced a significant decrease in the clonic seizure
threshold for ptz (fig. 4c).
4. discussion
the goal of the present study was to investigate the
antihyperalgesic properties of several low voltage-activated ttype ca2+ channel blockers. the results demonstrate that the
antiepileptic drugs and t-type ca2+ channel blockers  xxxd2056xxx  and  xxxd3438xxx  are effective in attenuating the
response to formalin and capsaicin, and produce antinociception
at doses that are anticonvulsant.  xxxd2638xxx  (i.c.) was similarly
effective in decreasing the response to formalin and capsaicin
but unlike  xxxd2056xxx  and  xxxd3438xxx  did not produce
antinociception nor was  xxxd2638xxx  anticonvulsant.
 xxxd2056xxx ,  xxxd3438xxx  and  xxxd2638xxx  all produced
dose-related reversals of capsaicin-induced mechanical allodynia. the subcutaneous injection of capsaicin selectively
activates primary afferent c-fibers (baumann et al., 1991) and
sensitizes spinothalamic tract neurons (simone et al., 1991;
dougherty and willis, 1992), resulting in thermal hyperalgesia
and mechanical allodynia (gilchrist et al., 1996). t-type ca2+
channels were originally characterized in sensory neurons
(carbone and lux, 1984; nowycky et al., 1985) and dorsal root
ganglion as well as in dorsal horn neurons in the spinal cord (ryu
and randic, 1990; talley et al., 1999; ikeda et al., 2003; shin et
al., 2003). activation of t-type ca2+ channels is thought to
lower the threshold for action potentials and promote bursting
activity (e.g., huguenard, 1996; matthews and dickenson,
2001), factors which could contribute to central sensitization and
mechanical allodynia. the present findings that  xxxd2056xxx ,
 xxxd3438xxx  and  xxxd2638xxx  are efficacious in reversing
capsaicin-induced mechanical allodynia thus provide further
support for the hypothesis that low voltage-activated t-type
ca2+ channels are important in modulating sensory transmission, including pain-related information.
the s.c. injection of formalin produces biphasic behavioral
and electrophysiological effects (dubuisson and dennis, 1977;
puig and sorkin, 1996; dickenson and sullivan, 1987a,b) with
the early phase thought to represent an acute nociceptive injury
and the late phase a model of central sensitization (e.g.,
dubuisson and dennis, 1977). while  xxxd2056xxx ,  xxxd3438xxx , and  xxxd2638xxx  all reduced the formalin-induced late
phase behaviors, only  xxxd2056xxx  and  xxxd2638xxx  produced
dose-related reductions in the formalin-induced early phase
behaviors.  xxxd2056xxx  (matthews and dickenson, 2001;
doğrul et al., 2003) and  xxxd2638xxx  (doğrul et al., 2003) have
been shown to reverse both tactile allodynia and thermal
hyperalgesia in animals with ligation of the l5/l6 branches of the
sciatic nerve. additionally, flatters and bennett (2004)
demonstrated that  xxxd2056xxx  produced analgesia in
paclitaxil- and vincristine-induced peripheral neuropathy. the
present investigation complements the findings of these
previous reports, which demonstrated that  xxxd2056xxx  and
 xxxd2638xxx  were efficacious in neuropathic pain models and
extends these findings to include the t-type channel blocker

84

 xxxd3438xxx . taken together, the data indicate that blockade of
t-type ca2+ channels may provide a novel treatment of
persistent pain conditions.
 xxxd2056xxx  and  xxxd2638xxx  were analgesic not only in the
early phase of the formalin test, but also, along with
trimehadione, produced antinociception in the tail flick test,
suggesting that t-type channel blockers may be efficacious in
treating acute pain as well as persistent pain. the present
findings support those of todorovic et al. (2001) which reported
that  xxxd2638xxx  produced antinociception in thermal and
mechanical nociceptive tests following systemic administration.
in contrast, doğrul et al. (2001) reported that  xxxd2638xxx ,
administered systemically, had no effect in the tail flick test.
furthermore, neither  xxxd2056xxx  nor  xxxd2638xxx  produced
thermal antinociception in either the uninjured limb of sciatic
nerve ligated rats or in sham operated rats (doğrul et al., 2003).
the reasons for these differences in the acute antinociceptive
efficacy of t-type channel blockers are not entirely apparent,
but may be related to the differences in the pain models, doses,
or routes of administration used in each study. alternatively, ttype channels may only be activated in states of
hyperexcitability, such as after the administration of capsaicin
or formalin, or when an acute noxious stimulus is more intense.
further studies are needed to more clearly define the potential
acute antinociceptive properties of t-type ca2+ channel
blockers following systemic and central administration.
both central and peripheral t-type channels may be important
in modulating pain-related sensory information. in the present
studies, i.c. but not systemically administered  xxxd2638xxx 
reversed capsaicin-induced mechanical allodynia as well as
decreased both early and late phase formalin behaviors,
suggesting that supraspinal t-type channels may be important in
modulating pain-related information. however, in the sciatic
nerve ligation model (doğrul et al., 2003), both  xxxd2638xxx  and
 xxxd2056xxx  blocked tactile and thermal hypersensitivities after
i.p. administration. following local intraplantar administration
however, only  xxxd2638xxx , and not  xxxd2056xxx , produced
antinociception (doğrul et al., 2003). because  xxxd2638xxx  does
not cross the blood–brain barrier, the efficacy of  xxxd2638xxx  after
i.p. and intraplantar administration suggests that peripheral ttype channels are important in modulating pain-related
information, at least in neuropathic pain. moreover, neither
 xxxd2638xxx  nor  xxxd2056xxx  were efficacious in the sciatic nerve
ligation model after intrathecal administration at the doses tested
(doğrul et al., 2003), thereby suggesting that spinal t-type
channels may be less important. however, matthews and
dickenson (2001) demonstrated the importance of t-type
channels in the spinal cord in the sciatic nerve ligation model.
while further experiments are needed, the findings to date
suggest that t-type channels in the periphery, spinal cord and
brain may play different roles in different pain states.
of particular clinical relevance from the present investigation
is the demonstration that  xxxd2056xxx  and  xxxd3438xxx 
provided analgesia at doses that were also anticonvulsant. thus,
our results suggest the possibility that  xxxd2056xxx  and
 xxxd3438xxx  may be useful in the treatment of pain at clinically
relevant (i.e., anticonvulsant) doses. although  xxxd2638xxx 

produced analgesia, it was not anticonvulsant after i.c.
administration. the reason(s) for the lack of anticonvulsant
activity of  xxxd2638xxx  are unclear; however,  xxxd2638xxx  (i.c.) may
not have reached sufficient concentrations in higher brain
centers such as the thalamus to produce anticonvulsant effects.
alternatively, three subtypes of t-type channels have been
cloned (e.g., see gomora et al., 2001) and it is possible that the
different subtypes of t-type channels may be differentially
involved in producing anticonvulsant, acute antinociceptive,
antihyperalgesic and/or antiallodynic effects.
t-type calcium channels enhance neuronal excitability by
allowing ca2+ entry near resting membrane potentials (magee
and johnston, 1995). this ca2+ entry strengthens synaptic
inputs and decreases the activation threshold required for action
potential generation (huguenard, 1996). thus, blockade of ttype channels may be expected to lead to a decrease in overall
neuronal excitability. it has been suggested that block of t-type
channels with  xxxd2056xxx  may decrease excitability through a
number of mechanisms. matthews and dickenson (2001) have
suggested that block of t-type channels may lead to decreased
neurotransmitter release thereby preventing depolarization.
interestingly, nmda-mediated post-discharge spikes, which
are a hallmark of central sensitization and hyperexcitability,
were especially sensitive to the effects of  xxxd2056xxx 
(matthews and dickenson, 2001). however,  xxxd2056xxx  had
a similar effect both before and after neuropathic injury
(matthews and dickenson, 2001). in contrast, the t-type
channel antagonist alpha-methyl-alpha-phenylsuccimide was more
effective in reducing t-currents in normal rats than axotomised
rats (chung et al., 1993). taken together, the data suggest that ttype channel modulation of neuronal excitability may be more
prominent in hyperexcitable and/or neuropathic states.
in summary, the analgesic activity of  xxxd2056xxx ,
 xxxd3438xxx , and  xxxd2638xxx  further supports the proposed
role of t-type channels in nociception and processing of painrelated information. moreover, the observation that dose
ranges providing analgesia and anticonvulsant activity overlap
suggests that the t-type channel blockers such as  xxxd2056xxx  and  xxxd3438xxx  may be a potentially novel
therapy for some pain syndromes.
