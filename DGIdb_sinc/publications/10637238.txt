comparison of chemotherapy with chemohormonal
therapy as first-line therapy for metastatic, hormonesensitive breast cancer: an eastern cooperative oncology
group study
by g.w. sledge, jr, p. hu, g. falkson, d. tormey, and m. abeloff for the eastern cooperative oncology group
purpose: although hormonal therapy represents
standard therapy for metastatic hormone-sensitive
disease, many patients receive initial chemotherapy
because of the location, bulk, or aggressiveness of
their disease. it is uncertain whether simultaneous
hormonal therapy provides additional benefit compared with chemotherapy alone. eastern cooperative
oncology group trial e3186 was initiated to explore this
question.
patients and methods: between january 1988 and
december 1992, 231 patients with  xxxg730xxx 
(er)–positive or er-unknown metastatic breast cancer
were randomized to receive either chemotherapy
(cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and fluorouracil
[caf]) or chemohormonal therapy (caf plus tamoxifen
and  xxxd2136xxx  [ xxxd2136xxx ; pharmacia-upjohn,
kalamazoo, mi] [cafth]) as front-line therapy for metastatic breast cancer. patients who experienced a complete response to induction therapy either received or
did not receive maintenance cyclophosphamide, meth-

otrexate, fluorouracil, prednisone, and th as a secondary randomization.
results: the response rates (complete response and
partial response) of patients who received caf and cafth
were similar (69.2% v 68.9%, respectively; p ⴝ .99). time
to treatment failure (ttf) was slightly longer for patients
who received chemohormonal therapy compared with
chemotherapy alone patients (13.4 months v 10.3
months, respectively; p ⴝ .087), and ttf was significantly
longer in er-positive compared with er-negative patients
(17.4 months v 10.3 months, respectively; p ⴝ .048).
however, er status had no effect on overall survival (30.0
months for caf v 29.3 months for cafth).
conclusion: in patients with potentially hormonesensitive metastatic breast cancer, chemohormonal
therapy prolongs ttf for er-positive patients without
improving overall survival.

etastatic breast cancer claims the lives of
more than 45,000 women every year in the united
states.1 although the majority of these women have  xxxg730xxx  (er)–positive (and hence, potentially hormone-sensitive) tumors, many are not considered candidates for initial hormonal monotherapy because of the
location, bulk, or aggressive pace of their disease. many
such women receive either chemotherapy alone or chemohormonal therapy as the initial management of their metastatic breast cancer. it is uncertain whether the use of
chemotherapy or chemohormonal therapy represents a superior therapeutic choice for these patients.
similarly, the optimal duration of chemotherapy in such
patients remains a contentious issue. prolonged chemotherapy might have the potential benefits of improving duration

of response or survival but possibly at the price of increased
treatment-related toxicity.
in the eastern cooperative oncology group (ecog) trial
e3186 these questions are examined in a prospective,
randomized fashion. this article presents data regarding the
comparison of chemotherapy with chemohormonal therapy
as initial therapy in patients with potentially hormonesensitive metastatic breast cancer. the effect of duration of
chemotherapy in metastatic disease was presented in a
recent publication and demonstrated no survival benefit for
maintenance chemotherapy in patients undergoing a complete remission with induction therapy.2

patients and methods
women were considered eligible for entry if they had histologically
documented breast cancer that was recurrent or metastatic, er-positive
or er-unknown, or er-negative but responsive to prior therapeutic
hormonotherapy other than antiestrogen or androgen therapy. er status
was determined by the dextran-coated charcoal method. patients were
required to have measurable or assessable disease, and they could be
pre- or postmenopausal, with an ecog performance status of 0 to 3.
patients could not have received prior chemotherapy for metastatic
disease but could have received prior adjuvant therapy (hormone and/or
chemotherapy) if they had a recurrence longer than 6 months since last
receiving therapy. patients, who had received prior additive hormonotherapy for metastatic disease with drugs other than androgens or
tamoxifen, were considered eligible provided that at least 1 week had

elapsed since stopping therapy without evidence of a withdrawal
response. patients who received a prior oophorectomy for metastatic
disease or recurrence were considered eligible provided that 4 weeks
had elapsed since surgery and that relapse or lack of benefit was
documented. prior radiotherapy was allowed provided that it did not
include more than 30 gy to ⱖ 50% of the pelvic bone structure, that the
radiation was not concurrent with chemotherapy, and that the site(s) of
measurable or assessable disease was outside the radiotherapy port.
patients were required to have adequate hematologic, renal, and hepatic
function, and to have a fasting blood sugar less than 170 m/dl. all
patients were required to have signed an institutional review board–
approved informed consent.
patients were considered ineligible for failing to meet any of the
above criteria. in addition, patients were ineligible if they had a history
of a prior malignancy other than breast cancer, squamous cell cancer of
the skin, or in situ cervical carcinoma. patients who were considered
poor medical or psychiatric risks, patients within 2 weeks of major
surgery, patients on adrenal replacement steroids, patients who received prior chemotherapy for known metastatic disease, and pregnant
or lactating patients were all considered ineligible.
after registration, patients were stratified on the basis of prior
hormone response or er status (ie, er-negative and responded to prior
hormonotherapy, er-positive, or er-unknown), prior adjuvant therapy, number of involved organ sites, performance status, and menopausal status. patients were randomized to receive induction chemotherapy with either chemotherapy (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin,
and fluorouracil [caf]) or chemohormonal therapy (caf plus tamoxifen and  xxxd2136xxx  [ xxxd2136xxx ; pharmacia-upjohn, kalamazoo,
mi] [cafth]). the chemotherapy regimen consisted of cyclophosphamide (100 mg/m2 orally [po] day 1 through 14 as a single daily dose),
doxorubicin (30 mg/m2 intravenous [iv] day 1 and 8, to a maximum

cumulative dose of 360 mg/m2), and fluorouracil (500 mg/m2 iv day 1
and 8). hormonotherapy consisted of tamoxifen 20 mg po daily and
 xxxd2136xxx  20 mg po daily. cycles of therapy were repeated on day 29
and were continued until progressive disease, relapse, or the completion of six cycles, whichever occurred first.
patients who achieved a complete remission after induction therapy
were then randomized to either receive maintenance chemotherapy
with cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, fluorouracil, prednisone, and
th (cmf[p]th) or to observation. patients with either stable disease
or a partial response (pr) were registered to continue treatment with
the regimen they received during induction, with methotrexate substituted for doxorubicin. the cmf(p)th regimen consisted of cyclophosphamide (100 mg/m2 po day 1 through 14 as a single daily dose),
methotrexate (40 mg/m2 iv day 1 and 8), fluorouracil (600 mg/m2 iv
day 1 and 8), prednisone (40 mg/m2 days 1 through 14, in the first three
cycles only, as a single daily dose), tamoxifen (20 mg po daily as a
single daily dose), and ( xxxd2136xxx  20 mg po daily as a single daily
dose). cycles were repeated on day 29 and were continued until
relapse. dose modifications for both induction and maintenance therapy were performed for hematologic toxicity, renal and hepatic
dysfunction, and gastrointestinal toxicity.
responses were judged by standard ecog criteria. a complete
response (cr) implied the total disappearance of all reversible clinical
evidence of disease for at least two measurement periods separated by
at least 4 weeks. for bone lesions, a cr required recalcification of lytic
lesions and return of blastic lesions to normal density. a pr required
a reduction in the size of all measurable tumor areas by at least a 50%,
as measured by the product of the greatest length and the maximum
width, or at least a 30% reduction in unidimensionally measured
lesions. where measurable lesions were nonexistent, a pr required a
decrease of 50% or more of the involved organ sites. no lesion could
progress, and no new lesion could appear. bone lesions that demonstrated healing on x-ray were considered a true pr. improvement for
osseous disease required a decrease of 1 point in analgesia requirements or a decrease to no analgesia requirements, or an ecog
performance point improvement or a return to 100% performance.
progressive disease implied any of the following: (1) the appearance of
a new lesion, (2) an increase of 25% in the sum of areas of lesions
within any one organ site, or (3) (in bony sites) if subjective progressive
disease existed, as noted by increasing bone pain or decreasing
performance status.
the two end points of interest for this study were time to treatment
failure (ttf) and survival time. ttf was measured in months from the
date of randomization onto induction to the date of progression,
relapse, or the date of death from any cause without documented
progression or relapse. those still alive and without progression were
censored at the date last known to be in response. survival was
measured from the time of randomization onto induction to the time of
death from any cause, and those still alive were censored at the date last
known to be alive.
fisher’s exact test3 was used to compare patient toxicity and
response rate. the survival distributions for ttf and overall survival
were estimated using the kaplan-meier method.4 comparisons of ttf
and overall survival were based on the unstratified log-rank tests.5 all
p values are from two-sided tests, and the term significant refers to
two-sided p values less than or equal to .05.
the study design was that of a phase iii randomized trial. from a
statistical standpoint, with 200 eligible patients (100 per regimen),
there would be approximately an 81% chance of declaring a significant
difference in ttf between the two study arms, assuming that one arm
had a 50% higher median and that a one-sided test of 0.05 size was

results

between january 1988 and december 1992, 231 patients
entered onto this eastern cooperative oncology group
phase iii trial comparing chemotherapy (caf) with chemohormonal therapy (cafth) as initial therapy for metastatic
breast cancer. eighteen patients (7.8%) are not included in
response analysis because of ineligibility or because they
never started on treatment, leaving 213 patients for analysis.
three patients were excluded because they never started on
treatment; two of these refused treatment, and, in one
patient, one lack of recurrent disease was discovered before
therapy initiation. an additional 15 patients were ineligible;
eight had no assessable disease, three had had prior chemo-

temic therapy, remains poor. traditionally, systemic therapy has involved the use of either chemotherapy or hormonotherapy, with the choice between these two modalities
being based on such factors as steroid receptor status,
performance status, disease bulk, number of disease sites,
and age. for some steroid receptor–positive patients, initial
chemotherapy has been chosen because of the aggressive
nature of the disease. in these patients, combining hormonotherapy with chemotherapy has the potential benefit of
increasing therapeutic response, ttf, and overall survival
through additive or synergistic cytotoxicity.

this trial compared the use of induction chemotherapy
with chemohormonal therapy in patients with potentially
hormone-sensitive metastatic breast cancer (ie, er-positive
or er-unknown metastatic breast cancer). the trial was
conducted during an era in which the growing use of
adjuvant hormonal therapy gradually reduced the pool of
er-positive patients who had not received adjuvant hormonal therapy before the onset of metastatic disease.
the results of this trial suggest that the addition of
hormonotherapy to chemotherapy prolongs time to progression in er-positive patients. this improvement was seen
despite the fact that the addition of th to caf chemotherapy had no effect on overall response rate, suggesting that
the effect of hormonotherapy was in the maintenance rather

sledge et al

than the induction of remission. despite this increase in
ttf, no change was seen in overall survival time. patients
who received chemotherapy presumably received hormonotherapy at time of progression, which suggests that the use
of combined chemohormonal therapy offers no survival
benefit over the use of sequential therapy. because this trial
included no quality-of-life measures, it is difficult to say
whether the increased ttf of the combined therapy had a
significant clinical impact. increased ttf might have the
potential benefits of improved quality of life, decreased
cancer-related symptomatology, balanced by the potential
for increased treatment-related toxicity.
the improved ttf seen in er-positive patients was not
seen in patients whose er status was unknown. this may
suggest that only a relatively small percentage of such
patients entered onto the trial had hormone-sensitive tumors
and were, therefore, unlikely to benefit from hormonal
therapy.
the results of this trial should be seen in the context of
other trials in which chemotherapy has been compared with
chemohormonal therapy. as may be seen in table 4, these
trials have varied considerably with regard to response rate

and ttf. in general, however, such trials have shown no
clear survival benefit for the addition of hormonal therapy to
chemotherapy. the current trial reinforces this conclusion.
the current trial differs significantly from other trials
with regard to eligibility criteria and patient population. all
of the trials listed in table 4 had either a majority of patients
with er-negative or er-unknown tumors6-12 or allowed
prior hormonal therapy for metastatic disease.13,14 hormonal therapy is unlikely to benefit er-negative patients
and less likely to benefit patients who have received prior
hormonal therapy. therefore, an appropriate test of the
benefits of chemohormonal therapy would seem to require a
group in which the majority of patients were definably
er-positive and had not received prior hormonal therapy.
to the best of our knowledge, this is the only such trial that
meets these criteria, although cancer and leukemia group
b trial 80818,15 had a significant subset of definably erpositive patients.
with regard to future trials, the availability of novel agents
allows for the retesting old concepts. the issues addressed in
this article might be reexamined with the availability of
aromatase inhibitors or with pure antiestrogens.
