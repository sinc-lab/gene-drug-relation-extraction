objective. we recently demonstrated that patients with high levels of circulating dendritic
cells (dc) and interleukin (il)-12 are associated with reduced cancer relapse after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. identifying a growth factor that can promote these immune
functions may have beneficial anti-tumor effects. we investigated the hypothesis that
granulocyte-macrophage  xxxg526xxx  (gm-csf) induces il-12 production
and polarizes t lymphocytes toward a proinflammatory response.
materials and methods. peripheral blood mononuclear cells (pbmc), t lymphocytes, and
antigen-presenting cells (apc) were cultured with gm-csf and compared with no growth
factors (control), g-csf, or both gm-csf and g-csf. cells were matured with either
lipopolysaccharide or lectin (phytohemagglutinin). type 1 and type 2 cytokines were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. induction of allogeneic t-lymphocyte proliferation induced by gm-csf–stimulated apc was measured by mixed lymphocyte reaction. dc
were measured by flow cytometry.
results. levels of type 1 (il-12, interferon-g,  xxxg2296xxx -a) cytokines increased
while type 2 (il-10 and il-4) cytokines decreased after stimulation of pbmc, t lymphocytes,
and apc with gm-csf. apc treated with gm-csf induced higher proliferation of allogeneic t cells.  xxxg1208xxx  and  xxxg1178xxx -positive dc proliferated after exposure to gm-csf. both
subtypes of dc (dc1 and dc2) were increased by gm-csf.
conclusions. gm-csf induces production of type 1 proinflammatory cytokines by human
pbmc, t lymphocytes, and apc. type 2 cytokines are downregulated by gm-csf and
proliferation of allogeneic t cells is increased. these results demonstrate the potential for
gm-csf as a clinical agent for immune stimulation. ó 2007 iseh - society for hematology

a critical aspect of the immune defense is mediated by
helper function of newly activated t helper (th) cells and
by professional antigen-presenting cells (apc). dendritic
cells (dc) are the most potent apc known, triggering t
cells into cell-cycle progression [1,2]. it is now clear that
dc can also influence, and likely dictate, subsequent development of these proliferating t cells. activation and proliferation of immune cells might lead to different patterns of
cytokine secretion and the responses elicited can be polarized into type 1 or type 2 functions [3,4]. dc are rich in
class ii human leukocyte antigens (hla) and can be subdivided into two subtypes. type 1 dc (dc1) express  xxxg1208xxx

and polarize naive t cells toward a t-helper 1 (th1) phenotype [5]. type 2 (dc2) does not express  xxxg1208xxx , but does
express  xxxg1178xxx  and polarizes t cells toward a th2 phenotype [5]. th1 induces inflammatory cytokine production,
such as interleukin (il)-12, interferon-g (ifn-g), and
 xxxg2296xxx -a ( xxxg2296xxx ). in contrast, th2 downregulates innate and acquired anti-tumor immunity and
secretes cytokines such as il-4 and il-10.
we have recently reported that increased circulating dc
levels are correlated with improved survival and reduced
cancer relapse after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation
(hsct) [6]. furthermore, we have demonstrated that the
proinflammatory cytokine il-12 has been associated with
improved relapse-free survival without increasing graftvs-host disease [7]. this graft-vs-leukemia effect is usually
mediated by alloreactive donor t cells, and/or natural killer
cells, and it has been theorized that a th1 profile is

protective against leukemia relapse and is, therefore, beneficial; while a th2 profile may be deleterious because it can
promote relapse as well as tumor growth and dissemination
[8].
granulocyte-macrophage  xxxg526xxx 
(gm-csf) is an agent that is considered to promote
immune stimulatory dc after autologous hsct [9]. it
has also been used, in combination with other cytokines,
for differentiation of progenitor cells into dc and it is being
studied as an adjuvant to cancer vaccines [9–11]. in this
setting, gm-csf has been shown to increase protective
immunity to melanomas when cancer cells are transduced
with its gene [12–14]. gm-csf is also an approved growth
factor that promotes granulocyte recovery [9,15]. despite
this promising clinical potential, its immune effects as a single agent in hsct and cancer vaccine trials are not welldefined. in vitro studies often combine gm-csf with other
cytokines, while generating dc in cultures [16]. in combination with either il-4 or  xxxg2296xxx  gm-csf is known to
elicit dc, which have higher levels of costimulatory
molecules, an indication of greater functional maturation
[16–19]. in these systems, gm-csf stimulates an intense
local immune response consisting of recruitment of dc,
macrophages, and granulocytes, as well as a marked expansion of dc locally and systemically that stimulates high
levels of protective immunity. this enhanced activity results in more efficient t-cell stimulation and a more immunogenic response. however, these properties have not been
investigated with gm-csf alone and are the objectives of
this study. given our recent data demonstrating the importance of both dc and il-12 in anti-tumor effects after
allogeneic hsct, gm-csf may be considered as a therapeutic agent to promote these effects should it demonstrate
these effects in vitro.
we hypothesize that gm-csf induces allogeneic t-cell
proliferative responses promotes proinflammatory type 1
immune cytokine responses. if such immune effects can
induce beneficial anti-tumor effects in vivo by administration of gm-csf after allogeneic hsct to reduce cancer
relapse. therefore, we investigated the immune effects of
gm-csf on human peripheral blood mononuclear cells
(pbmc), t cells, and dc in an allogeneic setting.

materials and methods
cell culture
all cultures of human pbmc and derived cells were maintained in
rpmi-1640 medium (sigma, st louis, mo, usa) supplemented
with 2 mm l-glutamine (life technologies, paisley, scotland),
5000 u/ml penicillin (sigma), 5000 u/ml streptomycin sulfate
(sigma), and 10% v/v fetal bovine serum (gibco, carlsbad, ca,
usa).
pbmc were isolated from buffy coats (leukopac, pbl)
obtained from lifesouth community blood center (gainesville,
fl, usa) by  xxxd3253xxx -hypaque density gradient centrifugation using

lymphoprep (axis-shield, norway). briefly, the contents of the buffy
coat were diluted three times its volume in sterile 1 phosphatebuffered saline (pbs) (ph 7.4; gibco). the dilution was
layered onto the lymphoprep in a 2:1 ratio. the sample was
then centrifuged for 25 minutes at 22 c and 1200 rpm.
pbmc were collected at the interface, washed twice with
pbs, and centrifuged each time for 10 minutes at 4 c and
1200 rpm. cell viability was assessed by trypan blue exclusion.
cells were cultured at a concentration of 1  106 cells/ml.
pbmc were cultured in media, as described here, with no
growth factor (control), recombinant human g-csf (1  108
u/ml; neupogen, amgen, thousand oaks, ca, usa), recombinant human gm-csf (2.8  106 u/ml; leukine, provided by berlex corporation, seattle, wa, usa), or g-csf/
gm-csf together for either 24 hours or 48 hours. cultures
were matured with either lipolysaccharide (lps; 1 ug/ml;
sigma) for nonspecific stimulation of granulocytes or lectin
(phytohemagglutin [pha]; 5 ug/ml; sigma) for nonspecific
stimulation of lymphocytes for another 24 hours or 48 hours
(fig. 1). after culture, cells were frozen in media supplemented
with 10% v/v dimethylsulfoxide. supernatants were snap-frozen.
isolation of monocytes and t cells from pbmc
t cells were purified from pbmc by negative-selection using the
pan t cell isolation kit (miltenyi biotec, bergisch gladbach, germany). t-cell–depleted pbmc are labeled as apc fraction. monocytes were purified using the magnetic-activated cell sorting
cd14-positive selection kit (miltenyi biotec) and were subsequently cultured for 6 days at a concentration of 1  106cells/
ml in fresh media as described previously.
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (elisa)
after culture, aliquots of supernatants were frozen and stored at
20 c. briefly, 96-well plates (nunc-immuno plate, roskilde,
denmark) were coated with 1 mg/ml purified monoclonal
antibody against human il-12 (p70), il-10,  xxxg2296xxx , ifn–g, or
il-4 (pierce-endogen, rockford, il, usa) in coating buffer
(1 pbs, ph 7.4) at room temperature overnight. plates were
then incubated in blocking buffer (1 pbs, ph 7.4 with 1% bovine  xxxg124xxx ; sigma, axel, the netherlands) for 2 hours
at room temperature and washed in 0.05% tween-20. standard
serial dilutions were added to the plates as well as 50 ul supernatant in triplicate followed 1 hour later by biotin-labeled anticytokine antibody. recombinant human  xxxg2296xxx , human ifn-g,
human il (hil)-4, hil-10, and hil-12 p70 were used as standards
in the assays, as provided by the manufacturer. cytokines were
captured by the specific primary monoclonal antibody and detected by biotin-labeled anti–ifn-g, anti– xxxg2296xxx , anti–il-4,
anti–il-10, or anti–il-12 (pierce-endogen). the color reaction
by streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase was incubated for 20 minutes and developed by adding tmb microwell peroxidase substrate (pierce-endogen) and stopped by the addition of an equal
volume of 0.18 m h2so4. absorbance was read at 450 nm.
mixed leukocyte reaction
proliferative t-cell responses to irradiated treated monocytes were
measured by brdu elisa as described by the manufacturer
(roche diagnostics, manheim germany). different monocyte
preparations were harvested and irradiated in a gamma irradiator
to 35 gy. monocytes were then cocultured in triplicate with

allogeneic cd4þ t cells in 96-well, round-bottom plates at a ratio
of 1:5 for 24 hours. brdu was then added to the wells for incorporation into proliferating cells for another 24 hours. cells were
then centrifuged for 10 minutes at 1200 rpm in 4 c and dried
for 15 minutes or until completely dry. elisa was performed
(as described) and the colorimetric change measured at 450 nm.

flow cytometry
presence of dc was assayed by four-color immunofluorescence
staining with a panel of directly conjugated antibodies. the 1 
106 cultured monocytes were stained with lineage (lin) fluorescein isothiocyanate–conjugated antibody cocktail (cd2, cd3,
cd4, cd14, cd16,  xxxg375xxx , cd20, cd56);  xxxg1208xxx  allophycocyaninconjugated antibody;  xxxg1178xxx  (il-3r) fluorescein isothiocyanate–
conjugated antibody and hla-dr percp–conjugated antibody
(bd biosciences, heidelberg, germany). type 1 dc were defined
as cd11cþ hla-drþ lin cells and type 2 dc were defined as
cd123þ hla-drþ lin. to stain, pelleted cells were incubated
for 30 minutes at 4 c with antibodies, washed with staining buffer
(pbs þ 2% bovine  xxxg124xxx  þ 0.1% na azide), and then fixed
with 2% paraformaldehyde and stored at 4 c. cells were analyzed
on a facscalibur flow cytometer (bd biosciences). quantitation
was done by cellquest (bd biosciences; software version 3.2.1).
isotype-specific immunoglobulin controls were run for each fluorochrome. twenty-five thousand cells were analyzed for each sample.

statistical analysis
data were analyzed by the method of analysis of variance
(anova) with the production of each cytokine (il-12, ifn-g,
ifn-a, il-10, or il-4) as the dependent variable and the following
variables as independent variables: cell type (pbmc, t cell, and
apc), stimulation (lps and pha), and growth factor (control,
g-csf, gm-csf, and g/gm-csf). under the anova model,
the duncan multiple comparison was performed to compare productions of each cytokine at four growth factor levels (control,
g-csf, gm-csf, and g/gm-csf). anova was also performed
within each cell type (pbmc, t cell, and apc) to evaluate the
effect of growth factor on production of cytokines. all data
were analyzed by sas version 9.1.3 software.

results
gm-csf increases production
of il-12 by pbmc, t cells, and apc
we first studied the effects of gm-csf on production of
il-12 by unseparated human pbmc in vitro. to study the
optimal conditions required for production of il-12, we
tested different combinations of growth factors, culture
times, and maturation stimuli (fig. 1). gm-csf increased
production of il-12 at each time point tested, as compared

mononuclear cells (pbmc): supernatants of pbmc cultures were analyzed for il-12 production by cytokine enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in triplicate. pbmc, t cells, and antigen-presenting cells (apc) were plated and treated with nothing (control), g-csf, gm-csf, or both (g/gm-csf). cultures
were followed by a maturation stimulus with either lipopolysaccharide (lps) or phytohemagglutinin (pha) (fig. 1). (a) pbmc matured with lps, (b)
pbmc matured with pha, (c) t cells matured with pha (mature) or lps (inmature), (d) apc matured with lps (mature) or pha (inmature). bars

to control or g-csf–treated pbmc (fig. 2a and b). the
most efficient time for production of il-12 was after 72
hours of exposure to gm-csf with 24-hour maturation
with either lps or pha (fig. 2a and b). importantly, the
highest il-12 levels were based on exposure time to
gm-csf prior to addition of maturation stimuli. therefore,
48 hours, and not 24 hours, of incubation with gm-csf
followed by either 24 or 48 hours of maturation stimuli
yielded the highest levels. this trend was observed with
both lps and pha. when comparing lps and pha, we
observed a higher production of il-12 on pha-matured
pbmc as compared to lps-matured pbmc (p ! 0.0001,
compare fig. 2a with b).
because our results demonstrated that 48 hours of
gm-csf followed by a 24-hours maturation stimulus
yielded the highest il-12 production, we investigated the
effects of gm-csf on different cellular subsets of pbmc
under these conditions. purified t cells or t-cell–depleted
pbmc (apc) were cultured with no growth factors (control), gm-csf, g-csf, or both. both subsets, when stimulated by gm-csf, produced higher il-12 compared to
control or g-csf (p ! 0.0001; fig. 2c and d). furthermore, activated t cells (pha-stimulated) exposed to
gm-csf had the highest production of il-12 (fig. 2c).

gm-csf also stimulated il-12 production by apc, however, to a lesser extent than t cells (compare highest values
366.22 ng/ml in fig. 2c vs 64.67 ng/ml in fig. 2d).
gm-csf increases production
of  xxxg2296xxx  by pbmc and t cells
production of  xxxg2296xxx  by pbmc after exposure with
gm-csf or g-csf/gm-csf was much higher than that
of control or g-csf at all the time points tested (p !
0.0001; fig. 3a and b). after separating pbmc into t cells
and apc, apc had 10-fold higher production of  xxxg2296xxx 
compared to t cells. however, the effects of gm-csf
were different. gm-csf upregulated  xxxg2296xxx  production
by t cells but not by apc. this suggests that gm-csf
acts predominantly on the t-cell fraction of pbmc to produce  xxxg2296xxx  (fig. 3c and d).
gm-csf increases production
of ifn-g by lps-stimulated pbmc and apc
gm-csf significantly increased production of ifn-g by
pbmc after lps maturation for 24 hours (fig. 4a).
gm-csf did not increase the amount of ifn-g produced
by pha-stimulated pbmc compared to control cells
(fig. 4b). maximum production of ifn-g was observed

gm-csf). cultures were treated for 48 hours with its respective growth factor followed by a maturation stimulus with either lipopolysaccharide (lps) or
phytohemagglutinin (pha) for another 24 hours. (a) pbmc matured with lps, (b) pbmc matured with pha, (c) t cells matured with lps, (d) t cells
matured with pha, apc matured with lps, and apc matured with pha. bars represent the calculated sem from the three separate experiments (*compares
with control and **compares with g-csf, p ! 0.001).

in gm-csf–treated cells in combination with g-csf
(fig. 4a and b). we then tested the effects of gm-csf
on different cell subtypes. gm-csf by itself did significantly increase production of ifn-g in both subsets
(fig. 4c and d). especially, gm-csf abrogated the downregulating effect of g-csf on ifn-g production in both t
cells and apc.

control. g-csf, on the other hand, had a tendency to
skew il-4 production profile, which was not downregulated
by gm-csf. mature t cells were the most significant producers of il-4 (p ! 0.0001, fig. 5b). lps-matured cells
did not have as significant an effect on production of il-4
as pha-matured cells (fig. 5c and d). these results correlated with research found on the literature for g-csf.

effects of gm-csf on the production type 2 cytokines
to further investigate the immunostimulatory properties of
gm-csf, we studied the effects on type 2 cytokines. we
found that in gm-csf–treated pbmc produced significantly less il-10 compared to control and g-csf
(p ! 0.0001, fig. 5a and b). when studying pbmc subsets we found that gm-csf downregulated production of
il-10 in both mature and inmature apc as compared to
control or g-csf (p ! 0.0001). however, activated t cells
treated with gm-csf upregulated il-10 as compared to
both control and g-csf. conversely, g-csf induced higher
il-10 production in t cells and apc and was higher in
apc.
statistically, gm-csf exposure was not significantly
associated with the production of il-4 as compared to

gm-csf preferentially increases dc1
we tested the effect of gm-csf to induce the differentiation of monocytes (dc progenitors) into dc subtypes
expressing  xxxg1208xxx  (dc1) or  xxxg1178xxx  (dc2) by flow cytometry. we observed an overall increase in the percentage of
both dc1 and dc2 when stimulated with gm-csf
(fig. 6). furthermore, the predominant dc was of dc1
phenotype after gm-csf exposure. addition of gm-csf
to g-csf produced similar results.
proliferation of allogeneic t cells

we tested the capacity of gm-csf–exposed monocytes to
induce proliferation of allogeneic t cells. compared to either

monocytes induced a higher proliferation of allogeneic
t cells (p ! 0.001, fig. 7). g-csf did not induce an increased proliferation of allogeneic t cells and was similar
to control cells.

discussion
our study demonstrates the potent immune effects of
gm-csf, which is currently being explored clinically as
an adjuvant in cancer vaccine trials [20,21]. our results indicate that gm-csf stimulates inflammatory cellular and
cytokine responses. specifically, gm-csf significantly
upregulates production of type 1 cytokines (il-12,  xxxg2296xxx , and ifn-g) by pbmc. furthermore, when pbmc are
separated, both t cells and apc upregulated these cytokines. we also observed that gm-csf promotes differentiation of monocytes into dc with a preferential expansion of
dc1 more than dc2, which favors th1 differentiation.
enhanced production of il-2 and il-12 by th1 cells can
activate natural killer cells, further augmenting anti-tumor
activity. in addition, gm-csf–treated monocytes enhance
proliferation of allogeneic t cells. collectively, these

results indicate the robust immune-enhancing functions of
gm-csf as an explanation for anti-tumor activity.
we have recently demonstrated the importance of increased numbers of dc and il-12 levels in predicting
improved clinical outcomes after hsct. patients with
high numbers of dc and high il-12 levels had reduced cancer relapse and improved survival [7,22]. we evaluated
gm-csf as a growth factor that can potentially increase
dc and il-12 and tested this in vitro. our results confirm
our hypothesis by showing that gm-csf stimulates a strong
production of il-12 and type 1 cytokines by human pbmc.
in addition, it also induced the differentiation of monocytes
into dc where dc1 predominated over dc2.
currently g-csf is used as a peripheral blood–
mobilizing agent in hsct and in enhancing neutrophil
recovery in cancer patients [23,24]. however, g-csf is
potentially an immunosuppressive agent because it induces
th2 and dc2 differentiation [25,26]. furthermore, g-csf
decreases inflammatory cytokines, such as il-12 and
 xxxg2296xxx , which leads to a reduction in graft-vs-host disease
in murine models and increased infection after haploidentical transplantation [8,27,28]. our results demonstrate the

opposite effects of gm-csf compared to g-csf with an
increase in type 1 responses and dc1 differentiation. furthermore, addition of gm-csf to g-csf abrogated type
2 cytokine responses induced by the latter, suggesting
that gm-csf can overcome g-csf–induced immune suppression. previously, gm-csf has been used alone and in
combination with g-csf to mobilize hematopoietic stem
and progenitor cells for autologous transplantation [29].
analysis of the clinical outcomes of patients treated with
gm-csf might reveal whether there was a reduced relapsed rate when compared to similar patients mobilized
with g-csf alone.
a significant increase in content of dc in the hematopoietic precursor graft can be achieved by using combinations of gm-csf with g-csf [29]. this combination
shifted the ratio of dc subsets and t-cell phenotype toward
a type 1 in cells mobilized for transplantation [29–31]. the
net result of these studies was a shift in the dc1/dc2 ratio
favoring dc1 in the groups receiving gm-csf and g-csf.
this combination also provokes a marked expansion of dc
locally and systemically [32]. another study showed that
rat respiratory tract dc that were ovalbumin-pulsed and
used in adoptive transfer stimulated type 2 responses, but

its potential to promote a th1/dc1-dominated immune response in transplant recipients, cancer vaccine trials to possibly decrease relapse. in addition, such immune-stimulatory
properties may be of benefit in immune-compromised
patients susceptible to infections. our findings also provide a mechanism of action for gm-csf as an immunestimulatory cytokine. whether these findings represent
a new treatment strategy to induce type 1–dominated
responses in vivo and anti-tumor effects, subsequently
resulting in better prognoses for hsct patients has to
be further investigated.

(gm-csf) on the proliferation of allogeneic t cells by gm-csf–stimulated human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (pbmc): cultures were
analyzed for proliferation by brdu incorporation enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in triplicate. monocytes were treated with nothing (control),
g-csf, or gm-csf. cultures were treated for 48 hours with its respective
growth factor followed by a maturation stimulus with lipopolysaccharide

pretreatment with gm-csf induced production of both
type 1 and type 2 responses [33,34]. our results showed
that gm-csf by itself in vitro can substantially increase
type 1 cytokine response as well as higher dc 1 production
and allogeneic t-cell proliferation. potential mechanisms of
actions of gm-csf for our observations can be explained
by recent publications indicating a role for dc maturation
signals, such as  xxxg2290xxx  induced by lps (as used in our
culture conditions) [35]. furthermore, it appears that appropriate maturation stimuli, as used in our experiments, are
required for il-12 production by dc based on ebner
et al. [36] demonstrating that cd40 ligation and bacteria
are sufficient while monocyte-conditioned media are not.
it is also possible that the effects of gm-csf may be different on pbmc derived from cancer patients as compared
to healthy donors used in our study. future studies may be
considered to address this further.
in conclusion, our results reveal a role for gm-csf in
modulation of an immune response toward a type 1–
dominating functional phenotype. two strategies exist by
which to utilize the immunotherapeutic potential of transplantation: one uses cytokines to mobilize different dc
and t-cell phenotypes in the graft, the other is to administer
posttransplantation cytokines to alter the character of the
dc and t-cell phenotype of the donor cells in the recipient.
our results demonstrate the immune stimulatory properties
of gm-csf and may be further tested in future studies for

we acknowledge critical and helpful comments by dr. sally
