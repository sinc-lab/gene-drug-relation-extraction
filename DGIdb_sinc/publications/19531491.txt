glutarate to the krebs cycle. although there is some debate as to
the directionality of the reaction, the high km for ammonium in
the reductive amination reaction seems to prohibit the reverse
reaction under normal conditions in most organisms (2).  xxxg911xxx 
from animals, but not other kingdoms (3), is allosterically regulated by a wide array of ligands (3–9). gtp (9 –11), and with
⬃100-fold lower affinity, atp (3), is a potent inhibitor of the
reaction and acts by increasing the binding affinity for the product, thereby slowing down enzymatic turnover (11). hydrophobic compounds such as  xxxd2832xxx -coa (12), steroid hormones
(13), and steroid hormone analogs such as diethylstilbestrol (5)
are also potent inhibitors. adp is an activator of  xxxg911xxx  (3, 6, 10,
11, 14) that acts in an opposite manner to gtp by facilitating
product release. leucine is a poor substrate for  xxxg911xxx  but is also
an allosteric activator for the enzyme (8). its activation is akin to
adp but acts at site distinct from adp (15).
the crystal structures of the bacterial (16 –18) and animal
forms (19, 20) of  xxxg911xxx  have shown that the general architecture
and the locations of the catalytically important residues have
remained unchanged throughout evolution. the structure of
 xxxg911xxx  (fig. 1) is essentially two trimers of subunits stacked
directly on top of each other with each subunit being composed
of at least three domains (19 –22). the bottom domain makes
extensive contacts with  xxxg220xxx  from the other trimer. resting
on top of this domain is the “nad binding domain” that has the
conserved nucleotide binding motif. animal  xxxg911xxx  has a long
protrusion, “antenna,” rising above the nad binding domain
that is not found in bacteria, plants, fungi, and the vast majority
of protists. the antenna from each subunit lies immediately
behind the adjacent, counterclockwise neighbor within the
trimer. because these intertwined antennae are only found in
the forms of  xxxg911xxx  that are allosterically regulated by numerous ligands, it is reasonable to speculate that it plays a role in
regulation.
from the structures  xxxg911xxx  alone and complexed with various
ligands, it is clear that  xxxg911xxx  undergoes large conformational
changes during each catalytic cycle (19 –22) (the locations of
these changes are summarized in fig. 1). substrate binds to the
deep recesses of the cleft between the coenzyme binding
domain and the lower domain. coenzyme binds along the
coenzyme binding domain surface of the cleft. upon binding,
the coenzyme binding domain rotates by ⬃18° to firmly close
down upon the substrate and coenzyme (fig. 1, arrow 1). as the
catalytic cleft closes, the base of each of the long ascending
helices in the antenna appears to rotate out in a counterclockwise manner to push against the “pivot” helix of the adjacent
subunit (fig. 1, arrow 2). there is a short helix in the descending
loop of the antenna that becomes distended and shorter as the

mammalian glutamate dehydrogenase ( xxxg911xxx ) is a homohexameric enzyme that catalyzes the reversible oxidative deamination of l-glutamate to 2-oxoglutarate using nad(p)ⴙ as coenzyme. unlike its counterparts from other animal kingdoms,
mammalian  xxxg911xxx  is regulated by a host of ligands. the recently
discovered hyperinsulinism/hyperammonemia disorder showed
that the loss of allosteric inhibition of  xxxg911xxx  by gtp causes
excessive secretion of insulin. subsequent studies demonstrated
that wild-type and hyperinsulinemia/hyperammonemia forms
of  xxxg911xxx  are inhibited by the  xxxd2006xxx ,  xxxd2006xxx  and epicatechin gallate. this was followed by high
throughput studies that identified more stable inhibitors,
including  xxxd2274xxx , gw5074, and bithionol. shown
here are the structures of  xxxg911xxx  complexed with these three compounds.  xxxd2274xxx  forms a ring around the internal cavity in  xxxg911xxx  through aromatic stacking interactions between the
drug and  xxxg911xxx  as well as between the drug molecules themselves. in contrast, gw5074 and bithionol both bind as pairs of
stacked compounds at hexameric 2-fold axes between the
dimers of subunits. the internal core of  xxxg911xxx  contracts when
the catalytic cleft closes during enzymatic turnover. none of the
drugs cause conformational changes in the contact residues, but
all bind to key interfaces involved in this contraction process.
therefore, it seems likely that the drugs inhibit enzymatic turnover by inhibiting this transition. indeed, this expansion/contraction process may play a major role in the inter-subunit communication and allosteric regulation observed in  xxxg911xxx .

mouth closes in a manner akin to an
extending spring (fig. 1, arrow 3).
the pivot helix rotates in a counterclockwise manner along the helical
axes as well as rotating counterclockwise around the trimer 3-fold
axis. finally, the entire hexamer
seems to compress as the mouth
closes (fig. 1, arrow 4). the three
pairs of subunits that sit on top of
each other move as a rigid units
toward each other, compressing the
cavity at the core of the hexamer.
this last conformational change
will be further examined in this
work. allosteric regulation is likely
exacted by controlling some or all of
these conformational changes.
the reason for complex animal
regulation came from studies that
linked  xxxg911xxx  regulation with insulin
and ammonia homeostasis. the
connection between  xxxg911xxx  and insulin regulation was initially estabfigure 1. conformational transitions and locations of ligand binding sites in bovine glutamate dehydrogen- lished using a non-metabolizable

helix of the adjacent subunit (2). the short helix of the descending strand of the antenna becomes extended and
distorted at the carboxyl end (3). finally, the internal cavity of the helix compresses, bringing the three pairs closer tightly correlated with increased
together (4). b shows the structure of adp (green spheres) bound to the apo-form of  xxxg911xxx  and the location of arg-463 glutaminolysis and release of insu(mauve spheres) that is involved in adp activation (22). c shows the location of the inhibitor, gtp (mauve spheres), lin. in addition, it has also been
bound to the nadh (gray spheres), and glutamate (orange spheres) abortive complex. the green arrow notes the
approximate location of one of the two sites (lys-420) modified by 5⬘-fsba (48). comparing b and c, the closing of noted that factors that regulate
the catalytic cleft and the movement of the pivot helix is evident.
 xxxg911xxx  also affect insulin secretion
(24). the in vivo importance of
 xxxg911xxx  in glucose homeostasis was demonstrated by the discovery that a genetic hypoglycemic disorder, the hyperinsulinemia/hyperammonemia (hhs) syndrome, is caused by loss of
gtp regulation of  xxxg911xxx  (25–27). children with hhs have
increased ␤-cell responsiveness to leucine and susceptibility to
hypoglycemia following high protein meals (28). this is likely
due to uncontrolled catabolism of amino acids yielding high
atp levels that stimulate insulin secretion as well as high serum
ammonium levels. during glucose-stimulated insulin secretion
in normal individuals, it has been proposed that the generation
of high energy phosphates inhibits  xxxg911xxx  and promotes conversion of glutamate to glutamine, which, alone or combined,
might amplify the release of insulin (29, 30). further support for
this contention came from studies on the inhibitory effects of
the  xxxd1979xxx  compounds from green tea on bch-stimulated insulin secretion (31). this not only lent support for the
figure 2. link between  xxxg911xxx  and insulin homeostasis. this figure shows the contention that  xxxg911xxx  plays a significant role in insulin homeorole of  xxxg911xxx  in bch stimulated insulin secretion and how  xxxg911xxx  inhibitors affect stasis, but also suggests that the hhs disorder might be directly

inhibitors (32). of the ⬃30,000 compounds tested, ⬃20 demonstrated significant activity. three of the most active compounds,  xxxd2274xxx , gw5074, and bithionol, were chosen for further analysis in this study. as shown here, all three
compounds exhibit essentially non-competitive inhibition of
the reaction and therefore do not compete with either substrate
or coenzyme. structural studies are presented here that demonstrate that six  xxxd2274xxx  (hcp) molecules bind to the
inner core of the  xxxg911xxx  hexamer, forming an internal ring via
aromatic interactions. in contrast, bithionol and gw5074 bind
as pairs between dimers of  xxxg911xxx  subunits further away from the
core of the enzyme. none of these compounds induce significant conformational changes in their immediate vicinity, and
the mechanism of action is not clear from the location of their
binding sites. however, detailed analysis of the various  xxxg911xxx 
complexes shows all of the drugs are binding to contact areas in
the core of the hexamer that appear to be expanding and contracting during catalytic turnover. therefore, inhibition is likely
due interference with this “breathing” process.

megazyme corp. (wicklow, ireland), and tetrahymena  xxxg911xxx 
was isolated as described under “experimental procedures.” all
samples of  xxxg911xxx  were checked for homogeneity using sdspage analysis.
crystallization of the drug complexes—co-crystallization of
 xxxg911xxx  with hcp and gw5074 was performed using the hanging
drop, vapor-diffusion method at room temperature. in both
cases, the drops were formed using a 1:1 mix of protein and
reservoir solutions. for gw5074, the reservoir solution contained 0.1 m sodium phosphate (ph 7.0), 0.5 m  xxxd20xxx ,
0.5 m  xxxd3213xxx , and 7– 8% (w/v)  xxxd2982xxx

on the oxidative deamination reaction—prior to kinetic analysis, aliquots of bovine  xxxg911xxx  (sigma) were extensively dialyzed
against 0.1 m sodium phosphate buffer, ph 7.0, that contained 1
mm edta. the enzyme concentration was adjusted to 1
mg/ml, and the amount of enzyme added to the reaction mixture was adjusted to yield optimal steady-state velocities. all
solutions were made immediately prior to use. enzyme assays
were performed by monitoring reduced coenzyme production
at 340 nm using a beckman coulter du800 spectrophotometer. for all of the kinetic assays, each reaction was done in triplicate in 0.1 m sodium phosphate buffer, ph 7.5. when glutamate was varied, the concentration of nad⫹ was 0.2 mm.
when nad⫹ was varied, a concentration of 50 mm glutamate
was used. to measure the ed50 values of the various drugs, 50
mm glutamate and 0.2 mm nad⫹ were used in the reaction.
when the concentration of glutamate is varied, there is
strong substrate inhibition at high glutamate concentrations

calculated in cns (36) using the
refined coordinates and combined
with the observed structure factors
using ccp4i (39). the mask
included one of the six drug molecules, and real-space averaging was

map was then back-transformed,
and the phases were applied to the
observed structure factors for subsequent averaging. each map was
averaged six times, and the final correlation coefficients were ⬃99% for
each subunit. in the case of hcp,
two molecules of the drug bind in
different orientations to crossdimers of  xxxg911xxx  subunits (e.g. the
deep red and light blue subunits in

from one of these dimers and two
drug molecules, and 3-fold averaging was applied to the map in the

breaks in the lineweaver-burk plots

when glutamate is varied. previous
studies demonstrated also that hcp
also did not affect these phenomena
(32).
these drugs were identified
through high throughput screens at
extremely high coenzyme and substrate concentrations to prevent
selection of their respective analogs,
because such compounds would
likely have undesirable impacts on
multiple metabolic pathways (32).
nevertheless, because gw5074 is a
kinase inhibitor, there was concern
that perhaps it might interfere with
coenzyme binding. therefore,
kinetic studies were performed on
bithionol and gw5074 (fig. 3 and
table 1). for this analysis, data from
the nad⫹-varied steady-state
experiments were analyzed using
lineweaver-burk plots, and the km
and vmax were calculated using linear regression analysis of the velocity of the reaction at high coenzyme
concentration. as is typical for
 xxxg911xxx  with coenzyme varied, there is
a marked break at ⬃0.1 mm nad⫹

deviation from michaelis-menten

does not affect the subunit communication associated with negative
cooperativity, because the break

density of the bound hcp appeared
weaker than when the drug was
added during the crystallization
process. therefore, whereas the
results from the two different data
sets are essentially the same, the following results are from data collected using crystals from the
co-crystallization trials.
from the initial difference maps
(using fo ⫺ fc and model phases),
the bound hcp appeared as peaks
⬎5␴ in the inner core of the
enzyme. to improve the quality of
the drug density and to confirm its
existence, the map was subjected
to six cycles of 3-fold averaging as
described under “experimental
procedures.” although the peak
height of the density is high, some
of the details are more diffuse than
the protein residues surrounding the molecules. because some
of the interactions between the
drug and the protein are not
exactly symmetrical, the diffuse
nature of the density may be due to
alternative binding conformers or
partial substitution. indeed, this
density is significantly stronger
than when the drugs were soaked
into the crystals overnight.

binding pocket is accessible to the

binding geometry of hcp where the
internal cavity is blocked off from

antenna structure. also unlike hcp,

the stacked dimers changes by 2.5–
4%. this concurs with the kinds of
changes shown in fig. 9.
although all of the drug complexes also contained nadph, glutamate, and gtp, these internal distances are not exactly the same as
the closed conformation. interestingly, bithionol (soaked into the
abortive complex crystals) and
gw5074 (co-crystallized with
 xxxg911xxx ) bind to the same site, and the
intersubunit distances are nearly
identical to each other. furthermore, although the intra-trimer distances were compressed by ⬃3% in
the presence of the abortive complex, these drugs appear to limit this
compression to only ⬃1%. it should
be noted that structures of this
abortive complex in the presence of
metals and different buffers yield
essentially the same result as the
closed conformation in the absence
of drugs (data not shown). therefore these differences, although
relatively small compared with
open versus closed conformers in
the absence of drug, do not seem
to be just due to differences in solute. although similar trends are

is represented by a sphere to emphasize the trimer of dimer configuration.
there are four unique distances in the hexamer; between subunits within a
trimer (intra-trimer), between subunits within a dimer (intra-dimer), and two
cross vectors between each subunit and the two opposite subunits on the
other trimer (cross-vectors 1 and 2). the distances from the various complexes

site differences are not as important as the ability of the compounds to form the inter-drug stacking interactions observed
between the bound hcp and bithionol molecules.
there appears to be an evolutionary conservation of the
effect of these drugs on  xxxg911xxx  activity. all three drugs inhibited
tetrahymena  xxxg911xxx  with gw5074 exhibiting the weakest
effects. in the case of bacterial  xxxg911xxx  (e. coli), all three drugs
exhibited significantly weaker effects. nevertheless, hcp was
able to inhibit the e. coli enzyme by ⬃50% at the highest concentrations tested while bithionol inhibited the reaction by

figure 11. effects of the drugs on  xxxg911xxx  from other kingdoms. shown here
is the effect of varying concentrations of the three drugs on  xxxg911xxx  from bovine
(red lines), tetrahymena (green lines), and e. coli (blue lines). curve fitting results
are summarized in table 4.

⬃40% at the highest concentrations tested. the results with
tetrahymena were not entirely surprising, because the residues
in contact with the drugs are highly conserved between the
tetrahymena and bovine forms of  xxxg911xxx  (43). however, these
same residues are not well conserved in the bacterial form (19).
nevertheless, the binding pockets for these compounds are
found in bacterial  xxxg911xxx  (e.g. clostridium  xxxg911xxx  (17)). there is a
clear pocket that is accessible to the exterior solvent and is in a
homologous location as the bithionol and gw5074 binding
site. because bacterial  xxxg911xxx  does not have the antenna region,
the entire inner core is exposed to solvent. although a higher
degree of inhibition would have been more convincing, the fact
that hcp and gw5074 have any effect on the enzymatic activity suggests that the concerted conformational changes
observed in mammalian  xxxg911xxx  may have very ancient origins
and are most certainly in play in the ciliate form of the enzyme.
it is also important to note that hcp and bithionol are known
anthelmintic (expel or kill parasites) agents, but their mode of
action is unclear. given that both of these compounds inhibit
 xxxg911xxx  from such diverse sources, it seems possible that they, at
least in part, act via  xxxg911xxx  inhibition.
as we have recently proposed (44), the complex motions
within  xxxg911xxx  may have initially evolved to improve catalytic
efficiency. the negative cooperativity and extensive subunit
communication may have evolved to conserve and transfer the
energy involved in substrate binding to one subunit to facilitate
product release from adjacent subunits (49). as is clear in the
case of these drugs and the naturally occurring allosteric regulators, this complex ballet of motion creates numerous sites by
which ligands can bind and modulate catalytic activity. this has
allowed allostery in  xxxg911xxx  to gradually evolve in complexity to
create new functions and roles rather than creating entirely new
gene products to accommodate the changing needs of the cell
(e.g. linkage between amino acid catabolism and insulin secretion). although it seems that  xxxg911xxx  regulation is overly complex
for an enzyme involved in such a mundane chemical reaction, it
is in fact remarkable that this allostery can adequately control a
single enzyme that is apparently crucial to regulate central
nervous system levels of glutamate, ureagenesis in the liver, and
insulin secretion in the pancreas.
