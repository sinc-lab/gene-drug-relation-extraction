the methotrexate (mtx) rescue agent  xxxd2209xxx  (cpdg2) rapidly hydrolyses mtx to the inactive metabolite dampa
(4-[[2,4-diamino-6-(pteridinyl)methyl]-methylamino]- xxxd306xxx ) and glutamate in patients with mtx-induced renal failure and
delayed mtx excretion. dampa is thought to be an inactive metabolite of mtx because it is not an effective inhibitor of the mtx
target enzyme  xxxg631xxx . dampa is eliminated more rapidly than mtx in these patients, which suggests a nonrenal
route of elimination. in a phase ii study (may 1997 – march 2002), cpdg2 was administered intravenously to 82 patients at a median
dose of 50 u kg1 (range 33 – 60 u kg1). eligible patients for this study had serum mtx concentrations of 410 mm at 36 h or 45 mm
at 42 h after start of mtx infusion and documented renal failure (serum creatinine x1.5 times the upper limit of normal).
immediately before cpdg2 administration, a median mtx serum level of 11.93 mm (range 0.52 – 901 mm) was documented.
 xxxd2209xxx  was given at a median of 52 h (range 25 – 178 h) following the start of an mtx infusion of 1 – 12 g m2 4 –
36 h1 and resulted in a rapid 97% (range 73 – 99%) reduction of the mtx serum level. toxicity related to cpdg2 was not observed.
toxicity related to mtx was documented in about half the patients; four patients died despite cpdg2 administration due to severe
myelosuppression and septic complications. in conclusion, administration of cpdg2 is a well-tolerated, safe and a very effective way
of mtx elimination in delayed excretion due to renal failure.

high-dose methotrexate (hd-mtx) of more than 1 g m2 body
surface area, administered by a prolonged intravenous infusion
with  xxxd2462xxx  (lv, d,l- xxxd2462xxx ) rescue, has
demonstrated clinical activity in malignancies and diseases, such
as acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, lymphoma, osteosarcoma, and
head and neck cancer.
methotrexate is primarily excreted by the renal route. it may
cause acute nephrotoxicity, which is presumed to result from its
precipitation or its relatively insoluble metabolites in acidic urine.
this nephrotoxicity leads to delayed mtx elimination, ineffective
rescue and a marked increase of other nonhaematological and
haematological toxicities associated with mtx, such as myelosuppression, oro-gastrointestinal mucositis and dermatitis. in early
studies using hd-mtx, severe toxicity occurred in approximately
10% of patients and there was a 6% mortality rate (ahmad et al,
1978). the introduction of pretreatment hydration, alkalinisation
of urine, routine monitoring of serum mtx concentrations and
postinfusion guided lv rescue has decreased the incidence of
severe and life-threatening toxicity after hd-mtx from 10% to less
than 1% (jüergens et al, 1983; allegra, 1990). however, severe

nephrotoxicity of hd-mtx leading to potentially lethal toxicity
still occurs.
for patients with decreased mtx clearance due to renal
dysfunction, therapeutic options are few and of limited efficacy.
when serum mtx concentrations are persistently greater than
10 – 100 mm, high doses of lv are not likely to completely reverse
the toxicity of mtx (goldman and levy, 1968; pinedo et al, 1976;
frei et al, 1980; grem et al, 1991).
thymidine may be used in case of mtx toxicity, but due to its
rapid clearance it must be administered in high doses by
continuous infusion (ensminger and frei, 1977; howell et al,
1978; howell et al, 1980; van den bongard et al, 2001). neither lv
nor thymidine has any effect on the underlying problem of delayed
mtx elimination. peritoneal dialysis is ineffective, most likely due
to a combination of factors including the protein binding, the high
degree of ionisation and the low lipid solubility of mtx (ahmad
et al, 1978). haemodialysis and haemoperfusion have variable
efficacy and usually produce only transient decreases of plasma
mtx concentrations (gibson et al, 1978; relling et al, 1988; saland
et al, 2002). alternative methods to treat persistently elevated mtx
levels are therefore needed.
the carboxypeptidase g class of enzymes hydrolyse the cterminal glutamate residue from  xxxd2146xxx  and classical antifolates,
such as mtx, rendering them inactive (levy and goldman, 1967;
chabner et al, 1972, goldman, 1975).
carboxypeptidase g1 (cpdg1) was originally extracted from
pseudomonas stutzeri. during the 1970s, cpdg1 was administered

patients and methods
patients
study design the study was a prospective, open, nonrandomised,
multicentre trial. the primary study centres were in bonn, berlin
and vienna. their task consisted of consultation and emergency
dispatch of cpdg2 for patients with mtx intoxication. the
substance was requested by 50 different hospitals in 13 different
countries (austria, belgium, czechia, france, germany, greece,
italy, israel, norway, slovakia, spain, sweden and switzerland).
patient eligibility patients of any age were eligible if they had (1)
serum mtx concentration of 410 mm at 36 h or of 45 mm at 42 h
or of 43 mm at 48 h after start of mtx infusion, and (2) decreased
diuresis (less than 50% excretion of the input hydration) or (3) a
serum creatinine (creas) 41.5 times the upper limit of normal and
documented increase of creas during the infusion period.

treatment
 xxxd2209xxx  administration recombinant cpdg2 was
manufactured by the centre for applied microbiology and
research (salisbury, uk) and supplied in lyophilised form with
vials containing 1000 u of enzyme activity. the vials were each
resuspended in 1 ml of sterile isotonic saline; further dilution with
sterile isotonic saline (1 : 5 or 1 : 10) was recommended.  xxxd2209xxx  was administered at a dose of 50 u kg1 over 5 min
intravenously by an infusion pump or by bolus injection.
following each dose of cpdg2, serum mtx concentrations were
determined. patients who experienced a decrease in serum mtx
concentration greater than one logarithm following cpdg2
administration but still had serum mtx concentrations 41 mm
might receive additional doses of cpdg2 with the approval of the
principal investigator of the study.
 xxxd2462xxx   xxxd2462xxx  administration had to be stopped 4 h
prior to cpdg2 and readministered 1 h following enzyme injection.
the recommended lv dose during the first 24 h after the cpdg2
injection was 100 mg m2 every 6 h followed by an increased rescue
for 5 days according to the scheme recommended in the all bfm
95 protocol (schrappe et al, 1995).
& 2005 cancer research uk

patient monitoring patients were evaluated daily for signs and
symptoms of mtx toxicity. complete blood counts with differential, bilirubin and alt, ast were determined at least twice
weekly. recovery of renal function was documented daily by
serum creatinine. the nonhaematological (i.e. renal, liver,
neurological, gastrointestinal toxicity and infectious complications) and haematological toxicity of mtx and side effects
of cpdg2 (especially allergic reactions) were determined according
to national cancer institute common toxicity criteria (ctc)
version 2.0.
sampling for determination of mtx concentration edta samples for mtx determination were obtained immediately before and
15, 30, 60 and 120 min following the dose of cpdg2, and then once
daily until recovery of kidney function and decrease of mtx serum
levels to less than 0.1 mm. most of the local hospitals determined
the mtx level immediately with the methods such as fluorescence
polarisation immunoassay (tdx) or enzyme-multiplied immunotechnique (emit). in a few centres, additional blood samples for
analysis by high-pressure liquid chromatography (hplc) were
placed on ice, and serum was rapidly separated by centrifugation.
to inactivate cpdg2, the serum samples were heated to greater
than 801c for 5 min in a water bath or treated with 1 n hcl to give a
final concentration of 0.1 n hydrochloric acid. if the enzyme
activity in the samples was not fully stopped, mtx in the sample
might continue to be degraded after collection. serum was stored
at 201c until time of analysis. all serum samples were sent on dry
ice to a central laboratory where they were stored at 201c until
analysis by hplc.

methods
dampa, the catabolic product of cpdg2 action on mtx, is known
to crossreact with mtx in most commercial immunological mtx
assays (allegra, 1990; albertioni et al, 1996; widemann et al, 1997).
consequently, mtx concentrations determined by commercial
laboratories are unreliable following treatment with cpdg2.
methotrexate must be assayed by a specific hplc or enzyme
inhibition method.
high-pressure liquid chromatography method serum mtx was
measured by hplc using a modification of a previously reported
method (brandsteterova et al, 1990). after solid phase extraction
using c18 cartridges (watersoasist hlb 3 cm3, 60 mg (waters,
eschborn, germany)), samples were injected onto a 3 mm,
supelcosilt lc-18-db 15 cm  4.6 mm (sulpelco, münchen, germany) radial compression analytical column with a supelquardt
lc-18-db 5 mm (sulpelco, münchen, germany) guard column and
eluted isocratically with 80 : 20 (v v1) 0.1 mol l1 sodium phosphate (ph 6.8) : methanol (lichrosolvs) at a flow rate of
1.2 ml min1. eluent was monitored using a waters 490 uv
adjustable wavelength detector at a wavelength of 310 nm
(thermoquest, egelsbach, germany).
under these conditions, the retention times for mtx, dampa
and the internal standard 4-[[2,4-diamino-6-(pteridinyl)methyl]
amino]- xxxd306xxx  (dm-apa) were approximately 5.6, 9.5 and
3.5 min, respectively. the peak areas were evaluated using the
chromquest software (2.5.1, 1998, thermoquest, egelsbach,
germany). methotrexate and dampa were corrected by means
of an internal standard in combination with a calibration curve.

statistical analysis
patient data were collected consecutively, recorded on data sheets
prepared centrally beforehand, checked by the principal investigator and recorded in a protected database at the university of
bonn. the biometric analysis was performed for all eligible
patients who were evaluable (1) for response to the study

clinical studies

successfully to a small number of patients with brain tumours and
to one patient with pre-existing renal failure after mtx administration. however, the bacterial source for cpdg1 is no longer
available (bertino et al, 1974; abelson et al, 1978; minton et al,
1983).
a recombinant form of cpdg2, cloned from pseudomonas strain
rs-16, is now available as an investigational drug (minton et al,
1983; sherwood et al, 1985).  xxxd2209xxx  hydrolyses mtx
rapidly to the inactive metabolites dampa (4-[[2,4-diamino-6(pteridinyl)methyl]-methylamino]- xxxd306xxx ) and glutamate. in
contrast to cpdg1, cpdg2 has a higher affinity for mtx (km
8 mm) than lv (km 120 mm) and 5-methyltetrahydrofolate (km
35 mm), the primary circulating metabolite of lv. in studies
performed in rhesus monkeys, a single cpdg2 dose of 50 units
(u) kg1 lowered serum mtx steady-state concentration from
10 mm to nontoxic levels of o0.05 mm within 30 min (adamson et al,
1992). in addition, the bolus injection of cpdg2 (a dose of
50 u kg1 in combination with lv and partial thymidine rescue)
resulted in a rapid 95 – 99% reduction of plasma levels of mtx in
patients with renal dysfunction after hd-mtx (widemann et al,
1995, 1997; zoubek et al, 1995).
this study will demonstrate the feasibility, effectiveness and
toxicity of an emergency therapy with cpdg2 in a large european
patient collective with acute mtx intoxication and renal failure.

immediately before cpdg2 administration, a median mtx serum
level of 11.93 mm (range 0.52 – 901 mm) was documented (n ¼ 58).
a single dose of 50 u cpdg2 per kg body weight was intended. a
vial cpdg2 contains 1000 u dry frozen. in all, 57 of 58 evaluable
patients received a dose of between 33 and 60 u cpdg2 per kg
body weight (median 50 u kg1). one patient received only a dose
of 17 u cpdg2 kg1, although the correct amount was available.
 xxxd2209xxx  was administered at a median of 52 h (range
25 – 178 h) following the start of an mtx infusion of 1.5 – 12 g m2
over 4 – 36 h and was well tolerated. at 15 min after cpdg2
administration, the mtx serum level of these patients was reduced
by around 87%.

the mtx levels at the time of contact were between 0.52 and
1082 mm (median 18.0 mm) (n ¼ 65). two patients were included in
the study with mtx levels of 0.52 mm at 94 h (case 1) and 1 mm at
142 h (case 2) after start of mtx and a serum creatinine of six-fold
of the initial value. a total of 12 patients had no documented
increase of serum creatinine at the time of contact in contrast to
the inclusion criteria. despite the absent renal failure, the principal
investigator (ub) decided to give cpdg2 due to very high mtx
levels at a late time of contact.

 xxxd2209xxx  resulted in a rapid reduction of serum mtx
concentrations in all patients. the mtx concentration determined
with immunological mtx detection such as tdx or emit showed
a median decrease of the mtx level of about 87% (range 70 – 99%)
15 min after cpdg2 administration. subsequent samples also
showed an ongoing decrease of mtx concentrations. additionally,
the mtx concentrations after cpdg2 administration were
determined by the hplc method. the mtx levels estimated by
hplc 15 min after the first cpdg2 injection decreased by a median
of 97% (range 73 – 99%) (figure 1). almost immediately after
cpdg2 administration, dampa was detectable at a concentration
comparable to the serum concentration of mtx before cpdg2.

in all, 50% of the patients had a reduced karnowsky index (p60%)
due to the mtx intoxication. gastrointestinal complaints with
nausea and diarrhoea were frequent. severe stomatitis (ctc scale
x2) occurred in 33% of the patients. a total of 66% of the patients
showed an increase of serum creatinine of more than 1.5 times of
the initial value before mtx therapy. increased liver values based
on increased gpt/got were documented in 58% of the patients
with ctc scale x2. only a small number of patients suffered highgrade toxicity of lung and heart/circulation. in five and six
patients, respectively, a mild peripheral and/or central neurotoxicity was observed. two patients suffered from severe central

nine patients received an additional dose of cpdg2, because
their serum mtx concentrations determined by immunological
methods remained higher than 1 mm after the first dose of cpdg2.
the first dose of cpdg2 resulted in a median decrease of 88%
(table 2). the second dose of cpdg2 did not result in a significant
further decline in the serum mtx concentration. five patients with
an mtx level at a median of 8.9 mm (range 3.1 – 77.6 mm) before the
second cpdg2 injection showed a second decrease at a median of
26% (range 5 – 70%). an additional two patients showed an
increase after second cpdg2 injection of 2 and 26%. in one
patient, the mtx level after the second dose of cpdg2 is not
known and in one case the time between the first and second
injections was only 1.5 h and there was no mtx level within the
documented level. all patients who received a second dose showed
a clearly limited kidney function with median creas of
274.4 mmol l1 (range 168.2 – 654.9 mmol l1) before the second
administration.

nine patients received a second dose of cpdg2. one patient
received an additional third dose of cpdg2. six of these nine
patients suffered from an osteosarcoma and received an mtx
therapy of 12 g m2 over 4 h. an additional three patients suffered
from all and nhl and received mtx infusion of 5 g m2 24 h1
(n ¼ 2) or 8 g m2 6 h1 (n ¼ 1), respectively. the median time point
of the first cpdg2 dose in these patients was 37.5 h after the start of
mtx infusions. the second dose was given at a median of 6 h
(range 1.5– 90 h) after the first dose. one patient received a second
dose of cpdg2 1.5 h after the first dose of cpdg2 due to logistics.

methotrexate-related mortality
four patients died due to severe myelosuppression and septic
complications 7 – 22 days following the mtx infusion. three
patients (table 4, cases 1, 2 and 4) had very high mtx
concentrations several hours after the start of mtx, which were
lowered by the administration by cpdg2 insufficiently. thus,
progressive renal failure and fatal septic complications were
observed. in an additional patient (case 3), the mtx concentration
was lowered by cpdg2 adequately without progressive renal
failure. this patient died due to prolonged myelosuppression and
its complications (pulmonary haemorrhage due to pulmonary
aspergillosis), which were caused by the mtx intoxication and the
progressive underlying disease (t-cell all) too.
british journal of cancer (2005) 92(3), 480 – 487

discussion
methotrexate-induced toxicity is frequently associated with
delayed mtx excretion due to renal dysfunction. delayed mtx
excretion leads to prolonged drug exposure and the potential for
severe life-threatening toxicity. patients with impaired renal
function prior to the mtx infusion, of advanced age or receiving
concomitant nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or other
nephrotoxic substances are at an increased risk of developing
renal dysfunction during mtx infusion. in this study, a preexisting reduced kidney function was known before initiating the
mtx therapy in only one patient. all other patients showed
increased mtx concentrations unexpectedly without risk factors.

rescue with lv can prevent toxicity but has no effect on delayed
mtx excretion.
 xxxd2209xxx  rescue offers the distinct advantage of
providing an alternative, rapid route of elimination of mtx by
enzymatically catabolising the drug to the inactive metabolite dampa.
& 2005 cancer research uk

dampa is a minimal inhibitor of  xxxg631xxx  and
less soluble than mtx in acidic ph. the faster elimination of
dampa by comparison with mtx in patients with renal failure,
who received cpdg2, is due to the extrarenal elimination of
dampa (widemann et al, 2000). after systemic exposure to

clinical studies

cpdg2, dampa serum concentrations are equivalent to mtx
concentrations prior to cpdg2 (compare figure 1). because of the
risk of additional nephrotoxicity of dampa, patients must
continue to receive fluid hydration and alkalisation.
after the initial dose of cpdg2, all patients experienced a rapid
(o1 h) and marked (497%) decrease in serum mtx concentration (determined by hplc).
in the first years of this study, nine patients received a second dose
of cpdg2 not resulting in a further marked decrease of the mtx
concentration. this could be the result of high dampa concentrations
inhibiting the hydrolysis of mtx by cpdg2 (widemann et al, 1997).
in addition, substantial crossreactivity of the mtx antibodies
with dampa used in immunoassays results in overestimation of
serum mtx concentrations. therefore, the mtx and dampa
serum concentration after cpdg2 must be monitored by another
technique, such as hplc. the mtx levels estimated by hplc
decreased in median to less than 3% (range 1 – 27%) of the initial
values 15 min after cpdg2 injection.
due to its molecular size, cpdg2 is restricted to the extracellular
compartment, and the intracellular mtx concentration is initially
unaffected by its use. in time, the changed equilibrium between
intracellular and extracellular mtx will result in the efflux of
intracellular mtx back into the serum, resulting in a rise of serum
mtx levels some hours after cpdg2 administration, but this is a
relatively slow process. for this reason, rescue with lv must be
continued following the cpdg2 administration.
in this study, six of 65 patients were treated additionally by
haemofiltration and/or haemodialysis. these methods must be
repeated continuously or daily, in order to reduce the mtx level to
nontoxic concentrations. a further risk of these methods results
from the necessary vascular entrance, as well as the risk of bleeding
secondary to heparinisation and thrombocytopenia. the effectiveness of these procedures cannot be evaluated from our data. three
patients deceased despite these approaches.
in total, four patients died despite cpdg2 injection due to severe
myelosuppression and septic complications 7 – 22 days following
the mtx infusion. the probable reasons for the lethal complications during a prolonged myelosuppression were (1) very high
mtx level with an inadequate decrease of mtx levels after the
second cpdg2 injection, (2) delayed cpdg2 injection (143.5 h after
the start of mtx infusion), (3) a progressive underlying disease (tcell all) and (4) inadequate treatment of severe anaemia in a
patient who was a jehovah witness and refused treatment.
in summary, systemic administration of cpdg2 followed by
long-term lv is highly effective in rescuing patients at high risk of
life-threatening mtx toxicity.  xxxd2209xxx  is safe and well
tolerated. no severe side effects were observed in this study.

administration of cpdg2 is most beneficial for patients with
mtx-induced renal failure, especially if it is administered within
48 – 72 h after the start of mtx infusion.
for the future, it might be helpful to differentiate between
patients with extremly high mtx concentrations and severel renal
failure and patients with moderately high mtx concentration and
renal failure. since additional injections at cpdg2 did not result in
a significant further decrease of mtx levels, one initial high dose
of 100 u kg1 cpdg2 for patients with extremely high mtx
concentrations (for example, 4100 mmol l1 at 48 h after mtx
start and renal failure) may be more effective. for the patients with
moderately high mtx levels and renal failure, the application of
50 u kg1 seems to be sufficient. due to the high costs of the drug,
it may be discussed whether an application of 25 u kg1 cpdg2
would not be sufficient to lower the mtx levels to nontoxic
concentrations in patients with marginal high mtx concentrations
and renal failure.
the therapy with cpdg2 should always be accompanied by a
sufficient hydration, alkalisation and a long-term lv therapy, in
order to counterbalance the intracellular mtx. haemofiltration or
haemodialysis might be helpful in oliguric or anuric renal failure.
in individual cases with renal failure, severe and lethal courses may
occur despite a cpdg2 application, in particular if delayed cpdg2
administration did not prevent overt toxicity.
