alkaptonuria is a rare autosomal recessive disorder of metabolism caused by
deficiency of homogentisic acid oxidase and resulting in accumulation of
homogentisic acid in collagenous structures. it is characterized by homogentisic
aciduria, bluish-black discoloration of connective tissues (ochronosis) and
arthropathy of large joints. less common manifestations include cardiovascular
abnormalities, renal, urethral and prostate calculi. bone fractures are unusual in
ochronosis.
in this report, we describe a woman, 69 years of age, with a history of dark urine
since childhood and progressive pigmentation of the skin, sclera, and auricular
cartilages. she had severe arthropathy requiring total joint replacement in both of
her knees and right hip. she also had severe aortic stenosis requiring valve
replacement, and asymptomatic nephrolithiasis. she presented with a low trauma
fracture of the distal femur despite two years of alendroate therapy.
we review the etiology, pathogenesis, clinical presentation, diagnosis and
treatment of alkaptonuric ochronosis. early detection is important for prevention
and treatment of multiple systems.  xxxd2735xxx , a potent inhibitor of
 xxxg1071xxx , dramatically reduces production and
urinary excretion of homogentisic acid; however, the long-term efficacy and side
effects of such therapy are unknown. identifying the gene for alkaptonuria offers
the potential for a new therapeutic approach (replacement therapy with a
recombinant enzyme) in the treatment of alkaptonuric ochronosis.

alkaptonuria, a rare autosomal recessive disorder of phenylalanine and tyrosine
metabolism caused by deficiency in homogentisate 1,2-dioxygenase activity,
leads to accumulation of large amounts of homogentisic acid. homogentisic acid
is excreted in urine, turning dark brown or black upon oxygenation and
alkalinization. homogentisic acid is deposited as an oxidized and polymerised
pigment (ochronotic pigment) in various tissues and organs binding irreversibly
to collagen and causing bluish-black pigmentation (ochronosis).
alkaptonuria affects between 1 in 250,000 to 1 in 1,000,000 people,1-3 although
in some areas such as slovakia and the dominican republic, the incidence is
much higher (e.g., up to 1 in 19,000 in slovakia4).

the most common clinical features are discoloration of the
urine; pigmentation of the skin, sclerae, and ear cartilage;
and ochronotic arthropathy affecting mainly the vertebral
discs and large joints. less common manifestations include
renal, urethral and prostate calculi and cardiovascular
abnormalities, especially valvular disease. few reports of
bone fracture (mainly vertebral) have been published,5-8 and
none have documented distal femur fractures.
we report a case history of a patient with severe multiple
system ochronosis who underwent three joint replacements,
an aortic valve replacement, and presented with a low
trauma fracture of the distal femur. the disease history,
etiology, pathogenesis, clinical presentation and treatment
are reviewed.

case report
a woman, 69 years of age, was transferred from a district
hospital with a low trauma fracture of her left distal femur
that she reported occurred as she walked past a tennis court
and “twisted her body” during an attempt to pick up and
throw a stray tennis ball over the fence surrounding the
court. she stated that she heard a crack in her left leg and
then the knee gave way. she developed severe pain in the leg
and was unable to bear any weight on it. x-ray examination
showed a fracture of the left distal femur.

stained, magnification = 100x)

the patient’s medical history was remarkable for progressive
degenerative arthritis affecting the hips, knees, shoulders,
and spine beginning in her late 40s. a diagnosis of
ochronosis was made by radiological exam, and alkaptonuria
was confirmed 10 years after the first presentation. at the
age of 62 years she underwent total replacement of the right
hip because of intractable pain, no improvement with
non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and physiotherapy,
and restricted mobility and sitting tolerance of less that half
an hour. two years later she underwent bilateral knee
replacement. following these operations she was able to
walk without walking aids. at 66 years of age, she received
an aortic valve replacement (pericardial prosthesis) for
severe calcified aortic valvular stenosis with a peak
trans-valvular gradient of 90 mm hg. at surgery, severe
annular calcification extending into the left ventricular
outflow tract and dark blue discoloration of the valve cusps
and aortic wall were noted. microscopic examination of the
aortic valve leaflets revealed nodular calcification, and
ochronotic dark pigment within the areas of calcification
and focally in the non-calcified valvular tissue (figure 1).
angiography demonstrated minor coronary artery disease;
the left ventricle was hypertrophied but functioning well
(ejection fraction 60%). a year later, at 67 years of age, she
was diagnosed with low-grade papillary transitional cell
carcinoma of the bladder. no invasion was identified on
repeated biopsies (stage pta). the same year she sustained a
low trauma fracture of the right distal radius. treatment with
alendronate and calcium was initiated at this time. the
patient complained of chronic dull pain and stiffness in her
lower back and shoulders, and previously noted brown black

pigmentation in the sclera of the eyes, face, ears and palms.
black discoloration of her undergarments was noticed since
childhood.
the patient’s family history was unremarkable for genetic
disorders, including alkaptonuria. her parents were not
consanguineous.
her medications included aspirin, celecoxib, atorvastatin,
calcium and alendronate for the previous 2 years. she had
never used antimalarial, dopamine or phenolic drugs. before
starting the anti-osteoporotic therapy, bone mineral density
t score at the femoral neck measured by dual-energy x-ray
absorptiometry was – 3.21, and after 21 months of treatment
was – 2.60. lumbar spine bone mineral density was elevated
on both occasions with t score values +1.92 and +1.74,
respectively.
general examination revealed brown pigmentation of the
sclera of both eyes (in the nasal and temporal regions), the
cartilage of the external ears, the face, thenar, hypothenar,
fingertips, and dorsum of both hands and the soles of the
feet (figure 2). the pigment deposits were not tender. the
visible mucous membranes were normal. her weight was
49 kg with a body mass index of 21.7 kg/m2. she had
moderate thoracic kyphosis, loss of lumbar lordosis with
limited range of motion and tenderness in the mid-lower
thoracic and lumbar spine. range of motion in both
shoulders was also reduced and more painful on the right
side. the joints of the hands and feet were not affected.
cardiovascular examination and echocardiogram were
consistent with an artificial aortic valve and left ventricular
hypertrophy. the electrocardiogram showed sinus rhythm at
75 beats/min and bifascicular block (right and left bundle
alkaptonuric ochronosis

branch block). the respiratory, neurological, and abdominal
examinations were normal.
laboratory analyses included complete blood count,
erythrocyte sedimentation rate,  xxxg520xxx , urea,
creatinine,  xxxd3472xxx , liver and thyroid function tests,
calcium, phosphate, magnesium,  xxxg1885xxx 
(5.6 pmol/l), 25-oh vitamin d (61 nmol/l), vitamin b12,
folate, and ferritin, as well as urinalysis. all tests were
within normal ranges. rheumatoid factor and hla-b27
were negative. the patient’s freshly passed urine turned
black immediately after sodium hydroxide was added
(figure 3).
radiological examination of the thoracolumbar spine
showed calcification in the intervertebral discs at t7/8 and
t12 to s1, gas (“vacuum phenomenon”) in the l3/4 disc,
marked narrowing of intervertebral disc spaces, and
endplate osteophytes most prominent in the thoracic and
upper lumbar spine, and calcification of the lower costal
cartilages (figure 4a). radiographs of the shoulders
disclosed marked narrowing of the joint space and
subchondral sclerosis with calcification in the humeral
heads.
a whole body scan with technetium 99m dicarboxypropane
 xxxd2553xxx  demonstrated an increased uptake in the mid
thoracic, and upper and mid lumbar regions suggestive of
degenerative changes. there was also increased uptake in
the manubriosternal region. arthritic changes were present
in the glenohumeral joints bilaterally. the right hip
prosthesis and bilateral knee prostheses were noted with
normal periprosthetic activity, although there was evidence
of mild arthritic change in the patellofemoral compartment
on the right side (figure 4b). the radiological and

scintigraphic findings were confirmed by computed
tomography that also showed a calcific density in the upper
pole of the left kidney (a small calculus), but no renal
obstruction was noted.
the patient had an open reduction with internal fixation
(retrograde nail insertion) of the fractured left femur (figure 4c).
her operation and hospital stay were uneventful, and she
was discharged to her home.

discussion
the earliest verified case of ochronosis was described in an
egyptian mummy dating to 1500 b.c. radiological and
biochemical examination of the intervertebral discs, hips
and knees was used to confirm the diagnosis.9,10 in 1584,
scribonius reported a boy who passed urine as black as
ink.11 the term alkaptonuria was first used in 1859 by
boedeker to describe urine discoloration due to a reducing
compound. the compound was identified as homogentisic
acid in 1891 by wolkow and baumann.3 in 1866, virchow
called the condition ochronosis (meaning “yellow disease”
in greek) because the accumulated pigment in the
connective tissues appears as ochre (yellow) when examined
microscopically.12
at the beginning of the last century alkaptonuria was the
first disorder to be found to conform to the applicability of
the rediscovered mendelian laws of autosomal recessive
inheritance13 and became a cornerstone of the fundamental
concept of “inborn errors of metabolism” (mendelian
inheritance in man number [mckusick] 203500). a half
century later, the specific enzyme defect in the liver of a
patient with alkaptonuria was demonstrated to be a
deficiency of homogentisic acid 1,2-dioxygenase (hgo)
activity, one of six enzymes required for catabolism of the
aromatic amino acids phenylalanine and tyrosine.14 the
human hgo gene locus has been mapped to chromosome
3q21-q23.2,15,16 in the last decade the hgo gene has been
cloned, characterized, and its promoter region identified.17,18
a total of 84 mutations impairing this enzyme have been
found in the hgo gene from humans and model organisms,
and 43 of these mutations result in single amino acid
substitutions.19 more than 40 different mutations have been
identified in approximately 100 unrelated patients with
alkaptonuria from many different countries.20 the most
widespread hgo mutations are probably old mutations that
have spread throughout europe and asia during human
migration.21,22
alkaptonuria is characterized by a remarkable allelic
heterogeneity. affected persons are either homozygous or
compound heterozygous for loss of function mutation(s) in
hgo. in a recent series, 46 out of 58 patients were
compound heterozygotes and no correlation between the
presence or absence of any type of hgo mutation and either
level of urinary homogentisic acid excretion or severity of
disease was found.3

inability to convert homogentisic acid to maleylacetoacetic
acid results in accumulation of homogentisic acid and a
product of its oxidation, benzoquinone, which induces tissue
injury. this accumulation causes the classic clinical triad:
(1) homogentisic aciduria which presents at birth
(pathognomonic sign: urine blackens on standing when
oxidized or alkalinized); (2) gradual development of
ochronosis after 20 to 30 years of age (deposition of
polymers of oxidized homogentisic acid in connective
tissues leads to intensive eumelanin-like pigmentation of
skin, sclera, cartilages, etc); and (3) degenerative ochronic
arthropathies usually in the fourth decade of life. other
important but more rare consequences of alkaptonuric
ochronosis are cardiovascular and urinary tract involvement.
our patient had dark urine and demonstrated extensive,
progressive pigmentation of the skin, sclera, and auricular
cartilages; advanced spondyloarthropathy necessitating three
joint replacements; severe aortic stenosis requiring valve
replacement; asymptomatic nephrolithiasis; and low trauma
fractures of the radius and distal femur.
it has been suggested that clinical manifestations of
alkaptonuric ochronosis are usually delayed, not appearing
until the fourth decade of life because with ageing the renal
clearance of homogentisic acid decreases.23 case reports of
ochronotic nephropathy and renal failure further emphasized
the role of renal tubular secretion in eliminating
homogentisic acid from the body.24-26 however, there were
no signs of renal impairment in our patient indicating the
role of other mechanisms contributing to the severity of the
disease. indeed, of 58 subjects with alkaptonuric ochronosis,
reduced creatinine clearance was documented only in one
patient with diabetic nephropathy.3
ochronotic spondyloarthropathy is the most common
complication of alkaptonuria affecting large weight bearing
joints and later the shoulders. typically, involvement of the
large peripheral joints usually occurs several years after
spinal involvement. it is suggested that the characteristic
extensive calcification and vacuum phenomena in
ochronotic intervertebral discs are pathologically different
from degenerative disc disease and are related to cartilage
brittleness and fragmentation similar to that in the affected
peripheral joints.27 in contrast to rheumatoid arthritis, the
small joints of the hands and feet are usually not affected,
and in contrast to  xxxg1055xxx , bamboo spine,
annular ossification, syndesmophytes, erosion, and fusion of
sacroiliac joints do not occur.
it was claimed that arthropathy, especially axial
involvement, is more severe in hla-b27-positive
individuals.27,28 coexistence of ochronosis and rheumatoid
arthritis,29,30  xxxg1055xxx ,31,33 or chondrocalcinosis34
has also been reported.
our patient lacked rheumatoid factor and the hla-b27
antigen. she did not have signs of rheumatoid arthritis,

 xxxg1055xxx  or chondrocalcinosis. she
demonstrated the spectrum of clinical and radiological signs
typical of severe ochronotic arthropathy with involvement of
the spine, knees, hips, and shoulders and had under went
total joint replacement of both knees and the right hip. in a
series of 58 ochronotic patients, 8 (13.8%) had three or
more joints replaced.3 there are two other reports of four
total joint replacement arthroplasties in ochronosis,35,36 and
in one case seven joints had been replaced.25
to our knowledge, the case we present here is the first
report of low trauma distal femur fracture in an ochronotic
patient. while degenerative changes of the spine and major
joints have been frequently reported, there are only three
reports of spine fractures,5,7,8 one associated with cortisone
therapy,5 and only one report of femoral neck fracture.6
in ochronosis, the changes in the bone are thought to be less
severe than those in cartilage.37 the accumulation of
oxidized and polymerized products of homogentisic acid
reduces the cross-linkage of collagen fibers leading to
connective tissue failure, cartilage erosion, and progressive
degenerative changes.23 although ochronosis in bone
induces the same changes as in other connective tissues, the
severity appears to be limited by calcification and bone
remodelling.37 it is suggested that the detrimental effects of
ochronotic pigment on the fibrils of soft connective tissues
are avoided by the collagen fibrils of the bones because they
are encrusted by a mineral substance and because the newly
formed osteoid matrix remains uncalcified for too short of a
time to be modified by the pigment. in an ochronotic
femoral head, the pigment was not found in osteoblasts but
was present in the calcified matrix as well as in the
cytoplasmic vacuoles of osteoclasts and in osteocytes, some
of which were degenerate or dead.37 in a series of
ochronotic patients, the biochemical markers of bone
turnover showed increased bone resorption (high urinary
excretion of crosslinked n-telopeptides of type i collagen)
with an almost normal bone formation in 6 out of 7 patients
indicating accelerated bone loss.38 importantly, these
changes were associated with reduced femoral bone mineral
density. moreover, in organ cultures of embryonic chick
calvaria it was shown that homogentisic acid inhibits
intracellular hydroxylysine formation diminishing
intermolecular cross-links that are critically important for
the structural function of the newly synthesized collagen.39
it should be mentioned that in our patient, as in other
reported cases,38 while femoral neck bone mineral density
was markedly reduced, the lumbar spine bone mineral
density was normal or increased. this seeming paradox
might be due to extensive intervertebral disc calcification.
the case we present demonstrates that in ochronosis bony
structures may be severely affected. our patient had two
non-vertebral fractures (distal radium and distal femur)
within two years time, but did not have vitamin d deficiency
or secondary hyperparathyroidism. she has no other risk
factors for osteoporosis such as malnutrition, immobility,
smoking, medications (corticosteroids, anticonvulsants), or
alkaptonuric ochronosis

family history of osteoporotic fractures. moreover, she has
received alendronate therapy for the last two years with
improvement in bone mineral density. it now seems practical
that adequate antiresorptive therapy to prevent bone
fractures in ochronotic patients should be considered much
earlier in the course of treatment.
our patient has also had a severe aortic stenosis with
calcified valves and gross pigmentation of the aorta but no
coronary artery involvement. some case series have showed
no increase in frequency of calcification and stenosis of
aortic valves or coronary artery disease,40,41 but numerous
other observations suggest that ochronosis may be
associated with pigment deposition in aortic and mitral
valves, endocardium, pericardium, aortic intima, coronary
arteries and especially with valvular dystrophic calcification,
aortic stenosis, and coronary disease.42-49 in a series of 58
ochronotic patients, 3 (5.2%) had aortic valve replacement,
and 50% had computed tomographic evidence of coronary
artery calcification by 59 years of age.3
patients with alkaptonuria are known to be at increased risk
of nephrolithiasis. kidney stones caused by ochronosis were
reported in 16 out of 58 patients (27.6%), and more often in
males.3 an asymptomatic small calculus in the left kidney
was documented in our patient.
it is worth mentioning that clinical variability of
alkaptonuric ochronosis, which reflects the spectrum of
hgo mutations, may delay the diagnosis and lead to
mismanagement including unnecessary biopsies and surgery.
in one case ocular ochronotic pigmentation was
misdiagnosed as melanosarcoma and one eye was
mistakenly enucleated.50
although the diagnostic confirmation of alkaptonuria is
easily made by alkanization of urine with quantitative
determination of homogentisic acid in urine available, only
21% of patients are diagnosed before 1 year of age.3 in a
recently reported case,51 despite marked mucocutaneous
pigmentation, advanced spondyloarthropathy, unilateral hip
replacement, and blackened urine on standing, the diagnosis
was  xxxd3237xxx  until the patient was 82 years of age.
moreover, of 755 respondents to a “medical mystery”
published in the new england journal of medicine51 only
43% correctly diagnosed alkaptonuric ochronosis, while
23% thought of melanoma and 23% of porphyria or
porphyria cutanea tarda. paroxysmal nocturnal
haemoglobinuria and ingestion of arsenic or silver were
among other responses. pseudo-ochronosis, which is not an
inherited disorder, has been described as a result of argyria52
and long term use of levodopa, methyldopa,53 antimalarials,
or products containing hydroquinone, phenol, resorcinol,
mercury or picric acid.54
currently there is no specific and effective treatment for
alkaptonuria. although some advocate dietary protein
restriction (mainly phenylalanine and tyrosine), and ascorbic
acid to reduce urinary homogentisic acid excretion and
cm&r 2004 : 4 (november)

possibly reverse bone abnormalities,55 these observations
have not been confirmed in other studies.3,56
a direct pharmacologic reduction of homogentisic acid
production could be achieved with  xxxd2735xxx  therapy.
 xxxd2735xxx  is a triketone herbicide and potent inhibitor of
 xxxd40xxx  dioxygenase which is responsible
for catalyzing the formation of homogentisic acid from
 xxxd40xxx .  xxxd2735xxx  reduced urinary
homogentisic acid excretion by approximately 70% in two
patients with alkaptonuria. long-term side effects of
 xxxd2735xxx  therapy are under consideration.3
understanding the genetic and molecular basis of
alkaptonuria has the potential to offer a new therapeutic
approach, enzyme replacement therapy with recombinant
hgo. however, despite the theoretical advantage, such a
strategy may be difficult to employ. moreover, it is not
known whether accumulation of toxic metabolites of
tyrosine will occur, thus excluding this as an acceptable
alternative therapy. before human trials can be undertaken,
therapies would need to be carefully tested in animal
models.
in advanced cases, such as the one we present here, surgical
replacement of joints and aortic valves result in significant
improvement. usually the disorder does not affect life span.
physiotherapy, analgesia, and adequate anti-osteoporotic
therapy will be continued in our patient to prevent further
disability.
in conclusion, diagnosis and management of patients with
alkaptonuric ochronosis, a rare inherited disorder, is
complex. advances in orthopaedic and cardiac surgery have
enabled many patients to overcome progressive disability.
physicians and surgeons should be aware of multiple system
involvement in this disorder, as early recognition and
appropriate treatment may significantly improve the quality
of life in these patients.
