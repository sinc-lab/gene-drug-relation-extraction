abstract: pulmonary arterial hypertension (pah) is a life-threatening disease characterized
by an elevated pulmonary arterial pressure and vascular resistance with a poor prognosis.
various pulmonary and extrapulmonary causes are now recognized to exist separately from the
idiopathic form of pulmonary hypertension. an imbalance in the presence of vasoconstrictors
and vasodilators plays an important role in the pathophysiology of the disease, one example
being the lack of prostacyclin. prostacyclin and its analogues are potent vasodilators with
antithrombotic, antiproliferative and anti-inflammatory qualities, all of which are important
factors in the pathogenesis of precapillary pulmonary hypertension.  xxxd2331xxx  is a stable
prostacyclin analogue available for intravenous and aerosolized application. due to the severe
side effects of intravenous administration, the use of inhaled  xxxd2331xxx  has become a mainstay
in pah therapy. however, owing to the necessity for 6 to 9 inhalations a day, oral treatment
is often preferred as a first-line therapy. numerous studies proving the efficacy and safety of
inhaled  xxxd2331xxx  have been performed. it is therefore available for a first-line therapy for pah.
the combination with endothelin-receptor antagonists or sildenafil has shown encouraging
effects. further studies with larger patient populations will have to demonstrate the use of
combination therapy for long-term treatment of pulmonary hypertension.

pulmonary hypertension (ph) is an uncommon disease with a progressive course and
poor prognosis. it is characterized by an elevated pulmonary arterial pressure exceeding
25 mmhg at rest.1 the increase of pulmonary vascular resistance by different causes
induces a right heart overload finally leading to right heart failure and death.
vasoconstriction, in situ thrombosis in small arteries, and vascular remodeling by
proliferation of smooth muscle cells with intimal fibrosis, medial hypertrophy, and
adventitial thickening are major histopathological structural features of pulmonary
vasculopathy.2
underlying causes of ph have recently been summarized in the venice classification (see table 1).3 without treatment the median survival of patients with idiopathic
pulmonary hypertension (ipah) from the time of diagnosis is 2.8 years.4
this review highlights the role of prostacyclin in the pathophysiology of pulmonary
arterial hypertension (pah) and focuses on inhaled  xxxd2331xxx  as a treatment for the
various entities of ph. in addition, the role of  xxxd2331xxx  for the control of acute pah
during surgery will be discussed.

krug et al

for the purpose of this review, we will refer to the venice
classification only, as further variations discussed recently
have not yet been published officially. the term “primary
pulmonary hypertension” used in previous classifications
has been renamed and defined more precisely in the venice
classification of 20033 and includes ipah and familial pah
since that time.

pathophysiology
in healthy subjects a balance of dilators and constrictors of
the pulmonary vasculature results in a normal vascular tone
in pulmonary arteries. the vessel’s smooth muscle layer
maintains a state of predominant relaxation.
prostacyclin (pgi2) – a metabolite of  xxxd208xxx  – is
endogenously produced by pgi2 synthase and released from
pulmonary endothelial cells. it mediates vasodilatory
effects on pulmonary arteries and systemic circulation by
relaxation of smooth muscles and prevention of platelet
aggregation due to an increasing intracellular concentration
of cyclic adenosin monophosphate (camp).5 in contrast,
thromboxane6 – produced by thromboxane synthase from
 xxxd208xxx  in platelets – mediates vasoconstriction and
platelet aggregation.
in pah, vascular remodeling and vasoconstriction
are determined by an imbalance of the intracellularly
synthesized factors. 7 experiments in rats exposed to
monocrotaline and in hypoxic mice developing pah
have shown increased pgi 2 synthase expression in the
lung, partially antagonizing the rise in pulmonary arterial
pressure.8,9 a deficiency of pgi2 synthase in remodeled
pulmonary vasculature has been reported in patients suffering from severe pah.10 accordingly, exogenous pgi2
benefits patients with pah by antagonizing the effects of
vasoconstrictors such as thromboxane a2 and serotonine,

which are increased in endothelial cells11 causing platelet
activation and thrombosis.12 prostacyclin also possesses
positive inotropic effects resulting in an acutely increased
cardiac output.13 long-term improvements of cardiac output may in contrast be caused by anti-remodeling effects
of pgi2.14
since the decrease of endogenous pgi2 plays an important
role in the pathogenesis of pulmonary arterial hypertension,
the administration of exogenous pgi2 and derivatives has
become an area of intense investigation for more efficient
therapies for patients with pah.

prostacyclin and analogues
during the past two decades several pgi2 derivatives have
been synthesized and their effects on pulmonary arterial
hypertension have been studied. chronically intravenously
administered epoprostenol14 is characterized by a very short
half-life (6 min) but has a significant beneficial effect on
patients with ipah and scleroderma-associated pah. the
obligatory iv line, however, is prone to cause severe complications such as exit-site infections, deep venous thrombosis,
catheter displacement, and pneumothorax.15,16 therefore,
pgi2 analogues with different physical conditions and halflives delivered by alternative routes have been developed.
 xxxd2331xxx  is a more stable analogue of pgi2 with a longer
half-life approaching 30 minutes and similar effects on
hemodynamics compared to epoprostenol but still burdened
with complications of its way of delivery.17 subcutaneously
infused trepostinil with a half-life of 3 hours has led to
improved exercise capacity and improved hemodynamics
in patients with ipah and pah associated with collagen
vascular disease.18 however, side effects such as pain and
induration at the infusion-site, headache, nausea, rash, and
jaw pain are complications that are not rare. the first orally

active pgi2 analogue,  xxxd319xxx , had no significant effect on
hemodynamics in patients with pah in long-term studies19,20
but has been shown to prolong survival in pah patients, and
to improve exercise capacity.21 however, its use is limited
by prostanoid typical side effects and diarrhea.

inhaled  xxxd2331xxx 
for years, continuously administered pgi2 and analogues have
been used successfully to improve pulmonary hemodynamics
and long-term prognosis in pah patients. however, the
development of tolerance and serious side effects of this
treatment demonstrated the need for another route of
application.
an alternative way of administration of pgi2 has therefore
been developed with aerosolized  xxxd2331xxx  through inhalation.
this pgi2 analogue possesses similar vasodilative potency
and efficacy profile compared with epoprostenol leading to
the same intracellular effects after binding to the prostaglandin receptor.22  xxxd2331xxx  remains stable at room temperature
and in ambient light at ph 7.4 and offers a longer half-life
(20–25 min23) compared to aerosolized pgi2 or epoprostenol.
side effects, however, are very similar. the small aerosolized
particles (median diameter 0.5–3 µm) are deposited in the
lung parenchyma during tidal breathing.24,25 intra-acinar
pulmonary arteries closely surrounded by alveolar surfaces
are able to be dilated by alveolar pgi2 deposition. however,
6.5 to 9.4 minutes post inhalation the effect of inhaled
 xxxd2331xxx  is terminated by beta-oxidation resulting in an inactive
metabolite.26,27 it is therefore necessary to inhale  xxxd2331xxx  with
specialized nebulizers 6 to 12 times a day.28 for practical
purposes, the number of inhalations for long-term treatment
is usually recommended with 6 to 9 times per day. however,
powerful devices have made it possible to reduce the time
used for inhalation from 15 by jet ventilators to 4 minutes
by ultrasonic nebulizers.24 a common dosage regimen starts
with 2.5 µg per inhalation, and will be increased to 5 µg per
inhalation if tolerated well.
acting locally, inhaled  xxxd2331xxx  selectively dilates
pulmonary arteries. systemic side effects are thus greatly
reduced in comparison to intravenously or subcutaneously
administered drugs.29 given the role of the  xxxg1879xxx 
in the pathophysiology of pah and the in vivo effects of
pgi2 and its derivates inhaled  xxxd2331xxx  has become a potent
therapeutic option to treat patients with precapillary ph.

inhaled  xxxd2331xxx  for pah (group i)
the first study demonstrating a favorable effect of inhaled
 xxxd2331xxx  in patients with pah was published as early as

vascular health and risk management 2009:5

inhaled  xxxd2331xxx  for pulmonary hypertension

1996 by olschewski et al.22 this group had demonstrated
a vasodilative effect of inhaled pgi 2 in patients with
ards before.30 in addition, hemodynamic effects have
also been reported in dogs with hypoxia-induced ph.31
in 6 patients with idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension and ph associated with crest syndrome 100 µg
of pgi2 (and  xxxd2331xxx  in one patient) were aerosolized in
6 to 9 doses for 15 minutes each. acute and long-term
beneficial effects on hemodynamics were demonstrated.
in 1999, 8 patients with ph accompanying lung fibrosis
exhibited significant benefit to aerosolized pgi2 suggesting
a vasoconstrictive component in the pathophysiology of
this clinical situation.32 in both studies effects of the inhaled
pgi2 analogon  xxxd2331xxx  lasted longer than effects after the
aerosolized pgi2.
short-term effects on exercise capacity and were studied
by wensel et al in 2000.33 exercise duration and ventilation
(peak oxygen uptake, ve versus vco2 slope) improved
significantly after the inhalation of  xxxd2331xxx  in 11 patients
with ipah and pah due to morbus osler. in this study the
strongest independent predictors of survival turned out to be
vo2max and peak systolic blood pressure during exercise,
highlighting the importance of performing cardiopulmonary
exercise testing for future study assessment.
hoeper et al compared acute effects of inhaled  xxxd2331xxx 
and  xxxd2738xxx .34 the pgi2 analogue  xxxd2331xxx  resulted in a
greater decrease in pulmonary artery pressure and a stronger
increase in cardiac output. vasodilatory effects of inhaled
pgi2 lasted for approximately 60 minutes. however, a maximum of 9 inhalations of  xxxd2331xxx  per day were performed.
long-term beneficial effects on pulmonary artery pressure
and exercise capacity had nevertheless been shown before.
the authors therefore concluded that an inhibitory effect of
pgi2 on vasoproliferation existed. they also suggested that
the number of daily inhalations could be reduced due to this
additional lasting effect.
this persisting effect of inhaled  xxxd2331xxx  in long-term treatment was also published by two groups in 2000. olschewski
et al examined 19 patients with ph in an open, uncontrolled,
multicenter study. after inhaling  xxxd2331xxx  for 3 months
hemodynamic parameters and exercise capacity improved,
whereas the acute response to  xxxd2331xxx  did not change (results
pre- versus post-inhalation were similar at 3 months).35 in a
prospective study hoeper et al36 investigated the effect of
 xxxd2331xxx  on exercise capacity and hemodynamics in 24 patients
with ipah of nyha classes iii and iv. patients received
6 to 8 inhalations of 100 µg of  xxxd2331xxx  per day. six-minute
walking distance (6mwd) increased significantly after

3 months of treatment. this effect was still maintained at
12 months. improvements of hemodynamic parameters were
also observed. it was suggested, that aerosolized  xxxd2331xxx  be
used for long-term therapy treatment of ph.
these encouraging findings in patients with precapillary
ph stimulated the launch of a controlled study investigating
the safety and efficacy of  xxxd2331xxx . the study was termed
air for aerosolized  xxxd2331xxx  randomized study. it had been
designed as a european, randomized, multicenter, placebocontrolled trial and was finally published by olschewski et al.37
two hundred and three patients with ipah, inoperable
chronic thromboembolic pah and ph associated with
collagen vascular diseases or appetite suppressants in nyha
functional classes iii and iv were included. the effects of
6 to 9 inhalations of 5 µg  xxxd2331xxx  per day over a period of
12 weeks were evaluated regarding a combined end point of
exercise capacity (increase of 10%) and functional class.
16.8% of the patients in the verum group versus 4.9% of
the placebo group achieved the combined endpoint of an
increased 6mwd and nyha class improvement without
clinical deterioration (p = 0.007). of the  xxxd2331xxx  group
23.8% improved by one nyha class and 37.6% walked
at least 10% further than at baseline. in contrast, 12.7% of
the patients receiving placebo exhibited an improvement in
nyha classification, and the 6mwd increased in 25.5% by
at least 10%. the increase of the 6mwd between the two
groups did not reach statistical significance, but the improvement in functional class was significantly more frequent
in the  xxxd2331xxx  group (p = 0.03). the 6mwd increased by
36.5 m at 12 weeks in all patients inhaling  xxxd2331xxx , and the
increase was even greater in the subgroup of ipah patients,
at 58.8 m. hemodynamic parameters following 12 weeks of
inhalation of  xxxd2331xxx  significantly improved in comparison
with baseline values (p  0.001).
common adverse effects were described as cough,
headache, flushing and jaw pain. in this study serious side
effects such as syncope, tachycardia, pneumonia and dyspnea
occurred in 2% to 5% of the patients. although in this study
the impact of inhaled  xxxd2331xxx  was not compared with the
effects of alternative pgi2 analogues, efficacy and safety of
this form of application of  xxxd2331xxx  were demonstrated.
opitz et al studied the effects of inhaled  xxxd2331xxx  with
regards to the long-term tolerability and clinical efficacy in
76 patients still symptomatic with conventional treatment
(ipah, nyha classes ii and iii).38 at 12 months, 32 patients
still remained on monotherapy with  xxxd2331xxx . the rate of
event-free survival 3 months after starting therapy was 81%,
53% after 1 year and 13% at 5 years. overall survival rates

showed moderate results, with 93% after 3 months, 79% at
1 year and 49% at 5 years.
acute hemodynamic effects of inhaled  xxxd2331xxx  were
also analyzed by an in vivo investigation by fruhwald et al.
these authors implanted a hemodynamic monitoring device
into 5 patients with pah.39 its sensor was placed in the right
ventricular outflow tract. right ventricular pressures were
recorded. as a result a significant decrease in pulmonary arterial
pressure was seen following inhalation of  xxxd2331xxx . however,
this effect lasted only 17 to 48 minutes. thus, the duration of
vasodilation caused by inhaled  xxxd2331xxx  is significantly shorter
than previously suggested. nevertheless, rebound ph with
hypoxemic periods at night during the interval without inhalation
were not found by mereles et al.40 as a cause, the authors mentioned a different reaction to a lower heart rate and cardiac output
at night due to a pre-dominant parasympathic tone. for patients
who experience nightly rebounds, domenighetti suggested a
combination therapy with the vasodilating phosphodiesterase
inhibitor sildenafil to cover the inhalation break.41
a comparison of the impact of aerosolized versus intravenous
 xxxd2331xxx  was done by opitz et al42 in patients with severe pah.
similar hemodynamic changes were observed for both routes of
application. in contrast, pulmonary vasoselectivity was greater
using inhaled  xxxd2331xxx  which is generally recognized to be of
benefit. few studies however, did not confirm the advantage
of aerosolized  xxxd2331xxx  over the intravenous application. in one
study switch from epoprostenol to inhaled  xxxd2331xxx  in 3 patients
was unsuccessful due to development of right heart failure.43
another study reported improvement of exercise capacity with
intravenous  xxxd2331xxx  in 16 patients who deteriorated under
therapy with inhaled  xxxd2331xxx .44
precapillary ph of classification group i other than ipah
has rarely been treated with inhaled pgi2 analogues. launay
et al published a study in 5 patients with ph associated to
crest syndrome in 2001, demonstrating improvements in
nyha functional class and exercise capacity.45 the 6mwd
increased from 352 ± 48 to 437 ± 56 m (p = 0.06) at 6 months.
along these lines hallioglu et al46 also observed an advantage
of aerosolized  xxxd2331xxx  over intravenous infusion in children
with ph secondary to congenital heart disease. in this study the
decrease in pulmonary-to-systemic vascular resistance ratio
was found to be significantly greater with inhaled  xxxd2331xxx .

inhaled  xxxd2331xxx  for pulmonary hypertension

of all patients diagnosed with acute pulmonary embolism.
there have been only scarce reports using aerosolized
 xxxd2331xxx  for the treatment of cteph patients. in the
air study37 a subgroup receiving  xxxd2331xxx  comprised 33
patients with cteph representing 67% of the patients in
the “nonprimary pulmonary hypertension” group.  xxxd2331xxx 
inhalation in this group resulted in beneficial effects
on exercise capacity and improvement of nyha class.
however, in this study separate data for cteph patients
were not mentioned. kramm et al reported successful
treatment of residual postoperative ph after pulmonary
thrombendarterectomy. 49 in addition to these studies,
several case reports on inhaled  xxxd2331xxx  in cteph have
been published.50,51
ulrich et al showed similar pulmonary artery compliance
in 35 patients with ipah and 22 with cteph performing
acute vasoreactivity testing with inhalative  xxxd2738xxx  and
 xxxd2331xxx .52 the existence of a reversible vasoconstrictive
component in cteph was also suggested in a study
observing significant acute hemodynamic improvement after
inhalation of  xxxd2331xxx .53
for patients with pah classified other than groups i
and iv (venice classification) only a few cases have been
published. a patient with systemic sclerosis and lung fibrosis

suffering from severe pah who had contraindications for
 xxxd358xxx  treatment received inhaled  xxxd2331xxx . exercise
capacity and hemodynamics improved 54 shortly after
treatment had been started.
long-term experiences with novel treatments for
portopulmonary hypertension have been rare so far. hoeper
et al recently observed improved survival rates and greater
improvements in hemodynamics as well as exercise capacity in
patients with portopulmonary hypertension on  xxxd358xxx  therapy
compared to patients with portopulmonary hypertension on
inhaled  xxxd2331xxx .55

combination therapies
owing to the repeated and still somewhat tedious application
of inhaled  xxxd2331xxx , orally available pharmaceuticals have
recently been preferred as initial therapy of ph. none of the
new drugs approved for ph appears to be able to completely
prevent progress in all cases. for this reason the combination
of compounds acting via different pathways has been
investigated by several authors. inhaled  xxxd2331xxx  has been
combined with either an endothelin-receptor antagonist or
with a phosphodiesterase (pde) inhibitor – both specific
pulmonary vasodilators.  xxxd2331xxx  has also been used in
combination with dual oral therapy.

krug et al

in 2001 schermuly et al described an additive vasodilative
effect of pgi2 simultaneously applied with pde inhibitors
while maintaining lung selectivity in rabbits.56 wilkens
et al proposed prolonged and increased vasodilation
following inhaled  xxxd2331xxx  when the pde-5 inhibitor
sildenafil was added in 5 patients with ipah. combining
the two therapeutic strategies resulted in a significantly
lower mean pulmonary artery pressure compared to that
reached by application of each of the single compounds.57
in a group of 73 patients with ph, 14 deteriorated while
on  xxxd2331xxx  applied by inhalation. adding sildenafil to
the existing  xxxd2331xxx  therapy improved exercise capacity
from 256 ± 30 m to 349 ± 32 m (p = 0.002) at 12 months.
pulmonary vascular resistance decreased from 2494 ± 256
to 1950 ± 128 dyn*s/cm5 as early as 3 months after installation of combination therapy.58
improvements in exercise capacity (6mwd increased
by 58 ± 43 m) and maximal oxygen consumption (from
11 ± 2.3 to 13.8 ± 3.6 ml × min−1 × kg−1) were also reported
in a series of 20 patients (9 patients on aerosolized  xxxd2331xxx ,
11 patients on oral  xxxd319xxx ) after 3 months of treatment by
hoeper et al 200359 adding the endothelin-receptor antagonist
 xxxd358xxx .
seyfarth et al60 observed an increase in exercise capacity
and a decline of the tei index, indicating improvements in
right heart function 6 months after adding inhaled  xxxd2331xxx  to
existing  xxxd358xxx  therapy in 10 patients with ipah, cteph
and pah associated with interstitial lung disease. nine
patients also improved in nyha functional class.
the step trial included 67 pah patients of functional
class nyha iii, receiving either inhaled  xxxd2331xxx  or placebo
in addition to  xxxd358xxx  therapy for a minimum of 4 months.61
an increase in the postinhalation, 6mwd of 30 m (p = 0.001)
was reported in the verum group and of 4 m (p = 0.69) in
the placebo goup compared to baseline values. however, the
group-adjusted difference of 26 m was achieved with only
a marginal significance of p = 0.051. 34% of the patients in
the  xxxd2331xxx  group improved in functional class versus 6%
on placebo (p = 0.002). a significant prolongation of the
time to clinical worsening was demonstrated using combined instead of mono therapy. in this study the authors
suggested, that inhaled  xxxd2331xxx  is an option for expanding
monotherapy when necessary, whereas hoeper et al62 presented a multi-center study (combi trial) in 2006, in which
adding inhaled  xxxd2331xxx  to  xxxd358xxx  failed to show positive
effects on hemodynamics in 40 ipah patients. the authors
discussed the smaller sample size and higher disease severity
in the combi trial as reasons for the difference in outcome

of these two similarly designed studies. however, the median
changes in the 6mwd revealed a significant advantage for
the  xxxd2331xxx  group (+25 m) in comparison to the placebo
group (+5 m).
unfortunately, all studies investigating the effect of
a combination therapy have been performed with small
populations and relatively great heterogeneity in terms of
forms of ph.
inhaled  xxxd2331xxx  is currently approved for ipah functional
class iii in europe by the european medicine agency
(emea), whereas it may be used for patients with pah in
functional classes iii and iv in countries under the law of
the food and drug administration (fda) and for pah as
well as cteph (nyha iii, iv) in australia.

anesthesiologic management
of patients with pulmonary
hypertension and the role of inhaled
 xxxd2331xxx 
ph represents a major risk factor for an increased perioperative
mortality regardless of which anesthetic technique is used:
stress, pain, mechanical ventilation and systemic inflammation may lead to a further increase of pulmonary pressure with
the consequence of acute right heart insufficiency and failure.
ramakrishna and coworkers identified several independent
predictors for short-term morbidity and mortality: a history of
pulmonary embolism, nyha functional class  ii, high-risk
surgery, and duration of anesthesia 3 hours.63 in his patient
cohort 42% developed one or more short-term morbid events.
in this study, the intraoperative use of vasopressors and the
non-use of  xxxd2738xxx  were associated with an increased postoperative mortality. depending on the underlying disease and
the kind of surgical intervention, mortality ranges between 7%
and 24%, especially in cases of emergency interventions.64–66
the perioperative management of patients with severe
ph should start preoperatively with a multidisciplinary
approach to optimize the clinical conditions (anesthesiologist, cardiologist, pulmologist, and surgeon). preoperative
evaluation includes echocardiography with special attention
to the level of right ventricular dysfunction. in selected cases,
right heart catheterization should be done preoperatively
to test for responsiveness of the pulmonary vasculature to
intravenous or inhaled vasodilators. all options to treat ph
(oxygen, endothelin-antagonists, pde-inhibitors, intravenous
or inhaled prostanoids) should be exploited prior to surgery.
if ph is newly diagnosed, fox and coworkers recommend
preoperative therapy with oral sildenafil (50–100 mg).67

preoperative sedation (midazolam) should be reduced
to a minimum or substituted by psychological care to avoid
respiratory insufficiency and acidosis.
both general and regional anesthesia may be used in
patients with severe ph, none of them has been proven
superior to the other, but both are risky. in principle, 100%
oxygen should be used, and acidosis, hypothermia, and
hypercarbia should strictly be avoided due to their pulmonary
vasoconstrictive effects.
epidural anesthesia has been used safely in patients with
ph for non-cardiac surgery, vaginal delivery, and cesarean
section.68 owing to the better hemodynamic stability, spinal
catheter technique should be preferred over spinal single
shoot anesthesia.

intraoperative monitoring and treatment
of pulmonary hypertension
an intra-arterial line for beat-to-beat measurement of arterial
blood pressure is essential to ensure sufficient myocardial
perfusion pressure and for frequent blood gas analysis.
a pulmonary artery catheter is essential for the continuous
monitoring of mean pulmonary arterial pressure and, if
necessary, for measurement of pulmonary capillary wedge
pressure. using specialized pulmonary arterial catheters,
continuous monitoring of right ventricular ejection fraction
is possible (vigilance;® edwards lifesciences). a central
venous catheter is helpful for monitoring of right ventricular
preload and necessary for central administration of vasoactive
drugs. whenever possible, transesophageal echocardiography
is an excellent method for visualization of right ventricular
filling and function.
the challenge for the anesthesiologist is to prevent
patients from intraoperative ph crisis by optimization of
oxygenation, analgesia, intravascular volume, ventilation,
and acid-base status. nevertheless, an increase of pulmonary
pressure may occur and should be treated immediately to
avoid right heart insufficiency and failure.
in all cases with systemic normo- or hypertension,
intravenous administration of vasodilators is effective to
reduce both systemic and pulmonary vascular resistance:
milrinone or pgi2 are established intravenous therapies for
an effective treatment of ph. right ventricular preload may
be reduced by continuous infusion of nitroglycerin or sodium
nitroprusside.67,69,70 however, intravenous vasodilators should
be used very carefully to avoid a drop of the mean arterial
pressure. in case of hypotension, intravenous vasodilators
may cause worsening of right ventricular perfusion and
consecutive right ventricular failure.

vascular health and risk management 2009:5

inhaled  xxxd2331xxx  for pulmonary hypertension

in ph patients with intraoperative systemic hypotension,
inhalation of vasodilators is an advantageous alternative to
reduce pulmonary pressure without negative effects on mean
arterial pressure and myocardial perfusion. lung-selective
vasodilation is possible using  xxxd2738xxx , milrinone, pgi2, or
 xxxd2331xxx  (table 3).69–73 inhaled  xxxd2331xxx , however, is superior
to the others in this list, because of its longer half-life, its lack
of severe side effects and its ease of administration. kurzyna
et al74 for instance, describe the use of inhaled  xxxd2331xxx  as a
rescue therapy in 4 patients with deteriorating hypoxemia
after atrial septostomy probably caused by an oversized
right-to-left shunt. in desperate cases, a combination therapy
may augment the vasodilatory effects.75

postoperative care
for all patients with significant ph postoperative intensive
care monitoring is obligatory for at least 12 hours. attention
should focus on adequate oxygenation and ventilation, monitoring of right heart function and mean pulmonary arterial
pressure, avoidance of acidosis, and adequate treatment of
pain.

conclusion
years of investigation have led to the acceptance of inhaled
 xxxd2331xxx  as a major strategy to be used in precapillary ph.
the majority of the studies have demonstrated significant
beneficial effects of inhaled  xxxd2331xxx  on hemodynamics,
exercise capacity and survival. recently, potent orally

available drugs have been developed that work well as
first-line pah therapeutics. due to its more complex
application involving 6 to 9 inhalations a day inhaled  xxxd2331xxx 
is no longer the first choice in pah therapy. however, it is
clearly a very valuable option if oral treatment is impossible or
for combination therapy if monotherapy does not suffice.
aerosolized  xxxd2331xxx  clearly has an advantage over
intravenously or subcutaneously administered pgi2 analogues
with only limited side effects due to targeted delivery
resulting in a selective pulmonary effect. aerosolized  xxxd2331xxx 
may therefore be given to patients with acute hemodynamic
instability. improvements in the application mode may be
hoped for such as the development of longer stable pgi2
analogues and more potent and faster delivery units.
the wide use of aerosolized  xxxd2331xxx  is also reflected in
its use for vasoreactivity testing in patients with ph. in that
respect,  xxxd2331xxx  proved to be even more potent than no.76
the combination with other vasodilators has resulted in
encouraging effects on hemodynamics and tolerance. further
studies with higher numbers of patients will demonstrate if
combined strategies including inhaled  xxxd2331xxx  are in fact
appropriate for long-term pah treatment.
beside the key study (air) to prove inhaled  xxxd2331xxx  as
a potent therapeutic for patients with precapillary ph with
limited functional capacity (nyha iii, iv), all other studies
were non-controlled, but suggested effectiveness, tolerability,
and longer survival.
patients with functional classes nyha ii and iii exhibited
more benefit on monotherapy with  xxxd2331xxx  than classes iv
and therefore these patients appear to be especially suited for
inhaled  xxxd2331xxx . further evaluation might focus on early combined treatment involving inhaled  xxxd2331xxx  and oral treatment
in nyha class ii patients but will also have to evaluate all
combinations used for pulmonary arterial hypertension.
