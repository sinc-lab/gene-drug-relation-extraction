role of  xxxg1924xxx  in cancer:
therapeutic potential of targeting the
raf/mek/erk signal transduction pathway
jared a. gollob,a scott wilhelm,b chris carter,b and susan l. kelleyb
improvements in our understanding of the molecular basis of cancer have led to the clinical
development of protein kinase inhibitors, which target pivotal molecules involved in intracellular signaling pathways implicated in tumorigenesis and progression. these novel
targeted agents have demonstrated activity against a wide range of solid tumors, are
generally better tolerated than standard chemotherapeutics, and may revolutionize the
management of advanced refractory cancer. the ubiquitous raf serine/threonine kinases
are pivotal molecules within the raf/mitogen extracellular kinase (mek)/extracellular
signal-related kinase (erk) signaling pathway, which regulates cellular proliferation and
survival.  xxxg1924xxx  isoforms (wild-type  xxxg1924xxx  or the b-raf v600e oncogene) are overactivated in a variety of solid tumor types, including renal cell carcinoma (rcc), hepatocellular
carcinoma (hcc), non-small cell lung cancer (nsclc), melanoma, and papillary thyroid
carcinoma. in this review, the role of raf in normal cells and in cancer is discussed, and an
overview is given of raf inhibitors currently in development, focusing on sorafenib tosylate
( xxxd3226xxx  or sorafenib). sorafenib is the first oral multi-kinase inhibitor to be developed
that targets raf kinases ( xxxg1924xxx , wild-type b-raf, and b-raf v600e), in addition to receptor
tyrosine kinases associated with angiogenesis ( xxxg2413xxx  receptor
[vegfr]-2/-3, platelet-derived growth factor receptor [pdgfr]-␤) or tumor progression
( xxxg801xxx , c-kit). preclinical and clinical sorafenib data that led to its recent approval for the
treatment of advanced rcc are summarized, along with current thinking on sorafenib’s
mechanism of effect on the tumor and tumor vasculature in melanoma and rcc.

breast cancer patients, with only 7% to 8% surviving for 15
years.4 renal cell carcinoma (rcc), the predominant form of
kidney cancer, is difficult to detect early and 30% of patients
present with metastatic disease at diagnosis.5 this well-vascularized tumor type is one of the most chemoresistant solid tumors,
and existing cytokines for patients with metastatic disease, including interleukin-2 and interferon-alpha, are associated with
low objective response rates (ⱕ20%) and poor 5-year survival
(⬃10%).6,7 other advanced solid tumors, such as hepatocellular
carcinoma (hcc) and pancreatic carcinoma, are associated with
even lower 5-year survival rates.8 there is, therefore, an urgent
need for improved and innovative anticancer treatments to increase survival or delay progression in patients with advanced
solid tumors.
in recent decades, improvements in the understanding of the
molecular basis of cancer have led to the development of targeted agents tailored to inhibit specific protein kinases involved
in intracellular signal transduction pathways that drive tumorigenesis and progression, such as the mitogen-activated protein

targeting  xxxg1924xxx  in cancer
kinase (mapk) or raf/mitogen extracellular kinase (mek)/extracellular signal-related kinase (erk) pathway, and the phosphotidylinositol (pi)3-kinase/akt/ xxxg1478xxx  (mtor) pathway.9-11 these targeted agents have shown
promising anti-tumor activity in patients with advanced cancer,
and are generally better tolerated than standard cytotoxic chemotherapeutic agents.9,12 it is likely that resistance may develop
towards narrowly targeted agents, because of the inherent mutability of solid tumors and the redundancy and extensive crosstalk that exists between the signaling pathways that drive tumor
cell proliferation and survival. current thinking, therefore, favors the design of anticancer agents that target a broader array of
relevant targets as the next step in improving clinical benefit
from these agents. this aim could also be achieved by use of
combinations of agents with different targets. as clinical experience with targeted agents increases, the oncology community
will better understand how to use these novel drugs as single
agents or in rationally designed combination treatments to
achieve maximum therapeutic benefit in the advanced cancer
setting.
the raf/mek/erk signal transduction pathway is present in
all eukaryotic cells.13 this pivotal pathway relays extracellular
signals to the nucleus via a cascade of specific phosphorylation
events involving ras, raf, mek, and erk to regulate fundamental cellular processes, including proliferation, differentiation,
and cell survival.13 this key pathway is upregulated in approximately 30% of human cancers, and raf serine/threonine
kinases, in particular, have been identified as targets for anticancer drug design.14
sorafenib tosylate (sorafenib; nexavar, onyx pharmaceuticals;  xxxd3226xxx ) is the first multi-kinase inhibitor to be
developed that targets  xxxg1924xxx .15 this oral multi-kinase inhibitor has dual effects on the tumor (inhibition of proliferation)
and the tumor vasculature (inhibition of angiogenesis) by blocking raf, as well as various receptor tyrosine kinases (rtks).15
sorafenib inhibits  xxxg1924xxx , wild-type b-raf, and b-raf v599e (now
known as v600e) serine/threonine kinases in vitro. it also
inhibits rtks, including the proangiogenic vascular endothelial
growth factor receptors -2 ( xxxg1274xxx ) and -3 ( xxxg802xxx ), and
platelet-derived growth factor receptor-␤ (pdgfr-␤) in vitro.
sorafenib also inhibits rtks involved in tumor growth, including stem cell growth factor (c-kit) and fms-like tyrosine
kinase-3 ( xxxg801xxx ).15 sorafenib has direct antiproliferative (raf/
mek/erk pathway inhibition)15 and proapoptotic ( xxxg1388xxx 
downregulation)16,17 effects on a range of tumor cells, and has
shown antiangiogenic effects on tumor endothelial cells.15,18
this review will focus on the raf  xxxg1377xxx  isoforms as pivotal members of the best characterized intracellular
signal transduction pathway. we will discuss the effects of raf
on cellular proliferation and survival, and present an overview of
evidence that dysregulated signaling through raf is involved in
human tumorigenesis, angiogenesis, metastasis, and tumor
resistance to treatment. raf inhibitors currently in development
will then be summarized with particular emphasis on sorafenib
preclinical and clinical findings in rcc and current thinking on
how sorafenib may be acting in rcc.

 xxxg1924xxx  isoforms:
gatekeepers to the raf/
mek/erk signaling pathway
the ubiquitous raf/mek/erk pathway is activated by
the binding of growth factors, such as transforming growth factor-alpha (tgf-␣),  xxxg681xxx  (egf), vegf, and
pdgf-␤ to their cognate receptors (eg, egfr,  xxxg1274xxx /-3, and
pdgfr-␤).19-23 this results in autophosphorylation by rtks
and activation of a kinase cascade that relays growth factor signals from the cell surface to the nucleus.19-23 as pivotal members
of the raf/mek/erk signaling pathway, the  xxxg1924xxx  isoforms
 xxxg184xxx , b-raf, and  xxxg1924xxx  (c-raf or c- xxxg1924xxx ) are involved in the
regulation of cellular proliferation, differentiation, survival, angiogenesis, adhesion, and migration.19-23 this family of cytosolic
serine/threonine protein kinases is generally considered to form
part of a linear kinase cascade, with ras as an upstream activator,
and mek as a unique downstream substrate (fig 1).13 rather
than directly activating  xxxg184xxx  and  xxxg1924xxx , activated ras binds and
recruits them to the cell membrane to facilitate their activation in
a multi-step process involving dephosphorylations and phosphorylations (fig 1).13,24-26 in contrast, b-raf has a single tyrosine-to-aspartate amino acid difference that renders it effectively “preactivated” when recruited to the plasma membrane by
ras.25 once activated, raf isoforms will phosphorylate mek.13
of the raf isoforms, b-raf is the most potent, and  xxxg184xxx  is the
weakest activator of mek.27 activated mek then phosphorylates and activates erk.13 erk then regulates cell function by
acting on more than 50 substrates in the cytosol and the
nucleus.13 these substrates include indirect inducers of gene
expression (eg, p90-ribosomal s6 kinase [p90-rsk], which
modifies transcription factors and histones),28 transcription factors (eg, hypoxia-inducible factor [hif]; ets-like transcription
factor-1 [elk-1]),23 and cell cycle–related kinases (eg, arf,
mdm2, p27kip).29,30 importantly, the biological outcomes of signaling through raf/mek/erk, such as increased cellular proliferation and prolonged cellular survival, could also contribute to
tumorigenesis and progression if signaling through this pathway
is dysregulated.
it has recently become apparent that, in addition to exerting
effects via mek and erk,  xxxg1924xxx  has direct or mek/erk-independent effects on cell function (fig 1).31 aberrant upregulation
of these direct  xxxg1924xxx  pathways, particularly those leading to cellular proliferation and increased cell survival, could also contribute to tumorigenesis and progression.31

direct (mek/erk-independent)
effects of  xxxg1924xxx  on cell survival
the observation that the embryonic fibroblasts of  xxxg1924xxx  knockout (k/o) mice retain normal proliferative capacity and erk activation status, but have high levels of programmed cell death
(apoptosis), strongly suggests that  xxxg1924xxx  promotes cell survival
by a mek/erk-independent effect.13,32,33 recent studies have
confirmed that  xxxg1924xxx  can prolong cell survival by directly inhibiting programmed cell death (apoptosis) by several mechanisms
that require its translocation to the mitochondrial compartment.

figure 1 raf is a pivotal downstream mediator of growth factor signaling, and exerts its effects either by mek/erk
activation or independently of mek/erk (ie, direct effects). the binding of growth factors, such as tgf-␣, egf, vegf,
and pdgf-␤, to their cognate receptors (egfr,  xxxg1274xxx /-3, and pdgfr-␤) on the cell surface activates the ubiquitous
raf/mek/erk signaling pathway to regulate proliferation, differentiation, survival, angiogenesis, adhesion, and mobility. abbreviations: transforming growth factor-␣ (tgf-␣),  xxxg681xxx  (egf), vascular endothelial

cell survival pathways and the mechanism of  xxxg1924xxx  mitochondrial translocation are poorly understood, it is clear that dysregulated activity of these pathways could be important in both
tumorigenesis and chemoresistance.
activation of the intrinsic apoptotic pathway disrupts the mitochondrial membrane potential, leading to the release into the
cytosol of  xxxg569xxx  and other factors that trigger apoptosome formation, and subsequent activation of the terminal
caspase cascade, which results in cell death.34-36 mitochondrial
release of  xxxg569xxx  is regulated by proapoptotic (eg, apoptosis signal-regulated kinase [ask-1], bcl-2 antagonist of cell
death [bad]) and anti-apoptotic proteins (eg, bcl-2,  xxxg1388xxx ).36-40
phosphorylation of  xxxg1924xxx  by pak-1 or the bcr-abl oncoprotein
induces the translocation of  xxxg1924xxx  to the outer mitochondrial
membrane.39,41 here,  xxxg1924xxx  phosphorylates and inactivates
bad, and activates bcl-2 to prevent  xxxg569xxx  release and
prolong cell survival.39,41 interestingly, this direct anti-apoptotic
effect of  xxxg1924xxx  is independent of mek/erk.39
 xxxg1924xxx  also directly inhibits the degradation of the anti-apoptotic protein  xxxg1388xxx  to prolong cell survival in cholangiocarcinoma cells,40 and can directly bind to and inhibit the proapop-

totic protein ask-1 by a mek/erk-independent mechanism.37
this  xxxg1924xxx  inhibitory effect does not appear to involve kinase
activity.37
furthermore,  xxxg1924xxx  has recently been shown to inhibit
the novel proapoptotic protein, mammalian sterile 20-like
kinase 2 (mst2), by a direct protein–protein interaction
that does not require its kinase activity.42,43 depletion of
 xxxg1924xxx  in human cancer cell lines by small interfering
(si)rna resulted in mst2 activation and increased sensitivity to apoptosis in a recent study.43 in contrast to  xxxg1924xxx ,
b-raf was unable to bind to and inhibit mst2 in the human cancer cell lines evaluated.43

raf isoforms and tumorigenesis
oncogenic  xxxg1924xxx  mutations and
malignant transformation in vitro
activated oncogenic forms of  xxxg1924xxx  (eg, v-raf), mutant raf proteins, and  xxxg1924xxx  fusion proteins all induce transformation of cell
lines in vitro.  xxxg1924xxx  has been shown to mediate transformation

targeting  xxxg1924xxx  in cancer
via the mek/erk mitogenic pathway, and also by a mek/erkindependent route.44 despite the ease with which oncogenic
 xxxg1924xxx  mutants transform cells in vitro, tumor-specific oncogenic
 xxxg1924xxx  mutations have been observed only rarely in human
tumor-derived cell lines.45,46 genetic rearrangements at the
 xxxg1924xxx  locus, resulting in mutant  xxxg1924xxx  oncogenes, have often
been reported in transfection studies designed to determine the
transforming genes present within tumor dna. however, no
such  xxxg1924xxx  mutations or translocations were identified in the
corresponding primary tumor tissue, suggesting that the
observed mutations represented transfection artefacts.45,46

 xxxg1924xxx  overactivation in solid tumors in vivo
due to its pivotal regulatory position in the raf/mek/erk pathway, its novel direct role in promoting cell survival, and its
ability to induce malignant transformation in vitro, it
is unsurprising that  xxxg1924xxx  has been implicated in the onset and
progression (angiogenesis, invasiveness, and metastatic spread)
of solid tumors in vivo. although oncogenic  xxxg1924xxx  mutations
may be rare in human malignancies, the dysregulated upregulation of wild-type  xxxg1924xxx  activity is a common feature of solid
tumors and can arise by several mechanisms.
tumors with  xxxg1924xxx 
overactivation due to oncogenic ras
activating oncogenic mutations within the upstream ras gene
implicated in tumorigenesis can result in constitutive activation
of downstream  xxxg1924xxx .47 the ras proto-oncogene family, which
includes  xxxg1605xxx  (neuroblastoma cell line), h-ras (harvey
murine sarcoma virus), and  xxxg1285xxx  (kirsten murine sarcoma virus), has a pivotal role in both normal cellular function and
cancer.47,48 oncogenic ras mutations or overexpression of wildtype ras induce dna synthesis resulting in malignant transformation,49 loss of growth factor dependence and contact inhibition,50,51 inhibition of terminal differentiation,52 increased cell
survival,53 and invasion/metastasis,54 which are all pathognomonic features of the cancerous cell. oncogenic point mutations
within the ras gene (particularly within  xxxg1285xxx ) at codons 12, 13,
or 61 are some of the most frequently detected genetic abnormalities in human cancer.47,48 oncogenic ras mutations
occur in pancreatic (90%), thyroid (50%), and colorectal
(50%) carcinomas, nsclc (35%), hcc (30%), acute
myeloid leukemia (aml, 30%), melanoma (15%), and kidney tumors (10%).47,48
oncogenic  xxxg1285xxx  mutations occur early in the development of
pancreatic carcinomas, and downregulation of  xxxg1285xxx  in pancreatic tumor cells (panc-1 and mia-paca2) by rna interference
(rnai) reduces their malignant potential.55 use of rnai to
reduce  xxxg1285xxx  also greatly increases the radiosensitivity of pancreatic carcinoma cells. the presence of  xxxg1285xxx  may also be associated with poor prognosis in pancreatic carcinoma patients.56
oncogenic  xxxg1285xxx  mutations have also been associated with the
pathogenesis of colon cancer, have been shown to be necessary
for maintaining the transformed and invasive phenotype of
colon tumor cells in vitro,57 and are predictive of a poor prognosis.58,59 similarly,  xxxg1285xxx -2 mutations may predict poor prognosis (reduced survival) in nsclc.60 oncogenic  xxxg1285xxx  has also
been implicated in the  xxxg1885xxx –related protein-

395
induced hypercalcemia that is associated with an aggressive
phenotype in certain kidney tumors.61
although ras mutations are associated with distinct cytogenetic subsets of aml and primary nodular melanomas,
they do not appear to affect clinical outcome in these tumor
types.60,62
constitutive  xxxg1924xxx  activation
due to dysregulated overexpression
of growth factors and/or their receptors
aberrant upregulation of  xxxg1924xxx  activity can be driven by
oncogenic mutations within upstream rtks,47 some well-vascularized solid tumors, including nsclc, rcc, and hcc, have
dysregulated upregulation of  xxxg1924xxx  activity in the absence of
oncogenic mutations within the rtk/ras/raf/mek/erk pathway. in these solid tumor types, the constitutive activation of
 xxxg1924xxx  is likely to be the consequence of growth factor receptor
overexpression.
the egfr is overexpressed in the majority of cases of
nsclc, and the proliferation of human nsclc cells has been
shown to be regulated by a tgf-␣/egfr-mediated autocrine
loop, which activates signaling via  xxxg1924xxx  and pi3k-akt.63,64
downregulation of the egfr or inhibition of signaling through
the egfr has been shown to inhibit human nsclc growth in
preclinical studies.63,64 egfr and tgf-␣ overexpression are frequently detected in early-stage nsclc but are not associated
with a survival difference, suggesting that this autocrine pathway is important in nsclc formation rather than progression.65
mutations within the egfr do occur in some (approximately
24%) cases of nsclc, mainly in late-stage tumors that are well
differentiated rather than in early-stage or poorly differentiated
tumors.66 interestingly, patients with egfr mutations appear to
have an improved response to the egfr  xxxg2198xxx  inhibitor, gefitinib.66
constitutive activation of signaling through  xxxg1924xxx  is common
in human rcc.67 the phosphorylated (activated) forms of  xxxg1924xxx 
and downstream mek are present in 55% and 50% of rcc
tumors, respectively.67 the activation of downstream erk also
occurs more frequently at higher tumor grades and correlates
with  xxxg1924xxx  activation. however, overactivation of  xxxg1924xxx , mek,
and erk occurs in the absence of oncogenic h-ras,  xxxg1285xxx , or  xxxg1605xxx 
in rcc.67 instead, rcc growth is associated with loss of function of the von hippel–lindau (vhl) tumor-suppressor gene
and consequent upregulation of the hif-␣ transcription factors,
including hif-1␣ and hif-2␣.68 hif-2␣ expression, in particular, has been linked to excessive secretion of tgf-␣, which
binds to egfr, thereby driving tumor cell proliferation through
an autocrine mechanism (as discussed later).68
dysregulated autocrine or paracrine production of insulinlike growth factor-1 (igf-1), and overexpression of the type i
igf receptor ( xxxg1145xxx ) have been implicated in human hepatic
carcinogenesis, suggesting that increased signaling through
downstream  xxxg1924xxx  may be involved in the dysregulated proliferation and apoptosis associated with the development of this
solid tumor type.69 overexpression of the  xxxg1924xxx  gene occurs in
50% of hcc biopsies, while increased activation of the  xxxg1924xxx 
protein has been found in 100% (30/30) of hcc biopsies evaluated in a recent study.70

396

role of  xxxg1924xxx  in
hormone-dependent cancer
dysregulated signaling through  xxxg1924xxx  has also been associated with hormone-dependent cancers. elevated  xxxg1924xxx  protein levels correlate with advanced grade and a poor prognosis in ovarian cancer patients, suggesting that dysfunctional
signaling through  xxxg1924xxx  may drive ovarian carcinogenesis.71
furthermore, a  xxxg1924xxx –specific inhibitory antisense oligonucleotide (isis 5132) reduces cellular proliferation and inhibits ovarian tumor cell growth in vitro and in vivo.71 growth
inhibition of human ovarian tumor lines by isis 5132 is
associated with increased apoptosis, suggesting that  xxxg1924xxx  is
important in mediating cell survival in this tumor type.72
hif-1␣ overexpression has been observed in invasive
breast cancer and correlated with increased angiogenesis,
and increased expression of egfr, and the growth factors
pdgf-␤ and  xxxg787xxx  ( xxxg787xxx ).73  xxxg1924xxx  is
a common downstream effector of tgf-␣/egfr-, pdgf-␤/
pdgfr-␤–, and  xxxg787xxx /fgfr-mediated signaling. amplification and activation of  xxxg721xxx , which belongs to the same
( xxxg682xxx ) receptor  xxxg2198xxx  family as the egfr, occurs in
a significant proportion of breast tumors.74 in addition, the
estrogen-stimulated or tgf-␣–stimulated growth of the
human mcf-7 breast tumor cell line has been shown to be
significantly inhibited by anti-egfr monoclonal antibodies
or a synthetic peptide egfr antagonist.75 the activity of
 xxxg1924xxx , which is downstream of  xxxg721xxx , has also been
shown to be greater among breast tumors than surrounding
non-cancerous glands.74 tyrphostin ag879 has been shown
to inhibit the proliferation of human breast tumor cells via
inhibition of the expression of the  xxxg1924xxx  gene. in these tumor
cells, ag879 also inhibited the expression of  xxxg721xxx .74
 xxxg1924xxx  expression also correlates with expression of her-2
and c-fos in androgen-insensitive prostate cancer (aipc).
furthermore, patients whose tumoral  xxxg1924xxx  levels increase
with development of aipc have a significantly shorter time to
biochemical relapse.76 high levels of expression of the raf
kinase inhibitor protein ( xxxg1723xxx ) are also associated with significantly improved prognosis.77 prostate cancer patients
with high  xxxg1723xxx  levels have a 7-year  xxxg1281xxx 
(psa) level of less than 10%, compared with 50% (p ⬍.001)
for patients with low  xxxg1723xxx  levels.77

activating b-raf mutations in
melanoma and papillary thyroid cancer
activating b-raf mutations occur at a high frequency in
certain human cancers. the most common oncogenic variant, b-raf v600e, is present in 63% of melanomas,78 40% of
sporadic colorectal tumors with high microsatellite instability,79 38% to 50% of papillary thyroid carcinomas
(ptcs),80,81 and in some cases of nsclc.78
oncogenic missense mutations (predominantly v600e)
resulting in constitutive b-raf activation and phosphorylation of the downstream erk kinase are found in 60% to 70%
of benign nevi, vertical growth phase (vgp) melanomas,
metastatic melanomas, and melanoma cell lines. however,
such mutations are present in only 10% of radial growth

j.a. gollob et al
phase (rgp) melanomas.82 the relative absence of b-raf
mutations in rgp melanoma, and the finding that mutated
b-raf cannot substitute for mutated ras or constitutively
activated pi 3-kinase to generate human melanocytic neoplasia in vitro, suggest that mutated b-raf is probably not involved in melanoma initiation.83 however, there are ample
data implicating b-raf and erk activation in melanoma cell
growth and survival.
in melanoma, aberrant b-raf activation can occur through
activating missense mutation and/or gene amplification. in
one study, 32 of 40 (80%) malignant melanoma cell lines
contained activating b-raf mutations, while wild-type b-raf
was overexpressed in the remaining eight cell lines.84 downregulating b-raf expression in melanoma cell lines using
rnai inhibits mek/erk activation, induces growth arrest
and apoptosis, and results in loss of the transformed phenotype.85,86 b-raf activation may also contribute to the malignant phenotype of melanoma through erk-mediated microphthalmia transcription factor (mitf) phosphorylation.
mitf, via its control of bcl-2 and  xxxg410xxx  expression, has been
implicated in the growth and survival of melanocytes and
melanoma cells.87,88 a recent study showed mitf gene amplification in approximately 15% to 20% of advanced melanomas, and this amplification was associated with poor prognosis.89 importantly, the combination of mitf overexpression
and b-raf activation was able to transform melanocytes in
vitro, whereas neither manipulation alone led to transformation. this suggests that there may be an important interaction
between mitf and activated b-raf that contributes to the
malignant behavior of melanoma.
autocrine growth pathways signaling through b-raf may
also be important in melanoma. signaling through b-raf/
mek/erk as a consequence of the binding of paracrine
factors, such as  xxxg787xxx  and  xxxg1044xxx  (hgf),
to their cognate receptors  xxxg791xxx  and c-met is critical for the
proliferation, survival, and migration of normal melanocytes.90 aberrant upregulation of these growth factors by an
autocrine loop involving constitutive raf/mek/erk signaling is
also associated with melanocytic tumorigenesis.90 serumstarved melanoma cells show constitutive activation of signaling through erk (ie, elevated phospho-erk 1/2 [perk]),
which is not detected in serum-deprived normal melanocytes.90 furthermore, the constitutive activation of erk
in melanoma cells can be inhibited by a mek inhibitor
( xxxd1169xxx ), antisense  xxxg787xxx , and neutralizing anti-hgf
antibodies.90 immunohistochemical analyses have also demonstrated greatly elevated staining for perk in primary and
metastatic melanoma tissue compared with normal melanocyte and nevus tissue samples.90 the absence of oncogenic
ras and the prevalence of oncogenic b-raf mutations in melanomas suggest that b-raf may have a causative role in driving
the autocrine loop that results in the perk elevations that are
associated with the induction and progression of malignant
melanoma.
dysregulated signaling via the raf/mek/erk pathway
appears to play a role in malignant transformation in ptc,
which is the most prevalent endocrine malignancy in
humans. the most common activating mutations detected in

targeting  xxxg1924xxx  in cancer
ptc are ret, ras, and b-raf point mutations, which occur in
at least 70% of all cases,91 but are mutually exclusive and
rarely expressed simultaneously within the same tumor.81
point mutations within b-raf are the most common activating
event in ptc (up to 50%), whereas ret rearrangements
(30%, mainly in adult sporadic cases) and oncogenic ras
mutations (10%, mainly in the follicular variant) occur at
lower frequencies.81

raf isoforms and
tumor progression
dysregulated overexpression of raf isoforms is also associated with tumor progression. raf isoforms are involved as
downstream effectors of angiogenesis, which is essential for
the establishment of the necessary vasculature to facilitate
solid tumor growth beyond 2 to 3 mm3. furthermore, raf
overexpression has been associated with a more aggressive
and invasive tumor phenotype and has, therefore, been
implicated in promoting tumor metastasis.

raf as a downstream
effector of angiogenesis
tumor-induced angiogenesis is the process by which new blood
vessels develop from the endothelium of the pre-existing vasculature to supply the tumor with the necessary nutrients to facilitate tumor growth, and is essential for malignant growth, invasion, and metastasis.92 solid tumors aberrantly secrete up to 20
different growth factors and cytokines, including the proangiogenic factors (tgf-␣, vegf, pdgf-␤, and  xxxg787xxx ), which are
upregulated by intratumoral hypoxia.93 angiogenesis involves
destabilization of the existing microvasculature, resulting in vascular hyperpermeability and matrix remodeling, and transition
of existing endothelial cells from a quiescent to a plastic proliferative phenotype.94 activated endothelial cells then proliferate,
migrate, and undergo cord formation, leading to tubulogenesis
(ie, formation of new microvessels).94 the final stage involves
the differentiation, proliferation, and recruitment of mural cells,
such as pericytes, which stabilize the newly formed vasculature.94 however, unlike angiogenesis under normal physiologic
conditions, it appears that tumor-induced angiogenesis results
in new microvessels with multiple structural and functional
abnormalities.95
the angiogenic effects of hypoxia-induced, tumor-derived
growth factors ( xxxg2413xxx ,  xxxg787xxx , pdgf-␤) are summarized in
table 1. all of these growth factors induce signaling through
raf/mek/erk via activation of cognate receptors on the
surface of endothelial cells and/or pericytes.
two of the most widely studied proangiogenic growth
factors, vegf and  xxxg787xxx , have been shown to promote angiogenesis both in vivo and in vitro. furthermore, these proangiogenic factors also induce mitogenesis and enhance capillary
morphogenesis in vivo.96 the vascular abnormalities and embryonic lethality observed in vegf and vegfr k/o mice and
the in vivo regression of tumor vasculature induced by vegf/
vegfr inhibitors, suggest a pivotal role for vegf in promoting
tumor survival and angiogenesis.97 in particular, signaling

through  xxxg2413xxx / xxxg1274xxx  has been shown to be of pivotal
importance in stimulating angiogenesis.98
several lines of evidence support the importance of signaling
through raf/mek/erk in stimulating angiogenesis.  xxxg1924xxx  k/o
mice die from vascular defects in the yolk sac, associated with an
increased propensity for apoptosis.13,32,33 b-raf k/o mice also die
in utero from massive vascular hemorrhaging associated with
increased vascular endothelial cell apoptosis.13 raf isoforms
may, therefore, be of particular importance in mediating endothelial cell survival, and there is evidence to suggest that raf
achieves this through both mek/erk-dependent and -independent mechanisms. the binding of vegf to vegfr on the
surface of endothelial cells activates src kinase, which, in turn,
phosphorylates  xxxg1924xxx  at tyrosine residues 340 and 341 to confer
resistance to tnf-mediated apoptosis via a mek/erk-dependent mechanism.99 in addition,  xxxg787xxx  binds its cognate receptor
on endothelial cells to activate pak-1, which subsequently
phosphorylates  xxxg1924xxx  at serine residues 338 and 339 to elicit
 xxxg1924xxx  translocation to the mitochondrial compartment to inhibit
apoptosis via a mek/erk-independent mechanism.99

raf and tumor metastasis
the majority of patients with cancer die from the complications of metastatic disease.100 activated ras mutations are
associated with approximately 50% of all metastatic tumors,

j.a. gollob et al

398
suggesting a role for aberrant signaling through downstream
 xxxg1924xxx  in metastatic spread.100
the expression of pak-1, which stimulates  xxxg1924xxx –mediated,
mek/erk-independent, cell survival pathways,39 has been
shown to increase with progression of colorectal carcinomas. in
an immunohistochemical study, pak-1 levels increased with
increasing stages of progression from adenomas to invasive carcinomas to lymph node metastases.101 the levels of pak-1 at
each stage of tumor progression were significantly raised relative
to normal colon tissue, and the levels in lymph node metastases
were significantly higher than in adenomas and invasive carcinomas.101 the presence of oncogenic  xxxg1285xxx , which drives  xxxg1924xxx 
overexpression, was associated with a significant risk of recurrence and death in colon carcinoma patients, irrespective of
disease stage, in the large multicenter “kirsten-ras-in-colorectal
cancer collaborative group” or rascal study.58 in the follow-up rascal ii study, which analyzed data from 3,439 patients worldwide, the presence of a specific mutation (glycine to
valine) on codon 12, found in 8.6% of all patients, was associated with significantly reduced overall survival and failure-free
survival, particularly in patients with higher grade (ie, dukes’
c v dukes’ b).102
preclinical studies support the role of  xxxg1924xxx  in promoting
metastases. nih 3t3 fibroblasts that have been transfected
with ras mutants that activate  xxxg1924xxx  form metastases in
mice.103 in contrast, fibroblasts transfected with ras mutants
unable to activate  xxxg1924xxx  do not form metastases in mice.103
metastatic colon tumor cells entering the hepatic circulation
induce a cytokine cascade, which upregulates  xxxg2048xxx  on
hepatic endothelial cells via signaling through  xxxg1924xxx .104 however, pretreatment with  xxxg1924xxx  antisense oligonucleotides prevents the adhesion of human cx-1 crc cells to hepatic endothelial cells in vitro.104 also, pretreatment of nude mice
with  xxxg1924xxx  antisense oligonucleotides prevents induction of
 xxxg2048xxx  by intrasplenic/portal inoculation of cx-1 cells,
reducing the number of hepatic metastases by 86% compared with controls.104 the presence of b-raf v600e mutations also correlates with increased tendency to metastasize
to the liver or to multiple organs.105 oncogenic b-raf mutations have also recently been implicated in facilitating the
metastasis and progression of ptc in lymph nodes.106
 xxxg1723xxx , which downregulates  xxxg1924xxx  activity, has also
recently been proposed as a suppressor of metastasis in prostate cancer.107 loss of  xxxg1723xxx  expression confers a metastatic
phenotype on prostate cancer cells. furthermore, restoring
functional  xxxg1723xxx  activity in metastatic prostate cancer cells
does not affect primary tumor growth, but inhibits their ability to metastasize.107

raf: role in
radio- and chemoresistance
an essential strategy for any novel targeted anticancer agent
involves the abrogation of tumor cell resistance to treatmentinduced growth inhibition and cell death. such resistance has
hindered the clinical effectiveness of standard radiotherapy and
cytotoxic chemotherapies. however, resistance has also been

observed with targeted agents like imatinib, which act by blocking a single target within the tumor (bcr-abl in chronic myelogenous leukemia, c-kit in gastrointestinal stromal tumors
[gist]), thereby eventually selecting for clones that escape the
effects of the drug via single point mutations in the target.108,109
since several studies have implicated  xxxg1924xxx –mediated signaling in the development of a radioresistant and/or chemoresistant phenotype, a novel targeted agent that inhibits
 xxxg1924xxx  may have utility in combination with chemotherapies
and/or radiation therapy, to overcome tumor resistance
mechanisms. we will therefore discuss the rationale for  xxxg1924xxx 
as a target for overcoming tumor resistance to conventional
therapies prior to discussing novel  xxxg1924xxx –targeted agents currently in preclinical and clinical development.
 xxxg1924xxx  overexpression and activation by protein tyrosine
kinases has been demonstrated to increase the survival response
of mammalian cells to the toxic effects of ionizing radiation.31
the development of a radioresistant phenotype by transfected
rat intestinal epithelial cells expressing oncogenic ras in response to ionizing radiation was shown to involve  xxxg1924xxx  and
 xxxg1743xxx -kinase signaling pathways, but was unaffected by inhibition
of mek.110 this suggests the involvement of mek-independent
 xxxg1924xxx –mediated pathways in the development of radioresistance. interestingly, transfection of radioresistant human squamous carcinoma cells with a vector expressing antisense  xxxg1924xxx 
cdna renders them susceptible to the cytotoxic effects of ionizing radiation.31 furthermore,  xxxg1924xxx  antisense oligonucleotides
have been shown to reverse the radioresistant phenotype of
several human tumor cell lines containing either elevated her-2
expression or an oncogenic h-ras gene.111,112 however, treatment with ras (l744,832),  xxxg1743xxx -kinase ( xxxd2523xxx ), or p38
( xxxd3177xxx ) inhibitors had no such effect on these radiationresistant tumor cells.112
 xxxg1924xxx  has also been implicated in the acquisition of tumor
resistance to standard chemotherapies by prolonging cell
survival via mek/erk-independent and -dependent anti-apoptotic mechanisms.113 overexpression of constitutively
active  xxxg1924xxx  increases the resistance of human mcf-7 breast
cancer cells to the standard chemotherapeutic agents doxorubicin and paclitaxel.114 aberrant signaling through  xxxg1924xxx 
has also been implicated in inducing the expression of the
multidrug resistance gene (mdr-1), which is also associated
with resistance to standard chemotherapies.115

raf as a target
for anticancer agents
the concept of raf-targeted disruption of cell signaling for
therapeutic purposes was first advanced in 1989 with the
demonstration of tumor growth inhibition in athymic
mice.116 several agents have been designed that target raf and
are in various stages of clinical development.

antisense oligonucleotides
the antisense oligonucleotide isis 5132 targets  xxxg1924xxx  mrna,
downregulating  xxxg1924xxx  activity and inhibiting tumor cell growth
and metastatic spread in vivo and in vitro in preclinical studies.

targeting  xxxg1924xxx  in cancer
however, isis 5132 failed to meet its clinical end points (ie, no
objective responses) in phase ii trials in patients with hormonerefractory prostate cancer, colorectal cancer, and ovarian cancer.
consequently, the clinical development of isis 5132 has been
halted.117-119 however, isis 5132 did induce sustained stable
disease in a proportion of cancer patients in these trials, suggesting that it may have a cytostatic effect.117-119 the failure of isis
5132 to progress through clinical development may reflect poor
trial design. specifically, there is currently considerable debate
as to the appropriateness of standard cytotoxic therapy endpoints based on tumor shrinkage (response evaluation criteria
in solid tumors [recist]/world health organization [who]
criteria) as measures of anti-tumor efficacy with targeted agents
that may induce stable disease rather than being overtly cytotoxic. a liposomal formulation of isis 5132 (lerafaon) has
been developed in an attempt to overcome degradation issues
and to improve intracellular delivery.120 however, it has been
associated with dose-dependent thrombocytopenia in a phase i
trial in patients with advanced refractory cancer.120

 xxxg1924xxx  destabilizers
as a molecular chaperone, the heat-shock protein hsp90 is
involved in the refolding of misfolded proteins and in the
removal of irreversibly damaged proteins. direct association
with hsp90 is also a prerequisite for the stability and functioning of a number of oncogenic proteins that are either mutated or
overexpressed in a variety of tumor types.121 the  xxxg1924xxx 
destabilizer 17-allylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin ( xxxd717xxx )
is an  xxxd3116xxx  antibiotic that binds to a highly conserved pocket
within hsp90, thereby preventing it from forming a molecular
complex with client proteins including  xxxg1924xxx .121 this leads to destabilization and subsequent degradation of  xxxg1924xxx . phase i and ii
clinical trials of  xxxd717xxx  are underway.122

mek inhibitors
 xxxd2856xxx  (pfizer)123-125 and  xxxd3190xxx  ( xxxd3190xxx ,
array and astrazeneca) are small-molecule mek inhibitors currently in clinical development.126,127 these two orally available
agents are non– xxxd83xxx  (atp) competitive allosteric inhibitors of mek, which unlike the majority of atpcompetitive analogs, show high selectivity for mek in biochemical assays.123-127  xxxd2856xxx  is a second-generation
compound derived from  xxxd1688xxx .123-125  xxxd2856xxx  has an
ic50 value 200-fold lower than  xxxd1688xxx , and is also more soluble with improved metabolic stability and bioavailability.123-125
 xxxd2856xxx  and  xxxd3190xxx  have shown potent antitumor activity in tumor xenograft models.125-127  xxxd3190xxx 
is currently being evaluated in phase i trials, while phase i/ii
clinical trial findings have recently been reported with  xxxd2856xxx .123-125  xxxd2856xxx  has shown a partial response (pr)
in two melanoma patients and stable disease (sd) in eight patients (five melanoma, two nsclc, and one colon cancer patient) for a duration of 3 to 7 months.124

small-molecule  xxxg1924xxx  inhibitors
sorafenib is a synthetic, orally available bi-aryl urea. although originally developed based on its in vitro ability to

399
inhibit  xxxg1924xxx , sorafenib has also been shown to inhibit wildtype b-raf and b-raf v600e serine/threonine kinases, and the
 xxxg1274xxx ,  xxxg802xxx , pdgfr-␤, c-kit, and  xxxg801xxx  tyrosine kinases in vitro.15 sorafenib is the most promising of the raf
kinase inhibitors in clinical development, and is being evaluated in phase iii clinical trials, one of which has recently
been completed in patients with advanced rcc. it is also
unique among the  xxxg1924xxx  inhibitors in its ability to inhibit
b-raf in addition to  xxxg1924xxx .
effects of sorafenib on raf isoforms
sorafenib strongly inhibits raf isoforms, with an order of
potency:  xxxg1924xxx  ⬎ wild-type b-raf ⬎ oncogenic b-raf v600e in
vitro; however, it has no significant effect on mek-1 or  xxxg1369xxx 
kinase activity (table 2).15,128 in cellular assays, sorafenib inhibits the phosphorylation (ie, activation) of erk 1/2 (perk) and
 xxxg1361xxx /2 (pmek), supporting its raf inhibitory effects in human
cells.15,128 sorafenib also reduces perk levels in tumor cell lines
with oncogenic  xxxg1285xxx  (mia-paca2, pancreatic; hct 116, colon,)
or b-raf v600e (lox, melanoma; ht-29, colon) mutations.15 in
addition, sorafenib reduces the levels of activated pmek and
perk, and completely inhibits cell growth in mda-mb-231
breast tumor cells containing oncogenic g463v b-raf and  xxxg1285xxx 
mutations.15 the absence of an effect of sorafenib on protein
kinase b—a downstream effector molecule of the ras-activated
 xxxg1743xxx -kinase pathway— demonstrates the selectivity of this novel
inhibitor for the raf/mek/erk pathway.15 however, sorafenib
has no effect on perk levels in a549 or nci-h460 nsclc
tumor cells, despite the fact that they both contain oncogenic
 xxxg1285xxx  mutations.15
preclinical studies demonstrating the dose-dependent
growth inhibitory effects of sorafenib on human colon and
breast tumor xenografts containing activating  xxxg1285xxx  or b-raf mutations also support its inhibitory effects on raf isoforms in vivo
(fig 2).15 sorafenib (30 and 60 mg/kg) treatment induced complete tumor stasis in three human colon (ht-29 and colo-205
[both b-raf–positive], and dld-1 [ xxxg1285xxx –positive]) tumor xenograft models (fig 2).15 sorafenib also has activity against ovarian
(sk-ov-3, overexpressing egf/her-2 receptor), pancreatic,

breast, and melanoma xenograft models.15 sorafenib also
induces complete tumor stasis in a549 nsclc and colo-205
colon xenografts, and partially inhibits the growth of nsclc
nci-h460 xenografts, despite the fact that it is unable to inhibit
perk formation in these tumors (fig 2).15
these observations suggest that sorafenib likely acts
through multiple mechanisms in addition to inhibition of
signaling through mek and erk in certain tumor types.15
these alternative mechanisms could include the inhibition of
the direct (mek/erk-independent) anti-apoptotic effects of
 xxxg1924xxx  and/or inhibition of proangiogenic receptor tyrosine
kinase signaling pathways, such as the  xxxg1274xxx /raf/mek/
erk and pdgfr-␤ pathways in vascular endothelial cells
and pericytes, respectively.
recent observations of perk as a biomarker in phase ii clinical trials also support a role for raf inhibition in the mechanism
of action of sorafenib in vivo. in a recent phase ii trial of patients
with advanced inoperable hcc, in which continuous administration of sorafenib 400 mg twice daily demonstrated
anti-tumor activity, tumor biopsies from 33 patients were evaluated immunohistochemically for perk at baseline. the observed significant correlation of increased baseline perk staining intensity with prolonged time to progression (p ⬍.001)
suggests that high baseline perk levels may predict response to
sorafenib.129
proapoptotic effects of sorafenib
a recent study has shown that sorafenib may act on a549
nsclc cells by downregulating the levels of the anti-apoptotic protein  xxxg1388xxx  to trigger cell death.16 sorafenib also
induces apoptosis in several other human cancer cell lines by
downregulating  xxxg1388xxx  protein levels in a time- and dosedependent manner. this was shown to occur through
enhanced proteasomal degradation of  xxxg1388xxx , which could be
the consequence of  xxxg1924xxx  inhibition.16,17
inhibitory effects of
sorafenib on pro-angiogenic rtks
the inhibitory actions of sorafenib on tumor angiogenesis also
contribute to its anti-tumor activity. sorafenib potently inhibits

figure 2 sorafenib anti-tumor activity in animal models of human
colon, breast, and non-small cell lung cancer (nsclc) expressing
 xxxg1285xxx  and/or b-raf mutations.

j.a. gollob et al
the proangiogenic  xxxg1274xxx  (human and murine),  xxxg802xxx ,
and pdgfr-␤ (both murine) tyrosine kinases, which are all
upstream of  xxxg1924xxx , in in vitro biochemical assays (table 2). in
cellular assays, sorafenib inhibits the vegf-mediated autophosphorylation of  xxxg1274xxx  in human umbilical vein endothelial
cells and nih-3t3 fibroblasts expressing  xxxg1274xxx .15 sorafenib
also prevents pdgf-␤–mediated autophosphorylation of
pdgfr-␤ and proliferation of human aortic smooth muscle
cells.15 furthermore, sorafenib inhibits angiogenesis, as demonstrated by a significant reduction in microvessel area and microvessel density in established ht-29 and colo-205 human
colon tumor xenografts and in mda-mb-231 human breast
cancer xenografts.15
in a model of renal cancer in which renca tumors are
implanted in the subrenal capsule of mice, sorafenib induced
dose-dependent tumor growth inhibition. sorafenib had no effect on tumor proliferation but dose-dependently inhibited endothelial (cd-31) and smooth muscle (␣sma) cell microvessel
area, markers of tumor neovascularization. this suggests that in
this renal cancer model, inhibition of tumor growth occurs primarily by inhibition of angiogenesis.15,18 however, the effects of
sorafenib on perk-independent signaling and survival of human renal cancer cells are currently under investigation.

targeting
melanoma with sorafenib
the high incidence of activating b-raf mutations in melanoma
makes sorafenib an attractive agent for the treatment of this
disease, especially because preclinical data suggest that b-raf
inhibition can affect melanoma growth and survival. however,
in a small phase ii trial of sorafenib monotherapy, in which the
drug was given to patients with metastatic melanoma at a dose of
400 mg orally twice per day in 12-week cycles, there was only
one pr and three cases of sd among 20 patients.130 although
this small trial did not show whether b-raf activity was inhibited
in vivo, the results raise the possibility that b-raf inhibition by
itself may not be sufficient to affect tumor growth and viability in
melanoma patients.
another approach in melanoma patients involved combining
carboplatin/paclitaxel with sorafenib. strikingly, in a recent
phase ii trial, in which sorafenib 400 mg orally twice per day was
given along with 21-day cycles of paclitaxel (225 mg/m2) plus
carboplatin (auc 6), this combination induced prs in 11 of 32
(34%) evaluable patients with metastatic melanoma.131 the regimen also provided a sustained response in 10 patients (ie, sustained response rate 31%) who had been receiving treatment for
3 to 16 months at the last evaluation.131 the sorafenib/carboplatin/paclitaxel combination also induced sd in 19 of 32 (59%)
evaluable melanoma patients, which was sustained in 12
patients (38%) and ongoing at the last evaluation.131 in the small
number of patients whose tumors were examined for mutated
b-raf, there was no clear association between response to therapy and b-raf mutational status.
although these early trials suggest that b-raf inhibition may
not have activity in melanoma by itself but may enhance responsiveness to chemotherapy, the clinical impact of this approach in

targeting  xxxg1924xxx  in cancer

figure 3 the vhl tumor-suppressor gene controls hif-␣ expression. tissue hypoxia or loss of vhl function leads to upregulation of
hif-␣ expression and overexpression of hypoxia-inducible growth
factors, including vegf and pdgf-␤, which bind to  xxxg1274xxx 
( xxxg1274xxx ) and pdgfr-␤, respectively, and tgf-␣, which binds egfr.
in addition, hif-␣ upregulates egfr.  xxxg1924xxx  is downstream of
 xxxg1274xxx , pdgfr-␤, and egfr. hif-␣ also upregulates a number
of other hypoxia-inducible genes.149

melanoma remains to be determined. several randomized phase
ii/iii trials are currently underway, comparing chemotherapy
using either carboplatin/paclitaxel or  xxxd1796xxx  with chemotherapy plus sorafenib. if sorafenib is found to enhance the
response to chemotherapy, it will still be possible that this is not
necessarily due to b-raf inhibition, but rather to inhibition of
vegfr and pdgfr-␤. for example, in certain murine solid
tumor models, inhibition of pericyte function through
pdgfr-␤ blockade renders tumor vascular endothelial cells
more sensitive to the toxic effects of both vegfr inhibition and
chemotherapy.132 along the same lines, the effects of  xxxg1924xxx 
inhibition on vegfr and pdgfr-␤ signaling may also play a
role in the ability of sorafenib to enhance the anti-tumor effect of
chemotherapy in melanoma, independent of b-raf mutational
status.

molecular basis
of rcc: rationale for
targeting raf with sorafenib
loss of function of the vhl tumor-suppressor gene, which
resides on the short arm of chromosome 3, and consequent
hif-␣ upregulation have been observed in most cases of
clear-cell rcc.133 the normal function of the vhl gene
product ( xxxg2415xxx ) is to downregulate expression of the hif-␣
transcription factors under normoxic conditions.133-138 this
downregulation is achieved by  xxxg2415xxx  forming a multi-protein complex that ubiquitinates the ␣-subunit of hif, thereby
targeting it for proteasomal degradation.133-138 however,
under conditions of tissue hypoxia, or upon loss of vhl gene
function, hif-1␣ and hif-2␣ accumulate in the tumor cell to
induce the overexpression and secretion of several hypoxiainducible growth factors (fig 3). these include vegf isoforms
that act in a paracrine manner by binding to distinct vegfrs on
endothelial cells, which share  xxxg1924xxx  as a downstream effector.
activation of the vegfr/raf/mek/erk axis results in vegf

figure 4 vegf isoforms participate in both angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis by binding to distinct vegfr isoforms.150

secretion by endothelial cells, and the induction of angiogenesis
(eg,  xxxg1274xxx ) and lymphangiogenesis ( xxxg802xxx ) by an autocrine mechanism. (figs 4 through 6).133-138 this dysregulated
vegf overexpression is a key factor in the angiogenesis and
hypervascularity that is characteristic of clear-cell rcc.133-138
serum levels of vegf are also predictive of progression in
rcc.139  xxxg2413xxx  exerts the majority of its angiogenic effects by
activating  xxxg1274xxx  ( xxxg1274xxx ) on the surface of endothelial cells
(figs 5 and 6).140
pdgf-␤ secretion by tumor cells is also induced following
upregulation of hif-␣.141 it is then able to bind to pdgfr-␤
on the surface of pericytes and smooth muscle cells to recruit
them to the tumor microvasculature, thereby stabilizing the
newly formed tumor blood vessels (fig 6).136 like vegfr,
pdgfr-␤ signaling involves raf/erk activation.
egfr is overexpressed in 60% to 90% of rccs, and linked
to high tumor grade, lung metastasis, and poor prognosis.142
tumorigenesis in rcc cells lacking the vhl gene (vhl⫺/⫺)
has been shown to be dependent on the tgf-␣/egfr autocrine pathway.68,143 tgf-␣, but not egf, is the egfr ligand
that is overexpressed by vhl⫺/⫺ rcc cells,143 and tgf-␣
appears to be upregulated by hif-2␣ in vhl⫺/⫺ rcc cells.68
inhibition of egfr expression in vhl⫺/⫺ rcc cells abolishes

tumorigenesis in vhl⫺/⫺ rcc cells.68 whereas upregulation
of vegf and pdgf-␤ by hif-1␣ in tumor cells lacking vhl
promotes angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis in rcc, the
upregulation of tgf-␣ by hif-2␣ may promote tumor cell
growth and survival through an autocrine pathway that
involves egfr activation by tgf-␣ (fig 6).
activation of the raf/mek/erk pathway is known to be an
important component of egfr signaling.144 since activating
mutations in egfr, ras, or raf have not been detected in rcc,
it is possible that the high frequency of constitutive erk activation detected in rcc67 may be a reflection of dysregulated tgf␣/egfr signaling due to loss of vhl and upregulation of hif-␣.
raf inhibition may therefore affect rcc by blocking this autocrine tgf-␣/egfr pathway in tumor cells and by blocking a
critical component of vegfr and pdgfr-␤ signaling in vascular endothelial cells and pericytes, respectively (fig 6). therefore, the multi-targeted inhibition of  xxxg1924xxx  and the proangiogenic rtks  xxxg1274xxx  and pdgfr-␤ is a rational approach for
the treatment of clear-cell rcc (fig 6).

sorafenib efficacy and safety in rcc
phase ii randomized discontinuation trial
in a recently completed large randomized discontinuation trial
(rdt), patients with advanced refractory metastatic rcc
received sorafenib for an initial run-in phase of 12 weeks. patients with sd were then randomized to receive sorafenib or
placebo. significantly more patients who were randomized to
sorafenib (16/32, 50%) were found to be progression-free at 12
weeks post-randomization, compared with those randomized
to placebo (6/33, 18%; p ⬍.0077).145 median progression-free
survival (pfs) following randomization was also significantly
prolonged (fourfold) for sorafenib versus placebo (p ⫽
.0087).145 overall, continuous oral dosing with sorafenib 400
mg twice daily was well tolerated by advanced refractory rcc
patients participating in the rdt. grade 3– 4 adverse events

were rare, and although hypertension was reported in 24% of
patients, it was easily managed with antihypertensive medication and was rarely the reason for discontinuing sorafenib therapy.145 sorafenib also demonstrated anti-tumor activity in a cohort of 32 patients with rcc who had not received prior
systemic therapy at study entry.146 six (18.8%) of these patients
experienced a pr, eight (25%) had a minor response (mr), and
10 (31.3%) had sd with sorafenib treatment.146 hence, according to modified who criteria, first-line sorafenib treatment was
associated with a 75% clinical benefit (complete response ⫹ pr
⫹ mr ⫹ sd) in rcc patients.146 the median pfs for the firsttime cohort was 40 weeks.146
phase iii targets
the phase iii multicenter, double-blind, randomized “treatment approaches in renal cancer global evaluation trial”
(targets) was primarily designed to determine whether continuous oral administration of sorafenib improves overall survival compared with placebo in a large sample of patients with
advanced rcc. this multinational trial, conducted in 117
centers in 19 countries, is the largest randomized controlled trial
performed to date in patients with unresectable or metastatic
rcc.146 a preplanned analysis of pfs involving 769 randomized patients demonstrated that sorafenib achieved statistical
and clinical significance in prolongation of the median pfs (a
secondary end point in the study). sorafenib significantly increased (doubled) the median pfs compared with placebo (167
days [24 weeks] v 84 days [12 weeks]; p ⬍.000001).147 patients
who received sorafenib also had a 56% decreased risk of progression compared with placebo recipients.147 in addition, sorafenib treatment was associated with a 39% improvement in
overall survival (p ⬍.018; hazard ratio, 0.72), according to an
analysis based on 220 events, performed prior to patient crossover.148 patient crossover was permitted due to a protocol
amendment once sorafenib had met its secondary end point. a

targeting  xxxg1924xxx  in cancer
final overall survival (the primary end point) will be undertaken
after 540 events.148 sorafenib was generally well tolerated, and
grade 3– 4 adverse events were rare and mostly similar in frequency to the placebo group. hypertension, a known effect of
vegf/vegfr blockade, was reported in 8% of treated patients
in the phase iii trial.

summary
isoforms of the  xxxg1924xxx  function both as gatekeepers to the
ubiquitous raf/mek/erk signaling pathway, and as direct mediators of mek/erk-independent cellular proliferation and survival. dysregulated signaling through  xxxg1924xxx  (nsclc, rcc, and
hcc) or through oncogenic b-raf v600e (malignant cutaneous
melanoma and ptc) has been implicated in the pathogenesis
and malignant phenotype of several human solid tumors that
are notoriously resistant to conventional chemotherapy and radiation. therefore, raf serine/threonine kinases are logical targets for anticancer drug design for these malignancies.
of the known agents that target raf, sorafenib is at the most
advanced stage of clinical development, and appears to offer the
most promise. there are compelling molecular rationales for the
use of sorafenib across a broad spectrum of solid tumor types,
including nsclc, rcc, hcc, melanoma, and ptc, as well as
certain hormone-dependent cancers (ovarian, breast, prostate).
preclinical studies have confirmed the anti-tumor activity of sorafenib in several cancer models, including rcc. as an oral
multi-kinase inhibitor, sorafenib may have effects on both the
tumor (antiproliferative, proapoptotic) and tumor vasculature
(antiangiogenic), as confirmed in vitro and in animal models.
furthermore, as a raf inhibitor, sorafenib may also abrogate
mechanisms of tumor resistance, although further trials are
required to investigate this putative effect. the striking antitumor effects of sorafenib in combination with carboplatin/paclitaxel, in comparison with its modest activity as a monotherapy
in patients with advanced melanoma, also suggest that sorafenib
may enhance the effectiveness of chemotherapies against chemoresistant solid tumors.
however, the fact that sorafenib is an oral multi-kinase inhibitor, with effects on several molecular targets in addition to the
raf isoforms, including  xxxg1274xxx /3, pdgfr-␤, c-kit, and  xxxg801xxx ,
makes it difficult to determine which of these targets contributes
most to its anti-tumor activity in particular tumor types. the
recent phase ii hcc clinical trial, which identified an association between high baseline tumor perk levels and improved
response to sorafenib, suggests that inhibition of raf/mek/erk
is important in sorafenib’s mechanism of effect in hcc. however, more trials are needed to confirm precisely how sorafenib
is acting in other solid tumor types, such as rcc and melanoma.
preclinical evidence suggests that sorafenib acts primarily by an
anti-angiogenic mechanism in an animal model of renal carcinoma. however, it remains to be determined whether this effect
is mediated by  xxxg1274xxx /pdgfr-␤  xxxg2198xxx  inhibition,
or whether inhibition of  xxxg1924xxx , which is downstream of these
proangiogenic receptors, is also a major contributor to this
effect. even though its precise mechanism of effect has yet to be
determined, sorafenib has certainly shown promise in phase ii
and iii clinical trials in patients with advanced rcc, in which it

403
has demonstrated a significant progression-free survival advantage compared with placebo.
future studies examining the in vivo effects of sorafenib on
raf/mek/erk signaling and downstream effectors of these
kinases in tumor cells, vascular endothelial cells, and pericytes
will shed more light on how raf inhibition may be mediating
tumor responses to sorafenib in rcc, melanoma, and perhaps
other tumors exhibiting dysregulation of this pathway.
based on its phase ii and iii trial results, sorafenib was
recently approved for the treatment of advanced rcc in the
united states (december 2005), switzerland (march 2006),
and mexico (april 2006).
