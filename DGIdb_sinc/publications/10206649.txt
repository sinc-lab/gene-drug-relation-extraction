methods

protein preparations and solutions. rat liver myosin-i (130k, the myr-1a

gene product) and chicken brush-border myosin-i were isolated by gel
®ltration, anion and cation exchange chromatography as described7,13. rabbit
skeletal-muscle myosin s1, rhodamine-phalloidin-labelled f-actin and n-ethyl
maleimide (nem)-modi®ed myosin were also prepared by standard
methods20,21.
we used an optical tweezers transducer that is built around a zeiss axiovert
microscope6. experiments were performed within a `¯ow-cell' made from a
microscope slide and pieces of coverslip. glass microspheres (1.7 mm) were
applied to the coverslip surface as a suspension in 0.1% w/v nitrocellulose/amyl
acetate. after drying this was made into a 0.1-mm-deep ¯ow-cell and either
bbm-1, myr-1 or skeletal s1 was allowed to bind to the coverslip surface using
0.2, 0.2 and 1 mg  xxxg1167xxx  of protein, respectively, in a buffered salt solution21
(containing in mm: 25 kcl, 25 imidazole, 4 mgcl2, 1 egta, ph 7.4, 23 8c).
the solution was replaced with one containing rhodamine-phalloidin-labelled
actin ®laments and 1.1 mm polystyrene beads which were pre-coated with
nem-modi®ed myosin (and the buffered salt solution was supplemented with,
in mm: 2 creatine phosphate, 20 dithiothreitol (dtt), 0.01 to 0.1 atp; and in
mg  xxxg1167xxx : 1 creatine phosphokinase, 0.5 bsa, 3 glucose, 0.1 glucose oxidase,
0.02 catalase22. a single actin ®lament was captured between two polystyrene
beads held suspended in mid-solution in two independent optical tweezers23,6
in the vicinity of the stationary glass microsphere. its interaction with the
surface-bound myosin was monitored by casting the image of one of the latex
beads onto a 4-quadrant photo-detector. with the actin ®lament held taut but
in the absence of myosin binding, the r.m.s. amplitude of brownian motion is
given by kt=2ktrap 0:5 ,8:5 nm r.m.s. (where kt  thermal energy; ktrap 
optical tweezer stiffness  0:028 pn nm 2 1 ). when myosin binds to the actin
®lament the beads are restrained by an additional stiffness (kadd) which reduces
the r.m.s. amplitude of their motion to kt= 2ktrap  kadd 0:5 . brownian motion
shows a lorentzian power-density distribution with a roll-off frequency
f c  k=2pb,430 hz (where b  6phr; h  solution viscosity, r  bead
radius  0:55 mm).
to improve the time resolution with which the onset of attachments could be
detected we oscillated the position of one laser tweezer (at a frequency of
f  1 khz and r.m.s. amplitude, a0  90 nm) and monitored transmission of
this motion to the other bead. the combined effect of viscous damping and
series elastic elements9 caused the amplitude of the resultant right-hand-side
bead movement to be much smaller and to drop dramatically upon myosin
binding ar < a0 ktrap = k2tot  2b2pf 2 0:5 ; where ktot  2ktrap  kadd and
during myosin attachment kadd increases from zero to about 0.4 pn nm-1).
by oscillating the optical tweezer in this way it was possible to identify the start
and end of each skeletal muscle myosin attachment from the r.m.s. amplitude
of the 1 khz sine wave with a time resolution of ,1 ms.
to ensure that the records we obtained derive from single myosin heads, we
®rst made measurements at high surface densities of myosin and found that the
actin ®lament was translated by several hundred nanometres, often pulling the
beads completely out of the optical tweezers, under these conditions the bound
lifetime was very non-linear with [atp]. then the myosin surface density was
adjusted by diluting the myosin-containing solution such that single isolated
events with long intervening periods of free bead diffusion were observed. at
this surface density of myosin, about half of the stationary beads tested showed
no interactions with the actin ®lament (we could ®nd no active myosin on any
region of the bead). electron micrographs (not shown) showed that both myr-1
and bbm-1 deposited as monomers on nitrocellulose and did not clump or
dimerize on the surface. furthermore, the single extra step observed in the
myosin-i records could be readily identi®ed in about 80% of the events.
stiffness of the optical tweezers (ktrap) was calibrated by applying a large
amplitude triangular waveform displacement to the microscope stage (stage
velocity, v) and by measuring the resulting bead displacement (d) caused by
viscous drag force; giving ktrap  bv=d. the 4-quadrant photodetector was
calibrated by moving the trapped bead by a known amount using the laser
beam steering devices. the bandwidth of the 4-quadrant photodetector was

regulation of cell survival and cell death. the carboxy-terminal

traf-c domain2. here we report the crystal structure of the
traf domain of human traf2, both alone and in complex with a
peptide from tnf receptor-2 ( xxxg2301xxx ). the structures reveal a
trimeric self-association of the traf domain, which we con®rm
by studies in solution. the traf-c domain forms a new, eightstranded antiparallel b-sandwich structure. the  xxxg2301xxx  peptide
binds to a conserved shallow surface depression on one traf-c
domain and does not contact the other protomers of the trimer.
the nature of the interaction indicates that an sxxe motif may be
a traf2-binding consensus sequence. the trimeric structure of
the traf domain provides an avidity-based explanation for the
dependence of traf recruitment on the oligomerization of the
receptors by their trimeric extracellular ligands.
to understand the molecular basis of traf self-association and
receptor interaction, we determined the crystal structures of the
traf domain of human traf2, alone and in complex with a  xxxg2301xxx  peptide (fig. 1). we solved the structure of the peptide-free form
at 2.6 aê resolution by the multiple isomorphous replacement
method supplemented with six-fold non-crystallographic symmetry averaging. the re®ned structure at 2.2 aê resolution includes

residues 334±501 for each protomer of the two trimers in the
crystal. the structure in complex with the receptor peptide (4209qvpfskeec-4289; numbers marked by a prime symbol denote
receptor residues), which has been shown to interact with traf2
(refs 2, 3), was determined by molecular replacement and re®ned at
2.3 aê resolution. it includes residues 311±501 for one trimer and
residues 316±501 for the other trimer in the crystal. two receptor
peptides were visible for the ®rst trimer and crystal packing contacts
prevented peptide binding to the remaining four protomers, consistent with the expected low af®nity of the monomeric receptor
peptide. it is unlikely, however, that the observed peptide binding is
a crystallographic artefact as the two copies of the peptide make
essentially identical contacts with traf2.
each protomer of the traf2 trimer contains two domains
(fig. 1). as expected from sequence analysis, the coiled-coil
domain (up to residue 347) forms a single a-helix (an). residues
in this domain appear to be more ¯exible and exhibit higher average
temperature factors than residues in the other domain. the traf-c
domain, as identi®ed from sequence analysis (residues 352±501),
forms an eight-stranded antiparallel b-sandwich, with strands b1,

strands b2 and b7 each contain a b-bulge, which seems to have
important structural and biological functions (see below). a threeturn helix is present in the crossover connection between strands b1
and b2. preceding the b-sandwich, residues 348±350 form a parallel
b-structure (b0) with strand b2, immediately after the b-bulge in
this strand. the side chains of residues in b0 also partly cover one
edge of the b-sandwich. therefore, structural analysis suggests that
residue 348 should be the start of the traf-c domain, even though
residues 348±351 exhibit sequence variability. on the basis of visual
inspection of the scop structure database4 and an automatic
structural-similarity search using the dali program5, the traf-c
domain appears to represent a new fold for an eight-stranded antiparallel b-sandwich. however, the topology observed for this
domain may be reached by circular permutations of the b-strands
in copper±zinc superoxide dismutase (protein data bank entry
2sod)6 and the c2 domain from synaptotagmin i (pdb entry
isry)7.
the traf-domain trimer has the shape of a mushroom, with the
traf-c domain as the cap and the coiled-coil domain as the stalk
(fig. 1). the diameter of the mushroom cap ranges between 50 and
80 aê and a stalk containing ®ve heptad repeats is 50 aê in length
(residues 311±347). the parallel coiled-coil structure is formed by
the hydrophobic residues at positions a and d of the heptad repeats
(fig. 2) that are characteristic of coiled-coil structures8. the trimer
interface of the traf-c domain is formed by packing one end of
the b-sandwich (the b2±b3, b4±b5 and b6±b7 connections)
against an edge and a face of the b-sandwich (b0, b1 and b8
strands, b5±b6 and b7±b8 connections) of the neighbouring
protomer. most residues that participate in the formation of this
interface are rather hydrophobic (such as i355, y386, a420, l421

and f491). hydrophilic interactions are also observed at this trimer
interface, involving the side chains of k357, r385, r458 and  xxxd487xxx .
the amino-acid residues contributing to trimerization of the traf
domain are conserved among the traf-family members (fig. 2).
this sequence conservation indicates that other traf molecules
may be able to form similar homotrimers as well. formation of
heterotrimers, as has been shown for traf1 and traf2 (ref. 2),
may also be possible.
the trimeric self-association of traf2 was con®rmed by solution studies. size characteristization of a traf2 protein containing
residues 310±501 (relative molecular mass 22,600 (mr 22.6k)) by
equilibrium ultracentrifugation showed that it is a homogeneous
species of mr 63.3k. chemical crosslinking with glutaraldehyde
produced a single band on sds±polyacrylamide gels of approximate 65k. similar studies in conjunction with gel-®ltration analyses
showed that the traf-domain molecule containing residues 327±
501 was also trimeric. however, the traf domain containing
residues 342±501 was monomeric. these observations indicate
that the stability of the trimer may be dependent on both the
coiled-coil domain and the traf-c domain, in agreement with
earlier biological studies9. structurally, each traf-c domain alone
buries a surface area of roughly 640 aê2 upon trimerization; this
area is rather small compared with that produced by other stable
protein±protein interactions10. the results of the solution studies
indicate that a minimum of roughly three heptad repeats (residues
327±347), which produces an additional surface burial of 420 aê2,
may be required for trimer formation. the coiled-coil domain of
traf4 contains only three heptad repeats, the fewest of all the
trafs. in comparison, the coiled-coil domain of traf2 appears to
contain up to 14 heptad repeats.
each  xxxg2301xxx  peptide is bound symmetrically to a shallow surface
depression on the side of the mushroom-shaped trimer, extending
from the top to the bottom rim of the mushroom cap (figs 1, 3).
the peptide contacts only one traf domain, with no contacts to
the other two molecules of the trimer. this mode of interaction is
distinct from the interaction between tnf and the extracellular
domain of its receptor; each receptor binds near the interface
between neighbouring protomers in the tnf trimer11. we observed
no signi®cant conformational changes near the receptor-binding
sites or in the relative orientations of the protomers in the trimer
upon receptor binding, although there are conformational differences in several ¯exible regions of the traf domain.
the receptor peptide assumes a nearly extended main-chain
conformation in the complex (fig. 3). the receptor-binding site
in traf2 is formed by the exposed faces of strand b6 in the ®rst
sheet and strands b7, b4 and b3 in the second sheet. a portion of the
peptide chain (k4259±e4279) runs antiparallel and adjacent to the
latter half of strand b7 (residues 466±468), immediately after the bbulge in this strand. this leads to three main-chain hydrogen bonds
between the peptide and traf2, extending the four-stranded
second b-sheet by one strand. in addition, the main-chain amide
group of c4289 is within hydrogen-bonding distance of the carboxylate group of  xxxd399xxx  in traf2. the formation of a b-sheet has
been frequently observed in protein±peptide interactions, for
example in the interaction between substrates and certain serine

proteases12 and between peptides and the ptb and pdz domains13.
residues p4229±c4289 of the receptor peptide show interactions
with the traf2 protein (table 1, fig. 3), burying a surface area of
500 aê2 upon binding. residues q4209±v4219 are ordered in only
one copy of the peptide, where the peptide is stabilized by crystal
packing. it is likely that residues preceding p4229 do not contribute
to the binding. the peptide makes mostly van der waals contacts
with traf2, of which ,50% are polar±nonpolar contacts, 35% are
nonpolar±nonpolar contacts and 15% are polar±polar contacts.
residues between f4239 and c4289 appear to make signi®cant
contributions to the overall binding energy, as judged by the surface
area buried and the number of traf2 atoms in contact with these
residues (table 1). it remains to be seen whether residues following
c4289, which are not included in the receptor peptide used here, can
also contribute to binding. most of the receptor residues are bound
to shallow pockets on the surface of the traf-c domain and are
largely exposed to solvent, consistent with the expected low af®nity
of the interaction.
residues s4249 and e4279 of the receptor peptide appear to be
recognized speci®cally by traf2. the side chain of s4249 binds to a
small pocket on the surface of the protein and becomes completely
buried. the hydroxyl group of s4249 is within hydrogen-bonding
distance of the hydroxyl group of s467 (in strand b7) of traf2. the
sidechain carboxylate group of e4279 forms an ion pair with r393
(b3), and is also hydrogen-bonded to the side-chain hydroxyl of
y395 (b3). the aliphatic portion of the e4279 side chain is mainly
buried, leaving 13% surface exposure for the entire side chain. it
therefore appears that these two receptor residues are the major
determinants of binding speci®city, giving rise to an sxxe motif,
where x may be one of many amino-acid residues, preferably one
with a relatively large side chain. further support for the importance of this binding motif comes from the observation that the
main-chain hydrogen-bonding interactions between this peptide
and traf2 are also mediated through these residues. they are then
likely to serve as anchoring points during binding.
a homologous sequence from the receptor  xxxg2302xxx  (residues 576mlsveee-582), a member of the tnf-receptor superfamily, interacts with traf2 (ref. 3). the conservation of the sxxe motif in the
 xxxg2302xxx  receptor indicates that its binding to traf2 is likely to be the
same as observed here for the  xxxg2301xxx  peptide. in agreement with our
structural observations, single-point alanine mutagenesis of the  xxxg2302xxx 
peptide showed that residues l577±e581 each contributed to the
overall binding energy, as assessed by co-precipitation experiments3.
further mutagenesis and quantitative binding studies are needed to
determine more precisely the energetic contribution and the tolerance to mutations for each residue of the receptor peptide.
the three residues of traf2 (r393, y395 and s467) that
recognize the key residues in the sxxe motif of the receptor peptide
are strictly conserved among trafs 1, 2, 3 and 5 (fig. 2). in traf4,
the three residues are changed to serine, phenylalanine and phenylalanine, respectively. traf4 appears to be localized in the nucleus14
and has not yet been shown to interact with any receptors. in
traf6, r393 is conserved, whereas y395 and s467 are changed to
histidine and phenylalanine, respectively. the s467f change introduces a bulky phenyl ring on the surface, which may not allow the
receptor peptides to bind in the same way as observed here. it is not
clear from our structure why the  xxxg2301xxx  peptide binds only to
traf1 and traf2, and not to traf3, as shown by co-precipitation
experiments3. it is likely that this selectivity is caused indirectly by
sequence variations outside the binding site. one such possibility is
the v451p variation in traf3 (and in trafs 4±6; fig. 2), which
might change the local helical conformation observed in this
structure and therefore alter the positioning of several adjacent
residues involved in the peptide interaction (fig. 3). in a similar
way, adenylyl cyclase is activated by the g protein gsa rather than
gia, as revealed by crystallographic studies15.
traf proteins interact with several other linear sequences from
536

the intracellular domains of members of the tnf-receptor superfamily1. for example, a pxqx(t/s) traf-binding motif (where x
may represent any amino acid) has been identi®ed in  xxxg2302xxx , cd40,
cd27 and lmp-1 (ref. 1). stretches of conserved acidic residues
have also been shown to mediate the binding of the receptors 4-1bb
and ox40 to traf molecules16. in addition, traf6 may bind
to cd40 and the p75  xxxg259xxx  receptor through sequences
completely different from those described above17±19. whether these
diverse motifs bind to the sxxe site identi®ed here, perhaps also
exploiting b-edge hydrogen bonding, or to a different traf site,
remains to be determined by structural studies.
traf molecules are important mediators of signalling through

members of the tnf-receptor superfamily. the extracellular events
of this signalling process appear to involve the trimerization of the
extracellular domains of the receptor molecules by the inherently
trimeric ligands of the tnf superfamily. ligand-induced receptor
trimerization has been demonstrated by the co-crystal structure in
the interaction between tnf-b and  xxxg2300xxx  (ref. 11). the signi®cant sequence homology shared by the superfamily indicates the
conservation of this extracellular interaction. the trimerization of the
extracellular domains can bring the intracellular domains of the three
receptor molecules into proximity, which may then be recognized
optimally by the trimeric traf2 molecules. the avidity contribution
of this oligomeric interaction is expected to increase the af®nity
exponentially, providing an explanation for the ligand-induced
recruitment of traf proteins1,20. in addition to direct interactions
between receptors and trafs,  xxxg2300xxx  recruits traf2 indirectly
through the adapter protein tradd21. it remains to be demonstrated whether tradd is also trimeric and therefore relays the
avidity component of the interaction from the receptor to traf2.
the downstream events of traf-mediated signal transduction
are thought to involve the activation of map kinases and, ultimately, transcription factors of the rel and ap-1 family1. this
signalling process requires the amino-terminal ring and zinc®nger motifs of the traf molecules, although the detailed mechanisms of the process are largely unknown. our structures show
that the traf domain of traf2 may be a constitutive trimer
and binds the receptor peptide without signi®cant conformational
changes. this argues against receptor-induced traf oligomerization or conformational change as the initiator of downstream
events. however, such possibilities cannot be excluded on the
basis of our data, as full-length traf proteins may exist in a
different conformation in the unbound state. alternatively, the
recruitment of trafs to the cell membrane alone by the receptors
might be the determining factor in the signal transduction.

methods

protein preparation and crystallization. the complementary dna encoding

human traf2 was obtained from the library of expressed sequence tags. two
constructs of the traf domain of traf2 (residues 315±501 and residues 310±
501) containing carboxy-terminal  xxxd2282xxx  tags were generated using the
pet24d vector (novagen) and overexpressed in e. coli by induction at 20 8c.
the recombinant proteins were puri®ed by nickel-af®nity chromatography
(qiagen) followed by gel ®ltration (superose 12, amersham pharmacia). the
protein containing residues 315±501 was treated with trypsin at 4 8c for 2 h at
a 1:1,000 molar ratio, which removed residues 315±326. the digested protein
was further puri®ed and then crystallized at 20 8c from a solution containing
11% peg4000 and 0.1 m mes, ph 6.0. the crystals belong to space group c2
ê b  85:0 a,
ê c  124:1 aê and b  118:68.
with cell dimensions of a  134:9 a,
the protein containing residues 310±501 was crystallized from 12% peg4000
0.2 m ammonium acetate, and 0.1 m citrate, ph 5.6, in the presence of an equal
molar concentration (1 mm) of the peptide from  xxxg2301xxx  (residues 4209qvpfskeec-4289). the peptide was chemically synthesized with n-terminal
acetylation and c-terminal amidation to mimic the intact protein. the
estimated kd of the interaction (0.1±1.0 mm; preliminary results) indicates
that the binding sites may not be fully saturated under these crystallization
conditions. although similar crystals can be obtained in the absence of the
peptide, higher concentrations of the peptide prevented crystal growth,

indicating competition with crystal packing. the crystals belong to space
ê b  84:4 a,
ê c  100:7 aê and
group p21 with cell dimensions of a  83:0 a,
b  108:78. both crystal forms contain two trimers of the traf2 protein per
crystallographic asymmetric unit.
structure determination and analysis. all x-ray diffraction data (table 2)
were collected on cryoprotected crystals and processed with the hkl package22.
native and derivative data for the peptide-free crystals were measured on an raxis iv imaging plate system mounted on a rigaku ru300 rotating anode x-ray
generator. heavy-atom positions were located from the isomorphous differences by direct methods using shelx23; some of these positions were also
found by patterson interpretation using patsol24. mir phases were calculated
for re¯ections up to 2.6 aê resolution with the program phases25. after
solvent-¯attening, the phases were further improved by six-fold non-crystallographic symmetry (ncs) averaging with a locally written program (l.t.,
unpublished results). sequence ®tting and model building were done with
program o (ref. 26). a 2.2 aê data set collected using the ccd detector at the
chess f2 beamline was used for the crystallographic re®nement, with the
program cns27. ncs restraints were used throughout the re®nement. diffraction data of the peptide complex were collected at the x4a beamline of nsls.
the structure was determined by molecular-replacement calculations with the
program replace28 using the trimer atomic model from the peptide-free
structure and re®ned at 2.3 aê resolution using program cns27. an jf o j 2 jf c j
difference map clearly showed the electron densities for the bound peptides and
for the extra n-terminal residues. the coiled-coil region of the protein deviates
from non-crystallographic symmetry and ncs restraints were applied to the
traf-c domain alone. molecular surface representations and stick models
were produced with the program grasp29 and ribbon diagrams were generated
using the program setor30.
characterization of oligomerization in solution. equilibrium sedimentation
was done at 20 8c on protein samples at 25 mm concentration using an xl-a
optima analytical ultracentrifuge (beckman) running at 11,000 r.p.m. data
were ®t to a single species model. the apparent relative molecular mass was
calculated by assuming a partial speci®c volume of 0.74 ml g-1 and a solvent
density of 1.045 g  xxxg1167xxx . chemical crosslinking was done at room temperature
with 5 mm protein samples in the presence of an 8,000-fold molar excess of
glutaraldehyde. the reaction mixtures were quenched with excess glycine after
40-min incubations, concentrated using microcons (amicon) and separated by
sds±page.
