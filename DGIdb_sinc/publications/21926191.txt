 xxxd401xxx  (xl184), a novel  xxxg1398xxx  and  xxxg1274xxx  inhibitor, simultaneously suppresses metastasis, angiogenesis, and tumor growth.  the signaling pathway of the receptor  xxxg2198xxx   xxxg1398xxx  and its ligand  xxxg1044xxx  (hgf) is important for cell growth, survival, and motility and is functionally linked to the signaling pathway of vegf, which is widely recognized as a key effector in angiogenesis and cancer progression. dysregulation of the  xxxg1398xxx /vegf axis is found in a number of human malignancies and has been associated with tumorigenesis.  xxxd401xxx  (xl184) is a small-molecule kinase inhibitor with potent activity toward  xxxg1398xxx  and vegf receptor 2 ( xxxg1274xxx ), as well as a number of other receptor tyrosine kinases that have also been implicated in tumor pathobiology, including ret, kit, axl, and  xxxg801xxx . treatment with  xxxd401xxx  inhibited  xxxg1398xxx  and  xxxg1274xxx  phosphorylation in vitro and in tumor models in vivo and led to significant reductions in cell invasion in vitro. in mouse models,  xxxd401xxx  dramatically altered tumor pathology, resulting in decreased tumor and endothelial cell proliferation coupled with increased apoptosis and dose-dependent inhibition of tumor growth in breast, lung, and glioma tumor models. importantly, treatment with  xxxd401xxx  did not increase lung tumor burden in an experimental model of metastasis, which has been observed with inhibitors of vegf signaling that do not target  xxxg1398xxx . collectively, these data suggest that  xxxd401xxx  is a promising agent for inhibiting tumor angiogenesis and metastasis in cancers with dysregulated  xxxg1398xxx  and  xxxg1274xxx  signaling.
