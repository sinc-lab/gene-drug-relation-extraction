summary
 xxxd2422xxx , an imidazole anti-fungal
agent, has often produced features of androgen deficiency
including decreased libido, gynecomastia, impotence,
oligospermia, and decreased testosterone levels, in men
being treated for chronic mycotic infections. based on these
potent effects on gonadal function in vivo as well as previous
work in vitro demonstrating affinity of  xxxd2422xxx  for receptor proteins for glucocorticoids and l,25(oh)2vitamin
d3 and for sex steroid binding globulin (ssbg), the binding of  xxxd2422xxx  to human androgen receptors (ar) in
vitro was also examined.  xxxd2422xxx  competition with
[ h]methyltrienolone ( xxxd2631xxx ) for androgen binding sites
in dispersed, intact cultured human skin fibroblasts was determined at 22 °c. fifty percent displacement of
[ 3 h] xxxd2631xxx  binding to ar was achieved by 6.4+1.8
(se) x 10-5 m  xxxd2422xxx . additional binding studies
performed with  xxxd2422xxx  in the presence of increasing
amounts of [3h] xxxd2631xxx  showed that the interaction of  xxxd2422xxx  with ar was competitive when the data were analyzed by the scatchard method. it should be noted, however, that the dose of  xxxd2422xxx  required for 50% occupancy of the  xxxg183xxx  is not likely to be achieved
in vivo, at least in plasma. finally, androgen binding studies
performed with other imidazoles, such as  xxxd1732xxx ,  xxxd2640xxx , and fluconozole, revealed that in this class of
compounds only  xxxd2422xxx  appears to interact with the
 xxxg183xxx .
 xxxd2422xxx  appears to be the first example
of a non-steroidal compound which binds competitively to
both ssbg and multiple steroid hormone receptors, suggesting that the ligand binding sites of these proteins share
some features in common.
key words
 xxxd2422xxx  — androgen receptors — antiandrogen — skin fibroblasts

 xxxd2422xxx  is a synthetic imidazole with
anti-fungal properties. since it is effective when given orally, it
has become widely used for the treatment of a variety of fungal
infections, and has become the treatment of choice for both
mucocutaneous candidiasis and north american blastomycosis {dismukes, stamm, graybill, craven, stevens, stiller,
sarosi, medoff, gregg, gallis, fields, marier, kerkering, kaplowitz, cloud, bowles and shadomy 1983; bradsher, rice and
abernathy 1985). while therapeutic use of  xxxd2422xxx  has
been infrequently associated with serious side effects (except
in patients with previous liver disease), there have been several
reports of endocrine dysfunction including, adrenal insufficiency, especially with high dose therapy required in the treatment of life threatening systemic mycoses {pont, williams,
azher, reitz, bochra, smith and stevens 1982a; pont, williams, loose, feldman, reitz, bochra, smith and stevens 1982b;
pont, graybill, craven, galgiani, dismukes, reitz and stevens
1984). in men, signs of androgen deficiency, including
decreased libido, impotence, gynecomastia, and oligospermia, have been reported in association with the use of  xxxd2422xxx . since decreased testosterone levels have been found
in both patients and normal volunteers given  xxxd2422xxx , it
has generally been assumed that the signs and symptoms of
androgen deficiency are secondary to impaired testicular synthesis of testosterone {grosso, boyden, pamenter, johnson,
stevens and galgiani 1983; schurmeyer and nieschlag 1984;
sikka, swerdloff and rajfer 1985; kan, hirst and feldman
1985).
however, it is possible that the drug may be acting via other means of inducing androgen deficiency besides
inhibition of testosterone synthesis such as by increasing
androgen clearance, as might occur from alterations of testosterone binding to serum binding proteins, or by competition for
androgen binding sites on androgen receptors in target tissues.
it is possible, for instance, that binding of  xxxd2422xxx  to sex
steroid binding globulin (ssbg) could play a role in the
decreased testosterone levels observed in patients taking  xxxd2422xxx  chronically. in fact, grosso et al. (1983) have previously shown that  xxxd2422xxx  displaces steroid hormones
from serum transport proteins and, glass (1986) has shown
that one week administration of  xxxd2422xxx  stimulated a rise
in serum lh and fsh levels presumably due to the acute
lowering of serum testosterone levels.

ty in vivo could play a role in the pathogenesis of the hypogonadism observed with therapeutic administration of  xxxd2422xxx . in this study, the potential interaction of  xxxd2422xxx  with human androgen receptors was assessed by
using an established in vitro assay for measuring the binding of
radiolabeled androgens to the androgen binding sites present
in cultured human genital skin fibroblasts. the results indicate
that  xxxd2422xxx  possesses affinity for the human androgen
receptor protein.

determinations.

cell culture
fibroblast cultures were established from genital
skin specimens obtained from neonates at routine circumcision. the
specimens were finely minced in 60 mm petri dishes containing 4—5 ml
improved eagle's minimum essential medium (imem) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 10- 7 m insulin, collagenase (2
mg/ml), penicillin (100 u/ml), streptomycin (100 ug/ml), and glutamine (0.584 g/liter). this medium was freshly prepared for each
sample and filtered through a swinnex 13 milipore filter (millipore
corp., bedford, ma) immediately before use. after mincing, the mixtures were transferred to 25 cm2 tissue culture flasks and maintained in
the presence of 5 % co2 in a humidified incubator. after 24 h, the medium was changed to a growth medium consisting of imem supplemented with the additives listed above except collagenase. when colonies had grown to approximately 50% confluence (usually within 1 — 3
weeks), the cells were detached with 0.05% trypsin-0.02% edta in
pbs at 37 °c and passed serially into larger flasks (75 and 150 cm2).

whole cell [3hjr1881 binding assay
the binding of imidazoles to the  xxxg183xxx 
was determined by competitive displacement of [ h] xxxd2631xxx  from receptor sites in cultured human fibroblasts using a dispersed, intact cell
assay system as previously described (eil, lippman and loriaux 1980;
eil and edelson 1984). briefly,fibroblastswere grown to confluence in
five or six 150 cm tissue culture flasks for routine assay. this usually
required 4 - 6 weeks from the time of the initial seeding of the cell line.
all studies were performed between passages 3 — 20. two days before
assay, the medium was changed to one lacking fetal calf serum. this
was repeated again 24 hours before assay. the remainder of the procedure was as previously described (eil and edelson 1984), with the binding studies performed at 22 °c to minimize metabolism of the radioligand and competitors, except that [ h] xxxd2631xxx  was substituted for
ph]dht. competition assays were performed with 0.5 — 1.0 nm
[3h] xxxd2631xxx  and increasing amounts of the nonradioactive compounds.
binding to low affinity sites was determined in the presence of
5 x 10- 7 m  xxxd2631xxx  and was subtracted from whole cell binding of

human foreskin fibroblasts performed with increasing concentrations of [3h] xxxd2631xxx  in the absence (d), or presence ( • ) of
4 x 10- 5 m  xxxd2422xxx . the data points plotted are the mean
of duplicate determinations.

[3h] xxxd2631xxx  obtained in the absence of any inhibitor to assess binding to
5 high affinity sites. all compounds were dissolved in ethanol and
added in small aliquots to each tube. the ethanol was allowed to evaporate before addition of the cell suspension and the radioligand, both
of which were prepared in imem not containing serum or insulin. although the normal cell line used varied, standard amounts of unlabeled  xxxd2631xxx  (0.2, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0 and 500 nm) were included in each
assay as an internal control. the amount of  xxxd2631xxx  required for 50%
displacement of [3h] xxxd2631xxx  was 0.50 ± 0.08 (se) nm (5 assays), identical to the kd determined directly with increasing amounts of
[3h] xxxd2631xxx  (eil and edelson 1984). the percent binding of [3h] xxxd2631xxx 
in the absence of unlabelled hormone was 1.0—5.0%; binding to low
affinity sites was 5 -10 % of the total bound radioactivity. the number
of cells added per tube (0.5—2.0 x 10 ) determined these percentages.
individual data points were determined in duplicate. binding assays
with [ h]dexamethasone were performed in an analogous fashion.
results
binding of  xxxd2422xxx  to the  xxxg183xxx  was examined by determining the ability of increasing
amounts of the compound to displace [3h]r1881from the
androgen receptors in cultured human fibroblasts (figure 1).

while it is clear that  xxxd2422xxx  can interact with androgen
receptors in vitro, a concentration of 6.4+ 1.8 (se) x 10- m
(n = 3)  xxxd2422xxx  was required for 50% displacement of
the tracer from the  xxxg183xxx  in this system. similar results were obtained when the binding assay was performed at
37 °c. the relative binding activity of  xxxd2422xxx  for binding to the  xxxg183xxx  at 22 °c, calculated as the ratio of
the concentration of unlabelled  xxxd2631xxx  to the concentration of
 xxxd2422xxx  required for 50% displacement of the
[ 3 h] xxxd2631xxx  was 7.8 x 1 0 - 6 scatchard analysis of additional
binding studies performed with a fixed amount of  xxxd2422xxx  (4 x 10
m) and increasing concentrations of
[ hjr1881 indicates that  xxxd2422xxx  interacts with androgen receptors in a competitive fashion (figure 2). no displacement of [ h] xxxd2631xxx  occurred when other imidazole agents
used therapeutically —  xxxd1732xxx ,  xxxd2640xxx , and fluconazole — were tested in this assay system, at doses up to 4 x 10~ 4
m each (data not shown).
 xxxd2422xxx  also competed for [ h]dexamethasone binding to fibroblast glucocorticoid receptors
with a displacement curve parallel to unlabelled dexamethasone (results not shown). fifty percent inhibition of [ 3 h]dexamethasone binding was achieved by 3 x 1 0 - 4 m  xxxd2422xxx .
discussion
with the increasing use of  xxxd2422xxx  as an
oral fungicide, additional aspects of its clinical pharmacology
are becoming apparent (loose, kan, hirst, marcus and feldman 1983a; feldman 1986). due to the fact that  xxxd2422xxx 
is an inhibitor or cytochrome p450 enzyme systems (sikka,
swerdloff and rajfer 1985; sonino 1987), it is not surprising
that both adrenal and testicular steroidogenesis, each requiring multiple hydroxylation reactions, are inhibited both in
vitro and in vivo. however, the enzyme blockade in vivo must
only be partial, since patients on long-term therapy with conventional doses of  xxxd2422xxx  usually do not develop
adrenal insufficiency or hypogonadism, suggesting that the
pituitary is able to override the glandular dysfunctions by increasing acth and lh secretion. nonetheless, this inhibitory effect of  xxxd2422xxx  on steroidogenesis has been exploited clinically to treat successfully both acth and nonacth dependent hypercortisolism and gonadotropin-independent familial testotoxicosis (engelhardt, mann, hormann,
braun and karl 1983; shepard, hoffert, evans, emery and
trachtenberg 1985; sonino, boscaro, merola and mantero
1985; contreras, altieri, liberman, gac, rojas, ibarra,
ravanal and seron-ferre 1985; holland, fishman, bailey and
fazekas 1985).
based on observations by loose, stover and
feldman (1983b) that  xxxd2422xxx  binds to rat glucocorticoid
receptors and hackney and sch wartz (1988) that the drug competed for [ h jdexamethasone binding in a human leukemia
cell line, it is also possible that some of  xxxd2422xxx 's glucocorticoid antagonist activity may be occurring by virtue of
occupancy of  xxxg1601xxx  sites in target tissues.
we confirmed this observation by demonstrating  xxxd2422xxx 's inhibition of [3h]dexamethasone binding in dispersed
human skin fibroblasts. because certain drugs which induce
gynecomastia, such as cimetidine (hall 1976) and spironolac-

horm. metab. res. 24 (1992)
tone (loriaux, menard, taylor, pita and santen 1976; huffman, kampmann, hignite and azarnoff 1978), are believed to
have anti-androgenic properties on the basis of their ability to
interfere with androgen binding to its receptor (eil and edelson
1984),  xxxd2422xxx  was tested for this property as well. the
results of the studies reported here indicate that  xxxd2422xxx 
is a competitive inhibitor of the human fibroblast  xxxg183xxx , albeit with relatively weak affinity. its potency in this
regard is similar to that of cimetidine (eil and edelson 1984).
while the dose of  xxxd2422xxx  required for 50 % occupancy
of the  xxxg183xxx  is not likely to be achieved in vivo in
serum by routine anti-fungal therapy, it is possible that the
drug may be concentrated in target tissues, such as the breast,
allowing for sufficient levels to interact with the receptor. finally, individuals with diminished metabolic clearance of  xxxd2422xxx  might achieve particularly high serum levels of the
drug while on standard anti-fungal doses. since there are no
progesterone receptors in fibroblasts (eil, lippman and loriaux 1980), it is extremely unlikely that  xxxd2422xxx  is displacing [ 3 h]  xxxd2631xxx  from sites other than androgen receptors. finally, the data presented here do not distinguish between  xxxd2422xxx  being an  xxxg183xxx  antagonist or agonist.
this would require additional studies with bioassays.
it is interesting to note that, while these studies
were in progress, ayub and levell (1989) reported that  xxxd2422xxx  along with a number of other imidazole drugs had
little or no effect on [ 3 h]  xxxd2631xxx  binding to human prostate cytosol androgen receptors. the only possible explanation for
the discrepant results between the two studies regarding  xxxd2422xxx  is that the current assay is performed at 22 °c with intact cells, while the prostate receptor assay is performed at 4 °c
with cell extracts. under our conditions at the higher temperature it is conceivable that  xxxd2422xxx  is metabolized to a
compound with affinity for the  xxxg183xxx . additional
studies at 37 °c confirmed the observations of 22 °c. however, other studies have shown that  xxxd2422xxx  binds to
other receptors and serum binding proteins at 4 °c (grosso et
al. 1983; loose, stover and feldman 1983b; hodge, eil, degrange, liberman, marx and dunn 1984; hackney and
schwartz 1988; ayub and levell 1989). furthermore, previous
studies with numerous steroids and non-steroidal compounds
using the present assay have validated its accuracy and reliability (eil and edelson 1984). in any case, from the studies performed here it appears that  xxxd2422xxx 's interaction with the
 xxxg183xxx  is competitive and not artifactual.
the demonstration that  xxxd2422xxx  interacts
with glucocorticoid (loose, stover and feldman 1983; hackney and schwartz 1988; androgen, and also  xxxd408xxx  (hodge et al. 1984) receptors, as well as ssbg, suggests that the ligand binding sites of these proteins share some
features in common. on the other hand, recent work by svec
(1988) indicates that  xxxd2422xxx  may interact with the  xxxg1601xxx  at a site other than the agonist binding
site. the data shown in figure 2 indicate that, at least for the
 xxxg183xxx ,  xxxd2422xxx  appears to act as a competitive inhibitor, most likely at the ligand binding site. in either
case,  xxxd2422xxx , or other imidazole derivatives, may prove
useful in probing the structure and function of steroid and  xxxg2412xxx  proteins, especially now that the primary
amino acid sequences of most of these proteins are known.
