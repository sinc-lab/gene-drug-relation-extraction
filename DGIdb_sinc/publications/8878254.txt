(received january 8, 1996; accepted april 9, 1996)

 xxxd2421xxx  is a  xxxg1635xxx  agonist, available in scandinavia in a combined preparation ( xxxd2421xxx @), which contains  xxxd2421xxx  and the spasmolytical agent
3-dimethylamino-1,l-diphenylbutene(a29) in a one to five
ratio. a29 is chemically related to methadone and experiments in rats have shown that a29 potentiates the analgesic
effect of  xxxd2421xxx  (petersen 1951). we have recently
shown that  xxxd2421xxx  has lower binding affinity for the
total  xxxg1635xxx  than morphine. at &binding sites the two
opioids have equal affinity, whereas  xxxd2421xxx  has
much lower affinity than morphine to the k receptor (christensen 1993). the existence of two subtypes of mu receptors
has been suggested by pasternak and co-workers: a high
affinity, mul receptor subtype that appears to mediate supraspinal analgesia and a low affinity, mu2 subtype that appears to mediate spinal analgesia, respiratory depression
and inhibition of gastrointestinal motility (clark et al. 1988;
paul et al. 1989).
the purpose of the present study was to determine the
affinity of  xxxd2421xxx  for the mul and mu2 opioid receptor sites and to discover if  xxxd2421xxx  might be more
mul selective than morphine. secondly to determine if the
n-demethylated metabolite norketobemidone, and a29, the
spasmolytical compound of  xxxd2421xxx @might contribute to
the analgesic effect due to their affinities for the  xxxg1635xxx 
subtypes.
the opioid receptor binding was studied in a p2 fraction
from homogenate of bovine caudate nucleus. bovine nucleus caudatus was chosen for the binding studies of the
two mu subtypes because a previous study has shown that
this tissue has a high density of mu receptors (130 fmol/mg
protein) and relatively low density of delta receptors (48
fmol/mg protein) (christensen & reiff 1991).
bovine brains were placed on ice within minutes after the

death of the animal. the caudate nuclei were dissected out
within one hour and homogenized in 20 vol. of 0.32 m sucrose. the homogenate was centrifuged for 5 min. at
2,oooxg at 5"c, and the supernatant was recentrifuged for
10 min. at 30,oooxg. the pellet was resuspended in 10 vol.
of 0.05 m tris-hc1 buffer, ph 7.4 and stored at -80°c
until use.
for inhibition studies at the mul receptor site, binding
was characterized in the synaptic membrane fraction using
[3h][~-ala2,~-leu~]enkephalin
(dadle 0.7 nm) in the
(dpdpe 10 nm).
presence of [d-pen2, ~-pen~]enkephalin
the inclusion of dpdpe eliminates the delta labeling of
[3h]dadle, leaving only mul binding. for inhibition
studies at the mu2 receptor, binding was determined in the
synaptic membrane fraction using [3h][~-ala2,mephe4,
gly(01)~lenkephalin (dago 0.7 nm) in the presence of
[d-aia', ~-leu']enkephalin(dslet 5 nm). since [3h]dag o labels both mul and mu2 sites, dslet is included to
inhibit mul binding. in these mul and mu2 inhibition
studies the radioligands were incubated with 6-10 different
concentrations of either  xxxd2421xxx , norketobemidone
or a29 as previosly described (kristensen et al. 1995). in,
brief, the experiments were performed in a reaction mixture
(1 100 pl) containing 0.05 m  xxxd3449xxx , ph 7.4 and 5 mm
mgs04. incubations at 25°c were of 150 min duration. the
reaction was stopped by immersion into an ice bath and
subsequent filtration through whatman gf/b filters followed by washing of the filters with iced 0.05 m  xxxd3449xxx ,
ph 7.4. filters were shaken thoroughly in vials with 10 ml
filter counttm before [3h] counting. assays were performed in triplicate, and at least 4 experiments were done
for each competing drug at each receptor. ic50 values were
derived from the competition curves. ic50 is the concentration which inhibits 50 o/o of the specific binding of the
ligand. non specific binding was determined in the presence
of  xxxd2464xxx  (1 pm).
the results are presented in table 1. the icso values of
 xxxd2421xxx  at the mul and mu2 receptor were 5.0 and

and mu2 receptors than morphine, but the two opioids have
similar mul/mu2 affinity ratios. norketobemidone has high
affinity to the mul receptor, whereas a29 is practically without opioid activity.

9.5 nm, respectively, reflecting somewhat lower affinity than
that of morphine. however, the mul/mu2 affinity ratios for
 xxxd2421xxx  and morphine were similar. in our study on
the opioid receptor binding of methadone the icso values
were 5.7 and 10.0 nm, that is nearly the same as for  xxxd2421xxx  (kristensen et al. 1995).
norketobemidone had a high affinity for the mul receptor (icso=9.9 nm), suggesting an analgesic effect of this
metabolite. it has, however, not been possible to detect any
free unconjugated norketobemidone in plasma from three
patients after a daily oral dose of 90 mg of  xxxd2421xxx 
administered by the oral route (bondesson et al. 1983).
consequently the clinical relevance of our finding is open
to doubt.
the spasmolytical agent, a29 had very low affinity for
both mul and mu2 receptor sites and therefore probably
does not contribute to the opioid activity of  xxxd2421xxx @.
in summary,  xxxd2421xxx  has lower affinity to the mul
