interleukin-1 (il-1) inhibitors potentially have a role as antiinflammatory agents in refractory gout or
for patients who are unable to tolerate conventional therapy, such as nonsteroidal antiinflammatory
drugs (nsaids), colchicine, or glucocorticoids, for acute attacks. additionally, il-1 inhibitors may also
help patients with polyarticular and tophaceous gout by making them less vulnerable to breakthrough
attacks during initiation of chronic urate-lowering treatment, the mainstay of gout therapy. because
evidence highlights the role of proinflammatory cytokine il-1 in the inflammation process during an
acute gouty attack, il-1 inhibitors are used to modulate the pathogenesis of a variety of autoinflammatory diseases, providing support for its potential role in the inflammatory process of gout. after
nsaids, colchicine, and steroids, il-1 inhibitors are beneficial as fourth-line therapy for acute gout
attacks due to their high cost and limited clinical experience. the il-1 inhibitors used in gout are anakinra,  xxxd414xxx , and  xxxd3120xxx . based on published evidence, anakinra has limited support in the
form of anecdotal case reports to justify its use for treating gout.  xxxd414xxx ’s toxic profile in clinical trials precludes its use in treating patients for gout, and  xxxd3120xxx  shows promise with a few welldesigned studies to support its use in gout patients initiating urate-lowering treatment. when combined with current traditional therapies, these newer agents present clinicians and patients with more
potential treatment options in the difficult-to-treat gout population.

management of gout remains challenging
despite the existence of several treatment
options. patients with poorly controlled gout
can experience tremendous challenges and disease burden including uncontrolled pain and
physical limitations, resulting in poor quality of
life.1 gout, as a primary diagnosis, accounted

2006 and more than 1 million hospitalizations
in 2007.2 in addition, patients who experience
gout with comorbidities incur higher goutrelated costs compared with those without
comorbidities.3 private consulting groups estimate that nearly 120,000 americans experience
refractory gout out of 8 million people with
gout.4 interleukin-1 (il-1) inhibitors potentially
have a role in the treatment of refractory gout or
for those who are unable to tolerate conventional therapy, such as nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (nsaids), colchicine, or
glucocorticoids, for acute attacks.5 although the

interleukin-1 inhibitors for gout tran et al
current il-1 inhibitors—anakinra,  xxxd414xxx ,
and  xxxd3120xxx —do not have u.s. food and
drug administration (fda) approval for the
treatment or prophylaxis of acute gout, they are
being used off label for these indications.5 the
mechanism behind these agents lies in the interruption of the inflammatory cascade associated
with the monosodium urate (msu) crystals in
gouty joints.6 large-scale studies with these
investigational drugs will further delineate recommendations for their use in various gout conditions. in this review, we examine the current
data for il-1 inhibitors in the treatment of
refractory acute gout, prophylaxis of gout flare
(gf) with urate-lowering therapy, and refractory
gout in patients intolerant to other therapies.
overview of gout
gout is characterized by severe pain and
inflammation of affected joints, leading to a
decreased quality of life and productivity.7 uric
acid may accumulate in the serum as a result of
production and intake of dietary purines,
decreased  xxxd3472xxx  excretion by the kidneys,
and urate produced by purines.8 after serum
 xxxd3472xxx  exceeds urate solubility, msu crystals
develop. the four clinical stages of gout include
asymptomatic hyperuricemia, acute gout, intercritical or interval gout, and chronic tophaceous
gout.9 gout diagnosis is based on the presence of
msu crystals in synovial fluid or tophus detected
by polarized light microscopy. alternatively, the
american college of rheumatology (acr) criteria to diagnose acute gout are the presence of at
least six of the following findings: asymmetric
swelling within a joint on a radiograph, first metatarsophalangeal joint is tender or swollen,
hyperuricemia, maximal inflammation developed
within 1 day, monoarthritis attack, more than
one acute arthritis attack, redness observed over
joints, subcortical cysts without erosions on a
radiograph, suspected tophi, synovial fluid culture negative for organisms during an acute
attack, unilateral first metatarsophalangeal joint
attack, or unilateral tarsal joint attack.9, 10
hyperuricemia is typically characterized as uric
acid levels greater than 7.0 mg/dl and 6.0 mg/dl
in men and women, respectively.10 currently,
individuals with asymptomatic hyperuricemia do
not require drug therapy. high  xxxd3472xxx  levels,
however, have been investigated, with limited
evidence, as a possible marker for predicting coronary heart disease and thus may be a target in
the future to reduce cardiovascular risk.11 gout

745

therapy consists of treating acute attacks, reducing serum uric levels to 6 mg/dl or less, and providing prophylaxis against flares in addition to
modifying risk factors.9, 12
although several drug therapies are available
for the clinical management of gout, 69% of
patients have at least one recurrent acute episode per year.12 initial attacks may resolve in 1–
2 weeks without therapy; however, recurrent
acute attacks may be prolonged and need treatment for full resolution.9 the acr recommends
pharmacologic treatment with nsaids, systemic
corticosteroids, or oral colchicine within
24 hours of onset of an acute attack.13 appropriate monotherapy selection should be based on
patient-specific factors. patients with an inadequate response to therapy may be switched to an
alternative agent or may benefit from combination therapy with two of the therapies just cited.
antiinflammatory prophylaxis of gout attacks is
recommended first line with low-dose colchicine
or nsaids, respectively, or second line with
corticosteroids.13
rapid initiation of a fast-acting, high-dose
nsaid is appropriate monotherapy for patients
without contraindications to nsaids suffering
an acute gout attack.9, 13 all nsaids, including
 xxxg1884xxx  inhibitors, are equally effective
in treatment. nsaids are notorious for causing
adverse effects such as bleeding, elevated blood
pressure, renal dysfunction, and increased risk
of cardiovascular disease; therefore, patients
with comorbidities such as peptic ulcers, renal
dysfunction, heart disease, or uncompensated
congestive heart failure may be unable to tolerate their use. although treatment with celecoxib
may be beneficial in populations with gastrointestinal contraindications or nsaid intolerance,
its risk-versus-benefit ratio has not been clearly
defined.14 the acr recommends the full fdaapproved nsaid dose for acute attack treatment;
however, patients with comorbidities may benefit from dose reduction.13
colchicine is an effective treatment for gout
when the onset of the acute attack is within
36 hours of treatment initiation, with maximal
benefit if onset is within 24 hours.13 studies of
the fda-approved branded generic colchicine
( xxxd1740xxx ; takeda pharmaceuticals america, inc.,
deerfield, il) have shown that a lower dose of
colchicine is as effective as higher doses, with
less gastrointestinal toxicity.15 the recommended
dose for the treatment of gout flares is 1.2 mg at
the first sign of a gout attack followed by 0.6 mg
1 hour later; subsequent prophylaxis with

interleukin-1 inhibitors for gout tran et al
flares can lead to long-term complications
including urolithiasis, joint destruction, and
chronic tophaceous gout.16 chronic management with uricosuric, uricostatic, or uricolytic
drug therapies are used to prolong the intercritical gout phase and decrease the prospect and
complications associated with continuous
flares.18 the mechanism of il-1 inhibitors in
gout does not lower serum  xxxd3472xxx  levels; thus
il-1 inhibitors should generally be considered as
an addition to urate-lowering therapy.
literature search
we conducted a literature search of the pubmed-medline database over a 12-year time span
(january 2000–july 2012) to identify clinical trials, retrospective studies, and case reports related
to il-1 inhibitor use in patients with gout. the
search was limited to studies in adult humans
(18 years or older) and english-language articles.
bibliographies of the articles were also reviewed
for pertinent studies performed during the specified time frame. search terms were gout, interleukin-1 inhibitors, interleukin-1 receptor antagonists,
 xxxd414xxx ,  xxxd3120xxx , and anakinra. trials
evaluating il-1 inhibitors alone or in combination with other pharmacologic or nonpharmacologic treatments were used. all dosages of il-1
inhibitors were included. gout diagnosis for clinical trials was accepted if patients met the published criteria set by the acr outlining items for
the clinical diagnosis of acute gout or if they had
msu crystals present in synovial fluid or if
tophus was detected by polarized light microscopy.9, 10 most anakinra data in gout were
derived from case studies; thus we included case
studies if gout diagnosis was determined by the
treating physician because acr criteria were not
always available or described in the reports.
clinical trials
anakinra
anakinra is a human  xxxd2806xxx 
approved by the fda in 2001 for the treatment
of moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis. the
agent has also had some success being used off
label in the treatment and prevention of acute
gout.6, 25–27
a case report studied the use of anakinra in
acute on chronic gout.25 the patient was a 74year-old man who presented with a gf in multiple joints. his medical history was positive for

747

membranous glomerulonephritis, and incidentally he was taking prednisolone 5 mg once/day.
in addition, the patient had hypertension, ischemic heart disease, and a creatinine clearance of
54 ml/min. he had a previous anaphylactic reaction with allopurinol and was unable to take
nsaids due to renal dysfunction. he was only
able to take up to 0.5 mg of colchicine and 1 g
of probenecid once/day, and symptoms were
exacerbated with steroid tapering. the patient
received anakinra 100 mg once/day subcutaneously and was still receiving treatment at
6 months. his global assessment tool score
decreased from 65 mm to 20 mm on a 100point visual analog scale (vas) after 2 weeks of
anakinra. the authors did not report any
adverse effects.
in another case study, anakinra was used in
the treatment of acute gout.28 the patient was a
54-year-old man with a medical history of
hypertension, hashimoto thyroiditis, and type 2
diabetes mellitus who had multiple gfs that
required multiple hospitalizations. the patient
had a stevens–johnson syndrome reaction from
allopurinol, probenecid was not an option due
to renal function, and colchicine and nsaids
had little efficacy. the patient was taking prednisone, titrated as high as 100 mg once/day,
with significant adverse effects and minimal
relief from his gout. anakinra was initiated at
100 mg subcutaneously 3 times/week, and
although effective, it was titrated up to 4 times/
week due to breakthrough flares he experienced
toward the end of each week. the patient was
still receiving this regimen 8 months later and
was able to wean his prednisone use significantly to 7.5 mg once/day, with a plan to discontinue the steroid. no adverse effects were
reported. a steroid-sparing effect with anakinra
use has also been demonstrated by others.20
a case report of a 32-year-old man who failed
allopurinol and colchicine received 3 doses/day
of anakinra 100 mg.29 pain relief was seen
within 48 hours; however, flulike symptoms presented 24 hours after the first dose. h1n1 influenza virus was confirmed by polymerase chain
reaction, although anakinra was unlikely the
cause because it had been administered during
the incubation period. the infection resolved
with no complications, and anakinra was
restarted once/week with no other reported
adverse effects.
an open-label pilot study was conducted in a
sample of 10 patients evaluating the effect of
anakinra on acute gouty arthritis.6 there was at

748

pharmacotherapy volume 33, number 7, 2013

least a 1-month follow up. all patients had either
ineffective responses to nsaids, colchicine, or
glucocorticoids or had previously documented
significant adverse effects from these agents.
exclusion criteria were creatinine clearance less
than 30 ml/min, active infections, and uncontrolled diabetes or heart failure. cultures were
performed by aspiration to rule out infection in
joints that were affected. subjects received anakinra 100 mg once/day for 3 days administered
subcutaneously. according to patient assessments, pain improved in all patients within 24–
48 hours, with ranges of 50–100% improvement.
joints were clinically assessed, and 90% of
patients had complete resolution by day 3. no
adverse reactions were reported.
in contrast, a retrospective analysis of 10
patients who had received an average dose of
anakinra 100 mg once/day showed less favorable
results.30 six patients reported complete resolution of symptoms, one patient with a partial
response, and three with no response. relapses
occurred in 90% of patients within 3–45 days.
there was one report of injection site reaction.
nsaids were avoided because most of the
patients had renal insufficiency. all patients had
received methylprednisolone or prednisone to
control gfs before the use of anakinra. seven
patients were receiving colchicine prophylaxis
0.6 mg every other day or 0.6 mg once/day, and
eight patients were taking allopurinol at the time
of gf. increased doses of colchicine for gf were
not used in any of the patients.
anakinra is supplied as 0.67-ml prefilled glass
syringes, each containing 100 mg of drug.26 it is
recommended to decrease the dosing frequency
to every other day in patients with creatinine
clearances less than 30 ml/min, including endstage renal disease.27 hypersensitivity to products developed from escherichia coli would preclude the use of anakinra.26 reported adverse
events (aes) primarily consist of infections,
malignancy, neutropenia, injection site reactions,
gastrointestinal complaints, and cardiorespiratory arrest.26
there may be a role for anakinra in patients
who are refractory to other treatments of acute
gout based on the available literature. randomized controlled trials with head-to-head comparisons to conventional treatment are necessary to
further elucidate anakinra’s place in treatment.
inclusion of patients with renal and heart disease would also shed valuable insight on this
group. duration of treatment and longer followup to reveal any potential unknown adverse

effects would have great utility. anakinra currently has limited data to justify its use for treating gout given that it only has anecdotal case
reports for evidence. at this time, anakinra cannot be recommended as standard therapy for the
treatment of acute gfs due to the lack of available robust literature.
 xxxd414xxx 
 xxxd414xxx  is a fully humanized immunoglobulin g1j monoclonal antibody that binds
selectively to the human il-1b receptor.31 this
inhibits the crystal-induced transduction of the
endogenous il-1b signaling pathway.32  xxxd414xxx  is currently approved for the chronic
treatment of hereditary autoinflammatory  xxxg1567xxx -associated periodic syndrome (caps) at a
dosage of 150 mg administered subcutaneously
every 8 weeks.33, 34  xxxd414xxx  differs from
other il-1b inhibitors due to its selective affinity
for il-1b receptor and a long half-life of 21–
28 days.34
in a multicenter, single-blind dose-finding
study 143 patients with acute gout attack not
relieved by or who had contraindications to
nsaids were randomized to receive a single
subcutaneous dose of  xxxd414xxx  10, 20, 25,
50, 90 or 150 mg or  xxxd3418xxx 
40 mg intramuscularly.35 the acr guidelines
recommend  xxxd3418xxx  60 mg
intramuscularly; thus the low dose used in this
study may have favored canakimumab.13  xxxd414xxx  150 mg was superior in pain reduction
at all measured time intervals (6, 12, 24, and
72 hours and 4, 5, 6, and 7 days after treatment)
compared with  xxxd3418xxx .  xxxd414xxx  was also associated with a reduction in
the occurrence of acute flares (3.7% vs 45%,
p≤0.01) at 8 weeks. the overall rate of aes was
similar in both treatment groups including the
rate of infectious aes ( xxxd414xxx  150 mg
2.8% vs  xxxd3418xxx  3.5%).
 xxxd414xxx  150 mg administered subcutaneously was further studied in two phase iii randomized clinical trials: response in acute flare
and in prevention of episodes of re-flare in
gout (b-relieved and b-relieved ii).36
these were 12-week multicenter, active control,
double-dummy studies with a 12-week doubleblind extension study. b-relieved (n=230)
was
conducted
primarily
in
europe,
whereas b-relieved ii was conducted primarily in the united states (n=226). the purpose of
the extension studies was to determine the

interleukin-1 inhibitors for gout tran et al
long-term safety and tolerability of subcutaneous
 xxxd414xxx . a total of 456 patients with a history of three or more flares within the last year,
a baseline pain intensity of 50 mm or higher on
a 100-point vas, and a contraindication, intolerance, or unresponsiveness to nsaids or colchicine were enrolled in the two studies. patients
received  xxxd414xxx  150 mg or triamcinolone
acetonide 40 mg intramuscularly within the first
5 days of the acute gf onset. patients were
allowed to receive rescue medications for uncontrolled pain during the initial acute flare or a
repeat dose of the study drug after 14 days of
the original dose administered. pain was
recorded at the most affected joint by the
patients at baseline and subsequently at 6, 12,
24, 48, and 72 hours and 4, 5, 6, and 7 days
after treatment. all pain assessments were made
using the 0- to 100-mm vas score.
 xxxd414xxx  was superior for both coprimary end points, with lower mean vas pain
scores at 72 hours (25 mm vs 35.7 mm, p<0.01)
and a lower rate of acute flares during the first
12 weeks (16% vs 35.8%, p<0.01, odds ratio
0.34). the difference between mean pain scores
at 72 hours was 10.7 mm (95% confidence
interval [ci] 15.4 to 6.0 mm, p<0.01). this
difference remained significant until day 7 of the
study, with a net difference of 7.3 mm (95%
ci
11.6 to
2.9 mm, p<0.01). overall, a
higher rate of aes and serious aes were
reported in the  xxxd414xxx  arm than in the
 xxxd3418xxx  arm: 66.2% versus
52.8% and 5.8% versus 4.4%, respectively. serious aes reported in the  xxxd414xxx  arm
included arrhythmias, myocardial ischemia,
renal artery occlusion, and chronic renal failure.
infectious aes were reported in 20.4% of
patients in the  xxxd414xxx  arm versus 12.2%
of patients in the triamcinolone arm. serious
infections including abscess, pneumonia, and
gastroenteritis were reported in 1.8% of  xxxd414xxx -treated patients versus 0% of the
patients in the triamcinolone arm.
the efficacy of  xxxd414xxx  for prophylaxis
against acute gouty arthritis during initiation of
urate-lowering therapy (allopurinol) was tested
in a 24-week randomized, dose-ranging study.
patients initiated on allopurinol 100–300 mg
once/day were randomized to receive a single
dose of  xxxd414xxx  at varying doses of 25, 50,
100, 200, or 300 mg subcutaneously, four doses
of  xxxd414xxx  (2 doses at 50 mg then 2 doses
at 25 mg) administered every 4 weeks, or colchicine 0.5 mg once/day for 16 weeks. the

749

investigators were unable to determine equivalent efficacy of  xxxd414xxx  compared with colchicine based on the mean number of flares,
which was the primary outcome of the study.
the proportion of patients experiencing at least
one flare during the first 16 weeks of therapy
was lower for all  xxxd414xxx  treatment groups
(15% vs 27%, p≤0.05). additionally, there was a
64–72% risk reduction in mean number of
flares/patient for patients who received  xxxd414xxx  50 mg or more (hazard ratio 0.28–
0.36, p<0.05). serious aes were reported in a
higher proportion of  xxxd414xxx -treated
patients than colchicine-treated patients: 43%
versus 5.6%. infections were reported in 1.2% of
colchicine-treated patients versus none of the
patients receiving  xxxd414xxx . further trials of
 xxxd414xxx  150 mg are being conducted to
determine its efficacy in the prevention of acute
gouty attacks.17
 xxxd414xxx  is available as 150 mg of powder for solution for injection in a vial with a
stopper and flip-off cap to be reconstituted with
1.0 ml of water for injection.34 the manufacturer recommends no dosage adjustments in
patients with renal impairment,34 albeit limited
data with  xxxd414xxx  are available in this population. all patients must be tested for both
active and latent tuberculosis infection before
beginning  xxxd414xxx  therapy.35 patients
receiving  xxxd414xxx  should also be monitored
for infections and slight elevations of serum
transaminase or bilirubin levels.34
 xxxd414xxx  did not receive fda approval
in 2011 for the treatment of gouty arthritis
attacks in patients who cannot obtain adequate
response with nsaids or colchicine after the
completion of its phase iii clinical trial.37 in
june 2011, the fda advisory committee recommended against approval, citing increased rates
of infection, high triglyceride levels, and elevated  xxxd3472xxx  levels in the blood seen in the
drug’s clinical trials for gout and rheumatoid
arthritis.37 novartis (the manufacturer of  xxxd414xxx ) had previously dropped efforts to win
approval for the indication of rheumatoid arthritis. although it is associated with symptomatic
improvement of acute gout attacks, due to risks
of serious adverse events associated with its
administration, additional safety data have been
requested before it can be approved for use in
this patient population.  xxxd414xxx  may have
a role for prophylaxis in acute gouty attacks due
to a smaller dose required for desired effect.
further studies are needed before its role for

acute prophylaxis can be determined. based on
the available evidence for use of  xxxd414xxx  in
acute gout, clinicians should be advised against
the off-label use at this time.
 xxxd3120xxx 
in november 2011,  xxxd3120xxx  was accepted
for fda review in the prevention of gfs in
patients initiating  xxxd3472xxx –lowering therapy.
 xxxd3120xxx ’s first approved indication was in
2008 for children 12 years and older with autoinflammatory caps. in adults with caps,  xxxd3120xxx  is given as a loading dose of 320 mg,
delivered as two subcutaneous injections of
160 mg each given on the same day at two different sites, and continued thereafter as a once/
week 160-mg injection.19 also known as il-1
trap,  xxxd3120xxx  is a fusion protein of the soluble il-1 receptor and fragment crystallizable
portion of human immunoglobulin that blocks
 xxxg1169xxx  and il-1b from binding to receptors.38
the safety of  xxxd3120xxx  was investigated in a
proof-of-concept study involving 10 patients
with chronic gout for at least 6 months with one
or more gout-inflamed joints for 4 weeks or
longer.39 the multicenter, nonrandomized, single-blind, crossover study found that patients
with chronic active gouty arthritis receiving  xxxd3120xxx  320 mg subcutaneously followed by
160 mg once/week for 5 subsequent weeks tolerated the drug, with no deaths or serious aes.
the study detected a reduction in self-reported
pain using a 10-point vas with  xxxd3120xxx  after
2 weeks (from 5.0 to 2.8, p<0.049) and sustained improvement at the end of 6 weeks (1.3,
p<0.049). one patient withdrew due to injection
site reactions, which was the most common ae
in the study. three patients developed nonneutralizing antibodies to  xxxd3120xxx , although nonneutralizing antibodies were not associated with
any measured untoward effects.  xxxg520xxx  concentrations were noted to be reduced. at
the end of the study, 6 of 10 patients reported
greater than 50% improvement in pain
(p=0.00015), and half had more than 75%
improvement (p≤0.01).
 xxxd3120xxx  was studied in a phase ii doubleblind randomized trial conducted in the united
states involving 83 adults with serum urate concentrations 7.5 mg/dl or higher and two or more
gout attacks per year while treated with allopurinol that was titrated for serum urate levels less
than 6 mg/dl.38 patients were randomly assigned
to gf prophylaxis with a  xxxd3120xxx  320-mg

loading dose followed by 160 mg subcutaneously once/week or placebo. patients with acute
attacks were given nsaids or prednisone. during the 12-week trial, 33 gfs (79%) occurred in
42 patients given placebo versus 6 (15%) in 41
patients given  xxxd3120xxx  (p=0.0011), with a significant difference in gfs occurring by week 4
(p=0.007). of patients receiving placebo, 45.2%
had gfs, and of those, 21.4% had more than
one flare. only 14.6% receiving  xxxd3120xxx  had
flares, and none of them had more than one
flare. aes were similar between placebo- and  xxxd3120xxx -treated patients and were not serious.
infection was the most common ae (26.2% for
placebo and 14.6% for  xxxd3120xxx ). more  xxxd3120xxx -treated patients completed the primary
12-week evaluation period compared with placebo (98% vs 79%, p=0.015). according to the
acr, “pharmacologic antiinflammatory prophylaxis is recommended for all gout patients when
pharmacologic urate lowering is initiated, and
should be continued if there is any clinical evidence of continuing gout disease activity and/or
the serum urate target has not yet been
achieved.”40 thus the appropriateness of these
placebo-controlled trials with  xxxd3120xxx  could
be questioned.
the preventative study against urate-lowering drug-induced gout exacerbations (presurge-1) trial is a north american phase iii
randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled
trial evaluating efficacy and safety of two dose
levels of  xxxd3120xxx  for gf prevention during ini-

interleukin-1 inhibitors for gout tran et al
160 mg [p=0.0001 vs placebo], 8.8% with
 xxxd3120xxx  80 mg [p=0.0635 vs placebo], and
1.3% with placebo) based on a post-hoc analysis.
multinational extension studies evaluating  xxxd3120xxx  for the prevention of gout are currently
under way, and their results will be considered
by the fda to approve  xxxd3120xxx  for use in gf
prevention.
 xxxd3120xxx  is supplied as a sterile single-use
20-ml glass vial containing 220 mg of  xxxd3120xxx 
as a lyophilized powder for reconstitution only
for subcutaneous injection.19 the pharmacokinetics of  xxxd3120xxx  administered subcutaneously
in patients with renal or hepatic impairment have
not been studied; thus no dose adjustment recommendations in these patient populations are
available. the most common adverse reactions
reported are injection site reactions and upper
respiratory tract infections, although alterations
in lipid profiles have been noted.19 elevations of
total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and triglyceride levels of 19 mg/dl, 2 mg/dl, 10 mg/dl,
and 57 mg/dl, respectively, were reported after
6 weeks of  xxxd3120xxx  therapy.19 thus regular
lipid panel checks should be performed. live
vaccines should not be given to patients receiving  xxxd3120xxx  because the risk of secondary
transmission of infection by live vaccines cannot
be ruled out in patients receiving  xxxd3120xxx .19
in may 2012, the fda denied approval of the
application for use of  xxxd3120xxx  in the prevention
of gf in patients initiating  xxxd3472xxx –lowering
therapy, citing the need for additional clinical
data.42 the fda advisory committee acknowledged there is modest treatment effect for the
use of  xxxd3120xxx  to prevent gfs but preferred
that the trials be limited to patients with gout
who are unable to tolerate or are refractory to
nsaids and/or colchicine, patients with more
severe forms of gout, or patients with decreased
renal function.42 the fda also recommended

that the investigators extend the evaluation of
 xxxd3120xxx  to studies beyond 16 weeks because
treatment with  xxxd3120xxx  in patients with more
severe forms of gout would likely exceed
4 months. additional safety issues raised by the
fda include the need for more thorough investigations of malignancy risk because the trials
may have been underpowered or of insufficient
duration to detect a possible imbalance in this
risk, and that infection may be a concern, particularly in patients receiving concomitant steroids.
pending additional efficacy and long-term safety
studies, at this time,  xxxd3120xxx  cannot be recommended as an alternative therapy for difficultto-treat gout patients refractory to conventional
therapies. the fda did emphasize that a role
for il-1 inhibitors does exist for the treatment of
gout.
drug adherence in patients with gout
proper management of gout will help reduce
health care costs, reduce emergency department
visits, and improve medication adherence and
patients’ quality of life.43–45 drug nonadherence
continues to be a major factor that contributes
to the poor management of gout in many
patients.1, 46, 47 of special note, during the early
months of urate-lowering therapy, urate deposits
can release crystals, leading to an increase in
gout attacks. adherence to urate-lowering therapy can be compromised if precipitated gout
attacks cause severe pain and inflammation. the
most recent studies of  xxxd3120xxx  have focused
on individuals’ initiating urate-lowering therapy,
suggesting that a role for these agents may be
particularly beneficial in people at highest risk
of nonadherence to the mainstay treatment of
gout with urate-lowering medications.
in addition, clinicians must incorporate the
potential implications of involving such expensive biologic agents as short-term use options for

recurrent gout, with the humane impact these
therapies may have on patients’ quality of life.
due to the relative high costs of il-1 inhibitors,
they are unlikely to be covered by insurance for
most people unless convincing evidence shows
they have failed all other options. table 1 lists
the average wholesale prices of these agents.48
conclusion
il-1 inhibitors have potential as an option for
managing gout in patients who are unable to tolerate traditional medications or initiating uratelowering therapies. with growing literature
designed to measure the impact of il-1 inhibitors, caution is advised in interpreting trial
results that may not include well-studied treatment for patients in a control group. although
evidence is still emerging regarding the role of
il-1 inhibitors in the management of acute gout
and gf prophylaxis, these agents may represent
an opportunity for patients to experience less
pain, decreased acute attacks, and improved
adherence to urate-lowering therapy, as well as
their long-term benefits, which must be weighed
against the high costs of these new biologic
agents. il-1 inhibitors should be considered as
fourth-line therapy after nsaids, colchicine, and
steroids due to their high costs and limited clinical experience. among the il-1 inhibitors, anakinra has limited data, predominantly from
anecdotal case reports, to justify its use in treating gout.  xxxd414xxx ’s toxic profile precludes
its use in treating gout.  xxxd3120xxx  shows promise with a few well-designed studies to support
its use, although the fda has requested more
studies in specifically targeted difficult-to-treat
populations with longer study durations. when
combined with current traditional therapies,
these newer agents present clinicians and
patients with a broader scope for more treatment
options in the difficult-to-treat gout population.
