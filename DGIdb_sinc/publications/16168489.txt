abstract
in the last few years, major advancement has been made in the understanding of the genetic basis of inherited arrhythmogenic diseases.
interestingly, the information obtained with the application of molecular genetics to these diseases is now influencing their clinical
management, allowing gene-specific risk stratification and gene-specific management.
the first attempt for a gene-specific therapy was made in 1995 with the use of  xxxd2635xxx  in long-qt syndrome (lqts) patients with
mutations in the  xxxg2028xxx  gene. since then, several investigators have proposed novel therapeutic approaches based on the identification of the
functional consequences of genetic mutations. in some instances, these novel therapies have already been introduced in clinical practice, and
data are being collected to establish their long-term efficacy. in this review, we will summarize the current understanding of the molecular
bases of inherited arrhythmias, with a specific focus toward discussing the most recent advancements toward the development of genespecific therapies.

1. introduction
cardiac channellopathies are genetic disorders that are
caused by dna mutations of proteins involved in the
control of cardiac excitability. the clinical manifestations of
these disorders range from distinguishing electrocardiographic patterns to life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias.
multiple genes and allelic variants of channellopathies have
been discovered in the last decade (http://pc4.fsm.it:81/
cardmoc), and genetics is now emerging as an important
tool contributing not only to a better diagnosis but also to
risk stratification and management of patients.
the growing understanding of the pathophysiology of
cardiac ion channel diseases has highlighted a high degree of
genetic heterogeneity and results of genotype–phenotype
correlation studies have unveiled the distinguishing features
of each genetic variant. as a practical consequence for each
disease, there are multiple genetic forms that present specific
clinical characteristics.
for example, the long-qt syndrome (lqts) is no longer
considered as one disease, but rather, it is seen as a family of
diseases that share the common feature of a prolonged qt
interval at surface electrocardiogram (ecg) but that may
have different severity and different prognosis depending on
the underlying genetic abnormality (priori et al., 2004a).
accordingly, in this disease, gene-specific risk stratification
algorithms and gene-specific treatments are being developed,
providing a novel twist in the management of patients affected
by this family of disorders (priori et al., 2003a).
in this review, we will summarize the perturbations
induced by mutations that cause cardiac channellopathies,

and we will present the most recent advancements in the
development of therapeutic strategies to counteract these
derangements.

2. diseases of potassium currents
mutations in the genes encoding cardiac ion channels
that conduct different potassium currents (i ks, i kr, and i k1)
have been associated with different cardiac channellopathies. the genes implicated are  xxxg1268xxx  and  xxxg1245xxx 
encoding for the iks channel,  xxxg1246xxx  and kcne2 encoding
for the i kr channel, and kcnj2 encoding for the i k1
channel (fig. 1).
mutations in these genes generates at least 5
different clinical phenotypes: romano-ward long-qt
syndrome (lqts), jervell and lange-nielsen lqts
(priori et al., 2004a), short-qt syndrome (sqts;
gussak et al., 2000), andersen syndrome (as; andersen et al., 1971), and familial atrial fibrillation (faf;
chen et al., 2003).
at first sight, it may seem surprising that so many
phenotypes are linked to mutations in few genes;
however, the clinical manifestations reflect the electrophysiological abnormalities caused by the specific genetic
defect. two types of mutations can be identified: those in
which the function of the channel is increased (‘‘gain of
function’’ mutations) and those in which the activity of
the ion channels is substantially diminished or even lost
(‘‘loss of function’’ mutations). there are therefore
diseases caused by loss of function mutations of

potassium channels such as romano-ward-lqts, jervell
and lange-nielsen lqts, and andersen syndrome, and
there are diseases caused by gain of function mutations
like short-qt syndrome and familial atrial fibrillation
(table 1).
in the following paragraphs, we will briefly describe the
clinical features of these diseases and the strategies for the
development of targeted therapies.
2.1. phenotypes associated with loss
of function potassium current mutations
2.1.1. long-qt syndrome
six lqts variants are due to  xxxg1232xxx 
mutations (table 1). four ( xxxg1268xxx ,  xxxg1246xxx ,  xxxg1245xxx , and
lqt6) are autosomal dominant and two (jln1 and jln2)
are autosomal recessive. both dominant (the romano-ward
syndrome) and recessive lqts (the jervell and langenielsen syndrome, jln) present with qt interval prolongation and cardiac arrhythmias often leading to sudden
death (priori et al., 2004a). however, jln is also
characterized by sensineural deafness. the gene for  xxxg1268xxx 
and jln1 is  xxxg1268xxx , while  xxxg1245xxx  causes  xxxg1245xxx  and
jln2.
 xxxg1268xxx  and  xxxg1245xxx  encode for the alpha- and the
beta-subunits of the  xxxg1232xxx  conducting the i ks
current (barhanin et al., 1996), with the slow component
of the delayed rectifier current (i k) the major repolarizing
current during phase 3 of the cardiac action potential (fig.
1). the alpha-subunit of the i ks channel is a plasmalemmal protein with 6 transmembrane segments linked by
intracellular and extracellular loops; both amino- and

carboxy-terminus are located in the cytoplasm. in order
to make a functional channel, alpha-subunits combine to
form homotetramers and they co-assemble with betasubunits (that are small proteins with a single transmembrane segment).
 xxxg1268xxx  is the most prevalent genetic form of lqts,
accounting for ¨ 50% of genotyped patients (priori et al.,
2003b; splawski et al., 2000; tester et al., 2005).
homozygous or compound heterozygous mutations of
 xxxg1268xxx  also cause jln1.  xxxg1245xxx  ( xxxg1245xxx ) mutations are

rather infrequent, accounting ¨ 2 – 3% of genotyped lqts
patients, and they may cause both romano-ward ( xxxg1245xxx )
and, if homozygous, jervell and lange-nielsen (jln2;
splawski et al., 1997).
 xxxg1246xxx  ( xxxg1246xxx ) and kcne2 (lqt6) genes encode,
respectively, for the alpha- and the beta-subunits of the
 xxxg1232xxx  conducting the i kr current, the rapid
component of the cardiac delayed rectifier (fig. 1). the
alpha-subunit of the i kr channel has a structure similar to
that of the alpha-subunit of the i ks channel, with the typical
6 transmembrane segments, and it also forms homotetramers in the plasmalemma. the presence of the betasubunit (single transmembrane segment), to recapitulate a
fully operational current, has been postulated (abbott et al.,
1999).  xxxg1246xxx  is the second most common variant of lqts,
accounting for 35 – 40% of mutations. mutations in the
kcne2 gene (abbott et al., 1999) cause the lqt6 variant
of lqts, which is a very uncommon variant of the disease
(< 1% of genotyped patients).
2.1.2. genotype – phenotype correlation
in potassium-dependent long-qt syndrome
 xxxg1268xxx  ( xxxg1268xxx  gene) and  xxxg1246xxx  ( xxxg1246xxx  gene) are the
2 most common genetic variants of long-qt syndrome. in
the last decade, several studies provided evidences showing
that the clinical picture of these 2 variants differs for several
aspects: st – t wave morphology (moss et al., 1995),
triggers for cardiac events (schwartz et al., 2001), risk of
cardiac events (priori et al., 2003b), penetrance (priori et al.,
1999), and response to beta-blocker therapy (priori et al.,
2004b).
 xxxg1245xxx  and lqt6 are relatively uncommon. therefore,
genotype –phenotype correlations have been less clearly
defined. in general,  xxxg1245xxx  is similar to  xxxg1268xxx  (both variants
affects the i ks current), but with milder manifestations and
lower penetrance; similarly, lqt6 has mild manifestation
and low penetrance. interestingly, allelic variants in the
kcne2 gene have also been linked to drug-induced lqts
(qt prolongation and ventricular arrhythmias developing
after the assumption of drugs that may prolong cardiac
repolarization (www.qtdrugs.org) in subjects clinically
silent before drug exposure (sesti et al., 2000). this
evidence further supports the mild phenotype associated
with kcne2 gene.
2.1.3. andersen syndrome (as/lqt7)
andersen syndrome is characterized by cardiac and
extracardiac involvement (andersen et al., 1971). the
disease has 3 major clinical features: potassium-sensitive
periodic paralysis, qt prolongation with ventricular
arrhythmias, and dysmorphic features (short stature, hypertelorism, broad nasal root, and defect of soft and hard
palate; tawil et al., 1994). besides qt interval prolongation, as patients present morphological repolarization
abnormalities consisting in a late t wave component
resembling a ‘‘giant’’ u wave. bidirectional ventricular

tachycardia has been also reported as a distinguishing
pattern of arrhythmias. the genetic background of as has
been recently elucidated by plaster et al. (2001), who
mapped this disorder to the locus 17q23 and identified
mutations in the kcnj2 gene. kcnj2 encodes an
inwardly rectifier  xxxg1232xxx , kir2.1, highly
expressed in the heart and its skeletal muscle (fig. 1).
kir 2.1 is responsible for the i k1 current that participates in
the control of the resting membrane potential. a single
kir2.1 protein has 2 transmembrane segments and forms
homotetramers similarly to the 6 transmembrane segments
channels.
approximately 60% of as patients harbour kcnj2
mutations (donaldson et al., 2004). not all patients present
a full blown disease characterized by multi-organ abnormalities; among patients with kcnj2 defects, there are
individuals who only show qt interval prolongation in the
absence of other dysmorphisms and of periodic paralysis
(fodstad et al., 2004). for this reason, kcnj2-related qt
prolongation is also classified as the lqt7 variant of the
long-qt syndrome.
2.2. functional consequences of
 xxxg1232xxx  mutations leading
to long-qt syndrome and andersen syndrome
the lqts variants linked to  xxxg1232xxx  mutations are due to loss of function mutations (table 1). the
functional expression of mutant proteins in heterologous
cellular systems has clearly shown the impairment of
repolarizing currents. this abnormal slowing of the repolarization process prolongs action potential, and this prolongation is reflected into the qt interval prolongation.
the biophysical mechanisms leading to the impairment
of repolarization are multiple. the majority of mutations are
present in heterozygosis, meaning that 50% of the proteins,
those produced by the wild-type allele, are functionally
normal, and this leads to the formation of ion channels that
are made of various proportion of ‘‘normal’’ and ‘‘mutant’’
proteins. the integration of mutant proteins may be
deleterious and even alter the function of the wild-type
protein (dominant negative interaction resulting in > 50%
reduction of current).
in some instances, the defective (mutant) proteins lose
the ability to co-assemble with wild-type subunits, and
therefore, they do not participate to channel structuring:
frequently, these abnormal proteins is retained in the
golgi apparatus (trafficking defect). in such instances, the
functional defect is mainly due to the ‘‘lack’’ of proteins
that determines a 50% current reduction (haploinsufficiency; priori et al., 2004c). rescue of trafficking is one
of the possible gene-specific strategies for loss of function
 xxxg1232xxx  mutations (see section 2.3.2).
kcnj2 mutations associated with as/lqt7 cause loss
of function mainly through a dominant-negative suppression of wild-type kir2.1 subunits (tristani-firouzi et al.,

c. napolitano et al. / pharmacology & therapeutics 110 (2006) 1 – 13

2002). computer simulation studies showed that a kir2.1
impairment prolongs the terminal phase of the cardiac
action potential and, in the setting of reduced extracellular [k+], induces delayed afterdepolarizations (dads)
and spontaneous arrhythmias (tristani-firouzi et al.,
2002).
2.3. gene-specific targeting of loss
of function  xxxg1232xxx  mutations
while at present, no attempts have been carried out to
specifically counteract the detrimental effects of  xxxg1268xxx /
 xxxg1245xxx  and kcnj2 mutations either in the research
laboratory or at clinical level, approaches to correct the
consequence of mutation in knch2 ( xxxg1246xxx ) mutants have
been extensively explored. the focus of this form of lqts
is probably justified by the fact that carriers of  xxxg1246xxx 
mutations are quite refractory to treatment with betablockers that instead are able to reduce sudden death in
the carriers of mutations on the  xxxg1268xxx  gene (priori et al.,
2004b).
2.3.1. potassium control
the conductance of i kr channels is increased by high
extracellular [k+] (sanguinetti & jurkiewicz, 1991). compton et al. (1996) thought that this property could be used
for a therapeutic goal, and they hypothesized that
increasing extracellular [k+] by oral potassium supplements could enhance i kr and at least partially compensate
for the loss of current induced by  xxxg1246xxx  mutations.
these authors initiated a pilot clinical investigation and
showed that by increasing plasma potassium concentration
by  1.5 meq/l above baseline, it is possible to induce a
compensatory increase in the conductance of ikr and
shorten qt interval (compton et al., 1996; table 2).

ment is considered, it will be important to show if, besides
shortening repolarization, potassium supplements are able
to prevent cardiac arrhythmias in carriers of  xxxg1246xxx 
mutations.
2.3.2. rescue of defective trafficking
defective intracellular trafficking of  xxxg1268xxx  (gouas et
al., 2004) and  xxxg1246xxx  (zhou et al., 1998) mutants is an
important pathophysiological mechanism in potassiumdependent lqts.
in 1999, zhou et al. demonstrated that culturing cells at
lower temperature (27 -c instead of 37 -c) or in the
presence of compounds such as e4031,  xxxd236xxx , or
 xxxd1708xxx , the trafficking into the plasma membrane is
restored. unfortunately, these compounds are also i kr
blockers, and the 2 effects (rescue of trafficking and channel
blockade) occur at similar concentrations. as a consequence, the benefit provided by the rescue of protein
trafficking is diminished by the blockade of the same
channel (zhou et al., 1999). irrespective of this problem,
these studies have provided the proof of the concept that it is
possible to identify pharmacological approaches that can
restore protein trafficking, thus creating the foundations for
a novel therapeutic approach. accordingly, other drugs have
been tested in the attempt to separate the effect on
trafficking from that of blockade of the i kr channel, and 2
agents were found to be particularly promising: fexofenadine, a metabolite of terfenadine (rajamani et al., 2002),
and thapsigargin, an inhibitor of serca pump (delisle et
al., 2003). both agents showed a significant restoration of
trafficking but without blocking the ikr current. taken
together, these studies suggest that is possible to dissociate
the i kr blocking activity from the ability to restore normal
trafficking, bringing this strategy closer to clinical applicability (table 2).
2.4. phenotypes associated with gain
of function potassium current mutations
2.4.1. short-qt syndrome
short-qt syndrome (sqts) has been only recently
brought to the attention of the medical community (gussak
et al., 2000) as a clinical entity characterized by high risk of
sudden death in the setting on an abnormally short
ventricular repolarization. at present, only 23 cases from
6 different families have been described (bjerregaard &
gussak, 2005; priori et al., 2005), but the present experience
suggests that the disease may be highly lethal and the
development of effective pharmacological treatment is
warranted (see below).
the first reported patients had a qt interval of 260 – 275
msec, but more recent data have shown sqts patients with
qt duration up to 320 msec (priori et al., 2005). therefore,
at present, despite that the cut off values for lower qt
interval limit has not been clearly established, it appears
rational to consider sqts diagnosis for heart rate corrected

6

c. napolitano et al. / pharmacology & therapeutics 110 (2006) 1 – 13

qt interval (qtc) values < 350 msec. morphological
abnormalities of the t wave are also often present: high
and peaked t waves (hyperkalemia-like morphology) or
asymmetrical t waves with a normal ascending phase and a
very rapid descending phase.
three sqts have been identified (table 1):  xxxg1246xxx 
(brugada et al., 2004),  xxxg1268xxx  (bellocq et al., 2004), and
kcnj2 (priori et al., 2005), but the small number of
genotyped families ( xxxg1246xxx , n = 2;  xxxg1268xxx , n = 1; kcnj2,
n = 1) prevents the assessment of genotype – phenotype
correlations.

mutations that increase the i ks current present arrhythmias
both in ventricles and in the atria (atrial fibrillation; gaita et
al., 2003).
all the sqts and faf mutants so far reported cause gain
of function of potassium channels, and therefore, the final
common mechanisms for the pathologic phenotype is the
shortening of the cardiac action potential its refractory
period.

2.4.2. familial atrial fibrillation
atrial fibrillation is the most common sustained
arrhythmia encountered in clinical practice, and it is the
major cause of embolic stroke. although it usually arises
as an acquired disorder, in 3% to 31% of cases, no
underlying structural abnormalities of the heart muscle can
be detected. in some cases, a familial inheritance is also
evident (wolff, 1943). chen et al. (2003) identified the
first familial atrial fibrillation (faf) mutation in the
 xxxg1268xxx  gene, showing an autosomal dominant transmission. recently, another faf mutation has been reported
in the kcne2 gene, causing an arginine-to-cysteine
mutation at position 27 (r27c). this mutation was found
in 2/28 probands of families with faf in whom a
systematic screening of cardiac ion channel encoding
genes was carried out (yang et al., 2004).

the gene specific strategy for the treatment of sqts
patients, carriers of gain of function mutations of the  xxxg1246xxx 
gene, seemed quite straightforward, and investigators immediately attempted to use i kr blocking agents such as sotalol
and ibutilide (gaita et al., 2004) in these patients. unfortunately, this apparently logical therapeutic strategy leads to
unsuccessful clinical results. it was necessary to perform in
vitro expression studies (brugada et al., 2004) to demonstrate that the sqts mutations not only increase the
conductance of i kr, but they also reduce the affinity of i kr
blockers for the channel, thus interfering with the potential
therapeutic efficacy of these agents. therefore, the specific
properties of this sqts mutation represent an important
hurdle to the development of gene-specific therapy. nonetheless, the availability of functional data showing abnormal
increase of net outward potassium current suggests that the
use of less specific blocker may counteract the effect of
mutation on action potential duration.
on these bases, gaita et al. (2004) tried a different
approach to prolong repolarization in sqts patients using
quinidine, which is a drug with a composite electrophysiological profile. quinidine blocks a variety of ionic currents
such as i na, i kr (open state blocker), i ks, i k1, and both the
transient inward current (i to) and the atp-sensitive
potassium currents (i katp); all these effects concur to
prolonging the cardiac action potential. this agent was able
to normalize qt interval duration in few sqts patients with
 xxxg1246xxx  mutations (table 2).
although this preliminary result seem to be encouraging,
it is still unknown whether quinidine can affect mortality
and whether this drug represents a treatment for all sqts
patients or it is specifically indicated for those with
mutations in the  xxxg1246xxx  gene.

2.5. functional consequences of
 xxxg1232xxx  mutations leading to
short-qt syndrome and familial atrial fibrillation
the sqts –  xxxg1246xxx  mutation induces remarkable alteration of i kr kinetic with a loss of channel rectification at
depolarized potentials. this abnormality translates in a
larger outward potassium current during the initial phases
of cardiac action potential (early repolarization phase;
brugada et al., 2004; table 1). current kinetic is also
affected in sqts –  xxxg1268xxx , where significantly faster
activation and negative shift of activation voltage result
in a larger i ks current (bellocq et al., 2004). finally, the
sqts – kcnj2 mutation causes a net increase of outward
current and a positive shift of peak i k1 (priori et al., 2005).
interestingly, computer simulations showed that the mutation induced a significant shortening of action potential
and the simulated surface electrocardiogram closely
resembles the st –t wave pattern observed at clinical
level (priori et al., 2005).
along the same line, faf mutations also increase the i ks
(chen et al., 2003; yang et al., 2004). however, it remains
to be elucidated why no mutations identified in familial
atrial fibrillation cause selective electrophysiologic abnormalities in the atria and do not cause an abnormal phenotype
in ventricular tissue. this observation is particularly difficult
to explain because patients with sqts and gain of function

of function  xxxg1232xxx  mutations

3. diseases of the cardiac sodium channel
the alpha-subunit of the cardiac sodium channel
( xxxg2028xxx ), encoded by the  xxxg2028xxx  gene, is a transmembrane
protein composed of 4 homologous domains (di-div), each
containing 6 transmembrane segments (s1– s6). this alphasubunit alone is per se able to conduct a current closely
resembling the i na current recorded in cardiac myocytes, the
major determinant of the phase 0 (upstroke) of the cardiac

c. napolitano et al. / pharmacology & therapeutics 110 (2006) 1 – 13

action potential (fig. 1). two auxiliary beta-subunits concur
to form the channel. it has been suggested that the betasubunits modulate the ionic flux through the channel (an et
al., 1998; kupershmidt et al., 1998).
four genetic arrhythmogenic disorders are caused by
 xxxg2028xxx  mutations: the  xxxg2028xxx  variant of long-qt syndrome
(wang et al., 1995), the brugada syndrome (brs; chen et
al., 1998), the progressive cardiac conduction defect (ccd;
schott et al., 1999), and the sick sinus syndrome (sss;
table 1).
in analogy to what was described for the potassium
channels, also the  xxxg2028xxx -related phenotypes are secondary
to either gain ( xxxg2028xxx ) or loss (brs, ccd, and sss) of
function mutations. while  xxxg2028xxx  and brs have been
extensively studied in the last decade, much less is known
concerning the epidemiological relevance of  xxxg2028xxx  mutations linked to ccd and sss. in the following sections, we
will describe the clinical features and the strategies currently
being developed for gene-specific therapy of  xxxg2028xxx  and
brs.
3.1.  xxxg2028xxx 
 xxxg2028xxx  mutations are identified in ¨10% of genotyped
lqts patients (splawski et al., 2000; tester et al., 2005;
priori, personal communication), and gene-specific clinical
manifestations have also been described for this variant. the
distinguishing t wave pattern of  xxxg2028xxx  patients is that of a
markedly prolonged st segment and a peaked, narrow t
wave. at variance with  xxxg1232xxx -related lqts,
this disease typically manifests with susceptibility to
arrhythmias occurring at rest or during sleep (schwartz et
al., 2001). overall,  xxxg2028xxx  is a severe variant (priori et al.,
2003b) that responds less favorably to beta-blocker therapy
as compared with  xxxg1268xxx  (priori et al., 2004b). for this
reason, the development of additional therapeutic tools is
desirable in the attempt of protecting high-risk patients from
life-threatening cardiac arrhythmias.
several electrophysiological consequences of  xxxg2028xxx 
mutants have been identified (bennett et al., 1995; wang
et al., 1996; abriel et al., 2001; rivolta et al., 2001): late
sustained current, slower rate of inactivation, faster recovery
from inactivation, and gating shifts. furthermore, abnormal
interaction with beta-1-subunit has also been reported
(eckardt et al., 2002). overall, functional studies support
the view that na+ channel mutations originate the lqts
phenotype by inducing a ‘‘gain of function’’ of the protein
with enhanced inward current, which prolongs action
potential duration.
3.1.1. gene-specific targeting of
gain of function  xxxg2028xxx  mutations
sodium channel blockade represents a rational approach
for a gene-specific therapy in  xxxg2028xxx  since mutations induce
an excess of sodium entering into the cells during phase 0
(depolarization) of cardiac action potential (table 2).

7

preliminary experimental and clinical evidences show that
 xxxd2635xxx  effectively shortens action potential (in a cellular
model of  xxxg2028xxx ) and the qt interval (in  xxxg2028xxx  patients;
schwartz et al., 1995; priori et al., 1996; fig. 2). despite
that short-term efficacy of  xxxd2635xxx  to prevent lethal
events and to restore atrioventricular (av) conduction was
reported (schwartz et al., 2000; kehl et al., 2004), there are
no long-term prospective data demonstrating that  xxxd2635xxx 
improves survival in  xxxg2028xxx  patients.
interestingly, experimental observations have suggested
that the efficacy of i na blockade may be mutation-specific
(rivolta et al., 2004), and the same mutation may not
respond equally to different sodium channel blockers. for
instance, the effects of d1790g are selectively blocked by
 xxxd2113xxx  but not by lidocaine during repetitive stimulations (use-dependent block; abriel et al., 2000).
clinical experience suggests that the sodium channel
blocker  xxxd2113xxx  should be used with caution in  xxxg2028xxx 
patients since it may induce st-segment elevation, resembling a brugada syndrome ecg, in ¨ 50% of cases when
administered to unselected  xxxg2028xxx  patients (priori et al.,
2000; fig. 3). the use of  xxxd2113xxx  in  xxxg2028xxx  should be
limited to patients for whom the lack of st-segment
elevation is clearly demonstrated.
thus, sodium channel blockade is a rational and
promising approach for the treatment of  xxxg2028xxx  patients.
the experimental findings showing that there could be a
mutation-specific effect and that not all i na blockers are
equally effective, indicating that there are still knowledge
gaps to fill (abriel et al., 2000; rivolta et al., 2004).
nonetheless, the clinical data suggest that  xxxd2635xxx  may
be used as an adjunctive treatment to beta blockade or to the
implantable cardioverter defibrillator (icd) to prevent
cardiac events in high-risk  xxxg2028xxx  patients.

segment elevation observed in 2  xxxg2028xxx  patients (upper and lower panels)
upon intravenous administration of 2 mg/kg of  xxxd2113xxx  over 10 min are
shown. despite qt shortening, a clear-cut st segment elevation resembling
brugada syndrome is evident.

typical ecg pattern of st-segment elevation in the right
precordial leads with or without right bundle branch block
(brugada & brugada, 1992). cardiac events usually occur
during sleep and in the early morning hours (matsuo et al.,
1999).
brugada syndrome is transmitted as an autosomal
dominant trait. in 1998, chen et al. reported brs patients
and families harbouring mutations in the  xxxg2028xxx  gene, thus
suggesting that brs is allelic to  xxxg2028xxx . more than 50 brsscn5a mutations have now been reported, and they are
found in ¨ 20% of brs patients. unfortunately, no other
gene has been identified so far, and therefore, genotype –
phenotype correlations are not possible.
functional expression studies showed a spectrum of
biophysical abnormalities leading to a loss of function of the
cardiac sodium channel (priori et al., 2003a), such as (1)
failure of the channel to express (haploinsufficiency, with
trafficking defect); (2) shift of voltage- and time-dependent
channel activation, inactivation, or reactivation; (3) entry of
the i na into an intermediate, slowly recovering, state of
inactivation; (4) accelerate inactivation; furthermore, (5)
trafficking defects have also been identified in selected
 xxxg2028xxx  mutants (baroudi et al., 2001; valdivia et al., 2002,
2004).
at present, there is no effective pharmacologic treatment
to prevent arrhythmias in brs, and the icd is the only
option for high-risk individuals. thus, the development of a
pharmacological approach to counteract the electrophysiological abnormalities induced by mutations would bear a
remarkable improvement of our clinical management
capabilities for brs patients.

3.2.1. gene-specific targeting of
loss of function  xxxg2028xxx  mutations
quinidine, a nonspecific blocker of cardiac transient
outward current (i to), has been proposed as gene-specific
therapy for brs (table 2). the rational beyond this
approach is based on the idea that the loss of sodium
inward current in brs tilts the balance between outward
and inward currents during cardiac action potential. the
abnormal shift in the outward direction at the end of
phase 1 of the action potential and the nonuniform
distribution of this current in the myocardium would
create an inhomogeneous repolarization pattern (antzelevitch, 2001).therefore, blocking repolarizing currents, and
specifically i to, which is active during the initial phases
of action potential, could restore the equilibrium (yan &
antzelevitch, 1999). based on this theory, some authors
have attempted a gene-specific approach of therapy in
brs.
the available clinical data show that quinidine prevents
arrhythmia inducibility at programmed electrical stimulation
(pes) in up to 76% of brs patients (belhassen et al., 1999,
2004; hermida et al., 2004) and suggest a positive long-term
effect in preventing the occurrence of spontaneous arrhythmias (belhassen et al., 2004). unfortunately, high incidence
of gastrointestinal (gi) side effects may reduce patient
compliance (belhassen et al., 2004). tedisamil, a novel antiischemic and antiarrhythmic drug still in the premarketing
phase, has been proposed as an alternative to quinidine in
brs patients (freestone & lip, 2004), but clinical data are
not yet available.
 xxxd1698xxx , an oral  xxxg1695xxx  inhibitor marketed as an antiplatelet agent, has been used in a single brs
patient, in whom it can normalize the st-segment and
prevent the occurrence of ventricular fibrillation (vf;
tsuchiya et al., 2002).  xxxd1698xxx  increases i ca by inhibiting
phosphodiesterase activity in ventricular myocytes, and it
decreases i to (table 2).
overall, the approaches so far proposed for a genespecific therapy of brs involve the blocking of i to current.
the available data suggest a possible clinical efficacy only
for  xxxd3067xxx . this treatment should be currently regarded as
an adjunctive treatment to icd in the attempt of reducing
the number of device interventions for high-risk patients and
not as a first line therapy.
3.2.2. rescue of defective trafficking
trafficking-defective mutants have also been identified
in  xxxg2028xxx  and associated with brs (baroudi et al., 2001;
valdivia et al., 2002, 2004). interestingly,  xxxd2635xxx  was
able to restore i na by rescuing the proper localization of the
protein (valdivia et al., 2004). however,  xxxd2635xxx  also
blocks the sodium channel (see gain of function  xxxg2028xxx 
mutations), which, of course, is not desirable for brs
therapy. whether the separation of channel blocking effect
from trafficking restoration is feasible has not been proven
so far.

4. disease of calcium channels
during the plateau phase of cardiac action potential,
extracellular ca2+ that enters though l-type calcium (i ca)
elicits ca2+ release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (sr),
mainly through the ryanodine receptor (ryr2; the so-called
calcium-induced calcium release, cicr). therefore, the
control of ca2+ fluxes in the cardiac cells is a crucial
component of the several pathways that, if genetically
altered, may cause susceptibility to life-threatening cardiac
arrhythmias. the pathophysiological relevance of ca2+
handling is further outlined by the recent developments of
molecular genetics that allowed to identify mutations in the
2 major calcium channels in patients affected by 2 highly
malignant inherited arrhythmogenic diseases: the timothy
syndrome (ts- xxxg304xxx ; splawski et al., 2004) and the
catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia
(cpvt; priori et al., 2001).
4.1. timothy syndrome
timothy syndrome (ts), also defined as  xxxg304xxx , is a rare
and malignant variant of long-qt syndrome presenting with
qt interval prolongation, syndactyly, and a spectrum of
additional cardiac and extracardiac manifestations (marks et
al., 1995a, 1995b; levin, 1996; joseph-reynolds et al.,
1997). only few patients affected by this disease have been
reported so far, and therefore, a comprehensive clinical
characterization of patients is still lacking.
ventricular repolarization of ts patients is usually
markedly prolonged (qt interval duration exceed 550 msec
in the majority of cases; napolitano et al., 2001), and it
causes the development of 2:1 functional atrioventricular
block. macroscopic t wave electrical alternans is an
additional electrocardiographic feature of ts. this repolarization pattern is invariably associated with cutaneous
syndactyly (hands and feet) and a number of additional
abnormal phenotypes occurring with variable incidence
among the affected subjects: patent doctus arteriosus
(60%), patent foramen ovale (29%), ventricular septal
defect (18%), tetralogy of fallot (6%), and central nervous
system abnormalities (mental retardation, 25%; autism,
60%). furthermore, metabolic (severe hypoglycaemia) and
immunologic (recurrent infections) disturbances are present
in ¨ 40% of cases.
the molecular bases of ts have been recently characterized in a collaborative study in which a missense
mutation in the  xxxg304xxx  gene encoding for the cardiac
voltage-gated calcium channel ( xxxg304xxx ) was identified
(table 1 and fig. 1; splawski et al., 2004). interestingly,
the same mutation g408r was identified in all the 13
probands in whom the analysis was performed. in vitro
functional characterization showed that the molecular
defects induce a gain of function by delaying the inactivation of the channels due to loss of the voltage-dependent
component of the inactivation process. this abnormality

9

leads to a net increase of i ca and a prolongation of action
potential duration (splawski et al., 2004).
the therapeutic approach to  xxxg304xxx  is unavoidably
empiric due to limited clinical experience. no indication
of the effectiveness of beta-blockers or other drugs is
available, and because of the high risk of severe arrhythmias, primary prevention with icd may be considered.
4.2. gene-specific targeting of gain of
function mutation in the cardiac calcium channel  xxxg304xxx 
the  xxxg304xxx  mutation increases the amount of calcium
entering into the cardiac myocytes during the plateau phase
of the cardiac action potential. therefore, the administration
of l-type calcium channel blockers may be a rational
strategy to attempt to counteract the genetic defect of ts.
at present, only anecdotal experience exists on the
efficacy of calcium channel blockers in ts patients. in a 7year-old girl with marked prolongation of qt interval and
macroscopic t wave alternans, we assessed the effect on qt
interval duration of an acute administration of diltiazem (0.3
mg/kg over 10 min; fig. 4) but failed to show any
significant shortening on qt interval. however, few months
later, the patient experienced an arrhythmic storm with
several episodes of ventricular fibrillation and she was
successfully converted to stable sinus rhythm only after
continuous infusion of diltiazem (0.1/mg/kg/hr) and
repeated (2 –3 hr apart) intravenous 1 mg bolus (priori sg
and gasparini m, personal communication). although
anecdotal, this case may suggest that high doses of calcium
antagonists could be effective in the acute management of
arrhythmic storms in ts.
4.3. catecholaminergic
polymorphic ventricular tachycardia
catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia
(cpvt) is an autosomal dominant arrhythmogenic disorder
in the structurally normal heart that causes stress-induced
syncope or sudden cardiac death (scd) in young individuals (coumel et al., 1978; leenhardt et al., 1995). at
variance with the other inherited arrhythmogenic syndromes, the baseline ecg is unremarkable. therefore,
diagnosis is uniquely based on the demonstration of
ventricular tachycardia (often presenting a peculiar bidirecbaseline

tional pattern) elicited during exercise or emotional stress
(leenhardt et al., 1995; priori et al., 2002).
in 2001, based on previous linkage mapping data (swan
et al., 1999), we identified the cardiac ryanodine receptor
gene ryr2 as the gene involved in the pathogenesis of
cpvt (priori et al., 2001). the ryanodine receptor is the
most important ca2+ releasing channel in the cardiac
sarcoplasmic reticulum (sr). it localizes across the
membrane of the sr and releases ca2+ in response to
the calcium entry through the l-type channels ( xxxg304xxx )
during the phase 2 of the cardiac action potential.
experimental data suggest that cpvt mutations destabilize
the protein with consequent ca2+ overload during repolarization and electric diastole, thus facilitating the occurrence of delayed afterdepolarizations (dads; marks et al.,
2002). functional characterization of the mutants (jiang et
al., 2002; wehrens et al., 2003) confirmed that they all
produce abnormal ca2+ release in response to adrenergic
stimulation.
a rare autosomal recessive variant of cpvt has also
been described and linked to the casq2 gene on
chromosome 1p11 –p13. this gene encodes for calsequestrin and is involved in ca2+ homeostasis by serving the
major ca2+ buffering protein into the sr cisternae. therefore, casq2 has a direct role in the modulation of the cicr
(viatchenko-karpinski et al., 2004).
beta-blockers are the mainstay of cpvt therapy and
achieve a satisfactory control of arrhythmias in several
cases (leenhardt et al., 1995; priori et al., 2001, 2002).
however, 10 –30% of patients continue to experience lifethreatening arrhythmias during beta-blocker therapy and, at
present, are candidates for icd implant (leenhardt et al.,
1995; priori et al., 2002). therefore, the identification of
additional pharmacological interventions specifically targeted to counteract the effects of mutations would be
extremely welcome.
4.4. gene-specific targeting of abnormal calcium
handling in a knock-out animal model relevant to
catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia
one of the possible pathophysiological mechanisms for
of ryr2 mutations in cpvt is a decreased binding of
calstabin 2 (a ‘‘stabilizer’’ of the channel in the closed state,
also known as  xxxg798xxx .6) to the ryr2 channel (lehnart et
al., 2004a). interestingly, a similar mechanism has been
proposed also for the pathogenesis of ventricular dysfunction and, possibly, scd during heart failure (yano et al.,
2003; lehnart et al., 2004a). in knock-out calstabin 2
haploinsufficient ( /+) mice (indirectly mimicking the
effects of ryr2 mutations), the experimental agent
jtv519, a 1,4-benzothiazepine derivative that favors the
binding of calstabin 2 to ryr2 (yano et al., 2003), has been
shown to prevent the occurrence of ventricular arrhythmias
(wehrens et al., 2004). further in vitro experiments on a
ryr2 mutant (lehnart et al., 2004b) showed that jtv519

restores the normal activity of the channel. these findings
suggest that ryr stabilization in the closed state, by
recovering calstabin 2 affinity, could represent a genespecific therapy for cpvt. this approach will have now to
be tested in the recently developed knock-in mouse model
of cpvt (cerrone et al., 2005).

5. conclusions
in the past decade, molecular biology has allowed to
elucidate the genetic background of several inherited
diseases predisposing to cardiac arrhythmias and scd.
functional characterization of mutant proteins has provided
fascinating insights about the electrophysiological derangements that account for the phenotypes. now that genetics
has already entered clinical cardiology, playing a role for
diagnosis and for novel risk-stratification strategies, fundamental research has already set its next goal, and several
groups are turning their attention toward the development of
locus specific therapies. preliminary experimental studies
have been successful, and few clinical pilot projects are
indicating how to direct further research (table 2). genespecific therapies (e.g.,  xxxd2635xxx  for  xxxg2028xxx  patients and
quinidine for brs patients) are moving from the bench-side
to initial clinical applications. the availability of new
models, such as expression of mutant proteins in cardiac
myocytes and the use of transgenic animals, opens very
promising perspectives for the further development of these
novel therapies.
