abstract
 xxxd2665xxx  (mf) is a highly potent glucocorticoid used topically to treat inflammation in
the lung, nose and on the skin. however, so far no information has been published on the human
 xxxg1601xxx  activity of the metabolites or degradation products of mf. we have now
determined the relative receptor binding affinities of the known metabolite  xxxd1946xxx -oh mf and the
degradation product 9,11-epoxy mf to understand their possible contribution to undesirable
systemic side effects. in competition experiments with human lung glucocorticoid receptors we
have determined the relative receptor affinities (rra) of these substances with reference to
dexamethasone (rra = 100). we have discovered that  xxxd1946xxx -oh mf and 9,11-epoxy mf display
rras of 206 ± 15 and 220 ± 22, respectively. this level of activity is similar to that of the clinically
used inhaled corticosteroid  xxxd2126xxx  (rra 180 ± 11). furthermore we observed that 9,11-epoxy
mf is a chemically reactive metabolite. in recovery experiments with human plasma and lung tissue
we found a time dependent decrease in extractability of the compound. hence, we provide data
that might contribute to the understanding of the pharmacokinetics as well as the clinical effects of
mf.

introduction
 xxxd2665xxx  (mf) is a highly potent topical glucocorticoid for the treatment of asthma [1], allergic rhinitis [2] and various skin diseases [3]. the clinical efficacy of
mf is comparable to that of  xxxd2145xxx  [4].
both compounds have a very high affinity to the human
 xxxg1601xxx . with reference to dexamethasone,  xxxd2145xxx  has an eighteen-fold higher
relative receptor affinity (rra) of 1800 [5,6], while mf
displays a rra of about 2200 [7]. these high receptor
affinities as well as the administered doses, the absolute
lung deposition and a prolonged retention time in the
lung tissue contribute to the clinical success of both
compounds.

besides the efficacy of a corticosteroid, safety issues have
to be taken into consideration. for topically applied glucocorticoids, the high local anti-inflammatory activity
should be paralleled by a low systemic exposure. therefore, a prolonged redistribution from lung tissue into systemic circulation and a rapid and complete hepatic
metabolism of the compounds to inactive derivatives are
favorable. for mf, a very low systemic bioavailability of
less than 1 % has been reported [8]. however, there have
been discussions about the appropriate methodology and
the validity of the conclusion has been questioned [9,10].
indeed, the claimed low systemic bioavailability of mf
would appear to be inconsistent with the considerable
suppression of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (hpa)

axis recorded in a clinical study [11,12]. frequently, various researchers called attention to the formation of active
mf metabolites that would account for undesirable systemic side effects [9,13]. in an early study by isogai et al.
more than ten different metabolites and related compounds of mf displayed varying binding affinities to the
rat  xxxg1601xxx  [14].
there had been, however, not much information on the
extent and site of metabolite formation in humans.
recent studies now provided some of the required information [7,13,15,16]. in rat liver microsomes,  xxxd1946xxx -hydroxy
mf ( xxxd1946xxx -oh mf) was identified as the major metabolite
[16]. this metabolite was also found after incubation of
mf with human liver and intestine microsomes [13].
additionally, the degradation product 9,11-epoxy mf was
detected in plasma and urine. 9,11-epoxy mf is formed in
aqueous solutions [15] indicating a general time- and phdependent instability of mf [7]. recently, we discovered
9,11-epoxy mf in incubation mixtures of human lung tissue as well as in fresh human plasma [7]. we pointed out
that this degradation product might form covalent
adducts with proteins in follow-up reactions.
despite the recent discovery of the major metabolite 6betaoh mf and the abundant degradation product 9,11epoxy mf it is still not clear whether these compounds
retain any significant binding affinity to the human  xxxg1601xxx . in the present study we addressed this
open question and we present some evidence that the degradation product might bind tightly, most possibly covalently, to protein structures in human lung tissue and
plasma.

materials and methods
chemicals and reagents
 xxxd2665xxx  (mf), 6-hydroxy  xxxd2665xxx  (6-oh mf), mometasone and 9,11-epoxy  xxxd2665xxx  (9,11-epoxy mf) were generous gifts from
glaxosmithkline (greenford, england). [3h]-dexamethasone was obtained from amersham (freiburg, germany). all other chemicals were obtained from sigmaaldrich-chemie (taufkirchen, germany) or e. merck
(darmstadt, germany).
source and handling of human specimen
human lung tissue resection material was obtained from
patients with bronchial carcinomas who gave informed
consent. cancer-free tissue was used for the experiments.
none of the patients was treated with glucocorticoids for
the last 4 weeks prior to surgery. tissue samples were
shock frozen in liquid nitrogen after resection and stored
at -70°c until usage. to collect sufficient material for the
experiments, tissue samples of three or more patients were
pooled. lung cytosol for receptor competition experi-

ments was prepared as detailed in [6]. plasma samples
were obtained from healthy volunteers who gave
informed consent. samples were either used immediately
or were shock frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at 70°c until usage.
determination of relative receptor affinity by competition
tests
the competition experiments were performed according
to the procedure described earlier [6]. the displacement of
a constant concentration of [3h] labelled dexamethasone
by various concentrations of 6-oh mf, mometasone and
9,11-epoxy mf was determined.
recovery of mf and 9,11-epoxy mf from human plasma,
lung tissue and buffer
mf or 9,11-epoxy mf, respectively, were added to human
plasma, lung tissue suspension (0.5 g / 20 ml) or buffer
(0.2 m phosphate buffer, ph 7.4) yielding an initial concentration of 0.3 µg/ml. only glass lab ware was used for
these experiments to exclude any non-specific binding
effects of the highly lipophilic compounds to plastic
material. samples were incubated at 37°c in a shaking
water bath. at designated time intervals samples of 1.0 ml
were removed, subjected to a fluid extraction with diethylether and analyzed by hplc.
sample preparation and hplc conditions
samples were prepared and analyzed as described previously [7]. the hplc system consisted of a waters hplc
(milford, ma) with a 1525 binary pump, a 717plus
autosampler and 2487 dual wavelength absorbance detector set at the detection wavelength of 254 nm. data collection and integration were accomplished using breeze™
software version 3.2. analysis was performed on a symmetry c18 column (150 × 4.6 mm i.d., 5 µm particle size,
waters, ma).

results
we determined the relative receptor affinities (rras) of
 xxxd1946xxx -oh mf, 9,11-epoxy mf and mometasone base by
competition assays with reference to dexamethasone
(rra = 100). both, the metabolite  xxxd1946xxx -oh mf and the degradation product 9,11-epoxy mf displayed residual receptor binding affinities about twice as high as
dexamethasone (table 1). this level of activity is between
that of the clinically used inhaled corticosteroids  xxxd2126xxx  (rra 180 ± 11) and  xxxd3418xxx 
(rra 361 ± 26) [5]. mometasone which is formed by
hydrolysis of the furoate ester, revealed an even higher
rra of almost 800. for comparison, the rra of the parent
compound mf is about 2200 [7].
to investigate the putative reactivity of the degradation
product 9,11-epoxy mf we monitored the recovery of mf

and 9,11-epoxy mf from human plasma by organic solvent extraction (fig. 1). the determination of recovery was
limited to a period of three hours since mf is successively
degraded to 9,11-epoxy mf [7]. the retrieval of 9,11epoxy mf from human plasma decreased steadily and was
clearly more pronounced than for mf. after three hours
9.14 ± 2.3 % of 9,11-epoxy mf was not recovered from
plasma while 4.8 ± 1.4 % of mf was not extractable any
more.
the decrease in recovery of 9,11-epoxy mf from human
lung tissue was even more evident (fig. 2). while there

was no change in the control incubation mixture comprising of buffer (ph 7.4) a pronounced and steady decrease
in recovery rates of 9,11-epoxy mf was revealed. after
three hours 16.61 ± 0.58 % of the degradation product
was not extractable any more. no new peaks were
observed in the hplc to indicate a further degradation of
9,11-epoxy mf.

receptor binding affinities of the  xxxd2665xxx

9,11-epoxy mf to understand their possible contribution
to undesirable systemic side effects. for the first time we
provide data that both compounds are significantly active
at the human  xxxg1601xxx  with binding affinities twice as high as dexamethasone and similar to that of
the clinically used inhaled corticosteroids  xxxd2126xxx  and
 xxxd3418xxx  [5]. furthermore, our data demonstrate that the ubiquitous degradation product 9,11epoxy mf undergoes follow-up reactions.
glucocorticoids currently used for topical application in
asthma therapy all share the safety relevant property of
extensive metabolism and formation of inactive metabolites. for mf, however, data was sparse so far. though
putative metabolites and degradation products with binding affinity to the rat  xxxg1601xxx  have been
previously suggested [14], it was not clear whether this
might have any implications to humans. potential human
metabolites such as  xxxd1946xxx -oh mf, mometasone or mf-epoxide have been proposed [8], but experimental evidence of
in vivo formation of these compounds was still lacking.
studies of teng et al. identified  xxxd1946xxx -oh mf and 9,11-epoxy
mf as candidate compounds that can indeed be formed in
vivo either by hepatic metabolism or by simple degradation of mf [13,16]. we discovered that 9,11-epoxy mf is

also formed in human lung tissue suspensions and
plasma [7].
usually hydroxylation at the  xxxd1946xxx  position results in inactivation of the corticosteroid. the 6-oh metabolite of various glucocorticoids displays little or no residual binding
affinity to the receptor (e.g.) [17,18]. this, however, is different for mf with its  xxxd1946xxx -oh metabolite exhibiting a relative receptor affinity of more than 200 (dexamethasone:
100). obviously, the substitution pattern of the d-ring of
mf confers such potent binding affinity that hydroxylation in  xxxd1946xxx  position does not result in complete inactivation of this corticosteroid. notably, neither the rra we
determined for  xxxd1946xxx -oh mf nor for mometasone are coherent with the binding results of the early studies with the
rat glucocorticoid receptors [14]. this emphasizes the
need for data derived from human receptor studies.
the mf degradation product 9,11-epoxy mf also displays
a significant receptor binding affinity with an rra of
about 200. this rra is within the range that could be
expected from the studies of isogai et al. [14]. since 9,11epoxy mf is also formed in the lung tissue suspensions
[7], it can be assumed that it contributes to the effects after
inhalation of mf. it can, however, be predicted that this

compound might be also responsible for undesired effects
such as hpa axis suppression.

metabolites and degradation products after application of
mf.

besides the significant residual receptor binding affinity of
9,11-epoxy mf we discovered that this compound undergoes follow-up reactions. after incubation with plasma
clearly less of 9,11-epoxy mf compared to the parent compound mf was recovered by extraction with an organic
solvent. this extraction procedure usually reliably
retrieves all non-covalently bound substance from the
incubation mixture. in human lung tissue, it was even
more obvious that 9,11-epoxy mf was recovered completely from buffer, but not from the tissue suspension.
about 17 % of 9,11-epoxy mf was "lost" after three hours
of incubation. this observation cannot be explained by
simple non-specific tissue binding since the tissue adsorption reaches equilibrium very quickly after about 20 min
[7]. also, the non-specifically bound compound would be
still extractable by organic solvents. generally, epoxides
are chemically reactive molecules that tend to bind
irreversibly to cellular macromolecules. if this were the
case for 9,11-epoxy mf it would have two implications.
firstly, irreversibly bound 9,11-epoxy mf escapes detection and feigns a low bioavailability after inhalation. the
fact that after inhalation of a single dose of tritium
labelled mf only 88% (63–99 %) of total radioactivity
was recovered over seven days in humans [8] seems to
support this conclusion. secondly, if 9,11-epoxy mf is
indeed covalently bound to cellular macromolecules the
adduct might lead to allergic reactions. such reactions to
corticosteroids for asthma therapy do occur occasionally
[19]. however, it cannot be excluded that 9,11-epoxy mf
is further degraded although we did not observe any new
peaks that emerged in the hplc chromatograms. the
chromatographic conditions were chosen for rather
lipophilic compounds, thus, if a further degradation
product of 9,11-epoxy mf with pronounced hydrophilic
character was formed, it might have escaped our attention. however, the possibility of covalent adduct formation of 9,11-epoxy mf should be further investigated.

authors' contributions

conclusions
in contrast to other inhaled corticosteroids mf generates
an active metabolite,  xxxd1946xxx -oh mf, in the liver. the degradation product 9,11-epoxy mf, which is formed in human
lung tissue and plasma, exhibits significant receptor affinity as well. additionally, we found that 9,11-epoxy mf
undergoes follow-up reactions. our data contribute to the
understanding of how the claimed low bioavailability of
mf parent compound after inhalation might still be
accompanied by hpa axis suppression. thus, our findings
are consistent with both pharmacokinetic and clinical
data. we strongly suggest a clinical trial that determines
both efficacy and safety in parallel as well as all known
