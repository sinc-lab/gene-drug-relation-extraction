purpose
 xxxg1991xxx  encodes the regulatory subunit of ribonucleotide reductase and is a molecular target of
 xxxd2188xxx . previous studies showed increased  xxxg1991xxx  expression on continuous exposure of
cell lines to  xxxd2188xxx  and suggested improved survival for patients with low as opposed to high
tumoral  xxxg1991xxx  expression when treated with  xxxd2188xxx -containing chemotherapy. however,
the principal hypothesis that intratumoral levels of gene expression are associated with disease
response has not been addressed.
patients and methods
we constructed genetically modified lung cancer cell lines with increased and decreased  xxxg1991xxx 
expression to investigate the in vitro 50% inhibitory concentration (ic50) for  xxxd2188xxx , cisplatin, and
carboplatin. a prospective phase ii clinical trial in patients with locally advanced non–small-cell lung
cancer was conducted with pretreatment tumor collection for determination of  xxxg1991xxx  and  xxxg724xxx 
expression by real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. the levels of gene expression
were correlated with tumor response after two cycles of  xxxd2188xxx  and carboplatin.
results
in cell lines with a genetically engineered 15-fold  xxxg1991xxx  expression range, the  xxxd2188xxx  ic50
had a 100-fold range, and the cisplatin and carboplatin ic50 had a two-fold range. they were highest in
constructs with high  xxxg1991xxx  expression. in the prospective clinical trial,  xxxg1991xxx  expression was
significantly (p ⫽ .002) and inversely correlated (r ⫽ ⫺0.498) with disease response.  xxxg724xxx 
expression showed a similar trend (p ⫽ .099).
conclusion
the results strongly suggest that tumoral  xxxg1991xxx  expression is a major predictor of disease
response to  xxxd2188xxx /platinum chemotherapy.  xxxg724xxx  expression is predictive of response
albeit to a lesser degree.

introduction

the principal chemotherapeutic agents used for
treatment of patients with non–small-cell lung cancer (nsclc) are platinum analogs, taxanes,  xxxd2188xxx , and  xxxd3515xxx   xxxd3516xxx . response rates in patients
with advanced stages of the disease to dual agent
therapy, the current standard of care, are 17% to
37%; the median overall survival is 6.7 to 11.3
months, the 1-year survival rate is 31% to 46%, and
the 2-year survival rate is 9% to 21%.1-7 after patients experienced treatment failure of initial therapy, response to further systemic treatment is
approximately 10% for single agents.8-10 thus, resistance to systemic therapy does not appear to be an
all-or-none phenomenon, but rather a function of
molecular characteristics of individual tumors. in

fact, specific molecular characteristics highly associated with tumor response to a class of therapeutic agents used in nsclc, epidermal growth
factor receptor  xxxg2198xxx  inhibitors, has recently been reported.11-13
the  xxxg1991xxx  gene encodes the regulatory subunit
of ribonucleotide reductase, an essential enzyme
that catalyzes the reduction of  xxxd2246xxx  diphosphates to the corresponding deoxyribonucleotides.14-17 it is the molecular target of  xxxd2188xxx 
(2⬘,2⬘-difluorodeoxycytidine), an antimetabolite
with activity in several malignancies including
nsclc.18-20 earlier work had suggested that patients with low as compared with high levels of tumoral  xxxg1991xxx  expression had improved survival
when treated with  xxxd2188xxx -based therapy.21 in
addition, continuous exposure of lung cancer cell
lines to increasing amounts of  xxxd2188xxx  resulted

in increased  xxxg1991xxx  expression.20 however, the principal hypothesis
for these investigations (ie, intratumoral levels of  xxxg1991xxx  expression are
associated with disease response) has not been addressed.
patients and methods
generation of  xxxg1991xxx -modified stable lung cancer cell lines
h23sir1 was generated by stable transfection of nci- xxxd1322xxx  with a
psuper-sirrm1 construct. to generate this construct, the psuper-gfp/
neo vector (oligoengine, seattle, wa) was digested with bgiii and hindii and
the annealed oligonucleotides (5⬘-gatccccgacgctagagcggtcttatt
tcaagagaataagaccgctctagcgtctttttggaaa-3⬘and 5⬘-agctt
ttccaaaaagacgctagagcggtcttattctcttgaaataagaccgct
ctagcgtcggg-3⬘) were ligated into the vector. the 19-nucleotide  xxxg1991xxx 
target sequences are underlined. the h23sict cell line was generated with the
targeting sequence gctaatagcgcggagtctt, which has no similarity to
any known gene.  xxxd1322xxx -r1 is a stable  xxxg1991xxx  overexpressing cell line, and
 xxxd1322xxx -ct is its corresponding control. both were generated by transfection with
full-length  xxxg1991xxx  cdna cloned into the expression plasmid pcmv-tag2
(stratagene, la jolla, ca) as previously described.22 the level of  xxxg1991xxx  expression in these cell lines was assessed at the rna level by real-time quantitative
reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (rt-pcr) using customdesigned and validated primers and probes and at the protein level by western
blot analysis.23
in vitro drug testing
a modified mtt assay with 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2h-tetrazolium as the reagent
was used, mts assay (promega, madison, wi). it was performed by seeding
4,000 cells/well in 96-well flat bottom plates.  xxxd1322xxx -ct,  xxxd1322xxx -r1, h23sir1, and
h23sict cells were continuously exposed to drug for 72 or 96 hours. after 3
hours of incubation at 37°c, the absorbance was measured at 490 nm in a
microplate reader (benchmark plus; bio-rad, hercules, ca). all experiments
were repeated three times. the in vitro drug concentration that inhibited cell
growth by 50% (ic50) was calculated as ([mean absorbance in triplicate wells
containing the drug ⫺ mean absorbance in triplicate blank wells]/[mean
absorbance in triplicate drug-free wells ⫺ mean absorbance in triplicate blank
wells])⫻100.
to determine drug-induced in vitro apoptosis, 3⫻105 cells/well were
seeded in six well plates and allowed to attach overnight. chemotherapeutic
agents were added to the culture at the indicated concentrations. after 2, 4, and
6 hours of treatment,  xxxg166xxx  labeling of the cells was performed as recommended by the manufacturer (bd pharmingen, san diego, ca). the percentage of labeled cells was determined by flow cytometry (facscalibur, becton
dickinson, franklin lakes, nj).
clinical trial
a trial was designed to prospectively assess the impact of tumoral  xxxg1991xxx 
expression on efficacy of  xxxd2188xxx -based chemotherapy in previously untreated patients with nsclc. a secondary trial end point was to determine the
impact of tumoral  xxxg724xxx  (excision repair cross-complementing gene) ex-

pression on treatment efficacy. for this, we determined the response to  xxxd2188xxx  and carboplatin as induction therapy (indgc) in patients with locally
advanced and inoperable nsclc. double agent chemotherapy was chosen
because single-agent therapy is deemed inadequate for previously untreated
patients with any stage of nsclc and a performance status of 0 to 1.24 trial
eligibility included histologically confirmed nsclc, inoperable stage iiia or
iiib disease (patients with cytologically positive pleural effusion were excluded; and exemption was made for one patient with stage iib disease),
measurable disease by response evaluation criteria in solid tumors
(recist),25 no prior systemic chemotherapy or thoracic radiation, eastern
cooperative oncology group performance status 0 or 1, absence of weight loss
(ⱕ 5% in the 3 months preceding diagnosis), and adequate bone marrow,
liver, and kidney function. all patients were staged with computed tomography (ct) of the chest and upper abdomen, whole body [18f]fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (pet), and magnetic resonance imaging
of the brain. indgc consisted of two 28-day cycles of  xxxd2188xxx , 1,000
mg/m2, given on days 1 and 8 and carboplatin, area under the curve 5, given on
day 1. ct and pet were repeated in week 8, and disease response was assessed.
thereafter, patients received concurrent radiation and chemotherapy for definitive treatment of their disease. the study required the collection of tumor
specimens specifically for molecular analyses before therapy, which was performed by core needle biopsy that produced a tissue specimen of 0.8 mm
diameter. specimens were immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen, embedded in
oct, and processed as frozen sections. tumor cells were collected by laser
capture microdissection (lcm), and rna was extracted. the institutional
review board approved the clinical trial and all patients provided written
informed consent.
disease response assessment
for disease response determination all measurable cancer lesions were
assessed in greatest diameter using images obtained with intravenous contrast
on a multichannel helical ct scanner at 5 mm intervals. measurements were
performed on a picture-archive communication system workstation (siemens
magicview 1000, munich, germany), and they were repeated in week 8. the
percentage of change of the sum of tumor diameters comparing the posttreatment with the pretreatment measurements was calculated using the formula 1⫺(sumctpost/sumctpre). a positive value indicated tumor
shrinkage and a negative value tumor growth (ie, disease response was assessed
as a continuous variable). in addition, disease response was assessed as a
discrete variable using recist (ie, complete remission [cr], partial remission
[pr], stable disease [sd], and progressive disease). the appearance of a new
and previously not observed tumor lesion on imaging studies, which included
a repeat pet scan in week 8, or by physical exam was coded as disease
progression.
gene expression analysis
frozen tissue samples, embedded in oct, were cut in 5 to 7 ␮m sections.
tumor cells were collected by lcm using the arcturus system (60 mw, 1.5
milliseconds, intensity 100, spot size ⬇20 ␮m), and total rna was extracted
using a commercially available method (picopure rna isolation kit,
#kit0204; arcturus, mountain view, ca). complementary dna was generated with superscript ii and oligo-dt (invitrogen, carlsbad, ca). real-time

 xxxg1991xxx  and  xxxd2188xxx  efficacy in nsclc

fig 1. in vitro cytotoxicity of  xxxd2188xxx 
and cisplatin in  xxxd1322xxx -r1,  xxxd1322xxx -ct, h23sir1,
and h23sict. cells were exposed to various drug concentrations for 72 hours, and
viability was subsequently determined by
mts assays (promega, madison, wi). data
are means with or without se from three
independent experiments.

quantitative rt-pcr gene analysis was performed in triplicate per sample and
gene in 96-well plates (abi prism 7700; perkin-elmer, foster city, ca). each
plate contained a serial dilution of reference cdna for standard curve determination and negative controls without template. we had designed and validated the primers and probes as previously described.23,26 commercially
available primers and probes were used for expression analysis of the housekeeping gene 18srrna (perkin-elmer, #4310893e-0203015), which was used
as internal reference standard. the relative amount of target rna in a sample
was determined by comparing the threshold cycle with the standard curve, and
the standardized amount was then determined by dividing the target amount
by the 18srrna amount.
statistical methods
correlation coefficients between gene expression and the continuous
variables tumor response, number of cells collected by lcm, and patients’ age
were calculated according to spearman. the wilcoxon rank sum test was used
to test for significance between dichotomous variables and gene expression.
the kuskal wallis test was used to test for significance between noncontinuous
variables with more than two values and gene expression.

results

we used a modified mtt assay to assess the impact of  xxxg1991xxx  expression on therapeutic efficacy of  xxxd2188xxx  and platinum analogs in
vitro.  xxxd1322xxx , originating from a lung adenocarcinoma, was used as the
parent cell line.27  xxxd1322xxx -r1 had a 2.5- to 3.5-fold increased  xxxg1991xxx 
expression compared with  xxxd1322xxx .22 h23sir1 had a five-fold reduced
 xxxg1991xxx  expression. the expression levels of  xxxg1991xxx  and control genes
were determined by real-time quantitative rt-pcr and western blotting. the expression of  xxxg1992xxx , the catalytic ribonucleotide reductase
subunit, was unaffected. the sensitivity of these cell lines to  xxxd2188xxx , cisplatin, and carboplatin was compared with transfected control
cell lines ( xxxd1322xxx -ct and h23sict). the results are summarized in table

 xxxd2188xxx  (fig 1). the  xxxd2188xxx  ic50 of h23sir1 was 10-fold
lower than the ic50 of h23sict. the response of the parental cell line
( xxxd1322xxx ) to  xxxd2188xxx  was similar to the response of  xxxd1322xxx -ct and
h23sict. there was a similar relationship between  xxxg1991xxx  expression
and cytotoxicity response to cisplatin (fig 1 and table 1) and carboplatin albeit to a lesser degree.  xxxd1322xxx -r1 was 1.2- to 1.5-fold more
resistant and h23sir1 was 1.1- to 1.3-fold more sensitive to platinum
analogs than the corresponding control cell lines.
 xxxg166xxx  labeling was used to assess the proportion of apoptotic cells after drug exposure. we found an inverse relationship between
drug-induced cell death and  xxxg1991xxx  expression (fig 2), which is consistent with the results obtained in the mts assay. the proportion of
cells labeled after 6 hours of treatment with 250 nmol/l  xxxd2188xxx 
was 6.6 to 6.9% in control cell lines, 2.6% in  xxxd1322xxx -r1, and 15.2% in
h23sir1. cisplatin exposure for 6 hours at 200 nmol/l yielded 14.5%
to 15.1% apoptotic cells in  xxxd1322xxx -ct and h23sict, 5.5% apoptotic cells
in  xxxd1322xxx -r1, and 19.0% apoptotic cells in h23sir1.
to prospectively address the hypothesis that intratumoral  xxxg1991xxx 
expression is predictive of response to  xxxd2188xxx -based chemotherapy, we conducted a clinical trial in patients with locally advanced
nsclc. tumor sampling for determination of gene expression before
therapy was required in all patients. they were treated with two cycles
of  xxxd2188xxx  and carboplatin (indgc). unidimensional tumor
measurements were obtained before and after chemotherapy, and
disease response was recorded as the percent change after treatment
compared with before treatment and also categorized as cr, pr, sd,
and progressive disease according to recist.
between november 2003 and january 2006, 40 eligible patients
were enrolled, and the required tumor biopsies were obtained from
all. three patients withdrew consent before initiation of therapy because they desired treatment closer to home. in 28 patients, the biopsies were done to obtain tissue for molecular studies only; in nine
patients, they were also used to establish a diagnosis. in one patient, a
pneumothorax developed that required chest tube placement. in two
patients tumor collection did not yield sufficient material for gene
expression analysis. from the remaining 35 patients, between 30 and
4,500 tumor cells were collected by lcm. all 35 patients completed
indgc, and disease response ranged from a 9% increase to a 100%
decrease in tumor diameters. twenty patients had sd, fourteen had
pr, and one had cr. the patients’ ages ranged from 47 to 87 years; 17
were women; 18 had stage iiia, 16 had stage iiib, and one had stage
iib disease; 11 had squamous cell carcinoma, 11 had adenocarcinoma,
and 13 had large cell carcinoma or unspecified nsclc. two patients
had been life-time never smokers, 20 had quit smoking for 1 to 46
years, and 13 were current smokers.
 xxxg1991xxx  expression ranged from 0.18 to 129.3. we found a significant (p ⫽ .002) inverse correlation (r ⫽ ⫺0.498, spearman correlation coefficient) between  xxxg1991xxx  expression and the magnitude of
disease response (fig 3). when grouping patients into those with
response (cr/pr) and without response (sd),  xxxg1991xxx  expression
was significantly associated with response (p ⫽ .03, ␹2 test), where
patients with high tumoral expression of  xxxg1991xxx  were less likely to
respond to indgc than those with low levels of expression.  xxxg724xxx 
expression was determined as a secondary trial end point, and it was
also inversely correlated (r ⫽ ⫺0.283; p ⫽ .099) with the magnitude of
response but not with the response classification (p ⫽ .32) to indgc.
results are summarized in table 2. there was no significant association between  xxxg1991xxx  or  xxxg724xxx  expression and the number of tumor

discussion

 xxxd2188xxx  is activated in cells by nucleoside kinases to  xxxd2188xxx 
diphosphate (dfdcdp) and  xxxd2188xxx  triphosphate (dfdctp).
the cytotoxic effect of  xxxd2188xxx  has been attributed to a combination of two actions that lead to inhibition of dna synthesis and
subsequent apoptosis. first,  xxxd2188xxx  diphosphate inhibits ribonucleotide reductase, which is responsible for catalyzing the reactions
that generate the deoxynucleotides required for dna synthesis and
repair. then,  xxxd2188xxx  triphosphate competes with dctp for
incorporation into dna during replication, which results in a termination of chain elongation.

 xxxd2188xxx  efficacy is thought to be a function of proteins
involved in activation, metabolism, and transport of the drug.  xxxg611xxx  is required for phosphorylation of  xxxd2188xxx  to its
active metabolite, and low levels have been associated with drug resistance.28 high levels of  xxxg400xxx  inactivate  xxxd2188xxx 
and confer resistance to the drug.29 equilibration-sensitive nucleoside transporter 1 facilitates intracellular  xxxd2188xxx  update, and
deficiency has been associated with drug resistance.30 finally 5⬘
nucleotidase dephosphorylates dfdcmp thus antagonizing the production of active dfdctp. high levels of this enzyme have been found
in  xxxd2188xxx  resistant cell lines; and in patients with acute myelogenous leukemia receiving  xxxd2188xxx , high 5nt expression was associated with poor survival.
a recent report suggested that  xxxd2188xxx  resistance, generated
in vitro through exposure of two nsclc cell lines (h358 and h460)
to increasing concentrations of the drug, was primarily a function of
increased expression of  xxxg1991xxx .20 these data were confirmed in a
subcutaneous murine colon tumor model (colon 26) where  xxxd2188xxx  resistance had been generated through prolonged  xxxd2188xxx 
exposure and serial transplantation.31 however, induction of drug
resistance through continuous exposure results in alterations in multiple genes as demonstrated by these authors. thus, our results in
genetically modified lung cancer cell lines are the first to demonstrate
directly that  xxxg1991xxx  is a major cellular determinant of cytotoxic efficacy
of  xxxd2188xxx . in addition our data demonstrate that  xxxg1991xxx  is a
minor determinant of platinum efficacy.
we confirmed these in vitro data by demonstrating a statistically significant inverse correlation between the magnitude of
change in tumor diameter and  xxxg1991xxx  expression in patients with
nsclc that received  xxxd2188xxx  and carboplatin as first-line
therapy. in addition, we found a similar but less striking relationship between  xxxg724xxx  expression and tumor response. although
previous retrospective studies had suggested this relationship for

both molecules by demonstrating better patient survival in those
having low  xxxg1991xxx  or  xxxg724xxx  expression as compared with high
levels of expression if treated with  xxxd2188xxx  and platinum,21,32 a
direct and prospective demonstration had not been performed.
thus, our results strongly support the primary study hypothesis that  xxxg1991xxx  expression is predictive of response to treatment
with  xxxd2188xxx .
in summary, the cumulative body of indirect and direct in vitro
data and murine and human investigations provide convincing support for  xxxg1991xxx  as the major determinant of  xxxd2188xxx  efficacy.
several issues should be addressed to facilitate implementation of
 xxxg1991xxx  gene expression analysis into patient management. first, it is
important to verify our prospective clinical results in a second prospective treatment trial and to assess if  xxxg1991xxx  and  xxxg724xxx  expression
are similar among a wider spectrum of disease stages. second, for
clinical management of patients a categorization with defined cutoff
levels for  xxxg1991xxx  and perhaps  xxxg724xxx  would be desirable to obtain clear
positive and negative predictive values. for instance, our data suggest
that none of the patients with  xxxg1991xxx  expression above 10 achieved a
pr (0 of 11; positive predictive value for resistance, 1.0), while 15 of 24
patients with levels below 10 had an objective disease response (positive predictive value for sensitivity, 0.6). third, the general feasibility of
performing core needle biopsies of patients’ tumors with immediate
freezing, lcm, and subsequent sophisticated gene expression analysis
appears limited given the required infrastructure. thus, the development of a more generally applicable methodology based on technology familiar to clinical laboratories and pathologists, such as
immunocytochemistry, is desirable. fourth, it is likely that other molecular characteristics of tumor cells and the host significantly impact
the  xxxg1991xxx -affected treatment response. it is thus important to further
elucidate specific molecular features and pathways that modulate
therapeutic efficacy to the agents used for lung cancer therapy.

glossary

 xxxg166xxx  labeling:  xxxg166xxx  is used as a probe in an
affinity assay to detect cells that have expressed phosphatidylserine on the cell surface.

 xxxg1991xxx  (ribonucleotide reductase): a gene that encodes the

 xxxg724xxx  (excision repair cross-complementing
gene): encodes a nucleotide excision repair protein that repairs

rt-pcr (reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction): pcr is a method that allows logarithmic amplification of short

a range of lesions, including uv-induced thymine dimers and
other photoproducts, and also lesions caused by a variety of
chemical agents.

mtt assay: a laboratory test that measures cell growth.

regulatory subunit of ribonucleotide reductase and is a molecular target
of  xxxd2188xxx .

dna sequences within a longer, double-stranded dna molecule. gene
expression can be measured after extraction of total rna and preparation of cdna by a reverse-transcription step. thus, rt-pcr enables the
detection of pcr products on a real-time basis, making it a sensitive
technique for quantitating changes in gene expression.
