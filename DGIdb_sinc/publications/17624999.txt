alcoholism: clinical and experimental research

drug challenges reveal differences in mediation
of stress facilitation of voluntary alcohol
drinking and withdrawal-induced anxiety
in alcohol-preferring p rats
david h. overstreet, darin j. knapp, and george r. breese

background: there is controversy over whether exposure to stress precipitates relapse and ⁄ or
increases alcohol (ethanol) intake. our laboratory has demonstrated that repeated stress prior to
withdrawal from a brief forced exposure to alcohol results in withdrawal-induced anxiety-like
behavior. because anxiety is often regarded as a precipitating factor in relapsing alcoholics, we
decided to examine the consequences of stressing alcohol-preferring p rats on both voluntary
alcohol drinking and withdrawal-induced anxiety.
methods: p rats were subjected to 3 cycles of 5 days of voluntary alcohol drinking and 2 days
of deprivation. restraint stress (60 min) was applied to some animals during the ﬁrst and second
deprivations ⁄ withdrawals (at 4 h). drugs (ﬂumazenil, buspirone, sb242,084, cp154,526,
cra1000, naloxone, haloperidol, olanzapine, naloxone, and haloperidol) were given to some rats
30 min prior to restraint stress.
results: stressed, deprived p rats exhibited both a longer duration of elevated alcohol drinking
and anxiety-like behavior in the social interaction test upon withdrawal after the third cycle of voluntary alcohol drinking. when given prior to each of the restraint stresses, the benzodiazepine
receptor antagonist ﬂumazenil (5 mg ⁄ kg), the  xxxd1752xxx  releasing factor receptor antagonists
cra1000 (3 mg ⁄ kg) and cp154,526 (10 mg ⁄ kg), the serotonin  xxxg1108xxx  partial agonist
buspirone (0.6 mg ⁄ kg), and the mixed 5-ht2c ⁄  xxxg656xxx  antagonist olanzapine were effective in
reducing the increased duration of elevated alcohol drinking and the withdrawal-induced anxietylike behavior. in contrast, while the opiate receptor antagonist naloxone (20 mg ⁄ kg), the 5-ht2c
receptor antagonist sb242084 (3 mg ⁄ kg), and the dopamine receptor antagonist haloperidol
(0.1 mg ⁄ kg) also reduced drinking, they did not signiﬁcantly alter anxiety like behavior.
conclusion: these results suggest that stress-induced facilitation of alcohol drinking and withdrawal-induced anxiety-like behavior in p rats may be closely but imperfectly linked.
key words: alcohol-preferring p rats, restraint stress, voluntary alcohol drinking, alcohol

tress has been implicated in precipitating relapse
in alcoholics (breese et al., 2005; sinha, 2001), but the
relationship between stress and alcohol intake in both animals
and humans has been and remains controversial (e.g., champagne and kirouac, 1987; lynch et al., 1999; pohorecky,
1990, 1991) despite the apparent simplicity of the tension
reduction hypothesis (e.g., kalodner et al., 1989; young
et al., 1990). some of these discrepancies may relate to differences in animal strains, types of stressors, or other procedural

variables. for example, lynch et al. (1999) reported that
restraint stress resulted in increased voluntary alcohol consumption in wistar rats, while chester et al., 2004) reported a
decrease in voluntary alcohol drinking in the alcohol-preferring p rats or the high alcohol drinking (had) rats during
the application of stress. both groups reported increased
drinking after termination of stress (chester et al., 2004;
lynch et al., 1999). thus, stress may have biphasic effects on
alcohol intake depending upon the time at which measurements are made.
footshock-induced stress resulted in a reduction in alcohol
drinking in adolescent sprague–dawley (sd) rats (brunell
and spear, 2005), but increased alcohol intake in a variety of
alcohol-preferring rat lines, including the alcohol-preferring
(p) and had rats (vengeliene et al., 2003). on the other
hand, repeated swim stress increased alcohol intake only in
wistar rats, not the alcohol-preferring rat lines (vengeliene
et al., 2003). of particular relevance to the present study is the
report by funk et al. (2004). they applied repeated footshock
1473

or social defeat during 2-week deprivation periods and reported that the elevated alcohol drinking associated with the
alcohol-deprivation effect (ade) was enhanced in the stress
groups. the present study shows that acute restraint stress
during withdrawal from alcohol can have a similar effect in p
rats.
stress has also been implicated in the induction of anxietylike behavior (breese et al., 2004; valdez et al., 2002). indeed,
it has been shown that exposure to restraint stress for 60 min
is comparable to an episode of withdrawal from 5 days
exposure to alcohol, with both procedures sensitizing rats to
the anxiety-like behavior observed during withdrawal from a
ﬁnal episode of alcohol exposure (breese et al., 2004; overstreet et al., 2002). these studies have been carried out in sd
rats on a forced alcohol diet. because these rats do not drink
substantial amounts of alcohol voluntarily, it was not possible
to explore the relationship between stress, voluntary alcohol
drinking, and subsequent withdrawal-induced anxiety-like behavior. by using a modiﬁed repeated withdrawal protocol
(overstreet et al., 2002, 2003, 2004) in the alcohol-preferring
p rats, it was possible to explore the relationship between
these variables, as reported in the current communication and
described brieﬂy in a previous report (breese et al., 2004).
another well-characterized phenomenon in the p rat is the
ade, where the rats exhibit increased drinking of and preference for alcohol following a period of deprivation (holter
et al., 1998; mckinzie et al., 1998; rodd-henricks et al.,
2000a,b; sinclair and li, 1989; spanagel and holter, 1999,
2000). these studies often employ long-term exposure to water
and alcohol solutions and have relatively long (2 weeks) deprivation periods. the present communication includes p rats
that have been subjected to quite brief (5-day) exposures to
water and alcohol and even briefer (2 days) deprivation (withdrawal) periods. the elevated alcohol intake and withdrawalinduced anxiety under these conditions are quite remarkable
(see breese et al., 2004). while others have reported both an
increase in alcohol drinking and anxiety-like behavior in outbred rats, the rats had access to alcohol for nearly 1 year (holter et al., 1998; spanagel and holter, 1999), not just 15 days.
the increase in withdrawal-induced anxiety-like behavior
in sd rats has been blocked or reduced by treatments with
speciﬁc pharmacological actions during the early withdrawal
periods (breese et al., 2004; knapp et al., 2005; overstreet
et al., 2003, 2004) despite the fact that the drug treatments
were given nearly a week before the behavioral test. among
the compounds that counteracted the withdrawal-induced
anxiety were ﬂumazenil, a benzodiazepine ( xxxd1459xxx ) receptor
antagonist, buspirone, a  xxxg1108xxx  partial agonist, and
cp154,526, a  xxxg517xxx  type 1 (crf1)
receptor antagonist. these compounds were, therefore, examined in the p rats subjected to multiple cycles of alcohol exposure and withdrawal ⁄ deprivation and stress. in addition, the
following drugs known to affect alcohol intake or the ade
were tested: naloxone, an opiate receptor antagonist, reduces
alcohol intake (overstreet et al., 1999), while haloperidol, a
dopamine receptor antagonist, reduces the ade (salimov

overstreet et al.

et al., 2000) and olanzapine, an atypical antipsychotic that
blocks both dopamine and serotonin receptors, reduces alcohol consumption and craving in humans (hutchison et al.,
2006). the ﬁndings of this study, which greatly extend the
results previously reported (breese et al., 2004), suggest a close
but imperfect link between the elevated voluntary drinking
induced by stress and the withdrawal-induced anxiety-like
behavior.
methods
animals
the alcohol-preferring p rats were selected from the breeding colonies in the bowles center for alcohol studies at an initial weight of
about 180 g (50 days of age). they were initially housed in groups of
4 to adapt them to the experimental treatment room maintained at
50% humidity, 22c and a reversed light:dark cycle (lights off from
1000 to 2200). after the 1-week adaptation period, the rats were
transferred to special plastic cages ﬁtted with 2 holes for the placement of calibrated drinking tubes (dyets, inc., bethlehem, pa). rats
had free access to food throughout the study, but their access to ﬂuids was restricted according to the research design, as described
below. rats assigned to the various groups gained weight at comparable rates.
research design
the experiment was divided into 4 primary treatment groups:
group 1 had access to water only throughout the study and served
as the control group. group 2 was adapted to drink alcohol voluntarily and was then provided with continuous, simultaneous access to
water and 10% alcohol solution. this group served as a control for
the length of exposure to alcohol in the groups that were cycled.
group 3 was adapted to drink alcohol voluntarily and then subjected
to 3 cycles of 5 days’ exposure to a choice between tap water and
10% alcohol. two 2-day periods of deprivation ⁄ withdrawal were
interposed after the ﬁrst and second cycles. group 4 was adapted to
drink alcohol voluntarily and then was subjected to the same conditions as group 3, with an additional variable. at 4 h into the ﬁrst
and second withdrawals, these rats were subjected to restraint stress
for 1 h. group 4 rats were also divided into multiple subgroups
based upon drug treatments that they received 30 min prior to the
application of restraint stress during the ﬁrst and second deprivation ⁄ withdrawal periods. figure 1 illustrates the important aspects of
this design.
several (2 to 4) rats from groups 1 to 3 were tested simultaneously
with each group of drug-treated rats in group 4, so there were larger
sample sizes in these groups at the end of the study: 18 in group 1,
24 in group 2, and 20 in group 3, while the individual subgroups of
drug-treated rats contained 7 to 10 rats.
two-bottle choice
the two-bottle choice design for access to alcohol has been
routinely used in our laboratory (e.g., overstreet et al., 1997;

fig. 1. research design for drug treatment and stress application in p
rats repeatedly withdrawn from alcohol.

restraint stress, anxiety, and alcohol drinking in p rats

1475

kampov-polevoy et al., 2000). the rats are adapted to the procedure
by giving them 1 day of access to water only and 3 days of access to
alcohol (10%, v ⁄ v) only. then the choice between water and alcohol
began and was present for 15 days. some rats were on the choice
procedure for 15 consecutive days while others received 3 cycles of
5 days’ exposure. during the deprivation ⁄ withdrawal periods these
cycled rats had access to water only.

anova and tukey’s protected t-tests. measures from the social
interaction test (seconds spent in social interaction and line crosses)
were also analyzed by one-way anova and tukey’s tests. signiﬁcance was set at p < 0.05.

drug treatments
the following drug treatments were given:
1. flumazenil (5 mg ⁄ kg), a  xxxd1459xxx  antagonist, was given because it
prevents anxiety-like behavior in rats subjected to repeated withdrawals (knapp et al., 2005) and stress (breese et al., 2004).
2. cra1000 (3 mg ⁄ kg) and cp154,526 (10 mg ⁄ kg), crf1 receptor
antagonists, were given because they also have prophylactic
effects against withdrawal- and stress-induced anxiety-like behavior (breese et al., 2004; overstreet et al., 2004).
3. buspirone (0.6 mg ⁄ kg), a  xxxg1108xxx  partial agonist, was
given because it has prophylactic effects against withdrawal- and
stress-induced anxiety-like behavior (breese et al., 2004; overstreet et al., 2003).
4. sb242,084, a  xxxg1115xxx  antagonist, was used because it
prevented withdrawal-induced anxiety-like behavior (overstreet
et al., 2003).
5. naloxone (20 mg ⁄ kg) was used because the opiate antagonists
are widely used to prevent alcohol relapse (e.g, anton et al., 1999)
and reduce alcohol drinking in rodents (e.g., overstreet et al.,
1999).
6. haloperidol (0.1 mg ⁄ kg) was given because salimov et al. (2000)
reported that it prevented the ade in mice.
7. olanzapine (5 mg ⁄ kg) was given because this atypical antipsychotic is an antagonist at both dopamine d2 and 5-ht2c receptors and has been reported to reduce alcohol craving and
consumption in heavy drinkers (hutchison et al., 2001, 2003,
2006).

effects of deprivation and stress

flumazenil, the crf antagonists and sb242,084 were suspended
in carboxymethylcellulose (0.5%), naloxone and buspirone were dissolved in isotonic saline, and haloperidol and olanzapine were dissolved in a small amount of 1 n hcl and the ph adjusted to 5. all
injections were i.p.

results

the effects of 2 periods of 2 days’ alcohol deprivation with
and without restraint stress on subsequent alcohol intake in
the alcohol-preferring p rats are illustrated in fig. 2. as
expected, the rats given continuous access to a choice between
alcohol and water do not increase their alcohol intake, while
the rats subjected to deprivation or deprivation and restraint
stress exhibited short-term increases in alcohol intake
[f(2,21) = 4.50, p = 0.02 for treatment]. the two-way
anova also conﬁrmed that the amount of alcohol intake
was different over days [f(5,105) = 7.45, p < 0.0001]. however, an important aspect of fig. 2 was that the alcohol intake
of the group that received restraint stress during deprivation
had a prolonged increase in alcohol intake during the third
cycle of exposure, a result supported by the signiﬁcant
group · day interaction effect [f(10,105) = 2.31, p < 0.02].
to illustrate this effect more clearly, cumulative alcohol
intake during ﬁrst cycle was subtracted from that for the third
cycle to obtain increase in cumulative alcohol intake. there
were dramatic differences, as described initially and brieﬂy in
breese et al. (2004). the rats that had continuous access to
alcohol exhibited almost no change in drinking, while the
deprived rats exhibited a modest increase and the deprived,
restrained rats exhibited a signiﬁcantly larger increase. alcohol was withdrawn from these groups of rats after their 15th

social interaction test
to obtain an index of anxiety-like behavior during withdrawal
from the third cycle of choice between water and 10% alcohol (or
15th day of exposure), the rats were placed in a social interaction
arena 5 h after removal of alcohol. the arena was 60 · 60 cm, with
sixteen 10 · 10 cm squares marked out on the ﬂoor. rats with similar weights and treatments were placed in the arena and time spent
in social interaction (grooming, snifﬁng, crawling over or under) and
line crosses was recorded during the 5-min session (file and seth,
2003). the scores for individual animals were taken, as previous
reports indicated that analyses of individual scores were similar to
those for pairs (overstreet et al., 2002, 2003).
statistical analysis
the voluntary drinking data was averaged over days for the basic
3 cycles and the data subjected to mixed two-way anovas, with
cycle as the repeated factor and treatment as the independent factor.
if there were signiﬁcant main or interaction effects, follow-up tests
were carried out with tukey’s protected t-tests. for analysis of drug
effects on drinking, the cumulative alcohol intake over the last 5 days
(days 11 to 15) was compared to the amount over the ﬁrst 5 days.
these cumulative alcohol intake data were analyzed by one-way

fig. 2. daily alcohol intake (g ⁄ kg ⁄ d) in p rats continuously exposed to
alcohol, deprived of alcohol, or deprived and stressed. average intake for
the first 5 days is presented as treatment day 0. the data represent the
means ± sem for n = 8 animals in each of the 3 groups. there was a 2-day

session of access to alcohol and water and the social interaction test was carried out to assess anxiety-like behavior.
a group that was maintained on water throughout was
used as a reference control group. as illustrated in the upper
panel of fig. 3, those rats that were subjected to stress during
the 2 deprivation periods exhibited the least amount of
time spent in social interaction, while the rats that had
access to water only exhibited the most. a one-way anova
conﬁrmed that there were signiﬁcant group differences
[f(3,32) = 25.25, p < 0.0001] and tukey’s protected t-tests
established that deprived and stressed group was signiﬁcantly
different from all of the others. importantly, the rats that
were deprived only were not different from the control group
(fig. 3, upper panel. in contrast, there were no differences in
line crosses among the 4 groups [f(3,32) = 1.07, ns], as illustrated in the lower panel of fig. 3. these ﬁndings replicate
those of breese et al., 2004).
thus, restraint stress applied during deprivation from alcohol both increased the amount of alcohol intake during the
third cycle (fig. 2) and induced anxiety-like behavior upon
withdrawal from alcohol (fig. 3). deprivation alone also
increased alcohol drinking somewhat, but did not induce
anxiety-like behavior.

overstreet et al.

drug effects on alcohol drinking
the one-way anova indicated that there were signiﬁcant
differences among the drug-treated rats for increase in cumulative alcohol intake [f(11,145) = 9.45, p < 0.001] and
tukey’s protected t-tests established which groups differed
from each other. because of the large number of drugs tested,
it was decided to present the data in 2 ﬁgures, with the key
control and experimental groups being repeated to permit
easy comparison. as shown in fig. 4, ﬂumazenil, the  xxxd1459xxx 
receptor antagonist, cra1000 and cp154,526, crf1 receptor antagonists, and buspirone,  xxxg1108xxx  partial agonist, all reduced the elevated drinking induced by restraint
stress but only ﬂumazenil and cra1000 also appeared to
reduce the drinking stimulated by deprivation only. the
groups cannot be directly compared statistically because of
multiple differences in treatment, but these 2 groups were not
signiﬁcantly different from the rats  xxxd102xxx  and
water continuously. a similar pattern of effects was seen
(fig. 5) for naloxone, the opiate receptor antagonist,
sb242,084, the  xxxg1115xxx  antagonist, and 5-ht2c and
 xxxg656xxx  antagonist olanzapine (the atypical
antipsychotic). however, haloperidol, the selective dopamine
receptor antagonist, reduced alcohol drinking to a greater
extent, so that the value was not signiﬁcantly different from
that of the rats exposed continuously to alcohol and water.
drug effects on anxiety-like behavior
a one-way anova comparing all 13 experimental groups
revealed signiﬁcant differences for time spent in social interaction, an index of anxiety-like behavior [f(12,155) = 11.08,
p < 0.0001]. as was found above (fig. 3), the rats subjected
to both deprivation and restraint stress exhibited the lowest
amount of time spent in social interaction and the rats
exposed to water only exhibited the greatest. the groups that
were continuously exposed to alcohol and water or repeatedly

deprived of alcohol were not signiﬁcantly different from the
control group exposed to water only, as illustrated in fig. 6.
flumazenil, cp154,526, cra1000 and buspirone all completely counteracted the anxiety-like behavior induced by
restraint stress and deprivation, such that their times spent in
social interaction were not signiﬁcantly different from the
control rats exposed only to water. in contrast, as illustrated
in fig. 7, naloxone, sb242,084, and haloperidol failed to
counteract the anxiety-like behavior at all, while olanzapine
was effective.
the effects of the drug treatments on locomotor activity
were quite different from their effects on time spent in social
interaction. although there were signiﬁcant group differences
[f(12,155) = 3.96, p < 0.001], almost all treatments were
not signiﬁcantly different from the control group or from

each other. virtually all of the signiﬁcance could be attributed
to the fact that rats given cp154,526 or olanzapine were
about 40% more active (148 ± 6 and 141 ± 8 lines crossed,
respectively) than the other groups (about 110 ± 7).
discussion
neither the rats continuously exposed to alcohol and
water nor those repeatedly deprived of alcohol spent less
time in social interaction than the rats exposed to water
only. thus, p rats that are exposed to alcohol voluntarily
for 15 days do not exhibit anxiety-like behavior upon withdrawal. this ﬁnding is consistent with a previous report
indicating that anxiety-like behavior and seizure susceptibility can be observed in p rats after 6 weeks of voluntary
drinking but not after 2 or 4 weeks (kampov-polevoy
et al., 2000). the likely reason for the rats in this study to
exhibit normal behavior is that their alcohol intakes (4 to
6 g ⁄ kg) are much lower than those of rats exposed to alcohol (8 to 13 g ⁄ kg) in liquid diets (breese et al., 2004; overstreet et al., 2002, 2003, 2005).
the data for time spent in social interaction in the
untreated p rats provide support for a key role of stress as a
risk factor for anxiety-like behavior during alcohol withdrawal. it must be emphasized that the restraint stress was
employed twice, 7 and 14 days prior to the conduct of the
social interaction test. the fact that the deprived rats that
were stressed exhibited signiﬁcantly lower time spent in social
interaction conﬁrms our previous ﬁnding in sd rats that were
forced to drink alcohol in a liquid diet (breese et al., 2004).
however, these p rats were drinking the alcohol voluntarily
and their alcohol intakes (4 to 6 g ⁄ kg) were substantially
lower than those of the sd rats maintained on forced 4.5 (8
to 10 g ⁄ kg) or 7% (11 to 13 g ⁄ kg) alcohol diets. even the
alcohol intake obtained on the ﬁrst day of the third cycle
(fig. 2) is less than the level normally obtained by rats forced

1478

to drink alcohol in liquid diets or in p rats maintained on 2
bottle choice for long periods (kampov-polevoy et al., 2000).
therefore, the increased anxiety-like behavior of the stressed
and deprived rats cannot be due exclusively to the fact that
they drink more alcohol than the rats that were continuously
exposed to alcohol and water or were repeatedly deprived of
alcohol.
these experiments also conﬁrm the existence of an ade in
the alcohol-preferring p rats. although the increase in alcohol
intake after a period of deprivation has been observed on
numerous occasions by others (holter et al., 1998; mckinzie
et al., 1998; rodd-henricks et al., 2000a,b; sinclair and li,
1989; vengeliene et al., 2003), they normally use much longer
alcohol exposures (e.g., 2 to 4 weeks) and deprivation (e.g., 1
to 2 weeks) periods. these p rats exhibited small short-term
increases in alcohol intake after only 5 days of exposure to
alcohol and with only a 2-day deprivation period (fig. 2).
when restraint stress was applied to the deprived rats 4 h
after removal of the alcohol during the ﬁrst and second cycles
of deprivation ⁄ withdrawal, there was also a short-term
increase in alcohol intake. this increase was similar in magnitude to that observed for the deprived only group, but the elevated drinking persisted for a longer time (fig. 2). indeed, the
stressed p rats exhibited a pattern of drinking during the third
cycle that was reminiscent of p rats subjected to multiple deprivations (rodd-henricks et al., 2000a,b). to the extent that
this elevated drinking during the ade represents an index of
craving (e.g., mckinzie et al., 1998; spanagel and holter,
1999, 2000) or positive rewarding effects of alcohol (funk
et al., 2004), it may be suggested that restraint stress applied
during alcohol deprivation periods increases craving (see
funk et al., 2004; sinha, 2001).
the present ﬁndings on the facilitated alcohol drinking in
the p rats subjected to restraint stress are consistent with
much of the previous literature on stress and alcohol drinking.
although chester et al. (2004) and lynch et al. (1999) reported opposite changes in drinking during the application of
stress, both reported increases in drinking after termination of
stress. access to alcohol in this study began approximately
48 h after termination of the stress. funk et al. (2004) also
reported an increase in the ade when stressors were applied
during the deprivation period. in addition, they reported that
the aversive effects of alcohol, as assessed by place conditioning, was reduced by the application of stress. however, few
investigators examined the possibility of withdrawal-induced
anxiety in their stress-treated rats. the one study that looked
for withdrawal effects did not see them in adolescent rats
whose alcohol drinking was increased by stress (brunell and
spear, 2005).
thus, restraint stress in alcohol-deprived p rats both
increased the duration of the elevated drinking and induced
anxiety-like behavior upon the ﬁnal withdrawal from alcohol
at the end. whether these 2 effects represent separate
phenomena controlled by independent mechanisms or are
mutually controlled by the same mechanisms cannot be determined on the basis of these data alone. however, the present

overstreet et al.

experiments included a variety of pharmacological treatments
that will permit a more deﬁnitive conclusion. before these
individual treatments are discussed, it is important to emphasize the treatment protocol used. the drugs were given
30 min before the application of restraint stress or 3.5 h after
the alcohol was removed at the ﬁrst and second cycles. there
was no drug in the rats when the alcohol intakes or social
interaction behavior were being measured. therefore, any
effects of the drugs on these measures must be due to a
modiﬁcation of an adaptive process that contributes to the
elevated drinking and ⁄ or anxiety-like behavior.
flumazenil, a  xxxd1459xxx  receptor antagonist, the crf1 receptor
antagonists cra1000 and cp154,526, and buspirone, a
5-ht1a partial agonist, have been reported to counteract
alcohol withdrawal-induced anxiety-like behavior when given
shortly before the behavior task (file et al., 1989; knapp
et al., 1998, 2004; moy et al., 1997, 2000), during repeated
withdrawals from alcohol (knapp et al., 2005; overstreet
et al., 2003, 2004, 2006), or prior to repeated stresses (breese
et al., 2004). thus, the fact that the anxiety-like behavior of
the stressed, alcohol-deprived rats is also blocked by these
compounds was expected. however, they also counteracted
the elevation in drinking induced by stress exposure, suggesting that these 2 key behavioral changes may both be mediated, in part, by  xxxd1459xxx , crf1, and  xxxg1108xxx 
mechanisms. there have been previous reports of these compounds suppressing voluntary alcohol intake (june et al.,
1998; lodge and lawrence, 2003; schmitt et al., 2002), but
the designs were quite different from that used in this study.
the fact that all 3 systems ( xxxd1459xxx , crf, and 5-ht1a) counteracted both behaviors supports the contention that the rats
may be  xxxd102xxx  to relieve the anxiety-like behavior
and not because it is intrinsically more rewarding.
before discussing other pharmacological agents, a more
detailed consideration of the effects of ﬂumazenil and the
crf1 receptor antagonist, cra1000, on alcohol drinking
would be informative. as shown in fig. 2 and in other studies, the ade is characterized by an initial elevation of drinking followed by a gradual decline. as shown in fig. 8, neither
ﬂumazenil nor cra1000 have any discernible effect on the
alcohol intake during the ﬁrst day (neither does stress). however, while the stressed, deprived group continues to exhibit
elevated drinking, the rats treated with ﬂumazenil or
cra1000 show a decrease. thus, the drugs counteract the
effects of stress on the duration of drinking, not the effects of
deprivation on the peak drinking.
a consideration of other drug effects suggests that these 2
behaviors may indeed be at least partially mediated by separate neurochemical mechanisms. naloxone, the opiate receptor
antagonist, counteracted the stress-induced increase in alcohol
drinking, but did not affect withdrawal-induced anxiety.
thus, the 2 behaviors can be distinctly modulated.
sb242,084, the 5-ht2c antagonist, produced a pattern similar
to that for naloxone. the failure to block the anxiety-like behavior in the stressed, deprived p rats is consistent with its
lack of effect in preventing the sensitizing effects of stress on

restraint stress, anxiety, and alcohol drinking in p rats

fig. 8. effects of flumazenil and cra1000 on the daily pattern of drinking in stressed, alcohol deprived p rats. rats were subjected to the protocol
illustrated in fig. 1, with flumazenil, and cra1000 being injected 30 min
prior to the application of stress. animals with continuous access to alcohol
and water were compared to: (1) those with cycled exposure to alcohol with
two 2-day deprivation periods interspersed between three 5-day cycles of
exposure to water and alcohol and (2) those with cycled exposure to alcohol
with stress added during the deprivation periods with and without flumazenil
or cra1000.

sd rats exposed to forced alcohol diets (breese et al., 2004).
haloperidol, the  xxxg656xxx  antagonist, was even
more effective in reducing alcohol drinking in the p rats, a
result that supports the ﬁndings of salimov et al. (2000) in
mice. however, haloperidol-treated rats exhibited as much
anxiety-like behavior in the social interaction test as did rats
treated with vehicle. thus, it appears that opioid, 5-ht2c,
and d2 mechanisms are not involved in the anxiety-like
behavior resulting from multiple stresses and deprivations,
but they may contribute to the elevated drinking.
the atypical antispsychotic olanzapine, which blocks both
d2 and 5-ht2c receptors, counteracted the stress-induced elevation in alcohol drinking and anxiety-like behavior even
though the more select compounds, haloperidol and
sb242,084, did not alter the anxiety-like behavior. the reduction in alcohol drinking is consistent with clinical reports that
found that olanzapine reduces craving for alcohol (hutchison
et al., 2001). a recent report suggested that this effect may be
related to the  xxxg658xxx  because it varied with
polymorphic differences in the  xxxg658xxx  and because
 xxxd1785xxx , a 5-ht2c antagonist, did not mimic the
effects of olanzapine (hutchison et al., 2003). more recently
it was shown that olanzapine may also reduce alcohol
consumption (hutchison et al., 2006).
in general, the drugs had little effect on locomotor activity
in the social interaction test, a ﬁnding consistent with the
results from rats repeatedly exposed to alcohol diets and ⁄ or
stresses (breese et al., 2004; knapp et al., 2005; overstreet
et al., 2002, 2003, 2004). however, both olanzapine and

1479

cp154,526 increased locomotor activity. it must be emphasized that the drugs were administered 1 week prior to the behavioral test, so their effects on activity must be the
consequence of an interaction with the adaptive processes
underlying alcohol withdrawal. what these processes are cannot be speciﬁed at this time, particularly since haloperidol,
sb242,084, and cra1000, which share some of the properties of olanzapine and cp154,526, did not affect activity.
an assessment of the utility and validity of this paradigm
can be attempted by comparing the effects of the drugs used
in these experiments with clinical and preclinical reports on
these agents under other conditions. for example, the  xxxd1459xxx 
antagonist ﬂumazenil inhibited both the increased alcohol
drinking and anxiety-like behaviors in the present study and
there are reports that it has both a suppressing effect on
alcohol drinking (june et al., 1998; schmitt et al., 2002) as
well as anxiolytic effects (file et al., 1989; knapp et al.,
1998; moy et al., 1997, 2000). the anxiolytic properties of
crf1 antagonists are also well known (okuyama et al.,
1999; overstreet et al., 2004; seymour et al., 2003) and recent
studies suggest that these antagonists may also reduce alcohol drinking in anxious or alcohol-dependent rats (lodge
and lawrence, 2003; valdez et al., 2002). however, neither
of this class of compound has been used in the treatment of
alcoholics. in contrast, buspirone, a  xxxg1108xxx  partial
agonist, has well-known anxiolytic properties in humans but
a mixed history in treating alcoholics (fawcett et al., 1999;
george et al., 1999; kranzler and meyer, 1992; malcolm
et al., 1992; malec et al., 1996; tollefson et al., 1992). there
is stronger evidence that  xxxg1108xxx  agonists and
 xxxg1115xxx  antagonists reduce alcohol drinking in
animals (hedlund and wahlstrom, 1996; knapp et al., 1993;
mckenzie-quirk and miczek, 2003; tomkins et al., 2002).
although olanzapine has been reported to decrease craving
and alcohol consumption (hutchison et al., 2001, 2003,
2006), the only clinical trial published to date has been
negative (guardia et al., 2004). based upon these observations, it would be unwise to predict that drugs which
reduced both alcohol drinking and anxiety-like behavior in
stressed, deprived p rats will necessarily be useful treatments
for alcoholism.
in conclusion, adding restraint stress to deprivation periods
in p rats having voluntary access to alcohol both increases the
duration of postdeprivation alcohol drinking and decreases
time spent in social interaction behavior. flumazenil, crf1
receptor antagonists, buspirone, and olanzapine reduce the
effects of stress on both alcohol drinking and social interaction. however, naloxone, haloperidol, and sb242,084 affected only the increase in alcohol drinking. these results
suggest that the 2 behaviors are modulated by multiple
systems, some of which are involved in both behaviors.
