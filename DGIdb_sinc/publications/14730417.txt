abstract although many  xxxg836xxx -receptor antagonists and
 xxxg837xxx   xxxg1553xxx   xxxg2356xxx -receptor agonists have been used in pharmacotherapy
for many years their pharmacological properties at all three
known subtypes of beta-adrenergic receptors are not always
well characterized. the aim of this study was, therefore,
to provide comparative binding characteristics of agonists
(epinephrine, norepinephrine,  xxxd2401xxx ,  xxxd2098xxx , salbutamol, salmeterol, terbutalin,  xxxd2155xxx , broxaterol) and
antagonists (propranolol,  xxxd123xxx , atenolol, metoprolol,
bisoprolol, carvedilol,  xxxd2957xxx , brl 37344, cgp 20712,
sr 59230a, cgp 12177, ici 118551) at all three subtypes
of human beta-adrenergic receptors in an identical cellular
background. we generated chinese hamster ovary (cho)
cells stably expressing the three beta-adrenergic receptor subtypes at comparable levels. we characterized these receptor subtypes and analyzed the affinity of routinely used
drugs as well as experimental compounds in competition
binding studies, using the non-selective antagonist 125i-cyanopindolol as a radioligand. furthermore, we analyzed
the beta-receptor-mediated adenylyl cyclase activity in isolated membranes from these cell lines. the results from
our experiments show that all compounds exhibit distinct
patterns of selectivity and activity at the three beta-receptor
subtypes. in particular, a number of  xxxg837xxx   xxxg1553xxx   xxxg2356xxx - or  xxxg838xxx -receptor agonists that are inverse agonists at the other subtypes were
identified. in addition,  xxxg836xxx -receptor antagonists with agonistic activity at  xxxg837xxx   xxxg1553xxx   xxxg2356xxx - and  xxxg838xxx -receptors were found. these
specific mixtures of agonism, antagonism, and inverse agonism at different subtypes may have important implications for the therapeutic use of the respective compounds.

introduction
adrenergic receptors belong to the superfamily of seven
transmembrane spanning proteins that activate heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide binding proteins. the three known
beta-adrenergic receptor subtypes are designated  xxxg836xxx ,  xxxg837xxx   xxxg1553xxx   xxxg2356xxx , and
 xxxg838xxx  and are all positively coupled to adenylyl cyclase. the
 xxxg836xxx -receptor is the predominant subtype in mammalian
heart (brodde 1993) whereas the  xxxg837xxx   xxxg1553xxx   xxxg2356xxx -receptor represents
the predominant subtype in most vascular and bronchial
smooth muscle cells (guimaraes and moura 2001; kotlikoff and kamm 1996). the  xxxg838xxx -subtype is primarily found
in white and brown adipose tissues (krief et al. 1993).
the beta-adrenergic receptors signaling pathways play a key
role in regulating cardiac function (reviewed by brodde
and michel 1999) and beta-adrenergic receptor mediated relaxation of smooth muscles plays an important physiological role in the regulation of vascular and bronchial tone
(reviewed by guimaraes and moura 2001; kotlikoff and
kamm 1996). these findings have led to the development
of a large number of compounds modulating the activity
of beta-adrenergic receptors for the clinical treatment of diseases including hypertension, heart failure (reviewed by
berkin and ball 2001; krum 2003) and asthma (waldeck
2002). the pharmacological characteristics of  xxxg836xxx -receptors
and  xxxg837xxx   xxxg1553xxx   xxxg2356xxx -receptors have been studied exhaustively, and a large
number of clinically relevant agonists and antagonists have
been characterized in competition binding and functional
studies. however, this information is spread over a vast
number of studies and derived from different organ preparations and different species (michel 1991). therefore, a
direct comparison of such data is often difficult and possibly not relevant for the human receptor subtypes. after
the cloning of the human beta-receptor subtypes their stable
expression in eukaryotic expression systems like chinese
hamster ovary (cho) cells became possible (tate et al.

152

1991). however, detailed studies with such human receptor models typically focused on the characterization of single receptor subtypes (liggett 1992; lattion et al. 1999;
candelore et al. 1999; del carmine et al. 2002).
in spite of the fact that a large number of beta-receptor agonists and antagonists have been in clinical use for decades
there is a lack of comparative pharmacological data about
their affinity, subtype selectivity and efficacy at the human receptor subtypes. such data appear to be important
to better understand the potential clinical benefits and
risks of individual compounds. the  xxxg837xxx   xxxg1553xxx   xxxg2356xxx -selectivity of beta-agonists in the treatment of asthma, for instance, is a critical
determinant of the risk for cardiac side effects. in an in
vitro study of the so-called  xxxg837xxx   xxxg1553xxx   xxxg2356xxx -selective agonist broxaterol,
which is not in clinical use, we discovered that this compound binds to  xxxg836xxx -and  xxxg837xxx   xxxg1553xxx   xxxg2356xxx -receptors with similar affinity
(conti et al. 1998). however, it turned out that it exhibits
agonistic activity at the  xxxg837xxx   xxxg1553xxx   xxxg2356xxx -subtype only whereas it was an
antagonist at  xxxg836xxx -receptors (conti et al. 1998), which makes
it a functionally selective compound. in order to provide
similar information for the characteristics of relevant
compounds acting at beta-receptors we have now compared
the detailed pharmacological characteristics of a number
of clinically and experimentally relevant compounds on
all three human beta-adrenergic receptor subtypes under carefully standardized conditions in an identical cellular background.

materials and methods
materials. (-)-epinephrine, (-)-norepinephrine, cgp-20712 ((±)-2hydroxy-5-[2-[[2-hydroxy3-[4-[1-methyl-4-(trifluoromethyl)-1himidazol-2-yl]phenoxy]propyl]amino]ethoxy]-benzamide), (-)- xxxd2401xxx , metoprolol, propranolol, and terbutaline were purchased from sigma (taufkirchen, germany). atenolol, bisoprolol,
brl-37344 ((r*,r*)-(±)-4-[2-[(2-(3-chlorophenyl)-2-hydroxyethyl)
amino]propyl]phenoxyacetic acid), cgp-12177 (4-[3-[(1,1-dimethylethyl)amino]2-hydroxypropoxy]-1,3-dihydro-2h-benzimidazol2-one)), sr 59230a (1-(2-ethylphenoxy)-3-[[(1s)-1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-1-naphthalenyl]amino]-(2s)- xxxd2400xxx ),  xxxd2957xxx ,  xxxd2155xxx 
and salbutamol were purchased from tocris/biotrend (cologne,
germany). the sources of further compounds were: carvedilol
(boehringer mannheim, mannheim, germany);  xxxd2098xxx , icn
(eschwege, germany);  xxxd123xxx , astra (wedel, germany); ici118551 ((±)-1-[2,3-(dihydro-7-methyl-1h-inden-4-yl)oxy]-3-[(1methylethyl)amino]-2-butanol), rbi/sigma (taufkirchen, germany). salmeterol was kindly provided by dr. h. krohn (glaxosmithkline, bad oldeslohe, germany). broxaterol was kindly synthesized by prof. m. de amici (istituto di chimica farmaceutica e
tossicologica, università degli studi di milano, italy). (-)-3-125i-iodocyanopindolol (125i-cyp) was from amersham biosciences (freiburg, germany; specific activity, 2,200 ci/mmol). [alpha-32p]atp was
from perkinelmer lifescience (rodgau-jügesheim, germany). cell
culture media and fetal calf serum were from pansystems (aidenbach, germany), penicillin (100 u/ml), streptomycin (100 µg/ml),
l-glutamine and  xxxd2191xxx  were purchased from gibco-life technologies (eggenstein, germany). all other materials were from
sources as described earlier (klotz et al. 1998).
cdna of human beta-adrenergic receptors. cdnas coding for human
beta-adrenergic receptors in pcdna3 expression vectors were verified by sequencing and comparison with the respective genebank
entries. the translated amino acid sequences correspond to the
published sequences for the  xxxg836xxx -adrenergic receptor (frielle at al.

1987; genbank entry j03019),  xxxg837xxx   xxxg1553xxx   xxxg2356xxx -adrenergic receptor (schofield
et al. 1987; genbank entry y00106), and  xxxg838xxx -adrenergic receptor
(emorine et al. 1989; genbank entry x72861). with respect to
polymorphisms, the beta adrenergic receptors used in this study correspond to the following variants:  xxxg836xxx -receptor 49-ser, 389-gly;
 xxxg837xxx   xxxg1553xxx   xxxg2356xxx -receptor 16-arg, 27-gln, 164-thr;  xxxg838xxx -receptor 64-trp. all of the
variants correspond to the sequences originally termed wild-type.
stable transfection of cells. chinese hamster ovary cells (cho-k1
cells; ccl61, american type culture collection, rockville, md,
usa) were transfected with plasmid dna for stable expression
using the calcium phosphate precipitation method (chen and
okayama 1987) as described for the rat a1 adenosine receptor
(freund et al. 1994). positive clones were selected with 600 µg/ml
of the neomycin analog  xxxd2191xxx , and single clonal lines were isolated by limiting dilution. expression of the receptor was verified
by radioligand binding.
cell culture and membrane preparation. chinese hamster ovary
cells stably transfected with human beta-adrenergic receptor subtypes
were grown adherently and maintained in dulbecco’s modified
eagle’s medium with nutrient mixture f12 (dmem/f12), containing 10% fetal calf serum, penicillin (100 u/ml), streptomycin
(100 µg/ml), l-glutamine (2 mm) and  xxxd2191xxx  ( xxxd2191xxx , 0.2 mg/ml)
at 37°c in 5% co2/95% air. cells were split 2 or 3 times weekly
at a ratio between 1:5 and 1:15. in order to harvest cells the culture
medium was removed, cells were washed twice with pbs and
membranes were prepared or cells were frozen on the dishes for
later preparation of membranes. crude membrane fractions were
prepared from fresh (measurement of adenylyl cyclase) or frozen
cells (radioligand binding) according to two different protocols,
which have been described recently (klotz et al. 1998). the resulting membrane pellets were resuspended in 50 mm tris/hcl buffer
ph 7.4 to give a final protein concentration of 1–2 mg/ml. protein
content was determined by the method of bradford (1976) with
bovine  xxxg124xxx  (sigma) as a standard.
radioligand binding studies and adenylyl cyclase activity. the radioligand binding experiments were performed with membranes prepared as described above. assays were done in a volume of 200 µl
in 50 mm tris/hcl, ph 7.4 (assay buffer) in the presence of 100 µm
gtp to ensure monophasic binding curves for agonists. for saturation binding experiments at human  xxxg836xxx - and  xxxg837xxx   xxxg1553xxx   xxxg2356xxx -receptors we used up
to 400 pm 125i-cyp and for  xxxg838xxx -receptors up to 1,500 pm 125i-cyp.
non-specific binding was determined in the presence of 10 µm  xxxd123xxx . for competition binding we used 50 pm 125i-cyp in the
case of  xxxg836xxx - and  xxxg837xxx   xxxg1553xxx   xxxg2356xxx -receptors, or 80 pm 125i-cyp for  xxxg838xxx -receptors.
for most of the competition binding experiments membranes with
intermediate receptor expression ( xxxg836xxx : 367±75 fmol/mg protein,  xxxg837xxx   xxxg1553xxx   xxxg2356xxx :
282±19 fmol/mg protein,  xxxg838xxx : 377±82 fmol/mg protein) were used.
for selected compounds it was demonstrated that higher receptor
expression did not affect ki-values (data not shown). membranes
were incubated for 90 min at 30°c, filtered through whatman gf/c
filters, and washed three times with ice-cold assay buffer. samples
were counted in a gamma-counter (wallac 1480 wizard 3”). kd-values
for 125i-cyp were calculated by nonlinear curve fitting with the
program sctfit (de lean et al. 1982). ligand ic50-values were
calculated using origin 6.1 (originlab corporation, northampton,
ma, usa) and were transformed to ki-values according to cheng
and prusoff (1973).
adenylyl cyclase activity in cell membranes was determined
according to jakobs et al. (1976). fifty micrograms of membrane
protein were added to an incubation mixture with final concentrations of 50 mm tris/hcl ph 7.4, 100 µm camp, 0.2% bsa, 10 µm
gtp, 100 µm atp, 1 mm mgcl2, 100 µm  xxxd2388xxx , 15 mm phosphocreatine, and 300 u/ml of creatine kinase. membranes were incubated with about 200,000 cpm of [alpha-32p]-atp for 20 min in the
incubation mixture as described (klotz et al. 1985). accumulation
of [alpha-32p]-camp was linear over at least 20 min under all conditions. the reaction was stopped by addition of 400 µl 125 mm
znac-solution and 500 µl 144 mm na2co3. samples were centrifuged for 5 min at 14,000 rpm in a laboratory microcentrifuge.

153
eight hundred microliters of the resulting supernatant were finally
applied to aluminia wn-6 (sigma) columns that were eluted twice
with 2 ml 100 mm tris/hcl ph 7.4. the eluates were counted in a
beta-counter (beckmann ls 1801). data were calculated using origin 6.1. the basal and  xxxd2401xxx -stimulated adenylyl cyclase
activity, respectively, in the different cell clones characterized in
table 3 was (all values in pmol/mg membrane protein/min)
30.9±4.5 and 65.4±5.8 ( xxxg836xxx , clone 2); 4.3±0.5 and 11.1±1 ( xxxg837xxx   xxxg1553xxx   xxxg2356xxx , clone
1); 27.0±2.8 and 36.0±1.5 ( xxxg837xxx   xxxg1553xxx   xxxg2356xxx , clone 2) 104±4.5 and 138±6.8 ( xxxg837xxx   xxxg1553xxx   xxxg2356xxx ,
clone 3); 26±2.8 and 93.7±6.0 ( xxxg838xxx , clone 2).

ity which is in agreement with previous binding data for the
rat subtypes (neve et al. 1986). for different clones of beta1and  xxxg837xxx   xxxg1553xxx   xxxg2356xxx -receptors kd-values of 62–95 pm and 45–51 pm
respectively were determined. at the  xxxg838xxx -receptor subtype
a 3.5–6-fold lower affinity was observed (kd-values 210–
360 pm).

competition binding

results
the cho cells utilized for stable transfection with beta-adrenergic receptor subtypes appear to have negligible amounts
of endogenous beta-adrenergic receptors according to two
criteria: first, in untransfected cho cells 125i-cyp binding was only slightly different from non-specific binding,
corresponding to an endogenous beta-adrenergic receptor
level of <15 fmol/mg protein (less than 5% of the binding
observed in transfected cells), and second, no  xxxd2401xxx -induced adenylyl cyclase stimulation was observed
with membranes prepared from untransfected cells (data
not shown). after transfection with either of the human
beta-adrenergic receptor subtypes substantial specific binding of the antagonist 125i-cyp was observed and receptormediated stimulation of adenylyl cyclase demonstrated
functional coupling of the beta-adrenergic receptors to adenylyl cyclase.
receptor expression
cho cells were transfected with one of the three human
beta-adrenergic receptors and several clones stably expressing one of the individual subtypes were obtained. the saturation binding data shown in table 1 reveal that for all
three subtypes cell lines with comparable expression level
(about 300 fmol/mg protein) were obtained. for both beta1and  xxxg837xxx   xxxg1553xxx   xxxg2356xxx -receptors we obtained also cell lines with a 30-fold
difference in receptor expression levels. receptor expression was routinely controlled and was constant when cells
were maintained in culture for 6–8 weeks (15–25 passages). fig. 1 shows a representative saturation binding experiment for each human beta-receptor subtype stably expressed in cho cells. the kd-values in table 1 show that
125i-cyp binds to beta - and beta -receptors with similar affin1

we continued to investigate the pharmacological profile
of human beta-adrenergic receptors in cho cells in competition binding experiments. in addition to the endogenous
agonists epinephrine and norepinephrine, clinically relevant drugs as well as experimental compounds were investigated for their binding profile at the three subtypes.
since binding experiments were performed in the presence of 100 µm gtp all ki-values for agonists reflect low
affinity binding.
for the endogenous agonists epinephrine and norepinephrine we observed no selectivity with respect to binding at the  xxxg836xxx -adrenergic receptors. at the  xxxg837xxx   xxxg1553xxx   xxxg2356xxx -adrenergic receptor epinephrine was more potent than norepinephrine
(see table 2). the  xxxg837xxx   xxxg1553xxx   xxxg2356xxx -receptor exhibits a 35-fold higher
affinity for epinephrine than for norepinephrine. at the
 xxxg838xxx -adrenergic receptor we observed the opposite, i.e. a very
low binding affinity for epinephrine. according to our
data, the  xxxg838xxx -subtype exhibited a 30-fold higher affinity for
norepinephrine compared to epinephrine.
among the clinically used  xxxg837xxx   xxxg1553xxx   xxxg2356xxx -adrenergic receptor agonists only salmeterol and to a lesser extent  xxxd2098xxx  exhibited some selectivity for the  xxxg837xxx   xxxg1553xxx   xxxg2356xxx -adrenergic receptor. from
this group salmeterol was also the most selective compound for  xxxg837xxx   xxxg1553xxx   xxxg2356xxx - vs.  xxxg838xxx -adrenergic receptors. both salbutamol and terbutaline showed a similar affinity profile, i.e.,
almost the same affinity for  xxxg836xxx - and  xxxg837xxx   xxxg1553xxx   xxxg2356xxx -receptors and low
affinity for the  xxxg838xxx  subtype.
within the group of beta-blockers  xxxd2957xxx , carvedilol,
and s-propranolol were found to be non-selective for beta1vs.  xxxg837xxx   xxxg1553xxx   xxxg2356xxx -adrenergic receptors, while atenolol, bisoprolol,
and metoprolol were up to 63-fold selective for  xxxg836xxx - vs.
 xxxg837xxx   xxxg1553xxx   xxxg2356xxx -adrenergic receptors. of this group, bisoprolol was the
most selective compound with respect to selectivity for
 xxxg836xxx - vs.  xxxg838xxx -adrenergic receptors. all three compounds were
170–400-fold selective for  xxxg836xxx  compared to the  xxxg838xxx  receptor.

similar values for  xxxg836xxx - and  xxxg837xxx   xxxg1553xxx   xxxg2356xxx -affinities for s-propranolol in
functional experiments with preparations from human
myocardium.
among the experimental substances cgp-20712 was
the most selective compound for  xxxg836xxx - vs.  xxxg837xxx   xxxg1553xxx   xxxg2356xxx - and  xxxg838xxx -receptors, while ici-118551 was the most selective compound
for  xxxg837xxx   xxxg1553xxx   xxxg2356xxx - vs.  xxxg836xxx - and  xxxg838xxx -receptors.
according to our data, brl-37344 exhibited the highest selectivity for the human  xxxg838xxx -adrenergic receptor (90fold vs.  xxxg836xxx , 20-fold vs.  xxxg837xxx   xxxg1553xxx   xxxg2356xxx ). however, the highest affinity
for  xxxg838xxx -adrenergic receptors was observed for  xxxd123xxx 
and  xxxd2957xxx  (table 2).
adenylyl cyclase stimulation

fig. 1 125i-cyp saturation binding to human beta-adrenergic receptor
subtypes. the results of representative saturation binding experiments using membranes from cho-cells stably expressing the respective receptor subtype and the antagonist radioligand 125i-cyp
are shown as specific (black circles) and non-specific binding
(white circles). saturation binding at human  xxxg836xxx -,  xxxg837xxx   xxxg1553xxx   xxxg2356xxx -, and  xxxg838xxx -receptors is shown. the results of the particular experiment shown were
for  xxxg836xxx -receptor, kd-value 68 pm and bmax 380 fmol/mg protein;
 xxxg837xxx   xxxg1553xxx   xxxg2356xxx -receptor 59 pm and 1,350 fmol/mg protein and,  xxxg838xxx -receptor
310 pm and 250 fmol/mg protein. the results of the all saturation
binding experiments are summarized in table 1

next, we tested adenylyl cyclase stimulation by  xxxd2401xxx , norepinephrine, and epinephrine in isolated membranes from stably transfected cho cells with comparable receptor expression for each receptor subtype (fig. 2).
all concentration-response curves for these agonists were
shifted to the left compared to the respective binding
curves. however, the rank order of potency in the binding
and cyclase experiments was identical (fig. 2, table 2)
and was found to be iso >na = a at the  xxxg836xxx -receptor, iso =
a >>na at the  xxxg837xxx   xxxg1553xxx   xxxg2356xxx -receptor, and iso >na >a at the  xxxg838xxx -receptor.  xxxd2401xxx , norepinephrine and epinephrine
were full agonists at each receptor.
we then characterized all compounds investigated in
table 2 and determined their efficacy and classification as
agonists, antagonists or inverse agonists. therefore, we
investigated single maximally effective concentrations of
the ligands in adenylyl cyclase assays in cell lines expressing the different beta-adrenergic receptors at comparable expression levels. compound concentrations used in
this assay were generally 100×ki-value (as given in table 2),
or maximally 1 mm. as judged by the data for epinephrine, norepinephrine and  xxxd2401xxx  (fig. 2), at these
concentrations a full effect on adenylyl cyclase should be
achieved for all compounds. the maximal stimulation
with  xxxd2401xxx  and unstimulated basal values were determined in each individual experiment and were used as
a reference for the efficacy of the other compounds. the
data were calculated as percent stimulation by  xxxd2401xxx .
for compounds that reduced the adenylyl cyclase activity
below the unstimulated basal activity the degree of  xxxd1422xxx  activity was determined as percent reduction
of basal adenylyl cyclase activity.
the results of these experiments are summarized in
table 3. functionally, the compounds fall into several different categories. a group of five compounds, namely  xxxd2401xxx , epinephrine, norepinephrine,  xxxd2155xxx  and
 xxxd2098xxx  are agonists at all three receptor subtypes. the
so-called  xxxg837xxx   xxxg1553xxx   xxxg2356xxx -agonists salbutamol, terbutaline, and broxaterol behaved as partial agonists at the  xxxg837xxx   xxxg1553xxx   xxxg2356xxx -receptor and as
opposed to  xxxd2098xxx  were antagonists at the  xxxg836xxx -receptor.
their efficacy at the  xxxg838xxx -receptor subtype ranged from
42–87%. the long-acting asthma drug salmeterol was
found to be the only  xxxg837xxx   xxxg1553xxx   xxxg2356xxx -receptor agonist with no agonistic

activity at the other receptor subtypes, where it acted as an
 xxxd1422xxx . all other compounds tested were antagonists or inverse agonists at  xxxg836xxx - and  xxxg837xxx   xxxg1553xxx   xxxg2356xxx -receptors and exhibited characteristic differences at the  xxxg838xxx -receptor, with
activities ranging from partial agonistic activity (e.g.,
cgp-12177) to inverse agonistic activity (ici-118 551).
since differential expression of  xxxg837xxx   xxxg1553xxx   xxxg2356xxx -adrenergic receptors
had been shown to modify agonist stimulation of adenylyl
cyclase (bouvier et al. 1988; lohse 1992; whaley et al.
1994) we wanted to investigate whether receptor expression also had an influence on  xxxd1422xxx  activity.
therefore, we measured modulation of adenylyl cyclase
activity in membranes from cho cells expressing  xxxg837xxx   xxxg1553xxx   xxxg2356xxx -adrenergic receptors at different levels. the results are summarized in table 4. the agonist epinephrine was found to be
a full agonist and its efficacy was independent of receptor
expression within the tested range. the partial agonist
 xxxd2098xxx , however, varied in its efficacy with respect to
receptor expression, exhibiting partial agonist activity at
low receptor expression levels and an increasing efficacy
with higher receptor expression levels. a similar variation
in efficacy was observed for compounds that exhibited  xxxd1422xxx  activity. they were found to behave as neutral antagonists at low receptor expression and inverse agonism became more prominent with increasing receptor
expression levels.

discussion
stable transfection of receptors into cho cells provides
useful models for the investigation of the human receptor
subtypes in an identical cellular background. in this study
we establish such transfected cell systems for the three
known subtypes of human beta-adrenergic receptors along
with a comparative pharmacological characterization using selected experimental compounds as well as clinically
relevant drugs. in general, the stably transfected receptors
exhibited the expected pharmacological profile with respect to ligand binding. however, with respect to functional assays several interesting discoveries were made.
in our study we used 125i-cyp as a radioligand at the different beta-adrenergic receptor subtypes, which is widely
used in many laboratories. levin et al. (2002) characterized the 49-ser variant of human  xxxg836xxx -adrenergic receptor that
was also used in the present study and published a 125i-cyp
kd-value of 57 pm in stably transfected hek-293 cells,
which is in excellent agreement with our data (see table 1).
in another study a  xxxg836xxx  kd-value of 17 pm was found for
125i-cyp (tate et al. 1991) which is somewhat lower than
our values of 62 and 95 pm for two different cell clones
respectively. in the same study tate et al. (1991) had observed kd-values of 31 pm at  xxxg837xxx   xxxg1553xxx   xxxg2356xxx - and 230 pm at  xxxg838xxx -receptors, which is again in close agreement with our data in
table 1.
the pharmacological profile of the three human beta-adrenergic receptors in stably transfected cho cells was estab-

fig. 2 agonist-stimulated adenylyl cyclase activity in membranes
isolated from cho-cells stably expressing human beta-adrenergic receptor subtypes. membranes were prepared as described in materials and methods. adenylyl cyclase stimulation was calculated as
% of the maximal stimulation achieved by each compound. maximal adenylyl cyclase was achieved with concentrations corresponding to 100-fold ki-values as given in table 2. adenylyl cyclase stimulation is shown for  xxxd2401xxx  (squares), norepinephrine (triangles), and epinephrine (circles) at human  xxxg836xxx -,  xxxg837xxx   xxxg1553xxx   xxxg2356xxx - and
 xxxg838xxx -receptor. data are representative of three to four experiments
done in duplicate

lished in competition binding experiments. since binding
experiments were performed in the presence of 100 µm
gtp all ki-values for agonists reflect low affinity binding. the results of the competition binding experiments
are summarized in table 2. in general, these data are in
good agreement with individual results reported in different publications. for example, recently levin et al. (2002)
published ki-values for low affinity binding of  xxxd2401xxx  (268 nm), norepinephrine (3,600 nm), and metoprolol (54 nm) at the 49-ser variant of the human  xxxg836xxx -adrenergic receptor. del carmine et al. (2002) have recently
published a binding study at the human  xxxg837xxx   xxxg1553xxx   xxxg2356xxx -adrenergic receptor stably expressed in cho cells. since in that study
binding affinities were determined in the absence of gtp,
the data for agonist binding can not be directly compared
to our data, however the rank order of  xxxd2401xxx  >epinephrine =  xxxd2098xxx  >salbutamol >norepinephrine is
identical to our findings. data for antagonist binding (e.g.,
ici-118,551 with a kd-value of 0.68 nm and s-propranolol with a kd-value of 0.43 nm), however, are similar to
our findings.
michel (1991) had summarized ligand binding data for
 xxxg836xxx - and  xxxg837xxx   xxxg1553xxx   xxxg2356xxx -adrenergic receptor that were available from
the literature. since these data were from different species
and tissues, they cannot be directly compared to our data.
again, however, the overall pharmacological profiles are
comparable to our findings.  xxxd2401xxx  was about equally
potent on  xxxg836xxx - and  xxxg837xxx   xxxg1553xxx   xxxg2356xxx -receptors, epinephrine bound slightly
better to the  xxxg837xxx   xxxg1553xxx   xxxg2356xxx -receptor and norepinephrine was 10-fold
selective for  xxxg836xxx - vs.  xxxg837xxx   xxxg1553xxx   xxxg2356xxx -receptor. among the clinically
used  xxxg837xxx   xxxg1553xxx   xxxg2356xxx -agonists, terbutaline and salbutamol were found
to be non-selective whereas  xxxd2098xxx  was more potent at
the  xxxg837xxx   xxxg1553xxx   xxxg2356xxx -receptor. all these characteristics were reproduced
for the transfected human receptors in cho cells in this
study. in addition, we found the expected  xxxg837xxx   xxxg1553xxx   xxxg2356xxx -selectivity
for sameterol whereas  xxxd2155xxx  turned out to be nonselective (table 2). the selectivity profile for beta-ar antagonists reported by michel (1991) was also found to be similar for the non-selective compounds  xxxd2957xxx  and s-propranolol as well as atenolol, bisoprolol, and metoprolol
which were  xxxg836xxx  selective. overall it appears that in the case
of  xxxg836xxx - and  xxxg837xxx   xxxg1553xxx   xxxg2356xxx -adrenergic receptors species differences play
only a minor role.
less information is available about the pharmacological profile of the  xxxg838xxx -adrenergic receptor. at the human
 xxxg838xxx -adrenergic receptor we observed a surprisingly low binding affinity for epinephrine. according to our binding data
the  xxxg838xxx -receptor exhibits a 30-fold higher affinity for norepinephrine over epinephrine. the low affinity of epinephrine at the  xxxg838xxx –receptor was shown before (liggett 1992)
although the difference between epinephrine and norepinephrine was less pronounced than in our study.
clinically used antagonists showed the expected selectivity patterns with  xxxg836xxx -selectivity of atenolol, bisoprolol
and metoprolol. both carvedilol and s-propranolol do not
discriminate  xxxg836xxx - and  xxxg837xxx   xxxg1553xxx   xxxg2356xxx -receptors but bind with ≥100-fold
lower affinity to the  xxxg838xxx -subtype. of the experimental compounds cgp-20712 and ici-118551 were confirmed as
 xxxg836xxx - and  xxxg837xxx   xxxg1553xxx   xxxg2356xxx -selective antagonists, respectively. in contrast,

sr 59230a did not show the expected  xxxg838xxx -selectivity. in
our hands this compound was about 4- and 7-fold more
potent at the  xxxg836xxx -subtype than at  xxxg837xxx   xxxg1553xxx   xxxg2356xxx -and  xxxg838xxx -receptors respectively.
receptor signaling was investigated in adenylyl cyclase assays using cell lines with similar expression levels
(~300 fmol/mg membrane protein) for the three beta-receptor subtypes. the affinity profile for the endogenous agonists and  xxxd2401xxx  is shown in fig. 2. from these data
it can be concluded that the human  xxxg836xxx -receptor does not

distinguish between the endogenous ligands norepinephrine and epinephrine, while the  xxxg837xxx   xxxg1553xxx   xxxg2356xxx -receptor would be the
‘adrenergic’ receptor and the  xxxg838xxx -receptor would be a ‘noradrenergic’ receptor. since the expression of the human
 xxxg838xxx -receptor has been reported to be mainly in adipose tissue it might escape adrenal stimulation and have its main
role in responding to stimulated sympathetic neurons (giacobino 1995). steinle et al. (2003) reported that  xxxg838xxx -receptors are also expressed on cultured human retinal endothelial cells and stimulation of these receptors by brl-37344

158

stimulates cell migration, an early marker for angiogenesis. therefore, they conclude that sympathetic nerves
might also play a role in vascular disorders of the eye.
from fig. 2 it can also be concluded that at compound
concentrations of 100×ki-value the adenylyl cyclase activation should be maximal at least for full agonists. the
data in table 3 show a measure for efficacy of each compound relative to  xxxd2401xxx  as a reference. according
to their efficacy at the different beta-receptor subtypes the
tested compounds could be divided into several groups.
the clinically relevant  xxxg837xxx   xxxg1553xxx   xxxg2356xxx -receptor agonists differed
markedly in their efficacy at  xxxg836xxx -receptors and  xxxg838xxx -receptors.
 xxxd2098xxx  and  xxxd2155xxx  were the only compounds to exhibit agonistic activity at all receptor subtypes, salbutamol
and terbutaline were agonists at  xxxg837xxx   xxxg1553xxx   xxxg2356xxx - and  xxxg838xxx -receptors and
antagonists at  xxxg836xxx -receptors, whereas salmeterol was only
agonistic at  xxxg837xxx   xxxg1553xxx   xxxg2356xxx -receptors. such mixed activity for  xxxg837xxx   xxxg1553xxx   xxxg2356xxx -agonists was already described for the experimental compound broxaterol (conti et al. 1998), but we did not find
evidence in the literature for similar behavior of other
 xxxg837xxx   xxxg1553xxx   xxxg2356xxx -agonists. however, our findings may be of importance
for clinical use of those compounds as the  xxxg836xxx -activity of
sympathomimetics determines the cardiac side effects. the
‘functional’  xxxg837xxx   xxxg1553xxx   xxxg2356xxx -selectivity of salbutamol and terbutaline may
be superior to binding selectivity as it should not result in
cardiac side effects even at higher doses.
when further analyzing table 3 we found a large group
of compounds showing inverse agonism at  xxxg836xxx - and  xxxg837xxx   xxxg1553xxx   xxxg2356xxx -receptors but differing in their efficacy at  xxxg838xxx -receptors.
brl-37344 was the only compound that is close to being
a neutral antagonist at  xxxg836xxx - and  xxxg837xxx   xxxg1553xxx   xxxg2356xxx - and was found to be
functionally selective for  xxxg838xxx -receptors. previously, this
compound has been described as an agonist at all beta-receptor subtypes (blin et al. 1993). currently we can not explain the discrepancy to our findings. although  xxxd2957xxx 
is generally claimed to be a partial agonist it showed inverse agonism at  xxxg836xxx - and  xxxg837xxx   xxxg1553xxx   xxxg2356xxx -receptors and only 13% agonistic activity at  xxxg838xxx -receptors in comparison to  xxxd2401xxx . all other experimental and clinically used beta-blockers behaved as antagonists or inverse agonists at all three
receptor subtypes. del carmine et al. (2002) have recently
published a thorough study on the behavior of compound
efficacy at human  xxxg837xxx   xxxg1553xxx   xxxg2356xxx -receptors expressed in cho cells.
overall, we find an identical activity pattern in our study
although the absolute degree of efficacy was different.
these differences in efficacy may be related to different
receptor expression levels. as seen in table 4 the efficacy
for  xxxd2098xxx  does indeed increase with increasing receptor expression. del carmine et al. measured adenylyl cyclase stimulation in cells expressing 8.4 pmol receptor/mg
membrane protein while we used cells expressing about
0.3 pmol/mg protein, thus, this difference in receptor expression can easily explain the differences in efficacy.
table 4 shows that inverse agonistic activity can be best
observed at high receptor density. since inverse agonists
are assumed to promote an inactive conformation of the
receptor (samama et al. 1994) their effect is most likely
more striking due to a higher number of spontaneously active receptors with increasing receptor expression.

in summary, we provide cellular systems that allow the
comparison of beta-adrenergic receptor ligands directly at
the human receptor subtypes in an identical cellular background. the stably transfected receptors exhibit the expected pharmacological profile with respect to ligand
binding. in functional assays these model cells allow for a
detailed investigation of ligand properties and with such
analysis some surprising discoveries were made in this
study.
