objective: the purpose of this study was to determine the
mechanism of the direct effects of fentanyl on human veins
in vitro.
design: in vitro, prospective with repeated measures.
setting: university research laboratory.
interventions: dose-response curves were obtained for cumulative doses of fentanyl (10ⴚ9-10ⴚ5 mol/l) on saphenous
vein strips precontracted with (10ⴚ6 mol/l) 5-hydroxytryptamine incubated with either naloxone (10ⴚ4 mol/l), n␻-nitrolarginine-methyl ester (l-name) (10ⴚ4 mol/l), indomethacin
(10ⴚ5 mol/l),  xxxd2215xxx  (10ⴚ4 mol/l), tetraethylammonium (10ⴚ4 mol/l), or ouabain (10ⴚ5 mol/l). vein strips were
also exposed to a caⴙⴙ-free solution and 0.1 mmol/l of ethylene glycol-bis-(b-aminoethylether) n,n=-tetraacetic acid; 5-hydroxytryptamine (10ⴚ6 mol/l) was added to the bath before
cumulative caⴙⴙ (10ⴚ4ⴚ10ⴚ2 mol/l). the same procedure was
repeated in the presence of fentanyl (10ⴚ6, 3 ⴛ 10ⴚ6, or 10ⴚ5
mol/l) (p < 0.05 ⴝ significant).

d

uring clinical use, fentanyl is believed to have the
advantage of stable hemodynamics. despite its clinical
safety, there are both animal and human studies that show that
fentanyl may cause venodilation or reduce peripheral vascular
resistance (pvr).1,2 in the isolated hindlimb of dogs, white et
al1 found that high-dose fentanyl caused a significant decrease
in systemic vascular resistance. in a recent in vitro study,
duman et al2 showed that in human saphenous vein strips
fentanyl produces concentration-dependent relaxation starting
at clinically relevant concentrations. mechanisms responsible
for this fentanyl-induced vasodilatation in veins have not been
studied. the present in vitro study was designed to determine
the mechanism of the direct effects of fentanyl on human
saphenous vein smooth muscle. the authors posed the following questions: (1) are opioid receptors, k⫹ channels and
cyclooxygenase,  xxxd2738xxx  synthase, or na⫹k⫹-adenosine
triphosphatase (atpase) enzymes responsible for the fentanyl-induced vasodilatation, and (2) is fentanyl-induced
vasodilatation linked to calcium channel antagonism?
methods
the authors’ institutional review board approved this study, and
written consent of the patients was obtained. human saphenous veins
were obtained from patients undergoing myocardial revascularization.
the discarded saphenous vein segments were placed in cold krebshenseleit solution (khs) and transferred to the laboratory. after
removal of the surrounding tissue, vein segments were cut into helical
2 ⫻ 15 mm strips and suspended in a 10-ml organ bath containing
khs at 37°c and continuously bubbled with 95% o2 and 5% co2 gas
mixture. at the beginning of the experiment, the strips were stretched
to an initial tension of 2 g and allowed to equilibrate for 60 minutes in
the khs, which was changed every 15 minutes.
after the equilibrium period, the following procedures were conducted:
protocol 1: the tissue (n ⫽ 8) was contracted with 10⫺6 mol/l 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-ht; sigma, st. louis, mo). after the contraction had reached a steady state, cumulative concentration relaxation

measurements and main results: preincubation of vein
strips with naloxone, l-name, or indomethacin did not influence the relaxant responses to fentanyl (p > 0.05). tetraethylammonium,  xxxd2215xxx , and ouabain reduced the
relaxation response to fentanyl (p < 0.05). a stepwise increase in tension was recorded with cumulative doses of
caⴙⴙ (p < 0.05).
conclusions: the present results show that fentanyl
causes vasodilatation via both endothelium– and opioid receptor–independent mechanisms in the human saphenous
vein. the relaxant effects of fentanyl are probably via activation of kⴙ channel and naⴙkⴙ-adenosine trisphosphatase
and inhibition of caⴙⴙ channel.

(10⫺9-10⫺5 mol/l) were obtained with 1 curve per preparation. the
maximal 5-ht contraction was then used as a standard by which
subsequent responses of the tissue could be expressed (as a percentage of this contraction). this was done to standardize responses
between strips.
protocol 2: to evaluate the role of opioid receptors in the effect of
fentanyl (10⫺9-10⫺5 mol/l), strips precontracted with 5-ht (10⫺6
mol/l) (n ⫽ 8) were incubated for 20 minutes with naloxone
(sigma) (10⫺4 mol/l). after this incubation, dose-response curves
were obtained to cumulative doses of fentanyl (10⫺9-10⫺5 mol/l).
protocol 3: to determine whether the vasorelaxant effect of fentanyl is
mediated by  xxxd2738xxx  or prostacyclin, the saphenous vein strips (n
⫽ 8) were preincubated for 20 minutes with n␻- xxxd2741xxx -argininemethyl ester (l-name, sigma) (10⫺ mol/l) or indomethacin
(sigma) (10⫺5 mol/l) after the maximal contractile response to
5-ht. after this incubation, cumulative fentanyl (10⫺9-10⫺5 mol/l)
was added, and dose-response curves were recorded.
protocol 4: to determine whether the vasorelaxant effect of fentanyl is
mediated by k⫹ channels, the strips (n ⫽ 8) were preincubated with
 xxxd2215xxx  (sigma) (10⫺4 mol/l) or tetraethylammonium (tea,
sigma) (10⫺4) after maximal contractile response to 5-ht. fentanyl
(10⫺9-10⫺5 mol/l) was added 20 minutes later, and dose-response
curves were recorded.
protocol 5: saphenous vein strips precontracted with 5-ht (n ⫽ 8) were
incubated for 20 minutes with ouabain (sigma) (10⫺5 mol/l); a
na⫹k⫹-atpase inhibitor before fentanyl (10⫺9-10⫺5 mol/l) was
added, and dose-response curves were recorded.

protocol 6: to determine whether the blockade of extracellular calcium
influx via ca⫹⫹ channels is involved, the strips were contracted with
5-ht (10⫺6 mol/l) in khs. the tissues were then exposed to a
ca⫹⫹-free solution, which was prepared by omitting cacl2 from the
khs and adding 0.1 mmol/l ethylene glycol-bis-(b-aminoethylether) n,n=-tetraacetic acid (egta) for 30 minutes. after equilibration, 5-ht (10⫺6 mol/l) was added to the bath before cumulative
administration of ca⫹⫹ (10⫺4-10⫺2 mol/l). the same procedure was
repeated in the presence of fentanyl (10⫺6, 3 ⫻ 10⫺6, or 10⫺5 mol/l)
administered 20 minutes before cumulative ca⫹⫹.
in all protocol groups, isometric recordings of tension changes were
obtained with force transducers (grass fto4; grass instrument co, w
warwick, ri) connected through amplifiers to a polygraph (grass 7d,

the effects of fentanyl are expressed as the percentage of the control
contractile response elicited  xxxd1891xxx ⫺6 mol/l of 5-ht. inhibitor concentration 50 values were calculated as the concentration of fentanyl
required to elicit 50% of the maximal relaxation. the maximum effect
values were calculated as the percentage of the maximal response of the
tissue to fentanyl. the percent changes were calculated and the results
were expressed as mean ⫾ standard deviation. one-way analysis of
variance test was used for analysis and tukey hsd was used as post
hoc test. a p value of ⬍0.05 was considered significant.
results

5-ht (10⫺6 mol/l) produced contraction in human saphenous vein strips. responses to 5-ht were reproducible, and
time-dependent changes were not observed. after obtaining
steady-state responses to 5-ht (10⫺6 mol/l), fentanyl (10⫺910⫺5 mol/l) relaxed the saphenous vein strips in a concentration-dependent manner (p ⬍ 0.05). inhibitor concentration 50
and the maximum effect of fentanyl for 5-ht–induced contractions on human saphenous veins are given in table 1.
preincubation of saphenous vein strips with naloxone (10⫺4
mol/l), l-name (10⫺4 mol/l), or indomethacin (10⫺5 mol/l)
did not influence relaxant responses to fentanyl (fig 1). in
contrast, tea (10⫺4 mol/l),  xxxd2215xxx  (10⫺6 mol/l), and
ouabain (10⫺5 mol/l) markedly reduced the relaxation to fentanyl (p ⬍ 0.05) (fig 1). the sensitivity of saphenous vein
strips to fentanyl was reduced in the presence of these agents (p
⬍ 0.05) (fig 1).
in the absence of extracellular calcium, readdition of ca⫹⫹
(10⫺4⫺10-2 mol/l), in the presence of 5-ht, caused a stepwise
increase in tension (emax: 117% ⫾ 5.6%). maximum responses
to 5-ht, obtained by cumulative readdition of ca⫹⫹, were
reduced by 10⫺6, 3 ⫻ 10⫺6, and 10⫺5 mol/l of nifedipine by

discussion

in the present study, fentanyl caused concentration-dependent relaxation in human saphenous vein strips preconstricted
with 5-ht. to determine if vascular responses were mediated
by an opioid receptor, dose-response studies for fentanyl were
repeated in the presence of naloxone, an opioid-receptor antagonist. pretreatment with naloxone had no effect on fentanylinduced relaxation of human saphenous vein strips. this vasodilatory effect of fentanyl seems to be caused by a direct effect
on smooth muscle cells and is not mediated through opioid
receptors. this is consistent with the findings of yamanoue et
al3 and karasawa et al4 who reported that naloxone did not
affect the fentanyl-induced vasodilation.
endothelium releases autacoids such as  xxxd2738xxx  or prostacyclin.5 these autacoids could modify the response of relaxant agents. in the present study, the  xxxd2738xxx  synthase
inhibitor, l-name, and the cyclooxygenase inhibitor, indomethacin, did not alter the relaxant effect of fentanyl. based on
similar findings by other investigators, it is generally accepted
that fentanyl attenuates the contractile response to various
agents independently of endothelial function.5,6

regulate intracellular ca⫹⫹ dynamics induced by various vasoactive agonists in vascular smooth muscle cells.8 in the cardiovascular system, 5-ht–induced ca⫹⫹ influx may occur through
both voltage-independent and -dependent channels.9 therefore,
the authors examined the role of inhibition of external ca⫹⫹
influx in the relaxant effect of fentanyl in human saphenous
vein. when ca⫹⫹ is added to a ca⫹⫹-free khs, in the presence
of 5-ht, the contraction depends on ca⫹⫹ influx into vascular
smooth muscle cells through ca⫹⫹ channels. the maximum
responses to 5-ht, obtained by cumulative readdition of ca⫹⫹,
were significantly reduced by the used concentrations of fentanyl. similarly, introna et al6 observed that in canine coronary
artery rings, nifedipine, a calcium channel blocker, prevented
the relaxation in tension produced by fentanyl.6
potassium (k⫹) channels play an important role in the regulation of vascular smooth muscle cell membrane excitability
and tonus.10 activation of k⫹ channels in vascular smooth

muscle hyperpolarizes cell membranes and closes voltage-dependent calcium channels. these actions decrease intracellular
calcium and cause vascular smooth muscle relaxation. on the
contrary, inhibition of the channels produces membrane depolarization and vascular smooth muscle contraction.11  xxxd2215xxx  ( xxxd83xxx –sensitive k⫹ channel blocker)
and tea (ca⫹⫹-activated k⫹ channel blocker) suppressed the
relaxant effect of fentanyl in human saphenous vein. the
present results with  xxxd2215xxx  and tea show that k⫹
channels are involved in the vasorelaxant effects of fentanyl in
human saphenous vein. to the authors’ knowledge, this is the
first report investigating the interaction of fentanyl with k⫹
channel blockers in veins. a previous study has shown that
fentanyl exerts its antinociceptive action in the rat spinal cord
via the k⫹ channels.12
previous studies suggest that the sarcolemmal na⫹k⫹atpase plays an essential role in the maintenance of the
vascular smooth muscle tone.13,14 in smooth muscles, this pump
can directly contribute to the cell resting membrane potential
by actively pumping more sodium ions out than potassium ions
into the cells.15 membrane depolarization in response to inhibition of na⫹k⫹-atpase caused ca⫹⫹ channels to open and/or
increased ca⫹⫹ influx through na⫹-ca⫹⫹ exchange mechanism.16 it has been suggested that normal na⫹k⫹-atpase
activity is necessary for mediating vasorelaxant effects of some
drugs.17 in the present study, exposure to ouabain, which inhibits na⫹k⫹-atpase, inhibited maximal relaxant response to
fentanyl. the sensitivity of human saphenous vein to fentanyl
was also decreased by ouabain. these results indicate that the
relaxant effect of fentanyl in this vessel is partially dependent
on the na⫹k⫹-atpase activity.
observed changes in cardiac function after opioid administration depend on factors such as myocardial contractility,
sympathetic nervous system activity, and modifications in
heart rate, preload, and afterload.18 therefore, the direct
vasodilation caused by fentanyl in this study appears not to
be prominent in clinical practice. however, the dose-dependent relaxation in human saphenous veins observed in the
present and in duman et al’s study2 may be one of the
contributing factors to the final hemodynamic changes with
high-dose fentanyl after revascularization.
in conclusion, these results suggest that fentanyl causes
vasodilatation via both endothelium– and opioid receptor–
independent mechanisms in human saphenous vein. the
relaxant effects of fentanyl are probably via activation of k⫹
channel and na⫹k⫹-atpase and inhibition of ca⫹⫹ channels.
