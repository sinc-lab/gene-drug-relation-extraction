to investigate the relationship between 48 bp variant number tandem repeat
polymorphism in  xxxg658xxx  gene and response to clozapine in
schizophrenic patients, the authors included 81 inpatients with a dsm-iv diagnosis of schizophrenia and patients meeting criteria for refractory to treatment
were excluded. this study found that the frequencies of five 48 bp repeats
homozygous genotype and five 48 bp repeats allele were significantly less in
the responders than the nonresponders, which divided by improving total schizophrenic
symptom. the results of this study suggest that inherited variants of d4 may
explain some of the interindividual variation seen in patient response to clozapine.

clozapine, the prototype of atypical antipsychotic drugs, has many unique
clinical advantages for treatment of schizophrenia as compared to typical
antipsychotic drugs, which is effective in treating both the positive symptoms
and negative symptoms of schizophrenia and much less likely to cause extrapyramidal symptoms (eps) (meltzer, 1995, 1999). as with all other antipsychotics, clinical response to clozapine is variable among individuals. genetic
variation or polymorphism may be an important factor underlying interindividual
variation in response to clozapine.
there are two major areas for the pharmacogenetic investigation of its
interindividual variability in response: pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. pharmacokineties can be thought of as the effects of the organism on
the drug. steady-state plasma concentrations of clozapine can display more
than 45-fold variability between patients treated with the same oral dose
(potkin et al., 1994). there is strong evidence for a threshold for plasma
clozapine levels to achieve good response. it was found that plasma concentrations should equal or exceed 200 to 420 ng/ml to achieve a high rate of
response (masellis et al., 2000). so for studies examining genetic variation
in pharmacodynamic factors, confounding by pharmacokinetic factors, such
as variability in antipsychotic metabolism, should be controlled by ensuring
that patients maintain an adequate concentration of antipsychotic in their
plasma. pharmacodynamics can be conceptualized as the effects of the drug
on the organism. central pharmacodynamic factors are likely determinants of
interindividual variation in response to clozapine. several have suggested
that genetic factors may contribute to differences in pharmacodynamic response to clozapine (kerwin et al., 1994; kennedy, 1994; propping & nöthen,
1995). genetic variation in genes that encode receptor proteins for which
clozapine has affinity could account for variation in response.

 xxxg658xxx  gene and response to clozapine

1541

the pharmacological characteristics of  xxxg658xxx  ( xxxg658xxx )
resembles that of the d2 and d3 receptors, but clozapine binds to the d4
receptor with an affinity 10 times higher than to the d2 and d3 receptors,
and this receptor is a major target for clozapine (van tol et al., 1991). the
human  xxxg658xxx  gene has a polymorphism region consisting of variable number of tandem repeats of 48-base-pair in length in exon 3, which is repeated
between 2 to 10 times in different alleles. the number of the repeats influenced the binding of clozapine: variants with the long forms of repeats have
higher affinity for clozapine than the shorter forms, which suggested that
different vntr alleles have different pharmacological properties (van tol et
al., 1992). so  xxxg658xxx  is a good initial candidate gene to test in examining the
pharmacogenetics of clozapine. but several studies failed to find difference
in the allele frequency of  xxxg658xxx  exon 3 polymorphism between clozapine
responders and nonresponders. (rao et al., 1994; rietschel et al., 1996; shaikh
et al., 1995; kohn et al., 1997).
the current study was designed to examine the relationship between the
 xxxg658xxx  exon iii polymorphism and interindividual variation in response to
clozapine. moreover, in order to ascertain that patients maintain adequate
concentrations of clozapine in plasma, clozapine blood levels were monitored throughout the course of the treatment to exclude confounding by pharmacokinetic factors, such as variability, in clozapine metabolism.

materials and methods
subjects
the patients were a group of 81 on clozapine (44 males and 37 females),
aged 28.6 ± 9.5 years. patients were all chinese han population who came
from hu nan province with a dsm-iv diagnosis of schizophrenia. patients
meeting criteria for refractory to treatment were excluded (kane et al., 1988).
all patients received no medication prior to starting clozapine and all were
inpatients. clozapine doses varied between 200 and 450 mg daily and were
stable for at least two months after clinical stabilization. the response was
defined as reduction of at least 50% in the positive and negative symptom
scale (panss) (kay et al., 1987) from baseline score at enrollment into the
study. in order to ensure that patients maintain an adequate plasma therapeutic
concentration of clozapine, plasma clozapine levels were monitored during
treatment to assess compliance and exclude confusion raising by variability
in clozapine metabolism. the study complied with the guidelines of the local

genetic analysis
genomic dna was extracted from 5-ml aliquots of edta-anticoagulated
venous blood using standard procedures. a genomic dna fragment was
amplified by the polymerase chain reaction (pcr) with oligonucleotide primers specific for the d4 sequence 5'- xxxg873xxx  act acg tgg tct act cg-3';
5'-agg acc ctc atg gcc ttg-3' (adamson et al., 1995). the 20 ml
pcr mixture contained: 100 ng template dna, 200 mmol/l deoxyribonucleoside
triphosphates, 0.5 mmol/l of each primer, 1.5 mmol/l mgcl2, 1 m betaine
(sigma), and 1.0 units taq dna polymerase (takara, dalian, china). samples
were processed in a minicycler (mi). after an initial cycle at 99°c for 3 min,
72°c for 10 min, 35 cycles were carried out at 95°c for 30 s, 60°c 30 s, and
72°c for 1.0 min. the pcr products were electrophoresed on 8% silverstained denaturing polyacrylamide gel. a 100 bp dna step ladder (sigma)
was used to identify the various repeat alleles by size: 323 bp, 2 repeats; 371
bp, 3 repeats; 419 bp, 4 repeats; 467 bp, 5 repeats; 515 bp, 6 repeats; 563 bp,
7 repeats; 611 bp, 8 repeats.
statistical analysis
data were expressed as means ± sd. for the statistical analysis, spss (11.1
version) for windows computing program was used. for the mean ages,
plasma concentration, courses, and panss scores‚ comparisons between the
responders and nonresponders to clozapine were performed by using by ttests. comparisons of genotype and allele frequencies were made using the
chi-square test.
results
in 81 patients, plasma clozapine levels were from 247.9 ng/ml to 1642.3 ng/
ml, and mean plasma clozapine concentrations were 712.1 ± 346.2 ng/ml.
age, plasma clozapine levels, course, and the severity of psychiatric disturbance were similar between responders and nonresponders (table 1).
allele assignment of the polymorphism was made according to the number of 48 bp repeats. six different alleles and seven different genotypes were
detected in the samples. the data from the patients were in hardy-weinberg

discussion
 xxxg658xxx  is of great interest for research in psychopharmacology in light of the
fact that it binds the clozapine with higher affinity than does any other dopamine
receptor (van tol et al., 1991). furthermore, in the third exon of this gene,
there is an unusual 48-bp repeat sequence polymorphism that produces variable receptor protein sequences that have different affinities for the drug
clozapine (van tol et al., 1992). so interindividual differences in response to
clozapine therapy might be attributable to the  xxxg658xxx  alleles they carry.
the present study found that five 48 bp repeats homozygous genotype
and five 48 bp repeats allele frequency of 48 bp vntr polymorphism in the
third exon of  xxxg658xxx  gene was significantly less frequent in the responders
than in the nonresponders, which suggests that the functional variation at the
 xxxg658xxx  gene may be involved in the response to clozapine in non-refractory
schizophrenic patients. cohen et al. (1999) reported that patients responding

1545

to typical neuroleptics carried the allele for the long (seven repeat) form of
the  xxxg658xxx  less frequently than patients responding to clozapine or healthy
subjects, which suggested that inherited variants of d4 may explain some of
the interindividual variation seen in patient response to different classes of
antipsychotic medication. nevertheless, many similar studies found that  xxxg658xxx 
alleles do not predict therapeutic response to clozapine in refractory schizophrenic patients or acute schizophrenic patients (rao et al., 1994; rietschel
et al., 1996; shaikh et al., 1995; kaiser et al., 2000). the one possible
interpretation of the results of this study is that the mechanism of action of
clozapine to non-refractory to treatment schizophrenia may be different to
treatment-resistant schizophrenia. the treatment-resistant schizophrenia and
non-refractory treatment schizophrenia may be a respectively special subtype
that is closely associated with mechanism of action of clozapine. another
possible interpretation for the difference may be genetic heterogeneity of
schizophrenia that causes the mechanism of action of drugs differently. lichter
et al. (1993) further studied the exon 3 polymorphism and found 25 alleles,
different from each other not only in the number of the 48 base-pair repeats
but also in base-pair sequence. however, there was ethnic heterogeneity in
allele variation in the  xxxg658xxx  gene in schizophrenia (lung et al., 2002). so
the results of studies should be different in different ethnic populations.
in addition, genetic variations in pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics may influence therapeutic response. in pharmacokinetics, especially, the
genetic variation of metabolism ability among individuals may affect clozapine
levels in blood and in the area where it binds to neurotransmitter receptors.
another important consideration is controlling for dosing or plasma levels of
clozapine given that a threshold plasma concentration exists that predicts
response (schulte, 2003). specifically, plasma clozapine concentrations in
the range of 200 to 420 ng/ml have been found to be optimal for most
treatment-refractory patients to attain antipsychotic response (masellis et al.‚
2000). some studies attempted to control for this factor by ensuring that the
mean doses among genotypic groups were not significantly different and
other studies did not control for these effects. this study assessed clozapine
plasma levels directly to ensure that patients were compliant and met minimum threshold levels that predict response. the clozapine plasma concentration in the present study is from 247.9 ng/ml to 1642.3 ng/ml. the clozapine
blood levels of all patients were higher than 200 ng/ml. so, this study basically eliminated the influence of the genetic variations in pharmacokinetics.
t. crow (1980) suggested that schizophrenia can be divided into type i
and type ii. type i is characterized by positive symptoms more frequently,

good response to typical antipsychotics and eumesia, whereas major clinical
situations of type ii are negative symptoms, poor response to typical antipsychotics, and pour outcome. it is evident that schizophrenia may be present
at different pathogenesis. although clozapine can alleviate both the positive
symptoms and negative symptoms of schizophrenia, there may be difference
in the two symptoms. therefore, schizophrenia patients were divided into
two groups according to the response to positive symptoms or negative symptoms
in order to further analysis. but no positive associations were found between
the 48 bp vntr polymorphism in the  xxxg658xxx  gene and response to clozapine.
in summary‚ the results of this study suggest that inherited variants of
d4 may explain some of the interindividual variation seen in patient response
to clozapine.
