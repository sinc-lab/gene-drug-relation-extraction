hepatic  xxxg102xxx  activity and oxalate metabolism in  xxxd3049xxx  deficient rats.  urinary oxalate has an important role in the formation of calcium oxalate stone and approximately 50% to 60% of urinary oxalate is derived from the endogenous metabolism of glyoxylate. glyoxylate is enzymatically converted to glycine by  xxxg102xxx  in the liver and  xxxd3049xxx  has a key role as a coenzyme. therefore, we evaluated hepatic  xxxg102xxx  activity and oxalate metabolism in  xxxd3049xxx  deficient rats.
