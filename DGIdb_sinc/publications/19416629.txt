we have investigated the muscarinic receptor subtype(s) mediating the release of urinary bladder-derived
relaxant factor that is demonstrated by a coaxial bioassay system. acetylcholine-induced relaxation of a
precontracted anococcygeus muscle mounted within the bladder was considered as an evidence for the
release of this factor. m1 -muscarinic agonist mcn-a-343 and the cholinesterase inhibitor physostigmine
also elicited relaxation responses in the coaxial bioassay besides acetylcholine. acetylcholine-induced
relaxation was antagonized by the subtype-selective muscarinic antagonists (pkb ): m3 -antagonist  xxxd1813xxx  (9.36 ± 0.11), m3 /m1 -antagonist 4-damp (9.30 ± 0.11), m1 -antagonist telenzepine (8.56 ± 0.21),
m4 -antagonist  xxxd3450xxx  (6.63 ± 0.17) and m2 -antagonist af-dx 116 (6.01 ± 0.21). the pkb values of
these antagonists have suggested that stimulation of m1 - and m3 -muscarinic receptors in the bladder wall mediates the release of urinary bladder-derived relaxant factor. in addition, mcn-a-343,
by activating the facilitatory m1 receptors and physostigmine by inhibiting the acetylcholinesterase
may induce the release of this factor through endogenous acetylcholine in the coaxial bioassay system.

1. introduction
the muscarinic receptors of the urinary bladder are heterogeneous and are found on the detrusor muscle, the parasympathetic
nerve endings and the urothelium of the bladder. detrusor muscle possesses both muscarinic m2 and  xxxg449xxx  subtypes, and
although m2 subtype is the predominant receptor at the protein
level, m3 subtype has been identiﬁed as the major receptor mediating the contractile response [1]. the contraction of the detrusor
through stimulation of m3 receptors involves the entry of extracellular calcium through l-type channels and activation of a  xxxg1969xxx 
[2,3]. the stimulation of  xxxg448xxx  facilitates the m3 -mediated
contractions and reverses the relaxation response induced by
camp-dependent beta-adrenoceptor stimulation in the detrusor
muscle [4,5]. muscarinic receptors on the parasympathetic nerve
endings of the bladder are m1 and m2 /m4 subtypes and they regulate the transmitter release. thus, stimulation of m1 -muscarinic
receptors enhances the acetylcholine release through activation of
protein kinase c and l-type calcium channels whereas m2 /m4 muscarinic receptors are inhibitory and are negatively coupled
to adenylate cyclase [6–9]. the urothelium of the urinary bladder expresses all muscarinic receptor subtypes (m1 –m5 ) [1,10,11].

several studies from different species reported that all of these
muscarinic receptor subtypes were distributed in different layers of
the urothelium which might also indicate their impact on bladder
functions [11,12].
the muscarinic receptors in the bladder wall are also involved
in the release of the bladder-derived relaxant factor that is demonstrated by a coaxial bioassay system in vitro. the coaxial bioassay
consists of an assay tissue, i.e. rat aorta or anococcygeus muscle
that is enveloped by the rat bladder, and this assembly involves
the release of the relaxant factor from the donor bladder by muscarinic agonists and its diffusion to the assay tissue to exert its
effect [13,14]. the nature of bladder-derived relaxant factor and the
muscarinic receptor subtype involves in its release are not known.
however, it has been shown that it is not originated from the
urothelium and it is not a cyclooxygenase product,  xxxd2738xxx  or
endothelium-derived hyperpolarizing factor (edhf) [13–15]. our
previous studies have shown that it is not one of the peptides
present in the afferent neurons of the bladder or a purinergic
mediator [16] but tetrodotoxin-resistant intramural neurons of the
bladder seems to be involved in its release [15]. moreover, adenylate cyclase and  xxxg1836xxx  play a role as second messengers
in its release or relaxant effect [16]. in the present study, we have
investigated the muscarinic receptor subtype(s) that mediates the
release of urinary bladder-derived relaxant factor. for this purpose,
the effects of subtype-selective muscarinic receptor antagonists
were evaluated on acetylcholine-induced relaxation response in the
coaxial bioassay system.

2. materials and methods
hacettepe university animal ethics committee (no: 2004/72-2)
has approved the present study. forty-eight male sprague–dawley
rats (250–300 g) were killed by a sharp blow to the head and
bleeding, and the urinary bladder and anococcygeus muscles were
isolated.
2.1. coaxial bioassay system
the urinary bladder was used as the donor organ and the anococcygeus muscle was the assay tissue in the coaxial bioassay system.
the anococcygeus muscle was placed in the lumen of the bladder through small cuts made at the bladder neck and dome, and
mounted under a resting tension of 1 g in an organ bath ﬁlled
with krebs–henseleit solution. isometric changes in the tension
of anococcygeus muscle were recorded with an isometric force
transducer and “may 95-transducer data acquisition system” on
an ibm-compatible computer. the bladder that freely enveloped the
anococcygeus muscle was not attached to the recording transducer.
the composition of the krebs–henseleit solution was (in mm):
nacl, 113; kcl, 4.7;  xxxd2534xxx  , 1.2; cacl2 , 2.5; kh2 po4 , 1.2; nahco3 ,
25.0; glucose, 11.6 and gassed with 95% o2 –5% co2 at 37 ◦ c and ph
7.4. tissues were equilibrated for 1 h and the baths were washed by
krebs–henseleit solution every 15 min before each experimental
procedure. the test drugs were introduced directly into the organ
bath by an automated pipette in a volume of 50 ␮l. in all experiments the urothelium was denuded mechanically, and its removal
leaving the underlying lamina propria intact was conﬁrmed by histological examination.
in the ﬁrst group of experiments, the effects of muscarinic receptor antagonists were tested in the coaxial bioassay system. for this
purpose, the anococcygeus muscle mounted within the bladder was
precontracted by 1–3 ␮m phenylephrine (60–80% of the maximum)
and then, the concentration-dependent relaxation response to
acetylcholine (10 nm–1 mm) was obtained by cumulative addition
to the organ bath. after eliciting the ﬁrst concentration–response
curve, the tissues were washed by krebs–henseleit solution every
15 min for an hour and incubated (30 min) with either of the
muscarinic receptor antagonists; telenzepine (100 nm), af-dx 116
(10 ␮m), 4-damp (10 nm),  xxxd1813xxx  (10 nm) or  xxxd3450xxx 
(10 ␮m). then, the anococcygeus muscle in the coaxial bioassay was
precontracted again by phenylephrine (1–3 ␮m) and the second
concentration–response curve to acetylcholine was constructed
in the presence of the antagonist tested as described above. the
incubation with these antagonists did not alter phenylephrineinduced precontraction level of the anococcygeus muscle and each
antagonist effect on acetylcholine-induced relaxation response was
studied in individual coaxial bioassay preparations. furthermore,
the preliminary coaxial bioassay experiments have shown that
two consecutive concentration–response curves to acetylcholine
obtained at 1 h intervals was not signiﬁcantly different (data not
shown).
in another group of experiments, the potency of m1 -selective
muscarinic receptor agonist, mcn-a-343 was evaluated and compared to that of acetylcholine in the coaxial bioassay system. thus,
the ﬁrst concentration–response curve was elicited with acetylcholine in precontracted anococcygeus muscle mounted within
the bladder as described above. then, the tissues were washed
by krebs–henseleit solution every 15 min for an hour and again
after precontraction with phenylephrine, the relaxation response
to cumulatively added mcn-a-343 (1 ␮m–1 mm) was obtained as
the second concentration–response curve in the coaxial bioassay.
in a group of experiments, the effect of acetylcholine and mcn-a343 was also examined in precontracted anococcygeus muscle after
removal of the donor bladder from the organ bath.

301

the effect of physostigmine, the cholinesterase inhibitor was
evaluated in the coaxial bioassay system in another group of experiments. after an hour of equilibration period and washout by
krebs–henseleit solution every 15 min physostigmine  xxxd1891xxx  ␮m
concentration was introduced to the organ bath and its response
was recorded in precontracted (phenylephrine, 1–3 ␮m) anococcygeus muscle mounted within the bladder. physostigmine (10 ␮m)
response was also elicited after incubation (30 min) with atropine
(100 nm) or after removal of the donor bladder from the organ
bath as described above. each physostigmine effect was tested in
individual preparations.
2.2. statistical analysis
in the coaxial bioassay experiments, the relaxation responses
elicited by the agonists are expressed as the percentage of papaverine (100 ␮m)-induced relaxation. papaverine was added to the
organ bath after obtaining the maximum agonist response and
induced ∼100% relaxation relative to the precontraction elicited by
phenylephrine.
in all experiments, the concentrations to achieve half-maximum
(ec50 ) and maximum (emax ) responses were obtained from
individual concentration–response curves. ec50 values were
given as pd2 values (pd2 = −log ec50 ). the pkb values of muscarinic receptor antagonists were calculated by the equation
pkb = −log([antagonists]/(cr − 1)). cr represented the “concentration ratio” which was determined from ec50 values in the presence
and absence of the antagonist [17].
data were expressed as mean ± standard error of the mean
(s.e.m.) and analysed by graphpad prism3 software. statistics was
done by using paired student’s t-test and the ﬁrst and second
concentration–response curves to agonists elicited consecutively
in the coaxial bioassay system were compared. statistics of the
physostigmine data was done by unpaired student’s t-test. a p value
of less than 0.05 was considered signiﬁcant.
2.3. drugs and drug solutions
acetylcholine chloride, phenylephrine hydrochloride, atropine
sulfate salt monohydrate, papaverine hydrochloride,  xxxd2940xxx , telenzepine dihydrochloride hydrate, 4-damp (4diphenylacetoxy-n-methylpiperidine) methiodide and mcn-a343 ((4-hydroxy-2-butynyl)-1-trimethylammonium-3-chlorocarbanilate chloride 4-[n-(3-chlorophenyl)carbamoyloxy]-2-butynyltrimethylammonium chloride) were purchased from sigma
(st. louis, mo). af-dx 116 (11-[[2-[(diethylamino)methyl]-1piperidinyl]acetyl]-5,11-dihydro-6h- xxxd3047xxx [2,3-b][1,4]benzodiazepin-6-one) and  xxxd3450xxx  (n-ethyl-3-hydroxy-2-phenyln-(pyridinylmethyl)propanamide) were obtained from tocris.
 xxxd1813xxx  was a special gift of novartis (istanbul, turkey).
stock solutions of all drugs were made in distilled water except
for af-dx 116 and tropcamide which were dissolved in dimethyl
sulfoxide (dmso). the dilutions of the stock solutions were made
with distilled water. dmso at concentrations that match its dilutions did not alter the control responses in the coaxial bioassay
system (data not shown).

study. furthermore, the pkb value estimated for telenzepine was
8.56 ± 0.21. this value was also signiﬁcantly higher than the pkb

the bladder that enveloped the anococcygeus muscle in the organ

the cholinesterase inhibitor physostigmine produced a lagging
relaxation response  xxxd1891xxx  ␮m concentration in the coaxial bioassay system that amounted to 41.3 ± 6.6% (fig. 3a and b) (n = 6). the
relaxation response to physostigmine (10 ␮m) was inhibited signiﬁcantly after incubation with atropine (100 nm) (fig. 3b) (n = 6).
furthermore, physostigmine (10 ␮m) did not induce a relaxation
response in precontracted anococcygeus muscle in the absence of
the donor bladder in the organ bath (fig. 3b) (n = 6).
4. discussion
acetylcholine-induced relaxation response in precontracted
anococygeus muscle mounted within the urinary bladder is considered as an evidence for the release of bladder-derived relaxant
factor in studies using the coaxial bioassay system [13–16]. present
study further conﬁrmed this suggestion as acetylcholine did not
alter the precontraction level of the anococcygeus muscle when
mounted in the absence of the bladder in the organ bath. furthermore, the inhibition of the acetylcholine response by the
nonselective muscarinic receptor antagonist atropine indicated
that the muscarinic receptors in the bladder wall are involved
in its release [16]. the urinary bladder possesses heterogeneous
population of muscarinic receptors as the detrusor muscle has
both m2 and m3 subtypes [4,5] and the cholinergic nerve terminals innervating the urinary bladder have facilitatory-m1 and

304

t.e. bozkurt, i. sahin-erdemli / pharmacological research 59 (2009) 300–305

inhibitory-m2 /m4 muscarinic receptors [6–9]. in the present study,
we have investigated the subtype(s) of muscarinic receptors that
mediates the release of bladder-derived relaxant factor. thus,
the effect of subtype-selective muscarinic receptor antagonists;
m1 -antagonist telenzepine (100 nm), m2 -antagonist af-dx 116
(10 ␮m), m3 /m1 -antagonist 4-damp (10 nm), m3 -antagonist  xxxd1813xxx  (10 nm) and m4 -antagonist  xxxd3450xxx  (10 ␮m) were
evaluated against acetylcholine-induced relaxation response in
precontracted anococcygeus muscle mounted within the bladder.
all of these muscarinic receptor antagonists inhibited the acetylcholine response without altering the maximum relaxation in the
coaxial bioassay but differences in their potencies estimated as the
pkb values were found.
telenzepine is considered as the m1 subtype-selective muscarinic receptor antagonist and has an antagonist proﬁle of
m1 > m4 > m3 > m2 [18,19]. the pkb value of telenzepine was calculated as 8.56 ± 0.21 in the present coaxial bioassay experiments.
this value is in close agreement with the reported pkb of telenzepine for m1 -muscarinic receptor subtype in rabbit vas deferens
(8.86) [20] but not with its pkb values for m2 subtype in left atrium
(7.32) and m3 subtype in rat urinary bladder strips (7.74) against
acetylcholine-induced contractions [21].
af-dx 116 has high afﬁnity for m2 -muscarinic receptors and has
a potency proﬁle of m2 > m1 ≥ m4 > m3 [22,23]. the pkb value of afdx 116 in the coaxial bioassay system was estimated as 6.01 ± 0.21.
this value is not consistent with the pkb of af-dx 116 obtained at
m2 -muscarinic receptors in rabbit vas deferens (7.4), rat left atrium
(7.0) and guinea-pig atrium (7.2) [20,24]. it was also lower than that
reported for m1 -muscarinic receptors in rabbit vas deferens (6.85)
[20]. on the other hand, the published pkb values of af-dx 116 at
m3 -muscarinic receptors in swine myometrium (5.96), rat urinary
bladder (6.32), guinea-pig urinary bladder (6.24) and guinea-pig
trachea (6.24) are close to that found in the present experiments
[5,25–27].
4-damp has high afﬁnity for m3 and m1 receptors and its antagonist proﬁle is given as m3 > m1 ≥ m4 > m2 [18]. the pkb value for
4-damp calculated in the present coaxial bioassay experiments was
9.30 ± 0.11 which is close to its reported values for m3 -muscarinic
receptors in previous studies such as 9.12 in rat urinary bladder and
9.2 in rabbit urinary bladder [26,5]. furthermore, the pkb value of
4-damp obtained in the present study is also close to the values
given for m1 - (8.6–9.2) and m4 - (8.4–9.4) but not for m2 - (7.8–8.4)
muscarinic receptor subtypes in the literature [28].
 xxxd1813xxx  is used as the m3 -muscarinic receptor antagonist
in the present study and its pkb value estimated in the coaxial
bioassay was 9.36 ± 0.11. this value is in good agreement with the
pkb of  xxxd1813xxx  for m3 receptors in guinea-pig urinary bladder
(9.31) [29] and also with other previous studies in the literature
(9.4) [18]. on the other hand, the pkb values of  xxxd1813xxx  at m1 and m2 -muscarinic receptor subtypes were reported as 7.9 and
6.9, respectively, and these values are not comparable with that
obtained in the present study [18,28].
 xxxd3450xxx  has an antagonist proﬁle of m4 > m3 ≥ m2 > m1 and
mostly used to characterize m4 -muscarinic receptors. the pkb value
of  xxxd3450xxx  calculated in our study was 6.63 ± 0.17. this value
is not consistent with the afﬁnity constant of  xxxd3450xxx  for m4
receptor subtype which was reported as 7.54–8.13 [30–32]. furthermore, the pkb values of  xxxd3450xxx  for m1 , m2 and  xxxg449xxx 
subtypes were reported as 7.27, 7.34 and 7.30, respectively in a study
using chinese hamster ovary cells and these values are also not
consistent with the pkb obtained in the present coaxial bioassay
experiments [31].
comparison of the pkb values obtained in the present study to
that reported in the literature indicated that our telenzepine, 4damp and  xxxd1813xxx  data were the evidences for the involvement
of m1 - and m3 -muscarinic receptors, while af-dx 116 and tropi-

 xxxd3450xxx  data excluded the role of m2 and m4 receptors in the release
of bladder-derived relaxant factor.
our experiments with mcn-a-343 also conﬁrmed the involvement of m1 -muscarinic subtypes in the release of bladder-derived
relaxant factor. mcn-a-343 elicited a concentration-dependent
relaxation response in the coaxial bioassay system with a pd2 value
of 3.63 ± 0.09 although it was lower than that of acetylcholine.
it is well known that mcn-a-343 exhibits high afﬁnity for m1 muscarinic receptors [33,34] and m1 subtype is the facilitatory
receptor located on the bladder cholinergic nerve terminals that
regulates the transmitter release [1]. thus, in the coaxial bioassay
experiments mcn-a-343 may activate the m1 -muscarinic receptors
in the donor bladder to induce the release of endogenous acetylcholine which then leads to the release of the bladder-derived
relaxant factor. our experiments with physostigmine further
suggest that endogenous acetylcholine is capable of releasing
bladder-derived relaxant factor. it is well known that physostigmine increases the level of endogenous acetylcholine at cholinergic
nerve terminals by inhibiting the enzyme acetylcholinesterase [35].
in the present study, physostigmine elicited a relaxation response
in the coaxial bioassay system that was inhibited by atropine and
was not observed when anococcygeus muscle was mounted in the
absence of the donor bladder in the organ bath.
in conclusion, the present data suggest that stimulation of the
presinaptic m1 -muscarinic receptors of the bladder cholinergic
nerve terminals and m3 -muscarinic receptors located on the bladder detrusor muscle induce the release of urinary bladder-derived
relaxant factor. in a previous study, we have shown that purinergic p2x receptor agonist  xxxd1911xxx  can also induce
the release of this factor in the coaxial bioassay system [16]. since
stimulation of p2x receptors as well as m1 - and m3 -muscarinic
receptor subtypes are all associated with the contractility of the
detrusor muscle, we may further suggest that the release of the
bladder-derived relaxant factor is concomitant to the contraction
of the urinary bladder.
