 xxxg9xxx , an inherited plasma high density lipoprotein
deficiency. the abnormal accumulation of cholesterol in macrophages of  xxxg9xxx  patients suggested that  xxxg9xxx  is
involved in lipid efflux (1–3). indeed, subsequent studies have
shown that  xxxg9xxx  is required for cholesterol and phospholipids efflux to apolipoproteins such as  xxxg1335xxx -i (4 –7). upon expression of functional  xxxg9xxx  in cultured cells, enhanced binding of
 xxxg1335xxx -i to the plasma membrane and increased cellular cholesterol and phospholipids efflux to  xxxg1335xxx -i have been found. it has
been suggested that  xxxg9xxx  serves as a receptor for docking of
 xxxg1335xxx -i to the plasma membrane. a chemical cross-linking approach revealed complex formation between both proteins (4,
5). the relevance of abca-1 for binding of  xxxg1335xxx -i is supported
by the observation that tangier patients typically fail to bind
nascent  xxxg1335xxx -i (8, 9).
an alternative model suggests that  xxxg9xxx  acts as a lipid
transporter pumping the amino phospholipid phosphatidylserine (ps), which is typically sequestered to the cytoplasmic
leaflet of mammalian plasma membranes to the exoplasmic
leaflet (6, 10). exposure of ps on the exoplasmic plasma membrane leaflet generates a microenvironment facilitating binding of  xxxg173xxx  (7, 8). another recent study also provided a clear
indication that  xxxg9xxx  expression increases cell surface ps
(11). furthermore, the authors (11) found a strong enhancement of  xxxg1335xxx -i binding to apoptotic cells with an elevated level
of exofacial ps. however, this binding was not sufficient to
trigger phospholipid and cholesterol efflux to  xxxg1335xxx -i. thus,
apart from ps, other phospholipids such as phosphatidylcholine (pc) might also be transported by  xxxg9xxx  to enable lipid
removal from the plasma membrane to  xxxg1335xxx -i (12). this is
supported by wang et al. (13) who concluded a direct transport
of both cholesterol and phospholipids via  xxxg9xxx .
the lipid transport activity of  xxxg9xxx  may also be involved in
other cellular processes as endocytosis. an enhanced endocytotic activity in  xxxg9xxx  cells has been associated with
an impairment of ps exposure (14).
from these studies, it appears that  xxxg9xxx -mediated surface
exposure of lipids is of rather low specificity. however, so far no
systematic study on  xxxg9xxx -dependent lipid exposure has been
done. here we investigated the exposure of endogenous ps and
various fluorescent lipid analogues in the plasma membrane of
 xxxg9xxx -expressing mdckii cells. in order to correlate directly
the expression of  xxxg9xxx  and exposure of endogenous ps,
 xxxg9xxx -gfp, which has been shown to be fully functional with
respect to wild type  xxxg9xxx  (15), was expressed in mdckii
cells. we observed an  xxxg9xxx -mediated redistribution of amino
phospholipid analogues of phosphatidylserine and phosphatifluorescence-activated cell sorter; ha, hemagglutinin; anova, analysis of variance; fcs, fetal calf serum.

 xxxg9xxx  has been established to be required for the
efflux of cholesterol and phospholipids to apolipoproteins such as  xxxg1335xxx -i. at present, it is unclear whether
 xxxg9xxx -mediated lipid exposure is specific with regard
to lipid headgroups and whether it requires calcium
activation and the presence of a lipid acceptor. in the
present work, we found exofacial exposure of endogenous phosphatidylserine in the absence of  xxxg1335xxx -i to be
enhanced in  xxxg9xxx -gfp expressing mdckii and hela
cells compared with control cells. by using c6-n-(7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazol-4-yl) (nbd)-labeled phospholipid analogues, we observed elevated redistribution of
phosphatidylserine and phosphatidylethanolamine but
not of phosphatidylcholine analogues from the cytoplasmic to the exoplasmic leaflet of the plasma membrane of
 xxxg9xxx -gfp expressing cells. whereas  xxxd2215xxx  affected neither the level of exofacial endogenous ps nor
the outward movement of the amino phospholipid analogues, the latter was sensitive to intracellular ca2ⴙ in
 xxxg9xxx -gfp expressing cells, further enhancing outward analogue redistribution with respect to control
cells. both receptor-mediated endocytosis and fluidphase endocytosis were reduced in mdckii cells expressing  xxxg9xxx -gfp.  xxxd2215xxx  raised the level of receptor-mediated endocytosis in the  xxxg9xxx -gfp
expressing cell to the level of control cells in the absence
of  xxxd2215xxx . in control cells, however, fluid-phase endocytosis but not receptor-mediated endocytosis was
significantly reduced upon  xxxd2215xxx  treatment.

 xxxg9xxx -mediated lipid exposure

dylethanolamine from the cytoplasmic side to the exoplasmic
plasma membrane leaflet. the enhanced surface exposure of
the ps analogue is in line with the higher level of exofacial
endogenous ps in comparison with control cells, which was
confirmed for  xxxg9xxx -gfp expressing hela cells. in contrast
to the amino phospholipid analogues, we did not find an enhanced surface exposure for the phosphatidylcholine analogue
in  xxxg9xxx -gfp expressing cells. in parallel, we investigated
the endocytotic activity observing that the down-regulated receptor-mediated and fluid-phase endocytosis in  xxxg9xxx -gfp
expressing cells cannot solely be linked to the lipid transport
activity of  xxxg9xxx .

materials—diisopropyl  xxxd3217xxx  (dfp), fatty acid-free bovine  xxxg124xxx  (bsa), and the calcium ionophore a23187 were
purchased from sigma. a23187 stocks were prepared in  xxxd1896xxx . dulbecco’s phosphate-buffered saline was supplemented with 24
mm glucose and 10 mm hepes (mpbs). 1- xxxd2832xxx -2-[6-(n-(7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazol-4-yl)]-phosphatidic acid (c6-nbd-pa), -pe (c6nbd-pe), and -ps (c6-nbd-ps) were purchased from avanti polar
lipids (birmingham, al); high performance tlc plates were from
merck. apc- xxxg166xxx  and binding buffer were bought from pharmingen;  xxxd3027xxx  was from sigma. triton x-100 and trypsin/edta
were from fluka (buchs, switzerland) and biochrom kg (berlin,
germany), respectively. tetramethylrhodamine-dextran (tmr-dextran) and texas red-transferrin (tr-transferrin) were obtained from
mobitec (göttingen, germany). inhibitors of abc transporters used
were  xxxd2215xxx  (sigma),  xxxd3488xxx  (novartis, basel, switzerland), and
mk 571 (merck).  xxxd2215xxx  and  xxxd3488xxx  stocks were prepared in
 xxxd1896xxx  or ethanol; mk 571 was prepared in double-distilled
water. for all experiments, the effect of the solvent was determined.
cells—cells were cultured in dulbecco’s modified eagle’s medium
(dmem, invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (fcs,
invitrogen), penicillin, streptomycin, and sodium pyruvate (biochrom
kg, berlin, germany). pbi  xxxg9xxx -gfp plasmid (clontech) was constructed as detailed (6). transfection was performed according to the
manufacturer’s procedure. briefly 106 mdckii or hela tet-off (clontech) cells maintained in dmem with 10% fcs were incubated overnight with the transfection mix (5 ␮g of pbi  xxxg9xxx -gfp and 100 ng of
ptk-hyg mixed to 20 ␮l of exgen 500 in 0.15 m nacl). after transfection, cells were trypsinized and seeded into 10-cm culture dishes. transfection efficiency was monitored by flow cytometry (facscan, bd biosciences) before seeding. hygromycin b selection (200 ␮g/ml,
invitrogen) was started 48 h after transfection. three-week-old individual cell clones were picked with cloning cylinders and expanded subsequently on the basis of gfp-positive cells visualized by fluorescence
microscopy (passage 0).
cells were regularly passed before complete confluence to reduce loss
of expression. cells were grown in the absence or presence of cytostatic
drugs for 24 or 72 h on 35-mm culture dishes (nunc, wiesbaden,
germany) for transport assays, and on two-chamber cover glasses
(nunc) for microscopy.
expression of ha-gfp—mdckii cells (50% confluent) were grown in
dmem supplemented with 10% fcs. influenza virus hemagglutinin
(strain x31) tagged with a gfp at the c terminus (ha-gfp) in vector
ptm1 was expressed by using vaccinia virus t7 system (16). cells were
washed and infected with modified vaccinia virus (vtf7–3 virus) with a
multiplicity of infection of ⬃2.5 and incubated at 37 °c with 5% co2 for
1 h. the virus inoculum was removed, and the cells were washed once
with dmem without fcs. subsequently, cells were transfected with a
mixture of 6 ␮l of cdna (1.2 ␮g/␮l) and 30 ␮l of lipofectin (1 ␮g/␮l)
according to the manufacturer’s instructions (invitrogen). incubation
was continued at 37 °c for another 2 h. upon removal of medium and
substituting with dmem with 2% fcs medium, cells were incubated at
31 °c for 24 h. as controls, mdckii cells were taken that have undergone the whole transfection procedure but without the ha-gfp cdna.
inward redistribution of c6-nbd-ps and -pe—cells were washed
and labeled with 1 ml of 10 ␮m c6-nbd-ps or -pe in ice-cold mpbs (17,
18). after incubation on ice for 20 min, non-inserted analogues were
removed by washing two times with cold mpbs. inward redistribution
of analogues was initiated by addition of mpbs prewarmed to 20 °c
(with or without inhibitors), containing 5 mm dfp (as in all following
incubations) to prevent hydrolysis of analogues (19). after 30 min,
culture dishes were transferred on ice, and cold mpbs containing bsa
(final 2%, w/v) was added to extract nbd lipid analogues from the

exoplasmic leaflet. c6-nbd-lipids present in the outer leaflet, not in the
inner leaflet, of the plasma membrane have been shown to be selectively extracted by incubation with an excess of bsa (referred to as back
exchange) (20 –23). phospholipids with two long fatty acid chains as
endogenous phospholipids, for example, are not extracted by bsa. after
10 min, bsa-containing media were collected, and back exchange was
repeated with cold mpbs plus 2% bsa for 10 min, followed by lipid
analysis of cells and media.
measurement of outward redistribution of c6-nbd-ps and -pe by
direct labeling—cells were labeled with 1 ml of 10 ␮m c6-nbd-ps or
-pe on ice and incubated at 20 °c for 30 min to allow inward movement
of the nbd lipid analogues as described above. inhibitors (200 ␮m
 xxxd2215xxx ; 25 ␮m mk 571; 10 ␮m  xxxd3488xxx ) and a23187 (0.5 ␮m) in
me2so were added 20 min after the beginning of the incubation at
20 °c. nbd lipid analogues remaining on the cell surface were extracted twice by incubation with bsa (2% (w/v)) in mpbs for 10 min on
ice. after removing the second bsa-containing medium, cells were
washed twice with cold mpbs. for t ⫽ 0 min, cold medium containing
2% (w/v) bsa and 5 mm dfp in mpbs with or without inhibitor was
added to the cell dish and incubated for 10 min on ice. to measure
c6-nbd-ps or -pe outward transport, prewarmed (15 or 37 °c) mpbs
with 2% (w/v) bsa and 5 mm dfp was added to the dish, and cells were
incubated at 15 or 37 °c for 30 min. removal of the bsa-containing
media and a second extraction with 2% bsa in mpbs for 10 min on ice
terminated incubations, followed by lipid analysis.
measurement of outward redistribution of c6-nbd-pc biosynthetically produced from c6-nbd-pa—c6-nbd-pc was biosynthetically
produced from c6-nbd-pa, and its transport to the exoplasmic leaflet
of the plasma membrane was assessed at 15 °c as described by van
helvoort et al. (23). briefly, cells were incubated at 15 °c with 1 ml of 25
␮m c6-nbd-pa in mpbs. after 180 min, analogues on the exoplasmic
leaflet (c6-nbd-pa and respective metabolites) were removed by washing cells two times with 2% (w/v) bsa-containing mpbs for 10 min on
ice. subsequently, cells were incubated at 15 °c in 2% (w/v) bsa containing mpbs. after 30 min, the amount of extracted analogues was
determined as described below.
lipid analysis—after the incubations, the second bsa back exchange medium was pooled with the first, and cells were scraped into
mpbs. for c6-nbd-ps analysis, lipids from both scraped cells and
media were extracted with  xxxd2400xxx  (5.5 ml per 1 ml of medium)
to prevent substantial loss into the aqueous phase. samples were centrifuged at 780 ⫻ g for 5 min, and the supernatant was transferred into
new glass tubes and dried. for c6-nbd-pc and -pe analysis, lipids
from both cells and incubation media were extracted by the method of
bligh and dyer (24) using 20 mm acetic acid in the aqueous phase. after
two-dimensional separation (i, chloroform, methanol, 25% ammonium
hydroxide (65:25:4, v/v); ii, chloroform/acetone/methanol/acetic acid/
water (10:4:2:2:1, v/v)) on tlc plates, fluorescent lipid spots were
visualized under ultraviolet light, scraped, and quantified as described
before (17, 18).
annexin assay—cells were washed two times with mpbs,
trypsinized (by addition of trypsin/edta for 15 min at 37 °c), and
washed again two times. to measure exposure of endogenous ps on the
cell surface, about 105 cells were incubated on ice for 10 min in the dark
with 5 ␮l of apc- xxxg166xxx  in 0.5 ml of binding buffer (10 mm hepes,
140 mm nacl, 2.5 mm cacl2). cells were washed and resuspended in 0.5
ml of binding buffer containing 1 ␮l of 1 mg/ml aqueous  xxxd3027xxx 
iodide stock for 1 min on ice. measurement was performed with a
facscalibur flow cytometer equipped with a ar⫹ laser (488 nm) and a
diode laser (630 nm) (bd biosciences). forward and side scatter were
set at a linear scale. the following fluorescence channels (log scale)
were used: fl1 (530/30, enhanced gfp),  xxxd752xxx  (585/42,  xxxd3027xxx ,
pe), fl3 (670lp,  xxxd3027xxx ), and fl4 (661/16, apc- xxxg166xxx ).
compensation parameters were as follows: fl1, 1.2%  xxxd752xxx ;  xxxd752xxx , 23.9%
fl1;  xxxd752xxx , 0.0% fl3; fl3, 14%  xxxd752xxx ; fl3, 0.5% fl4; and fl4, 16.4%
fl3. threshold was set at 72 fcs-h. data were analyzed by cellquest
pro software.
endocytosis—cells grown on chambered cover glasses were washed
with mpbs, 1 ml of 2 mg of bsa in dmem containing 20 mm hepes
was added, and cells were incubated for 10 min at 37 °c. after washing
cells twice in mpbs, cells were labeled with 1 ml of 5 mg/ml tmrdextran (“fluid-phase” endocytosis) or 1 ml of 0.2 mg/ml tr-transferrin
(receptor-mediated endocytosis) in dmem containing 20 mm hepes,
for 30 min at 37 °c. after removal of supernatant, cells were washed
four times with mpbs and fixed for 10 min on ice in the presence of 3%
paraformaldehyde. cells were washed twice with mpbs, and intracellular uptake of fluorophore was visualized by fluorescence microscopy
(inverse standard microscope equipped with a plan-neofluar ⫻100 (1.3

 xxxg9xxx -mediated lipid exposure

na) objective) and quantified employing the software package metamorph software (version 6.1, universal imaging). the barrier filter sets
(carl zeiss, oberkochen, germany) used were as follows: green fluorescence (nbd, gfp): bp 450 – 490 excitation filter, ft 510 dichroic mirror, and lp 520 emission filter; red fluorescence: bp 546 excitation
filter, ft 580 dichroic mirror, and lp 590 emission filter. each cell was
defined as a region of interest, and its average fluorescence intensity
was determined. background fluorescence, assessed by quantification
of fluorescence intensity in cell free regions, was subtracted.
fluorescence microscopy—trypsinized cells (106) were seeded on
35-mm culture dishes with cover glass bottoms (mattek, ashland, ma)
and grown for 1 day. images were taken using a zeiss lsm 510 confocal
microscope (magnification ⫻63) with zeiss software. to assess intracellular localization of  xxxg9xxx -gfp, the fluorescent markers mitotracker
redcmxros (mitochondrial marker) and tetramethylx-wheat germ
agglutinin (golgi marker) (molecular probes, leiden, the netherlands)
were employed.
statistical analysis—results are presented as means ⫾ s.e., if not
stated otherwise, and were analyzed statistically using a two-way
anova (jandel sigmastat 2.0) considering treatment and day of experiment. differences were considered significant for p ⬍ 0.05.
results

expression and localization of  xxxg9xxx -gfp—expression of
 xxxg9xxx -gfp in nonpolarized mdckii cells and hela cells was
assessed by facs analysis. two populations of cells differing
in their level of  xxxg9xxx -gfp expression were distinguished
(fig. 1, only shown for mdckii cells). about 20% of mdckii
and 30% of hela cells expressed  xxxg9xxx -gfp at a high level
(gfp-high, table i), whereas the remaining cells showed only
a low level or no expression of  xxxg9xxx -gfp (gfp-low). staining

of cells with the membrane-impermeable nucleic acid stain
 xxxd3027xxx  (pi) did not correlate with gfp fluorescence
intensity (fig. 1). thus, viability of cells was not impaired by
expression of  xxxg9xxx -gfp.
expression of  xxxg9xxx -gfp was dependent on number of cell
passages. for example, the number of highly  xxxg9xxx -gfp expressing mdckii cells declined by about 50 and 70% after the
first and second passage, respectively. a similar effect was
observed for hela cells (data not shown).
 xxxg9xxx -gfp was localized to the plasma membrane in mdckii and hela cells (fig. 2). cross-section images show that
 xxxg9xxx -gfp is expressed in the plasma membrane with no
difference between the side facing the dish and the opposite
side. as revealed from co-labeling with tetramethylx-wheat
germ agglutinin (not shown),  xxxg9xxx -gfp was also found in
the golgi apparatus. when mdckii cells were allowed to reach
confluency and to polarize,  xxxg9xxx -gfp distributed preferentially to the basolateral domain of the plasma membrane in line
with previous observations (see refs. 6 and 15 and data not
shown). however, for our studies only nonpolarized cells were
used. both cell lines did not express endogenous  xxxg9xxx  as
shown previously (6) and were verified by immunoblotting
(data not shown).
c6-nbd-ps outward redistribution is enhanced in abca1gfp expressing mdckii cells—to study outward redistribution of c6-nbd-ps from the cytoplasmic to the exoplasmic
leaflet of the plasma membrane, the cytoplasmic side was labeled following the approach of pohl et al. (18). to this end,
cells were incubated for 30 min at 20 °c upon incorporation of
ps analogues into the exoplasmic leaflet (see “experimental
procedures”). during this period, analogues rapidly redistributed to the cytoplasmic side mediated by an amino phospholipid translocase activity present in the plasma membrane of
mdckii cells (17). analogues remaining on the exoplasmic
leaflet were removed by repeated washing with bsa. about
50% of analogues became internalized in control cells. we observed a slightly reduced amount of intracellularly localized
analogues for  xxxg9xxx -gfp expressing cells with respect to
control cells after no passage or one passage of cells. the ratio
of internalized analogues between  xxxg9xxx -gfp expressing and
control cells was 0.83 ⫾ 0.13 (mean ⫾ s.e.; n ⫽ 3). however,
the difference between  xxxg9xxx -gfp expressing cells and control cells disappeared when cells were used after three culturing passages correlating with the decline of  xxxg9xxx -gfp expressing cells (see above).
subsequently, to follow outward redistribution of analogues,
cells were continuously incubated at 37 or 15 °c in bsa-containing medium. any analogue reaching the cell surface was
extracted by bsa into the suspension medium. the kinetics of
outward redistribution at 37 °c are shown in fig. 3.
for control cells, about 50% of analogues originally located
intracellularly became accessible to bsa within 30 min of incubation at 37 °c. at any time point measured, exposure of
c6-nbd-ps to the exoplasmic leaflet was significantly higher
(anova, p ⬍ 0.05) for  xxxg9xxx -gfp expressing cells with respect to control cells (fig. 3a).
when outward redistribution was measured for 30 min at
15 °c, only 30% of analogues could be extracted. however,
exposure of c6-nbd-ps was also enhanced in  xxxg9xxx -gfp
expressing cells and was even more pronounced in comparison to 37 °c (fig. 4, passage 0, and fig. 5). at this temperature (15 °c) vesicular transport is abolished (25), suggesting
that the enhanced exposure of the ps analogue in abca1gfp expressing cells is related to redistribution from
the cytoplasmic leaflet. the differences between  xxxg9xxx -gfp
expressing cells and control cells cannot be explained by

cell-dependent hydrolysis of analogues, which was similar
for  xxxg9xxx -gfp expressing and control cells (data not
shown).
differences in outward redistribution between abca1gfp expressing and control cells depended on the number of
passages. usually, after two passages the exposure of c6nbd-ps in  xxxg9xxx -gfp expressing cells was reduced to the
level of control cells (fig. 4) mostly due to a reduction in the
number of  xxxg9xxx -gfp expressing cells (see above). very
likely,  xxxg9xxx -gfp expressing cells grow at a slower rate
than non-expressing cells.
after labeling of cells with c6-nbd-ps, inward redistribution and outward translocation of analogues was also followed
by fluorescence microscopy (images not shown). upon labeling
of cells on ice, only the plasma membrane became fluorescent.
nbd fluorescence was much more intense than gfp fluorescence. after incubation of cells at 20 °c for 30 min and subsequent bsa extraction of analogues from the exoplasmic leaflet,
bright labeling of the cytoplasm was observed. further incubation of cells for 30 min at 15 or 37 °c in the presence of bsa (see
above) led to a significant reduction of intracellular fluorescence, in agreement with an outward movement of the ana-

logues and their extraction onto bsa. unfortunately, rapid
bleaching of nbd fluorescence did not allow us to quantify and
compare intracellular fluorescence between control and
 xxxg9xxx -gfp expressing cells.

expressing cells. similar observations were made in the presence of the  xxxg10xxx  ( xxxg10xxx  pgp) inhibitor  xxxd3488xxx  (10 ␮m) and
the  xxxg13xxx  (mrp1) inhibitor mk-571 (25 ␮m) (not shown).
thus, in all cases the ratio of exposed c6-nbd-ps between
 xxxg9xxx -gfp expressing and control cells was not affected (fig.
5; only shown for  xxxd2215xxx ).
upon pretreatment of cells with the calcium ionophore
a23187, significantly enhanced (anova, p ⬍ 0.05) exposure of
c6-nbd-ps in the presence of 2 mm ca2⫹ was found for
 xxxg9xxx -gfp expressing cells (fig. 5). the ratio of extracted
c6-nbd-ps between  xxxg9xxx -gfp expressing and control cells
increased from about 1.25 to 1.6, and was only slightly reduced
in the presence of 200 ␮m  xxxd2215xxx  (fig. 5). a23187 treatment
in medium without ca2⫹ did not affect the outward redistribution of c6-nbd-ps in  xxxg9xxx -gfp expressing and in control
cells (not shown). similarly, neither addition of egta to iono-

analogues. after removal of remaining ps analogues from the exoplasmic leaflet, cells were incubated in the presence of bsa at 37 °c. after various
time points, the amount of extracted analogues was measured. for details see “experimental procedures.” data represent mean ⫾ range of a
typical experiment in duplicate.

phore-treated cells in the absence of ca2⫹ nor addition of
ca2⫹ to cells without ionophore led to increased exposure of
the ps analogue (data not shown). thus, whereas a23187
was dispensable in order to observe an influence of  xxxg9xxx  on
c6-nbs-ps exposure in our experiments, we found it to stimulate exposure in  xxxg9xxx -gfp expressing cells but not in controls.
similar observations have been made for  xxxg9xxx -expressing
hela cells (6, 26).
c6-nbd-pe outward redistribution is enhanced in
 xxxg9xxx -gfp expressing mdckii cells—subsequent to incubation of cells labeled with c6-nbd-ps, we observed significant metabolic conversion into c6-nbd-pe. about 25 and 50%
of intracellularly localized c6-nbd-ps were converted into
c6-nbd-pe at 15 and 37 °c, respectively, with no significant
difference between  xxxg9xxx -gfp expressing and control cells.
the extent of outward redistribution of c6-nbd-pe was much
lower with respect to c6-nbd-ps. although about 50% of the
ps analogue became exposed after 30 min at 37 °c, the amount
of accessible c6-nbd-pe was in the order of 10%.
similar to the ps analogue, we measured enhanced exposure
(anova, p ⬍ 0.05) of c6-nbd-pe on the exoplasmic leaflet of

amount of extracted analogues between  xxxg9xxx -gfp expressing cells
and control cells at 15 °c is shown (data not shown for 37 °c). data

18 pmol/105 cells and 72 ⫾ 20 pmol/105 cells for control and abca1gfp expressing cells, respectively. for details, see “experimental procedures” and legend to fig. 3.

 xxxg9xxx -gfp expressing cells with respect to control cells
after continuous incubation of cells in bsa-containing medium for 30 min at 37 or 15 °c (fig. 6a). the exposure was
not affected by  xxxd2215xxx  (200 ␮m),  xxxd3488xxx  (10 ␮m), or mk571 (25 ␮m) (not shown). an enhanced but statistically not
significant exposure of c6-nbd-pe in  xxxg9xxx -gfp expressing cells was observed in the presence of a23187 and 2 mm
ca2⫹ (not shown).
in a second approach, cells were labeled with c6-nbd-pe
and incubated for 30 min at 20 °c following the technique used
for c6-nbd-ps. it has been shown previously that the pe
analogue is also rapidly transported to the cytoplasmic leaflet
of the plasma membrane of mdckii cells (17). after removal of
analogues remaining on the exoplasmic leaflet, cells were incubated in bsa-containing medium for 30 min at 37 or 15 °c.
the amount of accessible pe analogue was much higher in
comparison to the previous situation where exposure of metabolically converted c6-nbd-pe was studied. about 80 –90 and
50 –70% of c6-nbd-pe was accessible to bsa at 37 and 15 °c,
respectively. for both temperatures, we found an enhanced
appearance (anova, p ⬍ 0.05) of the pe analogue on the
surface of  xxxg9xxx -gfp expressing cells with respect to control
cells (fig. 6b). however, the difference between both cell lines
was less pronounced in comparison to that measured by exposure
of c6-nbd-pe metabolically converted from the ps analogue.
we surmise that the high fraction of accessible pe analogue may
partly mask the difference between both cell lines.
outward redistribution of c6-nbd-pc is not affected by
expression of  xxxg9xxx -gfp—next, we examined the outward
transport of c6-nbd-pc in  xxxg9xxx -gfp expressing and control mdckii cells. to this end, cells were incubated with c6nbd-pa. this lipid analogue is partially converted to c6-nbddiacylglycerol, which rapidly crosses the plasma membrane
and becomes available for intracellular synthesis of c6nbd-pc (23). transport of the newly synthesized analogues to
the cell surface was measured at 15 °c where vesicular traffic
is blocked (25). after incubation of cells (passage 1) with c6nbd-pa for 120 min at 15 °c and removal of nbd lipid analogues from the exoplasmic leaflet (see “experimental procedures”), cells were incubated for a further 30 min at 15 °c in
the presence of bsa. less than 5% of c6-nbd-pc was extracted into the bsa medium with no significant difference
between the  xxxg9xxx -gfp expressing cell line (3.62 ⫾ 0.22%

with c6-nbd-ps (a) or c6-nbd-pe (b) on ice and incubated for 30 min at 20 °c to allow internalization of analogues. after removal of remaining
analogues on the exoplasmic leaflet, cells were incubated in the presence of bsa at 37 or 15 °c. after 30 min, the amount of extracted pe analogues
was measured. during incubation intracellular c6-nbd-ps is partially converted to c6-nbd-pe (a). for details see “experimental procedures”
and “results.” the ratio of the amount of extracted analogues between  xxxg9xxx -gfp expressing cells and control cells is shown. data represent

we have also measured the amount of c6-nbd-pc extracted
during a 3-h incubation of cells in the presence of bsa at 15 °c,
following labeling with c6-nbd-pa in the presence of bsa.
after this period, the amount of extracted pc analogue was on
the order of about 50 – 60%. again, no significant difference was
seen between control and  xxxg9xxx -gfp expressing cells.
notably, we detected only conversion to c6-nbd-pa into
c6-nbd-pc and c6-nbd-pg. c6-nbd-pa may also be converted metabolically to other lipid analogues, e.g. to c6-nbdpe. however, under our conditions synthesis of the pe analogue was beyond the level allowing quantitative detection.
c6-nbd-ps outward redistribution is also enhanced in
 xxxg9xxx -gfp expressing hela cells—the outward redistribution of c6-nbd-ps was also studied in hela cells by bsa extraction as described (see above). similar to mdckii cells, we
found an enhanced exposure of the fluorescent ps analogue in
2
apart from being converted into c6-nbd-pc, c6-nbd-diacylglycerol has been shown to be metabolized to c6-nbd-pe (22). however, we
observed that the amount of synthesized c6-nbd-pe was about 3– 4
times lower with respect to the pc analogue, and we were not able to
detect extraction c6-nbd-pe by bsa. if any extraction has been occurred, it was beyond the detection level of our approach.

 xxxg9xxx -gfp expressing cells compared with control cells (transfected with irrelevant plasmid but the same vector) (fig. 3b).
no enhanced outward redistribution was found for hela
cells expressing the mutant form of  xxxg9xxx -gfp with impaired
atpase activity because of mutation of the lysine residue in the
consensus motif in both atp binding folds (for details of the
mutant, see ref. 6) (fig. 3b). the fraction of cells expressing
mutant  xxxg9xxx -gfp at a high level was similar to that of wild
type  xxxg9xxx -gfp expressing hela cells (see above). furthermore, mutation did not affect trafficking and localization of the
protein as verified by confocal microscopy (data not shown).
 xxxg9xxx -expressing cells expose more endogenous ps on the
cell surface than controls—exposure of endogenous ps in
mdckii and hela cells (passage 0) was tested by flow cytometry. ps present on the exoplasmic plasma membrane leaflet of
cells was detected by labeling with apc- xxxg166xxx , a high
affinity ps-binding protein (27). to exclude damaged cells,
co-labeling with  xxxd3027xxx  was performed. regions were
set to exclude subcellular particles, and only single cells were
counted (10,000 cells/sample). for  xxxd3027xxx  staining,
an additional gate was set. usually, about 5–10% of cells were
excluded because of staining with  xxxd3027xxx . no difference was observed between control and  xxxg9xxx -gfp express-

 xxxg9xxx -gfp expressing mdckii cells were labeled with c6-nbd-ps on ice and incubated for 30 min at 20 °c to allow internalization of analogues.
 xxxd2215xxx  (200 ␮m), a23817 (0.5 ␮m) and ca2⫹ (2 mm) (final concentrations) were added 20 min after starting the incubation at 20 °c and were
present during all further incubations. control cells were incubated without treatment (a, no treatment). ps analogues remaining on the
exoplasmic leaflet were removed. subsequently, cells were incubated in the presence of bsa at 37 (a and b) or 15 °c (b). after 30 min, the amount
of extracted analogues was measured. for details see “experimental procedures.” the ratio of the amount of extracted analogues between
 xxxg9xxx -gfp expressing cells and control cells is shown. all treatments did not affect exposure of ps in control cells compared with nontreated
controls. data represent means ⫾ s.e. of at least three independent experiments in duplicate.

ing cells (see above, fig. 1, e and f). simultaneously, gfp fluorescence was measured (see above). low or no  xxxg9xxx -gfp
expressing mdckii and hela cells bound about 2.5- and 3.1-fold
more, whereas high  xxxg9xxx -gfp-expressing cells bound 3.5- and
4.1-fold more apc- xxxg166xxx  than control cells, respectively (fig.
7, a and b). thus, binding of apc- xxxg166xxx  was significantly
enhanced for  xxxg9xxx -gfp expressing cells with respect to control
cells and did correlate with the extent of  xxxg9xxx -gfp expression,
which was not observed for hela cells expressing mutant
 xxxg9xxx -gfp with impaired atpase activity (see above, data not
shown). there are no indications that  xxxd2215xxx  affected apcannexin v binding neither for control nor for  xxxg9xxx -gfp expressing cells (data not shown). consistent with the observation
presented in fig. 4, the difference in  xxxg166xxx  binding between
 xxxg9xxx -gfp expressing and control cells declined with increasing numbers of cell culture passages (data not shown).
to verify that enhanced exposure of endogenous ps is related
to the activity of  xxxg9xxx -gfp but not simply because of expression of a gfp-tagged membrane protein, we investigated binding of apc- xxxg166xxx  to mdckii cells expressing influenza
virus hemagglutinin (ha-gfp; see “experimental procedures”). no difference of apc- xxxg166xxx  binding was observed
between ha-gfp expressing cells and control cells that were
treated according to the transfection procedure but without the
ha-gfp plasmid (fig. 7c).
receptor-mediated and “fluid-phase” endocytosis is reduced in  xxxg9xxx -gfp expressing mdckii cells—recently,
the enhanced endocytosis in tangier fibroblasts has been associated with the activity of  xxxg9xxx  (14). therefore, we investigated whether expression of  xxxg9xxx -gfp in mdckii cells
affects endocytosis. transferrin is known to be taken up by
clathrin-coated pits upon binding to surface receptors (28).
cells were incubated with texas red-labeled transferrin for 30
min at 37 °c. internalization of transferrin was seen by punctate structures corresponding to endosomes (not shown). quantification of intracellular fluorescence revealed a significantly
lower amount (anova, p ⬍ 0.05) of internalized transferrin in

expressing cells were incubated with tr-transferrin (a) or tmr-dextran (b) for 30 min at 37 °c with or without  xxxd2215xxx  (200 ␮m). cells
were then fixed for fluorescence microscopy. uptake of fluorescent
markers was quantified by measuring intracellular fluorescence using
the software metamorph. for details see “experimental procedures.”
the amount of internalized marker of control cells (no treatment) was
set to 100% for each experiment. the means ⫾ s.e. of at least three
independent experiments is shown.

 xxxg9xxx -gfp expressing cells in comparison to control cells
(fig. 8a). reduced endocytosis cannot be explained by a lower
binding of fluorescent transferrin to the plasma membrane of
 xxxg9xxx -gfp expressing cells. the amount of transferrin bound
to the plasma membrane after incubation for 30 min on ice was
similar to control and  xxxg9xxx -gfp expressing cells (not
shown). in the presence of  xxxd2215xxx  (200 ␮m), uptake of transferrin increased to the level of control cells, which was not
affected by the inhibitor.
to assess fluid-phase endocytosis, cells were incubated with
a tetramethylrhodamine-labeled high molecular weight dextran for 30 min at 37 °c. similar to transferrin, uptake of
dextran was significantly reduced (anova, p ⬍ 0.05) in
 xxxg9xxx -gfp expressing cells (fig. 8b). addition of  xxxd2215xxx 
raised the amount of internalized dextran to that of control
cells in the absence of  xxxd2215xxx . however, in contrast to receptor-mediated endocytosis,  xxxd2215xxx  caused a dramatic decrease of dextran uptake by about 50% for control cells in all
experiments (n ⫽ 3). as a result, internalization of dextran in
the presence of  xxxd2215xxx  was about 1.5 times higher in
 xxxg9xxx -gfp expressing cells than in controls (fig. 8b).

 xxxg9xxx -mediated lipid exposure
thus, it is unlikely that  xxxg9xxx  functions as a pc transporter,
at least of the pc analogue used. we cannot preclude that
endogenous pc is transported by  xxxg9xxx . recently, it has been
suggested that  xxxg10xxx  and  xxxg12xxx  are involved in cell surface
translocation of natural pc (31). however, these transporters
have been shown to recognize nbd analogues of pc as well.
furthermore, our results do not preclude an  xxxg9xxx -mediated transport of pc upon binding of  xxxg1335xxx -i to  xxxg9xxx . this
could be caused either by switching or by broadening of the
lipid specificity of the transport activity upon  xxxg1335xxx -i binding.
an alternative hypothesis is that  xxxg9xxx  facilitates the transfer of pc from the exoplasmic leaflet to  xxxg1335xxx -i. a similar
function has been proposed for half-size abc transporters
abcg5 and abcg8. small (32) suggested that the heterodimer
abcg5-abcg8 may facilitate the exposure of membranebound cholesterol to bile salts. thus,  xxxg9xxx  might present pc
to  xxxg1335xxx -i in an atp-dependent manner. once  xxxg1335xxx -i complexes have been formed, cholesterol is taken up from the
plasma membrane by these complexes. previously, it has been
shown that the transfer of phospholipids and cholesterol from
cells to  xxxg1335xxx -i represents different pathways. although the
transfer of phospholipids was dependent upon  xxxg9xxx  and
sensitive to  xxxd2215xxx , cholesterol efflux was independent of
functional  xxxg9xxx  (30). furthermore, phospholipid transfer
preceded the binding of cholesterol to  xxxg1335xxx -i.
lipid-transporting abc transporters—taken together, our
results support the hypothesis that  xxxg9xxx  may function as a
lipid transporter specifically recognizing amino phospholipids.
other members of the  xxxg22xxx  family have been identified in mammalian cells as mediators of phospholipid outward
transport, differing in lipid specificity.  xxxg12xxx  ( xxxg12xxx ) and its
mouse homologue ( xxxg12xxx  pgp) transport pc (31, 33–37). in contrast,  xxxg10xxx  ( xxxg10xxx  pgp), giving rise to a frequent form of
pleiotropic resistance in tumor cells, transports various lipid
analogues (18, 23, 36, 38) and probably also the endogenous
lipids  xxxd2973xxx  (a short-chain pc), phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylserine, and glucosylceramide (18, 31, 39,
40) from the cytoplasmic to the exoplasmic plasma membrane
leaflet.  xxxg13xxx  (mrp1), belonging to the abcc family, was reported to mediate outward transport of c6-nbd-pc and -ps in
murine erythrocytes (41, 42) and nbd-sphingolipids in epithelial
cells (43). at the present state,  xxxg9xxx  seems to belong to a class
of abc lipid transporters of a rather high specificity, recognizing
amino phospholipids. however, to provide convincing evidence
for lipid transport activity of  xxxg9xxx  as well as for its putative
lipid specificity, functional studies on reconstituted proteoliposomes are required.  xxxg9xxx  reconstituted into giant liposomes
with a distinct lipid composition and a marginal degree of membrane curvature similar to that of a cell, avoiding the generation
of high lateral pressure that could potentially inhibit lipid transport, might resemble the system of choice to adequately address
its lipid transport activity (18, 44).
role of  xxxg9xxx  in endocytosis—recently, zha et al. (14) have
shown that receptor-mediated endocytosis is up-regulated in
homozygous tangier fibroblasts in comparison to control cells.
in addition, the authors (14) also observed enhanced receptormediated endocytosis upon  xxxd2215xxx  treatment of control fibroblasts with functional wild type  xxxg9xxx  when studying uptake of fluorescent transferrin. these results were rationalized
in the frame of a model originally developed by devaux (45, 46)
and supported by subsequent experimental studies (47– 49).
according to the model, invaginations of biological membranes
can originate from transbilayer transport of lipids, leading to a
difference of surface area between both membrane monolayers
and, because of the very low compressibility of lipid membranes, finally to bending of the membrane. for example, such

control cells at 37 °c. likewise, exofacial c6-nbd-pe originating from intracellularly metabolized c6-nbd-ps was enhanced in  xxxg9xxx -gfp expressing cells. no influence of inhibitors of  xxxg10xxx  pgp and mrp1 was observed precluding
any role of those abc transporters in exposure of amino
phospholipid analogues.
an elevated appearance of amino phospholipid analogues on
the surface of  xxxg9xxx -gfp expressing cells was also observed
at 15 °c when vesicular transport is inhibited in mdckii cells
(25). this confirms that the increased accessibility of amino
phospholipid analogues to bsa in  xxxg9xxx -gfp expressing cells
is associated with an enhanced outward redistribution of analogues in the plasma membrane. however, these data do not
preclude that  xxxg9xxx  affects both intracellular vesicle transport (to the plasma membrane) and transbilayer organization
of lipids in subcellular membranes (29) which may contribute
to/interfere with the increased exposure of amino phospholipid
analogues at the cell surface of  xxxg9xxx -gfp expressing cells at
37 °c and to differences in the temperature dependence of lipid
exposure observed between c6-nbd-pe and c6-nbd-ps.
in agreement with our results on the surface exposure of
c6-nbd-ps and consistent with a role of  xxxg9xxx  in the transport of endogenous ps, binding of apc- xxxg166xxx  to the cell
surface of  xxxg9xxx -expressing cells was significantly higher
than binding to control cells. the dependence of ps exposure on
 xxxg9xxx -gfp expression was confirmed by two independent
observations. first, the amount of exofacial c6-nbd-ps and
endogenous ps correlated with the expression of  xxxg9xxx -gfp.
with increasing number of cell passages, the level of abca1gfp expression decreased. this was accompanied by a reduction of c6-nbs-ps exposure almost to the level of control cells
and a significant decline of  xxxg166xxx  binding. second, binding
of apc- xxxg166xxx  was higher for high  xxxg9xxx -gfp expressing
cells in comparison to low  xxxg9xxx -gfp expressing cells. these
results confirm previous observations that have consistently
shown enhanced binding of  xxxg166xxx  to  xxxg9xxx -gfp expressing cells (6, 11, 14). for example, an enhanced binding of
fluorescent  xxxg166xxx  was found in nontransfected raw264.7
cells after induction of  xxxg9xxx  expression by camp analogues,
indicating an increased exposure of endogenous ps on the
exoplasmic leaflet of those cells (11).
the exposure neither of c6-nbd-ps nor of endogenous ps
was reduced in  xxxg9xxx -expressing cells upon treatment of cells
with  xxxd2215xxx .  xxxd2215xxx  has been found to inhibit abca1mediated efflux of phospholipids and cholesterol to  xxxg1335xxx -i even
at a lower concentration (100 ␮m) as used in our study (6, 11,
13, 30). however, although several studies have shown that the
level of exofacial ps is elevated in  xxxg9xxx -gfp expressing
cells, it has not been reported to our knowledge that the exposure of ps is inhibited by  xxxd2215xxx . a reasonable explanation
to this different influence of  xxxd2215xxx  on lipid transfer may be
provided by a recent study (26) that has shown that lipid
transport activity and docking properties of  xxxg9xxx  are governed by topographically distinct domains.  xxxd2215xxx  might
affect the docking side of  xxxg9xxx  and thereby the lipid efflux to
 xxxg1335xxx -i, but not its lipid transport activity.
involvement of  xxxg9xxx  in transport of pc across the plasma
membrane—precursor labeling of cells with c6-nbd-pa at
15 °c permitted us to investigate the transport of the newly
synthesized c6-nbd-pc from the cytoplasmic to the exoplasmic plasma membrane leaflet. by using the same experimental
approach, it has been shown that the  xxxg10xxx  ( xxxg10xxx  pgp)
mediates a transport from the cytoplasmic to the exoplasmic
leaflet of the c6-nbd-pc analogue (17, 20). for  xxxg9xxx -gfp
expressing cells, we did not observe an enhanced outward
redistribution of the pc analogue with respect to control cells.

a difference of surface area could be built up by the rapid and
efficient transport of amino phospholipids, in particular of
phosphatidylserine, from the exoplasmic to the cytoplasmic
leaflet of the plasma membrane of eukaryotic cells by the
amino phospholipid translocase (50). thus, this directed transport could be an essential determinant of endocytosis. indeed,
knocking out of putative lipid transporters of the plasma membrane of yeast cells leads to an inhibition of endocytosis (49).
zha et al. (14) proposed that transport of ps by  xxxg9xxx  in the
direction opposite to that of the amino phospholipid translocase
would reduce the surface area difference between monolayers
and counteract invagination of the plasma membrane.
here we have re-investigated the endocytotic activity of control and  xxxg9xxx -gfp expressing cells. following the protocol of
zha et al. (14), we also observed a significantly reduced receptor-mediated endocytosis of fluorescent transferrin in abca1gfp expressing cells in comparison with controls. moreover,
the level of endocytosis of  xxxg9xxx -gfp expressing cells increased to the level of control cells upon treatment with  xxxd2215xxx . although these data are in agreement with those of zha
et al. (14), they cannot be explained straightforward in the
frame of the model outlined above because we did not find an
inhibition of ps transport in  xxxd2215xxx -treated  xxxg9xxx -gfp
expressing cells. our data do not necessarily contradict that
such a model might be applicable to explain the influence of
 xxxg9xxx  on endocytosis. apart from its lipid transport activity,
 xxxg9xxx  might modulate endocytosis by different yet unknown
modes, at least one of them being sensitive to  xxxd2215xxx . even
in the fibroblast cell system used by zha et al. (14), it is not
known whether the increase of endocytosis in  xxxd2215xxx -treated
wild type  xxxg9xxx -gfp expressing cells is due to an inhibition of
ps outward transport. this issue has not been studied by the
authors (14) (see above also). thus, further studies are warranted to explore how  xxxg9xxx  can influence endocytosis, as
well as which  xxxg9xxx -dependent sides of the endocytotic machinery are sensitive to  xxxd2215xxx . indeed, at the present stage
it cannot be excluded that  xxxd2215xxx  affects endocytosis by
various pathways as illustrated by our results on fluid-phase
endocytosis. again in agreement with the work of zha et al.
(14), we found that the reduced fluid-phase endocytosis in
 xxxg9xxx -expressing cells increased upon treatment with  xxxd2215xxx  to the level observed for control cells in the absence of
 xxxd2215xxx . however, treatment of  xxxd2215xxx  caused a significant decrease of this endocytotic activity in control cells. unfortunately, zha et al. (14) did not report on the influence of
 xxxd2215xxx  on fluid-phase endocytosis in their cell systems. nevertheless, our results clearly show that  xxxd2215xxx  may differently affect the various endocytotic pathways of eukaryotic
cells. finally, it has to be emphasized that endocytosis phenotype and consequences of  xxxd2215xxx  treatment may depend on
the cell system used.
