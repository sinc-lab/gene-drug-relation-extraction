rhinitis, persistent allergic rhinitis

perennial allergic rhinitis affects up to 21% of the general population in some countries.1 in temperate climates
house dust mite, cockroach, mold, and animal dander are
common allergens triggering perennial allergic rhinitis
symptoms. in subtropical or tropical climates, pollen
might also trigger perennial symptoms.2,3
allergic rhinitis is characterized by inflammation of
the nasal mucosa involving activation of cd4+ t cells,
langerhan’s cells, mast cells, epithelial cells, and
endothelial cells and recruitment and activation of
eosinophils and basophils. macrophages, neutrophils, and
fibroblasts also play a role. the allergic response is characterized by the synthesis and release of th2 cytokines
and the coordinate expression of chemokines and adhesion molecules.4 the end-organ effects of nasal itching,
sneezing, rhinorrhea, and congestion, as well as itching of
the eyes, nose, and palate, occur as a result of release of
chemical mediators of inflammation, including histamine,
leukotrienes and other  xxxd208xxx  metabolites, and
kinins from activated effector cells, primarily mast cells
and basophils. histamine plays an important role in the
pathophysiology of allergic rhinitis through its neural and
vascular effects, leading to itching, sneezing, rhinorrhea,
and congestion, and also through its proinflammatory
effects, including increased expression of adhesion molecules, cytokines, and chemokines.4
h1-antihistamines are recommended as first-line treatment in perennial allergic rhinitis2,3; however, they have
not been optimally studied in this disorder. in contrast, in
seasonal allergic rhinitis the evidence base for their efficacy consists of hundreds of prospective, randomized,
placebo-controlled, double-blind, parallel-group studies.2,3,5  xxxd1846xxx , a new oral selective h1-antihistamine with anti-inflammatory and anti-allergic activities in
addition to its antihistaminic activity has a 27-hour elimination half-life, which facilitates once daily dosing. in
clinical pharmacology and seasonal allergic rhinitis studies to date, its adverse event profile has been similar to
that of placebo.6-11 we hypothesized that  xxxd1846xxx 
would be more effective than placebo in decreasing the
symptoms of perennial allergic rhinitis.

background: the evidence base for the use of h1-antihistamines in the treatment of perennial allergic rhinitis is considerably smaller than it is in the treatment of seasonal allergic
rhinitis.
objective: we hypothesized that  xxxd1846xxx , a new, nonsedating selective h1-antihistamine, would be efficacious and
safe in the treatment of perennial allergic rhinitis.
methods: in a multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled,
double-blind, parallel-group study, 676 patients with symptomatic perennial allergic rhinitis were randomly assigned to 4
weeks of treatment with either 5 mg of  xxxd1846xxx  once daily
or placebo. efficacy was assessed by using a morning-evening
instantaneous total symptom score (tss), which was composed
of scores for 4 individual nasal symptoms (rhinorrhea, itching,
sneezing, and postnasal drip) and 3 individual nonnasal symptoms (itching eyes, watering eyes, and itching of the ears or
palate). secondary outcome measures included a morningevening reflective tss, total nasal and nonnasal symptoms
scores, and individual symptom scores. safety evaluations,
including 12-lead electrocardiograms, were performed.
results: six hundred thirty-four patients completed the study.
 xxxd1846xxx  consistently diminished perennial allergic rhinitis symptoms, reducing the morning-evening instantaneous
tss (p = .005), the morning-evening reflective tss (p = .007),
the morning-evening reflective total nonnasal score (p = .023),
and the individual nasal symptom scores for rhinorrhea, nasal
itching, sneezing, and postnasal drip/drainage (p = .05 to p =
.013) during weeks 1 through 4. improvement in symptoms
was observed after the first dose. dropouts, and the type and
frequency of adverse events (headache, viral infection, pharyngitis, and upper respiratory tract infection), were similar in
both treatment groups. no clinically significant changes in
qtc intervals were observed.
conclusions:  xxxd1846xxx  rapidly and safely reduced the

methods
study design
this randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, parallelgroup study was approved by the institutional review board of each
participating center. all patients provided written informed consent
before study entry. during the screening evaluation, which was conducted 4 to 14 days before randomization, inclusion and exclusion
criteria were assessed, medical history was obtained, physical
examination was conducted, and severity of allergic rhinitis was
determined. a 12-lead electrocardiogram and laboratory tests
(hematology and blood chemistry tests and urinalysis) were performed. after screening, participants were assigned to 4 weeks of
treatment with 5 mg of  xxxd1846xxx  once daily or placebo by using
a computer-generated randomization schedule. study visits were
conducted at screening, baseline (day 1), and days 8, 15, and 29.

inclusion and exclusion criteria

food and drug
reactions and
anaphylaxis

patients were considered for study inclusion if they were 12 years
of age or older, had a history of moderate perennial allergic rhinitis
symptoms of at least 2 years’ duration, and had a positive skin test
response to 1 or more allergens (house dust mite, cockroach, mold,
and animal dander) within the previous 12 months. at the screening
visit, they were required to have perennial allergic rhinitis symptoms
with a 12-hour reflective total symptom score (tss), including nasal
stuffiness-congestion, of at least 10 (maximum score, 24) and no
greater than moderate nasal stuffiness/congestion (see efficacy evaluations). the summed reflective score for congestion during the 3
days before baseline was required to be no greater than 12, and the
summed tss was required to be at least 60 (see efficacy evaluations). the overall rhinitis score at baseline was required to be
greater than 2 (on the basis of a 4-point scale), indicating moderateto-severe disease.
patients were required to be in good general health, as confirmed
by history, physical examination, hematology and blood chemistry
tests, and urinalysis. women of childbearing potential were required
to have a negative serum pregnancy test at screening and to use a
medically accepted method of contraception before screening and
during the study.
exclusion criteria included: seasonal allergic rhinitis triggered
by an allergen pollinating during the time of the study, structural
abnormalities interfering with nasal airflow, an upper respiratory
tract or sinus infection requiring antibiotic treatment within 14 days
before screening, a viral upper respiratory tract infection during the
7 days before screening, and current or past history of recurrent or
chronic sinusitis, chronic purulent postnasal drip, rhinitis medicamentosa, or asthma that necessitated the regular use of inhaled corticosteroids or use of systemic corticosteroids. also excluded were
patients with a history of adverse reactions to more than 2 classes of
medications or those with a history of adverse effects to antihistamines. patients who had used any investigational drug in the 30

days before screening, as well as those judged to be dependent on
decongestants (nasal, oral, or ocular), intranasal h1-antihistamines,
or intranasal corticosteroids, were also excluded in the interest of
safety. medications prohibited during the study included  xxxd1763xxx ,
nedocromil, corticosteroids (other than low- or moderate-potency
dermatologic preparations), h1-antihistamines other than  xxxd1846xxx  (including topical ketotifen or  xxxd2469xxx ), leukotriene modifiers, intranasal ipratropium bromide, ocular or intranasal saline, or
systemic antibiotics. pseudoephedrine was permitted on an as-needed basis for use as a a rescue medication for relief of severe congestion. appropriate washout times were required for previous use
of prohibited medications.
patients receiving allergen immunotherapy were excluded unless
they were on a regular maintenance schedule before screening and
could maintain this schedule for the duration of the study; however,
desensitization treatment within 24 hours before a study visit was
prohibited. pregnant or nursing women were also excluded.

study medications
the 5-mg  xxxd1846xxx  were identical in appearance to
the placebo tablets and were packaged identically. all study personnel were blinded to the identity of the tablets, which were distributed in sealed and coded bottles. participants were instructed to
take each dose of study medication in the morning at approximately the same time each day. compliance was assessed on the basis of
diary card review, direct questioning, and tablet counts. as noted
previously, participants were permitted to take pseudoephedrine for
treatment of severe nasal congestion, and nasal congestion was
therefore excluded from the primary tss efficacy analyses.

efficacy evaluations
allergic rhinitis severity was assessed by using symptom scores
recorded on daily diary cards. symptoms of perennial allergic rhinitis (ie, rhinorrhea, nasal itching, sneezing, postnasal drip/drainage,
itchy/burning eyes, tearing/watering eyes, and itching of ears or
palate) were individually assessed by using a 4-point scale (0 =
none to 3 = severe, table i). the tss was the sum of the 4 nasal
symptoms (rhinorrhea, nasal itching, sneezing, and postnasal
drip/drainage) and 3 nonnasal symptoms (itchy/burning eyes, tearing/watering eyes, and itching of the ears or palate). congestion,
although an important inclusion criterion and a symptom that was
scored during this study, was not included in the tss because
patients could use pseudoephedrine as needed. participants, their
parents or guardians, or both scored the severity of perennial allergic rhinitis symptoms twice daily on the basis of how they felt during the previous 12 hours (reflective) and how they felt at the time
of assessment (instantaneous). the symptoms were scored and
recorded on awakening (predose) and approximately 12 hours later.
the morning instantaneous evaluations provided an assessment of
the duration of the treatment.
the overall severity of allergic rhinitis was assessed jointly by
investigators and participants at baseline and at subsequent visits by
using a 4-point scale (0 = none to 3 = severe). the overall response
to study medication was also assessed jointly by the investigators
and participants at each postbaseline visit by using a 5-point scale
(1 = complete relief to 5 = treatment failure).

efficacy variables
the primary efficacy outcome was the 4-week average morningevening instantaneous tss expressed as a change from baseline.
secondary outcomes included morning-evening reflective tss,
total nasal symptom score, total nonnasal symptom score, and each
of the 7 individual symptom scores. overall condition and therapeutic response were measured at each study visit and were
expressed as change from baseline and as raw scores. all efficacy
analyses were performed by using the intent-to-treat data.

safety evaluations
vital signs and adverse events were assessed at each study visit.
all adverse events were graded according to severity and the potential relationship to study medication. blood chemistry and hematology tests, urinalysis, and 12-lead electrocardiograms with reporting
of ventricular rate and pr, qrs, qt and qtc intervals were performed at screening and at the end of the study.

the sample size of 300 participants per treatment group was
chosen to detect, with 90% power and at a 5% significance level, a
difference between  xxxd1846xxx  and placebo of 1.3 units or more
in the mean tss expressed as a change from baseline, assuming a
pooled sd of 5.0. all randomized participants who had at least 1
postrandomization evaluation were included in the data analysis.
the primary variable, the 4-week average morning-evening instantaneous tss expressed as a change from baseline, was analyzed by
using a 2-way anova model that extracted sources of variation
caused by treatment and center. the secondary variables expressed
as a change from baseline were analyzed for the average over the 4week treatment period, the first 4 days of treatment, and the average
over each of weeks 1 through 4. all secondary variables were analyzed by using a 2-way anova model that extracted sources of
variation caused by treatment and center.

results
dropouts and baseline demographics
a total of 676 participants were randomized to treatment
at 33 centers: 337 to  xxxd1846xxx  and 339 to placebo.
twenty (5.93%) participants randomized to  xxxd1846xxx 
and 22 (6.48%) randomized to placebo did not complete
the study. the reasons for early discontinuation were similar between the groups. discontinuations as a result of lack
of efficacy occurred in 6% and 7% of patients in the  xxxd1846xxx  and placebo groups, respectively. discontinuations
as a result of adverse events occurred in 3.3% and 2.1% of
patients in the  xxxd1846xxx  and placebo groups, respectively. in the  xxxd1846xxx  group these events included
sinusitis, asthma, upper respiratory tract infection, nausea,
headache, gingivitis, and fracture. in the placebo group
they included sinusitis, cough, upper respiratory tract infection, dizziness/asthenia, and benign palate cyst.
the groups had similar baseline characteristics (table
ii). the majority of participants were white, and more
women than men were enrolled. at baseline, the mean
morning-evening instantaneous tss did not differ in the
 xxxd1846xxx  (10.70) and placebo groups (10.64).

efficacy
during days 1 through 29,  xxxd1846xxx  was significantly more effective than placebo for reducing the

morning-evening instantaneous tss, with mean reductions from baseline of 35.0% with  xxxd1846xxx  and
27.4% with placebo (p = .005, fig 1). a significant difference (p = .001) between groups was noted after the
first dose at the first time point for which complete 24hour data were available (day 2), and this difference persisted for the duration of the study. a supplemental
analysis of instantaneous tss that included nasal congestion provided similar results to those reported for the
primary outcome (tss minus nasal congestion). at days
1 through 29, there was a significant improvement from
baseline values in mean instantaneous tsss compared
with placebo (p = .006); mean percentage reductions
from baseline were 30.8% and 23.8% for the  xxxd1846xxx  and placebo groups, respectively.  xxxd1846xxx  was
more effective than placebo as early as day 1 and continued throughout the treatment period.
the mean change from baseline in morning-evening
reflective tss over days 1 through 29 was significantly
greater in the  xxxd1846xxx  group than in the placebo
group (–37.9% vs –32.3%, respectively; p = .007).
 xxxd1846xxx  was significantly more effective than
placebo in reducing mean morning-evening reflective
tsss at most time points (p ≤ .018).
 xxxd1846xxx  was associated with significantly greater
improvements in both instantaneous and reflective (p ≤
.005, fig 2) total nasal symptom scores during days 1
through 29. mean percentage reductions in morningevening reflective total nonnasal symptom scores during
days 1 through 29 were significantly greater with  xxxd1846xxx  than with placebo (p = .023, data not shown).
statistically significant improvements from baseline in
mean morning-evening instantaneous individual symptom scores (fig 3) compared with placebo were observed
for rhinorrhea, nasal itching, sneezing, and postnasal
drip/drainage, but not for nasal congestion, at the primary time point (days 1-29). the results of the mean morning-evening reflective, morning instantaneous, morning
reflective, evening instantaneous, and evening reflective
individual symptom score analyses were similar to those
of the morning-evening instantaneous analysis.

discussion

food and drug
reactions and
anaphylaxis

in the present study, which was conducted in adolescents and adults, we have demonstrated that once daily
administration of  xxxd1846xxx  relieved the symptoms of
rhinorrhea, nasal itching, sneezing, and postnasal dripdrainage significantly in patients with perennial allergic
rhinitis, thus adding to the small body of evidence currently supporting the use of h1-antihistamines in this disorder. the major limitation in this study was our patients’
unrestricted use of pseudoephedrine for rescue treatment
of nasal congestion, and this is likely reflected in the lack
of a statistically significant difference in the individual
symptom scores for congestion.
 xxxd1846xxx  treatment was associated with significant reductions in the tss, as well as in the total nasal
and nonnasal symptom scores. it had a rapid onset of
action, providing significant relief after the first dose.
efficacy was maintained throughout the 24-hour dosing
interval and did not wane during 4 weeks of treatment.
 xxxd1846xxx  was well tolerated, with no evidence of
sedation or cardiac toxicity. the results of this study in
patients with perennial allergic rhinitis are consistent
with the results of previous studies of  xxxd1846xxx  in
patients with seasonal allergic rhinitis, in which it provided rapid and sustained relief of rhinitis symptoms and
was well tolerated.9-11
in contrast to the large numbers of studies on seasonal allergic rhinitis, there are very few published
studies of the efficacy and safety of h1-antihistamines
in perennial allergic rhinitis. in randomized, doubleblind, placebo-controlled trials, azelastine, 12 cetirizine, 13-15 ebastine, 14,16,17 fexofenadine, 18 loratadine,19-21 and mizolastine21,22 have been reported to
improve perennial allergic rhinitis symptoms; however,
of these medications, only cetirizine and  xxxd1846xxx 
are approved for the treatment of perennial allergic
rhinitis in the united states.
in the future, controlled clinical trials in which  xxxd1846xxx  is directly compared with other h1-antihistamines will further define its place in perennial allergic
rhinitis management. in the present study, as in virtually
all previous clinical trials in patients with either seasonal
or perennial allergic rhinitis, traditional subjective
assessments of rhinitis symptoms were used to evaluate
the efficacy of the interventions. in subsequent studies,
objective measurements should be incorporated wherever possible; for example, nasal peak inspiratory flow,
which is easily performed and correlates with subjective
assessment of nasal congestion,23 has, to date, been
underused in large clinical trials.
in summary,  xxxd1846xxx  is effective and safe in the
treatment of perennial allergic rhinitis. it rapidly reduces
nasal and nonnasal symptoms, and its effects do not
diminish during 4 weeks of treatment.
we gratefully acknowledge the assistance of all of the physicians
in the  xxxd1846xxx  study group.
