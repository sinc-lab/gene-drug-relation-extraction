abstract—voltage-activated ca21 channels exist as multigene families that share common structural features.
different ca21 channels are distinguished by their electrophysiology and pharmacology and can be classified as
either low or high voltage–activated channels. six a1 subunit genes cloned previously code for high
voltage–activated ca21 channels; therefore, we have used a database search strategy to identify new ca21 channel
genes, possibly including low voltage–activated (t-type) channels. a novel expressed sequence–tagged cdna
clone of a1g was used to screen a cdna library, and in the present study, we report the cloning of a1h (or
cavt.2), a low voltage–activated ca21 channel from human heart. northern blots of human mrna detected more
a1h expression in peripheral tissues, such as kidney and heart, than in brain. we mapped the gene,  xxxg308xxx ,
to human chromosome 16p13.3 and mouse chromosome 17. expression of a1h in hek-293 cells resulted in ca21
channel currents displaying voltage dependence, kinetics, and unitary conductance characteristic of native t-type
ca21 channels. the a1h channel is sensitive to  xxxd2638xxx , a nondihydropyridine ca21 channel blocker, with an
ic50 of 1.4 mmol/l, consistent with the reported potency of  xxxd2638xxx  for t-type ca21 channels. together with
a1g, a rat brain t-type ca21 channel also cloned in our laboratory, these genes define a unique family of
ca21 channels. (circ res. 1998;83:103-109.)

olecular cloning has revealed that the main poreforming (a1) subunits of voltage-gated ion channels
are encoded by a large family of related genes. the a1
subunit consists of 4 homologous repeats (i to iv), each
having 6 transmembrane segments (s1 to s6) containing a
highly conserved pore loop and a distinctive voltage sensor
(s4). hva ca21 channels can be classified by their pharmacological properties into l, n, p, q, and r types. previously,
6 ca21 channel a1 subunit genes have been isolated (a1s,
a1c, a1d, a1a, a1b, and a1e), and all of these code for
hva channels.1
lva t-type ca21 channels were first discovered in the mid
1980s in cells isolated from dorsal root ganglion,2–5 in cardiac
myocytes,6,7 and in pituitary gh3 cells.8 in contrast to the
hva class, t-type channels have a distinctive voltage dependence, fast inactivation resulting in “transient” currents,
and a small (tiny) single-channel conductance with ba21 as
the charge carrier.6 t-type ca21 channels are also relatively
resistant to agents that block hva channels.
t-type ca21 channels in the cardiovascular system may
function in pacemaker activity,9,10 and abnormal expression of
t-type channels has been observed in some animal models of
hypertrophy11 and hypertension.12 the widely used therapeu-

tic ca21 channel antagonists, such as diltiazem, verapamil,
and nifedipine, are l-type channel blockers; these drugs are
used extensively to treat hypertension and angina.13 l-type
channels are widespread in the cardiovascular system, in
cardiac myocytes, and in coronary smooth muscle. in the
normal heart, t-type ca21 channels are more restricted to
conduction tissues, such as atrial pacemaker cells and purkinje fibers, but are also found in coronary smooth muscle.14 –16 recently, a new class of nondihydropyridine ca21
channel antagonists has been developed; they are structurally
and functionally different from l-type channel blockers, with
unique actions likely due to relative selectivity for t-type
channels.  xxxd2638xxx  (hoffman-la roche, inc) is the first of
these drugs currently used as an alternative medication for
hypertension and angina pectoris.
we have cloned a novel ca21 channel from human heart,
a1h. when expressed in hek-293 cells, the a1h cdna
results in currents characteristic of native t-type channels.
a1h is the second member identified of a new family of
t-type ca21 channels. finally, we demonstrated that the a1h
channel is sensitive to  xxxd2638xxx , with an ic50 of 1.4 mmol/l,
in agreement with the relative selectivity of this drug for
t-type ca21 channels reported previously.17–19

materials and methods
genetic databases were searched using a text-based strategy, specifically looking for sequences similar to ca21 channels. expressed
sequence-tagged clones were obtained from genome systems, inc.
for probes, cdna clones were radioactively labeled using the
radprime kit (gibco-brl) and [a-32p]dctp from amersham. a
human heart cdna library in lgt10 was screened by conventional
filter hybridization according to the manufacturer’s protocol (clontech). the a1h coding sequence was assembled in the ecori-kpni
sites of the vector psp72 (promega) by standard methods as follows:
cdna clone hhd1 (ecori [274] to bamhi [725]) was ligated with
clone hh4 (bamhi [725] to bspei [2627]), clone hh12-1 (bspei
[2627] to sali [4621]), and hh22-1 (sali [4624] to kpni [7461]). the
a1h cdna was sequenced on both strands using oligonucleotide
primers and sequenase v. 2.0 (amersham). sequence data acquisition, comparison, and alignments were performed using a digitizer
and dnasis for windows software (hitachi).
the human chromosomal location of the  xxxg308xxx  gene was
determined using the genbridge 4 radiation hybrid panel and a pcr
assay (forward primer, 59-tcgtgcgcaaagtatctgtg-39; reverse primer, 59-tgccggccccataggtctc-39). fluorescent in
situ hybridization of the  xxxg308xxx  cdna clone  xxxg666xxx -2 (4734 to
7758) to 20 normal male human metaphase spreads was carried out
as described previously.20,21 the mouse chromosomal location of
 xxxg308xxx  was determined using the eucib backcross panel.22 a
pcr assay based on the sequence of genbank no. w76774 (genbank no. af051947) (forward primer, 59-agatggatgccgagatcgag-39; reverse primer, 59-cacagatactttgcgcacga-39) and a mus spretus–specific mspi polymorphism were
used.
a human multiple-tissue northern blot was obtained from clontech and hybridized at 42°c for 16 to 20 hours in a solution
containing 50% formamide according to the manufacturer’s protocol. an a1h cdna probe (nucleotides 3962 to 5664) was added at
a concentration of 23106 cpm/ml. the blot was washed up to 60°c
in a final buffer of 0.13 ssc (15 mmol/l nacl and 1.5 mmol/l
sodium citrate) plus 0.1% sds.
for expression in mammalian cells, the a1h sequence (274 to
7461) was cloned into the ecorv-xbai sites of the transfection
vector pcdna3 (invitrogen), resulting in a1h-tx. hek-293 cells
(13105 per 35-mm dish) were transfected using the calphos maximizer kit (clontech) with 2 mg of a1h-tx plasmid, with the addition
of 1 mg phook-2 (invitrogen) in some cases. transiently transfected
cells were selected for expression of phook by adherence of
capture-tec beads (invitrogen) before electrophysiological experiments. for comparison, we used a hek-293 stable cell line transfected with a1c,23 a2,24 and b2a.25 each subunit was transfected and
selected separately using the resistance markers for neomycin (a1c),
hygromycin (a2), and zeomycin (b2a) (invitrogen).
whole-cell recording was performed, with ba21 used as the charge
carrier, by the ruptured-patch method in a solution containing
(mmol/l) bacl2 10, tea-cl 140, cscl 6, and hepes 10 (ph 7.4
adjusted with tea-oh). the internal pipette solution contained
(mmol/l) cscl 55, csso4 75, mgcl2 10, egta 0.1, and hepes 10
(ph adjusted to 7.2 with csoh). currents were recorded using an
axopatch 200a amplifier, a digidata 1200 a/d converter, and
pclamp software (axon instruments, inc). data were digitized at 2
khz and filtered at 1 khz. pipettes were pulled from tw-150-6
capillary tubing (world precision instruments) and fire-polished. tip
resistance was between 1.7 and 3 mv. current amplitudes and
exponential fits (chebyshev method) were calculated using clampfit
software (axon instruments, inc). prism software (graphpad) was

used to fit data with either boltzmann or sigmoidal dose-response
equations. pooled data are expressed as mean6sem.
for single-channel analysis, hek-293 cells were cotransfected
with a1h-tx and a plasmid coding for gfp (green fluorescent
protein, “ps65t,” a gift from t. mcclintock, university of kentucky, lexington). fluorescent cells were patch-clamped in the
cell-attached configuration. in a separate series of experiments, we
confirmed that all cells with green fluorescence also expressed a1h
using the whole-cell recording mode. single channels were measured
with standard depolarizing bath solution containing (mmol/l) kcl
140, egta 10, mgcl2 1, cacl2 1, dextrose 10, and hepes 10 (ph
7.4), and the pipette solution contained (mmol/l) bacl2 115, egta
1, and hepes 10 (ph 7.4). the data were low pass–filtered at 2 khz
and digitized  xxxd1891xxx  khz under control of pclamp6 acquisition
software (axon instruments). for off-line analysis, data were digitally filtered at 1 khz. data analysis was performed with the chanal
program (webfoot software, courtesy of d. piper, university of
utah, salt lake city). single-channel amplitudes were estimated
with the variance-mean technique to allow for discrimination of
small amplitude events.26

results
in an effort to find potential t-type ca21 channel sequences
that escaped previous detection by homology-based screening
methods, we searched the genbank databases for sequences
similar to cloned ca21 channels and identified multiple cdna
clones that were unique. one partial expressed sequence–
tagged cdna sequence from clone h06096 was similar to the
first membrane-spanning region (s1) of domain iii of the
carp a1s (genbank no. p22316). we determined the full
sequence of h06096 (genbank no. af029228) and found
that it contained a putative voltage sensor and pore loop
characteristic of voltage-activated ion channels and then used
it as a probe to screen a human heart cdna library.
successive rounds of screening resulted in 4 overlapping
cdnas encoding the full-length sequence of a1h, or cavt.2
(genbank accession no. af051946).
this cdna predicts a protein of 2042 amino acids with the
overall structure of a voltage-gated ca21 channel. searching
the nonredundant genbank database sequences showed highest homology of a1h with a protein predicted from the
genomic dna of the nematode caenorhabditis elegans,
c54d2.5 (genbank no. u37548). additional database sequences of mouse and human origin were homologous with
a1h and are likely to be members of the same class of ca21
channels.
figure 1 shows an alignment of a1h versus a1g, a t-type
ca21 channel from rat brain also isolated in our laboratory.27
both sequences predict a 4-domain structure with conserved
pore loops (p loop) and voltage sensors (s4), which are
defining features of voltage-gated ion channels. it is interesting that in domains iii and iv of both novel channels, the
negatively charged glutamates involved in ca21 selectivity,28
which are invariant in all the hva ca21 channels, are
replaced by aspartates. the amino acid sequence of a1h has
an overall sequence identity of 57% with a1g; allowing for
conservative substitutions with respect to structure shows that
these proteins are 70% similar. much higher sequence identity (average, 90%) is found in the putative transmembrane
segments. the amino and carboxyl termini and the cytoplasmic interdomain loops are most divergent, although some
small stretches of homology exist. the lack of an identifiable

membrane-spanning regions, as marked in figure 1, were compared for all the cloned ca21 channel types. the genbank
accession numbers of sequences compared are as follows:
a1s, m23919; a1c, l04569; a1d, m76558; a1a, x99897; a1b,

motif for binding of the b subunits29 suggests that these
channels do not interact with the same b subunits that are
important for hva channel function.30 ca21 binding domains
that play a role in ca21-dependent inactivation31 are also
absent. careful comparison of the expressed properties of
a1h with other ca21 channels is needed to explore the
functional relevance of these sequence differences.
the homology analysis shown in figure 2 demonstrates
that the hva channels (grouped into l-type versus non–ltype) are separated from a less homologous class of channels
that contains a1g and a1h. the high level of divergence
between the hva and lva classes of ca21 channels explains
why previous screening techniques based on homology failed
to reveal these novel genes.
the human  xxxg308xxx  locus, corresponding to a1h, was
assigned to chromosome 16 between the markers wi-7742
and wi-3061 with a lod (logarithm for the likelihood of
linkage) score of .3. a chromosomal band location of
16p13.3 was assigned by fluorescent in situ hybridization
analysis. the mouse  xxxg308xxx  locus was mapped to mouse
chromosome 17 between the markers d17mit55 and
d17mit100, at a distance of 7.5 cm from the centromere with
a lod score of 8.0. this is a previously defined conserved
linkage group.32 no mouse or human phenotypes have been
mapped to these chromosomal regions so far. these data
confirm the separate identity of a1h and a1g, since
 xxxg307xxx  (corresponding to the a1g cdna) was mapped to
human chromosome 17q22 and mouse chromosome 11.27
figure 3 shows a northern blot of human tissues using
sequences from domains iii and iv of a1h (nucleotides 3962
to 5664) as a probe. the high abundance of the a1h transcript
(7.9 kb) in kidney was consistent on multiple independent
blots (not shown) and may reflect a role for this t-type
channel in kidney that warrants further study. another consistent finding is the relatively higher abundance of a1h in
heart over brain. when probes derived from a1g were used
on the same or comparable blots, the ratio of signal in brain
versus heart was higher,27 indicating that a1g and a1h are
enriched in their respective source tissues.

multiple-tissue northern blot was probed with a1h (nucleotides
3962 to 5664) and exposed for 23 days. molecular weight markers are indicated on the right in kilobases.

we tested for functional expression of the a1h cdna by
transfecting the full-length coding sequence into hek-293
cells. figure 4 shows representative whole-cell current traces
elicited by depolarizing pulses in 10 mmol/l ba21 for a1h
(panel a) compared with a hek-293 cell stably transfected
with a1c from rabbit heart (panel b). corresponding currentvoltage relationships are compared in figure 4c, displaying
an activation threshold around 260 mv for a1h compared
with 230 mv for a1c. these data were transformed into
conductance and then fit with the boltzmann equation to
calculate the midpoint of activation (v0.5) of 24460.3 mv
with a slope factor (k) of 7.260.3 (n59) for a1h (figure 4d)
compared with v0.5 of 2361.5 mv with a k value of 6.661.4
(n56) for a1c. inactivation of the a1h channel was measured after 5-second prepulses to approximate steady-state
conditions, occurring at subthreshold potentials
(v0.55275.360.3, k527.860.3, n58).
kinetic analysis of a1h currents is shown in figure 5.
inward ba21 currents activated slowly near threshold potentials, whereas stronger depolarizations produced a current that
activated and inactivated quickly (figure 5a and 5b). these
kinetics are defining features of t-type channels.19 another
characteristic of t-type ca21 channels is their slow deactivation (tail current) after a test pulse.8 the time and voltage
dependence of deactivation is illustrated in figure 5c and 5d.
the voltage dependence of tail deactivation follows that
previously demonstrated for native t-type tail currents.8
t-type ca21 channels are defined by a small (,9 ps)
unitary conductance in ba21 solutions.2,6 we exploited the
slow tail current kinetics to measure unitary events under
conditions of greater driving force (figure 6a). the main
conductance level of a1h was 5.360.3 ps (n55) in
115 mmol/l external ba21 (figure 6c). this value is in the
range of previous reports of t-type channels in native
preparations. opening and closing to subconductance levels
were also observed. for repolarization potentials negative to
240 mv, most single-channel events occurred within the
initial 10 milliseconds after repolarization. however, an
exceptionally long opening is shown for 280 mv. this
occurred only once in 200 sweeps but is useful for illustrating
single-channel amplitude. the ensemble averages (figure
6b) were fit with a single exponential. similar to whole-cell
macroscopic current, the time constant for decay was more

since  xxxd2638xxx  has previously been reported to be selective for t-type ca21 channels,17,18 we tested  xxxd2638xxx  block
of a1h channels in transfected hek-293 cells. figure 7a
shows that 1 mmol/l  xxxd2638xxx  caused '50% block of the
a1h currents; the dose-response curve shown in figure 7b
resulted in an ic50 of 1.4 mmol/l.

al008716).33 we refer to this gene as  xxxg309xxx  and its
putative product as a1i.34 two of the 3 family members
identified so far, a1g and a1h, have been demonstrated to be
t-type ca21 channels on the basis of their expression in
heterologous systems.27 we include a1i as a member of this
family on the basis of its sequence similarity with a1g and
a1h ('80% for the membrane-spanning portions); however,
its properties can only be established by measuring its
expression.
the genes encoding a1g and a1h are localized on
different chromosomes, and each has a unique pattern of
tissue distribution. both a1g and a1h are expressed in heart
and brain, and northern blots reveal that their relative levels
differ between the 2 tissues. the significance of the multiple
genes with respect to tissue or cell type is not yet known. for
example, previous electrophysiological measurements from
normal cardiac cells have localized t-type currents to pacemaker cells,9,10 and additional studies are needed to determine
which gene(s) mediates those currents. also, the high abundance of a1h in kidney was not seen for a1g, perhaps
indicating a functional difference for these 2 channels.
 xxxd2638xxx  has previously been shown to be a selective
blocker of t-type ca21 channels.17,18 we obtained an ic50 of
1.4 mmol/l, which is in the range of previous reported values
(ranging from 100 nmol/l in vascular smooth muscle to
2.7 mmol/l in neuroblastoma cells).17,18 l-type channels
under similar conditions are roughly 10-fold less sensitive to
 xxxd2638xxx . although differences in reported sensitivities to
 xxxd2638xxx  and other blockers could depend on the conditions
used, we suggest that some of the variability may arise from
the expression of different members of the t-type ca21
channel gene family. we are now in a position to test this
hypothesis with the recombinant t-type ca21 channels.
the identification of multiple genes encoding t-type ca21
channels is a significant advance in the study of voltage-gated
ion channels. the availability of recombinant t-type channels
makes it possible to study t-type currents without interference from contaminating l-type currents often present in cell
preparations. this will lead to a better understanding of their
pharmacological and biophysical properties. these genes will
also provide a tool for exploring the underlying molecular
