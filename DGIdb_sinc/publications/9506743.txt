abstract
the presence of functional nongenomic progesterone (p) receptors
in human spermatozoa has been investigated by equilibrium binding
studies in intact spermatozoa, ligand blot and western blot analysis
of sperm lysates, as well as determination of the effects of the steroid
on sperm intracellular ca21 concentrations. binding experiments
were performed using progesterone-11a-glucuronide-[125i]iodotyramine as tracer. computer analysis of competition curves using different steroids as competitors indicated the presence of two distinct
binding sites for p. the high affinity site (kd in the nanomolar range)
appears to be specific for p, whereas the low affinity one (kd in the
micromolar range) binds with equal affinity 11b- xxxd2303xxx  (11bohp) and 17a- xxxd2303xxx  (17aohp). a significant
correlation exists among affinity constants (as determined by binding
studies) and ec50 values for the effects of p, 11bohp, and 17aohp
on intracellular ca21 in fura-2-loaded spermatozoa, strongly indicating the involvement of p-binding sites in the biological effect of the
steroid. in particular, dose-response curves for p were biphasic, with

an ec50 in the nanomolar range and another in the micromolar range.
conversely, curves for 11bohp and 17aohp were monophasic, with
an ec50 just in the micromolar range. ligand blot analysis of sperm
total lysates performed with peroxidase-conjugated p revealed the
presence of two binding proteins of 54 and 57 kda that were specific
for p. indeed, peroxidase-conjugated p binding was blocked by the
simultaneous presence of the unconjugated steroid. using ac262 antibody, which is directed against the p-binding domain of genomic
receptor, we detected two proteins of similar molecular mass (54 and
57 kda), whereas using antibodies directed against the dna-binding
and n-terminal domains of the genomic p receptors, the two proteins
were not detected. in addition, p54 and p57 appear to be mostly
localized in sperm membranes and virtually absent in the cytoplasm.
the involvement of these proteins in the biological effects of p is
indicated by the strong inhibitory effect of ac262 on p-induced acrosome reaction of capacitated human spermatozoa. (j clin endocrinol
metab 83: 877– 885, 1998)

a

crosome reaction (ar) is an essential event of the
process of fertilization. in mammals, physiological
ar occurs after interaction with the zona pellucida, the glycoprotein coat overlying the egg plasma membrane (1), and
is mediated by specific sperm receptor (2). during the process of fertilization, ar can also be induced by progesterone
(p), which is present in high concentrations in the cumulus
matrix that surrounds the oocyte and in the follicular fluid
(3, 4). in particular, in human spermatozoa, p induces a rapid
influx of calcium, calcium-dependent phosphoinositide hydrolysis, an increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of sperm
proteins, and chloride efflux, ultimately leading to stimulation of ar (for review, see ref. 5). in addition, in vitro studies
on mouse spermatozoa suggest that p exerts a priming effect
on zona pellucida 3-induced ar (6). the effects of p are
believed to be exerted by a nongenomic pathway (5), as also
recently described for other steroids in different cell types
(for review, see ref. 7). a steroid effect is defined as nongenomic when it occurs between a few seconds and 1–2 min

after its application and does not involve transcriptional
processes. the possible involvement of a g-aminobutyric
acida (gabaa) receptor/cl2 channel complex in the effects
of p has been suggested (for review, see ref. 8), leading to the
hypothesis of the existence of at least two different receptors
for p, one mediating the influx of calcium and the other
mediating the efflux of chloride (9). however, although data
obtained in mice (10) suggest that the gabaa receptor/cl2
channel complex can account for both p-induced chloride
and calcium fluxes, results obtained in human spermatozoa
seem to exclude the involvement of gabaa receptor/cl2
channel complex involvement in the increase in intracellular
ca21 ([ca21]i) caused by p (11–13), with the exception of a
recent report (14).
several findings suggest that the putative receptor(s) for p
in spermatozoa is located on the membrane surface. bsaconjugated p, which is unable to cross the plasma membrane,
produces the same effects as p (15, 16). moreover, immunohistochemical studies using fluorescein isothiocyanate
(fitc)-labeled bsa-conjugated p (17, 18), peroxidase-conjugated p (13), and an antibody directed against the c-terminal
domain of the genomic p receptor (19) localize p-binding
sites on human sperm heads. further, sperm p-binding sites
are sensitive to treatment with trypsin and aggregate after
binding with the agonist (20), suggesting similarities with
other surface receptors. despite all of these studies showing
p binding to the surface of ejaculated spermatozoa, the mo-

lecular, pharmacological, and kinetic characteristics of this
putative receptor(s) have not been clearly elucidated. possible candidates as sperm p receptors include a 94- to 97-kda
protein that is tyrosine phosphorylated upon stimulation
with the steroid (21–24) and gabaa receptor-like/cl channels with apparent masses of 50 and 75 kda (reviewed in ref.
8). using an antibody directed against the c-terminal binding domain of the p genomic receptor, sauber et al. (19)
recently identified a sperm protein with an apparent mass of
50 –52 kda as a possible nongenomic sperm p receptor.
in the present study, we used different approaches to
identify and characterize nongenomic p receptors on human
sperm surface. by using progesterone-11a-glucuronide[125i]iodotyramine as the labeled ligand, we identified two
distinct p-binding sites on human sperm plasma membrane.
by ligand and western blot analysis we initiated the molecular characterization of p-binding proteins. we identified
two proteins of 54 and 57 kda molecular mass that specifically bind p. in addition, we reexamined the possible involvement of gaba receptors in the effect of p by evaluating
the ability of this agonist to displace p binding as well as its
effects on sperm [ca21]i.

preparation of spermatozoa
human semen was collected, according to the who recommended
procedure (25), by masturbation from normozoospermic men undergoing semen analysis for couple infertility. samples with a linear progressive motility of less than 50% and with leukocytes and/or immature
germ cell concentration greater than 106/ml were not included in the
study. semen samples were processed as previously described (11).
briefly, spermatozoa were separated on 40% and 80% percoll gradients,
combined, washed in htf medium containing 0.3% fatty acid-free bsa,
and finally resuspended in the same medium at the indicated concentration. spermatozoa were capacitated for 2 h or otherwise indicated in
0.3% bsa-containing htf.

equilibrium binding studies
binding studies were performed on human intact spermatozoa. after
2 h of capacitation, spermatozoa were washed in phosphate-buffered
saline (pbs) and resuspended in 0.3% bsa-pbs. one hundred-microliter
aliquots of spermatozoa (8 3 107/ml) were incubated for 1 h at 4 c with
77 pmol/l progesterone-11a-glucuronide-[125i]iodotyramine in 0.3%
bsa-pbs in the presence of increasing concentrations (1e-11 to 1e-3
mol/l) of unlabeled compounds: p, 17a- xxxd2303xxx 
(17aohp), 11b- xxxd2303xxx  (11bohp), ru486, gaba, dihydrotestosterone (dht), and  xxxd2754xxx  (sigma). after incubation, 1 ml
iced tris (50 mmol/l) was added to each tube. samples were centrifuged

vol 83 • no 3

at 3000 rpm for 10 min at 4 c, and radioactivity associated with the
obtained pellets was measured in a g-counter at 70% efficiency. in some
experiments, pellets were resuspended in 1 ml glycine acid buffer (ph
2), incubated for 10 min on ice, and then centrifuged, and the obtained
pellets and supernatants were counted in a g-counter to determine the
loss of radioactivity after the acid wash.

measurement of [ca21]i
spermatozoa, prepared as described above, were loaded with 2
mmol/l fura-2/am for 45 min at 37 c, washed, and resuspended in fm
medium (125 mmol/l nacl, 10 mmol/l kcl, 2.5 mmol/l cacl2, 0.25
mmol/l mgcl2, 19 mmol/l sodium lactate, 2.5 mmol/l sodium pyruvate, 2 mmol/l hepes, and 0.3% bsa, ph 7.5), and [ca21]i before and
after stimulation with the different agonists was measured as described
previously using the spectrofluorometric method (11). fluorescence
measurements were converted to [ca21]i by determining maximal fluorescence (fmax) with  xxxd2379xxx  (8 mmol/l, final concentration) followed by minimal fluorescence (fmin) with 10 mmol/l ethyleneglycolbis-(b-aminoethyl ether)-n,n,n9,n9-tetraacetic acid, ph 810. [ca21]i was
calculated according to the method of grynkiewicz (26), assuming a
dissociation constant of fura-2 for calcium of 224 nmol/l.

preparation of uterine lysate
human uterine samples in the proliferative phase of the menstrual
cycle obtained at surgery were minced with sharp scissors, suspended
in lysis buffer (20 mmol/l tris, ph 7.4; 150 mmol/l nacl; 0.25%
nonidet p-40; 1 mmol/l na3vo4; and 1 mmol/l phenylmethylsulfonylfluoride), and homogenized (teflon-glass). the homogenates were
centrifuged at 1500 rpm for 10 min at 4 c, and supernatants corresponding to total lysates were subjected to protein measurement.

sperm membrane preparation
spermatozoa stored in liquid nitrogen were lysed in lysis buffer for
1 h on ice. then, the samples were subjected to two subsequent cycles
of homogenizing (teflon-glass) and sonicating (three times, 15-s 8 burst).
the homogenates were centrifuged at 1,500 rpm for 10 min at 4 c, and
supernatants were ultracentrifuged at 48,000 rpm for 45 min at 4 c. the
resulting pellets (cellular membranes) were resuspended in lysis buffer
and homogenized. the supernatants (cytosolic fractions) were dried in
a speed vacuum and resuspended in lysis buffer. proteins were measured in cell lysates using a bio-rad kit (bio-rad, hercules, ca).

sds-page
after 5-h capacitation in 0.3% bsa-containing htf, sperm samples
were processed for sds-page as previously described (22, 27). briefly,
they were centrifuged at 400 3 g at 4 c for 10 min, washed twice in pbs,
and resuspended in 10 ml lysis buffer. after measurement of proteins,
the sperm extracts, containing approximately 30 –50 mg proteins, were
diluted in equal volume of 2-fold concentrated laemmli sample buffer,
vortexed, incubated at 95 c for 5 min, and then loaded onto 10% polyacrylamide-bisacrylamide gels. after sds-page, proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (sigma chemical co.).

ligand blot analysis
the nitrocellulose was incubated for 30 min in 3% nonidet p-40/pbs,
then for 2 h in 0.3% bsa/0.1% tween-20/pbs, for 10 min in 0.1%
tween-20/pbs, and finally overnight in 0.3% bsa/0.1% tween-20/pbs
containing p-pod (0.5 mmol/l) in the presence or absence of a high
concentration of free p (10 mmol/l). after several washes in 0.1%
tween-20/pbs, reacted proteins were simultaneously revealed by an
ecl system (amersham). particular attention was paid in these experiments to treat the samples (with or without free p) simultaneously and
for exactly the same incubation times.

western blot analysis
transferred nitrocellulose was blocked for 3 h at room temperature
in ttbs (0.1 tween-20, 20 mmol/l tris, and 150 mmol/l nacl) con-

taining 5% bsa, then washed repeatedly in ttbs and incubated for 2 h
in 2% bsa-ttbs containing ac262 (1:400). after washing, nitrocellulose
were incubated with goat antimouse igg-pod (1:5000 in 2% bsa-ttbs).
in other experiments, different primary antibodies were used (apr and
adnabd-pr, 1:100 dilution). after several washes in ttbs, reacted
proteins were revealed by the ecl system (amersham).

ar assay
acrosome-reacted spermatozoa were evaluated using the fluorescent
probe fitc-labeled arachis hypogea (peanut) lectin according to the
method of aitken (28) as previously described (29). briefly, after 2-h
capacitation, spermatozoa (106/ml) were preincubated for 30 min with
ac262 antibody or apr (1:100) and then stimulated with p (10 mmol/l),
a23187 (10 mmol/l), or the appropriate control solvent (dimethylsulfoxide) for 2 h at 37 c. after staining with fluorescent lectin, fluorescence
was observed under a fluorescent microscope (type 307–148.002, leitz,
wetzlar, germany), and the ar was evaluated on a total of 100 spermatozoa/slide. using the method of aitken (28), only curly-tailed spermatozoa were considered viable and thus scored.

analysis of experimental results
the binding data were evaluated quantitatively with nonlinear least
squares curve fitting using the computer program ligand (30). the
program provides objective measures of goodness of fit in terms of both
magnitude and randomness of residuals. the computer program allfit
(31) was used for the analysis of sigmoidal dose-response curves obtained in binding and calcium studies. ar data were analyzed by student’s t test and one-way anova after data transformation in arcsins
of the root square. each data point represents the mean 6 sem.

results
competitive equilibrium binding studies in human
spermatozoa

to identify and pharmacologically characterize p-binding
sites on human spermatozoa, we performed binding studies
in pooled capacitated human spermatozoa using progesterone-11a-glucuronide-[125i]iodotyramine as tracer (fig. 1, inset). preliminary time-course experiments indicated that progesterone-11a-glucuronide-[125i]iodotyramine binding was
time dependent and reached apparent equilibrium within 60
min at 4 c (fig. 1). accordingly, all subsequent binding

experiments were conducted using these experimental conditions. the steric compliance and the hydrophilic properties
of the substitution group should prevent 11a-glucuronide[125i]iodotyramine from crossing the plasmalemma, as indicated by the dramatic decrease in radioactivity (73.96 6
0.74%; n 5 10) after acid washing of samples. to exclude the
possibility that binding of progesterone-11a-glucuronide[125i]iodotyramine to bsa could be responsible for the observed binding, these experiments were also conducted in
the absence of bsa with results similar to those obtained in
its presence (results not shown).
figure 2 shows a typical scatchard plot for progesterone11a-glucuronide-[125i]iodotyramine binding to human spermatozoa. the curvilinear relationship indicates heterogeneity of p binding in human spermatozoa. to further
characterize p-binding sites, we performed 10 experiments of
competition curves for progesterone-11a-glucuronide[125i]iodotyramine binding using increasing concentrations
of p, 17aohp, and 11bohp as competitors for the radioactive tracer. competition experiments were conducted in
sperm derived from different subjects or in pooled sperm
from different donors (n 5 10). simultaneous mathematical
analysis of experimental results strongly indicated the presence of at least two distinct classes of sites. the introduction
of a second independent class of sites dramatically improved
the fitting of experimental results (p , 0.0001). a typical
family of competition curves is shown in fig. 3. affinity
constants and concentrations of receptors are reported in
table 1. we found a high affinity, low capacity binding site
that is apparently selective for p and a low affinity, high
capacity site that binds with virtually equal affinity all three
progestins. note that gaba, dht, and  xxxd2754xxx  did not
displace binding even at micromolar concentrations. to exclude the possibility that displacement of radioactive tracer
by p might be due to induction of the ar and, thus, loss of
acrosome in a high percentage of cells, we evaluated the ar
in spermatozoa treated with p (1 nmol/l, 0.1 mmol/l, and

intact spermatozoa (8 3 106) were incubated at 4 c in the presence of 77
pmol/l progesterone-11a-glucuronide[125i]iodotyramine for the indicated
times. specific binding was determined
by subtracting nonspecific (obtained
with 10 mmol/l p) from total binding. in
the inset, the molecular structure of
progesterone-11a-glucuronide[125i]iodotyramine is shown.

by tesarik and mendoza (32) using fitc-bsa-conjugated p.
effects of different steroids and other agonists on [ca21]i in
human spermatozoa

to investigate the biological function of the two binding
sites identified with equilibrium binding studies, we evaluated the effects of increasing concentrations of p, 17aohp,
and 11bohp on [ca21]i of fura-2-loaded spermatozoa. fig-

ure 4 reports the percent increase in [ca21]i in response to
increasing concentrations of p, 17aohp, and 11bohp, as
generated by the computer program allfit after simultaneous
analysis of the different curves. the dose-response curve for
p was clearly biphasic, with a first component in the nanomolar range (ec50 5 55.6 6 15.4 nmol/l; n 5 12) and a
second component in the micromolar range (ec50 5 40.1 6
20.1 mmol/l; n 5 12). on the contrary, dose-response curves
for 17aohp and 11bohp were monophasic, with ec50 values, respectively, of 53.4 6 41.4 mmol/l (n 5 7) and 5.8 6 4.4
mmol/l (n 5 8). a significant correlation was observed between pk and logec50 (r 5 0.946; p 5 0.05). interestingly, at
low concentrations (10 –50 nmol/l), the intracellular calcium
increase in response to p was significantly higher (p , 0.05)
than that of the other steroids, whereas at micromolar concentrations, the three progestins induced similar responses,
as previously reported (11, 33). the addition of different

ide) did not modify sperm [ca21]i (not shown). in table 2, the
percent stimulation of [ca21]i vs. basal in response to several
agonists at two different concentrations is reported. at the
concentration of 50 nmol/l, only p induced a significant
response, whereas at 50 mmol/l p, 11bohp and 17aohp
stimulated a similar influx of calcium. the other tested molecules did not stimulate an appreciable increase in sperm
[ca21]i (table 2).
in somatic cells, agonists whose biological effects are mediated by membrane receptors are subjected to a phenomenon termed desensitization or down-regulation (34). we
tested the possibility that this also occurs in human spermatozoa stimulated with progestins by measuring the effect
of two repeated administrations of steroid on [ca21]i. as
shown in fig. 5, a first dose of 50 nmol/l p induced an
increase in [ca21]i that could not be reproduced by a subsequent equimolar administration of the same agonist (fig.
5a), indicating the occurrence of homologous desensitization
(34). no response and no modification of the response to
subsequent administration of p were observed with 50
nmol/l 11bohp or 17aohp (not shown). at the concentration of 50 mmol/l, homologous and heterologous (34)
desensitization occurred with all three steroids. at this concentration, a first administration of p (fig. 5b) or 11bohp
(fig. 5c) induced similar intracellular calcium transients (see
also table 2), which was not followed by a response to a
subsequent equimolar dose of p (compared with the response to p in the same subject; fig. 5d). similar results were
obtained with 17aohp (not shown).
as stated above, controversial results have been obtained
concerning the possible involvement of gabaa receptors in
calcium transients stimulated by p (10 –14). we have reexamined this issue by studying the direct effects of gaba on
basal and p-stimulated [ca21]i as well as on ar. as shown
in fig. 6, gaba did not stimulate an increase in [ca21]i at
either low (50 nmol/l; fig. 6a) or high (50 mmol/l; fig. 6c)
concentrations. moreover, gaba did not affect calcium transient in response to a subsequent equimolar administration
of p at both low (fig. 6, a vs. b) and high (fig. 6, c vs. d)
concentrations compared to the respective control values. in
addition, in our hands, gaba at concentrations ranging
from 50 nmol/l to 50 mmol/l did not induce acrosome
reaction of capacitated human spermatozoa or modify the
response to p (percent ar; mean 6 sem of three experiments;

identification of p-binding proteins on human spermatozoa

to identify the molecular mass of p-binding proteins in
capacitated human spermatozoa, we performed ligand blot
experiments using p-pod (0.5 mmol/l) as probe. this molecule has been shown to be effective in inducing ar in
human spermatozoa (13) and thus is an interesting tool to
perform this type of experiment. as shown in fig. 7a, p-pod
identifies two protein bands on total sperm lysate (right panel)
of 54 and 57 kda, which totally disappear when p-pod is
added in the presence of a high concentration (10 mmol/l)
of free p (left panel), suggesting that these proteins bind p in
a specific manner. these results have been consistently reproduced in six different sperm samples.
we also performed western blot experiments using the
monoclonal antibody ac262, which is directed against the
c-terminal tail of genomic p receptor (35). recent data demonstrated that this antibody is able to counteract the effect of
p in human spermatozoa and stains some protein bands in
sperm lysates (19). as shown in fig. 7b (left panel), western
blot immunostaining of sperm lysates with ac262 identified
two protein bands of similar molecular mass (57 and 54 kda)
as those revealed by ligand blot with p-pod (fig. 7a) and an
additional band at 66 kda. in uterine lysates, used as a control

7b, left panel), whereas in the cytosolic fraction, only the
66-kda band was observed.
in table 3, we summarize the results of western and ligand
blot experiments on sperm p-binding proteins (six experiments for ligand and four experiments for western blot). we
believe that only the 54- and 57-kda proteins are specific
p-binding proteins, as only these two proteins were detected
by both ac262 and p-pod and disappeared when p-pod was
used in the presence of a high concentration of free p (table
3). moreover, our results confirm that genomic p receptors
are not present in spermatozoa (37), as no protein bands are
detected by the antibody directed against the dna-binding
domain of genomic receptor.
we also tried to perform immunoprecipitation of p receptors in sperm lysates with ac262 antibody, but the heavy
chain of the antibody (;60 kda) used to immunoprecipitate
masks the proteins of interest as they comigrate at the same
molecular mass (data not shown).
effects of ac262 and apr antibodies on ar

fig. 6. effects of gaba on sperm [ca21]i and on the calcium response
to p. both low (50 nmol/l; a) and high (50 mmol/l; c) concentrations
of gaba induce a slight decrease in basal [ca21]i without affecting
the calcium response to a subsequent equimolar dose of p (a, 50
nmol/l; c, 50 mmol/l) compared to the relative control value in the
same subjects (b, 50 nmol/l; d, 50 mmol/l).

for p genomic receptor, the antibody detected several bands.
among these, two bands of about 100 –110 and 60 kda, which
correspond to known isoforms of genomic p receptor (35, 36),
are not present in spermatozoa, confirming the absence of
genomic p receptors in these cells (37).
the same sperm and uterine total lysates as those in fig.
7b (left panel) were stained with antibodies directed against
different regions of the genomic p receptor, respectively the
n-terminal (apr) and the dna-binding domains of the
genomic receptor. interestingly, apr detected only the 66kda band (fig. 7b, right panel), whereas no protein bands
were revealed by the antibody directed against the dnabinding domain (data not shown), indicating that the putative 57- and 54-kda p-binding proteins do not show homology with the classical nuclear receptor family at the
n-terminal and dna-binding sequences. to exclude the
possibility that the 66-kda protein band detected with a-c262
and apr is due to the residual presence of bsa, we performed western blot analysis of bsa standard with the two
antibodies. in this case, no protein bands were detected (not
shown), indicating that the 66-kda band revealed in sperm
lysates is indeed a sperm protein.
the possible sperm surface localization of 54- and 57-kda
p-binding proteins was demonstrated by western blot analysis with ac262 of purified sperm membrane and cytosol
shown in fig. 7c. the monoclonal antibody detected the
same three bands of 66, 57, and 54 kda as in total lysate (fig.

as p is a well known stimulus for acrosome reaction (5),
we investigated whether ac262 antibody affected this effect.
human capacitated spermatozoa were stimulated with p (10
mmol/l) in the presence or absence of monoclonal antibody
ac262 or apr antibody (1:100 dilution). as shown in table 4,
ac262 antibody did not alter the spontaneous ar, whereas it
totally blunted the effect of p. no effects of the antibody were
observed on a23187-induced ar (data not shown). these
results strongly indicate that the membrane p54 and p57
proteins revealed by ac262 are involved in transducing p
biological effects in human spermatozoa. conversely, the
apr antibody, which did not detect the 57- and 54-kda protein bands, but only the 66-kda one, in western blot analysis
of sperm lysates, did not inhibit the p-stimulated ar (table
4), suggesting that the 66-kda band is not involved in mediating p activity.
discussion

the present study demonstrates the presence of distinct
membrane surface receptors for p in capacitated human spermatozoa. this result is supported by data obtained using
three different experimental approaches: binding on intact
spermatozoa, ligand blot, and western blot analysis in sperm
lysates. the biological functions of these receptors in human
spermatozoa were established by measuring intracellular
calcium fluxes in response to different concentrations of p
and other agonists.
computerized analysis of binding displacement curves
with the program ligand strongly indicates the presence of
two distinct p-binding sites on human spermatozoa. the
high affinity, low capacity site is displaced, among the different molecules used in our experiments, only by p, whereas
the low affinity, high capacity site is displaced by p, 11bohp,
17aohp, and ru486. both binding sites appear to be relevant for p-induced calcium fluxes in human spermatozoa.
indeed, we found that the dose-response curve of p-induced
[ca21]i increase was characterized by two distinct components, with ec50 values, respectively, in the nanomolar and
in the micromolar ranges, whereas dose-response curves for

11bohp and 17aohp were characterized by a single component with an ec50 in the micromolar range. most relevant,
ec50 values for [ca21]i dose-response curves and binding
affinity constants for the three progestins were correlated,
indicating that the two surface receptors identified with equilibrium binding studies are involved in p-induced calcium
influx. as p is present at micromolar levels in the cumulus
oophorus surrounding the oocyte (3), it can virtually bind
both the high and low affinity receptors present on spermatozoa; hence, it can be hypothesized that both sites are physiologically involved in the action of the steroid in human
spermatozoa. moreover, the ability of other molecules sharing a progestin structure, such as 17aohp and 11bohp, to
displace the low affinity site suggests that 17aohp, which is
also present in high concentrations in follicular fluid and
cumulus matrix (3), might be physiologically relevant during
the process of fertilization. the low affinity site is also displaced by ru486, a potent antagonist of the genomic p receptor. this finding is consistent with its reported inhibition
of p biological effects in human spermatozoa when used at
micromolar doses (38). in a previous report, neulen et al. (39),
using [3h]p as ligand, found a single site for p with a kd of
about 10 nmol/l in human seminal plasma and spermatozoa. however, a comparison of these results with the present
data is difficult, because these researchers used as tracer
[3h]p, which can easily cross the plasma membrane, and
performed most of the experiments in seminal plasma (39).
ligand blot analysis of sperm lysates using p-pod identified
two protein bands of about 57 and 54 kda that were displaced
in the presence of unconjugated p. two proteins with similar
molecular masses were also identified by western blot analysis
of sperm proteins with an antibody directed against the cterminal domain of the p genomic receptor (a-c262). at present,
we do not have any evidence that these two proteins are related
to the two receptors evidentiated with equilibrium binding
studies. on the other hand, the inhibitory effect of the a-c262
antibody of p-induced ar (ref. 19 and the present study) and
the increase in [ca21]i (19) strongly suggests that the proteins
detected with this antibody are involved in the biological effects
of p. p-pod has been used as a probe in ligand blot analysis of

fig. 7. a, ligand blot analysis of whole human sperm lysates using
p-pod to reveal p-binding proteins. sperm proteins (50 mg/lane)
separated by reducing 10% sds-page were blotted with p-pod (0.5
mmol/l) in the absence (left panel) or presence (right panel) of an
excess of free p (10 mmol/l). on sperm lysates, p-pod reveals two

protein bands (arrowheads) of 57 and 54 kda (left panel) that disappear in the presence of free p (right panel). similar results were
obtained in four different experiments. molecular mass markers are
indicated on both sides of the figure. b, western blot analysis of whole
human sperm and uterine lysates with antibodies directed against
different domains of the genomic p receptor. sperm and uterine proteins (50 mg/lane) separated by reducing 10% sds-page were revealed by ac262 (1:400 dilution; left panel) and apr (1:100 dilution;
right panel). on sperm lysates, ac262 detects three protein bands of
66, 57, and 54 kda (left panel), whereas apr reveals the 66-kda band
only (right panel). on uterine lysates, both antibodies reveal a similar
pattern of proteins. similar results were obtained in four different
experiments. molecular mass markers are indicated to the right of
both panels. c, western blot analysis of human sperm membrane and
cytosolic lysates with ac262. total, membrane, and cytosolic proteins
(30 mg), obtained as described in materials and methods, were separated by reducing 10% sds-page and revealed by ac262 (1:400
dilution). in particulate membranes, three proteins of 66, 57, and 54
kda apparent molecular mass were detected, whereas in the cytosolic
fraction only the 66-kda band was detected. molecular mass markers
are indicated to the right of figure.

in western analysis, antibodies directed against different domains of progesterone genomic receptor, respectively against c-terminal
progesterone-binding sequence (ac262), n-terminal sequence (apr), and dna-binding sequence (adnabd-pr), were used. in ligand blot
analysis, p-pod in the presence or absence of free progesterone (p) was used as probe. the mol wt of protein bands are the mean 6 sem of at

sperm proteins by benoff et al. (18), who identified two proteins
of 70 and 58 kda present on sperm crude membranes. it must
be also mentioned that in western blot analysis of sperm proteins with a-c262 antibody, sauber et al. (19) detected two major
proteins with molecular masses of 50–52 and 46–48 kda and
additional bands at lower molecular masses. the discrepancies
in apparent molecular mass of the two p-binding proteins identified in these studies may be due to covalent modifications
(glycosylation, phosphorylation) of the proteins that could be
altered by the different methods of protein preparation. among
proteins capable of binding p, cortisol-binding globulin (40) and
albumin (41) show molecular masses similar to those of p54 and
p57. using pure bsa as a positive control, we excluded ac262
cross-reaction with albumin, confirming data reported by benoff et al. (18). in addition, sauber et al. (19) did not detect any
immunoreactivity with antibody against cortisol-binding globulin in washed spermatozoa. in our study we detected an additional protein band at 66 kda, which is also present in western blot performed with an antibody directed against a different
domain of the p genomic receptor (apr). however, the lack of
effect of this antibody on p-stimulated ar suggests that this
band is not specific and is not involved in the biological effect
of the steroid. using proteins lysates from partially purified
sperm membranes, we demonstrated that the two binding proteins of 57 and 54 kda are selectively localized in the membranes and absent in the cytosol, in agreement with immunofluorescence studies demonstrating surface localization of the
staining with a-c262 (19). recently, high affinity binding sites
for p have been characterized and purified in porcine liver
membranes (42). interestingly, binding studies using [3h]p as
ligand identified two binding sites for p with apparent kd
values of 11 and 286 nmol/l, while purification of p-binding
proteins revealed the presence of two proteins of 56 and 28 kda
(42). from these studies it appears that nongenomic p receptors
show profound structural and functional differences compared
to the genomic receptor family. in keeping with this conclusion,
spermatozoa from transgenic mice lacking the nuclear genomic
p receptor show normal surface p receptors (43), suggesting the

presence of two different genes encoding for genomic and nongenomic receptors for the steroid.
as stated above, the possible involvement of gaba receptors in the mechanism of action of p in mammalian sperm
is still a matter of discussion, as both positive (9, 10, 14) and
negative (11–13) results have been reported. binding sites for
gaba have been shown in spermatozoa (9, 44). however,
competitive displacement of [3h]gaba tracer by nipecotic
acid, a blocker of  xxxg2146xxx , suggests the presence of gaba transport proteins more than true gaba
receptors (44). [3h]gaba transport has been demonstrated
in human spermatozoa (45). by immunofluorescence studies,
a gabaa receptor/cl2 channel complex has been localized
on the surface of the sperm head at the equatorial segment
(9). it has been proposed that the effects of p may be mediated
by such a channel on the surface of human sperm (8). however, despite different results obtained in mice (10), gaba
has been reported to only weakly stimulate the ar in human
spermatozoa (9) and, in contrast to the effects of p, to be
devoid of stimulatory effects on sperm-oocyte fusion (13). at
least in the mouse, the effect of gaba appears to be mediated
by the influx of calcium (10). we were unable to demonstrate
any effect of gaba on ar in either the absence or presence
of p. moreover, our data confirm that gaba does not stimulate an influx of calcium in human spermatozoa or modify
p-induced calcium influx, as reported previously (11–13). in
addition, competitive binding studies demonstrate no interaction of gaba with either the high or the low affinity
p-binding sites. taken together, our results seem to exclude
the involvement of gaba receptors in calcium signaling
stimulated by p in human spermatozoa. in a recent report,
meizel et al. (14) demonstrated, by image analysis of single
sperm cells loaded with fura-2, that the effect of p could be
partially reverted by  xxxd2947xxx , suggesting the involvement
of gabaa receptors. however, direct effects of gaba on
calcium influx were not investigated in this study (14), and
using an identical experimental approach, aitken et al. (13)
did not demonstrate any effect of gaba on sperm calcium.

nongenomic p receptors on human spermatozoa

as the p-induced ar clearly requires chloride efflux and
activation of gabaa receptor/cl2 channel complex (8), it is
possible that p receptors and gabaa receptor/cl2 channel
complex are distinct and cooperate to induce the ar.
in conclusion, our results demonstrated the presence of two
functional membrane p receptors in human spermatozoa. the
p54 and p57 p-binding molecules detected in our study may
represent novel nongenomic p receptors on human sperm
membrane that can mediate the steroid effects. isolation, sequencing, and further functional characterization of these two
protein candidates of nongenomic p receptors are presently
under investigation in our laboratory. as we have recently
shown that a correlation exists between sperm responsiveness
to p and sperm fertilizing ability (29, 46), identification and
characterization of nongenomic p receptor(s) may be clinically
relevant not only in future research in male infertility, but also
in the development of new contraceptive tools.
