abstract. multidrug-resistance (mdr) is largely caused by the
efflux of therapeutics from the tumor cell by means of pglycoprotein ( xxxg10xxx ), resulting in reduced efficacy of the
chemotherapy. in order to overcome mdr, substances, such
as verapamil and  xxxd1781xxx  (csa), were employed. as
these  xxxg10xxx  modulating agents did not seem promising in
clinical practice, new compounds with a low degree of
undesirable side effects, were introduced. in this study,
bisindolic alkaloid  xxxd3523xxx  was examined for its possible
capability of enhancing the cytotoxic effect of doxorubicin
(dox) on drug resistant cells. two different pairs of tumor
cell lines were analyzed: the parental lymphoblastoid cell
line cem-wt and its mdr derivative cem-r, the parental
osteosarcoma cell line u-2 os-wt and its resistant
counterpart u-2 os-r. these cell lines were characterized
for their morphological features by scanning electron
microscopy (sem) and for the expression of the main drug
transporters by flow cytometric analysis. the effects of
 xxxd3523xxx  on the cell survival and on both accumulation and
efflux of dox were then investigated. the intracellular
distribution of dox, given alone or in association with csa
or  xxxd3523xxx , was observed by laser scanning confocal
microscopy. a differential effect of  xxxd3523xxx  between
sensitive and resistant cells on the intracellular dox
concentration and distribution was shown. in particular,
 xxxd3523xxx  induced a significant increase of drug retention
and intranuclear location in resistant cells. the results of cell
survival experiments revealed an enhancement of the
cytotoxic effect of dox induced by  xxxd3523xxx , confirmed
by evident morphological changes observed by sem. these
findings suggest promising applications of this natural
substance against mdr tumors.

introduction
multidrug-resistance (mdr) in tumor cells is an adverse
factor for the efficacy of several chemo therapeutic treatments.
the mdr phenotype can be either intrinsic or acquired, both
in vitro and in vivo, after the exposure of tumor cells to
antineoplastic agents. the acquired resistance may involve a
broad range of structurally unrelated compounds.
mdr is often associated with changes in the intracellular
drug accumulation (1) and distribution (2,3). thus, in many
tumor types, the alteration of the expression of transport
proteins, such as p-glycoprotein ( xxxg10xxx ) (4,5) and multidrug
resistance-associated protein (mrp) (6), acting as atpdependent drug efflux pumps, was related to the occurrence of
resistance to cytotoxic agents. another protein overexpressed in
mdr tumor cells is the lung resistance-related protein (lrp)
(7) which might be involved in vesicular and nucleocytoplasmatic drug transport (8) but its role in the chemotherapy
resistance is still controversial.
several in vitro and in vivo studies have been performed
to reverse the drug-resistance phenotype and to develop
innovative chemotherapeutic strategies effective against
mdr tumors. most of the mdr modulators, such as some
calcium channel blockers (e.g. verapamil) (9) and immuno­
suppressive agents (e.g.  xxxd1781xxx , csa) (10), induce
competitive inhibition of the  xxxg10xxx  molecule activity.
unfortunately, the use of these substances in vivo implies draw­
backs due to several factors as: i), solid tumors are less
sensitive to mdr modulators than haematological
malignancies, since different mechanisms are responsible for
the drug-resistance; ii), the inhibitory concentration of the
modulators brings about hypotension and heart block
(verapamil), and myelo-suppression (csa); iii), the binding
of these modulating compounds to the serum proteins
decreases their bioavailability.
since these  xxxg10xxx  modulating drugs do not seem
promising in clinical practice, the search for new substances,
effective against resistant tumors and with a low degree of
undesirable side effects, is of primary interest in anticancer
pharmacology. in this regard, three indole alkaloids obtained
from peschiera laeta (family apocynaceae), coronaridine
and particularly the dimer conoduramine and  xxxd3523xxx ,
have previously been seen to enhance the cytotoxic effect of

1506

meschini et al: mdr modulation by  xxxd3523xxx 

vinblastine on drug resistant human oral epidermal carcinoma
(kb-v1) cells (11). twenty-two monomeric and dimeric
indole alkaloids were isolated (12) from the stem and root
bark (1.9% and 2.4%, respectively) of peschiera fuchsiaefolia,
a wild plant controlled by herbicides and known as a field
weed in brazil. the dimeric alkaloids, viz., tabernamine, 16'decarbomethoxyvoacamine, n b -demethyl- xxxd3523xxx ,
voacamidine, ervahanine a and  xxxd3523xxx , are more abundant
in the root bark (total 0.22%) than in the stem bark (total
0.028%).  xxxd3523xxx , the most abundant dimer, showed good
activity against mycobacterium tuberculosis strain h57rv
(minimum inhibition concentration, 3.1 |ig/ml, unpublished
results), in line with the observed activity against gram-positive
bacteria (13). the same alkaloid tested in vitro on plasmodium
falciparum
showed good activity against both the
chloroquine-sensitive d 6 strain (ic 50 =238 ng/ml) and
chloroquine-resistant w2 strain (ic50=290 ng/ml). however,
 xxxd3523xxx  did not enhance the activity of chloroquine
against a resistant strain of p. falciparum (14) and this is a
divergence example for the resistance inversion between
quinoline-resistant plasmodium strains and the mdr
phenotype of mammalian tumor cells (15).
on the basis of these considerations, the aim of the present
study was to investigate the possible mdr modulating activity
of  xxxd3523xxx . two pairs of sensitive and mdr cell lines,
with different histotype and growing conditions, were used:
the human lymphoblastoid cells cem, growing in suspension,
and the human osteosarcoma cells u-2 os, growing adherent
to the substratum.
in particular, we examined: a), the cytotoxic effect
induced by  xxxd3523xxx  on cem and u-2 os cell lines and on
their resistant counterparts; b), the effect of  xxxd3523xxx  on the
intracellular concentration and distribution of doxorubicin
(dox); and c), the possible modulation of the cytotoxic
effect of dox induced by  xxxd3523xxx .
a remarkable increase of drug retention in the presence of
the alkaloid was observed in resistant cells. moreover, cell
survival experiments showed that  xxxd3523xxx  was able to
induce a significant enhancement of the cytotoxic effect of
dox on resistant cells.
materials and methods
cell cultures. the established human leukemic lympho­
blastoid cell line, cem-wt, and its mdr variant,
cem/vlb100 (16), hereafter designated cem-r cells, were
kindly provided by dr. beck, st. jude children's research
hospital, memphis, tn. cem-r cell line was obtained by
exposing the parental drug sensitive cell line to an increasing
sublethal concentration of vinblastine sulphate (eli lilly,
france) up to 100 ng/ml. both cell lines were grown as
suspension in rpmi 1640 medium.
the established human osteosarcoma cell line u-2 os-wt
and its derivative mdr variant u-2 os-r (17) were kindly
provided by dr. k. scotlandi, istituti ortopedici rizzoli,
bologna, italy. u-2 os-r cell line was obtained by exposing
the parental drug sensitive human cell line to increasing
sublethal concentration of dox (adriblastina, pharmacia
and upjohn, milan, italy) up to 580 ng/ml. both cell lines
were grown as monolayers in iscove's modified dulbecco's
medium (imdm, hyclone, carmlington, uk).

all media used for cell culturing were supplemented with
10% fetal bovine serum (fbs) (hyclone, carmlington, uk),
1% penicillin (50 u/ml)-streptomycin (50 u-g/ml) (gibco life
technologies, paisley, uk) in a humidified atmosphere of
5% c0 2 in a water-jacketed incubator at 37°c.
scanning electron microscopy. for scanning electron
microscopy (sem) studies, control and treated cells (dox at
the concentration of 1.7 |ig/ml and/or  xxxd3523xxx  at 1 )j.g/ml
for 4 h at 37°c) were grown on coverslips and fixed with
2.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 m cacodylate buffer (ph 7.3)
added with 2% sucrose at room temperature for 20 min. after
post-fixation with 1% os0 4 in 0.1 m cacodylate buffer (ph
7.3) at room temperature for 30 min, cells were dehydrated
through graded ethanol concentrations, critical point-dried in
c0 2 (cpd 030 baltec device, balzers, liechtenstein) and
gold coated by sputtering (scd 040 balzers device). the
samples were then examined with a cambridge stereoscan
360 scanning electron microscope (cambridge instruments,
cambridge, uk).
 xxxd3523xxx . the root bark of peschiera fuchsiaefolia (d.c.)
miers was provided by mr. s. rossi from cibecol ltda.,
porto alegre, brazil. aqueous acetic acid (2%) was added to
the ground vegetable material and the solution was
alkalinized (ph 9.0) with sodium hydroxide and extracted
with dichloromethane. the basic extract of the tertiary
alkaloids was submitted to counter-current distribution
between dichloromethane and a citrate-phosphate buffer at
decreasing ph (from 6.0 to 2.2).  xxxd3523xxx  was thus
isolated (0.12%) [a]20d: -54° (chc13), and identified by ms
as well as by 'h- and 13c-nmr (18).
the alkaloid was dissolved in dmso (panreacquimicasa,
barcelona, spain) at 100 fig/ml and then diluted, at the final
concentration, in culture medium.
mab reagents. for flow cytometric analysis, cell surface pgp was labeled with mabs mm4.17 (19) or mrk16
(kamiya, thousand oaks, ca). mab mm4.17 is an igg2ak
monoclonal immunoglobulin reacting with a continuous
linear epitope on the apex of the 4th loop of  xxxg10xxx . this mab
specifically recognizes a distinct human-specific epitope of
the extracellular domain of the mdrl- xxxg10xxx  isoform. the
optimal concentration for these studies was 10 \iglm\.
mab mrk16 is an igg2a monoclonal immunoglobulin
that recognizes a conformational epitope distributed on the
1st and 4th loop of  xxxg10xxx  molecule. the concentration used
for these studies was 10 u.g/ml.
mab mrprl (kamiya) and mab qcrl-1 (alexis
biochemicals, san diego, ca) were employed for mrp
detection. mab mrprl is a rat igg2a that reacts with an internal
epitope of  xxxg13xxx   xxxg1448xxx  and does not cross-react with the human
mdrl gene product (20). the optimal concentration for this
antibody in flow cytometry was 1 p.g/ml. mab qcrl-1 is a
murine igg, which recognizes a linear epitope of mrp and does
not cross-react with the human mdrl and  xxxg12xxx  gene product
(21). this antibody was used at a concentration of 0.6 u.g/ml.
for lrp detection, mabs lrp-56 (igg 2b , signet
laboratories inc., dedham, ma) and lrp-42 (igg,, trans-

international journal of oncology 23: 1505-1513, 2003

duction laboratories, lexington, ky) directed against
different epitopes of lrp (22,23) were employed. these
mabs were used at a final working concentration of 0.2
|ig/ml and 0.5 u,g/ml, respectively.
the control isotype antibodies used were obtained from
sigma chemical company (st. louis, mo).
flow cytometry. all flow cytometric analyses were carried
out on cell suspensions (106 cells/ml) obtained by incubating
monolayer cell cultures with edta and trypsin.
for the determination of cell surface  xxxg10xxx , the cells were
incubated for 30 min at 4°c with primary mab and then with
a secondary antibody in pbs containing 1% bsa, 10% fbs
and 10% human ab serum. after washing, cells were
immediately analyzed. dead cells were excluded from the
analysis by adding  xxxd3027xxx  iodide (pi, sigma) to the cell
suspensions before the acquisitions.
in order to detect the intracellular expression of lrp
and mrp, cell suspensions were fixed with 2% para­
formaldehyde in a phosphate buffered solution (pbs) for 10
min at 4°c. the samples were then permeabilized by adding
0.05% triton x-100 for 10 min at 4°c. incubation with
primary (respectively lrp-56 or lrp-42 and qcrl-1 or
mrprl) and secondary (goat anti-mouse or anti-rat iggfluorescein conjugate) antibodies were performed for 30 min
at 4°c in pbs containing 1% bsa, 10% fbs and 10%
human ab serum. for negative controls, cells were labeled
with mouse or rat isotypic globulins.
the analysis of the drug accumulation was performed on
cells treated with 1.7 (ig/ml dox alone or in combination
with  xxxg10xxx  modulator csa (5 |lim) or the natural compound
 xxxd3523xxx  (1 fig/ml) for 6 h. at the end of treatments, cells
were washed with ice-cold hank's  xxxd2988xxx 
(hbss, sigma), detached with edta and trypsin,
resuspended in ice-cold pbs and immediately analyzed for
dox content.
in the drug efflux studies, after 30 min of treatment with
1.7 p.g/ml dox, cells were washed with ice-cold hbss,
reincubated at 37°c in a drug-free medium with or without  xxxg10xxx 
modulator csa or the natural compound  xxxd3523xxx . after 3 h
cells were detached with edta and trypsin, resuspended in
ice-cold pbs and immediately analyzed for dox content.
all fluorescences were analyzed with a facscan flow
cytometer (becton dickinson, mountain view, ca) equipped
with a 15-mw, 488 nm, and an air-cooled argon ion laser.
the fluorescent emissions were collected through a 530 nm
band-pass filter for fluorescein, a 575 nm band-pass filter for
dox or pi and a 670 nm band-pass filter for trypan blue
(tb, sigma) and acquired in log mode. at least 10,000
events were analyzed. for dox content studies, the intensity
of the drug fluorescence was expressed as mean fluorescence
channel (mfc) calculated from the flow cytometric profiles
by the cellquest software (becton dickinson). the efflux rate
was calculated by the formula (mfcacc- mfccff)/ mfcacc where
the mfcacc is the fluorescence intensity at the end of the
accumulation phase (30 min) and mfcefr is the fluorescence
intensity after 3 h efflux. the percentage of cells positive to
tb was calculated for the tb exclusion method. for the
quantitative evaluation of the protein expression, mfc was
calculated by cellquest software.

laser scanning confocal microscopy. the analysis of the
intracellular distribution of dox was carried out on living
cells, treated as described in the flow cytometry section and
mounted on glass microscope slides. in order to avoid cell
damage, the image acquisition was made quickly on several
cells presented on different slides for each sample and
capturing signals from one field per slide. the observation of
living cells was carried out using a leica tcs 4d laser
scanning confocal microscopy (leica microsystems,
mannheim, germany) equipped with an ar/kr laser. dox was
excited at a wavelength of 488 nm, the fluorescence emission
was collected after passing through long-pass filters of 510
nm. acquisition parameters: objective 40.0/1.0 oil: pinhole
size 113; x, y pixel size 0.13 \x,m; z pixel size 0.58 |im; step
size 0.58 |im.
cell survival assays. in order to evaluate the viability of the
cem cells, trypan blue (tb) exclusion method was carried
out. cells were treated for 4 h at 37°c with dox at a
concentration of 1.7 |ig/ml and/or  xxxd3523xxx  at 1 fig/ml,
resuspended in ice-cold pbs, stained with tb at a final
concentration of 80 |jm and immediately analyzed by flow
cytometry.
the clonogenic survival test was used to determine the
sensitivity of osteosarcoma cells to dox and dox plus
 xxxd3523xxx . the experiments were carried out using semiconfluent cells incubated for 24 h at 37°c with dox at a
concentration of 1.7 |ig/ml with and without  xxxd3523xxx  1 (ig/
ml). cells (2xl03) for u-2 os-wt and 4xl0 3 cells for u-2
os-r were plated in tissue-culture dishes (60 mm) and then
incubated at 37°c. the cytotoxicity was evaluated by using a
cloning efficiency assay, thus determining the cell ability to
reproduce and form macroscopic colonies (>50 cells). after 8
days, colonies were fixed with 95% ethanol, stained with
 xxxd2610xxx  and counted manually. the percentage of cell
survival was determined by the ratio between the mean
number of colonies in treated and control samples.
statistical analysis. the values reported in the figures are the
means ± standard deviation (sd) from three independent
experiments. statistical analyses were performed using
student's t-test. a p-value lower than 0.01 was considered
significant.
results
cell line characterization. in the present study, two different
pairs of established human cell lines were examined: the
parental drug sensitive lymphoblastoid cell line cem-wt
and its mdr deriviate, cem-r, made resistant by prolonged
treatment with vinblastine; the parental drug sensitive
osteosarcoma cell line u-2 os-wt and its mdr variant u-2
os-r, selected by continuous exposure to increasing
concentration of dox. the two resistant cell lines were
characterized in previous studies for their sensitivity to the
cytotoxic treatment and the expression of transporter
molecules. in particular, cem-r cells were about 270 times
more resistant to dox treatment than cem-wt cells, while
the u-2 os-r osteosarcoma cell resistance index against
dox was about 600 (17). with regard to the surface  xxxg10xxx

expression, both the parental cell lines were negative while
both the resistant variants were strongly positive (16,17).
however, before investigating the potentiality of  xxxd3523xxx 
as chemosensitizing agent, we first analysed the expression
of the three main drug transporters ( xxxg10xxx , mrp and lrp) on
four cell lines by using two different mabs for each of them.
fig. 1 shows the cytofluorimetic profiles obtained by
labeling  xxxg10xxx  (a), mrp (b), and lrp (c) with the specific
mabs mrk-16, qcrl-1 and lrp-56, respectively. the use
of alternative mabs, such as mm4.17, mrpr-1 and lrp-42,
gave similar results. as shown in fig. la, both resistant cell
lines were confirmed as strongly positive for  xxxg10xxx  labeling,
whereas the wild-type counterparts did not express this
protein pump on their cell surface. conversely, no significant
difference could be detected between mdr and sensitive
cells on the expression of mrp (b) and lrp (c).
lymphoblastoid cem cells and osteosarcoma u-2 os
cells showed their typical morphology. observed by sem,
cem cells, growing in suspension, appeared roundish with
numerous surface microvilli (fig. 2a) whereas u-2 os cells,
growing adherent to the substratum, appeared to be very flat
and exhibited a polygonal shape with the surface covered by
randomly distributed microvilli (fig. 2b). the induction of
the mdr phenotype did not produce any appreciable morpho­
logical change; in fact, both cem-r and u-2 os-r cells
appeared to be very similar to their respective sensitive
counterparts.

both sensitive and resistant osteosarcoma cell lines, as well as
the resistant variant of cem cell line, were completely
unaffected by the  xxxd3523xxx  treatment. a significant cytotoxic
effect was observed only in wild-type cem cells after treatment
with the highest concentration (10 jxg/ml) of the alkaloid.
effect of  xxxd3523xxx  on intracellular concentration and
distribution of dox. since the cytotoxic effect of a drug is
generally related to its intracellular concentration and
distribution, we analyzed the possible effect of  xxxd3523xxx  on
the accumulation, efflux and distribution of dox, one of the
main antitumoral chemotherapie agents, on the same cell
models. taking advantage of the intrinsic fluorescence of this

anthracyclinic compound, its concentration, in both uptake
and efflux phases was determined cytofluorimetrically while
the intracellular distribution was analysed by laser scanning
confocal microscopy (lscm). these parameters were
evaluated on cells treated with dox, with a combination of
dox plus  xxxd3523xxx  and, as a control, with the association
of dox and csa, a well-known  xxxg10xxx  inhibitor. on the basis
of results obtained from the cell survival assay,  xxxd3523xxx 
was administered at a concentration of 1 (ig/ml. interestingly,
neither  xxxd3523xxx  nor csa had a significant effect on dox
accumulation in both the sensitive wild-type cell lines (cemwt: fig. 4a, left columns; u-2 os-wt: fig. 4b, left columns)
whereas in resistant variants, the presence of  xxxd3523xxx 
induced a remarkable increase in drug accumulation. this
effect was similar, even though to a lesser extent, to that
induced by csa (cem-r: fig. 4a, right columns; u-2 os-r:
fig. 4b, right columns).

cells treated with dox in the presence of  xxxd3523xxx  (b) or csa (c), the drug localization was not modified, the nuclei being similarly positive. conversely,
the nuclei of u-2 os-r cells treated with dox showed to be negative and a weak fluorescent signals could be observed in the cytoplasm (d). when resistant

to those observed in sensitive cells, with the nuclei strongly positive. scale bar, 20 |im.

the role of  xxxd3523xxx  in regulating the dox transport was
further demonstrated by determining the percentage of efflux.
the drug efflux rate in sensitive cell lines was not affected by
the presence of  xxxd3523xxx  or csa (cem-wt: fig. 5a, left
columns; u-2 os-wt: fig. 5b, left columns) whereas in the

resistant cells a significant increase in the drug retention was
observed in the presence of both modulating agents (cem-r:
fig. 5a, right columns; u-2 os-r: fig. 5b, right columns).
in addition, the observations performed by lscm
indicated a different effect of  xxxd3523xxx  on the intracellular

distribution of dox between sensitive and resistant cells.
this parameter can be better studied on flat and adherent
cells with a low nucleus to cytoplasm ratio. thus, only the
results of the tests carried out on osteosarcoma cells are
reported herein. as expected, in sensitive u-2 os-wt cells
treated with dox, the fluorescent drug molecules were
located mainly inside the nuclei (fig. 6a). in many cells, a
cytoplasmic punctate pattern was also observed. when the
treatment with dox was carried out in the presence of
 xxxd3523xxx  (fig. 6b) or csa (fig. 6c) the intracellular drug
distribution did not appear to be substantially modified; the
nuclei of the wild-type cells emitted a strong fluorescent
signal indicating the preferential nuclear location of dox.
in resistant u-2 os-r cells treated with dox and
observed by lscm under the same experimental conditions
as sensitive cells, the intensity of the fluorescent signal was
much lower, thus confirming the flow cytometric results, and
above all, showing a very different distribution (fig. 6d). in
fact, the nuclei of dox-treated resistant cells were negative;
the percentage of fluorescent spots detected in the cytoplasm
suggested the localization of the drug inside cytoplasmic
vesicles. remarkably, when treatment with dox was carried
out in the presence of  xxxd3523xxx  (fig. 6e), the intracellular
content and distribution of the fluorescent drug appeared to
be very similar to those observed in sensitive cells (fig. 6a).
an identical distribution was also observed in resistant cells
treated with dox in association with csa (fig. 6f).
enhancement of the cytotoxic effect of dox induced by
 xxxd3523xxx  on mdr cells. in order to verify whether the
effects of  xxxd3523xxx  might correspond to a real enhancement
of the cytotoxic activity of dox on resistant cells, the
survival of wild-type and mdr cells was evaluated after

treatment with  xxxd3523xxx  (1 |ig/ml) and dox (1.7 ug/ml),
given alone or in association.
as expected, the treatment with  xxxd3523xxx  alone did not
affect the survival of either of the wild-type cell lines whereas
the exposure to dox, alone or in association with  xxxd3523xxx ,
induced a strong cytotoxic effect and only a very low
percentage of sensitive cells maintained their viability (data
not shown). on the contrary, dox-treated resistant cells were
scarcely damaged by the drug given alone (cell survival >80%)
whereas a significant cytotoxic effect was revealed after
treatment with the combination of dox plus  xxxd3523xxx

(fig. 7). the cell survival of cem-r and u-2 os-r cells
was 50% and 20%, respectively.
sem observations confirmed the synergic effect of the
two compounds on resistant cells. both cem-r and u-2
os-r cells showed evident morphological changes after the
combined treatment. cem-r cells displayed altered shape
and loss of surface microvilli (fig. 8a) while resistant
osteosarcoma cells became rounder and detached from the
substratum (fig. 8b). when observed at higher magnification,
u2 os-r cells treated with dox plus  xxxd3523xxx  exhibited
a number of membrane blebs on their surface (fig. 8c). on
the contrary, after treatment with  xxxd3523xxx  or dox
administered alone, both the resistant cell lines appeared to
be very similar to the untreated control ones (fig. 2a and b).
discussion
the search for innovative and effective therapeutic
approaches, based on the use of new chemosensitizing
agents, possibly with a low degree of undesirable side effects
and in association with conventional cytotoxic drugs,
represents one of the main goals in anticancer therapy; in
particular against multidrug-resistant tumors. in this context,
a great number of natural substances of different origins and
chemical structure have been tested in vitro with the aim of
verifying their possible capability of reversing the resistant
phenotype of tumor cells.
in the present study, the chemosensitizing effect of the
bisindolic alkaloid  xxxd3523xxx  was investigated on cultured
multidrug-resistant cells exposed to dox. the cytotoxic
effect of  xxxd3523xxx  alone, or in combination with dox, was
evaluated on two different pairs of tumor cell lines: the
parental lymphoblastoid cell line cem-wt and its mdr
derivative cem-r selected by prolonged treatment with
vinblastine (r.i. = 269), the sensitive osteosarcoma cell line
u-2 os-wt and its derivative resistant u-2 os-r selected by
continuous exposure to dox (r.i. = 580). the results
obtained on both resistant cell types revealed a significant
increase of the cytotoxic effect of dox when administered to
resistant cells in combination with  xxxd3523xxx .
 xxxd3523xxx  is a typical bisindolic alkaloid of the ibogacorynane type first isolated in the voacanga species
(apocynaceae) (24) and found later in several species of the
subfamily tabernaemontanoideae. soon after its isolation it
was shown to possess remarkable cardiotonic activity with
much less toxicity than existing cardenolide-based drugs,
thus leading to its clinical use in heart failure treatment (25).
later it was reported to display a general cytotoxicity (26)
and strong anti-microbial activity against gram-positive
bacteria (13) and to be active in vitro against chloroquinesensitive and -resistant strains of p. falciparum (12). it was
also found to enhance the cytotoxic response mediated by
vinblastine in multidrug-resistant kb-v1 cells (11). it was
postulated that  xxxd3523xxx  might modulate the mdr
phenotype by inhibiting drug binding to hydrophobic
domains within the drug transporter p-glycoprotein molecule
(11). however, this explanation for observed mdr
reversion appears to be simplistic. it is well know that the
multidrug-resistance is a complex and multifactorial
phenomenon involving numerous cell functions and

structures, including various protein drug transporters. even
if the exact mechanism of  xxxd3523xxx  action at molecular
level is not yet known, the interaction with  xxxg10xxx  seems to
play a pivotal role in our cell models since the other two
protein transporters (mrp and lrp) did not show different
patterns of expression between sensitive and resistant cells.
indeed,  xxxd3523xxx  proved to strongly affect the dox
retention in resistant cells, in both uptake and efflux phases.
previous findings on mdr cell lines indicate that the
level of expression of  xxxg10xxx , one of the plasma membrane
proteins responsible for the active efflux of toxins out of
cells, was directly related to the degree of resistance (27).
several authors have also reported the presence of  xxxg10xxx  in
intracytoplasmic organelles, as golgi apparatus, of some
mdr cell lines deriving from histologically different tumors
such as leukemia and osteosarcoma (3,28,29). a close
relationship between changes in the intracellular drug
accumulation and the distribution and expression of different
drug transporters involved in drug-resistance has been
demonstrated previously (29,30-32).
dox accumulation and efflux studies were performed in
order to verify whether the functionality of  xxxg10xxx  expressed
on the surface of our resistant cell models was indeed
changed after treatment with  xxxd3523xxx . csa was also used
as a positive control because it was shown to be a competitive
inhibitor of  xxxg10xxx  (33,34).
as shown by the results of flow cytometric studies,
 xxxd3523xxx  was only able to increase drug accumulation and
retention in cem-r and u-2 os-r cells which expressed  xxxg10xxx 
and showed a high level of drug resistance. at the same time
the combination with csa revealed a similar effect, if more
intense. thus, the presence of  xxxg10xxx  in the resistant cell lines
could be the cause of different sequestration and redistribution
of dox inside the cytoplasm and/or nucleus.
a major role of  xxxd3523xxx  in regulating the intracellular
traffic of dox was also demonstrated by confocal microscopy
observations. in wild-type cells not expressing  xxxg10xxx , no
significant difference could be observed in the dox
distribution when the drug was administered alone or in
combination with  xxxd3523xxx  and the intense fluorescent
signal arised mainly from nuclei. conversely, in resistant
cells treated only with dox, the nuclei were negative
whereas, after the association with  xxxd3523xxx  or csa, the
dox molecules were able to reach the nuclei. since the main
intracellular target of the cytotoxic effect of dox is the
nuclear dna,  xxxd3523xxx  and csa seem to affect the drug
sensitivity of resistant cells by increasing the intracellular
drug concentration, both acting on the cellular drug transport
mechanisms. the enhancement of the cytotoxic effect of
dox induced by  xxxd3523xxx  on both the resistant cell lines
was further demonstrated by sem which showed evident
signs of cell damage after the combined treatment, whereas
the same cells exposed to dox or  xxxd3523xxx  alone appeared
to be very well preserved.
since  xxxd3523xxx  by itself with a concentration of 1 fxg/ml
did not exert any cytotoxic action, the significant cell death
observed in resistant lines after the combined treatment was
not due to the additive effects of the two compounds but
rather to some influence of  xxxd3523xxx  on the resistance
mechanisms to dox resulting in a synergic effect.

international journal of oncology 23: 1505-1513, 2003
in conclusion, the synergy provided by  xxxd3523xxx  on the
cytotoxic effect of dox seems to be well demonstrated, at
least in our in vitro experimental models. however, even if
 xxxg10xxx  appears to be strongly involved in such an effect, the
role of other interaction mechanisms cannot be ruled out. the
increase in drug retention, the change in intracellular drug
d i s t r i b u t i o n , the e n h a n c e m e n t of c y t o t o x i c i t y and the
morphological alterations induced in resistant cells by the
association of dox with  xxxd3523xxx , suggest promising
applications of this natural substance in anticancer therapy
particularly, against mdr tumors.
