1 the  xxxd2022xxx  drugs  xxxd2621xxx , ergotamine and dihydroergotamine (dhe) produce
selective vasoconstriction in the external carotid bed of vagosympathectomized dogs anaesthetized
with pentobarbital and arti®cially respired, but the receptors involved have not yet been completely
characterized. since the above drugs display anity for several binding sites, including aadrenoceptors and several 5-ht1 and  xxxg1113xxx  subtypes, this study has analysed the
mechanisms involved in the above responses.
2 intracarotid (i.c.) infusions during 1 min of  xxxd2621xxx  (31 ± 310 mg min71), ergotamine (0.56 ±
5.6 mg min71) or dhe (5.6 ± 31 mg min71) dose-dependently reduced external carotid blood ¯ow
(ecbf) by up to 46+4, 37+4 and 49+5%, respectively. blood pressure and heart rate remained
unchanged.
3 the reductions in ecbf by  xxxd2621xxx  were abolished and even reversed to increases in
animals pre-treated with gr127935 (10 mg kg71, i.v.).
4 the reductions in ecbf by ergotamine and dhe remained unchanged in animals pre-treated
(i.v.) with  xxxd3000xxx  (300 mg kg71), but were partly antagonized in animals pre-treated with either
gr127935 (10 or 30 mg kg71) or yohimbine (1000 mg kg71). pre-treatment with a combination of
gr127935 (30 mg kg71) and yohimbine (1000 mg kg71) abolished the responses to both ergotamine
and dhe. the above doses of antagonists were shown to produce selective antagonism at their
respective receptors.
5 these results suggest that the external carotid vasoconstrictor responses to  xxxd2621xxx 
primarily involve 5-ht1b/1d receptors, whereas those to ergotamine and dhe are mediated by 5ht1b/1d receptors as well as a2-adrenoceptors.

introduction
several lines of pharmacological evidence show that serotonin
(5-hydroxytryptamine; 5-ht) and the  xxxd2022xxx  drug
sumatriptan constrict the carotid vascular bed in vagosympathectomized animals via 5-ht1-like receptors (den boer et
al., 1991b; villaloân et al., 1995). using the potent and selective
5-ht1b/1d receptor antagonist, gr127935 (n-[4-methoxy-3(4-methyl-1-piperazinyl)phenyl]-2'-methyl-4' (5-methyl-1, 2,4oxadiazol-3-yl) [1,1,-biphenyl]-4-carboxamide hydrochloride
monohydrate) (see pauwels, 1996; skingle et al., 1996), it was
subsequently demonstrated that these vasoconstrictor 5-ht1like receptors correspond to 5-ht1b/1d subtypes (de vries et
al., 1996; villaloân et al., 1996). additionally, it has been
previously demonstrated that the classical  xxxd2022xxx  agents
 xxxd2621xxx , ergotamine and dihydroergotamine (dhe) exert
a selective vasoconstrictor action in the carotid vascular bed of
several species, including dogs (saxena, 1974b; saxena et al.,
1983), pigs (saxena & verdouw, 1984; den boer et al., 1991a),

cats (spierings & saxena, 1980) and monkeys (mylecharane et
al., 1978).
surprisingly, very little is known about the receptor
mechanisms involved in the external carotid vasoconstriction
induced by  xxxd2621xxx , ergotamine and dhe in the dog. in
this respect, we have shown that vasoconstriction in the canine
external carotid bed may be mediated by activation of 5-ht1b/
1d receptors (villaloân et al., 1996), a1- and a2-adrenoceptors
(villaloân & terroân, 1994; terroân et al., 1996), but not by 5ht2 (villaloân et al., 1995) or d2 receptors (villaloân & terroân,
1994). indeed, as shown in table 1, ergotamine and dhe are
able to interact with a wide variety of receptors mediating
vasoconstriction, including 5-ht1/2 receptors and a1/2-adrenoceptors, whereas  xxxd2621xxx  seems to interact mainly with 5ht1/2 receptors. in the light of these ®ndings, the present study
set out to characterize the pharmacological pro®le of the
receptors involved in the vasoconstriction of the canine
external carotid vascular bed in response to  xxxd2621xxx ,
ergotamine and dhe, with particular emphasis on verifying
the possible involvement of the 5-ht1b/1d receptor subtypes
and a1- and a2-adrenoceptors. for this purpose, we made use
of antagonists at 5-ht1b/1d receptor subtypes (gr127935;

adrenoceptors (homan & lefkowitz, 1996), after determining the doses of these antagonists that produce selective
blockade at their respective receptors. preliminary results of
this investigation have been communicated to the xiiith
international congress of pharmacology (villaloân et al., 1998).

methods

vasodilatation (saxena & de vlaam-schluter, 1974). the
agonists were administered into the carotid artery by a
harvard model 901 pump (harvard apparatus co. inc.,
millis, ma, u.s.a.) with a catheter inserted into the right
cranial thyroid artery. blood pressure, heart rate and external
carotid blood ¯ow were recorded simultaneously by a model
7d polygraph (grass instrument co., quincy, ma, u.s.a.).
the body temperature of the animals was maintained between
37 ± 388c.

general

experimental protocol

experiments were carried out in a total of 72 dogs (15 ± 31 kg)
not selected for breed or sex. the animals were anaesthetized
with an intravenous (i.v.) bolus injection of sodium
pentobarbitone (30 mg kg71) and additional amounts
(1 mg kg71, i.v.) were provided when required. all dogs were
intubated with an endotracheal tube and arti®cially respired
with room air; for this purpose, a palmer ventilation pump was
used at a rate of 20 strokes min71 and a stroke volume of 13 ±
16 ml kg71, as previously established by kleinman & radford
(1964). catheters were placed in the inferior vena cava via a
femoral vein for the administration of antagonist drugs and in
the aortic arch via a femoral artery, connected to a statham
pressure transducer (p23 id), for the measurement of blood
pressure. after drug administration, the venous catheter was
¯ushed with 3 ml of saline. mean blood pressure (map) was
calculated from the systolic (sap) and diastolic (dap) arterial
pressures: map=dap+(sap-dap)/3. heart rate was
measured with a tachograph (7p4f, grass instrument co.,
quincy, ma, u.s.a.) triggered from the blood pressure signal.
the right common carotid artery was dissected free and the
corresponding internal carotid and occipital arteries were
ligated. thereafter, an ultrasonic ¯ow probe (4 mm r-series)
connected to an ultrasonic t201d ¯owmeter (transonic
systems inc., ithaca, n.y., u.s.a.) was placed around the
right common carotid artery, and the ¯ow through this artery
was considered as the external carotid blood ¯ow (for further
details, see villaloân et al., 1993). bilateral cervical vagosympathectomy was systematically performed in order to produce
one of the main features of migraine, i.e. external carotid

after a stable haemodynamic condition for at least 30 min,
baseline values of blood pressure, heart rate and external
carotid blood ¯ow were determined. at this point, the dogs
were divided into two groups (n=56 and 16, respectively). the
®rst group (n=56) was subdivided into three subgroups. in the
®rst subgroup (n=8), the eects of sequential 1 min
intracarotid (i.c.) infusions of  xxxd2621xxx  (31, 100 and
310 mg min71) were analysed in animals pre-treated i.v. with
either saline (0.1 ml kg71, n=4) or gr127935 (10 mg kg71;
n=4). in the second and third subgroups (n=24 each), the
eects of cumulative 1 min i.c. infusions of ergotamine (0.56,
1, 1.8, 3.1 and 5.6 mg min71) or dhe (5.6, 10, 18 and
31 mg min71), respectively, were analysed in animals pretreated with i.v. infusions of either (n=4 each) saline
(0.1 ml kg71),
gr127935
(10 mg kg71),
gr127935
(30 mg kg71),
 xxxd3000xxx 
(300 mg kg71),
yohimbine
(1000 mg kg71) or the combination of gr127935 (30 mg kg71)
and yohimbine (1000 mg kg71). in the second group (n=16),
all animals received subsequent 1 min i.c. infusions of
clonidine (1 mg min71), phenylephrine (10 mg min71) and
sumatriptan (30 mg min71). then, this group of animals was
subdivided into four subgroups (n=4 each). in these
subgroups, the responses to clonidine, phenylephrine and
sumatriptan were reanalysed after i.v. administration of either
 xxxd3000xxx  (300 mg kg71), yohimbine (1000 mg kg71), gr127935
(30 mg kg71) or the combination of gr127935 (30 mg kg71)
and yohimbine (1000 mg kg71).
the dose-intervals between the dierent doses of  xxxd2621xxx  ranged between 5 and 10 min, as in each case we waited

until the blood ¯ow had returned completely to baseline
values. moreover, after the administration of an antagonist or
saline a period of about 10 min was allowed to elapse before
the responses to the respective agonists were elicited.

data presentation and statistical analysis
all data have been expressed as the means+s.e.mean. the
peak changes in external carotid blood ¯ow (calculated as
percent change from baseline) by  xxxd2621xxx , ergotamine
and dhe after pre-treatment with a dose of a particular
antagonist were compared to the respective responses by these
agonists in saline-pre-treated animals by student's unpaired ttest. furthermore, the peak percent changes in external carotid
blood ¯ow by clonidine, phenylephrine and sumatriptan
before and after antagonist treatment were compared by using
student-newman-keuls test, once an analysis of variance
(randomized block design) had revealed that the samples
represented dierent populations (steel & torrie, 1980).
statistical signi®cance was accepted at p50.05 (two-tailed).

drugs
apart from the anaesthetic (sodium pentobarbitone), the drugs
used in the present study (obtained from the sources indicated)
were the following: phenylephrine hydrochloride, clonidine
hydrochloride and  xxxd3000xxx  hydrochloride (sigma chemical
company, st. louis, mo, u.s.a.); gr127935 and  xxxd3263xxx  (gifts from dr m. skingle, glaxo group
research, ware, herts, u.k. and dr h.e. connor, glaxo
group research, stevenage, hertfordshire, u.k. respectively);
 xxxd2621xxx  maleate, dhe mesylate and  xxxd2022xxx 
(gift: sandoz a.g., basel, switzerland). all compounds were
dissolved in physiological saline. when needed, 5% (vv71)
 xxxd3034xxx  ( xxxd3000xxx ) was added; this vehicle had no
eect on the haemodynamic variables. gr127935 was
solubilized according to the instructions of the supplier by
heating the dispersion in bidistilled water to about 708c for
10 s and then allowing to cool down to room temperature. all
doses of antagonists refer to the respective salts, whereas those
of the agonists refer to the free base.

results
systemic haemodynamic variables
baseline values of mean arterial blood pressure, heart rate and
external carotid blood ¯ow in the 72 vagosympathectomized
dogs were, respectively, 142+5 mmhg, 178+8 beats min71
and 163+21 ml min71. no signi®cant dierences were
observed in the initial values between the 18 subgroups. as

depicted in table 2, these haemodynamic variables remained
essentially unchanged after i.v. administrations of saline,
gr127935, yohimbine, or the combination of gr127935 and
yohimbine, at all doses tested. only  xxxd3000xxx  produced a
signi®cant decrease in both mean blood pressure and external
carotid blood ¯ow by 29+15 and 29+16%, respectively,
without aecting the corresponding carotid vascular conductance (not shown). this  xxxd3000xxx -induced hypotension and
the resulting decrease in external carotid blood ¯ow has
previously been reported to be attributable to its a1adrenoceptor blocking properties (terroân et al, 1996). in any
case, these eects were not accompanied by changes in heart
rate (table 2), as previously shown by massingham & hayden
(1975).

initial eects of  xxxd2621xxx , ergotamine and dhe on
external carotid blood ¯ow
as shown in figure 1, i.c. infusions (during 1 min) of
 xxxd2621xxx  (31, 100 and 310 mg min71), ergotamine (0.56,
1, 1.8, 3.1 and 5.6 mg min71) and dhe (5.6, 10, 18 and
31 mg min71) produced dose-dependent decreases in external
carotid blood ¯ow, without changes in mean blood pressure or
heart rate (not shown). the above responses, which were
immediate in onset, are drug-induced as 1 min i.c. infusions of
the corresponding volumes of saline did not aect any
haemodynamic parameter for the duration of the experiments
(data not shown). the duration of action of ergotamine and
dhe could not be established, as external carotid blood ¯ow
did not return to baseline values, as previously reported
(saxena, 1974a; villaloân et al., 1992). in contrast, the duration
of action of  xxxd2621xxx  was 2.0+0.7, 7.0+1.2 and
9.0+1.9 min after 31, 100 and 310 mg min71, respectively.
the apparent rank order of potency obtained in the present
experiments was ergotamine4dhe4methysergide (figure 1).

external carotid vasoconstriction
as depicted in figure 2, in animals pre-treated with 10 mg kg71
of gr127935, the decreases in external carotid blood ¯ow by
 xxxd2621xxx  were abolished and even reversed to an external
carotid vasodilatation.

external carotid blood ¯ow in vagosympathectomized dogs. all
values have been presented as means+s.e.mean.

ingly, a higher dose of gr127935 (30 mg kg71) did not
produce a further blockade. moreover, whereas  xxxd3000xxx 
(300 mg kg71) did not aect the ergotamine- and dheinduced decreases in external carotid blood ¯ow, yohimbine
(1000 mg kg71) brought about a partial blockade. signi®cantly, the combination of gr127935 (30 mg kg71) and
yohimbine (1000 mg kg71) completely blocked the external
carotid vasoconstriction induced by ergotamine (figure 3) and
dhe (figure 4). the above doses of antagonists, as explained
below, were shown to produce selective antagonism at their
respective receptors.

combination of gr127935 and yohimbine on the external
carotid vasoconstriction produced by clonidine,
phenylephrine and sumatriptan
as depicted in figure 5, gr127935 (30 mg kg71) selectively
antagonized the external carotid vasoconstriction to sumatriptan, as the responses to clonidine and phenylephrine
remained unaected. similarly,  xxxd3000xxx  (300 mg kg71) exclusively abolished the phenylephrine-induced decreases in
external carotid blood ¯ow, leaving the clonidine- and
sumatriptan-induced changes intact. lastly, while yohimbine
(1000 mg kg71) abolished only the clonidine-induced carotid
vascular eects, the combination of gr127935 (30 mg kg71)
and yohimbine (1000 mg kg71) completely blocked the
clonidine-, as well as the sumatriptan-induced constriction of
the canine carotid vascular bed. it should be pointed out that
the external carotid vasoconstrictor responses to phenylephrine, clonidine and sumatriptan are highly reproducible, as

they remained essentially unchanged in control animals
receiving two subsequent bolus injections of physiological
saline (villaloân & terroân, 1994; villaloân et al, 1996).

discussion
general
the major ®ndings of the present study in vagosympathectomized dogs were that: (i) the  xxxd2621xxx -induced external
carotid vasoconstriction was abolished, and even reversed to
carotid vasodilatation, by the selective 5-ht1b/1d receptor
antagonist, gr127935 and (ii) the external carotid vasoconstrictor responses by ergotamine and dhe were only partly
antagonized by gr127935 or yohimbine, but were completely
blocked by the combination of gr127935 and yohimbine.
apart from the implications discussed below, these data
indicate that the vasoconstrictor responses to ergotamine
and dhe in the external carotid vascular bed involve both
5-ht1b/1d receptors and a2-adrenoceptors, whereas  xxxd2621xxx  seems to exert external carotid vasoconstriction primarily
via 5-ht1b/1d receptors.

al., 1996), 1 min i.c. infusions of  xxxd2621xxx  dosedependently decreased external carotid blood ¯ow, an eect
which has been suggested to be due to an agonist action of the
ergot derivative at smooth muscle 5-ht1-like receptors
(saxena & verdouw, 1984; martin, 1994). as  xxxd2621xxx 
did not aect heart rate or blood pressure, these data suggest
that under our experimental conditions  xxxd2621xxx  induced
a selective vasoconstriction in the external carotid circulation.
a complete blockade of the  xxxd2621xxx -induced carotid
vasoconstriction was observed after treatment with 10 mg kg71
of gr127935; this dose of gr127935 has previously been
shown to abolish sumatriptan-induced external carotid
vasoconstriction without aecting that to noradrenaline or
oxymetazoline (villaloân et al., 1996). in the present study, our
results further demonstrate that doses of gr127935 up to
30 mg kg71 selectively abolish sumatriptan-induced canine
external carotid vasoconstriction, since the corresponding
responses to phenylephrine and clonidine remained unaltered
(figure 5), as expected from its binding pro®le (see table 1).
thus, these data show that  xxxd2621xxx  constricts the external

carotid vasculature predominantly via the 5-ht1b/1d receptor
subtypes, at which  xxxd2621xxx  displays high anities (see
table 1). in view of the complete blockade by gr127935, as
well as the low anities exhibited by  xxxd2621xxx  at a1- and
a2-adrenoceptors (see table 1), we decided not to further
analyse the eects of prozosin or yohimbine on the
 xxxd2621xxx -induced external carotid vasoconstriction.

contribution of 5-ht1b/1d receptors in the carotid
vasoconstrictor responses to ergotamine and dhe
one minute i.c. infusions of ergotamine and dhe induced
dose-dependent decreases in the external carotid blood ¯ow,
without aecting heart rate or mean arterial blood pressure.
thus, these ®ndings suggest that such responses were caused
by a selective constriction in the external carotid vascular bed.
notwithstanding, unlike  xxxd2621xxx , the responses to
ergotamine and dhe were of long duration, as previously
observed in vivo (saxena, 1974a; den boer et al., 1991a;
villaloân et al., 1992; de vries et al., 1998b) and in vitro
(muèller-schweinitzer & weidmann, 1978; maassenvandenbrink et al., 1998). although there is no clear-cut explanation
for this dierence, it has been suggested, albeit not
categorically proven, that it may be due to a slow dissociation

from its receptors or a sequestration and subsequent diusion
out of a local nonsaturable compartment (muèller-schweinitzer
& weidmann, 1978; martin et al., 1995).
regarding the possible receptor mechanisms involved in the
vasoconstrictor responses to ergotamine and dhe, previous
results in anaesthetized dogs have shown that the external
carotid vasoconstrictor responses to ergotamine and dhe are
not mediated by 5-ht2 receptors, whereas only part of the
eects seem to be mediated by  xxxd2914xxx -sensitive aadrenoceptors (saxena et al., 1983). moreover, 5-ht1-like
receptors are only partly involved in the ergotamine- and
dhe-induced constriction of the carotid vasculature in pigs
(den boer et al., 1991a). since 5-ht1-like receptors mediating
porcine as well as canine carotid vasoconstriction are similar to
the 5-ht1b/1d receptor subtypes (de vries et al., 1996; villaloân
et al., 1996; saxena et al., 1998), we decided to explore the
possible involvement of 5-ht1b/1d receptors in the present
study. indeed, the responses to ergotamine and dhe in dogs
were, in contrast to the  xxxd2621xxx - and sumatriptaninduced eects, only partly antagonized by 10 mg kg71 of
gr127935; the fact that pre-treatment with a higher dose of
gr127935 did not produce any further blockade, implies that
the ergotamine- and dhe-induced external carotid vasoconstriction involves a mixed population of receptors. thus, we

suggest that the responses to ergotamine and dhe are partly
mediated via 5-ht1b/1d receptors, but a considerable part is
mediated via gr127935-resistant receptors. consistent with
these ®ndings, we have recently shown that ergotamine and
dhe act, at least partly, via gr127935-sensitive 5-ht1b/1d
receptors in the porcine carotid vascular bed, but additional
receptors/mechanisms seem to be involved (de vries et al.,
1998b).

contribution of a1- and/or a2-adrenoceptors in the
carotid vasoconstrictor responses to ergotamine and
dhe
as discussed above, a considerable part of the external carotid
vasoconstriction by both ergotamine and dhe is mediated by
non-5-ht1b/1d receptors. these gr127935-resistant receptors
may be of the a-adrenoceptor class, as (i) agonists at a1- and a2adrenoceptors can produce potent vasoconstrictor responses in
the carotid circulation of dogs (villaloân & terroân, 1994;
terroân et al., 1996) and pigs (willems, e.w., personal
communication); and (ii) ergotamine and dhe display high
anities at a1- and a2-adrenoceptors (table 1).
nevertheless, 300 mg kg71 of  xxxd3000xxx , a dose which is 3
fold higher than that required to abolish  xxxd2601xxx -

induced canine external carotid vasoconstriction (terroân et al.,
1996), did not aect the vasoconstrictor responses to either
ergotamine (figure 3) or dhe (figure 4). these results suggest
that ergotamine and dhe do not display a1-adrenoceptor
agonist properties under our experimental conditions. indeed,
this suggestion is strengthened by our results showing that the
above dose of  xxxd3000xxx  produced a selective and complete
blockade of the a1-adrenoceptor-mediated external carotid
vasoconstriction induced by phenylephrine (figure 5). it might
still be argued that ergotamine and dhe could have behaved
as a-adrenoceptor antagonists. nonetheless, at such low total
doses (5.6 and 31 mg for ergotamine and dhe, respectively)
these ergot derivatives did not modify the external carotid
vasoconstrictor responses to phenylephrine and clonidine
(data not shown).
contrasting with  xxxd3000xxx , yohimbine was capable of
producing a partial blockade of the vasoconstrictor responses
to ergotamine and dhe (see figures 3 and 4) at a dose
(1000 mg kg71) that selectively abolished clonidine-induced
canine external carotid vasoconstriction (figure 5). taken
together, the above results imply that a2-, but not a1adrenoceptors, are involved, as previously suggested by other
studies (muèller-schweinitzer & weidmann, 1978; kalkman,
1983; muèller-schweinitzer, 1984).

nevertheless, it must be recognized that yohimbine also
displays moderate anity for other receptors, including a1adrenoceptors and 5-ht1b/1d receptors (see table 1); thus, it is
reasonable to assume that the above dose of the drug could
have been high enough to block these, and other, receptors.
yet, lower doses of yohimbine (100 and 300 mg kg71, i.v.) did
not completely block clonidine-induced external carotid
vasoconstriction and higher doses (3000 mg kg71, i.v.) were
not selective in our model as they also blocked phenylephrineinduced external carotid vasoconstriction (data not shown).
indeed, other in vivo studies have shown that yohimbine
displays moderate selectivity for a2- over the a1-adrenoceptor
in anaesthetized cats (ramage & tomlinson, 1985) and dogs
(shepperson et al., 1981).
however, as shown in figure 5, the antagonism produced
by 1000 mg kg71 of yohimbine at external carotid a2-receptors
was selective, since this dose completely blocked the clonidineinduced carotid vascular eects without aecting those to
sumatriptan (mediated by 5-ht1b/1d receptors; villaloân et al.,
1996) and phenylephrine (mediated by a1-adrenoceptors;
villaloân & terroân, 1994). in any case, the latter suggestion is
validated by the fact that  xxxd3000xxx , at doses producing selective
a1-adrenoceptor antagonism did not aect the responses to
ergotamine and dhe. although beyond the scope of the

592

c.m. villaloâ n et al

present investigation, further studies using highly selective
agonists and antagonists will be required to ascertain which
speci®c subtype(s) of the a2-adrenoceptor is (are) producing
vasoconstriction.

possible involvement of other receptors in the carotid
vasoconstrictor responses to ergotamine and dhe
as discussed above, the constriction of the canine carotid
vascular bed by ergotamine and dhe is likely to be mediated
by 5-ht1b/1d receptors, as well as a2-adrenoceptors. the
question remains open, however, whether additional receptors
and/or mechanisms play a role in their eects. for this reason
we studied the eects of a combination of gr127935 and
yohimbine on the carotid vascular responses by the ergot
alkaloids. indeed, after simultaneous, selective blockade of
both 5-ht1b/1d receptors and a2-adrenoceptors, the carotid
vascular eects of ergotamine and dhe are abolished.
therefore, the above results, taken collectively, suggest that
the vasoconstriction of the carotid vascular bed induced by
ergotamine and dhe in vagosympathectomized dogs is
primarily mediated by both 5-ht1b/1d receptors and a2adrenoceptors.
on the other hand, since  xxxd2621xxx , ergotamine and
dhe (as well as gr127935 and yohimbine) display also
moderate anity for  xxxg1112xxx  receptors (see table 1), its
potential role cannot be categorically excluded in the present
study, particularly when considering that mrna for  xxxg1112xxx 
receptors has been shown in cranial blood vessels (bouchelet et
al., 1996). indeed, sumatriptan, which displays reasonable
anity (pki: 7.64) for the recombinant  xxxg1112xxx  (adham
et al., 1993), also produced a gr127935-sensitive vasoconstriction in the canine external carotid bed (villaloân et al., 1996).
notwithstanding, two recent ®ndings from our laboratory
apparently argue against the role of  xxxg1112xxx  receptors (and
simultaneously reinforce the role of 5-ht1b receptors): (i)
1 min i.c. infusions of ly344864 (1 ± 3100 mg min71), a
selective  xxxg1112xxx  agonist (phebus et al., 1997), did
not produce canine external carotid vasoconstriction (unpublished); and (ii) sb224289 (300 mg kg71), a selective 5-ht1b
ligand with very low anity (pki: 55.0) for  xxxg1112xxx  receptors
(hagan et al., 1997), completely blocked 5-ht- as well as
sumatriptan-induced canine external carotid vasoconstriction
(de vries et al., 1998a).

possible involvement of external carotid vasodilator
mechanisms by ergot derivatives
interestingly, after treatment with gr127935, not only was the
 xxxd2621xxx -induced carotid constriction abolished, but a
clear vasodilator response was unmasked. we have previously
demonstrated that the 5-ht-induced external carotid vasodilatation in gr127935-pretreated vagosympathectomized dogs
is mediated via 5-ht7 receptors (villaloân et al., 1997a), as
shown in other vascular preparations (saxena et al., 1998).
therefore, it is tempting to suggest that  xxxd2621xxx  could
have acted via smooth muscle relaxant 5-ht7 receptors, for
which the compound displays high anity (see table 1).

carotid vascular effects of ergot derivatives

nevertheless, this seems less likely, as  xxxd2621xxx  behaves as
a silent antagonist at other cardiovascular 5-ht7 receptors,
including those mediating feline tachycardia (villaloân et al.,
1997b) and rat hypotension (saxena & lawang, 1985).
alternatively,  xxxd2621xxx  may have stimulated an endothelial receptor resulting in the release of  xxxd2738xxx , possibly of
the  xxxg1114xxx  subtype, as shown previously for other
ergot derivatives in the porcine pulmonary circulation (glusa
& roos, 1996). in support of this contention, the  xxxd2621xxx -induced carotid dilatory response was inhibited in animals
treated with the  xxxd2738xxx  synthetase inhibitor l-ngnitroarginine methyl ester (l-name; unpublished observations).
as opposed to  xxxd2621xxx , ergotamine and dhe did not
induce any vasodilator eects in the external carotid
circulation, even after complete blockade of the vasoconstrictor eects by gr127935 and yohimbine. this seems to argue
the possible involvement of endothelial dilatory (5-ht)
receptors, as these ergot derivatives have been shown to be
potent agonists at the (5-ht2b) receptors mediating endothelium-dependent vasorelaxation of porcine isolated pulmonary
arteries (glusa & roos, 1996). it should be noted, however,
that yohimbine has been shown to possess high antagonist
anity at 5-ht2b receptors (table 1) and, therefore, may have
inhibited the potential ergot-induced vasorelaxant eects at
these receptors. in this context, in view of the low anity
displayed by yohimbine at 5-ht7 receptors (table 1), it is
highly unlikely that 5-ht7 receptors mediate the potential
ergotamine- and dhe-induced external carotid vasodilatation.
in conclusion, our results show that in vagosympathectomized, anaesthetized dogs,  xxxd2621xxx  constricts the external
carotid vascular bed predominantly via gr127935-sensitive 5ht1b/1d receptors. after administration of gr127935, an
external carotid vasodilator (possibly endothelial) component
was unmasked. additionally, the present results show the
predominant involvement of both 5-ht1b/1d receptors and a2adrenoceptors, but not a1-adrenoceptors, in the external
carotid constriction by ergotamine and dhe. the therapeutic
ecacy of these classical  xxxd2022xxx  drugs is likely to be
mediated by these receptors, as constriction of the carotid
vascular bed is highly predictive of  xxxd2022xxx  potential
(saxena et al., 1997). in this context, we have clearly
demonstrated that the decrease in carotid blood ¯ow by
 xxxd2022xxx  agents is exclusively due to vasoconstriction of
carotid arteriovenous anastomoses (for references see saxena,
1995; saxena et al., 1997), which have been suggested to be in a
dilated state during migraine headaches (e.g. heyck, 1969;
saxena, 1995). lastly, although we cannot categorically
exclude other, possibly novel receptors/mechanisms, as shown
recently in the porcine carotid vasculature (de vries et al.,
1998b), it seems that, if present at all, these are of minor
importance in the dog external carotid vascular bed.
