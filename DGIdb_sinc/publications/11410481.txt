abstract
purpose:  xxxd2190xxx  ( xxxd2190xxx ; wyeth
laboratories, philadelphia, pa) consists of a semisynthetic
derivative of calicheamicin, a cytotoxic antibiotic linked to a
recombinant monoclonal antibody directed against the
 xxxg382xxx  antigen present on leukemic myeloblasts in most patients with acute myeloid leukemia (aml). in this study, we
review the preclinical and clinical profiles of this immunoconjugate and the regulatory review that led to marketing
approval by the united states food and drug administration.
experimental design: from the literature and manufacturer’s data, we review the activity, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of  xxxd2190xxx  in preclinical and
phase i studies and its activity, efficacy, and side effects in
three phase 2 trials of 142 patients with relapsed aml.
results: in phase i studies, the major toxicity was myelosuppression, especially neutropenia and thrombocytopenia, resulting from the expression of  xxxg382xxx  on myeloid progenitor cells. the phase 2 dose was 9 mg/m2 infused i.v. over
4 h, repeated on day 14. a minority of patients experienced
acute infusion-related symptoms, usually transient and occasionally requiring hospitalization. the complete response
(cr) rate with full recovery of hematopoiesis was 16%. a
subset of patients [crs with incomplete platelet recovery
(crps)] was identified with blast clearance and neutrophil
recovery but incomplete platelet recovery. the duration of
responses of crps appeared to be similar to those of the
crs, although the numbers were small. the question of the
equivalence of these response groups was a central issue in
the review of this new drug application (nda). after considerable discussion, the oncology drugs advisory committee recommended allowing inclusion of crps resulting in an
overall response rate in the phase 2 studies of 30%. in the

subgroup of patients over 60 years of age, the overall response rate was 26%. response duration was difficult to
establish because of the high prevalence of postremission
therapies. tolerability and ease of administration may be
improved compared with conventional chemotherapy, except for hepatotoxicity, with 31% of patients exhibiting
abnormal liver enzymes. one patient died of liver failure in
the phase 2 trials.
conclusions: marketing approval of  xxxd2190xxx  was granted on may 17, 2000 by the united states
food and drug administration under the accelerated approval regulations.  xxxd2190xxx  is indicated
for the treatment of patients with  xxxg382xxx  positive aml in
first relapse who are 60 years of age or older and who are
not considered candidates for cytotoxic chemotherapy. the
approved dose was 9 mg/m2 i.v. over 4 h and repeated in 14
days. completion of the ongoing studies of gemtuzumab
ozogamicin in relapsed aml and initiation of randomized
clinical trials comparing the effects of  xxxd2190xxx  in combination with conventional induction chemotherapy to conventional chemotherapy alone on survival are
mandated to confirm clinical benefit under the accelerated
approval subpart h regulations. postmarketing reports of
fatal anaphylaxis, adult respiratory distress syndrome
(ards), and hepatotoxicity, especially venoocclusive disease
(vod) in patients treated with  xxxd2190xxx ,
with and without associated hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (hsct), have required labeling revisions and the
initiation of a registration surveillance program. tumor
lysis and ards have been reported in patients with leukocytes above 30,000/ml treated with  xxxd2190xxx ; therefore, the reduction of leukocyte counts to below
30,000/ml is recommended prior to treatment. patients
should be carefully monitored for acute hypersensitivity,
hypoxia, and delayed hepatotoxicity following treatment
with  xxxd2190xxx .

introduction
 xxxg1997xxx  is a disease characterized by the proliferation of
clonal precursor myeloid cells with arrested differentiation.
aml affects approximately 9000 people/year in the united
states with a peak incidence in people 60 –70 years of age.
conventional treatment with a combination of cytotoxic chemotherapeutic agents results in remission rates of up to 85%;
however, many of these patients eventually relapse (1). treatment of relapsed aml patients is considerably less successful,

is linked to the antibody in variable molar ratios; approximately 50% of
the antibody is unconjugated.

especially in the elderly. remission rates are generally reported
to be 20 – 40% in patients over 65 years of age, compared with
40 –50% in younger patients (2). treatment of aml in the
elderly has been particularly problematic, because the toxicity of
standard induction chemotherapy is poorly tolerated in the older
age group (3).
aml myeloblasts are immunophenotypically well characterized and accessible to circulating antibodies (4).  xxxg382xxx  is a mr
67,000 transmembrane cell surface glycoprotein receptor that is
specific for myeloid cells.  xxxg382xxx  expression is down-regulated
with maturation of the myeloid lineage, resulting in low-level
expression on peripheral granulocytes and tissue macrophages
(5). the  xxxg382xxx  antigen is expressed on approximately 90% of
aml myeloblasts, including leukemic clonogenic precursors as
well as normal myeloid precursor cells, but not on cd34⫹
pluripotent hematopoietic stem cells (6). in vitro studies have
documented internalization of  xxxg382xxx  antibodies by the target
cell (7). these properties enable the use of antibodies directed
against  xxxg382xxx  in the treatment of myeloid leukemia (8).
several approaches using antibodies to  xxxg382xxx  in the treatment of myeloid leukemia have been attempted, including the
use of unconjugated so called “naked” antibodies, radioimmunoconjugates, and immunotoxin conjugates (9). the most clinically successful approach thus far has been with the antibodydirected cytotoxic agent  xxxd2190xxx . this is a
humanized anti- xxxg382xxx  monoclonal antibody produced from a
mammalian myeloma cell culture cell line covalently linked to
a semisynthetic derivative of calicheamicin (fig. 1). calicheamicin ␥li is a potent cytotoxic enediyene antibiotic, originally isolated from micromonospora echinospora ssp. calichensis. this antibiotic is believed to be released inside the
lysosomes of the myeloblast, binding to dna in the minor
groove and causing dna double-strand breaks and ultimately
cell death (10). about 50% of the antibody is linked to calicheamicin with an average loading of four to six molecules of
calicheamicin/antibody. the remaining antibody is unconjugated.

preclinical evaluation.  xxxd2190xxx  showed
in vitro activity against the  xxxg382xxx -positive ( xxxg382xxx ⫹) hl-60
human  xxxg1785xxx  cell line and demonstrated selectivity for  xxxg382xxx ⫹ target cells relative to cells not expressing
the  xxxg382xxx  antigen, thus causing significant reduction in growth
in the hl-60 xenograft tumor model. when administered
weekly for six doses,  xxxd2190xxx  was not lethal to
rats up to 7.2 mg/m2 and in monkeys up to 22 mg/m2. marked
changes in the histopathology of the testes, liver, and kidney
were noted at these doses, as well as significant myelotoxicity.
free calicheamicin, as well as conjugated calicheamicin, was
noted to cause liver toxicity in preclinical testing, and  xxxd2190xxx  was found to be preferentially distributed to
the liver.
pharmacokinetic studies were conducted in rats and monkeys after administration of single and repeated i.v. doses of
 xxxd2190xxx . the major excretion pathways appeared to be biliary, and plasma concentrations of the unconjugated calicheamicin derivatives were generally below the assay
limits. reproductive toxicology suggests the potential for adverse human effects on fertility, dysmorphogenesis, and fetal
growth.  xxxd2190xxx  was clastogenic in an in vivo
mouse micronucleus assay, as expected from the induction of
dna damage by calicheamicin.
phase i trials. a single phase i trial evaluated the dose
range, safety, and pharmacokinetics of  xxxd2190xxx 
in men and women 16 to 70 years of age with  xxxg382xxx  positive
aml who had failed to achieve remission or had a relapse after
remission. a dosing interval of 2 weeks was selected because of
the relatively long half-life of the drug (over 3 days; see “pharmacokinetics” section). initially, three biweekly doses were
studied, but this led to profound and persistent myelosuppression. subsequently, two doses were used in the phase 2 trials,
and the dose was not adjusted for high blast counts. the doselimiting toxicity was neutropenia, and persistent thrombocytopenia occurred in half of the patients. the most common acute
infusion-related clinical adverse event was a postinfusion symptom complex consisting of fever and chills. this symptom
complex generally occurred within 6 h after infusion and tended
to be less frequent and severe with subsequent doses. the most
common delayed infusion-related events overall in dose periods
were fever (44% of patients), nausea (32%), chills (27%), leukopenia (22%), vomiting (12%), rash (12%), and pain (10%).
activity. two of the 41 patients treated in the phase i
trials experienced objective crs after three doses of  xxxd2190xxx , one treated at 1 mg/m2 and one at 4 mg/m2.
seven additional patients treated with doses of 5, 6, and 9
mg/m2 had clearance of leukemic blasts (⬍5%) from their blood
and bone marrow but without full recovery of peripheral leukocyte or platelet counts. the phenomenon of postremission
thrombocytopenia after myeloablative chemotherapy with or
without hsct has been described previously (11). persistent
thrombocytopenia could not be ascribed to binding of
megakaryocytes by  xxxd2190xxx , because  xxxg382xxx  is
found on less than 20% of megakaryocytes (12). studies of the
toxicity of  xxxd2190xxx  on normal human bone
marrow samples revealed variable suppression of megakaryocyte colony formation in different samples.

included the absence of peripheral blasts, ⬍5% residual marrow
blasts, an absolute neutrophil count of at least 1500/␮l, and
achievement of platelet counts above 100,000/␮l. a 1990 ncisponsored workshop on definitions of diagnosis and response in
aml concluded that patients with prolonged cytopenias but no
marrow evidence of leukemia should be described separately
and “not considered to be nonresponders” (13). the identification of patients with apparent blast clearance but persistent
thrombocytopenia in the phase i study led to the proposal of a
new category of responses termed “crps,” with clearance of
blasts but incomplete platelet recovery. the combination of crs
and crps, termed “overall responders” (ors) was a secondary
end point of the phase 2 trials, whereas cr remained the
primary end point.
pharmacokinetics. in vitro metabolism studies performed indicate that numerous metabolites of  xxxd2190xxx  are formed. the biotransformation pathways identified
in liver microsomes were oxygenation and demethylation,
whereas the acetylation of calicheamicin and its derivatives are
the major pathways in cytosol. animal studies indicate that
 xxxd2190xxx  undergoes hepatobiliary elimination;
however, the route of elimination has not been studied in humans. the pharmacokinetics of  xxxd2190xxx  was
characterized by separate assays of the antibody portion of the
conjugate as well as calicheamicin (total and unconjugated) in
plasma. the elimination half-life of the antibody was highly
variable after i.v. administration of the 9 mg/m2 dose and ranged
from 67 ⫾ 37 h to 88 ⫾ 58 h from dose period 1 to dose period
2. corresponding aucs were 132 ⫾ 136 and 243 ⫾ 198 mg ⬵
h/liter for dose periods 1 and 2, respectively. because approximately 50% of the antibodies are not linked to the calicheamicin derivative, the reliability of the antibody to characterize the
pharmacokinetics of  xxxd2190xxx  may be questioned. total calicheamicin elimination half-life and auc were
39 ⫾ 25 h and 2.1 ⫾ 1.8 mg/h/liter, respectively, after the first
dose period of  xxxd2190xxx  administration, and
both were increased in the second dose period (63 ⫾ 63 h and
4.7 ⫾ 4.1 mg/h/liter, respectively).
clearance of both antibody and unconjugated calicheamicin consistently decreased during subsequent dose periods, and
half-life, cmax, and auc were increased, independent of the
technique of measurement. although this observation may reflect a decrease in tumor burden in subsequent courses, no
definite correlation of increased clearance with increased peripheral blast count was observed. on the basis of the occurrence of dose-limiting myelosuppression and saturation of

 xxxg382xxx -binding sites, the recommended phase 2 dose was 9
mg/m2 i.v. over 2 h for two doses.
phase 2 trials in patients with aml in first relapse.
three open-label single arm studies (trials 201, 202, and 203)
were performed in patients with aml in first relapse (table 1).
this study design was deemed acceptable for registration on the
basis of the sponsor’s assertion that relapsed aml represented
an unmet medical need and the drug showed clinical promise in
phase i trials. patients with secondary leukemia, promyelocytic
leukemia (fab m3), previous myelodysplasia, or history of
prior chemotherapy for relapse were excluded. the most common subtypes accrued were m2, m1, m4, and m5 and reflected
reported natural distribution of fab subtypes. a total of 142
patients were enrolled, 59% male and 94% caucasian, with an
age range of 22– 84 and a mean age of 58. one study (203)
excluded patients under 60 years of age and had a higher mean
age of 69 years. patients were required to have ⬎5% blast cells
identifiable by flow cytometry, of which a “high percentage”
expressed  xxxg382xxx , as confirmed by a central laboratory. remission status was defined from the date bone marrow biopsies or
aspirate specimens were obtained. an independent pathologist
blinded to patients’ clinical status reviewed marrow pathology.
all of the patients were premedicated with 650-1000 mg of
acetaminophen and 50 mg of diphenhydramine p.o. entry criteria required pretreatment with hydroxyurea if the total wbcs
exceeded 30,000/␮l to reduce the risk of tumor lysis syndrome
in patients with high leukocyte counts. one hundred forty-two
patients received at least one 9 mg/m2 dose of gemtuzumab
ozogamicin, 109 patients (77%) received two doses, and 5
patients (4%) received three doses. the use of growth factors
was prohibited except for patients experiencing life-threatening
infections because of prolonged neutropenia.
activity. the primary end point of cr, defined as transfusion independence, absence of peripheral blasts, ⱕ5% residual marrow blasts, hemoglobin ⱖ9 g/dl, an absolute neutrophil
count of ⱖ1500/␮l, and a platelet count of 100,000/␮l, was
achieved in 16% of patients (table 2). with the inclusion of
“crps,” the total number of responders was 42, for an or rate
of 30%. the rfs of all of the relapsed aml patients in the
 xxxd2190xxx  trials who attained a remission was 6.8
months: 7.2 months for the cr group and 4.4 months for the
crps. the survival of patients in the cr and crp categories
appeared similar (fig. 2), although the numbers were inadequate
to derive any definitive conclusions regarding the comparability
of these groups. although preliminary evidence suggests that
the crs and crps experience improved survival compared with

nonresponders, comparisons between responders and nonresponders tend to be problematic. the comparability of the crs
and crps remains to established by further clinical experience.
in the absence of a concurrent control group, it was not possible
to derive any definite conclusions regarding the relative efficacy
of  xxxd2190xxx  as compared with conventional
cytotoxic induction chemotherapy.
the two variables most consistently correlated with response in relapsed aml are patients’ age and length of first
remission: older age and shorter remission duration are associated with an inferior prognosis. the mean age was 61 years in
the  xxxd2190xxx  studies. the or rate in the 62
patients ⬍60 years of age was 34%, whereas the or rate in the
80 patients ⱖ60 years old was 26% (table 2). however, patients
over 60 years of age had a much shorter rfs of 2.3 months
versus 17 months for patients ⬍60 years of age. remission rates
were 28% and 32% for patients with durations of first remission
⬍1 year and ⱖ1 year, respectively.
forty-five percent (19 of 42) of patients who achieved
remission were prescribed additional antileukemic therapy, including hsct. therefore, it is not possible to make any definite
conclusions regarding the duration of response of gemtuzumab
ozogamicin in patients with relapsed aml because the type of
postremission consolidation therapy is known to affect longterm survival (14). of the 42 patients who achieved remission,
15 went on to hsct, 4 received other postremission treatments,
and 23 had no further therapy. median rfs of patients who
attained a remission and subsequently received a hsct was not
reached. among patients who did not receive further therapy,
the median rfs was 2.1 months.
tolerability. the three phase 2 trials in 142 patients with
aml in first relapse suggest a safety profile of gemtuzumab
ozogamicin distinct from standard induction chemotherapy.
most patients tolerated the infusions without significant complications; 5 of 142 patients were treated without hospitalization. an infusion-related symptom complex of fever, chills, and
hypotension occurred commonly in patients treated with  xxxd2190xxx  despite prophylactic treatment with acetaminophen and antihistamine. this symptom complex may be
related to cytokine release and appeared to be less common
during the second dose. one third of patients reported a grade
3– 4 infusion-related adverse event. the incidence of grade 3 or
4 hypotension was 5% and generally resolved after i.v. fluid

support (and in one case vasopressors). three patients were
reported with grade 3– 4 hypoxia, which eventually resolved
after treatment with oxygen. two patients in the phase i studies
exhibited evidence of development of antibodies after receiving
more than two doses of  xxxd2190xxx : one patient
developed antibodies after receiving a third dose of  xxxd2190xxx  and was asymptomatic, and the other developed antibodies during a second course of therapy and had a
transient episode of dyspnea after infusion. development of
antibodies was not reported in the phase 2 studies. four cases of
tumor lysis syndrome were reported; one was fatal. prevention
of tumor lysis syndrome with supportive measures including
hydration, allopurinol, and leukoreduction with hydroxyurea or
leukapheresis is recommended in patients with leukocytosis.
bleeding is a common and potentially serious complication
of the treatment of aml, most often secondary to thrombocytopenia. bleeding varied in severity from petechiae and mild
epistaxis to fatal hemorrhage (table 3). one patient died of a
retroperitoneal hemorrhage, one patient who was treated with a
preexisting coagulopathy developed a fatal intracerebral hemorrhage within 5 h of treatment, and another patient with thrombocytopenia developed an intracranial hemorrhage 1 day after
treatment. three patients died of cerebral hemorrhage ⬎30 days
from the last dose of  xxxd2190xxx . patients with
crps required more platelet and probably more packed rbc
transfusions before the attainment of transfusion independence.
the overall incidence of severe bleeding appeared to be similar
in the cr and crp groups.
calicheamicin caused liver toxicity in preclinical studies,
and  xxxd2190xxx  is associated with clinical hepatotoxicity. in the phase 2 clinical trials, 45 patients had at least
one grade 3 or 4 hepatic function abnormality, 33 patients (23%)
showed severe (grade 3– 4) bilirubin elevations, and 12 patients
exhibited elevations of both transaminases and bilirubin. most
liver toxicity was transient and reversible; however, one patient
in study 201 exhibited persistent jaundice and ascites for several
weeks after treatment and eventually died of hepatic failure.
hepatotoxicity may be more common in patients who have
undergone hsct: of 27 patients who received hsct, 3 developed clinical hepatic vod and died 22, 30, and 37 days after
transplantation. one patient with a history of vod who relapsed
after transplant was treated with  xxxd2190xxx  and
died after an episode of severe liver toxicity.
in the absence of randomized studies, definitive conclusions regarding relative toxicities of  xxxd2190xxx 
and conventional cytotoxic induction chemotherapy cannot be
made. however, the rates of hematological toxicity, bleeding,
and treatment-related mortality reported in relapsed aml patients treated with  xxxd2190xxx  appeared to be
similar to those rates reported in studies with conventional
chemotherapy (table 4). mucositis and infections may be decreased, whereas significant hepatotoxicity may be more common, particularly in association with previous or subsequent
hsct.

 xxxd2190xxx  studies were presented at the march
14, 2000 public meeting of the oncology drugs advisory committee. the committee concluded that there was evidence to
suggest that crps were comparable with crs; therefore, the
combined or rate could be used as evidence of efficacy. the
oncology drugs advisory committee reached a consensus that
this drug provided a useful therapeutic option in patients over 60
years of age with relapsed aml who would not be candidates
for standard cytotoxic chemotherapy. the combined or rate
was believed to represent a surrogate likely to predict clinical
benefit.

the agency accepted the committee’s recommendation,
and  xxxd2190xxx  was given accelerated marketing
approval on may 17, 2000, about 7 months after submission of
the nda and 6.5 years after the original investigational new
drug application (ind) was filed.  xxxd2190xxx  is
indicated for use in patients with  xxxg382xxx  positive aml in first
relapse who are 60 years of age or older and are not candidates
for cytotoxic chemotherapy. the recommended dose was 9
mg/m2 i.v. over 4 h and repeated in 14 days.
under the accelerated approval phase 4 regulations, the
sponsor is required to complete the original studies in relapsed
aml. in the absence of randomized trials, the response rates
cannot be compared directly with standard induction chemotherapy. until further clinical experience is available, gemtuzumab
ozogamicin should not be used for treatment of aml in younger
patients and those who are candidates for standard induction
chemotherapy except in the context of clinical trials. additional
studies are mandated under subpart h to confirm the clinical
benefit of  xxxd2190xxx  in randomized, controlled
trials evaluating the effects on survival of adding gemtuzumab
ozogamicin to conventional cytotoxic chemotherapy in patients
with de novo aml. additional studies are ongoing to evaluate
the safety and efficacy of  xxxd2190xxx  in the context of hsct.
postmarketing data. subsequent to the approval of this
drug, a large number of spontaneous reports of severe adverse
events in patients receiving  xxxd2190xxx  prompted
an early review of postmarketing safety data. reports collected
during the first 6 months after approval were grouped into the
most commonly reported severe adverse events: hypersensitivity reactions, pulmonary toxicity, and hepatotoxicity.
severe hypersensitivity was defined as a life-threatening
reaction with onset temporally related to drug administration,
during or a short time after infusion, involving at least two of the
following organ systems: respiratory, skin, and cardiovascular

systems. nine cases of severe hypersensitivity reactions were
reported after treatment with  xxxd2190xxx , four of
them fatal. eight reported the onset during or after the patients’
first  xxxd2190xxx  exposure, and one began immediately after the beginning of the second infusion. most reactions occurred during infusion or within 2 h after infusion.
fevers, rigors, chills, diaphoresis, and “anaphylactoid type”
reactions have been reported (15) in patients receiving monoclonal antibodies associated with binding to high levels of
circulating cells; direct cytokine release is postulated to be the
cause.
eight patients were identified who experienced pulmonary
events immediately after or within 24 h of the gemtuzumab
ozogamicin 2-h infusion, of whom six had initial leukocyte
counts above 60,000/␮l. five were described as adult respiratory distress syndrome, and three were reported as “pulmonary
edema.” five deaths were reported in these patients. although
pulmonary leukostasis has a similar clinical presentation and
occurs in about half of the patients presenting with blast counts
above 100,000/␮l (16), the temporal association of these events
with drug administration suggests a drug reaction. acute pulmonary events including adult respiratory distress syndrome
have been described (17, 18) with the use of unconjugated
therapeutic antineoplastic monoclonal antibodies, including rituximab and trastuzumab, and may be associated with pulmonary
neoplastic involvement. reduction in peripheral blast counts to
below 30,000/␮l with hydroxyurea or leukapheresis should be
considered before  xxxd2190xxx  administration.
calicheamicin as well as  xxxd2190xxx  are both
known to cause hepatotoxicity in preclinical models. as of april
30, 2000, 11 of 271 (4%) patients treated in the phase 2 studies
and 6 of 120 (5%) patients treated by individual physicians
developed vod. since marketing approval, five spontaneous
reports of liver failure were reported in patients treated with
 xxxd2190xxx , two with prior histories of hsct, and
one with a history of concomitant inh administration. three
deaths were reported, one in a patient with prior hsct (19). of

27 patients in the original nda studies who subsequently underwent hsct, 3 developed fatal vod (11%).
vod has been reported after treatment with gemtuzumab
ozogamicin in patients who subsequently receive hsct, as well
as in patients without a previous history of hsct (23). on the
basis of these reports, the division of oncology drug products
has initiated revisions of the product label to include warnings
regarding the risk of hypersensitivity reactions, pulmonary
events, and hepatic toxicity, as well as a recommendation to
reduce leukocyte counts below 30,000/␮l prior to treatment. a
registration program has been initiated and further studies are
ongoing to ascertain more precisely the risk of adverse events
following treatment with  xxxd2190xxx .
