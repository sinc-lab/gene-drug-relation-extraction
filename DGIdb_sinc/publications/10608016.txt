abstract. background: enhanced thrombin generation has
been found in patients with peripheral arterial obstructive
disease (paod). the objective of this study is to investigate
the effect of thrombin inhibition in paod patients. methods:
 xxxd218xxx  (20 rag/day) was infused intravenously over 2
hours for 14-68 days in 27 patients with chronic paod of the
lower extremities. plasma thrombin- xxxg2056xxx  complex (tat) levels and clinical signs were assessed. results:
tat levels before  xxxd218xxx  therapy were significantly
higher in the paod patients than in age- and gendermatched controls. in the paod patients, tat levels increased stepwise in the presence of rest pain classified as
fontain iii and iv. to assess the effect of thrombin inhibition, we divided the patients into a high-tat group (pretreatment tat level ->5 ng/ml, n = 12) and a low-tat group
(pretreatment tat level <5 ng/ml, n -- 15). in the high-tat
group, tat levels were suppressed in 8 of 12 patients after
the administration of  xxxd218xxx , along with improvement
of their clinical symptoms and a decrease in the size of ischemic skin ulcers, indicating that  xxxd218xxx  clearly inhibited
thrombin generation in vivo. even in the low-tat group,
 xxxd218xxx  improved the clinical signs and symptoms, and
also reduced the size of ischemic skin ulcers although tat
levels remained within the low range (<5 ng/ml) in 13 of the
15 patients, indicating that paod signs and/or symptoms
may be related to small amounts of thrombin generated locally at the sites of atherothrombotic stenotic lesion. conclusions: these results suggest that thrombin generation was
enhanced in paod and that the amount was related to disease severity. thrombin inhibition by  xxxd218xxx  may break
this vicious cycle and lead to clinical improvement in paod.

recent studies have disclosed a close relationship between peripheral arterial obstructive disease (paod)
and coagulation activation [1,2]. thrombin has various

biological actions, such as fibrin formation, fibrin stabilization through activation of factor xiii, platelet
aggregation, and smooth muscle cell proliferation
[3]. thrombin generation in vivo is assessed by the
thrombin- xxxg2056xxx  (tat) concentration
[4], and high tat levels have been reported in paod
patients [1,2]. enhanced thrombin generation may accelerate the progression of paod and of various clinical symptoms and signs.
 xxxd218xxx  is a recently developed potent selective
thrombin inhibitor [5-10]. it has been suggested to
be more effective than heparin in preventing coronary
thrombosis and in preventing restenosis after percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (ptca) in
patients with coronary artery disease [7-14]. the aim
of the present study was to characterize the effect of
thrombin inhibition by  xxxd218xxx  on tat levels and
the clinical status of paod patients.

patients a n d methods
this study was a multicenter clinical trial of  xxxd218xxx  therapy for paod. the study protocol was approved by the relevant institutional review boards.
informed consent was obtained from all patients.

patients and clinical assessment
twenty-seven patients with chronic lower extremity
arterial obstructive disease were enrolled in this
study. the severity of paod was assessed by the
fontain classification. eleven patients had ischemic
ulcers of the lower extremities. the clinical character-

ap < 0.05; bp < 0.01. each subgroup is comparedwith the control group.
tat = thrombin- xxxg2056xxx  complex;paod = peripheral arterial obstructive disease.

istics of the patients are summarized in table 1. patients with a systolic blood pressure ->160 m m h g or
a diastolic pressure ->95 m m h g (or both) on three
occasions, or those who received antihypertensive
drugs, were diagnosed as having hypertension. patients with a serum total cholesterol level ->220 rag/
dl, a triglyceride level ->150 mg/dl, or both, or those
who received antihyperlipidemic drugs, were diagnosed as having hyperlipidemia.
 xxxd218xxx  (10 mg) was infused for 2 hours twice
daily (total dose: 20 mg daily). the administration period was at least 14 days and ranged from 14 to 68
days. the following three clinical signs and symptoms
were assessed by grading: cold feeling of skin
(grade 1: no cold feeling; grade 2: sometimes occurs
in cold conditions; grade 3: sometimes or often occurs
without cold conditions; grade 4: always occurs), pain
(grade 1: no pain; grade 2: occasional pain after exercise; grade 3: analgesia sometimes or often required;
grade 4: analgesia always required; grade 5: unable to
sleep at night because of pain despite use of analgesia), cyanosis (grade 1: none; grade 2: slight; grade 3:
moderate; grade 4: severe). the size of ischemic skin
ulcers was also assessed. clinical improvement was
graded by two or more doctors in the conference.

blood sampling
blood samples were obtained on the day before the
administration of  xxxd218xxx  (day 0), on the 14th day
after the initiation of  xxxd218xxx  therapy (day 14), and
on the 28th day (day 28), when the administration

period was over 28 days. blood collection was done
just before the administration of  xxxd218xxx  on each
day. blood samples for tat determinations were collected into disposable siliconized vacuum glass tubes
containing 3.8% trisodium citrate (9 vol blood to i vol
0.13 m trisodium citrate). plasma was subsequently
separated at each hospital, transferred with dry ice
to the assay laboratory, and stored at -20~
tat
levels were assayed within 1 week of blood collection.
simultaneously obtained serum samples and edtacontaining samples were also used for routine laboratory assays.

assay procedures
tat was assayed by e l i s a [interassay coefficient
of variation (cv): <5%] [4]. serum total cholesterol,
triglycerides, and glucose were determined using
routine enzymatic assays. routine laboratory tests
(white cell and red cell counts, platelet count, hematocrit, and transaminases, creatinine, electrolytes, lipids, etc.) were performed to detect any adverse effects of therapy.

statistical analysis
the mann-whitney u test was used for the comparison of paod patients and controls. the wilcoxon
signed-rank test was used for the comparison of tat
values on day 0 with those on days 14 and 28. a p
value <0.05 was taken to indicate statistical significance.

results
plasma tat levels in the paod patients
the tat levels of the paod patients before  xxxd218xxx  therapy and those of age- and gender-matched
controls are shown in table 1. tat levels (mean _+
sd) were significantly higher in the paod patients
than in the controls (10.2 -+ 14.2 vs. 2.3 - 1.8 ng/ml,
p < 0.01). both the tat level and the proportion of
patients with a tat level ->5 ng/ml increased along
with the increasing severity of paod. a stepwise increase of tat was especially found in patients with
rest pain classified as fontain iii and iv. the presence or absence of risk factors for vascular disease
(hypertension, diabetes, and hyperlipidemia) or complications (coronary artery disease, chronic cerebral
infarction, and atrial fibrillation) did not significantly
affect tat levels in our patients.
changes of tat with  xxxd218xxx  therapy
the changes of tat levels during the administration
of  xxxd218xxx  are shown in figure 1. the reference
value of tat (<5.0 ng/ml) is shown as the hatched
area. we divided the study patients into two groups
(a high-tat group with tat levels >-5.0 ng/ml, n =
12 and a low-tat group with tat levels <5.0 ng/ml,
n = 15). tat levels decreased by >1 ng/ml in 8 of
12 patients from the high-tat group after the administration of  xxxd218xxx , and four patients showed levels of <5.0 ng/ml on day 28 (figure 1a). this marked
decrease in tat was not affected by the presence or
absence of diabetes mellitus. in the low-tat group,
13 of 15 patients had unchanged low tat levels (figure 1b), while two diabetic patients had an increase
of >1.0 ng/ml on day 14 or day 28.

changes in clinical signs and symptoms with
 xxxd218xxx  therapy
changes in the clinical signs and symptoms during
 xxxd218xxx  therapy are shown in figure 2. the percentage of patients whose clinical symptoms and signs
were improved (a decrease >-1 grade) was 70%, 84%,
and 78%, respectively, and the percentage of those
who showed marked improvement (a decrease >-2
grades) was 13%, 53%, and 44%, respectively. five
of the eight (63%) patients whose tat levels decreased by >1.0 ng/ml, 7 of the 15 (47%) patients with
unchanged tat levels, and 1 of the 4 (25%) patients
with tat levels that increased by >1.0 ng/ml showed
marked clinical improvement (cold feeling of skin,
pain, or cyanosis was decreased by >-2 grades). on
the other hand, 1 of the 8 (13%) patients whose tat
levels decreased by >1.0 ng/ml, 4 of the 15 (27%) patients with unchanged tat levels, and 1 of the 4 (25%)
patients with tat levels that increased by >1.0 ng/
ml had no changes in their s~mptoms. there were no
patients whose clinical signs or symptoms were
worsened by  xxxd218xxx  therapy, and no adverse reactions, including abnormal laboratory findings, were
noted.
changes of ischemic skin ulcers with
 xxxd218xxx  therapy
the changes in the size of ischemic skin ulcers with
 xxxd218xxx  therapy are shown in figure 3 for 11
paod patients. in 9 out of the 11 patients, the ulcer
size was decreased. among the two patients whose
ulcer size did not change despite  xxxd218xxx  therapy,
one had no change in tat levels and the other showed
an increase of >1.0 ng/ml.

fig. 3. changes in the size of ischemic skin ulcers during  xxxd218xxx  therapy. closed circles show the patients whose t a t
levels decreased by >1.0 ng/ml on day 14 or day 28 (n = 4).
open circles show those in whom t a t levels did not changed
>1.0 ng/m (n = 6). the crosses indicate the patients whose
t a t levels increased by >1.0 ng/ml (n = 1).

the tat level before  xxxd218xxx  therapy and the proportion of patients with a tat level ->5 ng/ml were
significantly higher in the paod group than in ageand gender-matched controls (table 1). in our paod
patients, tat levels increased stepwise in the presence of rest pain classified as fontain iii or iv. these
results suggest that thrombin generation was enhanced in paod patients and that the amount of enhancement was related to disease severity. in the
present study, the difference in tat levels was not
significant in mild paod (fontain i or ii). we assessed paod patients only by clinical symptoms and
signs using the fontain classification and did not assess the severity of atherothrombosis by morphological methods. however, a recent study disclosed that
tat levels were related to the severity of atherosclerosis as assessed by duplex ultrasonography and/
or angiography in mild paod without rest pain or
skin ulcers [1]. thus, the amount of thrombin generation appears to be closely related to the clinical status
of paod from mild to severe, and may further accelerate paod by several adverse biological effects [3].
platelet activation is also reported in paod [2]. at
the site of thrombus or at the site where platelets are
activated, various heparin-neutralizing factors ( xxxg1726xxx , thrombospondin, and histidine-rich glycoprotein) are secreted.  xxxd218xxx  is a new synthetic
thrombin inhibitor that is highly selective and potent
(k1 = 0.039 ~m) [5]. it has the advantage of not requiring  xxxg2056xxx  as a cofactor and thus escapes the influence of these heparin-neutralizing platelet products [13]. it also competitively inhibits
thrombin-induced platelet activation and clotting
[6,10,13]. this agent also potently inhibits thrombin

argtroban in peripheral arterial disease

on the surface of clots or on injured vessel walls denuded of endothelium [8,10]. thus, it is proposed to be
especially effective for arterial thrombosis. we have
recently shown that  xxxd218xxx  is effective in inhibiting thrombin generation after ptca and that it prevented restenosis in a coronary artery disease patient
with congenital  xxxg2057xxx  deficiency, although heparin did not do so [12]. thus,  xxxd218xxx 
seems to effectively inhibit in vivo thrombin generation on the injured arterial walls of paod patients.
there have been few papers concerning the
changes in plasma tat levels with  xxxd218xxx  therapy. recently, rebound thrombin generation was reported after cessation of a 4-hour infusion of a specific
thrombin inhibitor in patients with unstable angina
pectoris. in that study, tat levels remained unchanged during the infusion of  xxxd218xxx , whereas a
significant 2.3-fold decrease in  xxxg784xxx  levels
was observed. in contrast, tat levels increased 3.9fold over baseline 2 hours after infusion, together with
a return of  xxxg784xxx , to levels seen before
treatment with  xxxd218xxx . thus, the authors concluded that  xxxd218xxx  inhibits thrombin activity toward fibrinogen ( xxxg784xxx  decreases), while in
vivo thrombin generation (tat) is not suppressed, so
the cessation of  xxxd218xxx  infusion is associated with
rebound thrombin (tat) generation. in their study
 xxxd218xxx  infusion rates of 0.5-5.0 ~g/kg/min were
well tolerated and resulted in a 1.5- to 3-fold prolongation of aptt [14]. in the present study, the dose of
 xxxd218xxx  was 10 mg over 2 hours, corresponding to
1.5 ~g/kg per rain. we used this dose twice daily for
at least 14 days. we divided the study patients into a
high-tat group and a low-tat group to clarify the
thrombin-inhibiting effect of  xxxd218xxx . the hightat group seemed to be patients in whom the contribution of thrombin was greater than their clinical
signs and symptoms. in the high-tat group, tat
levels were suppressed in 8 of 12 patients after the
administration of  xxxd218xxx  (figure 1a). though we
did not investigate the presence of the previously reported rebound thrombin generation after the cessation of  xxxd218xxx , considering our clinical results and
the decrease of tat in the high-tat group, the longterm intermittent use of  xxxd218xxx  appears to inhibit
thrombin in vivo is clinically effective for paod.
our dose of  xxxd218xxx  seemed to achieve clinical
improvement without any adverse reactions, such as
bleeding. however, there were nine patients whose
tat levels remained above 5.0 ng/ml (figure 1). in
these patients, thrombin generation seemed to be
markedly enhanced and could not be inhibited completely by the administered dose of  xxxd218xxx , with
the residual thrombin producing high tat levels. the
dosage of  xxxd218xxx  should be increased in such patients along with assessment of the tat level after
initial therapy.
even in the low-tat group,  xxxd218xxx  improved
the clinical signs and symptoms, and reduced the size

135

of ischemic skin ulcers. local thrombin generation
may not be reflected as an increase of tat levels in
the bloodstream. however, even locally generated
thrombin on stenotic atherothrombotic lesions can
activate platelets and has biological actions [3] that
may further accelerate the progression of atherothrombosis. since clinical improvement of signs,
symptoms, and ischemic skin ulcers in the in vivo
thrombin inhibition of  xxxd218xxx  is found in the lowtat group, this indicates that local thrombin generation at the site of stenotic lesions is closely related to
the clinical signs and symptoms of paod.
our present study indicated that thrombin, even
in small amounts, contributes to the pathogenesis of
paod and that potent thrombin inhibition by  xxxd218xxx  breaks the vicious cycle of progression and leads
to clinical improvement.
