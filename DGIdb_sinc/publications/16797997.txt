abstract—two series of fentanyl-derived hybrid molecules bearing potent i2–imidazoline binding site (ibs) ligands (i.e., guanidine
and bu224 moieties) linked with an aliphatic (m = 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9 and 12 methylene units) or aromatic spacer were prepared. their
aﬃnities for the l-opioid receptors and for the i2–ibs were determined through competition binding studies on human postmortem
brain membranes. whereas the bu224 hybrid molecules bound to the l-opioid receptor and the i2–ibs in the micromolar to low
micromolar range, the alkaneguanidine series exhibited remarkable aﬃnities in the nanomolar range for both receptors. [35s]gtpcs
functional assays were performed on human postmortem brain membranes with selected ligands from each series (4f and 8g) showing the highest dual aﬃnity for the l-opioid receptor and i2–ibs aﬃnities. both compounds displayed agonist properties: at the
l-opioid receptor for the alkaneguanidine derivative 4f (spacer: six methylene units) and at a  xxxg89xxx  (gpcr)
which remains to be determined for 8g. the lack of analgesic properties of 4f in vivo (i.e., hot plate and writhing tests in mice),
discordant with the good in vitro binding data (ki l = 1.04 ± 0.28 nm, ki i2 = 409 ± 238 nm), may possibly be due to the low intrinsic eﬃcacy of the compound. alternatively, a low access to the central nervous system for this kind of hybrid molecules cannot be
ruled out. two new compounds reported here (9f and 13), which were not dual acting, are worth mentioning for their outstanding
binding aﬃnities; 9f bound to the l-opioid receptor with a picomolar aﬃnity (ki = 0.0098 ± 0.0033 nm), whereas 13 presented an
i2–ibs aﬃnity (ki = 18 ± 11 nm) similar to the reference compound bu224.

1. introduction
diﬀerent studies have revealed that some agents that do
not interact directly with opioid receptors are able to
regulate the pharmacological actions of opioid ligands.
in particular, involvement of imidazoline binding site
(ibs) ligands1 in the modulation of analgesia2 and withdrawal eﬀects of morphine has been observed in mice
and rats.3–7 this is the case, for example, of the putative
endogenous ibs ligand  xxxd94xxx  (chart 1) which
enhances analgesic action of morphine and inhibits tolerance and dependence to opioids.8 our interest in a

possible new therapy that aims at reducing tolerance
developed along with the treatment by opioid drugs
led us to investigate a new series of dual acting drugs
that interact with l-opioid receptor and ibs simultaneously albeit separately. among the advantages of
the multiple target ligand approach compared with the
co-administration of multiple drugs are a better patient
compliance, a more practical use in the clinical settings
and a lower risk of drug–drug interactions.9
the existence of a chemical entity displaying concomitant opioid receptor and i2–ibs aﬃnities was unknown
in the literature at the start of our studies.9,10 in our
previous work, two series of hybrid molecules incorporating a fentanyl core (i.e., opioid moiety) and guanidine-like moieties (i.e., ibs ligand) were synthesized
and pharmacologically evaluated (chart 1).10,11 all of
these hybrid structures showed moderate to high aﬃnity
towards l-opioid receptor, whereas only few of them

probe further these ﬁndings, three new derivatives with
an alkyl spacer (3f, 5f and 7f)] were synthesized and
evaluated. for these series, an extensive modulation of
the chain length of the alkyl spacer between the two
pharmacophoric groups, fentanyl and guanidine, is presented (scheme 1, table 1). in addition, a more rigid
analogue with a m-xylene spacer (9f) was also prepared
and evaluated in order to explore possible structural
needs for these hybrid molecules.

besides, we also wish to report the synthesis of new compounds (2g, 4g, 6g and 8g) that display the combination
of the potent and selective i2–ibs ligand bu224 and the
l-opioid ligand fentanyl. bu2241 (chart 1) is a selective
i2–ibs ligand which has also demonstrated interesting
spinal antinociceptive properties in vitro.12

had high aﬃnity for i2–ibs.11 of special interest was the
structure–activity relationship for a series of agmatinelike hybrid molecules, the methylene linker length of
which seemed to correlate well with i2–ibs aﬃnity. to

the aﬃnity of the two series of compounds presented
here was evaluated at the i2–ibs and at the l-opioid
receptor. in addition, the functional activity of two
hybrid molecules was also investigated through
[35s]gtpcs assays on postmortem human frontal cortex
membranes. we chose to use membranes from human
brain which could be more relevant from a therapeutically vantage point. the analgesic potential of the most
promising dual ligand (4f) was evaluated in mice by hot
plate and writhing tests.

2. results
2.1. chemistry
the amines 1d–9d were synthesized in four steps starting
from the corresponding diamines 1–9 and following a
procedure previously described by us.11 in summary,
the reductive amination (nabh3cn, ph 7–8) of 1-phenethyl-4-piperidone with the mono-protected diamines
1a–9a aﬀorded amines 1b–9b which were subsequently
acylated with propionic anhydride to aﬀord the corresponding propanamides 1c–9c. treatment with
cf3co2h aﬀorded the amines 1d–9d as their triﬂuoroacetate salts (scheme 1).
the bu224 moiety (14) was prepared in ﬁve steps from
the commercially available quinoline precursor (scheme
2). esteriﬁcation of methylquinoline-6-carboxylate with
socl2/meoh yielded 10 which was converted to the
cyano-derivative 12 in two steps applying the procedure
that kaneko et al. used for the synthesis of methyl
2-cyanoquinoline 5-carboxylate.13 formation of the
imidazoline nucleus was accomplished by heating the
cyanide 12 in the presence of ethylenediamine and a
catalytic amount of p2s5 in reﬂuxing toluene to aﬀord
13. mild hydrolysis of the methyl ester 13 by treatment
with lioh aﬀorded 14. this reaction has to be carefully
monitored since hydrolysis of the imidazoline moiety is
a possible competitive reaction.
two series of hybrid molecules were prepared starting
from the diamines 1d–9d (scheme 3). the guanidines
were introduced with the classical boc-protected thiourea reagent14 which allows the puriﬁcation of the
boc-protected guanidines by sio2 chromatography.
removal of the boc-protecting group with cf3co2h
aﬀorded the guanidine hybrids 1f–9f. coupling of the

acid 14 with amines 2d, 4d, 6d and 8d in the presence
of mukayama’s reagent aﬀorded the corresponding hybrid molecules 2g, 4g, 6g and 8g, respectively. the diﬃculty of the silica puriﬁcation was evidenced by the
presence of multiple by-products. isolation of a signiﬁcant quantity of 1-methyl-pyridinium adducts of the
amines (2d, 4d and 8d) and of further substitution products of the imidazoline nitrogen might account for the
low yield of these couplings (8–46%).
the nmr spectra of the propanamide compounds
showed characteristic duplicated signals corresponding
to the observation of the amide cis–trans isomerism
around the n–co bond as previously reported.10
2.2. pharmacology
2.2.1. binding aﬃnity. the binding aﬃnity of the new
compounds (3f, 5f, 7f, 9f, 2g, 4g, 6g and 8g) and 1f,
2f, 4f, 6f and 8f11 was evaluated through competition
binding assays against the selective i2–ibs radioligand
[3h]-2-bfi and the selective l-opioid ligand [3h]damgo following the procedure previously described.10,15–17
the assays were performed in membranes from postmortem human frontal cortex, a brain area that shows
an important density of i2–ibs and l-opioid receptors.
drug competition studies were performed with either
[3h]-2-bfi (1 nm) or [3h]-damgo (2 nm) in the absence or presence of various concentrations of competing drugs (1011–103 m, nine concentrations). nonspeciﬁc binding was estimated in the presence of
103 m idazoxan in experiments with [3h]-2-bfi, or
with 104 m naloxone in [3h]-damgo assays. the
opioid agonist fentanyl and the i2–ibs-selective ligand
idazoxan were used as references (tables 1 and 2).
guanidine hybrid molecules. table 1 shows the results of
binding of the guanidine hybrid series of the newly synthesized compounds (3f, 5f, 7f and 9f) and previously
reported molecules (1f, 2f, 4f, 6f and 8f). regarding

noteworthy is the excellent l-opioid aﬃnity observed
for the hybrid compound 9f with the m-xylene spacer
(ki = 0.0098 ± 0.0033 nm). however, this compound
was not a l/i2 dual ligand since it lacked i2–ibs binding
aﬃnity.
bu224 hybrid molecules. the aﬃnity for the l-opioid
receptor was lower in this series, aﬀording only low
micromolar binding for hybrid molecules with linkers
of 8 and 12 methylene units (6g and 8g, table 2). shorter
spacers (3 or 6 methylene units, 2g and 4g, respectively)
aﬀorded low aﬃnity l-opioid ligands. in this series, the
best aﬃnities for i2–ibs were also observed for the longest linkers 4g and 8g (m = 6 and 12) with the exception
of 6g (m = 8) which did not bind to i2–ibs. the most
balanced i2/l binding aﬃnity of this series was obtained
with the 12 methylene spacer hybrid molecule 8g
(table 2).
besides the binding studies performed on the bu224 hybrid molecules, two new analogues of bu224 (13 and
14) were evaluated as i2–ibs ligands. noteworthy was
the excellent i2–ibs aﬃnity displayed by 13, a new 6methyl ester analogue of bu224 (ki = 18 ± 11 nm vs
9.8 ± 0.3 nm for bu22418). interestingly, hydrolysis of
the ester group of 13 to give the 6-carboxylic acid analogue (14) led to a 30-fold loss in binding aﬃnity for
i2–ibs.
2.2.2. [35s]gtpcs functional assay. the therapeutic potential of these new families of i2–ibs/l-opioid hybrid
compounds as possible l-opioid modulators depends
on their functional activity (i.e., agonist/antagonist) because l-opioid agonists would have analgesic properties,
whereas antagonists would not. hence, we decided to
assess the functional activity of two of these new hybrid
molecules using the [35s]gtpcs assay in postmortem
human brain samples.19 this assay constitutes a functional measure of the interaction of the receptor and
the g-protein, the ﬁrst step in activation of g-protein
coupled receptors (gpcrs). it is a useful tool to distinguish between agonists (increasing the nucleotide binding), inverse agonists (decreasing the nucleotide
binding), and neutral antagonists (not aﬀecting the
nucleotide binding) of gpcrs.
in order to conﬁrm the nature of the functional activity
of both families of dual compounds, we selected in each
family one molecule that presented the ‘best dual aﬃnity.’ hence, the intrinsic activity of 4f and 8g, which
showed the highest l-opioid receptor along with an
acceptable i2–ibs aﬃnity, was investigated with
[35s]gtpcs binding experiments on membranes of postmortem human frontal cortex.
the guanidine derivative 4f induced an increase in the
[35s]gtpcs binding of 25% compared to basal level
(fig. 1a) revealing agonist properties. this eﬀect was
reverted in the presence of naloxone 105m indicating
agonist properties at the human l-opioid receptor.
the apparent low potency of this compound
(ec50 = 4.21 ± 0.57 lm) compares favourably with that
of the l-opioid agonist damgo (ec50 = 77.1 ±

17.1 lm) in this assay. it should be noted that ‘aﬃnities
of tritiated agonists for receptors in postmortem human
brain are usually several orders of magnitude higher
than the potencies of these agonists stimulating
[35s]gtpcs binding both in rat and in postmortem human brain membranes.’20
compound 8g showed a marked increase in nucleotide
binding compared to basal level (+125%). however, this
eﬀect was not reverted in the presence of naloxone
105m (fig. 1b). several classes of gpcrs present in
membranes from postmortem human frontal cortex
(e.g., a2–adrenoceptors, cb1–cannabinoid, or 5ht1)
could potentially be activated by this compound and
explain the observed [35s]gtpcs binding activity.
2.2.3. in vivo assays. because 4f proved to be a l-opioid
agonist in the binding experiments, we decided to evaluate its analgesic potential in vivo in the hot plate and
writhing tests in mice (table 3). unfortunately, this
compound did not produce signiﬁcant analgesia in both
assays up to 40 mg/kg ip. the experiments were discontinued because of toxicity problems (27.3% death at
40 mg/kg). the lack of analgesic activity of 4f in the
hot plate and writhing tests may possibly relate to its
low eﬃcacy in the functional assay. alternatively, a
poor blood–brain barrier (bbb) penetration of this
dicationic compound and the consequent lack of activation of the opioid receptors in the cns might also
explain the in vivo results.
3. discussion
our approach towards the management of opioid-induced tolerance developed during treatment with opioid
drugs like fentanyl led us to design and synthesize several hybrid molecules that are able to interact with both
i2–ibs and l-opioid receptors. the ﬁrst goal of this
study was the development of new  xxxd94xxx -like hybrid
analogues modulating the chain length of the methylene
spacer (1f–8f, table 1) in order to ﬁnd the optimum distance between the pharmacophoric units for a balanced
aﬃnity on i2–ibs and l-opioid receptors. in this series,
we clearly found that the best spacer for l-opioid aﬃnity
should have between four and seven methylene units (3f,
4f and 5f). longer (6f–8f) or shorter (1f–2f) spacers lead
to a decrease in binding aﬃnity for these receptors. on
the other hand, the best binding aﬃnity for i2–ibs
was observed with the longest spacers (7f and 9f, 9
and 12 methylene units, respectively), conﬁrming our
previous ﬁndings on this kind of alkaneguanidine derivatives.11,15 we previously observed11 that the presence
of the phenethylpiperidyl propanamide pharmacophore
of the fentanyl structure could lead to a synergistic eﬀect
for the binding of alkaneguanidinium moieties to i2–ibs
since alkaneguanidines alone (i.e., monoguanidinium)
show very poor i2–ibs aﬃnity.15 this synergistic eﬀect
seems to exist also for the binding to l-opioid receptors.
accordingly, we observed that amines 2d and 3d (as
their tfa salts) showed no binding to these receptors
(kil = 4689 ± 2232 and >10,000 nm, respectively),
whereas their guanidinium derivatives 2f and 3f had ki

of 23 and 0.59 nm, respectively. these results altogether
indicate that in this series of hybrid molecules the presence of the guanidinium cation is crucial for the binding
to l-opioid receptors, while the fentanyl skeleton confers i2–ibs aﬃnity to the alkylguanidinium moiety.
the remarkable l-opioid aﬃnity of the m-xylene derivative 9f (ki = 0.0098 ± 0.0033 nm), which represents a
1000-fold increase compared to its m-phenyl analogue
(ki = 7.8 ± 2.5 nm),10 seems to indicate the needs of
more ﬂexibility for this ligand to ﬁt into the l-opioid
receptor active site. the m-xylene spacer may alter the

spatial positioning of the guanidinium group to bind
to the l-opioid receptor. on the contrary, 9f was devoid
of i2–ibs aﬃnity (ki > 10,000 nm) compared to its mphenyl analogue (ki = 1890 ± 499),10 indicating that
more conformational ﬂexibility of the guanidine moiety
around the phenyl ring was detrimental for the binding
of these aromatic derivatives to i2–ibs.1 compound 9f
is not a dual ligand but has impressive picomolar aﬃnity
for the l-opioid receptor. further in vitro and in vivo
studies of this compound are warranted even though
this goes beyond the present work focusing on dual acting ligands.
the second family of hybrid molecules synthesized, the
bu224 derivatives 2g, 4g, 6g and 8g, only aﬀorded
micromolar ligands for both receptors, the longest spacers giving the best aﬃnities for both receptors. these
trends may reveal the importance of steric factors for
the binding of these hybrid molecules to l-opioid receptors and i2–ibs.
the binding aﬃnity observed for the new 6-substituted
analogues of bu224 (13 and 14) is especially interesting
since they demonstrate that the incorporation of a methyl ester group in this position of the quinoline ring of
bu224 hardly aﬀects its binding to i2–ibs (table 2).
in contrast, a carboxylic acid moiety in that position
leads to a 60-fold decrease in binding aﬃnity. since
the carboxylate group is likely to be deprotonated under
physiological conditions, these diﬀerences may indicate

6576

c. dardonville et al. / bioorg. med. chem. 14 (2006) 6570–6580

that the presence of a negatively charged substituent in
the 6-position of the quinoline ring has a detrimental effect on the binding to i2–ibs.
4. conclusion
the synthesis of new hybrid molecules incorporating the
fentanyl skeleton and a guanidine moiety linked with an
alkyl or aromatic spacer allowed to gain insights into the
sar of this family of compounds. hence, we veriﬁed
that the presence of the guanidine and the n-phenethyl
piperidyl propanamide core was necessary for these hybrid compounds to bind to both i2–ibs and l-opioid
receptors. the new family of bu224-derived dual compounds only produced moderate aﬃnity ligands for
these receptors, possibly due to a bigger steric hindrance
of the bu224 core.
to conclude, the guanidinoalkyl fentanyl derivatives
represent an interesting family of l-opioid/i2–ibs hybrid ligands that showed agonist properties (i.e., 4f) at
the human brain l-opioid receptor. even though 4f
was devoid of analgesic action in vivo, possibly due to
its low eﬃcacy and/or to unfavourable pharmacokinetic
properties, these hybrid molecules represent attractive
lead compounds.

5.1. chemistry
reactions were monitored by tlc using pre-coated silica gel 60 f254 plates. chromatography was performed
either with silica gel 60 pf254 (particle size 40–63 lm) or
with 50 g si isolute prepacked columns. all reactions
requiring anhydrous conditions or an inert atmosphere
were performed under a positive pressure of n2. dry
ch2cl2 was obtained by distillation over cacl2. 1h
and 13c nmr spectra were recorded on a varian gemini 200, bruker advance 300 or varian inova 400 spectrometer. chemical shifts of the 1h nmr spectra were
internally referenced to the residual proton resonance
of the deuterated solvents: cdcl3 (7.26 ppm), d2o
(d 4.6 ppm), cd3od (3.49 ppm) and dmso (d
2.49 ppm). melting points were determined with a reichert-jung thermovar apparatus and are uncorrected.
elemental analysis was performed on a heraeus
chn–o rapid analyser. analytical results were within ± 0.4% of the theoretical values unless otherwise noted. electrospray mass spectra were recorded on an
msd–serie 1100 hewlett packard apparatus.

5.2. general synthetic procedures
a. mono-protection of diamines with boc. a 0.5 m solution of boc2o (1 equiv) in chcl3 was added dropwise

over a 2 h period to a 0.25 m solution of diamine 1–9
(5 equiv; typical scale: 250–500 mmol) in chcl3 cooled
with an ice-bath. the reaction mixture was stirred overnight at room temperature and ﬁltered. the ﬁltrate was
concentrated under vacuum and the resulting oil dissolved in etoac (400 ml) was washed with half-saturated brine (3· 150 ml), dried ( xxxd2534xxx ) and
concentrated under vacuum to aﬀord pure mono-bocprotected diamine 1a–9a. further puriﬁcation by silica
chromatography was necessary for the diamine with
more than six methylene units and 1a.

other chemicals were of the highest purity commercially
available.
5.3.1. preparation of membranes. postmortem human
frontal cortex samples of each subject (1 g) were
homogenized using a teﬂon–glass grinder (10 up-anddown strokes at 1500 rpm) in 30 volumes of homogenization buﬀer (1 mm egta, mm mgcl2, 1 mm dtt
and 50 mm tris–hcl, ph 7.4) supplemented with
0.25 m sucrose. the crude homogenate was centrifuged
for 5 min at 1000g (4 c) and the supernatant was centrifuged again for 10 min at 40,000g (4 c). the resultant pellet was washed twice in 20 volumes of
homogenization buﬀer and recentrifuged in similar conditions. aliquots of 1 mg protein were stored at 70 c
until assay. protein content was measured according to
the method of bradford using bsa as standard, and
was similar in the diﬀerent brain samples.
5.3.2. [35s]gtpcs binding assays. the incubation buﬀer
for measuring [35s]gtpcs binding to brain membranes
contained, in a total volume of 500 ll, 1 mm egta,
3 mm mgcl2, 100 mm nacl, 50 mm gdp, 50 mm
tris–hcl at ph 7.4 and 0.5 nm [35s]gtpcs. protein aliquots were thawed and re-suspended in the same buﬀer.
the incubation was started by addition of the membrane suspension (40 lg of membrane proteins) to the
previous mixture and was performed at 30 c for
120 min with shaking. in order to evaluate the inﬂuence
of the compounds on [35s]gtpcs binding, eight concentrations (1010–103 m) of the diﬀerent drugs were added
to the assay. incubations were terminated by adding 3 ml
of ice-cold re-suspension buﬀer followed by rapid ﬁltration through whatman gf/c ﬁlters pre-soaked in the
same buﬀer. the ﬁlters were rinsed twice with 3 ml of
ice-cold re-suspension buﬀer, transferred to vials containing 5 ml of optiphase hisafe ii cocktail (wallac, uk)
and the radioactivity trapped was determined by liquid
scintillation spectrometry (packard 2200ca). the
[35s]gtpcs bound was about 7–14% of the total
[35s]gtpcs added. non-speciﬁc binding of the radioligand was deﬁned as the remaining [35s]gtpcs binding
in the presence of 10 lm unlabelled gtpcs.
5.3.3. in vivo analgesia
animals. male swiss mice (ﬁnal weight 26–32 g) were
housed 6 per cage on a 12 h light–dark cycle at 22 c with
free access to food and water. the animals were allowed
to habituate to the laboratory environment for at least 2 h
before any experiment was initiated; they were used only
once and killed by cervical dislocation after testing.
writhing test. the abdominal constrictor test was
performed by the intraperitoneal (ip) injection of acetic
acid (2%; 10 ml/kg) to produce the typical writhing
reaction that mimics acute visceral pain (arching of
back, development of tension in the abdominal muscles,
elongation of the body and extension of the hind limbs).
immediately after the acetic acid administration, the
animals were placed in individual transparent cages
and the number of writhes was counted during a

6580

c. dardonville et al. / bioorg. med. chem. 14 (2006) 6570–6580

20 min period. the test was carried out twenty min after
the ip injection of compound 4f (20 and 40 mg/kg,
n = 10–11) or the same volume of saline (5 ml/kg,
n = 12). morphine (10 mg/kg, ip, n = 9) was used as a
positive control. the analgesic activity was expressed
as the percent inhibition of the number of writhes observed in saline control animals (16.7 ± 3.5, n = 12).
hot-plate test. mice were placed in a hot plate
(le7406, panlab s.l.; spain) at 55 ± 0.1 c as a nociceptive stimulus and the time of latency until jumping was
taken as the end point, with a cut-oﬀ time of 120 s. the
time of latency was determined 30 min before and at different times (5–120 min) after the ip injection of separated
doses of compound 4f (1, 10, 20 and 40 mg/kg, n = 6) or
the same volume of saline (5 ml/kg, n = 10). morphine
(2.5, 5 and 10 mg/kg, ip) was used as a positive control.
antinociceptive activity was expressed as the percentage
of the maximal possible eﬀect (% mpe), which was calculated as follows:
% mpe = 100 · (latency of treated  latency of saline)/
(cut-oﬀ time  latency of saline). the latency of saline
was 25 ± 2s (n = 10).
