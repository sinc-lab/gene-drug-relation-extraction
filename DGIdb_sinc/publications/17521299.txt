abstract

systemic administration of 3-nitropropionic acid (3-np), a complex ii inhibitor of the
electron transport chain, causes motor and cognitive deficits that are associated with
excitotoxicity and excessive free radical generation. recently, cyclooxygenase (cox)
inhibitors have been implicated as a neuroprotectant in the treatment of various
neurological disorders. the present study was designed to investigate the effects of
cox inhibitors in 3-np-induced cognitive impairment and oxidative stress in rats.
intraperitoneal administration of 3-np (20 mg/kg for 4 days) showed motor
abnormalities and cognitive impairment in rats. chronic treatment with naproxen
(10 and 20 mg/kg) and  xxxd3481xxx  (5 and 10 mg/kg) once daily for a period of
8 days beginning 4 days prior to 3-np administration significantly improved 3-npinduced motor and cognitive impairment in rats. biochemical analysis revealed that
systemic 3-np administration significantly increased lipid peroxidation and nitrite
levels, depleted  xxxd2213xxx  levels and reduced succinate dehydrogenase
(sdh) activity in the brains of rats, whereas administration of naproxen, a
nonselective cox inhibitor (10 and 20 mg/kg p.o.) and  xxxd3481xxx , a selective
cox-2 inhibitor (5 and 10 mg/kg p.o.) significantly attenuated 3-np-induced
oxidative stress. cyclooxygenase inhibitors also significantly restored the decreased
sdh activity. the results of the present study clearly indicate that naproxen and
 xxxd3481xxx  showed protection against 3-np-induced motor and cognitive impairment
by decreasing oxidative stress.

introduction
3-nitropropionic acid (3-np), a mitochondrial toxin,
causes striatal neuropathy in animals and humans [1,2].
3-np is the most recent model of huntington’s disease
(hd). the major advantages of 3-np model over other
models of hd are that the lesions produced are bilateral,
striatal specific and develop spontaneously after systemic
administration of 3-np [3]. neuronal damage is seen
consistently in the striatum [4], but was also observed in
other brain areas including the cerebellum [1,4]. the
primary mechanism of 3-np-induced neurotoxicity
involves the irreversible inhibition of the mitochondria
enzyme succinate dehydrogenase (sdh) that directly
linked to the electron transport chain. inhibition of sdh

interferes with electron transport cascade and oxidative
phosphorylation that leads to cellular energy deficit.
likewise, 3-np-induced inhibition of sdh also results in
a decrease in atp production [2] and oxidative stress as
indicated by the increase in lipid peroxidation products
and depletion of  xxxd2213xxx  (gsh) and the
induction of antioxidant enzyme activities [5].
a number of theories have been proposed to understand the pathogenesis of huntington’s disease, such as
excitotoxicity, apoptosis, oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction [6,7]. one of the first steps in
excitotoxic neuronal damage involves the hyperstimulation of n-methyl-d-aspartate (nmda) receptors leading
to a massive calcium influx that activates other processes
including calcium-dependent  xxxg1759xxx  (pla2)

cascade [8]. further, pla2 cleaves membrane phospholipids to yield  xxxd208xxx  (aa), a free fatty acid,
which is converted by cyclooxygenases (cox) into
prostaglandins (pgs) [9].
it is well known that cox exists in two isoforms, i.e.
cox-1 and -2. accumulating evidences also indicate
that cox isoforms contribute to excitotoxicity. recently,
the expression of cox-2 has been shown to be an
important determinant of the cytotoxicity connected
with inflammation following injury to the brain [10].
it is well reported that cox-2 expression increases in the
pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases, such
as alzheimer’s disease, parkinson’s disease and other
neurological diseases [11,12]. further, neuroprotective
effects of cox inhibitors in various neurological and
neurodegenerative models have also been reported
[13,14]. despite numerous studies having reported the
role of cox isoforms and the beneficial effects of cox
inhibitors in various neurotoxicity models, their therapeutic potential in ameliorating cognitive dysfunction
and free radical-mediated toxicity that contribute to the
pathophysiology of hd have not been well studied.
thus, the present study was designed to determine
whether administration of naproxen, a nonselective cox
inhibitor and  xxxd3481xxx , a selective cox-2 inhibitor
attenuates the behavioral deficits and oxidative stress
consequent to administration of 3-np in rats.
materials and methods
animals
male wistar rats bred in central animal house facility of
the punjab university, chandigarh, and weighing
between 200 and 250 g were used. animals were
acclimatized to laboratory conditions prior to experimentation. the animals were kept under standard
conditions of light and dark cycle with food and water
ad libitum in groups of two in plastic cages with soft
bedding. all experiments were carried out between
09:00 and 15:00 hours. the protocol was approved by
the institutional animal ethics committee and carried
out in accordance with the indian national science
academy guidelines for the use and care of animals.
drugs and treatment schedule
the following drugs were used in the present study.
3-nitropropionic acid (loba chem, mumbai, india) was
diluted with saline (adjust ph 7.4). naproxen and
 xxxd3481xxx  (panacea biotech ltd, new delhi, india) were
suspended in 0.5% carboxymethyl cellulose (cmc) solu-

tion. naproxen and  xxxd3481xxx  were administered p.o.
(directly injected into mouth). 3-np was administered
intraperitoneally (i.p.). all the doses were administered in
a constant volume of 0.5 ml per 100 g of body weight.
animals were randomly divided into 10 groups of eight
animals each. group 1, vehicle-treated control group,
received vehicle for cox inhibitors (p.o.) and also normal
saline (i.p.); group 2 received 3-np (20 mg/kg i.p.) and
vehicle for cox inhibitors, i.e. cmc p.o. for four
consecutive days, groups 3 and 4 received naproxen
per se 10 and 20 mg/kg and saline injection i.p., once
daily for a period of 8 days respectively. groups 5 and 6
received  xxxd3481xxx  per se 5 and 10 mg/kg and saline
injection i.p., once daily for a period of 8 days respectively. group 7 received 3-np (20 mg/kg i.p.) for four
consecutive days and naproxen 10 mg/kg for a period of
8 days, beginning 4 days before and continuing for
4 days after the first injection of 3-np. group 8 received
3-np (20 mg/kg i.p.) for four consecutive days and
naproxen 20 mg/kg for a period of 8 days beginning
4 days before and continuing for 4 days after the first
injection of 3-np and group 9 received 3-np (20 mg/kg
i.p.) for four consecutive days and  xxxd3481xxx  5 mg/kg
once daily for a period of 8 days beginning 4 days before
and continuing for 4 days after the first injection of 3-np.
group 10 received 3-np (20 mg/kg i.p.) for four consecutive days and  xxxd3481xxx  10 mg/kg once daily for a
period of 8 days beginning 4 days before and continuing
for 4 days after first injection of 3-np. in these groups,
naproxen and  xxxd3481xxx  were given 1 h prior to 3-np
administration and the doses were selected on the basis of
previous laboratory studies [15,16] and those reported in
the literature. time schedule for 3-np and/or cox
inhibitor administration was explained in figure 1.
measurement of body weight
animal body weight was noted on the first and last days
of the experimentation. per cent change in body weight
was calculated in comparison with the initial body
weight on the first day of experimentation.
behavioral assessment
assessment of motor activity
assessment of gross behavioral activity (locomotor
activity). gross behavioral activity was assessed on day
1 (before the first dose of 3-np), day 2 (24 h after the first
dose of 3-np) and day 5 (24 h after last dose of 3-np)
following 3-np administration. each animal was observed
over a period of 5 min in a square (30 cm)-closed arena
equipped with infrared light-sensitive photocells using

figure 1 time schedule for administration of 3-nitropropionic acid
(3-np), vehicle and/or cyclooxygenase (cox) inhibitor in rats. the
control group received vehicle only. in 3-np-treated group four
doses of 3-np was administered to rats starting from day 1 to day 4,
whereas in drug-treated groups cox inhibitor was administered
4 days before (pretreatment) and 4 days during 3-np administration (co-treatment). the co-treatment doses of cox inhibitor were
given 1 h before 3-np administration for 4 days. the drug per se
groups received only cox inhibitor continuously for 8 days. the
behavioral observations were done on days 2 and 5 and were killed
at the end of behavioral assessment on day 5.

digital photoactometer and values expressed as counts per
5 min. the apparatus was placed in a darkened, light and
sound attenuated and ventilated testing room.
orofacial movements. on day 5 (24 h after last dose of
3-np), rats were placed individually in a small
(30 · 20 · 30 cm3) plexiglass cage for the assessment
of vacuous chewing movements (vcms) as described
previously [17]. the floor and the back wall of the cage
consisted of mirrors so as to permit observation of vcms
when the animals faced away from the observer. vcms
were measured continuously for a period of 5 min.
assessment of memory dysfunction
elevated plus maze paradigm. the elevated plus maze
consists of two opposite open arms (50 · 10 cm),
crossed with two closed arms of the same dimension
with 40-cm-high walls. the arms are connected with a
central square (10 · 10 cm2). the entire maze is
elevated at a height of 50 cm. acquisition of memory
was assessed on day 1 before initiating 3-np treatment.
rats were placed individually at one end of an open arm
facing away from the central square. the time taken to
move from the open arm and enter into one of the closed
arms was recorded as initial transfer latency (itl).
animals were allowed to explore the maze for 30 s after
recording itl and returned to its home cage. retention
of memory was assessed by placing a rat similarly on an

spatial navigation task. the acquisition and retention of a
spatial navigation task were examined using a morris
water maze [19]. animals were trained to swim to a
platform in a circular pool (180 cm diameter · 60 cm)
located in a test room. the pool is filled with water
(28 ± 2 c) to a depth of 40 cm. a movable circular
platform 9 cm in diameter, mounted on a column, was
placed in the pool 1 cm above the water level for maze
acquisition test and another movable (hidden) platform
9 cm in diameter, mounted on a column, was placed in the
pool 1 cm below the water level for maze retention test.
maze acquisition test (training). animals received a
training session consisting of four trials in a day for
4 days starting 4 days prior to 3-np administration. in
all the 4 · 4 trials the starting positions were different.
the latency to find the hidden platform was recorded up
to a maximum of 2 min. the platform was fixed in the
center of one of the four quadrants and remained in that
location for the duration of experiment. the time taken
by a rat in the last trial to reach the platform was
recorded as initial acquisition latency (ial).
maze retention test (testing for retention of the learned
task). following 24 h (day 2) and 4 days (day 5) after
ial, a rat was randomly released at any one of the edges
facing the wall of the pool and tested for the retention of the
response. the time taken to reach the hidden platform on
days 2 and 5 following initiation of 3-np treatment was
recorded and termed as first retention latency (first rl) and
second retention latency (second rl) respectively.
biochemical tests
biochemical tests were carried out immediately after
behavioral observations on day 5 following 3-np
administrations.
tissue preparation
animals were killed by decapitation and the brains were
removed and rinsed with ice-cold isotonic saline. brain
tissue samples were then homogenized with ice-cold
0.1 m phosphate buffer (ph 7.4) 10 times (w/v). the
homogenate was centrifuged  xxxd1891xxx  000 · g for 15 min
and aliquots of supernatant were separated and used for
biochemical estimation.

succinate dehydrogenase activity
succinate dehydrogenase is a marker of impaired mitochondrial metabolism in the brain. the quantitative measurement of sdh levels in the brain was performed. a total
of 0.3 ml of sodium succinate solution was mixed with
50 ll of gradient fraction of homogenate. the mixture
was incubated at 37 c for 10–20 min and then 0.1 ml of
solution of p-iodonitrotetrazolium violet (int) was added
and again incubated for further 10 min. the reaction
was stopped by adding 1 ml of a mixture of ethyl
acetate : ethanol : tricholoroacetic acid 5 : 5 : 1 (v/v/w)
and centrifuged at 15 000 rpm for 1 min and the
absorbance at 490 nm was determined with perkin-elmer
lambda 20 spectrophotometer (global medical instrumentation, inc, ramsey, mn, usa). results were
calculated using molar extinction coefficient of chromophore (1.36 · 104 m)1 cm)1) and expressed as percentage
of control.
measurement of lipid peroxidation
the quantitative measurement of lipid peroxidation in
the brain was performed according to the method of
wills [20]. the amount of malondialdehyde (mda),
a measure of lipid peroxidation was measured by a
reaction with thiobarbituric acid at 532 nm using
perkin-elmer lambda 20 spectrophotometer. the values
were calculated using molar extinction coefficient of
chromophore (1.56 · 105 m)1 cm)1) and expressed as
percentage of control.
estimation of  xxxd2213xxx 
reduced gsh in the brain was estimated according to the
method described by ellman [21]. a total of 1 ml of
supernatant was precipitated with 1 ml of 4% sulfosalicylic acid and cold digested at 4 c for 1 h. the samples
were centrifuged at 1200 · g for 15 min at 4 c. to 1 ml
of supernatant taken after centrifuged, add 2.7 ml of
phosphate buffer (0.1 m, ph 8) and 0.2 ml of 5,5¢-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (dtnb). the yellow color developed was read immediately at 412 nm using perkin-elmer
lambda 20 spectrophotometer. results were calculated
using molar extinction coefficient of chromophore
(1.36 · 104 m)1 cm)1) and expressed as percentage of
control.
estimation of nitrite
the accumulation of nitrite in the supernatant, an
indicator of the production of  xxxd2738xxx  (no), was
determined with a colorimetric assay with greiss reagent
(0.1% n-(1-naphthyl) ethylenediame dihydrochloride, 1%

sulfanilamide and 2.5% phosphoric acid) as described by
green [22]. equal volumes of supernatant and greiss
reagent were mixed, the mixture was incubated for 10 min
at room temperature in the dark and the absorbance at
540 nm was determined using perkin-elmer lambda 20
spectrophotometer. the concentration of nitrite in the
supernatant was determined from a sodium nitrite
standard curve and expressed as percentage of control.
protein estimation
the protein content was measured by  xxxd2444xxx  method as
described by gornall [23] using bovine  xxxg124xxx  as
standard.
statistical analysis
one specific group of rats was assigned to one specific
drug treatment condition and each group comprised
eight rats (n ¼ 8). all the values are expressed as
mean ± sem. the data were analyzed using analysis of
variance (anova) followed by tukey test. in all tests, the
criterion for statistical significance was p < 0.05.
results
effect of naproxen and  xxxd3481xxx  on
3-npa-induced body weight loss
there was no change in the initial and final body weight
of vehicle-treated animals. however, 3-np treatment
caused a significant decrease in body weight (25 ± 2%)
on day 5 when compared with vehicle-treated group.
administration of cox inhibitors naproxen (10 or
20 mg/kg) and  xxxd3481xxx  (5 or 10 mg/kg) significantly
attenuated the decrease in body weight because of 3-np
treatment in rats, whereas cox inhibitors per se had no
effect on the body weight in rats (table i).
effect of naproxen and  xxxd3481xxx  on gross
behavioral (locomotor activity) activity in
3-np-treated rats
in the present experiment, the mean scores of gross
behavioral activity on day 1 for each rat were relatively
stable and showed no significant variation. the mean
scores in vehicle control and naproxen per se and
 xxxd3481xxx  per se treated rats remained unchanged from
the mean scores of gross behavioral activity observed on
days 2 and 5 of the observation period. 3-np treatment
caused a significant decrease in locomotor activity when
compared with vehicle control group. further, administration of  xxxd3481xxx  (5 and 10 mg/kg) and the lower
dose of naproxen (10 mg/kg) did not improve the

effect of naproxen and  xxxd3481xxx  on 3-np-induced
memory impairment
effect on transfer latency on elevated plus maze
in the present experiment, the mean itl on day 1
before 3-np treatment for each rat was relatively stable
and showed no significant variation. all the rats
entered the closed arm within 90 s. following training,
vehicle-treated control and naproxen and  xxxd3481xxx 
per se rats entered the closed arm quickly and the mean
retention transfer latencies (first rtl and second rtl)
to enter the closed arm on days 2 and 5 were shorter
when compared with itl on day 1 of each group
respectively. in contrast, 3-np-treated rats performed
poorly throughout the experiment and an increase in
the mean retention transfer latencies on days 2 and 5
when compared with pretraining latency on day 1
demonstrates that 3-np induced cognitive dysfunction
in rats. administration of naproxen (10 and 20 mg/kg)
and  xxxd3481xxx  (5 and 10 mg/kg) 4 days prior to and
during 3-np treatment significantly decreased the mean
retention latencies on days 2 and 5 following 3-np
administration indicating a marked improvement
of memory impairment (p < 0.05 as compared to
3-np-treated group) (figure 4).

effect of naproxen and  xxxd3481xxx  on brain lipid
peroxidation and  xxxd2213xxx  levels in
3-np-treated rats
systemic administration of 3-np caused a marked
increase in free radical generation, lipid peroxidation,
and decline in antioxidant defense as indicated by a
significant rise in brain mda levels and depletion of
reduced gsh when compared with vehicle-treated rats.
further, there were no alterations in brain mda levels
and gsh levels due to naproxen and  xxxd3481xxx  per se
treatment when compared with vehicle-treated rats.
however, pre- and co-administration of naproxen (10
and 20 mg/kg) and  xxxd3481xxx  (5 and 10 mg/kg)
significantly attenuated the increase in mda levels and
gsh depletion in 3-np-treated rats (table ii).
effect of naproxen and  xxxd3481xxx  on 3-np-induced
nitrite levels in the brain
3-nitropropionic acid produced an increased in no
levels indicated by a significant rise in whole brain
nitrite levels. these changes were significantly decreased by the pre- and co-administration of naproxen
(10 and 20 mg/kg) and  xxxd3481xxx  (5 and 10 mg/kg)
in 3-np-treated rats. however, administration of cox
inhibitors per se did not have any effect on brain
nitrite levels (table ii).

discussion
the present study examined the role of cox inhibitors in
the prevention of 3-np-induced neurotoxicity. both
naproxen and  xxxd3481xxx  significantly improved motor
deficits, attenuated oxidative stress and improved sdh
activity in 3-np-treated rats. it seems that inhibition of
cox activity and subsequent blocking of free radical
generation might be responsible for attenuating 3-npinduced neurotoxicity in rats.
in the present study, administration of 3-np caused
significant weight loss and movement abnormalities in
rats. indeed, patients with late stage hd also exhibit
dysphagia and loss of body weight [24]. intriguingly,
treatments with cox inhibitors significantly improved
body weight in 3-np-treated rats. consistent with
previously reported studies, the results in the present
study showed motor abnormalities associated with
markedly impaired cognitive function following 3-np
administration [25,26]. it is well reported that 3-np
produces lesions in hippocampal pyramidal neurons, the
area of the brain that is associated with cognitive
performance [27]. a recent study suggested the possible
involvement of  xxxd208xxx  cascade in memory
acquisition and retention [28]. further, bilateral intrahippocampal injection of pge2, a metabolite in the
 xxxd208xxx  cascade, endotoxin or interleukin-1b,
potent inducers of cox-2, significantly impaired memory
that resemble alzheimer’s dementia, which was

attenuated by pretreatment with selective cox-2 or
nonselective cox inhibitors [28]. growing body of
evidence indicates that reactive oxygen species (ros)
formation and subsequent oxidative stress may cooperate in a series of molecular events that link to memory
impairment [29]. indeed, free radicals are intermediate
products in cox-mediated pg synthesis during the
peroxidase activity of this rate-limiting enzyme that
results in the production of ros. numerous evidences
suggest that cox and its products are important
mediators of neuronal injury and excitotoxicity mediated
free radical generation [30,31]. intriguingly, naproxen,
a nonselective cox inhibitor, markedly improved
3-np-induced movement abnormalities and cognitive
dysfunction, whereas  xxxd3481xxx , a selective cox-2 inhibitor, was partially effective in improving 3-np-induced
behavioral changes. thus, it is plausible that cox
inhibition decreased free radical formation and subsequent neuronal damage and improved behavioral
changes in 3-np-treated rats.
it is well reported that excitotoxicity plays a key role in
neurodegeneration in hd. of particular interest, cox
activation and/or induction occurs secondary to nmda
receptor activation [10,29,32]. the release of free fatty
acids, such as  xxxd208xxx , can be caused by the
activation of pla2, which cleaves fatty acid esters and is
activated by lipid peroxidation [8,31,33]. it has been
reported that pgs, such as pga1,  xxxd124xxx , and pge2,
cause neurotoxicity and stimulate the release of glutamate from astrocytes [8,31,34]. recent reports suggest
that cox inhibition plays a crucial role in protecting
neurons impacted by neurological insults, such as those
involved in ischemia and/or trauma [11,12]. indeed,
naproxen has shown attenuation of neuronal death
mediated by excessive activation of neuronal nmda
receptor in vivo [14]. in the present study, selective cox2 and nonselective cox inhibitors showed protection;
however, marked effect was observed with nonselective
cox inhibitor.
oxidative stress is considered one of the major
determinants of 3-np neurotoxicity [35–37]. indeed,
radical formation and oxidant injury play a critical role
in excitotoxic damage as evidenced by the presence of
lipid peroxidation products, including isoprostanes, in
brain tissues from hd patients [38]. indeed, free
radicals are intermediate products in cox-mediated
pg synthesis during the peroxidase activity of this ratelimiting enzyme that results in production of ros. an
increase in lipid peroxidation is also reported in the
literature in 3-np-treated rats [37,38,39]. it is also

reported that quinolinic acid, an excitotoxin, also
caused a significant reduction in striatal gsh in rats
[3]. in the present study, chronic administration of cox
inhibitors significantly and dose-dependently protected
against 3-np-increased lipid peroxidation and gsh
depletion in the brains of rats. this is further supported
by a recent study that demonstrates that cox inhibitors
markedly reduced oxidative stress [40]. further, no, as
a precursor for free radicals, reacts with superoxide
anions produced as a result of excitotoxicity, peroxidase
activity of cox and oxidative stress after systemic
administration of 3-np that gives rise to toxic intermediates (peroxynitrite, nitric dioxide and nitron ion)
[41,42]. cox inhibition is reported to decrease inos
activity [43]. moreover, it has been recently reported
that nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents have shown
to scavenge  xxxd2298xxx  and no-free radicals
[44]. the present investigation demonstrates that both
cox isoforms are involved in the increase in oxidative
injury in the brain and attenuation of oxidative stress
could account for the protective effect seen with these
agents.
in an attempt to determine the possible effect of cox
inhibition on sdh, an enzyme in kreb’s cycle that
governs mitochondrial function and energy production,
we also measured brain sdh activity. consistent with
previous reports, in the present study, systemic administration of 3-np caused a marked decrease in sdh
activity, which was significantly restored by a high dose
of naproxen; however,  xxxd3481xxx  had shown a weak
effect. the observation supports a mechanism of action
for cox inhibitors that includes modulation of mitochondrial function. moreover, cox inhibitors showed
neuroprotective effect in several studies by ameliorating
brain inflammation [13,14]. further, various antioxidants also reversed reduced sdh enzyme activity
[35–37]. the present data suggest that attenuation of
oxidative stress by cox inhibitors might contribute to
the restoration of decreased sdh activity.
in conclusion, regardless of the exact mechanisms of
neuro protection, the present study demonstrates that
cyclooxygenase inhibitors can be useful against 3-npinduced neurotoxicity.
