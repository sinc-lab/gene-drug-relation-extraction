clinical response to  xxxd2703xxx  was
strongly associated with high bimmcl-1 or bim-bcl-2 ratios, providing
evidence of the selectivity of the drug
for targeting the bcl-2 family in patients
(roberts et al., 2012). additional correlative studies built into the ongoing clinical
trials of  xxxd3502xxx  include analysis of
 xxxg250xxx  gains,  xxxg250xxx  amplification, as
well as bh3 profiling. these assays
have the potential to help predict the
toxicities and efficacy of  xxxd3502xxx ,
perhaps even one day to guide personalized therapy of cancer patients.
whether  xxxd3502xxx  will be most effective
as a single agent or in combination
with other agents will be important to
determine. moreover, the biological
insights gained through correlative
studies will help inform the rational
design of combination trials to determine

the optimal role for  xxxd3502xxx  in the treatment of cancer.
