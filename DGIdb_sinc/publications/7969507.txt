abstract. the aim of the study was to further explore the
prejunctional /?-adrenoceptor-mediated control mechanism of noradrenaline release from sympathetic nerves in
response to preganglionic nerve stimulation (pns) and
local nerve stimulation of the portal vein, respectively, in
the pithed rat.
baseline values as well as the increments of mean arterial blood pressure (a-bp), heart rate (a-hr) and plasma
noradrenaline levels (a-na) in response to four pns
episodes (0.8 hz, 3 ms, 75 v for 45 s at 20 min intervals),
respectively, were evaluated.  xxxd2098xxx  administration
(0.25 mg/kg, i.v.) reduced significantly the basal blood
pressure but did not alter a-bp in response to pns. basal
heart rate markedly increased after  xxxd2098xxx  without any
further change in heart rate induced by pns.
the ill-selective antagonist cgp 20712a attenuated
a-bp in response to pns and prevented the  xxxd2098xxx -induced increase in basal heart rate. the  xxxd752xxx -selective antagonist ici 118,551 per se did not change the blood pressure and heart rate values, but antagonized the fenoterolinduced decrease in basal blood pressure.
 xxxd2098xxx  enhanced plasma a-na in response to pns
by 105% in comparison to the corresponding control
value. this effect of  xxxd2098xxx  could be blocked by
pretreatment with ici 118,551 but not with cgp 20712a
(a selective/~l-adrenoceptor antagonist) which per se did
not significantly change plasma a-na.
repeated local stimulation of the portal vein (s 1-s 3,
2 hz, 3 ms, 10 ma, for 120 s at 30 min intervals) increased portal plasma noradrenaline without changing mean
blood pressure and heart rate in pithed rats.  xxxd2098xxx  enhanced the increase in portal-vein plasma noradrenaline
evoked by nerve stimulation by 110°70. pretreatment with
ici 118,551 antagonized this effect of  xxxd2098xxx , but had
per se no effect on the portal vein nerve stimulation-evoked increase in portal plasma noradrenaline.
it is concluded that the increase in plasma noradrenaline evoked both by pre- and postganglionic nerve stimu-

lation can be markedly enhanced by activation of a facilitatory prejunctional  xxxd752xxx -adrenoceptor control mechanism.

introduction
postganglionic sympathetic nerve terminals are endowed
with at least two adrenoceptor-mediated mechanisms
which when activated by endogenous substances or drugs
can either inhibit or enhance the amount of noradrenaline release per nerve impulse. thus, there is overwhelming documentation which support the hypothesis that
noradrenaline released during sympathetic nerve stimulation is subjected to local modulation via a prejunctional
a-adrenoceptor-mediated negative feedback mechanism
(starke 1977; rand et al. 1980; langer 1981). in addition,
adler-graschinsky and langer (1975) reported a facilitatory control mechanism for the release of noradrenaline
mediated by prejunctional fl-adrenoceptors. since then,
substantial evidence, particularly from experiments performed in vitro, has been accumulated which support the
existence of a facilitatory prejunctional fl-adrenoceptor
mediated control mechanism. accordingly, exposure to fladrenoceptor agonists leads to increased neurotransmitter release per nerve impulse which can be competitively
blocked by fl-adrenoceptor antagonists (dahl6f 1981;
majewski 1983; misu and kubo 1986). a reduced stimulation evoked outflow of noradrenaline during exposure
to a fl-adrenoceptor antagonist was, however, not always
demonstrable (misu et al. 1981; stevens et al. 1982;
moulds and stevens 1983; steenberg et al. 1983). hence,
the physiological role of the prejunctional/3-adrenoceptors has also been challenged.
unlike the observed pronounced capacity of prejunctional a-adrenoceptors to inhibit the evoked noradrena-

571

line release (majewski et al. 1983; kahan et al. 1987a),
few in vivo studies showed that activation of prejunctional /?-adrenoceptors causes a small to moderate enhancement of evoked neurotransmitter release (kahan
and hjemdahl 1987; kahan et al. 1987b; majewski et al.
1982; schmidt et al. 1984). in previous studies, however,
we demonstrated that activation of prejunctional /?adrenoceptors by  xxxd2098xxx  caused a pronounced facilitation of the noradrenaline release elicited by electrical
stimulation of the portal vein nervous plexus from permanently cannulated freely moving rats (remie et al.
1988 a, b). this interesting finding arose the question why
such a pronounced facilitation of noradrenaline release
mediated by activation of prejunctional/?-adrenoceptors
found in the vasculature of the freely moving rats had not
been shown before with one exception (yamaguchi et al.
1977).
the aim of the present study was to further elucidate
this pronounced capacity of prejunctional/%adrenoceptots to facilitate sympathetic neurotransmission in vivo.
thus, the effect of  xxxd2098xxx  on the increase in plasma
noradrenaline evoked (1) by preganglionic nerve stimulation (pns) and (2) by local stimulation of the portal vein
nervous plexus was studied in the pithed rat model. furthermore, the study has addressed to what extent selective
/31- or /~2-adrenoceptor blockade is able to reduce the
stimulation-induced increase in plasma noradrenaline per
se and to antagonize the effect of  xxxd2098xxx  in this experimental model.

materials and methods
pithed rat technique. male wistar rats, weighing 2 7 0 - 3 5 0 g were used.
changes in m e a n blood pressure, heart rate and plasma noradrenaline
levels in response to pns were studied in the pithed rat model, as described below.
the rats were anaesthetized with  xxxd2599xxx  sodium (60 m g / k g ,
i.p.) which normally causes a short-lasting anaesthesia (about 15 rain).
as soon as the anaesthesia was established, the trachea was cannulated
and bilateral vagotomy was performed at the cervical level. then, the
rat was pithed by insertion of a steel rod (1.5 m m diameter) through the
orbit, brain tissue and foramen m a g n u m , down the spinal cord to the
level of the first to second sacral vertebra. a steel needle was inserted
under the skin of the back, parallel to the vertebral column, to serve as
indifferent electrode.
artificial respiration (4 ml/respiration/kg, 75 respirations/min/kg
and 40/60°7o inspiration/expiration ratio) was immediately started.
the right carotid artery was cannulated for continuous blood pressure and heart rate recordings by means of a statham p 23 ac transducer connected to a hse elektro manometer. the left carotid artery was
cannulated for collection of blood samples. the right jugular vein was
cannulated for drug administration. in order to prevent clotting of the
blood the catheters were flushed with heparinized saline (heparin i0 i.e/ml).
pancuronium bromide (2 m g / k g , i.v.) and atropine (1 m g / k g , i.v.)
were injected 10 minutes after pithing to prevent muscle contractions
and muscarinic receptor activation, respectively, during efferent electrical stimulation of the whole thoracolumbar sympathetic outflow.
the rats were allowed to accommodate for about 40 min after
pithing, whereupon 4 consecutive pns (pns 1-4, 0.8 hz, 3 ms, 75 v, for
45 s) at 20 rain intervals were performed using a grass s 88 stimulator.
mean blood pressure and heart responses to pns 1-4 were used to
evaluate cardiovascular effects. thus, increases from m e a n basal blood
pressure and heart rate to the peak pressure and heart rate in response

to pns 1-4 (abp and ahr, respectively) were determined. to avoid
electrical disturbances during stimulation, the heart rate response to
stimulation was recorded immediately after the end of stimulation.
for the determination of pns-evoked plasma noradrenaline increase
(a-na), arterial blood samples (each of 0.25 ml) were collected 60 s before and 45 s after each pns was initiated. fluid losses were compensated for by i.v. injections (0.5 ml) of 6.6°70 bovine  xxxg124xxx  in saline
about 5 min before each stimulation period. body temperature was kept
within the normal range (about 37 °c) throughout the experiments by
means of a thermostated heating pad.
the following groups of pithed rats were studied:
group i-a, control (n = 7): the animals received only saline injection (i.v.) 10 min prior to pns 3.
group i-b,  xxxd2098xxx  ( n = 6 ) : the animals received  xxxd2098xxx 
(0.25 m g / k g , i.v.) 10 min prior to pns 3.
group i-c, icil18,551 and  xxxd2098xxx  ( n = 6 ) : 1 0 m i n prior to
p n s 2 , the animals were pretreated with a bolus injection of
ici 118,551 (0.3 m g / k g , i.v.) and then received an ici 118,551 infusion
(0.1 m g / k g / m i n , i.v.) throughout the experiment. ten min before pns 3,
the animals received  xxxd2098xxx  (0.25 m g / k g , i.v.).
group i-d, c g p 20712a and  xxxd2098xxx  (n = 6): the animals were
pretreated with c g p 20712a (3 mg/kg, i.v.) 10 min prior to pns 2 and
then received  xxxd2098xxx  (0.25 m g / k g , i.v) 10 min prior to pns 3.

portal vein experiments. the local release of noradrenaline evoked by
stimulation of the nervous plexus of the portal vein was also determined
in pithed rats.
the rats were anaesthetized with  xxxd2599xxx  sodium (60 m g / k g ,
i.p) and the portal vein was cannulated according to the method described by remie and z a a g s m a (1986). briefly, the portal vein was exposed via an incision in the abdominal wall. a five stich purse-string suture was placed in the wall of the portal vein at the side opposite the
gastroduodenal vein, being viewed under a zeiss opmi 7 operation microscope. a silicone cannula was inserted downstream into the vessel
and was anchored with the drawstrings of the suture. a bipolar electrode was placed around the portal vein distal to the cannula, as described (remie and zaagsma 1986). then, the rat was pithed and artificial respiration immediately started, as described above.
the right carotid artery was cannulated for continuous blood pressure and heart rate recordings by means of a statham p 23ac transducer
connected to a hse elektro manometer. the right jugular vein was cannulated for drug administration.
pithing was followed after 1 h by 3 stimulation periods of the nervous plexus of the portal vein using square wave constant current
(10 ma) and biphasic pulses (s i-3; hz, 3 ms and for 120 s) at 30 rain intervals.
for the determination of plasma noradrenaline, blood samples each
of 0.25 mi, were withdrawn from the portal vein at the following times
of each 2 rain stimulation period: 2 and i rain before the stimulation
started (the average was calculated and considered as basal plasma noradrenaline value), every 30 s during the stimulation period (4 samples)
and 1 rain after the end of the stimulation. the increase in plasma noradrenaline evoked by nerve stimulation during 2 rain was expressed as
the area under the curve (auc), calculated by trapezoid integration, as
described before (remie et al. 1988a). fluid losses were compensated
for by i.v. injections of blood (2 ml) about 25 min before each stimulation period. the blood was withdrawn from resting donor rats with a
permanent catheter in the jugular vein.
the mean arterial blood pressure and heart rate values were recorded immediately before the first blood sample was collected in each stimulation period. in some few experiments no blood samples were collected in order to determine whether local stimulation of the portal vein
produce changes in m e a n arterial blood pressure and heart rate values.
the following groups of pithed rats were studied:
group ii-a, control (n = 6): the animals received only saline injection (i.v.) 15rain prior to $3.
group ii-b,  xxxd2098xxx  (n = 5): the animals received  xxxd2098xxx 
(0.25 m g / k g , i.v.) 15 min prior to $3.
group ii-c, ici 118,551 and  xxxd2098xxx  (n = 5): 15 rain prior to $2,
the animals were pretreated with a bolus injection of ici 118,551
(0.3 m g / k g , i.v.) and then received an ici 118,551 infusion

results

(0.1 mg/kg/min, i.v.) throughout the experiment. fifteen min before s 3,
the animals received  xxxd2098xxx  (0.25 mg/kg, i.v.).
all protocols described were approved by the university of groningen animal health committee which is responsible for the care and
proper use of experimental animals.

preganglionic nerve stimulation

assay of plasma noradrenaline. each blood sample was transferred into
an ice-cold plastic tube containing a few crystals of edta and immediately centrifuged (beckmann microfuge). from 100 gl plasma, the content of noradrenaline was analyzed by hplc with electrochemical
detection according to the method described by remie et al. (1988a).
statistical evalution of the data. all data are expressed as the
mean_+ sem. blood pressure, heart rate and plasma noradrenaline values were evaluated statistically by one-way analysis of variance followed
by simultaneous multiple comparisons using scheff6's test, in order to
determine individual differences (wallenstein et al. 1980). probability
levels of less than 0.05 were taken to indicate a significant difference.
drugs. the drugs and their sources were as follows:  xxxd247xxx 
(sigma, st. louis, mo, usa), bovine  xxxg124xxx  fraction v (sigma,
st. louis, mo, usa), 1-[2-((3-carbamoyl-4-hydroxy)phenoxy)ethylamino]-3-[4-(l-methyl-4-trifluoromethyl-2-imidazolyi)phenoxyj- xxxd2400xxx  (cgp 20712 a) (ciba-geigy, basel, switzerland)  xxxd2098xxx  hydrobromide (boehringer-ingelheim, ingelheim, frg),  xxxd2033xxx -dl-l-(7methylindan-4-yloxy)-3-isopropylaminobutan-2-ol hydrochloride (ici
118,551) (ici, macclesfield, uk);  xxxd2599xxx  ( xxxd2599xxx , eli lilly & co.,
indianapolis, usa), pancuronium bromide (organon, the netherlands) and heparin (lovens l~tkemedel, malta0, sweden).

the average responses to the first pns in each group of
pithed rats did not not differ significantly and for this
reason the results are presented as a total average. accordingly, pns-i evoked an immediate increase in blood pressure by 86_+2mmhg (from 53+1 to 139_+3mmhg,
n = 2 5 ) and in heart rate by 91_+5beats/min (from
333 +7 to 424_+ 8 beats/rain, n = 25). these cardiovascular responses gradually declined to basal levels within
3 rain. the average plasma levels of noradrenaline increased by 182+ 14 pg/ml (from 41 +5 to 223 _+16 pg/ml,
n = 25) during the first pns.
saline injection per se did not change blood pressure
and heart rate values in control rats (group i-a). repeated stimuli of the sympathetic outflow (pns 1-4) elicited
almost identical blood pressure and heart rate responses
(table 1 a, b). furthermore, the basal values of plasma
noradrenaline within the control group over the whole period (pns 1-4) as well as plasma a-na in response to
pns l-4 (table 1 c, fig. 1 a), respectively, did not significantly differ.

effect of  xxxd2098xxx  (group i-b).  xxxd2098xxx  injection
(0.25 mg/kg, i.v.) prior to pns 3 significantly reduced the

table 1. mean arterial blood pressure (bp) (a), heart rate (hr) (b) and plasma noradrenaline (na) (c) values corresponding to four periods of
preganglionic nerve stimulation (pns, 0.8 hz for 45 s with 20 rain intervals). the following groups of pithed rats were studied: group i-a, control:
received saline (0.1 ml/kg, i.v.); group i-b, fen: received  xxxd2098xxx  (0.25 mg/kg, i.v.) 10 min prior to pns 3; group i-c, ici + fen: received ici
118,551 (0.3 mg/kg, i.v. followed by infusion of 0.1 mg/kg/min, i.v.) 10 min prior to pns 2 and then received  xxxd2098xxx  (0.25 mg/kg, i.v.) 10 min
before pns 3; group i-d, cgp + fen: received cgp 20712a (3 mg/kg, i.v.) 10 min prior to pns 2 and then received  xxxd2098xxx  (0.25 mg/kg, i.v.)

portal vein nervous plexus stimulations
the mean arterial blood pressure, heart rate and basal
values of plasma noradrenaline levels within the control
group (s 1-3) did not significantly differ over the whole
experiment (table 2a, b, c). in addition, electrical stimulation of the portal vein per se did not cause any significant change in mean arterial blood pressure and heart
rate values (data not shown).
figure 2a shows the time-plasma level profile of noradrenaline in response to repeated local nerve stimulations (2 hz for 120 s at 30 min intervals) of the portal vein
nervous plexus from control pithed rats (group ii-a). the
calculated auc during 120 s for each nerve stimulation
episode of the portal vein (s 1 - 3) was not significantly
different over the whole experimental period (fig. 3 a).

effect of  xxxd2098xxx  (group ii-b). the mean arterial blood
pressure and heart rate during the first and the second
stimulation period did not differ significantly when compared to corresponding control values (group ii-a) (table 2a and b). injection of  xxxd2098xxx  (0.25 mg/kg, i.v.)
after the second stimulation period elicited similar car-

diovascular changes as those observed in the group i-b.
thus, the basal mean arterial blood pressure was reduced
about 33 °70 whereas the basal heart rate was increased by
119 + 18 beats/min (table 2 a, b).
the basal plasma noradrenaline levels as well as the
increase in plasma noradrenaline during s 1 and 2 were
not significantly different in comparison to corresponding values of the control group (table 2 c, fig. 3 b). addition of  xxxd2098xxx  after the second stimulation period
tends to increase the basal plasma noradrenaline level (table2c). the auc was enhanced by 110% when compared with the corresponding control value (fig. 3 b).

pressure, but did not prevent the increase in heart rate
elicited by  xxxd2098xxx  (0.25 mg/kg i.v.) added prior to s 3
(table 2a, b).

discussion

the pithed rat model enables pre- and postjunctional effects as well as interactions to be studied during baseline
conditions and during electrical stimulation of the whole
thoracolumbar sympathetic outflow without interference
of centrally mediated cardiovascular reflexes. in this experimental model, the plasma catecholamines have been
found to be proportional to the frequency of pns up to
2 hz (yamaguchi and kopin 1979). in addition, the blood

pressure response has been shown to be linearly proportional to the logarithm of the increase in plasma noradrenaline concentration during pns (yamaguchi and
kopin 1979). thus, increments in plasma noradrenaline
levels apparently are associated with proportional increments in noradrenaline release at vascular neuroeffector
junctions. for this reason, changes in plasma noradrenaline levels were used as an index of the amount of noradrenaline release from sympathetic nerve terminals.
recently, the influence of prejunctional fl-adrenoceptors on the noradrenaline release evoked by stimulation
of the nervous plexus of the portal vein, using a new technique with permanently cannulated freely moving rats,
was studied (remie and zaagsma 1986). in this experimental model, activation of prejunctional fl-adrenoceptors by the fl-agonist  xxxd2098xxx , caused a marked facilitation of the evoked noradrenaline release (remie et al.
1988 a). these findings were more pronounced than those
observed previously in vitro using the portal vein where
only a modest influence of the prejunctional fl-adrenoceptor mediated facilitation of sympathetic neurotransmission could be demonstrated (westfall et al. 1979; dah10f et al. 1980). in order to further elucidate this pronounced facilitating capacity of prejunctional fl-adrenoceptors on the stimulation-induced noradrenaline release,
the effect of  xxxd2098xxx  was studied on the increase in plasma noradrenaline evoked in response to pns of the whole
thoracolumbar sympathetic outflow and to local stimulation of the portal vein nervous plexus in the pithed rat
model.
in the present study,  xxxd2098xxx  significantly decreased
the basal blood pressure. this effect was blocked by the
selective  xxxd752xxx -adrenoceptor antagonist ici 118,551 (bilski
et al. 1983) but not by the highly selective fll-adrenoceptor antagonist cgp 20712a (dooley et al. 1986), suggesting that the observed decrease in basal blood pressure is
due to a vasodilatatory effect of  xxxd2098xxx  mediated by
postjunctional  xxxd752xxx -adrenoceptors. on the other hand, no
changes in the blood pressure responses to pns were observed in presence of  xxxd2098xxx , although the pns-induced plasma noradrenaline increase was markedly enhanced. it is likely, that the vasodilatatory effect of
 xxxd2098xxx  opposes and masks an enhancement of the aadrenoceptor-mediated vasoconstrictor effect of released
noradrenaline.
ici118,551 per se, had no effect on the blood
pressure response to pns whereas cgp 20712a significantly reduced the blood pressure response to pns. this
effect of cgp 20712a was not associated with a simultaneous reduction in pns-evoked increase in plasma noradrenaline. it is unlikely that a blunted heart rate response to pns in presence of cgp 20712a can explain
the decrease in blood pressure response, since it has been
shown that heart rate and blood pressure changes can occur independently in this type of preparation (gillespie et
al. 1970). on the other hand, it has been reported that fladrenoceptors of the flfsubtype mediate the release of
renin from the rat kidney (milavec-krizman et al. 1985).
furthermore, the pithed rat has raised plasma renin activity (de jonge et al. 1982) and probably raised plasma
 xxxg99xxx  (aii) levels which is due to stimulation of

576

intrarenal baroreceptors as a consequence of reduced basal blood pressure in this experimental model (keeton and
campbell 1980). thus, cgp 20712a might have attenuated blood pressure response to pns by blockade of renal
fll-adrenoceptors and subsequently decreased renin release and formation of the vasoconstrictor component
aii.
 xxxd2098xxx  has been reported to be a rather selective
 xxxd752xxx -agonist (minneman et al. 1979). at the dose used in
the present study, however,  xxxd2098xxx  markedly increased
the basal heart rate without a simultaneous increase in
the plasma levels of noradrenaline. this suggests that
fll-adrenoceptor activation also occurs, since activation
of cardiac  xxxd752xxx -adrenoceptors did not cause any major
inotropic or chronotropic responses in rats (bryan et al.
1981; juberg et al. 1985). accordingly,  xxxd2098xxx -induced
increase in basal heart rate was prevented by pretreatment
with cgp 20712a, but not by ici 118,551.
facilitation of noradrenaline release by/3-agonists has
been demonstrated in few in vivo experiments, i.e. in the
anaesthetized rabbit (majewski et al. 1982; schmidt et al.
1984) and in the pithed rabbit (schmidt et al. 1984) and
in in situ experiments in blood perfused gracilis muscle
(kahan and hjemdahl 1987; kahan et al. 1987b). in the
present study,  xxxd2098xxx  caused a pronounced enhancement of the increase in plasma noradrenaline levels evoked by pns as well as by local stimulation of portal vein
nervous plexus. the observed enhancement in a-na
could be assumed to be a consequence of a more rapid
diffusion from the synaptic cleft into the blood stream
due to the vasodilatation caused by the fl-adrenoceptor
agonist. this suggestion is less likely, however, since it has
been demonstrated that vasodilatation per se does not
enhance noradrenaline overflow (kahan et al. 1985).
in freely moving rats,  xxxd2098xxx  enhanced stimulationevoked release of noradrenaline from the portal vein sympathetic nerves by about 2.1 fold (remie et al. 1988). this
is identical to the facilitation observed in the portal vein
in this study using pithed rats in which centrally mediated
reflex mechanisms cannot interfere. thus, the present
findings obtained in the pithed animal model are in line
with previous results in the freely moving rat and lend
further support to the important role of a prejunctional
fl-adrenoceptor-mediated facilitatory control mechanism
of noradrenaline release from sympathetic varicosities.
attempts to elucidate the nature of the fl-adrenoceptor subtype mediating this process have yielded some inconsistent results. some studies using relatively selective
/?2 and /32 adrenoceptor agonists and antagonists have
suggested prejunctional fl-adrenoceptors to be of the
flz-adrenoceptor subtype (see majewski 1983), whereas
some suggested that they could be of the fl~ subtype
(majewski et al. 1980; dahlof et al. 1975). in the present
study, the facilitatory effect of  xxxd2098xxx  on the plasma
noradrenaline increase evoked by pns was completely
blocked by the flz-adrenoceptor antagonist ici 118,551,
but not by the fll-adrenoceptor antagonist cgp 20712a.
furthermore, in the presence of  xxxd2098xxx , the enhanced
increase in portal plasma noradrenaline evoked by nerve
stimulation of the portal vein was also completely blocked by ici 118,551. these findings strongly suggest that

prejunctional fl-adrenoceptors are mainly, if not exclusively, of the  xxxd752xxx -subtype and are supported by similar
findings in spontaneously hypertensive pithed rats
(borkowski and quinn 1984) and in portal vein from in
vitro (westfall et al. 1979; dahl6f et al. 1980) as well as
in vivo experiments (remie et al. 1988b).
[ci 118,551 per se caused only minor-significant reduction of both the pre- and the postganglionically evoked noradrenaline release. many experiments have failed to
show a reduced outflow of noradrenaline during nerve
stimulation in the presence of fl-adrenoceptor antagonists
(see dahlof 1981; misu and kubo 1986). adrenaline has
been suggested to be the major endogenous agonist for
the prejunctional fl-adrenoceptors (steenberg et al. 1983;
majewski and rand 1986; tarizzo and dahl6f 1989). accordingly, when the peripheral noradrenergic nerve terminals are loaded with adrenaline, propranolol becomes
more effective in reducing transmitter release elicited by
sympathetic nerve stimulation (guimarfies et al. 1978;
majewski et al. 1980, 1981). furthermore, majewski and
rand (1981) demonstrated that prejunctional fl-adrenoceptor-mediated facilitation of noradrenaline release is
inversely related to the degree of activation of prejunctional a-adrenoceptors which might partly explain the
lack of ability of fl-adrenoceptor antagonists to reduce
stimulation-induced noradrenaline release in the absence
of a2-adrenoceptor antagonists. in addition, a reduced
a-na response to pns by ici 118,551 administration
might be difficult to observe, since fl-blockade is known
to reduce the clearance of noradrenaline (majewski and
murphy 1989; keeton and biediger 1991).
in summary, the present study has shown in the pithed rat, i.e. an animal model where centrally mediated reflexes are not longer operative, that activation of the facilitatory prejunctional  xxxd752xxx -adrenoceptor-mediated control mechanism during both, pre- and postganglionic
stimulation of sympathetic nerves, induces a pronounced
enhancement of the noradrenaline overflow.
