summary:  xxxd204xxx , an antiarrhythmic agent with
structural similarities to lidocaine and procainamide, has
proved effective in treatment of patients with ventricular
premature depolarizations, ventricular tachycardia, and
supraventricular arrhythmias. while its effects at an
electrophysiologic level have been elucidated, its mecha-
nism of action at a biochemical level has remained largely
undefined. the data in this communication demonstrate
that  xxxd204xxx  inhibits the activation of bovine brain cyclic
3':5’-nucleotide phosphodiesterase ( xxxg1501xxx   xxxg1690xxx   xxxg1691xxx   xxxg1692xxx   xxxg1693xxx   xxxg1694xxx   xxxg1695xxx   xxxg1696xxx   xxxg1697xxx   xxxg1698xxx   xxxg1699xxx   xxxg1700xxx   xxxg1701xxx   xxxg1704xxx   xxxg1705xxx .17) by cal-
modulin. this inhibition is specific for the calmodulin-
stimulated enzyme, as no effect of  xxxd204xxx  is seen when
phosphodiesterase is assayed in the absence of calmodu-
lin. the inhibition is competitive with respect to substrate
( xxxd1773xxx ) and calmodulin concentrations. in the pres-

 xxxd204xxx  is an antiarrhythmic agent which has
been used in europe for almost a decade, although
it remains under investigational status in the united
states. the chemical structure of the drug, de-
picted in fig. 1, includes an aromatic ring, an in-
termediate chain, and a nitrogen atom with two
ethyl groups. the structure therefore bears some
resemblance to other antiarrhythmics, such as lido-
caine and procainamide. clinical studies demon-
strate that  xxxd204xxx  is effective in suppressing
ventricular premature depolarizations and ventricu-
lar tachycardia in patients with a variety of cardiac
diseases, including those in the immediate post-
myocardial infarction period. in many instances,
 xxxd204xxx  is effective in patients who have not
achieved a satisfactory response to presently avail-
able antiarrhythmic agents. in addition, this drug
has been used to treat supraventricular arrhythmias,
including supraventricular tachycardia in patients
with the wolff-parkinson-white syndrome, atrial
flutter, and atrial fibrillation (1).

ence of 10 nm calmodulin, the id, for  xxxd204xxx  is 18
um. this inhibition is not the result of  xxxd204xxx  acting as
a calcium chelator because increasing the calcium con-
centration does not reverse the inhibitory effect. aprin-
dine also inhibits calmodulin-stimulated ca-atpase (atp
phosphohydrolase  xxxg225xxx   xxxg265xxx   xxxg441xxx   xxxg621xxx   xxxg725xxx   xxxg726xxx   xxxg1213xxx   xxxg2173xxx   xxxg2174xxx   xxxg2428xxx .3) activity, but again has no
effect on the enzyme in the absence of calmodulin. ap-
rindine has hydrophobic properties which may be respon-
sible for the inhibitory effect. sufficient concentrations of
 xxxd204xxx  are achieved in myocardial tissues to interfere
with the ability of calmodulin to stimulate a number of
enzymes present in the heart. key words:  xxxd204xxx —
calmodulin—calcium—phosphodiesterase—ca-atpase—
antiarrhythmics.

myocardial depolarization involves complex
bidirectional fluxes of cations, primarily sodium,
potassium, and calcium. no direct evidence has
been provided that explains how  xxxd204xxx  func-
tions at a biochemical level, although previous
studies have examined the effects of this drug upon
electrical depolarization within various segments
of the heart.  xxxd204xxx  slows electrical conduc-
tivity through all cardiac tissues. in bovine pur-
kinje fibers it decreases the rate of rise of phase 0
depolarization and decreases the amplitude and
duration of the action potential (2). experiments ob-
serving the effect of  xxxd204xxx  on the action poten-
tial under conditions of variable calcium concen-
tration have implied that this drug may affect certain
calcium-dependent membrane processes (3).

calcium ions are critical in regulating a number
of biologic events, such as myocardial and skel-
etal muscle contractility, cell motility, microtubule
function, and neurotransmitter release. in most
circumstances calcium ions do not directly affect

enzymatic activity but require the interposition
of an intracellular calcium-binding protein (4).
calmodulin is a heat-stable protein of molecular
weight 16,700 which can reversibly bind calcium
and has been identified in all animal phyla and cell
types. in the presence of calcium it is known to
affect the activity of a number of enzymes, includ-
ing  xxxg1696xxx , ca-atpase,
myosin light chain kinase, phospholipase a,, and
phosphorylase kinase. in addition, it affects micro-
tubule aggregation, membrane protein phosphoryla-
tion, insulin release, and calcium transport (5,6).
the experiments reported in this communica-
tion were designed to determine if  xxxd204xxx  func-
tions at a biochemical level by influencing the
ability of calmodulin to activate calcium- xxxd2870xxx -
dent processes. specifically, the effect of  xxxd204xxx 
upon calmodulin-stimulated cyclic nucleotide phos-
phodiesterase and ca-atpase activities was tested.

materials and methods

purification of calmodulin

calmodulin was purified to homogeneity by affinity
chromatography over a fluphenazine-sepharose column
by the method of charbonneau and cormier (7). one
hundred grams of bovine brain was homogenized in 0.5 m
nacl, 5 mm  xxxg2125xxx ,, and 50 mm hepes, ph 7.0, and cen-
trifuged at 100,000 g for 1 h. the supernatant was directly
applied to a 150-ml column of fluphenazine-sepharose,
previously equilibrated with 10 mm hepes and 0.5 mm
 xxxg2125xxx ,, ph 7.0. the column was washed with 1.5 l of 0.5
m nacl in column buffer to remove extraneous proteins,
and the calmodulin was eluted with 10 mm tris, and 10
mm egta, ph 8.0. the purity of the calmodulin was
confirmed by sds polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.
aliquots were frozen at —70° and retained full activity for
at least 1 year.

preparation of
calmodulin-deficient phosphodiesterase
calmodulin-deficient phosphodiesterase was purified
from bovine brain by a modification of the method of
cheung and lin (8). thirty-five grams of tissue was
homogenized in 100 ml of 10 mm tris and 10 mm 2-
 xxxd26xxx , ph 8.0 (buffer a) with a tekmar tis-
sumizer at a setting of 90% for 15s x 2. the homogenate
was centrifuged at 40,000 g for 90 min and applied to a 1.5
x 45-cm column of deae cellulose (whatman de 52)
previously equilibrated with buffer a. the column was
washed with 200 ml of buffer a and the phosphodies-
terase eluted with a linear gradient of (nh,).so, from 0 to

0.5 m. the fractions rich in calmodulin-deficient phos-
phodiesterase were pooled, and the samples were frozen
at —70°.

preparations of membranes for atpase assay

human erythrocyte membranes for the atpase assay
were prepared by the method of jarrett and kyle from
recently outdated banked blood (9). washed erythrocytes
were lysed in 14 volumes of ice-cold distilled water and
stirred for 5 min. the membranes were collected by cen-
trifugation at 23,000 g for 10 min. the supernatant was
discarded and the pellet washed three times in 14 volumes
of 10 mm imidazole-hcl and 1 mm edta, ph 7.0, at 23°.
a final wash in 40 mm imidazole-hcl, ph 7.0, at 23°,
removed the edta.

phosphodiesterase assay

phosphodiesterase was assayed by the two-step
method of thompson et al. (10). 3h- xxxd1773xxx  was con-
verted by phosphodiesterase to 7#h-5'amp in a reaction
mixture containing 0.125 mm  xxxd1773xxx , 0.05 mm
 xxxg2125xxx ,, 5.0 mm mgcl, and 40 mm tris, ph 8.0, with a
total volume of 0.4 ml. this first reaction was stopped by
heating to 90° for | min and the 9h-5’amp converted by
an excess of 5’ nucleotidase (ophioghagus hannah snake
venom) to [*h]adenosine. the labeled product was sepa-
rated from substrate by adding 1.0 ml of a 1:3 slurry of
bio-rad 1 x 2 cl~ (200—400 mesh). the resin was pel-
leted by centrifugation at 2,000 rpm for 10 min, and the
radioactivity of the supernatant was determined. unless
otherwise specified,  xxxg2125xxx , was present at a final concen-
tration of 0.05 mm, and calmodulin, when added, was at a
final concentration of 10 nm. the effect of variable con-
centrations of  xxxd204xxx  (0q—200 4m) was determined in
the presence and absence of 10 nm calmodulin. all sam-
ples were assayed in duplicate, and the data reported are
the result of at least four independent observations. the
effect of variable concentrations of calmodulin was de-
termined at a constant concentration of  xxxd1773xxx  (0.125
mm) in the presence and absence of 30 um  xxxd204xxx . the
effect of variable  xxxd1773xxx  concentrations was deter-
mined at a fixed concentration of calmodulin (10 nm) in
the presence and absence of 30 4m  xxxd204xxx .

calcium atpase assay

as an initial step, mg-atpase activity was assayed by
incubating human erythrocyte membranes (0.3-0.5
mg/ml) in 100 mm nacl, 20 mm kcl, 0.5 mm egta, 3
mm mgcl,, 3 mm atp, 0.1 mm ouabain, and 40 mm
imidazole-hcl, ph 7.0, for 15 min at 37°. ouabain was
added to inhibit na-k— atpase activity. ca-atpase ac-
tivity was determined by subtracting mg-atpase activ-
ity from that of membranes assayed exactly as above,
except for the addition of 0.8 mm  xxxg2125xxx , (11). to deter-
mine the effect of  xxxd204xxx , the membranes were prein-
cubated on ice for 15 min with varying concentrations of
 xxxd204xxx , with or without added calmodulin (6.6 nm).
the reaction was stopped by the addition of 0.7 ml of 0.5
m h,so,, 0.5% molybdate, and 2% sds, followed by
0.02 ml of 1.2% sodium metabisulfite, 1.2% sodium sul-
fite, and 0.2% 1-amino-2-naphthol-4-sulfonic acid. the
color was developed for 30 min at 25° and inorganic phos-
phate determined by absorbance at 650 nm on a gilford
spectrophotometer. all samples were run in duplicate,
and the data reported are the result of at least four inde-
pendent experiments.

phosphodiesterase activity was determined as described in

 xxxg2125xxx ,. each point is the mean value of four experiments, and
vertical bars indicate sem. in the absence of calmodulin
(o---o),  xxxd204xxx  did not produce any significant alter-
ation in activity compared to that determined in the absence
of  xxxd204xxx . in the presence of 10 nm calmodulin (®@——®),
all samples with concentrations of  xxxd204xxx  =6 um were
significantly different from the activity in the absence of ap-
rindine (6 um, p < 0.05; 12-200 um, p < 0.001).

of calmodulin. basal phosphodiesterase activity
was 11.26 + 1.23 nmol/mg protein/min, while the
addition of 10 nm calmodulin stimulated enzymatic
activity approximately fivefold to 57.00 + 2.20
nmol/mg protein/min. in the absence of calmodulin,
 xxxd204xxx  had no effect on phosphodiesterase activ-
ity; however, in the presence of calmodulin, aprin-
dine caused a dose-dependent inhibition of the
phosphodiesterase activity. this inhibition was
statistically significant at  xxxd204xxx  concentrations
greater than or equal to 6 um (p < 0.05). the half
maximal inhibitory concentration (i[d;)) of aprin-
dine was 18 um.

in order to further investigate the mechanism of
inhibition by  xxxd204xxx , calmodulin-stimulated
phosphodiesterase activity was determined under
conditions of variable substrate ( xxxd1773xxx ) and
calmodulin concentrations. figure 3 is a double re-
ciprocal plot which illustrates that the inhibition by
30 um  xxxd204xxx  is competitive with respect to the
 xxxd1773xxx  concentration. similarly, fig. 4 demon-
strates that the inhibition by  xxxd204xxx  is competi-
tive with respect to the calmodulin concentration.
in each instance, the addition of 30 4m  xxxd204xxx 
resulted in a decrease in the binding affinity (an in-
crease in the kp) but no change in the maximal en-
zymatic velocity (vmax):

in all previous experiments the concentration of
 xxxg2125xxx , was 0.05 mm. to examine the possibility that
 xxxd204xxx  was acting simply as a calcium-binding
agent, the effect of the drug on calmodulin-
stimulated phosphodiesterase activity was deter-
mined in the presence of 0.05 mm or 3.00 mm  xxxg2125xxx ,
(table 1). the addition of  xxxg2125xxx , to a concentration

discussion

regulation of the calcium concentration in vari-
ous compartments within the cell is critical in
maintaining normal electrical conductivity and
contractile function of cardiac tissues. experimental
evidence supports the hypothesis that calcium re-
quires an intracellular receptor protein to modulate
cellular activities (4—6). calmodulin is a ubiquitous,
heat-stable protein of molecular weight 16,700
found in all animal phyla and cell types, including
myocardial tissues. calmodulin in the presence of
micromolar concentrations of calcium has been
shown to activate a number of enzymes and alter
calcium transport across erythrocyte membranes
and sarcoplasmic reticulum (13-22).

experimental data suggest that calmodulin func-
tions in the following manner:

ca?* + calmodulin > ca?+- calmodulin

ca?*- calmodulin + enzyme <> ca?*-calmodulin- enzyme
(inactive) (active)

 xxxd204xxx  inhibits the ability of calmodulin to stim-
ulate at least two of these calcium-dependent
enzymes— xxxg1696xxx  and
ca-atpase. an analysis of the mechanism by
which calcium and calmodulin affect enzymatic
function would suggest several sites at which aprin-
dine might potentially be interfering. a direct effect

 xxxd204xxx  concentration (um)

of  xxxd204xxx  on the unstimulated enzyme is
excluded by the observation that the drug has no
effect in the absence of calmodulin (figs. 2 and 5).
in addition, the data in table 1 demonstrate that
 xxxd204xxx  does not cause inhibition by functioning
simply as a calcium chelator. the inhibition by ap-
rindine of calmodulin-stimulated phosphodiesterase
activity is, however, competitive with respect to
both the concentration of substrate ( xxxd1773xxx )
and calmodulin.  xxxd204xxx  alters the binding affin-
ity but has no effect on vinax (figs. 3 and 4).

these data are quite analogous to the previous-
ly described effect of phenothiazines upon cal-
modulin-activated enzymes. in the present study,
the concentrations of  xxxd204xxx  necessary for 50%
inhibition (id,)) of calmodulin-stimulated phos-
phodiesterase and ca-atpase activities were 18
um and 84 um, respectively. these concentra-
tions of  xxxd204xxx  are nearly identical to those of
 xxxd3431xxx , which produce similar effects on
the same enzyme activities (23-25). as with aprin-
dine, a significantly higher concentration of tri-
fluoperazine is needed to produce a similar degree of
inhibition of ca-atpase than phosphodiesterase.
studies by levin and weiss have shown that
phenothiazines reversibly bind to the ca?’-
calmodulin complex. this binding inhibits the acti-
vation of a number of calmodulin-stimulated pro-
cesses, including phosphodiesterase and ca-
atpase (24,25).

more recent investigations have demonstrated
that the inhibition by phenothiazines may be less
specific than originally speculated. additional com-
pounds with hydrophobic characteristics have been
demonstrated to inhibit calmodulin-stimulated en-
 xxxg1282xxx  activation. binding of calcium to calmodulin

ence of 6.6 nm calmodulin (@——®),

exposes a domain with hydrophobic properties.
hydrophobic agents which bind to this region may
interfere with calmodulin-protein interactions
(26,27).

volpi et al. have previously reported that pro-
 xxxd3033xxx  and local anesthetics, such as  xxxd1869xxx ,
are antagonists of calmodulin (28).  xxxd204xxx , like
these other agents, has hydrophobic properties
which may be responsible for its ability to inhibit
calmodulin-stimulated enzymatic activity. how-
ever, several differences exist between the data of
volpi and those reported in this communication.
 xxxd204xxx  is a competitive inhibitor of calmodulin-
stimulated phosphodiesterase activity with respect
to both calmodulin and  xxxd1773xxx .  xxxd1869xxx , on
the other hand, is competitive with respect to cal-
modulin but noncompetitive with  xxxd1773xxx . in
addition, the id;) of  xxxd1869xxx  and propranolol is
180 um, while that for  xxxd204xxx  (18 4m) is an order
of magnitude lower.

in vivo, therapeutic doses of  xxxd204xxx  produce
plasma levels of approximately 1-3 pg/ml (3-9
pm). however, the drug is concentrated in myo-
cardial tissue, resulting in concentrations of 15—
100 g/g myocardium (29). if the in vitro data pre-
sented in this communication can be extrapolated
to the situation in vivo, sufficient concentrations
of  xxxd204xxx  are achieved within cardiac tissues
to significantly alter calmodulin-regulated events.

a number of the enzymes known to be activated
by calmodulin are present in myocardial tissue.
these include ca-atpase, phosphodiesterase, and
phosphorylase kinase. in addition, calcium uptake
into cardiac microsomes enriched with sarcoplas-
mic reticulum is stimulated by calmodulin (22). po-
tentially, each of these processes could be inhibited

by the presence of  xxxd204xxx  affecting calcium
transport, cyclic nucleotide levels, or the availabil-
ity of glucose for energy production. preliminary
experiments from this laboratory have shown that
 xxxd204xxx  does inhibit calcium transport into micro-
somes enriched with sarcoplasmic reticulum (30). in
the present study, the concentrations of calcium
utilized were sufficient to fully activate calmodulin.
further investigation in this area, such as employ-
ing lower calcium concentrations, may provide a
more precise understanding of the molecular phar-
macology of  xxxd204xxx  and other antiarrhythmic
agents.
