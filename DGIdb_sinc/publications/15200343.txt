abstract

rheumatoid arthritis (ra) is a chronic progressive inflammatory disease of
multifactorial aetiology. the pivotal role of proinflammatory cytokines in the
pathogenesis and perpetuation of synovitis has been demonstrated in basic
research since the late 1980s and in clinical research since the early 1990s.
biological agents are monoclonal antibodies or recombinant forms of natural
inhibitory molecules which selectively interact with molecules or cell receptors
affecting immune or inflammatory processes. in ra, etanercept, infliximab and
adalimumab are currently available to target  xxxg2296xxx  (tnf) and an
interleukin (il)-1 receptor antagonist is available to target il-1 activity. trials
have shown benefits as monotherapy, although the best results for disease control
are seen when biological agents are coadministered with methotrexate.
the use of these agents in clinical trials and in practice has resulted in dramatic
improvements in ra disease control, and delay and prevention of radiographic
damage. the remarkable benefits to patients in well-being, quality of life and
function, and the speed of onset of action are reminiscent of the early days of
corticosteroid use. ten years after the first clinical trials of anti-tnf therapies, the
adverse effect profile is evolving and includes, for anti-tnf therapy, an increased
risk of infections associated with immune suppression, injection and infusion
reactions, and a risk of drug induced autoimmune syndromes such as systemic
lupus erythematosus. where these drugs are affordable, the prognosis of individuals for control of severe ra is better than ever before. this manuscript summarises the clinical trial results and post-marketing information regarding the
biological agents currently in use for ra.

rheumatoid arthritis (ra) is a chronic inflammatory disease with multifactorial aetiology. the
pathophysiology of the disease is characterised by
the infiltration of immunocompetent cells into the
synovium, and stimulation and proliferation of synovial fibroblasts. antigen-activated t-cells infiltrate

the synovial membrane leading to a series of events,
including vascular and synovial proliferation, and
formation of pannus tissue, which invades and destroys articular cartilage and bone.[1] joint erosions
develop within the first year in 30%, and in 2 years
in 70% of patients.[2] more than 40% of patients

1268

with ra withdraw from the workforce within 4
years of diagnosis.[3] not only is there loss of quality
of life, but mortality is also increased in patients
with ra.[4]
conventional treatment with disease-modifying
antirheumatic drugs (dmards) in ra is unsatisfactory. a minority of patients achieve long-term
disease control or remission with a single dmard
and, in those with good control, the majority eventually discontinue therapy because of adverse effects
or loss of effectiveness after months or years. wolfe
et al.[5] reported the median time to treatment discontinuation to be 2 years using monotherapy with
 xxxd2301xxx  and gold, and under 5 years
using methotrexate. the most common reason for
treatment discontinuation was adverse effects. all
long-term studies have reported similar disappointing results when looking at adherence. remission is uncommon, regardless of treatment choice,
and as long as there are no cures, lifelong treatment
is needed. evolution of conventional dmard treatment has been in the direction of combination of
dmards, coadministration with low-dose prednisone, and initiation of treatment with effective
agents early in the disease process. these approaches have been evaluated in prospective controlled
trials, and results in terms of disease control in
appropriately screened patients are improved compared with traditional single-agent dmard
use.[6-11]
regardless of such incremental improvements,
conventional treatment of ra remained unsatisfactory until the advent of biological agents. biological
agents are monoclonal antibodies, or recombinant
forms of natural inhibitory molecules, which selectively target molecules or cell receptors affecting
immune or inflammatory processes. in ra, cytokines are the major targets of currently available
biological agents. there are many biological processes that might yield to this approach to therapy,
and numerous biological agents in every stage of
development and investigation. this article focuses
on those agents that are currently in use, their benefits, adverse effects, and the role and rationale for
their use in ra. as of april 2004, etanercept, inflix© 2004 adis data information bv. all rights reserved.

imab and adalimumab are available to target tumour
necrosis factor (tnf) action, and an interleukin
(il)-1 receptor antagonist ( xxxg1172xxx ) is available to
target il-1 activity.
1.  xxxg2296xxx  (tnf)alpha and
interleukin (il)-1
 xxxg2296xxx  and il-1 are major cytokines that are
found in increased levels in synovial fluid of patients with active ra. also found are increased
levels of natural inhibitors of tnf and il-1, including  xxxg1172xxx , soluble il-1 receptors and soluble tnf
receptors.[12-14]
 xxxg2296xxx  was discovered in 1975.  xxxg2296xxx  originates
as a precursor molecule in a variety of cells; in ra
the activated macrophage is the major cell of origin
of  xxxg2296xxx . the precursor is cleaved by  xxxg2296xxx -converting enzyme to a soluble fragment, which then
aggregates to trimolecular complexes of  xxxg2296xxx .
these complexes bind to receptor sites on fibroblasts, endothelial cells or other inflammatory cells.
the biological action of  xxxg2296xxx  is initiated by crosslinking of two receptors on a target cell.  xxxg2296xxx 
induces the production of other inflammatory cytokines, stimulates endothelial cells to express adhesion molecules that attract leucocytes into affected
joints, increases the rate of synthesis of metalloproteinases by synovial macrophages, fibroblasts,
osteoclasts and chondrocytes, and inhibits the synthesis of proteoglycans in cartilage.[15] the biological effects of  xxxg2296xxx  in human disease include fever,
tissue inflammation, shock and an increase in acute
phase proteins.
il-1 refers to a family of three cytokines comprising two agonists (il-1alpha and  xxxg1170xxx ) and one
antagonist ( xxxg1172xxx ). activated monocytes and
macrophages are the primary source of il-1alpha and
 xxxg1170xxx . these cytokines compete for the binding
sites on the il-1 receptor, which is found on the
outer membrane of rheumatoid synovial cells. these
cells are activated by binding of il-1 to its receptor,
and this results in cell activation, synovial inflammation, and bone and cartilage resorption. il-1 production is  xxxg2296xxx -dependent. blocking  xxxg2296xxx  with
neutralising antisera in ra synovial cultures leads to
drugs 2004; 64 (12)

reduced il-1 production within 3 days.[16]  xxxg1172xxx  is
a naturally occurring acute-phase anti-inflammatory
protein. it acts by blocking the binding of il-1 to its
receptor on the outer surface of rheumatoid synovial
cells and antagonises the effect of il-1.[17] greater
than 95% of receptor occupancy is required to block
il-1 signalling.
2. measurement of treatment effect,
function, quality of life and damage
the american college of rheumatology (acr)
and the world health organization have adopted a
core set of criteria to distinguish improvement of
arthritis activity in trials from placebo effects.[18] to
meet the acr definition of improvement, a patient
must achieve a minimum of 20% improvement in
tender and in swollen joint count, plus a 20% improvement in three of five of the following measures: patient global assessment, pain, physician
global assessment, patient-assessed disability by the
health assessment questionnaire (haq),[19] and
acute-phase reactants. recent trials have adapted the
acr criteria to define greater percentages of improvement of 50% and 70%. the haq disability
index is the arthritis-specific quality-of-life instrument most commonly used to measure functional
status.[19] it is scored on a scale of three units, with
higher numbers indicating increased disability. a
0.25 unit change in the haq is considered to be a
clinically significant change in the level of disability.[20] using the haq scores of 5012 ra patients,
wolfe and michaud[21] have calculated that a 0.25
unit increase in the haq is associated with a 10%
increase in work disability.[21]
in europe, the measurement which is most commonly used to define improvement and worsening is
the disease activity score (das). the european
league against rheumatism (eular) criteria defines improvement and disease control in terms of
measurement of change and level attained in the
das.[22] the das index is obtained using a formula
combining the tender joint count, swollen joint
count, patient global assessment and erythrocyte
sedimentation rate (esr) into a single number.[23]

the radiograph is regarded as the gold standard
to measure damage in ra. the two methods used to
score radiographic damage in most common use are
the larsen and the sharp scores.[24-28] the latter was
originally developed for the hands and was modified
by van der heijde et al.[29] to include the feet. both
methods provide a total score of damaged joints.
the larsen method assesses the amount of joint
damage with a single score per joint before totalling
over the joints and utilises standard radiographs for
comparison to establish the score in individual
joints. the sharp score grades erosions and jointspace narrowing separately in each joint, and totals
to a composite measure. erosions are scored from 0
to 5, and joint-space narrowing from 0 to 4. the
genant/sharp score is a modification of the sharp
scoring method that includes evaluation of 14 hand
joints for erosions and 13 hand joints for narrowing.
each joint is evaluated qualitatively for erosions on
a 0–3 scale and for narrowing on a 0–4 scale and
there are allowances for half grades to improve the
description. paired films, blinded to sequence, are
examined.[30]
3. biological agents targeting  xxxg2296xxx 
3.1 etanercept

there are two cell surface tnf receptors,  xxxd924xxx 
(55 kda) and p75 (75 kda), that mediate the activity
of tnf on effector cells. soluble tnf receptors
consist of the extracellular portions of the receptor,
which serve as physiological regulators of the inflammatory response by inhibiting tnf activity.
etanercept, a human tnf receptor p75 fusion protein, was developed to neutralise tnf activity in
ra. dna encoding the soluble portion of human
tnf receptor p75 was linked to dna encoding the
fc portion of a human igg1 molecule, and the
combined dna was then expressed in a mammalian
cell line.[31] the first reports of dose-finding studies
were published in 1996[32] and the first placebocontrolled trial was published in 1997.[31]
patients eligible for this trial had failed between
one and four dmards, had a 1-month dmardfree washout, and had a minimum of ten swollen

in a 6-month trial comparing twice weekly subcutaneous injections of etanercept 10mg, etanercept
25mg and placebo, the primary endpoints were
acr20 and acr50 improvements at 3 and 6
months.[33] inclusion criteria included failure of between one and four dmards, a minimum of ten
swollen joints and either 45 minutes of morning
stiffness or elevated  xxxg520xxx  (crp) or
esr. patients enrolled had a mean of 25 swollen
joints at baseline and 80% were rheumatoid factor
(rf) positive. ninety percent had previously received methotrexate. mean esr was 40mm. improvement was rapid. by 2 weeks, 32% of the

months, there was a 58% reduction in swollen joint
count at the 16 mg/m2 twice weekly dosage, compared with a 24% reduction in patients assigned to
placebo (figure 1) the tender joint count was also
reduced to a greater extent by etanercept 16 mg/m2

percent of patients achieved acr20 by 1 month and
57% achieved acr50 by 3 months, compared with
20% and 7%, respectively, for placebo. cessation of
therapy caused an increase in disease activity, confirming that continued administration of etanercept
is necessary to sustain the therapeutic effect.

pared with 1% of the placebo patients. by 3 months,
the mean number of swollen joints had fallen by
47% in the etanercept 25mg group compared with
1% of placebo-treated patients. by 3 months, 62%
of the etanercept 25mg group had achieved acr20,
41% had achieved acr50 and 15% had achieved
acr70; these responses were maintained at the
6-month assessment. in etanercept-treated patients,
esr fell from a mean of 35mm at baseline to 15mm
at 6 months, compared with an increase from 39mm
at baseline to 53mm at 6 months in placebo-treated
patients. fifty-three percent of placebo-treated patients withdrew prematurely because of lack of effect compared with 15% of those who received
etanercept 25mg (p < 0.001). the impressive results
in terms of quality of life are illustrated in figure 3.
there were statistically significant and clinically
important improvements in general health status,
arthritis-specific health status, vitality and disability
indexes, each of the subscales of the haq, and in
the mental health domain.
in the etanercept in early rheumatoid arthritis
trial (era), etanercept was compared with methotrexate in a double-blind, randomised controlled
trial which enrolled patients with ra for <3
years.[34] this study was designed to evaluate radiographic progression as well as clinical outcomes.
consequently, inclusion criteria were developed so
that patients at high risk of disease progression
would be enrolled and the duration of the trial was

12 months. eligible patients were required to have a
positive rf, or at least three erosions on hand and
feet radiographs and an elevated esr or crp or 45
minutes of morning stiffness. the rate of progression of erosions estimated based on the degree of
radiographic damage and the duration of ra at
baseline and assuming no treatment for a year, was
4–5 points per year. this is equivalent to five new
erosions per year, or the erosion of 80–100% of one
joint per year, or complete loss of the joint space in a
single joint per year. no patient had received prior
methotrexate, and there was a 4-week washout for
other dmards. methotrexate dosage was escalated
to 15mg per week by 4 weeks and 20mg per week by
8 weeks, with adjustment permitted for toxicity such
that ultimately the mean methotrexate dosage was
19mg per week orally, given with placebo injections. the etanercept patients received either 10 or
25mg twice per week subcutaneously. baseline disease characteristics of enrolled patients included:
positive rf in 88%; average disease duration of 12
months; mean of 24 swollen joints; 86% had erosions; and 40% were taking prednisone at a mean
daily dose of 7mg for the methotrexate-treated patients and 9mg for those randomised to etanercept

group had achieved acr50 compared with 40% of
the methotrexate group (not significant). although
results for etanercept were superior in a number of
measures, and although the benefits of etanercept
were evident earlier, the era trial has been interpreted by many to highlight the effectiveness of
methotrexate therapy using rapid dose escalation in
early ra.

in the era trial involving 632 ra patients, there
were two deaths: one in the etanercept 10mg group
from metastatic lung cancer after 2 months and one
in the etanercept 25mg group from ruptured aortic
aneurysm.[34] there were three cases (1%) of methotrexate pneumonitis, and nausea occurred in 29% of

evaluation of radiographic progression showed
that there was a difference in the rate of erosion
development comparing methotrexate and etanercept 25mg, which was evident by 6 months of
therapy. over the initial 6 months, mean increase in
erosion score was 0.3 in etanercept 25mg recipients
and 0.68 in the methotrexate-treated group. in the
methotrexate group, the rate of change in erosion
slowed during the second 6 months compared with
the first 6 months. mean changes from baseline in
erosion scores and total damage scores are illustrated in figure 5. during the second 6 months of
therapy, the rate of change in erosions was similar in
the groups assigned to methotrexate and etanercept.
at 6 months, the mean total score on the sharp scale
had increased by 0.57 in the etanercept 25mg group
and by 1.06 in the methotrexate group (p = 0.001),
and the respective increases were 1 and 1.59 at 12
months. comparing methotrexate with etanercept
25mg, the rate of erosion development represents
one new erosion each year on methotrexate and one
every 2 years on etanercept, with the differences
most evident during the first 6 months of therapy. of
interest, the majority of patients did not develop new
or worsening erosions. over 1 year of treatment,
72% of patients receiving etanercept and 60% of
patients receiving methotrexate did not have any
erosion progression (p = 0.007). changes in jointspace-narrowing scores were no different comparing the two groups at 6 and 12 months.

etanercept added to methotrexate resulted in improvement in all acr response criteria at 24
weeks.[35] at 6 months, acr20 was achieved by
71% of patients in the etanercept plus methotrexate
group compared with 27% in the placebo plus
methotrexate group. acr50 and acr70 were
achieved by 39% and 15%, respectively, in the
etanercept/methotrexate group versus 3% and 0% in
the methotrexate/placebo groups. median number of
swollen joints fell from 20 to 7 in those taking
etanercept/methotrexate, compared with a change
from 17 to 11 in patients taking methotrexate/placebo (figure 6). the benefit of adding etanercept to
methotrexate partial responders or nonresponders
was rapid. at every evaluation, beginning at week 1,
a significantly greater proportion of patients receiving the combination achieved acr20. by 4 weeks,
the benefit in terms of acr50 was statistically
significant; at 3 months the difference in acr70
responses was significantly different comparing the
combination with methotrexate/placebo. the time
course and extent of improvements are illustrated in
figure 6. the median disability index score from the
haq improved over 24 weeks from 1.5 to 0.8, an
improvement of 47%, in patients receiving etanercept/methotrexate, compared with 27% in the
methotrexate/placebo group. injection site reactions

because of differences in patient population, trial

compare effectiveness of therapy. table i illustrates
these important differences between trial populations in terms of disease duration and activity as well
as methotrexate dose at baseline.

recipients.
in october 2002, kremer et al.[39] reported the
results of median 4-year follow-up in 79 of 89
patients who had been enrolled in the earlier trial of
etanercept added to methotrexate.[35] at the time of
reporting, 64 of 79 patients remained on therapy; the
authors noted reduction or discontinuation of
methotrexate treatment in 55%, and of corticosteroids in 82% of patients. in 42 patients who had
completed 4 years of treatment, 12% had achieved
acr70, 28% had no tender joints and 20% had no
swollen joints.[39] withdrawals during the median
4-year follow-up were because of lack of efficacy in
three patients, adverse effects in four, patient’s decision in five, and miscellaneous in three patients.
patients who entered the era trial,[33] 161 randomised initially to etanercept and 143 randomised
initially to methotrexate, were followed up at 4
years. after 4 years of continuous etanercept therapy, radiographic progression was 0.9 sharp units in
the first year, 0.57 sharp units in the second year and
0.37 sharp units in the third year.[40]
3.2 infliximab

infliximab is a chimeric human/mouse monoclonal anti- xxxg2296xxx  antibody consisting of the constant
region of human igg1 coupled to the fv region of a
high-affinity neutralising anti-human  xxxg2296xxx  antibody. infliximab binds to both soluble and transmembrane forms of  xxxg2296xxx . binding to soluble
 xxxg2296xxx  results in loss of bioactivity; binding to membrane-bound  xxxg2296xxx  leads to cell death by complement- and/or antibody-dependent cell-mediated
mechanisms.[41] pharmacodynamic effects and effects on inflammatory cytokines, lymphocyte migration and neovascularisation have been previously
reviewed.[42]
the first studies of use of infliximab in ra were
published in 1993.[43] twenty patients with active
ra were treated in an open-label, phase i/ii trial
with infliximab 20 mg/kg as a single dose; impressive benefits were measured at 6 weeks. a placebodrugs 2004; 64 (12)

receiving etanercept plus methotrexate compared with placebo plus
methotrexate during the study by weinblatt et al., 1999[35] (reproduced from weinblatt et al.,[35] with permission from the massachusetts medical society).

controlled trial comparing single doses of infliximab
10 mg/kg with 1 mg/kg and with placebo in 93
patients confirmed these early results.[44] a subsequent controlled trial aimed to establish the optimum dose and the benefits and adverse effects of
repeated infusions of infliximab with and without
methotrexate versus placebo added to methotrexate.[45]
one hundred and one patients entered this multicentre, 26-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled
trial, which compared infliximab at doses of 1, 3 or
10 mg/kg with or without methotrexate, with placebo plus methotrexate.[45] infusions of infliximab/
placebo were administered at 0, 2, 6, 10 and 14
weeks, and final assessment was done at 26 weeks.
enrolled patients had been receiving methotrexate
for a minimum of 6 months at a dosage of 7.5–15mg
per week. median swollen joint count at baseline
ranged between 16 and 20 for the seven treatment
groups, and median esr ranged from 44 to 60mm.
the best outcomes were seen in patients randomised
to infliximab 3 or 10 mg/kg together with weekly
methotrexate. clinical response, measured by paulus 20% improvement and 50% improvement, respectively, were 40% and 40% for the 3 mg/kg dose,
and 38% and 42% for the 10 mg/kg dose. discontinuations in the infliximab plus methotrexate
groups were for lack of effect in one patient at the 10

mg/kg dose, and adverse effects in one patient at the
10 mg/kg dose. there were three remissions in 28
patients assigned to infliximab 3 or 10 mg/kg. median swollen joint counts fell from 15 to 4 on the 3
mg/kg dose, and from 18 to 6 on the 10 mg/kg dose,
both doses given with methotrexate. seven patients
withdrew, five of these because of infusion reactions. twenty-eight of 87 patients (32.2%), who
received infliximab in any dose, developed infections that required treatment with antibacterials,
compared with 3 of 14 infections in patients receiving placebo plus methotrexate (21.4%). two infections were serious: one bacterial endophthalmitis
after cataract surgery 9 weeks after the fifth
dose of infliximab 3 mg/kg; and one death from
staphylococcal septicaemia and septic shock, 15
weeks after the third infusion of infliximab 10 mg/
kg. anti-dna antibodies developed in 8% of patients, without symptoms of lupus. human antichimeric antibodies (haca) occurred in 21% of
infliximab 3 mg/kg recipients and 7% of infliximab
10 mg/kg recipients who did not receive methotrexate, and in 7% and 0%, respectively, who did receive
methotrexate. the apparent synergy of the action of
infliximab plus methotrexate was suggested to be
partly based on decreased immunogenicity of infliximab as manifested by reduced haca in those
taking concomitant methotrexate.
following this successful short-term trial, infliximab was evaluated in a 54-week, multicentre study
involving 428 patients with active ra despite at
least 12.5mg of methotrexate per week. the first
analysis of clinical outcomes was done at 30 weeks
and reported in december 1999.[36] outcomes at 54
weeks, which included evaluation of radiographic
damage, were reported in 2000.[46] in this trial, commonly named attract (anti-tumour necrosis
factor trial in rheumatoid arthritis with concomitant therapy), patients were randomised to one of
four doses of infliximab or to placebo. mean duration of disease ranged from 9 to 12 years in the
various treatment groups. baseline disability and
radiographic scores of patients in attract indicate that patients had very severe ra with fairly
extensive joint damage at baseline. of all the recent

scores occurred in 39–55% of infliximab-treated
patients versus 14% of methotrexate-treated patients. the results in terms of radiographic outcomes
are illustrated for methotrexate/placebo and methotrexate/infliximab in figure 7.
infections requiring antibacterial therapy developed in 35% of patients receiving methotrexate and
in 44% of those receiving infliximab plus methotrexate. thirty-four percent of patients receiving infliximab/methotrexate developed upper respiratory infections versus 22% of those receiving placebo/
methotrexate. seventeen percent of infliximab/
methotrexate recipients developed sinusitis compared with 6% of those receiving placebo/methotrexate. neither deaths nor cancer incidence were increased in the infliximab/methotrexate-treated patients compared with placebo/methotrexate-treated
patients over the 54-week course. autoantibodies

trials reporting radiographic outcomes, attract
enrolled a group which is distinguished by the extent
of radiographic destruction at baseline. approximately 80% were positive for rf and mean esr
was 50mm. at baseline, mean methotrexate dosage
was 15mg weekly. all dosages of infliximab were
effective in terms of acr20, acr50 and acr70 at
30 weeks. all dosages of infliximab resulted in
improvement in haq scores. baseline and 30-week
outcome measures for the 3 mg/kg every-8-week
dosage are included in table i and table ii. acr 20%
improvement was seen in 50% of patients who received 3 mg/kg every 8 weeks and in 50% of those
receiving 10mg/kg every 8 weeks. acr 50% improvement was seen in 27% and 31% of those who
received 3 or 10 mg/kg every 8 weeks, respectively.
there appeared to be a dose-response effect in terms
of improvement in clinical and laboratory outcomes.
acr50 response rates were significantly higher in
the groups receiving infliximab 3 mg/kg every 4
weeks (34.1%), 10mg/kg every 8 weeks (40%) and
10 mg/kg every 4 weeks (37.5%) than in the group
receiving 3mg/kg every 8 weeks (21.5%). at a dosage of 10 mg/kg every 4 weeks there was a 63%
reduction in swollen joints and a 65% reduction in
tender joints, compared with 50% and 55% for 3
mg/kg every 4 weeks, and 37% and 49% for 3 mg/
kg every 8 weeks. at the 3 mg/kg dose every 8
weeks, 73% of patients completed the 54 weeks
compared with 86% at the 10 mg/kg dose every 8
weeks. a more recent analysis of data from attract explored further the issue of optimal dosage.[47] st clair et al.[47] hypothesised that inadequate responses at the 3 mg/kg every 8 weeks dosage is likely to result from incomplete suppression
of  xxxg2296xxx . in analysing serum samples from attract patients receiving infliximab 3 mg/kg every
8 weeks, 22–30% of serum samples had undetectable trough concentrations of infliximab prior to
infusions at weeks 22–54. furthermore, the authors
reported that joint damage prevention was superior
in patients with higher serum infliximab trough concentrations.

3.3 adalimumab

adalimumab is the first fully human (100%
human peptide sequences) anti- xxxg2296xxx  monoclonal
antibody to be investigated for the treatment of ra.
early trials enrolled patients with long-standing disease refractory to several conventional dmards
and active ra manifested by a das >3.2. the first
clinical trial randomised 120 european patients to a
single intravenous dose of adalimumab varying
from 0.5 to 10 mg/kg; these patients were evaluated
weekly for 1 month.[48] benefit was noted between 1
and 7 days after treatment and peaked between 1 and
2 weeks. within the month, 28% of patients who
received either 5 or 10 mg/kg achieved an acr50
response at one or more weekly assessments. in 61%
of patients the benefit from a single intravenous
injection lasted 29 days or longer. this was followed
by an open-label phase of treatment during which
injections were administered at intervals that were
adjusted according to the das. patients received
injections when the das rose above 2.4. following
this regimen, the mean adalimumab dose interval
was 2.5 weeks. response, defined as a reduction of
1.2 in the das, was achieved by 80% of patients.
swollen joint count and tender joint count were
reduced by 60%. ten percent of patients discontinued adalimumab because of lack of effect in six,
adverse effects in five and patient request in one
patient. in a subset of 66 patients with a 12-year
history of ra, radiographs showed no change in
sharp score over 12 months.[49,50] in 36 patients with
radiographs at baseline and after 2 years of treatment, 42% receiving adalimumab monotherapy
showed no increase in joint damage.[51]
de007 was a randomised, double-blind, placebocontrolled trial involving 283 european patients designed to evaluate varying dosages of adalimumab
monotherapy (20, 40 and 80mg subcutaneously
every 2 weeks) compared with placebo over 12
weeks.[49] adalimumab resulted in an acr20 response in 49% of patients receiving the 20mg dose,
57% of those receiving the 40mg dose and 56% of

those receiving the 80mg dose, compared with 10%
of placebo/methotrexate recipients. the 40mg and
the 80mg dose were equally effective and the 20mg
dose less effective.
the 24-week north american de009 anti-tnf
research study program of the monoclonal antibody adalimumab (armada) phase ii/iii trial
involved 271 patients with a mean disease duration
of 12 years, 81% of whom were rf-positive. it
compared adalimumab in varying doses with placebo, both added to methotrexate (mean dosage 16.8
mg/week).[37] baseline and outcome measures are
included for the 40mg every 2 weeks dosage in table
i and table ii. mean baseline swollen joint count was
17.3 in these patients who had received a mean of
three previous dmards and were partial responders to methotrexate. by 1 week after initiation of
treatment, 17% of patients receiving the adalimumab 40mg dose had achieved an acr20, compared
with 4% of placebo-treated patients. by week 24,
mean swollen joint count in patients receiving
adalimumab 40mg every 2 weeks with methotrexate
was seven. crp fell from mean of 2.1 to a mean of
0.5 mg/l. at week 24, acr20 response was
achieved by 65.7% of patients receiving the 40mg
dose and 65.8% of those receiving the 80mg dose
with methotrexate, compared with 14.5% for placebo/methotrexate recipients. acr50 responses were
achieved by 53.7% at the 40mg dose compared with
8.1% in the placebo/methotrexate group. acr70
responses were seen in 26.9% of patients taking
adalimumab 40mg with methotrexate, and in 4.8%
of placebo/methotrexate recipients. injection site reactions were reported by 1.5% of adalimumab-treated patients compared with 3.2% of placebo-treated
patients. infections occurred at a rate of 1.38 per
patient per year in placebo/methotrexate-treated patients, and 1.55 per patient per year in adalimumab/
methotrexate-treated patients. pneumonia occurred
in two adalimumab/methotrexate recipients who remained in the trial. discontinuation because of adverse effects occurred in five patients receiving
adalimumab/methotrexate (injection site plus other
cutaneous reactions in four, cough and asthenia in
one) and two receiving placebo/methotrexate. of

3.9% became positive for ana (anti-double stranded dna antibodies), whereas none of those receiving placebo/methotrexate did.
3.4 long-term safety of anti-tnf therapy

the evaluation of long-term safety requires observation of patients followed according to normal
practice for a minimum of 5 years. such data are not
yet available. typically, industry-sponsored clinical
trials select for patients with high disease activity
but exclude those with potentially serious co-morbid
conditions and serious rheumatoid extra-articular
involvement. therefore, safety results from trials
may not translate into safety in practice. there is a
sparse literature on safety of anti-tnf therapy as it
is used in the community. selected safety data from
trials and published observational cohort studies are
summarised here. information from the us fda
march 2003 update on the safety of new drugs for
ra[52] is included for completeness.
four-year safety data for 64 patients from the
era trial were recently reported.[40] this population
of patients with disease duration averaging 12
months does not compare with those who were
enrolled in attract[36,46] or with other observational cohorts with more severe long-standing disease and co-morbidity. infection requiring intravenous antibacterial therapy or hospitalisation occurred at a rate of 0.05 per patient in year 1, and 0.02
per patient in year 4. no cases of tuberculosis (tb)
or opportunistic infections developed during 4 years
of follow-up of era trial patients who continued on
etanercept. safety results of all patients who had
participated in etanercept trials in north america
and europe have been reported in abstract form.[53]
the report included data on 1442 patients in north
america and 612 in europe, encompassing 5547
patient-years. the incidence of infection requiring
intravenous antibacterials or hospitalisation was
0.04 per patient-year.
phillips et al.[54] performed a retrospective review
of 180 patients who were started on etanercept between december 1998 and april 2000. 144 of 180
patients had ra and 56% were receiving  xxxd1751xxx © 2004 adis data information bv. all rights reserved.

steroids; 26% discontinued etanercept – 2.9% because of serious adverse events, most commonly
infections; there were two deaths resulting from
infection. phillips et al.[54] considered that anti-tnf
therapy might have contributed to infectious complications, including two cases of septic arthritis and
a case of psoas abscess caused by mycobacterium
avium intracellulare complex.
upper respiratory infections and sinusitis were
increased in trial patients receiving infliximab in
attract.[36,46] although the incidence of serious
infections in attract was not significantly increased, infections were more common in the 10
mg/kg dose groups. in the second 6 months of the
trial, two deaths occurred: one from disseminated
tb and one from coccidioidomycosis. among 1897
patients followed in infliximab trials, 4% developed
one or more serious infections compared with 7%
reported in placebo-treated patients.[55]
an observational cohort included 529 belgian
patients who had received infliximab 3 mg/kg every
8 weeks for 1 year up until january 2002. serious
infections developed in 7.1% of patients.[56] these
included two cases of tb; there were three deaths
from pneumonia, endocarditis and multifocal leukoencephalopathy. fitzcharles et al.[57] reported the
results of 9 months of experience in 41 patients who
had received a total of 300 infliximab infusions
between june 2000 and january 2002. seventy-three
percent of this population had ra, 68% were taking
concomitant corticosteroids and 54% were receiving
methotrexate with infliximab. three patients experienced anaphylactic reactions occurring between the
second and eighth infusions and two developed cutaneous leukocytoclastic vasculitis. one-third of patients developed minor allergic-type reactions, including rash and itching. twenty-nine percent experienced an infection requiring antibacterial
therapy, and one developed histoplasmosis.
post-marketing surveillance by the us fda
identified an increased risk of tb and of infections
normally associated with immunosuppression in patients receiving all tnf-blocking agents.[52,58,59] as
of march 2003, there were 38 reports of tb in
230 000 patient-years (150 000 patients) with etandrugs 2004; 64 (12)

biological agents for rheumatoid arthritis

ercept, 172 cases in 230 000 patient-years (200 000
patients) with infliximab, and 13 cases in 4900
patient-years (2500 patients) with adalimumab.[52]
the majority of cases have developed in european
patients prior to recommendations for tb screening,
and the majority are a result of reactivation of latent
infections. however, it is evident that the increased
risk of tb is a class effect, and that screening is not
identifying all individuals at risk. extrapulmonary
involvement including dissemination has been reported in between 40% and 50% of tb cases (compared with 18% in the general population with tb)
and also appears to be a class effect of anti-tnf
therapy. tnf plays an important role in containment
of tubercle bacilli, probably by enhancing macrophage function and granuloma formation. thus, inhibition of tnf may facilitate reactivation of tb.
the reason for an excess of tb cases in infliximabtreated patients is partly because of the fact that the
earlier trials and greater experience with infliximab
has been in europe, where the prevalence of latent
tb is also greater. furthermore, it is possible that
the effect of the monoclonal antibody causing lysis
of cells critical to granuloma formation confers added risks for reactivation.
screening for latent tb infection with purified
protein derivative of mycobacterium tuberculosis
(ppd) should be recommended for all patients considered for anti-tnf therapy. in patients with documented previous infection or positive skin testing,
tb prophylaxis is recommended. continuous vigilance for tb with atypical presentation is required.
other opportunistic infections occurring in patients receiving either infliximab or etanercept have
included infection with pneumocystis jiroveci (previously p. carnii), aspergillus spp., cryptococci,
coccidioides immitis and atypical mycobacterium.
experience with adalimumab suggests a similar profile of infectious complications.
placebo-controlled trials of etanercept and infliximab aimed at improving outcomes of congestive
heart failure have been prematurely discontinued
because of a trend towards worsening of heart failure, including hospitalisation and mortality.[52] this
has not been observed in ra clinical trials.

concerns have been raised by post-marketing
surveillance regarding other potential risks of antitnf therapy, including cases of demyelinating disease possibly triggered by anti-tnf therapy and rare
reports of drug-induced lupus. while there is no
doubt that the latter does occur rarely, all the reported cases have reversed with discontinuation of antitnf therapy and serious sequelae have not been
seen. regarding demyelinating disease, there remains uncertainty whether the incidence in ra patients receiving anti-tnf drugs is higher than the
incidence in a matched population without drug
exposure; furthermore, there has been no reassurance that cases that develop while patients are receiving anti-tnf drugs are reversible. in january
2003, the us fda published reports of 26 cases of
lymphoma: 18 in patients taking etanercept and
eight in patients taking infliximab at a median of 6
weeks after initiation of treatment.[60] subsequent to
submission of this report and prior to its publication
in january of 2003, there were 75 further reports of
lymphomas possibly related to anti-tnf therapy.[60]
two individuals with previously treated lymphoma
in remission at the time of initiation of anti-tnf
therapy quickly developed recurrence of lymphoma
and died. on the basis of these two cases, the us
fda report suggests that ra patients with a history
of lymphoma should be ineligible for anti-tnf therapy. to date, the relationship of lymphoma development with epstein-barr virus has not been adequately explored. furthermore, the us fda cannot draw
firm conclusions regarding a relationship to drug
exposure because there is an increased incidence of
lymphoma in patients with ra.
4. biological agents targeting il-1
4.1 anakinra

the objective of  xxxg1172xxx -based therapy is to occupy enough il-1 receptors to block il-1 cell signalling.[61] anakinra is a recombinant form of the
human  xxxg1172xxx . it is a 17.3 kda protein of 153
amino acids produced through recombinant dna
technology using an escherichia coli bacterial expression system.[14] its spectrum of biological efdrugs 2004; 64 (12)

1280

fects is identical to that of the human  xxxg1172xxx . it acts
as a competitive receptor antagonist, inhibiting
binding of il-1alpha and  xxxg1170xxx  to the il-1 receptor.
tissue effects of anakinra include reduction of synovial t-lymphocyte and macrophage numbers, and
levels of vascular endothelial cell adhesion molecules. pharmacokinetic studies in ra patients demonstrate a mean elimination half-life of 7 ± 2.3
hours.[14]
the effectiveness of anakinra administered as a
daily subcutaneous injection has been studied as
monotherapy and in combination with methotrexate.
a 24-week, randomised controlled trial in 472 patients evaluated varying dosages of anakinra; results
demonstrated efficacy in terms of acr20 in 43% of
ra patients receiving anakinra 150mg daily versus
27% of placebo recipients (p = 0.014), and improvement in each individual acr core outcome.[61] response occurred early: the rate of decrease in clinical
endpoints was greatest during the first 6 weeks and
the greatest fall in crp was observed in the first
week of therapy. dosages under 30 mg/day were
ineffective. statistically significant improvement in
the haq disability index was seen by 4 weeks. over
the course of 24 weeks, the haq disability index
improved from 1.3 to 0.93 in the 75 mg/day dosage
group and from 1.3 to 0.79 in the 150 mg/day dosage
group (fixed doses). the trial continued into extension for a further 24 weeks in 229 patients randomised to anakinra 30, 75 or 150 mg/day.[62] forty-six
percent of patients who continued anakinra, at all
dosages, demonstrated a sustained acr20 response
at 48 weeks. at 48 weeks, an acr50 response was
seen in 18% and an acr70 in 3% of completers.[62]
after 48 weeks, the benefit of anakinra (all dose
groups combined) included a 45% reduction in erosion count measured by the larsen method, but the
change in the total larsen score was not statistically
significant.[63] in patients initially randomised to
placebo for 24 weeks, the introduction of anakinra
was associated with a statistically significant 50%
slowing of damage progression when the genant
method was used, but this benefit was not shown
using the larsen score. productivity over a
12-month period was evaluated using a self-admin© 2004 adis data information bv. all rights reserved.

istered questionnaire. after 6 months of treatment
with anakinra 150 mg/day, patients had gained more
productive days (mean 15.66) compared with placebo (3.55) [p < 0.05], but this benefit was not seen at
the 30 or 75 mg/day dose.[64]
the effectiveness of anakinra added to baseline
methotrexate (mean weekly dose 15–25mg) was
studied in 419 patients randomised to varying dosages of anakinra or placebo.[38] patient characteristics, baseline and 24-week outcome measures are
included in table i and table ii for the 1 and 2 mg/kg/
day dosage of anakinra. acr20 response at week 12
for anakinra/methotrexate combination therapy was
higher than for placebo/methotrexate for all dosages
of anakinra: 46% for 1 mg/kg/day versus 19% for
placebo/methotrexate (p = 0.001). acr50 responses
at 24 weeks were 24% for the 1 mg/kg/day dosage
and 17% for the 2 mg/kg/day dosage compared with
4% in the placebo group. for the individual acr
endpoints, the 2 mg/kg/day dosage showed greater
benefit at 24 weeks compared with the lower dosages. the improvement in swollen joint count was
not statistically significant at either the 1 or 2 mg/kg/
day dosage compared with placebo or baseline. the
1 mg/kg/day dosage of anakinra added to methotrexate showed statistically significant improvement in
terms of all other measures except morning stiffness, number of tender joints, pain and crp. the 2
mg/kg/day dosage showed statistically significant
benefit in all measures except swollen joints, tender
joints, morning stiffness and crp.
lack of effect was the stated reason for withdrawal prior to 24 weeks in 4% of the patients
receiving the 1 and 2 mg/kg/day dosage and in 5%
of placebo-treated patients. injection site reactions
occurred in 56% of patients receiving the 1 mg/kg/
day dosage and 64% of patients receiving 2 mg/kg/
day, resulting in withdrawal in 7% and 10%, respectively, compared with 3% in the placebo group.
there was no increase in the rate of infection and no
serious infections. five anakinra-treated patients developed leukopenia that normalised when anakinra
was discontinued and was not associated with infection.

4.2 safety of il-1 receptor antagonists

during a 6-month, placebo-controlled, doubleblind trial of  xxxg1172xxx ,[61] and its 48-week extension,[62] the most common adverse effect was injection site reaction resulting in withdrawal of approximately 15% of patients during the first 24 weeks.
the most common symptoms were erythema, pruritus and rash.[61] use of  xxxg1172xxx  as monotherapy or in
combination with methotrexate has not been associated with an increased risk of infection or with
opportunistic infections. in contrast, combined treatment with anakinra and etanercept in 58 patients
was associated with a 7% incidence of serious infections requiring hospitalisation and a 48% incidence
of infection.[65]
5. conclusion
there is ongoing debate as to the optimal role of
biological agents in the treatment of ra. should
these agents be used early to prevent damage or
should they be used in patients who have failed
methotrexate or multiple dmards, which is the
population that has received the most study to date?
the greatest cost of ra is in work loss and the
greatest financial and societal benefit will be in
prevention of work loss. in a swedish study, patients
who remained in the workforce and were in parttime employment at the start of infliximab or etanercept therapy achieved an increase in weekly hours of
work.[66] the number of hours per week worked was
8.55 prior to treatment and this increased to 20 hours
by the end of 2 years. the authors calculated an
annual indirect economic benefit based on this gain
in work hours amounting to $us10 600 (2002
value). complete cost-effectiveness studies based
on differing treatment strategies will be needed.
the recent availability of these biological agents
to treat ra has raised our expectations and the
expectations of patients for control of ra.[28] benefits, in terms of quality of life and functional improvement, are of a measure and speed which has
not been seen since the discovery of cortisone. studies extending to 2 years have demonstrated the ability of these products to prevent joint damage in
severe ra. these improvements are so great, in

trials and in practice, that the acr is having to
revisit its measurements in ra, and the us fda is
rewriting definitions of ra medications in terms of
symptom control, disease control and damage prevention. radiographic measurements in ra must be
reassessed to determine that they are able to measure
healing as well as harm. undoubtedly, the benefits
of biological agents have translated into clinical
practice and, where these drugs are affordable, the
outlook for people with this disease is changed.
experience has shown that with anti-tnf therapies,
vigilance for common bacterial and opportunistic
infection is mandatory.
