background and purpose: the parp inhibitor  xxxd2774xxx  is currently tested in clinical phase 1 trials to deﬁne
safe dose levels in combination with rt. however, certain clinically relevant insights are still lacking.

radiosensitization by  xxxd2774xxx 

currently tested in several clinical phase 1 trials. a number of
pre-clinical studies have shown that  xxxg1667xxx  inhibition leads to
effective radiosensitization in multiple models [11–14]. radiation
induces dna lesions that require  xxxg1667xxx  activity for repair.
consistent with a cytotoxicity that is mediated by replication stalling or dsb conversion upon replication, radiosensitization by
 xxxg1667xxx  inhibitors is greater in proliferating cells [15,16] and in
cells with vulnerabilities associated with dsb repair [17].  xxxg1667xxx 
inhibition therefore provides an opportunity for tumor-speciﬁc
radiosensitization in repair-defected and highly proliferating
tumor cells.
a challenge in the clinical development of combination strategies with targeted agents, such as  xxxd2774xxx , concerns the optimal
dose of the targeted agent [3,18,19]. the optimal dose of a
radiosensitizer is the dose resulting in maximum tumor-speciﬁc
radiosensitization. it therefore depends on both tolerability and
efﬁcacy of the combination treatment. notably, as the underlying
mechanisms of the activity as radiosensitizer or as single agent
may differ, also tolerability and effectivity, and thus the optimal
dose, may differ.
despite extensive studies showing the radiosensitizing potential of parp inhibitors, clinically relevant questions remained
unanswered with respect to the effective dose as radiosensitizer:
which  xxxd2774xxx  dose is needed for radiosensitization, is it different
in different genetic backgrounds, and how does the dose compare
to the effective dose as single agent? in this study, we evaluated
the inﬂuence of  xxxd2774xxx  dose, radiation dose and the hr status
of tumor cells on the extent of  xxxd2774xxx -mediated radiosensitization and compared effective doses of  xxxd2774xxx  as radiosensitizer
to effective doses as single agent.

doubling times in the continuous presence of  xxxd2774xxx . as parp
inhibition can affect metabolic activity, a non-metabolic growth
assay read out was chosen. cell numbers and survival were determined by quantifying the dna content using the cyquant cell
proliferation assay kit (invitrogen). dmso treated controls were
plated at different cell densities to evaluate linearity of the assay
i.e. the sub-conﬂuent state of cell cultures when assayed. growth
inhibition was monitored as a decrease in ‘‘viability’’ determined
by dividing the cell number values of the treated samples by those
of the controls.
clonogenic survival assay
proliferating cells were irradiated after a 1 h  xxxd2774xxx 
pre-incubation. six hours thereafter, cells were trypsinized, plated
in appropriate cell densities and cultured with or without  xxxd2774xxx 
for at least 6 doubling times to allow colony formation. colonies
were ﬁxed and stained with 0.5% crystal violet/6.0% glutaraldehyde
and counted. surviving fractions (sf) were calculated by dividing
the plating efﬁciency of treated samples by the plating efﬁciency
of control samples.
parp pharmacodynamic assay

materials and methods

cellular levels of par (poly-adp-ribose, the direct product of
 xxxg1667xxx ) were measured by using the ht parp in vivo
pharmacodynamic assay ii (trevigenò) following the manufacturer’s protocol. cells were cultured and irradiated on ice at a
sub-conﬂuent state after 1 h of  xxxd2774xxx  pre-incubation. after cell
extract preparation and protein content determination (bca protein assay, thermoscientiﬁc), par levels were measured by chemiluminescent readings using a tecan plate reader.

reagents

data analysis and statistics

 xxxd2774xxx  was provided by astrazeneca. stock solutions were
prepared in dimethylsulfoxide (dmso) at a concentration of
10 mm. dmso concentrations were equalized in all treatments
and doses including the control cells without  xxxd2774xxx .

clonogenic survival values (sfs) and growth inhibition values
(viability) were normalized to either non-radiated controls or to
dmso controls (without  xxxd2774xxx  treatment) as indicated. sfs on
radiation survival curves were ﬁtted using the linear quadratic
(lq)-model (sf = exp( ad bd2); d = radiation dose). for growth
inhibition assays, the area under the curve (reﬂecting mean
inactivation doses) of these ﬁts from 0 to 6 gy (auc0–6gy) was calculated for each individual experiment. the radiation dose resulting in 37% survival was calculated from the lq ﬁts for each
 xxxd2774xxx  dose in each individual experiment. the radiation dose
enhancement factor (def) of  xxxd2774xxx  is the ratio of the radiation
doses resulting in 37% survival in control samples to  xxxd2774xxx 
treated samples.
statistical analyses were performed in graphpad prism
using student’s t-test (two-sided) and considered signiﬁcant if
p-value < 0.05.

cell culture
the mouse mammary tumor cell lines kb2p3.4 with homozygous deletion of the brca2-gene (here referred to as
brca2-deﬁcient) and kb2p3.4r3 with complemented brca2
(brca2-complemented) were cultured at 37 °c, 5% co2 and 5%
o2 in medium as described previously [20].
the human hnscc cell lines ut-scc-12a, ut-scc-20a,
ut-scc-24b, ut-scc-30, ut-scc-45 and ut-scc-60b were kindly
provided by dr. grenman (turku university central hospital,
finland) and cultured as described previously under low oxygen
(4%) in dmem medium (invitrogen) [21]. note, that these lower
than generally applied but more relevant oxygen levels may have
an impact on parp inhibitor sensitivity.

results
brca2-deﬁcient cells are hypersensitive to  xxxd2774xxx  and to radiation

radiation
cells were exposed to single radiation doses (0.5–6 gy) at a
dose rate of 1 gy/min using the gammacellò 40 exactor (best
theratronics ltd., ottawa, ontario, canada). control cells were
sham-irradiated.
long term growth inhibition assay
proliferating cells were treated with various concentrations of
 xxxd2774xxx  1 h prior to irradiation and further cultured for at least ﬁve

to evaluate all main factors that potentially affect the ability of
 xxxd2774xxx  to radiosensitize cells, we used two isogenic cell lines that
differ in their hr status. the brca2-deﬁcient cells derived from a
spontaneous tumor mouse model that drives brca2 loss in mammary cells and are hr-deﬁcient and (p53 / ) [22]. as its
hr-proﬁcient counterpart we used the same cell line in which
brca2 function was restored by genetic complementation
(brca2-complemented) [20]. firstly, we assessed sensitivity to
radiation and to  xxxd2774xxx  in this model. consistent with previous
reports [20,23–25], the brca2-deﬁcient cells were hypersensitive

to  xxxd2774xxx  with an ic50 (i.e. concentration resulting in 50% survival) of 16 nm, whereas the ic50 was not yet reached at 3.3 lm
 xxxd2774xxx  in the brca2-complemented cells (fig. 1a).
brca2-deﬁcient cells also conﬁrmed to be more sensitive to radiation than brca2-complemented cells by a def37 of 2.1 [26,27]
(fig. 1b, supplemental table 1).
 xxxd2774xxx  radiosensitizes brca2-proﬁcient and deﬁcient cells to
different extent
we wished to test a wide range of  xxxd2774xxx  doses combined with
different radiation doses. to do so, we performed long-term
growth inhibition assays in which brca2-deﬁcient and
brca2-complemented cells were continuously exposed to  xxxd2774xxx .
we acknowledged the potential interference of parp inhibition in
cellular metabolic activity and hence applied an assay based on a
dna content read out. in both cell lines, the combination of  xxxd2774xxx 
and radiation killed cells more effectively than either alone
(fig. 2a and b, supplemental fig. 1a and b). the combination
resulted in an additive or more than additive kill, hence radiosensitization, as shown in the survival curves derived after normalization to non-radiated controls at the respective  xxxd2774xxx  doses
(fig. 2c and d, supplemental fig. 1c and d). to compare the extent
of radiosensitization in the two cell lines, the area under the curve
(auc) and dose enhancement factors (def37) were calculated on
the linear quadratic ﬁts (fig. 2e and f). the overall lower auc
values reﬂect the increased intrinsic radiosensitivity of the
brca2-deﬁcient cells (fig. 1b). in both cell lines, the auc decreased
and the def increased with increasing  xxxd2774xxx  dose, showing
the radiosensitization dependence on  xxxd2774xxx  dose. notably,
brca2-deﬁcient cells were radiosensitized at more than ten-fold
lower concentrations than brca2-complemented cells (fig. 2f
and supplemental table 2; with 8 nm and 220 nm for a def of 1.3
respectively). we conclude that  xxxd2774xxx  effectively radiosensitizes
both hr-deﬁcient and hr-proﬁcient cells, however, the  xxxd2774xxx 
dose needed for radiosensitization is lower in hr-impaired cells.
7 h exposure to  xxxd2774xxx  is sufﬁcient to radiosensitize
as the highly cytotoxic effect of  xxxd2774xxx  as single agent in
hr-deﬁcient cells may mask the full radiosensitization potential
of  xxxd2774xxx , we reduced  xxxd2774xxx  exposure time from continuous
to 7 h (1 h before and 6 h after irradiation). this reduction in  xxxd2774xxx  exposure signiﬁcantly reduced cell kill (single agent effect)
in the brca2-deﬁcient cells (supplemental fig. 2). in combination
with radiation, a short exposure time to  xxxd2774xxx  killed cells more
effectively than either alone in both cell lines fig. 3a and
supplemental fig. 2). at the lower radiation doses radiosensitization was more pronounced in the short than in the continuous
exposure schedule (supplemental fig. 3), thereby partly compensating for the loss of single agent activity ( xxxd2774xxx  cytotoxicity)
in the short exposure schedule. we conclude that 7 h exposure to
 xxxd2774xxx  is sufﬁcient to radiosensitize.
extent of radiosensitization depends on  xxxd2774xxx  dose and brca2
status
in both, brca2-deﬁcient and brca2-complemented, cells
radiosensitization increased with increasing  xxxd2774xxx  dose
(fig. 3a, supplemental fig. 3a and b). to compare radiosensitization effects at different  xxxd2774xxx  doses, dose enhancement factors
(def) at 37% survival were calculated from the clonogenic
assay data. these data show that brca2-deﬁcient cells are
radiosensitized by much lower doses of  xxxd2774xxx  than
brca2-complemented cells, after both, short and continuous,
exposures to  xxxd2774xxx  (fig. 3b, supplemental fig. 3c–e and table 1).

effective doses for radiosensitization are lower than for single agent
activity
to compare effective doses of  xxxd2774xxx  as radiosensitizer with
effective doses as single agent directly, surviving fractions (sf)
were normalized to radiated controls without  xxxd2774xxx . lower
doses of  xxxd2774xxx  were needed for radiosensitization than for single
agent activity in both cell lines and for short and long exposures
(fig. 3c and d, supplemental fig. 4). in the 7 h exposure schedule,
effective single agent activity doses in brca2-deﬁcient cells are
around 1000 nm (with an ic50 of 3500 nm, supplemental
table 2), whereas doses as low as 3 or 33 nm achieve signiﬁcant
radiosensitization. brca2-complemented cells showed a radiation
dose dependent increase in the extent of radiosensitization by  xxxd2774xxx  (fig. 3c). in contrast, brca2-deﬁcient cells were sensitized by
just 0.5 gy. increasing the radiation dose did not increase the
extent of radiosensitization further (fig. 3d). together, we conclude that the extent of radiosensitization by  xxxd2774xxx  depends
on the  xxxd2774xxx  and radiation dose and the cellular repair status.
as we show here, this is the case at schedules that result in high
single agent activity, but also when  xxxd2774xxx  is applied shortly,
(with little single agent activity). importantly, effective doses of
 xxxd2774xxx  for radiosensitization are much lower than for single
agent activity.

 xxxd2774xxx  prevents par induction upon irradiation at radiosensitizing
doses
radiation effectively induces par, the direct product of  xxxg1667xxx 
[28]. a different par response could be the underlying cause of the
different radiosensitization doses in the two cell lines. to date, it is
not known at which  xxxd2774xxx  concentration parylation (i.e.
par-formation), induced by radiation, can be prevented. in order
to test par induction in the context of radiation/parp inhibitor
combinations, we applied a quantitative elisa based assay on
lysates of treated cells. radiation alone induced par in both cell
lines similarly (fig. 4). despite the observed differences in the sensitivity to  xxxd2774xxx  as single agent, we show that  xxxd2774xxx  resulted
in a comparable dose dependent decrease in par levels in these
cells (fig. 4, supplemental fig. 5) indicating that  xxxd2774xxx  activity
is similar. notably, at concentrations that radiosensitized
brca2-deﬁcient (but not brca2-complemented) cells,  xxxd2774xxx 
prevented par induction by radiation in both cell lines similarly
(fig. 4). thus, consistent with the observed radiosensitization
potential, our results show that  xxxd2774xxx  effectively abolished
radiation-induced parylation at very low drug concentrations,
whereas baseline par levels were not yet fully abolished.

radiosensitization by  xxxd2774xxx  in a panel of human hnscc cell lines
to further validate the results of the isogenic brca2 mouse
tumor cell model, we next tested a panel of human head and neck
squamous cell carcinoma (hnscc) cell lines. these hnscc cell
lines differed in their sensitivity to  xxxd2774xxx  as single agent
(fig. 5, 0 gy). all hnscc cell lines were radiosensitized by  xxxd2774xxx 
(as shown by the normalized values in fig. 5 and by the def37 in
supplemental fig. 6). table 1 summarizes the overall radiosensitization effect by listing the def37 that were achieved at the tested
 xxxd2774xxx  concentrations in the different cell lines.  xxxd2774xxx 
enhancement factors (ola-ef) were calculated from the growth
inhibition curves by comparing the ic50 values in the unirradiated
controls to those derived from the radiation normalized curves.
they demonstrate that  xxxd2774xxx  activity was ‘‘radiation enhanced’’
in a radiation dose dependent manner. consistent with our previous results, the  xxxd2774xxx  concentration at which radiosensitization
occurred, was about 2–100 fold (average of 30-fold in the hnscc)

lower than the concentration at which single agent activity
occurred. we deﬁned a def of 1.3 as a robust radiosensitization
in our models and compared the  xxxd2774xxx  dose that is required to
achieve this extent of radiosensitization across the tested cell lines
(supplemental table 2 and supplemental fig. 7). these doses were
in general much lower than the  xxxd2774xxx  ic50s. this pattern was
observed in all cell lines, with the exception of ut-scc-45 that
showed both, radiosensitization and single agent activity, at very
low doses. the extent of radiosensitization increased with
increasing radiation dose. with these data we show that the
effective doses of  xxxd2774xxx  as radiosensitizer are consistently
lower than the effective doses as single agent in all analyzed
cell lines.

discussion
in this study we show that the extent of radiosensitization by
the parp inhibitor  xxxd2774xxx  depends on radiation and  xxxd2774xxx  dose
and on the hr status of the cells. we further showed that  xxxd2774xxx 
radiosensitizes at much lower doses than needed for single agent
activity.
this difference in effective doses (for radiosensitization and for
single agent activity) has important clinical implications since this
suggests radiosensitization activity at very low dose levels.
monotherapy phase i trials have deﬁned a maximum tolerated
dose (mtd) for  xxxd2774xxx  of 400 mg bi-daily (in the capsule formulation) [8], a dose applied in consecutive trials to demonstrate

table 1

single agent tumor activity [7,9,10]. combination treatments that
assessed the safety of  xxxd2774xxx  with chemotherapeutics have, however, been challenging and were not able to achieve such high

doses [29–32]. our ﬁndings, however, would indicate that much
lower doses than administered in monotherapy are needed to
achieve activity in combination with rt combination. as a

c.v.m. verhagen et al. / radiotherapy and oncology xxx (2015) xxx–xxx

reference, clinical plasma concentrations of  xxxd2774xxx  found at
monotherapy mtd would translate into a 5000–14,000 nm concentration range [8]. we conclude that three quarter of the tested
cell lines are efﬁciently radiosensitized at a 3–10-fold lower dose
than this monotherapy mtd. considering available patient pharmacokinetic data [8], and dependent on the scheduling and the
genetic tumor background one could expect radiosensitization
around a 10–20 mg  xxxd2774xxx  dose level (capsule) based on our data.
there is some evidence suggesting that parp inhibitors such as
 xxxd2774xxx  accumulate in tumor cells, indicating that even lower
doses may be sufﬁcient [33,34]. comparing  xxxd2774xxx  concentrations in resected breast cancer tumors and corresponding plasma
samples at the time of surgery, bundred et al. found that on
average, tumor concentrations were approximately 41% of plasma
concentrations (range, 5–154%) [35]. notably, they found signiﬁcant  xxxg1667xxx  inhibition in tumors of patients receiving only
10 mg  xxxd2774xxx  bi-daily [35]. this further supports a low dose
activity (also fig. 4) that may be fully exploited in the radiation setting. often, clinical combination studies aim to achieve monotherapy doses and schedules that showed single agent efﬁcacy,
assuming that the needed target inhibition is similar. however,
here we show that efﬁcacy in combination with radiation, efﬁcient
radiosensitization, could be reached at different i.e. lower doses.
the rational of combining parp inhibitors with radiation is
based on a potential tumor-speciﬁc activity that derives from the
reported pronounced radiosensitization in replicating tumor cells
and in dna repair and dna damage response impaired cells
(figs. 1–3, [13,15–17]) and from the potential to exploit or alter
hypoxia [14,36]; all attributes that are inherent to tumor cells
[37]. despite this potential tumor selectivity, however, our data
further call for careful dose escalation in phase i rt combination
trials. considering the potent low  xxxd2774xxx  dose activity one should
anticipate a similar pattern in concomitantly radiation induced
normal tissue toxicities.
 xxxd2774xxx  single agent activity on tumor cell kill requires a
long-term, continuous exposure to the drug ([34], supplemental
fig. 2b). to fully take advantage of the potential single agent tumor
activity, monotherapy trial designs should provide a continuous
exposure at high doses of the drug. however, here we show that
for the establishment of efﬁcient radiosensitization short exposures are sufﬁcient and at low radiation doses this may partly compensate for the lack of cytotoxicity by  xxxd2774xxx  itself (table 1,
supplemental tables 1 and 2). with this and good tumor pk/pd
kinetic data at hand, one will be able to design sensible schedules
that would optimize the timing of rt and drug administration.
we observed that the low parp inhibitor doses that decreases
par formation only partially at unchallenged conditions (i.e. unirradiated), however, efﬁciently abrogate par formation even at
higher radiation doses (fig. 4 and supplemental fig. 5). our data,
thus, suggest that the lower dose requirement for radiosensitization is due to this increased requirement of parp activity after
radiation. mechanistically, this may also explain the radiation dose
dependence as induced par levels depend on radiation dose.
variability in par formation capacity, drug transport and drug activation efﬁciencies, together with genetic background differences
may likely cause the wide range of radiosensitizing  xxxd2774xxx  doses.
ultimately, however, this lack of par formation affects dna damage repair and is thought to cause double strand breaks by conversion from single strand breaks or trapped parp molecules during
replication. it should also be noted that the continuous treatment
schedule most likely affected replication in the  xxxd2774xxx  sensitive
cell lines and therefore partly compromised the full radiation
effect.
together, our study highlights that the optimal biological dose
of a targeted agent in combination with radiation can greatly differ
from the optimal biological dose used as single agent and further

7

illustrates the relevance of such investigations. alongside with
the guidelines for development of radiosensitizers [38] we thus
also recommend to deﬁne optimal dosing for radiosensitization.
in particular when radiosensitization occurs at very low doses as
shown here, our study also stresses the need of robust and sensitive (pharmacodynamic) biomarkers in the clinic that in contrast
to the monotherapy setting reﬂect the altered radiation response
well.
