■ abstract  xxxg1660xxx ,  xxxg2276xxx , and tryptophan
hydroxylase constitute a small family of monooxygenases that utilize tetrahydropterins as substrates. when from eukaryotic sources, these enzymes are composed
of a homologous catalytic domain to which are attached discrete n-terminal regulatory domains and short c-terminal tetramerization domains, whereas the bacterial
enzymes lack the n-terminal and c-terminal domains. each enzyme contains a single
 xxxd2385xxx  atom bound to two histidines and a glutamate. recent mechanistic studies have begun to provide insights into the mechanisms of oxygen activation and
hydroxylation. although the hydroxylating intermediate in these enzymes has not
been identified, the iron is likely to be involved. reversible phosphorylation of serine
residues in the regulatory domains affects the activities of all three enzymes. in addition,  xxxg1660xxx  is allosterically regulated by its substrates, phenylalanine and tetrahydrobiopterin.

introduction
hydroxylation of an aromatic ring is a fundamental reaction in biology. it occurs
frequently in the activation of compounds during catabolism and in the biosynthesis of natural products. not surprisingly, organisms have developed several
methods of catalyzing such a reaction. among the most common are the
cytochrome p-450–dependent hydroxylases and the flavoprotein phenol hydroxylases. because of the ubiquity of these two families of enzymes, their mechanisms and structures have been the subjects of extensive studies. these
investigations have been greatly aided by the absorbency properties of the tightly
bound heme and flavin cofactors in these enzymes and by relevant chemical studies of model compounds. in contrast, the small group of enzymes that utilize a
tetrahydropterin substrate to catalyze the hydroxylation of an aromatic ring has
seen significantly less study, owing to a combination of the difficulty of obtaining the proteins and the lack of a convenient chromophore. still, the last few
years have seen a significant increase in our understanding of the mechanistic
and regulatory properties of this family of enzymes.
the reactions carried out by the three members of this group are illustrated in
figure 1.  xxxg1660xxx  catalyzes the formation of tyrosine; mutations in this enzyme are the most common cause of phenylketonuria. tyrosine
hydroxylase catalyzes the formation of  xxxd2471xxx , the first step in
the biosynthesis of the catecholamine neurotransmitters. tryptophan hydroxylase catalyzes the formation of 5-hydroxytryptophan, the first step in the biosynthesis of the neurotransmitter serotonin. these enzymes are monooxygenases,
incorporating one atom of oxygen from molecular oxygen into the substrate and
reducing the other atom to water. the two electrons required for the reduction of
the second atom to water are supplied by the tetrahydrobiopterin (bh4) substrate.
it should be emphasized that, in contrast to hemes and flavins, tetrahydropterins
act as substrates rather than tightly bound cofactors, binding and dissociating
each turnover.
 xxxg1660xxx  is present at relatively abundant levels in liver.
this enzyme has also been isolated from at least two bacterial strains (1, 2). both
tyrosine and tryptophan hydroxylase are found in the central nervous system.
 xxxg2276xxx  is also present in the adrenal gland, a common source of
the naturally occurring enzyme. there are reports of a bacterial tryptophan
hydroxylase (3), but this has not been characterized.
as shown in figure 1, the pterin product of the reactions catalyzed by these
enzymes is a hydroxypterin. this was first established with phenylalanine
hydroxylase (4), but more recently has been shown to be the case with the other
two enzymes (5–7). with  xxxg1660xxx  the stereochemistry of the
hydroxypterin has been established as s at the hydroxyl (8). the hydroxypterin
rapidly dehydrates in solution (9); the resulting quinonoid dihydropterin can be
reduced to the tetrahydropterin by the pyridine-nucleotide-dependent enzyme
 xxxg1912xxx  (10).

structure
primary structures
comparison of the amino acid sequences of the enzymes from a variety of
eukaryotic sources readily establishes the structural similarities of the three
hydroxylases. there are differences in lengths: rat  xxxg1660xxx 
has 453 amino acid residues if the n-terminal methionine is counted, rat  xxxg2276xxx  has 498 residues, and rat tryptophan hydroxylase has 444
residues. there are also some species-specific differences in size. all three
enzymes are composed of an n-terminal region, the length and sequence of
which is specific for the specific enzyme, and a highly conserved c-terminal
region (figure 2). the conserved c-terminal region begins at a valine 118 of rat
 xxxg1660xxx , 164 of rat  xxxg2276xxx , and 105 of rat tryptophan hydroxylase. the c-terminal 334–339 amino acid residues of the eukaryotic enzymes are highly conserved such that these regions can be aligned with
no gaps. the two bacterial phenylalanine hydroxylases that have been described
lack the n-terminal region; that from pseudomonas aeruginosa contains 264
residues, beginning at residue 157 of the rat sequence (11), whereas that from

chromobacterium violaceum contains 280 residues, beginning at residue 144
(12). alignment of the bacterial enzymes with the conserved c-terminal regions
of the eukaryotic enzymes also requires that several gaps be introduced into the
bacterial sequences (11). in addition, the bacterial enzymes lack 25–30 residues
found at the c termini of the eukaryotic enzymes. there are no similarities
between the c-terminal 38 amino acid residues of the bacterial phenylalanine
hydroxylases and the eukaryotic enzymes (11, 13).
alternative splicing of mrna can generate four different forms of human
 xxxg2276xxx ; all of the differences are in the n-terminus (14–16). the
differences in the sequences of these proteins are shown in figure 3. isoform
hth1 corresponds to the rat enzyme. the other three isoforms contain insertions
between methionine 30 and serine 31 of hth1. as discussed below, serine 31 is
phosphorylated as part of the regulation of  xxxg2276xxx ; changes in the
amino acid sequence immediately preceding this residue would be expected to
affect its recognition by specific protein kinases (14).
the sequence similarities were detected after the first few members of this
family had been sequenced, and these similarities led to the proposal that the
c-terminal portions of all three enzymes were homologous, arising from a common ancestor, and represented the catalytic core (17). the amino terminal regions
were proposed to be responsible for substrate specificity (18). studies of trun-

remainder of the sequences are identical. hyphens indicate deletions. the phosphorylated serine residues are indicated in bold.

cated eukaryotic enzymes have supported the concept of a common catalytic core.  xxxg1660xxx  lacking 141 n-terminal residues or 43 cterminal residues retains catalytic activity (19), tryptophan hydroxylase lacking
as many as 106 n-terminal residues (20) and as many as 28 c-terminal residues
(7) retains activity, and  xxxg2276xxx  lacking 157 n-terminal residues or
43 c-terminal residues retains catalytic activity (21). the correspondence
between the sequences of the bacterial phenylalanine hydroxylases and the smallest active versions of the eukaryotic enzymes further supports identification of a
common c-terminal catalytic core.

three-dimensional structures
the eukaryotic hydroxylases are all homotetramers (22–24), although  xxxg1660xxx  readily forms dimers (22, 25). deletion of residues from the ntermini does not alter the quaternary structures (26–28), whereas further removal
of 20–43 residues from the c-termini converts the enzymes to monomers (7, 19,
29, 30). bacterial  xxxg1660xxx , which lacks both regions, is
monomeric (1, 2). although the c-terminal 20 amino acid residues are not conserved in the eukaryotic enzymes, they all contain hydrophobic residues at the
first and fourth positions of each seven-residue sequence. based on these results,
the c-terminus of each subunit has been proposed to form a helix; packing of the
helices from four subunits would be responsible for the tetrameric structure of
these enzymes (30, 31).
the three-dimensional structures have been determined for human  xxxg1660xxx  lacking the first 102 and the last 25 residues and for rat
 xxxg2276xxx  lacking the first 155 residues (32, 33). neither structure
contains bound substrates or inhibitors. the two structures are essentially identical, with a root mean square deviation of only 0.66 å for the ca atoms. consistent with previous studies of the quaternary structures of these enzymes,

 xxxg1660xxx  is a dimer in the crystals, whereas  xxxg2276xxx  is tetrameric. figure 4 shows the overall structure of the  xxxg2276xxx  tetramer. as predicted from mutational and proteolytic studies, the
primary tetramer interface is a 24-residue a-helix at the c-terminus.  xxxg1660xxx  remains a dimer owing to additional interactions involving
residues 401–420.
in the absence of bound substrates or inhibitors, the active site can be tentatively identified from the location of the iron atom. this assignment is supported
by the results of martinez et al (34–36), who used the paramagnetic effects of
the metals in tyrosine and  xxxg1660xxx  to show that both the aromatic ring of the amino acid substrates and the tetrahydropterin bind closely to
the metal. in both structures the iron is located in a hydrophobic cleft 10 å from
the surface. the surface of this cleft is made up primarily of four helices containing mostly hydrophobic residues, consistent with the hydrophobic nature of
the substrates. there is a short loop, which covers the entrance to the active site,
containing residues 378-381 in  xxxg1660xxx  and 427–429 in  xxxg2276xxx . binding to rat  xxxg1660xxx  of an antibody

raised to a synthetic peptide corresponding to residues 263–289 is prevented by
dihydropterin (37); this peptide contains 10 residues found in the proposed
active site cleft (32), further supporting the assignment of the active site to the
cleft containing the iron.
the roles of the majority of the individual active-site residues have not been
established. the structure of the iron site in  xxxg2276xxx  is shown in
figure 5. there are three amino acid ligands to the metal, histidines 331 and 336
and glutamate 376. in addition, there are two solvent molecules 2.0 å from the
iron, resulting in square pyramidal geometry with histidine 331 as the axial ligand. the iron site in  xxxg1660xxx  is essentially identical, except
that three water molecules are within 2.3 å of the iron (32). the difference in the
number of water molecules may be caused by the higher resolution of the  xxxg1660xxx  structure, 2.0 å compared with 2.3 å for  xxxg2276xxx . the additional water molecule results in a six-coordinate iron atom with
octahedral geometry; the axial ligands are histidine 285 and a water molecule. in
both enzymes, these histidine residues had previously been identified as iron ligands by site-directed mutagenesis (29, 38). mutation to alanine of glutamate 286
of rat  xxxg1660xxx  increases the km value for bh4 about 100-fold,
suggesting that this residue has a role in pterin binding (19). in the structure of
human  xxxg1660xxx , this residue is hydrogen bonded to one of the
water ligands to the iron (32).

mechanism
in light of the homologies of the catalytic domains of these enzymes, it is not
surprising that their mechanisms appear to be similar. indeed, in the following
discussion the assumption is made that the mechanisms are identical. this allows
results obtained with either phenylalanine or  xxxg2276xxx  to be used to
build up a self-consistent mechanistic picture.

metal requirement
both phenylalanine and  xxxg2276xxx  were found to contain slightly less
than one iron atom per monomer when first purified (39, 40). a direct relationship between the iron content and the activity was subsequently established for
both enzymes (41, 42). the iron is in the ferric form when the enzymes are purified (39, 43). reduction of the iron to the ferrous form is required for  xxxg1660xxx  to be active (44, 45), although metal reconstitution studies have
shown that  xxxg2276xxx  requires  xxxd2385xxx  for activity (42). tetrahydropterins can reduce the iron atom in either enzyme, suggesting that bh4 is the
physiological reductant (44-46). the  xxxd2385xxx  is readily oxidized by molecular oxygen (46, 47). tryptophan hydroxylase has recently been shown to require
 xxxd2385xxx  for activity (7). no metal has been found which can replace the iron
in forming active enzyme with any of the three hydroxylases, although several
other metals will bind in place of the iron (48, 49).
in contrast to the eukaryotic enzymes,  xxxg1660xxx  from c.
violaceum contains a stoichiometric amount of copper when purified (2). catalysis requires reduction of the copper, with dithiothreitol being the most effective
reductant (50). the presence of a metal other than iron in a protein that was
homologous to the eukaryotic enzymes raised obvious questions about the mechanistic role of the metal in these enzymes. the situation was further complicated
with the report that reduction of the copper by thiols led to its dissociation, and
the copper-free enzyme was fully active (51). this result led to the proposal that
this  xxxg1660xxx  does not require any metal for activity (51, 52).
however, chen & frey (13) have recently reported that the c. violaceum enzyme
is unable to hydroxylate phenylalanine in the absence of iron and requires a stoichiometric amount of iron for full activity.

steady state kinetics
complete steady state kinetic mechanisms have been described for c. violaceum
 xxxg1660xxx  (53) and for rat  xxxg2276xxx  (54). both studies are consistent with a tri-bi sequential mechanism in which no chemistry
occurs until all substrates are bound. in the case of  xxxg1660xxx ,
the data are consistent with binding of oxygen as the first substrate, followed by
binding of phenylalanine and 6,7-dimethyltetrahydropterin in random order;
some preference for binding of the pterin before the amino acid was noted (53).

less complete analyses have been carried out with eukaryotic phenylalanine
hydroxylase; in the rat enzyme the tetrahydropterin appears to bind before phenylalanine (47). the data with  xxxg2276xxx  were interpreted in favor of a
fully ordered mechanism, with 6-methyltetrahydropterin (6-meph 4), oxygen,
and tyrosine binding in that order; oxygen binds in rapid equilibrium, so that no
km value is observed for this substrate (54).

substrate specificity
pterin specificity a variety of substitutions at the 6 position of the tetrahydropterin ring (i), where the natural substrate has a dihydroxypropyl side chain,
are tolerated in substrates for at least one of the pterin-dependent hydroxylases.
the most commonly used substrate has been 6-meph 4, a good substrate for all
three enzymes (55-57). phenyl, ethyl, hydroxymethyl, and trihydroxypropyl side
chains are also tolerated at the 6 position (56, 58), but not a carboxylate (59),
consistent with the hydrophobic nature of the active sites. substitution of a
methyl group at the 7 position is tolerated, but this results in some of the tetrahydropterin being consumed unproductively by both phenylalanine and tyrosine
hydroxylase (55, 56). disubstitution at the 6 position is also tolerated by tyrosine
hydroxylase (60). tetrahydropterins substituted at the 5 or 8 position are not substrates for  xxxg2276xxx  (56, 60). 2,4-diamino-6,7-dimethyl-tetrahydropterin is reported to be a substrate for  xxxg1660xxx  (59), but
replacement of the oxygen at c2 results in loss of activity with both phenylalanine and  xxxg2276xxx  (59, 60).

the complete pyrazine ring of the pterin is not required for activity, because
2,5,6-triamino-4-pyrimidinone (ii) and 5-benzylamino-2,6-diamino-4-pyrimidinone will support hydroxylation by  xxxg1660xxx  (61, 62). the
pyrimidodiazepine iii is also a slow substrate for  xxxg1660xxx 
(63), further establishing that the pyrimidine ring is critical.
amino acid specificity there are two aspects to the amino acid specificity
of the pterin-dependent hydroxylases: the relative specificities for the three
aromatic amino acids as substrates and the range of amino acids that can be
hydroxylated. the relative affinities of tyrosine and  xxxg1660xxx

for different amino acid substrates are affected by the presence of the regulatory
domains (64). in addition, discussions of the substrate specificity of phenylalanine
hydroxylase are complicated by the need for activation by an amino acid substrate
when bh4 is used for the nonactivated wild-type enzyme (65). with respect to the
intact enzymes, each of the three hydroxylases will utilize all three aromatic amino
acids as substrates to some extent.  xxxg1660xxx  will hydroxylate
tryptophan (55), with a km value 100-fold and a vmax value 2.6% those for phenylalanine (65). with tyrosine as the substrate, a tetrahydropterin oxidase activity
results, in that no  xxxd2471xxx  can be detected (66); the vmax and
v/ktyr values for this reaction are only 5% the values found with phenylalanine as
substrate (64). an inability to hydroxylate tyrosine is consistent with the physiological role of this enzyme of producing tyrosine. in contrast,  xxxg2276xxx  will use phenylalanine as a substrate (67, 68), forming both tyrosine and small
amounts of 3-hydroxyphenylalanine (69). the vmax value for this reaction is
within a factor of four of that seen with tyrosine, whereas the km value for phenylalanine is sixfold that for tyrosine (64). this has led to the suggestion that  xxxg2276xxx  could catalyze the formation of  xxxd2471xxx  from
phenylalanine in cells (70). tryptophan is a poor substrate for  xxxg2276xxx , with a km value some 20-fold that of tyrosine and a significantly lower vmax
value (71). tryptophan hydroxylase can hydroxylate phenylalanine (57); the
kinetic parameters obtained with the recombinant catalytic core are very similar
to those for tryptophan (7). tyrosine is a poor substrate for this enzyme, with most
of the tetrahydropterin being consumed unproductively (7, 57).
in light of the homology of the catalytic domains, the regulatory domains have
been proposed to be responsible for the substrate specificity of these enzymes
(72). indeed, the isolated catalytic domains of rat phenylalanine and tyrosine
hydroxylase show reduced specificities for phenylalanine versus tyrosine, consistent with such a role for the regulatory domains (64). however, the isolated catalytic domain of  xxxg1660xxx  is still unable to form tyrosine.
chimeric proteins containing the regulatory domain of one of these enzymes and
the catalytic domain of the other have substrate specificities similar to that of the
intact protein that supplied the catalytic domain. thus, the absolute substrate
specificity is determined by the catalytic domain. the effect of the regulatory
domain on specificity is on the general shape and flexibility of the active site (64).
both phenylalanine and  xxxg2276xxx  will accept as substrates a range
of p-substituted phenylalanines. for bovine  xxxg2276xxx  there is a

size of the p-substituent (73), suggesting a constricted binding site. table 1 lists

catechol inhibition phenylalanine and  xxxg2276xxx  will each form
very tight complexes with catechols, with kd values in the nanomolar range (47,
79). in both cases, spectroscopic analyses indicate that both oxygens of the catechol are ligands to the iron in the ferric state (80, 81). catecholamines are also
reported to be inhibitors of tryptophan hydroxylase, but the interaction has not
been characterized (82). only for  xxxg2276xxx  is there evidence that this
inhibition is physiologically relevant. indeed, when  xxxg2276xxx  is isolated from nonrecombinant sources, the enzyme contains a mixture of catecholamines bound to the iron (83, 84).

rate-determining step
a minimal kinetic mechanism for a hydroxylase would involve substrate binding, formation of the hydroxylating intermediate, hydroxylation, and product dissociation. the most extensive kinetic studies have been carried out with rat
 xxxg2276xxx . with tyrosine as substrate, there is no burst of  xxxd2471xxx  formation after the first turnover, ruling out slow product release
as rate limiting (71). there is no significant isotope effect when [3,5-2h2]tyrosine is used as substrate, ruling out carbon-hydrogen bond cleavage during
hydroxylation as rate limiting (54). when the rate of tetrahydropterin oxidation
is monitored, the vmax value for a series of substituted phenylalanines is independent of the identity of the amino acid substrate, suggesting that no chemistry
involving the amino acid occurs in the rate-limiting step (71). these observations
are consistent with formation of the hydroxylating intermediate being rate limiting; the subsequent hydroxylation and product release steps would be much
faster. with  xxxg1660xxx  there is no significant kinetic-isotope
effect with ring-deuterated phenylalanine as substrate when bh4 is used (85).
however, with 6-meph4 a small kinetic isotope effect is seen, suggesting that
the rates of oxygen activation and hydroxylation are comparable in this case.

chemical mechanism
identity of the hydroxylating intermediate as shown in figure 1, one of the
products of the reactions catalyzed by all three hydroxylases is a 4a-hydroxypterin. the oxygen atoms in both the amino acid and the pterin products have
been shown to come from molecular oxygen (8, 86). the formation of this compound establishes that there must be a reaction between molecular oxygen and
tetrahydropterin during catalysis. model studies of the reaction of oxygen with
reduced tetrahydropterins (87) and the well-established formation of 4-peroxyflavins by flavin monooxygenases (88) suggest that a 4a-peroxytetrahydropterin
is the immediate result of the reaction of the tetrahydropterin and molecular oxygen. based on model studies with both flavins and pterins, this reaction is
expected to occur in two steps: an initial slow, single-electron transfer to form
superoxide and the pterin cation radical followed by rapid combination of the
two radicals (figure 6) (87, 89). the 18o kinetic-isotope effect of 1.016 seen
with  xxxg2276xxx  is consistent with such a reaction (90).

the 4a-peroxypterin must be considered as a candidate for the hydroxylating
intermediate, since the analogous 4a-peroxyflavin is thought to be the hydroxylating intermediate in the flavin phenol hydroxylases (88). however, the range of
reactions listed in table 1 resembles the reactions catalyzed by cytochrome
p-450–dependent hydroxylases, in which the hydroxylating intermediate is a
high-valence iron-oxo species (91), rather than those catalyzed by the flavin phenol hydroxylases (88). for example, p-hydroxybenzoate hydroxylase cannot
hydroxylate the nonactivated aromatic ring in benzoate (92), a reaction analogous to that catalyzed by  xxxg1660xxx , and has not been reported
to carry out epoxidation or aliphatic hydroxylation reactions. thus, it seems
likely that a more reactive species containing the iron, either a pterin-oxygeniron species or an iron-oxygen species (8), is involved.
the products from uncoupled turnover by  xxxg1660xxx  have
been used as a probe for the mechanistic fate of such a peroxypterin. with a variety of nonphysiological substrates, all three enzymes oxidize significantly more
than 1 mol of tetrahydropterin per mol of amino acid hydroxylated. if a peroxypterin is the hydroxylating intermediate, such uncoupled turnover could result in
production of  xxxd2298xxx  and quinonoid dihydropterin as products upon
the breakdown of the peroxypterin. dix and benkovic (93) reported that about
threefold as much tetrahydropterin is consumed as hydroxylated amino acid is
produced when 4-cl-phenylalanine is a substrate for  xxxg1660xxx .
the amount of hydroxylated amino acid formed agreed well with the amount of
4-hydroxypterin produced, suggesting that the oxygen-oxygen bond is not
cleaved unless hydroxylation occurs. no  xxxd2298xxx  was detected; these
authors proposed that oxygen is reduced to water in unproductive turnover. contradictory results were reported by davis & kaufman (66, 94) with tyrosine as
the substrate for this enzyme. tyrosine is not hydroxylated by phenylalanine
hydroxylase, but rather converts the enzyme to a slow tetrahydropterin oxidase.
both the hydroxypterin and  xxxd2298xxx  were detected as products in this
reaction. such a result requires cleavage of the oxygen-oxygen bond of a peroxytetrahydropterin intermediate even in the absence of oxygen atom transfer to an
amino acid substrate. these authors suggested that the peroxypterin is an intermediate in the formation of the true hydroxylating intermediate, a high-valence
iron-oxo compound. the branched pathway shown in figure 7 was proposed to
account for the results (94).

figure 7 mechanism of davis & kaufman (94) for turnover of phenylalanine hydrozylase in the presence of tyrosine.

an alternative possibility involving activation of the peroxypterin via a
pyrazine ring-opened species was proposed by hamilton for both pterin and
flavin-dependent monooxygenases (95). the loss of substituted amines from the
4 position of triaminopyrimidines with phenylalanine hydroxylases was initially
interpreted in favor of such a mechanism (96, 97). however, such an intermediate seems unlikely in light of the inability of this enzyme to catalyze the ring closure reaction required to regenerate the intact pterin (4). instead, the loss of the
benzylamino group would be caused by cleavage of the cn bond in the carbinolamine product being more favorable than cleavage of the co bond, as a result of
the relative leaving group propensities of the two substituents.
although the range of reactions carried out by these enzymes and the reported
production of the hydroxypterin in uncoupled turnover with phenylalanine
hydroxylase are consistent with the hydroxylating intermediate being an ironoxo species, it should be emphasized that there is no direct evidence for such a
role for the iron in these enzymes. iron is clearly required for activity, and mutation of the ligands to the iron results in loss of detectable activity (29, 38). however, the electron paramagnetic resonance (epr) spectrum of enzyme frozen  xxxd2274xxx 
k during turnover does not show any epr-detectable species; this can be rationalized by formation of the hydroxylating intermediate being much slower than
its subsequent reaction (46). an additional potential role for the iron atom would
be to assist in the reaction of tetrahydropterin and molecular oxygen to form the
peroxypterin. the 18o kinetic-isotope effects determined by francisco et al (90)
are consistent with either a single-electron transfer from tetrahydropterin to oxygen, as shown in figure 6 or with equilibrium binding of o2 to the iron atom followed by single-electron transfer from the tetrahydropterin to the iron-bound
oxygen. chen & frey (13) have reported that metal-free  xxxg1660xxx  from c. violaceum will catalyze tetrahydropterin oxidation but not phenylalanine hydroxylation. this suggests that the iron is required for formation of
the hydroxylating intermediate but is not involved in the initial reaction of oxygen and the tetrahydropterin. if this is the case, the peroxypterin must react with

the iron en route to formation of any iron-oxo hydroxylating species. a reasonable intermediate for this reaction suggested by dix et al (8) is the peroxypteriniron complex iv. heterolytic cleavage of the oxygen-oxygen bond in such a
species would generate the peroxypterin and the iron-oxo hydroxylating species
directly (98). complex iv must also be considered a viable candidate for the
hydroxylating intermediate.

the ability of cytochrome p-450–dependent hydroxylases to utilize peroxides
and other oxidants in place of reducing equivalents and oxygen, the “peroxide
shunt,” has provided a more direct probe of the role of the iron in those systems
(91). in pterin-dependent enzymes, it has been reported that  xxxg2276xxx 
can hydroxylate tyrosine to  xxxd2471xxx  by using  xxxd2298xxx 
in the absence of any tetrahydropterin (5), suggesting that the pterin is not part of
the hydroxylating intermediate. however, ribeiro et al (68) reported that they
were unable to reproduce this result.
mechanism of hydroxylation it was noted early on that the tyrosine produced
from [p-3h] phenylalanine by phenylalanine or  xxxg2276xxx  and the [5ho]-tryptophan produced from [5-3h]-tryptophan by tryptophan hydroxylase
still contained most of the radioactivity (86, 99, 100). in each case the label was
attached to the carbon adjacent to the site of hydroxylation. as is clear from the
products obtained with substituted phenylalanines as substrates for both phenylalanine and  xxxg2276xxx , substituents other than hydrogen isotopes can
also undergo such an nih shift. these include cl, br, and methyl substituents, but
not f or methoxy. the observation of an nih shift in a variety of hydroxylation
reactions led guroff et al (101) to propose the cationic cyclohexadienyl intermediate v for  xxxg1660xxx . such an intermediate could then rearomatize, losing a proton or tritium. a significant kinetic isotope effect on the proton
loss step would result in preferential retention of tritium. the observation that
arene oxides are products of a number of aromatic hydroxylation reactions led to
the proposal that the arene oxide vi was formed as a precursor to v (102). the
formation of an epoxide from [2,5-h2]phenylalanine by  xxxg1660xxx  is consistent with the involvement of an arene oxide (77), although it rigorously only establishes the ability of the enzyme to carry out epoxidation reactions.
as a more direct probe for the involvement of an arene oxide, the isotope effects

on product distribution upon hydroxylation of [4-2h]phenylalanine and [3,52h ]phenylalanine by  xxxg2276xxx  were determined (69). in both cases
2
there was a decrease in the hydroxylation at the site of the isotope, but no
detectable increase in hydroxylation at the nondeuterated position. these results
rule out the partitioning of a common intermediate such as an arene oxide in the
formation of these two products.

more recently, the product distribution from a series of p-substituted phenylalanines as substrates for  xxxg2276xxx  was used as a mechanistic probe
(78). there was a good correlation of the site of oxygen addition with the size of
the substituent at the 4 position of the aromatic ring, with a transition from primarily p-hydroxylation with phenylalanine to exclusively m-hydroxylation with
4-ch3o-phenylalanine. thus, with this enzyme at least, the site of hydroxylation
of these nonphysiological substrates is determined primarily by steric factors.
increasing amounts of tetrahydropterin were oxidized without concomitant
hydroxylation of the amino acid as the electron-donating ability of the substituent
decreased, giving a r-value of about -5 with both 6-meph4 and bh4. this result
is consistent with a cationic intermediate. moreover, the amount of nih shift
seen varied with the identity of the substituent in a manner consistent with a
cationic species. the cationic cyclohexadiene vii was proposed as the product of
the initial oxygen addition; the similarity of this compound to v is obvious. vii
would then rearrange directly to the phenolic product.

regulatory properties
the catalytic domains of the pterin-dependent hydroxylases are sufficiently similar to assume that all three enzymes have essentially the same catalytic mechanism. in contrast, the regulatory domains of the eukaryotic enzymes are not
homologous. thus, it is not surprising that the regulatory properties are distinct.
as a result, the regulatory properties of each enzyme will be discussed separately.

 xxxg1660xxx 
virtually all of the characterization to date has been done with the enzyme from
rat liver. a variety of treatments, some of which are clearly not physiological,
will increase the activity of  xxxg1660xxx  from eukaryotic sources.
when the concentration of phenylalanine is varied, sigmoidal kinetics are
observed if bh4 is used as substrate (18); the effect is less pronounced if other
tetrahydropterins are used (103, 104). treatment of the enzyme with chymotrypsin or lysolecithin increases the measured vmax value and gives sigmoidal
kinetics. activation by proteolysis correlates with the loss of about 100 residues
from the amino terminus (22); this would correspond to removal of the regulatory domain. consistent with this, the isolated catalytic domain does not require
pretreatment for full activity (64, 105). treatment with thiol-modifying reagents
such as  xxxd2684xxx  has a similar activating effect (103). indeed, treatment with lysolecithin exposes a thiol residue (18), suggesting that the two treatments result in similar conformational changes. the reactive thiol has been
identified as cysteine 236 (106). with other tetrahydropterins such as 6-meph4
and 6,7-dimethyltetrahydropterin, the enzyme activity is reported to be high without such pretreatment (103, 104).
the effects of phenylalanine and bh4 on the activity are more likely to be
physiologically relevant than these chemical modifications. if assays are started
by adding enzyme, there is a lag in the rate of tyrosine formation (107). pretreatment of the enzyme with phenylalanine abolishes the lag, whereas pretreatment
with bh4 or 6-meph4 increases it (107). treatment with lysolecithin also abolishes the lag. based on an extensive analysis of the effects of phenylalanine and
pterins on the kinetics, shiman and coworkers have proposed a model (figure 8)
for the effects of amino acids and pterins on the activity of  xxxg1660xxx  (47, 108, 109). the enzyme as isolated is proposed to be in an inactive
form, ei. binding of phenylalanine converts it to an active form, ea; this would
involve formation of an active site for phenylalanine (108). tetrahydropterins
bind to ei, trapping the enzyme in the inactive form. bh4 binds ei more tightly
than 6-meph4 (109). kinetic modeling based on such a model successfully predicts the low activity of  xxxg1660xxx  in tissues, owing to the predominance of the bh4-ei complex (110). this regulatory mechanism results in a
large increase in  xxxg1660xxx  activity in response to an increase in
plasma phenylalanine levels (109).
data from parniak & kaufman (103) are suggestive of two separate phenylalanine-binding sites, a regulatory site and a separate active site. the unmodified
enzyme is reported to bind 1.5 equivalents of phenylalanine per monomer with
strong positive cooperativity, whereas the thiol-modified enzyme binds only one
equivalent with no cooperativity. in agreement with a two-site model, the activating phenylalanine remains bound during multiple turnovers without being hydroxylated (111). activation by phenylalanine has been attributed to displacement of an
inhibitory peptide, presumably in the regulatory domain; proteolysis would remove

the peptide completely, whereas chemical modification would disrupt its interaction with the catalytic domain (103). several observations are suggestive of a conformational change upon conversion from ei to ea. activation by phenylalanine or
lysolecithin converts the enzyme to a form that will bind phenylalanine (107, 112);
this is used as a purification step for  xxxg1660xxx  (112). the activated enzyme is slightly more sensitive to proteases, whereas binding of bh4
decreases the protease sensitivity (104). phenylalanine binding alters the fluorescence properties (111, 113) and increases the total volume about 10% (25). bh4
has an opposite effect on the fluorescence properties (113). these data are consistent with ea having a more open conformation than ei. although activation is proposed to result in formation of a competent active site for binding phenylalanine
(108), the iron environments in the two enzyme forms are indistinguishable (25).
amino acids other than phenylalanine will activate the enzyme, although frequently not as well (65, 107). the ea form of the enzyme is also reported to have
a broader substrate specificity (65), although the need to separate the specificities
for activation and catalysis clearly complicates such analyses.
in addition to the regulation by substrates,  xxxg1660xxx  is regulated by phosphorylation of serine 16 (114). interpretation of the effects of phosphorylation is complicated by the presence of 0.2-0.3 phosphates per monomer
in the enzyme as isolated (111, 115), although some recent studies have been carried out with recombinant enzyme which avoid this problem (116, 117). treatment with camp-dependent  xxxg1836xxx  (pka) increases the amount of
phosphate per monomer to one (115). a calmodulin-dependent protein kinase
(cam-pk) will phosphorylate the same site as pka (118). the phosphorylated
enzyme is reported to be two- to fourfold as active as the unphosphorylated
enzyme (115, 116), but the activation is reported to depend on whether bh4 is
used (115). the s16d and s16e mutants have similar activities to the phosphorylated enzyme, consistent with the effect being caused by the introduction of the
negative charge (116). both the phosphorylated enzyme and the mutants are activated further by lysolecithin (115, 116). the phosphorylated enzyme still shows
sigmoidal kinetics with varied phenylalanine (115); the increased activity is primarily owing to an increased vmax value (116).
a critical observation in interpreting the effects of phosphorylation on  xxxg1660xxx  is that activation of the phosphorylated enzyme by phenylalanine is more rapid and occurs at lower concentrations than with the
unphosphorylated enzyme (119). a similar observation has been made with the
recombinant human enzyme (117). thus, phosphorylation appears to modulate the

balance between the ea and ei forms of  xxxg1660xxx . moreover,
bh4 inhibits the phosphorylation (117, 120, 121), suggesting that the bh4-ei complex is phosphorylated more slowly or not at all. in light of the complexity of the
regulatory properties of the unphosphorylated enzyme, it seems likely that the magnitude of the effects of phosphorylation on activity described to date does
not directly reflect the magnitude of the change in a specific rate or equilibrium
constant. clearly defining the effects of phosphorylation will likely require an
extensive analysis comparable to that carried out on the unphosphorylated enzyme.

 xxxg2276xxx 
the principal means of post-translational regulation of  xxxg2276xxx 
appears to be reversible phosphorylation of serine residues in the regulatory
domain (122). despite more than two decades of study by a number of different
laboratories, the details of the effects of phosphorylation and the physiological
relevance of the different phosphorylation sites are still not fully established.
this is caused in part by the difficulty of obtaining purified nonrecombinant protein, the complexity of the problem, and the lack of realization in earlier studies
that the enzyme isolated from eukaryotic sources contains bound catecholamines.
because of space limitations, an extensive discussion of the literature cannot be
given here. many of the earlier studies are described in a review by zigmond et
al (122), and a more extensive discussion of agents that modulate phosphorylation of  xxxg2276xxx  in cells is given by haycock (123).
there are four serine residues in rat  xxxg2276xxx , which are phosphorylated both in vivo and in vitro, at positions 8, 19, 31, and 40 in the rat enzyme
(124, 125). human  xxxg2276xxx  has a threonine residue at position 8 (14).
there is general consensus that pka is specific for phosphorylation of serine 40
(125, 127). purified pka will phosphorylate serine 40 specifically (125), and
agents that increase camp levels in cells increase the level of phosphorylation of
this residue (123, 124, 128). serine 19 can be phosphorylated in the pure enzymes
by cam-pkii (125, 127, 129) and by mitogen-activated protein (map) kinaseactivated protein kinases (130). cam-pkii also phosphorylates serine 40 (125,
127, 129) and has been reported to phosphorylate serine 31 in the human isoform
2. map kinase-activated protein kinase 1 phosphorylates both serine 19 and 40 in
the human hydroxylase, but  xxxg1373xxx  phosphorylates only serine 40 (130). in cells, calcium or agents that increase the levels of
intracellular calcium also increase the level of phosphorylation of serine 19 (124,
131–133), although additional residues have been reported to be phosphorylated
under these conditions (123, 131, 133, 134). in the pure enzyme, serine 31 can be
phosphorylated by the map kinases  xxxg1369xxx  and  xxxg1366xxx  (130, 135, 136). in cells,
phorbol esters and  xxxg1564xxx  increase the activities of  xxxg1369xxx  and  xxxg1366xxx 
and the level of phosphorylation of serine 31 (123, 124, 131, 132, 135). no kinase
has been identified that phosphorylates serine 8. in cells only phosphatase
inhibitors have been found to alter the level of phosphorylation of this residue

(124). thus the most likely candidates for the physiological kinases are campkii for serine 19, erk for serine 31, and pka for serine 40 (123).
evaluation of the effects of phosphorylation on the properties of tyrosine
hydroxylase is clearly complicated by the number of phosphorylation sites. it has
been further complicated by the fact that enzyme isolated from tissues contains
substoichiometric amounts of covalent phosphate (43, 137); the studies cited
above suggest that the phosphate is distributed among the different serine
residues. the discussion here will be limited to studies carried out with purified
proteins. the earliest studies were done with wild-type enzymes isolated from
tissues. these showed that rat  xxxg2276xxx  could be phosphorylated by
pka (138), with the incorporation of up to 0.7 mol of phosphate per monomer
(139). when the enzyme was assayed at ph 6, the effect of phosphorylation was
to decrease the value of the km for 6-meph4 without affecting the vmax value or
the km value for tyrosine (138, 139). it was subsequently reported with the
bovine brain enzyme that phosphorylation increases the ph optimum from 6 to
about 6.6, so that the effects of phosphorylation by pka depend on the ph of the
assays (140). at ph 6, phosphorylation led to a decrease in the km for bh4 of
about threefold and an increase in the ki value for dopamine of about twofold; at
ph 7, the km value for bh4 was down twofold, the vmax value was up threefold,
and the ki value for dopamine was up eightfold.
the observation that  xxxg2276xxx  purified from bovine or rat cells
contained tightly bound catecholamines is clearly relevant to these early studies.
andersson et al (141) reported that the epr spectrum of the enzyme was insensitive to the presence of substrate unless it was phosphorylated by pka (43, 141).
upon phosphorylation the iron in the purified enzyme could be reduced by a
tetrahydropterin (141). the same group subsequently reported that phosphorylation increased the rate of dissociation of bound norepinephrine by about sixfold;
a pka value of 5.3 was measured for the dissociation of the unphosphorylated
enzyme (142). these data thus suggested that a major effect of phosphorylation
was to release a bound inhibitor rather than to simply increase the rate of catalytic steps. by using recombinant rat enzyme, daubner et al (143) were able to
separate the effects of phosphorylation of serine 40 on catecholamine binding
and catalysis. the recombinant enzyme lacked both covalent phosphate and
bound catecholamine; it also had a much higher specific activity than nonrecombinant enzyme. at ph 7, phosphorylation of serine 40 with pka had only a modest effect, decreasing the km value for bh4 about twofold, consistent with
previous studies of the nonrecombinant enzyme. binding of dopamine to the
recombinant enzyme decreased its activity by a factor of 20; the specific activity
of this dopamine-complexed enzyme was the same as nonrecombinant rat
enzyme, consistent with the presence of catecholamines in the latter. subsequent
phosphorylation of the dopamine-bound recombinant enzyme resulted in a large
increase in activity at ph 7 owing to a decrease of twofold in the km for bh4 and
an increase of tenfold in the vmax value. an identical effect was seen upon phosphorylation of the nonrecombinant enzyme. thus, the effects of phosphorylation

of serine 40 on  xxxg2276xxx  can be attributed to a modest decrease in
the km value for the tetrahydropterin and a release from the inhibition by bound
catecholamines. ramsey & fitzpatrick (79) subsequently measured the effects of
phosphorylation of serine 40 on the binding of dopamine and  xxxd2471xxx  to both the inactive ferric and to the active ferrous forms of tyrosine
hydroxylase. no significant effect was found on the binding of either catecholamine to the ferrous form of the enzyme. in contrast, there was a large effect
on binding to the ferric enzyme. the affinity for  xxxd2471xxx 
decreased some 18-fold and that for dopamine over 300-fold upon phosphorylation; the effects were due to comparable increases in the dissociation rates.
thus, with regard to serine 40, the effects of phosphorylation on activity can
be explained by the mechanism shown in figure 9. the unphosphorylated enzyme
with  xxxd2385xxx  is fully active. oxidation of the iron to the ferric form results in
inactive enzyme, but this can be reduced by bh4. accumulation of the product
 xxxd2471xxx  or dopamine results in formation of the inactive enzymecatecholamine complex. phosphorylation leads to dissociation of the inhibitory
catecholamine, allowing the iron to be reduced and catalysis to commence.
the effects of phosphorylation at the other serine residues are much less understood. vulliet and coworkers (144) showed that the rat enzyme could be phosphorylated by cam-pk and that the phosphorylation occurred at a separate site
from that labeled by pka. no change in enzyme activity was detected on incorporation of 0.3 mol of phosphate per monomer catalyzed by cam-pk. when the
stoichiometry of labeling was 1.3/monomer, both serines 19 and 40 were labeled
(125, 145). treatment of the rat enzyme with cam-pkii has been reported to have
no effect on the activity unless a separate activator protein is included; in its presence the activity increases about twofold at ph 6 or 6.5 (146, 147). the activator
protein has been identified as a neuronal protein of the 14-3-3 family (148, 149);
this is a highly conserved family of brain proteins involved in a number of signal
transduction pathways (150). atkinson et al (147) also reported that no increase in
the activity of the rat enzyme occurs upon phosphorylation by cam-pkii unless a
separate activator protein is included, in which case there is a 2.5-fold increase. in
this case, when the stoichiometry of phosphate incorporation was 0.8/monomer,
the majority of the label (~65%) was at a single site, but two other tryptic peptides
were labeled. treatment of  xxxg2276xxx  from bovine chromaffin cells
with a map kinase isolated from the same cells resulted in phosphorylation of
serines 31 and 40, with a twofold activation (136).

there have been a series of studies with the different isoforms of human  xxxg2276xxx . because they were done with recombinant enzymes, there is no
endogenous phosphate or bound catecholamine to complicate interpretation of the
results. as noted above, there are four isoforms of the human enzyme owing to
differential splicing, differing in the size of an insert before serine 31 of hth1.
pka phosphorylates isoforms hth1, hth2, and hth3 on the same residue, equivalent to serine 40 of hth1 and the rat enzyme. with hth1 and hth2, this results
in a twofold decrease in the measured value of the km for bh4, no change in the
vmax value, and a threefold increase in the kd for dopamine (127). these effects
on km and vmax values are comparable to the results reported for the recombinant
rat enzyme. in contrast, phosphorylation of hth3 by pka resulted in an increase
of 2.5-fold in the values of both the km for bh4 and the ki for dopamine (129).
cam-pkii phosphorylated both serine 19 and the residue corresponding to serine
40 in isoforms hth1, hth2, and hth3 (127, 129). in addition, the serine
corresponding to serine 31 was phosphorylated by cam-pkii in hth2 (127).
phosphorylation by cam-pkii was reported to have no significant effects on the
activity of hth1, hth2, or hth3, with the exception of a twofold increase in the
ki value for dopamine with hth2 (127). however, in a subsequent report an
increase in activity upon phosphorylation of hth1 by cam-pkii was described;
the increase showed a correlation with the extent of phosphorylation of serine 40
by this kinase (130). no further activation was seen upon the addition of 14-3-3
protein. map kinase (erk) phosphorylates all four isoforms at different rates,
with hth3 and hth4 being good substrates for the kinase, whereas hth2 was
phosphorylated very slowly (130). in hth1, hth3, and hth4, phosphorylation
occurred at serine 31 or the analogous residue. in the cases of hth1 and hth3,
the activity doubled upon incorporation of a stoichiometric amount of phosphate.
finally, map kinase-activated kinase 1 phosphorylates all four isoforms on serine
40, whereas map kinase-activated kinase 2 phosphorylates all four isoforms on
both serine 19 and 40 (130). with both kinases, the activities of all the tyrosine
hydroxylase isoforms increased up to threefold; the amount of the increase correlated with the extent of phosphorylation of serine 40.

tryptophan hydroxylase
because of the lack of pure enzyme, the regulatory properties of tryptophan
hydroxylase have seen relatively little study. the activity of the enzyme is
affected by phosphorylation. the site of phosphorylation by pka has been identified as serine 58 by site-directed mutagenesis (20, 151). however, the effects of
phosphorylation on activity, which have been described to date, have been quite
modest. incubation of rat brain extracts with atp, mgcl2, and cacl2 was initially shown by yamauchi & fujisawa to increase the activity of tryptophan
hydroxylase about twofold (152). the requirement for ca2+ suggested a need for
a calcium-dependent kinase. this was confirmed when these authors reported
that incubation of a partially pure preparation of the rat brain enzyme with cam-

tetrahydropterin-dependent amino acid hydroxylases

pkii increased the activity about twofold (153). the preparation used also contained an activator protein; this activator protein was subsequently identified as a
14-3-3 protein (146, 148), also involved in activation of  xxxg2276xxx .
direct phosphorylation of tryptophan hydroxylase by cam-pkii was demonstrated by ehret et al (153a). in addition pka has been shown to phosphorylate
this enzyme, resulting in twofold activation if the activator protein is present
(154). the effects of pka and cam-pkii were the same and were not additive,
suggesting that the same site is phosphorylated by both. the activation was
caused by a 30% decrease in the km value for 6-meph4 and a 50% increase in
the vmax value. direct binding of a 14-3-3 protein to tryptophan hydroxylation
was demonstrated by furukawa et al (155). binding required prior phosphorylation by cam-pkii. the kd value for binding of the phosphorylated enzyme to
bovine 14-3-3 proteins was measured as 30 nm by banik et al (156). these data
are all consistent with a single phosphorylation site, serine 58, and with an additional requirement for a 14-3-3 protein for activation. however, there have been
reports of activation by phosphorylation alone (151, 156).

perspectives
phenylalanine, tyrosine, and tryptophan hydroxylase have attracted a great deal of
scientific interest over the years because they catalyze reactions critical for the
proper functioning of the central nervous system and because they constitute a
self-contained family of monooxygenases with novel properties. in recent years
the availability of the recombinant enzymes has allowed significant progress in
elucidating the mechanisms, structures, and regulation of these pterin-dependent
monooxygenases. the homologous catalytic core of each protein has been identified, and the structures of the catalytic domains of phenylalanine and tyrosine
hydroxylase have been determined. this will allow more detailed analyses of the
roles of individual amino acid residues in catalysis and stability. details of the catalytic events are beginning to emerge. however, the specific role of the iron atom
and the structure of the hydroxylating intermediate remain elusive. knowledge of
the regulatory properties, critical to understanding the biology of these systems,
has progressed unevenly. with  xxxg1660xxx , phenylalanine and
tetrahydrobiopterin levels interact in determining the enzyme activity; how this is
modulated by phosphorylation has not been determined in any quantitative fashion. for  xxxg2276xxx , detailed analyses of the effects of phosphorylation
have been carried out for only one of the several phosphorylation sites. understanding the regulatory properties of tryptophan hydroxylase has only just begun.
