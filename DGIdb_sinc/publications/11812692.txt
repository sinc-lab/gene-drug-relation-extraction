although the effects of local anesthetics on sodium
channels and various other channels and receptors
have been intensively investigated, there is little information available about their effects on n-methyl-daspartate (nmda) receptors. we examined the effects
of four local anesthetics (procaine, tetracaine,  xxxd383xxx , and lidocaine) on nmda-induced currents by
using a whole-cell patch-clamp technique in dissociated mouse hippocampal pyramidal neurons. procaine
and tetracaine produced a reversible and concentrationdependent inhibition of nmda-induced currents, but lidocaine showed little inhibition at 1 mm or less. the halfmaximal inhibition values (mm; mean ⫾ sem) for

t

he primary sites of action of local anesthetics are
voltage-gated sodium channels (1), but their effects on various other ion channels and receptors
(2– 6) have also been reported. studies have shown
that, although the majority of anesthetics have
␥- xxxd2177xxx  type a (gabaa)-receptor agonist
properties (7), a number of anesthetics have n-methyld-aspartate (nmda)-receptor, a subtype of glutamate
receptor, antagonist properties (8 –10). the nmda receptor is deeply involved in neuronal plasticity during
memory acquisition (11) and in pathological states,
such as nociception (12), hypoxic neuronal death (13),
and drug addiction (14). intrathecally administered
nmda antagonists reduce the minimum alveolar concentration of isoflurane (15) and prevent pain sensitization (12).
local anesthetics not only provide analgesia, but
also have neuroprotective effects against ischemic
neuronal damage (16), probably because of the blockade of na⫹ influx. of all local anesthetics, procaine
suppressed both the influx of extracellular ca2⫹ and
the release of ca2⫹ from the intracellular ca2⫹ stores

respectively. procaine 0.2 mm reduced the maximal
nmda-induced currents without affecting the 50% effective concentration values for nmda. the inhibition by
procaine exhibited voltage dependence and was more effective at negative potentials. these results indicate a noncompetitive antagonism of procaine on nmda receptors
and suggest that the inhibition is the result of a channelblocking mechanism.

in ischemic conditions (17). although the main mechanism for the prevention of ca2⫹ influx by local anesthetics is mediated by the blockade of na⫹ influx
through sodium channels, we hypothesized that procaine and other local anesthetics also directly inhibit
ca2⫹ influx through nmda receptors in neurons.
however, there is little available information about
the effects of local anesthetics on the nmda receptors.
only one article has shown that neither etidocaine nor
procaine inhibited nmda receptor gated channels (6).
the purpose of this study was to investigate the effects
of four local anesthetics (procaine, tetracaine,  xxxd383xxx , and lidocaine) on the nmda receptors in
mouse ca1 pyramidal neurons by using electrophysiological methods.

methods
this study was approved by the animal research
committee of kansai medical university. postnatal
(7–14 days) icr mice were anesthetized with diethyl
ether and decapitated. the brain was rapidly dissected, and the frontal section of the brain, including
the hippocampus, was cut into 500-␮m slices with a
microslicer (yis-102; astec, fukuoka, japan) in icecold krebs solution at 2°c– 4°c. the slices were preincubated in the krebs solution for 60 min at room

temperature (20°c–25°c). they were then enzymatically treated with 0.0125% pronase (calbiochemnovabiochem corporation, la jolla, ca) at 31°c for
7–20 min, followed by 0.0125% thermolysin at 31°c for
7–20 min. thereafter, they were incubated in the krebs
solution for another 60 min at room temperature. the
hippocampal ca1 region was then micropunched out
from the slices with a small needle and transferred to
a culture dish (falcon 3801; 35-mm diameter) filled
with oxygenated krebs solution. the pyramidal neurons in the ca1 region were mechanically dissociated
under a phase-contrast microscope by using a series of
fire-polished micropasteur pipettes with a variety of
orifice sizes (from 0.1- to 0.5-mm diameter). the isolated pyramidal neurons adhered to the bottom of the
dish within 30 min.
the ionic composition of the external solution
(krebs solution) was as follows (in mm): nacl 121.5,
kcl 4.7, cacl2 2.5, mgcl2 1.2, nahco3 15.5, kh2po4
1.2, and glucose 11.5, adjusted to ph 7.45 by bubbling
through 95% oxygen and 5% co2 gas. the internal
solution (pipette solution) contained (in mm) k-aspartate 103, kcl 20, nacl 10, mg-atp 5, creatine-phosphate
20, egta 5, cacl2 · 2h2o 1.03, and hepes 5, adjusted to
ph 7.0 with koh.
rapid application of drugs was achieved by using
the y-tube method (18). the y-tube was made from
polyethylene (2-mm diameter), and the outlet tip of
the y tube (0.1-mm diameter) was set approximately
0.5–1.0 mm away from the neuron recorded. this system enabled the complete exchange of external solution surrounding the recorded neuron within 10 –20
ms.
electrophysiological recordings were performed in
a conventional whole-cell configuration by using a
patch-clamp technique (19) at room temperature. the
electrode resistance, when filled with the internal solution, was 6 to 8 m⍀. the transmembrane currents
were measured with a patch-clamp amplifier (epc-7;
list electronics, darmstadt, germany). the current
and voltage were monitored on both a digital storage
oscilloscope (cs-8010; kenwood, tokyo, japan) and a
linearcorder (wr3320; graphtec, yokohama, japan)
and stored on a dat data recorder (rd-120te; teac,
tokyo, japan). except for obtaining current-voltage
relationship, the membrane potential was held at ⫺60
mv.
thermolysin, nmda, procaine, tetracaine,  xxxd383xxx , and lidocaine were obtained from sigma chemical (st. louis, mo). pronase and glycine were obtained from calbiochem and nacalai tesque (kyoto,
japan), respectively. pronase and thermolysin were
dissolved in krebs solution just before use. glycine,
nmda, procaine, tetracaine,  xxxd383xxx , and lidocaine were directly dissolved in mg2⫹-free external
solution (in mm: nacl 123.3, kcl 4.7, cacl2 2.5,
nahco3 15.5, kh2po4 1.2, and glucose 11.5, adjusted

to ph 7.45 by bubbling through 95% oxygen and 5%
co2 gas) just before use to avoid mg2⫹ block.
concentration-inhibition, concentration-response,
and current-voltage curves of the averaged data were
generated with origin 6.0 software (microcal software, northampton, ma). the data are represented as
mean ⫾ sem, and at least five neurons were used for
each data point. the results obtained were statistically
analyzed by the unpaired student’s t-test or one-way
analysis of variance (anova) followed by the scheffé
multiple comparison test. a p value ⬍0.05 was considered significant.

results
the effects of four local anesthetics (procaine, tetracaine,  xxxd383xxx , and lidocaine) on nmda-induced
currents were investigated. preapplication of local anesthetics in the absence of the agonists did not produce any current response.
coapplication of 0.3 mm nmda and 0.3 ␮m glycine to the neurons held at a holding potential of ⫺60
mv induced apparent inward currents that rapidly
reached the peak and then declined to the steady-state
level in the mg2⫹-free external solution. when one of
four local anesthetics (1 mm) was coapplied with
nmda and glycine during the steady-state phase of
the response, procaine, tetracaine, and  xxxd383xxx ,
but not lidocaine, reversibly inhibited the steady-state
current, as shown in figure 1. in three of five neurons,
lidocaine also showed a slight inhibition of steadystate nmda currents.
the effects of four local anesthetics on the steadystate nmda-induced currents are summarized in figure 2. the current amplitudes in the presence of local
anesthetics were normalized to the control steadystate current just before the application of local
anesthetics.
data were fitted with the following equation:

where i is the steady-state nmda-induced current in

steady-state nmda-induced current (control; in the
absence of local anesthetics), c is the concentration of
local anesthetics, n is the hill coefficient, and ic50 is
the half-maximal inhibition.
procaine and tetracaine (10 ␮m to 1 mm) inhibited
the nmda-induced currents in a concentrationdependent manner.  xxxd383xxx  at 1 mm significantly
inhibited the nmda-induced current (anova, p ⬍
0.05 versus the currents in the absence of  xxxd383xxx ). lidocaine, however, failed to exert significant
inhibition of the nmda-induced currents of 1 mm or
less. the obtained ic50 values (mm) from the fitting

to analyze the mechanism of procaine-induced

discussion
in this investigation, we showed that some local anesthetics, such as procaine and tetracaine, inhibited
nmda-induced currents in a concentration-dependent
manner, but lidocaine showed little inhibition at 1 mm
or less. the ic50 values (mm) for procaine, tetracaine,
 xxxd383xxx , and lidocaine at ⫺60 mv were 0.296 ⫾
0.031, 0.637 ⫾ 0.044, 2.781 ⫾ 0.940 (extrapolated data),
and 7.766 ⫾ 14.093 (extrapolated data), respectively. the
mode of inhibition by procaine seems to be noncompetitive and channel-blocking.
several potential limitations of our model should be
considered. first, in the study of concentrationinhibition relationships, reliable data could not be obtained for more than 1 mm  xxxd383xxx  and lidocaine
because of the failure of complete gigaohm sealing.
the acutely dissociated neurons seemed to be weak
compared with xenopus oocytes or mammalian cell
lines, e.g., hek293 cells expressing recombinant
nmda receptors, probably because they were enzymatically treated. this may be why the neurons became leaky with more than 1 mm local anesthetics.
thus, the concentration-inhibition curves of  xxxd383xxx  and lidocaine for more than 1 mm had to be
extrapolated, and the ic50 values for  xxxd383xxx  and
lidocaine were not reliable. yet  xxxd383xxx  significantly inhibited the nmda-induced currents at 1 mm
compared with those without  xxxd383xxx . however,

anesth analg
2002;94:325–30

lidocaine did not show significant inhibition even at 1
mm. second, only procaine was used to characterize
the inhibitory effect of local anesthetics on the nmda
receptor channels because the inhibition by  xxxd383xxx  and lidocaine at concentrations ⬍1 mm was not
sufficient for the characterization, and the inhibition
by tetracaine seemed similar to that of procaine. third,
we used acutely dissociated hippocampal neurons
from postnatal (7–14 days) mice to investigate native
nmda receptors because several discrepancies (21)
have been reported when comparing the pharmacological and biophysical properties of native nmda
receptors with those of recombinant ones. in addition,
the nmda receptor subunits expressed in a postnatal
mouse hippocampus are ⑀1/␨1 and ⑀2/␨1, which are
the same as those expressed in an adult mouse hippocampus (22). fourth, we did not study the effects of
local anesthetics on the nmda-induced peak currents
because apparent peak currents were not always obtained in the acutely isolated neurons (23), and steadystate currents have also been used for the characterization of the effects of drugs (9). furthermore,
nakagawa et al. (including one of the authors) (24)
demonstrated that the initial peak currents and
steady-state currents had nearly the same sensitivity
as noncompetitive antagonists. fifth, we chose only
four representative local anesthetics: procaine and tetracaine, which are aminoester local anesthetics; and
 xxxd383xxx  and lidocaine, which are aminoamido local anesthetics. procaine is mainly used for infiltration
and spinal anesthesia; tetracaine, for spinal anesthesia;
 xxxd383xxx , for peripheral nerve blockade and epidural and spinal anesthesia; and lidocaine, for infiltration, topical, epidural, and spinal anesthesia, and peripheral nerve blockade.
some local anesthetics suppressed the nmda receptor channel activity in a concentration-dependent
manner. århem and frankenhaeuser (25) reported
that the ic50 value for procaine on sodium permeability in a single myelinated fiber was 0.21 mm, which is
very similar to the ic50 value for procaine in the
nmda-induced currents obtained in this study. a
previous clinical study showed that the concentrations
of procaine at 15 and 105 minutes after intrathecal
injection of 150 mg procaine were approximately 18.3
and 1.1 mm, respectively (26), and the concentration
of tetracaine in the cerebrospinal fluid during spinal
anesthesia was in the range of approximately 50 – 400
␮m (27). thus, the concentrations of procaine and
tetracaine required to inhibit nmda receptors are
well within clinically relevant concentrations.
the potency for local anesthetics to produce both
tonic and phasic inhibition of sodium channels is dependent on their structure, hydrophobicity, and pka
(dissociation constants) (28,29). local anesthetics with
a more hydrophobic nature, such as tetracaine and
 xxxd383xxx , are more potent inhibitors of sodium

anesth analg
2002;94:325–30

channels than their less hydrophobic congeners. however, procaine, the least hydrophobic of the four local
anesthetics we examined, produced the most potent
inhibitory effect on the nmda receptors.
the effective form of local anesthetic is an important
factor in understanding how these compounds interact with ion channels. local anesthetics dissociate according to the pka and the ph of the solution. because
the pkas of procaine, tetracaine,  xxxd383xxx , and lidocaine are 8.9, 8.5, 8.1, and 7.9, respectively, the
degree of nmda receptor antagonism by a local anesthetic seems to be related to its pka. the larger the
pka, the higher the level of the cationic form at ph
7.45 and the more potently a local anesthetic inhibits
nmda-induced currents. the electrically charged cationic form of local anesthetics may be more active in
reducing nmda-induced currents.
procaine reduced the maximal current response of
the nmda receptor channels without affecting the
half-maximal concentration values, and this indicates
a noncompetitive antagonism of nmda receptor
channels by procaine. the inhibition by procaine exhibited voltage dependence and was more effective at
negative potentials, indicating that procaine can enter
the channel from the outside and bind to the site to
prevent na⫹ and ca2⫹ influx. location of the binding
site is estimated to be the halfway point of the channel.
lu and bieger (6) reported that neither etidocaine
nor procaine inhibited  xxxg981xxx  gated channels, such as (⫾)-␣-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole4-propionate (ampa) and nmda receptors, in rat
brainstem vagal motoneurons at concentrations up to 0.1
mm. however, our results clearly indicate the noncompetitive inhibition of nmda-induced currents. the discrepancy may be attributed to the difference of samples
(i.e., brain slices versus single neurons) and the neuronal
types investigated (nucleus ambiguus neurons versus
ca1 pyramidal neurons). it may be that procaine at a
concentration of 0.1 mm or less was not enough to
produce obvious inhibition of the nmda-induced currents, because the ic50 value obtained in our experiment
was 0.296 mm.
lu and bieger (6) also demonstrated that the currents through a nicotinic cholinoceptor, which is another ligand-gated cation channel, were blocked by
both etidocaine and procaine. furthermore, yost and
dodson (4) and cuevas and adams (5) demonstrated
that the inhibition of the  xxxg456xxx  by procaine was concentration dependent, voltage
dependent, and enhanced by hyperpolarization. this
is similar to our characterization of the effects of procaine on nmda receptors.
the nmda receptor antagonists inhibit pain sensitization (12) and protect against various sorts of brain
damage (13). local anesthetics themselves also block
pain propagation and reduce neuronal damage (16)
through voltage-gated sodium channel blockade. the

concentration of local anesthetics in the cerebrospinal
fluid is thought to reach hundreds of micromolar levels soon after the direct injection of local anesthetics
into humans. thus, the nmda receptor antagonist
properties of some local anesthetics may be clinically
relevant and beneficial for pain treatment. tetracaine
and  xxxd383xxx  are already in prevalent use as local
anesthetics for spinal or epidural anesthesia. procaine
might be the most promising local anesthetic for neuroprotection because, in addition to sodium channel
and nmda receptor blockade, it inhibits ryanodine
ca2⫹ release channels in the endoplasmic reticulum
(17).
in conclusion, we demonstrated that local anesthetics such as procaine and tetracaine inhibited nmdainduced currents in a concentration-dependent manner and that the mode of inhibition by procaine was
noncompetitive and channel-blocking. our results imply that some local anesthetics, which have nmda
antagonist property, may be more beneficial for pain
control and neuroprotection because nmda receptor
antagonists inhibit the progress of pain sensitization
and neuronal damage.
