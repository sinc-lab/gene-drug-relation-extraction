abstract
background:  xxxd1747xxx  is a nonpeptide vasopressin v 1an 2 -receptor antagonist that produces a controlled increase in serum sodium concentration in
hospitalized patients with euvolemic or hypervolemic hyponatremia.
objective: this study evaluated the pharmacokinetics of  xxxd1747xxx  in patients with euvolemic or
hypervolemic hyponatremia and with or without underlying congestive heart failure who were participating in an efficacy and tolerability clinical trial.
methods: data from an open-label, multicenter
study were used to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of
 xxxd1747xxx  in hyponatremic patients. patients received
a 20-mg loading dose intravenously over 30 minutes, followed by a continuous 4-day infusion of 20 or
40 mg/d. in the entire cohort, plasma  xxxd1747xxx  concentrations were determined at baseline, at the end of
the loading dose (0.5 hour), at 24 hours, on days 3
and 4, and at the follow-up visit on day 11. a subset
of patients at 2 study sites (the "pharmacokineticrich" subset) provided additional samples for pharmacokinetic analysis on day 1 at 1, 4, and 24 hours; on
day 2 at 24 hours; and on day 5 at 1, 2, 7, 12, and
24 hours.
results: plasma  xxxd1747xxx  concentrations were
evaluated in 31 patients who received  xxxd1747xxx 
20 mg/d (mean [sd] age, 73.1 [14.3] years; weight,
68.1 [17.2] kg; 71.0% female; 87.1% white, 9.7%
black, 3.2% other) and 172 patients who received  xxxd1747xxx  40 mg/d (mean [sd] age, 71.5 [14.4] years;
weight, 65.6 [15.9] kg; 64.0% female; 90.1 % white,
6.4% black, 3.5% other). the pharmacokineticrich subset included 8 patients who received  xxxd1747xxx  20 mg/d (mean [sd] age, 76.3 [12.4] years; weight,
1542

71.5 [14.7] kg; 87.5% female; 100% white) and 8
who received  xxxd1747xxx  40 mg/d (mean [sd] age,
78.3 [7.9] years; weight, 71.3 [15.6] kg; 37.5% female; 100% white). in the overall patient group,
plasma  xxxd1747xxx  concentrations were the highest
after the 30-minute (c o.5h ) loading dose (mean [sd]
c o. 5h = 733 [323] and 701 [343] ng/ml with  xxxd1747xxx  20 and 40 mg/d, respectively) and then declined
during day 1 to concentrations (c24h ) (mean [sd] c24h =
84 [78] and 215 [129] ng/ml with  xxxd1747xxx  20 and
40 mg/d, respectively) that were maintained by the
continuous infusion of 20 or 40 mg/d. at the end of
infusion (96 hours), the mean (sd) plasma  xxxd1747xxx 
concentrations were 176 (196) and 308 (321) ng/ml
for  xxxd1747xxx  20 and 40 mg/d, respectively. a ratio
of 1.75 indicated near dose proportionality; however,
interpatient variability was evident. no apparent differences in plasma  xxxd1747xxx  concentrations measured at 0.5 or 96 hours were observed between
patients with euvolemic or hypervolemic hyponatremia or between patients with or without congestive
heart failure. in the pharmacokinetic-rich subset, for
 xxxd1747xxx  20 and 40 mg/d, respectively,  xxxd1747xxx 
clearance was 18.7 and 9.5 l/h, the elimination t1/2
was 5.3 and 10.2 hours, and exposure to  xxxd1747xxx 
in terms of auc~ was 6996 and 30,771 ng . h/ml.
conclusion: the results of this study suggest that
the pharmacokinetics of  xxxd1747xxx  20 and 40 mg/d

introduction
hyponatremia, a serum sodium (na+) concentration
<135 meqll, is the most common electrolyte abnormality in hospitalized patients, occurring in 15% to
22 % of patients in general and at even higher rates
in the critically ill. l- 3 up to 7% of hospitalized patients have moderate hyponatremia, with serum na+
<130 meq/l,2,4 hyponatremia raises the risk of both
illness and death, particularly in conjunction with
congestive heart failure (chf) or liver cirrhosis. in
studies of chf, in-hospital complications and death
increased with concomitant hyponatremia by >2-fold,5
as did 30-day and 1-year mortality rates (by _50%).6
hospitalized patients with cirrhosis and hyponatremia died at a rate 3 times higher than did those
with normal serum na+,7
hyponatremia may be associated with elevated
levels of  xxxd3495xxx  (avp), a key hormone
that regulates body volume and plasma osmolality.8,9
low plasma osmolality normally suppresses the secretion of avp, but nonosmotic factors may drive its persistent elevation, leading to water retention and, in turn, dilutional hypo-osmolality and hyponatremia.lo,11 among
the conditions in which avp secretion may be inappropriately regulated are the syndrome of inappropriate secretion of  xxxd3495xxx , the most common cause of hyponatremia, and advanced chf,i,12,13
in patients with chf, hypervolemic hyponatremia can
develop as a compensatory response due to reduced
cardiac output and effective circulating volume, which
leads to water and sodium retention. 9 therefore, hyponatremia due to persistent elevations in avp may
occur in the setting of euvolemia or hypervolemia.
the treatment of euvolemic and hypervolemic hyponatremia depends largely on the presence of overt
symptoms and on the magnitude and rate of the decline in serum na+. 1,14 a controlled increase in serum
na+, with proper treatment, avoids the serious complications of persistent hyponatremia, such as seizures,
respiratory arrest, coma, and death, as well as the consequence of overly rapid correction, namely osmotic
demyelination. 14 for symptomatic patients, the comjuly 2009

bined infusion of hypertonic saline and a loop diuretic
is a common remedy, but the prompt increase in serum
na+ can be too fast (eg, >12 meqll in 24 hours),15
for asymptomatic patients, fluid restriction is the cornerstone of therapy, but demeclocycline, urea, and
lithium may also be used, despite variable efficacy or
tolerability. 9 none of these treatments addresses the
underlying effect of avp elevation.
 xxxd1747xxx '- is the first nonpeptide avp-receptor
antagonist approved by the us food and drug administration. 16 ,17 it is indicated for the treatment of
euvolemic and hypervolemic hyponatremia in hospitalized patients. 18 by blocking vasopressin v2 receptors,  xxxd1747xxx  produces aquaresis, a solute-free,
electrolyte-sparing increase in renal-water excretion,
which allows serum na+ to rise. 19 ,2o in clinical trials,
 xxxd1747xxx  increased serum na+ at a controlled, and
not overly rapid, rate in patients with euvolemic or
hypervolemic hyponatremia. 21 - 23 for example, in a
randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial,
29 patients were assigned to  xxxd1747xxx  40 mg and
26 patients were assigned to  xxxd1747xxx  80 mg, given
for 96 hours; 29 patients were assigned to placebo.
 xxxd1747xxx  40 mg/d increased serum na+ by ~6 meq/l
or to ~135 meq/l in 69% of patients, with a mean
increase of 6.3 meqll from baseline to the end of
treatment. 23 although not indicated as therapy for
chf,  xxxd1747xxx  can be used to treat hyponatremia in
hospitalized patients with underlying chf,18
the pharmacokinetics of  xxxd1747xxx  were determined in a preplanned analysis as part of a larger
open-label study (manuscript in preparation) in which
the efficacy and tolerability of  xxxd1747xxx  were evaluated in patients with euvolemic or hypervolemic hyponatremia and with or without chf,
patients and methods

study design
the open-label study involved 28 sites in the united states, israel, and south africa. the institutional
review board or independent ethics committee at each
site approved the protocol and amendments, and the
study was conducted in accordance with the principles
of the declaration of helsinki and good clinical prac-

tice, as well as all local regulatory requirements. the
study was monitored by cato research washington
(rockville, maryland). all patients provided written informed consent before enrolling in or undergoing any
study-related procedures.
eligible men and women were aged ;;:.18 years and
had a serum na+ ~130 meq/l on 2 separate measurements taken 4 to 24 hours apart and within 24 hours
of  xxxd1747xxx  administration, a blood glucose level
<275 mgldl, and clinical evidence of euvolemia (absence of pitting edema or ascites) or hypervolemia
(edema). patients with and without a history of chf
as indicated on the medical record were enrolled. female candidates of childbearing potential were using
a suitable method of birth control. reasons for exclusion included the following: clinical evidence of volume depletion or dehydration, hypotension (systolic
blood pressure [sbp] <85 mm hg or significant orthostatic hypotension [sbp reduction of >20 mm hg from
supine to standing, or a standing sbp <80 mm hg]),
uncontrolled hypertension (at the investigator's discretion), arrhythmias requiring emergent pacemaker
placement or treatment, thyroid disease or adrenal
insufficiency, creatinine clearance <20 mlimin, known
urinary-outflow obstruction, liver function tests (aspartate aminotransferase,  xxxg941xxx )
>5 times the upper limit of normal,  xxxg124xxx 
~1.5 gldl, or leukopenia <3000 cells/fll. coadministration of drugs that are substrates of the cytochrome
p450 (cyp) isozyme cyp3a4 was prohibited, but
patients taking such drugs could be enrolled if the
medications had been suspended for at least 3 halflives before administration of  xxxd1747xxx .
on day 1, eligible patients received a 20-mg loading dose of  xxxd1747xxx  as a 30-minute intravenous
infusion followed by a continuous infusion of 20 or
40 mgld for 4 days through a catheter inserted into a
large arm vein. the infusion site was changed every
24 hours to avoid local irritation.  xxxd1747xxx  40 mgld
was administered to patients enrolled under the initial
study protocol, whereas the 20-mgld dosage was given
to those enrolled after a protocol amendment in january 2005. the amended protocol allowed for the
study of this lower 20-mgld dosage in addition to the
previously studied 40-mgld dosage.
blood samples for analysis of plasma  xxxd1747xxx 
concentrations were drawn through an indwelling
cannula or by direct venipuncture from the arm opposite to the arm used for continuous infusion. blood
1544

was collected in prechilled 5-ml tubes containing
lithium-heparin before the first dose (0 hours); at the
end of the loading dose (0.5 hour); at 24 hours; and
on days 3,4, and 11. a subset of 27 patients at 2 study
sites (the "pharmacokinetic-rich" subset) provided additional samples for pharmacokinetic analysis on day
1 at 1,4, and 24 hours; on day 2 at 24 hours; and on
day 5 at 1,2, 7, 12, and 24 hours. samples were centrifuged to obtain plasma, which was stored at -20dc
until shipped for analysis. clinical and tolerability assessments were performed daily during treatment;
sodium and fluid intake and caloric consumption
were maintained at levels consistent with those at
screening. follow-up assessments were scheduled for
days 11 (± 1) and 34 (±2). a final blood sample for
analysis of plasma  xxxd1747xxx  concentration was collected at the day-11 visit.
pharmacokinetic analyses
a validated liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry method, with a lower limit of quantitation
of 0.5 nglml for  xxxd1747xxx , was used to determine
plasma  xxxd1747xxx  concentrations at astellas pharma
europe b. y. (leiderdorp, the netherlands). addition
of 50 fll of 56.4 nglml of internal standard (aya-319)
to a 0.5-ml plasma sample was followed by precipitation with 0.5 ml of 30% methanol. the sample was
centrifuged, and the supernatant was cleaned by solidphase extraction with a waters oasis hlb column
(waters corp., milford, massachusetts). the compound was eluted with 500 fll methanol, evaporated
to dryness, and redissolved in 250 fll of 30% methanol in 0.1 %  xxxd2154xxx . a 20-fll aliquot of the extracted sample was injected into a high-performance
liquid chromatography system consisting of a pump
(surveyor, thermo finnigan, breda, the netherlands),
an autosampler (215 sw liquid handler, gilson international b.y., leidschendam, the netherlands), a precolumn (phenomenex c18 cartridge, ods octadecy,
4 x 2.0 mm, bester b.y., amstelveen, the netherlands),
and a waters symmetry c i8 column (100 x 2.1 mm;
dp = 3 flm) maintained at 40 dc, and then eluted at a
flow rate of 0.30 mlimin with a mobile-phase gradient of water:methanol:acetonitrile:75 mm ammonium
formate buffer, ph 2.8 (47:35:8:10 [v:v:v:v] for
4.5 minutes, followed by 10:35:45:10 [v:v:v:v]
for 1.2 minutes). under these conditions,  xxxd1747xxx 
eluted at a mean retention time of 3.0 minutes (range,
2.7-3.3 minutes), and the internal standard eluted at
volume 31 number 7

z.l mao et a1.
3.6 minutes (range, 3.2-4.0 minutes). both were detected by means of a triple-stage quadrupole mass
spectrometer (tsq7000, thermo finnigan) with electrospray ionization interface.
a standard curve for the concentration of  xxxd1747xxx  in plasma was established for concentrations
ranging from 0.5 to 2000 ng/ml. the average correlation coefficient from the analysis was 0.9992. standard reference samples for calibration were prepared
with  xxxd1747xxx  concentrations of 0.5, 1.5, 15, 150,
and 1600 ng/ml. the precision established from these
quality controls ranged from 3.5% to 5.4%, and the
accuracy ranged from -1. 8% to 5.1 %.
noncompartmental methods using winnonlin version 5.0.1 (pharsight corp., mountain view, california) were applied to determine the following pharmacokinetic parameters of  xxxd1747xxx  from the plasma
concentrations measured in the pharmacokinetic-rich
subset: auc~, elimination rate constant (k e1 ) determined by regression of the plasma  xxxd1747xxx  concentration data during the log-elimination phase, elimination t1/2 calculated from in(2/k e1 ), and clearance (cl)
calculated from the total dose/auc~.
statistics
descriptive statistics were used to summarize plasma  xxxd1747xxx  concentrations and pharmacokinetic
parameters. concentrations below the lower limit of
quantitation were set to zero in the statistical description. pharmacokinetic comparisons were made between patients with euvolemic hyponatremia and
those with hypervolemic hyponatremia, and between
hyponatremic patients with chf and those without
chf. these comparisons used the plasma  xxxd1747xxx  concentrations measured at 0.5 hour (c o•5h ) and
96 hours (c 96h )-reflecting the maximum plasma concentration and the steady-state plasma concentration, respectively-in the entire study population, as
well as the auc~, k e1 , t 1/2 , and cl determined in the
pharmacokinetic-rich subset.
results
plasma  xxxd1747xxx  concentrations were measured in
203 patients, including 31 patients (15%) who received
 xxxd1747xxx  20 mg/d and 172 patients (85%) who received  xxxd1747xxx  40 mg/d. the mean (sd) age of the
study population was 72 (14) years, and 78% were
aged ;;:.65 years. most patients were female (132/203;
65%) and white (182/203; 90%). demographic charjuly 2009

actenstlcs were similar between the dosage groups,
and between the pharmacokinetic-rich subset and the
entire cohort (table i). of the 27 pharmacokineticrich patients originally studied, only 16 (59%) had
plasma  xxxd1747xxx  concentration measurements at all
time points with no missing or outlier data. nine of
the remaining 11 patients discontinued treatment prematurely and consequently lacked sufficient data for
pharmacokinetic profiling, and 2 patients had ;;:.1 outlier value for  xxxd1747xxx  concentration.
mean plasma  xxxd1747xxx  concentrations were the
highest after the 20-mg loading dose (c o.5h = 706 ng/ml
for the entire cohort) and then declined during day 1
to concentrations (mean [sd] c24h = 84 [78] and 215
[129] ng/ml with  xxxd1747xxx  20 and 40 mg/d, respectively) that were maintained by the continuous infusion
of 20 or 40 mg/d (figure). eighteen of the 203 patients
(9%) had measurable plasma  xxxd1747xxx  concentrations in predose samples. because it was not possible for plasma  xxxd1747xxx  concentrations to exist before actual dosing, baseline samples in those patients
were likely taken inadvertently after the loadingdose administration had begun. plasma  xxxd1747xxx 
concentrations varied considerably during the infusion,
with coefficients of variation >100% at some sample
times. by the end of the 4-day continuous infusion,
c 96h averaged 308 ng/ml among all patients receiving
40 mg/d, compared with 176 ng/ml in all patients receiving 20 mg/d (table 11). the ratio of mean c 96h values at 40 mg/d compared with 20 mg/d was 1.75, indicating near dose proportionality in plasma  xxxd1747xxx 
concentrations at the end of the infusion. no apparent
differences in c o•5h or c 96h were observed between patients with euvolemic hyponatremia and those with
hypervolemic hyponatremia, or between patients with
and those without chf (table 11).
in the pharmacokinetic-rich subset,  xxxd1747xxx  cl
was -2 times slower with the 40-mg/d dosage than the
20-mg/d dosage (9.5 vs 18.7 l/h); the elimination t1/2
doubled with the higher dosage (10.2 vs 5.3 hours)
(table iii). as a result, exposure in terms of auc~ to
 xxxd1747xxx  was -4 times greater with 40 mg/d than
with 20 mg/d (30,771 vs 6996 ng' hlml). in contrast,
when cl was estimated from the concentration at the
end of infusion (96 hours) for all patients, it was approximately the same for the 40-mg/d and 20-mg/d
dosages (mean, 17.0 vs 15.7 l/h). patients with hypervolemic or euvolemic hyponatremia demonstrated a
similar profile: cl was -2 times slower and exposure

was 3 to 5 times higher with  xxxd1747xxx  40 mg/d than
with 20 mg/d (table iii). considering the large interpatient variability, the pharmacokinetics of  xxxd1747xxx  in the euvolemic population did not differ from
those in hypervolemic patients at the 2 dose levels.
any differences in mean values were comparatively
smaller than the interpatient variability reflected in
the sd values.
similarly, in the subgroups with and without chf,
the slower cl of  xxxd1747xxx  40 mg/d compared with
20 mg/d was accompanied by corresponding increases
in t1/2 and auc~ (table iii). the pharmacokinetic profile of  xxxd1747xxx  in the subset given 20 mg/d, particularly the high cl and low auc~, presumably reflected
the small sample size. in view of the large interpatient
variability, the pharmacokinetics of  xxxd1747xxx  did not
differ in the presence or absence of chf.

discussion
the pharmacokinetic profile of  xxxd1747xxx , whether
administered at 20 or 40 mg/d, did not appear to differ according to volume or chf status, as the present
study suggests. plasma  xxxd1747xxx  concentrations were
highest after the 20-mg loading dose and decreased during day 1 to a concentration that was maintained by the
continuous infusion of 20 or 40 mg/d. after reaching a
nadir, plasma  xxxd1747xxx  concentrations remained constant or rose gradually during the infusion, achieving
steady state after 2 to 4 days. at the end of the 4-day
infusion, the mean concentration was nearly dose proportional (ratio of c 96h at 40 mg/d to c 96h at 20 mg/d
= 1. 75). however, pronounced interpatient variability
(%cy, 82% for 20 mg/d; 118% for 40 mg/d) in
plasma  xxxd1747xxx  concentrations was observed across
all sampling times. in a previous single-dose study,

 xxxd1747xxx  displayed dose-proportional pharmacokinetics over the range of 10 to 40 mg in patients with
hyponatremia and chf, but pronounced interpatient
variability was also evident. 24

the aquaretic effect of  xxxd1747xxx , characterized by a
large (-2000 ml) increase in effective water clearance,
occurs on the first day of dosing, as does a resultant
rise in serum na+. over the subsequent 3 days when
plasma drug concentrations are near or at steady-state
levels,  xxxd1747xxx  exerts a more gradual effect on effective water clearance and serum na+. 18 thus, the
pharmacodynamic properties of  xxxd1747xxx  appear to
reflect its pharmacokinetic profile; however, a formal
pharmacokineticlpharmacodynamic analysis is necessary to confirm this supposition.
the present study has several limitations. because
of the relatively small pharmacokinetic-rich population (only 16 evaluable patients), high interpatient
variability could have limited the sensitivity for detecting meaningful differences in pharmacokinetics
between the volume- and chf-status subgroups. for
example, in the pharmacokinetic-rich subset, slower
cl with the 40-mg/d dosage approximately doubled
the elimination t1/2 and produced a nearly 4-fold increase in exposure to  xxxd1747xxx  as reflected by the
auc~. in contrast, when cl was estimated from the
concentration at the end of infusion (96 hours) in all
patients, it was approximately the same for the 20and 40-mg/d dosages. moreover, the small number of
sampling times after the loading dose on day 1 and at
steady state also introduced variability into the pharmacokinetic assessment. in addition, measurable plasma  xxxd1747xxx  concentrations were detected in predose samples from 18 patients (9%). because plasma
 xxxd1747xxx  concentrations could not be present before
dosing, it was determined that baseline samples were
inadvertently taken in these patients after administration of the loading dose had begun. nevertheless, the
pharmacokinetic profiles appeared similar regardless
of volume status (euvolemic or hypervolemic) or chf
status (present or absent) and regardless of the data
set used for their calculation; these results are consistent with a lack of pharmacokinetic differences between these subsets. in addition, in the efficacy analysis of the present study, the effect of  xxxd1747xxx  on
serum na+ was consistent in all subgroups, suggesting
that any pharmacokinetic differences are minor and
smaller than the interpatient variability.25,26
conclusion
the pharmacokinetics of  xxxd1747xxx  20 and 40 mg/d
did not appear to differ by volume status or chf
status in the present study.
