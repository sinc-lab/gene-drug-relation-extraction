limited capacity for ammonia removal by brain in
chronic liver failure: potential role of  xxxd2738xxx 
christopher rose1 and vicente felipo1,2

chronic liver failure leads to hyperammonemia and consequently increased brain ammonia
concentrations, resulting in hepatic encephalopathy. when the liver fails to regulate ammonia concentrations, the brain, devoid of a urea cycle, relies solely on the amidation of
glutamate to glutamine through  xxxg913xxx , to efficiently clear ammonia. surprisingly, under hyperammonemic conditions, the brain is not capable of increasing its
capacity to remove ammonia, which even decreases in some regions of the brain. this
non-induction of  xxxg913xxx  in astrocytes could result from possible limiting
substrates or cofactors for the enzyme, or an indirect effect of ammonia on glutamine
synthetase expression. in addition, there is evidence that nitration of the enzyme resulting
from exposure to  xxxd2738xxx  could also be implicated. the present review summarizes
these possible factors involved in limiting the increase in capacity of  xxxg913xxx 
in brain, in chronic liver failure.
key words: chronic liver failure; ammonia;  xxxg913xxx ;  xxxd2738xxx ; hepatic encephalopathy.

introduction
there is a substantial body of evidence to suggest that ammonia has adverse effects
on the brain and is therefore believed to play a major role in the pathogenesis of the
neuropsychiatric disturbances observed in hepatic encephalopathy. when liver, the major
ammonia-removing organ in the body, fails and is incapable of efficiently converting
ammonia to urea or glutamine, hyperammonemia develops, leading to increased levels
of ammonia in the brain. unlike liver, brain is devoid of an effective urea cycle and
therefore relies entirely on glutamine synthesis for the removal of blood-borne ammonia.
 xxxg913xxx  (gs) is strictly an astrocytic enzyme, which is responsible for the
 xxxd83xxx  (atp)-dependent amidation of glutamate to glutamine:
glutamate + nh4 + + atp → glutamine + adp + pi
this specific reaction proceeds via a gamma -glutamyl phosphate intermediate, and is
dependent upon the presence of divalent cations such as manganese (mn2+ ).

 xxxg913xxx  in chronic liver failure
portal hypertension is a serious complication of chronic liver failure and is relieved
either naturally from spontaneous collaterals between the portal vein and the systemic
venous circulation, or surgically (as treatment) with a portacaval anastomosis or more
commonly used today, transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (tips). in either case,
portal-systemic shunting results in an increase in blood and brain ammonia, and hepatic
encephalopathy developes.
in rats, 4 weeks following portacaval anastomosis, girard et al. (1993) found an increase
in brain ammonia and a concomitant decrease of gs activity in the brain. this finding
was region selective, being observed in 3/7 brain regions (cerebral cortex, cerebellum,
and hippocampus) (fig. 1) with no change found in the other regions. using the same
model, studies by butterworth et al. (1988) revealed a similar reduction in gs activity
in cerebral cortex, and more recently desjardins et al. (1999) reported similar findings in
both cerebral cortex and cerebellum. cooper et al. (1985) on the other hand did not find
a decrease in gs activity and found no change in whole brain from portacaval-shunted
rats. others were unable to detect any significant increase in net glutamine synthesis in
brain, following portacaval anastomosis (cremer et al., 1975; ukida et al., 1988). many
possible explanations have been forwarded (see later) to explain why the capacity of brain
gs to remove ammonia is not increased to compensate for the elevated brain ammonia
concentrations, in chronic liver failure. cooper et al. (1985) showed that gs activity in
the brain operates at near maximal capacity under normal physiological conditions and
that induction does not occur. this lack of induction or, even worse, decrease of brain
gs activity is a likely explanation for the precipitously high levels of brain ammonia in
conditions of chronic liver failure (butterworth et al., 1988).

factors involved in limiting  xxxg913xxx 
capacity to remove ammonia
cell (astrocyte) loss
chronic liver failure does not result in significant loss of neural cells (i.e., neurons
or astrocytes) in the brain (butterworth, 2003). it is therefore highly unlikely that the
reductions in the activity of gs in brain reported following portacaval anastomosis are the
consequence of the loss of cells rich in this enzyme, since neuropathologic studies do not
reveal evidence of astrocytic cell loss. however, alterations of the functional integrity of
astrocytes have been described (norenberg, 1987).

decreased protein or gene expression
it has been shown that the loss of activity of the gs enzyme is not associated with the
loss of gs protein or gene expression in the brains of portacaval-shunted rats (desjardins
et al., 1999).

limited concentrations of  xxxg913xxx  enzyme substrate
with increasing concentrations of ammonia in the brain during chronic liver failure,
it is obvious that the amidation of glutamate to glutamine is not limited by the substrate
ammonia in the pathogenesis of hepatic encephalopathy. however, many other factors may
be altered, resulting in a decrease or non-induction of gs in astrocytes.
glutamate is the substrate for gs, and therefore a decrease or increase in intracellular
glutamate may affect gs activity. termination of the action of glutamate in the synaptic
cleft relies to a significant degree on its reuptake by high-affinity glutamate transporters
into perineuronal astrocytes where glutamate is transformed via gs into glutamine. studies
in astrocytes cultured from different brain regions of the rat demonstrate that the capacity
for glutamate uptake correlates with regional gs activities (hansson et al., 1986). in
chronic liver failure, using in vivo microdialysis, no increase in extracellular glutamate
was observed in cerebral cortex (rao et al., 1995) or striatum (tossman et al., 1983) of
rats with portacaval anastomosis. it has been demonstrated that chronic hyperammonemia
results in a region-selective loss of glutamate transporter sites. however, desjardins and
butterworth found no change in gene expression of the astrocytic glutamate transporters
eaac-1 and eaac-2 in cerebral cortex of rats with portacaval anastomosis (unpublished
results). on the contrary, suarez et al. (2000) described a significant loss of both astrocytic
and neuronal glutamate transporter expression in cerebellum of portacaval-shunted rats
(suarez et al., 2000). in brain tissue, concentrations of glutamate have been found to be
decreased in portacaval-shunted rats (giguere and butterworth, 1984; hindfelt et al., 1977;
gjedde et al., 1978) (fig. 2). together this data provides evidence to support that glutamate
availability may be limited in some brain structures of portacaval-shunted rats. on the
countray, whether concentrations of glutamate in the astrocyte compartment (available to
gs) are reduced remains unclear.

each of the 12 active sites of gs requires two mn+ ions, a metallic ion whose availability is not limited in chronic liver failure. on the contrary, it has been demonstrated that
increased manganese deposition occurs in the brain (more specifically in the basal ganglia)
of patients with chonic liver failure (rose et al., 1999) and with spontaneous or surgicallyinduced portal-systemic shunting (spahr et al., 1996). similar observations were found in
rats with both portal-systemic shunting and liver dysfunction (fig. 3). these results suggest
that in chronic liver failure, manganese availability is adequate to maintain gs activity.

and analyzed using western blot for the presence of tyrosine-nitrated gs (no2 tyr-gs). (b) densimetric quantification of tyrosine nitration of gs (modified from schliess et al., 2002).

gs is an atp-dependent enzyme. although ammonia has been shown to inhibit alphaketoglutarate dehydrogenase in the tricarboxylic acid (tca) cycle with the potential to
cause energy impairment, no evidence of energy failure has been reported in the brains of
rats with chronic liver failure (hindfelt et al., 1977).
there is recent evidence to suggest that a decrease in gs activity can also result
from nitration of its tyrosine residues, leading to a loss of enzymatic activity. ammoniainduced tyrosine nitration of many proteins has been demonstrated in both in vivo (4week portacaval-shunted rats) (fig. 4) and in vitro models of hyperammonemia (schliess
et al., 2002). it has been demonstrated in vitro (cultured astrocytes) that an increase in
gs tyrosine nitration induced by ammonia is accompanied with a ∼30% decrease in
gs activity (schliess et al., 2002). tyrosine nitration is mediated by reactive nitrogen
species such as peroxynitrite anion (onoo− ) and nitrogen dioxide (• no2 ), formed as
secondary products of  xxxd2738xxx  (• no) metabolism in the presence of oxidants including superoxide radicals (o2 − ), and  xxxd2298xxx  (h2 o2 ). • no diffuses freely across
cell membranes and is believed to play a major role in the nitration of gs.  xxxd2738xxx  synthase (nos) catalyses the production of • no with the oxidation of l-arginine to
 xxxd2429xxx .
arginine + 2nadph + 2o2 → citrulline + nadp + 2h2 o
an increase in • no production could lead to increased production of reactive nitrogen
species and hence nitration of gs, lowering its capacity to remove ammonia.

l-arginine is the obligate substrate for nos reaction; its intracellular availability
depends exclusively on its transport. there is convincing evidence for a stimulatory effect
of ammonia on cellular l-arginine uptake. for example, hyperammonemia increases the
transport of l-[3 h]arginine into synaptosomes of portacaval-shunted rats, and precipitation
of severe encephalopathy following ammonia administration to these rats results in a
further increase in synaptosomal l-[3 h]arginine uptake (rao et al., 1997a). furthermore,
hyperammonemia without liver dysfunction also stimulates arginine uptake by increasing
the vmax without changing the affinity of l-arginine for the transporter. it was demonstrated
that increased nos activity was not responsible for the increased l-arginine uptake (rao
et al., 1997a). none of the nos inhibitors studied (l-name, l-noarg,  xxxd3291xxx ) had
any effect on the ammonia-induced increase in synaptosomal l-arginine uptake, suggesting
that ammonia directly activates the transport of l-arginine and that inhibition of nos has
little, if any, effect on this process. furthermore, rao et al. (1995) found that increased nos
activities were the consequence of increased availability of the enzyme substrate l-arginine.
overall, ammonia-induced l-arginine uptake is an important pathway in regulating nos
activity.
there are three different genes encoding nos: (1)  xxxg1577xxx  (nos-1), which until recently,
was considered to be expressed only in neurons; (2) inos (nos-2), the inducible form,
usually found in macrophages and turned on by an appropriate stimulus; and (3) enos
(nos-3) found in the endothelial cells that line the lumen of blood vessels.  xxxg1577xxx  and enos
are constitutively expressed and synthesize • no in response to increases in intracellular
calcium. rao et al. (1997b) reported an increased  xxxg1577xxx  protein and mrna expression in
the brains of portacaval-shunted rats (fig. 5).
calcium is an important regulator of nos, acting through the binding of calmodulin.
felipo and colleagues demonstrated that ammonia-induced increases of nos activity are

figure 6. hypothesis whereby ammonia stimulates l-arginine uptake into the cell, which activates
nos, resulting in an increased production of no and consequently tyrosine nitration of gs. even
though gs is localized in astrocytes, the source of no is yet to be defined, as nos is found in both
neurons and astrocytes (baltrons and garcia, 2001).

dependent upon n-methyl d-aspartate (nmda) receptor activation, resulting in an opening
of the ion channel and entry of calcium. this leads to activation of soluble  xxxg1587xxx ,
leading to an increased formation of  xxxd1274xxx  (cgmp). part of the
cgmp formed is released into the extracellular space where it can be collected and served
as a marker of nmda-receptor-mediated nos activity. this pathway is blocked by the pretreatment of mk-801, a glutamate (nmda) receptor antagonist (hermenegildo et al., 1996,
2000). overactivation of nmda receptors leading to an increase in nmda/nos/cgmp
pathway has been shown to occur in acute hyperammonemia (marcaida et al., 1992;
montoliu et al., 2002). however, in chronic liver failure, overactivation of nmda receptors does not occur. peterson et al. demonstrated a region-selective reduction of nmda
receptor densities in brains of portacaval-shunted rats (peterson et al., 1990). it is therefore
unlikely that nmda-receptor-mediated increases of the no–cgmp signal transduction
pathway are responsible for gs nitration in chronic liver failure.
in summary, under hyperammonemic conditions, the brain is not capable of increasing its capacity to remove ammonia via its principal ammonia-removing mechanism, the
astrocytic gs pathway. a review of currently available evidence supports the view that
the reduction in gs capacity in brain (or lack of its induction, depending upon the brain
region) in chronic liver failure does not result from a limitation in availability of substrates
(nh4 + , glutamate) or cofactors (atp, mn2+ ). the most likely explanation is gs nitration
resulting from ammonia-induced increased synthesis of no. this later mechanism appears
to be independent of nmda activation but dependent upon l-arginine (fig. 6).
