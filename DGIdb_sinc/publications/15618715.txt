summary: the active transport of solutes mediated by the  xxxg11xxx  ( xxxg11xxx  w
 xxxg11xxx ) and
 xxxg16xxx -2 ( xxxg15xxx  w
 xxxg15xxx ) are thought to involve bile acid-dependent
and -independent bile formation, respectively. to evaluate the potential of therapeutic agents as inhibitors of such transporters on bile canalicular membranes, we examined the inhibition of the primary active
transport of typical substrates by 15 drugs, clinically known to cause cholestasis in canalicular membrane vesicles. the inhibition by most of the compounds in rat canalicular membrane vesicles (cmvs)
was minimal or observed at much higher concentrations than obtained in clinical situations. however,
cloxacillin,  xxxd1781xxx  and midecamycin inhibited  xxxg11xxx , and  xxxd1781xxx  and midecamycin inhibited  xxxg15xxx  with an inhibition constant close to the clinical concentration. by comparing the inhibition
potential between rat and human cmvs, the inhibition of  xxxg11xxx - and  xxxg15xxx -mediated transport by
midecamycin and  xxxd1781xxx  was relatively similar whereas the inhibitory ešect on  xxxg11xxx -mediated
transport by cloxacillin and  xxxd2215xxx  was more marked in humans than in rats. these results suggest that the majority of cholestasis-inducing drugs have a minimal inhibitory ešect on rat  xxxg11xxx  and
 xxxg15xxx  although species dišerences in inhibitory potential should be considered, especially in the case of
 xxxg11xxx .

cholestasis may occur via interference with the
unidirectional transport of biliary constituents across
the canalicular membrane because of hereditary or
acquired impairment as a secondary consequence of
structural damage to hepatocytes and the bile duct.
recently, hereditary defects of speciˆc transporter
molecules in canaliculi have been identiˆed as playing a
role in the pathogeneses of certain forms of cholestasis.
strautnieks et al. have reported that progressive familial
intrahepatic cholestasis-2 ( xxxg11xxx ) is caused by a lack
of  xxxg11xxx .2) it has also been reported that a hereditary
mutation of  xxxg15xxx  leads to hyperbilirubinemia with
cholestasis known as dubin-johnson syndrome.3)
in addition to these hereditary forms, cholestasis
induced by drugs and other xenobiotic substances is a

introduction
continuous bile formation is an important function
of the mammalian liver. it is an osmotic secretory process that is driven by the concentration gradient of bile
salts and other biliary constituents across the bile
canaliculi.1) the transport of solutes from blood to bile
is driven by several active transport systems in the plasma membranes of both the basolateral (sinusoidal) and
apical (canalicular) surfaces of hepatocytes. the active
transport of solutes across the latter membrane is
thought to be the rate-limiting step in bile formation
under physiological conditions.1)
bile secretion has been traditionally divided into two
components. one is the bile acid-dependent bile ‰ow
which is related to the excretion of bile salts mediated by
 xxxg11xxx ) in canalicuthe  xxxg11xxx  ( xxxg11xxx  w
li. the other is the bile acid-independent bile ‰ow,
involving the passive excretion of inorganic electrolytes

potential of various therapeutic agents as inhibitors of  xxxg11xxx  and  xxxg15xxx 

common problem in clinical medicine. a great deal of
ešort has been devoted to investigate the mechanisms of
cholestasis, although the pathogenesis of drug-induced
cholestasis remains unknown. recently, several
cholestatic compounds have been found to interact with
the export of bile acids and some organic anions at the
canalicular atp-dependent transporters including
 xxxg11xxx  and  xxxg15xxx . the immunosuppressant,  xxxd1781xxx , has been found to inhibit both  xxxg11xxx  and  xxxg15xxx 
in vitro.4) similar mechanisms involving transporters
were recently postulated for rifamycin, rifampicin and
 xxxd2215xxx .5) therefore, it would be desirable in drug
screening and evaluation processes to exclude any compounds which exhibit cholestatic potential by inhibiting
transport across the bile canalicular membrane.
isolated canalicular membrane vesicles (cmvs) have
been used to evaluate the transport systems on the
membranes in vitro. as far as certain series of
compounds which are reported to induce cholestasis are
concerned, it has not been systemically examined yet
whether or not transporter inhibition on bile canalicular
membrane involves cholestasis. therefore, in the
present study, examining the possible involvement of
transporter inhibition in drug-induced cholestasis, we
have investigated the inhibitory ešects of 15 compounds, which cause cholestasis in clinical situations, on
both  xxxg11xxx  and  xxxg15xxx  using cmvs. in addition, we
have also evaluated the possibility of species dišerences
in the inhibitory ešects of several compounds between
rats and humans.
materials and methods
materials:  xxxd161xxx , chlorpromazine, cloxacillin, colchicine,  xxxd1781xxx , doxycycline,  xxxd2215xxx , ketoconazole, midecamycin, minocycline,
quinidine, sulpiride, tetracycline, ticlopidine, verapamil, atp, amp, creatine phosphate, and creatine
phosphokinase were purchased from sigma (st.louis,
nmol) and
mo). [3h] xxxd3296xxx  ([3h]tca, 3.47 mci w
[3h]glutathione (50.0 mci w
nmol) were purchased from
new england nuclear (boston, ma). [3h]s-(2,4dinitrophenyl)-glutathione (dnp-sg, 50.0 mci w
nmol)
was synthesized by the method described by saxena and
henderson.6) all other chemicals were commercial
products of analytical grade.
isolation of cmvs from human and rat liver: the
human liver sample (from a female caucasian, aged 21,
who died from head trauma) was provided by sri international (menlo park, ca) and its shipment to sri was
coordinated by the national disease research interchange (philadelphia, pa). cmvs from one human and
six male sprague-dawley rats (250¿320 g, japan slc,
hamamatsu, japan) were prepared as described previously.7) the purity of the prepared cmvs was checked
by determining the activity of alkaline phosphatase

study was also checked by measuring the atp-dependent uptake of standard substrates, [3h]tca and
[3h]dnp-sg. atp-dependent uptake was obtained by
subtraction of the uptake in the presence of amp
(atp-independent) from that in the presence of atp.
the activities of cmvs used in the present study under
control conditions were as follows. [3h]tca (1 mm,

major part of uptake clearance of cmvs in the presence
of atp was atp-dependent both in rats and human.
uptake study by cmvs: the inhibition studies for
 xxxg11xxx  and  xxxg15xxx  using various organic anions were
performed as follows:  xxxd161xxx , chlorpromazine,
cloxacillin, colchicine,  xxxd1781xxx , doxycycline,
 xxxd2215xxx , ketoconazole, midecamycin, minocycline, quinidine, sulpiride, tetracycline, ticlopidine and
verapamil were dissolved in  xxxd1896xxx  and
diluted with 10 mm tris-250 mm sucrose bušer (ph
7.4). the ˆnal concentration of  xxxd1896xxx  in
each assay mixture was 0.3z except for  xxxd1781xxx 
(0.5z). the inhibition study was performed as reported
previously.7)
data analysis: the data analysis was performed as
reported previously.8) brie‰y, the inhibition constants
(ki ) for the uptake of tca and dnp-sg by cmvs were
obtained by ˆtting data to the following equations:
v(－i)＝1 w
(1＋iu w
ki )
v(＋i) w

eq (1)

where v(＋i) and v(－i) represent the atp-dependent
transport velocity in the presence or absence of an inhibitor, respectively, and iu is the inhibitor concentration
in the medium ( mm). this equation was derived based
on the assumption of competitive inhibition and the fact
that the tca and dnp-sg concentrations (1 mm) were
much lower than the km values (12.6 and 20.6 mm for
tca and 21.0 and 193 mm for dnp-sg in rats and

18

humans, respectively).7) the ˆtting was performed by an
iterative nonlinear least-squares method with a multi
program,9) to obtain estimates of ki. the input data
were weighted as the reciprocal of the square of the
observed values.
the clinically relevant concentrations of inhibitors
were estimated from the following equation.10–12)
fu･iinãfu･(imax＋fa･dose･ka w

eq (2)

where fu represents the plasma unbound fraction of the
inhibitor. imax is the reported value for the maximum
concentration in the systemic circulation and iin is the
maximum inhibitor concentration at the inlet to the
liver. fa represents the absorbed fraction of the inhibitor, assumed to be 1. the doses of inhibitors administered were those given in publications. the term,
ka, is the absorption rate constant and we chose
0.1 min－1 taking the maximum gastric emptying time
(10 min) into consideration. qh represents the hepatic
blood ‰ow rate in humans (1610 ml w

statistical analysis: the results are shown as mean
±se for the number of determinations. dunnett's posthoc test was used to determine the signiˆcance of dišerences between the mean of two groups, with pº0.05 as
the minimum levels of dišerence.
results
compounds selected in the present study: all the
compounds (except colchicine) have been reported to
produce clinical cholestasis.  xxxd1781xxx  has been
demonstrated to induce cholestasis in clinical situations,
causing an increase in serum bilirubin and bile acids and
a decrease in plasma bromosulfophthalein clearance.13)
chlorpromazine has been also shown to cause cholestatic jaundice with an incidence of 1¿2z in clinical
situations.14)  xxxd161xxx , cloxacillin, doxycycline,
 xxxd2215xxx , ketoconazole, midecamycin, minocycline, quinidine, sulpiride, tetracycline, ticlopidine and
verapamil have been reported to cause cholestatic
symptoms in clinical situations (at least 1¿15 case
or
reports each) as shown by liver function tests and w
liver biopsies. as for colchicine, no cholestasis has been
described in clinical situations, although it reduces bile
‰ow with leakage of lactate dehydrogenase into bile in
rats and increases both serum  xxxd2431xxx  oxaloacetic
transaminase (sgot) and alkaline phosphatase (alp)
in patients.15,16)
inhibition of atp-dependent uptake of tca and
dnp-sg by cmvs: the inhibitory ešects of several
compounds on the atp-dependent uptake of tca and
dnp-sg by rat cmvs are shown in fig. 1. the tca
uptake was inhibited by chlorpromazine, cloxacillin,
colchicine, doxycycline,  xxxd2215xxx ,  xxxd1781xxx ,
midecamycin, quinidine and verapamil (fig. 1a, b),
whereas chlorpromazine, colchicine,  xxxd1781xxx ,

minocycline and midecamycin inhibited dnp-sg
uptake in a concentration- dependent manner (fig. 1c).
the ki values obtained are shown in table 1. the ki
values for inhibition of tca uptake by  xxxd1781xxx 
and  xxxd2215xxx  were similar to the previously
published data (0.8 and 8.6 mm, respectively).17)
when the relative ratio of the clinical concentration
to the ki value was calculated based on the maximum
unbound concentration of each compound in circulating plasma (fu･imax ), the obtained ratios were less than
0.05 (no inhibition) except for the inhibition of tca
uptake by cloxacillin (table 1). when the relative ratio
of the clinical concentration to the ki value was calculated based on the maximum unbound concentration at the
inlet to the liver (fu･iin ), most of ratios were still close to
0.05 except for the inhibition of tca uptake by cloxacillin,  xxxd1781xxx  and midecamycin and that of
dnp-sg uptake by  xxxd1781xxx  and midecamycin
(table 1).
to obtain an insight into any species dišerence in
such inhibition potential, the compounds with a ratio
less than 0.014 were selected and their ešect on the
uptake of tca and dnp-sg in human cmvs was
examined (fig. 2). here, the chosen concentration of
each compound was the ki (half-inhibitory concentration) observed in rats. the tca uptake in the presence
of midecamycin and  xxxd1781xxx  was 51.3 and 29.0z
of the control, showing inhibition comparable to that
exhibited by rat cmvs, whereas that in the presence of
cloxacillin and  xxxd2215xxx  was much lower than
50z, suggesting greater inhibition in human cmvs
(fig. 2). chlorpromazine, midecamycin and  xxxd1781xxx  exhibited slight or minimal inhibition (80¿100z
of control) of dnp-sg uptake in human cmvs (fig. 2).
discussion
cholestasis caused by several therapeutic drugs has
been suggested to involve the inhibition of transporters
localized on the bile canalicular membranes. bohme et
al. have reported that  xxxd1781xxx  inhibits the atpdependent transport of tca and leukotriene c4 (ltc4 )
with ki values of 0.2 and 3.4 mm, respectively, in rat
cmvs, and that the bile ‰ow rate is reduced to 50z of
kg) in
baseline after  xxxd1781xxx  injection (25 mg w
vivo in rats.4,33) funk et al. have also demonstrated that
troglitazone, an insulin-sensitizing drug for type 2 noninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, and its major
metabolite, troglitazone sulfate, inhibit atp-dependent
tca transport with a ki of 1.3 and 0.23 mm, respectively, in rat cmvs and i.v. injection of troglitazone
(25 mg w
kg) increases plasma bile acid concentrations in
vivo.17) thus, at least some cholestatic agents inhibit the
primary active transport mediated by  xxxg11xxx  and w
or
 xxxg15xxx . this led us to systematically examine the inhibition potential of 15 compounds, reported to exhibit the

concentration of each compound at 379c, respectively. the atp-dependent uptake was calculated by subtracting the uptake in the absence of
atp from that in its presence and shown as normalized values with respect to control values. each data point represents the mean±se of 3 experiments from 6 preparations.

fig. 2. inhibition of the primary active transport of tca and dnp-sg by therapeutic agents in human cmvs‚
cmvs were incubated with 1 mm tca (a, incubation time 1 min) or dnp-sg (b, incubation time 2 min) in the presence of each compound at a
concentration equal to the ki values obtained in rat cmvs. the atp-dependent uptake was calculated by subtracting the uptake in the absence of

cholestatic activity, on  xxxg11xxx  and w
or  xxxg15xxx  in present
study.
among the compounds examined, chlorpromazine,
cloxacillin, colchicine,  xxxd1781xxx , doxycycline,
 xxxd2215xxx , midecamycin, quinidine and verapamil
inhibited  xxxg11xxx  with a ki of 1.09–542 mm, whereas
chlorpromazine, colchicine,  xxxd1781xxx , midecamycin and minocycline inhibited  xxxg15xxx  with a ki of
1.96–975 mm (table 1). all the other compounds only
minimally inhibit both transporters (table 1). in addior
tion, by comparing the obtained ki with fu･imax and w
fu･iin, for most of the compounds, except cloxacillin
for  xxxg11xxx , inhibition of the transporters seems to be
observed at much higher concentrations than those seen
in clinical situations. thus, despite their cholestatic
activity, most of the therapeutic drugs produce only
minimal inhibition of  xxxg11xxx  and  xxxg15xxx , implying that
the inhibition by the metabolites of parent compounds,
as in case of troglitazone, or other mechanisms for their
cholestatic activity need to be considered.
to discuss in more quantitative terms the relationship
between the inhibition of these transporters and the
observed cholestasis, further information is needed. in
particular, the inhibitory activity of these therapeutic
drugs may exhibit a species dišerence between rats and
humans. as a ˆrst step to obtain such information, the
inhibition in human cmvs was also examined for the
compounds showing inhibitory ešects in rat cmvs. as
far as the inhibition of dnp-sg transport was concerned, the inhibitory activity of the three compounds
examined was relatively weak in humans, whereas the
inhibition of tca transport by cloxacillin and  xxxd2215xxx  was more marked in humans than in rats
(fig. 2), suggesting a possible species dišerence for
 xxxg11xxx . we previously reported that the marker enzyme

activities, enrichment factors, sideness and yields of
cmvs were basically similar between rats and humans.7)
because these values in the present studies were almost
identical to previous data,7) the species dišerence found
in the present study was considered to be an intrinsic
dišerence and independent of characterization. we also
reported a dišerence in the km for the primary active
transport of organic anions and tca between human
and rat cmvs,7) supporting a possible species dišerence
in the a‹nity of primary active transport systems. it has
been shown that the homologies in the amino acid sequences of  xxxg11xxx  and  xxxg15xxx  between rats and humans
are about 82 and 78z, respectively.34,35) the homologies
of active sites, which interact with inhibitors, are still
unknown, however, and it is possible that these dišerences in amino acid sequence may result in a large dišerence in transporter inhibition. as for cloxacillin and
 xxxd2215xxx , both compounds were reported to
increase serum bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase,
leading to clinical jaundice. in addition, liver biopsy
specimens from jaundiced patients treated with these
compounds revealed the cholestatic ability of these
agents.36,37) needless to say, to assess the degree of inhibition potential using human cmvs more precisely, a
comparison between the ki values and clinically relevant
concentrations is needed. therefore, to examine the
possible involvement of  xxxg11xxx  inhibition in their
cholestatic activity, further quantitative analysis should
be performed.
considering that  xxxg11xxx  and  xxxg15xxx  are localized on
bile canalicular membranes, the estimation of the inhibition of these transporters should be performed using
the hepatic unbound concentration rather than the plasma unbound concentration. therefore, the concentrative uptake of these therapeutic drugs in human hepato-

potential of various therapeutic agents as inhibitors of  xxxg11xxx  and  xxxg15xxx 

cytes should also be examined to improve the estimation
of inhibition. stieger et al. have reported that the
cholestatic
estrogen-metabolite,
estradiol-17
bglucuronide, inhibits  xxxg11xxx  function in cmvs from
normal rat liver and  xxxg11xxx  w
 xxxg15xxx -coexpressing vesitrcles, but not in cmvs from  xxxg15xxx -deˆcient gy w
rats or vesicles expressing only  xxxg11xxx ,5) suggesting that
estradiol-17 b-glucuronide exhibits trans-inhibition of
 xxxg11xxx  after its secretion into bile canaliculi by  xxxg15xxx .
this type of inhibition should also be considered in
addition to cis-inhibition for a better understanding of
the detailed mechanism governing transporter inhibition.
in conclusion, here we have examined the inhibition
potential of a series of therapeutic drugs, producing
clinical cholestasis, on  xxxg11xxx  and  xxxg15xxx . although
most of the drugs have only a minimal inhibitory ešect
on rat  xxxg11xxx  and  xxxg15xxx , inhibition of  xxxg11xxx  at clinically relevant concentrations of cloxacillin as well as its
potent inhibition in human cmvs suggests the possible
involvement of  xxxg11xxx  inhibition in cholestasis. further
quantitative analysis assessing the inhibition of human
transporters is needed to clarify the importance of transporter inhibition in the cholestatic activity of other therapeutic compounds, including  xxxd1781xxx ,  xxxd2215xxx , and midecamycin.
