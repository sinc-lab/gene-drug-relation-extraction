5. expert opinion and conclusions

the antithrombotic management of venous thromboembolism (vte) has
gone through major developments. indirect inhibitors such as low molecular
weight heparin and the pentasaccharide fondaparinux represent improvements over traditional drugs such as unfractionated heparin for acute treatment of vte with more targeted approaches, predictable pharmacokinetic
profiles and lack of need for monitoring.  xxxd3522xxx  antagonists, with inherent limitations of multiple food and drug interactions and frequent need for
monitoring, remain the only oral anticoagulants approved for long-term secondary thromboprophylaxis in vte with the removal of the oral direct
thrombin inhibitor  xxxd3538xxx  from the world market due to safety concerns. newer anticoagulant drugs such as parenteral pentasaccharides (idraparinux and ssr-126517-e), oral direct thrombin inhibitors (dabigatran), oral
direct  xxxg741xxx  inhibitors (rivaroxaban, apixaban, ym-150 and du-176b) and
 xxxg748xxx –factor viia complex inhibitors (napc2) are tailor-made to target
specific procoagulant complexes and have the potential to greatly expand
our antithrombotic armamentarium for both acute and long-term treatment
of vte, especially as non-monitored parenteral and oral anticoagulants with
a wide therapeutic window and a predictable anticoagulant response.

1. introduction

the prevention and treatment of venous thromboembolism (vte) with antithrombotic drugs has undergone major recent developments. vte continues to be a
major cause of morbidity and mortality in the western world, with an incidence of
1 – 2 per 1000 people [1]. vte represents 1 in 10 hospital deaths and post-thrombotic syndrome and pulmonary hypertension occur in 10% of deep-vein thrombosis
(dvt) and 5% of pulmonary embolism (pe) patients, respectively [2]. for
> 60 years, traditional drugs such as unfractionated heparin were used parenterally
for acute treatment, followed by oral  xxxd3522xxx  antagonists (vkas) such as warfarin
for long-term treatment. these drugs exert their antithrombotic effects by
inhibiting multiple steps of the coagulation cascade, with inherent limitations for
each drug.
for acute vte treatment, limitations of unfractionated heparin include a
less-than-predictable anticoagulant response with the need for frequent monitoring,
a relatively narrow therapeutic window and the potential for severe toxicity,
especially heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (hit) in ≤ 3% of patients [3]. in the
past 15 years, the use of indirect inhibitors such as  xxxd1997xxx 
(lmwh) and recently the synthetically derived pentasaccharide fondaparinux has
improved our acute management of vte. a more targeted approach to

investigational treatments of venous thromboembolism

pharmacodynamic characteristics, and improved safety profiles have enabled complete out-patient treatment of vte in
selected patients with once- or twice-daily dosing and no need
for anticoagulant monitoring. other parenteral drugs, the
direct thrombin inhibitors (dtis)  xxxd2455xxx  and  xxxd218xxx ,
have found only limited use in acute vte treatment (namely
in thrombosis associated with hit) due to high
drug-acquisition costs and the need for frequent monitoring.
the optimal long-term treatment of vte is defined by the
limitations of vkas, the only oral anticoagulants that are
approved for use at present. these limitations include a slow
onset of action and the need for bridging anticoagulation with
a parenteral drug in the acute setting with genetic variations
in metabolism, multiple food and drug interactions, and a
narrow therapeutic window necessitating frequent coagulation monitoring and dose adjustment. although rare, toxicities with vkas exist (such as hypersensitivity reactions, and
purple-toe and blue-toe syndromes) that necessitate the discontinuation and the use of alternative anticoagulants for secondary thromboprophylaxis [4]. in addition, some patient
subgroups cannot tolerate vka, such as pregnant patients
who require anticoagulation, in whom vka is associated with
a risk of teratogenicity [5] or patients in whom vka is associated with higher risks of recurrent thromboembolism and
major bleeding, such as those with active cancer [6,7]. in both
of these patient groups, emerging data support the use of
long-term lmwh [8-10], with limitations of parenteral use.
improved understanding of molecular mechanisms of
coagulation and thrombosis, and its potential to be applied at
a clinical level to different patient subgroups has led to the
development of newer antithrombotic drugs for potential use
in vte treatment. many of these drugs are orally active,
synthetically derived and tailor-made to target specific
procoagulant complexes within the coagulation cascade
(figure 1) [11]. these drugs can broadly be categorized as
interfering with the initiation of coagulation (tissue
factor–factor viia [tf–fviia] complex inhibitors), propagation of coagulation (indirect and direct inhibitors of activated  xxxg741xxx  [ xxxg741xxx ] or ix [fixa]) and thrombin activity
(dtis). this review focuses on these investigational drugs for
vte treatment, with an emphasis on those undergoing or
that have recently completed phase ii or iii clinical studies.
data on primary thromboprophylaxis studies are also discussed as they pertain to agents that may be used for future
clinical trials in vte treatment.
2. tissue

factor–factor viia complex inhibitors

as part of the extrinsic system of the coagulation cascade, the
tf–fviia complex is considered to be the key system for the
initiation of coagulation. in the venous vascular system, it is
thought that exposure of tf in orthopedic surgery and in
subsets of cancer patients [12,13] may be responsible for the
high risk of vte in these patient groups, making
pharmacologic inhibition of the tf–fviia complex
432

important [14]. the function of tf can be blocked by antibodies that prevent the binding of fviia to tf, by active
site-inhibited fviia, by small molecules or antibodies that
block the tf–fviia complex function, and by molecules that
inhibit the active site of fviia in the tf–fviia complex after
first binding to  xxxg741xxx  [15,16]. moreover, tf pathway inhibitor
( xxxg2266xxx ), a naturally occurring inhibitor, forms a neutralizing
complex with tf–fviia and  xxxg741xxx  [14]. thus  xxxg2266xxx  may theoretically be an attractive anticoagulant either by upregulation
or exogenous administration of recombinant  xxxg2266xxx  (rtfpi).
2.1 nematode

anticoagulant proteins
nematode anticoagulant proteins (naps) are derived from
the nematode hookworm ancylostoma caninum and have been
targeted as antithrombotic drugs due to their inhibition of the
tf–fviia complex. this is achieved either through binding
to  xxxg741xxx  alone or (as in the case with napc2) in combination
with a protein exosite, resulting in potent inhibition of
tf–fviia. napc2 was tested subcutaneously for vte
prophylaxis in a phase i/ii clinical trial using mandatory unilateral venography in 293 patients undergoing total knee
replacement surgery. there were 5 regimens of napc2 that
were tested with a dosing scheme given on the day of surgery
(day 1), day 3, day 5 and an optional dose on day 7. napc2
3 µg/kg was administered within 1 h after surgery and associated with an overall dvt rate of 12.2%, a proximal dvt rate
of 1.3% and a major bleed rate of 2.3% [17]. further phase iii
studies are planned.
2.2 other

drugs
data exist on the anticoagulant effect of  xxxg2266xxx  in animals [18]
and the possibility that  xxxg2266xxx  release may have a role in secondary anticoagulant mechanisms of lmwh in humans [19].
rtfpi has only been used in experimental models so far.
3. inhibitors

of coagulation propagation

it is widely accepted that  xxxg741xxx  has a central role in clot formation as part of the  xxxg741xxx  complex with fva, given
that  xxxg741xxx  is generated by both the extrinsic and intrinsic pathways of coagulation as they converge into the final common
pathway. in addition one molecule of  xxxg741xxx  can exponentially
generate 138 molecules of thrombin per minute within the
 xxxg741xxx  complex. theoretically,  xxxg741xxx  inhibitors may
have advantages over thrombin inhibitors by preventing the
activation of coagulation amplification mechanisms as well as
thrombin generation in both platelet-rich arterial thrombosis
and fibrin-rich venous thrombosis, making  xxxg741xxx  a prime target
for anticoagulant drug design. however, selective  xxxg741xxx 
inhibition was less potent than direct thrombin inhibition in
arterial and venous models of thrombosis in animal models of
thrombosis, with a greater prolongation of global clotting
times; thus refuting the concept that  xxxg741xxx  is more effective
than direct thrombin activity in controlling thrombin
formation [20]. finally, the theoretical possibility exists that

selective inhibition of  xxxg741xxx  upstream may result in a safer
bleeding profile: in the absence of thrombin activity inhibition, small amounts of thrombin would escape neutralization
and facilitate hemostasis.
inhibitors of  xxxg741xxx  include both indirect (antithrombin
[at]-mediated) and direct (at-independent) selective inhibitors. other possible targets of coagulation propagation, via
the  xxxg741xxx  complex or other routes, include fixa
inhibitors, fviiia and fva inhibitors, and inhibitors of
 xxxg1847xxx  or soluble  xxxg2277xxx .
3.1 indirect

 xxxg741xxx  inhibitors
the synthetically derived pentasaccharides fondaparinux
and idraparinux represent the most developed selective indirect  xxxg741xxx  inhibitors. they exert their action by high-affinity
binding and activation of at, which subsequently inhibits
free  xxxg741xxx . fondaparinux has the pentasaccharide sequence
found in heparins and selectively binds to and induces a
conformational change in at, increasing the anti- xxxg741xxx 
activity of at ∼ 300-fold in a catalytic fashion.
fondaparinux has a linear pharmacokinetic profile and

predictable anticoagulant response with a plasma half-life of
∼ 18 h and > 95% bioavailability after intravenous or subcutaneous injection, allowing for non-monitored once-daily
subcutaneous dosing. in addition, it does not bind to  xxxg1726xxx  and has not been associated with drug-induced
thrombocytopenia. fondaparinux is approved for acute
treatment of dvt and pe, based on the recently completed
matisse studies in vte [21,22]. as such, fondaparinux represents the first drug of a class of selective indirect  xxxg741xxx 
inhibitors providing proof-of-concept that  xxxg741xxx  inhibitors
can treat thrombosis in the acute stage as effectively as drugs
with established at activity. fondaparinux also represents
the first of a new class of antithrombotic drug designed specifically to inhibit a single target or procoagulant complex in
the coagulation cascade.
3.1.1 idraparinux

idraparinux sodium is a second-generation pentasaccharide with
sulfated side chains resulting in a 30-fold higher binding affinity
to at compared with fondaparinux and a 120-h elimination
half-life, allowing for once-weekly administration [23]. it has

investigational treatments of venous thromboembolism

similar advantages to fondaparinux such as 100% bioavailability
after parenteral administration, linear pharmacokinetics, predictable anticoagulant response with no need for monitoring,
lack of induction of platelet aggregation, lack of  xxxg1726xxx 
effects and no evidence of induction of thrombocytopenia. as
with fondaparinux, the major drawback has been the lack of an
antidote, although its importance in clinical practice is controversial. however, it should be noted that biotinylated idraparinux (discussed in detail in section 3.1.2) has an antidote. in
the persist trial, a phase iia study of vte treatment, idraparinux was superior to warfarin in reducing symptomatic vte
and death without increased bleeding [24]. the large phase iii
van gogh treatment studies, comparing the efficacy and safety
of idraparinux with a heparin or fondaparinux and
dose-adjusted warfarin in both acute and long-term treatment of
dvt and pe, have recently been completed. preliminary results
revealed that the van gogh dvt study met non-inferiority criteria in reducing the risk of recurrent, objectively confirmed
symptomatic vte up until day 92 (2.9 versus 3.0%; odds ratio
[or]: 0.98; 95% ci: 0.63 – 1.50) but the van gogh pe study
did not meet the non-inferiority criterion (3.4 versus 1.6%;
or: 2.14; 95% ci: 1.21 – 3.78) [25]. explanations for the
differences between the studies are still a matter of debate. the
van gogh extension study revealed that idraparinux was more
effective than placebo (1.0 versus 3.7; p = 0.002) in the prevention of symptomatic vte during a 6-month extended
treatment period [26].
3.1.2 ssr-126517-e

(biotinylated idraparinux)
this synthetic pentasaccharide being developed by
sanofi-aventis has antithrombotic properties resulting from
at mediation of  xxxg741xxx  activity. it is identical to idraparinux
with the exception of a biotin moiety being covalently affixed
through a linker to the pentasaccharide structure so that
anti- xxxg741xxx  activity may be neutralized in vivo by a specific
protein (avidin). in vitro studies reveal that ssr-126517-e
(biotinylated idraparinux) shows high-affinity binding (dissociation rate constant [kd]: 10-9 m/l) to human at with a concentration-dependent inhibition of  xxxg741xxx . it does not
demonstrate direct thrombin inhibition and does not inhibit
platelet aggregation or cross-react with antibodies from sera of
patients with hit. in phase i studies, the median time to
reach the maximum concentration was 4 h with an absolute
bioavailability of 100% and a half-life of ∼ 200 h. exposure of
ssr-126517-e to avidin revealed a rapid decrease of anti- xxxg741xxx 
activity and no serious adverse events. by february 2006,
ssr-126517-e was in phase iib studies and is presently
undergoing phase iii studies for both acute and long-term
treatment of dvt and pe using lmwh and followed by
dose-adjusted warfarin as comparators.
3.1.3 other

pentasaccharides and oligosaccharides
other once-weekly pentasaccharides are under development at present. third-generation oligosaccharides with
additional thrombin-binding capacities are under
434

investigation, such as sr-123781 (the phase i clinical trial
is near completion).
3.2 selective

direct  xxxg741xxx  inhibitors
advantages of direct  xxxg741xxx  inhibitors include the absence of
intermediary molecules (such as at) that may potentially
result in inconsistent anticoagulation, especially during acute
or inflammatory states. dx-9065a was the first of a class of
small, synthesized, selective direct  xxxg741xxx  inhibitors to undergo
phase ii clinical trials in arterial thrombosis [27,28]. efforts to
produce orally available selective  xxxg741xxx  inhibitors for vte are
underway at present.
3.2.1 razaxaban

razaxaban (bms-561389), developed by bristol-myers
squibb (formerly dupont), represented the first of a new class
of synthetically derived, small-molecule oral direct  xxxg741xxx  inhibitors not requiring anticoagulant monitoring. it was well tolerated and well absorbed in phase i trials involving young and
elderly volunteers, with only nuisance bleeding reported. in
addition,  xxxg741xxx  inhibition and dose-dependent anticoagulation
were noted. razaxaban was studied as proof-of-principle for
dvt prevention in patients undergoing total knee replacement. in the phase iib trials, razaxaban 25, 50, 75 or 100 mg
b.i.d. initiated 8 h after surgery was compared with enoxaparin 30 mg b.i.d. initiated 12 – 24 h after surgery. the study
revealed efficacy but an unacceptable risk–benefit profile at
higher doses [29]. it was discontinued for further development
in march 2005 because another oral  xxxg741xxx  inhibitor (apixaban)
with a more favorable safety profile was under development
by the same company.
3.2.2 apixaban

apixaban (formerly  xxxd197xxx  or dpc-ag0023) is
another orally active, small-molecule direct  xxxg741xxx  inhibitor
being developed by bristol-myers squibb with a more favorable safety profile than razaxaban. it is a highly potent inhibitor of human  xxxg741xxx , with a ki of 0.08 ± 0.01 nm and 87%
is bound to serum proteins [30]. it has consistent oral absorption and linear pharmacokinetics with maximal plasma concentration (cmax) achieved within 3 h, and an effective
half-life of 9 h for twice-daily and 14 h for once-daily
administration [31]. it showed no interaction with cyp. its
elimination is via both hepatic and renal routes [31]. apixaban had only modest effects on two traditional markers of
anticoagulation, international normalized ratio (inr) and
activated partial thromboplastin time (aptt), with a third
experimental marker (the modified prothrombin time)
under investigation. phase i clinical studies revealed mild
bleeding and a prolongation of the bleeding time, without
evidence of high elevation of transaminases (alanine
transaminase or aspartate transaminase ≥ 5-times the upper
limit of normal). it is presently undergoing phase ii clinical
studies in elective total knee replacement surgery and acute
dvt treatment.

3.2.3 rivaroxaban

rivaroxaban (formerly  xxxd3134xxx ) is a small-molecule
selective oral direct  xxxg741xxx  inhibitor developed by bayer for the
prevention and treatment of thrombosis. preclinical studies
have shown a consistent and potent antithrombotic effect due
to its inhibition of  xxxg741xxx , but not due to inhibition of
thrombin or other proteins in the coagulation pathway or to
direct inhibition of platelet aggregation. in preclinical studies,
endogenously generated  xxxg741xxx  was inhibited with a ic50 value
of 1 nm [32]. the antithrombotic effect was demonstrated in
different thrombosis models with rivaroxaban 0.6 – 10 mg/kg
p.o., depending on models and species. the bioavailability
was 60 – 86% in dogs.
in phase i studies, rivaroxaban was rapidly absorbed (cmax
reached after 30 min) and well tolerated (≤ 80 mg after a
single dose in healthy people) [33]. elimination occurred with
terminal half-lifes of 4.86 – 9.15 h (steady state). prothrombin time, aptt and heptest were prolonged dose
dependently, and there was no influence on bleeding time. in
elderly men and women (> 60 years of age), mean auc and
cmax values tended to be ∼ 20% higher. there were no
drug–drug interactions or induction of major cyp isoforms,
with the exception of strong cyp3a4 inhibitors, and no qtc
prolongation was observed.
a total of four large dose-ranging studies (odixa-hip,
odixa-hip2, odixa-knee and odixa-od.hip) have
been completed, exploring a 12-fold rivaroxaban dose range
of 2.5 – 30 mg b.i.d. and 5 – 40 mg q.d. for vte prevention
in major orthopedic surgery [34-36]. the open-label phase iia
study odixa-hip using mandatory venography confirmed
proof-of-principle of rivaroxaban for this indication.
studies have confirmed the efficacy and safety of rivaroxaban compared with enoxaparin under double-blind, double-dummy conditions for vte prevention in patients
undergoing orthopedic surgery.
einstein-dvt is a phase iib multicenter, randomized,
double-blind, parallel-group, dose-finding study assessing the
dose–response relationship of a once-daily dose of rivaroxaban
20, 30 and 40 mg in the 12-week treatment of acute
symptomatic dvt. the comparator is unfractionated heparin
or lmwh followed by dose-adjusted warfarin (target
inr: 2.5). the odixa dvt study is another phase ii study
that compared mostly a twice-daily regimen of rivaroxaban
10, 20, 30 mg b.i.d. and 40 mg q.d. with dose-adjusted vka
for the same indication. preliminary results from both studies
revealed no significant dose–response relationship with rivaroxaban for the primary efficacy end point or major bleeding
in addition to no significant effects on liver enzymes [37,38]. a
large phase iii vte treatment program with rivaroxaban,
comprising the einstein vte treatment and extension
studies, is set to begin in 2007.
3.2.4 ym-150

astellas (formerly yamanouchi) has developed ym-150, an
oral selective  xxxg741xxx  inhibitor for dvt prevention. the

compound reveals an immediate antithrombotic effect after
oral administration, with a dose-dependent response and
prolongation of prothrombin time. there was also no significant food interaction noted. in a phase ii dose-escalation
study in patients undergoing elective primary hip replacement surgery, ym-150 3, 10, 30 or 60 mg q.d. p.o. administered 6 – 10 h after surgery for 7 – 10 days was compared
with enoxaparin 40 mg q.d. s.c. administered 12 h before
surgery [39]. there were no major bleeds. the median incidence of vte ranged from 52% with enoxaparin 3 mg to
19% with enoxaparin 60 mg. overall, the drug seemed to be
safe and well tolerated.
3.2.5 du-176b

daiichi sankyo is developing du-176b, an oral  xxxg741xxx  inhibitor
for the potential treatment of thrombotic disorders. preclinical data in mice models revealed potent antithrombotic
effects in both at-positive and at-deficient mice [40]. in rat
models, du-176b 0.05 – 1.25 mg/kg/h resulted in prevention of both arterial and venous thromboses. the compound also stimulated a three- to fourfold increase in  xxxg2266xxx  in
human vascular endothelial cells. in january 2005, phase ii
studies were started in the us and eu.
3.2.6 ly-517717

ly-517717, an indol-6-yl-carbonyl derivative, is the lead in a
series of oral selective  xxxg741xxx  inhibitors being developed by
eli lilly as part of a research collaboration with protherics for
the potential treatment of thromboembolic diseases. it is a
1000-fold more selective  xxxg741xxx  inhibitor than other serine
proteases, with a ki of 5 nm. its oral bioavailability is
∼ 25 – 82%, with a plasma half-life of 7 – 10 h. in a rat atrioventricular shunt model, the compound had a median effective dose of 5 – 10 mg/kg p.o. and absorption in dogs suggests
no bleeding issues. in a phase i study, ly-517717 was found
to be well tolerated and suitable for once-daily administration.
a phase ii study for dvt prevention in patients undergoing orthopedic surgery was presented in december 2005.
in this dose-escalating study, 511 patients undergoing hip or
knee replacement surgery were randomized to receive 1 of
6 oral doses of ly-517717 (25, 50, 75, 100, 125 or 150 mg)
or enoxaparin 40 mg/day s.c., started preoperatively for
6 – 10 doses. ly-517717 100, 125 and 150 mg were found to
be non-inferior to enoxaparin in the incidence of symptomatic or venographically proven dvt or pe [41]. ly-517717
produced a dose-dependent prolongation of prothrombin
time and was well tolerated, with no differences in bleeding
risk compared with enoxaparin. the half-life was ∼ 25 h.
further research is pending.
3.3 selective,

direct factor ixa inhibitors
although developments of direct fixa inhibitors are in an
earlier phase than direct  xxxg741xxx  inhibitors, the theoretical
advantages should be similar. ttp-889 (manufactured by
trans tech pharma) is an oral, direct factor ixa inhibitor

with a half-life of 20 h, enabling once-daily dosing. fixit is a
phase ii proof-of-principle study for vte prevention in hip
fracture surgery, which recently completed enrollment of
206 patients who received standard in-hospital thromboprophylaxis. efficacy and safety are compared between
patients who are randomized to receive ttp-889 versus
placebo for ≤ 3 weeks post-discharge [42].

4. inhibitors

of thrombin activity

thrombin is the central  xxxg745xxx  in hemostasis with
mechanisms of action affecting coagulation, platelet activation, fibrinolysis and vascular cell biology. in addition to its
major role in fibrin formation and activation of fxiii, which
cross-links fibrin, it is essential for feedback activation of
other coagulation factors such as fv,  xxxg751xxx  and fix [43].
thrombin also has a role in platelet activation and subsequent
aggregation [43]. lastly, thrombin acts as an anticoagulant (by
binding to  xxxg2277xxx , which converts protein c to its
active form, inactivating fva and fviiia) and has a regulatory
role in coagulation by downregulating fibrinolysis when
 xxxg2277xxx -bound thrombin activates  xxxg503xxx . the theoretical considerations
that thrombin inhibitors may be more effective than  xxxg741xxx 
inhibitors in arterial thromboembolic disease (in which
thrombin has a key role in platelet activation) and less effective in vte have not been borne out by clinical data. given
its central role in the coagulation cascade, inhibitors of
thrombin activity – whether mediated by at or acting
directly on the active site – represent an important class of
anticoagulant drug in our armamentarium.
4.1 indirect

thrombin inhibitors

4.1.1 snac/heparin

snac (sodium n-[8(2-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]caprylate,
developed by emisphere technologies) enabled macromolecule delivery of the large negatively charged and poorly
absorbed heparin molecule via a noncovalent complex with
heparin, which allowed passive, transcellular absorption.
snac itself has no pharmacologic activity. phase i studies
revealed that snac was well tolerated and nausea was the
only significant adverse event observed with snac
≤ 10.5 g/heparin 150,000 u. there were dose-dependent
increases in aptt and anti- xxxg741xxx  levels, suggesting that both
at-mediated thrombin and  xxxg741xxx  inhibition have a role in its
anticoagulant effects [44]. there was an apparent food and
diurnal effect observed, but no age effect. the protect
study was a large phase iii study in 2264 hip replacement
patients with 2 treatment arms of snac (low- and high-dose
snac) for 30 days versus 10 days of enoxaparin 30 mg s.c.
every 12 h [45]. mandatory venography on days 27 – 30
revealed an overall vte rate of 31.8% in the low-dose snac
group, 29.7% in the high-dose snac group and 26.1% in
the enoxaparin group. the rates of proximal dvt/pe were
18.6% in the low-dose snac group and 13.8% in the
436

high-dose snac group, both of which were significantly
higher than in the enoxaparin group (12.7%; p = 0.013 and
p = 0.045, respectively). there was overall poor compliance in
22.1% of the patients on the low-dose snac regimen and in
31.4% of the patients on the high-dose snac regimen, suggesting that substance compliance may be the key factor as to
why the phase iii study with snac/heparin did not attain
proof-of-principle for its use in vte prevention as an indirect
fiia/xa inhibitor.
4.2 direct

thrombin inhibitors
the development of dtis was driven by three major factors:
the increasing recognition of immune thrombocytopenia as a
potentially severe complication of heparin use [46]; the notion
that heparin–at inhibition of thrombin produces only weak
inhibition of cell surface- or clot-bound thrombin, and that
this bound thrombin is active and can be released during
fibrinolysis [47]; and the non-specific binding properties of
heparin that necessitate frequent monitoring. hence,
non-at-based thrombin inhibitors that have an improved
safety profile over heparin, the ability to inhibit surface- or
clot-bound thrombin and predictable dose–responses may
have clinical advantages. oral formulations of these drugs
would also represent a major advantage. dtis may also be
ideal drugs for hit treatment due to the generation of large
amounts of thrombin associated with this condition. lastly, a
theoretical concern of dtis was the inhibition of the
anticoagulant properties of thrombin, namely inhibition of
the thrombin– xxxg2277xxx -mediated-negative feedback
mechanism of the protein c system, with the possibility of
rebound hypercoagulability [48].
there are four parenteral dtis that have emerged:
 xxxd2455xxx ,  xxxd348xxx ,  xxxd218xxx  and melagatran, with the
first three having been approved for clinical use.  xxxd2455xxx  is
a naturally occurring bivalent dti that is approved in
patients with hit associated with thromboembolic complications.  xxxd218xxx  is the prototype noncovalent, reversible, small-molecule dti indicated for thromboprophylaxis
or treatment of hit. melagatran is the active form of the
oral, prodrug, small-molecule dti  xxxd3538xxx  (see
section 4.3.1). all of these drugs have limitations in terms of
parenteral use, limited indications, need for frequent
monitoring and high cost.
4.3 selective

oral direct thrombin inhibitors

4.3.1  xxxd3538xxx 

 xxxd3538xxx  (developed by astrazeneca) represented the first
of a new class of orally active, small-molecule dtis to reach
late-stage development and limited clinical indications for
vte prevention.  xxxd3538xxx  is the hydrophilic prodrug
converted by a cyp-independent liver enzyme system to its
active form melagatran, with ∼ 20% bioavailability and a
half-life of 4 – 5 h in patients. it was administered twice daily
and did not require anticoagulant monitoring or dose
adjustment.  xxxd3538xxx  was studied extensively in a large

phase iii program for vte prevention and treatment and was
found to be either superior or equivalent to warfarin in terms
of efficacy [49-54]. however, overall initial long-term data with
 xxxd3538xxx  revealed liver enzyme elevations of ∼ 6% and,
based on this and other considerations, the fda did not
approve its application. however, it was approved in other
countries for short-term post-orthopedic thromboprophylaxis. in february 2006, astrazeneca withdrew  xxxd3538xxx  from the world market due to continuing concerns of
severe liver toxicity with long-term use.

thrombosis. a controlled-release formulation of tgn-167 is
also being developed with eurand for long-term treatment of
thrombosis. the compound produces a marked increase in
thrombin clotting time, with minimal effects on aptt. a
double-blind, phase i, dose-escalation study with 20 volunteers showed the drug to be well tolerated, with no significant
adverse events reported [57]. all of the subjects dosed with
tgn-167 600 mg achieved in vitro effective anticoagulant
activity. trigen is planning to continue tgn-167 into
phase ii studies.

4.3.2 dabigatran

5. expert

dabigatran etexilate is another small-molecule, orally active,
prodrug dti developed by boehringer ingelheim that has
reached late-stage clinical development. it is rapidly absorbed
and converted to the active form dabigatran, with a limited
oral bioavailability of 4 – 5% [31]. it has linear characteristics
between concentration and global coagulation parameters,
including thrombin clotting time, inr and ecarin clotting
time. dabigatran has a ki of 4.5 ± 0.2 nm/l, a peak plasma
concentration at 2 h post-dose and a half-life of ∼ 14 – 17 h
after multiple dose administration [55]. it is mainly
(80 – 85%) metabolized via renal excretion.
the bistro ii study was a multicenter, parallel-group,
double-blind, dose-finding study for vte prevention in
1949 patients undergoing total hip or knee replacement [56].
patients were randomized to receive dabigatran 50, 150 or
225 mg b.i.d. or 300 mg q.d. initiated 1 – 4 h after surgery.
the comparator was enoxaparin 40 mg q.d. initiated 12 h
prior to surgery. a significant dose-dependent decrease in
dvt occurred with increasing doses of dabigatran
(p > 0.001); dvt was significantly lower in patients receiving
dabigatran 150 mg b.i.d. (or: 0.47; p = 0.0007), 300 mg
q.d. (or: 0.61; p = 0.02) and 225 mg b.i.d. (or: 0.47;
p = 0.0007) compared with enoxaparin. major bleeding was
lower with dabigatran 50 mg b.i.d. (0.3 versus 2.0%;
p = 0.047) compared with enoxaparin, but elevated at higher
doses, with trends almost reaching statistical significance in
those receiving the dabigatran 300 mg (4.7%; p = 0.051). in
terms of adverse events, the incidence of elevated alanine
aminotransferase > 3 × the upper limit of normal was lower in
the dabigatran groups (1.5 – 3.1%) than in the enoxaparin
group (7.4%). there were no cases of clinically relevant
thrombocytopenia. the authors concluded that dabigatran
started in the early postoperative period was effective and safe
across a wide range of doses. in addition, the frequency and
extent of severe hepatic abnormalities in this study are lower
than those observed with  xxxd3538xxx . at present, dabigatran
is undergoing extensive phase iii evaluation in vte prevention, treatment and secondary thromboprophylaxis with
its re-volution program.
4.3.3 tgn-167

tgn-167 (tri-50c-04) is an oral thrombin inhibitor being
developed by trigen holdings for the potential treatment of

opinion and conclusions

the antithrombotic management of vte will undergo significant changes in the next 5 – 10 years. the limitations of
existing parenteral and oral anticoagulants have led to the
development of newer agents designed to target specific procoagulant complexes in the coagulation pathway inhibiting
coagulation initiation, coagulation propagation or thrombin
activity. during acute treatment of vte, with respect to efficacy, newer antithrombotic agents must exhibit at least
non-inferiority in a methodologically sound design with
respect to the existing parenteral agent of choice (lmwh)
and the newer emerging agent fondaparinux. this is especially
true in high-risk venous thromboses such as ileofemoral vte,
pe or vte associated with cancer. for long-term vte treatment, there is a need to improve on the existing oral anticoagulants: the vkas. the target-selective oral agents must
exhibit an improved safety profile (especially as pertains to
major or clinically significant bleeding), ease-of-use and tolerability when compared with the vkas. if successful, these
emerging oral anticoagulant drugs have the potential to
negate the traditional distinction of acute versus long-term
treatment of vte as they may be used throughout the
spectrum of disease, without the need for overlap with
parenteral therapies [58]. in addition, any new long-term anticoagulant must be safely tolerated in combination with
antiplatelet agents as an aging population will increasingly be
prone to arterial as well as venous thromboembolic disease.
lastly, whether small-molecule agents (such as dtis and others) have the potential to exert non-anticoagulant effects, such
as those seen with heparin-based agents (i.e., antitumor,
anti-inflammatory and immunoregulatory effects) and that
may confer clinical advantages, remains to bee seen [31]. cost
considerations are also important, especially from a
populational perspective.
all of these newer agents should theoretically fulfill the
requirements of an ideal anticoagulant: a rapid onset with
predictable response characteristics, predictable pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics with low plasma protein
binding, lack of need for monitoring, a half-life that provides both safety and ease-of-use (especially during temporary withdrawal), lack of food or drug interactions, an
excellent safety profile (especially with respect to
immune-mediated thrombocytopenia, hepatotoxicity and

potential for thrombotic rebound phenomenon) and reversibility or availability of an antidote. in addition, oral agents
with predictable intestinal absorption/bioavailability used in
a simple, fixed-dose once- or twice-daily regimen and with
the ability to have compliance monitored would present
further advantages.
at this time, drugs at the most advanced stage of development with respect to vte management include the
parenteral indirect  xxxg741xxx  inhibitor idraparinux and biotinylated
idraparinux, the oral dti dabigatran and the oral selective
direct  xxxg741xxx  inhibitors such as rivaroxaban and apixaban.
whether there are inherent advantages in blocking initial
thrombin formation via the  xxxg741xxx  complex early in
the coagulation system or blocking thrombin directly and preventing feedback amplification is still a matter of debate, as is
the notion of whether there is any clinically meaningful effect
of small-molecule dtis that target both clot-bound and free
thrombin. long-term clinical data with respect to efficacy of
direct  xxxg741xxx  inhibitors will be available shortly, whereas

long-term data are available on the efficacy of direct thrombin
inhibition. whether the absence of a dose–response relationship (as seen for direct  xxxg741xxx  inhibitors such as rivaroxaban) has
potential advantages or disadvantages at a clinical level
remains to be seen. the lessons from  xxxd3538xxx  reveal the
importance of long-term safety data and a better biochemical
understanding of the role of procoagulant complexes – especially thrombin – in a possible rebound thrombotic phenomenon during cessation of therapy as thrombin also has
important anticoagulant and fibrinolytic regulatory effects.
a new era of antithrombotic therapies for vte
management may manifest in the not-too-distant future.
