abstract
 xxxd107xxx , a humanized mab undergoing clinical trials for treatment of leukemia,
transplantation and autoimmune diseases, produces substantial lymphocyte depletion in vivo.
the antibody binds to  xxxg393xxx , a highly glycosylated molecule attached to the membrane by a
glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor. cross-linked  xxxd107xxx  is known to activate t cells in vitro.
we have investigated the molecular basis for these effects by comparing the protein tyrosine
phosphorylation signals induced by  xxxd107xxx  and the cd3 mab  xxxd2676xxx  in primary t cells, and in
cd45⍣tcr⍣, cd45–tcr⍣ and cd45⍣tcr– jurkat subclones transfected with  xxxg393xxx . our results
show that  xxxd107xxx  triggers similar tyrosine phosphorylation events as  xxxd2676xxx  in both primary t
cells and in the cd45⍣tcr⍣ jurkat sub-clone, albeit at quantitatively lower levels. however, no
phospholipase cgamma1 activation nor calcium signals were detected in response to  xxxg393xxx  ligation. the
 xxxg393xxx -mediated induction of protein tyrosine phosphorylation was absolutely dependent upon the
expression of both the tcr and the cd45  xxxg401xxx  at the cell surface.
cross-linking of  xxxd107xxx  was essential for signal transduction in all cells investigated.
fluorescence resonance energy transfer was used to demonstrate  xxxg393xxx  homo-association at the
cell surface in jurkat t cells in a tcr- and cd45-independent manner, and  xxxg393xxx –tcr association
in cd45⍣tcr⍣ cells. we propose a model to explain the activating effects of  xxxd107xxx  in which
 xxxg393xxx  mab cross-linking causes the trapping of tcr polypeptides within molecular complexes
at the cell surface, thereby inducing signals via the tcr by a process which depends on the
cd45-mediated regulation of the  xxxg1306xxx  and p59fyn tyrosine kinases.
introduction
t cell activation not only requires the engagement of the tcr,
but also the participation of additional co-stimulatory receptors
to induce optimal t cell proliferation (1). several lymphocyte
antigens with a diverse range of extracellular domains, but
attached to the membrane with a glycosylphosphatidylinositol
(gpi) anchor, have also been shown to transduce signals
resulting in proliferation, il-2 production and ca2⫹ mobilization. these proteins include thy-1 (2), qa-2 (3), ly-6 (4),
human decay-accelerating factor ( xxxg394xxx ) (5), cd59 (6) and
 xxxg1612xxx  (7). antibodies to these molecules are mitogenic in vitro
and may mimic the interaction of the natural ligand(s) in vivo.

 xxxd107xxx , a humanized antibody (8,9), is directed at
 xxxg393xxx , a small heavily glycosylated protein expressed at
high levels (5⫻105 molecules/cell) on human lymphocytes
and monocytes (10,11).  xxxg393xxx  is a very good target for
complement-mediated lysis and antibody-dependent cellular
cytotoxicity (12), and depletes t cells and b cells efficiently
in vivo.  xxxd107xxx  has been used in clinical trials, many
still in progress, to treat t and b cell malignancies, renal
transplant rejection, rheumatoid arthritis, systemic vasculitis,
and multiple sclerosis (13–17).
the structure of  xxxg393xxx  has been extensively studied (18–20).

506 cd45 regulates  xxxd107xxx  ( xxxg393xxx ) t cell signal transduction
the molecule has a mol. wt of 21–28 kda, as determined
by sds–page and immunoblotting. the mature protein
comprises a very short peptide of 12 amino acids with a single
n-linked oligosaccharide. the protein is attached to the
membrane via a gpi anchor (11) as determined by treatment
with phosphoinositol-specific phospholipase c (plc). the
function and natural ligand(s) (if any) of  xxxg393xxx  remain unknown.
it has previously been shown that the combination of crosslinked  xxxd107xxx  with phorbol  xxxd2681xxx  acetate (pma) is
mitogenic in vitro (21), causing proliferation and cytokine
production in resting cd4⫹ and cd8⫹ t cells. to understand
the molecular basis for these effects we have studied
intracellular signalling mediated by  xxxg393xxx  with particular
reference to the regulatory role of the cd45 transmembrane
 xxxg401xxx  (22). the reasons for focusing
on the role of cd45 are as follows: the physiological substrates
for cd45 which have been identified so far are the src-family
protein tyrosine kinases p59fyn and  xxxg1306xxx  that associate with
the tcr and cd4/8 antigens respectively (23–26). interestingly, these kinases have also been found to co-precipitate
with gpi-linked molecules (27–29). furthermore, an intact
tcr appears to be required for signalling through gpi-linked
molecules (23,24). since it is clear that cd45 controls the
ability of the tcr to couple to intracellular signals by regulating
the actions of  xxxg1306xxx  and p59fyn (22), it is possible that cd45
also regulates signalling through gpi-linked molecules. in
fact, it has been reported that in the absence of cd45, t cell
clones do not signal in response to antibodies to the gpilinked molecule thy-1 (25), and thy-1 and cd45 have been
reported to co-precipitate after chemical cross-linking (26).
in order to gain insight into the molecular mechanisms of
 xxxg393xxx  signal transduction, we have studied early events such
as protein tyrosine phosphorylation and calcium signalling.
using purified human primary t cells and mutant jurkat subclones lacking either cd45 or tcr expression, we show
that cd3 and  xxxd107xxx  mab induce protein tyrosine
phosphorylation in a similar array of substrates, including
tcr zeta, and that the expression of both cd45 and the tcr
are essential for coupling  xxxg393xxx  to intracellular signals. an
intimate relationship between  xxxg393xxx  and the tcr is supported
by our observation that  xxxg393xxx  associates with the tcr on the
surface of intact cells. surprisingly, however,  xxxd107xxx 
failed to induce detectable calcium signals in either primary
t cells or in jurkat cells, suggesting that  xxxg393xxx -mediated
signals are not identical to those triggered by cd3 mab. we
discuss the ways in which  xxxg393xxx  mab such as  xxxd107xxx 
may utilize the molecular signalling machinery of the tcr to
induce activation signals in t cells.

 xxxg2438xxx  mab (signal transduction laboratories), goat antihuman f(ab)2 (gah) (icn, basingstoke, uk), and the following
mouse anti-human mab: anti-cd16 and anti-hla-dr (becton
dickinson, san jose, ca), anti- xxxg375xxx , anti- xxxg382xxx , anti-cd8
(serotec, oxford, uk), and anti-glycophorin (sigma). the gst–
grb-2 fusion protein was a kind gift of d. cantrell (london,
uk). f(ab⬘) fragments were prepared from mab as previously
described (27).
flow cytometric analysis
flow cytometry was performed by staining cells with primary
antibody in 50 µl pbs/10 mm nan3 on ice for 30 min. cells
were then incubated with either rabbit anti-mouse ig–fitc
(dako) or, in the case of  xxxd107xxx , with mouse antihuman–fitc (sigma). after washing samples, viable cells
were analysed (10,000 events) on a facscan flow cytometer
using cellquest software (becton dickinson).
cells
primary t cells were isolated from buffy coats obtained
from the national blood transfusion service (addenbrooke’s
hospital, cambridge, uk). peripheral blood mononuclear
cells (pbmc) were isolated by lymphoprep (nycomed, oslo,
norway) density gradient centrifugation from buffy coats
prepared from the blood of healthy donors. pbmc were
depleted of adherent cells by incubation in plastic tissue
culture flasks (nunclon; nunc, roskilde, denmark) for 60 min
at 37°c. t cells were then isolated from non-adherent cells
by immuno-magnetic negative selection. cells were resuspended at 107 cells/ml in hepes-modified rpmi 1640
supplemented with antibiotics (penicillin and streptomycin),
l-glutamine and 5% heat-inactivated fcs, and incubated for
20 min at 4°c with saturating concentrations of anti-cd16,
anti-hla-dr, anti- xxxg375xxx , anti- xxxg382xxx  and anti-glycophorin
mab. cells were washed twice, resuspended at 108 cells/ml
in medium, and incubated with sam igg-coupled dynabeads
(4⫻106 beads/107 cells) for 30 min at 4°c. the cells were
then resuspended in 1 ml medium, and incubated with a
dynal magnetic particle concentrator for 2 min in order to
remove monocytes, nk cells, b cells, dendritic cells and
erythrocytes. the supernatant containing non-magnetized
cells was removed, the cells were pelleted by centrifugation
and the selection process performed once more. cells were
routinely ⬎95% cd3⫹ as determined by flow cytometric
analysis.
jurkat sub-clones used were e6 (cd45⫹tcr⫹), j45.01
(cd45–tcr⫹) and 31-13 (cd45⫹tcr–, kindly provided by a.
alcover, paris). jurkat cells were cultured in rpmi 1640
supplemented with antibiotics, l-glutamine and 5% heatinactivated fcs. for electroporation with  xxxg393xxx  cdna, jurkat
cells were grown in 500 µl rpmi supplemented with 20 %
fcs and electroporated at 250v, 960 µf, using 20 ng of a
purified  xxxg393xxx -containing plasmid (kind gift of dr masahide

cd45 regulates  xxxd107xxx  ( xxxg393xxx ) t cell signal transduction 507
tone, university of oxford, uk). stable transfectants were
isolated using 1 mg/ml  xxxg418xxx  (sigma). clones appeared after
3 weeks and were selected according to their phenotype as
determined by facs analysis.
cell activation and immunoblotting
yth 360.10.1 and  xxxd107xxx  were used to ligate  xxxg393xxx  at
concentrations at 5–50 µg/ml with 2–10⫻106 cells in 100 µl.
the best signal:noise ratio was obtained using 2⫻106 cells
per assay and 5 µg/ml  xxxd107xxx  or 10 µg/ml yth 360.10.1.
the concentration of cross-linking antibody was kept
constant at 100 µg/ml. cells in 100 µl serum-free rpmi were
incubated with antibody for 1 min followed by addition of
cross-linking antibody for 5 min (unless otherwise stated),
washed in medium and then lysed in lysis buffer (1% np-40,
10 mm tris, ph 7.5, 150 mm nacl, 50 mm naf, 20 mm
na4p2o7, 1 mm na3vo4, 1 mm egta, 10 mm edta, 1 mm
 xxxd502xxx , and 2 µg/ml each of aprotinin and leupeptin) for
10 min on ice. post-nuclear lysates were either used for solidphase immunoprecipitation or directly subjected to sds–
page analysis. lysates from 5⫻107 and 108 jurkat cells were
used per assay for immunoprecipitating with fb2 and plcgamma1
mab respectively. proteins were transferred to immobilon-p,
and probed with 4g10 and gam–hrp. bands were visualised
using the ecl system (amersham pharmacia biotech, little
chalfont, uk) and autoradiography.
calcium assay
calcium assays were carried out as previously described
(28). briefly, 5⫻106 cells/ml were loaded for 30 min at 37°c
with 3 µm indo-1 (molecular probes) in rpmi/10 mm hepes
supplemented with 2% fcs and then washed 3 times in
hbss plus 0.2% fcs. the cells (105 cells/ml) were prewarmed for 2 min at 3°c and then stimulated with first antibody
(either  xxxd2676xxx  or  xxxd107xxx ) for 1 min, followed by crosslinking antibody sam or gah ig respectively. increases in
intracellular ca2⫹ were measured by a facstar plus using
cellquest software (becton dickinson).
inositol phosphate (insp) assay
insp analysis was carried out according to the method
of berridge et al. (29). briefly, cells were labelled over
night with 1 µci/ml myo-[3h]inositol (amersham pharmacia
biotech). cells (2⫻106) cells were incubated in a final volume
of 200 µl for 10 min with  xxxd2676xxx  (5 µg/ml),  xxxd107xxx 
(20 µg/ml) and then gah (100 µg/ml) or left untreated.
incubations were performed in triplicate. the reactions were
terminated by addition of 750 µl chloroform: methanol and
left on ice. then 200 µl chloroform and water were added
sequentially, mixed and spun for 1 min in a microfuge, and
800 µl of supernatant was removed and applied to a 750 µl
dowex column. after washing, total insp was eluted with
3 ml of 0.1 m  xxxd2154xxx /1 m ammonium formate and subjected to liquid scintillation counting.

-6)-carboxamido)-hexanoic acid succinimidyl ester (molecular
probes, eugene, or) as described (30). the use of a capital f
or r in front of the name of an antibody or f(ab⬘) fragment
designates fluoresceinated and rhodaminated antibodies
respectively. the dye:protein ratios varied between 2 and 4,
and were separately determined for each labeled aliquot by
spectrophotometric measurements. the fluorescently tagged
antibodies and f(ab⬘) fragments retained their binding
capacity according to competition assays with identical, but
unlabeled antibodies.
for labeling of cell surface antigens, cells were washed
twice and resuspended in pbs. about 106 cells in 50 µl of
pbs were incubated with fluorescently tagged antibodies
or f(ab⬘) fragments at saturating concentration for 30 min
on ice in the dark. the applied antibody concentration (100–
200 µg/ml) saturated all available binding sites and produced
at least partly monomeric binding of the antibodies that
reduced the possibility of cross-linking. the excess mab or
f(ab⬘) fragment was removed by washing the cells twice in
pbs. cells were either used immediately for measurements
or were fixed in 1% formaldehyde. results obtained with live
and fixed cells were similar. antibodies were centrifuged at
100,000 g for 30 min before use to avoid possible aggregation.
flow cytometric energy transfer measurements were
carried out using a modified becton dickinson facstar plus
flow cytometer to determine fret efficiency between f- and
r-conjugated mab and f(ab⬘) fragments on a cell-by-cell
basis. a detailed description of the method has been given
elsewhere (31,32). in brief, fluorescence was excited with the
488 and 514 nm lines of an argon ion laser, and fluorescence
emission was detected at 540 ⫾ 20 and ⬎580 nm for the
488 nm excitation, and ⬎580 nm for the 514 nm excitation.
correction factors for the spectral overlap between the fluorescent dyes were obtained from data measured on singlelabeled cells. forward angle light scattering (at 514 nm) was
used to gate out debris. the calculated energy transfer
efficiency (e) was expressed as the ratio of the number of
excited donor molecules tunnelling their excitation energy to
the acceptor and the number of all excited molecules. energy
transfer was calculated on a cell-by-cell basis on 10,000 cells
using list mode data. the transfer efficiency is related to the
inverse sixth power of the separation between the donor
and the acceptor when the orientation factor of the donor’s
excitation and the acceptor’s emission dipoles can be
considered as a statistical average of random orientations
(33). the calculated energy transfer efficiency has an
extremely high sensitivity to changes in distances within the
range 2–10 nm. larger energy transfer efficiency may reflect
closer physical association of the donor- and acceptor-labeled
antibodies or a larger density of acceptor-labeled antibodies
in the vicinity of donor-labeled antibodies.

 xxxg393xxx -induced signal transduction in primary human t cells

for labeling of antibodies and f(ab⬘) fragments with fluorescent
probes, purified aliquots of purified mab and f(ab⬘) fragments
were conjugated with 6-(fluorescein-5-carboxamido)-hexanoic
acid succinimidyl ester and 6-(tetramethylrhodamine-5-(and

in light of previous results implicating  xxxg1306xxx  and p59fyn in the
signals mediated by gpi-linked molecules, we expected that
 xxxg393xxx  mab also would induce increases in protein tyrosine
phosphorylation in t cells. this was demonstrated by prepar-

fig. 1.  xxxg393xxx -induced protein tyrosine phosphorylation in primary
human t cells (a) purified human t cells were incubated without (c)
or with  xxxg393xxx  mab (yth 360.10.1) for 2 min and anti-ig added for
the times indicated. lysates were prepared, separated by sds–
page and immunoblotted with  xxxd1075xxx  mab 4g10. the
migration of protein molecular mass standards are shown on the left.
(b) lysates of human t cells unstimulated (lane 1) or stimulated with
 xxxg393xxx  mab ( xxxd107xxx ) and anti-ig (lanes 2 and 3) were subjected
to solid-phase immunoprecipitation with  xxxd1075xxx  mab fb2,
followed by sds–page separation and immunoblotting with 4g10.
lanes 2 and 3 show the results using two separate t cell preparations.

ing highly purified t cells from pbmc and measuring changes
in tyrosine phosphorylation in whole cell lysates derived
from cells activated with the rat-anti-human  xxxg393xxx  mab yth
360.10.1 over a period of 1–120 min. as fig. 1(a) illustrates,
yth 360.10.1 triggered clearly detectable increases in
tyrosine phosphorylation within 1 min of cross-linking the mab
which were most prominent in proteins of mol. wt 62–70 and
90–120 kda. phosphorylation levels began to decline after
10 min of cross-linking. similar results (data not shown) were
obtained using the humanized  xxxd107xxx  mab, showing
that the humanization of the mab had not caused any obvious
changes in its activating potential when compared with the
rat mab. for both the rat and humanized  xxxg393xxx  mab, crosslinking using secondary antibodies was found to be essential
for the induction of detectable increases in tyrosine phosphorylation (data not shown). since some tyrosine phosphorylation
events may not be readily visible in whole cell lysates, we
precipitated tyrosine phosphorylated proteins from cd52activated cells using the specific fb2 mab followed by
immunoblotting with a  xxxd1075xxx  mab. figure 1(b)
shows that increases in tyrosine phosphorylation in additional
proteins of mol. wt 21 and 36 kda could also be clearly
detected using this approach, besides those noted in whole
cell lysates (cf. fig 1a). a small degree of variation was noted
in the signals between t cell preparations from different blood
donors, e.g. the proteins at ~45 kda in lane 2 or 140 kda in
lane 3 of fig. 1(b) could not be observed in all t cell
batches tested.

fig. 2.  xxxd107xxx  and  xxxd2676xxx  induce tyrosine phosphorylation in
similar proteins in human primary t cells. (a) lysates of human
t cells unstimulated (lane 1) or stimulated with cross-linked
 xxxd107xxx  (lane 2) or  xxxd2676xxx  (lane 3) were separated by sds–page
and then immunoblotted with 4g10. (b) lysates of human t cells
unstimulated (lane 1) or stimulated with cross-linked  xxxd107xxx 
(lane 2) or  xxxd2676xxx  (lane 3) were immunoprecipitated with ct11 tcr zeta
antiserum, separated by sds–page and immunoblotted with 4g10
(left-hand panel). the blot was then re-probed with a different tcr
zeta antibody (right-hand panel). (c) grb2-fusion protein precipitates of
human t cells unstimulated (lane 1) or stimulated with cross-linked
 xxxd107xxx  (lane 2) or  xxxd2676xxx  (lane 3) were separated by sds–page
and immunoblotted with 4g10

t cell activation through gpi-linked molecules is thought to
be dependent on the expression of a functional tcr (23,24).
in order to investigate whether  xxxg393xxx -mediated signalling is
related to tcr-induced tyrosine phosphorylation events, we
compared  xxxg393xxx -induced phosphorylation with that caused
by ligation of the tcr. figure 2(a) shows that cross-linked
 xxxd107xxx  (fig. 2a, lane 2) and cross-linked cd3 mab
 xxxd2676xxx  (fig. 2a, lane 3) induced increases in tyrosine phosphorylation in an apparently similar array of proteins. however,
in this as in other experiments, the phosphorylation signals
induced by  xxxd107xxx  were significantly lower than those
triggered upon tcr ligation.
many of the proteins which become tyrosine phosphorylated
upon tcr ligation have been previously identified, and include
the  xxxg379xxx , the  xxxg2438xxx   xxxg2198xxx , the protooncogenes p95vav and p120cbl, and the adaptor proteins
slp-76 and pp 36 (lat) (34,35). it is thought that the

cd45 regulates  xxxd107xxx  ( xxxg393xxx ) t cell signal transduction 509
phosphorylation of tcr zeta, by a process requiring cd45activated  xxxg1306xxx  (28,36), plays a key role in initiating a
signalling cascade which couples the tcr to intracellular
signals. figure 2(b, left panel) shows that both  xxxd107xxx 
(fig. 2b, lane 2) and  xxxd2676xxx  (fig. 2b, lane 3) triggered
increases in the p21 tcr zeta phosphoisomer, although the
level of phosphorylation induced by  xxxd107xxx  was much
lower than that induced by  xxxd2676xxx , despite the presence
of comparable amounts of the non-phosphorylated tcr zeta
polypeptide in the immunoprecipitates (cf. fig. 2b, right
panel). immunoblotting with a zeta chain-specific antibody also
revealed that the amount of zeta chain polypeptide phosphorylated by  xxxd2676xxx  was small in relation to the total tcr zeta
precipitated (cf. the small zeta-p signal at 21 kda with the
major zeta-0 signal at 16 kda) and in fact was non-detectable
upon  xxxg393xxx  ligation. these results confirm that the 21 kda
tyrosine phosphorylated protein illustrated in figs 1(b) and
2(a) was tcr zeta.
the adaptor protein grb-2 is known to bind to multimeric
molecular complexes in t cells containing proteins which
become tyrosine phosphorylated upon tcr ligation. these
include p120cbl, p95vav, slp-76 and lat (37,38). to investigate
the tyrosine phosphorylation of these proteins in response to
 xxxd107xxx , immobilized grb-2 fusion protein precipitates
from activated cells were immunoblotted with  xxxd1075xxx 
mab. figure 2(c) shows that the profile of phosphorylated
proteins appeared very similar irrespective of whether the
cells were activated with  xxxd107xxx  (fig. 2c, lane 2) or
 xxxd2676xxx  (fig. 2c, lane 3). there was a marked increase in
phosphorylation in both cases in the pp36 protein recently
cloned and re-named lat (37), as well as in proteins provisionally identified by their electrophoretic mobility as slp-76,
p95vav and p120cbl. taken together these results suggest that
 xxxg393xxx  ligation induces increases in tyrosine phosphorylation
in many or even all of the same proteins which become
phosphorylated upon tcr stimulation, suggesting that  xxxg393xxx 
may utilize the molecular signalling machinery of the tcr to
stimulate intracellular signalling pathways.
the role of cd45 and the tcr in  xxxg393xxx -mediated signalling
to obtain a fuller understanding of the role of the tcr in
 xxxg393xxx -mediated signal transduction and, in particular, to
elucidate the possible role of cd45 in this process, we used
the jurkat e6 (cd45⫹tcr⫹, a12), j45.01 (cd45–tcr⫹, b8)
and 31-13 (cd45⫹tcr–, c2) sub-clones. initial analysis
revealed that  xxxg393xxx  expression on jurkat cells was ~10-fold
less than its expression on primary t cells (data not shown).
therefore we transfected each sub-clone with  xxxg393xxx  cdna
and selected stable transfectants expressing  xxxg393xxx  at levels
comparable with those found in primary human t cells, as
illustrated in fig. 3. the low cd45 expression detected on
the j45.01 sub-clone (b8) was similar to that earlier described
for these cells, a level insufficient to promote tcr-mediated
signals (38). the expression of  xxxg1306xxx  and p59fyn in the
selected transfectants was similar, as established by immunoblotting, although the cd45⫹tcr– c2 sub-clone expressed
approximately twice as much p59fyn as the a12 and b8 subclones (data not shown).
in the a12 cd45⫹ jurkat sub-clone, both  xxxd107xxx  and
 xxxd2676xxx  (fig. 4a, lanes 2 and 3) induced a similar profile of

protein tyrosine phosphorylation as in primary t cells, although
as with primary t cells the phosphorylation signals induced
by  xxxg393xxx  mab were lower than those triggered by  xxxd2676xxx . it
should also be noted that jurkat cells were stimulated with
 xxxd2676xxx  without further addition of a cross-linking reagent,
whereas increases in tyrosine phosphorylation in response to
 xxxg393xxx  stimulation were only observed following cross-linking
of  xxxg393xxx  mab (data not shown). furthermore, the induction
of  xxxg379xxx  phosphorylation was weak in jurkat cells in
response to  xxxd2676xxx  and was not detectable upon  xxxg393xxx 
ligation. interestingly, in the b8 and c2 sub-clones no
 xxxd107xxx - or  xxxd2676xxx -induced tyrosine phosphorylation
was observed (fig. 4a, lanes 5 and 6, and data not
shown), showing that  xxxg393xxx  signal transduction is dependent
upon cd45 and tcr expression. in addition, cd45– cells
had less background protein phosphorylation than cd45⫹
cells (fig. 4a, cf. lanes 1 and 4).
 xxxg393xxx  signal transduction was further characterized in the
jurkat sub-clones by precipitating tyrosine phosphorylated
proteins using the fb2 mab and then identifying the
proteins by immunoblotting. figure 4(b) shows that ligation
of  xxxd107xxx  induced increased tyrosine phosphorylation
of  xxxg2438xxx , vav and lat. the induction of lat phosphorylation was confirmed by precipitating lat with the immobilized
grb-2 fusion protein followed by immunoblotting with
 xxxd1075xxx  mab (data not shown). in contrast, no
increase in phosphorylation of plcgamma1 was detectable,
although a clear plcgamma1 phosphorylation signal was observed
in response to  xxxd2676xxx .
 xxxd107xxx  fails to trigger ca2⫹ or insp in human t cells
mobilization of intracellular ca2⫹ is an important event
preceding cell proliferation in response to tcr ligation. as
cross-linked  xxxd107xxx  plus pma induces proliferation of
human t cells in vitro (21), we investigated ca2⫹ signalling
in primary t cells and in the  xxxg393xxx -transfected jurkat subclones. whereas cross-linked  xxxd2676xxx  triggered a transient
ca2⫹ signal in primary t cells, in which ~50% of the cells
responded, cross-linked  xxxd107xxx  failed to do so (fig. 5).
similarly, in the cd45⫹tcr⫹ a12 jurkat sub-clone, as also
illustrated in fig. 5, no detectable calcium signal was induced
in response to the cross-linking of  xxxd107xxx , although the
 xxxd2676xxx -stimulated calcium signal was readily detectable. as
expected, no  xxxd2676xxx  or  xxxd107xxx  stimulated calcium signals
were detectable in the b8 or c2 sub-clones (data not shown).
cross-linked  xxxd107xxx  was tested at mab concentrations
in the range 1–100 µg/ml, but in no case was a calcium signal
detected in either primary t cells or jurkat cells (data not
shown). since the assays illustrated in figures were carried
out over short periods of only 6 min, we considered that
 xxxd107xxx  might be inducing a much slower and more
gradual rise in intracellular ca2⫹. however, monitoring of cells
over a 30 min period following  xxxg393xxx  ligation did not lead to
any detectable changes in calcium levels (data not shown).
we also considered that  xxxd107xxx  might be inducing a
negative signal which counteracted its possible ability to
mobilise intracellular calcium. to test this hypothesis a12
cells were preincubated with cross-linked  xxxd107xxx  and
then stimulated with  xxxd2676xxx  to determine whether the okt3triggered ca2⫹ signal would be reduced. however, no inhibi-

tion of the cd3-stimulated calcium signal was observed (data
not shown).
the failure of  xxxd107xxx  to induce a calcium signal is
consistent with the lack of inducible plcgamma1 tyrosine phosphorylation following  xxxg393xxx  cross-linking (fig. 4b). to assess
whether  xxxd107xxx  could stimulate activation of plcgamma1, we
measured insp production in the a12 cd45⫹ jurkat subclone in response to either tcr or  xxxg393xxx  ligation. as table 1
illustrates, a 2- to 3-fold increase in insp was generated in
response to cd3 ligation, as expected, but no detectable
insp production was observed in response to cross-linked
 xxxd107xxx .
in summary, therefore,  xxxg393xxx  ligation induces a profile of
tyrosine phosphorylated proteins which appears qualitatively
similar but quantitatively lower to that induced upon tcr
ligation in both primary and jurkat t cells, and these signalling
events are dependent upon both cd45 and tcr expression.
however,  xxxg393xxx  signal transduction is not identical to the
signals triggered by a cd3 mab because neither plcgamma1
activation nor calcium signals were detected in response to
 xxxg393xxx  ligation in contrast to the large plcgamma1 activation and
calcium signals measured in response to tcr ligation.

 xxxg393xxx –tcr and  xxxg393xxx – xxxg393xxx  association at the t cell surface
to investigate further the possible relationship between  xxxg393xxx 
and the tcr at the t cell surface, we employed the fret
technique to measure possible associations of  xxxg393xxx  with the
tcr and other cell surface receptors. fret analysis has the
advantage that it avoids the use of detergent and enables
interactions to be detected on intact cells when molecules
are juxtaposed within distances of 10 nm or less. in the
present work fluorescein (f) and rhodamine (r) were used
as the fluorescent probes, and the relevant mab were
directly conjugated to one or other of the probes. r- xxxg393xxx 
and f- xxxg393xxx  were used to study  xxxg393xxx  homo-association.
previous experience using this technique suggests that
energy transfer values of ⬎10% indicate that a significant
degree of association is taking place (27,30). figure 6(a)
shows that substantial energy transfer occurred between
 xxxg393xxx  molecules on the surface of the cd52hi-transfected
jurkat t cells, demonstrating homo-association of  xxxg393xxx . this
homo-association was independent of the expression of cd45
or the tcr, because similar levels of energy transfer between
r- xxxg393xxx  and f- xxxg393xxx  were found on all three jurkat subclones (table 2). the homo-association was not the result of

cd45 regulates  xxxd107xxx  ( xxxg393xxx ) t cell signal transduction 511
association were observed in the three jurkat sub-clones
investigated (table 2), so confirming the selectivity of the
cd3– xxxg393xxx  and  xxxg393xxx – xxxg393xxx  associations. a low degree
of association was, however, detected between the tcr
and cd45.
we considered that if significant cd3– xxxg393xxx  association
was occurring on the surface of tcr⫹cd45⫹ cells, then
unlabeled  xxxd107xxx  might perturb the binding of f-cd3
mab to the tcr. figure 6(b) shows that this in fact occurred
and in the presence of the  xxxg393xxx  mab the binding of f-cd3
to the tcr was substantially reduced (overall by 37%) on the
a12 tcr⫹cd45⫹ sub-clone. two distinct populations of cells
differing in their ability to bind cd3 mab were observed when
 xxxd107xxx  was present, presumably reflecting differences
in the degree of interaction between  xxxg393xxx  and the tcr on
different cells. for example, some cells might contain a higher
level of large cd3– xxxg393xxx  complexes in which  xxxd107xxx 
would only mask the binding of f-cd3 to those tcr closest
to  xxxg393xxx , whereas masking by  xxxd107xxx  would be
expected to be more effective for smaller cd3– xxxg393xxx 
aggregates. when we repeated the experiment illustrated in
fig. 6(b), only now using the b8 tcr⫹cd45– sub-clone,
 xxxd107xxx  binding reduced f-cd3 binding overall by only
22%, consistent with the lower cd3– xxxg393xxx  association
detected on this sub-clone by fret analysis (cf. table 2).
why cd3– xxxg393xxx  association is lower on cells lacking cd45
expression is currently unknown. no competitive effects were
noted between other mab pairs tested, including  xxxg393xxx  and
cd4, and  xxxg393xxx  and cd45, on either a12 or b8 sub-clones
(data not shown), consistent with the apparent lack of
association between these antigens as revealed by fret
energy transfer values (table 2).

showed similar energy transfer values (table 2). interestingly,
a significant association of  xxxg393xxx  with the tcr also occurred
on the tcr⫹cd45⫹ sub-clone (fig. 6a), but the energy
transfer efficiency significantly decreased from 25 ⫾ 8% to 7
⫾ 3% in the cells lacking cd45 expression (table 2). no
significant levels of cd4– xxxg393xxx , cd4–cd45 or  xxxg393xxx –cd45

the findings in this paper represent the first molecular analysis
of the signalling functions of the  xxxg393xxx  antigen. ligation of
 xxxg393xxx  in either primary t cells or in  xxxg393xxx -transfected jurkat
t cells results in the induction of a panoply of tyrosine
phosphorylation events similar to those observed upon tcr
stimulation, including tcr zeta phosphorylation (figs 1–4). however,  xxxg393xxx  ligation did not trigger detectable increases in the
calcium signalling pathway (fig. 5). the signalling functions of
 xxxg393xxx  mab are dependent upon the expression of both the
tcr and cd45 at the cell surface (fig. 4), where  xxxg393xxx 
molecules are found in homo-associated clusters as well as
in interaction with the tcr (fig. 6).
our results are consistent with previous reports that the
signalling functions of the gpi-linked molecules thy-1 (23,
39), ly-6a/e (24, 40),  xxxg394xxx  (41) and cd59 (42) are dependent
on tcr expression at the cell surface, and in particular on
the transducing actions of the  xxxg379xxx  (39,40). it is
well established that tcr-mediated signalling events are
dependent on the expression of the cd45 transmembrane
 xxxg401xxx , as demonstrated by the
uncoupling of the tcr from intracellular signals in mutant
cells lacking cd45 expression (43–45), as well as the defects
in thymic development and signalling which occur in cd45–/–
mice (28,46). lack of cd45 expression correlates with hyperphosphorylation and dysfunction of its  xxxg1306xxx  and p59fyn

 xxxg2198xxx  substrates which are involved in the
initiating events of tcr coupling to intracellular signalling
pathways (28,47–49), and evidence that  xxxg1306xxx  is in its hyperphosphorylated dysfunctional conformation has previously
been reported for the cd45– j45.01 jurkat sub-clone used
in the present work (50). our finding that  xxxg393xxx -induced
signalling is dependent on the expression of cd45 is therefore
consistent with a model in which  xxxg393xxx  transduces signals to
the cell interior by utilizing the signalling functions of the tcr
polypeptides in conjunction with the actions of cd45-activated
 xxxg1306xxx  and p59fyn. such a model is supported by the similar
profile of tyrosine phosphorylated substrates induced upon

either tcr or  xxxg393xxx  ligation, including tcr zeta,  xxxg2438xxx , vav
and lat, although the phosphorylation events triggered by
optimal concentrations of  xxxd107xxx  were normally
considerably lower than those induced by the  xxxd2676xxx  mab
(figs 1–4). interestingly, the signalling functions of thy-1 have
also previously been reported to be cd45 dependent (25)
and some  xxxg394xxx -induced signals are also cd45 dependent
(d. r. alexander, unpublished), so it may therefore prove
to be generally the case that gpi-linked molecule signal
transduction depends on the tcr and its cd45-regulated
tyrosine kinases.
a surprising exception to the generalization that  xxxg393xxx  and
cd3 mab appear to trigger similar signals was the finding
that the  xxxg393xxx  mab failed to phosphorylate or activate plcgamma1
in jurkat cells (table 1) nor induce detectable calcium signals
in either primary t cells or in jurkat cells (fig. 5). since
calcium assays were carried out by facs analysis, it is
unlikely that there was a small population of cd52responsive cells present, since these should have been
detected using this technique. however, we cannot exclude
the possibility that calcium transients were induced in single
cells, possibly over a range of times longer than the 30 min
employed in the present work. the finding that the mitogenic

effects of cross-linked  xxxd107xxx  are inhibited by  xxxd1781xxx  (21) certainly points to a role for ca2⫹-activated
calcineurin in the proliferative signalling cascade triggered
by  xxxg393xxx  ligation. our results contrast with those reported for
cd59 mab which induce calcium transients in u937 cells (6),
human neutrophils (51) and in jurkat t cells (42), and with
thy-1 mab which also trigger calcium signals (23). on the
other hand, a  xxxg394xxx  mab did not induce calcium signals in
jurkat t cells (41). the failure of  xxxg393xxx  mab in the present
work to trigger a significant mobilization of intracellular ca2⫹
may reflect the quantitatively lower levels of protein tyrosine
phosphorylation, particularly lat phosphorylation (fig. 4a
and b) induced by  xxxg393xxx  mab in contrast to  xxxd2676xxx . it is
thought that the release of intracellular ca2⫹ in t cells depends
on a complex series of tightly coordinated tcr-induced
molecular events, including plcgamma1 phosphorylation and
recruitment to the plasma membrane, subsequent plcgamma1
activation with the consequent production of inositol trisphosphate, the generation of sufficient phosphatidylinositol
bisphosphate substrate, and the regulation of ion channels
(52), as well as the regulation of these events by lat
phosphorylation (53). further work will be necessary to determine why  xxxd107xxx  does not induce plcgamma1 phosphorylation, insp production and a consequent calcium signal. the
most likely explanation is that the stimulation of lat phosphorylation is too low to allow efficient recruitment of plcgamma1
to the plasma membrane, thereby preventing its effective
phosphorylation and activation.
our finding that  xxxg393xxx  homo-associates, and at the same
time associates with the tcr (fig. 6a and b, table 2),
suggests a model of  xxxg393xxx  signal transduction which may
explain how  xxxg393xxx  ligation utilizes the tcr to induce protein
tyrosine phosphorylation signals, yet without triggering an
observable calcium signal. gpi-anchored proteins are
localized to the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane lipid
bilayer and therefore require one or more transmembrane
proteins to transmit their signals to the cell interior. it appears
that the polypeptides of the tcr fulfil this role. current
evidence suggests that gpi-linked molecules are preferentially localized with glycosphingolipids in distinct microdomains in the cell membrane (53,54) and that membrane
compartmentation is required for efficient t cell activation
(54). gpi-linked molecules are not exclusively localized in
such microdomains, but appear to be in dynamic equilibrium
with other regions of the membrane (55). the extent to which
transmembrane glycoproteins such as cd45 and the tcr
polypeptides are or are not excluded from such microdomains
has not been completely resolved. for example, when lightdensity vesicles enriched in gpi-linked molecules were
prepared in the absence of detergent from t lymphocyte
plasma membranes, they were found to contain only a small
percentage of total cd45 (56), whereas triton-insoluble gpi
molecule-rich fractions prepared from various leukemic cell
lines did contain significant levels of cd45 in one study (57),
but not in another study (58). investigations of intact cells in
the absence of detergent will be required to resolve this issue
(55). our own finding that  xxxg393xxx  associates with the tcr
(fig. 6a and b, table 2) is consistent with the presence of
the tcr within gpi-rich lipid microdomains.
irrespective of the precise location of the tcr and cd45

514 cd45 regulates  xxxd107xxx  ( xxxg393xxx ) t cell signal transduction
in respect to lipid microdomains, we propose that the crosslinking of  xxxg393xxx  mab causes the ‘trapping’ of tcr polypeptides causing their dimerization or oligomerization, thereby
mimicking the effects of a cd3 mab. this is consistent with
the observation that  xxxg393xxx  mab cross-linking is essential for
its mitogenic effects (21) and for inducing intracellular signals,
as shown in the present work, as well as previous studies
which have reported that the cross-linking of other gpi-linked
molecules, such as qa-2 (3) and cd59 (51), are required
for signal transduction. our model thus provides a simple
explanation for the observed similarities between  xxxd2676xxx - and
 xxxd107xxx -triggered phosphorylation events (figs 1–4),
and explains why extensive cross-linking of gpi-linked
molecules is necessary to induce intracellular signals. the
unique way in which gpi-linked molecules are anchored to
the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane may result in
their effectiveness in trapping other cell-surface glycoproteins
upon extensive cross-linking. in fact, it has been shown that
ligation of certain molecules, such as qa-2, induces t cell
activation only when they are anchored by a gpi anchor and
not when expressed as a transmembrane domain-containing
protein (59). according to our model, therefore, the crosslinking antibody might cause trapping of tcr polypeptides
within a molecular complex in a way which does not occur
when non-mitogenic mab to glycoproteins anchored to the
plasma membrane via transmembrane domains, such as
cd45, are utilized. interestingly,  xxxd2676xxx  induces tyrosine
phosphorylation and calcium signals in jurkat t cells without
the requirement for cross-linking, whereas mab cross-linking
is important for its mitogenic effects in primary t cells.
this suggests that tcr dimerization is sufficient for signal
transduction in jurkat t cells, whereas tcr oligomerization
is required for effective signal transduction in primary cells.
in both cases it is noteworthy that the signals triggered by
 xxxd107xxx  are considerably lower than those induced by
 xxxd2676xxx  (figs 2a and b, and 4), suggesting that the association
of tcr polypeptides promoted as an indirect ‘trapping’
consequence of  xxxg393xxx  cross-linking might not be as
effective as that induced by direct  xxxd2676xxx  mab binding. this
could also explain the inability of  xxxd107xxx  to trigger
detectable calcium transients, since partial tcr polypeptide
association might not be sufficient to promote the full gamut
of signals, detailed above, which are essential for the
mobilization of intracellular ca2⫹. the situation may therefore
be analogous to the incomplete signals induced by altered
peptide ligands in t cell clones in which calcium signals are
reduced or even absent (60).
in summary, our results show that  xxxd107xxx  mab crosslinking mediates a panoply of intracellular signals which are
similar to those induced upon tcr stimulation, and which are
dependent upon expression of both the tcr and cd45. our
findings have important therapeutic implications, suggesting
that the construction of humanized mab mutated in the fc
region to prevent mab cross-linking in situ may be important
in the prevention of undesirable side effects.
