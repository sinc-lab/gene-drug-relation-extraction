otulinum neurototoxins (bonts) are the most potent of
known toxins affecting humans (1). these toxins, which
cause botulism, a dramatic and fatal form of intoxication in
humans, are produced by the bacillus clostridium botulinum. the
three main forms of botulism are (i) food-borne botulism caused
by ingestion of the bonts, (ii) wound botulism resulting from
clostridium-infected wounds, and (iii) infant botulism, caused by
toxin production in infant intestines after consumption of the
bacillus spores. although cases of botulism are rare in the united
states, they are all considered medical emergencies, resulting in
death in ⬇10% of cases (2). the recovery period can be many
months and includes intensive care with extensive use of ventilators. bont types a, b, e, and f, which are toxic to humans (3),
have distinctive geographic distributions (2). in the united
states, type a is seen predominately west of the mississippi
river, type b in the eastern states, whereas type e prevails in
alaska and the great lakes area. in europe, meat products can
be sources of type b, whereas vegetable produce in china can
contain type a. preserved fish in japan, russia, and scandinavia
can be a source of type e. given the rapid increase in the
international trade of food products, these geographical distributions of bont types will blur in the near future. additionally,
the potency and ease of distribution of bonts make them a
threat as biological weapons. thus, the centers for disease
control and prevention (cdc) in atlanta lists botulism as one
of the six most dangerous bioterrorist threats (www.bt.cdc.gov兾
agent兾agentlist-category.asp).
vaccination against botulism is available for the three different serotypes of bonts affecting humans, but it requires multiple inoculations over an extended period to prevent intoxication (www.bt.cdc.gov兾agent兾agentlist-category.asp). thus, it is
not feasible to vaccinate entire populations, but rather the
vaccine is used only for the protection of persons with a high risk
of exposure. in addition to supportive therapy, if diagnosed
early, botulism can also be treated immunologically by using an
equine trivalent antitoxin (www.bt.cdc.gov兾agent兾agentlistcategory.asp), or perhaps with recently developed oligoclonal
antibodies (4). this treatment is effective if undertaken early in
the course of intoxication, before the onset of symptoms. thus,
the early detection of the toxin is critical. the most direct way
to detect bont is to inject human serum or stool into mice and

look for signs of botulism (www.bt.cdc.gov兾agent兾agentlistcategory.asp). this mouse bioassay can be performed at some
state health department laboratories and the cdc. it is expensive, time-consuming, and subject to many legal and ethical
constraints. there are attempts to replace the mouse bioassay
by using the nematode caenorhabditis elegans (www.griffin.
peachnet.edu兾cfs兾research兾clostridiumresearch.html). in addition to the use of living animals in early detection, an enzymelinked immunosorbent assay (elisa) that taps into molecular
actions of toxins was developed (5), speeding up the outcome of
an assay from days needed in the case of bioassay to hours
needed in elisa. here we report a bont-b sensor whose
properties allow detection of bont-b within a few minutes.
materials and methods
recombinant proteins. recombinant  xxxg2403xxx  and syntaxin

1a were generated by using modified pet vectors as described
elsewhere (6, 7), resulting in their cytoplasmic domains (amino
acids 1–94 for  xxxg2403xxx  and 1–265 for syntaxin 1a) tagged
with six histidine residues (his6) at their c termini. these
proteins were purified by using nickel-sepharose beads (qiagen,
valencia, ca), and were quantified by sds兾page and staining
with coomassie blue, with bsa as a standard. when subjected
to sds兾page followed by western analysis, the proteins were
loaded at 1 ␮g per lane. we probed membranes by using
monoclonal antibodies against syntaxin 1 (clone hpc-1, sigma),
and against  xxxg2403xxx  (clone 69.1, synaptic systems,
göttingen, germany). immunoreactive bands were detected by
using enhanced chemiluminescence (ecl, amersham biosciences, piscataway, nj).
in experiments using the light chain of bont type b (bont-b;
list biological laboratories, campbell, ca) we incubated 200
ng of toxin with 1 ␮g of recombinant proteins in internal solution
containing 250 ␮m  xxxd3556xxx  at room temperature for 2 h,
whereupon the reaction was stopped by adding 3⫻ gel sample
buffer. the internal solution contained (in mm) potassium
gluconate, 140; nacl, 10; and hepes, 10 (ph 7.35; density ⫽
1.02 g兾ml).
functionalization of beads. we incubated 50 ␮l of nickel-agarose

bead suspension (qiagen, catalog no. 36111; 20–70 ␮m in
diameter) with 18.75 ␮g of recombinant  xxxg2403xxx -his6
(0.17–0.33 mg兾ml), for 1 h at room temperature. this bead兾
protein ratio ensured complete saturation of available nickel
sites on beads. after three washes with internal solution, functionalized beads were kept at 4°c until used in experiments (up
to 36 h). before experiments the beads were applied to the glass
coverslips that were mounted on metal disk atomic force mithis paper was submitted directly (track ii) to the pnas office.

neuroscience

botulinum neurotoxin (bont) types a, b, e, and f are toxic to
humans; early and rapid detection is essential for adequate medical
treatment. presently available tests for detection of bonts, although sensitive, require hours to days. we report a bont-b sensor
whose properties allow detection of bont-b within minutes. the
technique relies on the detection of an agarose bead detachment
from the tip of a micromachined cantilever resulting from bont-b
action on its substratum, the synaptic protein  xxxg2403xxx ,
attached to the beads. the mechanical resonance frequency of the
cantilever is monitored for the detection. to suspend the bead off
the cantilever we use synaptobrevin’s molecular interaction with
another synaptic protein, syntaxin 1a, that was deposited onto the
cantilever tip. additionally, this bead detachment technique is
general and can be used in any displacement reaction, such as in
receptor–ligand pairs, where the introduction of one chemical
leads to the displacement of another. the technique is of broad
interest and will find uses outside toxicology.

functionalization of cantilevers. triangular silicon nitride cantile-

vers (320 ␮m long; digital instruments, santa barbara, ca) with
integral tips were coated with nickel by using a thermal evaporator. after nickel deposition, the tips were functionalized with
syntaxin 1a-his6 recombinant protein by incubating tips in
solution containing proteins (0.16–0.24 mg兾ml) for 3 h at room
temperature. after this incubation the tips were rinsed three
times with an internal solution. functionalized tips were kept
submersed in this internal solution in a humidified chamber at
4°c until used in experiments, up to 36 h.
detection of cantilever resonance. we used nanoscope e and
associated equipment (digital instruments) for the attachment
of the bead and optical detection of cantilever resonance. all
experiments were carried out in a fluid cell that kept the
hydration and osmotic properties of the sample. positioning of
the cantilever tip to attach the functionalized agarose bead and
the raising of the cantilever with the attached bead were done
with a micrometer z-positioner equipped with a stepper motor.
the resonant frequency of the cantilever was excited by using a
wavetek frequency generator to drive a piezoelectric tube with
⬇5-nm amplitude oscillations. a magnetic plate mounted on top
of the piezo selectively excites the nickel-coated cantilever with
the bead. this setup substantially reduces cantilever oscillations
due to fluid cell resonances. note that although the lowest free
cantilever resonance in air is at 6.8 khz, it is substantially
modified to 1 khz (⬇70 hz if bead attached) by immersion in
internal solution. hydrodynamic and viscous effects lead to an
effective increase in the mass of the cantilever and corresponding
lowering of the resonant frequency. other peaks at 300 and 600
hz, and the broad background at higher frequencies result from
fluid and fluid cell dynamics. the maximal time resolution for
individual amplitude spectra was 10 s. to reduce variability, 12
consecutive amplitude spectra were averaged for 2 min and used
to present data.
in experiments using light chain of bont-b, internal solution
was supplemented with bont-b (1–100 nm) and  xxxd3556xxx 
(250 ␮m). this solution was injected into the fluid cell by using
microfluidic ports, resulting in 2.4- to 3-fold dilution of bontb兾zn2⫹. the final concentrations of bont-b兾zn2⫹ reported in
this work were adjusted to accommodate dilution factors.
indirect immunochemistry. the presence of syntaxin 1a on func-

tionalized tips and  xxxg2403xxx  on functionalized beads was
determined by indirect immunochemistry that was performed by
using the same antibodies as in western blot analysis. cantilevers
were incubated with the primary antibody for 1 h at room
temperature, followed by triple washing with internal solution.
the rhodamine-conjugated secondary antibody was applied and
the preparation was incubated for 1 h at room temperature
followed by a triple washout in internal solution. in experiments
in which we increased the protonation of histidine residues, after
functionalization of the cantilevers we incubated them for 30 min
at room temperature with the modified internal solution containing (in mm) potassium gluconate, 140; nacl, 10, and citric
acid, 1 (ph 4.75).
for labeling of  xxxg2403xxx  on beads, before the application of primary antibody, beads were incubated with 5% nonfat
dry milk to prevent nonspecific binding. in experiments using the
light chain of bont-b, we incubated functionalized beads before
labeling procedure in an internal solution supplemented with
100 nm bont-b and 250 ␮m  xxxd3556xxx  at room temperature
for 2 h. both tips and beads were kept hydrated until used in
experiments.

terminus of recombinant syntaxin 1a, which is similarly attached by means of
a c-terminal histidine tag to the nickel-coated cantilever tip. the  xxxg2403xxx –syntaxin intermolecular interaction leads to the bead’s being tethered
to the cantilever tip. bont-b in the presence of zinc ions (zn2⫹) cleaves
 xxxg2403xxx  in such manner that the short fragment of  xxxg2403xxx 
remaining on the bead has no ability to interact with syntaxin 1a on the

microscope (nikon te 300) equipped with wide-field epifluorescence (opti-quip, highland mills, ny; 100-w xenon arc
lamp), and a standard rhodamine filter set (chroma technology,
brattleboro, vt). images were captured through a ⫻20 air
objective (nikon) by using a coolsnap-hq cooled chargecoupled device (ccd) camera (roper scientific, tucson, az)
driven by v⫹⫹ imaging software (digital optics, auckland, new
zealand). to reduce bleaching of the sample, an electronic
shutter (vincent associates, rochester, ny) was inserted in the
excitation pathway and controlled by the software. bright-field
images were acquired with a green interference filter (gif)
inserted in the light path of a halogen lamp. all images presented
in the figures represent raw data.
results and discussion
the sensor is based on the extraordinary force detection sensitivity available with microfabricated cantilevers (8–14). a schematic of the setup is shown in fig. 1. the technique relies on the
detection of agarose bead detachment from micromachined
cantilever tips due to the enzymatic action of bont-b on its
substratum, the synaptic protein  xxxg2403xxx , also known as
vamp 2 (15, 16). nickel-agarose beads were functionalized with
recombinant  xxxg2403xxx  conjugated to six consecutive his
residues at its c terminus (sb2-h6) (7). to suspend the bead off
the cantilever tip we used synaptobrevin’s molecular interaction
with another synaptic protein, syntaxin 1a (17). we used
commercially available afm cantilevers that were nickel-coated
and then functionalized them with a recombinant synaptic
protein, syntaxin 1a conjugated to a his6 tag at its c terminus
(sx1a-h6) (6). as both synaptic proteins were tagged at their c
termini, their intermolecular n-terminal interactions are still
allowed. the strength of this intermolecular interaction allowed
us to keep the bead suspended off the cantilever tip until the
delivery of bont-b. this toxin cleaves  xxxg2403xxx  in such
a manner that the bead containing a short fragment of  xxxg2403xxx  detaches from the cantilever tip. note that a single
intermolecular syntaxin–synaptobrevin interaction is sufficient
to hang a 41-␮m-diameter bead off the cantilever tip, given the
buoyancy of the bead in the fluid and the measured syntaxin–
synaptobrevin interaction strength of 250 pn, when the afm
liu et al.

force spectroscopy technique (18) is used. thus, this sensor
methodology is highly sensitive, being based on the rupture of a
single molecular bond (18–22). chemically modified resonating
cantilevers have been used as sensors primarily in gaseous and
vacuum environments. they have relatively poor sensitivity in
fluids because of hydrodynamic and viscous effects (23, 24).
however, in the sensor technique reported here, even in fluids
there is a large effective mass change of the cantilever due to the
detachment of the bead, while it simultaneously retains high
sensitivity.
before attaching the recombinant syntaxin 1a and  xxxg2403xxx  proteins to the cantilever tips and beads, respectively, we
confirmed the specificity of bont-b to cleave sb2-h6, but not
sx1a-h6, by incubating these proteins with bont-b and then
subjecting them to sds兾page (fig. 2) (25). subsequent westliu et al.

ern blot analysis revealed that bont-b in the presence of zinc
ions cleaved only sb2-h6 (fig. 2f), whereas sx1a-h6 (fig. 2a)
was not affected by the action of this toxin. additionally,
bont-b alone, without externally added zinc ions, did not cleave
sb2-h6 (data not shown). these results are consistent with
previous reports of toxin molecular actions (15, 16, 26). after
this demonstration that our recombinant proteins show the same
susceptibility to bont-b as the native proteins do, we proceeded
to use these proteins in the functionalization of cantilever tips
and beads.
commercially available 320-␮m-long triangular silicon nitride
afm cantilevers were coated with nickel by using a thermal
evaporator, resulting in nickel films (thickness ⬇150 nm) that are
partially oxidized on exposure to air. after this nickel deposition,
the tips were functionalized with sx1a-h6 recombinant protein.

blot analysis in a. (d) beads functionalized with sb2-h6 (⫹) showed positive
immunoreactivity compared with control beads for which sb2-h6 was not
attached to the bead (⫺). treatment of the functionalized beads with zn2⫹

were acoustically vibrated by means of a piezo driven by a function generator.
the vibration amplitude of the cantilever was monitored by using the difference signal from a split photodiode system that collects the red laser beam
reflected off the back of the cantilever. a phase-sensitive detector was used to
measure the vibration amplitude as a function of the frequency, and the data
were recorded in a digital oscilloscope and later exported to a computer. (b)

istry. monoclonal antibody against syntaxin 1a (27) revealed the
presence of this recombinant protein only on functionalized
cantilevers, but not on the control cantilevers from which
recombinant proteins were omitted during the functionalization
procedure (fig. 2 b and c). similarly, incubation of nickelnitrilotriacetate (nta) agarose beads with recombinant sb2-h6
resulted in functionalization of beads (fig. 2 d and e) as
detected by the monoclonal antibody directed against the n
terminus of  xxxg2403xxx  (28). we incubated these functionalized cantilevers and beads with bont-b to check whether the
toxin reacts with the immobilized recombinant proteins. because
bont-b is a zinc endopeptidase (26), and we showed the lack of
its action on sb2-h6 in the absence of externally added zinc, we
added zinc ions to ensure bont-b reactions. we find that
bont-b in the presence of zinc ions, but not zinc ions alone,
causes the reduction in immunoreactivity of synaptobrevin
2-functionalized beads (fig. 2 d and e), whereas we recorded no
decrease in immunoreactivity of syntaxin 1a-functionalized tips
(fig. 2 b and c). however, when we decreased the ph from 7.35
to 4.75 to cause protonation of histidine residues, a treatment
known to disturb the nickel–histidine coordination, we observed
the reduction in immunoreactivity on afm tips caused by
detachment of previously immobilized recombinant proteins
(data not shown). taken together, the data indicate that
bont-b specifically cleaves immobilized  xxxg2403xxx , and
that zinc ions do not significantly affect the nickel–histidine
coordination.
after this initial confirmation of the protein deposition specificity and bont-b actions, we tested the feasibility of the
proposed sensor. a schematic of the experimental setup is shown
in fig. 3a. the syntaxin 1a-functionalized cantilevers were
loaded into an afm head with the fluid cell containing internal
saline. next,  xxxg2403xxx -functionalized nickel-agarose
beads were introduced into the fluid cell. an optical microscope
was used to locate the beads. the cantilever was lowered until its
tip came into contact with a bead (fig. 1 a). this contact allowed
the establishment of the syntaxin–synaptobrevin intermolecular
interaction, leading to the attachment of the bead to the
cantilever tip. the cantilever was then raised with the bead
attached to the tip (fig. 3 a and b). next, the cantilever was
vibrated by means of a piezo driven by a function generator. a
magnetic plate mounted on top of the piezo was used to
preferentially excite the nickel-coated cantilever兾bead. this
setup prevented the excitation of fluid cell resonances that
13624 兩 www.pnas.org兾cgi兾doi兾10.1073兾pnas.2233819100

normally arise from acoustic vibration (23, 24). the vibration
amplitude of the piezo was around 5 nm. frequencies from 10
hz to 2 khz were logarithmically scanned to locate the resonance
frequency. the vibration of the cantilever was monitored by
using the standard afm optical lever technique. a phasesensitive detector was used to measure the vibration amplitude
of the cantilever as a function of the frequency. a typical
amplitude spectrum obtained for the bead attached to the
cantilever is shown in fig. 3b. the lowest-order resonance
attributable to the cantilever–bead system is shown with the
arrow at 70 hz. this cantilever–bead configuration resulting
from the synaptobrevin–syntaxin intermolecular interactions
was stable for several hours at room temperature (6 of 6 tested).
next we injected a solution containing bont-b (8–42 nm) and
zinc ions (bont-b兾zn2⫹) into the fluid cell. the bead detached
(18 of 19 tested) from the cantilever after the introduction of the
bont-b兾zn2⫹ (figs. 3c and 4) but not after introduction of
zn2⫹ alone (0 of 6 tested) (fig. 4b), resulting in the disappearance of the sharp cantilever–bead resonance peak at 70 hz (fig.
3b; arrow) and the appearance of the bare (no bead) cantilever
resonance peak at 1.0 khz (fig. 3c; arrow). we optically
confirmed the detachment of the bead. note that the resonant
frequencies of the cantilever were measured in a fluid environment and are thus modified by a factor of 6.8 from their vacuum
values because of hydrodynamic and viscous effects (23, 24).
the sensitivity of the sensor to the bont-b concentration was
next studied (fig. 4). we applied various concentrations of
bont-b, ranging from 0.3 to 42 nm, to our sensor. in fig. 4a
we show the change in the vibration amplitude of the cantilever
loaded with the bead as a function of time. after delivery of zn2⫹
(83–104 ␮m) alone the bead remained attached to the cantilever
for times ⬎30 min (fig. 4a, f). however, after introduction of
bont-b兾zn2⫹ the amplitude reduced to the background value
within minutes, indicating the detachment of the bead (fig. 4a,
‚). the change in amplitude is abrupt and can be used as a
digital trigger. the time taken for the detachment of the bead as
a function of the bont-b concentration (fig. 4b) indicates the
reaction time of the system. the threshold of bont-b detection,
defined as a bead detachment within 15 min after addition of
bont-b, was 8 nm.
we have generated a sensor for the rapid and reliable detection of the neurotoxin bont-b. the sensor presently allows the
detection of toxin at concentrations greater than 8 nm within
minutes. thus, while offering much better speeds of detection
liu et al.

compared with mouse assays and elisas, this sensor presently
has lower sensitivity. the principle of the sensor is based on the
change in the resonance frequency of a microfabricated cantilever resulting from the detachment of an attached bead as a
consequence of the biochemical reactions carried out by a toxin.
in the case of endopeptidase bont-b the reaction is related to
the cleavage of the synaptic vesicle protein  xxxg2403xxx . the
cleavage of  xxxg2403xxx  molecules leads to bead detachment
and thus a large mass change to the cantilever–bead system. this
change results in a clear and large resonant frequency shift even
in a highly damped solution environment. this technique of
frequency change from bead detachment is general and can also
be implemented in displacement reactions, such as in receptor–
ligand pairs, where the introduction of one molecule leads to the
displacement of another. thus, the sensor we have developed is
