abstract: amp-forming  xxxg51xxx  [acs; acetate:coa ligase (amp-forming), ec 6.2.1.1]
catalyzes the activation of acetate to acetyl-coa in a two-step reaction. this enzyme is a member of the
adenylate-forming enzyme superfamily that includes firefly luciferase, nonribosomal peptide synthetases,
and acyl- and aryl-coa synthetases/ligases. although the structures of several superfamily members
demonstrate that these enzymes have a similar fold and domain structure, the low sequence conservation
and diversity of the substrates utilized have limited the utility of these structures in understanding substrate
binding in more distantly related enzymes in this superfamily. the crystal structures of the salmonella
enterica acs and saccharomyces cerevisiae  xxxg47xxx  have allowed a directed approach to investigating
substrate binding and catalysis in acs. in the s. enterica acs structure, the propyl group of adenosine
5′-propylphosphate, which mimics the acyl-adenylate intermediate, lies in a hydrophobic pocket. modeling
of the methanothermobacter thermautotrophicus z245 acs (mt- xxxg47xxx ) on the s. cerevisiae acs structure
showed similar active site architecture, and alignment of the amino acid sequences of proven acss indicates
that the four residues that compose the putative acetate binding pocket are well conserved. these four
residues, ile312, thr313, val388, and trp416 of mt- xxxg47xxx , were targeted for alteration, and our results support
that they do indeed form the acetate binding pocket and that alterations at these positions significantly
alter the enzyme’s affinity for acetate as well as the range of acyl substrates that can be utilized. in
particular, trp416 appears to be the primary determinant for acyl chain length that can be accommodated
in the binding site.

amp-forming  xxxg51xxx  [acs;1 acetate:coa
ligase (amp-forming), ec 6.2.1.1] catalyzes the activation
of acetate to acetyl-coa in a two-step reaction (eqs 1a and
1b) involving formation of an acetyl-adenylate enzymebound intermediate in the first step (1-4):

acs is a member of the adenylate-forming enzyme superfamily that contains three subfamilies: the acyl- and arylcoa synthetases, the adenylation domain of nonribosomal
peptide synthetases (nrps), and firefly luciferase (5). these
enzymes share limited sequence homology, but all catalyze
a two-step reaction in which an enzyme-bound acyl-adenylate
is formed in the first half-reaction and, for most enzymes in
this superfamily, a thioester product is formed from the acyladenylate intermediate in the second half-reaction.
although sequence identity among distant members of the
superfamily is low, three conserved signature motifs have

of this investigation); motif ii, y[lwf]-g[smw]-x-t[a]e (residues 415-419 in mt- xxxg47xxx ); and motif iii, y[fl]r[kx]-t[sv]-g-d (residues 498-502 in mt- xxxg47xxx ), in
which the boldface residues represent those that predominate
at each position, the residues in brackets represent the most
common alternative residues observed, and x represents hypervariable positions. previous investigations into substrate
binding and catalysis in this superfamily have focused primarily on conserved motifs i and ii (5-10). the crystal structures of several members of the adenylate-forming enzyme
superfamily indicate that these enzymes have a large nterminal domain and a smaller ∼110 amino acid c-terminal
domain with the active site located at the interface between
the two domains (9, 11, 12). the crystal structures of firefly
luciferase and other members of the superfamily revealed
that motifs i, ii, and iii are all located on the surface at the
domain interface (11), supporting a role for these motifs in
substrate binding and catalysis. in addition to the signature
motifs, ten conserved core sequence motifs have been
identified for the nonribosomal peptide synthetases, of which
seven are conserved in the acyl-coa synthetases (13-16).
the crystal structures of the salmonella enterica acs (16)
and saccharomyces cerevisiae  xxxg47xxx  (17) have allowed a
directed approach to investigating substrate binding and
catalysis in acs. the s. cerevisiae  xxxg47xxx  was crystallized
in the presence of atp but in the absence of acetate (17).

acetate binding in  xxxg51xxx 
its c-terminal domain is positioned away from the n-terminal
domain in the conformation thought to be responsible for
catalysis of the first step of the reaction (17). the s. enterica
acs enzyme was crystallized in the presence of coa and
adenosine 5′-propylphosphate, an inhibitor that mimics the
acetyl-adenylate intermediate (7, 18). in this structure, the
c-terminal domain is rotated 140° toward the n-terminal
domain for catalysis of the second step of the reaction (16).
the propyl group of the adenosine 5′-propylphosphate
inhibitor is located in a position similar to that of the
phenylalanine substrate in the structure of  xxxd2901xxx , the phenylalanine adenylation domain of the nrps gramicidin
synthetase 1. thus, although acs adopts this conformation
after formation of the acyl-adenylate intermediate and is
poised to catalyze the second half-reaction, the position of
the propyl group likely approximates the position of the
acetate substrate of acs.
in this paper, we report the identification of the acetate
binding pocket in the m. thermautotrophicus  xxxg47xxx  (designated as mt- xxxg47xxx ). our characterization of this enzyme
(30) has shown that mt- xxxg47xxx  has a higher turnover rate
but similar affinity for substrates as the s. enterica acs (j.
thurman, c. ingram-smith, k. zimowski, and k. s. smith,
manuscript in preparation), making it an excellent candidate
for studies on substrate binding. through inspection of the
s. enterica acs structure, modeling of the m. thermautotrophicus mt- xxxg47xxx  on the s. cerevisiae  xxxg47xxx  and s.
enterica acs structures, and alignment of acs sequences,
we have identified four residues that form the putative acetate
binding pocket. these residues have been targeted for
alteration to investigate their roles in acetate binding and
catalysis. the results support that ile312, thr313, val388, and
trp416 do indeed form the acetate binding pocket and that
replacements at these positions significantly alter the enzyme’s affinity for acetate as well as the range of acyl
substrates that can be utilized.
experimental procedures
materials. chemicals were purchased from vwr scientific products, fisher scientific, or sigma chemicals. oligonucleotides for site-directed mutagenesis were purchased
from integrated dna technologies. ird-700 and ird-800
labeled oligonucleotides for dna sequencing were purchased
from li-cor biosciences or mwg biotech.
site-directed mutagenesis. site-directed mutagenesis of
the gene encoding the m. thermautotrophicus z245 mtacs1 was performed using the quikchange site-directed
mutagenesis kit (stratagene) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. mutagenic primers were 30-40 nucleotides in
length with the altered base(s) located at the middle of the
sequence. the sequence alterations were confirmed by licor bidirectional sequencing at the nucleic acid facility at
clemson university using the thermo sequenase primer
cycle sequencing kit (ge healthcare).
analysis of short-chain acyl-coa synthetase sequences.
searches of the nonredundant sequence databases at the
national center for biotechnology information (ncbi) were
performed with the blastp and tblastn programs (19,
20) using the mt- xxxg47xxx  sequence as the query. sequences
were aligned by clustal x (21) using a gonnet pam 250
weight matrix with a gap opening penalty of 10.0 and a gap

biochemistry, vol. 45, no. 38, 2006 11483
extension penalty of 0.05. sequence identity between mtacs1 and other sacss was determined using the blast2
pairwise sequence alignment program available at ncbi
(http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast/bl2seq/wblast2.cgi).
heterologous production and purification of mt- xxxg47xxx 
variants. wild-type mt- xxxg47xxx  and its variants were heterologously produced in escherichia coli rosetta blue(de3)
(novagen) as described elsewhere (30). cells were grown
at 37 °c to an absorbance of 0.4-0.6 at 600 nm, and
production of the wild-type enzyme or enzyme variant was
induced by the addition of iptg to a final concentration of
0.5 mm. cells were incubated at 200 rpm overnight at
ambient temperature and harvested. cell-free extract was
prepared by resuspending the cells in buffer a [25 mm tris
(ph 7.5)] and passing them twice through a french pressure
cell at 138 mpa. the extracts were clarified by ultracentrifugation, and the supernatant was subjected to column
chromatography. cell-free extracts were applied to a qsepharose fast-flow anion-exchange column (ge healthcare)
which was developed with a linear gradient from 0 to 1 m
kcl in buffer a [25 mm tris (ph 7.5)]. appropriate fractions
as determined by sds-page and activity assays were
pooled and diluted with 0.5 volume of buffer b [25 mm
tris (ph 7.0)] containing 2 m ammonium sulfate and applied
to a phenyl-sepharose fast-flow hydrophobic interaction
column (ge healthcare) which was developed with a
gradient from 0.7 to 0 m ammonium sulfate in buffer b.
fractions containing the purified variant enzyme were pooled
and dialyzed against buffer b and concentrated to >1 mg/
ml. an additional source q (ge healthcare) anion-exchange
chromatography step was added if the variant enzyme was
not sufficiently pure after the first two steps. the source q
column was developed with a linear gradient of 0-1 m kcl
in buffer b, and the purified enzyme was dialyzed and
concentrated. aliquots of each purified protein were stored
at -20 °c. protein concentration was determined by the
bradford method (22).
enzymatic assays for acs activity. enzymatic activity was
determined by monitoring acyl-coa formation using the
hydroxamate reaction (23, 24), in which activated acyl groups
are converted to an acyl-hydroxamate and subsequently to a
ferric hydroxamate complex that is detected spectrophotometrically at 540 nm. the standard reactions contained 100
mm tris (ph 7.5), 600 mm hydroxylamine hydrochloride
(ph 7.0), and 2 mm glutathione (reduced form) in addition
to the three substrates ( xxxd1739xxx , mgatp, and acyl substrate)
in  xxxd3426xxx  µl reaction volume. in all cases, the mg2+ and
atp were equimolar concentrations. the reactions were
performed at 65 °c, the optimal temperature for this enzyme
(30), and terminated by the addition of two volumes of stop
solution (1 n hcl, 5% trichloroacetic acid, 1.25% fecl2).
for determination of apparent kinetic parameters, the
concentration of one substrate (acyl substrate,  xxxd1739xxx , or
mgatp) was varied and the other two substrates were held
constant at saturating level (generally 10 times the km value
for those substrates). concentrations for the varied substrate
generally ranged from 0.2 to 5-10 times the km value. in
cases in which the acyl substrate was soluble in ethanol but
not water, the final concentration of ethanol in the reaction
was kept constant at 2%. this concentration was determined
to have minimal effect on enzymatic activity (data not
shown). the steady-state parameters kcat and kcat/km and their

ds modeler 1.1, and the stereo image of the putative active site acetate binding pocket was created using ds viewerpro 5.0. residues

standard errors were determined using nonlinear regression
to fit the data to the michaelis-menten equation using
kaleidagraph (synergy software). the enzyme variants
followed michaelis-menten kinetics for all substrates. the
wild-type enzyme showed inhibition above 0.5 mm  xxxd1739xxx ,
in which case the kinetic parameters for the other substrates
were determined in the presence of 0.5 mm  xxxd1739xxx  and
must be considered apparent values (30).
molecular mass determination. the native molecular
masses of the variants were determined by gel filtration
chromatography using a superose 12 gel filtration column
(ge healthcare) calibrated with chymotrypsinogen (25 kda),
ovalbumin (43 kda), albumin (67 kda), aldolase (158 kda),
catalase (232 kda), ferritin (440 kda), and blue dextran (2000
kda). the column was preequilibrated with 50 mm tris (ph
7.5) containing 150 mm kcl and developed at a flow rate
of 0.5 ml/min.
modeling the mt- xxxg47xxx  structure and the putative acetate
binding pocket. the m. thermautotrophicus mt- xxxg47xxx 
structure was modeled on both the s. enterica acs structure
(pdb id: 1pg4) and the s. cerevisiae  xxxg47xxx  structure (pdb
id: 1ry2) using ds modeler (accelrys) using the standard
parameters built into the program. the structures were
visualized with ds visualizer (accelrys) and ds viewer
pro 5.0 (accelrys). the mt- xxxg47xxx  models were visually
compared to the s. enterica and s. cerevisiae acs structures
to ensure that there were no major structural anomalies.
results
identification of the putative acetate binding pocket. the
crystal structure of the s. enterica acs was solved in the

presence of coa and adenosine 5′-propylphosphate (16), a
mimic of the enzyme-bound acetyl-amp intermediate (7,
18). inspection of the s. enterica acs structure revealed a
hydrophobic pocket consisting of val310, val386, and trp414
in proximity to the propyl group of adenosine 5′-propylphosphate. in addition, thr311 is located in the immediate vicinity
and appears to form a wall of this pocket. the propyl group
of the inhibitor may provide an approximation for the
position of acetate bound in the active site; therefore, this
hydrophobic pocket may thus represent the acetate binding
pocket of acs.
the m. thermautotrophicus z245 mt- xxxg47xxx  was modeled
on the s. enterica acs and s. cerevisiae  xxxg47xxx  structures.
both of these models were highly analogous to the structures
on which they were based (data not shown). the mt- xxxg47xxx 
model of the s. enterica acs structure indicates that ile312,
thr313, val388, and trp416 form a hydrophobic pocket
positioned similarly to that formed by val310, thr311, val386,
and trp414 of the s. enterica enzyme, in this model, the
propyl group of adenosine 5′-propylphosphate points directly
into the pocket toward trp416 and is surrounded on three sides
by ile312, thr313, and val388 (figure 1). thus, these four
residues were suitable candidates for site-directed replacement to determine whether alteration of this pocket influenced acetate affinity and catalysis.
the residues that form the putative acetate binding pocket
would be expected to be highly conserved among the acss.
for short/medium-chain acyl-coa synthetases (sacs) that
show a preference for acyl substrates other than acetate, it
would be expected that one or more conserved residues that
form the acetate binding pocket in acs would be replaced

with smaller residues in order to increase the size of the
pocket to accommodate longer straight-chain acyl substrates
or the bulkier branched-chain acyl substrates. indeed, alignment of the sequences of proven acss and sacss bears
out these predictions (figure 2).
the sacss shown in figure 2 show different substrate
preferences, ranging from acetate and propionate for acs
and propionyl-coa synthetase (pcs) (7) to isobutyrate for
sa and octanoate for macs1 (25). the acyl substrate
preference has not yet been determined for  xxxg1889xxx , a sacs
from e. coli, but this enzyme has been shown to utilize
substrates ranging from hexanoate to  xxxd1821xxx  (26). thr313,
val388, and trp416 of mt- xxxg47xxx  are completely conserved
among the acss, and ile312 is well conserved. sacss that
utilize these longer chain acyl substrates do indeed have
alterations at one or more equivalent positions (figure 2).
perhaps the most interesting observations from the alignment
in figure 2 are the replacements at val388 and trp416. val388
is replaced by ala in pcs and sa but by the smaller residue
gly in macs1 and  xxxg1889xxx , which utilize longer acyl
substrates. trp416 is conserved in the acss and pcs but is
universally replaced by gly in sacss that utilize longer acyl
substrates.
purification of wild-type and variant acss. each of the
four residues (ile312, thr313, val388, and trp416) postulated to
form part of the acetate binding pocket of the m. thermautotrophicus mt- xxxg47xxx  was individually subjected to sitedirected replacement with amino acid residues present in
other sacss (figure 2). the variants displayed behavior
similar to that of the wild-type enzyme in each chromato-

graphic step, the subunit molecular masses were indistinguishable from that of the wild-type enzyme as determined
by sds-page (data not shown), and gel filtration chromatography indicated that the variants were dimeric, as for
the wild-type enzyme. these results suggest that the purified
variants had not undergone major structural changes.
kinetic parameters for the ile312 and thr313 variants. the
kinetic constants for acyl substrate utilization by the wildtype enzyme and the ile312 and thr313 variants are shown in
table 1. although acetate was the preferred substrate over
propionate for the ile312ala variant, as indicated by the higher
catalytic efficiency (kcat/km), the difference in catalytic
efficiency with these two substrates is only 5.0-fold, as
compared to a 14.3-fold difference in the catalytic efficiency
of the wild-type enzyme with acetate versus propionate.
whereas the wild-type enzyme can only utilize acetate and
propionate as the acyl substrate, this variant has gained the
ability to utilize butyrate as a substrate, albeit a poor one,
but cannot use longer acyl substrates or branched-chain acyl
substrates.
the thr313val variant demonstrated a 7-8-fold greater
affinity for acetate and propionate as compared to the wildtype enzyme. in fact, the km for propionate for the thr313val variant was only slightly higher than that observed for
the wild-type enzyme with acetate. as for the ile312ala
variant, the thr313val variant showed weaker preference for
acetate versus propionate than observed for the wild-type
enzyme (5.6-fold as compared to 14.3-fold). the thr313lys
variant proved to be a poor enzyme with a weak affinity for
acetate and over a 5000-fold reduction in catalytic efficiency

as compared to the wild-type enzyme. this enzyme had very
weak but detectable activity with propionate that was too
low for determination of kinetic parameters. neither of the
thr313 variants was able to utilize butyrate or branched-chain
substrates.
kinetic parameters for the val388 variants. kinetic
parameters for the val388 variants are shown in table 2.
alteration of val388 to ala resulted in a shift in substrate
preference from acetate to propionate. the km for acetate
increased 3.8-fold relative to that of the wild-type enzyme
(table 2) whereas that for propionate decreased 8.9-fold.
interestingly, the catalytic efficiency with propionate as the
substrate was increased in the variant relative to that observed
for the wild-type enzyme, and in fact, the variant showed a
slightly higher catalytic efficiency with propionate than with
acetate. unlike the wild-type enzyme, this variant was able
to utilize butyrate, although this was a poor substrate. longer
acyl substrates and branched-chain substrates could not serve
as a substrate for this variant.
the val388gly variant had a 47-fold higher km for acetate
but only a 2-fold lower turnover rate as compared to the
wild-type enzyme. the effect of the alteration on the km for
propionate was less dramatic, but the overall catalytic
efficiency with propionate was 26-fold reduced relative to
the wild-type enzyme. overall, the variant showed only a
4-fold preference for acetate as the substrate as compared
to a 14.3-fold preference for the unaltered enzyme. unlike
the val388ala variant, this variant was unable to utilize
butyrate.
kinetic parameters for the trp416 variants. a trp416gly
alteration had a very dramatic effect on mt- xxxg47xxx  substrate
range and preference. whereas the wild-type enzyme can
utilize only acetate and propionate but not larger substrates
such as butyrate or valerate or branched-chain acyl substrates,
the substrates utilized by the trp416gly variant ranged from
the two-carbon acetate to the eight-carbon octanoate. the
enzyme was also able to utilize the branched-chain substrates
2-, 3-, and 4-methylvalerate (table 3) but was unable to
utilize 2-methylpropionate, 2-methylbutyrate, and 3-methylbutyrate. the lowest km values were observed with
hexanoate and 4-methylvalerate and were less than 2.2-fold
higher than the km of the wild-type enzyme for acetate.
the highest turnover rate for the trp416gly variant was
observed with acetate; however, the high km value made this
a catalytically inefficient substrate. although the kcat values
generally decreased as the substrate length increased, the km
values also decreased for longer chain substrates. thus, the
trp416gly alteration shifted substrate preference from acetate,
with a kcat/km of only 0.26 s-1 mm-1, to valerate, hexanoate,
and 4-methylvalerate, with 3.7-5.4-fold higher kcat/km
values.

atp and coa utilization by the mt- xxxg47xxx  variants. the
kinetic constants for atp and coa shown in table 4 for
the wild-type and variant enzymes were determined using
the acyl substrate that provided the highest catalytic efficiency for each enzyme. except for the thr313val and
thr313lys variants, the km values for atp and coa showed
less than 3-fold difference for the variants as compared to
the wild-type enzyme. these results support that the overall
structure of the active site is not altered in the ile312, val388,
and trp416 variants.
with the thr313lys variant, activity was detected using
the hydroxamate assay even in the absence of coa. as the
hydroxamate reaction is not specific for detection of acetylcoa but instead detects activated acyl groups, production
of an activated acetyl group in the absence of coa suggests
that the thr313lys variant may release the acetyl-adenylate
intermediate and cannot catalyze the second step of the acs
reaction. for wild-type mt- xxxg47xxx , no product was detected

acetate binding in  xxxg51xxx

not shown), indicating that the enzyme-bound acyl-adenylate
intermediate is not detected by the hydroxamate reaction.
inorganic pyrophosphate was detected as one of the products
of the reaction catalyzed by the thr313lys variant using an
 xxxg1804xxx  assay (data not shown), suggesting that this variant catalyzes the first step of the reaction to
form the expected products.
discussion
although members of the acyl-adenylate-forming enzyme
superfamily all catalyze mechanistically similar two-step
reactions, they share little identity and similarity in amino
acid sequence with the exception of a few signature and core
motifs. the crystal structures of several diverse members of
this superfamily have revealed that these enzymes adopt a
similar two-domain structure in which the active site resides
in the cleft between the n- and c-terminal domains. these
enzymes are all thought to adopt two different conformations
in which alternation of the c-terminal domain after catalysis
of the first step of the reaction restructures the active site
for catalysis of the second half-reaction.
despite the structural similarities, the diversity of substrates and the divergence in primary sequence among enzymes in this superfamily have limited the utility of distantly
related structures in identifying primary determinants for
binding of the acyl substrate in acs and other short-chain
acyl-coa synthetases. the structures of the s. enterica acs
and the s. cerevisiae  xxxg47xxx  provide direct insight into the
active site residues of acs. although the yeast acs structure
does not include bound acetate, a comparison of the two acs
structures indicates that the positions of the residues located
in the putative acetate binding pocket remain relatively
unaffected by domain alternation.
the location of the propyl group of the adenosine
5′-propylphosphate present in the structure of the s. enterica
acs provides an approximation of where the acetate binding
pocket resides in acs (16). however, our kinetic characterization of the salmonella typhimurium acs, which has
the identical sequence as the s. enterica acs, indicated that
the activity of this enzyme is prohibitively low for characterization of enzyme variants with greatly reduced activity
(j. thurman, c. ingram-smith, k. zimowski, and k. s.
smith, manuscript in preparation). sequence alignment and
modeling of mt- xxxg47xxx  on the s. enterica and s. cerevisiae
acs structures suggest that the active sites of these enzymes
are highly conserved. thus, mt- xxxg47xxx  was a suitable
enzyme for our studies on substrate binding in acs using
information derived from the acs crystal structures. furthermore, the higher turnover rate of mt- xxxg47xxx  allowed
variants with greatly reduced activity to be kinetically
characterized to determine whether the effect of the alteration
is on substrate affinity, catalysis, or both.
in this study, four residues that comprise a hydrophobic
pocket in the vicinity of the propyl group of the adenosine
5′-propylphosphate in the mt- xxxg47xxx  model (figure 1) were
targeted for site-directed replacement to determine whether
they do indeed form the acetate binding site. each of these
residues was individually altered in order to examine their
individual contributions to acyl substrate binding in terms
of both substrate affinity and the size of the acyl substrate
that can be accommodated. the high catalytic activity of

biochemistry, vol. 45, no. 38, 2006 11487
mt- xxxg47xxx  has allowed variants with low activity to be
characterized to determine whether the alteration affects
substrate affinity, catalysis, or both.
trp416 and val388 were found to have the strongest
influence on acyl substrate utilization. alteration of trp416
proved to have a dramatic effect on both substrate range and
substrate preference for mt- xxxg47xxx . acss and pcss have
trp at the position equivalent to trp416 of mt- xxxg47xxx  (figure
2). enzymes such as sa, macs1, and  xxxg1889xxx  that show a
preference for longer acyl substrates have gly at this position
instead of trp (figure 2). remarkably, the trp416gly variant
was able to utilize substrates as large as octanoate and also
utilized branched-chain acyl substrates in addition to straightchain acyl substrates (table 3).
the trp416 variant had weak affinity for acetate and
propionate, the only two acyl substrates utilized by the wildtype enzyme. instead, the enzyme had the strongest affinity
for hexanoate,  xxxd2269xxx , and valerate and showed the
highest catalytic efficiency with the branched-chain substrate
4-methylvalerate, followed by valerate, hexanoate, and
 xxxd2269xxx . thus, it appears that removal of the trp side
chain from the hydrophobic pocket is sufficient to enlarge
the pocket to accommodate longer substrates in preference
to acetate and propionate. a model of the trp416gly variant
(figure 3) is consistent with this. in this model, the
propylphosphate group (shown in aqua) was increased in
length by two methylenes to mimic binding of valerate. it is
readily apparent that removal of the bulky side chain allows
the pocket to accommodate a longer substrate without steric
hindrance as would be observed in the wild-type enzyme.
it should be noted that the overall catalytic efficiency of
the wild-type enzyme is 13-fold higher than that observed
for the trp416gly variant with its best substrate, 4-methylvalerate. however, the turnover rate of the variant with acetate is reduced only 2-fold from the wild-type enzyme, indicating that catalysis itself is not significantly impaired. this
suggests that although the variant can bind longer substrates,
the overall architecture of the active site is not optimal for
utilization of substrates larger than acetate or propionate.
alteration of val388 to ala, as seen in pcs and sa (which
utilize propionate and 2-methylpropionate, respectively)
(figure 2), transformed mt- xxxg47xxx  into an enzyme with a
slight preference for propionate over acetate (table 2). the
turnover rate of this variant was higher with acetate than
with propionate, but the decreased affinity for acetate and
increased affinity for propionate rendered the overall catalytic
efficiency better with propionate. in addition, this alteration
allowed the variant to use butyrate, unlike for the wild-type
enzyme. the val388gly mt- xxxg47xxx  variant had a reduced
affinity for acetate and propionate and a poor overall catalytic
efficiency with either substrate.
although the val388ala replacement has altered the
substrate preference of mt- xxxg47xxx  from acetate to propionate,
this enzyme variant is not an effective pcs. the s. enterica
pcs (7) shows a strong preference for propionate over
acetate, in terms of both affinity (85-fold) and catalytic
efficiency (86.5-fold). the val388ala mt- xxxg47xxx  variant has
only a slightly higher catalytic efficiency with propionate
than acetate and only 3-fold better affinity for propionate.
furthermore, this alteration decreased the catalytic efficiency
5.8-fold relative to the wild-type enzyme. although both the

using accelrys ds modeler 1.1, and the stereo image of the putative acyl substrate binding pocket was created using ds viewerpro 5.0.
the propylphosphate group was lengthened by two methylene groups to mimic binding of valerate. residues within 10 å of the valeryl
moiety are shown. ile312 is shown in purple, thr313 in magenta, val388 in red, and trp416 in blue. the propylphosphate group is shown in
aqua. (a) front and (b) side views similar to those shown in figure 1.

val388ala mt- xxxg47xxx  variant and pcs can utilize butyrate,
it is a very poor substrate for each.
pcs and sa, which utilize propionate and 2-methylpropionate, respectively, have ala in the equivalent position to
val388 of mt- xxxg47xxx .  xxxg1889xxx  and macs1 utilize longer acyl
substrates such as hexanoate and octanoate and have gly in
place of val at this position (figure 2). the results observed
with the val388ala variant suggest that reducing the size of
the side chain at this position in mt- xxxg47xxx  lengthens the
hydrophobic pocket to allow slightly longer substrates to be
accommodated. however, replacement with gly likely
introduces too much flexibility to the architecture of the
pocket, resulting in poor substrate affinity and catalytic
efficiency.
alterations at thr313 proved to be quite interesting. the
thr313val variant had a very strong affinity for acetate and
propionate relative to the wild-type enzyme (table 1). the
fact that the affinity for both of these substrates increased
by a similar degree but the substrate range was not affected
suggests that replacement of thr with the hydrophobic
residue val served to increase the overall hydrophobicity of
the pocket without greatly altering the shape or size. the
increased hydrophobicity of the pocket may also account for
the decreased catalytic rate in that it may be more difficult
for the enzyme to release the acetyl-coa product due to
stronger hydrophobic interactions.
replacement of thr313 with lys, the residue present at the
equivalent position in sa (figure 2), gave a very unexpected
result. the activity of this variant was the same in the
presence or complete absence of coa (table 4 and data not
shown). the hydroxamate assay used in these investigations

detects free activated acyl groups such as acetyl-coa, acetyl
phosphate, and acetyl-amp. wild-type mt- xxxg47xxx  has no
detectable activity in the absence of coa (data not shown),
indicating that the enzyme-bound intermediate is not detected
by this assay. the thr313lys variant not only produces an
activated acyl product detectable by the hydroxamate assay
but also produces inorganic pyrophosphate, a product of the
first step of the reaction. these results suggest that this
variant catalyzes the first step of the reaction but releases
the acetyl-adenylate intermediate, making the enzyme unable
to catalyze the second step of the reaction.
an ile312ala alteration in mt- xxxg47xxx  had the least effect
on substrate utilization of the four residues targeted in this
investigation. this replacement allowed the enzyme to utilize
butyrate; however, the affinity, turnover rate, and overall
catalytic efficiency with this substrate were low (table 1).
the variant had a reduced affinity for acetate and propionate
but the turnover rate was only reduced 2-3-fold. the effect
on overall catalytic efficiency was most noticeable for acetate
and less so for propionate. that alteration of ile312 did not
have as great an effect on substrate binding and catalysis as
observed for other alterations was not completely unexpected,
as this position is the least conserved of the four positions
investigated.
acetate is bound in acs in a similar position as observed
for phenylalanine in the  xxxd2901xxx  structure, the aryl acid 2,3dihydroxybenzoate in the dhbe structure, and 4-chlorobenzoate in the 4-chlorobenzoate:coa ligase/synthetase (cbal)
(9, 12, 16, 27), all of which are members of the adenylateforming enzyme superfamily along with firefly luciferase.
 xxxd2901xxx , dhbe, cbal, and luciferase all have gly at the

acetate binding in  xxxg51xxx 
position equivalent to trp416 of mt- xxxg47xxx  and ala or gly
at the position equivalent to val388 (27), suggesting that these
residues play a role in determining substrate utilization for
all members of the enzyme superfamily. both of these
residues are positioned in the substrate binding pocket in
each of the crystal structures. replacement of trp with gly
and val with either ala or gly thus appears to be necessary
for these other enzymes to accommodate their respectively
larger substrates. gulick et al. (27) have suggested that it is
the presence of trp instead of gly in acs and pcs that
distinguishes enzymes that utilize small acyl substrates from
other family members. our results confirm this but indicate
that the residue at the position equivalent to val388 of mtacs1 also plays an important role in distinguishing the size
of the acyl substrate.
although the substrate binding pockets for acetate, phenylalanine, 2,3-dihydroxybenzoate, and 4-chlorobenzoate
have been identified in the crystal structures of acs,  xxxd2901xxx ,
dhbe, and cbal, respectively, very little has been done
experimentally to determine the function of residues within
these pockets in determining substrate specificity. in the
 xxxd1756xxx :coa ligase 1 isozyme 4cl1 from soybean,
alteration of gly337 (the equivalent to trp416 of mt- xxxg47xxx )
to ala resulted in loss of activity of this enzyme with
 xxxd1756xxx , the highly ring-substituted cinnamate, and other
differently ring-substituted cinnamate substrates (28). furthermore, mutations in a ten-residue region immediately
surrounding gly337 also greatly reduced activity with the six
substrates tested (28). from these experimental results for
4cl1 and the structure of the related enzyme cbal, gulick
et al. suggest that the aryl-acid pocket residues ile303 and
gly305 (the cbal equivalent to trp416 of mt- xxxg47xxx ), met310
and asn311, and the four-residue connector loop in between
are all important for proper architecture of the aryl substrate
binding pocket of cbal (27).
the experimental evidence presented here clearly indicates
that trp416, val388, thr313, and ile312 form at least part of the
acetate binding site of mt- xxxg47xxx . however, these cannot
be the only residues that influence acyl substrate binding.
in the pyrobaculum aerophilum acs (pa-acs), all four of
these residues are fully conserved (figure 2), yet this enzyme
can utilize a wider range of substrates than most acss (29).
in addition to acetate and propionate, pa-acs can also
utilize butyrate and isobutyrate (2-methylpropionate) as
substrates. interestingly, pa-acs was found to have higher
activity with propionate than acetate at an acyl substrate
concentration of 5 mm. kinetic parameters were only
determined using acetate as the acyl substrate. thus, it is
not clear whether this enzyme has a higher catalytic
efficiency with acetate than propionate.
the molecular basis for the broader substrate range for
pa-acs is not clear. however, another archaeal acs from
archaeoglobus fulgidus (af-acs2) also shows a broader
substrate range and only a slight preference for acetate over
propionate (30). as for pa-acs, the four pocket residues
identified in mt- xxxg47xxx  are fully conserved in the a. fulgidus
enzyme. several residues in af-acs2 and mt- xxxg47xxx  that
reside near the acetate pocket identified herein are currently
under investigation to determine the roles of other residues
that influence acyl substrate utilization in acs and the
sacss.

biochemistry, vol. 45, no. 38, 2006 11489
the most remarkable result from this study is that
alteration of a single key residue within the acetate binding
site could have such a dramatic effect of substrate selection.
the ability of the trp416gly variant to utilize a number of
larger substrates in preference to acetate and to utilize
branched-chain acyl substrates is most likely due not only
to loss of the bulky trp side chain but also to the increased
flexibility in this region due to introduction of gly. additional changes in the active site are necessary for these
substrates to be utilized well though, as the turnover rate
suffered as the affinity for larger substrates increased. finally,
although alterations at each of these four residues influenced
substrate selection, it is clear that these four residues alone
do not define the acetate binding pocket and additional
residues are involved.
