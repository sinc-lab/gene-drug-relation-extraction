in this study, we investigated the crosstalk of  xxxg674xxx  (et-1) and platelet-derived
growth factor (pdgf) in coronary artery smooth muscle cell (smc) proliferation in the rat
cardiac allograft model.
background previous studies have suggested an independent role of et-1 and pdgf in the development
of cardiac allograft arteriosclerosis (i.e., chronic rejection).
methods
heterotopic heart transplantations were performed from dark agouti to wistar furth rats.
grafts were harvested after five days in an acute rejection model and after 60 days in a chronic
rejection model. in the in vitro part of the study, smc proliferation and migration were
quantitated, as well as messenger ribonucleic acid (mrna) levels of et-1 and pdgf ligands
and receptors after growth factor stimulation.
results
acute rejection induced both et-1 receptors in the arterial wall. on linear regression analysis
of chronically rejecting cardiac allografts, a strong correlation between intimal thickening
and immunoreactivity of et-1 and et receptors a and b (eta and etb) in the arterial
walls was observed. treatment with  xxxd358xxx , a mixed et-1 receptor antagonist,
significantly reduced the incidence and intensity of arteriosclerotic lesions in rat cardiac
allografts, as well as total intragraft eta and etb mrna expression and intimal cell
et-1 and receptor immunoreactivity. this was associated with significantly reduced
intragraft pdgf beta-receptor (pdgf-rbeta) mrna expression. in contrast, cgp
53716, a protein  xxxg2198xxx  inhibitor selective for the pdgf receptor, did not reduce
intragraft et-1, eta or etb mrna expression. in rat coronary artery smc cultures,
et-1 stimulation significantly upregulated pdgf-ralpha and -rbeta mrna expression
and augmented  xxxd292xxx –mediated smc proliferation as well as pdgf-ab– and
 xxxd292xxx –mediated smc migration.
conclusions our results suggest that the et-1/pdgf-rbeta/ xxxd292xxx  axis may operate in smc
migration and proliferation in cardiac allograft arteriosclerosis, thus explaining the marked
beneficial effects of blocking the signaling downstream of et-1 receptors. (j am coll

objectives

active  xxxg674xxx  (et-1) is a 21-amino acid peptide
proteolytically generated from its precursor preproet (1).
 xxxg674xxx  is the most potent known vasoconstrictor
released from endothelial cells (ecs) to act on the underlying vascular smooth muscle cells (smcs) (2,3). the effects
of et-1 are mediated through two g-protein– coupled
receptors—the et receptors a and b (eta and etb).
ligand binding results in activation of intracellular phospholipase c and release of calcium from sarcoplasmic
reticulum, leading to its biologic responses (1). both eta
and etb subtypes are expressed by vascular smcs and
mediate vasoconstriction (4). in ecs, etb is the predominating subtype and mediates vasodilation through release of
vasoactive factors such as  xxxd2738xxx  (5).

2001, accepted november 13, 2001.

in addition to its vasoactive functions, et-1 acts as a
growth factor for smcs (6). the proinflammatory cytokines  xxxd2374xxx  ( xxxg1170xxx ) and tumor necrosis
factor-alpha (tnf-alpha) upregulate et-1 mrna levels
in ecs (7). in vascular smcs, platelet-derived growth
factor-aa (pdgf-aa) induces production of et-1 at
protein and mrna levels (8,9). through these vasoactive
and mitogenic effects, activation of et-1 expression is
connected to many vascular disorders (10,11).
 xxxd292xxx  is the most potent mitogen for smcs in vitro
and is expressed in macrophages of intimal lesions of
ordinary atherosclerosis (12,13). pdgf-aa is a weak
mitogen for smc proliferation in vitro, but our previous
results suggest that it plays a major role in the development
of intimal lesions in a macrophage-derived cytokine microenvironment in cardiac allograft arteriosclerosis (14,15).
recent studies indicate that et-1 may also regulate smc
proliferation in arteriosclerosis, but the role of et-1 as a
direct smc mitogen remains controversial (6,16). in this
study, we investigated the interaction between et-1 and
pdgf in rat coronary artery smc cultures in vitro and in
the cardiac allograft model in vivo.

methods
heterotopic heart transplantation. inbred dark agouti
(ag-b4, rt1a) and wistar furth (ag-b2, rt1u) rat
strains (weighing 200 to 300 g) (laboratory animal center,
university of helsinki, helsinki, finland) were used for
heterotopic heart transplantations, as described (17). in the
acute rejection model, the recipients were not immunosuppressed, and the grafts were removed five days after transplantation. in the chronic rejection model, the allografts
were treated with  xxxd358xxx , 100 mg/kg body weight per
day, or vehicle by orogastric tube and  xxxd1781xxx  (csa),
2 mg/kg per day subcutaneously for the first week and
1 mg/kg per day thereafter, and the grafts were removed 60
days after transplantation. to analyze the correlation between the development of intimal thickening and et-1
ligand and receptor expression, the recipients were given
csa at a dose of either 1.0 mg/kg per day, 1.5 mg/kg per
day or 2 mg/kg per day for two weeks, followed by one week
of csa at 1 mg/kg per day. we have previously demonstrated an inverse correlation between csa levels and
intimal thickening (18).
to investigate the effects of pdgf inhibition on et-1
ligand and receptors in the chronic rejection model, the rats
received cgp 53716, 50 mg/kg per day intraperitoneally by
a single injection starting 24 h before transplantation. as
cgp 53716 interacts with csa metabolism, csa was
administrated according to blood trough levels (14). the
administration of csa, 2 mg/kg for the first week, followed
by 1.5 mg/kg, yielded blood trough levels in vehicle-treated
rats that matched those in rats treated with csa, 1 mg/kg
per day, and cgp 53716 (14).
drug regimens.  xxxd1781xxx  ( xxxd1781xxx ; novartis,
basel, switzerland) was dissolved in  xxxd3230xxx , 200 mg/ml
( xxxd1866xxx , stockholm, sweden) to a final concentration
of 1 mg/ml. whole blood csa 24-h trough levels were
determined once a week using radioimmunoassay ( xxxd1781xxx  kit; novartis).  xxxd358xxx  ( xxxd358xxx /029), an orally
active nonpeptide et antagonist (kindly provided by dr.
m. clozel, actelion ltd., allschwil, switzerland) (19), was
suspended in 5% gummi arabicum to a concentration of 25
mg/ml. cgp 53716, a protein  xxxg2198xxx  inhibitor

selective for the pdgf receptor (novartis), was dissolved in
 xxxd1896xxx  to a concentration of 200 mg/kg, diluted
1:20 with 1% tween in 0.9% nacl, and sonicated.
histologic findings. the grafts embedded in paraffin were
examined histologically after sectioning and staining with
hematoxylin-eosin and  xxxd3102xxx -fuchsin (internal elastic
lamina). the changes in intimal thickness of each vessel
were scored from 0 to 4, as previously described (14). as a
final score for intimal thickening, the mean score of epicardial arteries and intramyocardial arterioles per cross section
was given.
immunostaining. immunohistochemical analyses were
performed using the abc method (vectastain elite abc
kit, vector laboratories, burlingame, california). the following polyclonal antibodies were applied: rabbit anti–et-1
(porcine/human) serum (dilution of 1:50; peninsula laboratories inc., san carlos, california), sheep anti-rat eta
and sheep anti-rat etb (dilution of 16 ␮g/ml; u.s. biological, swampscott, massachusetts). immunoreactivity was
scored from 0 to 3, as previously described (14). specificity
control stainings included omission of primary antibody and
staining with the same immunoglobulin concentration of
species- and isotype-matched antibodies. none of these
control stains showed any immunoreactivity.
cell cultures. a rat coronary artery smc line (kindly
provided by dr. d. leszczynski, finnish center for radiation and nuclear safety, helsinki, finland), was cultured
in 10% fetal bovine serum (fbs) dulbecco’s modified
eagle medium (dmem), supplemented with 10 mmol/l
hepes, 100 iu/ml penicillin, 100 ␮g/ml streptomycin and
1% glutamine (gibco brl, rockville, maryland). for
proliferation analysis, the cells were trypsinized and seeded
on microwells in culture medium containing 10% fbs at a
concentration of 25,000 cells/ml and allowed to adhere for
24 h. after starvation in serum-free medium for 72 h,
quiescent cells were either incubated with 20 ng/ml of
pdgf-aa, -ab or -bb (upstate biotechnology inc.,
waltham, massachusetts) for 24 h or pre-incubated with
10 ng/ml of et-1 (peninsula laboratories inc.) in 0.5%
fbs dmem, supplemented with 0.1% bovine  xxxg124xxx  for 24 h and then with pdgf ligands for another 24 h.
3
h-tdr incorporation (1 ␮ci/ml) was measured during the
last 24 h of incubation. for migration analysis, transwell
culture chambers (costar, acton, massachusetts) were
coated with collagen (upstate biotechnology inc.), and
50,000 cells were seeded in the upper chamber. after 2 h,
et-1, pdgf-aa, pdgf-ab and  xxxd292xxx  were added
to the lower chamber and incubated for 24 h. filters were
fixed in methanol, stained with mayer’s hemalum and
removed. migrated cells on the lower side of the filter were
quantitated by counting cross-sectional fields with a light
microscope using ⫻400 magnification. for mrna analysis,
the cells were starved for 72 h in 0.5% fbs dmem,
supplemented with 0.1% bsa. quiescent cells were challenged with 20 ng/ml of et-1 in a serum-free medium,

reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rtpcr). relative preproet-1, eta, etb and pdgf-a,
pdgf-b, pdgf-alpha and pdgf-beta mrna transcript
levels were measured with rt-pcr after normalization
against levels of the reference gene glyceraldehyde-3phosphate dehydrogenase ( xxxg861xxx ). total rna was
extracted from fresh heart tissue samples and cell culture
samples, as described (20,21). after deoxyribonuclease
treatment, the total rna yields were estimated by spectrophotometry and confirmed by 1% agarose/tris-borateedta gel electrophoresis. reverse transcription pcr was
performed as described (22). the sense and antisense
primers for  xxxg861xxx  (accession m17701) were: 5⬘gtcttcaccaccatggagaaggct-3⬘ and 5⬘tgtagcccaggatgccctttagtg-3⬘; for

for et-ra (m60786): 5⬘-gaagtcgtccgtgggcatca-3⬘ and 5⬘-ctgtgctgctcgcccttgta-3⬘; for et-rb x57764: 5⬘-ttacaagacagccaaagact-3⬘ and 5⬘-cacgatgaggacaatgagat-3⬘; for pdgf-a (l06238): 5⬘-agaagtattgaggaagccattcc-3⬘ and 5⬘-tcacctggacctctttcaattt-3⬘; for pdgf-b (z14117): 5⬘ctgagctggacttgaagatga-3⬘ and 5⬘cactactgtctcacacttgcagg-3⬘; for pdgfalpha (z14118): 5⬘-gagaagattgtgccgctgagt3⬘ and 5⬘-cacactgaaggttccgttgaag-3⬘; and
for pdgf-beta (z14119): 5⬘-tcgtcctcaacatttcgagc-3⬘ and 5⬘-tcatagggtacatgtagggggat-3⬘. gene transcript levels for a single gene were
amplified simultaneously, and each pcr analysis was completed in triplicate. for each experiment, negative control
studies were performed using water instead of complementary
deoxyribonucleic acid (cdna) or omitting reverse transcriptase during cdna synthesis. none of these control studies
showed positive signals. the mean values of three determinations were used for the final analysis, and the normalized gene
mrna transcript levels were derived by dividing the mean
value of the gene mrna by the mean value of  xxxg861xxx  for
each sample. the results are given as optical density values,
with the control group given the numeric value of 1.

(statview program, version 4.1; abacus concepts, berkeley,
california), was used to evaluate the differences between
two groups. for multiple comparisons, the kruskal-wallis
and dunn tests were applied (medstat, astra group a/s).
in addition, linear regression analysis was applied to evaluate the possible relationship of growth factor ligand and
receptor expression to intimal thickening. a p value ⬍0.05
was regarded as statistically significant.

discussion
the results of the present study demonstrate that during the
alloimmune response, et-1 receptor activation occurs in
arterial smcs. in acutely rejecting cardiac allografts, a
significant induction of et-1 in interstitial mononuclear
inflammatory cells and eta and etb in the media cells of
coronary arteries was observed, indicating possible activation and functional change of smcs early after transplantation (23). on linear regression analysis of chronically
rejecting cardiac allografts, a strong correlation between
intimal thickening and immunoreactivity of et-1, eta
and etb in intimal cells was observed. treatment with
 xxxd358xxx , a mixed et-1 receptor antagonist, significantly
reduced the incidence and intensity of arteriosclerotic le-

sions in rat cardiac allografts, decreased total intragraft eta
and etb mrna expression and intimal cell et-1, eta
and etb immunoreactivity and also reduced pdgf-beta
mrna expression. these and previous results demonstrate
a possible functional role for et-1 in the regulation of
intimal thickening in cardiac allograft arteriosclerosis
(10,11,24,25).
 xxxg674xxx  regulates pdgf receptor expression in
smcs and augments pdgf-mediated smc proliferation and migration. the role of et-1 as a direct smc
mitogen, however, has been controversial (6,16). previous
studies suggest that et-1 is a weak mitogen for vascular
smcs, but in the presence of  xxxd292xxx , its effects are
markedly potentiated (6,26). these effects were shown to be
mediated primarily by eta and not to be attributable to
overexpression of pdgf receptors and potentiation of
pdgf-induced mapk activation (26). however, the results of the present study demonstrate that when rat
coronary artery smcs are challenged with et-1, mrna
expression of pdgf-ralpha and -rbeta is significantly
upregulated, whereas the expression of pdgf ligands
remains unchanged. on stimulation with et-1, a weak
mitogenic response comparable to that of pdgf-aa was
observed in cultured rat coronary artery smcs. prestimulation with et-1 showed a significant co-mitogenic effect
with  xxxd292xxx , whereas prestimulation did not significantly alter the responses to pdgf-aa or -ab.
 xxxg674xxx  did not enhance smc migration alone, but
the effects of pdgf-ab and -bb were potentiated with

et-1. when evaluating the results of the smc proliferation and migration studies, the concept of the isoformspecific association of both pdgf receptor subunits is key:
binding of pdgf to its receptor requires dimerization and
is restricted to a ligand-specific association of the ligand
subunits (27). for example, pdgf-aa binds only to the
alpha-alpha receptor homodimer, ab to alpha-alpha and
alpha-beta receptors and bb to all possible receptor dimers
(alpha-alpha, alpha-beta and beta-beta). however,
pdgf-ab is able to induce beta-beta receptor homodimers
(28) and does not require alpha receptors for functional
binding (29).

blocking of the et-1 pathway with  xxxd358xxx  decreases
pdgf-beta mrna expression in cardiac allografts. to
test the hypothesis that et-1 regulates smc proliferation
by induced pdgf receptor activation in vivo, the effects of
 xxxd358xxx  treatment on pdgf ligand and receptor mrna
expression were examined. the results showed that treatment with  xxxd358xxx  significantly decreased the intragraft
pdgf-rbeta mrna expression in cardiac allografts. in
contrast, treatment with the selective pdgf protein receptor  xxxg2198xxx  inhibitor cgp 53716 did not reduce
intragraft preproet-1 mrna expression. rather, the
mrna levels of eta and etb were increased during cgp

smcs were either incubated with et-1, pdgf-aa,  xxxd292xxx  or pdgf-ab for 48 h, or prestimulated with et-1 for 24 h; thereafter, pdgf-aa,

53716-treatment. as demonstrated in the in vitro part of
the study, et-1 itself is not a strong mitogen and does not
stimulate smc migration, but it augments these functions
through pdgf. thus, even though et-1 ligand and
receptor expression remains high during cgp 53716 treatment, the net effect is downregulation of arteriosclerosis, as
the key mediator, and the pdgf activation pathway is
blocked. these in vitro and in vivo results speak for the
priming function of et-1 in pdgf-mediated signaling,
suggesting intracellular crosstalk between g-protein–
coupled et receptors and protein  xxxg2198xxx  pdgf
receptors in the development of allograft arteriosclerosis.
the results also explain the clear beneficial effect of et-1
receptor antagonism, leading to reduced pdgf-rbeta expression in cardiac allograft arteriosclerosis, although et-1,
itself, is a weak mitogen for smcs.
the et-1/pdgf-rbeta/ xxxd292xxx  axis may operate in
heart allograft arteriosclerosis. in vitro studies have
shown that activation of pdgf-ralpha leads to smc
proliferation but inhibits migration, whereas activation of
pdgf-rbeta stimulates both the proliferative and migratory responses of smcs (30). although  xxxd292xxx  is a
potent mitogen for smcs in vitro, in vivo studies using rat
cardiac allografts have shown that pdgf-aa, -ralpha and
-rbeta expression in intimal cells, as well as  xxxd292xxx 
expression only in interstitial mononuclear inflammatory
cells, correlates with intimal thickening (15). blocking of

signaling downstream of pdgf receptors by cgp 53716
significantly reduced arteriosclerotic lesion formation (14).
when rat coronary smcs were stimulated with pdgf-aa
or -bb in the presence of  xxxg1170xxx  or tnf-alpha, the drug
significantly inhibited only aa-ligand–induced proliferation. this was explained by the observation that in coronary
artery smc culture,  xxxg1170xxx  and tnf-alpha specifically
upregulated pdgf-ralpha mrna expression, whereas the
expression of other pdgf ligands and receptors remained
unchanged (14).  xxxg674xxx ,  xxxg1170xxx  and tnf-alpha
can induce the production of et-1 from ecs (7), although
in our cardiac allograft model, et-1 immunoreactivity in
arterial ecs was nonexistent, and mononuclear inflammatory cells, most likely activated macrophages, demonstrated
mild et-1 immunoreactivity. in addition, preproet-1
mrna expression in smcs may be induced by pdgf-aa
(8,9). thus, synthesis of these results implies that et-1 and
pdgf produced by activated macrophages may regulate
migratory and proliferative smc responses by pdgfrbeta in intimal lesion development in rat cardiac allograft
arteriosclerosis.
conclusions. we show here that et-1 alone is a weak
mitogen for smcs, but it regulates pdgf receptor expression in smcs and augments  xxxd292xxx –mediated smc
proliferation as well as pdgf-ab– and  xxxd292xxx –
mediated smc migration. the et-1 receptor antagonist

sclerotic lesions in rat cardiac allografts, as well as intragraft
pdgf-beta mrna expression. our results suggest that the
et-1/pdgf-rbeta/ xxxd292xxx  axis may operate in smc
migration and proliferation in cardiac allograft arteriosclerosis and may explain the marked beneficial effects of
blocking the signaling downstream of et-1 receptors.
