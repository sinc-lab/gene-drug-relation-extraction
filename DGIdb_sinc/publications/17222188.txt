the cobalamin–dependent cytosolic enzyme,  xxxg1479xxx 
(ec.2.1.1.13), catalyzes the remethylation of homocysteine to  xxxd2595xxx 
using 5-methyltetrahydrofolate as the methyl donor. the products of this
remethylation –  xxxd2595xxx  and tetrahydrofolate – participate in the active
 xxxd2595xxx  and folate pathways. impaired  xxxg1479xxx  activity has
been implicated in the pathogenesis of anaemias, cancer and neurological
disorders. although the need for potent and speciﬁc inhibitors of  xxxg1479xxx  has been recognized, there is a lack of such agents. in this
study, we designed, synthesized and evaluated the inhibitory activity of a
series of substituted benzimidazoles and small benzothiadiazoles. kinetic
analysis revealed that the benzimidazoles act as competitive inhibitors of
the rat liver  xxxg1479xxx , whilst the most active benzothiadiazole
(ic50 ¼ 80 lm) exhibited characteristics of uncompetitive inhibition. a
model of the methyltetrahydrofolate-binding site of the rat liver  xxxd2595xxx 
synthase was constructed; docking experiments were designed to elucidate,
in greater detail, the binding mode and reveal structural requirements for
the design of inhibitors of  xxxg1479xxx . our results indicate that
the potency of the tested compounds is related to a planar region of the
inhibitor that can be positioned in the centre of the active site, the presence
of a nitro functional group and two or three probable hydrogen-bonding
interactions.

 xxxg1479xxx  (mets) (5-methyltetrahydrofolate1 homocysteine transmethylase) (ec.2.1.1.13) is one of
two established mammalian enzymes that utilize a biologically active cobalamin derivative [methylcobalamin
(ch3-cbl)] as a cofactor [1]. mets catalyses the transfer
of the methyl group from 5-methyltetrahydrofolate to
homocysteine via the ch3-cbl cofactor, with cycling
of cobalamin between the +1 [cbl(i)] and +3 [cbl(iii)]
valency states (fig. 1). studies on the escherichia coli
and homo sapiens cobalamin-dependent mets have
revealed that it is a large, conformationally ﬂexible protein, consisting of four functional domains arranged
in a linear manner. each one of these domains binds a

different substrate or cofactor. in detail, the n-terminal
module is the homocysteine (hcy)-binding domain; the
second domain binds 5-methyltetrahydrofolate, the third
domain binds ch3-cbl; and the fourth domain (c-terminal module) binds  xxxd3156xxx  (s- xxxd3156xxx ),
an allosteric cofactor required for reductive reactivation
[2]. x-ray crystal structures of the cobalamin-, s-adometand 5-methyltetrahydrofolate-binding sites have only
been reported for the bacterial enzyme [3–5].
the reaction products  xxxd2595xxx  and tetrahydrofolate are further metabolized through the one-carbon
 xxxd2595xxx  transmethylation and folate cycles. mets
is therefore intimately linked to important biochemical

pathways. these include the reactions of trans-sulfuration through the production of homocysteine, biological methylations of dna, lipids and proteins, and
polyamine biosynthesis through the production of
 xxxd2595xxx  and s- xxxd3156xxx  [6,7]. furthermore, mets is
the only human enzyme that metabolizes methyltetrahydrofolate to tetrahydrofolate, thereby facilitating the
recycling of this major form of folates to other bioactive folates that provide one-carbon units for purine
and pyrimidine synthesis. impaired function of mets
has been linked to megaloblastic anaemias and neurological disorders [8], atherosclerosis [7] and carcinogenesis [9,10].
although the need to develop inhibitors of mets as
drug candidates has long been recognized [11], there
are a limited number of reports on agents inhibiting
this enzyme. the anaesthetic gas n2o is possibly the
only selective inhibitor of mets reported to date, its
action mediated through the oxidation of the cobalamin cofactor [12]. other compounds that have been
shown to inhibit this enzyme are the cell-signalling
molecule  xxxd2738xxx  [13,14], chloroform and carbon
tetrachloride [15], methylmercury [16], ethanol and
acetaldehyde [17], hydrazine [18], s- xxxd3156xxx  derivatives [19] and a series of cobalamin analogues [20].
polyamines have been shown to stimulate mets
activity [21], whilst methotrexate has been shown to
indirectly inhibit the enzyme in vivo through depletion
of its substrate, 5-methyltetrahydrofolate [22].
in a new strategy for discovering speciﬁc inhibitors
of mets, drug-like, benzo-fused heterocycles that
mimic substructures of 5-methyltetrahydrofolate have
been evaluated in a cell-free system. the inhibitory
activity and mechanism of action have been probed by
kinetic studies using puriﬁed rat liver enzyme, whilst a
288

the test compounds 1a–k and 2a–c (table 1) were
designed to mimic the pteridine substructure of
5-methyltetrahydrofolate, one of the two substrates of
2 mets (fig. 1), and carry functionalities that may facilitate molecular recognition.
the synthesis of compounds 1c–k followed adaptations of known methodologies. substituted phenylenediamines were prepared by selective reduction of
nitroanilines [23] and cyclized with  xxxd2154xxx  [24] to
give the desired substituted benzimidazoles. the benzimidazoles 1a–b and the benzothiadiazoles 2a–c were
commercially available.
all the compounds were tested against highly puriﬁed rat liver mets [14] and the half-inhibitory concentrations (ic50) are presented in table 1. the
benzimidazoles 1c, 1h and 1k, and the nitrobenzothiadiazole 2b, gave ic50 values close to or below 100 lm,
with 2b being the most potent inhibitor (ic50 ¼
80 lm). from these results it was apparent that the
presence of a nitro group at the 5-position was associated with stronger inhibition (1c compared with 1d; 1h
with 1i) and this was positively associated with the
presence of the 3-methoxy group (1c compared with
1h). however, the aminobenzimidazole 1k showed a
marginally stronger inhibition than the corresponding
nitrobenzimidazole 1j. this result may indicate that
there is more than one mode of interaction with the
active site that affects the activity of more-highly substituted molecules such as 1j and 1k. furthermore, the
presence of an n-methyl group on the benzimidazole
ring (position similar to the one in the substrate
5-methyltetrahydrofolate; fig. 1) was detrimental to
the ic50 (comparing 1c with 1f and 1h with 1j).
finally, the inhibitory activity of the benzothiadiazoles
was improved by the nitro substitution (2b compared
with 2a or 2c).
to explore further the molecular mechanism of
action of those two classes of substituted benzoheterocycles, the kinetic parameters of inhibition were measured. compounds 1c and 2b were chosen as being
representative of each class as a result of their good
inhibitory activity and availability. figure 2 shows the
lineweaver–burk, dixon and cornish–bowden plots
for the uninhibited and inhibited reactions. the km
values for the uninhibited reaction were calculated to
be 25 lm for 5-methyltetrahydrofolate and 0.6 lm
for homocysteine, both results being in fair agreement

with previously published data for the pig liver enzyme
(16.8 and 2.16 lm, respectively) [25]. the lineweaver–
burk plots for the inhibited reactions showed that the
nitrobenzimidazole 1c exhibits the characteristics of
mixed inhibition (fig. 2a) (ki ¼ 26 lm), whilst the
nitrobenzothiadiazole 2b is an uncompetitive inhibitor
of mets with respect to 5-methyltetrahydrofolate
(ki ¼ 17 lm) (fig. 2b). these ﬁndings were conﬁrmed
by the dixon (fig. 2c,d) [26] and cornish–bowden
(fig. 2e,f) [27] plots for the two compounds. when
1c and 2b were assessed with homocysteine as the variable substrate, the lineweaver–burk, dixon and cornish–bowden plots indicated that both compounds
exhibited characteristics of mixed inhibition (fig. 3),
with the nitrobenzothiadiazole 2b presenting a strong
component of uncompetitive inhibition (fig. 3d). it
must also be noted that both compounds were very
weak inhibitors when assessed with respect to homocysteine, with detectable inhibition noted mainly at
high concentrations of the inhibitors (0.5 and 1 mm;
fig. 3a).
the results of these studies suggest that the two classes of substituted benzo-fused heterocycles may act by
two distinct mechanisms. the mixed inhibition exhibited by the nitrobenzimidazole 1c is a pattern usually
observed in multisubstrate enzyme-catalysed reactions
such as mets. however, the uncompetitive inhibition,
shown by the nitrobenzothiadiazole 2b, indicates that
there is no reversible link between the inhibitor and
the variable substrates. plausible rationalization

includes the possibility that the relatively small nitrobenzothiadiazole may displace the dimethylbenzimidazole side chain of the cobalamin-cofactor or that it may
act on the binding site of the mets allosteric cofactor,
s- xxxd3156xxx , both effects which could explain the
observed uncompetitive inhibition. furthermore, closely related 1,2,3-benzothiadiazoles and 1,2,4-thiazoles
act as potent electron acceptors in biological systems.
thus, 1,2,4-thiadiazoles can be used to trap cysteine
residues by mixed disulﬁde formulation [28]. alternatively, 1,2,3-benzothiazoles have been shown to inhibit
cytochrome p450 metabolites by interference with electron transport within the catalytic cycle of cytochrome
p450 [29]. details of the potential binding and electron
transfer events that may account for the uncompetitive
inhibition of mets by nitrobenzothiadiazole 2b are the
subject of continuing investigation in this laboratory.
to elucidate further the mechanism of action of the
substituted benzo-fused heterocycles, to explore the
interactions occurring at the binding site, and to
develop a tool that could assist further optimization
of inhibitors, a molecular model of the methyltetrahydrofolate-binding domain of the rat liver mets was
constructed. in the absence of a high-resolution structure of the methyltetrahydrofolate-binding site for the
mammalian enzyme, a model based on the x-ray crystal structure of the methyltetrahydrofolate corrinoid
iron-sulfur methyltransferase protein (metr) from
clostridium thermoaceticum, as determined by doukov
et al. [30], was constructed. it has been suggested that

the methyltetrahydrofolate-binding domain of mets,
and indeed of other methyltransferases, share architectural similarities [30]. we therefore constructed the rat
liver mets methyltetrahydrofolate-binding site (residues 359–639) model based on the homology of this
protein with that of metr (residues 1–262). using

obtained (fig. 4). this led to the deduction of a backbone structure that was modelled to the conserved
tim barrel fold (triose phosphate isomerase type
structure), a common feature for globular proteins that

reﬁnement of the resulting structure was performed
using minimization through application of the

residues shown in bold indicate conserved homology between the metr and mets proteins. marked with a cross (+) are the residues
that have a high degree of similarity so that although the sequence is not identical, the function of the residues is expected to remain the

docking of the substrate 5-methyltetrahydrofolate in
the model of the active site was based on the approach
followed by doukov et al. [30] to identify the interactions between the pterin cofactor and metr. this
approach was based on the assumption that the strong
structural homology of metr and the dihydropteroate
synthases (dhps) allows the prediction of interactions
between the pterin ring and metr based on the
binding of hydroxymethylpterin pyrophosphate to
dhps. following the same approach, and in order to
identify the orientation of the substrate when bound
to the active site, we superimposed the rat liver mets
model on the experimentally determined structure of
hydroxymethlypterin pyrophosphate bound to dhps
[32]. the result of this approach indicated the orientation of 5-methyltetrahydrofolate in the mets active
site. figure 5 shows the superimposed structures of
dhps and 5-methyltetrahydrofolate. the model of the
methyltetrahydrofolate-binding site of mets with one
molecule of the substrate included was further optimized using charmm, and the ligand was parameterized using partial atomic charges and other parameters
obtained from quantum mechanic modelling (hartree5 fock 6–31g* within the spartan pcpro package) of
the ligand structure. electrostatic surfaces of the methyltetrahydrofolate-binding site domain were generated
to show the size of the active site (fig. 6). the negatively charged areas may indicate the need of the inhibitor to have positively charged regions for favourable

in fig. 2) unrelated to direct binding to the methyltetrahydrofolate site.
overall, the biological evaluation and molecular
modelling studies indicate two routes for the development of the next generation of inhibitors. speciﬁcally,
the molecules need to be relatively small or not carry
bulky substituents in order to enter the active site.
they require a planar region that can be positioned in
the centre of the active site, a nitro functional group
and two or three possible hydrogen-bonding groups.
further reﬁnement of this model could assist the discovery of the next generation of inhibitors for mets.
moreover, the observed noncompetitive inhibition pattern, with respect to the methyltetrahydrofolate-binding site of mets, implies the existence of other binding
sites that may also be investigated for the development
of inhibitors, whilst the potential reactivity of the
benzothiadiazole ring opens the possibility for designing mechanism-based inhibitors. overall, this approach
may lead to the identiﬁcation of compounds with
potential therapeutic value, in particular as chemotherapeutic agents for  xxxd2595xxx -dependent cancers in
combination with  xxxd2595xxx -depleted treatments [33].
as the enzyme and its related metabolites have been
involved in many disorders, including cardiovascular
disease, neurodegenerative diseases and cancer, potent
and speciﬁc inhibitors will also be valuable tools for
deﬁning the exact role of mets in the pathophysiology
of these diseases.

enzyme purification
mets was puriﬁed from rat liver, as previously described
[14]. brieﬂy, rat liver homogenate was prepared in ice-cold
50 mm potassium phosphate buffer, ph 7.0, containing
0.1  xxxd2595xxx  nacl and protease inhibitors (14.4 mg of na-p-tosyll-lysylchloromethyl ketone, 100.32 mg phenylmethanesulfonyl ﬂuoride, 49.2 mg of  xxxd207xxx  and 10.56 mg of
27 aprotinin) and centrifuged at 1000 g for 15 min. the super28 natant was centrifuged at 27 000 g for 30 min followed by
29 a second centrifugation step at 100 000 g for 60 min to give
the cytosolic fraction. this was then run through deaecellulose (batch chromatography) equilibrated with 20 mm
sodium phosphate buffer, ph 7.2. unbound protein was ﬁltered under vacuum, whereas bound proteins (including
mets) were removed by 20 mm sodium phosphate buffer,
ph 7.2, containing 500 mm nacl. the active enzyme eluate
from this step was diluted with water to reduce the concentration of nacl. the preparation was further puriﬁed using
a q-sepharose column equilibrated with 20 mm sodium
phosphate buffer, ph 7.2, and run with a linear gradient of
0–1  xxxd2595xxx  nacl. mets was eluted at 500 mm nacl. the active
fractions were pooled, concentrated and desalted using an
amicon ultraﬁltrator ﬁtted with a 30 kda membrane. the
enzyme preparation was further puriﬁed on a hydroxyapatite column equilibrated with 20 mm potassium phosphate
buffer, ph 7.2. the enzyme was eluted using a stepwise gradient from 20 to 500 mm potassium phosphate buffer; the
active fractions eluted at 150 mm phosphate. the enzymeactive fractions were pooled, desalted and concentrated by
ultraﬁltration, as described above. the ﬁnal enzyme preparation was stored at )20 c, in 20% (v ⁄ v) glycerol.
handling of enzyme solutions was performed at low
temperature, out of direct light.

 xxxg1479xxx  assay
mets activity was determined using the assay described by
kenyon et al. [43]. brieﬂy, reactions contained 50 mm phosphate buffer (ph 7.4), 227 lm 14c-5-methyltetrahydrofolate

determination of km and vmax for 5-methyltetrahydrofolate
assays were incubated for 10 min at a ﬁxed concentration
of hcy (500 lm) and varying concentrations of 5-methyltetrahydrofolate (i.e. 0, 50, 100, 500 and 1000 lm). during
preliminary experiments, the enzyme concentration and the
incubation time were varied in order to establish conditions
for linear kinetics. the concentration of protein used was
then adjusted to ensure that the initial velocities were correctly estimated.

determination of km and vmax for homocysteine
assays were incubated for 10 min at a ﬁxed concentration
of 5-methyltetrahydrofolate (67.2 nmol per assay) and varying concentrations of hcy (i.e. 0, 0.5, 1.1, 2.2, 4.3, 6.5 and
11 lm). preliminary experiments, similar to those described
for 5-methyltetrahydrofolate, were performed with respect
to time and enzyme concentration to achieve linear kinetics.

protein assay
protein content was determined using the protein assay kit
based on the method of bradford [44]. standards and samples were assayed in triplicate, according to the manufacturer’s instructions. sample absorbances were read against
a bsa standard curve to determine protein content.

molecular model construction
protein sequences were identiﬁed using the human genome mapping project centre and the swissprot databases (http://www.hgmp.mrc.ac.uk). sequence alignment
was performed using clustalw dynamic programming.
the model was constructed using a silicon graphics
workstation with sybyl software (tripos inc.) for model
building, charmm minimization and molecular dynamics
