the human  xxxg930xxx  receptor is a member of the rhodopsinlike family of g protein-coupled receptors (gpcrs), which regulates pituitary gonadotropin secretion through  xxxd2227xxx  activation of gq/11 proteins (1). although other subtypes of gnrh
receptors have been identified in various species, there is a
single functional member of their receptor family in man but
two or three types of endogenous ligands as follows:  xxxd2227xxx 
and ii and possibly a protease-cleaved fragment 1–5 of gnrh
i (1–3). in addition, there is increasing evidence that this single
human  xxxg931xxx  (type i) is capable of coupling to different species of g proteins, such as gq/11, gs, and gi, mediating
differential physiological functions (1, 4), as has been found for
a number of other gpcrs (5). the coupling to different signaling pathways can be selectively activated by different ligands,
and this is called “agonist trafficking of receptor signals” by
kenakin (6 – 8). this concept has been supported by a number
of recent findings (9 –13). studies on the binding and signaling
characteristics of the human  xxxg931xxx  in reproductive
tissue tumor cell lines demonstrated a distinctly different pharmacology of ligand selectivity and signaling from that elucidated in pituitary gonadotropes. specifically, the human gnrh
receptor preferentially binds  xxxd2227xxx  and couples to gq/11 protein in pituitary cells to mediate activation of phospholipase c␤
and calcium mobilization. however,  xxxd2227xxx  and ii and certain
antagonists of the receptor-mediated gq/11 protein are potent
inhibitors of proliferation in reproductive tumor cell lines
through activation of gi (14, 15). we have called the phenomenon gnrh ligand-induced selective signaling (1).
we have interpreted that gnrh ligand binding to the human
 xxxg931xxx  breaks intramolecular constraint networks
that stabilize the receptor in inactive conformations, creating
new sets of inter- and intramolecular contacts that stabilize the
receptor in particular active conformations, determined by specific ligand receptor interactions. ligand induction or ligand
selection of receptor conformations then affects the downstream signaling selectivity. thus, a particular receptor conformation is selective for a specific ligand and specific signaling
pathway.
a number of intramolecular interaction networks that stabilize gpcrs in inactive conformations have been identified
through mutation-induced constitutive activations (16 –18).
these include the highly conserved l3.43 (using the nomencla-

the human  xxxg930xxx  (gnrh)
receptor is evolutionarily configured for high affinity
binding of  xxxd2227xxx  ([tyr5, xxxg234xxx ,arg8]gnrh) but at lower
affinity for gnrh ii ([his5,trp7,tyr8]gnrh).  xxxd2227xxx  is
more potent in the activation of the gq/11 protein in the
gonadotrope; however, gnrh ii is more potent in the
stimulation of apoptosis and antiproliferative effects
through activating gi protein-mediated signaling, implying that  xxxd2227xxx  and ii selectively stabilize different receptor-active conformations that preferentially couple to
different signaling pathways. receptor activation involves ligand induction or conformational selection, but
the molecular basis of the communication between ligand-binding sites and receptor allosteric sites remains
unclear. we have sought conformational coupling between receptor-ligand intermolecular interactions and
intramolecular interaction networks in the human gnrh
receptor by mutating remote residues that induce differential ligand binding affinity shifts for  xxxd2227xxx  and ii. we
have demonstrated that certain ala mutations in the intracellular segments of transmembrane domains 3
(met132), 5 (met227), 6 (phe272 and phe276), and 7 (ile322 and
tyr323) of the human  xxxg931xxx  allosterically increased ligand binding affinity for gnrh ii but had little
effect on  xxxd2227xxx  binding affinity. we examined the role of
the three amino acids that differ in these two ligands, and
we found that tyr8 in gnrh ii plays a dominant role for
the increased affinity of the receptor mutants for gnrh
ii. we propose that creation of a high affinity binding site
for gnrh ii accompanies receptor conformational
changes, i.e.“induced fit” or “conformational selection,”
mainly determined by the intermolecular interactions between tyr8 and the receptor contact residues, which can
be facilitated by disruption of particular sets of receptorstabilizing intramolecular interactions. the findings suggest that  xxxd2227xxx  and ii binding may selectively stabilize
different receptor-active conformations and therefore different ligand-induced selective signaling described previously for these ligands.

gnrh ligand-selective and receptor-active conformations

experimental procedures

site-directed mutagenesis and receptor expression—a pcr method
was used to construct various ala point mutations. mutant receptors
cloned into the pcdna i expression vector were validated by dideoxy
sequencing. wild-type and mutant receptors were transiently expressed in cos-7 cells by transfection using a bio-rad gene pulser at
230 v and 960 microfarads with 20 ␮g of dna/0.4-cm cuvette (1.5 ⫻ 107
cells; 0.7 ml). after transfection, cells were grown in dulbecco’s modified eagle’s medium (dmem) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum,
antibiotics, and 2 mm glutamine (complete dmem) in the absence or
presence of 1 ␮m concentration of in3 (a non-peptide  xxxg931xxx 
antagonist) (30). cells were washed four times for 30 min with 2%
me2so, 0.1% bsa/hepes/dmem at 37 °c after 48 h of incubation. the
cells were then continued to be incubated with complete dmem overnight (⬃18 h) and were washed again with 2% me2so, 0.1% bsa/
hepes/dmem four times for 30 min at 37 °c prior to assays.
ligand binding—radioligand binding assays were performed on
intact cells 72 h after transfection (31). transfected cells in 12-well
culture plates were washed as above and then incubated with [125ihis5-d-tyr6]gnrh (32) (100,000 cpm/well) and various concentrations
of unlabeled gnrh ligands in 0.1% bsa/hepes/dmem for 4 h at 4 °c.
nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of 1 ␮m unlabeled
 xxxd2227xxx . after incubation, the cells were washed twice with ice-cold
phosphate-buffered saline (ph 7.4) and solubilized in 0.5 ml of 0.1 m
naoh, and the radioactivity was counted by ␥-spectrometry. all experiments were performed in triplicate and repeated at least three times.
phosphatidylinositol (phi) hydrolysis—assays for ligand stimulation of inositol phosphate production were described previously (33).

transfected cells were seeded onto 12-well plates in the absence or
presence of 1 ␮m concentration of in3. after 48 h, cells were washed as
above and labeled overnight with 1 ␮ci/ml myo-d-[3h]inositol in inositol-free dmem containing 1% dialyzed fetal calf serum. before conducting phi assay, the medium was removed, and cells were washed again
as above. cells were then preincubated with 0.5 ml of buffer a (140 mm
nacl, 20 mm hepes, 8 mm glucose, 4 mm kcl, 1 mm mgcl2, 1 mm cacl2,
1 mg/ml bsa) containing 10 mm licl at 37 °c for 30 min, followed by
addition of gnrhs for an additional 30 min. this was shown to be
within the linear period of the assay. the stimulation was terminated
by the removal of the medium and addition of 10 mm  xxxd2154xxx . the
[3h]inositol phosphates were isolated from the  xxxd2154xxx  extracts
using dowex ag 1-x8 ion exchange resin, collected with 1 m ammonium
formate containing 0.1 m  xxxd2154xxx , and quantified by liquid scintillation counting. assays were carried out in triplicate. in most cases,
receptor binding assays were conducted on the same batch of transfected cells in parallel, and therefore the receptor-binding sites
were monitored.
molecular modeling—a computer model of the human  xxxg931xxx  was built on the solved structure of bovine rhodopsin (34) (protein
data bank code 1f88) using a similar method as described previously
for the m1 machr (35) with the “modeller” (36) module within the
ds modeling (version 1.1, accelrys, san diego). briefly, alignment of
the human  xxxg931xxx  sequence on the rhodopsin sequence was
performed using “align2d” within the modeller program, followed by minor manual adjustment. the most highly conserved residues, motifs, and the disulfide bridge cys114–cys196 were located at the
same place as in the rhodopsin structure. an additional experimentally
determined disulfide bond between cys14 and cys200 (37) was also
integrated into the model. the initial models were checked with threedimensional profile (38, 39), and the model with best score was selected
and then energy-minimized using conjugate and molecular dynamics
with simulated annealing employing the charmm force field (40). the
model accommodates the experimentally determined hydrogen bonds
between asp98 (2.61)-lys121 (3.32), asn53 (1.50)-asn87 (2.50)-asp319
(7.49) and between asp138 (3.49)-arg139 (3.50) (1).
materials— xxxd2227xxx  (pglu1-his2-trp3-ser4-tyr5-gly6- xxxg234xxx -arg8-pro9gly10-nh2, [tyr5, xxxg234xxx ,arg8]gnrh) and gnrh ii ([his5,trp7,tyr8]gnrh)
were purchased from sigma and bachem. [his5-d-tyr6]gnrh,
[his5]gnrh, [trp7]gnrh, and [tyr8]gnrh were synthesized in our laboratory as described previously (32, 41). deepvent polymerase was from
bio-lab. restriction endonucleases and t4 ligase were from promega.
myo-d-[3h]inositol (80 ci mmol⫺1) was from amersham biosciences. in3,
(2s)-2-[5-[2-(2-azabicyclo[2.2.2]oct-2-yl)-1,1-dimethyl-2-oxo-ethyl]-2-(3,5dimethylphenyl)-1h-indol-3-yl]-n-(2-pyridin-4-ylethyl)propan-1 xxxd2850xxx 
(30) was obtained from merck.
data analysis—binding curves were fitted to the hill equation or to
the one-site model of the binding using sigmaplot 7.0 (spss), yielding
an ic50 value. the maximum receptor-binding sites were expressed
relative to a wild-type control included in each transfection. phi doseresponse curves were fitted to a four-parameter logistic function, yielding a basal activity, a maximum response (emax), an ec50 value, and a
slope factor.
results

expression of the human gnrh mutant receptors in cos-7
cells—ala mutations of met132 (3.43), phe220 (5.47), met227
(5.54), phe276 (6.44), and ile322 (7.52) led to low (⬍5% of wild
type) or undetectable ligand binding and ip response. the f272a
(6.40) mutant gave a decreased expression level to 25% that of
the wild type, and the y323a (7.53) mutant gave an increased
expression level to 250% that of the wild type as measured by
gnrh ligand binding. following the report by conn and coworkers (30), we developed a modified method to raise receptor
expression level by preincubation of the transfected cos-7 cells
with 1 ␮m of in3, a membrane-permeant non-peptide gnrh
receptor antagonist, followed by extensive washes of the cells
with 2% me2so, which allowed the removal of in3 from the
receptor before assays. expression of the poorly expressed mutant receptors was rescued to 5–96% of the wild-type level (fig. 1,
top, and table i). most interestingly, expression of the wild-type
receptor was enhanced to 130% of the untreated wild-type level
by in3 pretreatment (fig. 1, top). homologous inhibition binding
assay showed that there was no change in affinity for [125i-his5-

ture of ballesteros and weinstein in which the position of the
most conserved amino acid in the tm domain n is designated
as n.50) in the m1 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (m1
machr) (19), the human  xxxg815xxx  (20), the ␤2-adrenergic receptor (20), and the c5a receptor (21); m6.40 in rhodopsin (22); i6.40 in m5 machr (23); and the highly conserved
f6.44 (21, 24, 25) and y7.53 in the 5ht2c receptor (26). in
contrast, none of the mutation sites that convey constitutive
activity in a large number of gpcrs induced this effect in the
 xxxg931xxx . these included mutations of phe272 (6.40) and
phe276 (6.44) in the human  xxxg931xxx  (27). however,
there was increased receptor expression of the f272l mutant
indicating a subtle conformational change of the receptor. engineering zn2⫹-binding sites among the above residues in the
m1 machr by multiple his substitutions led to a zn2⫹-dependent inhibition of ligand binding through distant allosteric effects (28). apparently, ligand binding triggers receptor conformational changes allosterically, which disrupt receptor
intramolecular constraint networks. weakening receptor intramolecular interactions would increase receptor protein flexibility and mobility that can result in an increased affinity
between ligand and receptor (29).
in the present study, we have mutated the residues of the
human  xxxg931xxx  at the equivalent positions mentioned
above in other gpcrs, in which the side chains of the amino
acids have been shown to make functionally important intramolecular interactions to alanine that delete side chains
beyond the ␤-carbon. these are met132 (3.43), phe272 (6.40),
phe276 (6.44), ile322 (7.52), and tyr323 (7.53). another two
highly gpcr-conserved residues in tm 5, phe220 (5.47) and
met227 (5.54), whose function has not been fully defined yet,
were also included in this study in order to understand their
potential function in the human  xxxg931xxx  binding and
activation. in the human  xxxg931xxx  model, phe220 is modeled close to the bottom of the gnrh ligand binding pocket,
whereas met227 is modeled toward to the side chains of met132
and phe276. here we show that the binding affinities of gnrh
i and ii at the human  xxxg931xxx  can be differentially
affected through amino acid mutations remote from the binding sites, suggesting an increased ligand-induced shift of receptor conformational equilibria, toward active conformations selective for gnrh ii.

d-tyr ]gnrh between in3 pretreated and untreated wild-type
and mutant receptors in which binding was measurable without
in3 pretreatment. all mutations had little effect on the affinity
for [his5-d-tyr6]gnrh (fig. 1, bottom).
mutations of m132a and f272a specifically increase affinity
of the human  xxxg931xxx  for gnrh ii but not gnrh
i—the binding of  xxxd2227xxx  and gnrh ii to the wild-type human
 xxxg931xxx , expressed in cos-7 cells, was characterized by
one-site binding isotherms (nh ⫽ 0.83) with ic50 at 2.75 and
29.3 nm respectively. the effect of mutations on the binding
affinity of  xxxd2227xxx  and gnrh ii is summarized in table i. the
hill coefficients were unaltered for all mutants. ala mutations
of met132, met227, phe272, and phe276 only had a marginal effect
on their affinity for  xxxd2227xxx , less than a 2-fold increase (fig. 2a
and table i), whereas f220a and y323a gave no changes in the
affinity for  xxxd2227xxx  (table i). the mutations of m227a, f276a,
i322a, and y323a had 2– 4-fold increases in affinity for gnrh
ii, whereas mutations of m132a and f272a strongly increased
affinity for gnrh ii by 12-fold (fig. 2b). in the case of i322a,
the affinity could not be measured accurately due to the extremely low expression of the mutant receptor even after in3
rescue. no significant change in the affinities for both  xxxd2227xxx 
and ii was observed for the f220a mutant, although it had a
similar reduction in receptor expression as the m132a, m227a,
and f276a mutants.

tyr8 in gnrh ii plays a dominant role for the increased
affinity of gnrh ii—there are three amino acid differences
between  xxxd2227xxx  and gnrh ii, i.e. tyr5,  xxxg234xxx , and arg8 in
 xxxd2227xxx  are replaced by his5, trp7, and tyr8 in gnrh ii. to
identify which residue in gnrh ii plays a key role in the
affinity increase for gnrh ii in the receptor mutants, we next
examined the effect of the mutations on the binding affinities of
gnrh analogues with single substitutions (his5, trp7, and
tyr8) in  xxxd2227xxx . substitution of tyr5 in the  xxxd2227xxx  with his5
led to a 3-fold increase in binding affinity of the ligand for the
wild-type human  xxxg931xxx . similar increases in affinity
were observed for f220a, f276a, and y323a mutants, whereas
the m132a, m227a, and f272a mutants exhibited a 5– 6-fold
increase in affinity for the [his5]gnrh analogue compared
with  xxxd2227xxx  binding affinity at the wild-type  xxxg931xxx 
(table ii and fig. 3a). in contrast, [trp7]gnrh exhibited a
0.87-fold decrease in the affinity for the wild-type human
 xxxg931xxx  and a similar change for the mutant receptors
(fig. 3b). most interestingly, substitution of arg8 of  xxxd2227xxx 
with tyr8 led to an 82-fold reduction in the affinity for wildtype receptor compared with  xxxd2227xxx . in contrast, mutations of
m132a and f272a increased their affinity for [tyr8]gnrh by
33- and 35-fold, respectively (fig. 3c). the mutations of m227a
in tm 5, f276a in tm 6, and y323a in tm 7 caused a small
increase in affinity about 2-fold for [tyr8]gnrh, but no change
was observed for the mutation of f220a (table ii).
effects of mutations on the gnrh ligand-elicited phi turnover— xxxd2227xxx  and ii elicit robust phi responses from cos-7 cells
transfected with the wild-type human  xxxg931xxx , with ec50
values of 0.7 and 6.7 nm, respectively, reflecting the 10-fold difference in the affinities for the human  xxxg931xxx  (table i).
the maximum responses were typically six times the basal activity. the effects of the ala mutations on the phi responses are
summarized in table i. all of the mutant receptors that gave
measurable gnrh binding were able to mediate a phi response
to  xxxd2227xxx  and ii. however, their maximum phi response and
ec50 value varied according to their expression levels. the in3
preincubation, which increased expression level of the wild-type
receptor by 130%, also increased the maximum phi responses to
the equivalent level with little effect on the ec50 values, indicating that within a limited response window of the receptor system,
there was a near-linear relationship between receptor-binding
sites and the maximum phi responses to gnrh stimulation (42).
hence, the relative maximum signaling efficacy of gnrh can be
calculated by normalization of the maximum phi responses to
the cell surface receptor-binding sites as the receptor population
is saturated, and the affinity is not an issue (43). all mutants
with reduced receptor expression levels increased gnrh signaling efficacy to phi response by 2– 8-fold. the f272a mutant,
when expressed at the wild-type level, caused 1- and 7.4-fold
decreases in the ec50 values in the  xxxd2227xxx - and ii-elicited phi
responses with the increased maximum responses at 133–150%
of the wild-type levels. a 3.6-fold reduction of the ec50 value was
observed in the gnrh ii-elicited phi response in the mutation
m132a, even though its expression was only 22% of the wild-type
level. no constitutive activation was observed in all mutant
receptors.
in contrast, ala mutation of tyr323 caused 46- and 57-fold
increases in the ec50 values for  xxxd2227xxx - and ii-elicited phi
responses, respectively, but with reduced maximum responses
to 8 –51% of the wild-type level, even though it gave 250%
expression of the wild-type level (table i).
[tyr8]gnrh-stimulated phi response was selectively examined in the f272a mutant as its expression can be rescued
to the wild-type level, thus eliminating potential effects of
variation in receptor expression on the functional response.

peptide and polypeptide ligand binding at the extracellular
surface of 7-tm receptors triggers conformational changes of
the 7-tm domains that translate into changes in intracellular
surface conformation that promotes interaction with effector
proteins (17, 44, 45). the mechanisms mediating allosteric
communications between the distant ligand-binding sites and
intracellular effector protein recognition sites in the gpcrs
have yet to be fully elucidated. an understanding of the differential effects of ligand binding on receptor conformational
change and transfer to ligand-induced selective signaling (1) is
even more challenging. reciprocal interactions and cooperativity between the ligand binding and intracellular effector domains are likely to underlie receptor ligand binding and coupling specificity. this has been evidenced by ligand-selective
signaling (46) and the recent finding of the effect of activation
of intracellular protein kinase c by phorbol 12- xxxd2681xxx  13acetate on the gnrh ligand binding selectivity of a xenopus
 xxxg931xxx  (47, 48). hence, long range interactions of receptor amino acids are important for both ligand binding and
coupling specificity, i.e. they depend not only on the direct
contact residues but also on distant residues located in other
secondary structural domains of the receptor (49). hence, delineation of the allosteric communication network between remote sites of a gpcr, which involves receptor conformational
switches and ligand binding, and effector protein coupling selectivity is a fundamentally important issue in the understanding of gpcr function and in drug development.
here we have applied ala mutagenesis of the highly conserved
gpcr residues met132 (3.43, 74% leu and 4% met), phe220 (5.47,
70% phe), met227 (5.54, 55% leu, ile, and val and 30% met),
phe272 (6.40, 84% leu, val, and ile and 1% phe), phe276 (6.44,
82% phe), ile322 (7.52, 50% leu and val and 41% ile), and tyr323
(7.53, 92%) (50) in the human  xxxg931xxx  to address this
question. replacement of individual amino acids by alanine,
which deletes the side chain beyond the ␤-carbon, normally
avoids steric interference (51) and has been successfully applied
to the m1 machr to define the role of amino acids in the 7-tm
domains (19, 35, 52). this has enabled us to identify a set of
conserved intramolecular interactions that link distant functional sites in the tertiary structure involving ligand selection of
receptor conformations in the human  xxxg931xxx .
the gnrh ligand binding and phi response were completely
abolished by the ala mutations of met132, phe220, met227,
phe276, and ile322, and the expression level of f272a was reduced to 25% of the wild-type level. the decrease in receptor

expression levels caused by the ala mutations suggests that
the side chains of these residues make intramolecular contacts
that are crucial in stabilizing  xxxg931xxx  folding. in the

human  xxxg931xxx  model, the side chains of met132 and
phe272 appear to contribute to a critical packing interaction as
in rhodopsin (34). this interaction may be extended into tm 7
by a stacking contact between the phe272 and ile322 side chains
and extended into tm 5 by van der waals contacts between the
side chains of met132, met227, and phe276 (fig. 5a). a large
decrease in the receptor expression level was also observed in
the mutations at the equivalent positions of met132 (3.43) and
phe276 (6.44) of the m1 machr (19). these residues are highly
conserved among gpcrs, and therefore the intramolecular
contacts made by these residues may represent part of the
conserved structural elements stabilizing the 7-tm receptors,
in addition to the conserved h-bond interactions made by
n1.50, d/n2.50, d3.49, w4.50, and d/n7.49 (52, 53). the conservation of the stabilizing residues has been proposed to
evolve, at least in part, from requirements for protein stability
and folding (54). disruption of the intramolecular interactions
made by the stabilizing residues through mutation may cause
misfolding of the protein and therefore increased degradation
(53). all the mutants with decreased receptor expression levels
were rescued by preincubation with the membrane permeant,
non-peptide  xxxg931xxx  antagonist, in3, acting as a pharmacological chaperone, presumably by binding and stabilizing
the mutant receptors intracellularly and allowing their transport to the cell membrane. this approach has been extensively
applied to rescue structurally unstable constitutively active
mutants in the other gpcrs (19, 55). the rescue of many
mutant receptor expressions by in3 is also suggestive of an
altered ensemble of receptor conformational states.

the presence of the intramolecular interactions made by the
side chains of met132 and phe272 and their surrounding residues met227, phe276, and ile322 was also supported by the
functional assay. normalization of the maximum phi response
with the cell surface receptor number showed that all mutants,
whose expression level was reduced, increased their maximum
signaling capability. for instance, the ala mutant of ile322,
whose receptor expression was only about 5% of the wild-type
level, gave a maximum response to  xxxd2227xxx  and ii of 38 – 44%
of the wild-type receptor. disruption of intramolecular interactions facilitates receptor conformational motion and hence increases ligand-induced receptor activation. if the disruption
causes a significant agonist-independent shift of the receptor
conformational equilibria toward an active state, this would
give rise to constitutive activity (19). however, no constitutive
activation of phi turnover was observed in any of the mutant
gnrh receptors, suggesting that the function of these residues
in the human  xxxg931xxx  may be not identical to that of
other gpcrs, in which mutations do lead to constitutive activation. the human  xxxg931xxx  may also be strongly constrained in the inactive state (27). disruption of part of the

model was derived from the crystal structure of rhodopsin and was energy-minimized using the charmm force field as
described under “experimental procedures.” a, the side chains of met132 and
phe272, viewed from the extracellular surface, form a crucial packing interaction
that may extend to residues met227,
phe276, ile322, which stabilizes receptor
folding and acts as a ligand-dependent
receptor conformational switch. b, a side

intramolecular constraint network may not be sufficient to
cause a significant agonist-independent shift of the receptor
conformational equilibria to the active state that couples to gq,
but it could nevertheless influence ligand-induced receptor conformational changes (fig. 6).
in contrast to the decreased expression levels of most ala
mutations in the human  xxxg931xxx , y323a led to a 2.5fold increase in receptor expression but resulted in poor coupling to gq/11, consistent with a previous report (56). this
suggests that tyr323 plays an important role in configuration of
the tertiary structure of the  xxxg931xxx  and receptor activation. the side chain of the equivalent residue of tyr323 (7.53)
in other gpcrs has been shown to make intramolecular contacts with a phe residue located in helix 8 of the intracellular
c-terminal tail (16). however, the human  xxxg931xxx  is
characterized by the lack of the c-terminal tail. hence, the
conformation of the human  xxxg931xxx  in this microdomain
is clearly different from other gpcrs, and its precise function
requires elucidation.
the ala mutation of met132, phe220, met227, phe272, phe276,
and tyr323 had no or only marginal effects on receptor affinity for

29802

gnrh ligand-selective and receptor-active conformations

 xxxd2227xxx . however, mutations of m132a and f272a markedly
increased affinity for gnrh ii. the increased affinity of the
mutant receptors for gnrh ii seems unlikely to be caused by an
enhanced formation of the agonist-receptor-gq/11 ternary complex, as there was little effect of the mutations on the affinity for
 xxxd2227xxx . in addition, the mutation of y323a, which is functionally uncoupled from gq/11 proteins and not responsive to the
gtp␥s shift (56), also showed a 2-fold increase in affinity for
gnrh ii. therefore, we suggest that creation of a high affinity
binding pocket for gnrh ii requires receptor conformational
changes, i.e.“induced fit” or “conformational selection” that shifts
conformational equilibria (57, 58). the ligand induction or selection of different receptor conformations is facilitated by increasing receptor structural flexibility or mobility via weakening particular sets of intramolecular interactions (59). disruption of the
intramolecular interaction made by the phe220 side chain did not
have any effect on gnrh binding affinity, indicating that this
interaction is not involved the coupling of gnrh-binding sites to
receptor conformational change.
the mutations that induce an increased receptor affinity for
gnrh ii were remote from the gnrh-binding sites (fig. 5b),
suggesting that they facilitate ligand-induced receptor conformational changes that favor gnrh ii binding, as they had only
a small effect on  xxxd2227xxx  binding, and had no effect on gnrh
antagonist binding.2 characterization of the mutant receptors
with gnrh analogues incorporating single gnrh ii amino acid
substitutions in  xxxd2227xxx  gave additional insight into the differential receptor binding and activation by  xxxd2227xxx  and ii. the
mutations that markedly increased affinity for gnrh ii also

fig. 6. a schematic showing how disruption of a set of intramolecular interactions remote from ligand binding pocket
selectively affects different ligand binding affinities. different
ligands (l1 and l2) bind with a cognate receptor via common (a/a⬘,
b/b⬘, and d/d⬘) and differential (c/c⬘ for l1 and e/e⬘ for l2) receptorligand interactions. the wild-type receptor has a high affinity binding
for l1 due to the strong interactions between c and c⬘, but it has a
lower affinity binding for l2 due to the unfavorable contacts between e
and e⬘. disruption of the intramolecular interactions between the side
chains of met and phe remote from the ligand binding pocket in the
mutant receptors does not significantly affect the intermolecular interactions between l1 and the receptor, and therefore, it has less effect on
the mutant receptor binding affinity for l1, but the disruption facilitates the intermolecular interactions (induced-fit) between l2 and the
receptor, in particular the ligand-specific interactions between e and
e⬘, and hence it selectively improves the mutant receptor binding
affinity for l2.

displayed increased affinity for [tyr8]gnrh but had little effect
on [his5]gnrh and [trp7]gnrh. ala mutation of met132 and
phe272 led to a 20 –34-fold increase in affinity for [tyr8]gnrh,
but only had a 1-fold increase for [his5[gnrh and had no
change for [trp7]gnrh. the results indicate that the mutations that induced increased receptor affinity for gnrh ii
affected the intermolecular interactions between tyr8 and cognate receptor contact residues that require receptor conformational change to facilitate interaction with the tyr8 side chain.
the cognate receptor contact residue for arg8 in  xxxd2227xxx  is the
negatively charged side chain of asp302 (7.32) of extracellular
loop 3 (ecl 3) of the receptor (60). mutation of asp302 to asn
results in a 100-fold decline in binding affinity of  xxxd2227xxx  but
no change in the lower affinity of arg8-substituted ligands,
including gnrh ii that has tyr8 (60). thus, tyr8 does not
interact with asp302 of the human  xxxg931xxx , indicating
that different amino acids in position 8 of the gnrh ligands
select different receptor contact residues that confer  xxxd2227xxx 
and ii peptide binding selectivity. the mutant receptors displayed a similar effect on the  xxxd2227xxx  binding affinity for the
5
d-6-amino acid preconfigured gnrh ligands such as [his -d6

2
tyr ]gnrh (fig. 1) and [d-ala ]gnrh, indicating that mutations of the receptor have no large effect on the  xxxd2227xxx  binding
pocket, especially the interaction between arg8 of  xxxd2227xxx  and
asp302 of ecl 3. mutations may not affect the conformation of
ecl 3 or the conformational change of the ecl 3 does not
affect the interaction between arg8 and asp302.
we suggest that tyr8 of gnrh ii may make a number of
hydrophobic interactions with the receptor different from the
interaction between arg8 of  xxxd2227xxx  and asp302 of ecl 3.
mutations facilitate receptor conformational changes that may
bring tyr8-binding residues into more accessible positions or
allow an improved ligand-receptor induced fit for tyr8, which
gives rise to an increased binding affinity for tyr8-containing
ligands. a schematic of how mutations remote from the ligand
binding pocket might affect ligand binding affinity of  xxxd2227xxx 
and ii differentially is shown in fig. 6.
our identification of tm domain mutants that increase
gnrh ii and [tyr8]gnrh binding affinity by an order of magnitude suggests that disruption of interactions between these
tm residues allows transition to a receptor conformation with
preferential binding of gnrh analogues with tyr8. the different gnrh ligand binding, in particular the different intermolecular interactions between residue 8 and the receptor contact
residues, may induce different receptor-active conformations
with distinct functional abilities. the flatter dose-response
curve of [tyr8]gnrh also indicates that sequential or differential interactions of tyr8 with multiple receptor contact residues
stabilize a series of different receptor conformations with distinct signaling ability. a recent study (61) has shown that even
a single small organic ligand such as norepinephrine can stabilize a succession of conformational states with differential
intracellular effector protein coupling via different intermolecular contacts between receptor and structural determinants of
the agonist.
in summary, the differential binding of  xxxd2227xxx  and ii to the
human  xxxg931xxx  may selectively stabilize or induce different receptor-active conformations. distinct chemical moieties at position 8 of gnrh analogues confer different ligand
induction or selection of receptor conformations, and therefore,
the ligand binding affinity can be manipulated differentially by
mutation of the residues located at the receptor allosteric sites.
the side chains of met132 and phe272 form crucial packing
interactions that control receptor conformational motion or
equilibria and are involved in ligand-induced switching of different receptor conformations through selective binding affin-
