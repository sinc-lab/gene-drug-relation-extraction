induction of  xxxg575xxx  is a nonspecific biomarker of  xxxg105xxx  activation: results of large scale screening of pharmaceuticals and tox...  expression of  xxxg575xxx  and its related enzyme activity have long been used as a biomarker for  xxxg105xxx  (ahr) activation and a warning of dioxin-like toxicity. as a result, induction of  xxxg575xxx  by pharmaceutical drug candidates or environmental contaminants raises significant concern in risk assessment. the current study evaluates the specificity of  xxxg575xxx  induction as a marker for ahr affinity and activation and provides context to assess the relevancy of ahr activation to risk assessment. in vivo experiments examined the expression of  xxxg575xxx  and other ahr-regulated genes in liver, kidney, and heart in response to 596 compounds. from this data set, a subset of 147 compounds was then evaluated for their ability to activate or bind to the ahr using a combination of gel shift, reporter gene, and competitive receptor binding assays. whereas in vivo  xxxg575xxx  mrna expression is a sensitive marker for ahr activation, it lacks specificity, because 81 (59%) of 137 compounds were found to significantly induce  xxxg575xxx  in vivo but were not verified to bind or activate the ahr in vitro. combining in vivo and in vitro findings, we identified nine ahr agonists, six of which are marketed therapeutics and have been approved by the u.s. food and drug administration, including  xxxd2450xxx ,  xxxd2143xxx , and  xxxd2728xxx . these drugs do not produce dioxin-like toxicity in rats or in humans. these data demonstrate that induction of  xxxg575xxx  is a nonspecific biomarker of direct ahr affinity and activation and lend further support to the hypothesis that  xxxg575xxx  induction and/or ahr activation is not synonymous with dioxin-like toxicity.
