the effects of nicotine

and dimethyiphenylpiperazinium
(dmpp) on resting and stimuiatioll-evoked
release of [“hiand neuro-effector neurons of the iieai longitudinai muscle and the
responses of the smooth muscle to nicotinic agonists were studied. (-)-nicotine was 15 times more effective than ( + )-nicotine in
releasing ach. since tetrodotoxin f! b*mj completely antagonized the effect of nicotinic agonists, the site of action of the
nicotinic agonists studied was on the somatodcndritic nicotinic receptors. the electrical field stimulation-evoked reiease was not
affected by nicotinic agonists and antagonists, indicating that the axon terminals of cholinergic interneurons are not equipped
with nicotinic receptors. this preparation proved to be useful to study the effect of nicotinic agonists on somatodendritic
receptors, to determine the affinity constants of nicotinic antagonists, and to characterize these receptors. the rank order of
antagonists was d-tubocurarinc =  xxxd2550xxx  >  xxxd2959xxx  > pancuronium > vecuronium > hexamethonium; the apparent
affinity constants (k,) were 1.15, 1.55, 3.06, 3.98, 13.59 and 32.88 fm, respectively. n-bungarotoxin had no antagonistic activity
at all. this fmding indicates that nicotine and the cndogenous ligand ach act via a postsynaptic, somatodendritic nicotinic
receptor that is pharmacologically similar to those located on the axon terminals of sympathetic neurons or in ganglions, but is
dissimilar to those located at the postsynaptic site of the neuromuscular junction.

1. introduction

it is generally accepted that nicotlnic receptors located postsynaptically on effector celis play a role in
signal transmission at the neuromuscular junction and
at the interneuronal synapse. recently, evidence was
obtained that nicotinic receptors located on axon terminals are involved in the modulation of transnlitter
release. in the central nervous system, it was found
that nicotinic receptor stimulation enhances the release of acetylcholine (achi from the cortex (chiou et
al., 1970; rowe11 and winkler, 1984) and that of noradrenaline (hall and turner, 1972) and serotonin q-lery
et al., 1977) from the hippocampus, and that it increases the resting release of dopamine from both
striatal synaptosomal (de belleroche and bradford.

acetylcholinc release; intestinal contraction

(goodman, 1974; westfall, 1974; giorguieff et al.,
19761. in the peripheral ne~ous system, nicotinic receptor stimulation facilitates the stimulated reiease of
ach from phrenic nerve terminals in the diaphragm
(we&es et al., 1986; vizi et al., 1987; vizi and somogyi, 1989) and the release of noradrenaline from the
pu!monaty artery (su and bevan, 1970) and vas deferens (todorov et al., 1991). it has also been suggested
that nicotinic receptors located pre- and postsynaptitally are heterogeneous and that the different effects
of nicotine may be mediated via these receptors (vizi
et al., 1987; freund et al., 1990).
several attempts have been made to characterize
nicotinic receptors in different localization ~wonnacott
et al., 19891, using radioligand binding techniques. the
disadvantage of this method is that it cannot determine
the precise localization of the receptor. by using a
pharmacological approach and measuring fractional release of a transmitter from axon terminals, presynapticalty localized receptors can be characterized. as the
release of ach from cholinergic interneurons and
neuro-effec~or neurons is not subject to modulation by

nicotinic receptors localized on the axon terminals, and
as the stimulation of somatodendritic nicotinic receptors results in the release of ach from interneurons
and neuro-effector neurons of the ileal longitudinal
muscle with the auerbach plexus attached (paton and
vizi. 1969). this preparation seems suitable for characterizing the somatodendritic nicotinic receptors located
on the cholinergic interneurons (vizi. 1973; dzieniszewski and kilbinger, 1978) and for studying the effect
of nicotine and nicotinic agonists.

muscle strips with

plexus attached

guinea-pigs of either sex weighing 200-300 g were
killed by a blow on the head. and ileal longitudinal
muscle strip preparations, with myenteric piexus attached. were prepared as described by paton and vizi
(1969).
2.2. radioassay of [-‘hiach release
experiments were carried out at 37°c in modified
krebs solution containing (mm) nacl 118, kc1 4.7,
caci, 2.5, kh, po, 1.2, mgso, 1.2, nahco, 25 and
glucose 12.5 ( xxxd2177xxx ), continuously saturated with carbogen gas (95% 0, + 5% co,). longitudinal muscle
strips of the guinea-pig ilem were incubated for 45 min
in 3-mi organ baths in the presence of 4 pci/ml
[methyl- ‘hicholine. during incubation, the preparation was stimulated continuous!y with supramaximal
impulses of 1.0 ms duration at 1 hz. after the incubation, the strips were mounted in other organ baths of 3
ml inner volume that contained two platinium electrodes, one at the top and the other at the bottom of
the bath, and superfused with krebs solution at a
constant t-ate of 1.0 ml/min by means of a peristaltic
pump. the perfusing solution contained 10 pm  xxxd2264xxx  to inhibit the reuptake of [ “hicholine originating from the hydrolysis of [“h]ach (somogyi and
szerb, lr)72). after the first 60 min (preperfusion), 3-ml
samples of effluent were collected. during the collcction of the 3rd and the 14th samples, the muscle strips
were stimulated (s, and s,) for 3 min with square-wave
impulses of 1 ms duration at 2 hz (360 stimuli).
electrical field stimulation leads to ach release
from nerve terminais in different tissue preparations.
high-performance liquid chromatography (potter et al.,
1986) and biochemical separation of labelled choline
from ach (vizi et al.. 1984) indicated that it is mainly
i3hlach that is responsible for the radioactivity released by field stimulation of longitudinal strips and
cortical slices prelabclled with [‘h]eholine. we there-

fore assumed that the radioactivity released by stimulation represented [“hlach.
the radioactivity of the samples is expressed in
terms of disintegrations per gram wet weight of tissue
@q/g). the quantity of radioactivity released in response to stimulation was dependent upon the amount
of radioactivity accumulated by the neurons of the
myenteric plexus. to normalize the quantity of radioactivity released, the release of ach is expressed as
a percentage of the total available radioactivity present
in the tissue at the onset of stimulation. therefore, at
the end of each experiment the radioactive content of
the strips was determined. the tissues were homogenized in 1 ml of trichloroacetic acid (10%). aliquots of
the perfusate samples and the supernatants of the
tissue homogenates were added to a scintillation cocktail containing dioxane and radioactivity was counted
by liquid-scintillation spectrometry.
the increase in the fractional release caused by
stimulation was calculated by subtracting the basal
tritium outflow from the radioactivity released during
stimulation. the release of ach evoked by the second
train of electrical stimuli (s,) was subjected to the
modulatory effect of the added drug. drugs were applied 15 min before, or to prevent receptor desensitization immediately before the second stimulation and
maintained until the end of the experiments. the
amount of transmitter released by s, served as control;
the presynaptic modulatory effect of drugs on ach
release is expressed as the ratio of s, over s,.
when the ach-releasing effect of (-)-nicotine or
dimethylphenylpiperazmmm
(dmpp) was studied, the
tissue was exposed to the agonists for 9 min, and the
release above the resting values, as calculated by interpolation, during this period was taken into account.
2.3. recording of the contractions of the strips
isometric contractions evoked by single doses of
nicotinic agonists were recorded. dose-response curves
were made and repeated in the presence of single
doses of nicotinic antagonists. dose ratios were calculated from the ed,,, values of the agonists in the
presence and in the absence of an antagonist. antagonist affinity is expressed as the apparent dissociation
constant (ku) calculated from the equation of gaddum (1937): k, = [a]/(dr - 11, where [a] is the concentration of the antagonist and dr is the agonist dose
ratio produced by the antagonist.
2.4. statistical analysis
all data in the text are expressed as means f s.e.
the statistical significance of the results was determined with an analysis of variance followed by dunn’s
test; p < 0.05 was considered significant.

from those obtained in the absence of agonists or

affected by nicotinic receptor antagonists when the

~oilcentration of ach at the presynaptic cholinoceptor

since the subsequent increase in ach release from
cholinergic interneurons and neuro-effector
neurons
was great enough to produce smooth muscle contraction, which could be recorded isometrically, the longitudinal muscle strip with auerbach plexus attached is a
suitable preparation for studying the effect of nicotinic
agonists that are able to stimulate the somatodendritic
part of the cholinergic neuron (day and vane. 1963;
vizi, 1973). like nicotine, dmpp evoked concemration-dependent contractions of the strips. i’he ed5,,
values for (-)-nicotine, dmpp and ( +)-nicotine were
5.84 k 0.94 fm (n = 14), 2.96 f 0.34 pm (n = 11) and
360.0 f 16.5 pm (n = 6), respectively.
if the exposure time was longer than 10 s, the
responses to nicotine or to other agonists were not
reproducible with repeated administration within 10
min. therefore, the exposure time to agonists was kept
short (10 s) in order to avoid desensitization. (-)-nicotine evoked contractions of the guinea-pig ileum longitudinal muscle strip preparation in a concentration-dependent manner; ( + )-nicotine was much less effective.
tetrodotoxin (0.5 pm) or atropine (1 pm) inhibited
the contractions evoked by (-)-nicotine.
different nicotinic receptor antagonists, hexamethonium,  xxxd2550xxx ,  xxxd3456xxx , and some muscle relaxants antagonized the contractile effect of nicotme and dmpf. a-bungarotoxin in concentrations as
high as 10 pg/ml had no effect. their affinity constants against (-)-nicotine and dmpp are shown in
table 3.  xxxd3456xxx  was found to be the most
effective drug.

4. discussion
we studied the effect of nicotinic receptor agonists
and antagonists on both the basal and electrically
evoked release of ach from cholinergic interneurons
and ‘pre-effector’ fibres of guinea-pig ileal longitudinal
muscle strip preparations (paton et al., 1971). as the
release of ach from neurons of extrinsic origin is
negligible (paton et al., 19711, the release of ach in
response to axonal or somatodendritic stimulation originates from axon terminals of cholinergic interneurons
and pre-effector fibres. since there is no morphological
or functional evidence that there are differences between cholinergic interneurons and pre-effector fibres
in the auerbach plexus, this preparation is often used
for studying the effect of nicotinic receptor agonists
and antagonists (day and vane, 1963; paton et al.,
1971; vizi, 1973; dzieniszewski and kilbinger, 1978).
nicotinic receptor agonists, such as (-)-nicotine and
dmpp enhanced the basal release of ach. (-&nicotine m’x about 15 times more effective than (+ i-nicotine in releasing ach. the release evoked by field
stimulation, i.e. axonal stimulation, was not affected by
nicotinic agonists and antagonists. since the axon terminals of the auerbach plexus are not equipped with
nicotinic receptors (table 21, the guinea-pig ileal longitudinal muscle strip with auerbach plexus attached is
an ideal preparation for studying the effect of compounds on somatodendritic nicotinic receptors present
on the cell body of cholinergic interneurons and pre-effector fibres (vizi, 1973; dzieniszewski and kilbinger,
1978).
tetrodotoxin (1 pm) completely prevented the effect of dmpp and nicotine on ach release (fig. 1).
these findings indicate that the release of ach and
the subsequent contraction of smooth muscle in response to nicotinic receptor stimulation is due to neuronal activity, and that the site of the effect of nicotinic
receptor agonists and antagonists is on the cell body
and/or on the dendrites, i.e. on somatodendritic nicotinic receptors. we therefore used this preparation to
characterize somatodendritic nicotinic receptors by estimating the apparent affinity constants of antagonists.
the rank order of the constants,  xxxd3456xxx  =
 xxxd2550xxx  > pancuronium > hexamethonium is in
excellent agreement with that obtained in ganglionic
nicotinic receptors (bowman and webb, 1972).
when nicotine was added at a high concentration
and for a longer period of time (more than 10 s), the
contraction was not reproducible. this indicates that
there was rapid desensitization to the effect of dmpp
or (-)-nicotine.
although lu-bungarotoxin (3 pg/ml) failed to prevent the effect of nicotinic receptor stimulation by
dmpp on ach release from the auerbach plexus
(table i!. other nicotinic receptor antagonists were

301

effective, in the order of  xxxd3456xxx  =  xxxd2550xxx  > hexamethonium > cu-bungarotoxin, that hexamethonium prevents the effect of dmpp on ach
release has already been shown by dzieniszewski and
kilbinger (1978). the lack of effect of a-bungarotoxin
is of particular interest in view of the number of
studies that describe its binding to nicotinic receptors
in the cns (clarke et al., 1985). in agreement with our
finding this toxin does not antagonize the action of
nicotine or ach on ganglionic preparations (brown
and fumagalli, 1977).  xxxd3456xxx  at a concentration as low as 10 pm significantly reduced the release
of ach evoked by dmpp. hexamethonium (100 pm)
also reduced the effect of dmpp. since e-bungarotoxin has been used as a specific cholinergic probe in
skeletal muscle and in the electric organ of the tarpedo culifornica, bur data support the hypothesis that
the actions of nicotine on the cell body (dendrites) of
cholinergic interneurons and pre-effector fibres in the
auerbach plexus are mediated via receptors similar to
those present on sympathetic ganglions, but completeljl
different from those located on striated muscle and in
the ca1 region of the hippocampus (freund et al.,
1990). ach release from cholinergic axon terminals in
the auerbach plexus may result from stimulation of
somatodendritic nicotinic receptor, which exist in many
areas of the central and peripheral nervous system,
thereby producing excitatory potentials (rovira et al.,
1983; rowell, 1987).
the finding that, in the somatodendritic region,
nicotine can be antagonized by  xxxd3456xxx , hexamethonium and  xxxd2550xxx , but not by ~-bungar~
toxin, suggests that nicotine and of course the endogenous ligand ach act via a nicotinic receptor with a
pharmacological profile like that of a neuromuscular
receptor or like that of receptors present in the hippacampus, but which is also similar to that of receptors
located on the axon terminals of sympathetic neurons
{todorov et al., 1991) and in ganglia.
our data also suggest that nicotine, by stimulation
of somatodendritic nicotinic receptors of auerbach’s
plexus, is able to enhance intestinal movement, a phenomenon observed by early morning smokers.
