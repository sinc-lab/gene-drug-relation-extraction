abstract
although metabolites and energy balance have long been known to play roles in the regulation of food intake, the potential role of fatty
acid metabolism in this process has been considered only recently.  xxxg765xxx  (fas) catalyzes the condensation of acetyl-coa and
malonyl-coa to generate long-chain  xxxd2154xxx  in the cytoplasm, while the breakdown of  xxxd2154xxx  (h-oxidation) occurs in mitochondria
and is regulated by carnitine palmitoyltransferase-1 (cpt-1), the rate-limiting step for the entry of  xxxd2154xxx  into the mitochondria. inhibition
of fas using  xxxd463xxx  or synthetic fas inhibitors such as c75 reduces food intake and induces profound reversible weight loss. subsequent
studies reveal that c75 also stimulates cpt-1 and increases h-oxidation. hypotheses as to the mechanisms by which c75 and  xxxd463xxx 
mediate their effects have been proposed. centrally, these compounds alter the expression profiles of feeding-related neuropeptides, often
inhibiting the expression of orexigenic peptides. whether through centrally mediated or peripheral mechanisms, c75 also increases energy
consumption, which contributes to weight loss. in vitro and in vivo studies demonstrate that at least part of c75’s effects is mediated by
modulation of amp-activated protein kinase (ampk), a known peripheral energy-sensing kinase. collectively, these data suggest a role for
fatty acid metabolism in the perception and regulation of energy balance.

1. introduction
obesity is a global health issue, and affects individuals
of all ages in both industrialized and emerging nations [1].
obesity may be viewed as the dysregulation of two
physiological functions, appetite regulation and energy
metabolism, which combine to create disordered energy
balance [2,3]. the central nervous system (cns) serves a
critical role in the evaluation of energy status, as the
hypothalamus and other regions in the brain integrate
signals from the periphery and other brain areas to regulate
feeding behavior [4 –7]. it has long been recognized that
cells in these brain regions register the concentrations of
nutrients, such as glucose, to ‘‘sense’’ energy status [8].

only recently has it been appreciated that the hypothalamus may monitor fatty acid metabolism as part of its
energy-sensing schema [9 – 12]. while this hypothesis
awaits further investigation, it has been shown by a
number of laboratories that modulation of fatty acid
metabolism may be exploited to inhibit food intake
([9,11– 18]). the present contribution reviews the potential
mechanisms by which alterations in fatty acid biosynthesis
or metabolism may influence food intake and energy
production.

2. fatty acid metabolism:  xxxg765xxx  and
carnitine palmitoyltransferase-1
in normal lipogenic tissues, such as liver and adipose,
the  xxxd2833xxx  facilitates the storage of energy
surplus as triglycerides. these triglycerides can later be
oxidized to provide energy during times of energy
deficiency.  xxxg765xxx  (fas) is a lipogenic

26

g.v. ronnett et al. / physiology & behavior 85 (2005) 25 – 35

enzyme in this pathway that catalyzes the de novo
synthesis of long-chain  xxxd2154xxx  in the cytosol.
mammalian fas is the product of a single non-duplicated
gene that generates a ¨250 kda polypeptide chain, which
is modified post-translationally by the addition of a
phosphopantotheine group [19]. fas is active as a
homodimer [19]. this enzyme performs a complex
seven-step reaction that involves the nadph-dependent
synthesis of the 16-carbon saturated free fatty acid
palmitate through the condensation of acetyl-coa and
malonyl-coa [20]. malonyl-coa, the main substrate of
fas, is synthesized from acetyl-coa by acetyl-coa
carboxylase (acc) in an atp-dependent reaction, and is
degraded back to acetyl-coa by malonyl-coa decarboxylase (mcd), which also requires atp. the h-ketoacyl
synthase moiety of fas is responsible for the condensation
of the three-carbon malonyl-coa and the two-carbon
acetyl-coa, releasing co2 in the process. the phosphopantotheine group tethers the growing fatty acyl chain as it
proceeds through subsequent reduction and dehydration
steps. this series of steps is repeated seven times, after
which the fatty acyl chain is hydrolyzed from the enzyme
to yield one palmitate. the production of one palmitate
costs the cell 7 atp and 14 nadph. while fas and acc
are both regulated transcriptionally, it is acc that is
regulated rapidly during times of energy fluctuation by
phosphorylation; citrate enhances its activity [21], while
long-chain acyl-coa’s, either generated by de novo synthesis or of dietary origin, competitively inhibit acc [22].
although previous studies [23] suggested that although
fas is expressed in the brain, it was thought to localize
predominantly to non-neuronal cells. immunohistochemical studies done by our group demonstrated that fas was
expressed predominantly in neurons in many regions of
the brain, along with other enzymes in the fatty acid
pathway, including acc and mcd [9]. fas displayed a
similar distribution in human hypothalamus. in lipogenic
tissues in the periphery, fas activity is regulated by
transcriptional control, mainly in response to diet, glucose,
thyroxine and srebp1c [24]. within 24 h of starvation,
fas message in liver is highly reduced, as is its protein
expression [9]. this is not the case in brain; fas mrna
and protein are essentially unaffected by 24 h of starvation
[9]. these data suggested that fas serves a different
function in the brain from its energy storage role in the
periphery.
fatty acid degradation occurs in the mitochondria
through the process of h-oxidation. carnitine palmitoyltransferase-1 (cpt-1) is the rate-limiting step for the entry
of  xxxd2154xxx  into the mitochondria [25 – 27]. aside from its
role as a substrate for fas, malonyl-coa is a competitive
inhibitor of cpt-1. when energy is surfeit and the rate of
fatty acid synthesis is high, high levels of malonyl-coa
prevent the oxidation of newly synthesized  xxxd2154xxx  by
inhibiting cpt-1. alternatively, when acetyl-coa levels are
reduced or when acc activity is diminished and malonyl-

coa levels fall, cpt-1 is activated. cpt-1 activity is
measured using permeabilized cells or isolated mitochondria
[28 – 30]. these studies have revealed that the regulation of
cpt-1 is complex and involves membrane interactions.
as with other metabolic pathways, enzymes within the
 xxxd2833xxx  must shift from anabolic to catabolic
states in response to changes in energy availability. hence,
fas and cpt-1 function at a metabolic crossroads between
energy storage (anabolism) and consumption of stored
energy (catabolism), and as such, activity through the fatty
acid metabolic pathway reflects the energetic state of the cell
(fig. 1).

3.  xxxd463xxx  and c75: tools for exploring the roles of
fas and cpt-1 in feeding and energy balance
interest in the role of fas in feeding and energy balance
originated in the field of cancer biology [31]. the
observation by kuhajda et al. that many human cancers
express high levels of fas [32 –34] raised the possibility
that inhibition of fas might offer a therapeutic approach in
cancer treatment. the first compound to be studied was
 xxxd463xxx  [31].  xxxd463xxx  ([2s,3r]2,3-epoxy-4-oxo7e,10e-dodecadienamide) is a natural antibiotic product
of the fungus cephalosporium ceruleans and a broadspectrum fas inhibitor [35,36]. it was the first reagent used
for in vivo studies, despite its limited solubility in aqueous
solutions. while  xxxd463xxx  induced apoptosis in cancer cells,
it did not affect non-transformed cells. however, the doselimiting ‘‘toxicity’’ was weight loss.  xxxd463xxx  treatment has
since been shown to induce profound and reversible dosedependent weight loss in lean [37] and ob/ob mice [38].
however, in some studies,  xxxd463xxx  has no significant
effect on food intake and the expression of feeding-related
neuropeptides in lean mice [39,40]. strain differences
between mice may influence the response to  xxxd463xxx .
aside from solubility issues,  xxxd463xxx  has also been
reported to interfere with protein acylation [41], which
may be due to its highly reactive epoxide group.
to investigate the weight loss caused by fas inhibition,
it was decided to create synthetic fas inhibitors, the
strategy was to design compounds that resembled malonylcoa, the natural substrate for fas [42]. of the seven
enzyme activities on fas, the h-ketoacyl synthase that
covalently joins acetate and malonate together is unique to
fas. this h-ketoacyl synthase moiety was therefore
chosen for the design of several families of inhibitors
[31,33,42]. indeed, c75, an a-methylene-g-butyrolactone,
interferes with the binding of malonyl-coa to the active
site of fas. while malonyl-coa forms a covalent adduct
with fas via the pantotheine arm, more recent inhibitors
have been designed which do not appear to bind
covalently, making them more acceptable compounds for
potential drug development (townsend and mcfadden,
personal communication).

4. the central effects of alterations in fatty acid
metabolism on feeding and body weight
since the initial observations in the kuhajda and ronnett
laboratories [37], other investigators have explored the
effects of altering fatty acid metabolism on food intake
[10,14,16,38,39,43 – 45]. while the effect is striking, several
hypotheses that appear to conflict have been proposed to
explain the mechanisms of these effects on food intake.
hypotheses differ as to the roles of alterations in fas and
cpt-1 activities, and malonyl-coa, energy (atp) and
nadph levels in mediating changes in food intake and
body weight.
c75 was initially designed as a fas inhibitor [46], and
similar to  xxxd463xxx , reduced food intake and caused
significant weight loss when given peripherally (intraperitoneally, i.p.) or centrally (intracerebroventricularly,
i.c.v.) at a hundredth of the peripheral dose, suggesting that
at least part of the effect of c75 was mediated centrally [13].
the anorexia caused by c75 in lean and ob/ob mice leading
to weight loss was associated with a reduction of orexigenic
neuropeptide npy message in the hypothalamus compared
to npy levels found in fasted animals [13]. by double
labeling in situ hybridization, fas and npy were found to
co-localize to a subset of neurons with the arcuate nucleus,
suggesting that c75 could be acting in a cell-autonomous
manner to affect npy expression [9]. an effect of c75 on
the expression levels of npy as well as on the expression of
other neuropeptides has been shown by other groups
[12,14,15]. in two of our recent studies that utilized dietinduced obese (dio) mice that had received chronic
treatment with c75 (i.p.), weight loss was accompanied
by an increase in cocaine and amphetamine-related transcript (cart) expression [18,47]. taken together, these
data suggested that c75 could act centrally to alter feeding
and initiated a number of further experiments by us and
others.
although behavior was not apparently affected by the
doses used in the initial studies, the effect of c75 on feeding
could have been due to malaise. to assess this possibility
formally, we determined whether c75 produced a conditioned taste aversion [9]. c75 administration i.p. had no
effect on saccharin preference relative to vehicle control.
thus, c75 did not appear to reduce food intake secondary to
the production of illness or malaise. these results are in
contrast to other studies that demonstrated an aversive
response to peripherally administered c75, although not to
centrally administered compound [16]. more recent studies
indicate that chemical impurities in some preparations of
c75 can contribute to sickness behavior, but the volume and
perhaps ph in which c75 is administered i.p. are major
factors in producing a sickness response (kuhajda and
thupari, personal communication). our studies have always
used minimal injection volumes and avoided this issue.
many regions of the brain contribute to the regulation of
food intake [6,48]. we [49] and others [44] have surveyed

27

the areas that c75 may influence by examining the effect of
c75 on c-fos-immunoreactivity. within several hours, c75
treatment caused a striking and specific increase in the
number of c-fos-immunoreactive cells in hindbrain feedingrelated nuclei as well as in the paraventricular nucleus
(pvn), lateral aspects of the arcuate nucleus (arc) and the
central amygdala. in contrast, c75 prevented the normal 24
h fasting-induced increases in c-fos-immunoreactivity in
the medial arc and three of its targets: lateral magnocellular pvn, lateral hypothalamus and dorsomedial hypothalamus. compared to c75,  xxxd463xxx  increased c-fosimmunoreactivity in pomc-expressing neurons even
though it similarly increased c-fos-immunoreactivity in
the lateral peri-arc and decreased fasting-induced c-fosimmunoreactivity in medial arc [50]. one group has
suggested that c75 is a non-specific neuronal activator,
based upon in vitro assays [51]. the reproducible and highly
specific changes in c-fos expression in vivo in regions
related to feeding behavior strongly argue against this
conclusion. taken together, these studies utilizing c75 and
 xxxd463xxx  suggested that hypothalamic mechanisms, specifically alterations in the expression of hypothalamic peptides
that influence food intake, could mediate part of the
anorectic responses to c75 and  xxxd463xxx .
the mechanism by which neuropeptide expression is
modulated was investigated. several pieces of evidence
supported our initial hypothesis that hypothalamic malonylcoa (which was hypothesized to increase with fas
inhibition upon c75 administration) was the metabolic
mediator that regulated feeding [52]. this was a logical
speculation, as malonyl-coa is a key regulator of fatty acid
oxidation in peripheral tissues such as muscle [25,26,53].
fas inhibition would increase malonyl-coa levels and shut
down cpt-1 activity. furthermore, tofa, an inhibitor of
acc [54] that decreases malonyl-coa levels, interfered
with c75’s effects. it was reasonable to propose that longchain fatty acyl-coa’s that accumulated due to decreased
fatty acid oxidation could signal increased nutrient availability and decrease food intake. in study using inhibitors of
cpt-1 in the hypothalamus [10], the inhibition of the
hypothalamic cpt-1 resulted in reduced food intake.
however, it was not demonstrated that cpt-1 inhibition
had any effect on body weight, suggesting that other actions
might contribute to c75’s effects.
the other effects of c75 were revealed in subsequent
studies. if c75 elevated malonyl-coa levels, thereby
shutting down fatty acid oxidation, one might predict that
c75 would lead to an accumulation of fat in the liver, an
undesirable outcome. surprisingly, however, c75 treatment
resulted in the removal of fat accumulated in liver as well as
adipose tissues of dio mice [18]. if fas inhibition causes
an increase in malonyl-coa levels, how could the disappearance of fat occur above that seen in pair fed group?
this paradox has been investigated in a series of experiments that demonstrates that c75 stimulates cpt-1 activity
and, more importantly, fatty acid oxidation.

28

g.v. ronnett et al. / physiology & behavior 85 (2005) 25 – 35

the effects of c75 on fatty acid oxidation were studied
using in vitro cellular models and in vivo using diet-induced
obese (dio) mice [18,47,55,56]. whole animal calorimetry
revealed that c75-treated dio mice had a greater weight
loss and an increased production of energy due to fatty acid
oxidation compared to pair-fed animals. etomoxir, a potent
inhibitor of cpt-1 [57], was able to reverse the increased
energy expenditure and reduced the c75-induced weight
loss by inhibiting fatty acid oxidation. this was mechanistically studied using several cell lines, including rodent
adipocytes, hepatocytes and human breast cancer cells, all
displayed c75-induced increased fatty acid oxidation and
elevated atp levels due to increased cpt-1 activity, even in
the presence of high concentrations of malonyl-coa [55].
consistent with these findings, two other studies demonstrated that c75 can activate cpt-1 and -2 and overcome the
inactivation of cpt-1 by malonyl-coa [58,59]. thus, c75
may cause weight loss not only centrally by reduction in
food intake, but also peripherally by stimulating cpt-1 and
increasing fatty acid oxidation, leading to a loss of adipose
tissue and a resolution of fatty liver in addition to profound
weight loss.
while these studies concerned themselves predominantly
with the effects of c75 on peripheral tissues, c75 also
stimulates cpt-1 activity in neuron in vitro [56]. the
question remains as to how modulation of cpt-1 (inhibition
or stimulation) in hypothalamic regions influences food
intake. it may be important to acknowledge that the
measurement of cpt-1 activity in isolation may not reflect
the activity of the fatty acid oxidation pathway, which may
be the relevant parameter. if cpt-1 is inhibited and levels of
fatty acyl-coa’s increase, acc will be inactivated, causing
malonyl-coa levels to fall. furthermore, malonyl-coa
levels may be tightly controlled, as mcd is highly
expressed in neurons. therefore, cpt-1 activity may
increase to favor fatty acid oxidation. these variables are
complex and make a case for measuring fatty acid oxidation
as a ‘‘readout of pathway activity’’. additionally, ex vivo or
in vitro assays of cpt-1 may not accurately reflect cpt-1
activity in vivo, as cell permeabilization and mitochondrial
isolation alter malonyl-coa levels and disrupt membrane
components that influence cpt-1 activity [28 – 30].
however, elegant studies had already considered the role
of fatty acid oxidation in feeding behavior. studies from
many laboratories, most notably those of ritter and scharrer,
used a variety of pharmacological fatty acid oxidation
inhibitors for multiple enzyme targets to demonstrate that
systemic inhibition of fatty acid oxidation stimulates food
intake in rodents [60 –65]. fatty acid oxidation inhibition
increased food intake in animals fed a fat enriched diet (40%
of metabolizable energy as fat), but was ineffective in
animals consuming a low fat (7% of metabolizable energy as
fat) diet [66], suggesting that a dependence on fatty acid
metabolism was necessary for the feeding effect. beverly et
al. investigated the role of fatty acid oxidation in food intake
centrally [67]. rats treated with a fatty acid oxidation

inhibitor into the ventrolateral hypothalamus displayed
transient decreased food intake, which resolved with
continued administration such that there were no significant
changes in weight or carcass composition after 2 weeks of
central fatty acid oxidation inhibition. in other work, central
injection of  xxxd2777xxx  had an anorectic effect, accompanied
by decreased npy expression [17]. central administration of
another short-chain fatty acid, a- xxxd1887xxx  food
intake without a change in npy levels [68]. these differences may reflect differences in dietary composition or
physiological versus supraphysiological alterations in fatty
acid concentrations during treatments.
thus, it is likely that fatty acid pathways contribute to the
regulation of energy balance and metabolic homeostasis by
distinct mechanisms in the hypothalamus. nonetheless, the
finding that c75 can successfully overcome the inhibitory
effect of malonyl-coa raised issues concerning the hypothesis that malonyl-coa is the mediator of c75’s effects. this
issue shall be addressed using novel compounds that either
inhibit fas or stimulate cpt-1, permitting clarification of
mechanism.

5. the peripheral effects of alterations of fatty acid
metabolism
while the consequences of altered fatty acid metabolism
centrally have generated interest, the effects of peripheral
and perhaps central administration of c75 or  xxxd463xxx  on
fatty acid oxidation in the periphery also contribute to the
effects of these compounds on body weight. it is
reasonable that decreased fas activity would decrease
fat accumulation in peripheral tissues [43]. however, the
dramatic decrease in hepatic fat accumulation in c75treated dio mice compared to pair fed mice instigated
studies that demonstrated that c75, likely through its
stimulation of cpt-1, increases fatty acid oxidation thus
contributing to the profound weight loss seen with c75
[55]. although this effect may be mediated directly by
peripheral mechanisms, a recent study raises the possibility
that central fas inhibition may play a role in increasing
peripheral fatty acid oxidation.
jin et al. demonstrated that central administration of
 xxxd463xxx  increased peripheral cpt-1 activity in isolated
soleus muscle and liver and elevated core temperature [40].
peripheral administration of  xxxd463xxx  initially decreased
cpt-1 activity, but with an hour, cpt-1 activity was
increased. these investigators suggest that  xxxd463xxx  altered
sympathetic activity to cause the increase in cpt-1 activity
and the elevation of core temperature. clarification of these
observations awaits determination of the effect of  xxxd463xxx 
on fatty acid oxidation, not just cpt-1 activity. additionally,
malonyl-coa levels were not fixed in these ex vivo assays,
raising the possibility that fluctuations in malonyl-coa
levels might account for the biphasic changes in cpt-1
activity. a previous study found that  xxxd463xxx  did not alter

g.v. ronnett et al. / physiology & behavior 85 (2005) 25 – 35

fatty acid oxidation [55], and it would be important to
extend these types of studies to the model used by jin et al.
the relationship between fatty acid oxidation inhibition
and the sympathetic nervous system has been studied by
ritter and colleagues [64,69 –72]. fatty acid oxidation
inhibition using mercaptoacetate (ma) stimulated the
release of norepinephrine from the sympathetic system,
but did not induce a release of epinephrine from the adrenal
medulla [64,73]. importantly, the effects of fatty acid
oxidation inhibition (lipoprivic feeding) are also quite
specific, differing significantly from those of 2-deoxyglucose
administration (glucoprivic feeding) [64,72,74]. therefore,
systemic fatty acid oxidation inhibition reduces hepatic atp,
stimulates hepatic vagal afferents to the nts, where signals
are transmitted to the hypothalamus leading to increased
food consumption. what is unclear, but is investigated in the
studies by jin et al. [40] and thupari et al. [55], is the role of
fatty acid oxidation stimulation. again, these issues will be
clarified by future studies that no doubt will evaluate the
role of diet, strain and assay type in outcomes.

6. molecular mediators of c75’s effects
although malonyl-coa is the substrate of fas, other
molecules are required for palmitate synthesis, including
atp (required by acc to generate malonyl-coa) and
nadph. perhaps c75 affects cellular energy balance by
inhibiting fas and/or stimulating cpt-1, which could be
sensed in specific neurons within regions concerned with
appetite or energy homeostasis to alter food intake. we
considered several candidates that might be affected by a
change in energy availability mediated by c75. ampk is
well known as a sensor of peripheral energy balance and a
member of a metabolite-sensing protein kinase family [75 –
78]. increases in the cellular amp/atp ratio, changes in ph
and redox status, and increases in the creatine/phosphocreatine ratio phosphorylated and activate ampk [76,79 –
81]. in turn, ampk alters cellular metabolism and gene
expression to collectively inhibit anabolic processes and
stimulate catabolic processes in an attempt to restore atp
levels [78,82]. ampk is a heterotrimeric protein consisting
of an a catalytic subunit and regulatory h and g subunits
[82]. there are two a isoforms, a1 and 2 [83]. in the adult
brain, the a2 subunit is the predominantly expressed
isoform in neurons [83,84]. in the periphery, ampk activity
is regulated by vigorous exercise, nutrient starvation and
ischemia –hypoxia [76,78]. ampk is activated when the
amp/atp ratio increased; amp activates ampk kinase
(ampkk), which phosphorylates ampk on thr172 on the
 xxxg220xxx  [79]. high concentrations of atp inhibit ampk
activity [85].
the changes incurred with ampk activation in the
periphery are complex, and include acute regulation of
important metabolic pathways, followed by chronic transcriptional changes. ampk inhibits anabolism (fatty acid

29

synthesis, triglyceride synthesis) and stimulates catabolism
(fatty acid oxidation, glycolysis and glucose uptake). as
concerns fatty acid synthesis, ampk phosphorylates and
inactivates acc, thus inhibiting fatty acid synthesis by
decreasing malonyl-coa availability [86]. ampk also
phosphorylates and inactivates hmg (3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl)-coa reductase, thus affecting the biosynthesis of
isoprenoids and cholesterol [87,88]. 6-phosphofructo-2
kinase (pfk) is phosphorylated by ampk, thus increasing
fructose-2,6-bisphosphate activity, thereby stimulating 6phosphofructo-1-kinase (pfk-1), and increasing glycolysis.
ampk knockout mice indicate distinct roles for the two a
subunits. while  xxxg1830xxx -deficient mice that have no
apparent metabolic defect, ampka2-deficient mice display
metabolic defects, including reduced glycogen synthesis,
glucose intolerance and insulin resistance [89].
beyond its role as a peripheral energy sensor, recent
studies have focused on the role of ampk in neuronal
energy metabolism. using a primary neuronal culture
system, we demonstrated a role for fas, cpt-1 and ampk
in neuronal energy metabolism in vitro [56]. c75 inhibits
fas, and increases cpt-1 activity, fatty acid oxidation and
glucose oxidation in neurons, similar to its effect in
peripheral tissues [56]. concomitantly, atp levels increase
following a brief (15 min) drop. this biphasic effect on atp
levels (a brief drop and then a significant increase) was seen
with c75 and  xxxd463xxx , but not with tofa. tofa
treatment actually resulted in the largest increase in atp
levels, but was not preceded by an initial drop in atp levels.
for  xxxd463xxx  and c75, these fluctuations in atp levels
were accompanied by changes in ampk phosphorylation
and activity: the initial drop in atp paralleled the increase in
ampk phosphorylation and activity, whereas the subsequent prolonged increase in atp correlates with a significant decrease in phosphorylation and ampk activity. most
surprisingly, tofa treatment, which caused the largest
increase in atp levels, did not alter ampk activity. it is
intriguing to speculate that this is why tofa treatment
interfered with the effect of c75 on food intake: tofa
would disrupt the biphasic fluctuation in atp levels,
thereby interfering with ampk inhibition, negating c75’s
effects. it would be the effect of tofa on atp levels and
not on decreasing malonyl-coa levels, which is the key
event. nonetheless, it is clear that pharmacological alterations in neuronal fatty acid metabolism can influence
neuronal energy balance and ampk activity.
could these effects of c75 on ampk and neuronal
energy balance mediate some of the effects of c75 seen in
vivo? during the past year, studies from several laboratories
have revealed that hypothalamic ampk serves as a neuronal energy sensor in the regulation of food intake [11,90,91].
we investigated a role for hypothalamic ampk in the
regulation of feeding using a pharmacological approach
[11]. aicar (5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide-1-h-dribofuranoside) is a compound that is taken up into cells
and phosphorylated to form zmp [92], which mimics the

30

g.v. ronnett et al. / physiology & behavior 85 (2005) 25 – 35

fig. 1. working model for the effects of c75 on the fas pathway. (a) during states of energy surplus, acetyl-coa carboxylase (acc) catalyzes the synthesis
of malonyl-coa from acetyl-coa in an atp-dependent reaction.  xxxg765xxx  (fas) then synthesizes palmitate by a series of condensation, reduction
and dehydration cycles that utilizes nadph. acyl-coa synthase (acs) adds the coa group to generate  xxxd2832xxx -coa. under conditions of energy surplus,
malonyl-coa levels are high and inhibit carnitine palmitoyltransferase-1 (cpt-1) from transporting long-chain acyl-coa’s into mitochondria for oxidation, as
this would constitute a futile cycle. (b) during states of energy deficiency, ambient levels of malonyl-coa fall, permitting long-chain acyl-coa’s to enter the
mitochondria for oxidation. (c) we hypothesize that c75 inhibits fas and stimulates cpt-1 to alter cellular energy balance, even when malonyl-coa levels
are elevated.

effects of amp on ampk activation [93], thus stimulating
ampk activity. aicar increases food intake, whereas c75
and  xxxd1930xxx , an inhibitor of ampk, decrease food
intake. c75 rapidly (minutes) reduces the level of the

phosphorylated ampka (pampka) subunit in the hypothalamus, even in fasted mice that had elevated hypothalamic pampka levels. aicar is able to reverse both the
c75-induced anorexia and the decrease in hypothalamic

g.v. ronnett et al. / physiology & behavior 85 (2005) 25 – 35

pampka levels. as shown in vitro, c75 elevates hypothalamic neuronal atp levels, which we hypothesize
contributes to the mechanism through which c75 decreases
ampk activity. c75 also reduces the level of phosphorylated camp response element binding protein (pcreb) in
the arcuate nucleus, suggesting a mechanism for the
reduction in npy expression seen with c75 treatment.
these data indicate that modulation of fatty acid activity in
the hypothalamus can alter neuronal energy perception via
ampk, which may function as a physiological energy
sensor in the hypothalamus.
additional studies on the role of ampk in the sensing of
neuronal energy balance have emerged. leptin inactivates
hypothalamic ampk, leading to anorexia [91], whereas it
activates ampk in skeletal muscle [94]. intriguingly, the
central administration of anorexigenic factors including
insulin, glucose or mc3, and 4 agonists also inactivate
ampk [90]. in contrast, agrp, ghrelin or aicar activate
hypothalamic ampk, perhaps contributing to the resulting
hyperphagia [90].
our studies suggest a mechanism by which c75 can
affect feeding behavior at least in part by modulating
ampk activity. by inhibiting fas and stimulating cpt-1,
c75 increases atp levels in hypothalamic neurons. this
would signal a positive energy balance, inactivating ampk,
and contribute to a decrease in npy expression. when
energy stores are depleted or decreased by fasting or
increased activity, ampk is activated, activating several
downstream signals, including the creb-npy pathway to
influence food intake. under physiological conditions
(normal feeding), it appears that there is relatively little
change in the level of phosphorylated ampk in the
hypothalamus; a prolonged period of decreased food intake
appears to be required before hypothalamic pampk levels
increase. thus, ampk may function as a ‘‘fuel sensor’’ in
the cns, as it does in peripheral tissues such as muscle
[88,94]. although several pathways have been proposed to
function upstream of ampk pathway [95], the contributions
of these pathways remain to be elucidated.
an intriguing study by wortman et al. hypothesized that
the anorexic action of c75 could be mediated by a change in
glucose uptake or utilization in the cns [45]. thus, feeding
rats an essentially carbohydrate-free diet abrogated the
effects of c75 on food intake. the effect of c75 was
restored by the addition of other nutrient sources. while it
has been shown, at least in vitro, that c75 increases glucose
oxidation, this effect was transient when compared to the
increase in fatty acid oxidation [56]. the hypothesis posed
by wortman et al. did not account for  xxxd2154xxx  as an
energy source, as it was assumed c75 would inhibit fatty
acid oxidation. however, the contribution of increased
glucose utilization may still be significant and explain the
results obtained using a carbohydrate-free diet. alternatively, it must be considered that a high fat diet will
essentially shut down the fas pathway; therefore, c75 may
have had no effect as fas was already inactive due to a lack

31

of available malonyl-coa. yet, the results obtained by
wortman et al. are striking and clearly warrant further in
vivo investigations.

7. fas and cpt-1 modulation also influence gene
expression
initial studies on the effects of c75 on weight loss and
energy production utilized an acute treatment paradigm.
chronic exposure to c75 could potentially act through
another mechanism in the cns and in peripheral tissues,
due to its effects on fatty acid synthesis and oxidation. a 2week chronic c75 treatment model was used to treat both
dio and lean mice to examine the effects of c75 on body
weight, food intake and energy expenditure [47]. over this
2-week period, c75 treatment was more efficacious in dio
mice compared to lean mice as measured by increased
weight loss, decreased food intake and increased energy
expenditure in the dio mice compared to the lean mice. it
was hypothesized that changes in gene expression in the
dio mice might account for this observation.
overall, analysis of the gene expression changes in
hypothalamus in the 2-week dio c75 treatment paradigm
demonstrate the inhibition of orexigenic neuropeptide
expression and induction of anorexigenic neuropeptide
expression. despite differences in the method of measurement of mrna levels, the overall patterns of expression are
similar to our prior study [18] and reflect the decreased food
consumption seen in c75-treated mice. however, studies
have shown differences in hypothalamic neuropeptide
responses between dio and lean rodents [96 – 100], and
consistent with those studies, c75 treatment had a qualitatively different effect on hypothalamic neuropeptide
expression in dio and lean mice. c75 inhibited orexigenic
neuropeptide (npy, agrp) expression and increased
anorexigenic neuropeptide (pomc and cart) expression
in dio mice. in contrast, in lean mice, c75 decreased
expression of anorexigenic neuropeptides (pomc and
cart) without a change in orexigenic neuropeptides
(npy, agrp) expression. dio mice continued to demonstrate reduced food intake and a strongly anorexigenic
neuropeptide profile throughout the duration of treatment. in
contrast, by the conclusion of treatment, lean mice were
eating an amount nearly equivalent to controls and they had
only a modestly orexigenic hypothalamic profile.
interestingly, chronic c75 treatment induced a number
of changes in gene expression in peripheral tissues [47]. a
number of these changes were limited to the c75-treated
dio group and most commonly involved wat. in
combination, many of these changes favored the oxidation
of fatty acid over their incorporation into triglyceride.
specifically, acch was down regulated by c75 along with
glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase ( xxxg1808xxx ), while expression of the liver isoform of cpt-1 was increased.  xxxg1808xxx  is
the initial committed step for fatty acid incorporation into

32

g.v. ronnett et al. / physiology & behavior 85 (2005) 25 – 35

structural lipids or triglycerides [101]. these alterations
would favor the entrance of fatty acid into the mitochondria
for oxidation, and direct  xxxd2154xxx  away from storage and
toward oxidation. c75 also increased the expression of
 xxxg2375xxx  in wat, liver and muscle. in addition to promoting
uncoupling of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation,
 xxxg2375xxx  has a role in limiting free radical formation during
fatty acid oxidation [102]. through its mitochondrial
uncoupling, increased  xxxg2375xxx  expression could allow for
increased fatty acid oxidation without the necessity of
producing excess atp. the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (ppars) are a group of three nuclear
receptor isoforms,  xxxg1805xxx ,  xxxg1807xxx  and ppary, regulate a
variety of functions related to energy metabolism [103].
c75 affected the expression of  xxxg1805xxx  and  xxxg1807xxx . in dio
mice, c75 reduced the expression of  xxxg1807xxx  in wat,
further promoting the reduction of lipid storage. in the
liver, c75 reduced the expression of  xxxg1805xxx  despite the
increased expression of both l-cpt-1 and aco. these
data suggest that the pattern of gene expression favoring
fatty acid oxidation was not due to increased  xxxg1805xxx 
activity, but via a yet undetermined mechanism. accomplishing increased fatty acid oxidation without enhancing
 xxxg1805xxx  expression could have a particular advantage to
cardiac muscle. increased  xxxg1805xxx  expression increases
fatty acid transport beyond the capacity of increased fatty
acid oxidation leading to fatty acid deposition in cardiac
muscle. this is thought to be the mechanism responsible
for diabetic cardiomyopathy [104]. real-time rt-pcr
measurements on cardiac muscle after 1 month of c75
treatment failed to show any increase in  xxxg1805xxx  expression
(data not shown).
several interesting observations can be made from the
chronic treatment paradigm. the results of our fatty acid
metabolism gene expression analysis advance our understanding of the selectivity of c75 in reducing adipose tissue
mass, as opposed the lean mass. it appears reasonable that
the dramatic increase in fatty acid oxidation in c75-treated
dio mice would likely require more than competitive
stimulation of cpt-1. interestingly, additional studies have
shown that the weight loss effect of c75 treatment persists
for nearly 2 weeks beyond cessation of therapy (thupari and
kuhajda, personal communication), further supporting the
importance of these gene expression changes on c75 weight
maintenance. the exploration of the mechanism of action of
c75 serves to further our understanding of the biological
consequences of fatty acid synthesis inhibition and fatty
acid oxidation stimulation in vivo.

8. conclusions
collectively, the results presented here demonstrate that
c75 treatment has several effects on neuronal energy
metabolism and on neuronal activity. by altering glucose
and fatty acid metabolism, and thus neuronal energy levels,

c75 may influence energy perception, at least partially
through the modulation of ampk activity. we believe that
the effect of c75 on neuronal energy is physiologically
relevant due to the robust effect on neuronal activity and on
downstream energy-sensing molecules such as ampk,
followed by alterations in pathways that are regulated by
ampk (acc phosphorylation and glucose metabolism).
this shift in the energy state of the neuron could signal the
cns, via altering neuronal activity, to inhibit feeding.
understanding the effect of modulating fatty acid metabolism on neuronal energy perception could lead to a better
understanding of the mechanisms underlying feeding
behavior and could potentially lead to new therapeutic
targets for weight loss.
