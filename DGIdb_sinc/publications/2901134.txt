summary
administration of  xxxd1787xxx  (/~- xxxd1787xxx ;  xxxd1787xxx ) to rats
has been shown to decrease the levels of somatostatin-like immunoreactivity (sli)
in the gastrointestinal tract and pancreas but its mode of action is unclear. in the
current study the effect of  xxxd1787xxx  on gastrointestinal and pancreatic sli has been
studied using two antisera with different regional specificities. in addition, the in vitro
effect of  xxxd1787xxx  on ss-14 and ss-28 has been studied by high-performance liquid
chromatography (hplc). characterization of the two antisera (as 26.3.2 and as
1001) with a range of analogs of ss-14 revealed that both were directed against the
midportion of the molecule but that as 1001 was also sensitive to changes at the
n- and c-termini. tissue extracts from  xxxd1787xxx -treated rats measured with as
26.3.2 showed no significant change for the stomach, jejunum or pancreas but duodenal levels were reduced. with as 1001 sli levels were reduced in all tissues. gel
permeation chromatography of stomach extracts measured with as 1001 showed a
reduction in both ss-i4 and ss-28. with as 26.3.2 an increase in sli eluting prior
to the ss-14 peak occurred explaining why no significant reduction in total sli was
detected. with duodenal extracts the elution profiles with as 1001 reflected the large
reduction in total sli whereas with as 26.3.2 a smaller reduction occurred. both
ss-14 and ss-28 were reduced. hplc analysis of ss-14 and ss-28 following incubation with  xxxd1787xxx  in vitro showed a time-dependent decrease in both somatostatin species when absorbance at 280 nm was measured. new peptide peaks which

developed were not all detectable by radioimmunoassay with either antibody. the
results suggest that  xxxd1787xxx  causes a change in the structure of somatostatin which
probably first involves a reduction of the disulphide bridge and then the n- and cterminal regions of the molecule thus making it unmeasurable by antisera sensitive
to changes in these regions.

introduction

administration of cytsteamine (fl- xxxd1787xxx ;  xxxd1787xxx ) to
rats has been shown to decrease the levels of somatostatin-like immunoreactivity
(sli) in the stomach, intestine and pancreas [1-5], various regions of the brain
[4,6-12], the retina [11,13] and spinal cord [11,14,15]. this depleting action of  xxxd1787xxx  is still not understood and a number of ambiguities exist in the literature.
several different molecular forms of sli exist in tissues, the major ones being
 xxxg2205xxx  (ss-14),  xxxg2205xxx  (ss-28) and the  xxxg2296xxx  of
ss-28 (ss-28-(1-12)). some groups ill,12] found that  xxxd1787xxx  decreased all detected forms of central nervous sli as assessed chromatographically whereas bakhit
et al. [6] found reduced levels with an antiserum against ss-14 but not with an antiserum against ss-28-(1-12) or one directed to the mid-portion of ss-28. in contrast
patel and pierzchala [2] showed chromatographically that  xxxd1787xxx  caused a reduction in jejunal ss-28 when measured with an antiserum directed towards the
15-28 region of the molecule but not with an antiserum directed towards the 1-14
region of ss-28, suggesting that  xxxd1787xxx  acts at the ring portion of the molecule.
immunohistochemical studies have also shown variable results.  xxxd1787xxx  produced
a large reduction in somatostatin-containing neurones in the hypothalamus [8,16],
striatum [7] and substantia gelatinosa [14] when detected with an antiserum against
ss-14. no changes in hypothalamic neurones were detected with an antiserum against
ss-28-(1-12) [16]. kanatsuka et al. [1] observed only a slight reduction in staining of
pancreatic d-cells whereas seiler et al. [17] found marked changes in both gastric
and pancreatic cells in  xxxd1787xxx -treated rats. patel et al. [18] could find no change
in pancreatic d-cells using electron microscopic immunocytochemistry.
overall these studies suggest that  xxxd1787xxx  acts on the ring portion of the somatostatin molecule but that not all antisera will detect a reduction in immunoreactivity. the current study was initiated since minimal or no reduction in sli content
of gastric and pancreatic extracts from rats orally administered  xxxd1787xxx  was found
with a specific antiserum (as 26.3.2) against ss-14 routinely used in radioimmunoassay [19]. the effect of  xxxd1787xxx  on gastrointestinal and pancreatic sli has
therefore been reassessed by radioimmunoassay using two different antisera. in addition, the effect of  xxxd1787xxx  on ss-14 and ss-28 in vitro has been studied by
hplc.

materials and methods

treatment of animals with cysteam&e and tissue collection
female sprague-dawley rats (250 g) were starved overnight.  xxxd1787xxx -hc1
( xxxd1787xxx -hydrochloride, sigma chemical co. st. louis, mo) was administered as a 90 mg/ml aqueous solution in a dose of 30 mg/100 g b. wt. either orally
(n = 6), by a metal stomach tube, or subcutaneously (n = 3). control animals (n
= 6) received an equivalent oral volume of water. rats were sacrificed by cervical
dislocation 4 h later. the stomach was rapidly removed, the corpus/antrum region
dissected out and the tissue (838-1248 rag) snap-frozen on dry ice. pancreas (7451417 mg) and sections of the duodenum and jejunum (570-1536 rag) were similarly
removed and frozen.
tissue extraction
tissues were weighed while frozen, extracted with 5 ml ice-cold 2 m acetic acid
boiled for 10 min. the volume was made up to 10 ml with 2 m acetic acid. tissues
were then homogenized with a tekmar tissumizer (model sdt-1810) and stored at
- 2 0 ° c . prior to assay for sli, aliquots of the extracts were centrifuged at 14,000 g,
the supernatants neutralized with 2 m naoh and diluted with assay buffer. each
extract was measured in at least 3 dilutions. protein content was determined by a
modification of the procedure of lowry et al. [20].
radio immunoassay s
assays for sli were performed using two antisera. the conditions of assay for
antiserum 26.3.2 were identical to those previously described [19] apart from the
substitution of bovine  xxxg124xxx  (bsa; miles ria insulin grade, miles, ont.,
canada) for human  xxxg124xxx . assays using antiserum as 1001 utilized a 0.05
m ammonium acetate buffer, ph 4.6, containing 0.5% bsa and 1% aprotinin (trasylol, miles, ont., canada). this antiserum was kindly provided by dr. t. yamada,
ann arbor, mi.  xxxd1787xxx  had no effect on either assay.
characterization of the two antisera was performed with a range of analogs, as
indicated in fig. 1, kindly provided by drs. d.h. coy and w. murphy, tulane
university medical center, new orleans, la. icso values were calculated from displacement curves for each analog. these values were then expressed as a percentage
of that obtained for ss-14 according to the formula: (icso for ss-14/ic5o for the
analog) x 100. this is referred to as the relative icso in the text.
gel permeation chromatography of t&sue extracts
gel permeation chromatography of unneutralized supernatants (1-2 ml), was performed on sephadex g25 fine columns (1400 cm x 1 cm) at a flow rate of 0.7 ml/min.
the eluent was 0.2 m acetic acid containing 0.05% bovine  xxxg124xxx  (bsa;
miles ria grade) and 1 ml fractions were collected. two 200/a aliquots of collected
fractions were lyophilized and, prior to assay, were dissolved in 100 #1 of the appropriate assay buffer for radioimmunoassay with as1001 or as 26.3.2.

208

studies on the effect of  xxxd1787xxx  on ss-14 and ss-28 in vitro
ss-14 or ss-28 (peninsula labs., ca) was dissolved in hplc-grade water to give
a final concentration of 1 pg/10 pl. a 5 pg sample was immediately analyzed by
hplc as described below.  xxxd1787xxx , dissolved in water, was added to give a final
concentration of 10 mm. samples were removed after various time periods, as indicated in the figures, and analyzed by hplc. the water used to dissolve the somatostatin and  xxxd1787xxx  was pregassed for 20 min with nitrogen prior to use.
chromatography was performed on a waters 1-125 protein column (7.8 mm × 300
ram) with water containing 0.1% trifluoracetic acid (tfa) at a flow rate of i ml/min
and detection was performed at 280 nm. solvent was purged with helium prior to
use and blanketted with the same gas. the eluent collected in 0.5 min fractions and
diluted in the appropriate assay buffer for radioimmunoassay with as 1001 or as
26.3.2.
the chromatography apparatus consisted of waters associates units: one model
6000 a pump, one m45 pump, a model u6k sample injector, and a model 450
variable wavelength detector. chromatograms were recorded on a hewlett packard
3380 integrator.
data expression and analysis
the tissue content of sli is expressed as mean :t: s.e.m. in pg/mg protein. statistical significance was calculated according to student's t-test for unpaired samples,

results

antisera characterization
both antisera as 26.3.2 and as 1001 detected ss-14 and ss-28 (fig. 1). however,
the relative icso for ss-28 was 96:1: 4% with as 26.3.2 and 50 + 1% with as 1001.
changes in the mid-portion of the molecule had similar effects in that there was no
displacement with any analog, except phe 9 and glu 9, with either antiserum and slight
displacement with phe ~° for as 1001. changes in the 9-10 region had a greater effect
with as 26.3.2 than with as 1001. modification of the ss-14 molecule at the n- and
c-termini had different effects with the two antisera. with as 1001 des-ala-glyss-14 exhibited only 40% of the displacement of ss-14 whereas with as 26.3.2 there
was equivalent displacement. changes at positions 4 and 5 also had a greater effect
with as 1001 than with as 26.3.2, and changes at positions 12 and 13 reduced the
relative icso with as 1001 to a much greater extent.
effect of  xxxd1787xxx  treatment on gastrointestinal tissue levels of sli
the levels of sli in tissue extracts from  xxxd1787xxx -treated and control rats are
shown in fig. 2 and the percentage changes of treated compared to controls summarized in table i. with as 26.3.2, there was no significant change in the stomach,
jejunum or pancreas but duodenal levels were reduced in animals administered  xxxd1787xxx  by both the oral and subcutaneous routes. with as 1001, sli levels were
reduced in both treated groups and in all tissues, although the degree of reduction

26.3.2 (b). r a d i o i m m u n o a s s a y s were performed as described in materials and methods using as 1001 or
as 26.3.2. the icso values were calculated for displacement of 125i-labelled ss-14 by ss-14, ss-28 and
the analogs indicated in the figures. the latter values were then compared with the ics0 obtained with
ss-14 according to the formula: (ic50 for ss-14/ic5o for the analog) x 100. displacement curves were
performed in triplicate. with ss-14 and ss-28 the data are the mean 5: s.e.m. of 6 separate assays and
with the analogs it is the average of 2 separate assays.

fig. 3. sephadex g25 chromatography of stomach extracts from rats orally administered  xxxd1787xxx  (a1
and c1) or water (b1). extracts (1-2 ml) were applied to sephadex g25 fine columns (1400 cm x 1 cm)
and chromatography performed at a flow rate of 0.7 ml/min. the eluant was 0.2 m acetic acid containing
0.05% bsa. 1 ml fractions were collected and aliquots processed for assay with either as 26.3.2 or as
1001 as described in materials and methods.

(1-2 ml) from a total of 3 control and 4 animals treated orally with  xxxd1787xxx  were
processed. similar profiles were obtained in the other chromatograms. in the following description the immunoreactive material eluting in the region of standard ss-14
will be referred to as ss-14 and that eluting in the region of ss-28 as ss-28. with
antiserum as 1001, ss-14 ranged between 66% and 75% and ss-28 between 8%
and 19% of recovered immunoreactivity in extracts from both control and  xxxd1787xxx -treated animals. the total recovered immunoreactivity with the extracts from
 xxxd1787xxx -treated rats was lower than that in controls, probably reflecting a reduction in both somatostatin species although the low amounts of ss-28 in the stomach
do not allow a definitive statement to be made. with as 26.3.2, ss-14 constituted
68-83% and ss-28 9-14% in extracts from control animals. the proportion of ss28 (7-13%) did not change in  xxxd1787xxx -treated rats but that of ss-14 was reduced
to 50-57%. this was due to an increase in sli eluting prior to the ss-14 peak.

therefore, although there was a reduction in ss-14 the new immunoreactive peaks
generated explain why no significant reduction in total sli was detected using this
antiserum, whereas as 1001 did not detect these species and therefore detected an
overall reduction.

gel filtration column, since  xxxd1787xxx  eluted before ss-14 and in the same position
as ss-28. it was, however, suitable for analysis of the effects of  xxxd1787xxx  on the
peptides.
incubation of ss-14 with  xxxd1787xxx  caused a decrease in the peptide peak in a
time-dependent manner when detected by absorbance or radioimmunoassay (figs.
5 and 6). two new peaks appeared when absorbance at 280 nm was measured but
only one of these peaks was detectable with the radioimmunoassay using either antibody 1001 or 26.3.2. the decrease in ss-14 was greater when measured with antibody 1001 than with 26.3.2.
 xxxd1787xxx  also caused a decrease in the peak of ss-28, when assessed by absorbance or radioimmunoassay, and the appearance of a further peak eluting prior to
the ss-28 peak (figs. 7 and 8). however, the rate of change was much slower than
with ss-14 and even after 4 h conversion was only partial. the new peak demonstrated very low immunoreactivity with antisera asa001 and as 26.3.2.

discussion

a number of studies have demonstrated a reduction in tissue content of sli in
rats treated with  xxxd1787xxx  but the mode of action is still not certain. in the present
study, the decreases in somatostatin obtained when measured by radioimmunoassay
using antiserum as 1001 (table i; fig. 2) were of a similar level to those reported
for the stomach, duodenum, jejunum and pancreas [1,2,4,5] whereas changes with
antiserum as 26.3.2 were either much smaller or non-existent. this suggested that
fairly specific and localized changes were occurring in the somatostatin molecule
resulting in reduced immunoreactivity. these differences can be explained by the
characteristics of the two antisera. antiserum as 1001 is more sensitive to changes
at the n- and c-termini, as exemplified by the redt~ced displacement produced by
[des-ala-gly]ss-14, ss-14 analogs changed at positions 4, 12 and 13, and ss-28 when
compared to as 26.3.2 (fig. 1). the higher control values for the pancreas when
measured with as i001 are anomalous. the only amino acids for which changes
affected binding to as 1001 less than with as 26.3.2 were those at positions 9 and
10. oxidation of tryptophan can occur, but this generally requires strong oxidising
reagents and is unlikely to account for the disparity.
the degree of  xxxd1787xxx -induced reduction varied in the different tissues as found
for the brain [4,6 12,16] and was never complete. it has been suggested that this is
due to an effect on a readily releasable pool of somatostatin [6,7] but it could also
be a reflection of the local concentration of  xxxd1787xxx  achieved following peripheral
administration.
the gel permeation chromatography profiles demonstrated that sli eluting in the
regions of both ss-14 and ss-28 was reduced. this is in agreement with studies on
the jejunum [2], retina, brain and spinal cord [11,12] but in contrast to those of bakhit
et al. [6] in which region-specific assays indicated that ss-14 but not ss-28 was depleted.
the hplc studies showed that  xxxd1787xxx  can modify somatostatin in vitro as

215

well as in vivo. it is likely that  xxxd1787xxx  initially reduces the disulphide bond of
somatostatin and then induces secondary modification of the molecule. although the
nature of these secondary changes is unknown, and can only be speculated upon,
studies on the effect of  xxxd1787xxx  on prolactin are of relevance since both molecules
contain a c-terminal cysteine. as with somatostatin,  xxxd1787xxx  produces a reduction
in immunoreactive prolactin tissue content both in vivo [21-25] and in vitro [26,27].
electrdphoretic studies demonstrated heterogeneity and an increase in the size of
extracted prolactin, and it has been suggested [26] that this might be due to both a
reduction of the large-loop intramolecular disulphide bond and subsequent unwinding of the molecule and production of a number of higher molecular weight forms
by disulphide interchange reactions [21,23,27].
previous studies have reported that there is no effect of  xxxd1787xxx  on somatostatin in vitro. the present studies were performed in a slightly acidic medium (ph
5.0), under which conditions  xxxd1787xxx  would be in the h3n +-ch2-ch2-sh (pk
8.3) form [27], and in the absence of air, and this may explain the observed changes.
with adenohypophysial secretory granules in vitro there was a ph-dependent decrease in immunoreactive prolactin with little or no inhibition at alkaline ph [21,27].
the prolactin secretory granules are known to be acidic in nature [23] and although
there are no data available regarding somatostatin-containing granules, a similar
situation may pertain. this may be critical for the action of  xxxd1787xxx  in vivo.
scammel and dannies [23] also suggested that the failure to demonstrate an in vitro
effect of  xxxd1787xxx  on prolactin may be partly due to oxidation since < 15% of
 xxxd1787xxx  in solution remains after 60 rain in air; this is in agreement with the
present results on somatostatin. as previously mentioned, the antibody characterization data suggest that, although both antisera detect changes in the centre of the
molecule, as 1001 is more sensitive to changes at the n- and c-terminus. the failure
of bakhit et al. [6] to detect a change in ss-28 may have resulted from the utilization
of an antiserum which was relatively insensitive to changes at the n-terminus and/or
the apparently slower and less complete modification of ss-28 by  xxxd1787xxx  as
demonstrated in the in vitro study.
the present data are in agreement with the suggestion that the changes in both
somatostatin and prolactin are a result of  xxxd1787xxx  initially acting on the disulphide
bridge possibly followed by formation of co-ordination complexes between the -nh2
and -cooh groups [21]. an additional effect on somatostatin synthesis may also
play a role [28]. the overall changes result in a loss of immunoreactivity.
a number of studies have indicated that the biological activity of somatostatin is
altered by  xxxd1787xxx  in parallel with a reduction in sli. following  xxxd1787xxx  treatment, changes in body temperature regulation [8], adrenal catecholamine secretion
[8], basal, episodic, and stimulated growth hormone secretion [29,30], and reflex responses to a painful chemical stimulus [14,15], accompanied a reduction in central
nervous system sli. a reduction in pancreatic sli resulted in a potentiation of
insulin secretion from the in vitro perfused pancreas [1]. however, care is needed in
interpreting these changes as being a result of somatostatin depletion. although the
in vitro secretion of sli from tissues obtained from  xxxd1787xxx -treated rats was
reduced [3,16],  xxxd1787xxx  also acutely stimulated hypothalamic sli secretion in vitro

216
[6,16,31] and increased the number of cerebrocortical somatostatin receptors [12]. in
addition,  xxxd1787xxx -induced changes in  xxxd3368xxx  and/~-endorphin secretion may
have been a result of inhibition of central dopamine/%hydroxylase [32]. therefore,
the overall effect of  xxxd1787xxx  could involve a change in chemical structure of the
somatostatin molecule, an effect on somatostatin secretion, changes in receptors and
indirect actions.
what would be the implicatons of a decrease in gastrointestinal tissue somatostatin content and/or secretion if biological activity is indeed reduced in parallel with
immunological activity?  xxxd1787xxx  is widely used as an ulcerogenic agent [4,5,3343]. in  xxxd1787xxx -treated rats the secretion of gastric acid [33,34,41,43-45], gastrin
[46-48] and gastric mucin [49] are all increased and mucosal histamine and histidine
decarboxylase activity decreased [50]. these changes may play a role in the ulcer
formation and could be secondary to a decrease in somatostatin content or secretion.
however, gallagher and szabo [33] found that although the gastric output of acid
and pepsin were increased in  xxxd1787xxx -treated rats the acid output did not parallel
the duodenal ulcerogenic activity and could not alone explain the ulcer formation.
they concluded that hyperacidity at the ulcer site may occur and that the fate of acid
in the proximal duodenum may be one of the pathogenetic factors.  xxxd1787xxx  also
delays gastric emptying [36,51], induces intestinal hypermotility [52,53], causes a rapid increase in duodenal acidity and pepsin levels [34,54], and decreases duodenal
brunner's gland secretion [35,54] thereby reducing the capacity for neutralization
[55]. which, if any, of these changes are secondary to changes in somatostatin is at
present unknown.
