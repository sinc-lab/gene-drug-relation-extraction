enzyme induction

1. introduction
potassium deficiency caused an increase in
activity of the (na* + k* )-activated atpase of
the heart muscle of the guinea pig (erdmann
et al., 1971). digitalis glycosides are supposed
to inhibit the (na ÷ + k÷)-activated atpase and
diminish the intracellular k ÷ concentration or
delay the restitution of the intracellular ionic
concentration. we therefore tested whether
an inhibition of the atpase by long term
treatment with  xxxd1884xxx  might possibly
change the activity of this enzyme.
2. materials and methods

2.1. subjects
male guinea pigs (pirbright white) weighing
300--600 g were used. control groups were
fed altromin pellets no. 3012, test animals
were treated either with the potassium deficient test diet altromin or with the control
* supported by the deutsche
s c h a f t ( s f b 30 cardiologie).

forschungsgemein-

diet and subcutaneous injections of 0.3 mg/kg
 xxxd1884xxx . male rats (wistar ii) weighing 250-400 g were fed the potassium deficient test
diet altromin; the controls were fed this diet
with the addition of 1.2% kc1.

2.2. procedure
brain (na ÷ + k÷)-atpase was prepared as
described previously by borsch-galetke et al.
(1972), heart and kidney (na ÷ + k÷)-atpase
were prepared according to the method of
skou (1962) with modifications as described
by dransfeld et al. (1967). protein content
was measured by the  xxxd2444xxx  method and the
inorganic phosphate liberated was measured
according to the method of allen (1940). the
incubation medium for determining the enzyme activity contained (mm) na ÷ 100, k ÷
10, mg 2÷ 3 and atp 3 in a tris-buffer ph 7.4.
plasma sodium and potassium were measured
using an eppendorf flame photometer.  xxxd1884xxx  or  xxxd2799xxx  toxicity was estimated by i.v.
infusion (40--60 min) in guinea pigs or rats
anaesthetised with urethane (1.5 g/kg).

3. results

 xxxd1884xxx  0.3 mgikg

14-15 days

fig. 1 shows results of experiments in
which guinea pigs were treated for up to 24
days with  xxxd1884xxx . a treatment of only a
few days duration (1--5 days) had no effect
on the activity of the (na ÷ + k+)-atpase of
heart muscle, but after 7--24 days there was
a significant increase in enzyme activity of
about 30% compared to controls. during this
period no relationship was found between the
duration of treatment and the size of the increase in activity.
in fig. 2 we compared the influence of long
term treatment with  xxxd1884xxx  with the effect
of 12 days' treatment with the potassium deficient diet on the (na t + k+)-atpase activity.
in both experiments the atpase of the heart
muscle was significantly enhanced by about
30 and 40% respectively, whereas the enzyme
of kidney and brain showed no significant alteration in activity compared to controls. the
resulting increase in heart atpase activity in
the guinea pig after potassium deficiency is in

the

accordance with observations of erdmann et
al. {1971), who found an even more pronounced increase of up to 130%.
in potassium-depleted animals, we found
that the k ÷ concentration in serum and skeletal muscle was significantly diminished by 33
and 11% respectivley, whereas threatment
with  xxxd1884xxx  did not significantly alter the
k ÷ concentration in serum, heart and skeletal
muscle.
the toxicity of  xxxd1884xxx  during potassium
deficiency was significantly enhanced (1.55
+ 0.15 mg/kg for controls, 1.17 + 0.15 mg/kg
for test animals) whereas long term treatment

(na ÷ + k+)-atpase in heart muscle after  xxxd1884xxx 

with  xxxd1884xxx  did n o t significantly alter its
t o x i c i t y (1.46 -+ 0.19 mg/kg). in b o t h experiments the k ÷ c o n t e n t of t he heart muscle remained unchanged. in rats a k ÷ deficient diet
for 6--8 weeks p r o d u c e d a marked decrease in
the k ÷ c o n t e n t o f serum (from 4.9 t o 1.9
mval/1) and skeletal muscle (from 460 to 304
mval/kg) whereas th e k + c o n t e n t of the heart
muscle was only slightly diminished {from
378 to 355 mval/kg n.s.).
the activity o f the (na ÷ + k÷)-atpase o f
the heart muscle, as well as of the kidney and
the brain, showed no significant alteration
compared to controls. additional t r e a t m e n t
with s.c. injections of 1.25 mg/kg  xxxd1884xxx 
over a period o f 8 days did n o t pr oduce an increase in activity. the t o x i c i t y of ouabain increased significantly f r o m 33.5 to 13.6 + 1.4
mg/kg in k ÷ deficient animals.

4. discussion
in th e present study hypokalemia, as well
as chronic t r e a t m e n t with  xxxd1884xxx , p r o d u c e d
an increase in activity of t he (na t + k÷)-atp ase o f th e heart muscle of guinea pigs. as the
activity of th e (na t + k÷)-atpase is dependent o n th e potassium c o n c e n t r a t i o n and as
cardiac glycosides a r e t h e specific inhibitors
o f this en zy me, th e observed increase in activity m ay be explained by an adaptive response
to an inhibition o f t he atpase. the e n z y m e
activity is expressed as a t u r n o v e r o f substrate
per mg total protein. t her e f or e an increase in

191

activity may be caused by an enhanced turnover (a change of the specific properties of
the enzyme} or by an increase in the a m o u n t
of e n z y m e within total protein.
we investigated the behaviour of the enzymes with different concentrations of digit oxi n as well as with relation to potassium.
the (na t + k÷)-atpase of the heart muscle of
potassium deficient,  xxxd1884xxx -pretreated and
control guinea pigs showed the same kinetic
properties. this suggests t hat the increase in
activity m ay possibly be caused by an increase
in t he a m o u n t of e n z y m e as a result of an
adaptive e n z y m e induction.
