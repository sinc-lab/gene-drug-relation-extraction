abstract
kinetic parameters of the effect of tacrine as a cholinesterase inhibitor have been studied in two different sources: snake venom
(bungarus sindanus) acetylcholinesterase (ache) and human serum  xxxg248xxx  ( xxxg248xxx ). tacrine inhibited both venom
acetylcholinesterase (ache) as well as human serum  xxxg248xxx  ( xxxg248xxx ) in a concentration-dependent manner. kinetic
studies indicated that the nature of inhibition was mixed for both enzymes, i.e. km values increase and vmax decrease with the increase
of the tacrine concentration. the calculated ic50 for snake venom and for human serum were 31 and 25.6 nm, respectively. ki was
observed to be 13 nm for venom acetylcholinesterase (ache) and 12 nm for serum  xxxg248xxx  ( xxxg248xxx ). ki (constant of
ache–asch–tacrine complex into ache–asch complex and tacrine) was estimated to be 20 nm for venom and 10 nm for serum
 xxxg248xxx  ( xxxg248xxx ), while the ␥km (dissociation constant of ache–asch–tacrine complex into ache–tacrine complex
and asch) were 0.086 and 0.147 mm for snake venom ache and serum  xxxg248xxx , respectively. the present results suggest that this
therapeutic agent used for the treatment of alzheimer’s disease can also be considered an inhibitor of snake venom and human
serum  xxxg248xxx . values of ki and ki show that tacrine had more affinity with these enzymes as compared with other
cholinesterases from the literature.

1. introduction
in vertebrates, there are two types of cholinesterases
which are distinguished on the basis of their substrate
specificities, distribution in various tissues and sensitivity toward various inhibitors. they are acetylcholinesterae (ache; e.c. 3.1.1.7) or true cholinesterase/specific cholinesterase and  xxxg248xxx  ( xxxg248xxx ;
e.c. 3.1.1.8) or  xxxg248xxx /non-specific cholinesterase.

acetylcholinesterase is a membrane-bound enzyme
mainly found in the brain, muscles, erythrocytes and
cholinergic neurons. it plays a major role in the regulation of several physiological events [1,2] by hydrolyzing the neurotransmitter acetylcholine in cholinergic
synapses [3,4].  xxxg248xxx  is found in the intestine, liver,
kidney, heart, lung, and serum and plays a major
role in the metabolism of ester containing compounds
[5–7].  xxxg248xxx  can also take the place of
ache in acetylcholine (ach) degradation when acetylcholinesterase is inhibited or absent [8,9].
both ache and  xxxg248xxx  have some homology; 65% of
their amino acid sequence is the same, and they have the

“catalytic triad” for substrate hydrolysis [10]. venom
ache was first reported as a monomeric form [11].
ache occurs at high levels in elapid snakes, except for
mambas. in comparison, all snakes belonging to viperid
or colubrid families lack this type of enzyme in their
venom [12]. elapidae poisoning is well known due to
its high toxicity and death is common in several parts of
the world, particularly in asia [13,14]. probably, death
caused by bungarus poisoning can at least in part be
related to the presence of high quantities of ache in the
venom.
tacrine is a well-known drug used for the treatment of
alzheimer’s disease (ad), which inhibits cholinesterase,
increasing the concentration of acetylcholine in the brain
[15–17]. this increase is believed to be responsible for
the improvement in memory with the use of tacrine. in
addition, tacrine is very effective to inhibit plasma  xxxg248xxx 
[18].
normally, in the healthy brain ache is predominant.
however, in ad brain  xxxg248xxx  activity rises while ache
activity remains unchanged or diminished [19]. therefore, a drug inhibiting both ache and  xxxg248xxx , could have
additive and potential therapeutic benefits. since krait
(bungarus sindanus) venom is rich in ache and human
serum have high amount of  xxxg248xxx , they were selected as
sources of cholinesterases. therefore, it was of interest,
to examine non-specific property and mode of inhibition of venom ache by tacrine and compare the kinetic
behavior with serum  xxxg248xxx , and perhaps, to extend it to
brain  xxxg248xxx .
2. materials and methods
2.1. materials
9-amino-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroarcidine hydrochloride
hydrate (tacrine), dtnb [5,5 -dithiobis (2-nitro-benzoic
acid)], acetylthiocholine iodide (used as a substrate),
bovine  xxxg124xxx  and  xxxd2055xxx  were purchased from sigma chemical (st. louis, mo, usa).
sodium dihydrogen phosphate and disodium hydrogen
phosphate were purchased from neon commercial
ltda, brazil. all other reagents used were of analytical
grade.
2.2. human serum
human serum was obtained from healthy volunteers
(24–33 years old) of both sexes with written consent.
the protocol was approved by the human ethic committee of the federal university of santa maria. none
of the volunteers had a recurrent or a past history of psy-

chiatric illness, any significant medical disorder, or drug,
cigarette or alcohol abuse. none of them had been taking
any previous medication for at least 30 days. from all
participants, 5 ml of blood was collected in vacutainer
tubes, centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 10 min and the serum
was collected, aliquoted and stored at −20 ◦ c for further
use.
2.3. venom
venom from live b. sindanus snakes was squeezed out
manually, lyophilized immediately, aliquoted and stored
at −20 ◦ c for further use.
2.4. cholinesterase assay
cholinesterase activities were determined by the
method of ellman [20] modified by rocha [21]. hydrolysis rates (v) were measured at various acetylthiocholine
(s) concentrations (0.05–1 mm) in 1 ml assay solutions
with 62 mm phosphate buffer, ph 7.5, and 0.2 mm
dtnb at 25 ◦ c. forty microliters of human serum
(700 ␮g of protein) and snake venom (4 ␮g of protein)
were added to the reaction mixture and pre-incubated
for 10 min at 37 ◦ c. about 0.06 mm  xxxd2055xxx  (a
classic selective, potent inhibitor of  xxxg248xxx ) was used in
the ache assay. the hydrolysis was monitored by the
formation of the thiolate dianion of dtnb at 412 nm for
2–3 min at intervals of 10 s using a hitachi 2001 spectrophotometer.
2.5. protein determination
protein was assayed by the method of bradford using
bovine  xxxg124xxx  as a standard [22].
2.6. kinetic determinations
the kinetic parameters of the interaction between
tacrine and cholinesterase were determined using the
lineweaver and burk [23] double reciprocal plot analyzed over a range of acetylthiocholine concentrations
(0.05–1 mm) in the absence and in the presence of
tacrine (12.5–37.5 nm). km values were obtained by
two different estimations, 1/v versus 1/s [23] and v
versus v/s [24,25]. the ki values were obtained using
cornish–bowden plots of s/v versus [i]. ic50 was determined by percentage residual activity versus concentration of tacrine. ki and ␥km values were calculated by
using dixon and lineweaver and burk plots, respectively
[26,23].

2.7. statistical analysis
statistical analysis was performed using one-way
anova, which was followed by post hoc analysis (duncan multiple range test).
3. results
the results showed that tacrine (12.5–37.5 nm) inhibited venom acetylcholinesterase as well as human serum
 xxxg248xxx  in a concentration-dependent
manner. the ic50 , calculated by plotting the percentage
of residual activity versus [i], was 31 nm (fig. 1a)

fig. 2. acetylcholinesterase experiments in the presence and absence
of different concentrations of tacrine. hydrolysis rates (v) were measured at 412 nm by using 0.4 mm substrate (s) concentration in
1 ml assay solutions with 62 mm phosphate buffer (ph 7.4) and
0.2 mm dtnb [5,5-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid)] was pre-incubated
for 10 min before addition of 0.5 mm substrate. all experiments were
repeated at least three times and similar results were obtained. for
venom * p < 0.01 and for serum * p < 0.0003 significantly different from

 xxxg248xxx  (fig. 1b). tacrine inhibited both snake venom
ache and serum  xxxg248xxx  (fig. 2). statistical analysis
revealed a concentration-dependent inhibition of both
enzymes.

(fig. 5) and for serum  xxxg248xxx  (fig. 6) with the help
of the dixon plot. vmaxapp and kiapp were increased
by 36.73–142.17% and 5.88–35.39%, respectively, for
ache values are presented in table 1. while for  xxxg248xxx ,
vmaxapp from 31.79 to 128.66% and kiapp were increased
11.1 to 80.77%, values are presented in table 2.
4. discussion
two ligand interaction sites have been identified in
cholinesterase: an acylation or a-site and a peripheral
binding or p-site. the acylation or a-site is at the base
of the active site gorge and the p-site is at its mouth [27].
the substrate transiently binds to the p-site and forms the
es-complex at the active site, due to its low affinity with
the p-site, contributing to catalytic processes by insuring
that all substrate molecules, which transiently bind to

legend.

the p-site will proceed toward the a-site [27]. binding
of tacrine to the p-site changes the conformation of the
enzyme and sterically blocks the active site or a-site,
substantially reducing the rate at which other molecules

enter or exist in the active site. the increase in kmapp
values indicates that tacrine reduces the affinity of the
substrate with the active site of the enzyme. in the case
of the che–substrate complex, the active site is already
occupied, therefore, in this case, as well, tacrine will bind
at another site, rather than at the active site, the p-site.
for snake venom ki /ki = 1.538 and for human serum
ki /ki = 0.833. the low values of the above ratios also
support the binding of tacrine at the p-site in the case of
the enzyme–substrate complex.
the values of various constants calculated for  xxxg248xxx ,
such as ki , ki , ic50 , ␥km , km , are presented in table 3,
which are lower than the values calculated for snake
venom ache.
in contrast, the mode of inhibition of ache and
 xxxg248xxx  by tacrine was found to be similar, i.e. linear mixed type. others have also reported a mixed
type of inhibition by using tacrine as an inhibitor of
cholinesterase (che) from different origins [28,29].
the ic50 values show that venom acetylcholinesterase
(ache) and human serum  xxxg248xxx  ( xxxg248xxx )
are more sensitive toward tacrine than other acetylcholinesterases except bovine retinal (ache) [17,29]
(table 3). ␥km value in the present study for venom
ache was found to be lower than the values calculated
for other cholinesterases [16,28,29] (table 3). values of
ki and ki show that tacrine demonstrates greater affinity

toward snake venom acetylcholinesterase (ache) and
for human serum  xxxg248xxx  ( xxxg248xxx ) when
compared with other cholinesterases (table 3). in fact,
in these two differences sources the inhibition of acetylcholine hydrolysis by tacrine can promote an elevation
in the acetylcholine levels and in its actions.
in brain,  xxxg248xxx  plays a very important role by act as
supporting enzyme to ache to cleave ach [19,30–37].
furthermore, cholinesterases have non-classical actions
unrelated to their enzymatic function, such as neurotogenesis, synaptogenesis, glial activation, cell adhesion,
cerebral blood flow, the amyloid cascade and tau phosphorolylation [34,35]. in fact, in ad brain the coordinated depletion of ach and ache occur as much as
85%, contrasting with the progressive rise in  xxxg248xxx  that
accompanies an increase in glial cell number [36–38].
it is known that these actions of cholinesterases could
affect the etio-pathogenesis of ad [34,35]. perhaps,
kinetic studies with unselective cholinesterase inhibitors
could help to seek for novel pharmacological and biochemical approaches. in this regard, comparative kinetic
analysis of the action of the unselective cholinesterase
inhibitors, in a rich source of ache, such as snake
venom, and in a rich source of  xxxg248xxx , such as human
serum, could be very useful for these purposes.
in conclusion, a comparison between human serum
and snake venom cholinesterase, human serum butyryl-

cholinesterase ( xxxg248xxx ) are more sensitive to tacrine than
snake venom acetylcholinesterase (ache). we suppose
that this inhibitory potency of tacrine on serum  xxxg248xxx 
could be extended to brain  xxxg248xxx , once they are very
similar. these findings may help in the understanding of
mechanism of actions of the unselective cholinesterase
inhibitors, and perhaps, it can be used in the biochemical
studies with other compounds.
