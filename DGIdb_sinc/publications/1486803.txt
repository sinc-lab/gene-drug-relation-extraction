abstract. two posterior pituitary hormones oxytocin and
 xxxd3495xxx  control the important activities of water
excretion, parturition and lactation. both these hormones are
synthesized as inactive precursors in the hypothalamus along
with their carrier proteins  xxxg1641xxx  and neurophysin ii
respectively and are activated upon transport to posterior pitu-
itary. human genes for both oxytocin- xxxg1641xxx  ( xxxg1641xxx ) and
 xxxd3495xxx -neurophysin ii (arvp) are cloned and

found to be linked on chromosome 20 separated by approxi-
mately 12 kb of intergenic sequences. though  xxxg1641xxx  is not yet
associated with any disease, arvp is linked to the autosomal
dominant disease neurohypophyseal diabetes insipidus (ad-
ndi). we have mapped regionally the  xxxg1641xxx  locus to chromo-
some 20p13 by both radioactive (ish) and fluorescence in situ
hybridization (fish).

 

oxytocin, along with another posterior pituitary hormone
 xxxd3495xxx  plays an active role in the regulation of
water excretion, parturition and lactation (sausville et al.,
1985). both these hormones are synthesized along with their
carrier proteins  xxxg1641xxx  and ii respectively and are called
oxytocin- xxxg1641xxx  ( xxxg1641xxx ) and  xxxd3495xxx -neuro-
physin i] (arvp). the inactive precursors of these two hor-
mones called prepro- xxxg1641xxx  and prepro-ar vp are synthesized in
separate populations of magnocellular neurons in the supraop-
tic and suprachiasmatic nuclei of the hypothalamus, and are
then conveyed to the posterior pituitary (ivell and richter,
1984). the human genes for both  xxxg1641xxx  and arvp have been
cloned and comparison of their sequences revealed an identical
exon-intron structure (sausville et al., 1985). similar observa-
tions with regard to these two genes from rat and bovine species
suggested the possibility that the two genes might have a com-
mon evolutionary origin (ivell and richter, 1984; ruppert et al.,
1984). the contiguous genes  xxxg1641xxx  and arvp are physically
linked within 12 kb in the human genome and are transcribed
from opposite strands (sausville et al., 1985). it is also reported
that the corresponding rat genes are linked by 10 kb of inter-
genic sequences that contain an unusual 6.4 kb long inter-
spersed repeated element (line) with seven long open reading
frames on both strands (schmitz et al., 1991). it is not known
whether the human  xxxg1641xxx /arvp gene complex is also inter-

supported in part by funds from deutsche forschungsgemeinschaft and fellowship
from daad (to g.r.).

tional activity.

the human precursor prepro- xxxg1641xxx  consists of a single poly-
peptide chain with a secretory signal sequence, the nonapeptide
oxytocin, followed by the carrier protein  xxxg1641xxx . this
structure is identical to the precursor for prepro-arvp, wherein
oxytocin and  xxxg1641xxx  are replaced by arginine-vasopres-
sin and neurophysin ii. one major difference between the two is
the presence of an additional peptide of glycoprotein nature at
the carboxy-terminal in arvp, whose function is not yet known
(sausville et al., 1985). the human  xxxg1641xxx  gene contains 3 exons
and 2 introns and the first exon encodes the secretory signal
peptide and the hormone oxytocin, while the entire second exon
encodes for the carrier protein  xxxg1641xxx  (sausville et al.,
1985).

both these two genes  xxxg1641xxx  and arvp have been assigned to
human chromosome 20 (riddell et al., 1985). though arvp
has been implicated in the autosomal dominant disease neuro-
hypophyseal diabetes insipidus (ad-ndi) by linkage studies
(repaske et al., 1990),  xxxg1641xxx  has not been associated with any
disease so far.

here, we report the regional localization of human  xxxg1641xxx  to
chromosome 20p13 using both radioactive (ish) and fluores-
cence in situ hybridization (fish).

materials and methods

radioactive in situ hybridization was carried out with a 1.5-kb ecori/
bamhi fragment cloned in pbr322. this genomic fragment contained all three
exons and two introns of  xxxg1641xxx . the probe was labeled by random priming using
the 5h nucleotides  xxxd1148xxx , dttp and dctp to a specific activity of 8.3 x
107 cpm/ug of dna. prometaphase chromosomes were prepared by the meth-

od of rybak et al. (1982) with slight modifications, hybridization and posthy-
bridization washes were carried out as described earlier (rao et al., 1991).
for fish, the same probe was labeled by nick translation using biotin-
11-dutp (sigma) and the labeled probe (100 ng) was dissolved in 10 pl of
hybridization mixture containing 5 jig of sonicated human placental dna
and 20 yg of salmon sperm dna, formamide and 10 jl of master mix (20%
dextran sulphate and 2 x ssc). probe denaturation was done at 95°c for
5 min and the repetitive sequences were allowed to preanneal at 37°c for
15 min, chromosome preparations were denatured in 70% formamide/2 x
ssc at 65°c for 4.5 min, hybridization was performed at 37 °c overnight.
posthybridization washes included 3 x 5 min in 50% formamide/2 x ssc, 5 x
2 min in 2 x ssc, both at 42 °c; 3 x 5 min in 0.1 x ssc at 65 °c followed by
1 x 5 min in 4 x ssc/tween 20 at 42 °c and incubation with 5% nonfat dry
milk/4 x ssc at room temperature for 10 min. detection of the probe was
carried out as per the standardized method (lichter et al, 1988). signals were
amplified twice by using the biotinylated goat anti-avidin (vector). after
counterstaining with  xxxd3027xxx  the slides were mounted in the anti-
fade solution containing 90% glycerol, 10% pbs, | mg/ml phenylendiamine.
analysis of the metaphases was carried out on a zeiss axiophot fluorescence
microscope with filter combinations 9 and 15. scotch 640t film was used to
take representative photographs. in the first part of the study slides were
simultaneously hybridized with a 3.1-kb hindiii fragment (nucleotides 230-
3370) of the semenogelin i gene (semg), recently mapped to 20q12—>q31.1
(ulvsbiick et al., 1992), for identifying chromosome 20. in a second fish

experiment, slides were destained overnight in bn buffer (0.1 m nahco3.
ph 8/0.05% tween 20), and chromosomes were q-banded using standard
method and representative metaphases were analyzed for the assignment of
hybridization signals to chromosome bands.

results and discussion

analysis of 100 metaphases after ish revealed a total of 143
silver grains (1.43 grains/metaphase). of these, 27 (18.9%) were
concentrated on chromosome 20 (fig. 1). based on the relative
length/dna content a total of only 3.3 (2.3%) grains were
expected on this chromosome (p < 0.001). though the remain-
ing grains are more or less randomly distributed on all other
chromosomes, chromosome 11 also showed higher than ex-
pected number of grains (exp = 6.6; obs = 15; p < 0.05), how-
ever, no noticeable cluster was seen on chromosome ! |, as these
grains are evenly distributed all along the chromosome length
(fig. 1). on chromosome 20, on the other hand, a large cluster of
10 grains (37%) was seen at the distal 20p13 band (fig. 2), thus
suggesting that  xxxg1641xxx  is localized to chromosome 20p13.

 
human  xxxg1641xxx  on chromosome 20p13

clear fish signals were seen at the terminal portion on the
short arm of an f group chromosome. simultaneous hybridiza-
tion of another probe semg, already localized on the long arm
of chromosome 20q12— 13.1 (ulvsbiick et al., 1992) revealed
both hybridization signals on the same chromosome, thereby
confirming the identity of chromosome 20 (fig. 3). in seven out
of ten q-banded metaphases with signals on chromosome 20,
the hybridization signal was seen at the distal 20p13 band
(fig. 2), thus confirming the localization by ish.

the map position of  xxxg1641xxx  was determined by length mea-
surements from a set of 24 selected chromosomes 20 with sig-
 xxxd3215xxx . the map position of  xxxg1641xxx  is expressed in terms of frac-
tional length-pter (fl-pter) (lichter et al., 1990), with a mean

273

fl-pter value of 0.10 + 0.07. our physical assignment of the
 xxxg1641xxx  locus to chromosome 20p13 by ish and fish is in agree-
ment with data from linkage analysis (summar et al., 1990). the
arvp/ xxxg1641xxx  loci have been mapped on the short arm of chro-
mosome 20 at about 15m distal to the locus for d20s5 at
20p12 (goodfellow et al., 1987) and close to the  xxxg1722xxx 
locus (summar et al., 1990).
