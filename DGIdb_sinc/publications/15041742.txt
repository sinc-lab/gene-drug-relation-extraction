simvastatin and pravastatin are inhibitors of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coa reductase, and are used as antihypercholesterolemia drugs.
simvastatin, but not pravastatin, binds to the inserted domain of
leukocyte function antigen (lfa)-1 and inhibits the function of lfa-1,
including adhesion and costimulation of lymphocytes. epstein–barr
virus (ebv)-transformed lymphoblastoid cell lines (lcls) express high
levels of lfa-1 on their surface and grow in tight clumps. here we
show that simvastatin (2 ␮m) inhibits clump formation and induces
apoptosis of ebv-transformed lcls. the apoptosis-inducing effect of
simvastatin depends on binding to the inserted domain of lfa-1.
simvastatin, but not pravastatin, dissociates ebv latent membrane
protein 1 from lipid rafts of lcls, resulting in down-regulation of
nuclear factor ␬b activity and induction of apoptosis. analysis of
multiple ebv-positive and -negative cell lines indicated that both
lfa-1 and ebv latent membrane protein 1 expression were required
for simvastatin’s effects. administration of simvastatin to severe
combined immunodeficiency mice followed by inoculation with lcls
resulted in delayed development of ebv lymphomas and prolonged
survival of animals. to our knowledge, this is the first report in which
a drug that targets lfa-1 has been used to treat b cell lymphoma.
these data suggest that simvastatin may have promise for treatment
or prevention of ebv-associated lymphomas that occur in immunocompromised persons.

i

nfection of primary b cells with epstein–barr virus (ebv) results
in transformation with growth of the cells in tight clumps and
immortalization of the cells. these immortalized b cells have an
immunoblastic morphology and express each of the ebv nuclear
antigens (ebnas) and latent membrane proteins (lmps) (1, 2).
ebna-2 is a transactivator that up-regulates expression of cellular
genes and lmps. lmp-1 is an oncoprotein that constitutively
activates nuclear factor ␬b (nf-␬b) to induce b cell proliferation
(3). lmp-1 also induces expression of adhesion molecules leukocyte function antigen (lfa)-1,  xxxg395xxx , and intercellular adhesion
molecule 1 (icam-1) on the surface of ebv-transformed b cells
(4, 5). the high level expression of adhesion molecules contributes
to clumping of ebv-infected b cells in vitro (6).
ebv-associated immunoblastic lymphomas occur in immunocompromised patients such as those with aids or transplant
recipients (7, 8). because these ebv-associated immunoblastic
lymphomas express each of the ebnas and lmps (8) that induce
proliferation of b cells, the virus is thought to be directly responsible
for the pathogenesis of these tumors (3). lmp-1 in ebv-associated
lymphoma cells binds to  xxxg2296xxx  receptor-associated
factors, and the tumors show activation of nf-␬b (9). many
immunocompromised patients with ebv-associated immunoblastic lymphoma have tumors at extranodal sites such as the brain,
lung, or gastrointestinal tract. the high-level expression of lfa-1
and other cellular adhesion molecules in these tumors may contribute to their extranodal location (10). the prognosis of these
lymphomas is often poor for patients with irreversible immunosuppression, and treatment options are limited.
simvastatin is a member of the statin family of drugs that inhibit
3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coa reductase (11). statins lower

plasma cholesterol levels, resulting in reduction of the risk of
cardiovascular disease (12). weitz-schmidt et al. (13) demonstrated
that certain statins, including simvastatin and lovastatin, bind to the
i (inserted) domain of lfa-1 and inhibit its function (13). in
contrast, other statins such as pravastatin do not bind to lfa-1.
lfa-1 is expressed on the surface of various leukocytes and plays
an important role in cell adhesion and costimulation of t cells. the
i domain of lfa-1 is the binding site for icam-1, a ligand of
lfa-1 (14, 15). the binding of simvastatin or lovastatin to the
lfa-1 i domain induces a conformational change in lfa-1,
resulting in inhibition of the interaction of lfa-1 with icam-1
(13). as a result of their binding to lfa-1, these statins inhibit the
costimulatory activity of lfa-1 and suppress the inflammatory
response in a murine model of peritonitis (13).
here, we investigate the ability of simvastatin to inhibit ebvpositive b cell proliferation. because simvastatin binds to and
inhibits the function of lfa-1, we postulated that the drug would
inhibit the growth of these cells both in vitro and in vivo. inoculation
of ebv-transformed lymphoblastoid cell lines (lcls) into severe
combined immunodeficiency (scid) mice results in the formation
of ebv-associated immunoblastic lymphomas that contain ebv
genomes and express ebnas, lmps, and adhesion molecules
including lfa-1 (16, 17). in the present study, we treated ebvtransformed lcls in vitro with simvastatin, and administered the
drug and inoculated scid mice with lcls to assess development
of b cell lymphomas.

nuclear extraction and electrophoretic mobility-shift assays. nuclear
extracts were prepared from 1 ⫻ 107 cells as described (28).
activation of nf-␬b was determined by using 5 ␮g of nuclear
extract in the gel-shift assay system (promega) according to the
manufacturer’s instructions.
apoptosis assays. dna fragmentation by apoptosis was detected by

pi staining as described (29). terminal deoxytransferase-mediated
dutp nick end labeling (tunel) assays were performed by using
the in situ cell death detection kit (roche molecular biochemicals)
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. dna ladder formation was performed by extracting dna from cells with the genomic
dna purification kit (gentra systems), and electrophoresis was
performed.

animal experiments.  xxxd3204xxx  (zocor, merck) were

mixed with mouse food at a ratio of 160 mg of simvastatin per 65 g
of powdered food. untreated animals received powdered food
without simvastatin. lcls (0.25 ⫻ 106, 1 ⫻ 106, or 4 ⫻ 106) were
inoculated i.p. into 8-week-old scid mice. simvastatin was given
either 3 days before (pretreatment group) or 7 days after (treatment
group) inoculation of cells and continued until 4–6 weeks after
inoculation. thereafter, food without simvastatin was given to all
mice, because of the side effects of prolonged high-dose simvastatin. all dead mice were autopsied and examined for the presence
of lymphomas.
results
simvastatin inhibits clump formation and induces apoptosis of lcls.

lcls and burkitt lymphoma cells that express each of the ebnas,
lmps, and lfa-1 grow in tight clumps. binding of anti-lfa-1
antibody ts1兾22 to the i domain of lfa-1 inhibits clumping of
phorbol  xxxd2681xxx  acetate-stimulated lcls after 18 h (6). to
determine whether simvastatin affects clumping of unstimulated
lcls, we treated an lcl (12a1) with various concentrations of the
drug. five days after the addition of simvastatin, lcl clumps broke
apart in wells treated with ⱖ2 ␮m simvastatin, whereas clumps
remained in wells treated with ⱕ1 ␮m simvastatin (fig. 1a).
dissociation of clumps was also observed in other lcls (6b10 and
295h) and in mutu-3 cells (data not shown). cell viability assays
were performed on various cell lines expressing different levels of
lfa-1, icam-1, and lmp-1 (table 1 and fig. 5, which is published
as supporting information on the pnas web site). xtt cell
proliferation assays showed that simvastatin decreased the number
of viable cells in a dose-dependent manner (fig. 1b). a loss in
viability of lcls was induced by 0.5 ␮m simvastatin, whereas ⱖ2
␮m simvastatin was required to reduce viability of other cells.
trypan blue staining showed that lcls 12a1 and 295h had ⬎50%
reduction in viability with 2 ␮m simvastatin, whereas akata and
p3hr-1 cells required higher concentrations of the drug (4 ␮m) to
achieve ⬎50% reduction in viability (fig. 1c). the number of dead
cells began to increase 5 days after addition of simvastatin at the
time when clumps started to dissociate. pi staining followed by flow
cytometry was also used to determine cell viability with 2 ␮m
simvastatin. cells expressing lmp-1 such as lcls (12a1, 6b10, and
295h) and mutu-3 showed low (⬍50%) viability after culture in 2
␮m simvastatin for 7 days (fig. 1d). thus, incubation of cells with
2 ␮m simvastatin for 5 days inhibits clump formation and induces
death in cells expressing lmp-1 (table 1).
some statins induce apoptosis of certain tumor cells in vitro (30).
pi staining showed that treatment of lcls with simvastatin for 5
days induced a dose-dependent increase in fragmented dna that
was smaller than g0–g1 dna (2n), indicative of apoptosis (29)
(fig. 1e). tunel assay confirmed that simvastatin induced dna
fragmentation in lcls (fig. 1f). gel electrophoresis showed that
simvastatin induced dna fragment in lcls resulting in formation
of a dna ladder (fig. 1g). thus, simvastatin induces apoptosis in
lcls.

fig. 2. apoptosis-inducing effect of simvastatin depends on binding to the
i domain of lfa-1. (a and b) xtt cell proliferation assay was performed for
lcls 12a1 (a) and 6b10 (b) in the presence of simvastatin or pravastatin after
5 days. (c) cell viability was assayed by trypan blue staining for lcl 12a1 in the
presence of anti-lfa-1 antibody ts1兾22, which recognizes the i domain of
lfa-1, or an isotype control antibody for 7 days. (d) cell viability was measured
by trypan blue staining of lcls 12a1 and 295h cultured with soluble icam-1
(sicam-1) for 7 days. (e) lcl 12a1 was cultured with anti-lfa-1 (ts1兾22) or
isotype control antibody for 1 h, simvastatin (2 ␮m) or no compound was
added, and the cells were cultured for 7 days. cell clumping is reduced with
isotype control antibody and simvastatin (upper) but not with anti-lfa-1
antibody and simvastatin (lower). (f) cell viability was assayed by trypan blue
staining of lcls cultured with an anti-lfa-1 or isotype control antibody. error
bars indicate standard deviations of three separate experiments.

the apoptosis-inducing effect is specific for simvastatin and depends
on binding to the i domain of lfa-1. to determine whether loss of

cell viability of lcls occurs with a statin with different binding
properties than simvastatin, lcls were incubated with pravastatin,
which does not bind to lfa-1 (13). pravastatin had little effect on
viability of lcl 12a1 or 6b10 (fig. 2 a and b). anti-lfa-1
monoclonal antibody ts1兾22 and soluble icam-1 (sicam-1) bind
to the i domain of lfa-1 (26, 31), which is the site on lfa-1
targeted by simvastatin (13). anti-lfa-1 ts1兾22 antibody bound
to lfa-1 on the cell surface at a 1:100 dilution by flow cytometry
(fig. 5); however, the antibody did not affect viability of 12a1 cells
at concentrations up to 1:16 (fig. 2c). sicam-1 used at concentrations (5 ␮g兾ml) that block rhinovirus infection (31) did not affect
viability of lcls 12a1 and 295h (fig. 2d). thus, antibody or
another ligand that binds to the i domain of lfa-1 does not induce
death of lcls.
katano et al.

antibody to lfa-1 (ts1兾22) has been shown to induce signal
transduction in lymphocytes (32). therefore, pretreatment of lcls
with the antibody might inhibit the effects of simvastatin. pretreatment of cells with anti-lfa-1 antibody ts1兾22 blocked the ability
of simvastatin to dissociate clumps of lcls (fig. 2e) and to reduce
viability of lcls (fig. 2f).
simvastatin, but not pravastatin, dissociates lmp-1 from lipid rafts
and reduces activation of nf-␬b. in vitro assays indicate that cho-

 xxxd3014xxx  depletion by high doses of statins disrupts lipid rafts and
alters the localization and function of proteins in lipid rafts on the
cell membrane (33–35). ebv lmp-1 localizes in lipid rafts and
constitutively activates nf-␬b via  xxxg2296xxx  receptorassociated factors (3, 27, 36). therefore, we postulated that simvastatin may affect localization of lmp-1 in lipid rafts and impair
signal transduction by lmp-1. to determine whether simvastatin
alters localization of lmp-1, we treated lcls with simvastatin and
performed immunofluorescence assays for the viral protein. lmp-1
localized to large punctate structures in lcls in the absence of
simvastatin (fig. 3a). after treatment with simvastatin for 3 or 7
days, lmp-1 showed a fine granular pattern in most of the cells that
was much fainter and more diffuse than in untreated cells. in
contrast, lmp-1 maintained its large punctate structures in cells
treated with pravastatin. to further examine the effect of statins on
lmp-1 localization, cell extracts were fractionated by using centrifugation and floatation in sucrose gradients (27). lyn localizes to
lipid rafts, whereas cd71 is in the soluble fraction (27). immunoblotting showed that lipid raft fractions (fractions 3 and 4) contained the highest concentrations of lmp-1 in untreated or pravastatin-treated lcls. at 2 ␮ m simvastatin, the highest
concentrations of lmp-1 shifted to soluble fractions (fractions
7–12), but lyn remained in lipid rafts (fractions 3 and 4) (fig. 3b).
quantitative analysis showed that 47% of lmp-1 was localized in
lipid rafts of untreated cells; after treatment with simvastatin for 3
days, only 7% of lmp-1 was located in rafts. these data indicate
that simvastatin, but not pravastatin, alters the localization of
lmp-1 in the cell and dissociates lmp-1 from lipid rafts.
each of the lcls used in the present study showed constitutive
activation of nf-␬b (fig. 5). electrophoretic mobility-shift assays
showed that treatment of lcls with simvastatin (2 ␮m or 4 ␮m)
for 3 days reduced the level of activated nf-␬b, whereas pravastatin
(8 ␮m) did not reduce nf-␬b (fig. 3c). cell viability at 3 days
ranged from 80–90% in cells treated with either statin or in
untreated cells. because inhibition of nf-␬b induces apoptosis of
lcls (28), our results suggest that reduction of nf-␬b by simvastatin results in induction of apoptosis in lcls.
simvastatin delays the onset of ebv lymphomas and prolongs survival in scid mice inoculated with ebv-transformed lcls. because

two animals receiving 4 ⫻ 106 12a1 and simvastatin died or were sacrificed because of simvastatin side effects. these included severe weight loss, hunched body,
or red swollen eyes. autopsies showed no evidence of ascites or lymphomas in these mice and they were not included in the table and were excluded from the
analysis.

not receive simvastatin. four or 6 weeks later, simvastatin was
discontinued because of side effects from the drug (table 2) and
mice were followed for development of tumors. seven weeks after
inoculation with lcls, 80% of mice in the control group that
received 0.25 ⫻ 106 cells developed ascites, whereas none of the
animals treated with simvastatin that received the same number of
cells had ascites (fig. 4a). nine weeks after inoculation, ⬎70% of
the control mice were dead of lymphoma, whereas all mice treated
with simvastatin that received the same number of cells were alive,
although a few had ascites. mice pretreated with simvastatin that
received different doses of lcls all survived significantly longer
compared to mice that did not receive the drug (table 2). at
autopsy all of these control mice had immunoblastic lymphomas
(fig. 4a). flow cytometry showed that expression of lfa-1 in
tumor cell ascites was reduced in mice treated with simvastatin
compared with mice that did not receive the drug (data not shown).
in a separate series of experiments using lcl 6b10, we compared
mice that received simvastatin 3 days before inoculation with lcls
(pretreatment group) with mice that received the drug 7 days after
inoculation (treatment group). mice in the pretreatment group
survived significantly longer (p ⬍ 0.04) compared with animals in
the control group; however, the difference in survival was not
significant for animals in the treatment group versus the control
group (p ⫽ 0.2135) (table 2 and fig. 4b).
discussion
we have shown that simvastatin induces cell death of ebvtransformed lcls in vitro and prolongs survival of scid mice with
ebv lymphomas. this effect was seen with simvastatin, which binds
to lfa-1, but not with pravastatin, which does not bind to lfa-1.
simvastatin dissociated lmp-1 from lipid rafts, inhibited nf-␬b
activation, and induced apoptosis in lcls. expression of lmp-1
and lfa-1 and constitutive nf-␬b activation were critical for
simvastatin-induced death of lcls (table 1). to our knowledge,
this is the first report in which a drug that targets lfa-1 has been
used to treat b cell lymphoma.
apoptosis of lcls occurred after 5–7 days of treatment with
simvastatin. during the first 2 days of treatment there was no
change in the morphology or viability of lcls. however, 3 days
after addition of simvastatin, lcl clumps became smaller, but the
cells were still viable. at 5 days most clumps had dissociated and
apoptosis was detected; at day 7 ⬎80% of the cells were dead. we
postulate that the relatively long time required for simvastatin to
induce cell death is likely due to initiation of several processes in the
cell. first, simvastatin blocks the binding of icam-1 to the i domain
of lfa-1. lfa-1 binding to icam-1 on t cells induces cell
proliferation (37), and because simvastatin inhibits lfa-1 binding

appearance of mice at 45 days after inoculation. the mouse that did not
receive simvastatin (upper left, lower mouse) has ascites, but the simvastatintreated mouse (upper mouse) has no ascites. the simvastatin-treated mouse
(upper right) has no ascites or solid tumors, whereas the untreated mouse
(lower right) has ascites (arrows) and solid tumors (arrowheads). immunoblastic lymphoma is present in the mouse not treated with simvastatin (lower
left). (b) kaplan–meier survival curves of scid mice that were inoculated with
1.0 ⫻ 106 6b10 lcls. mice were pretreated with simvastatin beginning 3 days
before inoculation with cells (blue circles), treated with drug beginning 7 days
after inoculation with cells (red triangles), or not treated with drug (squares).

katano et al.

of lovastatin have shown partial responses in some patients with
cancer (30). simvastatin had an adjuvant effect in some, but not all,
studies when given with other antitumor drugs (40, 41). the plasma
levels of statins achieved in humans in clinical trials (2.32 ⫾ 1.27 ␮m
at peak concentration) (45) were comparable to the concentration
of simvastatin (2 ␮m) that induced apoptosis of ebv-transformed
lcls in vitro and did not result in severe drug toxicity in the patients
(30). although a high dose of simvastatin was used in mice in this
study (250 mg/kg兾day), administration of simvastatin to mice at
100–400 mg/kg兾day resulted in mean plasma drug levels about four
to eight times higher than the mean human plasma drug level after
an 80-mg oral dose, which is the maximum dose for cholesterollowering effects (46). mice metabolize simvastatin much more
rapidly than humans and therefore lower doses might be effective
in humans.
simvastatin, or other statins that block lfa-1 binding to
icam-1, may have a role in the treatment of ebv-associated
immunoblastic lymphomas that occur in immunocompromised
persons. these tumor express high levels of lfa-1 (4) and lmp-1
(47) and have constitutive activation of nf-␬b in vivo (9). simvastatin might be used in combination with other agents for these
patients. simvastatin has not been reported to cause suppression of
bone marrow function, and therefore it might not add to the
hematopoietic toxicity that often occurs with other chemotherapeutic agents used to treat ebv-associated lymphomas. recently
we have found that lovastatin and atorvastatin also kill lcls at
similar concentrations as simvastatin (h.k. and j.i.c., unpublished
results). further studies are needed to assess the use of statins as
adjunctive therapy for ebv-associated lymphomas in immunocompromised persons.

to its receptor, the proliferation signal from lfa-1 is impaired by
simvastatin. second, simvastatin displaces ebv lmp-1 from lipid
rafts and prevents signaling by the viral protein. lmp-1 recruits
 xxxg2296xxx  receptor-associated factor 3 to lipid rafts and
localization of lmp-1 to rafts activates nf-␬b (36). three days
after treatment of lcls with simvastatin, lmp-1 was dissociated
from rafts and activation of nk-␬b was inhibited in nuclear extracts
from the cells. because constitutive activation of nf-␬b is required
for growth of lcls (28), simvastatin may induce apoptosis by
turning off activation of nf-␬b in these cells. this hypothesis is
consistent with our observations that 2 ␮m simvastatin induced
⬎50% death only in cells that expressed lmp-1 in which nf-␬b was
constitutively activated (table 1). although lfa-1 also localizes in
lipid rafts of stimulated t cells (38) and simvastatin might have an
effect on lfa-1, we did not observe a reduction in lfa-1 levels
after treatment of lcls with simvastatin in vitro (unpublished
data). we did, however, note down-regulation of lfa-1 in ebvtransformed b cells in mice after treatment for 4–6 weeks. it is
uncertain whether long-term simvastatin treatment in vivo resulted
in a direct down-regulation of lfa-1 expression, or whether lower
(trough) levels of simvastatin in serum may have allowed for
selection and expansion of rare ebv-transformed b cells with low
lfa-1 expression on their surface.
simvastatin prolonged survival in scid mice inoculated with
ebv-transformed lcls. statins have previously been reported to
have antitumor effects; however, these effects occurred at higher
levels of drug (5–400 ␮m) (39–41) than were used in our study. in
addition, other studies of statins showed that the effects were not
specific for individual cell types and were seen with a wide variety
of tumors both in vitro and in animal models (39–44). clinical trials
