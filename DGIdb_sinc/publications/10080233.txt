castilho, v. m., v. avanzi and m. l. brandão. antinociception elicited by aversive stimulation of the inferior colliculus. pharmacol biochem behav 62(3) 425–431, 1999.—we have shown that the inferior colliculus is involved in the integration of defensive reactions. electrical and chemical stimulation of this structure elicits fear and escape
behavior, expressed respectively by immobility (freezing) and wild running, followed by jumps. in this study, we analyzed
whether the defensive behavior integrated at this level of the midbrain tectum is also followed by antinociception and its
chemical mediation. in addition, we further addressed whether or not the aversive states and the stress-induced analgesia
share the same neural substrates in the inferior colliculus. to this end, animals chronically implanted with a chemitrode, an
electrode glued to a guide cannula, in the inferior colliculus were injected with naltrexone,  xxxd2621xxx ,  xxxd2419xxx , and midazolam. the animals were submitted to gradual increases in the electrical stimulation of the inferior colliculus, which allowed the measurement of the thresholds for aversive responses—vigilance, freezing, and escape. following the induction of
the aversive behavioral responses the animals were submitted to the tail-flick test. the results obtained show that midazolam
was the only treatment that changed the aversive thresholds. on the other hand, while naltrexone and midazolam did not affect the fear-induced analgesia, it was inhibited by microinjections of the serotonergic blockers,  xxxd2621xxx  and  xxxd2419xxx .
these results emphasize previous data demonstrating the nonopioid nature of the unconditioned analgesia to brain-aversive
stimulation. because  xxxd2621xxx  is a nonspecific antagonist of 5-ht receptors, and  xxxd2419xxx  acts with a high degree of specificity at 5-ht2/ xxxg1115xxx  receptors, the present results suggest that activation of 5-ht2/ xxxg1115xxx  receptors may be implicated in the
antinociception induced by stimulation of the inferior colliculus. moreover, the present data also indicate that aversive reactions
and analgesia from inferior colliculus stimulation can be pharmacologically dissociated. © 1999 elsevier science inc.

on the control of defensive and affective behaviors (13–
15,47,49).
the nonopioid nature of the mechanisms involved in the
integration of the aversive states and analgesia have also been
demonstrated (11,12,36,41,49). studies on these neural and
hormonal mechanisms provide evidence for the involvement
of corticotrophins, corticosterone, and serotonin (5-ht) in
some kinds of antinociception (2,22,23,31,32,46,50). recently,
we presented evidence that the analgesia associated with the
fear induced by electrical and chemical stimulation of the
dpag is of a nonopiod nature, and that serotonergic mechanisms could be involved in these processes (11,12). in the
present work, we examine the occurrence of fear-induced analgesia elicited by electrical stimulation of the inferior colliculus at three aversive thresholds—vigilance, freezing, and escape—and the chemical nature of this antinociception. taking
into account that the aversive reactions and antinociception

many investigations have reported that stimulation of some
midbrain tectum structures, such as the dorsal periaqueductal
grey matter (dpag), deep layers of the superior colliculus,
and inferior colliculus, elicit—in a progressive manner—aversive responses characterized by arousal, freezing, and escape
behavior (5,7,16,18,21,39,48). it has also been shown that defensive reactions produced by electrical stimulation of these
structures is generally accompanied by antinociception (11,
12,14,15,44,47). in general, it is believed that the analgesia and
autonomic manifestations observed in these situations occur
to give support to the expression of fear-related behaviors
(6,11,12,25). electrical stimulation of midbrain, areas such as
the periaqueductal gray, elicits these antinociceptive processes through activation of pathways that inhibit sensitive
neurons in the spinal cord (1,2,28,48,51). this antinociceptive
system can also be activated by a variety of external or environmental nociceptive stimuli exerting an important function

can be dissociated by pretreatment with benzodiazepines in
the dpag and amygdaloid complex, and that the neural substrate subserving the defense reaction and nociception in
these structures are independent (6,8,25,33,40), we also examined whether or not they share the same neural substrates at
the level of the inferior colliculus. to this end, we studied the
effects of microinjections into the inferior colliculus of midazolam (a benzodiazepine compound), naltrexone (an opioid
antagonist),  xxxd2621xxx  (a nonselective 5-ht antagonist),
and  xxxd2419xxx  (a selective 5-ht2 antagonist) on the behavioral responses and antinociception elicited by electrical stimulation of this brainstem structure.

nociceptive testing
one week after surgery, all rats were tested for antinociception behavior, i.e., a reduction of the responsiveness to noxious stimuli, using the tail-flick test. each animal was placed in
an acrylic tube and its tail laid across a nichrome wire coil that
was then heated by the passage of an electric current. the current raised the temperature of the coil at the rate of 98 c/s. a
small adjustment of the current was made if necessary at the
beginning of the experiment to obtain three consecutive baseline tail-flick latencies (tfl), between 2.5 and 3.5 s. if at any
time the animal failed to flick its tail within 6 s, the tail was removed from the coil to prevent damage to the skin. each tfl
was normalized by an index of analgesia (ia) using the formula:
( tfl test ) – ( tfl control )
ia = --------------------------------------------------------6 – ( tflcontrol )

method

subjects
male wistar rats weighing 210–240 g from the animal
house of the campus of ribeirão preto at the university of
são paulo were used. these animals were housed in individual plexiglas-walled cages and given free access to food and
water throughout the experiment.

three baselines of tail-flick latencies were taken at 3-min
intervals. tfl were also taken following aversive reactions induced by electrical stimulation of the inferior colliculus at the
vigilance, freezing, and escape thresholds.
measurement of aversive thresholds

surgery
the animals were anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital
(45 mg/kg, ip) and fixed in a stereotaxic frame (david kopf,
tujunga, ca). a chemitrode made of a stainless steel guide
cannula (o.d. 0.6 mm, i.d. 0.4 mm) glued to a brain electrode
was implanted in the midbrain, aimed at the inferior colliculus. the electrode was made of stainless steel wire, 160 mm in
diameter, insulated except at the cross-section of the tip
reaching 1 mm below the lower end of the cannula. the upper
incisor bar was set at 3.3 mm below the interaural line so that
the skull was horizontal between bregma and lambda. the
chemitrode was introduced vertically using the following coordinates with the lambda serving as the reference for each
plane: anteroposterior, 20.9 mm; mediolateral, 1.2 mm; and
dorsoventral, 4.5 mm (42). the chemitrode was fixed to the
skull by means of acrylic resin and three stainless steel screws.
the electrode wire was connected to a male pin, parallel to
the outer end of the cannula. together they could be plugged
into an amphenol socket at the end of a flexible electrical cable and used for brain stimulation. at the end of the surgery
each guide cannula was sealed with a stainless steel wire to
protect it from congestion.

immediately after three control tail-flick latencies were
taken the rats were placed in an arena (circular enclosure, 60
cm in diameter and 50 cm high) with the floor divided in 12
sections. this arena was situated in an experimental compartment illuminated with a 40-w fluorescent lamp (350 lx at the
arena floor level). the rats were allowed a 10-min period of
habituation in the enclosure at the beginning of each experimental procedure. afterwards, three tail-flick tests were applied to assess the animal reactiveness to noxious stimuli. immediately thereafter the brain was electrically stimulated by
means of a sinewave stimulator. the stimulation current was
monitored by measuring the voltage drop across a 1-k resistor
(ac, 60 hz, 15 s). it was presented at 1-min intervals with the
current intensity increasing by steps of 5 ma (rms) for measurement of the aversive thresholds. each aversive threshold
was operationally defined as the lowest intensity producing
the given behavior in two consecutive series of electrical stimulation of the inferior colliculus. “alert” was defined as the
arrest of any ongoing behavior. the freezing threshold was
defined by the occurrence of immobility accompanied by at
least two of the following autonomic reactions: urination, defecation, piloerection, or exophthalmus. the escape threshold

antinociception and aversive stimulation
was defined by the current intensity produced running (gallop) or jumping. animals with an escape threshold above 200
ma (peak-to-peak) were discarded from the experiment.
procedure
each animal was habituated to the experimental procedure for 10 min. the procedure consisted of the measurement
of three tfl baseline latencies followed by the determination
of the aversive thresholds (alert, freezing, and escape), being
each one followed immediately by the subsequent tail-flick
test. the effects of microinjections into inferior colliculus
were evaluated 15 min later. independent groups of animals
were used for each group (control, naltrexone,  xxxd2621xxx ,
 xxxd2419xxx , and midazolam). for each one of these groups,
the animals were submitted to the electrical stimulation procedure and to the tail-flick test again 15 min after drug or saline administration into the inferior colliculus (table 1).
injection procedures
the animals were gently wrapped in a cloth, hand held,
and a thin dental needle (o.d., 0.3 mm) was introduced though
the guide cannula until its lower end was 1 mm below the
guide cannula, reaching the same depth as the electrode tip.
the injection needle was linked to a 2-ml hamilton syringe by
means of a polyethylene tubing. a volume of 0.2 ml was injected for 20 s, and the displacement of an air bubble inside
the polyethylene (pe-10) catheter connecting the syringe needle to the intracerebral needle was used to monitor the microinjection. the effects of drug microinjections were then evaluated on the analgesia induced by electrical stimulation of the
mesencephalic tectum.
drugs
 xxxd2621xxx  bimaleate (rbi), naltrexone hidrochloride
(sigma),  xxxd2419xxx  (rbi), and midazolam maleate
(roche) were each dissolved in physiological saline (0.9%)
shortly before use. physiological saline also served as vehicle
control. the doses used were: 5 nmol (2.5 mg) of  xxxd2621xxx , 15 nmol (7.5 mg) of  xxxd2419xxx , 13 nmol (5.0 mg) of naltrexone, and 40 nmol (16 mg) of midazolam.

analysis was also performed considering condition as the first
factor and treatment as the second factor for each aversive
threshold (alert, freezing, and escape). factors found to be
significant were tested with newman–keuls comparisons. the
number of animals per group was 13 for  xxxd2621xxx , 12 for
 xxxd2419xxx , 12 for naltrexone, and 8 for midazolam and 12 for
saline (control).
results

electrical stimulation of the sites studied in this work induced escape reactions that were always followed by antinociception. the electrode tips were situated mostly in the central
nucleus of the inferior colliculus as illustrated in fig. 1. because both the lower end of the injection needle and the electrode tip reached 1 mm below the guide cannula of the
chemitrode, brain injections were made close to these electrodes.
gradual increases in the inferior colliculus electrical stimulation of rats tested in the arena caused a state of alertness followed by freezing behavior. the animals stopped their ongoing behavior as if they oriented themselves towards the
stimulus. with further increases in the intensity of the electrical stimulation, freezing behavior gave way to a clear behavioral activation expressed by running and/or jumping.
the data obtained for each aversive threshold determined
by electrical stimulation of the inferior colliculus were submitted to a two-way anova. for the saline group this analysis
revealed that the differences between vigilance (58.12 6
7.19 ma), freezing (73.50 6 10.33 ma), and escape thresholds
(106.25 6 10.24 ma) were highly significant, f(2, 53) 5 14.42,
p , 0.001. this treatment did not significantly affect any aversive thesholds, f(1, 53) 5 1.08, p . 0.05, and no interaction

0.14, p . 0.05. these findings confirm previous studies from
this laboratory showing significant differences in the intensity
of electric current applied to the midbrain tectum in the pro-

histology
upon completion of the experiments, the animals were
deeply anaesthetized with sodium pentobarbital and perfused
intracardially with saline followed by formalin solution
(10%). the brains were removed and 3 days later were frozen. serial 50 mm brain sections were cut using a microtome
and stained with neutral red to localize the positions of the
electrode tips according to the paxinos and watson atlas (41).
data from rats with electrode tips located outside the inferior
colliculus were not included in the statistical analysis.

analysis revealed that these effects were due to changes on
freezing and escape thresholds ( p , 0.05). there was no significant interaction between treatment and thresholds, f(2,
33) 5 1.38, p . 0.05. a factor analysis with repeated measures
considering treatment as the second factor for each aversive
threshold produced qualitatively similar results. also, in this
case the only significant interaction was saline 3 midazolam at
freezing, f(1, 16) 5 7.48, p , 0.05, and escape, f(1, 18) 5 9.78,
p , 0.01, thresholds. these effects are illustrated in fig. 2.
analgesia was invariably detected following aversive reactions induced by electrical stimulation of the inferior colliculus. treatment with saline did not significantly affect this analgesia, f(1, 53) 5 0.19, p . 0.05. pretreatment with local
microinjections of naltrexone in the inferior colliculus, 15 min
before the electrical stimulation procedure, caused no significant effect on the analgesia measured at the aversive thresholds, f(1, 54) 5 0.10, p . 0.05. the lack of effect of this opioid
antagonist could not be attributed to the dose used (13 nmol),
because this dose has been shown to be effective in other experimental situations (17). in contrast, pretreatment with local microinjections with  xxxd2621xxx  in the inferior colliculus
caused a significant inhibition, f(1, 59) 5 11.56, p , 0.05, of
the analgesia elicited by electrical stimulation. post hoc comparisons showed that these effects were due to the effects of
the drug on the analgesia produced by stimulation at the
freezing and escape thresholds (p , 0.05). significant effects
were also obtained with central microinjections of  xxxd2419xxx 
in the midbrain tectum, with the dose of 15 nmol, f(1, 55) 5
6.58, p , 0.05. post hoc analysis also revealed that these effects occurred at the same levels of aversive stimulations (p ,
0.05, at freezing and escape thresholds). there was no interaction between treatments and aversive thresholds when the
pretreatment was naltrexone, f(2, 54) 5 0.55, p . 0.05,  xxxd2621xxx , f(2, 59) 5 1.75, p . 0.05, or  xxxd2419xxx , f(2, 55) 5
0.92, p. 0.05. no significant effect could be seen in the tailflick test, f(1, 33) 5 0.67, p . 0.05, following microinjections
of midazolam into the inferior colliculus. a factor analysis
with repeated measures considering treatment (saline 3 drug)
as the second factor for each aversive threshold produced
qualitatively similar results. the serotonergic blockers were
the only drugs that interacted significantly with saline, f(1,

the present results show that gradual increases in the electrical stimulation of the inferior colliculus of rats induce, progressively, characteristic aversive responses such as arousal,
freezing, and escape behavior. this pattern of responses conform with defense reactions usually seen in rats confronted
with predators (3,13). electrical stimulation of the inferior
colliculus shares many of the aversive properties of the stimulation of structures belonging to the aversive brain system such
as dpag, deep layers of superior colliculus, medial hypothalamus, and amygdala (4,18,21,39). it is possible that the inferior colliculus is also involved in the neural circuit responsible
for aversive reactions. indeed, reciprocal anatomical connections have been demonstrated between the inferior colliculus
and superior colliculus and dpag (10,20,24,29,38), which is
consistent with the demonstration of functional connections
between the inferior colliculus and these structures (27).
of all drugs tested in this study, microinjections of midazolam into the inferior colliculus was the only treatment that
increased the aversive thresholds determined by the brain
electrical stimulation procedure. these findings support the
notion that gaba–benzodiazepine mechanisms exert an inhibitory control on the neural substrates of aversion in the
midbrain tectum (4,8). the lack of effects observed with microinjections of opioid and serotonergic antagonists in the inferior colliculus on the aversive responses also supports previous suggestions that these neurochemical mechanisms exert a
phasic regulation on the neural substrates of aversion in the
midbrain tectum. indeed, opioid and 5-ht receptors agonists
cause clear antiaversive effects when microinjected into the
inferior colliculus (7–9,30,31).
electrical stimulation of the inferior colliculus at each
aversive threshold produced analgesia. there was no effect of
previous experience with aversive thresholds on the nociceptive test, as no interaction occurred between thresholds and
conditions. antinociception usually follows the defensive reactions elicited by stimulation of the neural substrates of fear
in the dorsal mesencephalic structures. stimulation of some
midbrain sites has frequently been reported to be aversive in
animals [for a review, see (8,19)] and humans (35), as well as
to be strongly antinociceptive (41,43). however, analgesia and
the behavioral manifestations of the defense reaction may
have different neurochemical substrates. the opioid receptor
antagonist, naltrexone, reduces fear-induced analgesia, but
does not reduce the occurrence of freezing responses when injected into ventral pag (13). on the other hand, it has been
reported that the analgesia that follows unconditioned responses to aversive stimulation of the dorsal periaqueductal
gray is of nonopioid nature (11,12). in accordance with these
latter findings, our results show that naltrexone was unable to
cause significant changes in the analgesia that followed the
aversive responses induced by electrical stimulation of the inferior colliculus.
in the same way, serotoninergic mechanisms may be independently triggered during the aversive states and the analgesia
induced by stimulation of the inferior colliculus. the present
results show that  xxxd2621xxx , a nonspecific serotoninergic
antagonist, applied directly to the inferior colliculus, blocks
the antinociception induced by electrical stimulation of this

430

structure. these data are in agreement with studies showing
an involvement of serotonergic mechanisms in the dpag
stimulation-produced analgesia (11,12,36). in support of this,
an immunohistochemical study has described appreciable
amounts of serotonergic fibers in the inferior colliculus (45).
in support of these findings, our results indicated an involvement of 5-ht2/ xxxg1115xxx  receptor subtypes in fear-induced analgesia elicited by electrical stimulation of the inferior colliculus. the specific  xxxg1113xxx  antagonist,  xxxd2419xxx , applied
directly into this region blocked the antinociception elicited
by its aversive stimulation. this contrasts with the lack of effects of the 5-ht antagonists on the aversive thresholds. in
fact, in view of previous evidence (30,31), we might even expect an enhancement of the aversive reactions by the 5-ht
antagonists used in this study. thus, an opposite role may be
played by 5-ht mechanisms in the behavioral reaction and
antinociception induced by aversive states, and these components of the defense reaction can be independently integrated
at the level of the inferior colliculus. many studies have reported that serotonin has clear antiaversive effects and a facilitatory action on the analgesia induced by stress, acting through
the activation of 5-ht2/1c receptors in the dpag (19,36,37).
the independence between antinociception and behavioral defense mechanisms have been postulated by several authors (11,12,25,26,33,44). this dissociation at the level of the
dorsal periaqueductal gray matter is mainly supported by experiments showing that benzodiazepines inhibit the defensive
reactions without affecting the antinociception induced by
aversive stimulation of this region (25,26,33). in this study, we
have demonstrated that the aversive effects of inferior colliculus stimulation was clearly inhibited by midazolam, whereas
the antinociception elicited by this stimulation was not. as illustrated in the diagram depicted in fig. 4, these findings provide additional support for the independence of the neural
substrates of analgesia and fear-related behaviors integrated
at the level of the inferior colliculus.

the data obtained here suggest that serotonergic mechanisms are involved in the modulation of the stress-related analgesia induced by brain stem electrical stimulation. an involvement of opioid mechanisms of the inferior colliculus in
the modulation of this response could not be detected with
the technique used in the present study. the possibility of
such modulation cannot be discarded, as microinjections of
opioid antagonists into the inferior colliculus may not influence opioid release in other brain regions due to electrical
stimulation of fibers of passage or output neurons.
evidence obtained in this laboratory show a combined opioid and serotonergic modulation of the behavioral responses
to aversive stimulation of the inferior colliculus (9). similar
findings have also been observed at the level of the dorsal periaqueductal gray; that is, the behavioral responses to aversive
stimulation of this region are under control of opioid (34) and
serotonergic mechanisms (37), whereas the antinociception
produced by this stimulation is mediated only by 5-ht2 receptors (11,12). thus, it is not unlikely that opioid and serotonergic processes may regulate different facets of the defense reaction induced by brain stem electrical stimulation. whereas
the behavioral aversive reaction seems to be a multimediated
process, the analgesia related to fear induced by midbrain tectum electrical stimulation is specifically mediated by serotonergic mechanisms. the pharmacological dissociation of the
behavior and antinociception elicited by inferior colliculus
electrical stimulation is further substantiated by the differential effects of midazolam on both processes.
