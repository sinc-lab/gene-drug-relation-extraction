abstract: oxytocin (ot) and vasopressin (avp) mediate their biological actions by acting on four known
receptors: the ot (uterine) and the avp v1a (vasopressor), v1b (pituitary), v2 (renal) receptors and a ﬁfth
putative avp v1c? (vasodilating) receptor. this presentation will summarize some highlights of the recent
progress, in the design and synthesis of selective peptide agonists, antagonists, radioiodinated ligands,
ﬂuorescent ligands and bivalent ligands for these receptors. here we present published and unpublished
pharmacological data on the most widely used agonists, antagonists and labelled ligands. the
pharmacological properties of promising new selective ot antagonists and v1b agonists are also presented.
this review should serve as a useful guide for the selection of the most appropriate ligand for a given study.
the current status of non-peptide ot and avp antagonists and agonists is also summarized. the relative
merits of peptide and non-peptide avp and ot agonists and antagonists as: (1) research tools and
(2) therapeutic agents will be evaluated. many of the receptor selective peptide agonists and antagonists
from this and other laboratories are far more widely used as pharmacological tools for studies on the
peripheral and central effects of ot and avp than their non-peptide counterparts. in addition to ot and
to a lesser extent avp ( xxxd3495xxx ), a number of ot and avp analogues; such as  xxxd434xxx  (ot agonist)
 xxxd1847xxx  (desmopressin, v2 agonist),  xxxd3318xxx  (v1a agonist),  xxxd2093xxx  (v1a agonist) and atosiban
(tractocile ot antagonist) are also in clinical use. despite much early promise, no non-peptide v1a or ot
antagonists are currently in clinical trials. while a number of orally active non-peptide v2 antagonists
(vaptans); notably,  xxxd3399xxx , lixivaptan and satavaptan, are currently in phase iii clinical trials; to
date, only the mixed v2/v1a, antagonist  xxxd1747xxx  ( xxxd1747xxx ), has been approved by the us fda for
clinical use (by i.v. administration), for the treatment of euvolemic and hypervolemic hyponatremia

introduction
the past 12 years, have witnessed an extraordinary
resurgence of interest in all aspects of neurohypophysial peptide research, including the emergence
of a wide variety of more selective agonists and
antagonists (both peptide and non-peptide) of the
vasopressin (avp) and oxytocin (ot) receptors.
in addition to the numerous publications which
have appeared in peer-reviewed journals in the
past 12 years, 6 world congresses on the
neurohypophysial hormones (wcnh) were
held in: (1) nasu, japan in 1995 (saito et al.,
1995b), (2) montreal, quebec in 1997 (zingg et al.,
1998), (3) edinburgh, scotland in 1999 (douglas
et al., 2000), (4) bordeaux, france in 2001 (poulain
et al., 2002), (5) kyoto, japan in 2003 (kawata
and leng, 2004) and (6) steamboat springs,
colorado in 2005. proceedings from the 2005
wcnh were published in different issues of the
journal of the american physiological society.
the 7th wcnh was held in regensburg,
germany in september 2007: (landgraf and
neumann, 2008). numerous studies exploring the
central and peripheral effects of ot and avp,
using peptides from these laboratories were
reported at all seven wcnh’s. in addition, during
this period, numerous studies, reported in peer
reviewed journals have utilized ot and avp
peptide agonists and antagonists, obtained either
from the manning laboratory or from commercial
sources (see pena et al., 2007a for some examples).
ot and avp receptors belong to a g-protein
coupled receptor family characterized by seven
putative transmembrane helices. for recent reviews
on avp and ot receptors see jard, 1998; barberis
et al., 1999; gimpl and fahrenholz, 2001; holmes
et al., 2003, 2004. ot receptors (otrs) are
expressed in the uterus, the mammary gland, the
ovary, the brain, the kidney, the heart, bone
and in endothelial cells (gimpl and fahrenholz,

2001). in the uterus, otrs mediate the uterine
contracting (oxytocic) effect of ot (gimpl and
fahrenholz, 2001). the central effects of ot
continue to be the focus of intense investigative
scrutiny in animals (insel and young, 2001;
bosch et al., 2005; huber et al., 2005;
ma et al., 2005; parker et al., 2005; ring et al.,
2006) and in humans (hollander et al., 2003, 2007;
kirsch et al., 2005), as a possible therapeutic agent
for the treatment of autism and other anxiety
disorders.
avp mediates its actions through three known
receptors: v1a, v1b and v2 and a putative vasodilating v1c? receptor. v1a receptors are expressed in
the liver, vascular smooth muscle cells, brain and in
many other tissues (jard, 1998; barberis et al., 1999;
holmes et al., 2003, 2004; treschan and peters,
2006). in the vasculature, v1a receptors mediate the
pressor actions of avp by a phospholipase c
mediated pathway. in brain, v1a receptors mediate
the anxiety (ma et al., 2005; ring, 2005) and
aggression (ferris et al., 2006) producing responses
to avp. v1b receptors, present in the anterior
pituitary, mediate the acth releasing effects of
avp, also by a phospholipase c mediating pathway (jard, 1998). in a number of publications
(robert et al., 2005), the  xxxg230xxx  is also
referred to as the v3 receptor. according to the
iuphar nomenclature, v3 is no longer acceptable. evidence for the presence of v1b receptors in
extra-pituitary tissues such as brain, the kidney and
the adrenal medulla has also been reported (saito
et al., 1995a, b). recently the  xxxg230xxx  has been
shown to mediate anxiety and stress in rats and
in humans (landgraf, 2006). v2 receptors, present
in the collecting duct of the kidney, mediate
the antidiuretic action of avp by an adenylate
cyclase mediated pathway (jard, 1998; barberis
et al., 1999; holmes et al., 2003, 2004). the pain
response to avp in the rat appears to be modulated
by v2 receptors (yang et al., 2006). besides its

475

antidiuretic and vasoconstrictor properties,
avp can also cause vasodilation (liard, 1989;
hirsch et al., 1989; walker et al., 1989; tagawa
et al., 1995; van lieburg et al., 1995). the receptor
subtype that mediates the vasodilating actions of
avp has to date not been characterized. studies
aimed at doing so have been hampered by the lack
of speciﬁc vasodilating avp agonists or antagonists. we recently reported the serendipitous
discovery of highly selective avp hypotensive
peptides (chan et al., 1998; manning et al., 1999,
2007; stoev et al., 2006).
besides their value as pharmacological tools and
radioligands, ot and avp antagonists are of
potential clinical value. antagonists of ot are
of potential therapeutic value for the prevention of
premature labour (tsatsaris et al., 2004; manning
et al., 2005; reinheimer et al., 2005; stymiest et al.,
2005; akerlund, 2006; flouret et al., 2006; tan
et al., 2006). atosiban (d[d-tyr(et)2,thr4,orn8]
vasotocin), a peptide ot antagonist (melin et al.,
1986; romero et al., 2000; valenzuela et al., 2000)
is the only tocolytic, approved (in europe)
under the tradename tractocile in, 2001, for the
prevention of premature birth (akerlund, 2006).
non-peptide avp v2 antagonists have potential
therapeutic value for the treatment of the hyponatremia caused by the syndrome of inappropriate
secretion of the  xxxd3495xxx  (siadh)
(serradeil-le gal et al., 2002b; hays, 2006; palm
et al., 2006; schrier et al., 2006; streefkerk and van
zwieten, 2006; verbalis, 2006; cawley, 2007; chen
et al., 2007; gines, 2007; munger, 2007; parashar
et al., 2007). the non-selective non-peptide avp
v2/v1a antagonist,  xxxd1747xxx  (ym-087) (tahara
et al., 1997, 1998) under the tradename ‘‘ xxxd1747xxx ’’
was approved for the treatment, by i.v. only, of
euvolemic hyponatremia by the fda in 2005
(ghali et al., 2006; verbalis, 2006). earlier this
year, it received fda approval for the treatment of
hypervolemic hyponatremia. non-peptide v2 and
v2/v1a antagonists may also have value for the
treatment of heart failure (abraham et al., 2006;
schwarz and sanghi, 2006). they also have
potential as pharmacochaperones for the treatment
of x-linked  xxxg231xxx  (ndi)
(bernier et al., 2006; robben et al., 2007). three

selective non-peptide v2 antagonists are currently
in clinical trial (verbalis, 2006):  xxxd3399xxx  (opc
41061) (yamamura et al., 1998), satavaptan (sr
121 463) (serradeil-le gal et al., 1996) and
lixivaptan (vpa-985) (albright et al., 1998;
schrier et al., 2006; soupart et al., 2006). however
none has yet been approved by the fda.
antagonists of the vascular responses ( xxxg229xxx ) to avp may have clinical potential for the
treatment of those patients with hypertension or
congestive heart failure (chf) with concomitant
elevated plasma avp levels (thibonnier et al.,
2001). they may also be of value as ‘‘serenics’’ in
the management of anger (ferris et al., 2006).
however, with the exception of the v1a antagonist
srx-251 (ferris et al., 2006; guillon et al., 2007a,
b), none are currently in clinical trial. non-peptide
avp v1b antagonists could be of value as
diagnostic agents and as therapeutic agents for the
treatment of acth secreting tumours (serradeille gal et al., 2002a, b, 2007) and for treating
anxiety and stress (griebel et al., 2002; craighead
and macsweeney, 2008).

scope of the this presentation
this review will focus on documenting the pharmacological properties of the most widely used ot
and avp peptide agonists and antagonists, while
also providing data on more promising newer
peptides. space limitations preclude the inclusion
of more than the sketchiest details on how these
peptides were designed. the original publications
and reviews such as (manning et al., 1981; hruby
and smith, 1987; lebl, 1988; manning and sawyer,
1989, 1993) should be consulted for more complete
descriptions. other laboratories, most notably, the
lammek, cordopatis, fluoret, lubell, reinheimer,
slaninova and stymiest laboratories continue to
make important contributions to this ﬁeld. unfortunately, space consideration also preclude the
inclusion of their work here. for examples of their
recent studies see: prochazka and slaninova (1995),
belec et al. (2005), stymiest et al. (2005), flouret
et al. (2006), fragiadaki et al. (2007), kowalczyk
et al. (2007) and reinheimer (2007).

where possible, we will address the issues of
species differences (howl et al., 1991; ruffolo et al.,
1991; pettibone et al., 1992; tahara et al., 1999;
andres et al., 2004; guillon et al., 2004, 2006; chini
and manning, 2007; thibonnier et al., 1997) and
the lack of single receptor speciﬁcity (manning and
sawyer, 1989, 1993; chan et al., 2000) of many of
these peptides. as noted above, peptide agonists
and antagonists have continued to be widely used
as pharmacological tools in a wide variety of
studies. however, quite a number of studies have
utilized some of the earlier non-selective antagonists, clearly unaware that more selective antagonists are available. this applies particularly to ot
antagonists. thus for example, d(ch2)5[tyr
(me)2]ovt, which is in fact ﬁve times more
potent as an avp v1a antagonist than as an ot
antagonist (in vivo) in the rat (bankowski et al.,
1980), continues to be used as a selective ot
antagonist. table 15 provides a list of otas which
are much more selective than d(ch2)5[tyr
(me)2]ovt. we have selected for inclusion in the
different tables primarily those peptides which
have been used as pharmacological tools in the past
and only the most promising of the newer agonists
and antagonists which might be useful in the
future. thus tables 1–3, 5, 6, 8–11, 13–15 provide
pharmacological properties in rat bioassays, of a
wide variety of avp and ot agonists and
antagonists together with radiolabelled and ﬂuorescent derivatives. however, we do not have rat
antioxytocic data for a number of the avp
antagonists in these tables. we also present
preliminary receptor data on bivalent ot and avp
antagonists. in some instances (tables 4–7, 14–16,
20), we provide human and/or rat receptor binding
and functional assay data. all tables contain a
wide variety of old and new avp v1a, v1b, v2 and
 xxxg1642xxx  ligands for use as potential pharmacological tools in a wide variety of studies. the
selective v1b agonists in tables 4–7 are excellent
new tools for probing the human and rat v1b
receptors.
in this review we will also attempt to provide a
status report on the pre-clinical and clinical
development of non-peptide avp and ot antagonists and on the pre-clinical development of
non-peptide avp and ot agonists. the excellent

reviews on non-peptide avp antagonists
(serradeil-le gal et al., 2002b) and on non-peptide
ot antagonists (freidinger and pettibone, 1997)
should be consulted for more in-depth presentations of their chemistry and pharmacology.
as noted earlier, after a very slow start, the clinical
potential of non-peptide v2 antagonists is ﬁnally
beginning to look more promising (hays, 2006;
verbalis, 2006). we will also review the merits of
peptide versus non-peptide avp and ot agonists
and antagonists as (1) research tools and (2) therapeutic agents.

peptide synthesis
all the ot and avp agonists, antagonists,
radiolabelled and ﬂuorescent ligands from our
laboratories were synthesized using the merriﬁeld
solid-phase method (merriﬁeld, 1963; stewart and
young, 1984). the procedures used are described
in the original publications cited here. for other
references see manning (2008).

bioassays
peptides from our laboratories were assayed for
agonistic and antagonistic activities in in vitro and
in vivo rat oxytocic assays in the rat vasopressor
assay and in the rat antidiuretic assay. for
agonists, the four-point assay design (holton,
1948) was used and for antagonists, schild’s pa2
method (schild, 1947) was employed. the pa2 is
the negative logarithm of the molar concentration
of the antagonist that will reduce the response
to 2x units of the agonist to equal the response to
1x unit of the agonist in the absence of antagonist.
in practice, this concentration is estimated by
ﬁnding concentrations above and below the pa2
dose and interpolating on a logarithmic scale. in
the rat in vivo assays, the pa2 dose (effective dose,
ed) is divided by an arbitrarily assumed volume
of distribution of 67 ml/kg (dyckes et al., 1974) in
an attempt to derive the approximate molar
concentration [m] of the pa2 dose in the vicinity
of the receptors. thus, in vivo pa2 values are very
rough estimates. the usp posterior pituitary

477

reference standard or synthetic ot and arginine–
avp, which had been standardized in oxytocic and
vasopressor units against this standard, were used
as agonists for working standards in all bioassays.
in vitro oxytocic assays were performed on
isolated uteri from diethylstilbestrol-primed rats
in a mg2+-free van dyke hasting’s solution
(munsick, 1960). in vivo anti-ot potencies were
determined in urethane-anesthetized diethylstilbestrol-primed rats as previously described (chan and
kelly, 1967). vasopressor assays were performed
on urethane-anesthetized and phenoxybenzaminetreated rats as described by dekanski (1952). the
vasodepressor activity of the hypotensive peptides
was determined in urethane-anesthetized male
rats as previously described (chan et al., 2001;
manning et al., 2007). antidiuretic assays were
on water-loaded rats under ethanol anaesthesia as
described by sawyer (sawyer, 1961).

receptors and  xxxd1773xxx  accumulation (salomon
et al., 1974) for v2 receptors, as previously
described (butlen et al., 1978; cantau et al., 1980;
andres et al., 2002; derick et al., 2002; cheng
et al., 2004; guillon et al., 2006; pena et al.,
2007a, b).

exhibit greater potency and/or selectivity than ot
in the oxytocic, antidiuretic and/or vasopressor rat
bioassays. thus [thr4, gly7]ot and ho[thr4,
gly7]ot which exhibit negligible vasopressor and
antidiuretic activities are highly selective agonists
for the rat uterine receptor. however, as an
example of profound species differences, [thr4,
gly7]ot is not highly selective for the human ot
receptor (barberis et al., 1999; guillon et al., 2004;
chini and manning, 2007).  xxxg1062xxx  [thr4]ot exhibits

an eightfold increase in oxytocic activity relative to
ot in the rat and is thus one of the most potent
ot agonists reported to date. in the human
receptor binding assay, ho[thr4]ot exhibits high
afﬁnity and selectivity for the human otr
(hotr) (ki ¼ 0.31 nm) with respect to the hv1ar
(ki ¼ 17 nm) (dr. claude barberis, personal communication). thus ho[thr4]ot could serve as a
very useful lead for the design and development of
ot analogues having protracted activity relative

479

to ot, for the possible treatment of autism
(hollander et al., 2003, 2007) and for the prevention of postpartum haemorrhage (su et al., 2007).
table 2 lists a number of avp analogues which
exhibit enhanced potency and selectivity in the rat
antidiuretic assay with respect to their vasopressor
and oxytocic activities. in rat bioassays and in
human receptor binding assays dvdavp
(manning et al., 1973; barberis et al., 1999) is a
more potent and selective antidiuretic agonist than
the widely used  xxxd1847xxx  (zaoral et al., 1967). as
shown in table 4,  xxxd1847xxx  has a higher afﬁnity for
the human  xxxg230xxx  than for the human v2
receptor.  xxxd1847xxx  had previously been reported to
be a v1b agonist in humans (saito et al., 1997). in
fact, as another example of species differences,
while  xxxd1847xxx  is selective for the rat  xxxg231xxx 
with respect to the rat v1a and v1b receptors, it is
not selective for the human  xxxg231xxx  with
respect to the v1a and v1b receptors (barberis et
al., 1999; guillon et al., 2004; chini and manning,
2007). the search for a v2 agonist which is
selective for the human  xxxg231xxx  with respect
to the v1a, v1b and ot receptors is still a
challenging goal in this ﬁeld. table 3 lists avp
analogues which exhibit selective vasopressor
agonism with respect to antidiuretic and oxytocic
activities in rat bioassays. peptide 7, table 3,
[phe2]ovt (huguenin, 1964) has been widely used
as a selective  xxxg229xxx  agonist (sawyer and
manning, 1988). however, binding assays indicate
that this peptide is not selective for the rat v1a
receptor (guillon, personal communication).
f-180, synthesized at ferring (aurell et al., 1991)
is even more selective than [phe2]ovt in rat
bioassays (table 3). however, to date it has not
been widely used as a selective v1a agonist. in
human receptor assays (andres et al., 2002), f-180
has been shown to be a highly selective v1a
agonist. however, by contrast with its in vivo
 xxxg229xxx  selectivity in the rat, in rat receptor
binding and functional assays, f-180 is not a
selective v1a agonist (andres et al., 2002). f-180 is
clearly a powerful new tool for the study of v1a
receptors in humans. as a highly selective vasoconstrictor, it is a potential new treatment
for bleeding oesophageal varices in humans
(bernadich et al., 1998).

 xxxg230xxx  agonist development
selective agonists for human and rat v1b receptors
following the historic original synthesis of ot and
avp in the du vigneaud laboratory (du vigneaud
et al., 1954a, b), selective agonists for the avp v1a
and v2 receptors were uncovered relatively easily
in the mid to late sixties, by classical structure
activity studies (for reviews see berde and
boissonnas, 1968; hruby and smith, 1987; jost
et al., 1988; manning and sawyer, 1989, 1993)
(tables 4–7). for a variety of reasons, the search
for selective agonists for the rat and human v1b
receptors proved to be much more challenging and
elusive. the lack of a routine bioassay for the
acth releasing effects of avp was one of the
main reasons for the delay in uncovering selective
v1b agonists. d[d-3-pal2]avp was reported to be a
selective v1b agonist for the sheep  xxxg230xxx 
(schwartz et al., 1991). it is commercially available
and has been utilized in a number of studies as a
selective probe of v1b receptors. however, it was
subsequently shown not to exhibit selective v1b
agonism for the human  xxxg230xxx  (barberis
et al., 1999) (table 4) or for the rat  xxxg230xxx 
(derick et al., 2002) (table 5). the discovery of the
 xxxg230xxx  (antoni, 1984; jard, 1986) and the
subsequent cloning of the  xxxg230xxx  (de keyzer
et al., 1994; sugimoto et al., 1994; saito et al.,
1995a), together with the development of v1b
receptor binding and functional assays, greatly
facilitated the recent discovery of avp agonists
which are selective for (a) the human  xxxg230xxx 
(derick et al., 2002; cheng et al., 2004; guillon
et al., 2006) (tables 4 and 5), (b) the rat v1b
receptor (pena et al., 2007a, b) (table 6) and
(c) which exhibit selectivity for both the human
and the rat v1b receptors (table 7) (guillon et al.,
2007b).
modification of  xxxd160xxx  at position 4 led to first
selective human  xxxg230xxx  agonists
table 4 provides the human v1b, v1a, v2 and ot
receptor afﬁnities for ﬁve position 4 analogues of
1-deamino- xxxd3495xxx  ( xxxd160xxx ) (huguenin
and boissonnas, 1966) together with those of other

480

widely used avp agonists. d[cha4]avp, is the ﬁrst
speciﬁc agonist for the human  xxxg230xxx  (derick
et al., 2002). further modiﬁcations of position 4 in
 xxxd160xxx  uncovered four new peptides which are
even more selective for the human  xxxg230xxx

than d[cha4]avp. these are analogues of  xxxd160xxx 
which have the gln4 residue replaced by leu, orn,
lys and  xxxd1576xxx  (har) (cheng et al., 2004).
d[cha4]avp, has been used as a highly valuable
pharmacological tool in a variety of important
studies (andres et al., 2004; derick et al., 2004;
huber et al., 2005; griffante et al., 2005; reymondmarron et al., 2005, 2006; volpi et al., 2006;

as yet another example of species differences,
d[cha4]avp while fully selective for the human
 xxxg230xxx , with respect to the hv1a, hv2 and hot
receptors is not selective for the rat  xxxg230xxx 
with respect to the rat  xxxg231xxx  (tables 5 and 6).

profound species differences: selective human v1b
agonists exhibit potent antidiuretic activities in rat
bioassays
as noted above, modiﬁcations of  xxxd160xxx  at position
4, led to the breakthrough discovery of agonists
which are selective for the human  xxxg230xxx 
(table 4). in a follow-up study, we examined the
pharmacological properties of these four peptides:
d[x4]avp (where x ¼ leu, orn, lys and har),

(guillon et al., 2006) (table 5). the afﬁnities of
these position-4 analogues for the rat and human
v1b, v1a and ot receptors are almost identical.
these peptides exhibit high afﬁnities for the rat and
human v1b receptors and low afﬁnities for the rat
and human v1a and ot receptors. however their
afﬁnities for the rat and human v2 receptors are
strikingly different. whereas these peptides have
low afﬁnities for the human  xxxg231xxx , by
contrast, they exhibit high afﬁnities for the rat v2
receptor. they also exhibit potent antidiuretic
agonism in rat bioassays (table 5) (guillon et al.,
2006). these ﬁndings present further evidence for
profound species differences between the human
and rat v2 receptors. the ﬁndings in tables 4 and 5
raise important questions regarding the unwanted
v1b agonism of therapeutically used antidiuretic
agonists, such as  xxxd1847xxx  (saito et al., 1997). these
ﬁndings also point to the need for caution when
describing peptides with high antidiuretic activities
and low vasopressor activities as ‘‘selective’’ v2
agonists. since all of the potent antidiuretic
agonists in table 5 are potent v1b agonists also,
they should not be referred to as ‘‘selective’’ v2
agonists with respect to all vp receptors. thus the
design of highly potent v2 agonists which are
devoid of  xxxg230xxx  agonism in the rat and in
humans remains a challenging goal. as noted
below, these ﬁndings also provided very important
leads to the design of the ﬁrst selective v1b agonists
in the rat (pena et al., 2007a, b).
first selective agonists for the rat  xxxg230xxx 
although avp was synthesized in 1954 (du
vigneaud et al., 1954b) it was not until 1984 that
its role in the release of acth and thus in stress
was found to be mediated by a receptor other than
the well-known v1a and v2 receptors (antoni,
1984; jard et al., 1986). this receptor was referred
to as the  xxxg230xxx . the cloning of the rat v1b
receptor (saito et al., 1995a, b) greatly facilitated
the design of selective v1b agonists in the rat. we
very recently reported a breakthrough in the 20
year search for selective agonists for the rat v1b
receptor (pena et al., 2007a, b). this breakthrough
was based on leads uncovered in our successful
design of selective agonists for the human v1b

receptor: d[cha4]avp, d[leu4]avp, (tables 4
and 5) (derick et al., 2002; cheng et al., 2004)
noted above. modiﬁcations of these two peptides
at position 8 with lys, diaminobutyric acid (dab)
and diaminopropionic acid (dap) led to four
peptides which exhibit high afﬁnities and selectivities for the rat  xxxg230xxx  (table 6). in
functional tests, they are full v1b agonists. these
selective rat v1b agonists are excellent new
research tools for exploring the role of avp in
mediating the release of acth and for studies
on the role of avp in stress. remarkably, one of
these selective v1b agonists, d[leu4,lys8]vp (pena
et al., 2007b), had been reported over 30 years ago
(dyckes et al., 1973), 11 years before the discovery
of the avp  xxxg230xxx . because it exhibited very
weak activities in the standard vasopressor and
antidiuretic rat bioassays, it merited very little
interest, until it reemerged in our studies as a
potent and selective v1b agonist in the rat (pena
et al., 2007a, b). an editorial accompanying the
pena et al., 2007b publication, lauds d[leu4,
lys8]vp as ‘‘a promising tool for the study of key
aspects of  xxxg230xxx  function’’ (arban, 2007).
besides their value as research tools, these v1b
agonists provide useful leads to the design of
selective antagonists, radioiodinated, ﬂuorescent
and bivalent ligands for the human and rat avp
v1b receptors.
selective agonists for the rat  xxxg230xxx  are also
selective agonists for the human  xxxg230xxx 
the four peptides in table 6 namely, d[cha4,
lys8]vp, d[cha4, dab8]vp, d[leu4, lys8]vp and
d[leu4, dap8]vp which are selective agonists for
the rat  xxxg230xxx  were subsequently found to
be potent and selective agonists for the human
 xxxg230xxx  (guillon et al., 2007b) (table 7). so
all four of these peptides could be used as
 xxxg230xxx  probes in studies in both rats and
human.

avp agonists which appear to lower blood
pressure in the rat, by acting on the heretofore
uncharacterized putative avp vasodilating
receptor. this new class of avp agonists was
discovered serendipitously during the course of
studies on position 3 in one of our potent avp v2/
v1a/ot antagonists d(ch2)5[d-tyr(et)2, val4]
avp (a) (manning et al., 1982). peptide (b),
(d(ch2)5[d-tyr(et)2, arg3, val4]avp, the arg3
analogue of (a), exhibits a profound hypotensive
effect and is devoid of the characteristic vasopressor, antidiuretic and oxytocic agonistic or antagonistic effects of avp agonists and antagonist
(chan et al., 1998). peptide (b) exhibits a
hypotensive ed ¼ 4.66 mg/100 g [ed is the dose
(in mg/100 g i.v.) that produces a vasodepressor
response of 5 cm2 auc in the 5-min period
following injection of the test peptide (auc,
area under the curve)] (chan et al., 2001). peptide
(c), d(ch2)5[d-tyr(et)2, arg3, val4, lys7,
eda9]lvp the lys7, lys8, eda9 analogue of (b)
(eda ¼ ethylenediamine),
was modiﬁed
at
positions 2, 6 and 9. all of the resulting new
peptides exhibit signiﬁcant gains in hypotensive
potency relative to the parent hypotensive
peptide (b). two in particular, the d-tyr(prn)2
(where prn ¼ normal propyl) and the d-tyr (pri)2
(where pri ¼ isopropyl) analogue of c are 26 and
31 times more potent than (b) (stoev et al., 2006).
they have served as promising leads to new
hypotensive peptides (manning et al., 2007). some
of these selective vasodepressor agonists may (1)
be helpful in the search for the aforementioned
putative avp vasodilatory receptor; (2) be useful
as new pharmacological tools in studies on the
cardiovascular role(s) of avp; and (3) lead to the
development of members of a new class of
antihypertensive agents. the hypotensive peptides
(b) and (c) have been utilized respectively in
two elegant studies by yu et al. (2003) and by
tabrizchi and ford (2004). while we have
succeeded in synthesizing a number of radioiodinateable ligands with potent hypotensive
activity, their 125i derivatives exhibit signiﬁcant
non-speciﬁc binding. the challenge remains to
design ligands with higher afﬁnities, in the
hope of diminishing non-speciﬁc binding. such
high afﬁnity, high speciﬁc ligands are needed to

help to localize the putative vasodilating vp
receptor.

potent cyclic and linear avp  xxxg229xxx 
antagonists
table 9 lists a number of highly potent avp v1a
receptor antagonists. all of these are highly
selective with respect to the  xxxg231xxx . however,
it should be noted that the widely used v1a
antagonist d(ch2)5[tyr(me)2]avp (kruszynski
et al., 1980) (no. 1, tables 9 and 10), also referred
to in many publications as manning compound
is also a potent ot antagonist in vitro and
furthermore, it exhibits ot antagonism (in vivo)
(kruszynski et al., 1980; chan et al., 1996)
(table 10). d(ch2)5[tyr(me)2]avp is also a mixed
v1a/ot antagonist for human vp and ot
receptors (barberis et al., 1999). with the exception of peptides 1–3, tables 9 and 10, none of the
v1a antagonists in table 9 have been examined in
in vitro or in vivo rat oxytocic assays. however,
it is quite likely that they will all exhibit ot
antagonism. so caution should be used in interpreting data from studies which seek to discriminate between v1a and ot receptors with any of
these peptides. for such studies, the highly
selective v1a antagonist d(ch2)5 [tyr(me)2,
dab5]avp (no. 3, table 10) (chan et al., 1996),
which is devoid of ot and v2 agonism and
antagonism, although possessing substantially
reduced anti-v1a potency, offers clear advantages
over any of the other v1a antagonists in table 9.
it has been used as a highly selective probe of avp
v1a receptors (miller et al., 2002). a number of the
linear v1a antagonists or closely related analogues
in table 9 (manning et al., 1988, 1990, 1991,
1992a) have served as precurors for radioiodination, biotinylation and ﬂuorescent labelling (see
howl et al., 1993; thibonnier et al., 1993; barberis
et al., 1995; strakova et al., 1997; durroux et al.,
1999). in fact, the radioiodinated derivatives
of peptide 9 (table 9) i.e. 125i[ho]lva, which
exerts a high afﬁnity for both rat and human v1a
receptors (barberis et al., 1995, 1999) has been
cited in hundreds of studies as a selective
radioligand for v1a receptors.

non-selective rat and human v1b/v1a antagonists
to date, there are no selective peptide v1b
antagonists. however, as shown in tables 11 and
12, a number of cyclic and linear v1a antagonists
have been shown to exhibit vp v1b antagonism
for rat and/or human receptors in vitro and
in vivo. a recent study by ma et al. (2005) reported
that the cyclic v1b/v1a antagonist dp[tyr(me)2,
arg–nh92]avp (manning et al., 1992b)
blocked the acth releasing effects of avp in
vivo in the rat. this peptide was also recently
reported (serradeil-le gal et al., 2002b) to be
a human receptor v1b antagonist (ki ¼ 21 nm).
a number of potent linear (rat and human) v1a
antagonists have also been reported to exhibit
somewhat weaker antagonism for the human v1b
receptor. a very recent study utilized the linear
v1b/v1a antagonist, phaa–d-tyr(et)–phe–gln–
asn–lys–pro–arg–nh2 (no. 3, table 12)
(thibonnier et al., 1997) to block the acth
releasing effects of avp in vivo in the rat
(subburaju and aguilera, 2007).

cyclic and linear v2/v1a antagonists for rat vp
receptors
table 13 lists non-selective and selective cyclic and
linear avp v2/v1a antagonists in the rat: peptides
1–5 are cyclic and peptides 6–10 are linear
(manning and sawyer, 1989, 1993). peptides 3–5
are selective for v2 versus v1a receptors. thus
d(ch2)5[d-ile4, ile4]avp, with an ed ratio of 39,
desgly–nh2, d(ch2)5[d-ile2, ile4]avp, with an
ed ratio of 400 and d(ch2)5[d-ile2, ile4, ala–
nh92]avp, with an ed ratio of 83 have all been
utilized in a wide variety of studies, as selective
probes for avp v2 receptors. a few of these
peptides and their analogues have been shown to
exhibit oxytocic antagonism in the rat (manning
et al., 1987). however, we do not have antioxytocic rat data on all of these. thus, while some are
selective v2 antagonists with respect to avp v1a
receptors in the rat, it is highly probable that none
are selective with respect to the rat  xxxg1642xxx . so
these v2 antagonists should not be used to discriminate between v2 and ot receptors in the rat.

v2 antagonist with high afﬁnity for human v2
receptor
the development of peptide avp v2/v1a antagonists for use as aquaretics in humans was
abandoned at smith kline beecham following the
discovery that the lead v2/v1a candidate, desgly,
d(ch2)5[d-tyr(et)2,val4]avp (manning et al.,
1984) (peptide 2, table 13) was an agonist in
humans (ruffolo et al., 1991) (table 14). with
the emergence of non-peptide v2 antagonists
(see below), no further attempts were made to

ﬁnd a peptide v2 antagonist which would be an
effective v2 antagonist in humans. we now report
the discovery of a new potential candidate,
d(ch2)5[d-tyr(et)2,  xxxg1905xxx ]vavp (peptide 2,
table 14). we previously reported that this peptide
is one of a series of a potent v2/v1a antagonists in
the rat (manning et al., 1997). we now report that
this peptide exhibits a very high afﬁnity
(ki ¼ 0.5 nm) for the human  xxxg231xxx . this
peptide could be a promising lead to the design of
peptide v2 antagonists which are effective in
humans.

development of highly selective ot antagonists in
the rat and in humans
since this subject was last reviewed (manning and
sawyer, 1993), we have designed and synthesized
a number of highly selective ot antagonists
(manning et al., 1995a; chan et al., 1996; manning
et al., 2001, 2005). a number of these are slowly
being adopted as substitutes for one or our

original ot antagonists, d(ch2)5[tyr(me)2]ovt
(peptide 2, table 15). in the rat, this ota is
actually 5 times more potent as a v1a antagonist
than as an ot antagonist (bankowski et al., 1980).
thus this ot antagonist is not suitable for
discriminating between ot and v1a receptors in
the rat. unfortunately, it has been widely misused
as a ‘‘selective’’ ot antagonist. the ot antagonist

(manning et al., 1989) has also found widespread
use as a ‘‘selective’’ ot antagonist. however,
as the data in table 15 clearly shows, with an
ed ratio of 6.6 it is clearly not highly selective.
the [125i]ota is widely used as a probe for
ot receptors (see table 17) (elands et al.,
1988). peptide 3, desgly–nh2, d(ch2)5[tyr(me)2,
thr4]ovt, is far more selective for ot receptors than for v1a receptors when compared to
d(ch2)5[tyr(me)2]ovt. in fact, it is about 18
times more potent as an ot antagonist in the
rat than as a v1a antagonist (manning et al., 1989).
it has been used very effectively in a wide variety
of studies by inga neumann and her colleagues (neumann et al., 2003, 2006). desgly–nh2,
d(ch2)5[d-tyr2, thr4]ovt (peptide 5) is one of
the most selective ot antagonists reported to date
(manning et al., 1995a). it is 95 times more potent
as an ot antagonist than as a v1a antagonist in
the rat. this selective ot antagonist has been
utilized in a variety of studies (pedersen and
boccia, 2002; detillion et al., 2004; smith et al.,
2006; hagedorn et al., 2007; mckee et al., 2007).
although somewhat less potent in vivo than all of
the other otas, other than atosiban (peptide 1),
peptide 8, d(ch2)5,[d-thi2,thr4,tyr–nh92]ovt
(manning et al., 2001), because it is such a weak
v1a antagonist, is one of the most selective ot

antagonists reported to date. it is almost 150 times
more potent as an ot antagonist than as a v1a
antagonist. although this ot antagonist has been
supplied to a number of investigators, to date no
reports on the use of this peptide have been
published. peptide 7, desgly–nh2, d(ch2)5[dtrp2, thr4, dap5]ovt is a potent ot antagonist
in vitro (chan et al., 1996). it exhibits undetectable v1a antagonism. thus in vitro, it exhibits inﬁnite selectivity for ot versus v1a receptors. based
on studies reported to date, peptides 3, desgly–
nh2,d(ch2)5[tyr(me)2,thr4]ovt and 5, desgly–
nh2,d(ch2)5[d-tyr2,thr4]ovt offer clear advantages over d(ch2)5[tyr(me)2]ovt (peptide 2) and
atosiban for in vivo studies requiring the discrimination of ot versus v1a receptors in the rat.

ot antagonists with high afﬁnities and selectivities
for the human  xxxg1642xxx 
table 16 contains a number of new ot antagonists
which have strikingly higher afﬁnities for the
human receptor than the peptide ot antagonist,
atosiban (manning et al., 2005). to date, atosiban is the only ot antagonist, peptide or nonpeptide which has been approved (in europe) for
clinical use as a tocolytic or the prevention of

premature labour (romero et al., 2000; valenzuela
et al., 2000; vatish and thornton, 2002; tsatsaris
et al., 2004).
peptides 1–4 (table 16), the four most promising new ot antagonists, exhibit gains in human
 xxxg1642xxx  afﬁnity relative to atosiban of 449,
263, 1091 and 546. these four peptides are also
more selective for the human  xxxg1642xxx  than for
the human v1a (vascular) receptor relative to
atosiban and exhibit selectivity gains of 93, 64,
39 and 56 respectively. these new ot antagonists
clearly possess a superior and safer pharmacological proﬁle as potential tocolytic agents than
atosiban. they are thus promising new candidates
for development as potential tocolytic agents for
the prevention of premature labour. in this regard,
it should be noted that ferring has recently
reported a new peptide ot antagonist, fe200440
(barusiban) (nilsson et al., 2003) which also
exhibits much higher afﬁnities and selectivities for
the hotr than atosiban. barbusiban is currently
being evaluated as a potential tocolytic in nonhuman primates (reinheimer et al., 2005;
reinheimer, 2007).
in table 16, we present human ot and v1a
receptor afﬁnity data (c. barberis; personal
communication) for the widely used ot antagonist
d(ch2)5[tyr(me)2]ovt (bankowski et al., 1980).
with a hotr ki ¼ 3.49 nm, this peptide exhibits a
gain in afﬁnity of 22 relative to atosiban. with a
hv1ar ki ¼ 32.7 nm, its afﬁnity for the hv1ar
is lower than that of atosiban. it thus exhibits a
gain in otr/ xxxg229xxx  selectivity of 134 relative to
atosiban. the rat and human data for d(ch2)5
[tyr(me)2]ovt in tables 15 and 16 are more
examples of striking species differences. thus, in
the rat this peptide is ﬁve times more potent as a
v1a antagonist, than as an ot antagonist: whereas
in humans, its afﬁnity for the  xxxg1642xxx  is over
nine times higher than for the  xxxg229xxx .

radiolabelled ligands for rat and/or human
vasopressin and oxytocin receptors
tritiated and radioiodinated ligands for avp and
ot receptors (table 17) have found widespread
use in receptor localization and identiﬁcation

studies (for references see manning et al., 1995b).
until the discovery of radioiodinated ligands,
these studies relied solely on tritiated ligands.
while tritiated ot is speciﬁc for rat and human
ot receptors, tritiated avp and lvp lack
speciﬁcity for a single receptor subtype. the
tritiation of the selective  xxxg1642xxx  agonist,
[thr4,gly7]ot (elands et al., 1988), the selective
 xxxg231xxx  agonist  xxxd1847xxx  (marchingo et al.,
1988), the selective v1a antagonist, d(ch2)5[tyr
(me)2]avp (howl et al., 1991) and the selective v2
antagonist, desgly–nh2, d(ch2)5[d-ile2, ile4]avp
(trinder et al., 1991) led to labelled ligands which
are highly selective for rat ot, v1a and v2
receptors (table 17). radioiodinated ligands offer
signiﬁcant advantages over tritiated peptides. they
are easier and less expensive to prepare. also, they
possess much higher speciﬁc radioactivities which
can improve the sensitivity and accuracy of
receptor binding studies. furthermore, radioiodination permits much more rapid and deﬁnitive
radioautograhic localization of receptors. table 17
lists a number of radioiodinated ligands for rat
and/or human ot, v1a and v2 receptors which we
and others have developed. two in particular,
[125i]ota (elands et al., 1988) (no. 9) and
[125i]ho–lva (barberis et al., 1995) (no. 14)
have found widespread use as selective probes
respectively of ot and v1a rat and human
receptors. peptide 10 [125i] d(ch2)5[d-tyr(et)2,
val4, tyr–nh92]avp is a high afﬁnity non-selective
radioiodinated ligand for the human  xxxg231xxx 
(ala et al., 1997). peptide 11, [125i] d(ch2)5
[d-ile2,ile4,tyr–nh92]avp (manning et al.,
1995b; barberis et al., 1999) is a high afﬁnity
somewhat selective ligand for the rat  xxxg231xxx .
it has been utilized in studies by cotte et al. (1998)
and tian et al. (2000). preliminary afﬁnity data
for the rat and human v2 receptors for a variety
of peptide and [125i] peptide v2 antagonists are
reported in (manning et al., 1995b). with the
exception of the aforementioned [125i] d(ch2)5
[d-tyr(et)2, val4, tyr–nh92]avp (ala et al., 1997),
all of these peptides reveal striking species
differences between the rat and human v2 receptors. there is thus still a need for a high afﬁnity
selective radioiodinated ligand for the rat and
human v2 and v1b receptors. sanoﬁ has reported

(serradeil-le gal et al., 2000) and the tritiated
non-peptide v1b antagonist sr-149415 (serradeille gal et al., 2007). these tritiated ligands promise
to be useful tools for studies on the rat and human
v2 and v1b receptors. however, high non-speciﬁc
binding, due to the hydrophobicity of the tritiated
sr-149415, will preclude its usefulness for the
detection of low levels of v1b receptors by
autoradiographic techniques.

high afﬁnity ﬂuorescent agonists and antagonists
for human ot and avp receptors
previous studies have shown the value of ﬂuorescent avp analogues for studies on rat and
human avp receptors (buku et al., 1988, 1989;

eggena and buku, 1989; buku and gazis, 1990;
lutz et al., 1990; guillon et al., 1992; howl et al.,
1993; thibonnier et al., 1993). tables 18 and 19 list
some new ﬂuorescent agonists and antagonists for
the human ot and avp receptors. the ﬂuorescent
ot agonists in table 18 exhibit very high afﬁnities
and selectivities for the human  xxxg1642xxx 
(terrillon et al., 2002). these ﬂuorescent ot
agonists are very useful tools for studies on
desensitization and the possible internalization of
the ligand  xxxg1642xxx . these ﬂuorescent ligands
can also be used to perform ﬂuorescence recovery
after photobleaching to study the diffusion of
molecules in a tissue or in one cell and to obtain
structural information for ligand receptor interactions for ﬂuorescence quenching, polarization or
resonance energy transfer experiments (terrillon
et al., 2002). the novel ﬂuorescent linear antagonists in table 19 exhibit high afﬁnities and

491

selectivity for the human avp  xxxg229xxx 
(durroux et al., 1999). these linear ﬂuorescent
 xxxg229xxx  ligands will be useful tools for studies
on the structural basis of ligand recognition by
avp receptors. these two high afﬁnity human v1a
receptor ligands can be used in cellular and
subcellular analysis and co-localization with other
markers in ﬂuorescence microscopy. the ﬂuorescent linear v1a human receptor antagonist no. x1
(table 19) can be readily used for ﬂow cytoﬂowmetric cell analysis and cell sorting. it may thus
offer advantages over iodinatable ligands for
screening new molecules acting on human avp
receptors. one of these ﬂuorescent linear v1a
antagonists (rhm8pva) no. 2 (table 19) has
been utilized to visualize avp v1a receptors in the
rat liver (tran et al., 1999).

bivalent ligands for human and rat ot and v1a
receptors
as part of a study on chimeric peptides, wheatley
and colleagues reported the ﬁrst bivalent ligands of
a linear v2/v1a antagonist for the rat v1a and v2
receptors (howl et al., 1997) (table 20). we
recently reported the syntheses and some preliminary pharmacological properties of bivalent
ligands for the hotr, v1a and v1b receptors
(chini et al., 2007; chini and manning, 2007).
suberic acid, (hooc–(ch2)6–cooh) utilized as
reported by gera et al. (1996), served as the spacer
joining orn or lys residues in an ot/v1a
antagonist d(ch2)5[tyr(me)2]ovt, and two linear
v1a/ot antagonists, ho–phaa–d-tyr(me)–phe–
gln–asn–arg–pro–lys–nh2, and hophaa–dtyr(me)–phe–gln–asn–arg–pro–arg–lys–nh2.
the resulting suberyl-(oc–ch2)6–co–) bivalent
ligands exhibit high afﬁnities, in the nanomolar
range, for the hotr and v1a receptors expressed in
heterologous cell systems. as otr/v1a, otr/v1b
and v1a/v1b heterodimers may be postulated to
exist in the central nervous system as well as in
peripheral organs and tissues (terrillon et al.,
2003), the pharmacological potential of bivalent
ligands now needs to be explored. however, the
lack of experimental evidence for the formation,
in vivo, of dimers or heterodimers and the
difﬁculty of setting-up pharmacological assays for
the screening and identiﬁcation of the properties of
bivalent ligands, represent real challenges in this
ﬁeld. in fact, as in the case of bivalent ligands
targeting opioid receptors (daniels et al., 2005;

non-peptide  xxxg229xxx  antagonists
non-peptide vasopressin and oxytocin antagonists
and agonists
since the discovery of the ﬁrst non-peptide v1a
antagonist by otsuka (yamamura et al., 1991), at
least 10 other pharmaceutical companies have
published non-peptide v1a, v1b, v2, v2/v1a and
ot antagonists. also, more recently, at least three
companies have reported non-peptide agonists for
the  xxxg231xxx  and for the  xxxg1642xxx . to date,
there are no reports on non-peptide v1a or v1b
agonists. the current status of the development
and clinical trials on non-peptide antagonists and
agonists is summarized below and in tables 21–24.
as noted above, the non-peptide ot antagonists
and non-peptide avp antagonists are reviewed
respectively in (freidinger and pettibone, 1997)
and in (serradeil-le gal et al., 2002b). the
original references cited in these two reviews and
those cited here can be consulted for more details
on the structures, syntheses, pharmacological
properties, species differences, lack of receptor
selectivity, pre-clinical studies and when carried

following the report in 1991 by the otsuka
company of the ﬁrst non-peptide v1a antagonist
opc-21268 (yamamura et al., 1991) a number of
other companies, most notably sanoﬁ-synthelabo,
yamanouchi, and fujisawa (the two latter now
combined as astellas) have developed other nonpeptide v1a antagonists (table 21). among the
most promising are sr49059 (relcovaptan), developed by sanoﬁ in 1993 (serradeil-le gal et al.,
1993), ym218, developed by yamanouchi in 2005
(tahara et al., 2005), and srx251, developed in
2006 by azevan (ferris et al., 2006; guillon et al.,
2007a, b). as an example of both species differences and lack of receptor selectivity, the otsuka
v1a antagonist opc-21268 was subsequently
shown to have a poor afﬁnity for the human v1a
receptor (serradeil-le gal et al., 1993) and to also
have afﬁnity for the rat and human ot receptors
(freidinger and pettibone, 1997). thus, although
opc-21268 was ineffective in humans, it served as
an excellent lead to the design, at merck, of
promising non-peptide ot antagonists (freidinger
and pettibone, 1997) and to the design at otsuka of

the ﬁrst non-peptide v2 antagonist opc-31260
(mozavaptan) (yamamura et al., 1992). avp v1a
antagonists have potential as therapeutic agents for
the treatment of raynaud’s disease, hypertension,
chf, brain oedema,  xxxd1892xxx , oncology,
(small cell lung carcinoma), dysmenorrhea, preterm
labour, anger reduction (serenics). the sanoﬁ v1a
antagonist sr49059 (relcovaptan) has a high
afﬁnity for both rat and human v1a receptors.
while it has proved to be very valuable in proof of

concept studies on the role of avp in a number of
the above diseases, its clinical development has
been discontinued (serradeil-le gal et al., 2002b).
given the early promise of non-peptide v1a
antagonists as therapeutic agents, it is somewhat
surprising that to date, with the exception of
srx251 (ferris et al., 2006; guillon et al.,
2007a), there are no clinical trials underway with
any of the many non-peptide v1a antagonists which
have emerged from pre-clinical studies. the

494

development of srx251 for the treatment of
aggression and anger management is potentially
very exciting (ferris et al., 2006).

the report by otsuka in 1992 of the ﬁrst nonpeptide v2 antagonist opc-31260 (mozavaptan)
(yamamura et al., 1992), elicited much interest in
the development of other non-peptide v2 antagonists for the treatment of hyponatremia at six
other pharmaceutical companies. to date, these
studies have uncovered a variety of orally active
non-peptide v2 antagonists shown to be effective
as aquaretics in animals and in humans. as a class,
these have been termed vaptans. (for reviews see:
thibonnier et al., 2001; serradeil le gal, 2002b;
orlandi et al., 2005; palm et al., 2006; streefkerk
and van zwieten, 2006; verbalis, 2006; cawley,
2007; gines, 2007; chen et al., 2007; parashar
et al., 2007; shackel and mccaughan, 2007.) the
following are some of the most promising vaptans
uncovered to date.

3. vpa-985 (lixivaptan), developed by wyethayerst (albright et al., 1998). all three
vaptans are currently in phase iii clinical
trials. although none to date has received us
fda approval. the clinical trials with
 xxxd3399xxx  (schrier et al., 2006; gheorghiade
et al., 2007); satavaptan (soupart et al., 2006)
and lixivaptan (abraham et al., 2006) have
shown promise for the treatment of hyponatremia, liver cirrhosis, chf and polycystic
kidney disease. consequently, the encouraging results reported to date have elicited
many reviews and reports on their efﬁcacy in
a wide variety of journals (see for example:
orlandi et al., 2005; palm et al., 2006;
streefkerk and van zwieten, 2006; verbalis,

non-peptide v2/v1a antagonists
the dual non-peptide v2/v1a antagonist ym-087
( xxxd1747xxx ), developed at yamanouchi (tahara
et al., 1997, 1998) and marketed under the name
 xxxd1747xxx  by astellas pharma is the only vaptan
approved by the us fda for i.v. use in the
treatment of hyponatremia (verbalis, 2006;
walter, 2007) (table 21). this dual non-peptide
v2/v1a antagonist thus holds the distinction of
being the ﬁrst non-peptide avp antagonist
approved for clinical use. it is somewhat ironic,
that in view of all the advantages of its oral
bioavailability, it was approved for i.v. administration and not for oral administration.  xxxd1747xxx  is also used in clinical trial for the treatment of
heart failure (schwarz and sanghi, 2006).
in december 2006 the veterans health administration’s pharmacy beneﬁts management (pbm)
strategic health care group published a national
pbm drug monograph entitled ‘‘ xxxd1747xxx 
hydrochloride injection (vaprisols)’’. this monograph, which can be accessed at www.pbm.va.gov
addresses the beneﬁts and risks involved in the use
of  xxxd1747xxx  to treat euvolemic hyponatremia
and chf by i.v. administration in a hospital
setting. in noting that  xxxd1747xxx  is a potent
cytochrome cyp3a4 inhibitor and substrate,
caution is urged in the administration of this drug
with other drugs which inhibit this enzyme and
points to this concern as the main reason that
 xxxd1747xxx  was approved for i.v. rather than oral
administration. finally, following a thorough
analysis of the clinical data, this monograph does
not recommend that patients with envolemic

495

hyponatremia be treated with  xxxd1747xxx  ‘‘until it
has been found to be superior to time proven safe
and effective therapies such as free water restriction and/or intravenous saline’’. furthermore,
until safety issues are addressed, the monograph
concludes that  xxxd1747xxx  should not become
‘‘standard therapy’ for the treatment of chf. so
clearly, further studies are need to prove the longterm safety and efﬁcacy of  xxxd1747xxx . thus its
approval by oral administration is still very much
in doubt. other non-peptide v2/v1a antagonists, currently in preclinical development, include ym-471
(astellas) (tsukada et al., 2002) and cl-385004
(wyeth ayerst) (aranapakam et al., 1999).

marked antidepressant-like activity in several
predictive animal models (griebel et al., 2002).
more recently, organon has obtained a patent for
a highly promising orally active v1b antagonist,
org-52186 (letourneau et al., 2006). this was
very recently reported to be effective in the
reduction of chronic stress and aggression in the
rat (craighead and macsweeney, 2008). org52186 possesses a high afﬁnity and selectivity for
the human  xxxg230xxx . it also possesses a high
afﬁnity for the rat  xxxg230xxx  and is a v1b
antagonist in both species (personal communication from mark craighead). the non-peptides
ssr-149415 and org-52186 are valuable new
tools for studying animal and human v1b receptors. in this regard, they very much compliment
the selective v1b peptide agonist ligands noted
above — namely d[cha4]avp, selective for the
human  xxxg230xxx  (derick et al., 2002; guillon
et al., 2004) and d[leu4,lys8]vp, selective for the
rat  xxxg230xxx  (pena et al., 2007a, b).

non-peptide v1b antagonists
to date, only two companies, sanoﬁ, and organon
have reported success in this area (table 21). the
ﬁrst non-peptide v1b antagonist ssr-149415 was
reported in 2002 (serradeil-le gal et al., 2002a, b).
ssr-149415 is orally active and was reported to
possess high and selective afﬁnity for rat and
human v1b receptors in vitro and in vivo (serradeille gal et al., 2002a, b, 2005). this non-peptide v1b
antagonist was subsequently shown to also exhibit
human receptor ot antagonism (griffante et al.,
2005). it is currently in pre-clinical development
for the treatment of anxiety and depression. it has
been shown to decrease anxiety in rats and exerts

non-peptide oxytocin antagonists
the emergence of orally active non-peptide ot
antagonists at the merck laboratories in the early
nineties (evans et al., 1992) appeared to ﬁll a
therapeutic void for an effective orally active
tocolytic for the treatment and prevention of
premature labour (table 22). however, due to

suboptimal pharmacokinetics and oral bioavailability, clinical trials with what appeared to be a
promising ot antagonist ( xxxd240xxx ), (pettibone
et al., 1993; williams et al., 1995) were discontinued (freidinger and pettibone, 1997). some of
the merck non-peptide ot antagonists, such as
l-371, 257 exhibit striking species differences for
the v1a receptors in rat and human (freidinger and
pettibone, 1997). in a recent study, the nonpeptide ot antagonist  xxxd240xxx  (pettibone
et al., 1993) was reported to have cns effects
after oral administration (boccia et al., 2007).
another recent study reported that a non-peptide
ot antagonist developed at wyeth-ayerst, way162720 also penetrates the brain (ring et al.,
2006). thus the non-peptide ot antagonists
 xxxd240xxx  and way 162720 are promising new
tools for studies on the cns effects of ot. in
1998, merck reported another promising nonpeptide ot antagonist: l-372, 662 (bell et al.,
1998). however, despite promising pre-clinical
studies with l-372, 662, the development of
tocolytics at merck has not been resumed. merck
non-peptide ot antagonists, such as l-371,257
(williams et al., 1995), have proven to be very
useful pharmacological tools (see for example
wilson et al., 2001; hawtin et al., 2005; liu
et al., 2005; ring et al., 2006).
currently there are no ongoing clinical trials
with non-peptide/ot antagonists. recently however, three other companies: serono, sanoﬁ and
glaxosmithkline have reported the following
promising orally active non-peptide ot antagonists. serono (cirillo et al., 2003; quattropani
et al., 2005), sanoﬁ:  xxxd188xxx  (serradeille gal et al., 2004) and glaxosmithkline:
gsk221149a (mccafferty et al., 2007). the
gsk221149a non-peptide ot antagonist appears
to be a highly promising orally active non-peptide
ot antagonist. this molecule exhibits a high
afﬁnity (ki ¼ 0.65 nm) and selectivity for the
human  xxxg1642xxx . it has also been shown to be
an effective tocolytic by i.v. and by oral administration in rats. from the data presented by
mccafferty et al., 2007, gsk 221149a appears
to have a superior spectrum of afﬁnity and
selectivity for the human  xxxg1642xxx  versus the
hv1ar compared to the non-peptide ot

antagonists reported by merck, serono and sanoﬁ.
in light of the fact, as noted above, that the two
non-peptide ot antagonists  xxxd240xxx  and way162720 are brain penetrants (ring et al., 2006;
boccia et al., 2007), the possibility that non-peptide
ot antagonists might cross the blood brain barrier
and thus block the central effects of ot both in the
foetus and in the mother, will need to be examined
before any of these non-peptide ot antagonists are
approved for clinical use.

non-peptide vasopressin agonists
to date, three companies have been active in
this area otsuka, ferring and wyeth ayerst
(table 23). the only non-peptide avp agonists
reported to date are selective for the avp v2
receptor. to date, no non-peptide agonists have
been reported for the avp v1a or v1b receptors. in
2000, otsuka reported the ﬁrst non-peptide v2
agonist opc-51803 (nakamura et al., 2000;
kondo, 2002). this non-peptide v2 agonist has
been reported to have advantages, in terms of
receptor selectivity and oral bioavailability, over
the widely used  xxxd1847xxx  (desmopressin) (makaryus
and mcfarlane, 2006) for the treatment of patients
with central diabetes insipidus and nocturnal
enuresis (nakamura et al., 2000). this non-peptide
v2 agonist is currently in phase ii clinical development. also in phase ii clinical development, is the
non-peptide v2 agonist fe-106483 being developed
by ferring. there is no information available on the
current status of the trials with both of these nonpeptide v2 agonists: opc-51803 and fe-106483.

wyeth ayerst recently reported a novel class of
non-peptide v2 agonists (failli et al., 2006). given,
that desmopressin has in recent years become
widely used in tablet form for oral administration
(lam et al., 1996; janknegt et al., 1997) and is the
current drug of choice for long-term therapy
of central diabetes insipidus (makaryus and
mcfarlane, 2006), all three non-peptide v2 agonists
face stiff hurdles in displacing the wide acceptance
and effective therapeutic use of  xxxd1847xxx  for the
treatment of diabetes insipidus. also,  xxxd1847xxx , by
slow i.v. administration, has for many years been
shown to be efﬁcacious in treating mild haemophilia a and von willebrands disease (for review see
mannucci and levi, 2007). it remains to be seen
whether non-peptide v2 agonists will be useful
therapies for these indications.

non-peptide oxytocin agonists
this area has seen very little activity over the years
(table 24). however the recent surge in studies
showing that ot may be of therapeutic value for
the treatment of a wide variety of neuropsychiatric
diseases, including, autism, anxiety related disorders and schizophrenia (insel and young, 2001;
hollander et al., 2003, 2007; neumann et al., 2003,

and young, 2006; meinlschmidt and heim, 2007;
ring et al., 2006), has catalyzed two companies to
develop non-peptide agonists for possible therapeutic development. in 2004, ferring reported a
series of non-peptide ot agonists (pitt et al.,
2004). the therapeutic potential of non-peptide

ot agonists has been recently reviewed (ashworth
et al., 2006). very recently, wyeth-ayerst obtained
a u.s. patent for the development of therapeutically useful non-peptide ot agonists (rahman
et al., 2007). studies on a lead compound way267464 were more recently reported (ring, 2007).
obviously, it is far too early to assess the
therapeutic utility of these novel non-peptide ot
agonists from ferring and wyeth ayerst.

research uses of peptide and non-peptide ot and
avp agonists, antagonists, radiolabelled ligands
and ﬂuorescent ligands
peptides as research tools
by virtue of their water solubility, peptides are
clearly superior to non-peptides as research tools.
literally, many hundreds of studies have been
carried out with peptide agonists, antagonists,
radiolabelled and ﬂuorescent ligands for the avp
and ot receptors (see sawyer et al., 1988; sawyer
and manning, 1988; manning and sawyer, 1989,
1993). the following are examples of highly
signiﬁcant studies carried out with avp and ot
peptide agonists and antagonists during the past 5
years (loichot et al., 2002; miller et al., 2002;
pedersen and boccia, 2002; chandrashekhar et al.,

species differences and lack of speciﬁcity
species differences (howl et al., 1991; ruffolo
et al., 1991; pettibone et al., 1992; thibonnier et al.,
1997; tahara et al., 1999; andres et al., 2004;
guillon et al., 2004; chini and manning, 2007;
chini et al., 2008) and lack of speciﬁcity for a given
receptor (manning and sawyer, 1989, 1993; chan
et al., 2000; chini et al., 2008) continue to be a
concern in this ﬁeld. we have attempted to address
these problems in this review, by presenting the
pharmacological properties in rat bioassays and
in rat and human receptor assays for many of the
most widely used ot and avp analogues. both
problems and how to deal with them are addressed
in more detail in the accompanying publication
(chini et al., 2008). investigators who purchase
these reagents from suppliers are strongly advised
to consult the literature to obtain the original
pharmacological data. table 25 lists commercial
suppliers of many of the peptides discussed here.
non-peptides as research tools
poor aqueous solubility has limited the usefulness
of non-peptides as research tools, especially for
studies requiring i.c.v. administration. also, nonpeptide antagonists are not available as pharmacological reagents from commercial sources. so
they must be obtained from the pharmaceutical
companies to which they belong or by resynthesis.
for propriety reasons, companies are reluctant to
provide samples to other investigators while they
are being developed for potential clinical use. so,

for these reasons; poor aqueous solubility and lack
of availability, non-peptide avp and ot agonists
or antagonists have not been used as widely as
research tools as their peptide counterparts. this
applies particularly to agonists. investigators have
a wide variety of peptide v1a, v1b, v2 and ot
agonists to chose from, whereas until, very
recently, non-peptide agonists did not exist. however, as noted above, non-peptide ot antagonists
from merck, non-peptide v1a and v2 antagonists
from otsuka and non-peptide v1a antagonists from
sanoﬁ, which are no longer in development have
been utilized in a number of important studies.
also, otsuka and sanoﬁ have provided their nonpeptide v2 antagonists  xxxd3399xxx  (opc41061) and
satavaptan (sr121463(b)) for use as pharmacological tools in a very recent study which points
to the use of v2 antagonists for the treatment of
 xxxg231xxx  (robben et al.,
2007). sanoﬁ has also provided the non-peptide
v1b antagonist sr 149415 for a very interesting
study which demonstrates the use of this nonpeptide v1b antagonist as a pharmacological
chaperone with the ability to reverse the misfolding
of the human pituitary  xxxg230xxx  (robert et al.,
2005).

therapeutic uses of peptide and non-peptide agonists
and antagonists
peptides as therapeutic agents
ot,  xxxd434xxx , [1-deamino-1-monocarba-2-omethyltyrosine]oxytocin (su et al., 2007), avp
( xxxd3495xxx ),  xxxd1847xxx  (desmopressin) ( xxxd1847xxx )
(makaryus and mcfarlane, 2006),  xxxd3318xxx 
(triglycyl lysine vasopressin (zuberi, 2007)),  xxxd2093xxx 
([2-phenylalanine]lysine
vasopressin)
(cecanho et al., 2006), lypressin (lysine vasopressin) and the ot antagonist, atosiban (akerlund,
2006), have been approved for clinical use in the
us, canada and/or in europe. for a review of the
use of avp and its analogues in clinical medicine,
see treschan and peters (2006). as noted above,
orally active desmopressin has become available
in tablet form (lam et al., 1996; janknegt et al.,

499

1997). as noted below, this breakthrough is highly
relevant to re-energizing the development of
peptide v2/v1a antagonists for therapeutic use as
aquaretics.
non-peptides as therapeutic agents
as noted earlier, to date — only  xxxd1747xxx  has
been approved by the us fda for i.v. use for the
treatment of hyponatremia in a hospital setting
(verbalis, 2006; walter, 2007).  xxxd3399xxx , lixivaptan and satavaptan are currently in clinical
trial as orally active therapeutic agents for the
treatment of hyponatremia, liver cirrhosis and
chf (verbalis, 2006). the safety concerns surrounding the use of these vaptan aquaretics are
addressed in a recent review (verbalis, 2006). in
correspondence following the publication of a
clinical trial with  xxxd3399xxx  (schrier et al., 2006),
all authors express concern that more long-term
efﬁcacy and safety studies will need to be carried
out with  xxxd3399xxx  before it an be recommended
as standard therapy for hyponatremia of all
aetiologies (dawwas, 2007; hoorn and zietse,
2007; ozkan et al., 2007; weise et al., 2007).
clearly further studies are needed to determine
best practice clinical use over time of these long
awaited therapeutic agents.

conclusion
while ot and avp agonists, antagonists, radiolabelled and ﬂuorescent ligands have found widespread use as research tools in a wide variety of
in vitro and in vivo studies on the peripheral
and central effects of these peptides, many
investigators continue to use some earlier peptides
which lack speciﬁcity for a given receptor type.
in this review we have attempted to provide a
snapshot of the current state of the art on the
available ot and avp agonists and antagonists
for the  xxxg1642xxx , for the v1a, v1b and v2
receptors and for the putative avp hypotensive
(v1c?) receptor. data on the most widely used
and some very new ot and avp agonists are
presented in tables 1–8. tables 4–7 contain rat
bioassay data and human receptor data on

recently discovered high afﬁnity, selective v1b
receptor agonists. these promise to be very
valuable new pharmacological tools for studies
on the rat and human v1b receptors. species
differences between the rat and human v2 receptors are clearly evident in the data presented in
tables 4 and 5. the ﬁndings reported here have
profound implications for previously published
avp antidiuretic agonists. in all likelihood, many
will be found to exhibit potent v1b agonism in the
rat and in the human — similar to that observed
for  xxxd1847xxx  (saito et al., 1997) and for the selective
hv1b receptor agonists which we reported (guillon
et al., 2006). the novel hypotensive agonists
reported in table 8 are not yet available commercially. here we point to the shortcomings of many
of our most potent v1a antagonists, such as
d(ch2)5[tyr(me)2]avp (kruszynski et al., 1980).
the v1a antagonists that have been examined in
anti-oxytocic (anti-ot) assays, exhibit ot antagonism. unfortunately, many of the original v1a
antagonists were not examined in anti-ot assays.
however, to be on the safe side, investigators
should assume that they will exhibit some antioxytocic potency in vitro and possibility also in
vivo. the selective v1a/ot antagonists in table 10
are not yet available from commercial sources.
while tables 11 and 12 list some non-selective
v1b/v1a antagonists — none are really ideal. so the
search for selective peptide v1b antagonists must
continue. caution also needs to be exercised in the
use of the selective cyclic and non-selective v2/v1a
antagonists in table 13. these are selective for
the  xxxg231xxx  with respect to the  xxxg229xxx  in
the rat. they are not selective with respect to the
 xxxg1642xxx . since their  xxxg230xxx  properties
have not been examined, some of these may also
not be selective with respect to the  xxxg230xxx .
species differences between the rat and human v2
receptors, proved to be a major stumbling block
to the development of a peptide v2 antagonist
which would be an effective aquaretic in humans
(ruffolo et al., 1991; manning et al., 1995b;
thibonnier et al., 1997). the design of a peptide
v2 antagonist which is an effective aquaretic
in humans remains a challenging goal. peptide
v2/v1a antagonists which are effective in humans
would be very valuable pharmacological tools

500

and analogous to the us fda approved
 xxxd1747xxx , could also be excellent candidates
for development as therapeutic agents by i.v.
administration in a hospital setting. as illustrated
by the pharmacological properties of the peptide
ot antagonists in tables 15 and 16, striking
progress has been made in the development of
selective ot antagonists for the rat and for the
human receptor.
some widely used and more recent radiolabelled
and ﬂuorescent ligands for the ot and avp v1a
and v2 receptors are listed in tables 17–19. the
tritiated non-peptide v1b antagonist, sr-149415
(serradeil-le gal et al., 2007) promises to be a
useful new tool for studies on rat and human v1b
receptors. finally, we report some preliminary
ﬁndings on promising new bivalent antagonist
ligands for the avp hv1a and hot receptors
(chini et al., 2007). while the bivalent ligand
approach has proved to be very valuable for a wide
variety of gpcr ligands (halazy, 1999), with the
exception of a study by howl et al. (1997), until
now, this approach has been unexplored in the
avp/ xxxg1642xxx  ﬁeld. the preliminary ﬁndings
reported in table 20 clearly indicates the merits of
further exploration of this approach for the design
of ot and avp receptor selective agonists and
antagonists.
in this review we have also presented a summary
in tables 21–24 of the current state of pre-clinical
and clinical development of non-peptide avp v1a,
v1b, v2/v1a antagonists, non-peptide ot antagonists and non-peptide ot and avp v2 agonists.
to date, there are no non-peptide v1a or ot
antagonists currently in clinical trial. however, the
recently reported v1a antagonist srx251,
reported by azevan (ferris et al., 2006), offers
promise as a new therapeutic agent for the
treatment of aggression and for anger management. the non-peptide v1b antagonists ssr149415 and org 52186 from sanoﬁ (serradeil
le-gal, 2002a, b, 2007) and organon (letourneau
et al., 2006; craighead and macsweeney, 2008)
respectively are currently in pre-clinical development for the treatment of anxiety and depression.
the mixed v2/v1a non-peptide antagonist,  xxxd1747xxx  ( xxxd1747xxx ) was approved by the us fda
for i.v. use only in a hospitalized setting for the

treatment of hyponatremia (walter, 2007). the
three non-peptide v2 antagonists (vaptans), currently in clinical trial:  xxxd3399xxx , lixivaptan and
satavaptan (verbalis, 2006) have not yet received
fda approval. the non-peptide v2 agonists and
non-peptide ot agonists currently in pre-clinical
development may offer advantages over desmopressin and ot in certain clinical situations. the
results of eventual clinical trials for these nonpeptide agonists will be awaited with much
interest.
on a somewhat ‘‘back to the future’’ note, it
may be ﬁtting to recall the role that peptides have
played in the development, ‘‘from laboratory to
the bedside’’, of avp  xxxg231xxx  antidiuretic
antagonists (vaptans). this has been a long saga.
the ﬁrst avp antidiuretic  xxxg231xxx  antagonists,
reported over 25 years ago, were peptides (sawyer
et al., 1981). this breakthrough gave rise to the
expectation that it would only be a matter of time
until a peptide v2 antagonist would be developed
as an aquaretic for the treatment of hyponatremia
due to siadh (kinter et al., 1988). studies
carried out in our laboratories and in the smith
kline french laboratory led to two highly
promising candidates (manning et al., 1984;
kinter et al., 1988). however, in pre-clinical
studies with human volunteers, these were found
to be agonists (ruffolo et al., 1991). this highly
unexpected ﬁnding, combined with the discovery
in the otsuka laboratory of non-peptide v1a and
v2 antagonists (yamamura et al., 1991, 1992) led
to the rapid cessation of any further attempts to
develop peptide based v2 antagonists for therapeutic use.
now may be the time to take another look at
peptide v2 antagonists as new ‘‘old’’ therapeutic
agents for the treatment of hyponatremia. as
noted above, the non-peptide v2/v1a antagonist
 xxxd1747xxx  ( xxxd1747xxx ), approved for clinical use
i.v., is not suitable for standard therapy for
siadh. (see pbm drug monograph entitled
‘‘ xxxd1747xxx  hydrochloride injection (vaprisols)’’
on www.pbm.va.gov). likewise, the three nonpeptide v2 antagonists:  xxxd3399xxx , satavaptan
and lixivaptan also possess serious shortcomings
in terms of their efﬁcacy and safety as routine
therapeutic agents for the treatment of siadh

501

and chf. the correspondence following the
salt trial on  xxxd3399xxx  (schrier et al., 2006)
express serious concern on these issues (dawwas,
2007; hoorn and zietse, 2007; ozkan et al., 2007;
weise et al., 2007).
the recent dramatic increase in the number of
peptides which have become available for therapeutic use (verlander, 2005), including the
peptide ot antagonist atosiban (akerlund,
2006), combined with striking advances in peptide
delivery methods (see for example, mehta, 2004;
malik et al., 2007; mastrandrea and quattrin,
2006; purcell et al., 2007), provide compelling
reasons to re-investigate peptide v2 and v2/v1a
antagonists for development as potential aquaretic
agents for the treatment of hyponatremia. also,
as noted above,  xxxd1847xxx  (desmopressin,  xxxd1847xxx ),
for many years used solely as a nasal spray,
is now available in oral form. orally active
desmopressin has been shown to be both safe
and highly efﬁcacious, (lam et al., 1996;
janknegt et al., 1997) and is widely accepted by
clinicians as the drug of choice for treating
central diabetes insipidus (makaryus and
mcfarlane, 2006). this breakthrough in the
development of the peptide v2 agonist,  xxxd1847xxx 
for oral administration provides further convincing evidence that peptide v2 antagonists could
likewise be developed as effective and safe aquaretics for oral administration. our discovery of
the ﬁrst constitutively active human  xxxg231xxx ,
which can discriminate between v2 antagonists
that exhibit partial v2 agonism and v2 antagonists
that are devoid of v2 agonism (morin et al., 1998),
should greatly facilitate the design of peptide v2
antagonists which are effective aquaretics in
humans.
finally, from all of the foregoing, it is
abundantly clear that striking progress has been
made in the design of peptide and non-peptide
ot and avp agonists, antagonists, and their
radiolabelled, ﬂuorescent labelled and bivalent
ligands for use as research tools and therapeutic
agents. however, as also noted above, species
differences and the lack of single v1a, v1b, v2 or
 xxxg1642xxx  speciﬁcity continue to pose serious
and intriguing design challenges. so in a nutshell,
there is still much work to be done and many

more exciting discoveries to be made in this
ﬁeld, especially in the areas of coupling speciﬁc
ligands (reversi et al., 2005; chini and
manning, 2007) and bifunctional ligands (chini
et al., 2007).
