ca2⫹ channels are hetero-oligomeric protein complexes consisting of a pore-forming ␣1-subunit, one out of at least four
␤-subunits (␤1-␤4), an ␣2/␦-subunit, and in skeletal muscle an
additional ␥-subunit (3, 4). the auxiliary channel subunits, in
particular the ␤-subunits, modulate voltage dependence, expression density, and kinetics of ca2⫹ channels (for review see
ref. 4). there is biochemical evidence that multiple ␤-subunits

are associated with the ␣1-subunit, suggesting a tissue-specific
modulation of ca2⫹ channel properties by different ␤-subunit
expression patterns (5, 6).
the ␣1-subunits of l-type ca2⫹ channels (classes c (formed
by ␣1c-subunits), d (formed by ␣1d-subunits), and s (formed by
␣1s-subunits)) possess drug receptors for 1,4-dihydropyridines
(dhps),1 phenylalkylamines, and benzothiazepines (7, 8). mutational analysis of l-type ca2⫹ channel ␣1-subunits revealed
nine amino acid residues in segments iiis5, iiis6, and ivs6
that confer high affinity and stereoselective interaction with
dhps (2, 9 –13).
according to the modulated receptor hypothesis (14), the
interaction of an ion channel blocker with its receptor sites
depends on whether the channel is in a resting (closed), open
(activated), or inactivated (closed) conformational state. this
hypothesis was applied to ca2⫹ channel block by organic calcium channel blockers such as phenylalkylamines, benzothiazepines, and dhps (15, 16). in the frame of a specific version of
the modulated receptor model, the more efficient ca2⫹ channel
inhibition by dhps at depolarized membrane potentials is interpreted as predominant block of inactivated channels. accordingly, stronger dhp antagonist action in the depolarized
vascular tissue was suggested to reflect a more efficient block of
inactivated ca2⫹ channels (but see refs. 17 and 18).
to elucidate the role of the inactivated channel conformation
in the molecular mechanism of ca2⫹ channel block by dhps,
we have designed ca2⫹ channels inactivating at different rates
by co-expressing a l-type channel construct ␣1lc (1) or the
dhp-sensitive class a ca2⫹ channel mutant ␣1a-dhp (2) with
either ␤1a- or ␤2a-subunits. additionally, ca2⫹ channel inactivation was modulated by introducing point mutations into segment ivs6 of ␣1lc. the consequences of changed inactivation
properties for (⫹)-isradipine-induced block were analyzed by
means of the two-microelectrode voltage clamp technique after
expression in xenopus oocytes. we observed no clear correlation between the amount of steady state inactivation and voltagedependent block by (⫹)-isradipine. our data support a hypothesis where the inactivation gating of ca2⫹ channels is
accelerated in their antagonist dhp-bound form. channel constructs with impaired fast inactivation displayed faster recovery from block by (⫹)-isradipine, suggesting a close interdependence between intrinsic inactivation determinants and the (⫹)isradipine-induced inactivated state.

the role of the inactivated channel conformation in
the molecular mechanism of ca2ⴙ channel block by the
1,4-dihydropyridine (dhp) (ⴙ)-isradipine was analyzed
in l-type channel constructs (␣1lc; berjukow, s., gapp,
f., aczel, s., sinnegger, m. j., mitterdorfer, j., glossmann, h., and hering, s. (1999) j. biol. chem. 274, 6154 –
6160) and a dhp-sensitive class a ca2ⴙ channel mutant
(␣1a-dhp; sinnegger, m. j., wang, z., grabner, m., hering,
s., striessnig, j., glossmann, h., and mitterdorfer, j.
(1997) j. biol. chem. 272, 27686 –27693) carrying the high
affinity determinants of the dhp receptor site but inactivating at different rates. ca2ⴙ channel inactivation
was modulated by coexpressing the ␣1a-dhp- or ␣1lc-subunits in xenopus oocytes with either the ␤2a- or the
␤1a-subunit and amino acid substitutions in l-type segment ivs6 (i1497a, i1498a, and v1504a). contrary to a
modulated receptor mechanism assuming high affinity
dhp binding to the inactivated state we observed no
clear correlation between steady state inactivation and
ca2ⴙ channel block by (ⴙ)-isradipine: (i) a 3-fold larger
fraction of ␣1a-dhp/␤1a channels in steady state inactivation at ⴚ80 mv (compared with ␣1a-dhp/␤2a) did not enhance the block by (ⴙ)-isradipine; (ii) different steady
state inactivation of ␣1lc mutants at ⴚ30 mv did not
correlate with voltage-dependent channel block; and
(iii) the midpoint-voltages of the inactivation curves of
slowly inactivating l-type constructs and more rapidly
inactivating ␣1lc/␤1a channels were shifted to a comparable extent to more hyperpolarized voltages. a kinetic
analysis of (ⴙ)-isradipine interaction with different ltype channel constructs revealed a drug-induced inactivated state. entry and recovery from drug-induced inactivation are modulated by intrinsic inactivation
determinants, suggesting a synergism between intrinsic
inactivation and dhp block.

results

␤-subunit regulation of ca2⫹ channel inactivation and
block by (⫹)-isradipine—to evaluate the role of ␤-subunit mediated inactivation in ca2⫹ channel block by isradipine, we
coexpressed the ␣1lc (1) and ␣1a-dhp-subunits (2) together with
either the ␤1a- or the ␤2a-subunit and analyzed peak current
inhibition by its high affinity (⫹)-enantiomer. in line with
previous observations (20), ␣1lc/␤2a channels displayed slower
inactivation kinetics than ␣1lc/␤1a channels (fig. 1). at ⫺80
mv ␣1lc/␤1a channels displayed slightly more steady state inactivation than ␣1lc/␤2a channels (p ⬎ 0.05; fig. 1d). slowly

inactivating ␣1lc/␤2a channels were blocked by (⫹)-isradipine
with a half-maximal inhibitory concentration of 198 ⫾ 35 nm
(n ⫽ 3), which was not statistically different from block of more
rapidly inactivating ␣1lc/␤1a channels (ic50 ⫽ 327 ⫾ 41 nm, p ⬎
0.05; fig. 1a).
the dhp-sensitive class a ca2⫹ channel mutant ␣1a-dhp
inactivates at a faster rate than l-type channels and displays
an inactivation curve that is, compared with l-type channels,
significantly shifted into the hyperpolarizing direction (2). the
slightly higher dhp sensitivity of this channel construct compared with l-type channels could therefore reflect a more efficient drug interaction with the inactivated channel state at
⫺80 mv.
to test this hypothesis we coexpressed the ␣1a-dhp-subunit
with different ␤-subunits and analyzed the (⫹)-isradipine sensitivity of the two channel constructs inactivating at different
rates. as shown for ␣1lc/␤2a (fig. 1b), coexpression of the
␤2a-subunit dramatically slowed the inactivation time course of
the resulting ␣1a-dhp/␤2a channels (fig. 2b). furthermore, at
⫺80 mv we observed a 3-fold larger steady state fraction of
␣1a-dhp/␤1a channels in inactivation (46 ⫾ 2%, n ⫽ 4) than in
␣1a-dhp/␤2a (16 ⫾ 2%, n ⫽ 5, p ⬍ 0.01; fig. 2d). a modulated
receptor mechanism implying high affinity block of inactivated
channels would predict a more pronounced inhibition of ␣1adhp/␤1a channels. the concentration of (⫹)-isradipine for halfmaximal block of iba in ␣1a-dhp/␤1a channels (ic50 ⫽ 61 ⫾ 14,
n ⫽ 4) at ⫺80 mv was, however, not significantly different from
␣1a-dhp/␤2a (ic50 ⫽ 52 ⫾ 14, p ⬎ 0.05; fig. 2a). these data
clearly indicate that enhanced inactivation did not cause stronger iba inhibition of ␣1a-dhp/␤1a channels.
inactivation determinants in segment ivs6 affect ca2⫹
channel block by (⫹)-isradipine—to evaluate the role of channel inactivation determinants in the pore forming ␣1lc-subunit
for channel block by (⫹)-isradipine, we replaced three amino
acids in segment ivs6 of ␣1lc by alanine (i1497a, i1498a, and
v1504a) and analyzed the dhp sensitivity of the resulting
mutants.

nucleotide numbering of ␣lc and mutants derived thereof is according to
␣1c-a cdna sequence (19). all mutations were introduced by polymerase
chain reaction as described previously (10). fragments amplified by
polymerase chain reaction were sequenced entirely to confirm sequence
integrity.
electrophysiology—inward barium currents (iba) were studied with
two microelectrode voltage-clamp of xenopus oocytes 2–7 days after
microinjection of approximately equimolar crna mixtures of ␣1lc or
␣1a-dhp (2) (0.3 ng/50 nl) together with ␣2␦ (0.2 ng/50 nl) and either ␤1a
(0.1 ng/50 nl) or ␤2a (0.1 ng/50 nl) crna as described previously (10).
the corresponding constructs were named ␣1lc/a-dhp/␤1a or ␣1lc/a-dhp/
␤2a channels. mutant ␣1lc-subunits (named herein i1497a, i1498a, and
v1504a; see above) were coexpressed with ␣2␦ and the ␤1a-subunit
exclusively.
all experiments were carried out at room temperature in a bath
solution with the following composition: 40 mm ba(oh)2, 50 mm naoh,
5 mm hepes, 2 mm csoh (ph adjusted to 7.4 with  xxxd390xxx 
acid). voltage recording and current injecting microelectrodes were
filled with 2.8 m cscl, 0.2 m csoh, 10 mm egta, 10 mm hepes (ph
7.4) and had resistances of 0.3–2 m⍀. resting channel block was estimated as peak iba inhibition during 100-ms test pulses from ⫺80 to 20
mv at a frequency of 0.033 hz until steady state was reached. the dose
response curves of iba inhibition were fitted using the hill equation:
iba, drug/iba, control (as percentages) ⫽ (100 ⫺ a)/(1 ⫹ (c/ic50)nh) ⫹ a,
where ic50 is the concentration at which iba inhibition is half-maximal,
c is the applied drug concentration, a is the fraction of iba that is not
blocked, and nh is the hill coefficient.
recovery from inactivation was studied at a holding potential of ⫺80
mv after depolarizing ca2⫹ channels during a 3-s prepulse to 20 mv by
applying 30-ms test pulses (to 20 mv) at various time intervals after the
conditioning prepulse. peak iba values were normalized to the peak
current measured during the prepulse, and the time course of iba
recovery from inactivation was fitted to a mono- or biexponential function (iba, recovery ⫽ a ⫻ exp(⫺t/␶fast) ⫹ b ⫻ exp(⫺t/␶slow) ⫹ c).
voltage dependence of inactivation under quasi-steady state conditions was measured using a multi step protocol to account for run-down
(less than 10%). a control test pulse (50 ms to 20 mv) was followed by
a 1.5-s step to ⫺100 mv followed by a 30-s conditioning step, a 4-ms step
to ⫺100 mv, and a subsequent test pulse to 20 mv (corresponding to the
peak potential of the i-v curves).
inactivation during the 30 s conditioning pulse was calculated as
follows.

isradipine-induced ca2⫹ channel inactivation

tive dhp-binding determinants (i1497a and i1498a; ref. 7)
and mutation v1504a (1) significantly slowed channel inactivation kinetics. none of the point mutations reduced ca2⫹
channel inhibition by (⫹)-isradipine (fig. 3b). instead, we observed a significant decrease in the half-maximal inhibitory
concentrations for peak iba inhibition of i1497a (ic50 ⫽ 28 ⫾
10 nm), i1498a (ic50 ⫽ 50 ⫾ 11 nm), and v1504a (ic50 ⫽ 71 ⫾
15 nm) compared with ␣1lc/␤1a (ic50 ⫽ 327 ⫾ 41 nm, p ⬍ 0.05,
n ⱖ 4; fig. 1).
at a holding potential of ⫺80 mv, the fraction of inactivated
channels was not significantly different between the various
l-type channel constructs (ranging from 5 ⫾ 2% (v1504a, n ⫽
5) to 3 ⫾ 1% (␣1lc/␤1a, n ⫽ 5)). the observed changes in drug
sensitivity at ⫺80 mv appear, therefore, to be associated with
a more pronounced resting channel block.
steady state inactivation and voltage-dependent l-type ca2⫹
channel block—to evaluate the role of the inactivated channel
conformation of our l-type constructs as high affinity receptor
for (⫹)-isradipine, we estimated the steady state inactivation
at ⫺30 mv (see pulse protocol in inset of fig. 4a). different
channel constructs displayed significantly different steady
state inactivation at ⫺30 mv (ranging in the absence of drug
between 9 ⫾ 1% (␣1lc/␤1a, n ⫽ 5) and 21 ⫾ 3% (i1498a, n ⫽ 4))
(fig. 4, c and d).
we did, however, not observe a simple relation between
inactivation and voltage-dependent channel block by (⫹)-isradipine. as illustrated in fig. 4 (a and b), a higher fraction of
steady state inactivation in ␣1lc/␤2a channels did not result in
a stronger voltage-dependent channel block compared with
␣1lc/␤1a channels. compared with its effect on ␣1lc/␤1a channels (56 ⫾ 3% additional current inhibition, n ⫽ 4), the drug
induced significantly less channel block in ␣1lc/␤2a (40 ⫾ 4%),
i1498a (25 ⫾ 2%), and v1504a channels (34 ⫾ 5%, n ⬎ 7; fig.
4c). plotting the fraction of steady state inactivation of the
different l-type channel mutants at ⫺30 mv against the
amount of drug-induced inactivation revealed even a reversed
correlation (r ⫽ 0.94) between these two parameters (fig. 4d).
the different inactivation properties of constructs ␣1lc/␤1a,
␣1lc/␤2a, i1498a, and v1504a prompted us to analyze the voltage dependence of channel inactivation in control and the presence of (⫹)-isradipine in more detail. the inactivation curves

(measured with 30 s conditioning prepulses) in control and the
presence of 10 nm, 100 nm, and 1 ␮m (⫹)-isradipine are illustrated in fig. 5. the midpoint voltages of the inactivation
curves of all four l-type constructs were shifted to a comparable extent in the hyperpolarizing direction (fig. 5 and table i).
a modulated receptor mechanism would predict a correlation
between channel inactivation during the conditioning prepulses and voltage-dependent channel block. no such correlation was observed.
kinetics of drug-induced inactivation at ⫺30 mv—ca2⫹
channel inactivation at ⫺30 mv developed with a biexponential
time course (fig. 4). the fast inactivation time constant (␶fast)
ranged between 0.42 ⫾ 0.06 s (i1497a) and 0.92 ⫾ 0.07 s
(␣1lc/␤2a), and the slow inactivation time constant (␶slow)
ranged between 10.1 ⫾ 2.1 s (i1497a) and 14.0 ⫾ 2.1 s (␣1lc/
␤1a). (⫹)-isradipine (1 ␮m) induced an additional fast component in ca2⫹ channel inactivation developing with similar kinetics as fast inactivation in control. the fast inactivation time
constant (␶fast, isradipine) ranged in the different constructs between 0.51 ⫾ 0.06 s (i1498a) and 0.89 ⫾ 0.08 s (i1497a). the
slow component in channel inactivation at ⫺30 mv was not
significantly affected by the drug (fig. 4, a and b). these
findings suggest that (⫹)-isradipine promotes a channel conformation resembling intrinsic fast inactivation. the fraction of
channels in this new drug-induced inactivated state correlated
with the drug-induced steady state inactivation (fig. 4c).

mutation i1498a reduced ca2⫹ channel inactivation (fig.

␣1lc/␤1a; see also fig. 6c). irrespective of the changes in channel inactivation in i1498a channels, drug-induced acceleration
of the current occurred at a similar rate as in ␣1lc/␤1a channels
(␶fast, isradipine ⫽ 142 ⫾ 18 ms, n ⫽ 6, fig. 6, a and c). thus,
(⫹)-isradipine-induced acceleration of the current decay occurred in all l-type channel constructs at a comparable rate.
recovery from voltage-dependent block by (⫹)-isradipine—
iba recovery of ␣1lc/␤1a channels at ⫺80 mv was well described
by a monoexponential function (␶rec, control ⫽ 0.65 ⫾ 0.07 s, n ⫽

about four times slower (␶rec, drug ⫽ 2.80 ⫾ 0.14 s, n ⫽ 4; fig. 7,
a and e), suggesting that the drug promotes a new (druginduced) inactivated state.
regardless of the complete absence of intrinsic “fast inactivation” in ␣1lc/␤2a and v1504a channels (fig. 6, b and d),
(⫹)-isradipine (1 ␮m) induced a transient component in iba
decay and a corresponding fast component in recovery with
kinetics comparable with drug-modulated ␣1lc/␤1a channels
(␶rec, drug [␣1lc/␤2a] ⫽ 2.26 ⫾ 0.26 s, n ⫽ 3 and ␶rec, drug [v1504a]
⫽ 1.48 ⫾ 0.48 s, n ⫽ 5; fig. 7, c–e).
mutant i1498a recovered with biexponential kinetics in control (fig. 7b). (⫹)-isradipine enhanced the impact of the fast
component (fig. 7f). however, the drug did not slow the time
course of iba recovery in i1498a channels. neither the recovery
time constant from fast inactivation nor recovery from slow
inactivation were significantly affected by (⫹)-isradipine
(␶rec, control ⫽ 471 ⫾ 50 ms, ␶rec, drug ⫽ 453 ⫾ 45 ms, n ⫽ 4; see
also fig. 7, b and e). recovery of i1498a channels from inactivation in the presence of (⫹)-isradipine occurred at a 6-fold
faster rate the recovery of ␣1lc/␤1a channels, suggesting a particularly important role of ile1498 in stabilization of the dhpinduced inactivated state.

according to a widely accepted hypothesis, dhps bind with
high affinity to the inactivated state of ca2⫹ channels (15, 16).
we have revisited this concept and analyzed the (⫹)-isradipine

resting state block by (⫹)-isradipine is affected by mutations in l-type segment ivs6 —our data clearly demonstrate
that two putative dhp binding determinants in segment ivs6

inactivation mechanism (fig. 3a). alanine substitutions of
these amino acids slowed iba inactivation and increased the
apparent dhp sensitivity at ⫺80 mv (fig. 3). slowing the
kinetics of ␣1lc channels by coexpression of the ␤2a-subunit had
no significant effect on iba inhibition (figs. 1 and 3). however,
neither co-expression of the different ␣1lc mutants with the
␤2a-subunit nor introducing point mutations into segment ivs6
significantly affected the steady state fraction of channels in
the inactivated state at ⫺80 mv. our measurements of drug
action at ⫺80 mv therefore primarily provided information

role of inactivation in ␣1a-dhp channel block by (⫹)-isradipine—as illustrated in fig. 2, we estimated at ⫺80 mv an
about 3-fold larger fraction of ␣1a-dhp/␤1a channels in steady
state inactivation than in ␣1a-dhp/␤2a. despite this marked
difference, ␣1a-dhp/␤1a and ␣1a-dhp/␤2a channels were blocked
with similar ic50 values (␣1a-dhp/␤1a, 61 ⫾ 14; ␣1a-dhp/␤2a,
52 ⫾ 14; p ⬎ 0.05).
this result is hard to explain in the frame of a modulated
receptor model suggesting high affinity drug binding to the
inactivated channel conformation. instead, our data clearly
demonstrate that ␤-subunit-induced changes in the steady

representative iba of ␣1lc/␤1a channels during 30-s depolarizations under the same conditions. the time constants of fast (␶fast, middle panels)
and slow (␶slow, right panels) iba decay in control (white columns) and 1
␮m (⫹)-isradipine (black columns) were estimated by fitting biexponential functions to the current traces evoked by 30-s depolarizing pulses
from ⫺80 to 20 mv. data from 6 –12 experiments are shown. no fast
component in inactivation was observed for ␣1lc/␤2a and v1504a. in
␣1lc/␤1a the relative amplitudes changed from afast, control ⫽ 0.50 ⫾ 0.08

state fraction of channel inactivation at ⫺80 mv have no significant effect on (⫹)-isradipine sensitivity of ␣1a-dhp channels.
a higher sensitivity of mutant ␣1a-dhp/␤1a (ic50 ⫽ 61 ⫾ 14)
compared with the l-type construct ␣1lc/␤1a (ic50 ⫽ 327 ⫾ 41,
p ⬍ 0.01) therefore cannot be explained by a high affinity block
of a larger fraction of ␣1a-dhp channels in an inactivated state.
a loss in voltage dependence of dhp block caused by the class
a sequence environment of the dhp-binding site in ␣1a-dhp
cannot be excluded.
role of inactivation in l-type ca2⫹ channel block by (⫹)isradipine—next we exploited the different inactivation properties of our l-type ca2⫹ channel constructs to analyze
whether a larger steady state fraction of inactivated channels
at ⫺30 mv would enhance voltage-dependent channel block. as
shown in fig. 4d, we observed even a reversed correlation
between these two parameters.
this apparent discrepancy with a high affinity drug binding
mechanism to the inactivated channel state is also illustrated
in fig. 5. removal of fast inactivation in v1504a and in ␣1lc/
␤2a channels substantially reduced the fraction of inactivated
channels during the 30-s conditioning pulses compared with
␣1lc/␤1a (fig. 5, a–c). we observed, however, no correlation
between the shifts in the midpoint voltages of the inactivation
curves in the presence of 10 nm to 1 ␮m (⫹)-isradipine (table i)
and the amount of inactivation during a 30-s conditioning test
pulse (more than 90% in ␣1lc/␤1a channels versus about 70% in
␣1lc/␤2a and v1504a channels). these data suggest that drug
binding to the inactivated state is less crucial for l-type channel block than previously supposed.
the kinetics of the voltage-dependent channel block by (⫹)isradipine at ⫺30 mv support, however, the hypothesis that
the drug promotes a conformational state resembling intrinsic
fast inactivation (fig. 4, a and b). as demonstrated in fig. 4,
the formation of this “drug-induced inactivated state” was modulated by intrinsic determinants of fast inactivation in segment
ivs6 and ␣1-␤-subunit interaction.
at 20 mv (⫹)-isradipine (1 ␮m) accelerated the iba decay of
all l-type channel constructs to a comparable extent (fig. 6). at
this potential drug-induced acceleration of the current decay
could be due to rapid open channel block (21), drug-induced
inactivation, or both. it is tempting to speculate that the (⫹)isradipine-induced acceleration of the current decay at 20 mv
at least partially reflects drug-induced transitions of open
channels to an inactivated state that was observed for resting
channels at ⫺30 mv (fig. 4, a and b). however, state transitions of resting channels at ⫺30 mv cannot be extrapolated to
20 mv, where inactivation occurs predominantly from the open
state. more detailed studies including an analysis of the dose
dependence of (⫹)-isradipine-induced changes in iba kinetics at
different membrane voltages are required to answer this
question.
intrinsic inactivation determinants in segment ivs6 affect
recovery from (⫹)-isradipine block—as shown in fig. 7, constructs ␣1lc/␤2a (␶rec, drug ⫽ 2.26 ⫾ 0.23 s, n ⫽ 5) and v1405a

⫺ afast, control) determined from recovery experiments (see a–d). the
fraction of drug-inactivated channels was neither affected by single
point mutations in segment ivs6 nor by expression of different
␤-subunits.

␣1lc/␤1a (␶rec, drug ⫽ 2.80 ⫾ 0.14 s, n ⫽ 4, p ⫽ 0.05). most
dramatic effects were observed for amino acid substitution
i1498a. this mutant recovered in (⫹)-isradipine much faster
from inactivation (␶rec, drug ⫽ 0.45 ⫾ 0.05 s, n ⫽ 4) than ␣1lc/␤1a
and the other constructs (fig. 7e). this property distinguishes
ile1498 from other ivs6 residues investigated in the present
study (fig. 7b). a simple interpretation of these results is that
mutation i1498a and to a lesser extent mutation v1405a and
the ␣1lc-␤2a interaction destabilize the drug-induced inactivated state (fig. 8).
implications for the molecular mechanism of dhp action—a
role of channel inactivation determinants in different sequence
stretches of l-type and non-l-type ␣1-subunits in block by

dhps was earlier reported by zuhlke et al. (22), lacinova et al.
(23), and bodi et al. (24).
an interesting question about the interaction of dhps with
ca2⫹ channels is whether these drugs bind with high affinity to
the inactivated state or whether the inactivation gating of the
channels in their drug-bound form is changed. in his original
work on the modulated receptor hypothesis, hille (25) stressed
both ways of expressing the concept of the modulated receptor
hypothesis.
the aim of the present study was to distinguish the impact of
drug binding to the inactivated state from drug-induced inactivation by making use of dhp-sensitive ca2⫹ channel constructs with different inactivation properties. we report here
almost identical (⫹)-isradipine sensitivity of ␣1a-dhp/␤1a and
␣1a-dhp/␤2a channels despite the pronounced differences in
steady state inactivation (fig. 2). for our l-type mutants, we
observed at ⫺30 mv even a reversed correlation between the
different channel fractions in inactivation and voltage-dependent channel block (fig. 4d). both findings are inconsistent with
a modulated receptor mechanism implying an interdependence
between high affinity dhp-binding to ca2⫹ channels in an
inactivated state and drug-induced inactivation.
we hypothesize that drug-induced changes in the availability curve reflect the formation of a new (⫹)-isradipine-induced
inactivated channel conformation. recovery from drug-induced
inactivation is modulated by intrinsic inactivation determinants, suggesting a synergism between both processes (most
prominent for mutation i1498a).
the possible structural implications of our data are hard to
interpret. on one hand, this interrelationship may indicate that
conformational changes during channel inactivation modulate
the orientation of dhp-binding determinants; on the other hand,
they may also reflect an overlap between drug binding and
inactivation determinants (see fig. 8 for illustration).
in conclusion, dhp-sensitive ca2⫹ channel constructs with
different inactivation properties represent valuable tools for
studying the role of the inactivated channel conformation in
dhp block. the characterization of the drug-induced inactivated conformational state(s) and the identification of further
structural links between the dhp-binding sites and intrinsic

of the (ⴙ)-isradipine-induced channel conformation. slower iba
recovery of l-type ca2⫹ channels in the presence of (⫹)-isradipine
suggests that the drug stabilizes a new inactivated channel conformation (fig. 7a; see also ref. 26). the scheme illustrates an interdependence between intrinsic inactivation properties and the stability of the
(⫹)-isradipine-induced conformation. amino acid substitution i1498a
induced a 6-fold faster iba recovery from the drug-induced state, and an
about 2-fold faster recovery was observed for mutant v1504a. faster
recovery of ␣1lc/␤2a channels was significant (compared with ␣1lc/␤1a)
but less pronounced (fig. 7; see also ref. 26).
