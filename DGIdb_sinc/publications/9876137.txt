abstract cocaine block of human cardiac ( xxxg2028xxx ) and rat skeletal (␮1) muscle sodium channels was examined under
whole-cell voltage clamp in transiently transfected hek293t cells. low affinity block of resting ␮1 and  xxxg2028xxx  channels at ⫺180
mv was the same, and high affinity block of inactivated channels at ⫺70 mv was the same. cocaine block of  xxxg2028xxx  channels
was greater than block of ␮1 channels at voltages between ⫺120 mv and ⫺90 mv, suggesting that greater steady-state
inactivation of  xxxg2028xxx  channels in this voltage range makes them more susceptible to cocaine block. we induced shifts in the
voltage dependence of steady-state inactivation at ␮1 and  xxxg2028xxx  channels by constructing ␮1/ xxxg2028xxx  channel chimeras or by
coexpressing the wild-type channels with the rat brain ␤1 subunit. in contrast to several previous reports, coexpression of the
rat brain ␤1 subunit with ␮1 or  xxxg2028xxx  produced large positive shifts in steady-state inactivation. shifts in the voltage
dependence of steady-state inactivation elicited linear shifts in steady-state cocaine block, yet these manipulations did not
affect the cocaine affinity of resting or inactivated channels. these data, as well as simulations used to predict block, indicate
that state-dependent cocaine block depends on both steady-state inactivation and channel activation, although inactivation
appears to have the predominant role.

introduction
sodium channels are voltage-sensitive membrane proteins
that produce the action potentials in excitable tissues such as
nerve, skeletal muscle, and cardiac muscle. with sufficient
depolarization from the resting potential, sodium channels
activate, open, and allow sodium ion flux. within a few
milliseconds of opening, the channels inactivate and return
to a nonconducting state (hodgkin and huxley, 1952). the
general structure of the sodium channel isoforms from different excitable tissues appears to be conserved (catterall,
1995; fozzard and hanck, 1996). sodium channel ␣ subunits consist of four homologous domains (d1–d4), and
each domain contains six transmembrane segments (s1–
s6). the arrangement of the four domain regions in the
membrane forms a pore for conducting sodium ions.
although the structures of the different tissue isoforms of
sodium channel are generally similar, there are marked
differences among the isoforms in kinetic behavior and
pharmacology. compared to skeletal muscle sodium channels, cardiac sodium channels activate and inactivate at
more negative membrane potentials and have a slower time
constant of macroscopic current decay when expressed in
mammalian cells (wang et al., 1996a; wright et al., 1997).
pharmacological differences between cardiac and skeletal
muscle sodium channels include a relatively greater sensi-

tivity of the cardiac muscle isoform to cd2⫹ ions and a
lower sensitivity to tetrodotoxin (frelin et al., 1986). while
the residues responsible for cd2⫹ and tetrodotoxin block
have been delineated (tomaselli et al., 1995), sodium channel block by local anesthetics is less clearly understood
because channel affinity profoundly varies depending on
channel state.
the two principal models used to explain the state-dependent modulation of receptor affinity are the modulated
receptor hypothesis (hille, 1977) and the guarded receptor hypothesis (starmer et al., 1984). in hille’s (1977)
modulated receptor scheme, the inactivation particle (h
gate) accounted for the state-dependent alterations in receptor affinity. in contrast, starmer et al. (1984) attributed
state-dependent alterations in receptor affinity to the activation particle (m gate). a clear determination of which
mechanism is responsible for receptor modulation might
help explain why some local anesthetics, such as cocaine or
lidocaine, strongly affect cardiac physiology at concentrations that have little obvious effect on skeletal muscle
physiology.
the purpose of the present study was to examine the
mechanisms that influence channel affinity and state-dependent cocaine block of skeletal muscle and cardiac sodium
channels. two previous studies suggested that the anesthetic receptor in cardiac sodium channels has a higher
affinity for lidocaine than does the receptor in skeletal
muscle sodium channels, and that this difference in receptor
affinity accounts for the difference in lidocaine sensitivity
between cardiac and skeletal muscle tissue (nuss et al.,
1995b; wang et al., 1996b). in contrast, we have recently
shown that mammalian cardiac ( xxxg2028xxx ) and skeletal muscle
sodium channels (␮1) have very similar affinities for co-

caine and for lidocaine (wright et al., 1997). at intermediate voltages (⫺120 mv to ⫺90 mv), however, cocaine
blocked  xxxg2028xxx  channels with much greater potency, suggesting that the modulation of receptor affinity differs at the two
isoforms. although we lacked direct evidence to support our
hypothesis, we suggested that cocaine blocked a larger
proportion of  xxxg2028xxx  channels than ␮1 channels at intermediate voltages because of greater steady-state inactivation of
the  xxxg2028xxx  isoform (wright et al., 1997). to test this hypothesis, we induced shifts in steady-state inactivation by creating ␮1/ xxxg2028xxx  channel chimeras and also by coexpressing
the rat brain ␤1 subunit with the ␣ subunits of  xxxg2028xxx  or ␮1.
in stark contrast to data from other expression systems
(isom et al., 1992, 1995; nuss et al., 1995a), we found that
␤1 subunit coexpression induced strong positive shifts in
the steady-state inactivation of both  xxxg2028xxx  and ␮1 channels.
when we plotted the midpoint voltages of steady-state
cocaine block as a function of the midpoint voltages of
either steady-state activation or inactivation, we found that
the relationship between block and steady-state inactivation
was linear, and that block was better correlated with steadystate inactivation than with activation. in simulations of
block, steady-state cocaine block of each channel could be
fairly well predicted by using the steady-state inactivation
curve of each channel and the kd values of resting and
inactivated channels. the fit by the model was further
improved by imposing an equilibrium shift in the steadystate inactivation curve. these data and the model suggested
that the modulation of local anesthetic receptor affinity
depends heavily on steady-state inactivation and perhaps to
some extent on channel activation resulting from the coupling between inactivation and activation. some of the
presented data have appeared in an abstract (wright et al.,
1998).

⫹1n. the ␮1(1–3) xxxg2028xxx (4) channel was cloned by ligating the large ␮1 clai
fragment (domains 1–3) to the small  xxxg2028xxx  clai fragment (domain 3 and 4
cytoplasmic linker and domain 4).
the chimera, ␮1(1) xxxg2028xxx (2– 4), was created by using the bsiwi site (at
positions 1328 –1333) of ␮1-cdna1/amp. this restriction site in ␮1 is
located at the 3⬘ end junction of the domain 1 s6 segment. because  xxxg2028xxx 
lacks this bsiwi site, we performed site-directed mutagenesis at the 3⬘ end
junction of the domain 1 s6 segment of  xxxg2028xxx  (at positions 1252–1257) to
create the clone  xxxg2028xxx -bsiwi ( xxxg2028xxx  also has a bsiwi restriction site in the 3⬘
polylinker). three-way ligation was used to join dna fragments: 1.7
kb-hindiii-bsiwi from ␮1-cdna1/amp, 4 kb-bsiwi from  xxxg2028xxx -bsiwi,
and 5 kb-hindiii-bsiwi from  xxxg2028xxx -bsiwi. the orientations of
␮1(1–3) xxxg2028xxx (4), ␮1(1) xxxg2028xxx (2– 4), and of two other channel chimeras
( xxxg2028xxx (1–3)␮1(4) and  xxxg2028xxx (1)␮1(2– 4)) were determined by restriction mapping
and sequencing. introduction of the restriction sites for chimera formation
did not produce point mutations in either the ␮1 or the  xxxg2028xxx  portion of
channel chimeras.

channel expression in hek 293t cells
the methods used for maintaining transformed human embryonic kidney
(hek 293t) cells and for transiently expressing ␮1 (trimmer et al., 1989)
and  xxxg2028xxx  (gellens et al., 1992) were described in a previous paper (wright
et al., 1997). for transient expression of the ␣ subunits of cloned channels
in hek cells, we prepared the following dna solution (cannon and
strittmatter, 1993): 1 ␮g cd8 (cell surface antigen) and 2–10 ␮g sodium
channel cdna clone in the pcdna1/amp vector (invitrogen, san diego,
ca) were prepared in 250 mm cacl2 and added to a test tube containing
0.36 ml hanks’ balanced salt (2⫻) solution (in mm: 274 nacl, 40 hepes,
12 dextrose, 10 kcl, 1.4 na2hpo4, ph 7.05). after a 20-min incubation at
22°c, the dna solution was added to a cell culture (in a ti-25 flask) that
was 30 –50% confluent. after 15 h at 37°c, the transfected cells were
replated onto 35-mm culture dishes (which also served as recording chambers) containing 2 ml fresh dmem supplemented with taurine (1%),
penicillin/streptomycin (1%), and heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum
(10%). for coexpression of the rat brain ␤1 subunit (isom et al., 1992) with
␮1 or  xxxg2028xxx  ␣ subunits, saturating levels (⬎10-fold molar excess) of ␤1
cdna were used to ensure that the resulting macroscopic currents were
produced by channels consisting of both ␣ and ␤1 subunits.

materials and methods
solutions and chemicals

electrophysiology procedures and data analysis

the extracellular solution used to perfuse hek cells contained (in mm): 65
nacl, 85 choline chloride, 2 cacl2, and 10 hepes (titrated with tetramethyl ammonium hydroxide to ph 7.4). the pipette solution contained (in
mm) 100 naf, 30 nacl, 10 egta, and 10 hepes (titrated with cesium
hydroxide to ph 7.2).  xxxd1736xxx  was purchased from
mallinckrodt, inc. (st. louis, mo), and was stored at ⫺20°c as a 200 mm
solution in distilled water. final anesthetic concentrations were obtained by
serial dilution from a 10 mm stock solution prepared in external bathing
solution.

whole-cell voltage clamp (hamill et al., 1981) of hek cells was used to
study macroscopic sodium currents at room temperature (23 ⫾ 2°c).
electrode resistances ranged from 0.4 to 1.0 m⍀. command voltages were
programmed by pclamp software and delivered by a list epc7 voltage
clamp. data were sampled at 50 khz and were filtered at 5 khz. after
gigaohm seal formation and establishment of whole-cell voltage clamp, the
cells were always dialyzed for 25–30 min before acquiring data. timedependent shifts in the midpoint voltage of sodium channel availability
during our experiments (⬃30 – 60 min after membrane rupture) would have
been ⬃5–7 mv (wang et al., 1996a). the holding potential for all experiments was ⫺140 mv. most of the capacitative current was canceled by the
epc7 circuitry. the remaining capacitative artifact and the leakage current
were subtracted by the p/⫺4 method. the p/⫺4 method was not used for
studies of use-dependent cocaine block. voltage errors at ⫹30 mv were
ⱕ5 mv after 30 –50% compensation. least-squares curve fitting was
performed with microcal origin software. depending on the experiment,
data were fitted by an empirical boltzmann function {1/[1 ⫹ exp((v0.5 ⫺
v)/k)]}, where v0.5 is the midpoint voltage of the function and k is the
slope factor (in mv/e-fold change in current); by a single exponential
function {y0 ⫹ a1*[1⫺exp(⫺x/␶1)]}; or by the sum of two exponential
functions {y0 ⫹ a1*[1⫺exp(⫺x/␶1)] ⫹ a2*[1⫺exp(⫺x/␶2)]}. data are
presented as mean ⫾ se.

construction of ␮1/ xxxg2028xxx  channel chimeras
for ␮1(1–3) xxxg2028xxx (4), site-directed mutagenesis (wang and wang, 1997) was
used to create a clai site at positions 3862–3867 of the ␮1-cdna1/amp
vector (the translation initiation site was at ⫹1n) by converting c into t at
position 3867n. the ␮1-clai-3862 was further modified into ␮1-clai-clai
by introducing another clai site in the 3⬘ polylinker. this was achieved by
the digestion of ␮1-clai-3862 with sali, followed by a blunting reaction
and ligation to the clai linker.  xxxg2028xxx -clai was created by mutating the
attgac (4416 – 4421n) in the  xxxg2028xxx  clone (gellens et al., 1992) into a clai
site: atcgat. the translation initiation site in the  xxxg2028xxx  clone is at position

cocaine block of sodium channels

results
role of domain regions in sodium channel
activation and inactivation
previous studies indicated that steady-state inactivation of
␮1/ xxxg2028xxx  channel chimeras differed from the steady-state
inactivation of the wild-type isoforms (makita et al., 1996;
chahine et al., 1996; benzinger et al., 1997). our goal was
to induce voltage-dependent shifts in steady-state channel
activation or inactivation in an attempt to determine how
shifts in channel kinetics might affect steady-state cocaine
block. fig. 1 a shows current records obtained from the two
wild-type sodium channels, ␮1 and  xxxg2028xxx , and from two
channel chimeras. the ␮1 panel shows the four domains
(d1–d4) of the sodium channel ␣ subunit, the charged (⫹)
s4 segments in each domain, and the amino and carboxyl
termini. the channel chimera, ␮1(1–3) xxxg2028xxx (4), contained domains 1–3 from the ␮1 ␣ subunit and domain 4 from the
 xxxg2028xxx  ␣ subunit, whereas ␮1(1) xxxg2028xxx (2– 4) contained domain 1
from ␮1 and domains 2– 4 from  xxxg2028xxx . despite repeated
attempts, two other channel chimeras,  xxxg2028xxx (1)␮1(2– 4) and
 xxxg2028xxx (1–3)␮1(4), failed to express current. to evoke the currents shown in fig. 1 a, we delivered 10-ms step depolarizations from a holding potential of ⫺140 mv. the inward
currents for ␮1, ␮1(1–3) xxxg2028xxx (4), and ␮1(1) xxxg2028xxx (2– 4) channels
peaked at ⫺30 mv, whereas the peak inward current for
 xxxg2028xxx  channels occurred at ⫺40 mv. the time dependence of
macroscopic current decay for both ␮1(1–3) xxxg2028xxx (4) and
␮1(1) xxxg2028xxx (2– 4) channels clearly resembled the decay of  xxxg2028xxx 
currents, which decayed more slowly than the ␮1 current.
at ⫹30 mv, ␮1 current decayed with a time constant of
0.28 ⫾ 0.01 ms (n ⫽ 7). in contrast,  xxxg2028xxx , ␮1(1–3) xxxg2028xxx (4), and
␮1(1) xxxg2028xxx (2– 4) currents decayed with time constants of
0.49 ⫾ 0.03 ms (n ⫽ 6), 0.46 ⫾ 0.02 ms (n ⫽ 11), and
0.41 ⫾ 0.01 ms (n ⫽ 13), respectively.
parts b and c in fig. 1 show the normalized membrane
conductance and steady-state inactivation curves, respectively, for ␮1(1–3) xxxg2028xxx (4) and ␮1(1) xxxg2028xxx (2– 4) channels. these
data were fitted with an empirical boltzmann function (solid
lines) to determine the midpoint voltage (v0.5) and the slope
factor (k). for comparison, the fitted boltzmann functions
(dotted lines) for  xxxg2028xxx  and ␮1 channels (wright et al., 1997)
are also shown in parts b and c. the activation (i.e., the
conductance-voltage relationship) of both ␮1(1–3) xxxg2028xxx (4) and
␮1(1) xxxg2028xxx (2– 4) channels more closely resembled the activation of ␮1 channels (fig. 1 b). the v0.5 value of channel
activation for  xxxg2028xxx  channels was significantly (p ⬍ 0.05;
t-test) more negative than were the v0.5 values of activation
for ␮1, ␮1(1–3) xxxg2028xxx (4), or ␮1(1) xxxg2028xxx (2– 4) channels, whereas
the v0.5 values of activation for ␮1(1–3) xxxg2028xxx (4) or
␮1(1) xxxg2028xxx (2– 4) were not significantly different (p ⬎ 0.05)
from that of ␮1 (table 1).
we examined the steady-state inactivation properties of
these four sodium channel isoforms by using a standard h⬁
pulse protocol. we delivered 100 ms conditioning pulses of
various amplitudes and measured the available sodium cur-

235

rent during a test pulse to ⫹30 mv (fig. 1 c, inset). the plot
in fig. 1 c shows the averaged data for the channel chimeras and the solid lines represent the fits by a boltzmann
function. the dotted lines are the fits to the averaged  xxxg2028xxx 
and ␮1 data. the v0.5 values of steady-state inactivation of
␮1(1–3) xxxg2028xxx (4) and ␮1(1) xxxg2028xxx (2– 4) channels fell between the
v0.5 values of inactivation for  xxxg2028xxx  and ␮1, with ␮1(1–3) xxxg2028xxx (4)
more closely resembling ␮1 and ␮1(1) xxxg2028xxx (2– 4) more closely
resembling  xxxg2028xxx  (table 1). consistent with a previous report
that used the oocyte expression system to examine inactivation (makita et al., 1996), the data in fig. 1 c suggest that
all four domain regions contribute, perhaps equally, to the
voltage dependence of steady-state inactivation.

cocaine block of ␮1,  xxxg2028xxx , and chimeras
as described above, chimera formation had distinct effects
on channel activation and steady-state inactivation. the v0.5
values of activation for both channel chimeras resembled
that of ␮1, but the v0.5 values of steady-state inactivation
for the chimeras were intermediate to those of ␮1 and  xxxg2028xxx .
we compared the steady-state cocaine block of the four
channels to perhaps distinguish whether the inactivation
phenotype or the activation phenotype has the more prominent role in determining steady-state cocaine block. cocaine binds to the channels with a stoichiometry of 1:1, so
we measured 30 ␮m cocaine block of the channels over a
110 mv range of conditioning voltages. by using this approach, we were able to examine block of resting channels
at the most negative conditioning voltages, block of inactivated channels at the least negative voltages, and block of
varying proportions of resting and inactivated channels at
intermediate voltages. the pulse protocol (fig. 1 d, inset)
consisted of a 10-s conditioning pulse ranging from ⫺180
mv to ⫺70 mv followed by a 100-ms interval at the
holding potential and a subsequent test pulse to ⫹30 mv.
as previously described (wright et al., 1997), a conditioning pulse of 10 s was necessary and sufficient for cocaine
block to reach steady state at all of the channels in the study
(n ⫽ 2–3 cells; data not shown). a 100-ms interval inserted
between the conditioning pulse and the test pulse allowed
drug-free channels to recover from fast inactivation. to
normalize the data at each conditioning voltage, we divided
the peak current amplitude at the test pulse in the presence
of cocaine by the peak current amplitude elicited by the test
pulse in control saline. at strongly negative conditioning
pulses, 30 ␮m cocaine blocked ⬃10% of the resting
␮1(1–3) xxxg2028xxx (4) and ␮1(1) xxxg2028xxx (2– 4) channels, which was similar to the block of resting ␮1 and  xxxg2028xxx  channels. when the
channel chimeras were inactivated by a 10-s conditioning
pulse to ⫺70 mv, 30 ␮m cocaine blocked ⬃75– 80% of the
channels, which was similar to the block of inactivated ␮1
and  xxxg2028xxx  channels. as with the wild-type channels, 300 ␮m
cocaine blocked ⬃55% of the resting channels and ⬃97%
of the inactivated channels (wright et al., 1997). at ⫺180
mv, 300 ␮m cocaine blocked 55.5 ⫾ 1.7% (n ⫽ 5) of

there was no significant difference (p ⬎ 0.05) in block
between the two chimeras; nor was there a difference between the block of the chimeras and block of the wild-type
channels. at intermediate voltages, where there was a mixture of resting and inactivated channels, the relative differences in 30 ␮m cocaine block among the four channels
(fig. 1 d) generally resembled the differences among the
channels in steady-state inactivation (fig. 1 c). note that
cocaine block of the ␮1(1–3) xxxg2028xxx (4) chimera, which has domain 4 from  xxxg2028xxx  and thus the putative local anesthetic
receptor for  xxxg2028xxx  (ragsdale et al., 1994), more closely
resembled cocaine block of ␮1 channels. the differences in
steady-state inactivation therefore provided a reasonable
correlation for the observed differences in steady-state cocaine block.
effects of ␤1 subunit coexpression on channel
kinetics and cocaine block
in other expression systems, coexpression of the rat brain
␤1 subunit with the ␣ subunit of sodium channels most
often shifted channel kinetics toward more negative voltages. in xenopus oocytes, coexpression of the ␤1 subunit
with the ␣ subunits of rat brain iia (isom et al., 1992) or ␮1
(nuss et al., 1995a) sodium channels increased current
amplitude, speeded the rate of current decay, and shifted the
voltage dependence of steady-state inactivation to more
negative voltages. in chinese hamster cells, ␤1 subunit
coexpression with the rat brain iia ␣ subunit caused negative shifts in both activation and inactivation, but did not
obviously affect the rate of current decay (isom et al., 1995).
furthermore, in the oocyte expression system ␤1 subunit
coexpression with  xxxg2028xxx  channels reduced the resting affinity
for lidocaine by twofold (makielski et al., 1996).
our first objective was to determine what effect, if any,
␤1 subunit coexpression had on the channel kinetics of ␮1
or  xxxg2028xxx  when expressed in hek cells. although ␤1 coexpression with ␮1 and  xxxg2028xxx  in hek cells increased current

amplitude as in other expression systems, there were surprisingly different effects on channel activation and inactivation. the v0.5 values of activation for ␮1-␤1 and  xxxg2028xxx -␤1
were 2 mv and 5 mv, respectively, more positive than the
v0.5 values of activation for the ␣ subunits alone (fig. 2 a).
compared to the v0.5 values of activation for ␮1 and  xxxg2028xxx  ␣
subunits, the positive shift was modest (␮1 versus ␮1-␤1,
p ⬎ 0.05;  xxxg2028xxx  versus  xxxg2028xxx -␤1, p ⫽ 0.05). ␤1 subunit
coexpression had virtually no effect on the time constant of
macroscopic current decay during depolarizations to between 0 and ⫹50 mv (fig. 2 b). coexpression of the ␤1
subunit with ␮1 and  xxxg2028xxx  channels induced strong positive
shifts in the v0.5 values of steady-state inactivation, as
compared to expression of the ␣ subunits alone (fig. 2 c).
for ␮1-␤1 and  xxxg2028xxx -␤1, the v0.5 values of inactivation
were, respectively, 10 mv (p ⬍ 0.05) and 13 mv (p ⬍ 0.05)
more positive than the v0.5 values of ␮1 and  xxxg2028xxx  (table 1).
because ␤ subunit coexpression with ␮1 and  xxxg2028xxx  elicited
strong positive shifts in steady-state inactivation and modest
shifts in channel activation, we examined whether the ␤1
subunit altered the relationship between the conditioning
voltage and cocaine block. consistent with the effect on
steady-state inactivation, ␤1 subunit coexpression with ␮1
and  xxxg2028xxx  induced strong positive shifts in the v0.5 values of
cocaine block. (fig. 2 d). we changed the voltage range
over which we examined cocaine block by 20 mv in the
positive direction. because the change in pulse protocol
elicited more slow inactivation from ␮1-␤1 channels than
from  xxxg2028xxx -␤1 channels, we normalized the block at each
conditioning voltage by dividing the amplitude of the test
current evoked in 30 ␮m cocaine by the amplitude of the
test current evoked in control saline. the v0.5 values of
steady-state cocaine block at ␮1-␤1 and at  xxxg2028xxx -␤1 were 12
mv and 15 mv, respectively, more positive than the v0.5
values of cocaine block at ␮1 and  xxxg2028xxx . compared to block
of the ␣ subunits of ␮1 and  xxxg2028xxx , coexpression of the ␤1
subunit did not significantly (p ⬎ 0.05) alter the percentages
of resting or inactivated channels blocked by either 30 ␮m
(fig. 2 d) or 300 ␮m cocaine. at ⫺160 mv, 300 ␮m

(n ⫽ 4) of inactivated ␮1-␤1 and  xxxg2028xxx -␤1 channels, respectively. thus, coexpression of the ␤1 subunit with ␮1 or  xxxg2028xxx 
did not alter the cocaine affinities of either resting or inactivated channels. for the six sodium channels listed in table
1, we plotted the v0.5 values of cocaine block as a function
of their respective v0.5 values of activation and inactivation
(fig. 3). regression analyses showed that the voltage dependence of steady-state cocaine block was better correlated
with the voltage dependence of steady-state inactivation
(r ⫽ 0.98) than with channel activation (r ⫽ 0.66).
comparison of block recovery and usedependent block at ␮1 and  xxxg2028xxx  channels
while the steady-state interactions between cocaine and
cardiac sodium channels appear to be important in cocaineinduced cardiotoxicity, other interactions between cocaine
and cardiac sodium channels may augment the cardiotoxic

effects of cocaine. the fact that cardiac excitability is rhythmic and that cardiac cells spend more time than other
sodium channel isoforms in the inactivated state suggests
that the recovery time course from inactivated channel
block and/or use-dependent block of cardiac sodium channels by local anesthetics may influence the net effects of
cocaine. we therefore examined the recovery time course
from cocaine block or in the extent of use-dependent block.
to determine the unbinding rate of cocaine from inactivated ␮1 and  xxxg2028xxx  channels, we delivered a 10-s conditioning pulse to ⫺70 mv and measured the time-dependent
recovery of current at ⫺140 mv (fig. 4, inset). the data
obtained in control saline (filled symbols) showed that, in
addition to eliciting fast inactivation, the conditioning pulse
produced a slight amount of slow inactivation of both ␮1
and  xxxg2028xxx  channels. for both ␮1 and  xxxg2028xxx , the recovery from
inactivation was best fitted by the sum of two exponentials.
in control saline, the fast time constant of recovery was

steady-state inactivation and activation of the channels. the error bars for
the x-axis correspond to the standard errors of the averaged v0.5 values of

that the v0.5 values of cocaine block were better correlated with the v0.5

steady state activation (r ⫽ 0.66).

1.0 ⫾ 0.1 ms (n ⫽ 5) for ␮1 channels and was 6.3 ⫾ 0.4 ms
(n ⫽ 6) for  xxxg2028xxx  channels. these recovery rates were similar
to the recovery rates for ␮1 (1.5 ⫾ 0.1 ms; n ⫽ 5) and  xxxg2028xxx 
(4.3 ⫾ 0.7 ms; n ⫽ 6) after delivery of a 10-ms conditioning
pulse to ⫹30 mv. in control saline (see fig. 6, filled
symbols), the fast phase of recovery from inactivation for
␮1 and  xxxg2028xxx  channels comprised 81.2 ⫾ 1.3% and 87.9 ⫾
1.9%, respectively, of the fractional amplitudes of recovery.
the slow time constants of recovery for ␮1 and  xxxg2028xxx  channels were 279.1 ⫾ 40.5 ms and 724.9 ⫾ 190.0 ms (p ⫽
0.07), respectively.
the recovery from 30 ␮m cocaine block also was best
described as the sum of two exponentials. the fractional
amplitudes of the fast time constants of recovery from
cocaine block of ␮1 and  xxxg2028xxx  channels were 26.3 ⫾ 1.4%
and 27.5 ⫾ 1.4% (p ⬎ 0.05), respectively. as with recovery
from lidocaine block (wright et al., 1997), we assumed that
the fast time constants of recovery in the presence of 30 ␮m
cocaine represented the recovery of drug-free channels and
that the fractional amplitude of block at the conclusion of
the fast phase of recovery represented block of inactivated
channels. the fast time constants of recovery for ␮1 and
 xxxg2028xxx  were 2.0 ⫾ 0.2 ms and 11.5 ⫾ 1.5 ms, respectively.
this slowing of the fast time constant of recovery in the
presence of cocaine also occurs in the presence of lidocaine
and its quaternary derivatives (yeh and tanguy, 1985) and
suggests that local anesthetics might affect the recovery
from inactivation at “drug-free” channels by binding to
them at various time points of the recovery phase. the time
constant of recovery from cocaine block was similar for the
two channels and required several seconds. the time constants of recovery from 30 ␮m cocaine block of ␮1 and  xxxg2028xxx 
channels were 6.5 ⫾ 0.4 s (n ⫽ 5) and 6.8 ⫾ 0.5 s (n ⫽ 6;
p ⬎ 0.5), respectively. these values were consistent with
the time constant of cocaine unbinding from ventricular
myocyte sodium channels (crumb and clarkson, 1990).

current. the recovery time courses in control saline (filled symbols) and in
30 ␮m cocaine (open symbols) were best fitted by the sum of two
exponentials. in control saline, ␮1 channels recovered with fast and slow
time constants of 1.0 ⫾ 0.1 ms and 279.1 ⫾ 40.5 ms, respectively, and the
fractional amplitude of the fast time constant comprised 81.2 ⫾ 1.3% of the

and 724.9 ⫾ 190.0 ms, respectively, and the fractional amplitude of the fast

constant was 26.3 ⫾ 1.4% of the recovery;  xxxg2028xxx  channels recovered with

we compared use-dependent cocaine block of ␮1 and
 xxxg2028xxx  channels using 1 and 2 hz stimulation rates (fig. 5) but
found no difference between the channels in the extent of
use-dependent block. cells were held at ⫺140 mv and
received 25 ms pulses to ⫹30 mv. little use-dependent
decrease in ␮1 or  xxxg2028xxx  sodium current occurred during 1- or
2-hz stimulation in control saline, whereas repetitive pulses
delivered in 30 ␮m cocaine produced potent use-dependent
block. use-dependent block of ␮1 and  xxxg2028xxx  channels by 30
␮m cocaine was fitted by a single exponential function. the
percentages of steady-state block at 1- and 2-hz stimulation
were 39.4 ⫾ 1.8% and 50.1 ⫾ 1.6%, respectively, for ␮1
channels and were 41.5 ⫾ 1.7% and 53.2 ⫾ 1.3%, respectively, for  xxxg2028xxx  channels. the difference in the percentage of
steady-state block between ␮1 and  xxxg2028xxx  at either 1- or 2-hz
stimulation was not statistically significant (p ⬎ 0.05).
although increasing the duration of the depolarization
would have increased the percentage of block at steady
state, the relative similarities in use-dependent block of ␮1
and  xxxg2028xxx  channels would not likely have changed. when we
delivered a single conditioning pulse to ⫹30 mv for 300 ms
followed by a 100-ms interval at the holding potential and a
test pulse to ⫹30 mv, cocaine blocked a similar percentage
of ␮1 channels (29.7 ⫾ 2.0%; n ⫽ 7) and  xxxg2028xxx  channels
(24.6 ⫾ 1.0%; n ⫽ 5; p ⬎ 0.05). although there were no
significant differences between ␮1 and  xxxg2028xxx  in the time
course of recovery from block or in use-dependent block,

more, the shifts in steady-state inactivation did not alter the
affinities of resting and inactivated channels. to determine
whether we could predict the voltage dependence of cocaine
block, we used the steady-state inactivation data from each
channel, as well as the kr and ki values to simulate steadystate cocaine block. for the simulation, we first determined
the apparent kd using the h⬁ curve of each channel. that is,

1/kapp ⫽ h/kr ⫹ 共1 ⫺ h兲/ki

(1)

where kapp is the apparent kd, and kr and ki are the kd
values at resting and inactivated channels, respectively. the
parameters h and 1 ⫺ h are the fractional distributions of
resting and inactivated channels, respectively, at a given
conditioning voltage (bean et al., 1983). we used 250 ␮m
as the kr value and 9 ␮m as the ki value. note that in eq.
1 the fraction of inactivated channels (1 ⫺ h) has a larger
influence on the apparent kd than does the fraction of
available channels (h), and thus imposes a leftward shift on
the simulation. for example, at the conditioning voltage
where h ⫽ 0.9 and 1 ⫺ h ⫽ 0.1, the apparent kd is 68 ␮m;
when both h and 1 ⫺ h ⫽ 0.5, the apparent kd is 17 ␮m.
fig. 6 a shows the kapp curves for ␮1 and  xxxg2028xxx  channels.
we then used the kapp values from eq. 1 and the langmuir isotherm (hille, 1992) to predict the percentage of
available channels at a given cocaine concentration:
figure 5 use-dependent cocaine block of ␮1 and  xxxg2028xxx  channels. sixty
pulses to ⫹30 mv were delivered to ␮1 channels (a) and to  xxxg2028xxx  channels
(b) at stimulation frequencies of 1 and 2 hz. in control saline (filled
symbols in a and b), the pulse protocol did not elicit use-dependent
decreases in current amplitude at either 1 or 2 hz. the development of
use-dependent block in 30 ␮m cocaine was best fitted by a single exponential function. (a) use-dependent cocaine block of ␮1 channels developed with a time constant of 4.1 ⫾ 0.3 pulses and reached steady state at
39.4 ⫾ 1.8% block during 1 hz stimulation, and had a time constant of
4.9 ⫾ 0.2 pulses and reached steady state at 50.1 ⫾ 1.6% block during 2
hz stimulation. (b) use-dependent cocaine block of  xxxg2028xxx  channels developed with a time constant of 4.5 ⫾ 0.3 pulses and reached steady state at
41.5 ⫾ 1.7% block during 1 hz stimulation, and had a time constant of
5.4 ⫾ 0.3 pulses and reached steady state at 53.2 ⫾ 1.3% block during 2
hz stimulation.

the extremely slow nature of the recovery from block (fig.
4) and the extent of use-dependent block (fig. 5) at  xxxg2028xxx 
channels suggest that these two parameters, in conjunction
with the rhythmic cardiac action potential, may play significant roles in cocaine-induced cardiotoxicity.
simulation of cocaine block using a modulated
receptor model
in a previous report we attributed the differences in steadystate cocaine block between ␮1 and  xxxg2028xxx  to the differences
in their steady-state inactivation curves (wright et al.,
1997). the data in the present study appear to support our
claim because the v0.5 values of steady-state cocaine block
were better correlated with the v0.5 values of steady-state
inactivation than with the v0.5 values of activation. further-

where ina is the peak current measured during the test pulse
and [la] is the cocaine concentration.
we applied the simulation to ␮1 and  xxxg2028xxx  channels and
used the 30 ␮m and 300 ␮m cocaine data from wright et al.
(1997) to see how well the model fit the data. the solid lines
in figs. 6 b and c) are the results of the simulation using
eqs. 1 and 3, and the symbols are the percentages of
available channels in 30 ␮m cocaine (filled symbols) and in
300 ␮m cocaine (open symbols). the simulation predicted
steady-state cocaine block of ␮1 channels within a few
millivolts at the midpoint of block (fig. 6 b), whereas
steady-state cocaine block of  xxxg2028xxx  channels was several
millivolts more negative than predicted by the simulation
(fig. 6 c). scheme a in diagram 1 depicts the simplified
model (bean et al., 1983) that uses eqs. 1 and 3 to predict
cocaine block. thus, even though eq. 1 imposed a significant leftward shift on the kapp value, the simulation failed to
account for an equilibrium shift toward the inactivated and
blocked state. one of the defining characteristics of a modulated receptor (hille, 1977) is that local anesthetic shifts
the equilibrium from the resting and drug-bound state (r*)
toward the inactivated and drug-bound state (i*) as depicted
in scheme b. the difference between the amount of block
predicted by the initial simulation (scheme a) and the
actual amount of block may be indicative of an equilibrium
shift in the r* 7 i* portion of scheme b (courtney, 1975).
note that we could not directly measure this equilibrium

we also used the model to simulate 30 ␮m cocaine block
of the channel chimeras, ␮1-␤1 channels, and  xxxg2028xxx -␤1 channels (fig. 7). the solid lines in fig. 7, a–d show the
predicted results using eqs. 1 and 3 for 30 ␮m cocaine
block of ␮1(1–3) xxxg2028xxx (4), ␮1(1) xxxg2028xxx (2– 4), ␮1-␤1, and  xxxg2028xxx -␤1
channels. introducing equilibrium shifts of ⫺5 mv and ⫺6
mv, respectively, to the h⬁ curves of ␮1(1–3) xxxg2028xxx (4) and
␮1(1) xxxg2028xxx (2– 4) channels improved the prediction (fig. 7, a
and b, dotted lines). as with ␮1 and  xxxg2028xxx  channels, applying
equilibrium shifts of ⫺4.5 mv and ⫺10 mv to the h⬁
curves of ␮1-␤1 and  xxxg2028xxx -␤1 channels, respectively, improved the prediction by the model (fig. 7, c and d, dotted
lines). fig. 8 plots the average v0.5 values of cocaine block
versus the average v0.5 values of steady-state inactivation.
each symbol corresponds to the averaged data from one of
the isoforms in the study (see fig. 8 legend). the cross
symbol directly above each data point is the corresponding
v0.5 value of cocaine block as predicted by the simple
model (scheme a). the simulation results in figs. 6 – 8
show that the equilibrium shift was larger for  xxxg2028xxx  and
 xxxg2028xxx -␤1 channels than for any of the other channels, suggesting that a larger equilibrium shift from r* to i* at the
 xxxg2028xxx  isoform may be an important factor in cocaine-induced
cardiotoxicity (see discussion).

shift because channels in the r* and i* states do not conduct. to account for the additional equilibrium shift at the
drug-bound states and to improve the fit by the model, we
adjusted the h⬁ curves of ␮1 and  xxxg2028xxx  channels by trial and
error. adjusting the h⬁ curves of ␮1 and  xxxg2028xxx  channels by
⫺4.5 mv and ⫺10 mv, respectively, improved how well the
model predicted cocaine block (dotted lines in fig. 6, b and c).

in a previous paper (wright et al., 1997), we showed that
mammalian isoforms of cardiac and skeletal muscle sodium
channel had similar resting and inactivated affinities for
cocaine and lidocaine. this was in contrast to other studies
(nuss et al., 1995b; wang et al., 1996b) which suggested
that the sodium channels in cardiac tissue have a greater
affinity for lidocaine compared to other sodium channel
isoforms, and that this greater affinity might explain why
cardiac tissue is relatively more sensitive than skeletal muscle to certain local anesthetics. we suggested that the differences in steady-state inactivation between  xxxg2028xxx  channels
and ␮1 channels may in part explain the cardiotoxic effects
of cocaine.
in the present study we further addressed state-dependent
cocaine block of ␮1 and  xxxg2028xxx  sodium channels by focusing
on the mechanisms responsible for the greater cocaine block
of the  xxxg2028xxx  isoform at intermediate voltages. first, we used
shifts in the steady-state inactivation of ␮1 and  xxxg2028xxx  channels as a tool for investigating steady-state cocaine block.
we induced shifts in steady-state inactivation by creating
␮1/ xxxg2028xxx  channel chimeras and also by coexpressing the rat

the improved fits after imposing negative shifts in the h⬁ curves. the shifts for ␮1(1–3) xxxg2028xxx (4), ␮1(1) xxxg2028xxx (2– 4), ␮1-␤1, and  xxxg2028xxx -␤1 channels were ⫺5 mv,

brain ␤1 subunit with the ␣ subunits of ␮1 or  xxxg2028xxx . the
shifts in the midpoint voltage of steady-state inactivation
produced by these methods elicited directionally similar
shifts in the midpoint voltage of cocaine block. second,
unlike several previous studies conducted with other expression systems, ␤1 subunit coexpression with the ␮1 or  xxxg2028xxx 
␣ subunits in hek cells shifted the voltage dependence of
steady-state inactivation to more positive voltages, rather
than toward more negative voltages, and did not affect the
time constant of macroscopic current decay. in addition,
coexpression of the ␤1 subunit did not alter the cocaine
affinities of either resting or inactivated channels. and third,
we used the h⬁ curves, the kd values at resting and inactivated channels, and the langmuir isotherm to simulate
steady-state cocaine block.
effects of channel chimera structure and ␤1
subunit coexpression on channel kinetics
we found it interesting that channel activation for both
␮1(1–3) xxxg2028xxx (4) and ␮1(1) xxxg2028xxx (2– 4) resembled the activation

kinetics of ␮1 channels. because ␮1(1) xxxg2028xxx (2– 4) contains
only domain 1 from ␮1 channels, it would be tempting to
speculate that domain 1 is the crucial domain for determining channel activation. however, chahine et al. (1996) and
benzinger et al. (1997) have also shown that the activation
of several different ␮1/ xxxg2028xxx  channel chimeras each resembled the activation of ␮1. recently, mitrovic et al. (1998)
used cysteine point mutation within d2s4 and subsequent
treatment with a cysteine modifying agent to demonstrate
that domain 2 plays a significant role in channel activation.
the findings by mitrovic et al. (1998) and the data in fig.
1 b argue against the hypothesis (marcotte et al., 1997) that
activation begins by outward movement of the s4 segment
containing the most charged residues (domain 4) and concludes with the outward movement of the s4 segment with
the fewest charged residues (domain 1). if this type of
sequential movement of s4 segments occurred, then the
activation phenotype of ␮1(1) xxxg2028xxx (2– 4) should have resembled the activation of  xxxg2028xxx  channels rather than ␮1 channels.
these data suggest that channel activation is much more
complex than can be deduced from the number of charged

steady-state inactivation for the six channels in the study. as in fig. 3, the
solid line is the regression line through the plot of average v0.5 values of
cocaine block versus the average v0.5 values of steady-state inactivation. in
this figure, the individual channels are distinguished by a symbol (filled
square, ␮1; open square, ␮1-␤1; filled circle,  xxxg2028xxx ; open circle,  xxxg2028xxx -␤1;
open triangle, ␮1(1–3) xxxg2028xxx (4); and open diamond, ␮1(1) xxxg2028xxx (2– 4)). the
crosses are the predicted v0.5 values of cocaine block using eqs. 1 and 3
and the dotted line is the regression through the points. the cross symbol
located directly above each data point corresponds to the predicted
v0.5 value of cocaine block for that particular channel. as discussed in the
text, the predicted values for  xxxg2028xxx  channels and  xxxg2028xxx -␤1 channels had the
largest deviations from the measured data (filled circle and open circle,
respectively).

residues in the s4 segments. one possible explanation for
the discrepancy between our channel chimera data and the
apparent importance of domain 2 in activation (mitrovic et
al., 1998) may be that domain regions from the ␮1 isoform
dominate the activation phenotype of channel chimeras
constructed from ␮1 and  xxxg2028xxx .
the steady-state inactivation data obtained for ␮1,  xxxg2028xxx ,
and the channel chimeras indicate that the four domain
regions have an evenly distributed role in determining the
h⬁ phenotype (fig. 1 c). the v0.5 of steady-state inactivation for ␮1(1) xxxg2028xxx (2– 4) channels was ⬃4 mv less negative
than that of  xxxg2028xxx , and the v0.5 of inactivation for ␮1(1–3) xxxg2028xxx (4)
channels was ⬃4 mv more negative than that of ␮1. in
another chimera study (benzinger et al., 1997), the effects
of a single domain substitution on steady-state inactivation
phenotype seemed less clear because the v0.5 values of
steady-state inactivation for all chimeras were actually less
negative than that of ␮1. although we were unable to test
this phenomenon further using comparable channel chimeras ( xxxg2028xxx (1)␮1(2– 4) and  xxxg2028xxx (1–3)␮1(4)), the present data suggest that each domain contributes, perhaps equally, to the
steady-state inactivation phenotype.
the shifts in the voltage dependence of activation and/or
steady-state inactivation after coexpression of sodium channel ␣ subunits with the rat brain ␤1 subunit appear to vary
depending on the expression system and perhaps also on the
sodium channel isoform. coexpression of the ␤1 subunit
shifted the activation and inactivation kinetics of rat brain
sodium channels to more negative voltages in xenopus
oocytes (isom et al., 1992) and in chinese hamster cells
(isom et al., 1995). ␤1 subunit coexpression with ␮1 chan-

243

nels in oocytes also elicited a negative shift in the voltage
dependence of steady-state inactivation (nuss et al., 1995a).
in oocytes, the effect of ␤1 subunit coexpression with
cardiac sodium channels varies from no shift in the steadystate inactivation of  xxxg2028xxx  channels (nuss et al., 1995b) or rat
heart sodium channels (rh1; qu et al., 1995) to one report
of a modest but significant positive shift for  xxxg2028xxx  channels
(makielski et al., 1996). in contrast to these studies, we
found that coexpression of the ␤1 subunit with sodium
channel ␣ subunits in hek cells markedly shifted steadystate inactivation (fig. 2 c) of ␮1 and  xxxg2028xxx  channels in the
positive direction by ⬃10 mv and ⬃13 mv, respectively.
we cannot presently explain the variable effects of ␤1
subunit coexpression on sodium channel kinetics. one possibility may be that cellular processes such as protein phosphorylation (see cukierman, 1996 for review), which can
affect channel kinetics, differ among different expression
systems. alternatively, the time-dependent negative shift in
steady-state inactivation (wang et al., 1996a) may be reduced or eliminated by ␤1 subunit coexpression.
the positive voltage shifts in steady-state inactivation
produced by ␤1 subunit coexpression with ␮1 and  xxxg2028xxx 
resulted in directionally similar shifts in cocaine block (fig.
2 d). the average v0.5 values of cocaine block for ␮1-␤1
and  xxxg2028xxx -␤1 were 12.3 mv and 15.0 mv, respectively, more
positive than the v0.5 values of cocaine block for the ␣
subunits of ␮1 and  xxxg2028xxx . also important, ␤1 subunit coexpression did not affect the cocaine affinities of either resting
or inactivated channels. in contrast, ␤1 subunit coexpression with  xxxg2028xxx  channels in the oocyte expression system
decreased the affinity of resting channels for lidocaine by
⬃2-fold (makielski et al., 1996); a result most likely due to
a small (3–7 mv) positive shift in steady-state inactivation.

steady-state cocaine block, the modulated
receptor model, and cocaine-induced
cardiotoxicity
the data in figs. 1–3 indicated that shifts in the voltage
dependence of steady-state inactivation induced linear shifts
in the voltage dependence of steady-state cocaine block.
the simple model (scheme a in diagram 1; bean et al.,
1983), which used the h⬁ curve and the kd values at resting
and inactivated channels, gave a fairly accurate prediction
of steady-state cocaine block at ␮1 channels (v0.5 within
⬃5 mv), but gave a somewhat less accurate prediction at
 xxxg2028xxx  channels (v0.5 within ⬃10 mv). even though the v0.5
values of cocaine block were shifted by ⬃⫺10 mv compared to the v0.5 values of steady-state inactivation, the
simple model failed to account for the entire equilibrium
shift because it did not include the transitions between the
r* and i* states (scheme b). thus, the difference between
␮1 and  xxxg2028xxx  channels in the size of the underestimated
equilibrium shift may reflect the difference in the amount of
cocaine-induced leftward shift in h⬁, which in our case
becomes evident in the v0.5 value of steady-state cocaine

block. for example, the v0.5 values of steady-state inactivation at ␮1 and  xxxg2028xxx -␤1 channels were similar at ⫺79 mv
and ⫺81 mv, respectively, but the v0.5 value of cocaine
block was ⬃8 mv more negative for  xxxg2028xxx -␤1 channels than
for ␮1 channels. indeed, these data suggest that the 15 mv
difference between the v0.5 values of steady-state inactivation at ␮1 and  xxxg2028xxx  (wright et al., 1997), as well as a larger
cocaine-induced shift in the h⬁ curve of  xxxg2028xxx  channels
contribute to cocaine-induced cardiotoxicity.
although steady-state inactivation appears to play the
major role in determining steady-state cocaine block, channel activation could be one of the factors responsible for the
magnitude of the underestimation in h⬁ shift. compare the
v0.5 value of steady-state inactivation to the v0.5 value of
cocaine block for each channel (table 1), and note the
interesting quantitative difference between ␮1 and  xxxg2028xxx . for
␮1 channels the difference between the v0.5 value of cocaine block and the v0.5 value of steady-state inactivation
was ⬃14 mv and for  xxxg2028xxx  channels the difference was ⬃19
mv. these differences were essentially the same at ␮1-␤1
and  xxxg2028xxx -␤1 channels. for both of the channel chimeras, the
difference between the v0.5 value of steady-state cocaine
block and the v0.5 value of steady-state inactivation was
⬃15 mv. when we adjusted the h⬁ curves to improve the fit
by the simple model, the shift in the h⬁ curve that best
improved the fit to the cocaine data from ␮1 and ␮1-␤1
channels was ⫺4.5 mv, whereas the adjustment for  xxxg2028xxx 
and  xxxg2028xxx -␤1 channels was ⫺10 mv. for ␮1(1) xxxg2028xxx (2– 4) and
␮1(1–3) xxxg2028xxx (4), the adjustments were 5 and 6 mv, respectively, which more closely resembled the adjustment required for ␮1 channels. the fact that ␮1 channels and the
channel chimeras had the same activation phenotype and
required similar adjustments in h⬁ to improve the fit by the
simple model suggests that channel activation may affect
the magnitude of the underestimated shift. as the conditioning voltage becomes less negative,  xxxg2028xxx  channels enter
preopen or preactivated states, which may influence the
equilibrium shift from r* to i*. however, at the ␮1 isoform
and at the chimeras, channel activation begins at voltages
⬃15 mv more positive than at the  xxxg2028xxx  isoform, so these
channels would therefore not enter the preactivated states at
the same voltages. this possible role for activation in the
equilibrium shift of the h⬁ curve is consistent with previous
suggestions that activation is important in local anesthetic
action (starmer et al., 1984; yeh and tanguy, 1985).
the notion that state-dependent differences between cardiac and skeletal muscle sodium channels influence local
anesthetic action in cardiac tissue has been previously reported for single batrachotoxin-modified sodium channels
(zamponi et al., 1993; zamponi and french, 1993). in
native channels, the antiarrhythmic properties of lidocaine
and the cardiotoxic properties of cocaine most likely result
from steady-state interactions with inactivated sodium channels at the diastolic membrane potential, as well as from
use-dependent interactions with activated and inactivated
channels during the cardiac action potential. here, we
present an additional mechanism wherein cocaine induces a

volume 76

larger shift in the h⬁ curve at cardiac sodium channels than
at skeletal muscle sodium channels. this additional shift in
h⬁ may arise from the coupling between channel activation
and inactivation (o’leary et al., 1995), both of which proceed at significantly more negative potentials in the cardiac
isoform.
