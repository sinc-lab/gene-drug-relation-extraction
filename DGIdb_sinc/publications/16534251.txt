abstract
the present study was performed to evaluate the role of
 xxxd2738xxx  in the intraocular pressure (iop) lowering effect and in the miotic action of morphine. the iop was
measured in conscious, normal, dark-adapted new zealand white rabbits using a calibrated pneumatonometer.
experiments were conducted, in which rabbits’ eyes
were treated with morphine topically and unilaterally,
while the fellow eyes received vehicle. iop and pupil diameter (pd) measurements were taken 0.5 and 0 h before
morphine administration and 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 h thereafter. the effects of a nonselective opioid receptor antagonist (naloxone), a  xxxd2738xxx  synthase inhibitor
(n-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester; l-name), and a sulfhydryl reagent (reduced  xxxd2213xxx ; gsh) on morphine-mediated changes in iop and pd were also determined. morphine (10, 33, and 100 g) produced concentration-dependent decreases in iop and reduced pd in
both treated and untreated eyes of new zealand white
rabbits. iop-lowering effect of morphine (100 g) and
reduction in pd were both significantly inhibited by pretreatment with naloxone (100 g), l-name (0.5%), or
gsh (100 g). the results from this study indicate that

pd are opioid-receptor-mediated responses that are associated with the release of  xxxd2738xxx . because the 3
opioid receptor subtype has a  xxxd2738xxx -releasing activity and is sensitive to inactivation by gsh, it is concluded that morphine-induced ocular hypotension and
miosis are mediated, in part, by activation of 3 opioid
receptors.

introduction

morphine-induced ocular hypotension and miosis
have been reported previously, but the exact mechanism(s) involved in these effects have not been completely clariﬁed. originally, morphine was reported to
raise the intraocular pressure (iop) [1], but subsequent
studies and reports demonstrated its ability to lower the
iop [2–4]. the ocular effects of morphine (particularly
the miotic effect) are generally accepted to occur primarily through centrally mediated signaling mechanisms [5,
6]. to date, however, a direct or indirect intraocular
component has not been ruled out. various endogenous
opioid peptides, as well as their receptors, have been
identiﬁed in the eyes of humans [4, 7] and rabbits [8].
opioid-containing (enkephalinergic) neurons and opioid peptides (enkephalins and dynorphins) have also
been reported in iris-ciliary body, choroid membranes,
cornea, and lacrimal glands of various species [9].

materials and methods
animals
normal, dark-adapted (reverse light cycle, 12 h dark/12 h light)
new zealand white (nzw) rabbits, weighing 2–4 kg, were used in
this study. each animal was used as its own control, and there was
a 1-week washout and recovery period between drug treatments.
all measurements were done in the dark under a constant red light,
as it was demonstrated [15–18] that rabbits have higher iop values
in the dark than in the light. all animals were housed individually
at room temperature and were maintained on purina rabbit chow

and tap water ad libitum. animal care and treatment were in accordance with the arvo (association for research in vision and
ophthalmology) resolution on the use of animals in research,
and the institutional care and use committee of the morehouse
school of medicine, atlanta, ga., usa, reviewed and approved
protocols. all drugs were obtained from sigma chemical (st. louis, mo., usa).
measurements of iop and pd
the iop (mm hg) was measured with the use of a manometrically calibrated pneumatonometer (mentor, norwell, mass., usa).
this instrument was calibrated before and after each measurement
with the mentor calibration veriﬁer. tetracaine hydrochloride
(25 l, 0.05% in nanopure water) was applied topically to corneas
prior to each iop measurement to minimize discomfort. because
each animal served as its own control, and there was no signiﬁcant
variation in the control readings, an effect due to tetracaine could
be ruled out. measurements of the iop were taken 0.5 and 0 h before morphine administration and 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 h thereafter.
pds were recorded at the same time points as iop measurements,
under constant illumination with red light, using a ciba vision
(duluth, ga., usa) millimeter rule.
drug administration
three doses (10, 33, and 100 g/25-l volume of saline) of morphine were applied topically and unilaterally in three separate
masked iop experiments, in which the person involved in drug
administration and measurements had no knowledge of the solution’s contents. the contralateral eye received an equal volume
(25 l) of vehicle. in other experiments, the nonselective opioid
receptor antagonist naloxone (100 g), the nonselective nos inhibitor l-name (0.5%), or gsh (100 g) were administered bilaterally to rabbits 0.5 h before morphine (100 g) administration.
statistics
data were analyzed for differences using one-way analysis of
variance, followed by the holm-sidak method for multiple comparisons. results are expressed as mean values 8 sem obtained
from 8 control or 4 drug-treated rabbits and were considered signiﬁcant when p ! 0.05.

results

effect of morphine on the iop in normal
dark-adapted nzw rabbits
morphine applied topically and unilaterally caused a
dose-dependent reduction of the iop in both the treated
and untreated eyes (ﬁg. 1). in the ipsilateral eye, a statistically signiﬁcant decline in the iop occurred 0.5 h after
administration of the 100-g doses and 1 h after treatment with the 10- and 33-g doses. the effect of morphine (100 g) was delayed in the contralateral eye. the
maximum reduction in iop occurred 1 and 2 h after drug
treatment in the ipsilateral or contralateral eyes, respectively.

lord et al. [10] provided the ﬁrst documented evidence that exogenous morphine could bind to receptors
in the mammalian brain. this evidence demonstrated
that morphine binds to the same sites as those used by
the endogenous opioid peptides. activation of these opioid receptors in the brain has been shown to have effects
on iop [4] and iris function [5, 7] in man. since then,
demonstration of the multiplicity of receptor types has
led to the understanding that, depending on their site of
action, opioid peptides, as well as opiate alkaloids such
as morphine, might bind to more than one opiate receptor subtype. by comparing afﬁnity constants as well as
relative potency in competitive binding assays, various
ligands have been found to have different degrees of selectivity. pasternak [11] reported both high- and lowafﬁnity binding sites for [3h] xxxd1888xxx  and
[3h]naloxone in the rat brain. the higher-afﬁnity type
was designated 1 and the lower-afﬁnity morphine-selective type was designated 2 [12, 13].
at present, the  opioid receptor has three recognized
subtypes, 1, 2, and the most recently ascribed 3. the
3 subtype is an opiate alkaloid selective receptor that is
insensitive to opioid peptides. the insensitivity of the 3
receptor to opioid peptides is correlated with its coupling
to constitutive  xxxd2738xxx  (no) synthase ( xxxg1577xxx   xxxg1579xxx ) derived no release [14]. this morphine-induced no release is naloxone sensitive and is antagonized by the nos
inhibitors n-nitro-l-arginine and n-nitro-l-arginine
methyl ester (l-name). furthermore, the 3 receptor
appears to be more sensitive to inactivation by reduced
glutathione (gsh) than are classical , , and  receptors.
the present in vivo studies were designed to give evidence of a role of no in morphine-mediated reduction
of iop and pupil diameter (pd). with the use of an inhibitor of no synthesis and gsh, functional evidence
that morphine-induced ocular hypotension and miosis
are linked to the activation of 3 opioid receptors has also
been established.

in order to conﬁrm that the effect of morphine on iop
was opioid receptor mediated, the nonselective opioid
receptor antagonist naloxone was utilized. pretreatment
with naloxone (100 g) caused a signiﬁcant reduction of,
but did not completely abolish, the iop-lowering effect
of morphine (100 g; ﬁg. 2). in the ipsilateral eye, naloxone alone caused minimal changes in iop over the 5-hour
course of the experiment. however, in the untreated eyes,
naloxone did produce a signiﬁcant reduction of the iop
at the earlier time points (0.5–2 h).

in order to generate evidence that the morphine-induced reduction of the iop is associated with activation
of receptors linked to no release, experiments using the
nonselective nos inhibitor l-name and the sulfhydryl
compound gsh were performed. in the presence of lname (0.5%; ﬁg. 3) or gsh (100 g; ﬁg. 4), the morphine-induced reduction of the iop was partially reversed
in both the ipsilateral and contralateral eyes. in the treated eyes, when administered alone, both l-name and
gsh caused small but statistically signiﬁcant reductions

no is an important biomolecule responsible for many
biological activities. it is widely believed that the biological effects of no donors, such as nitrovasodilators, are

due to the release of no which activates soluble  xxxg1587xxx  [19]. the biological functions of no are so
diverse that it has been described as a second messenger,
neurotransmitter, as well as an autocrine, paracrine, hormonal [20], cytoprotective [21], and cytotoxic [22] agent.
the role of no has been studied extensively in many tissues, including the eye [23].
the present study has provided, for the ﬁrst time, evidence of the role of no in the ocular hypotensive and
miotic effects of morphine. morphine is known to mediate its effects through activation of  opioid receptors
[24]. of the three currently recognized  opioid receptor
subtypes (1, 2, and 3), the 3 subtype is the only one
which is known to be opiate alkaloid selective and coupled
to nos-derived no release [25]. in addition, the 3 receptor appears to be much more sensitive to inactivation
by gsh than other , , and  opioid receptors [26].
because morphine’s effects on other biological systems
have been consistently linked to no release and signaling
[27–29], the present study was designed to determine

in tables 3 and 4. in the ipsilateral eye, naloxone and gsh
produced complete inhibition of the miosis induced by
morphine (100 g). the inhibition generated by both
agents lasted throughout the course of the experiment.
the inhibitory effect of l-name in the drug-treated eyes
developed 0.5 h after morphine addition, but was diminished by hour 3 of the experiment. in the contralateral
eye, the miotic response to morphine (100 g) was completely inhibited throughout the course of the experiment, when the animals were pretreated with naloxone
(100 g), l-name (0.5%), or gsh (100 g). naloxone,
l-name, or gsh produced no signiﬁcant changes in pd
when administered alone (data not shown).

shown in ﬁgure 2 and in tables 3 and 4, respectively, thus,
indicating that the responses are opioid receptor mediated.
studies that have reported on the role of no in the
regulation of aqueous humor outﬂow and iop have generated conﬂicting data. some studies have shown that
both topical and intraocular administration of no donors reduced iop [30–32], while others reported that topical no donors increased the iop without affecting aqueous humor formation [33] or outﬂow facility [34]. yet,
other studies have shown that no donors have no effect
on the iop in rabbits [35] or humans [36].

whether no plays a role in morphine-mediated changes
in ocular hydrodynamics and iris function. in the present
study, morphine produced a dose-dependent bilateral reduction in iop in nzw rabbits. this bilateral ocular hypotensive effect of morphine suggests that the action may
involve activity on  opioid receptors located centrally
and peripherally. the lowering of the iop was of similar
magnitude in both treated and contralateral eyes, thus
indicating some potential for central activity. although
the miotic effect of morphine was bilateral, it was not dose
dependent. the sensitivity of the morphine-induced reductions of iop and pd to naloxone pretreatment is

in the present study, l-name effectively reduced but
did not completely inhibit the morphine-induced reduction of iop, indicating a signiﬁcant role of no in the
response. surprisingly, l-name, when administered
alone, produced a small but signiﬁcant decrease in the
iop in both ipsilateral and contralateral eyes. because it
has been demonstrated in this study that morphine reduces the iop, in part, through the release of no, it seems
logical that inhibiting the synthesis of no with l-name
would either have no effect or raise the iop. however,
the results obtained with l-name in the present study
help to demonstrate the complexity of no signaling in
the regulation of aqueous humor dynamics. other studies
have highlighted the signiﬁcance of no on aqueous humor formation by the fact that l-name reduced the
aqueous humor formation in anesthetized rabbits, an effect that would lead to a reduction of the iop [37]. however, it was postulated that this reduction in aqueous humor formation was due to ciliary vasoconstriction. to
complicate matters further, it was later reported [38] that
isosorbide-5-mononitrate, a no donor, did not reduce
the aqueous humor ﬂow in healthy human volunteers.
l-name produced variable degrees of inhibition of
morphine-stimulated reductions in iop and pd. whereas only a partial reversal of morphine-induced reduction
of the iop was generated in the presence of l-name,
complete inhibition of morphine-induced miosis was
seen with l-name pretreatment in the contralateral eye.
in the ipsilateral eye, the effect of l-name on morphineinduced miosis occurred 0.5 h after morphine treatment,
but ended by the 3rd h of the experiment, thus suggesting
that the morphine-mediated reduction of pd at the later
time points in the drug-treated eye occurs through nonno-related signaling mechanisms.
in this study, the sulfhydryl reagent, gsh, was used to
generate further evidence that morphine-mediated changes in iop and pd are occurring, at least in part, through

activation of 3 receptors. gsh alone caused no signiﬁcant change in pd at any time during the course of the
experiment. the iop in both eyes, on the other hand, was
signiﬁcantly reduced by gsh at the 0.5-, 1-, 2-, and 3hour time points, suggesting that 3 receptors may play
a role in maintaining the iop under basal conditions.
gsh partially inhibited the reduction of iop by morphine, beginning 0.5 h after administration of morphine.
in the ipsilateral eye, the effect of gsh on morphine-induced ocular hypotension lasted for approximately 3.5 h.
in the contralateral eye, the inhibitory effect of gsh was
not evident until hour 2 of the experiment, but the inhibition lasted thereafter to the end of the experiment. in
the presence of gsh, the morphine-induced miosis was
completely blocked, starting at 0.5 h and lasting throughout the course of the experiment in both treated and untreated eyes. the effect of gsh thereby provides further
conﬁrmation of the involvement of no in morphine-mediated changes in iop and pd.
in summary, this study provides the ﬁrst evidence of
a role of no in the ocular hypotensive and miotic effects of morphine. the sensitivity of both responses to
inhibition of the nos activity and the presence of gsh
has helped to establish that these effects are mediated,
in part, by activation of the 3 subtype of the  opioid
receptor. future studies will be designed to determine
the site of action of morphine-mediated changes in ocular hydrodynamics and iris function, as well as the
speciﬁc subtype of nos that is involved in these responses.
