abstract
since the initial characterization of  xxxg2296xxx  alpha ( xxxg2296xxx ), it has become clear that  xxxg2296xxx 
has diverse biologic activity. the realization that  xxxg2296xxx  plays a role in rheumatoid arthritis (ra) has led
to the development of anti-tnf agents for the treatment of ra. infliximab, a chimeric monoclonal
antibody that specifically, and with high affinity, binds to  xxxg2296xxx  and neutralizes the cytokine, is currently
approved for the treatment of ra and crohn’s disease, another immune-inflammatory disorder. in
addition to establishing the safety and efficacy of infliximab, clinical research has also provided insights
into the complex cellular and cytokine-dependent pathways involved in the pathophysiology of ra,
including evidence that supports  xxxg2296xxx  involvement in cytokine regulation, cell recruitment,
angiogenesis, and tissue destruction.

introduction
 xxxg2296xxx  alpha ( xxxg2296xxx ) is the name given to a
serum factor that was derived in 1975 from endotoxintreated mice and found to be capable of inducing necrosis
of a methylcholanthrene-induced murine sarcoma [1]. the
molecular characterization of  xxxg2296xxx  in the 1980s revealed
that it is identical to  xxxg2296xxx , a previously described
serum factor that was found to be responsible for weight
loss and fever in experimental animal models [2,3]. the
diverse biologic activities of  xxxg2296xxx  soon became apparent.
aside from its tumoricidal property, it was recognized that,
following injection into animals or humans,  xxxg2296xxx  causes
signs and symptoms of shock, including multi-organ
damage via pro-inflammatory effects on vascular endothelium. the realization that  xxxg2296xxx  may play a role in rheumatoid arthritis (ra) followed four demonstrations: firstly,
its ability to degrade cartilage and bone in vitro; secondly,
its arthritogenic properties in animal models; thirdly, its

s22

co-localization with tnf receptors in ra synovium and the
pannus-cartilage junction; and fourthly, its pivotal role in
regulating the production of interleukin (il)-1 in cultured
ra-derived synovial cells (a mixture of lymphoid cells,
macrophages, dendritic cells, b cells, endothelial cells,
and fibroblasts) [4,5].
support for the role of  xxxg2296xxx  in ra, and hence its promise
as a therapeutic target candidate, came from the observation that the clinical signs and tissue damage of collageninduced arthritis in mice were ameliorated by
administration of a monoclonal anti- xxxg2296xxx  antibody [6]. in
1992, 20 patients with active ra despite treatment with
disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs were the first to be
treated with an anti- xxxg2296xxx  agent, infliximab (remicade®,
centocor, inc, malvern, pa). in this open-label clinical trial
by our group at the kennedy institute of rheumatology
division, the safety and marked anti-inflammatory effect of

attract = anti- xxxg2296xxx  trial in rheumatoid arthritis with concomitant therapy; crp =  xxxg520xxx ; il = interleukin; mtx =
methotrexate; ra = rheumatoid arthritis;  xxxg2296xxx  =  xxxg2296xxx  alpha; vegf =  xxxg2413xxx .

intravenously administered infliximab was associated with
a dramatic reduction in  xxxg520xxx  (crp) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate [7]. a multicenter, randomized,
placebo-controlled trial in europe quickly followed and
confirmed the anti-inflammatory effect of a single intravenous infusion of infliximab [8]. however, most patients
relapsed within 3 to 8 weeks demonstrating the requirement for repeat therapy [9]. the duration of benefit before
relapse was related to the size of the drug dose (1 or
10 mg/kg).
the efficacy and optimal dose of infliximab, as well as an
enhanced therapeutic efficacy when coadministered with
methotrexate (mtx), was subsequently established in a
follow-up, randomized, controlled clinical trial [10,11]. the
consistency of a sustained therapeutic clinical response in
long-term treatment (2 years) with infliximab plus mtx
under double-blinded, placebo-controlled conditions has
now been demonstrated in the international, multicenter
anti- xxxg2296xxx  trial in rheumatoid arthritis
with concomitant therapy (attract) [12–14]. patients
were randomized to receive either four dose schedules of
infliximab plus weekly doses of mtx (median dose
15 mg/wk) or mtx alone. serial radiographs performed at
24, 54, and 102 weeks of this trial have revealed retardation or arrest (and even improvement in 39% to 54% of
patients) of both joint space narrowing (which equates
with cartilage loss) and bone erosion. these results are in
contrast to the progressive damage in the control group of
patients who were treated with mtx alone [12,14]. these
data are consistent with the hypothesis that  xxxg2296xxx  plays a
key role in the perpetuation of inflammation and destruction of cartilage and bone in ra.

pharmacokinetics and clinical response

therapeutic response to infliximab correlates with the
pharmacokinetics of infliximab and basal expression of
 xxxg2296xxx  in synovial tissue. measurements of infliximab blood
levels and  xxxg2296xxx  expression in joints suggest that  xxxg2296xxx 
blockade at the site of production — mainly by cells of the
macrophage lineage in the joint — is the key to its mode of
action. there are close relationships between the dose of
infliximab administered, infliximab blood concentrations,
the durability of the clinical response, and eventual return
of all clinical features following its clearance from blood
[10,11]. infliximab given repeatedly at a dose of 1 mg/kg
was associated with a rapid loss of therapeutic response
and accelerated clearance from the blood [10]. however,
this study also demonstrated the synergy of infliximab
when combined with mtx (figure 1) [10], which is in part
explained by a lowered incidence of anti-infliximab antibodies observed with combination therapy. these data
indicate that the antibody affects the effector mechanisms
and apparently does not terminate the more proximal
events that drive the disease process. as approximately
60% to 70% of patients show an initial response to infliximab, it seems likely that, in a subset of the nonresponder
population (defined by the acr response),  xxxg2296xxx  is not
the key pivotal molecule regulating the cytokine network at
that point of the disease course. however, a clear clinical
and radiographic response has been noted in patients
who do not demonstrate a response as measured by acr
20 criteria. this conclusion is supported by the documentation of a correlation between a good clinical response to
infliximab only when, prior to treatment, there is a significant level of expression of  xxxg2296xxx  in synovial biopsies [18].
infliximab regulates the cytokine network

infliximab
infliximab, a chimeric (mouse fv1, human igg1) monoclonal antibody, specifically binds to both soluble and
membrane-bound  xxxg2296xxx  with high affinity (ka = 1010 m–1),
forming stable nondisassociating immune complexes [15].
the binding of infliximab to  xxxg2296xxx  prevents the binding of
 xxxg2296xxx  to its receptors and blocks the initiation of the intracellular signaling that leads to gene transcription and subsequent biologic activity. the binding of infliximab to
membrane-bound  xxxg2296xxx  in vitro results in lysis of cell lines
via a complement- or antibody-dependent cell cytotoxicity
mechanism [16,17]. whether this in vitro action has an in
vivo correlate has not been confirmed. the similarity of
clinical results observed for infliximab and etanercept,
another anti-tnf agent, suggests that cell lysis may not be
a necessary prerequisite, as etanercept does not exhibit
similar cell lytic properties in vitro.
treatment of ra patients with infliximab has provided an
opportunity for clinical investigations that have illuminated
aspects of its cellular and molecular bases of action and
have provided insights into the pathogenesis of ra.

it was noted in our first trial that, following the administration of infliximab, simultaneous reductions in crp and il-6
concentrations were observed in the blood [7]. this correlation was clearly demonstrated in a subsequent study, as
was the rapid (within a few hours) reduction in serum il-6
concentrations in infliximab-treated patients, but not in
patients receiving placebo (figure 2) [19]. as crp production by hepatocytes is predominantly regulated by il-6,
the data are consistent with the conclusion that downregulation of il-6 production in ra joints was a consequence
of  xxxg2296xxx  blockade. the dominant role of  xxxg2296xxx  in the regulation of il-6 in ra demonstrated in vivo was entirely consistent with the data obtained on the reduction of il-6
production following the addition of anti- xxxg2296xxx  antibody to
ra synovial membrane cell cultures in vitro [20]. the
reduction of il-1 synthesis in synovial tissue by an antitnfalpha antibody in vitro was the pivotal observation that led
investigators to suspect the involvement of a cytokine
cascade in ra [21]; however, it has been more difficult to
verify these observations in vivo.

therapy revealed a reduction in, and linkage between,
 xxxg2296xxx  and il-1 synthesis [18]. serologic analysis of
extremely low levels of il-1 with different assays has
provided conflicting results, with significant reductions
observed in one laboratory and no consistent trend in
another laboratory [19,22].

s24

following infliximab therapy, a reduction in serum concentration of  xxxg1172xxx  ( xxxd2806xxx ) and soluble tnf
receptors has also provided evidence that two major anticytokines are regulated by  xxxg2296xxx  (figure 3) [19]. the
simultaneous reduction in pro-inflammatory and antiinflammatory molecules provides an interesting example of
the dominance of  xxxg2296xxx  in the cytokine network and a possible explanation for why anti- xxxg2296xxx  therapy does not
restore a long-lasting remission but instead perpetuates
the cytokine imbalance, and hence there is relapse of
disease upon withdrawal of therapy.

infliximab regulates cell recruitment

the marked reduction in the swelling and tenderness of
joints following infliximab treatment was shown in an early
study to be associated with a reduction in the cellularity of
the synovium of ra patients [23]. in a detailed immunohistologic analysis of serial biopsies before and after infliximab, it was observed that a reduction in cd3+ and
cd68+ cells was accompanied by a reduction in the adhesion molecules vascular cell adhesion molecule-1, intercellular adhesion molecule-1, and  xxxg2048xxx  [24]. soluble
 xxxg2048xxx  and soluble intercellular adhesion molecule-1
concentrations in blood were similarly reduced by infliximab, but not by placebo, and this reduction was closely
correlated with an increase in circulating lymphocytes [25].
in further studies, it was found that the expression of the
chemokines il-8 and monocyte chemotactic protein-1 was
also reduced in synovial biopsies within two weeks following infliximab therapy (figure 4) [24,26,27]. these data

direct evidence of a reduction in leukocyte recruitment in
joints was obtained by gamma-camera imaging of
111indium-labelled autologous polymorphonuclear cells in
the hands and knees of ra patients before and after infliximab therapy (figure 5) [26]. because inflammatory
disease is dependent on the influx of leukocytes, it is likely
that this reduction in leukocyte trafficking is an important
aspect of the mechanism of action of infliximab.

provided the evidence that anti- xxxg2296xxx  therapy regulates the
expression of adhesion molecules and chemokines on
rheumatoid vasculature. this led to the hypothesis that
reversing the migration of circulating leukocytes into
inflamed ra joints, and reversing their retention there,
might be an important mechanism of action.

from the early stages of disease, rheumatoid synovial
inflammation is accompanied by a marked increase in
angiogenesis. the increase in blood vessel density provides a conduit for the increased trafficking of blood-borne
immune and inflammatory cells into joints. this increase in
trafficking leads to the formation of vascular pannus tissue
that invades and destroys cartilage and bone in the “bare
area” of the attachment of synovium to subchondral bone.
the cytokine  xxxg2413xxx  (vegf) is
implicated in new blood vessel formation and is increased
in the joints and blood of ra patients [25,28,29]. infliximab therapy reduces circulating vegf levels and the
density of neovasculature in the synovium [25,30]
(figure 6). there is direct evidence of a reduction in the
number of blood vessels in infliximab-treated patients. a
reduction in angiogenesis may be relevant to our understanding of the anti-inflammatory and antidestructive properties of infliximab. in addition, although unproven, the
exudative leakage of plasma mediated by vegf may also
be ameliorated by infliximab.

infliximab prevents cartilage catabolism and bone erosion

s26

the most compelling evidence for the ability of anti- xxxg2296xxx 
therapy to prevent cartilage loss and bone erosions following the onset of disease was obtained by histologic
examination of joints in the collagen-induced arthritis
mouse model of ra [6]. in this model, preservation of
chondrocytes and cartilage matrix and the lack of pannus
invasion of bone were notable features in response to
treatment with infliximab. in ra patients in the attract
trial, protection of cartilage and bone was observed —
possibly with healing — as judged by comparison of baseline and 54-week radiographs of hands and feet in
patients treated with infliximab [12,25]. this finding supports the conclusion that mechanisms of tissue destruction in ra are  xxxg2296xxx -dependent. whether the
coadministration of mtx with infliximab plays a part in the
mechanism of action needs to be clarified. because etan-

ercept as monotherapy significantly slowed progression
of bone erosions in early ra patients over one year compared with mtx monotherapy, the bone-protective action
of anti- xxxg2296xxx  therapy is not in doubt [31]. a reduction in
 xxxg1418xxx  and  xxxg1437xxx 
following infliximab treatment has been documented, and
although the cellular and molecular basis of anti- xxxg2296xxx  in
this regard is not yet understood, this implies that a
downregulation of matrix-degrading enzymes may be
involved [32].
in animal models, il-1 appears to play a critical role in cartilage destruction; it has been proposed that il-1 may be a
better therapeutic target in ra and that the joint protective
effect of anti- xxxg2296xxx  therapy involves regulation of il-1 production [33,34]. the activation and function of osteoclasts
appear to involve not only il-1 and  xxxg2296xxx , but also the

infliximab therapy for ra has illuminated the multiple pathways regulated by  xxxg2296xxx  and its mechanism of action.
these studies have begun to unravel the complex cellular
and cytokine-dependent pathways that are involved and
have provided a new therapeutic benchmark. the lessons
we have learned will help to identify future research in
developing the next generation of antirheumatic drugs with
an improved efficacy and safety profile.
