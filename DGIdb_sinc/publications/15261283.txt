abstract—six active compounds, among previously synthesized and screened arylpiperazines, were selected and evaluated for the
binding aﬃnity to rat dopamine, serotonin and a1 receptors. two compounds with benztriazole group had a 5-ht2a /d2 binding
ratio characteristic for atypical neuroleptics (>1, pki values). compound 2, 5-{2-[4-(2,3-dimethyl-phenyl)- xxxd2960xxx -1-yl]ethyl}1hbenzotriazole, expressed clozapine-like in vitro binding proﬁle at d2 , 5-ht2a and a1 receptors and a higher aﬃnity for 5-ht1a
receptors than clozapine. also, it exhibited the noncataleptic behavioural pattern of atypical antipsychotics and antagonized
d-amphetamine-induced hyperlocomotion in rats.

1. introduction
one of the greatest challenges of modern psychopharmacology is a search for new antipsychotic drugs
(apds, i.e., neuroleptics) that would express a higher
therapeutic eﬃciency and a wider spectrum of action on
schizophrenia symptoms, with minimized adverse side
eﬀects. conventional apds, acting by a common
mechanism of central dopamine (da)  xxxg656xxx 
blockade, are generally considered to be eﬀective in the
treatment of schizophrenics with positive symptoms,1
while a diversiﬁed group of the so-called atypical apds
expresses increased eﬀectiveness in negative, aﬀective
and cognitive symptoms, including eﬃcacy in patients
resistant to standard therapy.2 atypical apds also have
a low incidence of extrapyramidal side eﬀects and prolactinaemia, but may produce other undesirable side
eﬀects (e.g., agranulocytosis) that limit their clinical
use.2 the mechanism of their action is still controversial,
since there are several models explaining ‘atypicality’ by
speciﬁc drug action on the subclasses of serotonergic (5-

ht), glutamatergic, muscarinic, or a-adrenergic receptors, by prevalent interaction with da d1 , d3 or d4
receptors, or by loose binding concept and faster drug
dissociation from the d2 receptors.2–4 a ‘dopamine–
serotonin hypothesis’ of schizophrenia proposed that
the essential dysregulation of 5-ht2a -/d2 -mediated
neurotransmission may be involved in development of
this disease.2;4 it was hypothesized that antagonism of
d2 and 5-ht2a receptors and enhancement of da and
5-ht release are critical elements in the action of
atypical apds, which could minimize both positive and
negative symptoms without producing signiﬁcant side
eﬀects.4–6 this model suggests the ratio of 5-ht2a to d2
receptor aﬃnities to be the major determinant of a
drug’s possibility to behave as an atypical antipsychotic.5 besides the accentuated role of the 5-ht2a
receptors in the aetiology of schizophrenia, an important contribution of other speciﬁc 5-ht receptors,
especially 5-ht1a , and 5-ht2c subclasses, but also of 5ht3 ,  xxxg1119xxx  and 5-ht7 receptors, is indicated in the
literature.4;6–8 research data showed that 5-ht1a agonism could be connected to the anticataleptic eﬀect of
apds and improvement of negative schizophrenia
symptoms.4;6–9 the new generation of therapeutically
successful atypical apds that act as a da-5-ht system
stabilizers with a partial agonist activity at the 5-ht1a
receptors, strong 5-ht2a antagonism and weak d2

promotes such a pattern of interaction for some newly
synthesized da/5-ht ligands that apply for atypical

cerning their anticipated role in the action of atypical
apds.3–8 speciﬁc binding aﬃnities (pki values, table 1)
of the new arylpiperazines and clozapine, a prototype of
atypical apd, were determined by measuring the extent
of displacement of 3 h-labelled speciﬁc ligands from rat
striatal or cortical synaptosomes with a range of concentrations of selected compounds.11;12 on the premise
that drugs with beneﬁcial eﬀects in the treatment of both
negative schizophrenia symptoms and depressive disorders may combine partial agonism at 5-ht1a receptors
and inhibition of synaptosomal 5-ht reuptake mechanism,13 we also tested several active compounds (1–3)
for their in vitro inhibitory potency on the 5-ht reuptake.11 compound 2 was selected for in vivo tests,
regarding its adequate 5-ht2a / xxxg656xxx  binding ratio, proposed for ‘atypicality’5 (1.14>1, pki values). in
order to explore atypical neuroleptic potential of 2,
dose–response behavioural tests for its cataleptogenic
potency12;14 and inﬂuence on d-amphetamine (amph)
induced changes in open-ﬁeld behaviour, registered by
photocell counts,12;15 were performed on rats.

during the last decade, we followed the strategy focused
on drug design and synthesis of mixed da-ergic/5-htergic compounds with a possible atypical neuroleptic
potential. one of the synthetic approaches was design
and synthesis of heterocyclic arylpiperazines, with a
speciﬁc structure of heteroaryl group, that mimics catechol moiety of the dopamine (benzimidazole, substituted benzimidazoles, benztriazoles and 1,4-dihydroquinoxaline-2,3-diones). variations of heterocyclic and
aryl groups had produced over 100 new compounds that
were screened for their aﬃnities at bovine brain d1 , d2
and 5-ht1a receptors by in vitro radioligand binding
assays.10 the six most active compounds (table 1) were
selected for further pharmacological examinations.

2. pharmacology
the assorted compounds were evaluated by in vitro
assays for binding aﬃnities to the speciﬁc da (d1 , d2 ),
5-ht (5-ht1a , 5-ht2a , 5-ht2c and 5-ht3 ) and a1 adrenergic receptors. these receptors were chosen con-

3. results and discussion

order of magnitude (table 1). only two compounds (2
and 3) showed a higher aﬃnity for 5-ht2a than d2
receptors and this was more prominent for 2 (ki of 5.10
and 51.3 nm at 5-ht2a and d2 receptors, respectively).
compound 2 expressed a comparable aﬃnity to clozapine for the d2 , 5-ht2a and a1 -adrenergic receptors,
and somewhat lower aﬃnity for the 5-ht2c receptors. it
exhibited a poor aﬃnity at the  xxxg655xxx  and no
binding potency at the  xxxg1116xxx . on the other
hand, 2 showed a higher aﬃnity for the  xxxg1108xxx 
than clozapine (ki values of 90.2 and 415 nm, respectively) and a certain potential to inhibit in vitro synaptosomal 5-ht uptake (ic50 ¼ 260 nm). however, the
inhibitory strength of 2 for 5-ht reuptake, although
higher than that of compounds 1 and 3, seems to be
fairly low to take into account its possible antidepressive
ability by this mechanism, proposed for some new
atypical apds.6
simple behavioural tests revealed a possible atypical
neuroleptic potential of the selected compound 2. it did
not exhibit cataleptogenic eﬀect (0/6 animals after 1.0 or
10.0 mg/kg b.w. upon 30, 60, 90 or 180 min), while haloperidol induced catalepsy at 1.0 mg/kg in rats (4/5
animals after 30 min and 5/5 animals after 60, 90 and
180 min). also, no signiﬁcant changes in open ﬁeld
behaviour were observed in rats i.p. injected with compound 2 (1.0 or 10.0 mg/kg b.w.) when compared to
saline/dmso control (fig. 1). an attenuation of

amph-induced hyperlocomotion, a measure of antagonism of da d2 receptors located in nucleus accumbens,16 in animals pretreated with compound 2,
suggested a dose–response relation (fig. 1a). this
inhibitory eﬀect was slight after the lowest dose of 2
(1.0 mg/kg), moderate––following its middle dose
(3.0 mg/kg), and the most prominent (up to 8-fold
reduction of locomotion) after the highest dose of 2
applied, (10.0 mg/kg) throughout the 2 h period after
amph injection. the reduction of amph-induced
stereotypy by pretreatment with 2 was not so extensive
and expressed exclusively after the highest dose of 2
(fig. 1b), that is not completely in line with reported
failure of clozapine to antagonize amph generated
stereotypy.17 in fact, amph induces a behavioural
syndrome in mammals that includes a variety of repetitive behaviours, where some forms are either suppressed, augmented or without a change upon the action
of atypical apds.18 the procedures of automated
recordings, used to assess the stereotype response to
amph treatment, reduce these variations and oversimplify the evidence of these changes. however, our
unpublished data suggest that clozapine, given to rats at
10.0 mg/kg dose, may moderately reduce such amphinduced stereotypy score by similar pattern of compound 2 observed in the present study.
in summary, this communication promotes the interaction of some previously synthetized arylpiperazines
with a number of rat brain receptors. it seems that some
ligands with benztriazole group may express the most
favourable interactions with the speciﬁc da-d2 , 5-ht1a
and 5-ht2a receptors, regarding atypical antipsychotic
potential from the view of the ‘da–5-ht hypothesis’,4;5
where compound 2, 5-{2-[4-(2,3-dimethyl-phenyl)- xxxd2960xxx -1-yl]ethyl}1h-benztriazole, exhibited the most
suitable ht2a /d2 binding ratio, among compounds selected here. a proper aﬃnity of 2 for the 5-ht1a
receptor, but also for 5-ht2c and a1 receptors, may be
an additional factor strengthening the atypical neuroleptic potential of the compound, although there is a
controversy about the role the latter receptors play in
the antipsychotic action of clozapine-like drugs.3 however, the nature of these interactions has not been elucidated yet, as, for example, particular arylpiperazines
had been diversely reported to be agonists, partial agonists or antagonists at the  xxxg1108xxx .19 in vivo
tests may suggest that the type of interactions anticipated for some other atypical apds (partial agonism or
antagonism at the d2 receptors, strong  xxxg1113xxx 
antagonism, partial  xxxg1108xxx  agonism2;6–9 ) is
also appropriate for compound 2, but this needs further
clariﬁcation. also, the selected compounds should be
tested in the light of the loose binding concept for
atypical apds action3b and subjected to further preclinical tests.

test for catalepsy: all behaviour experiments were done
with adult mill–hill hooded male rats (b.w. 200–250 g).
catalepsy was scored by the horizontal bar test.12 the
animals (5–6 per group) were i.p. injected with saline/
dmso, compound 2 (1.0 or 10.0 mg/kg) or haloperidol
(1.0 mg/kg). the forepaws were placed on a 10 cm high
horizontal bar, while the hind paws remained on the ﬂoor.
an amount of time spent when at least one forepaw on bar
was determined. the animal was considered to be cataleptic
if it remained on the bar for at least 60 s. the test was
performed 30, 60, 90 and 180 min upon the treatment in
three trials. percentage of cataleptic animals was calculated.
test on open ﬁeld behaviour: two series of four and three
experimental groups (6–8 animals per group) were i.p.
given d-amph sulfate (5.0 mg/kg) or physiological saline.
compound 2 was originally dissolved in dmso (ﬁnal
conc. up to 2%), diluted with saline and i.p. injected 1.0,
3.0 mg (only amph group) or 10.0 mg in 2.0 ml volume
per kg b.w., 20 min before the d-amph (or saline) application; control group received only saline/dmso. motor
activity in an open ﬁeld test and stereotypy score were
monitored automatically in photo-beam activity cages with
a columbus auto-track system (version 3.0 a, columbus
institute, oh, usa), starting immediately after the ﬁrst
injection, ending 120 min upon the second treatment. the
individual amounts of locomotion (in cm) and stereotypic
activities were expressed at successive 10 min (before the
second injection) or 20 min periods. all experiments were
done on habituated animals (20 min before the ﬁrst
injection). statistical analysis was performed by nonparametric kruskal–wallis test followed by mann–witney utest (statistica for windows, 5.0, statsoft).
