abstract
the  xxxg682xxx  (egfr) is commonly overexpressed in many human tumors and provides a new target for anticancer
drug development.  xxxd2186xxx  (“iressa”), a quinazoline  xxxg2198xxx  inhibitor selective for the egfr, has shown good activity in preclinical
studies and in the early phase of clinical trials. however, because it
remains unclear which tumor types are the best targets for treatment with
this agent, the molecular characteristics that correlate with tumor sensitivity to  xxxd2186xxx  have been studied. in a panel of human breast cancer and
other epithelial tumor cell lines, her2-overexpressing tumors were particularly sensitive to  xxxd2186xxx . growth inhibition of these tumor cell lines
was associated with the dephosphorylation of egfr, her2, and  xxxg722xxx ,
accompanied by the loss of association of  xxxg722xxx  with phosphatidylinositol
3-kinase, and down-regulation of akt activity. these studies suggest that
her2-overexpressing tumors are particularly susceptible to the inhibition
of her family  xxxg2198xxx  signaling and suggest novel strategies to
treat these particularly aggressive tumors.

introduction
deregulated expression of tyrosine kinases through mutation, amplification, or deregulation is a hallmark of malignancy. overactivity of
these signaling proteins can lead to abnormal growth control and cellular
transformation. thus, selective inhibitors of specific tyrosine kinases
might prove to be effective anticancer agents. studies of the her family
of tyrosine kinases have been at the forefront of these efforts.
four members of the her family of transmembrane rtks3 are
known: egfr ( xxxg682xxx ,  xxxg682xxx ), her2 (neu, erbb2),  xxxg722xxx  ( xxxg722xxx ).
and  xxxg723xxx  ( xxxg723xxx ). these proteins share a common structural organization and an overall amino acid homology of 40 –50%. growth factor
signaling by the her family of rtks is marked by complexity at every
step because of the multiplicity of ligands, receptors, effectors, and
downstream pathways. more than 25 ligands are known, which bind
these rtks with various affinities, although a high-affinity ligand specific for her2 has not yet been reported, and this receptor may not have
a physiological ligand. although the four members of the her family
share many structural and functional characteristics, differences in tissue
expression and different phenotypes in gene-disrupted mice reveal that
each member performs nonredundant functions, and it remains unclear
what unique functions distinguish the individual family members (reviewed in ref. 1). the her family of rtks controls a complex process
of lateral signaling through ligand-induced homo- and heterodimerizareceived 3/13/01; accepted 8/17/01.

tions. these intra- and inter-receptor interactions define a hierarchical
array of possible signaling partners, which greatly complicates efforts to
understand their unique functions and pathways (2). activated receptors
interact with numerous cytoplasmic signaling proteins, and these interactions are dependent on specific dimerization partners generating additional signal diversification (1).
deregulated activity of her family rtks is commonly seen in human
tumors and is oncogenic in many experimental systems. egfr and
her2 are transforming in cell culture models and tumorigenic in transgenic mice when activated by overexpression, autocrine stimulation, or
mutation (3–5). amplification of egfr and her2 occurs in a subset of
human tumors including breast, lung, ovarian, and kidney cancers, and
glioblastomas (6). overexpression of her2 in breast and ovarian cancers
is associated with a particularly aggressive course and poor prognosis (7).
because these cancers share a well-defined common genetic abnormality,
much attention has focused on the development of therapies specifically
directed toward this subset of human cancers.
therapeutic mabs targeting the extracellular domains of egfr and
her2 have been developed and have shown efficacy in the treatment
of patients with cancer, and anti-her2 antibodies are now in widespread use in the management of patients with breast cancer (8).
advances in pharmaceutical technologies have led to the development
of small-molecule inhibitors of tyrosine kinases with a high degree of
molecular specificity for her family rtks, and many of these agents
are now ready for clinical testing. agents that selectively inhibit these
targets afford a useful tool for determining their oncogenic function in
certain tumors.
the  xxxg2198xxx  inhibitor  xxxd2186xxx  (“iressa”) is a synthetic
anilinoquinazoline  xxxg2198xxx  inhibitor selective for egfr. it
inhibits egfr in vitro with an ic50 of 27–33 nm4 and is competitive
with atp and noncompetitive with peptide substrates. it has much
lower activity against related rtks, with an ic50 of 2 ␮m and 20 ␮m
for her2 and  xxxg1274xxx , respectively. because  xxxd2186xxx  has good oral
bioavailability and demonstrated antitumor activity in a broad range
of mouse xenograft models, it was selected for clinical development
(9). phase i trials of  xxxd2186xxx  in patients with solid tumors refractory
to standard chemotherapeutic agents have shown good tolerability and
evidence of antitumor activity against such tumors (10, 11). these
successes have led to additional clinical development, and additional
clinical trials are currently underway to better determine its potential
in the treatment of cancer patients.
we have studied the molecular basis for the sensitivity of some
tumors to  xxxd2186xxx . we find that, although this agent selectively
inhibits egfr activity, tumors with her2 overexpression are particularly sensitive to it. treatment of her2-overexpressing tumors with
 xxxd2186xxx  results in dephosphorylation of her2 and profound downregulation of the pi3k/akt signaling pathway attributable to dephosphorylation of  xxxg722xxx . these results indicate that the clinical potential
of this agent is not limited to tumors with egfr overexpression and,
in fact, suggest that it may represent a novel modality in the treatment
of patients with her2-overexpressing tumors.

 xxxd2186xxx  inhibits her2-driven signaling and tumor growth

materials and methods
tumor cell lines were obtained from the american type culture collection
maintained in 1:1 mixture of dme:f12 medium supplemented with 100
units/ml penicillin, 100 ␮g/ml streptomycin, 4 mm glutamine, and 10% heatinactivated fetal bovine serum, and incubated at 37°c in 5% co2. du4475
cells were grown in rpmi 1640 with similar supplements. mcf10a cells were
grown in dme:f12 supplemented with 5% donor horse serum, 0.5 ␮g/ml
hydrocortisone, 10 ␮g/ml insulin, and 3 nm egf. for growth assays, cells were
seeded in six-well clusters at 20 –50,000 cells/well. later (24 h), the cells were
placed in fresh medium containing  xxxd2186xxx  and allowed to grow for 4 –10
days, depending on the cell line. when control wells were near semiconfluent,
cells were harvested by trypsinization and counted using a coulter counter.
western blots were performed by harvesting total cellular lysates in ripa
buffer [10 mm sodium phosphate (ph 7.2), 150 mm nacl, 0.1% sds, 1%
np-40, 1% sodium  xxxd1835xxx , and protease inhibitors], separating 50 ␮g of
each lysate by sds-page, and transferring to membrane. immunoblot analyses were performed using antibodies specific for egfr (trans. labs;
e12020), her2 (neomarkers; ab-15),  xxxg722xxx  (neomarkers; ab-2),  xxxg723xxx 
(neomarkers; ab-2), and phospho-akt (cell signaling; 9271), and visualized
by enhanced chemiluminescence and autoradiography. quantitative analysis of
akt activity was performed by imaging the autoradiograms in a bio-rad
geldoc 2000 in white light and quantitating relative band densities using
quantity one software (bio-rad).
transfections were performed as follows. skbr3 cells were seeded at 2
million cells/10-cm dish and were transfected with 2 ␮g of psg5p110␣caax (kindly provided by julian downward, icrf, london, united
kingdom) the following day or psg5 control using lipofectin reagent (life
technologies, inc.). after 24 h, cells were placed in medium containing
indicated concentrations of  xxxd2186xxx  for 30 min, and total lysates were harvested and analyzed by western blotting as described above.
receptor phosphorylation assays were performed as follows. ripa lysates were
immunoprecipitated with the relevant antibodies, separated on sds-page, transferred to membrane, and immunoblotted using antiphosphotyrosine antibodies
(santa cruz; py99). immunoprecipitations were performed using monoclonal
anti-egfr (calbiochem; gr13), monoclonal anti-her2 (neomarkers; ab-4),
and monoclonal anti- xxxg722xxx  (neomarkers; ab-4) antibodies. all of these antibodies were against epitopes within the extracellular domains of the receptors, and
previous titering experiments had established the amount of lysate and antibody
that would maximally immunoprecipitate the target protein.

results
sensitivity of egf-dependent growth to  xxxd2186xxx . because
 xxxd2186xxx  is a potent inhibitor of egfr in vitro, we initially studied its
efficacy in inhibiting egfr-dependent cell growth. mcf10a cells
are nontransformed breast epithelial cells that require egf to proliferate. the monolayer growth of these egf-driven untransformed cells
is inhibited by  xxxd2186xxx  with an ic50 of 20 nm, similar to its ic50 in
vitro for egfr and consistent with effective inhibition of egfr in
vivo. however, higher concentrations (0.5–20 ␮m) are required for
growth inhibition in tumor cell lines, with considerable differences
between different tumor cell types. this suggests that the inhibition of
tumor growth may involve additional mechanisms. to better understand the differences in the sensitivity of tumors to  xxxd2186xxx , we
studied the effects of  xxxd2186xxx  in a panel of human epithelial tumors.
sensitivity of her2-overexpressing tumors to  xxxd2186xxx . because the function of egfr is closely linked to the function of its
family members her2,  xxxg722xxx , and  xxxg723xxx , the expression of the her
family of rtks in these cells was correlated with their sensitivity to
 xxxd2186xxx . overexpression of egfr and her2 is seen commonly in
breast cancers, so we initially studied the antitumor effects of  xxxd2186xxx 
in a panel of 10 breast cancer cell lines. in these cells we find that
her2-overexpressing tumors (skbr3, bt474, mda-mb-361, and
mda-mb-453) are more sensitive to  xxxd2186xxx  than others, with ic50s
under 10 ␮m, and among these the tumors with the highest her2
expression (skbr3 and bt474) are the most sensitive, with ic50s of

0.8 and 0.3 ␮m (fig. 1, lanes 1–10). interestingly, the cell line with
amplification and overexpression of egfr (mda-mb-468) is not as
sensitive to  xxxd2186xxx , with an ic50 of 13 ␮m. to determine whether the
correlation between her2 overexpression and  xxxd2186xxx  sensitivity
holds in other tumor types, we extended our analysis to additional
tumor cell lines of different origins. this analysis included the her2overexpressing ovarian cancer cells skov3, which are sensitive to
 xxxd2186xxx , with an ic50 of 2 ␮m and confirms that her2-overexpressing tumors are particularly sensitive to  xxxd2186xxx  (fig. 1, lanes 12–18).
unlike mda-mb-468 cells, the egfr-overexpressing tumor a431 is
sensitive to  xxxd2186xxx  with an ic50 of 0.7 ␮m making it difficult to
establish a definite correlation between egfr overexpression and
drug sensitivity. however, it is evident from mda-mb-468 cells that
egfr overexpression is not sufficient to determine sensitivity to
 xxxd2186xxx . there is no apparent correlation between the expression of
 xxxg722xxx  or  xxxg723xxx  with tumor sensitivity in these cells.
receptor dephosphorylation. the four members of the her
kinase family are closely related. although  xxxd2186xxx  is a relatively
selective inhibitor of egfr in vitro, it may have broader effects in
cells. therefore, we studied the effects of  xxxd2186xxx  on the tyrosine
phosphorylation of each receptor family member in the drug-sensitive
skbr3 cells, which are growth-inhibited with an ic50 of 0.8 ␮m. at
concentrations ⬎1 ␮m, and in ⬍30 min,  xxxd2186xxx  reduces the basal
phosphorylation of egfr but also of her2 and  xxxg722xxx  (fig. 2a).
down-regulation of the pi3k/akt pathway. egfr and her2
activate a number of cytoplasmic signal transduction pathways of
which the ras/map kinase pathway has been the best defined. we
have studied whether inhibition of this pathway may be mediating the
antitumor effects of  xxxd2186xxx . however, in mcf-7 and mda-mb-468
cells, 1 ␮m of  xxxd2186xxx  inhibits egfr-induced map kinase signaling
(data not shown) yet has no effects on cell growth at this concentration. thus far we have not found a correlation between map kinase
inhibition and  xxxd2186xxx  sensitivity.
another downstream signaling event initiated by her kinase stimulation is recruitment and activation of pi3k at the cell membrane leading
to activation of the cytosolic  xxxg1377xxx  akt.  xxxd2186xxx  downregulates akt activity within 30 min in some tumor cell lines. this rapid
down-regulation of akt activity is predominantly seen in tumors that are
sensitive to  xxxd2186xxx  such that down-regulation of akt activity is a marker
of tumor response to  xxxd2186xxx  (figs. 1 and 3). in fact, akt downregulation is a better correlate of tumor sensitivity than her2 overexpression, because a431 cell growth and akt activity are very sensitive to
 xxxd2186xxx , yet these cells do not overexpress her2. du145 cells are also
partially sensitive to  xxxd2186xxx  and show a decline in akt activity but no
overexpression of her2. there is no decline in total akt expression in
these experiments (data not shown).
to determine whether  xxxd2186xxx  treatment down-regulates akt activity through down-regulation of pi3k activity, we transfected the
 xxxd2186xxx -sensitive skbr3 cells with an activated pi3k construct. p110caax is a modified p110 that has a cooh-terminal caax motif.
this motif signals post-translation prenylation leading to membrane
localization and activation. expression of constitutively active pi3k
prevents the down-regulation of akt activity by  xxxd2186xxx  supporting
the hypothesis that  xxxd2186xxx  down-regulates akt activity through
inhibition of pi3k activity (fig. 4). although the resistance to  xxxd2186xxx 
in p110-caax-transfected cells appears incomplete here, this represents only the subset of cells that were successfully transfected,
because these are transient transfections.
the activation of pi3k by her family proteins is thought to occur
predominantly through association of the sh2 domain of the p85
regulatory subunit of pi3k with several tyrosine-phosphorylated binding sites on the cytoplasmic domain of  xxxg722xxx . because  xxxd2186xxx 
treatment of her2-overexpressing tumors results in  xxxg722xxx  dephos-

phorylation, we hypothesized that this would lead to loss of  xxxg722xxx 
association with p85, and our experiments corroborate this hypothesis.
immunoprecipitation of egfr, her2, and  xxxg722xxx  from the her2overexpressing skbr3 cells results in coimmunoprecipitation of p85
with  xxxg722xxx  but not with egfr or her2, and this association is lost
at concentrations of  xxxd2186xxx  ⬎1 ␮m in parallel with the reduction in
the phosphorylation of  xxxg722xxx  (fig. 2b).
combination treatment of her2-overexpressing tumor cells.
because  xxxd2186xxx  may have clinical application in the treatment of
patients with her2-overexpressing breast cancers, and such patients
may benefit from combination therapies, we tested the efficacy of
monoclonal anti-her2 antibodies (traztuzumab [herceptin]) in combination with  xxxd2186xxx  in cell culture. treatment of skbr3 cells with
trastuzumab and  xxxd2186xxx  shows that the growth inhibitory activities
of these two agents are additive (fig. 5).

expression. although in vitro this agent shows the highest activity
against egfr, it is apparent from our analysis of two egfr-overexpressing tumor types, mda-mb-468 and a431, that overexpression
of egfr is not sufficient to determine sensitivity to  xxxd2186xxx . it
remains possible that the consequences of egfr overexpression are
modified by other molecular lesions in the tumor. for example,
mda-mb-468 cells may be driven by overexpression and overactivity of egfr, but their relative resistance to  xxxd2186xxx  may be attributable to the failure to down-regulate akt activity, because these cells
have a deletion of the pten tumor suppressor protein (12). thus, the

discussion
selective inhibition of  xxxg2198xxx  activity is a promising strategy for cancer treatment.  xxxd2186xxx  is one of the first  xxxg2198xxx 
inhibitors to be tested in patients with advanced solid tumors. initial
studies have shown promising results, and additional clinical trials are
in progress to additionally define the activity and toxicities of this new
treatment modality. we have been interested in how this agent inhibits
the growth of tumor cells and which subset of tumors may be most
effectively treated by this agent. in a survey of human tumor cell lines,
we find that tumors with her2 overexpression are particularly sensitive to  xxxd2186xxx . there is no correlation with  xxxg722xxx  or  xxxg723xxx

 xxxd2186xxx  inhibits her2-driven signaling and tumor growth

fig. 3. cells were placed in medium containing 0, 0.1, 1, or 10 ␮m of  xxxd2186xxx  for 30 min and then harvested rapidly on ice in ripa buffer. total cellular lysates were separated on
sds-page, transferred to membrane, and blotted with anti-phospho-akt (ser473) antibodies (cell signaling). akt phosphorylation was assayed as a correlate of akt activity. it should be noted
that the baseline expression of akt and phospho-akt varies considerably among the different cell lines, and to enable analysis of declines in akt activity, increased total lysates and longer
exposures were used for cells with low signal. therefore, these experiments are designed to compare akt activity within each cell line and not for comparison between cell lines. quantitative
analysis of akt activity was performed on the immunoblots as described in “materials and methods” and plotted for each cell line using the 0 ␮m arm as control.

assumption that egfr overexpression per se will determine sensitivity to egfr-targeted therapies such as  xxxd2186xxx  may turn out to be
over-simplistic.
although  xxxd2186xxx  shows relative selectivity for egfr in vitro, our
data show that in tumors it leads to reduced basal phosphorylation of
egfr, her2, and  xxxg722xxx . the reduction in phosphorylation of these
receptors occurs at low ␮m concentrations and correlates with the
antitumor activity of this agent. at these concentrations,  xxxd2186xxx  is
not selective for egfr in vitro and, in fact, inhibits the her2 kinase
domain in vitro with an ic50 ⫽ 1.2–3.7 ␮m.4 therefore, it is difficult
to know, based on these studies alone, whether  xxxd2186xxx  inhibits
tumors through the inhibition of egfr or her2, or perhaps both.
because her2-overexpressing tumors are thought to be driven by
overactivity of her2, the sensitivity of these tumors to  xxxd2186xxx 
would suggest that the inhibition of her2 is most important in these
tumors, and this remains a distinct possibility based on these studies.
however, because her2 functions preferentially as a heterodimer
with other her family members including egfr resulting in receptor
transphosphorylation egfr may play an important role in the growth
of her2-overexpressing tumors. her2 readily dimerizes with egfr
in vivo (2), and cells transfected with egfr and her2 have increased
basal phosphorylation of these two receptors (13). in transgenic models of breast cancer driven by her2 and transforming growth factor
␣ overexpression, inhibition of egfr by a selective  xxxg2198xxx 
inhibitor suppresses tumor formation (14). it is possible that the
oncogenic activity of her2 requires phosphorylation by egfr. understanding the precise role and importance of the egfr in human
her2-overexpressing breast cancers requires additional studies.

egfr and her2 affect the activity of a number of cytoplasmic
signal transduction pathways, and it remains unclear which pathways
are most important for maintaining the transformed phenotype in
her2-overexpressing tumors. numerous effector molecules associate
with  xxxd1075xxx  residues within the cytoplasmic domains of
her kinases. these include grb2, shc,  xxxg1895xxx , plc␥, cbl, p85 subunit
of pi3k, and others that associate selectively with specific members of
the her kinases on specific  xxxd1075xxx  residues (reviewed in
ref. 1). we have shown that the down-regulation of the pi3k/akt
pathway correlates with the antitumor effects of  xxxd2186xxx . this suggests that the pi3k/akt pathway may be important in driving tumor
growth, especially in her2-overexpressing tumors. additional studies are required to determine the effects of  xxxd2186xxx  on other effector
molecules and signaling pathways. although  xxxd2186xxx  is effective in
inhibiting the egfr-ras-map kinase pathway, this is not sufficient
for inhibition of growth in some tumor cells. future studies will
attempt to define the role of this pathway in maintaining tumor
growth.

fig. 4. skbr3 cells were transfected with an activated pi3k construct (p110-caax) or
vector control. after transfection (24 h), cells were treated with increasing concentrations
of  xxxd2186xxx  for 30 min, harvested, total protein quantitated, and akt activity assayed by
western blotting as described previously using anti-phospho-akt antibodies.

therapies of active agents may prove even more efficacious. in our
preliminary analysis,  xxxd2186xxx  shows activity in cell culture models of
her2-overexpressing tumors and additive activity with therapeutic
anti-her2 antibodies. the clinical relevance of these findings awaits
clinical trials of  xxxd2186xxx  in patients with her2-overexpressing
tumors.

fig. 5. skbr3 cells were seeded in six-well clusters and the following day placed in
medium containing increasing concentrations of  xxxd2186xxx  and trastuzumab. cells were
allowed to grow and counted on day 5, and results shown reflect the average of duplicate
wells.

inhibition of akt activity correlates well with and is a marker of
sensitivity of tumor cells to  xxxd2186xxx . akt down-regulation correlates
better with tumor sensitivity than her2 overexpression, as demonstrated by two cell types that do not overexpress her2. a431 cells are
very sensitive to  xxxd2186xxx , which inactivates their akt activity. du145
prostate cancer cells are partially sensitive to  xxxd2186xxx , which partially
inhibits their akt activity. it is difficult to make broad conclusions
regarding the importance of akt down-regulation in  xxxd2186xxx  sensitivity in different tumor types, because the signaling pathways that
drive the growth of different types of cancer are probably different.
our data suggest that the down-regulation of akt activity by
 xxxd2186xxx  is mediated through down-regulation of pi3k activity. this is
consistent with current models of her family signaling through pi3k.
pi3k is activated after egf stimulation, and this activity is seen in
egfr immunoprecipitates in certain studies (15). however, the sh2
domain recognition sequence for the p85 regulatory subunit of pi3k is
not found on egfr or her2, and additional analysis has shown that
p85 associates directly with  xxxg722xxx , which has seven repeats of the p85
recognition sequence (16). therefore, activation of pi3k by egfr or
her2 occurs through the phosphorylation of  xxxg722xxx . egfr may also
activate pi3k through additional intermediaries of which several are
currently known including  xxxg723xxx , ras, the platelet-derived growth
factor ␤ receptor (17), and the docking protein gab1 (18). in our
survey,  xxxg722xxx  is expressed in most of the tumor cell lines that are
sensitive to  xxxd2186xxx  and may be driving the pi3k activity in these
cells. the one exception is skov3 cells, which have low  xxxg722xxx 
expression. however, these cells express  xxxg723xxx , which contains a p85
binding site (19) and which may also be recruiting pi3k.
the findings presented here have significant clinical relevance.
although  xxxd2186xxx  was developed because of its in vitro selectivity for
inhibition of egfr, it is apparent from our studies that its clinical
testing should not be confined to patients with egfr-overexpressing
tumors. moreover, our data suggest that the clinical efficacy of
 xxxd2186xxx  should also be tested in patients with her2-overexpressing
tumors. her2 overexpression is commonly seen in breast cancers,
and these tumors are associated with a particularly poor prognosis.
considerable efforts have focused on the development of treatments
for this tumor subtype. in fact the use of therapeutic mabs against the
extracellular domain of her2 in patients with her2-overexpressing
tumors has resulted in significantly improved survival (20). additional therapies targeted toward her2 signaling pathways may con-
