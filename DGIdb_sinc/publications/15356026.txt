we examined the effect of pioglitazone (pio) on circulating
adipocytokine levels to elucidate the mechanisms by which
thiazolidinediones improve insulin resistance in type 2 diabetes mellitus (t2dm). twenty-three subjects with t2dm (age
54 ⴞ 2 yr, body mass index 29 ⴞ 1 kg/m2) were randomly assigned to receive placebo (n ⴝ 11) or pio, 45 mg/d (n ⴝ 12), for
4 months. before and after treatment, subjects received a 75-g
oral glucose tolerance test (ogtt); euglycemic insulin clamp
(40 mu/m2䡠min) with 3-3h-glucose; determination of fat mass
(3h2o); and measurement of fasting glucose, free  xxxd2154xxx 
(ffas), leptin, adiponectin, and tnf␣ concentrations. after 4
months of pio, fasting plasma glucose concentration (⌬ ⴝ ⴚ2.7
mol/liter), mean plasma glucose during ogtt (⌬ ⴝ ⴚ3.8 mol/
liter), and hemoglobin a1c (⌬ ⴝ 1.7%) decreased (p < 0.05 vs.
placebo) without change in fasting or post-ogtt plasma insulin levels. fasting ffas (⌬ ⴝ 168 ␮mol/liter) and tnf␣ (⌬ ⴝ
0.7 pg/ml) concentrations decreased (p < 0.05 vs. placebo),
whereas adiponectin (⌬ ⴝ 8.7 ␮g/ml) increased (p < 0.01 vs.
placebo). despite the increase in body fat mass (⌬ ⴝ 3.4 kg)

t

he thiazolidinediones (tzds) represent a new
class of insulin-sensitizing agents that have proven
effective in the treatment of patients with type 2 diabetes
mellitus (t2dm). tzds initiate their action by binding to a
specific nuclear receptor termed the peroxisome proliferator
activated receptor (ppar)-␥ (1, 2), and their binding affinity
to ppar␥ is closely related to their in vivo antihyperglycemic
potency (3, 4). ppar␥ is found in high concentration in
adipocytes (1), whereas its concentration in muscle and liver,
the primary tissues responsible for the maintenance of glucose homeostasis (glucose disposal and production, respectively), is low (1). consistent with their tissue distribution,
ppar␥ activation causes preadipocytes to differentiate into
mature fat cells and causes the induction of key enzymes
involved in lipogenesis (1, 5, 6). although tzd therapy in

after pio, plasma leptin concentration did not change significantly. no changes in plasma glucose, ffas, or adipocytokine
levels were observed in placebo-treated subjects. during the
insulin clamp, endogenous (hepatic) glucose production decreased (⌬ ⴝ ⴚ2.67 ␮mol/fat-free mass䡠min, p < 0.05 vs. placebo), whereas metabolic clearance rate of glucose (mcr) increased (⌬ ⴝ 0.58 ml/fat-free mass䡠min, p < 0.05 vs. placebo)
after pio. in all subjects, before and after pio, the decrease in
plasma ffa concentration was correlated with the changes in
both endogenous (hepatic) glucose production (r ⴝ 0.47, p <
0.05) and mcr (r ⴝ ⴚ0.41, p < 0.05), whereas the increase in
plasma adiponectin concentration was correlated with the
change in endogenous (hepatic) glucose production (r ⴝ
ⴚ0.70, p < 0.01) and mcr (r ⴝ 0.49, p < 0.05). these results
suggest that the direct effects of pio on adipose tissue to
decrease plasma ffa levels and increase plasma adiponectin
contribute to the improvements in hepatic and peripheral
insulin sensitivity and glucose tolerance in patients with
t2dm. (j clin endocrinol metab 89: 4312– 4319, 2004)

t2dm patients consistently is associated with weight gain
(7–11), glycemic control improves and the increase in body
weight is positively related with the reduction in hemoglobin
a1c (hba1c) (11–13). these results suggest that the improvement in glucose homeostasis after tzd treatment may, in
some way, be related to an alteration in lipid metabolism
and/or fat topography.
recently adipose tissue has been recognized as an important source of metabolically active secretory products (adipocytokines), including free  xxxd2154xxx  (ffas), leptin, tnf␣,
il-6, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, resistin, and adiponectin (14). the deleterious effect of elevated plasma ffa
levels on hepatic and muscle insulin sensitivity are well
documented (15–19). however, the relationship between
these other adipocytokines and hepatic/muscle insulin sensitivity in t2dm subjects has been less well studied. tnf␣,
which is expressed in adipocytes from lean individuals, is
overexpressed in large adipocytes from obese people and has
been shown to cause insulin resistance in both animals (20)
and humans (21) through impairment of insulin-mediated
signaling pathways (22). deficient leptin secretion by adipocytes causes profound obesity in rodents (23) and humans
(24), and leptin has been shown to exert important effects on
glucose metabolism in rodents (25). although restoration of
leptin levels to normal in leptin-deficient rodents ameliorates
the insulin resistance independent of its effects on food intake and body weight (26), the relationship between plasma

miyazaki et al. • pio effects on adipocytokines and insulin sensitivity

leptin levels and insulin resistance in t2dm has been poorly
studied in humans. most recently, the adipocytokine, adiponectin, and its role in the modulation of glucose and lipid
metabolism has received considerable attention. decreased
plasma adiponectin levels have been demonstrated in a variety of insulin-resistant states, including obesity and t2dm,
in both animals and humans (27–30). although the mechanisms by which adiponectin enhances insulin action in muscle and liver are unclear, it has been reported in animal
studies that adiponectin enhances insulin-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of the  xxxg1194xxx  in skeletal
muscle (27) and decreases hepatic expression of the glucogenic enzymes, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase, and
glucose-6-phosphatase (31).
in the present double-blind, placebo-controlled study, we
evaluated the effect of pioglitazone therapy on circulating
adipocytokine levels (ffa, leptin, tnf␣, adiponectin) and
their relationship to changes in body fat mass, glucose tolerance, and hepatic and peripheral tissue sensitivity to insulin, in t2dm individuals.
subjects and methods

j clin endocrinol metab, september 2004, 89(9):4312– 4319 4313

study design
the study was double blind and placebo controlled in design. during
the 4 wk before randomization, the fpg was measured on four occasions
at weekly intervals, and in each subject the variability was less than 5%.
during this 4-wk period, subjects met with the dietitian for 45 min and
were instructed to consume a weight-maintaining diet containing 50%
carbohydrate, 30% fat, and 20% protein. during the week before randomization, all subjects received: 1) a 75-g oral glucose tolerance test
(ogtt); 2) measurement of lean body mass and fat mass using an iv
bolus of 3h2o; and 3) euglycemic insulin clamp in combination with
tritiated glucose to examine hepatic and peripheral tissue sensitivity to
insulin. after completion of these studies, subjects were assigned randomly in a double-blind fashion to receive either placebo or pioglitazone, 45 mg/d, with breakfast for 4 months. subjects returned to the
clinical research center of texas diabetes institute at 0800 h every 2 wk
for measurement of fpg, body weight, and blood pressure. on each visit
adherence to a weight-maintaining diet was reinforced, and no attempt
was made during the study to change these dietary instructions. fasting
plasma lipids [total cholesterol, triglyceride, high-density lipoprotein
(hdl) cholesterol, and low-density lipoprotein (ldl) cholesterol] were
measured monthly. hba1c was measured on the last day of the baseline
and treatment periods. all studies were performed in the postabsorptive
state at 0800 h after an overnight 10- to 12-h fast. subjects omitted their
dose of sulfonylurea on the morning of the day of the study. during the
last week of the double-blind period, the ogtt, euglycemic insulin
clamp, and body fat measurement were repeated.

subjects
twenty-three patients with t2dm were recruited from the outpatient
clinic of the texas diabetes institute (table 1). all subjects were taking
a stable dose of sulfonylurea drug for at least 3 months before the study
and remained on the same dose of sulfonylurea throughout the study
period. patients who previously had received insulin, metformin, or any
tzds were excluded. entry criteria included age from 30 to 70 yr, body
mass index (bmi) less than 36 kg/m2, and fasting plasma glucose concentration (fpg) between 140 and 240 mg/dl. all patients were in good
general health without evidence of cardiac, hepatic, renal, or other
chronic diseases as determined by history, examination, and screening
blood tests. subjects were not consuming any medicines known to affect
glucose metabolism, and none were participating in an excessive physical activity program. all subjects gave signed, voluntary, informed
consent before participation. the protocol was approved by the institutional review board of the university of texas health science center
at san antonio.

ogtt
baseline blood samples for determination of plasma glucose, ffas,
insulin, and c-peptide concentrations were drawn at ⫺30, ⫺15, and 0
min. at time zero each subject ingested 75 g glucose in 300 ml orangeflavored water, and plasma glucose, ffas, insulin, and c-peptide were
measured at 15-min intervals for 2 h. at time zero, a 100-␮ci bolus of
3
h2o was given and plasma-tritiated water radioactivity was determined at 90, 105, and 120 min for calculation of fat-free mass (ffm) and
fat mass (fm) as previously described (32).

euglycemic insulin clamp
insulin sensitivity was assessed with the euglycemic insulin clamp,
as previously described (33). on arrival (0800 h) at the clinical research
center, blood for measurement of fpg was obtained. a primed (25
␮ci ⫻ fpg/100)-continuous (0.25 ␮ci/min) infusion of [3-3h]glucose
was started at time ⫺180 min via a catheter placed into an antecubital
vein and continued throughout the study. a second catheter was placed
retrogradely into a vein on the dorsum of the hand, which was then
placed in a heated box (60 c). baseline arterialized venous blood samples
for determination of plasma [3-3h]glucose radioactivity and plasma
glucose and insulin concentrations were drawn at ⫺30, ⫺20, ⫺10, ⫺5,
and 0 min. at time zero, a prime-continuous infusion of human regular
insulin ( xxxd2364xxx , novo nordisk pharmaceuticals, princeton, nj) was
started at a rate of 40 mu/min⫺1䡠m⫺2 body surface area and continued
for 120 min. after initiation of the insulin infusion, the plasma glucose
concentration was allowed to drop until it reached 5 mmol/liter, at
which level it was maintained by appropriately adjusting a variable
infusion of 20% dextrose (33). throughout the insulin clamp, blood
samples for determination of plasma glucose concentration were drawn
every 5 min, and blood samples for determination of plasma insulin and
[3-3h]glucose radioactivity were collected every 10 –15 min.

assays
plasma glucose was measured at bedside using the glucose oxidase
method (glucose analyzer 2, beckman instruments inc., fullerton, ca).
plasma insulin (diagnostic products corp., los angeles, ca) and cpeptide (diagnostic systems laboratories inc., webster, tx) concentrations were measured by ria. hba1c was measured by affinity chromatography (biochemical methodology, drower 4350; isolab, akron,
oh). plasma ffa was measured by enzymatic calorimetric quantification (wako chemicals gmbh, neuss, germany). plasma total cholesterol and triglycerides were measured enzymatically (roche molecular

biochemicals, indianapolis, in) on a hitachi 704 autoanalyzer. hdl
cholesterol was measured enzymatically on a hitachi 704 autoanalyzer
after precipitation of chylomicrons and very low-density lipoprotein and
ldl cholesterol by phosphotungstic acid. ldl cholesterol was calculated from the friedwald equation. tritiated glucose specific activity was
determined on deproteinized plasma samples. tnf␣ concentration was
determined with an elisa kit for human tnf␣ (quantikine, r&d
systems, minneapolis, mn). this is a very sensitive sandwich elisa
with a lower detection limit of 0.5 pg/ml and intraassay and interassay
coefficients of variation of 5.7 and 7.5%, respectively. fasting plasma
leptin and adiponectin concentrations were determined by ria (linco
research inc., st. charles, mo).

calculations
under steady state, postabsorptive conditions the rate of endogenous
glucose appearance (ra) is calculated as the [3-3h]glucose infusion rate
(disintegrations per minute per minute) divided by the steady-state
plasma [3-3h]glucose specific activity (disintegrations per minute per
milligram). during the insulin clamp, nonsteady conditions prevail, and
ra was calculated from steele’s equation (34). endogenous glucose
production (egp) was calculated as: egp ⫽ ra minus glucose infusion
rate (gir). total glucose disposal ( xxxg9xxx ) equals the sum of egp plus gir
after a very small correction for any change in the plasma glucose
concentration. total body glucose metabolic clearance rate (mcr) equals
the  xxxg9xxx  divided by the plasma glucose concentration, where  xxxg9xxx  is
expressed as milligram per kilogram ffm per minute, and plasma
glucose is expressed as milligram per milliliter.
total body water was calculated from the mean plasma 3h2o radioactivity at time 90, 105, and 120 min after the iv bolus of 3h2o. plasma
3
h2o-specific activity was calculated, assuming that plasma water represents 93% of total plasma volume. fat-free mass (ffm) was calculated
by dividing total body water by 0.73 (35).
the area under the glucose, insulin, c-peptide, and ffa curves during the ogtt were determined using the trapezoidal rule. the mean
plasma glucose, insulin, and ffa concentrations during the ogtt were
calculated by dividing the area under the curve by the duration of the
ogtt (120 min).

statistical analysis
statistic analyses were performed with statview for windows, version 5.0 (sas institute inc., cary, nc). differences between values before
and after treatment (i.e. within the placebo and within the pioglitazone
groups) were analyzed using the paired student’s t test. comparison
between the placebo and pioglitazone groups was performed using
anova with bonferroni/dunn post hoc testing when appropriate. linear regression analysis was used to examine the relationships between
the changes in hepatic and peripheral tissue insulin sensitivity and the
changes in circulating concentrations of plasma ffa, tnf␣, leptin, and
adiponectin before and after pioglitazone treatment. all data are presented as the mean ⫾ se. p ⬍ 0.05 was considered to be statistically
significant.

clinical characteristics and metabolic measurements

demographic characteristics of the patients are summarized in table 1. the placebo and pioglitazone-treated groups
were similar in age, race, duration of diabetes, bmi, fasting
insulin and c-peptide concentrations, plasma lipids levels,
fm, and ffm. fpg and hba1c were slightly, although not
significantly, higher in the pioglitazone vs. placebo group.
there were more men in the pioglitazone group. however,
it is known that females respond better to tzds than men
because they have a greater percent body fat (10). before
randomization the plasma leptin concentration was slightly,
although not significantly higher in the placebo group, perhaps because of the greater number of women in this group.

hba1c and fasting plasma glucose, c-peptide, and triglyceride concentrations in the pioglitazone group (p ⬍ 0.05–
0.001 vs. baseline and vs. placebo) (table 2). there was no
significant change from baseline in any parameter in the
placebo group (table 2).
during the ogtt (fig. 1), mean plasma glucose (16.3 ⫾ 0.7

baseline and vs. placebo) without change in the plasma insulin concentration after pioglitazone treatment. there were
no significant changes in plasma levels of glucose, insulin,
and ffa after placebo treatment.
euglycemic insulin clamp

during the pretreatment insulin clamp, the steady-state
(90 –120 min) plasma glucose (5.7 ⫾ 0.4 vs. 5.4 ⫾ 0.3 mmol/
liter) and insulin (69 ⫾ 8 and 77 ⫾ 8 ␮u/ml) concentrations
were similar in the pioglitazone and placebo groups, respectively. after 16 wk of pioglitazone and placebo treatment, the
steady-state plasma glucose and insulin concentrations were
similar to those in the baseline insulin clamp study.
before treatment, the basal rate of egp was similar in the
pioglitazone (15.56 ⫾ 0.56 ␮mol/kg ffm per minute) and

16 wk of treatment (pioglitazone ⫽ 15.56 ⫾ 0.56 ␮mol/kg

discussion

in the present double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled
study, we examined the effect of 16 wk of pioglitazone
(45 mg/d) treatment on fasting adipocytokine (ffa, tnf␣,
leptin, and adiponectin) levels in t2dm subjects and related
changes in these circulating adipocytokines to changes in
body composition, glycemic control, and peripheral and
hepatic insulin sensitivity. consistent with previous findings
from our laboratory and others (12, 13, 36 – 41), we demonstrated that pioglitazone lowered the hba1c and fasting
plasma glucose concentration and improved glucose tolerance in t2dm patients without significant change in the
plasma insulin concentration, indicating enhanced tissue
sensitivity to insulin. the improvement in insulin sensitivity
was confirmed with the euglycemic insulin clamp/tritiated
glucose technique, which demonstrated that both peripheral

tissues (muscle) and liver were responsible for the amelioration of insulin resistance (fig. 2).
recent studies demonstrated that the adipocyte is a metabolic factory capable of producing a number of adipocytokines (14). of these adipocytokines,  xxxd2154xxx  have been the
most extensively studied (15–19, 42). however, the adipocyte
also produces a variety of other adipocytokines that play
important roles in regulating glucose and lipid metabolism
(adiponectin, resistin, tnf␣, leptin), the coagulation cascade
(plasminogen activator inhibitor-1), and inflammation (il-6,
resistin, tnf␣) (14). in the present study, we focused on the
effect of tzds on those adipocytokines that have been shown
to play an important role in the regulation of glucose metabolism in animals and humans with t2dm.
many investigators have demonstrated that tzd treatment reduces the fasting plasma ffa concentration by approximately 20 –30% and that this decrease is paralleled by
a 20 –30% reduction in fasting plasma glucose concentration
and hba1c in t2dm patients (8, 10, 13, 36 –38, 43). in agreement with these previous clinical studies, pioglitazone reduced both the fasting and post-ogtt plasma ffa by 25–
35%,and the reduction in plasma ffa concentration was
correlated with the decreases in hba1c, fasting plasma glucose concentration, and mean plasma glucose during the
ogtt as well as with the increases in hepatic and peripheral
(muscle) insulin sensitivity. because elevated plasma ffas
are known to induce both hepatic and peripheral (muscle)
tissue insulin resistance (15–19, 44, 45), the present results
suggest a major insulin sensitizing action of the tzds in
media via their ffa lowering effect.
before the start of pioglitazone, the plasma adiponectin
concentration (7.4 ⫾ 0.8 ␮g/ml) in t2dm was decreased,
compared with values in healthy, age/gender/obesitymatched nondiabetic subjects studied in our laboratory
(8.9 ⫾ 0.5 ␮g/ml). after pioglitazone treatment the circulating adiponectin concentration increased in every diabetic
subject by a mean of 2.2-fold. the increment in plasma adiponectin concentration was strongly correlated with the increments in hepatic and peripheral (muscle) tissue insulin
sensitivity after pioglitazone treatment. we made similar
observations in an open-label pioglitazone trial in a completely separate group of t2dm subjects (46). to the best of
our knowledge, these two investigations represent the first
demonstration that the improvement in hepatic insulin sen-

ffa (left) and plasma adiponectin (right) concentrations after treatment with placebo and pioglitazone.

sitivity after tzd therapy is closely associated with the increase in plasma adiponectin concentration. our results are
consistent with three previous reports that demonstrated
that tzd treatment increases plasma adiponectin levels in
concert with an improvement in peripheral tissue insulin
sensitivity (47– 49).
improved glycemic control also has been shown to be
associated with an increase in plasma adiponectin concentration in tzd-treated t2dm patients (50 –52). the precise
mechanism(s) by which adiponectin exerts its actions on
glucose metabolism and insulin sensitivity remain unclear.
coombs et al. (31) demonstrated that ip administration of
adiponectin to mice inhibited the expression of hepatic gluconeogenic enzymes and decreased egp. yamauchi et al. (27)
reported that adiponectin administration to rodents increased insulin-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of the
 xxxg1194xxx  in skeletal muscle in association with increased whole-body insulin sensitivity. the present results
are consistent with these results in animals (27, 31). in the
present study, we observed a strong correlation between the
increase in plasma adiponectin concentration and the decrease in both fasting and post-ogtt plasma ffa levels. this

is especially noteworthy because ffa infusion in humans
has been shown to inhibit the insulin signal transduction
system at the level of  xxxg1194xxx  substrate (irs)-1/
phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase ( xxxg1743xxx  kinase) (53), and we previously have shown that rosiglitazone treatment in t2dm
patients enhances  xxxg1198xxx  tyrosine phosphorylation, the association of  xxxg1198xxx  with  xxxg1743xxx  kinase, and  xxxg1743xxx  kinase activity (43).
moreover, these improvements in insulin signaling after rosiglitazone therapy were closely correlated with the reduction
in plasma ffa concentration. because the increase in plasma
adiponectin concentration in the present study was strongly
related with the reduction in plasma ffa levels, one could
postulate that the primary effect of adiponectin is to inhibit
lipolysis in adipocytes and/or increase fatty acid oxidation
in muscle (27), leading to a decrease in intracellular fatty acid
metabolites, i.e. fatty acyl  xxxd1739xxx , diacylglycerol, ceramides, and enhanced insulin signal transduction (54 –56).
alternatively, adiponectin may have a direct effect on the
insulin signaling cascade (27). we believe that it is unlikely
that the decrease in plasma ffa concentration is responsible
for the increase in plasma adiponectin after pioglitazone
because reduction in circulating ffa levels with acipimox
has no effect on the plasma adiponectin concentration (bajaj,
m. and r. a. defronzo, unpublished results).
in the present study, pioglitazone treatment was associated with a weight gain of 3.6 kg, and this was entirely
accounted for by an increase in fm of 3.5 kg. edema was
looked for carefully on every visit and was not observed in
any subject. despite the weight gain, oral glucose tolerance,
hba1c, and hepatic and peripheral tissue (muscle) insulin
sensitivity improved significantly. in fact, the greater the
increase in body weight, the greater the decrease in hba1c.
improved glycemic control, despite weight gain, has been
reported with other tzds (7, 9, 10, 13, 39, 41), including
troglitazone, pioglitazone, and rosiglitazone. several studies
demonstrated that tzd-induced weight gain is associated
with an increase in sc adipose tissue and a concomitant
decrease in visceral fat content (9, 12, 57). this redistribution
of fat is explained by the remodeling of fat tissue, associated
with differentiation of preadipocytes into small fat cells in sc
fat depots (58) and apoptosis of differentiated large hypertrophic adipocytes in visceral and sc fat depots (59, 60).
although similar quantitative measurements in human
t2dm patients have yet to be reported after tzd therapy,
such a scenario (52–54) would be consistent with the present
observations. because the newly formed fat cells possess all
of the enzymes required for lipogenesis and manifest increased insulin sensitivity with respect to glucose transport
and inhibition of lipolysis (58 – 61), this remodeling of adipose tissue also could explain the decline in plasma ffa
levels, resulting secondarily in enhanced hepatic and muscle
sensitivity to insulin.
in human and rodent models of obesity (29, 62), circulating
adiponectin levels are decreased. therefore, one would not
expect further weight gain, induced by pioglitazone, to result
in an increase in plasma adiponectin levels, as was observed
in the present study. moreover, if the weight gain was associated with enlarged fat cells, as occurs with overeating,
one might even expect to observe a further reduction in
plasma adiponectin concentration. we postulate that the dif-

ferentiation of preadipocytes into small fat cells in sc fat
depots, in association with enhanced expression of adiponectin mrna (52), is responsible for the increase in plasma
adiponectin after pioglitazone treatment.
pioglitazone treatment resulted in a significant decrease in
serum tnf␣ concentration. however, we failed to observe
any correlation between the decrease in circulating tnf␣
concentration and the improvements in glucose tolerance or
hepatic and peripheral tissue insulin sensitivity. however,
one cannot exclude a local paracrine effect of reduced tissue
tnf␣ levels in muscle or liver. although the plasma leptin
concentration correlated strongly with fm before treatment
(r ⫽ 0.53, p ⬍ 0.01), plasma leptin levels did not change after
pioglitazone treatment, despite the significant increase in
fm. because circulating leptin levels normally increase with
weight gain, the failure to observe any change in plasma
leptin concentration, despite a 3.5 kg increase in fm, also
suggests that the pioglitazone-induced increase in fm does
not simply represent the enlargement of adipocytes in the
body. the lack of change in circulating leptin levels after
pioglitazone treatment also suggests that this adipocytokine
does not contribute to the improvements in hepatic and
peripheral tissue (muscle) sensitivity to insulin.
in summary, the present results demonstrate that 16 wk of
pioglitazone treatment decreases the fasting and post-ogtt
plasma ffa levels, reduces the serum tnf␣ concentration,
and increases the plasma adiponectin concentration despite
weight gain in t2dm patients. consistent with previously
published results, pioglitazone also decreased the fasting
plasma glucose concentration, improved oral glucose tolerance, reduced hba1c, and enhanced hepatic and peripheral
tissue sensitivity to insulin. the reduction in plasma ffa
levels and increase in plasma adiponectin concentration after
pioglitazone treatment both were strongly associated with
the improvements in peripheral tissue (muscle) and hepatic
insulin sensitivity and glycemic control. these observations
enhance our understanding of the mechanism of action the
tzds in t2dm patients.
