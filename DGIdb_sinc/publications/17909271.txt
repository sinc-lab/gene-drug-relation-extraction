he ideal drug therapy for postoperative ileus (poi), a common
surgical complication, would
have several characteristics. it would
selectively antagonize the inhibitory
effects of all the potential factors
implicated in the pathophysiology of
poi (neurogenic, inflammatory, hormonal, and pharmacologic mediators) in the gastrointestinal (gi)
tract. currently, the most promising
target is inhibition of the effects of
endogenous and exogenous opioids
in the gi tract. mu-opioid receptors in the gi tract mediate reduced
motility in surgical patients receiving
postoperative opioid analgesic therapy.1 however, the ideal agent should
not penetrate the blood–brain barrier, where antagonism of central
opioid receptors would interfere with
analgesia, and should also be free of
agonist activity at µ-opioid receptors
in gi smooth muscle. in addition,
the ideal drug therapy for poi would
be available in oral and injectable
dosage forms for flexibility of administration. preferably, to minimize
potential systemic adverse effects,
oral dosage forms would not be systemically absorbed. furthermore, the

therapy for postoperative ileus (poi); the
pharmacology, efficacy, and safety of currently available nonselective opioid antagonists and the new peripherally selective
opioid antagonists  xxxd2614xxx  and
 xxxd134xxx  for the treatment of poi; and
formulary considerations associated with
the introduction of these new poi drug
therapies are discussed.
summary. the ideal drug therapy for
treating poi would selectively antagonize
the inhibitory effects on the gastrointestinal (gi) tract of all of the potential factors
implicated in the pathophysiology of poi
(neurogenic, inflammatory, hormonal,
and pharmacologic mediators). the most
promising target to date is inhibition of
the adverse gi effects of endogenous and
exogenous opioids. selective inhibition
of the µ-opioid receptors in the gi tract,
without reversing centrally mediated opioid-induced analgesia, may be beneficial
in reducing poi. the nonselective opioid
antagonists naloxone and nalmefene have
not been studied for poi, and they cross
the blood–brain barrier. therefore, they
are not appropriate for preventing or treating poi. the peripherally selective opioid
antagonist  xxxd2614xxx  shortens the
duration of poi and the hospital length of
stay (los).  xxxd134xxx , a more extensively
studied peripherally selective opioid
antagonist, has been shown to reduce the

duration of poi, frequency of postoperative nausea and vomiting, and hospital los.
both  xxxd2614xxx  and  xxxd134xxx 
also appear effective for treating opioidinduced constipation. preliminary results
of a long-term study of  xxxd134xxx  safety
have revealed some potential concerns, and
the significance of the adverse effects must
be understood before the most appropriate
role of  xxxd134xxx  in patient care can be
determined. restricting the prescribing of
new poi drug therapies to certain types of
patients, surgeries, and prescribers; incorporating these therapies into preoperative
and postoperative policies, procedures,
and protocols; and the potential cost
savings from reducing hospital los are
among the considerations in adding these
agents to health-system formularies.
conclusion. peripherally selective opioid
receptor antagonists are promising new
drug therapies that can reduce the clinical
and economic burden of poi.

emerging pharmacologic options

ideal poi treatment would be easy to
administer, well tolerated, and inexpensive, and it would not interact
with other drugs or disease states.
nonselective opioid antagonists
naloxone and nalmefene are nonselective tertiary opioid antagonists
that are currently available. neither
drug is selective for µ-opioid receptors in the gi tract (both drugs cross
the blood–brain barrier and act at
central receptors as well as peripheral
receptors).2 neither drug is approved
by the food and drug administration (fda) for the treatment of poi.
naloxone can antagonize the
effects of opioids in the gi tract;
however, it has never been evaluated in a prospective, randomized,
controlled trial for the prevention
or reduction of poi. in addition,
naloxone is not selective for gi
opioid receptors and can cross the
blood–brain barrier and lead to
reversal of anesthesia. 2,3 furthermore, the naloxone dose required
to reverse opioid effects is patientspecific and highly variable, and it
may cause withdrawal symptoms in
opioid-dependent patients.3,4 therefore, naloxone should not be used for
preventing or treating poi.
nalmefene hydrochloride is a
nonselective opioid-receptor antagonist, and like naloxone, it has never
been evaluated in a prospective,
randomized, controlled trial for the
prevention or reduction of poi.
nalmefene glucuronide, an inactive
metabolite of nalmefene hydrochloride, has demonstrated evidence of
selectivity for gi opioid receptors
in animal studies. because of this,
nalmefene glucuronide was evaluated
for the reduction of opioid-induced
constipation in humans.5 ascending
oral doses were used in five opioiddependent male volunteers who were
maintained on methadone therapy.5
nalmefene glucuronide was continued until laxation (i.e., a bowel
movement) or withdrawal symptoms occurred. in all five subjects,
s14

nalmefene glucuronide precipitated
withdrawal symptoms an average of
nine hours after its initiation. the
investigators surmised that the withdrawal effects were the result of biotransformation of the glucuronide to
the parent drug in the colon, which
was then systemically absorbed and
crossed the blood–brain barrier.
because of the lack of prospective
data and the potential to reverse
analgesia, neither nalmefene hydrochloride nor nalmefene glucuronide
should be used for preventing or
treating poi.
selective opioid antagonists
two novel quaternary opioid
antagonists with selectivity for peri­
pheral (i.e., gi) µ-opioid receptors,
 xxxd2614xxx  (figure 1) and
 xxxd134xxx  (figure 2), have been
developed that might prove useful

for the treatment of poi. neither
drug is currently approved by fda.
 xxxd2614xxx 
 xxxd2614xxx  is a quaternary
µ-opioid receptor antagonist that
was formed by adding a methyl
group to naltrexone. naltrexone is a
nonselective opioid antagonist that
crosses the blood–brain barrier and
can reverse opioid-induced analgesia and cause opioid withdrawal
symptoms in opioid-dependent
patients.6 the addition of the methyl
group results in the formation of a
protonated quaternary ammonium
group, thereby increasing the polarity of the molecule and conferring
low lipophilicity.  xxxd2614xxx 
does not penetrate the blood–brain
barrier.7 the drug is not demethylated to an appreciable extent in
humans.1,8

oral absorption of  xxxd2614xxx  is limited.6,9 the elimination half-life is about two to three
hours after i.v. administration,7,10 and
approximately 40–50% of an i.v. dose
is recovered in the urine (i.e., the kidneys play an important role in elimination of the drug).10–12 however, after
oral administration, less than 1% of
the unchanged parent drug is found
in the urine, which is likely due to the
limited oral absorption.9
steady state is achieved rapidly
with repeated i.v. doses (after two
to three doses), and accumulation
of the drug and alteration in pharmacokinetics do not occur with
repeated administration.10
 xxxd2614xxx  has been shown
to reverse opioid-induced slowing of gi transit time.9,12–14 it does
not antagonize the analgesic effect
of opioid analgesics or precipitate
withdrawal in opioid-dependent
patients.12,14 the drug is well tolerated, with mild to moderate abdominal cramping but no serious adverse
effects.10,11
two  xxxd2614xxx  dosage
forms have been explored in clinical trials. an injectable dosage
form has been evaluated in two
phase iii studies of patients with
opioid-induced bowel dysfunction
and a phase ii study of patients at
high risk of developing poi.15,16 obd
is a spectrum of adverse gi effects
associated with opioid use, including
constipation, abdominal pain and
distention, bloating, gastroesophageal reflux, hard dry stools, staining,
and incomplete evacuation. 2 two
phase i studies of oral uncoated
and coated  xxxd2614xxx  dosage forms have been completed in
healthy volunteers.9,13
in a phase iii, randomized, doubleblind, placebo-controlled study, 154
patients with opioid-induced constipation (i.e., no bowel movement for
48 hours) and advanced medical illness
were randomly assigned to receive a
single 0.15-mg/kg or 0.3-mg/kg dose
of  xxxd2614xxx  or placebo sub-

cutaneously (s.c.).15 laxation within
4 hours was the primary efficacy endpoint, and laxation within 24 hours
was a secondary endpoint.
both  xxxd2614xxx  doses were
significantly more effective than placebo in producing laxation within
4 hours and 24 hours after administration (p < 0.0001 for both doses and
laxation within 4 hours, p = 0.0004
for 0.15 mg/kg and laxation within
24 hours, and p = 0.0014 for 0.30 mg/
kg and laxation within 24 hours).15 the
percentage of patients with laxation
within 4 hours after drug administration was 58% with  xxxd2614xxx 
0.3 mg/kg (the higher dose), 62%
with  xxxd2614xxx  0.15 mg/kg
(the lower dose), and 13% with placebo. the percentage of patients with
laxation within 24 hours after administration was 64% with the higher
 xxxd2614xxx  dose, 68% with
the lower  xxxd2614xxx  dose,
and 33% with placebo. the median
time to laxation was significantly
shorter with both  xxxd2614xxx 
doses (45 minutes with 0.3 mg/kg
and 70 minutes with 0.15 mg/kg)
compared with placebo (>24 hours,
p < 0.0001 for both doses). the effect
of the drug appeared to be dose
related.
the most common adverse effects
from  xxxd2614xxx  were abdominal cramps and flatulence, with rates
of 30% to 40% and 15% to 20%,
respectively.15 opioid withdrawal was
not reported.
the impact of  xxxd2614xxx 
on the duration of poi was evaluated
in a phase ii, randomized, doubleblind study of 65 patients who
underwent segmental colectomies.16
patients were randomly assigned to
receive  xxxd2614xxx  0.3 mg/kg
or placebo i.v. every six hours beginning within 90 minutes after surgery
and continuing for up to seven days
or until no more than 24 hours had
elapsed after gi recovery, which
was defined as the ability to tolerate
solid food and having the first bowel
movement.

compared with placebo,  xxxd2614xxx  significantly reduced
the average time until the patient
could tolerate full liquids (70 hours
versus 100 hours with placebo,
p = 0.05) and the time to the first
bowel movement (97 hours versus
120 hours with placebo, p = 0.01).16
 xxxd2614xxx  also shortened the
average time until the patient could
tolerate solid foods (100 hours versus 125 hours with placebo) and the
time to gi recovery by about one full
day (124 hours versus 151 hours),
although these differences were
not significant. patients treated
with  xxxd2614xxx  were eligible
for hospital discharge significantly
sooner (after 119 hours on average)
than patients treated with placebo
(149 hours, p = 0.03). the mean time
to actual discharge was about one full
day shorter in the  xxxd2614xxx 
group (140) hours than in the placebo
group (165 hours), a difference that
was not significant.
 xxxd2614xxx  was well tolerated, with no serious adverse effects.16
there were no differences in pain
scores between the two groups. four
 xxxd2614xxx -treated patients
and nine placebo-treated patients
withdrew from the study. the most
commonly reported adverse effects
were fever and nausea, and the frequency of these effects was similar in
the two groups.
the  xxxd2614xxx -associated
shortening of the duration of poi
and hospital length of stay (los) by
about one day in this study is clinically significant and could translate
into substantial cost savings.16 two
phase iii, randomized, double-blind,
placebo-controlled, parallel-group
studies of i.v.  xxxd2614xxx  in
patients with poi are under way.17,18
one of these studies will enroll 495
adults who have undergone segmental colectomy by open laparotomy.17
the primary endpoint is the time
between the end of surgery and the
first bowel movement. august 2007

of the study. in july 2006,  xxxd2614xxx  received fast-track designation from fda, which expedites the
regulatory review process.19
 xxxd134xxx 
 xxxd134xxx  (formerly known as
 xxxd134xxx ) is a quaternary µ-opioid
receptor antagonist with a pharmacologic profile that differs from that
of  xxxd2614xxx .  xxxd134xxx  has
considerably greater binding affinity for µ-opioid receptors than for
d- and k-opioid receptors.20  xxxd2614xxx  binds preferentially to
µ-opioid receptors, but it is not
highly selective for µ-opioid receptors compared with d- and k-opioid
receptors.21  xxxd134xxx  has higher
binding affinity for µ-opioid receptors than does  xxxd2614xxx .21
the clinical significance of these differences remains to be determined.
 xxxd134xxx  has a moderately
large molecular weight and low
lipophilicity, so it does not cross the
blood–brain barrier.20 the drug has
limited oral bioavailability (about 6%
in humans) and a short half-life of
about 2.4–5.5 hours after oral administration of a single dose.22 the major
route of excretion is fecal; the kidneys
play a negligible role in elimination of
the drug after oral dosing.23
 xxxd134xxx  reverses opioidinduced slowing of gi transit time
and constipation without antagonizing the analgesic effect of opioid analgesics or precipitating withdrawal
in opioid-dependent patients.22,24–26
it has been studied in patients with
opioid-induced bowel dysfunction
(obd) and patients at high risk of
developing poi.26–31
opioid-induced bowel dysfunc­
tion. the use of  xxxd134xxx  for the
treatment of obd was explored
in several phase ii and phase iii
studies. one phase iii randomized,
placebo-controlled study involved
168 patients with obd (defined as
less than three bowel movements per
week) who had been receiving opioid
analgesic therapy (the equivalent of
s16

at least 10 mg/day of oral morphine)
for at least one month for nonmalignant pain or opioid dependence.26
patients were randomly assigned to
receive a single daily dose of  xxxd134xxx  0.5 or 1 mg or placebo for 21 days.
the average percentage of patients
having at least one bowel movement within eight hours after study
drug administration each day during the 21-day treatment period was
significantly higher with  xxxd134xxx 
1 mg (54%) and 0.5 mg (43%) than
placebo (29%, p < 0.001). the effect
of  xxxd134xxx  appeared to be dose
related. the median time to the first
bowel movement was significantly
shorter after the first dose of  xxxd134xxx  1 mg compared with placebo
(3 hours versus 21 hours, respectively, p < 0.001). the median time
to first bowel movement was also
shorter after the first dose of  xxxd134xxx  0.5 mg (7 hours), but this was
not statistically significant.
 xxxd134xxx  was well tolerated;
18 of 54 (33%) of patients in the
placebo group, 22 of 58 (38%) of
patients in the 0.5-mg group, and 27
of 56 (48%) of patients in the 1-mg
group experienced at least one of
the most common adverse effects.26
the most common adverse effects
were abdominal cramping, nausea,
vomiting, diarrhea, and flatulence.
the authors described most of these
effects as mild to moderate in severity
and were transient, resolving within
one week.  xxxd134xxx  did not antagonize opioid-induced analgesia.
postoperative ileus. the efficacy
and safety of  xxxd134xxx  for the treatment of poi have been evaluated
in several phase iii, randomized,
double-blind, placebo-controlled trials involving patients who underwent
major abdominal surgery for bowel
resection or hysterectomy.27–30 in three
of these studies,  xxxd134xxx  6 mg and
12 mg or placebo was given orally at
least two hours before surgery and
twice daily after surgery for up to seven
days or until hospital discharge.27–29
the time to gi recovery, a composite

measure of the time to toleration of
solid food or passage of flatus or stool
(whichever occurred later), was used
as the primary efficacy endpoint, and
this endpoint was known as gi-3.
because the time to passage of flatus
is subjective and reporting may be
unreliable, a composite measure of
the time to toleration of solid food or
passage of stool was used as a secondary efficacy endpoint (gi-2). the time
to readiness for hospital discharge,
time to writing of the discharge order,
visual analogue scale pain scores, daily
postoperative opioid analgesic consumption, frequency of postoperative

gi function, and safety also were
evaluated.
adult men and women (at least
18 years old) who were scheduled to
undergo major abdominal surgery as
described above were enrolled in the
studies.27–29 patients who had recently
received opioid analgesics (within the
previous one to four weeks, depending on the study protocol), patients
currently using nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs or epidural
opioid analgesics or local anesthetics,
and patients with severe concomitant
diseases were excluded. all patients
received standardized postoperative
care, with opioid analgesics administered by patient-controlled analgesia,
removal of the ng tube at the end
of surgery, oral liquids offered and
ambulation encouraged on postoperative day 1, and solid food offered
on postoperative day 2.
in one of the phase iii poi studies
involving 451 patients who underwent partial colectomies or simple
or radical hysterectomies,  xxxd134xxx  6 mg significantly reduced the
time to endpoint gi-3 from an average of 100.3 hours with placebo to
86.2 hours with  xxxd134xxx  6 mg, a
difference of about 14 hours (hazard
ratio [hr], 1.45; p = 0.003).27 compared with placebo,  xxxd134xxx  6 mg
also significantly reduced the time
to endpoint gi-3 among a subset

symposium

of patients undergoing partial colectomy or radical hysterectomy by
16.9 hours (hr, 1.51; p = 0.004)
and the time to endpoint gi-2 in
all patients by 15 hours (hr, 1.46;
p = 0.007). the time to reach these
outcomes in the  xxxd134xxx  12-mg
group tended to be lower than in
the placebo group but did not reach
statistical significance. the time to
writing of the discharge order was
significantly shorter in the  xxxd134xxx 
6-mg group (108 hours) compared
with the placebo group (122 hours,
p = 0.033), while the time in the  xxxd134xxx  12-mg group (115 hours)
was shorter than in the placebo
group but did not reach statistical
significance. the time to readiness
for hospital discharge was significantly shorter with both  xxxd134xxx 
6 mg (97 hours, p < 0.001) and 12 mg
(98 hours, p = 0.004) than with
placebo (112 hours). opioid analgesic consumption was similar in the
 xxxd134xxx  6-mg and placebo groups
and was significantly higher in the
 xxxd134xxx  12-mg group compared
with placebo (p = 0.045). pain control
measured with visual analogue scales
was similar in all three groups.
the authors described that  xxxd134xxx  was well tolerated, with similar
rates of adverse effects in the placebo
and  xxxd134xxx  groups.27 the most
common adverse effects were nausea
and vomiting. the frequency of these
effects was slightly lower in the  xxxd134xxx  6-mg group and 53% lower
in the  xxxd134xxx  12-mg group compared with the placebo group (suggesting that the reduction in nausea
and vomiting from  xxxd134xxx  was
dose dependent). in the  xxxd134xxx 
12-mg group, the rates of vomiting
(15%) and constipation (6.8%) were
significantly lower than in the placebo group (32% and 14.4%, respectively). the percentage of patients
withdrawing from the study because
of adverse effects was similar with
placebo (15%) and  xxxd134xxx  12 mg
(16%) and lower with  xxxd134xxx 
6 mg (7%). however, the percentage

emerging pharmacologic options

of patients withdrawing from the
study for any reason was higher in the
 xxxd134xxx  12-mg group (27%) than
in the placebo group (21%) and the
 xxxd134xxx  6-mg group (16%). the
investigators surmised that the unexpected efficacy results in the  xxxd134xxx  12-mg group (i.e., the apparent
lack of dose-related efficacy) might
be attributed to the high rate of study
withdrawal in that group.
a previously published phase iii
poi study of  xxxd134xxx  6 mg, 12 mg,
or placebo evaluated 469 patients
undergoing large or small bowel
resection or radical hysterectomy.29
there were no significant differences
among the groups with respect to the
mean age, mean or median duration
of surgery, or intraoperative opioid
analgesic use. the average daily
postoperative opioid analgesic consumption was significantly higher
(p values not reported) in the  xxxd134xxx  6-mg group (33.6 mg) than in
the  xxxd134xxx  12-mg (27.1 mg) and
placebo groups (27.0 mg), but the
investigators did not consider these
differences clinically significant.
in this study,  xxxd134xxx  had doserelated effects on the time to both
endpoint gi-3 and endpoint gi-2
that were significantly different from
placebo.29 endpoint gi-3 occurred
after an average of 120 hours in
the placebo group compared with
105 hours in the  xxxd134xxx  6-mg
group (p < 0.05 versus placebo) and
98 hours in the  xxxd134xxx  12-mg
group (p < 0.001 versus placebo). similarly, endpoint gi-2 occurred after an
average of 133 hours, 113 hours, and
105 hours with placebo,  xxxd134xxx 
6 mg, and  xxxd134xxx  12 mg, respectively (p = 0.013 for  xxxd134xxx  6 mg
versus placebo and p < 0.001 for
 xxxd134xxx  12 mg versus placebo).
the time to writing of the hospital
discharge order was 146 hours with
placebo, 133 hours with  xxxd134xxx 
6 mg, and 126 hours with  xxxd134xxx 
12 mg. the difference between the
12-mg dose and placebo was significant (p = 0.003), but also represents

a potential reduction in length of
hospital stay of nearly one day, which
is also clinically important.
 xxxd134xxx  was generally well tolerated in this study.29 the frequency
of adverse effects was generally
similar among the placebo, 6-mg,
and 12-mg groups, although the
authors did not describe the severity
of any adverse effects. nausea and
vomiting were the most commonly
reported adverse effects, and  xxxd134xxx  appeared to reduce the frequency
of nausea in a dose-dependent
manner (64% in the placebo group,
61% in the  xxxd134xxx  6-mg group,
and 55% in the  xxxd134xxx  12-mg
group). this antiemetic effect of
 xxxd134xxx  may be an added benefit
in surgical patients who receive opioid analgesics.
the frequency of postoperative
ng tube reinsertion was 14.8% in
the placebo group, 8.4% in the  xxxd134xxx  6-mg group, and 4.8% in the
 xxxd134xxx  12-mg group.29 the difference between placebo and the 12-mg
dose was significant (p = 0.004). the
frequency of poi as a treatmentrelated adverse effect (i.e., prolonged
poi) was 15.8% in the placebo group
compared with 8.3% in the  xxxd134xxx  6-mg group (p = 0.043) and
6.3% in the  xxxd134xxx  12-mg group
(p = 0.005).
the percentage of patients who
were rehospitalized for any reason
within 10 days after discharge was
lower in  xxxd134xxx -treated patients
(approximately 4%) than in placebotreated patients (approximately
8%).29 these findings suggest that
 xxxd134xxx  use may allow safe early
discharge of patients undergoing
major abdominal surgery.
an additional phase iiib study of
 xxxd134xxx  was completed, and the
results were recently reported.31 this
was a randomized, double-blind,
placebo-controlled study of 654
patients, but there were several differences between this study protocol
and the previous phase iii studies.
this study included only patients

emerging pharmacologic options

undergoing laparotomy for small or
large bowel resection (i.e., patients
undergoing hysterectomy were not
among the study population); it
only evaluated the  xxxd134xxx  12-mg
dose compared with placebo (i.e.,
no 6-mg group); and the preoperative  xxxd134xxx  dose was given 30–
90 minutes before surgery (rather
than at least two hours before
surgery), and dosing was continued
postoperatively for up to seven days
or until discharge, as was done in
previous studies. the results of this
study were consistent with previous phase iii  xxxd134xxx  studies.
there were no significant differences
between the two groups in preoperative, intraoperative, or postoperative
opioid analgesic consumption. the
mean time to achieve the primary
endpoint of gi-2 was significantly
shorter in the  xxxd134xxx  group
(92 hours) compared with the placebo group (112 hours, p < 0.001).
the frequency of poi-related postoperative morbidity (defined as
postoperative ng tube reinsertion or
poi resulting in prolonged hospital
stay or readmission) was significantly lower in the  xxxd134xxx  group
(7%) than the placebo group (14%,
p = 0.003). the average hospital
stay was significantly shorter in the
 xxxd134xxx  group (5.2 days) than in
the placebo group (6.2 days). this
finding was significant (p < 0.001),
and a one-day reduction in average los also represents a clinically
significant outcome. if hospital los
after laparotomy and bowel resection
could be reduced, this could result in
significant cost savings to the health
care system and improved patient
satisfaction.
 xxxd134xxx  was well tolerated; the
most commonly reported adverse
effects were nausea, vomiting, and
abdominal distention. 31 the frequency of nausea and vomiting in
the  xxxd134xxx  group (58% and 14%,
respectively) were significantly lower
than in the placebo group (66%
and 25%, respectively; p = 0.030 for
s18

nausea and p < 0.001 for vomiting).
there was no significant difference
between  xxxd134xxx  and placebo in
the frequency of abdominal distention (18% and 20%, respectively).
the authors did not describe the
severity of the adverse effects.
the promising results of this and
other phase iii studies suggested that
fda would likely approve the 12-mg
dose of  xxxd134xxx  to reduce poi
in patients undergoing laparotomy
and bowel resection. however, the
fda issued an approvable letter in
november 2006 calling for additional
safety data and a risk management
plan because of preliminary findings
from an ongoing safety study of  xxxd134xxx  (study 014).32 this study was a
phase iii, blinded, placebo-controlled,
long-term (12-month) safety evaluation of  xxxd134xxx  0.5 mg twice daily
for the treatment of obd in patients
with chronic noncancer pain. a sixmonth interim analysis revealed an
increase in the frequency of serious
cardiovascular events in alvimopantreated patients compared with
placebo-treated patients that was not
significant but nevertheless was concerning. the affected patients were at
high risk for cardiovascular disease,
and the risk of serious cardiovascular
events did not appear to be related to
the duration of  xxxd134xxx  use. these
cardiovascular events were consistent
with epidemiological expectations for
the patient population, and at that time
the combined results of all patients in
the population with chronic disease
who received  xxxd134xxx  did not suggest that they were at higher risk for
serious cardiovascular events.
this study was recently completed,
and the results were reported in a
press release.33 a total of 805 patients
were enrolled and randomized in a
2:1manner (i.e., 538 patients in the
 xxxd134xxx  group and 267 in the
placebo group). the proportion of
patients who experienced serious
adverse events was similar between the
 xxxd134xxx  and placebo groups (13%
and 11%, respectively), but there was

am j health-syst pharm—vol 64 oct 15, 2007 suppl 13

a “numerical imbalance” in serious
cardiovascular events (myocardial
infarction [mi] and all cardiovascular events) and neoplasm cases in
the  xxxd134xxx  group.33 in study 014,
2.6% of patients in the  xxxd134xxx 
group experienced serious adverse
events compared with 1.12% in the
placebo group. the cardiovascular
events occurred in patients with high
risk for cardiovascular disease. seven
patients in the  xxxd134xxx  group had
mis; no patients in the placebo group
had an mi. five of the mis occurred
at two investigational sites and did
not appear to be related to the duration of  xxxd134xxx  treatment. most
of the mis occurred during the first
12 weeks of treatment.
a higher number of neoplasms
was also observed in the  xxxd134xxx 
group (15, 2.8%), with four considered serious, compared with the
placebo group (2, 0.7%). in addition,
the frequency of fractures was higher
in patients receiving  xxxd134xxx , but
this is in contrast to previous studies, which demonstrated a similar
or lower rate. currently, the manufacturers of  xxxd134xxx  (adolor and
glaxosmithkline) have suspended
all studies of the drug until the data
can be further analyzed and the significance of study results is better
understood. the companies’ complete response to the fda approvable
letter with respect to the use of  xxxd134xxx  to reduce poi was targeted
for the third quarter of 2007.34
formulary considerations
the potential approval by the
fda of  xxxd2614xxx  and  xxxd134xxx  will prompt pharmacy and
therapeutics committees to evaluate
these agents for inclusion in healthsystem formularies and consider
establishing criteria for the safe
and cost-effective use of the drugs.
criteria for patient selection might
restrict use of the drugs to patients
undergoing bowel resection or
possibly other abdominal surgeries
associated with a higher risk of poi

symposium

(e.g., total abdominal hysterectomy).
these agents may also be approved
for the treatment of obd in patients
receiving chronic opioid therapy, but
additional data are needed to determine optimal criteria and uses. there
are several unanswered questions
with respect to the use of  xxxd2614xxx  and  xxxd134xxx  for reducing
poi. it is not clear whether these
agents would be beneficial in patients
undergoing laparoscopy, a procedure
associated with less bowel manipulation, less pain, lower opioid analgesic
requirements, and a shorter duration
of poi and hospital stay compared
with laparotomy.35–37 in addition, it is
not currently known if preoperative
dosing of these medications would
be required for maximal benefit.
all of the studies of  xxxd134xxx  for
reducing poi required preoperative
dosing. the ongoing studies with
 xxxd2614xxx  will initiate the
medication after surgery. the most
important issue is the concern about
safety with  xxxd134xxx . the complete
study results need to be analyzed,
published, and better understood
before the most appropriate use of
 xxxd134xxx  can be determined. if cardiovascular safety remains a concern
after the results of study 014 become
available, restrictions could be placed
on the use of  xxxd134xxx  in patients
with cardiovascular disease. in addition, there is no evidence to date
demonstrating precipitation of opioid
withdrawal symptoms in opioiddependent patients by either  xxxd2614xxx  or  xxxd134xxx . however,
the studies for reduction of poi have
excluded opioid-dependent patients;
the use of these agents for the reduction of poi might be restricted in
such patients until additional safety
data are available.
institutional preoperative and
postoperative policies, procedures,
and protocols will need to be modified to ensure the optimal use of a
new drug therapy for reducing poi.
the timing of drug administration
with respect to surgery, route of

emerging pharmacologic options

administration, location of administration in the hospital, and patient
convenience should be considerations in modifying policies, procedures, and protocols.
the approval of  xxxd2614xxx 
and  xxxd134xxx  would likely have a
financial impact on health systems.
the acquisiton cost of the drugs is
unknown. restricting use of these
drugs to certain types of surgical
procedures (e.g., open laparatomy
with bowel resection, hysterectomy),
prescribers (e.g., gi or gynecologic
surgeons), or both could limit the
impact on the pharmacy budget of
adding either drug to the formulary
and could encourage appropriate use
for optimal patient outcomes. substantial cost savings could be realized
from the reductions in hospital los
observed in some clinical trials of
 xxxd2614xxx  and  xxxd134xxx .16,31
whether the shortening of the time to
readiness for hospital discharge and
the time to writing of the hospital discharge order observed in some  xxxd134xxx  clinical studies translate into
safe reductions in actual los remains
to be confirmed.27,29
conclusion
 xxxd2614xxx  and  xxxd134xxx 
are promising new agents that could
become an important component of
perioperative care for the treatment
of poi after bowel resection and,
potentially, other major abdominal
surgeries. these therapies may also
reduce the economic burden of poi
on health systems.
