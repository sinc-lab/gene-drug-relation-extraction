previous studies have indicated that olanzapine decreases craving after a priming dose of alcohol, that craving after a priming dose of
alcohol is greater among individuals with the seven-repeat allele of the  xxxg658xxx  variable number of tandem repeats (vntr)
polymorphism, and that the effect of olanzapine (a d2/d4 antagonist) is more pronounced among individuals with this allele. the present
study tested the hypothesis that olanzapine may be differentially effective at reducing cue-elicited craving and differentially effective as a
treatment for alcohol dependence over the course of a 12-week, randomized, placebo-controlled trial among individuals with and
without the seven-repeat allele. participants who met dsm iv criteria for alcohol dependence were randomly assigned to receive
olanzapine (5 mg) or a placebo over the course of the trial. after 2 weeks of treatment, participants completed a cue reactivity
assessment. the results suggested that participants who were homozygous or heterozygous for the seven (or longer)-repeat allele of the
 xxxg658xxx  vntr responded to olanzapine with reductions in cue-elicited craving as well as reductions in alcohol consumption over the
course of the 12-week trial, whereas individuals with the shorter alleles did not respond favorably to olanzapine.

introduction
previous studies have suggested that currently accepted
pharmacotherapies (ie naltrexone,  xxxd1916xxx , and acamprosate) as well as medications currently under development
(eg ondansetron, topiramate, and aripiprazole) for alcohol
dependence are modestly effective. perhaps more importantly, it is becoming increasingly clear that these pharmacotherapies are more effective for some individuals than
others. for example, preliminary work has suggested that
naltrexone is more effective for individuals with a genetic
variant that changes the binding profile of the m-opioid
receptor (eg oslin et al, 2003). these findings have led
many to the conclusion that it is unlikely that we will have
one pharmacotherapy that is effective for the majority of
alcohol-dependent individuals. instead, it is likely that a
variety of pharmacotherapies will be developed, each of
which may target different mechanisms, and, at the same

time, target individuals who are vulnerable on these specific
mechanisms. based on this notion, it is imperative to begin
thinking about how best to test and develop treatments that
target specific mechanisms that play an important role in
the etiology of alcohol dependence and relapse. likewise, it
is equally important to describe individual differences in
these mechanisms that are likely to predict the treatment
outcome.
the action of alcohol and other drugs on the mesolimbic
dopamine pathways is thought to be an important
mechanism in the etiology of alcohol and drug dependence,
and, more specifically, the development of intense craving
and loss of control (berridge and robinson, 1998; robinson
and berridge, 1993; wise, 1988). while both the animal and
human literature suggests that mesolimbic and prefrontal
brain structures with dopaminergic connections are important, the role of specific dopamine receptor subtypes
remains unclear. however, recent studies have indicated
that the d2 family of dopamine receptors (d2, d3, and d4)
may play a critical role in incentive sensitization. for
example, d4 receptors are localized to the same structures
(eg orbitofrontal cortex, amygdala, and hippocampus) that
have been implicated in both animal and human models
of addiction and appetitive motivation (oak et al, 2000;
asghari et al, 1995; van tol et al, 1991). in addition,
selective  xxxg658xxx  antagonists block the sensitization of

olanzapine and the  xxxg658xxx  vntr
ke hutchison et al

1311

these dopamine pathways, suggesting that the  xxxg658xxx  is
important to the process of sensitization (feldpausch et al,
1998). d4 receptors that are localized in the shell of the
nucleus accumbens may modulate excitatory transmission
(svingos et al, 2000). this research suggests that the d4
receptor may be central to the development of incentive
sensitization and craving, and that the  xxxg658xxx  may be
generally involved in both the acquisition and expression of
incentive salience.
with respect to clinical research, previous studies have
indicated that craving for alcohol is diminished by
dopamine antagonists (modell et al, 1993), and that alcohol
and alcohol cues increase activation in the same neuronal
substrates that serve the process of incentive sensitization in
humans (modell and mountz, 1995). thus, the effect of
alcohol and alcohol cues on the activation of these
dopamine pathways represents a target that may prove to
be useful in terms of pharmacotherapy development, and
genetic variants that alter the functioning of these pathways
may prove to be important in terms of predicting the
success of such a pharmacotherapy. other research has
suggested that clozapine, a  xxxg658xxx  antagonist that is
somewhat similar to olanzapine, reduced substance abuse
among patients with comorbid substance abuse/dependence
(green et al, 1999) and, specifically, alcohol use (drake et al,
2000). thus, clinical research also supports an important
role for the d2 family of receptors, and specifically the d4
receptor.
given the potential importance of the dopamine pathways, and specifically the  xxxg658xxx , a series of studies
were conducted to examine whether a second-generation
d2/d4 antagonist (eg olanzapine) reduced craving for
alcohol and whether a functional variable number of
tandem repeats (vntr) polymorphism in the  xxxg658xxx 
gene ( xxxg658xxx ) might moderate these effects. the d4
dopamine receptor gene ( xxxg658xxx ) has a vntr polymorphism in exon 3, with common variants of two, four, and seven
repeats (van tol et al, 1992). previous work has suggested
that the seven-repeat allele either alters intracellular
function (asghari et al, 1995; oak et al, 2000) and/or
suppresses expression by altering mrna stability or
translational efficiency (schoots and van tol, 2003). the
first study found that olanzapine reduced craving after
exposure to the sight and smell of alcohol, as well as
consumption of small doses of alcohol (hutchison et al,
2001). a subsequent investigation found that the  xxxg658xxx 
vntr polymorphism moderated the effects of alcohol on
craving and other variables such that individuals with the
seven-repeat allele demonstrated significantly higher craving after consumption of alcohol as compared to the control
beverage, while individuals with the short-repeat alleles did
not (hutchison et al, 2002).
to replicate and extend the results with olanzapine and
the  xxxg658xxx  vntr, a third study was designed to examine
whether olanzapine (5 mg) reduced craving as compared to
 xxxd1785xxx  (4 mg), which was conceptualized as an
active control medication. olanzapine is a potent d4, d2, 5ht2, and h1 antagonist that may cause drowsiness, whereas
 xxxd1785xxx  is also a powerful 5-ht2 and h1 antagonist
that may cause drowsiness. thus,  xxxd1785xxx  represents an active control that can be used to better isolate the
effect of olanzapine and exclude alternative explanations (eg

drowsiness as a causal agent). it is important to note that
there are very few published studies that have used such a
stringent experimental control in a test of a pharmacological agent that targets alcohol craving. in this study,
olanzapine was found to be much more effective at
attenuating craving among individuals with the sevenrepeat allele (hutchison et al, 2003).
none of the aforementioned studies examined the effect
of olanzapine on drinking behavior in an alcohol-dependent
population. a recent report suggested that olanzapine did
not attenuate drinking in an alcohol-dependent population
(guardia et al, 2004). however, the investigators did not
stratify subjects by the  xxxg658xxx  genotype and they used doses
of olanzapine that were two to three times greater than the
doses shown to attenuate craving in our previous studies.
the objective of the present study was to extend our
previous results by testing the effects of olanzapine in an
alcohol-dependent population over the course of a 12-week
trial. more specifically, the present study utilized the dose of
olanzapine that was supported in our previous studies (ie
5 mg) and stratified patients by  xxxg658xxx  genotype. the effect
of olanzapine on cue-elicited craving was assessed after 2
weeks of treatment, while the effect of olanzapine on
drinking behavior was assessed after 4, 8, and 12 weeks of
treatment. consistent with our preliminary work, it was
hypothesized that olanzapine would decrease cue-elicited
craving and reduce drinking among the  xxxg658xxx  l individuals.

methods
participants
the present study was approved by the university of
colorado human research committee, and all subjects
provided written informed consent after receiving a full
explanation of the study. participants were recruited by
newspaper or radio advertisements. all female subjects
tested negative for pregnancy prior to participation, all
subjects were required to have a blood alcohol concentration of zero before each session, and all subjects were
required to be in excellent health, as indicated by a
thorough medical screening designed to ensure that there
were no contraindications for the use of the study
medication. subjects were also excluded if they met the
criteria for specific psychiatric diagnoses (ie bipolar
disorder, schizophrenia, bulimia, or anorexia nervosa),
reported a psychological disorder requiring pharmacotherapy, endorsed current use of illicit drugs other than
marijuana, or tested positive for the use of illicit drugs
other than marijuana. subjects were only included if they
met dsm iv criteria for alcohol dependence. furthermore,
there was a minimum drinking requirement of 14 drinks
(females) or 21 drinks (males) on average per week for four
consecutive weeks. participants also had to be within 21
days of their last drink to be included in the study.
research participants were screened medically at the
university of colorado at boulder general clinical research
center (gcrc). to be included in the trial, patients needed
a normal medical exam, cbc, ekg, urine toxicology screen,
and liver function tests that were within 3  the normal
limit. a total of 154 subjects were assessed for eligibility, 78

ke hutchison et al

1312

of whom met the full criteria for participation in the study.
of these 78, 13 did not start the trial within 21 days of their
last drink and were not included in the analyses.

medication administration procedures
prior to medication randomization, all participants were
instructed to remain abstinent from alcohol for a minimum
of 4 days. participants were randomized to olanzapine
or placebo. participants were instructed to take 2.5 mg
of the study medication (either olanzapine or a matching
placebo) for the first 5 days of treatment. on the sixth
day, participants increased to 5 mg per day dose for the
remainder of the 12 weeks. participants were also instructed
to take the medication 3 h prior to going to bed in order to
diminish the impact of any drowsiness experienced as a
result of the olanzapine. the participants were instructed to
report any side effects to the study physician or nurse at the
gcrc. at the discretion of the medical staff at the gcrc,
participants were instructed to decrease their dose back to
2.5 mg to alleviate side effects or discontinue the study
medication. over the course of the study, eight participants
in the olanzapine condition were reduced from the 5 mg
dose to the 2.5 mg dose, while two participants in the
placebo dose were reduced from 5 to 2.5 mg.
in order to confirm that participants took the medication,
the medications were packed into an opaque capsule with
50 mg of riboflavin. a urine sample was collected on the
morning of the experimental session. the urine sample was
tested for riboflavin content by examining it under an
ultraviolet light, a procedure that makes the riboflavin
detectable (del boca et al, 1996). none of the samples tested
negative for riboflavin content.

experimental procedures
individuals interested in the study called the laboratory
and completed a telephone screening assessment. eligible
participants were then invited to a secondary screening
visit, which consisted of a structured clinical interview
(structured clinical interview for dsm ivfscid clinician
version) assessing for alcohol dependence and concurrent
psychiatric diagnoses. in addition to the clinical interview,
participants completed the medical screening visit at the
gcrc during this initial appointment. as stated above, the
medical visit was designed to ensure that there were no
contraindications to the use of study medications.
eligible participants were invited back to the laboratory
for a baseline session (session 1), during which participants
completed measures of demographics, personality, alcohol
use, alcohol-related problems, and motivation for change.
at this time, participants also met with a therapist for the
psychosocial and medication management component of
this trial (described in detail below). at the end of session 1,
participants were randomized to receive either olanzapine
or placebo.
the cue reactivity session (session 2) took place 2 weeks
after session 1. following standardized procedures previously reported in the literature (eg rohsenow et al, 2000),
participants took part in a cue-exposure paradigm. in
general, this procedure involves comparing reactivity
between control cues (eg a nonalcoholic beverage) vs an
neuropsychopharmacology

alcohol-related cue (eg the preferred alcoholic beverage).
for the purposes of this study, gatorade was used as the
control cue, whereas the individuals’ favorite alcoholic
beverage served as the alcohol cue. during the control cue
exposure, participants were asked to lift and sniff the
gatorade, but were not allowed to taste the gatorade for a
period of 3 min. participants completed measures of mood
and craving (see below) before and after exposure to the
control cues. after a 5-min relaxation period, participants
repeated the cue exposure with their preferred alcohol
beverage and subsequently completed the same measures of
craving and mood. at the end of the cue exposure session,
participants met with a therapist to process their reactivity
to the cues, to discuss urge coping strategies, and to followup on their treatment goals.
participants were also assessed for outcome and side
effects during treatment on weeks 4, 8, and 12. lastly,
medication compliance was checked through a urine screen
at the beginning of session 2 and at each assessment visit.

brief psychosocial intervention
all participants receive two sessions of a brief structured
psychosocial intervention. these sessions took place at the
end of the baseline session (session 1) and the cue reactivity
session (session 2). the sessions consisted of providing
feedback on clients’ drinking behavior (measured by study
questionnaires), eliciting pros and cons about drinking
alcohol, setting treatment goals, and eliciting strategies for
achieving treatment goals. the therapists in the study were
three female doctoral students in clinical psychology at the
university of colorado at boulder. individual therapists
were crossed with treatment condition such that each
therapist worked with equal numbers of participants in each
of the medication conditions.

measures
during the first experimental session, participants completed a battery of individual difference measures that
included demographics, drinking behavior, personality
dimensions, and motivation for change. participants
also completed a series of outcome measures, including
medication side effects, starting 2 weeks after medication
randomization. in addition, measures of urge to drink
and affect were included to the cue-exposure paradigm,
conducted during the second experimental session. the
following measures were utilized in this study:

stages of change readiness and treatment eagerness scale
(socrates). this is a 19-item measure of motivational
processes associated with the stages of change model.
specifically, the socrates consists of three subscales
assessing recognition of alcohol-related problems (recognition subscale), uncertainty about drinking (ambivalence
subscale), and taking action to change drinking behavior
(taking steps subscale). the socrates has been shown to
be a valid and reliable measure of motivation for change
(miller and tonigan, 1996).
a 30- xxxd1861xxx -line follow-back procedure (tlfb; sobell
and sobell, 1980). this measure was used to assess the

quantity and frequency of drinking in the 30 days prior to
the experiment. consistent with previous outcome studies
(eg project match research group, 1998; monti et al,
2001; killeen et al, 2004), the primary outcome variables
were drinks per drinking day, total number of drinks, and
percent days abstinent.

reliability (bohn et al, 1995).

genomic dna was isolated from buccal cells using
published procedures (lench et al, 1988). the 48-bp vntr
in the third exon of the  xxxg658xxx  was assayed using previously
reported methods (sander et al, 1997). the primer
sequences were forward, 50 -aggaccctcatggccttg-30
(fluorescently labeled), and reverse, 50 -gcgactacg
tggtctactcg-30 (lichter et al, 1993). pcr conditions
were as follows: 200 mm of each of the four dntps, 2.5 mm
mgcl2, 200 nm forward primer (fluorescently labeled),
200 nm reverse primer, 40 ng of genomic dna, 1 u of
amplitaq gold polymerase (abi), and 1  pcr ii buffer
(abi) in a total volume of 20 ml. amplification was
performed with the following conditions: 951c for 10 min
(to activate the gold polymerase); 35 cycles of 941c for 30 s,
551c for 30 s, and 721c for 60 s; and a final elongation at
721c for 30 min. pcr products were electrophoresed in
4.25% polyacrylamide under denaturing conditions with
applied biosystems 3100. participants were classified as
 xxxg658xxx  l (ie homozygous or heterozygous for an allele x7
repeats; s/l or l/l), or were classified as  xxxg658xxx  s (ie both
alleles o7 repeats; s/s). table 1 provides the allele and

a series of analyses were conducted to determine whether
the medication   xxxg658xxx  groups differed on drinking and
demographic variables (see table 2 for the means and
standard deviations for the medication   xxxg658xxx  groups).
analyses of the baseline data suggested that the groups did
not differ on these variables including ethnic background.
thus, it is highly unlikely that population stratification,
gender, or other variables measured at baseline confounded
the statistical analyses.

cue-elicited craving and drinking behavior
analyses were then conducted to determine whether the
groups differed in terms of cue-elicited craving after 2
weeks of treatment and in terms of drinking behavior over
the 12-week trial. these analyses utilized an ‘intent-to-treat’
approach such that all individuals who returned for the
cue reactivity assessment at 2 weeks were included in
the analyses, even if they dropped out of the trial.

placebo group dropped out of the study after the cue

for these individuals the last observation was carried
forward in the analyses, following an intent-to-treat
approach.
to analyze reactivity to alcohol cues, a series of 2  2  2
mixed design analyses of variance (anovas) were
conducted, where cue (control cues vs alcohol cues) was a
two-level within-subjects factor, medication (olanzapine or
placebo) was a two-level between-subjects factor, and  xxxg658xxx 
( xxxg658xxx  l vs  xxxg658xxx  s) was a two-level between-subjects
factor. the craving score at baseline was used as a covariate
to control for the nonspecific effects of olanzapine on
craving.
the analyses revealed a significant medication 

significant  xxxg658xxx   cue interaction, f(1, 59) ¼ 10.29, po0.01.
cue-elicited craving was clearly greater among  xxxg658xxx  l
individuals and olanzapine attenuated craving specifically
among these individuals (see figure 1). there was no
significant main effect of olanzapine on craving (p40.05).
with respect to changes in negative affect, the analyses
revealed a significant medication   xxxg658xxx   cue interaction,
f(1, 59) ¼ 8.11, po0.01, a significant medication  cue

revealed a significant medication   xxxg658xxx   cue interaction
on the tension scale, f(1, 59) ¼ 6.88, po0.05, as well
as a significant main effect for cue and f(1, 59) ¼ 7.91,

 xxxg658xxx  s group and the  xxxg658xxx  l group. analyses indicated that olanzapine
significantly reduced tension during the cue-reactivity paradigm
among  xxxg658xxx  l individuals, but had no effect on  xxxg658xxx  s participants
(po0.01).

drinks also revealed a significant three-way interaction,
f(3, 180) ¼ 5.39, po0.05, indicating that olanzapine significantly reduced the total number of drinks for  xxxg658xxx  l
individuals. similarly, an analysis of percent days abstinent
revealed a trend for a medication   xxxg658xxx  interaction, such
that  xxxg658xxx  l individuals responded more favorably to
olanzapine (p ¼ 0.06).

glucose and ggt data revealed nonsignificant decreases
across the 12-week trial, indicating that olanzapine did not
have any deleterious effects in terms of blood glucose levels
or liver function in this sample. finally, w2 tests were
conducted comparing the medication groups on each of 24
items from the side effect checklist. none of these tests were
significant (p40.10).
all urine samples tested positive for riboflavin, suggesting
that individuals were compliant with the medication
instructions immediately prior to each appointment. in
addition, analyses of the pill count data suggested high
compliance and did not reveal any significant differences in
compliance across the medication   xxxg658xxx  groups. with
respect to the integrity of the medication blind, 63% of the
participants in the olanzapine condition guessed correctly
at the beginning of the experimental session and 65% of the
participants in the placebo condition guessed correctly.
finally, study completion status (completed vs drop-out)
and the integrity of the blind (guess correctly vs did not
guess correctly) were entered as covariates in the analyses

side effects and compliance
finally, analyses were conducted to assess whether side
effects differed across medication groups. anovas were
used to examine change in weight, glucose levels, and ggt
levels before and after the 12-week trial. with respect to
weight gain, a significant medication  time interaction
indicated significant weight gain among individuals treated
with olanzapine as compared to placebo, f(1, 41) ¼ 6.54,
po0.01. the average weight gain in the olanzapine group
was 6.5 lbs at the end of the 12-week trial. there were no
effects for the  xxxg658xxx  on weight gain. analyses of the blood

discussion
the findings of the present study indicate that olanzapine
reduces cue-elicited craving for alcohol and cue-elicited
changes in affect among  xxxg658xxx  l individuals after 2 weeks
of treatment. likewise, olanzapine appears to reduce the
quantity of drinking over the course of a 12-week trial
among  xxxg658xxx  l individuals. the biological mechanism that
underlies the differences in response to olanzapine among
 xxxg658xxx  l and s individuals is not clear. it is possible that the
size of the intracytoplasmic loop may alter g protein
coupling, which in turn may alter the function of the
receptor. future research will need to explore this question.
with respect to side effects, individuals treated with
olanzapine gained approximately 6.5 lbs over the course of
the 12-week study, regardless of their  xxxg658xxx  genotype.
however, there were no other statistically significant group
differences with respect to side effects.
neuropsychopharmacology

in the present study, it is important to note that 5 mg of
olanzapine did not appear to have any beneficial effects
among the  xxxg658xxx  s individuals. the lack of any significant
effects of olanzapine among these individuals is consistent
with a recent report that failed to find any beneficial effects
of olanzapine during the course of a 12-week trial of
olanzapine in an alcohol-dependent sample (guardia et al,
2004). conversely, the finding that olanzapine appears to
attenuate reactivity to alcohol cues as well as drinking in
 xxxg658xxx  l individuals is not consistent with this report. there
are two important differences between the present study
and the previous report, which might explain the different
findings. one of the primary differences is that the study by
guardia et al (2004) did not report results by  xxxg658xxx 
genotype, whereas genotype was considered in the present
study. second, a 10–15 mg dose of olanzapine was used in
the guardia et al study, while 2.5–5 mg was used in the
present study. previous work in our laboratory found that
the 5 mg dose of olanzapine attenuated craving for alcohol.
thus, the difference in findings may be explained in part by
dose response differences and/or dose response by genotype
differences.
the idea that higher doses of olanzapine may be
associated with iatrogenic results is not surprising given
that these doses are likely to produce more severe side
effects, which in turn may lead to reduced compliance and/
or increased drinking as a means of coping with the side
effects. while a dose of 10–20 mg may be beneficial for
individuals suffering from psychosis, these doses may not
be appropriate for other disorders such as alcohol
dependence. even at 2.5–5 mg, olanzapine-treated individuals experienced significant weight gain in the present
study, and, although other side effects observed in the
olanzapine group were not significantly different from the
side effects observed in the placebo group, a greater
percentage of individuals in the olanzapine condition
reported drowsiness. clearly, these side effects may be
more pronounced in a study using higher doses of
olanzapine. in addition, olanzapine targets multiple neurotransmitter systems and the exact mechanism of its effect on
craving and alcohol consumption is not known, although
the  xxxg658xxx   olanzapine interaction is consistent with the
hypothesis that the effect of olanzapine on the dopamine
system is critical. finally, it is possible that the  xxxg658xxx  vntr
may shift the dose–response curve such that  xxxg658xxx  s
individuals might respond favorably to a different dose of
olanzapine (eg a lower dose).
given the potential importance of dosing and the
possibility of a  xxxg658xxx   dose interaction, one of the
limitations of the present study was the lack of a formal
examination of the dose–response curve. higher doses may
produce no positive effects or even iatrogenic effects, while
lower doses may be beneficial. future studies should
examine a 2.5 mg dose as well as a 5 mg dose, and stratify
by genotype such that the hypothesis of a dose  genotype
interaction can be formally tested. it seems possible that
 xxxg658xxx  s individuals may respond to 2.5 mg even if they do
not respond to 5 mg. to determine whether olanzapine will
ultimately be useful in the treatment of alcohol dependence,
future studies also need to examine the long-term effects
of olanzapine on drinking behavior after treatment has
ended.
