abstract: an efficient stereoselective synthesis of the orally active  xxxg2242xxx  antagonist  xxxd203xxx  is
described. a direct condensation of n-benzyl ethanolamine with glyoxylic acid yielded a 2-hydroxy-1,4oxazin-3-one which was activated as the corresponding trifluoroacetate. a lewis acid mediated coupling
with enantiopure (r)-1-(3,5-bis(trifluoromethyl)phenyl)ethan-1-ol afforded a 1:1 mixture of acetal diastereomers which was converted into a single isomer via a novel crystallization-induced asymmetric transformation. the resulting 1,4-oxazin-3-one was converted via a unique and highly stereoselective one-pot
process to the desired r-(fluorophenyl)morpholine derivative. interesting and unexpected [1,2]-wittig and
[1,3]-sigmatropic rearrangements were identified during the optimization of these key steps. in the final
step, a triazolinone side chain was appended to the morpholine core. the targeted clinical candidate was
thus obtained in 55% overall yield over the longest linear sequence.

introduction

the tachykinins,  xxxg2240xxx  (sp),  xxxg2240xxx  (nka), and
 xxxg2241xxx  ( xxxg2241xxx ) are related neuropeptides with a common
c-terminal sequence which are widely distributed in the peripheral and central nervous systems where they act as neurotransmitters and neuromodulators.1 three receptor subtypes have
been confirmed by the cloning of three distinct genes from
various mammalian sources, including man, with sp being the
preferred agonist for the  xxxg2242xxx , nka for the  xxxg2240xxx  receptor and  xxxg2241xxx  for the  xxxg2243xxx .2 the advent of selective
non-peptide nk receptor antagonists has contributed significantly to the understanding of neurokinin receptor pharmacology
and the physiological role of the tachykinins.3 the  xxxg2242xxx

antagonists have received most of the attention and compounds
have been evaluated for a wide variety of important medical
disorders. research at merck has led to the identification of
 xxxd203xxx  (1) as a potent and orally active  xxxg2242xxx  antagonist for clinical evaluation in chemotherapy-induced emesis,4
depression5 and other potential indications. an efficient and
practical synthesis for 1 was clearly needed in support of these
studies.6
compound 1 contains an unusual cis-2-alkoxy-3-arylmorpholine core structure featuring three stereogenic centers in close
proximity. an initial logical disconnection of the strategic acetal
bond in 2 suggested enantiomerically pure 3 and 4 as key
intermediates (scheme 1). however, this glycosidation-type
approach did not prove to be viable. numerous methods for
activation of 3 (lg ) leaving group) in two protecting group
series (p ) bn or boc) together with a large number of solvent
and lewis acid combinations were evaluated with little success.7
in all cases, the stereoselectivity in favor of the desired 2 was

desired diasteromer. crystallization-induced asymmetric transformations9 have been reported in the literature and are most
often based on serendipitous discoveries.10 most of these deal
with salts and other complexes, often of amino acids and their
derivatives.11 transformations of this kind involving covalent
diastereomers are less common. several cases have been reported in which compounds containing a chiral auxiliary, which
must be removed at a later stage, were used.12 this paper will
describe a rare example of a crystallization-induced diastereoselective transformation which was designed to make use of a
stereocenter that is an integral part of the desired target. as a
corollary to this approach, the development of a novel and
efficient conversion of 6 to 2 was also required. the successful
accomplishment of these two goals are at the heart of an efficient
and practical synthesis of  xxxg2242xxx  antagonist 1.
results and discussion

synthesis of n-benzyl lactam  xxxd2437xxx  9. the choice for
protecting group p in scheme 2 was in large part dictated by
the chemistry needed to convert 6 to 2 (scheme 2). this requires
(at least formally) a reduction step. to achieve maximum
efficiency late in the synthesis, we decided to use a benzyl
protecting group hoping that deprotection and reduction could
be achieved in the same step. lactam  xxxd2437xxx  9 could be prepared
in two steps from inexpensive n-benzylethanolamine (scheme
3). condensation of 8 with diethyl oxalate yielded the expected
lactam lactone 10.13,14 lithium tri(sec-butyl)borohydride reduction of the latter afforded 9 in high yield.
the need for an oxidation state adjustment in this approach
was not ideal and a more direct synthesis for 9 was therefore
pursued. the literature suggested that condensation of nbenzylethanolamine (8) with an alkyl glyoxylate or the corresponding hemiacetal could furnish 9 directly.15 however, in our

scheme 2

modest at best. significant amounts of elimination product 5
(p ) bn or boc) were also formed. recently, some of us reported on a synthesis of 1 which uses an intramolecular glycosidation reaction to circumvent these difficulties.8 this paper
will report on the successful implementation of a different
approach.
our analysis is presented in scheme 2. the retrosynthetic
introduction of a lactam carbonyl group was expected to perform
two important functions in this strategy. substitution reactions
at c-2 in 7 with the poorly nucleophilic 4 should be facilitated
and beta-elimination would no longer be possible as a result of
c-3 being sp2 hybridized. high levels of diastereoselectivity
were not anticipated for the coupling between racemic 7 and
enantiopure 4. however, a high-yielding stereoselective transformation could in principle be achieved if conditions were
identified under which 6 and its c-2 epimer were induced to
equilibrate, aided by the neighboring carbonyl group, at a rate
which is competitive with the selective crystallization of the

hands the reaction of 8 with commercially available methyl
2-hydroxy-2-methoxy acetate afforded 9 in a meager 15% yield
after crystallization from a complex reaction mixture. surprisingly, initial attempts to condense 8 with one equivalent of the
less activated glyoxylic acid monohydrate in refluxing thf
provided 9 in 20% yield.16 optimization studies were performed
using 50% aqueous glyoxylic acid solutions (scheme 4).
it was found that condensation of 8 with aqueous glyoxylic
acid occurs readily at ambient temperature to provide 11 in high
yield.17 the latter rearranges to 9 in a refluxing mixture of water
and thf. this reaction appears to be acid-catalyzed since it is
accelerated in the presence of a small excess of glyoxylic acid.
however, nmr studies indicated that decarboxylation of 11 to
oxazolidine 12 is a serious side reaction at higher temperatures.
heating 12 with aqueous glyoxylic acid in thf also provided
9, confirming that the acetal moiety is readily exchanged under
the reaction conditions. these studies suggested that the low
yields in our initial experiments were due to the partial
decarboxylation of glyoxylic acid to formaldehyde via 11 and
that better yields for 9 can be obtained by using an excess of
glyoxylic acid.18 indeed, after heating a solution of 8 with an
optimized 2.3 equivalents of aqueous glyoxylic acid in thf at
reflux and an adjustment of the solvent composition from
predominantly thf to predominantly water,  xxxd543xxx  could
be crystallized directly from the reaction mixture in 76% yield.

synthesis of sec-phenethyl alcohol 4. several options for
the synthesis of enantiomerically pure 3,5-bis(trifluoromethyl)sec-phenethyl alcohol 4 were considered. the catalytic asymmetric (transfer) hydrogenation processes developed by noyori
and co-workers19 were particularly appealing to us. a modification of the ruthenium catalyzed transfer hydrogenation using
(1s, 2r)-cis-amino-2-indanol as the ligand20 attracted our
attention since this compound is readily available at merck.21
commercially available ketone 13 could be reduced to (r)-4 in
91% e.e. and 92% yield under these conditions (scheme 5).
a slightly higher enantioselectivity was obtained after fully
optimizing an oxazaborolidine-catalyzed borane reduction22 of
the ketone. slow addition of 13 to a solution containing 2 mol
% of the (s)-catalyst and 0.6 equiv of bh3‚phnet2 complex in
methyl tert-butyl ether between -10 and 0 °c yielded (r)-4 in
97% yield and 93% e.e. (95% e.e. when 5 mol % of the catalyst
was used). in either case, the enantiopurity of (r)-4 could be
conveniently upgraded to >99% e.e. via a recrystallization.
synthesis of lactam acetal 16. the projected union of
racemic 9 with enantiopure (r)-4 to yield the desired (r,r)-16
via a crystallization-induced diastereoselective transformation
consists of several components: the activation of 9, the
substitution reaction of the resulting product with 4, the
equilibration of the expected products 16 and 17, and the
selective crystallization of 16 from the reaction mixture. each
of these components was first studied separately before they
were brought together to act in concert.
initially,  xxxd2437xxx  9 was activated as an imidate.23,24 stirring 9
with an excess of trichloroacetonitrile and potassium carbonate
in dichloromethane at ambient temperature cleanly yielded 14
(scheme 6). upon completion of the reaction the solids were
filtered, and the filtrate was concentrated to dryness furnishing
14 as an unstable crystalline solid. this compound reacted
instantaneously with 4 after addition of a catalytic amount of
tmsotf to yield a 55:45 mixture of diastereomers 16 and 17
in 90% yield. although this protocol worked quite well on small
scale, it proved difficult to scale.25 invariably, significant
amounts of “dimeric” 1826 were also produced. control experiments confirmed that 14 reacted faster with 9 than with 4. in a

closely related procedure, 9 was reacted with trichloroacetonitrile
in the presence of dbu in a mixture of toluene and heptane
which led to the crystallization of 14 directly from the reaction
mixture. addition of the resulting 14 to a mixture of 4 and a
catalytic amount of bf3‚et2o again gave a 55:45 mixture of
16 and 17 (95% yield). even though the latter process proved
scalable, the isolation and handling of the rather unstable and
moisture sensitive 14 was still quite problematic. consequently,
the potential for alternative and less reactive activation of 9 was
investigated. the glycosyl chloride and bromide (x ) cl, br)
could be prepared from 9 relatively easily under a variety of
conditions but they proved to be rather unstable and gave 16
and 17 in lower overall yield than via the imidate. it was
discovered that several esters of 9 provided sufficient activation
for a reaction with 4 using bf3‚et2o catalysis.27 the acetate of
9 significantly transesterified to 4 which obviously lowered the
yield of the coupling reaction. pivaloate, isobutyrate, and
benzoate esters showed a reduced tendency for transesterification. however, overall yields for activation and coupling with
4 were substantially lower for these esters than for the imidate
(80-85% vs 90-95%). finally, it was found that the trifluoroacetate ester provided excellent activation with minimal transesterification. moreover, 15 could be conveniently prepared in
quantitative yield without the need for a base by simply adding
1.0 equiv of trifluoroacetic anhydride to 9.28 reaction of freshly
prepared 15 with 4 catalyzed by bf3‚et2o followed by a
straightforward aqueous workup yielded the 55:45 mixture of

most practical and scalable.
the surprisingly  xxxd1850xxx  diastereomers 16 and 17 were
obtained in pure form via careful chromatography. although
the desired 16 was a highly crystalline compound (figure 1),
diastereomer 17 turned out to be a significantly lower melting
solid. as hoped, seeding of a typical crude 55:45 mixture of 16

the desired component. obviously, the efficiency of this process
was rather low in the absence of equilibration between 16 and
17. a variety of conditions was therefore probed to determine
if equilibration between the diastereomers could be achieved.
under various lewis or brönsted acidic conditions, 16 and 17
did not interconvert. screening of basic conditions was more
successful (table 1). under the conditions of entries 5 and 7,
equilibration could be discerned. in both cases, the ratio of 16
and 17 changed from the initial 55:45 to 65:35 at equilibrium.29,30 however, the equilibration was accompanied by some
(28) it is critical to add exactly 1.0 equivalent of tfaa to 9 to obtain the
optimum yield. when the anhydride is undercharged with respect to 9 the
yield for the overall process is lowered due to a reaction of 15 with the
unconverted 9 to yield a mixture of isomeric 18 (meso and d/l). conversely,
when the anhydride is overcharged relative to 9 part of 4 is also esterified
which also results in a lower overall yield for the coupling reaction.

decomposition of 16 and 17. the two most significant decomposition products (approximately 3:1 ratio according to hplc
analysis) proved identical to the two most abundant products
generated under aprotic basic conditions (entries 1 and 2 of
table 1). chromatographic purification provided a mixture of
these components from which the major crystallized. upon
dissolution in cdcl3, this major product slowly converted to
the same mixture as before crystallization. the structures of
these compounds were assigned as 19 and 20 (scheme 7) on
the basis of nmr experiments. unfortunately, these experiments
did not allow the assignment of the relative stereochemistry of
the ketal and methyl bearing carbons for the major and minor
isomer with complete confidence. it was established that both
19 and 20 were each a 86:14 mixture of enantiomers.31 the
structure and enantiopurity of these products strongly suggest
that they are formed via an interesting [1,2]-wittig rearrangement.32,33
the impact of the solvent polarity and the base on the
equilibration and decomposition of 16 and 17 was further studied
in a series of experiments which used a minimum amount of
thf in the reaction medium in order to maintain homogeneity
and prevent crystallization-induced effects. the rate of equilibration was significantly faster with potassium than with lithium
tert-butoxide (∼16 h vs >48 h for complete equilibration,
respectively).35 equilibration was much slower with primary
alkoxides (regardless of their counterion). both observations are
probably explained by the increase in basicity in going from
primary to tertiary alkoxides and in going from lithium to
potassium alkoxides.36 during further optimization of the result
in entry 5 (table 1) it was found that the rate of equilibration
increased with increasing amounts of potassium tert-butoxide.
unfortunately, the rate of the [1,2]-wittig rearrangement also
increased with more base, leading to the formation of significant amounts of 19/20 at ambient temperature. however, the
rearrangement reaction can be nearly completely suppressed by
(29) as expected, results starting with a mixture of 16 and 17 or with either
pure 16 or pure 17 were identical under these conditions.
(30) several other n-alkyl analogues of 16/17 were prepared in order to
determine the impact on the equilibrium ratio. derivatives containing
4-phenylbenzyl, benzhydryl, and both enantiomers of r-methylbenzyl at
the lactam nitrogen all equilibrated to an approximate 2:1 mixture of
diastereomers upon subjection to the conditions of entry 5 of table 1.
(31) in the absence of a reference compound, this hplc method did not allow
the assignment of the absolute structure of the major and minor enantiomers.

maintaining the reaction temperature below 0 °c. thus, aging
a solution of 16 in tert-butyl alcohol with 5 equivs of 1.0 m
kotbu/thf at 20 and at 0 °c, respectively, yielded a 65:35
and a 78:22 mixture of 16 and 17 with 11 and <1 area% of
19/20, respectively. crystallization of 16 cannot be achieved
in high yield from heptane solutions which contain even
relatively small amounts of tert-butyl alcohol. thus, it was
necessary to identify a less polar proton donor with an appropiate
pka to lower the solubility of 16 under the equilibration conditions. a survey of readily available lipophilic tertiary alcohols
yielded 3,7-dimethyl-3-octanol (tetrahydrolinalool) as an attractive candidate.37 fortuitously, the equilibration rate was
significantly faster in this alcohol than in tert-butyl alcohol with
equilibrium achieved within 3 as compared to 20 h (2 equivs
of a 1.0 m kotbu in thf solution added to a 0.16 m solution
of 16 in the respective alcohols at 20 °c). we speculate that
the alkoxide anion is a stronger base in the less polar 3,7dimethyl-3-octanol than in the more polar and better solvating
tert-butyl alcohol.38 substituting thf in the above conditions
with heptane and seeding with 16 then led to a practical process
in which the desired diastereomer crystallizes with high recovery
and the undesired diastereomer is continuously epimerized.
additional optimization studies showed that by replacing potassium tert-butoxide with the potassium salt of 3,7-dimethyl-3octanol39 the amounts of base and alcohol could be further
reduced. thus, in the optimum process the crude 55:45 mixture
of 16 and 17 resulting from the glycosidation reaction is
dissolved in heptane and 0.9 equiv of 3,7-dimethyl-3-octanol
are added. the mixture is then cooled to between -10 and -5
°c.40 after seeding with 16 and addition of 0.3 equiv of the
potassium salt of 3,7-dimethyl-3-octanol, the crystallizationdriven epimerization starts. after 5 h, the initial 55:45 mixture
has been transformed into a 96:4 mixture (on a homogenized
basis) from which 16 can be isolated in 83-85% overall yield
(based on 4).41 the enantiopurity of 16 is >99% e.e. the abovedescribed crystallization process is so powerful that starting with
enantiomerically pure 4 is not critical. using 4 of only 91%
e.e. still provided >99% e.e. pure 16 under the above conditions,
albeit with a slightly reduced overall isolated yield (76%; i.e.,
80% when corrected for the enantiopurity of 4).
conversion of oxazinone 16 to morpholine 26. several
options for expedient conversion of n-benzyl lactam 16 to
r-arylamine 26 were considered. the combination of a formal
nucleophilic addition of a 4-fluorophenyl group and a reduction
appeared the most straightforward. however, to the best of our
knowledge there is no literature precedent for achieving this
type of transformation in a relatively small number of steps. it
was expected in the case at hand that the relatively bulky
2-alkoxy group in 16 would direct any reaction to the opposite
face of the molecule. thus, to obtain the desired stereochemistry
it is essential that the nucleophilic addition precedes the
(37) tetrahydrolinanool is available from aldrich at approximately $100 for
500 ml. only the racemic alcohol was used in our experiments. the effect,
if any, of using enantiomerically pure solvent in this process has not been
studied.

(39) the potassium salt of 3,7-dimethyl-3-octanol can be conveniently generated
as a solution in heptane by adding potassium tert-butoxide to a solution of
3,7-dimethyl-3-octanol in heptane and distilling off tert-butyl alcohol.
(40) as expected on the basis of the melting point difference, compound 17 is
considerably more soluble under these conditions than 16 (51 and 25 mg/
ml, respectively).
(41) interestingly, seeding with crystalline 17 leads to an identical endpoint
providing additional evidence that 16 is the thermodynamic product in this
process.

reduction. simultaneous deprotection of the n-benzyl group was
another desired outcome of this process, as mentioned before.
in practice, it was not necessary to activate the lactam moiety
toward nucleophilic addition. lactam 16 reacted readily with
4-fluorophenylmagnesium bromide in a variety of solvents. the
expected adduct 21 was obtained as a 2:1 mixture of diastereomers which are presumably in equilibrium via 22 (scheme
8). the stereochemistry of the major and minor isomers could
not be unequivocally established on the basis of their nmr
spectra. in initial experiments, the grignard addition reaction
was worked-up and the resulting crude product mixture was
hydrogenated in methanol using pearlman’s catalyst. gratifyingly, the desired product was detected by hplc as the main
component in a complex mixture, and amine 26 could be
crystallized as its  xxxd1526xxx  salt in 64% yield (based
on 16) from this mixture.
some of the other reaction products were isolated from the
mother liquors in two fractions via silica gel chromatography.
the more polar fraction contained the amino alcohol 29. the
absolute carbinol stereochemistry in 29, which presumably arises
from 22 via 28, was corroborated as (3s) via chemical correlation with trans morpholine derivative 27.42 the origin of this
remarkable selectivity (the other carbinol epimer was not
detected by hplc analysis in the crude reaction mixture) is
not clear. the less polar fraction of the chromatography

contained two isomeric lactones in a 2:1 ratio according to
hplc and nmr analysis. the relative stereochemistry of both
isomers was secured via single-crystal x-ray analysis43 as 23
and 24, respectively.44 the rearrangement of the 21/22 mixture
to give 23 and 24 can occur under remarkably mild conditions.
for example, concentration of a solution containing 21 and 22
to dryness under high vacuum at ambient temperature led to
complete conversion to 23 and 24. presumably, 21 and 22 can
readily generate iminium intermediate 33 which upon proton
loss converts to enamine 34. the latter can then undergo a [1,3]sigmatropic rearrangement (scheme 9).45,46
formation of 23 and 24 from 21/22 during the workup of
the grignard reaction and the hydrogenation obviously limited
the efficiency of our first-generation process. consequently, the
isolation of the labile 21/22 was abandoned and a more robust
one-pot process was developed. when the crude grignard
(43) the crystals of 23 used for this analysis were grown from the sio2chromatographed material and shown to be a single enantiomer via chiral
stationary phase chromatography. the crystals of 24 were grown from
material purified after treating 21 with acid and these were racemic
according to chiral stationary phase chromatography. crystallographic
details and ortep plots for each isomer are provided in the supporting
information section.
(44) we were able to determine via chiral stationary phase chromatography that
23 and 24 were each >95% e.e. pure. however, at this point we cannot
assign an absolute configuration for 23 and 24 with certainty. thermal

mixture was quenched into methanol and then hydrogenated in
the presence of a pd/c catalyst a 1.7:1 mixture of 26 and 29,
respectively (area ratio by hplc), was formed in a relatively
slow reaction. the formation of 23 and 24 was insignificant
under these conditions (<1%). in a key experiment, it was found
that the hydrogenation selectivity in favor of the desired 26
increased dramatically when the quenched grignard reaction
mixture was acidified before the hydrogenation was performed.
additional studies showed that the nature and amount (i.e.,
relative to the amount of grignard reagent) of the acid are
critically important in achieving optimum reaction performance.
a highly optimized protocol was eventually developed in which
16 was first allowed to react with 1.3 equivs of 4-fluorophenylmagnesium bromide in thf at ambient temperature. the
resulting solution was then quenched with methanol and 1.82.2 equivs of  xxxd1526xxx  were added. immediate
hydrogenation at ambient temperature in the presence of 5%
pd/c yielded crude 26 in excellent yield. kinetic studies of the
hydrogenation reaction47 showed that cyclic imine 25 is an
important intermediate. the stereoselectivity in the reduction
of 25 is typically >300:1. it is interesting to note that continued
hydrogenation does not result in the reduction of any of the
other benzylic bonds in 26. morpholine derivative 26 can be
isolated from the reaction mixture as its hydrochloride salt in
91% overall yield (based on 16), indicating that both the
grignard addition and the reduction occur in near quantitative
yield. this process was successfully used to prepare multikilogram batches of 26‚hcl at a time.
(47) details of these kinetic studies will be reported separately.

conversion of morpholine 26 to  xxxd203xxx  (1). conversion of 26‚hcl to  xxxd203xxx  is rather straightforward (scheme
10). alkylation of 26‚hcl in the presence of a base with chloro
amidrazone 30, which can be easily synthesized from chloroacetonitrile,48 yields intermediate 31 in high yield. thermolysis
of the latter in toluene results in triazolinone formation and the
desired 1 can be isolated in 85% overall yield. alternatively,
26‚hcl can be alkylated with chloromethyltriazolinone 32 to
afford 1 directly.49
conclusions

the  xxxg2242xxx  antagonist 1 was convergently synthesized
in 55% overall yield over the longest linear sequence. a novel
crystallization-induced diastereoselective glycosidation as well
as an unprecedented stereoselective one-pot transformation of
an 1,4-oxazin-3-one into a 3-(4-fluorophenyl)morpholine derivative serve as the foundation for this practical and exceedingly
efficient approach. furthermore, unexpected and interesting
[1,2]-wittig and [1,3]-sigmatropic rearrangements were also
identified.
