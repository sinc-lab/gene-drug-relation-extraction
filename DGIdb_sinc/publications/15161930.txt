estrogen receptors er␣ and er␤ ( xxxg730xxx  and -2) (2, 3). because of the high conservation in the dna binding domain,
errs and ers have overlapping dna binding selectivity (4 – 6)
and, accordingly, may co-regulate target genes in tissues in
which they are co-expressed. err subfamily members have for
example been shown to modulate the expression of er target
genes in bone (7, 8) or breast tissue (9, 10). importantly, overexpression of err␣ and err␥ in samples from breast cancer
patients correlates with unfavorable and favorable biomarkers,
respectively (11). therefore, these receptors might serve as
prognostic markers themselves or even be targets for endocrine
therapy in human breast cancer.
despite their significant homology with ers in the ligand
binding domain (lbd), errs do not (or only very weakly)
respond to estradiol (e2) (2, 12). furthermore, whereas ers
are ligand-activated receptors, errs are constitutively active
(13–16), and a structural study confirmed that the err␥ lbd
can adopt a transcriptionally active conformation and interact
with the  xxxg1510xxx  ( xxxg1510xxx ) in the absence of
any ligand (12). together, these observations suggest that
errs are ligand-independent activators of transcription whose
activation potential may rather be determined by the presence
of transcriptional coactivators (17–20).
although natural err agonists may not exist, putative endogenous ligands were predicted to act as antagonists due to the
specific architecture of the ligand binding pocket (lbp) observed
for the err␥ apolbd (12). although no natural ligand is known
to date, the er agonist diethylstilbestrol (des) and the selective
er modulator (serm) 4- xxxd91xxx  (4- xxxd3285xxx ) have been
identified as err antagonists (21–23). des deactivates all three
isotypes, whereas 4- xxxd3285xxx  binds only to err␤ and err␥. in
contrast, the serm raloxifene (ral) does not bind to errs (23)
(summarized in table i). the activity of err␣ is also antagonized by the organochlorine pesticides chlordane and toxaphene
(24), but binding of these substances to err␣ remains unclear
(21). in contradiction to structure-based predictions (12), a recent
study identified flavone and isoflavone phytoestrogens as err
agonists (25), although binding of these substances to the receptors has not been demonstrated.
nuclear receptor lbds adopt a canonical antiparallel ␣-helical sandwich fold generally composed of 12 ␣-helices (h1- xxxg1956xxx )
and a small ␤-sheet (26, 27). agonist ligands trigger the lbd
activation function (termed af2) by stabilizing a defined conformation in which  xxxg1956xxx  packs against the lbd body and together with h3 and h4 generates a hydrophobic coactivator
binding surface. coactivators typically bind via lxxll sequence motifs (l denotes leucine, and x denotes any amino
acid) that form amphiphatic ␣-helices. antagonist ligands interfere with the formation of an active lbd conformation and
coactivator recruitment. in most documented cases af2 antag-

the estrogen-related receptor (err) ␥ behaves as a
constitutive activator of transcription. although no natural ligand is known, err␥ is deactivated by the  xxxg730xxx  (er) agonist diethylstilbestrol and the selective er modulator 4- xxxd91xxx  but does not
significantly respond to estradiol or raloxifene. here we
report the crystal structures of the err␥ ligand binding
domain (lbd) complexed with diethylstilbestrol or 4- xxxd91xxx . antagonist binding to err␥ results in
a rotation of the side chain of phe-435 that partially fills
the cavity of the apolbd. the new rotamer of phe-435
displaces the “activation helix” (helix 12) from the agonist position observed in the absence of ligand. in contrast to the complexes of the er␣ lbd with 4- xxxd91xxx  or raloxifene, helix 12 of antagonist-bound
err␥ does not occupy the coactivator groove but appears to be completely dissociated from the lbd body.
comparison of the ligand-bound lbds of err␥ and er␣
reveals small but significant differences in the architecture of the ligand binding pockets that result in a
slightly shifted binding position of diethylstilbestrol
and a small rotation of 4- xxxd91xxx  in the cavity
of err␥ relative to er␣. our results provide detailed
molecular insight into the conformational changes occurring upon binding of synthetic antagonists to the
constitutive orphan receptor err␥ and reveal structural differences with ers that explain why err␥ does
not bind estradiol or raloxifene and will help to design
new selective antagonists.

experimental procedures

protein production and purification—the hexahistidine-tagged murine err␥ lbd (residues 229 – 458) was produced from a pet-15b
expression vector (novagen) in escherichia coli bl21(de3) at 37 °c.
after sonication of the bacterial pellet and ultracentrifugation, the
recombinant protein was first purified by cobalt affinity chromatography (talon, clontech). affinity chromatography was carried out in a
batch at room temperature in buffer a (20 mm tris-hcl (ph 8.0), 50 mm
nacl). after 3 washes of the talon resin with buffer a containing 5
mm imidazole (ph 8.0), the hexahistidine-tagged err␥ lbd was eluted
by increasing the imidazole concentration to 200 mm. the protein was
further purified by gel filtration using a hiload 16/60 superdex 200
column (amersham biosciences) on a biologic work station (bio-rad).

the lbd homodimer eluted in buffer a from the gel filtration column at
the expected position as a single peak. the fractions containing purified
protein (estimated purity ⬎95%) were pooled and concentrated to about
8 mg/ml.
protein complex crystallization, data collection, and processing—
co-crystallization with a 2-fold molar excess of des or 4- xxxd3285xxx  (sigma)
was carried out with the hanging drop or the sitting drop vapor diffusion method (hanging drop: 2 ␮l of protein solution plus 2 ␮l of reservoir
against 500 ␮l of reservoir in 24-well vdx plates (hampton research);
sitting drop: 1 ␮l of protein solution plus 1 ␮l of reservoir against 200 ␮l
of reservoir in 96-well crystalquicktm plates (greiner)). for the err␥
lbd䡠des and one of the err␥ lbd䡠4- xxxd3285xxx  complexes, the peg/ion
screen (hampton research) allowed identification of preliminary crystallization conditions. a second crystal form for the err␥ lbd䡠4- xxxd3285xxx 
complex was found upon screening with the crystal screen ii (hampton
research). in the refined conditions, err␥ lbd䡠des crystals grew in
sitting drops within a few days at 24 °c with a reservoir containing 0.1
m tris-hcl (ph 8.0), 0.1 m sodium acetate, 18% peg3350 (cryo conditions: 0.1 m tris-hcl (ph 8.0), 0.1 m sodium acetate, 20% peg3350, 20%
ethylene glycol). err␥ lbd䡠4- xxxd3285xxx  crystals (crystal form 1) were obtained in hanging drops at 4 °c with a reservoir containing 0.1 m mes
(ph 6.5), 1.6 m  xxxd2534xxx  (cryo conditions: 0.1 m mes (ph 6.5), 1.6 m
 xxxd2534xxx , 13% ethylene glycol). err␥ lbd䡠4- xxxd3285xxx  crystals of form 2 grew
in hanging drops at 24 °c in reservoir containing 0.1 m tris-hcl (ph
8.0), 0.2 m  xxxd2534xxx , 14% peg3350 (cryo conditions: 0.1 m tris-hcl (ph
8.0), 0.1 m  xxxd2534xxx , 20% peg3350, 20% ethylene glycol). new crystals of
the err␥ apolbd grew in the presence of a 3-fold molar excess of a
 xxxg1510xxx  coactivator peptide (686rhkilhrllqegsps700) (12) at 4 °c in
hanging drops with a reservoir containing 100 mm tris-hcl (ph 8.5),
1.6 m (nh4)2so4, 20% glycerol (the mother liquor served as cryoprotectant). x-ray diffraction data were collected at the id14 –1, the
id14 –2, or the bm30 beam line at the european synchrotron radiation
facility in grenoble, france. the data were integrated and scaled using
the hkl2000 package (34).
structure determination, refinement, and comparison—the crystal
structures of the err␥ lbd䡠des and the err␥ lbd䡠4- xxxd3285xxx  complexes
were solved by molecular replacement with amore (35) using the
c-terminal-deleted err␥ lbd homodimer (amino acids 235– 440) (12)
as the search model. the structures were refined at the indicated
resolution (table ii) using cns (36) and programs of the ccp4 package
(37– 40). manual adjustments and rebuilding of the models were performed using the program o (41). the final models were validated with
procheck (42). data collection and structure refinement statistics
are summarized in table ii. for structure comparisons, the c␣ traces of
the models were superimposed from h3 (leu-265 in err␥; met-343 in
er␣) to the middle of h11 (phe-435 in err␥; leu-525 in er␣) using the
lsq commands of o and default parameters. the probe-occupied volume
of the err␥ lbp in the absence and presence of ligand was calculated
with voidoo (43). the figures were generated with dino.2
results

overall structure of the antagonist-bound err␥ lbd—we
solved the crystal structures of the err␥ lbd in complex with
des (at 2.1 å of resolution, space group p21) and with 4- xxxd3285xxx 
(crystal form 1 at 2.2 å resolution, space group p4322; crystal
form 2 at 3.2 å resolution, space group p3221) (table ii). in
addition, we further refined the structure of the err␥ apolbd
bound to a  xxxg1510xxx  peptide (12) at 2.4 å of resolution (space
group p43212). in all cases, the err␥ lbd crystallized in
homodimeric form; thus, ligand binding does not interfere with
homodimer formation.

onism is based on steric interference between a bulky ligand
extension protruding from the lbp and  xxxg1956xxx  in the agonist
position, as exemplified by the er␣ lbd bound to ral or
4- xxxd3285xxx  (28, 29) or the er␤ lbd complexed with  xxxd576xxx 
(ici) (30). alternatively, “small” antagonists without bulky
extension can destabilize the active lbd conformation by promoting nonproductive interactions between  xxxg1956xxx  and the lbd
body, as exemplified by the action of 5,11-cis-diethyl-5,6,11,12tetrahydrochrysene-2,8-diol (r,r enantiomer) on er␤ (31).
in crystallographic and recent fluorescence studies it has
been attempted to more precisely correlate the conformation of
the antagonist-bound er lbd with the distinct biological activities elicited by serms (ral, 4- xxxd3285xxx ) or full er antagonists
(ici compounds) in vivo (28 –30, 32). in the crystallized complexes of the er␣ lbd with ral or 4- xxxd3285xxx  a partial unfolding
of the c-terminal end of h11 and structural adaptations of the
h11/ xxxg1956xxx  loop were observed, allowing  xxxg1956xxx  to bind to the coactivator groove (28, 29). in contrast, in the er␤ lbd䡠ici
complex  xxxg1956xxx  is not visible due to high mobility, since the
terminal amide moiety of the ligand sterically precludes its
packing against the coactivator groove (30). in turn, a high  xxxg1956xxx 
mobility appears to result in an increased cellular er turnover,
accounting in part for the full antagonist activity of ici compounds (30, 33). fluorescence studies confirmed a partial unfolding of the c terminus of h11 in er␣ lbd-antagonist complexes in solution (32). interestingly, full antagonists seem to
have a lower h11 unfolding potential than serms, and subtle
differences were observed between the spectroscopic signatures
of ral and 4- xxxd3285xxx .
in contrast to ers, nothing is known about ligand-induced
conformational changes of err lbds. here we report the
crystal structures of the err␥ lbd䡠des complex (at 2.1 å
resolution) and of two err␥ lbd䡠4- xxxd3285xxx  complexes (at 2.2 and
3.2 å resolution). superimposition of the antagonist-bound
structures with the err␥ apolbd (refined to 2.4 å resolution)
in the transcriptionally active conformation establishes the
conformational changes occurring upon des or 4- xxxd3285xxx  binding.
comparison of the err␥ lbd-antagonist complexes with the
er␣ lbd bound to various ligands (e2, des, 4- xxxd3285xxx , ral)
reveals differences in the architecture of the lbps of er␣ and
err␥ that do not permit efficient binding of e2 or ral to
err␥. finally, our results suggest that (unlike observed in the
complexes of the er␣ lbd with ral and 4- xxxd3285xxx ) a highly
mobile  xxxg1956xxx  interferes with the recruitment of coactivators to
antagonist-bound err␥.

comparison of the err␥ apolbd with the des and 4- xxxd3285xxx 
complexes revealed no major conformational changes for the
main chain atoms from h1 to the middle of h11 (data not
shown). some changes of the main chain include adaptations of
the h1-h3 loop, which mainly result from crystal packing. in
contrast, important structural perturbations of the main chain
due to 4- xxxd3285xxx  or des binding affect the c terminus of h11, the
h11/ xxxg1956xxx  loop, and  xxxg1956xxx  (table iii). first, in the ligand-bound
complexes, the c terminus of h11 is slightly bent away from
the entrance of the lbp due to space requirements of the
ligand. second, in some subunits of the err␥ lbd䡠4- xxxd3285xxx  (but
not the err␥ lbd䡠des) complexes present in the asymmetric
unit (au) the c-terminal end of h11 is unfolded. in contrast to
er␣ lbd䡠serm complexes (28, 29), partial h11 unfolding is
not consistently observed in the err␥ lbd䡠4- xxxd3285xxx  complexes
but is only found in one subunit in both crystal forms. finally,
in all ligand-bound complexes the  xxxg1956xxx  region adopts distinct
conformations or is found in different positions. the h11/ xxxg1956xxx 
loop adapts to the constraints imposed by the exact position
and conformation of h11 and  xxxg1956xxx  (table iii).
in contrast to the complexes of the er␣ lbd with ral and
4- xxxd3285xxx  (28, 29), in none of the err␥ lbd-antagonist complexes
does  xxxg1956xxx  pack against the coactivator groove of its respective
lbd body.  xxxg1956xxx  is not visible, most likely due to high mobility
in the case of the err␥ lbd䡠4- xxxd3285xxx  complex (crystal form 2),
and interacts with the coactivator groove of a neighboring
molecule in crystal form 1. for subunits a and b, found in the
au of crystal form 1, this interaction requires different conformational adaptations of the h11/ xxxg1956xxx  loop and the n terminus

of the  xxxg1956xxx  region (fig. 1a). in the err␥ lbd䡠des complex, the
 xxxg1956xxx  region is not visible or is unfolded in three of four molecules (subunits a-c).  xxxg1956xxx  of the fourth molecule (subunit d) is
stabilized through crystal contacts in a position that resembles
the agonist conformation found in the err␥ apolbd䡠src-1
complex (fig. 1b). however, in this “agonist-like” position,  xxxg1956xxx 
of subunit d is shifted by one residue along the ␣-helical axis
with respect to the agonist  xxxg1956xxx  position in the err␥
apolbd䡠src-1 complex. as a consequence the conformation of
the h11/ xxxg1956xxx  loop is completely changed, and  xxxg1956xxx  occupies a
position that in solution is most likely not stabilized by favorable contacts. together, these observations suggest that in
solution des or 4- xxxd3285xxx  binding strongly increases the mobility
of  xxxg1956xxx , whose conformation and position in the crystals is
apparently determined by packing interactions.
mechanism of des- and 4- xxxd3285xxx -mediated antagonism—because of size limitations, des or 4- xxxd3285xxx  cannot bind inside the
small err␥ lbp (⬃220 å3) observed in the apolbd (12).
consequently, des binding induces structural adaptations
that enlarge the volume of the err␥ lbp to about 330 å3. the
4- xxxd3285xxx  binding niche differs from the des cavity mainly
around the amine moiety, which extends onto the protein surface. the most prominent conformational change inside the
lbp in response to des and 4- xxxd3285xxx  binding is a rotation of the
side chain of phe-435 (h11), which mostly accounts for the
increase in cavity volume (fig. 2). the new rotamer of phe-435
would sterically clash with  xxxg1956xxx  in the agonist position, notably
with the side chain of leu-454 in  xxxg1956xxx  (fig. 2a). thus, the desor 4- xxxd3285xxx -induced rotation of the side chain of phe-435 pre-

val-313, arg-316), the ␤-sheet (tyr-326), h7 (leu-342, leu345, asn346, ile-349), and h11 (ala-431, his-434, phe-435)
(fig. 2 and data not shown). the “anti-estrogenic” amine moiety of 4- xxxd3285xxx  forms additional contacts with trp-305 and phe435 (data not shown). furthermore, the side chain of asp-273
(h3) on the err␥ lbd surface reorients to form a hydrogen
bond with the tertiary amine group of 4- xxxd3285xxx  (fig. 2b), which
has also been observed with asp-351 in the er␣ lbd䡠4- xxxd3285xxx 
complex (see fig. 3b) (29). as in the corresponding er␣ complexes (29), des and 4- xxxd3285xxx  are anchored on one side of the
lbp by hydrogen bonds with glu-275 (h3) and arg-316 (h5),
while des forms another hydrogen bond with his-434 (h11) on
the other side of the cavity. importantly, the side chain of
glu-275, whose position is not well defined in the err␥
apolbd due to high mobility, reorients toward the ligand and
is tightly positioned in the des and the 4- xxxd3285xxx  complexes. in
comparison, arg-316 and his-434 only slightly reorient upon

ligand binding. other small structural changes inside the lbp
relative to the apolbd concern the side chains of tyr-326
(␤-sheet) and asn-346 (h7) interacting through a hydrogen
bond, which adapt to space requirements of the ligand. superimposition of the des and 4- xxxd3285xxx  complexes of the err␥ lbd
shows that neither the aromatic a ring nor the a ring of des
superimpose exactly with the corresponding a or b ring of
4- xxxd3285xxx  (fig. 2b). this observation reveals a small degree of
variability, by which different types of ligands can use the
available space inside the err␥ lbp.
comparison with er␣ and determinants of ligand binding
selectivity—structure superimposition reveals an overall similar mode of des binding to err␥ and er␣, the major principal difference between the complexes being a canonical agonist
 xxxg1956xxx  position in the case of er␣ but various antagonist  xxxg1956xxx 
conformations in the case of err␥ (fig. 3〈). des binding does
not interfere with the agonist  xxxg1956xxx  position in er␣ because the
side chain of leu-525 (corresponding to phe-435 in err␥)
leaves enough space to accommodate the ligand without a large
conformational change. interestingly, the binding position of
des is slightly shifted by about 0.5 å in the err␥ relative to
the er␣ cavity. this shift could result from differences in the
relative positions of individual ␣-helices and, thus, the exact
topology of the lbps. of the secondary structure elements that
contribute to the cavity, h3, h5, and the ␤-sheet superimpose
well with only minor positional deviations. in contrast, significant shifts of 1.0 –1.5 å along the helix axis are observed for h7
and h11 of err␥ (fig. 3, a and b). both shifts restrict the
available space in the err␥ lbp, which may be the cause of
the slightly altered des binding position.
importantly, compared with des, the 4- xxxd3285xxx  binding position differs more significantly in the lbps of er␣ and err␥
(fig. 3b). although the overall binding mode is conserved and
the aromatic ligand a ring and surrounding parts of the lbp
superimpose relatively well in both complexes, the 4- xxxd3285xxx  binding positions differ for the b ring and the amine moiety. steric
constraints imposed by leu-345 (h7) and phe-435 (h11) in
err␥ (corresponding to ile-424 and leu-525 in er␣, respectively) lead to a small rotation of the 4- xxxd3285xxx  molecule around
c1 in the aromatic a ring. a 4- xxxd3285xxx  binding position in the lbp
of err␥, as observed in er␣, would result in too close contacts
with leu-345 (⬃3 å) and phe-435 (⬃2.8 å).
these differences in the architecture of the lbps of err␥ and
er␣ provide a good explanation why e2 and ral do not bind to
err␥ with significant affinity. superimposition of er␣ lbds in
complex with different ligands shows that e2 and ral protrude
deeper into the lbp toward ile-424 than 4- xxxd3285xxx  (fig. 3, b and c),
resulting in conformational adaptations including distinct side
chain conformations of ile-424 (h7) (28, 29). in contrast, it ap-

are most likely of no physiological relevance.

pears that despite the dynamic behavior of proteins, the space
restrictions in the cavity of err␥ imposed by the shifted position
of h7 cannot be compensated in an energetically favorable manner by a conformational change of the side chain of leu-345.
thus, the altered position of h7 and the presence of leu-345 in
err␥ (replacing ile-424 in er␣) seem to account mostly for the
lack of e2 or ral binding to this receptor.
in one of the err␥ lbd䡠4- xxxd3285xxx  complexes the packing of
 xxxg1956xxx  against the coactivator groove of a neighboring molecule
is determined by a fortuitously co-crystallized bile acid molecule—finally, we compared the  xxxg1956xxx /coactivator groove interactions in the 4- xxxd3285xxx  complexes of err␥ (crystal form 1) and
er␣. in er␣  xxxg1956xxx  packs tightly against its respective lbd body
and mimics coactivator binding by inserting leu-536 and leu540 into the coactivator cleft (29). in contrast, in err␥ the
interaction of  xxxg1956xxx  with the lbd body of a neighboring molecule is determined by the presence of a fortuitously co-crystallized molecule. during refinement the clearly contoured, additional electron density allowed us to identify this molecule as
 xxxd1685xxx  (or a closely related bile acid) (fig. 4a). the bile acid
is bound close to the entrance of the lbp within the proximity
of the protruding amine moiety of 4- xxxd3285xxx  (shortest distance
⬃3.2 å) and occupies together with the c-terminal portion of
 xxxg1956xxx  the hydrophobic coactivator groove (fig. 4b). comparison
of both err␥ subunits present within the au shows that most
regions including h3,  xxxd1685xxx , and the c-terminal part of
 xxxg1956xxx  superimpose well, whereas the h11/ xxxg1956xxx  loop and the n
terminus of  xxxg1956xxx  adopt distinct folds due to different relative
 xxxg1956xxx  positions (fig. 1a and data not shown). in the middle of
 xxxg1956xxx , phe-450 of err␥ interacts with the coactivator cleft in a
roughly similar manner as leu-540, the corresponding residue
in er␣ (fig. 4b). packing of the n-terminal portion of the
err␥  xxxg1956xxx  against the coactivator cleft of a neighboring mole-

cule, however, is precluded by the presence of the  xxxd1685xxx 
molecule and determined by the distinct conformations of the
h11/ xxxg1956xxx  loop in both err␥ subunits. consequently, met-446
of err␥ does not form an interaction equivalent to that of the
corresponding leu-536 in er␣.
discussion

mechanism of err␥ deactivation—in this study we compare
the crystal structures of the err␥ lbd bound to the antagonists des or 4- xxxd3285xxx  with the apolbd in the transcriptionally
active conformation. our comparisons establish that des- and
4- xxxd3285xxx -mediated antagonism is based on the rotation of the
side chain of phe-435, which upon ligand binding flips out of
the lbp and sterically interferes with  xxxg1956xxx  in the agonist
position. as a consequence,  xxxg1956xxx  is dissociated from the lbd
body, and coactivator binding is impaired. these ideas are in
agreement with previous results showing that mutation of
phe-435 to leucine (the corresponding residue in er) abolishes
the antagonist action of des on err␥ in functional assays (12).
because 4- xxxd3285xxx  binding also requires a rotation of the side
chain of phe-435, the ligand amine moiety protruding from the
lbp is not primarily responsible for the antagonist action of
4- xxxd3285xxx  on err␥.
antagonist ligand effects on err␥ and ers—af2 antagonists of ers have been classified as “active” if a bulky ligand
extension interferes with the agonist  xxxg1956xxx  position (ral,
4- xxxd3285xxx , ici) and as “passive” in the case of small ligands
(5,11-cis-diethyl-5,6,11,12-tetrahydrochrysene-2,8-diol) (28 –
31). deactivation of err␥ by des (a ligand without bulky
extension) provides a particular case of “active” antagonism, in
which a small ligand acts as antagonist by inducing the rotation of the side chain of a single residue (phe-435) inside the
lbp.

the coactivator cleft of the respective lbd
body with leu-536 and leu-540, mimicking lxxll coactivator interactions. in
the err␥ lbd䡠4- xxxd3285xxx  complex (subunit
b in crystal form 1),  xxxg1956xxx  interacts with
the coactivator groove of a neighboring
molecule. binding is distinct from that in
er␣ due to the absence of a lxxll motif
in  xxxg1956xxx  of err␥. the alternative packing
interactions between  xxxg1956xxx  and the coactivator groove, rather, are determined by
the fortuitously co-crystallized  xxxd1685xxx 
molecule that occupies part of the cleft.

in an attempt to correlate antagonist-induced conformational changes of the er lbd with ligand activities in vivo,
af2 antagonists with bulky extension have been further subclassified according to their h11 “unfolding potential” and their
potential to increase the mobility of  xxxg1956xxx  or to promote  xxxg1956xxx 
packing against the coactivator cleft (28 –30, 32). although
most observations from structural and fluorescent studies appear consistent, questions remain about the dynamic behavior
of  xxxg1956xxx  in solution, since the packing of  xxxg1956xxx  against the coactivator cleft observed in the crystal structures of the er␣ lbd
with ral and 4- xxxd3285xxx  may be due to the crystallization conditions. in fact, to our knowledge the dynamic behavior of  xxxg1956xxx  of
er in the presence of serms or full antagonists has never been
comparatively analyzed in fluorescence anisotropy experiments as previously applied for the wild-type or mutant perox-

isome proliferator-activated receptor ␥ lbd (45).
similarly, the effects of ligand binding on the conformation of
the err␥ lbd and the dynamic behavior of  xxxg1956xxx  have not been
addressed in fluorescence studies. in the absence of such data,
the presented crystal structures allow first insight into the
conformational changes induced by des and 4- xxxd3285xxx . most
parts of the err␥ lbd (h1 to the middle of h11) do not
undergo significant conformational changes upon antagonist
binding. structural adaptations affect the c-terminal part of
h11, which slightly bends away from the entrance of the lbp
due to space requirements of the ligand but only unfolds in
individual subunits within the au of the err␥ lbd䡠4- xxxd3285xxx 
complexes. interestingly, des and 4- xxxd3285xxx  may have distinct
unfolding potentials, since we do not observe partial h11 unfolding in the des complexes. binding of both antagonists,

selected parts of the err␥ lbd䡠des complex (green) with the er␣ lbd䡠des complex (red) (pdb code  xxxd1880xxx ). although the
overall ligand binding mode is very similar in both complexes, the des binding
position is shifted by about 0.5 å in the
cavity of err␥ relative to er␣. in contrast to err␥,  xxxg1956xxx  of the er␣ lbd can
occupy the agonist position since there is
no steric clash with leu-525 (corresponding to phe-435 in err␥). b, superimposition of selected parts of the err␥ lbd䡠4oht complex (orange) with the er␣
lbd䡠4- xxxd3285xxx  complex (blue) (pdb code

moiety. the altered 4- xxxd3285xxx  binding results from steric constraints imposed by
leu-345 (ile-424 in er␣), a slightly
shifted relative position of h7, and the
side chain of phe-435 (leu-525 in er␣).

than 4- xxxd3285xxx  and do not bind to err␥ due
to insufficient space in the lbp.

cannot occur in an energetically favorable manner, thus precluding e2 or ral binding. these ideas are supported by
previous results showing significant binding of e2 to the mutants err␥ lbd(l345i) and err␥ lbd(l345i/f435l) in nondenaturing mass spectrometry analysis (12). together, our observations suggest that synthetic estrogens, which as ral
deeply protrude into the er lbp toward ile-424, are unlikely
to bind to err␥ (or other err isotypes), whereas synthetic
estrogens like 4- xxxd3285xxx , which do not completely fill the space
around ile-424, are also potential err ligands.
in a recent study suetsugi et al. (25) identified certain flavone and isoflavone phytoestrogens as err agonists, albeit
without demonstrating their binding to err lbds. the authors used a model of the err␣ lbd based on the agonistbound er␣ lbd to predict the presence of a lbp that can
accommodate flavone or isoflavone ligands without interfering
with the agonist conformation. our superimposition of the antagonist-bound err␥ lbds with the er␤ lbd-genistein complex (52) indicates a possible steric interference between the
side chain of leu-345 of err␥ and o4 (⬃2.2 å), c3 (⬃3 å), and
c4 (⬃2.9 å) of genistein (data not shown). in comparison, small
adaptations of the lbp might permit the binding of daidzein,
which lacks the hydroxyl group on c4 of genistein. however,
superimposition with the err␥ apolbd clearly predicts daidzein or related molecules to act like des and 4- xxxd3285xxx  as antagonists. because our models of the err␣ and the err␤ lbd,
which are based on the err␥ rather than the more distantly
related er␣ lbd, suggest an overall very similar architecture
of the lbps (data not shown), our prediction is valid for all err
isotypes. structure determination of the apo and ligand-bound
lbd of err␣ and err␤ will eventually clarify this issue.
assuming that the overall architecture of the lbp is conserved among errs, the err␥ lbd crystal structures provide
a good starting point to attempt the design of isotype-selective
antagonists. an important discriminative feature between the
lbps of err␤ and err␥ are tyr-326 (␤-sheet) and asn-346
(h7), which form a hydrogen bond in err␥. in err␤ these
residues correspond to tyr-301 and tyr-321, respectively. the
different size and hydrogen-bonding properties of asn-346
(err␥) and tyr-321 (err␤) could be essential in the design of
err␤- or err␥-selective ligands. in err␣ the corresponding
residues are phe-382 and gly-402, respectively. especially, the
small residue gly402 may allow modification of ligands such
that the additionally available space is filled, possibly resulting
in higher affinity and err␣ selectivity.
our err␣ lbd model suggests that the receptor does not bind
4- xxxd3285xxx  due to the side chain of phe-328 (h3), corresponding to
ala-247 in err␤ and ala-272 in err␥ (12). phe-328 (h3) and
phe-495 (h11; corresponding to phe-435 in err␥) are predicted
to almost completely fill the err␣ lbp. in agreement with this
model, err␣ binds 4- xxxd3285xxx  upon mutation of phe-328 to alanine
(23), whereas an err␥ (a272f) mutant no longer responds to
4- xxxd3285xxx  (12). because the err␣ cavity appears to be filled, dramatic conformational changes may occur upon the binding of
des. this idea is interesting with respect to the recently published lbd crystal structures of nurr1 (53) and dhr38 (the
drosophila homologue of ngfi-b) (54), in which the lbp is
completely filled with four aromatic residues conserved within
the ngfi-b subfamily. the authors propose that these orphan
receptors are unlikely to be ligand-regulated since no apparent
conformational changes of the aromatic residues could open a
cavity. however, given the dramatic conformational changes that
may occur upon the binding of des to err␣ and the high
adaptability observed for the lbps of  xxxg1598xxx  (55) and ecr (44), it is
tempting to speculate that (synthetic) ligands might be identified
for members of the ngfi-b subfamily.

however, dissociates the  xxxg1956xxx  region from the lbd body. the
 xxxg1956xxx  positions and conformations observed in the different complexes seem to be random and dictated by crystallization conditions or crystal packing rather than correlate with ligand
characteristics. notably, unlike that observed for the er␣
lbd䡠4- xxxd3285xxx  complex (29),  xxxg1956xxx  does not pack against the coactivator cleft of its respective lbd body in the err␥ lbd䡠4oht complexes. because the length of the h11/ xxxg1956xxx  region is
identical in both receptors, differences in the amino acid sequence may explain this observation.  xxxg1956xxx  of er␣ contains an
lxxll “coactivator” motif, of which leu-536 and leu-540 mediate the anchoring of  xxxg1956xxx  in the coactivator cleft in the ral
and the 4- xxxd3285xxx  complex (28, 29). in contrast, no lxxll motif
is present in  xxxg1956xxx  of err␥, and the corresponding residues
(met-446 and phe-450, respectively) may not allow efficient
interactions of  xxxg1956xxx  with the coactivator groove. therefore, the
dissociation of  xxxg1956xxx  from the lbd body upon des or 4- xxxd3285xxx 
binding to err␥ rather resembles the action of the fully antagonistic ici compounds on ers. however, the in vivo consequences of antagonist binding to err␥ (e.g. an enhanced receptor degradation as for er/ici complexes (30, 33) or potential
tissue-specific effects as for er␣䡠serm complexes (46)) remain
to be established in future studies.
a “fortuitous”  xxxd1685xxx  molecule bound at the surface of
the err␥ lbd—unexpectedly, in crystal form 1 of the err␥
lbd䡠4- xxxd3285xxx  complex,  xxxd1685xxx  (or a closely related bile acid)
was co-crystallized. one possible explanation for the presence
of  xxxd1685xxx  is that the molecule has been co-purified from the
e. coli expression host, since bacteria present in the human
colon are known to be involved in the metabolism of bile acids
that escape the enterohepatic circulation (between the liver,
gallbladder, and intestines) (47).  xxxd1685xxx  together with
parts of  xxxg1956xxx  from a neighboring molecule covers the hydrophobic coactivator groove and, thus, stabilizes the crystal packing,
a phenomenon that has been previously observed for a detergent molecule shielding the hydrophobic cleft in crystals of the
rar␥ lbd (48). the proximity of  xxxd1685xxx  to the entrance of
the lbp and the amine moiety of 4- xxxd3285xxx  raises the possibility
that ligands may be designed that further extend onto the
err␥ lbd surface. however, such an approach will require a
more careful analysis of the “binding” mode of  xxxd1685xxx .
currently, we do not see any physiological relevance for the
observed association of  xxxd1685xxx  with the err␥ lbd. although err␥ seems to be expressed at low levels in the small
intestine and the liver (13, 49 –51), the binding position of the
bile acid at the err␥ surface is clearly determined by the
crystal packing and only compatible with an antagonist but not
an agonist lbd conformation. it, therefore, also remains unclear how  xxxd1685xxx  was “fortuitously” co-purified with the
err␥ apolbd.
ligand binding selectivity of errs—errs have been shown
to bind des (all errs) and 4- xxxd3285xxx  (err␤ and err␥) but not
e2 or ral (21–23). the comparison of the des and 4- xxxd3285xxx 
complexes of the err␥ and the er␣ lbds reveals small but
significant differences in the architecture of the lbp that explain ligand binding selectivity. the slightly shifted binding
position of des and the small rotation of 4- xxxd3285xxx  in the lbp of
err␥ apparently result from space restrictions due to the
presence of leu-345 (ile-424 in er␣) and, relative to er␣, a
shifted position of h7. furthermore, the rotated side chain of
phe-435 (leu-525 in er␣) “pushes” the 4- xxxd3285xxx  amine moiety
toward asp-273. importantly, in er␣ ile-424 can adapt
through conformational changes to ligands such as e2 or ral
that protrude much deeper into the cavity than 4- xxxd3285xxx  (28, 29).
in err␥, however, even taking into account protein dynamics,

in summary, the results presented in this study establish the
conformational changes of the err␥ lbd occurring upon des
or 4- xxxd3285xxx  binding and reveal determinants of selective ligand
binding and differences in the dynamic behavior of  xxxg1956xxx  of
errs versus ers.
