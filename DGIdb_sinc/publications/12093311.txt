abstract

objective: celecoxib and rofecoxib are two relatively new nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (nsaids) that selectively inhibit the cyclo-oxygenase-2
(cox-2) isoenzyme at therapeutic concentrations. the nephrotoxic potential of
selective cox-2 inhibitors has not been clearly established. this study was conducted in order to understand the association between acute renal failure and the
two cox-2 inhibitors celecoxib and rofecoxib.
methods: a search was performed in the us food and drug administration’s
(fda) adverse event reporting system (aers) to identify cases of renal failure
submitted to the fda. a medline search of the english language literature
was also performed to identify published cases of renal failure associated with
celecoxib and rofecoxib.
results: one hundred twenty-two and 142 domestic us cases of celecoxib and
rofecoxib-associated renal failure, respectively, were identified in the aers
database. the literature search identified 19 cases of acute renal impairment in
association with celecoxib and rofecoxib. in addition, drug regulatory authorities
in the uk, canada, and australia have received about 50 reports of renal failure
with celecoxib and rofecoxib. descriptive statistics of the aers cases have been
summarised in this report.
conclusions: data from aers and published case reports suggest that use of
both these drugs is associated with renal effects similar to that of conventional
nonselective nsaids. physicians should be aware that serious or life-threatening
renal failure has been reported in patients with normal or impaired renal function
after short-term therapy with celecoxib and rofecoxib. patients at greatest risk for
renal injury are those with pre-existing renal impairment, heart failure, liver dysfunction, those taking diuretics and/or ace inhibitors, and the elderly. kidney
function should be monitored closely for any signs of potential renal injuries soon
after initiating treatment with these agents, especially in high-risk populations.
in addition, healthcare practitioners should adequately warn patients of the signs
and symptoms of serious renal toxicity, and of the need for them to see their
physician promptly if they occur. celecoxib and rofecoxib are not recommended
for use in patients with advanced renal disease.

nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (nsaids)
are commonly used for the management of pain
and inflammation. the use of conventional nsaids
has been associated with serious gastrointestinal
adverse events including ulceration, bleeding, and
perforation. celecoxib and rofecoxib are the first
two members of selective cyclo-oxygenase-2
(cox-2) inhibitors that were approved for marketing by the us food and drug administration
(fda) in december 1998 and may 1999, respectively. the selective cox-2 inhibitors or coxibs
were developed largely with the belief that these
drugs will have a better safety profile than the conventional nsaids.[1,2] two large randomised controlled clinical trials have been published that examined the efficacy and safety of celecoxib and
rofecoxib.[3,4] neither study [celecoxib longterm arthritis safety study (class) nor vioxx
gastrointestinal outcomes research (vigor)] reported celecoxib or rofecoxib to have a clinically
significant advantage over conventional nsaids
in terms of general safety or tolerability as reflected in endpoints such as withdrawals due to
adverse events.[5]
after the gastrointestinal tract, the kidneys are the
second most frequent organ affected by adverse
events associated with nsaid use.[6] the renal adverse effects of nsaids include decreased renal
perfusion, decreased glomerular filtration rate, decreased sodium/potassium excretion, oedema,
increased blood pressure, and interstitial nephritis.[7-9] the nephrotoxic potential of selective
cox-2 inhibitors has not been clearly established.
cox-2 is expressed in the human kidney and has
a role in normal renal physiology. experimental
evidence suggests that the profile of renal actions
of selective cox-2 inhibitors is similar to that of
conventional nsaids.[10]
in order to understand the association between
acute renal failure and the two cox-2 inhibitors
celecoxib and rofecoxib, we summarise cases reported to the fda’s spontaneous reporting system
database known as adverse event reporting system (aers).

ahmad et al.

materials and methods
the fda receives spontaneous reports of adverse
drug events primarily from physicians, pharmacists and consumers, either directly or via pharmaceutical manufacturers. reports are coded using
the medical dictionary for regulatory activities
(meddra) terminology[11] and entered in into
aers. in recent years, the fda received approximately 250 000 adverse event reports annually.
from 1969, when fda’s spontaneous reporting
system was first launched, to the present, the aers
database has accumulated over 2 million reports.
a computerised search of the aers database identified cases of renal failure in association with
celecoxib and rofecoxib.
method of selection of adverse event
reporting system (aers) cases

we searched the aers database using the following meddra terms: renal failure and impairment; renal vascular and ischaemic conditions; and
nephropathies. the search included all reports entered into aers up to october 2000.
case definition of renal failure

to accommodate the various ways in which renal failure was annotated in the adverse event reports, we defined renal failure as:
• a rise in serum creatinine of ≥0.5 mg/dl, if the
baseline serum creatinine is <3.0 mg/dl; or
• a rise in serum creatinine of ≥1.0 mg/dl, if the
baseline serum creatinine is ≥3.0 mg/dl; or
• a ≥20% decline in recovery serum creatinine
from peak serum creatinine; or
• a peak serum creatinine of ≥2 mg/dl and one or
more events from the sign/symptom list is mentioned (see below for sign/symptom list); or
• a rise in blood urea nitrogen (bun) (>25 mg/dl)
and one or more events from the sign/symptom
list is mentioned (see ‘sign/symptom’ list section); or
• any case requiring phosphate binders (i.e. calcium, aluminium) or potassium-binding resins
or sodium bicarbonate (to correct acidosis); or
drug safety 2002; 25 (7)

renal failure associated with celecoxib and rofecoxib

• any case requiring dialysis or kidney transplant;
or
• any case with a reported diagnosis of renal failure or acute renal failure.
sign/symptom list

events in the sign and sympton list were as follows: decreased urinary output; increased blood
pressure; increased potassium (serum potassium
>5.1 mmol/l); decreased sodium (serum sodium
<135 mmol/l); hyperphosphataemia; metabolic
acidosis (serum bicarbonate <20 mmol/l); azotaemia; uraemia; oedema; symptoms of congestive
heart failure.
renal failure cases included reports of renal
failure, acute renal failure, or any renal insufficiency with adequate data consistent with the case
definition. additionally, all cases had to have a
temporal relationship with the intake of celecoxib
or rofecoxib and an outcome consistent with our
case definition of renal failure.
we used the following criteria to exclude cases:
• events not related to the drug administration,
e.g. renal failure reported while patient had car
accident and went into multi-organ failure
• events resulting from a previously existing underlying renal disorder
• events more related to (or confounded by) another suspect drug (two suspects reported) or
concomitant drug(s), based on their therapy
dates, and the other drug(s) is labelled for renal
failure
• events for which causality cannot be assessed
due to multiple suspect drugs (three or more)
• no evidence that the patient received the drug,
including unconfirmed second hand report
• no evidence that the event of interest occurred
including unconfirmed second hand report (i.e.
reporter was notified by competitor’s drug representative)
• evidence of hepatorenal syndrome (concomitant liver and renal failure)
• renal failure precipitated by concomitant rhabdomyolysis, or acute gastrointestinal bleeding,
or sepsis

• fluid retention with no indication of renal failure
• event did not meet our case definition for renal
failure.
we also reviewed published cases of renal failure reported in association with celecoxib and
rofecoxib. a medline search of the english language literature was performed (june, 2002) using
the following terms to identify published cases of
renal failure with celecoxib and rofecoxib: kidney;
renal failure; and renal toxicity.
results
review of cases in aers

a total of 630 reports (256 reports with celecoxib and 374 with rofecoxib) of renal events were
identified from the search of aers. a hands-on
review of these reports identified 122 and 142 unduplicated domestic reports of renal failure associated with celecoxib and rofecoxib, respectively.
descriptive statistics for the renal failure case series are provided in table i. a summary of the cases
for each drug case series will be outlined.
celecoxib case series

in the celecoxib case series, the median age was
72 years (see table i). age and gender were not
stated in 18 and 14 reports, respectively. among
the cases where gender was reported, there was a
preponderance of females. of the 81 (66%) cases
that mentioned time to onset of adverse renal
symptoms from the start of celecoxib therapy, the
median time was 18 days. in four (5%) cases, the
time of onset was less than or equal to 3 days and
in 33 (41%) cases, this was less than or equal to 14
days. dosage was mentioned in 88 (72%) reports
and it was within the labelling recommendation in
all patients except one. one patient received 400mg
twice daily, at least twice the recommended dose
of celecoxib for his unspecified backache (an offlabel indication in the us) and osteoarthrosis.
serum creatinine (scr) changes (peak scr
minus baseline scr) were reported in 44 cases
(36%). the mean scr change was 2.9 mg/dl (range

0.5 to 7.6 mg/dl). in all 30 cases where scr changes
were reported as 2 mg/dl or above, the reported
total daily dose of celecoxib was within the recommended dosage. those cases reporting a peak and
recovery serum creatinine (37 cases, 30%) noted
an average decline of 1.8 mg/dl (range = 0.5 to
4.5 mg/dl) to recovery. positive dechallenge was
noted in 55 (45%) cases. positive rechallenge was
reported in two cases and these are described later.
sixty-four percent of the patients were hospitalised
and 12% underwent dialysis. in nearly 20% of
cases, the reporter considered the adverse renal
event to be life-threatening. eight (6%) patients
who experienced renal failure died and the reporters suspected celecoxib to have played a role in
their death. forty-five cases reported a baseline scr.

of the 45 cases, 15 (33%) had a baseline scr ≤1.0
mg/dl, 27 (60%) had a baseline scr ≤1.2 mg/dl,
and 32 (71%) had a baseline scr ≤1.5 mg/dl.
there were two cases with apparently normal
kidney function and no history of renal disease
who experienced renal failure. subsequent to the
initiation of celecoxib, the time to onset of renal
failure was 4 days in one case and 30 days in the
other. all cases presented with risk factors for renal
failure aside from celecoxib use with the exception
of 26 (21%) case reports, which did not state any
risk factors. of the 96 cases reporting risk factors,
the most prevalent medical condition reported
was hypertension (39%), followed by diabetes
mellitus (29%), congestive heart failure (22%) and
pre-existing or history of renal failure or renal indrug safety 2002; 25 (7)

renal failure associated with celecoxib and rofecoxib

sufficiency (21%). among patients with pre-existing renal disease, worsening of the patient’s renal
status was observed. co-prescription of diuretics
(39%) was most common, followed by ace inhibitors (19%), and/or recent use of other nsaids
(5%).
two representative cases are as follows. a 78year-old female with a history of hypertension,
coronary artery disease, diabetes mellitus, and peripheral neuropathy was started treatment with
celecoxib 200mg (at an unspecified frequency) for
osteoarthritis. her baseline scr was 1.1 mg/dl and
bun was 16 mg/dl. approximately 120 days later,
her scr increased to 3.1 mg/dl and bun to 40
mg/dl and her medications, namely celecoxib,
captopril, and hydrochlorothiazide were discontinued. at that time she was also taking cotrimoxazole (trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole) for a
urinary tract infection and this drug was also discontinued. about 35 days later her scr was 1.2
mg/dl and bun 20 mg/dl. nearly 2 months later,
her scr was 1.2 mg/dl and bun 29 mg/dl and
celecoxib 100mg daily was restarted. about 12
days later her scr increased to 2.0 mg/dl and bun
to 42 mg/dl and celecoxib was discontinued. a
week later her scr was 1.4 mg/dl and bun was
30 mg/dl. other concomitant medications that
were not discontinued included atenolol, simvastatin, insulin and sertraline.
a physician reported that an 88-year-old female
who was receiving celecoxib for an unspecified
disease, dose and duration experienced acute renal
failure for which she was hospitalised for 10 days.
according to her physician, the acute renal failure
resolved rapidly after unspecified therapy. within
a month, the physician restarted her on celecoxib
and she was hospitalised again with acute renal
failure and had to undergo dialysis. her scr rose
to 4.3 mg/dl and bun to 58 mg/dl. celecoxib was
discontinued and she again responded to unspecified therapy. there is no mention of concomitant
illness or medications.

rofecoxib case series

in the rofecoxib case series, the median age was
75 years (see table i). twenty-nine cases (20%) did
not report age and 18 cases (13%) did not report
gender. among the cases where gender was reported, there was a preponderance of females. the
dosage of rofecoxib was reported in 103 cases and
fell within the recommended range of 12.5 to 50
mg/day with a mean of 26.6 mg/day and a median
of 25mg/day. the onset of adverse renal symptoms
was reported in 100 cases and occurred at an average of approximately 33 days after the initiation of
rofecoxib; however, the median was 10 days.
thirty-two (32%) cases occurred within 3 days and
65 (65%) cases occurred within 14 days. fifty-two
cases noted a baseline and peak scr which showed
a mean scr change of 4.0 mg/dl (range = 0.4 to
12.9 mg/dl). those cases reporting a peak and recovery scr (45 cases, 32%) noted an average decline of 2.8 mg/dl (range = 0.4 to 11.1 mg/dl) to
recovery. there were only 2 rechallenge cases
where one was positive and the other negative at
the time of reporting. nearly 70% of the cases required hospitalisation and 15% reported the need
for dialysis. death occurred in nine (6%) cases
and the reporters suspected rofecoxib-associated
renal failure as a contributory factor.
of the 142 cases, 12 reported normal kidney
function or no history of renal dysfunction prior to
initiating rofecoxib. fifty-four cases reported a
baseline scr. of the 54 cases, 10 (19%) had a
baseline scr ≤1.0 mg/dl, 16 (30%) had a baseline
scr ≤1.2 mg/dl, and 30 (56%) had a baseline scr
≤1.5 mg/dl.
common risk factors consist of concomitant
disease states and medications and were multiple
for most patients. of the 112 cases reporting risk
factors, the most prevalent medical condition reported was hypertension (33%), followed by diabetes
mellitus (27%), pre-existing or history of renal
failure or renal insufficiency (25%), and congestive heart failure (21%). co-prescription of diuretics was most common (54%), followed by condrug safety 2002; 25 (7)

comitant or recent use of selective or nonselective
nsaids (42%), and ace inhibitors (36%).
two representative cases are as follows. a 79year-old female with concurrent diabetes mellitus,
lymph and peripheral oedema, atherosclerotic
heart disease, and a prior mastectomy was placed
on rofecoxib for osteoarthritis. concomitant medications included furosemide ( xxxd2167xxx ),  xxxd2627xxx , potassium, and lisinopril. the patient was
admitted to the hospital 3.5 weeks later for oedema.
laboratory tests showed a scr of 4.3 mg/dl, bun
of 97 mg/dl, potassium of 6.8 mmol/l, and phosphorus of 7.2 mg/dl. the nephrologist diagnosed
acute renal failure and hyperkalaemia due to furosemide, lisinopril, rofecoxib, and potassium. rofecoxib was discontinued and the patient was
stabilised and discharged one week later. the patient restarted rofecoxib without the physician’s
consent and, again, experienced acute renal failure
(scr = 8.3 mg/dl, bun = 65 mg/dl, potassium =
5.5 mmol/l, phosphorus = 10.6 mg/dl).
a 73-year-old female with multiple medical
problems including osteoporosis, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease, atrial fibrillation, asthma, and angina developed renal failure, congestive heart failure, digoxin toxicity, and thrombocytopenia after 1 week
of rofecoxib. admission laboratory values revealed a scr of 2.2 mg/dl, bun of 50 mg/dl, ph
of 7.1, potassium of 7.0 mmol/l, and a digoxin
concentration of 5.6 ng/ml (baseline laboratory
values: scr = 1.7 mg/dl, bun = 25 to 28 mg/dl,
and digoxin <2.0 ng/ml). she experienced a cardiac arrest and was intubated and revived. she also
required haemodialysis.

reports of renal failure associated with celecoxib
and rofecoxib .[22-25]
discussion
adverse renal effects with the use of conventional nsaids is widely recognised and appreciated. [26-28] however, the risk of serious renal
toxicity is relatively low. nonetheless, up to approximately 5% of individuals exposed to nsaids
may develop some adverse renal outcome.[29]
while the risk is uncommon in healthy individuals,
the incidence can approach 20% in patients at high
risk.[30] in the us, an estimated 0.5 to 2.5 million
individuals each year have the potential to manifest an nsaid-related renal adverse effect syndrome.[31]
spontaneous reporting systems are an excellent
means to detect the occurrence of rare adverse
events in spite of limitations including extensive
underreporting and inadequate or missing information in the reports. our evaluation of the postmarketing adverse event reports of renal toxicity
with the selective cox-2 inhibitors revealed serious or life-threatening renal toxicity including
acute renal failure in association with the use of
both celecoxib and rofecoxib. although the greatest risk of acute renal failure with these drugs was
observed in patients with multiple risk factors,
there were also cases reported in patients with apparently normal kidney function. a small fraction
of the cases had an acute onset of renal failure occurring within 3 days. our findings are consistent
with the literature reports of adverse renal events
associated with these drugs. selective cox-2
inhibitors, celecoxib and rofecoxib may not offer
distinct advantages over conventional nsaids
with respect to renal regulation of sodium excretion, blood pressure, and glomerular filtration rate
and should be used with caution or avoided in patients with predisposing diseases.[32,33]
conclusions
in summary, cases of acute renal failure in association with the use of both celecoxib and rofecoxib
drug safety 2002; 25 (7)

renal failure associated with celecoxib and rofecoxib

have been reported to the fda. additionally, there
have been published reports of renal impairment in
association with these drugs. these data suggest
that the newer drugs, celecoxib and rofecoxib,
share the propensity of conventional nonselective
nsaids to cause adverse renal events. these findings are also in accord with experimental evidence
which suggests that the profile of renal actions of
cox-2 inhibitors is similar to conventional
nsaids.[10]
physicians should be aware that serious or lifethreatening renal failure has been reported in patients with normal or impaired renal function after
short-term therapy. as stated in the current us
labelling for celecoxib and rofecoxib, patients at
greatest risk for renal injury are those with preexisting renal impairment, heart failure, liver dysfunction, those taking diuretics and/or ace inhibitors, and the elderly. kidney function should be
monitored closely for any signs of potential renal
injuries soon after initiating treatment with selective cox-2 inhibitors, especially in high-risk populations. in addition, healthcare practitioners
should adequately warn patients of the signs and
symptoms of serious renal toxicity, and of the need
for them to see their physician promptly if they
occur. celecoxib and rofecoxib are not recommended in patients with advanced renal disease.
