summary. the cholinomimetic activities of the antidepressant drug  xxxd2647xxx  have been investigated, in vitro and in
vivo, in rodents.  xxxd2647xxx , and its metabolite sr 95070b
[3-(2-morpholinoethylamino)-4-methyl-6-(2-hydroxyphenyl)
pyridazine hydrochloride] selectively displaced [3h] xxxd2965xxx  from its cortical and hippocampal binding sites,
and only weakly inhibited the binding of [3h]-nmethylscopolamine in either the rat cerebellum, heart and
salivary glands, or the guinea-pig ileum. in mice, none of
these drugs induced the typical cholinergic side-effects up to
lethal doses.  xxxd2647xxx  and sr 95070b antagonized rotations induced by an intrastriatal injection of  xxxd2965xxx 
in mice, after intraperitoneal and/or oral administration.
 xxxd2647xxx  also antagonized atropine-induced mydriasis in
mice. both  xxxd2647xxx  and sr 95070b potentiated the tremorigenic effect of oxotremorine without inducing tremor
when injected alone.
finally,  xxxd2647xxx  and sr 95070b, after parenteral and/
or oral injection, antagonized the scopolamine-induced deficit in passive avoidance learning, and enhanced short-term
retention in the social memory test, in rats. the muscarinic
agonists  xxxd215xxx , oxotremorine and rs 86 [2-ethyl-8methyl-2,8 diazaspiro-4,5 decan-l,3 dion hydrobromide], as
well as the acetylcholine esterase inhibitors physostigmine
and tacrinc were active in most of these models.
these results indicate that  xxxd2647xxx , and its metabolite
sr 95070b, have cholinomimetic activities which could be,
at least in part, mediated by their selective affinity for m~
muscarinic receptors. thus  xxxd2647xxx  could represent a potential useful drug for the treatment of senile dementias and
cognitive impairments occurring in elderly people.

introduction
a number of studies has shown that, among various neurotransmitter systems, cholinergic pathways arising from the
basal forebrain and innervating the cerebral cortex, or projecting from the septal areas to the hippocampus, are
severely impaired in various diseases among which the senile
dementia of the alzheimer type (for review, see whitehouse
et al. 1985). a dramatic loss of cholinergic neurons in the

basal forebrain was reported, and was associated with a
marked reduction of presynaptic markers (e.g. choline
acetyltransferase activity) within the cortex and the hippocampus. however, postsynaptic muscarinic receptors, particularly of the m1 type, appear to be preserved in these
areas (mash et al. 1985; araujo et al. 1988).
among the various attempts to alleviate the cognitive
impairments occurring in senile dementia of the alzheimer
type, an impressive amount of research has been directed
towards the search of direct agonists at cholinergic muscarinic receptors, mostly at m1 receptors which appear to
be prevalent in the cortex and the hippocampus (hoss and
messner 1986), and to be involved in cognitive processes
relevant to senile dementia of the alzheimer type (bartus et
al. 1982; johns et al. 1985; wurtman 1986; hershenson and
moos 1986). however, most of the available agonists either
poorly enter the brain (carbachol, mcneil a 343) or have
weak affinity for m~ receptors (carbachol,  xxxd215xxx , rs 86:
2-ethyl-8-methyl-2,8 diazaspiro-4,5 decan-l,3 dion hydrobromide), or are not selective for this receptor subtype
(oxotremorine, rs 86, af 30) (birdsall et al. 1983; palacios
et al. 1986; saunders et al. 1987). moreover, all these drugs
more or less induce strong detrimental side-effects both in
animals and humans (chermat et al. 1976; bruno et al.
1986).
we have recently reported that  xxxd2647xxx , an original
antidepressant drug, not only was devoid of anticholinergic
side-effects in rodents, but could even activate brain
cholinergic transmission (biziere et al. 1985, 1986). in addition, it has been shown that  xxxd2647xxx  increased acetylcholine levels within the rat striatnm and hippocampus
(garattini et al. 1984). finally  xxxd2647xxx  has been reported
to be beneficial in the treatment of senile dementias (passeri
et al. 1987).
these results have prompted us to further investigate the
effect of  xxxd2647xxx  on brain cholinergic transmission, using
both in vitro and in vivo approaches. the effect ofminaprine
on memory processes was also studied. in these studies,
 xxxd2647xxx  was compared to the muscarinic agonists oxotremorine,  xxxd215xxx  and rs 86 (palacios et al. 1986), to
the inhibitors of acetylcholine esterase, physostigmine and
 xxxd3270xxx  (tacrine; kaul 1962) and to the
nootropic drug  xxxd181xxx  (cumin et al. 1982); this latter
drug was studied because it was proposed to facilitate memory processes through indirect activation of cholinergic
brain transmissions (sethy 1983; pedata et al. 1984). in
addition, the ortho-hydroxylated metabolite of  xxxd2647xxx ,
sr 95070b [3-(2-morpholino-ethylamino)-4-methyl-6-(2hydroxyphenyl) pyridazine hydrochloride] (davi e t al.
1981), was studied in most in vitro and in vivo models used.

material and methods

animals. for binding experiments, male sprague-dawley
rats weighing 200-250 g, and male guinea-pigs weighing
2 5 0 - 300 g, were used. for behavioural experiments, female
swiss cd1 mice (body weight 1 8 - 2 2 g; except for the turning experiments: 2 5 - 3 0 g) were used. passive avoidance
procedures were conducted in male sprague-dawley rats
weighing 300-350 g, and social memory was assessed in
male wistar rats weighing 400-450 g at the beginning of
the experiments; in this latter model, juvenile rats were male
wistar rats weighing 4 0 - 50 g.
all these animals were obtained from charles river
breeding laboratories (st aubin les elbeuf, france).
radioligand binding assays. the specific binding of [3h] xxxd2965xxx  (1 nm) was performed (at 0 ° c) in rat cortical
and hippocampal membranes (prepared in 50 mm phosphate buffer) according to watson et al. (1982) and to hammer et al. (1980), respectively. the specific binding of [3h]n-methylscopolamine (0.3 nm) was performed in guineapig ileal membranes, and in rat cerebellar membranes, according to hulme et al. (1978) and to watson et al. (1986),
respectively. the displacement of [3h]-n-methylscopolamine (0.5-0.7 nm) was also studied in rat heart and salivary glands membranes according to hammer et al. (1986).
behavioural observations in mice and rats. groups of 5 to 10
mice or rats received the tested drugs at increasing intraperitoneal (i.p.) or oral (p.o.) doses. they were housed
by 5 (mice) or i (rats) in macrolon cages with saw-dust, with
free access to standard food and tap water, and observed
for 6 h following injection. in mice, rectal temperature was
measured by means of an electrical probe (model ret-3,
bailey instruments, saddle brook, n j, usa) connected to
a thermometer, 30 min to 3 h after i.p. injection. lethality
was recorded 48 h after drug injections.
antagonism of  xxxd2965xxx -induced contraiateral turning in
mice. drugs or vehicle were administered i.p. or p.o., 15 or
30 rain respectively (except tacrine, 60 rain), before a direct
injection of  xxxd2965xxx  (1 gg) into the right striatum of
conscious mice by free-hand technique, as described by
worms et al. (1986). briefly, the injection was made by
means o f a 5 gl hamilton syringe with a 10 mm needle (final
length below the skin: 3.5 ram), without any surgery; the
injection point was 1 mm internal and 1 mm caudal to the
summit of the right orbitus. the number of turns was
counted between 2 and 4, 8 and 10, 13 and 15 rain postinjection (worms and biziere 1987).
antagonism of atropine-induced mydriasis in mice. drugs or
vehicle were injected i.p. simultaneously with atropine
(0.1 mg/kg, i.p.) or its vehicle. the pupillary diameter was
measured in arbitrary units (wild-leiz binocular lens with
a graduated wide-angle ocular), before drug injections, and
15, 30, 60, 90 and 120 rain after the injection of atropine.
the differences between pre- and post-injection values were
calculated at each time, and cumulated for each animal.
potentiation of oxotremorine-induced tremor in mice. animals received the drugs or vehicle, by i.p. route, 15 min
before an i. p. injection of oxotremorine (0.1 mg/kg, in base).
the degree of tremor (0: absent; 1 : weak; 2: moderate; 3 :

strong) was assessed 30 min after the injection of oxotremorine.

antagonism of scopolamine-induced deficit in passive avoidance learning in rats. the method described by jarvik and
koop (1967) was used with slight modifications.
the apparatus consisted of a box divided by a wall into
two compartments of the same size. in the middle of the
wall a guillotine door can be manually lifted. one compartment was lit with a 20 w electric bulb, the other compartment was dark. the room was dark during all the experimental sessions. the box was connected to a microcomputer
apple ii which monitored and recorded behavioural events.
the rats were randomly assigned to the different pharmacological treatments within the same breeding cage.
scopolamine (0.5 mg/kg i.p.) or its vehicle was injected
30 rain before the acquisition trial of passive avoidance. the
drug under investigation or its vehicle was administered at
the same time as scopolamine for the s.c. route or 30 rain
(or 60 rain for tacrine) before scopolamine for the oral route.
animals were placed individually in the brightly lit compartment of the apparatus; the guillotine door was slowly
lifted, the animal was allowed to enter the dark compartment
and the latency to cross was recorded. the guillotine door
was then smoothly lowered and a scrambled electric shock
(1 ma for 3 s; square signal, 50 c/s, 115 v) was delivered
through the grid floor. on the following day retention was
measured (drug-free session). the rats were placed in the
brightly lit compartment and the latency to enter the dark
compartment was recorded (maximum duration 5 rain). ten
rats were used for each treatment.
social memory in rats. the procedure used has been described by dantzer et al. (1987) and by perio et al. (1989).
briefly, an unfamiliar juvenile rat was placed in the home
cage of an adult rat for 5 min. the time spent by the adult
rat in investigating the juvenile (nosing, sniffing, grooming,
pawing or close following) was recorded. the adult rat was
then immediately treated by the test drugs, or their vehicle,
and was again exposed (5 min) to the same juvenile 2 h later.
at this time point, vehicle-treated rats no longer recognized
the juvenile, i.e. the time of investigation was similar to that
observed during the first exposure. if under the influence of
a drug, the second investigation duration was reduced, then
in an additional experiment, the drug was tested again, with
a different juvenile being presented to the adult rat instead
of the same juvenile, for the second exposure. in these conditions, any reduction in the exploration of the different
juvenile was considered as a non-specific effect of the drug.
the results were expressed for each animal as the ratio
of the second exposure to the first exposure (ratio of investigation duration). ten rats were used in each group.
statistics. for the statistical analysis of the data in the
 xxxd2965xxx  and atropine experiments, a one-way anova
was performed followed by a two-tailed student's t-test for
comparison of the means. data from the oxotremorine experiment were analyzed by a mann-whitney u-test. the
data from the passive avoidance and the social memory
experiments were submitted to a one-way anova and the
means were compared by the neuman-keuls test.
chemicals and drugs. the following drugs were used (source

chimie, paris, france), sr 95070b hydrochloride (pr. c. g.
wermuth, strasbourg, france),  xxxd215xxx  hydrobromide,
 xxxd247xxx , carbamylcholine chloride (carbachol),
oxotremorine sesquifumarate, physostigmine sulphate and
(-)scopolamine hydrochloride (sigma, st. louis, mo,
usa), tacrine (janssen chimica, beerse, belgium), rs 86
(sandoz, basel, switzerland),  xxxd181xxx  (dr. j.c. molimard, chemistry department, sanofi recherche, montpellier, france) and  xxxd2965xxx  dihydrochloride (extracted
from the commercially available form gastrozepine,
boehringer, reims, france). tritiated compounds were purchased from new england nuclear (boston, ma, usa).
all drugs were dissolved in distilled water, except for intrastriatal injections, where  xxxd2965xxx  was solubilized in a
phosphate buffer (merck, darmstadt, frg) with a final ph
of 6.0. all doses refer to the available form (salt or base)
unless otherwise stated. volumes of injection were 20 ml/kg
in mice, and 5 (s.c.) or 10 ml/kg (p.o.) in rats; a volume of
1 gl was used for intrastriatal injection of  xxxd2965xxx  in
mice.

 xxxd2647xxx  and sr 95070b displaced [3h]- xxxd2965xxx  from
its hippocampal and cortical binding sites, in the 10 gm
and 1 gm range, respectively (table 1). in our experimental
conditions, displacement isotherms were all competitive,
yielding hill coefficients close to unity ( xxxd2647xxx : n h =
0.98; sr 95070b: n i l = 0 . 8 1 ; non significantly different
from 1). in contrast, both compounds hardly displaced [3h]n-methylscopolamine from its cerebellar or peripheral binding sites. among reference agonists, rs 86 displaced [3h] xxxd2965xxx  between 0.7 and 2.8~tm, and [3h]-nmethylscopolamine between 6 and 20 t~m (ics0s). oxotremorine displaced both ligands in the 0.1 gm range. among
reference antagonists,  xxxd2965xxx  proved to be 50 to 100
times more potent to displace [3h]- xxxd2965xxx  than to displace [3h]-n-methylscopolamine, whereas atropine was
equipotent versus both ligands (nm range) (table 1).

behavioural observations
in mice, neither  xxxd2647xxx  (i.p. or p.o.) nor sr 95070b
(i. p.) induced the typical cholinergic side-effects (i.e. tremor,
salivation, lacrymation, defecation). thus,  xxxd2647xxx , at
doses greater than 40 mg/kg, i.p. or 125 mg/kg, p.o., and
sr 95070b (over 200 mg/kg, i.p.), induced clonic seizures
followed by death after respiratory arrest (50% lethal doses:
 xxxd2647xxx , 63 mg/kg, i.p. and 187 mg/kg, p. o. ; sr 95070b,
200 mg/kg, i.p.).
at lower doses,  xxxd2647xxx  (30 mg/kg, i.p. and 125 mg/
kg, p.o.) decreased motility, but did not modify core temperature (data not shown). sr 95070b decreased motility
from the dose of 50 mg/kg, i.p. and lowered body temperature from 12.5 mg/kg, i.p. ( - 1 . 7 + 0 . 6 ° c at 12.5mg/kg;
- 2 . 9 + 0 . 6 ° c at 25mg/kg; time 30min post-injection;
p < 0.01 vs. pretreatment values). in the same experimental
conditions, rs 86 induced salivation, lacrymation, tremor

antagonism of  xxxd2965xxx -induced turning in mice
as shown in fig. 1,  xxxd2647xxx  and sr 95070b antagonized
the contralateral turning behaviour induced by intrastriatal
 xxxd2965xxx . minimal effective doses (med) were 10 mg/kg
(i.p. and p.o.) and 1 mg/kg (i.p.), respectively. reference
cholinomimetic drugs also antagonized turning, with meds
of 0.3 mg/kg, p.o. for rs 86, 3 mg/kg, p.o. for tacrine and
30 mg/kg, p.o. for  xxxd181xxx .

antagonism of atropine-induced mydriasis in mice
 xxxd2647xxx  dose-dependently antagonized atropine-induced
mydriasis, from 3 to 30 mg/kg, i.p., without affecting pupillary diameter by itself (table 2).  xxxd215xxx  (0.3 to 3 mg/kg,
i.p.), rs 86 (0.3 mg/kg, i.p.) and physostigmine (0.1 mg/
kg, i.p.) also diminished this effect of atropine. however,
physostigmine, alone, did induce a strong, significant, myosis (table 2).

fig. 2. antagonism of the scopolamine-induced deficit in passive

scopolamine (i. p.), 30 rain before the acquisition session on day 1.
on day 2 (retention), the latency to enter the dark compartment
was recorded in s (cut-off 300 s), without drug. the columns indicate
the mean + sem latencies (day 2), expressed as percentages of
control (vehicle treated) values. ten rats were used in each group.
control values (in s; mean±sem):  xxxd2647xxx , 294_+4; sr
95070b, 288 + 6; oxotremorine, 287 4- 9; physostigmine, 296 + 4.
anovas:  xxxd2647xxx , f ( 3 - 36) = 40.8; sr 95070b, f(3-- 36) =
64.6; oxotremorine, f(3--36) = 23.0; physostigmine, f(3-36) =
49.8; p < 0.01. * p < 0.05; ** p < 0.01 compared to scopolamine

these results indicate that  xxxd2647xxx , and its orthohydroxylated metabolite sr 95070b (davi et al. 1981), have
a selective affinity for central muscarinic receptors of the
m~ type, i.e. labelled by [3h]- xxxd2965xxx  (hammer et al.
1980), and exhibit the behavioural profile of muscarinic
cholinergic stimulants. thus, in vitro,  xxxd2647xxx  displaces
the selective  xxxg447xxx  antagonist  xxxd2965xxx  from its
binding sites in acetylcholine-rich areas, hippocampus and
cortex, which have been reported to contain mostly m ~ type
receptors (hoss and messner 1986; spencer et al. 1986;
wamsley et al. 1984). the affinity of  xxxd2647xxx  for these
receptors appears to be weak but selective, as the drug hardly
displace s the non-selective mt/m2 antagonist n-methylscopolamine in central (cerebellum) or peripheral areas
(heart, salivary glands, ileum) which predominantly contain
m2 type receptors (hoss and messner 1986; giraldo et al.
1987). sr 95070b exhibits a m1 affinity 10 times greater

t h a n that of its parent drug, with still a very low affinity for
m2 receptors, thus yielding a selectivity ratio close to 50
(mean m2 ics0/mean m1 icso; results taken from table 1).
as far as reference drugs are concerned, carbachol has the
same m1 affinity as  xxxd2647xxx  but, in contrast with this
latter drug, has some degree of selectivity for m2 receptors
(mz/m1 ratio = 0.2); the new agonist rs 86 (palacios et al.
1986) is 10 times more potent than  xxxd2647xxx  at m1 receptors with a similar selectivity ratio, whereas the potent
agonist oxotremorine exhibits the same high affinity for m~
and m2 receptors. as expected, the antagonists  xxxd2965xxx 
and atropine are potent muscarinic ligands, with the former
drug exhibiting a high degree o f m1 selectivity (m2/m1
ratio = 65). the present results agree with those reported
in the literature, in terms of both affinity and selectivity

social memory in rats
as shown in fig. 4 a and b,  xxxd2647xxx  (30 mg/kg, s.c.) and
sr 95070b ( 3 - 1 0 mg/kg, s.c.), when injected immediately
after the first presentation, decreased the duration o f exploration of the same juvenile during the second presentation.
similarly, tacrine was active in this model at 1 and 2 mg/kg,
i.p. (fig. 4 c).

administered p.o. 60 rain before scopolamine. the acquisition and

ten to 20 rats were used in each group. control values (in s;

296 + 4 ;  xxxd181xxx , 295 ± 5. anovas:  xxxd2647xxx , f(3-36) =

scopolamine controls (hatched columns)

(doods et al. 1987; kunysz et al. 1988; palacios et al. 1986;
tonnaer et al. 1987).
in behavioural experiments,  xxxd2647xxx  and sr 95070b
did not induce the classical side-effects reported for
cholinomimetic drugs, but antagonize the behavioural effects of various muscarinic receptor antagonists, i.e. turning
induced by the m t antagonist  xxxd2965xxx , mydriasis induced by atropine and learning deficit induced by scopolamine, both non-selective m~/m2 antagonists.. in addition,
 xxxd2647xxx  and its metabolite potentiate the tremor induced
by the non-selective agonist oxotremorine.
reference muscarinic agonists, including rs 86, all induce muscarinic-type side-effects correlated with their m2
affinity (see also chermat et al. 1976; palacios et al. 1986).
the fact that  xxxd2647xxx  and its metabolite do not induce
these side-effects is consistent with their lack of m2 affinity,
particularly in the periphery, and with their good m t selectivity.

fig. 4. effect of  xxxd2647xxx  (a), sr 95070b (b) and tacrine (c) in
the social memory test in rats. the test was performed as described
in the methods section. data are expressed as mean ± sem ratios
of investigation duration. hatched columns represent the values
obtained in the same juvenile group; open columns represent the
values obtained in the different juvenile group. six to 8 rats were
used in each group. anovas:  xxxd2647xxx , f ( 4 - 36) = 4.0, p < 0.01
in the same juvenile condition, and f(2-18) = 1.4, n.s. in the
different juvenile condition; sr 95070b f(3--24) = 4.7, p < 0.01,
and f(2-18) = 1.0, n.s.; tacrine, f(3-27) = 6.3, p < 0.01, and
f(1-10) = 1.7, n.s. * p<0.05; ** p<0.01 compared to the
corresponding placebo (0)

the ability of  xxxd2647xxx  to counteract all the effects of
muscarinic antagonists strongly suggests a cholinomimetic
activity for this drug. this activity is likely related to the
selective affinity of  xxxd2647xxx , and of its metabolite, for
m t type muscarinic receptors; thus,  xxxd2965xxx -induced
turning, as well as deficits in passive avoidance learning,
have been reported to involve a blockade of m t receptors
(worms and biziere 1987; caulfield et al. 1983; hunter and
roberts 1988).
in addition,  xxxd2647xxx , in contrast with the indirect
cholinomimetics physostigmine or tacrine (kaul 1962), does
not inhibit the activity of acetyl-cholinesterase, either in vitro
or ex vivo (garattini et al. 1984). this latter point would

417
also explain the absence of side-effects reported here for
 xxxd2647xxx .
in these behavioural models,  xxxd2647xxx , after i.p. or s. c.
injection, is 10 to 30 times less active than its metabolite,
and 3 to 300 times less potent than reference drugs, which
mean potencies follow the order: oxotremorine =
physostigmine > rs 86 >  xxxd215xxx  > sr 95070b >  xxxd2647xxx  (see also worms and biziere 1987). after oral
administration, in mice ( xxxd2965xxx  model) or rats (scopolamine model),  xxxd2647xxx  appears to be slightly less active
than tacrine (dokla et al. 1987), 3 to 30 times less potent
than rs 86 (palacios et al. 1986) and 3 times as potent as
the nootropic drug  xxxd181xxx  (cumin et al. 1982). it is
noteworthy that, in these models (see also perio et al. 1989),
this latter drug behaves as a cholinomimetic drug. given the
specificity o f the  xxxd2965xxx  model (worms and biziere
1987), these results may indicate that  xxxd181xxx  facilitates
cholinergic brain transmission, through indirect mechanisms as already proposed (sethy 1983; pedata et al. 1984).
finally, in addition to their ability to oppose the learning
deficit induced by scopolamine in a passive avoidance procedure (jarvik and k o o p 1967; elrod and buccafusco 1988),
 xxxd2647xxx  and sr 95070b appear to improve retention in a
new model o f "social" olfactory memory (perio et al. 1989).
in this model based on short-term memory processes
(dantzer et al. 1987), we have previously reported that
 xxxd215xxx  (1 mg/kg, i.p.), rs 86 ( 0 . 5 - 1 mg/kg, i.p.), physostigmine (0.05-0.1 mg/kg, s.c.) and  xxxd181xxx  (50 mg/kg,
i.p.) all enhance retention (perio et al. 1989). thus, in terms
of potency,  xxxd2647xxx  appears to be twice as active as
 xxxd181xxx , 10 times less potent than its metabolite and 30
to 60 times less active than other reference cholinomimetics.
these latter results indicate that, as expected for a cholinomimetic drug (haroutunian et al. 1985; mandel and thal
1988; murray and fibiger 1986),  xxxd2647xxx  has antiamnestic properties and m a y facilitate memory processes.
in agreement with these results, it has been reported
recently that  xxxd2647xxx  reverses the memory deficits induced
by ischaemia in gerbils (araki et al. 1987) and by cycloheximide in mice (kawashima et al. 1987).
in conclusion, all these results indicate that  xxxd2647xxx , in
addition to its antidepressant activities (biziere et al. 1985),
exhibits the behavioural profile of a cholinomimetic drug,
including m e m o r y enhancing properties, without inducing
cholinergic side-effects. these activities o f  xxxd2647xxx  and of
its metabolite sr 95070b are likely related, at least in part,
to their selective affinity for central muscarinic receptors of
the ms type. this profile of activity suggests a potential
usefulness of  xxxd2647xxx  in the treatment of senile dementia
and age-related cognitive impairments. preliminary encouraging results have already been obtained in patients with
senile dementia (passeri et al. 1987).
