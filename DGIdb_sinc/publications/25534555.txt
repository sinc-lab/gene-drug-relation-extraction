 xxxd3294xxx ® ( xxxd3294xxx ) is the ﬁrst approved treatment in the united states for non-24-hour sleep-wake
disorder (non-24). we present here data on the in vitro binding afﬁnity of  xxxd3294xxx  for both human
melatonin receptors mt1 and mt2, as well as the extended screen of other receptors and enzymes.
results indicate that  xxxd3294xxx  is a potent dual melatonin receptor agonist (dmra) with 2.1e4.4 times
greater afﬁnity for the  xxxg1477xxx  believed to mediate circadian rhythm phase-shifting
(ki ¼ 0.0692 nm and ki ¼ 0.17 nm in nih-3t3 and choek1 cells, respectively), than for the  xxxg1476xxx  (ki ¼ 0.304 nm and ki ¼ 0.35 nm, respectively).  xxxd3294xxx  was also shown to have no appreciable afﬁnity for more than 160 other pharmacologically relevant receptors and several enzymes.

1. introduction
circadian rhythms are regulated by an endogenous circadian
pacemaker that resides in the suprachiasmatic nuclei (scn) in
mammals. this pacemaker is the master body clock that regulates
the circadian rhythms of biological processes including the secretion of hormones such as melatonin and cortisol, sleep-wake cycles,
alertness and performance patterns, metabolism and cardiovascular processes (lockley et al., 2007, 2008). in human, the endogenous
rhythm of the scn is typically slightly longer than 24 h and
therefore must be entrained (synchronized) to the 24-h day. the
strongest zeitgeber responsible for entrainment is the daily

lightedark cycle, detected primarily by the intrinsically photosensitive ganglion cells of the retina (czeisler and gooley, 2007;
ramsey et al., 2013).
disruptions in a person's circadian rhythms have been recognized to play a signiﬁcant role in the etiology of a number of serious
and chronic disorders, including obesity (karlsson et al., 2001),
diabetes (morikawa et al, 2005), breast cancer (davis et al., 2001;
schernhammer et al, 2001), colorectal cancer (schernhammer
et al, 2003), cardiovascular diseases (vyas et al, 2012; ruger and
scheer, 2009; knutsson, 2003), depression (boyce and barriball,
2010; monteleone and maj, 2008; turek, 2007), and circadianrhythm sleep-wake disorders (sack et al, 2007) like non-24-hour
sleep-wake disorder (non-24) (lockley et al., 2007; skene et al.,
1999). non-24 is a serious, debilitating, chronic disorder that occurs when individuals are unable to synchronize their endogenous
circadian clock to the 24-h light-dark cycle (american psychiatric
association, 2013; american academy of sleep medicine, 2005).
the majority of reported cases of non-24 occur in blind patients
with no conscious perception of light (lockley et al., 2007;
uchiyama and lockley, 2009). the growing understanding of the
importance of circadian regulation in these complex disorders is
expected to spawn the development of speciﬁcally designed
circadian regulators that can address the underlying circadian
component of these conditions.

cell system

fig. 1. chemical structure of  xxxd3294xxx .

 xxxd3294xxx  is a novel structurally unique molecular entity,
chemically designated as (1r, 2r)-n-[2- (2,3-dihydrobenzofuran-4yl)cyclopropylmethyl]propanamide, containing two chiral centers
that was developed for the treatment of non-24. its molecular
formula is c15h19no2, and the molecular weight is 245.32.  xxxd3294xxx  differs structurally from melatonin and drugs with known
melatonin agonist activity, in particular by its distinct aromatic
group and linker (fig. 1).  xxxd3294xxx  bears also no structural
relationship to any other approved active substance.
 xxxd3294xxx  was speciﬁcally developed to treat the underlying
circadian basis of non-24, and has undergone rigorous safety
evaluation (swick et al., 2014; sliman et al., 2014; quera-salva et al.,
2014; lockley et al., unpublished results). non-24 is a circadian
rhythm disorder, which primarily affects totally blind individuals,
characterized by the inability to entrain the master body clock to
the 24-h lightedark cycle (american psychiatric association, 2013;
american academy of sleep medicine, 2005). it is estimated that
seventy percent of blind individuals with no light perception have
non-24 (sack and lewy, 2001). patients with non-24 have prolonged periods of misalignment of circadian rhythms, including the
timing of melatonin and cortisol secretion and the sleep-wake cycle, which are associated with signiﬁcant impairments in social and
occupational functioning, and marked subjective distress
(american psychiatric association, 2013).
studies reported here investigated the binding characteristics of
 xxxd3294xxx  for a wide range of receptors and other pharmacological targets, in particular the g protein-coupled melatonin mt1
and mt2 receptors, which are expressed in the central nervous
system and in peripheral tissues (dubocovich and markowska,
2005). results point to the unique receptor binding proﬁle of
 xxxd3294xxx , which acts as a selective and potent dmra with
greater afﬁnity for the  xxxg1477xxx  than for the  xxxg1476xxx , and

no appreciable afﬁnity for more than 160 other pharmacologically
relevant receptors and enzymes, including the gammaaminobutyric acid (gaba) receptor complex and receptors that
bind neuropeptides, cytokines, serotonin, noradrenaline, acetylcholine, and opiates.
2. materials and methods
the speciﬁc afﬁnity of  xxxd3294xxx  for the mt1 and mt2 receptors was evaluated
in two independent experiments using human recombinant receptors and radioligand binding assays. the selectivity of the receptor binding was further evaluated
by determining the afﬁnity for more than 160 other receptors and several enzymes.
furthermore, inhibition of  xxxd1742xxx -stimulated  xxxd1773xxx 
( xxxd1773xxx  or camp) accumulation was conducted in nih-3t3 cells stably
expressing the human mt1 and mt2 receptors.
2.1. binding assays at the mt1 and mt2 receptors
in a ﬁrst experiment, two lines of nih-3t3 cells were used; one cell line stably
expressed the human  xxxg1476xxx  while the second cell line stably expressed the
human  xxxg1477xxx . cells were maintained and passaged as attached monolayers
in dulbecco's modiﬁed eagle medium containing d-glucose, 10 mm hepes, 10% heat
inactivated calf serum and 500 mg/ml  xxxd2191xxx . cultures were incubated in vented
tissue culture ﬂasks at 37  c in a humidiﬁed atmosphere containing 5% co2. cells
were harvested and frozen as pellets at 80  c. membrane homogenates were
prepared in assay buffer (50 mm tris containing 12.5 mm mgcl2 and 2 mm edta,
ph 7.4 at 37  c with hcl) fortiﬁed with 10 mg/ml aprotinin and leupeptin and 100 mm
pmsf, using a dounce homogenizer. the resulting homogenate was centrifuged
(45,000  g, 10 min, 4  c) and the pellet was resuspended in fortiﬁed assay buffer at
a ratio of 0.25 ml per original ﬂask of cells and frozen in aliquots at 80  c until use.
binding assays were performed in duplicate in a total volume of 0.2 ml containing
0.16 ml membrane homogenate diluted appropriately, 0.02 ml 2-[125i] xxxd2377xxx  (0.1 or 0.2 nm ﬁnal concentration for mt1 or mt2, respectively) and 0.02 ml
assay buffer, melatonin or  xxxd3294xxx . nine concentrations of  xxxd3294xxx 
(0.001 nm, 0.01 nm, 0.03 nm, 0.1 nm, 0.3 nm, 1 nm, 3 nm, 10 nm, and 100 nm) and 5
concentrations of melatonin (0.01 nm, 0.1 nm, 1 nm, 10 nm, and 100 nm) were used
for each mt1 or mt2 binding assay. non-speciﬁc binding was determined in the
presence of 10 mm melatonin. assays were initiated by the addition of membrane

homogenates and incubated for 60 min at 37  c. assays were terminated by rapid
ﬁltration onto whatman gf/b ﬁlters with a brandel cell harvester. filters were
washed 3 times with 4 ml ice-cold 20 mm tris containing 2 mm mgcl2, ph 7.4 at
25  c. bound radioactivity was quantitated by gamma emission spectrometry. data
were analyzed by a 4-parameter logistic, non-linear least squares regression
(delean et al., 1978) to yield ic50 values (concentration producing 50% of the
maximal effect), which were converted to dissociation constant for the inhibitor (ki)
values (cheng and prusoff, 1973).
in a second experiment, two lines of choek1 cells were used; one cell line
expressed the human  xxxg1476xxx  while the other expressed the human  xxxg1477xxx . radioligand binding assays were performed with 0.05 nm 2-[125i] xxxd2377xxx  used as the ligand, with a 4 h incubation at 25  c in 25 mm hepes, ph 7.4,
5 mm mgcl, 1 mm  xxxg2125xxx , 0.1% bsa. 6-chloromelatonin (1 mm) was used as nonspeciﬁc ligand. the reference compounds used for the mt1 or mt2 binding assays
were melatonin and 4-p-pdot, respectively; 4-p-pdot was used in this second
experiment because it was shown to have substantially higher afﬁnity for the mt2
receptor than for the  xxxg1476xxx  (browning et al., 2000). six concentrations of

 xxxd3294xxx  (0.1 nm, 0.3 nm, 1 nm, and 3 nm, 10 nm and 30 nm for mt1; 0.01 nm,
0.03 nm, 0.1 nm, 0.3 nm, 1 nm, and 3 nm for mt2) were used in triplicate batches,
with duplicate assays for each batch. ic50 values were determined by a non-linear,
least squares regression analysis using mathiq™ (id business solutions ltd., uk).
ki values were calculated according to the equation of cheng and prusoff (cheng and
prusoff, 1973) using the observed ic50 of the tested compound, the concentration of
radioligand employed in the assay, and the historical values for the dissociation
constant of the ligand (obtained experimentally at mds pharma services).
2.2.  xxxd1773xxx  assays
 xxxd1773xxx  assays were performed using nih-3t3 cells stably expressing human
mt1 or mt2 receptors. cells were incubated in culture media containing 1 mm  xxxd2388xxx 
and 10 mm  xxxd1742xxx  for 10 min at 37  c in the presence of increasing concentrations
(1 pme10 mm) of melatonin or  xxxd3294xxx . assays were terminated by the addition
of 0.1 n hcl. following centrifugation, supernatants were collected and stored
at 20  c until assayed.  xxxd1773xxx  levels were measured by radioimmunoassay

(amersham). radioactivity was quantitated by gamma emission spectrometry.
three separate experiments were performed in duplicate. data were analyzed by a
4-parameter logistic, non-linear least squares regression (delean et al., 1978) to
yield concentration producing 50% of the maximal effect (ec50) and maximal effect
(emax) values.
2.3. extended binding proﬁle
standard radioligand binding and enzyme inhibition assays were performed on
receptors, binding sites or enzyme systems obtained from various sources, including
human, rat, mouse, guinea pig, rabbit, hamster, and bovine tissues (see
supplemental information), using the proﬁlingscreen and discoveryscreen panels
(panlabs) which consisted of 56 radioligand binding assays and 7 enzyme assays,
respectively, and the spectrumscreen panel (mds pharma services) that included
170 pharmacological relevant targets (see supplemental information). in addition,
the gabaa benzodiazepine and gabab binding sites were also tested independently

(panlabs biochemical pharmacology assays).  xxxd3294xxx  was used at a concentration of 10 mm except for 2 enzyme assays (protein kinases c: pkca and  xxxg1838xxx ) where
it was used at 100 mm, and for the melatonin receptors in the spectrumscreen panel
where 4 concentrations (10 nm, 0.1 mm, 1 mm and 10 mm) were tested. a response
was considered signiﬁcant if there was 50% inhibition or stimulation for the assays.
the afﬁnity of  xxxd3294xxx  (10 mm) for the human  xxxg1031xxx 
expressed in transfected cho cells, and for the human  xxxg1032xxx 
expressed in transfected hek-293 cells, was determined in radioligand binding assays (euroﬁns cerep sa, celle l'evescault, france).

expressed in nih-3t3 cells. in this experiment,  xxxd3294xxx  displayed comparable potency to melatonin at the  xxxg1476xxx  and
stronger potency than melatonin (p < 0.05) at the  xxxg1477xxx 
(fig. 2). non-linear regression analysis of the data for the  xxxg1476xxx  yielded pki values (±standard error of the mean) of
9.39 ± 0.02 (ki ¼ 0.41 nm) for melatonin and pki ¼ 9.45 ± 0.04
(ki ¼ 0.35 nm) for  xxxd3294xxx  (table 1); for the  xxxg1477xxx  values
were pki ¼ 9.57 ± 0.03 (ki ¼ 0.27 nm) for melatonin and
pki ¼ 9.77 ± 0.07 (ki ¼ 0.17 nm) for  xxxd3294xxx  (table 1). analysis
of similar binding assays performed with choek1 cells conﬁrmed
a higher afﬁnity of  xxxd3294xxx  for the  xxxg1477xxx , with
ki ¼ 0.304 nm and ki ¼ 0.0692 ± 0.007 nm for mt1 and mt2
respectively (fig. 3, table 1). in choek1 cells, positive controls
melatonin and 4-p-pdot had ki values of 0.246 ± 0.039 nm and
0.273 ± 0.023 nm for mt1 and mt2, respectively. binding kinetics
were best ﬁt to a one-site binding model, suggesting a single receptor interaction. taken together, results indicate that  xxxd3294xxx 
is a dmra with 2.1e4.4 times greater afﬁnity for the  xxxg1477xxx 
than for the  xxxg1476xxx  (table 1). for melatonin, afﬁnity for the
 xxxg1477xxx  was 1.5 fold higher than for the  xxxg1476xxx  in nih3t3 cells.
 xxxd3294xxx  was shown to induce a potent, concentrationdependent inhibition of  xxxd1742xxx -stimulated camp accumulation
in nih-3t3 cells stably expressing human mt1 (pec50 ¼ 9.1 ± 0.1,
ec50 ¼ 0.74 nm, and emax ¼ 59 ± 1%) or expressing human mt2
(pec50 ¼ 9.0 ± 0.1, ec50 ¼ 0.1 nm, and emax ¼ 60 ± 3%) receptors
(fig. 4).
no signiﬁcant responses (50% inhibition or stimulation) were
observed in any radioligand receptor binding assay (table 2) and
enzyme assays (table 3), except for both melatonin receptors mt1
and mt2 assays for which approximately 100% inhibition was
achieved  xxxd1891xxx  nm. because of overlaps between the proﬁlingscreen
and discoveryscreen panels (panlabs) and the spectrumscreen
panel (mds pharma services) forty two receptors were tested
twice, in some cases with a different assay (i.e. different ligand or
different source of receptor); results were consistent in all cases,
showing no signiﬁcant binding afﬁnity for these receptors.
4. discussion and conclusions
 xxxd3294xxx  was shown to have full agonist activity at both
melatonin receptors, with greater afﬁnity for the  xxxg1477xxx  as
compared to the  xxxg1476xxx  in 2 independent experiments
where the human melatonin receptors were expressed in different
cell lines. the ki values of  xxxd3294xxx  showed numerical differences between cell lines for each melatonin receptor, and between
melatonin receptors for each cell line, but remained within the
same order of magnitude (table 1). such differences are not unexpected for studies with different experimental conditions and
may be due to variations in cellular environment (nelson and
challiss, 2007), receptor reserve (zhu, 1993) or receptor expression and coupling (luttrell, 2006), which can affect the ki estimation (van et al., 1997). results were consistent across experiments

in demonstrating the binding afﬁnity of  xxxd3294xxx  for both
melatonin receptors, and in indicating a higher mt1/mt2 ki ratio.
mt1 and mt2 melatonin receptors are present in several areas of
the central nervous system, including the scn, the pars tuberalis,
and the retina, as well as in peripheral tissues such as kidney,
pancreas, testes, adrenal cortex, and the immune and cardiovascular systems (dubocovich and markowska, 2005). the  xxxg1476xxx  has been implicated in the modulation of neuronal ﬁring
(liu et al, 1997; jin et al, 2003), cardiac vessel constriction (krause
et al., 1995), reproductive functions (johnston et al., 2003a;
johnston et al, 2003b), and metabolic functions (peschke, 2008;
kemp et al., 2002). the  xxxg1477xxx  is believed to mediate circadian rhythm phase-shifting (liu et al, 1997; dubocovich et al., 1998,
2005; hunt et al., 2001), and was recently implicated in the regulation of sleep (ochoa-sanchez et al, 2011).
while the binding afﬁnity of  xxxd3294xxx  for the melatonin receptors has not been determined in vivo, the clinical effects of
 xxxd3294xxx  are consistent with the results of the in vitro experiments.  xxxd3294xxx  has demonstrated the ability to phase-advance
the sleep-wake cycle and improve nighttime sleep and daytime
sleep (lockley et al., 2013a, 2013b; rajaratnam et al, 2009; torres
et al., 2014).  xxxd3294xxx  has also demonstrated its ability to
phase-advance and entrain the scn as measured by the circadian
rhythm proﬁle of the hormones melatonin and cortisol (lockley
et al, 2013a, 2013b; rajaratnam et al, 2009).
 xxxd3294xxx  had no signiﬁcant interaction with any other
commonly screened receptors or enzyme binding sites tested,
including a wide array of receptors of neurotransmitter systems
such as dopamine, norepinephrine, serotonin, gaba, acetylcholine,
opioid, n-methyl-d-aspartate (nmda), hypocretin (orexin), and
cannabinoid; this ﬁnding supports the observation that  xxxd3294xxx  did not produce signs or symptoms indicative of abuse
potential in animal or clinical studies and did not produce withdrawal symptoms after discontinuation of chronic administration
( xxxd3294xxx ® prescribing information: https://www. xxxd3294xxx .com,
accessed aug 27, 2014).
 xxxd3294xxx 's receptor binding proﬁle is distinct from that of
two other molecules known to bind both melatonin receptors,
 xxxd3078xxx  and  xxxd95xxx ;  xxxd3078xxx  has 8 times lower afﬁnity
for the  xxxg1477xxx  than for the  xxxg1476xxx  (kato et al, 2005),
and  xxxd95xxx , a non-speciﬁc melatonin agonist, has a 4.4 times
lower afﬁnity for the  xxxg1477xxx  than for the  xxxg1476xxx  and
binds also to several serotonin 5-ht2 receptors (millan et al, 2003;
bourin et al., 2004).
the selective and unique receptor binding proﬁle of  xxxd3294xxx 
supports its pharmacological properties as a circadian regulator
including in particular its ability to phase advance and entrain
circadian rhythms as demonstrated in healthy volunteers
(rajaratnam et al, 2009) and in patients with non-24 (lockley et al,
2013a), which leads to improvement in sleep-wake measures and
global function in patients affected with non-24 (lockley et al,
2013a, 2013b; torres et al., 2014) .
