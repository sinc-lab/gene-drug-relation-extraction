signal transduction
of two mitogens
for pancreatic
p-cells, gh and
prl, was investigated
using the differentiated
insulin-secreting

hgh, bovine gh
(bgh),
and prl also stimulated
[“hlthymidine

dose-dependent
manner
(1 pm-1 nm).
hgh induced
cytosolic

with bgh or prl. hgh

of the cells
(~25% ) as detected
by cell-attached
patch-clamp
analysis.
however,

t

he precise mechanisms
regulating
proliferation
and
differentiated
function of insulin-secreting
cells are still
unknown.
a variety of factors including
nutrients,
hormones, growth
factors, and chemical agents have been reported to elicit mitogenic
effects on pancreatic
p-cells (1, 2).
the peptide hormones that belong to the gh family, namely
gh, prl, and placental
lactogen, are of particular
interest
(3-6) and are assumed to play an important
role in situations
where the p-cell mass is increased, such as pregnancy
(6, 7)
and tumoral
hypersecretion
of gh or prl (8). moreover,
these hormones
are believed to be implicated
in the functional maturation
of p-cells (9, 10). however,
the signaling
mechanisms
of these p-cell mitogens are only partially
understood. such information
should provide insight into the
main physiological
mechanisms
regulating
p-cell growth
and differentiated
function.
receptors for both gh and prl belong to the cytokine/
hematopoietic
growth factor receptor family that comprises
receptors for a number of interleukins
(ils 2-7,9-ll),
erythropoietin,
colony stimulating
factors, and other trophic sub-

involvement
of camp is suggested
because rp-cyclic
adenosine-3’,5’monophosphorothioate,
a competitive
inhibitor
of protein
kinase a,
abolished
hgh-induced
[ca’
i, rises and dna synthesis.
camp appears to play a permissive
role, although
hgh failed to raise cellular
camp levels.
these results
support
the idea that activation
of jak2 is a major
signaling
event, whkieas
the [ca’ ’ i, rise is not a prerequisite,
for the
mitogenic
effects of gh and prl in insulin-secreting
cells. (endocrino1og.y 13’7: 1841-1850,
1996)

stances (11). recent investigations
revealed that a family of
nonreceptor
tyrosine kinases, jak-tyk kinases, is associated
with the cytokine
postreceptor
signaling
(12, 13). in fact,
many of the members of the cytokine receptor family (13),
including
gh (14) and prl (15), induce tyrosine phosphorylation, and subsequently
activation,
of jak2  xxxg2198xxx . moreover,
expression
of a kinase-deficient
form of
jak2 has been shown to abrogate
erythropoietin-induced
mitogenesis
(16). it has, however,
not been proven whether
jak2 activation
is sufficient for the mitogenic
action of gh.
other signaling
mechanisms
have also been reported
for
the effects of gh (17) and prl (18 and references therein).
these include the rise in cytosolic ca’ ’ ([ca’ ’ i,) (18, 19), the
stimulation
of g protein-coupled
mechanisms
(17) and of the
mitogen-activated
protein (map) kinase pathway
(20, 21),
the production
of diacylglycerol,
and the tyrosine phosphorylation of various proteins (17). it is of interest that a prolinerich juxta-membrane
cytosolic domain
of the  xxxg890xxx 
has been implicated
in the activation
of both jak2 and the
map kinase pathway
(22, 23), and its deletion
leads to the
selective loss of gh stimulation
of mitogenesis
(24).
recently,
a differentiated
insulinoma
cell line, ins-l,
which was established
by our group (25), has been reported
to express a high number of receptors with ligand affinity for
human gh (hgh) comparable
to that of rat hepatocytes
(26).
hgh binds to both somatogenic
and lactogenic
receptors
expressed in this cell line, although
the majority of the hgh
binding
sites are of lactogenic specificity
(26). we have ob-

gh and prl signaling

served that prl stimulates
[“hlthymidine
incorporation
and
cell proliferation
in ins-l cells (27). however,
prl failed to
stimulate the map kinase pathway (27), suggesting
that mitogenesis may be activated through the jak kinase pathway
in these cells. furthermore,
nerve growth
factor, a potent
activator
of the map
kinase cascade, did not enhance
[“hlthymidine
incorporation,
whereas
glucose
increased
both map kinase activity and dna synthesis (27). therefore,
map kinase activity does not correlate with mitogenesis
in
insulin-secreting
cells.
in the present study, we investigated
the role of tyrosine
phosphorylation
of jak2 and whether changes in [ca’ ’ 1, are
implicated
in the mitogenic
effects of gh and prl in ins-l
cells.

in the range 1 pm to 1 nm, and saturating

to bind to both somatogenic

ins-l cells (26).

insulin content was similar in the cells cultured in the absence
or presence of  xxxd2488xxx  or prl. however,
after 7 days, cellular
insulin content significantly
decreased in the cells cultured
without hgh or prl, whereas the presence of either hormone
was able to maintain the insulin content (table 1). in the cells
cultured with hgh or prl, nutrient metabolism
as reflected by
mtt reduction (29) expressed per dna was also higher relative
to control cells (table 1).

(33), also almost completely blocked the effect of hgh (fig.
2e). similarly, bgh raised [ca”], from 125 + 16 to 495 +- 50
nm (8 out of 8 cells, fig. 21), and this effect was reversibly
abolished by calciseptine (fig. 21). in addition, calciseptine
markedly inhibited the 30 mm k’-induced
[ca”], rise in
ins-l cells (data not shown).
increases in camp levels raise [ca”], both in normal
p-cells and in ins-l cells (27). therefore, the possibility that
camp generation is involved in the effect of the hormones
was investigated next. pretreatment of the cells for 5 min
with 1 mm rp-camps, a competitive inhibitor of camp
activation of  xxxg1836xxx  (34), abolished hgh-induced
but not glucose-evoked [ca’+], rises (fig. 2f). rp-camps
alone, however, raised [ xxxg293xxx ’li to a similar extent as gh. it
was therefore important to perform control experiments with
a hormone known to act through the generation of camp
levels. the insulin-secretagogue, glp-1, belongs to this category of hormones (35). glp-1 (1 nm) caused a transient
increase in [ xxxg293xxx  ‘ii, which was blocked by rp-camps (fig.
2g). because verapamil blocked the action of hgh, which
suggests involvement of voltage-gated ca’ ’ -channels, we
also tested the hyperpolarizing agent,  xxxd1868xxx , which acts
by opening atp-sensitive k+-channels (25). in the presence
of 200 fm  xxxd1868xxx , the ca’+-raising effect of hgh was no
longer observed (fig. 2h).
effects of hgh on membrane

potential

in ins-l

cells

to elucidate whether [ca’ ‘ii rises caused by hgh were
secondary to membrane depolarization, we measured membrane potential by two different methods. first, electrophys-

in a p-cell line
iological studies were performed using the patch-clamp technique in the attached cell mode. the cells (n = 25) had a
resting potential of -61 + 2 mv, which depolarizes in response to 15 mm glucose (fig. 3a). at 3 mm glucose, addition
of 5 nm hgh induced depolarization and action potentials in
3 out of 13 cells (fig. 38). the hgh unresponsive cells displayed glucose sensitivity (data not shown). al 15 mm glucose, hgh had no effect on action potentials already induced
by glucose (17= 3, data not shown). hgh (5 ijm) had no effect
when tested in the whole cell configuration (n = 9, data not
shown). the effect of hgh on membrane potential was also
evaluated in ins-1 cell populations with a fluorescent probe,
bisoxonol. with this method, no change was observed after
the addition of hgh at 3 mm glucose, whereas 15 mm glucose
caused membrane depolarization (fig. 3c).  xxxd1868xxx  (200
pm)
hyperpolarized and 30 mm k’ depolarized the membrane potential, attesting the feasibility of monitoring this
parameter in a semiquantitative manner in attached cells.

on camp levels in ins-l

cells

hgi i(5 iim) did not significantly alter cellular camp levels
after 5-min incubation at 3 mm glucose (control, 26.2 5 1.2
~1s.hgh, 27.9 + 1.2 pmol/lo” cells). incubation with 15 mm
glucose did not affect camp levels (29.1 + 1 .o pmol/ 10”
cells), whereas 1 pm  xxxd1742xxx  raised camp levels 3.7-fold
(96.2 i- 4.9 pmol/lo” cells).
effects of hgh
ins-l cells

and prl on insulin

secretion

from

the [ca’ ’ ],-raising actions of hgh and prl prompted us
to examine their effects on acute insulin secretion because a
rise of [ca”], is a key signaling event in the secretory process
(36). in perifused ins-l cells, 15 mm glucose caused a more
than 3-fold stimulation of insulin secretion (fig. 4). however,
hgh failed to stimulate acute insulin secretion, but rather
lowered the basal level in the presence of 3 mm glucose
(cumulated secretion over 15 min, from 0.365 5 0.040 to 0.237
+ 0.023%
of content,
p < 0.01; ii = 4) (fig. 4). the stimulatory
effect of 15 mm glucose was not enhanced by hgh. on the
contrary, after discontinuation of the stimuli, there was an
“off” response in the group exposed to the combination of 15
mm glucose and hgh (0.504 + 0.043 us.0.364 ? 0.036% of
content, cumulated secretion over 5 min after discontinuation of the stimuli, 15 mm glucose plus hgh ~1s.15 mm
glucose alone, 17< 0.05; n = 4) (fig. 4). neither 5 iim hgh nor
5 nm prl affected insulin secretion monitored under static
conditions at nonstimulatory (3 mm) or stimulatory (7 and 15
mm) glucose concentrations
(data not shown).

in the present study, the signaling
mechanisms
mediating
the mitogenic
effect of gh and prl in insulin-secreting
cells
were investigated
using ins-1 cells, which retain many characteristics
of native p-cells (25, 29). these cells express receptors for both gh and prl (26). as hgh binds to both
somatogenic
and lactogenic
receptors (32), bgh, which specifically binds to somatogenic
receptors,
was also tested.
hgh and prl maintained
viability,
growth,
and cellular
insulin content of ins-l cells cultured in the serum-substitute
medium.
both hormones
increased
mtt reduction,
which
reflects the generation
of reducing
equivalents
during nutrient metabolism
(29) in agreement
with the reported stimulation of glucose oxidation
in neonatal islets by prl (38).
thus ins-l cells respond like normal p-cells after exposure
to these hormones
(4-6, 9).
the dose-response
characteristics
for hgh-, bgh-, and
prl-stimulated
[3h]thymidine
incorporation
in ins-l cells
were comparable
and show that these actions are exerted in
the physiological
hormone
concentration
range (39). bgh
and prl appear to share common
postreceptor
signaling
events in mitogenesis,
as their effects were not additive.
little is known
about the postreceptor
signaling
mechanisms of gh and prl in insulin-secreting
cells. hgh, bgh,
and prl all caused a marked but transient
[ca”li
rise in
single ins-l cells. with respect to hgh, our findings
are
consistent with those reported recently in cho cells expressing wild-type
gh receptors and in the insulin-secreting
cell
line rin 5ah (19), and with preliminary
results in fetal rat
islet cells (40). the [ca’ ‘i, rise elicited by hgh is due to ca’+

further supported by the use of  xxxd1868xxx , which abolished
the [ca*+], response. however, only a fraction of the cells
exposed to hgh showed a small membrane depolarization
in the patch-clamp analysis, whereas no detectable change in
membrane potential was observed with bisoxonol in cell
populations. nonetheless, the hgh-induced
membrane depolarization and  xxxg293xxx + action potential detected by the patchclamp analysis were observed with delays compatible with
those recorded for the ca’+-raising
effect. therefore, membrane depolarization
may participate in the gh- or prlinduced ca*+-influx
and would exert a permissive role
because hyperpolarization
counteracts the hormonal effect.

gh and prl signaling

considering
that the onset of the rise in [ca’ ‘1, is relatively
slow (30-45 set lag), it is unlikely
that receptor-mediated
activation
of phospholipase
c is involved.
the strict dependence on ca’ ’ -influx also indicates that gh and prl do not
generate
the ca’ ’ -mobilizing
messenger
inositol
1,4,5trisphosphate.
an increase in camp levels could explain the
[ca’ ’ ], rise because glp-1 (fig. 2),  xxxd1742xxx 
and chlorophenylthio-camp
(ut-camp)
(27) all raise [ca’ ‘ii with similar
kinetics in ins-l cells. camp, by activation of protein kinase
a, could cause phosphorylation
of the (y, and /3 subunits of
l-type ca’ ’ -channels,
as demonstrated
in other cell types
(41). alternatively,
camp generation
could promote
membrane
depolarization
(42).
after
pretreatment
with
rp-camps, the effects of hgh and glp-1 on [ca’ ’ 1, were no
longer observed, suggesting
the involvement
of camp in the
[ca”],
rise. the inhibition
by rp-camps
is not due to a
nonspecific
effect because rp-camps
did not block the glucose-induced
[ca’ ’ ii rise. however,
measurement
of intracellular camp levels did not reveal any increase in response
to hgh. the involvement
of camp in hgh action can thus
not be substantiated.
the rise in camp levels might only be
transient and escape detection under our experimental
conditions. it is of interest in this context that, in leydig cells,
activation of a camp-mediated
pathway can occur after stimulation
with lh and hcg without
detectable
changes in
intracellular
camp levels (43). further studies are required
to clarify the role of camp in gh signaling.
taken together,
our results are compatible
with an effect of hgh on the gating
of l-type ca’ ’ -channels,
requiring
permissive
membrane
potential
levels, but not necessarily
involving
membrane
depolarization.
the evidence that hgh is capable of raising [ca*‘], and,
possibly, activating  xxxg1836xxx  suggested that hgh might
stimulate insulin secretion because these two signaling events
are known to augment exocytosis of insulin (44,45). however,
hgh failed to stimulate both basal and glucose-induced
insulin
secretion in perifused ins-l cells. rather, the presence of an
inhibitory
influence on insulin secretion was suggested, as the
basal secretion was lowered by hgh, and an “off” response was
observed by the simultaneous
removal of hgh and high glucose. it may be speculated that hgh exerts two opposing (stimulatory and inhibitory)
effects in ins-l cells.
much evidence has been obtained
for the crucial role of
ca’ ’ in the mitogenesis
of many cell types (46). however,
in
ins-l cells both verapamil
and  xxxd1868xxx ,
which blocked the
hgh-induced
[ca’ ’ 1, rise, failed to inhibit dna synthesis
stimulated
by hgh during the 6-h incubation.
these observations indicate that the rise in [cazili is not a prerequisite
for the mitogenic
effects of hgh and prl. the nonspecific
inhibition
of hgh- and prl-induced
dna synthesis by verapamil after 24 h has also been reported
in rat lymphoma
cells, in which the prl stimulation
is indeed not dependent
on extracellular
ca” (47).
nonetheless, the rise in [ca’ ’ 1, has been implicated
in some
other effects of gh and prl. for example, it has recently been
shown that, in cho cells expressing
mutant gh receptors
lacking the c-terminal
domains, which are distinct from those
required for jak2 activation, ch promotes neither [ca* ’ ii elevation nor spi 2.1 gene transcription
(19). in the same report,
verapamil (at a concentration
10 times that used in our study)

in a p-cell

line

endo.

1996

vol 137 . no ,5

was shown to inhibit both [ca”], rise and insulin transcription
induced by gh in rin 5ah cells. these findings suggest that
gh stimulates a ca’ ’ -dependent
pathway that leads to transcription of some genes including
insulin (19). it is thus possible
that the effects of gh and prl on the differentiated
function of
insulin-secreting
cells, such as the regulation
of insulin biosynthesis, require a [ca” ii rise.
tyrosine phosphorylation
is a well-known
mechanism
implicated in signaling
events of many hormones,
growth factors (48) and cytokines (ll), but information
on its role in
p-cell growth
is limited
(27, 49, 50). immunoblotting
with
antiphosphotyrosine
antibodies
revealed that hgh, bgh,
and prl promoted
tyrosine phosphorylation
of several proteins in ins-i cells. one of these was identified
as jak2
tyrosine
kinase by immunoprecipitation,
which confirms
previous
reports in other cell types (14, 15, 22). although
activation of jak2 has already been shown in rin-5ah
ceils
transfected
with an exogenous
liver-type
 xxxg890xxx  (22),
the finding
obtained
in ins-l cells that express abundant
intrinsic
gh receptors (26) strongly suggests that the jak2
 xxxg2198xxx  pathway
is implicated
in the mitogenic
effects of gh and prl in native p-cells. its presence has recently been demonstrated
by immunohistochemical
techniques in the nucleus of rat p-cells (51). in this context, it will
be of interest to investigate
whether
the other proteins
of
approximately
90 and 85 kda, which are also phosphorylated
by the stimulation
with gh and prl, are the transcription
factors stat (signal transducers
and activators
of transcription)
proteins (12,13). at least three stat proteins have
been reported to be involved
in gh signaling
events (21, 52,
53). lavendustin
a abolished
hgh-stimulated
dna synthesis, further supporting
the idea that tyrosine phosphorylation cascades play a pivotal role in the mitogenic effect of gh.
studies with mutated gh receptors have shown that the
proline-rich
juxta-membrane
domain
is required
for both
jak2 and map kinase activation
(23). however, the absence
of map kinase activation
by hgh or prl in ins-l cells (27)
indicates
that, at least in insulin-secreting
cells, the map
kinase pathway is not involved in the mitogenic
action of the
two hormones.
a similar dissociation
of map kinase activation from stimulation
of mitogenesis
has been reported for
the effects of erythropoietin
on a bone marrow cell line (54).
the inhibition
of hgh-induced
dna synthesis by rpcamps suggests that the basal activity of the camp pathway
may be permissive
to hgh-mediated
mitogenesis,
whereas
agents that raise cellular
camp levels have been reported
both to increase and to decrease p-cell proliferation
(27, 55).
in contrast to the effects of gh or prl, 10% fcs failed to
stimulate
jak2 phosphorylation,
suggesting
that the mitogenie activity in fcs in this case is due neither to gh nor to
prl. glucose, which also stimulates dna synthesis in ins-l
cells, did not promote jak2 tyrosine phosphorylation.
moreover, treatment
with lavendustin
a did not affect the glucose-stimulated
dna synthesis. these results suggest that
the mechanisms
underlying
the mitogenic
effects of glucose
and fcs are different from those of gh and prl. it remains
to be clarified
whether
the mitogenic
effects of glucose or
fcs, both of which activate map kinase in ins-1 cells (27),
are indeed mediated
by this pathway.
in conclusion,

gh and

prl signaling

prl, also stimulate replication
of ins-l cells within the physiological
concentration
range. among the postreceptor
signaling cascades of these hormones,
protein tyrosine phosphorylation,
especially
that of jak2, is a major event, in
contrast to an increase in [ca’+],, which is not required
for
the stimulation
of mitogenesis.
