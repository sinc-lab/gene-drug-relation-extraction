using lidocaine and  xxxd305xxx  to link sodium channel
molecular conformations to state-dependent
antiarrhythmic drug affinity

rationale: lidocaine and other antiarrhythmic drugs bind in the inner pore of voltage-gated na channels and affect
gating use-dependently. a phenylalanine in domain iv, s6 (phe1759 in  xxxg2028xxx ), modeled to face the inner pore
just below the selectivity filter, is critical in use-dependent drug block.
objective: measurement of gating currents and concentration-dependent availability curves to determine the role
of phe1759 in coupling of drug binding to the gating changes.
methods and results: the measurements showed that replacement of phe1759 with a nonaromatic residue permits
clear separation of action of lidocaine and  xxxd305xxx  into 2 components that can be related to channel
conformations. one component represents the drug acting as a voltage-independent, low-affinity blocker of
closed channels (designated as lipophilic block), and the second represents high-affinity, voltage-dependent block
of open/inactivated channels linked to stabilization of the s4s in domains iii and iv (designated as voltage-sensor
inhibition) by phe1759. a homology model for how lidocaine and  xxxd305xxx  bind in the closed and
open/inactivated channel conformation is proposed.
conclusions: these 2 components, lipophilic block and voltage-sensor inhibition, can explain the differences in
estimates between tonic and open-state/inactivated-state affinities, and they identify how differences in affinity
for the 2 binding conformations can control use-dependence, the hallmark of successful antiarrhythmic drugs. (circ

idocaine and other local anesthetic (la) drugs block
voltage gated na channels. a subset share characteristics
that make them effective as antiarrhythmic drugs, ie, they
exhibit high affinity, use-dependent block of na current (ina)
at high heart rates. despite extensive study, there remains
uncertainty regarding how observed block relates to specific
drug– channel conformations. several vocabularies have
emerged to describe block, which in general, have their basis
in kinetic models of na channel gating and assume preferential binding to one or more states that produce no1 or altered2
gating. recent availability of crystal structures in combination with mutagenesis data now allow for linking electrophysiological data, kinetic states, and drug block to specific
channel conformations.
it is generally accepted that lidocaine and lidocaine-like
drugs bind in the inner pore of voltage-gated na channels.
scanning mutagenesis studies with various na channel isoforms and multiple lidocaine-like drugs have identified only
one amino acid residue, a phenylalanine (phe) in domain iv,

s6 (divs6), which, when mutated, alters use-dependent drug
affinity by more than ten-fold. when this phe (1759 in
 xxxg2028xxx ) is mutated to nonaromatic residues3– 8 or to unnatural
amino acids with different electron withdrawing capabilities9
the mutated channel shows a marked decrease in high-affinity
la block. homology modeling with k channels predicts that
this phe faces the pore just below the selectivity filter.10,11
this orientation of phe is supported by the finding that its
cysteine mutant is accessible to mts reagents applied from
inside the pore when the channel is maintained in an open
state.12 furthermore, it has been shown by us13 and others14
that use-dependent block is intimately associated with altered
movements of the structurally distant s4 segments in domains
iii and iv.
block assayed from negative holding potentials at low
rates of stimulation is affected very little by channel mutations in contract to their effects on use-dependent block. this
lower affinity block is usually called tonic block, although it
has also been called rested-state block (or closed-state block)

conformational changes and local anesthetic binding

when it occurs from holding potentials that bias na channels
to be fully available, ie, they occupy rested/closed states.
however, as the membrane potential becomes more depolarized tonic block also increases, ie, it is voltage-dependent.15
in these experiments, we show that drug binding to
divs6-phe1759 induces changes in gating currents, which
are the hallmark of high-affinity, voltage dependent block.16
experiments with ionic currents and with gating currents
allowed separation of block by antiarrhythmic drugs into 2
components. one represents a voltage-independent, lowaffinity block that likely results from interaction of drug with
channels in the closed conformation, which we term lipophilic block reflecting that it represents a neutral form of
the drug interacting with neutral residues in the closed
channel pore. the second is one that is associated with
modification of gating currents and the open/inactivated
conformation. we designate this voltage-sensor inhibition to
reflect this important consequence of binding. these 2 forms
of block provide a straight-forward method for interpreting
ionic current data and for modeling of the drug interaction
sites. part of this work has been published in abstract form.17

methods

experiments used the human heart voltage-gated na⫹ channel,
 xxxg2028xxx  (hh1a), provided by h. hartmann (university of maryland
biotechnology institute, baltimore, md) and a. brown (chantest
inc, cleveland, ohio).18 channels were expressed transiently in
tsa201 cells or stably in hek293 cell lines. for gating current (ig)
studies, the background for all channels included c373y, which
increases sensitivity to saxitoxin19 and exerts minimal effects on
channel kinetics or on local anesthetic action.5 cells were maintained
in dmem (invitrogen, carlsbad, calif) supplemented with 10%
fbs, 1% penicillin-streptomycin, and selection antibiotic in 60- to
100-mm culture dishes (corning, acton, mass). for ig experiments,
multiple tsa201 cells were fused using  xxxd2982xxx  to form
large single cells, cultured for several days to allow for membrane
remodeling, and then transiently transfected using calcium
phosphate (invitrogen).
for standard ina measurements, extracellular na⫹ was lowered
and replaced with cs⫹ to maintain peak inward currents ⬇1 to 3 na.
bath solution contained (in mmol/l): 2 to 50 nacl, 138 to 90 cscl,
10 hepes, 2 cacl2, ph 7.4 with csoh. pipette solution contained
(in mmol/l): 100 csf, 45 cscl, 10 egta, and 10 hepes, ph 7.4
with csoh. for ig experiments, the control extracellular solution for
ina measurements contained: 15 mmol/l 2-(n-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid sodium salt (na-mes), 185 mmol/l tetramethyl
ammonium (tma)-mes, 2 mmol/l ca(oh)2, and 10 mmol/l
hepes (ph 7.2). intracellular solution contained 200 tma⫹, 75 f⫺,
125 mes⫺, 10 egta, and 10 hepes (ph 7.2). tma, mes, and
4 mmol/l ca were used because they minimized ina and leak
currents, whereas hypertonicity compensated for their lower conductivity. for measurements of ig na⫹ was replaced with tma⫹ and
1.0 ␮mol/l saxitoxin (calbiochem corp, san diego, calif) and
2 mmol/l ca(oh)2 were added to the extracellular solution. lidocaine and  xxxd305xxx  (sigma-aldrich, st louis, mo) were dissolved
in bath solution and applied using either a single chamber bath in
which solutions were exchanged using a latching subminiature
solenoid valve (the lee company, westbrook, conn) or a multichamber bath in which cells sealed to the patch pipette were lifted
and moved from chamber to chamber to measure currents in the
absence and presence of drug.
whole cell ionic current recordings were made with an axopatch
200b amplifier and a digidata 1321a with pclamp 8.2 (axon
instruments, union city, calif) as previously described.5 ig recordings were made with a large bore, double-barreled glass suction
pipette. ig data were obtained using a national instruments pxi-1002

with a pxi-6052 multi-function 16-bit converter using labview 7.0
(national instruments corp, austin, tex), filtered by the head stage
(⬇100 khz), and digitized at 200 khz. for ig measurements, the
membrane potential was held at ⫺150 mv and stepped to various
test potentials for 26.5 ms at 0.5 hz at room temperature. all ig were
leak corrected by the mean of 2 to 4 ms of data usually beginning 8
ms after the change in test potential and capacity corrected using 4
to 8 scaled current responses to steps between ⫺150 and ⫺180 mv
taken immediately before and after test steps.
data were analyzed using matlab (the mathworks inc, natick,
mass) and origin (originlab corp, northampton, mass). there
were no differences in parameter estimation for fitting using these
programs even though the nonlinear regression technique differs
between them. voltage-dependent availability curves were fit with a
boltzmann relationship: i/imax⫽1/(1⫹exp((vt⫺v1/2)/dx)), where i is
the ina during a step depolarization to the test potential, vt, that
typically was ⫺10 to ⫺30 mv after conditioning for 1000 ms at
various potentials (mv) with 4 or 5 seconds between trials. the fitted
parameters were: the maximal current (imax), the half-point of the
relationship (v1/2), and the slope factor of the relationship (dx). the
same relationship was used for charge; slope factors had opposite
sign. for concentration–response analyses, data were normalized to
peak ina in control, and these were fit with a single-site binding
equation: fraction remaining⫽1/(1⫹[drug]/ed50), where ed50 represents the drug concentration at which one-half ina is blocked. ed50
values are reported as the estimate and standard error of the estimate
from the fits. for analysis of populations, parameters from individual
fits were meaned and grouped data are reported as means⫾sem for
each parameter. differences between parameters were assessed using
paired t tests. parameters were considered significant when p⬍0.05.

results
use-dependent lidocaine block is associated
with voltage sensors
mutations of phe1759 in  xxxg2028xxx  have been shown to eliminate use-dependent block of ina by lidocaine.5,9 in addition,
we have previously shown that high-affinity block of na
channels by lidocaine is associated with a characteristic set
of changes in the gating charge–voltage (q-v) relationship.17 in the presence of high concentrations of lidocaine
(figure 1a), which ensures that nearly all na channels are
bound to drug, q-v relationships demonstrate a smaller
maximal gating charge (qmax), less dependence of charge
on potential, a negative shift in the half-point (v1/2), and
the presence of additional charge at more negative potentials. these signature changes result from stabilization of
the diiis4 in a depolarized position and partial inhibition
of movement of divs4 with an alteration of its voltage
dependence.13,14,16 we term this complex set of changes
voltage-sensor inhibition. the magnitudes of these
changes with lidocaine are concentration-dependent and
proportional to the magnitude of use-dependent block of

from the boltzmann fits to the q-v relationships of the individual
cell in control solution (䡺) was used to normalize the qmax in
lidocaine (œ) and after wash (e). the protocols were performed

from ⫺67⫾4 mv to ⫺80⫾5 mv, and the slope factor flattened
(⫺12⫾3 mv to ⫺20⫾3 mv). all changes were significant at
p⬍0.05. the inset shows that ig was decreased in drug. b, for
f1759k channels (n⫽4 cells) in lidocaine qmax was 0.99⫾0.01

(13⫾1 mv in both groups). v1/2 was significantly shifted from

superimposed.

ina as expected if both effects resulted from the same
binding event with an ed50 in the 20 ␮mol/l range,
comparable to that found for high-affinity lidocaine block
of ina.15
if use-dependent block of ina by lidocaine is obligatorily
linked to these signature changes in the q-v relationship,
then the absence of use-dependent block by lidocaine in the
f1759k channel5 should be associated with the loss of these
signature changes. figure 1b shows this to be the case. in the
presence of 10 mmol/l lidocaine, a concentration that tonically blocked ⬇80% of ina (data not shown), neither qmax nor
the slope factor was reduced although v1/2 was slightly, and
reversibly, shifted leftward. these results suggest that drug
interaction with phe1759 is required to produce the signature
changes in the q-v relationship associated with usedependent block.

conformational changes and local anesthetic binding

studies with the neutral drug  xxxd305xxx 
at the physiological ph of 7.4 lidocaine molecules are mostly
charged, and the positively charged tertiary amine is thought
to interact strongly with phe1759.3,5,6,9 in contrast,  xxxd305xxx  is neutral and produces little or no use-dependent
block.2,20,21 however,  xxxd305xxx  has been shown to shift the
v1/2 of the steady-state availability curve leftward2 and to
reduce gating charge16,22,23 suggesting that  xxxd305xxx  actions are similar to lidocaine even though it shows no
use-dependence. although exposure to 2 mmol/l  xxxd305xxx 
(close to the maximal amount soluble in water at room
temperature) did not completely block all ina, it was able to
produce signature changes in gating currents in wt (figure
3a) similar in kind, but lesser in magnitude, to those in
lidocaine. in contrast, 2 mmol/l  xxxd305xxx  had minimal
effects on the q-v relationship of f1759k except for a small
leftward shift in the v1/2 of 7 mv (also seen with lidocaine),
which was reversible on washout of the drug (figure 3b).
if  xxxd305xxx  can produce voltage-sensor inhibition in wt
then it should also cause large leftward shifts in the v1/2 of the
steady-state availability curves. figure 4a shows this was the
case for wt channels where  xxxd305xxx  produced a large,
concentration-dependent leftward shift of v1/2 (figure 4a) as
well as a reduction in imax with an ed50 of 0.32 mmol/l
(figure 4a, inset). in contrast,  xxxd305xxx  had minimal
effects on v1/2 of availability of f1759k; it produced only a
small leftward shift (figure 4b), which was similar in
magnitude to that seen for its q-v relationship in lidocaine
(see figure 3b). the ed50 calculated from the availability
asymptotes in f1759k was 0.66 mmol/l (figure 4b, inset). if
this represents only lipophilic block, then the 2-fold smaller

independent block by lidocaine, we constructed steady-state
voltage-dependent na channel availability as a function of
lidocaine concentration. it has long been appreciated that the
v1/2 of na channel availability in wild-type (wt) channels
shifts leftward in the presence of lidocaine 2 in a
concentration-dependent manner (figure 2b). although ina
in f1759k was reduced in a concentration-dependent manner, ie, asymptotes were dose-dependently reduced (figure
2c, inset), there was only a very small concentrationdependent shift in availability half-point (figure 2c). note
that all curves have nearly identical v1/2 values. similar to
what was found for the q-v relationships for f1759k in
lidocaine (figure 1c), there was a small leftward shift in v1/2.
to distinguish this essentially voltage-independent block
from use-dependent block associated with voltage-sensor
inhibition, we introduce the term lipophilic block. we choose
this term to emphasize its voltage independent behavior,
although it likely represents the same affinity observed in the
first depolarization after exposing cells to drug while holding
at a very negative potential (ie, first pulse block, see discussion). the greater block of ina in wt compared to f1759k
(figure 2), when the holding potential is ⫺150 mv (a fully
available potential in the absence of drug) suggests that tonic
block in wt channels arises from a combination of both
voltage-sensor inhibition and lipophilic block, whereas
f1759k demonstrates only lipophilic block.

nents from both lipophilic block and voltage-sensor inhibition. it should be recognized that the shift in the v1/2 of
voltage-dependent na channel availability in wt results from
greater voltage-sensor inhibition as the membrane potential
becomes depolarized.

homology model of inner-pore na channel
interactions with drugs that produce
lipophilic block
to consider how voltage sensor-independent block might be
produced by lidocaine and  xxxd305xxx  binding in the closed
channel, we used the kcsa channel structure24 as a structural
template.11. the four s6 ␣-helices at their c-ends at the level
of tyr1766 in divs6 form a so called “s6 crossing,”
producing an inner cavity below the selectivity filter with a
restricted space for only 40 to 50 molecules of water.24 if
lidocaine is placed in this volume, it displaces 20 to 25
molecules of water (ie, approximately half of the water). this
would organize the remaining water, making it “structured”
around lidocaine, likely producing an environment with a
lower dielectric constant in the range of 4 to 1025 than bulk
water (⬇80). as a consequence, the lower dielectric constant
would be expected to bias occupancy of the closed channel
with neutral forms of lidocaine and other local anesthetic

block the closed state well26
in this model, neutral lidocaine and  xxxd305xxx  would be
predicted to show comparable block in the closed state
because they interact similarly in the closed channel with

figure 5. proposed location for lidocaine (a and b) and  xxxd305xxx  (c and d) in the closed (a and c) and open/inactivated na
channel (b and d). lidocaine and  xxxd305xxx  are shown as
space-filled docking in the interface of iiis6-ivs6 (green ribbons). green color represents c atoms, blue represents n
atoms, and red represents o atoms. amino acid residues making contacts with drugs are shown by blue (iiis6) and red (ivs6)
colors. the optimized structures of the complexes with the inner
pore were calculated with the discover module of insight ii. it
should be noted that because of the differences in sizes
between residues in  xxxg2028xxx  when compared to those in kcsa,
construction of the homology model in na channel with its bulky
residues required additional optimization of the structure at the
s6 crossing to avoid nonbonded repulsion between side chains.
the tertiary amine of lidocaine and the primary amine of  xxxd305xxx  are predicted to be oriented similarly in the open/inactivated channel where the drugs adopt a vertical orientation. the
aromatic ring of  xxxd305xxx  fits into the interface between
diiis6 and divs6. e and f, lidocaine and  xxxd305xxx  are
shown aligned as they are oriented in the closed channel and in
the open/inactivated channel. in the closed channel both are
oriented more horizontally (e) with their aromatic rings aligned
with phe1759.

their aromatic rings located close to the aromatic ring of
phe1759 (figure 5a, 5c, and 5e). in this drug orientation
(across the inner cavity), the other flexible end of each
molecule would extend to just above the narrow part of the
cavity close to the s6 crossing. this model is consistent with
mutational data in which alanine or even charged residue
substitutions of multiple s6 residues in different domains
produce little or no change in tonic block,3,7,8,27 suggesting
that size rather than charge of the amino acid side chain is
important. such low affinity interactions would likely be

idea, the energies of interactions, recalculated with lidocaine
interacting with our closed channel model with mutations of
phe1759, did not appreciably change.

homology model of inner-pore na channel
interactions with drugs that produce
voltage-sensor inhibition
crystal structures for bacterial k channels in the open/inactivated conformation28 can also be used to model the inner
pore conformation that permits voltage-sensor inhibition,11
although the open/inactivated conformation of bacterial k
channels is expected to differ in its details from that of the
voltage-gated na channel. in the open conformation, the
carboxyl ends of the s6 ␣-helices in domains i-iv are
predicted to form a wide opening filled by bulk water (figure
5b and 5d), with 2 important consequences. first, it favors
protonation of the amino group of lidocaine, thereby permitting the positively-charged amine to participate in ␲– cation
interactions with phe1759. second, the open pore favors
hydrophobic interactions of the nonpolar part of lidocaine (its
alkyl chains and aromatic ring) with the nonpolar residues of
the s6 helices that form the sides of the channel, thereby
achieving dense packing of lidocaine against the interface of
diii and div (figure 5b). the highest affinity interaction
between drugs and the open/inactivated channels is correlated
with drugs that have a positively charged amine such as
lidocaine, the permanently charged analogs qx-222 and
qx-314, and  xxxd2113xxx  (with its pka of 9.3). all of these
drugs are expected to have high affinity via an interaction of
the charged amine with the aromatic ring of phe1759.4,11
how does neutral  xxxd305xxx  interact with phe1759 and
produce voltage-sensor inhibition? although  xxxd305xxx 
(figure 5f) has an overall neutral charge, it does have a
polarized structure. the aromatic part of  xxxd305xxx  is an
aniline, which has a dipole moment of 1.5 debye attributable
to the lone electron pair of nitrogen delocalizing into the
aromatic ring. the other side of the molecule has an aromatic
ring of the ester group further increasing the dipole moment
of  xxxd305xxx  to 3.9 debye.29  xxxd305xxx  is an arylamine,
and for this class of compounds, the partial positive charges
on the hydrogen atoms of the primary amino group are
approximately ⫹0.22 electronic charge, and the charge on n
is approximately ⫺0.42.30 this same charge distribution is
found in the amine of the side chains of asn and gln,25 which
have a propensity to interact with aromatic side chains
(amino–aromatic interactions) in proteins.31 therefore, it is
reasonable to suggest that  xxxd305xxx  could participate in
such an amino-aromatic interaction. if the primary amine of
 xxxd305xxx  behaves like the tertiary amine of lidocaine, then
the amine of  xxxd305xxx  would be expected to adopt a
position at right angles to the ring of phe1759, as shown in
figure 5d. the combination of an absence of charge, the
smaller size of  xxxd305xxx , and the fact that it cannot make an
aromatic-aromatic interaction with tyr1766 would then most
likely make it lower affinity.
it should be noted that in the restricted volume of the
closed channel, both lidocaine and  xxxd305xxx  adopt a somewhat horizontal position (figure 5e), where their aromatic
rings interact weakly with phe1759 (figure 5a, 5c, and 5e).

497

in contrast, in the open/inactivated channel both lidocaine and
 xxxd305xxx  reorient vertically (figure 5f) with their tertiary
and primary amines directed upward for stronger interaction
with ␲-clouds of phe1759 (figure 5b and 5d).

discussion
these experiments characterize 2 distinct components to
antiarrhythmic drug block of voltage-gated na channels,
which can be related to structural channel conformations and
can be used to interpret experimental data that may reflect
contributions from both types of block. the first type is
essentially voltage-independent. we term it lipophilic block
to emphasize our proposal that it represents neutral forms of
drugs interacting with neutral residues in the closed channel
pore. the closest analog in the literature would be first pulse
block, that block observed in the first depolarization after
exposure to drug while holding at a very negative potential.
the other is voltage-dependent, and we term it voltage-sensor
inhibition to emphasize that it results from stabilization of the
s4s in domains iii and iv. voltage-sensor inhibition depends
on interaction of drug with phe1759 (in divs6 just below the
selectivity filter), and it is responsible for high-affinity block
in the tens of micromolar range for lidocaine. lipophilic
block, on the other hand, has a lower affinity (in the
millimolar range) and involves the closed pore, but without a
specific interaction with phe1759 or the voltage sensors.
tonic block, as frequently reported in the literature, can have
contributions from both types, and it may have a great
variability depending on the na channel isoform, the specific
affinity of the drug and the effects of the membrane potential
on intrinsic channel kinetics.
modeling suggests that la interaction with the pore walls
is lipophilic, consistent with the finding that  xxxd305xxx  and
lidocaine have similar voltage-independent affinities for
closed channels. in contrast, their affinities differ markedly
between open/inactivated or closed/inactivated channels, a
reflection of difference in energy of interaction with the
␲– cation property of phe1759.9

link between phe1759 and high-affinity
voltage-sensor inhibition
phe1759 is a critical residue connecting antiarrhythmic drug
binding in the pore with the effects on gating charge causing
voltage-sensor inhibition. because la drugs modify the
gating charge movements of the s4s in both domains iii and
iv,13,14 it is unlikely that drug interaction solely with phe1759
in divs6 would be sufficient to affect the diiis4. in our
homology model of the open channel, la is predicted to sit
in a cleft between the side chains of leu1461 (diiis6) and
phe1759 (divs6) (figure 5). supporting evidence is also
available from mutagenesis studies in which mutations at
leu1461 also affect use-dependent block.32 close interaction
of lidocaine and  xxxd305xxx  with the interface between both
diiis6 and divs6 may constrain the movement of both s6s.
based on k channel structures,33 the constrained s6s may be
allosterically linked to their respective s4 voltage sensors by
interactions of the s4-s5 linkers with the intracellular tails of
the s6 helices. la interaction with phe1759 appears to be the
key to the complex structural changes that underlie the

relationship between pore residues, the voltage sensors, and
the activation gate.
the degree to which the open/fast inactivated na channel
resembles the open conformation of bacterial k channels that
we used in developing our open channel model is uncertain.
in addition, our model did not include structural changes
involved in fast inactivation. fast inactivation in voltagegated na channel results from binding of a portion of the
domain iii-iv linker (“the inactivation lid”)34,35 to the inner
pore. both lidocaine and qx drugs are low-affinity blockers
when fast inactivation is removed by intracellular proteolysis,36 when the ifm is mutated to qqq,37 or when ifm is
mutated to icm and modified by mtset,38 although highaffinity drug binding may only partially depend on inactivation lid binding.39 moreover, when the domain iii and domain
iv voltage sensors were artificially held in an outward,
depolarized position, very high-affinity lidocaine block occurred even in the absence of rapid depolarization rates,
although an intact fast inactivation process was required to
achieve highest affinity.38

voltage-dependent na channel availability and
antiarrhythmic drugs
the separation of la block into lipophilic and voltage-sensor
components allows for understanding the classical changes in
voltage-dependent na channel availability curves observed
for antiarrhythmic drugs. at any given holding membrane
potential, tonic block results from both lipophilic block and
voltage-sensor inhibition. under ideal conditions, tonic block
at very negative membrane potentials would correspond to
lipophilic block of closed/rested channels.15 this is probably
never achieved in practice after cells have been repeatedly
depolarized, but the block evident in the first depolarization
after exposure to drug from a very negative holding potential
may best approximate it.5 in contrast, as the membrane
potential becomes more positive (even at potentials where all
channels are fully available to open in the absence of drug;
see figure 2a) or as the concentration of drug is increased,
the probability of na channels becoming drug-bound in the
voltage sensor–inhibited conformation increases. furthermore, voltage-sensor inhibition by la occurs at voltages
negative to channel opening, suggesting that preopen, closed
states or closed-inactivated states, in addition to open/inactivated states, may increase interaction with phe1759.
in summary, the experiments reported here differentiate
between 2 types of block that lidocaine and lidocaine-like
drugs achieve in clinical use. one type, which we term
voltage-sensor inhibition, depends on drug interactions with
div-s6 phe1759 and its consequent effects on gating charge.
the other type occurs in the closed channel without specific
interaction with phe1759, and it appears to reflect distributed
interactions of the uncharged drug with the channel walls of
the closed pore with an affinity approximating 1 mmol/l. in
order for a drug to be a local anesthetic, either interaction
would be sufficient. however, voltage-sensor inhibition is the
more important drug– channel interaction for an antiarrhythmic drug. moreover, the la affinity for voltage-sensor
inhibition needs to be much greater than its affinity for
closed, hyperpolarized channels, so that block becomes more

prominent in depolarized than in normal polarized tissue. in
addition to producing voltage-sensor inhibition, kinetic rates
of drug– channel interaction must match kinetics of channel
transitions for use-dependence to occur.  xxxd305xxx  is not
useful as an antiarrhythmic not because it lacks the ability to
produce voltage-sensor inhibition, but because its affinity for
that conformation is too low. its involvement with the voltage
sensors is indirectly evident in ionic current measurements,
but it can be directly observed in gating current recordings. at
2 mmol/l, it produced only about half of the maximum effect
on gating charge compared to lidocaine, which was estimated
to have an ed50 of ⬇15 ␮mol/l lidocaine, on the other hand,
with its ⬎50-fold differential between lipophilic block and
voltage-sensor inhibition, is a commonly used antiarrhythmic
drug.
