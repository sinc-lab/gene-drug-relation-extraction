pharmacological
properties

therapeutic efficacy in
hypertension

irbesartan ( xxxd2382xxx ®, avapro®,  xxxd2382xxx ®,  xxxd2382xxx ®), an  xxxg99xxx  receptor
type 1 antagonist, is approved in many countries worldwide for the treatment of
hypertension. it is also approved in some regions for the treatment of nephropathy
in patients with hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus. in adults with essential
hypertension, irbesartan is effective at reducing blood pressure (bp) over a
24-hour period with once-daily administration. irbesartan also slows the progression of renal disease in hypertensive patients with type 2 diabetes, with this effect
partly independent of its bp-lowering effect. in addition, irbesartan was generally
well tolerated in clinical trials. thus, irbesartan is a useful treatment option for
patients with hypertension, including those with type 2 diabetes and nephropathy.
irbesartan is an  xxxg99xxx  receptor type 1 antagonist. it has an inhibitory effect
on the pressor response to  xxxg99xxx  and reduces bp in hypertensive patients.
it reduces left ventricular mass, arterial stiffness and vascular endothelial dysfunction and inflammation. irbesartan exerts renoprotective effects that are, in part,
independent of reductions in bp. irbesartan improves endothelial function, oxidative stress and inflammation in the kidney. it induces renal vasodilation and
decreases the filtration fraction without reducing the glomerular filtration rate. in
an animal model, irbesartan prevented the downregulation of nephrin.
irbesartan induced regression of left ventricular mass in patients with hypertension and left ventricular hypertrophy in several trials. reductions in left
ventricular mass index were significantly greater with irbesartan than with
amlodipine or atenolol, despite the drugs achieving similar reductions in bp.
oral irbesartan is absorbed rapidly, reaching peak plasma concentrations
(cmax) after 1.5–2 hours. cmax and area under the plasma concentration-time
curve increase in a dose-dependent manner. irbesartan is metabolized by cytochrome p450 isozyme 2c9, with the metabolites having minimal pharmacological
activity. elimination is by both biliary and renal routes. the terminal elimination
half-life of irbesartan is 11–16 hours.
the bp-lowering efficacy of irbesartan monotherapy in adults with essential
hypertension was demonstrated in a number of well designed placebo- or activecontrolled trials. at a dosage of 150 mg once daily, irbesartan led to placebosubtracted reductions in trough seated bp of ≈8/5 mmhg. reductions in bp were
maintained over a 24-hour period with once-daily administration. reductions in
bp with irbesartan were dose-related but plateaued above a dosage of 300 mg
once daily. in active-controlled trials, irbesartan reduced trough seated bp by
10–23/7–13 mmhg compared with reductions of 8–25/5–14 mmhg with comparator agents. response rates were 34–72% with irbesartan compared with 38–68%
for comparator drugs.

irbesartan: a review

1545

irbesartan 150–300 mg once daily reduced trough seated diastolic bp (dbp)
significantly more than losartan 50–100 mg once daily in two trials (by 3 and
2 mmhg), but the reduction in systolic bp (sbp) was significantly greater for
irbesartan (by 5 mmhg) in only one of these studies, and there were no significant
differences in response rates between the drugs. in a study in japan, irbesartan
200 mg once daily was shown to be noninferior to losartan 100 mg once daily.
irbesartan 150 mg once daily led to significantly greater reductions in trough
seated dbp and sbp (by 6/3 mmhg) and a higher response rate than  xxxd3487xxx 
80 mg once daily in the only study comparing these agents to include a statistical
comparison. irbesartan 150 mg once daily reduced trough seated dbp significantly less than olmesartan 20 mg once daily in a single trial, but produced similar
reductions in trough seated sbp and 24-hour ambulatory bp to olmesartan.
several trials have shown irbesartan 150–300 mg once daily to be as effective
as enalapril 10–20 mg once daily, including in patients aged ≥65 years. in
japanese patients, irbesartan 50–100 mg once daily was shown to be noninferior
to enalapril 5–10 mg once daily. single trials showed that irbesartan 75–150 mg
once daily produced similar reductions in bp to atenolol 50–100 mg once daily
and that irbesartan 150 mg once daily was as effective as amlodipine 5 mg once
daily.
noncomparative extension studies and large observational studies provided
additional evidence of the efficacy of irbesartan in hypertension.
therapeutic efficacy in
diabetic nephropathy

the efficacy of irbesartan at slowing the progression of renal damage in hypertensive patients with type 2 diabetes was demonstrated in two large, well designed
trials of ≥2 years’ duration. in both studies, additional antihypertensive drugs
(with the exception of angiotensin receptor antagonists, ace inhibitors or
dihydropyridine calcium channel antagonists) were used if necessary to achieve
target bp.
in the irma 2 trial, in patients with microalbuminuria (20–200 mug/min
[≈30–300 mg/day]) but normal creatinine levels, overt nephropathy developed in
significantly fewer recipients of irbesartan 300 mg (but not 150 mg) once daily
compared with placebo. however, even at a dosage of 150 mg/day, irbesartan
significantly reduced urinary protein (albumin excretion rate) compared with
placebo. the effect of irbesartan on microalbuminuria was at least partly independent of its bp-lowering effect. in a subgroup of patients who had all antihypertensive medication withdrawn for 1 month at the end of the main study, a significant
reduction in albumin excretion rate compared with baseline persisted in the
irbesartan 300 mg once daily group.
in the idnt, in patients with hypertension, type 2 diabetes, proteinuria (≥900
mg/day) and a raised serum creatinine level, irbesartan 300 mg once daily
significantly delayed the progression of renal damage compared with amlodipine
10 mg once daily or placebo; again, this effect was at least partly independent of
the effect on bp. the relative risk of reaching the primary endpoint (a composite
of doubling of baseline serum creatinine level, onset of end-stage renal disease or
death from any cause) was significantly lower in the irbesartan group compared
with the amlodipine and placebo groups. the difference remained significant
when adjusted for mean arterial pressure.

several other trials, including a small crossover study, large open-label observational studies, and a controlled trial that included nondiabetic as well as diabetic
patients, provided additional evidence of the beneficial effect of irbesartan on
albuminuria.
tolerability

irbesartan was generally well tolerated by patients with mild to moderate hypertension. there was no significant difference between irbesartan (≤900 mg/day)
and placebo in the overall incidence of adverse events considered possibly or
probably related to treatment during placebo-controlled trials. adverse events
reported in ≥1% of irbesartan recipients and with a numerically higher incidence
than with placebo included diarrhoea, dyspepsia/heartburn and fatigue. the
overall incidence of adverse events was generally similar for irbesartan and
comparator agents, including other  xxxg99xxx  receptor antagonists and drugs
from other classes. irbesartan was associated with a lower incidence of cough than
enalapril in several trials.
the adverse event profile for irbesartan in hypertensive patients with type 2
diabetes and nephropathy was generally similar to that in patients with hypertension. however, in patients with proteinuria and elevated serum creatinine levels,
orthostatic symptoms and hyperkalaemia occurred numerically more frequently
with irbesartan than with placebo.

pharmacoeconomic
considerations

the cost consequences of irbesartan treatment in patients with hypertension, type
2 diabetes and nephropathy were predicted using markov modelling based on
outcomes from idnt. treatment with irbesartan improved life expectancy and
was cost saving compared with amlodipine or control therapy over 10- and/or 25year time horizons for belgium, france, italy, spain, the uk, the us and canada.
control therapy was standard antihypertensive treatment excluding ace inhibitors, other  xxxg99xxx  receptor antagonists or dihydropyridine calcium antagonists, and corresponded to the placebo group in idnt.
modelled analyses also predicted that early initiation of irbesartan (when
microalbuminuria was detected) would improve life expectancy and reduce costs
compared with later initiation (when advanced overt nephropathy was present) in
france, the us and asia. both early and late initiation of irbesartan increased life
expectancy and led to cost savings compared with control therapy. screening for
albuminuria followed by irbesartan treatment for positive tests improved outcomes and was cost saving in a model for france.

1. introduction
hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus are
common conditions, affecting more than 970 million and 170 million people worldwide.[1,2] both are
risk factors for the occurrence of cardiovascular
events.[3,4] in addition, both hypertension and diabetic nephropathy are major causes of end-stage renal
disease (esrd), the prevalence of which is increas© 2008 adis data information bv. all rights reserved.

ing.[3,5] a number of different classes of antihypertensive drugs are available, including those that
affect the renin-angiotensin system (ras), such as
 xxxg99xxx  receptor antagonists and ace inhibitors.[6] drugs that inhibit the ras may also have a
specific renoprotective effect, making them a rational choice of antihypertensive therapy in patients
with type 2 diabetes and nephropathy.[6]

irbesartan: a review

irbesartan ( xxxd2382xxx ®, avapro®,  xxxd2382xxx ®,
 xxxd2382xxx ®)1 is a nonpeptide  xxxg99xxx  receptor
type 1 antagonist with a well established clinical
profile.[7] this article reviews the pharmacology,
therapeutic efficacy and tolerability of oral irbesartan when used as monotherapy in the treatment of
essential hypertension, and when used as monotherapy or combination therapy in the treatment of nephropathy in hypertensive patients with type 2 diabetes.
2. pharmacodynamic properties
the phamacodynamic properties of irbesartan
have been reviewed previously.[7] a brief overview
is provided here, together with additional discussion
of the renoprotective effects of irbesartan.
irbesartan is an  xxxg99xxx  receptor type 1
antagonist. it exerts an inhibitory effect on the pressor response to  xxxg99xxx  and reduces blood
pressure (bp) in hypertensive patients (table i). in
addition, irbesartan may induce structural vascular
changes beyond those attributable to changes in bp;
it reduces left ventricular mass (section 2.1), improves arterial elasticity, and reduces vascular endothelial dysfunction and inflammation (table i).
irbesartan exhibits renoprotective effects (table i;
see section 5 for a more detailed description of the
renal effects of irbesartan in patients with hypertension and type 2 diabetes in large clinical trials).
while some of the protective effect may be attributable to reductions in bp, it is apparent that the
renoprotection associated with irbesartan is at least
partly independent of its effects on bp. for example,
in hypertensive patients with type 2 diabetes and
nephropathy, treatment with irbesartan reduced the
risk of reaching an adverse renal endpoint by an
additional 33% beyond the reduction achieved
through lowering systolic bp (sbp).[8]
irbesartan reduces proteinuria in hypertensive
patients with type 2 diabetes and albuminuria (table
i and section 5). proteinuria is a marker of renal
damage, but it is also nephrotoxic and may contribute to the progression of renal damage,[9] so the
1

1547

reduction of proteinuria seen with irbesartan is important. however, for a specific level of proteinuria
reduction, irbesartan has been shown to provide
greater protection against renal failure than a calcium channel antagonist, despite both drugs achieving
similar reductions in bp (section 5.2), suggesting
that mechanisms other than bp and proteinuria reduction may also play a role.[10]
elevated glomerular pressure, hyperfiltration, endothelial dysfunction and oxidative stress have been
implicated in the development of renal damage.[9,11]
irbesartan has been shown to improve endothelial
function, oxidative stress and inflammation in the
kidney and elsewhere (table i).[12-18] it also causes
renal vasodilation and decreases the filtration fraction without reducing the glomerular filtration
rate.[19-21] in addition, in an animal model, irbesartan
prevented the downregulation of nephrin, a protein
found in the slit diaphragm of the glomerular podocyte barrier and so involved in the functioning of the
filtration barrier.[22] these intrarenal effects may
contribute towards the renoprotective effect of irbesartan.
2.1 effects on left ventricular hypertrophy

left ventricular hypertrophy is a risk factor for
cardiovascular events and mortality.[48] irbesartan
reduced left ventricular mass in patients with mild to
moderate hypertension and left ventricular hypertrophy in randomized, double-blind (n = 115)[49] or
open-label/blinded-endpoint (n = 60)[50] comparative trials.
irbesartan 150–300 mg once daily for 6 months
led to a significantly (p < 0.0001) greater reduction
in left ventricular mass index (lvmi) than seen with
amlodipine 5–10 mg once daily, despite bp being
reduced to a similar extent by both drugs.[50] adjusted mean reductions from baseline in lvmi were
35 g/m2 (25%; from a baseline of 141 g/m2) for
irbesartan compared with 18 g/m2 (13%; from a
baseline of 138 g/m2) for amlodipine.[50]
irbesartan 150–300 mg once daily was associated
with a significantly greater reduction in lvmi than

long-lasting, dose-related inhibition of the pressor response to exogenous ang ii in healthy volunteers, with peak inhibition after
2–4 hours and effect lasting >24 hours[24,26-28]
inhibitory effect on the pressor response to exogenous ang ii was generally greater and lasted longer with irb than with losartan or
 xxxd3487xxx  in healthy volunteers; receptor occupancy and ↑ in ang ii levels were also greater with irb[26,27]
changes in ang ii levels were similar with irb and candesartan in healthy volunteers, but the effect occurred more rapidly with irb; in
addition, plasma renin activity and receptor occupancy were greater with irb[29,30]
cardiovascular and haemodynamic effects
no significant effect on bp or heart rate in salt-replete normotensive volunteers,[24] whereas in salt-depleted normotensive volunteers
(i.e. with activation of the ras) bp ↓ in a dose-dependent manner (with no effect on heart rate).[31] irb plus fosinopril ↓ bp in
normotensive volunteers with a high salt intake (low-renin state), whereas neither agent alone ↓ bp[32]
↓ bp in patients with hypertension (section 4)

atenolol 50–100 mg once daily after 48 weeks in
another study.[49] add-on therapy with hydrochlorothiazide (from week 12) and  xxxd2092xxx  (from week
24) was permitted to control bp, and was required
by 60% of irbesartan and 51% of atenolol recipients.
overall, bp was reduced to a similar extent in both
groups. after 12 weeks of monotherapy, mean
lvmi had decreased by 9 g/m2 (from a baseline of
154 g/m2) in the irbesartan group and by 1 g/m2
(from a baseline of 144 g/m2) with atenolol (statistical comparison not performed). at study end, the
mean reduction in lvmi was significantly greater
for the irbesartan group than for the atenolol group
(26 vs 14 g/m2; p = 0.024).[49] an additional analysis
of this study also found that irbesartan reduced qt
interval and corrected qt (qtc) interval dispersion
to a greater extent than atenolol after 48 weeks.[51]
among patients who remained on monotherapy for
the entire study, changes in qt and qtc interval
dispersion with irbesartan (n = 17) were –16.7 ms
and –17.5 ms, and with atenolol (n = 24) were
+10 ms and +6.5 ms (p < 0.01 for between-group
comparisons).[51] irbesartan and atenolol improved
diastolic function to a similar extent during the
study; the improvement was partly related to
changes in left ventricular geometry with irbesartan,
but solely with reduction in bp for atenolol.[52]
3. pharmacokinetic properties
the pharmacokinetics of single and/or multiple
doses of oral irbesartan have been evaluated in
healthy adults[23,53-55] and patients with renal impairment,[25] hepatic impairment[56] or heart failure.[57]
key pharmacokinetic parameters are summarized in table ii. oral irbesartan is absorbed rapidly,

with little accumulation after multiple doses (table
ii). peak plasma concentration (cmax) and area
under the plasma concentration-time curve (auc)
values increased in a linear, dose-dependent manner after single or multiple doses of irbesartan
150–600 mg in healthy volunteers.[23] the mean
absolute bioavailability of irbesartan was
≈60–80%[53] and was unaffected by food.[58] steadystate concentrations were reached within 3 days with
once-daily administration.[23]
irbesartan is ≥90% plasma protein bound[59,60]
and has a mean steady-state volume of distribution
of 53–93 l in healthy volunteers.[53]
irbesartan is metabolized through glucuronidation and oxidation.[54,61,62] the major route of oxidation is via cytochrome p450 (cyp) isozyme 2c9,
and metabolism by cyp3a4 is negligible.[62] after
oral administration of [14c]-irbesartan, 76–81% of
the plasma radioactivity was attributed to unchanged irbesartan.[54] none of the eight metabolites
identified exceeded 9% of the plasma radioactivity
and the metabolites showed minimal pharmacological activity.[54] irbesartan and its metabolites are
eliminated through both biliary and renal routes.[53]
approximately 17% of a radiolabelled oral dose was
recovered in the urine, and the remainder in faeces;
unmetabolized drug accounted for <10% of radioactivity in urine and ≈30% of radioactivity recovered
in faeces.[54]
in healthy volunteers, mean total plasma clearance was ≈9–11 l/h, renal clearance was 0.18 l/
h,[53] and the elimination half-life was
11–16 hours.[23]

3.1 special populations

there was no significant difference between the
sexes in the pharmacokinetics of irbesartan.[55] auc
and cmax were 43% and 49% higher in the elderly
than in younger volunteers (p < 0.05); however, the
terminal elimination half-life did not differ significantly[55] and dosage modifications are not generally
required in elderly patients (see section 8).
the pharmacokinetics of irbesartan were not altered significantly in patients with mild to severe
renal impairment (including haemodialysis patients), mild to moderate hepatic impairment[56] or
heart failure.[57]
3.2 drug interactions

irbesartan is metabolized principally by cyp2c9
and so the potential for interactions with other substrates, or with inhibitors, of this isozyme has been
investigated.[63] in healthy volunteers, fluconazole, a
potent cyp2c9 inhibitor, increased steady-state
cmax and auc of irbesartan by 19% and 63%, but
did not alter the time to cmax.[64] effects on bp were
not assessed in the study. there was no significant
interaction between irbesartan and nifedipine,[65]
warfarin,[66] simvastatin[67] or  xxxd3394xxx .[68]
in other interaction studies, hydrochlorothiazide[69] and a magnesium/ xxxd131xxx  antacid[70] did not alter the pharmacokinetics of irbesartan, and irbesartan did not affect the pharmacokinetics of digoxin.[71]
4. therapeutic efficacy in hypertension
the bp-lowering efficacy of oral irbesartan
monotherapy in patients with mild to moderate hypertension has been evaluated in a number of randomized, double-blind, placebo-[72-75] or active[45,76-88] controlled, multicentre trials of up to
12 months’ duration. noncomparative extension
studies assessed efficacy over a longer period of
1–2 years.[89] additional efficacy data come from
large open-label observational studies,[90-93] the largest of which enrolled more than 31 000 patients.[91]
all except a few studies[77,82,84] specified that

trials enrolled patients with a seated diastolic bp
(dbp) of 95–110 mmhg;[72-74,76-81,84,85,88] other studies used 95–115[82,90] or 110–115[83] mmhg. in one
japanese trial, patients were eligible if they had
either sbp ≥160 or dbp ≥95 mmhg (and if they had
both sbp ≥150 and dbp ≥90 mmhg),[86] and in
another japanese trial, patients were eligible if they
had both sbp ≥150 and dbp ≥95 mmhg (or if they
had both sbp ≥160 and dbp ≥90 mmhg).[87] other
trials enrolled patients with diabetes and elevated
dbp (90–105 mmhg[45] or not specified[91]) or with
the metabolic syndrome and elevated bp (>130/85
mmhg[93] or not specified[92]). exclusion criteria
generally included secondary hypertension, significant cardiovascular disease and renal impairment.
some studies allowed add-on therapy in patients
with an inadequate response to monotherapy, but
outcomes were assessed with irbesartan monotherapy.[82,84,91,92]
in the majority of randomized studies, the primary efficacy parameter was the reduction in trough
seated dbp[45,75-77,79,81-85,87,88] (unless otherwise
specified, changes in bp described in the following
subsections refer to mean changes in trough seated
bp). response was most often defined as dbp
<90 mmhg (termed normalization) or a reduction in
dbp of ≥10 mmhg from baseline. in a few studies,
24-hour ambulatory bp was the primary endpoint.[72,78,80] in one of the japanese trials, the primary efficacy outcome was the antihypertensive rate,
which was defined as the percentage of patients who
met the protocol-specified criteria for a decrease in
bp.[86]
4.1 placebo-controlled trials

in placebo-controlled trials in patients with mild
to moderate hypertension, irbesartan 75–300 mg
once daily for 6–12 weeks reduced dbp and sbp
to a significantly greater extent than placebo
(p < 0.01).[72-75] reductions in bp were dose-related
and plateaued above a dosage of 300 mg once
daily.[75] at a dosage of 150 mg once daily,
irbesartan led to placebo-subtracted reductions in
trough seated bp of ≈8/5 mmhg.[75] effects on bp

 xxxd3487xxx ,[80] but was less effective at reducing dbp
than olmesartan[83] (table iii). response rates were
50–64% for irbesartan 150–300 mg once daily compared with 43–56% for other  xxxg99xxx  receptor
antagonists.
once-daily irbesartan 300 mg (but not irbesartan
150 mg) led to significantly greater reductions in
both sbp and dbp than losartan 100 mg once daily
(by 5 and 3 mmhg) in a fixed-dose trial,[81] while
irbesartan 150–300 mg once daily reduced dbp (but
not sbp) to a significantly greater extent (2 mmhg)
than losartan 50–100 mg once daily in a trial in
which doses were titrated according to response
(table iii).[82]
drugs 2008; 68 (11)

1552

a noninferiority study in 392 japanese patients
with essential hypertension found that irbesartan
200 mg once daily was no less effective than
losartan 100 mg once daily (table iii).[87] after a
4-week observation period, patients were randomized to receive irbesartan 100 mg once daily or
losartan 50 mg once daily for 2 weeks, followed by
an increase in dosage to irbesartan 200 mg once
daily (n = 195) or losartan 100 mg once daily
(n = 197) for 6 weeks. the mean reduction in trough
dbp (primary endpoint) was 9.37 mmhg in the
irbesartan group and 9.22 mmhg in the losartan
group. the mean between-group difference (after
adjustment via analysis of covariance) for the
change in dbp was 0.21 mmhg (95% ci –1.40,
1.81). the lower limit of the 95% ci (–1.40 mmhg)
was higher than the prespecified limit for noninferiority (–2.2 mmhg), indicating that irbesartan was
not inferior to losartan. these results were similar
regardless of age, bp at the end of the observation
period or plasma renin activity during the observation period.
compared with  xxxd3487xxx  80 mg once daily,
irbesartan 150 mg once daily achieved significantly
larger reductions in both dbp and sbp when assessed by seated bp (table iii) and ambulatory bp
(based on the only trial that included a statistical
comparison of these two agents).[80] mean reduction
in ambulatory dbp at trough (the primary efficacy
variable in this study) was 7 mmhg with irbesartan
versus 5 mmhg for  xxxd3487xxx  (p = 0.035). in a single
trial, olmesartan 20 mg once daily was associated
with a significantly greater reduction in seated dbp
(but not sbp) compared with irbesartan 150 mg
once daily (table iii). however, in a substudy[83] and
an additional analysis of data from the trial,[94] there
was no significant difference for change in mean
24-hour ambulatory bp, which was assessed as a
secondary variable (13/9 mmhg for olmesartan vs
11/7 mmhg for irbesartan),[83] nor for achievement
of a goal rate of <130/80 mmhg for mean ambulatory bp (21% vs 14%).[94]
in terms of response rates, there were no significant differences between irbesartan and other  xxxg99xxx  receptor antagonists except for the com© 2008 adis data information bv. all rights reserved.

significantly higher response rate (table iii).
4.2.2 comparisons with other
antihypertensive classes

in randomized comparisons against drugs from
other antihypertensive classes, once-daily irbesartan
was as effective at reducing bp as enalapril,[76-79,86]
atenolol[84] and amlodipine,[85] and was more effective at reducing bp than doxazosin[45] in patients
with mild to moderate hypertension (table iv).
irbesartan and the renin inhibitor  xxxd113xxx  had similar bp-lowering efficacy when both drugs were administered at their recommended starting dosage of
150 mg once daily.[88] response rates were 34–72%
with irbesartan and 38–68% with comparator agents
(table iv).
in several trials,[76,78,79] irbesartan 150–300 mg
once daily for 8–12 weeks led to similar reductions
in bp and response rates to those seen with enalapril
10–20 mg once daily, including in patients aged
≥65 years.[76] another 12-week study found the efficacy of irbesartan 75–300 mg once daily to be
similar to that of enalapril 10–40 mg once daily.[77]
in all of these studies, doses were titrated according
to response.
in addition, a noninferiority study in japanese
patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension found irbesartan 50–100 mg once daily was no
less effective than enalapril 5–10 mg once daily
(table iv).[86] the 12-week optional titration study
included a total of 259 patients in the primary efficacy analysis, which showed that 73.5% of patients
in the irbesartan group and 74.0% of those in the
enalapril group met the prespecified criteria for decreased bp. with the margin of equivalence set at
10%, results showed that the antihypertensive effect
among patients in the irbesartan group was not inferior to that observed among patients treated with
enalapril. the bp normalization (or response) rates
in the respective treatment groups were 51.5% and
56.7%; the difference was not statistically significant.
reductions in mean 24-hour ambulatory bp were
also similar for irbesartan and enalapril.[78,79] in one
trial in which it was the primary efficacy parameter,

24-hour ambulatory bp was reduced by a mean 15/
9 mmhg with irbesartan 150–300 mg once daily and
13/9 mmhg with enalapril 10–20 mg once daily,
with a response rate of 71% in both groups.[78]
single trials compared irbesartan with other
drugs. reductions in bp were similar for irbesartan
75–150 mg once daily and atenolol 50–100 mg once
daily after 12 weeks of treatment,[84] and for irbesartan 150 mg once daily and amlodipine 5 mg once
daily in a 4-week study in patients of non-africanamerican origin.[85] irbesartan and  xxxd113xxx  reduced
bp to a similar extent after 8 weeks, when both
drugs were given at their recommended starting
dosage of 150 mg once daily, although mean reduction in dbp was significantly greater with  xxxd113xxx 
300 mg once daily than with irbesartan 150 mg once
daily.[88] in patients with type 2 diabetes and mild
hypertension, the decrease from baseline in sbp and
dbp after 1 year of treatment was significantly
greater (by 4/1 mmhg) with irbesartan 300 mg once
daily than with doxazosin 4 mg once daily (table

randomized to receive once-daily irbesartan 150 mg
(n = 963; bp at randomization 173/106 mmhg) or
irbesartan 300 mg (n = 1000; bp 174/106 mmhg)
for the next 5 weeks. at the end of this period, the
normalization rate (primary endpoint) was higher
with irbesartan 300 mg once daily than with 150 mg
once daily (63% vs 53%; p < 0.001). mean reductions in both trough sbp and dbp were significantly greater with irbesartan 300 mg once daily than
with irbesartan 150 mg once daily (9/6 vs 6/
5 mmhg; p < 0.001 for sbp and dbp).[90]
several
large
observational
studies
(n = 3259–31 793) found that 3–9 months’ treatment
with irbesartan at dosages up to 300 mg/day reduced
bp from baseline by up to 26/13 mmhg in patients
with type 2 diabetes[91] or with the metabolic syndrome[92,93] (p < 0.0001 where stated[91,92]). however, a substantial proportion of patients received
other antihypertensive medications throughout these
studies (more than half where stated[91]) so they do
not specifically evaluate irbesartan monotherapy;
nonetheless, they provide useful data on these patient groups in a routine clinical practice setting.

4.3 open-label and noncomparative trials

a pooled analysis of five noncomparative extension studies evaluated long-term efficacy over
≥12 months.[89] irbesartan was titrated from 75 mg
or 150 mg once daily to 300 mg once daily according to response, and if a bp of <140/90 mmhg was
still not achieved, other antihypertensive agents
could be added. of those patients who achieved
target bp after 12 months (520 of 821 patients), 66%
were receiving irbesartan monotherapy. of the 684
patients whose bp was normalized (trough seated
dbp <90 mmhg), 64% were receiving irbesartan
monotherapy.[89]
a large open-label observational study in
14 820 patients with mild to moderate hypertension
evaluated the efficacy of irbesartan 300 mg once
daily in patients who were non-normalized responders to 150 mg once daily.[90] patients initially received irbesartan 150 mg once daily for 6 weeks,
after which 62% had a normalized bp. non-normalized responders (decrease from baseline in dbp of
≥10 mmhg but dbp still ≥90 mmhg) were then

5. therapeutic efficacy in hypertensive
patients with diabetic nephropathy
the efficacy of irbesartan in the management of
diabetic nephropathy in patients with hypertension
has been evaluated in two large (n >500), randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multinational trials, irma 2 (irbesartan microalbuminuria
type 2 diabetes in hypertensive patients)[12] and
idnt (irbesartan diabetic nephropathy trial).[95]
these trials are known collectively as prime (program for irbesartan mortality and morbidity evaluation).[96] irma 2 evaluated the efficacy of
irbesartan in patients with type 2 diabetes and hypertension who had early-stage renal damage, as indicated by microalbuminuria.[12] patients were enrolled if they had sbp >135 mmhg, dbp
>85 mmhg or both. idnt evaluated the efficacy of
irbesartan in patients with type 2 diabetes and hypertension with established nephropathy, as indicated by proteinuria and elevated serum creatinine
levels.[95] patients were enrolled if they had sbp
drugs 2008; 68 (11)

irbesartan: a review

5.1 patients with microalbuminuria

in irma 2, irbesartan delayed the progression to
nephropathy in hypertensive patients with type 2
diabetes and microalbuminuria, with the effect being partly independent of the reduction in bp it
caused.[12]
the trial enrolled 590 hypertensive patients with
type 2 diabetes, microalbuminuria (20–200 mug/min
[≈30–300 mg/day] for two out of three consecutive
samples) and normal creatinine levels.[12] patients
were randomized to receive irbesartan 150 mg once
daily (n = 195), irbesartan 300 mg once daily
(n = 194) or placebo (n = 201). mean baseline
glycated haemoglobin was 7.2%. additional antihypertensive drugs were needed by 45%, 43% and
56% of the irbesartan 150 mg once daily, irbesartan
300 mg once daily and placebo groups. follow-up
was for 2 years and the primary efficacy parameter
was the time to first detection of overt nephropathy
(defined as albumin excretion rate [aer] >200 mug/
min [≈300 mg/day] and at least 30% higher than at
baseline on at least two consecutive occasions).
© 2008 adis data information bv. all rights reserved.

the primary endpoint of overt nephropathy was
reached by significantly fewer patients in the
irbesartan 300 mg once daily group (but not the
irbesartan 150 mg once daily group) compared with
placebo (figure 1).[12] the unadjusted hazard ratio
(hr) for diabetic nephropathy was 0.30 (95% ci
0.14, 0.61; p < 0.001) for the irbesartan 300 mg once
daily group and 0.61 (95% ci 0.34, 1.08; p = 0.08)
for irbesartan 150 mg once daily. when adjusted for
baseline microalbuminuria level and bp during the
trial, the hr was 0.32 (95% ci 0.15, 0.65;
p < 0.001) for irbesartan 300 mg once daily and 0.56
(95% ci 0.31, 0.99; p = 0.05) for irbesartan 150 mg

300 mg once daily and placebo diverged from
3 months onwards.[12]
aer was reduced to a significantly greater extent
in the irbesartan 300 mg once daily and irbesartan
150 mg once daily groups than in the placebo group
(38% and 24% vs 2%; p < 0.001 for comparison
between the combined irbesartan groups and placebo); however, the reduction was also significantly
greater with irbesartan 300 mg once daily than with
irbesartan 150 mg once daily (p < 0.001).[12] normopatients developing nephropathy (%)

>135 mmhg, dbp >85 mmhg or documented treatment with antihypertensive agents. in irma 2, target bp was <135/85 mmhg.[12] in idnt, target was
defined as dbp of ≤85 mmhg and sbp of
≤135 mmhg (unless baseline sbp was >145 mmhg,
then the target was a decrease of ≥10 mmhg).[95] in
both studies, other angiotensin receptor antagonists,
ace inhibitors and dihydropyridine calcium channel antagonists were not permitted.[12,95] in irma 2,
patients continued on their usual antidiabetic medication.[12] the main analysis was performed on the
intention-to-treat population in both trials.[12,95]
additional data on the effects of irbesartan on
albuminuria are available from a small, placebocontrolled, crossover trial involving both hypertensive and normotensive diabetic patients with microalbuminuria,[97] a large double-blind, placebo-controlled study that evaluated hypertensive patients at
high cardiovascular risk (87% with type 2 diabetes)
who had either microalbuminuria or overt proteinuria,[98] and large, noncomparative observational
studies.[91,99-101]

albuminuria (aer <20 mug/min [≈30 mg/day]) was
restored in significantly more patients in the
irbesartan 300 mg once daily group (but not the
irbesartan 150 mg once daily group) than in the
placebo group (34% vs 24% vs 21%; p = 0.006 for
the comparison of irbesartan 300 mg once daily with
placebo). there was no significant difference between the three groups for the decline in creatinine
clearance during the study; in all groups, the decline
during the first 3 months was greater than the decline during the remainder of the study.
mean trough seated bp throughout the study was
141/83, 143/83 and 144/83 mmhg in the irbesartan
300 mg once daily, irbesartan 150 mg once daily and
placebo groups, respectively (p = 0.004 for the comparison of sbp between the combined irbesartan
groups and placebo).[12] there were no significant
between-group differences in 24-hour ambulatory
bp at study end in a subgroup of 43 patients in
whom it was measured; reductions were 7/8, 5/7 and
11/10 mmhg for the irbesartan 300 mg once daily,
irbesartan 150 mg once daily and placebo groups,
respectively.[102] nonetheless, mean reduction in
aer was significantly greater in the patients who
received irbesartan 300 or 150 mg once daily than in
those who received placebo in this subgroup (73%
for irbesartan 300 mg once daily and 38% for
irbesartan 150 mg once daily vs 0% for placebo;
p < 0.01 for overall comparison).[102]
glycated haemoglobin increased to a similar extent in the combined irbesartan groups and the placebo group during the study (0.4% vs 0.3%).[12]
in a substudy involving 133 patients, all antihypertensive medication was withdrawn for
1 month after the end of the original 2-year study
period.[103] during the withdrawal period, aer increased by 26%, 68% and 13% in the irbesartan
300 mg once daily, irbesartan 150 mg once daily and
placebo groups. comparing values at the end of the
withdrawal period with baseline values from the
start of irma 2, aer remained reduced by 47% in
the irbesartan 300 mg once daily group (p < 0.05),
but had increased by 11% in the irbesartan 150 mg
once daily group and by 14% in the placebo group
(both nonsignificant). the difference between the

two irbesartan dosage groups occurred despite increases in bp and glomerular filtration rate
during the 1-month period being similar for both
groups.[103]
in the small crossover study,[97] in which diabetic
patients with microalbuminuria received irbesartan
150 mg twice daily or placebo for 60 days, aer
decreased significantly from baseline in both the
hypertensive (n = 64) and normotensive (n = 60)
groups; placebo-subtracted reductions in aer were
31–32 mug/min (44.6–46.1 mg/day) in the hypertensive group and 29–35 mug/min (41.8–50.4 mg/day) in
the normotensive group (p < 0.01 for both groups).
however, mean 24-hour bp decreased significantly
(p < 0.01) only in the hypertensive patients and not
in the normotensive patients (placebo-subtracted reductions of 10–14/5–6 mmhg vs 3 to –2/0–1
mmhg). glycaemic control did not change significantly in either group.
in a large observational study in primary care, in
which 38 016 hypertensive patients with type 2 diabetes were treated for 6 months with irbesartan
75–300 mg once daily plus other antihypertensive
medications if necessary, 49% of patients had a
positive dipstick test for microalbuminuria at baseline.[99] after 6 months, this proportion had decreased to 23%, giving a statistically significant
relative reduction of 53% (p < 0.05). among patients who had been receiving an ace inhibitor
prior to the study (n = 16 672; 44% of the study
population), the proportion who had microalbuminuria decreased by 50% (p < 0.05) after switching to
irbesartan-based therapy for 6 months, i.e. decreased
to a similar extent to that seen for the overall population. at the 6-month timepoint, 5% of patients were
receiving an ace inhibitor in addition to
irbesartan.[99] other large observational studies
(n = 1657–11 605) also support the beneficial effects of irbesartan on microalbuminuria in a routine
clinical setting; however, not all separated the results for patients with microalbuminuria from those
with macroalbuminuria and in some studies not all
patients had diabetes.[91,100,101]

events) study was not specifically in diabetic patients with microalbuminuria, but a large proportion
of patients met these criteria, so it will be discussed
here.[98] the trial evaluated 405 hypertensive patients at high cardiovascular risk, with either microor macroalbuminuria, who had been receiving an
ace inhibitor prior to the study. although diabetes
was not an entry requirement, 87% of patients had
type 2 diabetes and 2% had type 1 diabetes. patients
were enrolled with an aer of 20–700 mug/min
(≈30–1000 mg/day); 70% of patients had microalbuminuria (aer <200 mug/min [≈300 mg/day]) and
30% had overt nephropathy (aer ≥200 mug/min) at
baseline. patients were randomized to 20 weeks’
treatment with ramipril 10 mg once daily plus
irbesartan 150–300 mg once daily or ramipril 10 mg
once daily plus placebo. additional antihypertensive therapy could be used to achieve target bp
(<130/80 mmhg), although not other ace inhibitors or  xxxg99xxx  receptor antagonists.
the reduction from baseline in aer (primary
endpoint) was not significantly greater with the
combination of ramipril plus irbesartan than with
ramipril plus placebo.[98] the adjusted baseline-toweek 20 geometric mean ratio decreased by 46%
with ramipril plus irbesartan and by 42% with
ramipril plus placebo (ratios of 0.539 vs 0.584) and
the difference between the groups (ratio of the adjusted mean ratios) was 0.922 (95% ci 0.711, 1.195;
p = 0.540). more patients receiving ramipril plus
irbesartan achieved target bp than with ramipril plus
placebo. subgroup analysis confirmed that there
was no significant between-treatment difference for
change in aer among those patients with microalbuminuria (n = 262), with a decrease of 41% in the
ramipril plus irbesartan group and 42% for ramipril
plus placebo. however, in the subgroup of patients
with diabetes (n = 321) geometric mean aer decreased by 43% in the ramipril-irbesartan group
compared with 37% for ramipril plus placebo (statistical comparison not reported).[98]

the progression of renal damage in hypertensive
patients with type 2 diabetes and nephropathy compared with amlodipine or placebo, and this effect
was at least partly independent of its bp-lowering
efficacy.[95]
this trial enrolled 1715 patients with hypertension, type 2 diabetes, proteinuria (≥900 mg/day) and
a raised serum creatinine level (1.2–3 mg/dl in men
and 1–3 mg/dl in women).[95] mean baseline glycated haemoglobin was 8.2%. patients were randomized to one of three treatment groups: irbesartan
titrated to 300 mg once daily (n = 579), amlodipine
titrated to 10 mg once daily (n = 567) or placebo
(n = 569). patients were followed-up for a minimum
of 2 years (mean 2.6 years). in order to achieve
target bp, a mean 3.0, 3.0 and 3.3 additional antihypertensive drugs were required in the irbesartan,
amlodipine and placebo groups, respectively.
the primary endpoint in idnt was a composite
of doubling of baseline serum creatinine level, onset
of esrd or death from any cause.[95] onset of
esrd was determined by the initiation of dialysis,
renal transplantation or a serum creatinine level
≥6 mg/dl. the secondary cardiovascular endpoint
was a composite of death from cardiovascular
causes, nonfatal myocardial infarction, heart failure
leading to hospitalization, cerebrovascular event
leading to a permanent neurological deficit, or leg
amputation above the ankle.
the proportions of patients reaching the composite primary endpoint, and its components, in idnt
are shown in table v. the unadjusted relative risk
(rr) of reaching the primary endpoint was 20%
lower in the irbesartan group than in the placebo
group (rr 0.80; 95% ci 0.66, 0.97; p = 0.02) and
23% lower than in the amlodipine group (rr 0.77;
95% ci 0.63, 0.93; p = 0.006).[95] among the component parts, the unadjusted rr of a doubling of
serum creatinine level was 33% lower with
irbesartan than with placebo (p = 0.003) and 37%
lower than with amlodipine (p < 0.001). although
the unadjusted rr of esrd was 23% lower with
irbesartan than either placebo or amlodipine, this did
not reach statistical significance (p = 0.07), and
there was also no significant difference between

difference between amlodipine and placebo for the

serum creatinine levels increased 24% more
slowly in the irbesartan group than in the placebo
group (p = 0.008) and 21% more slowly than in the
amlodipine group (p = 0.02); the mean annual rate of
change was 0.45 vs 0.57 vs 0.59 mg/dl/year for
irbesartan, amlodipine and placebo, respectively.[95]
proteinuria decreased by 33% with irbesartan compared with 6% with amlodipine and 10% with placebo during the study (statistical comparison not reported).[95]
there were no significant between-group differences for the secondary composite cardiovascular
endpoint.[95] however, compared with placebo, irbesartan was associated with a 23% lower rate of
congestive heart failure requiring hospitalization
and amlodipine was associated with a 41% lower
rate of nonfatal infarction (statistical analysis not
provided). a subsequent analysis of various cardiovascular outcomes showed a significantly lower incidence of congestive heart failure (most but not all
episodes requiring hospitalization) in the irbesartan
group compared with both placebo (hr 0.72; 95%
ci 0.52, 1.00; p = 0.048) and with amlodipine (hr
0.65; 95% ci 0.48, 0.87; p = 0.004).[104]

the irbesartan, amlodipine and placebo groups, respectively.[95] mean arterial pressure was lower by
3.3 mmhg in the active treatment groups compared
with the placebo group (p = 0.001 for both comparisons), while there was no significant difference between irbesartan and amlodipine. the rr of reaching the primary endpoint remained significantly
lower with irbesartan when adjusted for mean arterial pressure.[95] a post hoc analysis found that the
sbp achieved at study end was predictive of renal
outcomes, with reductions to 120 mmhg associated
with improved outcomes, but that irbesartan was
associated with an additional renoprotective effect,
independent of sbp.[8] treatment with irbesartan
reduced the risk of reaching a renal endpoint by an
additional 33% beyond the risk reduction achieved
through lowering sbp (p < 0.001).[8] it was also
estimated that the reduction in proteinuria seen
during the first 12 months of treatment with
irbesartan was associated with 36% of the overall
renoprotective effect seen.[10]
in a large observational study in which hypertensive patients with type 2 diabetes were treated with
irbesartan 75–300 mg once daily plus other antihypertensive medications if necessary (see section
5.1 for details), the proportion of patients who had
proteinuria decreased from 6.0% to 4.4% after
6 months, a rr reduction of 26.7% (p < 0.05).[99] in
another observational study, in which poorly controlled hypertensive patients (n = 1657) were

switched to irbesartan-based therapy, the proportion
of patients with macroalbuminuria decreased from
21% to 14% after 1 year (statistical comparison not
reported); however, it should be noted that only 48%
of patients (n = 802) in this study had diabetes.[100]
in the improve study (see section 5.1),[98]
which compared ramipril plus irbesartan with
ramipril plus placebo in hypertensive patients at
high cardiovascular risk (the majority of whom were
diabetic), subgroup analysis showed that among patients with overt nephropathy, mean aer decreased
by 58% in the combination therapy group compared
with 43% in the ramipril plus placebo group, suggesting the possibility of a benefit for dual ramiprilirbesartan therapy in this particular subgroup,
whereas there was no benefit for the overall population, most of whom had microalbuminuria. however, the subgroup was small (n = 108) and the 95%
confidence intervals were described as large (details
not reported), so this should be interpreted with
caution.[98]
6. tolerability
6.1 patients with hypertension

irbesartan was generally well tolerated by patients with mild to moderate hypertension. a pooled
analysis of data from 2606 patients participating in
nine randomized, placebo-controlled, multicentre
trials with a mean treatment duration of 9 weeks
found no significant difference between irbesartan
≤900 mg/day (n = 1965) and placebo (n = 641) for
the overall incidence of adverse events considered
possibly or probably related to treatment (21% vs
20%).[105] there was no relationship between dose
and incidence of adverse events; the incidence at
dosages of 600 or 900 mg/day (above the maximum
approved dosage) was similar to that for lower dosages.[105]
adverse events reported in ≥1% of irbesartan
recipients and at a numerically higher incidence than
with placebo in this pooled analysis included diarrhoea (3% vs 2%), dyspepsia/heartburn (2% vs 1%)
and fatigue (4% vs 3%).[106] orthostatic hypotension
occurred in 0.4% of the irbesartan group compared

1559

with 0.2% of the placebo group.[106] minor increases
in serum creatinine or blood urea nitrogen levels
occurred in similar proportions of irbesartan and
placebo recipients (0.7% vs 0.9%). adverse events
leading to discontinuation of therapy occurred in
3.3% and 4.5% of irbesartan and placebo recipients,
most commonly headache (0.6% with irbesartan vs
1.1% with placebo) and dizziness (0.3% in both
groups).[105] serious adverse events were reported
for 1.0% and 1.9% of the irbesartan and placebo
groups.[105] among 14 820 patients treated with
irbesartan 150 or 300 mg once daily for 11 weeks in
an open-label study, the incidence of adverse events
was 7.3% and serious adverse events occurred in
0.86% of patients.[90]
a pooled analysis of five noncomparative extension studies involving 1006 patients treated with
irbesartan ≤300 mg/day monotherapy found that it
was also generally well tolerated in the longer term
(mean 276 days).[89] adverse events were reported
by 20% of patients, with serious adverse events
occurring in 5.7% of patients and 6.3% discontinuing treatment because of an adverse event. events
that were reported by ≥5% of patients included
upper respiratory tract infection (11%), musculoskeletal pain (10%), headache (6%), dizziness and
cough (both 5%).[89] in a 6-month, noncomparative
observational postmarketing surveillance study in
4887 patients treated with irbesartan ≤300 mg/day,
the incidence of adverse events was low (2.2%) and
the most common events were headache (0.5%),
epigastralgia (0.4%), nausea/vomiting (0.4%) and
dizziness (0.3%).[107]
the overall incidence of adverse events with
irbesartan was generally similar to that with comparator agents, including other  xxxg99xxx  receptor
antagonists,[80-83,87] enalapril,[76-79]  xxxd113xxx ,[88] atenolol[84] and doxazosin.[45] however, the incidence
of cough was lower with irbesartan than with
enalapril in the five studies reporting tolerability
data for these agents (overall range 0–10% vs
8–21%);[76-79,86] in three of the four studies reporting
statistical analysis, the difference was significant
(p = 0.025,[79] p = 0.046[76] and p < 0.001[86]). for
example, in a 12-week japanese study in which
drugs 2008; 68 (11)

272 hypertensive patients were included in the safety analysis, the incidence of cough was 3.0% in the
irbesartan group compared with 21.2% in the
enalapril group (p < 0.001).[86] in addition, the incidence of adverse reactions (i.e. events for which a
causal relationship with the study drug could not be
ruled out) was also significantly lower with irbesartan than enalapril (11.9% vs 29.2%; p = 0.001).[86]
the incidence of adverse events was similar for
irbesartan and amlodipine in a trial in hypertension;[85] however, in patients with left ventricular
hypertrophy, the incidence of adverse events was
numerically lower with irbesartan than with amlodipine (3% vs 17%) and 13% of amlodipine recipients developed ankle oedema compared with none
in the irbesartan group (statistical analysis not reported).[50]
6.2 hypertensive diabetic patients
with nephropathy

the adverse event profile for irbesartan in patients with hypertension, type 2 diabetes and nephropathy was generally similar to that in patients
with hypertension.[106] however, in patients with
proteinuria and elevated serum creatinine levels
(idnt[95]), dizziness, orthostatic dizziness and orthostatic hypotension occurred numerically more
frequently with irbesartan 300 mg once daily than
with placebo (10.2% vs 6.0%, 5.4% vs 2.7% and
5.4% vs 3.2%, respectively; statistical analysis not
reported).[106] in addition, the incidence of hyperkalaemia (>6 meq/l) was numerically higher in the
irbesartan than the placebo group in idnt (18.6%
vs 6.0%). hyperkalaemia led to a significantly
higher rate of treatment discontinuation in the
irbesartan group than in the amlodipine or placebo
groups in this trial (1.9% vs 0.5% and 0.4%; p = 0.01
for both comparisons).[95] in idnt, the rate of adverse events per 1000 days of treatment was significantly lower with irbesartan than with amlodipine or
placebo (p = 0.002), while the number of serious
adverse events or discontinuations because of adverse events did not differ between the groups.[95]
among patients with microalbuminuria in irma
2, serious adverse events were reported for propor© 2008 adis data information bv. all rights reserved.

croom & plosker

tionally fewer patients in the combined irbesartan
150 and 300 mg once daily group than in the placebo
group (15.4% vs 22.8%; p = 0.02).[12] nonfatal
cardiovascular events occurred in 8.7% of the
irbesartan compared with 4.5% of the placebo group
(not statistically significant), while treatment discontinuation occurred in a similar proportion of
patients in both groups.[12]
in a large observational study in hypertensive
type 2 diabetic patients treated with irbesartan
(n = 31 793), just over one-third of whom had albuminuria, adverse events were reported by 0.3% of
patients and serious adverse events occurred in
0.05% of patients.[91]
7. pharmacoeconomic considerations
available pharmacoeconomic analyses for irbesartan concern its use in patients with hypertension
and type 2 diabetes with nephropathy.
the cost consequences of treatment with irbesartan have been estimated for the uk,[108] france and
belgium,[109] italy,[110] spain,[111] the us[112] and canada[113] using markov modelling based on the outcomes of idnt. the canadian study also included a
monte carlo simulation.[113] treatment-specific
probabilities were derived from idnt, while country-specific data on esrd and medication costs
were used. the perspective was that of the healthcare system for the us, uk (national health service) and italy,[108,110,112] and that of a third-party
payer for other european countries and canada.[109,111,113] the year of costing was 2000 for the
us,[112] 2001 for canada,[113] 2002 for france and
belgium,[109] 2003 for italy,[110] and was not stated
for the uk or spain. future costs and life expectancy were discounted at 3%,[109,111,112] 5%[110,113] or 6%
(costs) and 1.5% (life expectancy)[108] per annum.
all of the analyses found that irbesartan improved life expectancy and was cost saving compared with amlodipine or control therapy over 10and/or 25-year time horizons (table vi). control
therapy was standard antihypertensive treatment excluding ace inhibitors, other  xxxg99xxx  receptor antagonists and dihydropyridine calcium channel
antagonists, and corresponded to the placebo group

in idnt. irbesartan was also dominant based on the
monte carlo simulation.[113] sensitivity analyses
confirmed the results were robust. cost savings with
irbesartan compared with amlodipine were predicted to start after ≈3 years of treatment.[108,109,112]
several analyses indicated that most of the cost
savings were due to a reduction in costs associated
with the treatment of esrd.[108,109]
markov modelling has also been used to estimate
the cost consequences of early versus late initiation
of irbesartan treatment in the us,[114] france[115] and
asia.[116] all three models found that early initiation
of irbesartan (when microalbuminuria was detected)
was projected to improve life expectancy and reduce
costs compared with later initiation (when advanced
overt nephropathy was present). for example, over a
25-year time horizon in the us model, early treat-

ment increased life expectancy by 1.48 years
(0.92 years discounted at 3%) compared with late
treatment, with the improvement apparent after
5 years.[114] in this model, early irbesartan was associated with per-patient cost savings of $us8670
compared with late therapy (year 2000 costs; thirdparty payer perspective), with the saving evident
after 11 years.[114] these models also confirmed that
both early and late initiation of irbesartan increased
life expectancy and led to cost savings compared
with control therapy (standard therapy as previously
described).[114-116] another modelled analysis found
that annual screening for albuminuria using dipstick
testing, followed by the addition of irbesartan to the
antihypertensive treatment regimen if the test was
positive, was associated with improved outcomes
and was cost saving in france.[117]

8. dosage and administration
irbesartan tablets are approved in many countries
worldwide (including japan in april 2008) for the
treatment of adults with essential hypertension.
irbesartan is also approved in a number of countries,
including europe, the us and canada, for the treatment of nephropathy in patients with hypertension
and type 2 diabetes. this section is based on the
european summary of product characteristics[118]
except where indicated otherwise. the usual dosage
for the treatment of hypertension is 150 mg once
daily, but it may be increased to 300 mg once
daily.[118] in clinical trials in japanese patients with
hypertension, a dosage range of 50–200 mg once
daily was evaluated.[86,87] in hypertensive patients
with type 2 diabetes, a maintenance dose of 300 mg
once daily is recommended, as this dosage is effective in the treatment of nephropathy.[118]
the tablets can be taken with or without food.
dosage adjustments are not usually needed in elderly patients or in patients with renal impairment or
mild to moderate hepatic impairment.[118] volumeor salt-depletion should be corrected prior to administering irbesartan. concomitant use of lithium
or agents that can increase serum potassium levels is
not recommended. irbesartan is contraindicated in
the second and third trimesters of pregnancy and
during lactation.[118] on the basis of an epidemiological study showing an association between exposure
to ace inhibitors during the first trimester of pregnancy and the risk of congenital malformations,[119]
some clinicians suggest that, until further studies are
conducted, it may also be necessary to avoid treatment with other ras-blocking drugs, including
 xxxg99xxx  receptor antagonists, at any time
during pregnancy, even in the first trimester.[120]
local prescribing information should be consulted
for detailed prescribing information, including other
contraindications, warnings, precautions, drug interactions and information on use in special patient
populations.

9. place of irbesartan in the
management of hypertension and
diabetic nephropathy
hypertension affects more than one-quarter of
the adult population worldwide.[1] it is associated
with an increased risk of cardiovascular events and
renal disease.[3,121] lowering bp reduces the risk,
and major guidelines generally recommend that bp
is reduced to <140/90 mmhg, with a lower target of
<130/80 mmhg for those with diabetes or chronic
renal disease.[3,6,122]
many patients will need pharmacotherapy, in
addition to lifestyle modifications, to help control
their bp.[3,6,122] the major classes of antihypertensive agents provide broadly similar antihypertensive
efficacy, and so the choice of drug may depend on
other factors, such as concurrent diseases, adverse
drug effects in individuals and cost.[3,6,122] based on
major clinical trials, guidelines recognize some particular indications favouring the use of certain drug
classes.[3] for example,  xxxg99xxx  receptor antagonists are among the drugs recommended for patients with diabetes, chronic renal failure or heart
failure,[3] and can also be considered after a myocardial infarction and for patients with left ventricular
hypertrophy, atrial fibrillation or the metabolic syndrome.[6]
irbesartan is an  xxxg99xxx  receptor type 1
antagonist that provides antihypertensive efficacy
over a 24-hour period with once-daily administration (section 4). in clinical trials in patients with
mild to moderate hypertension, it was as effective at
lowering bp as comparator agents from other classes, including enalapril, amlodipine and atenolol,
and, based on a single trial, was more effective than
doxazosin. in addition, irbesartan and the renin inhibitor  xxxd113xxx  exhibited similar efficacy when
both drugs were administered at their recommended
starting dosage. in comparison with other  xxxg99xxx  receptor antagonists, irbesartan was at least as
effective as losartan and, based on single trials, more
effective than  xxxd3487xxx  but less effective at reducing
dbp than olmesartan. the usual dosages of irbesartan in these trials were 150–300 mg once daily;
however, in japanese patients, dosages of
drugs 2008; 68 (11)

irbesartan: a review

50–200 mg once daily were effective (section 4).
irbesartan shows dose-dependent antihypertensive
efficacy, and a large open-label study showed that
patients who do not respond to 150 mg once daily
may show a response to 300 mg once daily, and
without an increase in adverse events (section
4.3).[90] there are no published data comparing the
efficacy of irbesartan in black and non-black patients; however, the european summary of product
characteristics indicates that black hypertensive patients have a lower response to irbesartan monotherapy, which is consistent with other  xxxg99xxx 
receptor antagonists and ace inhibitors.[118]
in hypertensive patients with left ventricular hypertrophy, irbesartan reduced left ventricular mass
to a greater extent than amlodipine or atenolol (section 2.1). it also reduced qt and qtc interval dispersion in these patients, which theoretically could
reduce the risk of arrhythmias.[51] however, although another  xxxg99xxx  receptor antagonist,
losartan, has been shown to reduce cardiovascular
morbidity and mortality in hypertensive patients
with left ventricular hypertrophy,[123] data for such
outcomes are not available for irbesartan.
many patients with hypertension require treatment with more than one antihypertensive drug in
order to achieve adequate control of their bp,[3,6,122]
and in many countries irbesartan is approved for
use in combination with other antihypertensive
agents.[118,124] in particular, irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide have been shown to have an additive
effect,[7] and a fixed-dose combination tablet containing these two drugs is widely available.[125] in
addition, irbesartan has a low propensity for drug
interactions (section 3.2), which is a useful characteristic when considering that patients with hypertension may need to take a combination of antihypertensive drugs as well as other medications for
concurrent conditions. combination therapy with
irbesartan was not within the remit of this article, but
has been reviewed previously.[7,124]
the combination of hypertension and diabetes is
associated with a particularly high risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, and also renal
damage (which, in turn, is itself associated with

increased cardiovascular risk[126]).[3,6] for example,
among patients with hypertension, type 2 diabetes
and overt nephropathy enrolled in idnt, >30%
experienced one or more cardiovascular events
during a median follow-up of 2.6 years.[127] consequently, antihypertensive therapy is an important
element of treatment for diabetic patients, particularly those with incipient or overt nephropathy.[128]
aggressive control of bp can reduce the risk of
nephropathy and cardiovascular events in patients
with type 2 diabetes.[129] moreover, drugs that block
the ras appear to have a specific renoprotective
effect in addition to that attributable to their bplowering activity.[129]
consequently, hypertension[3,6,122] and diabeguidelines recommend using ace inhibitors and  xxxg99xxx  receptor antagonists in patients with hypertension and type 2 diabetes. the
american diabetes association specifically recommends using  xxxg99xxx  receptor antagonists in
those with macroalbuminuria and renal insufficiency, and either ace inhibitors or  xxxg99xxx  receptor antagonists in patients with microalbuminuria.[131]
tes[130,131]

a number of large trials have shown that  xxxg99xxx  receptor antagonists, including irbesartan,
reduce the progression of microalbuminuria[12,132,133]
and overt nephropathy[95,134] in hypertensive patients
with type 2 diabetes, and this effect is not solely
attributable to changes in bp.[12,27,95,133] these trials
include irma 2 and idnt with irbesartan (section
5). in irma 2, irbesartan significantly delayed
the progression from microalbuminuria to overt nephropathy compared with placebo, and restored
normoalbuminuria in a greater number of patients.[12] in idnt, compared with both placebo and
amlodipine, irbesartan delayed the progression of
renal damage in patients who already had overt
nephropathy.[95]
the greater renoprotective effect seen with
irbesartan than with amlodipine in idnt occurred
despite both drugs causing a similar reduction in bp
(section 5.2).[95] similarly, in a subgroup of patients
in irma 2 who had similar reductions in ambulatory bp regardless of treatment, irbesartan was assodrugs 2008; 68 (11)

1564

ciated with a significantly greater reduction in aer
than placebo (section 5.1).[12] in a different substudy
of irma 2, the renoprotective effect of irbesartan
300 mg once daily was sustained 1 month after
stopping antihypertensive therapy, despite bp increasing during that period;[103] in another trial,
irbesartan reduced aer to a similar extent in hypertensive and normotensive patients with diabetes, but
only reduced bp in the hypertensive patients.[97]
taken together, these data support the renoprotective effect of irbesartan being in part independent of
its effects on bp.
the mechanism by which  xxxg99xxx  receptor
antagonists confer a specific renoprotective effect
has not yet been fully elucidated.  xxxg99xxx  can
stimulate growth factors and cytokines, cause glomerular hypertension, glomerular sclerosis, and alter the glomerular basement membrane and its filtration properties, all of which could contribute to renal
damage in patients with diabetes.[128]  xxxg99xxx 
antagonists could reduce the effect of these factors
on the kidney, in addition to their haemodynamic
effects. irbesartan has been shown to reduce oxidative stress and inflammation, and to improve endothelial function and the functioning of the filtration
barrier in the kidney (section 2), which could contribute towards its renoprotective effects.
both ace inhibitors and  xxxg99xxx  receptor
antagonists have been shown to reduce the risk of
cardiovascular events in hypertensive patients with
type 2 diabetes and evidence of nephropathy.[128]
while idnt included a cardiovascular endpoint (a
composite of death from cardiovascular causes, nonfatal myocardial infarction, heart failure leading to
hospitalization, stroke or leg amputation), the study
was not powered to detect a difference in this secondary endpoint, and, indeed, there was no significant
difference between irbesartan and amlodipine or
placebo (section 5.2).[95] however, in a subsequent
analysis evaluating various cardiovascular endpoints,[104] the incidence of congestive heart failure
(most but not all episodes leading to hospitalization)
was significantly lower among recipients of irbesartan compared with amlodipine or placebo (section
5.2), and further evaluation of the effects of

croom & plosker

irbesartan on cardiovascular endpoints in this population would be of interest.
irbesartan is generally well tolerated, and in clinical trials the overall incidence of adverse events
was similar to that seen with comparator agents
(section 6). some patients taking ace inhibitors
develop a  xxxd1861xxx , and  xxxg99xxx  receptor
antagonists can be a useful alternative treatment in
this situation. indeed, irbesartan was associated with
a lower incidence of cough than enalapril in comparative clinical trials (section 6). drugs that block the
ras can cause hyperkalaemia, particularly in patients with renal impairment.[135] in idnt, in which
patients had proteinuria and elevated serum creatinine levels, more patients receiving irbesartan discontinued treatment because of hyperkalaemia than
in the amlodipine or placebo groups; however, the
rate of discontinuation due to hyperkalaemia with
irbesartan was still low (<2%) [section 6].
a number of modelled pharmacoeconomic analyses based on idnt suggest that treatment with
irbesartan in hypertensive patients with type 2 diabetes and nephropathy improves life expectancy and
is cost saving in the long term compared with
amlodipine or placebo (section 7). pharmacoeconomic studies comparing irbesartan with other
 xxxg99xxx  receptor antagonists and with ace
inhibitors would be of interest.
in addition to hypertension and diabetic nephropathy, drugs that affect the ras have potential for the
treatment of various other disorders. ace inhibitors
reduce morbidity and mortality in patients with heart
failure and, based on large trials involving losartan,
candesartan and  xxxd3487xxx ,  xxxg99xxx  receptor
antagonists present a suitable alternative for patients
who are not able to tolerate ace inhibitors.[128] in
addition, the combination of an ace inhibitor and
an  xxxg99xxx  receptor antagonist may be of
benefit in some patients with heart failure,[128] and
small trials have suggested that adding irbesartan to
ace inhibitor therapy in patients with heart failure
may be beneficial.[136,137] in patients with heart failure with preserved systolic function, candesartan
has been shown to reduce morbidity,[138] and a small
study suggested that adding irbesartan to diuretics in
drugs 2008; 68 (11)

irbesartan: a review

such patients improved left ventricular function
slightly, although it did not improve symptoms.[139]
a large trial currently underway, i-preserve
(irbesartan in heart failure with preserved systolic
function; n = 4100), will provide more information
on irbesartan in patients with diastolic heart failure.[140]
blockade of the ras may also be beneficial in
patients with atrial fibrillation,[6] and the active
(atrial fibrillation clopidogrel trials with irbesartan for prevention of vascular events) programme
includes an ongoing assessment of the effect of
adding irbesartan to clopidogrel and aspirin on the
risk of cardiovascular events in these patients.[141]
these two large studies will help clarify the potential role of irbesartan in other cardiovascular disorders.
in conclusion, irbesartan is an effective antihypertensive agent that also slows the progression of
renal disease in hypertensive patients with type 2
diabetes. in addition, irbesartan was generally well
tolerated in clinical trials. thus, irbesartan is a useful treatment option for patients with hypertension,
including those with type 2 diabetes and nephropathy.
