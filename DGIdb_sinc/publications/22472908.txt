comparison of the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetic profile of a single oral dose of  xxxd2970xxx  4 mg in adult subjects with severe renal ...   xxxd2970xxx  is a novel statin recently approved in the united states as an adjunctive therapy with diet to reduce elevated total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol,  xxxg175xxx , and triglycerides and to increase high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. this open-label study enrolled 16 subjects as follows: group a: 8 adult subjects with severe renal impairment who were not on hemodialysis (estimated glomerular filtration rate of 15-29 ml/min/1.73 m2) and group b: 8 healthy adult subjects (estimated glomerular filtration rate â‰¥80 ml/min/1.73 m2). on day 1, the subjects received a single oral dose of  xxxd2970xxx  4 mg and remained in the clinic on days 1-3 for safety and pharmacokinetic assessments. comparing group a with group b, the geometric mean ratio of auc(0-inf) for  xxxd2970xxx  was 1.36 (90% confidence interval, 0.88-2.11). for cmax, the corresponding ratio was 1.18 (90% confidence interval, 0.68-2.02). there were no severe treatment-emergent adverse events (aes), serious aes, deaths, or treatment-emergent aes leading to study drug discontinuation. a single dose of  xxxd2970xxx  4 mg was safe and well tolerated by the subjects in this study with severe renal impairment, who were not on hemodialysis.
