summary
synopsis

loratadine is a long-acting antihistamine agent, exhibiting partial selectivity for
peripheral histamine hi-receptors. to date, loratadine has been evaluated in
allergic rhinitis, urticaria and, to a limited extent, in asthma.
in several large controlled comparative clinical studies, loratadine was superior to placebo, faster acting than  xxxd236xxx  and as effective as  xxxd255xxx , cetirizine, chlorpheniramine ( xxxd1676xxx ), clemastine , hydroxyzine,  xxxd2572xxx 
and terfenadine in patients with allergic rhinitis and chronic urticaria. the clinical effectiveness of loratadine in asthma is at present unclear.
loratadine is well tolerated . at dosages of iomg daily, commonly reported
adverse events were somnolence, fatigue and headache . sedation occurred less
frequently with loratadine than with  xxxd255xxx , cetirizine, chlorpheniramine,
clemastine and  xxxd2572xxx . serious ventricular arrhythmias , as reported with
some other second generation histamine hi-receptor antagonists, have not been
observed with loratadine to date.
thus, loratadine, with its attributes ofonce daily administration, fast onset of
action and essentially nonsedating properties, would appear to be an appropriate
first-line agent for the treatment ofallergic rhinitis or urticaria.

pharmacological
properties

loratadine is a long-acting antihistamine agent which exhibits partial selectivity
for histamine hi-receptors in vitro. it displays weak in vitro affinity for cholinergic receptors and n-adrenoceptors, while no anticholinergic effects have been
observed in animal models.
in studies of its antihistaminic activity in humans, both the magnitude and
duration of wheal suppression by loratadine in response to intradermally injected
histamine are dose-related. direct comparison of single doses of various histamine hi-receptor antagonists in healthy volunteers , using this standard model,
revealed the following order of activity: cetirizine lomg > terfenadine 120mg >
terfenadine 60mg > loratadine 10mg >  xxxd236xxx  10mg > chlorpheniramine
( xxxd1676xxx ) 4mg > placebo. onset of antihistaminic action with loratadine,
as measured by wheal and flare suppression, was apparent within the first hour
of administration, and was sustained for up to 24 hours. loratadine 10 to 20mg
exhibits a protective effect on airways in response to inhaled histamine challenge
in patients with asthma.
the antiallergic activity of loratadine has been demonstrated in humans, using
cutaneous, nasal challenge and conjunctival provocation tests. loratadine , however, does not attenuate early or late airways responses to inhaled allergens.
significant eeg effects were not observed in guinea-pigs given single intravenous doses of loratadine up to 100mg/kg, or in healthy human volunteers given
oral dosages of loratadine 40 mg/day for a period of 3 months. at dosages of up
to 40 mg/day, loratadine does not appear to impair psychomotor function or potentiate the depressant effects of alcohol in healthy volunteers .

loratadine: a review

pharmacokinetic
properties

following oral administration, loratadine is well absorbed, with peak plasma
concentrations of 24.3 to 30.5 ilg/l occurring between 1 and 1.5 hours after
ingestion of a 40mg capsule . both loratadine and its major active metabolite,
 xxxd1846xxx  (dcl) exhibit dose proportional pharmacokinetics after single- and multiple-dose administration.
loratadine is 97 to 99% plasma protein bound and has a large volume of
distribution (119 l/kg) . distribution half-lives (t l/2u) in both single- (20 and 40mg)
and multiple-dose loratadine studies (40mg once daily) range from 0.9 to 1.0
hours. while loratadine is excreted into breastmilk, the amount of an administered
dose appearing in the milk is minimal.
loratadine is extensively metabolised by hydroxylation. plasma elimination
half-lives (tl/2~) of loratadine in single-dose studies (20 to 40mg) ranged from 7.8
to ii hours . at steady-state, a tl/2~ value of 14.4 hours was documented following
administration of loratadine 40 mg/day for 10 days. haemodialysis appears to
have a negligible effect on loratadine clearance.
although ketoconazole, erythromycin and cimetidine inhibit the metabolism
of loratadine, these pharmacokinetic interactions appear to be of little or no clinical significance. where ecg parameters were measured, adverse cardiovascular
effects were not observed as a result of elevated plasma concentrations of loratadine or dcl.

therapeutic efficacy

in large comparative trials of patients with seasonal allergic rhinitis, short term
therapy (2 to 3 weeks) with loratadine at therapeutic doses was significantly
superior to placebo, and as effective as  xxxd255xxx , cetirizine, clemastine,
 xxxd2572xxx  or terfenadine. loratadine was faster acting than  xxxd236xxx , and was
effective in relieving nasal, conjunctival and other non-nasal symptoms . combination therapy with loratadine iomg and pseudoephedrine 240mg (as a single
daily dose or in 2 divided doses) may further improve nasal symptoms associated
with allergic rhinitis . in children and/or adolescents with seasonal allergic rhinitis,
loratadine was as effective as  xxxd236xxx , chlorpheniramine, dexchlorpheniramine and terfenadine in alleviating symptoms, but less effective than intranasal
fluticasone in relieving symptoms of nasal blockage .
similarly, at therapeutic doses loratadine was as efficacious as clemastine or
terfenadine over treatment periods of up to 6 months in perennial rhinitis: nasal
stuffiness, post-nasal drainage and nasal discharge were reduced by approximately 50% with loratadine.
comparable symptomatic improvement was noted with therapeutic doses of
loratadine, clemastine, hydroxyzine and terfenadine over treatment periods of up
to 12 weeks in patients with chronic urticaria . preliminary data also suggest that
adjuvant treatment with loratadine may relieve pruritic symptoms in patients with
atopic dermatitis.
in acute coryza, combined therapy with loratadine 5mg and pseudoephedrine
120mg as 1 tablet taken twice daily may provide some symptomatic relief.
whether this combination provides additional relief of cold symptoms over pseudoephedrine monotherapy remains to be confirmed.
the clinical effectiveness of loratadine in the treatment of asthma remains
unclear. conflicting results and small patient numbers in studies conducted to date
provide inconclusive results and thus do not support its use in asthma at present.

tolerability

loratadine is generally well tolerated at therapeutic doses in adults, elderly patients and children. in a review of 15 noncomparative studies in which some 55000

patients received loratadine 10 mg/day, commonly reported adverse events were
somnolence, fatigue and headaches (=< 1%), while dry mouth and gastrointestinal
upset occurred less frequently. loratadine was less sedating than  xxxd255xxx ,
cetirizine, clemastine, chlorpheniramine and  xxxd2572xxx .
serious ventricular arrhythmias, reported with some second generation histamine hi-receptor antagonists (e.g. terfenadine and  xxxd236xxx ), have not been
observed with loratadine to date, although rare cases of supraventricular tachycardia have been reported.
the tolerability of a combination preparation of loratadine 5mg with pseudoephedrine 120mg, taken twice daily, was comparable with pseudoephedrine
monotherapy, but produced a significantly greater incidence of dry mouth and
insomnia in comparison with placebo and loratadine alone.
in reported cases of overdosage with loratadine, recovery was uneventful.
accidental overdosage in 5 young children at loratadine dosages 10 to 20 times
greater than those recommended produced no adverse cardiac events.
dosage and
administration

at present, loratadine is indicated for the relief of symptoms associated with
allergic rhinitis, urticaria and other allergic dermatological disorders. the recommended dose ofloratadine is iomg once daily for adults and for children weighing
more than 30kg. children aged 2 to 12 years and weighing less than 30kg should
receive 5mg once daily.
in adults, i combination tablet (loratadine 5mg and pseudoephedrine 120mg)
is recommended twice daily for symptomatic relief of the common cold.
although dosage adjustments may be necessary in patients with hepatic impairment, this is unlikely to be required in either elderly patients or those with
renal impairment.

loratadine is a long-acting antihistamine drug,
exhibiting partial selectivity for peripheral histamine h r-receptors. structurally related to its analogue,  xxxd255xxx , loratadine lacks cns penetration
and associated sedative and anticholinergic effects
(fig. i).
the pharmacology and clinical use ofloratadine
were previously assessed by clissold et al.ul since
this time, further information regarding the use of
the drug in allergic disease has been reported. this
updated review re-evaluates the role of loratadine
in the treatment of allergic disease and examines
its potential role in asthma. key data from the previous review are provided, supplemented by newer
data where relevant.

effects in the guinea-pig persisted longer after single oral dose administration of loratadine (18
hours) than after terfenadine or  xxxd255xxx  (6 to 8
hours»)4)
histamine-induced bronchospasm in the
guinea-pig was also inhibited to a greater extent by
loratadine than terfenadine.pl antihistaminic potency, expressed as the effective oral dose required
to inhibit intravenous histamine-induced bronchoconstriction in the guinea-pig by 40% (ed40), was
greater for loratadine (0.08 mg/kg) than terfenadine (0.44 mg/kg) and diphenhydramine (5
mg/kg»)6)
7.2.2 in humans

studies using human basophils from both allergic and non-allergic volunteers indicate that
loratadine and its metabolite,  xxxd1846xxx , inhibit in vitro ige-induced histamine
release at a cellular level; for both compounds, a
dose-dependent inhibition of histamine release
was observed at concentrations above 2.5 umol/l
with total inhibition occurring at 25 umol/l. thi s

inhibition of histamine release has been linked to
a decrease in influx and mobilisation of ca 2+ from
the endoplasmic reticulump,8]
the suppressant effect of oral histamine h1receptor antagonists on histamine-induced skin
wheals is well established. intradermal injection of
histamine induces a wheal formation surrounded
by a local flare . using this standard model, the
wheal response to intradermally injected histamine
2jlg was assessed in healthy volunteers pretreated
with single oral doses of loratadine 10 to 80mg)9)
onset of wheal suppression was observed within 1
to 2 hours of loratadine administration.p-lvl both
the magnitude (35 to 67%) and duration (12 to 48
hours) of wheal suppression by loratadine were
dose related. the inhibitory effect of loratadine on
histamine-induced wheal formation was also significantly greater than that of placebo.pl
direct comparison of antihistaminic activity of
histamine hi-receptor antagonists, as assessed by
suppression of histamine-induced wheal and flare
following single oral dose administration to
healthy volunteers, revealed the following order of
potency: cetirizine iomg > terfenadine 120mg >
terfenadine 60mg > loratadine 10mg >  xxxd236xxx 
10mg > chlorpheniramine ( xxxd1676xxx ) 4mg
> placebo.utl other studies comparing oral doses
of loratadine 10 to 40mg with cetirizine 2.5 to
10mg confirm the greater potency of cetirizine in
suppressing histamine-induced skin reactions in
both healthyfi2-14) and atopic volunteers)12,15,16)
inhibition of histamine-induced wheal and flare by
loratadine has also been described in atopic children)17)
loratadine differed significantly from cetirizine, terfenadine,  xxxd236xxx  and chlorpheniramine
with regard to onset of antihistaminic action and
duration of response (fig . 2): while some degree of
inhibition of histamine-induced wheal and flare
was evident within the first hour of loratadine administration, significant inhibitory effects were
observed much later (4 hours) compared with other
agents (1 to 2 hours). the antihistaminic effect of
loratadine was sustained for at least 24 hours after
dose ingestion compared with placebo, but only for

allergic rhinitis , however, does not correlate with
these data; in particular, symptomatic relief may be
observed within 30 minutes of dose ingestion (section 3.1). although inhibition of histamine-induced
skin reactivity is often used to assess antihistamine
activity and potential clinical efficacy, other models such as nasal challenge method s may provide
better in vivo correlations of clinical efficacy.

a statistically significant protective response . more
recently, 5 of 6 patients with chronic obstructive
bronchitis or extrinsi c asthma showed complete
protection against histamine-induced bronchoconstriction with loratadine 10 mg/day.u'']
the duration of effect of histamine hi-receptor
antagonists on bronchial responsiveness following
histamine challenge shows considerable inter-drug
and inter-patient variation. administration of a 1week course of loratadine 10 mg/day blocked the
bronchial response to histamine for a mean of 9.1
days post-treatment; cutaneous responsiveness to
histamine was inhibited for a similar period of 6.9
days.l20] these effects were comparable to those
observed with terfenadine (7.2 days for both parameters) but considerably shorter than those seen
with other agents such as  xxxd236xxx  (inhibition of
histamine-induced bronchial response, mean duration 42 days).l2l]
while chronic administration of first generation
histamine h r-receptor antagonists has traditionall y been associated with the development of
tachyphylaxis, the newer agents, loratadine, terfenadine and cetirizine, do not appear to induce this
subsensitivity.l22,23] this phenomenon did not develop during a 4-week course of loratadine 10 to
40 mg/day in healthy volunteers.u''l continued
use of loratadine 10 mg/day for up to 12 weeks in
atopic patients confirmed this observation; skin reactivity to histamine or allergen remained suppressed for the duration of the study.l22]
1.3 ant iallergic activity

the antiallergic properties of loratadine have
been studied in vitro, as well as in animals and
humans. in humans , the antiallergic activity of
loratadine has been assessed using skin prick
tests, ocular, nasal and bronchial challenge methods.l 18,24-26]

relea se)27] more recently, loratadine was also
shown to inhibit anti-ige-induced leukotriene c4
release from human leucocytes in vitro with an
icso value of 4 ~molll)28 1 in vivo, howe ver, administration ofloratadine 20 mg/day for 8 days had
no effect on leukotriene b4 and e4 release into skin
chambers of atopic volunteers.p''l
in vitro, loratadine 10 to 50 ug/linhibited  xxxd2973xxx -induced human eosinophil
chemotaxis by 32 to 56%)30] no changes in histamine- or antigen-induced eosinophil migration to
skin challenge sites were apparent following administration of loratadine lomg to atopic patients ,115] although reductions in blood and sputum
eosinophil counts have been noted in treated patients)3l] significant decreases in activated lymphocytes (cells expressing hla-dr antigen , interleukin-2 receptors or proliferating cell nuclear
antigen ) were observed within the nasal muco sa of
atopic patients treated with loratadine 10 mg/day
for i month)32] a corre sponding improvement in
symptoms was noted in these patients.
increa sed nasal vasopermeability is one factor
involved in the production of muco sal oedema and
subsequent nasal blockage. in the guinea-pig, a
dose-dependent inhibition of allergen-induced nasal vasopermeability was observed with loratadine
0.15 to 10 mg/kg, with the highe st dose producing
80% inhibition of response.uel
oral admini stration of loratadine has been
shown to inhibit serotonin-induced bronchospasm
and bronchospasm associated with allergic anaphylaxis in guinea-pigs and rats, respectiveiy.pl in
both test models loratadine was more potent than
terfenadine.
early work in humans suggested that loratadine
posse sses greater cutaneous antiallergic activity
than  xxxd236xxx )26] loratadine, however, appears
less effective in reducing antigen (grass and tree
pollen)-induced cutaneous inflammation than
other newer antihistamine agents. in atopic patient s, cutaneous inflammation was unaffected by
a single dose of loratadine lomg, whereas cetirizine l omg and terfenadine 120mg showed signifie adis interna tional umited. all rights reserved .

cant inhibitory effects in comparison with placebo)is,34] cutaneous reactivity to allergen (grass
or mite) was suppressed over a 12-week treatment
period with loratadine 10 mg/day in patient s with
allergen sensitivity)22] wheals induced by house
dust mites have been noted to respond less favourably to histamine hi-receptor antagonists (loratadine, cetirizine and  xxxd236xxx ) than those induced
by histamine.u'il pretreatment with loratadine 10
mg/day for 5 days partly inhibited allergen-induced
increased dermal blood flow in atopic vol unteers)3s]
allergen-induced histamine release into nasal
lavage following intranasal grass and tree pollen
challenge was inhibited by pretreatment with
loratadine 10 mg/day for 5 to 7 days)24,36] this
observation is indicative of in vivo mast cell
stabilisation by loratadine. 137] loratadine also
showed a protective effect against inflammatory
cell recruitment at the conjunctival site following
antigen (pollen ) challenge in patients with seasonal
allergic rhiniti s)2s,38] pretreatment with loratadine
10 mg/d ay for i week significantly reduced the
total number of inflammatory cells (neutrophils,
eosinophils, lymphocytes and monocytes) during
early (30 minute s) and late (6 hours) phase reactions following allergen provocarion.u'tl
recent work suggests that loratadine does not
attenuate early and late airway responses to inhaled
allergens) 18] although dose-related inhibition of
the immediate skin wheal response to allergen was
noted with loratadine in 12 patients with atopic
asthma, loratadine 10 to 20 mg/day for 3 days afforded no protective effect against early or late
bronchoconstrictor responses to inhaled allergen .
1.4 sedative and psychomotor effects

the ability of a drug to cros s the blood-brain
barrier is an important determinant of its effect on
alertness and performance. the newer nonsedating
antihi stamines are large lipophobic molecules with
a charged side chain; they therefore do not readily
cro ss the blood-brain barrier. in addition, these
agent s may possess greater selecti vity for periphdrugs 48 (4) 1994

eral rather than central histamine hi-receptor
sites[23,391 (section 1.1).
at doses considerably higher than those required for antihistaminic activity, loratadine did
not significantly influence behavioural, neurological or autonomic function in various animal models.!4,401
initial studies in healthy volunteers indicate that
loratadine, at doses of 10,[41-431 20[41j and 40
mg/day[43j for i to 2 days, does not impair psychomotor performance, as assessed by sleep latency,
symbol copying, digit symbol substitution, and dynamic visual acuity. in one study, however, some
impairment of function (digit symbol substitution,
dynamic visual acuity) was observed at the higher
loratadine 40mg dose.l"! jslight, dose-related electroencephalographic changes were also noted 2
hours after single dose ingestion of loratadine 10
or 40mg in volunteers.uvl in comparison, both
clemastine i mg(44) and cetirizine lomg[45j have
been shown to impair psychomotor function.
on concurrent administration, loratadine 10 or
40mg did not appear to potentiate the depressant
effect of alcohol on subjective or objective measures of psychomotor performance, including driving performance, in healthy volunteers.!44-46j
learning in children may be reduced by allergic
conditions such as seasonal allergic rhinitis.!47j
results from a recent study, involving 73 children
aged 10 to 12 years, indicate that learning performance was superior in those atopic children treated
with a single oral dose of loratadine 10mg than
placebo or diphenhydramine 25mg (2 doses given
4 hours apart). all 3 groups were inferior to healthy
controls. whether this is a direct effect of the drug
or secondary to improvement in rhinitis is unclear
from the data presented. further comparative studies with nonsedating histamine hi-receptor antagonists using multiple dosages are also required to
ascertain the clinical advantages of loratadine in
terms of learning.
1.5 cardiovascular effects
recent reports indicate that some second generation histamine h i-receptor antagonists (such as
© adi s international limited. all rights reserved.

terfenadine and  xxxd236xxx ) are associated with serious cardiovascular effects, either when taken at
dosages exceeding maximum recommendations,
given to 'at-risk' patients with pre-existing cardiovascular disease or hepatic dysfunction, or administered in combination with medications that inhibit their own metabolism, e.g . erythromycin,
clarithromycin, ketoconazole, or itraconazole.!48,49] in particular, prolonged ecg qt c intervals (500 to 550 msec) have been recognised as
an important risk factor for the development of torsade de pointes, and this complication has been
observed more commonly in situations that result
in higher than normal plasma concentrations of
some histamine hi-receptor antagonists .d''l
the mechanism by which terfenadine induces
adverse cardiac effects is currently postulated to
involve blockade of the delayed rectifier potassium
current (ik), which primarily controls the duration
of the qt c interval.!49j in an in vitro study of several histamine h i-receptor antagonists performed
in guinea-pig ventricular myocytes, concentrations
of 10 and 100 umol/l of terfenadine, loratadine,
cetirizine and hydroxyzine blocked cardiac ik, sodium or fast (ina), and calcium or slow (lea) currents.! 511 the researchers concluded that the 4
drugs had approximately similar effects on membrane conductance at these concentrations. however, subsequent work in the same tissue indicates
that loratadine does not block the ik current at
lower concentrations ranging from 0.0 i to 10
umol/l, with 10 umol/l equating to approximately
800 times the plasma concentration achieved clinically (data on file, schering plough; woosley &
darrow(521). by comparison, in vitro studies in isolated cat ventricular myocyte showed that both terfenadine and  xxxd236xxx  block the ik current at
concentrations of 10 urnol/l or lower;[49,53j in the
case of terfenadine, a concentration of 1 umol/l
produced almost complete block, whereas 0.15
umol/l produced half-maximal block.! 491
comparative in vivo data in the guinea-pig suggest that loratadine is less likely to cause adverse
cardiovascular effects than terfenadine. administration of a single intravenous dose of loratadine

ecgs performed at baseline, weeks 3, 5, 9, and
13 in 50 healthy volunteers receiving loratadine
40mg once daily (recommended dose 10mg once
daily) over a period of3 month s revealed no statistically significant change s in ecg parameters or
evidence of qt c interval prolongation.l 56,57 1mean
baseline qt c intervals of 390 and 38 i msec increased to 393 and 386 msec at day 90, for loratadine and placebo, respectively. in addition, dizziness, syncope or ventricular tachyarrhythmias
were not observed.
thus, from the available experimental evidence, it seems unlikely that loratadine has a propensity to cause seriou s cardiotoxicity at therapeutic dosages. indeed in clinical usage, there have
been no confirmed reports of torsade de pointes or
other ventricular tachyarrhythmias with loratadine
to date.l 52l further data pertaining to the cardiovascular effects of loratadine are discussed in sections
2.6 and 4.
2. overview of pharmacokinetic
properties

to date, understanding of the pharmacokinetic
properties of loratadine is based mainly on studies
that recruited healthy volunteers (including the elderly and lactating women) and patients with renal
and hepatic impairment. while the recommended
daily dose of loratadine is 10mg, virtually all pharmacokinetic studies have evaluated doses exceeding this, notably 40mg in either a single-dose or
multiple-dose regimens. loratadine exhibits linear
kinetics. the active metabolite of loratadine,

only 1 to 2% of the dose) 57l

plasma concentrations (cmax) occurring i to 1.5
hours after ingestion. single doses of 40mg given
to healthy young volunteers produced cmax values
ranging from 24.3 to 30.5 f..l.g/l (table i). for both
loratadine 10 to 40mg and its major active metabolite, dcl, plasma concentrations exhibit a dose
proportional relationship.p'tl steady- state pharmacokinetics follow a similar pattern , with little accumulation ofloratadine occurring during multiple
once-daily admini stration of 40mg) 611 steadystate plasma drug concentrations were achieved by
the fifth day of therapy.l 611
dcl is rapidly formed, with c max occurring
within 1.5 to 3.7 hours following single dose oral
administration of loratadine 10 to 40mg or at
steady-state using dosages of 40 mg/day.l58, 611 the
rapid absorption of loratadine and the formation of
dcl correlates with the onset of antihistaminic action as assessed by wheal and flare, which occurs
within i to 2 hours post-dose.u''l
2.2 distribution

in healthy male volunteers, loratadine is 97 to
99% plasma protein bound , wherea s dcl is 73 to
76% bound) 601
in both single- (20 and 40mg) and multiple-dose
(40mg once daily) studies, biphasic disappearance
of the drug from plasma has been observed, with
distribution half-live s (t i;2(1) ranging from 0.9 to
1.0 and 2. i to 3.8 hours for loratadine and dcl,
respectively,l58,61,63j in addition , loratadine has a
large volume of distribution in healthy volunteers
(j 19 l/kg) which is indicative of extensive tissue
uptake and/or plasma protein binding.l 62l
following administration of a single oral dose
of loratadine 40mg to lactating women, both
loratadine and dcl equilibrated in breastmilk with
a plasma to milk ratio of '"1 : 1, thus suggesting
that both compounds are primarily excreted into
breastmilk by passive diffusion.l 60l cumulative
data indicate that after a single loratadine 40mg
dose, excretion of the drug into breastmilk occur s
within 8 hours. the extent of loratadine and dcl
excretion into breastmilk was minimal , amounting
to 0.029 % of the total administered dose over 48

administered dose would be ingested by a 4kg
breastfeeding infant on a mg/kg basis. little or no
difference in the disposition of loratadine was observed in lactating women when compared with
healthy male volunteers[58,61] (table i).
2.3 metabolism and excretion

the rapid apparent plasma clearance of loratadine following oral administration to healthy volunteers suggests extensive metabolism of the drug
(table i). the carbamate moiety of loratadine is
hydrolysed to form dcl, which is also rapidly metabolised by hydroxylation.i'vl animal studies indicate that loratadine is a phenobarbital-type inducer of liver microsomal cytochrome p450
enzymes.ivtl in vitro studies using human liver microsomal samples further suggest that although
© adis international limited. all rights reserved .

=

loratadine is preferentially metabolised by cyto chrome p450 cyp3a4, in the presence of cytochrome p450 cyp3a4 inhibitors such as ketoconazole it may also be metabolised by another
cytochrome p450 enzyme, cyp2d6.l65]
overall radioactivity, following single oral dose
administration of [14c]loratadine 40mg, was essentially cleared from the body in 2 days.l63] approximately 27% of the dose is eliminated in the
urine within the first 24 hours, while over a 10-day
period about 40% is excreted in the urine and 42%
in the faeces .l57] plasma elimination half-lives
(t t;2~) in single-dose studies of healthy volunteers
ranged from 7.8 to ii hours and from 17.3 to 24
hours for loratadine and dcl, respectively.l58] at
steady-state, 10 days after commencement of
loratadine 40 mg/day, similar respective tt;2~ values of 14.4 and 18.7 hours were noted.l 61]

loratadine: a review

2.4 effects of renal and liver disease

the disposition ofloratadine is not significantly
altered in patients with renal impairmentlv-j (table
i). despite large intersubject variability, parameters of drug absorption and clearance showed no
significant correlation with renal impairment.
while area under the plasma drug concentrationtime curve (aue) for dcl was doubled in patients
with renal impairment [creatinine clearance <1.8
lih (30 ml/min)] when compared with healthy volunteers, other significant differences in pharmacokinetic parameters were not apparent. haemodialysis appeared to have negligible effects on the
clearance of loratadine and dcl. thus , renal impairment is unlikely to necessitate dosage adjustment.
preliminary data from 7 adults with alcoholic
liver disease indicate that while tl/2~ values for
loratadine and dcl tended to be prolonged in these
individuals, they were generally within the range
observed for healthy individuals with normal hepatic function (data on file, schering-plough).
2.5 effect of age

in general, although a trend towards reduced
plasma clearance and prolonged t';2~ for loratadine
was noted in healthy elderly volunteers, significant
differences in these and other pharmacokinetic parameters were not apparent between the young and
elderly)s9] the pharmacokinetics of dcl were unaffected by age. thus, in view of large interindividual variations in pharmacokinetic parameters,
regardless of age, any observed differences between the 2 age groups are unlikely to be clinically
significant.
2.6 drug interactions

concurrent administration of terfenadine with
drugs such as ketoconazole, itraconazole, erythromycin and c1arithromycin that impair its metabolism to the non-cardiotoxic active carboxylate metabolite (via inhibition of the cytochrome p4s0
enzyme cyp3a4) appears to be an important risk
factor in the genesis of ecg disturbances during
© adis intemational limited. all rights reserved.

627

terfenadine therapy[49] (section 1.s). like terfenadine, loratadine is predominantly metabol ised
by cytochrome p4s0 cyp3a4; however, in the
presence of cyp3a4 inhibitors it can also be metabolised by cytochrome p4s0 cyp2d6[6s] (section 2.3), thus suggesting the existence of an alternative metabolic pathway for loratadine. recent
studies have therefore investigated whether similar
interactions to those that occur with terfenadine
also occur with loratadine. while these studies
show that ketoconazole, erythromycin and cimetidine are capable of inhibiting the metabolism of
loratadine to its active metabolite  xxxd1846xxx  (dcl), these pharmacokinetic interactions appear to be of little or no clinical signifi cance. where ecg parameters were measured,
adverse cardiovascular effects were not observed
as a result of elevated plasma concentrations of
loratadine or dcl.
inhibition of the in vitro metabolism of loratadine, terfenadine and astemi zole by ketoconazole
and itraconazole has been investigated in human
liver microsome preparations.l'vl of the 3 histamine h i-receptor antagonists studied, the metabolism of terfenadine to one of its metabolites
(hydroxyterfenadine) was most sensitive to inhibition by ketoconazole [icso value (concentration
producing so% inhibition) of o.s umol/l], whereas
the metabolism of  xxxd236xxx  to desmethylastemizole and loratadine to dcl were less sensitive to inhibition by this drug (icso values of 2.4
and is umol/l, respectively). itraconazole produced significant inhibition of terfenadine, but not
 xxxd236xxx , metabolism. no data were, however,
reported for the influence of itraconazole on
loratadine metabolism.
administration of an 8-day course of
ketoconazole 200mg twice daily to 12 healthy volunteers inhibited the metabolism of a single oral
dose of loratadine 20mg given on day s)67] significant 2- to 3-fold increases in loratadine c max (from
16 to 39 ilgll) and auco-8h (32 to 91 ilgll. h) values were observed, together with smaller increases
in dcl c max (9 to 12 ilg/l) and auco-8h (39 to 60
ug/l> h) values .

con current administration of loratadine iomg
once daily with cimetidine 300mg every 6 hours

and adverse effec ts were not observed; moreover,
sedation or syncope were not reported.

3. overview of clinical efficacy
th e clinical efficacy of loratadine has been
evaluated in patients with allergic rhinitis (seasonal and perennial), acute coryza (common cold)
and chronic idiopathic urticaria. more recentl y, the
potent ial use of lor atadine has been inve sti gated in
the treatment of patients with asthma. thi s section

in most studies, parameters were mea sured at baseline and on days 3, 7 and 14 of treatment. from the
available data , the numb er of patients exhibiting

l-week treatment course of loratadine lomg once
daily.!25,38]
in a total of 448 children aged 3 to 14 years,
short term therapy for 2 weeks with loratadine at
doses ranging from 2.5 to lomg once daily was as
effective as that with chlorpheniramine 2 to 4mg
twice daily,f78] dexchlorpheniramine i to 3mg
every 8 hours,!85]  xxxd236xxx  0.2 mg/kg once
daily!86] or terfenadine 15mg twice daily.!87] significant improvement in symptoms was also observed for patients treated with loratadine or comparator agents from day 3 of treatment in 3 of these
studies that were single-blind,!85-87]
mild cases of seasonal allergic rhinitis may be
controlled by oral histamine hi-receptor antagonists and systemic nasal decongestants; patients
with severe symptoms, however, may require
agents such as topical corticosteroids. recent data
indicate that loratadine lomg once daily was less
effective than intranasal fluticasone 20011g once
daily in improving symptoms of nasal blockage
and nasal peak inspiratory flow (but not eye irritation) in 240 adolescents (aged 12 to 17 years) with
moderate to severe seasonal allergic rhinitis,!88]
3.1.1 combination loratadinej
pseudoephedrine therapy

the newer histamine h i-receptor antagonists,
like their predecessors, are not particularly effective in relieving nasal blockage. thus, decongestants such as pseudoephedrine may be combined
with an histamine h i-receptor antagonist to improve efficacy. in a total of 1293 patients with seasonal allergic rhinitis, combination therapy with
loratadine 10mg and pseudoephedrine 240mg
taken as a single daily dose or in 2 divided doses
was superior to loratadine, pseudoephedrine and
placebo, in improving total symptom scores (nasal
and non-nasal) at the 14-day treatment endpoint,!89-91] when treatment was further extended
by 2 weeks, improvement in total symptoms remained greater with the combination than with placebo in 251 patients; monotherapy with loratadine
and pseudoephedrine was not assessed in this
study,!92]
© adis international limited. all rights reserved.

in general, the combination was superior to
pseudoephedrine monotherapy for relief of non. nasal symptoms and loratadine mono therapy for
nasal symptoms.f'" these results, however, were
not consistent. improvement in total symptom
scores , for example, in one study evaluating 435
patients with seasonal allergic rhinitis over 2
weeks, were significantly greater for the combination than for loratadine at day 4, but not at day
15)93] this effect was further confirmed by an
analysis of physician global evaluations, where a
difference between the combination and the 2 com ponents was apparent at day 4 only, but not at days
8 and 15.
3.2 perennial rhinitis

short term studies (3 to 4 weeks) in a total of
652 patients showed loratadine lomg once daily
to be superior to placebo and to be as effective as
terfenadine 60mg twice daily!94-97] or clemastine
1mg twice daily!98] in relieving the symptoms of
perennial rhinitis. long term therapy (6 months) in
this setting confirmed this finding , with both
loratadine iomg once daily and clemastine img
twice daily proving equally efficacious in 453 patients,!97,99] the number of reports of nasal stuffiness, post-nasal drainage and nasal discharge were
reduced by approximately 50% with loratadine
lomg once daily,!99] furthermore, loratadine was
noted to be superior to clemastine in relieving nasal
stuffiness after i week of trearment.p'u
similarly, in 31 children with perennial rhinitis,
both loratadine 2.5 to 5mg once daily and dex chlorpheniramine 0.5 to 1mg every 8 hours were
comparable in efficacy over a 4-week period. however, symptomatic improvement in ocular itching
was significantly greater with loratadine.l idol
3.3 acute coryza (common cold)

classical histamine h i-receptor antagonists
and histamine h r-receptor antagonist/decongestant combinations are widely used for the treatment
of the common cold. it is well recognised that
while these drugs do not prevent or shorten the
duration of this condition, they may provide sympdrugs 48 (4) 1994

631

loratadine: a review

tomatic relief. in 283 patients with symptoms of
acute coryza, the combination of loratadine 5mg
plus pseudoephedrine 120mg, in one tablet taken
twice daily produced some alleviation of symptoms such as rhinorrhoea, nasal patency, nasal
stuffiness, sneezing, nasal discharge and sore
throat in comparison with placebo during a 5-day
treatment period) 10i j it is uncertain from these results whether this combination provides a clinically important synergistic effect or whether single
components are equally beneficial. in particular,
available data do not confirm the clinical superiority of the combination over pseudoephedrine
alone.
3.4 urticaria and chronic allergic
skin disorders

chronic idiopathic urticaria is characterised by
the occurrence of episodic or persistent wheals
and/or angioedema, which may recur frequently
over months or years. severe itching can be especially problematic.uv-l while histamine hireceptor antagonists are the drugs of choice in the
symptomatic relief of this condition, response to
these agents is variable and may be incomplete,
with refractoriness often developing. i103]
clinical studies in chronic urticaria have shown
loratadine 10 mg/day to be superior to placebo over
treatment periods of 2 to 12 weeks in 367 patients,l103-105] and clinically comparable with
hydroxyzine 75 mg/day,1106] clemastine 2 mgt
d ayll07] and terfenadine 120 mg/d ayi97 , 108] in a
further 635 patients. symptomatic improvement
(in itching, erythema, number and size of hives)
was apparent at the end of the first week of therapy,
and tachyphylaxis was not demonstrated. furthermore, loratadine 10 mg/day showed a trend towards greater efficacy compared with terfenadine
120 mg/day in 120 patients, producing marked or
complete symptomatic relief in 64 vs 52% of patients, respectively, while exhibiting a lower treatment failure rate (13 vs 28%)) 102]
the role of histamine in the pathogenesis of
other skin disorders such as atopic dermatitis remains unclear. although unlikely to be an impor© adis international limited. all rights reserved.

tant mediator in inducing pruritus, a primary symptom of this condition, histamine may playa contributory part. preliminary data indicate that
loratadine may be a useful adjuvant in the management of moderate to severe atopic dermatitis.
within this patient population, some degree of improvement in pruritic symptoms was observed following treatment with loratadine 10 mg/day in 16
patients) 109] concomitant therapy with a mild topical corticosteroid was permitted during treatment
periods. in 192 children aged 6 to 12 years with
predominantly atopic dermatitis, 2 weeks of therapy with loratadine 5 to 10mg once daily or terfenadine 60mg twice daily produced respective improvements in itching scores of 54 and 58%.1110]
overall improvements in skin condition were also
comparable for both agents.
3.5 asthma

the use of first generation antihistamine agents
in asthma has been limited by their low potency as
competitive antagonists in the presence of high local concentrations of histamine in the airways,
insufficient drug concentrations at bronchial histamine hi-receptors, and their adverse anticholinergic and sedative effects) ill] while newer agents
provide a greater degree of histamine hi-receptor
antagonism within the airways, evidence to date
does not support their use as primary therapy in
asthmatic patients. only minor improvements in
pulmonary function or symptom scores have been
observed in patients with allergic asthma)37]
the clinical effectiveness of loratadine in allergic asthma remains unclear. in comparison with
placebo, adjunctive therapy with loratadine iomg
once daily for 8 weeks reduced the incidence of
symptoms (nocturnal asthma, wheezing, dyspnoea, coughing and sputum production), improved lung function [peak expiratory flow (pef)
and forced expiratory volume in i second (fev i)]
and reduced the need for inhaled salbutamol in 13
patients with moderate perennial asthma) 11ii
however, these differences were not statistically
significant. inhaled  xxxd294xxx

achieved with loratadine 20mg once daily was
comparable to that with ketotifen i mg twice daily
in 63 patients with mild seasonal asthma.l 112]
acute doses of loratadine administered to 31
children with mild allergic asthma produced a mild
degree of bronchodilation. mean changes in fev 1
of 8.4 and 15.5% were observed for loratadine
l omg and salbutamol 400llg, re spectively.ut -j
comparative data in 97 children with mild to moderate perennial asthma suggest that loratadine 10
to 20mg once daily is as effective as inhaled  xxxd1763xxx  l omg 4 times daily, although a
statistically significant improvement in symptoms
of wheezing and cough when compared with baseline was only apparent for those patients treated
with loratadine at the final week 8 evaluation.l-ul
4. overview of tolerability
loratadine is generally well tolerated at therapeutic doses in the majority of patients, including
the elderly and children. results from 15 noncomparative, short term studies involving approximately 55 000 patients treated for seasonal/
perennial rhinitis or allergic skin disorders with
loratadine l omg daily indicate that somnolence,
fatigue and headache are most common (",1%),
while dry mouth and gastrointestinal upset occur
less frequently ; these events were self limiting (reviewed by van cauwenbergel-pl). on longer term
therapy ($;6 months), loratadine was also well tolerated.[99]
at therapeutic doses, a lower incidence of sedation was noted with loratadine than with
azatadiue.u'[l cetirizine,[7s,77] clemastine,[79 ,80]
chlorphenirarninelfvl and  xxxd2572xxx .iuvl in
addition, loratadine was as well tolerated as placebo ; in particular, the incidence of dry mouth
indicative of anticholinergic effects wa s comparable to that observed with placebo (fig. 3) . in
clinical trials where routine laboratory tests were
performed, no clinically significant changes
were reported. [74,79,81,83]

tachyarrhythmias on overdosage or when given to
'at-risk' patients (e.g. those with pre-existing cardiovascular disease, hepatic dysfunction, or receiving other drugs that inhibit their metabolism) ,
serious ventricular arrhythmias have not been observed with loratadine to date , xxxd1068xxx ] although rare
cases of supraventricular tachycardia have been reported (data on file , schering-plough). recently,
the occurrence of prolonged qt c interval with
symptomatic ventricular tachycardia was described in a patient with a history of similar arrhythmias already receiving quinidine and who
was subsequently given loratadine 10 mg/day.li17]
however, it is doubtful whether this event can be
attributed to loratadine in view of concomitant
therapy with quinidine and the patient's pre-existing cardiac history.ls2,117]
the absence of serious cardiac events in the data
reported thus far suggest that loratadine has little
or no propensity to cause serious cardiotoxicity.
however, whether this conclusion can be extended
to imply safety for use in specific 'at risk ' patients

loratadine: a review

ing concurrent therapy with antiarrhythmic drugs
such as quinidine remains to be confirmed. in this
respect, it should be noted that serious cardiac
events associated with other histamine hi-receptor
antagonists have, in any case, been found to be very
rare . in one observational historical cohort analysis
of over 1.1 million 30-day drug expo sures, as few
as 1.6 excess life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias were observed per 10 000 drug exposures to
the 4 treatment cohorts, which included over-thecounter antihi stamines (mainly diphenhydramine),
terfenadine, clemastine and ibuprofen (comparator).l1181
4.1 tolerability of combination
loratadine/pseudoephedrine therapy

combination therapy with loratadine 5mg and
pseudoephedrine 120mg (as i tablet) taken twice
daily led to an increased incidence of adverse
events in comparison with loratadine or placebo,
but not pseudoephedrine monotherapy.p'u in particular, a significantly higher incidence of dry
mouth and insomnia were noted with combination
therapy than with loratadine or placebo. of the adverse events associated with pseudoephedrine,
only dry mouth occurred more frequently with the
combination. other effects such as nervousness,
dizziness and sedation were comparable for all 4
treatment groups.
4.2 overdosage with loratadine

overdose with loratadine 40 to 180mg resulted
in uneventful recovery in 5 case reports.l 115] in i
adult , loratadine 40mg was associated with tachycardia, headache and a feeling of discomfort. somnolence was observed in a 3-year-old child following accidental ingestion of 80mg, although no
neurological symptoms or sign s of toxicity were
observed in 3 other children aged 2 to 3 years who
ingested dose s of 80 to 180mg. furthermore, accidental overdosage in 5 young children produced no
prolongation of qt c interval or arrhythmias at
loratadine do sages 10 to 20 time s greater than
those recommended.l 52]

5. dosage and administration
at present , loratadine is indicated for the relief
of symptoms associated with allergic rhinitis, urticaria and other allergic dermatological conditions.
it is currently available as 2 formulation s, a 10mg
tablet and 5mg/5ml syrup. the recommended adult
dose of loratadine is 10mg once daily. children
aged 2 to 12 years weighing less than 30kg should
be prescribed 5mg once daily.
in adults, i combination tablet, containing
loratadine 5mg and pseudoephedrine 120mg, is
recommended twice daily for symptomatic relief
of acute coryza.
where possible, histamine h r-receptor antagonists should be given before an anticipated allergic
reaction . antihistaminic effects of these agents
continue for hour s after c max has been achieved,
and persist even when plasma concentrations have
declined to their lowest detectable limit s,!231
although dosage adjustments may be neces sary
in patients with hepatic impairment, this is unlikel y
to be required in either elderly patients or those
with renal impairment.

6. place of loratadine in therapy
histamine h r-receptor antagonists were introduced into clinical practice more than 40 years ago
and are extensively used for the symptomatic relief
of allergic conditions such as seasonal/perennial
rhinitis and urticaria. while older histamine h 1receptor antagonists cause significant sedative and
anticholinergic effects, second generation agents
are not hampered by these drawbacks .
the clinical efficacy of loratadine in allergic
rhinitis and urticaria has been confirmed in several
large, controlled, comparative trials in adult s and
in a limited number of children. at therapeutic
doses, loratadine was significantly more efficaciou s than placebo, faster acting than  xxxd236xxx 
and as effective as  xxxd255xxx , cetirizine, chlorpheniramine, clernastine,  xxxd2572xxx  and terfenadine. the addition of pseudoephedrine may provide
further relief of nasal symptoms in patients with
allergic rhinitis. attention has recently been didrug s 48 (4) 1994

verted towards the development of quality of life
questionnaires which may be used in conjunction
with traditional outcome measures of rhinoconjunctivitis within clinical trials .i! 19] the effect
of loratadine on quality of life in adolescents is
currently being evaluated.
in acute coryza, combination therapy with
loratadine plus pseudoephedrine may provide
some symptomatic relief in patients , but whether
this combination achieves a clinically superior response compared with pseudoephedrine monotherapy for acute coryza remains to be confirmed.
more recently, the efficacy of loratadine as adjunctive therapy in asthma has been investigated.
limited patient numbers and conflicting results do
not at present support its use as adjunctive therapy
in this condition.
loratadine appears to be well tolerated and is
less sedating than  xxxd255xxx , cetirizine, chlorpheniramine, clemastine or  xxxd2572xxx . serious ventricular arrhythmias similar to those described with
terfenadine and  xxxd236xxx  have not been observed
with loratadine to date, although rare cases of
supraventricular tachycardia have been reported .
in conclusion, recent studies confirm that
loratadine is an effective histamine h i-receptor antagonist in both adults and children. with its convenience of once daily administration, rapid onset
of action and essentially nonsedating properties, it
would appear to be an appropriate first-line agent
for patients with allergic rhinitis or urticaria.
