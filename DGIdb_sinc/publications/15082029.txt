abstract
the covalent attachment of  xxxd2982xxx  to  xxxd2106xxx  results in a new molecule  xxxd2860xxx , which has a significantly longer
half-life than  xxxd2106xxx . it is likely that the clearance of both  xxxd2106xxx  and  xxxd2860xxx  involves granulocyte colony simulating factor
(g-csf) receptor binding, but the pharmacokinetics of these drugs have not been compared in mice with and without a functional g-csf
receptor. we sought to clarify the role of receptor-mediated clearance of  xxxd2106xxx  and  xxxd2860xxx  using wild-type (wt) mice or mice with
a non-functional  xxxg529xxx  (knockout, ko). we administered single doses of  xxxd2106xxx  or  xxxd2860xxx  (10 or 100 ␮g kg−1 ) intravenously
to wt and ko mice. plasma levels of protein were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (elisa) at preset time points, and
auc, mrt, cl, vd , and t1/2 were calculated. when compared with wt mice, the  xxxg529xxx  ko mice had significantly greater auc,
longer mrt, longer t1/2 , and lower clearance. this was the case whether animals received 10 or 100 ␮g kg−1 and whether they received
 xxxd2106xxx  or  xxxd2860xxx . the volume of protein distribution was identical among wt and ko mice. however, the vd was larger after
 xxxd2860xxx  dosing than after  xxxd2106xxx  dosing. in both wt and ko mice, increasing the dose of figrastim or  xxxd2860xxx  resulted in
a proportional increase in the auc. a functional  xxxg529xxx  is an important mechanism in the plasma clearance of both  xxxd2106xxx  and
 xxxd2860xxx .

for its role in regulating granulocytopoiesis [1]. recombinant dna technology and gene cloning has allowed the
development of many types of recombinant human g-csf

used form of rhg-csf in the usa, is non-glycosylated.
it has a short half-life (2–4 h) resulting from a combination of renal and neutrophil receptor-mediated clearance
(rmc) [4–6]. covalent attachment of a 20-kda molecule
(monomethoxy  xxxd2982xxx ) to the n-terminal methionyl residue of  xxxd2106xxx  leads to the formation of  xxxd2860xxx . the pharmacodynamic properties of  xxxd2860xxx  are similar to those of  xxxd2106xxx , but  xxxd2860xxx  has
a longer half-life [7–12]. the effects of  xxxd2860xxx  on absolute neutrophil count and cd34+ moblilization are comparable or greater than those achieved with daily  xxxd2106xxx 
[10]. the advantages of a sustained duration preparation include less frequent administration, similar mean duration of
neutropenia and time to absolute neutrophil recovery in patients with non-hodgkin’s lymphoma or hodgkins’ disease
[7], significantly lower mean duration of neutropenia in patients with breast cancer who have received chemotherapy

[7], and a reduced incidence of febrile neutropenia [7]. overall, this results in fewer injections, improved patient compliance, and reduced costs associated with administration.
it is not known what role the  xxxg529xxx  ( xxxg529xxx )
plays in the clearance of  xxxd2860xxx . in humans, monkeys,
mice, and rats, g-csf is eliminated through two pathways:
(1) a saturable clearance process, which is mediated by the
 xxxg529xxx , and (2) an unsaturable process primarily mediated
through renal clearance [8,13]. it is thought the pegylation
of the molecule results in a reduced renal clearance rate,
thus the removal of the drug becomes dependent primarily
on the number of neutrophils in circulation [8,12,14].
to clarify the role of the  xxxg529xxx  in the clearance
of  xxxd2106xxx  and  xxxd2860xxx , we performed the present
study using mice with a targeted deletion in the  xxxg529xxx 
[15]. the murine  xxxg529xxx  gene consists of 17 exons, and
 xxxg529xxx  knockout (ko) mice lack exons 3–8. this yields
a non-functional  xxxg529xxx  protein, since the translational
initiation site, signal peptide, and g-csf binding domains
of the protein are removed. mice with a defective  xxxg529xxx 
develop normally have normal reproductive capability, and
are grossly indistinguishable from their wild-type (wt)
counterparts; however, they have lower blood neutrophil
concentrations and are more susceptible to death from bacterial infection. specifically, in this study we compared the
plasma pharmacokinetics of  xxxd2860xxx  to  xxxd2106xxx  using two different doses (10 and 100 ␮g kg−1 ) in wt and
 xxxg529xxx  ko mice.

or  xxxd2860xxx  by tail vein injection. the animals were
anesthetized with isoflurane (abbott laboratories, north
chicago, il, usa) and terminally bled by cardiac puncture
after the administration of each form of protein according to
the following schedules: wt mice ( xxxd2106xxx ) were drawn
at 5, 15, 30 min, 1, 3, 6, 9 and 12 h; wt mice ( xxxd2860xxx ) had additional draws at 12, 24, 48 and 72 h; ko mice
( xxxd2106xxx ) same as wt mice with additional draws at 24
and 36 h; ko mice ( xxxd2860xxx ) same as wt  xxxd2860xxx  with additional draws at 96, 120, and 144 h. a minimum
of three mice was used for each data point.

2. materials and methods

2.5. pharmacokinetic analysis

2.1. animals

a non-compartmental model was used to obtain the area
under the curve (auc), mean residence time (mrt), systemic clearance (cl), plasma half-life (t1/2 ), and volume of
distribution (vd ). estimates of auc and area under the first
moment curve (aumc) from 0 to time t, were determined
using the linear trapezoidal method. the apparent terminal
elimination rate constant, ke , was obtained by linear regression analysis. auc and aumc were extrapolated to infinity
by adding the term clast /ke or (clast ×tlast )/ke +clast /ke2 , respectively. from these data, mrt (aumc0→∞ /auc0→∞ )
and cl (dose/auc0→∞ ) were calculated. the statistical significance of differences between the groups was tested by
student’s t-test, kruskal–wallis test and the post-hoc analysis of ‘least significant difference of rank’ methods. differences of p < 0.05 were considered significant. statistics
were calculated using spss 9.0 for windows (chicago, il,
usa).

wt and ko mice (c57bl/6 × 129svj) were housed three
or four per cage under environmentally controlled conditions
(specific pathogen free, spf) with free access to standard
rodent chow and water ad libitum at the vivarium of the
university of south florida, st. petersburg, fl, usa. fourto eight-week-old male and female mice were used for this
study. the university of south florida institutional animal
care and use committee (iacuc) approved the study.
2.2. growth factors
recombinant growth factors were supplied by amgen inc.
(thousand oaks, ca, usa) in vials of 0.3 mg ml−1 for  xxxd2106xxx  and 10 ␮g ml−1 for  xxxd2860xxx . the drugs were
diluted with their respective solvents to obtain a final concentration of 5 and 50 ␮g ml−1 , respectively, and then stored
at 2–8 ◦ c.

2.4. elisa determinations
plasma samples were collected, aliquoted, and stored at
−80 ◦ c until analysis. protein concentrations were quantified by an elisa (quantikine human g-csf immunoassay; r&d systems, minneapolis, mn) with a lower limit of
sensitivity of 7 pg ml−1 . samples with concentrations that
exceeded the linear limit of the assay were diluted so that
the measured concentration would be within the upper limits
of the assay. the assay has no measurable cross-reactivity
with other cytokines and recognizes both natural g-csf
and rhg-csf. it does not recognize murine g-csf unless
concentrations are above 50,000 pg ml−1 . the coefficient
of variation for the inter-assay precision of this elisa is
3.2–4.1%. the measurement of  xxxd2860xxx  was validated
using this elisa and found to have an inter-assay coefficient of variation of 2.3–3.4%.

the baseline protein concentrations (data not shown) of wt
and ko mice. the auc and mrt after administration of
 xxxd2860xxx  were significantly greater than those after administration of the same dose of  xxxd2106xxx  (p < 0.01). the
clearance of  xxxd2860xxx  was three-fold less than that of
 xxxd2106xxx , resulting in a significantly longer plasma half-life
for  xxxd2860xxx  (p < 0.01). ko mice had a significantly
longer t1/2 , and a lower clearance, than did wt mice, for
both  xxxd2106xxx  and  xxxd2860xxx  (p < 0.01). the clearance
decreased with administration of the higher dose of both
drugs (p = 0.01), but this was not seen among the ko mice.
after receiving 10 ␮g kg−1 of  xxxd2106xxx , plasma g-csf
concentrations returned to the pre-dose range by 12 h. this

after receiving 100 ␮g kg−1 of  xxxd2106xxx , plasma g-csf
concentrations returned to the pre-dose range by 24 h. this
did not differ between the wt and ko mice (p = 0.31).
after receiving 10 ug kg−1 of  xxxd2860xxx , plasma
g-csf concentrations returned to pre-dose range by 48 h in
wt mice, but remained elevated in the ko mice for 144 h
(p = 0.04). after receiving 100 ␮g kg−1 of  xxxd2860xxx ,
plasma g-csf concentrations in ko mice exceeded those
in wt mice (p = 0.02) and after 144 h they remained
10-fold higher than baseline levels (p = 0.02).

4. discussion
we compared single-dose pharmacokinetics of  xxxd2106xxx  and  xxxd2860xxx  in mice with and without a functional  xxxg529xxx . we observed that mice lacking a functional
 xxxg529xxx  had a lower clearance and a significantly longer
t1/2 than did wt mice for both  xxxd2106xxx  and  xxxd2860xxx .
among wt mice, giving a higher dose resulted in a drop
in clearance for both  xxxd2106xxx  and  xxxd2860xxx . however,
among ko mice, giving the higher dose did not cause a drop

in the already very low clearance. this pattern of clearance
is consistent with a receptor-mediated mechanism that is saturable and supports the role of the  xxxg529xxx  as a relevant
mechanism for  xxxd2106xxx  and  xxxd2860xxx  clearance.
determination of wbc counts before and after dosing
with g-csf or  xxxd2860xxx  were not part of this study. we
specifically chose not to perform pharmcodynamic analyses since it was previously reported that the wbc of these
same ko mice do not change significantly over baseline
even when a much larger (250 ␮g kg−1 per day) dose was
administered for five consecutive days [15].
previous studies indicate that the pharmacokinetics of
g-csf are affected by the dose given, the degree of glycosylation of the product, renal function, and number of white
blood cell receptors [16]. tanaka and kaneko investigated
the pharmacokinetics of rhg-csf among male c3h mice
after a single intravenous dose of 100 ␮g kg−1 [17]. extrapolating values from data provided in their manuscript, serum
g-csf concentrations 40 min after dosing were approximately 625 ng ml−1 , a value approximately 10-fold lower
than that we observed for plasma concentrations. similarly,
6 h after dosing they observed g-csf concentrations of
90 ng ml−1 , nearly five-fold less than ours. differences in
the strain of mice, the age of the mice (9–11 weeks versus
our 4–8 weeks), the type of rhg-csf, and the assays used to
measure g-csf could each contribute to these differences.
however, the t1/2 in the tanaka and kaneko study (2.0 h)
was very similar to the t1/2 observed in this experiment
(1.7 ± 0.1 h).
in another report, kuwabara and colleagues examined
the pharmacokinetics of rhg-csf in 6–8-week-old balb/c
mice after administering 50 ␮g kg−1 iv or subcutaneously
[18]. g-csf plasma concentrations were measured using an
elisa. one hour after dosing, concentrations were 191 ±
14 ng ml−1 , compared with approximately 2000 ng ml−1 at
the same time point in our study in which a larger dose

58

a.c. kotto-kome et al. / pharmacological research 50 (2004) 55–58

(100 ␮g kg−1 ) was used. however, the t1/2 in their study
was 1.69 h, very similar to the data presented in this report
and that of the tanaka and kaneko study. differences in
strain of mice, source of rhg-csf, and the time of day of
injection [19] could contribute to the differences in g-csf
concentrations.
the administration of g-csf to patients in the clinical
setting is likely to have variable clearance depending upon
the dose administered, the neutrophil count, and the renal
function of the patient at the time of dosing [8,13]. median
plasma half-lives of pegylated g-csf are independent of
the dose [20]. although pegylated g-csf has reduced renal
clearance, impaired renal function could result in a longer
duration effect than predicted. these issues should be taken
into account when attempts are made to extrapolate data
from animal studies to human studies.
in this study, we chose to evaluate and compare the effects of intravenously administered g-csf and pegylated
g-csf. however, in clinical practice the subcutaneous route
is used most frequently in adults, children and neonates. differences in the pharmacokinetics of intravenously administered and subcutaneously administered g-csf have been
noted. azuma et al. [21] and houston et al. [22] reported
that the average clearance after intravenous administration
is lower than after subcutaneous administration. in addition, the subcutaneous administration of g-csf results in
a higher neutrophil count and a longer stimulated duration
when compared to the same dose of intravenously administered g-csf. therefore, following subcutaneous administration, the absolute bioavailability, when calculated from
the auc ratio (aucsc /auciv ), is expected to be an underestimate and will not indicate the true amount absorbed [13].
the results of this study indicate that a functional
 xxxg529xxx  is involved in the clearance of both  xxxd2106xxx  and
 xxxd2860xxx . however, other mechanisms for clearance,
besides  xxxg529xxx  binding, must also be relevant, because
our ko mice had declining g-csf concentrations over time.
