in the polyamine back-conversion pathway,  xxxd3234xxx  and
spermidine are first acetylated by spermidine\ xxxd3234xxx  n"acetyltransferase (ssat) and then oxidized by polyamine oxidase
(pao) to produce spermidine and putrescine respectively.
although pao was first purified more than two decades ago, the
protein has not yet been linked to genomic sequences. in the
present study, we apply a blast search strategy to identify
novel oxidase sequences located on human chromosome 10 and
mouse chromosome 7. homologous mammalian cdnas derived
from human brain and mouse mammary tumour were deduced
to encode proteins of approx. 55 kda having 82 % sequence
identity. when either cdna was transiently transfected into
hek-293 cells, intracellular  xxxd3234xxx  pools decreased by approx.
30 %, whereas spermidine increased 2–4-fold. lysates of human
pao cdna-transfected hek-293 cells, but not vector-transfected cells, rapidly oxidized n"-acetylspermine to spermidine. substrate specificity determinations with the lysate assay revealed a
preference ranking of n"-acetylspermine l n"-acetylspermidine
 n",n"#-diacetylspermine   xxxd3234xxx  ; spermidine was not
acted upon. this ranking is identical to that reported for purified

introduction
in the polyamine biosynthetic pathway, polyamines are
assembled by the sequential transferral of aminopropyl units
derived from decarboxylated  xxxd3156xxx  on to a core
diamine unit (putrescine, put) derived from ornithine via the
 xxxg1626xxx  (odc) reaction. in the polyamine backconversion pathway, these same aminopropyl units are systematically removed via two sequential enzyme reactions.
 xxxd3234xxx  (spm) is first acetylated by spermidine\ xxxd3234xxx  n"acetyltransferase (ssat) and then oxidized by polyamine oxidase
(pao) to yield stoichometric amounts of spermidine (spd), 3acetamidopropanal and  xxxd2298xxx  [1,2]. the conversion
of spd to put takes place by analogous reactions involving the
same two enzymes. unlike the four major biosynthetic enzymes
and ssat, pao has not yet been cloned due to difficulties in
purifying the protein on the basis of enzyme activity and the lack
of a specific antibody. the availability of human genomic
databases, however, provides new opportunities to relate unique
genomic sequences to specific enzyme activities.
we recently used a functional genomics approach to identify
sequences belonging to a previously unrecognized  xxxd3234xxx -

pao and distinctly different from the recently identified  xxxd3234xxx 
oxidase (smo), which prefers  xxxd3234xxx  over n"-acetylspermine.
monoethyl- and diethylspermine analogues also served as
substrates for pao, and were internally cleaved adjacent to a
secondary amine. we deduce that the present oxidase sequences
are those of the fad-dependent pao involved in the polyamine
back-conversion pathway. in northern blot analysis, pao
mrna was much less abundant in hek-293 cells than smo or
ssat mrna, and all three were differentially induced in a
similar manner by selected polyamine analogues. the identification of pao sequences, together with the recently identified
smo sequences, provides new opportunities for understanding
the dynamics of polyamine homoeostasis and for interpreting
metabolic and cellular responses to clinically-relevant polyamine
analogues and inhibitors.

directed oxidase [3]. a blast search of genomic data using
maize pao sequences [4] revealed what at first appeared to be
the homologous mammalian enzyme [5]. subsequent characterization of the substrate specificity revealed that the enzyme
was actually a novel mammalian fad-dependent  xxxd3234xxx 
oxidase (smo). our success in this regard relied on the use of a
defining assay system [6] whereby hek-293 cells were transfected
with the candidate cdna, ruptured, and the lysate incubated for
short periods in the presence of candidate polyamine substrates.
hplc analysis of lysate polyamine levels before and after
incubation with each substrate revealed the effects of the transfected sequences on both candidate polyamine substrates and
predicted polyamine products. thus oxidase activity was simultaneously validated by direct measurement of substrate loss
and product gain, endpoints that are much more defining than
measuring liberation of  xxxd2298xxx  [5]. in applying this
assay to the newly identified smo sequences, we observed that
the enzyme greatly preferred spm over n"-acetylspermine
(acspm). since pao has been repeatedly reported to prefer
acetylated polyamines over spm [7–9], we deduced that the new
oxidase was actually a previously unidentified mammalian smo
involved in the direct conversion of spm to spd [3].

s. vujcic and others

in the present report, we return our attention to the
characterization of the pao involved in acetylated polyamine
oxidation. pao is a fad-containing amine oxidase found in all
vertebrate tissues [10] and it has been shown to be subcellularly
located in both the cytoplasm and peroxisomes [11–13]. it was
first purified from rat and porcine liver by chromatographic
methods in 1977 [11]. as noted above, it is thought to favour
acetylated polyamines over non-acetylated species and has
therefore been paired with the acetylating enzyme ssat in the
back-conversion pathway [9]. the significance of the enzyme
response to changes in cell growth, or its role as a determinant of
drug action for polyamine-directed compounds, has not yet been
established. it is thought to be constitutively expressed in most
tissues because of its high activity and extremely slow turnover
rate [14]. thus the more labile and inducible ssat enzyme,
rather than pao, is considered rate-limiting to polyamine backconversion. while changes in pao activity are not typically
associated with induction of cell growth, activity has been
reported to be lower in human colon carcinoma [15], breast
carcinoma [16] and other tumours [17], relative to normal tissue.
consistent with the latter, takenoshita et al. [18] have reported
that levels of the preferred pao substrate, n"-acetylspermidine
(acspd), are much higher in colon adenocarcinoma than in
benign polyps or normal surrounding muscosa, suggesting that
pao activity may decrease during tumorigenesis. other studies
have also suggested that  xxxd2298xxx  liberated during
oxidation of intracellular polyamines may mediate aspects of
embryonic development [19] and apoptotic responses to polyamine analogues [20,21]. pao may also play a protective role
in myc-driven apoptosis of transformed human haematopoietic
cells [22].
herein, we apply a functional genomics approach to identify
murine and human sequences belonging to the pao involved in
the polyamine back-conversion pathway. the specificity of the
enzyme for acspm and acspd over spm or spd is identical to
the activity previously described with semi-purified enzyme
preparations, and is clearly different from that of smo. in
addition, we demonstrate that, like smo, pao expression is
unexpectedly inducible by polyamine analogues and thus may
contribute to the inhibition of cell growth. with this discovery,
all of the major polyamine metabolic enzymes have been cloned,
with the exception of spermidine n)-acetyltransferase [23]. it
should now be possible to gain a more complete understanding
of polyamine metabolism and its role in normal and neoplastic
cell growth, as well as a better appreciation of the specific
metabolic roles of smo and pao.

experimental
materials
the inhibitor of pao, mdl-72,527 [24,25], was kindly
provided by aventis (bridgewater, nj, u.s.a.). n",n"#-diacetylspermine (daspm) and the calmodulin antagonist [26] n"(n-octanesulphonyl) xxxd3234xxx  (n"osspm) were a gift from dr
nikolaus seiler (laboratory of nutritional oncology, strasbourg, france) and various ethylated  xxxd3234xxx  analogues were
from dr raymond bergeron (university of florida, gainesville,
fl, u.s.a.). spm, spd, put, acspm and acspd were originally
purchased from sigma (st. louis, mo, u.s.a.), although the
latter two compounds are no longer available from that source.

homology search and cdna acquisition
a blast sequence homology search [27] of genome and cdna
databases was carried out using human smo sequences [2,3]
# 2003 biochemical society

followed by a pfam homology search [28] for fad-binding
domains [29]. clones containing candidate human cdna (image, 4932036 ; genbank2 accession no. bc032778 from human
brain tissue) and mouse oxidase cdna sequences (image,
5059720 ; genbank2 accession no. b1526976 from mouse mammary tissue) were obtained from a.t.t.c. (rockville, md,
u.s.a.).

plasmids
cdnas were cloned into a sal1\not1 site in a pcmv-sport 6
vector (invitrogen, carlsbad, ca, u.s.a.). all plasmid dnas
were prepared using an endofree maxi-prep kit (qiagen,
valencia, ca, u.s.a.) following the manufacturer’s protocol.
the amount of dna was measured spectrophotometrically
(bio-rad laboratories, hercules, ca, u.s.a.).

cells and transfections
transformed human kidney hek-293 cells were cultured in
dulbecco’s modified eagle’s medium (life technologies,
gaithersburg, md, u.s.a.) supplemented with 2 mm glutamine,
10 % fetal bovine serum, 100 units\ml penicillin and 100 µg\ml
streptomycin at 37 mc in the presence of 5 % co . cells were
#
harvested by trypsinization and counted electronically (coulter
model zm, coulter electronics, hialeah, fl, u.s.a.). cells
were transfected with human or mouse pao or smo cdna in
the presence of fugene 6 (roche molecular biochemicals,
indianapolis, in, u.s.a.) following the manufacturer’s protocol.
following transfection (48 h), cells were trypsinized, washed
with pbs and stored at k70 mc for polyamine pool analysis, or
used in the lysate activity assay described below. control cells
were transfected with an empty vector and used to detect
endogenous oxidase activities.

pao activity assay
the lysate assay for defining enzyme activity and substrate
specificity was used as described recently [3]. briefly, transiently
cdna- or vector-transfected cells were sonicated in 10 mm tris
buffer (ph 8.0). aliquots were stored at k70 mc and used as the
enzyme source in the oxidase activity assay [6]. transfected cell
lysate samples were added to a reaction buffer containing 200 mm
glycine (ph 9.5), 1 mm dithiothreitol and 200 µm of a candidate
polyamine substrate (i.e. put, spd, spm, acspd, acspm or
daspm). the reaction buffer also contained 500 µm  xxxd2951xxx  as an inhibitor of endogenous  xxxg167xxx  activity
and 50 µm  xxxd2850xxx  as an inhibitor of endogenous monoamine
oxidase activity [6]. the assay was carried out as follows. a
lysate-containing sample was inactivated with 0.6 m perchloric
acid immediately following addition of a polyamine substrate ;
this served as the ‘ blank ’ lysate sample. in contrast, the assay
lysate sample was incubated for 0–60 min in the presence of
substrate before being inactivated with perchloric acid. polyamine determinations by hplc were made on all samples and
expressed in nmoles\mg of protein. pao activity was evaluated
by comparing polyamine levels in the blank sample versus the
assay sample. if a polyamine serves as a pao substrate (i.e.
acspm), its concentration decreased during the incubation while
the concentration of an oxidase reaction product (i.e. spd)
increased. a comparison of enzyme-transfected versus vectortransfected lysates indicates whether observed polyamine effects
are attributable to endogenous versus introduced enzyme activity.

identification of fad-dependent polyamine oxidase
hplc
polyamine levels were extracted from transfected cells or from
blank or assay lysate samples by treatment with 0.6 m perchloric
acid followed by a 15 min centrifugation at 4 mc. extracts were
then dansylated and assayed by reverse-phase hplc as described
previously [30]. the data was collected and analysed using the
millennium 32 chromatography software (version 3.05, waters
corp, milford, ma, u.s.a.). peaks were identified and
quantitated by alignment with a chromatogram of known
standards including put, spd, spm, acspd, acspm, daspm and
n",(-diaminoheptane as an internal standard.

polyamine enzyme assays
odc,  xxxd3156xxx  decarboxylase ( xxxg152xxx ) and
ssat activities in transiently transfected 293 cells were assayed
as described previously [31].

northern blot analysis
total rna was isolated using rneasy minikit (qiagen, valencia,
ca, u.s.a.) and northern blot analysis of pao, smo and
ssat mrna from untreated and analogue-treated hek-293
cells was conducted as reported previously [30].

diginorthern analysis of pao versus smo expressed sequence
tag (est) expression
a virtual analysis of the relative gene expression levels in different
tissues for smo and pao genes was performed using our inhouse bioinformatics tool, diginorthern [32]. the method analyses indexed est data and applies a dynamic approach to collect
the most recently updated est data. it also allows for a side-byside comparison of two genes, such as pao and smo. since pao
is a new gene, the virtual northern data is not available from the
national cancer institute’s cancer genome anatomy project
site (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\ncicgap\) and could only be
obtained through diginorthern.

results
a blast search of public genome and cdna databases using
human smo sequences [3] and the fad-binding domain [29]
yielded new putative oxidase sequences which, on the basis
of substrate specificity data described below, we have designated pao. thus the human pao gene (ncbi accession no.
xmi113592) is located on chromosome 10 and the mouse gene
(ncbi accession no. xmi133921) on chromosome 7. the
human pao cdna (1850 bp) encodes a protein (ncbi accession
no. xpi113592) comprising 511 amino acids and a deduced
molecular mass of 55.5 kda, whereas the mouse cdna (1749 bp)
encodes a protein (ncbi accession no. xpi133921) comprising
504 amino acids and a deduced molecular mass of approx.
55 kda. a sequence comparison indicated 39 % identity between
human and smo and pao proteins. as shown in figure 1,
conservation between pao and smo spans almost the entire two
proteins. a major noticeable difference is that pao lacks a 31amino-acid fragment in the middle of the protein. the human
and mouse pao share 81 % sequence identity compared with
the 95 % identity between human and mouse smo proteins,
suggesting that pao gene is less conserved than smo. mouse
pao has a slightly shorter n-terminus than human pao.
although human and mouse pao have the same general gene
structure, pao differs distinctly from smo. there are, however,
three identical exon\intron borders between the two proteins,

21

suggesting that they share common distant ancestral origins. in
addition, orthologous genes for pao and smo have been
identified in fugu fish by searching the draft genome (results not
shown). thus it seems that the divergence of these two paralogous
genes occurred at, or before, the evolution of all vertebrates.
the newly identified human and mouse pao cdna-containing vectors were transiently transfected with high efficiency
into hek-293 human kidney cells. in order to gain insight into
the nature of the oxidase activity, we first examined enzyme
effects on intracellular polyamine pools (table 1). spm pools
decreased by approx. 30 %, whereas spd pools increased
by approx. 2-fold in cells transfected with human pao and by
approx. 4-fold in cells transfected with mouse pao. put pools
increased by varying amounts, depending on whether human or
mouse cdna was involved. the effects of the transfected pao
on acetylated polyamines could not be easily assessed in hek293 cells, since neither acspm or acspd are detectable under
basal conditions. as shown in table 1, the effects of transfected
smo on intracellular spm and spd pools were more dramatic
than with transfected pao, a finding that is consistent with
previous findings, and with the greater substrate preference of
smo for spm [3]. in contrast with smo [3], pao failed to
increase odc activity, ssat activity or acspd pools (table 1),
most probably because it had much less of an effect on the
polyamine pools that regulate these enzymes.
we next examined the relative preference of pao and smo
for spm versus acspm in the cell lysate assay. for these studies,
hek-293 cells were transfected with human pao, human smo
or empty vector, lysed, and aliquots of the lysate were incubated
in the presence of candidate polyamine substrates. hplc chromatograms of lysate polyamine levels were compared for each
substrate before and following the 30 min incubation. oxidase
activity was assessed on the basis of substrate decline (i.e. acspm
or spm) relative to product gain (i.e. spd). as shown in table 2,
the substrate acspm decreased by 83 % (a difference of approx.
13 100 nmol\mg of protein) during the 30 min incubation with
pao-transfected lysates, whereas the spd product increased by
an equivalent amount (approx. 12 400 nmol\mg of protein).
by comparison, the alternative substrate, spm, was reduced by
only 13 % in the same lysate assay, giving rise to a similar amount
of spd. the preference of the new oxidase for acspm over spm is
consistent with the expected substrate specificity of pao [11–13],
and opposite to that of smo [3]. as shown in table 2, the
substrate spm was reduced by 92 % during incubations with
smo-transfected cell lysates, whereas the substrate acspm was
reduced by only 9 %. the two enzymes were almost totally
inhibited by the mechanism-based pao inhibitor, mdl-72,527
[24,25], when it was added 10 min prior to the addition of the
preferred substrate (i.e. acspm for pao and spm for smo).
however, when mdl-72,527 was added at the same time as the
substrate, pao activity was inhibited by 67 % (i.e. 83 % minus
16 %) while smo activity was reduced by 53 % (i.e. 92 %
minus 39 %), indicating slightly greater sensitivity of the former
enzyme. the possible contribution of endogenous enzymes was
examined using empty-vector-transfected cell lysates in the
presence of acspm or spm and found to be of no consequence
during the 30 min incubation.
the substrate specificity of pao was more obviously defined
by a kinetic comparison of substrate loss versus product gain
during a 60 min incubation. as shown in figure 2, acspm and
acspd were oxidized at rates similar to those of spd and put
respectively. in both cases, the reaction had proceeded to
completion by 30 min. there was no suggestion that the newly
generated product, spd, was acted upon by the enzyme, as
indicated by the absence of put generation during the acspm

oxidase is acspm l acspd  daspm  spm ; spd was not
acted upon at all. this high concordance with previously
published findings based on semi-purified enzyme preparations
[11–13] was taken as evidence that the oxidase is actually pao.
mouse pao was found to have the same substrate specificity as
human pao (results not shown).
since there have been reports that pao is capable of ndealkylating certain polyamine analogues [33–35], we compared
the substrate potential of four ethylated  xxxd3234xxx  analogues
(table 3). the assay was identical to that described above, except
that 200 µm analogue was substituted for spm during the 30 min
incubation. substrate activity was assessed by analogue decline
and by analogue product accumulation. n"-monoethylspermine
(mespm) was actively oxidized by pao to yield spd. thus
instead of the expected n-dealkylation reaction [32–34], nethylated 5-aminopropanal was removed from the analogue.
three diethyl analogues were also tested. the first, n",n""diethylnorspermine (denspm), is a diethyl derivative of norspm
in which the intra xxxd2850xxx  distances are all composed of three
carbon bridges. the second, n",n"#-diethylspermine (despm),
is a diethyl derivative of spm in which the intra xxxd2850xxx  distances

are composed of three, four and three carbon bridges. the third,
n",n"%-diethylhomospermine (dehspm) is a diethyl derivative
of homospermine in which the intra xxxd2850xxx  distances are all four
carbon bridges. all three of these compounds were previously
found to be competitive inhibitors [3] and poor substrates
(s. vujcic, p. diegelman and c. w. porter, unpublished
work) of the smo reaction. when incubated in the pao lysate
assay, these analogues appeared to undergo internal intra xxxd2850xxx 
cleavage by the enzyme. in the case of despm, a n"monoethylspermidine (mespd) standard was used to chromatographically identify the product of the reaction. in the case
of denspm and dehspm, the reaction products were determined by retention times relative to the mespd standard.
thus despm analogues were oxidized to mespd analogues (i.e.
denspm was oxidized to n"-monoethylnorspermine, despm
to mespd and dehspm to dehspd). there was no chromatographic evidence to suggest n-dealkylation of the terminal ethyl
group (i.e. despm analogues were not converted to a mespm
analogues). none of the newly formed spd analogues appeared
to be oxidized further, as indicated by the absence of new
products, such as put or put analogues. the diethyl analogues

decline as rapidly as the products spd and put accumulate and that, by comparison, the substrate spm decreases and the product spd increases very slowly. when daspm is used as a substrate,
acspd is first liberated as a product and then oxidized further to put.

were differentially acted upon by the enzyme in a manner that
correlated with the number of aminopropyl moieties contained
within the molecule. thus the rank order of substrate preference by pao was mespm  denspm  despm  dehspm.
consistent with previous reports [26,34], the calmodulin
antagonist n"osspm was also found to be internally oxidized to
form spd. this also contrasts our finding with smo, in which
n"osspm was previously found to be a potent inhibitor [3].
we next examined whether pao was endogenously expressed
in hek-293 cells and whether, like smo and ssat, pao
expression is inducible by polyamine analogues. as shown by
northern blot analysis (figure 3), pao mrna is basally
expressed at
5 % of ssat mrna and
25 % of smo
mrna. treatment with 10 µm denspm for 48 h resulted in a
2.0-fold induction in pao mrna and an 4.6-fold induction in
# 2003 biochemical society

ssat mrna, compared with a 3.4-fold induction of smo
mrna. the differential mrna response to the three analogues
clearly demonstrates that all three enzymes are preferentially
induced in correlation with the aminopropyl moieties contained
within each analogue, i.e. denspm (which contains 3 aminopropyl moieties) was the most effective, despm (which contains
two) was intermediately effective and dehspm (which contains none) was the least effective.
finally, we compared the expression of pao and smo in
various tissues and tumour counterparts by virtual northern
analysis using publicly available est databases. among the
tissues represented, there were a total of 112 smo ests and 60
pao ests. as shown in the virtual northern blot analysis
depicted in figure 4, the two genes showed distinctly different
expression profiles from one another, and interesting tumour

figure 3 northern blot analysis of pao, smo and ssat mrna expression
and induction in analogue-treated hek-293 cells
cells were treated in the presence or absence (con) of 10 µm polyamine analogue denspm
(den), despm (des), or dehspm (deh) for 24 or 48 h before being harvested for mrna
extraction. gels were loaded with 30 µg of total rna and radiographically exposed for 72 h.
for quantitation, ssat, smo and pao mrna bands were scanned densitometrically, normalized
to  xxxg861xxx  and expressed as fold-increase of treated versus
control (values located below respective bands). note that smo mrna was higher than pao
mrna and that the rank order of analogue induction was denspm  despm  dehspm.

versus normal comparisons emerged in certain cases. of the six
tissues for which est comparisons between normal and neoplasia
are available, three (kidney, ovary and prostate) showed reduced
levels of pao in neoplastic tissues. of particular interest, pao
expression is significantly lower in neoplastic versus normal
prostate, whereas smo expression is markedly higher in this
same comparison.

discussion
as a tool, functional genomics is only as meaningful as the
specificity of the assay used for assigning functional activity to
genomic sequences. a distinct advantage of the enzyme assay
used for assigning smo and pao function is that it simultaneously measures substrate loss and product gain, and

thereby yields direct indication of the nature of the oxidation
reaction being measured. several lines of evidence obtained from
this assay indicate that the oxidase sequences identified by
blast search using smo sequences belong to the pao involved
in the polyamine back-conversion pathway. first, the lysate
assay revealed that, in accordance with earlier studies with pao
[7,8], the present enzyme oxidized acspm to spd and acspd to
put. in addition, our findings indicate that the priority ranking
for substrate preference (i.e. acspm l acspddaspm  spm)
is identical to earlier findings with purified enzyme preparations
[11–13]. lastly, the enzyme-activated irreversible inhibitor of
pao, mdl-72,527 [24,25] completely inhibited the present
enzyme when added prior to the preferred substrate (i.e. acspm).
we note that mdl-72,527 also completely inhibited smo.
while this reveals a lack of specificity of mdl-72,527 for pao,
dual inhibition of smo and pao by mdl-72,527 would be
advantageous when attempting to block intracellular backconversion of spm to spd by both routes. taken together, these
data indicate that the new oxidase is the ssat-coupled oxidase
involved in polyamine back-conversion. although the predicted
molecular mass of the oxidase (approx. 55 kda) is lower than
that originally reported by holtta (approx. 61 kda) [11], we
note that holtta first obtained a molecular mass of approx.
55 kda by molecular sieving experiments and subsequently
arrived at the value of approx. 61 kda from calculations based on
the combined data from molecular sieving and density gradient
centrifugation. unless the protein undergoes considerable posttranslational modification, it would appear that the molecular
sieving data are more correct.
despite the above similarities, certain pao properties revealed
here are not in agreement with earlier biochemical findings.
although, we also found that analogues such as denspm,
despm, dehspm, mespm and n"osspm are substrates of the
present oxidase, the site of oxidative cleavage (i.e. next to an
internal secondary amine) differs from previous reports by other
workers [32–34]. more particularly, prior studies predicted that
pao was capable of n-dealkylation of terminally modified
amines while we find that the reaction involves an internal
cleavage adjacent to a secondary amine. thus despm, dehspm
or denspm are converted to mespd or a corresponding

virtual northern blot based on est data comparing smo and pao expression in various human normal and neoplastic tissues

a virtual northern analysis of the relative gene expression levels in different human tissues for smo and pao genes was performed using diginorthern analysis [32] based on est databases.
the est counts were normalized against the total number of ests available for each tissue to reflect the relative expression levels between different tissues, as well as between the two genes,
as represented by the densities of virtual gel bands. tissues that registered no ests for both genes are not shown (i.e. normal colon). note that there are several normal versus neoplastic comparisons
for a number of tissues.

analogue. regarding this discrepancy, we can only suggest that
the present assay allows for more precise determination of
substrate to product conversion. bergeron et al. [38] observed
significant analogue n-dealkylation in the liver and kidney, and
suggested that it took place via an alternative oxidation system,
such as cytochrome p450. although our present data indicate the
potential for pao to cleave analogues in the intracellular context,
we do not generally observe cleavage products by hplc analysis
of analogue-treated cells (s. vujcic, p. diegelman and c. w.
porter, unpublished work). this may be due to the low basal
levels of pao (as suggested by mrna) and\or to possible
compartmentalized segregation of analogues from enzyme.
# 2003 biochemical society

there are various similarities and differences between pao
and the recently identified smo [3]. the two share 39 % sequence
homology and a different molecular mass (i.e. approx. 55 kda
versus approx. 62 kda respectively). as discussed above, pao
preferentially oxidizes acspm or acspd over spm, whereas
smo prefers spm over acspm or acspd. although both liberate
 xxxd2298xxx , smo generates 3-aminopropanal as a byproduct, whereas pao generates 3-acetamidopropanal. given
the substrate specificity of pao, and the fact that acspm or
acspd are uncommon in most cells, it is not surprising that,
when transfected into hek-293 cells, pao exerts only minor
effects on intracellular polyamine pools. in comparison, trans-

identification of fad-dependent polyamine oxidase
fected smo markedly lowers the readily available spm pools
and causes profound up-regulation of odc activity [3], a
response not elicited by the modest pool shifts brought about by
pao transfection. we have no obvious explanation for the
observation that human smo and mouse pao increase total
intracellular polyamine pools (table 1) except the possibility that
by breaking down polyamines, they increase biosynthetic flux
and\or uptake of polyamines.
although pao and smo are readily inhibited by mdl72,527, they differ distinctly in their interactions with polyamine
analogues. analogues, such as dehspm, despm, denspm
and the calmodulin inhibitor n"osspm, act as competitive
inhibitors [3] and poor substrates of smo. as shown here, these
analogues serve as substrates for pao. this difference may
provide the basis for the design of selective inhibitors of these
enzymes. the analogue studies provide further insights into the
nature of the two enzyme reactions. since pao acts upon
acspm and acspd, the substrate-binding requirement would
seem to specify only two positively-charged amines, whereas
smo requires three. in addition, the data suggest that both smo
and pao preferentially cleave the aminopropyl unit associated
with the ethylated portion of the analogue, as indicated by the
fact that oxidation of mespm consistently yields only spd in
the lysate assay. finally, it is interesting that the analogues are
differentially oxidized by pao, with a priority ranking of
denspmdespmdehspm, a finding that is consistent with
preference for the aminopropyl moieties.
northern blot comparison of pao, smo and ssat mrna
from control and analogue-treated hek-293 cells revealed
several interesting pieces of information. first, it is unexpected
that basal pao mrna levels are much lower than those of
ssat, since dogma suggests that pao activity occurs in excess
of ssat activity, making the latter enzyme rate-limiting in the
back-conversion pathway. the differences in activity could be
related to protein turnover, which is reported to be quite slow for
pao [14] and very rapid for ssat [39]. it is also interesting that
the level of pao mrna is much lower than smo mrna in
hek-293 cells, as determined by northern blot and confirmed in
other tissues by virtual northern analysis based on ests. if
protein and enzyme activity are expressed in parallel with mrna
levels, smo may be the more metabolically important of the two
enzymes. consistent with earlier findings based on the measurement of pao activity [16–18], the results of virtual northern
analysis suggest that pao mrna is lower in most neoplastic
versus normal tissue comparisons. results from the prostate
comparison were especially interesting, since the data suggest
that smo expression is markedly increased in neoplasia, whereas
pao is markedly decreased. although these findings need to be
confirmed experimentally, they are consistent with gene-profiling
studies, indicating that polyamine metabolism is among the most
dysregulated pathways in human prostate cancer [40].
similarly with smo [3,5], pao mrna was found to be
inducible by analogues, an unexpected finding, since ssat has
traditionally been thought to be regulated and rate-limiting,
whereas pao was considered to be constitutively expressed [2].
pao mrna is differentially induced by polyamine analogues in
a manner that parallels induction of ssat and smo mrna.
this suggests the existence of a common regulatory mechanism
for all three genes, perhaps involving the polyamine modulating
transcription cofactor reported by the casero laboratory [41].
an important implication of this finding is that both pao and
smo may be more significant contributors to polyamine
analogue-induced growth inhibition than has been previously
appreciated. the development of molecular reagents relating to
both oxidases will allow for the dissection of their relative roles

27

in both mediating anti-tumour activity and\or host tissue
toxicities of polyamine analogues. such tools will also facilitate
studies on the role of these enzymes in polyamine catabolism and
homoeostasis. in this regard, it would seem that, on the basis of
enzyme function and relative mrna levels, smo may be more
critically involved in the conversion of spm to spd, pao in the
conversion of spd to put, and ssat in the export of polyamines
out of the cell, but this remains to be demonstrated experimentally.
this work was enabled by the many prior contributions of dr nicholas seiler in the
area of polyamine-directed oxidases and was supported in part by the national
cancer institute (grants nci ro1 ca-76428 and ca-22153) and the biostatistics
core of the cancer center support (grant ca-16056).
