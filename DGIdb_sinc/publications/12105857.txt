background & aims: sensitization of kupffer cells (kcs)
to lipopolysaccharide (lps) and overproduction of tumor
necrosis factor (tnf) ␣ are critical for progression of
alcoholic liver injury.  xxxd3342xxx  has been shown to
suppress tnf-␣ production from macrophages. accordingly, the purpose of this study was to determine
whether  xxxd3342xxx  could prevent alcohol-induced liver
injury. methods: rats were given ethanol (5 g/kg body
wt) and  xxxd3342xxx  (5 mg/kg) once every 24 hours
intragastrically. to assess the sensitization of kupffer
cells, lps (5 mg/kg intravenously) was administered
and liver histology was evaluated 24 hours later. kcs
were isolated after 4 weeks of ethanol treatment and
intracellular ca2ⴙ ([ca2ⴙ]i) was measured using fura-2,
whereas tnf-␣ was evaluated by reverse-transcription
polymerase chain reaction and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. cd14 was determined by western and
ﬂuorescence staining. results: treatment with ethanol
for 8 weeks caused marked steatosis, necrosis, and
inﬂammation in the liver. these pathologic parameters
were diminished markedly by treatment with  xxxd3342xxx . in the 4-week ethanol group, the lps-induced liver
damage was aggravated and kcs were sensitized to
lps. coadministration of  xxxd3342xxx  with ethanol prevented the kc sensitization completely. furthermore,
 xxxd3342xxx  abolished the lps-induced increase in
cd14 expression and [ca2ⴙ]i elevation in kcs. gut permeability was increased about 10-fold after 4 weeks of
ethanol exposure, which was not affected by  xxxd3342xxx . moreover,  xxxd3342xxx  reduced the lps-induced
tnf-␣ production by kcs by decreasing tnf-␣ messenger rna. conclusions: these results collectively indicate
that  xxxd3342xxx  prevents alcoholic liver injury through
suppression of tnf-␣ production and abolishment of kc
sensitization.

panied by release of a variety of mediators including
cytokines, eicosanoids, and reactive radical species.4 – 6
among these,  xxxg2296xxx  (tnf) ␣ is a critical
factor in the pathogenesis of alcoholic liver disease because tnf-␣ not only causes cell damage and apoptosis
but stimulates expression of intracellular adhesion molecule 1, culminating in microcirculatory disturbance.7–9
this view is supported by the fact that an anti–tnf-␣
antibody effectively diminished liver injury in the
tsukamoto–french enteral model of alcohol-induced
liver injury, in which a high-fat liquid diet is infused
continuously intragastrically through a cannula implanted in the stomach.10 moreover, tnf-␣ receptorknockout mice were resistant to liver damage caused by
long-term alcohol exposure.11 the critical role of tnf-␣
in the pathogenesis of alcohol-induced liver disease provides a rationale for opposing the actions of tnf-␣ as a
therapeutic modality of alcoholic liver disease.
 xxxd3342xxx  (␣-n-phthalimidoglutarimide) was initially used as a sedative and antiemetic during pregnancy
but was withdrawn from the market due to its teratogenic effects. before it was banned,  xxxd3342xxx  was
recognized to dramatically reduce symptoms associated
with erythema nodosum leprosum, a complication of
hansen’s disease. subsequently, it was shown that  xxxd3342xxx  suppresses production of tnf-␣ by macrophages and other cell types such as activated t cells,12,13
which was attributed to a mechanism of  xxxd3342xxx 
action.14 to date,  xxxd3342xxx  has been used successfully
for the treatment of patients with intractable diseases in
which tnf-␣ is involved in the pathogenesis, including
graft-versus-host disease,15 rheumatoid arthritis,16 sarcoidosis,17 crohn’s disease,18 –20 and ulcerative colitis.21

ncreasing evidence shows that activation of kupffer
cells plays a pivotal role in initiation and progression
of alcoholic liver disease.1,2 kupffer cell activation is
evoked by endotoxin (lipopolysaccharide [lps]), which
leads to rapid elevation of intracellular calcium3 accom-

accordingly, the purpose of this study was to determine whether  xxxd3342xxx  could prevent alcohol-induced liver injury. here we report that  xxxd3342xxx 
prevents liver damage caused by long-term ethanol exposure through not only suppression of tnf-␣ production but also abrogation of kupffer cell sensitization to
lps.

materials and methods
animals and treatments
in this study, a model of alcoholic liver injury based on
the sensitization of kupffer cells, in which rats are given
ethanol (5 g/kg body weight) once every 24 hours,22 was used.
this model achieves inﬂammatory and necrotic changes in the
liver only in 8 weeks, which mimics features of clinical alcohol
liver injury.22 liver damage was evaluated after 8 weeks of
treatment with ethanol because histologic manifestations are
preceded by sensitization of kupffer cells to lps treatment,
and kupffer cell sensitization to lps was evaluated at 4 weeks.
female wistar rats weighing 200 –250 g were fed a liquid diet
(oriental, tokyo, japan). in this diet, 35% of the calories were
from corn oil and 47% were from maltose-dextrin ad libitum.
elements of this diet and percent of calories are described
elsewhere.22 rats were given a single dose of ethanol (5 g/kg
body weight intragastrically)  xxxd1891xxx  –12 am via an 18-gauge
oral gavage every 24 hours.23,24 two groups of rats received an
oral dose of  xxxd3342xxx  (5 mg/kg body weight) only or
concurrently with ethanol.
to assess the sensitization of kupffer cells to lps in vivo,
lps (5 mg/kg, escherichia coli serotype o111:b4, sigma chemical co., st louis, mo) was administered intravenously to
either control or  xxxd102xxx treated rats, and liver histology was
evaluated 24 hours later. all animals were given humane care
in compliance with institutional guidelines. sera were stored at
⫺20°c, and aspartate transaminase (ast) and  xxxg941xxx  (alt) levels were measured by standard enzymatic
procedures.25

pathologic evaluation
liver specimens were obtained from rats 24 hours after
the ﬁnal ethanol on 8 weeks of ethanol (5 g/kg) and 24 hours
after lps (5 mg/kg) on 4 weeks of ethanol. livers were ﬁxed in
formalin, embedded in parafﬁn, and stained with h&e for
assessment of steatosis, inﬂammation, and necrosis.26

kupffer cell preparation and culture
kupffer cells were isolated by collagenase digestion
and differential centrifugation using percoll (pharmacia, uppsala, sweden) as described elsewhere.27 in brief, the liver was
perfused through the portal vein with ca2⫹- and mg2⫹-free
hank’s  xxxd2988xxx  at 37°c for 5 minutes at a ﬂow
rate of 26 ml/min. the perfusate was subsequently changed to
hank’s  xxxd2988xxx  containing 0.025% collagenase
iv (sigma chemical co.) at 37°c for 5 minutes. after diges-

gastroenterology vol. 123, no. 1

tion, the liver was excised and cut into small pieces in collagenase buffer. the suspension was ﬁltered, and the ﬁltrate was
centrifuged at 450g for 10 minutes at 4°c. cell pellets were
resuspended in buffer, parenchymal cells were removed by
centrifugation at 50g for 3 minutes, and the nonparenchymal
cell fraction was washed twice with buffer. cells were centrifuged on a density cushion of percoll at 1000g for 15 minutes,
and the kupffer cell fraction was collected. viability of cells,
determined by trypan blue exclusion, was ⬎90%. cells were
seeded onto 25-mm glass coverslips and cultured in rpmi
1640 (gibco laboratories life technologies, grand island,
ny) plus 10% fetal bovine serum at 37°c with 5% co2.
nonadherent cells were removed after 1 hour by replacing
buffer, and cells were cultured for 24 hours before the experiments were performed.

measurement of intracellular ca2ⴙ using a
fluorescence microscope imaging system
after loading with 4 ␮mol/l fura-2/am solution at
37°c for 30 minutes, kupffer cells on coverslips were installed
in a ﬂuorescence microscope (diaphot; nikon, tokyo, japan)
with a nikon fluor objective lens. a silicon-intensiﬁed target
camera (c-2400; hamamatsu photonics, hamamatsu, japan)
was linked to a computer (maxydt2; mitsubishi, tokyo,
japan), and the ﬂuorescence intensity of fura-2/am was quantiﬁed. wavelengths of 340 nm and 380 nm for excitation and
520 nm for emission were used. intracellular ca2⫹ ([ca2⫹]i)
was determined by the following equation28:
关ca 2⫹ 兴i⫽kd共关ro ⫺ rmin兴/关rmax ⫺ ro兴兲b,
where kd, the ca2⫹ dissociation constant for fura-2, was
conﬁrmed as 224 nmol/l. r represents ﬂuorescence intensity at
340 nm excitation divided by that at 380 nm excitation (ro,
experimental data; rmin, r in 2 mmol/l ethylene glycol-bis
[␤-aminoethyl ether] n,n,n⬘,n⬘-tetraacetic acid and 1
mmol/l  xxxd2379xxx ; rmax is r in 10 mmol/l ca and 1
mmol/l  xxxd2379xxx ). b is the ratio of ﬂuorescence intensity at
380 nm in the absence of ca2⫹ versus a saturating concentration of ca2⫹.

tnf-␣ production by kupffer cells
kupffer cells were seeded onto 24-well plates and
cultured in rpmi 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine
serum and 10 mmol/l hepes at 37°c in the presence of 5%
co2. cells were incubated with fresh media containing lps (0,
100 ng/ml supplemented with 5% rat serum) for an additional 4 hours. tnf-␣ in the culture media was measured
using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit (genzyme,
cambridge, ma).

western blotting for cd14
total protein extracts of liver were obtained by homogenizing samples in a buffer containing 10 mmol/l
hepes, ph 7.6, 25% glycerol, 420 mmol/l nacl, 1.5

mmol/l mgcl2 , 0.2 mmol/l edta, 0.5 mmol/l dithiothreitol, 40 ␮g/ml  xxxd3463xxx , 20 mmol/l ␤-glycerophosphate, 10
mmol/l 4- xxxd2822xxx , 0.5 mmol/l  xxxd502xxx , 0.7
␮g/ml pepstatin a, 2 ␮g/ml aprotinin, 50 ␮mol/l na3vo4 ,
and 0.5 ␮g/ml leupeptin. extracted protein was separated by
10% sodium  xxxd3215xxx /polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to polyvinylidene ﬂuoride membranes.
membranes were blocked by tris-buffered saline/tween 20
containing 5% skim milk and probed with mouse anti-rat
ed9 monoclonal antibody (serotec, oxford, united kingdom), followed by horseradish peroxidase– conjugated secondary antibody as appropriate. membranes were incubated with
a chemiluminescence substrate (ecl reagent; amersham life
science, buckinghamshire, united kingdom) and exposed to
x-omat ﬁlms (eastman kodak co., rochester, ny).

gut permeability
gut permeability was measured in isolated segments of
ileum from translocation of horseradish peroxidase as described
previously.29 in short, 8-cm segments of ileum were everted,
ﬁlled with 1 ml  xxxd3449xxx  (125 mmol/l nacl, 10 mmol/l
fructose, and 30 mmol/l tris; ph 7.5) and ligated at both
ends. the ﬁlled gut segments were incubated in  xxxd3449xxx 
containing 40 mg/100 ml horseradish peroxidase. after 45
minutes, horseradish peroxidase activity in the contents of each
gut sac was determined spectrophotometrically.

rna preparation and reverse-transcription
polymerase chain reaction for tnf-␣
messenger rna
total rna was isolated from kupffer cells with
trizol reagent (invitrogen, carlsbad, ca), and tnf-␣ messenger rna (mrna) was detected by reverse-transcription
polymerase chain reaction (pcr). the speciﬁc primers for
tnf-␣ and ␤-actin used are as follows: tnf-␣, sense (5⬘atgagcacagaaagcatgatcc-3⬘) and antisense (5⬘gaagatgatctgagtgtg-3⬘); ␤-actin, sense (5⬘-gcccagagcaagagaggcat-3⬘) and antisense (5⬘ggccatctcttgctcgaagt-3⬘). the sizes of ampliﬁed
pcr products were 251 base pairs for tnf-␣ and 513 base
pairs for ␤-actin. total rna from the livers was reverse
transcribed into complementary dna in a ﬁrst strand buffer
containing deoxynucleoside triphosphates (takara shuzo,
otsu, japan), ribonuclease inhibitor (roche diagnostics,
mannheim, germany), dithiothreitol, moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase, and oligo dt primer (invitrogen, groningen, the netherlands). the reverse-transcription
reaction was performed at 42°c for 1 hour. the complementary dna was ampliﬁed with pcr method in a pcr buffer
(takara shuzo) containing ampli taq gold (roche diagnostics) and deoxynucleoside triphosphates and the sequencespeciﬁc primers for 33 cycles where each cycle included 30second denaturation at 95°c, 30-second annealing at 50°c,
and 30-second primer extension at 72°c by geneamp pcr
system 9700 (perkin elmer, norwalk, ct). pcr products

were separated on a 2% agarose gel and visualized by ethidium
bromide staining.

fluorescence staining of cd14
kupffer cells were ﬁxed on a plastic dish using cold
pure ethanol for 30 seconds, and the phalloidin-rhodamine
method30 was used for staining actin. indirect immunoﬂuorescence staining was performed for cd14. they were then
incubated overnight with the primary antibody, 1:200 diluted
polyclonal rabbit anti-cd14 and/or actin (m-305; santa cruz
biotechnology, santa cruz, ca). the secondary antibody used
was ﬂuorescein isothiocyanate– conjugated goat anti-rabbit
immunoglobulin g (santa cruz biotechnology). samples were
evaluated and their appearance was recorded on a zeiss axiophot microscope (carl zeiss, oberkochen, germany) with
ektachrome dyna 400 ﬁlms (eastman kodak co.).

statistical analysis
all results were expressed as mean ⫾ sem. statistical
differences between means were determined using analysis of
variance (anova) or anova on ranks or bonferroni’s posthoc test or student t test as appropriate. p ⬍ 0.05 was selected
before the study to reﬂect signiﬁcance.

results
effect of  xxxd3342xxx  on alcoholic
liver injury
there were no differences in body weight growth
among the control,  xxxd3342xxx , ethanol, and ethanol
plus  xxxd3342xxx  groups during 8 weeks of ethanol treatment. all rats survived for 8 weeks. animals treated with
 xxxd3342xxx  only showed completely normal liver histology (figure 1b). administration of ethanol once every 24
hours for 8 weeks caused pronounced pathologic changes
in the liver lobule, including steatosis, necrosis, and
inﬂammation in the liver, conﬁrming our earlier results
(figure 1c and d).22 in marked contrast, these pathologic changes were prevented almost completely by coadministration of  xxxd3342xxx  (5 mg/kg) (figure 1e).
likewise, alt levels were increased to 91 ⫾ 7 iu/l in
the 8-week ethanol group, which was 3 times higher
than the values in the control, nontreated rats (figure
1g). the increase in alt levels was prevented completely by  xxxd3342xxx . similar results were obtained for
ast values (figure 1f ).
effect of  xxxd3342xxx  on ethanol plus
lps-induced liver injury
in an attempt to evaluate the sensitization of
kupffer cells to lps in vivo, lps (5 mg/kg) was administered intravenously and liver histology was evaluated
24 hours later. lps caused focal necrosis with neutrophil

inﬁltration in the control liver (figure 2a). in the group
treated with  xxxd3342xxx  for 4 weeks, liver histology
showed only slight inﬁltration of neutrophils but no
evidence of necrosis (figure 2b). this result agrees with
serum transaminase levels, which were slightly lower in
the group treated with lps only (figure 2f and g). in
the 4-week ethanol group, lps injection resulted in
marked aggravation of these pathologic parameters (figure 2c and d). moreover, steatosis was prominent in this
group. treatment with  xxxd3342xxx  dramatically improved liver injury as shown in figure 2e, which exhibited near normal histology. the increased alt levels
observed 24 hours after lps injection in the 4-week
ethanol group, which were 1200 ⫾ 375 iu/l, were
blocked completely by  xxxd3342xxx  (219 ⫾ 179 iu/l;
p ⬍ 0.05) (figure 2g). similar results were obtained
with ast values (figure 2f ).
effect of  xxxd3342xxx  and ethanol on lpsinduced increases in [ca2ⴙ]i and tnf-␣
production in isolated kupffer cells
to further determine the effect of  xxxd3342xxx  on
 xxxd102xxx induced kupffer cell sensitization to lps, lpsinduced increase of [ca2⫹]i and lps-induced production
of tnf-␣ were measured.22 as reported previously, lps
evoked a transient increase in [ca2⫹]i of kupffer cells
obtained from control rats from basal levels to 81 ⫾ 13
nmol/l (figure 3a and e). after the peak increase,
[ca2⫹]i declined rapidly, returning to basal value. treatment with  xxxd3342xxx  did not alter the [ca2⫹]i response
(figure 3b and e). in contrast, the lps-induced peak
[ca2⫹]i elevation was about 2-fold to 3-fold greater
(227 ⫾ 26 nmol/l) in kupffer cells isolated from rats
given ethanol for 4 weeks (figure 3c). after the peak
increase, [ca2⫹]i started to decrease but remained elevated over 180 seconds (figure 3c). the increased
[ca2⫹]i response was blocked completely by concurrent
administration of  xxxd3342xxx  with ethanol for 4 weeks
(figure 3c–e).

figure 3. effect of ethanol and  xxxd3342xxx  on lps-induced increases
in [ca2⫹]i in isolated kupffer cells. isolated kupffer cells were cultured
in 35-mm culture dishes at a density of 5 ⫻ 105 cells/dish for
measurement of [ca2⫹]i. [ca2⫹]i was measured using a microspectrometer with the ﬂuorescent indicator, fura-2. changes in [ca2⫹]i

 xxxd3342xxx  alone did not alter the basal value of gut

change the amount of cd14 protein (figure 5, lane 2);
however, the band was far more intense in livers from

different between the  xxxd102xxx only and ethanol plus  xxxd3342xxx  groups (140 ⫾ 51 vs. 99 ⫾ 40 pg/ml; not
signiﬁcant).
effect of  xxxd3342xxx  on lps-induced
tnf-␣ mrna expression and tnf-␣
production in cultured kupffer cells
tnf-␣ plays a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of
alcoholic liver injury, and inhibition of tnf-␣ production from kupffer cells is an obvious possibility that may
explain the mechanism by which  xxxd3342xxx  prevented
liver injury caused by long-term treatment with ethanol.
therefore, the effect of  xxxd3342xxx  on lps-induced
tnf-␣ expression in cultured kupffer cells was determined.
after addition of lps (100 ng/ml) to kupffer cells
isolated from the untreated, control rats, the amount of
tnf-␣ mrna increased and reached a maximal value
after 1 hour, followed by a gradual decline over 2 hours
(data not shown). inclusion of  xxxd3342xxx  (5 ␮mol/
l)12,13 in the culture media did not alter the peak level of
tnf-␣ mrna occurring at 1 hour after addition of lps.
however, 3 hours after addition of lps, the amount of
tnf-␣ mrna in kupffer cells treated with  xxxd3342xxx 
was 30% lower than that of control kupffer cells, indicating that  xxxd3342xxx  accelerated decrease in tnf-␣
mrna (figure 7a and b).  xxxd3342xxx  (5 ␮mol/l)
reduced production of tnf-␣ by kupffer cells challenged with lps (100 ng/ml) for 4 hours (figure 7c).
effect of  xxxd3342xxx  and tnf-␣ on
expression of cd14 in cultured
kupffer cells
to explore the mechanism by which  xxxd3342xxx 
abrogated kupffer cell sensitization to lps caused by
long-term treatment with ethanol, we determined the
effect of tnf-␣ on cd14 expression in kupffer cells
obtained from normal rats in vitro. as shown in figure
8, treatment with tnf-␣ (10 ng/ml) for 24 hours
resulted in enhancement of cd14 expression in kupffer
cells (figure 8b and e). inclusion of  xxxd3342xxx  (5
␮mol/l) in the culture media reduced cd14 expression
to a level comparable to the control (figure 8c and f ).
effect of  xxxd3342xxx  and tnf-␣ on lpsinduced production of tnf-␣ by cultured
kupffer cells
lps-induced production of tnf-␣ by isolated
kupffer cells was compared between groups cultured for
24 hours in the presence or absence of tnf-␣ (10

discussion
 xxxd3342xxx  prevents alcohol-induced
liver injury
in this study, we used a model of alcohol-induced
liver injury based on sensitization of kupffer cells22
because it has been established that sensitization of
kupffer cells to lps and consequent overproduction of
tnf-␣ play a central role in the pathogenesis of alcohol
liver disease.1,2,31 this model makes it possible to achieve
pathologic changes in the liver (e.g., steatosis, inﬂammation, and necrosis) that resemble alterations that occur
in the enteral-feeding model without surgery (figure 1).
in this setting, kupffer cells isolated from rats exposed
long-term to ethanol were sensitized to lps, as evidenced
by the enhanced intracellular calcium responses, as well
as increased production of tnf-␣ (figures 3 and 4).

treated for 24 hours with tnf-␣, (f ) cd14 and actin staining in kupffer cell treated for 24 hours with  xxxd3342xxx  and tnf-␣. data are representative
of 3 individual experiments. (original magniﬁcation 400⫻.)

furthermore, cd14 expression in the rat liver treated
long-term with ethanol was greatly enhanced (figure 5).
as a result, administration of lps to rats treated with
ethanol for 4 weeks resulted in aggravation of liver injury
(figure 2).
the results of this study show that  xxxd3342xxx  prevented liver injury caused by long-term treatment with
ethanol (figure 1). to investigate the mechanism of
inhibitory effects of  xxxd3342xxx  against  xxxd102xxx induced
liver injury, we determined if  xxxd3342xxx  directly acted
on kupffer cells, thereby reducing production of tnf-␣.
as shown in figure 7,  xxxd3342xxx  did not affect the
levels of tnf-␣ mrna in kupffer cells after 1 hour of
challenge with lps but later reduced the amounts of
tnf-␣ mrna. consequently, the lps-induced tnf-␣
synthesis by kupffer cells was inhibited by  xxxd3342xxx .
this result agrees with an earlier report showing that
 xxxd3342xxx  abrogated lps-induced production of
tnf-␣ from macrophages.12,13 it was reported that  xxxd3342xxx  decreases production of tnf-␣ by accelerating
the degradation of its mrna.13 however, more recently,
it has been suggested that multiple pathways are involved in the  xxxd3342xxx  action, including inhibition of
nuclear factor ␬b activity through suppression of i␬b
kinase activity.32 it is notable that  xxxd3342xxx  blocked

 xxxd102xxx induced liver pathology almost completely. this
action seems least likely solely due to reduction of
mrna because concomitant administration of  xxxd3342xxx  led to only a partial (50%) reduction of tnf-␣
production by kupffer cells isolated from rats treated for
4 weeks with ethanol. furthermore, it has been shown by
us (figure 7) and other investigators12,13 that, even at the
highest concentrations (5 ␮mol/l to 1 mmol/l) of  xxxd3342xxx , tnf-␣ synthesis by macrophages challenged
with lps was only partially inhibited.
 xxxd3342xxx  abolishes kupffer cell
sensitization to lps
questions arise as to the mechanism by which
 xxxd3342xxx  blocked liver injury caused by long-term
treatment with ethanol. we focused on the ﬁnding that
 xxxd3342xxx  abrogated completely kupffer cell sensitization to lps, which was reﬂected by suppression of
cd14 expression in kupffer cells to a level comparable to
the control (figure 5) and complete abolishment of intracellular responses induced by lps (figure 3). as reported previously,  xxxd102xxx induced sensitization of
kupffer cells is caused by gut-derived endotoxin and
sensitization in kupffer cells is caused by an increase in
cd14.22 to support this notion, kupffer cell sensitiza-

of tnf-␣ by cultured kupffer cells. kupffer cells were isolated and
cultured for 24 hours with or without tnf-␣ (10 ng/ml). in some
experiments,  xxxd3342xxx  (5 ␮mol/l) was included in culture media in
combination with tnf-␣. subsequently, cells were washed vigorously
with phosphate-buffered saline and challenged for 24 hours with lps
(100 ng/ml). tnf-␣ in media was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. tnf-␣ release after 4 hours of incubation without
lps was 10 ⫾ 2 pg/ml. results are expressed as mean ⫾ sem, n ⫽

tion caused by long-term treatment with ethanol was
blocked by antibiotics in vivo.22 therefore, the effect of
 xxxd3342xxx  on gut permeability was investigated.  xxxd3342xxx , however, did not change gut permeability
(figure 6), indicating that kupffer cells in both groups
were exposed to similar concentrations of lps. to support this notion,  xxxd3342xxx  did not alter lps levels in
portal blood. this argues against the view that  xxxd3342xxx  elicited its effect through regulation of portal lps
concentrations.
tnf-␣ has a pleiotropic cytokine, and regulatory
mechanisms of tnf-␣ production in macrophages and
its intracellular signaling have been studied extensively.33 it was suggested that tnf-␣ acts on macrophages/monocytes to promote its own synthesis and secretion.34 the fact that  xxxd3342xxx  destabilizes tnf-␣
mrna provides a good basis for the use of  xxxd3342xxx 
to treat alcohol-induced liver injury because a recent
work by kishore et al. showed stabilization of tnf-␣
mrna by long-term treatment with ethanol.35 we
hypothesized that an autocrine stimulation by tnf-␣ is
involved in  xxxd102xxx induced kupffer cell sensitization

 xxxd3342xxx  for alcoholic liver disease

299

and that  xxxd3342xxx  interferes with this pathway, leading to abrogation of kupffer cell sensitization.
this scenario is supported by the facts that pretreatment with tnf-␣ led to increased tnf-␣ synthesis in
response to lps and enhancement of cd14 expression in
kupffer cells and that inclusion of  xxxd3342xxx  in the
culture media inhibited this tnf-␣–induced autocrine
activation of tnf-␣ synthesis (figures 8 and 9). furthermore,  xxxd3342xxx  blocked completely the tnf-␣–
induced up-regulation of cd14 in kupffer cells in vitro
(figure 9).
based on these ﬁndings, it is conceivable that once
tnf-␣ production is initiated, an autocrine loop to
further enhance tnf-␣ production and cd14 expression
comes into operation that further augments kupffer cell
sensitization to lps, culminating in aggravation of
tnf-␣ production. because kupffer cells are the largest
macrophage lineage in the body and strategically located
in narrow sinusoids, it seems reasonable to postulate that
the liver microenvironment favors this autocrine kupffer
cell activation to perpetuate. thus, prevention of the
tnf-␣– dependent autocrine acceleration of kupffer cell
sensitization may account for, at least in part, the efﬁcacy
of  xxxd3342xxx .
in addition to inhibiting tnf-␣,  xxxd3342xxx  reportedly decreases expression of interleukin 12.36,37 this
might be explained by the observation that the macrophage sensitization to lps was abrogated by  xxxd3342xxx , which in principle should lead to inhibition of an
array of mediators and cytokines known to be produced
by activated kupffer cells. moreover, the ability of  xxxd3342xxx  to abolish kupffer cell sensitization may prove
 xxxd3342xxx  superior to the speciﬁc anti–tnf-␣ therapies. the precise mechanisms of the  xxxd3342xxx  actions
remain to be pursued; however, the results of this study
suggest that  xxxd3342xxx  prevents liver injury caused by
long-term consumption of ethanol by destabilizing
tnf-␣ mrna and abolishing kupffer cell sensitization
to lps. although its side effects currently preclude the
use of  xxxd3342xxx  in clinical settings and require rigors
of the drug distribution program and prescription decision, efforts to synthesize  xxxd3342xxx  analogues lacking
teratogenic effects but having more potent efﬁcacy are
underway.38 given that  xxxd3342xxx  has unique mechanisms of actions, there seems to be a strong possibility
that this type of drug will prove beneﬁcial for patients
with severe alcoholic liver injury.
