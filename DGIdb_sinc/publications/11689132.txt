abstract

three functional herg channel assay methods have been developed and evaluated. the methods were tested against
five known herg channel inhibitors: dofetilide, terfenadine (seldane),  xxxd3195xxx  ( xxxd3195xxx ),  xxxd236xxx  ( xxxd236xxx ),
and  xxxd1708xxx  (propulsid). the dibac,(3)-based assays were found to be the most economical but had high false-
hit rates as a result of the interaction of dye with the test compounds. the membrane potential dye assay had fewer
color-quenching problems but was expensive and still gave false hits. the nonradioactive rb* efflux assay was the
most sensitive of all the assays evaluated and had the lowest false-hit rate.

introduction

ty gene known as herg, the human homolog of the ei-
ther-a-go-go (eag)-related gene (erg) of the fruitfly
drosophila melanogaster, encodes a  xxxg1232xxx  whose
activity is critical for the regulation of membrane potential in
cardiac myocytes. loss-of-function mutations in this channel
are associated with the potentially lethal inherited long qt syn-
drome ( xxxg1268xxx ).!* pharmacological blockage of the herg chan-
nel leads to the development of acquired  xxxg1268xxx .? acquired  xxxg1268xxx 
can be induced by different classes of therapeutic agents, in-
cluding antiarrhythmics,* antibiotics,>© antihistamines,”® an-
tipsychotics,”!° and prokinetic agents.!!-!? since 1997, 5 of the
11 prescription drugs that were withdrawn from the u.s. mar-
ket were withdrawn as a result of their potential to inhibit the
herg channel and thus causing  xxxg1268xxx  syndrome.!* consider-
ing the expense associated with clinical trials, it is financially
beneficial for pharmaceutical companies to conduct early com-
pound safety assessments to eliminate chemical agents that
have the potential to induce qt prolongation. this concern is
also shared by many regulatory agencies in different countries,
highlighted by the publication of points to consider by the
committee for proprietary medicinal products (cpmp) of the
european agency for evaluation of medicinal products
(emea) in 1997. in this document, the cpmp listed a series

of in vivo and in vitro assays for pharmaceutical companies to
assess the  xxxg1268xxx  liability of noncardiovascular therapeutic
agents.'* the ability of a compound to inhibit the herg chan-
nel was regarded as an important indication of its possible  xxxg1268xxx 
liability.!>-!®

however, the number of methods available for functional
herg channel measurement is limited. patch-clamp technology
is sensitive and reliable but labor intensive. the ability to screen
large amount of compounds using this technology is not presently
available. another relatively reliable and medium throughput
screening method is the rb-86—based radioactive assay. however,
many high throughput screening (hts) labs are reluctant to use
this assay format because of the highly radioactive nature of rb-
86. the recent development of a nonradioactive rb* assay has
greatly enhanced the ease of using this system.!” other potential
functional  xxxg1232xxx  assays use membrane-sensitive flu-
orescent dyes. one of the most widely used oxonol dyes is bis-
(1,3-dibutylbarbituric acid)trimethine oxonol (dibac,(3)). re-
cently, molecular devices (sunnyvale, ca) released a new
fluorometric imaging plate reader (flipr®) membrane potential
assay kit (fmp) that has been widely accepted for na* and k*
channel screening. however, both dyes measure the change of
membrane potential instead of channel activity. thus they have
the potential of selecting compounds that change membrane po-
tential but that do not affect channel activity.

here, we compare three potential assay systems for func-
tional herg channel analysis. these three assays are the
dibac,(3), molecular devices’ fmp dye, and the nonra-
dioactive rb* assay. the throughput, sensitivity, and false-hit
rate of the three methods are compared.

materials and methods

dna and cell line selection

the herg channel expression vector and stable cell line
(cho-k1) construction were described previously.©  xxxg418xxx -re-
sistant clones were transferred into 96-well plates and screened
for activity using the dibac,(3) assay as described below. the
transfected cells were cultured in ham’s f-12 medium supple-
mented with 10% fetal bovine serum (fbs; life technologies,
gaithersburg, md), 1 x penicillin/streptomycin, and 500 g/ml
of  xxxg418xxx . the cell density was kept below 80% confluency prior
to microplate culture. the herg cells were dispensed into mi-
croplates with a multidrop (labsystems, helsinki, finland) at
a density of 10,000 cells/well into a 384-well plate or a den-
sity of 50,000 cells/well into a 96-well plate (costar®, tc-
treated plate; corning incorporated, acton, ma). the plates
were incubated at 37°c for a minimum of 12 h prior to the
channel functional assays.

dibac4(3) assay method

cells were loaded with 5 um dibac,(3) in hank’s/hepes
buffer (hank’s solution, 20 mm hepes [ph 7.4], 0.2% glu-
cose) and incubated at 37°c for 30 min before adding kci to
a final concentration of 50 mm with a flipr to activate the
herg channel. the temperature was kept constant at 37°c by
using the flipr heated stage as well as preheated compounds
and buffers. a panel of the five known herg channel inhibitors
were tested at concentrations of 10, 1, 0.1, 0.01, and 0.001 um.
the response to potassium addition without compound was
used as a control. sample curves were plotted as the difference

tang et al.

of the observed response to that of the control. a plate of com-
pounds from the aventis collection was screened at a final con-
centration of 10 4m. compounds whose response was less than
3 sd from that of the control were presumed not to inhibit the
herg channel (flipr negative) and those more than 3 sd
from the control were designated as herg channel inhibitors
(flipr positive). selected compounds from this screening
were further tested using the patch-clamp method as described
below.

patch-clamp analysis

herg channel currents were recorded with an axopatch
200b amplifier (axon instruments, union city, ca) at room
temperature using the whole-cell configuration of the patch-
clamp technique.!® thin-walled glass capillary tubes (world
precision instruments, sarasota, fl) were fabricated to a direct
current resistance of 3-6 mq. electrodes were filled with the
following solutions (in mm): potassium aspartate, 120; kcl,
20; nazatp, 4.0; hepes, 5.0; mgcl, 1.0 (ph adjusted to 7.2
with koh). the external solution contained (in mm): nacl,
130; kci, 5; sodium acetate, 2.8; mgclo, 1.0; hepes, 10; glu-
cose, 10; caclo, 1.0 (ph adjusted to 7.4 with naoh). current
readings were digitally stored and analyzed using the pclamp
suite of software (axon instruments).

fmp dye

the cells were washed with hank’s/hepes buffer 3 times,
and then 25 yl of the loading buffer was added (hank’s/20 mm
hepes buffer; ph 7.4) with a multimek™ (beckman coulter,
inc., fullerton, ca). next 25 yl of the loading dye (loading
buffer with 1x dye) was added and the cells were incubated at
room temperature for 30 min. compounds were added and the
cells were incubated for another 10 min before the response to
50 mm kci was measured with the flipr. a compound plate
containing 88 aventis compounds was screened at a final con-
centration of 10 4m, and samples with a response more than
3 sd from the negative control were selected as herg chan-
nel inhibitors (positive). the selected compounds were retested
by patch clamp.

dye—compound interaction test

an aliquot of 45 yl of 1x dye was added to a 384-well plate
with or without cells. five microliters of one of the selected com-
pounds was added to each well and the signal was measured with
the flipr 5 min thereafter. the color-quenching effect was cal-

“compounds that inhibit over 50% of the herg channel current at a con-
centration of 1 4m were designated “+” or strong herg channel inhibitors;
compounds that inhibit less than 50% of the herg channel current at a con-

culated by determining the ratio of the reading of samples with
compounds to the reading with buffer alone. four different con-
ditions were tested: buffer alone, buffer with cho cells, buffer
with 1% fbs, and buffer alone with 100 4.£m compound.

rb* efflux assay

a total of 50,000 herg transfected cells/well were plated
into a clear black 96-well plate (costar #3603). after overnight
culture at 37°c, the herg cells were washed with buffer i (150
mm nacl, 2 mm cach, 0.8 mm nah2po,, 1 mm mgch, 5
mm glucose, 25 mm hepes; ph 7.4) three times. then 200
ul of rb* loading buffer (buffer i with 5.4 mm rbcl) was
added and the cells were incubated at 37°c for 4 h. the com-
pounds were added and the cells were incubated at 37°c for
another 30 min. the rb* buffer was then removed by wash-
ing the cells 3 times with 200 wl of 5 mm kcl washing buffer
(buffer i with 5 mm kcl). the herg channel was activated
by adding 200 yl of 50 mm kci buffer (buffer i with 50 mm
kcl). the supernatant (sn) was transferred to a new 96-well
plate after 10 min of incubation at room temperature. cells were
lysed by adding 200 yl lysis buffer (1% triton x-100 in buffer
i). rb* concentration in the cells and sn was measured using
the analyst™ 100 atomic adsorbance spectrometer (aas) (pe
bioscience, foster city, ca). rb* efflux rate (re) was calcu-
lated using the formula [rb* sn]/[total rb*]. rb* efflux effi-
ciency was calculated as

rb* efflux efficiency = (resampie — renegative)/

(repositive i renegative)
the five known herg channel inhibitors were tested at final
concentrations of 10, 1, 0.1, 0.01, and 0.001 4m and their

ics values were calculated with abase xlfit (dbs,
emeryville, ca). all data were collected in triplicate.

for screening quality evaluation, four 96-well plates were
tested. twenty-one wells of each 96-well plate were treated
with 10 wm  xxxd236xxx  and the rb* efflux of the  xxxd236xxx -
treated samples was calculated and used as the low control. the
other 72 wells were treated with buffer only and their rb* ef-
flux efficiencies were calculated and used as high control. the
other 3 wells were spotted with unknown compounds. one 96-
well plate of vector control cells was also tested for rb*~ ef-
flux rate. the z factor was calculated as described by zhang
et al.!9

forty-two compounds with known icsg values and 36 un-
known compounds were tested in this format at a final con-
centration of 10 um. all samples were tested in triplicate, and
the compounds were tested with patch-clamp technology for
validation.

results

cell line selection

five cell lines were selected out of 400 screened with the
dibac,(3) flipr assay. four of the cell lines quickly lost
their channel activity during cell line maintenance. however,
one cho cell line, named p15c, was found to have a detectable
and stable signal. this cell line was later used in all of the as-
says in this report.

dibac4{3) assay

the herg channel cells were exposed to compound before
being activated by 50 mm of kci. a test of a panel of five
known herg channel inhibitors indicated that this assay has
a minimal detection dose (mdd) of 1, 10, 1, 1, and 10 um
for dofetilide,  xxxd3195xxx , terfenadine,  xxxd236xxx , and cis-
apride, respectively (fig. 1; table 1). the mdd of each com-
pound was 100-fold higher than its respective ics5 9 value as
measured by patch-clamp electrophysiology. the mdd rank-
ings of these compounds did not match with the ranking of

for identifying potential herg channel inhibitors and could
not be used for ranking compounds by their potency. screen-
ing of a panel of 88 compounds selected 7 compounds as
herg channel inhibitors and 81 as noninhibitors. ten of the
noninhibitors were retested with patch-clamp electrophysiol-
ogy and nine compounds were reconfirmed (table 2). how-
ever, five of the seven positive compounds did not reconfirm
with such retesting (table 2).

dofetilide,  xxxd3195xxx ,  xxxd1708xxx , terfenadine, and  xxxd236xxx 
were tested with this dye system and were all found to be posi-
tive, with mdds of 0.1, 10, 10, 1, and 0.1 4m, respectively (fig.
2). like the dibac,(3)-based assay, the detection limits were
higher than the respective compounds’ icso values as measured
by electrophysiology. the ranking of the mdds of these com-
pounds did not match with the ranking of their [c59 values either.
however, examination of a panel of 88 compounds indicated that
screening herg channel modulators with this dye may have a
lower false-hit rate than that of the diibac,(3) method (table 3).

color-quenching effect on a fluorescence-based detection
system

the herg channel inhibitors terfenadine and  xxxd236xxx 
quenched the dibac,4(3) signal by as much as 50%  xxxd1891xxx  um
in the presence of cho cells (fig. 3a). however, these com-
pounds did not appear to quench the signal from the new fmp
dye. this behavior was the same whether cells were present or
not (fig. 3b). the addition of 1% fbs, which increased the
dibac,(3) signal by 100%, did not affect the signal of the
fmp dye (fig. 3c). thus, the fmp dye had less compound—dye
interaction than did dibac,(3). however, there was still a de-
tectable color-quenching effect when 100 44m  xxxd236xxx  or ter-
fenadine was used (fig. 3d). thus this new dye is not free of
compound—dye interaction, at least at high drug concentrations.

channels were activated by adding 50 mm kci. after the herg

ues with patch-clamp technique. thus, the rb* aas assay can
be used for ranking unknown compounds’ herg channel potency
and meets the requirement for compound profiling.

this assay was further developed for the hts standard eval-
uation. the average herg activity for cells treated with 10 um
 xxxd236xxx  was 0, with a standard deviation of 5.8%. cells
without any channel blockers had an average herg channel
activity of 92% and standard deviation of 8.5%. the z factor
calculated based on those 384 samples was 0.53. thus this as-
say was validated to meet hts standards.'? a data normaliza-
tion plot indicated that this assay has a good window to sepa-
rate negative compounds from positive ones (fig. 6).?°[fig6]
a 78-compound plate was screened at a final concentration of
10 4m with this method, and 33 compounds were found to
have low potency for the herg channel. thirty compounds
were reconfirmed by the patch-clamp technique to have [cso
values over 1.5 um. forty-five compounds were determined to
be positive (potent herg channel blocker) with this assay.
thirty-six of the positive compounds were tested with the
patch-clamp technique and all of those were found to have icso
values less than 1 um.

discussion

the development of a functional herg channel assay, as for
other voltage-gated potassium channels, is hindered by the lack
of reliable detection methods. two traditional methods are
widely accepted as standard methods for a  xxxg1232xxx 
functional assay. one is patch-clamp electrophysiology, which
330

measures channel currents directly and is regarded as the most
reliable functional  xxxg1232xxx  assay available. how-
ever, this is a labor-intensive and low throughput assay and thus
does not meet today’s need for quick profiling of primary hits
from hts. the throughputs of this assay are at best on the or-
der of 10-20 compounds per day, depending on the re-
searcher.”! conversion of this technology to hts is still not a
possibility and not seriously considered by most hts labora-
tories. the other method for a functional  xxxg1232xxx  as-
say is the rb-86 efflux assay. this assay is based on the idea
that potassium channels can transport not only k* ions but also
rb* ions. since mammalian cells do not have intrinsic rb*
ions, any concentration change can easily be detected by mea-
suring the radioactivity change of the rb-86. however, hts
assay development based on this readout is not a favorite among
hts laboratories because rb-86 is highly radioactive.

fluorescence-based assays have been widely pursued as an
alternative potential hts readout for  xxxg1232xxx  tar-
gets. many of the successful high throughput functional potas-
sium channel assays developed thus far have been focused on
the synthesis of membrane potential—sensitive dyes.?*
dibac,(3) is one of the most widely used membrane poten-
tial dyes. its distribution across biological membranes is de-
pendent on membrane potential. thus the fluorescence signal
change can be used as a surrogate marker of potassium chan-
nel function. however, less than 20% of the dye signal change
detected is associated with a 100-mv membrane potential
change. thus the development of a direct fluorescence signal
change is dependent on the channel activity. cells expressing
herg channels may have small currents, so the membrane po-
tential changes associated with the blockage of this potassium
channel may be limited. this is translated into a small fluores-
cence signal for this assay. one method to increase the signal
is to increase cell number, as described in the dibac,(3) sec-
tion of materials and methods. a high concentration of kcl
(50 mm) was applied in order to activate the herg channels.
high cell number combined with the high concentration of
potassium ion in the medium may contribute to the low sensi-
tivity of the dibac,(3) assay. as shown in the results section,
the mdds of the five herg channel inhibitors are 100 times
higher than the reported ics values obtained with the patch-
clamp technique. the screening of herg channel inhibitors
with this format was further complicated by the finding that
three of the five compounds tested showed a strong quenching
effect on the dye signal. compounds that quench the dye sig-
nal could be misidentified as herg channel inhibitors. this
could contribute to the fact that the mdd sequence of the com-
pounds tested did not match with their respective ics59 values
as determined with the patch-clamp technique.

a second assay format was reported by gonzalez and co-
workers using the fluorescence resonance energy transfer mech-
anism.*>4 the combination of the dyes with voltage/ion probe
reader equipment has greatly increased the assay sensitivity and
reduced the data variation.*? however, the expense of this sys-
tem may keep many research laboratories and companies from
using this technology.

molecular devices’ fmp dye provided a third tool for the
 xxxg1232xxx  functional assay. the dye was reported to
be temperature insensitive and quickly responsive to membrane
potential changes.*© application of this fmp dye in our herg

tang et al.

channel screen suggested that it displayed less dye—compound
interaction. our known inhibitor screening confirmed the ad-
vantage of using this dye. for instance, two known herg chan-
nel inhibitors that quenched the dibac,(3) signal did not in-
terfere with the new fmp dye signal. a comparison of the
results for the 88 aventis compounds screened with dibac,(3)
or fmp dye identified additional compounds that quenched the
dibac4,(3) signal, but not the signal from the new fmp dye
(table 3). thus this dye could provide an alternative system
for membrane potential—based screening. however, this system
measures the membrane potential but not channel activity. thus
compounds affecting other determinants of membrane poten-
tial could be falsely identified as herg channel inhibitors. our
results also indicated that 100 4m  xxxd1708xxx  and terfenadine
quenched the dye signal through compound—dye interaction.

the development of the nonradioactive, aas-based func-
tional herg channel assay has opened up yet another avenue
of screening. it has previously been reported to work for both
 xxxg1229xxx  and  xxxg1233xxx  k* channels with reasonable throughput.!”
our data suggested that this assay had a z factor of 0.53 in the
96-well format for the herg channel assay. although the ics
values of the known herg channel inhibitors are 5- to 20-fold
higher than their respective ics) values as measured with the
patch-clamp technique in mammalian cells, the [c59 values are
similar to those reported with herg channels expressed in
xenopus oocytes.”’78 most important of all, this assay gener-
ated ics9 values with a ranking order similar to that determined
with the patch-clamp technique.

conclusions

we have evaluated different assay formats for functional
herg channel inhibition. the nonradioactive rb* efflux as-
say was proven to have the lowest false-hit rate. the assay was
also optimized as a 96-well—based medium throughput assay.
current throughput of our system is limited by the aas de-
tection speed. our system can process up to 200 samples per
hour.
