ngal (human  xxxg1428xxx -associated lipocalin) and its
mouse analogue  xxxg1309xxx  are members of the lipocalin family of small
secreted proteins. these proteins are up-regulated in a number of
pathological conditions, including cancers, and may function as
transporters of essential factors. although previous publications
have suggested that  xxxg1309xxx  has pro-apoptotic functions, other data
are more suggestive of a survival function. the current study was
designed to determine whether ngal is pro- or anti-apoptotic.
apoptosis induced in human adenocarcinoma a549 cells by the
 xxxg147xxx -activating-protein inhibitor mk886, or several
celecoxib-derived  xxxg1718xxx  (phosphoinositide-dependent kinase 1)
inhibitors that are devoid of cyclo-oxygenase-2 inhibitory activity,
was accompanied by a dose- and time-dependent increase of
ngal mrna levels, as was reported previously with  xxxg1309xxx . a
similar induction of ngal mrna was observed in human breast
cancer mcf7 cells treated with mk886, indicating this was not
a cell-specific effect. treatment of a549 cells with up to 150 µg/

106 cells of purified recombinant ngal protein had no effect on
viability, whereas antisera against the full-length ngal protein
induced apoptosis in these cells. the stable overexpression of
ngal in a549 cells had no effect on proliferation or viability.
however, the cell death induced by a  xxxg1718xxx  inhibitor was reduced
by 50 % in ngal-overexpressing cells. decreasing ngal
mrna and protein expression with sirna (small interfering
rna) in a549 cells increased the toxicity of a  xxxg1718xxx  inhibitor
by approx. 45 %. these data indicate that, although the induction
of ngal correlates with apoptosis, this induction represents a
survival response. because ngal is a secreted protein, it may
play an extracellular role in cell defence against toxicants and/or
facilitate the survival of the remaining cells.

introduction

that ngal is a potent bacteriostatic agent by sequestering iron
[9,10]. another study [11] indicated ngal is capable of protecting  xxxg1440xxx  ( xxxg1440xxx ) from degradation by
interacting with this protein. it has also been reported that ngal
can protect against acute ischaemic renal injury [12]. overall, the
full functional repertoire of ngal remains to be exposed.
as a secreted binding protein, ngal may play a role in transport or signalling with survival/growth factors. recently,  xxxg1309xxx , a
mouse homologue of ngal (ngal and  xxxg1309xxx  are 62 % identical
in amino acid sequence [13]), was suggested to play a crucial
role in il (interleukin)-3 deprivation [14] and mk886 [a flap
( xxxg147xxx -activating protein) inhibitor]-induced apoptosis
[15] in murine pro-lymphoid progenitor fl5.12 cells. in addition,
 xxxg1309xxx  is expressed at high levels in the mouse mammary gland and
uterus, where it is proposed to induce apoptosis, thereby allowing
selected cells to survive involution [16,17]. however, although
these studies showed an association of  xxxg1309xxx  with apoptosis, a
cause–effect relationship was  xxxd3237xxx , and other work
indicates that this lipocalin is not universally involved in growthfactor-withdrawal apoptosis [18].
to clarify the overall functions of ngal, the present study
was designed to determine whether this lipocalin is pro- or antiapoptotic. our previous work demonstrated that the murine  xxxg1309xxx 
was profoundly induced by mk886 [15]. the present study
demonstrates that a similar induction of the analogous human
protein, ngal, is seen in human lung non-small cell cancer
a549 cells and breast cancer mcf7 cells treated with mk886.
induction of ngal was also evident with a series of celecoxibderived agents that induce apoptosis, but lack the ability to inhibit

lipocalins are a diverse family of over 20 small soluble, and
often secreted, proteins. they have a large degree of diversity at
the sequence level (only 20 % identity), although most share three
conserved motifs. these proteins are defined as lipocalins largely
on the basis of their three-dimensional structure, which comprises
a single eight-stranded, continuously hydrogen-bonded antiparallel beta-barrel. this antiparallel structure forms an enclosing
cavity that is thought to bind a wide variety of low-molecularmass molecules, including retinoids,  xxxd208xxx , various
steroids and iron (reviewed in [1,2]). thus lipocalins are generally
considered as transporters with several different functions. these
functions include the regulation of immune responses, modulation
of cell growth and metabolism, transportation of iron and prostaglandin synthesis [1].
ngal ( xxxg1428xxx -associated lipocalin) was first
purified from human neutrophils because of its association with
gelatinase, although this association appears to be functionally
irrelevant [3]. ngal exists as a 25 kda monomer, 46 kda disulphide-linked homodimer and a 135 kda disulphide-linked heterodimer with  xxxg1428xxx  [3]. ngal is thought to be
an acute phase protein [4] whose expression is up-regulated in
humans, typically in epithelial cells, under diverse inflammatory
conditions including appendicitis, inflammatory bowel disease
and diverticulitis [5]. elevated ngal expression is also observed
in human cancers, such as breast [6], colorectal [5], pancreatic
[7] and ovarian [8] cancer. however, there is little information
regarding the functions of ngal. several studies have suggested

key words: apoptosis,  xxxg1428xxx -associated lipocalin
(ngal), survival factor,  xxxg1309xxx  protein.

cox-2 (cyclo-oxygenase-2). rather, these agents, as well as
mk886, appear to act through an inhibition of  xxxg1718xxx  (phosphoinositide-dependent kinase 1) ([19], and c.-s. chen, unpublished work). although the induction of ngal was temporally correlated with apoptosis, this appears to be a response to,
not a cause of, cell death. specifically, exogenously added ngal
protein was non-toxic, and the overexpression of ngal provided some protection from pdk-1 inhibitor-induced apoptosis,
whereas the down-regulation of ngal resulted in an increased
toxicity to these xenobiotics, and polyclonal antisera against fulllength ngal induced apoptosis. overall, these data suggest that
ngal plays a role in cell survival, and can provide protection
from the apoptosis induced by  xxxg1718xxx  inhibitors.
materials and methods
cell culture

human lung adenocarcinoma a549 cells obtained from the
american type culture collection (manassas, va, u.s.a.) and
human breast cancer mcf7 cells obtained from dr kimberly
kline (university of texas at austin; these cells were originally
obtained from dr suzanne fuque, university of texas health
sciences center, san antonio, tx, u.s.a.) were used. a549
cells were cultured in dulbecco’s modified eagle’s medium
supplemented with 10 % (v/v) fetal bovine serum (atlanta
biologicals, norcross, ga, u.s.a.) and 50 µg/ml gentamicin.
mcf-7 cells were cultured in minimum essential medium with
earle’s balanced salts supplemented with 10 % fetal bovine serum
plus 2 mm glutamine, 100 µg/ml streptomycin, 100 units/ml
penicillin, 1× (v/v) non-essential amino acids and 10 mm hepes.
cells were passaged at 70 % confluence using 1 mm edta/
0.025 % trypsin for 3–5 min.
reagents and treatments

mk886 was obtained from biomol research laboratories
(plymouth meeting, pa, u.s.a.). osu03013 and osu03012
(celecoxib-derived  xxxg1718xxx  inhibitors that are devoid of cox-2
inhibitory activity) were synthesized as described in [19].
recombinant ngal protein was a gift from dr roland strong
(fred hutchinson cancer research center, seattle, wa, u.s.a.).
polyclonal rabbit anti-ngal antiserum was generated by sigmagenosys (the woodlands, tx, u.s.a.) using recombinant ngal
protein. anti-flag antibodies were purchased from sigma (st
louis, mo, u.s.a.). all chemicals were dissolved in dmso.
exponentially growing cells were used for all experiments. before
treatment, a549 and mcf7 cells were plated and allowed to
adhere overnight. all treatments, including appropriate vehicle
controls, were added directly to the culture medium.
measurements of apoptosis

apoptosis of a549 cells was detected by several methods: (1) the
sub-g1 population of cells was determined by flow cytometry
in  xxxd102xxx fixed cells stained with pi ( xxxd3027xxx ), as
described in [20]; (2) caspase-3 cleavage was determined by
western blotting, as described below; (3) histone-associated
dna fragments were measured using the cell death detection
elisa kit following the manufacturer’s instructions (roche
applied science, indianapolis, in, u.s.a.); and (4) nuclear condensation was visualized by staining cells with dapi (4,6diamidino-2-phenylindole). for the elisa assay, lysates from
treated and untreated cells were added into a 96-well plate that
was previously coated with streptavidin, and incubated with
biotinylated anti-histone and anti-dna antibodies for 2 h at room


temperature (≈ 24 ◦c). results were obtained as the a405−490
nm and expressed as the change relative to controls, indicating
the relative enrichment of nucleosomes in the cytoplasm. for
dapi staining, cells were exposed to 2 µg/ml dapi in 100 %
methanol for 15 min. the stained cells were then visualized with
a fluorescence microscope, and photos were taken. cells with condensed chromatin or fragmented nuclei were considered as being
apoptotic.
cell viability

cell viability was measured using the promega celltiter
aqueous one solution cell proliferation assay kit (madison,
wi, u.s.a.) according to the manufacturer’s recommended
protocol. the assay depends on the reduction of a tetrazolium
compound mts [3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulphophenyl)-2h-tetrazolium] to formazan. the absorption at 490 nm is directly proportional to the
number of living cells. briefly, treated or untreated cells were
incubated with the reaction solution for 1–2 h at 37 ◦c. the
absorption at 490 nm was measured using a microplate reader.
the results are presented as the percentage of controls.
rna isolation and northern blot analysis

total rna from cells was isolated using the rneasy mini kit following the manufacturer’s protocol (qiagen, valencia, ca,
u.s.a.). total rna (15 µg) was separated in a 1 % denaturing
formaldhyde–agarose gel and transferred to a nylon membrane
(schleicher & schuell, keene, nh, u.s.a.) with 20 × ssc
(3 m nacl/0.3 m sodium citrate). membranes were then crosslinked using a uv stratalinker 2400 (stratagene, la jolla, ca,
u.s.a.) and air-dried. ngal cdna was synthesized by rt-pcr
using primers designed according to the sequence of the ngal
gene. cdna was radiolabelled with [alpha-32 p]dctp using random
primers following the manufacturer’s instructions (invitrogen,
carlsbad, ca, u.s.a.). the radiolabelled cdna was purified
on sephadex g-50 columns (bio-rad, hercules, ca, u.s.a.) and
used as the probe. membranes were probed with the 32 p-labelled
ngal cdna in a hybridization buffer (stratagene) overnight at
68 ◦c. following washing with 1 × ssc and 0.1 % (w/v) sds,
membranes were autoradiographed with an intensifying screen.
band intensities were determined using un-scan-it software
(silk scientific, orem, ut, u.s.a.) on scanned images. a
 xxxg861xxx  ( xxxg861xxx ) cdna
probe was used to normalize rna loading.
plasmid construction and generation of stable
ngal-overexpressing cell lines

to construct the ngal expression plasmid, the full-length human
ngal cdna was synthesized by rt (reverse transcriptase)pcr using the primer designed according to the sequence of the
ngal gene. when used, a flag-tagged sequence was added
on to the c-terminus of the ngal gene. the amplified ngal
cdna or flag-tagged ngal cdna was then subcloned into
the mammalian expression vector pcdna3.1/hisc (invitrogen)
in the sense orientation. the identity and orientation of this construct were confirmed by dna sequencing.
a549 cells were transfected with 2 µg of dna of pcdna3.1/
hisc /ngal using the lipofectaminetm reagent (invitrogen)
according to the manufacturer’s protocol. pcdna3.1/hisc dna
was used as a control. a549 cells stably expressing the pcdna3.1/
hisc /ngal construct were selected in a medium containing
100 µg/ml  xxxg418xxx  ( xxxd2191xxx ) for at least 14 days. the expression

of ngal was determined by western blotting using either antiflag antibodies or ngal antiserum.

results

sirna (small interfering rna) gene silencing

to investigate the relationship between apoptosis and the levels
of ngal expression, the abilities of mk886, osu03012 and
osu03013 to induce apoptosis in a549 cells were first assessed.
flow cytometry of cells stained with pi revealed a prominent dosedependent increase in the sub-g1 peak, indicative of apoptosis
after treatment with osu03012 for 16 h (figure 1a). caspase-3
was also activated at 16 h, as shown by caspase-3 cleavage to
the active 17 kda fragment (figure 1b). using the cell death
detection elisa kit, mk886 induced apoptosis at 24 h in
a549 cells in a dose-dependent manner (figure 1c). following
dapi staining, apoptosis was also evident at 16 h with 7.5 µm
osu03013 (figure 1d). these results are consistent with the
previously reported ability of the  xxxg1718xxx  inhibitors to induce
apoptosis in prostate cancer cells [19], and of mk886 to induce this form of death in various cell lines [21–24].

the sirna sequence used for targeted silencing of ngal gene
was synthesized using the silencer sirna construction kit
(ambion, austin, tx, u.s.a.) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. the ngal sirna oligonucleotides selected were
(sense strand is given): ngal#1, 5 -gggaaugcaauucucagagtt-3 ; ngal#2, 5 -ggacuuuuguuccagguugtt-3 ; and ngal#3, 5 -gggaguacuucaagaucactt-3 .
an sirna targeted to no known gene (ambion) was used as
a negative control. the synthetic double-stranded sirna oligonucleotides were then delivered into a549 cells using different
doses of oligofectamine transfection reagent (invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s recommended protocol. reduction in
ngal gene expression by ngal sirna was measured by
real-time rt-pcr 72 h post-transfection, and also by assessing
the amount of ngal protein secreted into the medium at this
time.
real-time rt-pcr analysis

total rna from sirna-transfected a549 cells was isolated using
the rnaqueous® mag-96 kit (ambion). the purified, dnasetreated rna was reverse-transcribed with random decamers
using the retroscript® kit (ambion). gene expression levels
were determined by real-time rt-pcr using supertaqtm real
time reagents (ambion) on the abi prism 7900 sds (applied
biosystems, foster city, ca, u.s.a.). the ngal data were
collected using a primer set (forward, gtaggcctggcagggaatg; reverse, ggaacaaaagtcctgatccagtagtc),
in combination with sybr® green technology (invitrogen).
18 s rrna was amplified [forward, ttgactcaacacgggaaacct; reverse, agaaagagctatcaatctgtcaatcct; probe, 5 -vic-acccggcccggacacgga-tamra-3
(‘vic’ and ‘tamra’ are standard fluorescent dyes)] as an endogenous control to adjust for well-to-well variances in the amount
of starting template. the values were normalized to a sample
transfected with the silencertm negative control #1 sirna
(ambion).

induction of apoptosis

the induction of ngal expression by mk886

our previous work showed that  xxxg1309xxx , a mouse analogue of ngal,
is an mk886-inducible gene [15]. although ngal is analogous,
it is not identical to  xxxg1309xxx . furthermore, in contrast with  xxxg1309xxx ,
which is virtually undetectable in murine prob cells under basal
conditions [15], ngal mrna is expressed basally at readily
detectable levels in human lung adenocarcinoma a549 cells
(figure 2). it was necessary, therefore, to determine whether the
expression of ngal could be induced by mk886. the expression
of ngal mrna was detected by northern blotting using ngal
cdna as a probe. expression was induced in a549 cells in a timeand dose-dependent manner by treatment with mk886 (figure 2).
an increase in ngal mrna levels was evident with 30 µm
mk886, and a further increase with 40 µm at 16 h. the earliest
detectable increase in ngal mrna above control levels using
30 µm mk886 was after 16 h. this increase was maintained to at
least 24 h. similar results were observed in human breast cancer
mcf7 cells, although basal ngal expression was not evident,
and somewhat higher doses of mk886 were needed in this cell
line, both to induce mrna (figure 3) and to cause cell death
(results not shown).
induction of ngal mrna expression by other agents

western blotting

proteins in the culture media (30 µl) or cell lysate (100 µg) were
separated by sds/page (12 % gels). the separated proteins
were electrophoretically transferred on to immobilontm transfer
membranes (millipore, bedford, ma, u.s.a.) and incubated
with a blocking solution, 5 % dry milk in tbst [25 mm
tris/hcl (ph 7.6)/200 mm nacl/0.15 % (v/v) tween 20], for
1 h at room temperature. ngal protein levels were measured
by immunoblotting using rabbit polyclonal antiserum specific for
corresponding proteins at 1:500 or 1:1000 dilutions. blots were
washed for three 15 min periods at room temperature with tbst,
and then incubated for 1 h with secondary goat anti-rabbit,
peroxidase-linked antibodies (1:5000 dilution; santa cruz biotechnology, santa cruz, ca, u.s.a.) in a blocking solution. blots
were then washed (3 × 15 min). bands were visualized by ecl
(enhanced chemiluminescence) according to the manufacturer’s
protocol (amersham, piscataway, nj, u.s.a.).
statistics

data were analysed using anova followed by the newman–
keuls test analyses. data are presented as the means +
− s.e.m.
p values less than 0.05 were considered significant.

to determine whether the induction of ngal expression was
specific to mk886 or was a more general response to inducers of
apoptosis, we analysed ngal mrna expression in cells treated
with several additional apoptosis-inducing xenobiotics by
northern blotting. two  xxxg1718xxx  inhibitors that induce apoptosis
[19] were tested in a549 cells. both compounds clearly increased
ngal mrna levels at 16 h (figure 4a). in addition, two  xxxd3521xxx  analogues that induce apoptosis in mcf7 cells [25] also
induced ngal mrna expression in this cell line (figure 4b).
thus ngal expression is induced in response to a number of
distinct xenobiotics that induce apoptosis.
ngal protein and apoptosis

the up-regulation of ngal expression in response to treatment
of two different human cell lines with xenobiotics that induce
apoptosis, the correlation of this induction with the extent of apoptosis, and the previous correlations with the homologous murine
 xxxg1309xxx  [15] raised the possibility that ngal is involved in cell death
signalling. to test this idea, a549 cells were treated with purified
recombinant ngal at several concentrations up to 150 µg/
106 cells. no effects on proliferation or cell viability were observed up to 72 h (results not shown). thus exogenous ngal

was unable to trigger cell death pathways.
up-regulation of ngal reduced cell sensitivity to apoptosis

to test further the involvement of ngal in cell survival, several
a549 cell clones stably overexpressing ngal were generated.

the levels of ngal protein secreted into the medium after 48 h
from two clones (1a and 2b; the latter is with a flag tag) are
shown in figure 5(a). as compared with the vector-transfected
cells, the mobility of flag-tagged ngal proteins was slightly
slower than endogenous ngal. endogenous ngal protein can
also be seen in the 2b lane. ngal protein was measurable in
a cell extract from the overexpressing, but not the vector-transfected, cells (figure 5b). both a control transfectant and the
two ngal-overexpressing clones were treated for 20 h with
10 µm osu03012. using the celltiter aq assay (figure 5c), it

by cell death elisa assay (figure 5e). thus overexpression
of ngal protects cells from apoptosis induced by these compounds.

to determine whether blocking ngal had any effects, a549 cells
were incubated with the antisera against the full-length ngal
antibody. the specificity of this antibody is shown in figure 6(a).
media from a549 cells showed only minor non-specific bands
when treated with control antisera. however, the ngal antisera
recognized this protein without any significant cross-reactivity
with other proteins in the media. the ngal antisera were highly
toxic to a549 cells, with a large decrease in total cell number,
an increase in condensed nuclei (figure 6b) and the cleavage of
caspase-3 shown, indicative of apoptosis (figure 6c).

down-regulation of ngal increased cell sensitivity
to the toxicity of osu03012

the hypothesis that ngal exerts protective activities was tested
further by down-regulating the expression of this gene with
sirna. a549 cells were transfected with three different sirnas
(25 nm) targeting the ngal mrna sequence. using real-time
rt-pcr, reductions in ngal mrna of 63, 79 and 30 % were
achieved at 72 h with sirna#1, #2 and #3 respectively (figure 7a). with densitometry, a 65 % decrease in ngal protein
in the media was evident with sirna #2 compared with both
controls (figure 7a, inset). thus ngal sirna #2 was used for
further studies. the sirna transfection procedure alone at 25 nm
sirna had no effect on cell proliferation from 72–80 h after
transfection, as assessed by the promega proliferation assay
(results not shown). however, the toxicity of 10 µm osu03012
over 8 h was increased, with the negative control sirna directed
against no known gene. this is shown by the 55 % decline in
proliferation relative to non-transfected cells (figure 7b). this
was not due to effects on ngal protein (figure 7a), but may be
due to increased permeability of the cells from the transfection
reagents (a common problem with sirna) leading to increased

presence of sirna #2, as shown by a further significant decrease
in proliferation (figure 7b). this indicates that the loss of ngal
is detrimental to these cells.
discussion

ngal is induced in different cell lines and tissues by a range
of stimuli, including il-1 in a549 cells [26] and igf (insulin-like growth factor) or tgf-alpha (transforming growth factor alpha)
in primary human keratinocytes [27]. the present results demonstrate that induction also occurs in two human epithelial cell
lines (a549 and mcf7) in response to several apoptosis-inducing xenobiotics. interestingly, these ngal-inducing agents are
related to lipoxygenase or cox-2 inhibitors, suggesting some
similarities in their apoptotic mechanisms. this potential link
is strengthened by the finding that ngal is highly induced in
inflammatory colorectal diseases and in several cancers [28],
including colorectal cancer [5], the cancer where cox-2 inhibitors have shown some efficacy [29,30]. furthermore, all of the
agents that induce ngal also inhibit  xxxg118xxx   xxxg1890xxx /akt ([19],
and z. tong and j. p. kehrer, unpublished work), and all are toxic
to tumour cells, but relatively non-toxic to normal cells ([25],
and z. tong and j. p. kehrer, unpublished work). this raises the
interesting question of whether the induction of ngal is simply
a marker for such differential toxicity, or is perhaps involved
functionally.

ngal and apoptosis

the precise biological roles of ngal are not fully known,
although a number of functions have been postulated. for
example, elevated ngal expression in certain human neoplastic
diseases [6,7,31] and its association with  xxxg1440xxx  [11] suggest
a role in tumour progression. up-regulated ngal expression in
the colon epithelium is associated with a variety of inflammatory
conditions [5], and its induction by  xxxg1170xxx  in a549 cells [26]
demonstrates an involvement in immunomodulation. like the
induction of the murine  xxxg1309xxx  by mk886, the induction of ngal
in a549 cells by this chemical correlated with apoptosis. this correlation has led to the conclusion that  xxxg1309xxx , and by inference
ngal, is pro-apoptotic. however, the current data strongly suggest that ngal plays a role in cell survival. thus the induction of
ngal in response to apoptotic stressors may be a compensatory
response that involves cell defence pathways. this conclusion is
supported by the findings that: (1) purified recombinant ngal
protein was completely non-toxic; (2) antibodies against fulllength ngal were highly toxic; (3) decreasing ngal expression
by sirna resulted in significantly less cell proliferation following
xenobiotic treatment; and (4) the overexpression of ngal significantly reduced cell death by apoptosis-inducing agents related to
cox-2 and lipoxygenase inhibitors.
additional support for the survival activity of ngal comes
from sorensen et al. [27], who reported that ngal was strongly
induced by growth factors including igf and tgf-alpha in primary
human keratinocytes. this induction is believed to play a role
in wound healing. furthermore, ngal can protect against acute
ischaemic renal injury [12], and down-regulation of exfabp, a
related chicken lipocalin, by transient transfection with antisense
exfabp induces apoptosis in chicken embryo chondrocytes [32].
finally, there is a positive correlation between ngal expression
and proliferation (s-phase fraction) in human breast tumours [6].
overall, the available data provide some substantial evidence
that the synthesis and secretion of ngal may be important for
survival of several distinct cell types.
this conclusion regarding the survival function of ngal
differs from that reached with the mouse analogue  xxxg1309xxx  [12,13].
the reasons for this difference are not clear. our previous interpretation [15] was based on the correlation between expression
and apoptosis and the diminished toxicity seen in fl5.12 cells
stably expressing antisense to  xxxg1309xxx . however, if  xxxg1309xxx  is a
survival factor, this latter procedure would only yield highly resistant cells through the clonal selection process. excess  xxxg1309xxx 
could also be perceived as pro-apoptotic if it excessively
sequesters growth factors; a process that would be detrimental
to highly growth-factor-dependent cells, such as fl5.12.
the mechanisms underlying the toxicity of the antisera against
the complete ngal protein are not clear. simply preventing the
uptake of growth factors is unlikely to be the sole explanation
because a549 cells survive, and even proliferate, for lengthy times
in the absence of serum. in contrast with the polyclonal rabbit
antisera, a commercial mouse monoclonal ngal antibody obtained from the antibody shop (gentofte, denmark) was nontoxic (z. tong and j. p. kehrer, unpublished work). this may be
because it recognizes a different epitope and/or was generated
using only a portion of the ngal protein (amino acid residues
21–198). it is also possible that binding to ngal on cell surface
receptors is critical to elicit toxicity.
extracellular stimuli are able to activate both apoptotic and
anti-apoptotic pathways. for instance, uv irradiation of primary
human keratinocytes at a dose sufficient to induce apoptosis
activates pi3k (phosphoinositide 3-kinase)/akt survival pathways, and the blockage of the pi3k/akt pathway by  xxxd2523xxx 
enhances uv-induced apoptosis [33]. similar activation of both
pro-survival and pro-apoptotic pathways has been reported in

447

rn46a neuronal cells stimulated with hypoxia [34] and in prostate and breast cancer cells, and fibroblast cells treated to induce
apoptosis with serum deprivation, etoposide or the mitochondrial
toxin bmd188 [35]. therefore the balance between proand anti-apoptosis signals determines cell fate after exposure to
toxic reagents. this concept has been extended by suggesting that,
in the presence of apoptotic stimuli, surviving cells become more
resistant to apoptosis so that not too many cells kill themselves
[36]. the induction of a secreted protein like ngal, which
occurs before substantial apoptosis ensues, may be part of such a
survival response. thus ngal may be involved not only in the
maintenance of cell growth, but also in a general defence against
toxic stimuli.
lipocalins are secreted proteins that are capable of binding
small lipophilic substances [1]. studies on the structure of ngal
have not revealed the preferred ligand, but have shown that
it binds n-formyl-met-leu-phe, a neutrophil chemoattractant,
as well as other lipophilic mediators of inflammation such as
leukotrienes and lipopolysaccharide [37]. ngal is also able to
bind  xxxg1440xxx  and protect it from degradation [11]. in addition,
ngal exhibits a very high affinity for bacterial catecholate-type
ferric siderophores, and can interfere with siderophore-mediated
iron acquisition [10]. it is possible that ngal protects cells
from toxic stress through an interaction with certain proteins,
thereby modulating the functions of those proteins. other possible
mechanisms underlying the survival effect of ngal may be
an ability of this protein to act as a scavenger for unwanted
endogenous or exogenous compounds (such as the xenobiotics
used in the present study). in support of this notion, lechner
et al. [38] reported that human tear lipocalin (lcn-1) is induced
by oxidative stress, including h2 o2 and feso4 in nt2 cells, and
it acts as a scavenger of potentially harmful lipid peroxidation
products. in conjunction with their binding activity, lipocalins
are generally considered as transporters of a variety of small
molecules [1]. ngal has been identified as an iron-transporting
protein [2]. it is well known that the delivery of iron to cells is
crucial for cell growth and development. therefore the functions
of ngal in the support of cell survival may occur through the
transport of iron, retinal or other molecules that make cells more
resistant to toxic stress.
in summary, ngal is induced by a number of apoptosisinducing xenobiotics. down-regulation of ngal expression by
sirnas decreases further the inhibition of proliferation induced
by a  xxxg1718xxx  inhibitor, while overexpression of ngal reduced cell
death induced by this compound. in addition, purified ngal
protein has no cytotoxic effects, whereas an antiserum against
full-length ngal is toxic. thus, although the induction of ngal
expression correlates with the induction of apoptosis, it would
appear that ngal is a survival factor involved in cellular defences
against toxic stimuli. down-regulation of ngal expression in
certain tumour cells may be a possible approach to improving the
response of cancer cells to treatment.
